 State Minister and Trinamool Congress MLA Ashish Banerjee claimed that on Wednesday the VHP held a proselytizing ceremony at Khurmadana village in Rampurhat in Birbhum district and got more than 100 Christians converted

 hamen yah kahana he ki agar jabaran dharmaataran kaa koi sanket bhi miltaa he to mudde ko yathasambhav kathorta se nipta jayega

 Sinha said, 'the charge of conversion is false
 yah 'ghar vaapasi' nahin balki dharmik samaaroh tha jisamen kuch isai pariwaron sahit adhikansh gaanv vaasiyon ne bhaag liya
 We have always welcomed those wishing to return to Hinduism

 Today, during our 8
 5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago 
 While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea? So we went in to the home of this beautiful and warm family who had absolutely no idea who we were and yet they treated us with such warmth and love
 We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers ! Whoever knows virat and me very closely, know that both of us live for such moments of genuine , simple & pure human connection 
 It fills us with such joy and peace knowing that they just wanted to be kind to two random foreigners (plus our guide) without seeking anything in return

 Siddharth Malhotra, who ventured into the industry from the film 'student of the Year', will soon be seen alongside Akshay Kumar in the film 'brothers' as his boxer brother
 siddharth se hui khaas mulaakaat main siddharth ne 14 agast ko relies hone ja rahi apni is film ke bare main kai baaten share kin
 Have you heard that you have gained a lot of weight for the film 'brothers'? On the basis of Akshay Kumar's height, director Karan Malhotra suggested that i have to gain weight and Akshay has to lose weight and now when i see the frame of the film itself i see that the idea of karan was really right
 aapane marshall art bhi siikhaa?haa,akshaysar to specialist hai, lekin mujhe iskaa koi gyaan nahin tha to lagbhag 4 maheene tak maine isaki training lee agar akshay kumaar ke saamne aap fiter nahin lagate ho, to aisi film karne kaa koi matlab nahin tha
 Now i am happy to see the trailer that let's get a little better
 fitness ke dauraan aapako kuch mushkilon kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa kya?bahut mushkil kaam tha kyonki ek to mujhe vajan badhanaa tha or upar se main 5-5 ghante kii training bhi chal rahi thi
 Sometimes boxing, sometimes jujutsu, sometimes kicking, it was very difficult to eat food and training too fiercely
 international trainurs ne kaaphi madad kii
 He taught me many things in a very short time
 kya aapane akshay se bhi kuch tips liye?unki fitness kii to daad detaa hum main, jis tarah se wo grip pakadte hai, wo behtareen he
 We both have a lot of things in common, both are from Delhi, both are Punjabi, both are from outside the industry, both are fond of food, both get up early in the morning
 meri aadaton se wo bahut hi khush hote hai
 His discipline is worthy
 akshay ke saath kya aapane set par mouj masti kii?haa set par wo kaaphi kuch karte rahete the
 Sometimes spraying, sometimes pulling legs, sometimes joking
 ek shot ke dauraan unhone mujhase kaha ki 'main kik maar rahaa hum or tu guard pahan le', maine unki baat maan lee, or jaise hi unhone kik maari uske baad ek guard unke haath main, jise dekhakar main sharminda ho gaya or jatke se dekha to meraa guard to vahiin laga hua tha lekin akshay ne koi or gord haath main lekar mere saath majaak kiya tha
 So there were often many such jokes
 sochie gambhir film ke dauraan aise aise majaak karte rahete the
 What is the specialty of this film? This will be the first time in our film that men are going to cry
 clymex ke dauraan aisa bhavuk kshan hota he jab main, akshay sar or jaiki sar, teenon rote hai
 So it will be the first time that three men will be seen crying together and many people will be emotional while watching the film
 yahaan tak kii akshay kumaar ne bhi dabing ke dauraan kaha kii unki ankhen bhi bhar ai thi
 You Varun Dhawan and Alia stepped into this industry together and today all three of you are busy in your work, do you ever get to talk about each other's projects? 
 lekin projects kii charchaa nahin hoti
 i was shooting with Aaliyah, messages keep coming
 vaise karan malhotra'bros'kii shooting se pehle 'shuddhi' kii planning bhi kar rahe the or phir film varun ke paas chali gai
 Did you ever think that Shuddhi could do you too? We knew about the film but i was already working with Karan and how many films would be done at the same time with the same director
 ab wo jamaana bhi nahin he ki ek actor or diarector kii jodi ko log pachaas baar dekhne aaenge
 Which star do you want to work with in your industry? i have had a great experience with Akshay sir but i am a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan
 agar unke saath mujhe film main kaam karne kaa mauka mili to mere liye yah behad khushi kii baat hogi
 Do you consult Karan Johar about your projects? He has launched us, i am grateful to him
 unki vajah se main kaam or intervyuu kar rahaa hum
 i keep getting advice from them about my projects
 khabaren thi ki katrina aapse naaraaz hai?main khud tees kaa hum wo bhi tees kii hai(hansate hue)
 We are still doing a look test
 aisa kuch nahin he, ham log ek lav story kar rahe hai, wo mujhase khafa bilkul nahin hai

 ) kareeb do karod kii aabaadi vaale dilli shahar main ek shaks puure 29 minute tak patharilii sadak par padaa rahaa or do madadgaar haathon ke liye tadapata rahaa, sisakata rahaa
 During this time 140 cars passed by him
 181 motorcycle savaar gujarey
 82 autos passed
 45 rahgeer nikle
 But no one extended a helping hand
 aakhir main usee patharilii sadak par patthardil insaanon ke saamne tadap-tadap kar usne dam tod diya
 Now you tell me what to cry about such death? Do not open the doors and windows of the houses
 vaise bhi is shahar main shaayad hi kisi kii madad ke liye koi apane daravaaje yaa khidkiyaan kholta ho
 But here he was lying in front of the eyes on the beach
 patharilii sadak lagaataar uske risatekhunse laal ho rahi thi
 Every passing moment was cutting the strings of his breath
 par kisi ne nahin, kisi ne uskimdadanheen kii
 And then he died on this stony road
 kya khub tarakkee kii he hamane
 Departed from the houses and reached the flat
 mohallon ko alavida kahkar colony tak aa gaye
 Leaving his own and his neighbors, he formed his own society around him
 apane aasapaas oonchi-oonchi imaaraton kii deevaaren taan deen
 And then started telling Fakhr that we live in the city
 ham dilli main rahete hai
 But are we all really alive? Are we really living? Or have we all become dead themselves in the midst of a crowd of dead people? Actually these disturbing pictures are of Subhash Nagar area of west Delhi

 auto ne maari takkardansal ek shaks saamne kii taraf ja rahaa he
 His move is telling that he is tired
 par phir bhi sadak kinare chal rahaa he
 He had just surfed in the camera for six seconds when a very high speed tampo comes and hits him from behind so hard that he bounces in the air and falls on the left side of the road
 nite girte hi ab wo lagbhag besudh sa ho chukaa tha
 On the other hand, the balance of the tempo also deteriorates for a moment, but then the driver stops the car and stops it on the middle road
 iske baad tampo driver neeche utarataa he or gum kar us shaks kii taraf badhane lagata he, jise usne abhi-abhi takkar maari he
 For a moment he felt that he was moving to help him
 magar agle hi pal galatfahami dur ho jaati he
 The tampo driver stops abruptly as he goes close to him and then leaves him dead and starts to see the part of his tampo that he had hit
 iske baad pare itmeenaan se wo waapas mudata he, or tampon main baith kar chalaa jaataa he
 It seems as if nothing has happened
 sadak par pade-pade chillaata rahouse shaks ke sir par gahari chot lagi thi
 Many other parts of the body were also injured
 khun lagaataar ris rahaa tha
 But he still kept on the same rocky road
 paas main hi sadak kinare barsaati pani jamaa tha
 The blood was slowly turning that water red
 usamen itani himmat or jaan nahin thi ki khud khadaa hota, aspataal jaataa yahaan tak ki madad ke liye cheekhta-chillaata
 Just his eyes were getting buried in the eyes of pain
 par jism main jaan ab bhi baaki thi
 The breath was still going on
 rukne main kar di derkarib-kareeb aadha ghanta hone ko tha
 During this period, many humans passed by, on foot, in trains, motor vehicles
 kisi kii najar padi
 Nobody's
 kisi ne sidhi najar daali to kisi ne kanakhiyon se dekha
 Some changed their eyes and some changed their eyes
 or phir aakhir main achaanak do log aate hai
 Surprisingly both also stop
 ham sabko hairaan karte hue donon us jakhmi shaks ko choote bhi hai
 His pulse is also searched
 magar afsos ab der ho chuki thi

 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama aitihaasik yatra par somvaar ko cuba pahunch gaye
 For the first time since 1928, an American President has arrived in Cuba

 These may be possible reasons why Cuba got the idea of the US President after nearly 88 years
 1
 Getting his name listed in the pages of history - There may be many reasons behind US President Barack Obama's visit to Cuba, but the most important may be his attempt to memorialize his image as a President
 baraak obama ne takreeban 90 saal baad is yatra par aakar chaahe virodhiyon kii aalochana jheli ho par saath hi apana naam itihaas ke pannon main bhi darj karvaa liya
 Barack Obama, who is nearing the end of his term, has done this work for his personal benefit

 Foreign Policy: - After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, all kinds of relations between the two countries were over

 US President Barack Obama is making the visit as part of the reform of foreign policy
 3
 Economic Policy: - President Obama's visit to Cuba may also be aimed at ending the long-standing trade embargo
 america ne pichley 55 saalon se cuba par aarthik pratibandh laga rakhe hai jisase kai mahatvapurn chijen jaise chini, hawana cigar yahaan nahin aa sakati

 HD Deve Gowda Janata Dal leader HD Deve Gowda becoming PM was also shocking
 haalanki baahar se samarthan de rahi congress ke haath khinch lene se unki pari das maah main hi khatm ho gai
 He became the Prime Minister of the country on 1 June 1996 and had to withdraw from the post on 21 April 1997, almost a year later

 After that the number was of the National Front, which had a total of 79 seats

 bijepi ko dobaaraa satta main aane se rokane ke liye congress ne bada daanv chalaa or rashtriya morcha ko baahar se samarthan dete hue sarkaar banane kaa ofer diya
 In such a situation, Dev Gowda immediately agreed and claimed to form the government with his 46 mlas, 17 of Samajwadi Party, 16 of Telugu Desam Party

 In 1997, IK Gujral April, the Congress supporting the government from outside, withdrew its support

 cricket ke makka lords main jab mahendra singh dhoni kii team ne shandaar jeet hasil kii to laga ki ab england ke khilaaf is siries ko jitkar hi team lautegi
 With this hope and confidence, when he landed in the third Test, he felt that something would happen but disappointing bowling and even more useless batting showed him the way to defeat
 england ne southamton main unhen dhul chataa di
 It is not only Dhoni's failure of the entire team and almost all the players are responsible for this
 ham england se har vibhaag main pichad gaye
 We missed catches at crucial times, bowled disappointingly and even more than that, battered poorly
 bhartiya team ke sabase honhaar khilaadi viraat kohli ne sabase zyada niraash kiya
 It was already believed that Virat would undergo an ordeal in England, and in which he completely failed
 vahaan ve wicket se baahar jaati gendon par khelkar out hue hi, saadhaaran gendon par bhi out hue
 His approach was not professional from anywhere
 lagata tha ki ve ab tak apni pichhali safalataa ke khumaar se dur nahin ho paae hai
 The same was the case with Cheteshwar Pujara, who is considered an alternative to Dravid
 lekin anderson kii tej or swing karti gendon par ve laachaar dikhe
 The way he got out on the ball of an ordinary spinner like Moin Ali, he felt that he is absolutely clumsy in playing spin balls
 openar shikhar dhawan kii ballebaaji kahin se sampurna nahin he or unki takanic main khot he
 The way the improvised spinner Joe Root was dismissed, the selectors' confidence would have been shaken
 murali vijay beshak behatar khel rahe hai lekin unamem vah urja nahin dikh rahi he jo har test match ke saath badhati jaani chahie
 Rohit Sharma is playing exactly like a clumsy and there is no hope beyond him
 ajinkya rahane akele bhartiya ballebaaj hai jo apni pratibha or dikhaa rahe hai, haalanki pehali pari main ve bhi kahin behatar khel sakate the
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is also seen to disappoint in batting
 agar duusari pari main ve tike rahete to shaayad yah match lanbaa khinch jaataa
 Dhoni will have to work harder in his batting only then we will be able to win the next Test match which is necessary to equalize the series
 ballebaajon ke saath-saath gendbaajon ne bhi puri tarah niraash kiya
 No bowler could show up
 eshanth sharma kii kami kaa asar saaf dikhaa
 Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pankaj Singh were completely disappointed
 unki gendon main na to gati thi or na hi swing
 Jadeja was nothing more than an improvisational bowler
 ab nigahen old traverd par hai jahaan bhartiya spinner acha pradarshan karte aae hai
 But our problem is that now we do not even have world class spinners
 aar aswin kul milakar bhartiya pichon ke hi spinner hai
 In the next Test, we can only expect him to do something
 yahaan par yah zikr karnaa anuchit nahin hoga ki england ke saadhaaran se spin gedbaaj moin ali ne bharat ke behtareen ballobaajon ke chakke chhudaa die or puri team ko haar ke raste par bhej diya to hamaare spinner kyon nahin aisa kar paae? aise kai sawaal is test match se uth rahe hai jinke jawaab agle test main milane chahie
 It would be very disappointing if we could not save the series after the victory at Lord's

 Jordan's Prime Minister Abdullah Insaur said on Sunday that it is impossible to cancel a peace deal with Israel under the current circumstances
 abdulla ne kaha ki samjhauta radd karne ke rajnatik, suraksha or sainya parinaam ho sakate hai
 He said, "this issue cannot be discussed in this situation
 " He said that if either party wants to cancel the agreement, there should be an alternative
 samachar agency sinhua ke mutabik, abdulla ne kaha ki agar jordan 1994 kaa samjhauta radd karnaa chahta he, to uske liye taiyaari kii jarurat hogi
 Significantly, Jordan withdrew his ambassador from Tel Aviv last week after the Israeli proliferation in East Jerusalem and the ban on entry into the Al Aqsa Mosque
 yah pehla mauka he jab upi bijepi ke sheersh se lekar booth tak kii cametiyon ke netaaon kaa ‘data base’ taiyaar ho rahaa he
 On the lines of the photo-voter list, some of the leaders of the organization are busy in preparing a photo-rich list of large to small leaders of the state BJP leaders
 pradesh main 1
 Work on 70 per cent of the 3
2 million booths has been completed
 aktubar main gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bijepi chunaav abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh narendra modi ke upi main garajane se pehle baaki kaam bhi nibata diya jayega
 This was the first task Amit Shah gave to party leaders as soon as he took charge as UP BJP in-charge in May
 gujarat ke safal prayog ko upi main utaarne kii ranneeti ke tahat bijepi booth str par sanghathan ko sakriy karne ke liye sthaneey netaaon ke pate se lekar mobile number tak juta rahi he, taaki unase party kii jamini hakeekat kii jaankaree sheersh par baithe netaa sidhe le saken
 As an experiment, Amit Shah has started implementing it himself
 ve niyamit taur par party ke booth kaaryakartaaon ko phone kar gaanv or shahar main ward str par party kii sakriyata kaa feedback le rahe hai
 Not only this, Shah has also created a plan for radical changes in the party's economic structure
 unhone pradesh ke ek booth se kam-se-kam 1,000 ru
 The goal of mobilizing is given to the workers
 party ke duusare netaa bhi apane liye nirdhaarit lakshya ke anusaar chanda jutaayenge
 On the lines of Gujarat, Shah has also tried to mobilize media support in UP
 6 july ko ayodhya jane se pehle unhone lakhanu ke sabhi media daftaron ke chakkar lagaakar bijepi ke liye sahyog maanga
 This was the reason that the media's stance on Shah's visit to Ayodhya remained positive
 ayodhya se shuruyaat kar shah ne yah bina kahe hi bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke bich aane vaale dinon main party ke rukh kaa sanket kar diya
 The role of BJP mlas in Muzaffarnagar riots and attempts to capture the stage in Jat panchayat is clear that BJP is benefiting from the politics of polarization in UP
 shah abhi puri tarah se khulkar nahin khel rahe, lekin sandesh yahi gaya he ki modi ne ranneeti ke tahat shah ko upi kaa prabharee banwaaya he
 But Shah's challenge is to keep big leaders of UP BJP close
 isaki pahal karte hue unhone 13 june ko lakhanu ke apane pehle daure main sabase pehle calraj mishra, kalyaan singh, lalji tandon jaise varisht netaaon ke ghar pahunch kar yah jataa diya ki upi main bhale hi party alag-alag khaanchon main banty ho magar narendra modi ke naam par sabhi ko ekajute hokar praytn karne honge
 He has directed all the co-incharge to camp continuously in their allotted areas
 upi prabharee ke taur par teen maheene se zyada kaa arsa gujaarne ke dauraan shah kaa puraa jor sthaneey str par un kaaryakartaaon ko party kii mukhyadhara main laane kaa he, jo pichley 20 varshon ke dauraan bijepi se chhitak kar duusare dalon kii ore chale gaye hai
 Since becoming in-charge, Shah has found out the reasons for the party's weakness by taking feedback from activists in Gorakhpur, Faizabad, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Jhansi
 shah ne upi bijepi ko pradesh kii sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf ban rahe maahaul kaa zyada se zyada laabh lene kii ranneeti par amal karne kaa ek rodmap bhi saunpa he
 Under this, the party will intensify anti-government protest to the booth level

 shahrukh khan ke production main bani imran hashmi kii nai web siries netflix par aa chuki he
 Fans have been eagerly waiting for this web series for a long time and when it has come, people are not tired of talking about it
 lekhak bilal siddiki kii kitaab board of blad par bani is web siries kii kahani duusari spai thriller siries yaa filmon se zyada alag nahin he, lekin behatar jarur he
 The web series features Emraan Hashmi, Sobhita Dhulipala, Vineet Kumar Singh and Jaideep Ahlawat
 iske alaava kirti kulhari, rajit kapur, shishir sharma, amit bimrot, danish hossain sang kai achche actors saporting cast main hai
 What is the story? The story of the web series is that some secret agents of India have been caught by the Taliban in Balochistan
 aise main IIW (indian Intelligence Wing) india ke chif (rajit kapur) apane puraane or best agent ko baluchistan bhejkar baaki agents kii jaan bachaana chaahate hai
 But the past of this old agent Kabir Anand (emraan Hashmi) is coming in the way of this mission
 ab kya kabir mishan par jayega or agar wo kya to kya wo apane makasad main kaamyaab ho paaegaa? iske saath hi kya kabir ke raste main mushkilon ke pahaad hai, jinhen use khud paar karnaa he
 Talking about the performance of the actors in the series is powerful, its biggest strength is the performance of the actors and the cinematography of the series
 iske alaava chizon main aap kamiyaan nikaal sakate hai
 In this show the story is cleared from the first episode and you also get a big reason to think
 pehle episod se hi siries aapako apane saath jod leti he
 Kabir, living in sorrow and fear of a failed mission, becomes more attached to him as you see him on his screen
 uski pareshaaniyaan aapako apni lagati hai or aap mishan ko kisi bhi haal main puraa hota dekhnaa chaahate hai
 However, there are many such moments in this series when you miss Bollywood movies
 kuch seens or sikvence aapako thakaate hai
 It becomes a little difficult to bear that moment
 kabir shuru se ek team lekar akelaa chal rahaa he
 Yes, every person in this team is following Kabir's orders but he is also responsible for his life
 kam se kam kabir to sabhi ko yahi kahata he
 The characters shown in the series are very strong
 bhale hi wo kabir anand (imran hashmi) ho, isha khanna (sobhitha dhulipala), vir (vineet kumaar singh) yaa phir shahzad (jayadeep ahlavat) yaa nihaar (amit bimrot)
 The performance of all actors, including Emraan Hashmi, is unmatched
 wo chaahe imran, sobhitha, jayadeep or vineet ho yaa beuro chif ho yaa BAF ke chif nushrat yaa phir taliban ke mukhiya or bandi bane agents
 There are many actors in this web series and all have played their character well

 # bardofblood # netflixindia # redchilliesenta post shared byemraan Hashmi (@therealemraan) onsep 27, 2019 at 9:02 am PDT The story of Kabir's failed mission may make you look a bit spoiled
 kabir anand kii lav story bhi kuch khaas nahin he
 This web series is full of action with less dialogue
 blast, goliyaan chalanaa, mardhaad or khun kharaba aapako is siries main bharpoor milegaa
 In this series, you will enjoy watching the interrupted twists and turns, the driving of agents and minor mistakes
 itnaa hi nahin siries ek aise bade twist par khatm hoti he, jahaan se iske aage jane ke kaaphi asaar hai
 So fans can also hope that maybe Bard of Blood 2 will also come on Netflix

 All have been killed by the security forces, but it is being said that the body of the sixth terrorist is yet to be found
 pakistani seemaa se lagbhag 25 kilometre kii duuri par bane airforce base par hue hamale main saat surakshakarmi shahid hue tathaa 20 log ghayal hue
 The government believes that the entry of six terrorists into India from across the border on the night between 31 December and 1 January is a huge security lapse

 Sources told the news agency Reuters, in fact, the phone call made by police superintendent Salvinder Singh to a colleague on Friday morning after his car was hijacked was initially deemed to be a case of robbery
 baad main salwinder singh ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki unhen agava karne vaale logon ke paas eke-47 riflein thim
 Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi said that the presence of the attackers in Pathankot became clear by Friday afternoon, when more than 12 hours had elapsed after Salvinder's car was kidnapped
 baharhaal, naagarik prashasan tathaa sainya adhikariyon ke anusaar, suraksha alert turant hi bhej diya gaya tha, taaki aatankwaadi ladaaku vimaanon yaa helicopteron ko nuksaan na pahunchaa saken
 The car of SP Salvinder Singh was left by the terrorists about one and a half kilometers away from the base, and after entering the base, they reached the mess of the guards and started firing indiscriminately
 tippaniyan The government and intelligence agencies are most concerned about the fact that the terrorists managed to sneak into the Pathankot air force base even after the sp's car was hijacked, while security arrangements were extended from midnight on Friday

 Analysts and officials say the attackers may have come from factions, one of which had abducted the sp's car, and two other militants entered the base separately
 base par puri tarah niyantran sunishchit karne ke liye abhiyaan philhal chauthe din bhi jari he
 The base was attacked by a group of six militants early Saturday, and is believed to have arrived from Pakistan

 After this, on January 1, the security cordon of the Pathankot Air Force Base was easily dismantled despite an alert by a senior police officer's car hijacking by militants wearing army uniforms

 Analysts believe that a major weakness of this base could be its 24-km circumference, which is not easy to monitor everywhere on a 10-foot-high wall with barbed wire

 Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand, known for his controversial speech, has once again given rise to a controversy by making a controversial statement
 unhone mahatma gandhi ko rashtrapita kahe jane par aapatti jataai he
 While objecting to Mahatma Gandhi being called the Father of the Nation, he said that Gandhi is the Father of the Nation and not the Father of the Nation
 kuch samay ke liye katni padhaare main dwarkapith keshankaracharya swami swaroopanandane media se charchaa main kaha ki mahatma gandhi ko log rashtrapita kehete hai jabaki yah puri tarah galat he
 Our country existed before the birth of Mahatma Gandhi
 aise main unhen rashtrapita kaise kaha ja saktaa he? yah jarur he ki mahatma gandhi ne desh kii aazaadee ke liye ladai ladi or is drushti se unhen raashtra putr kaha janaa uchit hoga
 This is not the first time that Shankaracharya has been making such statements even before he has a neoclassical statement
 sai baba ko avatar maanane se kiya tha inkaradwarkapith ke shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati ne shiridy ke sai baba ko lekar chaunkaane vaale bayaan diya tha
 He refused to consider Sai Baba as an avatar
 saath hi unhone kaha tha kisaai bhaktachahen to unki puja karen, lekin iske baad unhen bhagwaan ram kaa naam lenaa, ganga snaan karnaa or 'har har mahadev' kahana chhod dena chahie
 Not only this, Vano has also attributed the worship of Sai Baba to the drought in Maharashtra and elsewhere
 unhone kaha tha ki jo sookhaa pad rahaa he wo sirf isliye he kyonki log sai baba kii puja kar rahe hai
 He said that if the drought is to be avoided, then the worship of Sai should stop immediately
 maharashtra ke aradhy bhagwaan ganesh he isliye ganesh kii puja honi chahie
 He said that Ganesh is inhabited in Maharashtra, but Pooja is being performed by Sai
 jis bhagwaan kii puja honi chahie, uskaa niraadar ho rahaa he
 'atrocities on women will stop when they stop worshiping Shani' Shankaracharya Swaroopanand also questioned the entry of women in Shani Shingnapur in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha tha ki jis tarah se mahilaon par atyaachaar ho rahe hai wo tab tak nahin rukenge jab tak mahilaayein shani kii puja karnaa band nahin karengi
 The entry of women in the temple will increase the crimes against them
 mahilaon ke saath rape jaisi ghatnaayen adhik hongi
 He said that Shani is not a god, but a house is peaceful and worship is not done

 abdula ne kaha ki ek hi baat se rasta nikal saktaa he ki bharat or pakistan baatcheet karen or rasta nikaalen
 Contrary to the resolution passed in 1994 in Afarooq Abdullane Parliament on the 28th death anniversary of Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's father-in-law and former Congress leader Girdhari Lal Dogra in Jammu, the pok (pakistan Occupied Kashmir) is a part of Pakistan
 'agar bharat kaa hissaa he to le kyon nahin liya'faruk abdula ne kaha, 'pioke pakistan kaa hissaa he or rahegaa, jabaki yah kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he or rahegaa, ek hi baat se rasta nikal saktaa he kibharat or pakistanbaatcheet karen or rasta nikaalen
 He also said that it has been many years, saying that it is a part of India

 jo is tarah kii bayaanbaji kar rahe he unako yah maaloom nahin ki parliament kaa prastaav desh kaa prastaav hota he or kanoonee taur par paak adhikrut kashmir bharat kaa atoot ang he
 'do not tolerate thinking against the country' Nirmal Singh said, 'the Parliament's resolution of 1994 says that if there is any issue with Pakistan, it is the POK, which is part of Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin yah hamaare liye myne nahin he
 This thinking puts a question mark on Jammu and Kashmir and the country, which is not tolerated at all

 it is a shame
 iskaa bahishkaar hona chahie
 'sharda Peeth Keshankaracharya has told Aamir Khan's film against Hinduism
 swaroopanand kehete hai ki aisi filmein nahin banani chahie or sensor board ko aisi filmein paas bhi nahin kerani chahie
 Swaroopananda Saraswati has objected to the sarcasm done against Hindu deities in the film, saying that objectionable scenes have been shot in the film
 unhone poocha ki aakhirkaar film banane waalon ko sirf hindu dharm main hi khot kyon najar aati he? shankaracharya ke kaha, film nirmaataa anya dharmon ke khilaaf film banaaenge to unhen 'thik' kar diya jayega

 The recruiters who come to our Uttar Pradesh ask that we are not getting the person of the quality for the post we are hiring
 kami he to yogya logon kii
 The Labor Minister said that we work to look after this ministry
 isliye mujhe jaankaree he ki desh main rojgaar kii koi kami nahin he
 There is a lot of employment
 rojgaar daftar ke alawa hamaara mantralay bhi isaki monitering kar rahaa he
 The point of recession is understandable, but there is no lack of employment
 mumbai ke patrkaar je
 Police have detained three people in the Dey murder case
 inamen do logon kii giraftaar mumbai se, jabaki ek ko pune giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The police also claimed to have recovered the bike used in the murder
 giraftaar kiye gaye teenon badmaashon kaa taalluk chota shakeel giroh se bataaya ja rahaa he
 It is not yet known whose direction J
 de ko teen minute ke andar goliyon se chalni kar diya gaya
 By the way, police are now looking for those people who are the witnesses of this incident
 lekin je
 No police officer in Mumbai has an answer for when Dey's killers will be caught
 supreme court ke haive kinare 500 meter kii duuri tak sharaab kii dukaan nahin kholane ke aadesh se paar paane ke liye jahaan aadha darjan rajyon ne supreme court main revijan petishan lagaai he, vahiin rajasthan sarkaar ne sharaab kii kamai bachaane kaa anokhaa rasta nikaala he
 The areas on the State Highway have been denotified and made into Urban Road from the State Highway where there are liquor shops
 ajtak ke paas rajya sarkaar ke peedbludi vibhaag ke is tarah ke haive ke andar urban road banane ke liye dinotiphoi kiye gaye sadakon kii suchi he
 Meghaway from Jaipur to Jodhpur, where there is a wine shop less than 30 meters away
 lekin supreme court ke nirdesh ke tahat ye sharaab kii dukaan band hone vaali thi magar ab ye haive kinare kii sharaab dukaan band nahin hogi
 PWD Department of Rajasthan Government, 20 km from Chomu Pulia in Jaipur to Village Kalawar
 ke is haive ko urban road ghoshit kar diya he
 Similarly, in dozens of districts of Rajasthan, the government has changed the definition of highway from 2 to 30 km inside the highway itself
 yani ab is sadak par berokatoke sharaab kii dukaane khul sakati hai
 The Supreme Court's order not to open liquor shops within 500 meters of national and state highways will not apply to hundreds of shops along the highway in Rajasthan
 tum daal-daal, main paat-paat
 This proverb is right on the information department
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne sharaab kii dukaanon ko rajmargon se 500 meter kii duuri par lagane kaa aadesh diya to aabkaari vibhaag ne saarvajanik nirmaan vibhaag se patrachaar kar shahari kshetra ke rajmargon kaa darja hi samaapt karvaa diya
 The Public Works Department has declared 25 highways in the state as urban routes
 isamen balotra shahar main rajya rajmarg-28e kaa 6 kilometre kaa hissaa shaamil he
 a dozen liquor shops will now be able to operate on this
 barmer jile ke jila aabkaari adhikari devendra singh ke anusaar sarkaar ne saarvajanik nirmaan vibhaag ne pradesh main 21 rajmargon kaa darja khatm kar shahari maarg ghoshit kiya he
 It includes a 6-km stretch of State highway-28a in the city of Balotra
 jisamen ham sharaab kii dukaan khol sakate hai
 But Rajasthan PWD Minister Yunus Khan is saying that the Supreme Court's order not to open liquor shops along the highway will be followed
 peedbludi vibhaag kaa apana ajeebogareeb tark he ki in jagahon par aabaadi ho gai he isliye local bady in sadakon kii dekhbhaal kar sakate hai
 In fact, in Rajasthan, earning from alcohol is a big way for the government
 2015-16 main exaij department kii sharaab bikri se aamadani 6,700 karod thi jabaki 2017-17 kaa target 7,300 karod he
 Therefore, in view of the revenue arising out of the sale of liquor, the government has 3029 km of 21 state highways passing through 16 districts of the state
 ke aria main se 190 ki
 M
 ke aria ko dinotiphoi kar urban road bana diya he
 Rajasthan is not the only state to be troubled by this decision of the Supreme Court
 telangna ne supreme court se sitambar tak kii dedline ke liye likhaa he to kerala ne is par punarvichaar karne kii yachika supreme court main laga di he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi reached the farmers' rally protesting at Jantar Mantar in Delhi and attacked the central government fiercely
 gandhi ne kaha ki pichley saadhe chaar saal main modi sarkaar ne bharat ke sabase 15 amir logon kaa 3
 5 lakh crore debt is waived
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar desh ke amiron kaa 12
 a loan of Rs 5 lakh crore is going to be forgiven even more
 congress adhyaksh ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki agar hindustan ke 15 amiron kaa 3
 If the debt of 5 lakh crore rupees can be forgiven, then why can't the debt of crores of farmers of India be forgiven
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jayega
 Gandhi said that there are two big issues facing India today
 ek mudda hindustan ke kisaan ke bhavishya kaa mudda he or doosraa yuvaaon ke rojgaar kaa he
 Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 12 of the NPA
 5 lakh karod rupye kaa karj bhi maaf karnaa chaahate hai
 Amid the slogans, Gandhi said that the farmer of India is not asking for any gift, only his right
 rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya ki pradhanmantri ne kisaanon ko bajiv daam dilaane, emspi badhaane kaa vaada kiya tha par aaj kisaan beemaa kaa paisa anil ambani kii jeb main jaataa he
 Districts are distributed in the country, the farmer cannot even choose which company to take insurance
 unhone sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne hindustan ko ambani or adani ke bich baant rakhaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said in a Tanzia tone that the farmer of India is not asking for Anil Ambani's airplane from Modi ji, but the farmer of India is saying that if you can give Rs 30,000 crore of Indian Air Force money to Anil Ambani, If you can give 3 lakh 50 thousand crore rupees to your 15 friends, then you will have to forgive us for our hard work, for our blood, for our sweat 
 rahul gandhi ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki is desh ko koi ek vyakti nahin chalaata he, koi ek party nahin chalaati he, is desh ko kisaan, majdoor, chote dukandaar, yuva, maatayen, bahanen milakar chalaati hai
 Rahul Gandhi later tweeted: Farmers are not a burden on the country
 kisaan desh kaa saar hai
 The country's farmer is in crisis
 unki ummid tut rahi he
 He has a heartache
 ham kisaan ko akelaa nahin chhod sakate
 Whether we have to change the law, change the government or change the Prime Minister, we will support the farmer
 kisaan ke saath nyaay hoga
 Significantly, in this round of assembly elections, where voting is yet to be done in Rajasthan, and where farmers are facing difficulties in selling their crops, this rally of farmers can leave a political impact
 jantar-mantar par is kisaanon ke jutav main manch par rahul gandhi ke saath sharad yadav, farrukh abdulla jaise netaa maujuud the

 pakistani videshmantri hina rabbaani khaar ne gat saptaah niyantran rekha par ek bhartiya sainik kaa sir kaatane kii ghatana ke baad bhartiya senadhyaksh general bikram singh kii ore se kii gai tippanee ko ‘atyant aakraamak’ qaraar diya he
 Hina also said that Indian leaders should learn from the developments in their country
 unhone kaha, hamen bharat ke kai netaaon kii tippaniyan sunakar koi sukhad hairaani nahin hui he
 i believe this is something that has changed in Pakistan and India should learn from it
 hina ne kaha, senadhyaksh kii tippanee ke baad main bees varsh pehle pahunch gai
 He was asked, what did he say? Hina said, a completely offensive comment
 general singh ne yah kehete hue pakistan ko spasht chetavanee di ki bharat ke paas apni pasand ke ‘samay or sthaan’ par javaabi karrwai kaa adhikaar he
 He made a strong comment on the incident on 8 January in Mendhar area of jammu and Kashmir, saying that beheading of the soldiers was 'unacceptable' and 'extremely unforgivable' and that the soldiers would react immediately, aggressively if provoked
 tippaniyan Hina is in New York to attend a special session of the United Nations Security Council, which Pakistan presides over for the month of January
 hina ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki pakistan aaj ek aise desh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo is baat ko lekar spasht he ki use apane padosiyon ke saath kaise rahanaa he
 The way we want to be with our neighbors is to try and create an environment in which we can resolve our disputes through dialogue rather than military statements or military actions
 kashmir par ek prashn kaa uttar dete hue hina ne kaha ki unka maananaa he ki gat do saptaah pareshaan karne vaale rahe hai
 He said, there were two soldiers, who were injured in the conflict at the place which was within 400 meters of the Pakistani territory
 unamem se ek ghayal sainik ne dam tod diya
 While expressing concern, we expressed our concern from the Indian side and demanded a general system in force
 unhone kaha, us ghatana ke do yaa teen din baad ham par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki donon bhartiya sainik pakistani sainikon dwaara maare gaye
 We investigated this and we could not find any evidence that Pakistani soldiers had done this
 uske baad atyant paraspar virdohi bayaan aae ki unke sir kaate gaye
 He said, the Northern Commander spokesman said that it did not happen while others say it did
 isliye is sabake ke baad durbhaagya se gharelu raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 He said, We are not surprised to hear the comments of many leaders of India
 meraa maananaa he ki yah vah cheez he jo pakistan main badal gai he or bharat ko isse sikh leni chahie
 Hina said, i reached twenty years ago after the remarks of the Chief of Army Staff
 unase poocha gaya, unhone kya kaha? hina ne kaha, puri tarah se aakraamak tippanee
 General Singh gave a clear warning to Pakistan, saying that India has the right to retaliate at the 'time and place' of its choice
 unhone gat 8 janvari ko jammu-kashmir ke mendhar kshetra main hui ghatana par sakht tippanee karte hue kaha ki javaanon kaa sir kaatna ‘asweekaar’ or ‘atyant akshamya’ he or yadi uksaaya gaya to sainik tatkaal, aakraamak rup se pratikriya karenge
 The comments hina sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke ek vishesh satr main shaamil hone ke liye neuyork main hai, jiskaa pakistan janvari maheene ke liye adhyaksh he
 Hina said, i believe that Pakistan today represents a country which is clear about how it has to live with its neighbors
 ham jis tareeke se apane padosiyon ke saath rahanaa chaahate hai vah yah he ki prayaas karke ek aise vaataavaran kaa nirmaan kiya jaae, jisamen ham apane vivaadon kaa sainya bayanon yaa sainya karravaayiyon kii bajaay vaarta ke jariye hal kar saken
 Answering a question on Kashmir, Hina said that she believes that the last two weeks have been troublesome
 unhone kaha, do sainik the, jo sangharsh main us sthaan par ghayal ho gaye the, jo pakistani kshetra main 400 meter bheetar tha
 One of them succumbed to the wounded soldier
 hamane chintaa jataate hue apni chintaa bhartiya paksh se jataayi or lagu saamaanya vyavastha kii maang kii
 "two or three days after that incident, we were accused that both Indian soldiers were killed by Pakistani soldiers," he said
 hamane isaki jaanch kii or hamen is baat ke koi saboot nahin mili ki pakistani sainikon ne yah kiya tha
 Then came the very conflicting statements that he was beheaded
 unhone kaha, uttari commander pravaktaa ne kaha ki aisa nahin hua jabaki anya kehete hai ki aisa hua
 So after all this, unfortunately domestic politics started
 unhone gat 8 janvari ko jammu-kashmir ke mendhar kshetra main hui ghatana par sakht tippanee karte hue kaha ki javaanon kaa sir kaatna ‘asweekaar’ or ‘atyant akshamya’ he or yadi uksaaya gaya to sainik tatkaal, aakraamak rup se pratikriya karenge
 The comments hina sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke ek vishesh satr main shaamil hone ke liye neuyork main hai, jiskaa pakistan janvari maheene ke liye adhyaksh he

 The deep friendship between Pakistan and China is well known
 donon mulk is dosti ko bharat ke khilaaf enesji se lekar tamaam manchon par nibhaate aae hai
 The china-pakistan Economic Corridor is considered to be the next step of this friendship
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is project par mandaraate khatre ko dekhte hue pakistan ne har chini naagarik kii suraksha ke liye do jawan tainaat kiye hai
 Pakistan has engaged about 15,000 soldiers on duty for about 7000 Chinese citizens associated with the project
 pakistan main coridor project ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kai hamale ho chuke hai
 That is why 14,503 jawans have been deployed from Pakistan to protect 7,036 Chinese employees working in this area
 sipiisi main kaam karne vaale adhiktar chini naagarik punjab praant main niyukt hai
 It is believed that the area of the jihadi groups is stronger in this area
 is babat ek likhit javabpakistanki neshnal assembly main diya gaya he
 The assembly was told that 6364 personnel were deployed in Punjab for the protection of 7036 citizens of China, while 3134 were deployed in Balochistan, 2654 in Sindh, 1912 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area and 439 in Islamabad for security of Chinese citizens
 
 yah likhit jaankaree pakistan piples party kii shahida rahamaan ke sawaal ke jawaab main di gai
 Baloch nationalists are protesting that it is said that the biggest threat to this corridor is from Baloch nationalists
 jabaki isse pehle taliban ke samarthak ladaake bhi pakistan main kaam karne vaale chini nagarikon par hamalaa kar chuke hai
 2000 km ke vistaar vaale sipiisi ko pakistan kii aarthik tarakkee main bada kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Through this, the Guader port in Balochistan can be directly connected to Kashgar in China
 aath projects baluchistan ilaake mempakistan ke liye ranneetik taur par bhi yah coridor mahatvapurn he
 The project's Baz Karakoram highway will once again be connected to the gilgit-baltistan region
 iskaa sidhaa phayda china ko bhi milegaa, kyonki china ke liye pakistan adhikrut kashmir tak pahunchane ke liye rasta mil sakegaa
 Only eight of the cpec's 330 projects are in Balochistan, where separatists are opposing it
 bharat ne coridor ko bataaya avaidhdusri ore, bharat pioke main bharat ke rastechin-paak iconomic coridorka virodh kar chukaa he
 Recently, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Vikas Swaroop called it illegal and said that it is naturally a matter of concern for India
 unhone kaha ki agar baluchistanam main maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan hoga to ham us par chintaa jaahir karenge
 The real intervention is to spread terror from across the border

 ho saktaa he unhen anoushka kii daant khaani pade
 Although such occasions rarely come when Anushka Sharma is seen talking openly about Virat Kohli, but Virat is exactly the opposite
 wo anoushka ke saath tasviren bhi aplod karte hai or unke bare main apni feelings share karne se bhi peeche nahin hatate
 When he met Aamir during the shooting of a chat show in Delhi last evening, he still spoke openly to the questions related to him without hesitation

 This can be bad news for aircraft passengers
 gharelu vimaanan companiyon ke prastaav ko maan liya gaya to yatriyon ko ‘chack in’ saamaan par bhi shulk dena padegaa
 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is considering a proposal from domestic aviation companies in this regard
 iske tahat hawaii yatriyon ko apane saath le jaae ja rahe har kilo saamaan ke liye shulk dena hoga
 However, under this proposal, incentives can be given on the basis of fare for those passengers who will have the least baggage
 dijisie ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya kimahanideshaalay kois bare main spicejet, indigo or airesia se haal hi main prastaav mili the
 These companies have envisaged to have 'zero Baggage Fair' (fare for luggage) category in which ticket fare will be exempted for a passenger who does not have any 'check-in' baggage
 ye suvidha ho sakati he khatmahaalanki anya vimaanan companiyaan bhi is vichaar se sahmati rakhti hai
 In such a system, the existing system of passenger baggage will be abolished, in which the passenger is allowed to carry up to 15 kg of check-in luggage free
 yani yatriyon ko apane saath le jaae jane vaale har kilo saamaan ke liye shulk dena hoga
 In April this year, the DGCA allowed companies to levy a separate fee for seats, food facilities etc

 The best thing about 'team Democracy' is that you will read only the stories of 11 players, but along with those 11 players, you will definitely read one story about all the Test cricketers contemporary to them

 Amid the ongoing dispute over the india-china border, Chinese state-owned media have begun to lay the ground for their country's claim on 1600 kilometers of Indian land
 donon padosi deshon ke bich ansulajhe seemaa mudde par dashakon se jari vichaar-vimarsh ke bich sarkari swaamitv vaali samvaad samiti shinhua or sattarudh china kii communist party ke mukhpatr pipuls daily dwaara prakashit angreji samachaarpatr ‘global times’ ne bharat china seemaa ko kareeb 2000 kilometre lanbaa bataaya he
 The news of the length of the border came in China's official media ahead of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's visit to India from December 15 to 17
 wain ke nai dilli pahunchane se ek din pehle shinhua ne kaha tha ki seemaa kii lambaai kareeb 2000 kimi he
 China's claim is against Indian figures
 bharat kaa kahana he ki donon deshon ke bich kareeb 3500 kimi kii prabhavi (aaparational) seemaa he
 In an interview to Global Times, Ambassador s Jaishankar once again clarified India's position
 seemaa par kathith tanaav ke bare main puche jane par jaishankar ne kaha, ‘seemaa kii sthiti ko chintajtak dhang se pesh kiye jane ke bajaay bharat or china main vaastaviktaa bilkul vipareet he
 We have a 3488 km long shared border
 ’global times ne mangalvaar ko chaape jaishankar ke saakshaatkaar main ek tippanee bhi chhaapi he
 The comment states that the Chinese government often describes the length of the border as 2000 km long
 jaishankar wain kii bharat yatra ke baad aaj nai dilli se beijing laut gayi
 Wen moved to Pakistan in the second leg of his South Asian tour from where he would return to Beijing

 Taking a sharp dig at the Indian media for negatively presenting the results of his talks with the Indian leadership, Wen said it was hurting bilateral relations
 wain ne pakistan ravaanaa hone se purv sampadakon or vidwaanon ke ek samooh ke saath baatcheet main kaha tha ki unka maananaa he ki bharat main press ko swatantraaa he lekin use mitrataa ko protsaahan dene kii bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 He had said that even then the border issue was sensitized many times by the media due to which the leaders of both countries have to compensate for the loss

 In April 2012, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced a grant of Rs 2000 to each Imam
 baad main unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki muajjinon ko bhi 1000 rupee milenge
 State BJP general secretary Aseem Sarkar challenged this decision of the government
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat ek dharmanirpeksh desh he or yah bhatta dharmik aadhaar par samanta sunishchit karne ke praavdhaanon ke khilaaf he
 Kaushik Chandra, a lawyer for the Aseem government, said that it is not even in the public interest as it will cost the government exchequer Rs 126 crore every year
 rajya sarkaar ke vakil ne daawa kiya ki vidhansabha ne is vyay par sahmati de di he or sarkaar kanoon ke daayre main rahete hue hi aisa kar rahi he

 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 se pehle bhaajapa or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne dalit samudaay main paith banane kii bade paimaane par koshish kii thi
 The party was largely successful in this and according to BJP, in that election it also got 34 per cent votes of the Dalit community in the Hindi belt
 iske baad lagbhag 2 saal tak sangh or bhaajapa dalit samudaay main apni pakad banane main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi rahe
 Although the BJP has made inroads into the Dalits, but the process of weakening its grip started in January 2016 with the Rohit Vemula episode
 iske baad july 2016 ke duusare saptaah main jab oona main tathakthith gau-rakshakon ne ek daliton parivaar ke sadasyon par atyaachaar kiye or rajya kii bhaajapa sarkaar is rokane main naakaam rahi usase daliton kaa moh bhang bhagava brigade se hona shuru hua
 The recent issue has arisen regarding the Supreme Court's decision on the provision of immediate arrest in the SC-ST Act
 is samudaay ke logon main bade paimaane naaraazgi he or baikfoot par ai centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ne adaalat main punarvichaar yachika daayar kiya he
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says, "the government will protect the interests of the people of this community at all costs and every effort is being made to protect the interests of the people of this community
" ''jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhaajapa kii chintaa is samudaay ke logon ke hiton se adhik apana vot bank sadhana he
 According to the BJP in the last Lok Sabha elections, it got 24 percent Dalit votes according to the BJP
 uttar pradesh main to daliton ke liye arakshit sabhi 17 siten bhaajapa ke khate main ai thi
 The BJP worked hard before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to connect the Dalits with them
 dilli main bhaajapa ke mukhar virdohi rahe udit raaj ko party ne bhaajapa kaa ummidavaar banaaya tha
 Ram Vilas Paswan in Bihar and Ramdas Athawale in Maharashtra
 tamilnadu main vijayakaanth kii party ko bhi isi makasad se bhaajapa ne joda tha
 After the decision of the Supreme Court, now the voices of these parties have started coming up
 saath hi bhaajapa ke dalit saansad bhi iske liye aawaaj uthaane lage hai
 The BJP does not currently have a solution to address these people
 haalanki adaalat main punarvichaar yachika ke naam par bhaajapa ne khanaapurti kii koshish kii he lekin party ke dalit saansad or sahyogi dal sarkaar par yah dabaav bana rahe hai ki punarvichaar yachika se kaam nahin chalegaa balki sarkaar samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak lekar aae taaki dalit samudaay ke logon kaa bharosa kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 The bjp's dilemma, however, is that if the party is seen going beyond Dalits to a certain extent, the vote bank of the forward and backward castes will slip

 Silver fell by Rs 15 to Rs 34,000 per kg due to weak offtake by industrial units and coin makers
 bazaar sutron ne kaha ki maujuuda bhav parthok or khudara aabhushan kaarobaariyonki ore se sone kii maang kamjor rahane se sona-chaandi kii keemton main giravat ai
 This decline was somewhat limited due to the strength abroad

 Sona 99 in the national capital

 The 5 per cent purity declined by Rs 165-165 to Rs 26,385 and Rs 26,235 per 10 grams, respectively
 tamaam lokapriyata ke baavjood modi sarkaar ke liye kisaanon ko yah samaj paanaa shaayad sabase mushkil hoga ki jameen kaa adhigrahan tarksangat he, thik usee tarah jaise congress sarkaar niveshkon ko samajhane main naakaam rahi thi ki vah aarthik sudhaaron kii raah par aage bad rahi he
 The land is going to test the political skills of Prime Minister Narendra Modi the most rigorously
 bhoomi adhigrahan ko udaar karne ke saath jameen, gaanv, kisaan, kheti or swayamsevi sanghathan rajnatik bahason ke centre main waapas laut rahe hai, jo bijepi ke haai-profile chunavi vimarsh se baahar the
 Ordinary changes in the law are bold but it was better to start with consent, because sensitivity to land is at its peak
 bhoomi kii jamkhori va manamaane kabje maahaul bigaad chuke hai or lagbhag har rajya bhoomi adhigrahan vivaadon kii barudi surangon par baitha he
 Luck is not with the government while liberalizing this sensitive law
 deshi va videshi maahaul main badlaav se kheti ke achche din kamjor pad rahe hai
 Between 2008 and 2014, the support price of crops increased by 130 per cent as compared to only 30 per cent in the previous eight years
 2009 se 2013 ke bich sarkaar ne bafer stock kii jarurat se doguna-tiguna anaaj kharid daalaa
 Such an increase in support prices and heavy government procurement of food grains was not rational
 lekin isse bazaar kheti mafik ho gaya
 The Modi government, after coming to power, limited states' rights in fixing bonuses on the support price
 yah pabandi bhi vyaavhaarik thi lekin bijepi ke bheetar or sansad main bhi iskaa virodh hua he
 Despite the average growth of four per cent in agriculture in the last decade, the arithmetic of inflation in food products from 2009 to 2014 was in favor of agriculture
 krishi utpaadon kaa global bazaar badaae se 2010 se 2013 ke bich bharat kaa krishi niryaat bhi tiguna ho gaya
 The latest report of the National Sample Survey states that agricultural wages have increased at the rate of six per cent (excluding inflation) annually, the highest in the past decade due to better spending on better farming and rural employment guarantee
 haalanki survey yah bhi bataata he ki kheti ke liye sabase achche dashak ke dauraan kareeb 52 fisadi kisaan karj main dab gaye
 The moneylenders account for 26% of the outstanding debt on them
 khaadya utpaadon kii keemten ghatane, samarthan mulyon main badhat par roak or cammdity ke global bazaar main giravat ke bich maahaul, ab, kheti ke khilaaf he or kisaan aatmahatyaayein ise or pechida bana rahi hai
 Therefore, sensitivity to land acquisition is going to increase manifold
 gramin, kisaan or swayamsevi sanghathanon kii raajnneeti ke liye jameen puri tarah taiyaar he kyonki adhyadesh ke baad kai paimaanon par bhoomi adhigrahan kii vyavastha, 2013 ke kanoon se pehle vaali sthiti main hogi
 Where the condition of assessing the impact on livelihoods of landowners' permission or acquisition has been lifted for almost all major constructions, including private-government partnership projects
 is virodh ko thaamne ke liye bijepi kaa rajnatik haath jaraa tang he
 This confusion can also be felt openly by the party mps and the Sangh Parivar, groggily over changes in the Land Acquisition Act
 modi kaa puraa chunaav abhiyaan shaharon se samvaad karata tha, gaanv charchaa main nahin the
 There is little scope for help from the Sangh Parivar because the Swadeshi Jagran Manch was even drafting a strict takeover law from the UPA
 bijepi shaharon kii party he, chahete udyogon ko navajane ke aarope uski peeth par laden hai jo bhoomi adhigrahan ko udaar banane ke tarkon kii chugali khaaenge
 The Congress was in awe of the elections, so it imposed an absurd land acquisition law on the country without consulting all sides, neither benefiting the farmers nor the industries
 thik usee tarah bijepi aarthik sudhaaron par apni saakh bachaane ke liye adhyadesh lekar kud padi he jiske aadhaar par na to adhigrahan hoga or na hi nivesh
 Only after approval and consent from Parliament will the matter proceed
 sarkaar is kanoon main badlaavon par aam raay kii koshish ke jariye sambhavit virodh kii dhar ko kuch kam kar sakati thi
 Interestingly, despite this huge political risk from the government, the industry is not happy as the acquisition conditions for non-infrastructure investment remain the same and most of the investment has to be in manufacturing
 darasal, adhyadesh kaa dambh dikhaakar sarkaar ne bhoomi adhigrahan kii jameen ko or patharilaa kar liya he
 Modi was the head of Gujarat when a notification was issued in September 2012 to create Mandal Becharaji Special Investment Region comprising 44 villages of Surendranagar and Mehsana districts
 ek saal tak chalaa virodh antat: gandhinagar tak pahunchaa or agast 2013 main special investment rigen kaa dayera ghataate hue main 36 gaanvon ko adhigrahan se baahar kiya gaya
 Leaders of Gujarat BJP also believe that for the first time in 12 years, the Modi government had to lay down arms in front of a mass movement
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main badlaav ke saath modi sarkaar, raajnneeti ke mahatvapurn mode par aa khadi hui he
 The balance between the supply of land for development and the protection of land rights is extremely delicate
 modi ko ab na keval sangh parivaar or vipaksh kii bharpoor madad chahie balki vyapak jansamarthan kii bhi jarurat he
 There is no doubt that if Modi can understand the benefits of land acquisition to the farmers, then the success of their success will flow from the fields to the factories
 lekin philhal to bhoomi adhigrahan kii kadical or barudi jameen unki rajnatik dakshata kaa imtihaan lene ko betaab he
 The election season in Bihar is just about to come
 aise main kai netaa tikat ke jugad main khushaamad kii had laangh rahe hai
 At a function in Motihari in the state, several leaders, including former MLC, broke up together to wear shoes to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad
 tasviren dekhakar to aisa hi lag rahaa he, jaise lalu prasad ko khush karne ko koi 'mahamuqabla' chal rahaa ho
 When Lalu agreed to wear a shoe, former MLC Anwar Alam started wearing it himself
 iske baad kai or netaa unhen juuta pehanaane ke liye ghutanon ke bal jhuk gaye
 By the way, there is no answer to the rudeness of the RJD supremo

 This is the whole story- Kothari had taken loans from 7 banks including Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Union Bank of India

 According to sources, PM Modi can make many big announcements with praising the government in his speech and attacking the Congress fiercely
 sutron ke hawaale se jaaniye lalakile se kaisaa ho saktaa he piem modi kaa sambodhan
 
 
 1: There is a big possibility that PM Modi in his address should also introduce the implementation of One Rank One Pension for Ex-servicemen
 is mudde par desh bhar main bhootpurv sainikon kaa andolan chal rahaa he
 2: From the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the country, will loudly describe the achievements of his government for a year, whether it is Jan Dhan Yojana or Pension and Insurance Scheme for the poor
 iske saath hi svachh bharat abhiyaan or beti padhaao beti bachaao abhiyaan piem apni sabhi mahatvakankshi yojanaon ke bare jamkar bolenge
 3: In the address of the Prime Minister, PM will also tell about the action taken by his government on the bureaucrats and other people in the case of corruption in the country
 4:jammu kashmir ke halaat or rajya ke liye aarthik madad kii baat ke saath hi uttar purv ke rajyon ke uthaaye gaye kadam or haal main kiye gaye naga samjhaute kii charchaa bhi karenge

 6: Even though the opposition PM Modi would repeatedly raise questions on his foreign visits, Modi will also talk a lot about his foreign visits in his speech from the Red Fort
 is loksabhaa chunaav main modi ko rokane ke liye jis tarah se vipaksh ekajute hua he uske do pramukh chehre hai or donon hi mahila hai
 Mayawati, the BSP chief in Uttar Pradesh, struck a blow to the BJP by compromising with her staunch anti-socialist party
 ankaganit ke lihaaj se sapa-basapa gathbandhan bhaajapa ke liye uttar pradesh main badi chunautihai
 On the other hand, West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has emerged as a strong voice of opposition
 chunaav adhisuchana jari hone ke saath hi donon kaddavar mahila netriyon ne apana chunavi abhiyaan shuru kiya lekin, chunaav ke aakhri charan main pahunchate-pahunchate mamata banerjee puri vipakshi ekta kii dhuree ban gai hai
 On the whole, Mamta has achieved a stature larger than Mayawati
 philhal mayawati ke mukaable taqatvar dikh rahi mamata banerjee vaastavik rup se kitni damdaar hongi, yah siton kii sankhya main nirbhar he
 Mayawati is contesting on 38 seats, while Mamata Banerjee is contesting on 42 seats
 uttar pradesh main yadi sapa-basapa gathbandhan bhaajapa ko 20 siton tak rokane main safal rahaa to mayawati kaa kad or mahatv achaanak hi mamata se bada ho jayega, kyonki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa jitani kamjor hogi, centre main modi kii dobaaraa vaapasi kii sambhaavna utani hi kam hogi
 Conversely, if the BJP wins more than 40 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the result will weaken Mayawati's stature compared to Mamata
 yadi mamata pashchim bengal main apana purana pradarshan barkaraar rakhti hai (34seat) to unka kad khud-ba-khud badhegaa
 In the last few weeks, the manner in which the entire opposition has shown hope in Mamta is also increasing their stature
 kolkata main amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hui hinsa ke baad jis tarah se puraa vipaksh mamata ke samarthan main khadaa hua usase mamata kii mahatta khud bad gai
 In today's situation, where Mayawati is able to make very little space in the discussion, Mamata Banerjee is in the headlines
 yahi vah pahalu he jisase mamata, maaya ke mukaable adhik taqatvar or prabhavi chhavi ke saath dikhne lagi hai
 The implication is that as the influence of one of these two female women increases, the influence of the other will decrease

 The match between the world's No-1 team India and No-2 South Africa in South Africa is expected to be very exciting and Smith believes that 0-3 defeat in India two seasons ago
 Later the host team will be extra motivated
 smith ne pitiai se kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki dakshin africa kii team kaaphi majboot hogi
 The return of AB de Villiers makes his team look very strong
 gendbaaji bhi kaaphi majboot he
 He has four experienced fast bowlers to choose from and some young fast bowlers as well
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki ve teen tej gendbaajon or ek spinner (keshav maharaj) tathaa chah ballebaajon ke saath utrenge, jabaki quinton dicock saatven number par ballebaaji karenge
 Mithali, Ekta and Harmanpreet were among the icc's best teams of the year
 However, Smith believes that conducting the first Test in a Test series without a practice match could be beneficial for India
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki capatoun main bharat ke paas sarvshereshth mauka hoga
 The movement of the ball in South Africa doesn't bother that much, the challenge it creates is the extra bounce
 main ummid karata hum ki wicket par kaaphi movement nahin hogi or dhimaa oochaal hoga or khel ke aage badhane par spinneron ko kuch madad milegi
 "one of the greatest captains of South Africa, who won the series 1–0 against India on home soil four years ago," said Pretoria (second Test) and Johannesburg (third Test) would be a big challenge for the Indian team
 ’viraat kohli kii aguai vaali bhartiya team behtareen form main he or lagaataar nau siries jeet chuki he
 Most of these victories, however, were achieved in the subcontinent
 bharat ne jab pichhali baar dakshin africa daura kiya tha, to captain kohli, murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaara or ajinkya rahane achche form main the, jabaki rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ko jujhna padaa tha
 Rohit is happy with the victory just before Ritika's Bday, according to WISH Smith, Dhawan and Rohit are now better players, but in front of South Africa's fast bowling attack with players like Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada, Kohli And Pujara will be an important batsman
 unhone kaha, ‘pujaara or kohli mahatvapurn ballebaaj honge
 These two players played well last time so they will be important
 ’umesh yadav, mohammad shami, ishanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar or pehali baar team main jagah banane vaale jasprit bumraah ke tej gendbaaji akraman par smith ne kaha, ‘bharat ko agar safal hona he to unke teen tej gendbaajon ko kaaphi acchhee gendbaaji karne kii jarurat he
 All Indians are talking about fast bowlers
 mujhe lagata he ki antar spel main hoga
 "in India, they throw short spells and try to make an impact, but in the south they have to bear more responsibility under pressure and throw longer spells," he said
 tej gendbaajon ko bharat ko match jitaane honge
 The mindset will be completely different than in the sub-continent and it will have to be seen whether they can handle the responsibility by dealing with it
 ’ Leaders of BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad are worried after the Supreme Court's sword hangs on the neck in the Babri Masjid case
 supreme court ne apane faisle main in netaaon kii musiibat badhaate hue aadesh diya he ki babari masjid giraae jane kii sajeesh main in logon ke upar dobaaraa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 There was an important meeting on Thursday at Murali Manohar Joshi's house in which it was discussed that how to fight this battle further in the court
 murali manohar joshi ke alaava is baithak main sadhvi rutambhraa, vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa chanpatrai or dinesh chandra tyaagi shaamil the
 All these people have come under the purview of the Supreme Court decision
 ghante bhar chali is baithak main in netaaon ne vakeelon ke saath salaah-mashvira kiya ki ab aage kya kiya jaae
 After the meeting, Sadhvi Ritambhara said that they had gathered to consult Murali Manohar Joshi here
 haalanki is baithak main laalkrishna adwani or uma bharti or vinay katiyaar shaamil nahin the
 BJP leaders, including Uma Bharti, have been making statements that it is a matter of pride for them to be associated with the temple movement and they do not care for the outcome
 lekin asaliyat yah he ki supreme court ke faisle ne in netaaon kii musiibat badha di he
 The Supreme Court has not only asked to re-prosecute the case for involvement in the criminal conspiracy to demolish the Babri Masjid, but has also taken all measures to come to an early decision
 pehle is maamle main do mukademe alag-alag lakhanu or raibareli kii court main chal rahe the
 The Supreme Court has ordered that these two lawsuits be clubbed together so that the case can move fast
 nyaayalay ne apane faisle main yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki maamle kii roj-roj sunwaayee hogi
 The witnesses will have to be present on every date and the concerned judge will not be transferred until the hearing is over
 supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki 2 saal ke bheetar is maamle kii sunwaayee puri kar lee jaae
 After the court order, the trouble of the leaders has also increased because now they have to keep a close watch on the hearing in the Lucknow court
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki supreme court ke faisle ke badalaalakrishna adwanike raashtrapati banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko jhatka laga he
 Party leader Sheila Dikshit, who has been criticized for her remarks on Congress vice-president Shahul Gandhi, made it clear on Tuesday that she never doubted Rahul Gandhi's leadership ability
 dilli kii lagaataar teen baar mukhyamantri rah chukin shila dikshit ne kaha, 'maine yah nahin kaha ki party ke sheersh pad ke liye rahul gandhi asweekaarya hai
 Earlier, a section of the media had quoted Sheela quoting that she had questioned the leadership potential of Rahul Gandhi and said that her mother Sonia Gandhi should lead the party
 shila ne kaha ki anya kii tarah vah bhi party kii kaaryakarta hai or party jaisaa kahegi vah vaisaa karengi
 Asked if Rahul Gandhi becomes president, he has a problem
 unhone kaha, 'yah party kaa faisla hoga, jise ham sabko maananaa hoga
 'they said,' Why would we have any problem with anybody
 'haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki sonia gandhi ko party kaa netritv jari rakhana chahie, kyonki vah sabko saath lekar chalati hai

 unhone aage likhaa ki maheenon or saalon tak logon ke bich kaam karne ke baad mujhe aisa lagata he ki mujhe aam janata ke liye bade str par kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Especially after working in UP, it felt that there is much to be done here

 Senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka of Haryana has been transferred once again
 ab tak unka kul 51 baar transfar ho chukaa he
 In a special interview given to Aaj Tak, Khemka has said that it is not so easy to do public service honestly
 khaskar jab nijee swaarth janaseva par baari pad jaae
 Khemakane said that he felt frustrated after the new transfer order, as he had thought to do a lot in his current department
 vah saamaajik suraksha pension ke dhan ke durupyog ko rokna chaahate the, lekin unka transfar kar diya gaya
 Khemkane said that behind his transfers is the politics of personal selfishness
 unhone mana ki haryana sarkaar ke teen kaddavar mantriyon ke saath unki ishyu besd takaraar hui thi, jiske badale haryana kii bhaajapa sarkaar main hi unka paanch baar tabadalaa kiya gaya
 Khekmane said that honesty does not cost anything
 lekin kai baar unako apni bebaaki ke liye pareshaan karne kii koshish kii jaati he
 His 50 transfers are an example of this
 khemkaane robert wadra or sielue maamalon par tippanee karne se gurej kiya or kaha kii sarkaar ko kam se kam dhinagar kamishan kii report ko lagu karke doshiyon ko sajaa deni chahie

 Sidhu was also a lawyer for the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 mritkake paas se mobile phone or anya pahchaan patr baraamad hue hai, lekin mauka-e-vaardaat se goliyon kaa koi khoka nahin mila
 Police are now investigating the call details of the deceased's mobile, which is expected to provide some clues
 police ko shaq he ki is hatya main ek se adhik logon kaa haath ho saktaa he
 Personal enmity is believed to be the reason behind this
 siddhu ko do goliyaan maari gai, jinamein se ek unki chaati or duusari goli chehre ke neeche gardan ke paas lagi
 It is believed that the bullets were fired from two different imported revolvers
 yahi nahin, police kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki hatya kahin or kii gai or laash ko sector-27 main press club ke nikat vaali park main laakar phenk diya gaya
 Money transaction or love affair! Initial investigation revealed that Sukhman Preet Singh Sidhu had taken money from some people
 iske alaava ise prem prasang se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 Police is also interrogating Sidhu's family members and other close relatives including his scribe in the High Court
 siddhu ke ek parijan ne kaha, 'ravivaar shaam kareeb 7 baje ghar se nikalate vakt usne kaha ki vah sector-26 main apane kisi dost se milane ja rahaa he
 After this, his phone started telling him outside the coverage area and then the police called us
 'police ko laash se kareeb 200 meter kii duuri par siddhu kii opetra car (CH04H-0032) bhi mili he, lekin abhi tak koi pukhta suraag haath nahin aayaa he

 5 Director: sajid-farhad Artist: Akshay Kumar, Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh, Boman Irani, Jacqueline Fernandes, Lisa Haydon, Nargis Fakhri and Jackie Shroff Bollywood have forgotten the meaning of laughing
 vah sirf whotsape or soshal media jokes ko aadhaar banakarkamedi filmbanane kii jugat main laga najar aa rahaa he
 Or is he trying to do a comedy that has no connection to the story
 natural kamedi yaa kahani ke mutabik kamedi ab gujarey jamaane kii baat lagane lagi he or kamedi ke sandarbh main yahi baat niraash karne vaali he
 sajid-farhad is a hit couple who write comedy films
 lekin ve antertenment film ke saath diarection main kadam rakh chuke hai
 But his arrival in the direction does not raise much hope
 kahani main kitna damabaman irani kii teen betiyaan haih naragis, jaclin or lija
 Like every father, Baman's dream is to find a suitable groom for his daughters
 teenon ladakiyon ko pasande aate harrkshay, abhishek or ritesh
 But the father of these three girls is not liked
 uske baad pita apane hatkande apanaataa he or betiyaan apane or betiyon ke premi apane
 There is nothing new in the story
 is sab ke bich jaiki shroff kii entry ho jaati he
 Overall, there is a pile of characters in the film, and the attempt to make fun of the mild kind continues
 film main kahani kaa factor puri tarah missing he, or aisa hi lagata he ki sirf jokes dikhaane ke liye hi film banaai gai thi
 The first half is fine but in the second half the film starts to get tired
 phir english jumalon kaa hindi anuwaad, bahut hi kharaab lagata he
 After doing films like Star Appeal, Akshay Kumar, Airlift and Baby, why don't you do such films by messing with your image
 ve ek achche kalakaar he, ve diarector se chahen to story oriented film banavaa sakate hai
 He will say that his acting in this film is good
 ritesh deshmukh is tarah kii filmon ko acchhee tarah nibhaa jate hai, vah unhone bakhubi kiya bhi he
 Abhishek Bachchan disappoints
 unki comic timming film main bilkul bhi mjedaar nahin rahi he
 Then all three girls are just for glamor
 na to unka uccharan acha lagata he or na hi kamedi kii timming hi, diarector ne acting or hindi main kamjor ladakiyon ko kamedi film main kyo liya ye to vahi jaane
 Baman has been seen many times in such characters
 shaayad unhen is tarah ke role pasand hai
 The publicity of the film has been talked about tremendously
 starcast ke naam par dheron sitare hai
 The music of the film is average
 lekin'housephul'ek hit siries he, iske pehle do part ko bhi darshakon ne pasand kiya tha lekin yah part pichhali filmon se thodaa kamjor he
 The film is big-budget, and has a plethora of whatsapp jokes in the name of comedy
 ab ye chutkule or yah majaak darshakon ke gale utar jaataa he to film itihaas doharaa sakati he
 On Saturday, apart from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a road show of Rahul gandhi-akhilesh Yadav also took place in Benares

 Indeed, while worshiping Baba Vishwanath, questions are being raised on Akhilesh's manner of sitting
 soshal media par video viral ho rahaa he, jisamen wo namaaj padhane ke dhang main baithkar puja karte najar aate hai
 Later, when the priest interrupts them, they sit properly
 haar ke dar se hi sahi, akhilesh or rahul mandir to gaye, kuch nayaa siikhaa

 australia ke khilaaf maujuuda test cricket shrinkhalaa main aaj bharat kii museebataan or bad gai jab captain mahendra singh dhoni par perth test main dhimi over gati ke liye ek match kaa pratibandh lagaaya gaya
 Due to this ban, Dhoni will miss the fourth and final Test in Adelaide
 dhoni kii gairmaujuudagi main antim test main bhartiya team kii kaman up captain virendra sahvaag sanbhaalenge jabaki wicketcaping kii jimmedaar riddhimaan saaha ke kandhon par hogi
 The Indian captain was given this punishment because it is his second offense involving over-speed within 12 months
 isisi kii aachaar samhita ke mutabik antarrashtriya team ke captain ko ek match ke liye nilambit kiya ja saktaa he agar uski team 12 maheene ke dauraan ek hi praaroop main over gati ke aparaadh ke liye do baad doshi pai jaae

 ICC Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle was sentenced for being found guilty of throwing two overs less than the target at the end of the match
 isisi ne press vijyapti main kaha, ‘‘dhoni ko agle test ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya he or match fees kaa 40 pratishat jurmaana lagaaya he jabaki anya khilaadiyon par 20 pratishat jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 "this offense rules 2 of the code of conduct
" 5

 New revelation in Kerala serial murder case Bahu gave cyanide 2 to 6 people and was giving cyanide to girls
 The daughter-in-law of Katil Bahu, who is killing six people in 14 years, is constantly telling you the story of the lady cyanide killer
 is dil dahala dene vaale maamle main jaise-jaise police kii tafteesh aage bad rahi he, kahani kaa dayera bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 According to the Kerala Police, Jolly, who had mixed petassium cyanide in the food and gave slow death to six people, had prepared to kill two more
 in donon katl ke liye usne synide kii khuraaq deni bhi shuru kar di thi
 The next two murders were to be of two innocent girls after six murders
 2 maasoom bacchiyon par thi najarkerala kii kosikod police kii poochtacha jaise jaise aage badhati ja rahi he, vaise vaise kerala serial murder cese main nayaa khulaasa hota ja rahaa he
 The next target of this jolly, who was put to sleep by feeding potassium cyanide to 6 in-laws, was 2 more innocent girls from the family
 jinaki parivaar ke mukhiya tom thomas se rishtedaari thi
 And she lives here in this house
 jolly ne un bacchiyon ko khaane main milakar potacium synide kii behad halki dose de bhi di thi
 According to Zaharpulis, mixed in food, these two girls would have the same condition
 jaisaa anamma thomas, tom thomas, roy thomas, mathew manjaadiil, alphine or phili thomas kaa hua tha
 But in time, those girls were taken to the hospital, where their lives could be saved
 parivaaravaalon ne bhi bataaya ki in bacchiyon ko khaanaa khate hi bechaini mahasoos hui or munh se jhaag tak nikal aayaa tha
 Jolly was also present at that time
 kyonki ye khaanaa bhi usee ne taiyaar kiya tha

 rishtedaaron se bhi bayaan liya ja rahaa he, taaki is maamle main bhi jolly par hatya kii koshish kaa maamla darj kiya ja sake
 One of these children is the daughter of Jolly's first husband Roy Thomas's estranged sister
 jabaki duusari bacchee is parivaar ke hi ek rishtedaar kii beti he
 The attempt to give potassium cyanide, the question was why Jolly was targeting those girls like Alfine
 kyon use bacchiyon se nafrat thi
 Actually Jolly used to think that girls become troublesome when they grow up
 police sutron ke mutabik jin bacchiyon ko jolly ne maarane kii koshish kii unki taadaad 2 nahin balki 5 he
 However, the police is currently finding evidence of the family's attempted murder of 2 girls
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki jolly ne apane doston kii bacchiyon ko bhi khaane main potacium synide dene kii koshish kii he
 In 14 years in Kozhikode of Murderkarel of 6 family members, the police have arrested this woman named Jolly Thomas
 isapar ilzaam he ki isane 14 saalon main apane parivaar ke 6 logon ko khaane main potacium synide dekar maar daalaa
 After Jolly's arrest, on October 4, police excavated from the graveyard of the Lourdes Matha Church in Kudathai and extracted dead corpses
 or unhen jaanch ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 Jolly committed these murders from 2002 to 2016
 sabhi ko khaane main potacium synide kii halki maatra dekar maaraa gaya tha taaki ise khaane vaale kii maut fouran naa ho balki dhire-dhire ho or us par koi shaq naa jaae
 Police is investigating from every angle, after the serial killing of the police, the police does not want to leave any angle related to this case
 lihaaza kabr se nikaale gaye kankalon kii forensik jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The Kerala DGP says that the remains can also be sent abroad for investigation if needed
 taaki maut kii sahi vajah kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake

 Sloganeering of some students is not a normal occurrence especially the arrangement of the Prime Minister's meeting is quite sharp
 narebaazi karne vaale chaatro ne bhi jokhim kii parvaah nahin kii
 The Prime Minister gave a non-political speech depicting all aspects of student life as soon as the system was restored
 is vishvavidhyalay kaa mahatv aap is baat se bhi samaj sakate hai ki 10 janvari ko hi yahaan kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani maujuud thi
 As the university was celebrating its twentieth foundation day and the Vice Chancellor recited a poem in praise of the minister
 apane bhaashan ke antim charan main rohit vemula kaa zikr karte hue pradhanmantri bhavuk ho gaye
 Mother Bharti has lost her red and could have said more so that this incident would instill confidence in the angry sections and send a message to all the universities that any kind of negligence will not be tolerated
 lekin pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan samaapt hote hi news channelon par flash hone laga ki maanav sansaadhan mantri ne rohit kii aatmahatya se judi tamaam paristhitiyon or tathyon kii jaanch karne ke liye nyaayik ayog ke gathan kaa faisla kiya he

 The Ministry has taken some steps for all higher educational institutions in the country so that there are no incidents of discrimination against socially and economically weaker students, their issues can be heard from the right platform
 saamaajik, shaikshik or aarthik rup se kamazor chaatro kii samasyaon ke prati samvedanshee banane ke liye ek kaarykram launch kiya jayega
 Under this, people associated with academic administration will be sensitized
 sabhi warden, prashasnic adhikari, register ke liye in kaaryakramon main hissaa lenaa anivaary hoga
 a special module will be made for this
 kamazor chaatro kii shikaayatein lene or karrwai karne ke liye vishesh prakaar kaa system banegaa
 All Vice Chancellors and Senior Administrators will be trained on how to build relationships with socioeconomically and educationally weaker students
 campus main bhedbhaav ko lekar zaraa bhi laaparvaahee bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 a special charter for this is to be issued soon
 pehle bhi adaalaton ne is tarah ke kadam uthaane ke aadesh diye gaye the magar dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 These decisions of the Ministry should send a strong message to all educational institutions in the country
 andhra hoicourt ne bhi aisi paristhitiyon ko rokane keliye 2013 main aadesh diye the ki chaatro ke khilaaf nilamban yaa barkhaastagi kii karrwai kii apil sunne ke liye sabhi vishvavidhyalay main zila jaj ko ambudsman banaaya jaae magar iskaa thik se paalan nahin hua
 Now it has also been decided that a module prepared by IIT Gandhinagar will be implemented in all higher educational institutions of the country
 ise The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL) kaha jaataa he
 Under this, all students who are socially, educationally and economically weak will get a mentor
 ye menter na sirf padhai main madad karenge balki sansthaanon ke bheetar anya maamalon main sahyog karenge

 Under this, senior students are made mentors to cope with the emotional and academic stress and pressure of students of all disciplines

 The story was done by Rohit Bhan because the Union HRD Ministry decided to implement this system for all iits
 isi ko ab sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main lagu kiya jayega
 IIT Gandhinagar pays Rs 125 per hour to senior mentors
 iske kaaran 42 chaatro ke liye 20 senior chaatr menter ke liye aage aae hai
 Another teacher from IIT Delhi has praised this system

 The impact of this incident should be seen in the universities of the country, but there has also been news of appearing from a place

 Jonwal was expelled from the university after being absent for 15 days

 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya he ki jin panktiyon ko kaata gaya he usase zaahir hota he ki rohit jin sanghathanon ke liye kaam karata tha, unhen lekar bhramit tha or unase kuch matbhed the
 The suicide note shows that Rohit has said that ASA and SFI work for their own interest
 police yah bhi jaanch karegi ki rohit kaa pataa lagane main chah ghante kyon lage
 At Wednesday's press conference, Smriti Irani said that the head of the executive committee sub-committee was a Dalit professor
 unke is daawey ko galat bataate hue 14 dalit or anya samudaay ke prophessoron ne apane prashasnic dayitvon se istipha de diya
 There has been no clarification from the Union Ministry of Human Resources on this matter

 Where all the issues will not be openly debated in the university

 esefai ke chaatr bif festival kaa aayojan kar rahe the jiskaa abivipi ne campus main bif khaae jane kaa virodh kiya
 There was fierce fighting and according to Deccan Chronicle, members of ABVP were also hurt

 But as soon as the Prime Minister's speech ended, there was a flash on the news channels that the HR Minister has decided to set up a judicial commission to investigate all the circumstances and facts related to Rohit's suicide
 yah ayog teen maheene main apni report saunpega
 Smriti Irani spoke to Rohit's mother and expressed her condolences
 saamaajik or aarthik rup se kamazor chaatro ke saath ab bhedbhaav kii ghatnaayen na hon, unke muddon kii thik manch se sunwaayee ho sake iske liye mantralay ne desh ke sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon ke liye kuch kadam uthaae hai
 a program will be launched to sensitize socially, educationally and economically weaker students
 iske tahat academik prashasan se jude vyaktiyon ko samvedansheel banaaya jayega
 It will be mandatory for all the warden, administrative officer, registrar to participate in these programs
 iske liye ek vishesh madul banaaya jayega
 a special type of system will be created to take complaints and action of weak students
 sabhi vaais chancelar or varisht prashaskon ko training di jaaegi ki ve saamaajik aarthik or shaikshik rup se kamazor chaatro se rishta kaise banaae
 No negligence on campus will be tolerated at all
 iske liye ek vishesh charter yani ghoshnaptr jaldi hi jari kiya jane vaala he
 In the past, the courts had given orders to take such steps but ignored
 mantralay ke in faislon se desh ke sabhi shikshan sansthaanon ko kadaa sandesh janaa chahie
 The Andhra High Court had also ordered in 2013 to prevent the circumstances that the district judge should be made Ambudasman in all the universities to hear the appeal for suspension or dismissal action against the students but this was not followed properly
 ab yah bhi faisla hua he ki desh ke sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main iaiti gandhinagar ke taiyaar kiye hue ek madul ko lagu kiya jayega
 This is called The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL)
 iske tahat saamaajik, shaikshik or aarthik rup se kamazor sabhi chaatro ko ek menter milegaa
 These mentors will not only help in studies but will also cooperate in other matters within the institutes

 Rohit has stated that the module of The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL) was prepared in 2012 by Prof Kabir Jasuja

 After the court's intervention, an FIR has been registered against the Vice Chancellor of Rajasthan Central University in Ajmer on Thursday
 isamen chah anya prophessoron ke bhi naam hai
 All of them have been accused by phd student Umesh Jonwal that guide Ullas Jadhav harassed VC and got him out of the university
 pichley oktober main jab jonwal ne shikaayat kii thi tab police ne exiaar bhi nahin kii thi
 It is recorded after a court order on Thursday
 jonwal ko 15 din tak anupasthit rahane ke kaaran vishvavidhyalay se nikaal diya gaya tha
 The steps that Smriti Irani has taken will also ensure that there will not be political interference in them

 Rohit's suicide note has been cut in many places
 us par rohit ne likhaa he ki ye line unhone khud kaati he phir bhi inaki forencik jaanch karai jaaegi
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir has said that the lines that have been cut indicate that Rohit was confused about the organizations he worked for and had some differences
 suicide note se aisa zaahir hota he ki rohit ne kaha he ki eyese or esefai apane hit ke liye hi kaam karte hai
 The police will also investigate why it took six hours to locate Rohit
 buudhvaar kii press conference main smriti irani ne kaha tha ki kaaryakari parishad kii up samiti ke mukhiya dalit professor the
 14 Dalits and other community professors resigned their administrative responsibilities, denying their claim as false

 We want to talk on the dwindling space of student politics on campus today, even more than that
 agar vishvavidhyalay main tamaam muddon par khulkar bahes nahin hogi to kahaan hogi
 Why does it happen that Ramdev is not allowed to come to JNU and Siddharth Varadarajan is not allowed to speak at Allahabad University because ABVP feels that his views are anti-national
 siddharth varadarajan rozaana tivi par bijepi ke netaaon ke bagal main baithkar bahes karte nazar aate hai
 His articles are published everywhere
 lekin akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke chaatro ne bolne nahin diya
 Similarly, JNU Students' Union declares that Ramdev will not be allowed to come here
 jeenyu chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh AISF ke hai
 Ramdev is seen giving speeches throughout the day on TV channels and in his yoga camps
 unhen jeenyu main kyon nahin suna ja saktaa
 It is another matter that Ramdev did not go to JNU for his own reasons later but he was opposed
