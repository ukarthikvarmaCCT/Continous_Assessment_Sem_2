 In the opinion of legal experts, asking for permission from the BCCI to celebrate Model Poonam Pandey naked after the Indian cricket team won the World Cup is nothing more than misleading people
 saarvajanik sthal par kapade utarkar jashn manaanaa ashleelata kii shrenee main aata he, jo aparaadh he or bisisiai yaa anya vyakti ko aparaadh ke liye anumati dene kii ijaajat nahin he
 Before the World Cup final, Poonam had said that she would undress and celebrate Team India's victory and she still stands by this statement
 yah model saath hi kah rahi he ki vah aisa karne ke liye bisisiai se anumati kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 He says that he is ready to fulfill his promise at the stadium, the players' dressing room or anywhere else
 kanoonee visheshgy or ucchtam nyaayalay ke adhivaktaa doctor vijendra mahandiyaan kaa kahana he ki punam kaa yah kahana ki vah apane krity ke liye anumati kaa intjaar kar rahi hai
 It is nothing but misleading people
 mahandiyaan ne bataaya, kapade utarkar jashn manaanaa bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 294 (saarvajanik sthal par ashleel krity karnaa) ke tahat aparaadh kii shrenee main aa saktaa he or koi kisi duusare ko aparaadh karne kii anumati nahin de saktaa, chaahe vah bisisiai ho yaa koi or
 As per Section 294 of the IPC, spreading of obscenity in a public place can be punishable by a maximum of three months of imprisonment or fine or both
 mahandiyaan ne kaha, punam kaa iraadaa or bayaan donon logon ko ashleelata ke liye uksaa sakate hai, jo bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat aparaadh he
 According to reports, though Poonam has once written a letter to the BCCI to fulfill her promise, the cricket board rejected her demand
 vah ab bhi bisisiai se anumati kii intjaar kar rahi hai
 Jagdeep Dhankhar, a former Union Minister and a lawyer, says that it is not within the jurisdiction of the BCCI to allow any crime
 unhone kaha, bisisiai yaa koi bhi aparaadh kii anumati nahin de saktaa, kyonki koi bhi kanoon se badhkar nahin he
 If this happens, the police administration can take action by taking cognizance of it
 dhankhad ne kaha, aise bayaan dena yaa yah kaam karnaa saamaajik rup se to galat he or kisi ko bhi aise bayaan nahin dene chahie
 Another law expert Kamlesh Jain says that Poonam's statements fall under the category of provocative and any person can file a complaint against it
 kamalesh ne kaha, bhadakaau bayaan dene kii anumati kisi ko nahin he
 Any person can file a complaint with the police for this and in such a situation Poonam may have to bail, because it is a bailable offense
 unhone kaha, is tarah ke bayanon ko halke main nahin liya ja saktaa, kyonki yuva peedhee par iskaa sidhaa asar ho saktaa he
 They may think that this is the right way to gain popularity and work

 "they explain how the grids that prevent infiltration have been strengthened and monitoring has been increased in places where there is a greater chance of infiltration
" agar yah grid majboot bana rahaa to sena ko lagata he ki vah ghati ke jariye aatankiyon kii awajahi ko roak sakati he or aatanki sanghathanon kii ghuspaith kii koshishon par puri tarah roak laga sakati he
 Estimates from the Intelligence Bureau show that there are now less than 150 terrorists in the Valley, compared to 1,500 terrorists a decade ago
 lekin chintaa kii baat yah he ki ye aatanki zyaadaatar sthaneey yuvak hai
 The army believes that the main reason for the recruitment of local youths is that the terrorist organizations want to increase the dwindling number of militants in the valley
 sachaai kahin zyada jatil he
 According to political analysts, the real reason for this is the growing discontent and hopelessness among the youth, which is gradually increasing in Kashmir
 central uniwarsity of kashmir main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor nur ahamed baba kehete hai, ''pakistan ke saath shanti kii koshishen ruk gai hai, yahaan kisi tarah kii aarthik gatividhi bhi nahin dikhaai detii he, yuvakon ke liye kahin koi naukari nahin he or sarkaar janata ke saath samvaad karne main vifal rahi he
 Unemployment is a major issue, which is promoting discontent among the youth of the valley
 ghati main kareeb 40 fisadi log 15 se 30 saal ke hai
 The relief that came after the severe floods of 2014 is also insufficient
 yah bhi logon kii naaraazgi or niraashaa kii badi vajah he
 The seeds of dissatisfaction were sown during the controversy surrounding the transfer of Amarnath land in 2008
 usase paidaa asantosh 2010 main police par patharbaji karti baari bheed ke rup main dekhne ko mila
 At that time 112 Kashmiri people were killed in police firing
 police adhikari bataate hai, ''2008 se pehle kulgaam main aatankwaad kaa namonishaan nahin tha
 The situation was getting better
 phir aatankwaad ke daur main pahunch gaye hai
 There are 10 terrorists in the area - six Hizbul and four Lashkar
 ''jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla sthaneey aatankiyon kii badhati sankhya ke liye bijepi or piples democratic party (pidipi) ke gathbandhan ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 He told reporters on July 29, "there are reports that educated youth are becoming terrorists and this is a dangerous trend
" isaki sari jimmedaari maujuuda sarkaar par he
 They should not hide the truth
 '' pidipi ke pravaktaa naeem akhtar javaabi hamalaa karte hue kehete hai ki zyaadaatar yuva pichley saal tab aatankwaadi bane the, jab umr abdulla ke netritv main neshnal conference kii sarkaar thi
 Amid accusations against each other, the biggest reason for increasing terrorism is ignored, and that is online Islamic propaganda
 police ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''internet choubison ghante chalate rahane vaale nal kii tarah he, jiske jariye lagaataar islamic prachaar kiya jaataa he
 We have no control over it
 ye ladke apane phone par dabik (islamic state kii patrika) or alqaida kii insapire padhate rahete hai or swayan hi aatankwaad kii ore aakarshith ho jate hai
 "recently, the Jammu and Kashmir Police investigated the cases of 111 youths who had run away from home to join terrorist organizations this year
" unamem se aadhe yuva aise the, jo internet par islamic prachaar kii vajah se aatankwaad kii taraf bade the
 Burhan's 53-year-old father Muzaffar Ahmad Wani, who is the principal at the government-run Higher Secondary School in Tral, recalls how his son ran away from home
 tab vah sirf 14 saal kaa tha
 At that time, his tenth exam was just a week away
 2010 main ek checkpost par police kii pitayee kii vajah se uske man main suraksha balon ke khilaaf nafrat paidaa ho gai
 He explains the reason for being attracted to terrorism, "some of the suicide boys are not able to tolerate police beatings and torture and become terrorists
" ''is saal 13 april ko sena ne traal main hui ek muthbhed main burhan ke bade bhai khalid ko maar giraaya
 Police say 25-year-old Khalid was an outside support worker and was taking three boys to join Burhan to make them terrorists
 sena ne unke chhipane kii jagah ko gher liya to sabhi aatanki bhaag gaye or khalid maaraa gaya
 Vani is not at all distracted by the idea that his second son can also be shot
 ve kehete hai, ''vah insaaf kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 He is wandering with his life in his hand
 ''kulgaam ke kareeb camoh gaanv kii rahane vaali 45 varshiya naseema salaam shaikh apane do manjila makaan ke baraamde main baithkar apane bete tawsiff ahamed shaikh ke saath aakhri mulaakaat ko yaad karti hai
 Tausif, who left his tenth standard, worked as a laborer in an apple orchard in the neighborhood before joining the militant organization
 pichley saal vah yah kahkar ghar chhodkar chalaa gaya ki vah do din ke liye apane kisi rishtedaar se milane ja rahaa he
 He has not returned since
 phir pichley saal ramajaan ke dauraan vah laut aayaa or apni maa ko bataaya ki aakhirkaar use apni jindagi kaa makasad mil gaya he
 He said, "I can't come back
" main yah kaam karke khush hum
 "naseema, whose two brothers became terrorists and was killed in a police encounter, says she is proud of her son," he is following in the way of God
 ''nae ladakon ko pakistan adhikrut kashmir main lashkar-e-tayba kii ore se di ja rahi chaar maheene kii training daura-e-aam or daura-e-khaas kaa phayda nahin mil paata he, jisamen aise aatanki taiyaar kiye jate hai jinhone 27 july ko punjab ke gurdaspur main hamale ko anjaam diya
 They overcome this lack of training with deception and local knowledge
 ve jangalon main rahete hai or kabhi-kabhi khud se sahanubhuti rakhane waalon ke gharon main bhi panaah lete hai
 They use chatting tools downloaded from the Internet to protect themselves from security agencies
 ve sena or police se do kadam aage rahane ke liye udhaar main liye gaye handseton kaa istemaal karte hai
 If this new upsurge is not taking a wide form, the biggest reason for this is that close surveillance of the arms line has been curbed to a great extent by strict surveillance along the Line of Control
 eke-47 riflon kii aapurti main is kadar kami aa gai he ki nae aatankiyon ko suraksha balon se unke hathiyaar chhinane pad rahe hai
 The supply of ammunition has also become a huge problem, due to which the militants cannot carry out long-term firing
 unka jor khud ko bachaae rahane par maaloom hota he—sena kii vardi pahanane ke kaaran ve jangalon main aa-ja sakate hai or kisi ko un par shaq nahin ho paata he
 Five school boys from Bandipura went missing from their homes on 5 June
 sthaneey bijli vibhaag main karmchaaree gulam rasul lone, jinka betaa hanaan rasul lone bhaagane vaale ladakon main shaamil tha, kehete hai, ''maine sochaa ki suraksha balon ne unhen agava kar liya he
 "they went to the security forces to find out about their boy
" agle din un ladakon ko niyantran rekha ke paas ek chaowkee par pakadaa gaya
 They wanted to cross the border and go to Pakistan
 spike heirkat rakhane vaala 16 saal kaa hanaan kahata he, ''maine gaja main bacchon par israeli julm ko dekha
 The feeling has come
 '' vah shahar main sena kii ek ikai ke skool main laut aayaa he
 Lt Gen Subrata Saha, general commanding officer of Srinagar-based 15 Corps, says, "religious fanaticism is being used to provoke local boys, but the important thing is that there are many good things to stop it
" '' sena ke adhikari bataate hai ki acchhee baat yah he ki mata-pita apane bacchon ke gaayab hone kii khabar turant sena or police ko dete hai
 According to the security forces, an encouraging thing is that out of the 111 youth leaving the house, 58 boys have returned home
 sirf 36 ladke hi aatanki banane ke liye taiyaar hue, baaki 17 ladakon ke bare main abhi jaankaree nahin mil saki he
 The encounter is kept as the last option and is adopted against Pakistani terrorists
 kai baar iskaa nateeja bahut dukhad hota he
 On 27 January, Colonel M
 en
 Rai was killed by Hizbul Mujahideen militant Abid Khan
 khan ke chachaa ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki ve khan kaa aatmasamarpan kara denge
 The terrorist turned down the offer and attacked the security forces along with another Hizbul militant, Shiraz Dar
 police adhikari bhi maanate hai ki ve aatankwaadiyon ko tabhi goli maarthe hai, jab unke paas koi vikalp nahin rah jaataa
 Observers say that waving Islamic State flags in Srinagar is a sign of deep mentality
 pidipi kii yuva shakha ke netaa vahidurrahman paara kehete hai, ''aatankwaad sirf bharat ke prati virodh ko lekar nahin he, balki yah loktantr ke vichaar ko bhi chunauti detaa he
 The solution is to build the faith of Kashmiri youth in democracy
 '' pidipi ko ummid he ki yah kaam yuvaaon ko chunaavon main utaar kar kiya ja saktaa he
 Prime Minister's proposed relief package for Kashmir, which is around Rs 70,000 crore

 Today we are going to tell you such a reality which will make your hair stand on hearing it
 malda main hinsa kii aag abhi buji bhi nahin thi ki siyasat sulagane lagi
 If someone gave the event a communal color, someone said that tension between BSF and the people took the form of violence
 lekin siyasat ke bich kai sawaal sulag rahe the
 Was the violence in Malda really communal? Or was there violence due to tension between BSF and local people? Where did suddenly a crowd of 1
5 lakh people come from? Why did people take arms to protest on the streets? Did the police know the gathering of 1
5 lakh people? If the police were aware of the mob, then why was there no proper preparation? Why was the state government busy covering the whole matter? Aaj Tak's team came out equipped with intelligence cameras to find answers to all these questions and first arrived at the same police station which was set ablaze by the mob on 3 January
 jile ke adishnal espi abhishek modi thane main hi maujuud the

 ye to ho hi saktaa he
 They say the same when a terrorist attack occurs
 adishnal espi ke mutabik yadi vakt rahete police ko sahi khufia jaankaree mil jaati to shaayad itani badi hinsa nahin hoti
 But on the other hand, according to the DIB, two days before the incident, the police administration was informed that there was going to be a huge crowd in this area
 yahaan badi vaardaat ho sakati he
 The appearance of the Kaliachak police station was changed after the incident, but what happened was very scary
 diibimihir laal laskar se baatcheetreporter-do din pehle in logon ne bataa diya tha ki ham log dharna karaane ja rahe hai
 Its intelligence report was given to the police? Mihir Lal Lask-hoon

 iske liye usne teen kaaran diye the: 2008 main mrit apni daadi ke antim sanskaar main bhaag lenaa, apni maa kii beemaari or apane upekshit vyavsaayik hiton kii dekhbhaal

 dilli ucch nyaayalay ne manu sharma ko ‘behad tej raftaar’ se parole diye jane or unche samparkon vaale doshiyon ke saath tarjihi vyavhaar karne par sarkaar kii khinchaai kii he
 Justice Kailash Gambhir had said that in normal cases the government takes three to six months to decide on the parole application of a convict but in Manu Sharma's case, it disposed of his plea within 20 days

 haalanki is jeet ke liye bijepi ko kaaphi jor aajamaaish kerani padi
 Let us know how BJP President Amit Shah and CM Yogi Adityanath have devised the winning strategy and how it has changed with bjp's counting
 The day of the Rajya Sabha election: Do not vote with two mlas for a few hours from voting in Rajya Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh The SP as well as the BSP suffered a major setback
 elahabaad hoicourt ne basapa vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari ke vot daalane par roak laga di he
 On the other hand, Jail SP MLA Hariom Yadav has also not been allowed to cast his vote
 do vidhayakon ke vot nahin de paane kii surat main vipaksh kii lamabandi ko karaara jhatka laga
 This proved to be a master stroke by the Yogi government
 agar yah 2 vot padate to sapa or bispi aasaani se 2 siten jeet jaati
 Let me tell you that permission was received from the lower court to cast a vote in the Rajya Sabha elections held on Friday
 saath hi mukhtaar ko kal shaam gajipur kii gangster court se bhi vot daalane kii anumati mil gai thi
 But the Allahabad High Court stayed the application of the UP government

 Prisoners have been banned on the grounds of not having the right to vote
 cross votingyah ranneeti bhi bijepi ke paksh main hi gai
 There was an effort from both sides for cross voting
 bijepi ko jhatka bhi laga jab pataa chalaa ki bijepi kii sahyogi party suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke vidhayak kailash nath sonkar ne cross voting kii he
 However, while giving a blow to the SP and BSP, BJP got the votes of sp's Nitin Aggarwal and bsp's Anil Singh in its favor
 vahiin satish mishra ke anusaar bispi ke ek or vidhayak ne bijepi ke paksh main matdaan kiya
 After the election was over, BSP leader Satish Mishra told that the BJP had kidnapped two of his mlas

 Apart from Anil Singh, two more BSP mlas were in touch with BJP
 mukhyamantri awaas par hui vidhayak dal kii baithak main anil singh ko bhi dekha gaya tha
 In such a situation, there was a possibility that cross voting could happen in the elections
 anil singh unnav ke purava vidhansabha se vidhayak hai
 Been close to BJP before also
 bijepi se tikat nahin milane par bispi se chunaav lade or jite the
 Applying strength to the 9th candidate, the BJP knew that 8 of his candidates would win easily
 yahi vajah thi ki usne sari takat apane antim ummidavaar anil agarwal ke liye jhonk di
 The BJP had decided to send Anil Aggarwal as the 9th candidate to the Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ne apane mul votbank vaisya samudaay kaa dhyaan rakhte hue agarwal ko party ne ummidavaar banaaya tha

 Rajbhar also agreed after meeting Amit Shah
 iske saath hi yogi ne nirdaliyon ko bhi saadhane kaa kaam kiya
 Because of this, the vote of Independent MLA Aman Mani and Vijay Mishra of Nishad Party went in favor of BJP candidate
 yogi kii yahi ranneeti sapa or basapa kii sanyukt ranneeti par baari padi
 Plan b was also ready
 There is not a single time in the day when BJP has failed to make its 9th candidate victorious
 rajyasabha main cross voting par bispi or sapa kii aapatti jataane ke baad bijepi ne apaat baithak bulaai
 Also decided further strategy

 ab har kisi kii najar tiki he uttar pradesh kii varanasi loksabhaa seat par
 This city of Baba Bhole Nath is the most VIP seat in the country as the MP here is Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 2014 main piem modi yahaan jite or ab ek baar phir isi jagah se dobaaraa maidan main hai
 In 2014, when Narendra Modi left Gujarat politics and started doing politics of the country, he chose Kashi for his debut
 kyonki sadhana puure desh ko tha, isliye uske liye uttar pradesh or bihar ko sadhana jaruri tha
 When Modi came to Varanasi, every Modi-ghar ghar modi's slogan in 2014, Modi also said that no one has sent him but mother Ganga has called him
 modi kii ye baat 5 saal unke saath hi rahi
 It was shown last time when Modi nominated Varanasi for the first time, the view was grand
 biechayu se lekar namakan bharne kii jagah tak narendra modi kaa road sho tha or us din maano puri kaashi hi bhagavamay ho gai thi
 Fighting Varanasi does not only mean a seat, but it carries a message to Purvanchal and Bihar
 modi ke us road sho ne tab lahar ko tsunami main badal diya tha, waisi hi koshish is baar bhi bijepi karnaa chaah rahi he
 Narendra Modi has nomination from Kashi on 26 April, in such a preparation is complete
 is baar bhi road sho he, mandir main puja archana he, ganga aarti kaa kaarykram he, matlab najaara puri tarah se bhavy hi rahane vaala he
 Many veterans had come to challenge, if we talk about 2014, then when Narendra Modi decided to fight Kashi, everyone's eyes ran there
 or unke khilaaf ladane waalon kii line lag gai, dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal bhi tab unke khilaaf lade lekin unhen haar kaa saamana hi karnaa padaa
 In the 2014 elections, Modi got more than 5 lakh votes and Arvind Kejriwal, who was second, got about 2 lakh, while Ajay Rai of Congress was in third place
 is baar bhi kai maidan menis baar bhi piem ke khilaaf maidan main utarane vaale kam nahin hai, unke khilaaf is baar purv jaj, tamilnadu ke kisaan ke alaava raajnneetik dalon ke kai pratyaashee maidan main hai
 Even this time Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is in talks to contest elections from Varanasi, meaning the fight will be interesting
 beete 5 saal main piem rahete narendra modi kai baar kaashi gaye, kai videshi mehmaanon ko bhi unhone varanasi kii saiyr karwaai or vishwa patal par kaashi ko pahchaan dilaane kii koshish kii
 Modi says that he has done the task of modernizing Kashi without tearing the heritage, opponents say that Modi has hurt Kashi's cultural heritage
 lekin janata ko kya pasand he, wo to chunaav main hi pataa lagegaa

 Let me tell you, earlier this month, the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover was removed from the Gandhi family and they were given z-plus security
 jed-ples security (z-plus Security) ke tahat 100 surakshakarmi suraksha kii jimmedaari sambhalate hai
 Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the Sri Lankan terrorist group in 1991
 iske baad se hi gandhi parivaar ko kadi suraksha di ja rahi thi
 But according to the perception of the sources of the present government, the Gandhi family is now less threatened and because of this their security has been reduced earlier
 yah bhi padhein:jharkhand vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye congress ne jari kii ummidavaaron kii 5veen soochiab jed-ples security main dilli police ko sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke gharon kaa niyantran saunpa gaya he
 Also, instead of special bullet proof vehicles, the Gandhi family has been given a Tata Safari of 9 years old ie 2010
 isse pehle espiji protection ke dauraan gandhi parivaar kii suraksha kaa jimmaa wo commando sambhalate the jo sabase majboot or smart hote hai or unhen iske liye special training bhi di jaati he
 Also, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi used Range Rover vehicles which were also able to avoid any type of explosions while Rahul Gandhi used a Fortuner car

 reports ke mutabik siarpief ne espiji se gandhi parivaar ko bhi bakhtarband gaadiyaan dene kaa anurodh kiya he lekin ab tak espiji ne isapar koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Angered by the government's move, Congress leaders created a ruckus in Parliament over the matter
 is dauraan neshnal conference ke saansadon ne bhi congress kaa saath diya
 Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary said in the Lok Sabha that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are not normal protectors
 vaajapeyi ji ne bhi gandhi parivaar ko espiji kii protection di thi
 From 1999 to 2019, the Congress government was formed 2 times but SPG cover protection was never removed from the Gandhi family
 aapako bataa den, 1984 main indara gandhi kii hatya ke baad hi espiji banaai gai thi
 It was initially constructed to protect the Prime Ministers of India
 rajeev gandhi ko diya ja rahaa espiji cover unke offis chhodane ke baad hataa diya gaya tha lekin unki hatya ke baad se sonia gandhi or unke bacchon- rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi ko adhik khatra hone ke chalate espiji suraksha di gai thi

 iske baad 1957 main musafirkhaana seat astitv main ai, jo philhal amethi jile kii tehsil he
 Keshakar was also successful in winning from here

 Rananjay Singh was the father of current Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh
 amethi loksabhaa seat 1967 main parisemen ke baad vajood main ai
 Vidyadhar Vajpayee of Congress became the first MP from Amethi
 iske 1971 main bhi unhone jeet hasil kii, lekin 1977 main congress ne sanjay singh ko pratyaashee banaaya, lekin vah jeet nahin sake
 After this, in 1980, Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay Gandhi entered the electoral fray and thus transformed this seat into a Gandhi family seat
 haalanki 1980 main hi unka vimaan durghatana main nidhan ho gaya
 Subsequently, Indira Gandhi's elder son Rajiv Gandhi was elected as an MP from Amethi in the by-election held in 1981
 saal 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue chunaav main rajeev gandhi ek baar phir utre to unke saamne sanjay gandhi kii patni menka gandhi nirdaleey chunaav ladiin lekin unhen mahaj 50 hajaar hi vot mil sake
 While Rajiv Gandhi won by 3 lakh votes

 But he was assassinated before the 1991 results, after which Congress Captain Satish Sharma contested and won the Lok Sabha
 iske baad 1996 main sharma ne jeet hasil kii, lekin 1998 main bijepi ke sanjay singh haathon haar gaye
 When Sonia Gandhi entered politics, she made Amethi her workplace in 1999
 vah is seat se jitkar pehali baar saansad chuni gayi, lekin 2004 ke chunaav main unhone apane bete rahul gandhi ke liye ye seat chhod di

 Kapil said during The Telegraph's fourth Tiger Pataudi Memorial Lecture, "you could have comfortably played 100 Test matches
 aapane yah kahkar ki ‘alavida, maine apana sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya or ab agali peedi ko apana kaam karne do’, jo kiya vah ham nahin kar paae
 That's why i say, 'well done Dhoni, i am convinced of you
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘dhoni aap mahaan ho
 You served the country very well
 unhone acha kaam kiya
 Many are saying that he should have played at least 100 Test matches
 mujhe lagata he ki unhone hamen nayi soch di
 You can't play age
 aapako tab sanyas le lenaa chahie jab aapako lage ki agali peedi aa rahi he
 Kapil quoted Australian veteran Greg Chappell as saying, 'he said one thing that inspired me
 koi bhi cricketer jo apane samay se lambey samay tak kheltaa he vah teen pidiyon ko khatm karata he
 This idea is indeed laudable
 ’ cricket prashaskon kii khinchaai karte hue kapil ne kaha, ‘ummid he ki cricket main prashasan se jude log isse sikh lenge or apni kursiyon par 30 saal yaa taumr tak nahin chipke rahenge
 Kapil also wished Dhoni's team for next year's World Cup in australia-new Zealand
 unhone kaha, ‘main aapako ek or jeet ke liye shubhakamana detaa hum
 Hope you do well
 yah prayek chaar saal main ek baar hota he
 It is painful to wait for the next four years
 ' kapil ne 1983 kii jeet kii yaadon ko taaja karte hue kaha, ‘main bahut garv or khushi mahasoos karata hum ki main 1983 kii team kaa hissaa tha
 Forget the captaincy
 us prakriya kaa hissaa bananaa badi baat he jo hamane apane desh main shuru kii thi
 'he said,' With confidence you can achieve anything in any sport, not just cricket
 hamane khud par vishwaas karnaa shuru kiya ki ham kuch hasil kar sakate hai or 1983 main sabase acchhee baat hui
 My team is also your team
 ’kapil ne iske saath hi bisisiai se lambii avadhi or simit avadhi ke maichon ke liye alag-alag captain niyukt karne kaa aagrah bhi kiya
 He said, 'not every Test player can be a good captain of T20 and every T20 captain cannot be good to lead a Test team
 yah kaaphi mushkil he kyonki test maichon main aapako sochna padataa he
 i hope my country and the cricket board will consider it and have two or three different captains
 isse hamaare khel ko madad milegi
 Kapil said that in future there may be a non-player captain to be appointed
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki aisa samay aayega jabaki gaiyr khilaadi captain rakhaa jayega jo khel kaa behatar tareeke se akalan kar saktaa he
 Technology is changing rapidly

 dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar or aam aadmi party vivaadon se jitna dur bhaagane kii koshish kar rahi he, utana hi usamen fansati ja rahi he
 Now the new case has come out from the Income Tax Department
 vibhaag ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party 2015 main chunaavon ke dauraan mili do karod rupee kaa hisaab dene main naakaam rahi he
 The party has not been able to tell the Income Tax Department where the donation came from
 pichley hafte hi party ko grahamantralay kii ore se videshon se mili chande kii jaankaree dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 Even on this type of order of the Center, 49-year-old Arvind Kejriwal, CM of Delhi Government, said that this is a conspiracy to defame the party
 haal ke dilli main hue emsidi chunaav or isse pehle punjab or goa ke chunaav main mili haar ke baad arvind kejariwal ko party main bhi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The comments sabase pehle, kavi kumaar vishwaas kii taraf se khabaren ai ki vah party se naaraaz hai
 Then he was persuaded
 iske baad saat mantriyon main se ek kapil mishra ko mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne barkhaast kar diya
 The very next day, the minister accused Kejriwal of illegally taking Rs 2 crore from Satyendar Jain
 ab kapil mishra ne maamalon kii shikaayat asibi or sibiai main darj kara di he
 In this whole case, Kejriwal kept silence for a long time, then last night he said that truth will prevail
 centre ke is prakaar ke aadesh par bhi dilli sarkaar ke siem 49 varshiya arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki yah party ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 Arvind Kejriwal is also facing difficulties in the party after the recent MCD elections in Delhi and earlier defeats in Punjab and Goa elections

 bihar police or prashasan kii najaron main aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane vaale logon kii koi keemat or ahmiyat nahin he
 That is why Chief Minister Nitish Kumar takes away the emerald by giving a citation and a mere Rs 3500 to Anurag Basu, who caught two dreaded terrorists
 bihar police bhi ahmedabad serial blast ke mastermind in behad khatarnaak aatankwaadiyon ko pakadvane vaale anuraag ko ratti bhar shrey nahin dena chaahati or isiilie chargeshit main anuraag kaa zikr tak nahin kiya gaya
 Not only this, Anurag told 'aaj Tak' that on the contrary the police keep threatening to trap him in 120 B
 apni jaan daanv par lagaakar 56 logon kii hatya ke mastermind aatankwaadiyon ko pakadvane vaala anuraag ab police ko phooti aankh nahin suha rahaa
 Let me tell you that Anurag, a resident of Gaya, runs a cyber café and is a trend in martial arts
 usne apane sibar cafe par aae do vyaktiyon ko jab apni jaan jokhim main daalkar police ke haathon pakadvaaya tab use shaayad pataa bhi nahin tha ki ve ahmedabad main 2008 main 16 jagahon par 21 serial blast main shaamil rahe durdaant aatankwaadi hai
 Due to Anurag's bravery and alertness, the police not only arrested the dreaded terrorists like Pathan Tausif and Sunny Khan, but based on the inputs from Tausif, he had also helped in capturing 10 dreaded criminals from across the country
 in aparaadhiyon par bhi 10 lakh rupee se adhik kaa inaam ghoshit tha
 Let us tell you that all the intelligence agencies including ATS, NIA were looking for both the dreaded terrorists for the last 10 years, who were arrested on 13 September last year due to Anurag's bravery and alertness
 police ne donon aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf 10 march ko chargeshit daakhil kii he, lekin police kii chargeshit main na to anuraag kaa zikr he or na hi uske sibar cafe kaa jahaan se donon aatankwaadi giraftaar kiye gaye
 In this way, the picture of 10 terrorists released by the Delhi Police was caught somewhere in the mind of Anurag, who was running a cyber café as a terrorist
 13 sitambar, 2017 ko jab donon aatankwaadi uske sibar cafe main aae to unki sandigdh gatividhiyon ne uske man main shankaa paidaa kar di
 Not only did he wisely keep both of them in the cyber café for a long time, but Anurag, who specializes in martial arts, saw that when the police were late and the suspects started fleeing, they took their lives all alone by playing on their lives
 Caught
 yahaan tak ki telugana police anuraag ke sibar cafe ke 4 computaron kii hard discs bhi lekar gai, jiske aadhaar par 4 lakh ke inami abdul subhan kuraishi ko dilli se, 10 lakh ke inami mohammad paigambar shaikh ko siliguri se or 10 lakh ke hi inami mohammad cameruddin ko murshidaabad se giraftaar karne main kamyaabi mili
 Punishment received instead of reward: Anurag should have got the reward of capturing so many dreaded terrorists, but now his livelihood has also got hurt
 jis sibar cafe ke chalate usne donon aatankwaadiyon ko pakadvaaya, ab vah sibar cafe band padaa hua he
 Anurag does not know what to do if he does
 anuraag ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki maine to deshhit main kaam kiya tha
 But now i am in a bad condition
 deshhit main aisa kaam kya karnaa ki apni roji-roti hi band ho jaae
 i don't even have my own house
 kiraye par hi ghar he or dukaan bhi kiraye par hi thi
 The attitude of the police is very bad The attitude of the police towards me has been very bad
 chaahe thana adhyaksh hon yaa DSP
 i was told that if i demand an award or reward, i will be put inside by putting 120 B
 donon aatankwaadiyon ko pakadaney kaa sara shrey police khud lenaa chaahati he
 Anurag says that he is a common citizen, so it is being done to him
 aword yaa reword kii baat to dur chargeshit main meraa zikr tak nahin he
 My statement taken by CGM on 1 February is not even mentioned
 police kaa kahana he ki pakade gaeatankwaadi ke networkamen gaya ke local log bhi invaalve hai
 In this way, i have become a life risk
 main yahaan rahane laayak nahin hum or mere paas itane paise bhi nahin hai ki kisi duusari jagah chalaa jaaun
 Anurag told police that the police was pressurizing him to change his statement
 police ne usase kaha ki vah aisa bayaan na de ki police der se pahunchi
 Simply speaking, holding the terrorist and handover
 police mujhe hi jaan ke khatre kaa bhay dikhaa rahi he
 Now my cyber café business has also closed
 police or aatankwaadiyon ke dar jo log mere yahaan kaam karte the, ve bhi chale gaye
 i also went to his house to work brother, but for fear of terror, he is not working
 customers kaa aana bhi band ho gaya
 Asgaya MP Hari Manjhi also wrote two letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but there was neither any assurance nor action from the Prime Minister
 anuraag ko bhi ab tak uski bahaduree ke liye sahi riward nahin diya gaya
 The DSP of Bihar ATS has filed in the Coachesheet Court on 10 March, there is no mention of Anurag in it
 ajtak ne jab unase is sambandh main poocha to unka kahana he ki chargeshit main isaki jarurat nahin hoti
 But the reality is that awards or rewards are decided on the basis of the charge sheet
 haalanki mjiaar, pradhanmantri or grahamantri kii ore 8 disambar ko letters aayaa tha, jisamen likhaa hua he ki anuraag ko vittiya sahaayta, suraksha evam anya laabh die jaaen
 But Anurag has not received anything from it till now

 agar neerav modi 26 farvari ko idi kii ore se jari tisare saman par bhi hajir nahin hote hai, to un par kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi or unhen 'bhagoda' bhi ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 The ED can also go to the AMLA court for this so that its verdict can be stamped

 com / xechwrfra7 raaj thakare or sharad pavaar kaa bahucharchit intervyuu aakhirkaar ghoshnaa karne ke teen maheene baad hua
 During this interview, NCP chief Sharad Pawar told Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray that the reason for his leaving Congress in 1999 was Sonia Gandhi
 pavaar ne kaha ki sonia tab pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati thim, jabaki tab is pad ke liye daavedaar manmohan singh yaa vah khud the
 He recalled the incident and said, 'I was at home and media reports showed that Sonia Gandhi was going to stake claim to form the government
 piem pad ke liye manmohan singh yaa main uchit daavedaar the
 At the same time, i decided to leave the Congress
 '150 minute chali is mulaakaat main raaj thakare ne sharad pavaar ke 50 saal ke rajkeey, saamaajik, krishi, khel or saanskrithik jivan ke safar ke bare main jaanane kii koshish kii
 By the way, in November 2017, this special conversation was announced by Hanumant Gaikwad, Founder Director of BVG Group
 yah mulaakaat chah janvari ko hone vaali thi, lekin bhima koregaanv hinsa kii vajah se kuch samay ke liye isko radd kar diya gaya tha
 Feeling pressured, Thackeray met the much-talked about BMCC College in Pune
 iskaa aayojan jaagtik marathi academy dwaara kiya gaya
 During this time the topic of 'shodh Marathi Man Ka' was discussed
 raaj thakare kii style or do took baat karne kaa andaaj kaaphi logon ko pasand aayaa
 Youth leader Raj Thackeray held senior leader Sharad Pawar's hand and brought him to the stage
 raaj thakare ne baatcheet kii shuruyaat main hi spasht kar diya ki aaj wo bahut dabaav mahasoos kar rahe hai
 They attributed this to the generation gap
 sach kehane main mushkil to chup rahenraj thakare ne sharad pavaar se poocha ki kya unhen kabhi sach bolne kii vajah se mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa? sharad pavaar ne muskuraate hue jawaab diya ki raajnneeti main sach bolnaa hi padataa he, lekin jahaan bolnaa mushkilen paidaa kar saktaa he, vahaan nahin bolnaa chahie
 Asked about the rift in society, Chintaraj Thackeray asked which question of Maharashtra he feels worried, Pawar said that the rift in social and ethnic solidarity in the state haunts him
 isaki vajah se samaajon ke bich main vidwesh bad rahaa he or ye rajya ke liye thik nahin
 Opinion about Narendra Modi PMM What was Sharad Pawar's opinion about Narendra Modi earlier and now what is his opinion? Sharad Pawar said that he has a good habit of getting up early in the morning, a habit of getting ready and a habit of working very hard
 is jawaab par hansate hue raaj ne kaha ke vah bhi jaldi uthne lage hai, lekin kya aisa karne se koi desh kaa pradhanmantri ban saktaa he?rahul laaenge congress ke achche dinarahul gandhi ke bare main ab sharad pavaar ko kya lagata he? is par sharad pavaar ne jawaab diya ki pehle vaale rahul or abake rahul ke kaamkaaj main bahut fark aayaa he
 If Rahul Gandhi keeps moving forward, the people of the country will definitely accept him and good days will come for the Congress
 desh chalaanaa, gujarat chalaanaa nahinsharad pavaar ne modi dwaara desh ke netritv par sawaal kiya or kaha ki gujarat jaisaa ek rajya chalaanaa or desh chalaane main antar he
 You can know every corner of Gujarat, but when it comes to the country, it is important to have a person who knows every state in your team
 raksha mantri bane to rank nahin pataa thepwar ne ek vakya bataaya ki jab vah desh ke raksha mantri bane to unhen bhartiya sthal sena, vaayu sena or nausena ke afasaron ke rank pataa nahin the
 Without blushing, Pawar told how he learned these nuances from retired officers and moved forward
 jaruri nahin ki har vyakti ko har baat pataa honi chahie, lekin desh chalaanaa he to sabhi baaten seekhney jaruri hai
 He said that Rahul Gandhi is trying to learn new things
 yashavanth raav or bal thakare kii kameepavaar ne kaha ki rajya ke yashavanth raav chavaan ne desh or videsh main maharashtra kii pratishtha badhaai, unki kami khalati he
 Apart from this, Balasaheb Thackeray also seems to be lacking
 daaud par di safaisharad pavaar ne daaud ke maamle par pehali baar safai di
 He said that he faced many allegations, but he does not give any importance to it
 sab kehete hai ki daaud or sharad pavaar ke sambandh he, lekin isamen koi tathy nahin

 mahabali hanuman ko aksar sankatmochan naam se pukaara jaataa he
 But why was Hanuman called Sankatmochan
 iske bare main bahut kam log jaanate hai isliye ham aapako bataaenge hanuman ke sankatmochan kahalaane kaa rahasy
 Sankat kite mite sub pirajo sumire Hanumat Balbeera
 
 
 
 That is, whoever keeps paying attention to Hanuman, the devotee, all his crises are cut off by himself and all the sufferings are destroyed
 puranic manyataon main bajrangbali ko kalyug kaa pratyaksh dev kaha gaya he
 It is also believed that Hanuman got the blessings of being immortal and immortal
 tabhi se mahavir hanuman apane priy bhakton ke sankat harte ke liye prithvi par hi vicharan karte rahete hai
 Perhaps that's why Hanuman ji was called Sankatmochan, so let us know what are the reasons behind the name Sankatmochan of Mahabali Hanuman
 
 
 
 Why is Hanuman ji called Sankatmochan? - Hanuman ji is a devotee of Shri Rama and also the supreme symbol of devotion
 - ramayana main jis kushalta se unhone tamaam samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kiya, vah bina vishesh yogyata ke ho hi nahin saktaa
 - Due to the precise use of time, knowledge, speech and resources, we can call them management gurus
 - saath hi har tarah ke sankat kaa naash chaturaai se karne ke kaaran vah sankatmochan bhi kahe jate hai
 In mythological beliefs, Bajrangbali has been called the direct god of Kali Yuga
 manyata ye bhi he ki hanuman ko ajar-amar hone kaa aashirwad swayan mata sita se mila tha
 Since then Mahavir Hanuman keeps wandering on the earth to overcome the distress of his dear devotees
 shaayad isiilie hanuman ji ko sankatmochan kaha gaya to aaie jaanate hai mahabali hanuman ke sankatmochan naam ke peeche or koun-koun se kaaran hai
 
 
 
 kehete hai ki jivan main sankat kaisaa bhi aae, hanuman ji ke paas uskaa samaadhaan jarur hota he
 There is no such suffering and no such pain on this earth, which Mahavir Hanuman is unable to diagnose, so if there are repeated crises in your life or there are obstacles in completing any work, then Lord Hanuman should be worshiped

 ji haa ham baat kar rahe hai himachal pradesh ke bilaspur kii usee surang kii jisamen pichley nau dinon se teen jindagiyaan fansi thim
 But the operation life is not yet complete because there is still one more life to be saved
 use bhi usee kabr se baahar nikaala janaa baaki he jisamen se baaki do ko somvaar ko jinda baahar nikaal liya gaya
 On September 12, a man trying to get ahead in the race for progress got a shock in the hills of Bilaspur in Kohimachal when three workers were suddenly trapped inside a tunnel of rock and mud in a tunnel in Tehra
 bilaspur main kiratpur-nerchowk forlan haive par panoh ke paas kareeb dedh kilometre lambii surang banane kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 On September 12, around 8:30 pm, the shift of the laborers working in the tunnel under construction was changing
 us vakt tunnel ke andar 16 mazdoor kaam kar rahe the
 13 of these 16 people came out to change the shift, but before the remaining three workers could come out, then suddenly an accident happened inside the tunnel and all the debris fell from the 25 feet high roof of the tunnel and the three workers, Satish Kumar, Mani Ram and Hadi Ram were trapped inside the tunnel
 maut kii syah surang main puure chaar din gujaarne ke baad aakhirkaar beete somvaar ko wo lamhaa aayaa, jab zindagi ne khud ke jinda hone kaa subut diya
 However, one thing which is disturbing amidst this happiness is that one of the three laborers, Hridayaram, is still not known
 bilaspur main pichley 9 dinon se din raat chale is rescue oparation ne beshak do mazdooron ko jinda nikaalane main kamyaabi hasil kar lee ho, lekin tisare majdoor hridyaram ko lekar ab tak koi khabar saamne nahin aa saki he
 It is another matter that before taking out Hridayram, the district administration and NDRF have decided not to stop their operation
 andiaref, sutluj jal vidyut nigam limited, border road orgenigeshan or himachal pradesh power corporation limited ke is joint oparation main exparts ne jeet hasil karne main koi kor-kasar baaki nahin chodi or aakhirkaar isamen jeet bhi hasil hui
 But this effort is incomplete at the time till the arrival of a laborer Hridayram
 maut ko maat dene kii is karishmai khabar ke saath ek ajeeb ittefaq bhi judaa he
 a coincidence that not only gave these two laborers trapped in the dark tunnel to survive in extremely difficult conditions for a full nine days, but also told how the difficulties become smaller in front of rocky intentions
 darasal tunnel main fansaa majdoor satish isse pehle bhi aise hi ek tunnel main naa sirf funs chukaa tha, balki takreeban chah se saat dinon kaa vakt aise hi mushkil halaat main pehle bhi nikaal chukaa tha
 At that time, Satish was a member of a team building a tunnel in Barsnehi area of kullu and even then unfortunately he got trapped in the debris from the tunnel
 lekin usne tab bhi apane chattani hausale kaa subut diya tha or is baar bhi diya
 According to the people involved in this rescue operation, it was only Satish, who not only gave up the courage, but also kept encouraging Maniram who was trapped with him
 
 
 or kahin naa kahin satish ke in buland iraadon ke peeche uskaa pichhlaa tajurba bhi ek ahm vajah sabit hua
 
 
 This is the reason that when the NDRF jawans arrived for the first time on Monday, Satish first let his partner Maniram get out and then came out himself

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the representative body of the business world, on Tuesday presented a proposal for a 10-point agenda for the country's economic development
 siaiai ne vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) ko jald se jald lagu karne kaa prastaav rakhaa or kaha ki isse aarthik vikaas dar main dedh fisadi tak kaa sudhaar ho saktaa he
 The comments siaiai ke rashtriya adhiveshan main pesh prastaav main repo dar main 100 aadhaar ankon kii katautee, nakad arakshit anupaat main katautee, uddyan kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kii upree seemaa ko or upar karne, bahu brands khudara kaarobaar main epadiai kii anumati or mashiinon tathaa sanyantron main nivesh kii avamulyan kii gati ko badhaakar 25 fisadi tak karne jaise anya upaay siaiai ke prastaav main shaamil hai

 There was a strange joy before the arrival of a storm which destroyed the three-decade-old fort of Marxist rule in Bengal
 bengaaliyon main jo bhakpa (em) ke netaa the vahi ise bhaanp nahin sake
 State party president Biman Bose, known for his fiery temperament, was ridiculing "contract media" (ie journalists are part of the crooked bourgeois conspiracy of the us-congress-mamata) even when the results of the election would come
 
 unka is tarah kaa bayaan lokokti main bhi shaleen nishaani nahin tha
 But we should not forget that the person has lost his conscience along with his presence
 haar to kisi kaa bhi santulan bigaad sakati he
 Three decades ago, the CPI (M) was similarly wonderfully ignorant of its victory
 usne immergency ke baad 1977 main morarji desai kii janata party ke saath aam chunaav ladaa tha
 He won 120 out of 294 seats in the Vidhan Sabha elections
 apni jid bhari morrkhtaa main janata party use itani siten bhi nahin dena chaahati thi
 Everyone knows what happened next
 chauntis saal kii safalataa ne communist dhaanche or soch kii kamajoriyon par paradaa daal diya thah party ko hameshaa janata se shreshth mana jane laga tha
 The Janata Party had become a slave to the will
 inaam or sajaa party kaa uphaar tha, kyonki bengal ke kone-kone main uskaa bolbalaa tha
 The party used to give preference to such people who helped it to get a majority, whether it was full of support or rigged
 baaki log kathor shashan ke shikaar bane, jise party or police kii mileebhagat se lagu kiya gaya tha
 Jobs were no longer available, as development was suppressed by a monotonous coalition of parallel bureaucracy, so there was nothing left for "them" in "our" versus "their" Bengal
 'unhen' nirantar daridr hote maahaul main ksht jhelane ke liye chhod diya gaya tha
 The party continued while Bengal was continuously sinking
 mamata kii chunavi safalataa lagaataar fail rahe gusse kaa nateeja he, jise saadhaaran taur par is tarah abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- ab bahut ho chukaa
 But it also includes the fact that the famous CPI (M) cadre had stalled between the 2009 general elections and the subsequent panchayat elections
 kuch mamata ke saath ho gaye the, jabaki apni ankhen khuli rakhane waalon ne molbhav karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The change or poriborton had started appearing long before
 yah doosraa mauka he jab bengal kii janata ne parivartan ke liye vot diya he
 The public first voted for change within the CPI-M when it felt that the new Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya would liberate the lifeless communist from the bond of "ism"
 jab bhattacharya vifal ho gaye to unke khilaaf gussa charam par pahunch gaya
 After Mamta's victory, expectations have increased so much that there will be no option left after her failure
 lekin unhen iskaa pataa he
 We all know that there is courage in them
 lekin kisi ko unke shashan ke rou-ba-rou chunautiyon ko kam karke aankane kii galati nahin kerani chahie
 This time, corruption was the main issue in the elections
 keval dilli is tarah kii baat failaa sakati he ki tamilnadu kaa matadaata itnaa bhrasht he ki bhrashtachar se chintit ho
 Kavral's Chief Minister V
 es
 Achuthanand was able to convince the voters in his state that he challenged not only Delhi but also his party on the issue of corruption
 assam ko chhodkar congress ne har jagah apana janaadhar kho diya (jahaan tarun gogoi ne shanti or vikaas ko vijay main tabdeel kar liya) kyonki centre main uski daagdar sarkaar he
 The election results of West Bengal are no different from this point of view: the voter punished the Left Front for political corruption, which can be as annoying as stealing from the treasury
 yah nishchit taur par kaha jayega ki vamapanthiyon ke hit itane ahm hai ki unheen par chhod die jaaen
 Will the fort which has been demolished in Bengal be helpful in its revival? It is necessary to die once for rebirth and the CPI-M must first accept that they forget their past

 yah bachat hi bainkon ke jariye sarkaar ko karj ke taur par milti he, jisase uskaa kharch chalata he
 Banks in India are sick but never submerged

 The money of the depositors (depositors) is included in this, however the deposit which is kept under insurance will remain out of this process

 The language of this provision is poor, the references are also confused, there is no possibility of it being implemented

 The basic reason for fear is that the use of collective punishment for the economic irregularities of the selected people has started to be too much

 There is a problem of the outstanding banks owing to the big borrowers, but efforts to solve are scaring the common people
 bhartiya banking kii musiibat anokhi he
 The biggest debtors are its crisis
 kuch kaarobaari galatiyon ke maare hai, kuch ne jaan-boojhkar bainkon ko chuunaa lagaaya he or kuch ko mandi le dubi he
 86% of banks' bad loans (GNPA-8)
 29 lakh karod ru
 ) Are the names of big borrowers
 lekin khauf main jamakarta hai jo choti bachaton (150 lakh karod ru
 ) Form the financial backbone of the country
 bainkon ko ubaarane ke liye do hi vikalp hai: ek yaa to karadaataaon kaa paisa lagaakar bainkon ko ubaara (bajet se bainkon ko puunji dena yani bel out) jaae yaa jamakartaon waalon kii bachat se nuksaan bharaa jaae
 The 'bail-in' provision suggests that it is wrong for banks to recover from the budget
 bainkon se kaarobaar (nivesh yaa jamaa) karne waalon ko yah boj uthaanaa chahie yani ki churi kisi tarah se gire katenge aam log hi
 Banking dilemma is not treated as 'bell in', 'bail out' or 'hair cut' (decrease in capital and profits of banks)
 philhal banking paridrishy ko teen bade dhanchaagat sudhaar chahie
 25 years have passed since liberalization
 pariyejnaaon ke vitt poshan kaa dhaancha badalanaa chahie
 It is necessary to reduce dependence on bank loans for large projects
 companiyon ko apni saakh par bazaar puunji va karj uthaanaa chahie
 Small consumer loans are better for banks, which do not have problems with recovery

 bainkon ko sansadhano ke gaiyr diposit strot badhaane honge
 Until the last century, most of the resources of banks in America came from deposits
 kramshah bainkon ne fedral rigerv se karj or puunji va bond bazaar ke jariye sansaadhan sangrah badhanaa prarambh kiya
 Now half the resources are non-deposits
 isse bank sansadhano kii laagat bhi kam hui he, jamakartaon ke liye jokhim ghate hai
 Depositors should get better insurance cover which can be borne by them

 There is also a meaning of bank which is not like this
 kisi arthvyavastha main bank logon ke bharose kaa pehla va aakhri aadhaar hai
 The banking pattern is different in every country
 bharat main bainkon par pehla haq karodon jamakartaon kaa he, jinamein adhikansh kabhi karj nahin lete
 Borrowers are an essential part of banking but are small
 agar sarkaar chaahati he ki adhik se adhik log bainkon se juden yaa jude rahen to use aisa kuch nahin karnaa hoga jo bharat main bainkon kii buniyaad yani jamakartaon ko ashankit karata ho
 Exposure to a limit with banking can be explosive

 Responding to the criticism of some members, he said that due to the global situation, some immediate steps had to be taken and in such a situation, this ordinance had to be brought

 With BS Yeddyurappa resigning from the post of Chief Minister in Karnataka, the deadlock over the search for his successor remains, with the bjp's power struggle starting

 The anti-yeddyurappa side is supporting Jagdish Shettar for the post of Chief Minister
 shetter bhi party ke purv pradesh adhyaksh hai or vah prabhaavshaalee lingayat samudaay ke hai jisase yediurppa aate hai
 But he does not accept Yeddyurappa
 yediurppa ne ravivaar ko apane pad se istipha diya
 However, Yeddyurappa made the decision three days after Lokayukta Santosh Hegde's report on the illegal mining case directed the party's central leadership to resign after he blamed himself
 shetter ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘main daavedaar hum
 'he said,' BJP mlas have expressed the desire that i should become the Chief Minister
 ’ unka bayaan is baat kaa sanket he ki bhaajapa haikaman ke saamne mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi kaa chayan karne kaa ek bahut hi kathin kaary he

 vidhayak dal kii baithak se pehle is baat ko lekar atakalein jari hai ki kis paksh ke paas adhik vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 On being told that Yeddyurappa suggested Gowda's name, Eshwarappa told reporters, "yeddyurappa did not say that he (gowda) had been elected
 ’ishwarappa ne yah kehete hue swayan ke mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he ki party ko majbootee pradaan karne ke liye unhen teen varsh ke liye pradesh ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha or vah is kaarykaal ko puraa karenge
 This statement raised a question mark over the possibility of Yeddyurappa being given this post
 yediurppa kathith rup se is par jor de rahe hai ki unhen party kii pradesh ikai kaa adhyaksh bana diya jaae
 He tried to minimize the differences arising in the selection of Yeddyurappa's successor, saying that the BJP has 121 mlas and there are no differences between them on the issue
 ishwarappa ne kaha, ‘yah nirnay (naye netaa ke chayan) dilli main nahin hoga
 The BJP MLA will sit and select the leader and the party's central leader will remain as the observer

 aarope he ki sanstha ne mantriji ke chunaavashetra vishrampur ke navadih kalam ilaake main jienem kii padhai ke liye indian nursing counsil ko juthi report pesh kii, jiske aadhaar par sanstha ko jienem kii padhai ke liye ijaajat mil gai jabaki hakeekat main us jagah par koi aspataal chal hi nahin rahaa he
 There is a building for the hospital, but there is still a lot of work to do
 palamu jile kaa bishrampur sthit sohari chandravanshi hospital daawey ke mutabik yahan baqayada 100 bistaron valhospatalabite chaar maheene se chal rahaa he
 There are claims to treat patients here too
 aisa hi kuch jile ke tatkaaleen civil sarjan sah district registry athurity kii report bhi kahati he
 Those who had confirmed the report of the institution on 28 April 2016, said that they got all the facilities suitable for running the training college right by physical inspection
 report main kaha gaya he ki aspataal main 100 bed, jaruri upkaran ourdoctorsai
 Based on this report, the Nursing Council gave permission to the hospital to open a college for the year 2016-17
 darasal sanstha ke sachiv ne nursing counsil ko farvari main die apane aavedan main jienem kii padhai ke liye anumati maangi thi jisamen unhone kaha tha ki sanstha ke paas 100 bistaron vaala aspataal he
 Local people are denying that any such hospital exists
 jienem kii padhai ke liye nirdhaarit shartanium ke mutabik jienem kii padhai ke lienirdhaarit shartonmen 100 bistaron kaa aspataal hona jaruri he
 If not, the college can claim this by showing its affiliation to any of the three nearby hospitals
 basharte ye aspataal college se 15 se 30 kilometre kii paridhi main ho
 In mountainous areas this distance can be up to 50 kilometers
 guideline ke mutabik aspataal ke 75 fisadi bed marijon se bhare hone chahie
 These hospitals should have facilities for treatment of ICU, ICCU, Minor or Major Operation Theater, Gynee, Children's wards, Orthopedics, Dental, Neuro and ENT
 jabaki aspataal main aisa kuch bhi nahin paaya gaya
 On the opposition's target, Health Minister Kameshwar Baitha, former MP of Palamu, says that this is sheer forgery
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki is ilaake main aspataal kii sakht zarurat he
 At the same time, the Health Minister says that all is working Ramachandra Chandravanshi Welfare Trust has opened educational institutions at many places in Palamu district
 jinamein shaikshanik, vyavsaayik or takneekee shiksha di jaati he
 Most of these institutes are in the same campus in Vishrampur

 film kaa naam : bazardiarector: gaurav ke chawlaster cast: saf ali khan, chitrangada singh, rohan mehara, radhika aptivadhi: 2 ghanta 20 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 3
 5 Stargaurav's Chawla's name is famous in the advertising industry but for the first time he has ventured into film direction
 share market ke utaar-chadhaav or us duniya ke ird-gird hone vaali baton ko bazaar film ke jariye gaurav ne darshane kii koshish kii he, aaie jaanate hai aakhirkaar kisi bani he yah film
 Story: The film's story begins with Mumbai industrialist Shakun Kothari (saif Ali Khan), who considers himself the king of the stock market
 shakun kii bivi mandira kothaari (chitrangada singh) he
 Traders with Shakun are jealous of him because his way of working is different
 isi bich elahabaad shahar se trading karne vaale rigwan ahamed (rohan mehara ) kii entry mumbai main hoti he
 He has only one dream, to meet Shakun Kothari once
 is dauraan rigwan kii mulaakaat priya (radhika apte) se hoti he, jo ki ek trading company main kaam karti he
 Rizwan's meeting with Shakun and the incident of various events before and after meeting is also an interesting incident
 ant main kahani alag mukaam par pahunch jaati he, jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why you can watch the film: The story of the film is very interesting and especially its screenplay is amazing
 film dekhte hue interval kab aa jaataa he pataa hi nahin chalata
 The dialogue of the film is also very interesting, due to which Aseem Arora, Nikhil Advani, and Parvez Sheikh are definitely appreciated
 filmein kathanak jis tareeke se aage badhata he vah kaaphi dilachasp he
 We can say that Gaurav K
 Chawla, who is directing the film for the first time, deserves a very good direction
 share bazaar kii research bhi kaabile tarif he
 For a person who does not know about the stock market at all, it becomes easy to watch this film
 film ko darshane kaa ek alag tarah kaa andaaj he
 Which is also very stylish and you will be able to feel it by going to the theater
 kisi he kirdaaron kii adaakaari:saf ali khan ne kai saalon ke baad omkara vaale langadaa tyaagi ke baraabar kii parformens di he
 He is seen performing very well
 iske saath hi apane jamaane kii mashhoor abhinayta vinod mehara ke bete rohan mehara bhi is film ke saath hindi film industry main kadam rakh rahe hai
 But seeing him, he does not feel that this is his first film
 bahut hi umdaa abhinay karte hue najar aae hai
 Radhika Apte has once again explained why she is called the best actress
 radhika priya raay ke role main bakhub najar aati he
 But Chitrangada Singh's work does not have much power, she could have done a better job
 film ke baaki kirdaaron ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Weak Links: The weak link of the film is its later part of the interval which slows down the story a bit
 ek tareeke se yadi film ko 5- 7 minute kam kiya jaataa to or bhi zyada crisp ho jaati
 Before the film's release, it does not have a song that has been a big hit and that is probably why this market is hot in the market
