 Along with this, banks have appealed to customers to get a new debit or credit card issue

 Actually, according to the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India, the card with a magnetic stripe will stop working after December 31
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki 1 janvari se magnetic strip vaale atm yaa credit card bekaar ho jaaenge
 Let us know that at present there are two types of debit and credit card in the country, magnetic stripe and EMV chip

 In such a situation, banks have started giving ATM or credit card with EMV chip

 No fee will be charged from banks for this

 Under the CTS (check Truncation System), an electronic image of the check is captured and there is no need to send the physical check from one bank to another for clearance
 iske ulat non-cts check computer dwaara read nahin kiye ja sakate hai
 This is the reason why they have to physically send from one place to another for clearance

 Asaram has complained of a severe headache
 asaram philhal jail main hi rahenge, kyonki court ne kaha he ki is maamle main sabhi gavaahon ke bayaan nichali adaalat main darj hone ke baad hi unki jamaanat par vichaar kiya jayega
 Asaram, 72, is currently lodged in a Jodhpur jail in connection with the sexual assault of a 16-year-old teenager in his ashram

 The principal of the medical college has been asked to constitute a team of doctors, who will investigate Asaram's disease and suggest the necessary treatment for it
 court ne kaha ki medical board 23 sitambar ko apni report saunpega, jiske baad sunwaayee kii agali taarikh tay kii jaaegi
 The board will consist of a maxifacial surgeon, neutron surgeon, and dentist
 asaram kii jamaanat yachika par adaalat ne kaha ki peedita adaalat main pesh ho chuki he, lekin uske mata-pita or doctor abhi tak nichali adaalat main pesh nahin hue hai
 Senior advocate Salman Khurshid argued for Asaram's bail, which was strongly opposed by lawyer Kamini Jaiswal
 jaiswal ne adaalat ko bataaya ki asaram ke samarthak samasyaayein paidaa karte hai or unki rihaai se samasya or jatil ho jaaegi
 The court was also informed that the jail authorities are undergoing treatment for Asaram, but he is insisting on treatment with Ayurveda method
 khurshid ne kaha ki adaalaton ke kaam nahin karne ke kaaran sunwaayee main deree lag sakati he, is par sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki yadi adaalatein kaam nahin kar rahi hai to iskaa matlab yah hoga ki sabhi vichaaradhinon ko jamaanat de di jaae
 On this, the court was told that the Rajasthan High Court has instructed to hear the case daily, but Asaram and other accused are delaying the hearing

 On the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar recently, Leader of Opposition and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has written a letter to CM and appealed to take some action on it
 tejasvi yadav ne letters twit kiya or likhaa- bihar main bigadati kanoon-vyavastha ko lekar meraa patr
 CM of Bihar is under criminal protection instead of 'crime Prevention'

 unhone likhaa ki aisa lagata he ki asaamaajik tatwon ko khuli chhot de di gai he taaki nirbhik hokar aparaadh karte rahe
 These days there are day-to-day contract murders, political murders, rapes, kidnappings for extortion, and various crimes with the support of people living close to power

 During the hearing on the petition of Congress leader and former Union Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress leader's counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued
 supreme court ne gulam nabi aaazaad ko kashmir jane kii ijaajat de di he, is dauraan vah chaar jilon kaa daura kar sakate hai
 During this time he will not be able to participate in any political program
 vahaan jane ke baad vah supreme court ko ek report soupenge
 Notice has been given to the center in this regard
 supreme court kii ijaajat ke baad ab gulam nabi aaazaad baraamula, anantnag, srinagar or jammu jilon kaa daura kar sakate hai
 The court has been assured by Ghulam Nabi Azad that he will not hold any rally during this time
 somvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan gulam nabi aaazaad kii taraf se abhishek manu singhvi ne adaalat main kaha ki gulam nabi aaazaad 6 baar ke saansad hai, purv mukhyamantri hai phir bhi srinagar airport se waapas bhej diya gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad tried to return on 8, 20 and 24 August
 gauratlab he ki gulam nabi aaazaad ne supreme court main yachika daalkar apane parivaar se milane kii ijaajat maangi thi
 Let us tell you that on August 5, the Central Government had decided to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 isi ke baad se hi kisi bahari netaa ko ghati main jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 When Ghulam Nabi Azad first went, he was sent back from Srinagar Airport, after which he went to Srinagar with Rahul Gandhi and other opposition leaders
 tab bhi unhen srinagar airport se waapas bhej diya gaya tha
 Significantly, earlier, the Supreme Court had similarly allowed CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury to visit Srinagar
 seetaram yechuri ne apni party ke netaa emwai tarigami se milane kii ijaajat maangi thi
 The echo of three incidents that took place in Rajasthan last week will be heard for a long time in state politics
 pehali ghatana he rajya sarkaar kaa bajet, jo mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke maujuuda kaarykaal kaa doosraa bajet he
 The second incident happened exactly when Raje was going to present the budget
 yah ghatana thi pradarshan kar rahe congressiyon par lathi charge, jisamen pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh sachin payalat or yuva congress ke adhyaksh tathaa vidhayak ashok ghayal ho gaye
 The third incident is Amin Pathan's success in getting a no-confidence motion passed against Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) President Lalit Modi and his team, which has been angered by the High Court
 lathi charge ne sabit kar diya ki barason baad pradesh congress ko ek aisa netaa mila he, jo laathiyon ke dar ke bagaiyr aguai kar saktaa he
 Pilot has emerged as a fast-paced leader who is wandering in the state to meet party workers
 yah ashok gahalot, si
 P
 joshi or chandrabhan sareekhe pichley netaaon kii tulana main ek acha badlaav he, jo pradarshnon or andolanon kii aguai karne se darate the or press relies kii siyasat tak simate rahete the
 The Congress Legislature Party boycotted Raje's reply and his budget speech at the end of the debate on the motion of thanks on the Governor's address, resulting in the removal of eight mlas from the House
 lekin is tarah mritpraaya congress kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale payalat ne bagaiyr ek bhi saansad or ginati ke vidhayak hone ke baavjood sabit kiya ki ve ab bhi tufaan khadaa kar sakate hai
 However, due to his strategy, the mlas are losing the opportunity to oppose the ruling party in the House
 lekin yah utana ahm nahin he
 While in opposition, Gehlot never participated in the proceedings of the House, yet he became the Chief Minister
 payalat raaje kii galatiyon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai, jabaki gahalot anuchit hamale karte the, jinamein se kai kaa nishaanaa lalit modi par hota tha
 Like Gehlot, Raje is also crying out for lack of funds, deferring decisions and development work indefinitely, while in his second term, Gehlot started work at the grassroots level without complaining of lack of funds
 haalanki kharaab afasaron kii vajah se ve naakaam rahe
 Raje is also relying on officers who are known for their loyalty to Gehlot or who shy away from taking bold decisions for fear of bad results
 ve centre se kuch afasaron ko laai thim, jinhen congress ke shasankaal ke dauraan badale kii karravaayiyon ke siyaasi maahaul kaa jaraa bhi andaaj nahin tha
 They also went back
 bajet or rajkaaj donon par iske nattejey dekhne ko mili hai
 Raje's second budget is nothing new compared to his previous budget
 samaybaddh pariyojnaon par unka jor beete jamaane kii baat lagati he
 Despite the endless presentation given in the last 15 months, there is no implementation
 ab unhone apana focus badalane kii koshish kii he
 They have rationalized taxes and are emphasizing on the use of information technology to make financial management and governance easier
 ve buniyadi dhaanche ke kayapalat ke liye nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari hasil karne kii ummid kar rahi hai
 But experts say that their consultants on infrastructure are taking so long to prepare documents for public-private partnership that it will not be of any use due to the delay despite expertise
 jamini str par bhi is baar ve sab kaam dikhaai nahin dete, jinke liye ve pichley kaarykaal main jaani jaati thim: unhone shaharon main acchhee sadaken or kachra nibataan kii acchhee vyavastha kii thi
 The state's financial situation is not as bad as it is being told
 isliye aisa lagata he ki apni satta ke tisare saal main unka iraadaa ab tak bachaakar rakhe gaye sansadhano kaa bharpoor istemaal karne kaa he
 The public is also giving them their desired time in every election
 raaje kahati hai, ''ab vakt aa gaya he ki ham kaam karke dikhaaen

 New Delhi: Narrator Pankaj Bisht was honored with the second Rajkamal Chaudhary Smriti Samman in a simplistic literary ceremony held in New Delhi, the country's capital
 is avasar par sweekruti udbodhan main pankaj bisht ne kaha ki yah puraskaar mujhe apane liye mili puraskaron main sabase bada laga he, kyonki yah ek lekhak kii jivan bhar kii kamai ke paise se prarambh kiya gaya he
 i felt like i got the Nobel Prize
 hamaari ammaa kaha karti thim- ghar kaa jogi jogada
 But now the era is second
 vah jitna failaa he, aadmi utana hi simat gaya he
 That is, if your own people do not recognize you, then understand that no one will recognize you
 isliye main apane mitron kaa abhaari hum ki unhone mujhe kuch der se hi sahi, pichley kuch varshon se pahchaanana shuru kar diya he
 Eminent narrator-novelist Pankaj Bisht while receiving the award further said that my mother's opinion about me is the most authentic
 vah kahati thim main nihaayat utpaati aadmi hum
 If i stepped on the earth in Mumbai, i assumed consciousness in Almora
 yah vah shahar he jahaan maine apane pita kii aaleeshaan librari dekhi
 Equally luxurious was his office where the chemical intoxication of printing ink felt for the first time and the inexplicable sound of treadill machines filling white paper with black magic letters sat somewhere deep in my mind like a melody of music
 isliye main jo bhi hum, akasmaat nahin hum, ye meri chuni hui niyati he
 Pankaj Bisht, while referring to Rajkamal Chaudhary's creation 'this Akal Bela', said that every word of ours tells our favoritism
 bina samaaj ko samajhe, bina jane, bina vivek kaa istemaal kiye aap upanyaas lekhan nahin kar sakate
 i have often made Matyu a medium to understand life
 ant main unhone raajakmal choudhary kii rachana 'muktiprasang' kii kuch panktiyaan prastut karte hue kaha-'suraksha ke moh main hisbase pehle marataa he aadmi
 
 
 
 'kaarykram kii shuruyaat main 'mitra nidhi' sanstha ke adhyaksh mahesh darpan ne bataaya ki yah trust sahitya, kala or samskruti ke alaava jivan ke jaruri prashnon se bhi sidhaa sarokaar rakhata he
 It is the result of the inspiration and vision of its patron member poet, the narrator Vishnuchandra Sharma
 unhone bataaya ki yah sammaan har do saal par diya jaataa he, isiilie aagaamee sammaan ke liye aalochak anand prakaash kisi kavi kaa chayan karenge or yah san 2021 main pradaan kiya jayega
 Dr
 Devashankar Naveen, a scholar of Rajkamal Chaudhary literature, told that when he started searching for the works of Rajkamal Chaudhary, his works were not as easily available as today
 unke jivan ko lekar jis tarah kii dharanaen prasaarit kii gayi, unase asahmati jaahir karte hue unhone kaha ki vah ek jimmedaar grihasth, jimmedaar naagarik or ek jimmedaar rachanaakaar the
 He wrote about 4000 pages in 15 years
 naagarik jivan se sansad tak aane kii surangon kaa khulaasa karne vaale raajakmal choudhary kii pahchaan kiya janaa ab bhi jaruri he
 He had the ability to live up to the end of the protest
 is avasar par raajakmal choudhary ke suputr nilmadhav choudhary kaa kahana tha ki vaise to raajakmal choudhary ke sahitya par kaaphi kuch likhaa padhaa gaya he, kintu mujhe unke aalochanatmak niabandh bahut achche lagate hai
 He described it as the fruit of Rajkamal's rituals, that today his offspring are successfully facing the difficulties of life by following high ideals
 unhone raajakmal kii anek kahaniyon kaa zikr kiya or ant main unki ek kavita ke madhyam se apana mantavya saamne rakhaa
 Janki Prasad Sharma, the decisive and well-known critic of the second Rajkamal Chaudhary Smriti Samman, said that this is not the honor of Pankaj Bisht alone
 yah unke daur kii samoochee peedi kii rachanaatmakataa kaa sammaan he
 a decadent culture is born in a period of confusion
 uske bich apni jimmedaari kaa ehsaas karne waalon main pankaj bisht bhi ek mahatvapurn rachanaakaar hai
 Referring to his first story titled 'suli par pada aur messiah' published in 1967, Janaki Prasad Sharma highlighted the importance of 'but Darwaza' and other works of Pankaj Bisht
 unka kahana tha ki 'lekin darwaja' ke mukhya kirdaar kii bechaini puure raajnneetik paridrishy se judati vyanjana he' unhone pankaj ko asahmati kaa vivek lekar chalane vaala rachanaakaar bataaya or kaha ki sanyat swar main pratirodh unka mizaaj he
 Manchastha scholars along with senior authors Vishwanath Tripathi, Vishnuchandra Sharma and Ajay Singh honored Pankaj Bisht with the second Rajkamal Chaudhary Award
 sammaan swaroop shawl, pratik chihn or 21 hajaar kii sammaan raashi kaa check tathaa dow
 Portrait of Pankaj Bisht made by Ratnesh Gupta was presented

 There was a statement by Jyotsna, in which she spoke openly about her husband Pankaj Bisht
 42 baras ke apane anubhavon kaa saajha karte hue unhone kaha ki pichde or daliton ke prati unamem gahan sahanubhuti kaa bhav he
 He takes special care of this in 'samayantar'
 swabhaav se vah kuch gussell hai
 You get angry when your things go here and there
 lekin andar se vah namr or dayavan vyakti hai
 i wish that his passion and 'time difference' continue to gain fame
 varisht patrkaar ramsharan joshi ne pankaj bisht ke sammanit hone par kaha ki unhen laga jaise yah sammaan unhen hi mila he
 We have a friendship since 67
 is dauraan hamaare desh or jivan main bahut kuch badla he
 The dream we had about the country turned into another
 maine pehle pankaj ko ek sahpaathee ke rup main dekha, phir ‘aajkal’ ke sampadak ke rup main, or phir ‘samyaantar’ ke sampadak ke rup main
 i connected with him most during the period of 'time difference'
 pankaj yah sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Not a single digit of it has been missed in the last 20 years
 akele apane dam par vah ise nikaal rahe hai
 Relentlessly
 laghu patrikaon ke itihaas main yah ek aitihaasik uplabdhi he
 Basically, this magazine gives rise to social, cultural, economic and political discourse
 hindi ke itihaas main yah ek chunauteepurn kaam he
 This is EPW Hindi
 sidhaa samaaj se judate hue pankaj kaa yah ek vyakti se sanstha main roopantarit hona he
 This magazine is also widely discussed in non-hindi areas
 pehle raajakmal smriti sammaan se sammanit rachanaakaar ibbar rabbi ne kaha ki hamaara mitra pankaj bisht prarambh se hi jimmedaar he
 a moral urge and sense of responsibility remained equal therein
 isane bachapan se hi sangharsh kiya
 Initially, the concerns that used to remain within them, now the whole country has become their family
 acchhee baat yah he ki inke dwaara sampadit ‘samyaantar’ koi lakshan granth nahin he
 This chronic disease of Hindi is not in this magazine
 yah dinmaan or ravivaar kii tarah he
 It discovers a new direction
 aisi patrika jaise tilak, gandhi yaa vidhyaarthee nikaalte the
 We had never planned a collaborative publication together, but it was unsuccessful, because the book business was rigged
 baad main itane lekhak sanghathan bane kintu kisi ne yah kaam nahin kiya
 Pankaj took 'timeout' to preserve his father's memory and today he is taking it out as a responsible editor
 unhone pankaj bisht or mitron dwaara kiye gaye ullekhneey kaaryon kii yaad bhi dilaai
 In his long statement, the Rabbi also mentioned many important material published from time to time in 'samayantar'
 samaaroh kii adhyakshata kar rahe varisht aalochak anand prakaash ne raajakmal choudhary se judaa surendra choudhary kaa ek sansmaran sunaakar apni baat prarambh kii or kaha ki raajakmal kaa vyaktitv aisa tha ki unki samvednaa kii chhaviyaan hamaare saamne saakaar hone lagati hai
 Describing Pankaj Bisht as an important creator, Anand Prakash said that Jyotsna knows what it is to be the wife of a writer! Ramsharan Joshi remembers him as a journalist and Ibbar Rabbi as a thinker
 pankaj ke kai pahalu hai
 i have been his witness
 70 ke dashak se meraa unase parichay he
 i could write many things myself because of them
 sampadak ke rup main unhone lekhak banaae bhi hai
 He is also a thinker
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki ek lekhak apane sampadak ke saath patari kaise bithaata he
 He is a leftist thinker and writer
 unamem saahas he or galat pravritiyon par atake jarur karte hai
 i find the titles of his compositions very strange
 'lekin darwaja' main 'vatting for god' jaisaa he
 The door is nowhere
 vah prayogshil rachanaakaar hai
 The coffee house is handled by Pankaj Bisht after Vishnu Prabhakar
 sabase bada unka countribution he, aag se khilne vaali yojanaayen bananaa

 dilli main 'shanti, sadbhaav or prasannataa kii ore : sankraman se parivartan' vishay par shuukravaar ko yojit do divasiy rashtriya sammelan main bolte hue mukherjee ne kaha, 'jis desh ne duniya ko 'vasudaiv kutunbakam' or sahishnutaa kaa sabhyatamoolak lokachar, sweekaaryata or kshamaa kii avadharana pradaan kii vahaan ab badhati ashishnutaa, gusse kaa izhaar or maanavaadhikaron kaa atikaraman kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 'it is not that Pranab Mukherjee has first mentioned intolerance
 vah pehle bhi kai dfa ishaaron-ishaaron main badhati ashishnutaa par niraashaa jataa chuke hai
 The event is organized by Pranab Mukherjee Foundation and Center for Research for Rural and Industrial Development
 unhone kaha, 'jab raashtra bahulwaad or sahishnutaa kaa swaagat karata he or vibhinn samudaayon main sadbhaav ko protsaahan detaa he, ham nafrat ke jehar ko saaf karte hai or apane dainik jivan main irshyaa or aakraamakata ko dur karte hai to vahaan shanti or bhaichaare kii bhaavana aati he
 'the former president said,' There is greater prosperity in countries that ensure basic facilities and resources for their residents, provide more security, provide autonomy and people have access to information
 jahaan vyaktigat suraksha kii guarantee hoti he or loktantr surakshit hota he vahaan log adhik khush rahete hai
 Mukherjee said, "regardless of the economic conditions, people remain happy in an atmosphere of peace
 ' aankadon kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha, 'agar in aankade kii upeksha kii jaaegi to pragatisheel arthvyavastha main bhi hamaari khushiyaan kam ho jaaengi
 We need to focus quickly on the paradigm of development
 'shanti-ekta ke sandesh ko yaad karnaa aavashyakgurunanak dev kii 549veen jayanti par unako shraddhasuman arpit karte hue mukherjee ne kaha ki aaj unke shanti or ekta ke sandesh ko yaad karnaa aavashyak he
 He recalled Chanakya's dictum that the king's happiness lies in the happiness of the subjects
 rugveda main kaha gaya he ki hamaare bich ekta ho, swar main sansakti or soch main samta ho
 Mukherjee questioned whether the Preamble of the Constitution is being followed which guarantees socio-economic and political justice, freedom of expression and equality of thought, status and opportunity
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi kii prasannataa kii ranking main bharat 113wein sthaan par he jabaki bhukhon kii suchakank main bharat kaa darja 119waan he
 a similar situation is in the ratings of malnutrition, suicide, inequality and economic freedom
 anbhavi vyakti kaa suzav swikarpurv raashtrapati ke bayaan par kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi kaa kahana he ki kabhi-kabhi koi anbhavi vyakti agar suzav detaa he to usko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 Pranab da has been a capable and experienced politician, he also knows that tolerance is the DNA of the country
 jo sauhaard he wo desh kii samskruti he
 No one has been able to weaken the culture and culture of the country, nor will it be weakened
 desh kii sansthaaon ke patan vaale bayaan par nakvi ne kaha ki 4 saal main modi ke netritv main sanvaidhanik sansthaaen paardarshee or majboot hui hai
 i do not see Pranab da's statement politically, sometimes an experienced person makes a statement, you have to accept it whether you like it or not
 3 saal pehle bhi jataai thi niraashaa3 saal pehle oktobermen bhi raashtrapati rahane ke dauraan pranab mukherjee ne desh ke halaat par niraashaa jataai thi
 Then he said that intolerance is causing huge losses
 sabko aatmsaat karne or sahishnutaa kii apni shakti ke kaaran hi bharat samrudh hua he
 Diversity is the strength of India and we have to protect it at all costs
 raashtrapati pad se hatane ke baad is saal june memrashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke ek kaarykram main sharikahote kaha tha, 'nafrat or ashishnutaa se hamaari rashtriya pahchaan khatre main padegi
 Jawaharlal Nehru had said that there is room for all kinds of diversity in Indian nationalism
 bharat ke rashtrawaad main saare log samahit hai
 There is no distinction on the basis of caste, religion, race and language
 'tab unhone kaha tha, 'ham sahamat ho sakate hai, asahmat ho sakate hai, lekin ham vaicharik vividhta ko dabaa nahin sakate
 After more than 50 years of public life, i am saying that pluralism, tolerance, mixed culture, multilingualism is the soul of our country

 ' Ravindra Jadeja's strike and Cheteshwar Pujara's knock helped India create a new history in Indian cricket with a clean sweep of Australia 4–0 with a six-wicket win on the third day of the Delhi Test
 match kaa puraa scorcard dekhne ke liye clic karen
 
 
 In the first day of the third day 176 minutes were named for the spinners, in addition to India's two wickets in the first innings, Australia's second innings was also dismissed for 164 runs
 pehali pari main 272 ran banaakar das ran kii badhat banane vaale bharat ko 155 ran kaa lakshya mila or usne chaar wicket ke evaj main 158 ran bana kar pehali baar chaar maichon main clin sweep kiya
 Team India scored a hat-trick in Mohali at the crease for 124 minutes and scored an unbeaten 82 from 91 balls with the help of ten fours
 unhone apni kating, panching or drive se isi team ke khilaaf 2010 main bangalore main apane padaarpan test match main kheli gayi pari kii yaad taaja kar di
 Virat Kohli (41) fully supported him
 in donon ne duusare wicket ke liye 104 ran kii saajhedaari karke bharat kii jeet aasaan kii
 On the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla on which the other Australian batsmen struggled except Peter Siddle (50), Pujara taught how to score runs
 nathan leone (94 ran dekar saat wicket) kaa prayaas rabindra jadeja (58 ran dekar paanch wicket) ne bekaar kar diya tha
 Both played their career best
 test cricket main dhoni bharat ke sabase safal captainsidle ne donon pariyon main ardhashatak jadkar nayaa record banaaya lekin australia ke baaki ballebaajon ke paas jadeja, ravichandran aswin or pragyan ojha kaa jawaab nahin tha
 Hyderabad Test: India badly washed the 'kangaroos' India won the last two matches in four days but here on the third day it forced Australia to kneel
 isse pehle bharat ne 2008 main kanpur main dakshin africa ko teen din ke andar aath wicket se haraaya tha
 India won all four matches of a series for the first time in its 81-year history
 usne iske saath hi australia se pichhali shrinkhalaa main mili 0-4 kii haar kaa badla bhi chuktaa kar diya
 Australia lost four or more matches in a series only five times
 vah isse pehle 1970 dakshin africa se 0-4 se parajeet hua tha
 Pujara played a 72-run knock in Bangalore and here he proved Leon wrong by repeating it
 leone ne kaha tha ki bharat ke liye 100 ran kaa lakshya hasil karnaa bhi mushkil hoga
 He got full support of Kohli
 murali vijay ne sweep karne ke prayaas main apana wicket ganvaa diya tha lekin pujaara or kohli ne jald hi australia kii dhundhlee ummid bhi mitaa di
 Kohli's innings lasted for 76 minutes and meanwhile he waited impatiently for a wicket
 isliye jab leone ne kohli ko elbeadblyoo out kiya to darshak apni jagah se khadey ho gayi
 When Tendulkar probably came to bat on Indian soil for the last time, around 35 thousand cricket lovers welcomed him wholeheartedly
 tendulkar (1) keval aath minute tik paye or leone kii pagabaadha kii apil par richard ketelbarog ne unhen out de diya
 The audience was stunned
 apana pehla match khel rahe anjiky rahane (1) bhi teen minute krij par bitaakar gairjimmedaarana shot khelkar pavilion laut gayi
 The situation could have worsened if Australia had not taken a few catches in between
 pujaara ne aakhir main maxwell par mid on, becoward point or mid on par lagaataar teen chauke jadkar score baraabar kiya or phir captain mahendra singh dhoni (naabad 12) ne midwicket par vijayi chaukaa jamaaya
 The audience cheered happily while the players in the dressing room hugged each other and congratulated this historic victory
 isse pehle kotla kii pich ballebaajon ke liye kabrgah najar aa rahi thi
 India lost the remaining two wickets in the morning within eight minutes and 13 balls
 iske baad austrailia kii duusari pari 168 minute main simat gayi
 From his side only Siddle showed the passion for which Australians are known
 australia kaa maxwell se pari kaa aagaaj karwaane kaa jua bhi nahin chalaa
 Jadeja sent both batsmen Maxwell (eight) and David Warner (eight) to the pavilion
 philip huge (chah) bhi nahin chal paye jabaki shen watasan (paanch) captain ke rup main duusari pari main keval 14 minute krij par rahe
 He lost his wicket in an attempt to play Ojha by Across the Line
 jadeja ne lunch ke turant baad steven smith (18) or mishael johnson (shunya) ko lagaataar gendon par out kiya
 Siddle not only saved Jadeja's hat-trick but also played many breathtaking shots after that
 unhen nichle kram main james patinson kaa phir se acha saath mila
 Both of them shared a 54-run partnership for the ninth wicket in the first innings and this time they both added 35 runs
 ishanth sharma ne patinson (11) ko gend viketon par maarane ke liye majaboor karke yah saajhedaari todi
 Siddle completed the half-century in the second consecutive innings with two runs off Ashwin's ball
 vah duniya main nauven number ke pehle ballebaaj hai jinhone donon pariyon main ardhashatak jamaaya
 Ashwin stumps him at the hands of Dhoni on the next ball
 unhone 45 gend kheli tathaa saat chauke lagaaye

 isi tarah airtel ko bhi 23,045 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he
 What is this issue after all, why are telecom companies being destroyed by this? Let's understand it
 kya hota he agredajasteda gros revenue (AGR) sanchaar mantralay ke doorsanchaar vibhaag (dot) dwaara telecom companiyon se liya jane vaala ujes or licencig fees he
 It has two parts - spectrum usage charge and licensing fees, which are 3-5% and 8% respectively
 kya he vivansal main doorsanchaar vibhaag kahata he ki AGR kii gananaa kisi telecom company ko hone vaale sampurna aay yaa revenue ke aadhaar par honi chahie, jisamen diposit intrest or asset bikri jaise gaiyr telecom strot se hui aay bhi shaamil ho
 On the other hand, telecom companies say that AGR should be calculated only on the basis of revenue from telecom services
 saal 2005 main cellular oparator association of india (COAI) ne agiaar kii gananaa ke sarkari paribhaasha ko chunauti di thi, lekin tab doorsanchaar vivaad samaadhaan or apil nyaayaadhikaran (TDSAT) ne sarkaar ke rukh ko vaid maanate hue companiyon kii aay main sabhi tarah kii praptiyon ko shaamil mana tha
 After this, the telecom companies challenged it in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne bhi 24 oktober, 2019 ke apane aadesh main doorsanchaar vibhaag ke rukh ko sahi tehraaya or sarkaar ko yah adhikaar diya ki vah kareeb 94,000 karod rupee kii bakaayaa samyojit gros revenue (AGR) telecom companiyon se vasulein
 It is close to 1 with interest and fine
 3 lakh karod rupee ho jaataa he
 The court asked the telecom companies to deposit the outstanding amount within three months
 isaki sabase zyada maar vodaphone idia par pad rahi he or jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yadi sarkaar ne inhen kuch raahat nahin di to yah companiyaan diwalia bhi ho sakati he
 Experts say that the government should at least forgive the interest and penalty
 telecom companiyaan is aadesh kii supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daakhil karne par vichaar kar rahi hai
 For this, a petition can be filed within a month of the order i
e
 till 24 November
 airtel or vodaphone-idia par sabase zyada bonneretel ko iske tahat 43,000 karod rupee or vodaphone idia ko 40,000 karod rupee dene honge
 The last date for this is 24 January
 sarkaar ke sachivon kii samiti is bare main vichaar bhi kar rahi he ki companiyon ko kis tarah se raahat di ja sakati he
 Not only this, 40 other license holders including PGCIL, railtel, all Internet service providers, Prasar Bharati, satellite communication providers and cable operators will also come under the definition of AGR as decided by the Supreme Court
 haalanki, gaiyr telecom companiyon se yah charge kis tarah se liya jayega, is par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The decision of the Supreme Court has proved to be a big setback for many telecom companies, which were already in bad shape due to the challenge of Jio in the ruining companies and many other reasons
 khaskar telecom company vodaphone-idia limited or airtel ko agiaar kii vajah se bada ghaataa hua he
 Vodafone Idea incurred a huge loss of Rs 50,921 crore in the second quarter
 ise bharat ke corporate itihaas main sabase bada timahi ghaataa bataaya ja rahaa he
 The major reason for the loss is that companies have to provision for AGR i
e
 set aside a fixed amount
 vodaphone ke mukhya kaaryakari (siio) nik read kaa kahana he ki bharat main kaarobaar lambey samay se behad chunauteepurn bana hua he
 He also indicated that Vodafone could consolidate its business from India if the government did not get relief
 is guuruuvaar ko jari nateezon ke mutabik airtel ko july-sitambar, 2019 timahi main 23,045 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he

 Former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has claimed in one of her books that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was initially reluctant to move forward on the indo-us civil nuclear deal and did not even want to meet him because he (singh) did not Wanted to say darasal, is qaraar ke puraa hone ke peeche kondalija rice kaa dabaav banane kaushal tha, kyonki bush prashasan main shaamil kisi ko bhi is qaraar ke puraa hone kii ummid nahin thi
 Kondalija, in his recent book 'no Higher Honor', mentioned the developments in this nuclear deal

 Recalling the early morning hours when Singh was to meet US President George W

 ’’ek din pehle tak samooche bush prashasan ne parmaanu qaraar par ummid chhod di thi, jabaki is qaraar ko white house pure jor shor se aage badha rahaa tha
 At the same time, the then Foreign Minister of India Natwar Singh was in favor of this agreement but the Prime Minister (singh) was not in favor of it because he was not sure that he would agree to New Delhi
 kondalija ne 784 prishthon kii pustak main kaha he, ‘‘natwar is qaraar ke paksh main the lekin pradhanmantri is baat ko lekar aashwast nahin the ki vah isse nayi dilli ko sahamat kar lenge
 Ultimately, Natwar said that he would take this document to the Prime Minister
 ’’america ke tatkaaleen avar videsh mantri nicholas burns ke hawaale se bataaya gaya he, ‘‘videsh mantri ne koshish kii lekin pradhanmantri is qaraar par turant hastakshar nahin kar sakate the
 Before this, Natwar Singh had made a final attempt for a compromise
 kondalija ne likhaa, ‘‘maine raashtrapati (bush) se baat kii
 i said that is not going to happen
 singh ise hone nahin denge
 He said that very bad happened and he did not put more pressure on me
 us raat baad main nik ne mujhe phone kar poocha ki kya mujhe pataa he ki koi qaraar nahin hoga
 "on the day of bush-singh's meeting, Condalija woke up early in the morning, so she was a little tense but resolved not to miss this opportunity
" unhone pradhanmantri manmohan singh se khud milane or is qaraar kaa maarg prashast karne kii antim koshish kii

 For the MCD elections in Delhi, all the parties have pushed the heels
 bijepi ne bhi ravivaar se apni vijay vikaas yatra shuru kar di he
 In which Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has gone out for campaigning
 dilli main bijepi pichley das saal se emsidi kii satta main he
 Therefore, this time the party has named the campaign as Vijay Vikas Yatra
 is yatra ke liye dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari rojaanaa ek jile main jaaenge, jahaan bijepi ke ward ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar karenge
 bjp's Vijay Vikas Yatra started in New Delhi district
 jisamen sabase pehle manoj tiwari ne south moti baag ilaake main road sho kiya
 Tiwari was accompanied by area MP Meenakshi Lekhi and former state president Satish Upadhyay for the road show
 nai dilli bijepi ke jiladhyaksh anil sharma ke mutabik road sho un ilaakon main kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan aam aadmi party ne logon se vot paane ke liye tamaam vaade kiye the
 But after winning the election, AAP leaders or mlas did not return to those areas
 bijepi is yatra ke jariye kejariwal sarkaar kii sachai bhi logon ko bataa rahi he
 Manoj Tiwari said that the BJP is getting the support of the public and the people troubled by Kejriwal's false promises will answer them this time
 tiwari ke mutabik road sho karne ke peeche makasad bhi yahi he ki wo sirf bhaashan nahin karnaa chaahate, balki logon se sidhaa samvaad karenge, jo road sho ke jariye hoga
 The BJP is also trying to capitalize on Tiwari's stardom, which is why his presence is being recorded among more and more people
 bachapan se sunate aae hai hari subjiyan sehat kaa khazaana hoti hai
 Green and leafy vegetables make the brain strong, eyesight increases, health is good
 lekin jin subjiyon ko aap sehat kaa raja maanate aae hai vahi aapke sharir ko khokhla bhi bana sakati he
 Now be careful that the vegetables that you have been eating as a treasure of health can make your body home to many diseases that will not be possible to overcome
 kya aap yakeen kar sakate hai ki phool gobhi, patta gobhi, bangan, or bhindi jaisi kuch subjiyan apko biimaar bana sakati hai
 These vegetables can reach such insects in the body which can push you into the fire of serious illness
 aisa ham nahin kah rahe ye doctoron kaa kahana he
 It is common to find a worm in these vegetables
 lekin agar ye keede aapke sharir main chale gaye to phir mushkilen badi ho sakati he
 Vegetable worms can cause seizures
 sabziyon ke keede se liver kharaab ho saktaa he
 According to doctors, after reaching inside the body, insects can reach the brain through blood
 itnaa hi sharir ke kai angon main andar hi adar ghus kar aapako khokhla kar sakate hai
 Dr
 SC Mishra, medicine consultant at Max Hospital, explains that insects often go to the brain and cause epilepsy, not only that insects reach the stomach and harm them, but also go through the stomach to the liver
 Go
 ji haa subjiyon ke keedon ke larva khaane ke saath pehle to hamaare sharir main jate hai or phir vah khun ke jariye dimaag tak pahunchate hai
 In such a situation, a person can become a victim of epilepsy
 yani use daure padane shuru ho jaaenge
 According to doctors, this situation can be very dangerous for any human being
 iske alaava ye keede pet ke raste liver or kidney ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 It is a matter of concern that if the insects are not detected in time, the matter may become serious
 epilepsy bhayankar rup le sakati he, kidani kaam karnaa band kar sakati hai or liver bhi kharaab ho saktaa he
 According to doctors, salad poses the greatest danger
 agar hari patteydaar subjiyon ko salad ke taur par khate hai to usase sharir main keede pahunchane kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 So be careful and whenever you eat a vegetable, take care of it and test it
 kahin aisa na ho ki aap jise sehat kaa khajaana maan kar kha rahe hai vahiin subjiyan or salad aapako biimaar bana de
 In a country like India, where little attention is paid to cleanliness, fruits, vegetables, raw meat become homes of bacteria
 gande pani or vaataavaran ke jariye ye jeevanu subjiyon falon ko sankramit kar dete hai
 There are also common bacteria such as tap worm, E
 coli which prove to be fatal at times
 jaraa in khatarnaak keedon, krimi or jeevanuon ke bare main jaan lijie
 Tap worm is the most dangerous worm commonly found in vegetables and meat
 ye bhojan ke jariye pehle pet main or phir rakt ke saath milakar sharir ke duusare hisson yahaan tak ki mastishk main bhi pahunch jaataa he
 This causes a dangerous disease such as neurocysticercosis to the human being
 is rog se mirgee jaise daure padane lagate hai
 Like tap worm e
 coli or selamonella jaise rog paidaa karne vaale jeevanu bhi behad khatarnaak he or ye rogaanu bhi subjiyon falon par paae jate hai
 Bacteria like Clostridium, Botulinum, Shigella, Salmonella found in fruits and vegetables are also not behind in attacking the body
 in jeevanuon se sankramit fal or subjiyan chote bacchon, buudhon tathaa kamjor logon ke liye zyada khatarnaak hoti hai
 The dangers range from farm to market
 sabziyon main keede lagane kii badi vajah to kheton main hoti he
 But many times the dirt of the mandis also play with health
 saaf suthri sabji bhi mandi pahunchakar beemaari kaa ghar ban jaati hai
 It does not matter to the businessmen that they keep and sell the vegetables in the places where the vegetables are not fit to eat
 kyonki unhen phikr hoti he sirf munaafe kii
 Vegetables are also a major cause of disease, rather than growing them
 kai baar sabji ugane vaale acchhee paidaavaar ke liye naalon ke pani kaa istemaal karte hai
 Many times vegetables are grown in such places where the dirty water coming out of the factories falls
 aisi jagahon par paidaavaar to acchhee hoti hai lekin ye subjiyan sehat kii bajaae beemaari detii hai
 Many types of bacteria are born in vegetables with such water
 aise main jaruri he ki ham unhen khaane se pehle kuch aihtiyaat baraten
 It is very important that we use raw vegetables, raw fruits, sprouted grains, salads etc
 very carefully
 pani se subjiyon falon ko acchhee tarah dhoen
 Do not use raw meat eggs at all, otherwise our slightest carelessness can prove fatal
 doctoron kii maane to kuch aihtiyaat aapako subjiyon se hone vaale khatarnaak bimariyon se bachaa sakati hai
 Special care should be taken in those vegetables which are closer to the earth
 paalak, gaajar, muuli, phool gobhi, patta gobhi, bhindi, or bangan jaisi subjiyan chunki dharti ke kareeb hoti hai isliye unamem keede hone kaa khatra zyada hota he
 Doctors recommend that such vegetables be washed thoroughly before cutting or peeling
 bina dhoe sabji chhilne se kai baar chhilkon par maujuud jeevanu chhilte vakt sabji ke bheetar bhi ja sakate hai
 Instead of washing water in a vessel, instead of washing, wash the vegetables in the tap
 jarurat padane par chote brush se subjiyon ko saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, vegetables give essential nutritional elements like vitamins, iron to the body, but if carelessness is taken in cleaning them, then it can also cause many diseases

 Reputed business magazine 'fortune' has released a list of 50 great leaders from all over the world
 is list main pehle number par amejon ke jeff bejos kaa naam he, jabaki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejarivala ko bhi is suchi main jagah mili he

 Whereas Seerwind Kejriwal has been ranked 42nd in the list from India
 dilli ke siem ko pradooshan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye od ivan formula laane ke kaaran chunaa gaya he
 'fortune' has said that Kejriwal took a risky step in his political career by launching this ambitious scheme
 lekin dilli kii sadakon se bheedbhad or vaayu pradooshan kam karne ke liye ek saahasik kadam he
 The credit for these things was given to Modi, and in the last year, he was included in this list, adopting an optimistic attitude towards Fortune Nemodi
 magazine ne kaha tha ki modi bharat ko bijness-friendli or kam niyaman vaala desh banane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Along with this, 'fortune' gave credit to Modi for showing seriousness about violence and cleanliness against women
 lekin modi ko is list se baahar kyon kiya gaya? iske liye 'fortune' ne koi safai nahin di he
 Obamapi has been out of the list for three years, only three names of last year have been included in the list this time too
 ye teenon hai jeff bejos, tim cook or pope francis
 US President Barack Obama has been excluded from this list for the third time in a row
 magazine ne tark diya he ki obama ne global chunautiyon or gharelu samasyaon ke saamne sarender kar diya he
 Apart from Kejriwal from South Asia, another name in this list is that of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
 is list main hasina 10wein number par hai
 Fortune has placed him at number 10 on this list for playing an important role in women's empowerment and education in his country
 aise kiya jaataa he chaynis list main subjective aadhaar par teen mandandon ke tahat chunaav hota he
 There should be some new achievement in the name of the person joining the list
 iske saath hi us shaks ke naam jo puraani khyaati thi, usamen bhi koi kami nahin aani chahie
 Not only this, that person should also be able to inspire other people to take some new and change-making steps and his strength should not decrease

 Nine years ago, Abdul Wahid used to teach children, then on July 11, there was a Silesilewar train explosion in Mumbai
 abdul ko dhamaakon main shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After 9 years, the court acquitted him of all charges
 lekin ab na unki ankhon main bacchon ko padhaane ke liye pehle jaisi takat bachi he or na hi jindagi ko lekar khwab
 While talking to NDTV, Abdul Wahid said that in 9 years everything has been ruined
 ab unke paas karne ko kuch nahin he
 Life has come on the road
 vaahid ko khud jail kii chahardivari se chhootane kii khushi he, lekin unka kahana he ki dhamaake ke 12 gunaahagaar bhi nirdosh hai

 Now they have nothing to do
 jindagi sadak par aa chuki he
 Wahid himself is happy to be released from the prison walls, but he says that the 12 guilty of the blast are also innocent
 ve bhi usee tarah dhamaakon ke peedit hai, jis tarah dhamaakon main maare gaye 188 log
 The comments shuukravaar ko doshi tehraae gaye sabhi 12 gunaahagaaron kii sajaa par bahes shuru ho chuki he
 Everyone in the court declared himself innocent
 saare gunahagaaron ke vakeelon ne unki sajaa kam karne ke liye aavedan bhi diya

 If love occurs, 12 regions of the brain become active simultaneously and release chemicals like dopamine, oxitone, adrenaline and vasopressin
 prem kii anubhuti mastishk ke un bauddhik kshetron ko bhi prabhavit karti he jo metafar, baandy image or mental ripregentation jaisi jatil bodh kriyaaon ke liye jimmedaar hote hai
 Research also revealed how certain parts of the brain become active after experiencing different types of love

 sangh kii karypranali or swabhaav kii samiksha ke liye dainik shakha pehali or aavashyak seedhi he, kitne kathith sangh vishleshkon ne yah pehla or sabase jaruri panna padhaa he? jinhen aajkal chunavi hulchalon ke alaava or kuch hota nahin dikh rahaa, unhen yah jaan kar shaayad jhatka lage ki sangh kaa kaam paristhiti nirpeksh nirantar chalata rahata he
 Also, the Sangh has always made necessary changes for any work
 ‘‘parivartan ek aparivartaneey niyam he’’, yah baat haal hi dilli main yojit paanchajnya, orgeniser ke nae patrika vaale swaroop ke locarpan kaarykram main swayan sarasanghachaalak mohanrao bhagwat ne saarvajanik manch se saaf-saaf shabdon main kahi thi
 It may be interesting for those who speculate that the electoral wind has affected the core business of the Sangh that the primary teaching of the Sangh (even from March 24 to 31), in the midst of the pre-poll political events in Delhi
 The class was not only organized like every year but it had 700 more learners than the previous year
 deshbhar main aise virgon ke jariye har varsh 13 se 40 varsh ke takreeban 1 lakh yuva pratibhaagi apane kharch par sangh se judate hai
 It would be wrong to see the increasing number of branches and volunteers only by linking them to the present scenario as the campaign to increase branches has been going on for three years
 yah lagaataar teesri baar he jab sangh kii 2,000 nai shakhaaen badi hai
 From January 2012 only the RSS 222 website
 hmhyahya
 On an average, 2,000 youth are joining the Sangh every month through Shahamd and thus it is the youngest organization in the world dedicated to the society
 bhartiya janata party kii aahat se aakraant rajnatik buddhijiviyon ko is chunaav ke baad thodaa vishram lenaa chahie or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko rajnatik swayamsevak sangh samajhne kii bhul durust kar leni chahie
 Due to the dedication of volunteers, a quick view of the extensive work being done in the areas of forest dwellers welfare, education, service, medicine, etc
, will be enough to explain why the Sangh is called a social organization and its scope and thinking
 How big darasal, sangh ko kosne or satta kii malai par palane vaali rajanetaaon kii ek aisi jamaat he jise raajnneeti ke alaava samaaj kaa kuch pataa nahin
 Such analysts, who deny the pain, anger and indignation of the public or accept the cause of their cause, are more concerned about the stigma of corruption than those which are written on the forehead of the present government
 yah vah sattalolup soch he jo raajnneeti ko samaaj niyantran kaa aujaar or samaaj se bada maanati he
 This is an attempt of thinking that society is getting entangled among themselves
 aaj samaaj ke ekajute hone, is sankalp shakti ke jaag jane kii ashanka se sattavadi raajnneeti ke galiyaaron main logon kii neend udi hui he
 Integral union with society scares him, every knock of volunteers calling for maximum voting at the voters' door, respect for the Sangh in the society and the diligence gathered by the hard work of its workers, threatens him
 aaj agar samaaj kii yah jagriti kisi kii raajnneeti ke liye khatra or kisi ke liye sambhaavna bani he to baat sangh banaam alaan-falaan nahin balki un sarokaaron kii honi chahie jinhone satta ko samaaj kaa drohi bana diya
 True, this is the second time since 1977 when the Sangh's "some" activism is seen in the Lok Sabha elections, but for this it is necessary to review the conditions that the incumbent has created for the society
 sangh kii chintaaon main samaaj kaa swar he lekin is chunaav se use na to apane liye kuch chahie or na hi chunaav parinaamon se sangh rattibar bhi badalane vaala he
 However, the wave of ambitions is high and the competition is interesting
 ummiido kii ek hilor ke bich bhartiya loktantr ke sava arab aabaadi vaale satarangi stadium main indian political lig-sijan 16 kaa yah final muqabla he
 The coin has been tossed for the toss
 josh se bhari janata kii chikhen or hunkaar sirf chit yaa pat dekhne ke liye nahin he
 He expects tremendous blows against corruption, kunbaprasti, havoc balls of inflation
 desh kii growth rate sudhaarney ke liye aise praharon kii darkaar he jo us janata ke dard or jakhm ko sahala sake jisane bahut saha or ab sahane ko taiyaar nahin he

 a wrong answer could cause the woman to lose the amount won (2

 amitabh ne jo sawaal poocha tha wo ye tha- "quit india yani bharat chodo naare kaa izaad inamen se kis swatantraaa senaanee ne kiya tha?" iske chaar vikalp the

 *** In the coming days, the prices of medicines are expected to fall sharply, as the government is likely to set the business margin limit on medicines to 35 percent
 ek sarkari adhikari ne pitiai ko yah jaankaree di
 He said chemists and wholesalers are charging higher margins of up to 2,000-3,000 per cent on some drugs, so there is a huge difference in the cost of medicines and sale price for retail vendors
 adhikari ne kaha, ham isi nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki is visangatipurna margin par lagaam lagaae jane kii jarurat he

 The manner in which the summons has been issued to Parikh certainly verifies the principle that no person is above the law
 nyaayik prakriya jari he or use apana kaam sahi tareeke se karnaa chahie
 But we should also consider whether our laws and procedures are in line with 'make in India' and our new aspirations to become a competitive productive country in the world, in which millions of people can get jobs and economic inequality and poverty To be finished
 sarkaar ke saamne apane vichaar or hit kii baat rakhane ke liye vyapaariyon samet sabhi nagarikon ke adhikaar ke maamle par sawaal nahin uthaaya ja saktaa he
 If anyone has a complaint with the decision of an agency of the government, then he has every right to speak before the higher authorities to review or change that decision
 agar aisa kanoon ke daayre main rahete hue kiya jaataa he or kisi bhi bhrasht tareeke kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he to yah kisi bhi tarah se aapraadhik maamla nahin hona chahie
 Hindalco, the leading company of the Aditya Birla Group, says that Kumar Mangalam Birla's actions were completely within the purview of legal authority to present his case to the government
 sarkaar ko unke is kanoon sammat adhikaar kii raksha kerani chahie
 If a businessman puts his complaint before a higher officer, then the authority of the higher officer should not be questioned to change or amend the decision of the lower officer
 agar nichle adhikari ke faisle ko badla jaataa he to use tabhi aparaadh maananaa chahie jab is baat kaa spasht pramaan ho ki use badalane kaa faisla gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se liya gaya tha, kisi ko galat tareeke se phayda pahunchane ke liye liya gaya tha yaa phir bhrashtachar ke kaaran aisa kiya gaya tha
 If our aspirations of becoming a productive country are to be fulfilled, then any government official or minister's well-intentioned (bona fide) decision must be defended
 bharat ab tak ek pratispardhi utpaadak desh nahin rahaa he
 We need to understand that no country in the world has become a competitive productive country unless there is a mutual cooperation between the government and the industry in achieving this goal
 sarkari vibhaagon ko ve saare kadam uthaane kii jarurat he, jinase desh main vyapaar karnaa aasaan ho or utpaadan laagat main kami aae
 Industrialists also need to do the same in their fields
 lekin iske liye yah anivaary he ki sarkari vibhaagon or udyogpatiyon ke bich khulkar samvaad ho taaki ve zyada pratispardhi banane ke liye sabhi muddon or samasyaon ko thik-thik samaj saken
 Only then necessary steps can be taken to increase competition
 apana paksh rakhane or maujuuda prakriyaaon tathaa niyamon main badlaav kii maang karnaa tab jaruri kadam kaa hissaa mana jayega
 Government officials should not hesitate to take legally correct decisions to increase competition
 bhartiya companiyon ko pratispardhi banane main sarkaar ke kadam is tarah hone chahie ki usase udyog or udyogpatiyon ko aarthik laabh pahunche
 It is based on the concept that the private sector will take the lead in making the country competitive in terms of production
 agar koi udyogpati sarkaar ko apana prativedan detaa he or uske chalate kisi tarah kaa badlaav kiya jaataa he to usase nishchit rup se udyogpati ko phayda hoga
 The problem is that if any private party gets financial benefit from any move of the government, then it can be considered criminal conduct under Section 13 (1) (d) (3) of the Prevention of Corruption Act
 aapkaa aacharan tab puri tarah 'aparaadh' kii shrenee main aa jayega, jab vah 'janhit' main na ho yaa faisla lene main 'pad kaa durupyog' kiya gaya ho
 But what is Damjanhitdya in the situations i am discussing? Is it in the public interest to allocate resources to increase the competitiveness of a private company? But if the same decisions are taken for a public sector company, then they are considered in the public interest
 lekin utpaadan main vruddhi or pratispardhaa chunki mukt rup se nijee kshetra se aati he, isliye koi bhi sarkari adhikari aise faisle kaise legaa jinase nijee kshetra kii pratispardhaa bade
 Similarly, the rule of misuse of the post is also not clear
 kya kisi faisle se yadi nijee kshetra kii company zyada pratispardhaatmak banati he to us faisle ko 'pad kaa durupyog" mana jaae? or vahi faisla agar kisi piesu ke liye liya jaataa he to vah sweekaarya hoga
 In the past, government officials have been reluctant to take decisions in many cases, because they feared being trapped under this law
 is kanoon ko ab purv koyala sachiv par lagu kiya gaya he
 As long as this section of the law remains intact, it will be very difficult to persuade the government officials to change their old attitude
 or aisa rahaa to 'mek in india' kii koshish nishchit rup se adhuri rah jaaegi

 'it is written in Geeta's profile to ask for marriage proposals
 gita vahi mook badhir ladki he jise 2015 main videsh mantralay kii pahal par pakistan se bharat laayaa gaya tha
 Geeta's parents were to be found and sent to her house
 kuch logon ne gita ke apni beti hone ke daawey bhi kiye
 Due to the lack of DNA matching, the real parents of Geetha could not be found till now
 itane intjaar kaa bhi koi nateeja nahin niklaa to gita niraashaa kaa anubhav karne lagi
 In order to bring some newness and stability in his life, his marriage was thought of
 gita ne bhi jab aisi ichha jataai to indore kii anand mook-badhir sanstha ke prabandhan ne videsh mantralay ko is vishay main chitthee likhi
 This is the same organization that was entrusted with the responsibility of looking after the Gita
 isi sanstha ke hostel main gita rah rahi he
 After getting the green signal from External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, a suitable groom is being searched for Geeta
 deshbhar main kai jagah se gita se shaadi ke icchhuk ladakon ke prastaav mil rahe hai
 So far, more than 25 proposals have been received, of which 15 have been sent to the Ministry of External Affairs
 anand mook badhir sanstha se jude gyanendra purohit ne fasebuk par bhi gita kii shaadi ke liye prastaav mangavaaye
 Those who send proposals include soldiers, journalists, businessmen, writers, farmers, sweet shopkeepers
 sirf behatar biodeta vaale prastaav hividesh mantralyako bheje ja rahe hai
 According to whatever instructions will be received from there, a decision will be taken regarding the marriage of Geeta
 gita ke liye parichay sammelan se lekar soshal cites tak duulhe kii talash kii ja rahi he
 It is also being said that interested youth can also contact Anand Mute Deaf institution directly in Indore along with Boydetta
 sanstha se judi monica purohit ke mutabik biodata bhejne waalon main 70% mook-badhir hai or 30% saamaanya hai
 'aaj Tak' spoke to several applicants wishing to marry Geeta
 jaise indore ke paas hi mangalia main rahane vaale mahesh mandir main puja karaate hai
 Mahesh says that if he gets married to Geeta, he will be very happy
 aise hi mithaiyon kaa kaam karne vaale suresh sitaudiya kaa kahana he, ‘main gita se shaadi karnaa chahta hum, main har ravivaar use ghumaane le jaaoongaa
 'the subject was also talked to couples in Ludhiana and Saharsa in Bihar who once claimed to have children of Geeta but their claims in DNA matching could not be confirmed
 aise hi ek shaks hai ludhiana main rahane vaale janardan mahato
 Originally a resident of Bihar, Janardhana still claims that he is Geeta's father and should get a chance to marry on Geeta's marriage
 janardan ke parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ko bharosa he ki gita kii shaadi hogi to unhen nyotaa milegaa or ve ‘beti’ kii khushiyon main shaamil ho sakenge
 Similarly, a couple living in Kabira Dhap village in Saharsa district of Bihar have also claimed that Geeta is their daughter, but they could not show any evidence for this
 ‘ajtak’ is gaanv main pahunchaa to dampati ke bete balram mahato se mulaakaat hui
 Balaram said that Geeta should be married in a good house wherever she is
 balram ke mutabik uske pita ko nyotaa mila to ve shaadi main jaaenge
 (with inputs from Munish Atre in Ludhiana) us din police kii kismat chamak gai
 What he caught as a small crook turned out to be a criminal and a sharp shooter
 pichley hafte satna police ke haath ek sarrapha vyavsaayee ko lut kar bhaag rahaa badmaash saraman shivahare laga
 The Shivhare whom she considered a newbie crook, when she revealed her adventures, the police themselves were shocked
 panna jile kaa rahane vaala saraman mukhya rup se sarrapha kaarobaariyon ko hi nishaanaa banaata tha
 On 25 July, Sarman and two of his companions attacked the bullion businessman Ramdutt Soni of Mukhtiarganj in Satna and ran away from the shop carrying a bag full of jewelery
 soni or unki patni shobhaa ke virodh karne par saraman ne goli chalaa di, par tab tak bheed jamaa ho chuki thi
 Sarman's companions escaped but he got into the hands of the crowd and people handed him over to the police
 police ke saamne jab saraman ne apana munh kholaa to paheli ban chuke kai ansulajhe maamalon ke raaj bhi khule
 In 30 years, Sarman confessed to the murder and robbery of 18 people from Gwalior to Jabalpur, Indore and the state in just three years
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki bataur sharp shooter vah kai rajyon ke aparaadhiyon se judaa hua tha
 Meanwhile, the Satna police gave information in Gwalior, due to which three of Sarman's companions Rajkishore, Vedprakash and Deepak Chaurasia were also caught while another partner, Inder Singh Rewa
 satna main lut ke samay saraman kii chalaai goli rajakishor ke pair main lag gai thi
 For the last three years, this gang had become another name of awe for the bullion traders of the state and had also killed many businessmen
 pichley ek saal main gwalior main ratna kaarobaari rajendra sahu, prabhaat agarwal, rakesh jain, niraj gupta, vijay jain sahit kai vyavsaayiyon kii hatya ko saraman or uske giroh ne hi anjaam diya tha
 a diamond merchant in Indore in 2008 and Dr
 varsha samet unke compounder kii hatya bhi saraman ne hi kii thi
 He used to murder with a pistol robbed from the police
 ek pistaul usne jabalpur main hawaldaar rajkumaar kii hatya karke luti thi or duusari gwalior main shivakant naam ke sipaahi ko goli markar hasil kii thi
 Now STF including Gwalior, Satna, Indore and Ujjain police are engaged in searching their network
 indore or ujjain main saraman ke kai bank khate or loker mili hai
 Twenty fake PAN cards, 15 driving licenses and 25 cellphones have also been recovered from him
 gwalior range ke iji vijay yadav bataate hai, ''saraman kaa ek saathi deepak gwalior main kai sarrapha vyavsaayiyon ke yahaan kaam kar chukaa tha, isliye use unase sambandhit kai baaten maaloom thi jo vaardaat main phydemand sabit hoti thim
 Whereas Vedprakash and Rajkishore used to loot goods under the guise of tantra-mantra and pujapath
 '' lut ke maal se inhone sampatti or kai kaaren kharidi thim
 Millions of rupees were searched in Gwalior's house in Rajkishore
 ke gahane mili, deepak ke ghar se police ko kai darjan farji pan card, driving license, matadaata pahchaan-patr or sau se bhi zyada bikon kii chaabiyaan milin hai
 During interrogation, Sarman also said that he used to keep the loot money in the bank locker
 pistaul bhi vah loker main hi rakhata tha
 However, more than a dozen of his lockers have not been received, so the police suspect that he would have looted the stolen money and jewelery elsewhere
 pradesh estf ab yah pataa laga rahi he ki saraman kaa sambandh kin-kin rajyon ke badmaashon se he
 The STF also suspects that Sarman may have links with the Mumbai underworld or may be associated with a gang that wants to spread terror in the state
 reva range ke iji ji
 R
 meena kehete hai, ''saraman ke aparaadh karne kii style ko dekhte hue police ko uske gahare aapraadhik sambandh hone kaa andeshaa he jiske bare main pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 After the arrest of Sarman and his gang, the Gwalior police, which has failed to contain the growing crime in the area, is breathing a sigh of hope that the sensational murder of businessmen in the area for the last one and a half years is probably now Will be closed
 saraman jaise shaatir aparaadhiyon se nibatane ke gur sikhaane ke liye pradesh police ab uske aparaadh karne kii style ko prashikshu sipaahiyon ko padhaane kii bhi taiyaari kar rahi he

 India may have won the Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa and recently managed to equalize a three-test series, but when it comes to ODI cricket, Team India has no answer for the hosts

 The Indian team then went to South Africa under the leadership of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar in 1996–97, and this time instead of the bilateral ODI series, he played the tri-series, with the third team being Zimbabwe
 bharat ke liye yah siries bhi kaaphi niraashajanak rahi or vah is shrinkhalaa main ek hi jeet darj kar paaya or vah bhi zimbabwe ke khilaaf
 Team India played a tri-series in South Africa led by Sourav Ganguly, one of India's most successful captains in 2001-02
 bharat ne is shrinkhalaa main dakshin africa ko lig charan main ek baar haraaya, jabaki do baar kenya ko maat di
 Team India, however, also lost to Kenya in this series, while South Africa beat India in three matches including the final
