 apane saathi kii rajamandi kaa bhi dhyaan rakhen
 4
 saathi main kami na nikaalen: ye dhyaan rahe ki koi bhi vyakti parfect nahin hota
 So it is not necessary for your partner to have all the qualities
 pehali raat uski kamiyaan nikaalkar aap rishte main khatas hi paidaa karenge
 Book of shortcomings on the first night do not leave good feelings in your partner's mind
 soshal media: video viral hone ke baad hangaamaa5
 Don't just listen to yourself, listen to your partner too: you like to speak and talk a lot
 par pehali raat aap sirf apni hi naa kahen
 Listen to your partner too
 isse aapke partner ko acha lagegaa or vah sammanit bhi mahasoos karegaa
 Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has received relief from the Supreme Court

 The government had filed this petition in the Supreme Court against the decision of Sindh High Court
 isamen kaha gaya ki purv sainya shaasha kii videsh yatraaon par bain jari rakhi jaye, kyonki ve desh chhodkar ja sakate hai
 While giving the verdict, the Supreme Court said that there is no need to stop the 72-year-old foreign travel of Musharraf
 jab tak ki centre sarkaar unpar koi pabandi na lagaaye
 Government may take action: a five-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali has approved Musharraf to go abroad for medical examination
 haalanki, supreme court ne sarkaar kii karrwai par koi roak nahin lagaai he
 In such a case, in the case of treason, by placing Musharraf's name in the Exit Control List (ECL), he can prevent him from leaving the country
 musharraf ke vakil ne kya kahamusharraf ke vakil farug naseem ne bataaya ki sarkaar gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se musharraf ko duusare mulk jane se roak rahi he
 According to the Supreme Court's decision, the ban on his foreign travel has been lifted
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki sarkaar ko adhikaar he ki vah isiel ke jariye kisi ko bhi mulk chhodane se roak sakati he
 When the foreign military ruler's foreign trip was banned when the Pak government filed a sedition case against him in 2013
 musharraf ne 2007 main samvidhan ko khatm kar diya tha
 This offense has the provision of capital punishment under Article 6
 april 2014 main sarkaar ne musharraf kii videsh yatra par roak laga di, lekin karachi main sindh hai court ne june 2014 main faisla sunaate hue bain hataa liya
 The government challenged this decision of the High Court in the Supreme Court

 People like Virendra Madan have worked with Rajiv Gandhi but today he had to take a written examination to become a media panelist
 pariksha dene ke baad amarnath agarwal ne kaha ki yah acha prayaas he or congress main ho rahe badlaav ko dikhaata he
 If we have to walk with the new generation, then we have to change accordingly
 dekhiye congress netaaon ne kaise-kaise sawaalon ke jabaab die
 
 
 > How many divisions, districts and blocks are there in UP?> How many reserved seats of Lok Sabha are there in UP?> How many seats did Congress win in 2004 and 2009?> What percentage of votes did Congress get in Lok Sabha 2014 and 2017 Vidhan Sabha?> UP How many Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha seats are there?> How many Assembly seats are there in one Lok Sabha seat in UP?> Which Lok Sabha seats have more or less assembly seats than standard?> What is the function of the spokesperson?> Why do you want to be a spokesperson?> What are the main points of failure of Modi government?> What are the main points of failure of Yogi government?> What were the achievements of Manmohan Singh government?> Three major news stories in newspaper today What are the statements on which the Congress spokesperson can continue? However, even if the Congressmen have given the written examination, jabaki intervyuu dene ke liye unhen apane se junior netaaon ke saamne khadaa hona pad rahaa he

 Everyone knows the value of currency notes, but very few will know how much it costs on that currency note
 To find out how much the cost of different denomination notes comes, India Today resorted to the Right to Information (RTI) route
 RTI ke tahat bhartiya rigerv banknotemudran (P) limited se sawaal kiya gaya- “alag alag mulyon ke note print karne par sarkaar kaa kitna paisa kharch hota he?”is puri kavayad kaa nateeja is jawaab ke saath saamne aayaa
 Government of India 4 on a currency note of 2000 rupees
 18 rupye kharch karti he
 Similarly 2 on a 500 rupee note
 57 rupye or 100 rupye ke ek note par 1
 51 rupees comes from the government
 jahaan tak 10 rupye ke ek karansi note kaa sawaal he to sarkaar is par 1
 It costs 01 rupees
 hairaani kii baat he ki 20 rupye ke note par 10 rupye ke note kii tulana main ek paisa kam kharch hota he
 At the same time, on the 50 rupee note, 1 like the 10 note to the government
 01 rupye hi kharch karne padate hai

 3 on printing old 500 rupee note
 09 rupye kharch aata tha
 This means that now 500 new notes are in circulation, it costs 52 paise less to print per note
 isi tarah radd ho chuke 1000 rupye ke puraane note ko print karne par sarkaar ke 3
 It costs 54
 ab 1000 rupye kanotato rahaa nahin lekin notebandi ke baad prachlan main aae 2000 rupye ke note par 4

 didisie ke upaadhyaksh or purv test khilaadi chetan chouhan ne daawa kiya ki jab match 23
 Paused after 3 overs, the officials were considering whether it would be okay to continue the match or else Hurst officially told them that the Sri Lankan team was reluctant to play further, losing five wickets for 83 at that time
 Were given chouhan ne kaha, ‘‘match referi ne mujhe adhikarik rup se bataaya ki ek team aage khilne ko taiyaar nahin he or vah unhen khilne ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa
 It cannot be the Indian team as Mahendra Singh Dhoni was ready to play
 srilankai team ne 83 ran par paanch wicket ganvaa diye the or isaliye unhen peeche hatane kaa faisla kiya
 It was the Sri Lankan team that decided to leave the field and flee
 ’’chouhan ne hurst ko doshi tehraate hue kaha ki match referi ne mukaable ko radd kar galati kii
 He said, "everyone associated with sports should be convicted for this dispute, including match referees
" mujhe nahin lagata ki agar yah match australia or dakshin africa ke bich hota to ise radd kiya jaataa
 If the pitch was dangerous to play, then the match should have been canceled within five overs, it is not allowed to run for 24 overs
 ’’unhone hairat jataayi, ‘‘main isse sahamat hum ki yah antarrashtriya match ke liye adarsh nahin tha, lekin yah khatarnaak bhi nahin thi or aisi bhi nahin thi ki is par khelaa na ja sake
 i have also played on a similar pitch and worse pitch
 maine kabhi bhi aisa nahin sochaa ki match itani aasaani se radd kiya ja sake
 "he said," We also offered the second wicket and said give us an hour and it will be ready for you
 ’’chouhan ne kaha, ‘‘match ko jari rakhana chahie tha kyonki kareeb 45000 log maidan par the or do-teen karod log tivi set se chipke the
 Only nine balls out of 130 were slow or uneven bouncy, but this could not cancel the match
 is match ko bachaane ke liye eemaandaar prayaas kiya janaa chahie tha
 Talking to reporters after the executive meeting held at the home of DDCA President Arun Jaitley, Chauhan softened his stand and hoped that the ICC would understand that it was only an 'accident', which asked the BCCI to respond to the controversy
 is
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen puraa bharosa he ki isisi yah jarur mahasoos karegi ki yah ek galati he, ek durghatana he, jise jaanboojhkar nahin kiya gaya
 The DDCA official threw the dice into the court of the bcci's ground and pitch committee led by Daljit Singh, who was dismissed on Sunday
 chouhan ne kaha, ‘‘ham naitik jimmedaari lete hai or apni jimmedaari se nahin hatana chaahate, lekin pich or maidan dalajit or unki samiti ke nirdeshon ke anusaar banaayi gayi thi
 We did what we were told
 ve visheshgy hai, ham nahin
 DDCA Secretary SP Basnal also upheld the conviction saying it was a mistake to 'blindly trust' Daljit Singh
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamane pich kii puri jimmedaari dalajit ko saunp di thi, iske baad se isaki jimmedaari unki thi, hamaari nahin
 You can say that we did not pay attention to the preparations
 un par andhaa vishwaas karnaa hamaari galati thi

 Even if you are not sitting in this train, you will probably not be unaware of what it means for the people of Mumbai
 ek kone se duusare kone daftar jane vaale logon kii jindagi kaa kis tarah local train hissaa bani hui hai, isaki ek baangi photo jarnlist anushri fadanvis kii khinchi gai tasveeron main dekhne ko milti he
 Anushree works as a photo journalist at Mumbai's Indus Images Company and has some very interesting pictures of women traveling in a local train on her Instagram account

 For example, someone's birthday or a Teej festival, these women who have been traveling together for years make such good friends in their journey that they do not shy away from celebrating any special occasion
 tippaniyan Women pass around paper plates filled with food in the ladies compartment of the Mumbai local train
 If there is any birthday, like in this situation it was the birthday of one of the members' daughter, or any other festival, ladies in the compartment don't spare any effort to celebrate that particular occasion
 And they do it so lovingly and also invite the other women around them
 i have also been invited in celebrations so many times
 i am sure most of the other ladies are also must have experienced the same
 And if you think it is one woman's responsibility to organize these then no
 Women take it upon themselves, they plan and decide the budget and share
 i have been welcomed so lovingly in some groups and sometimes i feel like i am a part of them
 While some women want to sleep and want silence in the train
 They crib of such women in groups 
 But there is something about these groups that i love
 Sometimes it is this sense of belonging, companionship that draw these women together, 
 Also the love, the care and the crazy fun that they have

 court ne yah bhi kaha ki agar durga shakti khud court aati hai, to vichaar kiya ja saktaa he ki us par sunwaayee ho yaa nahin
 Lawyer ML Sharma, who filed the petition, had argued that IAS Durga Shakti was following the directions of the Supreme Court
 iske jawaab main court ne kaha ki durga shakti is baat ke liye sakasham hai ki vah apni baat sahi manch par rakh saken, lihaaja is tarah ke maamle main lokhit yachika kaa matlab nahin banataa
 The court also said that if Durga Shakti comes to the court herself, then it can be considered whether it should be heard or not

 No injuries reported— ANI UP (@aninewsup) July 17, 2016 agle loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress har haal main food sicurity bill paas karnaa chaahati he
 These days the party is in the process of calling a session of the Lok Sabha for this bill
 party or sarkaar ke diggaj vipakshi dalon se baatcheet main jute hai
 But the NCP, its ally in the UPA, has doubted the success of the bill
 ensipi supremeo or krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne somvaar ko kaha ki chaaron taraf food sicurity bill kaa hallaa he, magar upie sarkaar ke paas na to is skim ko chalaane ke liye paisa he or na hi ise lagu karne ke liye paryaapt sarkari dhaancha
 Apart from this, Pawar also claimed that the country does not have as much storage as is needed to implement this bill
 desh ke krishi mantri ke sawalia nishaan lagane ke baad congress ke political managers par sawalia nishaan uthanaa tay he
 However, Pawar's attitude has also been at the center of criticism at times
 masalan, agast 2010 main supreme court ne garibon ko muft anaaj baantne ke masale par laaparvaahee ko lekar unki aalochana kii thi
 The court during the hearing of a PIL had said that the rotting grains in the godowns should be distributed among the needy
 krishi mantri ne ise ek suzav kii tarah liya or kaha ki aisa karne ke liye tantra ke paas saadhan nahin
 At the next hearing, when the court came to know the government's argument, he rebuked that this suggestion was not an order
 is masale par pavaar or upie sarkaar kii loksabhaa main bhi jamkar khinchaai hui thi
 JDU leader Sharad Pawar had cited his tenure as saying that the NDA government had also distributed food grains, so why can it not happen now
 udhar, bijepi ne food sicurity bill ke masale par kaha he ki uski party jin rajyon main sarkaar chalaa rahi he, vahaan peedies skim khatm na kii jaae
 It is worth noting that these schemes are running successfully in the BJP ruled states, especially Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and the central agencies have also confirmed this
 sipiem ne bhi bijepi ke sur main sur milaate hue kaha ki peedies skim khatm nahin kii jaani chahie
 At the same time, the party raised the question why only half the cities and three fourth villages are being brought under its purview
 sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahi samaajawaadee party ne bhi bill par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki isse kisaanon ko nuksaan hoga

 saharanpur kii sadak doodhli gaanv main patharbaji kii ghatana ke baad ab sannata pasra he
 PAC and police force are stationed in the village
 ambedkar jayanti or sant ravidaas jayanti ke naam par gaanv main yatra nikaalane ke baad hue patharav or hinsa ke chalate dehshat kaa maahaul he
 Not only the village, the family of SSP Luv Kumar of the district is also in shock
 maamle kii tah tak jane ke liye ajtak pahunchaa saharanpur jile ke gaanv sadak doodhli main jahaan se is puure bavaal kii shuruyaat hui
 On April 20, a procession was taken out in the name of Sant Ravidas Jayanti on Ambedkar Road in this village
 saharanpur jile ke janakapur thane main darj FIR ke mutabik 20 april ko ashok bharti naamak shaks ne sadak doodhli gaanv main shobhaayatra nikaali
 According to the FIR registered, permission was not obtained from the administration for the procession which took place in the name of Ambedkar Jayanti
 jaise hi shobhaayatra gaanv doodhli pahunchi, bijepi ke saansad raghav lakhan paal, unke bhai rahul lakhan paal, devband se bijepi vidhayak pradesh samet saikadon samarthak jabaran yatra nikaalane kaa prayaas karne lage
 The FIR states that despite all the police refusing lakhs, they continued forcibly shouting provocative slogans, following which stone pelting started by the Muslim sect standing on the other side
 juluus main aae logon ne kiya patharav!sadak doodhli gaanv main 20 taarikh ko ho is ghatana ke chashmadid mukhiya khaadim hossain ne ajtak se baatcheet main bataaya ki vah is dauraan mauka-e-vaardaat par hi khadey the
 According to Mohammed, despite the police's refusal, Yatra wanted to enter the village and when the administration refused to come, the people involved in the procession pelted stones, in response to this the Muslim society also stoned
 khaadim hossain ne bhi kaha ki juluus ke saath bijepi saansad raghav lakhan paal maujuud the
 The 18-year-old Mohammad Kaif claims that stone pelting started on behalf of the people who came in the first procession
 vivaad ke peeche chunavi raajnneeti!gaanv main hamaari mulaakaat ajmal se hui
 Ajmal said, 'on that day the people of the village came to know that some people from outside were bringing the procession
 saare log baahar ke the saansad raghav lakhan paal the or bhaajapa ke kai saare log bhi the
 When the police stopped them from coming in, they started throwing stones
 uske baad is taraf se bhi patharav hua
 It has been 67 years before that no such journey took place
 jab kisi nai parampara ke liye koi ijaajat nahin lee gai, isliye yah vivaad hua
 Many years ago, meat was also thrown in the mosque
 dow
 Ambedkar wrote the constitution for everyone, took care of everyone
 danga fasaad karnaa or baahar ke logon kaa pathar or aujaar lekar aana, yah sab raajnneeti he, kyonki mahayor kaa chunaav aa rahaa he or raghav lakhan paal chaahate hai unka bhai mahayor ho jaae
 Muslims should split up and Hindu Dalits turn to them
 'ajmal kii maane to yah bavaal is saal july main hone vaale saharanpur ke nikaay chunaav ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Road Dudhli village now comes under Saharanpur corporation and elections are going to be held in this corporation for the first time in July this year
 gaanv waalon se baat karte to juluus main nahin hoti aapattimaamle kii or padtaal karne ke liye ham gaanv ke andar bani masjid ke paas gaye
 The time for namaz was over, so many people from the village met us there
 hafiz mohammad noman ne kaha ki patharbaji ke ghatana ke dauraan vah bhi vahaan par maujuud the
 Noman said that the people who came in the procession first threw stones at the police, after which the Muslim society also threw stones
 hamane noman se poocha ki aakhir ambedkar yaa sant ravidaas jayanti ke naam par juluus nikaalane se muslim samaaj ko kya pareshaani ho sakati he?is par numaan ne kaha ki is gaanv main aisa koi niyam he hi nahin to phir jabardastee kyon kii ja rahi he? hafiz mohammad noman ne kaha ki agar juluus nikaalnaa tha to gaanv waalon se pehle baat kii jaani chahie thi, tab yatra nikaali jaani chahie thi
 The people standing with Noman said that none of the people who came in the procession was a Dalit society in the village, but people from outside
 muslim samaaj ke tamaam logon ne kaha kii yatra ke naam se unhen aapatti nahin he basharte jayanti kii yatra prashasan se anumati lekar ho
 Earlier, the procession of the procession was not done by Luv Kumar, SSP of Saharanpur
 lav kumaar ke mutabik sadak doodhli gaanv main iske pehle kabhi bhi ambedkar yaa sant ravidaas jayanti ke naam par shobhaayatra nikaalane kii pratha nahin thi or prashasnic aadesh the ki gaiyr paramparaagat shobhaayatraaon ko naa hone diya jaae
 The proposed Shobha Yatra was not allowed on April 14 to prevent deterioration of law and order
 esaspi lav kumaar ne kaha ki 14 april ko shobhaayatra nikaali jane ke liye unhen aavedan mila tha, lekin local thane kii report ke baad yatra nikaalane kii ijaajat nahin di gai
 According to the SSP or the yatra was unconventional and according to the rules it could not be allowed and that was probably the reason after which the 20th date incident occurred
 SSP sahab kii maane to anumati maangane vaale gut ko niyamon ke takaaje se gyaat kara diya gaya tha
 Despite the permission of the rally was not given by the administration, the report of Local Intelligence says that on April 19, the process of procession by some elements in the village was revealed
 saharanpur police ke mutabik 14 april kii yatra nikaalane ke liye bajrang dal ke vikramnajit ne arji di thi, lekin local intelligence or sthaneey police kii report par prashasan ne is shobhaa yatra kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 Not only this, SSP Luv Kumar told Aaj Tak that he got information about this from local intelligence just 1 day before the Sobha Yatra of April 20, after which the administrative settlement was posted in the village
 itnaa hi nahin jab juluus lekar BJP saansad or unke samarthak gaanv main pahunche to unhen rokane kii puri koshish kii gai
 There are some other facts in this whole case
 iske pehle sadak doodhli gaanv main kabhi bhi ambedkar or sant ravidaas jayanti ke naam par shobhaayatra nahin nikaali gai
 Although Bhandara is organized by the Dalit society in the village on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti on 14 April, it was never disputed in the village
 padtaal main duusari baat saamne ai ki 7 saal pehle isi tareeke se sant ravidaas jayanti ke maukey par shobhaa yatra nikaalane kii koshish kii gai thi, jisaki anumati radd hone ke baad prashasan kii ore se gaanv main aise kisi bhi gaiyr paramparaagat shobhaa yatra kii manaahi ke aadesh die gaye the
 Outsiders were in procession! It was during the rule of Mayawati that the village Dudhli village came under the Saharanpur Corporation and this time would be the first time that the people of Dudhli village would vote for the local corporation elections
 gaanv main aage hamaari mulaakaat muslim samaaj ke kai or logon se hui or zyaadaatar kaa yahi kahana tha ki is gaanv main 1500 muslim parivaar or 600 dalit parivaar bade hi sukun se rahete rahe or kabhi koi vivaad nahin hua
 Minor incidents did happen, but this did not disturb the peace of the village
 gaanv main bujurg or muslim samaaj ke survey sarva mukhiya abdul maajid kaa bhi daawa vahi he kii shobhaayatra lekar aae log is gaanv ke nahin balki bahari the
 The question arises that was it deliberately trying to disturb the peace of this village? Or did the Muslim community object to the Shobha Yatra of Ambedkar and Sant Ravidas Jayanti? All the people of the Muslim community in the conversation believed that they did not have any problem with the Shobha Yatra, provided it is with the approval of the villagers and the permission of the administration
 muslim samudaay se baat karne ke baad ham gaanv ke duusare chor par gaye jahaan dalit samudaay rahata he
 There is silence in the village after the uproar on the 20th and there is an atmosphere of panic among the people
 dalit samaaj ke log khulkar is maamle par kuch bhi bolne se bachate rahe
 But the truth that came out in the conversation was that the people who came to the village after taking the journey were not outsiders but from this village
 dalit samaaj ke log bhi maanate hai ki is gaanv main pehle donon samudaayon ke bich kabhi koi bavaal nahin hua
 Lakhan Pal forcibly entered ssp's house! On 20 th, Lakhan Pal and his supporters reached the house of SSP Luv Kumar of Saharanpur after opposing the procession
 tasveeron main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki lakhan paal apane samarthakon ke saath baari hujum main jabaran SSP ke ghar main ghus gaye
 When this incident happened, Luv Kumar was not present in his house
 is maamle main bhi bhi saharanpur police ne kai logon ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 According to the FIR, local BJP MP Lakhan Pal, from the main gate of SSP Luv Kumar's house on April 20, forcibly entered his voice with provocative slogans and shouting slogans from the police administration of Murdabad
 shor-sharabe or bavaal ke baad ghar main maujuud SSP lav kumaar kii patni shakti or unke donon bachche kaaphi ghabara gaye
 SSP Love Kumar himself told Aaj Tak that his family was shocked to see the crowd coming into the house
 aaj bhi SSP lav kumaar ko unke doston or rishtedaaron ke phone aa rahe hai jo unka haalchaal jaananaa chaahate hai
 So far 6 firs have been filed in the case, but if SSP Luv Kumar believes, more than 10 people have been arrested so far
 lekin bijepi saansad raghav lakhan paal, juluus main shamildevaband vidhayakabrijesh samet kai bade naam police kii giraft se abhi bhi baahar hai

 Well, till about 1 o'clock in the night, this party went on, then all the stars went one by one towards their house and even William Smith went to the nearby hotel
 akshay kumaar kai dinon baad itani raat tak party kar rahe the or khabaron ke mutabik subah uthakar apni film 'jolly elelbi 2' kii shooting ke liye phir se lakhanu chale gaye
 By the way, are Akshay and Will Smith preparing for a new project? Come on, whenever we come to know about this, we will definitely tell you

 kyonki pakistani agenciyaan aupchaariktaayen puri karne ke liye vakt le rahi thim
 i was desperate
 maine pakistani adhikariyon se guzarish kii ki ve aupchaariktaayen jitani jaldi sambhav ho saken, puri karen kyonki ek bete ko apni maa se dur rakhana amanviya he

 pakistan main mere ek dost, jisase main online hi mila tha, usne ladki se milwane main madad kaa vaada kiya
 He guided me through Pakistan through Afghanistan
 main bhavuk tha to maine aisa karne kaa faisla kiya

 baad main usee dost ne mujhe dhokhaa diya or farji ycard thama diya
 He only informed the Pakistani authorities about me
 tab mujhe jaakar ahsaas hua ki ye sab jaal bichaaya gaya tha
 Because people were already sitting ready to catch me on that side

 sawaal-jail main aapkaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa?hamid-mujhe pataa nahin hota tha ki kab din hota tha or kab raat
 i was taken to the washroom once in 24 hours, that too for a minute
 sirf zindaa rahane laayak khaanaa diya jaataa tha
 i was not given a bath for 40 days
 kai baar main kai din tak bina khaane ke bhi rahaa
 In the summer, i was not allowed to bathe and i did not tolerate bad odor on my own as it had been infected with insects
 jab mujhase poochtacha hoti thi to aise yatnaaen di jaati thim ki meri bain aankh ke retina main chhed ho jaaen
 Sometimes i fainted
 kai baar khun kii ulti hoti thi
 Question- You were called a spy from Pakistan? Hamid - i am not a detective
 meraa dil mujhe vahaan le gaya
 My brain should have known better
 lekin pakistani adhikariyon ko mere jasoos hone ke bare main kuch sabit nahin karnaa tha
 On 12 May 2015, i was presented before the Peshawar District Magistrate's Court, where the DM himself forced me to sign a false confession
 virodh jataane par bhi mere anguuthe ke nishaan liye gaye or kaha gaya ye prakriya kaa hissaa he
 But at last i got the guards in the form of Kazi Anwar and Rakshanda Naz and came forward to fight my case
 unhone unheen corts main sabit kiya ki ye jasusi kaa maamla nahin he
 Eventually, i was sentenced to three years in prison for being a fake icard
 maine galati kii lekin uske liye bahut badi keemat chukaai
 And this was certainly not a step taken against any country
 main aisi kisi gatividhi main shaamil hone kii soch bhi nahin saktaa
 My lawyer rightly said that i was not involved in any anti-pakistan activity, so the sentence that was given would be very harsh
 sawaal-bharat aane par aapaki pehali pratikriya kya thi?hamid-pakistan main 2,232 din bitaane ke baad jab maine bharat lautaa to mere andar adrenelin hormone ufaan par tha
 It was a pleasure to set foot on the soil of our country
 mere parivaar or maine madar india ko jhuk kar or chuum kar shukr jataayaa
 Also thanked Allah for helping us to overcome this difficult period
 sawaal-ab aapkaa aage kya plan he?hamid-main vahiin se shuru karnaa chahta hum jahaan choda tha
 i will first find a job and then will fulfill my parents' desire to marry me
 apana parivaar shuru karuunga
 My family has made a lot of sacrifice and now is the time to live a normal life in peace
 main unhen dobaaraa khush karne ke liye unke saath khadey rahanaa chahta hum
 My brother refused to marry until i returned to India
 ab main chaahunga ki wo shaadi kare or apana parivaar basaae
 Just want my family's sacrifices not to go waste
 sawaal-us ladki ke saath kya hua, kya ye jaankaar hairaani hui?hamid-mere vakil ne mujhe apadet kiya ki us ladki kii shaadi ho chuki he or uskaa apana parivaar he
 i pray for the happiness of her wherever she is
 or ab main khud bhi nae sire se apni zindagi shuru karuunga jiske liye mujhe uuparavaale ne dobaaraa mauka diya he

 Chappell has spoken of making Kohli the captain at the earliest after India's poor performance on the recent tour of New Zealand as the team could not register a single win in any format on this tour
 chapel ne likhaa, ‘dhoni khel ke chote praaroop main shandaar captain he or madhyakram ballebaaj ke taur par uskaa pradarshan shandaar he
 But as a Test captain he reacts very quickly and takes the game in a direction where he himself does not know what to do next
 uski sthiti bageeche main tahal rahe ek bhramit professor jaisi ban jaati he
 "he said about the second match drawn against New Zealand," his conservatism gave much freedom to the best batsmen of the rival team and gave many easy runs

 Chappell said, "dhoni really should have been removed after England and Australia's disappointing tour of India in 2011-12, when his team lost eight consecutive matches
 ’ chapel ne kaha ki jab team majhadaar main hoti he to dhoni ranneeti banane main naakaam rahete hai
 He said, 'when the captain starts interrupting his team, he needs to change
 is kharaab daur main dhoni apni team ko prerit karne main asafal rahe or aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise captain bhaawanaaon se guzar rahaa tha
 There is no doubt that a captain should stay longer, until his team loses
 ’chapel ne kaha, ‘dhoni ne vaapasi kii jab usne gharelu maidan par australia ke khilaaf whitewash kiya
 There is no doubt that he is a better captain in such familiar circumstances

 The thousands of years old Swayambhu Jyotirlinga of Omkareshwar is rapidly eroding
 vajah bataai ja rahi he jalabhishek or chemical mili puja saamagree kaa istemaal
 Saints, priests and devotees are all sad
 padhein mushkil main padi aasthaa ke bare main ye story
 
 
 The thousand-year-old Swayambhu Jyotirlinga of Omkareshwar, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh, is eroding so fast that now its existence is under threat
 niraakaar swayambhu jyotirling ke ansh tuutakar gir rahe hai, lekin ise rokane ke koi gambhir prayaas ab tak nahin hue hai
 saint-mahatmas, pundits-priests and devotees are worried about this, but the government is not worried about it
 omkareshwar jyotirling main pehali baar jab varsh 1996 main shivlinga kaa ek tukdaa nikalakar alag hua, tab mandir prashasan kaa dhyaan is ore gaya
 Harisinh Chaudhary, chief executive officer of the temple, says, "since then, there have been complaints of small parts of the Jyotirlinga being eroded during the consecration ceremony
 '' bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ke ejiniers, orcyologist or export kii madad se 5 may, 2004 ko is par lep lagaakar sangrakshit kiya gaya
 With the intention to save it with water for at least one month
 jab shraddhaluon ko jyotirling par jalabhishek se roka gaya to khaasaa virodh hua or prashasan ne ek saptaah main hi roak hataa lee
 Since then, the corrosion has intensified
 bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ke assistant suparitendent ejeeniyar pankaj sharan kehete hai, ''samay se pehle pani daalane se treetment hi beasar ho gaya
 "sharan says that this jyotirlinga is of sand stone, on which it is collected by the offering of milk, panchamrit, flowers, belpatra, and rises in the jaladhari
 phir sadgaye se lactic acid banataa he, jisane ise kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 If it is to be saved from further erosion, then the Jalabhishek of Jyotirlinga will have to be stopped completely
 omkareshwar shaddarshan sant samaaj ke adhyaksh mahamandaleshwar swami vivekanand puri isse sahamat nahin hai
 He says, "the most damage to Jyotirlinga was caused by chemical coating
" varanaa yahaan to anadikaal se jalabhishek ho rahaa he
 "actually there was a lot of controversy in this case when the then Chief Executive Officer of the trust, Swami Tejanand, created a ruckus in the media on June 29, 2006 by making a statement that this Jyotirlinga had been broken
 isliye ise narmada main tirohit kar nayaa shivlinga sthapit kiya janaa chahie
 All the saints and priests got angry about this and the trust had to declare that this Jyotirlinga would be preserved
 managing trustee raav devendra singh kehete hai, ''jyotirling kabhi bhi khandit nahin hota
 It is not an idol
 yah niraakaar rup main prakat hue saakshaat bholenath hai
 "khandwa Collector Neeraj Dubey says," Everyone is worried about the erosion
 ab ise shastrokt tareeke se rokane ke upaay jaruri hai
 "in fact till now the Trust has taken superficial measures, which prohibited the first milk-panchamrit, flower on Jyotirling
 phir sidhe jalabhishek bhi
 Now the devotees pour water into the urn and pour it into a fiber tub and then a stream of water rises to Bholenath with a copper pipe
 kerala se yahaan darshan karne aae ramasvami dukhi man se kehete hai, ''na to bhagwaan ke thik se darshan ho paa rahe hai or na hi abhishek
