Responding to Sushil Modi's allegations, Tejashwi Yadav tweeted

 Tejashwi asked the question whether doing business is written in the name of Sushil Modi's father and grandfather? Tejashwine wrote that Sushil Modi, who is rumored by Nitishji's thief grace, is the Deputy Chief Minister but is ahead of other Modi in lying

 The Delhi High Court in a historic judgment has justified homosexual relations with mutual consent
 court ne apane faisle main ipisi kii dhara 377 ke us praavdhaan ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya he jisamen samalangikta ko aapraadhik mana gaya he
 The court is of the opinion that this provision is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution related to freedom to live
 court ke is faisle se samalangikon ke adhikaron ke liye ladane vaale sanghathanon kii jeet hui he vahiin un chrishchiyan carch se lekar kai duusare virgon ko maayusi haath lagi he jo samalangikta ko kanoonee jama die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 The court has given this decision on the application of an NGO named Naz Foundation
 naaz phanudation ne ipisi kii dhara 377 main samalanginkata ko aapraadhik qaraar dene sambandhi praavdhaan ko chunauti di thi
 After the court's decision, Anjali Gopalan, Director of the Foundation expressed happiness over this and said that this is the first step in the 21st century
 court ke faisle ke baad ab sabaki najar sarkaar ke kadam par hogi
 In fact, on the issue of homosexuality, the government has been in doldrums for a long time
 duniya ke kai deshon main samalangikta ko kanoonee manyata mili hui he
 While homosexuality was considered legal and socially wrong in India
 bataaya jaataa he ki grahamantri pi chidambaram bhi is praavdhaan ko khatm karne ke paksh main hai
 But before doing this, the central government is in favor of making amrai
 aise main court ke faisle ke baad is mudde par sarkaar ko koi naa koi kadam jald hi lenaa hoga

 unheen ne bataaya he ki aapane badi hui fis waapas le lee he
 Now forms can be filled in 250 and 500
 2000 nahin dene padenge
 i am writing this letter because it was written on Facebook that under your government the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission has increased the fees of the form
 to yahaan ke pathakon ko bataanaa zaruri he
 On the same day, it was known that you had expressed resentment knowing that it was not appropriate
 tabhi chaatro ne ummid jataai thi ki aap fis vruddhi waapas lenge
 The country's economy has collapsed
 janata aarthik chot se karaah rahi he
 You cannot even imagine the condition of people on the ground
 aise main 2000 rupee farm ke fis lenaa bhayanak kshtakaari tha
 i believe that not only Madhya Pradesh, but the condition of examination of government recruitments all over India, especially in Hindi regions, is very bad
 isamen sudhaar kii zarurat he
 His credibility should be such that no one can lift a finger

 ajam khan kii pairvi ke aage mulaayam singh yadav ne apane parivaar kii bhi ansuni kar di
 Ram Gopal Yadav was adamant on not giving tickets to Shafiqur Rahman Burke on the Sambhal seat
 unke saath ikbaal mahmud or anya cabinet mantri bhi lagaataar dabaav bana rahe the, lekin ajam khan ke ek ishaare ke baad sab kuch palat gaya
 Six months ago, Javed's ticket was given to this seat and Shafiqur Rahman Burke was made a candidate
 badale ghatnakram ke baad sanbhal seat par netaaon kaa siyaasi bantwaaraa netaaon ke chehron par bhi dikhaai de rahaa he
 Everyone is keeping silence on this issue, while happiness is being celebrated in the Burke camp
 tikat siyasat kii khichdi darasal us samay pakani shuru hui, jab november maah main shafikurrahman bark kii potee kii shaadi thi
 Cabinet Minister Azam Khan arrived at the ceremony
 tab bark bispi ke saansad the or loksabhaa ke liye unhen bispi kaa pratyaashee mana ja rahaa tha
 But it was from here that the rumor began to rejoin the SP
 isi bich bispi ne unka tikat kaat diya
 As his chances of joining SP increased further, Sambhal, who was his opponent, became active Cabinet Minister Iqbal Mehmood
 chunki yah asaar lagane lage the ki bark ko tikat mil saktaa he, isliye vah lakhanu tak apni baat pahunchaa chuke the ki bark factor se kya-kya dikkatein ho sakati hai
 Javed Ali had already been nominated to the Sambhal seat at the behest of Ram Gopal Yadav
 isliye vah bhi nahin chaahate the ki bark ko tikat diya jaae
 He also objected to Mulayam Singh
 ikbaal mahmud, shahid manjuur, ahamed hasan lakhanu main javed ke saath mulaayam singh se mili bhi the
 It is believed that an attempt was made not to give the ticket to Burke, but the whole exercise was defeated
 aakhirkaar ajam khan kii ek hami ne bark ko phir sapa kaa saathi bana diya
 After taking charge of the Ministry of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj has made an important statement on mutual relations with Pakistan

 Sushma said that India has asked Pakistan to ensure speedy proceedings in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks case
 maamle kii sunwaayee pakistan main ho rahi he
 The Pakistani side said that they are working on it
 sushamaa ne kaha ki modi ne dakshes (saarc) netaaon ke saath baatcheet kii, jo safal rahi
 Sushma said that Modi has told the SAARC leaders that due to bilateral issues, SAARC could not make a mark in the world
 unhone kaha ki yadi mahatvapurn dwipaksheeya masale sambandhit deshon par hi chhod die jaaen, to dakshes ek majboot takat ke rup main ubhar saktaa he
 He said, i would like to say that for the first time the SAARC leaders felt that such a government and a Prime Minister has taken power in India, who think out of the box
 ullekhneey he ki bharat ne mangalvaar ko pakistan ke saath uski sarajameen se failane vaali aatankwaadi hinsa par chintaa jataai or is mudde par pakistan se uski patibaddhtaon kaa paalan karne ke liye kaha
 However Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed that the foreign secretaries of the two countries would be in touch to consider ways to further the bilateral relationship
 donon netaaon kii mulaakaat ke bare main videsh sachiv sujatha singh ne media se kaha ki modi ne aatankwaad ke sambandh main bharat kii chintaa jataai
 He said that Pakistan should follow its commitment to stop terrorism from its land and its occupied territory
 modi ne ummid jataai ki mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke maamle main pakistan main mukademe kii gati tej karne ke liye or aropiyon ko dandit karaane ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae jaaenge

 When Kanhaiya Kumar was asked with whom your fight was, he said, 'our fight is with those who have done the work of humiliating the land of Begusarai
 hamaari ladaai sidhe taur par sarkaar se us mukhute se he jo kaam nahin karte hai jo sirf or sirf apane virodhiyon ko badnaam karne kaa kaam karte hai
 When Kanhaiya Kumar was asked how much the issue of nationalism would dominate in Begusarai, Kanhaiya said that 'there will be a direct message from Begusarai that people should have important questions in democracy

 The nation is made up of people, it is not made up of fake slogans misleading the nation
 shiksha, rojgaar, swasthya, bijli, pani, vikaas sabase ahm sawaal he

 It is alleged that six murders were carried out at his farm house in Penn, Raigad
 is murder mistry ko police ajtak nahin sulajhaa pai he
 However, this farm house Ranjith has now sold
 lekin shina cese kii charchaa ke dauraan sthaneey logon ke jahan main ye ghatana taaja ho gai he
 According to locals, three people were sensationally murdered in Ranjit's farm house in 1986 and 1992
 isamen maare gaye gagode gaanv ke rahane vaale moru patil kii pahchaan to ho gai, lekin baaki mritkon kii pahchaan ajtak nahin saki he
 The police investigation has also not been completed
 is murder mistry ne ek baar phir raigarh police par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 There were 6 people in the house in the farm, this farm house of Murdaranjit is located on the road of Gagode village on Pen Khopoli road
 1986 main yahaan kaam karne vaale teen logon kii hatya hui thi
 After this, in 1992 also three more people working in this farm house were killed with a knife
 is maamle main abhi tak kisi kii bhi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Nor has the police been able to solve this murder mystery
 tatkaaleen siem ne diya tha jaanch kaa bharosasmaj sevika vaishali patil ne bataaya ki is maamle main us vakt tatkaaleen siem manohar joshi ne jaanch kaa bharosa diya tha, lekin bharosa aaj tak vaastaviktaa main badal nahin paaya
 Now after solving the mystery of Sheena's murder, once again the villagers are expecting the police to investigate and disclose the case of murder in 1986 and 1992
 nae sire se jaanch main lagi raigarh pulicepulice kaa kahana he ki unke sangyaan main yah maamla aayaa he
 The investigation of the recovered body is accompanied by directions by the investigating officers of the case
 iske liye ek police adhikari ko jimmedaari bhi di gai he
 The police team is engaged in the investigation of this case
 bahut jald is cese ko sulajhaa liya jayega
 However, Vaishali claims that the SP closed the case even after the cm's order
 goa main aaj se bijepi rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak shuru ho rahi he or sabaki nigahen narendra modi par hai
 Everyone is waiting when the announcement will be made to hand over the command to Narendra Modi
 haalanki ise lekar bijepi ke bheetar hi matbhed bhi hai
 As much as the BJP high command has tried to resolve these differences, they have become increasingly confused
 sawaal yah he ki jo kahani 2002 main shuru hui thi, kya uski asal patakatha 2013 main likhi jaayegi? 2002 main bijepi ke rashtriya adhiveshan main bhi sawaal narendra modi hi the or 11 saal baad 2013 (goa adhiveshan) main bhi sawaal modi hi honge
 In 2002, there was a question whether Narendra Modi should step down as Gujarat CM for Rajdharma, in 2013 there is a question of handing over the command of 2014 to Modi
 2002 main to modi ke chaheton ne aisi bisaat bichaai ki modi kii gaddi barkaraar rah gai or mana yahi gaya ki 2002 main rajdharm kii haar hui or modi jeet gaye
 At the same time, in 2013, the red carpet for Modi has been laid in Delhi, but when Modi will run on it, Goa Adhivashan is starting in this way
 or sawaal ek baar phir modi hai
 The BJP was not able to digest the Gujarat riots during 2002, because the BJP was led by the NDA government at the center at the time, but in 2013, the BJP needs Modi's leadership because it wants to take power at the center
 yani jo modi 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke liye daag the, vahi modi 2013 main bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane ke liye turup kaa patta ban chuke hai
 Modi's command of the 2014 mission will increase the number of BJP mps, but the conflict within the BJP is that with the arrival of Modi, the seats increase but the power remains still
 yani bijepi ko un sahyogiyon kaa bhi saath chaiye jo ayodhya, kaaman civil code or dhara 370 ko thande baste main dalwakar bijepi ke saath khadey hue the
 So the question is that in 2002, the command was with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was teaching Modi the text of Rajagharma and in 2013 the BJP is going to ride Modi, where the new script of Modi's Rajgharma from Gujarat awaits everyone
 Someone is doing maujuuda daur main narendra modi isaliye goa se aage bhi bada sawaal ban chuke hai
 Regarding Modi, there is a question within the BJP, allies have been raising it again and again
 isliye modi par goa main kya ranneeti hogi, is par desh kii nigahen lagaataar bani hai
 In July last year, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack was releasing zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi to Pakistan and India objected to the move of the neighboring country to the United Nations
 china ne us vakt bhi yah kahkar maamla uljhaayaa tha ki pakistan kaa faisla 'tathyon or puri tarah nishpakshta' ke aadhaar par liya gaya he
 Along with this, Beasing had also said that he is constantly in touch with New Delhi
 bas kuch or dinon kii baat he
 There will be an amazing view outside the bungalow of the Mayor of Rajkot
 daravaaje par santari honge
 a train will leave to go to the Municipal Corporation

 Sentry will salute the first citizen of the city
 phir usee bangale se ek auto nikalegaa
 The sentry will also salute its driver as he is the husband of Mayor Sahiba
 unki roji roti he auto chalaanaa
 This fairy tale has become possible after the election of a BJP worker named Raksha Ben as Mayor
 raksha or unke pati raghubhai naarangabhai boliya pichley teen dashakon se party ke saath jude hai
 After the recent local body elections, Narendra Modi gave the name of Raksha as mayor
 rajkot kii nai meyar is gaurav ko party ke samanta ke siddhant se jodatii hai
 According to him, Narendra Modi showed that there is no difference between rich and poor in BJP
 hamaare jaise mehnat karne vaale kaaryakartaaon ko unke kaam kii pahchaan mili he
 Rakshi's husband also praises the party on this occasion
 raksha or raghu kii 1995 main shaadi hui
 Till now they lived in a two-room house
 magar jald hi parivaar meyar bangale main shift kar jayega
 Defense will get government car for use
 udhar raghu ghar chalaane ke liye auto chalaate rahenge

 Chidambaram tried to blame the Delhi Police (which reports to him) completely for this
 unhone kaha ki police ne dilli ko nishaanaa bana rahe kuch aatanki samoohon ke bare main july main muhaiyaa karai gai khufia jaankaree par karrwai nahin kii
 But his own Special Secretary (internal Security) Yu
 ke
 Bansal immediately cut it off, saying that intelligence was not clear
 rakshaatmak ravaiya apana rahe dilli police ke ek varisht adhikari ne us khufia jaankaree ko anaap-shanaap qaraar diya jise grih mantralay ne unase saajha kiya tha
 "on July 29, we were told that Sikh terrorists could attack if the death row convict and leader of the Khalistan Liberation Front, Devinder Singh Bhullar, were hanged," said the officer
 grih mantralay ne hamaare saath kuch saajha nahin kiya
 "but he had received enough warning
 dilli hycourt main beeti 25 may ko dhamaakaa kiya gaya tha, jise police ne gambhirthapurvak nahin liya kyonki usamen koi hataahat nahin hua tha
 Chidambaram took a defensive stand in Parliament
 unhone kaha, ''pichley kuch varshon main dilli police ko majboot banane ke kai upaay kiye gaye hai
 Despite the prepared capacity and the vigilance of the Delhi Police, a tragic incident happened today
 ''yahi nahin, yahaan tak ki khufia or jaanch agenciyaan, sabhi grih mantralay ko report karti hai, bhi koi aatanki hamalaa rokane yaa hone ke baad use sulajhane main naakaam rahi hai
 The Pune German Bakery blast in February 2010, for the first time since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has yet to be resolved although two arrests and a chargesheet have also been filed
 mumbai aties ko us samay kaaphi sharmindagi uthaani padi jab sunwaayee ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki mangalore se giraftaar ek abhiyukt abdul samad ne kabhi pune kaa daura nahin kiya
 It is often seen after the accidents that the police arrest some people or claim to be arrested and after a few days these people are released due to lack of evidence and it seems that after Khanapurti everyone is involved in these cases
 But forgets that as soon as an accident happens, the old wounds become fresh again, but it has been seen that for a few days, the police looks like they are
 uske baad ke dhamaakon-april, 2010 main bangaloru ke chinnaswami cricket stadium main dhamaake, sitambar, 2010 main jama masjid visphot se lekar disambar, 2010 main varanasi ke sheetala ghat par dhamaakaa or july, 2011 main mumbai main silsilewar dhamaake-ko bhi suljhaayaa nahin ja sakaa (dekhen box)
 Security expert Ajay Sahni says that if the system is not re-energized, more terror attacks will occur
 unka kahana he, ''desh kii aatankwaad virdohi vyavastha ab bhi bahut kamjor he or khufia jaankaree jutaney kii vyavastha gart main he
 a dedicated and competent intelligence gathering system is needed to fight terror
 ve kehete hai, ''ise aisa nahin banaaya janaa chahie ki jisamen log dhamaake kii khabar khatm hone ke baad sone chale jaaen
 "actually, the High Court blast is the biggest blot on Delhi Police records because it happened at the same place where the attack took place on 25 May
" police ne us ghatana kii yah kehete hue jaanch kii thi ki yah indian mujahidin (iem) kii karstani ho sakati he
 The Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) was demanding to increase security and it was decided to install X-ray machines and CCTV cameras
 ab diechasibie adhyaksh amarjit singh chandio kehete hai ki sisitivi camere ''raste main'' hai or eks-re mashine ''pahunchane hi vaali hai
 "A problem in the tender process delayed the purchase of essential safety equipment
" dilli police jaruri sisitivi kii sankhya badalati rahi
 At the same time, the terrorists repaired their explosive hardware and prepared for the latest blast
 ek suraksha visheshgy kaa kahana he, ''duniya main kahin bhi aatanki ek hi lakshya ko dobaaraa nishaanaa nahin banaate
 "the functioning of the blast in the High Court on 25 May, that was also on a Wednesday, was almost identical
" ek chote kaale thile main kareeb 2 kilo visphotak rakhaa gaya tha
 At that time, he was left at Gate No
 7, the backyard of the High Court, which is used by lawyers and litigants to park their vehicles
 vah bilkul sahi yojana thi lekin circuit kii kharabi kii vajah se sajeesh naakaam ho gai
 After Chidambaram, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also gave a rhetorical statement - "a cowardly act of terrorist nature" - he makes such a statement after every terrorist attack
 7 sitambar ko dopaher main kuch samachar channelon ko kathith taur par harakat-ul-jihad-al-islamic (ji)-pakistan or bangladesh main sthit ek aatanki sanghathan jiske modul bharat main sakriy hai-ne i-mail bhejkar dhamaake kii jimmedaari lee

 "our demand is that the punishment-a-death of Afzal Guru be abolished early or else we will target the High Court and the Supreme Court of India," the e-mail said
 ''8 sitambar ko dopaher main indian mujahidin ne kuch samachar madhyamon ko i-mail bhejkar kaha ki hycourt main ji ne nahin, usne visphot karaayaa he or jaldi hi ek shopping mal main visphot hoga
 But intelligence and investigative agencies are not getting any clue about the terrorist group
 sutron ne kaha ki jaanch agenciyaan pichley kuch visphoton se bhaunchak hai kyonki ve kisi bhi ek aatanki samooh ko doshi nahin tehra pai hai
 Now the strategy of blaming the head of IM is not working
 pichley aath pramukh hamalon main se paanch ke liye bina kisi aadhaar ke iem ko doshi tehraaya gaya
 Various investigative agencies periodically arrested "suspected IM activists"
 darasal, mumbai aties ne july, 2011 main do vyaktiyon ko iem kaaryakarta maanakar giraftaar kiya or yah tak spasht nahin kiya ki ve kisi aatanki hamale main shaamil the
 "intelligence is a clear indication that the indigenous group is guilty of doing so, which has nothing to do with IM," says an intelligence expert
 lekin uske bare main kuch or maaloom nahin he
 "the Ministry of Home Affairs says that the role of terrorists based in Pakistan also cannot be denied
 sutron ne kaha ki 17 sitambar ko noida main niraj naamak ek ladke ko pakistan se phone par dilli main bade dhamaake kii chetavanee mili thi, lekin samay or jagah ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya tha

 The country is celebrating the 70th anniversary of independence
 duniya ke sabase mahaan ganatantr main ham apni marji se jeene ke liye aaazaad hai
 But even today in a great country like India, basic facilities like better education, health, are beyond everyone's capacity
 jo samrudh he uske paas suvidhaayen behatar hai jo samrudh nahin he vah kisi tarah guzar basar karata he
 On the 70th anniversary of Independence, Delhi government schools have given freedom to thousands of parents living in the capital to take their children out of expensive private schools and give free education in modern shining government schools
 dilli main sarkari skulon kii haalat ab badalane lagi he
 On this Independence Day, the government schools of the capital have given the parents of Delhi the freedom to provide better education to their children for free
 dilli sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ab tak hajaaron bachche nijee skulon se naam katwakar sarkari skulon main daakhila le chuke hai
 Let's try to understand what is the reason behind this change
 yah dilli ke rohinee ilaake ke sector 21 main bana rajkeey sarvoday vidhyalay he
 In April this year, out of 18 newly constructed government schools, about 1200 children study in this school
 lekin jo tasviir sabase dilachasp he vah yah ki in 12 bacchon main se lagbhag 900 bachche vah hai jo april ke pehle tak rohinee or iske aasapaas ke ilaakon main bane nijee skulon main padhate the lekin is saal in 900 bacchon ne nijee skulon se naam katwakar sarkari skulon main daakhila liya he
 It sounds impossible to hear but the government schools in the capital have made this impossible
 nai shandaar imaarat kisi bhi nijee skool ko takkar detii he
 Modern class rooms and excellent facilities do not let these children realize that they now study in a private school or in the concept infamous government schools
 skool ke pradhanacharya dow sukhbir yadav ke mutabik lagbhag 900 bacchon ne is nae sarkari skulon main daakhila liya he jo ab tak nijee skulon main padhate the
 The government has given better schools and we are trying to provide better education in these schools
 nijee skulon jaisi unifarm uniform par bana logo sarkari skool main padhane vaale in bacchon ko bhi ek aatmavishvaas de rahaa he
 But it is also necessary to know the reason why this freedom is so important for the common man
 nijee skulon se sarkari skulon main daakhila lekar padhane vaale zyaadaatar chaatr kaa maananaa he ki nijee skulon dwaara lee jane vaali baari bharkam fees unke mata-pita ke liye sirdard bani thi
 But was the quality of studies of children compromised due to financial constraints? Most of the students agree in this way and say that they are getting the same clap in these government schools as in the previous schools
 schuli chaatr-chaatraon ne bataaya ki is skool main bhi hamen acchhee shiksha di ja rahi he
 Education is no less than in private schools
 khilne-kudane ke avasar bhi yahaan zyada milte hai
 In conversation, the Aaj Tak team also asked the students sitting in the history class of the history of the Rome Empire
 dekhie kaise chaatro ne jhatpat har sawaal kaa jawaab diya
 a new government school has been started in Rohini's Sector 22 from April this year
 primary se lekar 12veen tak ke sarkari skool main lagbhag 800 bacchon ne nijee skulon se naam katwakar daakhila liya he
 If we consider the figures of the Delhi government, in the new modern schools started this year, thousands of children have enrolled in government schools after cutting their names from private schools
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri or shiksha mantri manish sisodiya sarkari skulon main aane vaale in chaatro se bade khush hai
 The education minister says that he has tried to give children all the better facilities that even a private school cannot provide
 sarkari skulon main kranti laane ke kejariwal sarkaar ke daavon main kitni sachai he yah jaanane ke liye 'aaj tak' kii team pahunchi dilli ke ITO ilaake main bane rajkeey sarvoday vidhyalay main
 The Delhi government had said that it is working on making 54 government schools out of the existing government schools in Delhi in the first phase as model schools
 ITO par bana rajkeey sarvoday vidhyalay unheen model skulon main se ek he
 a magnificent building is seen welcoming as it crosses the school frame
 skool ke principal doctor devendra ne bhi bataaya ki unke skulon main bhi is saal kai bacchon ne nijee skulon se naam katwa kar unke is sarkari skool main daakhila liya he
 And here too, the biggest reason that emerged was the economic crisis faced by the middle class
 rajkeey vidhyalay, rouz avenue ke pradhanacharya doctor devendra ne kaha, "hamaare skulon main bhi kai bacchon ne nijee skulon se naam katwakar daakhila liya he
 The expensive fees of private schools were difficult for many parents
 lekin usase bhi jaruri he sarkari skulon main vah behtareen suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karana jo sarkaar kar rahi he or ham un suvidhaon ke saath behtareen or aadhunik shiksha dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 "parents kneeling in front of expensive fees of private schools, have written the names of children in government schools, but is this freedom of free education not expensive for their children? The answer to this question is not just the building of this school but its classroom Give
 baithne ke liye fibre kii shandaar bench or padhaane ke liye smart board or computer projector dekh kar lagata he ki jaise kisi IIT yaa ai ai em ke class room main baithe hon
 There are also modern gyms for exercise and special painting class to enhance the talent
 aadhunik shikshake liye sabase jaruri computer shiksha ke liye bhi vishesh classroom he jahaan projector ke jariye bacchon ko computer sikhaaya jaataa he
 This school also has a complete guide course for skill development education and special classrooms for it
 dilli kii ek hajaar se zyada sarkari skulon main lakhon bachche padhate hai
 Prosperous families mostly enroll their children in expensive private schools because the concept of government schools is not right in the society
 aazaadee ke 70 saal bitne ke baad bhi swasthya or shiksha ko lekar har aam aadmi ko shaayad behtareen suvidhaon kiazadiab tak nahin mil pai he
 Delhi has shown a way and even the least-income middle class is getting that freedom in the matter of excellent education
 star khilaadiyon se saji team india world cap ke varrup match main newjiland ke khilaaf 6 wicket se maat kha gai
 The defeat against the Kiwis has come as a shock to the hopes of the Virat Brigade, who dream of winning the World Cup
 is haar se bhartiya team kii taiyaariyon kii pole khul gai
 Team India was not able to start as expected
 ye to rabindra jadeja the, jinke ardhashatak (54 ran) kii badaulat bharat 150 ke paar ja pai
 Team India 39
 2 over main 179 ran par olout ho gai or newjiland ko 180 kaa target mila
 It was difficult for India to go for 100 runs at one time but Ravindra Jadeja scored 54 runs off 50 balls to save the team's shame
 isamen kuldeep yadav (19) ne bhi unka acha saath diya
 Let's take a look at the reasons behind the defeat of Team India: 1
 rohit or dhawan kaa fail hona:is match main bharat kii shuruyaat behad kharaab rahi
 What was worrying the Indian batsmen was proved right in the practice match
 trent bolt kii swing ke saamne bhartiya ballebaaj naachte rahe
 It started with Rohit Sharma (2) who lbw to Bolt
 shikhar dhawan (2) bhi bolt kaa shikaar bane
 Bolt sent Rohit, Shikhar and Rahul to the pavilion in their first spell which proved decisive in a cloudy season
 ballebaajon main footwork kii kami saaf dikhi
 Bolt dismissed Rohit on a great swing while Dhawan returned to the pavilion with a bouncing ball on the inside of the bat
 2
 Virat Kohli's dismissal: Captain Virat Kohli (18 off 24 balls) was dismissed by an off cutter by Colin de Grandhom
 grandehome kii gend par kohli gachha kha kar bold ho gaye
 If Kohli was standing at the crease, the picture could have been different
 kohli ke out hone ke baad dabaav middle order par aa gaya
 3
 nahin chale dhoni or pandya:madhyakram ladkadaane ke baad dhoni or pandya krij par the
 Hardik Pandya (30 off 37 balls) added 38 runs for the fifth wicket with Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni (42 gend main 17 ran) kii pari tim soudi ne samaapt kii, vah short mid wicket par kaich out hue
 He did not look comfortable at the crease and also failed to rotate the strike during the partnership
 jimi nisham (teen over main 26 ran dekar teen wicket) ne hardik pandya kaa wicket jhatka
 Given the circumstances, Hardik was sent to bat before Dhoni
 4
 Bowler's flop show: Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar and Shami could not do anything special on the pitch on which the New Zealand bowlers did not give the Indian batsmen even a chance to set foot
 yahi haal spin gendbaajon kaa bhi rahaa
 Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor shared 114 runs to dismiss Team India from the match

 According to sources, the terrorists are being instructed by ISI from pok to target the army camp and mobile communication tower located in Jammu and Kashmir

 main apane chaaron ore bahut saare niyam-kaayade, kanoon dekhtaa hum
 Don't do this, don't do that, can't do this, you can do this, they can't do this
 
 
 kahaan hai in niyamon ko banane vaale? main unase poochna chahta hum ki inamen main kyon nahin shaamil hum? haa, jaanata hum ki kuch niyam kanoon mere liye bhi hai
 But then a question as to why he is so innocent? Why are people like me ineffective? Election-winning leaders and governments can boast of their victory, be complacent, but will have no answer to my questions when they explore their conscience
 bade-bade bhaashan vir niruttar rahenge
 Maybe my days have passed but you still have a chance
 aane vaali un pidiyon kii phikr kar lo, jo meri hi tarah sabase pichhali qatari main khadi hokar tumse sawaal karegi
 And if you could not change yourself, then at that time your lips will be stitched
 philhal ke liye tumhen tumhaara bal diwas mubarak ho

 When Rakesh Singh, MP of Jabalpur Lok Sabha constituency, was made the new state president of the BJP on April 18, it became clear that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has succeeded in getting the voice of the party high command based in Delhi
 rajya ke purv party pramukh nandkumar singh chouhan kaa janaa tabhi "tay lagane'' laga tha, jab haal main mungawali or kolaras ke vidhansabha upachunaavon main party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Now Rakesh Singh's arrival in this post shows that the saffron leadership is not willing to take any risk in the crucial election year
 unka chayan isliye bhi myne rakhata he kyonki is pad ke liye rajya ke kareeb aadha darjan netaa lobying kar rahe the, jinamein rajya ke mantri narottam mishra or laal singh arya tath purv kendriya mantri fagan singh kulaste shaamil the
 Apart from these, National General Secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and former Union Minister Prahlad Patel were also in the race, but due to strong relations with the Chief Minister, it was not possible to consider the names of these people
 isse bhi pataa chalata he ki party alaakaman philhal mukhyamantri ko kitni tavajjo de rahaa he
 It is said that Chief Minister Chauhan was keen to bring Narendra Singh Tomar to the post for the third time
 tomars-chouhan kii jodi 2008 or 2013 ke do chunaavon main vijayi rahi thi
 Tomar is currently the Minister for Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Mining Department at the Center and there is a buzz in the corridors of power that he refused
 lekin mukhyamantri unhen khona nahin chaahate the
 So, he assured that Tomar should also remain as a convenor in the BJP state election committee and strengthen the party's prospects with his advice
 party ke nae adhyaksh rakesh singh ko pehla bada brake uma bharti ne apane mukhyamantri kaarykaal ke dauraan diya tha
 He supported his candidature from Jabalpur Lok Sabha seat in 2004

 haalanki rakesh singh ke aalochakon kaa kahana he ki chunaav ke mahaj kuch maheene pehle unhen laae jane kaa koi matlab nahin he, kyonki ab kaaphi der ho chuki he
 It is also being said that apart from the innings of the co-incharge of Maharashtra BJP, Rakesh Singh has no other organizational experience
 phir pradesh main party main jitne dhade ho gaye hai, unhen ekajute rakh paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Therefore, many goals are ready for them, the first of which will be to identify the seats whose current mlas have to cut the cards
 nae pradesh bhaajapa mukhiya ko is maamle main thodi sakriyata dikhaani hogi taaki is saal ke ant main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke tikat vitaran main kam se kam baghawat ho
 The new chairman will have to learn to work in some free manner, rather than the chief minister becoming "horny"
 unhone babulal gaur or sartaaj singh jaise varishton kaa khyaal rakhaa he
 Indicating that they know what to do

 Huh

 Today another statement came, but it is the responsibility of the Chief Minister and the UP government to make false statements and false propaganda about law and order
 unnav main rape peedita ko jinda jalaakar maar dene kii ghatana par pichley 4 ghanton ke andar priyanka gandhi wadra ne 2 twit karte hue sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa he

 galle main karaari shikast ke baad bharat ke liye 26 july se shuru ho rahe duusare test main vaapasi karnaa aasaan nahin hoga kyonki use colombo ke us sinhalaij sports club (esayssi) maidan par khelnaa he jo srilanka kaa garh rahaa he
 Defeating Sri Lanka on the SSC ground is akin to climbing Everest and this can be gauged from the record of the hosts on this ground, who have won 17 of the 33 Tests played here, while losing only six
 duusari taraf galle main kumaar sangakaara kii team ke haathon das wicket se shikast jhelane vaali team india ke liye yah maidan bhaagyashaalee nahin rahaa he
 India has played six Tests here, winning only one of them, while losing two matches
 teen match barabari par chute
 Sri Lanka had washed away India by an innings and 239 runs in the last match between the two teams here in July 2008
 yah maidan srilanka ke ballebaajon ko kaaphi bhaataa he lekin galle test ke saath sanyas lene vaale mahaan spinner muthaiya muralidharan kaa nahin khelnaa bharat ke liye raahat kii baat hogi jo is maidan par ballebaajon ke liye abujh paheli sabit hue hai
 He has taken 166 wickets in only 24 matches at this ground, which is the record for the most wickets of a bowler on any one field
 jahir khan or es srisanth jaise anbhavi gendbaajon ke chotil hone ke baad kamjor gendbaaji ke kaaran bharat ko apane ballebaajon se behatar pradarshan kii ummad hogi jo gaale main apekshaaon par khare nahin utar paye the
 Fans will be hoping that Virender Sehwag, the only Indian batsman to score a century in the first Test, will be able to plague the Sri Lankan bowlers while maintaining his rhythm in the SSC as well
 bhartiya team ko haalanki pehle test se purv behtareen farm main chal rahe sahvaag ke salaami jodidar gautam gambhir ke lay main lautne kii ummid hogi jo pehle test main do or shunya ran kii paariyaan hi khel paye
 He was dismissed by fast bowler Lasith Malinga, who returned to Test cricket in both innings
 iske alaava bharat kii ummiden duniya ke sabase safal ballebaaj sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana, rahul dravid or mahendra singh dhoni par bhi tiki hogi
 Tendulkar scored 84 in four matches here, scoring 84 runs in the second innings in Galle
 50 kii behtareen ausat ke saath 495 ran banaaye hai jabaki dravid ke naam itane hi maichon main 30
 211 runs are recorded at an average of 14
 is maidan par bharat ke pichley match main ardhashatak banane vaale ekmaatr ballebaaj lakshmana ne gaale main duusari pari main 69 ran kii dharypurna pari kheli thi or vah esayssi main apane pradarshan main sudhaar karnaa chahenge jabaki yuvaraj or dhoni se bhi is baar srilankai gendbaajon ke khilaaf behatar taiyaari ke saath utarane kii ummid he
 India's bowlers, however, will have to deal with Sri Lanka's strong batting once again
 mejabaan team ke chotii ke ballebaajon ko yah maidan kaaphi bhaataa he
 Former captain Mahela Jayawardene scored 54 from 22 matches here
 39 kii ausat se sarvaadhik 2467 ran banaaye hai jabaki captain sangakaara ne 17 maichon main 66
 Has 1603 runs with a best average of 79
 pehle match main vifal rahe tilan samarvira ne 13 maichon main 76
 Has scored 1153 runs at an average of 86, while aggressive opener Tillakaratne Dilshan has scored 646 runs in 11 matches
 iske alaava pehle test main shatak jadne vaale dilashaan ke salaami jodidar taranga paranvitana ek baar phir apane balle kaa jalawaa dikhaane ko betaab honge
 India may have breathed a sigh of relief from Muralitharan's retirement in bowling but Rangana Herath and Malinga, the first Test man of the match, would be ready to plague India once again
 herath ne esayssi main chah maichon main 22 jabaki malinga ne itane hi maichon main 20 wicket chatkaye hai
 After Murali's retirement, mystery bowler Ajanta Mendis is expected to make a place in the team who played a key role in Sri Lanka's win in the last match played here against India
 unhone tab donon chaariyon main chaar-chaar wicket chatkaye the
 Indian bowling, however, is a matter of concern
 pehle test srilanka ne ballebaajon ko mehmaan team ke gendbaaj pareshaan karne main safal rahe
 The team's most experienced bowlers Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha were unable to take a single wicket in the match, while Ishant Sharma and Abhimanyu Mithun also failed on the opening day of the first match
 esayssi vaise bhi harbhajan ke liye bhaagyashaalee nahin rahaa or vah yahaan teen match main keval saat wicket le paye hai

 punjab ke moga jile ke ajitwaal gaanv kii baat he
 On 8 December 2006, Navjot Sidhu stood up to speak at the Shiromani Akali dal-bjp rally here, completely engulfed
 cricketer or tivi ke hansod se siyasatdan bane siddhu ne apane shandaar bhaashan se 20 acre ke pandal ke baahar tak faili bheed par jaadu-sa kar diya
 The 'sidhuvani' of the Chutili utterances for which he is famous, his unmatched songs were filled in it
 20 minute ke bhaashan ke baad bheed main kisi or ko sunne kaa dhairya nahin rahaa, yahaan tak ki bujurg prakaash singh badal ko bhi nahin, jinaki 80veen saalagirah par yah raily yojit thi, or sukhbir badal ko to katai nahin
 As soon as Sidhu's speech ended, the crowd began to retrench
 isse badal pita-putr ko sharmindagi jhelni padi
 But Sidhu Pursukun was seen sitting on the stage
 chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahe punjab main sattadhari esaidi-bijepi gathbandhan, jise lagaataar do kaarykaal kii apni sarkaar ke khilaaf satta-virdohi rujhaan kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, or karishmai netacaptain amarinder singhki aguai main phir se ubharne kii ummid kar rahi congress—donon maanati hai ki is purv salaami ballebaaj main aisa bahut kuch he jisase unhen darane kii jarurat he
 Sidhu increased the nervousness of the BJP, the Akali Dal and the Congress, if he could retain even a little of the popular attraction he introduced as an MP from Amritsar, then on July 18, the dramatic resignation of the Rajya Sabha as a nominated member of the BJP His decision in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) after the verdict may change the course of the Punjab elections
 isse na keval esaidi-bijepi yaa congress kii mushkilen badhengi, balki arvind kejariwal kii 'rashtriya' falak par chaane kii mahatvakanksha main nai jaan aa jaaegi
 "from the news that Sidhu is coming to our party, there was a wave of enthusiasm among the party workers across Punjab," says Chander Suta Dogra, a former journalist and now in the aap's core team in the state
 ''siddhu siyasat main apane agle mukaam ko lekar khaase chaukanne rahe hai, par aap ke netaa aisa koi sankoch yaa hill-hawala pradarshit nahin kar rahe hai
 Sanjay Singh, the top AAP officer in Delhi, was among the first to say that Sidhu would be part of the party's war in Punjab
 jaldi hi manpreet randhaava (naukari chhodkar aap se judye vaale punjab ke darjan bhar patrakaron main se ek) ne isaki tasdik kar di
 He said, "it is only a matter of time before he formally joins the party
" ''siddhu ko sahi vakt kaa intjarudhar amritsar, jise siddhu ne 2004 main patiala se aakar apane siyaasi gruhakshetra ke taur par chunaa tha or 2014 messrun jetlike haq main seat khaali karne ke liye majaboor kiye jane se pehle jisaki unhone 11 saal tak loksabhaa main numaaindgi kii thi, main khushi or ummid dikhaai detii he
 a longtime supporter in Amritsar says, "sheri (sidhu's surname) is waiting for the right time
" ve yah jhalak nahin dena chaahate ki ve betaab hai
 "this supporter of Sidhu has little doubt that the former cricketer will join AAP and will also be the face of the cm's post in Punjab from the party
" siddhu ke samarthak 'spasht' sanketon kii ore bhi ishaara karte hai
 He points out that Sidhu came to the press conference on July 25 wearing a turban which is the identity of AAP, which gives the address of his intentions
 yah bhi kisi kii najar se nahin chhip saki ki maujuuda monsoon satr ke pehle din 18 july ko jab ve istipha saunpane sansad gaye, tab bhi unhone vahi pagadi pahan rakhi thi
 Most political analysts are convinced that you are the most suitable option for them
 yahaan tak ki unki patni navjot cor bhi yah baat khulkar kubul karti hai
 But even then, it may not be the final decision yet
 siddhu ke rajyasabha se istipha dene ke baad 19 july ko khudkejarivalki pratikriya ko hi lijie, ''
 
 
 i admire their courage
 ve achche aadmi hai
 i am of the opinion that all good people should resign from BJP
 philhal isse zyada kuch nahin he
 They have not come with us yet
 agar koi aap main shaamil hona chahta he, to unhen pehle aam aadmi bananaa padegaa
 It is too early to say anything
 kuch bhi tay nahin hua he
 "how much benefit will AAP get from Sidhu? Kejriwal made his statement very carefully
 iske peeche jahiraa taur par iraadaa yah tha ki agar punjab ke party netritv ke man main dur-dur tak charchit is kadam ko lekar koi shaq-subahaa rahaa ho to vah dur ho jaae
 While the party is sure to get the benefit of this former cricketer, there is a strong rebuttal with enthusiasm all around, that his arrival is not a problem that Sidhu is projected as the face of aap's Chief Minister
 Be done
 yah baat rajya ke ek se zyada bade party ohadedaar kah rahe hai
 Each of them probably has their own ambitions
 aap ke punjab sanyojak or purv akali mantri succha singh chhotepur, jo party ke sabase zyada dikhaai dene vaale punjabi chehre hai, sangrur ke loksabhaa sadsy balavant singh maan or party kii ghoshnaptr samiti ke mukhiya purv patrkaar kanvar sandhu, sabhi ne in afvaahon ko khaarij kar diya ki siddhu party ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar honge
 While Sandhu warned that if this happened, it would have an 'adverse effect on the morale' of the AAP workers, Chhotepur was upset, saying, "if Sidhu comes to the party, he will not contest elections
" ''AAP ke siem ummidavaar par sawalparty kii pravaktaa dogra jor dekar kahati hai, ''mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar pesh karne kii to abhi koi baat bhi nahin he
 At the moment, our focus is on the election campaign, creating a good and favorable agenda for the people
 '' aap ke kai bade netaa bataate hai ki party kisi chehre ke bagaiyr hi samarpit kaaryakartaaon kii fouj or aadhaar taiyaar karne main kaamyaab ho gai he, or isliye kisi ko pesh karne kaa koi dabaav nahin hona chahie
 However, the party spokesperson admitted that Sidhu, who perfectly matched aap's 'thinking', would be a complete weapon against the Badal family
 ve party ko jat-sikh cheharaa to denge hi jisaki use behad darkaar he, saath hi ve vyapak punjabi matadaataaon main aap kii apil ko failaane main bhi shandaar tareeke se samarth honge
 But there is also a second opinion
 chandigarh ke institute of deveopment and communication ke diarector pramod kumaar kehete hai, ''siddhu se aap ko koi phayda nahin hoga, jaisaa ki uchhaala ja rahaa he
 He has closely observed the politics of Punjab for three decades
 ve kehete hai, ''unki jo bhi apil he vah kamedian or tivi host ke taur par he
 "and also that they are yet to be tested outside Amritsar (where they had defied the 'infamous' faces of Congress)
" pramod siddhu main siyaasi vichaardhaara ke prati patibaddhta kii kami par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 He says, "it is a great thing to abuse mainstream political leaders and raise slogans against corruption and the evil of drugs
" par unke paas aisi kisi yojana kaa saboot dikhaai nahin detaa ki ve inase aakhir kaise niptenge
 "whatever happens in the coming months, Sidhu has definitely created a furore both inside and outside you
" sutara bataate hai ki punjab congress ke mukhiya amarinder singh bhi siddhu ko lubhaane main jute hai
 "he (sidhu) is a good boy," Amarinder told India Today on July 26
 '' unhone siddhu ke liye hakeekat main laal kaaleen bichaate hue kaha, ''hamaara bada purana rishta rahaa he
 His mother Nirmal Bhagwat Kaur contested on Congress ticket twice, while his father Harbhagwan Sidhu worked with the Congress government in 1980 as advocate-general
 ''mufeed grah nakshatron kaa intjarphilhal punjab main intjaar kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Close experts claim that Sidhu will eventually join AAP and that he is only waiting for 'mufid Graha Nakshatras'
 aap kii khatir ummid kerani chahie ki ve bahut der hone tak chhakaayenge nahin

 mansoor ali khan nawab pataudi ke rup main bhartiya cricket ne guuruuvaar ko ek jabanj insaan, pratibhashali khilaadi or doordarshee captain kho diya
 Pataudi, popularly known as 'tiger', took his last breath on Thursday evening at Sir Gangaram Hospital
 vah fefde ke gambheer sankraman se peedit the
 He was 70
 pataudi un chand khilaadiyon main se ek rahe hai, jinhone sabase pehle cricket or bollywood ke bich sidhaa rishta kaayam kiya
 Pataudi, who married the famous actress of his time, Sharmila Tagore, through his father, Nawab Pataudi Sr
, lived in cricket from childhood to youth, more than his actress wife, actor son Saif Ali Khan and daughter Soha Ali Khan
 Realized Bollywood through
 pataudi ko bhartiya cricket kaa doordarshee captain mana jaataa he
 That is why Pataudi, who started his Test career in 1961 and accepted the captaincy responsibility, played a total of 46 matches and led the team in 40
 apane chauthe hi test match main captain banaae jane vaale pataudi ko bhartiya cricket kaa sabase acha captain kaha jaae to galat nahin hoga
 Pataudi was made captain at the age of 21 against the West Indies in Barbados in 1962 as regular captain Nari Contractor was undergoing treatment at the hospital due to injury to a ball from pace bowler Charlie Griffith
 is tarah pataudi ko bhartiya cricket kaa sabase yuva captain banane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua
 His record remained till 2004
 county club sasex or oxford vishvavidhyalay team kii captaini kar chuke pataudi kii ek aankh kii roshni durghatana main chali gai thi lekin nakli aankh ke baavjood pataudi ne kabhi bhi kisi str par hathiyaar nahin daalaa or bhartiya cricket kaa vilakshan, buddhijivi or doordarshee cheharaa bane rahe
 The Indian team won a total of nine Tests under Pataudi's supervision
 vah unka hi kaarykaal tha, jab bhartiya team ko yah yakeen ho chalaa tha ki vah bhi jeet hasil kar sakati he
 It was very much like Sourav Ganguly's captaincy, when the Indian team defeated all the teams at home and abroad
 pataudi ne bhartiya cricket ko uski sabase badi takat spin kala par ashrith hone kaa aatmavishvaas diya
 Pataudi believed that Indian spinners could smack any team and that is why they promoted a policy of feeding more than one spinner in a match
 bataur ballebaaj pataudi ne bahut badi uplabdhi to hasil nahin kii lekin ek captain ke taur par unhone jis str kaa preranadai kaam kiya, use dekhte hue unke aankade or bhi prabhaavshaalee dikhte hai
 Pataudi scored 34 in 46 Tests
 91 ke ausat se 2793 ran banaae, jinamein chah shatak shaamil hai
 The 203 runs he scored against England in Delhi in 1964 remained his highest score
 oxford jaise pratishthit shikshan santhaan main padhe pataudi main shaleen kul ke sabhi gun the
 He was the Nawab of Pataudi located close to Haryana till 1971
 1971 main jab bharat sarkaar ne samvidhan main sanshodhan ke jariye rajgharaanon kii shakti bhang kar di tab tak pataudi kaa sammaan raja kii tarah hota tha lekin iske baad pataudi ne cricket ke madhyam se bhartiya janamanas par raaj kiya

 Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has reacted strongly to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's refusal to implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the central government in Delhi
 harshavardhan (harsh Vardhan) ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ko patr likhakar unke is faisle par dukh jataayaa he
 Harsh Vardhan wrote in his letter that i was very pained to see that you responded to my request to implement Ayushman Bharat scheme on social media
 isse pataa chalata he ki aap dilli ke logon ke bhale main bahut kam dilchaspee rakhte hai
 Your claim that the Delhi government is already providing free health services to all and therefore the people of Delhi do not need the Ayushman Bharat scheme, is completely wrong
 harshavardhan (harsh Vardhan) ne aage likhaa ki aapaki badi-badi yojanaayen bhi sade chaar saal guzar jane ke baavjood lagu nahin ho saki hai
 Even your Mohalla clinic is a complete flop
 main aapako bataanaa chahta hum ki sabhi rajya yah daawa kar sakate hai ki vah sarkari aspataal ke jariye muft swasthya sevaayen de rahe hai jabaki sachai yah he ki nagarikon ko abhi bhi apni jeb se us muft treetment ke liye paise dene padate hai
 While the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana covers 15% of the population of Delhi i
e
 30 lakh people
 mukhyamantri ji aap ne kaha ki jo log rupee 1 xxrep 4 0 se kam kamaate hai har maheene sirf vahi log isamen kabar hote hai jabaki yah nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam he
 Let me tell you that this is based on the data collected in Criteria 2011 wherein it was found that people earning less than Rs 10,000 per month need it most
 kendriya swasthya mantri harshavardhan ne aage likhaa ki rajya sarkaar kii prastaavit yojana jo ki mere hisaab se abhi bhi kaagajon par he usamen garibon par koi khaas dhyaan nahin diya gaya or muft swasthya seva ke zyada phaayde amir parivaar hi le paa rahe hai
 Kejriwal ji, your tenure is about to end, so you are bombarding a strange plan to fool the public in view of the assembly elections which can never be implemented
 main aapako aamantrit karata hum ki aaie dilli kii janata ke bhale ke liye or desh ke liye is aitihaasik yojana kaa hissaa bane
 Significantly, a few days ago, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had questioned the Centre's Ayushman plan and refused to implement it in Delhi
 unhonen desh ke swasthya mantri harshavardhan ko ek chitthee likhi thi
 Arvind Kejriwal, through a letter, questioned the scheme and asked why the Ayushman scheme came to Delhi's hospitals for treatment when it is applicable in haryana-uttar Pradesh
 iske alaavaadilli ke mukhyamantrineye bhi daawa kiya tha ki centre kii yojana main jahaan sarkaar batch 5 lakh kaa kharch uthaati he vahiin duusari taraf dilli sarkaar kii yojana main 30 lakh tak kaa kharch sarkaar uthaati he
 Arvind Kejriwal wrote in his letter that the objective of both the Delhi and Central Government schemes is to provide health facilities to the people
 unhone likhaa tha ki dilli main pehle se chal rahi swasthya yojana ko band kar duusari yojana lagu karne se kisi kaa phayda nahin hoga
 If the Delhi Health Scheme is discontinued and implemented in Ayushman Bharat, then lakhs of Delhiites will be lost
 arvind kejariwal ne kendriya swasthya mantri se chitthee ke madhyam se kaha tha ki, 'agar aapaki (harshavardhan) najar main ayushmaan bharat main koi aisi baat he jo dilli kii swasthya yojana main nahin he to kripaya bataaie
 We will include all those good things in Delhi's plan
 ' a former Union Minister has filed a complaint with the police about threatening phone calls
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki aarif mohammad khan ne hauj khaas police thane main subah shikaayat darj karaate hue kaha ki unhen kal raat dhamkee bhare kai phone aae
 He told, 'khan told us that he received many threatening calls from the same number
 phone karne vaale ne unase apshabd kahe or unhen dhamkee di
 He said that the caller told Khan that he would not be able to see the morning sun
 haalanki, unki shikaayat ke baad police ne is number par phone kiya, lekin vah band mila

 As much as things change in politics, they remain in their original form
 ye sach bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal united ke adhyaksh nitish kumaar se behatar koi nahin jaanata jo pichley 5 dinon se centre ke sarkaar main hissedari ko lekar surkiyon main hai
 However, he reiterates one thing every day that he is in the NDA and if he does not get a stake in the central government, it will not have any adverse effect on the government with the BJP in Bihar and also in the Center and Bihar Will remain in NDA only
 lekin vartmaan vivaad or sankat kaa kya samaadhaan hoga uske liye nitish kumaar kii raajnneeti ko 25 saal pehle se dekhnaa hoga
 What happened at that time will be well remembered by many senior leaders of Bihar BJP like Sushil Modi and Nand Kishore Yadav
 satta main hissedari kaa hi maamla tha ki jab nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav se alag hokar lok samta party banaayi thi
 It is known to everyone that the issue of making Lalu Yadav the leader of the opposition or Nitish Kumar played an important role in making him the Chief Minister of Bihar
 shaayad isi kaa asar tha ki shuru main ek do saalon tak party ke str par yah sarkaar ke faislon main lalu yadav nitish kumaar kii baton ko mahatv dete the
 Nitish used to run in the government
 lekin adwani kii giraftaari ke baad jab lalu yadav ko is baat kaa andaaza hua ki unki apni lokapriyata ke kaaran party kaa janaadhar bad rahaa he or satta main unhen koi chunauti nahin de saktaa
 Then Lalu Yadav started ignoring Nitish Kumar's words and even came to the point that even in the appointment of officers in his home district, Lalu Yadav started to make his own choice
 iskaa asar yah hua ki nitish kumaar ko bhi lagane laga ki lalu ab satta apni marzi se chalaanaa chaahate hai or hissedari to bilkul hi nahin dena chaahate hai
 This was one of the reasons that later became the most effective reason for the establishment of the Samata Party, among other issues
 lekin 25 saal baat shaayad nitish kumaar ko is baat kaa andaaza bhi nahin hoga ki aisi hi paristhiti ek baar phir unke saamne aegi
 When he will ignore his formula to make his party minister in the central government
 kyonki is baar centre main bijepi ko prachand bahumat mila he or kendriya mantrimandal main sankethik pratinidhatv kaa ek nayaa formula diya
 Under which one member of each associate was given a place in the cabinet
 yah baat alag thi kisi ko cabinet to kisi ko rajya mantri kaa darja diya ja rahaa tha
 Nitish had two options: to silently nominate one member of his parliamentary party to take oath or to make public his disagreement and to wait till the time he had another member in the cabinet
 Can not be found
 nitish ne doosraa vikalp chunaa or iske peeche unke thos kaaran the
 In order to win the NDA which has got 39 seats in Bihar, he held close to 171 electoral meetings, more than half of his allies including all 17 candidates of BJP and all six candidates of Lok Janshakti Party held more than 1 in the constituency
 iske alaava nitish kumaar ne gathbandhan dharm kaa nirvaah karte hue apni party kaa menifesto bhi keval isi aadhaar par jari nahin kiya kyonki media vivaadaaspad muddon jaise dhara 370, citijanship bill par bijepi se alag unke party ke stand par zyaada sawaal karti
 Against this backdrop, Nitish may not have had any idea that he would not even consider his formula for proportional representation
 haalanki bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad koi ye pehla mauqaa nahin hai ki nitish ko bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ne is baat kaa ahsaas karaayaa he ki unki har baat or maang nahin maani jaayegi
 Earlier, Prime Minister Modi rejected the demand of giving the status of Central University to Patna University publicly from the same platform
 iske alaava vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada khud narendra modi ne bihar ke purniya ke ek sabha main kiya tha use bhi thande baste main daal diya
 How many times Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi has said from public platform that it is no longer possible to accept this demand
 nitish kumaar ne bihar main sharabbandi kii lekin pados ke do bijepi shasit rajya jharkhand or utar pradesh main unki maang ke baavjood bhi sharabbandi nahin hui
 Due to which both these states are the main sources of illegal liquor in Bihar
 filhal hissedari nahin milane ke baavjood bihar main sarkaar ko koi khatara nahin he
 Because the ease and proper manner in which the people of Bihar BJP have experience of running the government with Nitish Kumar was a bitter experience with the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 kyonki ek lalu yadav kaa samanaantar hastkshep bahut hota tha or doosraa jab hissedari ke naam par jo suchi adhikariyon kii lalu yadav bhejte the usamen adhikansh daagi yaa vivaadaaspad chhavi ke log hote the isliye ve vartmaan paristhiti main nitish kumaar kaa rishta jahaan bihar BJP ke sahyogiyon ke saath khaas kaa mantrimandal ke sahyogiyon ke saath saamaanya hoga vahiin BJP ke kendriya netritv ke prati jo avishvaas kii sthiti bani he use agar jald suljhaayaa nahin kiya to bhavishya main kaa asar bihar ke kaamkaaj par bhi dikhegaa
 Presently, the work of journalists in Patna has increased due to the fact that now everything has to be kept watchful
 uske donon paksh milakar ek sur se 'ham sab saath-saath hai' kaa raag alaapte hai
 But Nitish Kumar has his own political history that he has not only caught a new path but has also chosen new partners due to neglect in the name of stake
 or ye aisa sach he jise bihar BJP ke netaa jaanate hai or kendriya netritv agar is baat ko nazarandaaz karata he to uskaa khamiyaja sab ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 After the suicide of ex-soldier Ramkishan Grewal, a national debate has erupted over the current system of OROP
 is masale par chal rahi raajnneeti ke bich ab bhi dedh lakh purv sainik hai jin tak nai oropi kaa phayda nahin pahunch paaya he

 His brother SP leader Shivpal Singh Yadav, who announced the leadership of the proposed Socialist Secular Front by Mulayam Singh Yadav, said on Sunday that Samajwadi Party starts from where Mulayam stands
 shivpal kii yah tippanee amitabh bachchan kii mashhoor film 'kaaliya' ke doylaag se milti julati he, amitabh ne film main kaha tha, "ham jahaan khadey ho jate hai, line vahiin se shuru hoti he
 "on the same lines, Shivpal tweeted and said," Samajwadi Party begins where Netaji (mulayam) stands
 " Shivpal's attempt to form a front is considered to be an attempt to reestablish the Shivpal-led faction in the Mulayam family
 vah chaahate hai ki mulaayam party ke mukhiya phir se bane
 The SP president is currently Akhilesh Yadav, who took over the reins of the party from his father
 vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ke kharaab pradarshan ke baad se hi shivpal maang kar rahe hai ki akhilesh pad se haten or party kii bagdor mulaayam ke haath main den
 Mulayam formed the SP in 1992
 shivpal ne kaha, "unhone (mulaayam) dharm nirpekshata ke liye jindagi or kai sarkarein daanv par laga deen isliye ham netaji ke saath khadey hai or khadey rahenge
 "mulayam also said in Mainpuri that efforts should be made to strengthen the SP
 sapa ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main kharaab pradarshan ke liye mulaayam ne congress ke saath gathbandhan ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 The comments mulaayam ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne unke jivan ko barbaad karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi thi or unke bete akhilesh ne congress se hi gathjod kar liya
 He told reporters, "the alliance with Congress is responsible for the party's current deterioration
 maine akhilesh ko salaah di thi ki vah aisa naa kare lekin usne kiya
 The SP is responsible for its defeat and not the people of the state
 " mulaayam pehle bhi haar ke liye akhilesh ko jimmedaar tehra chuke hai
 He had said that his son insulted him
 saath hi bole ki matadaataaon ne mahasoos kiya ki jo apane pita kaa nahin he vah kisi or kaa vishwaasapaatr nahin ho saktaa
 On the other hand, Shivpal, who won the election on Jaswant Nagar assembly seat, has threatened that if Akhilesh does not hand over the command of the party to Mulayam, he will form a secular front
 ramgopal yadav ko ‘shakuni’ bataane ke shivpal ke bayaan par mulaayam ne kaha ki shivpal ne jo kaha sahi he
 Efforts were made to defeat Shivpal
 iske liye dhan bhi kharch kiya gaya
 Ramgopal has also said that Shivpal should read the party's constitution before seeking Akhilesh's resignation
 akhilesh kisi bhi sthiti main istipha nahin denge or sapa kii kaman mulaayam ko saunpane kaa koi prashn nahin he

 akhilesh kisi bhi sthiti main istipha nahin denge or sapa kii kaman mulaayam ko saunpane kaa koi prashn nahin he
 Ever since the sp's poor performance in the assembly elections, Shivpal has been demanding that Akhilesh step down and give the reins of the party to Mulayam
 mulaayam ne hi 1992 main sapa kaa gathan kiya tha
 Shivpal said, "he (mulayam) lives for secularism and has put many governments at stake so we stand with Netaji and will stand
" " mulaayam ne bhi mainpuri main kaha ki sapa ko majboot karne ke prayaas hone chahie
 Mulayam blamed the alliance with the Congress for the sp's poor performance in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 tippaniyan Mulayam alleged that the Congress had left no stone unturned to ruin his life and that his son Akhilesh allied with the Congress
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "congress ke saath gathbandhan hi party kii maujuuda kharaab sthiti ke liye jimmedaar he
 i had advised Akhilesh not to do this but he did
 sapa apni haar ke liye khud jimmedaar he naa ki pradesh kii janata
 "mulayam has earlier also blamed Akhilesh for the defeat
 unhone kaha tha ki unke bete ne unka apmaan kiya
 At the same time, he said that the voters felt that one who does not belong to his father cannot be someone else's confidant
 udhar, jaswant nagar vidhansabha seat par chunaav jite shivpal ne dhamkee di he ki yadi akhilesh ne mulaayam ko party kii kaman nahin saunpi to vah dharm nirpeksh morche kaa gathan karenge
 On Shivpal's statement of Ram Gopal Yadav as 'shakuni', Mulayam said that what Shivpal said was correct
 shivpal ko haraane ke prayaas kiye gayi
 Money was also spent for this
 ramgopal bhi kah chuke hai ki shivpal ko akhilesh kaa istipha maangane se pehle party kaa samvidhan padhnaa chahie
 Akhilesh will not resign under any circumstances and there is no question of handing over the command of SP to Mulayam
 mulaayam ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ne unke jivan ko barbaad karne main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi thi or unke bete akhilesh ne congress se hi gathjod kar liya

 krimi layer ko is soochi se baahar rakhaa gaya havaise log jo iskar daata he yaa sarkari seva main hai yaa sarkari seva se ritair ho chuke hai unhen iskaa laabh nahin milegaa
 At the same time, people who have been illegally occupied since 1985 have not been included in this scheme
 isamen vaise log bhi shaamil nahin hai jo saarvjanikabhumi par kabjakar rah rahe hai

 Sopan Joshiham 1
 3 arab gandhi visheshgyon ke desh hai
 Every Indian and every member of his whatsapp group has a certain opinion about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 or kyon na ho? aakhir ham gandhi ko baar-baar vibhinn mudra ke noton par, sadakon ke naam par, murtiyon, tasveeron main dekhte-dekhte bade hote hai
 The work of the organizers searching the theme for the programs continues with the 'relevance of Mahatma Gandhi'
 unke bare main apramanik baton kaa pahaad khadaa he; bahut se log apane vichaaron ko prabhavi bana kar pesh karne ke liye amuman usamen gandhi ke kathanon ko galat-salat dhang se udghrut karte rahete hai
 It is easy to be like this
 gandhi kaa viraat saarvajanik jivan kaa varnan pramanik taur se sankalit hua he or sau khandon main 'sampurna gandhi vaanmay' main chapa he
 For decades, his name has been used to describe the titles of academic papers such as' Gandhi and
 
 
 ' (rikt sthaan main apni pasand kaa vishay khud bhar len)
 One of my former editors of pa-pa, an article titled 'gandhi and Marxism', 'gandhi and caste', 'gandhi and so-so', was so irritated that he printed an article titled 'gandhi and Aloo'
 gandhi kaa jivan ek khuli kitaab he, koi bhi apni jarurat ke mutabik unke jivan kii koi ek ghatana yaa kuch likhaa hua uthaa letaa he
 Yet ignorance about Gandhi's life is like a mountain
 subhaashachandr bose ne 1944 main pehali dfa unhen 'rashtrapita' kaha
 Since then this title has clung to them
 unki hatya ke baad jaise unke prati shraddha kii baadh thi, ab vaise hi unke prati vitrushna fail rahi he, yaa kam-se-kam hindutvvaadi tatv is koshish main lage hai
 It is like an intense desire to murder fathers
 unki smriti kaa apmaan karne se aajkal kai logon main shashaktikaran kaa sanchaar hota he
 They ask, who else is guilty if not the father of the nation for our country's problems? Why did they not save Bhagat Singh? Why did he choose Jawaharlal Nehru over Vallabhbhai Patel? Why did they allow partition? Why did he get that much money for Pakistan? Why did he support caste / varnashram
 
 
 
 Scholars have answered all such questions with full research
 lekin kisi dushprachaar par aadhaarit aarope ko jhuthalane main kaaphi vakt or koshish lagati he
 Apart from this, the distinction of truth and falsehood is getting erased in our era of social media
 bas naatakeey rup se aarope oochaal dene se kaam ban jaataa he
 Once Gandhi was asked how he remained hopeful even in the midst of all despair, his reply was that ordinary Indians have faith in non-violence
 jab poocha gaya ki unhen noummidi kisase hoti he, tab unka jawaab tha, padhe-likhe logon main karunaa kaa abhaav aa rahaa he
 These comments seem like a prediction today
 main 1970 or '80 ke dashak main jab bada ho rahaa tha tab karunaa acha shabd tha
 My childhood has passed between the Gandhian institutions of Delhi
 hamaare aasapaas aise kai vruddh log rahete the, jo apni javaani ke dinon main gandhi ke sahyogi the
 They were all humble, simple and sociable people who pampered us children

 After his death, we used to know about his sacrifices in a tribute meeting or a memorial article
 hamen unheen main gandhi ke darshan ho jate the
 There was no need to read Mahatma Gandhi's writings
 isaki jarurat 2017 main padi
 The Bihar government wanted to produce two separate books on Mahatma Gandhi for the children of primary and secondary
 is pariyojna main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii nijee dilchaspee thi
 The state government was engaged in organizing the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha
 shiksha ke surveykshan bataa rahe the ki chaatro main likhaa hua padhgaye or samajhane kii kshamta bahut kharaab he
 The government wanted to not only communicate the Gandhi idea through these books but also promote literacy
 uske salaahkaaron ne jab mujhase sampark kiya to maine unase kaha ki maine mahatma gandhi ko mul main nahin padhaa he
 But they said that they want a new style, because learned people write and read only for other scholars, not for children
 ve mahatma gandhi ke bare main behisaab dushprachaar or internet par nafrat dekhakar hairaan the
 He wanted two such books based on facts that even the weakest students could read
 ab gandhi mere liye ek vishay ban gaye
 The perceptions prevalent in the public are not based on mere facts and knowledge, but in a government project everything had to be historically correct
 iske alaava, gandhi khud saadhy kii shuddhta ke saath hi saadhan kii shuddhta ko bhi anivaary maanate the
 i saw Gandhi in the conduct of those people who lived their lives with the values laid down by them
 jab ham bachche gandhi kii kalpana nahin kar pate, tab ye puraane log hamen gandhi ke prasang sunaate
 We could feel Gandhi's love and compassion for all in his conduct
 lagata tha ki gandhi jaisaa vyakti or jivan sambhav he
 Today, the imagination to understand Gandhi is lost
 albert oinstin ne iske bare main chetaya tha
 He wrote that the succeeding generations could hardly believe that someone like Gandhi was on this earth
 ab aisi hi peedhishaan aa gai hai
 The people whose life was changed with Gandhi have all left
 nae logon ke paas gandhi ke sandarbh nahin hai
 True, there are hundreds of books and unlimited research materials on Gandhi
 lekin zyaadaatar shodh yaa to academik jarurat ke liye hota he yaa manoranjan ke liye
 Research is rarely done with open curiosity
 gandhi kii nipat moulikta acolpaneey he
 His close aides wrote that it took him a long time to understand Gandhi and his methods
 1934 main ve ahimsak chamada udyog lagaana chaahate the
 He considered the use of dead animal skins as mandatory for animal protection, but he did not assign this work to the caste people forced to do leather work by tradition, but to a Chitpavan Brahmin named Gopal Rajaram Valunjkar
 aise dher saare udhaaharan hai
 Mir Alam, who attacked him badly in South Africa, later became his protector
 jab sarkari mashinari 1947 main kolkata main dange rokane main naakaam ho gai thi to gandhi ke upwas ne vah kar dikhaaya tha jise aksar 'kalakatta kaa chamatkaar' kaha jaataa he
 The posters made at the Haripura Conference of Congress in 1938 were made by famous painter Nandlal Basu
 gandhi behad sankochi jeev the jinamein swaabhaavik pratibhaaen bahut nahin thim
 Neither was he an expert in speech-art, nor was his personality very attractive and influential
 lekin aashcharya yah ki phir bhi tarah-tarah ke kalakaar, sangeetkaar or srujansheel log gandhi kii sangat karne ke liye tatpar rahete the
 How can children be told about such a strange life? One is that writing should be simple and clean, which will make it difficult for the reader
 gandhi kaa apana gadhy saral he, alankarirahit he
 He left room for doubt for the reader in his writing
 in kitabon main bhi in baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya
 Readers say that reading this on Gandhi is surprising
 unki saralata, sab kuch saamne rakh dene kii unki eemaandaaree mugdh karti he
 Children have told that they never imagined that Gandhi was ever a weak child of a soft heart
 geeli ankhon se adhyapakon ne kaha he ki ve ahimsa ko kaayarta samajhane kii bhul kar rahe the, ki unhen uski bahaduree kaa andaja nahin ho paaya tha
 Two states are distributing these books in jails
 main yah jaanane ko utsuk hum ki karawas main band abhiyukt or apradhi itane prasiddh kaidi ko kaise dekhte hai
 The most surprised to those who study is how truthfully Gandhi confesses his fear and how hard he works to overcome it
 nehru ne ek baar kaha tha ki gandhi kii mahanatam uplabdhi yahi he ki unhone bharatiyon ke dilon se dar mitaa diya
 Fear prevails in the current political climate
 aise samay main nidar karunaa kaa sabak hamaare bacchon or unke adhyapakon ke liye nishchit hi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Sopan Joshi is the author of two books for children on Gandhi: one was Mohan and Bapu's Paati

 dilli uniwarsity main kai college ne 5-10 fisadi tak salanaa fees badhaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Although DU fees are equal for all colleges, but the colleges decide the fees according to their own
 chaatro kaa maananaa he ki college kii fees main zyada antar hone se unhen college chunane ke bare main sochna padegaa
 In DU, fees are equal for all colleges, but colleges are free to decide fees based on their resources
 ab jabaki undergrajuation course bhi 4 saal kaa ho gaya he, to jaahir he students ko graceuat hone ke liye zyada paise kharch karne honge
 By the way, the fee hike will have a greater impact on the students coming from outside Delhi, because they will not only have to bear the cost of fees, but they will also have to spend lodging-boarding for an additional year

 ab vah 27 november tak jail main rahenge
 Journalist Vinod Verma was produced in the court today
 adaalat main unako pesh karne ko lekar kuch der tak gahamaa gahami rahi
 Earlier some officials said that journalist Vinod Verma will not be brought to court
 video conferencing ke jariye unki peshi hogi
 But after some time information came that he would be produced in court
 jail vaahan se suraksha vyavastha ke saath unhen adaalat parisar main laayaa gaya
 The case was heard in court
 bachaav paksh ne patrkaar vinod verma ko swasthya samet buniyadi suvidhaayen nahin muhaiyaa karaae jane ko lekar adaalat main aavedan daakhil kiya

 Meanwhile, the police also presented their stand in the court
 abhiyojan paksh ne patrkaar vinod verma kii hastlipi kii maang kii he
 The defense opposed this by stating that the police wanted to plot false facts in front of the court
 dalile sunne ke baad adaalat ne 27 november tak nyaayik hiraasat kii avadhi badha di
 Attending journalists present in the court premises while going to jail for judicial custody, journalist Vinod Verma said that in today's era, the most difficult task is to do journalism

 In the last three days tensions between two big powers of Asia and India have reached new heights
 donon deshon kii ore se lagaataar dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hai
 This latest phase of tension has begun with the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Pradesh
 is daure ko lekar china kii aapattiyon par bharat ne saaf kaha ki china hamaare andruni maamalon main dakhal na de vahiin china ne kaha ki bharat ke is kadam se dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko baari nuksaan pahunchaa he or border par tanaav bad saktaa he
 Even China threatened to interfere in Kashmir on the Dalai Lama's case
 dalai lamas ke daure par tanaav to bas taaja maamla he lekin haal ke dinon main paanch aise bade mudde hai jinpar china or bharat jaisi badi shaktiyaan aamane-saamne hai or tanaav kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 1
 arunachal or leh main seemaa vivadakreeb 6 dashakon se bharat or china ke bich seemaa vivaad he lekin duniya kaa shaayad ye akelaa tanaav vaala border he jahaan 1962 ke yuddh ke baad ek bhi goli nahin chali he
 Both countries considered several mechanisms to resolve the border dispute, but nothing concrete has come to light so far
 pichley saal leh-ladakh main border main ilaakon ko lekar donon deshon ke sainik kai dinon tak aamane-saamne jame rahe to dalai lamas ke arunachal daure par china par sidhi dhamkiyon par utar aayaa he
 Recently, it was revealed that China can give up its claim on Aksaichin instead of Tamang of Arunachal
 lekin kya bharat tawang ko chhodega
 India is not convinced on this and in such a situation there is no scope of agreement on the border issue
 2
 The issue of India's membership in the NSG and the UNSC is in full swing for permanent membership of the UNSC, one of the world's second largest and fastest growing economies in the world
 is raah main china sabase bada roda he
 In the same way, China is constantly becoming a hindrance in India's efforts for membership of the NSG
 aise main videsh niti ke morche par bhi donon deshon ke bich tanaav spasht he
 India has a strong part against China in America's Asia policy, while India was a hindrance in China's efforts to gain maritime access through Pakistan
 aise main donon desh tanaav ke nae daur kii ore bad rahe hai

 pak-china aarthik galiyara or gilgit balatistan kaa mudda54 billian dollar kii laagat se taiyaar kiye ja rahe china-pakistan kaa aarthik galiyare ko bharat ne saaf taur par avaidh kaha he
 While China is adamant on completing it at any cost
 ye galiyara gilgit-balatistan se hokar gujarata he jise bharat apana hissaa maanata he or pakistan ke avaidh kabje se chhudaane kaa elaan kar chukaa he
 On the basis of China, Pakistan is trying to make gilgit-baltistan its fifth state
 ye maamla antarrashtriya manch par kabhi bhi tanaav kaa kaaran ban saktaa he

 ajahar masood or hafiz said kaa maamalamumbai hamalon ke mastermind pakistani aatanki ajahar masood or hafiz said par pratibandh lagane kii yuan main bharat kii koshishon ko do baar china roak chukaa he
 China is a permanent member of the Security Council and holds veto power
 bharat is tarah kii sthitiyon ke maddenjar hi suraksha parishad jaisi sansthaaon main sudhaar kii maang kar rahaa he
 India argues that in the last 6 decades the balance in the world has changed to a great extent
 bharat aaj ek badi shakti he or use suraksha parishad main sthaayee sadsyta milani chahie
 China has become a hindrance in this
 yahaan tak ki pakistani aantkiyon par karrwai kii bharat kii koshishon main bhi rode atakata rahaa he
 5
 dakshin china sagaradakshin china sagar kshetra main china kii dadaageeri ke khilaaf bhi bharat ne apni aawaaj buland kii he
 India opposed China's policies in the South China Sea in order to protect trade interests with its allies in the region
 america-japan samet tamaam desh is maamle main bharat ke samarthan main hai
 Of course, India does not have any direct claim to the South China Sea, yet 55 percent of its economic interests are connected to the South China Sea
 bharat kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki vivaadon main shaamil is kshetra ke deshon ko kisi prakaar kii dhamkee yaa bal prayog ke dar ke bina apane vivaadon ko hal karnaa chahie kyonki yadi aisa hota he to na chaahate hue bhi jatiltaayen paidaa ho jaaengi jisase kshetra kii shanti or sthirataa par bura prabhaav padegaa
 China has been warning India to stay away from the region
 aise main kabhi bhi in muddon par bharat-china main tanaav gambhir rup le saktaa he
 Complete sleep is very important for people of all ages, and especially for young children and growing children
 kai shodhon or research main is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ja chukaa he ki dimagi vikaas ke liye bacchon kaa bharpoor neend lenaa bahut jaruri he
 Do you know how much sleep is necessary for a child of which age group? Knowing the correct sleep of the child is very important for parents' information
 aaie jaane shishu avasthaa lekar 10 saal tak ke bachche ko kitni neend leni chahie
 Sleep of a child from New Born Baby up to 6 months is the most relaxing time of a child's life
 is avasthaa main bachche ko 16 se 20 ghante sona chahie
 However, sleep time depends on the child's habit of how much he sleeps
 6 se 12 maheene ke bachche kii neendis umr main bachche kaa sharir viksit hona shuru ho jaataa he, vah chalanaa sikhta or bolnaa bhi sikhane lagata he
 In such a situation, his body becomes tired and he must take at least 12 to 15 hours of sleep
 1 se 3 saal kii umr main kitni ho bachche kii neendis umr main baccha kaaphi active hone lagata he
 Therefore it is necessary to complete his 13-hour sleep
 3 se 5 saal tak ke bachche kii neendis umr main baccha saamaajik rup se active hone lagata he
