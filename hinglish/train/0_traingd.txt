 how will they access higher education ?? These hopes and dreams
 
 where do they stand in the reality of their world? The government schools in Jordan have added evening classes and 200 schools to accommodate the growing number of Syrian children which is approximately 12 xxrep 4 0 children

 Sulaiman needs a 2nd surgery because he has a clot in his nose
 The family moved from Syria to Jordan 5 years ago
 When i asked their mother what would be her wish
 
 
 considering the war hasn't ended, she said "if we can't go home all i want is for my kids to get an education so they can fend for themselves when they are older and help rebuild Syria
 We are blessed, we have enough to survive

 As we go about our daily privileged lives, it's hard to imagine that everything can be taken from you in an instant
 Today we spent the day in a host community meeting Syrian refugee families (like this one) so desperately seeking a safe place of normalcy for their families
 More than 80% of the Syrian refugees in Jordan live outside refugee camps in cities, urban centers and farming villages (host communities
 ) Amman hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees, about 180,000 people
 Refugee families in host communities have limited livelihood opportunities, and after 6 years, have depleted their savings and borrowed money from everywhere to feed and support their families

 He (bopara) should feel that he is no longer a child

 Wan said that when you play Test cricket, you cannot worship the player of the opposing team

 If you want to overcome this problem, then you can understand the aspect of astrology associated with dialect and adopt its remedies
 
 
 
 Which planets are related to Vani: - The lord of the second house of the horoscope controls the dialect

 - When Rahu is related to Mercury or Jupiter, speech has a wrong effect
 - kundali ke duusare bhav parapaap grahonka prabhaav hone se ham logon ko apni boli se dukhi karte hai
 This happens even if there is an amount of fire element or water element
 - khan-paan or dincharya thik na hone par boli main chidchidapan aata he
 - The chanting is bad even when chanting the wrong or impure mantra
 vaani kab hoti he acchhee:- kundali main budh ke majboot hone par mithi jubaan kaa vardaan miltaa he
 - If both Mercury and Jupiter are strong then the person speaks amazingly

 Sometimes, due to Saturn, there is pungency in the tongue

 Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's film 'fan' is going to release this week
 pesh he shahrukh se hui khaas baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:fain kii kya paribhaasha he?mere liye fain kaa matlab he 'kisi ko beintehaa pyaar karnaa'
 By the way, those who love far and wide love
 ghar main kaaphi sharton ke saath pyaar hota he
 Tell us about your look in the film, you are playing two characters? When we started the film, we already had in mind that these two should not look like double roles
 maine is film main superstar aryan khanna or gaurav donon hi kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 He too looks like Aryan i
e
 mine and considers himself Aryan Khan
 diarector manish chaahate the ki ek aisa fain ho jo thodaa bahut mere jaisaa lage
 How do you feel when you see someone who looks like you? i feel more handsome than i think
 gaurav ke kirdaar ke liye kam umr kaa dikhnaa kitna mushkil rahaa?is baar jo mechap kiya gaya use 'di mechap' kehete hai
 Who did Rishi Kapoor's makeup in 'kapoor and Sons', he is also helping us in this film
 main vaise bhi yang hi lagata hum isliye mujhe is kirdaar ko nibhaane main mushkil nahin hui
 i remember when i played the role of an elder in 'veerjara'
 us samay kaaphi mushkil hui thi
 i found it very difficult to call Rani Mukherjee as daughter
 kya aap kisi aise ziddee fain se mili hai?nahin, main zyaadaatar logon se miltaa hi nahin, lekin kai fain hai jo mujhe bahut pyaar karte hai
 There is a fan in America who has gifted me by buying land for me on the moon
 ek or fain hai jo meri tasviren bhi banaati hai
 There is a limit to the fan
 You cannot tell the fan what to do
 main ye jarur kah saktaa hum ki apane aap ko chotil mat karo, usase mujhe kabhi khushi nahin hogi
 My life is no longer private and my family also knows that i am no longer their only
 wo mere kaam ko samajhate hai
 At the airport too, he tells me, 'papa, we go out first, you come comfortably, because even the photo will take you time
 ' bacchon ko kaaphi samaj he
 i do not have a private life, but all i want is that i also have a daughter whom people do not abuse
 wo bahut bura lagata he
 That is why i sent children to study abroad so that they stay away from this kind of life
 aapke alaava or koun sa actor is role ko nibhaa saktaa tha?jo bhi is role ko nibhaataa, use dabl role jaisaa kaam karnaa padataa kyonki 'gaurav' ke kirdaar ko superstar jaisaa laganaa hi padataa
 Any well-starred actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, and Akshay could also play these roles for the role of a superstar as he would have to be seen as a 'superstar' on screen
 kya aapako lagata he ki aapke bete aryan bhi is film main 'gaurav' kaa kirdaar nibhaa sakate the?mujhe lagata he ki aryan ko itani acting nahin aati
 Gaurav's role required experience
 dabl role karnaa bahut hi mushkil he
 i had experience in 'duplicate'
 koi aisi film thi jo naa kar paane kaa dukh hua?main subhash kapur kii film 'jolly elelbi' karnaa chaah rahaa tha lekin baaki filmon ke saath kamitment hone ke chalate nahin kar paaya
 The film was very good
 'chak de' ke liye aditya ne mere liye dedh saal kaa intjaar kiya
 Now you will do more films in the year? Yes, now i have a lot of time
 mujhe kaam kii bhukh he or main saal main kam se kam 3 filmein jarur karuunga
 Would you like to work at an international level? All i would say is that 'fan' is a film of the same level
 international level par mujhe kisi ne kabhi bhi film nahin di
 By the way, it is a matter of great pride that Irfan, Priyanka, Deepika, Om Puri, Anil Kapoor are doing a good job at that place too
 ye saare actors bahut hi achche hai
 i did not get an offer and i do not even want to take a chance
 main india main ek aisi film banaaungaa jointernational levelper sabko pasand aegi
 After becoming celebs, the stress level also increases? When you are in such an industry, one thing should not be forgotten that you are not the person who appears on the screen
 star ko apane aapaki reality se parichit honi chahie
 Whenever the pair of Kabir Khan and Salman Khan came to the box office, it was famous
 chaahe ek tha tiger ho yaa bajrangi bhaijan
 By the way, with Tubelight too, Kabir has tried to cash this deadline combination
 haalanki kabir khan ne pichley kuch samay se salmaan ko lekar apane tevar thande kiye hai or unhen ek aam insaan banaakar pesh karne kii koshish kii gai he
 Find out in 5 points, where Salman's tubelight has fused
 What is the story of Tubelight? The story of Tubelight is of two brothers
 real life bhai salmaan khan or sohail khan ,film main bhi bhai hai
 Salman's IQ level is low
 uski batti der se jalati he jabaki sohail sena main bhartee ho jaataa he
 Then there is the india-china war
 puri kahani usee ke ird-gird gumti he
 This will be salman-katrina's look in 'tiger Zinda Hai'! Second half is more than ever
 First half is fun and in the second half there is a storm of emotions
 sohail or salmaan kaa bromance acha he
 Salman is messaging again
 music acha he lekin dher sara he
 Storyline is scattered
 film khinchi hui he
 'tubelight' seems to be an extension of Bajrangi Bhaijaan to some extent
 salmaan khan se hatke kya he tubalite main, 7 points main jananjajbati film he tubalitalagaataar yah duusari id he jab salmaan khan apane phens kii ankhon ko geela karne kii koshish karte najar aaenge
 In such a situation, this 'tubelight', which intermittently burns Salman's hardcore fans, can irritate him because his fans love Larger Than Life Salman
 phir banegi salmaan-katrina kii jodi, tiger jinda he ke sikval main aaenge najrasalmaan kaa role he shandarasalmaan ne maasoomiyat vaala role behtareen dhang se nibhaayaa he
 But Salman's attempt to play different types is worth it
 chinis actress jhu jhu or arunachal pradesh ke matin re film main chinis conection dikhaane ke liye he
 Zhu Zhu is attractive, Matin Fuli is Entertaining
 vaise salmaan khan kaa kahana he ki unki filmein rivyuu pruf hoti hai, aise main shaayad unhen is baat kii parvaah nahin he ki sameekshak kya kehete hai lekin hamaari najar is baat par rahegi ki salmaan kamai ke maamle main kitne aage jate hai

 main khel ke prayek pahalu ko lekar gambhir hona chahta tha or jitna sambhav ho puri tarah se dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahta tha
 Ashwin took 21 wickets in the series and not only that, he also scored a half-century in the second innings of the third Test
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòsiries se pehle main keval apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa chahta tha
 Each day of this series i wanted to maintain the rhythm i had achieved on the first day in Galle
 lay aisi cheez thi jise main puri siries main banaae rakhana chahta tha
 Every match had a spell in which i had a great rhythm
 ‚Äôaswin ne sweekaar kiya ki aakhri din jab kushal perera or angelo maithyuj ne chathe wicket ke liye 135 ran kii saajhedaari kii to unhone intjaar karo or mauka dekho kii ranneeti apanaai
 He said, 'the ball really got soft and even the fast bowlers were unable to swing it
 hamane tay kiya ki hamen ranon par ankush lagaana hoga or jab wicket girane shuru honge to ham iskaa phayda uthaaenge
 Even before the match, we felt that runs can be scored during this period
 ham duusari nai gend kaa intjaar kar rahe the or isliye ham match ko aage tak khinch rahe the
 i think as a unit we have carried out the strategy well

 Now he has occupied the second position after Sachin Tendulkar in the list of batsmen scoring the most centuries
 kallis ne bharat ke khilaaf tisare or antim test match kii pehali pari main apane karier kaa 39waan or phir duusari pari main 40waan shatak lagaaya
 This is his eighth over Newlands and sixth against India
 apana 145waan test match khel rahe kallis ne apane karier main duusari baar match kii donon pariyon main shatak jamaaya
 Earlier, he played 155 and unbeaten 100 innings in the Karachi Test against Pakistan in 2007
 kallis ab tak test khilne vaale deshon main se keval srilanka ke khilaaf hi shatak nahin laga paye hai
 He has scored the most eight against the West Indies and seven against England
 kallis ne bharat or pakistan ke khilaaf chah-chah, newjiland ke khilaaf paanch, austrailia ke khilaaf chaar, zimbabwe ke khilaaf teen or bangladesh ke khilaaf ek shatak lagaaya he
 The ten batsmen who have scored the most centuries in Test cricket are: Sachin Tendulkar (51), Jacques Kallis (40), Ricky Ponting (39), Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara (both 34), Steve Wa (32), Rahul Dravid ( 31), Matthew Hayden (30), Dan Bradman (29) and Mahela Jayawardene (28) rahul gandhi kii ore se istife kii peshkash kiye jane ke baad maharashtra congress ke adhyaksh ashok chavaan ne bhi istife kaa prastaav diya he
 Chavan believes that Rahul Gandhi alone cannot be held responsible for the Congress's defeat and the president of every state is responsible for this
 chavaan ne kaha ki maharashtra main congress ke kharaab pradarshan ke peeche prakaash ambedkar kii party zyada doshi he
 After Rahul Gandhi was offered his resignation as the National President, many leaders from different states are giving their respective resignations
 inamen maharashtra unit ke adhyaksh ashok chavaan bhi shaamil hai
 Speaking to the media, Chavan said that Rahul Gandhi is not alone responsible for the Congress's poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, but all the regional presidents are equally responsible
 chavaan ne apana istipha saunp diya he or unka kahana he ki is par antim faisla rahul gandhi ko lenaa he
 Maharashtra, especially Mumbai, has been a Congress stronghold before the last two Lok Sabha elections
 ab maharashtra or mumbai donon jagah congress kii haalat dayaneey he
 The process of deterioration began when, just before the election, Sujay Vikhe Patil, son of Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Patil, quit the Congress and joined the BJP
 isse bhi bada jhatka ye rahaa ki sujay vikhe patil ne bijepi ke tikat par ahmednagar seat par jeet hasil kar lee
 The process of congressional tremors did not stop
 2014 ke chunaav main jabardast modi lahar ke baavjood vijay hasil karne vaale ashok chavaan bhi is baar record 40 hajaar voton se haar gaye
 Chavan's defeat is a huge loss for the Congress because the party never dreamed that it could happen
 ashok chavaan kii haar ke baad congress ne iskaa thikra prakaash ambedkar kii party vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie) party ke maathe par phoda he
 Even Chavan has said that Prakash Ambedkar's party is bjp's b party
 congress kaa maananaa he ki maharashtra main vibie ke kaaran 9-10 siton kaa nuksaan hua he
 Ashok Chavan said, 'rahul Gandhi is not alone responsible for this defeat
 ham kai rajyon main haare hai
 All the state presidents are responsible for this, so they should also resign
 maharashtra main haar kii jimmedaari meri he
 We want Rahul Gandhi to take tough steps, make necessary changes in the party and give leadership to the Congress
 prakaash ambedkar kii party ke kaaran hamane kai siten haari hai
 Actually they were working for BJP
 kuch maheene baad kai rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 i am confident that the situation will be different in the assembly elections
 yah team work he, isliye rahul gandhi ko akele jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa

 html With the replacement of the old notes of 1000 and 500 rupees, there was also a desire among the people for the new notes of two thousand rupees, many people lined up in front of the post offices and banks in the morning
 lekin dilli main nae note ne zaraa der main darshan die
 When our team reached New Delhi's head post office, Gol Dak Khana, at seven in the morning, the first people were present to exchange notes and withdraw money from their account in the form of new notes
 kuch kii majaburi thi or kuch nae note kii chahat main yahaan pahunche
 The information was here that from eight o'clock in the morning, the change of note in the post office would start and people would get the money worth spending quickly
 lekin aisa nahin hua or logon ko acchhee khaasi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 People arriving at the post office ahead of time: People who arrived at the post office early in the morning got to see a notice that contained information about what would happen at which counter, but at what time the process would start, there was no mention of it
 duusare pataa chalaa ki sirf idi card dikhaane se kaam nahin chalegaa, balki uski photocopy bhi deni hogi, bas line chhodkar log photocopy karaane bhaage
 But then came the information that the post office would start its work from ten o'clock, what would the forced people do, so there was no option but to wait
 logon ke sabar kaa imtihaan yaheen khatm nahin hua, kyonki das baje daakghar ke andar se khabar mili ki bank se cash aane main vakt lagegaa
 Anand, who had been in the line for three hours, said that he had come with great hope that even though the line would have to be done, the work would be done easily, but the hours spent in the line had passed, the note did not appear
 yahi haal satish kaa tha, aphis jane ke liye ghar se jaldi nikle taaki raste main daakghar main rukkar note badalawa lenge, lekin teen ghante intazaar ke baad bhi 11 baje tak pradhan daakghar main paise kaa lenden shuru hi nahin ho paaya
 Post office workers also looked shocked
 baat karne par pataa chalaa ki unhen to apane saamaanya samay par hi daakghar kholane ke nirdesh the, subah aath baje kaa vakt kahaan se aayaa unhen nahin pataa
 Still, there was a delay in getting cash from the bank, so the wait for people increased

 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki grih vibhaag dwaara somvaar shaam mantralay se jari yah aadesh 30 navambar 2012 ko aparaahn se prabhaavasheel hoga
 Ramnivas is currently posted as Director General of Police, Chhattisgarh Armed Forces and Naxal Operations
 ramanivas rajya main pichley lambey samay se atirikt police mahanideshak (naksal aaparishan) ke pad par bhi rahe hai
 In Naxal-affected Chhattisgarh, there have been many successful campaigns against Naxalites under his leadership
 mokshada ekadshi margshirsh shukla ekadshi ko aati he
 This day is called the day of salvation
 isi din bhagwaan krishna ne arjuna ko gita kaa gyaan diya tha
 On this day worship worship makes a person attain salvation
 is din daan kaa fal anant guna maatr main praapt hota he
 Do these remedies on Mokshada Ekadashi- Bath early in the morning and offer water to the Sun God - After that, wear yellow clothes and worship Lord Krishna
 - unhen pile phool, panchamrita or tulsi dal arpit karen- iske baad bhagwaan krishna ke mantron kaa jap karen- yaa bhagavadgita kaa paath karen- kisi nirdhan vyakti ko vastron yaa ann kaa daan karen- vaise to nirjal upwas rakhana uttam hota he- parantu aavashyaktaa hone par jaleey aahaar or falahar liya ja saktaa haigita jayanti kaa kya mahatv he?- margshirsh shukla ekadshi ko bhagwaan krishna ne kurukshetra ke maidan main arjuna ko gita kaa upadesh diya tha- isi din ko gita jayanti ke naam se manaaya jaataa he
 - Gita is not just a book but it is a lively form of sermons and hence its birth anniversary is celebrated
 - iske upadesh aaj bhi utane hi praasangik hai jitne purv main the atah har kaal main jeevant hone ke kaaran bhi isaki jainti manaai jaati he
 - On this day liberation from the recitation of the Gita gives the blessing of salvation and peace- Recitation of the Gita liberates from the unknown problems of life
 Perform worship in this method- Put a yellow cloth on a checkpoint - Establish Lord Krishna on it- Also install a new copy of Gita by wrapping it in red or yellow cloth - offer fruits, confectionery and panchamrit - then chant the mantras of Shri Krishna - then recite the entire Gita Or text of Chapter 11 a pray your Kamnapurthy Arti Khen- Gita g jab bhi jati kaa prashn aata he to kuch log isko sire se nakaarne ke liye khadey ho jate hai
 By the way, there are a large number of people in cities who have not experienced caste that way, but their number is negligible
 jati or isse judi ghatnaon kii sachai se inkaar karnaa vaisaa hi he jaise ghar ke peeche kii taraf naala he to khidki ko hi band kar lenaa
 While the buzzing sewer continues to flow
 is bajbajaahat kii sabase kaarunik or rosh bhari abhivyaktiyaan hamen un aatmakathaaon main milti hai jinhen jatigat vyavastha main haashiye par dhakel die gaye logon ne isaki bheeshanta kaa saamana karte hue darj kiya he
 We know this as Dalit literature
 bharat rang mahotsav main patna kii raaga sanstha ke abhinaytaon ne apane urjavan or samvedansheel abhinay se manch par bhartiya saamaajik jivan kii aisi gaatha pesh kii jo avishwasaneey si lag sakati he lekin uskaa yatharth bhoga chuke log hamaare bich hi hote hai
 These actors, along with the life, oppression of Dalits, also showed their courage and aspirations in front of the audience
 manch par varshon kii dabi hui chuppi kai baar cheekh main bhi badali lekin hamen swikaarna hoga ki kuch sachchaiyon ko jor se hi kahana padataa he
 The narrative of the suffering and exploitation of Dalits is not monogamous
 daliton ke bheetar bhi shreniyan hai
 Many are such that they are outside this caste system
 unke shoshan ke alag aayam hai
 The Randhir-directed color presentation 'outcast' exposes many layers of the social truth of oppression to the audience through Sharan Kumar Limbale's famous autobiography 'akkarmashi'
 ‚Äòakkarmashi‚Äô main limbale ke jivan ke kai prasangon kaa vistaar se varnan he jahaan ve jati vyavastha ko jhelte hai
 They repeatedly ask where is their place in this system? Who are they akkarmashi ek jaraj santan ke sangharsh kii sachhee katha he
 Akkarmashi means he does not know his father exactly
 ab chunki pita nahin he to upnaam nahin he or jati nahin he
 The most pitiable situation while battling with this is that of Limbale's mother, whom the child Limbale sees with his own eyes and asks 'has anyone seen their mother also having sex?' The problem of identification is at several levels here
 akkarmashi, mahaar jaisi dalit jati se bhi saamaajik hyrarki main neeche hai
 They neither have the right to drink water nor to love
 kathin sangharsh se shiksha or aarakshan se naukari hasil karne ke baad bhi inhen saamaanya naagarik ke haq hasil nahin ho pate
 Limbale has to stay in the crematorium even while doing the job
 ve bataate hai ki asal ladaai samaaj main sammanjanak jagah paane kii he
 After independence, the Indian Constitution gave them reservation and some other rights but did not get a respectable place till date
 or aaj aarakshan or daliton ko sarankshit karne vaale kanoon ke virodh main maharashtra main hi andolan shuru ho gaya he
 The presentation strongly favors reservation
 prastuti main abhinayta kehete hai 'aarakshan khatm karo lekin pehle hamaare jaisaa jivan jikar to dikhaao
 ' kahani ko rangamanch par prastut karne ke liye aakhyaan ko kai str die gaye hai
 One plays a plot that is called alternately by all characters
 kahani kehete hue unki gatividhiyon se unke utpeedan kaa prasang bhi manch par ghatit hota rahata he
 The sensations of the narrative are further thickened by music and by the motions of the actors
 marathi ke saath-saath, bhojpuri ke lokgeeton kaa acha istemaal kiya gaya he
 The presentation is supported by a historical and contemporary perspective through the video
 in drishyon main daliton kii utpatti kii brahmanvaadi vyakhya he
 There is the statement of JNU student, who has to face caste identity even in this institution and speech of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 video drishyon ke jariye kuch or bhi samasamayik ghatnaayen jodi ja sakati thim
 The writer is a Dalit and Savarna the director of the presentation, so it was also curious whether any part of the caste identity comes in which the upper caste identity is outspoken? But the directors have fully maintained their commitment with Dalit struggle and narrative
 prastuti ke dauraan maujuud limbale bhi isaki saraahna karte hai
 Today, when the issue of Dalits talking about Dalits is a debate, then this presentation should be seen that there is a common goal of liberation which can be found only by breaking the distinction between varna and class
 yah jarur he ki isamen unako sabase adhik tyaag karnaa hoga jinke kaaran yah vyavastha he
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood
 jaanane ke liye yahaan padhein samay ke saath saath khabaron kaa live apadation

 lekin prekshkon kaa kahana he ki badalte vakt or peedi ke saath usne koi 62 saal pehle apana nayaa avatar lene ke baad pehali baar badalanaa shuru kiya he
 The Jamaat was founded on 26 August 1941 in Lahore by the eminent Muslim thinker Maulana Abul Al Maududi with the aim of establishing hukumat-e-ilahi
 vibhaajan ke vakt ve pakistan chale gaye the or vahaan unhone rajnatik party ke rup main jamaat-e-islamic pakistan bana lee thi
 a year later, his colleagues and mullahs in India held a meeting in Allahabad in April 1948 and renamed him jamaat-e-islami Hind and eminent scholar Maulana Abulais Nadvi became his emir
 isi ke saath jammu-kashmir main jamaat kii ikai ek swatantra sanghathan ban gai
 By the name of Jammu and Kashmir jamaat-e-islami, she was closer to the Jamaat of Pakistan than the Jamaat of India
 pakistan main vahaan kii jamaat ne ugravadi or kattarpanthi majahabi tevar apanaate hue islamic sarkaar ke liye samasyaayein khadi kin to 1948 or 1953 ke bich use chaar baar gaiyrkanoonee qaraar diya gaya or uske sarvocch netaa moulana maududi ko 'rajdrohpurn lekhan' ke aarope main 1953 main sajaae maut sunai gai
 This was later commuted to life imprisonment
 yahi nahin, 1953 main pakistan kii jamaat ne musalamaanon main 'bhatkaavvaadi aacharan' ko rokane kii koshish main vahaan ahmadiya samudaay ke khilaaf muhim ched di, jiskaa parinaam 2,000 logon kii maut main niklaa
 Due to this movement, the then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto declared Ahmadis as non-muslim minority in 1974
 or bangladesh ban jane ke baad usne kattarpanthi jamaat-e-islamic bangladesh kaa bhi gathan kar daalaa
 Meanwhile, the Jamaat of Pakistan forged close ideological and practical links with Islamic movements and missions working in different continents and countries and kept them moving

 Its members were not allowed to enter the political stage
 lekin immergency ke dauraan iske khilaaf hui karrwai kaa isaki soch par gaharaa asar hua
 It was banned along with the RSS and other organizations and many of its leaders and activists were put in jail
 unhone ek-duusare kii vichaardhaaraon ko samaj or iske netaaon ko ehsaas hua ki bhartiya sandarbh main 'dharmanirpekshata' kaa matlab laa-diniyat (naastikta) nahin he balki yah bhartiya samvidhan kii mul visheshta he, jisamen yah pakkaa kiya gaya he ki rajya kaa koi dharm nahin hoga or vah nagarikon ko apane-apane dharm par chalane kii aazaadee kii guarantee detaa he
 After the Emergency, the Jamaat lifted the ban on its full-time members from exercising their right to vote, and last year amended their constitution to allow them to enter politics on their own terms
 jamaat kaa apana itihaas he
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Muslim institutions and institutions that spoke of Muslim community emerged in various forms
 muslim alpsankhyakon ke hiton ko swar dene ke liye 1870 main indo-oriental muslim skool vajood main aayaa, jo 1881 main anglo-mohammaden oringtal college or phir 1920 main aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ban gaya, 1906 main indian union muslim lig, 1911 main tabaligi jamaat, 1919 main jamaat-e-ulma-e-hind, 1941 main jamaat-e-islamic or 1964 main ol india muslim majalis-e-mushaavrat kaa gathan hua
 But in 1925, when a strong revivalist and Hindu nationalist movement in the form of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was born, the stance of the Muslim community's perceived representatives also tightened
 inamen jamaat kaa drushtikon to adiyal bana rahaa
 Many people believe that many Islamic organizations, including the Jamaat, were not ready to reform their movement even in this scientific period of democracy and secularism till recently
 aresas or jamaat kii gatividhiyon par gahari najar rakhane vaale bhakpa ke rashtriya sachiv atul anjaan kehete hai, 'jamaat ke netaaon or vichaarkon ko ab yah ehsaas ho janaa chahie ki bharat koi dharmatantra nahin balki ek bahudaleey dharmanirpeksh loktantr he
 a new political party promoting religion will neither have constitutional validity, nor will any section of society accept it
 ' udhar, bhaajapa ke yuva saansad or purv kendriya mantri saiyad shahanvaj 'san (jo bihar ke ek muslim bahul chunaav kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai) kehete hai ki pichley saat dashak se ek saamaajik-dharmik sanghathan ke rup main astitv rakhane ke baavjood jamaat kabhi musalamaanon kii aawaaj nahin ban saki
 Its leaders should realize that if their organization could not grow, it is because the roots of secularism are very deep in this country
 'nai party zyada se zyada yah karegi ki raajnneeti main kattarwad ko hawa degi
 'its activities in the past sowed the seeds of doubt among Indian Muslims
 or badlaav ke prati utsuk or ek 'mishan' se sarabor jamaat ne aakhirkaar 'svachh or mulya aadhaarit' raajnneeti karne kaa faisla kiya he, lekin jaisaa ki anjaan kaa kahana tha, jab tak vah apni soch badalakar dharmanirpekshata main aasthaa rakhane vaali mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main shaamil nahin hoti, chola badalane kaa koi phayda nahin hoga
 And this is the reason why the Jamaat is a victim of dilemma today

 " Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, while attacking the Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Yadav, said that Lalu should look into his own self before talking about constitution, democracy and public dignity
 lalu ne kejariwal ko roke jane par uthaae the savaldilli menvan rank van pensionke mudde par aatmahatya karne vaale purv jawan ramkishan greval kii maut ke baad jis tareeke se dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko dilli police dwaara ram kishan ke parivaar waalon se milane se roka gaya or phir hiraasat main bhi liya gaya, ise lalu ne gaiyr samvidhanik or gaiyr loktantric qaraar diya tha
 Modi's sharp attack on Lalu Modi said that while going to jail in the fodder scam, Lalu Yadav had made his illiterate wife Rabri Devi the chief minister, bypassing the senior leaders of the party and running the government, she was given the constitution and localism
 Why not worry
 'lok laaj kii baat na karen lalu'unhone kaha, 'kejariwal ke khilaaf police karwai par samvidhan or loktantr kii baat karne walelalu prasadko pehle apane girebaan main jhaankna chahie
 Why did he not remember the Constitution and democracy when he made his illiterate wife the Chief Minister and ran the government
 tab unhen na samvidhan kii chintaa thi or na hi loklaj kii
 Sushil Modi said that Lalu linked a day's symbolic action on irresponsible reporting to a private news channel with the Emergency
 lalu apatkaal lagane vaali congress party ke sabhi vidhayakon ko mantri banavaa chuke hai or ab unki party congress ke saath mahagathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil he, isliye unhen lok laaj kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 Protection of criminals associated with power, Lodi lashed out at Lalu when the MLA Rajaballabh Yadav, accused of raping his own party, gave the party after the Holi in jail, after which the assistant jailer and three others were dismissed
 It has become that political patronage is being given to the accused and criminals associated with power

 Sunil was an MA in economics
 uske baad padhai kaa vichaar chhod jivan ke kshetra main laut gaye or prayog karne lage
 If he wanted, he could avail the opportunity of studying in every subject from the best universities in the world
 lekin chale gaye hoshangabad
 Where the tribal people were displaced by the dam being built on the Tawa river
 sunil ne sabhi ko sangathit kiya or jalashay main machhlee maarane ke adhikaar kii ladaai shuru kar di
 In the end the government had to give the right to fish farming
 tawa jalashay kaa yah prayog kaaphi charchit hua tha kyonki adivasee machhlee pakadana nahin jaanate the
 By training them in a short time, they made them so capable that the revenue of the year reached 125 million
 arthshaastra kaa yah pratibhashali chaatr apane visthapiton ko aarthik gatividhiyon kii mukhyadhara main le aayaa
 But later the government felt that it brought consciousness among the tribals, then stopped this successful project
 yah sunil ke gandhivadi samaajawaadee jivan kaa chota sa parichay he
 His life tells that if a talented young man with good education returns to the villages, he makes a positive change
 bahut mushkil he sabhi ke liye kar paanaa lekin jo kar gaye unke liye bahut aasaan bhi tha
 Even today many students go to work in villages or backward areas
 sankhya kam he magar niyat vahi he jo sunil kii thi
 Only 54 years of age due to cancer
 acchhee baat he ki unke mitra unhen yaad rakhana chaahate hai
 He holds a lecture every year in memory of his limited resources

 Come to hear me on Saturday
 pratibhashali chaatro ke bich bolne kii apni sakuchaahat hoti he
 i have spoken at such a place, but while going to JNU, i was repeatedly thinking what would be said in JNU
 lekin sabhaagaar ke baahar se hi jo pyaar mila vah abhibhoot karne vaala tha
 There was no space in the auditorium, yet stood still and reached there long before the program started
 bahut se chaatr sabhaagaar ke baahar sheet main khadey hokar sunate rahe
 Knowing this my head bowed
 mujhe iskaa bilkul andaaza nahin tha
 Otherwise, he would have prepared well
 meri aadat he
 i do not enjoy speaking until the preparation is done
 lekin aap sabhi ne meraa utsaah badha diya
 JNU survived every round
 je en you ko badnaam karne kii koshishen chalati rahengi lekin is uniwarsity ne vaaki chaatro ke bich ek sapana dikhaaya he ki uniwarsity jeenyu jaisi honi chahie
 Thanks again guys

 shivasena ko chhod dijie, sabase pehle aresas ko bijepi se poochna padegaa ki aap ram mandir bana rahe hai yaa nahin bana rahe hai
 Raut said that there was such a big massacre of Hindus in the movement for the Kiram temple, will you apologize to the country? In the name of the temple, there has been such a huge destruction in this country, bomb blasts have taken place
 iske liye koun jimmedaar he? agar nyaayalay main janaa tha to andolan se pehle janaa tha
 BJP is the biggest beneficiary on these questions, you have to answer
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki ham dekh rahe hai ki aresas or vishwa hindu parishad kii is par kya pratikriya he
 Shiv Sena said that if ordinance comes, we will definitely support, but the language changed on the temple of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP

 There is a mutual agreement between Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav on the background of the Grand Alliance in UP
 sutron kii maane to rahul or akhilesh milakar uttar pradesh main dimple yadav or priyanka gandhi ke saath milakar bijepi ko rokane kii taiyaari kii ranneeti bana chuke hai
 Although Mulayam Singh is still hoping to make Akhilesh the face of CM, he is ready to sideline Shivpal and Amar Singh from UP politics, but Akhilesh should replace Ramgopal who was made president of the United Janata Parivar before the Bihar Assembly elections
 Keep saying that don't be a part of it
 upi main simit rahiye
 According to sources, Mulayam Singh says that during that time pictures and videos of Ram Gopal Yadav meeting with BJP President Amit Shah were also revealed
 sapa or congress ke bich aane vaale dinon main samjhauta takreeban tay dikhaai de rahaa he
 The matter is with the Akhilesh faction of the Samajwadi Party, with which Congress strategist Prashant Kishor has been in constant contact
 vah bataa chuke hai ki samjhauta takneekee taur par jeet or haar ke lihaaj se hona chahie
 Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav agree with both of Kishore's words
 sutara bataate hai ki sab kuch sahi disha main chal rahaa he
 On Tuesday, January 10, Akhilesh Yadav can come to Delhi and meet Rahul Gandhi
 jiske baad agle do-chaar dinon main samaajawaadee party congress ke saath ajit singh kii areldi, sanjay nishad kii nishad party, pis party, argedy, apana dal kaa doosraa gut anupriya patel ke khilaaf he, pis party jaise chote dal milakar bihar kii tarj par mahagathbandhan banaaenge
 With this, Akhilesh Yadav will be seen in the role of Nitish Kumar on the lines of Bihar
 isliye siyaasi daanv pench ke round robin aadhaar par match jari he
 If sources are to be believed, Akhilesh Yadav has decided that the name and election symbol of this socialist party will either be his or it will be free
 jiske baad hi mulaayam ke akhilesh samaajawaadee party se progressive samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya banakar cycle ke vikaas ko aage badhaate hue motorcycle ko pracheen banaaenge
 However, what will be possible will have to wait for this
 mulaayam ne lakhanu pahunchakar saaf kar diya ki akhilesh agle mukhyamantri honge
 If the government is formed, then the matter is stuck that Mulayam's political wrestlers Shivpal and Amar Singh are ready to surrender to Mulayam
 akhilesh ko mukhyamantri banane ke sawaal par sabhi sahamat hai
 But the question that remains is, will Mulayam's Shivpal and Amar have an edge? Will Akhilesh be able to side with Ram Gopal? Mulayam has tried that son you are my next chief minister
 meri baat maan le lekin akhilesh pareshaan hai ki aaj maan lee par kal ko shivpal or amar ke kehane par netaji palat gaye to main kya karuunga
 However, Mulayam and Akhilesh are father-sons
 baat karke faisla kar sakate hai
 The old leaders are trying that the world rests on hope
 kaash ummid puri ho jaae isliye samaajawaadee parivaar ke is jhagade main parivaarwaad jor pakad rahaa he
 Socialism is being left behind
 lekin lagaam kiske haath hogi jhagada is baat kaa he
 It is to be decided that Mulayam is not ready to leave and Akhilesh is trying to rein
 isliye maamla ulajh rahaa he

 The most important political statement in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's latest speech was about communalism
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle laal kile se apane aakhri bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne bijepi ke aghoshit piem ummidavaar narendra modi ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki bharat main tang or sampradayik vichaaron ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 These ideas will weaken democracy and the country and such ideas should be stopped from flourishing

 Such thinking divides our society and weakens democracy
 hamen ise rokna hoga
 In the nearly 30-minute speech, the Prime Minister made no direct comment about Modi, but political experts believe that his reference was only to the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'hamen apni samskruti kii un paramparaon ko majboot karnaa hoga, jo hamen duusari vichaardhaaraon ke prati sahansheel hona or unka sammaan karnaa sikhaati hai
 Today, i appeal to all political parties, all sections of society and the general public for efforts in this direction

 The month of Magha is called the eleventh lunar month and the tenth solar month of the Indian Samvatsara
 hindu panchang ke anusaar isbaar magh maheene kii shuruyaat mangalvaar 2, janvari se hui or 31 janvari tak ye maheenaa chalata rahegaa
 Since this month ends on the full moon of Magha nakshatra, for this reason it is called Magh month
 shastron or puraanon ke anusaar magh maheene main puja-archana or snaan dhyaan karne se punya laabh miltaa he
 By the way, every day of the month of Magh goes like a festival
 lekin kuch khaas dinon kaa khaas mahatv bhi is maheene main he
 
 
 It is believed that this year there are seven dates of the month of Magh on which bathing in the holy rivers can change the fate
 aamtaur par mana jaataa he ki magh maheene ke dauraan aadmi ko kam se kam ek baar kisi pavitra nadi main snaan jarur karnaa chahie
 But this time it is becoming such a coincidence that you can achieve Akshaya Punya and auspicious fruits by applying holy dip for seven or two whole days
 
 
 to ab ham aapako bataate hai ki aakhir wo khaas tithiyaan koun-koun si hai jab snaan karne or puja-archana karne se aapke jivan main saubhaahgya aa saktaa heis baar magh maheene kii pehali sabase mahatvapurn tithi pad rahi he shuukravaar 12 janvari ko shatatila ekadshi he
 On this day, bathing with sesame water is done, boiling of sesame is done, havan is done by sesame itself and drinking sesame water, eating sesame seeds and donating sesame seeds gives very good results
 mana jaataa he ki shatatila ekadshi par til-snaan se sabhi paapon kaa naash hota he
 The next important date of the month of Magh is Sunday, 14 January
 14 janvari ko makar sankranti bhi manaai jaati he
 However, there are some astrological differences this time on celebrating Makar Sankranti on 14 January
 lihaaja desh ke kuch ilaakon main 15 janvari ko bhi makar sankranti manaai ja sakati he
 After holy bath on the day of Makar Sankranti, one should donate sesame seeds and a dish made of sesame must be included in the meal
 magh maheene kii teesri shubh tithi he mangalvaar,16 janvari
 This day is Maghi Amavasya
 jise krishna paksh kii mauni amavasya bhi kaha jaataa he
 This date is also very sacred
 yah pitaron ke liye tarpan karne kaa din he
 It is believed that one should bathe on the Triveni Sangam or the Ganges coast on this day
 or snaan ke baad til ke laddu, til kaa tel, aanwala, vastra vagairah kaa daan karnaa chahie
 This time the fourth auspicious date of the month of Magha is falling on Monday, January 22
 yah din basant panchami kaa he
 Goddess Saraswati is worshiped on this day
 or mana jaataa he ki is tithi par mata saraswati ko kesaria chaaval kaa bhoga lagane se vishesh fal miltaa he
 The next important date of the month of Magh is on Wednesday, January 24
 is din achala saptami he
 On this day, there is recognition of offering special worship to the Sun God by offering water
 achala saptami kaa mahatv bhagwaan shrikrishna ne yudhisthir ko bataaya tha
 It is said that on this date, a person goes to Baikuntha by bathing, donating, offering the ancestors, worshiping Lord Surya
 mana jaataa he ki is din vrath rakhane se saal bhar ravivaar ke din rakhe vraton ke baraabar punya miltaa he
 This time, another special date of Magh month is Saturday, 27th January
 is din jaya ekadshi he,jise bhishma ekadshi bhi kaha jaataa he
 On this day, lamps should be lit near Tulsi at sunset and worship Lord vishnu-lakshmi
 manyata he ki is din snaan-daan or puja se aadmi ke sab paap cat jate hai
 And this time the last most important date of Magh is Wednesday, 31 January
 is din poornima he or chandra grahan bhi rahegaa
 On this day, bathing in the holy river gives the very beautiful fruit of donating to the poor
 
 The importance of Maghi Purnima is considered to be the highest
 mana jaataa he ki is din chandramaa apni solah kalaon se shobhyman hokar amrit kii varsha karte hai
 Its parts are found in plants, rivers, and reservoirs
 isliye inamen saare rogon se mukti dilaane vaale gun paidaa hote hai
 It is also believed that bathing and donating on Magha Purnima provides freedom from the defects associated with the Sun and Moon

 One experiment is to make people cheaper to buy by making loans cheaper
 4 oktober ko rigerv bank apni maudrik niti main byaaj daron ko ghataane kaa faisla le saktaa he
 If the State Bank's research is to be believed, these cuts can further reduce the interest rates received on more than 40 million term deposit accounts of the elderly
 saste lone kii hode bujurgon ke liye baari pad rahi he, lone sasta hone kaa asar yah he ki bainkon main jamaa khaaton par milane vaale byaaj daron main bhi lagaataar kami ho rahi he
 From October 1, a new formula to fix interest rates according to the market has come into force
 jiske tahat rigerv bank jaise hi bainkon ke liye apana lone rate ghatayega baaki baikon ko bhi tatkaal byaaj dar badalanaa hoga
 According to the estimates of the State Bank, the elders in banks across the country have accumulated about 14 lakh crore rupees, or seven per cent of GDP as term deposits

 The country's largest bank State Bank of India has said in its research note that this round of declining interest rates can further reduce the interest rate of these deposit accounts
 saath hi iskaa asar nijee upbhog kharch main kami aane kaa andeshaa he
 From October 1, banks are adopting new formulas for interest rates
 puraane vaale kii khami yah bataai ja rahi he ki bainkon ko jis dar par rigerv bank se lone miltaa tha yani repo rate main badlaav kaa phayda bank lonadharakon ko nahin de rahe the
 Now the government will fix the rate by combining three options like repo rate and treasury bill (rate of government instruments)
 is nae rate formule ko repo rate linking rate (RLLR) kaha gaya he
 Banks will no longer fix interest rates on loans based on their personal base rate and deposit cost
 byaaj daron main katautee kaa asar keval bujurgon par nahin balki kul gharelu karjon par padaa he
 People have taken a fierce loan

 a maximum of Rs 15 lakh can be deposited in the Elderly Savings Scheme (SCSS)
 bank ke aarthik research team kaa kahana he ki is skim par milane vaala byaaj dar texable he or agar 8
 Assuming an interest rate of 6 percent, by March 2018, about 38,663 crore rupees have to be paid to the elderly
 agar sarkaar is byaaj dar ko puri tarah tex free karti he to sarkaar ko tex main keval 3092 karod rupee kii chapat lagegi
 In this way the government's deficit (fiscal) is only 0
 2 fisadi badhegaa
 But the question is whether taxpayers will also fill this growing deficit
 mushkil bhare aarthik halaat main sarkaar or bainkon ke paas simit upaay hai
 Now the choice has to be made as to which measure will cause the least harm to the public
 dilli main arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ke do saal puure hone vaale hai
 In such a situation, political conflict has also intensified
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha he ki kejariwal na sirf naakaam rahe hai, balki do saal puure hote-hote unki samvedanheenata bhi saamne aa gai he
 Tiwari said that Kejriwal is responsible for the death of 11 mentally ill children in Asha Kiran Home
 ye maut hatya he or kejariwal hatyare hai, kyonki sabakuch pataa hote hue bhi sarkaar ne bacchon ko marane diya
 Tiwari said the media took up the matter
 court ne aashaa kiran home ko lekar chintaa jataai or na sirf chintaa jataai balki nigaraanee ke liye samiti bhi banaai
 But the Delhi government will not get lice on its ears
 na khud koi kadam uthaaya or na hi kisi or ko kaam karne diya
 As a result, Asha Kiran continued to die one after another in the home, and despite being 11, shameless such that Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tried to make the whole case light
 manoj tiwari ne kahaaki dilli do saal main behaal ho gai he
 People in slums, slums, are forced to live a bad life
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh ne daawa kiya ki unke paas jhuggiyon main logon kii badahaali kii jeevant tasviren hai
 Which is revealing the claims of Kejriwal
 ye tasviren or video unhone 31 disambar se chal rahe jhuggi pravaas ke dauraan ikaitha kii hai
 This exposes the claims of Kejriwal's government and the promises made before the election
 jhuthe sabit hue dilli sarakar ke vaadebijapi ne daawaakia he ki emsidi chunaav ke baad half rate par bijli dene kaa vaada karne vaale kejariwal bijli companiyon kaa tarriff badhaane vaale hai
 So far, they have given subsidy money of about four thousand crores to the power companies, which is the money of the hard earned money of the people of Delhi, but the power companies are being looted
 jabaki kejariwal kaa daawa bijli ke rate aadhe karne kaa tha
 Similarly, the claim of water for free is also proving to be airborne because people are not getting water and people are craving for water
 pole kholane kaa daawakendriya mantri vijay goyal bhi pole khol abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne dilli bijepi ke mukhyalay pahunche or kejariwal sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki ab dilli sarkaar bhi janata ko jaankaree dene main munh mode rahi he
 To hide its failures, it is avoiding public questions
 lekin bijepi in naakaamiyon ko janata ke bich lekar ja rahi he
 It is obvious that on one hand the government is talking about counting its achievements, while the BJP is behind the Kejriwal government with food and water
 jisamen wo pole khol kaa daawa kar rahi he
