 salmaan khan bollywood ke aise 'dabang' hai jinase koi panga nahin lenaa chahta
 The example of Vivek Oberoi is in front of everyone, who was stopped even after getting a job in films after a ruckus with Salman
 lekin is baar kisi ne sabake saamne salmaan kii kirakiri kar di
 An unprecedented incident happened during a film award show in Mumbai on Thursday
 angreji akhbaar mubani mirar main chhapi ek khabar ke anusaar superstar salmaan khan or singer compoger mithun sharma main saikadon darshakon ke bich tu-tu main-main ho gai
 While Salman Khan was hosting the show, Mithun received the award for his song 'tum Hi Ho' from the film 'aashiqui-2'
 
 
 
 And according to Salman Khan, who was furious, when Mithun was speaking on stage after receiving the award, Salman interrupted him
 mithun kii peeth par ek kaagaj chipak gaya tha, jise lekar salmaan ne koi tippanee kii
 Mithun became very angry with this
 unhone chilla kar kaha, 'yah to hona hi tha kyonki yah shaam behad boring he or aapaki spich bhi
 As soon as Mithun said this, Salman lost his temper and started ordering Mithun to leave the hall
 salmaan ne chilla kar kaha, 'chal ja, nikal yahaan se
 'but Mithun was no less
 unhone bhi palat kar kaha ki salmaan sar main aapse nahin darataa
 Later, an eyewitness told the newspaper that during the show, Salman's comment backfired on him, due to which he got stung
 jaahir he kisi ne nahin sochaa tha ki koi salmaan khan ko saarvajanik sthaan par is tarah bolegaa
 This was a bad incident

 At the same time, Mithun later said that i did not tell Salman that he was boring
 main salmaan jaise senior actor ko aisa nahin kah saktaa
 Mithun confessed that Salman had asked him to leave the stage

 5 arab dollar ke sabase nichle str par pahunch gaya he
 So we (pakistan) have lost a big market

 Under the indo-iran-afghanistan agreement, India has expanded the port
 is vistaar se chabahaar bandargah kii kshamta teen guna badhane kii sambhaavna he
 Not only this, this port has been considered as a strategic response to the Gwadar port being extended under CPEC with the cooperation of China in neighboring country Pakistan
 bharat ke liye chabahaar bandargah isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki isse bharat ke liye pashchimi asia se pakistan ke dakhal ke bina sidhe judane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya 
 While the work of developing Gwadar, a coastal town in Balochistan province of Pakistan, started as a port in 2002
 pakistan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne guadar bandargah kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 Built at a cost of $ 24 million, the port was completed in 2007

 Under which China is also investing in the expansion of Gwadar Port
 chunki aarthik coridor yah rasta guadar se shuru hota he isliye guadar or is bandargah kaa is puri pariyojna main ahm sthaan he
 To revive an already cash-strapped Pakistan, former Commerce Minister Humayun Akhtar Khan believes that Islamabad needs to think differently to establish peace in the region and bring about a qualitative improvement in the economy

 analimited free 4G internet ke baad reliance jeeyo agle saal tak kuch or dhamaakedaar sarvice kii shuruyaat karne vaali he
 But according to reports, before this, the company is preparing to launch a cheap 4G LTE and volte support smartphone, which will cost only 1 thousand rupees
 jaahir he isamen welcome ofer ke tahat 4ji free 4ji internet or colling bhi hogi, kyonki khabar yah bhi he ki welcome ofer ko badha kar march tak kiya ja saktaa he
 It is reported that next year it can be introduced, which will be the cheapest 4G handset in the country and probably also of the world
 gauratlab he ki abhi bazaar main 4 hajaar rupee tak vaale4ji handset maujuud hai
 These include smartphones from Reliance Jio's company Lyf, which start at Rs 2,999
 chunki company pehle se saste 4G handset launch karti ai he to 1,000 yaa 1,500 rupee main agar nayaa 4ji handset launch ho bhi jaae to koi hairaani nahin hogi
 At present, no information has been given by the company, but it is being told that Spreadtrum 9820 processor will be given in it
 iske alaava isamen everej quality kaa camera, bluetooth, wifai or badi screen bhi hone kii ummid he
 Telecom operators across the country are preparing to start 4G and are gradually expanding their services to smaller cities after big cities
 or shaayad yahi vajah he ki bazaar main bhi 4G handset kii maang bad gai he
 According to Counter Point's research, in the third quarter of 2016, 7 out of 10 such smartphones have been sold in which 4G LTE support has been provided
 iske alaava 10 main 8 eltii smartphone main volte kaa bhi saport diya ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the tariff of Reliance Jio will start from December 31 and till then its services are being given free under the welcome offer
 company zyada se zyada customers batorna chaahati he or isliye jaahir he agar jinke paas 4G handset nahin hoga to jeeyo sim yuj nahin kar paaenge
 Therefore, by launching a smartphone as cheap as possible, the company wants to spread its SIM to the people

 After staying in the temple for about 25 minutes, the Prime Minister went to the place explaining the purpose of his presence
 unke baad ravidaas kii sharan main mattha techne dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal pahunche
 He did not taste the langar but took some prasad and spoke to the saints

 The girl, who is playing with the honor of the girl, is a resident of the village and is the cousin of the girl in the relationship
 yah dabang yuvak apni chacheri bahan ke saath chah maah se rape kar rahaa tha
 When he opened the girl's mouth, he used to threaten and silence her

 After that they beat and beat the young man a lot

 The girl's family was in favor of giving the case to the police, but some people in the village stopped her from doing so
 unhone panchayat ke jariye maamla sulajhane par jor diya
 This was followed by a panchayat at the junior high school of the village in the afternoon on Friday
 panchayat main panchon ne faisla sunaaya ki aaropee yuvak ke parivaaravaalon ko peedit ladqi ko dhai lakh rupee dene honge
 With this, the boy will no longer go towards the girl's house

 This time, illegal infiltration from across the border has been the biggest issue in Assam's Assembly elections
 lekin yah samasya kitni badi he ise jaanane ke liye india today kii special investigeshan team ne assam kaa daura kiya or janaa ki farji dastavejon ke jariye kisi videshi ke liye bhartiya naagarikta paanaa kitna aasaan he
 Foreigners will also vote
 The most disturbing thing that came up during the investigation was that some illegal immigrants, who have been officially declared as foreign by the tribunal but still have the right to vote
 to jab 11 april ko assam main duusare charan kaa matdaan hoga tab sirf bhartiya naagarik hi nahin balki bangladesh se aae kuch avaidh apravasi bhi vot denge
 India Today team visited Asam Kedhubari to find out how easy it is for Bangladeshi immigrants to get citizenship of India
 dhubari assam-bangladesh border ke ilaake main aata he
 Large part of this district is open due to Brahmaputra River
 jile main 75 pratishat muslim aabaadi he
 The population of Muslims in Assam and especially Dhubri is growing faster than the whole of India
 sthaneey logon kii shikaayat he ki kshetra main muslimon kii badhati aabaadi kii vajah bangladesh se hone vaali avaidh ghuspaith he
 How easy is it to get citizenship through fake documents? To find out the truth, India Today team first went to the District Transport Office
 jahaan sirf bharatiyon ke liye driving license banate hai
 But outside the office brokers, it does not matter much whether the licensee is Indian or Bangladeshi
 india today kii team abu tahab naam ke ek dalal se mili
 He was told that the one to be licensed is Bangladeshi
 dalal ne iske badale 10 hajaar rupee maange or kaha ki license dhubari ke pate par ban jayega
 The broker asked for 1 month time for this
 sirf dhubari main rahete hai 27 hajaar avaidh ghuspaithiebangladesh se assam aana kaaphi aasaan he
 Because the border fencing is almost impossible because of the Brahmaputra River
 kisi bhi apravasi ko sabase pehle naagarikta certificate kii jarurat hoti he, jo ki sirf 1 xxrep 4 0 rupee main uplabdh he
 Since 2013, the National Register of Citizens Office has been trying to find out the number of foreigners in the state
 india today kii team jab dhubari ke district offis of enarasi pahunchi to pataa laga ki bangladeshi apravasi dwaara farji dastavejon ke jariye naagarikta hasith karne ke kai maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 The NRC investigation found that there are 27 thousand illegal infiltrators in Dhubri district alone
 bataa den ki yah wo aankada he jo aadhikarik taur par daakhil he, asal main isse zyada sankhya main bangladeshi apravasi maujuud hai
 India Today team then visited Chirang district of Assam
 yahaan bhi sthiti lagbhag dhubari jaisi hi thi
 Berth certificates were available here for just 5 thousand rupees
 agar kisi ko farji skool living certificate banvaanaa ho to uske liye bhi 5 hajaar rupee or agar driving license banvaanaa ho to uske liye 3500 rupee chukaane honge
 What was most surprising was that the National Register of Citizens has detected many cases where illegal immigrants have been able to get genuine Indian voter cards

 He is yet to play the full 50 overs of the ODI match
 sahvaag ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki maine ekadivasiy cricket main kabhi 50 over nahin khele hai
 So far i have played 43 or 44 overs
 lekin is baar main 50 over tak ballebaaji or team ko acchhee shuruyaat dene kii koshish karuunga
 i have been trying to bat for 50 overs for the last 10 years and have failed, but the effort is still going on
 is baar kaaphi ummiden lagaai ja rahi hai, lekin sahvaag ne kaha ki vah dabaav mahasoos nahin kar rahe, kyonki captain mahendra singh dhoni or coach gairi karston ne unhen apana naiysargik khel khilne ko kaha he, bhale hi halaat kuch bhi hon
 Sehwag said, no one is telling me what i have to do, it is a good thing for our team
 coach or captain ne mujhe waisi ballebaaji karne ko kaha he, jaisi main karata hum
 So they are not putting any pressure on me
 unhone sirf itnaa kaha he ki apana naiysargik khel khelo
 If you can score runs, we will be happy, but even if you cannot do it, we will be happy
 sahvaag ne kaha, meri bhoomika krij par utarkar team ko acchhee shuruyaat karaane kii he
 If i score 20 runs in 10 balls or 100 runs in 70 or 80 balls, then i am happy with it
 is 32 varshiya kii style krij par utarate hi aakraamak ravaiya akhriyaar karne kii he, lekin sahvaag ne kaha ki unhone apni aakraamak pravriti ko thodaa kam kar diya he
 He said, i have been doing well for the last three years and i have also made some changes
 ab main nai gend ko thodaa sammaan detaa hum
 i make sure i play four-five overs before dominating the bowlers and then try to give the team a good start
 sahvaag ne kaha, main jaanata hum ki madhyakram main hamaare paas dhoni, viraat kohli, yusuf pathan, yuvaraj singh or suresh raina maujuud hai, isliye main pehali gend se aakraamak ho saktaa hum
 But now after playing three-four overs, i make sure that i give the team a good start
 vah test main bharat ke liye kaaphi ran bator chuke hai, lekin paanch divasiy mukaable kii tulana main vanade main unka record itnaa prabhavit karne vaala nahin he
 But the statistics have no impact on Sehwag and he says that his contribution is the only thing that is important for the success of the team
 unhone kaha, main vanade cricket main apane pradarshan se khush hum
 This is because everyone is talking about that my test average is 54, while the ODI average is just 35, but that does not make my performance worse
 sahvaag ne kaha, haa maine jo pradarshan kiya he, main usase behatar kar saktaa hum, lekin main khush hum
 i am constantly focusing on doing well in ODI cricket
 lekin jab tak main team ke liye yogadan karata hum, main khush hum
 Asked if he had fully recovered from the shoulder injury, he said, "I am taking regular treatment and hopefully i will recover completely
" kandhe kii chot kii chintaaon ke baavjood unhone kaha ki vah vishwa cap main gendbaaji karenge, lekin puri tarah se feet hone ke baad hi vah aisa karenge
 He said, i definitely want to bowl
 main team india ke liye yogadan dena chahta hum

 keshav puri ne kaha ki ram mandir banegaa tabhi yah sarkaar tiki rahegi, nahin to mushkil lagata he, kyonki logon kaa vishwaas uth jayega
 Mahant Keshav Puri says that we want the temple to be built and only then BJP can be formed again, or else i find it very difficult because Hindu society is connected with BJP

 On one hand Jai does not give importance to anything other than his career, on the other hand Diya gives importance to career as well as all the happiness like family and marriage
 achaanak shaadi se do din pehle neend main jai apane bhavishya main chalaa jaataa he, vah budhaape tak pahunch jaataa he jahaan sab use bichade hue nazar aate hai
 It will not be right to talk about the story further, because the fun of the story will end
 is film kaa concept yaa script sunne main to shaayad acha laga ho, lekin nirdeshak nitya mehara film ko parade par thik se nahin utaar paae
 Technically speaking, Nitya might be appreciated for running the story in future and past, but it will take time for the general audience to understand all this
 film main manoranjan kii khaasi kami he
 Siddharth too did not look special in this character
 nirmaataa karan johar kaa hathiyaar kahe jane vaale imotional drishy bhi ikkaa-dukka hai or jo hai ve bhi dil ko nahin choote
 The comments film kii achchhaayiyon kii agar baat karen to vah iskaa vishay he
 The film tells that if you see the future of your love, will you try to rectify your mistakes? The film also states that no calculation is perfect without balance
 beetaa hua kal haath se nikal gaya or aane vaale kal kaa kuch pataa nahin ki kya lekar aayega isliye aaj ke palon ko behatar banaao
 Katrina Kaif is frozen in her role and the music of the film has already been a hit before its release
 ek lav story ko alag tarah se banane kii koshish kii gai he magar patakatha kamazor pad gai
 Once you see 'baar Baar Dekho', that will be enough for the film
 isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2 star
 Suddenly two days before the wedding, Jai goes to sleep in his future, he reaches old age where he is seen by all
 isse aage kahani par baat karnaa sahi nahin hoga, kyonki kahani kaa majaa khatm ho jayega
 It may have been nice to hear the concept or script of this film, but director Nitya Mehra could not put the film on screen properly
 agar takneekee taur par dekhen to kahani ko bhavishya or bhootkaal main daudane ke liye shaayad nitya kii saraahna ho, magar aam darshak ko yah sab samajhane main samay lagegaa
 The film lacks a lot of entertainment
 siddharth bhi is kirdaar main kuch khaas nahin lage
 Emotional scenes called producer Karan Johar's weapon are also isolated and those that do not touch the heart
 tippaniyan If we talk about the goodness of the film then it is the subject of it
 film bataati he ki agar aap apane prem ke bhavishya ko dekh len to kya aap apni galatiyon ko sudhaarney kii koshish karenge? film yah bhi bataati he ki balance ke bina koi bhi gananaa parfect nahin hoti
 Yesterday was out of hand and tomorrow, there is no idea what will come, so make today's moments better
 katrina kaiff apane role main jami hai or film kaa sangeet release se pehle hi hit ho chukaa he
 An attempt has been made to make a love story differently but the screenplay weakened
 'baar-baar dekho' ko aap ek baar dekh len vahi film ke liye kaaphi hoga
 So my rating for this film is 2 stars

 grih mantralay ne shanti ke makasad se ramajaan ke maheene main sijafire lagu kiya tha, lekin aatankiyon ne apane napak mansoobon se is par pani pher diya
 The way conditions have been created in the valley in the last few days, it will not be easy to overcome them
 sena ke liye aane vaale dinon main ab teen morchon par khud ko majbootee se pesh karnaa hoga
 Significantly, the central government has decided not to extend the unilateral ceasefire announced in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday amid the violence perpetrated by the terrorists
 yah sangharshaviram ramajaan ke paak maheene ke dauraan rajya main 16 may ko ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Please tell that between May 17 and June 14, a total of 62 terrorist incidents took place in Jammu and Kashmir
 modi sarkaar ko chaar saal puure ho gaye hai or ye mauka he jab is avadhi main sarkaar ke kaarykaal par najar daalkar parkhaa jaae ki alag-alag muddon par usne kya or kitna kaam kiya
 If it is talked about a large population of the country i
e
 the Muslim community, then the Modi government took many such decisions which will bring major changes in the society and the country
 duusari ore in chaar saal main alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf hinsa or daman ke bhi kai maamle saamne aae jinamein modi sarkaar ke rukh par sawaal uthe
 The Congress and other parties' governments have always shied away from handing over important issues related to the Muslims of the country
 vahiin, modi sarkaar ne apane chaar saal ke shashan main muslimon ko lekar bold kadam uthaae hai
 Then whether it is the matter of enacting a law against triple talaq or the decision to abolish the Haj subsidy in one stroke
 piem modi or unke mantri khuleam kehete hai ki sarkaar tushtikaran par nahin balki shashaktikaran kii raah par chalegi
 Haj Subsidy Abolition Like Muslims of the world, Muslims of India also go to Saudi Arabia for Haj
 bhartiya hajiyon kii yatra ke kharch kaa bada hissaa centre sarkaar sabsidi ke rup main khud vahan karti thi
 On the demand of Muslim organizations, the Supreme Court had ordered the gradual abolition of Haj subsidy but the Modi government completely abolished the Haj subsidy in one stroke
 sarkaar ke is faisle kaa musalamaanon ke bade tabake ne swaagat kiya, jabaki kuch log isse naaraaz bhi hue, lekin bijepi or sarkaar kisi bhi tarah ke virodh se beparwaah dikhi
 The Billmody government against triple talaq has pledged to rid Muslim women of triple talaq
 teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar iske liye sajaa mukarrar karne sambandhi vidheyak ko 15 disambar ko cabinet kii manjuuri mili or 28 disambar ko loksabhaa ne ise paas bhi kar diya
 However, due to lack of majority of NDA in Rajya Sabha, this bill is stuck
 modi sarkaar ke is kadam se jahaan muslim mahilaayein khush najar ain to muslim sanghathanon ne vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ko lekar naaraazgi jaahir kii
 But irrespective of the protest, the government can also bring an ordinance on the hanging of the bill, which provides for the punishment of a Muslim husband for granting triple talaq
 alpsankhyakon par bade hamalemodi ke satta main aate hi desh main alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf ek maahaul banane kii koshish dekhi gai
 The Modi government repeatedly appeared in the dock over violence against minorities
 piem modi kaa 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kaa naaraa mahaj naaraa banakar rah gaya
 Akhlaq in Dadri and in Alwar, the aspect of Khyar Khan was killed with a cow and people associated with the government and the party were seen rescuing the accused
 jharkhand, haryana, rajasthan sahit desh ke kai hisson main gorakshakon dwaara hinsak ghatnaayen anjaam di gayi
 In the same way, Muslim youth were targeted by raising the jinn of love jihad
 rajasthan ke hi rajsamand main afrajul naamak ek shaks kii hatya kar uskaa live video banaaya gaya
 'human Rights Watch', while releasing 'world Report 2018', made a strong comment about the Modi government
 report main kaha gaya he ki ye sarkaar desh main alpsankhyakon par hamalon ko nahin roak saki
 There is a ruckus on the picture of Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University or an attempt to abolish the minority status of Jamia Millia Islamia
 modi sarkaar alpsankhyakon ko ye bharosa dene main naakaam rahi ki uske raaj main unki janmaal or adhikaar surakshit hai
 The opposition has put the government and BJP in the dock over this and has been alleging that the Modi government is following the Hindutva agenda of the RSS
 lekin sarkaar ko isaki parvaah he aisa koi sanket uski taraf se nahin mila he

 State Finance Minister Thomas Issac said that this is not the method of CPM and there has been a mistake in this matter
 rahul gandhi ko ‘amul baby’ kah chuke varisht marxvaadi netaa ve es achyutanandan ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh bachche jaisaa bartaav kar rahe hai or vah halaat se nipat nahin paa rahe hai
 He said, 'if Rahul Gandhi is contesting from Wayanad, what will change? The Left party will have to fight Rahul and BJP together
 ’CPM leader & former Kerala CM VS Achuthanandan in his Facebook post: i called Rahul Gandhi 'amul Baby' earlier, because of his attitude of approaching situations without understanding them

 vahiin, congress party ne daawa kiya ki uske 5 vidhayak laapata hai
 The Congress also alleged that the BJP has launched another Operation Lotus in Karnataka
 aapako bataa den ki oparation lotus kaa istemaal sabase pehle saal 2008 main hua tha
 At that time, the BJP was accused that opposition mlas were being targeted for stabilizing the Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka
 It is a matter of shame that@pmoindia@narendramodiand@bjp4indiachief@amitshahare doing their best to destabilise the coalition government in Karnataka and install a BJP regime through unconstitutional means
 The people will teach them a lesson during the Lok Sabha elections

 Pressing them after washing is a huge task
 haalanki dhobi ko kapade dekar is kaam se raahat to paayi ja sakati he lekin dhobi ko kapade dene main kai tarah ke jokhim bhi hote hai
 Many times it happens that the washerman does not return clothes on time or sometimes he spoils clothes
 aise main zyaadaatar log dhobi ko kapade dene ke bajaay khud hi kapade press karnaa pasand karte hai
 If you also press your clothes at home, then these measures can be useful for you
 in upayon ko apanaakar aap kam vakt or kam mehnat main zyada kapade press kar sakate hai:1
 It is better to spray a clean towel before spraying it on every cloth
 use baad use halke haathon se nichod len
 All the clothes you want to press, wrap them neatly in that towel
 isse ek-ek kapade ko spray karne kii jarurat nahin padegi or saare kapadon main halki nami aa jaaegi
 The way the clothes press well after spraying, the same will happen after wrapping them in towels
 2
 Drying clothes in the dryer can also save you time
 slo spin par kapadon ko sukhaane se unamem bahut adhik sikudan nahin aati he
 Due to which they do not have to work very hard while pressing
 3
 Folding clothes properly after washing is also very important
 agar dhone ke baad aapane kapadon ko yun hi modakar rakh diya to wo or adhik sikud jaaenge
 It is very important to keep them in such a manner
 4
 After washing clothes, do not put them directly on the rope when they have to be sunlighted
 isse pehle kapade ko donon haathon se pakadakar jhatak len
 This will make them straight to a large extent
 is tarah se sukhaae gaye kapade jaldi press ho jate hai
 5
 har kapade ko press karne kaa tarika hota he
 The cloth should spread all over, starting from one edge and reaching the other corner
 bich-bich main se press karne se kapade sahi se press nahin ho pate hai or vakt bhi zyada lagata he

 bhartiya cricket team ke purv salaami ballebaaj or vartmaan main chunaav jeetne ke baad punjab main mantri banaae gaye navjot singh siddhu ke TV sho kaa hissaa hone par jari siyaasi bavaal thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh may have given a green signal to Navjot Singh Sidhu to work in a TV show following the advice of the Advocate General of Punjab, but opposition parties like the Akali Dal are constantly opposing him
 ve mantri pad kii garima or naitikta kii duhai dene ke saath-saath kai sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 As a minister, he has been protesting when Kapil is part of the laughter show
 darasal, pichley do hafte se navjot singh siddhu kapil sharma ke sho main jaj kii kursi par baith rahe hai
 In such a situation, the comedians of the show make fun of his ministerial position
 koi hasya kalakaar navjot singh siddhu ko kahata he ki aap kaaphi bade ministar ban gaye hai
 Recommend them
 unhen naukari dilava dijie
 So at the same time, any comedian demands Navjot Singh Sidhu to get the red light
 is puure hansi-majaak ke dauraananvjot singh siddhuke mantri pad kaa zikr sho main chutkulon ke taur par kiya jaataa he
 The Akali Dal leaders have reminded Navjot Singh Sidhu of the dignity and morality of the post of ministers
 akali dal ke senior netaaon ne jataayi aapatteekali dal ke senior leader or purv mantri bikram singh majithia or purv vitt mantri parminder singh dhindsa ne kaha ki bhale hi kanoon ke tahat navjot singh siddhu ke tivi sho karne par roak naa ho lekin ek mantri kii naitikta or garima ko dekhte hue navjot singh siddhu ke is tarah se apane mantri pad kaa majaak banavaane se bachanaa chahie
 Both said that they are very sorry to see all this and Sidhu should leave such TV shows on the basis of morality
 captain amarinder pratikriya dene se bachate rahepunjab sarkaar bhi is puure maamle par jari bavaal ko khatm karnaa chaahati he
 For this reason, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu themselves are refraining from saying anything on this whole matter
 jab akali dal kii naitikta ke sawaal par captain amarinder singh se poocha gaya to captain ne baat ko ghuma diya or kehane lage ki abhi sarkaar ko bane mahaj ek haftaa hi hua he
 It is not appropriate to question the functioning of the government right now
 vahiin apane badbolepan ke liye charchit navjot singh siddhu bheekaali dal ke naseehatdiye jane ke sawaal par khamosh rahe or unhone bhi in tamaam sawaalon se kanni kaat lee
 Congress spokesperson defends Sidhu, Congress MLA from Sangrur and AICC spokesman Vijay Inder Singla defended Sidhu, saying that Sidhu should do anything in his professional life, but if he does not discharge his ministerial position or in his work Such questions should be raised only if someone is taken care of
 unhone akali dal kii naseehat ko unki hataasha qaraar diya
 Both Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu are trying to see that this TV show controversy is over now and people bypassing the work of their TV shows and assess them for the work done during their ministerial post
 
 haalanki aisa lagata lagata nahin ki aane vaale dinon main bhi ye TV sho vivaad navjot singh siddhu kaa peechha chhodane vaala he

 vaise to tii-20 international main bharat kaa bangladesh ke khilaaf jeet kaa record 100% he, lekin donon deshon ke bich bahut romaanchak or kantedaar mukaable dekhne ko mili hai
 One such memorable match was in the 2016 T20 World Cup
 is match ne darshakon ke dilon kii dhadakanen badha di thim
 On 23 March 2016, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of Team India presented such a sample of his cool temperament which is being discussed till date
 world tii-20 2016 main bangladesh ke khilaaf 'karo yaa maro' kaa match tha, jisamen bangladesh kii jeet lagbhag tay najar aa rahi thi
 But, Dhoni had something else approved
 dhoni ne bangladesh ko rulaayabengalooru ke maidan par tii-20 worldcup kaa match khelaa gaya tha
 In which Team India scored 146 for 7 wickets while batting first
 147 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karne utari bangladesh kii team ke wicket bhi lagaataar antaraal par girte rahe
 However, the goal was not too large
 bangladesh ne 6 wicket ganvaakar 19wein over tak 136 ran bana liye the
 Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah were playing at the crease
 lag rahaa tha ki bangladesh kii team ye match aasaani se apane naam kar legi
 But, Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not let this happen
 aakhri over main match kaa rukh badal gaya
 Mushfiqur Rahim was caught out on the fourth ball
 vahiin paanchavin gend par mahamudullah bhi kaich out hue
 Team Indians did not let Bangladesh score 2 runs in the last 3 balls
 is match main antim gend par bangladesh ko do ranon kii darkaar thi
 Suwagata could not reach the ball thrown outside Pandya's off stump and ran for a by-run
 jaise hi gend dhoni ke paas ai or vah wicket kii ore mustafijur rahamaan ko ran out karne ke liye daud pade
 Showing lightning speed, Dhoni dismissed Mustafizur
 is tarah bharat yah match ek ran ke antar se jeet gaya
 Bangladesh team will play a T20 International for the second time against India on Indian soil
 aakhri baar bharat kii dharti par donon timen 2016 tii-20 world cap ke isi match main aamane-saamne thim
 India won the match thanks to a brilliant runout from Dhoni's last ball, which saved India's hopes in the 2016 T20 World Cup
 kab-kab khele jaaenge tii-20 mukaable?bataa den ki teen maichon kii tii-20 siries kaa pehla muqabla nai dilli kirun jetali stadiumme khelaa jayega
 After this, both teams will play the second T20 in Rajkot on 7 November and the third T20 in Nagpur on 10 November
 south africa ke khilaaf pichhali tii-20 siries main team india ko 1-1 ke drow nattejey se santosh karnaa padaa tha, lekin bangladesh ke khilaaf team india teen maichon kii tii-20 siries ke sabhi match jeetna chaahegi
 Pakistan has admitted that the timing of Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit's meeting with Hurriyat leaders was not entirely correct
 yaad rahe ki hurriyat netaaon ke saath basit kii bhent kii vajah se bharat ne videsh sachiv str kii vaarta radd kar di thi jo 25 agast ko islamabad main honi thi
 Sartaj Aziz praised Modi's speech at the UN
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashan main jo sakaaratmak baat lagi, jab unhone kaha ki vah pakistan samet apane padosi deshon se rishte sudhaarna chaahate hai
 "hurriyat is also a stakeholder," Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan's national security and foreign affairs advisor, told Exclusive Talk to Headlines Today, "we will not give up the right to talk to Hurriyat
" haalanki hai-kamishnar ke saath meeting kii jo timming thi, use ham gaiyr-jaruri kah sakate hai
 The timing is correct, but the basic thing is that whenever Kashmir is concerned, we will have to deal with them (from Hurriyat)
 ham kashmir masale ko nahin chhod sakate, kyonki is maamle main wo (hurriyat) bhi ek steke holder he
 "india to restore the dialogue" Sartaj Aziz said that the meeting between Pakistan diplomats and Hurriyat leaders has been happening for the last 30 years and there was nothing new in it
 unhone kaha, chunki bharat ne baatcheet ko suspend kiya he, isliye use behaal karne kaa jimmaa bhi bharat kaa he
 He said, 'we hoped that the two leaders would meet
 dono deshon ke netaaon ke milane se samvaad ko gati milti he
 It depends on India
 agar bharat pahal karata he to hamen uskaa intjaar he
 "he said," Perhaps the timing was not entirely right in this matter because the remarkable talks on Kashmir were yet to begin
 unhone kaha ki videsh sachiv str kii bhentvaarta main dwipaksheeya vaarta ke agenda kii ghoshnaa honi thi
 'no talks should have been canceled,' however Sartaj Aziz also termed India's decision to cancel Foreign Secretary level talks as unfair
 unhone kaha, 'meeting radd karnaa acha faisla nahin tha
 This was not such a big issue that the talk of the secretaries of the two countries should be canceled
 'unhone kaha ki jo baithak radd hui thi, use phir se shuru kiya jaae, jisase donon deshon ke rishte behatar hon
 It is a good thing for all the countries of the world to have good relations between India and Pakistan
 kashmiri avam ko maanya ho samaadhansanyukt raashtra main pakistani piem navaj sharif ke bayaan kaa bachaav karte hue sartaaj ne kaha ki kashmir kaa samaadhaan vahaan ke logon ko bhi maanya hona chahie, isliye piem navaj ne vahaan ke logon kii raay maaloom karne kii baat kahi
 He also said that we did not include any third in this conversation
 unhone kaha ki ham rishte behatar karne ke liye gambhir samvaad karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said, 'everyone wants to have better relations
 lekin army kaa apana kaam he
 Their job is to protect the country
 pakistani army ko lekar jo aam paracepshan he wo thik nahin he
 'he said,' We have assured the army that our army has to prepare in the same way as the defense prepared for Rat
 'kamjor padegaa imran kaa andolansartaaj ajij pakistan main kadri or imran khan kii aguwai main hue virodh pradarshnon par bhi bole
 He said that in the long run both Nawaz Sharif and democracy in Pakistan will be strong
 puri parliament ne navaj sharif kaa ekajute hokar saath diya
 Even opposition parties have made it clear that they will not allow democracy to be weakened for any reason
 unhone kaha, 'navaj sharif sahab ne hamaare buniyadi muddon kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii har sambhav koshish kii he
 The protests of a few thousand people will slowly start to weaken

 Not only this film, but Neerja herself has now become a part of my life
 aaj ke daur main dayaa bhav bahut kam ho chukaa he, or neeraja ke jivan se mujhe yah dayabhav seekhney ko mila
 Comments sonam ne kaha, 'sabhi ke jivan main sahanubhuti, dayalutaa or samajhadaari kaa bahut ahm sthaan he
 Especially in the current era, when there is an atmosphere of jealousy and hatred all around
 
 The patience, kindness and love shown by a 22 year old girl is unbearable for all of us

 After receiving the award in place of Neerja Bhanot on Sunday at the Mother Teresa International Award-2016 ceremony, Sonam said, 'this film became the carrier of a big change in my life
 sirf yah film hi nahin balki neeraja khud ab mere jivan kaa hissaa ban chuki hai
 In today's era, compassion has reduced a lot, and i got to learn this kindness from Neerja's life

 ) ek adhyayan se pataa laga he ki mahilaon main hi maa banane kii khwaahish nahin hoti, balki purush bhi ‘baap ’ banane kii teevr ichha rakhte hai
 It is a different matter that men prefer sex more than this desire
 research kii kasuti par rishton kaa sach
 
 
 What is there in 'kamasutra' 
 
 kansas state uniwarsity ke ek dal ke anusaar ‘baby fever ’ (bachche kii khwaahish) aamtaur par mahilaon se vabsta he, lekin purush bhi isse achoote nahin rahete
 Quoting Gerry Brass, the leader of the study team, the Daily Mail said, "there was a perception about the Bevie Fever that people suddenly have a desire for children
" ise aksar mahilaon se joda jaataa tha, lekin hamane paaya ki purushon ke maamle main bhi yahi baat he
 "be loyal, not 'bewafa Sanam'
" 
 
 |pyaar-bharaa chumbaipane adhyayan main anusandhankartaaon ne teen binduon ko liya
 The first is the socio-cultural aspect
 log isaliye baccha chaahate hai ki unhen kutumb ke bare main padhaaya jaataa he
 Women want children because society expects them to be mothers
 doosraa kaaran he pati patni ke ansh kii avadharana
 When they see a beautiful baby, they are attracted to it and they want to have a child of their own
 teesraa he bhavatmak kaaran
 Indication from one part of the brain to another that it is a good time for the child
 professor brase ne kaha, ‘‘kabhi aapako bachche kii chaah hoti he, kabhi aap chaahate hai ki aapke paas dhan ho athwa aapako prasiddhi mili athwa sex chaahate hai
 We asked people in what order these wishes are
 anusandhankartaaon ne paaya ki baby fever purush or mahila donon main tha
 If the woman wanted more children than sex, then the thinking of men was the opposite
 logon se yah bhi poocha gaya ki bachche kii chaah hone athwa uski ichha nahin hone kii kya vajah he
 The first was a positive reason
 masalan bachche ko baahon main lenaa, uski dekhbhaal uske kapadey-khilone kii chintaa
 The second negative emotion, such as the crying of children and changing its napkin, etc
 teesraa pahalu tha bachche hone se uski shiksha, kariyar, dhan or saamaajik jivan se jude sawaal
 According to Professor Brass, he saw both positive and negative aspects
 unke anusaar ‘‘phir ve log the, jo sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak pahalu donon se prabhavit the or kaaphi uljhan main the
 But the reason for producing children remained
 hamaari peedhee ko aage badhanaa
 Big news has come for those wishing to buy or build a home
 nae awaas mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha he ki home lone par byaaj kii daren ghataane ke liye vah prayaas karenge taaki 2020 tak sabhi ko awaas ke lakshya ko puraa kiya ja sake
 After assuming the charge of his Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, he said that if we have to provide homes to all, it is necessary to do so
 unhone kaha ki 2020 tak sabhi ko awaas dilaanaa hamaari variyata hogi
 He said that the previous NDA government under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee raised the interest rates to 10
 5 pratishat salanaa se ghataakar 7
 5 percent was brought in annually
 unhone kaha ki aaj phir byaaj dar 10 pratishat se upar he, main is maamle ko vitt mantri ke paas le jaaoongaa
 Housing is a priority sector and i am deeply attached to it
 unhone kaha ki jeenenaryuarem ko nayaa rup diya jayega

 In fact, the state's Chief Minister Narendra Modi reacted sharply to the issue
 sibiai ke varisht vakil keties tulsi ne is maamle main gujarat ke purv mantri amit shah kii jamaanat arji kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ek adaalat main kaha, ‘hamane apni ore se saunpi gai sthiti report main ucchtam nyaayalay se is maamle ko (soharabuddin shaikh farji muthbhed maamle ko) gujarat se baahar bhejne kii maang nahin kii thi
 'it is worth mentioning that on July 30, the CBI submitted the status report of this six month old investigation in a closed envelope to the Supreme Court
 sutron ke mutabik is report main sibiai ne gujarat main nishpaksh sunwaayee ho paane ko lekar andeh jataayaa tha, jisapar modi ne tikhi pratikriya vyakt kii thi or centre ko aade haath lete hue kaha tha ki yah rajya kii nyaayik prakriya kii beijjati he
 Modi had said, 'I want to ask the central government, tell me, do you consider Gujarat a part of India or not? Why is Gujarat being treated like an enemy state? ' Significantly, Shah was arrested two weeks ago by the CBI in this fake encounter case on charges of murder, kidnapping and extortion
 ahmedabad ke paas 25 november 2005 ko shaikh kii kathith taur par ek farji muthbhed main hatya kar di gai thi

 aap apni tasviren yahaan dekh sakate hai:tweets by @aajtak Bal Thackeray has issued a new decree if the Thackeray family is not filled with cursing Rahul Gandhi
 bal thakare ne rahul gandhi ke maharashtra daure ke dauraan kaala jhanda dikhaane ke liye shivasainikon ko likhaa he
 Earlier, Bal Thackeray's nephew and MNS chief Raj Thackeray had said in his speech yesterday that where was Romputra Rahul Gandhi when the agitations were taking place in Mumbai
 apane bhaashan main raaj thakare ne marathi maanush kaa hitaishi hone kii daavedaari karte hue desh kii akhandta or ekta ko bhi daanv par laga diya
 Raj's unbridled tongue was threatening rebellion
 raaj thakare ne maharashtra ko alag karne tak kii baat kah daali
 Earlier, Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray had strongly reprimanded Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main chape ek lekh main uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki rahul gandhi ne mumbai hamale ke dauraan enesji main shaamil bihar or upi ke javaanon kaa zikr kar un veeron kaa apmaan kiya he jo aatanki hamale main shahid ho gaye
 Uddhav Thackeray said that Marathi heroes like Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte and Tukaram Ombale have insulted the martyrs
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko rahul gandhi ne bihar ke darbhanga main chaatro ko sambodhan ke dauraan kaha tha ki shivasena or emenes ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki aatanki hamale main enesji ke jin commando ne aatankiyon ko post kiya tha, unamem se kai upi or bihar ke the
 In the party mouthpiece Saamana, Bal Thackeray wrote in an editorial that Rahul's horn seems to have come out
 bal thakare ne apane lekh main kaha tha ki shaadi na hone ke kaaran rahul gandhi rogi ho gaye hai
 Rahul has insulted Maharashtra and the martyrs
 unhone sawaal khadaa kiya ki kya rahul hamen kashmir main basaayenge?thakare parivaar ke bayanon ko lekar raajnneeti galiyaaron main tikhi pratikraya hui
 Maharashtra Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam said that action should be taken against Raj Thackeray for making inflammatory statements
 purv kanoon mantri ramjethamlani kaa kahana he raaj thakare ne jo bayaan diya he uske mutabik raaj thakare par gambhir maamla ban saktaa he lekin ye tab sambhav jab maharashtra sarkaar raaj thakare ke khilaaf karrwai kii manshaa dikhaae
 Bal Thackeray, who once spread the fire of hatred against South Indians, is now spewing venom against North Indians in the name of Marathi Manus
 abhi tak uttar bharatiyon ke khilaaf nafrat failaa kar raajnneeti kii seedhia chadhne vaale unka bhatija raaj thakare ne jataa diya ki maharashtra ke aage raashtra kitna myne rakhata he

 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa 93 saal kii umr main guuruuvaar ko nidhan ho gaya
 For the last two months, he was admitted to AIIMS in Delhi and was placed on full life support
 bijepi ko shunya se shikhar tak le jane vaale netaaon main atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa naam aata he
 He has set two records
 atalji ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karanjansangh, janata party or baad main bijepi kii neenv rakhane vaale chehron main se ek naotal bihari vaajapeyika bhi he
 The BJP was formed on 6 April 1980, as a political party in the first Lok Sabha elections, the party had only two seats in its account
 iske baavjood vaajapeyi ne haar nahin maani or unhone kaha tha, 'andhera chantega, suraj nikalegaa, camel khilegaa
 'the result of this is that at the present time there are BJP governments in 20 states of the country from the power of the Center
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa janm 25 disambar 1924 ko hua, is din ko bharat main bada din kaha jaataa he
 He had distanced himself from active politics since 2008 due to poor health
 vaajapeyi apane sansadeey jivan main 10 baar loksabhaa ke sadsy bane or do baar rajyasabha ke sadsy rahe
 Vajpayee has established such a record in Indian politics, which is a milestone in itself
 ve chaar rajyon ke 6 loksabhaa siton se chunakar sansad pahunchane vaale eklaute rajaneta hai
 However, he had to face defeat in the first Lok Sabha elections of 1952
 iske baad 1962, 1967 or 1984 main maat mili thi
 When the BJP made an entry in the political history of the country, hardly anyone would have thought at that time that one day the party would be taking power in half of the country
 bijepi ko shunya se shikhar tak pahunchane main vaajapeyi ne sabase ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Vajpayee entered politics in 1942, when his brother went to jail for 23 days during the Quit India Movement
 1951 main vaajapeyi ne aresas ke sahyog se bhartiya jansangh party banaai jisamen shyama prasad mukherjee jaise netaa shaamil hue
 In 1957, Vajpayee became a member of Rajya Sabha for the first time by winning the election from Balrampur parliamentary seat
 vaajapeyi ke asaadhaaran vyaktitv ko dekhakar us samay ke vartmaan pradhanmantripandit jawaharlal nehrune kaha tha ki aane vaale dinon main yah vyakti jarur pradhanmantri banegaa
 In 1968, Vajpayee became the National President of the National Jana Sangh
 us samay party ke saath nanaaji deshmukh, balraj madhok tathaa laalkrishna adwani jaise netaa the
 Vajpayee was arrested along with other leaders during the Emergency in 1975-77 when he was criticizing Indira Gandhi for the Emergency
 1977 main janata party ke mahanayake jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main apatkaal kaa virodh ho rahaa tha
 After his release from jail, Vajpayee merged the Jan Sangh with the Janata Party
 1977 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main janata party kii jeet hui thi or ve morarji bhai desai ke netritv vaali sarkaar main videsh mantri bane
 After becoming the foreign minister, Vajpayee was the first leader to address the United Nations Federation in Hindi
 janata party kii sarkaar 1979 main gir gai, lekin us samay tak vaajapeyi ne apni ek anbhavi netaa va vaktaa ke rup main pahchaan bana lee
 After this, the Janata Party disintegrated due to infighting and in 1980 the old friends along with Vajpayee left the Janata Party and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party
 vaajapeyi bijepi ke pehle rashtriya adhyaksh bane or ve congress sarkaar ke sabase bade aalochakon main shumaar kiye jane lage
 In 1994, when the party won elections in Karnataka, 1995 in Gujarat and Maharashtra, then the then President of the party, LK Advani, declared Vajpayee as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 vaajapeyi 1996 se lekar 2004 tak 3 baar pradhanmantri bane
 In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP emerged as the largest party in the country and Vajpayee became the Prime Minister for the first time
 haalanki unki sarkaar 13 dinon main sansad main purna bahumat hasil nahin karne ke chalate gir gai
 In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the party won more seats and with the support of some other parties, Vajpayee formed the NDA and he again became the Prime Minister
 yah sarkaar 13 maheenon tak chali, lekin bich main hi jayalalita kii party ne sarkaar kaa saath chhod diya jiske chalate sarkaar gir gai
 The BJP returned to power in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and this time Vajpayee completed his term
 vienna ke ek gurudware main hamale main bharat ke sikh panth ke ek sheersh netaa kii maut or anya ke ghayal hone ke maamle main police ne 6 aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya he or unki pahchaan avaidh apravasiyon ke rup main kii gayi he

 The attack on the Gandhi family has intensified after the conviction of Sajjan Kumar, the Congress' strong leader in the Sikh riots
 aam aadmi party ne rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna waapas lene kii baat par vivaad thama bhi nahin he ki akali supremeo sukhbir badal ne piem se maang kar di he ki gandhi parivaar ke naam tamaam hawaii addon or anya saarvajanik sarkari sthalon se hataa die jaaen
 With this, the Bharat Ratna given to Rajiv Gandhi should be withdrawn
 sukhbir badal ne kaha ki sajjan kumaar ko dilli hoicourt se sajaa hone ke baad ab ye saaf ho chukaa he ki apane netaaon ke madhyam se gandhi parivaar ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dange karwaae the or aise pariwaron se jude logon ke naam kisi hawaii adde yaa anya sarkari saarvajanik sampatti par nahin honi chahie
 He said that neither Rajiv Gandhi has any right to be called Bharat Ratna
 sukhbir badal ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal ne jis tarah se pehle dilli vidhansabha se rajeev gandhi ko diya bharat ratna waapas liye jane kaa prastaav paarit karvaa diya or baad main congress ke dabaav main palat gaye usase saaf he ki arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party congress ke dabaav main hai or donon main koi bhi fark nahin he
 He claimed that soon an alliance of these two parties is going to happen
 sukhbir badal ne bataaya ki captain amarinder singh ne 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon ke baad congress se istipha de diya tha lekin ab yahi captain amarinder singh congress or gandhi parivaar ke paksh main khadey hai
 It is clear that Captain Amarinder Singh has nothing to do with the interests of the Sikhs and Sikhism
 He only has meaning from his Chief Minister's chair because if he speaks anything against the Gandhi family, then he is removed from the Chief Minister's chair
 Will go
 isse pehle akali dal ke mahasachiv or pravaktaa dow
 Daljit Singh Cheema had said that after the Delhi court sentenced Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment for the 1984 anti-sikh riots accused, the rioters had political protection
 sajjan kumaar ke bayanon se sabit ho chukaa he ki rajeev gandhi ko na keval dangon kii jaankaree thi balki unhone ek bayaan main yahaan tak kaha tha ki jab bada ped girtaa he to jameen hilti he
 The captain also targeted the captain
 dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki captain amarinder singh baar-baar sikh virdohi dangon ke liye congress ko clin chit dete aae hai
 He said that Captain repeatedly says that Rahul Gandhi was a child during the riots but does not consider 22-year-old Sukhbir Badal, who was studying in America at the time, innocent
 is masale par akali dal vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaanaa chaahati he, iskaa jawaab dete hue congress ne kaha he ki akali dal dharmik granthon kii brudabi ke maamle par baikfoot par he isliye vyarth ke maamle uthaakar akali netaa punjab ke asli muddon se dhyaan hataanaa chaahate hai

 Azad said that we want elections in the state
 i said this afternoon also that it's a suggestion & no final decision has been taken yet (on pdp-nc-congress alliance)

 The governor should have explored all possibilities first

 'sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, vidhansabha bhang karne se pehle rajyapal satyapal malik ne centre sarkaar ko jammu kashmir kii haalat bataai
 a report has also been sent to the Union Ministry in this regard

 Mehbooba Mufti wrote the letter to the Governor only when NC and Congress spoke to support him
 aise main rajyapal ko mahabuuba mufti ko ek mauka dena chahie
 What did Ghulam Nabi Azad say about dissolving Jammu and Kashmir assembly, Azad alleged that BJP does not want anyone other than him to form government in Jammu and Kashmir
 yahi vajah he ki afvaahon se darkar jammu kashmir vidhansabha ko bhang kar diya gaya
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that there could be no reason to dissolve the assembly suddenly and when fearing rumors has dissolved the assembly, then the government should be formed by holding assembly elections there within four-five months at the earliest
 lambey samay tak ham nahin chaahate hai ki vahaan par raashtrapati shashan chalata rahe
 Ghulam Nabi Azad admitted that there was going to be a meeting of Congress mlas on November 23, in which we were going to consider the possibility of forming a government because there were such things going on for three to four months that the chances of forming a government were explored
 But, the matter was getting stuck here that in such a situation neither a Congress leader was ready to become the Chief Minister nor the National Conference
 pidipi apana mukhyamantri vahaan chaah rahi thi
 It was not possible to form a government there
 baagi netaa jarur chaah rahe the ki sarkaar bane
 As soon as the BJP came to know that the possibilities of forming a government were being considered, it quickly imposed President's rule
 is bich khabar yah bhi ai ki chunaav ayog is par vichaar kar rahaa he ki vidhansabha bhang hone ke baad pradesh main aachaar samhita lagu ho sakati he yaa nahin
 Thoughts on this have intensified in the Commission

 - ANI (@ANI) November 21, 2018 Earlier, Mehbooba Mufti said in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that our main focus is on 35A and the special status of the state
 iskaa masalaa janvari main uthaa tha
 When i was Chief Minister, i opposed it
 kashmiri avam ne iske liye bahut qurbaani di he
 At that time there were talks of making such changes, which was not in the interest of the people
 mahabuuba ne teenon dalon ke ek saath aane ke bachaav main tark diya ki rajya ke special darje ko bachaae rakhane ke liye hi ham sabhi saath aae hai
 Has the pdp-congress and National Conference come together due to reports of BJP forming government with other parties? On this question, Mehbooba said that after the formation of a big party in the state, the BJP is trying to break the parties which established democratic values after hard work and sacrifices in the princely state
 aisi hi takat kaa saamana karne ke liye hamane ek saath aane kaa faisla liya
 On the question of who among the three parties took the initiative to come together, Mehbooba said that all three of us have come together
 hamaari tarah donon dal bhi 35 e or centre ke rajya ke prati ravaiye ko lekar chintit hai
 On the question of who will lead it among the three parties, Mehbooba said that at present, the PDP is leading it
 lekin abhi ham is par charchaa kar rahe hai
 On whether the NC will also be a part of the government or will it only support from outside, Mehbooba said that a decision is yet to be made on this
 rajyapal ko sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ke sawaal par mahabuuba ne kaha ki ham unhen donon dalon ke samarthan patr ke saath fax kar rahe hai
 He said let us see what happens next
 kya hai vidhansabha ke samikarnajammu-kashmir vidhansabha main kul 89 site hai, jinamein se do sadsy manonith kiye jate hai
 In such a situation, 44 legislators are needed to form a government
 maujuuda sthiti main pipuls democratic party (pidipi) ke paas 28, bijepi ke 25 or neshnal conference ke paas 15 or congress ke paas 12 site hai
 That is, if the PDP, Congress and National Conference come together, the figure is reaching 55 and a government can be formed easily
 (input-sharat kumaar kii report) Amidst the politics of cow running across the country, have you ever wondered what the cow itself must be feeling on this? This question has come up from the agitation in Mumbai on Wednesday

 When the police loaded the agitators into the van, the question came, what to do with the cow? Like the agitators, there was an attempt to take the cow behind the police van
 ek do chakkar kaatane ke baad gaay saham gai
 His calf had been separated from him in this high heat and people were pulling him from the front, pushing him from behind
 tippaniyan The cow brought into the movement was also a challenge for the police
 police bhi gaay ko maukey se dur kar dena chaahati thi
 In the meantime, the cow started non-cooperation due to excesses with herself

 She was not taking the name of moving from there

 kendra sarkaar ke vaarshik bajet main aam aadmi ko intjaar yah jaanane kaa rahata tha ki uske jarurat kii kin chizon par sarkaar ne tex main badlaav kiya he
 That is, what became cheap for the common man after the budget and what was expensive
 lekin 1 july se puure desh main jiesti lagu ho chukaa he or ab kendra sarkaar dwaara shuru kii ja chuki 2018 kii bajet prakriya main aam aadmi kii dilchaspee nahin hogi
 This is because the GST Council is now responsible for fixing taxes on products and services
 jiesti council vitt mantri ke netritv vaali sanstha he jisamen sabhi rajyon ke vitt mantri shaamil hai
 Under the GST Act, after 1 July 2017, the GST Council will be responsible for determining the tax on all products and services in the country
 gauratlab he ki jahaan beete varshon main vaarshik bajet par aam aadmi kii najar sasta-mahangaa jaanane ke liye rahati thi lekin 3 maheene pehle lagu hue jiesti ke baad jiesti council teen baar sasta-mahangaa nirdhaarit kar chuki he
 Therefore, in the upcoming annual budget, only direct tax - ie personal income tax and corporate tax - along with custom duty will be determined by the central government
 ise bhi padhein: aa rahaa 'nayaa jiesti', jaane kar, kar adhikari or kaarobaar se judi 10 khaas batenhaalanki jiesti main praavdhaan ke mutabik vaarshik bajet main jiesti council dwaara nirdhaarit alag-alag utpaadon or sevaaon kaa samavesh dekhne ko milegaa
 Along with this, the annual budget of the central government as well as accounts of new schemes and programs will be present in the annual budget
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle kendra sarkaar ne rail mantralay ke alag bajet kii vyavastha ko vaarshik bajet main samahit kar diya tha
 Due to this decision, in the last budget, the common man did not get to hear the announcement on new trains and new rail routes in the railway budget
 vahiin ek anya cheez jiske liye aam aadmi ko vaarshik bajet kaa intjaar rahata tha vah he kendra sarkaar dwaara nai skiimon or yojanaon kii ghoshnaa kaa
 But during the last three years of the Modi government, this importance of the budget has also been discounted as most of the schemes and schemes of the government have been launched back and forth
 bajet kaa istemaal mahaj in skiimon ke liye fund kaa praavdhaan karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 Significantly, the Central Government has also made major changes in the date of presenting the budget
 pehle jahaan 28 farvari ko aam bajet pesh kiya jaataa tha vahiin pichley varsh is parampara ko khatm kar 1 farvari ko bajet pesh kiya gaya
 Now the central government is preparing to make changes in the financial year
 is badlaav se april-march se vitt varsh ko badalakar janvari-disambar kar diya jayega
 Therefore, to do this, it will be necessary that the central government can start the budget process from August to September and complete it by November
 aise main saaf he ki beete kuch varshon main aam aadmi ke liye vaarshik bajet kaa mahatv kam hua he or aane vaale dinon main vah mahaj sarkari kharch or aamadani kii report se adhik nahin rah jayega
