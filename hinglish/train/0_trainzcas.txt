 Also, the first list of candidates for the upcoming assembly elections in Haryana can also be issued by the Election Committee after this meeting
 kheti-kisaani ke saath vikaas kii daud main jab hukka jagah-jagah gudgudaata dikhe, to samaj jaaie ki aap haryana main hai
 At one time, three Lalas dominated the land of Haryana - Bhajan Lal, Bansi Lal and Devi Lal
 lekin aaj devilal parivaar viraasat kii jang se jujh rahaa he or jind ke upachunaav kaa faisla tay karne vaala he ki devilal kii viraasat kiski hogi
 Actually, Devi Lal had handed over his legacy to Omprakash Chautala, but now Omprakash Chautala's sons Ajay and Abhay have come face to face
 omprakash chautaala ne apni party indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) kii kaman apane bete abhaya chautaala ke supurd kar di to ajay ne nai jananaayak janata party bana lee
 After this, Ajay Chautala's younger son Digvijay also staked his claim on the legacy of Dada Devi Lal, after he became a party with Jind by-election
 cap-plate chunaav chinh lekar vah inelo ke ainak chunaav chinh ke khilaaf maidan main hai
 In Jatland, Digvijay claims that Devi Lal was a man of the age and the public would reply on the right to Jind's legacy
 vaise digvijay chutki lenaa nahin bhoolatey ki chunaav nattejey aaenge to unke dada opi chautaala ko bhi sukun hoga
 While the by-election of Vajjind is a war of inheritance for the Chautala family, there is a big effort for the Congress to return
 varshon se haryana kii satta par kabiz congress pichley chunaav main rajya main teen number kii party ho gai
 After the death of INLD MLA from Jind, BJP made his son Krishna Middha a candidate

 In such a situation, even after searching for the Congress in the by-elections, there was not getting a winning candidate
 khastahal congress party ne aakhirkaar haryana main vaapasi kii aas main jind jile kii kaithal seat se vidhayak, congress ke media vibhaag ke prabharee or rahul gandhi ke kareebi randeep surajevaala ko ummidavaar banaakar mukaable ko rochak bana diya
 Actually, when Jind's masculine came in front of Gandhi, everyone said that there is no strong candidate
 is bich party main lagaataar badhate kad ke chalate surajevaala rajya ke netaaon kii najaron main khatak rahe the
 In such a situation, the rest of the leaders created a vision to make Surjewala a political martyr by making Abhimanyu in the Chakravyuh of Jind, but Surjewala surprised everyone and accepted the challenge in front of Rahul
 iske saath hi party netaaon se pehle ilaake ke bahubali or pehle congress main rahe jepi ko saadhane ke liye rahul gandhi ne ahamed patel kaa sahaara liya or kaamyaab hue
 After meeting Ahmed Patel, JP has forgotten his old feud with Surjewala and has become his helper and is also declaring it openly
 vahiin, arjuna kii tarah kurukshetra jeetne kaa khwab liye surajevaala abhimanyu banaae jane ke sawaal par kehete hai ki, vah bhagwaan se apni tulana to nahin karte, lekin haryana ke kurukshetra main abhimanyu nahin, balki krishna kii bhoomika main hai
 However, Digvijay or bjp's Midda both call Surjewala an outsider
 jis par palatwaar karte hue congressi kehete hai ki janata to surajevaala ko baari ummidavaar maanati he
 When the opposition candidates also say outsiders, the public turns back and tells them heavily
 pita ke prati sahanubhuti lahar ke saath sattarudh bijepi ke ummidavaar doctor krishna midda kehete hai ki khatter sarkaar kii saakh kaa sawaal to tab aata jab koi muqabla hota, yahaan to bijepi kii jeet tay he

 In the rule of Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government, its momentum is maintained along the same lines
 aazaadee ke samay himachal pradesh lagbhag ashikshit rajya tha, par aaj yahaan sakshartaa kaa pratishat kareeb 90 par pahunch chukaa he
 Education Secretary Arun Kumar explains the reason that 100 percent enrollment is taking place at primary school level and about 80 percent at secondary level
 ve kehete hai ki himachal pehla rajya he jahaan sakal namakan anupaat (jiiaar) 54 pratishat darj hua he
 It is clear that Himachal Pradesh is spending generously on education

 79 crores Rs
 kii raashi aavantit kar rahi he jo desh ke anya rajyon ke mukaable sabase zyada he
 The state has also achieved a student-teacher ratio of 11: 1, with a large number of teachers recruited and ensuring their career improvement
 yah bhi akhil bharat str par sabase acha he
 Another qualitative trend is also emerging — 45 percent of the children enrolled in educational institutions are girls
 arun kumaar kehete hai ki jaise hi primary skool ke daakhile main choti-si giravat darj hui, vaise hi samaadhaan ke taur par 3,300 sarkari skulon main turant hi priskool suvidhaayen shuru kar di gai thim
 In order to set the standards of syllabus, the Thakur government has decided to include NCERT books in schools

 ''is silsile main apanaaya gaya ek or tarika bhi behad safal rahaa jiske tahat skulon main shiksha or gyaan ke str kaa vaastavik samay ke sandarbh main moolyankan karne ke liye samay-samay par rajyastareey surveykshan (esalees) kiye ja rahe hai
 Other states are also following this trend
 arun kumaar kehete hai, "bacchon kii andruni khushi'' ko badhaane ke liye shiksha vibhaag bacchon ko saamudayik kaaryakramon main bhaag lene or yoga karne ke liye protsaahit kar rahaa he or usne "skool bag mukt'' dinon kii yojana bhi pesh kii he
 Bollywood actor Amjad Khan is known as the successful villain of the industry
 iske alaava baaki saporting rolls main bhi unhone shandaar kaam kiya
 Apart from the film world, he was also a brilliant man in real life
 ve kairactor ke bahut strong the or kala se behad pyaar karte the
 Amjad Khan's friendship with Big b was very deep
 sholay ke set par donon ne acchhee bonding share kii thi
 While sharing an anecdote during this time, Amitabh had told that Amjad Khan was very fond of tea
 amitabh bachchan, amjad khan ko bahut kareeb se jaanate the
 Amitabh had said that Amjadchay was very fond of him
 aap ginati nahin kar sakate ki vah shoot ke dauraan kitni chaay pi jaaya karte the
 One of his tea and another was his joke, these two things had a special place in his life
 iske alaava kuch reports main to ye kissa bhi mashhoor he ki ek baar set par doodh khatm ho gaya tha
 So the next day Amjad Khan brought a buffalo near the canteen
 kaha jaataa he ki ve din main 20 se zyada chaay pi jaaya karte the
 Amjad Khan and Amitabh Bachchan Bachchan did many films together in these films
 donon kii hero villen vaali onscreen chemistry ko khub saraahaa gaya
 Amitabh himself had revealed that when he scripted 'sholay', he told the director that he wanted to play Gabbar
 lekin ramesh sippi ne unhen jai ke kirdaar ke liye chunaa
 Amitabh and Amjad Khan worked in many films apart from 'sholay', including many films like 'mahan', 'atheist', 'satte Pe Satta', 'yarana'
 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) apane moon mishan chandrayan-2 ko 14 or 15 july kii darmyaani raat 2
 Will launch at 51
 lonching sriharikota ke satish dhawan centre ke duusare launch pad se hogi
 It will be launched with India's most powerful GSLV mark-iii rocket
 launch ke safal hone ke baad kareeb 55 din main 6 or 7 sitambar ko chand kii sataha par utrega
 Chandrayaan-2 lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan will land at the South Pole
 vahiin, orbitor chandramaa ke chaaron taraf chakkar lagaate hue vikram or pragyan se mili data ke prithvi par sthit isro centre ke bhejega
 The cost of this project is 1000 crores
 agar mishan safal hua to america, rus, china ke baad bharat chand par rover utaarne vaala chauthaa desh hoga
 It is important for us to know that Chandrayaan-2, why and how important these missions are
 
 
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahisaro kaa moon mishan chandrayan-2
 Why Chandrayaan-2 mission is important for ISRO, five big reasons 1
 vaigyanik kshamta dikhaanaa - jab rus ne manaa kiya to ISRO vaigyanikon ne khud banaaya lander-rovernovember 2007 main roosi antariksh agency roscosmos ne kaha tha ki vah is project main saath kaam karegaa
 He will give Lander to ISRO
 2008 main is mishan ko sarkaar se anumati mili
 The design of Chandrayaan-2 was completed in 2009
 janvari 2013 main lonching tay thi, lekin roosi antariksh agency roscosmos lander nahin de pai
 ISRO fixed the launch of Chandrayaan-2 in March 2018
 lekin kuch test ke liye lonching ko april 2018 or phir oktober 2018 tak taala gaya
 Meanwhile, in June 2018, ISRO decided that Chandrayaan-2 will be launched in January 2019 by making some changes
 phir launch date badhaakar farvari 2019 kiya gaya
 The launch news was also reported in April 2019
 is mishan kii safalataa se yah saaf ho jayega ki hamaare vaigyanik kisi ke mohataaj nahin hai
 They can complete any mission
 ISRO ne hamen kya diya? jaaniye
 
 
 What do we benefit from satellite 2
 isro kaa chota sa kadam, bharat kii chhavi banane kii lambii chalaantpane duusare moon mishan chandrayan-2 ke saath ISRO antariksh vigyaan kii duniya main ho saktaa he ki chota kadam rakh rahaa ho, lekin yah bharat kii chhavi banane ke liye ek lambii chalaang sabit ho sakati he
 Because so far only five countries of the world have been able to get a soft landing on the moon
 ye desh hai - america, rus, europe, china or japan
 After this, India will be the sixth country to do so
 haalanki, rover utaarne ke maamle main chauthaa desh he
 After Chandrayaan, Sun, Mars, Venus turn, Indian astronauts will go into space 3
 kathin jagah kaa chunaavah chand par jagah vah chuni, jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa heisro ke anusaar chandrayan 2 bhartiya moon mishan he jo puri himmat se chaand ke dakshini dhruv kshetra main utrega jahaan abhi tak koi desh nahin pahunchaa he – yani ki chandramaa kaa dakshini dhruviya kshetra
 Its purpose is to collect information about the moon
 aisi khoj karnaa jinase bharat ke saath hi puri maanavtaa ko phayda hoga
 On the basis of these tests and experiences, necessary major changes will be made in the preparation of future lunar missions
 taaki aane vaale daur ke chandra abhiyaanon main apanaai jane vaali nai technology ko banane or unhen tay karne main madad mili

 sabase taqatvar rocket GSLV mk-iii kaa upyog ho rahaa he chandrayan-2 mishan menkeghshwa mk-iii bharat kaa ab tak kaa sabase shaktishaalee launture he
 It has been made entirely in the country
 teen stage kaa yah rocket 4 hajaar kilo ke upgrah ko 35,786 kimi se lekar 42,164 kimi kii oonchai par sthit jeeosincronas orbit main pahunchaa saktaa he
 Alternatively, a satellite of 10 thousand kg can reach 160 to 2000 km of Low Earth Orbit
 is rocket ke jariye 5 june 2017 ko jiset-19 or 14 november 2018 ko jiset-29 kaa safal prakshepan kiya ja chukaa he
 It is also expected that isro's manned mission Gaganyaan will be dispatched from the state-of-the-art avatar of this rocket
 antariksh main bharat sabase aage, china kaa mangal mishan fail, pakistan to res main hi nahin5
 What will isro's Chandrayaan-2 find on the moon, which will surprise the world, and check whether the earthquake on the moon will occur at the same place where the land of Vikram Dekandrayan-2 will land
 vahaan thermal or lunar dencity kitni he
 The rover will chemically examine the lunar surface
 taapmaana or vaataavaran main aadrata (humidity) he ki nahin
 The evidence of water on the lunar surface was discovered by Chandrayaan 1, but from Chandrayaan 2 it can be found that how much of the lunar surface and the subsurface has water

 Two girls, both murdered
 or donon bani paheli
 Because in one where the girl's face was lost, in the other case the girl was taken straight to the grave
 in donon paheliyon main sabase pehle baat mayanagari mumbai ke us rahasyamayi katl kii, jisamen maut ke saath hi ladki kii pahchaan gum ho chuki thi
 At 3 am on 23 September 2013, the phone bell rang at Bandra Police Station
 phone uthaate hi duusari taraf se jo khabar mili wo police kii neend udne ke liye kaaphi thi
 The caller had reported to the police that someone's body was found lying in a bundle of clothes in the bushes near Bandra sea-link
 khabar milte hi police team fouran ravaanaa ho jaati he
 There was still movement of vehicles on c-link
 maukey par pahunchate sachmuch ek gathree padi thi
 As soon as the police opened the bundle there was a dead body inside
 ek ladki kii laash
 But surprisingly the corpse's head and torso were missing
 par jism ke aadhe-adhure hisse ko dekhakar ye pataa chal gaya tha ki laash ladki kii he
 Now the body was in front of the police, but incomplete
 laash ladki kii he ye to pataa tha
 But do not know who the girl is
 aasapaas aisi koi cheez bhi nahin thi jo ladki kii shinaakht kaa pataa de sakati
 Missing face and no such thing
 haa, jis kapade main laash ko lapet kar jhaadiyon main phenkaa gaya, us kapade se itnaa jarur pataa chal rahaa tha ki marane vaali kisi achche ghar se he
 Because the fabric looked very precious
 shuruaati tafteesh se saaf ho jaataa he ki katl behad berahami se kiya gaya he
 The disappearance of the head and torso meant that the murderer did not want Maktool to be identified
 phir bhi kisi saboot kii talash main police ne aas-paas kii tamaam jhaadiyon ko chaan diya, par koi saboot haath nahin laga
 The police sent the corpse for postmortem
 iske baad jaanch shuru hui
 First of all, it is tried to find out from Bandra and nearby police stations that there is no case of missing or kidnapping of a girl in any police station
 par kamyaabi haath nahin lagati
 Some other pieces of corpse have been found somewhere else, there is no such news from anywhere
 yani murder kaa ye cese puri tarah blind he
 The murderer disappeared and the corpse without a face
 ab aise main police kya karegi? kaise sulajhaayegi cese ko?mumbai kaa bandra-varli si link samandar ke upar bana wo pul he, jisase hokar har rose takreeban 40 hazaar gaadiyaan guzarati hai
 But from this same sea link, the dead body of a girl found just thirty meters away from Mumbai police has created a new challenge for her
 ek ahm sawaal ye he ki qaatil ne aakhir itani bheedbhad vaali jagah par laash ke hisse ko nipataane kii koshish kyon kii? wo bhi tab, jab yahaan naa sirf choubison ghante haivi trekkic rahata he, balki raat ke vakt bhi raushnee hoti he
 a large area of c-link is also covered by CCTV cameras
 jaahir he police ko is baat kaa bhi shaq he ki ladki yaa kaatil kaa rishta bandra yaa varli ke kisi ilaake se bhi ho saktaa he
 Because this is the area around the c-link where people live
 or aam taur par koi bhi qaatil kisi laash yaa unke tukdon ko lekar bahut dur tak jane kii jokhim nahin uthaata
 It is evident that the police is now investigating the footage of CCTV cameras on every path coming and going towards the reclamation in c-link, so that there is no trace of any suspicious vehicle stopping or any other movement at that place
 lekin isse pehle ki police ko is maamle main koi kamyaabi mili, mumbai police puri mumbai or aas-paas se gaayab hui kisi aisi kisi ladki kaa pataa lagaana chaahati he
 Because the first and only condition before the police to solve this blind murder case is to identify the dying girl
 haalanki philhal police adhakati laash kaa postmortem karwaane ke saath-saath uske kuch hisse diene jaanch ke liye bhi rakhwana chaahati he, taaki marane vaali kii pahchaan kaa koi daawa saamne aane par uske gharavaalon ke saath diene kaa milan kar isaki tasdik kii ja sake
 Overall, this case of blind murder of a girl is as dangerous as it is at the moment
 ab baat banaras kii ladki keebanaras main ek ladki kii maut hui or use dafna bhi diya gaya
 But 16 days after his death, his family came to know of a question related to this death, which only his daughter could answer
 lihaaza, gharavaalon ne kabr main dafn apni beti se hi is sawaal kaa jawaab poochne kaa faisla kiya
 The body of a 17-year-old girl was taken out of the grave
 uski maut ab se kareeb 16 din pehle yani 7 sitambar ko hui thi
 In fact, this morning, the girl's family members were shocked when they saw their girl in a dead condition outside the house
 pehali nazar main dekhakar ye lag rahaa tha ki ladki kii maut oonchai se girane kii vajah se hui he
 Therefore, the people accepted this fate as a game of fate and not only accepted the incident, but the dead body was also cremated on the same day
 lekin abhi chand roj guzare hi the ki khud ladki kii maa taslim ko apni beti kii maut ke bare main ek aisi baat pataa chali, jisane use baichaiyn kar diya
 This was the case of murder
 taslim ko khabar mili ki uski beti maut kisi haadase kii vajah se nahin, balki sochi samajhi sajeesh kii vajah se hui
 The dead body had come out of the grave
 or gharavaalon ko lagane laga tha ki unki beti apane kaatil kaa naam jarur bataaegi
 But since the case was of murder, the answer to every question was to be asked by the police
 ab sawaal police ke the or jawaab maranevaali ladki ke
 There were many questions, which the girl's mother came to the conclusion in seeking answers, she raised the ears of not only this mother, but the whole family
 gharavaalon ko pataa chalaa ki unki beti bagal ke hi ek ladke se pyaar karti thi or vaardaat ke roj raat ko usee ladke ne mobile par phone kar use apane paas bulaayaa tha
 But before she returned home, she died in mysterious condition by falling from above
 ab gharavaalon ko lagane laga ki kahin aisa to nahin ki bagal ke ladke ne hi unki beti ke saath koi zyaadati karne ke baad use chup karaane ke liye use upar se giraakar uski jaan le lee? lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhane ke liye laash kaa postmortem zaruri tha
 While on the day of the incident, they buried the daughter's body in a hurry
 lihaaza, jab ladki maa or uske gharavaalon ko apni galati kaa ahsaas hua, unhone police se shikaayat kii or tab magistrate kii maujuudagi main laash ko kabr se nikaalkar is maamle kii tafteesh karne kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 Now the corpse has been taken out of the grave
 bas, intazaar he to postmortem report kaa
 So that it can be clear that this death is really a murder or just an accident

 chunki yah mahina sant hone or naitik hone kaa he isliye puraani baat yaad dilaa di
 One good effect of demonetisation is that the credibility of political parties has also come into the public eye
 raajnneetik dalon kii vittiya vyavastha kaise paardarshee ho
 The debate has been going on for many years, but after many years the debate dies down
 notebandi or cashles kii tarah chande ko lekar ratorat faisle kaa elaan kyon nahin ho saktaa he
 If there is some deficiency, then new rules will be made
 chandon ke maamle main kisi raajnneetik dal kaa record acha nahin he
 Go to the website of the Association for Democratic Reform ADR, an organization that constantly researches and makes people aware of this topic
 unke shodh ke aadhaar par di vir main vaishali ravat or hemanth singh ne ek lekh likhaa he
 The ADR has studied the calculation of donations from six national parties between 2004 and 2012
 kisi ne nahin bataaya ki 75 fisadi chanda kahaan se aayaa he
 You know that parties have to give details only after the donation of more than 20,000, but ADR says that in this case also political parties do not give correct information about PAN number to check number
 apane chande kaa 80 fisadi hissaa 20,000 kii rakam se neeche dikhaa dete hai taaki detail na bataanaa pade
 According to the ADR, there is no provision for punishment or strict punishment against political parties for not providing a correct report
 jabaki aap agar iskar ritern main jaankaree galat de den to mushkil main pad sakate hai
 The Election Commission should tell whether political parties account for item wise expenditure or lump sum
 agar item waayiz hisaab dete hai to kya unke paas reliyon ke kharche ko lekar die gaye aankadon kaa koi byora he
 There is a description of the helicopter to know how much our leaders spend
 ek hi helicopter kitne paise main bijepi ke netaa ko le jaataa he or kitne paise main congress ke netaa ko
 Did the congress-bjp think when a law was changed this year to make a way for itself to get donations from foreign companies
 jabaki dilli hoicourt ne bijepi or congress ko landan sthit company vedanta se chanda lene ke maamle main doshi mana tha or karrwai kaa aadesh diya tha
 Do you know that six national political parties do not file IT returns on time
 is maamle main ediaar kii research kahati he ki bijepi, congress, ensipi sab doshi hai
 When the return of the general public is scrutinized, then under which law is the scrutiny of the returns of political parties
 2012-13 or 2014-15 main bijepi ne bataaya hi nahin ki chanda kaise-kaise mila
 Congress did not provide a PAN number in 2013-14
 is vakt har dal chande ko lekar bahes kii baat kar rahaa he
 One issue has been that there should be a state fund for election expenses
 kisi ne ise neshnal fund kaha he to kisi ne ise public fund kaha he
 The idea of the State Fund is good
 lekin ise lekar kai sawaal abhi puche jane chahie
 How much will the national party get from the state fund, how much will the regional party get, how much will the new party get
 kya sabko baraabar milegaa yaa alag-alag milegaa
 Many candidates have cases of assets worth six to six hundred crores, why should their expenses be raised from public funds
 garib ummidavaar kaa kharchaa sarkaar uthaae yah baat to samaj aati he lekin kisi ummidavaar kii haisiyat hajaar karod kii he to uskaa chunavi kharchaa bharat kii garib janata kyon uthaae
 According to one figure, 449 mps out of 543 in the current Lok Sabha have assets of one crore or more
 jis party ke sabase adhik karodpati ummidavaar hon kyon na use kam chanda diya jaae
 This will give the poor a chance to come forward in politics
 aapke ankar ko lagata he ki yah idia janata ke paise se amir or shahi gharaanon ke ummidavaaron ko madad karnaa he
 It is another matter that your anchor is not special
 isaki kya guarantee he ki state fund se bijness gharaanon par raajnneetik dalon kii nirbharta kam ho jaaegi
 There is a plea that the idea of the State Fund cannot be successful until politics is eradicated from criminalization
 kyon public ke paise se kisi bahubali yaa mafia ke chunaav ko fund kiya janaa chahie
 There is a limit on the expenses of the candidates
 tamaam nakebandiyon ke baad bhi ayog jaanata he or maanata he ki bahut se ummidavaar seemaa se zyada kharchaa karte hai
 When the same could not apply, what are we going to get from the State Fund? tippaniyan There is a report by Indian Express
 21 april 2014 ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye upi ke hardoi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 There he made a vow about mps with criminal cases
 agar uski yaad dilaai jaae or ve pahal kar den to 2019 se pehle aapraadhik aaropon vaale kai saansadon kii loksabhaa se vidaai ho sakati he
 Many mps may also be free of charges
 piem ne ek naaraa diya tha
 Free Parliament from the criminals ediaar ke aankadon ke anusaar bijepi ke 98 saansadon ne apane halafname main aapraadhik maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 Of the 18 Sena mps, 15 have referred criminal cases
 congress ke 44 main se 8 saansad aise hai
 Reminded the old thing since it is a month of being a saint and being moral
 notebandi kaa ek acha asar to he ki raajnneetik dalon kii saakh bhi public kii nigaah main aa gai he

 The PM gave a slogan

 According to ADR data, 98 BJP mps have mentioned criminal cases in their affidavits
 shivasena ke 18 saansadon main se 15 ne aapraadhik maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 8 out of 44 Congress mps are like this

 One good effect of demonetisation is that the credibility of political parties has also come into the public eye
 kya congress-bijepi ne tab sochaa tha jab is saal ek kanoon main badlaav kar apane liye videshi companiyon se chanda lene kii chhot kaa rasta bana liya
 While the Delhi High Court held the BJP and Congress guilty in the case of taking donations from London-based company Vedanta and ordered action
 kya aapako pataa he ki chah rashtriya raajnneetik dal samay par iti ritern nahin bharte hai
 Research by ADR in this case says that BJP, Congress, NCP are all guilty
 jab aam janata ke ritern kii scrootni hoti he to raajnneetik dalon ke ritern kii scrootni kis kanoon ke tahat manaa he
 In 2012-13 and 2014-15, the BJP did not even tell how the donations were received
 congress ne 2013-14 main pan number hi nahin bataaya
 Right now every party is talking about the debate on donations
 ek masalaa chalaa he ki chunaav ke kharche ke liye state fund ho
 Some have called it a national fund and some have called it a public fund
 state fund kaa idia acha he
 But many questions should be asked about it now
 state fund se neshnal party ko kitna milegaa, kshetreey party ko kitna milegaa, nai party ko kitna milegaa

 is vakt har dal chande ko lekar bahes kii baat kar rahaa he
 One issue has been that there should be a state fund for election expenses
 kisi ne ise neshnal fund kaha he to kisi ne ise public fund kaha he
 The idea of the State Fund is good
 lekin ise lekar kai sawaal abhi puche jane chahie
 How much will the national party get from the state fund, how much will the regional party get, how much will the new party get
 kya sabko baraabar milegaa yaa alag-alag milegaa
 Many candidates have cases of assets worth six to six hundred crores, why should their expenses be raised from public funds

 arvind kejariwal ne iares seva se apane istipha sambandhi masale ke samaadhaan ke liye nau lakh se adhik rupye kii raashi sarkaar ko saunp di
 Along with this, he said that he is doing this as a protest and it does not mean that he has admitted any mistake

 These people have lent this amount to Kejriwal
 43 varshiya kejariwal ke is kadam ko team anna par ho rahe hamalon ke jawaab ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 It is to be noted that on behalf of the government, it was said that Kejriwal had violated the contract rules by leaving the service and going on study leave on full pay before completing three years in IRS (indian Revenue Service)
 haalanki kejariwal kaa kahana he ki unhone gaiyr-vaitanaik avkaash liya or anubandh kii sharton ko puraa karne ke baad seva chodi
 He said in a four-page letter to the Prime Minister, "I am sending a check of nine lakh 27 thousand 787 with the letter
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki maine galati maani he
 When i do not know what mistake i have made, there is no question of accepting it
 ’kejariwal ne likhaa, ‘main is raashi ko virodh ke taur par lautaa rahaa hum
 i appeal to you to instruct the Home Minister to accept my resignation
 meraa istipha manjuur ho jane ke baad mere paas is raashi ko waapas lene ke liye adaalat jane kaa adhikaar hoga
 Kejriwal claimed that he did not have any savings and he took a loan from six of his friends for repayment
 unhone kaha ki kai logon ne unhen paise dene kii peshkash kii lekin unhone ise nahin liya kyonki iskaa aashay bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kaa durupyog hona nikaala ja saktaa tha
 He said, 'so i took a loan from people i have known for many years
 puri sarkari mashinari team anna ke peeche padi he
 i request you with folded hands that your government should not disturb those who have given me a loan
 ’ kejariwal ne rajasav seva ke dauraan ek november, 2000 ko do saal ke liye puure vetan par adhyayan avkaash liya tha
 He signed a bond according to which he would have to return the full salary if he resigned or retired within three years of his study leave or did not return to service
 kejariwal ek november 2002 ko phir se daftar main pahunche lekin 18 maheene baad bina vetan ke chuttee lee
 The government says that taking leave after 18 months was a violation of the terms of the bond
 kejariwal ne is daleel kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki unhone band ke kisi praavdhaan ko nahin todaa or adhyayan avkaash ke baad phir se seva par lautne ke teen saal ke baad naukari se istipha diya
 The Chief Income Tax Commissioner's office had issued a notice to Kejriwal on August 5 and 9
 27 lakh rupee kaa bhugtan karne ko kaha
 On which Kejriwal and other members of Anna Paksha called it an action of the government department on the instructions of political masters
 kejariwal ne apane patr main daawa kiya ki unhone kisi niyam kaa ulanghan nahin kiya
 He said, 'but your government is asking me to return the salary including interest which i took during my study leave
 ’ unhone daleel di, ‘aapaki sarkaar mujhase puch rahi he ki bina vetan ke do saal kii chhuttiyon main maine kya kiya
 It was during this period that i drafted RTI

 He said, 'I want to ask you what crime i committed while working for RTI during holidays without pay which i should not have done
 main aapse anurodh karata hum ki kripaya mujhe bataaen maine kya galat kiya
 Kejriwal said that he has been trying to tell the government for the last five years that he has done nothing wrong
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe bataaya gaya he ki is baar pradhanmantri karyaalay ne bhi meri file dekhi he or unhen bhi main galat lagata hum
 i do not understand what crime i have been punished for
 kya koi mujhe bataa saktaa he ki maine kya galat kiya, taaki main bhavishya main nahin karu
 Kejriwal said that he had taken a two-year study leave promising that he would gather information to tackle corruption in the electricity and PDS sector
 unhone kaha, ‘kaam par lautne ke baad mujhe ek saal se adhik samay tak koi jimmedaari nahin di gayi
 i was taking salary without work
 mujhe yah galat laga
 i did not have a holiday
 isliye maine bina vetan ke chuttee lene kaa faisla kiya
 My leave was also approved

 Every day the increasing pollution in delhi-ncr is causing problems for the residents from here to the tourists visiting Delhi
 lekin aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki yahi pradooshan bhayanak garmi main bhi dilli ke badhate tapamam ko 2 se 3 degree kam rakhane main madad kar rahaa he
 Recent research has revealed that the temperature in Delhi is lower than other neighboring cities due to nothing but the increasing pollution of Delhi
 vaigyanikon ne is prakriya ko 'urban kooling iffect' kaa naam diya he jisko saal main do baar mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 First in summer in the months of May and June and secondly in winter in the months of October to December
 dilli ke mukaable duusare shaharon main in maheenon main thik iske ulat hota he jise vaigyanikon ne 'urban hit island' kaa naam diya he jisamen garmi ke vaataavaran main trep ho jane ke kaaran taapmaana zyada ho jaataa he
 The amount of pollutants called aerosols in Delhi's pollution increases during the scorching summer and winter seasons
 vaigyanikon kii maane to isi pradooshak ke chalate dilli kaa taapmaana kam ho jaataa he
 In fact, some categories of aerosol pollutants absorb the sun's strong rays while some reflect the rays
 isse tej kirane dilli tak nahin pahunch paati
 According to research, the amount of aerosol is more in the atmosphere during the daytime, so Delhi is colder than other states during the daytime, while at night the temperature of Delhi is higher than other cities
 paryaavaranvid vimalendu kaa kahana he, 'arosol behad sookshya kan hote hai or dhul, samudri namak, ret, sulphate, nitrate, mineral dust or vaataavaran kii nami main bhi maujuud hote he

 ' haalanki paryaavaran vid kii maane to ye hamaare liye khushi kii nahin balki chintajanak baat he
 Let me tell you that this research was also done by IIT Mumbai
 iske alaava jeenyu, neshnal physical, central uniwarsity of punjab, tejpur uniwarsity or indian institute of remote sencing ne sanyukt rup se kii he
 This includes data from March 2000 to November 2011
 ab isse is baat kaa andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 2011 se ab tak dilli kaa pradooshan str kitna bad gaya hoga

 Meanwhile, Vasundhara Raje has made it clear that she is not going to talk about the issue of resignation
 aazaadee ke 68 saal ke baad, aaj hamaara desh har kshetra main lagaataar growth kar rahaa he
 Be it education or science or economy
 lekin khel ke maidan main hamaari naav dagamagaati hi rahi he, olympic ho yaa kaamanwealth hamaari medals teli bahut prashansaneey nahin rahi he
 We are going to host the FIFA Under 17 World Cup but our football team has a ranking of 147
 jis hockey ke ham sartaaj hua karte the aaj vahaan bhi ham 9 number par khisak gaye hai
 Let us know what are the ways to improve this situation
 1- khel se raajnneeti ko hataanabharat main har khel organijeshan main mahatvapurn padon par political leaders baithe hue hai jinaki khel kii samaj bilkul jiro he
 By simply filling their pockets, they mean they are not particularly interested in providing any facility to the players
 agar in organijeshns main rajanetaaon kii jagah purv khilaadiyon ko rakhen to har khel kii sthiti main sudhaar hoga
 Because the mentality and needs of a player can be better understood only by those who have gone through or are fond of that period
 2- ground level se training kii vyavasthachahe china ho, australia ho yaa america in sabhi deshon main ground level se bacchon ko training di jaati he
 Proper academies have been formed there
 lekin hamaare desh main talented khilaadiyon ko naa sahi training milti he naa hi apane yahaan dhang kii acedemies hai
 If special academies are built in every corner of the country, where proper training is given to children from the ground level, then the situation will definitely improve
 sambhavat: skulon main aisi vyavasthaaen uplabdh karai jaaen jisase bachche khel ko kariyar ke rup main lene kii sochen
 3- Better use of technology
 Now the interference of technology has increased in every sport
 cricket, footbal, hockey har khel main aaj zarurat aisi koching kii he jisamen takanic kaa behatar prayog ho
 Technology related to every sport should be made available to our players and coaches
 europea deshon main technical training par bahut zyada pressure diya jaataa he
 Due to which the country is the champion in every sport today
 iske saath hi kushti, footbal, hockey, boxing jaise khelon ke liye uchit turf kii bhi vyavastha honi chahie
 4 - Use of sports budget in the name of sports budget, the money that the government gives every year, along with building a youth academy and putting it in place to find and hide the talent hidden from different corners of the country, will definitely improve our situation
 bharat sarkaar ko khel bajet main bhi badhotaree kerani chahie kyonki behtareen khilaadiyon ke nirmaan ke liye jin suvidhaon kii zarurat he
 They need more money to get them
 khilaadiyon ko protsaahit karne ke liye unhen behatar suvidhaayen deni hi hongi
 Young players of the country should get a chance to play with better foreign players so that they can improve their game more
 5- passport sambandhi niyamon main dheelavideshi passport dhari bhartiya mul ke khilaadiyon ko bharat kii taraf se khilne kaa mauka nahin miltaa he
 While this is not the case in other countries, our rules should be amended by following their steps
 isse har khel main un achche khilaadiyon ko bharat kii taraf se khilne kaa mauka milegaa jo hamen bahut kuch jeetne main madad kar sakate hai par, niyamon ke kaaran ab tak kar nahin pate hai
 To allow hunting of wild boar and nilgai in forest areas in Madhya Pradesh, the issue of amendment of rules has been catching up and former Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has demanded the removal of State Forest Minister Sartaj Singh from the cabinet
 pradesh main fasalon ko nasht kiye jane ko lekar nil gaay tathaa junglee suar ke shikaar ke liye niyamon main sanshodhan kaa prastaav van vibhaag ne sarkaar ke paas bheja he
 Former union minister and Maneka Gandhi, who works for the rights of animals, has strongly opposed the decision of the state government and demanded the immediate removal of the forest minister from the cabinet
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki ve is maamle ko bhaajapa alaakaman ke saamne bhi uthaayengi
 Maneka Gandhi believes that this decision has not been taken by the state government in the interest of farmers, rather the private forest lodge operators will benefit from this decision whose customers are spread in the Middle East and other countries
 unhone kaha ki van mantri dwaara inhen tour operataron ke dabaav main yah faisla kiya gaya he
 Maneka Gandhi said that the number of wildlife in the country is already decreasing and their number will decrease further due to this decision of the MP government
 unhone kaha ki unhone apane jivan main kabhi junglee suar ko nahin dekha he or aise main yah kahkar unke shikaar kii anumati diye jane kaa koi auchity nahin he ki unki sankhya main vruddhi ho rahi he or ve fasal nasht karne ke doshi hai
 He said that when a hunter is allowed to go into the forest for hunting, peace will not be disturbed between the sounds of bullets of other animals living in the forest and whether other animals will be safe
 madhyapradesh sarkaar ke is faisle se naaraaz menka gandhi ne yah sawaal bhi uthaaya ki van main rahane vaale jaanavar kya shikariyon kii kaarywahi se gaanv evam shahari kshetron kii ore rukh nahin karne lagenge tathaa is baat kii kya guarantee he ki nil gaay or junglee suaron ke shikaar ke dauraan galati se kisi hathi yaa anya jaanavar kii goli lagane se mrityu nahin hogi
 Meanwhile, Forest Minister Sartaj Singh says that there is no restriction on hunting of these animals in Madhya Pradesh for the last 12 years, but due to strict rules and provisions, people are unable to hunt these animals, much of the crop of farmers is destroyed
 van mantri ne kaha ki hamane is sambandh main kanoon mantralay ko junglee suar or nil gaay ke shikaar ke niyamon ke sarleekaran kaa prastaav bheja he or yadi prastaav ko anumati mil jaati he to hi us par amal kiya jaayegaa
 He said that the farmers and public representatives of the state had raised the issue of loss of crops by these animals and demanded the government to take steps in this regard

 bharat ke sabase prasiddh dharmaguru, 84 varshiyashri satya sai babaandhra pradesh ke puttaparthi main gambhir beemaari ke baad swasthya laabh kar rahe hai, lekin unki viraasat ke hastantaran kii ruparekha pehle hi taiyaar ho chuki he
 The spiritual guru will make the decision to run his vast empire only after he steps down from the post of Chairman of the all-india-supreme Sathya Sai Central Trust (SSSCT), established in 1972
 yah trust kalyankari ikaayiyon ke,jinamein shaikshik or swasthya sambandhi suvidhaayen shaamil hai, sanchaalan kaa kaam dekhtaa he or tej tarraar auditoron kii team kii sahaayta se kai treston ke hisaab kitaab par bhi niyantran rakhata he
 But when it comes to the immense wealth of Sathya Sai Baba's network, SSSCT keeps its mouth shut
 mana jaataa he ki baba kii kul sampatti kareeb 40,000 karod ru
 , Which includes their movable and immovable property in 165 countries other than India
 unka zyaadaatar paisa skulon, collejon, aspataalon or duusari swasthya suvidhaon main laga hua he
 In addition to his 60 lakh active devotees, donations from 3 crore 10 lakh ordinary devotees continue to add to the trusts' already abundant treasures
 esaxssiti ko die jane vaale chande ko iskar se chhot milti he
 Apart from this, money also comes from the exchange between their influential devotees
 baba kaa network unhen kaarobaari saude karaane main madadgaar sabit hota he
 And in return they donate to Sai Baba's programs
 esaxssiti khud ko gopneeyata ke choge main rakhte hue apni apaar daulat kaa vivaran dene se manaa karata rahaa he
 Its impact is so great that apart from all the influential personalities, even the President and Prime Minister have to ignore the protocol during Sathya Sai Baba's darshan
 paardarshita ke abhaav ke kaaran ne hi shaayad unki daulat ke samrajya ke sahi aakaar ke bare main atakalon ko badhaayaa he or paison ke durupyog ko lekar ashankaayen kii jaati rahi hai
 But SSSCT has made a system of keeping the book of accounts of the money received from its devotees very carefully for the work of Paramarth
 is mushkil kaam kaa shrey mukhya rup se do logon ko jaataa he
 One of them is the secretary of SSSCT
 chakravarti, jo anantpur jile (puttaparthi jiskaa ek hissaa he) ke colector rah chuke hai
 He resigned from his job of IAS for the works of Sathya Sai Baba
 unhone 1981 main satya sai institute of hair larning ke register ke taur par shuruyaat kii thi
 Apart from him, the other person is S

 Mountain
 ve bhi andhra pradesh kader ke iees adhikari rah chuke hai
 He resigned as the Chief Vigilance Commissioner in 1998
 sarkari naukari chhodkar ve shri satya sai vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati ban gaye or unhone shaikshik sansthaanon kaa ek network banaaya
 Both of these vested the entire activities under one large NGO
 esaxssiti puttaparthi main satya sai vishvavidhyalay parisar, 220 bistaron vaala shri satya sai institute of hair medical sciense
 j (where Baba was taken for immediate treatment after becoming ill), Chaitanya Jyoti, a world religion museum, a planetarium, a railway station, a stadium built close to the hill, a music college, an administrative building, an airport
 And runs an indoor stadium
 iske alaava yah trust bangaloru main ek saadhaaran or ek vishesh suvidhaon vaala aspataal, kuch anya aspataal (jinamein do netra aspataal bhi shaamil hai) or kuch upachaar kendron kaa network chalaata he
 It has funded several drinking water projects in addition to a water project for 731 villages in Anantapur district and has helped in repairing the banks of the Kandaleroopundi canal to bring the Krishna river water to Chennai
 vaise to puttaparthi main prashanth nilayam satya sai baba kaa mukhyalay he, lekin garmiyon main ve bangaloru ke bahari ilaake white field main vrundavan or kodaikanal main sai shruti ashram jate hai
 In addition, there are about 1,300 Sathya Sai Baba centers worldwide which run schools, health and cultural centers
 satya sai baba ke aducare kaarykram ne 33 deshon main skool khole hai
 He also has a digital radio network - Radio Sai Global Harmony
 satya sai network baba ke upadeshon ko prachaarit karne ke liye unki viraasat ke taur par apane in sabhi kendron kaa istemaal karegaa

 anjaneyulu ke alaava bade bade netaa or naukarshah shaamil hai, kii sahaayta se in sabhi gatividhiyon ko sansthagat rup de diya he
 Keeping the future in mind, Baba has stopped every effort of his relatives to claim the trust as a family legacy
 unke kareeb 200 sambandhi hai jinhone puttaparthi main restaraan or loj khol rakhe hai yaa phir unke prabhaav ke bal par peshewar ban gaye hai
 Only one of them relatives was active in the trust and that was his brother R

 Janakiram, who died in 2005
 isse khiz kar satya sai baba ke kuch rishtedaar naastik banakar baba ke kalyankari kaaryon ko khaarij karne lage or baba ke bahuprachaarit chamatkaaron ko jhuthalane lage
 Janakiram's son R

 Ratnakar was made a member of SSSCT last year, but has not been given any kind of strength in his hand
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki baba ke jane ke baad unke parivaar ke kuch sadsy sansthaaon kii vifaltaa ko benakaab karne kii koshish karenge
 SSSCT does not have strong defenses in this regard
 shaayad use prabandhan main peedigat badlaav ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Differences may emerge but it is expected that they will be resolved as all concerned feel that the Andhra Pradesh government will take over by taking recourse to the Hindu Religion and Charitable Fund Act of 1959
 satya sai baba ke bhakton main unke prati andhvishwaas or bhakthi kii bhaavana gahare paithi hoti he
 It has become so deep in the last seven decades that anyone who doubts them is abused
 yahi vajah he ki unke bhakt- 96 saal main sai baba ke nidhan ke baad-unke uttaradhikari kii pratiksha karenge
 According to Baba's prediction, his successor would come from Gunparthi village in Mandya district of Karnataka in 2030, hence his normal life in Puttaparthi soon became normal after the panic spread due to his serious illness
 trust agar samuhik netritv kaa rasta apanaae to baba ke sthapit kiye gaye lakshyon ko puraa karnaa shaayad mushkil nahin hoga
 The trust is not short of money and resources
 gadabad tabhi ho sakati he jab prabandhan main logon ke nihit swaarth janhit se upar ho jaaen
 If the situation gets out of control, the Andhra Pradesh government will be forced to come forward

 saujany:newsflicks IIT Delhi director Raghunath KS Shivgaonkar has resigned amidst queries, while the HRD ministry has given a statement on his resignation
 mantralay kaa kahana he ki nideshak par istife ke liye kisi tarah kaa dabaav nahin tha
 Also, Saschin and Subramanian Swamy have nothing to do with the case
 shivaganvkar kaa abhi do saal se adhik kaa kaarykaal bachaa hua tha
 Significantly, in the circumstances in which Shivgaonkar resigned from his post, it is alleged that the Ministry of Human Resource Development was pressurizing him
 shivaganvkar ne iaiti nideshak mandal ke adhyaksh vijay pi bhatkar ko shuukravaar raat ko apana tyaagptr bheja tha
 As a reason for his resignation, he has cited 'personal reasons'
 shivaganvkar ne ravivaar ko kaha ki unhone ek vivaad paidaa hone ke baad istipha de diya he
 Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has also been dragged into the controversy
 duusari ore, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne dabaav ke aaropon kaa kaa khandan kiya he
 There are allegations that Shivgaonkar resigned after he allegedly refused to accept the two demands of the HRD ministry
 ye maangen thim iaiti dilli ke maidan main tendulkar ko kathith taur par apni cricket academy kholane ke liye dena or iaiti dilli ke purv faikalti or ab bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ko 1972 se 1981 ke bich unke bakaayaa vetan ke taur par takreeban 70 lakh rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa
 After the meeting of the officials, the statement was given by the Ministry of Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani after the iit-delhi Director called for the resignation of the officers
 mantralay ne ek vaktavy main kaha ki vah khabar ‘tathyaatmak rup se galat’ he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki shivaganvkar ne dabaav kaa virodh karte hue istipha diya
 The statement said that the Ministry of Human Resource Development is being unnecessarily dragged into the issue, where the ministry has not issued any instructions
 mantralay ne kaha, 'na to cricket academy chalaane ke vaaste iaiti ke maidan ke liye sachin tendulkar kii ore se koi anurodh aayaa he or na hi use dene ke liye maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne koi nirdesh diya he
 "the Ministry of Human Resource Development has neither sent Subrahmanyam Swamy's request to IIT Delhi nor has any instructions been given to Swamy to pay the dues," the statement said
 diopiti or vitt mantralay kii is par raay maangi gai he
 Tendulkar has also expressed his grief through Twitter after Sachin has dragged his name in favor
 unhone kaha, 'main in khabaron ko padhakar aashcharyachakit hum ki iaiti dilli se mere naam par academy ke liye koi jameen maangi gai he
 i have neither planned an academy nor do i want any land for any purpose
 ' ek anya twit main sachin ne kaha, 'mere naam kaa istemaal kar is tarah kii kaalpanik baat prakashit karne se pehle mujhase buniyadi tathyon kii jaanch kar lee jaae
 'there is talk between the government and the Board of Directors, who have also expressed shock over the issue of their dues with Shivgaonkar's resignation
 unhone kaha ki maamla sarkaar or nideshak mandal ke bich he
 He said, 'directors do not come from anywhere in the picture
 ' swami ne aarope lagaaya ki istipha maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke kathith taur par unke bakaae kaa hisaab-kitaab karne ko kehane ke liye nahin he balki iaiti dilli kaa campus morishas main sthapit karne ko lekar he
 Swamy said, 'to hide the fact that meant that his post of director was definitely known, he tried to take political advantage of it
 ' maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne bayaan main kaha, 'iaiti dilli ke adhyaksh ne nideshak kaa tyaag patr 26 disambar kii shaam ko uchit prakriya kaa paalan kar niyokta praadhikaar ke faisle ke liye bhej diya he
 Resignation can only be accepted by employer authority
 ' mantralay ne kaha ki yah raashtrapati ke paas unki manjuuri ke liye jayega, kyonki vah iaiti dilli ke visitor hai
 Alumnae Association not happy with the resignation: Ashok Kumar, president of iiit-delhi Alumni Association, said that all the alumni of the institute are not happy with Shivgaonkar's resignation
 unhone kaha, 'samoochaa iaiti-dilli elumanai cameti nideshak ke saath he
 'congress leader and former MP from northeast Delhi Jai Prakash Agarwal has demanded an inquiry into Shivgaonkar's resignation
 dilli ke purv mukhyamantri or 'aap' netaa arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki yah behad dukhad he ki shivaganvkar ko istipha dena padaa
 He expressed surprise that the autonomy of the iits was being challenged
 kejariwal khud bhi iaiti khadgpur ke chaatr rahe hai
 Shivgaonkar became the director of IIT Delhi in 2011
