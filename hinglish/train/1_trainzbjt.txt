 The law must reflect contemporary realities of society and help the country's progress
 ’’ Regarding the recently issued Crime Law (amendment) Ordinance to amend the laws related to sexual offenses, he said, "we did not include marital rape in the ordinance for various reasons
" unamem se ek yah he ki hamaare desh main vivaah ko anya loktantric deshon kii tarah anubandh nahin mana jaataa he

 ’’ The hearing, which began in the Supreme Court on the issue of triple talaq from May 11, ended on Thursday
 court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The court can give its verdict in this case anytime
 court main is mudde par puure 6 dinon tak bahes chali, is dauraan bahes main kai mode aaye
 On behalf of the Central Government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi presented his arguments, while Kapil Sibal argued on behalf of All India Muslim Personal Board
 5 jajon kii peeth ne kii sunwyeepradhan nyaayadhish nyaayamurti jagadish singh khehar ke netritv vaali paanch nyaayadhishon kii sanvaidhanik peeth teen talaak kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti dene vaali yachikaaon kii sunwaayee kii
 The bench consisted of Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman, Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice Uday Umesh Lalit and Justice S
K
 abdul nazeer shaamil hai
 The triple talaq is a painful practice - Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the Center, termed the triple talaq as 'misdemeanor' and requested the court to take steps in this case as 'guardian of fundamental rights'
 ' desh ke bantwaare ke vakt ke aatank tathaa aghat ko yaad karte hue unhone kaha ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 ko samvidhan main isliye shaamil kiya gaya tha, taaki sabake liye yah sunishchit ho sake ki unki dharmik bhaawanaaon ke buniyadi mulyon par rajya koi hastkshep na kar sake
 Ram is a matter of faith, so why not triple talaq Counsel Kapil Sibal on behalf of All India Muslim Personal Law Board said that triple talaq has been going on for the last 1400 years
 agar ram kaa ayodhya main janm hona, aasthaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he to teen talaak kaa mudda kyon nahin
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said that the Center is still debating triple talaq but it is against all the existing methods of divorce
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar is mudde par ek kadam aage badhaakar vidheyak laane ko bhi taiyaar he
 'the matter is not majority vs
 minority' Center said that the matter is not majority vs
 minority

 In this case, the Center will do what it needs to do to get a bill, but the question is what will the Supreme Court do? The Chief Justice thereafter held that the Supreme Court cannot ignore untouchability, child marriage or other social evils operating within Hindutva
 court is maamle main apni jimmedaari se inkaar nahin kar saktaa he
 Why can't we end triple talaq? During the hearing, Mukul Rohatgi said that if countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Sudan have abolished laws like triple talaq, then why can't we
 atarni general mukul rohtagi ne peeth se kaha, agar adaalat turant talaak ke tareeke ko nirast kar detii he to ham logon ko alag-thalag nahin chodenge
 We will introduce a law for the regulation of marriage and divorce among the Muslim community
 abhi sirf teen talaak par sunwyeesupreme court ne kaha tha ki ham sirf ye samiksha karenge ki talaak-e-biddat yani ek baar main teen talaak or nikaah halaala islam dharm kaa abhinn ang he yaa nahin
 The court will also look at this issue from the point of view whether the fundamental rights of Muslim women are being violated by triple talaq or not
 haalanki court ne baad main kaha ki vah abhi teen talaak par sunwaayee karegaa, lekin vah in muddon par bhi sunwaayee kar saktaa he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court has now reserved its decision
 court is mudde par kabhi bhi apana faisla suna saktaa he, jis par puure desh kii nazar rahegi

 Ten months of 2016 have passed
 ab november ke din badhane ke saath hi yah sawaal bhi uthne laga he ki is baar sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film koun-si hogi
 If you look at the current figures, according to this, Salman Khan's 'sultan' is on top
 film kii kamai kareeb 300 karod he
 So at number two is Sushant Singh Rajput's film 'M' on the life of cricketer Dhoni
 es
 Dhoni's
 film kii kamai 132 karod bataai ja rahi he
 And which films are in the list Mentees third, fourth and fifth, together on three consecutive positions, Akshay Kumar
 unki film 'airlift' 129 karod kii kamai ke saath tisare number he
 'rustom' fourth and 107 with around 127 crores
 70 karod ke saath housephul 3'
 Is at number five
 shahrukh khan kii'fain'100 karod club main to shaamil nahin hai lekin 84 karod kii kamai ke saath yah hit filmon kii list main chathe number par he
 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' is at number 7, earning 80 crores in the first week of release
 abhi film theatres main chal rahi he to yahaan se list main pherbadal ho saktaa he
 At number 8 is 'bagi' Tiger Shroff
 unki is film kii kamai he 76 karod
 Sonam Kapoor's 'neerja' is at number nine with a gross of 75 crores
 10wein number par philhal he 'kapur and sans' jisaki kamai 73 karod he
 However, this list may change as 'shivaay' has earned 70 crores in the first week
 philhal ise theatres mili hue hai to kamai kaa aankada upar ja saktaa he
 What can turn the dice 
 
 2016 main kamai karne vaali top 10 filmon main philhalasalmaan khanhi 'sultan' hai
 No film has been able to stand before them
 aise main ummid kii ja rahi he ki saal kii sabase badi hit is baar salmaan khan ke naam hi hogi
 But Aamir Khan is coming in December to challenge Salman in his own style
 unki film ke craij kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki'dangal' ke trailrane sabase zyada hits kaa record banaaya
 Then Aamir's films are very strong in every respect
 aise main ummid yahi he ki kamai ke akhaade main top pojishan ke liesalmaan or amiramen jabardast dangal hone vaala he
 Meanwhile, Shahrukh's 'dear Zindagi' is also coming
 haalanki film ke trailor ko achche vyuj or rivyus mil rahe hai
 But such sweet films often do not get much collection on single screen
 aise menshahrukhbaaki donon khans ke liye bada khatra nahin lag rahe hai
 But even then it is a mine war, so when can someone decide whom to do, it cannot be said
 
 
 9 agast 2018 ko rajyasabha main hue upasabhapati chunaav main endie ke harivansh singh ne badi jeet darj kii
 This victory of the Modi government in the upper house is being interpreted in a big way, it is seen as a big dent in opposition unity
 lekin agar samay kii ghadi ko thodaa peeche ghumaayenge, to thik ek saal pehle 8 agast, 2017 ko gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko karaari haar mili thi
 That is, BJP has now accounted for that big defeat a year ago
 darasal, 8 agast 2017 ko gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav ke liye voting hui thi
 But that drama had run so long that by the time the result came, it was August 9
 yani thik ek saal baad bijepi ne apni us haar kaa hisaab upasabhapati chunaav se baraabar kiya
 The only difference is that it was the election of the Rajya Sabha MP and this election of the Deputy Chairman
 tab kaise ahamed patel ne di thi shah ko maat
 
 
 a similar picture was made in the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat last year
 usamen bhi ek-ek vot kii ladaai thi
 That election was also made a question of prestige by BJP
 lekin ain vakt par ahamed patel baazeegar sabit hue the
 a total of 176 votes were cast in the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat
 inamen se 2 vot radd kar die gaye, jiske chalate 174 voton kii counting kii gai thi
 Once seen losing, Ahmed Patel managed to win at the last moment
 unhone bijepi ummidavaar balavant rajput ko shikast di thi
 Highvoltage drama was played throughout the day in that election
 amit shah khud gujarat main deraa daale baithe the
 The fight was such that from Gujarat to Delhi the Election Commission was stirring
 congress do vidhayakon ke vot radd karwaane ke chakkar main der raat hi chunaav ayog ke daravaaje par pahunch gai thi
 To weaken this effort of the Congress, the BJP sent a delegation of 6 Union Ministers to the Election Commission
 antat ahamed patel ne chunaav main jeet hasil kii thi, us dauraan gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ise bijepi ke liye bada jhatka mana gaya tha
 Now shah-modi's strategy defeated the united opposition
 
 
 upasabhapati chunaav se pehle endie rajyasabha main alpamat main tha or unke ummidavaar kii jeet bhi mushkil lag rahi thi
 But the modi-shah duo once again showed their game and the whole dice was completely reversed
 darasal, voting se pehle bijepi,odisha kii bijedy, telugana kii tiares, tamilnadu kii aiadmkko apane paksh main laane main safal hui
 While officially these three parties are not part of the NDA
 iske alaava YSR congress or aam aadmi party kaa voting main hissaa naa lenaa bhi endie ke paksh main gaya
 At the same time, the BJP also managed to defeat parties like the Akali Dal and Shiv Sena, its angry partners of the NDA
 donon dal bijepi se naaraaz bataae ja rahe the, lekin nitish kumaar ke baat karne ke baad donon ne sarkaar ke paksh main vot kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also thanked Uddhav Thackeray for supporting the government
 ek or endie ne apane aap ko ekajute rakhaa to vahiin vipaksh apana ummidavaar bhi antim samay tak tay nahin kar paaya tha
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Monday used the word 'hitler' in signs for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ittefaq hi he ki ek din pehle hi, isi desh ke ek mukhyamantri ne farmaaya ki unhen hitler kahalaane main koi aapatti nahin he
 This is the new chief minister of Telangana
 chandrashekhar raav
 He admitted on Sunday that he had been called Hitler and did not feel any shame about it
 unhone kaha, 'bhrashtachariyon ke liye main hitler hi hum or galat chijen rokane ke liye agar jarurat padi to main hitler se bhi bura ban jaaoongaa
 'K
 chandrashekhar raav sarkaar kii ore se prastaavit surveykshan kaa bachaav kar rahe the, jis par kareeb 20 karod rupee kaa kharch aana he

 com / fap4faqkoc— Salman Khan (@beingsalmankhan)march 19, 2018 Top sources in the government say that the functioning of the banks will become normal by the end of this month, as the printing of new notes of Rs 2,000 notes is almost complete, and the new notes of more than two lakh ATM machines across the country Re-calibrating by size is also likely to be completed by then, which will reduce the cash crisis
 sutron ne bataaya he ki sarkaar kaa vichaar he ki band kiye ja chuke 500 or 1,000 rupee ke puraane noton ko nae noton se badale jane kaa kaam bilkul band kar diya jaae, or phir jab bainkon kaa kaamkaaj saamaanya ho jaae, or atm 2,000 rupee ke nae note nikaalane lagen, tab puraane noton ko sirf bainkon main jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 The government has already reduced the limit of replacing old notes with new ones, and instead of Rs 4,500 only old notes of Rs 2,000 will be replaced from Friday
 bank yaa daakghar ke zariye note badalane kii anumati bhi sirf ek baar ke liye he, lekin puraane noton ko bainkon main jamaa karaane kii antim tithi 30 disambar he
 Since 8 November, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the sudden closure of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, long queues of people outside the banks have been waiting for hours to replace the old notes
 isse saamaanya banking kaamkaaj kaaphi prabhavit hua he
 The central government, which is facing criticism for the problems facing the common people, has rejected the allegation of opposition parties that demonetization or demonetisation was not planned properly
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki ghoshnaa achaanak kiya janaa zaruri tha, taaki kaala dhan yaa aghoshit dhan rakhane waalon ko us dhan ko badalane kaa mauka na mil sake
 The comments sutron ne bataaya ki band kiye gaye noton kii jagah lene ke liye 500 or 1,000 rupee ke nae noton ke sthaan par pehle 2,000 rupee ke note chhapane kaa faisla bhi isiilie kiya gaya, kyonki sari karrwai ko gupt rakhte hue sabase kam samay main dhan ko badalane kaa yahi tarika tha
 By the way, now the government has also issued a new 500 rupee note
 band kiye gaye note deshbhar main chal rahe kul noton kaa 86 pratishat hissaa the, or unhen badalane ke liye ab bank pranali zordaar dabaav main he
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reiterated on Thursday that the printing of new notes, which started about two months ago from Zorshore, is resulting in an adequate supply of new notes
 reserve bank of india ne janata se aagrah kiya he ki ve ghabaraaen nahin, or nae noton kii jamkhori na karen
 Sources have said that the government is of the view that the replacement of old 500 and 1,000 rupee old currency notes with new ones should be stopped altogether, and then when the functioning of the banks becomes normal, and atms of Rs 2,000 When new notes start to be withdrawn, then the old notes can only be deposited in banks
 sarkaar puraane noton ko nae noton se badale jane kii seemaa pehle hi gata chuki he, or 4,500 rupee ke sthaan par shuukravaar se sirf 2,000 rupee ke puraane note hi badale ja sakenge
 The exchange of notes through bank or post office is also allowed only for one time, but the last date for depositing old notes in banks is December 30
 8 november se hi, jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 500 or 1,000 rupee ke noton ko achaanak band kar dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi, bainkon ke baahar logon kii lambii-lambii kataren ghanton lagi rahati hai, taaki puraane noton ko badalawaaya ja sake
 This has greatly affected normal banking operations
 aam logon ko ho rahi pareshaani ke liye aalochana jhel rahi centre sarkaar ne vipakshi dalon ke is aarope ko khaarij kar diya he ki vimudrikaran yaa notebandi kii yojana sahi tareeke se nahin banaai gai thi
 The government says that the announcement had to be made suddenly, so that those possessing black money or undisclosed money could not get a chance to change that money
 tippaniyan Sources said that to replace the discontinued notes, it was also decided to print the first 2,000 rupee notes in place of the new notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees, because the money was changed in the shortest time keeping all the action secret
 This was the way of vaise, ab sarkaar ne 500 rupee kaa nayaa note bhi jari kar diya he
 The discontinued notes were 86 percent of the total currency notes circulating in the country, and the bank system is now under tremendous pressure to replace them

 "prime Minister Narendra Modi said these things from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15 August last year
 saal bhar biit gaya
 Modi may not even remember these things, but the question of repeating them is different

 So, Modi may announce more populist schemes in his second Independence Day address, but his opponents are questioning the practicality of the five schemes which he announced last August

 ' In the politics of UP, two opposing parties Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party have decided to come together after 25 years
 upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main sanyukt press conference kar sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or basapa supremeo mayawati ne siton ke bantwaare par se suspence khatm kar diya or 38-38 siten apane paas rakh leen
 In the press conference, Mayawati announced to contest 38-38 seats in total 80 seats for both the SP and BSP parties, and said that the remaining 2 seats will be left for the allies and the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli for the Congress
 enditivi ko sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, sapa-basapa gathbandhan main jin do siton ko sahyogiyon ke liye choda gaya he, ve donon siten choudhary ajit singh kii rashtriya lokdal ke khate main jaaengi
 In fact, in the meeting of Mayawati and Akhilesh in Delhi on January 4, the formula for giving RLD two seats was decided
 ye do siten muzaffarnagar or bagpat hai
 Chaudhary Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat
 magar buudhvaar ko jayant choudhary ne akhilesh yadav se milakar kairana, mathura or hathras kii siten bhi maangi
 RLD candidate Tabbasum Hassan won the by-election with the support of SP on the Kairana seat
 akhilesh ne sapa ke cote se RLD ko do or siten dene kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha, par hathras seat basapa ke cote main pehle hi ja chuki he
 However, the RLD doors at Kairana and Mathura seats have not been closed yet
 do siton par areldi kii ab bhi baat ban sakati he
 If sources are to be believed, while Akhilesh Yadav is ready to give the seat to RLD from his quota, Mayawati is not ready to give a single seat to RLD from her quota
 baharhaal, is maheene kii 15 taarikh ke baad akhilesh or jayant choudhary kii mulaaqaat phir hogi jisamen teble par baith kar pashchimi uttar pradesh main RLD ke saath talmail baitaane par charchaa hogi
 At the same time, SP can also give one seat to Nishad Party and one seat to OP Rajbhar
 sapa nishad party ke sanjay nishad ko sapa ke simbel par chunaav ladayegi
 It is believed that the SP OP is trying to bring Rajbhar along for a big benefit
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki opi rajbhar mahagathbandhan main aate hai to wo apane saath apane chaar vidhayak bhi laaenge
 In such a situation, with the arrival of four mlas, one Rajya Sabha seat will also be claimed
 aise main rajbhar ko seat dena sapa ke liye faayde kaa sauda he
 OP Rajbhar is currently in alliance with the BJP and is trying to pressure the BJP by demanding more than two seats for himself in the Lok Sabha elections

 In Dadri in Uttar Pradesh's district Gautam Budh Nagar, police have arrested a woman who killed her own son after giving a betel
 katl ke aarope main police ne mahila samet kul paanch logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The woman's son-in-law is also among the accused
 police ke mutabik unhen pichley 18 june ko dadri ke kot gaanv pul ke paas ek laash mili thi
 The killing was done with sand
 jab police ne cese kii jaanch shuru kii to sabase pehle marane vaale kii pahchaan kii gai, uskaa naam anshul tha
 Asunal was just 20 years old and lived with her mother nearby
 shuruyaat main police ko cese se judaa koi suraag nahin mila
 Anshul had no enmity with anyone and there was no looting, so the police could not understand who would have benefited by killing Anshul
 is bich police ko anshul kii maa ke avaidh sambandhon ke bare main jaankaree mili
 Police found out that where Anshul's house was, Anshul's mother had a relationship with the priest of a nearby temple
 ye baat dhire-dhire puure gaanv main fail gai thi
 When Anshul came to know about this, he tried to stop his mother but did not listen to his mother
 is baat par maa or bete ke bich aksar jhagada hone laga
 It is difficult to believe what happened after that, according to the police, when the son started getting obstructed by the mother's way, the mother conspired to remove her son from the path
 iske liye usne mandir ke pujari se baat kii or saath main apane damaada amit ko bhi mila liya
 Then everyone together gave an amount of 35 thousand rupees for killing Anshul
 iske baad 18 june ko bhaade ke hatyaron ne anshul kii galaa ret ke hatya kar di
 When the police questioned the woman and the priest for custody, they both confessed their crime
 iske baad police ne amit or uske do saathiyon ko bhi giraftaar kar liya
 After being the national coach for nearly two decades, Gurbax Singh Sandhu will step down after the London Olympic Games and he wants his disciple Vijender Singh to give him a better medal than the bronze medal he won in Beijing four years ago as a farewell gift
 sandhu ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hi bharat ko vijender ke rup main pehla olympic padak vijeta mukkebaaz mila tha
 Sandhu, who was appointed senior national coach in the year 1993, said that this time if the Indian team of seven boxers participating in the Olympics improves their performance of a bronze medal in Beijing, then they will be satisfied and say goodbye to their post
 sandhu ne kaha, ‘main vaise bhi agle saal enaies coach ke pad se sevanivrutt ho jaataa kyonki meri umr 60 baras ho jaaegi
 But anyway i did not want to continue in my post beyond London
 ummid he ki is baar pradarshan pichhali baar se behatar rahegaa
 i enjoyed my career and i am a very satisfied person
 ’unhone kaha, ‘is saal bhartiya mukkebaaji mahasang ke bhi chunaav hone hai or yah unka faisla hoga ki main rashtriya coach bana rahun yaa nahin lekin nijee taur par main landan khelon ke baad apana pad chhodana chahta hum
 'sandhu, who took the responsibility of coaching for the first time in the year 1978, has seen a lot of ups and downs in Indian boxing and he is also sometimes surprised by the way the sport has progressed in the country
 sandhu ne kaha, ‘ek samay aisa tha jab ladakon ke paas cycle bhi nahin hoti thi lekin aaj ve videshi kaaron main ghoomte hai
 i am very happy to see this change
 ye ladke padak hi nahin jeet rahe balki vittiya taur par apane bhavishya ko bhi surakshit kar rahe hai jiskaa matlab he ki yah khel yahaan se aage hi badhegaa
 Sandhu said that the recent success in boxing was a result of the collective efforts of him and assistant coaches Jaydev Bisht, c Kutappa and Ramanand and Cuban coach BI Fernandez and support staff
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke skool kii chauthi kaksha main padhane vaali bacchee ke saath dushkarm kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 It is alleged that the school employee raped the girl in the school premises
 police ne aaropee ko hiraasat main lekar maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 This whole matter is about the primary school of Municipal Corporation in Shahdara area
 skool ke ek safai karmchaaree ne 10 saal kii bacchee ko daraa-dhamkaakar kaksha ke peeche ek khaali kamare main is vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 The accused threatened to kill the victim
 ghatana ke baad se bacchee ne khaanaa pinaa chhod diya or tabiyat kharaab hone lagi
 According to the information, the 9-year-old victim is originally from UP
 peedita shahdara ilaake main apni mausi ke saath rahakar shahdara sthit nigam skool main padhati he
 The case was revealed when the girl did not go to school on the second day of the incident and her health deteriorated
 parijan use aspataal le gaye tab jaakar doctor ko andeh hua or jab bacchee se poocha gaya to usne aapbeetee bataai
 According to police, the case has been registered and the accused has been taken into custody
 nihaal vihaal main 7 saal kii bacchee kii hatyanihaal vihaar ilaake main ek saat saal kii bacchee kaa apharan ke baad berahami se hatya kar di gai
 The baby's body was found in a park on Sunday morning
 gharavaalon ke mutabik saat saal kii bacchee apni choti bahan ke saath ghar se baahar kuch khaane-pine kii chije laane ke liye nikali thi
 a 7-year-old innocent girl was abducted on Saturday night and murdered in a park near her house
 bacchee ke pita kaa kahana he ki agar shikaayat ke fouran baad hi police ne bacchee ko dhundhane ke liye jor lagaaya hota to shaayad aaj unki ladli zindaa hoti
 The family members have told that they tried hard to find the child at their level last night but to no avail
 itnaa hi nahin aaj subah bhi bacchee kii laash police ne nahin balki gharavaalon ne hi dekhi
 According to people, the girl's hands were tied, there was a noose around her neck and her head was severely crushed with stones
 ab police is maamle main un raaston ke sisitivi footage khangaal rahi he jin raaston se is park kii taraf pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 When Arvind Kejriwal had raised the corruption of corruption in the last Vidhan Sabha elections, it was not thought that it would be a hit but when the results came, it came to know its importance
 us party ko jise aalochak das siten bhi nahin de rahe the, vah satta ke behad kareeb pahunch gai
 This time it is again in front of the people and Kejriwal is roasting it well
 dilli aaj tak ke ek jaminidervekshanse yah baat saamne ai he ki aaj bhi dilli waalon ke saamne bhrashtachar sabase bada mudda he or uske baad hi mahangaai he
 Surprisingly, despite increasing cases of crime, it is still not the biggest issue here, whereas after the Nirbhaya incident it was boiled down to a metropolis like
 dilli aaj tak ke sanvadadaataaon kunal, swati, shashanki or priyanka ne mahanagar kii gali-gali jaakar matadaataaon se baatcheet kii or unke vichaar jane
 He gave some written questions to the voters to which he also duly answered
 is surveykshan se pataa chalata he ki dilli ke liye sabase bada mudda bhrashtachar he
 35 per cent believed that this was the biggest issue while inflation was the biggest issue for 29 per cent
 vikaas bhi yahaan ek bada mudda he lekin hairaan kar dene vaali baat he aparaadh abhi chauthe number par he
 After this comes the number of electric-water
 bhrashtachar ko bada mudda maanane ke peeche kaaran yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki dilli main pheri waalon, rehadi-patari waalon or chote dukandaaron ke alaava lakhon aise log hai jinhen rishwat dene ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Police, municipality, transport department, etc
 are the biggest reasons for this
 dilli ke log inase nijaat chaahate hai
 One more thing came out of this survey that even though the Aam Aadmi Party may feel that it is close to victory in the elections, the fugitive stamp on its leader Arvind Kejriwal is still not erased
 survey ke mutabik lagbhag 43 fisadi voter unhen abhi bhi bhagoda hi maanate hai
 Despite this image of him, 50 percent of the people consider him the best candidate for CM
 kai loksabhaa kshetron main unhen kiran bedi ke mukaable kaaphi badhat mili
 In New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency where Kiran Bedi resides and from where Arvind Kejriwal won, 51 percent people supported him
 kiran bedi ke paksh main sirf 35 fisadi log aae jabaki ajay maakan ko sirf 9 fisadi logon kaa hi saath mila
 On Modi wave ups and downs, one thing has emerged from this survey that Narendra Modi is on ups and downs
 is surveykshan main bhaag lene vaale logon main se aadhe se bhi kam yani 46 fisadi ne mana ki modi lahar he
 For example, if 48 percent of the people in the New Delhi area believed that there was a Modi wave, then only 39 percent of the people in West Delhi believed it while 47 percent in North East Delhi believed it
 sirf purvi dilli main yah aankada 50 ke paar rahaa
 This survey shows that the Congress is nowhere in the mind of the people and 73 percent people believe that the performance of the Congress will not be better than the last time

 rus kaa jhukaav, bharat kii chintabharat kaa rus se rishta kaaphi purana he, lekin ab teji se badalte bhu-raajnneetik hakeekat ke bich isamen badlaav aa rahaa he
 The top leaders of the two countries are in constant contact with each other, but differences on many issues have increased
 bharat ko chintaa is baat kii he ki rus kaa jhukaav pakistan kii taraf bhi bad rahaa he
 Historically, Russia has often supported India in the UN Security Council and has been continuously vetoing the proposals on the Kashmir issue
 lekin aaj dakshin asia ko lekar rus kii praathamikta badal rahi he
 The Joint Declaration, which was released at a six-nation conference in December 2017, supported Pakistan's stand on Kashmir

 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who visited India in December 2017, openly stated that India should join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China
 yahi nahin, lavarove ne bharat ke america, japan or australia ke saath milakar bharat-prashanth kshetra main ek quadrillatural banane kii koshish par naaraazgi bhi jaahir kii
 Global politics Despite all efforts by the top leadership of India and Russia, differences in bilateral relations between the two countries are increasing
 isaki vajah vaishvik vaataavaran main ho rahe sanrachanaatmak badlaav hai
 It is important for Russia not to let American-led Western countries dominate in South Asia
 duusari taraf pashchimi jagat vaishvik raajnneeti main rus ko sabase vinaashkari takat maanata he
 Security needs are important for India so that the rise of China in this area should curb the negative things that are happening
 dakshin asia or hind mahaasaagar ilaake main abhi tak jo paramparaagat rup se bharat kaa prabhaav bana hua he, usamen china dakhal dene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Not only this, the growing power imbalance between India and China has made the border situation more unstable
 china-pakistan kaa gathjod majboot ho rahaa he or isaki vajah se bharat ko dohare morche par chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Therefore, India is trying to create such an alternative platform with like-minded countries to curb Chinese aggression in india-pacific region
 jaahir he ki ateet ko yaad karne vaali bhavukta se hi kaam nahin chal saktaa, kyonki bharat or rus ke saamne ab nae tarah kii chunautiyaan khadi hui hai

 Have you ever heard that a robber himself does not know how much he was robbed? That too when it is worth crores? How can anyone forget such a huge amount? Might forget, when he has no account of these money
 dilli kii sabase badi lut kaa sabase bada sach yahi he ki philhal kisi ko yahi nahin pataa ki koun lutaa or kitna lutaa? lut kii rakam kitni thi chah karod, aath karod yaa 15 karod? aisa pehali baar he jab khud lutane vaala chupa rahaa he ki aakhir lutere usase kitne karod lut kar le gaye? wo ye bhi chupa rahaa he ki lut kii rakam main bhartiya karansi ke alaava videshi karansi kitni thi? wo ye bhi chupa rahaa he ki itane saare paise kahaan se aae or kahaan ja rahe the?lutane vaale kaa he purana recordis baar lutane vaale or luutane vaale donon hi police ke shaq ke ghere main hai
 The reason for this is not only the large amount of loot but also the old record of the people who were robbed
 wo record jo shaq paidaa karata he ki luti gai rakam kaa taalluk jurm ke kisi badi sindicket kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 On Tuesday, the amount robbed in a Honda City car in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi belonged to Rajesh Kalra and his partner
 ye vahi rajesh kalra he jo 2000 main desh main match phixing ke sabase bade bavaal ke baad villen kii tarah saamne aayaa tha
 Rajesh Kalra was accused that at the behest of bookie Sanjeev Chawla, he bought the phone to Captain Hansi Cronje of South Africa
 or usee phone par chronie sanjeev chawla ko match ke bare main saare apadet detaa tha
 After the match fixing was revealed, Rajesh Kalra was caught and also imprisoned
 13 saal baad ritairement se ain pehle dilli police ke kamishnar niraj kumaar ne match phixing ke bare main chargeshit taiyaar karwaai or adaalat main pesh kiya
 Rajesh Kalra is also named in this charge sheet
 haalanki wo jamaanat par baahar he
 The location, manner and timing of the incident are related to many questions
 Lajpat Nagar area of south Delhi is one of the most busy routes in Delhi
 vah dilli ke sabase zyada trephic vaale ilaake main se ek he
 However, the robbers choose the same place for the crime
 tamaam khatra mol lekar
 After this, it takes a total of 25 minutes from Rajesh Kalra's house to mouka-e-vardat and then to the incident
 phir chaar kaaron ke is khel main ek sabase ahm car jisamen ki sicurity guard gan ke saath baitha tha, bas usee kii car peeche rah jaati he
 Why? Flashback: How the robbery happened around 9 am from Rajesh Kalra's house Kalkaji, with his manager Rakesh Sharma, leaving four bags in two bags and leaving with four people in Honda City
 paanchon ko karol baag or conot place janaa tha
 He was followed by an i-ten car to escort Honda City
 jisamen rajesh kalra kaa sicurity guard or do logon ke saath licency gan ke saath chal rahaa tha
 But on reaching the BRT corridor under Moolchand flyover, the i-ten car lags behind due to traffic
 isi bich kareeb 9 baj kar 25 minute par pehle ek wagon aar car aati he or honda city ko takkar maarthe hue use overtek kar uske aage ruk jaati he
 As soon as the collision, the driver of the Honda City comes down and starts fighting with the driver of the wagon-r
 thik usee vakt peeche se ek safed varanaa car aati he
 Four-five people descend from it and take down the people riding in Honda City at gunpoint
 phir car main rakhe noton se bhare donon bag lekar usee honda city main faraar ho jate hai
 It is later revealed that both the Wagon r and the other were stolen cars
 honda city bhi lutere baad main kotla mubarakapur main sadak kinare chhod jate hai
 The information given to the police after 35 minutes of the robbery is such a huge robbery in broad daylight, but the information of the robbery is given to the police about 35 minutes after the incident
 police ke aane ke baad car main savaar log lutane kii baat to bataate hai par car main kitne paise the ye sahi-sahi nahin bataate
 People in the car show that the money belonged to Rajesh Kalra and his business partner Rahul Ahuja
 police ko shaq, 15 karod tak he lut kii rakamrajesh kalra or rahul ahuja police ke paas pahunch kar pehle yah bataate hai ki car main chah karod kuch lakh rupee the
 But the manager of Rajesh Kalra told that 4 crore 69 lakh in the car belonged to Rajesh Kalra while three crore belonged to Rahul Ahuja
 yani kul 7 karod 69 lakh rupee
 Apart from Indian currency, it also had Euro and Dollar
 videshi karansi kii jo maatra bataai gai he usko dekhte hue police ko shaq he ki luti gai rakam das se pandrah karod tak ho sakati he
 According to police sources, during interrogation of Rajesh Kalra, Rahul Ahuja, his manager and the driver, it was found that these people had been going to Karol Bagh and Connaught Place and other places in the same way by keeping crores of rupees in the car
 is dauraan akasar ye log 10 se 15 karod tak apane saath le jate the
 Did the looted money come from hawala? The biggest question before the police in the robbery was that why was someone carrying such a huge amount in a car? According to police sources, in the initial interrogation, Rajesh Kalra said that all the money came from a property deal in South Delhi
 police ne south dilli main pichley 15 dinon main hui property kii tamaam badi deal ke bare main jab chaanbin kii to pataa chalaa ki itani badi koi deal haal main hui hi nahin
 According to police sources, he later said that the money was found from a dealer in Chandni Chowk
 lekin ye baat bhi galat nikali
 Police sources say that Rajesh Kalra and his partner Rahul Ahuja have not been able to give any satisfactory answer about the money so far
 jis tarah vah baar-baar jhooth bol rahe hai usase saaf he ki paisa blike mani or hawala ke kaarobaar se judaa he
 In the interrogation of the biggest hawala racket, they had told that they were going to deposit all the money in different banks in Karol Bagh, Connaught Place and Chandni Chowk
 baad main pataa chalaa ki wo sahi kah rahe the, kyonki in jagahon par rajesh kalra or rahul ahuja donon ke hi alag-alag bainkon main khate hai
 According to police sources, it is possible to solve this robbery by exposing a big racket of hawala in Delhi
 sutron kii maane to rajesh kalra match phixing maamle main jamaanat par baahar aane ke baad se puri tarah khamosh tha
 Leaving Gurgaon, he settled in South Delhi and here he started the business of property dealing
 gudgaanv kaa rahul ahuja uskaa partner bana
 Police suspect that the property business was just for show
 luteron ke peeche he police kii 24 timendilli police ne luteron ko pakadaney ke liye apni puri takat jhonk di he
 Around 24 teams of Delhi Police are engaged in this work day and night
 inamen south, south east, krime branch, special cell or duusari jila kii kai police timen shaamil hai
 Apart from this, in view of the hawala case, Delhi Police is also taking help of the Income Tax Department in the investigation
 rajesh kalra, uskaa partner rahul ahuja or rajesh kalra kaa driver jo vaardaat ke vakt honda city car chalaa rahaa tha teenon hi haryana se hai
 Therefore, the police is taking forward the investigation of the case by putting the Haryana gang in front
 is silsile main ab tak haryana or bahari dilli ke kai ilaakon main chaape bhi maare ja chuke hai
 It is suspected that the people associated with the gang have a connection with Rohtak
 kisi andar ke shaks kii he mileebhagatpulice sutron ke mutabik luteron ke gang ko kisi andar ke hi shaks ne puri jaankaree di he
 Otherwise, when the robbers do not know how much money, which car and which way they are going to go, they do not know
 haalanki kisi bade gangster ke bhi is lutpaat ke peeche haath hone se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to the police, some prominent looters of Haryana, Neeraj Bawaniya, Vikas Lagarpuria and Neetu Dabodia's partner Paras are also being found in Haryana
 ye sabhi kuch vakt pehle hi jail se jamaanat par baahar aae hai or laapata hai

 Film Review: Bullet rajaactor: Saif Ali Khan, Sonakshi Sinha, Jimmy Shergill, Raj Babbar, Vidyul Jamwal, Gulshan Grover, Ravi Kishan, Mahi Gill (guest Appearance) Director: Tigmanshu dhuliaderuration: 2 hours 18 minutesstar: Two out of five in our U
P
 There was a Budhu Kakka in the settled village
 bujurg the or ekanali bandook taangkar chalate the
 He was the one who introduced us to the father of the gun
 kandhe par ek maala hoti thi unke
 Of cartridge
 usamen do tarah ke dane hote the
 LG and stuffed
 alji yani asal kaartoos jo jab kisi ko lage to jaan se jaae
 And stuffing, ie repackaging used cartridges
 shaadi-biyah ke maukon par fire thonkane ke liye
 Forgiver diarector tigmanshu dhulia ne ab tak khub alji fire maare
 From Haasth to Paan Singh Tomar and Sahib Bibi Gangster
 ham iske shikaar hue or unke mureed ho gaye
 But one has to write with great disappointment that Bullet Raja's bullet is stuffed
 isamen aawaaj to bahut he, magar maarak dam nahin
 In the pursuit of making commercial cinema, he has filled all the garbage between his forced dialogues, helical story and some of the best real characters
 bullate raja kahani he lakhanu main parivaar ke saath rahane vaale gathile badan ke noujvaan raja mishra kii
 One day the king wanders in search of a job, gets fight and arrives in a procession while beating
 yahaan unki mulaakaat hoti he rudra se
 On the same day, Rudra's unfortunate uncle of his relationship, Lallan, commits an attack on his house with his army torn
 morcha sambhalate hai raja or rudra or iske baad vah gundai ke changul main shuruaati hichak ke baad jarurat ke tark ke tahat funs jate hai
 When both get out of jail and commit a scandal, they get sow in the world of political protection
 phir donon ek netaa ke bahubali ban apana bhokaal tite karte hai
 Sometimes a bullet of raja-rudra and sometimes an enemy could not stand in front of the bull of a bullro rider
 isi dauraan unki ek dhanapashu ke saamne ed lag jaati he
 Only then does the Dilfenka king meet a Bengali Bala, who is straightforward
 ab film ection se line badal ishk kii patari par khisakane lagati he
 But looking at politics, it does not work
 so gum phirakar raja or rudra phir mardhaad ection or romaanch kii duniya main lautate hai
 a sacrifice is made and revenge is created
 is dauraan kai raajnneetik, police vaale or dhankuber is chausar par apni chaalen chalate hai
 For some time, a policeman named Arun Singh Munna, Chambal's watchman also comes and plays his role
 said main katal ke iljaam se farig hone ke liye intjaar main radha ban gaye ek eks hone kii kagaar par pahunche bahubali hai, jo kambek ke pher main phunfunate rahete hai
 Now when all these come, the heat will increase
 magar itani bhi kya ki aadmi anakhiya kar sab nipatane kaa intjaar karne lage
 Now let the film critic Wali Panchayat sit
 film main rudra ke role main patali moonch kaa bana dharkar aae jimi shergill ne acha kaam kiya he
 But this time his role was supporting
 main lead vaale saf ali khan ausat rahe
 The problem is that the role of his lame Tyagi himself has raised the scale very high for the role of such UP Mafia
 mana ki tyaagi dehati tha or raja misra shahari he, magar nabbe ke dashak main lakhanu or duusari uniwarsity se nikle mafia launde itane bhi halke nahin the ki pat se aashiqui main geele hue jaaen or phir chat se khunkhaar chattan main tabdeel ho jaaen
 Sonakshi Sinha's parts once again came up with Sharamana Itrana and two songs
 tamanchey par disco main vah katai maamuli lageen or desi adaa mumbai ke discs main unase dur hi rahi
 Yes, the romantic track Saan Hai Sawayra definitely saw some of their possibilities
 baaki sumer yadav ke role main ravi kishan ke liye gunjaaish thi or unhone ise bakhubi nibhaayaa bhi
 If Raj Babbar is average in the role of a leader, Vidyul Jamwal may be seen doing action, but he has to learn the whole story of acting
 maahi gil kaa item number is bharwaan film kaa ek or kamjor chharra rahaa
 It is important to mention more of an actor
 naam he rajeev gupta
 He is the same Rajiv whom you have seen as a Police Inspector in Paan Singh Tomar and who speaks a dialogue about the forgiveness of Paan Singh Dadda, o uniform, forgive us
 or yaad karnaa ho to sahib bivi gangster ke us netaa ko yaad kariye jo sahib ke gariyaane par memiati magar ghaagh maheen aawaaj main kahata he ki acha ji, badi acchhee baat boli aapane, note kar letaa hum
 Rajiv's part here came the role of a leader, there was not much to do, but as much as it was, he was frozen
 inhen aap jald hi aamir khan kii pike main bhi dekhenge
 Tigmanshu Dhulia is one of the most promising, talented and genuine filmmakers in our film industry
 unki kaabiliyat kaa andaja bataur casting diarector bandit queen main dikhaa to bataur dialog riter irfan or ashutosh rana vaali film hasil se
 Paan Singh Tomar told us how amazing he is
 magar is film main unke bheetar ke jeniyas ke bas kuch tiger trailor hi najar aae
 In the dialogues with Jabber Punch or elsewhere in the relationship and contradiction of UP politics and bullying
 magar film gaune main baandhi jane vaali naanaa prakaar ke pakwaanon se saji daliya kii tarah hota he, jisamen laddu ke saath maida vaali puri or kuch namakeen bhi baandha jaataa he
 This time, in his basket, goods of the same type and market appeared
 vah badi star cast or box offis par andhadhundh kamai ke moh main apane asal cinema ke saath samjhauta kar baithe
 The songs of the film seem to be from Thunje Gaye
 tital trek ke saath film shuru hoti he or abhi aap seat par apni pojishan le hi rahe hote hai ki maahi gil kaa item number dont tach maai body aa lagata he maathe par
 After that, tolerate the stakes and by then the spot is Disco on Tamanche, which still passes a few minutes with the rap of RDB
 kolkata kii galiyon main shoot kiya gaya slo romantic number saamne he savera acha he, magar tab tak gaanon kaa kota ufanane laga hota he
 Wherever the film will go and remember it for its dialogues
 inamen se kai aap trailor ke dauraan sunate hai or ummid se bhar jate hai
 For example, if the Brahmin was angry, Ravan or if we come, we will increase the heat
 magar bullate raja main har kirdaar itnaa kuch bolta he ki unke bich in panch sa asar dete dialogs ko sahejnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Saif and Jimmy's chemistry is frozen in the film, but not much time is left for it
 chote role vaale actor acha asar chhodte hai
 The film drags on in the first half and makes good progress in the role of making a role and in the second half
 to bullate raja dekhie agar aapako hindi pradesh kii katte tamanchey ke tewaron vaali bhashaa kaa lutf uthaanaa he, vahaan kii gundai ke kuch seen dekhne hai or dhany dhany vaala dhansu tevar pasand he
 This is a total masala film, but there is nothing very new in it
 isamen wo tigmanshu nahin he, jise ham ab tak jaanate aae hai or uske prati apana pyaar jataate aae hai
 In the film, there is a bullet carriage, a bullet cartridge, but a bull means that sitting on a bull is cool and does not have a dreadful attitude

 The beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan of Bala is known as a child of the country
 apni khubsuurati ke chalate vah puri duuniya main apni ek pahchaan banane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 But Aishwarya is not only known for her beauty but she is also famous for giving flop films in the Bollywood industry

 The magic of Aishwarya's films may not have been able to make the viewers head but a glimpse of her on the international platform is still awaited by the fans
 kaan festival ho yaa koi international beauty product kaa vigyaapan aishwarya aaj bhi in staron par shaayad most demanding indian actress hai
 As a media favorite, the stars try to stay in a publicity stunt or a contraption to get a foothold in Bollywood, but Ash's class is different
 unhen apane kariyar yaa fame ke liye in sab pantaron ke liye mehnat nahin kerani padati
 Aishwarya is lucky in this matter
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki unka naam industry ke bade diggajon ke saath judana
 The tag of daughter-in-law of the Bachchan family is also enough to keep her in the news and the other is still associated with her ex boyfriend and Bollywood's Sultan Salman Khan, despite wanting her name

 Karan Johar, one of the best directors of Bollywood, signed him for his film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil', despite the films being a flop
 isse to saaf he ki film chaahe flop hon lekin aishwarya to hit hi rahengi
 Aishwarya's Wine Beauty Aishwarya's beauty compared with the wine will not be wrong
 aaj(1 november) ko aishwarya 43 saal kii ho gai hai or is adaakara ke liye umr mahaj ek number hai
 The way the wine becomes as old as its test is fun, the beauty of Aishwarya is also similar
 umr ke saath saath vah or bhi nikharati ja rahi hai
 This is the reason why viewers are convinced of his bold style in his film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 iske peeche aishwarya kii fitness or mekaover ko lekar mehnat saaf jhalkati he
 That is why even today, the directors do not hold back in signing them with the young actors of Bollywood

 The criteria based on which states were assessed include the operation of health and welfare centers, provision of mental health services in the districts covered under NHM program and grading of primary health centers, etc
 parvatiy rajyon jammu-kashmir, himachal pradesh or uttarakhand par shart puraa nahin karne ko lekar dand lagaaya gaya he

 Today is the birth anniversary of Dr
 Bhim Rao Ambedkar, reputed as the creator of the Indian Constitution
 unhen desh main daliton or pichhadon ke maseehaa ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 B
 aar
 Ambedkar's full name was Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar
 unka janm indore kii mau chhavnee main 14 april, 1891 ko hua
 Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, honored with Bharat Ratna, was a jurist, Dalit thinker, politician and chief architect of the Indian Constitution, and was also a good writer
 desh main is baat kii bhi khub charchaa hoti he ki unke or rashtrapita ke rup main sammanit mahatma gandhi ke bich kai masalon par gahare matbhed the
 The most discussed among them was the status of untouchables
 gandhi is baat se inkaar karte the ki achhuton, pichhadon yaa daliton kii madad ke liye usee jati main paidaa hona jaruri he
 Similarly, Dr
 Ambedkar had many apprehensions about Gandhiji's deep affection for Hindutva
 alam yah tha ki dow ambedkar unhen mahatma maanane tak se inkaar karte the
 In spite of how much opposition there was between them, in many things he also had similarity with Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi ji kii tarah dow ambedkar kii bhi padhanellikhane main kaaphi ruchi thi
 He has written or edited many degrees and many books
 unki charchit kitabon main bharat kaa rashtriya ansh, bharat main jatiyaan or unka mashinikaran, bharat main laghu krishi or unke upachaar, mul nayak (saptahik), british bharat main samrajyavaadee vitt kaa vikendrikaran, rupaee kii samasya: udbhav or samaadhaan, british bharat main prantiy vitt kaa abhyuday, bahishkrut bharat (saptahik), janata (saptahik), jati viched, sangh banaam swatantraaa, pakistan par vichaar, shri gandhi evam achhuton kii vimukti, 'ranade, gandhi or jinna', 'congress or gandhi ne achhuton ke liye kya kiya', 'shudra koun or kaise', 'maharashtra bhashaai praant' or 'bhagwaan buddha or unka dharm' shaamil he
 It is also worth noting that when Ambedkar was angry with Gandhi and the casteist system of Hindutva, when he talked about conversion, he not only kept it at the urging of Mahatma for a long time but also his feelings of Mahatma Gandhi's absence
 Respecting Buddhism by not turning to Islam and Christianity
 ambedkar ne apane jivan ke antim dinon main 14 oktober, 1956 ko buddha dharm apanaaya tha
 They were breaking the network of the gods and imagining a free man who was religious but did not consider equality as life value
 6 disambar, 1956 unka prayaag hua
 It has been such a long time, but the relationship of these two great sons of India has always been at the center of discussion
 ambedkarwaadiyon or gandhivadiyon ke apane-apane tark hai or apni-apni vyakhya
 There have been many books on their relationship so far

 Apparently Arundhati has written this book originally in English under the name 'the Doctor and the Saint: Caste, Race and Annihilation of Caste: The Debate Between BR Ambedkar and MK Gandhi'

 Pawar said in the special court, "kasab has no connection with the conspirators of the 26 November attack
 use police ne sirf isliye giraftaar kiya kyonki vah pakistani he or police ke anusaar hamale kii sajeesh pakistan main rachi gai thi
 Earlier, Kasab had taken a similar stand before the court when he gave his statement after the evidence was recorded in the court
 pavaar ne kaha ki kasaab ne 26 november se ek pakhwaade pehle mumbai aayaa tha or police ne use upnagareey juhu choupati ilaake se us vakt giraftaar kiya tha jab vah vahaan gum rahaa tha
 Pawar told Special Judge ML Tahaliyani, "kasab is an innocent boy from a small village in Pakistan who became an easy target and target of police
 ’ pavaar ne kaha ki chunki hamalaa karne vaale sabhi 10 aatankwaadi maare gaye isliye police ko yah dikhaane ke liye kisi ko giraftaar karnaa tha ki ek shadyantrakaari ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 He said, 'the police has not been able to arrest the 35 absconding accused and is therefore targeting the innocent person
 ’ pavaar ke anusaar tasveeron, sisitivi footage or diene pareekshanon ke aadhaar par abhiyojan paksh dwaara pesh kiye gaye sakshya ‘farji, managasaint or avishwasaneey’ hai
 On Kasab confessing his guilt before the magistrate's court and pleading guilty before the special court, Pawar said it was done under police pressure
 unhone kaha, ‘police ne aashwaasan diya tha ki use kam sajaa di jaaegi or agar vah apana dosha kabool kar letaa he to use is jail se sthanantarit kar diya jayega
 Pawar later argued that the police taught the witnesses to give a statement against Kasab
 pavaar shuukravaar ko bhi apni daleel jari rakhenge
 After this, the counsel for two other accused, Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, will give their final arguments
 adaalat tab ek taarikh tay karegi jisamen vah maamle main apana faisla paarit karegi

 Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar, Sugandha Mishra and Roshni Chopra may soon appear in The Comedy Family Show alongside Sunil Grover
 yah sunil grover kaa sho he
 It is noteworthy that ever since Sunil Grover had some fight with Kapil Sharma in a flight, Sunil Grover has started keeping himself busy through his show
 tab se vah kai live sho kar chuke hai or dow mashhoor gulati kaa kirdaar or rinku bhabhi ke kirdaar se logon kaa manoranjan karte chale aa rahe hai
 It is a different matter that his lack in the Kapil Sharma show has always been missing
 ab sunil grover apana live sho kar rahe hai or is sho kaa ek nayaa poster jari ho chukaa he
 The show will be held in Ahmedabad on 27 May
 is sho ke poster se yah baat saaf he ki is sho main ali asagar, chandan prabhakar, sugandha mishra ke saath saath roshni chopra bhi dikhaa dene vaale hai
 For information, let us know that after Sunil Groval, Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar and Sugandha Mishra also left Kapil Sharma's show
 lekin ab ek baar phir ye sabhi ek sho main dikhaai denge
 It is clear from this poster that Sunil Groval has taken the lead role in the show
 da kamedi family sho ke poster main sunil grover bilkul vaise dikhaai de rahe hai jaise di kapil sharma sho ke postaron main kapil sharma dikhaai diya karte the
 In this poster, Sunil Groval is seen with the face of Dr
 Famous Gilati and Rinku Bhabhi
 saath hi ali asagar bhi dikhaai de rahe hai
 According to media reports, when Sunil Grover was asked why the TRP of The Kapil Sharma Show has come down, he said, no one has control over the ratings
 jab main bhi star plus ke pehle sho karata tha tab bhi reating ummid ke anusaar nahin thi
 Another question that your name was not even mentioned in the 100th episode of The Kapil Sharma Show, Sunil Groval said that i did not see that show, but what difference does it make that my name was not taken
 meraa naam nahin liya gaya tab bhi isse kya fark padataa he
 Wasn't i a part of the show? wo meraa bhi to sho tha
 The comments bataa den ki baroda main ek sho ke baad sunil grover ne ishaara kiya tha ki vah ek sho ke saath jald hi tivi par vaapasi karenge
 He had then made it clear that he had some offers, but he could not do it now
 unhone kaha tha ki soni ke saath meraa qaraar he or jab tak yah samay puraa nahin ho jaataa tab tak main kuch nahin kahuunga
 It is only right to think
 iske baad hi kuch kahuunga or ofer ke bare main baat karuunga
 At the same time, Ali Asgar, Sugandha Mishra, Chandan Prabhakar, who left Kapil Sharma's show, are still bound by Sony's agreement
 yah bataa den ki soni ke duusare sho main ye log aa rahe hai
 Sugandha Mishra has appeared in Indian Idol
 or sabase bada kalakaar main ali asagar or chandan prabhakar dikhaai de rahe hai
 It is being said that Sony has approached Sunil Grover for another show
 ummid he ki yah sho june se tivi par aayega
 Now Sunil Grover is doing his live show and a new poster of this show has been released
 yah sho 27 may ko ahmedabad main yojit hoga
 It is clear from the poster of this show that Ali Asgar, Chandan Prabhakar, Sugandha Mishra as well as Roshni Chopra are also going to show in this show
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki sunil grovel ke baad ali asagar, chandan prabhakar or sugandha mishra ne bhi kapil sharma kaa sho chhod diya tha
 But now once again all these will appear in a show

 Also appearing are Ali Asghar
 media reporton ke anusaar jab sunil grover se poocha gaya ki da kapil sharma sho kii tiarapy neeche kyon aa gai he tab unhone kaha, reating par kisi kaa control nahin hota
 Even when i used to do shows before Star Plus, the ratings were not as expected
 ek anya sawaal ki da kapil sharma sho ke 100 wein episod main aapkaa naam tak nahin liya gaya, sunil grovel ne kaha ki main vah sho nahin dekha, lekin isse kya fark pad jaataa he ki meraa naam nahin liya gaya
 Even if my name is not taken, what difference does it make
 kya main sho kaa hissaa nahin tha
 That was my show too
 tippaniyan Let me tell you that after a show in Baroda, Sunil Grover had indicated that he will return to TV soon with a show

 gharelu samarthan ke liye jo simaaen tay kii gai hai, unamem se antarnihit nunatam samarthan (kharid padhein) mulya ko hataa diya jaae
 First India and then South American countries held back the Bali Agreement (on the trade embargo against Cuba)
 hamen reportein mil rahi hai ki vishwa arthvyavastha ko 1,000 arab dollar kii teji mil jaaegi, or bharat main yah baat dhadlle se tote kii tarah rati ja rahi he
 All such numbers should be viewed with suspicion
 pehali baat, ham abhi gaiyr-krishi vastuon, krishi or sevaaon main udaarikaran kii maatra ko nahin jaan rahe hai
 Secondly, are they income related, welfare benefits or export benefits? For example, if full liberalization of agriculture is done, consumers in developed countries will pay less
 tisare, aisi hi un sankhyaon kaa kya hua jo urugve chakra ke samay main uchhaali gai thim?us samay kii sankhyaayein hakeekat main nahin badalin kyonki udaarikaran kii bhaavana ko kanoon main maujuud khaamiyon ke sahare nahin mana gaya
 So it is not right to get excited immediately
 baatcheet main is haath de us haath le hota he
 To get something, you have to give something
 hamane kisaanon ko sabsidi par suraksha pai
 In the process, are we going to lighten our demand to reduce agricultural support in developed countries? Plutarch wrote, "it is said, Pyrus replied that one victory brought happiness, but one more victory was complete happiness
" Will finish with ” kasablanka kii tarah bhartiya mantri bhi isse pehle jalte jahaaj par khadey rahe hai
 It is established that there can be no global trade agreement without taking India along
 yah 1992 ke blair house ecord kii tulana main swaagatyogy badlaav he, jab viksit deshon ne faisla kiya or baaki logon ke gale main jabaran utaar diya
 For this, we will have to wait for the specifics to emerge
 phir baat aati he vyapaar suvidha sarleekaran (trade facilitation) kii, jo 1996 kii singapore conference ke tathakthith ahm masalon main se ek tha
 India and South America have explicitly accepted trade facilitation facilitation as part of the agenda as efforts have been made to address their concerns
 sarleekaran ke samjhaute acchhee baat hai or ve singapore conference ke anya masalon kii tarah nahin hai
 As such, there was no serious need to oppose its inclusion
 vah 1,000 arab dollar kaa aankada keval vyapaar suvidha sarleekaran ke laabh ko dikhaa rahaa he
 But once the agreement comes into force, India will also have to pay its price and some parts of the government will have to be reformed accordingly
 aisa karne kii jarurat hogi or bahari samjhauta ek utprerak ke taur par bhi kaam karata he, lekin yah bina keemat or bina vivaad ke sambhav nahin hoga
 This is a different view of the entire WTO agreement
 iskaa sambandh udaarikaran se he, haalanki yah adhuraa he or isse un logon ko phayda hoga jo sakasham hai or jo aapurti sambandhi samasyaon se nahin jujh rahe
 As such, we will find a catalyst for long-delayed reforms (including agriculture)

 unhone bataaya ki jab vah film 'gabaru' kii shooting kar raheen thi, tab set par maaya yadav ne unhen kaha ki film 'kaajal' ke mekar mujhe lekar ek gaanaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Then there was talk on the makers of 'kajal' and i am in this song
 unhone kaha ki film main kaajal yadav kaa kirdaar bahut pyaara hai
 This film should be a milestone for him and he will go far ahead
 is film main bhojpuri kii yuva dilon kii dhadkan kaajal raghavani ne bhi ek number song kiya he, jisko lekar amrapali dube (amrapali Dubey) ne kaha ki acchhee script par phase vailu asar karti he, kyonki kai baar acchhee filmein banati he, lekin poster par bina koi bada phase dekhe log film se duuri bana lete hai
 In such a situation, Kajal and my entry will further the success of this film

 india today conklev main congress saansad shashi tharur or bijepi netaa vinay sahasrabuddhe ke saath hindu dharm or hindutv ke mudde par charchaa hui
 Tharoor said that Hinduism is a very big religion and it has many kinds of beliefs
 lekin jab aap iske sametakar raajnneetik pahchaan ke rup main paribhaashit karne lage jaaen tab yah hindutv kehalaata he
 He said that Veer Savarkar had defined Hinduism as a race more than a religion
 dharm main shaayad unki utani gahari aasthaa nahin rahi he lekin unhone ise ek rashtravaadi takat kaa pratik bataaya tha
 Tharoor said that for me Hinduism is a belief which gives freedom to think with open heart
 mul rup se hamen sabhi kii dharanaon ko sweekaar karnaa sikhaata he
 Hinduism says to accept more than tolerance
 kyonki sahishnutaa ek saraparasti kaa vichaar he jabaki sweekaarta sabhi ko ek-duusare ke vishwaas ko sammaan dene kii baat kahati he
 But Hindutva justifies its own truth
 hindutv kii galat vyakhya huibijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh vinay sahasrabuddhe ne hindu banaam hindutv par apane vichaar rakhte hue kaha ki mere liye hindutv kaa matlab aadhyatmik loktantr se he
 In Hinduism, we believe in one truth, but in Hinduism, diversity has its place
 hindutv kii kai log jaanboojhkar galat vyakhya karte hai
 Hindutva is Ekam Sat Vipra: Often Vadani
 iskaa matlab he ki satya ek he lekin budhimaan ise kai naamon se bulaate hai

 Fruit peels are found in high amounts of nutrients
 agar aap falon ke in chhilkon ko bhi khaanaa shuru kar den to aapako milane vaala phayda doguna ho jayega
 Apples, cucumbers and oranges are some of the fruits whose peels are used to improve a healthy heart and immune system
 haalanki kuch falon ke chhilake aise bhi hote hai jo kaaphi sakht hote hai or unhen pachaa paanaa kaaphi mushkil hota he
 In such a situation, it is advisable to use them in some other way
 yahaan kuch aise hi falon kaa zikr he jinka chhilka khaanaa swasthya ke liye bahut phydemand hota he:1
 Orange peel contains a lot of nutrients in its peel
 agar aap santare kaa chhilka kha pate hai to isse dil se judi kai bimariyon se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Also it is very effective in removing the smell of Yamunh and keeping the teeth healthy
 kabj kii samasya main bhi ye kaaphi phydemand he
 It is a little difficult to eat orange peel directly
 aap chahen to iske chhilake ko sukhaakar churna banaakar istemaal kar sakate hai
 2
 anaar kaa chhilakaagale kii kharash dur karne ke liye anaar kaa chhilka bahut hi kargar upaay he
 Also, it is also very beneficial in removing the problem of gums
 isamen bhi aayran kii bharpoor maatra hoti he, jo swasthya ke liye bahut hi jaruri tatv he
 3
 kele kaa chhilakakele kaa chhilka bahut adhik phydemand hota he
 You might be surprised to know this, but banana peel has more fiber than the original fruit
 kele ke chhilake main amino acid kii paryaapt maatra hoti he
 If you have any problem related to eye infection then eating banana peel will be very beneficial
 4
 You know the peel of watermelon
 Eating watermelon quickly reduces weight
 haalanki iske chhilake ko usee rup main kha paanaa thodaa mushkil hota he lekin agar aap ise khire kii tarah tukade kar-karke khaaenge to ye aaraam se khaaya ja sakegaa
 5
 khire kaa chhilakakhire ke chhilake main vitamin e or ke bharpoor maatra main paaya jaataa he
 These two vitamins are very good for health and are also effective in weight loss
 haddiyon kii majbootee ke liye bhi ye bahut hi phydemand he
 6
 seb kaa chhilakashayad aapako pataa na ho lekin seb ke mukhya poshak tatv uske chhilake main hi maujuud hote hai
 Flavonoids-rich apple peel not only increases immunity, but also protects against cancer

 @amitshahheartiest congratulations to Shri Amit Shah on his reelection as BJP National President
 He has been an extremely successful party president i am confident that BJP will continue its forward march under Shri Amit Shah's stewardship and reach to newer heights of success and glory saurav ganguli ne bhartiya captain viraat kohli ko mahaj teen second main kolkata main bangladesh ke khilaaf gulabi gend se test khilne ke liye jarur manaa liya hoga, lekin nae board adhyaksh ke liye bhavishya main bhartiya team prabandhan ko phir se 'pink test' khilne ke liye samajhaana aasaan nahin hoga
 Indian team sources said that seeing the pink ball in the floodlight was one of the main challenges that he faced in the Kolkata Test
 aisi sambhaavna he kibhartiya team bhavishya main videshi daure ke dauraan gulabi gend se test khilne ke kadamon kaa virodh karegi
 If the BCCI takes the response of the team, then the players will talk about playing with the regular red ball, not the pink
 bhartiya team kolkata de-nite test se pehle hi gulabi gend ko lekar chintit thi
 She also came out on the field with an open mind to play the Pink Ball Test
 ab mana ja kaha he ki de-nite test kaa anubhav hasil karne ke baad bhartiya khilaadi bhavishya main din-raat kaa test khilne ke mood main nahin hai
 'visibility issue, besides the ball was also tough
 
 
 'bhartiya team prabandhan ke ek sadsy ne indian express se bataaya, 'hamen laga ki gend ek mudda he
 Apart from visibility, the ball was also very strict
 dekhie bangladesh ke ballebaaj ko kaise chot lagi
 It was a challenge to see the ball even during fielding
 aise gendbaaj jo 140 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se gend daal sakate hai, unke liye is gend ko sanbhaalanaa aasaan nahin tha
 This ball originates faster than the regular red ball
 eemaandaaree se kahen, to dudhia roshni main gulabi gend ko bhaanpana kathin tha
 'heavy pink ball was also an issue in the Bangladesh camp
 indore main gulabi gend se prashikshan le rahe kuch khilaadiyon ne is bare main baat kii thi
 Now after the Kolkata Test, an Indian player also agreed with this assessment
 usne bhi kaha, 'haa yah bahut baari he, hockey ball kii tarah
 It would be silly if we play ahead with pink ball in future
 ' ullekhneey he ki khud captain kohli ne kaha tha ki pink ball kaaphi teji se fielder ke haath main lagati he
 It is exactly like a heavy hockey ball

 Even in search of their roots or living in the city, they are not able to get rid of their village, its soil and its smell

 Parallel to these, the characters of the two stories and their surroundings are undoubtedly urban, but their main characters are living in a panic

 It is heartening to see that despite living in Delhi for so many years and settling here, Gaurinath has not forgotten the smell of his village, home and his soil

 Congressmen themselves believe that the decisions taken by the Congress high command regarding Uttarakhand are responsible for these situations
 satpal maharaj ke yun achaanak bhaajapa kaa daaman tham lene ke baad uttarakhand main rajnatik sargharmiyaan tej ho gayi hai
 Satpal Maharaj and his supporters have been feeling disrespected in the Congress for a long time
 congress ne kai aise kaam kiye jisase satpal maharaj ko samarthakon ke bich apmaan kaa ghunt pinaa padaa
 First the party indicated Satpal Maharaj to be the state president, Maharaj also accepted congratulations
 lekin alaakaman ne apane kadam peeche khinch liye
 The Congress Alaar Command had done the right thing by handing over the reins of Uttarakhand to Harish Rawat, the arch-rival of Maharaj
 jis din ravat ko rajya ki kaman saunpane kaa dilli main nirnay hua usee din rajya main congress nit sarkaar kii ulti ginati shuru ho gayi thi, jisaki parinti satpal mahraaj kii congress se rukhsati ke rup main hui
 BJP leader Satpal Maharaj of Uttarakhand is very happy with this move, he is considering Maharaj's arrival in BJP as his own strength
 satpal maharaj ke samarthan main aadha darjan se zyada vidhayak hai jiske chalate sabaki nigahen maharaj ki patni amrutha ravat or unke samarthak vidhayakon par tiki he kyonki yadi inhone mahraaj kaa anusaran kiya to harish ravat sarkaar ki vidaai tay he
 Uttarakhand Congressmen are shocked by Satpal Maharaj's joining BJP
 ve in halaat ke liye congress aalaa kaman ki nitiyo ko jimmedaar maanate hai jinhone satpal maharaj jaise kaddavar netaaon kii naa keval andekhi kii balki aise nirnay bhi liye jisase congress kaa paryaay ban gaye netaaon ne khud ko apamaanit mahasoos kiya
 At the same time, when he talked to senior BJP leader Khanduri, he also said that if the party has taken any decision then it will be correct

 'marane vaale to ek din bina bataae mar jate hai, roj to wo marate hai, jo khud se zyada kisi ko chaahate hai
 'sneha Kumari, who put this status on Facebook, is no longer in this world
 sneha koi aam ladkee nahi thi
 She was posted as a constable in Bihar Police
 lekin uski maut ho jaati he or vibhaag ko do din baad uskaa pataa chalata he
 The father says that my daughter was beautiful and this is also the reason for her death
 jis tarah ke aarope sneha ke parivaar vaale laga rahe hai usase nishchit rup se police kii bhoomika par shaq paidaa hota he
 However, the postmortem report of Sneha has not been revealed yet
 postmortem report ke baad hi is maamle se jude or khulaase ho sakate hai
 The role of the police in this entire episode is questionable
 sneha usee bihar police kaa hissaa he, jo is maamle ko sandigdh banane main lagi he
 But why
 sawaal yah he ki kisko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Sneha Kumari was posted in Siwan district but she is found dead in her official quarter on 1 June
 lekin body kii sthiti dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa tha ki uski maut 48 ghante pehle hui hogi
 Accordingly, the murder took place on 30 May
 aakhir do dinon tak sneha ke bare main kisi ne khoj khabar kyon nahin lee
 Police termed her death as suicide
 jis sandigdh tareeke se is maamle ko chhipaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he usase shaq lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he ki aakhir puri kii puri police kisko bachaane main lagi he
 File photo- After Sneha Kumari'sneha's death, the police informed her father that her health has deteriorated, so come to Siwan immediately
 jab pita munger se siwan pahunchate hai to kaha gaya ki sneha ko patna bhej diya gaya he
 The two policemen leave for Patna with their father and are taken straight to Munger
 jabaki sharir kharaab hone kii vajah se siwan ke doctoron ne postmortem se inkaar kar diya tha
 After which the police beat him up because of which the doctors went on strike
 baad main postmart ke liye sneha ke shav ko piemasiech patna bheja gaya
 But there was a twist in Sneha's death when the body reached her native place in Munger
 parivaar waalon ne shav ko pahachaane se inkaar kar diya or jamkar hangaamaa karte hue haive jam kar diya
 Police vigorously detained 10 family members and forcibly cremated Sneha
 yahaan tak police khud shav lekar shmashaan ghat pahunchi
 Family members have also accused Sneha of rape
 sneha ke pita vivekanand mandal kaa kahana he ki unki beti kii jaan uski sundarataa ne le lee
 This statement of a helpless father is telling everything in itself
 yah sambhav ho saktaa he ki is puure maamle main police vibhaag kaa hi koi taqatwar he, jise bachaane ke liye siwan or munger donon jagahon kii police lagi he
 Sneha's death is traced on 1 June and relatives are entrusted to cremate on 4 June
 file photo- sneha kumariakhir itnaa vakt kyon laga police ko shav saupane main? ye police kii laaparvaahee nahin to or kya he
 Sivan's SP Naveen Jha says that only after the postmortem report comes, something can be said on the family's allegations
 vahiin munger ke espi kaa kahana he ki sneha ke shav nahin hone kii baat saamne ai he, isliye uskaa body sample lekar diene test ke liye bheja gaya he
 The body has been handed over to the family for the last rites
 bihar police main mahilaon ko 33 pratishat aarakshan mila he
 Therefore, women get a good job opportunity in Bihar Police but on the contrary there are some reports of exploitation
 lekin sneha ke saath kya hua uskaa pataa postmortem report se hi chal paaegaa
 Britain elected its new Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July 2019, but only 1 month later Boris Johnson himself proposed a re-election to Parliament
 july se pehle 24 may, 2019 ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri terresa me (theresa May) ne bhi baar-baar bracit (brexit) main naakaam hone ke baad apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 That is, the case of Brexit in UK politics is so big that it also leads to the post of Prime Minister and recently the post of UK PM Boris Johnson is also in danger due to this reason
 yahaan aapako isi bracit ke bare main bataa rahe hai ki aakhir kaise ye mudda baar-baar sarkaar girane kaa kaaran ban rahaa he
 Britain's PM said 'letterbox' to women wearing burqa, Sikh MP gave a befitting reply
 
 
 dekhen videoyuena ko aarthik mandi kaa kaaran maanate hue vajah bataai gai ki britain ko har saal european union ke bajet ke liye 9 arab dollar dene hote hai
 Because of the UN, people settle in the UK without hindrance
 iske saath hi free vija policy se britain ko baari nuksaan ho rahaa he
 But on the contrary, many people in Britain are aware of the benefits being made to the UN and call the decision of Britain to separate from the UN wrong
 jaise britain kii conservative party or us party ke david camran (david Cameron), jo saal 2010 se 2016 tak britain ke pradhanmantri rahe
 Are opposed to Brexit
 kyonki bracit kaa virodh kar rahe logon ko maaloom he ki isse duusare europea deshon se karobar par bura asar hoga
 Britain's single market system will end and Britain's GDP will suffer
 vahiin, david camran ke baad bane donon piem (terresa me or boris johnson) ne bracit ko apana mudda banaaya or ise lagu karne kii shart par pradhanmantri kaa padbar sambhala
 But of these, Teresa failed to win a majority on Brexit and had to resign
 vahiin ab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri boris johnson kii sarkaar bhi khatre main he

 ' Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa, who assumed power for the sixth time in 2016, lost her life to death
 jayraman jayalalita ne utaar-chadhaav se bhare apane kariyar main kai ladaaiyaan ladi or jeetin
 Known for his determination to stand back each time and fight his personal and political propagandists, Jayalalithaa was born on 24 February 1948 in Mysore, Karnataka, to a Brahmin family
 sivi shridhar ke nirdesan main saal 1956 main bani film vennira adai se cinema jagat main padaarpan karne vaali jayalalita ne ek kishor abhinetri se ek lokapriy or charchit abhinetri banane tak kaa safar tay kiya
 After her entry into films through her mother, her pairing with the then popular actor MG Ramachandran became famous
 1965 se 1972 tak unhone adhikanshtah filmein mjiaar ke saath kin
 But after this he did not have a filmy relationship with MGR for the next 10 years because he went into politics and became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 1977
 1980 main tamilnadu main chaar maheene ke liye raashtrapati shashan laga or phir chunaav hue
 MGR once again became the Chief Minister and during this second period of Chief Ministership, MGR brought Jayalalithaa into politics, although Jayalalithaa always denied it
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki jayalalita ke raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat diemke party se hui jise aaj jayalalita ne tamilnadu main haashie par laa khadaa kiya he
 After doing more than 300 films including Tamil Telugu, Kannada and a Hindi film, Jayalalithaa was brought to the Rajya Sabha by MGR
 mjiaar jayalalita kii english ke bhi behad kaayal the or rajyasabha main unhen bhejne ke peeche bhi yahi kaaran tha
 Jaya remained in the Rajya Sabha from 1984-89
 is dauraan unhen party kaa prachaar sachiv bhi niyukt kiya gaya
 When MGR died in 1987, his party split into two factions
 jayalalita mjiaar ke dhade kii leader baniin or unhone khud ke mjiaar ke viraasat kaa uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya
 After this, his political career which started now ended with his death after 29 years
 is dauraan wo chah baar tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri raheen
 In 1991, he aligned with the Congress and the sympathy wave created by Rajiv Gandhi's assassination helped his party win a landslide victory
 iske saath hi jayalalita ne pehali baar 1991 main mukhyamantri kaa pad sambhala
 Jayalalithaa not only holds the record for being the first woman Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu but she also became the youngest Chief Minister of this state
 haalanki isi daur main unki apni nikat mitra shashikala ke parivaar ke saath takaraav shuru ho gaya
 The family was allegedly interfering on every front of the government
 jayalalita ke dattak putr ve
 N
 sudhakaran kii shaadi main saarvajanik taur par jis shaan-o-shaukat kaa pradarshan kiya gaya, uski bhi baari aalochana hui
 In the backdrop of allegations of corruption in 1996, the Jayalalithaa-led party was defeated by the DMK-TMC alliance
 is gathbandhan ko tamil superstar rajnikant kaa samarthan praapt tha
 Jayalalithaa was then arrested and several cases were registered against her, including a disproportionate assets case
 chunavi nuksaan se vichlit hue bina, jayalalita ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath gathbandhan kar liya lekin baad main unhone apane rajnatik kad ko rashtriya falak tak le jate hue vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ko saal 1999 main gira diya
 Year 1991
 
 
 96, 2001
 
 
 Jayalalithaa, who was the chief minister from 2006 and May 2011 to September 2014, was also discussed for her tough decisions during this period
 saal 2001 main jayalalita ek baar phir apni party ko satta main lekar ain or is dauraan jab sarkari karmchaariyon ne hadtaal kii to jayalalita ne aitihaasik kadam uthaate hue lagbhag do lakh karmchaariyon ko barkhaast kar diya
 Due to this, the entire Tamil Nadu rose
 isi saal tieenesai bhoomi maamle main doshi sabit hone ke kaaran kuch samay ke liye unhen mukhyamantri kaa pad chhodana padaa lekin iskaa asar unhone party ke bhagya par nahin padane diya
 Then they paneerselvam ko apane sthaan par tainaat kar diya tha
 It was only after he was proved innocent in the case that he took back the reins of the government from Panneerselvam
 aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main unhen pehle doshi or phir bari kiya gaya
 The disproportionate assets case threatened to shatter his political career but the Comeback Queen made his comeback at a time when his party was preparing for the 2016 assembly elections
 jayalalita kii vaapasi ne vipakshiyon kii ranneeti main ek nayaa hi pench laa diya
 When the AIADMK chief was convicted in a disproportionate assets case in September 2014, she was automatically disqualified due to a central law
 jayalalita ne iskaa saamana kanoonee taur par karne kaa sankalp jataayaa tha
 He took the oath of Chief Minister for the fifth time within 15 days of his acquittal in the case
 puratchi thalivi (krantikari netaa) kahalaane vaali jayalalita ne dramuk kii un sabhi gananaaon ko galat sabit kar diya tha, jinke anusaar, dramuk ko saal 2011 main satta hasil hone vaali thi
 That year Jayalalithaa led her party to a landslide victory by tying up with the DMDK and the Left parties
 em karunanidhi ke netritv vaali diemke ko mahaj 23 vidhayak hi mil paae the

 In Chhattisgarh, in spite of crores of saplings being planted every year, forests in Chhattisgarh have reduced in 15 years
 chhattisgarh main beete 15 saalon main jangal badhane ke bajaae ghat gaye
 While more than 500 crores is spent in plantations during the annual rainy season
 har saal van vibhaag daawa karata he ki wo ek karod se zyada paudhe laga rahaa he
 But where these plants are growing remains a mystery
 rajya ke hai court ne bhi notice jari kar van vibhaag se poocha he ki aakhir paudhe lag kahaan rahe he
 And it seems that why the area of the forest has decreased
 darasal vriksharopan hone ke baavjood varsh 2001 se 2015 tak lagbhag 3700 varg kimi jangal kam ho gaya he
 This has been revealed in the government report
 maamle kii jaanch ko lekar hai court kaa notice jari hone ke baad van vibhaag ke aalaa afasar bagale jhaank rahe he
 Actually, in 8-10 years in the state, only plantation was done on paper
 or us par kharch hui rakam afasaron kii tijori main chali gai
 According to RTI activists, the officials committed more than 15 hundred crores in the name of planting saplings
 yun tochhattisgarhmen har saal skulon se lekar jangalon tak paryaavaran diwas jorshor se manaaya jaataa he
 Plantation program is also done in presence of VIP
 chand paudhon kaa ropan karne ke baad van vibhaag aankade jari karata he ki usne barish ke chaar maah main ek karod se zyada paudhe lagaae
 This plant planting target is fixed
 ye paudhe shahari ilaakon se lekar gramin ilaakon tak lagaae jate hai
 Apart from this, the forest department pats itself on the back by claiming to plant saplings in the forests
 rajya main 2001 se lekar 2015 tak kabhi harihar chhattisgarh yojana to kabhi mukhyamantri baadi bans yojana to kabhi oxigen jone ke naam par karodon paudhon kaa ropan bataaya gaya
 In these years, the Forest Department spent crores of rupees in the name of planting trees, but those plants neither appeared in the forests nor in open settlements away from the population
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir ye paudhe kahaan gaye?rajya main bade paimaane par paudha ropan ke naam par janata kii gadhi kamai hathiyaane ke aarope van vibhaag par lag rahe hai
 RTI activists have submitted full evidence of the scam to the Chhattisgarh High Court
 is par hai court ne teen hafte ke bheetar van vibhaag se paudha ropan kaa puraa byoraa maanga he
 According to RTI activist Rakesh Chaubey, there is a big scam in the state in the name of Harrier Chhattisgarh
 isamen van vibhaag ke aalaa adhikari or mantri tak shaamil hai
 According to him, all the documents received from the RTI were examined by the High Court
 phir van vibhaag ko notice jari kar plantesan kaa puraa byoraa maanga he
 He demanded a CBI inquiry into the case
 udhar rajya ke van mantri mahesh gagada ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki bade paimaane par jangalon kaa rakabaa gata he
 He has given instructions to constitute a team of Forest Department to investigate this
 harihar chhattisgarh 2017 ke tahat 8 karod 2 lakh paudhe lagaae gaye hai
 In 2016, 7 crore 60 lakh saplings were planted
 or 2015 main 10 karod paudhe lagaae gaye the
 Despite the continuous tree planting after the construction of Chhattisgarh, about 3700 sq km of forest has been reduced from the year 2001 to 2015
 ab logon kii nigahen van vibhaag ke jawaab par tiki hui he
 According to scientists, pits should be dug for plantation in summer
 vrikshon kii dekharekh 3 varshon tak honi chahie
 In 2013, the Forest Department had instructed that the plantation work should be completed by 20 July under any circumstances
 barsaat yaa visham paristhitiyon ho to 31 july tak vriksharopan kiya ja saktaa he, lekin uske liye mukhyalay se anumati leni hogi
 But the Forest Department never gave any information following these instructions
 na to garmiyon main paudha ropan ke liye gadde khode or naa hi barish ke mausam main
 The pits were dug at the places where vips and public representatives had to plant saplings
