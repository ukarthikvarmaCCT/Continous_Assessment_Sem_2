 '' a sensational case of murder has come to light in the city of Rajkot, Gujarat
 jahaan pyaar main pagal ek premi ne hi kisi baat se khafa hokar apni premika ko berahami ke saath maut ke ghat utaar diya
 The accused lover publicly stabbed his girlfriend 18 times, one after the other with a sharp knife
 hatya kii yah dil dahala dene vaali vaardaat rajkot ke nateshwar mandir ke paas ek garden main hui
 Actually, there was a love affair between Bhavesh Heerji and Amreli resident young lady Bhavika
 aksar donon chhipachhip kar mila karte the
 On Wednesday too, both of them reached to meet at the garden near Nateswara temple towards Sorathia Bari
 shaam kaa vakt tha
 Both Bhavesh and Bhavika were sitting there for quite a while
 sabakuch thik tha
 Suddenly, Bhavesh got angry about something and fired a sharp knife and stabbed his girlfriend Bhavika
 aaropee ne bhavika par kul milakar 18 waar kiye
 Bhavika fell there, bled
 or usne mauka-e-vaardaat par hi dam tod diya
 People nearby were shocked to see this scene
 hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam dekar aaropee maukey se bhaagane laga
 The people there immediately informed the police about this wick
 soochna milte hi police harakat main aa gai or kuch der main hi aaropee bhavesh ko police ne giraftaar kar liya
 This sensational incident of murder was also captured in a CCTV camera
 maukey par maujuud logon ne police ko bataaya ki garden main baithe ek yuvak ne achaanak uske saath baithi yuvati par chaaku se hamalaa kar diya
 Police have taken the body of the woman and sent it for postmortem
 is sambandh main hatya kaa maamla darj kar aage kii karrwai kii ja rahi he
 The accused was produced in the court by the police from where he has been sent to jail
 jab beti ne apane saare gamon ko ‘drudh ichchhashakti’ main badalakar jivan main satat sangharsh karne kaa haunsala dikhaaya to phir mata-pita kaise peeche rahete
 She too held up her daughter firmly and the widow of Bareilly, a small town in Uttar Pradesh, has become a silver lining for many women in the country today with the new and inspiring identity of Lieutenant Ruchi Verma
 jab naam ke aage ‘rank’ lagi to sab kuch badal gaya- pehle kapade, phir bal or baad main sabase jaruri ek nai pahchaan mili
 Now it is part of the world's second largest army
 sari kii jagah hari faujee vardi ne lee he
 Ruchi herself says that a huge responsibility has fallen on her shoulders
 pehle bas apane chote bachche kii jimmedaari thi
 Now he has to live up to the trust of the people of the country
 30 april 2013 tak uski bas itani hi pahchaan thi ki wo sena main major vineet verma kii patni he
 At that time, handling children in the name of work, cooking, partying and celebrating all the year-long festivals with them when the husband came home on holidays
 kuch aisi hi dincharya thi ruchi kii
 But on April 30, 2013, there was such a shock in life that everything came to a standstill with the pace of life
 jab ye pataa chalaa ki assam main ek ugravad virdohi abhiyaan main ladate hue major vineet shahid ho gaye
 It seemed that the whole world was destroyed
 ruchi ke liye to jindagi kaa ek-ek pal kaatna mushkil ho gaya
 How will she find her youngest son Akshat? Will the son now be able to get the upbringing she would have received during her husband's life? The husband had dreamed about Akshat, now all of them were wired
 isi bich, ghanghor andhere main ek ummid kii kiran najar ai ki agar wo khud fouj main chali jaae to na keval apane pati ke adhure sapane ko puraa kar sakati he balki apane bete kii parvarish bhi sena ke maahaul main kar sakegi
 The people of Major Vineet's unit and his parents came forward to help
 samajha ja saktaa he kaise ruchi ke pita ne apni beti ke sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye apane dar par kaabo paada hoga
 Ruchi's father Sudhir Saxena says that all i wanted at that time was to get over the shock it had caused
 maine or or meri patni ne bas ruchi kii himmat badhaai
 It is important to mention here that Saxena Saheb himself has graduated in Military Science
 mauka milane par sena se judi har baat padhate hai
 Wished to send the son to the army, but he could not succeed
 phir jab ruchi kii shaadi ke liye major vineet kaa prastaav aayaa to jaise unhen laga maano man kii muraad puri ho gai
 Both the family's interest and Major Vineet were married on 2 April 2006
 ruchi ko to duniya kii sari khushiyaan hi mil gai
 My husband went wherever he was posted
 sena ko bakhubi janaa lekin jab ‘line of control’ par pati kii posting hui to wo dilli main rahane lagi
 Meanwhile, when the son Akshat came into the life of both of them in 2009, there was more happiness in happiness
 bete ko lekar donon miyaan bivi sochate ise sherwood jaise nami skool main bhenjege
 But who knew that one day it would come that all happiness would be eclipsed
 khayr, kismat ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 Five months after Major Vineet's martyrdom, Ruchi filled the form to become an officer in the army and also passed the SSB examination to become an officer in January last year
 lekin ye sab itnaa aasaan nahin tha kyonki ab tak aaraam kii zindagi jeene vaali ruchi ke liye sainya prashikshan kisi badi chunauti se kam nahin tha or sabase bada sawaal to yah tha ki nanha akshat kiske saath rahegaa
 In such a situation, the parents of interest took full responsibility of Akshat
 11 maheene kii kadi training lene ke liye ruchi sena kii chennai sthit afasar training academy gai
 Interest says, 'I did not go there as a martyred officer's wife but went as a trainee cadet, so if i get scolded and punished for making a mistake, well done
 bahut kuch siikhaa vahaan par
 Earlier i used to start crying about Vineet and now i can talk about my husband with confidence
 itnaa hausala aa gaya he ki akele apane dam par bete ko paal luungi
 ' training ke baad, pehle kii tulana main ruchi ab sena ko kahi zyada behatar dhang se samajhane lagi he
 Today she is more proud of her husband
 ve kahati he, 'aam logon kaa kaise jaraa si oonchai par chadhane main hi dam phool jaataa he or vahiin major vineet jaise sena ke jabanj hajaaron feet kii oonchai par apni dauty nibhaate hai
 Out of the seven years of her marriage, her interest in spending just two years with her husband is a testament to the fact that she got very little time with her husband because most of the time her husband's field postings were there but he joined the army Through this, she has also understood the strength of Major Vineet, for whom the country was before the family
 leftinent ruchi kahati he, 'pehle main beshak apane pati ke sapane ko puraa karne ke liye fouj main ai thi lekin jab kandhe par sitara laga to ab mahasoos hota he ki jimmedaari or bad gai he
 After that, when i took the oath, i first thought of coming into the army for son and Vineet, but now the responsibility of the country has come, the hopes of millions of people have joined us and to live up to it like every soldier of mine
 Has become the goal
 agar ham jaise yuva desh ke bare main aisa nahin sochenge to koun sochega?' beti ke hausale or bahaduree ko dekhakar pita sudhir ko kaaphi garv he
 Ruchi says, what he will become when his son Akshat grows up, he will decide for himself, but no one will be more happy than if he goes into the army
 ruchi kahati he ki jindagi main aps and down(utaar-chadhaav) to aate hi rahete hai, lekin jindagi vahiin khatm nahin hoti
 You have to decide whether you should live as a winner or as a loser
 mujhe to ‘bechaari’ banakar nahin jeena tha isliye maine ye rasta chunaa

 On April 4, India will become the sixth country in the world to have its own nuclear-powered submarine
 bhartiya nausena main ienes chakra kaa shaamil hona hind mahaasaagar main uski takat ko bade paimaane par badhayega
 INS Chakra is a Russian-built Akula-2 class offensive submarine (SSN)
 hind mahaasaagar main chini nausena ke pravesh kaa jawaab dene ke liye bhartiya nausena ke paas ab yah iklauti sabase badi takat hogi
 The five-week journey of this submarine bringing one hundred personnel from Vladivostok, Russia, five thousand kilometers away, is about to end
 yah vishakhapatnam main aakar rukegi or yaheen ise tainaat kiya jayega
 Its route was kept confidential and it is reaching here through the sea level of Japan, China, Philippines and Indonesia
 yahi isaki takat or tikaoo kshamta kaa pehla pradarshan he
 Strategic affairs specialist Rear Admiral (retd) Raja Menon says, "chakra is equipped with technology that definitely tilts the balance of power in our favor, but unfortunately we need eight such submarines while We are getting only one
 ’is pandubbi main ek parmaanu riector laga hua he jisase ise jabardast urja praapt hoti he
 But it is not used to carry nuclear weapons
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae to yah bhartiya nausena ke liye parmaanu nishedh ke kaam main nahin aane vaali
 To overcome this deficiency, it is necessary to have a submarine which can be used to transport ballistic missiles with nuclear weapons
 desh main hi nirmit 6,000 ton kii arihant shrenee vaali nabhikeey sheershayukt belistic missile pandubbi (esasbn) is kaary main sakasham he, lekin ise abhi nausena ko saunpe jane main do varsh kaa samay lagegaa kyonki yah abhi pareekshan ke charan main he
 According to Professor Brahma Chelani at the Center for Policy Research, New Delhi, "with the arrival of the cycle, the Indian Navy will have the practice of operating a nuclear powered submarine so that it can prepare to operate the SSBN
" ’chakra kaa buniyadi kaam esasbn ke liye carmikon ko prashikshit karnaa he

 According to military analysts, it is a collision with the old Los Angeles-class submarines of the US Navy

 In the early nineties, the submarine stood in the shipyard of komsomosk-on-amur in Far Eastern Russia under the name 'nerpa'
 roosi nausena ke bikharane ke baad se hi iskaa kaam rukaa padaa tha
 In 2004 India under a confidential agreement to complete its construction work 6

 The people working on the submarine were given 18 months of training in 2005 in St
 Petersburg
 pandubbi ko dekhne ke liye unhen agle chah saal tak intjaar karnaa padaa
 It was to be introduced only in 2008, but was delayed for several reasons
 is bich ek haadasa bhi hua jab 2008 main japan sagar main iske pareekshan ke dauraan durghatanavash hue gas utsarjan main 20 roosi jahajakarmi maare gaye the
 The delay also led to several reversals, one of which resulted in Chakra's commanding officer, P

 In an emergency, all 100 shipmen can enter and roll on the surface
 chakra kareeb 12,000 ton pani kii jagah gherti he jo nausena kii 2,300 ton vaali paaramparik pandubbiyon ke mukaable kareeb teen guna he
 Ship personnel in its fleet say they are surprised to see its size
 ek karmi ne bataaya, ‘yah adwitiya he
 It is like riding on a huge ship

 'instead of crawling like the rest of the submarines, it can stand upright and move
 iske bade aakaar ke chalate karmiyon ko kaaphi aaraam rahegaa
 Traditional submarines only have bunk (sleeping space) for half the ship personnel, bunk for everyone in the cycle

 mantrimandal ke sadasyon se lekar party ke bheetar tak rassakashi se sandesh galat ja rahaa he
 The first two ministers Satpal Maharaj and Harak Singh Rawat made headlines in a cabinet meeting in front of the Chief Minister, then there was a scuffle between supporters of Satpal Maharaj and Madan Kaushik in Haridwar and Mayor Manoj Garg reached the hospital and the government and the BJP were shaky happened
 vibhaagon ke bantwaare par mantriyon main asantosh ko lekar pehle hi charchaaon kaa bazaar garm tha
 Although the unhappiness of the ministers could not come to the surface then, some people inside did not hesitate to express their displeasure
 iske baad kaddavar netaa or paryaton mantri satpal maharaj kuch cabinet baithkon se anupasthit rahe
 The reason for this, despite being the Minister of Tourism and Pilgrimage, was not to be called at the time of departure of buses for the Chardham Yatra and that his adversary younger brother was to be called for it
 iske alaava parvatiy kshetra ke ek daure main unke helicopter kaa unhen vahiin chhodkar waapas aa janaa bhi unki naaraazgi ke kaarnon me shaamil tha
 He also complained to the Chief Minister about this
 iske baad maharaj or van mantri harak singh ravat kii mantrimandal kii baithak main hi kedarnath main praadhikaran ke maamle me ek-duusare ke saath bhidnt ho gai
 Harak Singh pointed out the authority which Maharaj was referring to as important
 had tab ho gai jab haridwar main maharaj or mantri madan kowshik ke samarthakon main jamkar lathi-danda chale
 Political analysts see this as increasing distance between ministers
 in tamaam ghatnaon se ab bhaajapa main bhi bhitarghaat kaa andeshaa netaaon ko sataane laga he
 Vijay Bahuguna's meeting with Ajay Bhatt, who joined the Congress before the elections, confirmed political speculation

 bahuguna apane putr or sitarganj se vidhayak saurabh bahuguna ke saath ajay bhatta ke nivas par pahunche the or aadhe ghante vahiin rahe
 After this Bahuguna also met Harak Singh
 is mulaakaat main bahuguna ne congress se bhaajapa main aae netaaon kii upeksha par charchaa kii
 However, Bhatt denied that Bahuguna was trying to get his son a minister
 harak singh bhi cabinet baithak main anupasthit rahane ke peeche naaraazgi se inkaar karte hai
 He expressed his displeasure at not sending a doctor despite saying at the hospital in Kotdwar
 pichley dinon haridwar jile main tirangaa yatra ke dauraan jile ke khanpur main haridwar ke saansad nishank or congress se baghawat kar bhaajapa main gaye or khanpur se vidhayak bane kunwar pranav champion samarthakon ke bich ladaai ke maamle ko bhi jile ke bhaajapa kaaryaktaaon kii gutbaji ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 unke saath haridwar gramin ke vidhayak yatishwaranand or jwalapur ke vidhayak suresh rathore ne bhi is maamle main pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta se mulaakaat kii
 While playing the role of Chief Minister in these cases, the State President took the Chief Minister along with these legislators and met him and informed Kunwar Pranav Champion about the report filed against him and tried to calm the case
 
 ajay bhatta ne kaha ki party main kahin bhi koi gutbaji yaa asantosh nahin he
 Some local people have been accused of encroaching municipal land and a drain on Premnagar Ashram in Haridwar
 isi ko lekar premanagar ashram main maujuud maharaj ke samarthak lathi-dandon se las hokar meyar or unke saath aae nagar vikaas mantri madan kowshik samarthakon par tut pade
 Many activists, including the city mayor, were injured due to stone pelting and sticks
 samarthakon ke bich takaraav ke baad bhi ajay bhatta ne premanagar ashram pahunchakar unase ekant main baat kii
 Bhatt mediated between the two ministers and saved the case from escalating
 baharhaal, khinchataan kii ek ke baad ek ho rahi ghatnaon se sanghathan or janata main nakaaratmak sandesh jarur ja rahaa he

 Trimbakeshwar Nashik Simhastha is being held on Tuesday
 yani kumbh kaa dhwajarohan donon kumbh nagariyon main paaramparik vidhi vidhaan se hone ke saath hi kumbh kii aupchaarik shuruyaat ho gai he
 In addition to the three royal baths held during this Simhastha fair, more than ten crore devotees will take a dip in the holy stream of Godavari during the pious days of many festival days
 is paavan maukey par maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis or grih mantri rajnath singh bhi maujuud the
 Pankaja Munde, a minister in the state government, also appeared during this period
 tay muhoort ke anusaar subah saadhe chah baje vidhivat tareeke se puja-archana kii shuruyaat hui
 All the distinguished guests attended the puja
 devguru grah brihaspati ek baar phir singh raashi main aa rahaa he
 If Sun and Moon come in Cancer, then Trimbakeshwarnasik will spill drops of nectar and Simhastha will be Mahaparva
 har 12 saal baad lagane vaale sinhasth meley kaa dhwajarohan, karodon shraddhaluon, lakhon sadhu sanyasiyon or hajaaron mahamandaleshwaron, mahanton or shri mahanton se sajane vaale is meley main hajaaron saal kii parampara doharaai jaaegi
 Why Nashik Kumbh is one of the most important Kumbh and Simhastha fairs in the four cities of the country, trimbakeshwar-nashik Kumbhakai is different, unique and amazing
 yahaan do shaharon main shahi snaan hote hai
 That is, Shaivite ascetic Jyotirlinga Trimbakeshwar takes a royal bath in Kushavarta Kund, the revered site of Godavari in the city of Shiva, while the Vaishnava Bairagi saint takes a dip in the holy stream of Godavari at Ram Ghat in Nashik town of Panchvati, the exile of Lord Rama
 kya kahata he itihaasaitihaas ke pannon main darj he ki 18veen sadi main maharashtra main peshwaon ke raaj main pehle shahi snaan karne ke sawaal par shaiva sanyasiyon or vaishnav bairaagiyon ke bich hinsak sangharsh hua
 The Peshwas had stopped organizing Simhastha Kashi for decades
 phir peshwa shaskaon ne sadhu santon ke samjhaute ke baad shiv kii nagari tryambakeshwar main shaiva sanyasiyon ke or bhagwaan ram kii vanvaas sthali panchvati main vaishnav vairaagiyon ke shahi snaan kaa intjaam tay kiya or sinhasth phir se apni garima or mahima ke saath shuru ho gaya
 But the cities of Simhastha became two
 yani shraddha or utsav kaa dayera bad gaya
 Preparation and administration preparations for the Mahaparva, the date of the royal bath, have now reached the final stage as lodging and bathing is no sport for millions of saints and crores of devotees of the 13 akharas of indifferent saints with Shaivite ascetics and Vaishnava Bairagis
 
 har baar tamaam suraksha intjaamon ke baavjood haadase hote hai
 Hence the administration is being more vigilant
 paaramparik rup se yahaan bhi teen shahi snaan hote hai
 The first Shahi Snan of Simhastha 2015 will be on the full moon of Raksha Bandhan i
e
savan, the date will be 29 August
 doosraa shahi snaan 13 sitambar amavasya ko or teesraa shahi snaan 18 sitambar ko rishi panchami ke parvakaal main vaishnav bairangi sant karenge
 Shaivite monks will take a third royal bath dip in the holy waters of Godavari on Vusha Jayanti on 25 September at Kushavarta Kund in Trimbakeshwar
 dhwajarohan ke saath hi sinhasth kaa mangalacharan ho rahaa he
 After this, the flag hoisting ceremony of saints and saints and the entry of royal city i

 Peshwais will begin

 On 24 January this year, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) placed a military satellite weighing around 750 kilograms from the Sriharikota Launch Center in Andhra Pradesh in a lower orbit of the Earth about 300 km above
 isro ne iske uddeshy or vistrut sanrachanagat vivaranon ke bare main koi khaas jaankaree nahin di thi
 Since then ISRO scientists have been monitoring its progress in the same way as they do for other space assets of the country
 lekin, in vaigyanikon se kaaphi alag uddeshy ke saath raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan (diardio) bhi is upgrah kii nigaraanee main juta hua tha
 In mid-2016, the Narendra Modi government approved a highly confidential project for the development of an A-SAT or anti-satellite missile
 is pariyojna par diardio adhyaksh ji
 a team of scientists was working under the leadership of Satish Reddy
 prakshepan se pehle is pariyojna ke bare main keval jarurat bhar suchanaaen saajha kii ja rahi thim
 Senior missile specialist Reddy was aware of the challenges of developing such a missile
 ve bharat kii belistic missile pratiraksha (biemdi) pranali kii us team main rah chuke the
 This team has provided the basis for the development of the capabilities of locating very fast moving objects in the past 15 years, especially missiles, and killing them before hitting any part of India
 antariksh main kisi upgrah ko nasht karnaa kisi missile ko maar giraane se zyada jatil kaam he
 a satellite rotates in space at an extremely high speed of about seven kilometers per second and must be struck at an altitude of 300 kilometers or more above the surface of the Earth, while the BMD system has a maximum speed of 100 kilometers per second
 The missile was designed to strike
 sabase ahm baat vah sateek kshamta hasil karnaa tha jisase lakshith upgrah par waar kiya ja sake, jise kynetic kil kaha jaataa he
 To neutralize a satellite, an impact threshold of at least five centimeters is possible — meaning less than the width of your palm
 is sab kaa matlab teen charan vaala ek vishesh missile sangyojan taiyaar karnaa he jisamen vaahan ko us duuri tak le jane ke liye do charnon main booster hon
 Apart from this, a 'fire vehicle' was also to be developed with two 'dietvert launchers' so that it could be rotated at will
 imaging inphra-red (iiar) ke sahare lakshya khojane main samarth yah yaan apane lakshya upgrah ko dhundh kar us par sui kii nok bhar kii achookta se waar kar saktaa he
 The pace of work on a-sat had increased in the last six months after Reddy became the head of DRDO
 beete 25 march ko reddy ne isro pramukh ke
 Call Shivan and tell him to tell the scientists monitoring the microsat-r that DRDO is going to destroy the A-SAT missile from the launch center on Wheeler Island, Odisha in the next two days
 iske thik 20 din pehle diardio ne bhartiya vimaanapttan praadhikaran se aagrah kiya tha ki vah 27 march ke liye 'notice tu airmen (enotem)" jari karke sabhi hawaii parichaalanon ko prakshepan centre ke aasapaas ke akaash se dur rahane kii chetavanee jari kar de
 Subsequently, DRDO scientists commissioned the 14-meter long missile to be launched at the launch center and conducted all critical tests
 aakhri vakt main koi baadha na ho, yah sunishchit karne ke liye in vaigyanikon ko antim jaanch-padtaal ke liye raat bhar kaam karnaa padaa
 Meanwhile, drdo's long-range search radars were eyeing the targeted satellite
 vichaar yah tha ki upgrah par tab waar kiya jaae jab vah apni kaksha main chakkar katate hue bengal kii khadi main thik prakshepan centre ke upar ho
 11 on day 27 March for missile launch
 10 baje kaa samay nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 At exactly the time, the A-SAT missile went up in the sky with a huge roar
 agle 60 second main vah antariksh main 40 kilometre oonchai tak pahunch chukaa tha jab uskaa pehle charan kaa booster rocket usase alag ho gaya
 a minute later, it reached a height of 100 km, when the second stage rocket put the 'fire vehicle' on a path on which it could find its target satellite and hit it
 iske baad vaigyanikon ke dil kii dhadakanen 90 second ke liye maano ataki raheen
 The scientists were relieved when it was confirmed that the missile had hit the exact target and the target satellite had been destroyed
 reddy ne iske baad 11
 The success was reported on 20 minutes by phone to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 dobhaal ne yah jaankaree pradhanmantri ko di
 Shortly after, Modi tweeted and sent a message to the public that he was going to give some important messages between 12 noon and 12 noon
 puraa desh saans roke intjaar kar rahaa tha jab dopaher 12
 Looking excited at 35 pm, Modi announced on national television that India has become the fourth country after the US, Russia and China to be capable of developing anti-satellite weapon systems
 vaigyanikon ko badhai dete hue modi ne kaha, ''ek jor jahaan e-sat missile bharat kii takanic or suraksha vyavastha ko majboot karegi, vahiin main antarrashtriya samudaay ko aashwast karata hum ki bharat kii pratiraksha pahal keval apni suraksha ke liye he
 We are against the arms race in space
 "iske turant baad ek siyaasi tufaan uth khadaa hua ki kya modi ko yah ghoshnaa is tareeke se or pehle charan ke chunaav ke thik pehle kerani chahie thi
 Yet the Prime Minister has every right to take credit for it
 haalanki, bhartiya janata party ke pravaktaa aisa sanket kar rahe the ki ateet kii upie sarkaron ne e-sat ke vikaas ke liye jaruri duuradrushti or saahas nahin dikhaaya tha
 This could have been avoided
 ek vaigyanik ne is ore sanket kiya ki upie sarkaar ke daur main sweekrut or viksit biemdi pranali hi e-sat ke pehle kaa charan thi
 Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs issued a list of frequently asked questions, clarifying that this test did not generate any waste in space
 yah upgrah prithvi kii nichali katha main tha or iske tukade agle kuch saptahon main bina kisi tarah kii kshati pahunchaae prithvi par aa girenge
 The clarification reiterated that the test was done to protect and protect the nation's space assets, particularly espionage for military purposes, and not to launch an event such as Star Wars
 spashtikaran main yah bhi joda gaya ki bharat ummid karata he ki bhavishya main vah antariksh yatraaen kar rahe deshon kii ore se bahari antariksh main hathiyaar rakhe jane samet ''bahari antariksh main hathiyaaron kii hode rokane ke liye kisi antarrashtriya kanoon ke masaude ke vikaas" main bhoomika adaa karegaa
 On the other hand, Reddy and his crew were jumping with joy at the launch site in Odisha
 reddy ne india today se baatcheet main kaha ki yah desh ke liye mahaan takneekee uplabdhi he
 This missile was developed indigenously and we achieved a very high degree of precision capability which we had not tried before
 yah is vishisht takanic main hamaari mahatvapurn unnati kaa sanket he
 What has not been said is that even though the target in this test was 300 kilometers away, India now has the capability to target foreign space assets located even further away
 isse desh kii biemdi pranali main bhi unnati hui he or jarurat padane par zyada duuri kii shatru mixilon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Obviously, this is an important milestone in terms of security and technology

 '' mantralay disienes se naaraaz he ki usne jaankaree baantne main deree kii
 It is now known by all that the Chinese submarine is continuously increasing its penetration in the Indian Ocean and the submarine of Pakistan is also engaged in a strike
 bhartiya nausena ke paas vaise to kehane ko 10-12 pandubbiyaan hai lekin chaalu haalat main paanch-chah se zyada nahin hai
 So there is already a shortage of submarines and if information of what is being built from above is also leaked, then what will happen

 There is no doubt that this is a major setback for the Indian Navy, which is planning to challenge China in the Indian Ocean

 Of course there were many disputes between Raj Thackeray and Amitabh Bachchan, but now they have proved that these disputes are not bigger than Big B's personality
 mahanayake amitabh ke 75wein janmdin par raaj thakare ne fasebuk ke jariye apni dil kii baaten share kii hai
 He explained why there were disputes between them and what is the importance of Big b in their eyes
 raaj thakare se manch saajha karne par amitabh bachchan sapa ke nishane parraj thakare ne fasebuk par 266 shabdon kii lambii post likhi he
 His posts are in both Marathi and English languages
 unhone likhaa he- jab amitabh bachchan kii baat hoti he, to shabd kam pad jate hai
 Now that it is his 75th birthday, this occasion becomes even more special
 is baat main koi shaq nahin ki amitabh ne hindi cinema main kaaphi ahm yogadan diya he
 Over the years, many actors have come and gone, but the personality of Amitabh is such that he has become a legend of the entire Hindi cinema world
 thakare ne sirf big bi kii tarif hi nahin kii, unhone in vivaadon kaa bhi zikr kiya, jinaki vajah se donon ke bich matbhed rahe
 He wrote, 'A few years ago there were differences between him and me over the use of Marathi language
 haalanki main apane vichaaron par ab bhi kaayam hum, lekin sach ye he ki lata mangeshkar, amitabh bachchan or sachin tendulkar jaise ligends sirf ek rajya ke nahin, balki puure desh kii pahchaan hote hai
 Missing distances between Raj thackeray-amitabh Bachchan
 Next to this, Thackeray writes, 'of course i may have had differences with him, but i have never been in doubt about how big a personality he is for cinema
 ''raaj thakare ne big bi ke 75wein janmdin par kuch sctch bhi banaae hai
 He has written that this is a small gift for him from me
 bataa den ki ek vakt aisa bhi tha, jab emenes (maharashtra navnirmaan sena) chif ne un par ye iljaam tak laga diya tha ki wo maharashtra ke vikaas main khaas yogadan nahin de rahe hai, jabaki wo yahaan itane saalon se rah rahe hai
 Then Jaya Bachchan said that we are UP people, would prefer to speak in Hindi
 2013 main unki is takaraar kaa ant tab hota najar aayaa, jab big bi ne raaj thakare kaa invitesan except kiya tha
 Thackeray had called him on the occasion of the anniversary of the MNS film Wing, which featured Big B
 tab se lekar ab tak raaj thakare unke janmdin par kuch na kuch khaas karte aa rahe hai
 This time through Facebook posts and sketches, he has been seen doing something similar
 ab dekhte hai ki big bi kii is par kya pratikriya rahati he

 It is being described as economic slowdown, but analyzing GDP figures, there is a strong possibility that the country has actually reached a period of recession
 isaki pramukh vajah yah he ki rashtriya sankhyikee karyaalay (NSO) asangathit kshetra main growth ko maapne ke liye sangathit kshetra ke data kaa istemaal karata he or yah maan liya jaataa he ki donon sector samaan dar se aage bad rahe hai
 Remind you that NSO data shows that quarterly GDP has been falling for six consecutive quarters
 vitt varsh 2018 kii chauthi timahi ke 8
 4 in the last quarter of FY 2020 from 1 per cent
 5 fisadi ho gai he
 How the quarterly GDP is measured: Looking at the announcement made by the NSO while releasing the GDP growth figures for the second quarter of FY 2019, it gives an idea as to what is the source of these figures
 krishi kshetra kaa data timahi anumaan ke liye rajyon se liya jaataa he, lekin industry or sevaaon jaise gaiyr krishi sector ke liye isamen nimna aankadon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he-a
 IIP manufacturing data is used for manufacturing of semi-corporate or unorganized segments
 B
 Corporate sector and banking data are used for financial, real estate and professional services
 C
 GST and sales tax data are used for trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting
 D
 IIP electricity is used for electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services
 E
 Data for cement production and finished steel consumption are taken for construction etc
 to yah bilkul saaf he ki sabhi ke liye aankadon kaa strot sangathit kshetra hi he
 So the quarterly figures of GDP will be completely correct only when both organized and organized sectors are growing at the same rate
 vastav main pranab sen (arthshaastri or sankhyikivid) ne 2011-12 main rashtriya sankhyikeey ayog (NSC) ke chairman ke rup main jidipi ke base main badlaav kiya or unke baad is pad par aae pi
 C
 mohanan ne is baat kii pushti kii thi ki timahi akalan main asangathit kshetra ke aankadon ke liye sangathit kshetra ke growth rate ko shaamil kiya jaataa he
 But if both are not growing at the same rate, this leads to a misleading picture and how much fault there is will depend on the size and share of organized sector in GDP
 jidipi main asangathit kshetra kaa hissaa kitna bada he?is bare main koi aadhikarik jaankaree nahin he ki timahi jidipi kaa anumaan lagane main enessi kya karata he
 In 2012, the report of the Committee on Unorganized Sector Statistics of the NSC stated that: '90% of the workers and about 50% of the national product is estimated by the informal economy
 ’pehle kii neshnal kamishan for enterprijej in da anorganijd sector (NCEUS) kii ek aadhikarik report ke anusaar, asangathit kshetra or jivie kaa anupaat 1999-2000 main 55
 24 per cent and 49 in 2004-05
 9 fisadi rahaa he
 Not only this, in the 2018-19 Economic Survey released on July 4, 2019, it said, 'about 93% of the total workforce belongs to the' informal workforce '
 sen kehete hai ki jidipi siries ke 2011-12 ke base main badlaav ke dauraan asangathit kshetra kaa yogadan 47 fisadi mana gaya
 Thus, it can be safe to assume that the unorganized sector contributes about 50 per cent of GDP
 iskaa matlab yah he ki yadi donon sector main samaan dar se badhat nahin hoti he to timahi jidipi anumaan main bade margin kaa antar aa saktaa he
 There is no official data on whether the organized and unorganized sector is growing at the same rate, so that there is no impact on the demonetisation or GST on the unorganized sector, but there can be no dispute in this That both these events have had a negative impact on our economy
 sen kehete hai ki in ghatnaon kaa asar sangathit kshetra se bhi zyada asangathit kshetra par hua he, sabase zyada asar notebandi kaa hua he or jiesti kaa thodaa kam asar hua he
 Recognizing that both these developments have reduced the growth of the unorganized sector, he said: 'from 2017-18 till now, the GDP estimate is being shown exaggeratedly
 jidipi anumaanon kaa asangathit or sangathit kshetra ke growth ke alag-alag rate hone kaa kya asar hota he uski vah motaa-moti gananaa pesh karte karte hai
 He says that the unorganized sector accounts for 47 per cent of the GDP (estimated at the time of finalizing the GDP series for 2011-12), with agriculture at 17 per cent, trade at 9 per cent and manufacturing and service sector 21 per cent
 krishi sambandhit aankade centre sarkaar rajyon se leti he, jabaki trade kaa data jiesti se hasil kiya jaataa he
 But 21% of the unorganized sector, such as manufacturing and services, do not get real figures
 ve kehete hai ki jidipi ke timahi aankadon ke akalan ke dauraan is 21 fisadi hisse kaa vastav main maapan hi nahin kiya jaataa
 He said, 'we have no idea about what is done to this 21 per cent of GDP
 iske alaava timahi jidipi ke aankade ‘zyada kharaab’ hai, kyonki timahi aadhaar par to sangathit kshetra ke bhi aankade nahin mil pate
 However, economist Professor Arun Kumar has a slightly different opinion
 unka kahana he ki transporter, kaarobaari or menuphaccharing sanghathan aadi lagaataar mili ‘teen aarthik jhatkon’- notebandi, jiesti or gaiyr banking vittiya companiyon (nbfcs) ke sankat kii vajah se apane kaarobaar main 15 fisadi giravat kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 According to reports, the business was not very encouraging during this festive season (dussehra and Diwali)
 is baar kanjumar durables or retail kii bikri main 15-20 fisadi kaa ijapha hua, jabaki pichley saal isamen 27 fisadiki badhat hui thi
 In this regard, the expenditure on advertising increased by only 8 to 9 percent, while in the previous year it had increased by 13 to 14 percent
 yahaan tak ki yadi asangathit kshetra ke kaarobaar me 10 fisadi kii giravat ko bhi maan liya jaae to professor kumaar ke anusaar, iskaa matlab yah he ki asangathit kshetra kaa growth mines 3
 1 percent (-3
 1 %) he, yani isamen giravat ai he
 It reckons that the unorganized sector accounts for 45 per cent of the GDP, of which the agricultural sector is 14 per cent and the non-agricultural sector is 31 per cent
 mines main he jidipi badhat!ab yah dekhte hue ki sangathit kshetra (jiskaa hissaa 55 fisadi maan sakate ho) main timahivaar 4
 Growing at 5 per cent, it can be assumed that its contribution to quarterly GDP growth is just 2
 4 fisadi he
 So negative 3 of the unorganized sector
 1 fisadi ke growth ko isamen se gata len to aisa lagata he ki shuddh rup se timahi jidipi badhat mines 0
 4 percent (-0
 4%) he
 Professor Kumar insists, 'this is how we have reached a period of recession
 ’(saal 2018-19 main jidipi main krishi kaa hissaa 14
 38%, manufacturing 18
 04%, samoochee industry kaa 23
 13% and services 62
 5% tha)professor kumaar ne yah bhi anumaan lagaaya he ki asangathit kshetra kekaarobaar kaa akalan jiesti sangrah se bhi yato nahin hota yaa bahut kam hota he
 This is because: (a) Those whose total annual turnover is less than 40 lakhs are exempt from it (b) Those whose turnover is 40 lakhs to 1
 5 karod rupee tak he unhen compojit skim ke tahat sirf 1 fisadi kaa tex dene kii chhot he or (c) purv vitt mantri arun jetali ke mutabik 95 fisadi tex sirf 4 lakh karadaataaon (3%) se aata he
 Mohanan, who was the chairman of NSC until the beginning of this year, says: 'I believe that quarter GDP is never based on actual data except in a few cases
 is saaf dikh rahe bemail kaa ek acha udhaaharan yah he ki notebandi ke baad aakhir timahi jidipi kis tarah se badha dikhaa, jabaki har koi yah jaanata he ki arthvyavastha kii haalat acchhee nahin thi
 Thus the quality of quarterly GDP has its own limitations
 to timahi jidipi ke aankade yadi gumraah karne vaale hai, to isi tarah isse jude anya aarthik sanketak bhi ho sakate hai, jinka istemaal yah dikhaane ke liye hota he ki abhi mandi nahin ai he jaise- prati vyakti jidipi (utpaadan yaa utpaada), prati vyakti sakal or shuddh rashtriya aay (GNI or NNI), nijee upbhog (PFCE) or puunji nirmaan (GFCF)
 Apart from this, there are many worrying figures
 kamgaaron kii sankhya ghat rahi haisaal 2017-18 kii periodic lebar force survey (PLFS) se yah pataa chalata he ki na keval berogari dar 45 saal ke oonche str par 6
 1 per cent, but even bigger crisis seems to be forming in the country
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki shrambal bhagidaari dar (LFPR-15 saal yaa usase bade aise log jo yaa to kaam kar rahe hai yaa kaam kii talash main hai) saal 2011-12 ke 55
 49% in the year 2017-18 from 9%
 8% rah gaya he or desh main pehali baar isamen giravat ai he
 The decline in LFPR means that people are going out of the workforce due to lack of work
 azim premaji uniwarsity dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan main PLFS 2017-18 kaa vishleshan karte hue kaha gaya ki bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar 2011-12 or 2017-18 ke bich 90 lakh naukariyaan gai hai
 It should be kept in mind that India's annual growth rate in the year 2017-18 is 7
 2 fisadi thi or ab yah growth rate ghatakar 4
 It is 5 percent
 iskaa matlab he ki berogari kii haalat or badtar ho sakati he or isi tarah se ek badi jansankhya kii vittiya sehat bhi, khaskar gramin ilaakon main
 Poverty is on the rise for the first time since the government recently dumped the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) of the NSO for 2017-18, questioning its data quality
 asal main isaki report li ho gai thi jisamen tasviir bahut kharaab dikh rahi thi
 From this leaked report, it shows that for the first time in the last 40 years in 'real' (adjusted by inflation) per household consumer expenditure
 7 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 It declined from Rs 1501 in 2011-12 to 1,446 per cent in 2017-18
 us samay bhi yah baat dhyaan rakhni hogi ki bharat kii salanaa jidipi badhat 7
 Was 2 percent
 nishchit rup se 4
 Things will get worse at a growth rate of 5 per cent
 to yahi vah baat he jiske aadhaar par professor kumaar apane tark ko majboot karte hai ki bharat ab mandi ke daur main pahunch chukaa he
 This may not happen, but in the absence of official data, the debate on recession is meaningless

 in tathyon kaa zikr isliye kyonki unki nai kitaab tinkaa tinkaa dasna main unki shakhsiyat ke ye sabhi shed aapako mil jaaenge
 This book is actually the second episode of an interesting series
 tihaad ke baad desh kii duusari sabase charchit dasna jail ke bheetar ke jivan ko unhone kareeb se jaakar dekha
 Not only this, he wrote poems to the convicted prisoners, got the paintings done and wrote a song himself to the prisoners which has now become the introduction song of the prison and is sung there every morning and evening
 tinkaa tinkaa ke silsile ko ve ab agra or phir gujarat kii kisi jail tak le jane ko taiyaar hai
 Well, among the five life sentences of Dasna jail, the glimpse of the changing lives of the five is in the book, Talwar couple (rajesh-nupur), accused in the Aarushi murder case and Surinder Koli, accused of Nithari incident
 inke alaava umrakaidiyon kii hi gayan mandali or ek chitrakaar vivek bhi he, jisaki pratibha vahaan nikhari
 Here are the excerpts related to the book: Talwar Aarushi wanted to study at AIIMS
 vah doctor hona chaahati thi
 All the companions of Nupur and Rajesh, their children have now become dentists or are about to become
 kuch din pehle rajesh biimaar hue to unhen ames le jaaya gaya
 Going all the way and then there, they could not recover from the prick of thinking that this is where Aarushi would have been studying medicine today
 vah doctor banane kii taiyaari main hoti
 But time has changed so much that he is sitting here today as an accused
 par samay bataa kar kab palata he
 The life of both is no more
 sab kuch badla he
 Yes, one thing Rajesh does not do now
 ve baahar kii taraf nahin dekhte
 
 
 For months after coming here, he used to look towards the outside door with the hope that the team of CBI would come and say that doctor, we made a mistake
 ab yah sabit ho gaya he ki aap donon bekasoor hai
 Rajesh's brother comes once a week
 ve ankhon ke doctor hai
 They organize a free camp to check the eyes of detainees every here
 rajesh kii bhabhi vandana bhi sampark main rahati hai or doctorl ke apane peshey ke baad unke paas jitna bhi samay bachataa he, vah rajesh or noopur ke liye hi rahata he
 
 
 Vandana is concerned about where people remember that even the government considered a section of the media to be irresponsible
 logon ko shaayad sirf vahi yaad he jo unhen parosa gaya tha
 When and how the memory associated with the photographs will be erased, the prick does not let them rest
 talwaar film ai lekin rajesh or noopur use dekhne se bachate rahe hai
 Jails may be shown in films, but the presence of films in jail is still not a reality
 isliye khud talwaar apane par hi bani talwaar ko kab dekh sakenge, koun jane
 Rajesh has wet eyes
 noopur neeche dekh rahi hai
 Rajesh is saying that all our companions went far ahead and came back very far from where we were
 nahin jaanate, ve kab baahar honge or jab bhi honge to samaaj unhen kaise sweekaaregaa
 Where are the limits of the prison able to decide all things
 dentist kii jo padhai unhone kii thi, vah ek din jail ke andar unka sabase bada sahaara banegi, iskaa unhen ilm tak na tha
 Everyday used to spend some time in studying
 in dinon noopur ol da lite dait ve can naat si pard rahi hai
 Rajesh asked them to read it
 ve aatmakatha likhnaa chaahati hai lekin dil or dimag aapas main baat nahin kar pate
 There are so many layers that the words start getting wet, the paper melts
 main jab baat karti hum to kabhi rajesh kuch kehete hai, kabhi noopur
 i do not question main kam bolti hum
 i just look at the eyes and find each time that both of them complement each other's words
 jab rajesh kii aawaaj doobane lagati he to noopur un vaakyon ko puraa kar detii hai or jab noopur ke paas himmat nahin rahati to rajesh ke paas baat kehane kaa sarokaar aa jaataa he
 Jail has brought these two closer than ever
 donon ek duusare ke saathi, sahpaathee, humsafar, premi hai
 Every prisoner he spoke to said that no one ever saw these two quarreling, even raging
 donon kii saansen aapas main judi hai
 Amazing relevance
 donon ek hi jail main hai par mulaakaat roj nahin hoti
 Jail has its own rules, so there is distance
 par duuri ke baavjood aapasi sammaan he, atmiyata he
 One day when i went to jail, i found the detainees worried for Rajesh
 unhen teen din tej bukhaar rahaa
 Those captives seemed to distract me more than Rajesh
 
 
 aise hi ek or din rajesh talwaar bahut biimaar the
 He had a drip in jail
 noopur unhen dekhne ke liye kuch baichaiyn thim par ve us bechaini kaa izhaar nahin karnaa chaahati thim
 The trouble of not being able to find her husband locked at a distance of a few steps was evident
 us din unhone sisitivi par rajesh ko aspataal se baahar aate dekha or ve chup rah gayi
 They have adopted this world
 chuppi ke saath
 Everyone has their own misery here and only has a relationship with sorrow
 sab kisi safar main hai
 No one knows whose journey will end
 jail aaj main jeena sikhaati he
 It also gives torn aspects of hope
 talwaar dampati ne jail ko or jail ne unhen apana liya he
 The media seems to be in the midst of an all-night sleep and groan that declared them darinda and murderer even before the first hearing of the court
 ve maanate hai ki daivik sunwaayee honi abhi baaki he
 He hopes that when that decision is made, Aarushi will probably be somewhere
 is 24 may ko uski 21veen saalagirah thi
 Incidentally, the same song was playing in the barrack of the jail that Aarushi used to listen to loudly on the speaker every day while taking a 10-minute break while studying - what magic she did at first sight, tera bana hai mera jiya, jane What will happen, what will happen, do not know, come together this moment
 maine chalate hue aakhir main poocha he—kabhi apni pasand kaa kuch khaane kaa man hota ho to? jail pasand se thode hi na chalati he
 *** Surinder Koli: Now the expert of law is Surinder Koli
 nithari cond iskaa ek parichay he
 The hanging was done but the film was postponed in style
 sajaa hone se kuch din pehle use meerut jail bhej diya gaya tha kyonki faansee ghar vahiin par he
 The night before the sentence, the top officials of the jail in Meerut and Ghaziabad kept awake because at the last moment there was an order to postpone their sentence
 sajaa tal gai
 Koli was brought back to Ghaziabad
 abaki baar jo coli lautaa, vah pehle se bhi zyada aashwast tha
 Koli was replaced by the prison
 takreeban anpadh coli ke jail ke shuruaati din duvidha ke the
 He did not understand legal language
 na hi takanic
 Two of his lawyers were in the light of the media getting this case
 usamen coli andhere main tha
 Koli learned to read and write in captivity
 
 
 shuru ke kuch din to apane maalik pandher ke saath yahaan band tha
 Then to understand matters, this same servant of Pandher started reading English from him
 kuch samay baad pandher reeha ho gaya
 Now Koli is left alone
 lekin coli haara nahin
 He took papers from prison, took a pen from prison, piled up new and old books and struggled with black letters
 sabase pehle usne hindi or urdu sikhi
 Such delusions of being literate have not been seen so far in any of the captives of Dasna
 apni jaan bachaane ke liye coli ne kitabon or kaagajon ko apane bistar ke paas tikaaya or lag gaya dub kar padhgaye
 Characters became his cover
 aaj coli kanoon kii bhashaa kaa maharathi he
 The legal intricacies, his language and his style are fully understood by him
 vah artiai kaa export he
 To save his life, he has set such RTI so that no one can get surprised
 ek artiai to yah bhi lagaai ki jis naalee main bacchon ke itane shav mili the, vah aakhri baar saaf kab hui thi
 Koli has no answer in extracting the meaning of his work from the official fixed answer
 maine coli se jaananaa chaha—vah jail main samay kaise katata he
 His answer was — he reads documents, books and arguments related to his case all day
 vah bahut vyast rahata he
 He has no time to waste
 maine kaha ki kya tum kitaab ke liye apni koi kavita doge to uskaa jawaab tha ki use kavita nahin, sirf kanoon samaj main aata he
 Then he started crying
 jail ke apane pravaas main pehali baar royaa
 Jail officials say he never got sick
 kabhi royaa nahin
 He prefers to be surrounded in files rather than engulfed in depression and firmly believes that if anyone can protect him, he himself
 uske ghar se koi milane nahin aata
 He has no news of anyone and no longer trusts anyone
 vah jaanata he ki media main uske bare main kya likhaa gaya he
 But now he does not mind anything
 jail ne coli ko halaat ke saamne chattan bana diya he
 He does not talk about his crime
 vah bachaav kii baat karata he
 He cross-examines himself before every hearing
 khud hi se sawaal
 Answer by itself vah khud hi jaj banataa he, khud hi police
 The prison has introduced him to the streets of the law which were unknown to him
 sabase badi baat—aaj vah sakshar he
 *** a Rangrez, gone Vivek 32 years old Vivek is a resident of Visakhapatnam
 kareeb 8 maheene kii yahaan kii rihaaish ke dauraan vivek ne shivaji yadav (dipti jailer) ko bataaya ki use painting kaa shauk he
 
 
 What Vivek created in a few days shocked everyone
 usne ek diwaar main sadak banaai or donon taraf ped
 The painting was made entirely on the concept of 3-D — in such a way that whenever one looks at the painting, it seems as if a street has been made on the prison wall
 
 
 pehali baar jab vivek se meri mulaakaat hui to usne bataaya ki kuch samay pehle jab vah vishakhapatnam se apane bhai se milane dilli aayaa tha to usne tihaad jail ke baahar tinkaa tinkaa tihaad kii tarj par bani mural painting ko dekha tha or uski tamanna waisi hi kisi badi diwaar par apane andaaj se rang karne kii thi
 What did he know then that the next time he would come from Visakhapatnam to Ghaziabad, circumstances would bring him to jail
 maine vivek se dasna jail kii hi ek diwaar par tinkaa tinkaa dasna kii 3-di painting banane ke liye kaha
 The top officials of the jail ordered all colors, new brushes and ladders at Vivek's behest
 
 
 chaar maheene kii mehnat ke baad taiyaar hui tinkaa tinkaa dasna kii yah diwaar
 Vivek was the captive under consideration
 jis din diwaar par aakhri kuchi lagi, vivek kii rihaai aa gai

 rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad congress kii kaman ek baar phir sonia gandhi ke haathon main he
 His biggest test is to keep party leaders together in Haryana
 vakt or siyasat ne sonia gandhi ko aisi jagah laakar khadaa kar diya he ki unke saamne phir se party main jaan foonkane kii chunauti he
 Twenty years ago in 1998, he started his political journey by addressing a rally from Rohtak, Haryana, as the star campaigner of the Congress
 18 agast ko purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda usee rohtak main raily kar party haikaman ko chunauti dene ja rahe hai
 Let me tell you that in 2005, Sonia Gandhi preferred Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Haryana instead of her senior leader Bhajan Lal
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki bhajanlaal ne congress ko alavida kahkar apni alag party bana lee thi
 While Hooda was the Chief Minister of Haryana for ten years
 ab vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hooda party alaakaman ko apni siyaasi takat kaa ehsaas karaane ke liye rohtak main parivartan raily karne ja rahe hai
 Without informing the top leadership of the Congress, Hooda's rally in Rohtak has raised many questions
 bhupendra singh hooda ne rohtak kii 'parivartan mahareli' main pradesh sanghathan or ol india congress cameti ke kisi netaa ko nahin bulaayaa he
 In such a situation, it is believed that in this rally, Bhupendra Singh Hooda can declare a separate alliance with the Congress and form his own party
 iske alaava yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle saudebaaji ke liye mahaul banane kii unki kavayad he
 However, at one stage, Sonia Gandhi had preferred Hooda over Haryana veteran Bhajan Lal
 sonia se rishte main khatas tab ai thi, jab 2016 main hooda ne congress ke rajyasabha candidet aarake anand kaa saport karne se manaa kar diya tha
 As a result, RK Anand lost and Subhash Chandra won the Rajya Sabha as an independent candidate
 congress main uthal-puthal machi hui he
 In Haryana, the Congress is divided into groups
 hooda or pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ke bich siyaasi varchasv kii jang kisi se chhipi hui nahin he
 Bhupendra Singh Hooda is once again presenting the challenge through the rally
 aise main dekhnaa he ki sonia gandhi or unki team hooda kii raar se kaise paar paati he
 This will also show how Sonia deals with the bargainers in her second innings

 We encourage India and Pakistan to resolve their differences jointly
 ham pehle bhi aisa karte rahe hai
 He, however, did not respond to a question about helping India and Pakistan resolve the issue
 unhone kaha, jaisaa maine kaha, ham bharat or pakistan ko aapasi matbhed sulajhane ke liye dwipaksheeya sahyog ke saath kaam karne ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 "we are in regular contact with the governments of India and Pakistan on this broad issue," Kirby said

 The procession had arrived on time
 baratiyon kaswaagat jor-shor se ho rahaatha
 The rest of the ceremony was just left
 phir dulhan hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye duulhaa kii ho jaati
 But once this happens, another bride reaches the wedding procession
 phir kya tha puraa seen hi badal jaataa he
 Then when the noise of the clarinet stops, it is revealed that the story is of the groom 420
 darasal, ye kissa hai lakhanu ke hazaratganj ilaake main maujuud ek aaleeshaan hotel kii, jahaan ek shaadi se pehle hi ekladki kii sarprize entrine sabko sannaate main daal diya
 Now, about three and a half kilometers from Lucknow, we go to Moradabad in western Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan kamobesh ek jaisi tasviir he
 All the wedding preparations have been completed here too
 naate-rishtedaar or tamaam mehmaan badhaaiyaan dene aa pahunche hai
 Rather, the groom is already present here in his in-laws' house with the King Baratis
 lekin isi bich yahaan bhi ek ladki kii maujuudagi se khalabali much jaati he
 It becomes ruckus
 sawaal yahaan bhi vahi he
 After all, what does this girl want? Two girls are present as guests without invitations in both the places
 or donon hi kisi or ladki kii zindagi bachaa le janaa chaahati hai
 But what is this scene after all? Who are these girls? They are talking about saving their lives
 or in ladakiyon kii is koshish kaa aakiri anjaam kya hota he?to aaie, aapako ek baar phir lakhanu ke hazaratganj liye chalate hai
 There is still uproar at Jahanhotel's gate
 darasal, lakhanu ke posh ilaake yani gomtinagar ke ek kaarobaari ne yahaan apane bete kii shaadi tay kii he
 The procession has come to this hotel in Hazratganj
 lekin isse pehle ki shaadi ho paati, is ladki ne duulhe par hi apana daawa thok diya he
 The girl says that she was married to a boy named Abhishek Tripathi in a temple on May 25
 lekin ladkaa use gachha dekar yahaan duusari shaadi karne ke firaaq main he
 And she will not allow this to happen at any cost
 ab ladki khud andar pahunch kardulhe se do-do haath karnachahti he, lekin gharaati-baaraati or hotelvaale aade aa jate hai
 Now the girl calls and immediately calls the police on the spot
 police sulah safaai ke saath-saath maamle ko sajhamane ke liye andar janaa chaahati he
 But along with the girl, the hotel security personnel also push the policemen out of the hotel
 or aisa tab he, jab ladki pehle hi apni shikaayat police ko de chuki he
 The FIR has been written
 lekin ladki kaa ilzaam he ki chunki police ne uskaa saath nahin de rahi he
 So he has to get down to direct action
 jabaki maukey par aa pahunchi daaroga alag hi kahani bayaan karti hai
 What action the police took on the girl's complaint is not known
 lekin mahila thana prabharee kanakalata dube kii baton se itnaa zarur lagata he ki unhone shikaayat ke liye pahunchi is ladki ko daraane kii koshish zarur kii thi
 So, the matter reached here and then the same thing happened
 jiskaa dar tha
 The groom escaped from the spot by taking advantage of this police action
 kahani muradabad kiye kahani he muradabad ke civil lines kii
 The procession came here from Gurgaon
 duulhaa ejeeniyar tha
 There was a lot of fame in the area, so even the girls did not take any time to establish the relationship
 lekin isse pehle ki is rishte ko naam miltaa, shaadi hoti
 Along with the groom, his wife also attended here with proof of their marriage
 or to or uski god main do saal kaa ek baccha bhi tha or ye ladki duulhe ko is bachche kaa baap bataa rahi thi
 That too with all the evidence
 ab vahi log jo itani der tak duulhe raja or baratiyon ke swaagat main bichhe ja rahe the
 Various dishes were offered
 mauka bhaanp kar asaliyat par aa gaye
 He immediately set up the house of all the relatives including the groom and took the baraatis hostage
 chunki ilzaam behad sangeen tha
 Hearing of that girl was necessary to make milk of milk and water of water
 jo god main apane apane do saal ke bachche ko liye usee gudgaanv se yahaan tak aa pahunchi thi
 Whence the procession came, everything he said was shocking
 is ladki kaa kahana tha ki sahil naam ke duulhe ke saath naa sirf uski shaadi ko teen saal ho chuke hai
 He also has a two-year-old son
 ye or baat he ki sahil kaafii dinon se usase peechha chhudaane kii koshish main he
 So, she has knocked on the door of the law with her fight and DNA test done on the court's order has also proved that the innocent father in her lap is nobody else but the same Sahil, who is himself Describing a bachelor is in a bid to marry again
 lekin had to ye he ki sabakuch saamne hone ke baad bhi ye shaks apni patni or bachche ko pahchaanane se hi inkaar kar rahaa he
 But when the evidence is in front, why would anyone listen to the weak groom's argument? So, the girls not only took them hostage, but also made it clear that they did not let them return all the dowry items
 ab ek ladki ko dhokhaa dekar duusare se shaadi karne kaa khwab dekhne vaale duulhe raja or unke gharavaalon ko munh kii khaani padi or bairang lautnaa padaa

 They (mlas) are being saved from every side, they should be sent to jail as soon as possible
 ajtak se baat karte hue peedita kii bahan kaaphi bhavuk ho gai or foot-foot kar rone lagi
 He said that nothing will happen if the investigation is not done honestly
 unhone bataaya ki vidhayak kaa bhai atul singh maarthe hue le gaya or police khadi he to wo bhi usamen hi shaamil hui
 What is this government watching? peedita kii bahan ne kaha ki abhi suraksha he, kal ko nahin rahegi to kya bharosa ye log kya karenge

 isi bich, yah khabar bhi ai he ki grih mantralay ne ek artiai ke jawaab main kaha he ki netaji subhash chandra bose kii mrityu vimaan durghatana main 1945 main hui thi
 It is believed that this could become a major emotional issue in West Bengal, although the BJP has been very active on the Bose issue since the Lok Sabha elections
 centre sarkaar ne pashchim bengal chunaavon ke maddenjar netaji se judi filein saarvajanik karnaa shuru kiya tha
 More than a hundred files have been made public so far and are available on the website

 The comments gauratlab he ki pashchim bengal main bijepi jabardast jor laga rahi he
 In the Assembly by-election, BJP came second behind the congress-left

 Amit Shah had recently visited the state for three days, but the Home Ministry's response to the emotional issue of Bose's death may put a dent in this hard work
 rajya ke chunaavon main yah bhaavnaatmak mudda uthta rahaa he
 Now this information given by the Ministry of Home Affairs has been started by the family members of Netaji associated with the BJP
 aise main sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya centre sarkaar in donon muddon par dobaaraa vichaar karegi
 At least the government has also started rethinking the issue of notification of cattle business
 sutron ke mutabik- sarkaar ko lag rahaa he ki is adhisuchana kii bhashaa main kuch takneekee gadhbadiyaan hai
 Also, it is not practical to implement some provisions on the ground
 isi bich khabar ai he ki sarkaar bhens ko is adhisuchana ke daayre se baahar karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 Significantly, in West Bengal, BJP is putting a lot of emphasis

 Pemra on Saturday asked all channels to stop 'illegal Indian broadcasts' with immediate effect
 pemara nepiocemen aatanki thikaanon par bhartiya sena ke sargical strike ke baad ye kadam uthaaya
 "A comprehensive strategy will be implemented to effectively prevent the spread of Indian channels through illegal DTH and excessive use of Indian content on satellite TV channels and FM radios," Pemra said in a statement on Sunday
 'pemara ne kaha ki ritred janaralparvej musharrafne tivi par bhartiya drama or cinemagharon main bhartiya filmon ko dikhaane kii anumati bharat ko khush karne ke liye di thi

 After the Bihar incident came to light, the state government has issued instructions regarding the mid-day meal
 nirdeshon main kaha gaya he ki bacchon ko bhojan vitarit kiye jane se pehle vidhyalay ke shikshak bhojan ko chakhen
 Opposing this order of the government, the President of Jabalpur unit of the State Teachers Association, Narendra Tripathi has written a letter to the officials of all the development blocks and tehsil level, saying that they should not taste food
 bacchon ko baante jane se pehle bhojan kutton ko jarur khilaaen
 Tripathi says that teachers are not the object of tests, so this system is not appropriate
 sarkaar ko bacchon ko baanta jane vaala bhojan pehle kutton ko khilaane par jor dena chahie, shikshakon ko pareekshan kii vastu bananaa thik nahin he
 On this issue, Shivendra Singh, Chief Executive Officer of the District Panchayat of Jabalpur, says that food in the schools in rural areas form self-help groups, which are formed in the school
 isliye shikshak ko bhojan chakhne ke baad bacchon ko dena chahie
 Apart from this, there is also a packet of food distributed by the Nandi Foundation, which is also responsible for sending it to the school
 chaatro se pehle kute ko bhojan khilaanaa sambhav nahin he
