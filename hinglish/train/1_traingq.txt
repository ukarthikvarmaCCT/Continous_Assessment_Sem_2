 jet airways ke dobaaraa udne kii ummiden us samay puri tarah khatm ho gayi jab malikana haq rakhane vaale state bank of india ne rashtriya company vidhi nyaayaadhikaran (ensielti) main company ke khilaaf diwalia prakriya shuru karne kii apil daakhil kii
 NCLT will hear this on Wednesday
 is bich beete do dinon main jet airways ke share kii keemat 70 fisadi se zyada tut gai
 Jet Airways stock is trading near Rs 32 per share in Wednesday's business
 karj main dubi airlines diwalia ho jaaegi, lekin bada sawaal yah he ki duubataa jet apane saath kis kis ko le duba? nuksaan kii aanch aam aadmi kii jeb tak pahunchnaa bhi tay he
 In this news, we will talk about the various stakeholders who will suffer from the closure of Jet Airways
 bainkon ko baari nuksaan – jet ke paas kitne vimaanon kaa malikana haq he yah to ensielti kii prakriya shuru hone ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 But it is certain that Jet does not have total assets equal to the banks' debt
 bainkon kaa airlines par 8000 karod rupye kaa karj bakaayaa he
 In such a situation, banks will incur huge losses, which in technical language is called haircut
 bazaar ke visheshgy maan rahe hai yah heirkat 80 fisadi ke baraabar tak ho saktaa he
 Vendors are also in trouble - more than 100 vendors serving Jet Airways owe more than Rs 10,000 crore
 inamen lij par vimaan dene vaali companiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Vendors for whom Jet Airways was the biggest client will also face an existential crisis
 yani jet apane saath saath 100 se zyada un weders kii aanthik sehat bhi kharaab karegaa jo koi saamaan yaa seva kii aapurti karte the
 Crisis on Employee - Jet has over 3000 crore dues of 23000 employees
 karmchaariyon ko march se vetan nahin mila he
 These employees have not only suffered economic losses, but the new job crisis is also facing them
 niveshkon ke nuksaan – jet main nivesh karne vaale niveshkon kii puunji beete ek saal main 90 fisadi se zyada dub gai
 a year ago, Jet Airways share price was close to Rs 399 per share, which is trading close to Rs 32 per share on Wednesday
 un lakhon niveshkon ko jinaki puunji jet main nivesh karke swaha ho gai unhen ensielti se bhi koi raahat nahin milegi
 Damage to the general public as well - whether the promoters of the company may have made mistakes in the company, banks have given loans or made wrong policies in the government or the regulators, but understand that when the drowning will affect the common man even on the road
 Never traveled in Jet Airways in life
 samajhie kaise, esbiai ke netrivy main jin 26 bainkon kaa 8500 karod rupye bakaayaa he, unki vaapasi na hone par yah nuksaan bainkon ko uthaanaa hoga
 This loss will reduce the capital of the banks and the capital shortage will be done by the government by recapitalizing the banks with taxpayers' money
 jet ke doobane ke desh ke aviation kshetra par bhi kai nakaaratmak asar honge
 For example, the dominance of some companies, arbitrary fares etc

 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main congress kii nai sarkaron kii ore se kisaanon kii karjamaafee(loan waiver) ke baad desh bhar main kisaanon ko iskaa laabh dene kii maang jor pakad rahi he
 After both the states, in the bjp-ruled Gujarat and Assam, the loan waiver exercise has started, giving the farmers concession

 NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar told NDTV - If such circumstances happen in the whole country that loan waiver is necessary, the central government will think about it
 ek baar ye faisla 2008 main ho chukaa he
 If necessary, this issue can at least be discussed
 is prastaav par vichaar sambhav he
 At the same time, he also said that the NITI Aayog believes that debt waiver is not a solution
 ye puri jimmedaari rajya sarkaron kii he
 It does not interfere with the center and the state
 niti ayog ne suzav diya ki rajya sarkaron ko lone maafee kaa faisla apni vittiya sthiti ko dekhakar hi uthaanaa chahie
 Commenting on the Prime Minister's statement on GST, Rajiv Kumar said that these initiatives must take place
 abhi 97 pratishat saamaan 18 pratishat jiesti yaa usase neeche ke slab manen hai
 GST should be reduced on some other things
 18 pratishat se upar sirf non merit guds ko rakhana chahie, jaise alcohol, cigarette, lakjri or emported car aadi ko
 Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge presented the Interim Budget but there was so much noise in the House that no one could hear it
 yah vaaki shame kii baat he ki jab itane mahatv kii baat or ghoshnaaen kii ja rahi hon, us samay mutthi bhar sadsy arajak tatwon kii tarah shor machaa rahe the
 The amount of shame that he showed, ignoring the Speaker's insistence, is less condemned
 baharhaal rail mantri ne janata kii vaahvahee luutane kaa lobh sanvaran karte hue ek aisa bajet pesh kiya jisaki tarif kii ja sakati he
 He understood the fragile economic condition of the railway and did not make any proposal accordingly, which worsened the condition of the railway
 rail mantri ne kiraaye badhotaree ke maamle ke liye rail tarriff praadhikaran kii ghoshnaa karke aane vaale rail mantriyon kaa kaam aasaan kar diya kyonki ab kiraaye badhanaa yaa ghataana sidhe unke haath main na hokar praadhikaran ke paas hoga jo is babat samay-samay par siforishein karata rahegaa
 He has taken a major step by announcing the running of premium trains
 inase na keval atirikt trainen to chalengi lekin unke kiraaye saamaanya nahin honge balki ve maang-aapurti ke saral niyam par aadhaarit honge
 With this the Railways will have additional income, they will get the option according to the paying capacity of the passengers
 hawaii jahaajon kii tarah inke kiraaye ghatate-badhate rahenge
 Indian Railways is the largest employer in the country
 is par lakhon logon kii roji-roti tiki hui he
 It is important to make it financially strong
 pichley kuch samay se ham dekh rahe hai ki maal dhulaai main railway pichhadati ja rahi he
 The way the number of industries grew in the country, according to that the railways should have carried more cargo
 isse uski aarthik haalat behatar hoti lekin aisa nahin hua or yah sadak parivahan se muqabla kar nahin paa rahi he jo graahakon ko zyada priy he
 Its treatment appears very little in this budget
 railway ke liye yah bahut mahatvapurn he ki vah zyada se zyada maal dhoe or uskaa rajasav bade kyonki zyaadaatar yatri trainen to ghate main chalati hai
 The railway minister has increased the freight target but how successful he can be in his goal, it will tell the time to come
 darasal saamaan bhejne kii prakriya ko aasaan banane ke alaava unki samay par delivery bahut jaruri he, aisa hone par hi kaarobaari bade paimaane par railway se judenge
 Passenger safety has always been a big issue for the railways
 is baar ke bajet main is par koi khaas jor nahin dikhataa he
 This is a very big issue and the Railways should take all steps for this
 trainon kaa sahi samay par parichaalan or yatri suraksha do aise mudde hai jinamein kisi tarah kii kamobesh kii gunjaaish nahin he
 This railway budget can be appreciated in the sense that despite the election head on, the Railway Minister has not taken any step which can be called a pure populist
 (lekhak varisht patrkaar or 'aaj tak' ke sampadakeey salaahkaar hai) New Year is a chance and stars cannot do anything special

 His next film is 'tere Bin Laden-2'
 film main ek geet he, jisamen unhen special luk main najar aana he, jiske liye workout kii jarurat he
 Now some sacrifice is made for the film
 2ji ghotaale main kisi ke kilaaf koi saboot nahin mila he
 The CBI has not been able to produce any evidence against any accused in seven years to prove the charges
 saat saal tak chale is maamle main saadhe teen saal modi sarkaar ke hai
 The Supreme Court was monitoring this case
 iske baad bhi 2ji maamle main sibiai kisi ke kilaaf saboot pesh nahin kar pai he
 Special CBI Judge OP Saini has said that 2G scam has been given in listening for seven years with concentration, the CBI has not been able to present a single evidence before us
 jaj opi saini kaa puraa bayaan is tarah se pitiai ne chapa he
 
 
 'I also want to add that for almost seven years on all working days, including summer holidays, i used to sit in the open court from 10am to 5pm
 intazaar karata tha ki koi aisa saboot lekar aayega jise kanoonee taur sweekaar kiya ja sake lekin koi nahin aayaa
 ' yah baat zaruri he
 Before the original thing is lost in the political Tu Tu Main I, it is important to keep in mind that all the accused in that 2G scam have been acquitted in the 2G scam which created a political storm in the country
 zarur trial court kaa faisla he, magar jaanch supreme court kii nigaraanee main hui he, hai court ne jaj tay kiya tha
 The CBI has said that it will appeal in the High Court
 jaj opi saini kaa bayaan mahatvapurn he ki sibiai yaa koi bhi saboot hi pesh nahin kar paaya he
 Did the CAG give a wrong report at that time that the government treasury has been damaged by 1 lakh 76 thousand crores in the 2G case
 tab sara desh sann rah gaya tha ki paune do lakh karod kaa bhi ghotaalaa ho saktaa he
 Can there be such a big lapse with the CAG, then we have to question the CAG as well
 agar itani badi sanstha kii report kaa yah haal he to uski un report kaa kya karen jisamen wo nitiyon or lagu hone kii kamiyaan ginaata he
 1552 is a judgment of pages and the accused is not one, the evidence is not able to prove even one
 yah kaalpanik katha he yaa vaaki main aisa hua he
 In this case former Telecom Minister a Raja, former DMK MP Kanimoi Karunanidhi, Kanimozhi's mother and Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Amma, former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, a Raja's former private secretary RK Chandolia, Shahid Balwa, Surendra Pipara, Hari Nair, Gautam Doshi, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, Rajiv Aggarwal, Karim Morani, Sharad Kumar, Sanjay Chandra are all acquitted
 kisi ke khilaaf saboot hi nahin pesh kar pai sibiai
 14 people remained in jail for several months
 e raja ko istipha dena padaa tha
 After this decision, the statement of Mukul Rohatgi, former Solicitor General of Modi government is important
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha he ki aap jis bhi tarah se dekhie, aapraadhik maamla nahin banataa he
 The tornado that caused the loss of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores is not correct
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne mukul rohtagi se baat kii
 The 1 lakh 76 thousand crore scam figure was made on the CAG report when Vinod Rai was the CAG
 vinod raay ko modi sarkaar ne padam bhushan diya he, bank board beuro kaa chairman banaaya he or supreme court ne unhen bisisiai kii prashaskeey samiti main rakhaa he
 Whether Vinod Rai gave the wrong report, took the wrong advantage of trust in the institution, did the media get caught in the Vinod Rai report, this decision has proved all the history between 2011 and 2014 to be false
 sabake sab sawaalon ke kathghare main hai yahaan tak ki is jhooth par yakeen karne vaali janata bhi
 Vinod Rai also wrote a book after retiring from the post of CAG
 jiskaa tital tha Not just an accountant, the diary of the nation conciosukeeper, 21 disambar ke faisle ke sandarbh main kitaab kaa tital hi ulataa padhaa ja saktaa he, jaise vinod raay sirf lekhaakaar nahin the, kuch or the, or desh kii antaratma ke prahari kii diary, antaratma se jhooth bolne vaale kii diary lagati he
 Vinod Rai did not talk to anyone today
 phone se sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya magar saamne nahin aae
 At that time when there was talk of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores scam, then Congress leader and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal used to say zero loss while being a minister
 kapil sibbal kaa aaj tak mazaaq udata he ki jiro los kaha tha
 After the verdict, Sibal said that zero loss was proved right
 vinod raay ko sabhi padon se barkhaast kar diya janaa chahie, unhone puure desh se jhooth bolaa tha
 When there was no evidence, no accused even then what could have been such a big scam
 faisla aisa he ki saazish kii theory bhi kamazor pad jaati he, kya modi sarkaar ke rahete sibiai jaanboojh kar cese ko kamazor kar sakati he, kya modi sarkaar itnaa bada jokhim uthaa sakati he, ye sab sawaal hai
 This decision changed the character of the media
 anna andolan hua
 Anchors started asking questions to the country and people felt that there was no one in the country other than the anchor
 ek majboot netaa chahie jo bolne vaala ho
 Was it all built on the foundation of a lie
 2ji scam ke vakt tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 3 janvari 2014 ko media ke saath vishesh baatcheet kii jisamen kaha tha ki media se zyaada itihaas mere prati dayaalu rahegaa
 Is the talk of Manmohan Singh getting right, the man who used to laugh at everything about Manmohan Singh, what is happening today that his everything seems to be on target
 jaj opi saini ne apane faisle main ek or baat kahi he
 Not a single person came
 yah ishaara karata he ki har koi us dharna se prabhavit tha jo afvaah, gapp or atakalbaaziyon ke aadhaar par banaai gai thi
 Rumors have no place in judicial processes
 bijepi maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki 2ji spectrum ghotaalaa nahin hua tha
 The same statement is being made by the party and the government that the policies were framed in a corrupt way
 vitt mantri jetali kah rahe hai ki sieji kii report ke aadhaar par supreme court ne aavanton radd kiya tha
 But Judge OP Saini has said in his judgment that not a single evidence was presented and the assumption was made on the basis of rumors
 congress aakraamak he
 She is seeking cleanliness from Prime Minister Modi
 purv sieji vinod raay ke kilaaf karrwai kii maang kar rahi he
 p Chidambaram has said that the UPA government was demolished by spreading rumors of a false scam
 anand sharma ne kaha he ki jhooth kii buniyaad par bhrashtachar virdohi andolan chalaa
 The Congress government also passed the Lokpal Act, but it has been more than three years, the process of appointing the Lokpal has not started
 2G ghotaale kii baat ne desh kii telecom industry ko lambey samay ke liye tabah kar diya
 This employment sector became a layoffs sector
 license radd hue
 Thousands of people lost their jobs in this sector
 kya iskaa sambandh tamilandu kii raajnneeti se bhi he
 Recently, Prime Minister went to his house to know DMK chief Karunanidhi's condition
 kya is faisle ke baad bijepi diemke ko apane paale main le legi, kya ek gathbandhan ke liye itnaa bada siyaasi daanv chalaa ja saktaa he, tamilnadu main gathbandhan hoga to desh main sawaal nahin uthegaa ki 2ji ghotaale ke aaropee kahaan hai, wo bijepi ke saath kyon hai, wo bari kyon ho gaye
 An anecdote was created on the basis of lies
 kya sab kuch itnaa saral hota he ki pradhanmantri diemke se gathbandhan kar len or idhar 2ji ghotaale main uske netaaon ko chhudvaa den
 Why would the Prime Minister want to put his anti-corruption image at stake
 aane vaale dinon main dekhie ki diemke kii raajnneeti kis taraf jaati he, unki taraf koun jaataa he
 Judge OP Saini has written this matter in his Judgment
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki jo kamiyaan rah gayi hai ham unka bachaav karenge
 Our main plea was not considered
 jaj opi saini ne daleel kii baat nahin kahi he, kaha he ki sibiai koi bhi saboot pesh nahin kar pai
 The CBI says that their written evidence was not adhered to
 rajaneta chhot gaye
 Industrialists missed out
 saat saal kii sunwaayee kaa yahi parinaam niklaa he ki koi saboot nahin he
 The scam has not happened
 hoicourt main apil ke naam par kya isaki aag par siyaasi roti senki ja sakati he
 This matter goes beyond the purview of the court
 desh ko pataa chalanaa chahie ki hua kya tha
 For what purpose was the CAG report made, whether the DMK and the industrialists were taken aback at the level of investigation to give relief
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad vivek tankhaa ne sawaal kiya he ki sieji kii report kaise li hui kisi ko pataa nahin, jis report ko sansad main rakhaa janaa tha, magar iske pehle hi report li kar di gai
 When there is no evidence, the accused have escaped, then which scam is being talked about
 hoicourt main apil kii baat ho rahi he, 30 disambar 2014 ko soharabuddin phek encounter maamle main amit shah special sibiai court se bari hue to aaj tak apil file nahin he
 December 2017 is going to come
 kya sibiai kisi se puch kar apil kaa faisla karti he
 Is this a transparent and fair system? hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apni report main faisle ke bare main kuch anya baaten bhi likhi hai, jaj ne likhaa he ki telecom mahakme kii baat kisi ne nahin suni
 Everyone accepted that it was a big scam whereas it was not
 tippaniyan The court's comment about the CBI is interesting
 jaj opi saini ne likhaa he ki sibiai ne is cese kii badi acchhee koreography kii
 There is no record or evidence that proves the crime
 aarope patr main aadhikarik dastavezon kii galat or sandarbh se hat kar vyakhya kii gai he
 The chargesheet was filed on the basis of oral testimony of the witnesses
 jabaki court main gavaahon ne yah sab nahin kaha
 Many facts in the charge sheet are incorrect
 abhiyojan paksh aarope patr sabit karne main naakaam rahaa
 This comment by Judge OP Saini should be a matter of concern for everyone
 kya itnaa aasaan he jhootha cese gadhana or jhuthe aaropon main kisi ko jail bhejnaa or ek rashtriya andolan khadaa kar dena
 Will everything prove to be a lie? bahut kuch daanv par laga he
 This CBI accused the then Telecom Minister a Raja of taking bribe of 200 crores
 jo diemke saansad kanimoi ke tivi channel ke zarie di gai thi
 Both A
 Raja and Kanimoi were acquitted
 saat saal se jaanch ho rahi he, special jaj rose sabooton kaa intazaar karte rahe, saboot nahin aae

 hoicourt main apil ke naam par kya isaki aag par siyaasi roti senki ja sakati he
 This matter goes beyond the purview of the court
 desh ko pataa chalanaa chahie ki hua kya tha
 For what purpose was the CAG report made, whether the DMK and the industrialists were taken aback at the level of investigation to give relief
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad vivek tankhaa ne sawaal kiya he ki sieji kii report kaise li hui kisi ko pataa nahin, jis report ko sansad main rakhaa janaa tha, magar iske pehle hi report li kar di gai
 When there is no evidence, the accused have escaped, then which scam is being talked about
 hoicourt main apil kii baat ho rahi he, 30 disambar 2014 ko soharabuddin phek encounter maamle main amit shah special sibiai court se bari hue to aaj tak apil file nahin he
 December 2017 is going to come
 kya sibiai kisi se puch kar apil kaa faisla karti he
 Is this a transparent and fair system? hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apni report main faisle ke bare main kuch anya baaten bhi likhi hai, jaj ne likhaa he ki telecom mahakme kii baat kisi ne nahin suni
 Everyone accepted that it was a big scam whereas it was not
 tippaniyan The court's comment about the CBI is interesting
 jaj opi saini ne likhaa he ki sibiai ne is cese kii badi acchhee koreography kii
 There is no record or evidence that proves the crime
 aarope patr main aadhikarik dastavezon kii galat or sandarbh se hat kar vyakhya kii gai he
 The chargesheet was filed on the basis of oral testimony of the witnesses
 jabaki court main gavaahon ne yah sab nahin kaha
 Many facts in the charge sheet are incorrect
 abhiyojan paksh aarope patr sabit karne main naakaam rahaa
 This comment by Judge OP Saini should be a matter of concern for everyone
 kya itnaa aasaan he jhootha cese gadhana or jhuthe aaropon main kisi ko jail bhejnaa or ek rashtriya andolan khadaa kar dena
 Will everything prove to be a lie? bahut kuch daanv par laga he
 This CBI accused the then Telecom Minister a Raja of taking bribe of 200 crores
 jo diemke saansad kanimoi ke tivi channel ke zarie di gai thi
 Both A
 Raja and Kanimoi were acquitted
 saat saal se jaanch ho rahi he, special jaj rose sabooton kaa intazaar karte rahe, saboot nahin aae
 This is important
 isse pehle kii raajnneetik tu tu main main main mul baat kho jaae, is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana zaruri he ki jis 2ji ghotaale ko lekar desh main ek raajnneetik tufaan machaa, us 2ji ghotaale main sabhi aaropee bari ho gaye hai
 Surely the trial court has decided, but the investigation has been done under the supervision of the Supreme Court, the High Court had decided the judge
 sibiai ne kaha he ki hoicourt main apil karegi
 The statement of Judge OP Saini is significant that the CBI has not been able to present any evidence
 kya us vakt sieji ne galat report di thi ki 2ji maamle main sarkari khazaane ko 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod kaa nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he
 Then the whole country was stunned that even a quarter of a million rupees could be scammed
 kya sieji se itani badi chook ho sakati he, phir to hamen sieji ko lekar bhi sawaal karnaa hoga
 If this is the condition of the report of such a large organization, then what should be done of those reports in which it counts the shortcomings of policies and implementation
 1552 pannon kaa jajment he or aaropee ek bhi nahin, saboot ek bhi sabit karne laayak nahin
 Is it a fictional story or indeed it has happened
 is maamle main purv telikam mantri e raja, purv diemke saansad kanimoi karunanidhi, kanimoi kii maa or karunanidhi kii patni dayaalu ammaa, purv doorsanchaar sachiv siddharth behura, e raja ke purv nijee sachiv aarake chandoliya, shahid balava, surendra pipaara, hari nair, gautam doshi, vinod goyanka, asif balava, rajeev agarwal, kareem morani, sharad kumaar, sanjay chandra ye sabake sab bari ho gaye hai
 CBI could not present evidence against anyone
 14 log kai maheene tak jail main rahe
 A
 Raja had to resign
 is faisle ke baad modi sarkaar ke purv solisitor general mukul rohtagi kaa bayaan mahatvapurn he
 Mukul Rohatgi has said that whichever way you look, criminal case is not made
 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke nuksaan kaa jo bavandar paidaa kiya gaya vah sahi nahin he
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava spoke to Mukul Rohatgi
 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke ghotaale kaa aankada sieji report par bana tha jab vinod raay sieji the
 Vinod Rai has been given the Padma Bhushan by the Modi government, appointed chairman of the bank board bureau and the Supreme Court has placed him on the bcci's administrative committee
 kya vinod raay ne galat report di, sanstha ke prati bharose kaa galat laabh uthaaya, kya media vinod raay kii report ke jhaanse main aa gaya, is faisle ne 2011 se 2014 ke bich ke saare itihaas ko hi jhootha sabit kar diya he
 Everyone is in the dock of questions, even the people who believe this lie
 vinod raay ne sieji pad se ritair hone ke baad ek kitaab bhi likhi
 Whose title was Not just an accountant, the diary of the nation conciosukeeper, the title of the book can only be read in the context of the December 21 decision, as Vinod Rai was not just an accountant, something else, and the conscience of the nation's conscience
 The diary seems to be a diary of the conscience
 vinod raay ne aaj kisi se baat nahin kii
 An attempt was made to contact the phone but did not appear
 us vakt jab 1 lakh 76 hazaar karod ke ghotaale kii baat hoti thi tab congress netaa or senior vakil kapil sibbal mantri rahete hue zero los kaha karte the
 To date Kapil Sibal jokes that what was called zero loss
 faisle ke baad sibbal ne kaha ki zero los vaali baat sahi sabit hui
 Vinod Rai should be dismissed from all posts, he lied to the whole country
 jab saboot nahin, koi aaropee nahin tab bhi kya itnaa bada ghotaalaa ho saktaa tha
 The decision is such that the theory of intrigue also weakens, can the CBI deliberately weaken the case under the Modi government, can the Modi government take such a big risk, these are all questions
 is faisle ne media kaa charitra badal diya
 Anna movement took place
 ankar desh se sawaal poochne lage or logon ko laga ki ankar ke alaava desh main koi he hi nahin
 a strong leader is needed to speak
 kya yah sab ek jhooth kii buniyaad par khadaa kiya gaya
 During the 2G scam, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a special conversation with the media on 3 January 2014, in which he said that history will be kinder to me than media
 kya manmohan singh kii baat sahi hoti ja rahi he, jis manmohan singh kii har baat par hansi udati thi, aaj aisa kya ho rahaa he ki unki har baat nishane par lagati nazar aati he
 Judge OP Saini has said one more thing in his decision
 ek bhi vyakti nahin aayaa
 This indicates that everyone was influenced by the notion that it was based on rumor, gossip and speculation
 nyaayik prakriyaaon main afvaahon kii koi jagah nahin he
 The BJP is not willing to believe that the 2G spectrum scam was not done
 party or sarkaar kii taraf se yahi bayaan diya ja rahaa he ki nitiyon ko bhrasht tareeke se banaaya gaya tha
 Finance Minister Jaitley is saying that the Supreme Court had canceled the allocation based on the CAG report

 Will the BJP take the DMK into its fold after this decision, can such a big political bet be for an alliance, if there is an alliance in Tamil Nadu, then there will be no question in the country that where are the accused in the 2G scam, they are with the BJP Why are they, why are they acquitted
 kya jhooth ke aadhaar par ek kissa gadha gaya
 Is everything so simple that the Prime Minister should tie up with the DMK and get rid of its leaders in the 2G scam here? pradhanmantri bhrashtachar virdohi apni chhavi daanv par kyon lagaana chahenge
 In the coming days, see which way DMK politics goes, who goes to them

 bharat ke khilaaf karaari haar se ke baad pakistan cricket team ko na sirf maidan par balki soshal media par bhi nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 In the Asia Cup, India recorded Pakistan's biggest win, beating them by 9 wickets, after which the top batsman Babar Azampak became the target of cricket lovers
 darasal, pakistan ke ballebazfakhar jamalbatting karte hue pich par phisal gaye or unhen LBW qaraar diya gaya
 But Babar Azam, standing on a non-strike, refused to take him for a review
 haalanki baad main saaf hua ki fakhar out nahin the or ball unke haath main lagi thi
 Pakistan's wicket would not have fallen if Babur had advised them for a review
 fakhar 31 ran banaakar out qaraar die gaye
 Terrible advice by Babar Azam to Fakhar not to take the review even though Fakhar would have survived
 He then gets out by a meter and takes the review for himself
 This is atrocious conduct

 Earlier, he added 31 runs for the second wicket with Fakhar Jamal
 agar in donon kii jodi kuch over maidan par jam jaati to pakistan kii aisi haalat na hoti
 This is the reason that the Pakistani fans on social media are telling Babar the villain of this defeat and also consider him responsible for dropping 2 wickets
 Yesterday Imam ul Haq and today Babar Azam advised Fakhar not to take review
 Both proved wrong
 Who is coaching them on this

 Ashok Gehlot recently completed four years as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 yah unka doosraa kaarykaal he
 His first term was between 1998 and 2003, after which he lost to Vasundhara Raje of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 9 saal ke apane raajnneetik anubhav or sonia gandhi ke laadle mukhyamantri hone ke baavjood unke raaj main prashasan kitna badahaal he, iskaa udhaaharan pichley kuch dinon hui ghatnaayen hai
 Gehlot is now feeling burdened by Gandhi

 He admits that he hardly knows Gandhi
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki unhen marwar yaa rajasthan kaa gandhi kahkar na bulaayaa jaae
 Today, Gehlot has been promoted as a leader who is accused of allowing companies of his close friends to make a lot of money, including concessions in laws to build land, lakes, apartments, water and sewer pipelines and solar In energy projects, arbitrary contracts etc
 are punished in the plots and all this is done at the expense of the public's hard earned money and government land

 Since then, many contradictions have emerged in this incident
 yah ghatana dikhaati he ki gahalot prashasan main police kitni aksham, or gaiyr-peshewar he
 Gehlot also has a home ministry, with the police directly under his control
 7 saal kii bacchee naina kii hatya kii jimmedaari bhi prashasan par aati he jise uske ghar se agava kar liya gaya tha
 The responsibility of cutting both hands of Pappu Sharma in Karauli district is also on Gehlot, who is celebrating the completion of four years in power

 In Mumbai, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided companies linked to bullion traders on Saturday
 idi ne yahaan chaar companiyon par chapa maaraa
 Among the alleged companies, there has been talk of sending 69 crore rupees through bogus companies
 8 november yani notebandi ke elaan ke baad in chaar companiyon main 69 karod rupee bheje gaye the
 This amount was given to buy gold
 idi adhikariyon ko shaq he ki yah rakam kalaadhan tha, jise safed karne ke liye bogus companiyon ke jariye kathith chaaron companiyon ko bheja gaya tha
 In view of the action, the ED has freezed more than one crore rupees from an account of the company
 idi is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki notebandi ke baad in khaaton main paisa kahaan se jamaa karavaaya gaya
 At the same time, ED is also investigating the transactions of account holder companies with bogus companies
 adhikariyon kii maane to bogus companiyon ke jariye 150 karod rupee kekaledhanako safed karne kii koshish kii gai he

 dilli gangrape ke ek aaropee ko adaalat ne naaballig maan liya he
 The court has determined the age of the accused based on the register shown by the principal of the school
 ye vahi naaballig he jis par ladki se sabase zyada vahashiana harakat karne ke aarope hai
 This whole incident has given rise to a big debate whether the age limit of child criminals should be reduced by 18 years in the law
 kya bal aparaadhon main bhi rer of di reerest kaa praavdhaan hona chahie
 The person whose handiwork was the most disgusting in the Delhi gangrape would be punished the least
 jis ladke ne peedit ladki ke saath sabase zyada barbataa kii use zyada se zyada teen saal kii sajaa ho sakati he
 In the face of the most brutal culprit of the rape scandal that has rocked the whole country, the law also seems helpless today
 police or puri kanoon vyavastha ab chaah kar bhi use uske gunahon ke laayak sajaa nahin de sakati, kyonki dilli kii adaalat main ye sabit ho gaya he ki uski umr 18 saal se kam thi
 On 16 December, the date on which the boy shook the soul of the whole country with his cruel antics, his age was 17 years, 6 months and 12 days
 yani 5 maheene or 18 din kii kanoon kii is majaburi ne use aisi maholat di he, jisase wo apane sabase khunkhaar aparaadh se mahaj teen saal kii sajaa kaat kar batch nikalegaa
 According to the case prepared by Delhi Police, this 6th accused had called the victim girl and her friend to sit in the bus on the night of 16 December
 isi ladke ne us ladki ke saath do baar balaatkaar kiya
 Not only this, the second time he raped the girl when she was unconscious
 phir isi naaballig ne un donon ko bas se baahar phenkane ko kaha tha
 All these claims of the Delhi Police and the crimes of the minor accused have also been confirmed by the victim's friend in the bus
 16 disambar kii ghatana ke baad se hi puure desh main ek badi bahes shuru ho gayi thi
 Should the juvenile justice act reduce the age limit for minor offenders? Should the Juvenile Justice Act also have a provision for Rare of the Reverend crimes so that minors can be punished severely in such cases? After the December 16 incident, the Justice Verma Committee, formed to enact stringent laws on rape, has also given its recommendations
 
 justise verma is haq main nahin ki naaballigon kii umr seemaa kam kii jaani chahie
 Statistics from the National Crime Bureau show that 65 percent of minors involved in crime are between 16 and 18 years old
 neshnal krime beuro ke aankade or 16 disambar kii vaardaat ne, desh main is vakt nai bahes ched di he kya aise ghinaune aparaadh main shaamil naaballigon ko sachmuch naaballig mana janaa chahie

" ’students ke skool se zyada koching par dhyaan dene kii vajah yah he ki ejineering kii pravesh pariksha kaksha 12veen class kii pariksha se ekadam alag hoti he
 The institutes took advantage of this opportunity and contracted the schools

 Instead, they start preparing for engineering and go to school at the time of 12th class examination

 Harsh Mishra of New Speed institute says that the coaching for engineering and medical entrance examinations in Kanpur is much cheaper than the quota of Rajasthan, the second largest center in North India
 ve kehete hai, ‘kanpur main enginiinrag ke ek subject kii koching fees 15,000 ru

 a day earlier on Monday, the family of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan Abhay Mishra, who was killed in an Naxalite attack in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh, was dependent on him
 shahid abhaya ke pita ko desh ke liye ladate hue bete ke marane kaa dard to nahin he, lekin vah is baat se dukhi hai ki unka betaa 'apane hi logon' se ladate hue mara
 Abhay's father Bihar resident Gajendra Mishra said he would have been more proud if his son had been a martyr while fighting enemies on the border
 bihar kii rajdhani patna se 80 kilometre pashchim kii ore sthit tulsi harigaanv main sthit shahid abhaya ke pita ne kisi tarah aansuon par kaabo pate hue kaha, "yah dukhad he ki meraa betaa apane logon se ladate hue shahid hua

 Amit said, "I want to join the army to serve the country
 desh ke liye hi jeena or maranaa chahta hum
 "amit also revealed that about a month and a half ago, his brother Abhay suffered a thigh injury, but he was not allowed to go home
 amit ne kaha, "bhaiya kii jaangh main jab goli lagi thi, tab maine unase baat kii thi
 But he could not be discharged and he was admitted to a hospital in Raipur
 " Martyr Abhay's father Gajendra said that the government's anti-naxal strategy has not been successful and that jawans like his son have been easy targets of Naxalites
 gajendra aashcharya vyakt karte hue kehete hai ki suraksha bal ke javaanon ko atyaadhunik hathiyaar or naksalwadiyon kii tulana main kahin adhik sankhya main die gaye hai, iske baavjood naksalwadi itani badi sankhya main javaanon kii hatya karne main kaise kaamyaab rahe, vah bhi tab jab muthbhed teen ghante tak chali
 The comments vah sawalia lahaze main kehete hai ki agar america 'pakistan main ghuskar' osama bin laden ko maar saktaa he or bharat sargical strike kar saktaa he, phir hamaare suraksha balon ko naksalwadiyon par unke ilaake main ghuskar hamalaa karne kii ijaajat kyon nahin he? unhone kaha ki unhen naksalwadiyon ke khilaaf sarkaar kii ranneeti par khaas bharosa nahin he

 Martyr Abhay's father Gajendra said that the son's death has shaken the whole family, despite Abhay's younger brother Amit not giving up the dream of joining the force

 ) rahul gandhi kii masihaai chhavi ubhaarne ke liye congress ne haryana ke sonipat sthit gannaur main somvaar ko ek political stant rachaa
 Rahul, who came to talk to the farmers, first gave a long speech, which was more or less the same as his earlier speeches
 iske baad jab sawaal-jawaab kaa round aayaa to mike gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne tham liya or pratinidhiyon ko mauka dene ke bajaay khud hi sawaal poochne lage
 For example, Jayaram asked the first question regarding Bhatta Parsaul incident and land acquisition
 jawaab main rahul ne bhavukta kii chaashni main lagbhag vahi baat kahi jo kai manchon par vah pehle bhi kah chuke hai
 Keeping the vision of democratizing the party in front, he said that in the next 5 years he wants to make the Congress such a party where workers and peasants will choose the electoral candidates, not the party leadership
 unhone kaha ki unhone kisaanon se jo siikhaa he, vah beurocrates nahin sikhaa pate
 The Congress vice president accused former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior BJP leader LK Advani of ridiculing his father Rajiv Gandhi
 unhone kaha, 'mere pita desh main computer lekar aae to senior bijepi netaaon vaajapeyi ji or adwani ji ne 'computer bvoy' kahkar unka majaak udaaya
 Later Pramod Mahajan started giving credit to BJP
 lekin aaj aapaki jeb main mobile phone he to yah mere pita kii soch kii vajah se hi he
 'rahul said that we want to give you (farmers) a choice, not an order
 aadesh dena bijepi kaa kaam he
 Attacking the opposition party, he advocated decentralization of power
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kii soch he ki ek vyakti hi desh chalaa saktaa he, jabaki congress hindustan kii janata ko takat dena chaahati he
 MNREGA, RTI and Panchayati Raj are examples of this
 congress upaadhyaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi congress kii uplabdhiyon ko apana banaakar pesh karti he
 Without naming Modi, he said that the opposition party is also trying to take Sardar Patel into his court
 padhie rahul gandhi or kya bole, unheen kii jubaani:kitne log yahaan apane beton ko khet main kaam karte dekhnaa chaahate hai? koi nahin chahta na
 So what is our thinking
 ham aapse ye nahin kahana chaahate hai ki bhai, aapke beton ko kheti nahin kerani chahie
 That is your decision
 ham aapako ye sirf ye kahana chaahate hai ki opshan aapke haath main hona chahie
 There is no money in farming
 ghate kaa sauda he
 So the first task is ours, which i talked about land
 jameen banaao to isamen suraksha mili aapako
 But do not want to stop there
 ham kehete hai ki aapke beton ko vahi mauka hona chahie, jo baaki logon ko he
 Where will it come from? rojgaar se aegi or kis prakaar ke rojgaar se aegi
 Service and manufacturing
 to hamane pichley paanch-saat saal main ye mumbai minufekcharing coridor kii baat kii
 Delhi mumbai mumbai-chennai
 Dedicated Railway Freight Corridor
 hamane network taiyaar kar diya he
 Now it will take up industries and your children will get the choice
 hamaari raajnneeti aapako chois dene kii he
 No ordering vah bijepi kaa kaam he
 We want that India should use its power
 raajnneeti kii baat hoti he
 Hooda ji and Jairam Ramesh ji are sitting
 kaaphi shikaayat aati he
 a complaint comes about Jairam ji that the brothers do not listen to the minister
 to problem kya he
 Talk of tickets arose from two or three places
 cabinet main tikat vitaran main kisaan nahin dikhaai dete
 You do not have a stake in that
 jab tak hamane isko nahin badla, tab tak ham aise hi baaten kar sakate hai
 i have been in politics for 10 years
 aawaaj daalane ke liye shakti kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 Until we put you in the ticket process, power cannot come
 isliye 15 siton main hamane logon se poochkar tikat dene kaa kaam kiya
 It is my thinking that a day should come when such a meeting is sure, when it comes to the ticket, your line should be put
 kisaanon kii, mazdooron kii, aajkal kya hota he, hooda ji or main or jairam ji tikat chunate hai
 Hooda ji is smiling
 main bhi muskura rahaa hum
 But a day should come when farmers should be chosen, workers should be chosen
 or empi sahab baithe hai, to unhen lage ki bhaiya kaam nahin kar rahaa, to dabaav pade
 Anyone in public: In how many years it will happen? Rahul: i will do it in five to seven years
 meraa problem aapako samajhnaa he
 These decisions are not easy
 hooda ji bhi aapako bataa denge
 People get angry in this
 udhaas ho jate hai
 Sounds loud
 main kahata hum aap log chuno
 If you look at all the political parties
 bijepi, congress, left ko dekhen
 In India, we talk about corruption
 bahut log hai, jo apana bhaashan dete hai
 Just give a speech
 main problem he ki hindustan ko loksabhaa or vidhansabha main badlaav laane honge
 Talk about 50% women
 ye kisaanon kii meeting he
 How many people are there in this meeting
 400 log hai
 But look over there
 chaar-aath mahilaayein
 a day should come when 50 per cent of the women are shown and 50 per cent when we call the farmers' meeting
 main karuunga bhaiya
 i will magar main point kya he
 i am speaking to you for a long time that you have information in India
 kisaan ke paas he
 The workers have
 badhai ke paas he
 Women have
 magar ham aapse poochhate nahin
 The system tells you
 main chahta hum ki congress party main ham aapse poochna shuru karen
 Sometimes we will not like it
 magar ham puuchhenge
 This is the difference between us and the BJP
 bijepi main ye soch he ki ye desh ek vyakti chalaa saktaa he
 a person has complete knowledge of the world
 kheti ke bare main vah jaanata he
 Knows about airplanes
 soch kya he ki power centrulij karo
 We say the opposite, give power to the people of India
 manaregaa
 RTI, Panchayati Raj are examples of this
 aap sab aae, bahut bahut dhanyavad
 Jairam Ramesh: Sit for a minute
 aise nahin chalegaa
 Rahul ji will leave
 aap shant ho jaaie
 You sit down
 dekhie abhi abhi rahul ji ne apni soch or vichaar aapke saamne rakhaa
 Rahul ji is present here
 kisaan se sambandhit muddon ko praathamikta deni chahie, us par charchaa ho rahi he
 Mike is in my hand
 main rahul ji se sidhe do sawaal poochna chahta hum
 You went to Bhatta Parsaul
 kya soch rahi aapaki
 You said, the Land Acquisition Act has to change
 aapaki kya soch rahi?rahul:sirf bhatta parsul nahin
 Is visible in Niyamgiri and throughout India
 kisaan kii jameen thi
 And there was no power in his hand
 upi main maine dekha
 The government used to order one day, disappeared the other day
 kahi formula van trek bana diya
 It can be used once a year
 wo bhi bhaiya aapane dekha kaise chal rahaa he
 Maybe even close in two to three years
 dekhie kitne kisaanon kii jameen ek minute main, bhaiya formula van dekhnaa he
 Carts will circle
 jameen le lo, to nyaay hona chahie
 If someone lives in Delhi
 to usko ham kehete hai ki agar jameen bechnaa chaahate ho, to bech do
 But when the farmer has the land that if we want to take your land, then we can take it
 aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 The method is also wrong
 bhatta parsul main gaya
 The woman was crying there
 poocha kya hua
 Said, come one day and said the land is not yours
 kuch likhaa nahin
 Those who were given land, they came and said that this land is not yours
 main samaj gaya
 You must have felt sad wo boli nahin duusare kaaran se dukh hua
 i had a crop on the ground
 maine kaha ki mujhe ye fasal nikaalane do
 He went and burnt the crop
 ab dekho, ye soch he
 That we will not just suppress it, but we will finish it
 ye badalanaa he
 i want to say about Niyamgiri
 bhaiya ye kisaan kii baat nahin he
 Take away what is weak
 agar majboot aadmi he, paisa he to chin saktaa he
 Against him kamjor aadmi majboot ke saamne jaakar kahe, ye meraa adhikaar he, tum nahin kar sakate
 What is Vedanta niamgiri main kya he
 What used to happen before
 jairam:emensi thi
 Previously it used to lift bauxite from the ground rahul:kiskaa he ye (boxite)
 What people were saying in Niyamgiri
 main gaya vahaan
 They said look
 ye hamaara dharm he
 If you want to take these mountains, then ask the panchayats
 vahaan bina puche le rahe the
 When asked the panchayats, they said that we do not want to give
 ham nahin chaahate ki aadha hindustan roe or aadha majboot ho
 Jairam Ramesh: Rahul ji, you gathered 10 lakh women in the women's savings group
 ye chota kaam nahin he
 We have not had a state government there for 25 years
 par 40 jilo main kareeb ek lakh mahila bachat samoohon ko ikattha kar bainkon se jodna
 i want to ask you aapane ye kiya kyon
 They are absolutely silent
 rahul:ye kehete hai baat kyon nahin karte
 i do not want to do why not
 log do tarah ke hote hai
 One that works, the other talks
 maine papa se kaha
 You work all day
 bolte kyon nahin
 He said, work will speak
 or aaj, kal maine bhaashan diya
 You have a phone in your pocket, this mobile phone, this is what they put in your pocket
 bijepi ke sabase senior netaa, vaajapeyi ji, adwani ji
 What was their top leaders at that time
 computer boy kaa naam diya 
 Joked and gave speeches about what would happen to the computer, ruined, jobs would end and then 15 years later, when the worker left
 wo log khadey hue or pramod mahajan ji ne kaha ki computer kaa kaam hamane kiya
 Look see, Sardar Patel was picked up
 aane vaale samay main kahenge ki bhojan kaa adhikaar, manaregaa, ye bhi hamaari soch thi
 i talk less about it
 aapane kaha, maine bada kaam kiya he
 i got to learn from women
 main chahta hum ki meri jindagi main aisa vakt aae, jab loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon main aadhi mahilaayein hon

 com / ri2bow5tbf — Riteish Deshmukh (@riteishd) December 16, 2019 bijepi ne kaha he ki sibiai nideshak dwaara daayar halafname se yah saaf ho jaataa he ki kanoonmantri ashvini kumaar ne report ke saath chhedchhad kii
 The BJP demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister and the coal minister, saying that an attempt was made to influence a fair probe into the scam and it is extremely important to know what the real status report of the CBI was
 court ko pichley maheene di apni report main sibiai ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne companiyon ke vittiya or duusare ricards ko sahi se nahin dekha tha, jis vajah se sarkaar ko iske license bantwaare main ghaataa hua
 The problems of the government are also because the Prime Minister himself had charge of the coal ministry during the time when this is the case
 court ko pichley maheene di apni report main sibiai ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne companiyon ke vittiya or duusare ricards ko sahi se nahin dekha tha, jis vajah se sarkaar ko iske license bantwaare main ghaataa hua
 The problems of the government are also because the Prime Minister himself had charge of the coal ministry during the time when this is the case
 bijepi shasit rajyon kaa mukhyamantri hone ke alaava anandiben patel, devendra fadanvis, manohar laal khatter, vasundhara raaje, shivaraj singh chouhan or raman singh ke bich ek or badi samanta he
 Together, they have started playing an active role in derailing the discussion of Good Governance and Progressive Politics which started after the Modi government came to power
 darasal, rajyon ko nai gavarnence kaa sutaradhar hona chahie tha, ve achaanak modi model kii sabase kamjor kadi ban rahe hai
 In the tenure of its current tenure of the Congress, the BJP was desperately seeking coordination with the states
 dashakon baad pehali baar aisa hua, jab 11 rajyon main us gathbandhan kii sarkaar hai jo centre main bahumat ke saath sarkaar chalaa rahaa he
 It is not only about political coordination, but on the scale of development prospects, Modi probably has the best team
 rajyon main vikaas ke pichley aankadon or maujuuda suvidhaon ko aadhaar banaate hue maikenji ne apane ek adhyayan main rajyon kii vikaas kii kshamtaaon ko aanka he
 The 12 states of the country (delhi, Chandigarh, Goa, Puducherry, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal, Kerala, Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand) handle 50 percent of the country's GDP, with 58 percent of the country's consumers
 in 12 rajyon main paanch main bijepi or sahyogi dalon kii sarkaar desh kaa lagbhag 25 fisad jidipi sambhaal rahi hai
 Including the seven states (andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Bengal, Odisha) that come next on the list of sharp prospects, the BJP and its allies in nine major states and about 40 percent GDP of the country in 19 Referred to the government of the parties
 maikenji ne aage jaakar 40 fisadi jidipi sanbhaalane vaale 65 shahari jilon ko bhi pahachaanaa he
 a large number of these also belong to local governments controlled by the BJP
 adarsh sthiti main yah vikaas kii sabase acchhee bisaat honi chahie thi
 At least with the help of these states, industry clusters and urban districts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious campaign should have hit the ground, but in the last 15 months, these states have left no stone unturned in the agenda of Good Governance
 madhya pradesh main har kursi ke neeche ghotaalaa nikalataa he
 The Maharashtra government started with scams and made sanctions a governance
 haryana main vikaas kii charchaaen paabandiyon or skulon main gita padhaane jaisi uplabdhiyon main badal gai hai
 Interestingly, even though the states may not have paid attention to the new beginnings of the Center, it did not delay in adopting the model of the Center in large publicity campaigns
 udyogpatiyon ke saath pradhanmantri kii taaja baithak main yah baat ubhari ki kaarobaar ko sahaj karne ke abhiyaan rajyon kii dahalij par dam tod rahe hai
 The campaign to make industrial and business clearances easy and outright has been backward
 vitt mantri arun jetali ko kahana padaa ki kaarobaar ko sahaj bananaa ek hameshaa chalane vaali prakriya he jabaki mek in india kii shuruyaat karte samay sarkaar ne sabhi manzooriyon ko ekamusth karne ke liye ek saal kaa samay rakhaa tha
 Central government officials are now asking for at least three years for this, just because others are left, BJP ruled states also did not give this campaign
 mek in india hi nahin, mandi kanoon badalane ko lekar bijepi ke apane hi rajyon ne centre kii nahin suni
 States are cold on Digital India
 adarsh gram or swatchta mishan jaise abhiyaanon main camera parasti chhaviyon ke alaava rajyon kii sakriyata nahin he
 Instead of decisions on administrative reforms, disinvestment of state undertakings and increased transparency, states have chosen models of increased government control and populist schemes that match the expectations of investors and the younger population
 modi sarkaar ne is saal ke bajet ke saath shiksha, swasthya, gramin vikaas, nagar vikaas jaisi saamaajik sevaaon kii jimmedaari puri tarah rajyon ko saunp di or centre ko keval sansaadhan aavanton tak simit kar liya
 As a result, the biggest void is seen in 15 months in areas like education, health, food security
 saamaajik sevaaon main centre paroksh bhoomika nibhaana chahta he jabaki rajyon ke paas sansadhano kii nahin balki nitigat kshamtaaon kii kami he
 Therefore development and expansion of capacities in education, health, rural development has lagged behind
 bijepi ke netaa bhi maan rahe hai ki shiksha or swasthya jaisi jaruraton ko puri tarah rajyon par chhodie ke rajnatik nuksaan hone vaale hai
 State governments formed before and after Modi came to power are falling short of expectations, while some large states are either marginalized in relations with the Center or are beginning preparations for elections
 puure desh main kareeb das pramukh rajya aise hai jinaki sarkaron ke paas samay, sansaadhan or sambhaavnaaen maujuud hai or inamen adhikansh bijepi va unke sahyogi dalon kii hai
 It is these who are responsible for decorating the "india" brand and campaigns, but these governments have given rise to variety of restrictions and important decisions
 chunavi raajnneeti kaa koi ant nahin he
 The 2016 election schedule is much larger than this year
 pradhanmantri ko chunavi raajnneeti se alag apni gavarnence ke model ko nae sire se feet karnaa hoga or rajyon ko badi va thos yojanaon se baandhna hoga nahin to bihar chunaav kaa nateeja chaahe jo ho, lekin agar rajya sarkarein chukin to nivesh, vikaas or rojgaar kii ranneetiyaan buree tarah ulti pad jaaengi
