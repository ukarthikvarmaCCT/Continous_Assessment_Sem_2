 dilli main ek bhayanak haadasa hua, kachare kaa pahaad maut banakar dilli kii ek sadak par tut padaa
 The lives of two people were buried in the garbage heap, but the threat posed by the garbage is not limited to breaking the mountain, the poison of this garbage is dissolving in the air of Delhi and making many people sick
 dilli kii jo haalat aaj he, aaj se teen dashak pehle dakshin korea kii rajdhani seol kii bhi yahi haalat thi, lekin seol ne khatarnaak str tak pahunch chuke apane kachare ke pahaad se naa keval nijaat paaya, balki kachare ke utpaadan ko hi kam kar diya
 Now the mountains of waste have ceased to exist in Seoul
 dilli kii tarah hi seol ko apane kachare kii samasya kaa hal nahin mil rahaa tha, lekin jab samasya kaabo se baahar hui, to seol ne jo sabak siikhaa, wo dilli ke liye bhi misaal ban sakati he
 The most important thing Seoul did was by converting waste into a resource
 1986 main seol kii sabase badi landphil site nanjido parkuda daalane kii jagahanheen bachi, thik vaise hi jaise dilli kii landphil site par nahin bachi he
 a new site was then discovered in the Incheon area adjacent to Seoul, but at the same time the work of reducing waste was started on a war footing as the Seoul administration had realized that if this was not done, the new landfill The site also will not take time to become a mountain of garbage
 kachare ke liye kai tarah ke bagseol risource recovery athurity ke ek afasar ke mutabik iske liye seol ne pe and thro yojana shuru kii
 Special bags were made in it, which can be purchased from the market at a nominal price
 ye bag alag- alag kachare ke liye banaae gaye, jaise geele yani biodigradable kachare ke liye alag bag, industry ke liye bag, ro material vaale kachare ke liye alag bag or baari kachar ke liye alag bag
 Also, a rule has been made that without these bags no one can throw away the garbage of their house, shop or institute
 seol sikh le dilhiciol ne jo tareeke apanaaya, usee kaa nateeja he ki aaj seol kaa naam kachare se behtareen dhang se nipatane vaale shaharon main shumaar he kyonki in tareekon se seol ne naa sirf landphil site par pahunchane vaale kachare ko assi fisadi tak kam kiya he, balki ise kaam kii cheez bana diya he
 For Delhi, the mountains of garbage have already sounded the alarm bell and hence Delhi needs to learn from cities like Seoul
 bade kaam kii cheez he kooda-kachradillikchare kaa pahaad ban chuki apni landphil cites ko khaali karaane ke liye jujh rahi he
 All experiments were done, but the success was not achieved yet
 aise main kya seol kaa formula dilli main kaam aa saktaa he kyonki seol ne kachare ko bekaar kii cheez nahin rahane diya, balki use ek ro material bana diya he
 Now the Seoul recovery facility is in search of waste as the waste processing plant in Seoul needs waste every day
 yahaan processing unit main gharon se nikle kooday ko 900 degree celsius se bhi zyada taapmaana par jalaayaa jaataa he or bijli ke saath hi construction material taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Not only that, which is dumped on roads and landfill sites in Delhi, the same waste is transported to Seoul in its plant so that it can be processed
 ghat gai kachare kii matraaiol main kachare ko process karne ke liye paanch unit banaai gayi or inhen risource recovery fecility naam diya gaya, naam se hi saaf tha ki seol kaa makasad kachare se risource yani kachare se kaam kii chizon ko ricover karnaa tha
 In Siol, 20 district garbage is processed in five resource recovery facilities
 yahaan ricikaling se hanikaarak jahrili gaisen hawa main nahin milteen, pani or jameen pradooshit nahin hote or sabase badi baat ye he ki landphil site par daale jane laayak kachare kii maatra assi fisadi tak kam ho gai he, jisase ab seol kii nai landphil site kii umr pachaas saal tak bad gai he
 Better waste management, meaner roads and intersections, glittering roads, clean streets and scenic intersections, all these things add to the beauty of a city, but this does not happen on its own
 iske liye jarurat hoti he ichha shakti kii, sarkaar ke prayaason kii or vahaan rahane vaale nivaasiyon ke sahyog kii
 If you want to see an example of the synergy of all these things, then look in Seoul
 south korea ne apane shahar ko khubasurat banane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi he, seol dilli kii tarah ghani aabaadi vaala shahar he, lekin safai ke maamle main itnaa tatpar kii sadak par kooday kaa naamo nishaan nahin dikhataa
 People are given information The role of Seoul's garbage management is the most important in keeping the city clean and this includes the fact that Seoul has told his people the importance of garbage, how garbage becomes dirt on the road and the same garbage if If it is delivered to the right place, then how much work it becomes
 ye bataane or jataane ke liye seol kaa prashasan apane nagarikon ko kachra ghar bulaata he
 Where people are told through games and interesting activities how garbage can be made a work item
 hitech suvidhaon se las kachra gharaseol main kachra ghar bhi hitech suvidhaon se las he
 There are games here that show the benefits of recycling the waste to the children, there is a facility like swimming pool and aerobics for the elders
 makasad logon ko kachra ghar bulaakar dikhaanaa he ki kachare se kya-kya banaaya ja saktaa he or agar kachare ko sahi jagah nahin phenkaa gaya, to wo kitne varshon tak shahar ke liye musiibat ban saktaa he
 This is the reason that now the people of Seol also transport the waste to the right place instead of throwing it on the road and the resource recovery facility of Seol is used as a raw material to make all the things from electricity to electricity
 dilli main kachare se nipatane ke upyaisa nahin he ki dilli main kooda prabandhan ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Many plans were made, many schemes were implemented
 kuch yojanaayen maujuuda vakt main bhi chal rahi hai, kooday se khaad bhi ban rahaa he or kooda bijli banane ke kaam bhi aa rahaa he

 On the very first day of the budget session of the Punjab Vidhan Sabha, the Akali Dal created a ruckus over the tribute of former Punjab DGP KPS gill, following which the proceedings of the assembly were briefly halted
 aapako bataa den ki punjab kii navaniyuktvidhansabha kaa bajet satrabuudhvaar ko dopaher 2 baje se shuru hua
 This budget session will run from 14 June to 23 June
 is satr main punjab kii captain sarkaar 20 june ko apana pehla aam bajet pesh karegi
 But even before the session started, the opposition parties Aam Aadmi Party and the akali-bjp alliance have decided that the Congress government of Punjab will be besieged on many issues like debt waiver of farmers, farmer suicides, attacks on Dalits
 capies gil kii shradhanjali par shuru hua hangaamaapunjab vidhansabha ke buudhvaar ko shuru hone vaale satr main jaise hikapies gilko shradhanjali dene kaa samay aayaa usee samay akali dal ne apana virodh jataane ke liye hangaamaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 After which the proceedings had to be stopped for some time
 darasal akali dal ne punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ko chitthee likhakar vidhansabha ke andar buudhvaar ko kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle di jane vaali shradhanjaliyon main capies gil ko shradhanjali naa dene kii maang kii he
 In the Akali Dal core committee meeting, it was decided not to pay tribute to the late IPS KPS Gill during the Punjab assembly session starting on Wednesday
 punjab kesiem captain amarinder sinhako bhi akali dal kii taraf se chitthee likhakar ye maang kii gai ki capies gil ko sadan ke andar shradhanjali naa dene di jaae
 The Akali Dal believes that KPS Gill falsely killed many innocent Sikhs during the period of terrorism and killed them as terrorists
 isi vajah se akali dal nahin chahta ki capies gil ko punjab vidhansabha ke andar shradhanjali di jaae
 On the other hand, the Punjab government has rejected the Akali Dal's request to not pay tribute to the late IPS KPS Gill in the Punjab Assembly
 punjab ke vitt mantri manpreet badal ne kaha ki capies gil ne punjab main aatankwaad ke khilaaf kaaphi kaam kiya he or unki vajah se aaj punjab main aman shanti kaayam he or congress sarkaar akali dal kii baat se ittefaq nahin rakhti or vidhansabha satr shuru hone se pehle di jane vaali shradhanjaliyon main capies gil ko bhi shradhanjali jarur di jaaegi
 The Punjab assembly was expected to be in a ruckus before the session and now another dispute arose over the matter of paying tribute to KPS Gill, which makes it impossible to successfully conduct the proceedings of the assembly
 kisaan mudde par bhi ghir sakati he captain sarkaaravidhansabha satr main sabase bada mudda rahegaa kisaanon ke karj maafee kaa
 The Punjab farmers' delegation met Punjab Governor VP Badnaur on Tuesday and gave a memorandum telling them how the Congress had promised loan waiver to the farmers before coming to power but now after coming to power, Congress She is forgetting the promises
 punjab ke kisaanon ne saaf kar diya ki agar aane vaale dinon main or 20 june ko hone vaale bajet satr ke dauraan kisaanon ke karj maafee ko lekar punjab sarkaar ne koi bada elaan nahin kiya to phir puure punjab main andolan khadaa kar diya jayega
 Also, farmers of Punjab will also participate in the Satyagraha of farmers to be held on 15 June at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 haalanki punjab sarkaar ne kisaanon ko ye bharosa dene kii koshish kii he ki aane vaale bajet main kisaanon ke liye har sambhav madad kii koshish kii jaaegi lekin kisaanon ko dikkat is baat se he ki ek or to sarkaar kisaanon ko raahat dene or karj maafee kaa vaada kar rahi he or duusari or apni aarthik sthiti kaa hawala bhi sarkaar kii or se diya ja rahaa he aise main kisaanon ko ab ummid kam he ki punjab sarkaar kii ore se unhen koi badi raahat milane vaali he
 Overall, the difficulties of the Punjab government in Punjab are going to increase immensely in the session of the Punjab Assembly starting on Wednesday
 jahaan ek ore sadan ke andar unhen vipakshi partiyon aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi gathbandhan ke hamalon ko jhelana hoga to vahiin sadak par kisaanon ke gusse kaa saamana bhi unhen karnaa hoga

 i am fond of him & proud of him like many of you
 Hope, wish & pray that the society would be able to distinguish all these sponsored issues & stand by Mr Anand Kumar at this stage, so that he is able to continue his mission of taking our nation to the top
 
 
 Jai Bihar Jai hind!the lynching continues in one form or another – from physical to verbal to "rumoral"
 
 
 This time the victim seems to be our own hero of "super30-anand Kumar" - the genius, mathematician, guru, role model, pride of Bihar, pride of the Nation with years of successful teaching
 
 
 1>2
 
 
 
 
 providing quality education selflessly & shaping his students in making it to the top academic echelons
 It seems he has been put under hindrance by some unrecognized people who've named his brand in a fake, fabricated issue with some unsubstantiated charges
 
 
 
 
 
 2>3
 
 
 for their own vested interest, which has no connection with him or his vision
 Really wonder – aren’t we damaging our own kids future (& in turn Bihar’s future) by critising or maligning him
 i personally know him - am his supporter, well-wisher & admirer
 
 
 
 3> 4 It is sad that by launching a campaign against # anand_kumar, the operator of # Super30, certain groups are indulging in characterization by tarnishing his image
 samaaj ke mehanatakash vanchit- shoshit va pichde tabake vaali prishthbhumi se nikalakar @anand_super_30 ne # bihar or # bharat kaa naam raushan kiya he jisaki prashansa kii jaani chahie

 Despite the continuous increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, the central government is refusing to cut tax
 kendra sarkaar kii daleel he ki is faisle se use rajasav kaa bada nuksaan hoga
 In such a situation, what option does the central government have to provide relief to the common man? India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari said that the Indian government has been dependent on the energy sector for its expenditure for decades
 yah kshetra sarkaar kii kamai main sabase bada yogadan karata he or isi yogadan ke sahare beete dashakon main kendra or rajya sarkaron ne apane kharch main bada ijapha kar liya he
 Accordingly, according to Anshuman Tiwari, if the central and state governments want to give relief to the common man, then they need to cut their expenditure by a big cut

 Which have been squeezing a stifling tax policy for the entire energy sector including electricity, petrol-diesel and gas for decades

 If GST is implemented, petrol will be 89 to 60 liters, diesel will be 50 Anshuman Tiwari said that on one hand, while the governments are seeing the increase in petrol and diesel, in view of assembly elections, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will burden the state exchequer
 The work of distributing mobile phones is being done

 They have the opportunity to squeeze the most consumed product in the country

 avangers- infinity war movie se zyada yah logon ke liye ek yaadgaar cinemai event he, jahaan ek hi movie main alag alag sheershakon ke saath puri siries main ab tak rahe lagbhag saare superhiroj ko ek saath dekha ja saktaa he
 Till date we have always heard that good always triumphs over evil, you can see this lesson completely reversed in this movie
 ek hi jagah par thor, aayran main, star-lard, captain america, blike vido, skarlet wich , vijan, loki, thanos, gamora, grout, spidar main, blike panther, doctor strange, raaket rekun, nebula or bhi kai superhiroj is film ko khaas banaate hai
 If so many superheroes fail to stop a villain and some even lose their lives, then the strength of the villain will create fear
 yah film comic book se inspired he
 Comic book artists are not bound by visual effects, budgets, so they are allowed to give us precious fantasies on paper: new worlds, mysterious creatures, dazzling spaceships, spelling powers, and fights on every page
 infinity war in sab simaaon ko laangh kar aapako alag hi duniya kii saiyr kara degi
 Marvel films attracting people through unique story, action, adventure, humor are among the most popular films in India
 alag alag sheershak or naamon ke maarval superhiroj ke prashansak or lokapriyata desh main teji se badhati ja rahi he
 The recently released Avengers - Infinity War, is the most heart-wrenching ending of all Marvel movies to date
 kahani ke ant main suparvillen apane makasad main kaamyaab ho jaataa he or logon ke dilon main ek sawaal chhod jaataa he ki aakhir thanos ne kiya kya? saare superhiroj kahaan chale gaye?bilkul bahubali ke ant main uthe sawaal kii tarah - aakhir katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa? isi ant ke kaaran logon ko besabri se iske agle bhaag kaa intjaar he
 People are also eager to know that their favorite superhero will be alive in the next movie or not? Audiences are making their own speculations about the disappearance of superheroes

 The superwoman Thanos of this film does not have a hunger for strength, but his aim is to correct imbalances in the universe
 yani vah sansadhano or aabaadi ke bich santulan chahta he
 Even if this thought of Thanos sounds good, but the way he adopts it for balance is what makes him a super villain
 kaise, ise jaanane ke liye movie dekhnaa jaruri he
 
 
 Because the story of this super villain, which has dominated more than a dozen superheroes, will never be read or heard before! Harsha Sharma is a student of India Today Media Institute and is an intern in India Today *** ham gandhi ko kis rup main dekhte hai? mahaan adarsh ke rup main, swatantraaa ke sabase bade nayak ke rup main, maanavtaa ke mahanayake ke rup main yaa dharti par chalate-phirte ishwar ke rup main? yaa phir gandhi ko us rup main dekhte hai jis rup main wo maansikta dekhati he jisane unki hatya kar di thi? ek paakhandee, ek deshadrohi, ek muslimparast, ek bharat virdohi, angrejon kaa pitthu, puunjipatiyon kaa dalal or hinduon kaa janmajaat dushman? aaj jab desh mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti manaa rahaa he to in sawaalon kaa jawaab jaananaa jaruri he
 And to answer all these questions, you can read the book 'gandhi and Samaj' by Gandhian thinker, writer, novelist Giriraj Kishore, which is a collection of his news articles written in the last 20-22 years
 ‘pehla girmitiyaa’ likhakar gandhi-chintak ke rup main pratishthit hue, varisht hindi kathakaar giriraaj kishor ne is pustak main sankalit apane aalekhon, vaktavyon or vyakhyanon se gandhi ko alag-alag konon se samajhane or samajhane kii koshish kii he
 All these articles have been written on different occasions over the years; Hence their references are extremely contemporary; And let's look at Gandhi from today
 in aalekhon main ‘vyakti gandhi’ or ‘vichaar gandhi’ ke viruddh idhar jor pakad rahe sangathit dushprachaar ko bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya he; or unke hatyare ko poojanevaali maansikta kii hinsr sanrachana ko bhi chintaa va chintan kaa vishay banaaya gaya he
 When a person's personal ambitions reach zero, that person stands on the highest peak, Gandhi is his biggest example
 unhone har ghadi khud ko nae badlaav ke liye prastut kiya
 Gandhi stood in the market but stayed away from the market
 gandhi ne duniya ke saamne aazaadee kaa nayaa najariya pesh kiya or aazaadee paane ke liye ladaai kaa bilkul anoothaa hathiyaar
 Taking Satya and non-violence out of the rotten pages of old books, Gandhi stood before the British cannon, sword, sticks and guns
 bahuton ko yah chamatkaar lagata tha to bahuton ko morrkhtaa
 But it is said that if the human is determined to do something from the deep depths of the conscience, then the world succumbs in his footsteps
 gandhi ne yahi kiya
 India's independence became a frontier of the world
 dakshin africa ke purv raashtrapati nelson mandela ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa he ki ve kai baton par gandhi se sahamat nahin hote hai lekin unke paas gandhi ke bataae raste par chalane ke alaava or koi rasta bhi nahin he
 If we look at Gandhi's life and contradictions, it can be said that his personality and philosophy was a continuous entity
 ek nirmaanadhin imaarat jisamen har kshan kaam chalata tha
 His life was a laboratory, a mind as well
 ek avadharana ke rup main gandhi usee tarah ek sutara ke rup main hamen milte hai jis tarah marks; yah hamaare upar he ki ham apane vartmaan or bhavishya ko us sutara se kaise samajhen
 This is the reason why they persist despite being shot, intermittently proving them irrelevant, and how many historical mistakes are attributed; And will live
 unki hatya karanevaali takaton ke varchasv ke baad bhi ve honge
 They are not a fully written scripture, they are a way of living that always demands to be continued
 giriraaj kishor ne beesvin sadi ke guzarate andhkaar or 21veen sadi main uski aapattijanak chaaya ke bich mahatma gandhi par uthte sawaalon kaa apni tarah se jawaab diya he
 He has not defended Gandhi anywhere
 vaise bhi gandhi naa kisi ke bachaae batch sakate hai naa kisi ke dubaae dub sakate hai
 Gandhi is the name of a continuous journey
 jis raahi ko gandhi main bharosa ho, vah saath chal de
 The one who is not, was also forced to come on Gandhi's path late
 aakhir aresas or bijepi main gandhi ke liye aadarneey aaj ban gaye hai to iske peeche gandhi kaa vah marm he jisko samajhane main kaiyon ko bahut lanbaa vakt lag jaataa he
 Mahatma Gandhi wrote Hind Swaraj at the age of 40
 vah kitaab sasteneble dawalpment yani tikaoo vikaas kaa mul mantra he
 If Giriraj Kishore has tried to test the relevance of Hind Swaraj to the test of modern civilization, then he has also introduced the use of untruth in the name of Gandhi

 According to me, former Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Quan Yu was perhaps the last democratic dictator leader of this world, who was chosen by the people for six decades as the leader of the People's Action Party and gave a chance to do democratic dictatorship
 badale main unhone logon ko kam bolne, simit dharmik aazaadee or baat-baat main loktantr ke chauthe khambhe ko pakadaney kii aazaadee lagbhag na ke baraabar di
 People got into the habit of working silently and in return people got a taste of the splendor of the West and the delicious cuisine of the East in a peaceful way

 Those who want to rigorously implement their model of neo-liberalism while citing democratic values
 lee kwan you bharat ko ek desh nahin, balki britain kii rail line ke kareeb basane vaale 35 deshon kaa samooh kaha karte the
 There is no doubt that Lee Quan, like Singapore, was a strange mixture of socialism and neoliberalism
 wo shaayad isliye bhi, kyonki wo janm se chini the or vyavhaarik poonjivadi ke kattar samarthak britain kii chhatrachhaaya main paley the
 He kept stunning the public with socialist disciplinary methods and developing Singapore in a capitalist manner
 wo aise pehle netaa the, jinhone janata ko anushaasit rakhane ke lihaaj se indira gandhi ke immergency lagane kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He used to insist that India is a great country, but it is fast losing the opportunity to make itself great
 lee kwan you bharat ko pasand karte the, lekin naukarshahi ke vyavasthaagat dhaanche ko nafrat kii had tak naapsand bhi karte the
 He said that the bureaucrats of India do not consider themselves to be facilitators, but to enforce the rules
 yaheen se sansthagat dhaanche main buniyadi galati shuru hoti he
 He used to say that instead of thinking well about industrialists, the idea of raising money somehow remains in most bureaucrats, which is a big hurdle in the development of any country
 haalanki bahut saare bhartiya ye jarur aapako kehete mil jaaenge ki wo singapore ke damaghontu anushaasanamak jivan kii bajaay dilli ke pradooshit maahaul main acha pradarshan karnaa zyada pasand karte hai
 But we must admit that he was entitled to say all these things because after the independence from Britain in 1965, he removed his country from the mess and transformed it into a shining finance market
 jisaki suraksha karne ke liye uske paas koi baari-bharkam sena yaa suraksha kavach nahin he, ye apane aap main hairaan karne vaala he
 We need to learn from them the discipline of political behaviorism to some extent, only then can democratic values be protected from the dangers of mobilization

 The member whose name the test tube will be emptied out of the race to become captain
 isliye test tub khaali karne se pehle gharavaalon ko uchit kaaran bataanaa hoga
 Priyanka told Manu that she emptied the test tube named Nitibha and she got into an argument with Nitibha

 During this time Monalisa asked Lopamudra to empty the test tube named after him as he is not ready to be the captain yet

 pehla gong bajane ke baad manavir ne sahil ke naam kaa test tub khaali kar diya or kaha ki vah ghar main nae hai or unhen lagata he ki vah abhi captency ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Nitibha tried to do Manu in his favor, but he did not believe and he emptied the test tube named Nitibha as soon as the next gong was played
 raat main manu ne priyanka ke haath kaa bana khaanaa khaane se inkaar kar diya, unhone kaha ki jab tak vah ghar main hai priyanka kaa banaaya khaanaa nahin khaaenge
 Manu said that he is tired of Priyanka's antics
 der raat chalanjaron ne ek baar phir cycling shuru kii taaki gharavaale so saken
 But after getting too tired, Bani gets angry that the family members do not mind that they are crushing for them
 bani ne kaha ki task kii sanchalika hi so rahi hai, unhone yah bhi kaha ki unka janmdin tha iske baavjood gharavaalon ne unke saath acha bartaav nahin kiya
 Rahul Dev tried to convince her but she did not listen
 swami om ne jab priyanka ko bataaya ki chalangers thak gaye hai to priyanka ne kaha ki unhen rukne bol diya jaae
 After this, all the challengers stopped work and Big Boss started playing sirens to wake up the family

 agast kii 24 taarikh ko niztaa ke adhikaar ke bare main aitihaasik faisla die supreme court ko ek saal ho gaya
 This was a momentous moment in India's constitutional jurisprudence, when the judgment made privacy a clear and blunt manner an essential part of the basic human values of dignity, freedom and autonomy
 yah bhi pehali baar hua jab nyaaypalika ne maujuuda vakt ke technology se jude khataron par dhyaan diya or is baat ko ahmiyat di ki logon ko yah chunane or tay karne kaa adhikaar he ki unki nijee jaankaree kis tarah ekatra or istemaal kii jaae
 Although six different judges wrote the verdict, the court strongly insisted that the person at the center of the right to privacy was the person
 isliye yah na keval hairaan balki maayoos karne vaali baat bhi thi ki pichley maheene apni report or nijee data suraksha vidheyak kaa masauda sarkaar ko saunpane vaali nyaayamurti shrikrishna samiti ne data suraksha ko navachaar or 'swatantra tathaa mukt digital arthvyavastha' ke chashme se hi dekhne kaa rasta chunaa
 The important thing to note is that the committee was formed only because of the privacy rights issue
 samiti kaa gathan karte hue sarkaar ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki vah nijee jaankariyon ke andhadhundh istemaal par kanoon ke jariye niyam-kaayade lagu karne ko lekar sanjeeda he or isliye niztaa ko alag buniyadi adhikaar banane kii jarurat nahin he
 Whatever the government's point of view, it was imperative for the committee to take care of the fact that the court insisted on making the person strong and would give importance to the constitutional guarantees given to him
 magar bajaay iske ki samiti vyakti ko uske data kaa niyantaa or maalik banane ko apana lakshya banaati, vah digital arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene main sarkaar ko madadgaar banataa dekhne par amada he
 The committee's understanding of the recommendations is evident from the first chapter of its report, titled 'A Free and Fair Digital Economy'
 yah adhyay data suraksha ke liye aise 'hindustani nazariye' kii maang karata he jo desh kii vikaas kii jaruraton par aadhaarit ho
 It states that restrictions on privacy may be necessary for innovation and delivery of services
 yah adaalat main sarkaar kii us daleel kii yaad dilaataa he, jisamen usne kaha tha ki vyakti ke adhikaron ko janakalyaan kii khatir peeche hat janaa chahie
 The important point was that the court rejected the argument that personal liberties are an essential precondition for achieving social benefits for the people
 report data suraksha ke (buniyadi) adhikaar aadhaarit nazariye se apane alag hatane kii vajah bataane kii bhi koi asal koshish nahin karti
 She does not reliably explain why (additional) restrictions on privacy may be necessary
 galati se vah maanakar chalati he ki navachaar yaa nae-nae kaam keval niztaa kii keemat par hi mumkin hai
 The result is that its draft bill has its fate in weakening personal rights and throwing security guards out
 masalan, report saajha bhalaai ke liye big data or artificial intelligence (eani) ke istemaal par bahut jor detii he
 Indiscriminate profiles of individuals can be created by processing large amounts of private data
 jahaan eani kaa makasad mashiinon ko tark or faisle lene main samarth bananaa he, vahiin adhyetaon main aam raay yah he ki un nateezon main galtiyaan hone kii bahut zyada ashanka he, jisase bhedbhaav or duusare kism ke nuksaan ho sakate hai
 Another thing that hurts privacy in the bill is the need to keep a copy of all personal data in India
 iske peeche jahiraa taur par desh main digital buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan kii ichha dikhaai detii he, par is praavdhaan se nijee data or bhi zyada suraksha khataron se ghir jaataa he or sarkaar kii jasusi ke liye khul jaataa he
 Given the laws of India allowing spying and surveillance, this provision can be misused against citizens — such as opponents who question the government's actions
 dilachasp baat yah he ki samiti bharat kii nigaraanee vyavastha main asardaar niyantranon (jaise baatcheet yaa likhit samvaad ko bich main rokkar sunne-padhgaye se pehle nyaayik manjuuri) kii kami kii baat ko sweekaar karti he, par to bhi vah data ko desh main hi rakhane kii vakaalat karte hue in chintaaon ko khaarij kar detii he
 At the moment we have no choice but to leave personal information about our interactions and functioning with the government and companies
 acha hota ki samiti navachaar kii aspasht dharanaon par nijee swatantraaa ko ahmiyat detii
 Hope that the government will consider these flaws and pass a bill that can really strengthen basic rights
 —kritika bharadwaj vakil hai jinhone niztaa ke adhikaar maamle ke yachikakartaon kii sahaayta kii thi

 tejasvine mukhyamantri par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki nitish kumaar ne khud ko faaydaa pahunchane vaale afasar aisi jagah baitha rakhe hai jinhone lakhon chaatro ke jivan ko barbaad kar diya he
 Why are there no errors in the marksheets of the children of those officers? They asked why Nitish Kumar is silent
 What mental happiness are you getting by ruining the lives of millions of students? Every year, the Bihar board is feeding under your nose
 tejasvi ne nitish kumaar se jawaab maangate hue kaha, 'nitish kumaar jawaab aapako dena hoga
 Do not mike in front of the officers
 jo kaam nahin karata use hatie
 Now, who will fix the marksheets of the students who have to enroll further? Why is his important year being wasted? a helpline and camp should be set up quickly
 tejasvi ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki chaatro kaa bhavishya karaab ho rahaa he or swayan ghoshit gyani- dhyani susheel modi chup hai
 Tejaswi said, 'where has your knowledge of the past year, Mr
 Rumor Mian ji? If not on the results of the students and the black exploits of the Bihar board, at least we would have chewed us up

 Please tell that when Sachin started playing, he was 16 years old
 pehali pari ke baad kyon rone lage the sachin?sachin tendulkar ne pehali pari main 15 ran banaae the
 Reminiscent of 28 years ago, Huischin Tendulkar said in Facebook Live - When i reached the dressing room after playing my first innings, i felt that i had arrived at Rong Place
 bahut mushkil main tha
 Went to the bathroom, started crying
 phir vahaan jo senior players the unhone mujhe samajhaayaa
 Encouraged me

 After this, the team was selected in India

 At that time there were strong bowlers like Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis
 unki ball ko phase karnaa kathin kaam tha
 What was the turning point of life Tendulkar further said - Hardly scored 15 runs in the first innings
 iske baad maine apane kariyar kii duusari pari main fifty lagaai
 During that time i came to know that i can do this
 jab main duusari pari khilne gaya to maine tay rakhaa tha ki mujhe score board nahin dekhnaa he, main sirf ghadi dekh rahaa tha
 i just wanted to spend time on the field there
 kisi bhi keemat par mujhe vahaan khadaa rahanaa tha

 214 tigers of Corbett Tiger Reserve Park are knocking in the eyes of wildlife smugglers
 ek ore jahaan puri duniya main baaghon kii sankhya teji se ghat rahi he vahiin corbett main pichhali gananaa ke dauraan baaghon kii sankhya main ek-chauthai kii badhotaree darj hui
 While Corbett had 164 tigers in 2008, the number rose to 214 in 2010
 corbett park duniya main baaghon kii sabase ghani aabaadi vaala kshetra he
 This increased population of tigers has now become a problem for those who are targeted by the wildlife traffickers of Haryana and Maharashtra besides the Bavaria gang
 corbett main beete ek maheene ke dauraan paanch shavakon sahit nau baaghon kii maut hui he, jisamen se teen baaghon ko vanyajeev taskaron ne maar daalaa
 On May 24, forest staff recovered several traps and tiger meat at Savalde Beat in the park's Dhela range
 lekin is dauraan do taskar nikal bhaage, phir 28 may ko vanakarmiyon ne corbett ke surakshit samajhe jane vaale bijrani jone main bhi baagh kaa maance or aanten baraamad kin
 From here, forest workers also got tents, water bottles and food items
 chaar din ke bheetar do van renjon main baagh kii aanten baraamad hone se saaf ho gaya ki corbett ke bheetar taskar sakriy hai
 It is also evident from the manufactured goods in Maharashtra lying near the recovered organs of tigers in the Vizrani range that the gangs of Maharashtra are active in Corbett
 dedh hafte ke dauraan taskaron ne maharashtra, uttar pradesh or uttarakhand main milakar aath baaghon ko maar daalaa
 Of these, three tigers were killed in Corbett Park in Uttarakhand, two tigers in Tadoba Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra and three in Dudhwa and Pilibhit forests of Uttar Pradesh

 Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) of Uttarakhand
 es
 Sharma confirmed this
 ve kehete hai, ''vibhaag ko esemes se baaghon ke shikaar kii supaari dene kii soochna mili he, jisaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 "so far, the Corbett administration has not been able to trace the gang of Maharashtra, but this time according to the revelations by the smuggler gang of Haryana arrested in the Vizrani range by Corbett's SOG team on June 6, their plan this time to Corbett Had to disarm the tiger
 giraftaar kiye gaye pinjore, haryana ke ramesh bagdi , tarachand bagdi tathaa panchakula ke ginia bagdi ne bataaya ki ve 20 may se park main sakriy hai

 The park administration is also keen to suppress the news related to their smuggling after failing to protect the tigers
 park ne na sirf maare gaye teen baaghon ke prakaran ko chhipaane kii koshish kii, balki is sambandh main adhikariyon ko galat soochna bhi di
 When the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) Secretary Rajesh Gopal and Member Vijendra Singh arrived on June 5 to investigate the illegal road to Jamur in the restricted area of corbett, the park administration also hid incidents related to tigers in front of them
 yahaan tak ki is dauraan donon ghatnasthalon se baaghon ke ang va avshesh hataane ke saath shikariyon ke juuton ke nishaan bhi mitaane kaa kaam hua
 Despite this, Vijendra Singh, an NTCA member who reached Savde Beat said, "looks like tigers have been hunted
" pradesh sarkaar ko is maamle kii jaanch kisi bade adhikari se karaani chahie taaki tasviir saaf ho sake
 Corbett Park director Ranjan Mishra denies the death of three tigers that took place there
 ve kehete hai, ''park ke bheetar baaghon kaa koi shikaar nahin hua he
 a gang was reported to be active in the park, which has been arrested
 '' lekin mishra yah bhi kehete hai ki 1,300 varg kimi kshetra kii suraksha karnaa aasaan nahin he
 That too when the eyes of smugglers from all over the world are focused on tigers
 antarrashtriya str ke corbett park main ghuspaith badhane kaa ek kaaran vanarakshakon kii baari kami bhi he
 Of the 139 sanctioned posts of forest guards for the park, 72 posts are vacant, while 35 others are deployed by departmental officers in their offices
 520 varg kimi ke kshetra kii suraksha kaa kaam sirf 32 vanarakshakon ke jimme he
 Not only this, these forest guards who manage the security of the park have only one stick in the name of safety equipment
 tiger protection force ke ek jawan anand pant kii 2 june ko bijrani range main gasht ke dauraan maut ho gai or corbett prashasan dilasa hi de rahaa he
 "the process of formation of the Tiger Protection Force is in the final stages," says Ranjan Mishra

 The echo of tiger hunting was also heard in the assembly session that lasted till June 4
 netaa pratipaksh ajay bhatta ne kaha ki kuch hi maheene ke bheetar pradesh main 22 baaghon kii maut chintajanak he
 Crores allocated for the protection of tigers Rs
 kaa bajet bhi kargar nahin he

 gauri kahati hai, ''ghayal baagh 20 may se hi corbett main gum rahaa tha, lekin use 25 may ko nainital chidyaghar le jaaya gaya, jahaan ilaaj ke abhaav main uski maut ho gai
 Rajendra Agarwal of the Wildlife Protection Society of India says, "35 tigers have died in Corbett in a year and a half, but the administration and the forest department are not tired of making claims
