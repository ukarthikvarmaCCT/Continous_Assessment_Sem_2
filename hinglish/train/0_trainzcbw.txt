 mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh ke alaava samaajawaadee party ke kisi or netaa kii tasviir bhi nahin lagi hui he
 Three more people whose black and white picture appears on the chariot are Ram Manohar Lohia Janeshwar Mishra and Jayaprakash Narayan

 It used to say that even in poor countries like Ethiopia, such old assumptions are no longer applicable that service sector employment is low, but on the contrary, the productivity of labor is increasing faster in service sector than other sectors- Especially when far more modern services like mobile phone networks are gaining momentum
 is prakriya kii agali kadi hamen vaishvikaran ke ulatney (diglobaligeshan) main dikhaai degi

 ''smart" mobile phone rakhane vaale logon kii hissedari pichley paanch saal ke dauraan 75 fisadi tak pahunch chuki he jo 20 fisadi se bhi kam hua karti thi

 This fact in itself gives an indication of the disturbances during the tenure of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 singh 2004 main satta main aae the or agle das saal main bharat kii nivesh dar jidipi ke 25 fisadi se badhkar 35 fisadi ke paar chali gai
 It was a good sign, but it created a confusing confidence among the economically affluent sections of the country

 In such a situation, many leading Indians felt that they, like China, are building an economy with high growth and low inflation in the country
 singh ke pehle kaarykaal main adhikansh vakt mudrasphiti kii chaal thik rahi

 This decline meant a loss of more than $ 72 billion every year

 This led Indians to stay in villages instead of coming to urban factories to earn wages, which reduced the productivity of the economy and increased the risk of inflation
 bharat iklauta desh he jahaan mudrasphiti kaa lakshya kendriya bank tay karata he or byaaj daren kam rakhane ke liye rajnatik dabaav hota he
 Fortunately, in 2013, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan made it clear that it is the bank's priority to fight inflation

 Apart from Shatabdi Roy, the ED has sent notices to former TMC mps Kunal Ghosh, Neetu Sarkar, Sajjan Agrawar, Sandhir Aggarwal and Bamba

 Earlier on 9 July, Bangla actor Prosenjit Chatterjee was summoned by the ED to appear on 19 July in connection with the Rose Valley Chit Fund scam
 idi ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki chatarji se mani londring adhinium ke tahat poochtacha kii jaaegi

 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon kii ghoshnaa ho chuki he
 Mayawati is from BSP in the name of claiming the Chief Minister's post, Akhilesh from SP but the face of BJP which has become the biggest party in the survey so far has not been finalized yet
 congress ne bhi savarna or khaskar brahman vot bank ke maddenjar dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko maidan main utaara tha lekin gathbandhan kii baton ke bich shila khud ko sarender karti najar ain
 Sheila herself had said in a TV interview that if there is a congress-sp alliance, i will retreat for the good of UP
 bachakar chal rahi he bijepiloksabhaa chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan ke baad lagaataar do rajyon (dilli or bihar) ke vidhansabha chunaavon main shikast khaane ke baad bijepi ab upi main sanbhalkar aage bad rahi he
 It is believed that the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections will also affect the 2019 general elections, which is why the BJP has not decided any face so far
 janata main koi galat sandesh na jaae isliye bijepi ke netaa yah kehete najar aa rahe hai ki hamaara kaaryakarta or vikaas hi hamaara mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa he
 According to party sources, the BJP once again wants to play a bet on Rajnath Singh, a leader with a strong support base and a clear image, but the name is not being announced due to some reasons
 sthaneey netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki bhaajapa kaa mukhyamantri chunaav baad hi tay kiya jayega
 If the preparations are going on, according to the sources, the BJP wants to play bet on Rajnath only to compete with the image of Akhilesh and Mayawati
 iske alaava badi vajah yah he ki rajnath singh ne apane mukhyamantrical main kisaan credit card chalaaya tha notebandi ke baad pareshaan gramin varg ko apni ore laane kii koshish main bhaajapa rajnath kaa cheharaa bhunaanaa chaah rahi he
 There is a plan to bring this to the fore in the campaign, but an attempt will be made to avoid a formal announcement
 pradesh main bhaajapa jo ab jo bhi poster-binar banaaegi usamen modi or amit shah ke saath-saath rajnath singh kii bhi tasviir rakhi jaaegi
 It is being told that all the photos will be kept of the same size
 faisla lene main yah he dikkataraajya main vikaas, bhrashtachar, bigadati kanoon evam vyavastha ke muddon par chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi bijepi kaa maananaa he ki rajnath kaa cheharaa party ko rajya main phayda dilaa saktaa he
 However, a section of the party also believes that Brahmin voters may get angry if Rajnath is exposed
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bijepi unhen mukhyamantri ke rup main pesh nahin karnaa chaahati balki party ke prachaar kaa pramukh cheharaa banaakar saamne laayaa ja rahaa he
 Rajnath was also the most popular BJP leader in Aaj Tak's survey
 Let me tell you that India Today and Axis together did the biggest poll survey in UP
 survey main upi kaa siyaasi mood jaanane kii koshish kii gai thi
 In the survey, Akhilesh Yadav emerged as the first choice of the people as the Chief Minister
 party kii andruni kalah se jujh rahe akhilesh ke liye ye bada chunaav he
 BJP has not fielded any CM candidate
 aise main akhilesh ke paas iskaa phayda uthaane kaa puraa mauka he
 In cm's choice, Mayawati was at number two, while Rajnath Singh took third place
 ye tha haikhilesh yadav- 33%mayawati- 25%rajnath singh- 20%yogi adityanath- 18%priyanka gandhi-1%mulaayam singh- 1%varun gandhi- 1% Reliance Communications (rcom) has paid Rs 550 crore to Sweden's telecom equipment maker Ericsson
 lekin ye paise unhone apane bade bhai mukesh ambani se lekar chukaaye hai
 If the company fails to do so, rcom chairman Anil Ambani could have been sentenced to 3 months in jail
 aise main madad ke liye bade bhai mukesh ambani saamne aae
 Anil Ambani thanked his elder brother Mukesh Ambani for helping in the trouble
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ke aadesh ke baad karj chukaane ke liye sahi samay par madad ke liye bhai mukesh ambani or bhabhi nita ko shukriya
 Actually, Reliance Communications was to make this payment within the deadline set by the Supreme Court till Tuesday
 pichley maheene is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ucchtam nyaayalay ne ise jaanboojh kar bhugtan nahin karne kaa maamla bataaya tha or anil ambani ko adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa doshi paaya tha
 After which the court ordered the company to either pay Erickson's dues within four weeks or Ambani would face imprisonment for three months
 is ghatnakram se jude ek sutara ne bataaya ki arcom ne ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdeshon ke anusaar arikson ko 550 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kar diya he
 However, its official statement has not yet been given by Reliance Communications (rcom)
 vahiin arikson se bhi is sambandh main koi pratikriya hasil nahin kii ja saki he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court gave time till March 19 to make the payment to rcom

 "sources said that Chandaria is also being investigated for his involvement in the Nigerian drug racket

 You must have heard this film song many times
 aksar filmon main kabutaron dwaara premi jodon kaa sandesh le jate bhi dekha hoga
 Pigeons used to be an important medium for carrying messages in the olden days
 lekin digital yug main kabutar kii praasangikta thodaa hairaan karne vaali he
 Yes, we are talking about the pigeons of Odisha Police, which are still used for sending messages
 yahaan police ke paas 50 kabutaron kaa ek samooh he, jo khaas taur par ek jagah se duusari jagah sandesh le jane ke liye prashikshit he
 Recently trials were conducted for these 50 pigeons
 is dauraan police ne kabutaron ke jariye bhubaneshwar ke ouati ground se katak tak sandesh bheja
 The main objective of this exercise is disaster management
 yadi kisi karanvash modern communication system kharaab ho jaae, to police is paaramparik madhyam ke jariye apane sandeshon kaa aadan-pradaan kar sakati he
 Flying pigeons flying at a speed of 75 kmph are trained with the help of the Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage
 kabutar 75 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se ud sakate hai
 This method is effective in areas cut off from the road network
 ek kabutar kii umr kareeb 20 saal tak hoti he
 Once trained, the pigeon can work long hours
 prakritik aapadaa ke vakt aae kambataya ja rahaa he ki jab bhi prakritik aapadaa ai he
 Whenever communication systems collapsed, messages were exchanged through pigeons
 saal 1982 main odisha ke banki jile main bheeshan baadh ai thi
 At that time all the systems were destroyed
 tab police ne kabutaron ke jariye hi alag-alag jagahon par sandesh bhejne kaa kaam kiya tha

 maidan main team india ke captain viraat kohli kii aakraamakata ko lekar is samay charchaaon kaa daur jari he
 i ask, what is the problem with Virat Kohli's aggression! Why did he remain the gentleman? Hindustan has taken up the responsibility of keeping cricket a 'gentleman's Game'
 sabase badi baat jamaane ko ‘sajjanta' ke sammaan kii fikr he kya? duniya ‘soft' logon ko ‘teken for granted' lene lagati he
 Starts pressing
 saurav ganguli ne aankh main aankh daalkar baat karnaa sikhaaya to team india ne jeetna bhi siikhaa
 There was also aggression in Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 'coolness'
 ab viraat kohli seene takaraa rahe hai
 Kohli's chest is not hollow like that 56 inches from which only talk and promises come out
 is seene ke andar aag he jo sirf jeet se bujhna chaahati he
 This confidence is also necessary for success - 'you are a standing captain and i am the best batsman in the world!' Whether or not Kohli has said it, there is poetry in the band only when the arrogance is showing
 wo kehete hai na
 
 
 There are many 'armchair' critics who spend more time in the commentary box than on the cricket field
 unamem se ek naam he-sanjay manjrekar
 Janab has objected to Virat Kohli's aggression
 unka kahana he ki kohli ke achche pradarshan ke kaaran unki kai asweekaarya harkaton ko nazarandaaz kar diya jaataa he jabaki aankade is baat kii tasadeeq karte hai ki aakraamakata se kohli kaa pradarshan nikharata he
 Interestingly, Kohli's treatment of Australian captain Tim Paine has not gone downhill
 ve iskaa lutf uthaane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Former Australians including Alan Border and Shane Warne are building bridges to praise Kohli's victory
 sar viv richards ke liye ve sabase achche captain hai (haalanki plaing ilevan se lekar captain ke taur par unke faisalon par sawaal uthte rahe hai)
 Bro Kohli, your 'boys' will need this 'man' in the World Cup! Discussions are going on in Australia that 'friendly banters' are necessary on the field for the thrill of Test cricket
 garmagarmee sahi he lekin ise budtameezi kii had paar nahin kerani chahie
 At one time, Manjrekar had commented on the footwork of master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, commenting that age has come to dominate him
 tab ‘futwork' par sawaal uthaane vaale manjrekar ko ‘bacfoot' par aana padaa tha
 The enlightenment of the cinematic world has always been a matter of debate
 nasiruddin shah jaisi shakhsiyat jab kohli ko sabase bura qaraar dete hai to thodi hairaani hoti he
 It is free
 unki raay apni jagah durust ho sakati he
 People like Naseer are probably victims of 'frozen in time'

 Today's youth is not a petitioner, he knows how to take away his rights and assert his rights
 soochna or praudyogiki ke zarie bharat kii badhati taaqat kaa duniya dekh rahi he
 The bottom line is that India likes aggression
 phir chaahe ‘sargical strike' kii modi brand akramakata ho, yaa phir rahul gandhi kii ‘chaukeedaar chor he' yaa phir arvind kejariwal kii ‘dilli ke maalik ham hai' vaala engri yang main vaala andaaj
 People like it

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team Sourav Ganguly will retire from international cricket after a four-test series against Australia
 unke sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi ab tamaam atakalon par viraam lag gaya he

 Did the SP-BSP once speak on terrorism? Abused Modi so much, but did he even abused terrorism? Are the SP-BSP people afraid of terrorists or are they keeping quiet to save them? ”PM Modi asked,“ Today, as many people are telling themselves as the future Prime Minister, they have made a plan to strengthen the country, protect the soldiers
 Have you kept it? ' He alleged that what can be expected from those who believe the lies of Pakistan to defeat Modi, want to become the hero of Pakistan

 What Ashok Kumar Dhyanchand might be thinking of today in his home in Bhopal can be gauged from his statement in February 2014
 haaki khilaadi or dhyanchand singh ke bete ashok kumaar sachin tendulkar ko bharat ratna die jane ke baad pratikriya de rahe the
 Ashok Dhyanchand then said that i have given up hope that Major Dhyanchand will get Bharat Ratna sometime
 google hamaari aadhunik smriti he
 Today, when Dhyanchand dived in the context of the demand for Bharat Ratna, the news of mainstream newspapers did not get the news for the first twenty pages
 ikkaa dukka khabaren hi milin
 It must have happened due to some technical reason or there was a lack in my search method
 zyaadaatar khabaren is saal agast kii thi jinamein yah soochna thi ki grih mantralay ne dhyanchand kaa naam bhi pradhanmantri ko prastaavit kiya he
 This was informed by Home Minister Kiran Rijiju in the Lok Sabha
 tab deshbhar main phir se ummid kii lahar daud gai ki dhyanchand ko bharat ratna milane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 As the news spread, people from BJP leaders to sportspersons started reacting
 milkha singh ne swaagat kiya
 People forgot that even during the UPA government, the Sports Ministry had sent a proposal to Dhyanchand before the Prime Minister's Office
 phir dobaaraa se bheje jane kii kya zarurat thi or ise badha-chadhaakar kyon pesh kiya gaya
 Google Smriti Kosh shows that Manmohan Singh had also considered Dhyanchand's name but everyone knew that Tendulkar was there to meet
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath dhyanchand ko bhi bharat ratna die jane kii purazor vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Ever since the UPA government changed the condition of awarding Bharat Ratna to include players, the demand for awarding Bharat Ratna to Dhyanchand has been vocal
 jaise hi sachin tendulkar ko bharat ratna diye jane kii khabaren aane lageen dhyanchand ko lekar maang tej ho gai

 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne upie sarkaar ko chitthee bhi likhi thi
 In August 2011, an honor ceremony was held in Berlin on the occasion of Vijay's seventy-five years in Berlin
 vahaan shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha ki khilaadiyon main sabase pehle bharat ratna dhyanchand ko milanaa chahie
 It is not that they would find themselves uncomfortable today
 apni sarkaar he to shikaayat kaise karen isliye shivaraj singh chouhan filhal madhya pradesh ke ek or laal atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna milane kii khushi kaa saarvajanik izhaar karte rahe
 Which is also completely correct
 vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna milane se virdohi bhi kush hai
 According to the rule, Bharat Ratna can be given to three people in a year
 yah kayaas lagaana mushkil he ki is baar bhi dhyanchand ko bharat ratna kyon nahin mila
 It is not that Dhyanchand is not in the Prime Minister's attention
 narendra modi ne apane shapath grahan samaaroh main dhyanchand ke bete ashok dhyanchand ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha
 But when it came to award Bharat Ratna, why did Dhyanchand disappear from meditation? or aaj kahin se koi awaz kyon nahin uthi? koi raajnneetik vajah?! Justice S

 In a special conversation with NDTV India, Rama Devi said, 'when she (azam Khan) gave that statement, i was sitting on the pedestal
 vah aisi jagah hai, jahaan sabko baraabar or sambhaav se dekha jaataa he
 i respected that posture
 ajam khan duusari taraf dekhakar bol rahe the, maine unhen asana kii taraf mukhaatib hokar apni baat rakhane ko kaha, lekin iske baad unhone jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya usko main doharaana nahin chaahati hum

 Every man has a mother, sister, daughter and wife
 ajam khan kii tippanee na sirf mahilaon ke liye balki purushon kii garima ko bhi thes pahunchane vaala he

 a film i passionately believe in
 
 
 the last film my father worked on before he left us
 
 
 
 it was his dream to see this film come through
 
 
 
 i couldn't fulfill his dream then
 
 
 
 my spirit was broken
 
 
 
 but today his wish has found a relationship with celluloid
 
 
 
 the story of turbulent relationships and eternal love has found a voice
 
 
 
 the film has been woven, nurtured and visualized by ABHISHEK VARMAN
 
 
 
 and the film Is KALANK! Set in the 40's but it's heart lives on
 
 
 
 
 TOMORROW the journey begins
 
 
 
 
 am excited
 
 
 anxious and emotional about this one
 
 
 i do hope you join us on our path to undying love

 cheteshwar pujaara or captain viraat kohli ke bich tisare wicket ke liye hui 170 ranon kii saajhedaari ne bharat ko malbern match main majboot sthiti main pahunchaa diya
 India declared their first innings by scoring 443 runs at the loss of seven wickets
 match main bharat kii pakad majboot he, lekin iske baavjood phens team india ke captain viraat kohli se naaraaz hai
 It happened that Team India's seventh wicket fell as Ravindra Jadeja on the score of 443 runs
 jiske baad bharat ke captain viraat kohli ne team india kii pari ghoshit kar di
 Rohit Sharma was unbeaten on 63 at the time and presumably had a chance to complete his maiden Test century on Australian soil, but this decision was slipped from his hand by the decision of captain Virat
 kuch phens ne viraat kohli ko rahul dravid kii tarah bhi bataaya, jinhone pakistan ke khilaaf saal 2004 main khele gaye multan test main us samay pari ghoshit kar di jab sachin 194 ranon par naabad the
 During the match, Penn said - Rohit hit a six in MCG and will join Mumbai Indians in IPL Kohli did a dravid on rohit

 Smart and well disguised declaration
 — Alan Farah (@sharsh135)december 27, 2018get with the program! Kohli is trying to shore up Rohit Sharma's average by ensuring a not out
 So then, when there's a twitter or reddit argument about selection next time, his average will look better

 - Partha (@eshers) December 27, 2018 Let us tell you that India declared their first innings by scoring 443 runs at the loss of seven wickets
 din kaa khel samaapt hone tak australia ne bina koi wicket khoe aath ran bana liye hai
 Opener Aaron Finch (3 not out) and Marcus Harris (5 not out) are at the crease
 pujaara or kohli ne guuruuvaar ko pehle din ke score do wicket par 215 ranon se aage khelnaa shuru kiya or shandaar ballebaaji karte hue bharat ke score ko aasaani se 300 se kareeb le gaye
 Stark gave the first blow to the Indian team by dismissing Kohli (82) on a total of 293
 kohli, finch ke haathon lapke gaye
 The captain faced 204 balls in his innings and hit nine fours
 pujaara bhi zyada der tak krij par tik nahin paae or pat kamins ne unhen bold kar pavilion waapas bheja
 Pujara faced 319 balls with 10 fours
 iske baad, ajinkya rahane (34) or rohit sharma (naabad 63) ne bhartiya pari ko aage badhaayaa
 Rahane was dismissed by the in-form spin bowler Nathan Lyon
 chaa gaye viraat- shatak se chuke, lekin records kaa lagaaya ambararahane ko pavilion waapas bhejne ke baad bhi australia kii mushkilen kam nahin huin
 Rohit added 76 runs for the sixth wicket with wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant after Rahane left and took India's score beyond 400
 pant ko 39 ke nijee score par stark ne out kiya
 All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja failed to impress with the bat
 unhen chaar ke nijee score par josh hejalwood ne apana shikaar banaaya

 On Friday, a lawyer from Akbar asked journalist Priya Ramani's friend, 'was she present like a ghost in the room (hotel room where the interview was conducted)?' Nilofar Venkataraman, friend of journalist Priya Ramani, who accused Akbar of sexual harassment, shared the details of the alleged incident which the victim had told her in a Delhi court
 varisht adhivaktaa gita luthra ne nilophar venkataraman se poocha, "kya aap kamare main teesri bhoot thi? phir to aapane vodaka kaa rang bhi dekha hoga
 "ramani had recently accused Akbar of alleged sexual misconduct in a hotel room in Mumbai
 iske baad akbar ne 'me tu' abhiyaan main unka naam ghasite jane ke baad ramani ke khilaaf ek manahani kii shikaayat darj karai thi
 Venkataraman said, "what he told me was so bizarre and unfair that i have a picture of it till date
 "is ghatana ke bare main bataate hue venkataraman ne kaha, "main tab nariman point par thi, jab priya ne mujhe saakshaatkaar se ek ghante pehle milane kaa anurodh kiya, taaki main use saakshaatkaar ke liye taiyaar kar sakuun
 "venkataraman shared the information after the interview and said," Later that night Priya called me on my landline
 vah pareshaan or vyakul lag rahi thi
 When i asked him the reason, he told me that the interview did not go as we had discussed
 saakshaatkaar coffee shop yaa restaraan main nahin hua tha balki use akbar ke kamare main bulaayaa gaya
 "venkataraman told the court," Ramani said that he felt a bit spoiled, because Akbar offered him liquor and he himself was drinking
 unhone ramani ko ishaara karke sofe par unke saath baithne ke liye kaha
 "the then Minister of State for External Affairs Akbar had to resign from his post following the allegations

 The police have taken confession of Vidya's mother Savitri as a confessional process to confirm her role in the murder
 police ne jo bayaan darj kiya he usamen savitri ne kaha ki hatya ke baad uske bete ne phone karke kaha tha ki use do logon kaa katl karne ke liye chintan se ek acchhee rakam milane vaali he

 For Pakistan, the World Cup was the biggest chase in history
 isse pehle 1992 world cap main usne 264 ran banaakar newjiland ko maat di thi
 But this time the score was bigger than that and also the pressure
 to ladkhadana bhi lajimi tha
 For Pakistan, the experienced duo of Ahmed Shehzad and Younis Khan had just added 11 runs in 4 ovens that Mohammed Shami trapped Younis Khan in his bouncer's net
 younis chaahakar bhi gend ke aage se hat nahin paae or gend unke dastaane ko chooti huidhonike paas ja pahunchi
 When Younis returned for 6 runs, less experienced Haris Sohail took the crease
 chathe over main sohail bhi laut gaye hote agar dhoni ne unhen ran out karne kaa mauka naa ganvaaya hota
 Well both the batsmen started playing with a lot of concern in Totem India
 donon ne milakar 18wein over main score 79 tak pahunchaa diya, lekin aswin ke isi over kii aakhri gend ko padhane main haaris sohail chook gaye or gend unke balle se chooti hui suresh raina ke paas ja pahunchi
 Haris scored 36 runs in 48 balls
 ab krij par ahamed shahzad kaa saath dene ke liye captanmisbah-ul-hakthe, donon ne milakar dhire-dhire score ko 23wein over main 100 ke paar pahunchaa diya
 But the 24th over of the innings brought a storm for Pakistan
 umesh yadav ke is over ke duusari gend ahamed shahzad kaa kaam tamaam kar gai
 Jadeja almost caught Shehzad's 47-run innings by catching a missed catch
 do gend baad hi nae ballebaaj shoeb makasuud bhi chalate bane
 On the ball of Yadav, Raina caught his catch in the slip
 makasuud khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 The next batsman was veteran Umar Akmal but his attempt to defend Jadeja's ball brought him back to the pavilion before Pakistan could get some benefit from his experience
 dhoni ne wicket ke peeche kaich pakadaa lekin usapar muhar lagi disizan rivyuu apil se
 Omar also failed to open an account
 103 par 5 wicket ganvaakar pakistan mushkil main funs chukaa tha
 All the hopes of the team now rested on their most experienced batsman Shahid Afridi
 afridi ne bhi kuch der to captain misbah kaa saath nibhaayaa, lekin bade maukon par aksar fail ho jane kii apni aadat se wo paar nahin paa sake
 After scoring 22 runs in the 35th over, Mohammed Shami's attempt to blow the ball outweighed not only Afridi but also Pakistan
 isi over main shami ne wahaab riyaj ko bhi nipta diya
 Riyaz scored 4 runs before Dhoni was caught
 misbah-ul-haq captain kii pari khilne main jute the
 He also completed his half-century in the 37th over
 lekin duusare chor par ek bharosemand saathi kii talash puri naa ho saki
 In the 43rd over of the innings, Mohammad Sharma bowled Mohammad Shami's catch to Yasir Shah
 lekin agali hi gend par umesh yadav ne mid on par koi galati nahin kii
 Yasir Shah scored 13 runs, but before leaving, Pakistan's score was crossed 200 with captain Misbah
 misbah ne ab tej haath dikhaane shuru kiye
 He tried to put pressure on Team India by scoring three fours off three balls of Ravindra Jadeja in the 44th over of the innings but could only try
 baaki kaa kaam mohammad shami ne pari ke 46wein over main puraa kar diya
 In an attempt to blow Shami's ball over mid on, he was caught by Rahane by scoring 76 runs
 ye shami kaa chauthaa wicket tha
 Now only the formality of victory was left
 jise mohit sharma ne 47wein over kii aakhri gend par puraa kar diya
 Sohail Khan was caught by Umesh Yadav for 7 runs and with this Pakistan gifted India another World Cup match
 worldcup main pakistan se kabhi bhi naa haarane kaa bharat kaa record bhi jaisaa kaa taisa bana rahaa

 yah spasht he ki ve police sangrakshan main thi

 The government on Friday defended the decision of the Union Cabinet to approve amendments to keep political parties out of the Right to Information (RTI) Act and said that if the order of the Central Information Commission (CIC) applies in this case So no political party will be able to work
 lekin kaaryakartaaon ne sarkaar ke is kadam kii kadi aalochana kii he
 They say that this will lead to loss of transparency and accountability, which will ultimately lead to loss of democracy
 siaisi ne teen june ko chah rashtriya dalon ko artiai adhinium ke daayre main laane kaa aadesh diya tha
 But the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the amendment
 sanshodhit adhinium main raajnneetik dal iske daayre se baahar ho jaaenge
 This proposal to amend the RTI Act can be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament, which starts on August 5
 centre sarkaar ke is faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kendriya kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha, "sarkaar siaisi kaa sammaan karti he, lekin iske aadesh ko lekar chintit thi
 This order attacks the political system
 log raajnneetik dalon se sabhi tarah kii jaankaree le sakate hai
 Nowhere in the world does this happen
 sabhi raajnneetik dal siaisi ke aadesh ke khilaaf hai
 If implemented, political parties will not be able to function
 " unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke paas do raste rah gaye the, ek to vah siaisi ke aadesh ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kare
 But it takes a lot of time
 isliye artiai adhinium main sanshodhan kaa doosraa rasta chunaa gaya, jo jaldi ho saktaa he
 The hurry is because the order of CIC is related to the process
 ham is mudde par jald prastaav chaahate hai
 He also said, "there is such a general perception that political parties are not accountable
 hamen janata nirvaachit karti he
 Whatever grant we get, we have to disclose it before the Election Commission
 yadi raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaala anudaan aspasht hota to yah sambhav nahin ho paata
 " sibbal ne kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ko 20,000 rupee se adhik kaa jo bhi anudaan miltaa he, uske bare main iskar vibhaag ke samaksh ghoshnaa kerani padati he
 It can also be made public
 yadi raajnneetik dal gopneeyata ke saath kaam karte to yah sambhav nahin ho paata
 He said, "we give details of assets and debts and our expenses to the Election Commission
 isamen puri tarah paardarshita rahati he
 Political parties are neither companies nor trusts
 ye logon ke svaichhik sangh hote hai
 " sibbal ne kaha, "raajnneetik dalon kii niyukti nahin hoti
 We go to the people as part of the electoral process
 sarkari karmchaariyon se alag hamaara nirvachan hota he
 This is the basic difference
 "tippaniyan Activists have however criticized the government's move
 kaamanwealth human ritis inishiative (siechaarai) ke venkatesh nayak ne kaha, "sarkaar ne apane adhikaron kaa durupyog karte hue siaisi ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 He once again failed to ensure transparency and accountability, which he promises in every manifesto
 " RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi said, “this is a cheap decision
 yah nishchit taur par loktantr kaa ksharan he
 They should at least communicate with the people, as it is a matter of their fundamental rights
 " The CIC on June 3 ordered six national parties to be brought under the purview of the RTI Act
 lekin kendriya mantrimandal ne guuruuvaar ko isamen sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di
 The amended act would leave political parties out of its purview
 artiai adhinium main sanshodhan kaa yah prastaav sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh kiya ja saktaa he, jo paanch agast se shuru ho rahaa he
 Defending the central government's decision, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal said, "the government respects the CIC, but was concerned about its order
 yah aadesh raajnneetik vyavastha par hamalaa karata he
 People can get all kinds of information from political parties
 duniya main kahin bhi aisa nahin hota
 All political parties are against the order of the CIC
 yadi ise lagu kiya jaataa he to raajnneetik dal kaam nahin kar paaenge
 "he said that the government was left with two avenues, one to file a petition in the High Court against the order of CIC
 lekin isamen bahut samay lagata
 Therefore, another way of amending the RTI Act was chosen, which may happen soon
 jaldbaaji isliye he, kyonki siaisi kaa aadesh prakriya se sambandhit he
 We want an early resolution on this issue
 unhone yah bhi kaha, "is tarah kii aam dharna he ki raajnneetik partiyaan javabdeh nahin hoti hai
 The people elect us
 hamen jo bhi anudaan miltaa he, uskaa khulaasa hamen nirvachan ayog ke samaksh karnaa hota he
 It would not have been possible if the grant received to political parties was unclear
 " Sibal said that any grant of more than Rs 20,000 to political parties has to be announced before the Income Tax Department
 yah saarvajanik bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 This would not have been possible if political parties acted with secrecy
 unhone kaha, "ham nirvachan ayog ko sampatti evam rinon tathaa apane kharch kaa byora dete hai
 There is complete transparency in this
 raajnneetik dal na to companiyaan hai or na hi nyaas
 These are voluntary associations of people
 " Sibal said, "political parties are not appointed
 ham chunavi prakriya ke tahat logon ke paas jate hai
 We are elected separately from government employees
 yah mul antar he
 "comments kaaryakartaaon ne haalanki sarkaar ke is kadam kii aalochana kii he
 Venkatesh Nayak of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) said, "the government abused its authority to revoke the CIC order
" ve paardarshita evam javabdehi sunishchit karne main ek baar phir vifal rahe, jiskaa vaada ve apni har ghoshnaa-patr main karte hai
 " artiai kaaryakarta shailesh gandhi ne kaha, "yah ek ghatiya nirnay he

 But there is no Leader of the Opposition in the current Lok Sabha
 kyonki iske liye congress ke paas paryaapt sankhya nahin he
 At the same time, no amendment has been made in the Lokpal Act so that the largest opposition party can be included as a member
 yahi kaaran he ki sarkaar ne baithak main congress ko special guest ke taur par aamantrit kiya he
 In fact, to get the status of Leader of the Opposition, it is mandatory to have at least 55 seats or ten percent of the total Lok Sabha member strength

 Bhattarai, born in Bihar, has contributed significantly to the struggle to establish democracy in Nepal
 bhattarai kareeb maheene bhar se biimaar the or kathmandu ke aspataal main unka ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 On Wednesday, he went into a coma and breathed his last at 11:46 pm on Friday
 nepal main 'sant pradhanmantri' kahe jane vaale bhattarai kaa janm bihar ke ramnagar gaanv main hua tha
 His father's family was exiled by the Rana Prime Ministers of Nepal
 bhattarai ne varsh 1942 main 'bharat chodo' andolan main hissaa liya
 He was 18 at the time
 andolan ke dauraan vah kai baar jail gaye
 Bhattarai, who was affected by the freedom movement in India and others deported from Nepal, also hoped to end monarchy in Nepal and establish democracy
 varsh 1950 main kolkata main nirvasit nepali congress kii sthapana kii gai jiskaa uddeshy nepal main sashastr sangharsh shuru karnaa tha
 The Gandhian Bhattarai became part of the armed rebellion in southern Nepal at that time
 nepal lautne par unhen 14 saal ke liye jail bhej diya gaya jahaan shuruaati aath saal unhone bina kisi mukademe ke kaate
 The pro-democracy movement of Bhattarai and his colleagues first met in 1990 when the ban was lifted from political parties
 baad main bhattarai pradhanmantri bane or unhone swatantra evam nishpaksh chunaav karaane ke liye bani antarim sarkaar kaa netritv kiya
 Bhattarai later split from the party due to the party's internal politics and Girija Prasad Koirala's ambitions
 iske nau saal baad logon ke bich bhattarai kii lokapriyata ko pahachaanate hue koirala ne 1999 main hue chunaav se ek din pehle bhattarai ko party main waapas laane kii ghoshnaa kii
 The party won the election after this clever decision by Koirala
 tab bhattarai 1999 main duusari baar pradhanmantri bane lekin koirala ke dobaaraa netritv karne kii ichha ke chalate unhen nau maheene baad hi istipha dena padaa
 Three years later, Bhattarai quit active politics and withdrew from the party after four years

 ab aap jaananaa chaah rahe honge ki ye marijon ke liye 'ek din kii chandani or phir andheri raat vaali' vaali kahawat kaise charitaarth hui
 Actually, it happened that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanatharvivavar visited SRN Hospital to inspect
 sab kuch chakachak dikhaane ke liye jila prashasan ne siem ke daure se ek din pehle hi aanan-fanan main ek tent house se 20 cooler kiraye par mangaaye or aspataal main marijon ke ward main lagava die
 From Saturday evening till Sunday afternoon, the patients got cold air of coolers
 marij bhi hairaan ki ye achaanak kayapalat kaise ho gaya
 The patients then started thanking the government and the authorities in their hearts that they were taken care of to get rid of this terrible heat
 lekin ye raahat thodi der kii hi sabit hui
 After the Chief Minister left, the coolers of the rent were removed and brought back to the tent house
 prashasan ne ye dhyaan rakhaa ki kahin kiraye par mangaaye culeron par tents house ke naam parmukhyamantri keenjar naa pad jaae
 For this, where the name of the tent house was put, the stickers of Junior Doctors Association were affixed on it
 aspataal main kahin gandagi naa dikhe, iskaa bhi vishesh khyaal rakhaa gaya
 When the Chief Minister reached SRN Hospital on Sunday, the administration did not allow the media to go inside
 esaren aspataal main marijon ke vaaste ek din ke liye kiraye ke cooler lagavane kaa maamla tool pakadaney ke baad ab jaanch karaane kii baat kahi ja rahi he

 According to Harbhajan, 'I stayed in the ITBP camp and i have seen with my own eyes how bad the situation is there
 naa upar jane kaa rasta bachaa he or naa neeche jane kaa koi saadhan he
 Until three days ago, where there was parking, there is nothing left now

 As we all know that the film is the PM Narendra Modi biopic of the Prime Minister of the country
 is film kii kahani main modi ke bachapan se lekar 2014 main unke pradhanmatri banane tak kaa safar he
 In which it is shown that in childhood Modi used to sell tea
 tirange or army ko jahaan dekhte vahiin celut karte the
 When he grew up, he left the world and became a monk and amidst the mountains, the religious teacher told him that he should serve the country and the people, and after coming back, he started propagating the Sangh and slowly went on to become the Prime Minister
 is film ki kahani par main koi tippanee nahin karunga kyonki jo modi ko pasand karte hai unke liye ye kahani sahi he or jo unhen pasand nahin karte unke liye ye kahani galat lekin film dekhne ke baad main ye jarur kahuunga ki ye byopic nahin balki ek gungan he modi kaa
 The world knows that Modi is married, it is a different matter that for some reason he separated from his wife
 lekin is film main dikhaaya gaya he kii jab inaki shaadi kii baat ho rahi thi tabhi ye sanyasi ban gaye
 Even after becoming the Chief Minister, when Modi goes home, he dishes in the kitchen of the house
 film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to bahut hi gini-chuni hai
 Some scenes in the first half of the film look good
 cinemetography acchhee he or production vailu bhi thik he
 But the script of the film is very weak
 lambey-lambey bor karne vaale seen hai
 Omung Kumar is a very weak director
 vivek oberoi is film kii sabase kamazor kadi hai jinhone narendra modi kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Vivek Oberoi is not engaged in any angle by Narendra Modi
 modi jaisi shakhsiyat kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye vaisaa atmivishwaas chehre par najar aana chahie jo kabhi bhi najar nahin aayaa
 That is, Vivek's acting is very weak
 film kisi bhi hisse main baandh nahin paati he phir wo chaahe likhaai kaa hissaa ho, nirdesan kaa hissaa ho, kahani kaa hissaa ho yaa phir abhinay kaa hissaa ho
 So my rating for the film is 1 star

 reports ke mutabik company Mi 8X launch kar sakati he jo Mi Note siries ko aage le jayega
 It is being told that Snapdragon 710 will be given Qualcomm's new processor in this smartphone
 kuch licd dizin ke mutabik is smartphone ke rier main fingerprint scinar nahin diya gaya he jo aam taur par shaomi ke smartfones main diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, vertical dual rear camera will be given in it
 report ke mutabik rier fingerprint scinar na de kar company is baar in disple fingerprint scinar de sakati he
 Because since Vivo, companies are preparing to give these display fingerprint scanners in their smartphones or rather to follow the trend
 chini micro bloging website vibo par Mi 8X keekathith live tasviren li hui hai
 Blue and white color can be seen here
 ek yujar ne vibo par hi company ke siio lee june kii tasviir share kii he jinke haath main smartphone he or bataaya ja rahaa he ki wo Mi 8X hi he
 Because Xiaomi currently does not have any smartphone in the market that has a vertical camera, but does not have a rear fingerprint scanner
 baharhaal abhi yah saaf nahin he ki ise launch kab kiya jayega
 But in India on August 8, the company is preparing to launch Android One smartphone Mi A2
 ise haal hi main global launch kiya gaya tha or ab yah bharat aa rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the Mi A1 has been the popular smartphone of the company and hence users have great expectations from the Mi A2
 dekhan dilachasp hoga ki kya yah smartphone logon kii ummiido par khara utarataa he yaa nahin
 Murder cases are increasing day by day due to illicit relations
 haal hi main aise kai maamle saamne aae hai, jisamen avaidh sambandhon ke kaaran rishton main daraar aa gai or baat hatya tak pahunch gai
 Another such case has come up
 dilli ke osmanpur ilaake main patni ne apane premi ke saath milakar pati ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Police has arrested 3 people
 aropiyon ke naam priti jain rahul jain or vijay he
 Preity (32) had an affair with Rahul (30) and was married to Subodh Jain (42)
 subodh kii laash 1 may ko uske ghar main mili thi
 Preeti tried hard to mislead the police, but the postmortem report showed that Subodh died of strangulation
 iske baad police ne aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 When did Huapulis get information on May 1 that a person was lying unconscious in the house at street number 4 in Usmanpur area
 police jab ghatnasthal par pahunchi to paaya ki subodh bistar par achet haalat main pade hue hai
 The wardrobe of the room was opened and many items were lying outside
 subodh ko turant jepisi aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan use laayaa hua mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The body was then brought to GTB Hospital for postmortem
 police ne do may ko exiaar darj kar maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di
 During interrogation, Preeti said that Subodh has fainted many times before
 lekin postmortem report main kaha gaya ki mritak ko galaa ghontkar maaraa gaya
 How the plan was made When the police showed strictness, the truth came out
 priti ne kabool kiya ki vah rahul jain se akasar baaten karti thi
 Rahul said that Preity was not happy with her relationship with Subodh
 iske baad donon ne use jaan se maarane kaa plan banaaya
 Rahul enlisted the help of his friend Vijay for this
 teenon 29 april ko mili, jahaan priti ne ghar ke main get kii ek chaabi rahul ko di
 She then left Subodh with sleep medicine and left the house with the child
 subodh ke maarane ke liye rahul ne vijay ko dedh lakh rupee die the
 After this, Vijay entered the house and strangled Subodh and killed him and ran away from Sonipat, spreading the laptop, mobile and wardrobe items as per the plan
 jab police ne khojbin shuru kii to vijay pakadaa gaya
 Also, the car used in the crime was recovered
 ye maamle bhi rahe charchaa main-- uttarakhand or upi ke purv siem endi tiwari ke bete rohit shekhar kii pichley dinon unki patni apurva ne hatya kar di thi
 From the beginning, the needle of suspicion was moving towards Apoorva
 hatya kii raat donon ke bich hathapayee hui thi, jiske baad apurva ne galaa dabaakar rohit kii hatya kar di
 On April 28, near Rupinder Chandel's body near Gaur City, Noida Extension, the body was recovered from his car
 unki goli markar hatya kii gai thi
 Police said that Rupinder was murdered by his wife along with his lover
 police ne is maamle main teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 In the past, Shahban, who runs a coaching center in Kanpur, got fed up with his wife's antics and killed her
 phir khud ko jaan se maar daalaa
 She wrote in the diary that her wife Namra used to talk to the boys on the phone and beat the children with her first wife
 donon ke bich gaali-galoch bhi khub hoti thi
 After receiving signal signals in Bangla and Urdu language on the indo-bangladesh border during the last few months, there is a doubt whether the extremists are using this non-traditional way for their dialogue
 prashasan ne kuta bhashaa vaale in signlon ke maddenjar ham radio operataron ko choubison ghante duty par tainaat kar diya he
 Such signals were first discovered in June
 tab in radio signlon or anaadhikrut radio sanvaadon ko shaukia ham radio operataron ne bashirhaat or sunderbans kshetra main pakadaa tha
 The operators informed the center when these code signals in Bengali and Urdu languages came under control
 iske baad unhen ek antarrashtriya nigaraanee centre main bulaayaa gaya or signlon par najar rakhane ko kaha gaya
 The comments ab 23 ham radio operataron kaa ek dal choubison ghante duty par tainaat he or in radio signlon kii vaastavik lokation kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 ) Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has tried to handle the vitiated atmosphere within the party with the statement of actor Raza Murad
 shivaraj ne twitor par narendra modi kii tarifon ke pul baadhante hue unki tulana sardaar vallabh bhai patel se kar daali
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat is usually compared to Shivraj Singh Chauhan in BJP
 party main adwani se lekar kai bade netaa modi se zyada tarif shivaraj singh chouhan kii kar chuke hai
 But Shivraj also knows that the wind is blowing in favor of Modi at this time and it is also true that the wind that does not flow with the wind does not blow for long
 isiilie shivaraj singh ke is twit kaa kuch or matlab bhi nikaala ja rahaa he
 In fact, two days earlier, Raza Murad had pulled up Modi and praised Shivraj Singh for not wearing a hat at an event
 khaas baat he ki ye sari baaten shivaraj singh chouhan kii ankhon ke saamne hui lekin phir bhi madhya pradesh ke mukhiya chup rah gaye the
 Shivraj remained silent on the occasion, but questions were raised on his silence that whether Shivraj Singh's mind is not meeting with Modi? According to sources, it was also necessary to put a stop to these questions that were arising just before the election campaign
 lihaaja shivaraj singh chouhan par dabaav badhaayaa gaya
 It is believed that Shivraj Singh Chauhan, under pressure, praised Modi so that the matter becomes equal

 Shiva said, 'I told China that there was no need for what he said, because i did not talk about politics

 "enough of what he said" He claimed that China told him that he could not remain silent if such a comment was made

 bhaajapa ne ravivaar ko patna main nitish kumaar dwaara rajd supremeo lalu prasad ko phone karke rajyasabha upachunaav main jadyu ummidavaaron kaa samarthan ke kadam kii aalochana kii he
 Senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi accused Nitish of repeatedly slipping words such as morality, principle and self-respect for the politics of power and convenience into a bad coin
 susheel ne kaha ki nitish maheene bhar pehle tak lalu ko lathi main tel pilaane kii raajnneeti kaa pratik or bihar main 15 saal ke jangal raaj ke liye jimmedaar bataate huye janata se laalaten phodne kii apil kar rahe the
 But now they are seeking support from Lalu for saving the JDU government and winning the Rajya Sabha candidates of the party
 unhone nitish se poocha ki isse naitikta kahaan bachi he? kya lalu ko phone kar samarthan maangane ke baad bhi nitish kaa swabhimaan or siddhant bachaa rah gaya he? Sushil alleged that as Chief Minister, Nitish conspired to recognize 13 RJD mlas as separate factions in the assembly in violation of the rules of the anti-defection law
 kya vah sansadeey aacharan kii naitikta ke anukool tha? He alleged that again when the support of RJD came to save the government, the decision of recognition of a separate faction was returned to the Speaker of the House
 naitikta to donon baar taar-taar hui, lekin jubaan par naitikta kii rat jari rahi
 Sushil alleged that Nitish continued to do politics of non-congressism, but to save the government by putting this principle in the 'deep freezer', he called the political advisor of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Ahmed Patel and got the support of four Congress mlas
 
 congress ne na to bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya or na hi koi vishesh package, lekin nitish ne saare siddhant bhuulakar usee congress kaa samarthan le liya
 He said that Nitish Kumar should tell that politics of which principle is the burden of by-election on the people by resigning from two BJP and three RJD mlas? susheel ne aarope lagaaya ki jis lalan singh ne kisaan mahapanchayat bulaakar nitish kumaar ko apni takat dikhaai or pichley vidhaan sabha chunaav main rajg ummidavaaron ke khilaaf kaam kiya
 He was made an MLC and then a cabinet minister after losing the Lok Sabha elections
 kya yahi siddhant kii raajnneeti he? He said that Nitish Kumar remained with the BJP for 17 years, when communalism was not an issue
 apane ahankaar ko siddhant bataakar unhone gathbandhan toda or bihar ke vikaas ko patari se utaar diya
 Sushil said that the people will also give a tough fight to both Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar in next year's assembly elections in the state, who are doing anti-development politics by putting a veil on corruption, chanting morals, communalism and principles
