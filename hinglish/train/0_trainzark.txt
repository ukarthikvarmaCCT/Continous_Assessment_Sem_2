 co / ggez3nb2vr haal hi main, dilli main ek serial repist ko giraftaar kiya gaya, jo maasoom bacchiyon ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaata tha
 But let us tell you that the safety of girls is a danger not only in the country's capital, but in the whole of India
 enciarabi dwaara jari haalia aankade behad daraavne or pareshaan karne vaale hai
 This letter of a principal written on the rape will open your eyes
 You will be surprised to know that only those cases which have been lodged or complained in some form or the other are shown in the data released by the NCRB
 yani, bacchiyon ke khilaaf aparaadh kii jo surat najar aa rahi hai, uskaa vaastavik cheharaa or bhi bhayanak he
 There are also thousands of cases of crime, which are not complained
 nirbhaya cese : har maa ko padhani chahie ye chittheekho diya bachapanjaari aankadon kii maane to saal 2015 membeciyon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhake 94,172 maamle darj kiye gaye
 Of these, 12 percent ie 10,854 rapes were reported
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki desh main har 48 minute par koi ek bacchee havas kaa shikaar banati he
 Apart from the increasing crime against children, the statistics on other types of sexual crimes against children are also shocking
 report ke anusaar saal 2015 main 8,390 aise maamle dekhne ko mili, jisamen iradatan bacchiyon kii sheeltaa bhang kii gai
 As many as 14,913 cases were registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POSCO) Act
 rape peedita kii umrenciarabi dwaara jari haalia report ke anusaar jis umr membeciyon ko apane sharirake bare main bhi puri jaankaree nahin hoti, is choti umr main hi un par vahashi aparaadhiyon kii najar padane lagati he
 According to the data, in 2015, 306 girls below the age of 6 years were raped
 jabaki 6 se 12 ayuvarg kii 1008 bacchiyaan havas kii shikaar baniin
 Cases of rape were reported with 3405 and 4114 girls in the age group of 12 to 16 and 16 to 18 respectively
 ek aise bachche kii kahani jise uskaa teacher nanga karke padhaata tha
 
 
 Who is at risk? According to NCRB data, children are the victims of the lust of the neighbors
 iske baad rishtedaaron, mata-pita ke ko-varkar, anjaane logon dwaara unka yon shoshan hota he
 Uttar Pradesh is the most insecure place in this sense
 iske baad kramash: pashchim bengal, gujarat, karnataka or tamilnadu he

 Sawan's Monday is considered infallible for problems of marriage and progeny

 Questioning the government's stand on Rohingya refugees, senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi said that Rohingya refugees are being discriminated against
 mahatma gandhi ke desh main ashishnutaa kahaan tak sahi he
 Tarun Gogoi is a senior Congress leader and has been the Chief Minister of Assam three times
 unka kahana ki dharm ke aadhaar par sharnaarthiyon ke saath bhedbhaav ho rahaa he or yah vah log hangine par atyaachaar ho rahaa he
 Gogoi said that if his human rights are being violated in his country, then he is fleeing to India for fear that if the refugee comes, it will be illegal, but he is not deliberately coming here
 assam ke purv siem tarun gogoi kaa kahana he ki yah mahatma gandhi or ashok kaa desh he, hamen udaartaa dikhaani hogi
 He said that the attitude of the government in the affidavit given by the government in the Supreme Court is unfair
 bharat sarkaar 2015 main citigen amendament act laai jisamen bharat ke aasapaas ke deshon main jo bhi alpsankhyak sharnaarthi aayega usko ham naagarikta denge
 He said that the Indian government is polarizing and Myanmar is also a neighboring country on the Rohingya issue, if refugees are coming from there, why should they be discriminated against, whether they are Muslims
 rohingya muslimon ke paksh lete hue gogoi ne kaha ki ham to yah nahin kah rahe kirohingya ko sthai naagariktadeni chahie, lekin jab tak unke desh main unke liye vaataavaran anukool naa ho, surakshit naa ho, tab tak rohingya ko aashray di sakati he
 Gogoi said the Indian government should talk to the government of Myanmar to repatriate the Rohingya
 sarkaar ke halafname main tarun gogoi ne kaha ki agar koi rohingya aatanki he to aap uske khilaaf karrwai kiijie, usko giraftaar kiijie abhi tak to koi aisa shaks nahin aayaa, agar he bhi to aap uske khilaaf karrwai kiijie, lekin mahilaon or bacchon ko bhi usee katghare main kyon khadaa kar rahe hai, jin bacchon ke paas naa hathiyaar he naa barood, unki kya galati ho sakati he
 After allegations of scam in DDCA, the Delhi government has now accused an officer of seeking sex in exchange for selection
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki adhikari ne cricket khilaadiyon ke sellection ke badale yah demand rakhi thi
 According to IANS, Kejriwal told NDTV, 'A senior journalist received a call and said that his wife was told that if she wanted her son to be selected in the team, she would have to have sex in return
 ' haalanki kejariwal ne patrkaar kaa naam nahin bataaya he
 'sex racket along with financial irregularities' After the Finance Minister Arun Jaitleeper alleged financial irregularities, Kejriwal said that wrong things like sex racket are happening in DDCA
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko tay karnaa chahie ki 'kya vittamantri arun jetali ko bachaane ke liye didisie kii jaanch ko amaanya kiya janaa chahie yaa nahin
 "I am not afraid of the CBI", the Delhi Chief Minister said that the BJP was using all central agencies against them
 unhone kaha, 'kejariwal sibiai se darataa nahin he, mere khilaaf koi bhijaanch kara lee jaae
 He said that he has no regrets for calling the Prime Minister a coward and a psychopath
 unhone kaha ki vahadidisie maamleka puri tarah pardaafash karke rahenge
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala has attacked Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar over the statement made on actor Aamir Khan
 parrikar ne shanivaar ko kaha tha aamir khan ke desh chhodane vaale ashishnutaa ke bayaan ahankaar se bharaa bayaan bataaya tha
 Surjewalane tweeted that Manohar Parrikar proves that this is a conspiracy to suppress Dalitha and minorities
 kya ye 'raaj dharm' ho saktaa he? surajevaala ne ye sawaal bhi uthaaya, 'kya manohar parrikar kaa kaam bharat kii pakistan jaise hamalaa karne waalon kii raksha karnaa he yaa apane abhinayta aamir khan jaise apane desh ke naagarik ko dhamkee dena he?'parrikarne pune main siachin par marathi patrkaar-lekhakar nitin gokhale kii pustak kaa vimochan ke kaarykram main kaha tha, ek abhinayta ne kaha he ki unki patni bharat se baahar janaa chaahati he
 This is a snobbish statement
 yadi main garib hum or meraa ghar chota he to main tab bhi apane ghar se pyaar karuunga or hameshaa use bangala banane kaa sapana dekhuunga
 '
 @manoharparrikar's statement proves a concerted conspiracy to curb all dissent, hound Dalits & Minorities
 Can this be the 'raj Dharma'? It takes courage
 aise log, jo log desh ke khilaaf bolte hai, unhen is desh ke logon dwarapath padhaane kii jarurat he
 'is @ manoharparrikarjob to protect India from external aggressors like Pakistan or threaten fellow countrymen like actor Aamir Khan? - Randeep s Surjewala (@rssurjewala) July 31, 2016 bharat jaise loktantric desh main chunaav hameshaa hi ek jatil prakriya rahe hai
 The Election Commission uses electronic voting machines (evms) to simplify this
 taaki chunaav kii prakriya jaldi puri ho sake
 Although political people have often been questioned about the transparency of evms, it is not yet officially said that evms can be hacked
 chunaav ayog ne bhi is baat ko nakaar diya he
 The voter has some information about evms
 masalan vot kaise dena he? yah kaam kaise karti he? lekin zyaadaatar logon ko yah pataa nahin hota he ki EVM main kis party ke candidet ko kis sthaan par rakhana he
 Which candidate will be named at which number? After all, in which order the candidate is named in the machine? Before giving this information, let us tell you how EVM works? In India, after the first use of EVM in 1982, till the seventies in our country elections were held in ballot paper
 desh main pehali baar may 1982 main chunaav main iviem kaa istemaal hua
 People from EVM cast votes at 50 polling stations of Paravur Assembly in Kerala
 par chunaav haarane vaale ummidavaar e
 C
 jose ne iviem se chunaav or rigelt ko court main chunauti de di thi
 On which the court ordered re-election, but did not anticipate tampering in the machine
 saal 1983 ke baad kuch varshon tak iviem kaa istemaal nahin hua
 The Supreme Court had ordered a legal provision for this
 disambar 1988 main sansad ne kanoon main sanshodhan kiya or repragentation of pipal act, 1951 main section 61e ko joda
 This section gave the Election Commission the strength to use voting machines in elections
 1989-90 main jin iviem kaa nirmaan hua tha, unka istemaal november 1998 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main hua
 It was used as an experiment in 5 assembly segments in Madhya Pradesh, 6 in Rajasthan and 6 in the National Capital Territory of Delhi
 iske baad chote-mote chunaav iviem ke jariye hote rahe
 2004 EVM Kranti: Elections were held from 2004 evms in India
 desh main 14veen loksabhaa ke chunaav main iviem kaa istemaal hua
 17 at polling stations
 5 lakh mashin rakhi gayi
 Since 2004, all elections have been evms
 kaise iviem kaam karti he?ek iviem do unit se milakar banati he
 First control unit and second balloting unit
 donon unit 5 meter lambii cabel se judi hoti hai
 The control unit is kept in the booth with the polling officer while the balloting unit is inside the voting machine which is used by the voters
 control unit ke liye jis program kaa istemaal hota he, use ek microchip main daalaa jaataa he
 After inserting it into the micro chip, the program cannot be read, copied, nor can it be altered by tampering
 chunaav hone ke baad matdaan adhikari 'close' batan ko dabaakar iviem ko band kar detaa he
 After pressing the 'close' button the EVM shuts down completely and no button works after that
 iske baad prisiding officer donon unit ko alag kar dete hai
 The votes are secured in the balloting unit
 iske baad counting ke vakt iviem kii 'result' batan dabaate hi isamen pade mat disple ho jate hai
 This button is sealed and does not work without pressing the close button
 ek iviem main kitne candidats?ek iviem main zyada se zyada 64 ummidavaaron ke liye voting kii ja sakati he
 That is, the name of 64 candidates can be entered in a machine
 darasal, ek belatting unit main 16 candidats ke liye voting kii ja sakati he or ek control unit se 4 se zyada balting unit ko nahin joda saktaa he
 If the number of candidates is more than 64, then the Election Commission may have to conduct elections from the ballot
 vahiin 2013 ke baad bani M3 iviem main 384 candidats kaa naam feet kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the Election Commission has not included it in its fleet yet
 kitne vot daale ja sakate hai?ek iviem main sirf 3,840 vot daale ja sakate hai
 Actually, the number of voters at a polling station in India does not exceed 1,500
 is hisaab se ek iviem ek matdaan centre ke liye paryaapt hoti he
 Where evms are made? evms are designed by the Election Commission in collaboration with two public sector companies - Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore and Electronic Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Hyderabad
 iviem ko kaaphi kavayad ke baad antim rup diya gaya he
 Its samples were tested several times and field trials were carried out on a large scale
 ab iviem kaa nirmaan biiel or siiel dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 How much did an EVM cost? When the machines were purchased in 1989–1990, the price of an EVM at that time was Rs 5,500
 haalanki shuruyaat main kaaphi kharch karnaa padaa lekin ballat ke mukaable yah sasta tha
 Millions of ballets had to be spent a lot on printing, storing and transporting them
 bailat ke rakrakhaav ke liye badi sankhya main karmchaariyon ko tainaat karnaa padataa tha
 That is, the ballot overall was a very expensive deal
 iviem main invilt betry hoti he
 There is also no need of electricity to operate it
 kis candidet kaa naam kis number par?hamane aapako bataaya ki iviem kya hoti he? kaise kaam karti he? kitne vot daale jate hai or isamen kitne candidats kaa naam feet ho saktaa he? aadi aadi
 Now a question arises that in EVM which candidate will be named at which number? How is it fixed? Recently, CPM candidate Kanhaiya Kumar from Begusarai Lok Sabha seat had appealed to win them by advertising in newspapers
 vigyaapan main yah bhi likhaa tha ki EVM kii ek number kaa batan dabaakar vot den
 Since then, people have also raised a lot of questions on social media about how Kanhaiya knows that he will get first place in EVM
 jabaki yah chunaav ayog tay karata he
 On different methods for different states, some people said that it is decided according to the party
 vahiin kuch ne kaha ki alphabet yani A,B,C,D ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 However, it is not like that
 iviem main candidet kaa naam us rajya kii bhashaa se tay hota he
 That is, if that state is Hindi speaking, then the names will be written in EVM according to the Hindi alphabet
 hindi varnmaala kii devanagari lipi main k, kha, ga, gha se naam tay hote hai
 That is why Kanhaiya Kumar sought votes by placing himself at number one in EVM in the advertisement
 is seat par bijepi ke giriraaj singh or mahagathbandhan ne tanwir hasan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 The letters of the names of Giriraj and Tanveer Hasan are the later letters from Kanhaiya in the Hindi alphabet
 EVM or vvpativiema kii security ko lekar jab sawaal uthne lage to Election commission ne iske saath voter verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) lagane kaa nirnay kiya
 After putting it, the voter votes the slip of the candidate who appears in the VVPAT machine
 haalanki yah parchi voter ko nahin di jaati he or na hi is par vot dene vaale kii pahchaan ankit hoti he

 *** pashchim bengal ke muslim samoohon ne imaamon kaa masikbhattattkaal badhaane kii maang ko lekarkolkatamein buudhvaar ko virodh pradarshan kiya
 In fact, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced a grant of Rs 28 crore for Durga Puja organizers a few weeks ago
 isi ko dekhte hue muslim samoohon ne imaamon ke vetan badhaane kii bhi maang kii
 Hundreds of Ulama and Muslim youths led by All Bengal Minority Youth Federation (ABMYF) gathered in central Kolkata and raised slogans against the Mamata Banerjee government
 unhone mukhyamantri parmuslim samudayase kiye vaadon ko puraa nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Also be warned that these protests are the beginning of protests and will be continued further
 ABMYF ke mahasachiv mo
 Kamrujzam told India Today, the imams' allowance should be increased first, then the government should think of giving grants to the Durga Puja organizers
 mamata banerjee ne apni raajnneeti ke liye BJP kii line le lee he
 ABMYF demands that the allowance of Imams should be doubled
 philhal kareeb 56,000 imaamon or muajjinon ko kramash: 2500 rupee or 1000 rupee bhatta miltaa he
 Mamta Banerjee had announced this allowance in her first term as Chief Minister
 camerujjamaa ne kaha, ‘ham kisi bhi dharmik makasad ke liye sarkari paise die jane kaa samarthan nahin karte
 Mamta Banerjee is making payments to the Imams from Waqf Board funds, this is not government money
 haalanki trinmul congress (TMC) isse puraa raajnneetik laabh lene kii koshish kar rahi he
 Kamruzzamma, who was once a TMC supporter, said, "29% of Bengal's Muslim population is completely deprived
" hamen mamata banerjee se bahut ummiden thim lekin ham niraash he
 They cheated us
 unhone hamaara sirf vot bank kii tarah istemaal kiya
 The influential Ulema Toha Siddiqui, associated with Furfura Sharif of West Bengal, fully supported Mamata Banerjee in the 2011 election
 ab wo mamata banerjee ko aagaah karte hue kehete hai ki muslim voton ko apni jaagir kii tarah naa samajhen
 Siddiqui said, 'we have never spoken to Mamata Banerjee, nor will we ever
 ham sirf unheen ke samarthan ke liye bolenge jo sach ke liye khadey hai
 There are 4 crore Muslims in Bengal
 unhen ye nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki ham kabhi bhi dharmanirpeksh vikalp ke taur par rajya main congress yaa sipiiem ko unki kabron se nikaal kar unamem dobaaraa jaan phoonk sakate hai
 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has said on this development that Mamata Banerjee only focuses on appeasement politics
 ghosh ne india today se kaha, unhone muslimon ko khush karne ke liye bhatta (imaamon ko) dena shuru kiya

 unhone pehla twit kiya tha ki rajasthan main congress party kii sarkaar ne ek baar phir basapa ke vidhayakon ko todakar gaiyr-bharosemand evam dhokheybaaj party hone kaa pramaan diya he

 saavarkar sahab ke liye to bauddhik ghamaasan khub hua
 With great difficulty, he was able to make a place in the pictures
 vaajapeyi sahab indira nahin ho sakate or naa hi chachaa nehru
 Shastri ji, who has descended on the earth with Gandhiji, moves to the same number
 haalanki shastri ji congressi rahe hai par unki jayanti chalate-chalate man jaati he
 Like Gandhiji, there is no need to pray for all religion
 vaise congress ke andar rahakar bhi duusare darje kaa congressi bananaa ek alag tarah kaa anubhav he
 It has many casualties
 gandhi, nehru se itar party ke andar inkaa astitv barua, mishra, kesari, munshi, mukherjee, raav jaisi hoti hogi
 Khair Saheb came to power for four days and the policy of annexation took place
 maaf kijiega, vistaaravaadi
 
 
 No, started the policy of raising the family

 In full Congress style

 We have never even assumed that Gandhi can be anyone other than us
 shuru se gandhi congressi bhale hi rahe hon, wo swatantraaa prapti ke baad congress ko khatm karne kii ichha rakhte the
 By the way, if we fulfill his wish, then our whole body will become trembling by thinking what our identity would be
 ye naye pradhanmantri jo pradhanmantri banane se pehle kabhi sansad kaa munh tak nahin dekhe the, mere gandhi jayanti manaane ke saare rang-dhang ko hi badal diya
 Now they all became Gandhi
 aashcharya he, jis gandhi ko kabhi ye doshi tehraate the wo ekaek inke priy ho gaye? gandhi sabake ho gaye? matlab gandhi ab bijepi ke bhi ho gaye? sarvadharm kii jagah par swatchta abhiyaan chalegaa? ab gandhi par congress kaa copirite samaapt
 Gandhi was the biggest capital of our party
 hamane apana sabakuch unheen se lekar shuru kii thi
 People started separating from us
 congress se saikadon partiyon kaa janm hua lekin kisi ne bhi mere gandhi ko hamase nahin chhina
 But the party which did not break away from us took its hold on Gandhi
 vah bhi bina kisi jang ke
 
 
 Neither ideological, nor violent
 sara parivartan ahimsa ke raste
 So, if Gandhiji talked about ending the Congress, forming a new party and gaining power, would that party be BJP? Or that Gandhi shunned us for being from a particular state? Well Gandhi has been such a great personality, whose identity was of global status, how long would we be able to keep him tied
 aaj na kal to hamase alag hona hi tha
 The country is so big, the population is so big
 gandhi ko maanane vaale sirf 44 siton kii party nahin ho sakati
 The whole country considers them
 wo to sabakaa he
 But the sad thing is that now only our party will not get political benefit in the name of Gandhi
 ab ek or hissedaar aa gaye hai
 In this case we could not even recover now that an attempt was made to circumvent the martyrdom of our Durga i
e
 Indira
 yah saraasar hamaari party ke saath anyaay tha
 Patel was ours
 humlog har saal unki jayanti par vigyaapan to de hi dete the phir ye daudane vaali baat kahaan se aa gai
 Ran the whole country
 kitna badhiya subah-subah snaan-dhyaan kar shakti sthal pahunchate the or indira ji ko yaad karte the
 His party also cut him short
 ab sunne main yah aa rahaa he ki chachaa nehru bhi hamase chhin lenge or indira kaa janmdin bhi apane tareeke se manaayenge
 It is also getting information that a committee formed by Manmohan Singh, which included Sonia Gandhi to celebrate Nehru's birthday, was dissolved and a new committee has been formed
 sonia gandhi nahin he us cameti main
 After all, how can this happen? nehru to hamaare parivaar ke the, vah kab se bijepi ke hone lage
 Our throne was taken away from us, now our ancestors are also being grabbed
 parivartan prakruti kaa niyam he lekin koi raajnneetik party apana chaal, cheharaa or charitra is tareeke se badal legi, yakeen nahin ho rahaa
 i am also thinking, when all our ancestors belong to BJP, then what will i gain by strolling in the streets of Congress alone? Like Vadra sir, if i do something in anger, that too is not good
 unke liye to puri fimali saath main hogi, meraa koun hoga
 i can't even remove the mic, they even went to speak to turn off the camera and delete the footage, what will i do? Some journalists ask friends, if Rahul Baba goes to BJP, then i should also think of changing my face
 aakhirkaar rajeev ji kii jayanti par bhi to kuch karnaa hi hoga

 kul milakar taiyaari banaras se upi jeetne kii he or party ne kanoon ke mudde ke saath duusare kai muddon par samaajawaadee sarkaar ke saath bijepi ko bhi gherna shuru kiya he
 Sheila Dixit says that the condition of UP today is very bad
 upi sabase bada state he vikaas antim shrenee main he
 Law and order is not right, whatever happened in Bulandshahr is very shameful
 ham isaki ninda karte he
 If this kind of incident happens, then you can understand how is the law and order situation
 yahaan bijli nahin he, lihaaja berogari he
 Congress was ruled 27 years ago
 hamaara naaraa bhi he '27 saal bura haal'
 It hurts the heart

 UP is the largest state, development is in the last category

 We condemn it

 There is no electricity, hence unemployment
 27 saal pehle congress kaa shashan tha
 Our slogan is '27 years bad condition'
 ye dil main chot pahunchaata he
 This is why we are from Uttar Pradesh too

 Second use of toilets is also being done in Madhya Pradesh
 yah baat aapke man main sawaal khadaa kar sakati he, magar hakeekat yahi he
 Here is a new case of using the toilet as a kitchen
 shivpuri jile ke karaira vikaskhand main he silanagar pokhar main ek anganwari centre main bacchon kaa khaanaa banane ke liye rasoi kaa sthaan nahin hone par nayaa tarika khoj nikaala gaya or shauchalay ko hi rasoi main badal diya gaya
 Food for the children is regularly cooked in this toilet and children are served
 anganwari centre kii kaaryakarta rajkumaari yogi ne kaha ki yah baat sahi he ki yahaan par shauchalay ke ek hisse main khaanaa banataa he, kyonki unke paas khaanaa banane ke liye alag se koi sthaan hi nahin he
 She says that she has asked the group several times to provide other places for cooking, but this did not happen
 majaburi main unhen shauchalay bhawan kaa istemaal khaanaa banane ke liye karnaa pad rahaa he
 Project Officer of the Women and Child Development Department, Priyanka Weaver, also admitted to having food in the toilet and said that the toilet built is half-incomplete and due to lack of water there is no use as a toilet
 isse pehle, shivpuri jile ke badaravaas main bhi do maamle aise saamne aae the, jab vahaan par kuch logon ke gharon par banaae gaye shauchalayon main kiraane kii dukaan or rasoi bana lee gai thi
 There have been cases of use of toilets in other parts of the state as well, but this is the first time that the toilets are being used as a kitchen for the children of Anganwadi center
 silanagar pokhar ke anganwari centre main jab bhojan shauchalay main pakataa he to jaahir he anganwari ke bacchon ko shouch evam laghushanka ke liye khule maidan aadi kaa hi upyog karnaa hota hoga
 This is true to defy the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

 In the years ahead, presidents Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Collidge and Lyndon B
 Johnson all wrote about declaring this father's dedicated day as a national holiday

Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday strongly attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that his (prime Minister's) comment on Amit Shah is the biggest joke of the year 2011
 modi ne kaha, pradhanmantri ne apane samvaadadaata sammelan main gujarat ko jodne kii koshish kii taaki vah apane upar lage daag ko dho saken
 This is the joke of the year 2011
 yah haasyaaspad he
 In a conversation with television channel editors on Wednesday, referring to Shah indirectly, Singh had said, "opposition parties, especially the BJP, have taken a hostile stand and i cannot publicly state the reasons given
" 
 kyonki aapane kisi khaas vyakti ke khilaaf kuch faisla kiya he, jo gujarat main mantri tha to aap nishchit taur par apana faisla palaten
 i do not want to say anything else
 modi ne kaha, gujarat ke kisi mantri yaa rajya sarkaar kaa naam liye bagaiyr pradhanmantri ko bharat kii janata ko apni vifaltaaon ke bare main sahi tathy rakhana chahie
 Singh made this comment while blaming the opposition for the delay in introducing the Constitution Amendment Bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 modi sarkaar main purv mantri shah ko soharabuddin shaikh farji muthbhed maamle main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or ab vah jamaanat par reeha hai
 Criticizing Singh for blaming the BJP for delaying economic reforms, Modi said, "now that the Prime Minister has accepted his helplessness in running the government, then he has failed his government on economic reforms and Goods and Services Tax (GST)" True facts should be kept about
 bhaajapa or gujarat sarkaar ne aarthik sudhaaron tathaa jiesti ke prati hameshaa sakaaratmak rukh darshaya he
 Modi demanded that the central government make public the details of the meetings of the Empowered Committee during the last two years to implement GST
 unhone kaha ki yah spasht hoga ki baithkon main sirf vyavastha main sudhaar par charchaa hui he or kuch bhi thos nahin hua he
 Modi said about the meeting on GST with the Finance Minister a year ago that he had told Pranab Mukherjee that GST cannot be implemented until an information technology network is set up across the country
 unhone kaha, baithak main mukherjee ne khud apane karmchaariyon ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve samooche desh main soochna praudyogiki network ko lagu karne ke liye kaarybal kaa gathan karen
 However, even after one year no progress has been made on this issue
 modi ne kaha ki na sirf gaiyr congressi sarkaron balki jo partiyaan samprag kaa samarthan kar rahi hai unhone bhi centre ko spasht kar diya he ki vah jiesti ke mudde par rajyon ke hiton ke saath khilwaad na kare

 If anyone has ever been in possession of the three most powerful bases in Delhi's power corridor, it is Arun Jaitley
 modi sarkaar (modi Govt) main vah aise netaa hai, jinhen raisina hills sthit north or south block or udyog bhavanmen ek sathbaithne kaa mauka mila
 He has remained as a minister in the North Block and Udyog Bhavan even today, although he no longer has a defense ministry
 udyog bhawan se vahakaarporate afares ministry chalatehain
 If Jaitley gets an opportunity to work in North Block, South Block and Udyog Bhavan, then it is a reflection of his status in the Modi government - that is what he knows
 pichley saal jab kidney transplantesan ke chalate unhone vittamantri kaa kaamkaaj choda tha, tab piyush goyal ne unki jagah lee thi
 When two and a half months passed, the question started bouncing in the corridors of power - Who is the Finance Minister of the country, Jaitley or Piyush Goyal? This question was also raised by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy himself
 atakalein lagane lageen thim ki arthvyavastha ke mudde par vipaksh or andarkhaanehamale jhel rahe pradhanmantrimodi isi bahaane unki vittamantri padase vidaai kar koi doosraa mantralay de saktehain, magartin maheene baad dobaaraa vittamantri kii kursi par vaapasi kar jetali ne na keval aalochakon kaa muh band kar diya, balki modi sarkaar main apni pakad majboot hone kaa phir subut de diya
 It was not surprising for those who knew Arun Jaitley and Modi's relationship closely
 vah jaanate the ki arun jetali ko unki ichha ke viparatimodi kabhi nahin chhedanachahenge
 One of the main reason behind all this is Arun Jaitley's PM Modi's 'being trustworthy'
 modi ke dilli aane se pehle se unke najdiki sambandh rahe hai
 Dostana is two decades old
 najdiki kii vajah kaa link gujarat ke godhra se bhi judaa he
 It is Jaitley's influence in the government that Arun Shourie, who was a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government, has said many times in the past that only a trio of Modi, Shah and Jaitley is running the country and the BJP
 vaajapeyi kii tulana main vartmaan modi cabinet main pratibhashali mantriyon kii kami ke aarope lagate hai
 Critics say that there are only a few ministers, including Arun Jaitley, in whom all manner of tact is seen, not just political
 jo tu da point bahes main bhaag lete hai or troling kii jagah tarkon kii dhaal banaakar maidan main utarate hai
 Arun Jaitley is one of the most talented ministers in the current Modi cabinet
 isamen badi bhoomika supreme court main lambii vakaalat bhi he
 When political debate takes place, they make proper use of their art of advocacy in it
 angreji par jitani pakad he, utani hi hindi par
 Are good communicators
 bahes har str par or har dhang se kar sakate hai
 While talking, sometimes they become soft, sometimes they look aggressive, then they do not even suffer from personal attack
 jaise buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan dikhaa
 When he told Congress President Rahul Gandhi during the debate on Rafale - he needs to start his knowledge from ABCD
 2002 main jab godhra danga hua to bijepi ke sheersh netaaon main agar koi tatkaaleen siemanarendra modi ke samarthan main khada hua to vah arun jetali hi the
 When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was thinking of taking action against Modi, Jaitley requested Advani to stop doing so
 jetali kii lobing par kai netaa modi ke peeche khadey najar aae
 Though Modi was already known to Jaitley, but this incident brought Modi closer to Jaitley
 2005 main soharabuddin shaikh kaa bahucharchit encounter hua
 In this, the then Home Minister of Gujarat Amit Shah got trapped
 godhra main modi or kathith phek encounter main fanse amit shah ko dephend karne main arun jetali hameshaa maano 'ek paanv' par khadey rahe
 If you turn the pages of newspapers from 2002 to 2013, Arun Jaitley will get all the statements related to defending Modi and Shah in the case of Godhra, Sohrabuddin Sheikh, Ishrat Jahan, Haren Pandya etc
 itnaa bijepi ke anya kisi sheersh netaa ne modi ke paksh main bayaanbaji nahin kii thi
 Not only the rhetoric Jaitley also provided legal help in the case
 har kshetra main apane samparkon kaa bhi bakhubi istemaal bhi kiya
 On 27 September 2013, Arun Jaitley wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 is patr ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aaj bhi apni website par sambhalakar rakhaa he
 (click to read the letter) In this letter, Arun Jaitley accused the UPA government of misusing investigative agencies to implicate the then CM of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah
 apane patr main arun jetali ne haren pandya se lekar soharabuddin, ishrat jahaan, soharabuddin aadi encounter cese ke jariye bijepi ke sambandhit netaaon ko fansaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Even though Rajnath Singh is the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha
 aadhikarik taur par rajnath singh ko sarkaar main number do kaha jaataa he
 But Arun Jaitley is considered the most influential in the Modi government as the Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ke kai netaa yah sweekaar karne se hichak nahin karte ki narendra modi agar amit shah ke baad kisi ko sabase zyada kareebi or bharosemand maanate hai, to vah arun jetali hai
 This is the reason why Arun Jaitley's direct role is seen in most of the decisions of the government
 is bharose ke peeche arun jetali kaa modi-shah ko sankat ke samay saath dena he
 Experts also say that when Narendra Modi came to power in May 2014, he was an 'outsider' for Delhi
 lagaataar teen baar chif ministar rahete bhale hi unhen satta ke rang-dhang malum the, magar yah bhalee-bhaanti jaanate the ki dilli gandhinagar nahin hai
 The gait here is somewhat different
 narendra modi ko apni cabinet main ek aise shaks kii talash thi, jo dilli or lutiyans jone kii rag-rag se waakif ho
 His search was sustained by Arun Jaitley
 yahi vajah he ki amritsar se 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav haar jane ke baad bhi unhen vittamantri banaaya gaya
 Became the Ministry of Defense and Corporate Affairs
 ve modi cabinet ke aise mantri rahe, jinhen ek saath north block( vittamantralay) or south block( rakshaamantralay) main baithne kaa mauka mila
 This is a proof of Modi's trust in him
 bihar main har varsh dalit samudaay dwaara mokama main chauharmal jayanti dhoomdhaam se manaai jaati he
 But on Saturday, when Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi arrived to attend the ceremony, they were greeted with black flags
 samaaroh main badi sankhya main dalit samudaay ke log jamaa the
 As soon as Paswan and Modi arrived they started showing black flags
 aayojakon kii tamaam apilon ke baavjood ve shant nahin hue
 Ramvilas Paswan then took the mic and said that as long as he is alive no one can point fingers at the reservation
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek mulaakaat main kaha he ki aarakshan hamaari laash par khatm hoga
 After this Paswan assured the people that the case related to the Dalit Act would be heard soon after the appeal of the central government
 susheel modi jab bhaashan ke liye khadey hue tab unhone kareeb do minute tak 'guunje dharti aasmaan, ramvilas paswan' ke naare lagaae
 But he soon finished his speech, sensing the anger of the crowd
 haalanki ramvilas paswan ne logon se susheel modi ko sunne kii apil kii
 The attitude of Dalits in this ceremony shows that at present, they are not ready to accept many issues with just assurance
 haalanki ravivaar ko isi jagah par is kaarykram main bhaag lene ke kiye vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi bhi ja rahe hai
 a large number of people from the Dalit community gathered in the ceremony
 jaise hi paswan or modi pahunche unhone kaale jhande dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 Despite all the appeals of the organizers, he did not calm down
 tab ramvilas paswan ne mike liya or kaha ki jab tak ve jinda hai koi aarakshan par anguli nahin uthaa saktaa
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in a meeting that reservation will end on our corpse
 iske baad paswan ne logon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki dalit act se sambandhit maamle main centre sarkaar kii apil ke baad jald sunwaayee hogi
 When Sushil Modi stood for the speech, he shouted slogans of 'echoing earth skies, Ram Vilas Paswan' for about two minutes
 lekin unhone apana bhaashan bheed kaa gussa bhaanpate hue jald khatm kar diya
 However, Ram Vilas Paswan appealed to the people to listen to Sushil Modi
 is samaaroh main daliton ke rukh se lagata he ki philhal kai muddon par keval aashwaasan se ve maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 However, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi are also going to attend this event on Sunday at the same place

 On Friday, when the news of raids on all the places of Lalu Yadav was reported, the question was whether the alliance between Nitish and Lalu has reached the verge of ending
 sawaal isliye bhi uthanaa swabhaavik tha kyonki sibiai kii exiaar ke lapete main tejasvi yadav bhi aae hai, jo nitish kii sarkaar main mantri hai
 Will Nitishtejsviko, who cares about the image of good governance Babu, get him out of the cabinet
 is sawaal kaa jawaab har koi jaananaa chaah rahaa tha lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab jinke paas tha wo na to kisi se baat kar rahe the or na hi media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye uplbdh the
 It may be a coincidence that on Friday morning, when raids on Laloo Yadav's whereabouts were done, Nitish Kumar was not in Patna but in Rajgir
 wo darasal guuruuvaar ko hi rajgir chale gaye the
 Officially it is being said that Nitish Kumar was not well and he has gone to Rajgir to rest
 lekin atakalon kaa bazaar garm he
 Some people say that Nitish Kumar had already been informed about the raid on Lalu's hideouts
 taaki unhen vishwaas main bhi liya ja sake or chhaapon ke baad agar kanoon vyavastha bigadati he to uske liye rajya sarkaar taiyaar rahe
 Some people also say that Nitish left Patna because of opposition from the presidential candidate Meira Kumar
 mira kumaar guuruuvaar ko patna main vidhayakon se milakar samarthan maangane gai thim
 According to sources, Meera also wanted to meet Kumar Kumar
 nitish pehle hi ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki unki party endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan denge
 JDU is also making silence against Lalu its weapon
 ye baat dilli main bhi saaf dikhi
 Sharad Yadav and KC Tyagi, who kept the party's side in the media in everything, were both in Delhi
 lekin patrakaron kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood ye netaa lalu ke sawaal par munh kholane ko taiyaar nahin the
 On getting a lot of guts, it was also known that he has been asked to keep quiet on this matter from the party high command
 yani musiibat main ghire lalu ko jediu ne akele chhod diya he
 According to sources, the JDU is silent as to whether speaking up would mean either taking the side of Laloo Yadav or blaming the BJP and the central government for this, alleging that the central government was misusing the CBI
 jediu na to is vakt lalu ke ghotaalon ke daldal main khud ko fansaana chaahati he or na hi lalu ke liye bijepi se sambandh kharaab karnaa chaahati he
 Nitish Kumar is using this occasion to pressure Lalu and his sons
 nitish ko lagaataa he ki gathbandhan kii sarkaar main apni sthiti majboot karne kaa ye shandaar mauka he
 For this it is necessary that there is absolutely no interruption between Lalu and CBI
 kaha ja rahaa he ki chaape or mukademen ke baad bhi nitish lalu ke beton ke mantrimandal se nikaalane main jaldbaaji nahin karenge
 They are sitting in Rajgir and watching the wind move
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki lalu or unke bete agar ghotaale main or buree tarah funsate hai to argedy or congress donon main foot ho sakati he
 In Patna, it is very much discussed that the meeting of Congress and RJD mlas was called on Thursday to meet Meera Kumar, in which seven Congress mlas and two dozen RJD mlas were absent

 When we start a relationship with someone, we move forward thinking that we have to maintain this relationship for a lifetime
 jindagibhar saath dena he lekin kai baar kuch aisa hota he jisase kuch samay baad hi us rishte main khatas aa jaati he
 There is nothing left in the relationship because of which you think to pursue that relationship
 phir ek mode par aakar aap alag hone kaa sochane lag jaati hai
 If something similar has happened to you and you are thinking of ending your relationship, then there will be a big reason behind it
 ye baat mukhya rup se mahilaon par lagu hoti he kyonki wo kisi bhi relation ko todane ke liye nahin jodatiin
 Once she connects with someone, she tries to keep it till the end
 par agar koi aurat pahal karke rishta khatm kar rahi he to ho na ho uske peeche koi gambhir vajah hogi hi

 agar aap bhi kisi ke saath apane sambandhon ko ek paaydaan aage le janaa chaah rahi hai to sabase pehle gambhirtha se uske bare main sochie
 Think, whether the boy you are going to make your partner will be able to support you throughout your life

 kya aapkaa bwoyfriend aapse baaten chhipaata he? kya wo choti-choti baton ko lekar aapse jhooth bolta he? agar aisa he to behatar hoga ki aap usase abhi alag ho jaaie
 2
 kya wo hameshaa fijical hone kii baat hi karata he? agar haa to ye jaan lijie ki ye last he lav nahin
 3
 kya jab aap use apane kisi purush mitra ke bare main bataati hai to uskaa mood kharaab ho jaataa he? agar haa to ye jaan lijie ki aap donon relationships main to hai lekin aapke relation main na to bharosa he or na hi samaj
 4
 kya uske liye apni bhavanaaen, apana parivaar, apana kaam hi sabakuch he? kya voapke prati utana samvedansheel nahin hajitna wo khud ke liye he?5

 NIA officer Tanjil Ahmed's death is being investigated by the investigating agencies as a result of personal rivalry, which could be due to a love triangle or a property dispute
 lekin unka parivaar kahata he ki unhen aatankwaadiyon ne maaraa he
 Tanjeel Ahmed was shot dead in a village in Bijnor last Saturday night
 police is silsile main kareeb aadha darjan logon ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kar rahi he
 The big question is what was the personal rivalry in which the murderer hated him so much that he shot him 24
 police ko is qatl main tanzeel ke gaanv sahaspur ke hi teen logon zainul, reyaan or munir par shaq he
 All three were involved in that daily wedding
 police ke mutabik teenon tanzeel se nafrat karte the kyonki reyaan tanzeel ke rishtedaar hai jinke parivaar main sampatti ke bantwaare main tanzeel ne reyaan ke pita kaa virodh kiya tha
 Zainul is also angry with Tanjil for his behavior and has some property dispute with Munir
 teenon vahaan se do bike se nikle
 Zainul took off from Ryan's bike, while Munir gave his helmet and bike to Ryan
 munir munh pe kapadaa baandh kar khud reyaan ke saath peeche baitha
 He roasted Tanjil with bullets
 tippaniyan The NIA, ATS, STF and the biggest police officers are investigating the case
 inase poochtacha main bhi yah log shaamil hai
 Investigation agencies suspect that the reason for this may not be the love triangle
 aisa bhi shaq zaahir kiya gaya he ki tanzeel or munir ek hi ladki se prem karte the
 But in respect of the dignity of an NIA officer, the investigating agencies consider it appropriate to remain silent on this issue
 lekin tanzeel ke bhai raagaib kaa kahana he ki tanzeel kii hatya aatankwaadiyon ne kii he
 a team of top ATS officers is engaged in investigating the aspect of terrorism in Tanjil's death

 The police suspect Zainul, Rayan and Munir, three people from the village of Sahaspur in Tanjil
 teenon us rose shaadi main shaamil the
 According to the police, the trio hated Tanjil as Rayan is a relative of Tanjil whose assets in his family were opposed by Tanjil's father
 zainul bhi tanzeel ke bartaav se unase naaraaz rahata tha or munir ke saath unka kuch sampatti vivaad he
 The trio left two bikes from there

 Munir tied himself on his face and sat back with Ryan

 These people are also involved in questioning them
 jaanch agenciyon ko shaq he ki kahin isaki vajah prem trikon na ho
 It is also suspected that Tanjil and Munir were in love with the same girl
 lekin ek enie afasar kii garima ke lihaaz main jaanch agenciyaan is mudde par khamosh rahanaa hi munasib samajhati hai
 But Tanjil's brother Ragib says that Tanjil is murdered by the terrorists

 But the investigating agencies argue that if it was the work of terrorists, they would have killed in Delhi
 dilli main ek enie afasar ko maarane se kai guna zyaada aatank failata
 If the terrorists were there, they would have killed the whole family sitting in the car, not just by choosing Tanjil
 phir aatankwaadi ek baje raat main kisi gaanv main hamalaa nahin karte
 Not only this, all the big officials are doing the investigation related to terrorism, in such a situation, how would any terrorist be benefited by killing Tanjil? However, until the police reach Munir, accused of killing Tanjil, the reason for his murder will remain secret

 In the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, the government managed to save its credibility on the amendment proposals brought on the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC)
 ensitisi par hue matvibhaajan main trinmul congress, samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne sarkaar kaa saath diya jisase vipaksh kaa sanshodhan prastaav gir gaya
 In his response to the discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the President's address, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh assured the House that the government will discuss the issue with the Chief Ministers, while forming a consensus on the formation of NCTC
 pradhanmantri kii ore se aashwaasan milane ke baad sapa or basapa ne matvibhaajan ke samay sarkaar kaa saath diya
 Six Trinamool mps were not present in the House during the vote
 sanshodhan prastaav, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) sahit anya vipakshi dalon ne pesh kiya tha
 The Prime Minister said, "nothing will be done that would violate the federal structure of the Constitution
" 'singh ne thik yahi baat somvaar ko loksabhaa main bhi kahi thi
 Referring to the proposed Chief Ministers meeting on 16 April, the Prime Minister said, 'I understand that the idea of NCTC and its way of working are two separate issues
 ensitisi kii kaarypaddati ko lekar matbhed ho sakate hai
 But i am confident that differences can be resolved through dialogue and consultation
 'pradhanmantri ne sadan ko yah bhi suchit kiya ki mukhyamantriyon kii ek baithak 16 april ko hone vaali he, or us dauraan ensitisi par unke vichaaron par raishumaari kii jaaegi
 Notwithstanding assurances by the Government of the Deputy Chairman not to withdraw the amendment by the opposition parties
 rahamaan khan ne matvibhaajan kaa nirdesh diya
 The government was passing through some worrying moments when Khan announced that there were 82 votes in favor of NCTC amendment and 105 in opposition
 sanshodhan prastaav girane ke baad bhaajapa, vamadal or biju janata dal ke saansad sarkaar ke rukh ke virodh main sadan se baahar chale gaye
 On supporting the government, SP leader Mohan Singh said that his party does not want to see communal parties growing
 singh ne patrakaron se kaha, 'desh prayek saal aam chunaavon kaa saamana karne kii sthiti main nahin he or desh main sampradayik takaton kaa kabja ho jaae, isaki ham anumati nahin de sakate
 He said that his party reluctantly supported the government
 vahiin, vipaksh kaa sanshodhan prastaav girane par bhaajapa netaa venkaiya naidu ne ise sanghavaad kii haar bataaya
 He said, 'federalism is being attacked again and again
 ham puri tarah niraash hai
 Earlier, bjp's Arun Jaitley, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, demanded trust from the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri is baat kaa bharosa den ki ensitisi ke tahat kaam karne vaale kendriya bal rajyon kii jaankaree athwa unki anumati ke bagaiyr rajya main pravesh nahin karenge
 At the same time, senior leader of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) Sitaram Yechury said that the Prime Minister should promise that the government will proceed on the NCTC issue only after negotiating with the Chief Ministers
 vipaksh kii ashankaon kaa jawaab dete hue sansadeey kaary mantri pi

 'umang main bharaa hua main, yah bhi nahin poochta,aglaa padaavakitani dur he ?hai bhi, yaa nahin hai ? These days, the picture of henna Hasan, an eight-year-old child living in Bangladesh, is in the news in the Asian media
 is maasoom kii kahani jaanakar aap maayoos ho jaaenge
 Henna Hassan is suffering from such a disease, due to which his body is gradually becoming a stone
 sabase dukhad baat yah he ki menhadi ko dekhte hi log vahaan se bhaag khadey hote hai
 Some children even call him a ghost
 in halaaton ke chalate menhadi ke parivaar vaale use ghar main hi rakhte hai
 Doctors say that henna hasan is a rare skin disease
 is beemaari se peedit logon kaa sharir dhire-dheer pathar ke samaan kathor hota jaataa he
 At present, henna has become such a condition that it is not able to walk
 use khadaa hone tak main dikkat hoti he
 The comments menhadi apane parivaar ke saath bangladesh ke dona rananagar ilaake main rahata he
 Henna's father, who works as a driver, is not able to get proper treatment even if he wants to
 maa jahanara begum hi menhadi kii dekhbhaal karti hai
 Emotionally, the mother Jahanra says, 'my son cannot even wear clothes
 uski padhai-likhaai tak chhot gai he
 He told that Henna Hassan had no disease at birth
 jab vah 12 din kaa tha to uske sharir par ek dana dikhaa tha
 He ignored it
 dekhte hi dekhte yah beemaari puure sharir ko apni chapet main le chukaa he
 She says that due to lack of money, she has not been able to treat her son well so far
 agar koi unki madad kare to ve jivan par uske shukraguzaar rahenge
 Henna lives with his family in Dona Rananagar area of bangladesh
 driver kii naukari karne vaale menhadi ke pita chaahakar bhi uskaa uchit upachaar nahin karvaa paa rahe hai
 Mother Jahanra Begum looks after henna
 bhavuk hote hue maa jahanara kahati he, 'meraa betaa kapade tak nahin pahan paata he
 He has missed even his studies
 ' unhone bataaya ki janm ke samay menhadi hasan ko koi beemaari nahin thi
 When he was 12 days old, a grain appeared on his body
 unhone ise nazarandaaj kar diya
 This disease has caught the whole body in its sight
 wo kahati hai ki paison kii kami ke chalate vah apane bete kaa ab tak achche se ilaaj nahin karvaa pai hai
 If someone helps them, they will be thankful to him for life

 apni sarkaar ke dher saare sankaton kaa saamana karne ke baavjood pakistan ke pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ne jald chunaav karaae jane kii kisi bhi sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya
 He said that the next general elections would be held in 2013 as per the scheduled time
 gilaani ne apane grih nagar multan main shuukravaar shaam samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki sarkaar aam chunaav karaane ke liye sanvaidhanik or uchit kanoonee prakriya kaa paalan karegi
 He said, 'those who have nothing, they desire to be something and they discuss elections
 lekin ve yah nahin jaanate ki ham kanoon or samvidhan ke anusaar karrwai karenge
 We are proceeding according to the consensus of the Parliament
 ’ When asked about the relationship between President Asif Ali Zardari and Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Gilani said, "their relations are very good
 ’ unhone un media khabaron ko khaarij kar diya, jisamen unhone sena pramukh se pichley saal teen saal kaa seva vistaar kaa anurodh sweekaar karne ko kaha tha
 He said that the English translation of his commentary in Urdu on this issue led to confusion
 ye aag, ye gussa, ye virodh, ye police
 And now this slap of khatun in khaki uniform
 patna kii city espi kim apane naam kim se kam ladi singhm ke naam se zyada mashhoor hai
 And perhaps nowadays she is living in the character of Lady Singham
 'ladi singhm' sabase pehle ek ladke ke sir par mukka maarthi hai
 The same hand in which the mobile is pressed
 paas main hi ladke kii maa khadi thi
 Mother does not tolerate beating of son
 lihaaja wo city espi se bas itnaa hi puuchhati he ki uske bete ko kyon maar rahi ho ki achaanak city espi apana aapa kho baithti hai
 She then slaps her mother in front of the son
 maa ko is thappad se itnaa gussa aata he ki wo bhul jaati he ki thappad espi city ne maaraa he
 Then what was there
 gusse main wo bhi espi city kim par haath uthaa detii he
 The mother's hand was to raise that SP City's anger reaches the seventh sky
 ab donon lagbhag ek-duusare kaa bal pakad kar aise ladane lagati hai maanon ye police public kii ladaai nahin balki do auraton yaa saas-bahu kaa jhagada ho
 Meanwhile, the son could not stand even seeing the mother slapping in front of him
 saath main bahut se police vaale bhi vahaan khadey the
 They were also shaken by this act of both
 baad main kisi tarah pulisavaalon ne espi city or or us mahila ko alag kiya
 After this, the mother and son were taken away from the spot
 aaie ab aapako puri kahani bataate hai
 In fact, two boys died due to electrocution in Kankarbagh area of patna on Monday evening
 donon ladakon par hitansion taar tut kar gir padaa tha
 After this, the people of the area became angry with the administration's negligence
 unhone todphod or aagjanee shuru kar di
 Later, the police, who reached the spot, tried hard to convince them
 bheed ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye laathiyaan bhi bhanji
 And then the City SP also reached there
 maamla laaparvaahee se maut kaa tha
 People were angry
 par gusse main hinsa ko jaays nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 It was also the fault of the people
 par aise halaat se nipatane ke liye hameshaa police ko sanyam baratane kii salaah or training di jaati he
 But perhaps City SP Sahiba had forgotten these lessons in anger
 kya yun kisi ko saream thappad maarna sahi he? kya kisi buzurg mahila par haath uthaanaa jaays he?jis mahila or uske bete par espi city kim ne haath uthaaya wo donon khud ko naa sirf apamaanit mahus kar rahe hai balki espi city kii is harakat ke liye patna police ko adaalat main ghaseetne kaa man bana chuke hai
 The family whose city SP Kim had beaten on Monday night in Kankarbagh area of patna is going to file a case against the SP and the police
 peedit mahila sujatha ke mutabik unke mohalle main do ladako kii maut hui thi or unka parivaar sirf get ke paas khadaa hokar hangaame ko dekh rahaa tha
 Then angry policemen entered their campus and started assaulting and mistreating them
 duusari taraf sujatha ke bete animesh kaa kahana he ki espi city kim chunki patna main ladi singhm ke naam se mashhoor ho rahi thim lihaaja wo unhen super cop samajhane laga tha
 According to Animesh, he deeply respected SP City
 uskaa kahana he ki somvaar raat hangaame ke baad espi ko samajhane ke liye hi wo unke kareeb gaya tha
 But on the contrary, they beat him up
 is haadase ke baad espi ko lekar animesh kaa nazariyaa ab badal gaya he
 However, in this entire case, the police themselves have not written any complaint against Sujatha or her son
 yahaan tak ki espi city ne bhi khud par hamale yaa marpet kii baat se inkaar kiya he

 For the past four years, the army of shah-modi has been campaigning to build a Congress-free India as if the Congress and the Congress at any time will awaken like a dragon and swallow the bjp's massive electoral army in a blink of an eye
 hakikathan, 2014 ke baad bhaajapa ne khud hi congress ke pratinaayakatv ko mahimamandit kiya, nahin to voter is bujurg party ko kabhi kaa 10, janpath main samet chuke the
 The Congress, dwarfed in both leader and strategy, is not a hindrance to the bjp's electoral and political goals, but a convenience
 yah congress hi to he jo adhyakshiya taur-tareeke vaale do daleey kaalpanik bhaajapai loktantr main ek fantasy dushman kii bhoomika nibhaa sakati he
 The threat to the BJP is from the numerous regional forces and identities, which were being tried to contain it in the grip of the Congress
 yahi pintara ab numaayan ho chalaa he
 The study of hostilities is a favorite pastime of individual and collective classical psychology
 kisi bam yaa bandook ko banane se pehle usase marane vaale shatru kii sankalpana kerani hoti he
 This concept is also part of motivational psychology nowadays
 yani ek aisi takat kii kalpana jo hameshaa hamaare khilaaf sajeesh main lagi he or jise lagaataar dhul chataate rahanaa safalataa ke liye jaruri he
 After the BJP came to power, it created two imaginary enemies - one was the Left which had already reached its position to find and the other was Congress-free India
 vaise, bharat ko congress se mukt karne kaa bidaa uthaane kii koi jarurat nahin thi kyonki yah kaam kaaphi had tak congress ne khud hi kar liya tha
 Since the 2004 general election, by 2014, the Congress has lost nearly 60 elections (congress-mukt Bharat won at a faster pace after 2009) and 29 elections
 2009 kii loksabhaa jeet or 2014 kii bhavy haar inke alaava he
 There are several big states (uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha) in the figures of defeat, where the new generation will have to ask Google when was the last time Congress ruled there
 2014 ke baad bhaajapa ko jo congress mili thi, vah to thik se vipaksh hone ke boj se bhi mukt ho chuki thi
 The fear of enemies is part of the motivational psychology of the forces, even if the battle is electoral
 alabatta congress ko uski haisiyat se bada pratidwandvi banane main bhaajapa kaa sirf yahi makasad nahin tha ki uski sena hameshaa congress ke khilaaf yuddh ke dhol-damaame bajaati rahe balki isse kahin zyada bada makasad un kshetreey dalon ko daraana yaa simtaana he jo uske vaastavik shatru hai or jin par sidhaa akraman bhavishya kii jaruraton (gathbandhan) ke hisaab se mufeed nahin he
 This contest of All India BJP vs Regional Parties is not as good as All India Congress vs Regional Party
 bhaajapa jis ekarangi rajnatik rashtrawaad kii 'sadhana' main lagi he, usamen sabase bade vighnakarta kshetreey dal hai jo up rashtravaadi pahachaanon kii siyasat par jinda hai
 The same parties are the thorns in the bjp's cultural religious nationalism, which makes every election Hindu versus Hindu by brightening ethnic identities
 dhyaan rahe ki bhaajapa ko karnataka main congress ne nahin, janata dal (es) ne roka
 Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Mamta Banerjee in Bengal, Naveen Patnaik in Odisha stood in his way
 karnataka main pity congress ko ab 2009 kii congress banane se pehle 1995-96 kii bhaajapa bananaa hoga
 When the BJP was embracing the formula of non-congressism in the shadow of regional identities
 kshetreey dalon ke kshatrapon ko sadak kii dhoop or dhul se milanaa hoga kyonki congress mukt bharat muhim kaa nishaanaa rahul gandhi nahin balki un sabhi kshetreey dalon kaa astitv he jinke netaa kumaraswami ke sir par taj rakhane ke liye bangaluru aae the

 It is not easy to imagine how Felix must have reconciled at such a high altitude, so much cold, and at a speed much faster than a falling sound
 
 
 baharhaal, 43-varshiya austrian naagarik felics bomgartner ne mexico main is karname ko safaltaapurvak anjaam dekar dhwani kii gati se tej girane kaa record to tod daalaa, haalanki vah sabase lambe ke freefal (bina parachute kii madad ke girte rahane) kaa icchit record nahin bana paae
 
 
 Felix Baumgartner's campaign spokesperson, Sarah Anderson, has reported that Felix has a total of 1,28,097 feet (39)
 044 kilometre) kii oonchai se koode, or parachute kholane se pehle chaar minute, 19 second tak sidhe girte rahe
 
 
 The most important aspect of this jump was that within 30 seconds of starting the fall, his speed had reached 1,137 kilometers per hour
 
 
 pravaktaa anderson ke mutabik chalaang lagane or new mexico marusthal main utarane ke bich felics bomgartner kii chalaang kul milakar nau minute or teen second tak jari rahi, jisamen parachute kholane ke baad ke chaar minute or 44 second bhi shaamil hai
 
 
 Indeed, Felix Baumgartner wanted to freefall for more than five minutes before opening the parachute, and according to the initial plan he expected to leap from a height of less than 1,20,000 feet
 
 
 20 april, 1969 ko austria ke salzaburg main janme felics bomgartner asal main 50 saal pehle america airforce ke ritred karnal joseph kittinger dwaara banaae gaye record ko todane kii koshish kar rahe the
 
 
 Kittinger recorded 31,333 m (1,02,798) in the year 1960
 56 foot) kii oonchai se freefal kiya tha
 
 
 Notably, the same Joseph Kittinger was in Felix Baumgartner's backup team this time
 
 
 oonchi imaaraton se chalaang lagane ke liye mashhoor austrian jaanbaaj felics bomgartner kaaphi lambe arase se is chalaang kii taiyaariyaan kar rahe the
 
 
 According to the initial plan, he was supposed to jump to a height of about 36 and a half kilometers in the sky with the help of a balloon last Tuesday (october 9), but he was unable to do so due to the inverted wind in Rosswell, New Mexico

 The comments jahaan se felics ne chalaang lagaai, vahaan pahunchane main bhi unhen kareeb do ghante lage the
 
 
 The height from which Baumgartner has jumped, there is no air, and there is always a state of vacuum, in which breathing is the biggest challenge
 
 
 felics bomgartner ne is chalaang ke liye khaas kism kaa pressure suut pahana tha, jo bilkul vaisaa tha, jaisaa antariksh yatriyon ko pahanaaya jaataa he
 
 
 Significantly, among those who had tried to jump from such a height earlier, only Joseph Kittinger was successful, who in August 1960, 31 with the help of balloons
 3 kilometre kii oonchai se chalaang lagaai thi
 
 
 All the remaining attempters were killed during the campaign itself

 However, Felix Baumgartner, a 43-year-old Austrian citizen, successfully broke the record for speeding at a speed of sound in Mexico by successfully executing the feat, although he did not set the record for the longest freefall (falling without the help of a parachute)

 This time in Bihar elections, the old party of RJD Janata Parivar is challenging the NDA along with JDU and Congress
 aaie daalate hai argedy ke siyaasi safar ke ahm padaavon par ek najar
 1
 lalu yadav ne argedy ke rup main apni alag party1997 main tab khadi kar lee jab janata dal main unke liye mushkil vakt chal rahaa tha
 After being surrounded by allegations in the fodder scam, it became difficult for Lalu Yadav to continue as the Janata Dal president
 sharad yadav ko janata dal kaa adhyaksh pad mila
 After this, on 5 July 1997 Lalu Prasad broke away from the Janata Dal with his trusted leaders and from here the foundation of the RJD
 2
 Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, 17 mps of Lok Sabha including Kanti Singh and 8 mps of Rajya Sabha joined Lalu Prasad's party
 lalu prasad yadav ke samarthak nai dilli main jamaa hue or rashtriya janata dal banaakar lalu yadav ko iskaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 This party was allotted the election symbol and Lalu Yadav claimed that Yelatlane would bring light to the poor's hut and raise the slogan of socialism
 3
 In the early 1999 Lalu Yadav had to go to jail in the fodder scam and the government command in Bihar was handed over to his wife Rabri Devi
 march 1998 main hue aam chunaavon main argedy ko bihar main loksabhaa kii 17 siton par jeet hasil huin
 After this, RJD formed an alliance with Mulayam Singh Yadav's party against the BJP, but even this effort could not show any significant effect

 haalanki, 2005 main jab bihar vidhansabha ke chunaav hue to sameekaran kaaphi badal gaye
 The BJP formed the NDA alliance and projected Nitish Kumar as the face of the NDA in Bihar
 lalu yadav kii party ko 75 siten hin hasil ho pai
 However, neither party could form the government
 usee saal phir chunaav hue or argedy 21 siton par simatakar aa gai
 The NDA coalition got a majority and Nitish Kumar became the chief minister
 7
 RJD gained national party status in 2008, with a presence in the states of Jharkhand and Northeast, besides Bihar
 8
 In the 2009 general elections, there was no seat sharing with the Congress and the RJD came out of the UPA
 ramvilas paswan or samaajawaadee party ke saath gathjod hua
 rjd's performance in this election was very poor

 The party broke the alliance with the Samajwadi Party in the 2010 assembly elections
 30 july 2010 ko rashtriya janata dal kii rashtriya party ke darja ko waapas le liya gaya

 2014 ke aam chunaavon main argedy phir upie ke saath milakar ladi
 However, the UPA alliance failed to stop the storm of the BJP led by Narendra Modi
 lalu yadav supreme court ke aadesh ke kaaran chunaavon main nahin utar sake
 His wife Rabri Devi and daughter Misa Bharti lost the election
 endie gathbandhan ne aitihaasik jeet hasil kii
 While the Congress party was reduced to only 44 seats, only 4 RJD mps could reach the Lok Sabha
 10
 The defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and the rise of the BJP united the Janata Dal family parties and on 14 April 2015, the RJD, JDU, JD-S, Samajwadi Party, Indian National Lok Dal and Samajwadi Janata Party announced that all parties would merge The family will be reunited
 kai daur kii baatcheet hui or mulaayam singh yadav ko prastaavit nai party kaa mukhiya bhi ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Lalu Prasad Yadav also announced the merger of RJD after holding a press conference
 lekin bihar chunaav najadik aate hijantha parivaar ke vilay kaa sapana bhi khatai mempad gaya
 After this attempt of solidarity failed, it was again claimed that all parties would jointly contest the elections
 lekin argedy-jediu or congress dwaara kam siten ghoshit kiye jane ke baad mulaayam singh kismajawaadee party isse alag ho gai
 The dream of reuniting the Janata Parivar was also lost again in political ambitions
 bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main lalu yadav kii argedy 101 siton par chunaav main utari he jabaki jediu 101 or congress 41 siton par

 After the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh, all eyes were on whether or not 2014 will be repeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 nattejey aae to pichhali baar ke mukaable party ko sirf 9 siton kaa nuksaan hua
 BJP got 62 seats out of total 80 while its ally Apna Dal managed to save both its seats
 bada sawaal ye he ki agar gathbandhan main congress shaamil ho jaati to nattejey badal jate
 The answer is no
 congress to kaayade se vot kaatane main bhi kaamyaab nahin ho pai
 There were only 8 such seats where the sum of votes received by the Congress and the Grand Alliance was more than the NDA
 is aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki agar sab saath milte to bhi endie ko kam se kam 56 siten milteen
 Although this is a virtual situation
 sapa–basapa gathbandhan ko mili vot saaf darshaate hai ki sirf ek saath ladane se hi ek duusare ko vot transfar nahin hote, kyonki kehete hai naa ki raajnneeti main kabhi 2 or 2 kaa jod 4 nahin hota
 a seat-by-seat analysis of the 2019 results shows that the vote share of both parties has been reduced in 51 out of 78 seats as compared to 2014
 2014 main donon partiyaan alag-alag ladiin thim
 In 15 seats, the votes of SP and BSP decreased by 10 percent
 yani donon partiyon ke votaron ke bich ‘talmail’ kii baari kami thi
 Looking at the 2014 data, the alliance of BSP and Samajwadi Party votes was ahead in 41 seats
 yani agar 2014 main donon saath lade hote to bijepi 71 kii bajaae sirf 37 siton par simat kar rah jaati
 Mayawati and Akhilesh joined hands to make this math the basis, but it could not happen in 2019
 duusari taraf endie ne 80 main se 74 siton par apana vot share badhaayaa, 6 main 5 aisi siten thim jahaan unka vot pratishat kareeb 3 fisadi tak gira, sirf mujjafanagar kii seat par unka vot share kareeb 9 fisadi gira iske baavjood areldi ke netaa ajit singh chunaav jeet na sake or bijepi se ye seat chin nahin paae
 Should it be assumed that caste and social fabric did not play any role in UP, then there is no answer to this
 ajtak-exis maai india kaa chunaav baad surveykshan kahata he ki donon partiyon ne apana kor voter bachaakar rakhaa
 More than 70 percent of Muslims, Jatav Dalits and Yadavs voted in favor of the grand alliance
 vahiin 70 fisadi se zyada savarnon, gaiyr yadav pichhadi jatiyon, kareeb 57 fisadi gaiyr jatav daliton or 55 fisadi jaaton ne bhaajapa ko vot diya
 It can be broadly said that all the remaining castes voted in favor of BJP
 aakhir ye hua kaiseupi kii kul jansankhya main muslim, yadav or daliton aabaadi kii bhagidaari kareeb 49 fisadi he
 If we remove the non-jatav Dalits from this, then the core voters of the grand alliance remain 39 percent because the non-jatav population is about 10 percent
 ek khaas baat ye bhi he ki mahagathbandhan ke 39 fisadi vot rajya bhar main bikhare hue hai
 Pradeep Gupta, chairman and managing director of Axis My India, says that if you do a seat-by-seat analysis, you will find that there are different numbers of people from the same community in every district across the state
 maai exis ke numberon ke mutabik gathbandhan kaa jaateey ganit unke hisaab se feet nahin baitha
 Only 20 of the 80 seats formed the alliance of the alliance, while the BJP benefited in the remaining seats
 upi kaa jaateey ganit fail nahin hua, balki yah bhaajapa ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 However, it can be clearly said that the BJP pulled the dice of non-jatav votes
 exis maai india kaa maananaa he ki gaiyr jatav daliton ne bhaajapa ko garibon ke liye chalane vaali kendriya yojanaon (muft silendar gas, shauchalay, muft ghar ) ke chalate pasand kiya

 On August 4, on a petition by Jaipur lawyer Bharat Bhushan Pareek, Supreme Court judges Justice Sudhanshu Jyoti Mukhopadhyay and S
K
 e
 Bobde's bench said, "first end the strike and then come before us on 8 August
 '' yachika asal main unke khilaaf jaipur ke baapu nagar main ek flats or bencement ko khaali karne ke faisle ke khilaaf thi
 Justice Mukhopadhyay had arrived in Rajasthan a day earlier
 unke daure kaa hadtaal se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha lekin vahaan unhone shaayad uskaa najaara dekha ho
 The bench had expressed concern over all one lakh lawyers going on strike since 9 July in Rajasthan
 yah hadtaal 7 july ko ek choti-si ghatana ke saath shuru hui thi, jab jila baar association ke vakil rajya sarkaar ke prastaav ke khilaaf adaalat kaa bahishkaar kar rahe the
 The state government had proposed to abolish the revenue courts and give their powers to divisional commissioners
 us din yani 7 july ko atirikt jila or satr nyaayadhish mahendra singh choudhary ne flats khaali karne ke faisle ke khilaaf pari kii yachika khaarij kar di
 But Pareek argued that his plea was not heard on the previous date of July 5, so it should be heard today
 pari or baar association ke adhyaksh gopesh kumbhaj samet unke vakeelon kii jaj ke saath kaaphi bahes hui
 His plea was that the order be withdrawn
 bakaul kumbhaj, ve jaj se kah rahe the ki 7 july ko chunki hadtaal kaa din he, koi bhi jaj pratikul aadesh nahin jari kar rahaa he, isliye unhen bhi aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 Pareek has been the tenant of that flat since 1998
 unka kahana he ki unke vaadi yamunanagar sugar mil ke ritair adhikari 79 varshiya ambarish chandra kudasia or unki patni 70 varshiya nutan ke paas jaaydaad kii milakiyat nahin he phir bhi vibhinn adaalaton ne unke daawey ko jaij tehraaya he
 According to Rajesh Sharma, the counsel for the elders, Pareek is wrong to say that the arguments on both sides in the court were completed only on July 5 and the verdict was only to be pronounced on July 7
 jaj choudhary nyaayik aadesh ko waapas lene ke dabaav se aahat hue or unhone ise avmaananaa qaraar dete hue record main darj kiya

 Kumbhaj says that the administration is not ready for transfer of both the judges
 is bich, ek nijee bedakhli ke maamle ko hadtaal kaa mudda banane ke liye aalochana hone lagi to vakeelon ne ranneeti badal di or prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa maamla uthaa diya
 Lawyers from India Today said that for every official work, the court staff asks for a bribe, whether to put the case file before the judge or a certified copy of the court orders
 pari kehete hai, ''ham isse ajiz aa chuke hai
 In my case, the notice of contempt just worked
 ''haalanki hadtaal khatm karne ke liye chal rahi baatcheet main bhrashtachar kaa mudda adta ja rahaa he jisase yah andeh bhi uth rahaa he ki vakil hadtaal khatm karne ko lekar gambhir hai yaa nahin
 In fact, their only condition to break the strike is transfer of both judges

 Khan was absconding since January 2013 and arrested on 23 May
 jamaanat milane ke baad 5 agast ko unhone india today se kaha, ''mere liye to hadtaal vardaan ban gai
 Pareek has been in controversy before

 He also had to go to jail, but later was acquitted

 On this, Pareek said that the matter is pending in the Supreme Court and fretfully demanded that his case be sent to another court
 is par jaj ne kaha ki aawaaj nichi karke baat kiijie
 Meanwhile, as a result of appearing in court, Pareek was expelled from the bar but this is an attempt to distance himself from his issue
 baharhaal, vakeelon kii hadtaal kii vajah se pehle se hi letlatif nyaay-vyavastha kii gati or manthar ho gai he jiskaa khamiyaja aam logon ko bhugatna pad rahaa hai
 (flat owner elderly couple Ambareesh Chandra Qudsia and his wife Nutan) 72 lawyers hurt and lawyers with the judiciary? During the hearing of Pareek's plea in the Supreme Court on August 4, Judge Mukhopadhyay indirectly referred to the lawyers' strike
 unhone pari ke vakil ramesh pi
 Asked Bhatt what do people think about lawyers? Bhatt said that in his state Gujarat, it is said that neither friendship nor enmity with lawyers, income tax officials and policemen is said
 is par jaj ne muskaraa kar ek duusari kahawat bataai, ''agar kisi sher se uljhe to 18 ghaav jheloge lekin pulisavaale se uljhe to 36 or vakil se uljhe to 72 chot khaaoge
 So, how many wounds are you thinking of suffering from the judiciary? Go and find a solution to the strike through dialogue

 Today the second era of Tamil Nadu politics came to an end
 diemke netaa em karunanidhi kaa dehanth ho gaya
 94-year-old Karunanidhi was hospitalized from 28 July
 tamilnadu main jayalalita or karunanidhi kaa lanbaa daur chalaa he
 After Jayalalithaa's demise on 5 December 2016, Tamil Nadu politics was passing through indefinitely
 5 baar mukhyamantri rahe em karunanidhi ke nidhan ne rajya kii raajnneeti kaa maidan khulaa chhod diya he
 The politics of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi was not just a politics of competition, both have drawn many lines at the level of ideology
 aaj screen par aap bhale hi karunanidhi ke udhaas or toote hue samarthakon ko dekh rahe hai magar is shaks ne tamilnadu kaa gazab kaa itihaas likhaa he
 You know that DMK was founded by Anna Durai
 is party main noujvaan netaa ke rup main em karunanidhi aae the
 Before this he was in journalism
 tamilnadu ke mahaan samaaj sudhaarak periyar ke kehane par unhone kudiyarasu patrika kaa sampadan chhod diya
 Karunanidhi later separated from Periyar and joined Anna
 unhone kai filmon kii script likhi he
 Karunanidhi and MGR became friends, in connection with the same film
 em ji aar gandhi ko maanane vaale the to ve karunanidhi ko gandhi par likhi kitaaben diya karte the or karunanidhi em ji aar ko anna durai kii likhi kitaaben diya karte the
 Karunanidhi earned a name as a script writer
 ve apni likhi filmon main em ji aar kaa naam sujhaate the
 MGR became a star overnight
 karunanidhi film likh rahe the or em ji aar super star ban rahe the
 One result of this friendship was that MGR left the Congress Party and joined the DMK in 1953
 anna durai or karunanidhi ne dekha ki em ji aar kii lokapriyata unke raajnneetik sandeshon ko failaane main khub kaam aa rahi he
 But this friendship did not last long
 karunanidhi jab mukhyamantri bane to em ji aar ne unase kaha ki mujhe swasthya mantri bana den, karunanidhi ne manaa kar diya
 Said to first stop acting and then become a minister
 is baat par alag-alag raay he ki em ji aar kyon karunanidhi se alag hue magar yah bhi itihaas kaa ek shandaar mode he ki em ji aar unase alag hokar eidiemke banaate hai or unke pratidwandi ban jate hai
 After that, the politics of the state and India becomes witness to the political competition of both for a long time
 pehle em ji aar kaa nidhan hua, uske lambey samay baad je jayalalita kaa or uske baad ab em karunanidhi
 The story is that even after the separation of MGR, Karunanidhi used to respect Karunanidhi so much that once the leader of his party did not name him with respect, he slapped and said that Karunanidhi is my leader
 main khud unhen kalanger kahata hum
 So this is the story which ended today
 tamilnadu ke log jo in do netaaon ke peeche raajnneetik pratispardhaa karte the, wo aaj kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe honge, yahaan dur se bataanaa mushkil he
 The farewells of the two greats of the politics of the South cannot be analyzed only by routine matters
 tippaniyan Of course Karunanidhi emerged from the politics of anti-hindi
 10 farvari 1969 ko pehali baar mukhyamantri bane the
 He was Chief Minister from 2003 to 2008
 ham upar se to jayalalita or karunanidhi kaa hi cheharaa dekhte rahe hai magar rajya kii zamin par donon dalon ke paas zarur shandaar kaaryakartaaon or sthaneey netaaon kii fouj rahi hogi jo donon kii raajnneeti ke stambh rahe honge
 Jayalalitha lived in the loop garden while Karunanidhi lived in Gopalapuram
 ek baar congress ne inaki sarkaar barkhaast kar di magar karunanidhi ne congress se milakar sarkaar bana lee or em ji aar kii sarkaar barkhaast karvaa di
 Then he met the Congress and contested the assembly and lost
 iske baad bhi upie sarkaar main partner rahe
 The quality of these leaders is that they have won elections many times, lost many times
 inke bich khud ko kehane vaali neshnal party kabhi jagah nahin bana saki
 Vinod k Hoze, editor of Caravan magazine, wrote a daily article on Karunanidhi in April 2011, titled 'the Last Year'
 isamen is baat kaa zikr he ki 1957 or 62 main jab diemke haar gai tab annadurai ne sochaa ki bagaiyr paise ke sirf vichaardhaara se jeet nahin milegi
 Then the DMK as treasurer said that he will deposit one million
 kisi ne yakeen nahin kiya
 Karunanidhi deposited over a million donations
 ek raily main annadurai ne unhen shriman gyaarah lakh kii oopaadhi di thi
 At the behest of the great social reformer of Tamil Nadu, Periyar, he quit editing Kudiyarasu magazine
 baad main karunanidhi periyar se alag hokar anna se jud gaye
 He has written scripts for many films
 karunanidhi or em ji aar kii dosti ho gai, isi film ke silsile main
 When MGR was supposed to accept Gandhi, he used to give books written on Gandhi to Karunanidhi and Karunanidhi used to give books written by Anna Durai to MGR
 script riter ke rup main karunanidhi ne khub naam kamaaya
 He used to suggest the name of MGR in his films
 em ji aar raaton raat star ban gaye
 Karunanidhi was writing the film and MGR was becoming a superstar
 is dosti kaa ek parinaam yah hua ki em ji aar congress party chhod 1953 main diemke main aa gaye
 Anna Durai and Karunanidhi saw that the popularity of MGR is very useful in spreading their political messages
 lekin yah dosti bahut lambii nahin chali
 When Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister, MGR asked him to make me Health Minister, Karunanidhi refused
 kaha ki pehle acting chodo phir mantri bano
 There are different opinions on why MGR split from Karunanidhi but it is also a great turn of history that MGR parted ways with them to form AIDMK and become their rivals
 uske baad rajya or bharat kii raajnneeti ek lambey daur tak donon kii siyaasi pratispardhaa kii gavaah banati he
 The first MGR died, followed by J
 Jayalalithaa long after that and now M
 Karunanidhi
 kahani to yah bhi ki he ki em ji aar alag hone ke baad bhi karunanidhi kii itani izzat karte the ki ek baar unki party ke netaa ne unka aadar se naam nahin liya to unhone chaanta jad diya or kaha ki karunanidhi mere netaa hai
 i call them Kalangar myself
 to ye kahani he jo aaj khatm ho gai
 How the people of Tamil Nadu who were competing politically behind these two leaders must be feeling today, it is difficult to tell from a distance here
 dakshin kii raajnneeti ke do mahanayakon kii vidaai kaa vishleshan sirf routine baton se nahin ho saktaa he
 The comments beshak karunanidhi hindi virodh kii raajnneeti se ubhare the
 Became Chief Minister for the first time on 10 February 1969
 2003 se 2008 tak mukhyamantri rahe
 We have been seeing the face of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi from above, but on the state land, both the parties must have had an army of brilliant workers and local leaders who have been the pillars of politics of both
 jayalalita pash garden main rahati thim to karunanidhi gopalpuram main
 Once the Congress sacked his government, but Karunanidhi joined the Congress and formed the government and got the MGR government sacked
 phir congress se milakar vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladaa or haar gaye
 Even after this, he remained a partner in the UPA government
 in netaaon kii khubi yah he ki kai baar chunaav jeeta he, kai baar haara he
 The National Party, which said itself among them, could never make a place
 kaaravaan patrika ke sampadak vinod ke hoje ne april 2011 main karunanidhi par rosek lekh likhaa he, jiskaa naam he 'di last year'
 It mentions that when DMK lost in 1957 and 62, Annadurai thought that mere ideology without money would not win
 tab koshadhyaksh ke rup me diemke ne kaha ki ve das lakh jamaa kar denge
 Nobody believed it
 karunanidhi ne das lakh se zyada chanda jamaa kar diya
 Annadurai gave him the title of Mr
 Eleven Lakhs at a rally
 karunanidhi film likh rahe the or em ji aar super star ban rahe the
 One result of this friendship was that MGR left the Congress Party and joined the DMK in 1953
