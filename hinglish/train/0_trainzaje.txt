 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ek baar phir apane twit ko lekar hansi kaa paatr ban gaye hai
 Trump, who spoke of the deaths of 13
8 million people in the Sri Lankan bombings, became a laughingstock because of the wrong spelling
 trump ne twitor par likhaa ki vishesh vakil robert mular ko congress ke samaksh pesh nahin hona chahie
 The US president had previously said that he would not prevent Muller from testifying and that a final decision would be taken by Artani General William
 mular kii 448 pannon kii jaanch report main 2016 ke america raashtrapati chunaav main roosi hastkshep sambandhi koi saboot nahin mili
 However, from his testimony, the Congress can get such new information which could not have been revealed otherwise
 Despite the tremendous success that i have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back
 
 
 
 
 Trump tweeted, 'despite many achievements including the greatest success I've had as president, perhaps the greatest economy of any president in history, and the most successful first two-year term, he stole two years of my presidential term (stollen) Who will never return
 'trump ne twit main angreji shabd ke ‘stolan' kii ssailing main do ‘el' laga die the, jiskaa arth masaalon tathaa sookhe yaa candid fruit kii ek fruit bread he
 Trump later corrected his mistake but by then his two-l word 'stollen' had become famous around the world

 After hoisting Vijay's flag in Chennai, Hyderabad and Mohali, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will now take on Ferozeshah Kotla ground against Australia for the fourth and final Test match with the intention of creating history on Friday
 agar team india dilli main jeet darj karti he to team 81 saal ke test itihaas main pehali baar koi siries 4-0 se jeetne main safal hogi

 Shahid Afridi: India against 45 balls in 2005 (brian Lara: Bangladesh against 45 balls 1999) myanmar ke rohingya muslim bhayaavah sthiti se peedit hai
 No country is ready to adopt Rohingya Muslims who have been deposed in their own country
 bharat main avaidh rup se kareeb 40 hajaar rohingya muslim rah rahe hai, jinhen waapas bhejne kii aawaaj bhi uth rahi he
 In such a situation, the Muslim religious leaders and leaders of India are also suffering from the pain of atrocities on Rohingya Muslims
 myanmar par modi sarkaar dabaav banaae: imam bukharidilli ke jama masjid ke shahi imam saiyad ahamed bukhari ne kaha kimyanmar main rohingya muslimonke saath jis barbar tareeke se julm ho rahaa he, vah insaaniyat ko sharmasaar karne vaala he
 We expect the Modi government to put pressure on the Myanmar government under human sympathy to stop the violence and slaughter

 In such a situation, the government will carry out the same tradition with Rohingya Muslims
 myanmar main UN kare dakhal: mufti mukarramdilli ke fatehpuri masjid ke imam moulana mufti mukarram ne kaha, myanmar main rohingya muslim par sarkaar kaa atyaachaar jari he or duniya khamosh he
 Myanmar is openly violating human rights and the United Nations is sitting quietly
 jabaki UN ko is maamle main dakhal dena chahie, taaki vahaan shanti sthapit ho sake
 Rohingya Muslims living in India should be sent back to Myanmar only after a permanent solution
 isse pehle unhen waapas bhejnaa insaaniyat ke khilaaf hoga

 Neither should i move away from Eman nor do i belong to humanity
 rohingya muslimon kii tasviir dekhakar ye ehsaas hua ki myanmar sarkaar jaalim ho chuki he
 Saudi Arabia's silence over the Rohingya Muslim's case is beyond comprehension
 saudi jinke haathon main tel detaa he wo haath unke bhai ke khoonon se sane hue hai
 Saudi Arabia seems to have changed its foreign policy, only then it is silent
 ang saan su se nobel puraskaar waapas liya janaa chahie: kamaal farrukimuslim personal lau board ke sadsy kamaal faruki kehete hai, myanmar main kaaphi pehle rohingya muslimon julm kar rahaa he or UN se lekar duniyabhar ke log khamosh he
 Aung San Suu should receive the Nobel Peace Prize
 kyonki aaj wo shanti ke khilaaf he
 In India, these victims are being viewed from the point of view of religion
 bharat ke kendriya grih rajyamantri kiran rijiju kaa bayaan sharmasaar karne vaala he
 India has always been aware that it has always been helping the victims
 srilanka se aae tamil hon yaa phir afghanistan ke afgani

 bangladesh se aae hue hinduon ko naagarikta dene kii baat karte lekin majaloom rohingya musalamaanon ko waapas bhejne kii baat karte hai
 The withdrawal of Rohingya Muslims is against international law: Salim Engineer: Salim Engineer, secretary-general of jamaat-e-islami Hind, says that we expected PM Narendra Modi to speak openly about Myanmar in Rohingya Muslims, but he has disappointed
 bharat kaa burma ke saath ek sambandh rahaa he
 In such a situation, India can resolve the issue of Rohingya Muslims
 rohingya muslim kaaphi sankhya main bharat main bhi rah rahe hai
 Meanwhile, some communal people are raising the issue of sending them back to Myanmar under these conditions
 jabaki antarrashtriya lau or insaaniyat donon isaki ijaajat nahin detii he

 Due to this, the State Government and the Central Government had to take many precautionary steps in Jammu and Kashmir last year

 Significantly, on 8 July, after the encounter of terrorist Burhan Wani, the stone was suddenly increased
 grih mantralay ne loksabhaa main likhit jawaab main kaha he ki april 2016 maheene 97 main baar kashmir main patharbaji hui
 In May and June 2016, there were 32 and 66 stone pelting incidents respectively
 lekin jaise hi aatanki burhan vaani kaa encounter suraksha balon ne kiya july main 837 baar kashmir ghati main alag alag jagahon par patharbaji hui

 uske baad ke aankade bataate hai ki patharbaji kam hui grih mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik november 2016 main jo ek maheene main 73 patharbaji kii ghatnaayen hui
 At the same time, only 36 and 17 stone pelting incidents occurred in December and January respectively
 isse saaf dikh rahaa ki notebandi kaa asar patharbaji main dikh rahaa he

 dengue or pradooshan, donon ko hi kam karne main hamen jo safalataa mili he, wo sabhi logon ke sahyog se hi ho paaya he
 'green firecrackers were used this time in Delhi, due to which air and noise pollution was reduced
 vaise mausam ke jaankaron ke mutabik dilli main is saal dashahra par itnaa kam pradooshan rahane ke do mukhya kaaran hai
 The first reason is that the monsoon is returning at this time due to which the wind speed is high
 hawa kii gati tej hone se jo pradooshan hota bhi he to vah ud jaataa he
 The second reason is that Punjab and Haryana still have a lot of moisture in the air, due to which the pollution caused by the burning of the straw is not coming towards Delhi

 Until the necessary documents from the auditors are provided, the three directors will remain in police custody
 police hiraasat main ek din se ek maheenaa bhi lag saktaa he
 It does not matter to us
 supreme court ne apane pehle ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin hone par kaha ki jab hamane 26 sitambar ko sabhi ricard 24 ghante main dene ko kaha tha, to ab tak aadesh kaa amal kyon nahin hua? sheersh adaalat ne dilli police, noida police or greater noida police ko aapas main samanvay karne or saare acount sambandhi record sij kar auditors ko daakhil karne ko kaha he

 bharat jaldi hi duniya kii sabase tej badhati hui arthvyavastha kaa kitaab hasil kar legaa or 2016 tak china ko peeche kar degaa
 All newspapers have prominently featured this prediction of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
 in donon sansthaaon kaa maananaa he ki 2016 main china kii jidipi ghatakar 6
 3 and India's rise to 7
 5 ho jaaegi
 It is not difficult for me to understand how much the economic world of India and China will change with a difference of one percent, but i cannot tell exactly why it is not a big deal
 vaise aaj ke 'times of india' main khabar chhapi he ki china kii arthvyavastha main 2009 ke baad sabase tej giravat ai he
 The world's second largest economy has not been sustained since 2009
 buudhvaar ko 'iconomik times' ne likhaa ki china se aage nikalne kii khabar sarkaar ko bhi pasand aegi, kyonki ham kabhi bhi china se aage nahin ja sake hai
 Then it is also argued that even if India went ahead, it would still be far behind in terms of the size of China's economy
 china kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar das trilayan he or bharat kaa do trillian
 You are small in size, but ahead in speed
 ye to sau meter ke trek par hota he, arthvyavastha kii daud main bhi hota he kya
 The Economic Times wrote that India is moving from consumption to investment economy, while China is now switching from investment to consumption economy
 buudhvaar ke hi 'iconomix times' main ek or khabar thi, lekin bheetar ke panne par
 India is consistently lagging behind in terms of exports
 vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ne kaha he ki duniya bhar main niryaat main giravat aa rahi he, kyonki duniya bhar kii arthvyavasthaaen abhi bhi najuk sthiti main he
 International trade growth rate in 20144
 7 pratishat bataai gai thi, lekin hui 2
 8 percent only
 vishwa vyapaar sanghathan or vishwa bank alag-alag aankalan kyon dete hai, isse mere jaise kamazor vidhyaarthee ko kanfuzan ho jaataa he
 Japan and the Netherlands are overtaking in terms of services exports
 bharat chathe se aathven sthaan par aa gaya he
 India also formulated a five-year export policy, which has drawn many criticisms
 balki modi samarthak un udyogpatiyon ne akhbaaron main lekh likhakar niryaat niti par sawaal uthaae hai
 Yet if you look at the confidence of the government, it seems that it is quite confident that the economy is turning
 aaj ke 'times of india' ke pehle panne par ek or khabar chhapi he
 The growth rate of lending by Indian banks is at the lowest level in the last 18 years
 saamaanya rup se ham yah to samajhate hi honge ki arthvyavastha main tezi aati he, to companiyaan nivesh ke liye bainkon se koob karz leti hongi
 There is a debt of 8 lakh crores more than last year, but such a small increase was last seen in 1996-97
 kya ham vahaan pahunch gaye
 The government says that it has approved the pending projects
 bank kehete hai ki jab sarkaar lambit pariyojnaon ko chaalu karegi, tab shaayad karzon kaa uthaan hone lagegaa
 We understand that there cannot be a complete picture of the economy
 yahaan giravat hogi to vahaan tarakkee, lekin ek khabar padhakar na to utsaah kii aarthik samaj mukammal he na niraashaa kii
 Today, the Hindu newspaper has written in its editorial that between 1990 and 2013, China's annual growth rate has been ten percent
 bharat apane behatar dinon main bhi 9 pratishat se aage nahin ja sakaa
 If India has to provide employment to one crore 20 lakh youth, then it will have to develop at the rate of 7 to 8 percent for the next ten years
 china main arthvyavastha kaa yah sankat tab he, jab vahaan shat-pratishat bijli he
 One-fourth of the households in India are away from electricity
 china kii prati vyakti aay bharat se teen guna zyada he
 What is the destination in this journey is not known
 jo viksit he wo bhi sankat main he or jo vikasshil hoga uskaa jashn he
 In June last year, MINXIN PEI wrote in the Indian Express that by the end of the year China is going to become the world's largest economy
 haalanki is saal yah hua nahin phir bhi agar ban jaataa, to 1872 se koi bhi desh pehali baar america se aage nikalataa
 Pei writes that this news was published in newspapers all over the world, but China ignored it
 sarkari samachar patron main isaki koi khabar tak nahin chhapi
 Beijing lobbied with the World Bank to stop the number one announcement
 iske apane kaaran bhi ginaye gaye hai ki sabase badi arthvyavastha hone par duniya bhar main aarthik madad bhi deni padegi
 There will be unnecessary pressure on the Chinese government to spend 37 percent on social security instead of 15 percent like the US
 china ko laga ki number van ke elaan se kuch phayda nahin he
 The weather in India has put farming in jeopardy
 sarkaar ne muawza badhaane kaa elaan to kiya he, magar kahin bhi tej gati se survey nahin ho rahe hai or kisaanon ke haath main saat sau-aath sau rupee hi pahunch rahe hai
 Farmers are demanding loan waiver
 duusari taraf maharashtra se khabar aa rahi he ki vahaan 55 saal ke itihaas main ganne kaa sabase adhik utpaadan ho gaya he
 Sugarcane has become so much that sugar prices have come down drastically
 chini milon ko sarkari rate par ganne kaa bhugtan karnaa he, magar unki chini kaa rate market main 700 prati quital gir gaya he
 The government and consumers will be happy with this, but the farmer is crying because the sugar mills have stopped his 4500 crore rupees
 maang ho rahi he ki sarkaar china kharid kar stock kare
 Overall, there are different economic circumstances
 antarrashtriya reating agency bharat kii taareef kar rahi hai, to desh main alag-alag halaat hai
 Both good and bad
 videsh dauron par pradhanmantri ke utsaah or aatmavishvaas ko dekhakar ek baar yakeen karne kaa man karata he ki kya pataa wo us kursi se dekh rahe hon ki sab kuch thik he
 The country is progressing
 isliye unke daure ko ek harshollas ke event main badla ja rahaa he
 But when i see different news stories in newspapers, there is no such situation that a celebration should be organized in a stadium
 kya aapako lagata he ki arthvyastha badal rahi he? badlaav aisa he ki sabko kuch na kuch mil rahaa he? ye aapako lagata he yaa aap thik-thik jaanate hai?

 maharashtra ke siem ke taur par shapath lene se thik pehle BJP netaa devendra fadanvis ne bada bayaan diya he
 After bjp's alliance with Shiv Sena, we are going to give a strong and stable government in the state
 unhone yah baat party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kii
 Devendra Fadnavis said that the process to form the government will be started from Diwali onwards
 janata jo janadesh diya he vah bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke paksh main he
 And we are going to give a stable and strong government in the state in the coming days
 devendra fadanvis kaa yah bayaan us samay aayaa he jab shivasena ne rajya main bijepi shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane se pehle 50-50 formule par likhit main dene kii baat kahi he
 a few days ago Shiv Sena said this after meeting with all its mlas
 vidhayak dal kii baithak main faisla liya gaya tha ki pehle bijepi likhit main de ki vah dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri vaale yani 50-50 vaale formule par raji he
 After finishing the meeting, Shiv Sena MLA Ramesh said that all rights have been given to Uddhavji
 jo wo kahenge vahi hoga
 At the same time, another Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik had said that the BJP will not join the Shiv Sena government until it gives it in writing
 jo tay hua he 50 - 50 formula uske tahat dhai dhai saal kaa mukhyamantri hona chahie
 Most of the Shiv Sena mlas of Maharashtra want that this time Shiv Sena should be given the post of Chief Minister and this post should be given to Aditya Thackeray
 in vidhayakon kaa kaa kahana he ki unke paas nai soch he
 Shiv Sena has got 56 seats in the assembly elections
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi ko pichley baar kii tulana main kareeb 20 siten kam ai hai or vah usko sarkaar banane ke liye kisi tisare kii har haal main samarthan kii jarurat padegi
 The Shiv Sena wants to take advantage of this because the BJP had contested alone in the last election and completely captured the government
 lekin is baar halaat badal gaye hai
 This is the reason why Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has shared the tiger (shiv Sena symbol) on a cortoon tweeter, which has a watch around its neck (NCP symbol) and a lotus flower in the hand (bjp's election symbol)
 maharashtra main ek or charchaa yah bhi he ki ensipi shivasena kaa samarthan kar sakati he
 Everyone wants to find peace in life
 offis main kaam karne waalon kii baat to ab aam ho gai, skool ke bachche ke paas bhi silebus kaa pahaad tension liye khadaa he

 Meira Kumar, a Dalit face of a diplomat-turned-politician from Congress, has come a long way until she was elected to the post of the first woman Lok Sabha Speaker of the world's largest democracy after entering electoral politics in the mid-1980s
 mira kumaar congress ke divangat netaa jagjivan ram kii putree hai
 In the last fortnight, Meera Kumar's name was suddenly agreed after the name of Andhra Pradesh Congress leader Kishore Chandra Dev came to prominence for the post of Lok Sabha Speaker
 64 varshiya mira kumaar ne 1985 main bhartiya videsh seva kii naukari chhodkar raajnneeti main pravesh kiya tha
 She has been elected MP five times
 unhone 2002 main congress netritv se matbhed hone ke baad party se istipha de diya tha
 However, after two years, she returned to the party again
 mira kumaar sabase pehle pivi narsingh raav ke mantrimandal main upamantri bani thi or 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab samprag ne satta kii bagdor sanbhali to unhen cabinet str kaa mantri banaaya gaya
 The decision to elect him to the post of Lok Sabha Speaker was taken just two days after Manmohan Singh took charge of the Ministry of Water Resources in his second term
 vidhi snaatak or angreji main master degree praapt mira ko 1973 main bhartiya videsh seva ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 He served in the embassies of Spain, Britain and Mauritius
 vah bharat-marishas ke sanyukt ayog kii sadsy bhi raheen
 The soft-spoken Meera was elected a Lok Sabha member in 1985 from Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh
 vah dilli kii karolbaag seat se 1996 or 1998 main saansad chuni gayi
 But when the NDA came to power in 1999, she lost the election
 vah 2004 main bihar ke sasaram se loksabhaa sadsy chuni gayin or unhen centre main saamaajik nyaay or adhikarita mantri banaaya gaya
 Sasaram was his father's constituency
 mira kumaar 1990 se 1992 tak congress kii mahasachiv raheen
 After this, she also held this position from 1996 to 1998
 vah pehali baar 1990 main congress kaaryakarini samiti kii sadsy baniin or 2000 tak is pad par raheen
 Significantly, after a gap of two years, she again joined the Congress Executive in 2002 and remained a member till 2004
 mira kaa janm 31 march 1945 ko patna main hua tha
 He studied at Indraprastha College of Delhi University and Miranda House
 unhone spanish bhashaa main advanced diploma bhi kiya tha
 He has also received a medal for rifle shooting
 vidhi kii degree ke saath vah ucchtam nyaayalay baar eshociation kii 1980 main sadsy bani
 She was married to Manjul Kumar, a Supreme Court lawyer
 unki ek betaa or do betiyaan hai
 Prafulla Kumar Mahant is the face of Indian politics who achieved the title of becoming the youngest Chief Minister at just 32 years old
 mahant pehali baar 1985 main assam ke mukhyamantri bane
 Mahanta led the Assam movement
 pehali baar jab 1985 main assam gana parishad ko bahumat mila to taj prafull kumaar mahant ke sir sajaa
 a leadership ability from childhood, Prafulla Kumar Mahant was born on 23 December 1952 in Nagaon, Assam
 bachapan se hi inamen netritv kii kshamta thi
 He received his graduation degree from Guwahati University and then became active in politics
 mahant raajnneeti kii seedhiyaan chadhate ja rahe the
 But like shadows, controversy was also following
 saal 1985-90 kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad mahant ek baar phir 1996 se 2001 tak assam ke mukhyamantri kii kursi par kabiz hue
 But in the meantime, his politics dominated the controversy
 chaaron taraf se aaropon kii bauchhaar hone lageen or phir 2001 main unhen majabuuran satta chhodani padi
 Along with the success, the omnipotent power was also evicted from the post of Mahantparty
 aarope sangeen the or gumnami peechha kar rahaa tha
 Mahanta was accused of killing the family members of ULFA leaders by going outside his jurisdiction
 nijee jindagi main bhi vivaad ne ghar kar liya tha or vivahetar sambandhon ke aarope lage
 a party faction showed the Mahanta a way out of the party overnight
 duniya ke sabase kam umr main mukhyamantri banakar itihaas rachane vaale mahant achaanak do dashak ke bheetar assam kii raajnneeti main achhut ho gaye
 But Mahanta did not give up and formed a separate party called Assam Gana Parishad (progressive)
 or 2006 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kud pade
 Only Mahanta could win this election
 party ke baaki ummidavaaron ko karaari haar mili
 There was a time when he returned to Huiparty in 2008 when it seemed that all doors were closed for Prafulla Kumar Mahanta in the Assam Gana Parishad
 tatkaaleen adhyaksh vrundavan goswami ne mahant ko kabhi party main nahin lautne dene kii kasam tak kha lee thi
 The All Assam Students Union (AASU) started an anti-mahant campaign
 vahiin duusari ore mahant ke bina assam gana parishad dinon-din kamjor hoti ja rahi thi
 When Chandramohan Patwari became the president of the party in 2008, the path of Mahant's return started to open
 patawaari is baat se waakif the ki party ko phir se majboot mahant hi kar sakate hai
 He not only convinced the Mahant, but also other rebel leaders and brought him back to the party
 bure vakt main yoga kaa saharamhant bhi maanate hai ki unakijindgimen wo sabase bura vakt tha
 But instead of cursing, he used the time to connect with people
 logon kii raishumaari karne lage ki aakhir galati kahaan hui or use kaise sudhara jaae
 He also made yoga and prayer a part of his life in difficult times
 mahant kaa daawa he ki khud pradhanmantri banane se inkaar karne vaale jyoti basu ne 1996 main dilli ke assam bhawan main sanyukt morcha kii ek baithak main unke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 But Mahanta had politely refused

 BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav on Sunday said that Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has more importance than party president Amit Shah in matters related to the region in the Northeast
 ram madhav ne yah puche jane par yah baat kahi ki 25 siton kaa jimmedaar hone ke baavjood sarama chunaav kyon nahin lard sakate jabaki amit shah bhaajapa adhyaksh hone ke baad bhi gandhi nagar se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Ram Madhav said at a press conference here, "this means that perhaps Himanta Biswa Sarma is more burdened than Amit, because he has to handle 5-6 governments here
" unhen purvottar main puure chunaav kaa abhiyaan sanbhaalanaa he
 "actually, the state unit of BJP was demanding Himanta Biswa Sarma to contest the Lok Sabha elections, but the party's national president Amit Shah had put a stop to all the speculation by tweeting that Sarma should be tapped into the state's development and the party's base in the Northeast
 It has been said to focus on strengthening
 himant sarama ne bhi kaha ki unhone "vinamratapurvak" faisle ko sweekaar kar liya he or kshetra narendra modi ko phir se pradhanmantri banane main amit shah ko niraash nahin karegaa
 However, before this, Sarma himself had stated on several occasions that he would not contest assembly elections in the state in 2021, as well as indicated that he was now looking for a national role
 bhaajapa sutron ne kaha ki chunaav ke liye rajya ikai ke naamon kaa panel taiyaar karte samay unhen assam ke pratishthit tejpur sansadeey kshetra ke ummidavaar ke rup main namit kiya gaya tha
 However, this did not happen
 ram madhav ne yah bhi kaha ki party himant sarama ko assam se rajyasabha main bhejne par vichaar kar sakati he
 Not only this, another senior BJP leader also said that Sarma will convince the younger members of the party and sympathizers who are unhappy over not giving them tickets

 Some people have also been arrested by registering a case with the police

 In the case, Rohini District Police PCR was informed about Abhishek's death at 10 am on Tuesday

 After which the police conducted a post-mortem of the body and handed over the body to the relatives
 police adhikariyon ne bataaya ki abhishek kaa bada bhai ravi praivet naukari karata he
 Ravi was quoted by police as saying that about 15 days ago, he and Abhishek had gone to the ancestral village of Farrukhabad relative with their father Darshan Lal and mother Kushma Devi
 beete ravivaar ko vah abhishek ko lekar waapas ghar aa gaye the kyonki ravi ko duty or abhishek ko skool janaa tha
 On Monday night, both had gone to sleep on the terrace after having dinner
 police ne bataaya ki us dauraan abhishek ravi ko kai baar chat par garmi lagane kii baat kah rahaa tha
 After which Ravi gave Abhishek the key to the room and Abhishek went to sleep in the room
 subah jab ravi ne abhishek se sampark karne ke liye phone kiya to usne phone nahin uthaaya
 Ravi came to the room after not picking up the phone several times, where Abhishek was lying on the floor and his hands and feet were tied with wire
 uske gale main bhi taar kaa fanda laga hua tha
 After this, neighbors heard the sound of Ravi's shouting
 abhishek ko achetavastha main sanjay gandhi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 At the same time, after registering a case with the police, some people have been detained by the police and they are being questioned

 The Indian cricket team, which is struggling with the fitness problems of the players, will descend on England with the intention of opening the account of victory in the second ODI after the first ODI rain
 vishwa champion bhartiya team shanivaar ko pehla vanade jeetne kii sthiti main thi lekin barish ne rang main bhang daal diya
 However, new fitness problems also emerged from this match
 ballebaaj rohit sharma ungali main fracture ke kaaran shrinkhalaa se baahar ho gaye jabaki sachin tendulkar ke pair kii ungaliyon kaa dard phir ubhar aayaa he
 Tendulkar's condition is improving but he will not be able to play tomorrow
 rohit kii jagah manoj tiwari ko team main shaamil kiya gaya he lekin vah bhi kal nahin khelegaa
 The positive thing is the good form of openers Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rahane who faced the England fast bowlers well
 vinay kumaar ne bhi behatar gendbaaji kii
 Ravinder Jadeja can play tomorrow's match
 baayen haath se upyogi spin gendbaaji karne vaale jadeja achche fielder bhi hai
 In the last season of the IPL, he also showed batting jauhar
 yuvaraj singh ke vikalp ke taur par team main shaamil kiye gaye jadeja haalanki pichley 10 antarrashtriya maichon main 87 ran hi bana sake hai
 In the current situation, Mahendra Singh Dhoni cannot be criticized as most of the top players are injured
 bharat kii vishwa cap team ke sirf chaar khilaadi hi feet hai jinamein viraat kohli, suresh raina, mahendra singh dhoni or munaf patel shaamil hai
 In such a situation, it is logical to expect him to win and the title of world champion will also not prove to be helpful
 bharat ke liye kamyaabi kii kunjee us tarah kii ballebaaji hogi jo chester lee street main dekhne ko mili thi
 In such a situation, it may be difficult for England bowlers under the floodlight
 bhartiya team main praveen kumaar ke rup main acha tej gendbaaj he
 It has proved difficult for the England openers to play him
 elestare cook or craig keeswaitor ke liye use khelnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The opening pair has been a big headache for England in the last few years
 england ne pichley 96 vanade main 19 jodiyon ko aajamaaya he or prayog abhi bhi jari he
 If the Indian team could score well then the bowlers will get help

 There is considerable evidence that the Indian economy is currently in a complete recession
 audyogic utpaadan ke suchakank main badhotaree, jo udyog kii haalat dikhaane vaala ek ahm paimaana he, do saal main sabase nichle bindu par rahi or pichhali aath timahiyon main usamen lagaataar giravat hoti aa rahi he
 The increase in exports, it seems, reached the peak in June when it touched an astonishing 82 per cent and is likely to increase marginally in the coming months
 april ke baad gaiyr-khaadya mad main karj kii maang bhi mahaj 2
 At 5 per cent, it shows that the stir in private investment has almost come to a standstill
 nai pariyojnaon kii ghoshnaaen bhi lagbhag band ho gai hai or companiyon ke paas nakadi kaa record bhandar ho gaya he tathaa ve apni kshamta main vistaar ke liye nivesh karne main naakaam hai
 Lack of electricity is becoming a big problem

 For the first time in my life, i see that Indian investors, who are looking for an opportunity to invest abroad, are avoiding putting money by looking at the danger in the country
 iskaa nateeja yah hoga ki mandi lambii chalegi or lagaataar bani rahegi
 This truth cannot be denied that the underlying structural features of the Indian economy can take it on the path of 8-9 per cent growth
 in dhanchaagat khoobiyon main jansankhya kaa mufeed dhaancha, bachat kii oonchi dar, udhyam kaa saahas, badhate ja rahe madhyam varg main behatar chizon kii badhati maang, nivesh kii anginat sambhaavnaaen or videsh main bhartiya arthvyavastha kii acchhee chhavi shaamil hai
 In such a situation, when expectations are sky high, it is very disappointing for people that they are facing slowdown in development, unemployment and decline in purchasing power
 meraa pakkaa bharosa he ki is tarah kii chakree mandi ko roka ja saktaa tha
 We have the example of China, which has 9 GDP in three decades with minimum inflationary pressure
 5 fisadi kii vikaas dar hasil kii
 The argument that India's democracy does not allow us to imitate China is merely an excuse to avoid the issue
 hamaare loktantr main is tarah kii koi baat nahin he jo hamen aisi vicasonmukh nitiyon par amal karne se rokatii ho, jinase rojgaar paidaa hoga or matadaata aisi nitiyon kii saraahna hi karenge
 The problem is not in our democracy, but perhaps due to the misconception that distributing free wadis to the voters will strengthen them
 bharat jaisi garib arthvyavastha zyada samay tak yah boj nahin dho sakati he ki uski bahut badi aabaadi sabsidiyon par nirbhar rahe
 If we want to avoid wastage, we have to bring such schemes which will increase people's purchasing power
 asli vikaas tabhi ho saktaa he jab kaaryashakti main harek vyakti ko utpaadak or acchhee tankhwaah vaala rojgaar muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 For this, structural reforms will have to be maintained, which will make India a suitable destination for foreign investors
 kaarobaar ke liye mufeed thikaanon ke maamle main 183 deshon main se bharat kaa 134waan sthaan bataata he ki yahaan ab bhi acha maahaul nahin he
 Therefore, the time is right for us to continue the reform agenda
 rajnatik varg ke ek bade tabake main yah manyata ghar kar gai lagati he ki bharat kii jansankhya or sakal gharelu utpaada kii 7-8 fisadi vikaas dar hameshaa majbootee detii rahegi
 Due to this perception, a sense of ease comes in the policies and a populist race starts, which was seen in the last few years
 yah khatarnaak he kyonki kai pichhali misaalen dikhaati hai ki logon ko majboot banaakar or nitiyon main samay-samay par badlaav karke hi aabaadi kaa phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Conflict between development and equity can be avoided only when the government plays its important role in promoting development and providing better service to the public
 hamen yah vichaar chhod dena chahie ki sarkaar kii bhoomika ke bina aarthik vikaas hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Instead we should insist on providing better public services so that both faster growth and investment can be possible
 afat kaa intjaar karne ke bajaae maujuuda mandi kaa istemaal jaruri sudhaar shuru karne ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 Such a crisis may have to pay a heavy price in an environment of rising expectations and panic

 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has termed the martyrdom of CRPF jawans as 'political victims'

 While the video of Abhinandan went viral on social media, people strongly appealed for the return of Abhinandan and also requested to postpone the war
 soshal media site twitor par inhen pratikriyaaon ke chalate bring back abhinandan or se-no-tu-waar jaise hashtag trend karne lage
 It is noteworthy that during the 12 days of the Pulwama attack, other opposition parties, including the ruling parties, continued their political programs with the slogan of revenge for martyrdom

 basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne airstrike ko saahasik karrwai to jarur bataaya, saath hi bijepi kii sarkaar par sena ko pehle free hand nahin dene kaa sawaal bhi khadaa kar diya
 However, before the Prime Minister sent his ministers in a final farewell to the martyrs of Pulwama, where the Congress tried to cheer the victims' families, the Congress party looked a little ahead in canceling its program
 congress adhyaksh ne to party kii kaarysmiti kii baithak tak sthagit kar di
 Apart from this, the meeting of opposition parties on the common program also ended without passing any political resolution
 jabaki duusari taraf congress ne pradhanmantri ke photo shoot ke bahaane modi sarkaar ko gherne ke avasar kaa laabh uthaaya
 The government and the party were spoiled by this and the BJP was seen giving clarification

 Because there is a Modi government at the Center, questions are being raised more on them and the opposition is also trying to protect themselves by going a little tricky

 PC Mohanan and member JV Meenakshi, acting chief of the National Statistical Commission, resigned in protest against whether the government is pressing unemployment figures
 inkaa kahana he ki 5 disambar 2018 ko hi neshnal sample survey kaa data manzur kar sarkaar ko de diya gaya tha magar aaj tak jari nahin hua
 There were many such things in this data which could cause trouble to the government
 is vakt berojgaare ko lekar raajnneetik mudda garmaya hua he, aise main berojgaare ke aankade jari na karne kaa aarope sarkaar par lage, uske liye acha nahin he
 After this resignation, there are now only two members in the four-member National Statistical Commission
 je ve minakshi dilli skool aaf ichonmiks main professor hai or pi si mohanan indian statistical sarvice ke sadsy rahe hai
 After this resignation, only Chief Statutory Pravin Srivastava and Amitabh Kant of NITI Aayog are left
 bijness standard ke dilaasha, ishan bakshi or somesh jha ne pi si mohanan kaa bayaan bhi apni report main daalaa he
 Mohanan says that it seemed to us for several months that no one was taking us seriously and was being sidelined
 neshnal statistical kamishan ke faislon ko lagu nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 Business Standard wrote that the government was not comfortable with the new NNSO figures
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal july main is kamishan ne jidipi aankadon kii samiksha kar bataaya tha ki upie ke samay 2010-11 main jidipi 10
 It was 08 percent
 magar sarkaar ne unki report palat di
 One reason for the resignation is also being mentioned
 berojgaare kaa aankada pataa karne kii report kaa ye haalat he to berojgaaron yaa logon ko bhatta dene kaa data kitna vishwasaneey hoga aap andaaza laga sakate hai
 Experiments have been going on for the Universal Basic Income since the 1960s
 kenya main 12 saal se ek prayog chal rahaa he
 Charity organization of America gives some money to 21000 adults every month and see what has changed in their life by spending or investing that money
 hamane jo thodi bahut padhai kii he usase yahi pataa chalaa ki in prayogon se bahut thos nattejey nahin nikle hai jisase aadhaar par ham yah samaj saken ki is skim ke raste main ham falaan falaan chiz hasil kar sakate hai
 This does not mean that its trial has been stopped, rather it is being tried in many places in one form or the other
 2016 main finland or sweetzaraland main is prayog or idia ko riject kar diya gaya
 In the same year, this idea enters the Economic Survey of India, but by 2019, there is talk about it
 magar bharat pehla desh he duniya kaa jahaan universil basic incum ke kai model bade str par laanch ho chuke hai
 Raitu Bandhu in Telangana and Kalia Project of Odisha
 28 janvari ko raipur main rahul gandhi ne rajya se upar uth kar desh ke str par universal basic incum skim dene kii baat kar di
 Then later the media has reported that 1500 rupees a month will be given in the account of the poor
 isse sarkaar ke bajet par kitna bhaar padegaa, kya puraani yojanaon ko band kar is yojana ke tahat paise die jaaenge yaa phir wo chalati rahengi or ek or nai skim jud jaaegi
 p Chidambaram has said that we will give details in our manifest and meanwhile Arvind Subramanian and Josh Felman, Boban Paul, M, who gave its imagination a place in the Economic Survey
 R
 Sharan, together wrote an article in Business Standard and named his plan QUBRI- QUASI UNIVERSAL BASIC RURAL INCOME
 rahul gandhi sabhi garibon ko basic incum dene kii baat karte hai
 For the moment, we assume that they are talking about both the urban poor and the rural poor
 lekin arvind subramanyam or unke saathi saaf saaf sirf gramin bharat ke garibon ko basic incum dene kii baat karte hai
 60 to 80 percent of the people of rural India have to be brought under its purview
 60 se neeche karenge to jo sabase garib hai wo chhot jaaenge or 80 se zyaada karenge to jo gramin sampann hai unhen bhi laabh milegaa
 For this, they have to be identified who are to be excluded from the scheme
 jin kisaanon ke paas 3 yaa 4 pahie vaala kheti kaa upkaran ho, 50,000 kii karz seemaa vaala credit cart ho, sarkari naukari yaa sarkaar ke yahaan panjikrut gair krishi bijness ho, ghar kaa koi bhi sadsy 10
 Earns more than Rs
 000, be an income tax payer, has more than 3 rooms and 2
 5 acre zamin ho
 Arvind Subramaniam has said that by using the already existing rural socio-economic Caste Census (SECC), we can sort such rich people and give basic income to the rest
 yahi wo aankada he jiskaa istemaal pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke liye hota he to isi ke aadhaar par basic incum shuru ha saktaa he
 For this, 1500 to 1800 rupees per month or 18000 rupees will be given in four installments in a year
 2 lakh 64 hazaar karod kaa kharchaa aayega jise ken or rajya milakar aadha aadha vahan karenge
 Now the question is, where will the money come from, then the idea is that the additional minimum support price will be stopped by 10,000 crores
 fasali rin par byaaz sabsidi band karne se 15,000 karod aa jaaenge
 11,000 crore rupees will be closed by crop insurance scheme
 teen saal main khaad sabsidi band kar 70,000 aa jaaenge
 If the money for this scheme has to be discontinued, then this scheme will never be applicable
 kyonki atirikt nunatam samarthan mulya, fasal beemaa or khaad sabsidi ko band karne kaa faisla raajnneetik he or itnaa aasaan nahin he
 We do not know why the crop insurance scheme should be discontinued
 kya 1500 rupee basic incum de dene ke baad fasal nasht nahin hoge
 The rich farmers who have been excluded will not have to compensate after the loss
 kya is 1500 rupee main gramin aabaadi beemaa kaa premium de degi, khaad sabsidi kii jagah uria ko mahange daamon par kharid sakegi? jo input cast badhegaa uskaa kya hoga
 What will be the new system by abolishing MSP, is there any courage in any government to stop MSP? Arvind Subramanian's team has an idea about the basic income, but there is no concrete idea of where the money will come from
 unhone to 2016 ke survey main sarkaar ko iske liye aarthik survey kii baat kahi thi, kya wo hui he
 Similarly, on 7 January 2017, Surjit s Bhalla wrote a full article in the Indian Express on basic income
 unhone bhi ek hisaab diya tha
 1 from MNREGA and Public Distribution System
 75 lakh karod kaala dhan paidaa hota he
 The Prime Minister says that 100% leakage was stopped, where did Bhalla saheb get this data from? baharhaal bhalla sahab chaahate hai ki in do yojanaon ko band kar dene par sahmati banaai jaae or usase jo bachegaa vyaskon ko basic incum saport diya ja saktaa he
 Economists Zandez and Ritika Kheda have raised questions in several of their articles on raising funds for basic income by discontinuing the earlier social security schemes
 ek to unki aapatti isi baat se he ki jab in yojanaon ke asar par itane achche adhyayan maujuud hai to kaise licage ko aadhaar banaakar unhen band karne kii baat kii ja sakati he
 Can the objective of these schemes be achieved with basic income? One question is from everyone involved in this debate
 ham basic incum se kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 We want to overcome the crisis of farming, to overcome the crisis of rural India or to make a new option of social security
 mujhe ye kanfusion dikh rahaa he isliye apana sawaal uthaa rahaa hum
 Basic income is envisaged in Chapter 9 of the Government of India Economic Survey 2016-17
 usamen arvind subramanyam ne likhaa he ki azaadi ke samay bharat main 70 pratishat log garib the, 2011-12 tak 22 pratishat garib rah gaye
 Many plans may have been in the hands of 70 to 22 percent
 48 fisadi garibi hamane bagaiyr basic inakam ke hasil kii he
 Now why basic income is necessary to come to 22 percent to 0 percent
 arthshaatri jaan dej ne apane ek puraane lekh main sawaal uthaaya he ki jo paisa diya ja rahaa he wo jeene kii basic laagat ke baraabar hona chahie
 On the basis of this, you wonder if anyone can live on 1500 rupees monthly? Arvind Subramaniam says that a family earning 56000 annually should get one third of its earnings i
e
 18000 so that it gets additional economic capacity
 ek sawaal he kya ham vaaki ek behatar saamaajik suraksha network bana rahe hai
 Shouldn't we create a network in which everyone feels safe
 dilli main sarkari karmchaaree jantar mantar par apni saamaajik suraksha ke liye anshan kar rahe hai
 These people are demanding the old pension system
 kyonki ritair hone ke baad bhujaa khaane kaa bhi paisa nahin rahegaa to kaise kaam chalegaa jab ye samaj aayaa he to yahaan anshan kar rahe hai
 How pensions can be excluded from the understanding or debate of social security networks
 kya basic incum saamaajik suraksha skim he yaa phir aarthik sahaayta skim he jiske tahat aapako kuch paise die ja rahe hai
 If you ask anyone if they have faith in the new pension system, economists should tell who has made their pension worth living with the new pension system, then what will happen to their questions
 pichley kai maheenon se puraani pension vyavastha kii bahaali ko lekar andolan jor pakad rahaa he
 The media may not be talking knowledgeable but the ordinary government employee is feeling insecure about his future
 arvind subramanyam or unki toli kaa ek tark or he
 The Raitu brothers of Telangana are going to benefit affluent farmers
 urisa ke kaaliya skim main bantidaar or khetihar mazaduron ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he magar unki pahchaan kaise hogi, abhi dekhnaa hoga
 Therefore, not only farming but rural areas have been kept in their model

 com / 0zrdgs2u5g Half Girlfriend is Chetan Bhagat's fourth novel on which the film is made
 isse pehle unke nowell van nite ait kol centre par hello, 3 mystex of maay life par kaay po che or 2 stats par isi naam kii film ban chuki he
 Aamir Khan's 3 Idiots, directed by Rajkumar Hirani, was inspired by Chetan Bhagat's debut novel Five Point Someone
 chitrakoot se kareeb bees kimi dur bharat coop ke chote se gaanv main bhaiyaram yadav kii pahari aapako dur se hi dikh jaaegi
 On reaching the hill, you stop by a long series of fruitful trees and stop near Bhairam Yadav's hut
 garmi main paatha ke is ilaake ke pahaad jab tapate hai to bhaiyaram kaa chalis hajaar pedo vaala ye jangal thandi bharaa sukun detaa he
 When i reached him, he was about 55 years of age, moderately tall
 
 He met with a light body and a light smile on his dark face in the sun
 patni or bete kii maut ke baad ped hi unka parivaar ban gaya
 After 2007, Bhaiyaram brought the forest department's plants and planted them around the hill
 
 Then from two km away, every day thirty to forty matka used to fill the water and irrigate the plants
 13 saal ke unki athak mehnat ke nattejey ke taur par khadey jangal ko dikhaate dikhaate bhaiyaram isi main kho jate hai
 Even if they cannot read any letter of the book, the text of their plantation should be included in every environmental book
 koi or hota to van vibhaag ke die gaye 40 hajaar paudhon ko ped banane kaa certificate dikhaakar darjanon puraskaar jhatak letaa lekin chah maheenaa pehle lagavaaye gaye van vibhaag ke handpump ko chalaate ve kehete hai ki bhaiya mere bhagwaan to ye ped hai
 As long as their shadow is there, i have everything
 pani kii killat se jujh rahe bundelkhand ke banda jile main 19 lakh paudhe lagaae gaye hai
 
 ye paudhe kis halaat main he ye jaanane ham banda jile ke kalinger kile ke paas bahadur poor main pahunche
 To find plants planted in this 220 hectare forest, one had to struggle from car to foot
 paudharopan kaa koi board or marking na hone ke chalate in ghani jhaadiyon main paudhe lagaakar chhod diya gaya
 If found some lags, only dry plants can be seen in many places
 ham jaise-jaise ghani jhaadiyon main aage bade to yahaan paudhe lagane ke nishaan kaali panniyon main mili
 We were just looking for traces of plantation in this forest when it was revealed that Anokal Lal's house in Giddiha village has a 2016 plantation board
 2016 main hue paudharopan main yahaan 2500 paudhe lagaae gaye or 3000 beej daale gaye
 According to information received from the RTI, 5400 trees are on paper and a six-member forest committee has been formed to protect these plants
 lekin jameen par na to itane paudhe dikhe or na hi in samitiyon ke logon ko kabhi gaanv waalon ne paudhe bachaate dekha
 The district of Mahoba is about sixty km from Banda
 is saal yahaan 14 lakh 60 hajaar paudhe lagaae gaye hai
 The Uttar Pradesh government had to plant 22 crore saplings in a single day, so 26 different departments were also entrusted with the responsibility of planting saplings
 upi parivahan vibhaag ke poudharopan ko dekhne ham mahoba ki bas stand pahunche
 The plants have been missing since the plantation was photographed here, and now the empty space is being used as peak donation
 isi mahoba ke gandhi upavan main khud van mantri daara singh ne poudharopan karavaaya tha
 To know his condition, we turned to Gandhi Park
 kaaphi poochne ke baad hi shahar se baahar ke is pahari par pahunche
 The Forest Department has planted around 6 thousand saplings of Gandhiji's favorite here
 lekin pataa chalaa ki mantri ji kaa lagaaya gaya bada paudha jinda he baaki ke kai paudhe hamen sookhe mili
 The plants left due to the stray cattle roaming here can only be called lucky
 bundelkhand ke saamaajik kaaryakarta ashish sagar bataate hai ki CAG ne bhi 2010 main hue poudharopan par jaanch kii baat kahi he lekin beete das saalon se jamini paudhon kii jaanch nahin ho pai he
 In fact, all the emphasis of the government is on plantation because it gives the opportunity to the politicians to propagate and the officials to do corruption, but when the emphasis is on saving the plant instead of planting, the synonym will also be saved

 Opposition to Chidambaram's petition cbi's response to the petition challenging Chidambaram's remand The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed its reply to the petition challenging the four-day remand of former home minister p Chidambaram in the INX Media case
 supreme court main sibiai ne chidambaram kii yachika kaa virodh kiya
 The Supreme Court will hear this matter at 2 pm today
 sibiai ne kaha ki chidambaram kii yachika sunwaayee yogya nahin he

 On Monday, Chidambaram got some relief from the Supreme Court in the INX Media case
 supreme court main somvaar ko hui sibiai castady ke khilaaf sunwaayee par adaalat ne pi
 Chidambaram has been asked to appeal to the lower court

 If it happens that p

 Actually, according to the Lieutenant Governor and the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Department of Delhi Services is still a reserved subject

 jise maanav samaaj ne hazaron saal main nadiyon ke kinare hasil kiya tha
 Sailing in Ganga for 28 years
 pehle chappu se naav chalaata tha ab motor se
 The water in the Ganges has also reduced, due to which the big ship does not run, but people have become less (more) less than the water
 ab vaise log bhi nahin chalate
 By the way people? Yes, Dada is mostly poor people
 dakshineshwar se belur ke liye das rupaya hi haada he
 Because those who walk are poor

 Used to bathe on the banks of the ghat

 Hundreds of stairs and descending gates to the river arrow

 Now these ghats are in a dilapidated state

 Poor boys have stopped dipping to remove coins thrown into the Ganges from the modern designed Vidyasagar bridge

 The Ganges bridge between Belur Math and Dakshineswar is quite wide
 nadi ke donon taraf kuch puraane mandir nazar aae jo kabhi samrudh rahe honge magar ab jarjar ho gaye hai
 There is a Radha Krishna temple on the side of Belur
 kaaphi bhavy campus laga or mandir kii banaavat bhi lekin ronaq utar gai he
 The temple of twelve Shiva appeared on the side of Dakshineswar
 bengal chat (palki kii chat jaisi) style main bana ek-ek mandir khoosaburat he, lekin koi halchal nazar nahin ai
 The color has descended and perhaps that generation of devotees who have been praying here may have disappeared

 The simplicity and grandeur of Belur Math and Dakshineswar Temple have not declined

 While leaving from Dakshineswar towards Belur, thousands of people who came there started staring

 purv sieji adhyaksh ne kaha, 'dekhie, pradhanmantri kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvurna hoti he or har bade kadam main aakhri faisla unka hota he
 Manmohan Singh made this decision in some cases and not in some
 ' unhone kaha, 'main aapako abhi bataa nahin saktaa ki kaise kitaab main maine in chizon kaa lekha-jokha pesh kiya he, lekin yah saaf he ki jin logon ko sahi vakt par sahi faisle lene the, unhone aisa nahin kiya

 lekin unhone kaha ki apni kitaab main unhone vistaar se likhaa he ki kin halaat main kaise-kaise un par dabaav daalaa gaya or kya-kya kaha gaya
 Former IAS Vinod Rai said that my colleague Bureaucrats were also sent to me for this work
 raay ne bataaya ki unhone sabase zyada pressure tab mahasoos kiya, jab sansad kii public acount kamity kii baithken chal rahi thi
 Rai's book will have 15 chapters, which will also mention his talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and important UPA officials

 Demanding the minimum allowance set by the government for servants in Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party said here on Wednesday that the state government is making a cruel joke with these servants and they are being given less than a third of the prescribed allowance

 He was received by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi
 imran khan ne kaha ki saudi arab or yuai sahit puri duniya ko kashmir par liye gaye faisle ko palatney ke liye bharat se anurodh karne main bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 a statement issued from Imran Khan's office said that the two countries would cooperate to help address the current challenges, reduce tensions and promote an environment of peace and security
 donon mantri videsh karyaalay bhi gaye or unhone kuraishi ke saath ek vistrut baithak kii, jinhone unhen kashmir kii taaja sthiti ke bare main unhen jaankaree di

 Saudi Arabia is a close ally of Pakistan struggling with economic crisis and Riyadh provided billions of dollars in aid to Islamabad

 Election bugle has been played in five states of the country
 vaise to ye sabhi rajya hindi bhashi nahin hai or yahaan bijepi ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 But the party wants to achieve a lot
 apni dhamak hindi bhashi rajyon ke saath-saath duusare rajyon main bhi darj karana chaahati he
 Simply put, this is a semi-final match for the BJP in the elections before the final matches in UP and Punjab
 daanv par piem kii karishmai chhavichaar rajyon pashchim bengal, assam, tamilnadu, kerala or centre shasit pradesh pudducheri main rashtriya raajnneeti kaa prabhaav kam he, yaa yun kahen ki dilli kii raajnneeti kaa asar kam he
 The regional leaders here are popular with the public
 or chunavi mudde bhi bilkul alag hote hai
 In such a situation, the path is not easy for the BJP, the biggest challenge for the BJP in these states is that there is no big face in the party from which to place bets, especially in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 And those who compete are big faces
 loksabhaa chunaav main badi jeet ke baad se hi bijepi rajya main hue chunaavon main bhi piem modi kaa cheharaa aage rakhkar chunavi ladaai ladi or dilli, bihar ko chhodkar sabhi rajyon main ummid se badhkar kamyaabi mili, bijepi is chunaav piem modi kaa cheharaa daanv par lagane se gharbai rahi he
 Because if these states do not get better results, then it will directly affect the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
 isaki badi vajah ye he ki dilli or bihar kii karaari haar ko bijepi bhuuli nahin he, yahaan bhi piem modi kii karishmai chhavi daanv par thi
 Questions were beginning to arise that now is the magic of Narendra Modi not affecting the people? Questions also arise, and now the elections of these five states are no less of an ordeal for PM Modi
 yani daanv par bijepi hi nahin, balki piem kii saakh bhi he
 Not against 'lehar', 'janadhar' elections are to be held in five states, where BJP is very weak at the ground level
 bijepi ne apni maujuudagi to in rajyon ke logon to pahunchaai he, lekin keval usee ke bal par chunavi naiya paar nahin lag sakati
 And then the possibility of alliance with any strong regional party is not visible at the moment
 pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee kii party ne akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan bhi kar diya he to vam dalon ke saath gathbandhan sambhav nahin
 Here the contest is between the TMC and the Left, but the BJP has given its full strength to make the contest triangular
 khud party adhyaksh amit shah morcha sanbhale hue hai or chunavi ranneeti ko anjaam dene main jute hai
 The bjp's new bet in Mamta's fort is that the BJP has fielded Netaji Subhash Chandra's great-grandson Chandra Kumar Bose against Mamta
 bijepi ne hunkaar bhari di he ki mamata banerjee ke khilaaf chandra kumaar bose chunaav ladenge
 Mamta is an MLA from Bhawanipur seat
 iske alaava centre sarkaar ne elaan kiya he ki netaji subhash chandra bose se sambandhit 25 gupt or filein sansad ke chaalu bajet satr ke baad jari kii jaaengin
 Earlier, in January, the government released 100 files containing 16,600 pages of historical documents
 iske peeche centre sarkaar kaa tark he ki log netaji ke jivan ko gaharaai se jaananaa chaahate hai
 But on this pretext, BJP wants to register its presence in West Bengal elections
 mamata kii chhavi badi chunautivaise to bijepi apni ranneeti ko raajnneetik rup dene main loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se hi juty he or nishane par mamata banerjee hai
 At the same time, many ministers of TMC were accused of corruption from Saradha scam to others, some even had to face jail
 lekin mamata kii khud kii chhavi ab tak bedaag hai
 Mamta did not ignore the slogan of Maa, Mati and Manusha even during the government
 singur se tata naino kaa plant hatwane ko lekar mamata kii aalochana hui thi, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad bhi mamata ne kabhi ye ahsaas nahin hone diya ki unke ruukh main puunjipatiyon or udyogpatiyon ko lekar koi badlaav aayaa he
 Mamta's stakes are heavy on the opposition and her popularity among the public remains
 modi or mamata kaa funda ek samanmamta keval pashchim bengal kii janata kii hit kii baat karti hai taaki janata se conection tut naa sake
 As if being the CM of Gujarat, Narendra Modi used to talk only about 6 crore Gujaratis
 vaise to mamata ne pichley chunaav main hi left partiyon ko satta se bedakhal kar apana raajnneetik agenda jaahir kar diya tha
 But after the bjp's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections, Mamat started to save her fort, she knew that the next target of BJP would be to weaken Mamata in West Bengal
 or isaki baangi pashchim bengal main hue kuch sampradayik dangon ke dauraan bijepi or tiemasi netaaon ke bich jubaani jang main dekhne ko mili
 The BJP is hesitant to put PM Modi's face at stake here
 kyonki yahaan ke chunaav parinaam kaa asar duusare rajyon ko bhi prabhavit karegaa
 But the party has no other option
 vipaksh bhi taak main he ki bijepi ne agar piem modi kaa cheharaa aage nahin kiya to is mudde ko tul denge ki ab modi kaa jaadu khatm ho gaya he or iskaa ahsaas bijepi ko bhi ho gaya he
 In Assam, the BJP seems to be a little active in the interesting contest, where the party has placed bets on Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal
 saath hi assam gana parishad ke saath gathbandhan bhi kiya he
 The objective of this alliance is to stop the division of anti-congress votes
 lekin bijepi ke andar hi is gathbandhan ke khilaaf aawaaj uth rahe hai
 The leaders of a section of the party, angry with this decision, have announced the formation of a new party
 or un sabhi 26 siton par chunaav ladane kaa elaan bhi kar diya he jo assam gana parishad ko di gai hai
 However, the BJP will benefit from the charisma within the ruling Congress more than the charismatic image of its leadership here
 lekin satta tak pahunchane ke liye ye kaaphi nahin he
 Recently, PM Modi had a meeting here
 jisamen unhone maujuuda congress sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha or apni uplabdhiyaan ginaayin
 With the help of promises, the BJP has made the contest here interesting
 ammaa, imoshan or gathjodtamilnadu main chunaav se purv congress or diemke ke bich gathbandhan sattarudh dal ke liye badi chunauti he
 CM Jayalalitha also knows that this alliance can create problems in her path
 yahaan kii janata bhaavnaatmak rup se netaaon se judi hoti hai
 Which BJP does not have
 bijepi ke paas aisa koi cheharaa nahin jo apane dam par yahaan hawa kii rukh ko apni ore mode sake
 Then here also the electoral issues are completely different than other states
 janata se sari, tivi, mobile jaisi chijen dene kaa vaada kiya jaataa he
 And this is also done after coming to power
 jayalalita sarkaar ne bhi chunavi vaadon ko pramukhataa se lagu kiya
 Simply put, Tamil Nadu politics is based around Tamil issues
 abhinayta se netaa bane vijayakaanth kii party dmdike ne bhi akele vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar romaanch paidaa kar diya he
 The DMDK was a part of the NDA in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin akele chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar party ne bijepi ko jor kaa jhatka diya he
 The BJP was expecting the alliance to continue
 is bich bijepi ke liye raahat kii ye khabar he ki yahaan mulabla ab ediemke, diemke-congress gathbandhan, bijepi, peeddabluef or dmdike ke bich hone vaala he
 That is, if the votes are divided then BJP will get benefit
 tamilnadu se bijepi ko asaloksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko tamilnadu main ek seat par safalataa mili thi
 Also, there was an increase in the vote percentage, but it cannot be called a hold of the party
 bijepi centre kii nitiyon ke saath apni jaden yahaan failana chaahati he
 But the lack of the same face puts the party on the backfoot
 centre sarkaar tamil kii hit kii baat karti to he ki lekin use votaron main vishwaas main jagaanaa hoga
 Although the BJP has nothing to lose here, but the face of PM Modi is definitely at stake in the desire to gain
 tamilnadu bada rajya he or muqabla bhi bada he
 Regionally, there is a lack of both condition and direction for the BJP
 keval ummid ke bal par bijepi dam bhar rahi he
 In such a situation, what effect Modi's charismatic magic has on Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi's emotional voters will be clear only on May 19
 unki khamiyaan, apni taqatkerala or pudducheri main bhi bijepi apni maujuudagi darj karana chaahati he, isi kram main kerala main bijepi ne pichley dinon bhartiya dharm jan sena(bdjs) jaisi kshetreey party se gathbandhan kiya
 At the same time, opposition has gathered to give the electoral color to the solar scam on Oman Chandy government
 is ghotaale kii aanch ne oman chandi ke parivaar ko bhi lapete main le liya he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had made the contest on Thiruvananthapuram seat exciting
 jeet to nahin mili thi lekin apni maujuudagi jarur darj kara di thi
 Now BJP wants to overcome the shortage in the Lok Sabha elections
 party ko lagata he ki thodi takat lagaaya jaae to apni takat dakshin bharat main bhi badhaai ja sakati he
 If the bjp's bet on PM Modi worked here, then the party's path ahead will become a little easier
 saath hi piem modi kaa karishmai cheharaa upi or punjab chunaav main party kii jeet ko or sunishchit kar degaa
 But if BJP does not get the expected success in these five, then it will make the path ahead for the party and PM Modi more challenging

 According to information received from the sources, the Ministry of Home Affairs has selected the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Railway Protection Force (RPF), Assam Rifles (AR), Delhi Police and BSF Camel for the content of only 5 Central Armed Police Forces as desired by the Ministry of Defense
 The name of the contingent has been sent for this time's parade

 Former paramilitary organization general secretary Ranvir Singh has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi protesting in this regard, requesting that all central armed forces should be inducted on the occasion of Republic Day parade

 It is noteworthy that in the nearly 1,000 battalions of central paramilitary forces, about 10,00,000 personnel have been carrying out internal security and many other important security obligations besides protecting the borders of the country, which has given these forces a lot of recognition in the last few decades
 And there has also been a demand to provide facilities at par with the army
 is par raksha mantralay kii daleel he ki rajpath par samay zyada lagane ke kaaran contigents kii sankhya ko simit rakhaa ja rahaa he jabaki purv paramilitary associesans kaa kahana he ki yadi yahaan chaar-paanch atirikt contigent march bhi karen to bamushkil se 2 se 3 minute kaa atirikt samay hi lagegaa jise amal main laane main koi pareshaani nahin hogi, lekin jaanboojhkar ardhsainik balon ko is parade se vanchit rakhaa ja rahaa he jo kendriya ardhsainik balon ke saath sautele vyavhaar kaa parichaayak he
 According to him, the time has come for the Center to recognize these security forces on the lines of the Armed Forces and give the same respect to their personnel that their army brothers have been receiving

 The electoral process has begun for the 17th Lok Sabha and the first phase of voting has also been completed
 desh main bane chunavi maahaul ke dekhte hue yah jaananaa behad jaruri ho jaataa he ki pichhali baar sansad main chunakar aae saansadon kaa vyaktigat str par sadan main pradarshan kaisaa rahaa he
 Which mps performed extremely well in the 16th Lok Sabha and which MP disappointed their voters
 yahaan tak ki kis saansad ne kadaa parishram kiya
 To answer all these questions, the Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today Group prepared a blueprint and compared the performance of the legislative functions of the previous Lok Sabha mps
 har saansadon ke pradarshan ko 3 paramitaron (sansad main pradarshan, MPLADS ke tahat saansadon kaa vyay or sambandhit sansadeey kshetra main kaam ko lekar logon kii raay) par parkhaa gaya
 For this, the Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today Group prepared 416 mps out of 543 elected Lok Sabha mps
 yahaan hamane un saansadon ko chunaa jinhone 18 may, 2014 se apane sansadeey kaarykaal kii shuruyaat kii
 However, the list does not include Union Minister, Lok Sabha Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Leader of the Opposition in the House as they do not have to sign the attendance register for attendance
 is tarah se sansad main unke kaary kii purna jaankaree uplabdh ho sakati
 Public opinion could not be found in 9 parliamentary constituencies
 kaise taiyaar karen apane saansad kaa report cardsbase pehle apane saansad yaa sansadeey kshetra ko search karnaa hoga
 If they are not named in this list, then your MP has not got ranking

 For parliamentary performance, mps were ranked on 3 counts of attendance in the house (25 per cent of the total score), number of questions asked in the house (20 per cent) and number of private bills introduced in the house (15 per cent)
 haalanki yahaan yah gaur karne vaali baat he ki sadan main sawaal poochne or nijee bill pesh ko sadan sarvocch pradarshan kaa aadhaar nahin mana ja saktaa
 This figure is taken from PRS Legislative Research
 MPLADS ke moolyankan ke liye hamane vaastavik kharch par gaur kiya
 Under the scheme, Lok Sabha mps are given 25 crores in 5 years at the rate of 5 crores per year to spend on welfare schemes in their parliamentary constituencies
 is sambandh main saansadon kii ore se kiya gaya kharch kul score kaa 30 fisadi aata he
 It is also to be noted here that the MP can give only instructions for expenditure under MPLADS, while the responsibility of the district administration is to complete it
 is sambandh main 8 april, 2019 ko MPLADS kii webside par uplabdh aankada liya gaya he
 Public opinion about mps is based on the report on All India Survey on Governance Issues and Voting Behavior, 2018
 vyapak str par kiye gaye is survey main 2
 7 lakh people were included
 yah survey association of democratic riforms (ediaar) ne 2018 main desh ke sansadeey kshetron se karaayaa tha
 The survey tried to know about the performance of the government on 3 important issues (such as unemployment and pure drinking water)
 ye mudde har sansadeey kshetra ke lihaaj se alag-alag rahe
 India Today averaged the performance of mps on the basis of public opinion to raise 3 major issues, which was considered 10 percent in the overall mps ranking
 haalanki voters kii raay sarkaar ke pradarshan par aadhaarit thi na kii saansadon ke pradarshan par
 However, it was easy to find out what the mps' opinion of the government was in the parliamentary constituency
 isiilie overol score taiyaar karne ke liye is vikalp se sabase kam number die gaye
 India Today included the same parties with at least 10 mps in the House to prepare a report on the performance of mps on the basis of party
 is maamle main mahaj 7 partiyaan hi shaamil ho sakin jisamen shivasena ko sabase zyada number (A+) mili jabaki ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (AIADMK) or bijepi ko a grad mila
