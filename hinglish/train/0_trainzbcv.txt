 Another example of growing proximity between BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha and RJD is seen when Shatrughan Sinha exhorted the BJP and JDU in Bihar to start working for the development of the state or else RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav would take responsibility
 Are now ready for shatrughna sinha ne twit karte huetejasvi yadavaki tulana mahabharat ke arjuna se kii or kaha ki agar aane vaale dinon main bijepi or jediu kii sarkaar ne bihar main logon ke liye kaam karnaa shuru nahin kiya to arjuna ke rup main tejasvi yadav ab pradesh kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar hai

 Shatrughan Sinha said that the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are now near and before that in the name of granting special state status to Bihar, leaders are shedding crocodile tears and gimmicky
 bijepi or jediu par tanj kasate hue shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki chunaavon se pehle bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye maang uth rahi he or dilachasp baat yah he ki yah maang centre ki satta main baithe unheen ke party ke logon se kii ja rahi he
 In the field of politics, Bihar has been different from the beginning and Bihar is perhaps the only state where politics takes place in the name of Bhoja
 makar sankranti ke maukey par bhi rajya ke vibhinn raajnneetik dalon dwaara chuda-dahi bhoj kaa aayojan kiya gaya he, parantu isamen bhi dalon kii apni raajnneeti najar aa rahi he
 By the way, organizing banquet by political parties on the occasion of Makar Sankranti is not new
 bihar janata dal (united) ne makar sankranti ke maukey par chuda-dahi bhoj kaa aayojan kiya he
 Earlier, leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also participated in this event with full enthusiasm, but this time the circumstances have changed
 pichley saal jediu or bhaajapa ek-duusare se alag ho gaye or donon party ke netaaon main talkhi bhi badi he
 BJP leaders have also been invited to the banquet, says Vashistha Narayan Singh, president of jdu's Bihar unit
 yah koi raajnneeti kaa manch nahin he, yah to khaane-pine kaa aayojan he
 However, BJP leaders are scared of the invitation to the banquet
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or rajya ke purv mantri giriraaj singh kehete hai, jediu kii to puraani aadat he 'nyotaa dekar bije gol' karnaa
 In such a situation, he is afraid of his invitation
 vah kehete hai ki ek baar pehle bhi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi sahit bhaajapa ke netaaon ko bhoj par aamantrit kiya gaya tha, lekin baad main ise radd kar diya gaya tha
 He says that all the leaders of the JDU have been given the color of Nitish, so they are afraid to go to the banquet
 idhar, rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ne bhi makar sankranti ke maukey par chuda-dahi bhoj kaa aayojan kiya he
 Invitations have been sent to all RJD leaders and intelligent citizens in this banquet
 argedy ke adhyaksh lalu prasad is bhoj ko lekar khud taiyaari main jute hue hai
 Lalu says that if we go to someone's house on this day, then it costs them, that is why here we will talk together
 argedy ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki is din argedy ke netaa party kii aage kii ranneeti par bhi vichaar karenge
 By the way, Lalu says philosophically, the country is threatened by communal forces, there is a need to save the country
 jab desh rahegaa tab hi raajnneeti hogi
 However, political parties are busy in the banquet event on Makar Sankranti, but in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, further strategies are also being made during the banquet
 manyata he ki makar sankranti parv ke baad se shubh samay kaa aagaman hota he or sankranti ke din chuda-gud or tilkut se munh meetha karne se aage kaam shubh hote hai

 pathak congress sevadal ko purv kaaryakarta bataaya jaataa he
 However, Kejriwal later forgiven her

 On the question of Hazare's associates Rajagopal and Rajendra Singh's separation from Team Anna, Kejriwal said that he was not aware of the actual developments
 is mudde par baad main charchaa kii jaaegi
 Kejriwal said that Team Anna has appealed to him not to vote in order to press for the passage of Jan Lokpal Bill and its other implications should not be removed

 2015 cricket world cap main mangalvaar se shuru ho rahaa he semifinal muqabla or isamen do badi timen bhidane ke liye taiyaar hai
 This mahamukabala will be played between hosts New Zealand vs South Africa in Auckland
 quarter final main jahaan newjiland ne martin guptil kii aitihaasik naabad 237 ranon kii madad se westeindies ko nock out kiya vahiin dakshin africa ne srilanka ko 9 wicket se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa kuch had tak ‚Äòchokars‚Äô kaa tag hataane kii koshish kii
 Both teams performed at the 2015 World Cup, New Zealand's most successful captain Stephen Fleming in the day, described Guptill's innings as the greatest innings in New Zealand cricket history
 guptidapani is pari kii badaulat ab is toornament ke semifinal main pahunchi tiimon ke cricketrs ke bich sabase adhik ran (498) banane vaale ballebaaj (overol main sangakaara ke baad number-2) ban gaye hai
 Captain Brendon mccullum's bat has also been thundering in the tournament
 vahiin kiwi gendbaaj bhi is toornament main shuru se hi chhaae hue hai
 Due to the bowlers' brilliant performance, the Kiwi team took 67 wickets in the seven matches played, the highest wicket-taker in this tournament after India
 kul milakar is toornament main lagaataar saat match jeet chuki newjiland team ke lagbhag sabhi khilaadi form main laut aae hai
 On the other hand South Africa have lost two matches in the tournament but their captain d'villiers (417 runs), Hashim Amla (323 runs) and du-plessis (298 runs) are in excellent form
 unke paas del sten or morne morkel jaise gendbaaj hai jinaki gendbaaji bade se bade ballebaajon ke liye pehle bhi musiibat ban chuki he
 That is, they can destroy any batting order
 nzvssa: aankade kya bolte hai?world cap main in donon tiimon ke bich ab tak kul chah mukaable hue hai
 Of this, New Zealand has won four while the African team has won two
 lekin baat agar vanade cricket kii karen to yahaan sher dakshin africa he
 There have been a total of 61 odis between the two teams
 inamen se 36 dakshin africa jeeta he to keval 20 newjiland ke khate main aayaa
 Out of the three matches between these two teams in 2014, the South African team won two matches while one was canceled due to rain
 yani kul milakar aankadon kii najar main palada dakshin africa team kaa hi baari lagata he
 The South African team's performance in the World Cup semi-finals is a well known choker tag, but i want to put New Zealand in the same category here as they are bigger chokers than Africa as well
 jahaan dakshin africa team world cap ke semifinal main teen baar pahunch kar baahar ho chuki he vahiin newjiland unase thik dogune chah baar aisa kar chuki he
 The African team lost to England in 1992, then to 1999 and 2007 to champions Australia
 udhar newjiland kii team 1975 se ab tak chah baar semifinal main pahunchi lekin final kabhi nahin khel saki
 This is New Zealand's third consecutive World Cup and the seventh semifinal (2007, 2011 and 2015) at the World Cup after 1975, 1979, 1992 and 1996
 newjiland kii team 1975 main champion westeindies se, 1979 main england se, 1992 main champion pakistan se, 1999 main ek baar phir pakistan se, 2007 main srilanka se or 2011 main australia se haar kar toornament ke semifinal mukaable se baahar ho chuki he
 One of the reasons that makes cricket special is the uncertainty of the nature of the match
 matlab yah he ki match vaale din timen kaisaa khel rahi hai yah jeet ke liye sabase zyada myne rakhata he na ki khel rahi tiimon ke bich pehle kya aankade rahe hai
 New Zealand coach Mike Hewson also agrees
 hesan ne kaha, ‚Äòham sabhi final main jagah banane ke liye utsuk hai or mujhe lagata he ki semifinal kaa yah muqabla behad romaanchak hoga
 Both teams are playing good cricket and it will be a tough match
 ‚Äô newjiland ke liye ekmaatr chintaa edi kii chot ke kaaran tej gendbaaj adam milne kaa baahar hona he
 He has been replaced by young fast bowler Matt Henry
 maujuuda world cap main newjiland kii mejabani main hone vaala yah antim match hoga, team jeet ke saath hi padosi mulk australia main pehali baar final khilne janaa chaahegi lekin apane gharelu darshakon kii maujuudagi main team par ek alag dabaav bhi maujuud hoga
 New Zealand's track record suggests that he was never considered a strong contender but the team playing with him has also been playing with 'chokers' and this tag would remain unchanged if he could not win this time as well
 match kaa vijeta koun hoga yah anumaan laga paanaa behad mushkil he
 But it is expected that the thrill will be at its peak in this match between the two teams
 to bas kuch hi der main ho jayega faisla ki in do bade ‚Äòchokars‚Äô ke is mukaable kaa vijeta ban kar pehali baar final main koun pahonchega

 agar vartmaan shiksha uttari dhruv he to madrasa shiksha dakshini dhruv jisamen koi saamanjasy nahin he
 Write in the letter - Terrorist organizations do madrasas
 Funding youth educated in madrasas are unproductive on employment front
 unki digriyaan sabhi jagah maanya nahin hoti or khaskar nijee kshetra main jo rojgaar he vahaan madrasa shiksha kii koi bhoomika nahin hoti
 In such a situation, the whole community becomes harmful to the society
 zyaadaatar madrase jakaat ke paise se chal rahe hai jo ki bharat, bangladesh or pakistan jaise deshon se aa rahe hai
 Some terrorist organizations are also funding illegally running madrasas
 is report main yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki muslim ilaakon main zyaadaatar madrase saudi arab ke bheje dhan se chal rahe hai
 It should be investigated
 pradhanmantri ko likhi chitthee main murshidaabad or shamali ke madrason kaa bhi zikr he
 Here, there has been talk of sending terrorist and ammunition from one place to another
 shiya central vakf board ne apni is report main uniform ajukeshan system kii vakaalat kii he taaki sabhi logon ko ek jaisi shiksha mil sake

 naidu ne kaha ki jab aap rajyapal ko patr likh rahe hai, kisi ko un par nihit swaarth se kaary karne kaa aarope nahin lagaana chahie
 He is behaving very impartially and discharging his duties
 siem kii post khaali nahinunhone kaha ki mukhyamantri kaa koi pad hi khaali nahin he jise bharaa janaa he kyonki pehle se hi ek sarkaar he jiskaa netritv ek mukhyamantri kar rahe hai
 Naidu said that the fact that Kipneerselvam was elected chief minister even during Madam (jayalalithaa)
 tatpashchaat annadramuk netaaon ne swayan unhen mukhyamantri banaaya
 He said that i have no plea to explain on his behalf, Naidu also made it clear that the BJP does not have any member in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and there is no possibility for the party to form a government there
 unhone kaha, ham koi aadhaar taiyaar nahin kar rahe hai ki yah unka aantarik maamla he
 There is no pressure on Sasikala vs
 Panneerselvamarvivar to present all the mlas of Sasikala to the media and claim that she is free
 vahiin tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri o
 Panneerselvam says that Sasikala should leave all the mlas instead of shedding crocodile tears
 panniraselvamane kaha ki bahut se vidhayakon ne mujhase sampark kiya he, unka kahana he ki ek vidhayak ke upar 4 gunde najar rakh rahe hai
 He is being closely monitored
 vahiin unhen resort se bhi baahar nahin aane diya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Panneerselvam said on the question of using the police to get rid of the mlas that such a decision can create any bad situation

 goa main sabhi dharm par ek samaan lagu hota he portugali civil kodegova main court kii ijaajat se hi muslim de sakate hai talaksupreme court ne ek baar phir se desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke liye uniform civil code banane kii baat kahi he
 At the same time, Goa has been highly praised for implementing the Portuguese Civil Code
 portugali civil code goa ke sabhi dharm ke logon par samaan rup se lagu hota he
 The Supreme Court made this remark on Friday in a judgment in Jos√© Paulo Coutinho v
 Maria Luiza Valentin Pereira
 supreme court ne kaha ki desh ke sabhi nagarikon ke liye ek uniform civil code banane kii abhi tak koi koshish nahin kii gai
 The Supreme Court said that we ourselves had asked for the Uniform Civil Code, but so far no steps have been taken in this direction
 justise deepak gupta or aniruddh bose kii peeth ne apane faisle main kaha ki bharat main goa rajya uniform civil code ko lekar sining igjampal he
 In the state of Goa, the Portuguese Civil Code is equally applicable to people of all religions
 supreme court ne kaha ki goa main portugali civil code 1867 lagu he, jiske tahat uttaradhikaar nirdhaarit hota he
 The property rights of those who live in any corner of India outside Goa are also determined under the Portuguese Civil Code, who are residents of Goa
 bina court kii ijaajat ke goa main muslim nahin de sakate talaakais dauraan supreme court ne goa civil code ke praavdhaanon kii bhi tarif kii, jiske tahat shaadi ke pehle or shaadi ke baad pati or patni ko sampatti main samaan adhikaar diya jaataa he
 In Goa, Muslims are not allowed to divorce by polygamy and speaking
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki koi bhi musalmaan apni patni ko khud talaak nahin de saktaa he
 If he has to divorce his wife, he has to go to court
 sirf court ke aadesh par hi talaak hota he
 There are different laws in other parts of the country, in other parts of the country, other Acts have been enacted, including the Indian Succession Act or Hindu Law, Hindu Succession Act, Muslim Personal Law (sharia) Application Act, to give rights over property
 iske chalate dharm ke aadhaar par logon ke adhikaar or daayitv alag-alag hai
 The Supreme Court said that the interesting thing is that the Constitution makers have stated the Uniform Civil Code in Article 44

 archer ne ski sports se kaha, 'main viraat ko out karnaa chaahunga, kyonki ipel main main unka wicket nahin le paaya tha
 i think his wicket was taken by the leg-spinner in most matches
 main abi divilliars ke khilaaf bhi gendbaaji karnaa chaahunga, lekin ab vah dakshin africa ke liye nahin khelte he
 He said, 'I would also like to take Chris Gayle's wicket
 ' unhone kaha ki ipel main khilne se unhen vishwa cap kii taiyaari karne main madad mili
 Archer said, 'I think i will benefit a lot compared to the other players in our team

 ' In Canada, an 18-year-old girl has been sentenced to 6 and a half years in prison on charges of racketeering cosex

 On the issue of supporting Advani and the BJP, Hindu organizations in Gujarat seem to be torn apart
 jahaan sangh parivaar kaa hissaa maane jane vaali vishwa hindu parishad ne adwani ko samarthan dene kii baat kahi he vahiin sant samaaj khulkar unke kilaaf bol rahaa he
 Until recently, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad was also opposing the BJP in Gujarat, but due to political compulsion, VHP chief Ashok Singhal came to Gujarat and announced to support the BJP whole heartedly
 haalanki kabhi unke ek ishaare par chalane vaala sant samaaj, is masale par singhl ke saath nahin
 The saints say that Advani has taken a wavering attitude on the Ram temple issue, hence he is against them but Singhal is claiming the entire Sant Samaj to be with the BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav ke agsit pole ne desh main phir se modi sarkaar banane kaa anumaan lagaaya to share bazaar bhi uchhal padaa
 The Shiv Sena termed the stock market of Mumbai as a 'jadunagari' and said that such fun happens in our vast country
 ab bhi aisi masti hui
 Narendra Modi must have laughed on seeing him
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke teen sau paar kii bhavishyavaanee se share bazaar jarur kulaanche maarane laga he, magar isse garibon ko kya mil rahaa he
 
 
 Raising questions in the editorial of its mouthpiece 'saamana', the Shiv Sena has said - This belief of 'aayenge Modi Hi' filled the enthusiasm of the investors and also increased the share prices of many big companies
 isse mutthibhar logon ne milakar 5
 33 lakh crores
 share bazaar main jab teji kii lahar uth rahi thi, usee samay petrol or dijal kaa bhav badhane ke kaaran mahangaai kii teji uchhalane kaa bhay paidaa ho gaya he
 The price of Amul milk has also increased by two rupees
 matlab uchle share bazaar kaa laabh desh kii garib janata ko nahin miltaa
 There is a severe drought in Maharashtra
 or sarkaar yaachak ke rup main dilli kii dahalij par khadi he
 But what did the people who earned crores in yesterday's fast wave benefit for drought prevention
 shivasena ne saamana ke sampadakeey main nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he ki kuch logon ne bainkon ko dubaakar palaayan kiya to anek logon ne ‚Äòkamai‚Äô sahit khushi-khushi desh chhod diya
 This picture is not good
 desh main berogari kaa pahaad bad rahaa he
 Nevertheless, the youth and women voted overwhelmingly in support of Modi with a belief, which led to the rapid rise in the stock market
 bazaar main ai teji kii hawa nai sarkaar kii aarthik sudhaar kii nitiyon par nirbhar hogi
 NDA is coming to power again
 arthvyavastha ko majbootee chahie
 Provision made in areas like agriculture, education, health and defense is important for this
 shivasena ne sampadakeey main kaha he ki jod-ghataav kii raajnneeti in dinon satta sthapit karne ke liye jari he
 The bottom line of this Shiv Sena editorial is that the exit poll has given a boost to the stock market and people have earned crores but nothing has changed for the common people, or it will also benefit the drought affected areas
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki amir or amir ho rahe hai or keemten bad rahi hai jo sidhe aam logon ko prabhavit karti hai
 In Saamna's editorial, it has been expressed at a high level expressing deep concern over unemployment
 saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ab sookhaa prabhavit kshetron, shiksha, swasthya or raksha par adhik dhyaan dene kaa suzav diya he

 tripura vidhansabha chunaav 2018 is baar sattarudh marxvaadi communist party (makapa), bhartiya janata party (bijopi) or congress ke liye kaaphi ahmiyat bhare hone ja rahe hai
 Although every seat is important for the three main parties, but one of these seats is such that where defeating the CPI (M) can prove to be crooked for both these main parties
 tripura vidhansabha seat sankhya-23 dhanpur tripura kaa ek chota sa ardh-shahari centre, jo rajdhani agartala se 65 kilometre pashchim main sthit he
 a total of 43,728 voters will vote this time in Dhanpur constituency bordering Bangladesh's Sipajhala district
 dhanpur vidhansabha kshetra main kul mahila matadaataaon kii sankhya 20,974 he, to vahiin 22,754 purush matadaata apane vidhayak ko chunane ke liye vot karte dikhaai denge
 The history of Dhanpur region is that since the first assembly elections held in 1972, the CPI-M has never lost
 1972 se 1993 tak lagaataar paanch vidhansabha chunaav makapa netaa samar choudhary ne jite the
 This region was established in the strongest forts of the CPI (M)
 congress ko ekatarfa maatiske alaava makapa netaaon ne is seat par har baar congress ko ekatarfa maat di
 In 1998, CPI (M) gave ticket to Manik Sarkar in place of Samar Chaudhary
 ummidavaar ke badalane se yahaan kii janata ne apana man nahin badla
 Alam is that after four consecutive elections Manik Sarkar won this seat by a huge vote
 20 saal se rajya ke mukhyamantri maanik sarkaarasattarudh makapa ne dhanpur vidhansabha kshetra se ek baar phir apane vartmaan mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar ko khadaa kiya he
 Manik Sarkar is the Chief Minister of the state for the last 20 years and has filed nomination for the fifth consecutive time from Dhanpur 
 desh ke sabase garib mukhyamantrimakapa ke kaddavar netaaon main se ek maanik sarkaar ko unki saaf suthri chhavi or desh ke sabase garib mukhyamantri ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 He filed his affidavit for the assembly elections on 29 January, in which he gave his personal information showing that he had only Rs 1520 cash, showed Rs 2410 in the bank account till 20 January
 maanik sarkaar tripura ke mukhyamantri hone ke saath hi makapa paulitte beuro ke sadsy bhi hai
 At the same time, BJP has fielded Tripura state unit general secretary Pratima Bhowmik against Manik Sarkar
 bhaumik isse pehle 1998 or 2003 main sarkaar ke khilaaf chunaav lard chuki he or unhen donon baar tisare sthaan se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 The BJP has tried its hand at geopolitical and changed the election to women versus men
 chunaavon ke maddenjar or purvottar rajyon main apni upasthiti darj karaane main juty bijepi ne tripura ke liye khaas 'chalo palatai' (badlaav laate hai) kaa naaraa diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Smriti Irani have campaigned this slogan very well during the election rallies in Dhanpur
 congress ne teen mahilaon ko diya tiktavahin purvottar main apni jameen talashne main juty congress ne is seat se lakshmi naag (burman) ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 The Congress has given tickets to three women in these elections, one of which is Lakshmi
 lakshmi purv congress sarkaar main mantri rah chuki he or rajya ikai par apni pakad rakhti hai
 Apart from this, the Trinamool Congress has fielded Zaheer Uddin from this much talked about seat
 mahila ummidavaaron kii chunautidhanpur vidhansabha par rajya ke mukhyamantri kii daavedaari ke bich congress or bijepi ne mahila ummidavaar par daanv aajamaaya he
 It will be interesting to see how far these two parties are able to make a dent in this impregnable fort of Manik Sarkar
 rajya main jahaan ek taraf pichley 25 saalon se satta par kabiz makapa he, to vahiin jeet ke rath par savaar bijepi bhi maidan main taal thok rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress is trying to save its shrinking existence through this election
 makapa ne 57 siton par kiye ummidavaar ghoshitchunaavon main makapa ne 57 siton par apane ummidavaar ghoshit kiye hai to vahiin bhaajapa ne 51 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye hai

 (input ieenes se) The Indian government has sought help from Herv Falsiani, who, a few days ago, while speaking to NDTV, said that India has only one percent of the information about black money deposited in Swiss and other foreign banks

 iske baad enditivi ne bhartiya adhikariyon tathaa harv failciyaani ke bich sampark karavaaya, or harv ne enditivi se yah bhi kaha ki vah zarurat padane par ek team ke saath bharat aa bhi saktaa he
 Earlier this month in an exclusive chat with NDTV, Herv, who was a system engineer at Geneva's HSBC Bank, said that in 2011, France had just one percent of the HSBC accounts it had shared with India
 harv kaa kahana tha ki bharat ko maatr do embi (megabite) jaankaree hi di gai thi, jabaki 200 jibi (gigabite) kaa data he
 He said that if India requests tomorrow, we will offer them immediately

 vaise, supreme court ne purv jajon tathaa sevanivrutt naukarshahon kii ek team banaai he, jo kaala dhan waapas laane kaa rasta sujhaayegi
 It is believed that on Monday this Special Investigation Team (SIT) will tell the Supreme Court that the tax assessment of 100 HSBC Geneva account holders has been completed, and a total tax of Rs 1,000 crore is levied on them

 gahalot ne kaha 'koun banegaa karodpati main pehle se pataa chalata he ki karodpati koun banane vaala he

In response to this, the Congress General Secretary of the organization said, "who knows in advance who is going to become a millionaire?" Sachin Pilot, sitting on the stage, also laughed at Gehlot's reply

 Demonetisation has been completed for a year today
 pichley ek saal main ye mudda raajnneeti kaa sabase bada mudda ubhar kar aayaa
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it, his protest started all over the country since then
 lekin kuch logon ne is faisle kaa khulkar swaagat kiya tha
 Many celebrities were also involved in these
 lekin abhinayta se netaa bane south superstar camel hasan ne haal hi main notebandi kaa samarthan karne ke liye maafee maangi thi
 Haasan had said that he had hastily supported demonetisation, but now he apologizes for it
 hasan ne ek tamil megsine main lekh likhaa tha, jiskaa sheershak hi 'a big apollogy' tha
 What Haasan said during demonetisation? When Haasan was announced last year, Kamal Haasan was one of the celebrities who openly supported demonetisation
 tab camel ne likhaa tha, mistar modi ko sailyut he, notebandi ko party line se uthakar saport karnaa chahie
 This is a big step for tax payers
 ab kahaan maari palatilekin ek saal baad camel hasan ne lekh main likhaa, mere kai saathiyon ne mere samarthan ke dene ke baad mujhe iske bare main samajhaayaa
 After which i realized that even though the plan was good, it was not implemented properly
 PM bhi maangen maaficamel ne likhaa ki agar piem modi is galati ke liye maafee maangane ko taiyaar hai, to main unhen ek or baar salaam karuunga
 The identity of a good leader is to acknowledge his mistakes

 Kairana and Nurpur separated Samajwadi Party and RLD at the end of the by-election
 sutron kii maane to areldi or samaajawaadee party ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar samjhauta ho gaya he or upachunaav main seat bhi bant gai he
 When Jayant Chaudhary came to his house to meet Akhilesh Yadav, there was speculation that there was going to be an agreement between the two in this by-election, RLD was seeking Kairana seat for Jayant Chaudhary, but Samajwadi Party Had announced that it would give its candidate not only in Kairana but also in Noorpur
 areldi ne kairana seat par choda daawine donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan lagbhag tut ke kagaar par tha, lekin donon ne apane hit main aakhirkaar faisla liya or sutron ke mutabik donon ek-ek seat kaa bantwaaraa kar liya
 When the RLD relinquished its claim to the Kairana parliamentary seat, the Samajwadi Party gave up the Nurpur assembly seat for the RLD
 haalanki donon ne abhi apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he, lekin siton kii daavedaari tay kar di he
 The embarrassing situation for the Congress has alienated the Congress today because the Congress had announced its support for the RLD candidate in Kairana, now the RLD has left Kairana itself for the SP, so for the Congress Things have become embarrassing
 ab congress ke liye sapa ko samarthan dene ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa
 It remains to be seen what the Congress decides
 mayawati ke ishaare par hui akhilesh-jayant kii mulakatmayawati ne kairana main chunaav na ladane kii baat pehle kah di thi, saath hi kisi ko samarthan nahin karne kii bhi baat kahi he
 Despite its insiders, Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary have met only after the bsp's approval and Mayawati is believed to be indirect support

 Ratlam Puri, nephew of CM Kamal Nath, has been dismissed by the High Court from the High Court
 The court rejected his anticipatory bail plea
 court ne agasta westland cese main unki agrim jamaanat yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The court heard the petition on Tuesday in which the application for anticipatory bail was made and the arrest was stayed till date
 ratul puri kii taraf se pesh hue abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki mere client ko bank dhokhadhadi se jude duusare cese main giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 He said that it is very interesting that the investigating agency registered a case 48 hours ago and also arrested Ratul Puri
 unhone kaha ki jab wo poochtacha ke liye idi ke daftar gaye the
 He was summoned for questioning in another case and was arrested in another case
 eesg aman lekhi ne kaha ki ratul mani londring se jude maamle main aaropee hai or ek cese ke taar duusare cese se jude hue hai

 unhone kaha ki hamen andeshaa he ki ratul puri ke paas kareeb 300 se 400 karod rupee kii benami sampatti yaa phir mani londring se kamai gai rakam he

 court ke aadesh ke baad ratul puri agency ke saamne poochtacha ke liye pesh hue
 Now how can we trust a person who is running away from the investigating agency and appearing before the ED after a strict court order? bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain sunil gavaskar kaa kahana he ki bharat ko agar srilanka ke khilaaf colombo main shuukravaar se shuru hone vaale tisare or antim test match 5 gendbaajon ke saath utarana chahie
 "stuart Binny should be dropped and five specialist bowlers should be kept in the playing XI," he said
 gavaskar ne kaha ki swing gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar ko team main rakhaa janaa chahie, kyonki team ko test jeetne ke liye 20 wicket lene kii jarurat he
 He said, 'this is a decisive Test and if you want to win, you have to take 20 wickets
 iske liye bharat ko paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko rakhana chahie
 If there is some grass left in the pitch as is the possibility, then i would like to put Bhubaneswar in the team because in such circumstances you need a swing bowler to take 20 wickets
 ' The former captain said, 'I fully respect Stuart, i believe that he is not a bowler taking five wickets in an innings
 usne duusare test main acchhee bhoomika nibhaai, lekin sateek gendbaaji nahin kar paaya
 There is likely to be some grass in the Sinhalese Sports Club pitch
 gavaskar ne is bare main enditivi se kaha, 'bhartiya spinneron ne srilankai ballebaajon ke khilaaf bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 Among his spinners, only Rangana Herath did well in the first Test
 ' tippaniyan India will field two new players due to injuries to Murali Vijay and Wriddhiman Saha, but Gavaskar believes Sri Lanka's situation is worse than the Indian team, as they will miss Kumar Sangakkara
 unhone kaha, 'sangakaara bahut bada khilaadi tha or unki jagah bharne ke liye koi acha vikalp nahin he
 Although he did not do well in the series, he would miss his presence in the team and the dressing room
 srilankai team main anubhav kii kami he or angelo maithyuj ko chhodkar uske adhiktar khilaadiyon ne bahut kam test khel hai
 ' gavaskar ne kaha, 'duusari taraf bharat kii ballebaaji or gendbaaji main khaas samasya nahin he
 They are full of confidence after winning the second Test match
 ' gavaskar se poocha gaya ki yadi cheteshwar pujaara ko antim ekadash main chunaa jaataa he to unke liye unka kya sandesh hoga, unhone kaha, 'unhen is maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaanaa chahie
 Now the ball will be in his court
 pujaara bhi rahane kii tarah ek aisa khilaadi he jo shikaayat nahin karata or kisi bhi pojishan par khilne ke liye taiyaar rahata he
 i wish him all the best
 ' Gavaskar said that swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar should be kept in the team, as the team needs to take 20 wickets to win the Test
 unhone kaha, 'yah nirnaayak test he or yadi aap jeetna chaahate ho to aapako 20 wicket lene honge
 For this, India should hire five specialist bowlers
 yadi pich main kuch ghaas chhod di jaati he jaisi ki sambhaavna he to phir main chaahunga ki bhubaneshwar ko team main rakhaa jaae kyonki is tarah kii paristhitiyon main 20 wicket lene ke liye aapako swing gendbaaj kii jarurat padati he
 ' is purv captain ne kaha, 'stuart kaa puraa sammaan karte hue meraa maananaa he ki vah ek pari main paanch wicket lene vaala gendbaaj nahin he
 He played well in the second Test, but could not bowl accurately
 ' sinhalaij sports club kii pich main kuch ghaas hone kii sambhaavna he
 Gavaskar told NDTV about this, 'indian spinners did very well against the Sri Lankan batsmen
 unke spinneron main keval rangana herath hi pehle test match main acha pradarshan kar paye the
 Comments murali vijay or riddhimaan saaha ke chotil hone ke kaaran bharat do nae khilaadiyon ko utaaregaa, lekin gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki srilanka kii sthiti bhartiya team se badtar he, kyonki use kumaar sangakaara kii kami khalegi
 He said, 'sangakkara was a big player and there is no good option to fill his place
 vah haalanki siries main acha pradarshan nahin kar paae, lekin team or dressing room main unki upasthiti kii kami khalegi
 The Sri Lankan team lacks experience and most of its players, except Angelo Mathews, have played very few Test games

 Many important decisions will be taken in the politics of Bihar in August
 ye ek aisa maheenaa he jo rajya kii raajnneeti aakhir kis karavat legi wo tay karegaa
 The highest suspense is on the seat-sharing between Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav and the Congress party
 ab jab ye tay man ja rahaa he ki ye teenon dal ek saath chunavi maidan main jaaenge tab teenon dalon kii sanyukt chunavi sabha yaa kaaryakarta sammelan bas is baat par atka he ki siton ke talmail par baatcheet kab shuru hoti he or kab khatm hogi
 The biggest screw is about how many seats the three parties will contest and what will be its formula or basis
 rashtriya janata dal puraa prayaas karegi ki siton ke bantwaare par pichley loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaam, khaskar vidhansabha ke nateezon ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya jaye
 And here he would argue that if the Rashtriya Janata Dal does not get respectable seats, then there can be discontent among the Yadav voters
 vahiin janata dal united 2010 ke chunaav parinaam ke aadhaar par siton ke talmail kaa tark degi kyonki tab wo na keval 100 se adhik siton par chunaav ladegi balki apane votaron main sandesh degi ki aakhir gathbandhan main nitish kumaar kii tuuti abhi bhi bol rahi he
 The effort of the Congress party will be to get maximum number of seats and whether or not there are any number of seats, but it does not have to face much difficulty in winning the seats
 lekin ye sab is baat par nirbhar karata he ki lalu yadav or nitish kumaar siton ke talmail ko kitni praathamikta dete hai
 At the same time, his opponents who were speculating that Lalu Yadav may have accepted Nitish Kumar as the Chief Minister, but this alliance might be broken due to the seat coordination, now waiting for the results of talks on the seats of the Grand Alliance
 lekin bijepi kaa prayaas hoga ki wo na keval kam se kam 160 siton par chunaav lade balki apane sabhi sahyogiyon ko saath lekar chale
 However, this month, three rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi are also to be held in Bihar, so under the garb of these rallies, for the time being, they will try to avoid the issue of talks on seats
 tippaniyan But BJP strategists are satisfied that every ally in their alliance has the ability to transfer their votes and like Lalu Yadav, they should not worry about their base vote being in the field of rebel candidates
 bijepi sabase zyada is baat ko lekar aashwast he ki pichhali baar janata dal united dwaara jiti gai adhikansh siton par argedy ummidavaar duusare sthaan par the or is baar wo siten agar janata dal united ko chali bhi jaati hai tab haare ummidavaar ghar baithne ke badale baagi ummidavaar ke rup main chunavi maidan main honge
 But everyone knows that this time the key to power will be in the hands of the three voters of Bihar - women, extremely backward and new voters and the alliance that will be more inclined towards these three tors will win
 ab jab ye tay man ja rahaa he ki ye teenon dal ek saath chunavi maidan main jaaenge tab teenon dalon kii sanyukt chunavi sabha yaa kaaryakarta sammelan bas is baat par atka he ki siton ke talmail par baatcheet kab shuru hoti he or kab khatm hogi

 congress party kaa prayaas hoga ki use adhik se adhik siten milen or manamafik siton kii sankhya ho yaa nahin lekin jo siten milen usase jeetne main use bahut zyada mushkilon kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 But it all depends on how much Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar give priority to seat coordination
 vahiin unke virdohi jo is baat kaa kayaas lagaaye baithe the ki lalu yadav ne bhale nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri maan liya ho, lekin siton ke talmail par shaayad ye gathbandhan tut jaye, ab mahagathbandhan ke siton par baatcheet ke nateezon kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 But bjp's effort will be that they not only contested at least 160 seats but also carry all their allies together
 haalanki is maheene pradhanmantri narendra modi kii teen reliyaan bhi bihar main honi hai, isliye in reliyon kii aad main filhal wo siton par baatcheet ke masale ko taalane kii koshish karegi
 The comments lekin bijepi ke ranneetikaar is baat se santusht hai ki unke gathbandhan main har sahyogi apana vot transfar kara paane kii kshamta rakhte hai or lalu yadav kii tarah unhen apane aadharbhoot vot ko baagi ummidavaaron ke maidan main rahane par koi chintaa nahin kerani
 BJP is most convinced that RJD candidates were in second place on most seats won by Janata Dal United last time, and this time even if those seats are passed on to Janata Dal United, then the loser candidate in lieu of sitting at home
 As will be in the election field
 lekin sab jaanate hai ki is baar satta kii chaabi bihar ke teen matadaataaon - mahila, ati pichhadaa or nae votaron ke haath main hogi or jis gathbandhan ke taraf in teen votaron kaa rujhaan zyada hoga, jeet usee kii hogi

 Input: IANS ise andhvishwaas mana jaae yaa phir kuch or ki aam dinon main ghar kii khapril par 'kaua' kii hajiri ko bundeli ashubh maan inhen 'hadi' kah kar dutkaarte hai, parapitru pakshamen ek pakhwada inhen kauon se 'dai-baba' kaa rishta kaayam kar purvajon ke shraadh main 'kaua bhoj' yojit karte hai
 People believe that ancestors can take the birth of a crow as well and the 'crow banquet' will give salvation to the ancestors
 
 
 jahaan shraadh main aamantrit kiye jate hai 'kauwe'vaise bundelkhand main kai aisi puraani paramparaayen aaj bhi chal rahi hai, jo andhvishwaas kii ore ishaara karti hai
 Now take the Shraddha performed for ancestors in Pitrupaksha
 aam dinon main ghar kii choukhat yaa khapril par kaua ke baithne ko yahaan ke washindia ashubh maanate hai or use 'hadi' kah kar dutkaar kar bhaga dete hai, lekin ek pakhwada chalane vaale pitrupaksh main inhen kauwon se 'dai-baba' (dada-daadi) kaa rishta kaayam kar unki khatiri main 'kaua bhoj' tak yojit karte chale aa rahe hai
 For years Pindadanbujurg of the people have believed that ancestors can take the birth of crow, feeding the ravens gives salvation to the forefathers and soon they are born as humans
 khaas baat yah he ki shraadh kii purvasandhya par ghar kii bujurg mahila apane angan se oonchi aawaaj lagaakar 'dai-baba' ko bhoj main shaamil hone kaa aamantran detii hai or vahi mahila shraadh kii subah kai prakaar ke pakwaan banaakar ghar kii khapril par rakh detii hai, jise jhund main pahunche kaua khate hai
 It is necessary to mention here that in Bundelkhand, Gangapari crow is less and more of the common species, if a single Gangapari crow joined this feast on the day of Shraddha, then the members of that family are very happy that their ancestor will get salvation
 is come back
 kashton se nijaat ke liye kiijie shraadh va tarpanis puraani parampara ke bare main banda janapad ke penagara gaanv main kai saalon se pitru paksh ke kriyakarm karaate aa rahe bujurg brahman badri prasad dikshit bataate hai ki kisi bhi dharmagranth main purvajon ke shraadh main kaua bhoj karaane kaa ullekh nahin he, par 84 lakh yoni main kaua bhi aata he
 Depending on the deeds, the next birth is said to have occurred, the ancestral crow may have been born in the vagina
 vah bataate hai ki shraadh ke din punyadaan or bhoj karaane kii parampara chali aa rahi he, isliye is pakshi ko bhi aamantrit kiya jaataa he
 The auspicious coincidence on Pitrupaksha, liberated from the faults, an elderly woman from a backward class of the village, Sahadeiya (78), tells that she has been inviting crows to the feast for many years in the shraddh of her ancestors, when and how this tradition did not start
 But the educated class considers this tradition nonsense and superstition
 isi gaanv ke balram dikshit kaa kahana he ki gaiyr shikshit samaaj main bematlab kii paramparaayen thopi gai hai, jinka kuch bhi saamaajik aashay nahin he
 No one knows where and in what form posthumously was born
 yah bhale hi andhvishwaas se judi parampara ho, lekin bundelkhand main purvajon kaa shraadh karne vaala shikshit or gaiyr shikshit donon varg is anuthe bhoj kaa aayojan karwaata he

 " South African captain Graeme Smith, who announced his retirement from Test cricket, is leaving behind a unique record that will probably never be broken
 
 
 maujuuda match, jiske baad unhone sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii he, ko milakar unhone apane kariyar main kul 117 test match khele, jinamein se 109 main vah team ke captain rahe
 
 
 The figure is a world record, and the closest among the current players is Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who captained Team India in 53 Tests
 
 
 vaise, sabase zyaada test maichon main captaini karne waalon kii suchi main mahendra singh dhoni 10wein number par hai, lekin sheersh par maujuud greem smith ke baad suchi main aath aise khilaadi darj hai, jo ritair ho chuke hai, so, smith kaa yah record tootna lagbhag asambhav he, kyonki dhoni bhi 56 or test maichon main bhartiya captain rah paaenge, yah sandigdh lagata he
 
 
 Well, Graeme Smith played 109 matches as captain, out of which he won 53, and lost 28 matches, while 27 matches were drawn
 
 
 (antim match kaa parinaam abhi aana baaki he
 
 
 ) So his percentage of victory in this regard is 48
 62 he, jo kaaphi shandaar he
 
 
 However, Dhoni's win percentage is better than Graeme Smith's
 
 
 dhoni ne ab tak jin 53 maichon main team india kaa netritv kiya he, unamem se 26 main bhartiya jite hai, or 14 main shikast jheli he, jabaki 13 match drow bhi rahe hai

 Shivraj Jeevan Valmiki, secretary of the All India Congress Committee, raised a controversy on Wednesday by talking about Rahul Gandhi's marriage, but at the same time apologized
 valmiki ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne ‚Äòvanshavaad‚Äô rokane ke liye vivaah nahin karne kii kasam khai he
 Talking to reporters, Valmiki earlier said that Rahul has vowed not to marry to stop 'dynasty'
 haalanki bayaan dohraane ke liye kehane par unhone inkaar kar diya or turant maafee maang lee
 Valmiki said, 'I have read somewhere that, he (rahul) said that he will not marry to stop dynasty
 ‚Äô baad main unhone maafee maangate hue kaha, ‚Äòmain galat ho saktaa hum isliye main maafee maangata hum
 Soon after, the Congress leader changed the subject of interaction with the media and targeted Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for the 2002 riots
 modi par waar karte hue valmiki ne kaha, ‚Äòjahaan tak sawaal us dadhi vaale kaa he, vikaas nahin vinaash kiya he
 Asked for feedback on the comments of Nitesh, son of Congress minister Narayan Rane on Gujaratis, Valmiki said, "we will not ask him to make such disputed statements
" ‚Äô nitesh ne kaha tha ‚Äòmaine ek raajnneetik faisla liya he

 There may be questions regarding Ambati Rayudu Ambati Rayudu was kept in reserve players for the World Cup on behalf of BCCI
 iske baavjood world cap ke bich salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan or number chaar par khilne vaale vijay shankar ke chotil hone par bhi raidu ko team main nahin shaamil kiya gaya
 At the same time, Rishabh Pant and Mayank Agarwal were included in the team in his place
 is baat se niraash hokar ambati raidu ne cricket ko alavida kah diya tha
 It was being told that Mayank Agarwal was included in the team in place of Ambati Rayudu but the coach and captain had agreed
 batting order par ghir sakate hai coach or captainsemifinal newjiland se mili shikast ke baad little master sunil gavaskar mahendra singh dhoni ke batting order par sawaal kiye the
 He had said that when India lost the wickets of their 3 top batsmen cheaply, then Hardik Pandya and Rishabh Pant were batting
 donon mizaaj ke lihaaj se ek jaise ballebaaj hai
 He should have been replaced by Dhoni at one end, who could have advised Pant to stay restrained

 Questions can be asked on Dhoni's retirement
 After the defeat of the Indian team in the semi-final match of ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 against New Zealand, there is a lot of discussion about the retirement of veteran wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 aisa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki purv bhartiya captain emes dhoni world cap khatm hone ke baad apane sanyas kaa elaan kar dege
 But so far no such thing has been heard from Dhoni, but all the fans believe that Dhoni has now played his last international match
 dhoni ko 7wein number par bhejne kaa faisla kyon liya gaya ?semifinal mukaable main mahendra singh dhoni ko 7 number par bhejnaa faisla kiskaa tha? bataaya ja rahaa he ki batting coach sanjay bangar ne dhoni ko 7 number par bhejne kaa faisla kiya tha
 In such a situation, the coach and captain can also be asked why the assistant coach did not oppose this decision? centre main modi kii sarkaar bane 5 maheene hue hai or in paanch maheene main modi ke mantri pehle se amir ho gaye hai
 Among Modi's ministers, Jaitley's wealthiest ministers have prepared a report based on the information given by the PMO about their assets
 jiske mutabik paanch maheene main railmantri sadanand gauda kii sampatti doguna se bhi zyada ho gai he
 Sadanand Gowda had given an affidavit of assets worth Rs 9 crore 99 lakh in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin piemo ko di gai jaankaree ke mutabik unki sampatti 20 karod 35 lakh rupee ho gai he
 Similarly, the wealth of Minister of State for Industry Radhakrishnan p has increased by three crores
 loksabhaa chunaav ladate vakt unki sampatti 4 karod 9 lakh rupee thi
 Now the figure which he has given to the PMO is seven crore seven lakh rupees
 vittamantri arun jetali kii sampatti paanch maheene main ek fisadi badi he
 At the time of the Lok Sabha elections, Jaitley had declared assets worth Rs 113 crore two lakh
 is maheene piemo ko di gai jaankaree main unhone 114 karod 3 lakh rupee kii sampatti bataai he
 Legendary spinner Shane Warne has said that differences between Australian captain Michael Clarke and all-rounder Shane Watson may have occurred because Clarke changed Watson's batting order
 warn ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, 'main jab ipel main watson kaa captain tha to maine use puraa saport kiya tha
 He was the best player of the tournament
 watson pari kaa aagaaj karnaa chahta he, jabaki clark use madhyakram main ballebaaji karana chaahate hai
 So i am confident that at which place he (watson) should bat, there must have been some heated debate on this
 'purv australian captain ne yah bhi kaha, 'iskaa matlab logon ne is tarah nikaala ki ve ek duusare ko naapsand karte hai
 i think it was exaggerated
 main donon khilaadiyon ko acchhee tarah jaanata hum or donon se hameshaa baat karata rahata hum
 So i think this is not a correct statement

 Inspector Subodh arrested the accused of cow slaughter Abhishek said that father's way of working was different
 vah har cheez kii tah tak jate the or yahaan kai varisht adhikariyon se unka talmail nahin baith rahaa tha

 is maamle main inspector subodh ko dabaa diya gaya tha or giraftaar shaks kii jamaanat ho gai thi
 Abhishek told that then he (subodh) had told that the accused had said, its consequences would be bad
 abhishek ne kaha ki iskaa record police ke paas darj bhi hoga kyonki gohatya ke aarope main giraftaar hui thi or jo shaks pakadaa gaya tha usne pitaaji ( inspector subodh) ko dhamkee di thi

 Abhishek said, how was the lynching accident that a policeman was shot
 agar mukhyamantri is baat ko durghatana bol rahe hai to kisi report ke tahat hi bol rahe honge, vah report dikhaaen
 Abhishek said, the administration feels that if the murderers of cow slaughter, if they are found then they will get the murderer of my father

 If you are proving yourself innocent by taking the video, then why are you not coming forward and why are they running away? If anyone is protecting them, i believe the police will be caught

 The day the incident took place, there was ijtama on one side and violence erupted on the other side

 Amid mounting controversy, Abhishek finally agreed to withdraw his application to the Registrar of Trademarks on 14 November
 rajya sarkaar ne bhi is maamle ko 'band adhyay' kahkar khaarij kar diya he
 But the opposition is not going to stop the attack against Didi and her 'bhaipo' (nephew) so soon

 The Varanasi police has revealed an incident in which the necessary documents, letters and information of the people who should have left the post office and reached their homes reached the scrap shop

 Police arrested a man red-handed
 uske paas se jaruri kagajaton kii do boriyaan baraamad hui hai jinamein 300 chitthiyon ke saath, dm, esaspi or adaalat se bheje gayi jaruri kaagazat tak the

 kyonki dak vibhaag ke karmchaariyon kii nigaah main ye kooda tha or wo paisa kamaane ke laalach main ise kabadi ke yahaan bech diya karte the
 Dinesh Singh, SP City of Varanasi, explains, "on Thursday evening, a criminal has been arrested from the Cantt station, from whom very important post offices have been found which he reached to sell to Kabadi
 soochna milane par kaint thane kii force pahunchi or maukey se is shaks ko giraftaar kiya
 After the arrest, when seen, both the sacks have all the orders of the court which come from the General Post, they are lying, the ash is lying, the bank papers are lying

 This is a huge fraud with the people

 However, after such a big negligence of the postal department, now the officers are seen escaping from the camera, but the way the black man's black handiwork has come to the fore is very shameful
 ye kagajaat agar police ke haath nahin lagate to wo log shaayad intjaar kii karte rah jate jinke paas inhen pahunchnaa tha

 kya iske liye snicometer kii madad lee gai? kya snico ke upyog kii anumati he? kya audio technitian kii madad lee gai? yaa tisare ampire ne unhen out de diya
 Many such questions can be asked

 Tendulkar will also go to the specialist

 *** Many of our habits are such that we develop, but in terms of health, these can prove to be very dangerous
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki aaj ke samay main jabaki zyaadaatar logon kii jeevanstyli ast-vyast he, aise main swasthya par iskaa behad bura prabhaav padataa he
 At the same time, people who pay attention to their health in this run-of-the-mill life, live longer and better than those who remain careless in this matter
 aaj ke samay main jabaki jeevanstyli, bhagdaud kaa doosraa naam ban chuki he to hamaari kai aadaten aisi bhi hoti hai jo beli fat ko nyotaa dene kaa kaam karti hai
 Many times it happens that the habits which we understand better affect our health
 aapmen se kuch hi logon ko shaayad ye pataa hoga ki beli fat ko kam kar paanaa sabase mushkil hota he
 Reducing the fat of any other body part is not as difficult as reducing belly fat
 agar aapkaa pet bhi lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he to aapako yah dhyaan dene kii jarurat he ki kahin aapaki bhi kuch aadaten aisi to nahin jinke chalate aapkaa pet badhata ja rahaa he
 1
 diet soda yaa phir soft drink pine kii aadat ho sakati he khatarnatiogar aap galati se bhi yah sochate hai ki diet soda pinaa swasthya ke liye phydemand he to aapako bataa den ki yah aapaki bahut badi galati ho sakati he
 If you do not want to increase fat, then quit the habit of drinking soft drinks from today
 is tarah ke peya-padaarthon main sugar or calories kii bharpoor maatra hoti he jo charbi badhaane kaa kaam karti he
 2
 lagaataar baithkar kaam karnaa bhi he khatarnakajo log zyaadaatar vakt kursi par baithkar kaam karte hai unhen bhi beli fat kii shikaayat ho jaati he
 Most people doing desk jobs become obese
 aise logon ko na keval bade hue pet kii shikaayat ho jaati he balki unki jaanghen or qamar bhi bedaul ho jaati hai
 Women are especially affected by this

 mil baithe do yaar or ban gai jodi 420
 One such pair, whosoever came in the affair, was ruined
 baat ho rahi he south kii heroin leena maaria or uske boyfriend balaji kii
 After the arrest of Maria in Delhi, the news about these two coming from Chennai is shocking
 five star main rahanaa banty kaa shauq tha, to karodon kii gaadiyaan main ghoomana bubbly kaa shauk
 This hobby brought the two closer, because hobby is a big thing
 or badi chijen donon buree chizon se puri kar rahe the
 One is the illusion, the other is illusion
 ek dhokhebaaz, to duusari faiebi
 One would be robbed of his words, and the other by his ways
 donon ne dimag or husn kaa aisa khatarnaak cocktail taiyaar kiya ki log apni marji se inaki jholii main karodon daalate chale gaye
 This pair of bunty-babli was so amazing that one would change his face each time, the other would play every wager with his only face
 banty chehre ke saath ek saath kai bhashaa bolta, to bubbly uski boli kii guarantee banati
 In this way, both together, half the South India did not know how many rich people were brought to the mouth of poverty
 jon abraham kii home production film chennai express main jaldi apane jalwe bikhane aa rahi bubbly yani south kii mashhoor heroin leena maaria paul or uske natvarlaal boyfrand balaji ke bare me dhire-dhire jo khulaase ho rahe hai, wo sachmuch chaunkaane vaale hai
 On May 28, a joint team of Delhi and Chennai police arrested Leena Maria from outside a mall in South Delhi, while her boyfriend escaped by dodging the police
 baad main maaria ko chennai police apane saath le gai, kyonki donon ke zyaadaatar gunaah vahiin darj hai
 After all, how did bunty-babli lime people? How many have you done so far? What is the secret of these millions of cars recovered from them

 Bunty is still not with the police

 By becoming a government official, he has robbed many people in his web and robbed them
 darasal balaji bade hi shaatiranaa tareeke se logon ko apana shikaar banaata tha
 He used to meet him as an IAS or a big government officer and then used to give him a bank account number by dreaming of a government plan
 jab uskaa shikaar us bank acount main paise transfar kara detaa tha, to wo acount se paise nikaalkar vahaan se raffuchakkar ho jaataa tha
 Balaji continued to make people a victim of his own fraud for many years
 lekin 2011 main bangalore police ne use jaalsaaji ke maamle main giraftaar kiya, to dhire-dhire uske baaki kai karnaamon kaa kaccha-chittha khud-ba-khud police ke saamne khulata chalaa gaya
 Even after coming out of jail, Balaji did not improve
 lekin apane police record kii vajah se usne apana thikaana badal liya or wo chennai chalaa gaya
 During this time he met Leena Maria Paul from Dubai
 mahangi gadiyon main ghoomane, mahange kapade pahanane or five star rahan-sahan jaldi hi maaria ko balaji ke kareeb le ai or donon main pyaar ho gaya
 In Chennai, Maria got the lead role of the heroine in many films with the help of Balaji and she became famous in Tollywood upon seeing her
 saath vakt gujaarne ke dauraan hi maaria ko pataa chalaa ki balaji kii sari kamai kaa jariya dhokhadhadi he
 Balaji, who is a fluent English speaker, calls himself an IAS officer and takes money from a common businessman or a loan from a bank to get new projects passed
 iske baad paisa haath aate hi wo gaayab ho jaataa
 He later made Maria his partner for this work and with his help forged 19 crore from a bank and then left Chennai and came to Delhi

 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ko dilli hai court se jhatka laga he
 Virbhadra's plea to quash the ed's FIR in the case of disproportionate assets has been rejected
 sibiai kii sitambar 2015 me darj kii gai exiaar par hi baad me idi ne exiaar darj kar lee thi
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier summoned Virbhadra, his wife Pratibha Singh and son Vikramaditya for questioning in the Mani laundering case

 raajnneeti or rajkaaj main palati maarna kya hameshaa hi galat hota he? saamaanya dharna to yahi he ki aisa karnaa galat hota he
 The Congress is accusing the Narendra Modi government, which is going to complete a year in power, that it has proved to be a U-turn government in terms of many policies, as it has adopted the same policies of the UPA that it once opposed
 sawaal he ki ise you-turn sarkaar kahe jane par ham itnaa khush kyon ho rahe hai?sachaai yah he ki pradhanmantri ke bataur modi ne apni party ke chunaav-purv paksh se jin chaar maamalon main badi palati maari he, vah vyaavhaarik he or hamaare vyapak hit main he
 It starts with the nuclear deal
 bijepi ke adhyaksh rahe laalkrishna adwani ne 2008 main parmaanu qaraar karne par amada upie sarkaar ko giraane ke liye prakaash karaat kii party kaa saath diya tha jise vah rashtravirohi kahati thi
 Today, Modi is calling this agreement the 'centerpiece' of indo-us relations
 is qaraar kaa virodh bijepi itane tikhe tareeke se kar rahi thi ki maine jab adwani se (unke sansmaranon kii kitaab ke locarpan) poocha ki ve parmaanu qaraar kaa virodh kyon kar rahe hai jabaki khud atal bihari vaajapeyi ne isaki neenv rakhi thi, to unhone camere par mujhe kah daalaa, "main jaanata hum ki aap iskaa upie se bhi kahin zyada shashakt samarthan karte hai
 "modi has reversed it without any hesitation or regret
 bijepi ne agali palati bangladesh ke saath bhu-seemaa samjhaute (elbs) par maari he
 When Manmohan Singh finalized the deal with Sheikh Hasina, the BJP came in the way
 aaj modi ne ise bina kisi sanshodhan ke paarit karvaa diya he
 The third platoon appeared last week
 upie-1 main bilkul parmaanu qaraar kii tarj par bijepi ke netritv main samooche vipaksh ne bahubrands khudara vyapaar main 51 fisadi pratyaksh videshi nivesh ko manjuuri die jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 This opposition to the BJP looked natural as the Baniya community, which has held traditional retail trade (grocery) in India, has been seen by the BJP as its loyal vote bank and FDI was seen as a threat to it
 aresas vaise bhi kisi videshi yaa aisi badi cheez ke khilaaf hi rahata he or yah faisla to bahut bada tha jisamen 51 fisadi videshi ansh bhi tha
 Walmart was named as the satanic 'dunkel Uncle' on the lines of economic reforms that took place two decades ago when the first draft of the World Trade Organization came to be known as Dunkle
 uma bharti ne kah diya ki wallmart agar bharat ke kareeb bhi aayaa to qayaamat ho jaaegi
 This was the first issue related to economic reforms for which the Congress had put its political fortunes at stake and Prime Minister, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi held a rally in support of FDI at Ramlila Maidan
 parmaanu qaraar kii tarah is mudde par bhi loksabhaa main mat vibhaajan hua (haalanki parmaanu qaraar kii hi tarah ise bhi sansadeey manjuuri kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin thi)
 The UPA won, but the BJP threatened to withdraw it if it came to power
 uskaa virodh party ke ghoshnaptr main bhi darj he
 When the Modi government announced a comprehensive policy on FDI last week, the upa's decision was confirmed and FDI was listed in the multi-brand retail business
 is hafte chauthaa you-turn hamaare saamne namoodaar he jab modi ek saal ke bheetar china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ke saath teesri baithak karne ja rahe hai
 a central theme in the upa's criticism of the BJP was that the government was appeasing both China and Pakistan and that the NDA would take a tough stance against both after coming into the government
 pakistan ke maamle main to is vaade ko nibhaayaa gaya he
 However i think this attitude is indiscriminate and temporary which will eventually need to be changed
 china par haalanki modi kii palati baaki teen masalon ke mukaable kahin zyada naatakeey he
 When Xi came to India, China sent its troops across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to threaten India
 prime time channelon par mili tamaam ulahnon ke baavjood modi is par chup rahe
 They are holding the Indian security establishment normally fragile on the issue of China, on the issue of investment, visas and even response to the sino-pakistan deal
 yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki pakistan ko china se mil rahi sainya madad par bharat kii pratikriya kitni sanyat rahi he jabaki america dwaara nae hathiyaaron ke liye kiye gaye vaade ko to is tarah nazarandaaj kar diya gaya he goyaa uskaa koi matlab hi na ho
 However, there are other indications on the issue of China, which confirm the fundamental change in the rss's post-1962 view on it
 hamane dekha ki unhone rafel saude ko mul aakaar ke mukaable chhaantkar ek-chauthai tak laa diya
 Now we see that the Modi government has decided to bring it to one-third of what the UPA had decided to strengthen the Eastern Assault Corps with 90,000 troops
 ek baar phir modi china main hai or seemaa samjhaute kaa bhi zikr unhone kiya he
 The first three decisions i think are actually an attempt to maintain broad continuity in national policies, especially where Parliament approved them
 chauthi palati sabase zyada ahm he
 In the adventurous and risky attitude towards China, we see that Modi is devising a different principle of national security, which corrects the old militaristic attitude towards China, where the issue is less as a threat and more as an opportunity
 Is being judged
 yaa phir ho saktaa he ki is masale par kisi gatirodh kii ummid kii ja rahi ho
 i would even like to say that Modi has liberated Pakistan and the worldview of his establishment on the military shame of 1962
 ve jaanate hai ki dobaaraa jang nahin ladi ja sakati, 2015 kii duniya bilkul alahada he or saath ke dashak main jang ke liye kiya gaya aresas kaa aahvaan ab kaam nahin aayega, ki "aaj himalay kii chotii se phir hamane lalakaara he, dur hato i duniya waalo, hindustan hamaara he
 "when Modi is embracing the invader of his past today, he has turned down this warning of his thinkers, who are saying that they too should not be caught in a sibling jumble like Nehru from China
 yah tamaam naatakeey kadam jahaan bade aasaani se uthaae ja chuke hai, jiesti or bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak kaa masalaa ab bhi fansaa hua he
 The question arises that how did U-turn work on some things, while the other issues did not reverse? Come, p
 ve
 Take some lessons from Narasimha Rao
 ek rajnatik samvaadadaata ke bataur mujhe jitne bhi netaaon ko jaanane kaa mauka mila, unamem sabase zyada sanjokar rakhane laayak samvaad meraa agar kisi ke saath rahaa he to ve raav the
 The principle he once revealed in a recorded 125-hour dialogue, i would like to call it the PVNR theory of riskless U-turn
 maine unase poocha tha ki aaajeevan samaajawaadee rahane ke baavjood aakhir 1991 kii aitihaasik garmiyon main unhone arthvyavastha ke masale par you-turn lene ke liye khud ko kaise raji kiya? unhone kaha ki bharat jaise jatil desh main aap yah gavaara nahin kar sakate ki aapako koi you-turn letaa dekh le
 The question arises that Narasimha Rao finally showed without taking a U-turn, how did he take a U-turn? i was listening to him like a good student
 us bujurg shaks ne kaha, "bhai, yah maan lo ki aapke pair ke neeche kii jameen hi gum rahi he," or aisa kehete hi is gyaan par unhone apni ek durlabh muskaan bikher di
 In his first year as Prime Minister, how did Modi finally describe Rao's theory on the scale of our U-turn? On the nuclear deal, FDI in retail trade and Bangladesh border agreement, it was much easier to pretend that the land under foot has already been eroded
 pehle do ko loksabhaa main maton se paarit kar diya gaya tha, lihaaja unki party ne agar uske khilaaf bhi vot diya rahaa ho to kya sansadeey manjuuri se paarit ek niti ko badalanaa sansadeey garima ke saath khilwaad nahin hota? in tamaam masalon ko ek manje hue rajaneta ke faislon ke taur par liya ja saktaa he
 Her party's opposition to the LBA has not been as strong in the past and Mamata Banerjee has been the leader in stopping it anyway
 isliye bijepi ke paas ek dhaal maujuud he
 The equation on GST and land acquisition was different
 ek ko bijepi ne aanshik taur par baadhit kiya tha jabaki duusare kaa purna samarthan kiya tha
 Both have presented challenges in their own way
 bijepi ne kabhi bhi saidhantik taur par jiesti kaa virodh nahin kiya tha balki madhya pradesh ke vitt mantri raghavji ko saamne rakhkar uskaa virodh ranneetik rup se kiya tha, jo apane naukar ke lagaae yon shoshan sambandhi aaropon ke baad kaal kavlit ho gaye
 If Modi had also dealt with the issue of GST on the lines of the nuclear deal and especially the humility in the case of LBA and the credit given to his predecessor government, he would have got it passed
 unhone or unki party ne isaki bajaae ise apni pahal bataane kii galati kar di
 Whatever happens, it will pass in the next session and a Joint Select Committee will help to free it from all the distortions that the UPA has put in it
 bhoomi adhigrahan kaa masalaa nihaayat hi alahada he kyonki bijepi apane paksh ko upie ke bainks nahin badal rahi he balki aisa karke vah upie kaa samarthan kar rahi he
 It voted enthusiastically in favor of this strange new law in 2013 which i thought was very giddy in which the system of social impact assessment is very complex
 isane desh bhar ke enjio ko baithe-baithaae ek rojgaar kii guarantee de di he
 BJP leaders did not raise any questions while voting in support of this, rather they wanted to make this law more stringent
 aaj vahi kanoon uski sehat ko bigaad rahaa he or ve usamen buniyadi badlaav karnaa chaah rahe hai
 This is the real U-turn
 yahaan aap bahaanaa nahin bana sakate ki aapke pairon ke neeche kii jameen khisak rahi he
 This is due to your lack of patience and experience because you brought a law full of politics through ordinance
 modi ne apane pehle saal main vyaavhaarikta or saahas donon kaa parichay diya he
 Whatever may have happened on beef, cow dung, homecoming and church, they have dragged the government out of the RSS / bjp's ideological shell with great success
 ab yah kahin zyada modi sarkaar he jo unke apane saanche main dhali he or main to ise philhal thik maanata hum
 One of them is lacking in parliamentary prowess that they are unable to use politeness in a strategic manner
 loktantr main sarkaar chalaanaa test match cricket khilne jaisaa he
 Just as cricket is played session by session, the government is played in the sessions of Parliament
 hamen dekhnaa baaki he ki modi is raah ko kitna aasaan bana pate hai
 It will not be in anyone's interest and it will not be in their own interest that their fate be like that of their friend Barack Obama, who cannot get his Parliament to pass a bill
