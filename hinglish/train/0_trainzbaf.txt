 com / 0ztsrh5aej Despite disappointing defeats at the hands of Sri Lanka and Pakistan, India's middle-order batsman Ambati Rayudu, while fully supporting the captaining captain Virat Kohli and his teammates, said that the captain and the team are doing everything they can
 rayudu ne afghanistan ke khilaaf yahaan buudhvaar ko team ke antim round robin match kii purv sandhya par kaha, vah dhoni bhai se kaaphi kuch sikh rahaa he
 He did a fantastic job against Pakistan
 ham haar rahe hai, lekin ham kaaphi prayaas kar rahe hai
 He said, we are learning a lot and as you saw the matches we lost were very close
 ham puraa jor laga rahe hai or ek cricketer ke rup main ham bas yahi kar sakate hai
 India's hopes rested on Bangladesh: If Bangladesh upset the defending champions Pakistan today, India may get a chance to beat Afghanistan with a bonus point
 rayudu ne kaha, ham kal bonus ank ke saath jeetne kii koshish karenge or phir dekhte hai ki kya hota he
 Our focus is only on winning with bonus points
 ham aaj ke match ke baad sthiti kaa akalan karenge
 He said, Bangladesh's bowling team is very good, as we have seen in the competition
 hamen sirf is baat par dhyaan dena hoga ki ham ran banaaen
 a slow wicket cry Royarayudu played a 58-ball 62 against Pakistan and together with Ravindra Jadeja (52 not out from 49 balls) played an important role in bringing the team score to 245 for eight wickets
 bharat ne lagbhag jeet darj kar hi lee thi lekin shahid afridi ne ravindran aswin ke antim over main lagaataar do chakke jadkar pakistan ko ek wicket kii mahatvapurn jeet dilaa di
 Regarding the loss in two consecutive matches, Rayudu said, "if you pay attention to the matches, i think all the teams have to struggle in the middle hours because the wicket is slow and the ball is coming to a stop
 rayudu ne kaha, kaaphi wicket gir rahe hai isliye hamen tikkar khelnaa hota he or ant main pari kaa score 350 ran na hokar 250 ran hota he
 But we are going till the last ball
 aisa nahin he ki ham ran nahin bana rahe
 It is the same with all teams
 is bhartiya ballebaaj ne kaha ki isamen koi andeh nahin he ki pich dhimi he lekin peshewar hone ke naate unhen shikaayat nahin kerani chahie
 Rayudu has the responsibility to fill the position of players like Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina
 is bare main unhone kaha ki vah bharat-pakistan jaise dabaav vaale match main ardhashatak jadne se aatmavishvaas hasil karengeham acha kar rahe hai asia cap memrayudu ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki main prayek match ke saath sikh rahaa hum
 The last match gave me a lot of confidence as i played under a lot of pressure
 hamane wicket ganvaae or bharat-paak match hameshaa kaaphi dabaav main khelaa jaataa he
 i am glad that we were able to make a score which we almost defended
 dakshin africa or newjiland ke dauron ke baad bangladesh main bhi madhyakram ke lachar pradarshan ke bare main poochne par rayudu ne kaha, main newjiland ko lekar sunishchit nahin hum lekin main asia cap ke bare main baat kar saktaa hum
 We are doing well
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane jo score banaae vah kahin se bhi kam nahin the
 Rayudu will be replaced by Suresh Raina in the World T20 Championship to be held this month and he congratulated the Indian team for the upcoming tournament
 unhone kaha, main tii20 team main shaamil nahin hum
 i hope and pray that we will win the tournament

 pienbi mahaghotaale ko lekar bijepi ke baagi netaa shatrughna sinha ne centre sarkaar par hamalaa kiya he
 Former film actor Sinha has said that everyone is speaking on this matter from Law Minister to Defense Minister, but those who should speak are silent
 shatrughna ne kaha ki is maamle par vitt mantralay yaa piemo ko bolnaa chahie
 PM should speak, the whole country wants to hear them
 main vitt mantri or piem se prarthana karata hum ki is maamle par ve apana munh kholen
 He added, 'was the PMO sleeping when Nirav was photographed in Davos? Some of our own are involved in the scam
 isaki vajah se ghotalebaj protsaahit hote hai
 Sinha also said that the amount of scam that Nirav Modi has done, could have given loan waiver to millions of farmers
 sinha ne kaha ki amiron ko bank madad kar rahaa he, lekin garib karj ke tale pis rahe hai
 Sinha said that the government should accept its shortfall
 is maamle kii puri or sahi tareeke se jaanch honi chahie
 If government officials are involved in this then they should take responsibility for it
 isse pehle bhishatrughna sinha ne is maamle parkai twit kiye the
 In a tweet, he wrote that the elder watchman slept, the younger sleeper slept and we all kept watching
 shatrughna sinha kaa centre sarkaar par hamalaa nayaa nahin he
 He frequently attacks PM Narendra Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and bjp's National President Amit Shah on the internal affairs of the BJP from demonetisation to GST

 In the four-test series, 0–0, the backward Indian team will have to avoid balls going out of the stumps
 maaikel clark se lekar james patinson tak or peter sidle se mike hassi tak sabhi ne baar baar kaha he ki madan over phenkakar bhartiya ballebaaji ko dabaav main laayaa ja saktaa he jisase wicket milte hai
 Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin even went as far as to say that Sachin Tendulkar waits for the ball to come on the bat so that he can regain the rhythm
 yadi unhen baahar kii ore gend phenki jaye to un par dabaav banaaya ja saktaa he jaisaa ki pichley do test main dekha gaya
 Indians will now have to show aggression
 pichhali do pidhiyon main tej gendbaaji ke khilaaf bharat ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj rahe mohinder amarnath ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya he jo ab rashtriya chayankarta hai
 Before returning to India after two Tests, Amarnath had said that pressure can also be put on a good fast attack but it will have to be aggressive
 amarnath ne 1980 or 82 ke darmiyaan pakistan or westeindies ke tej akraman ke khilaaf kuch behtareen paariyaan kheli thi
 He had scored around 1200 runs including five centuries and seven fifties against bowlers like Imran Khan, Sarfaraz Nawaz, Sikander Bakht, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner
 barbados test main 1982-83 kii shrinkhalaa main unki 91 or 80 ran kii paariyaan yaadgaar rahi
 In those innings, India had scored 209 and 277 runs
 duusari pari main marshall kii ek gend unke munh par lagi or khun bahane laga
 He went out of the field with just stitches and returned to score 80 runs
 kanpur main 1983 main ek test main jab marshall ne gavaskar ko balla chhodane ke liye majaboor kiya tab yah mahaan ballebaaj apana karier bachaane ke liye jujh rahaa tha
 Gavaskar introduced his familiar hook shot in the next Test in Delhi
 marshall and company ko dabaav main laakar unhone sirf 128 gend main 121 ran bana daale
 Dilip Vengsarkar also believes that it is necessary to be aggressive against fast bowlers
 unhone 1983-84 main westeindies ke khilaaf lagaataar do shatak jade the
 Greg Chappell played some of the best innings at the World Cricket Series in the late seventies
 us anadhikrut shrinkhalaa ke paanch super test main chapel ne 69 kii ausat se 621 ran banaaye the
 His cuts and hook shots against the West Indies are still remembered today
 is shrinkhalaa main austrailia ne hari bhari pichen banaakar bharatiyon kii pareshaani or badhaa di he
 The fast balls falling on the off stump have opened the bar for India's strong batting order
 team ke ek yuva ballebaaj ne kaha, ‘hamane sochaa tha ki austrailian short aaf langth gendbaaji karenge jiske liye hamane taiyaari kii thi
 But they are bowling with full length and the green pitch gives them swing
 ab hamen frontroot par khelnaa pad rahaa he jisase pareshaani batch gai he

 mike kaa kahana he ki mere chalis saal ke akelepan kii kahani markege ke ghumaavdaar plot kii tarah he jisamen sunanevaala funs jaataa he
 It has dubious tenants, clutches, happiness of success, but the joke is not far away
 mike mere jeevanasathi or ek pathak hai or main ek kalakaar
 i sometimes look at my impossible life as if i were a surrealist, a figure spread across cinematic panes
 meraa naam balbir krishna he
 i was born in a Jat family in Bijraul village of Baghpat district in western Uttar Pradesh
 janm ghar par hi hua or parivaar main mujhe ballu kahkar pukaara jaataa tha
 Five years later, on the very first day of school, the teacher mocked my name and told it to be unfit, and said that from today my name will be Balbir
 is tarah upasthiti register or mere baaki jivan ke pannon par bhi vah naam hameshaa ke liye darj kar diya gaya
 There are countless injuries and such hard details in my story that i have shared with Mike only to date
 is kahani main dikhti laalasaa, bhukh or ummid ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 i wanted to live all the time
 us vakt bhi jab maine khud ko maarane kii koshish kii or 22 saal kii umr main jaakar rail kii patariyon par let gaya or apane pair kho die
 i might not have been able to live with my whole body, but today i am alive with my right mind
 main khushi mahasoos karne main samarth hum or jaanata hum ki kaise pyaar kiya jaataa he
 Mike does not believe in any kind of good or bad fortune, but says that if he had to believe in a miracle, it would have been like my life
 ballu ke taur par meraa shuruaati bachapan bahut acha tha
 i would go to the fields with Dad and Bobbo (mother), take care of raised buffalo, and swim in the canal with friends
 jaan-pahchaan ke log mere sir par thapki maarthe or mere kuulhe par chikoti kaat lete
 i was beautiful, but in some ways different from the rest of the boys
 bala mujhase ek saal badi meri bahan thi
 Just after i was born she was sent to the village of Bobbo to live with our maternal grandparents, because they needed a child at home
 main or bobbo vahaan saal main teen maheenon ke liye jate
 i loved my sister very much
 wo achche pal the
 They do not forget
 main duusare ladakon se juda tha, yah baat main bachapan se hi jaanata tha or dusron ne bhi ise bhaanp liya tha
 Soon my free childhood was over
 skool shuru hua
 He was not far from home
 main dopaher main ghar se khaanaa khaakar waapas skool aa jaataa
 My father and Bobbo would always be at work in the fields and they would leave food for me on a table
 nau saal kii umr main ek din khaali ghar main mujhe ek padosi mila
 He raped me
 main khunavkhun or langadaata hua skool der se pahunchaa
 My teacher immediately got an idea of the situation
 usne duusare bacchon ke saamne mujhe dhuna or ji bharkar gaaliyaan deen
 The children started laughing after seeing this spectacle
 usne mujhe 'ganduva' kaha, ek naam jo baad main balbir ke saath jud gaya
 Life changed with this name
 umr ke nauven saal main gaanv kii choti-si manohari duniya kahin kho gai or meraa baaki bachapan ek narak ke supurd ho gaya
 The neighbor threatened to kill me and tell my father about the bad thing
 is dhamkee se jab use apane niraapad hone kaa ehsaas ho gaya to main ek chota-sa ganda rahasy uskaa or uske jab-tab ke bahut-se saathiyon kaa aasaan shikaar ban gaya
 i began to play with it: other people and senior boys of my school or married men with children
 sabhi
 Many still live in the village
 mere saarvajanik apmaan or tiraskaar kii dhamkee kaa aatank meri chuppi kii guarantee tha
 From the middle of my teenage years, rape was a daily occurrence in my life
 varshon tak noche gaye mere sharir par aaj bhi un zakhmon ke nishaan hai
 i used to hide and throw the rag that was inserted between my legs with great tact, but how could father never know it? i hated him
 ve meri hifaazat main naakaam the or kabhi bhi mujhe suraksha kaa vaisaa maahaul nahin de paae ki main unki god main simatakar sukun kii saans le paata
 'why?' i could not ask him before he died, but as soon as i entered my teenage years, i would fight him everyday
 ve bobbo ko paison or duusari baton par roj peetate the
 There would be war between them and me on this matter, but they never understood their excess
 mere jaise bachche abhi tak batch rahe aantarik strot ke jariye jujhane ke raste nikaal lete hai
 i sat on the bank of the canal adjoining my land
 nahar pashchim se purab kii ore kshitij ko chooti hui bahati thi, or suryoday evam suryaast ke najaare uske pani main dikhte
 Nature gave me relief in the darkness of the people of the world, my enemies
 agar koi aasapaas hota to main thodaa dur hatakar ja baithta
 My ears were used to hearing my pranks from others
 aise main prakruti ne meraa saath diya
 Although it was true and reliable, it did not protect me from people
 khaane-pine ke liye mujhe ghar waapas janaa hi padataa
 This is where my habits started deteriorating
 skool se banks maarna, cigarette pinaa, chori karnaa, ghunsebaaji karte hue bhid janaa, dusron ke gharon main choriyaan karnaa, or gaanv se thodaa dur logon se lutpaat karnaa
 i was on the road to kill someone or kill me
 ek din subah pitaaji se meraa buree tarah se jhagada hua
 Result: At the age of 16, i escaped from village violence and got into all-round violence in Delhi
 dilli main maine jo paaya, vah yah ki yahaan to log or bhi zyaada beraham hai
 If the brutality of the village was as harsh as a war for me, then i was incredibly innocent for the city
 puraani dilli stesan par meri pehali hi raat mere kapade or pitaaji ke paison main se churaae gaye kuch sau rupye chin liye gaye
 After starving for two days and two nights on the sidewalk, i reached a very bad state and started begging
 main khaane ke liye bharat ke sabase deen-hin logon ke saath mandiron kii line main laga
 Then a few more days passed and i started to get small jobs including cleaning, washing utensils and everyday chores of the seasonal shopkeepers, each of whom was more current and two numbers
 maine nariyal, popcorn, or kai tarah ke junk food chauraahon par kaaron kii khidakiyon main beche
 i joined a group of sex workers
 unhone mujhe ek ladki kii tarah sajaayaa or mere chehre ko lip-pot diya
 i had to sell my body
 maine lambii duriyon par jane vaale trakon main helper ke taur par kaam shuru kiya
 i went to Bihar and Assam
 par ek baar to dilli se niklaa nahin ki rape phir shuru ho gaya
 One very bad night a frantic and disgusting trucker started raping me
 mujhe ahsaas hua ki meri apni jindagi bachaane ke liye use maarna hoga
 He was only a few inches away from losing my life in our dangerous battle
 maine use chhod diya or dilodimag main tutaa hua kisi tarah waapas dilli bhaag aayaa
 Luckily, luck showed some good days
 yah ek durlabh avasar tha ki mujhe haryana ke jind jile main ek sampann parivaar main naukar kaa kaam mil gaya
 Here i started adding pieces of my scattered existence for the first time in my life
 us ghar main bahut-si kitaaben thim, jo meri pahunch main thim
 i found stories and novels by Munshi Premchand and other great Indian writers who wrote about the struggles of the exploited
 maine khud ko un kitabon main har kahin paaya, or unhone mujhamen chetana ke beej boe
 If i had to go back to the village stuttering like a young man whom everyone stands to stumble upon, and start from where i left off, i never would have gone back
 iske bajaae gaanv chhodie ke kareeb dedh saal baad main us duurastha laapata duniya main puure dussahas ke saath, gusse main dahakta hua, or jo meri apni thi, yani meri jindagi—us par apana daawa jataane kii ladaai ladane pun: pravisht hua
 My old terrorists were happy to see me, but i soon explained to them that i was no longer weak, and if they tried to touch me, i would disclose their crime
 unamem se kuch ne phir bhi lagaataar koshish kii lekin maine unhen kaamyaab nahin hone diya
 i came to know that Bobbo used to stay awake in my absence without spinning a spinning wheel
 jab main waapas lautaa to pitaaji ne kuch nahin kaha, par akele main roe
 All my family was happy to have me back
 maine waapas skool main jaakar padhai kii or pitaaji ke adeshon kaa virodh karte hue apni kishor umr guzari
 My interest in painting started when i learned to hold pencils as a young child
 lekin mere gaanv main ladkiyaan hi chitra or sketch banaati thim, ladke nahin
 Boys used to work only as police or military personnel
 hyskool main drawing class main ekmaatr ladkaa hone ke kaaran bachche mujh par hansate the
 But i had learned to ignore such things
 parivaar ke nirantar virodh ke baavjood maine badot ke college main bie ke liye pravesh liya
 The folk art of the village and the idol of Goddess Durga (sanjhi) helped me to become an artist
 maine apane ek dost ke kumhaar pita se terracotta ke bartan bananaa siikhaa
 During my studies, i made a series of nude figures based on cave paintings of Ajanta, which i saw in college books
 ek din gaanv ke kuch bujurg ghar par aae hue the
 They saw these pictures of me
 uske baad unka vyavhaar mujhase badal gaya
 He said that i am doing dirty work
 gaanv main kisi ko bhi ajanta ke bare main kuch nahin pataa tha or is bare main kuch bhi bataanaa bekaar tha
 This was the time when my sexual identity was emerging, and i naturally knew that i had to keep it a secret
 main dar gaya
 i destroyed some of the drawings and hid the rest
 apane chitron main nagn akritiyon ko banane ke liye tab se lekar aaj tak mujhe apane saath or samaaj ke saath ek lanbaa sangharsh karnaa padaa, jo aaj bhi jari he
 i went to Agra and continued my MA in painting
 vahaan meraa ek anya ladke ke saath rishta bana
 i fell in love usne kaha ki wo bhi mujhe pyaar karata he, lekin aisa tha nahin
 He was playing with me
 ek din usne mujhe bataaya ki uski ek garlfriend he, or ki mujhe bhi ek banani chahie
 i was badly hurt
 lekin main usko apane najadik banaae rakhana chahta tha, lihaaja maine, mujhe pasand karne vaali ek ladki se muhabbat kii koshish kii
 But i soon realized that i could not be like others
 yah mere liye sambhav nahin tha
 That girl touches me, kisses me but there is no movement within me
 sadak par ham saath chalate, vah mujhase baaten karti jaati lekin meraa dhyaan uski bajaae aasapaas se guzarate sundar ladakon main ulajh jaataa
 i continued this kind of effort for two months, but i failed completely
 maine mahasoos kiya ki main lagaataar usase dhokhaa kar rahaa tha
 My head started exploding
 itnaa doharaapan jhel paanaa mere liye mushkil ho gaya
 One day, all my pain and all my dilemma was narrated in front of a friend of Rajasthan who was staying in the hostel
 main foot-footkar royaa
 After talking to him, i went to my room and went to sleep
 subah uthakar jab main hostel main chaay-naashte or duusare kaamon ke liye baahar niklaa to maine paaya ki har koi mujhe dekhakar hans rahaa he or meraa mazaaq bana rahaa he
 That friend of Rajasthan had conveyed my homosexuality to the entire hostel overnight
 apane premi se dhokhaa khaane or phir ek ladki se prem ke naatak ne vaise hi mujhe bheetar se tod diya tha
 After this humiliation and ridicule, i was as though i was inside
 meri manodasha aisi ho gai thi ki jab main samaaj main feet hi nahin baith saktaa to ab jeene kaa nnya arth he? apni 22 saal kii umr main maine kai ladaaiyaan jeetin, par unamem se kisi ke koi myne nahin the kyonki aakhri ladaai haari ja chuki thi
 i was not feeling anything
 ji karata tha ki saansen bas yaheen ruk jaaen
 In the morning, in the same clothes that i wore, my steps proceeded towards Raja Mandi station, which was nearby
 main logon se bahut dur chalaa janaa chahta tha
 On reaching the station, i started walking in the direction of Delhi, holding the track
 aage akbar ke makbare se pehle sunsaan ilaaka padataa he
 While walking, my ears also started uttering words that people in the village used to say to me: Ganduva, Bavla, Lullu, Mehla
 lullu hamaare yahaan keede-makodon ko bolte hai or mehla aise logon ko jo mahilaon main baithna pasand karte hai
 The truth was that i used to sit among girls or women as i was a frequent victim of men
 main vahaan apane ko surakshit paata tha
 My footsteps progressed on the tracks
 mujhe laga ki saare fasaad kii jad main hi hum
 i decided that i had to die now
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki train kab aegi
 i lay flat on the tracks
 dopaher 11 se 12 baje ke bich kaa koi samay hoga
 After 10-15 minutes, i suddenly heard a grunt in the tracks
 or phir horn baja
 i shivered badly
 vah bamushkil das second kaa samay hoga, jab mujhe laga ki nahin, mujhe maranaa nahin he or jinda rahane kii bhukh ko maine shiddat se mahasoos kiya
 i don't know if the trauma i experienced was a moment of clarity or whether it was the train itself
 lekin us aghat ke kshan main main samaj gaya ki jinda rahanaa hi sab kuch he
 i remember, in those last moments, i tried to push myself away from the claws
 uthakar bhaagna chaha lekin shaayad der ho chuki thi
 Before i could save myself, the train went past my feet
 or main vahaan apni kati taangon ke saath laavaaris padaa rah gaya
 My desire to be alive in those terrible moments of pain permeated me
 main bas yah jaanata tha ki mujhe khud ko kisi bhi tarah jinda rakhana he
 i rolled down the tracks like a stone and then started walking away from the track with the help of an elbow
 barsaat ke mausam main vah 14 sitambar kaa din tha
 The sun was very strong in the afternoon
 meraa galaa suukh chukaa tha
 On the way there was a lot of frozen water in a pit filled with water
 kinare jaakar donon haath pani ke bheetar tikaakar main ganda, garam pani pine laga
 This hot water felt like nectar
 risati taangon se ghistate or karahate hue main chalata rahaa
 There was no one around who could hear my groan
 ek se do ghante tak chalane ke baad mujhe kuch bachche gaay-bhens charaate dikhe
 i slowly approached and exerted my full strength and shouted for help
 par ve bachche paas aane kii bajaae darkar vahaan se bhaag gaye
 That was when i felt that everything was over now
 sir par suraj ko ek baar dekhne ke baad maine ab khud ko noummidi main nidhaal chhod diya
 i was still unconscious
 thodi der baad mere kaanon main kuch awaajen padin
 When i saw with my eyes, those children came as angels with their mothers
 iske baad jaise inasaaniyat apane sabase khubasurat rup main saamne aa gai thi
 Somehow they ran and called the traffic police, who took me from their jeep to Agra's S
 en
 Arrived at Medical College
 iske baad doctoron or college ke adhyapakon, chaatro kii puri fouj mujhe bachaane main lag gai
 Late night my family members also reached the hospital from the village
 jab main pun: chetana main aayaa to sabase bada ehsaas yahi tha ki main jinda hum or abhi bhi 'ge' hum
 This was such an unshakable truth that even death could not kill
 mujhe laga ki jinda rahane se bada anand kuch bhi nahin he
 Mike does not believe in reincarnation, but he says that if someone is born again, it was me in 1996
 yah baat maine pehle bhi kai baar jor dekar kahi he ki us din maine apane pair kho die the, lekin apana jivan paa liya tha
 There was no presumption that i would survive after the accident and no medical hope
 maine aspataal main jindagi or maut ke bich teen maheene guzaare
 When my hemoglobin reached the minimum level for anesthesia, the first of my many surgeries began, and reached the result of amputation at the knees
 agle kai saal maine ghar kii charpai par bobbo or chote bhai, 13 saal ke arun kii dekhbhaal main gujaarey
 My whole family was completely devastated after my accident
 un sabane mere ek-ek kshan ke dukh ko jhela
 Father was merely a poor farmer
 unki sari bachat mere ilaaj main kharch ho gai
 And had to take a loan from above
 mere parivaar ne mujhe bachaane ke liye har kuch kiya
 My relatives also helped us
 saubhaahgya se agra main mere samalangik hone kaa khulaasa mere saath sudur mere gaanv nahin pahunchaa
 i did not tell anyone that i had tried suicide
 maine accident ko mahaj accident hi rahane diya or is baat kii zyada charchaa nahin kii ki main ge hum
 i resumed my MA studies in bed with the help of Chitralekha Singh, a fellow professor at the college and two friends from the college, Swatantra Bala and Jagmohan Rawat
 unhone mujhe kitaaben bhejin or kaksha main upasthiti se chhot dilaai
 When i was able to get up, the professor found a charity that donated me a tricycle with a hand, which i used for three years
 mujhe padhai kerani thi, iske liye paisa chahie tha
 Dad's health was not good and the younger brother's age was too young to earn
 ham behad khastahal the
 In 1997, i started teaching young children in a public school in my village
 skool ke sansthaapak ne mujhe padhaane ke liye bulaayaa tha
 We divided forty students among ourselves
 maine maheene main 700 rupye kamanaa shuru kiya, lekin yah is baat par nirbhar tha ki bacchon ke parivaar waalon ne fees di he yaa nahin
 Another tragedy broke in 1999 on our shabby family
 meri bahan ek bhayanak durghatana main maari gai, or apane peeche do bachche chhod gai
 Everything was completely dark
 main apane bheetar puri tarah rikt or akelaa tha
 My heart was filled with immense pain
 mere aasapaas koi bhi nahin tha jisase main ise baantta, lekin main jaanata tha ki mere paas meri kala he
 i wanted to paint, but i had no money to buy paint, brushes and canvas
 ek roj maine ghar par saste bal point pen se kaagaj par kuch ukerna shuru kiya
 And soon i realized that cheap hair pens are a magical gift for me
 main din main padhaata or raat main, puri raat, chitra banaata
 Everyone knows that my art saved my life
 drawing to main bachapan se karata tha, lekin bistar par maine khud se hi siikhaa ki drawing karen kaise? saath hi paint karnaa bhi
 Whatever books and catalogs of art i felt, i dissected and analyzed them
 tab apane khud ke vishay or kirdaar khoje-ijad kiye or apni khud kii vidhiyaan gadhin
 Since my life was uncultivated, all my new works of painting were the same
 accident ke baad ke mere shuruaati kaamon main maine dukhiyaare bacchon or peedit inasaaniyat ko chitrit kiya kyonki us pasamanjar main main hi wo baccha tha
 i broke my broken youth, but without my whole body
 or beshak mere zyaadaatar kaam main kisi ko dikhne vaala vikhandan isi kaaran he
 Despite that my work appears in different stages
 uske bheetar ekta ke aise sutara hai jo use jodate hai, kyonki prathmat: yah aatmakathaatmak he
 In 2000, i was given artificial Jaipur feet
 ve baari or mote the lekin ve mere liye bhagwaan kaa rup the
 i learned to be with them, and they changed everything for me
 maine unhen pandrah saal tak pahana
 The same year i passed the NET-UGC exam and gave an interview for the post of lecturer in Allahabad
 panel main dow
 Yogendranath was a yogi, who was then the president of Uttar Pradesh Lalit Kala Academy in Lucknow
 main apane saath saste ball pen se banaai apni kuch drings liye tha, jo unhone dikhaane ko kaha
 i did not get a job but was impressed with my work and asked for my artist's resume
 unhen aashcharya hua ki mere paas wo nahin tha, or ki maine kabhi apane chitron kii pradarshnee lagane kii nahin sochi
 He contacted my Dr
 sabita naag se karaayaa jo mere gaanv se 60 kilometre dur meerut ke ek college ke chitrakala vibhaag kii adhyaksh thim
 Dr
 sabita naag mere liye ek maa kii tarah saamne ain
 After that everything changed for me
 unhone mere kaam ke photographs utaravaaye, unhen frem karavaaya, rajya kii acadamiyon main samooh pradarshaniyon ke liye aavedan bharwane main or meri pehali drings kii bikri karwaane main madad kii
 My paintings began to be selected, exhibited and awarded at many state and national level exhibitions
 san 2003 main maine apni public skool kii naukari chhod di or purnakalik painting bananaa shuru kar diya
 My art brought money and fame to my life
 san 2004 main sabita naag kii madad se mumbai ke ek korporate gharaane ne mujhe talasha
 They bought all my work for me at very low prices, but that little money was a big help for us
 us paise ne hamaari bahut-si samasyaayein sulajhaa deen
 We started living
 hamane khushi kaa ehsaas karnaa shuru kiya
 That money helped me save our family
 maine pitaaji ke liye behatar ilaaj or apane bhai ke liye acchhee shiksha or sarkari naukari kii vyavastha kii
 From 2004 to 2008 i sold around 135 drawings and paintings to the company
 2008 main maine tay kiya ki unhen or paintings nahin bechni hai
 i always knew that i could not marry and cheat on a girl, so i refused to marry
 mere bhai ne shaadi kii or hamaare parivaar kii dekhbhaal kaa jimmaa sambhala
 In 2008, i moved from the village to Delhi, to realize my dream of becoming a painter
 maine san 2010 main pehali ekal pradarshnee lagaai or yah bahut acchhee gai
 i sold my work a lot
 thodi kamyaabi ke baad maine tay kiya ki main ek sarkari adhyaaapak kii naukari karun
 And then i returned to the village
 maine apni duusari ekal pradarshnee 'out hair and nau' dilli kii lalit kala academy main san 2011 ke ant main kii
 It was a story of my artist and my own appearance
 maine is tathy ko ki main ek ge hum, sabake saamne saarvajanik rup se sweekaar kiya
 It was a magical feeling that i am now an out and proud gay
 pradarshnee main lagaai paintings main aise purush the jo nagn the, saath-saath the, puri tarah yonik the, par bhaavnaatmak rup se asanlagn the
 i painted my subjects on hundreds of small sexuality-rich images that i had compiled from the Internet and printed on canvas
 is tarah yah siries kai kaarnon se mere liye mahatvapurn thi
 Within the painting i see the landscapes where my subjects live
 main jaanata hum, ve vyakul karne vaale hai
 They are my visions of my dreams, nightmares, memories, concepts and terror
 mujhe pataa he ki ek bahut bada kshetra isamen aata he, lekin yah ek hi or vahi shaareerik, maansik or bhaavnaatmak duniya he jisamen main rahata hum
 It was very important to paint that series and bring it out
 pradarshnee ke duusare roj main puri tarah samaj gaya ki is tarah kaa sho kitna khatarnaak tha
 i started receiving anonymous phone calls accusing me of mixing Indian culture with mud, warning of closing the exhibition and threatening to kill me
 shahar main lage mere poster faad die gaye yaa kaale kar die gaye
 i was disabled
 pradarshnee ke aakhri din gailaree main aa-ja rahe logon kii filming ke dauraan ek ghus aae nakaabposh ne mujh par hamalaa kar diya
 He destroyed a painting and kicked me down on the floor
 main apni shaareerik asahaayta ke kaaran na to khud kii madad kar saktaa tha, na bhaag saktaa tha
 Immediately my family put pressure on me to cancel the remaining exhibition and return home
 jab main aspataal or police stesan ke darmyaan tha, ek dost ne mere liye ise sametanaa shuru kar diya
 Then several artist activists, including Ram Rahman, Johnny ML and Sunil Gupta, gathered at the gallery to urge me to continue it and offered me protection and friendship
 unhone yah khabar media main de di, jisane is story ko uthaaya or ek ativaadee harakat or abhivyakti kii aazaadee par hamale ke rup main report kiya
 Due to the publicity of the police, the police had to file a report, as they initially refused, saying that i am the only one who is responsible for this whole problem and what happened to me was right
 ek aapng samalangik kalakaar par hue hamale kii khabar duniya bhar ke media main prakashit hui
 After this my exhibition was re-organized at Triveni Kala Sangam
 dilli ke algebiti samudaay ne samuhik rup se isaki opening main shirkat kii
 This was the first time that i met people in my community who were proud to be recognized as gay
 yah mere liye ek nayaa ilham tha
 i was still a Jat of the village
 shaharon ke ge adhikaron ke paridrishy kaa mujhe kuch pataa nahin tha
 My awareness grew rapidly and it changed my identity and my concept of how to live
 isi pradarshnee ke dauraan meri mulaakaat engendard gailaree kii diarector maayna mukherjee se hui, baad main jinase meraa anmol rishta ban gaya
 He did many exhibitions of my paintings across India
 iske baad mujhe mere partner krishna ke jeene ke tareeke ke saath rahanaa gaiyrmunasib lagane laga
 In 2012, 13 years after the start of the relationship, we split up
 mujhe kisi cheez kaa dar nahin tha
 i had found myself
 maine samaj liya tha ki main koun hum
 i had attained independence
 pichley kuch saalon main apni youniktaa ko lekar, apni javaani ko lekar, apane accident ko lekar, apni kala ko lekar, mike se apni shaadi ko lekar main itane tarah se spasht hota rahaa hum ki yah spashtataa 'main koun hum', 'mujhe kya karnaa he' or har wo cheez jo main karnaa chahta hum yaa karuunga, kaa ek mantra ho gai he
 i am Balbir, with forty years of devastation and the aftermath, stepping outside, traveling, still venturing out into the world, and longing for life
 2012 main main mike se mila
 He came to my show at Pragati Maidan
 ham ek-duusare ke pyaar main pad gaye
 i always wanted to be with someone like a family
 main hameshaa ek purush se pyaar karnaa chahta tha
 i tried for 13 years with Krishna but it did not succeed
 maaikel ne mujhe shaadi kaa yah mauka diya, lekin yah aasaan nahin tha
 Homosexual relationships are a crime in India and gay marriage cannot be legalized
 hamaare yahaan dhara 377 he jo samalangikon ko pyaar karne kii ijaajat nahin detii
 In April 2013 Mike proposed to me for the wedding and i accepted
 vah meri jindagi main sabase khushi kaa kshan tha
 We got engaged in a simple ceremony in Delhi
 hamaari sagaai kii khabar mere gaanv pahunchi or har cheez mujhase juda ho gai
 Bobbo and brother broke all ties with me
 paagalpan peeche pad gaya
 i missed my job
 vahaan meri jindagi ko khatra paidaa ho gaya
 a friend of mine cautioned me that the people of the village have turned against me
 meraa gaanv, meraa janmasthan bhi mujhase chhot gaya
 i have not been to my village since then
 main mike ke saath dilli chalaa gaya or kai maheenon ke liye khud ko ghar ke bheetar chupa liya
 For three years i could not see Bobbo and any other family members
 main abhi bhi yah nahin samaj paaya ki hamaare jaise kuch logon ko sab kuch kho dena padataa he, isliye ki unhone kisi ko pyaar ke liye chunaa?san 2013 ke antim maheenon main mujhe hyderabad ke ek five star hotel main sthit ek ddeergha main pradarshnee ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 The next day of a grand and successful opening, my show was called off due to moral police, social pressures and phone calls from 'quite well-known, influential' people
 hamaare bharat main aakhir kya ho rahaa he? ham jaanate hai ki yahaan sankeern samooh, sanghathan, dharmik or rajnatik partiyaan hai
 They deny the presence of sexual artistic expression more than thousands of years old in the cultural landscape of India
 aisi abhivyaktiyon or aacharan ko 'paaramparik' bhartiya saanskrithik or dharmik mulyon ke liye apmanjanak maanate hai
 Our self-proclaimed censors often declare punishment as a threat of violence
 ve kalatmak abhivyaktiyon ko rokane ke liye aksar safaltaapurvak dabaav banane kii koshish karte hai
 i married Mike in 2014 in New York
 iske baad mike ne bharat main apni naukari chhod dene kaa faisla kiya
 Because of this we decided to move to America
 2016 main ham america puri tarah chale gaye
 Before leaving India, my whole family — Bobbo, brother, nephew, two nephews — came to meet me in Delhi
 or yah vah vakt tha jab maine mahasoos kiya ki pyaar hi sab kuch he
 We bought a dream house near New York here in the US and built an art studio there
 main puraa din paint karata hum
 i am also exhibiting my work in India and America
 main mike ke saath khushgavaar rah rahaa hum
 Even after going through all these painful stages of my life, i feel that i am very lucky
 mike ke saath bhavishya behad ummiido se bharaa hua or sunaharaa dikhaai detaa he
 There is nothing better than feeling that i have two houses today
 ek bharat jahaan main paidaa hua or jahaan se mujhe sab kuch mila or ek america, jahaan aaj main rah rahaa hum
 Hopefully in future we will also build a small house in Delhi and will be able to live there like a legally married family

 iske saath hi srilanka ke mahaan ballebaaj kumaar sangakaara or mahela jayavardhane ko bhi haar ke saath vanade cricket se vidaa leni hogi
 Both were members of the World Cup 2007 and 2011 runners-up teams, both of whom wanted to break their careers with a victory
 vanade cricket main lagaataar chaar shatak jamaane vaale ekmaatr ballebaaj sangakaara ne srilanka ke liye sarvaadhik 45 ran banaae
 Sangakkara would continue to play Test cricket, while Jayawardene, who had already given up the Test, could only score four runs
 isse pehle srilankai captain angelo maithyuj ne aaj toss jitkar ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya, jo galat sabit hua
 Two of his batsmen had returned to the pavilion on the score of four runs
 sangakaara ne sarvaadhik 45 ran banaae, lekin iske liye unhone 96 gendon kaa saamana kiya or sirf teen chauke jade
 He shared a 65-run partnership for the third wicket with Lahiru Tirimanne (41)
 esasiji kii pich par inke alaava srilanka kaa koi ballebaaj nahin tik sakaa
 The last two World Cup runners-up and the 1996 champions team lost four wickets within nine balls and two runs and their score was 116 for eight

 In-form Tillakaratne Dilshan faced seven balls, but could not open the account

 sabase pehle 33wein over main unhone maithyuj ko out kiya or phir 35wein over main kulshekhara or kushal ko pavilion bheja
 He became the ninth bowler to score a hat-trick in the World Cup
 pakistan ke sakalen mushtak (1999) ke baad vah yah karnama karne vaale pehle spinner hai
 Tahir, meanwhile, added to Sri Lanka's problems by sending Tisara Perera to the pavilion
 barish ke kaaran khel rukne se pehle sangakaara tej gendbaaj morni morkal kii gend par deep therdman main kaich dekar laute
 a few minutes later, Tahir dismissed Lasith Malinga when the game was restored
 ham nahin jaanate the tamilnadu ke dharmpuri jile ke naikencottai ke rahane vaale ilavarsan ko
 Then, like so many of us, he gave heart and he became famous
 yaa ki kuch logon ke liye badnaam ho gaya
 It depends on which side of the partition you are
 vibhaajan, kaisaa vibhaajan? ham sab to ekajute hai, ham main koi matbhed nahin
 Yes, sometimes some deaths suddenly bring an easily visible division in our perspective, whose scope is very large
 kaash ham is sab kaa dosha aadhunik, uttar-aadhunik chizon yaa ab puraane ho chuke globaligeshan par madh pate
 But there is no way to escape here
 jati, is ek shabd se ham nahin batch sakate
 Its dominance is over everything in India
 par hamen lagata he yaa bataaya jaataa he ki aazaadee ke 65 saal baad jati dharashayi ho chuki he
 e Ilavarsan was a Dalit
 pichley buudhvaar ko dharmpuri kii railway line par uski laash mili
 It took a while for the news to reach the national level
 isse pehle uski patni divya ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki vah kabhi apane pati ke paas waapas nahin jaaegi or maa ke paas hi rahegi
 19-year-old Ilavarasan fell in love with Divya
 22 saal kii divya vanniar (obisi) varg se aati thi
 The two married on 14 October 2012
 dharm pyaar kii jubaan nahin samajhataa
 Especially in relation to interracial weddings
 tabaahi ke chhinte divya ke parivaar tak bhi pahunche
 After the marriage of both, his father committed suicide
 jile bhar main daliton kii kareeb 300 jhopadiyaan jala di gayi
 Tamil Nadu political party Pattali Makkal Kachi (PMK) is dominated by Vanniyars
 ise es ramdaas ne sthapit kiya tha, jinke bete ambumani ramdaas purv kendriya mantri rahe
 There is also a party of Dalits, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Kachi
 iske netaa hai tii thirumavalwan
 He is the only Tirumavalavan who came out in the CBSE books to protest against Ambedkar's objectionable cartoons
 police yah kahati rahi ki ilavarsan ne khudakushi kar lee, par uske parivaar ko kuch or shaq he
 His parents say that his son had every hope of returning to his estranged wife
 kaam se baahar jane ke liye usne apane pita ke atm card se paise bhi nikaale the
 Police say he has recovered photographs of Divya from the body and three letters sent to her in 2011
 jile bhar main police tainaat he, lekin vibhaajan ke donon ore bheeshan aag lagi hui he
 It is a long dark night for Dharmapuri and both communities
 ilavarsan ek or sankhya main tabdeel ho gaya he
 Probably as a memorial to the caste war
 jati, jisaki puure desh kii tarah tamilnadu main bhi tuuti bolti he
 But, in a hidden form
 ilaake main tanaav raajnneetik vajahon se upja he
 PMK is a fast-paced party
 2011 main eidiemke ke satta main aane ke baad usne diemke kaa daaman chhod diya tha
 She may be a 'party in demand' ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 lihaaja, vanniaron ko phaayde mil saktaa he
 The Congress had no permanent state president in Haryana for three years
 jab party adhyaksh phoolchand mulaanaa ne istipha diya to party se puraane style main unke istife kii manjuuri yaa naamanzoori par kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 When Mulana continued to work despite having practically no authority, Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda thought that he would conduct the election show there
 lekin achaanak farvari main rahul gandhi ke gut ke ashok tanvar ko party adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Therefore, instead of electoral campaign, the Congress fight was reduced to Hooda vs Tanwar
 maharashtra kii kahani isse alag he
 It was believed that Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan did not have much political capacity
 lekin asal main unki khwaahish nae maratha netaa ke taur par ubharne kii thi
 This clearly meant reducing the power of Sharad Pawar and NCP
 isliye gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke bich ladaai chhid gai or gathbandhan tut gaya
 Rahul did not show interest in taking forward the partnership with NCP and the situation in Maharashtra worsened
 sharad pavaar bhi ensipi ko choti party ke bataur praasangik banaae rakhane ke liye congress se alag ho gaye
 On the other hand, Mohan Prakash, another supporter of Rahul, took over the command of Maharashtra from Delhi as party general secretary-in-charge of Maharashtra
 halaat tab or ulajh gaye jab sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel taqatvar ashok chavaan ke samarthan main aa gaye
 In spite of the reluctance of aggressive campaigns in both states, Rahul and his team strengthened their position in the strategy of these elections and made effective and important decisions
 un faislon ne apeksha ke anuroop nattejey nahin die
 In Maharashtra, it quickly turned its back on the NCP, while in Haryana, Tanwar's ambition was to strengthen himself
 isse bhi bura yah ki unhone sthaneey congress sanghathanon ko bhang kar diya
 That is, the party organizers in the district and the blocks were practically non-existent during the entire campaign
 nattejey iskaa khulaasa karte hai kyonki unke kai ummidavaar to tisare number par bhi nahin rahe
 In many ways, like the Lok Sabha elections, once again Rahul failed to show courage against the officials and satraps in both Haryana and Maharashtra
 unke ummidavaar ummiido par khare nahin utre jo congress ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii ranneeti par sawaal uthaata he
 The most damaging party was his vague action plan
 na to ve haryana main hooda ko chhod paae or na hi maharashtra main ensipi ke alag hone ke baad koi vaikalpik yojana bana paae
 Even now his supporters have not given up
 tanvar party main peedigat badlaav chaahate hai, ‘‘party main nae chehron ko zyada pratinidhitiv or jimmedaari dene kii jarurat he
 Senior leaders are taking precautions
 party mahasachiv digvijay singh kehete hai, ‘‘campan thik he, par rahul ko logon ke bich najar aana chahie
 They should continuously visit parts of the country and join Twitter and other social media platforms to connect with the youth
 ’’ab congress kii vaapasi is baat par nirbhar he ki rahul madhyasthon kii niyukti kii bajaae buniyaad ko kaise majboot banaate hai
 Janardan Dwivedi says, "we have to ask ourselves where we made a mistake
 hamen is nazariye se baahar aana hoga ki congress kii niyati raaj karne kii he
 "this is the time for Rahul to find the right answers to these questions
" cabinet mantriyon ke pradarshan kaa aankalan karne ke vastut: prayaas ke tahat pradhanmantri karyaalay ne filon ko aage badhaane ke bare main byoraa maanga he
 Specifically, details of how long the file was pending in their offices have been sought
 kai mantralayon dwaara ise cabinet main pherbadal ke pehle kii kavayad ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The cabinet reshuffle is likely to take place after the presidential election

 The PMO wanted to know through this how much time the files were approved
 saath hi un filon kaa byoraa bhi maanga gaya he jo 31 may tak lambit thim
 It is understood that the Prime Minister has given this instruction in the recent cabinet meeting, after which its forms were sent to the ministers concerned

 It has various sub-titles such as opening balance, files found during the period, total files, settlement, pending files at the end of the period and breakup of pending files
 lambit filon ke brallep ko phir 15 din, 15 din se ek maheenaa or ek maheenaa se teen maheene main baanta gaya he 
 The PMO has also sought action report on the letters which were written to the Prime Minister on his e-mail ID YPMOK Public Grievance Portal or his office and sent to the concerned ministries

 When the Railways did not take action, then on June 1, the campaign was renewed
 deshbhar se hajaaron log muhim se jude or isi kaa nateeja he ki railway ko bhi neend se jaagnaa padaa
 Through the sting operation on Aaj Tak, it was shown how large scale railway tickets are being rigged

 Along with this, the face of those brokers were also shown who are taking advantage of the immediate service in connivance with booking clerk

 shimla ke vivaadit gudiya gangrape maamle main guuruuvaar ko ek nayaa mode aa gaya
 Sentry posted at Kotkhai police station in Shimla gave such a statement to the CBI that SP DW Negi himself had reached behind bars
 darasal, thane main tainaat dinesh sharma naam ke santari ne shimla police ke bade adhikariyon kii pole khol di he
 According to sources, when the sentry told the CBI that Raju, the alleged gangrape accused in front of his eyes in the police lockup, did not kill the second accused Suraj, then the false story of the police did not take long
 sutron ke mutabik suraj kii hatya pulicekarmiyon ne hi kii thi or baad main uskaa aarope raju ke sir madh diya
 Suraj was murdered somewhere else outside the police station, not in the police station
 uske postmortem main khulaasa hua tha ki use maarane se pehle buree tarah peeta gaya tha or uske sir or guptang par chot ke nishaan the
 Sentry on duty had told the CBI that he was stationed at the police station on the night of the murder
 suraj kii hatya lowep main nahin hui balki dspi manoj joshi usase poochtacha ke liye lowep se baahar kahin duusari jagah le gaye the
 That is, the policemen took Suraj to death somewhere and then killed Raju by naming him a mutual rivalry, which was locked in lockup
 sutron ke mutabik santari dinesh sharma ne CBI ko bataaya tha ki bade police adhikariyon ne doshi police waalon ko bachaane ke liye usase jabaran bayaan likhvaya tha ki aaropee raju ne suraj kii hatya uske saamne kii
 According to sources, after Suraj's murder, DSP Manoj Joshi reached Shimla and met SP SP DW Negi and IG Zahoor Zaidi secretly
 yani shimla ke aalaa police afasar suraj kii maut kaa raaj jaanate the or police waalon ko bachaane ke liye unhone hi juthi FIR darj karwaai thi
 The real culprits of the much talked-about doll gang rape case of Shimla are still out of the custody of the police
 ab tak is maamle main kul 9 police adhikari or karmchaaree giraftaar ho chuke hai

 duusari taraf raina ne apni aakshark pari main 228 gend kheli tathaa 12 chauke or do chakke lagaaye
 Raina returned to the pavilion after making an easy catch to Kumar Sangakkara at midwicket in an attempt to drive on the same bowler after hitting a boundary in the cover area off Ajanta Mendis
 bharat ne subah chaar wicket par 382 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya
 Tendulkar led his innings by 108 runs and gave a good view of crass and artistic shots
 unhone dhammika prasad or dilhara furnando ko vishesh nishaanaa banaaya
 His shot on the fine leg of Fernando's 147 km ball was very attractive
 raina bhi gendbaajon par haaavee hone main peeche nahin rahe
 Short pitch balls have been considered Raina's weakness, and Fernando has tested him with consecutive rising balls
 raina ne kai short pich gend khubsuurati se chodi jabaki isi tarah kii gend par extra cover or midaaf ke bich se jaandaar chaukaa bhi jamaaya
 He hit Suraj Randiv, playing his first match, for the first six of the day in the long off field and then sent the same bowler's ball at midwicket for six runs

 tendulkar ne dhoni ke saath chathe wicket ke liye 95 ran kii saajhedaari kii

 Dhoni was also dismissed by Dilshan who was then easily scoring and scoring a century
 dhoni ne unki oochaal leti gend par par drive karne main jaldbaaji dikhaayi lekin waapas gendbaaj ko aasaan kaich de baithe
 His 138-ball innings included seven fours
 mithun or ishanth ne pichley match main bhi apane ballebaaji kaushal kaa najaara pesh kiya tha or guuruuvaar ko bhi unhone gendbaajon ko khaas pareshaan kiya
 Mithun scored the highest score of his career before being bowled by Mendis, while Ishant has scored ten runs in 40 balls

 For many urban people, the village is a sick child, who has been cured since going to the government hospitals of the schemes
 bahut se logon ke liye gaanv puraani yaadon kii vah basti he, jahaan sabakuch vaisaa hi he jaisaa vah chhod aae the
 Whose wind does not come from anywhere, but it is born and consumed
 jahaan kaa ghi kabhi kharaab nahin hota or sabzi bina rasayan ke ug jaati he
 The schemes run from Delhi carry the name of the Prime Minister, but take away their burden as soon as they reach the village head
 dilli har gaanv ke liye sapana dekhati he or har gaanv dilli kaa rasta
 By the time a plan reaches the village, the village man takes the Delhi Mumbai train
 in tamaam niraashaaon ke bich pradhanmantri ne 15 agast ko laal kile kii pracheer se adarsh gram yojana kaa elaan kiya tha, jise jepi kii jayanti yani 11 aktubar ko launch kar diya gaya
 The Prime Minister had said that every MP will have to build three model villages by 2019
 pehla gaanv 2016 tak ban janaa chahie or 2019 se 24 tak 5 or gaanv ban jane chahien
 Accordingly, 6433 villages will become ideal within ten years
 bharat main chah lakh se zyada gaanv hai
 That is, in ten years, only around one percent of villages will become ideal
 pradhanmantri kaa makasad he ki baaki gaanv inase seekhenge
 Before the rest of the village began to learn that a leader had chosen a village with majority of his caste, someone selected a village which does not have a single Muslim
 samvidhan ke aadarshon ke khilaaf jaakar bhedbhaav ke adarsh kii khabaren aane lageen
 If the rest of the village does not learn all this, it would be good, because a written objective of Adarsh village is also to ensure social harmony and justice there
 pehali baar kisi yojana ke chayan ke liye aisi catagori bani ki gaanv sasuraal or maayke kaa nahin hona chahie
 Otherwise there may be a danger of Mulayam Singh Yadav of these villages being underdeveloped like Saifai
 to adarsh gram yojana kii shart simpal he, saansad koi bhi gram panchayat chun sakate hai apana or apane pati-patni kaa gaanv chhodkar
 The village should have a population of 3000–5000
 pahari ilaakon ke liye 1000−3000 honi chahie
 Such a criterion was created that only Sitaab Diara, the village of Jayaprakash Narayan, got out
 jinaki jayanti par ye yojana hui unka gaanv aabaadi ke kaaran adarsh gram ke rup main nahin chunaa ja sakaa
 The Prime Minister's speech at the launch of the Adarsh gram Yojana and a forty-page guideline booklet www
 saanjhi
 gov
 in par maujuud he
 There are more than 80 types of work in the agenda
 itane kaam hai ki saansad mahoday ko duusare gaanv main chaay pine kaa bhi time nahin milegaa
 How can they refuse the invitation for marriage and Shraddha? maine apane hisaab se guidelins se kuch kaa chayan kiya he
 The village development is divided into four parts under the Adarsh gram Yojana
 vaiyaktik, maanav, aarthiki or saamaajik
 Under personal development, the habit of cleaning will be developed
 dainik vyaayaam honge
 Will be taught to bathe daily and clean teeth
 maanav vikaas ke tehat sabhi ko buniyadi swasthya sevaayen milengi, linganupaat santulit kiya jayega
 Schools will be smart and at least tenth pass will be educated
 saamaajik vikaas ke tahat ek aisa gramin geet bananaa hoga, jisase logon main garv kii bhaavana panape gram diwas mane,ga anusuchit jati janajati ko gaanvon main samaveshan ke liye sakriy upaay kiye jaaenge
 Under economic development, soil health card, seed bank will be established, cow dung bank, cattle hostel will be formed
 guideline kii hindi dekhakar laga ki sabase pehle adarsh sarkari hindi yojana launch honi chahie
 In Adarsh gram, there will be regular Gram Sabha and Mahila Sabha and Bal Sabha
 guidelins ke hisaab se adarsh gram kaa lakshya saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita javabdehi or eemaandaaree ko badhaava dena he or aatmavishvaas kii bhaavana utpann karnaa he
 This scheme promoting honesty should also be implemented in political parties
 hamaare sahyogi himanshu shekhar mishra ne jaankaree jutai he ki saansad adarsh gram yojana ke liye 11 aktubar se 11 november ke bich adarsh gram kaa chayan ho janaa chahie tha, lekin donon sadanon ke 206 saansadon ne abhi tak adarsh gram kii pahchaan nahin kii he
 The Prime Minister had said at the launch of this scheme that we want the scheme to be built in villages and come to Delhi
 lekin jab aap guidelins padhenge to usamen dilli ne gaanvon ke liye kam hi gunzaaish chodi he
 So the mps have raised questions for fear of working or indeed they have legitimate questions about where the money will come from
 praathmik chikitsa dene ke liye doctor kahaan se aaenge? maveshi hostel kii ruparekha kya hogi? It has been written in the guidelines that the resources of the Center and other schemes of the states will have to be used
 privet companiyon ke saamaajik fund se paise jutaney honge
 The money of MP fund can also be used for this
 virdohi dal ke saansad isse santusht nahin hai
 Earlier, in 2009–10, the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh gram Yojana was made, under which villages were to be selected which had more than fifty percent Dalit population
 pehle charan main ise kai rajyon ke ek hazaar gaanvon kaa chayan hua
 i don't know whether he should become the ideal
 vah yojana samaapt ho gai yah bhi nahin maaloom

 agar aap yuva hai or fishan parast hai to yakeenan aapane 'superman' kii signechar tii-shart pahani hogi

 In fact, in the last one year, the identity of the Aam Aadmi Party has developed into a new experiment on the political plank of the country and as a party with a different stream
 party kii shuruyaat or ab tak kii safalataa main ek bada yogadan yuvaaon or soshal netwarking site kaa bhi rahaa he
 In such a situation, just before the election, some youths have made up their mind to connect people with the party's ideology through a website named 'kranti - Wear the Change'

 The Supreme Court's stand on black money forced the government not to make only a few names public and now all the names are with the court
 lekin ye chunavi naaraa ab bhi janata ke sir par chadh kar bol rahaa he or yah badi charchaa kaa vishay he
 But is it so easy to bring back black money deposited in foreign banks? If it were so, when would this money be returned
 aapke saamne kuch sachai rakhana chahta hum ki sach kya he or prachaar kya
 There are about 150 names in this list who have given tax and hence no action is made against them
 yani jitna sarkaar kii jeb main aana tha aa gaya
 Now there is no point in revealing these names
 haa agar in logon ko badnaam karnaa he to baat kuch or he
 Of these 627 names, 577 remain
 adhiktar khaaton main 40−50 karod rupee hai
 Some have 500 to 1000 crores, but they belong to trusts operating from tax-exempt countries
 iskar vibhaag ke liye pataa karnaa mushkil he ki in treston kaa laabh kin logon ko mil rahaa he
 These are in tax-exempt countries from where money has been deposited by creating a fake company or trust
 agar puri list se kar chori kii kul rakam nikaali jaae to vah 1000 karod tak nikalati he, jo jurmaana lagaakar 3,000 karod ho sakati he, lekin ye 3000 karod rakam hasil karnaa bhi itnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 In response to the Income Tax Department, more than 120 people have denied having any account abroad
 ye pataa lagaana aasaan nahin he ki ye sach bol rahe hai yaa nahin
 Because India got its name from the governments of France and Germany
 iske alaava bhartiya afasaron ke paas jo list he, vah chori kii he
 It is collected by bribing the bank employee
 kanoon kii nigaah main uski koi manyata nahin he
 Banks are not going to prove their names in this list
 videshi khaaton kii baat nakaarne waalon se iskar vibhaag bas halafanaame le paa rahaa he
 In some cases, the names are not their accounts
 is chori kii list ke boote iskar vibhaag talaashi jurmaane yaa zabti kaa kaam nahin kar saktaa
 This is not only difficult in this case
 duusare deshon se jo samjhaute hai, unki vajah se bhi iskar vibhaag ke haath bandhe hue hai
 The agreement between India and Switzerland has agreed to disclose the name only after 2011, with no previous details
 vahiin france ne suchi saajha karte hue ye samjhauta kiya tha ki iskar vibhaag ye naam kisi duusare vibhaag ko nahin de saktaa, yani pravartan nideshaalay tak ko nahin
 Therefore, the Income Tax Department can issue notices and summons only
 france, switzaraland or jamarni ke saath hue samjhauton ke mutabik sirf adaalat hi naam ujagar kar sakati hai, sarkarein nahin
 At present, India is trying to get the names of more foreign account holders
 aise main kisi samjhaute kaa ulanghan puri koshish ko khatai main daal saktaa he
 Actually it is clear that the matter of bringing back black money deposited in foreign banks is not as easy and attractive as our leaders had made in the election campaign
 Shayani Ekadashi 2019: manyata he ki Devshayani Ekadashi (devshayni ekadshi) ke din bhagwaan vishnu chaar maheene kii nidra main chale jate hai
 There are no auspicious activities like weddings, christening, janeu, planet entry and shaving during this entire four months

 Manglik works in Hinduism begin once again from this day onwards
 yahaan aap jaaniye ki aakhir kyon bhagwaan vishnu chaar maheene kii nidra main chale jate hai
 Know the worship method of Devshayani Ekadashi and according to the fast story Kathawaman Purana, the king of the Asuras, Bali had captured all the three worlds with his strength and might
 raja bali ke aadhipaty ko dekhakar indra devtaa ghabaraakar bhagwaan vishnu ke paas madad maangane pahunche
 Hearing the call of the gods, Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar and the king arrived to beg Bali
 vaaman bhagwaan ne bali se teen pag bhoomi maangi
 In the first and second steps, God measured the earth and the sky
 ab teesraa pag rakhane ke liye kuch bachaa nahin thi to raja bali ne kaha ki teesraa pag unke sir par rakh den
 Lord Vapana did the same
 is tarah devataaon kii chintaa khatm ho gai
 At the same time, Lord King was very happy with the sacrifice of Bali
 unhone raja bali se vardaan maangane ko kaha to bali ne unase pataal main basane kaa var maang liya
 God had to go to hell to fulfill the will of the sacrifice
 bhagwaan vishnu ke pataal jane ke baad sabhi devatagan or mata lakshmi chintit ho gaye
 In order to bring back her husband Lord Vishnu, Mother Lakshmi became a poor woman and came to King Bali and tied Rakhi by making her her brother
 badale main bhagwaan vishnu ko pataal lok se waapas le jane kaa vachan le liya
 While leaving from Patala, Lord Vishnu granted a boon to King Bali that he would reside in the Hades from Ekadashi of Ashadh Shukla Paksha to Ekadashi of Kartik Shukla Paksha
 pataal lok main unke rahane kii is avadhi ko yoganidra mana jaataa he
 Akali dal-bjp has promoted scams, scams and corruption

 He said that if the government of Punjab comes to the state, basic care will be given more attention in the border area and the land will be given compensation at the rate of 25 thousand per acre

 After that it can go up to $ 1,300 an ounce

 pehle tii-20 match main jis tarah se dakshin africa team haari
 Seeing that it can be said that Team India will also take possession of the T20 series in the ODI
 is match main gabbar (shikhar dhawan) kaa balla khub garja
 Due to which India scored a mountain like score of 203 runs
 johanisburg main phir dahaada hindustandarasal pehle tii-20 match shikhar dhawan team india kii jai-jayakaar kaa koi mauka nahin chook rahe the, unhone kamjor gendon kaa intjaar hi nahin kiya
 By making big shots in small format, in the first T20, he made all the arrangements to light South Africa
 maidan ke saare kone unke shots se gulzaar the, tabhi to powerple main team india ne 78 ran jamaa daale jo bharat ke tii 20 itihaas kaa sabase zyada powerple score he
 Dhawan scored 72 runs off 39 balls
 ek chor par lagaataar kuch ranon ke antaraal par wicket gir rahe the, duusare chor par shikhar dhawan africa gendbaajon ko apane shandaar shots se pareshaan kar rahe the
 Dhawan scored 10 fours and 2 sixes in an innings of 72 runs
 gabbar kii neenv se 204 ranon kaa targetshikhar kii dhamaakedaar ballebaaji ne team india ke bade score kii neenv jis andaaj main rakhi, usase naa sirf dakshin africa ke kheme main maayusi chaa gai balki middle order ke ballebaaj bhi buland hausalon ke saath maidan par aae
 Virat Kohli scored 26 runs, while Manish Pandey scored 29 not out
 is tejatarraar ballebaaji kaa hi nateeja tha ki team india ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf 203 ran kaa bada score bana daalaa
 The victory for South Africa was not easy as Bhuvi's bowling bowled 203 runs on the board
 204 ran kaa lakshya ko bhedane africa ballebaaj maidan par to utre
 But he never looked back in the match
 kyonki bhartiya raftaar bhubaneshwar kumaar ne africa ballabaajon ko krij par tikne hi nahin diya
 One by one, Bhuvi showed the five batsmen the path of the pavilion
 ham kah sakate hai ki shikhar dhawan ne tabadatod ballebaaji karke to bhubaneshwar kumaar ne 5 wicket jhatak kar team india kii jeet sunishchit kar di
 And then Kohli's army won the T20 before 28 runs
 isi ke saath bharat ne 3 maichon kii siries main 1-0 se badhat bhi bana lee he

 This is the first time in the history of Hindi news channel, when a special program has been prepared about the celebrities related to music
 ye pahal kii he desh ke number van news channel aaj tak ne
 Till date, last week has started a full journey every Saturday night at 8 o'clock, which is a melodious thing
 is program main sangeet kii hastiyon se unki jindagi ke safar par, unki sangeet kii shuruaati talim par baat karti hai india today group ke life style section kii sioo or mujeec today kii head maala sekhri
 We learned from Mala Sekhari about the concept of this show, how the program is so far different from other TV programs made on the music field celebrities and what rhythm and rhythm will be seen in it
 kaise aayaa sureeli baat kaa khyalalife style section head kar rahi hum barason se
 During this time many singers had to meet with composers
 mujeec today kii mukhiya hone ke naate bhi kai shastreey, lok or filmi sangeetkaaron or gayakon se baat mulaakaat hoti thi
 Many of these are my good friends
 jab bhi ye milte hai, main ek cheez notice karti
 My other friends would have known him through songs just by his personality
 ye kuch yun hota ki are sahab aapane wo line kya gajab gaai he
 Just lukewarm once
 yaa kya dhun banaai he
 Where did it come from? magar mere khyaal main ye baat ai ki ye jo gayak hai, sangeetkaar hai inkaa gaanaa, inkaa sangeet to sab dekhte sunate hai, magar jinhen dekh sunakar ye bade hue, bane, is makaam tak pahunche, uske bare main kahin jaankaree nahin milti
 This was the beginning of the melodious talk, this new thought
 singer ga rahaa he dusron ke ganesurili baat main hamane koshish kii ki jo mehmaan aae hai
 Talk about his childhood, his early preparations and the songs he listened to on the radio, on TV or on tape recorders
 yahaan ye saaf tha ki singer yaa compoger do katigari main aate hai
 One is like Shafakat, belonging to the family
 bachapan se hi ustad kii sangat main kathor riyaj karte
 Others are K
 ke
 Or like Sunidhi
 normal middle class family main bhai bahanon ke saath rahete or sun sunakar sikhte
 So this was the order of learning, it was very important to know it and in terms of audience, if you think something fresh
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ham sureeli baat main na sirf gayakon se unke bachapan, shuruaati riyaj ke bare main puch rahe hai
 Rather, they are also listening to the songs which they sung
 ye bahut alag he
 Sing Shan Kishore song or sing Sunidhi Lata ji
 isse us jehan, us vakt kii ek tasviir saamne aati he, jab hamaare aaj ke singing super star taiyaar ho rahe the
 When he kept a tape or record with the same way, he handled, listened, like a child to another toy
 bike ko yaa favorit gajet ko rakhega
 What is the point of the matter, the only thing that the audience will note in Hussurili Baat is that neither the singers nor the anchor expressions will be seen here
 ye najar nahin aaenge kyonki set par yaa shoot ke dauraan kuch bhi nakli nahin hota
 That is why neither the location of the camera is taken care of, nor is it that the interviewer usually does not sit on the songs sitting there
 ye baat he, aamane saamne kii eemaandaar baat, gaanon, sangeet se saji
 In such a situation, if you move on a song, then you have to see it
 isiilie sureeli baat main candid moments kii bharmaar he
 There is a clap
 sukhwinder masti se bharpoor shararti ladke sa he(maala sekhri ne saajha kiya pehle apisod kaa anubhav, jisamen mehmaan the sukhwinder singh)kamaal kaa tha ye pehla apisod sukhwinder ke saath
 He came for the shoot and smiled and said, how are you
 mujhe laga ki ye to pakkaa punjabi he
 big hearted
 laud or khush mizaaj
 If you look closely, you will see that Sukhwinder has fun in the eyes
 har expressant vahaan najar aata he
 90 per cent of it is also fun
 matlab ye kuch vaisaa hi atitute he ki main mast hum yaar
 i am happy with my life, work mujhe kis baat kaa dikhaava karnaa
 And the same feeling kept getting dense in my mind during the three hours of shooting of the episode
 kya hua shoot ke dauraanbaatcheet hui
 The songs were done
 jokes hue
 Everything was very fun
 mujhe kabhi nahin laga ki wo apni koi khaas chhavi banane kii yaa bani hui chhavi ko pukhta karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 He was very comfortable in what he was
 kapade, bal, baatcheet persenality
 it is what it is
 ye nahin tha ki mujhe aisa hona chahie, vaisaa hona chahie
 His account is very clear
 ye meraa mujeec he, aisi meri persenality he, aap aapako jo poochna he puuchhie
 But the spice of fun is also mixed with this cleanliness
 sukhwinder ko baat karne ke dauraan jaise hi mauka milegaa, wo mazaakia andaaj apana legaa
 The jock will stain
 shoot main bhi yahi ho rahaa tha
 i also told him that you are a brat
 or wo hansate hue bolaa ki haa, main to hum
 The good thing is that Sukhwinder has no hesitation
 aap jo kaho ga degaa
 Then in the middle of the shoot, he started saying, "oh, you have lost anything
" aapane meraa mood is baatcheet se itnaa acha kar diya
 There was a variety of energy during this interview
 main jab shoot ke baad ghar gai to lag rahaa tha ki aaj ek nae achche shaks se mili
 With whom it was nice to talk

 After all, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley broke the silence on Sushma Swaraj and said that Sushma Swaraj did exactly what she did

 Gambhir, while challenging the system, wrote that if you have the courage, then show it by holding the arrahas
 gambhir ne iske baad kathua main 8 saal kii bacchee kaa cese lard rahi deepika singh rajaavat ke paksh main likhte hue likhaa ki un vakeelon par shame aa rahi he jo deepika kaa virodh kar rahe hai

 Meaning votes have been cast in five states

 One thing that has come out in the survey is that the Aam Aadmi Party has done the work of cutting the votes of Congress rather than BJP
 agsit pole ke anusaar, is baar shila dikshit apni seat bhi bachaa nahin paaengi
 Let us tell you that Sheila Dixit is contesting from New Delhi and Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party is contesting against them

 matlab kul 70 siton vaali vidhansabha main bijepi ko spasht bahumat milegaa
 At the same time, Congress is getting only 20 seats
 congress ko 23 siton kaa nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 In this election, 'aam Aadmi Party' has been the most discussed
 is agsit pole ke aankade arvind kejariwal kii party ko 6 siten dilaa rahe hai
 However Arvind Kejriwal is beating Sheila Dixit

 If you want to see Harshvardhan as CM, then the current CM Sheila Dixit wants to make 29 percent of the people CM
 vahiin arvind kejariwal ke saath 25 pratishat log hai
 If we talk about only New Delhi seat then 35 percent of the people there want to see Arvind Kejriwal as the Chief Minister
 iske baad shila dikshit ke saath 33 pratishat vot hai or tisare number par harshavardhan kaa naam aata he
 27 percent people agree with the name of Harshvardhan
 survey ke aankadon ke aadhaar par philhal ban rahi sthiti-dilli kii kul siten- 70bijepi - 2008 main 23 siten, is baar 41 (18 kaa laabh) kaa anumaancongress - 2008 main 43 siten, is baar 20 (23 kaa nuksaan) kaa anumaanam aadmi party - pehali baar chunaav lard rahi he, 6 seat aane kaa anumaancongress kaa vot pratishat bhi is baar kaaphi girtaa najar aa rahaa he
 According to the survey, last time their percentage was 40, then this time it can come down to 30 percent
 bijepi ko bhi ek pratishat vot kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Is this Modi's fire? If the results are according to this exit then it will be very easy to say that it is Narendra Modi's fire

 One such case has come up in Kishanganj district of Bihar
 whatsapeper aapattijanak post daalane ke jurm main police ne post daalane vaale ke saath-saath group admin ko bhi giraftaar kar jail bhej diya
 a government employee of Kishanganj had put an objectionable post in a group called 'kishanganj Ki Awaaz'
 uske baad police ne railway karmchaaree santosh singh ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Later, police also arrested the group administrator Sumit Raj

 Bloody war between saints and saints has become common in Dharmanagri Haridwar
 yah jang yahaan ke 13 akhaadon kii hajaaron acre bhoomi, sampatti or darjanon math-mandiron main aane vaale chadhaave ko lekar ho rahi he
 So far 29 Mahants have been killed in this bloody battle in the last five years
 lekin police ke haath inamen se sirf chaar hatyaon kaa suraag haath laga he or usne in hatyaon main shaamil vyaktiyon ko pakadaa he
 The killer who was arrested by the police for the murder of Mahant Sudhir Giri, has been described as a property dealer
 haridwar ke samajasevi je
 P
 badoni kehete hai, ''haridwar main akhaadon or math-mandiron kii bhoomi ko avaidh rup se bechney kaa silsilaa bahut purana he
 There are also murders related to the purchase and sale of this land
 " ve bataate hai ki shraddhaluon ne 13 akhaadon ko alag-alag samay main hajaaron acre bhoomi daan main di, jinka koi vyavsaayik prayog nahin kiya janaa chahie tha
 But the opposite happened
 sanathan dharm ke prachaar-prasar kii bajaae akhaadon kii is jameen par vyavsaayik nirmaan ho rahaa he or ye munafa kamaane ke thikaanon main tabdeel ho rahe hai
 Says Badoni, "the whole battle is about this profit
 "akhaadon kii jameen par aaj bade-bade guest house, hotel or apartment khadey ho gaye hai
 Commercial complexes have also been formed within many akharas
 haalanki jahaan bhi inhen hotel kaa rup diya gaya he, vahaan ise sevasadan yaa ashram kaa naam dekar sarkaar ko rajasav dene se bachane kaa khel khelaa ja rahaa he
 From the donated land, a guest house is built on the land of Juna Akhara located in the commercial interest of Haridwar
 yah jameen saîkaaron or dharm-premiyon ne daan main di thi
 The motive was that sadhus, pilgrims and pilgrims coming from all over the country could stay free of charge
 lekin yahaan bana guest house commercial he
 It is given on rent
 shri dutt atithigrih bhi isi tarah kaa maamla he
 In front of the Mayadevi temple of Juna Akhara, there is a multi-storey apartment on the land of charity
 is apartment main logon ko kiraye par makaan die gaye hai
 The tenancy of these houses is a lifespan and for this, lakhs of rupees are unclaimed from the tenants
 inaki na to registry kii jaati he, na hi sampatti transfar hoti he
 If the tenant wants to give this property to someone, then the Mahant of the arena has to get the tenant, in which the Mahant again takes a few lakh rupees and gives the new tenancy
 isse sarkaar kaa rajasav maaraa jaataa he
 This dispute is also in this apartments
 kankhal ke mahanirvaani akhaade kii sampatti ko bhi khurd-burd karne kii koshish kaa virodh karne par hi mahant sudhir giri kii hatya hui thi, haalanki hatyara baad main pakad liya gaya
 Most of the flats are named Manorampuram in Muhalla Mayana of Kanakhal itself
 yahaan ke udasin akhaada par bhi commercial flats banane or kai kirayedaron se moti rakam anthne ke aarope hai
 (the multi-storey building being built on the land of Niranjani Akhara in Haridwar) Earned money for religious work, although the Mahants of the Akhada categorically deny such allegations
 unke apane tark hai
 For example, the secretary of the apathetic arena, Mangaldar, denies the allegations related to the commercial flat being built in Kankhal, saying, "the construction of the flat on the land of the arena is still going on
" unhen bechney kii baat galat he
 Mahant Bhagatram Ji can tell how we rent them
 " lekin mahant bhagatraam koi tippanee karne ke liye kabhi uplabdh hi nahin hote
 Similarly, Mahant Premanand Giri of Juna Akhara says, "wherever hotels or guest houses are built on the land of ashrams or akharas, the monks of the akhara are served by their income
 bhukhe, laachaar or garibon ko akhaade se jude ashramon main sahaara diya jaataa he
 "premanand Giri states that earlier the king-maharaja served the Sadhus and gave them financial help
 ab to akhaadon ko sab kuch swayan karnaa he
 They say, "yes, we are earning money, but we are spending that money only in religion
" isamen buraai kya he?"bade-bade apartment banaakar unhen kiraye par dene main moti pagadi vasuulne kaa aay-vyay kaa puraa hisaab kahaan darj hota he? yadi nahin to kyon? premanand giri se jab india today ne is sambandh main sawaal poocha to ve bole, ''mere paas saare sawaalon ke jawaab hai, lekin philhal main trayambakeshwar main kumbh kii taiyaariyon main vyast hum
 "exemption in the name of religion
 Mahantamleshwar of the Akharas, using his भाव Bhava, gets the city authority to pass big maps in his akharas as Dharamshala or Ashram
 phir in kathith ashramon or dharmashalaon main logon se moti pagadi vasuulakar inhen kiraye par laga diya jaataa he
 The major 13 akharas, which have thousands of acres of land in Haridwar, also have large plots of pilgrimage centers across the country such as Vrindavan, Ujjain, Gaya, Kuruhnetra, Allahabad, Nashik, Ayodhya etc
 haridwar main akhaade hai or rishikesh main dharmashalaayein
 Managers posted as care takers here have allegedly sold the land at a paltry price, whether it is Kali Kamali Wala's Dharamshala or Punjab Sindh area's Dharamshala or Garib Das Ji's Dharamshala
 isse pradesh sarkaar ko rajasav kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or registry shulk ke rup main vasule jane vaale rajasav kii bhi haani hui
 The development fee received by Haridwar Development Authority is also waived through this
 khel yaheen khatm nahin hota
 Dharamshalas and ashrams get an exemption on electric water connections
 haridwar ke artiai kaaryakarta ajay sharma kehete hai, ''akhaadon main ashram or dharmashalaon ke naam par bane hotalon ko theke par diya gaya he
 Not only this, big shopping malls are made here and shops charge a hefty fare
 "(kankhal main bade akhaade kii jameen par khadey apartment)police kii sust bhoomikaitne bade paimaane par dhaandhlee chal rahi he, lekin police or prashasan shant kyon he? gadhwal parikshetra ke police upmahanireekshak sanjay gunjyaal bataate hai ki unke haridwar ke esaspi rahane ke dauraan un vivaadit treston or ashramon ko soochibaddh kiye jane kaa kaam shuru hua tha, jinaki bhoomi ke khurd-burd hone kii shikaayat ai thi
 Many such trusts were also banned
 lekin yah zyada dinon tak chalaa nahin
 Gunjyal says, "these kinds of works are a bit long and complicated
 dharm ke naam par jameen kii lut ko rokane ke liye police ko or prabhavi dhang se kaam karne kii jarurat he
 "on the strength of miscreants, the game of cladding is also played by the Mahants in various akharas and monasteries
 ek baar chaddar chadha di gai or mahant ko mathadhish kii gaddi mil gai to phir isi chaddar ke bal par ve kuch hi dinon ke bheetar kaaphi paise kama lete hai
 There is no need to delve into the old history of the alleged Mahants before offering them
 gaddi hathiyaane ke chakkar main chaddar chadhvane ke liye shishy apane guru kii hatya karne se bhi nahin chookte
 In the last five years, 29 Mahants have been killed here
 kuch varsh purv haridwar ke kankhal ashram se ramdev ke guru shankardev ke gum ho jane kaa samachar surkhiyon main rahaa tha
 Despite the CBI investigation of the case, this missing person could not be traced till date
 haridwar main is tarah ke kai maamle dekhne ko mili hai
 This city of religion and pilgrimage is constantly becoming a base for forgery and fraud in cases of murder, crime and property
 ek ke baad ek 29 hatyaein ho jane ke baavjood police dwaara chaar hatyaon kaa khulaasa kiya janaa hi apane aap main kai sawaal khadey karata he
 Priyadarshan, director of the upcoming action thriller film Tej, believes that there was no need for Mallika's item number 'laila' in this film and it was taken only for promotion in the film
 priyadarshan kehete hai, ‘main kabhi nahin chahta tha ki is film main item number ho lekin hamaare nirmaataa ratan jain ise film main rakhana chaahate the isliye ise liya gaya
 According to Priyadarshan, he is not against the item numbers in films but does not like such songs unnecessarily inserted in the film
