 Tea plantation workers in Alidwarpur, West Bengal, started getting their wages stuck for three weeks

 'while most workers are happy with the new developments, some have said that payment is difficult in 15 days
 inkaa kahana he ki hafte main bhugtan milane par har din kaa jaruri saamaan khareednaa aasaan hota he
 Tea plantation worker Laxmi Mahali said, 'we used to get paid every week before demonetisation came into force
 hamaare parivaar main sabhi chaay bagan main kaam karte hai
 Therefore, it is the only source of income
 15 din kii jagah 7 din main bhugtan milanaa hamaare liye zyada suvidhajanak tha

 a new debate has emerged in the last round of hearing on the Ram temple in the Supreme Court
 yah bahes he ram ke vanshaj ko lekar
 The question is that even today, if there are descendants of Rama and if they are there then who are they and where are they? Whereas claims are being made from all over the country, some are claiming from the royal family of Rajasthan and some other castes are claiming
 haalanki, ayodhya main din-raat bhagwaan ram kii seva karne vaale yaa ramakatha kehane waalon ke mutabik ram ke vanshaj to hai lekin sirf daawey se nahin hoga, use pramanit bhi karnaa hoga
 Satendra Das, the chief priest of Ramjanmabhoomi said, 'see Lord Rama ruled for 11 thousand years and after that he went to his supreme abode
 param dham jane ke pehle unhone apane bete lav or kush ko apana samrajya saunpa tha
 All of Rama's brothers had two sons
 sabake do-do bete the to unke vansh bhi hai, lekin pramanit yah karnaa padegaa ki koun unke vanshaj hai
 'authentically in the Sikh dynasty tradition we get a statement from Guru Nanak Dev Ji in which he has said that he is a descendant of Lord Rama, that is, a dynasty, but this lineage has come out of those Gurus who attained divinity
 
 das kehete hai ki bhagwaan ram ke vansh ko poojana sanathan dharm ko khojane jaisaa he, kyonki bhaaiyon ne alag-alag nagar basaae, alag-alag samrajya basaae, to unke vansh bhi honge lekin in vanshon ko dhundhna padegaa, research karnaa padegaa
 If you are the real descendant of Rama, then he will be Suryavanshi
 ramakatha vaachak ramanand das ne kaha, 'hamaare yahaan vaidic parampara main shriram vansh parampara akshunya rahi he or vansh kaa naash nahin hota isliye suryvansh he
 All the brothers of Lord Rama settled the cities with their names
 sambhav he ki us parampara main kuch log hon jinke paas ise pramanit karne kaa aadhaar ho
 He said, 'in our stories, we resort to the Bhagavata and the Puranas, then there is the dynasty of Kush, the dynasty of Pundarik, the Suryavanshi people who call themselves descendants of Lord Rama
 lakshmana ne vidisha nagari madhya pradesh main basaai
 People there call themselves descendants of Lord Rama
 'unhone kaha, 'nishchit taur par bhagwaan ram kii vansh parampara he lekin ham log unhen ishwar ke rup main maanate hai jo log apane aap ko suryavanshi yaa shri ram kaa vansh kehete hai, sambhav he unke paas koi aadhaar hoga, lekin kisi aadhaar par hamaari jaankaree main aisa koi nahin he jo bhagwaan ram kaa vanshaj ho
 In addition to the temple in Ayodhya, the city of Lord Rama, there is a Tulsi research institute where research on the history and archeology of Rama goes on
 yahaan kai aisi kitaaben mili hai or likhi gai hai jisamen bhagwaan ram kii aitihaasikta or puratatviktaa, donon khoji gai hai
 It is mentioned in many books that his lineage has gone after Lord Rama
 tulsi shodh santhaan ke prashasnic adhikari ramatirath ke mutabik is santhaan ke paas 63 se 65 vanshon kii parampara or vanshavali bhagwaan ram kii he lekin bhagwaan ram ke putr lav or kush ke baad koi vanshavali nahin milti

 Despite the changing trend of shopping in India, Sambhavi Sinha came up with an idea in view of people's attachment to traditional shops
 jisane unki kismat badal daali
 This 25-year-old Sambhavi Sinha, living in Noida, is today known as a successful businesswoman
 unhone disambar, 2015 main Shopmate naam kii online shopping company shuru kii
 With the help of one leg, this man's body building became a champion
 
 
 jab lautin bharatsambhwi ne University of Virginia se mathematics or commers main grajuation kiya he
 According to the media report, when she returned to India in 2013, she noticed that traditional shops are running in India in this era of online
 bas yaheen se unke dimag main idia ne janm liya, or unhone sochaa kyon naa ek aisa online platform banaaya jaae jis par saamaan kii booking to online ho lekin uski kharid upabhokta apni najdiki dukaan se hi kar saken
 This means that in the online shopping world too, they chose a different way of working
 taaki graahakon ko kisi bhi prakaar kii pareshaani naa ho
 Meet the other Manjhi, who had built such roads without the help of the government, the biggest challenge was that Sambhavi started working, but the biggest challenge was to connect the shopkeepers
 unhen samajhaana kathin tha ki unhen kaise phayda hoga
 According to Sambhavi Sinha, his team explained that online visits have reduced the number of people visiting your shop
 aise main company online order lekar aapke paas graahak bhejegi
 The company will take a commission from the shopkeeper for this work
 sambhwi ne kaha ki kuch logon ko ye baat samaj ai or kuch ko nahin
 But after some time the hard work paid off
 media report ke anusaar thode samay main hi unke saath dilli-ensiaar ke 700 ke kareeb dukandaar jud gaye
 The big advantage for consumers in this model is that there is no possibility of fraud
 padhai chhod shuru kiya ye bijness, ab karata he karodon kaa turnoverin chizon kii karti he dlingsambhavi kii company electronics item, bike, scooter, mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop computer main dling karti he
 According to the media report, the company costing Rs 1 crore of Sambhavi has earned Rs 25 crore in the last year and a half
 ibien channel ko die ek intervyuu main sambhwi ne bataaya ki aaj ke daur main tarakkee ke liye acha idia jaruri he
 The idea should be to make life easier for people
 saath hi saxes paanaa he, to risk lenaa bhi sabase zyada jaruri he

 He was born on 14 January 1926 in Dhaka, the capital of present-day Bangladesh
 sahityakar mahasweta devi yun to bengal se aati thim or mul rup se bangla bhashaa kii lekhika thim, lekin iske baavjood vah har bhashaa, har samaaj main ek sammanit naam hai
 She was a noted social activist and writer of India
 mahasweta devi ne 1936 se 1938 tak shantiniketan main shiksha hasil kii thi
 He earned BA and MA degrees in English language
 rachanaakaar se pehle kahin zyada vah ek saamaajik kaaryakarta thim
 With his extremely sensitive and conceptual writing in Bangla language, he enriched the entire Indian literature
 vahiin lekhan ke saath-saath unhone puri jindagi stri adhikaron, daliton or adivaasiyon ke hiton ke liye vyavastha se sangharsh kiya
 Read - Vivekananda's Chicago speech, in which Mahashweta Devi, who spoke for Hinduism, married well-known playwright Bijon Bhattacharya
 bhattacharya 'indian pipuls theatre association' ke sansthaapak sadsy the
 The two separated in 1962 after the birth of son Navarun
 mahasweta devi ke kareebi logon kaa kahana he ki pati se alag hone ke baad mahasweta devi ko maansik pidaa or vittiya sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 
 
 
 loktantr main lok hi sarvopari hota halmuman aisa hota he ki lekhak yaa kalakaar khud ko raajnneetik pachade se dur hi rakhte hai
 He avoids political rhetoric despite having political understanding, but Mahasweta Devi was an exception in this matter
 jab pashchim bengal main vampanthi partiyon kii sarkaar thi or lambey samay tak satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baavjood unhen laga ki ve acha kaam nahin kar rahe to vah vipaksh ke manch par ja chadhin
 Putting his eyes in the eyes of the power, he tried to make it realize that in democracy, the people are paramount
 sarkarein to aani-jaani hai
 
 
 
 jab laal bahadur shastri ne dahej main liye the khaadi ke kapadeunaki kritiyambta den, ek lekhak kii sabase badi kasuti or safalataa yahi hoti he ki uski kritiyaan duniya kii alag-alag bhashaaon main anuvaadit hon
 The works of Mahasweta Devi 'mother of Thousand Eighty-four', 'agnigarbha' and 'claimant of the Jungle' are known and read as cult works
 unki rachana 'hajaar churaasi kii maa' par film bhi bani
 Mahasweta Devi has been awarded with the Raman Magsaysay Award for her works and Padma Vibhushan, the country's second highest civilian honor
 ve na sirf behtareen lekhika thim, balki unhone adivaasiyon adhikaron ke liye bhi kaam kiya
 His work on tribal society in various parts of the country is very remarkable
 sahitya main unke yogadan ko dekhte hue sahitya academy or gyanpith puraskaar bhi diya ja chukaa he
 He was also awarded Raman Magsaysay and Padma Vibhushan due to political and social activism
 
 
 
 When said goodbye, Mahasweta Devi died in Kolkata on 28 July 2016
 wo do maheene se aspataal main bhartee thim
 After which he took off from this world
 dilli ke thagon ko lekar kisse or kahaniyon kii koi kami nahin he
 Here, the victim of the game is not known before the eyes
 dilli ke karol baag ilaake ke ek showrooms se chori kii hairaan karne vaali vaardaat saamne ai he
 The sight of a Sharif husband-wife couple deteriorating on the goods of the unclaimed other and on seeing both, they became thieves
 donon ek showrooms main shopping karne aae the lekin jab unhone shopping karne ai ek ladki ke token ko laavaaris padaa dekha, to usee token kii badaulat hajaaron kaa maal le ude
 Nikita, a resident of Delhi, arrived for shopping in Kakrol Bagh with her friend on 24 February
 bahut sari khariddaari ke baad ye donon saheliyaan ek juuton ke showrooms main pahunchi
 Where Nikita had to buy sandals
 lekin showrooms main daakhil hone se pehle donon ne niyam ke mutabik apane saath liye hue saare shopping bag dukaan ke security guard ke hawaale kiye or usase saamaanon ke badale main ek token le liya
 So that later those tokens can be returned and take back their goods
 nikita ne apni saheli ke saath baithkar sandals tri kiye
 During this time, he also got a token found in his hand instead of a bag
 sandals tri karne ke dauraan galati se usne apni seat par wo token rakh diya or token uthaae bagaiyr kuch or sandals tri karne ke iraade se uthakar dukaan ke duusare hisse main chali gai
 During this time, a couple sitting near Nikita were also buying shoes

 pichley match main sirf 46 gendon par naabad 62 ran banane vaale captain viraat kohli phir chahenge ki unke teen star ballebaaz hi ranon kii zimmedaari puri kar den
 Chris Gayle (4 matches - 147 runs), captain Virat Kohli (5 matches - 185 runs) and the dashing AB de Villiers (5 matches - 176 runs) are not a challenge if they survive

 For the Shiv Sena, which emerged as the largest party in the KDMC, it was nothing short of a headache

 Kumar Vishwas appealed to the public to stop relying on the dynasties, as it is too much
 kumaar vishwaas ne apni kavita main kuch pherbadal karte hue kaha, 'amethi kii bechaini ko bas pagal samajhataa he, main amethi se dur kaisaa hum, ye meraa dil samajhataa he
 Before Kumar, Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh said that in Amethi his party would win by at least one lakh votes
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki un par hamale kiye ja rahe hai, lekin in hamalon se ve pareshaan hone vaale yaa hatane vaale nahin hai

 story viral hone par ise fasebuk ketrending topics pramukhataa se dikhaai gai
 Significantly, this trending topic made on Facebook's main page 1 every month

 The shocking thing is that neither that news anchor supported Hillary Clinton nor she was removed from the news channel
 yani fasebuk trending topics main trend karne vaali story juthi sabit hui
 Fox News called the incident a mistake and talked to Facebook on the issue and called it an abuse
 isse pehle jab fasebuk par purvaagrah trendig topic kaa aarope laga tha to company ne ise lagbhag puri tarah se computer aadhaarit kar diya tha
 26 employees were removed from this department, including 19 news curators and 7 copy editors

 It is being told that the people of the Facebook Trending Topic Department gave this story a place because more was being written about it
 sawaal yah he ki kya mashin ke jariye khabaron kii gunvattta kii jaanch kii kii ja sakati he
 Because the company claims that the company has left the trending topics in the machine to eliminate bias

 There is an appeal to Jitendra Singh and the public representatives of the society to talk first on this issue
 bansla ne kaha ki jaipur bheje jane vaala pratinidhimandal gathit kar diya he, lekin yah samaaj ke netaaon se baatcheet hone ke baad hi jaipur jaayegaa
 Spokesperson of Rajasthan Gurjar Reservation Sangharsh Samiti, Dr

 The conflict between the Kejriwal government and the Lieutenant Governor is increasing
 shuukravaar ko LG ne dilli main minimum veg badhaane kii file waapas lautaa di
 After this, Minister Gopal Rai called an emergency meeting at 2 o'clock in the Secretariat with the officials of Labor Department
 nunatam mazdooree badhaane vaali file lautate hi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nishane par lene kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya
 Kejriwal wrote in a tweet that on this day, when 18 crore employees are on strike, Prime Minister Modi's Lt

 comsata ke dashak kii ek blike and white film he anuraadhaa
 The film features a doctor husband dedicated to social service who has no time for his wife and home
 ghar main akele baithkar saamaan se baat karti ek stri he
 She used to be a singer at some point, but after hitting the mountains of house and house, knowing where the lyrics were, she went missing
 ab sirf puraani yaaden hai or behisaab akelaapan
 Once, she also decides to leave her husband
 film us stri ke dukhon kaa taana-bana jarur bunati he, lekin aakhirkaar khatm hoti he pati kii mahanata par
 The wife does not leave him
 uske baad aansuon or akelepan kaa kya hua, pataa nahin chalata
 The mention of this film exists here because the theme of Odia writer Pratibha Rai's new novel Sagar Swara is also similar
 vaigyanik pati timir, din-raat apane kaam main duba hua he
 He does not even realize that there is another person in the house and that human is not the machine of his laboratory
 uskaa dil he, vah mahasoos karata he, rota he, khush hota he
 Tears also come from his eyes and he feels the same prick of pain
 or yah insaan he uski apni patni trishna
 Sensitive, full of love dreams and desires, who wants to love, wants to be loved, but with whom? For the husband whom love wants, it is one of the items kept in the house like a chair, table, sofa and TV
 koi sochataa he ki kya kursi ko bhi dard hota hoga yaa mej ko bhi pyaar kii jarurat he?timir ke saath trishna har din ghul-ghulkar mar rahi he
 Only then does another mountain of sorrows break when she becomes the mother of a silent-deaf son, Saphalya
 jo bol na sake, uske dimag ko padhgaye ke liye vaigyanik pati ek aise yantra kaa avishkaar karata he, jiske jariye insaan ke bheetar ke un bhaavon ko padhaa ja sake, jo vah kah nahin paata
 And it is from here that the inner corners of the mind, the ruthlessness, cruelty and selfishness stored in it explores
 darasal yah kahani dimag ke ankahe konon kii padtaal bhi utani nahin he
 As Pratibha Rai writes, "man has reached the surface of the ocean, but has not yet reached the deep bottom of the human mind
" ” yah kahani stri ke dukh se bhare hone or uski aahat bhaawanaaon kii kahani zyada he
 The continuous melody of his solitude, whose notes are scattered throughout the novel
 or yahi satat raag sabase gambhir sawaal khadey karata he
 As much as we know the history of this world, as much as we know humans, we know the gender-based and unjust relationship between men and women, and especially the masculine mindset, even nothing seems strange
 ek doctor kii maut film kaa doctor bhi aisa hi tha
 Perhaps Einstein would have been like this too
 tolstoy bhi aise hi the
 So what? So that the woman has been shedding tears over the cruelty of men for centuries
 upanyaas, kahaniyon se lekar cinema tak is ‘minaa kumari syndrome’ se bhare pade hai
 But the question is, what next? Can a film like Anuradha in the twenty-first century or a heroine with a constant tear be the norm? Which path is she showing? There is a dialogue of Trishna in the novel, "worshiping the personality of the husband will live like a ascetic
 unke pati insaan nahin, devtaa hai
 "and" every moment they would feel that Timir does not want them
 phir bhi ve patni banakar jivit rahengi
 In the sixties, Anuradha could not leave her husband, but in the twenty-first century, Trishna could not leave Timir
 asli sawaal yahi he
 The time has passed fifty years, but the tears of the woman are flowing like that
 vah sochati tak nahin ki ab aansu ponchkar kuch duusare jaruri kaam kiye jaaen
 These tears should be investigated
 agar sirf ronaa-bisurna hi jindagi kaa makasad ho to yah upanyaas rulaata jarur he, lekin ronaa chhodkar, kahana nahin sikhaata
 In Amritsar, many people watching the burning of Ravana combusted the train, but the central and state government representatives are busy blaming each other
 punjab ke amritsar main badi rail durghatana hui he
 60 people have been confirmed dead after being hit by DMU (train number 74943) from Jalandhar going to Amritsar
 is par rail rajyamantri manoj sinha ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin he ki railway se yah apil kii gai thi ki ravan dahan ke dauraan train dhimi raftaar se chalaai jaae
 On the other hand, Navjot Kaur Sidhu, wife of Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister in the Punjab government, has said that every year it is appealed to the railways to run at a slow pace during the program, but there was no hearing on this in the railways
 vahiin, punjab sarkaar main mantri navjot singh siddhu ne is haadase ke liye railway ko puri tarah jimmedaar tehraaya
 Sidhu said that the speed of the train should have been slow, along with this it should have been warned by blowing the whistle, but in this case, due to complete negligence, many people lost their lives
 yah haadasa amritsar ke joda phatak ke paas hua he
 Heartwarming pictures are coming from the spot, which cannot be seen
 trek ke aasapaas khun le lathpath laashen bikhri padi hai
 Eyewitnesses at the scene are stating that the speed of the train was very high, while it should be reduced in view of the congested area
 is ghatana ko lekar sthaneey logon main kaaphi naaraazgi he
 Many people have gathered near the scene and are searching for relatives
 maukey par chaaron taraf logon ke rone-bilakhane kii tasviren dekhi ja sakati hai
 a large-scale police force has also been deployed
 ghayalon ko aspataal pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The suspense that has been created about Narendra Modi may lift the curtain on Sunday
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki modi hi 2014 chunaavon main bijepi kii kaman apane haathon main legein or ravivaar ko party ke adhyaksh rajnath singh isaki ghoshnaa bhi kar denge
 The party has started to appear divided into two groups regarding Modi
 ek ore jahaan modi kaa raag alapa ja rahaa he to duusari ore diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani is faisle se khush najar nahin aa rahe
 The debate over Advani's displeasure became heated when he was seen missing from the meeting before the party's national executive meeting began in Panaji
 haalanki iske liye bahaanaa diya gaya ki adwani biimaar hai
 At the same time, Jaswant Singh, Uma Bharti and Shatrughan Sinha also appeared ill in the name of Modi and did not reach the meeting
 sushamaa swaraj baithak main to pahunchi lekin kaaphi deree se
 Sushma Swaraj had reached Panaji at half past one in the afternoon but reached the meeting quite late
 unke der se pahunchane ke kaaran baithak bhi kareeb dedh ghante kii deree se shuru hui
 According to sources, before the meeting, Sushma Swaraj wanted that the issue of Modi and Advani be resolved

 JDU has lent its support to the decision
 party pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki is faisle se us yuva tabake ko virodh jataane kaa mauka milegaa jo ab tak fasebuk or tivetor par hi raajnneeti ke girte str ke khilaaf jang chede hue the
 How long will it take to be implemented! Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap has said that it will be seen how soon the Election Commission is able to implement this decision
 abhi hamen maaloom nahin he ki voting mashiinon main 'koi nahin' kaa vikalp joda janaa takneekee rup se kitna jaldi sambhav he
 He also said that it will not have a significant impact on political parties and there is no need to impose them
 kehete hai ki hunar kisi kaa mohataaj nahin hota or yah baat sach sabit kar di he elahabaad ke malak raaj ilaake ke nivasee vimal kishor ne
 With one leg, Divyang Vimal has created a unique two-seater car
 vimal choti si coffee kii dukaan chalaate hai
 He designed it on a scooty and made it look like a small car
 isamen do logon ke baithne kii suvidha he
 Vimal said that this car has been built keeping in mind the disabled and the elderly, which is named 'lailo'
 is choti si car ko banane main 90 hajaar rupee kharch hue or yah car teen maheene main ban kar taiyaar hui
 The specialty of this car with a seating capacity of two is that it is built on the scooty, which also has a music system and a hooter, which is powered by a battery and its battery is charged with a solar system
 yah car self start he
 The comments is choti si car ko banane kaa makasad poochne par vimal kishor bataate hai ki vah divyang hai or car chalaane main dikkat hoti he
 In view of the problem of accelerator brake etc
 in driving the car, he got the idea that why not make a car that can be easily run by the disabled and elderly and that car can be parked anywhere easily
 vimal kishor jab apni is choti si car ko lekar sadakon par nikalate hai, to dekhne waalon kii bheed lag jaati he
 Everyone just keeps looking at it and is desperate to take a picture of this small car
 itnaa hi nahin, jab logon ko jaankaree hoti he ki is choti si car ko vimal kishor ne banaaya he to isaki saraahna bhi karte hai or vimal kishor ke is jazbe ko salaam bhi karte hai
 It cost 90 thousand rupees to build this small car and this car was completed in three months
 do logon kii baithne kii suvidha vaali is car kii khaasiyat yah he ki yah skuti par bani hui he, jisamen mujeec system or hooter bhi laga he, jo bydaree se sanchalit hota he or isaki bydaree solar system se charge hoti he
 This car is self start
 tippaniyan On asking the motive for making this small car, Vimal Kishore says that he is a disabled person and has difficulty in driving the car
 car chalaane main excilator brake aadi main dikkat hone ke maddenjar, unhen yah vichaar aayaa ki kyon na aisi car banaai jaae jise divyang or bujurg aasaani se chalaa saken or vah car kahin bhi aasaani se park ho sake
 When Vimal Kishore takes out this small car on the streets, there is a crowd of spectators
 har koi bas ise dekhtaa hi rahata he or is choti si car kii tasviir lene ko betaab rahata he
 Not only this, when people are aware that this small car has been built by Vimal Kishore, then they also appreciate it and salute the spirit of Vimal Kishore

 cricketer se netaa bane imran khan ko pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) party ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye namankit kar liya he
 However, it is not yet decided when he will take oath as Prime Minister
 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf ne desh ke nae pradhanmantri ke rup menimran khanko chaynit kar liya he
 The decision was taken at a meeting of the party's parliamentary committee in a private hotel in Islamabad
 party kii ore pradhanmantri pad ke liye namit kiye jane paraimran khaanne un par vishwaas jataane ke liye party kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Cricketer-turned-politician 65-year-old Imran Khan's party emerged as the single largest party in the July 25 general election
 gat saptaah chunaavon main party kii jeet ke baad imran khan pehali baar bani gaala sthit apane awaas se nikle
 Despite refusing to drive with a large convoy of vehicles, they were accompanied by a large number of cars and were provided with heavy security
 khabaron main kaha gaya he kipakistanke nae pradhanmantri ke shapath grahan samaaroh kii taarikh kii ghoshnaa abhi nahin kii gai he, lekin yah 14 agast ko desh ke swatantraaa diwas ke din ho saktaa he

 pitiai pravaktaa fawaad choudhary ne ummid jataai ki balochistan neshnal party (mangal) pitiai kaa samarthan kar sakati he, aisa hone par neshnal assembly main party ke samarthakon kii sankhya 177 tak pahunch jaaegi
 The Center has decided to send security forces to end the ongoing blockade in Manipur
 naga samoohon ne pichley 65 dinon se do rashtriya rajmargon par nakaabandi kii hui he, jiske chalate manipur main jaruri saamaan kii kami ho gai he
 Home Secretary GK Pillai said, 'we have decided to send a central force to end the blockade
 ’ vibhinn naga samoohon ne 11 april se nagaland se guzarate hue manipur kii ore jane vaale rashtriya rajmarg 39 (imphal-dimapur) or rashtriya rajmarg 53 (imphal-silchar) kii nakebandi kii hui he
 The Manipur government did not allow NSCN leader t Muivah to visit his ancestral home, due to which Naga groups took this step as a protest
 pillai ne bataaya ki donon pradeshon ke mukhya sachiv sthiti kii samiksha karne ke liye buudhvaar ko mulaakaat karenge
 This economic blockade has worsened the situation in Manipur as all the goods in need have been reduced in the state
 ol naga students association ne pradesh main chah swaitshasi jila parishadon main chunaav karaane ke faisle ke virodh main nakebandi kii shuruuaat kii thi
 The organization alleges that the councils have not been given full rights for development work
 manipur sarkaar ne teen may ko enessien (iem) mahasachiv muiva ko pradesh main ghusane kii anumati nahin di, jiske baad nakebandi ko or gahan kar diya gaya
 Prior to the blockade, about 300 to 400 trucks used to transport essential goods on both the national highways
 loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle uttar pradesh main congress kii naiya paar lagane ke liye priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko ek saath mahasachiv banaaya gaya tha
 At the same time, Priyanka was assigned the responsibility of East UP and Scindia for West UP, but both leaders failed completely
 rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh pad chhodane ke baad loksabhaa chunaav main haar kii jimmedaari lete hue sindhiya ne mahasachiv pad se istipha de diya he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether Priyanka Gandhi will also resign from her post, as she also has responsibility like Scindia? Let us tell you that Priyanka Gandhi has responsibility for 42 seats from Kanpur to Gorakhpur division in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats
 Was handed over jabaki, jyotiraditya sindhiya ke kandhon par pashchim upi kii 38 loksabhaa siton kaa prabhaar tha
 The Congress which contested the election under the chairmanship of Rahul Gandhi was expecting better results from Priyanka and Scindia, but the party had to face a tremendous defeat in the state
 mahaj sonia gandhi apni seat raibareli hi bachaa sakin
 Of the 38 parliamentary seats held by Scindia, only Imran Masood was able to save his bail
 vahiin, priyanka gandhi ke prabhaar vaale ilaake main rahul gandhi amethi or shriprakash jaiswal kanpur se aise ummidavaar rahe, jinaki jamaanat bachi thi
 Rahul Gandhi suffered a crushing defeat in Amethi, considered a fortress of the Congress
 amethi main gandhi parivaar ke kisi sadsy ko apatkaal ke baad pehali baar is loksabhaa chunaav main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 In 1977, Sanjay Gandhi was defeated by Ravindra Pratap Singh of the Bharatiya Lok Dal and now Rahul Gandhi has been defeated by bjp's Smriti Irani
 is haar ne rahul hi nahin balki congress ko bhi hilaakar rakh diya he
 The responsibility of the Amethi parliamentary seat was on the shoulders of Priyanka Gandhi
 priyanka gandhi amethi main chunaav prachaar hi nahin balki sanghathan main niyukt se lekar vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaaron ke chayan kaa kaam bhi kiya
 She was watching the work not only in this election but also since 2004
 iske baavjood amethi kaa kila nahin bachaa sakin
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress was in such bad condition during the Emergency, when the party's account in the state was not even opened in 1977
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi nattejey apatkaal se kam nahin the
 That is why Jyotiraditya Scindia, on the lines of Rahul Gandhi, has resigned from the post of general secretary taking responsibility for the defeat
 sindhiya ke istipha dene ke baad priyanka gandhi par bhi dabaav bad gaya he, kyonki donon netaa ek saath mahasachiv banaae gaye the
 The two leaders used to sit in the same room of the Congress and together started the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya priyanka gandhi bhi purvi upi main haar kii jimmedaari lengi or mahasachiv pad or purvi uttar pradesh ke prabharee pad se istipha dengi
 Since the Delhi gang rape, the whole of India has been making the same demand in unison
 rape kaa kanoon badalo or repist ko faansee do
 But the question is, will the rape be stopped only by changing the law or making the law tougher? Looking at the picture of crime in India, even if this demand is accepted and if the death sentence is fixed for rape, then the appearance of this crime will not change
 hindustan main jurm ko jurm bataane ke liye bhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) taiyaar kii gai
 The IPC currently has a total of 511 streams
 yani ipisi ke lihaaj se hindustan main kul 511 tarah ke jurm hai
 There is a provision of capital punishment under seven sections of the IPC — 121, 132, 302, 305, 307, 364 and 396
 ipisi kii sabase majboot dhara 302 yani murder kaa aainaa dikhaate hai
 From the year 2002 to 2011, 3,31,907 people have been murdered in India
 yani har din 94 katl hote hai, har ek ghante main chaar or har 15 minute main ek hatya
 In the case of murder, Hindustan is at number one for the last ten consecutive years
 duusare number par america or tisare number par dakshin africa he
 In India, on an average, only seven per cent of people get punished despite having more than thirty thousand murders every year
 neshnal krime ricard beuro or kuch duusare aankadon ke mutabik, pichley 63 barason main hindustan main lagbhag 15 lakh logon kaa murder ho chukaa he
 But not even 50 people were hanged for murder
 ab jaraa balaatkaar ke aankadon par najar daalen
 The maximum punishment for rape under IPC section 376 is life imprisonment
 sarkari aankadon ke hisaab se pichley das saal main hindustan main 1,98,139 balaatkaar ke maamle saamne aae
 That means 66 every three hours and every 20 minutes a rape occurs in the country
 murder ke maamle main jahaan canvikshan rate yani sajaa dilaane kaa ausat saat fisadi he vahiin rape ke maamle main yah ghatakar 6
 3 percent
 yani pichley das salan main balaatkaar ke jo do lakh maamle saamne aae unamem se faqat 12,000 logon ko hi sajaa mili
 Now just think, is it enough to justify hanging the rape? If yes, then why in the world is India number one in the case of murder for which the death sentence is already fixed? There is no doubt here, direct questions arise because the precedent of murder is before us
 jisamen pehle se hi faansee kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 Still people are not afraid to commit murder
 balki katl ke sabase zyada maamle hindustan main hi hai
 Obviously, if there was a fear of death, then the cases of murder would have been less
 par aisa nahin he
 Therefore, to think that just by making stringent laws will reduce rape cases is wrong
 to ab sawaal yah he ki kya phir balaatkaar or murder ke aankade kabhi kam nahin honge? bilkul kam ho sakate hai
 All that is required is that whatever law we have is strictly and expeditiously followed
 bas agar itnaa ho jaae ki desh main balaatkaar or murder ke maamalon kii sunwaayee saal bhar ke andar puri kar mujarimon ko unke kiye kii sajaa mil jaae
 Then see how the picture of crime in India changes
 tivi par ek se badhkar ek lagjri condom ke vigyaapan dekhne ke baad bhi ho saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main aap use kharid hi na saken
 Actually, a big crisis is going on in the luxury condom market in India
 aisa condom ke adhiktam daam tay kiye jane se hua he
 According to the new drug pricing order, a condom costs 6
 50 rupee se zyada nahin ho sakati he
 The problem is that no luxury condom can come in this price
 haalanki condom banane vaali kai companiyon ne nae condom prising order ko adaalat main chunauti di he
 According to an English newspaper report, TTK has filed a petition in the Madras High Court against the government order fixing the maximum price for condoms as drugs
 duusari companiyaan bhi sambandhit vibhaag par daam ko phir se vichaar karne kaa dabaav bana rahi hai
 Condom makers have also reduced advertisements after orders came in last month
 bharat main nae premium condom utaarne kaa plan bhi taal diya gaya he
 Why the need to control price? Condoms were considered as a necessary tool to overcome the rapidly increasing birth rate in India
 itnaa hi nahin, yon rogon par rokthaam ke liye condom behad upyogi cheez sabit hoti he
 The government's intention behind fixing its maximum price is that the condom could not be more expensive and it should be easy for everyone to access
 condom nirmaataa companiyon kaa pakshacondom banane vaali companiyon kaa kahana he ki bharat main lagjri condom kii keemat anya deshon ke mukaable pehle se hi kam he
 In such a situation, the sale of luxury condom will be stopped due to fixing the maximum price
 bharat main abhi 1 pis lagjri condom kii keemat kareeb 10 se 20 rupee ke bich baithti he
 The most expensive condom Durex Realfeel costs around Rs 50 per piece
 jawan ke pair main chot ai he or vah kisi bhi tarah ke khatre ke baahar he
 He fell very hard on the ground, but the incident was so overwhelming that the people around him were also shocked
 haalanki maukey par maujuud medical team ne furti dikhaate hue jawan ko aspataal le gai or philhal doctoron ne bataaya he ki vah puri tarah khatre se baahar he

 Dr
 afridi ko 33 saal kii sajaa sunai gai he or jo katautee kii gai he uskaa matlab he ki paak ko har saal 10 lakh dollar kii madad se vanchit rahanaa hoga
 The proposal brought by Senator Lindsey Graham was unanimously approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday
 is kadam se america ke badalte ruukh, khaas kar pakistan ke prati america saansadon kii badhati naaraazgi kaa pataa chalata he
 Afridi has been reduced to $ 1 million per year based on the number of years he has been sentenced
 seenet kii viniyog samiti main is prastaav ke paksh main kul 30 mat pade
 Nobody voted against it
 is prastaav ke paarit hone ke baad seenet kii ek anya samiti ‘seenet armd services cameti’ ne gathbandhan samarthan nidhi (siesuef) ke ek arab 75 karod dollar kii raashi kii uplabdhta ko bhi simit kar diya he
 This ban will continue until the Defense Minister confirms that Afridi will not be sent to jail
 samiti ne ek bayaan main kaha ki vah afghanistan main kii ja rahi koshishon kaa samarthan karne vaale deshon ke kharch kii bharpai karne ke liye ek arab 75 karod dollar kii siesuef ko adhikrut karti he lekin pakistan ke maamle main isaki uplabdhta ko us vakt tak simit karti he jab tak raksha mantri is baat kii pushti nahin kar dete ki islamabad ne chuninda mandandon ko puraa kiya he

 ’america kaa kahana he ki dow shakeel afridi ko rajdroh ke jurm main sajaa sunaae jane kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has condemned Afridi's sentence as "unjust and unwanted"
 hillari ne kaha, ‘hamen unhen doshi tehraae jane par or unhen jo sajaa sunai gai he us par afsos he
 He said, 'we are raising this issue and will continue to raise because we feel that what has been done to him (with a Pakistani doctor) is unjust and unwanted
 ’seenet kaa nayaa faisla bataata he ki varsh 2013 ke liye pakistan kii 80 karod dollar kii sahaayta kaa chaar fisadi alag kar diya gaya he
 This includes $ 250 million in foreign aid and $ 50 million for Pakistan's efforts to combat terrorism
 kul 80 karod dollar kii yah raashi us do arab tees karod dollars se bahut kam he jiskaa obama prashasan ne pakistan ke liye anurodh kiya tha
 Earlier this week, another committee of the House of Representatives made a similar recommendation
 seenetter patric lehi or seenetter lindse graham ne pakistan ko shizophreniagrast sahyogi qaraar diya he jise islamic ugravadiyon ke haathon gaharaa nuksaan hua he jabaki isi dauraan vah hakkaani network or anya samoohon ko sharan bhi de rahaa he
 Lehi said that if this is the cooperation, he would not like it
 prabhaavshaalee seenetter diane fenstein ne kaha ki pakistan ko ab tak aatankwaadiyon ke haathon gambhir nuksaan hua he or usne ab tak rajdroh ko samajhe bina afridi ko doshi tehra diya
 He also said that Afridi is not a detective
 dow afridi par abtabad main siie kii madad ke liye farji tikaakaran kaarykram chalaane kaa aarope he
 Bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad and was killed in a US secret operation on May 2 last year
 dow afridi ke kaarykram kaa uddeshy abtabad ke parisar main chhipe bin laden ke parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy ke diene kaa namoona hasil karnaa tha

 parijanon ne hi police ko ghatana kii soochna di
 Police reached the spot, took down the body of the girl hanging from the fan and sent it for postmortem
 police ne bataaya ki chaatra ke kamare yaa laash ke paas se koi suicide note nahin mila he
 Family members told the police that their child was studying in MGM school in class 10th
 ghatana ke din vah skool ceder se lautithi
 On returning late, the father reprimanded him
 maa ne bhi naaraazgi jaahir karte hue usase baatcheet nahin kii
 Family members said that because of the ever-decreasing incidence of crime against schoolgirls and women, they too used to worry about their child
 isi ashanka ke chalate mata-pita use samay par ghar lautne kii hidaayat dete rahete the
 On the day of the incident, when the father asked his daughter the reason for the delay, she could not give any concrete reason
 is par pita ne use jamkar daant pilaai

 2) PDP also says that the package of 80 thousand crore rupees that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave to Jammu and Kashmir last year, more than 50 percent of it was given for development works, whereas for the Kashmir floods of September 2014 Only Rs 7854 crore has been given
 lekin tathy yah bhi hai ki modi sarkaar ne nepal baadh ke liye 6757 karod die hai
 3) Political experts believe that Mehbooba Mufti cannot become the stature of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed as a leader
 mahabuuba ko party ke srinagar sansadeey kshetra ke saansad tarik hamid kara nekhule taur par chetavaneede rakhi he
 He says that Mehbooba should not form an alliance with the BJP again
 4) mahabuuba mufti ko ek dar yah bhi he ki tarik hamid kara party main vidroh karvaa sakate hai
 Or he can weaken the party by resigning from the post of MP
 agar aisa hota he to pidipi ke liye srinagar sansadeey kshetra kii seat dobaaraa jeetna lagbhag naammumkin hoga
 5) There is also an argument that after the death of his father, Mehbooba is sad that there were fewer people on his father's funeral
 vah sambhavat: yah bhi soch rahi hon ki janaaje main kam janata kaa aana shaayad is baat ke sanket hai ki kashmiri avam pidipi se khafa he or isaki vajah bijepi se gathbandhan he
 6) Mehbooba feels that if she becomes the Chief Minister, her party cannot win the Parliamentary seat of Anantnag
 unhen yah bhi pataa he ki abhi tak bijepi ke saath sarkaar na banaakar bhi vah khatre ke saath khel rahi hai or agar zyada der hoti he to party ke vidhayak aage-peeche bhi ja sakate hai
 What to say Congress Congress spokesperson Ravindra Sharma says, "the alliance of BJP and PDP was wrong from the beginning, because both the parties had taken votes by fooling the people
" pidipi ne kashmir main logo ko kaha tha ki agar vah jammu-kashmir main aresas se bachanaa chahate hai to unki party ko vot daale
 Similarly, in Jammu, BJP asked people to vote for BJP if they want to keep PDP out of the government

 ) Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said in a conversation with Senior Editor Shweta Punj that India has been in constant bargaining with oil producing countries to enable proper pricing of crude oil
 saath hi eendhan ko jiesti ke daayre main laane ke liye rajya sarkaron ke saath bhi baatcheet jari he
 Excerpts from the talk: Is the government considering bringing fuel under GST? In principle, petroleum products should also be under GST
 rifinary, tel nikaali jaise petroleum udyog ke austream or menstream input par jiesti chukaana hota he lekin hamen input sabsidi nahin milti kyonki hamaara antim utpaada jiesti ke daayre main nahin he
 In a way, this industry is also feeling vulnerable due to this reason
 mulya or karon kii tarksangatta tathaa is kshetra kii rajasav sthirataa ke nazariye se dekhen to yah udyog ke liye hi phydemand sabit hoga, basharte utpaadan se lekar marcenting tak samoochaa vailu chen jiesti main aa jaae
 We are requesting GST Council
 pehle rajya sarkarein petroleum ko jiesti main laane se anakani kar rahi thim, unhen apane rajasav ke nuksaan kii chintaa sata rahi thi
 After seeing the benefits that are coming from the implementation of GST, our belief has increased that oil will soon come under the purview of GST
 yahi meri praathamikta he
 Deep dissatisfaction is being seen over rising oil prices
 ab sarkaar kii kya ranneeti hogi?tel kii keemten teen pramukh karkon ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit hoti hai
 The international prices of crude oil depend on the geopolitical system, fluctuations in exchange rates and taxation of various states and the Center
 keemton main ek spasht antar tabhi dikhegaa jab teenon kaarak ek duusare ke poorak bane
 For example, international oil prices keep rising and even if we keep changing taxes, there will be no benefit
 sarkaar aam janata kii jeb par badhate boj ko lekar bahut samvedansheel he or hamane pichley saal aktubar main utpaada shulk main katautee kii, kuch sarkaron ne to karon main bhi katautee kii
 Every state government has its own commitments for development
 hamen sabhi pahaluon ke bich ek uchit santulan kaayam karnaa hoga
 Are you working with the state governments to reduce tax and pressurize the international community? We are not only discussing with the state governments, but are also trying to create geopolitical pressure
 ham tel-utpaadak deshon ko lagaataar yah ehsaas kara rahe hai ki bharat bada bazaar he
 We are saying that we are the world's third largest consumer of energy
 darasal prati vyakti urja kii hamaari khapat bahut kam he
 It will definitely increase in the coming times, so it is important for the countries that buy oil
 yahi kaaran he ki tel utpaadak lambey samay tak is baat kii upeksha nahin kar sakate
 What are the stances of oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia? There are indications that Saudi Arabia and Russia are looking to re-review their decisions to reduce production
 is maheene vienna main hone vaali mulaakaat main ve is baat par nirnay karenge
 Saudi Arabian oil minister told me that they are also considering our concerns and will take some decisions
 kachche tel kii kis keemat par bhartiya arthvyavastha aam taur par atirikt dabaav main nahin rahati?kachche tel kii keemat agar 55-60 dollar prati bairal rahe to hamaari arthvyavastha sahaj rahati he
 We have made this clear on many international forums
 yah 70 dollar prati bairal kii keemat hamen takalif de rahi he
 It has to be fixed
 kya centre utpaada shulk kam karegaa?kachche tel kii keemten neeche aani shuru hui hai
 As of May 30, petrol declined by 71 paise and diesel by 51 paise
 yah vaisaa vishay nahin he ki aapane ek baar keemten ghataayin or aapaki javabdehi khatm ho gai
 We are worrying about the man's pocket
 lekin jab antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat kam thi tab bhi tel kii keemat kyon kam nahin hui thi?congress yah mudda uthaa rahi he

 We want to keep consumers in the most relaxed state
 pichley maheene tel kii keemton main ek paise kii kami majaak nahin to kya he!6 june ko petrol kii keemton main 11 paise prati litre kii kami ai
 Before that there was a decrease of 13 paise
 ek june ko petrol paanch paise sasta hua
 There should not have been a money cut
 ise kisi anya katautee ke saath joda ja saktaa tha
 i believe it was a mistake
 yah price maikenism par nirbhar karata he or yah pehali baar nahin tha jab petrol kii keemat main ek paise kii katautee kii gai ho
 Now when can we expect oil prices to come down? Last time we cut excise duty, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat also reduced oil prices
 yah rajya sarkaron kaa daayitv bhi he
 This is not a fight between BJP and Congress
 har rajya kii apni alag jaruratein or alag bhugtan kshamtaayen hoti hai
 In the federal structure, i can only request state governments
 kya aashaa kii jaae ki sarkaar utpaada shulk main katautee karegi?logon ko samgr, dirghakaalik or nirantar suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karana hamaara daayitv he
 The poor class and middle class are affected the most by oil prices

 rajasthan ke gangster anandapal kii maut ke baad bhi wo ek bavaal bana hua he
 After the death of Anandpal, accused of killing innocents, police and common people, the whole of Rajasthan has gone up
 anandapal kii maut rajasthan main jaateey asmita kaa sawaal ban gai he or anandapal kii maut vartmaan sarkaar ke liye afat ban gai he
 Eventually the police had to forcibly cremate Anandpal
 lekin hangaamaa abhi thama nahin he
 For twenty days, a man, whose name has been considered as the biggest accused in the books of Jeet Jee Law, has now suddenly become the greatest Messiah of the poor, that is, Robinhood
 ji haa, ek aisa robinhood, encounter main hui jisaki maut ke baad uske chaahane vaale ab uski laash kaa tab tak antim sanskaar nahin karnaa chaahate the, jab tak sarkaar encounter kii sibiai jaanch karne kaa vaada naa kare
 And just for this same demand, Rajasthan kept smoldering for the last 20 days and this gangster's body was lying in deep freezer
 police ke liye sirdard tha anandapal singhek shaks jo jite ji qareeb do saalon se puure paanch suubon kii police ke liye chhalaava bana rahaa
 After repeated dodging, the police could neither arrest him again nor was he able to touch his corpse after his death in the encounter
 haalat ye he ki kabhi kaanoon kaa mulzim rahaa ye shaks apni maut ke baad sirf apane gaanv hi nahin, balki soobe ke hazaron logon ke bich ek aisa robinhood ban chukaa he, jiske encounter kii tah tak jane kii maang ko lekar log uski laash kaa antim sanskaar tak karne dene ko raji nahin the
 The number of policemen who made the target, Anandpal Ji, had caused great trouble for the law, now there is a huge headache even after death
 apane jite ji anandapal ne kai pulisavaalon ko apni goli kaa nishaanaa banaaya or ab maut ke baad bhi uski vajah se pulisavaalon kii zindagi par aan padi he

 In which many cabinet ministers also attended
 lekin sarkaar ke saamne sabase bada sawaal vahi rajput samaaj kaa hi rahaa, jo ab anandapal ke haq main sarkaar ke khilaaf uth khadaa hua he
 Obviously, this is also the case of vote bank
 aise main ek gangster kii maut ke baad vipaksh bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf mukhar hone laga he
 The face-to-face situation between the Rajputs and the government is that the confrontation that started between the government and the Rajput society over Anandpal is no longer taking the name of stopping
 aise main rajasthan sarkaar ke saath centre kii peshaaniyon par bhi ab bal padane lage hai
 The question is how to calm the ruckus about Anandpal without accepting the demand of Rajput society
 jisase saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi naa toote
 This is a contemplation of contemplation
 garlfriend ne anandapal ko khyati dilaadab baat us ladki kii, jisane anandapal ko anandapal banaaya
 That girl is her girlfriend Anuradha
 jisane anandapal ko naa sirf ek gaanv ke chore se english bolanewaala tej tarraar noujvaan bana diya, balki jurm kii duniya kii baarikiyaan bhi sikhain
 That is why without Anuradha, the mention of Anandpal is not complete
 asal main anuraadhaa hi wo thi jisane anandapal ko jurm kii duniya main nai pahchaan di
 The typical Anandpal was joined by Anuradha
 ek aisi ladki jisane english skool se padhai kii or dilli se grajuation or bisie kiya
 It is obvious that he is from a good family, but his thoughts were different
 daulat or shoharat ne banayalady donwo daulat or shoharat kii is kadar divaani thi ki uskaa dimag inhen chizon ke ird gird ghumta tha
 With this intention, he started stock work
 lekin kaamyaab hone ke bajaae wo karz main dub gai
 And got caught in the liability of crores
 bakaayaa chukaana mushkil tha isliye usne dabangai kaa rasta chunakar choti moti vaardaaton ko anjaam dena shuru kar diya
 And then in a few days she became Lady Dawn of Rajasthan
 ab to khud dendar bhi usase ghabaraane lage
 Anuradha had changed Anandpal Koab Anuradha had wealth as well as fame
 isi bich wo anandapal ke qareeb ai or donon pehali hi nazar main ek duusare ke behad qareeb aa gaye
 Now Anuradha himself took command of Anandpal's gang
 jurm kii planning karne lagi
 With Anuradha, he changed the existence of Anand Pal
 anandapal ne muhabbat main hi body bana lee
 Started wearing suitboots and hats instead of plain veneers
 ye anuraadhaa kii sohabat kaa hi asar tha ki ab anandapal bhi farrotedaar angrezi bolne laga
 Anandpal was arrested and weakened in April 2015
 Anuradha was arrested
 usase pehle se wo anandapal singh ke dimag ke taur par jaani jaati thi
 Together, they had filled the entire Shekhawat area with awe, they kidnapped more than half a dozen kidnappers and recovered a large ransom
 khabaron ke mutabik police or prashasan main anandapal kii badi paith thi saath hi amiron se lootakar garibon main baantne kaa robinhood style bhi anandapal ko bachane main uski madad karata rahaa
 He formed an army in the name of village-village brigade
 saath hi police-prashasan ko khud ko pakadaney kaa khulaa chalange bhi dene laga
 Meanwhile, Anandapala was weakened by Anuradha's departure

 According to party sources, there is no consensus in the party to send Vishwas to Rajya Sabha
 alaakaman kii naaraazgi or avishvaas ke kaaran kumaar kaa rajyasabha janaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Why Sanjay Singh got Rajya Sabha ticket? According to the information, the formal announcement and decision to send Sanjay Singh to Rajya Sabha will be in the party's highest unit PAC to be held on the night of January 2 or January 3
 sutron kii maane to unke naam par na sirf kejariwal ne muhar lagaai he balki party ke tamaam netaa unke naam par sahamat hai
 In fact, Sanjay Singh, a resident of Sultanpur, who has been gathering dust in the streets for 16 years, stood with every step of Arvind Kejriwal from RTI and Swaraj movement to Anna movement
 aam aadmi party banane ke baad sanjay singh ne dilli ke 2013 vidhansabha chunaav ke darmyaan pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Sanjay Singh also strengthened the organization of the party, with street-street, street-corner promotion
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi sanjay singh ne uttar bharat main jamkar prachaar kiya or sanghathan kii jimemdari sanbhali
 In the 2015 assembly elections held in Delhi, Sanjay Singh was the head of the party campaign committee
 2017 ke farvari main hue punjab vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sanjay singh punjab ke prabharee rahe or pehali vidhansabha chunaav main hi aam aadmi party punjab main 22 siten jitkar mukhya vipakshi party ban gai
 However, the Punjab assembly election was a major setback for the Aam Aadmi Party, which was most likely to win the AAP in the state elections
 sanjay singh ko arvind kejariwal ne upi ki jimemdari saunpi jiske baad haal hi main hue upi ke nikaay chunaav main aam aadmi party ne lagbhag 50 siton par jeet darj kar pradesh main apana raajnneetik khaataa kholaa
 Meanwhile, during the Delhi and Punjab assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Sanjay Singh was also accused of ticket manipulation and money transactions, but the evidence related to any allegations did not come before the party
 party ke kai netaa maanate hai ki sanjay singh behad mehnatee hai or vivaadon se dur party ke har chote-bade kaam ke liye maujuud rahe hai
 According to the information, due to this hard work of Sanjay Singh, Kejriwal has given him a ticket to go to Parliament
 sanjay sinhako tikat milane kii vajah se yah tasviir bhi saaf he ki kejariwal baaki do chehron ko agar party ke bheetar se chunate hai to uske liye nunatam maapdand kya ho sakate hai

 june kii shuruyaat main garmi ne uttar bharat main record par record tode to vahiin monsoon kii shuruyaat kaaphi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the formation of a nine-stage cyclone in the Arabian Sea weakened the monsoon, but by sending moisture-laden winds to North India, this cyclone completely destroyed the heat and was replaced by clouds

 Weather experts say that this rain looks like a monsoon, but the monsoon has not reached North India yet

 In such a situation, the kind of weather being seen in North India can be considered as a sign of this
 yani uttar bharat main is baar itani garmi nahin padegi jo monsoon ke badalon pani se labalab kar de

 Bhopal resident Dr
 abraar multani ayurveda ke mashhoor chikitsak hai or swasthya sambandhi kitabans likh chuke hai
 He is the founder of Incredible Ayurveda *** bisisiai main sabase zyada tajurbe vaale shaks jagmohan daalamia ko is baar daanv chalane kii jarurat nahin padi
 His silence, understanding and experience of history worked
 isamen kismat kaa tadakaa lagaaya arun jetali kii ranneeti ne
 And in this way, the arrogant lawyer also stopped the entry of Pawar faction into the board, sidelined Srinivasan and cleared the way for himself
 sab kuch chalaa script ke mutabikbaar-baar aisa bataaya ja rahaa tha ki ipel final ke pehle 23 may ko kolkata ke ek five star hotel main hue dinar main zyaadaatar board member shrinivasana ke khilaaf the or unke istife kii maang kar rahe the
 After that there were reports of rebellion being woven under the guidance of Arun Jaitley and Rajiv Shukla
 or phir sharad pavaar ne power play kaa mauka tad batting shuru kar di
 He put forward the name of his warlord and past board president Shashank Manohar
 pavaar ko laga ki manohar kii saaf suthri chhavi unke kaam aegi or uske saath aayega haath se fisali sone ke andey vaali murgi par phir kabja karne kaa mauka
 But by then Jaitley had realized his politics and strategy
 unhone apana vyuh nae sire se rachaa
 Dalmiya, at the beginning of the Sympathy dose incident, Srinivasan convinced himself that he would not resign
 cab adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia ne unhen itihaas samajhaayaa
 When the first fixing of busting took place in the nineties, Raj Singh Dungarpur was the BCCI President
 vah pad par bane rahe
 Then when the CBI report was filed and the players' involvement was established, Muthiah was the chairman and he too was in control
 to shrinivasana istipha kyon den
 But then Dalmiya also said that the angle is different here because Srinivasan's son-in-law Meiyappan is also under investigation
 salaah ke saath-saath daalamia ne ek baat kaa or dhyaan rakhaa
 He did not hurry
 shuruaati daur main board ke sadsy daalamia ko aage kar shrinivasana ko hataanaa chaahate the
 But Dalmiya said that my health is not good
 saath hi unhone shrinivasana ko apane saport kaa bharosa dilaayaa or kaha ki date rahiye
 From here Dalmiya froze in the eyes of Srinivasan
 phir jab pavaar ne pattey phenton or phenkane shuru kiye, to ladaai kii sabase puraani kahawat shakl paane lagi
 If enemies are shared, then friendship is formed
 muthaiya or shrinivasana jaani dushman hai, to daalamia raaj ko pavaar ne khatm kiya tha
 In such a situation, when Muthiah and Pawar were again juggling Srinivasan, Dalmiya decided that Pawar should not be allowed to enter the board again

 Jaitley too was not in a hurry like Dalmiya and was realizing that it would be appropriate to remain behind the curtain at the moment, instead of the thorny crown of the board president
 unhone board ke asantusht sadasyon ke bayanon ke jariye shrinivasana par dabaav banawaye rakhaa
 At the same time it also ensured that he does not give up his arms completely
 or phir ravivaar ko hui meeting kii final script bhi unhone hi rachi
 It was decided on Friday that Srinivasan would not resign
 ek antarim adhyaksh banegaa, jo jaanch tak kaam dekhegaa

 In the meeting, Rajiv Shukla said that this arrangement will be approved in the next executive meeting
 phir jetali ne do naam rakhe
 See Dalmiya from within the board and Shashank Manohar, if you see the alternative of the outside
 shrinivasana daalamia ke naam par maan gaye
 The partnership with old Rashukh and Bindra was amazing that even the remaining members could not oppose Dalmiya
 is tarah shrinivasana ko board se dur kiya gaya
 It is to be noted that no matter how fast this investigation goes, it will not be completed before September and by then Srinivasan's term will have been completed
 pavaar ko board vaapasi ke liye intjaar karnaa hoga
 He has also started an entry into the Mumbai Cricket Association
 udhar daalamia antarim ke baad puri tarah se kabiz hone ke liye lalayit hai
 But it will decide on which role he fits in the next script about Arun Jaitley's cricket
 aarope he ki jab se rakesh maaria is cese se dur hue hai tab se is maamle kii jaanch kuch dhimi hui he or police ko abhi chargeshit file kerani he
 All the accused are currently in judicial custody

 On Friday, Pakistan's Finance Minister Isaac Dar warned India that it would give a proper response in the event of any attack

 India is unable to digest the pakistan-china Economic Corridor project
 'ham bhikhaari nahin hai'unhone kaha ki ham kisi bhi bhartiya akraman kaa makul jawaab denge
 China gave a red flag to Modi
 hamane apni ankhe band nahin kar rakhi hai
 We have no soft attitude towards India

 Modi has accepted Nawaz's invitation to visit Pakistan
 vah agle saal SAARC sammelan main bhaag lene pakistan jaaenge
 As elections are coming closer, the atmosphere is becoming unbearably hot
 muddon se cat rahe netaa taarkik dhang se or budhimaani se apni baat kehane yaa pratidwandviyon kii baaten kaatane kii bajaay ek duusare par tikaa-tippanee karte hue najar aa rahe hai
 Not only this, his supporters have also followed the same pattern
 vyaktigat baaten jansabhaon main uthaanaa, abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal or charitra hanan, ye sab kuch ho rahaa he
 Such a decline of language and behavior was never seen in the past
 baat aalochana yaa ninda tak rah jaati to behatar tha, lekin ab to pratidwandviyon ke bare main aisi-aisi baaten bataai jaati hai jo sunne vaale ko hi stabdh kar de
 Suppose the Congress has nothing to say and is running away from the issues, its leaders have come down to very mild things, BJP also seems no less
 uske netaa bhi kuch aise hi bayaan jari karte rahete hai, jabaki unke paas kehane ko or vaada karne ko kaaphi kuch he
 But they are also publicly engaged in denial of the character of opposition leaders
 unki sabhaaon main bhi pagadiyaan uchhaali ja rahi hai or shishtataa ko tilanjali di ja rahi he
 It is a shocking thing and an attempt to weaken the roots of Indian democracy
 is tarah kii aalochanaon or vyaktigat akraman se desh kahaan jayega? jis bhartiya loktantr kii sari duniya main prashansa hoti he vahaan is tarah ke uddand vyavhaar kii apeksha nahin kii ja sakati or vah bhi unase jo raaj-paat chalaate hai
 The words of dignity, courtesy, restraint, etc
 are not just for the dictionary
 saarvajanik jivan main inkaa bahut mahatv he
 By contaminating the atmosphere, spewing poison, throwing mud, we can do politics, we cannot run the country
 kisi ko chota dikhaakar aap bada to nahin ban sakate
 By doing all this, what message are the political parties giving to the coming generations and youth? How much is his own image improving? In this country, even good people do not want to enter politics
 ab aisa vishakt maahaul dekhne ke baad bhala ab koun aana chahega? What did LK Advani give from all the posts of the BJP? The Congress got a chance to attack the main opposition party sitting
 congress netaa or kendriya mantri harish ravat ne kaha ki adwani ne jo shuru kiya tha aaj unhen usee kaa jaayaka dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 At the same time, Rita Bahuguna Joshi says that bjp's infighting has come in front of everyone due to Advani's resignation
 laalkrishna adwani par kataaksh karte hue harish ravat ne kaha ki rakt beej se jo doosraa raktbeej paidaa hota he wo jaada taqatvar hota he
 Narendra Modi is the advanced version of the politics that Advani started in this country and today Advani is getting a taste of that
 unhone kaha, 'sabhi bijepi netaa yah samaj rahe hai ki agar ye pahalwaan (narendra modi) dilli aa gaya to hamaara kya hoga or bijepi main ladaai isi baat par he
 On the other hand, Rita Bahuguna Joshi has said that the infighting of BJP has come in front of everyone
 unke mutabik, 'bijepi main do-faad ho chuki he
 It is clear from Advani's resignation that nothing is right inside the party
 'jab unase poocha gaya ki rajnath singh adwani ko manaane kii koshish kar rahe hai to unhone kaha, 'laalkrishna adwani koi bachche nahin hai
 He is an 80-year old leader who has taken the party forward
 'reeta bahuguna joshi ne narendra modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha, 'yah jo kuch nae log party main ubharkar saamne aae hai vah bijepi ke jhagade kii mukhya vajah he
 On the other hand, Congress spokesperson Janardan Dwivedi has said that this is an internal matter of BJP
 padhein sambandhit khabaren:adwani ne diya istipha, endie main bhuuchaalasushamaa ko bharosa, adwani ko manaa lenge2005 main jinna par tippanee ke chalate adwani ko chhodana padaa tha bijepi adhyaksh kaa pad
 
 
 So this is the game plan of Modi and BJP commanded by Modi, Advani's resignation is a side effect: Congress peedit ladki ne puri nidarta se apana bayaan darj karaayaa

" vah abhi kaaphi yogadan de sakate hai
 "give credit for the victory to Bangladesh as well," Gavaskar said, "yes, the result against Bangladesh is unfortunate but give some credit to Bangladesh for this as well
" unhone behtareen cricket kaa najaara pesh kiya
 Bangladesh have a new bowler (mustafizur Rahman) and the Indian batsmen have no answer to his left-handed angle

 "captaincy can become a burden at the age of 36" Dhoni, who was going through a bad phase, collided with Bangladesh's new fast bowling sensation Mustafizur during the first ODI, due to which he lost 75 percent of his match fees

 uttar pradesh kii rampur loksabhaa seat se samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar ajam khan or bhartiya janata party kii pratyaashee jaya pradaa ke bich jubaani jang tej ho gai he
 Senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has given an objectionable statement without naming Jaya Prada
 unhone kaha ki jisko ham ungali pakadakar rampur laae, aapane 10 saal jinase pratinidhitiv karaayaa
 
 
 It took you 17 years to understand his reality, i recognized in 17 days that his underwear is khaki color
 jaya pradaa par aapattijanak bayaan dene ke baad ajam khan mushkil main ghir gaye hai
 The National Commission for Women will send a notice to the leader of the Samajwadi Party and seek their response
 ayog ajam khan ko notice somvaar ko bhejega
 Addressing an election rally in Rampur, Azam Khan said, "I question all the people present in the public meeting whether politics will fall so much that the 10-year-old who drank the blood of the Rampur people, who brought us to Rampur by holding a finger
 jiskaa hamane puraa khyaal rakhaa

 ajam khan ne mujhe hameshaa jaleel kiya, hameshaa meraa apmaan kiya tha
 Jaya Prada said that Azam Khan can sacrifice me
 ye insaan hosh main nahin he, ye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 This battle is not new, this war between Ajam Khan and Jaya Prada is not new
 saal 2018 main jab padmavat film ko lekar puure desh main shor machaa hua tha, to jaya pradaa ne ajam khan kii tulana padmavat ke kirdaar khilji se kii thi, jise film main bahut hi krur darshaya gaya tha
 Azam Khan also responded to this statement of Jaya Prada in his own style
 ajam khan ne jaya pradaa koun he poochhate hue yahaan tak kah diya tha ki vah naachne-gane waalon ke munh nahin laga karte
 Enmity was openly exposed in 2009 This enmity of both the leaders was openly exposed in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 bhari sabha main manch se jaya pradaa ke aansu bhi har taraf surkhiyaan bane the
 However, before that there was a time when Azam Khan campaigned fiercely for him
 amar singh ke kehane par ajam khan ne hi 2004 main jaya pradaa ko rampur se chunaav ladvaya
 Also ensured his victory
 lekin ye dosti zyada nahin chali
 Even in 2009, Azam Khan opposed Jaya Prada's candidature with Samajwadi Party but got a ticket
 chunaav main ajam khan ne unka purajor virodh kiya, baavjood iske jaya pradaa jeet gayi
 The distance of the two leaders increased from here
 yahaan tak ki ajam khan ne khud ko samaajawaadee party se bhi alag kar liya or 17 may 2009 ko party ke mahasachiv pad se istipha de diya
 He soon returned and on 4 December 2010 the party called him back, canceling his expulsion
 iske baad jaya pradaa ko sapa se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya or 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav unhone rashtriya lokdal se tikat par bijanour seat se ladaa, jisamen wo haar gayi
 Now Jaya Prada has joined BJP just before the election and she is contesting against Azam Khan from Rampur seat

 The people of Pakistan have given victory to Imran Khan, but due to the shortage of some seats, due to the lack of seats, his party has had to do a lot to form the government
 sabase mushkil yah he ki imran jo sarkaar banaaenge, vah do-chaar saansadon vaali kai choti partiyon ke saath bani khichdi sarkaar hogi
 The Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party has emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly but has not won a majority
 pakistan chunaav ayog (ECP) dwaara jari antim aankadon ke mutabik use kul 115 siten hi mili hai
 According to Pakistan's law, a party must have at least 137 seats to form a government
 pakistan main 25 july ko chunaav hue the
 According to this result, at first glance, it seems that Imran is 22 seats away from a simple majority
 lekin ganit inta saadhaaran nahin he, isamen ek pech he
 Some PTI leaders have emerged victorious in many seats and they can remain in only one seat
 jaise khud imran khan paanch seat par chunaav jite hai or unhen chaar siten chhodani hongi
 Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N) has got 64 seats and Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has got 43 seats
 donon dal milakar pitiai sarkaar ko sansad main kadi takkar denge
 According to Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Sarwar Khan, a leader of the PTI, also stood for two seats and he will have to leave one seat
 khaybar pakhtunava ke purv mukhyamantri parvej khataak neshnal essembly or prantiy essembly, donon kii siton par vijayi hue hai, or vah bhi neshnal essembly kii seat chodenge
 In this way, PTI has only 109 seats
 pitiai ne saaf kiya he ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye PML-N or PPP kii madad nahin legi, isliye ab imran ko kai chote-chote guton kaa sahaara lenaa hoga
 They need 137 seats to secure a simple majority
 media reports ke anusaar,pitiai ke netamuttahida kaumi movement-pakistan (MQM-P) or kai nirdaliyon ke sampark main hai
 The MQM-P has six seats
 neshnal essembly main 13 nirdaleey chunakar aae hai
 PTI leaders have also approached the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) of Sindh for support
 jidie ke paas do saansad hai
 However, the GDA has not yet indicated support
 ek anya dal piemail-kaayad (PML-Q) ke paas bhi chaar siten hai, lekin isamen bhi punjab kepurv siemchoudhary parvej ilaahi do siton se vijayi hue hai
 That is, even if this party supported the Imran government, only three mps would get support
 imran sarkaar ko baluchistan awami party (BAP) kaa bhi samarthan mil saktaa he
 This party has four seats
 to jidie, emcum-pi, piemail-kyuu or avami muslim aadi ko milakar imran ko kul 122 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil hoga, yani iske baavjood unke paas bahumat se 15 sankhya kam hogi
 Even so many independents have not won

 Batting first after losing the Sunrisers toss, he was able to score 126 runs for six wickets, but Steyn, Mishra and Tisara Perera made it mountain like for Pune Warriors
 warirs kii team 18
 Stacked for 104 runs in 5 overs
 tej gendbaaj sten ne 11 ran dekar teen or leg spinner mishra ne 19 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 Perera played the all-round game and scored 30 runs and took two wickets for 29 runs
 match kam score vaala rahaa
 The new IPL team Sunrisers failed to play a big partnership
 uske sheersh kram ke ballebaaj akshat reddy (30 gend par 27 ran), parthiv patel (18 gend par 19) or captain kumaar sangakaara (16 gend par 15 ran) ne krij par paryaapt samay bitaayaa lekin ve badi pari nahin khel paae

 He lost his last six wickets within 17 runs
 inamen se sten ke teen wicket bhi shaamil hai jo unhone chaar gend ke andar liye
 Perera then forced Malren Samuels (five runs off nine balls) to take an easy catch at slip

 Janata Dal (U) President Sharad Yadav attacked former President APJ Abdul Kalam for his comments that in 2004 he was ready to appoint him as Prime Minister despite massive lobbying against Sonia Gandhi

 The JD (U) chief's remarks against Kalam, who became president during the nda's tenure, came after the former president revealed in the book that despite strong political opposition to the issue of foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi in 2004, she i was ready to swear in as Prime Minister without any hesitation
 apni pustak ‘terning points’ main kalam ne yah bhi kaha he ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi 2002 ke dangon ke baad unki gujarat yatra ke paksh main nahin the
 On this comment of Kalam, Congress got an opportunity to question Vajpayee's 'rajdharma' edict on Saturday
 yah salaah vaajapeyi ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko di thi
 Sharad also asked why Kalam remained silent for eight years when rumors and discussions continued in the political world
 ’sharad ne kaha, ‘sanvaidhanik pramukh ko sach tabhi bolnaa chahie jab isaki jarurat ho
 There is no point in speaking on the voice of the conscience when it interests you
 gandhi ji apni intaraatma ke anuroop tatkaal bolaa karte the
 Why did he (kalam) kill his conscience (voice) at that time
 ’ jad (you) pramukh ne aath saal baad sach bolne kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha
 He said, 'the truth should be spoken only when it is needed
 yadi yah tab bolaa jaataa he jab isaki jarurat nahin ho to yah dikhaava hota he
 It is the responsibility of the person sitting in Rashtrapati Bhavan to speak the truth in these circumstances and not wait for any opportunity to speak the truth

 ye jo ghatana hamaare sangyaan main ai he, ye ardblyoo or chhath ghat banane waalon ke bich vivaad he
 Now anyone who gets the permission of the district will do it
 isamen raajnneeti karne kaa kya faaydaa?manoj tiwari ne arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vaise to aap chhath vrath waalon ko jahaan se ve aate hai unhen bhagane kii bhi niyat rakhte hai
 They are also called illegal intruders
 AAP par do samudaayon ko ladaane kaa aropamanoj tiwari ne kaha ki mujhe is ghatana ke bare main pataa chalaa he
 Let the local people understand the problem of the local people
 saath hi yah bhi kaha ki aam aadmi party yahi chaahati he ki do samudaay lard jaaen, inaki nafrat kii raajnneeti he
 Manoj Tiwari said, "sanjay Singh Ji, Arvind Kejriwal ji, come, Jamuna, who has stopped you from doing Chhath?" baba sahab ambedkar kaa park he, jahaan chhath puja ke naam pe vivaad kar rahe ho to vivaad hi hoga na
 We have called both sides

 Now they are engaged in fighting two sides in the colonies, it is very condemnable

 At the same time, Sidhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) also asked PM Modi about the number of terrorists killed
 unhone twit kar kaha ki 40 jawan shahid hue, kitne aantki mare? 56 inch kaa seenaa kahaan gaya? navjot singh siddhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) ne modi sarkaar ko lekar ek shaayari bhi likhi
 He wrote that the emphasis of Talim is so much, why the noise of Tehzeeb is so much, why is there no Barkat, there is a malfunction in your intention
 aam aadmi party ke baagi vidhayak vinod binni ne apni party or arvind kejariwal par jamkar nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki dilli sarkaar kii kathani or kerani main bahut antar he or dilli kii janata ke saath dhokhaa ho rahaa he
 He accused Arvind Kejriwal of behaving like a dictator and said that Kejriwal is close to the Congress and wants to enjoy the power of power
 unhone kaha ki bijli or pani ke mudde par party ne apane ghoshnaptr main jo baat kahi thi, us par amal karne main chaturaai barti ja rahi he
 It was a matter of forgiving the entire water bill, but it was not done
 bijli bill aadha karne par bhi dilli sarkaar ne apana rukh badal liya
 Binny accused senior leaders of the party - Arvind Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh, Kumar Vishwas and Manish Sisodia - and said that they are all childhood friends and together they are creating a drama in the country
 party chhodane ke sawaal par binni ne kaha ki yah party kisi vyakti vishesh kii party nahin he, isliye main party nahin chhoduunga
 However, he said that if my allegations were proved to be false, i will quit my post
 binni ne kaha ki agar kejariwal dilli kii janata ke saath kiye gaye chunavi vaadon ko puraa karne main sakasham nahin hai, to unhen mukhyamantri pad se istipha de dena chahie
 He said that the 'aam Aadmi Party' was not formed to make an MLA or MP, but its promises have changed after coming to power
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party raishumaari main zyada yakeen karti he, isliye main aagrah karuunga ki dilli kii janata se bijli or pani ke mudde par bhi sarkaar raishumaari karaae
 On the Jan Lokpal bill issue, Binny said that the Aam Aadmi Party had promised that the bill would be passed within 14 days of forming the government, but it has not been done so far, so they should clear their intention
 unhone kaha, mujhe kisi pad kii laalasaa nahin he
 He accused Kejriwal of dictatorial behavior and said that four-five people in the party take decisions in closed quarters and Arvind Kejriwal orders them
 binni ne aarope lagaaya ki kejariwal congress saasand sandip dikshit ke kareebi hai or kejariwal congress ke adeshon ko maanate hai
 He alleged that corruption was also done in the distribution of tickets and the Lok Sabha tickets are already fixed
 binni ne kaha, hamane saarvajanik rup se ghoshnaa kii thi ki ham na to kisi raajnneetik dal kaa samarthan lenge or na hi denge
 What happened then was that the party had to change the decision
 mudde par band daravaaje ke peeche charchaa chal rahi thi
 He announced that if the party fails to fulfill its promises by 27 January, he will go on hunger strike
 apni sarkaar or party kii ninda karne ko 'sach ke liye ladaai' qaraar dete hue binni ne kaha ki 'aap' kii sthapana satta hasil karne yaa kisi ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye nahin hui thi
 He said, the party has misled the people of Delhi on many issues
 party dwaara kiye gaye vaadon or sarkaar dwaara kii ja rahi chizon main kaaphi antar he
 The MLA also pulled up ministers of the Delhi government who took 'big cars' and had 'fancy number' plates
 unhone kaha ki yah party ke siddhanton ke khilaaf he
 Binny also targeted Kejriwal, saying that due to the criticism of the people, the Chief Minister had to leave the plush flat in compulsion
 baagi tevar akhriyaar karne vaale vidhayak ne kaha, yadi logon kii taraf se virodh nahin hua hota, to vah (mukhyamantri) nishchit taur par flats main chale gaye hote
 Binny has kept a rebel tone since Wednesday
 unka kahana he ki party muddon se bhatak gai he or sarkaar un vaadon ko puraa karne kii disha main kaam nahin kar rahi he, jinke dam par jitkar vah satta main pahunchi he
 At the same time, the party's national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Binny first wanted to get a ministerial position in the Delhi government and after that he demanded a Lok Sabha ticket and he got angry with the party for not getting the ticket
 haalanki jab binni se is par safai maangi gai, to unhone kaha ki kejariwal jhooth bol rahe hai or unhone kabhi kisi pad kii laalasaa nahin kii he
 The main opposition party attacked the BJP as soon as the differences within the Aam Aadmi Party came to the fore, while the Congress has described it as an internal matter of the party
 aisa nahin he ki binni pehali baar aam aadmi party ke liye sirdard bane hai
 Earlier, he was angered by Kejriwal's lack of a ministerial berth in the cabinet
 haalanki us samay kejariwal ne binni ke naaraaz hone kii khabaron kaa khandan kiya tha or party ke aalaa netaaon kii koshishon ke baad binni ko manaa liya gaya tha
