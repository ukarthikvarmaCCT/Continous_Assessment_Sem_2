 Prior to this, Naipaul had been describing East versus West in his own way, and Edward Saeed's power to digest Orientalism was limited to some of the secular intellectuals in Europe
 snow darasal ek upanyaas hokar bhi political discorse tha
 Now the Hindi translation of Snow has been published and once again the cultural struggle of East and West and all political questions are at the center of the debate
 snow ek kavi ‘k’ kii kahani he, jo germany main 12 saal nirvaasan main bitaane ke baad apane mulk turki lautaa he

 The scale of being a British European is clear - considering the Third World not only poor, weak and innocent, but culturally backward

 Blue Kamal is the antithesis of Ataturk and Europe

 Before Snow, it was a little complicated to understand that even so many screws are possible in the fight between the hardcore and secular forces

 sarkaar aspataal or swasthya centre sanchalit kar apane kartavyon kaa nirvahan karti he or un logon ko medical suvidha muhaiyaa karaati he jo isaki maang karte hai

 And may also file a contempt of court case

 supreme court ne mana ki, ‘sarkari aspataalon ke adhikariyon ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 ke tahat hakim shaikh ko mili jivan kii suraksha adhikaar kii guarantee kaa ulanghan kiya
 'the court said,' The state cannot refuse to give constitutional authority to Hakim Sheikh

 samiti kii report ke baad tatkaaleen rajya sarkaar ne aspataalon ke liye kai nirdesh jari kiye the
 Professional liability to treat However, in a similar case, the Supreme Court says that Article 21 of the Constitution provides the state with the obligation to protect life
 court ke mutabik, ‘prayek doctor chaahe vah sarkari ho yaa privet practice karata ho, uskaa peshewar daayitv he ki vah apni visheshgya ke jariye maanav jivan kii raksha kare
 No law or state may interfere with the discharge of its medical profession obligations to members associated with the medical profession

 '' yogesh mishra kii pustak ‘samay ke aalekh’ vastav main samay ke dastavej hi he
 Period saga of almost a historical era
 isamen se bhi un muddon or chintaaon ko mile ke pathar kii bhaanti shabdaakaar chitrit kar sakane kii kshamta nishchay hi lekhak yogesh mishra kii samvednaa or rachanadharmita ko vishesh darja pradaan karti he
 The first article of the time article started with the sentiment of farewell, the anxious question journey is lasting till the last step of the book is ignored by the lyricist is amazing in itself
 kisi bhi lekhak kii yah sabase badi uplabdhi maani jaati he ki us samay ko vah kitna or kii tarah se chitrit kar paata he
 Here i have no hesitation in writing that Yogesh ji has coined the time in these essays
 unako samay ke aage chale jane kaa utana dard nahin he jitna kii samay kii jatiltaayen or vikrutiyaan unako pareshaan karti he
 For example, do not make Ambedkar a weapon, the narrow democracy of the courtyard, Jana Gana Mana, the Indian language, the beauty standing in the market, the story of valor in the world will remain, the implications of being a Hindu, the spots of our republic, Kabir's Maghar title The hurt and suffering of essays becomes saliva as the pain of every ordinary Indian
 haalank ye niabandh kisi khaas samay par likhe gaye he lekin inaki atishay sampreshniyata or praasangikta lekhak ke falak se rubaru karaane main behad sanjeeda jaan padate he
 a great feature of Yogesh's style of writing is that he communicates with every word
 isse inke niabandh or bhi praasangik ban jate hai
 Achuthananda Mishra's comment in the role of the book is quite accurate that Yogesh has taken the bold initiative of positive intervention through this book
 lalit nibandhon kii style or bunaavat, gahari pidaa, aaveg ke saath visangatiyon par chot or kaavyatmak gadhy kaa aakarshan in lekhon kii pathneeyata ko or bhi ruchikar bana detaa he
 Yogesh's conceptual face is very broad
 samayik prakaashan nai dilli se prakashit yogesh mishra kii yah pustak vastav main samay kaa hi aalekh he

 This was surprising because when the stock market celebrates, it includes everyone

 The biggest example of this is Reliance Industries, the country's largest private company, whose shares remained there for a month
 agar yah badhotaree samaan rup se hoti to samajha ja saktaa tha

 Rajnath said - be present in the house MP: Union Defense Minister Singh Rajnath Singh asked BJP mps to be present in large numbers when Home Minister Amit Shah introduced the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 unhone kaha ki sansad main party saansadon ke anupasthit rahane ko gambhirtha se liya jayega
 He dismissed the opposition's criticisms on the Citizenship Amendment Bill and said that BJP always works to unite the country and the people
 rajnath singh ke alaava bijepi saansad arjuna singh ne kaha kinaagarikta sanshodhan bilbehad jaruri he
 That is why this bill will be passed in this session

 The northeast states are the most opposed to the citizenship amendment bill
 purvottar ke logon ke ek bade tabake or sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki yah bill aane ke baad 1985 main hue assam samjhaute ke praavdhaanon ko prabhaavaheen kar degaa
 The agreement calls for the deportation of all illegal migrants after March 24, 1971, regardless of their religion
 congress, tiemasi, sipiem or kuch anya raajnneetik partiyaan bhi is vidheyak kaa virodh kar rahi hai or unka kahana he ki dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta nahin di ja sakati he
 The bjp-led NDA had introduced and passed this amendment bill in the Lok Sabha in its last tenure, but could not introduce it in the Rajya Sabha due to strong opposition in the Northeast
 loksabhaa ke bhang hone kii vajah se vidheyak nishprabhavi ho gaya tha
 Now there is a BJP government under the leadership of Narendra Modi in the power of the Center, in such a situation the government is going to bring this bill once again

 a bouquet is placed on the side table, which may have been given to Modi a while back
 in tasveeron main sushamaa swaraj ko bhi hona tha
 But he had to go to his constituency
 lihaaza is baithak se pehle dilli main hi rajnath singh or nitin gadakari ne unase mulaakaat kar lee thi
 Modi, Jaitley, Rajnath Singh and Gadkari, including Sushma, would be more correct if they were called the core group of the next Modi government
 agar in tasveeron kaa milan 10 saal pehle loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke pehle 7, rescorse road par tab hui baithak kii tasveeron se karen, to badali bijepi saaf dikhaai degi
 The pictures will then feature LK Advani, Jaswant Singh, Murali Manohar Joshi and Pramod Mahajan along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 10 saal main yamuna main kaaphi pani bah gaya
 The BJP has also changed
 balki bijepi main pichley 10 saal main jitna badlaav nahin hua hoga, utana 16 may ke baad se hoga
 The foundation for this change was laid on September 13 last year, when the bjp's parliamentary board announced Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 uske baad se jis mehnat, lagan or patibaddhta ke saath modi ne puure desh main party kaa jhanda buland kiya he, uski misaal milani mushkil he
 There was only one issue in this Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi
 or agar bijepi ko jeet milti he, to iskaa sehara bhi sirf unheen ke sir bandhegaa
 But now if the government is to be formed, then obviously everyone will have to work with them
 mantrimandal main kisi rakhana he or kise nahin, yah pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar hota he
 The BJP has been accusing the UPA of having two centers of power, saying that Sonia Gandhi lowered the dignity of the Prime Minister's Office
 aise main is baat kii atkal lagaana ki modi par bijepi yaa aresas ke varisht netaa apni pasand thope sakate hai, mumkin nahin lagata
 It is important to remember that despite the rss's refusal, Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave the responsibility of Finance Ministry to Jaswant Singh
 lekin modi ke liye laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi jaise diggaj netaaon ke liye bhoomika tay karnaa tedi kheer sabit hoga
 The RSS wanted both these leaders to go to the Rajya Sabha instead of contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin donon ne isse saaf inkaar kar diya
 Rather these two leaders were not happy with Modi being made the Prime Ministerial candidate
 adwani zyaada naaraaz the ki unke rahete hue kisi or ko piem ummidavaar kaise banaaya ja saktaa he
 Now again the same question has come up
 kya adwani or joshi isliye chunaav lade ki ve modi sarkaar main mantri bananaa chaahate the? agar nahin, to phir sambhavit sarkaar main unki kya bhoomika hogi
 Close to Advani has indicated that Advani does not want to join the Modi government, but he is not averse to taking constitutional post like Lok Sabha Speaker
 vahiin yah tay he ki joshi bhi sarkaar main nahin rahenge
 a dilemma about Advani is that he is currently the acting president of the NDA and also the president of the BJP parliamentary party
 jab tak bijepi vipaksh main thi or yah tay nahin tha ki party main sheershasth netaa koun he, tab tak adwani kaa in donon padon par rahanaa koi dikkat paidaa nahin karata tha
 But if Modi becomes the Prime Minister and Advani continues to hold both these positions, then the danger of challenging the rights of Modi again will remain
 khaskar tab jabaki modi ko lekar adwani samay-samay par apni aprasannataa vyakt karte rahe hai
 As Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the president of the NDA and also the leader of the parliamentary party
 koi kaaran nahin he ki bataur pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ye donon pad na milen
 Whereas, after holding a constitutional post like Speaker, Advani will neither be able to interfere in the internal workings of the government and the party nor will it be compatible with the dignity of that constitutional post
 spikar kaa pad bhi behad samvedansheel hota he
 Especially in coalition government
 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar sirf ek vot se giri thi
 The tdp's GMC Balayogi was the speaker and allowed Giridhar Gamang, the then Chief Minister of Orissa, to vote
 raajnneeti main adwani ne pehla pad spikar kaa hi liya tha
 In the Metropolitan Council of Delhi
 ab apane kariyar ke antim padaav par bhi vah yahi pad chaahate hai
 But this time of the Lok Sabha
 dekhnaa hoga party kya faisla karti he
 Ankit Kumar Rai, a student of Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University, lodged a complaint at the Vasant Kunj police station against eight people, including Najeeb's mother, who was missing
 chaatr kaa aarope he ki najeeb kii maa or unke saath aae logon ne uske saath gaali-galoch karne ke saath dhamkee di he
 Complainant Ankit said, 'on Wednesday, Najeeb's mother, her lawyer and some more people came to the Mahi Hostel of JNU

 An attempt was made to force him to spit that he killed Najeeb and broke his head

 Director Nirav Ghosh's film 'soundtrack' not released on September 30 is the reason for its lead actress Soha Ali Khan and not many films on that date
 soha ke pita mansoor ali khan pataudi ke intkaal ke baad ab yah film saat oktober ko pradarshit hogi
 While Soha was campaigning for her film, her father was admitted in the hospital, but even after that, she continued her promotion program across the country to strengthen herself
 baad main pita ke nidhan par vah buree tarah tut gayi or unke liye film ke vishay main sochna bhi mushkil tha
 The film's production company Saregama and director Nirav Ghosh had two options
 ve yaa to soha ke bina film kaa prachaar karte yaa phir film kaa pradarshan taal dete
 He considered avoiding postponement better
 film kaa pradarshan talane kii aupchaarik vajah us taarikh par kai filmon kaa pradarshan bataai gai thi
 Ghosh says, "certainly it is not because of the performance of many films because we were promoting our film
 pradarshan talane kii vajah soha hai
 We all, Rajiv Khandelwal, Mrinalini Sharma, Soha are like a family
 yadi hamamen se koi bhi tanaav main yaa pareshaani main he to baaki log acha mahasoos nahin kar sakate
 We postponed the performance due to Soha's misery

 chand par duusari baar landing kii taiyaariexport cametiyon ne kii sifarishabhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (indian Space Research Organization - ISRO) ne chandrayan-3 (chandrayaan-3) ko apni taiyaari shuru kar di he
 But it will take at least three years
 isro ke vishwast sutron ne bataaya ki agle saal tak chandrayan-3 kii lonching karnaa lagbhag naammumkin he
 Because, it will take at least three years to prepare its lander, rover, rocket and payloads
 media main khabaren chal rahi hai ki chandrayan-2 ko november-2020 tak launch kiya ja saktaa he
 Aajtak in ne 12 sitambar 2019 ko hi bataaya tha ki chandrayan-3 mishan kaisaa hoga?isro ke ahmedabad centre sthit ek ucch padasth sutara ne Aajtak
 told that it takes at least three years of research to make any new payload
 iske baad uski dizin banati he
 Then development work starts
 agar pehle se bane pelod kaa upyog bhi karte hai to use phir se banaakar viksit karne main kam se kam 6 maheene lagenge
 Suppose we also put four payloads in Chandrayaan-3 lander and 2 in Rover, then it will take about 2 years to build them all
 iske baad in sabhi pelods ko aapas main integrade karne main kareeb 8 maheene se ek saal kaa samay lagata he
 The lander, the rover is then integrated
 lekin bina orbitor ke inhen antariksh main nahin bheja ja saktaa
 Therefore, an orbiter has to be made
 ye ho saktaa he ki orbitor main koi praayogic upkaran na lagaae jaae
 Use it just like a rocket
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki koi pelod nijee company yaa videsh se mangana pade
 This will take more time
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahaho saktaa he ki isro kii kisi samiti ne chandrayan-3 ko lekar sifarish kii he
 But ISRO first sends this recommendation to Ministry of Science, Ministry of Finance and PMO
 sabhi jagahon se anumati milane ke baad mishan ke liye paise kaa alotment hota he
 After this, the work of carrying forward the mission begins
 tab bhi in sabamein kareeb kul milakar 3 se 4 saal kaa samay lagegaa
 Then Chandrayaan-3 mission will be launched somewhere
 agar, chandrayan-3 main chandrayan-2 ke orbitor kaa upyog bhi karenge, tab bhi lander, rover, rocket (PSLV yaa GSLV) banane main bhi samay lagegaa
 So Chandrayaan-3 mission is not possible so soon
 kyonki, ab bhi chandrayan-2 ke data kaa vishleshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, Chandrayaan-2's orbiter will work for seven years
 isliye isro ke paas abhi kaaphi samay he chandrayan-3 mishan ko waapas chand par bhejne ke liye
 98% successful Chandrayaan 2- The question raised by the country's scientists on the claim of ISRO Chief, Chandrayaan-3 may make fewer rounds of the Earth and the Moon, it is possible that the ISRO scientist in Chandrayaan-3 mission will reduce the travel time of Chandrayaan-3
 
 yah karne ke liye use chandrayan-3 ko prithvi or chand kaa kam chakkar lagane laayak bana de
 Also make the feet of the lander more strong
 taaki teji se landing karne par lander ko nuksaan na pahunche
 Don't crash

 Curly hair may look beautiful but it is nothing less than to handle it
 aise baalo ko na to aap bahut der tak kholkar rakh sakate hai or na hi lambey samay tak baandhakar
 Curly hair is more dry than straight hair
 iskaa sabase bada kaaran ye he ki log aksar aise baalo ko manage karne ke liye stritor yuj kar lete hai yaa phir chemical product kaa istemaal karte hai
 If you too have curly hair and don't know the right way to manage them, then there is no need to panic
 in upayon ko apanaakar aap apane ghunghraale baalo ko aasaani se manage kar paaengi
 1: Use a wide-tooth comb instead of a hair brush
 isse bal jaldi sulajh jaaenge or tootenge bhi kam
 2: While combing, solve the confusion from bottom to top
 baalo ke siron par bahut si ganthen ban jaati hai, jinhen sulajhane ke baad hi puure bal main kanghee karen
 3: After applying conditioner to the hair, dip a towel in warm water and squeeze it well
 is tolie ko kuch der tak sir main baandhakar chhod den
 This will allow the conditioner to fit well into the hair
 4:condishnar lagane ke baad hi baalo main kanghee kar len
 After this wash the hair thoroughly
 aisa karne se bal kam ulajhenge
 5: Try not to clean the conditioner completely with your hair because curly hair requires more moisture
 6:dhone ke baad moishcharizer or thodaa sa condishnar mix karke apane baalo par lagaaein
 This will make your hair more smooth
 7:agar aap nahaane se pehle gym yaa jogging karne ja rahi hai to thodaa sa deep condishnar apane baalo main laga ke ban bana len
 The sweat or heat generated in your body will soak up the conditioner so that curly hair will be easily managed

 com / 3tjhuxwkng Honorable Modi ji! You can only speak Modi! Actually what is it that you have given yourself so many names that people get confused by which name to call you
 chywala, fakir, pradhan sevak, chaukeedaar, sahib, or na jane kya-kya!aap swatantra bharat ke pehle aise pradhanmantri hai, jinke kai chehre hai
 Which at their convenience uses those faces to woo voters
 lekin inamen se aapkaa asli cheharaa he koun sa?aap 2014 main chywala ban gaye
 Your PR team sold this image of yours and got votes
 lekin ab tak is baat ke saboot nahin mili hai ki aapane chaay kii kettle ko haath tak lagaaya ho
 Now that you have not sold tea, how have you become a chaiwala? Modi, then India also got the first fakir to wear a suit of one million
 ek aisa fakir jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki mechap main hi hajaaron rupye kharch kar die jate hai
 Your pen, your clothes which are changed many times a day, your breakfast and your food have all been widely discussed
 2000 karod to aapane videsh yatraaon main hi phoonk die or 4600 karod rupye vigyapanon main
 If you see this mystic, then the good fakirs become aware
 baat sirf in 'visheshnon' tak simit nahin he modi ji
 Before 2014, you were anti-black money, anti-corruption, anti-gst, against writing 'love letter' to Pakistan, you wanted to show red eyes to China, were the sons of Ganga Maa, smart cities and Adarsh villages
 Sapna was the selling politician, Swaminathan was a true supporter of the commission report
 lekin 2014 ke baad se hi in sabake vipareet hote chale gaye
 You drove away the black money abroad, became a partner of corruption in Rafale with Anil Ambani, opened the parliament in the middle of the night and passed the GST bill, but it broke the back of the country's business, the condition of the river Ganges is still pathetic, unemployment Has destroyed all the records, you went to Pakistan without calling and came to eat biryani, you were seen swinging with the head of the Chinese, making Banaras Kyoto, then every account 15-15 million "as the phrase proved
 log pahchaan hi nahin paa rahe hai ki aapkaa asli cheharaa koun sa he
 Do you remember what your real face is? Before you wear another mask of lies, i am sending you this mirror gift form
 modi ji! is aaine ko aap lok kalyaan maarg ke apane awaas main kisi aisi jagah lagaaein, jahaan se aap sabase adhik baar guzarate hon
 So that by looking at your face repeatedly in this mirror, you can try to identify your real face
 ho saktaa he ki aap is aaine kaa istemaal hi naa karen
 Throw it in a dustbin at the Prime Minister's residence
 lekin aainaa dekhne se aap phir bhi nahin batch paaenge
 This country's population of 125 crores is going to show you a mirror in this election
 taiyaar hai naa modi ji? These days the Bharatiya Janata Party is engaged in connecting people with the party by running membership campaigns across the country
 lekin isi sadsyta abhiyaan ke bharwaaye ja rahe form ne madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti main vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 In this form, the BJP is also asking the membership members about their caste
 2014 or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ko mili prachand jeet ke peeche yah daawa kiya gaya tha ki bhartiya janata party ko jatigat samikarnon se upar jaakar sabhi jati or varg ke logon ne vot die hai
 Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest laboratory for caste equations in the country, has seen the way the BJP got the votes of all castes in the last two Lok Sabha elections and the assembly elections in the meantime
 BJP has indeed left behind the caste vote bank politics in the country
 lekin ab bhartiya janata party deshbhar main in dinon jo sadsyta abhiyaan chalaa rahi he us main sadsyta lene ke liye bharwaaye ja rahaa form main logon se unki jati kaa varg bhi poocha ja rahaa he
 In the form of membership campaign of 'bharatiya Janata Party', the new members are being asked which caste class they belong to
 form main baqayda iske liye 5 vikalp bhi die gaye hai
 In which the newly created member has to be told that he is from general, OBC, SC, ST or other caste category
 form main jati kaa kolemcongress ne bataaya 'bantwaare kii raajnneeti'bijepi ke sadsyta form main jab jati kaa kollam aayaa to madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti main vivaad khadaa ho gaya or congress ko bijepi par hamalaa karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said, 'the Bharatiya Janata Party has always been doing caste politics
 yah baat alag he ki chunaav main piem modi ko bolte suna tha ki ham jatigat raajnneeti nahin karte or yah raajnneeti bispi or samaajawaadee party karti he
 But the fact is that BJP has always been doing politics of partition in this way and this is the proof that in its membership form, they are asking people from which caste they belong
 'samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko jodengesdsyta form main jati par vivaad badha to sadsyta abhiyaan ke rashtriya prabharee or madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko khud saamne aana padaa
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan termed the allegations of the Congress as stinging and said that the party wants to take every section of the society together and for this all this exercise is being done
 vahiin shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress ko naseehat di ki party pehle apane adhyaksh pad kii khoj ko puraa kar le
 Shivraj said, 'BJP talks to everyone
 jab ham kah rahe hai sab sparshi hai to ham samaaj ke har varg ko jodenge
 What sin are we committing in this? bhartiya janata party samaaj ke har varg ke paas jaaegi or sarvyaapee matlab har booth par jodenge

 With the ringing of the Lok Sabha elections, there has been a ruckus in the political parties
 ek taraf netaa paala badal rahe hai, to tikat ko lekar asantosh bhi dikh rahaa he
 The latest case is related to Mamata Banerjee's party Trinamool Congress
 trinmul congress main tikat vitaran ko lekar asantosh ubhar gaya he
 When Trinamool released its list of 42 candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, voices of discontent also started rising in the party
 is suchi main koochbehaar, bashirhaat, jhaadgram, medinipur, bolpur, vishnupur or krishnanagar loksabhaa siton ke vartmaan saansadon ke naam nahin hai
 In the last five years, the BJP has left no stone unturned to make way for itself, because of the squabbling in these seats under the local leadership of Trinamool

 These days, Congress MLA Rumi Nath's second marriage with Facebook friend Jackie Zakir has become the subject of heated debate between two Assam ministers
 sarahadi vikaas rajyamantri siddiq ahamed or lok swasthya abhiyantriki mantri gautam raay ne ek-duusare par jakir ke saath shaadi karne main rumi kii madad karne kaa aarope lagaaya he jabaki ve kanoonee taur par apane pehle pati se abhi alag bhi nahin hui hai
 This is not the first time that these two giants of the Barak Valley have collided in public
 darasal, donon ke bich kshetra kaa nirvivaad netaa banane kii hode lagi he
 In January, Ahmed and Rai had a fight at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the FM station of Akashwani at Intapur in Karimganj, Ahmed's home district
 pehle se hi shaadishuda or do saal kii ek bacchee kii maa 33 varshiya rumi or karimganj jile ke bhaanga ke samaaj kalyaan vibhaag main loar divijan assistant 29 varshiya jakir 22 may ko silchar se gaayab ho gaye, or uske baad 4 june ko guwahati sthit rumi ke sarkari awaas main hi najar aae
 Rumi admitted to having a second marriage but denied reports that she had become a Muslim
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''maine islam main dharmantaran nahin kiya he
 i have adopted it only to marry
 ahamed ne hi jakir ke saath shaadi karne main meri madad kii or ab ve hi mere dharmantaran kii khabar failaa rahe hai
 '' Rumi is a doctor and she still has her first husband, Dr
 rakesh kumaar singh ko talaak nahin diya he
 Dr
 Natives of Uttar Pradesh
 rakesh kumaar singh ab apana kaarobaar karte hai
 Rumi's marriage with Zakir first came to light in the second week of April when her Facebook profile status was updated by writing 'married to Jackie Zakir'
 us samay unhone is khabar ko yah kahkar khaarij kar diya tha ki unki profile hack kar lee gai thi
 Ahmed has denied his role in the wedding, saying that Zakir called Rai after the wedding on 13 April
 ahamed kehete hai, ''us samay main, ek anya mantri ke saath raay ke hi saath tha
 When Zakir called, Rai turned on the phone's loudspeaker to tell us
 '' raay ne ahamed ke aaropon par pratikriya vyakt karne se inkaar kar diya
 "whatever they want to say, say it," he told India Today
 mujhe parvaah nahin he
 "this issue has taken a communal color
 bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad kii sthaneey ikaayiyon ko lagata he ki rumi ne apane sampradaay ko kalankit kiya he
 Nrumata Bhairab Seva Samiti, a temple committee of Barkhola, has sued her before the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Cachar in June, alleging that she had married her before marrying a Muslim and eventually eloping with Zakir
 Visiting temples in her constituency with husband has hurt religious sentiments
 rumi ke pehle pati ne chori or gaiyrkanoonee shaadi kaa iljaam lagaate hue un par silchar satr nyaayalay main ek mukadmaa daayar kiya he to rumi ne dispur police stesan main yah kehete hue ek javaabi arji daakhil kii he ki dow
 Rakesh Kumar Singh harassed him physically and mentally
 rumi ne 2004 main silchar jile kii barkhola seat se bhaajapa ke tikat par vidhansabha chunaav jeeta tha
 But in 2010, she was expelled from the BJP for cross-voting in order to benefit the Congress in the Rajya Sabha elections
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ne unhen tikat dekar puraskrit kiya or ve dobaaraa jeet gayi
 Now the Silchar District Congress Committee has written a letter to the State Congress Committee President Bhubaneswar Kalita to take action against Rumi
 rumi kahati hai, ''meri shaadi main dilchaspee lene kii bajaae party ke logon ke paas karne ke liye or bhi behatar kaam hai
 '' teen talaaq par taiyaari ke dauraan kai lekhon main media khaskar news channelon ko lekar ek khiz dikhaai di
 That is that the media especially TV has changed the issue of triple talaq to yes or no
 jabaki yah maamla haa yaa naa ke alaava un vikalpon kaa bhi he jo teen talaak kii samaapti ke baad ho saktaa he, jise lekar tamaam sanghathanon ke bich alag alag raay he
 News channels do this injustice not only with Muslim issues but also with all political and non-religious issues
 iskaa ab kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 The purpose of TV debates is to get angry
 na ki aapaki raay ko pehle se behatar bataanaa
 You must have understood this much so far
 iske liye metric paas hone kii bhi zarurat nahin he
 The PDP is the BJP government in Jammu and Kashmir
 mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti kai baar tathakthith rashtriya media se guzarish kar chuki hai ki dibet main is tarah se charchaa na karen ki jammu kashmir ke logon ke prati bharat main nafrat fail jaae
 There is a lot of difference in the opinion of Muslim women's organizations regarding triple talaq
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan chahta he ki twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho magar uniform civil code na thopa jaae
 Instead, the procedure of divorce in the Qur'an should be applied only to the Sunnis
 muslim vimens lig kii maang he ki muslim mahilaon par dharmik kanoon lagu hi na ho
 Sharia law should be repealed and Indian Marriage Law should be replaced instead
 shaayara bano teen talak ko asanvaidhanik maanati hai or unifarm civil code kii maang karti hai
 This means that there are many types of anxiety in the world of Muslim women at this time
 ek bechaini apane masale kaa hal koran ke daayre main chaahati he to duusari bechaini apane masale kaa hal kanoon ke siddhant ke anusaar chaahati he
 In a way, it is clear among Muslim women that except the Shariah either the Qur'an is in force or the constitution is in force, the instant triple talaq should be ended
 yah baat bhi thik nahin he ki moulana log bhi ek hi tarah se is bahes main shaamil hai
 Many Maulana or Islamic scholars want the quick triple talaq to end
 hilaal ahamed ne apane lekh main moulanaon ke bich kitne prakaar kii bahes he uski suchi pesh kii he, - Ahle Hadith Sunni states that triple talaq has no religious basis, but does not challenge the Personal Law Board
 - board se jude kai paaramparik ulema teen talaak ko dharmik or kanoonee aadhaar par sahi maanate rahe hai
 - The board has now considered three divorces wrong at once, but has made the process of divorce long and difficult
 yah ladaai is baat ko lekar bhi he ki mahilaon yaa bhartiya musalamaanon ke jivan par koran kii sarvocchata lagu ho yaa caliphaaon ke daur main koran or haddees kii vyakhya ke baad jo saamaajik niyam bane hai jise aap sharia kehete hai wo lagu ho
 You also have to understand that along with the Quran, Sharia has also been a part of Islamic law
 yah sahi baat he ki islam ek he or koran ek he magar islam ke tahat alag alag panth hai, firake hai or unke apane apane sharia hai
 Sharia means the way of life
 motaa moti yah samajhaye ki sadak par chalate vakt kya saavdhaanee apanaai jaae, iskaa zikr to kuran main nahin he lekin aap sadak par chalate vakt apane sanvaidhanik zimmedaariyon se bhi alag nahin hai to kya karenge
 Will follow the rule
 yahi niyam sharia kehalaata he
 Hilal Ahmed has written that if there is such a strong emphasis on Sharia under which some people support the triple talaq, then are they ready to get their hands off on stealing

 Rahi Innocent Raza wrote on the Muslims of India, that if three divorces are allowed according to the Shari'a, then why would they not accept punishment for stealing their hands according to that
 lau kamishan of india ke purv chairman taahir mahmud ne indian express main likhaa he ki teen talaak kii jagah ek talaak bhi ho to bhi whatsap, email se talaaq dene kii beemaari rah hi jaaegi
 Therefore, the process of unilateral lock should end
 mard kii marji se talaq na ho
 In the article by Tahir Mahmood and Vice Chancellor Faizan Mustafa of Nalsar, Hyderabad, it emerges prominently that Parliament also has an important role in this change
 twarit teen talaak kii samaapti ke baad nai vyavastha kya ho, sabhi pakshon ko manzur ho iske liye koi cameti baithe or phir vidhaayi prakriya shuru ho
 Tahir Mahmud also considers the role of the court as in 1995, the court prohibited non-muslims from adopting Islam to get a second marriage
 is bahes kaa ek or pahalu he ki muslim personal lau sara kaa sara sharia nahin he
 There are three Acts which have legislative recognition under Personal Law
 muslim personal lau aplication act 1937, dizolution of muslim marriage act 1939, muslim vuman (protection of ritis on divorce) act 1986
 The Acts of 1937 and 1939 were created by the British, which was called Anglo Mohammedan Law before independence, after independence started to be called Muslim Personal Law
 muslim personal lau board sanvaidhanik sanstha nahin he
 Nor can these boards guarantee constitutional rights
 kai log lau board naam hone se kanphyus ho jate hai ki ise sanvaidhanik yaa kanoonee manyata hasil he
 By the way, many people believe that there is a great need for improvement in these three acts too
 ek badlaav or aayaa he
 Rapid triple talaq is a fight started by Muslim women, Muslim men stayed away from it for a long time but today a large number of Muslim men are with women in this fight
 aap twarit teen talaak ke kilaaf likhane waalon ke naam dekh lijie, javed anand, aarif mohammad khan, shahid siddiki, hilaal ahamed, taahir mahmud, faizan mustafaa
 Now let us know that the Supreme Court has fixed the scope of this debate as soon as it starts hearing
 twarit teen talaaq legal he yaa nahin, is par sunwaayee hogi
 The bench will see whether triple talaq is a fundamental part of Islam
 kya ise dharmik swatantraaa ke aadhaar par moulik adhikaar mana ja saktaa he
 If the triple talaq comes under religious freedom, the court will not interfere
 iske baad zarurat padi to halaala par sunwaayee hogi magar bahuvivaah par sunwaayee nahin hogi
 The comments supreme court pakistan samet duusare deshon ke kanoon bhi dekhegaa jahaan teen talaaq khatm kiya gaya he
 In more than 20 countries, three divorces have been abolished
 hindi ke darshak vaani prakaashan ke pratimaan main chape amarine kaa lekh pard sakate hai
 Iraq had issued the Marriage Code in 1959, changing the law of divorce, marriage and marriage
 syria main 1953 main aise badlaav kiye gaye the
 Algeria also issued an ordinance in 1959 bringing all types of divorces to court
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) teen talaaq ko lekar muslim mahila sanghathanon kii raay main hi kaaphi fark he
 The Indian Muslim Women's Movement wants an immediate triple talaq to end but the Uniform Civil Code is not imposed
 isaki jagah koran main talaaq kii jo prakriya he use hi sunniyon par lagu kiya jaae
 The Muslim Women's League demands that religious law should not be imposed on Muslim women
 sharai kanoon radd kar diya jaae or uski jagah indian marriage lau banaaya jaae
 Shaira Bano considers the three talaqs to be unconstitutional and demands a uniform civil code
 iske do matlab hue ki muslim mahilaon kii duniya main is vakt kai tarah kii bechainiyaan hai
 One restlessness wants a solution to its issue within the Qur'an's scope, while another restlessness seeks a solution to its issue according to the principle of law
 ek tarah se muslim mahilaon ke bich yah baat spasht he ki sharia ko chhod yaa to koran lagu ho yaa samvidhan lagu ho, twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho
 It is also not true that the Maulana people are also involved in this debate in the same way
 bahut se moulana yaa islamic vidwaan yah chaahate hai ki twarit teen talaaq samaapt ho jaae
 Hilal Ahmed in his article has presented a list of the types of debate between the Maulanas, - ahale haddees sunni kehete hai ki teen talaak kaa koi dharmik aadhaar nahin he, lekin ve personal lau board ko chalange nahin karte hai
 - Many traditional ulema associated with the board have considered the triple talaq right on religious and legal grounds
 - board ne ab jaakar ek baar main teen talaaq ko galat mana he, lekin talaaq kii lambii or mushkil prakriya banaai he
 This fight is also about whether the supremacy of the Quran should apply to the lives of women or Indian Muslims, or the social rules that you call Sharia after the interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith in the Caliphate era
 aapako yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki koran ke saath saath sharia bhi to islamic kaanoon kaa hissaa rahaa hi he
 It is true that Islam is one and the Qur'an is one, but under Islam there are different creeds, firings and their own Sharia
 sharia kaa matlab hota zindagi kaa rasta
 Fat fat, understand that the caution is to be taken while walking on the road, it is not mentioned in the Quran, but what will you do if you are not separated from your constitutional responsibilities while walking on the road
 niyam kaa paalan karenge
 This rule is called Sharia
 hilaal ahamed ne likhaa he ki agar shariat par itnaa hi jor he jiske tahat teen talaak kaa kuch log samarthan karte hai to kya ve chori karne par haath katwane ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 In the 80s, the famous and prolific writer Rahi Masoom Raza wrote an article in Hans magazine, which he said he needed in the Islam Katpees
 raahi maasoom raza ne bharat ke musalamaanon par tanj karte hue likhaa tha ki shariat ke hisaab se teen talaaq agar manzur he to usee ke hisaab se chori karne par haath katwane kii sazaa kyon nahin manzur kar lete
 Former chairman of the Law Commission of India, Tahir Mahmood has written in the Indian Express that even if there is a divorce instead of three divorces, whatsapp will continue to be divorced by email
 isliye ekatarfa talaq kii prakriya samaapt honi chahie
 Don't be locked by the will of the man
 taahir mahmud or nalsar, hyderabad ke vaais chancelar faizan mustafaa ke lekh main yah baat pramukhataa se ubhartee he ki is badlaav main sansad kii bhi ahm bhoomika he
 After the end of the quick triple talaq, what should be the new arrangement, all the parties agree to it and a committee should sit and then the legislative process starts
 taahir mahmud court kii bhoomika bhi maanate hai jaise 1995 main court ne hi gair musalamaanon ko duusari shaadi karne ke liye islam apnaane par roak laga di thi
 Another aspect of this debate is that Muslim personal law is not all Sharia of Sara
 personal lau ke tahat teen act aise hai jise vidhaayi manyata hasil he
 Muslim Personal Law Application Act 1937, Resolution of Muslim Marriage Act 1939, Muslim Woman (protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986
 1937 or 1939 kaa act angrezon ne banaaya tha jise azaadi ke pehle anglo mohammaden lau kehete the, azaadi ke baad muslim personal lau kahalaane laga
 The Muslim Personal Law Board is not a constitutional body
 na hi ye board sanvaidhanik adhikaar dilaane kii guarantee de saktaa he
 Many people are confused by the name of the Law Board whether it has constitutional or legal recognition
 vaise kai log maanate hai ki in teenon act main bhi sudhaar kii bahut zarurat he
 a change has come
 twarit teen talaak muslim mahilaon kii shuru kii gai ladaai he, lambey arse tak muslim mard isse dur rahe lekin aaj is ladaai main badi sankhya main muslim mard auraton ke saath hai
 Look at the names of those writing against instant triple talaq, Javed Anand, Arif Mohammad Khan, Shahid Siddiqui, Hilal Ahmed, Tahir Mahmood, Faizan Mustafa
 ab bataa den ki supreme court ne sunwaayee shuru karte hi is bahes kaa dayera tay kiya he
 There will be a hearing on whether quick triple talaq is legal or not
 peeth ye dekhegi ki teen talaaq kya islam kaa mul ang he
 Can it be considered a fundamental right on the basis of religious freedom
 agar teen talaaq dharmik swatantraaa ke tahat aayega to court dakhal nahin degaa
 After this, if required, there will be a hearing on Hallala but there will be no hearing on polygamy
 tippaniyan The Supreme Court will also look into the laws of other countries including Pakistan where three divorces have been abolished
 20 se adhim mulkon main teen talaaq ko samaapt kar diya gaya he
 The audience of Hindi can read the article of Amreen printed in the pattern of Vani Prakashan
 iraq ne 1959 main talaaq, niqaah, kanoon ko badalakar vivaah samhita jari kii thi
 Such changes were made in Syria in 1953
 1959 main alzyria ne bhi ek adhyadesh jari kar sabhi prakaar ke talaaq ko court ke daayre main laa diya tha
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) This means that there are many types of anxiety in the world of Muslim women at this time
 ek bechaini apane masale kaa hal koran ke daayre main chaahati he to duusari bechaini apane masale kaa hal kanoon ke siddhant ke anusaar chaahati he
 In a way, it is clear among Muslim women that except the Shariah either the Qur'an is in force or the constitution is in force, the instant triple talaq should be ended
 yah baat bhi thik nahin he ki moulana log bhi ek hi tarah se is bahes main shaamil hai
 Many Maulana or Islamic scholars want the quick triple talaq to end
 hilaal ahamed ne apane lekh main moulanaon ke bich kitne prakaar kii bahes he uski suchi pesh kii he, - Ahle Hadith Sunni states that triple talaq has no religious basis, but does not challenge the Personal Law Board
 - board se jude kai paaramparik ulema teen talaak ko dharmik or kanoonee aadhaar par sahi maanate rahe hai
 - The board has now considered three divorces wrong at once, but has made the process of divorce long and difficult
 yah ladaai is baat ko lekar bhi he ki mahilaon yaa bhartiya musalamaanon ke jivan par koran kii sarvocchata lagu ho yaa caliphaaon ke daur main koran or haddees kii vyakhya ke baad jo saamaajik niyam bane hai jise aap sharia kehete hai wo lagu ho
 You also have to understand that along with the Quran, Sharia has also been a part of Islamic law
 yah sahi baat he ki islam ek he or koran ek he magar islam ke tahat alag alag panth hai, firake hai or unke apane apane sharia hai
 Sharia means the way of life
 motaa moti yah samajhaye ki sadak par chalate vakt kya saavdhaanee apanaai jaae, iskaa zikr to kuran main nahin he lekin aap sadak par chalate vakt apane sanvaidhanik zimmedaariyon se bhi alag nahin hai to kya karenge
 Will follow the rule
 yahi niyam sharia kehalaata he
 Hilal Ahmed has written that if there is such a strong emphasis on Sharia under which some people support the triple talaq, then are they ready to get their hands off on stealing
 80 ke dashak main mashhoor or shandaar lekhak raahi maasoom raza ne hans patrika main ek lekh likhaa jiskaa unvaan tha inhen islam catapis main chahie

 ) a minor dispute broke out between the two groups in a minor dispute in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 is dauraan ek police sab inspector samet chaar log gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye
 The incident took place in Khatoli district of Muzaffarnagar
 ek sthaneey police adhikari ne bataaya ki beeti der shaam kasbe main ek i-rickshaw bazaar main motorcycle se takaraa gai
 There was a ruckus between the rickshawler and the bike driver and the matter came to a head
 isi dauraan donon pakshon ke log maukey par aa gaye
 The matter worsened rather than settled
 donon paksh aapas main bhid gaye
 There was a lot of fighting
 maukey par pahunchaa ek police sab inspector bhi issangharshaki chapet main aa gaya
 The police handled the situation using mild force
 is dauraan hinsa main esai samet chaar log ghayal ho gaye
 The police sent everyone to the hospital for treatment
 ghatana ke baad donon pakshon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 Police is preparing to take action against the accused
 abhi tak kisi kii giraftaar kii khabar nahin he
 It is very important to take some time away from the runaway of life
 isliye travel kaa ek nayaa trend 'slo travel' logon kii pasand banataa ja rahaa he
 People now prefer to spend holidays in remote areas where they can travel the whole way on foot or by bicycle
 train se jarney karnaa he yatriyon kii pasandtravel website, trip adwisers kaa maananaa he kitravel kii spikeb dhimi ho gai he or paryatak apane destination ko paas se anubhav karne ke liye flite kii jagah train se travel karnaa pasand karte hai
 Also, they want to do everything that the local people of that place do
 iskaa makasad yahi he ki ve vahaan kii jindagi ar chizon kaa bharpoor majaa le saken
 The purpose is to live every moment
 Now the definition of both travel and tourist is changing
 ab chhuttiyaan mahaj rosemara kii jindagi se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye nahin hai
 People want that they have moments of travel that remain fresh in their mind even after the end of the holiday and keep giving them energy till the next holiday
 local aria ko paas se jaanane kaa anubhavtravel marketing kii field se jude export maanate hai ki yatra karne kaa anubhav hameshaa alag hota he or slo travel to yatra ke har kshan ko apane main kaid kar letaa he
 Slow travel not only relaxes people in this time of rush, but also gives them a chance to live every moment
 loklakhane kaa lutf uthanaor sthaneey nivaasiyon ke saath kuch pal bitaana ek alag hi ehsaas karaata he
 People are beginning to avoid weekend travel, people want to stay away from digital world or need to keep their mind calm, people are now avoiding 'over-the-weekend' travel, where the holidays are over before it starts
 aaj ke yatri bahut advance hai
 They believe in seeing extraordinary things
 bahuton ke liye slo travel kaa matlab he lagjri se dur rahanaa
 For some people who want to do something different, 'slow Travel' means to spend time reading books in a resort in Kashmir and for someone to meditate in a monastery in Himachal
 fishing ho yaa boat riding,lambi paidal yatra hoya lambi train jarney, ye sab slo travel ke plance main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi says that the Congress MLA is very upset with RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii lambii kavayad ke baad bhi bihar congress ke vidhayakon main bharosa nahin he
 In fact, only one of the 27 mlas of the party participated in the program in the first function of the Executive President of Bihar Pradesh Congress recently
 congress alaakaman ne bihar congress ke vidhayakon main tut kii ashanka ko dekhte hughashok choudhary ko pradesh adhyakshapad se hataakar kaukab kadri ko kaaryakari adhyaksh banaaya tha
 Earlier, Ashok Chaudhary was accused of breaking the party and after that when the Executive President came to take charge, only one of the 27 mlas in Sadaqat Ashram reached the program
 susheel modi ke mutabik, jis dalit netaa ko congress alaakaman ne anushaasanheenata ke aarope main hataaya he, uske prati ekajutata prakat karne ke liye 15 vidhayak or emelsi pahunch gaye
 Sushil Modi has told the Congress that the Congress will have to pay the price for supporting Lalru Prasad
 mahagathbandhan sarkaar tuutane ke baad se hi congress tut kii khabar aane lagi thi
 It was reported that 14 mlas under the leadership of state Congress president Ashok Chaudhary have decided to break the Congress
 khabar alaakaman tak pahunchi to phir vidhayakon se alaakaman ne baat kii or baad main tay kiya gaya ki ashok choudhary ko adhyaksh pad se hataa diya jaae
 In his place, till the election of the organization in the party, the Vice President of the party, Kokab Qadri has been appointed as the Executive Chairman
 kadri kii pehali jimmedaari party ko tut se bachaana he, isliye unhone padbhaar sambhalate hi kaha ki party main tut ko bachaane ke liye wo kisi ke pair par bhi gir sakate he
 However, the manner in which the legislators have ignored their function of office, it seems that these appeals should hardly work
 mana ja rahaa he kaaryakari adhyaksh niyukt hone ke kaaran vidhayakon ne zyada bhav unhen nahin diya he, saath hi navaratri ke chalate kai vidhayak apane kshetra main he
 Putrada Ekadashi is celebrated twice a year
 pus shukla paksh ekadshi or shravan shukla paksh ekadshi (ekadashi) donon ko hi putrada ekadshi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the Gregorian calendar, Paush Shukla Paksha Ekadashi falls in December or January, while Putrada Ekadashi of Shravan Shukla Paksha is celebrated in August in the month of Sawan
 putrada ekadshi desh bhar main manaai jaati he lekin uttar bharat main jahaan pus shukla paksh ekadshi ko vishesh rup se manaaya jaataa he, vahiin dakshin bharat main shravan putrada ekadshi (sharavan Putrada Ekadashi) kaa mahatv zyada he
 It is believed that by observing this fast one gets children and after death one attains salvation

 After mounting tension between Lt
 Governor Kiran Bedi and Chief Minister Narayanasamy in Puducherry, Delhi Pradesh Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has targeted the Congress
 dilli main aam aadmi party sarkaar or alji ke bich jhagada kaaphi purana he
 Citing this, Kejriwal is asking the Congress questions
 yahaan ham aapako bataate chalem ki pudducheri main congress ke siem or centre kii bijepi sarkaar kii taraf se niyukt kii gayi alji kiran bedi ke bich kaamkaaj ko lekar aae din vivaad dekhne ko miltaa he
 The situation there is similar to that of Arvind Kejriwalki in Delhi with LG
 is par kejariwal ne twit karte hue poocha ki "congress ko tay karnaa chahie ki kya alji kaa chuni hui sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main hastkshep acha yaa bura he
 After all, how can lg's intervention be good in Delhi and bad in Puducherry "
 aam aadmi party ko philhal congress par aakraamak hote dekha ja saktaa he
 Navendra Sharma, media adviser to Arvind Kejriwal, also writes by tweeting that "congress is the creator of misusing the government's YLG office"
 bijepi ne congress se hi siikhaa he ki kaise chuni hui sarkaar ko pareshaan kiya jaae
 Right now the Chief Minister of Puducherry is learning it the hard way ”
 haalanki ye behad dilachasp he ki dilli alji kaa bijepi conection bataane vaali aam aadmi party ke nishane par congress aa gai he
 Earlier, Arvind Kejriwal and 'AAP' leaders in Delhi have often been accused of obstructing the functioning of the government by calling LG an agent of PM Modi
 dilli sarkaar kii dikkaton par kya bole ashutosh?aam aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh pudducheri main kiran bedi or narayansami ke bich chal rahi tanatani ke hawaale se dilli ke alji par hamalaa bol rahe hai
 They say that BJP is not letting the government run smoothly through LG within Delhi in the same way as the Congress in Puducherry
 aise main dekha jaae to congress dilli main alji ko saport karnaa bijepi ko saport karnaa he
 He also spoke on the cooperation and dissent of the bureaucrats
 
 
 ashutosh kehete hai ki dilli main bijepi kii ore se jaanboojhkar naukarshahon ko massej diya ja rahaa he ki AAP sarkaar ke saath koordinate na kiya jaae
 They say that it depends on the elected government of the people how they run the government
 unke kahe anusaar bijepi ne dilli main aisi sthiti paidaa kar di he ki pradesh ke naukarshah kaam karne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 In such a situation, they have to find some way to increase the work
 ve aage kehete hai ki dilli sarkaar main hone vaala kaam, naukarshahi ke saath sambandh or adhikariyon se liya jane vaala kaam sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main aata he
 The party does not want to comment on it
 haalanki ve kendra sarkaar dwaara dilli ke naukarshahon kii dhamkee ko band karne kii baat kehete hai
 They say in the same order that the bureaucrats want to work with the Delhi government but they too have their career
 ve ant main apatkaal kaa zikr karte hai
 They say that every opposition party is being targeted these days
 police, inakam tex, ai
 b and CBI are being used to harm the opposition parties

 pakistan kii jail main bhartiya naagarik sarbajit singh par hamale ke mukhya aropiyon ne jaanch adhikariyon ko bataaya ki unhone lahore main pehle hue visphoton kaa badla lene ke liye sarbajit ko jaan se maarane kii yojana banaai thi
 According to preliminary reports prepared by Deputy Inspector General of Police (prison) Malik Mubashir, both the attackers Aamir Aftab and Mudassar have said that they hated Sarabjit, as he is accused of the 1990 bomb blasts in Lahore
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki malik ne punjab ke grih vibhaag ko report saunp di he
 The two attackers said that to kill 49-year-old Sarabjit, they used pointed spoons as knives and made blades of tin pieces of ghee
 unhone eent bhi jamaa kii thi
 According to the report, as soon as these people got a chance, they executed their plan
 kot lakhapat jail main beete shuukravaar ko hue hamale ke baad se sarbajit jinna aspataal ke isiu main ventilator par he
 Aftab and Mudassar could not give satisfactory answers to the question as to why they started hating Sarabjit in recent times and conspired to assassinate him, while he has been in Kot Lakhpat Jail for the past several years
 mudassar saal 2005 or aftab 2009 se lahore kii is jail main band he
 He did not respond when asked if anyone had instigated Sarabjit to kill him
 unhone isse inkaar ki ve kisi dharmik athwa charampanthi sanghathan se jude hue hai
 Sources say the investigating officers are not ruling out this possibility
 karagaar vibhaag ke ek sutara ne bataaya, ‘aisa lagata he ki donon aropiyon ko bataaya gaya tha ki ve apane aparaadh ke makasad ko lekar gadhi gai kahani ko hi doharaaen
 "this source said," It is easy to create sympathy for this heinous crime by saying that they did this to avenge the Lahore blasts
 ’ sutron kaa kahana he ki prashasan nyaayik ayog kii jaanch tak maamle ko aage badhaane kaa puraa prayaas karegaa
 Investigations by DIG Malik also stated that there was a security flaw from the jail administration
 do jail warden ahasanul haq ore mohammad safadar ne jaanch adhikariyon ko bataaya ki unhone sarbajit ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya or isi chakkar main unhen maamuli chotein ai hai
 In another development, the Lahore police has been allowed to interrogate Aftab and Mudassar by the local magistrate
 supreme court ne rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar gujarat congress kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The court asked the petitioner Vivek Tankha, advocate of Gujarat Pradesh Congress, to petition the Election Commission
 chunaav prakriya khatm hone ke baad hi ham chunaav yachika ke rup main sunwaayee karenge, lekin abhi nahin
 The Supreme Court held that simultaneous elections are held to fill a regular vacancy, but there is no compulsion to hold simultaneous elections for casual vacancies
 ab adaalaton ke kai adeshon or faislon se ek teesri shrenee statutary kii saamne aa gai he
 You should file its petition before the Commission
 ab donon siten jeet sakati he bijepecourt ke faisle ke baad ab bijepi donon siten jeetne main kaamyaab ho sakati he
 The candidate needs 61 votes to win the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat by number strength
 chunaav ayog ke notification ke mutabik, vidhayak alag-alag vot karenge
 In such a situation, they will get a chance to vote twice
 is tarah bijepi vidhayak jinaki sankhya 100 se zyada he ve do baar vot karke donon ummidavaaron ko jitwa sakate hai
 What is the whole matter? Actually, Rajya Sabha seats are vacant after Union Home Minister Amit Shah was elected as a Lok Sabha member from Gandhinagar and Union Minister Smriti Irani from Amethi
 congress vidhayak or gujarat vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh pareshabhai dhanani ne supreme court main yachika daayar kar chunaav ayog se donon siton par saath-saath chunaav karaane kaa nirdesh dene kaa anurodh kiya gaya
 The Congress said the ec's decision was unconstitutional, the petition filed by the Congress leader said that holding separate elections on both the seats on the same day is unconstitutional and against the spirit of the Constitution
 gujarat se rajyasabha main khaali hui do siton par chunaav ayog ne 5 july ko chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 If elections are held on a ballot, Congress will come to the account of one seat
 There are 100 BJP mlas and 75 Congress mlas in Gujarat Assembly
 jabaki saat siten maujuuda samay main rikt hai
 In such a situation, both the vacant Rajya Sabha seats were held simultaneously and if the mlas voted only in one go, both BJP and Congress can win one seat each
 isiilie congress donon siton par ek saath chunaav karaane ke paksh main he
 An election on the same ballot will allow the candidate to cast a single vote, in which case the Congress will easily take out a seat as it alone has 71 mlas

 ASI Sohan Lal, a resident of Sikar district in Rajasthan, later died
 ghatana ke baad seemaa kii suraksha main lagi tukadiyon ne javaabi karrwai kii

 An advance border post at Samba was his target

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today announced the 'gold Monetization Scheme', with emphasis on making gold a 'lively power' from 'dead money'
 jiske tahat bainkon main sona rakhane waalon ko byaaj ke rup main aarthik laabh milegaa
 In his address on the program 'mann Ki Baat' aired on AIR, the Prime Minister said, 'one can reduce the love for gold
 lekin, sone ko ‘ded mani’ ke rup main rakhana yah aaj ke yug main shobhaa nahin detaa he
 'he said that in the last budget we had announced an important plan
 hamaare desh main sona ek prakaar se saamaajik jivan kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 Gold has been considered as a medium of economic security
 sankat samay kii chaabi gold mana gaya he
 It is now a tradition in society and life for centuries
 modi ne kaha, ‘sona aarthik shakti or desh kii aarthik sampatti ban saktaa he
 Every Indian should contribute to this
 aaj mujhe khushi he ki bajet main jo hamane vaayada kiya tha, is diwaali ke tyohaar main or jabaki dhanteras or log us din khasaroop se sona kharidte hai, to, uske purv hi ham mahatvapurn yojanaon ko launch karne ja rahe hai
 We have introduced the 'gold Monetization Scheme'
 iske antargat aap apana gold bank main jamaa kar sakate hai or bank us par aapako byaaj degi jaise ki aap apane paise jamaa karte hai or byaaj miltaa he
 Modi said that earlier gold was kept in a locker and you had to pay the rent of the locker
 ab gold bank main rakhenge or bank aapako byaaj degaa
 Now gold can become a property
 unhone kaha, ‘sona ded mani se ek jeevant takat ke rup main parivartit ho saktaa he, ab ghar main gold mat rakhie
 His security and his interest are two or two benefits, definitely take advantage of it
 ’pradhanmantri ne kaha ki duusari baat ‘savrain gold band’ he jisamen aap ke haath main ek kaagaj aata he, lekin us kaagaj kaa mulya utana hi he, jitna ki sone kaa he
 And the day you return that paper, on that day the value of gold, the more money will be given back to you
 unhone kaha ki maan lijie aaj aapane 1000 rupee ke sone ke daam ke hisaab se svarnim band liya or paanch saal ke baad aap band vaapis karne gaye or us samay sone kaa daam dhai hajaar rupee he
 So in exchange for that paper you will get two and a half thousand rupees
 unhone kaha ki iskaa ham prarambh kar rahe hai
 Due to this, we will no longer need to buy gold, no need to handle gold
 sona kahaan rakhen uski chintaa hat jaaegi, or kaagaj chori karne koi aayega bhi nahin
 Modi said that i will definitely put this scheme guaranteed by the countrymen in the coming weeks
 mujhe yah bataate hue khushi ho rahi he ki ham sone ke sikke bhi laa rahe hai
 Independence has been around for 70 years, but till now we have been using foreign coins only
 hamaare desh kaa swadeshi mark kyon nahin hona chahie or isiilie aane vaale vaale hafte main or dhanteras ke purv yah saamaanya nagarikon ko uplabdh ho jayega
 He said that an Indian gold coin of five grams and ten grams of Ashoka Chakra is being introduced
 iske saath hi bees gram kii sone kii ginni bhi logon ke liye uplabdh hogi
 i am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and i will get your support
