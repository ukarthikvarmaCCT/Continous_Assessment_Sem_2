 Prabhudeva, the director of the upcoming film Action Jackson, has received a legal notice from Hollywood studio Warner Bros
 regarding the title of the film
 iske baavjood vah or film nirmaataa gordhan tanwani is sheershak se peeche hatane ke mood main nahin hai
 Actually, the title 'action Jackson' is copyrighted by Warner Bros
 warner bros kii 1988 kii hollywood film isi sheershak ke saath pradarshit hui thi
 The film stars Karl Weathers and Sharon Stone
 production house ne 'ection jackson' sheershak upmahadweep main pehle se panjikrut hone ke chalate ab bollywood ko apni film kaa naam badalane ke liye notice bhijwaya he
 a letter has been sent to Baba Arts Limited Production and Eros International regarding this
 donon milakar yah film bana rahe hai
 On the other hand, Prabhudeva says that there is a very specific reason behind the title of the film 'action Jackson'
 nirdeshak ne kaha, hamane film kaa naam 'ection jackson' rakhaa, kyonki hamaare nayak ajay devgan 'age' ke rup main jane jate hai
 We thought it would be a good idea to use the initials and expand them into the title as 'action Jackson', as Ajay is doing both dance and action in the film
 prabhudeva ko isse purv apni film 'rambo rajkumaar' kaa naam 'aar
 
 rajkumaar' karnaa padaa tha
 He cannot do that in every title
 jahaan tak sheershak kaa hollywood film se taalluk he to prabhudeva ne apane sheershak kaa paksh liya
 He said, i never heard of a Hollywood movie titled 'action Jackson'
 kya yah 25 saal pehle nahin ai? 'romeo and juuliyat' sheershak se kai filmein hai to kya shakespeare ke parivaar ko mukadmaa kar dena chahie? Know what was special in the world of film and TV on Friday through film wrap

 uski england main 2019 main hone vaale isisi vishwa cap main sidhe kwalification kii ummiido ko is haar se tagada jhatka laga he
 Sri Lanka had to win at least two matches in the five-match ODI series played against India to qualify directly in the World Cup, but failed to do so and are 0-4 behind

 However, Sri Lanka's hopes of qualifying directly have not completely ended, according to the ICC statement, after trailing 0-4 to India, Sri Lanka will now have to depend on at least one defeat in the upcoming series of the West Indies, if If this happens, Sri Lanka can get a direct entry to the World Cup
 behad bure daur main shrinlakshgar srilanka ravivaar ko bharat ke khilaaf hone vaale aakhri match main jeet hasil kar letaa he to uske 88 ank ho jaaenge, haalanki yah kwalification ke liye paryaapt nahin honge
 The Windies have a chance to overtake Sri Lanka
 agar vah aane vaale apane chah maichon main jeet hasil kar leti he to vah bhi 88 ankon par pahunch jaaegi
 In such a situation, it will be able to take an edge over Sri Lanka on the basis of decimal points

 The state government has decided to introduce the Rajasthan Heritage Protection Bill 2015 in the Assembly, which is facing heavy opposition from the former royal families and Thakurs
 yah vidheyak mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke dimag kii upaj he, jo khud dhaulpur kii maharani or gwalior kii rajkumaari rah chuki hai
 The Bill proposes to set up an Heritage Authority and a Heritage Council under it, which have been given tremendous powers
 inamen kisi bhi dharohar sampatti kaa uske rakh-rakhaav ke liye adhigrahan karnaa bhi shaamil he
 The biggest shock to the people affected by the Bill is that the Bill empowers the Authority to acquire any property immediately
 apwaad ke taur par vidheyak main do maheene ke notice kaa praavdhaan bhi he
 The bill allows for any fixed work within the memorial to be filed — all they have to do is give 24 hours notice
 rajasthan main aisi hajaaron nijee sampattiyaan hai or hitdharakon ko sabase zyada chintaa is baat kii he ki vidheyak aisi jarjar padi sampattiyon tathaa achche rakh-rakhaav vaali sampattiyon main koi fark nahin karata, jiskaa nihit swaarthon vaale netaa or partiyaan sambhawatah durupyog kar sakate hai
 "we believe that some properties need maintenance," says Randhir Vikram Singh, general secretary of the Indian Heritage Hotels Association
 magar vidheyak aisi sampattiyon main koi fark nahin karata, jinaki acchhee tarah se dekhbhaal kii ja rahi he or jinhen sarkaar ke dakhal kii jarurat he
 The disputed bill was tabled in the state assembly on April 9 and sent to the Select Committee without any debate
 rajasthan ke shahari vikaas or awaas mantri raajapaal singh shekhavat samiti ke adhyaksh hai or isamen bharatpur ke purv maharaj tathaa congress vidhayak vishvendra singh or jaipur kii purv rajkumaari tathaa bijepi kii vidhayak diya kumari sareekhe sadsy bhi shaamil hai
 On 1 September, the committee held a meeting with stakeholders affected by the bill, including Arvind Singh Mewar of Udaipur, Gaj Singh of Jodhpur and Randhir Vikram Singh of Mandawa, belonging to former royal houses
 baithak main vishvendra singh ne kaha, ''yah ek behad krur kanoon banaaya ja rahaa he
 "the general consensus was that the bill should be either completely abandoned or completely amended by significant amendments
" purv shahi gharaanon ne purajor virodh ke baad sarkaar ko apane faisle par dobaaraa sochane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The government is now in a dilemma as to whether to table it in the House in the Assembly session that begins on 16 September
 khud shahi prishthbhumi se aane ke naate raaje dharohar sampattiyon ke sangrakshan or vikaas main behad dilchaspee leti hai
 In his last tenure ended in 2008, he started a pilot project to transform the fort of Amer, making it more suited to tourists and opening many parts of the fort, which were previously out of reach of the audience
 
 unhone ek vidheyak bhi pesh kiya tha, jiske tahat nijee kshetra ko rajya kii milkiyat vaale smarakon ko god lene kii ijaajat mil gai hoti, lekin sarkaar ke bheetar se hi is vidheyak kii mukhaalafat hui or aakhirkaar ise chhodia padaa
 In contrast, the current heritage bill has excluded all properties owned by the state from its purview and included only private properties, leaving the owners of such properties fearful that their ownership of the land and building May be in danger
 jahiraa taur par yah vidheyak raaje sarkaar sahit pichhali sarkaron kii un tamaam koshishon ke ulat he, jinamein unhone smarakon se alag apni dharohar sampattiyon ko yaa to lij par dekar yaa public-privet partnership ke jariye nijee kshetra ke haathon main saunpane kii koshish kii thi
 Most such attempts failed because investors were expected to pay huge sums of money to the government
 purv shahi gharaane yah maang kar rahe hai ki jarjar sampattiyon ko unke pehle vaale maalikon ko yaa heritage hotel chalaane waalon ko saunp diya jaae
 That is why this bill in its present form has raised serious questions on the government's intention — the government's real objective is to really protect the heritage buildings or it is targeting some former royal houses by using this bill as a tool
 In order to acquire their assets and hand them over to the corporate world, including some former royal houses
 isse prabhavit hone vaale shikaayat kar rahe hai ki yah vidheyak nijee dharohar sampattiyon ke maalikon kii madad karne main sarkaar kii bhoomika saaf karne kii bajaae viniamak or adhigrahan kii vyavastha par zyada jor detaa he, jiske liye pehle se hi kai kanoon maujuud hai
 There are legal problems with this as well
 arvind singh mewar bataate hai, ''in sampattiyon ke adhigrahan se jude dheron kanoonee pech saamne aaenge—kai peedhishon se in par malikana haq kaayam he or koi bhi aasaani se inkaa adhigrahan karne kii ijaajat nahin degaa
 Meanwhile, Diya Kumari has demanded that the contracted properties be kept out of the purview of the Bill
 heritage hotalon ke maalik bhi pareshaan hai
 Gaj Singh of Jodhpur, president of the Indian Heritage Hotels Association, says that heritage hotels are already contributing substantially to the tourism and economy of the state, they should be excluded from this bill
 vidheyak kaa praaroop taiyaar hone ke baad shahari vikaas mantri shekhavat ne sampattiyon ke maalikon se kaha he ki ve pareshaan na hon
 He has also promised that the government will revisit the bill with an open mind
 ve kehete hai, ''maalikon ne kabje ke hakon ko lekar chintaa jataai he; ham dekhenge ki vidheyak ko nae sire se taiyaar karen yaa uski dhaaraon ko badalen
 '' mumbai hamale ke sajeeshkarta or lashkar-e-taiyaba ke aatanki david colman hedli kii patni or uske kaarobaari saajhedaar ne ek nijee praavdhaan kaa hawala dete hue enie kii ore se puche gaye sawaalon kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya he
 The agency had contacted Headley's wife Shazia, who lives in Britain, and her business partner Raymond Sanders through the US Department of Justice to get answers to some questions related to the 55-year-old terrorist
 donon ne diya niztaa kaa hawalaadhikarik sutron ke mutabik, donon ne niztaa ke praavdhaan kaa hawala dete hue sawaalon ke jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 According to US law, neither of the two are accused in this case
 aise main ve kisi bhi videshi agency ke poochtacha ke aagrah ko sweekaar yaa asweekaar kar sakate hai
 The reason for contacting her was contacted by the investigating officers of India, as they feel that Headley hid the information about her family and did not even tell her family about her activities in India and her contact with Lashkar i knew dogier main bhi he zikranie ke 106 pannon ke dogier ke mutabik, hedli ne bhartiya jaanch adhikariyon se kaha tha ki uske parivaar ko lekar koi sawaal nahin poocha janaa chahie
 The dossier was produced after Headley was captured in the US in 2010
 dogier ke anusaar hedli ne kaha, 'maine 1999 main shajia gilaani se shaadi kii thi
 i do not want to discuss the details of my in-laws, as they have nothing to do with my activities
 ' apane parivaar, khaskar pehali patni ke bare main jaankaree chhipate hue hedli ne enie kii team se kaha tha, 'meraa aagrah hoga ki mujhase mere parivaar ke sadasyon se jude sawaalon ke bare main na poocha jaae
 "shajiashikago court records used to use code word," Shazia saw the Mumbai attack on TV and at that time she used the code word that "I am watching cartoons
" ' shajia ne hedli ko likhe email main kaha, 'main in cartoonon (hamalon) ko puure din dekh rahi hum or mujhe tum par garv he
 'he also said that he was proud of Headley's graduation (attack success)
 yah khulaasa hedli kii ore se 27 may 2011 ko pakistani mul ke aatankwaadi tahawwur rana ke khilaaf sunwaayee ke chauthe din kiya gaya tha
 Headley had told defense lawyer Patrick W
 Belgan that many people congratulated him and Shazia after the Mumbai attack
 shajia ko denmark hamale ke bare main bhi jaankaree thi
 Sanders also helped! Sanders owns the 'first World Immigration Service' in Chicago
 mana jaataa he ki usne hedli ko bharat ko vija dilaane or mumbai main avrajan centre kholane main madad kii
 Headley is serving a 35-year sentence in the US for plotting attacks in Mumbai and Denmark

 This has happened before, but such cases are negligible and this happens due to some problems in the battery
 karjamaafee ko lekar desh kaa kisaan aae din andolan ke liye sadak par utarane ko majaboor ho rahaa he
 In the same sequence, thousands of farmers walked from Haridwar in Uttarakhand to delhi-up border on Tuesday, when the police used sticks, tear gas and water splashes to prevent them from coming to Delhi
 sarkaar se baatcheet or puure din chale sangharsh ke baad aakhirkaar khun se lathpath saikadon kisaan der raat dilli main daakhil ho paae or choudhary charan singh kii samadhi par phool chadhaaya or andolan khatm karne kii ghoshnaa karke waapas laut gaye
 The resentment of the farmers who returned empty-handed from the Delhi Durbar remains the same
 unpar lathicharge ke khilaaf desh main kai jagah pradarshan ho rahe hai
 After all, why farmers are protesting till Delhi again and again
 karjamaafee unki samasya kaa mahaj ek paksh he
 Aaj Tak spoke to farmers to know and understand the ground reality of their problems
 kya chaahate hai kisaan?kisaan kranti yatra main bijanour se aae kisaan anis ahamed kehete hai ki sarkaar kisaanon kii fasal kii laagat kaa uchit mulya de or uskaa samay par bhugtan kar de to karjamaafee kii naubat hi na aae
 For the past 6 months, Anees Ahmed's sugarcane payment is due on the Dwarikesh sugar mill in Najibabad region
 anis ke mutabik unke jaise hi ilaake ke baaki kisaanon kaa bhugtan bhi nahin ho paaya he
 Anees says that he has a bank loan of 2 lakh 60 thousand, on which he is paying 12 percent interest
 ganna kaa bhugtan na hone ke chalate ve apana bank kaa karj adaa nahin kar paa rahe hai
 They say that we have to pay interest to the bank in the event of failure to repay the loan
 jabaki sugar mil par hamaara lakhon kaa bakaayaa he, lekin us par hamen koi byaaj yaa bonus nahin miltaa he
 This is the dual attitude of the government with the farmers
 laagat badi lekin aay nahindilli ke jatkhod gaanv ke rahane vaale kisaan kuldeep dahia kehete hai kimodi sarkaarne emspi do guna karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin fasal kii laagat main kitni badhotaree ho gai use nahin bataaya
 At present, the cost of farming has increased considerably, but according to that we are not getting the price
 wo kehete hai ki sarkaar jab fasal kii kharidari shuru karti he, tab tak kisaan sahukaaron ke haathon bech chuke hote hai
 Why not a separate budget for agriculture? Anand Rana, a resident of Qutubgarh village in Bawana area of delhi, says that farmers are out of the agenda of political parties, that is why nobody is talking about them today
 sarkaar bajet banane se pehle audyogic gharaanon or corporate jagat ke logon se baatcheet to karti he, lekin kabhi kisaanon ke pratinidhiyon kii raay nahin leti
 Whereas 70 percent of the people of this country depend on farming
 rana kehete hai ki kisaan apni fasal main jitna lagaataa he ki uskaa aadha bhi nahin nikalataa he
 This is the reason the farmer is in debt today
 bank se zyada kisaanon par sahukaaron kaa karj he
 Abdus Salam, a resident of Dikka Kala village in Saharanpur, is a tenor of 80 bighas
 kheti se hi unke parivaar kaa kharch chalata he
 They say that sugar mills owe their cane payment of Rs 2
5 lakh
 farvari se abhi tak koi bhugtan nahin kii gai he
 In such a situation it is difficult to drive home
 pichley dinon karj lekar apane bete kaa ilaaj karaayaa hum
 How do farmers raise families? They say that inflation is increasing day and night, but our crop is selling at the same old price
 jabaki aaj kheti ke liye diapi se lekar uria or beej mahange mil rahe hai
 The cost incurred in farming is not being able to come out
 jabaki hamaara puraa parivaar kheti main laga hua he
 Gulzar Qureshi, who hails from Saharanpur Ambetha, says that the Modi government had promised not to impose GST on goods related to farmers
 lekin aaj tractor par hamen 28 fisadi jiesti deni pad rahi he
 Apart from this, the state government is taking 29 thousand rupees annually from us on electricity connection of tubewells
 jabaki tubel kaa istemaal ham mahaj do maheene se kam karte hai
 Despite this, the government has to pay electricity bills throughout the year
 engiti ke aadesh se badi mushkildilli ke mungeshpur gaanv ke rahane vaale dalel singh kehete hai ki engiti ne das saal puraane tractor par ensiaar main pratibandh laga diya he
 By farming, we are already in debt, how will we buy a new tractor every ten years
 iske alaava bank se karj lekar tractor kharidte hai to 12 fisadi byaaj dene pad rahaa he
 Electricity bills are also being generated Vinod Sherawat, a resident of Dikkatdariyapur Kala village, says that there is no alternative system for irrigation in Delhi
 kheti ke liye tubel kaa hi sahaara he
 Tubel is used for only four months for irrigation of wheat cultivation in Delhi
 baaki samay hamaara tubel band rahata he
 Before April this year, we had to pay Rs 25 per fortnight
 is lihaaj main hamaara bill 125 rupee aata tha
 But the power companies have now increased it to 125 rupees per kwh, in this sense, about 625 rupees bill comes and about 700 rupees per month has to be paid including tax
 jabaki kheti se saal main kareeb 10 hajaar kii bajat hoti thi ab wo bhi nahin ho paa rahi he

 When the Indian team will play their second one-day match on Tuesday at the Rose Bowl ground after Tendulkar was ruled out of the series due to a foot injury, he would find the journey ahead even more difficult as the team, frustrated by the injury to several key players, was forced to play Tendulkar

 On Monday, in a statement by the Foreign Ministry, it was said that the forces of the two countries would gradually withdraw from Doklam

 The Chinese Army welcomed the decision, but also gave India advice
 chini sena ke senior karnal vu shiyaan ne kaha ki ham is maamle ke sulajhane se khush hai, lekin bharat ko is mudde se sabak lenaa chahie
 He said that China would still remain vigilant over the matter and protect its sovereignty

 On behalf of the neighboring country, it was said that India withdrew its jawans
 haalanki china ilaake main sadak banane kii apni yojana par chup rahaa
 Due to his plan to build a road, a situation of deadlock between the armies of the two countries was created in Doklam area near Sikkim
 china ne kaha ki vah jamini sthiti ke saath saamanjasy sthapit karegaa

 unhone is baat par jor diya ki bharat ne apane javaanon ko waapas bula liya he

 jab swadeshi jaagran manch bhartiya rigerv bank ko salaah dene lage ki use kya karnaa he to iskaa matlab yahi he ki bharat main ej of duing vaaki acha ho gaya he
 At the time of demonetisation, which took a long time to count the notes, the Reserve Bank wrote two four lines on demonetisation in the general report, then no one thought that Urjit Patel should resign
 balki tab rigerv bank ko bhi nahin laga ki sarkaar hastkshep kar rahi he
 His autonomy is under attack
 sabko urjit patel arjeet patel lag rahe the
 Now Urjit Patel's resignation is also being sought and there is news of his resignation as well
 sarkaar or bhartiya reserve bank ke bich santulan hona chahie, magar yah santulan abhi kyon dolata nazar aa rahaa he
 Why Swadeshi Jagran also feels that Governor Urjit Patel should stop his officers from publicly exposing the differences or leave the post

 gurumurti rigerv bank ke anshkalik nideshak hai
 He was present at the board meeting
 isamen 5 muddon kii charchaa hui or chaar par sahmati bani
 But there was no pressure on just one issue
 is sandarbh main swadeshi jaagran manch kaa urjit patel ko salaah or istife kii baat mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 Did the Swadeshi Jagran Manch say anything when Raghuram Rajan gave the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry a list of some key defaulters that they should be investigated, they are making a mess in repaying the loan
 hamen nahin pataa ki ise lekar swadeshi jaagran manch or rigerv bank main es gurumurti ne kya kiya he yaa kya karne ja rahe hai
 But Dheeraj Mishra of The Wire reports that the Reserve Bank has confirmed the information under the RTI that Rajan had sent his letter to the Prime Minister's Office on 4 February 2015
 is patr main un baqaayadaaron kii suchi thi, jinke khilaaf rajan jaanch chaahate the
 On 6 September, Rajan submitted a 17-page note to the Committee of Parliament
 bataaya tha ki bharat ke bainkon main non parfarming asset kii samasya kyon he or kitni badi he
 Now the Prime Minister's Office should tell what action was taken on that list
 di vir ne yahi jawaab pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha tha ki rajan kaa patr soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat nahin aata he
 Don't you find it strange that the same question was asked from the Prime Minister's Office and the same question was asked from the Reserve Bank of India but the Reserve Bank responded and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond
 kya sab kuch thik he, bilkul thik he
 Only then one did not answer, even then the other got an answer
 taaliyaan

 Ira Dugganal of the Bloomberg website wrote that Governor Urjit Patel and two of his two deputies had spoken in public on March 26, April and October 12, before Deputy Governor Viral Acharya burst on 26 October
 jisase saaf-saaf ishaara miltaa he ki rigerv bank apni swytta ke liye sangharsh kar rahaa he
 In his report of 28 Akbutar, Ira Duggal has told that when the Punjab National Bank scam came to light, Finance Minister Jaitley had said without naming how such a big scam missed the eyes of the auditor and regulator
 iskaa bada hi kadaa jawaab governor urjit patel ne gujarat lau uniwarsity ke apane bhaashan main diya tha
 He said that the Reserve Bank needed more powers to control public sector banks
 uske adhikaar bahut simit he
 Urjit Patel had said that the Reserve Bank cannot remove the director, change the management, force the merger
 bhartiya reserve bank jahaan sabhi bainkon kaa niyaman karata he, sarkari bainkon kaa niyaman sarkaar karti he, kyonki vahi in bainkon kii badi hissedaar he
 In this way banks have double control
 ek tarah se urjit patel ne punjab neshnal bank ghotaale kii zimmedaari sarkaar ke paale main daal di thi, jabaki sarkaar rigerv bank par dosha daalana chaahati thi
 On February 12, a circular was issued that if banks were to delay the repayment of loan from big borrowers by a day, then note it and start the process of declaring bankruptcy
 is nae circular se bade power plant ke diwalia hone kaa khatra bad gaya
 The bankers went to the government and the government to the RBI
 magar arabiai ne apane rukh main badlaav nahin kiya
 RBI defended this circular in public in the months of July and August
 baad main banker court chale gaye or vahaan se 12 sitambar ko raahat mil gai
 In the court, the RBI said that if the government wanted a change in the circular, it could have told the RBI
 iske pehle april main pune ke neshnal institute of banking main bolte hue dipti governor enes vishvanathan ke bayaan ko hindu bijness line or iconomik times ne report kiya tha
 The head of which is that the Reserve Bank has shown its strength, hopefully it will remain the same
 dipti governor vishvanathan ne kaha tha ki bainkon ke lone kaa sahi moolyankan bainkon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or sarkaar ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or lone lekar nahin chukaane waalon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he
 Banks make their bookkeeping neat and avoid getting tagged with defaulters defaulters
 yaad kiijie yahi baat vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki rigerv bank ne enpie kaa sahi moolyankan nahin kiya, jabaki dipti governor kah chuke hai ki yah kaam to bank or sarkaar kaa tha jo unhone nahin kaha
 Vishwanathan had clearly stated that banks are not ready to change
 13 aktubar ke times of india main dipti governor viral acharya ne iaiti bambe main kaha ki bainkon par ankush lagane se bure lone par asar padaa he or bainkon kii haalat bigadane se bachi he
 Therefore, it is very important to continue this
 reserve bank ne 11 aise bainkon par pisie yani 'pramt karactive ection' laga diya tha, jinke lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ho gaya tha
 Viral Acharya gave this speech on 12 October
 tippaniyan There has been pressure from the government to curb this from banks and allow them to give more loans
 to aapane dekha ki bhartiya reserve bank lagaataar janata ke bich apni swytta kii baat kar rahaa he, or adhik adhikaar die jane kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin sabakaa dhyaan tab gaya jab 26 aktubar ko dipti acharya ne public main bol diya ki kendriya bank kii swytta ko kamazor karnaa vinaashkari ho saktaa he
 Later the government had to issue a statement that rbi's autonomy is necessary and it is respected
 lekin rigerv bank ke adhikari public main baat na kahen
 The government now said, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank had been pointing to the public since the month of March that there was unnecessary pressure
 aakhir rigerv bank ke astitv main aane ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar ne kabhi section saat ke tahat aadesh nahin diya, magar ab yah naubat kyon ai he
 Under this section, the government can order the Reserve Bank what to do
 aakhir rigerv bank or sararkaar ke bich yah tanatani kyon hui, kyon sarkaar chaahati he ki bainkon ko karj dene kii chhot mili, jabaki karj kii vaapasi nahin hone ke kaaran bainkon kii haalat khasta he
 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 There should be a balance between the government and the Reserve Bank of India, but why this balance still seems to be swinging
 kyon swadeshi jaagran ko bhi lagata he ki governor urjit patel apane afasaron ko saarvajinak rup se matbhedon ko ujagar karne se roke yaa phir pad chhod den
 What would have happened if some other organization had commented on the CBI like this organization of national volunteer
 tab vah kise pad chhodane ke liye kahati
 Why Swadeshi Jagran has suddenly started awakening about the Reserve Bank, what Swadeshi has shown in the activities of the Reserve Bank, you should hear from Ashwani Mahajan
 swadeshi jaagran manch ke hi es gurumurti ko lekar vivaad kii khabar ai thi, jisase gurumurti ne inkaar kiya tha
 Gurumurthy is a part-time director of the Reserve Bank
 unhone kaha ki board kii baithak main maujuud the
 It discussed 5 issues and agreed on four
 sirf ek mudde ko lekar lekin koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya
 In this context, the talk of Swadeshi Jagran Manch to Urjit Patel and resignation becomes important
 kya swadeshi jaagran manch ne tab kuch kaha tha, jab raghuram rajan ne pradhanmantri karyaalay or vitt mantralay ko kuch pramukh baqaayadaaron kii suchi di thi ki inaki jaanch ho, ye lone chukaane main gadabadi kar rahe hai
 We do not know what s Gurumurthy has done or is going to do about the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the Reserve Bank
 lekin di vir ke dhiraj mishra kii report he ki reserve bank ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat is jaankaree kii pushti kii he ki rajan ne apana patr 4 farvari 2015 ko pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhej diya tha
 The letter contained a list of the defaulters against whom Rajan wanted to investigate
 6 sitambar ko rajan ne 17 pannon kaa ek note sansad kii samiti ko saunpa tha
 Had told why the banks of India have a problem with non-performing assets and how big it is
 ab pradhanmantri karyaalay hi bataae ki us list ko lekar kya karrwai hui
 The Wire had asked the Prime Minister's Office that Rajan's letter does not come under the RTI
 kya aapako yahi ajeeb nahin lagata ki ek hi sawaal pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha gaya or vahi sawaal bhartiya reserve bank se poocha gaya magar reserve bank ne jawaab diya or pradhanmantri karyaalay ne jawaab hi nahin diya
 Is everything okay, all right
 tabhi to ek ne jawaab nahin diya tab bhi duusare se jawaab mil gaya

 agrezi media main sarkaar or reserve bank ko lekar kaaphi kuch likhaa ja rahaa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley had said that elected leaders are accountable and not regulators

 Will the public punish them for this? kehane kaa matlab he ki yah sab mudda hi kab hota he
 Sunil Jain also wrote that during the ten years of UPA 1 and 2, the share value of all psus decreased by 6 lakh crores, but within five years of the Modi government, there was a loss of 11 lakh crores
 aapane kab suna he ki janata kaa paisa nasht karne ke liye log sarkaar ko doshi tehra rahe hon
 Therefore, elected representatives cannot have any special intervention in this matter

 Mihir Sharma has written on com that the Reserve Bank gives 50 to 60 thousand crores to the government every year from its profits

 bloomberg website kii ira duggnal ne likhaa he ki 26 aktubar ko dipti governor viral acharya ke fat padane se pehle march, april or 12 aktubar ko governor urjit patel or unke do do dipti public main bol chuke hai
 Which gives a clear indication that the Reserve Bank is fighting for its autonomy
 28 akbutar ke apni report main ira duggal ne bataaya he ki jab punjab neshnal bank kaa ghotaalaa saamne aayaa, tab vitt mantri jetali ne bina naam liye kaha tha ki itnaa bada ghotaalaa auditor or regulator kii nazar se kaise chook gaya
 Governor Urjit Patel gave a very strong answer to this in his speech of Gujarat Law University
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkari bainkon par niyantran ke liye reserve bank ko or adhikaar chahie
 His authority is very limited
 urjit patel ne kaha tha ki reserve bank nideshak ko nahin hataa saktaa he, prabandhan ko nahin badal saktaa he, vilay ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa he
 While the Reserve Bank of India regulates all banks, government banks are regulated by the government, as they are the major shareholders of these banks
 is tarah se bainkon par doharaa niyantran he
 In a way, Urjit Patel had put the responsibility of the Punjab National Bank scam in the government's court, while the government wanted to blame the Reserve Bank
 12 farvari ko ek circular jari hua ki bank agar bade karzdaaron se lone kii vaapasi main ek din kii bhi deree ho to use note karen or diwalia ghoshit karne kii prakriya shuru kar den
 This new circular increased the risk of bankruptcy of large power plants
 bank vaale sarkaar ke paas gaye or sarkaar arabiai ke paas
 But the RBI did not change its stand
 arabiai ne july or agast ke maheene main public main apane is circular kaa bachaav kiya
 The bankers later moved to court and from there on 12 September got relief
 court main arabiai ne kaha ki agar sarkaar circular main badlaav chaahati thi to vah arabiai se kah sakati thi
 Earlier in April, while speaking at Pune's National Institute of Banking, Deputy Governor NS Vishwanathan's statement was reported by Hindu Business Line and Economic Times
 jisaki heading he ki rigerv bank ne apana dam dikhaaya, ummid he dam barkaar rahegaa
 Deputy Governor Vishwanathan had said that the correct valuation of banks' loans is also suits the banks and suits the government as well as those who do not repay the loans
 bank apana bahikhaata saaf suthra kar lete hai or bakaayedaar difolter kaa tag lagane se batch jate hai
 Recall that this is what the Finance Minister is saying that the Reserve Bank did not evaluate the NPA correctly, while the Deputy Governor has said that the work was done by the bank and the government, which he did not say
 vishvanathan ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki bank badalane ke liye taiyaar nahin ho rahe hai
 In the Times of India on October 13, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya said at IIT Bombay that curbing banks had affected bad loans and saved banks from deteriorating
 isliye iskaa jari rahanaa bahut zaruri he
 The Reserve Bank had imposed PCA i
e
 'prompt Corrective Action' on 11 such banks, which had a large portion of their loans becoming npas
 viral acharya ne yah bhaashan 12 aktubar ko diya tha
 The comments sarkaar kaa dabaav rahaa he ki bainkon se yah ankush lage or unhen or adhik lone dene kii chhot mili
 So you saw that the Reserve Bank of India is constantly talking about its autonomy among the public, and is talking about giving more powers, but everyone got noticed when on October 26, Deputy Acharya spoke in public that the central bank Weakening autonomy can be disastrous
 baad main sarkaar ko bayaan jari karnaa padaa ki arabiai kii swytta jaruri he or vah sammaan karti he
 But Reserve Bank officials should not speak in public
 sarkaar ne ab kaha, jabaki march ke maheene se rigerv bank ke governor public ko ishaara kar rahe the ki anaavashyak dabaav pad rahaa he
 After all, the government has never given orders under section seven since the Reserve Bank came into existence, but why has it come to light now
 is section ke tahat sarkaar rigerv bank ko aadesh de sakati he ki kya karnaa he
 After all, why did this conflict between the Reserve Bank and the government, why the government wants banks to be given lending, while the condition of the banks is poor due to non-repayment of loans
 kya sarkaar kinhi khaas corporate gharaanon ke liye yah sab chaahati he, pataa nahin, kya sarkaar vaaki chaahati he ki bazaar main karz kii raashi uplabdh ho, to phir vah kyon nahin chaahati ki pehle 10 lakh karod ke enpie waapas hon
 There is also a question whether there is no money to lend in the market
 swadeshi jaagran reserve bank ko lekar achaanak kyon jaagran karne laga he, use reserve bank kii gatividhiyon main kya swadeshi dikhaa he, aap ashvini mahajan se hi sunen
 There was news of a dispute about s Gurumurthy from the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which Gurumurthy denied
 gurumurti rigerv bank ke anshkalik nideshak hai
 He was present at the board meeting
 isamen 5 muddon kii charchaa hui or chaar par sahmati bani
 But there was no pressure on just one issue
 is sandarbh main swadeshi jaagran manch kaa urjit patel ko salaah or istife kii baat mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 Did the Swadeshi Jagran Manch say anything when Raghuram Rajan gave the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry a list of some key defaulters that they should be investigated, they are making a mess in repaying the loan
 hamen nahin pataa ki ise lekar swadeshi jaagran manch or rigerv bank main es gurumurti ne kya kiya he yaa kya karne ja rahe hai
 But Dheeraj Mishra of The Wire reports that the Reserve Bank has confirmed the information under the RTI that Rajan had sent his letter to the Prime Minister's Office on 4 February 2015
 is patr main un baqaayadaaron kii suchi thi, jinke khilaaf rajan jaanch chaahate the
 On 6 September, Rajan submitted a 17-page note to the Committee of Parliament
 bataaya tha ki bharat ke bainkon main non parfarming asset kii samasya kyon he or kitni badi he
 Now the Prime Minister's Office should tell what action was taken on that list
 di vir ne yahi jawaab pradhanmantri karyaalay se poocha tha ki rajan kaa patr soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat nahin aata he
 Don't you find it strange that the same question was asked from the Prime Minister's Office and the same question was asked from the Reserve Bank of India but the Reserve Bank responded and the Prime Minister's Office did not respond
 kya sab kuch thik he, bilkul thik he
 Only then one did not answer, even then the other got an answer

 His authority is very limited
 urjit patel ne kaha tha ki reserve bank nideshak ko nahin hataa saktaa he, prabandhan ko nahin badal saktaa he, vilay ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa he
 While the Reserve Bank of India regulates all banks, government banks are regulated by the government, as they are the major shareholders of these banks

 In a way, Urjit Patel had put the responsibility of the Punjab National Bank scam in the government's court, while the government wanted to blame the Reserve Bank

 Recall that this is what the Finance Minister is saying that the Reserve Bank did not evaluate the NPA correctly, while the Deputy Governor has said that the work was done by the bank and the government, which he did not say

 After all, why did this conflict between the Reserve Bank and the government, why the government wants banks to be given lending, while the condition of the banks is poor due to non-repayment of loans
 kya sarkaar kinhi khaas corporate gharaanon ke liye yah sab chaahati he, pataa nahin, kya sarkaar vaaki chaahati he ki bazaar main karz kii raashi uplabdh ho, to phir vah kyon nahin chaahati ki pehle 10 lakh karod ke enpie waapas hon
 There is also a question whether there is no money to lend in the market
 agrezi media main sarkaar or reserve bank ko lekar kaaphi kuch likhaa ja rahaa he
 Finance Minister Jaitley had said that elected leaders are accountable and not regulators
 is par financial express ke sunil jain ne likhaa he or sawaal kiya he ki jab se modi sarkaar satta main ai he, saarvajanik kshetra kii companiyon ke sheyaron ke daam kaaphi gire hai
 Will the public punish them for this? kehane kaa matlab he ki yah sab mudda hi kab hota he
 Sunil Jain also wrote that during the ten years of UPA 1 and 2, the share value of all psus decreased by 6 lakh crores, but within five years of the Modi government, there was a loss of 11 lakh crores
 aapane kab suna he ki janata kaa paisa nasht karne ke liye log sarkaar ko doshi tehra rahe hon
 Therefore, elected representatives cannot have any special intervention in this matter

 iske pehle april main pune ke neshnal institute of banking main bolte hue dipti governor enes vishvanathan ke bayaan ko hindu bijness line or iconomik times ne report kiya tha
 The head of which is that the Reserve Bank has shown its strength, hopefully it will remain the same
 dipti governor vishvanathan ne kaha tha ki bainkon ke lone kaa sahi moolyankan bainkon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or sarkaar ko bhi suut kar rahaa he or lone lekar nahin chukaane waalon ko bhi suut kar rahaa he
 Banks make their bookkeeping neat and avoid getting tagged with defaulters defaulters
 yaad kiijie yahi baat vitt mantri kah rahe hai ki rigerv bank ne enpie kaa sahi moolyankan nahin kiya, jabaki dipti governor kah chuke hai ki yah kaam to bank or sarkaar kaa tha jo unhone nahin kaha
 Vishwanathan had clearly stated that banks are not ready to change
 13 aktubar ke times of india main dipti governor viral acharya ne iaiti bambe main kaha ki bainkon par ankush lagane se bure lone par asar padaa he or bainkon kii haalat bigadane se bachi he
 Therefore, it is very important to continue this
 reserve bank ne 11 aise bainkon par pisie yani 'pramt karactive ection' laga diya tha, jinke lone kaa bada hissaa enpie ho gaya tha
 Viral Acharya gave this speech on 12 October
 tippaniyan There has been pressure from the government to curb this from banks and allow them to give more loans
 to aapane dekha ki bhartiya reserve bank lagaataar janata ke bich apni swytta kii baat kar rahaa he, or adhik adhikaar die jane kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin sabakaa dhyaan tab gaya jab 26 aktubar ko dipti acharya ne public main bol diya ki kendriya bank kii swytta ko kamazor karnaa vinaashkari ho saktaa he
 Later the government had to issue a statement that rbi's autonomy is necessary and it is respected
 lekin rigerv bank ke adhikari public main baat na kahen
 The government now said, while the Governor of the Reserve Bank had been pointing to the public since the month of March that there was unnecessary pressure
 aakhir rigerv bank ke astitv main aane ke baad se aaj tak sarkaar ne kabhi section saat ke tahat aadesh nahin diya, magar ab yah naubat kyon ai he
 Under this section, the government can order the Reserve Bank what to do
 aakhir rigerv bank or sararkaar ke bich yah tanatani kyon hui, kyon sarkaar chaahati he ki bainkon ko karj dene kii chhot mili, jabaki karj kii vaapasi nahin hone ke kaaran bainkon kii haalat khasta he
 Does the government want all this for certain corporate houses, i do not know, does the government really want that the loan amount is available in the market, then why does it not want the npas of 10 lakh crores to be refunded first
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki kya bazaar main lone dene ke liye paise nahin hai
 Recall that this is what the Finance Minister is saying that the Reserve Bank did not evaluate the NPA correctly, while the Deputy Governor has said that the work was done by the bank and the government, which he did not say

 During this conversation, he said that i resigned only because the government is denying people their fundamental rights in democracy
 kashmir main sarkaar ne jo nirnay liya vah sahi he yaa galat wo vivaad kaa vishay ho saktaa he lekin sarkaar ke is nirnay par kashmir kii janata kaa pratikriya dene kaa adhikaar he
 But the government is not allowing them to do so
 main iske khilaaf hum
 Kannan said that this sensitivity is more about freedom of expression than Kashmir issue
 agar desh main kahin bhi kuch galat ho rahaa he, to us par logon ko pratikriya deni chahie
 The elected government has the right to take decisions but the public also has the right to react to it
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa faisla ek taraf lekin us par pratikriya dena moulik adhikaar he or uskaa sammaan hona chahie
 Regarding the question of leaving the job and protesting in this way, Kannan said that the expectations from the country's institutions, society, democracy and media were not fulfilled

 Ever since the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, there was a crisis in Bihar on the grand alliance

 Not only this, Pappu Yadav has also offered Manjhi to lead the Third Front
 iske alaava congress ko bhi saath laane kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 In fact, due to the stubbornness of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav in the Lok Sabha elections, Pappu Yadav and Kanhaiya Kumar could not enter the Grand Alliance against the BJP

 That is why the preparations for next year's assembly elections have already started and at the same time non-nda and non-rjd parties have started forming alliances

 Sreesanth, who is in jail in the IPL spot-fixing case, is such a bizarre person for whom it is not new to come in the news
 varsh 2005 main srilanka ke viruddh apane antarrashtriya kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale srisanth ne apni pehali gend phenkane se pehle hi ye dikhaa diya tha ki ve aage chalakar patrakaron ke liye khub masala dene vaale hai
 His fine control of the run-up and swing at the time of bowling was seen by the people later, but before reaching the bowling mark, he excited himself by punching his fists and then pointing himself with both hands to control his emotions
 To say, such acts were rarely seen in Indian cricket before
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki srisanth galati se cricket main aa gaye, unhen filmon main hona chahie tha
 Seeing their dance on a TV show, perhaps even Michael Jackson would have been jealous of them
 vaise kerala ke akhbaar kai baar ye daawa kar chuke hai ki srisanth jald hi ek malayalam film main abhinay karte dikhaai denge, lekin ab shaayad samay kii kami ke kaaran aisa sambhav nahin ho paaya
 If it were, then perhaps they would have got a great alternative to an alternative business
 unke naam par 'shri 420' film ban sakati thi! vaise jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki unki bahan kerala main televijan abhinetri hai or jija ek behad prakhyat gayak
 So from here we can understand why Sreesanth feels so comfortable during a program on TV
 itani rangeen image ke baavjood srisanth ke saath vivaad aise chipke hue hai jaise ram gopal verma ke saath flop filmein
 Sometimes he is seen on TV claiming a slap from Harbhajan Singh, and after a few weeks, he is called his elder brother by putting Bhajji in a hurry
 had to tab ho jaati he jab kuch saal baad ve kehete hai ki bhajji ne unhen sirf kohni maari thi, thappad nahin! bechaare harbhajan ko aise hi rashtriya villen bana diya, upar se unka khud kaa kariyar bhi danvadol ho gaya
 This is the same thing - we will drown you dear, i will drown you too
 apane duubate kariyar ko bachane ke liye unhone 2006 main apane naam Sreesanth se Sreesunth kar liya tha
 Often, film stars do so, so Sri also took the same route
 uske baad unke kariyar ne kitni udaan pakadi he, ye to jagajaahir hi he; par ab jis tarah ke halaaton main wo funs gaye hai, lagata he ki unhen vaaki kisi baba kii jarurat he! Working with APPLE, one of the top technology companies globally, can be a dream come true for you

 garib kisaanon kii keemat par ek amir netaa ke munafa kamaane kii unki kahani ke saarvajanik hone ke kuch minute baad hi sushamaa swaraj ne gadakari kaa bachaav karne ke liye press conference kii
 Just like senior Congress leaders took the front to save Vadra
 aaj kii taarikh main netaaon ke bich ek hi sawaal he: aglaa koun? kejariwal ko apana siyaasi kila khadaa karne ke liye jaruri he ki ve satta pratishthan ke maujuuda angon ko tahas-nahas kar daalen
 His fearlessness gave IAS officers like Ashok Khemka the courage to bring out the rot in the government
 apni press conference main kejariwal ne duusare naukarshahon kaa bhi aahvaan kiya ki ve unke abhiyaan main shaamil hon
 His colleague Prashant Bhushan said at the press conference, "leaders know that there is no way to silence us
 hamen kharida bhi nahin ja saktaa
 And our skin is so thick that no matter how much mud they throw at us, it will be clean
 anna hajaare ne hamen sikhaaya tha ki saarvajanik jivan ke paanch siddhanton main ek yah bhi he ki aap main apmaan ko pine kii shakti honi chahie
 In Kejriwal, the middle class of the country is seeing such a charismatic personality who can 'throw mud' at anyone
 ’ bhartiya rajasav seva kaa yah purv adhikari na to paaramparik vaktaaon jaisaa he, na hi uske paas hajaare jaisi naitik takat he
 His general personality makes him unusual
 jaisaa ki team kejariwal ke aghoshit siddhantkaar or raajnneetishastri yogendra yadav kehete hai, ‘‘kejariwal kii urja jatiltaaon ko sulajhane, aam logon ke saath ghul-mil jane or unki eemaandaaree main nihit he
 "this energy comes from pure honesty, firm confidence and strong perceptions
 kejariwal in tamaam khoobiyon kii chamak pehle bhi dikhaa chuke hai
 He has been exposed to corruption in the income tax department for seven years in the government machinery
 iity khadipur main padhai ke dauraan tata steel ne unhen placement dene se manaa kar diya tha
 He then pressurized the phone to the company's chairman's office to conduct an interview again
 unki sankalp shakti kaa fal mila or naukari haath lag gai
 In 2000, he took leave from IRS and formed an NGO called Parivartan, which worked on the right to information
 iske liye unhen 2006 main magsese puraskaar mila
 In the last week of July, when Kejriwal decided to break away from Hazare and show his leadership skills, he was actually doing so by strengthening a campaign over ten years old against government corruption and lethargy
 yah tab kii baat he jab india against karpshan ke bare main hajaare ko khaas pataa nahin tha
 He chose Hazare's preferred method of protest on 25 July
 janalokapal bill ke liye aamaran anshan kaa tarika apanaaya or iske madhyam se apni netritv kshamta ko sabit bhi kiya
 Kejriwal's first success came from exposing corruption cases against Vadra
 yah unke liye nirnaayak mode tha, kyonki hajaare or team anna ke kor sadsy kiran bedi va santosh hegade ne rajnatik party banane ke unke faisle ke virodh main unka saath chhod diya tha
 They were describing him as a victim of "whims" in private conversations
 hajaare, bedi or hegade chaahate the ki rashtravyapee ho chukaa yah andolan arajanatik hi bana rahe tathaa janalokapal or pratyaashiyon ko khaarij karne ke adhikaar vaale agenda par hi kaam karata rahe
 On the other hand Kejriwal and his close associates Prashant Bhushan and Shanti Bhushan wanted to jump into the arena of politics
 team anna kii tut sauhardpurn nahin rahi
 "my argument was that this is a national movement that is connecting people," says Bedi
 aisi kisi cheez kii ore kyon janaa, jo hamen baantati ho?’’team anna kii tut ke baad ke adhyay par baat karte hue kejariwal gambhir ho jate hai
 He says, "people knew what they were saying
" har koi hamen upeksha kii najar se dekh rahaa tha
 Many of our supporters left us in August and September
 ab ve waapas aa rahe hai
 According to him, the worst month was April when conspiracies were made against him and his team
 ve kisi kaa naam nahin lete
 "that time was very difficult," he says
 mujhe neend nahin aati thi
 Weight was reduced by 10 kg
 maine phir chuttee lee or vipashyana main chalaa gaya
 Kejriwal has been practicing Vipassana for the last 15 years
 unka kahana he ki mushkil halaat main yah unke dimag ko shant rakhti he
 The manner in which the political section has reacted to Kejriwal's revelations has only strengthened him
 wadra ne unke andolan ko ‘‘mago pipal’’ kaa andolan qaraar diya tha
 Khurshid called them mischievous
 digvijay singh ne aarope laga diya ki kejariwal yah sab isliye kar rahe hai kyonki unhen sonia gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (enesi) kaa sadsy nahin banaaya gaya
 BJP president Nitin Gadkari called him a "mud jumper"
 nijee ninda ke alaava or aalochanaayen bhi hai
 Kejriwal says that he has been forced to enter politics
 ve isliye mohabhang kii sthiti main hai kyonki ve maanate hai ki congress or bijepi ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 He told India Today, "everyone commits corruption
 party matbhed se itar unke hit samaan hai
 There is an undisclosed agreement between them not to attack individuals
 ’’ ve kehete hai ki unki team kaa prayaas desh ko vaikalpik raajnneeti dena he
 According to him, "we are not saying that these leaders are bad and we are good
" system main hi gadabadi he
 We need to find ways to change that
 ’’team kejariwal kii raajnneeti kaa ikkaa darasal lagaataar dikhne kii ranneeti he jo chunaavon main dhanabal kii jagah legi
 As Prashant Bhushan says, "we decided to form a political party because the opinion of the people can reach us so far
 vyakti kargar hoga tabhi log use vot denge
 "they are enjoying the reactions from the political class
 yadav kehete hai, ‘‘hamane dikhaa diya ki ek chota-sa aadmi bhi sach bolkar unhen jhakzor saktaa he
 "team Kejriwal believes that he has changed the way of the game by breaking the methods created by the leaders i
e
 not targeting the family
 bhartiya samvidhan 26 november, 1949 ko taiyaar hua tha or yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki kejariwal usee din apni party ke naam kii ghoshnaa karenge
 The new party will definitely be anti-leader
 india against karpshan ke vijan document ke mutabik ‘swarajya kaa vaada kiya jayega jiskaa arth he, ‘‘janata kaa shashan, netaaon or baabuon kaa nahin
 "in this document, political parties have been fiercely looted: These parties are" electoral machines whose job is to capture voters and use them as bait to gain power over money and to make more money from power
 ’’kejariwal samay ke pahiye ko ghumaakar waapas 1947 main le janaa chaahate hai or bharat sarkaar ko dobaaraa paribhaashit karnaa chaahate hai
 According to him, self-government means the rule of gram sabha and mohalla sabha
 yah unki raajnneeti kaa ‘‘aadhaar’’ he
 The political agenda revolves around the real decentralization of governance, which is way ahead of the provisions recorded in the amendments of the Panchayati Raj in the Indian Constitution
 iasi ke vijan document ke mutabik ‘adhiktam sambhav nirnay gaanv yaa muhallon ke str par liye jane honge
 The public will take these decisions, not officers or experts
 kejariwal kaa najariya yahaan pratyaksh loktantr sthapit karne kaa he
 This arrangement is only in Switzerland
 vahaan isaki aalochana aksar isliye kii jaati he kyonki niti nirnay prakriya bahut lachar he
 Given India's large population, it is difficult to understand how direct democracy will lead to faster and better decision-making here
 aisa tantra bhrashtachar ko khatm karne kii bajaae use vikendrit bhi kar saktaa he
 Kejriwal's economic agenda is frightening for the urban middle class
 unka uddeshy us sanstha ko sir ke bal khadaa kar dene kaa he jisane udaarikaran ke do dashakon main use samrudh banaaya he- mukt bazaar
 The vision document of the IAC, which will be the basis of the party's political agenda, is quite clear in its thinking: development cannot be guided by the power of '2G logic' or 'free market'
 dastavej ke anusaar, vikaas ko ‘samta’ or ‘aakhri aadmi kii aavashyaktaa’ ke siddhant se nirdeshit hona hoga
 This document takes us back to the declining socialism days of Indira Gandhi in the late sixth and early seventh decade
 bharat kaa apana anubhav kahata he ki yah model kargar nahin he
 But parts of the vision document may be widely accepted
 swatantra janalokapal kaa gathan ek aisa hi prastaav he
 The agenda of reform of police and judiciary can also be approved in the anti-corruption environment created in the country
 isi tarah sarv shiksha or sarv swasthya seva kaa agenda bhi sabko sweekaarya ho saktaa he
 But the question is, will these proposals go beyond the revolutionary approach of decentralized and all-inclusive Gandhian politics and Marxist economics? Kejriwal has managed to create public opinion against corruption
 lekin puure desh ko is baat ke liye raji karnaa aasaan nahin hoga ki ve hi vaastavik rajnatik vikalp de sakate hai
 There is a problem with the IAC and the subsequent political party
 vah yah ki hajaare ke netritv vaale bhrashtachar virdohi andolan kii tarah kejariwal kaa andolan bhi dilli kendrit he
 It is supported to a large extent in urban areas, where the UPA is angry about corruption
 ek aisi bhavishya kii rajnatik party ke liye yah baat thik nahin hogi jo congress or bijepi samet sabhi maujuuda dalon kii jagah lenaa chaahati ho
 The task of forming a national party is difficult
 kejariwal ko bijepi se sabak lenaa chahie
 Even after more than three decades of its establishment in 1980, the party is struggling to establish a nationwide presence like the 127-year-old Congress
 siyasat main itihaas ahm hota he
 The Congress also has an age-old experience and a legacy of leaders who took part in the freedom struggle
 team kejariwal in chunautiyon se waakif he
 While Kejriwal and Bhushan are focused on exposing corruption, Yadav is tasked with increasing the political reach of this team
 15 aktubar ko yadav hyderabad aakar krishi mazdooron kii union aapvu se mili the
 He says, "my job is to play the role of a bridge between the anti-corruption movement and the current people's movements
" ’’unhone maharashtra main adivaasiyon ke sanghathan lok sangharsh morcha ke saath bhi baat kii he
 They are trying to link Sarvodaya Karnataka with what they call "a unique nexus between farmers and Dalits"
 unhone tamilnadu ke mahila morche kii ore haath badhaayaa he
 The objective is clear
 team kejariwal alag-alag sthanon par khaas tabakon tak pahunch bana rahi he taaki bhavishya kii party ke aadhaar ko acroshit shahari madhyavarg se kahin zyada vistaarit kiya ja sake
 The team is in talks with Samajwadi Jan Parishad which is present in eight states
 iske alaava jammu, punjab or rajasthan main kaam karne vaali independent democratic party or uttarakhand kii janavahini ke saath bhi baatcheet jari he
 Yadav does not deny the difficulty faced in preparing alternatives, "we tried in 2004 and 2009 together with Lok Polity Manch
 yah paravaan na chadh sakaa
 "but for Kejriwal, this is a future fight
" jab dilli main 2 aktubar ko unhone nayaa rajnatik dal banane kaa elaan kiya, tab unhone kaha tha, ‘‘mujhe apane bacchon ke liye laduya he
 If i don't fight, they will never forgive me
 main haar gaya to kam-se-kam ve yah janenge ki maine koshish kii thi or ve meri ladaai ko aage le ja sakenge
 "in a three-bedroom flat in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, while the crowd was clapping, their 12-year-old boy Pulkit was holding his head in his hand and asking," What is Papa saying? i do not want to do all this
 main to cricket khelnaa chahta hum
 "kejriwal smiles upon hearing this incident, but again the tension of resolve comes on his face
" ‘‘samooche dhaanche ko todakar shuru se banane kii jarurat he
 People have to realize their strength
 ’’ ve chaahate hai ki unki raajnneeti andolan kii shakl main rahe
 He says, "we will not spend money
 phir hamaare or duusare dalon ke bich fark kya rah jayega? logon ne yadi samarthan nahin diya to ham peeche hat jaaenge
 '' Kejriwal says that in the last year and a half, the IAC has invested Rs 3 crore
 kharch kiye hai
 Most of the amount has been spent on sending SMS
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamaare esemes paane vaale do karod sadsy hai
 "if the outrage against corruption is to turn them into 2014 electoral successes, then they will need to increase the number of members

 He also expressed confidence that a Shiv Sainik would one day become the Chief Minister of the state
 unke is bayaan par bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki ichha vyakti main kya buraai he
 Let me tell you that in an interview given to Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', he claimed that his party had controlled the 'modi wave' in the 2014 assembly elections
 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki ab is bahes main jane kaa koi matlab nahin he ki us samay ve bhaajapa se kyon alag hue the
 This time Shiv Sena is contesting 124 out of 288 assembly seats in the state, while its alliance partner BJP has fielded candidates for 150 seats
 baaki siten bhaajapa ke hisse se chote dalon ke liye chodi gai hai
 Uddhav Thackeray said in the interview, 'one day a Shiv Sainik will become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, a promise i made to my father and Shiv Sena founder late Balasaheb
 ' is saakshaatkaar kaa ek hissaa somvaar ko jari kiya gaya
 Uddhav Thackeray's son Aditya has filed a nomination from the Worli assembly seat for the October 21 assembly elections in Maharashtra
 yah pehla mauka he jab thakare parivaar kaa koi sadsy chunaav main utraa he
 It will also be a test for the party whether it can trust the popularity of the young leadership of the party to win the public's mind
 unhone kaha, 'aditya ke vidhansabha chunaav ladane kaa yah matlab nahin he ki main sakriy raajnneeti se sanyas le rahaa hum
 i am here ' uddhav thakare ne ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ke paroksh sandarbh main vyangyatmak rup se kaha, 'main kheti karne nahin ja rahaa
 It is worth noting that Pawar recently resigned from the post of MLA and advised his son to take up agriculture or do some business instead of politics
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki 2014 main jab vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle shivasena ne bhaajapa se saath todaa tha tab unki party ‘modi lahar' par lagaam lagane main kaamyaab rahi thi jabaki puure desh main bhaajapa ne shandaar pradarshan kiya tha
 He said, 'now there is no point in discussing the reasons behind BJP and Shiv Sena (2014 elections) fighting separately
 yah ek jang thi
 There was a 'wave' at the national level, but in Maharashtra we controlled it

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main america ke liye kuch nahin karne vaale america raashtrapati donald trump ke taaja bayaan par somvaar ko tikhi pratikriya di
 He said that instead of making Pakistan a 'scapegoat' for its failures in Afghanistan, the US should find out why the Taliban has emerged stronger than before? Khan's statement comes at a time when Trump supported his administration's decision to stop millions of dollars of military aid to Pakistan, saying that Pakistan had enough to curb terrorism
 Not raised once
 trump ne pakistan kii is baat ke liye bhi aalochana kii ki usne alqaida aatanki osama bin laden ko apane chhavnee shahar abtabad ke sameep chhipane kaa thikaana muhaiyaa karaayaa
 Defending Pakistan's record in the us-led fight against terrorism, Khan said in his tweets, "there is a need to keep the record straight on the statement of Trump against Pakistan
 ’unhone kaha ki pakistan ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf america kii ladaai main bhaag lene kaa faisla kiya jabaki 9 / 11 ke hamale main koi bhi pakistani shaamil nahin tha
 Record needs to be put straight on Mr Trump's tirade against Pakistan: 1
 No Pakistani was involved in 9 / 11 but Pak decided to participate in US War on Terror
 2
 Pakistan suffered 75,000 casualties in this war & over $123 bn was lost to economy

 'apart from economic losses, the Prime Minister also highlighted the effects of the American war in the tribal areas of Pakistan
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare kabyli kshetra tabah ho gayi or lakhon log beghar ho gayi
 This fight had a huge impact on the lives of ordinary Pakistanis
 ’unhone kaha, ‘pakistan bhootal or vaayu sanchaar ke liye mukt line pradaan kar rahaa he

 Trump tell any other colleagues who made such a sacrifice
 ’isse pehle pakistan kii maanavadhikaar mantri shirin maajari ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main pakistan kii sandigdh bhoomika sambandhi trump kii aalochana par hamalaa kiya tha
 He had said that the President of the United States is constantly suffering from historical amnesia

 supreme court ne prafull goradiya banaam bharat sarkaar maamle main haj sabsidi ko sahi tehraaya tha
 Justice Deepak Mishra, the chairman of the bench hearing the case in the Supreme Court, had said that Article 27 does not say that the Center or the states cannot legislate to help religious places
 haalanki, justise mishra ne ye bhi kaha tha ki agar gujarat sarkaar ne dharmasthalon kii madad kaa kanoon banaaya hota, tab bhi muaavja nahin detii to baat duusari hoti
 The important question during the hearing of this case, which has been pending for five years, was that if the government compensates for the damage done to the religious site by its irresponsibility, can it be considered to promote any religion? Second, if the rioters destroy a large commercial complex, should the government compensate for that loss as well? If this is the case then why is insurance done? paanch saal se lambit is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ahm sawaal ye tha ki agar sarkaar apni gairjimmedaari se dharmik sthal ko hue nuksaan kaa muawza detii he to kya ise kisi dharm ko protsaahan dena mana ja saktaa he? doosraa, agar kisi bade commercial complex ko dangai tabah kar dete hai to kya us nuksaan kii bharpai bhi sarkaar ko kerani chahie? agar aisa he to insurance kyon karaayaa jaataa he?

 Galaxy Fold kii disple modane main smood or fast he
 Excellent performance and battery backup
 phone najuk lagata he or ise saavdhaanee se yuj karnaa hoga
 Galaxy Fold has been launched in India some time ago
 kuch log ise kharid bhi rahe hai
 After news of a smartphone with a foldable display for a few consecutive years, Galaxy Fold became a reality and we have used it for a week
 ab is aadhaar par aapako Galaxy Fold kaa rivyuu bataate hai
 Next generation smartphone, smartphone with advanced technology, smartphone one step ahead - such things are being said about this smartphone
 lekin kya ye smartphone vaaki aane vaale samay main practical ban paaegaa? kya companiyaan foldable disple vaale smartphone kii keemat aisi kar dengi jisase ek aam smartphone customer ise kharid paae? aapke man main bhi kai sawaal honge
 Since Galaxy Fold price in India 1
 5 lakh rupee se zyada he, isliye jaahir he ye smartphone sabhi ke liye to nahin he
 But those who are preparing to buy it or are interested in a smartphone with a foldable display, then definitely read this review
 dizin or bild qualitysghaldy Fold ko teen hisson main baantate hai
 By unfolding the phone off, you get a cover screen which 4
 6 inch kii he
 By opening, you get the primary screen which is the biggest and this 7
 3 inch kii he
 Finally comes its rear panel where three cameras have been given
 fingerprint scinar phone said main diya gaya he
 The phone did not turn backwards, so the company has given a locking hinge in it which is called Dual Axis Locking System
 phone ko fold or anfold karnaa kaaphi aasaan he or ye dilicket feel hota he
 There is a feel like using flip phone
 dizin acha he, bild quality bhi acchhee he
 This phone is heavy and weighs 276 grams
 fold karke phone yuj karenge to ye kaaphi lanbaa lagata he or Nokia E90 Communicator kii tarah lagata he
 However, it fits easily in the pocket
 open karke aap ise ek haath se yuj nahin kar sakenge
 You have to use both hands
 primary screen yuj karne par ye najuk lagata he or aap is par zyada force nahin dena chahenge, kyonki aapako pataa he ki isaki screen bich se mud rahi he
 The company has tried its best to make the phone solid, since it is a first generation foldable smartphone, then you will understand it easily
 displaceshamsung Galaxy Fold main jaisaa kii hamane upar bataaya he do disple di gai hai
 Cover screen 4
 6 inch kii he jo 1680x720p he
 Primary Foldable Display 7
 3 inch kii he or ye 2152x1536p kii he ye super AMOLED he
 In the center of the primary display, from where this phone turns, you will be able to see the crease
 haalanki ye krij aapako tab nahin dikhegi jab aap phone par video contant dekh rahe hon yaa phir koi ap yuj kar rahe hai
 If the screen is black then you will notice the crease easily
 fold karne main aapako thodi saavdhaanee baratane kii jarurat he
 Samsung has always been the market leader on display and this thing is well visible in Galaxy Fold
 yahaan aapako HDR10+ kaa saport miltaa he
 Brightness is good, color accurate
 7
 Our experience of watching videos on Netflix and other streaming platforms on a 3-inch display has been fantastic
 haalanki kuch videos ke aspect reshyo kii vajah se aapako upar neeche letterboxing dikhegi
 If you are reading some articles in the phone, then the front camera module on the right corner will hide some text or photos
 screen outdoor main bhi acchhee he, khaas kar aap outdoor main jab isaki cover screen ko yuj karte hai to ye ek acha anubhav rahegi
 The screen is bright enough so that you have no problem seeing the display even in light
 ek baat to tay he ki normali aap isaki cover screen ko zyada yuj karenge
 Because every time, everywhere you will not be in a position to unfold it
 ek haath se anfold karke ise yuj karnaa khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 i have also used its cover display most of the time
 ab yahaan dikkat ye he ki ye disple kaaphi patali he
 However from here also you can do all the work that will display the primary, even you will be able to play games like Call Of Duty on this small screen
 cover screen par company ne agar or kaam kiya hota to ye smartphone or bhi behatar ho saktaa tha, kyonki cover screen kaaphi choti lagati he
 This should have been dragged further and the chin could have been tapered, so that the screen could be larger
 parformens or softwareeghaldy Fold parformens ke mamel main best to nahin he, lekin acha he
 Many experimental things have been given by the company which can be repaired slowly
 software ko lekar bhi company ne kaaphi kaam kiya he
 This smartphone has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor
 multi tasting ke maamle main ye smartphone king he
 The company has done a lot of its software and has made the interface so that you feel that you are not using traditional smartphones
 kai baar ise yuj karte hue maine ye sochaa ki agar is smartphone ko company menstream karnaa chaahegi to Galaxy Note siries kaa kya hoga
 Even if you have not been given s Pen in Galaxy Fold, but there is no answer in Multi Tasking
 Galaxy Fold main aap heavi gaming kar sakate hai
 i have just tried Call of Duty: Mobile
 lekin zyada samay tak nahin khel paaya
 The reason is its display, because in gaming you are often aggressive and touch the screen loudly and there are chances that its screen can get damaged
 badi screen main zyaadaatar eps sahi kaam karte hai
 The experience of using social media has also been fantastic
 videos ke bare main hamane aapako pehle hi bataaya he ki isamen videos dekhne kaa anubhav bhi acha he
 You can do different work by opening three windows simultaneously on the display
 udhaaharan ke taur par video dekhen, twitor yuj karen or iske saath hi watsap par aap chating bhi kar sakate hai
 Here you get the benefit of big screen completely
 cover screen aap utyub video dekh rahe hai or jaise hi aap phone ko anfold karenge wo video badi screen par dikheg
 This support is also given in other apps
 ise aap disple settings main ja kar aneble kar sakate hai
 This is a very useful feature
 alag alag eps yuj karnaa, organij karnaa or ek duusare eps main switch karnaa – ye tamaam cheechein is smartphone main kaaphi achche se kaam karti hai, yaa yon kahen kii best hai
 The phone does not lag, is fast, is smooth
 fold anfold karne par phone kii screen stable rahati he or eps kaaphi teji se lod hote hai
 There are total six cameras in the camera Galaxy Fold
 teen camere rier panel par
 One selfie camera above the cover display and two cameras above the large display
 yani aapako mudane vaali disple kii vajah se photography main koi pareshaani nahin hone vaali he
 Talking about camera specs, the cover display has a 10 megapixel camera
 anfold karne par aapako 10 megapixl or 8 megapixl ke dau camere milenge
 Talking about the main camera given on the rear panel, here is a 12-megapixel lens and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens
 ek lens ultra wide he
 This entire setup is the same as the Galaxy S10 Plus
 rier camere se photography jo hogi wo Galaxy S10 Plus jaisi hi hogi
 We have also told you in the review of Galaxy S10 Plus that this camera module is very good and you can do good photography with it
 ultra wide angel lens kaaphi aakraamak he or isse clic kii gai tasveeron main ek bada kawarej dikhataa he
 You can read the full review of Galaxy S10 Plus by clicking here
 normal photography karne ke baad aapako best quality milti he
 You will notice noises in low light photography
 selfi camere kii baat karen to primary disple ke upar do camere die gaye hai jinamein se ek RGB sensor he
 It has support for live focus and can click selfies properly
 lekin phir se kahuunga ye best experience nahin he
 Similarly, there is a front sensor above the cover display, from which you can also click the selfie, which is the average
 bydaree barrpakhghalady Fold main 4,380mah kii bydaree di gai he
 Even if you find it less powerful in terms of the display given in Fold, but the battery backup of this smartphone is excellent
 isamen bhi powershere or wireles charging kaa saport he
 With the powershare feature, you can charge any other wireless charging smartphone or accessories
 fast charging kaa saport diya gaya he, lekin agar aap ise tradishnal charger se charge karenge to ise phul charge hone main kai ghante lag jaaenge
 Mixed use of this smartphone will provide full day backup
 subah se 9 baje se 7 baje tak chalaaya he or iske baad bhi 30% bydaree bachi rahati he
 Standby backup is also good
 chunki maine aam taur par is smartphone kii cover disple zyada yuj kii he is vajah se byaap or bhi behatar miltaa he
 If you use heavy, you will still be able to use it comfortably from morning to evening without charging in between
 normal yuj main ye aaraam se 24 ghante se zyada chalegaa
 Should you buy this smartphone? Galaxy Fold is an expensive, delicate and futuristic smartphone
 parformens, disple se lekar lagbhag har segment main is smartphone kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 But this is a first generation foldable smartphone, so you have to keep in mind the drawbacks that we have mentioned
 baharhaal agar aapkaa bajet 1
 If you buy up to 5 lakh, you will not be disappointed

 ” haridwar main hajaaron acre main faile apane ashramon ko chhodkar dilli ke pashchim vihaar ilaake main ek sadhak ke ghar deraa jamaaye 54 varshiya ram krishna yadav urf baba ramdev ne 6 disambar ko do-took lahaze main apni baat kahi
 The way the Uttarakhand government has opened a massive front against this yoga guru, Baba is shocked
 sarkaar ne unki sari puraani filein jhaad-ponchkar nikaal lee hai or november main ek jatke main unki sansthaaon par 81 mukademe darj kar die
 Since then, 99 cases have been filed against Baba within a month
 (patanjali yogapith- baba haridwar ke isi pratishthan se kaamkaaj dekhte hai)ye saare maamle 3 se 8 saal puraane hai or us aadmi ke khilaaf darj kiye ja rahe hai, jiskaa daawa he ki chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main usne bijepi ke paksh main jo 126 sabhaayen kii unamem se 93 par bijepi ko jeet hasil hui

 20 november ko mukhyamantri bahuguna ne dehradun main ek press conference main baba se jude benami jameen, jameen ke durupyog, stamp chori or avaidh kabje ke maamle pesh kiye
 He naively said that these cases have come up after the investigation of the District Magistrate of Haridwar
 (ayurveda mahavidhyalay- supreme court ke faisle ke baad manyata behaal)bahuguna ne yoga guru ko naitikta kaa arth bhi samajhaayaa or saath hi yah bhi naseehat di ki mukademon kaa koi doosraa arth na nikaala jaae
 But in the electoral atmosphere, this initiative was seen less as a corruption of Baba Ramdev and more as blunting the propaganda of Baba's anti-congress campaign across the country
 ham mukademon ke byore kii charchaa bhi karenge, lekin usase pehle baba ne taal thokkar india today se jo kaha vah dekhie, ''agar bahuguna main koi bhi gun he or ramdev ne koi bhi aparaadh kiya he to mujhe giraftaar karke dikhaaen
 i am sitting here among the public
 apradhi hum to khulaa kyon chhod rakhaa he?”(food and herbal park- yaheen banate hai baba kii companiyon ke utpaada)kya baba ko gher paaenge mukademedrasal baba kii baat ko sire se khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The lawsuits that the Uttarakhand government is playing today are very old and shabby
 lekin isse bhi badi baat yah he ki 4 june, 2011 ko jab baba ramdev dilli ke ramlila maidan par anshan kar rahe the or police ne andolan ko kuchal diya tha
 Then Baba ran wearing women's clothes
 uske agle roj pradhanmantri karyaalay ne isi tarah ke rajasav chori ke maamalon kii jaanch karaane kii baat kahi thi
 The PMO had then said that 58 crore running on Baba was Rs
 ke rajasav chori ke maamalon kii jaanch hogi
 Today, more than half of the cases filed by Bahuguna are the same
 aise main yah sawaal uthta he ki baba ramdev agar itane bade thag hai to khud piemo do saal main unhen kyon nahin pakad paaya?(ashram- haridwar ke aurangabad gaanv ke is ashram par bhi mukademon kii chaaya)ek saath darj kiye gaye 81 mukademon main se 27 mukademe jameendaari unmoolan bhoomi sudhaar adhinium kii dhara 154(4)(3) bi? / 166 / 167 ke tahaj darj kiye gaye hai
 At the same time, 52 cases are registered under section 47 Indian Stamp Act and out of this, Rs 10 crore
 kii rajasav chori kaa aarope he
