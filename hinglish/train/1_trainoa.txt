 Historical steps of Modi government 3 years of demonetisation were stunned by the announcement of demonetisation on 8 November 2016 Desh Pam Modi's move did not make anyone aware of the three years of the ban
 isaki safalataa-asafalataa ko lekar alag-alag daawey hai, lekin ek baat par har koi ekamat he, vah he isko gopneey rakhane kii jabardast safalataa
 Prior to his historic address on 8 November 2016, PM Modi did not let anyone in the country get a clue except for a few selected officers
 pradhanmantri ne notebandi jaise aitihaasik kadam ke liye apane kuch aise bharosemand afasaron ko chunaa, jinhen desh ke vittiya halake main kam log hi jaanate the
 Who were the people? The part of PM Modi's secret team, this step of PM Modi, overnight 86 percent of the country's cash was wasted and the economy was in trouble
 tatkaaleen rajasav sachiv hasmukh adhiya ke saath paanch anya jin logon ko is baat kii jaankaree thi, unhone ise behad gopneey rakhaa
 Along with PM Modi, there was a team of young researchers who worked in the Prime Minister's office
 saal 2016 main ai economic times kii ek khabar ke anusaar vitt mantralay ke pramukh adhikari adhiya baikaroom team ke samarthan ke saath is puure abhiyaan par najar rakhe hue the
 He has been the principal secretary to Narendra Modi from 2003 to 2006, when Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, so he has a very close relationship with Modi
 jab kisi masale par gaharaai se charchaa kerani hoti to donon aapas main gujarati main baat karte the
 Why secrecy was necessary This secrecy was so important, that by obtaining information in advance, suspicious people would not be able to settle their black money by buying gold, property or any other asset
 adhiya kii nigaraanee main research team ne puri tarah se iskaa saidhantik khaakaa taiyaar kiya
 This team had young experts in data and financial analysis, and some youngsters who handle Modi's social media accounts and smartphone apps
 agle saal upi main chunaav hone vaale the or aise main kuch bijepi netaaon ko dar tha ki kahin party ko iskaa nuksaan na uthaanaa pade, lekin narendra modi ne notebandi kii ghoshnaa se kuch vakt pehle hi bulaae gaye cabinet meeting main kaha tha, 'maine puri tarah se research kar liya he, yah yadi vifal hota he to dosha mujhe dijiega
 'preparation was going on for a year already
 The biggest promise of Narendra Modi's BJP government was to bring back the black money, so there was pressure on the government to take some big steps
 ek saal pehle modi ne vitt mantralay, kendriya bainkon ke adhikariyon or kai think tanks se is baat par manthan kiya tha ki kaale dhan par karrwai ko kaise aage badhaayaa jaae
 In this, Modi had sought answers to these questions about how fast new notes can be printed in the country, how they are distributed, if they accumulate a lot of money in public banks, what will they benefit and who will benefit from demonetisation? However, all these questions were asked in different ways so that no one can guess that the government is planning to do so
 asal main sarkaar ne is bare main behad gopneeyata isliye rakhi ki agar yah soochna kisi bhi tarah se li hoti to yah puri kavayad bematlab ho jaati
 The tribes of Bastar region, who have been plaguing the village deities for every problem for centuries, have the courage to punish the gods and goddesses who have failed to meet the expectations of the people
 yah dand aarthik jurmaane, asthaayee rup se nilamban yaa phir hameshaa ke liye devloak se vidaai ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 All this happens in public court
 bastar jile ke keshkal kasbe main har saal bhadon jarta utsav bade dhooma-dham se manaaya jaataa he
 Here, more than one thousand villages established in 55 revenue villages of nine parganas of Bhangaram Devi area are the main deities of Gods and Goddesses
 bhado maheene ke aakhri shanivaar ko sabhi bhangaraam devi kii dar par sabhi devi-devtaa upasthit hote hai
 The priest here, Sarju Ram Gaur, says that before that the service worship of Goddess Bhangaram is done for six consecutive Saturdays
 is varsh bhado jarta maah utsav 23 or 24 agast ko keshkal main yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 Traditional deities are traditionally welcomed and given a place according to their rank and status
 inke saath pratinidhi ke rup main pujari, gayta, sirahaa, gram pramukh, maanjhi, mukhiya or patel pahunchate hai
 After the puja, a plea is sought in every village throughout the year for happiness, peace, healthy living, good yield and protection of every living being from any kind of divine disaster
 devi-devataaon ko khush or shant rakhane ke liye unhen prathanusaar bali or anya bhent di jaaegi
 There is no provision of worship of any new god without recognition
 jarurat ke mutabik athwa graminon kii maang par yahaan nae devataaon ko bhi manyata di jaati he
 According to Magraj Goyal, a citizen of the area, the deities found guilty or convicted also have to pay a small amount of duty
 bhado jarta main sampradayik sauhaard kii misaal bhi milti he
 a deity named Doctor Khan Dev is also present near the temple of Bhangaram Devi, who has the responsibility of protecting the inhabitants of all the nine parganas from diseases
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki varsho pehle kshetra main koi doctor khan the, jo bimaaron kaa ilaaj puure sevabhaav or ni:swaarth rup se kiya karte the
 Due to his lack of service spirit, he was accepted by the people here as a god and he was also worshiped
 anya devi-devataaon ko jahaan bhent swaroop bali di jaati he, vahiin doctor khan dev ko anda or neembu arpit kiya jaataa he
 Local resident Krishnadatta Upadhyay says that the first worship of Doctor Khan Dev is done in the area when there is an outbreak of the disease
 shanivaar kii shaam shuru hui puja-archana kaa daur der raat tak chalata rahata he, or ravivaar kii subah shuru hoti he vah pratha, jo puri duniya main apni vishisht dharmik or karm pradhan janajaatiy viraasat kaa anoothaa udhaaharan he
 The tribes of Bastar basically depend on their labor as well, so instead of blindly believing their venerable deities, they test them by patting them
 samay-samay par unki shakti kaa aankalan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Temperamental and irresponsible deities are given a chance to clean up, and are also sentenced in public court
 devi-devataaon ko sajaa dene vaale koi or nahin balki unke bhakt hi hote hai
 Significantly, despite Bhangaram Devi being the main goddess of the area, the entry of women in the festival of Jauerta and eclipse of offerings is completely forbidden
 naarna gaanv ke sirahaa rup singh mandavi kii maane to striyaan bhavuk hoti hai, aise main devataaon ke khilaaf jorta main lagane vaali jaidaalat main devataaon ke khilaaf liye gaye faislon par pratikul asar pad saktaa he
 Sirha Nathulal Thakur of Kohkameta says that the truth is that due to lack of development and facilities, the primitive people of this place are living on their problems with the supernatural powers of these gods and goddesses, even though their thinking is quite deep
 sajaa paane vaale devi-devataaon kii vaapasi kaa bhi praavdhaan he, lekin unke charan tabhi pakhaare ja sakate hai, jab ve apni galatiyon ko sudhaarte hue bhavishya main lok kalyaan ke kaaryo ko praathamikta dene kaa vachan dete hai
 This promise is given in a dream to the priest and goddess who is punished
 keshkal ke rahane vaale balram gaur ne bataaya ki is prakriya ke puraa hone ke baad bhagwaan ko nayaa swaroop pradaan kiya jaataa he
 That is, the symbols of the deity are given new form and recognition after the consent of Bhangaram Devi and his right hand Kunwarpat Dev

 When Ngobeni, who lived in Birmingham, was just 15 years old, the king saw her in his fourth wife's palace
 jab use pataa chalaa ki raja usase shaadi karnaa chahta he to vah ghabara gai
 According to Ngobeni, 'the king's wives are kept in the palace, where security personnel are surrounded
 jab tak raja kii ijaajat na ho raniyaan kahin nahin ja sakati
 She can only go to America once a year because then the king gives her an allowance for shopping

 Nagobeni's appeal for political asylum in Britain was rejected in 2011
 pichley maheene use giraftaar kar ditension centre main bhej diya gaya tha
 However, he was later released

 These were members of the team of election strategist Prashant Kishore (PK) who wanted to get all the preparations done before Rahul reached Panchaldhari about two hours later
 thik saadhe das baje rahul kaa helicopter gaanv ke baahar khet main bane helipad par utraa

 Throughout his speech, Rahul remained silent on the Narendra Modi government at the center and the Samajwadi Party (SP) government of the state and the BSP

 Like a program to interact with activists walking on Rahul Gandhi's ramp in Lucknow on 29 July, the grand event management of Team PK was evident in the Khat Sabha but it could not establish Rahul as the farmer leader
 kisaanon ke saamne bhaashan main rahul ne bhi angreji ke shabdon kaa adhik istemaal kiya
 When he talked about the cost of farming, he repeatedly called it 'economy'

 However, the chief spokesperson of the state Congress, Satyadev Tripathi, dismisses questions on the functioning of Prashant Kishore and his members, calling it a ploy by the opposition parties
 karj maafee se mahaungale vidhansabha chunaav main doordaraj se ilaakon main pakad banane ke liye bijepi or sapa ne rathon kaa sahaara liya he
 Now the Congress has also jumped into the fight being fought through chariots

 Chariots chanting slogans like 'debt forgiveness, electricity bill half, support price of tax accounts' will reach every constituency where Rahul Gandhi will go

 '' aam logon tak pahunchane ke liye congress rahul gandhi kii 'devaria se dilli' yatra ke dauraan raste main padane vaale vidhansabha kshetron main logon se maang patr bharvaayegi
 In this demand letter, farmers' name, address and mobile number will be filled with how much debt they have

 Rajput says, "congress will pressurize the central government to get the farmers' debt forgiven

 a day after the Chief Ministers' annual meeting on internal security on Monday, Chidambaram also disagreed with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's statement that the Center was creating distrust in the states by its decisions

 In response to a question, he said that we are distributing documents on how the NCTC works among them before the meeting of Chief Ministers on May 5

 Asked if the central government can withdraw the central security forces if the state takes responsibility in Naxal-affected areas, Chidambaram said that it is being discussed with the states
 unhone kaha ki yadi rajya adhik jimmedaariyaan lene ke icchhuk hon or naksaliyon se ladane ke liye adhik bal tainaat karne ko taiyaar hon to kendriya ardhsainik evam police balon ko waapas bulaayaa ja saktaa he

 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki is siries se australia ke diggaj leg spinner gendbaaj shen worne kaa behad khaas naata he, jisamen worne dwaara daali gai gend ko 'ball of da centuri' kaa naam mila
 Indeed, on 4 June 1993, during the Test match played at Old Trafford, Shane Warne gave a clean bold to English batsman Mike Gatting
 unki is gend ne cricket ke bade-bade diggajon ko aashcharyachakit kar diya tha
 But what was it that caused Warne's ball to become such a topic of discussion, that everyone was convinced? iskaa jawaab he worne kii leg stump se baahar phenki gai gend, jo saamne khadey ballebaaj (mike gaiting) kaa of stump le udi or worne kii is adbhut gend ko naam mil gaya 'ball of da centuri' kaa
 The 44th over of the Australian innings was going on in the Ashes played at the time when Gatting was clean bowled off Warne's final ball in the same over
 ball is kadar ghumi ki gaiting ko samajhane tak kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 He could not believe how Warne's ball hit his off stump
 shen worne kii vah ball kisi karishmai gend se kam nahin thi
 All the world's cricket analysts, including Gating, were taken aback by this ball of Warne

 What comes to our mind when we think of Varanasi? We think of the gorgeous silky saris and the beautiful view of the sunrise over the ghats

 Varanasi has been considered the "holiest Hindu city"
 banaras yani vah naam, jisase yahaan ke nivasee ise pukarana pasand karte hai
 The city has been important for centuries and also matters in modern India
 sirf isliye nahin ki yah ‘‘sabase pracheen hindu shahar’’ he, balki apni vilakshan, dharmanirpeksh or sarvlokik masti kii vajah se bhi jo khuli, santulit or srujanaatmak he
 This fun has developed for centuries from the confluence of commerce, culture, art, education and religion
 puraanon ke anusaar pracheen kaal main varanasi ‘‘aanandavan’’ tha, jo lambii jadon vaale chaandi jaisi ghaas se bharaa hua tha
 It was called kash and it was submerged by streams which used to rise and fall according to the rhythm of the river
 pracheen kaal se hi varanasi devataaon or manushyon, donon kii pasand rahi he
 Nearly three thousand years ago, local gods like Gan, Ganesh, Naga, Yaksha and Devi lived in Anandvan
 in sthaneey devataaon main se hi hinduon ke mahaan vishnu, shiv tathaa devi kaa udai hua or unhone apane ko varanasi main sthapit kiya
 From the third to the sixth century, the people of the Maurya, Gupta and Garhwal dynasty developed Varanasi as a stronghold of Hindus and Buddhists: they built temples, dharamshalas and monasteries and avenues for pilgrims
 san 1556 main dilli kii rajgaddi mughal badshaah akbar ko mili
 Akbar was liberal and was very syncretistic in terms of religious views and imperialist thinking
 usne rajput or maratha raajaaon ko prashasnic padon par niyukt kar unke saath gathjod kaayam kiya
 His two senior ministers Man Singh and Todarmal rebuilt the demolished temples and fortified the river ghats
 vishwanath shiv mandir kaa bhi punarnirmaan karaayaa gaya, jisko do baar pehle dhwast kiya ja chukaa tha
 Today this temple is the most important temple in the city

 With the intention of being called a good Muslim ruler, Aurangzeb tried to impose an Islamic city over Hindu Varanasi and named it "muhammadabad"
 usne dhwast mandiron kii buniyaad par hi idgah khadey karvaa die
 The most extraordinary of this was the Alamgiri Mosque, whose minarets were the tallest and are the thinnest towers in Mughal architecture till date
 yah masjid aaj bhi shahar ke aasmaan main bhavyata kii pahchaan he
 This 12th to 17th century period is often considered by historians, both amateur or professional, to be a time of destruction and uproar under "muslim rule"
 haalanki, is dauraan hi shahar main kai khubasurat smarak banaae gaye
 These include both religious and secular monuments
 in shatabdiyon or uske baad beesvin shatabdi ke dauraan varanasi vaanijya, dharm or bauddhikta ke athulaneey centre ke rup main ubhara
 Ashrams thrived in the forests of Kashi, in which many gurus taught their disciples to lead a disciplined life
 desh bhar ke shahi parivaar shahar main apni maujuudagi rakhana chaahate the
 They spent money for this and built large religious complexes along the Ganges
 in parisaron main ek mandir, ek pokhar yaa baavdi, ek dharmashala, ek skool, ek vyaayaamashaala or ek ghat shaamil hota tha
 There was a wave of migrants in the city
 pashchim, dakshin or purvi bharat main samudaayon ke vikaas ke saath hi varanasi saarvbhaumik centre ban gaya he, ek aisa shahar jo puure bharat ko aakarshith karata tha
 This area of sandstone was filled with shady lanes
 alag-alag muhalle viksit kiye gaye, jinamein ghat or anya saamudayik sthaan the
 These neighborhoods competed with each other
 inke bich kushti or gayan pratiyogitaayen yojit kii jaati thi
 In the workshops on the side of the streets, the craftsmen used to make dazzling objects and clothes from wood, stone and silk
 in vastuon ko thok bazaar main le jaaya jaataa or iske baad vyapaar ke liye ganga main badi naavon par ladakar baahar bheja jaataa tha
 It is because of this confluence of commerce, religion, art and education that a joyous Banarasi fun has been created, which still remains in its streets and neighborhoods
 yah jivan ke prati ek aisa ravaiya tha jo darshanik or vyaavhaarik donon tha
 It was a struggle between hard work and leisure and with the same activism also recognized the association of culture, classes and religions
 kai vidwaan shahar ko ‘‘purv-aadhunik’’ kehete hai kyonki varanasi audyogikaran se achoota rahaa he
 The city has craft-related cottage industries, such as weaving, embroidery, stone, metal and woodwork
 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki gharon main hone vaale in utpaadanon se aazaadee or khushi kii samskruti panpi he
 An anthropologist has written about the simile that the people of Varanasi like the most - that of openness

 jab unase taaja raajnneetik-prashasnic sthiti or sahitya ke prati sarkaar ke ravaie ko lekar baat kii gai, to unhone dil kii baat saamne rakh di
 Here is the 14th installment of 'bihar diary before election'
 
 
 arriya main faniswarnath renu kaa gaanv us hive se thodaa hi dakshin he, jo vaaya bihar, assam se gujarat tak chali jaati he
 aurahi-hingna is directly associated with Gujarat and Renu's son became an MLA from Narendra Modi's party
 bijepi ne maati ke is laal ko kaayade se apanaaya he
 South of the highway is a single lane road, which moves forcefully between corn fields and malnourished children
 zyaadaatar gharon par tin yaa esbestus kii chhaten hai
 There is a haat in front, where a fresh shining bronze statue of Renu is seen
 ilaake ke sab log renuji ko jaanate hai
 Going a little further, a well-ventilated hallway made of bamboo and thatch is seen, which has pictures of Renu and his wife
 usee dalan main renu kii tasviir se bilkul satee hui narendra modi kii tasviren hai
 Outside the hallway is the barn-ground, in which a large flag of the BJP is waving on the high bamboo
 jagah-jagah bans ke khunte par modi kii tasviren tangi hai
 Lungi alone in the barn and Renu's son Padmaprag Venu, the MLA from Farbisganj, are sitting in Bundi, all alone
 koi sarkari guard nahin, koi gadiyon kii qatari nahin
 Not a fat, blonde-smooth, pimp worker
 aisa vidhayak jindagi main pehali baar dekh rahaa hum
 As a child, he used to look at Madhubani MP Bhogendra Jha from CPI
 chaay ke liye ek aadmi ko ishaara karte hai
 We talk for an hour and a half - old things, new things, in Maithili, in Hindi
 renu ne ‘mailaa anchal’ or ‘parati pariktha’ yaheen likhi thi
 The Prime Minister of the country has also sat in that barn for two hours
 maujuuda system or nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf ubal padate hai vidhayakaji
 The reticent Padmaparag Venu is very angry against the arbitrariness of bureaucrats
 hamane poocha ki is baar kiski hawa he?ve muskuraate hue bole, ‘dekhie ham to bijepi ke vidhayak hai
 We feel like BJP only
 ’kya ye dalan vaisaa hi he, jaisaa pehle tha?‘nahin
 
 
 Some repairs have been done
 ’'bijepi main renu ke bete ko kaisaa lagata he?'kuch der chup rahe, phir bole, ‘na gam he, na khushi he
 My father was treated similarly by political parties, by all parties
 log samajhate the ki bada lekhak he, pad de diya, to haaavee ho jayega, behatar he ki isse press relies or bhaashan likhwaao
 
 
 "where do you live most of the time, in Patna or in the village?" i live here in the area
 jab vidhansabha kaa satr chalata he, to patna chalaa jaataa hum
 This time he too left and came three days ago
 vahaan kuch khaas nahin hota, sirf hangaamaa hota he
 It is the will of the government, the bill which is the mind, is passed
 adhikari kisi kii nahin sunate
 Padmaparag Venu says that the government closed the MLA fund
 iskaa matlab yah tha ki saare vidhayak chor hai
 They say, 'hey brother, you used to put that money in our account only a little
 wo to collector yaa didisi ke khate main rahata tha, hamaari anushansa hoti thi
 If you think that something is being stolen, get it investigated
 police aapaki, visilence aapkaa
 But no, they closed the fund itself
 ab log hamase vikaas kii maang karte hai
 What should we do? That means the government does not listen to the legislators
 vipaksh kii to or bhi nahin
 'we are public representatives, but we are left at the mercy of the authorities
 ’ve aage kehete hai, ‘dekhie, usne (sarkaar ne) kaha he ki hamaari anushansa par ab transafrmar lagenge
 But i have been following the officers for the last several months, then it is said that the officer is on leave, he will come on Monday
 koi kuch bhi bahaanaa bana detaa he

 'kya system ne, rajya ne unke pita ko wo sammaan diya, jiske ve hakdaar the?'‘dekhie, mere pita janata ke dilon main rahete hai
 People come from all over the country, people from America come to do research
 is dalan par desh ke pradhanmantri ghanton baith chuke hai
 As far as the state or system is concerned, the state did not do much
 patna main renuji ke naam par ek hindi bhawan he- bas uske baad sannata he
 Recently, in Purnia, the Chief Minister announced the university, at least he would have announced his name in the name of Phaniswarnath Renu, but there is nothing like it
 ’pichhali baar jab nitish kumaar sevayatra ke dauraan auraahi hingna aae the, to padmaparag ne maang kii thi ki unke pita ke naam par ek renu shodh santhaan kii sweekruti di jaae
 The Chief Minister acceded to this demand and was allocated twenty-five million rupees
 padmaparag renu kehete hai, ‘darasal aise santhaan kii jarurat isiilie thi ki renuji se sambandhit bahut sari chijen hamaare paas hai, jise shaayad ham aage sambhaal na paaen
 Secondly, researchers from India and abroad come to our village, they want to see the birthplace of Renuji
 unke rukne-thaharne kaa bandowast nahin ho paata
 In such a situation, if there is a government institute where items, books and people related to Renu can be accommodated, then the people will be comfortable and we too
 ’renu shodh santhaan ko banavaane main renu parivaar ne jameen di he
 When we got out of the village, Padmaparag's brother Aparajit was found, who was standing outside the Renu research institute
 unhone hamen nirmaanadhin imaarat dikhaai, jise is saal puraa ho janaa tha
 We had less time, we left
 aparajit ne kaha ki ye aana, koi aana nahin hua, samay nikaalkar aaie
 Renu's sons are really humble and are real common men
 ham us ehsaas ke saath laute ki ham renu ke ghar se aae hai
 
 
 We have come to meet Renu's son

 rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh kendriya pariyojnaon ko lekar bihar kii janata ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Nitish made this remark with reference to Manmohan's statement in which he said that the Bihar government is misleading the people of the state about centrally sponsored schemes and is not doing its duty properly in implementing them
 mukhyamantri ne iske liye khuli bahes kii chunauti dete hue kaha, ‘gumraah ham nahin vahi kar rahe hai
 Addressing a press conference jointly convened by JDU and BJP, the constituent of the NDA, Nitish said that the Prime Minister is a big man and he respects him
 bhale hi vah duusare dal ke netaa hai or unhen apni party ke liye vot maangane kaa bhi adhikaar he lekin vah unase itnaa jarur kahana chahenge ki abhi tak raashi ke durupyog kii kala unhone nahin sikhi or na hi waisi sohabat unhen mili he
 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley was also present with Nitish
 mukhyamantri ne pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko dukhad bataate hue kaha ki duusare par asaty aarope lagaana or managasaint baaten kahana kahaan tak uchit he
 The Chief Minister said that during the elections people keep their say
 unhone ek maryaada ke andar apana abhiyaan chhedaa he lekin agar duusare maryaada ko todakar asanyamit bayaanbaji karen to yah thik nahin he
 The people of Bihar are watching all these things
 nitish ne kaha ki lalu ji kaa pichhlaa lekhajokha sabake saamne he
 Whatever 'kamaal' he has done for Bihar for 15 years, the people will also give a reply to 'kamaal' in the Bihar Assembly elections this time
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki congress party bihar main apana janaadhar banane kii koshish main lagi he or uskaa bhi pichhlaa lekha-jokha sabake saamne he
 He said that when the RJD government came to minority in Bihar in 1997, the Congress party came to protect it and saved it
 varsh 2000 main donon dalon ne ek-duusare se alag hokar chunaav ladaa
 As it is happening this time, in the same way, all his big leaders campaigned in the election and the same things are being said today
 us samay bhi congress ke netaaon ne kaha tha ki ve rajd ke saath kabhi nahin jaaenge lekin varsh 2000 ke chunaav ke baad jab trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti utpann hui or pehle sarkaar banane kaa unhen mauka mila to congress party ne phir rajd kaa saath dene kaa faisla kiya or ek saajha sarkaar kaa gathan hua
 He said that at that time there were 23 mlas of the Congress Party and one of them became the Speaker of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and the other others became Ministers
 congress or rajd ke aaj bhi mili hone kaa aarope lagaate hue nitish ne kaha ki is baar bhi ek tay ranneeti ke tahat ve ek-duusare par sidhaa hamalaa kar rahe hai or uske liye koi pramaan nahin prastut karte
 Nitish said that he has raised the question many times that by whose grace Lalu Prasad, leader of RJD, a party with four members in the Lok Sabha, has got the next seat in the House
 unhone kaha ki yah congress or rajd ke bich ke antarang sambandhon ko pukhta karata he
 The old experience of the people about the Congress party is that whenever it comes to the center, along with increasing inflation, it works to break democratic institutions and traditions and attacks the federal structure
 nitish ne kaha ki is baar bhi desh main manhagaai purv kii congress sarkaron kii tarah betahasha badi he or sangheey dhaanche par hamalaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Expressing surprise at the statement made by the Prime Minister yesterday, he said that he should break away from the party and see things
 nitish ne kaha ki vah pichley paanch saal se pradhanmantri ko bihar aane kaa nyotaa dete rahe par unako vakt nahin mila
 He said that he sought time from the Prime Minister for an all-party delegation to demand the status of special state to Bihar, but he was not given time from 2006 till today
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan par ki centre kii saprang sarkaar dwaara pichley chah varsho ke dauraan bihar ko vishesh package ke taur par chah hajaar crores rupaye die gaye, nitish ne kaha ki pradhanmantri is prakaar se tathyon kii andekhi karenge isaki ummid nahin thi or usamen vah sudhaar karnaa chahenge
 Nitish said that Bihar has been receiving the said amount since the year 2002 and this decision is not the decision of the UPA government but of the previous NDA government at the Center and at its root is the Bihar Reorganization Bill
 nitish ne pradhanmantri se bihar punargathan vidheyak kaa ek baar purvavlokan karne kaa aagrah karte hue kaha ki bihar ko ek hajaar karod rupaye dene kaa nirnay bihar ke bantwaare ke samay usase jharkhand ke alag hone ke samay liya gaya tha
 The Chief Minister said that when the UPA government was formed at the Center in the year 2004, the Prime Minister had talked about giving a special package to Bihar, but he has not received it till date and neither has given special status to this state
 unhone kaha ki iske atirikt ganna se ethnal banane kii anumati maangi vah bhi nahin di gayi or na hi kol linkage diya
 Nitish said that the Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Planning Commission and before speaking anything about the said amount, he would have asked the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission as the central agencies have to spend the said amount
 unhone kaha ki kendriya raashi ko lekar jo aarope rajyon par lagaae jate hai ve nahin lagaaya janaa chahie par kendriya mantri dhadlle ke saath aisa karke desh ke sangheey dhaancha par hamale kar rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar said that the formula that states get from the Center under the scheme is predetermined
 unhone kaha ki desh main jo kar sangrahit kiye jate hai uske bare main yojana ayog tay karata he ki kitna hissaa centre ke paas rahegaa or kitna rajyon ko milegaa
 Nitish said that the states also have the right over the said tax, so the center which gives funds to a state is not pleased
 nitish ne kaha ki jahaan tak centre pryojit yojanaon kii baat he to usamen rajyon ko bhi apana hissaa lagaana padataa he or rashtriya vikaas parishad main use kam kiye jane or usko lekar nirnay rajyon ke upar chhodne kii baat uthaayi ja chuki he
 The Chief Minister said that but here it has been that the Center is keeping more than what it used to hold in the past and less part is being distributed among the states
 unhone kaha ki ve purv main bhi yah spasht kar chuke hai ki 20 hajaar karod rupaye kii yojana aakaar main sattar pratishat raashi rajya ke aantarik sroton ke hai
 On this occasion, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley accused the Center of discriminating against Bihar and said that being an economist, if the Prime Minister had analyzed the current economic situation of Bihar, he would not have made such an unwarranted accusation
 unhone kaha ki vah pradesh kii rajg sarkaar rajya ke vikaas ke liye kiye gaye kaaryo se santusht hai or nitish nit rajg sarkaar ko doosraa mauka die jane kii janata ke bich jaakar unase apil karenge

 aaj sarkaar nyaaypalika ke saath jo bartaav kar rahi he, vah puraa desh jaanata he
 The government's intention is clear that it will not allow Justice Joseph to become a judge
 sibbal ne kaha ki sarkaar colegium ke hisaab se nahin chalanaa chaahati he
 Who has been able to stop old age, but science can give a gift that can not only slow down the increasing age of age but can also prevent its effect to a great extent
 agar ye karishma kuch saal pehle hota to phir bollywood ke tamaam superstar aaj bhi jawan hi dikhte
 People will get the biggest gift of life, people who have reached the last stage of life, age beaten on the face and skinlessness as proof, is the rule of nature, but now people do not need to be depressed because medical science rises day by day Can give them the greatest gift of life
 saugat bhi aisi waisi nahin balki umr ke aankade main kai saalon ke ijaphe vaala uphaar or saath hi babbti umr ke saboot bhi ho sakate hai rafuchakkar
 American scientists have come close to bringing such a medicine to the world, after which it is possible to increase our lifespan and do not even get the effect of increasing age
 neuyork times ke mutabik vaigyanik us mukaam tak pahunch chuke hai or prayogshaala main is chamatkaari dawa kaa prayog bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 More calories are harmful
 Scientists believe that due to more calories the body gets older but the low calorie diet controls aging and the new discovery of scientists will be an option to eat less calories
 jise khaane ke baad aapako hai calories diet kii zarurat hi mahasoos nahin hogi
 According to The Times, Cambridge's Cyrtris Pharmaceuticals of Massachusetts is at the forefront of the use of this new drug
 'resaveratrol' yahi naam he us mirekal medicin kaa jisame umr kii raftaar ko dhimaa karne kii takat he
 Although some scientists are also apprehensive about it, but if the experiment is successful then the result will surely be a big wonder in the world of science
 chuhon par ho rahaa he prayogphote jaanwaron or chuhon par iskaa prayog kuch had tak safal bhi rahaa he
 Old age means the end of life
 isliye koi nahin chahta ki javaani kaa daur kabhi khatm ho
 The exercise of finding the recipe of evergreen youth started with this desire of the people
 aaj america prayogshaala main umr kii raftaar ko dhimaa karne kii kavayad joro se jari he
 According to scientists, increasing age and acceleration of old age depends to a large extent on the way of eating
 usame bhi agar khaane main calories zyada ho to phir budhaape kaa asar bhi jaldi dikhne lagata he
 That is, if we can save as much from high calorie diet, we can push away old age as much but it is really difficult to do so
 hai calories diet kii chahat hogi purissirtuin acteweater' yahi naam he dawaaon ke aise samooh kaa jo insaan kii hai calories diet kii chahat ko puraa karegaa
 Resveratrol is one of those important drug names
 sharir main maujuud protein sirtuin koshikaon main urja ke strot kii khoj karata he or resaveratrol sirtuin ko prerit karne kaa kaam karegaa jo hai calories kii zarurat ko puraa karegaa
 The result will be that the body will not feel the need for more calories
 philhal chuhon ko paushtik lekin saamaanya calories se 30 pratishat kam calories vaali khuraaq par rakhaa gaya
 The result was very shocking because low calorie reduction in disease attacks in mice also reduced the age of those mice by 30 to 40 percent
 haalanki unki prajnan kshamta main thodi kami zarur dekhi gai
 Scientists and researchers have differences
 Cyrtris Pharmaceuticals of Massachusetts has also started work on the use of these drugs
 mana yahi ja rahaa he ki jab chuhon par kiya gaya prayog kaamyaab rahaa he to phir mumkin he ki insaanon par bhi agar isi formule ko lagu kiya jaae to nateeja yakeenan paksh main hi jayega
 However, there is a difference of opinion among many scientists and researchers regarding this new formula of preserving youth
 america vaigyanik gairi ruvakun, jain wig or jeudith campisi ise ek kori kalpana maanate hai
 According to Jain Vig, the use of these sirtuin activator drugs can be successful on small animals, but its success in humans cannot be stamped
 bhale hi vaigyanik budhaape ko dur bhagane or iske lakshan par lagaam lagane kii prakriya par chal rahe prayog se sahamat na hon lekin itnaa to zarur he ki isaki vajah se insaanon or jaev shodhakartaaon kii koshishon main teji zarur aegi
 Youth science tips in India, thousands of years ago, science may be trying to beat the growing age and there is no concrete and concrete success, but the details of evergreen youth recipe in India have been available for hundreds of thousands of years
 puraanon main darz he chyavan rishi kii wo katha, jab unhen hameshaa yuva banane vaala divya amrit lekar aae the devataaon ke vaidya ashvini kumaar
 According to the legend, the Chyavan sage in the Aranyak forest in Satyuga was so absorbed in austerity that ants had made Bambi on his body
 tabhi vahaan raja sharyaati apni raniyon auki iklauti beti sukanya ke saath pahunche
 Sukanya understood two more eyes of the sage Chyavan, glowing with the ants Bambi, and crushed them with a wood
 rishi chyavan dard se karaah uthe, tab raja sharyaati ne is paap kaa praayshchit karne ke liye sukanya kaa vivaah chyavan rishi se kar diya
 Sukanya continued to serve her husband Chyavan Rishi
 uski bhakthi se khush hokar devataaon ke vaidya ashvini kumaar 52 jadi-bootiyon se bana ek khaas avaleh lekar aae
 With the consumption of that avalah, Chyavan returned not only to Rishi's eyes, but also to youth
 52 jadi-bootiyon ke gun bas ek goli menayurveda ke jaankaar maanate hai ki chyavan rishi ko jin 52 jadi-bootiyon kaa avaleh mila tha, wo chyavanprash tha, jise aaj bhi sehat kaa nayab nuskhaa mana jaataa he
 Now, by looking at the formula of the scientists to prepare the formula of youth, it seems that the qualities of 52 herbs found by the Chyavan Rishi will be absorbed in one tablet
 rapamicine naam ke chemical ko javaani kii goli main tabdeel karne main america ke texs kii barshope institute of longativity and aging studies ke vaigyanik din-raat ek kiye hue hai
 Institute director Dr
 Erlan Richardson claims that his team has found the prescription of anti-aging drug, which is a long-term drug, to a large extent
 20 saal bad jaaegi umrdoctor richardsan ke mutabik, agar anti aging drug insaanon par kargar rahi, to logon kii umr kam se kam 20 saal bad jaaegi
 Currently, this tablet has been successfully used on mice
 35 saal se anti aging dawa khojane main jute doctor richardsan kaa kahana he ki wo to hataash ho chuke the ki apane jite ji aisi koi dawa dekh paaenge lekin easter island kii mitti main mili rapamicine naam ke chemical ne naammumkin ko mumkin kar dikhaaya
 According to the science report published in the journal Nature, a special bio-chemical was found in the soil of Easter Island, a unique island in the Pacific Ocean
 is island kaa purana naam rapa nui tha, isliye chemical ko naam diya gaya 'rapamicine'
 The effect of age slows down
 Scientists involved in making anti-aging drugs claim that rapamycin is very effective on the cells produced in the body with increasing age
 ye aging cells bananaa roktaa he, jisase sharir par umr ke asar kii raftaar sust ho jaati he
 This can increase the average age of a person by 28–38 percent
 nechar patrika ke mutabik doctor richardsan kii team ke saath-saath america kii michigan uniwarsity or baar harbar kii jaikson laboratory ke vaigyanik bhi anti aging drug banane main jute hai or unhen yakeen he ki bahut jald aam logon ke haath main ho sakati he sadabahaar javaani kii goli
 But there is doubt and doubt about the hard work of scientists and researchers
 kai aise ecport hai jo isaki safalataa ko lekar sahamat nahin hai
 Future medicine is used in humans, according to researcher Lion Cox of Oxford University, a drug made from rapamycin can weaken the body's strength to fight against diseases
 line cox kahati hai ki prayogshaala main chuhon par kiya gaya dawaaon kaa prayog behad kaamyaab rahaa lekin insaanon kii umr badhaane ke liye iskaa istemaal kisi bhi lihaaj se nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki antifungus agent rapamycin manushyon kii rog pratirohak kshamta ko khatm kar detaa he
 In this context, the use of future drugs made with rapamycin is impossible in humans
 philhal iskaa istemaal un marijon par kiya jaataa he jinka ang pratyaropan kaa oparation kiya jaataa he
 When the resistance of these patients is hindered by the confession of new organs being incorporated in the body, then it is made favorable through drugs
 budhapa kii paribhaasha bhul jaaenge logahalanki abhi rapamycin kaa istemaal insaanon kii umr badhaane ke taur nahin kiya gaya he ki lekin aane vaale dinon main ise us ummid ke taur par zarur dekha ja rahaa he jahaan se umr ko haraa dene kii kahani kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 Even though the difficulties with the new formula of keeping youth young are being speculated, but it is certain that if the experiment is successful, then what is called old age, people may forget its definition too

 New debate has started across the country since Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of triple talaq in the interest of Muslim women, but still the name of stopping the divorce of Muslim women on behalf of her husband Used to be
 ab aisa hi ek maamla gujarat ke surat main saamne aayaa he, jahaan ek muslim pati ne apni patni ko phone par talaaq dekar sagi saali ke saath faraar ho gaya
 Zainab Bibi, married in Tayabi locality of Jhapa Bazar area of surat, was married to Mohammad Qasim three years ago
 nikaah ke baad donon kaa vaivaahik jivan thik-thaak chal rahaa tha
 But for the past few days, a quarrel between the two started on a minor issue
 jainab bibi or mohammad kasim kaa ek saal kaa betaa bhi he
 This time when Zainab came to her father's house, then suddenly the husband got a call
 jainab ko laga ki pati unase kuch baat karnaa chahta he, lekin pati ne phone par jo kuch kaha, usase jainab bibi ke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 Mohammad Qasim called divorce three times over the phone and these three words took away everything from Zainab
 jainab bibi teen talaak sunakar sunn rah gayi
 Before she could tell her husband, who gave the phone layer, Mohammad Qasim disconnected the phone before that
 shaali ke saath bhagkar kiya nikahjaynab bibi ko talaak dene ke baad mohammad kasim ne unki hi choti bahan yani apni shaali nashim banu ke saath bhagkar nikaah kar liya he

 Former Democratic Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who aspires to be a presidential candidate on behalf of the Democratic Party, has accused China of stealing vast amounts of various government information, including the US military
 uttari new hampshire ke glen main ek party main 4 july ko prachaar abhiyaan kaarykram main hillari ne kaha ki vah china kaa shantipurna ubhaar chaahati hai, lekin america ko puri tarah saavdhaan rahane kii aavashyaktaa he

 After losing the election, Akhilesh Yadav reached his home for the first time to meet his father Mulayam Singh Yadav
 haalanki vikramaditya maarg par donon ke bangale ke bich sirf ek diwaar kaa faasla he, lekin chunaav haarane ke chah maheene baad ye faasla tab pata ja sakaa jab pichley dinon mulaayam ne shivpal kii alag party banane kii script padhane se manaa kar diya
 This meeting of the father and son lasted for about 25 minutes, in which an attempt was made to remove clashes from both sides
 sutron ke mutabik mulaayam akhilesh ke aane se bhavuk ho gaye, unka galaa rundh gaya
 Both kept quiet for a long time
 baatcheet kii shuruyaat akhilesh yadav ne kii
 It is believed that Akhilesh Yadav invited him to attend the national convention in Agra on October 5 as a patron
 sutron kii maane to mulaayam ne rashtriya adhiveshan main jane kii hami bhar di he
 If Mulayam Singh approaches the national convention, then for Shivpal Yadav all the routes will be closed
 pita putr ke bich rishton par jameen barf pighalane kii shuruyaat lohia trust main hui press conference se hi shuru ho gai thi
 In this, Mulayam Singh Yadav had sabotaged Shivpal's efforts to form a new party
 haalanki pita se adhyaksh pad chhinane kii vajah se mulaayam ne akhilesh ko ji bhar kar kosa tha, yahaan tak kaha tha ki jo apane baap kaa nahin hua wo kisi kaa kya hoga

 usee vakt darjanon akhilesh samarthak yuva netaa mulaayam se milane ja panhuche the or unke saath photo khinchvaai thi
 This new U-turn of Mulayam Singh is being considered very important in political circles
 agar mulaayam akhilesh ke saath manch par khadey ho gaye to samaajawaadee party phir se utsaah se labarej ho jaaegi or use wo sanjivani milegi jisaki use 2019 chunaav main sabase zyada jarurat hogi

 Film Name: noordirector: Sunhil sippystar Cast: Sonakshi Sinha, Kanan Gill, Manish Chaudhary, Poorab Kohli, Shibani Dandekar, Smita Tambe Duration: 1 hour 54 minutes Certification: u / a Rating: 2 starsal 2014 by Pakistani journalist-writer Saba Syed in 'karachi' Wrote the novel titled You Are Killing Me, which also appeared as a bestseller
 nowell main kahani 20 saal kii jarnlist aaysha kii thi, jise 'nur' film ke jariye saamne laayaa gaya he
 Based on the novel and how the film is made with the lead role of Sonakshi Sinha, let's know: Story: This story is of 28-year-old journalist Nur Roy Chaudhary (sonakshi Sinha) from Mumbai, who lives with his father
 
 nur kii maa kii bachapan main hi deth ho chuki he
 Two of his friends, Zara Patel (shibani Dandekar) and Saad Sehgal (kanan Gill), are very important in Noor's life
 nur hameshaa real mudde par aadhaarit stories karnaa chaahati he lekin uskaa bos shekhar das (manish choudhary) hameshaa hi use antertenment kii story karne ko kahata he
 Meanwhile, Noor gets to know the story of a gang that runs a huge racket and in which big people of the city are also involved
 nur ye story karti bhi he lekin uski story chori ho jaati he
 Meanwhile, there is an entry of Ayan Banerjee (purab Kohli) in the story
 antat kahani main kai mode aate hai or kahani ko anjaam miltaa he
 Sonakshi Sinha's entry in Bollywood's Bikini Babes: The weak link of the film is its story which is quite boring and moves very slowly, it could have been speeded up and also the novel on which this film is based There are many ups and downs and thrilling elements, but the film has been given a different shape, due to which the story has become very bleak
 koi bhi kirdaar nyaaysangat sa najar nahin aata or kai jagahon par kaaphi khinchi khinchi kahani lagati he
 The film has a big monologue related to Mumbai, whose writing is amazing but could be manipulated in a more powerful way
 ek jarnlist kii kahani film main darshaayi gayi he lekin jarnlist ke ird gird yaa asal jidangi main chal rahi kahani ko darsha paane main sunhill asafal rahe hai
 Why can watch the film: Sonakshi Sinha has done a very good performance in the film which is quite interesting
 vahiin baaki kirdaar jaise sonakshi sinha, canan gil, manish choudhary, purab kohli, shibani dandekar, smita tambe ne bhi sahaj abhinay kiya he
 Smita Tambe has done some amazing scenes
 film kii kahani kaaphi dilachasp he or samvaad kaaphi hard heating hai
 The first and last scene of the film makes you think
 film kaa diarection, lokation acha he or shooting kaa tarika badhiya he
 The music is fine but 'pink Eyes' is a great song
 box offis:film kaa bajet lagbhag 15 karod bataaya ja rahaa he or digital or satelit ritis ke saath film kii cost recovery kii ummid bhi he
 The film will be released between 1300-1500 screens, due to which the chances of getting a comfortable recovery in the weekend are being told

 The era is gone when the enlarged stomach was considered a sign of eating and drinking
 aajkal to bachche se lekar burjug tak slim-trim bananaa chaahate hai
 Most people are upset with their enlarged stomach
 darasal aajkal ke lifestil main jahaan hamen ghanton computer ke saamne baithkar kaam karnaa padataa he, ham ek hi jagah baithkar khaane or sone ke aadi ho chuke hai
 The result of which is our enlarged stomach
 par agar aap flats tami paanaa chaahate hai to apni diet main se rojaanaa lee jane vaali kuch khaas chizon ko hataakar apni is chahat ko puraa kar sakate hai
 Let's know about these things
 packed zeus or soda ke saath-saath, apni chaay or coffee main se sugar ko hataa den
 Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water a day, it will not only keep you hydrated but it will not make you hungry again and again
 doodh pinaa aapako behad pasand he or iske bina aap rah nahin sakate, agar aisa ho to janaab flats tami kii apni chahat ko said kar dijie
 Actually, after drinking milk, the problem of gas remains the same, due to which our stomach starts bloating
 doodh kii jagah aap dahi kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 We use salt in our food according to our test
 kuch log upar se extra namak milakar bhi khaanaa pasand karte hai
 But you will be surprised to know that excessive intake of salt increases water retention in the body
 aise main khaane main jitna kam ho sakate utana namak istemaal karen
 More fries and fattening food will never allow the desire to get a flat team
 isse aapako pet main jalan or dard kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 It is also difficult to digest such food, due to which fat starts to accumulate in our body
 frends ke saath fried or junk food khaanaa ho saktaa he aapako behad pasand ho par ye dhyaan rakhen ki ye aapke parfect figure ke dushman hai
 If you want to get flat tummy then stop eating these burgers and pizza
 iske alaava aise khaadya padaarth, jinamein carbohydrate adhik paaya jaataa he, inhen apni diet main se cat kar den
 Along with the packed juice and soda, remove sugar from your tea and coffee
 din main kam se kam 8 se 10 gilaas pani jarur pien, yah na keval aapako hydrateed rakhega balki isse aapako baar-baar bhukh bhi nahin lagegi
 You like to drink milk and you cannot live without it, if this happens, then let your desire for flat tummy go
 darasal doodh pine ke baad gas hone kii samasya baraabar bani rahati he, jis kaaran hamaara pet phoolne lagata he
 You can use curd instead of milk
 ham apane test ke hisaab se apane khaane main namak istemaal karte hai
 Some people also like to eat extra salt mixed with it
 par aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki namak kaa adhik seven karne se sharir main water rettesan bad jaataa he
 In this case, use as little salt as possible
 adhik tala-bhunaa or chatapata khaanaa flats team paane kii ichha kaa kabhi puraa nahin hone degaa
 You may complain of stomach irritation and pain
 is tarah ke khaane ko diguest karne main bhi dikkat hoti he, jis kaaran vasa hamaare sharir main jamaa hone lagati he
 Eating fried and junk food with friends may be your favorite, but keep in mind that they are enemies of your perfect figure
 agar aap flats tami paanaa chaahate hai to in burgers or pizza ko khaanaa band kar den
 In addition, such foods, which are high in carbohydrates, cut them out of your diet

 In the second quarter-finals of the World Cup 2015, Team India registered a huge 109-run win over Bangladesh to gracefully make the semi-finals
 team india kii is jeet main ballebaajon or gendbaajon ne milakar yogadan diya
 Let us tell you five special reasons for this blistering victory of Team India
 or dhoni kii 'special' centuri bhi hui puri1
 Winning the toss was very important for Toshamhendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya or team india ne bangladesh ke saamne 303 kaa bada target rakhaa
 It was a big score for the World Cup quarter-finals
 bhartiya gendbaajon ko pataa tha ki unhen kis score ke andar bangla team ko simit karnaa he
 The bowlers bowled according to the plan and the Bangladesh team disintegrated in front of such a big target
 vaise, world cap ke zyaadaatar maichon main toss ne bahut ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 2
 rohit-raina kii saajhedaariis world cap main rohit sharma abhi tak us lay main dikhe, jiske liye unhen duniya jaanati he
 But in this match, he returned to his color when the team was in dire need of a big score with his bat
 28 over main 115 ke score par teen wicket girane ke baad bharat ko ek tej or badi saajhedaari kii jarurat thi or is jarurat ko rohit or raina ne puraa kiya
 rohit-raina shared 100 runs off just 79 balls to create such pressure on the Bangladeshi bowlers that they could not recover till the end
 raina ne to sirf 57 gendon par 65 ran banaae
 3
 umesh yadav kii bowlingrohit sharma kii tarah umesh yadav bhi bilkul sahi vakt par lay main laute
 Umesh settled for the Bangladeshi team at 193 with the highest four wickets from Team India in this match
 yadav ne match main na sirf chaar wicket liye, balki unhone ran dene main bhi bahut kanjusee dikhaai
 They only 3
 44 kii iconmi rate se 9 over main mahaj 31 ran die
 This was Umesh's best performance in an ODI career
 4
 The performance of the team The most credit for this victory goes to the performance of the entire team
 rohit sharma or shikhar dhawan ne 75 ranon kii opening partnership karke bhartiya pari kii majboot neenv rakhi or isi neenv kii vajah se team 302 kaa score khadaa kar pai
 In bowling too, the fast bowlers and spinners troubled the Bangladeshi batsmen and included them cheaply
 team ne ballebaaji, gendbaaji or fielding main ek unit kii tarah khel dikhaaya, jiskaa nateeja sabase saamne he
 5
 dabaav par kaabuzldi-jaldi teen wicket girane or middle overon main dhimi ran rate ke dabaav ko team india ne haaavee nahin hone diya
 The Indian batsmen took advantage of their experience to manage the team in difficult conditions, but the Bangladeshi batsmen could not withstand the pressure of the big match and were all out at 193
 bowling main bhi bangladeshi team ke saath yahi hua
 Once rohit-raina started beating him, the bowlers were shocked and the fielders also came under pressure and looted runs

 He said, a special agreement should be signed between India and neighboring countries for import-export of perishable materials
 siaiai kaa kahana he ki yah ek vishwaas bahaali kaa upaay hoga tathaa bharat or padosi deshon ke bich ek hi saamagree kii maang aapurti kii chunautiyon ko kam karne main madad milegi

 Especially the tanu (kangana) on which the film's axis rests is the character is very fickle: glamorous, cool, a modern Chhappanchuri, that too Kanpur

 But the biggest shock is Kangana Ranaut

 In the role of Saheli Payal, Swara Bhaskar has done better than her in every shared scene
 samaj main aata he ki abhi tak nirdeshkon ne kangana ko zyada sanvaadon vaale role kyon nahin die? unke liye mauka tha vidya baalan (ishkia) or priyanka chopra (7 khun maaf, kamine) ke baraabar khadey hone kaa
 Tanu needed a better actress than Kangana
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) adhyaksh mayawati ne narendra modi sarkaar par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke aage 'dandvat' hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki har morche par naakaam centre sarkaar kaa 'remote control' sangh mukhyalay main he
 Mayawati strongly criticized the Sangh for allegedly taking instructions from the Sangh by presenting a 'report card' of the Sangh's three-day 'coordination meeting' which was held in Delhi on Friday and said that an elected government should be given only constitution , His dignity and public sentiment should be bowed down, not in front of an organization like Sangh with 'hatred, hatred, communal and fascist thinking'
 unhone kaha ki bijepi apni purvavarti congress sarkaar ko remote control se chalane vaali sarkaar qaraar detii rahi he, lekin taaja ghatnakram se sabit hua he ki modi sarkaar kaa remote control sangh mukhyalay nagpur main he or uski nakel sangh netaaon ke haath main he
 The comments basapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki desh kaa pradhanmantri or uski sarkaar ke mantri desh kii janata or sansad ke prati javabdehi na nibhaakar sangh jaisi sanstha ke prati javabdeh hokar puri tarah 'dandvat' ho rahe hai
 In a way, this is a danger bell for democracy
 unhone kaha ki har morche par naakaam sarkaar ko shaabaashi die jane se yah bhi spasht hua he ki modi sarkaar ke saath hi sangh ko bhi garibi, mahangaai, berogari jaisi jwalanth samasyaon ke nivaaran or daliton, pichhadon or shoshiton kii koi parvaah nahin he
 Mayawati strongly criticized the Sangh for allegedly taking instructions from the Sangh by presenting a 'report card' of the Sangh's three-day 'coordination meeting' which was held in Delhi on Friday and said that an elected government should be given only constitution , His dignity and public sentiment should be bowed down, not in front of an organization like Sangh with 'hatred, hatred, communal and fascist thinking'
 unhone kaha ki bijepi apni purvavarti congress sarkaar ko remote control se chalane vaali sarkaar qaraar detii rahi he, lekin taaja ghatnakram se sabit hua he ki modi sarkaar kaa remote control sangh mukhyalay nagpur main he or uski nakel sangh netaaon ke haath main he

 He said that BJP has been terming its predecessor Congress government as a government controlled by remote control, but the latest developments have proved that the Modi government's remote control union headquarters is in Nagpur and its leadership is in the hands of Sangh leaders
 tippaniyan The BSP president said that the Prime Minister of the country and the ministers of his government are 'completely obnoxious' by not being accountable to the people of the country and to an organization like the Sangh

 unhone cabinet ke faisle kii ninda karte hue kaha ki yah 'kaala' adhyadesh samiti ke mahatv ko kamjor karegaa
 Ramesh said that this move sends a message that the Modi government believes in Namo (no Act, Make Ordinance)
 upie sarkaar main gramin vikaas mantri rahe jairam ramesh ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne sanyukt samiti main hone vaali kavayad kaa majaak udaaya he, jisane kal hi pehali baithak kii thi
 He condemned the cabinet decision, saying it would undermine the importance of the 'black' ordinance committee
 ramesh ne kaha ki is kadam se yah sandesh jaataa he ki modi sarkaar namo (no act, mek ordinance) main bharosa rakhti he
 Ramesh said that this move sends a message that the Modi government believes in Namo (no Act, Make Ordinance)
 daavos main saj rahaa vishwa aarthik manch (WEF) is saal itnaa ahm kyon he? vaishvik mandi ke chhatne or atlantic sagar ke donon taraf kootnithik sthirataa ke mouhaal ke bich vaishvik arthvyavasthaaen free market ko kendra main laane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Actually, after almost a decade of global sluggishness, India is getting a special start
 pradhanmantri narendra modi barf se ghire daavos main vishwa aarthik manch ke sammelan main ekatra hue duniyabar ke rashtradhyakshon, multinational companiyon ke pramukhon se milane ke liye taiyaar hai
 The country has many proposals to increase the duration of old agreements including free trade, new investment
 or is baat kaa shrey hamen pradhanmantri modi ko dena hoga ki duniyabar kii arthvyavasthaaon kii ruchi bhartiya bazaar main badi he
 However, the foreign trade policy of the Modi government has remained narrow till now due to indigenous pressure
 ab vishwa samudaay ke saamne pradhanmantri modi ko new india kii new dred policy par apni mukhar raay rakhni he
 By joining Davos conference for the first time, he can make big free trade agreements of new era in favor of India
 ise padhein: WEF ke is color map main dekhie kitni he global growth main bharat kii hissedariin nae free trade samjhauton kii sambhaavnaaon ko hawa khud america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne satta sanbhaalane ke baad trans paisefic samjhaute (tipipi) se baahar nikal kar di he
 Trump then took 1 to Pakistan
 9 billian dollar kii madad ko roak di jiske mahaj ek hafte baad hi dilli main america rajdoot kenneth jaster ne bharat-america aarthik or samrik sambandhon ke nae blue print ko jari kiya
 Significantly, before being appointed an ambassador to India, Juster was on the post of Donald Trump's deputy economic adviser
 rajdoot jaster ne kaha he ki america companiyon ko china se kaarobaar karne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, lihaaja asia kshetra main kaarobaar ke liye unhen nae thikaanon kii darkaar he
 According to Ambassador Juster, India is a strong choice to secure US interests in the asia-pacific Sea region
 iske saath hi white house ne bharat or america ke bich nae free trade agreement kaa prastaav saamne kiya he
 At present, the proposal of America is being discussed in the business world
 lekin khasbaat yah he ki yah pehla mauka he jab duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha ne duniya kii teesri badi arthvyavastha ko aadhikarik taur par free trade agreement kaa prastaav diya he
 At present, there are no free trade agreements between India and the United States and bilateral trade is done under the rules of the World Trade Organization
 america main mahaj 20 deshon ke saath free trade samjhauta kiya he jinamein canada, australia, israel, singapores dakshin korea or mexico shaamil hai
 Free Trade Agreement allows trade and investment between two countries to be done without any hindrance
 ise padhein: modi kaa bhaashan, WEF ne bataaya- bharat se zyada ubhar rahi he PAK kii arthvyavastha!bharat ke saath khaas trade samjhauta karne kii koshish main donald trump akele nahin hai
 Prime Minister Modi's new friend Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed a desire to enter into a free trade agreement with India after his recent visit
 agle hafte nai dilli main hone vaali asian baithak main bhi sadsy deshon kii koshish free trade kaa nayaa masauda taiyaar karne kii he
 Significantly, the india-asean Free Trade Agreement has been the most successful effort in the last two decades
 vahiin farvari main canada ke pradhanmantri justin trudo or march main emenual macron ke bharat daure ke dauraan donon desh lambey samay se chal rahi free trade agreement par baatcheet ko nirnaayak str par pahunchane kii koshish karenge
 At the same time, the UK has also stepped up efforts to enter into a free trade agreement with India after exiting the European Union
 kaamanwealth secreteriet ki report ke mutabik bharat-euke free trade agreementch se donon deshon ke bich dupaksheeya kaarobaar main 26 fisadi tak ijapha dekhne ko milegaa
 Hence, the good days of the Indian economy are contemporary with its globalization
 beete 10-12 saalon kii vaishvik susti se vaishvikaran ko nuksaan ke saath-saath bharat ke vikaas ke liye behatar nahin rahaa
 In the last few years, the foreign visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been special, due to the pressure of Swadeshi, his government has not taken further steps in the direction of free trade agreement
 yahaan tak dupaksheeya rishton ko majboot karne ke ahm faisle bhi liye jaane hai
 It seems from the same fact that during the three years of the Modi government's tenure, no free trade agreement has been signed in the country
 ab ladkadaa rahi bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nae nivesh or technology kii jarurat he
 At the same time, apart from aggressive Indian market, there is little hope of taking an economic boom
 lihaaja yadi pradhanmantri modi vaaki free market main vishwaas rakhte hai to arthvyavastha ke daudane kaa samay aa chukaa he or vishwa manch unke liye taiyaar he
 Russia and France have already plagued ISIS by attacking Syria
 ab britain bhi is jang main shaamil ho gaya he
 Here, British Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the attack to the Royal Air Force, and the Tornado Fighter jets began writing a new story of ruining ISIS
 yahaan dekhenis aatanki ke khatmen kaa live videojung main shaamil hua britainpele america, phir america ke saath nato desh, phir rus, phir france or ab britain
 In the ISIS occupied areas in Syria, warships of all the powerful countries are constantly bombarded together
 in mulkon ne thaan liya he ki ab iesas ko matiamet karke hi dam lenge
 And now Britain's name has also been added to this link
 sansad ne di hamale kii ijajatasyria ke khilaaf jang main shaamil hone se pehle britain kii sansad main aies ke khilaaf hawaii hamale ko lekar ek lambii bahes hui
 And finally the British Parliament allowed the attack
 syria main iesas ke thikaanon par yun bam barasaane ke liye britain kii sansad ne puure saadhe das ghante tak jabardast maathapai kii
 Then voting took place in which 397 votes were cast against 223 in favor of the attack
 zarur padhenye hai duniya ke most wonted paanch aatankvaadihukm milte hi aies par hamalapradhanmantri kaa hukum milte hi misr ke akrotiri airbase se british fiter jetts ne syria ke liye udaan bhari
 And with this, fresh bombing of Syrian territory started
 zamin par tabadatod bamon kii barish or asaman main udaan bharte britain ke royal airforce ke tonerdo fiter jetts iesas ke liye badi pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaye
 The problems of common people increased, on the orders of Prime Minister David Cameron, the Royal Air Force wreaked havoc on is-occupied Syria
 syria ke log pehle hi vahaan ho rahe hamalon se kaaphi pareshaan the
 Now their problems increased
 bahut mumkin he ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath-saath aam log or khaas kar mahilaayein or bachche bhi iskaa shikaar ban jaaenge
 Read here: How the US misguides the youth in the name of Jannat, America started the war long before the terrorist organization Paris attack against the many countries that united after the Paris attack
 isamen nato mulk bhi america kaa saath de rahe the
 But after the Paris attack, many countries of the world also decided to directly confront IS
 syrian raashtrapati bashar al asad kii guzarish par rus bhi takreeban dedh maheene se syria main bambaari kar rahaa tha, lekin france par hue hamale ke baad khud france ne bhi is ladaai main rus kaa saath dene kaa faisalaa kiya
 Friends became enemies in the war against IS
 This was the first time since the second world war, when France and Russia together were targeting any of their enemies
 lekin ab is maamle se sabase nayaa mode britain ke faisale se aayaa he, kyonki britain ne bhi france or rus jaise mulkon ke saath sidhe syria main iesas ke thikaanon par hamale kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Now the whole world is waiting for the end of this dreaded terrorist organization
 lokapal kii niyukti ke maamle main ek kadam or badhaate hue centre sarkaar ne purv atorni general mukul rohtagi ko namchin hasti ke taur par chayan panel main shaamil kiya he
 Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Supreme Court that this decision has been taken in the meeting held on 11 May
 court ne poocha ki lokapal niyukt karne main ab kitna vakt lagegaa? is par venugopal ne jawaab diya ki isamen abhi samay lagegaa
 Now the Supreme Court will hear the case on July 2
 lokapal kii niyukti ke maamle main april maheene main supreme court ne kaha tha ki hamen ummid he ki sarkaar jald helokapal kii niyuktikaregi
 After this, the court refused to issue an immediate order regarding the appointment of Lokpal
 tab court ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ke is aashwaasan ke baad philhal koi aadesh jari nahin kiye jaaenge
 On behalf of the Center, Attorney General KK Venugopal had said that the process is on for the appointment of a celebrity
 vahiin kaaman coj kii ore se prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar jaanboojhkar niyukti ko lataka rahi he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Prashant Bhushan said that in four years, he has now appointed an Eminent Jurist
 ye cameti apana kaam karegi to phir saat sadasyeey screening cameti banani hogi
 To make it, seven members will have to be found, which will take at least seven years
 ek yachikakarta ne to yahaan tak kaha ki sarkaar ne ek kadam to badhaayaa lekin dilli sarkaar jis lokapal or lokayukta ke naare or vaade par satta main ai usne chaar saal main ab tak is mudde kii charchaa bhi shuru nahin kii he
 Lokpal Bill was passed on December 17, 2013
 Let us tell you that the Lokpal Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on December 13, 2013, which was passed on December 17, 2013
 iske baad 18 disambar, 2013 ko loksabhaa ne bhi is bill ko paas kar diya tha
 There was a movement led by Anna
 It is worth mentioning that in 2011, there was a big movement in Ramlila Maidan under the leadership of social activist Anna Hazare
 jiske badalokapal bill charchaamen aayaa tha
 After this, on August 27, 2011, the Regulation was passed in the Indian Parliament from 'sense of the House'
 isamen centre main lokapal or har rajyon main lokayukta va citijan charter par jald se jald kanoon banane kaa nirnay liya gaya tha

 rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne aarope lagaaya he ki aazaadee ke baad puure desh main vasundhara raaje shaayad pehali netaa hongi, jinhone desh ke ek bhagode ke paksh main videshi sarkaar ko halafanama diya
 After committing such a big crime, Raje should have resigned on moral grounds
 gahalot ne vidhansabha parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vasundhara raaje ke dhaulpur ke mahal main jo paisa laga he vah paisa morishas se aayaa tha
 The same money is also invested in Lucknow and Delhi
 unhone kaha ki yah karodon rupee kaa maamla he
 If a 7 star hotel has been built in Dhaulpur, then how will the money actually used to come through Mauritius be revealed in the investigation
 yah kisi se chipa nahin he ki lalit modi ke jamaane main ‘power brokar’ ke rup main jo paisa lutaa gaya tha, vahi paisa morishas ke raste inaki companiyon main aayaa he
 The former chief minister said that Vasundhara Raje has not once responded to the media's allegations against her
 pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi maun dhaaran kiye hue hai
 He has not said a word about Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh
 tippaniyan He said that from his point of view either he must believe that these three are guilty or he is engaged in protecting for political reasons
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki rajasthan main aaj sarkaar naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 It is a poor and corrupt government
 raaje kii pichhali sarkaar ke samay lalit modi maujuud tha
 Today it exists invisibly
 unhone kaha, aashcharya is baat kaa he ki vasundhara raaje aaj bhi kursi par baithi hai
 i was thinking that she would probably resign before the assembly session started due to morality

 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vasundhara raaje ne ek baar bhi media ko apane upar lage aaropon kaa jawaab nahin diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also holding silence
 unhone videshmantri sushamaa swaraj, vasundhara raaje or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ke bare main ek shabd bhi nahin kaha he
 The comments unhone kaha ki unki drushti se yaa to unka bhi maananaa yahi hoga ki ye teenon doshi hai athwa vah rajnatik kaarnon se bachaane main lage hue hai
 The former Chief Minister said that there is no such thing as government in Rajasthan today
 yah ek nikammi or bhrasht sarkaar he
 Lalit Modi was present during Raje's previous government
 aaj vah adrishy rup se maujuud he
 He said, it is surprising that Vasundhara Raje is still sitting on the chair
 main soch rahaa tha ki naitikta ke naate vidhansabha satr shuru hone se pehle vah shaayad istipha de dengi
 He said that from his point of view either he must believe that these three are guilty or he is engaged in protecting for political reasons

 bas mujhe do minute dijie
 "we usually repeat this every day
 do minute
 120 seconds
 vakt kaa yah bahut chota-sa tukdaa hamaare jaanane-samajhane se pehle hi guzar jaataa he
 It repeats itself 150 to 300 times before the work day is over
 coffee brake, jhatpat phone kol, gadabad ho gaye printer ko durust karnaa-in sidhe-sade kaamon main se kisi ek ko bhi puraa karne ke liye do minute kaa vakt aamtaur par kaaphi nahin he
 But these are the two minutes that a judge meets on an ordinary day in Patna High Court for an average hearing
 do minute! yah un dher saare khaufnak aankadon main se ek he, jinhen daksh ne bhartiya nyaaypalika ke apane adhyayan main paaya he
 It is a well known fact that litigation takes a very long time in Indian courts
 aisa kyon he? is samasya ko hal karne ke liye kya kiya jaae? desh main kanoon kii hukumat ke nazariye se is deree kaa kya matlab he? is deree kii siyaasi, saamaajik or aarthik keemat kya he? ye un behad ahm sawaalon main se kuchhek hai, jo jaj, adhyeta or vibhinn aayogon ne puche to hai, magar pakke taur par unka jawaab dene main naakaam rahe hai
 There are complete reports of the Law Commission, dedicated to this question
 to bhi is masale se nibatane ke liye kii gai tamaam charchaaon, bahes-mubahason or nitigat sujhaavon ke baavjood kuch nahin badla he
 If we meditate on this change not happening and keep a right finger on the reasons for this, then only two words come to mind - statistics and responsibility
 yah deree kyonis maamle main praasangik aankadon par dhyaan dene kii mukammal kami he
 We know how many cases are pending in the judicial system (the three crore figure is kept repeating from time to time by the media) and some unscientific and imaginary period is also told about how much the judiciary has to handle these pending cases
 Will take time magar deree kii is samasya ke bare main hamen bahut hi kam pataa he
 For example, what kind of lawsuits are they holding the whole system? Judges decide for a long time, yet why is it that there is no serious dent in this huge mountain of delay? Are the judges of one state more efficient than others in the work? How long do different types of cases remain pending in the system and why? How can we maximize justice time? The answers to these questions are very important to bring about change
 phir bhi abhi haal tak aise aankade or jaankaree jutaney kii koi vyavasthit koshish nahin kii gai, jinase in sawaalon ke uttar jaanane main sahaayta mil sake
 Daksha's "rule of Law Project" largely bridges this lack of judicial data
 daksh ke databes main philhal 40 lakh se zyada aise mukademon ke byore hai, jo desh kii vibhinn adaalaton main lambit hai
 In the 21 High Courts with which we have data, the average time pending for any case is 3 years and 1 month (1,128 days)
 kisi bhi adhinsth adaalat main aapkaa koi mukadmaa chal rahaa he to us par faisla hone main lagane vaala sambhavit ausat samay takreeban 6 saal (2,184 din) he
 Assuming that a case does not go to the Supreme Court (and the majority of cases in the judicial system do not), then the average plaintiff who appeals to at least one higher court may have to spend more than 10 years in the courts
 agar aapkaa maamla supreme court main jaataa he to yah ausat samay kam se kam 3 saal or bad jaataa he
 Also remember that we are only talking about the average
 agar aap zyada hi badakismat hai to aap ke mukademe main ausat se bhi zyada vakt lag saktaa he
 To put the matter more accurately, our database revealed that cases of the 1940s and 1950s are still pending in the courts
 mukadmaa darj karwaane waalon kii hataasha or kuntha ko samajha ja saktaa he
 The uncertainty arising out of the delay is nothing if not painful as it puts a question mark on the issues being fought in the courts
 deree se kiya gaya gaya samaadhaan aakhirkaar samaadhaan nahin bhi ho saktaa he
 We can see that if you file a case in the High Court of Karnataka today, you can expect to remain in court till 2019 at the earliest
 in 2 saal or 8 maheenon (969 dinon) main aap takreeban 12-13 baar adaalat kaa chakkar lagane kii ummid kar sakate hai, kyonki karnataka hycourt main do sunwaayiyon ke bich lagane vaala vakt 78 din he
 We can take a look at some of the more detailed figures
 masalan, karnataka hycourt main kul mukademon main 7 fisadi niyamit pehali apilen (refe) hai
 These rfas have been pending for an average of 4 years and 3 months (1,553 days)
 duusari taraf, company yachikaayen ausatan 6 saal se lambit hai
 However, these are just 1 percent of the total cases of the Karnataka High Court
 hamaare databes ne alag-alag adaalaton kii tulanaatmak tasviir bhi pesh kii he
 Trials in the High Court of Hyderabad have been pending for 2 years 2 months (779 days) on average
 is hycourt ke nyaayakshetra main andhra pradesh or telugana donon rajya aate hai, jinaki aabaadi 8
 5 crores
 isaki tulana gujarat se kiijie, jisaki aabaadi 6 karod he or jiske hycourt main mukademon ke lambit hone kii ausat avadhi teen saal or 2 maheene (1,163 dinon) se kuch zyada he
 2
 5 karod logon ke zyada hote hue bhi yah kaise mumkin he ki hyderabad kaa hycourt gujarat kii hoicourt se zyada daksh or chust jaan padataa he?desh main jajon kii ginati vah aankada he, jis par bahut zyada hai-tauba machi he
 But while it is necessary that the judges are appointed in the judiciary, on the other hand, increasing the number of judges will not disappear the problem of pending litigation
 aabaadi ke bainks jajon ke anupaat kii bajaae jis baat par vichaar kiya janaa chahie, vah he aabaadi ke bainks mukademon kaa anupaat
 The national average of the ratio of cases to population (based on data from 513 districts out of 683) 1 according to the data in Daksha's database
 77 fisadi he
 Now if we look at the districts where the proportion of cases against the population is low, it will help us to identify an environment in which litigation rates are low
 or zyada oonchi daron vaale jilon ko zyada jajon or buniyadi dhaanche ke saath behatar dhang se bharaa ja saktaa he
 Of course, early settlement of cases is not the only measure of a good judicial system
 mukademon kaa nibatara nishpaksh or nyaaysangat dhang se karnaa hota he
 This brings us back to exactly where we started - the question of time in the judiciary
 hamaara databes hamen bataata he ki hindustan ke hycorton main jaj ek din main 20 se 150 ke bich kisi bhi taadaad main mukademon ko sunate hai
 In this way, an average of 70 hearings are received daily
 is aankade main ek or pahalu ko jod den or vah he kaam ke ghante
 Daily average of 5 to 5 in the hearing of judge cases
 5 ghante kaa vakt kharch karte hai
 That is, 300 to 350 minutes
 jab ham donon aankadon ko ek saath rakhte hai or unamem saral-sa bhaag dete hai to pate hai ki desh main kaam ke boj se sabase kam dabe hue jajon ke paas unke saamne aane vaale harek mukademe ko sunne ke liye 15-16 minute kaa vakt hota he, jabaki patna hycourt ke jajon sareekhe sabase vyast jajon ke paas ek mukademe ko sunne ke liye sirf 2
 The time is 5 minutes and the judges have an average of 5-6 minutes to decide a case
 ham yahaan sirf ausat kii baat kar rahe hai or haa, jaj bahut sara samay aakhri sunwaayee vaale maamalon yaa zyada dhyaan die jane kii jarurat vaale maamalon par kharch karte hai
 But when a person is asked to give a decision on issues related to 70 cases, it is impossible to remove the matter of injustice or impropriety
 yah na sirf mukadmaa karne vaale logon or vakeelon ke prati ninsaphi he (or practice karne vaale vakil hamaari adaalaton main mukademon kii khalis taadaad se paidaa hone vaali anischitata kii tasdik karenge), balki yah khud jajon ke prati bhi behad purvaagrah se grasit karne vaala he
 No society can ask its judges to work in such a state of such stress nor expect them to give justice everyday
 yah tii-20 match main 300 ranon ke pahaad kaa peechha karne kii tarah he
 Everyone knows that it is almost impossible to do so, and knowing that, working is to give both luck and chance to interfere in decision making
 is tarah peechha karne main ranon kii raftaar banaae rakhane kaa dabaav ballebaaj ko bagaiyr soche-samajhe apana wicket ganvaane ko majaboor karata he
 If they had to chase down appropriate runs, they could have scored
 isi tarah ek jaj bhi kuch nishchit maamalon ko laaparvaahee se nibatane ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he or agali taarikh dene kii argiyon ko isliye aasaani se manjuur kar letaa he kyonki uske saamne abhi ek lambii fehrist padi he
 But judges are certainly not the weakest victims of this burdened system
 daksh ne is vyavastha ke asli shikaar vaadiyon yaa mukadmaa karne waalon kaa najariya hasil karne ke liye insaaf kii sulabhta par survey kiya
 This survey asked questions, among other things, about the deep secret of our criminal justice system — about the undertrials who have spent more time in prison than in the prosecution
 takreeban 28 fisadi aropiyon ne bataaya ki ve nirdhaarit sajaa se zyada vakt jail main bitaa chuke the
 34 per cent of those accused of bailable offenses claimed that they were forced to remain in jail as they did not have any guarantees or guarantees
 agar inamen se galati kii gunjaaish or galat dharna kii sambhaavna ko nikaal bhi den to ye donon hi aankade chankane vaale hai
 Of course, the judiciary is not responsible for the entire criminal justice system, but even then these figures make a disappointing picture
 or yahi sabase bada pahalu hai
 People have to pay a heavy price for seeking justice and coming to the courts
 vakeelon kii fees or court kii fees to baari-bharkam ho hi sakati he, ve nijee keemten bhi bahut zyada ho sakati hai jo mukadmaa karne vaale vyakti ko chukaani padati hai
 The survey tried to fathom two prices
 inamen ek sunwaayee ke liye adaalat aane main vaadiyon ke haathon chukaai jane vaali keemten thim, or duusari, adaalat main unki maujuudagi kii vajah se kaam or kaarobaar ke nuksaan kii keemat thi
 Each litigant spent, on an average, Rs 519 per day while she was in court
 harek mukademe main nunatam do vaadi maan len or desh main nichali nyaayalayon kii taadaad (hamane yah sankhya 16,400 lee he, jabaki supreme court ke data ke mutabik desh main nichali adaalaton kii taadaad kam se kam 20,000 he) or harek adaalat main pratidin ausat sunwaayiyon kii taadaad se uskaa guna karen, to ham us kul rakam kaa andaja laga sakate hai jo vaadi mahaj adaalaton kii sunwaayiyon main maujuud rahane ke liye kharch kar rahe hai
 Even on such a tightly bound basis, this amount is Rs 30,000 crore every year
 thaharti he! yah rakam itani baari he ki har paimaane se chaunkaane vaali he
 Even worse is that 1 lakh annually
 se bhi kam aamadani vaale vaadiyon ne apni kamai kaa 10 fisadi hissaa ek saal main sirf sunwaayiyon main maujuud rahane par kharch kar diya
 Paid the second legal fee, so different
 khaskar garib logon ke liye to itane mahange nyaay ko paane se behatar bina nyaay ke hi rah janaa ho saktaa he
 Perhaps this was the reason why 33% of the people we interviewed in our survey had tried to use alternative means of resolving disputes rather than going to the courts
 ve maamalon ke nibatare ke liye adaalaton main jane se pehle parivaar ke bujurgon, gaanv yaa jati panchayaton yaa police ke paas gaye the
 There is no harm in trying to resolve issues outside the courts, but some of those methods used on most occasions can be said to be out of the law, if not illegal
 ye aise tareeke the, jinase insaaf milane kii us buniyaad ko hi chot pahunchati he, jisaki guarantee samvidhan or kanoon ke shashan ne di he
 Yet the real shock is the huge loss of work or business
 yah kaam ke samay kii barbaadi, tankhwaah tathaa kaarobaari nuksaanon kii vajah se hota he
 According to our survey, this loss of productivity is Rs 873 per plaintiff
 he
 If we use the same method we used to calculate the amount spent for each litigant going to court for every hearing, then we can calculate the loss of productivity every year
 yah aankada bhi behad chankane vaala har saal 50,387 ru
 is! It is 0 in the country's GDP as the national price
 48 fisadi kaa ijapha karata he
 If this is not a huge cost of litigation, what else is there? How to do it, who is going to solve this issue? Unfortunately, this is not clear
 nyaaypalika or karypalika, donon hi mukademon main ho rahi deree ke mudde ko lekar behad chintit hai
 In recent years, the President, the Chief Justice and several cabinet ministers have made public statements about how the judiciary is dealing with this crisis and how it is affecting the rule of law
 isliye asal mudda chintaa yaa sarokaar nahin he, kuvat, takat or vakt he
 There are no identified people today who are giving time to the administration of the justice system, in which not only the judges but also the bureaucrats associated with it come and do a lot of work
 ye kaam agar dakshata se kiye jaaen to vyavastha kii chusti main acha-khaasaa ijapha kiya ja saktaa he
 In the constitutional scheme, the High Court (essentially its Chief Justice, who is the administrative head), is given the power to oversee the entire judiciary of the state
 badakismati se mukhya nyaayadhish nyaayik kaam bhi sambhalate hai or, jaisaa ki upar zikr kiya gaya he, isamen bhi vakt kii tangi main jakade rahete hai
 Consequently, except for some enlightened judges, the administration is not given adequate attention and is largely left within the jurisdiction of the registry
 registry kaa dhyaan zyaadaatar rosemara kii prakriyaaon par rahata he or uske paas aise saadhan nahin hote, jisase nitigat str par data sangrah, vishleshan yaa sudhaaron par dhyaan de sake
 As a result of this, the judicial administration has become orphaned in some way
 jab tak ek chust-durust prashasnic dhaancha khadaa karne kii ekajute koshishen nahin kii jaatin, tab tak vyavastha main sudhaar kii kisi bhi koshish ke doorgaami nattejey hasil nahin honge
 Failure to properly prepare and implement the plan of the court managers or to carry forward the vision of the National Court Management System Committee are examples of this
 jarurat is vakt nyaayik or rajnatik ichhashakti kii he
