 Two years after the death of his first wife Jane, former Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath will soon marry his Italian girlfriend Sara Leonardi
 mcgra or sara pichley saat maheene se ek duusare ko jaanate hai or unhone haal main sagaai kii rasmen puri kii
 Jane died two years ago after battling breast cancer for a long time
 mcgra ne iske do saal baad 28 varshiya sara se pichley saptaah sagaai kii jo interior diziner hai
 "we got engaged and we are really happy," mcgraw told the Sun newspaper
 ’’ is 40 varshiya cricketer ke manager warren craig ne bhi is samachar kii pushti kii
 He said, "they got engaged a week ago
 glen or sara ne kisi patrika se is bare main baat nahin kii 
 They do not plan to talk to anyone about their engagement
 ’ This has happened many times in the history of cricket, when we saw two brothers playing together
 
 
 australia ke behtareen khilaadi rahe mark or steve wa, pakistan ke kamran or umr akmal, bharat ke mohinder or surendra amarnath, bharat ke hi irfan or yusuf pathan, newzealand ke brandan or nathan makkulam, zimbabwe ke endi or grant flower, sabhi aise hi udhaaharan hai
 
 
 But this time the two brothers who are showing the best in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 are Neil and Kevin o'brien
 
 
 in donon bhaaiyon ne ireland team ke liye shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 
 
 Due to the excellent play of both, Ireland managed to defeat the big teams in the World Cup
 
 
 yahaan tak ki agar is vakt world cap main ireland kii charchaa ho rahi he, to in donon bhaaiyon kii badaulat hi
 
 
 In the 2007 World Cup too, Ireland had defeated Pakistan in a big upset, and in that match also these brothers showed a great game
 
 
 17 march, 2007 ko kingston main khele gaye match main ireland ne pakistan ko teen wicket se haraaya tha, or isamen nil o'bryan ne 72 ran kii shandaar pari kheli thi, jabaki kevin 16 ran par note out rahe the
 
 
 During the fielding, Nathan took two great catches as a wicket-keeper and Kevin bowled well to take one wicket for 29 runs in six overs
 
 
 is match main shandaar khel ke liye nil o'bryan ko 'main of da match' bhi chunaa gaya tha
 
 
 Let us now talk about the 2011 World Cup
 
 
 is sanskaran main ireland ne england jaisi shandaar team ko maat di thi or us jeet ke peeche bhi kevin o'bryan kaa hi haath tha
 
 
 In this match played in Bengaluru on March 2, 2011, England had set a target of 328 runs in front of Ireland, which was really big for a team considered weak like Ireland
 
 
 yah lakshya tab or bhi bada lagane laga tha, jab ireland kii team 24
 Had lost five wickets for 111 runs in 2 overs
 
 
 ireland ke samarthak maayoos ho gaye the, or yahaan tak ki o'bryan bandhuon ke pita brandan o'bryan bhi stand main maayoos hi baithe the, lekin us samay jaise kevin ne apane pita ke man kii baat pard lee, or shandaar batting karte hue england se match chin liya
 
 
 Kevin, who came in to bat at number six, scored 113 off 63 balls, including 13 fours and six sixes, and eventually Ireland won the match by three wickets, which of course Kevin o'brien was the 'man of the match'
 Were selected
 
 
 
 
 
 And now in the 2015 World Cup, Ireland is performing brilliantly
 
 
 abhi tak ireland ne do match khele hai, or donon jeetne main kaamyaab rahaa he
 
 
 Ireland beat the West Indies by four wickets in a match played at the Oval on 16 February, chasing a 305-run target
 
 
 is match main nil o'bryan ne shandaar batting karte hue 60 gendon main 79 naabad ran banaae
 
 
 Ireland have defeated the UAE in their second match
 
 
 yah match bhi ireland ne 279 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue jeeta
 
 
 When Ireland 34
 2 over main chah wicket khokar sirf 131 ran bana paaya tha, or lagbhag nishchit dikh rahi haar kii taraf bad rahaa tha, kevin o'bryan ne ek baar phir shandaar ballebaaji karte hue ireland ko jeet dilaai
 
 
 Kevin played fast, scoring 50 runs off 25 balls, including eight fours and two sixes, and Ireland eventually won the match by two wickets
 
 
 so, main ek baar phir kahana chahta hum
 
 
 Ireland can make a big upset in the 2015 World Cup
 
 
 ireland kii team semifinal tak pahunchane kii takat rakhti he, or agar ek-do bade match jeet liye, to yah final tak bhi pahunch sakati he

 pyaar ek aisa khubasurat ehsaas he jo kisi bhi umr ke logon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Most people want to realize this feeling
 lekin akasar dekha jaataa he ki shuruaati dinon main log is pyaar ke rishte main is tarah kho jate hai ki unako pyaar ke alaava koi doosraa rishta acha hi nahin lagata he
 But it is said that everything changes with time
 aisa hi kuch pyaar ke rishte main bhi hota he
 After some time, the glow of relationships starts to fade and the love between people takes the place of tension
 is tanaav ke kaaran kai baar kuch aisi vajahen paidaa ho jaati hai, jo rishte ko andar tak tod detii hai
 So let us know, some such things which may be the reason for cheating in the relationship
 
 
 1
 Have they become bored with you: The freshness and love you feel in a relationship in the early days, after a few years, it starts to get lost somewhere
 vaise to zyaadaatar log is kami ko dur karne ke liye bahut saare tareeke apanaate hai, lekin aajkal log apane partner ko hi badalane lage hai or agar aapkaa partner bhi har rogerishte ko boring bataa rahaa hoto samaj lijie ki vah ab is rishte ko aage nahin le janaa chahta
 2
 partner kaa nazarandaaj karnaa:pyaar ke rishte main bandhe zyaadaatar logon kii apane partner se yah shikaayat hoti he ki wo unhen samay nahin de pate
 In today's lifestyle, people have become so busy that they do not have time for anything
 samay naa milane kii vajah se vyakti ko lagata he ki uskaa partner use nazarandaaj kar rahaa he
 Because of which they form a relationship with another person who takes care of them
 3
 Jealous of partner's achievements: In today's changing life, be it boy or girl, everyone wants to achieve success
 logon main ek duusare se aage badhane kaa yahi josharishte ko kamjor kar detaa he
 It is often seen that when one person gets more success in two people tied in a relationship, then the other partner is jealous of this thing somewhere and due to this jealousy people cheat their partner
 4
 a feeling of insecurity in the relationship: If insecurity starts to be felt in any relationship, it does not take much time to break that relationship
 yah ehsaas sabase zyada tinagers main dekha jaataa he
 Often people do not like their partners' closeness with their friends
 dil hi dil unako apane partner ko lekar asuraksha mahasoos hone lagati he
 Which causes a deception in the relationship
 5
 Lack of self esteem: It has been seen many times that we all get so lost in love that we keep on respecting ourselves and start believing everything of the partner
 pyaar samarpan maangata he lekin kai baar dekha gaya he ki isi baat kaa saamne vaala vyakti phayda uthaane lagata he or kahin na kahin aage jaakar ye baat bhi dhokhaa dene kaa kaaran banati he
 6
 jab partner aapkaa sammaan karnaa chhod de:jab rishta shuru hota he to ek-duusare kii choti-badi har baat kaa dhyaan rakhana laazmi hota he
 But when the relationship starts to break up, then these things start to fall short
 jab aapkapartner aapaki baton or chizon ko grantedlene lage to samaj jaaie ke ab is rishte main sammaan or pyaar sab khatm hone laga he
 7
 partner ko kho dene kaa dar:akasar dekha gaya he ki nae rishte kii shuruyaat main partner ko lekar ek ajeeb tarah kaa dar dil main rahata he lekin yahi dar lambey samay tak chalane vaale rishton main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 This is the fear, many times people cheat because of this fear of commitment
 agar aapkaa partner aapako kisi bhi tarah ke kamitment dene se batch rahaa he to samaj janaa chahie ki rishta jald hi tuutane kii kagaar par he

 Party supremo Mayawati has started a series of review meetings from Tuesday to find out the reasons for bsp's sweep
 basapa kii haar kii pehali gaaj sabhi padaadhikariyon par giri he
 Mayawati has sacked five zonal co-ordinators of UP for their laxity
 jugal kishor, munkad ali, doctor baliram, gaya charan samet basapa ke paanch ko-ordinator samet kaaryakarini ko bhi bhang kar diya gaya
 It will now be decided to assign the assignment after evaluating the situation afresh
 jile ke str par banegaa sanghathanmeeting se baahar nikalne ke baad basapa ke varisht netaa sukhdev rajbhar ne kaha ki mayawati ne ko-ardinetteron ko hotel or gaadi culture khatm kar janata ke bich jaakar unhen party se jodne ko kaha he
 Also, instead of co-ordinator system, work effectively by making the organization small and strong by constituting district executive
 brahman or muslim ko party se jodne kaa jor hoga
 Special committee will be formed for this
 bade netaaon ko kiya jayega sidlinebspi kii yah samiksha baithak buudhvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 In the meeting, the BSP may consider a new agenda to save its vote bank
 is baar party main yuvaaon ko bhi mauka mil saktaa he
 Also some big leaders can be sideline
 brahman, muslimon kii vajah se main haareisse pehle ravivaar ko mayawati chunaav main mili karaari haar ke baad pehali baar media ke saamne ai thim
 He said that the reason for his defeat was the Brahmin and Muslim voters
 mana ja rahaa he ki chunavi nateezon kii vajah se mayawati soshal ejineering chhodkar ab apane puraane formule par waapas aa sakati hai
 The reason is also because the BSP could not show any charisma even in 17 reserved seats in UP
 der se aae to nahin ghusane diya basapa pratyaashee cobaithak ke dauraan der se pahunchane par mathura pratyaashee pandit yogesh kumaar dvivedi ko karyaalay ke andar pravesh nahin karne diya gaya
 Angered by this, supporters of the BSP candidate created a ruckus at the gate
 isi bich mayawati ko gyaapan dekar unase madad paane ke liye pahunche kuch kaaryakartaaon ne bhi andar na pahunch paane se naaraaz hokar hangaamaa shuru kar diya
 On seeing this, there was a shock between the BSP workers and the youth who were creating a ruckus
 is hangaame ke baad karyaalay ke get par police tainaat kar di gai
 BSP supremo did not understand her vote bank
 Actually, Mayawati sitting in Delhi in the changing environment did not understand her Dalit vote bank
 vah paramparaagat tareeke se chunaav prachaar karti raheen
 As long as Mayawati remained in power, she remained in power in UP
 jab satta se baahar huin, tab bhi yahi haal dikhaa
 In such a situation, the vote which is the base of the BSP, it remained away from them
 isliye maaya ab basapa kaa janaadhar badhaane ke liye nai nitiyaan bhi bana sakati hai

 The Delhi High Court has said that if the students who are ranked in an entrance examination are unable to submit the necessary documents at the time of counseling for admission, then they cannot be held responsible for not giving admission to the university
 nyaayamurti sanjeev sachdeva ne kaha, ‘‘chunki yachikakarta adhisuchana ke anusaar mul dastavejon ke saath counselling main nahin aa sake, isliye unhen pravesh nahin dene tathaa baad kii taarikh main di gayi degree par vichaar nahin karne kii prativaadee vishvavidhyalay kii karrwai ko galat nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 The court made this remark while dismissing the petition of student Bhim Shankar Thakur
 thakur ne aagrah kiya tha ki dilli vishvavidhyalay (diu) ko unki degree ko sweekaar karne tathaa 2016-17 ke satr main elelbi paathyakram main daakhila dene kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 Thakur appeared in LLB entrance exam and got 767 rank in OBC category
 rank ke anusaar unhen 22 agast ko counselling ke liye bulaayaa gaya lekin vah snaatak kii mul degree jamaa nahin kar sake
 The comments thakur ne 2012 main snaatak kiya tha lekin vishvavidhyalay se degree nahin lee thi
 He received his degree from his former University of Meerut on September 8, 2016, when the university refused to admit him
 jab vah counselling samaapt hone ke baad degree jamaa karne dilli vishvavidhyalaya gayi to usne ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said, "since the petitioners could not come to the counseling with the original documents as per the notification, the action of the respondent University for not giving admission to them and not considering the degree awarded at a later date should not be misconstrued
" can
 ’’ adaalat ne chaatr bhim shankar thakur kii yachika khaarij karte hue yah tippanee kii
 Thakur had requested that the University of Delhi (DU) be directed to accept his degree and enroll in LLB course in the 2016-17 session
 thakur elelbi pravesh pariksha main shaamil hue the or unhen obisi shrenee main 767 rank praapt hui thi
 According to the rank, he was called for counseling on 22 August but could not submit the original bachelor's degree
 tippaniyan Thakur graduated in 2012 but did not pursue a degree from the university
 vishvavidhyalay ne jab unhen daakhila dene se manaa kiya to unhone aath sitambar, 2016 ko meerut ke apane purv vishvavidhyalay se degree praapt kii
 He did not accept it when he went to Delhi University to submit a degree after the counseling ended

 In this episode, BJP spokesperson Tejinder Bagga reached the Delhi BJP office with mushroom cake and made the people sweet
 uttar pradesh main sabase badi prashasnic or sarkari naukariyon main dhaandhlee se tufaan machaa he
 Aaj Tak has exposed the truth of that rigging by doing a sting operation
 upi pisies main ek jati vishesh par intervyuu or bahut had tak likhit pariksha main bhi number lutaae gaye
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's clan is ruled by the Samajwadi Party from the Parliament to the Legislative Assembly
 sansad main mulaayam singh yadav, bahu or bhatijon ke saath khud virajman hai or vidhansabha main betaa or bhai
 The government in UP is such that some are calling it the father-son government, and some are calling it a brother-nephew government
 logon ke vot se khandaan bhi chunakar aayaa he, isliye mulaayam singh yadav par koi sidhaa aarope nahin laga saktaa
 But beyond the politics of vote, when the Yadav raj gets on the merit list in the Public Service Commission of Uttar Pradesh, it is bound to be accused
 ji haa, samaajawaadee party kaa 'vot bank' ab lok seva ayog main bhi gajab dha rahaa he
 Till now, mps and mlas were being formed in the name of caste vote bank, but now in UP, SDM and Deputy SP are also coming out of the vote bank
 jo adhikari aage chalakar dm, espi, kamishnar, diaiji-aiji kii kursi par viraajenge, unki khaasiyat sirf or sirf ek khaas jati hogi
 Do not be surprised, Aaj Tak has documents that show how in the name of a particular caste in UP, selectively led the candidates to the interview board, then they were looted in the interview
 aakhirkaar upi pisies ke puure imtihaan or intervyuu main yadav jati ke candidats upar se neeche tak chaa gaye
 Yes, Vikas Dhar and Himanshu Kumar Gupta got 102 and 115 numbers in the interview, but Ragesh Kumar Yadav went ahead with the full 140
 ankur singh, vineet singh or abhishek singh ko mens yani likhit pariksha main zyada number mili hai, lekin intervyuu main 113, 115 par hi wo simat gaye, jabaki surendra prasad yadav likhit pariksha main kaaphi peeche hai, lekin intervyuu main 136 number paakar final list main jagah bana lee
 Amitabh Yadav and Mayashankar Yadav also managed to rob the interview numbers in the name of caste, while the qualification of the remaining candidates of General Katgari died in the interview
 sabase zyada bura haal to essi yani shidul cast category kaa he, jisamen 140 chhodie bahut se ummidavaar 100 kaa aankada bhi nahin chhu paae
 Aaj Tak is exposing the biggest scandal in the biggest test of government job in Uttar Pradesh till today
 upi main aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya kis andheri gupha main ja rahaa he
 Working hard day and night, your children reach the interview board, but the final list disappears from merit
 dilli or lakhanu se phone kii ek ghanti ghanghanaati he or sifarishi condidet intervyuu main top karke merit list main aa jaataa he
 The condition of the source-recommendation in Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission in Allahabad is that even the employees of the Commission have started to believe that without recommendation, there is no place in merit
 upi pisies ke intervyuu main 200 number hote hai, lekin niyam he ki agar kisi ummidavaar ko 140 se zyada ank die jate hai, to ayog ko us par remark dena hota he
 The 2011 UPPCS interview was held last year, in which Yadav candidates got the highest marks
 138 se 140 ke bich, jabaki duusari jatiyon ke ummidavaar intervyuu main acha ank paane se vanchit rah gaye
 Now let us show you the list of examinations of UP PCS, which is a proof of rigging itself
 dekhie ki kis tarah se yadav jati ke candidats ko 140 or 138 number die gaye hai, jabaki zyaadaatar gaiyr yadav ummidavaaron ko 100 se 110 main hi samet diya gaya he

 The PCS 2011 examination was conducted last year during Akhilesh Yadav government
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki pichde varg main 86 ummidavaaron ko chunaa gaya, jisamen se 50 yadav the
 All candidates in the Yadav caste, except for a few candidates, got an interview number between 135 and 140
 khaas baat yah rahi ki yadav jati ke jin ummidavaaron ke number mens main duusare ummidavaaron se kam rahe, wo bhi intervyuu main sabase zyada number paa gaye
 Mushtaq Ali, the Head of the Department of Hindi at Allahabad University, has been interviewing candidates in the examinations of the Public Service Commission
 mushtak sahab ne khufia camere par lok seva ayog kii kalai khol di
 He revealed that even if the government keeps the interview board as confidential, the recommendation works somewhere
 upi pisies ke sachiv anil kumaar yadav ne kaha he ki ayog kii kaary pranali puri tarah paardarshee he
 The candidates are scored according to merit
 ise jati yaa dharm ke chashme se dekhnaa galat he
 Anyway, there is no interference from the Chairman or Secretary of the Commission in the selection process
 intervyuu board ko to chaatr kaa role number bhi maaloom nahin hota
 If we talk about scaling, then its formula is based on the direction of the Supreme Court
 isamen to data feed karne par ank apane aap aa jate hai
 There is no basis for such allegations
 baharhaal, uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kii hakeekat kya he, yah ab puri tarah saamne aa chuki he
 In Goa, the Aam Aadmi Party has given a deadline to Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar to show the degree of PWD Minister Sudin Dhavalikar within 24 hours
 iske liye aam aadmi party ne parsekar ko chitthee likhi he
 In the letter, AAP wrote to Naparsekar that PWD Minister Sudin Dhavalikar had claimed at the time of his swearing that he had done his bsc from Parvatibai Chaugule College in 1979-80
 lekin 'aap' kaa daawa he ki dhavlikar ne aisa koi course kiya hi nahin he
 The party has written to the Chief Minister that if the minister has done BSC, then present his certificate in public domain within 24 hours
 agar aisa nahin hota he to dhavlikar par ipisi kii dhara 420 ke tahat giraftaar or karrwai hogi
 In the wake of the year-end assembly elections, the Congress President is on a two-day visit to Ahul Gandhi Gandhi Madhya Pradesh
 rahul gandhi ne rafel vimaan saude par hamalaa jari rakhte hue pradhanmantrinarendra modipar tikhaa hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul said that the youth, farmers and laborers of the country have come to know that Modi is a liar
 modi sarkaar par hamalasaal ke ant main madhyapradesh main chunaav hone hai jise lekar mangalvaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhopal main kaaryakarta mahakumbh ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Targeting PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi said that the Prime Minister gave an hour and a half speech but did not answer his question on Rafael
 rahul ne ek baar phir kaha ki desh kaa chaukeedaar chori kar gaya
 Significantly, for the BJP worker Mahakumbh in Bhopal, 13 lakh booth level workers were called from buses and trains from all over the state, on which Rahul Gandhi taunted that the trains were empty, buses were empty, and in Modi ji's speech Chairs also empty
 unhone kaha ki desh kaa kisaan, majdoor or yuva jaan chukaa he ki wo jhooth bolte hai
 Shivraj is the machine of the plan
 Attacking the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Rahul said that Shivraj is the machine of the scheme, where he goes, he makes the plan
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ne madhya pradesh ko har cheez main number van bana rakhaa he, bhrashtachar, berogari or aparaadh main pradesh number van he
 Rahul also alleged that the Vyapam scam has destroyed the education system of Madhya Pradesh
 unhone daawa kiya ki i-tender ghotaalaa shivaraj sarkaar kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa he
 Referring to Karnataka, the Congress president said that the debt of farmers will be forgiven as soon as the party comes to power
 vahiin yuvaaon ko lekar unhone kaha ki ve unka dard samajhate hai or congress kii sarkaar aane par apni puri takat yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene main laga denge
 Referring to the Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue of Sardar Patel, the first home minister of India to be built on Sardar Sarovar of Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi said that PM Mogi is building the world's largest statue of Sardar Patel
 lekin yah pratimaa 'maid in china' hogi jaise hamaare shart or juute hai
 He said that he wants to see a day when 'made in Chitrakoot' is written on the back of the phone
 kamtanathmandirmen kii poochaa archanisase pehle rahul gandhi pradesh adhyaksh or purv kendriya mantri kamalnath or saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ke saath chitrakoot main kamtanath mandir main puja archana kii
 Significantly, worshiping in Chitrakoot during Pitrupaksha has special significance

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne holland ke khilaaf buudhvaar ko firozshah kotla main hone vaale vishwacap ke group bi match ko aasaan qaraar dete hue kaha ki aage ke kade muqablon ko dekhte hue team is match main bade antar se jeet darj karnaa chaahegi
 Dhoni said on the eve of the match, 'yes i agree that this match will be easy and we would like to win it by a big margin because all the matches ahead will be very tough
 lekin ham aage ke maichon ke bare main sochakar apana dhyaan nahin hataanaa chaahate hai
 The process is important and we pay attention to it
 ’bhartiya captain ne iske saath hi sanket diye ki team is match main do tej gendbaaj or do spinner ke saath utregi
 He called the match important for the bowlers to make a comeback ahead of the upcoming matches against South Africa and the West Indies
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamaare liye abhi tak do tej gendbaaj or do spinner kii ranneeti kargar rahi he or ham abhi usee par dhyaan de rahe hai
 Bowling is showing signs of gradual improvement
 gendbaajon ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki vah jame hue ballebaaj ko kaise dabaav main laakar out karte hai
 He said that the team still lacked options as Ashish Nehra was not fit
 'fitness par main yahi kahuunga ki hamaare sabhi khilaadi chayan ke liye uplabdh hai
 Nehra was still struggling for fitness while Munaf Patel was with us for the last few series but i hope the bowlers will do better
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak kshetrarakshan kaa sawaal he to mujhe nahin lagata ki toornament ke dauraan isamen bahut zyada sudhaar dekhne ko milegaa
 It will remain as it is
 ’ dhoni ne yuvaraj singh kii jamkar tarif kii jinhone ireland ke khilaaf pichley match main paanch wicket lene ke alaava ardhashatak bhi jamaaya tha
 He said, 'yuvraj's arrival in form is very good news for us
 main yuvi kaa bahut bada prashansak hum
 He is capable of batting defensively in difficult situations and can turn the match around on his own
 uski gendbaaji hamaare liye kaaphi ahm rahi he jisase ham chaar gendbaajon ke saath utar sakate hai
 Dhoni said that in view of the tough matches ahead, he wants all the players to get a chance in the league stage but while he has indicated that Ashwin will join the playing XI, he clarified that there is no place for Suresh Raina Is able to be made unhone kaha, ‘aswin bahut acha gendbaaj he or usne hamaare liye kuch maichon main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 When he will be a part of the playing XI will be decided according to the need and time
 ’ bhartiya captain ne iske saath hi yusuf pathan ko upari kram main bhejne kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar kiya kyonki viraat kohli tisare or chauthe number par behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 He said, 'virat is doing well at number three or four
 main, yusuf or yuvaraj bhi in sthaan par khel sakate hai lekin hamen paristhitiyon ke anusaar or virdohi team ke akraman ko dekhakar faisla karnaa he
 Virat plays to his full potential in the upper order and it would not be right to change his position
 ’dhoni ne toornament main ab tak ke viketon par bhi santosh jataayaa
 He said, 'all the wickets we have got so far were good and i am happy with them
 hamaari shuruyaat acchhee rahi he lekin sahi samay par apni sarvshereshth form hasil karnaa mahatvapurn he
 We have to come up with our good form in the knockout
 ’dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki captain ke taur par unhen kya kabhi faisle karne main dikkat hoti he, unhone kaha, ‘captain ko sabhi chizon par gaur karnaa hota he
 Sometimes a bowler has to make a strategy, sometimes even for a batsman
 paristhitiyon ke hisaab se ballebaajon ko badalanaa bhi padataa he
 Any captain makes decisions according to the need
 ’ Looking at the kind of batting that Virat Kohli batted against South Africa's Paes Battery, now it seems that India can avenge the loss of One Day Series in the first Test match
 chauthe number par khelte hue viraat ne centuri lagaai or master blaster sachin tendulkar kii yaad taaja kar di
 His big score makes India stand in a respectable position and if captain Dhoni along with his other teammates take the total score above 400, India can force the South African team to kneel
 viraat kohli jis pojishan par khel rahe the usamen saavdhaanee ke alaava akraman kii jarurat thi kyonki vahaan par khilne vaale ko apana wicket to bachaana hi hota he, ran bhi teji se banane hote hai
 But Virat successfully completed this difficult task
 unhone wicket bhi sanbhale rakhaa or ran bhi batore
 The biggest thing is that they did not let the game slow down
 isse dawaab dakshin africa ke gendbaajon par padaa
 He used six bowlers but could not stop the run pace
 ab captain dhoni ke paas rahane or aswin hai jinke saath milakar agar vah score 400 ke paar le jate hai to hamaare gendbaajon ke liye badhiya mauka hoga ki ve hisaab chukaa den
 Indian fast bowlers will be able to do well here than One Day
 purv captain saurav ganguli ne aaj tak se baatcheet main ubharate hue gendbaaj mohammad shami par bahut vishwaas jataayaa he
 He bluntly said that Shami is the best bowler right now and he can take advantage of the South African pitches a lot
 unke paas pes he, swing he or sabase badhkar samajhadaari bhi he
 He also troubled the South African bowlers in odis and took wickets as well
 udhar jahir khan kii team main vaapasi se ek anbhavi gendbaaj kii kami puri ho gai he
 He has played there and understands the weaknesses of the batsmen
 agar wo chal gaye to dakshin africa ko lene ke dene pad jaaenge
 Of course, South African batsmen have been scoring big in One Day but there is not much room for batting in Test
 unke safal ballebaajon kii bhi pariksha is baar ho jaaegi
 Keep in mind that Zaheer Khan is the biggest enemy of Captain Graeme Smith and does not let him walk
 unhone iske pehle unhen 13 baar out kiya he
 If something similar happens this time, it will be difficult for South Africa to score a huge score
 bhartiya spinner van de main nahin chale the
 Ashwin had got just one wicket but if India score a big score, then they will get plenty of space to bowl and they will be able to do many experiments
 unhone van de se kaaphi kuch siikhaa he or jab tej gendbaaj pich par dedh din gend phenk chuke honge to unke liye ball ko turn karnaa aasaan hoga
 Spinners often perform well on a high pitch
 ab match ekatarfa nahin he or bharat ke liye viraat kohli ne ummiden jataa di hai
 It is to be seen how far Dhoni and Rahane take it
 pashchim bengal ke veerbhum jile main ek police thana ke baahar logon ke ek samooh ne dhaava bolkar kathith rup se ek police adhikari par hamalaa kar diya or ek trinmul kaaryakarta ko jabaran mukt kara liya, jisane baad main police ke saamne sarender kar diya
 Police said that a large group of people, including women, also attacked the police station and station in-charge Abul Ali and took out TMC activist Khilafat Ali from there
 ek puraane maamle main police ne kuch hi ghanton pehle use giraftaar kiya tha
 However later he surrendered
 police ne bataaya ki uske khilaaf kanoon ke mutabik karrwai hogi
 However, no one has been arrested in connection with the attack on the police station last night
 input: bhashaa Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that more needs to be done to deal with the challenge of Naxalism
 unhone kaha ki hamen is baat kaa ahsaas he ki naksalwadi hamaare apane log hai or ham unase baat karne ke liye taiyaar hai, basharte ve pehle hinsa kaa rasta chhoden
 On terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, he said that despite the decrease in terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, the law and order issue in the state remains a matter of grave concern
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki maanak sanchaalan prakriya or pradarshan kar rahi bheed se koi ghaatak tarika apanaae bina prabhavi tareeke se nipatane ke upayon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 Manmohan Singh said that the process of disciplining in the country has become quite complicated in the last few years
 unhone kaha ki kattarpanthi guton, vampanthi ugravadiyon or aatankwaadi tatwon kii badhati maujuudagi ne haal ke varshon main maamle ko or jatil kar diya he
 He stressed that there is a need to pay attention to standard operating procedures and measures to deal effectively with the crowding crowd without adopting a lethal approach
 kerala ke trishur main machuaaron kii sansad kaarykram main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne machuaaron se samvaad kiya

 a retired general of the Pakistani Army has claimed that the ISI had not even been informed about the orders given by Pervez Musharraf Nekargil to his troops entering Indian territory and this intelligence agency got information by intercepting the communication of the Indian Army
 
 leftinent general (sevanivrutt) shahid ajij kaa kahana he ki unhone teen-chaar may, 1999 ko intercept ke jariye kargil main halchal kii jaankaree tatkaaleen iesai pramukh leftinent general jiyauddin batt tak pahunchaai
 Butt then Aziz said that he should keep the documents related to it
 ajij ke anusaar intercept ke jariye pataa chalaa ki 10kor ke sainik niyantran rekha ke paar ‘aakraamak abhiyaan’ chalaa rahe hai
 Aziz was the head of the analysis arm of ISI during Kargil
 urdu main likhi gai pustak ‘ye khamoshi kahaan tak’ main ajij ne kaha he ki kargil ke puure abhiyaan kii patakatha tatkaaleen sena pramukh musharraf ne likhi or khud ise anjaam diya tha
 Apart from Musharraf, three more people were involved in this conspiracy against India

 Aziz says, "apart from these four generals, no top military officer knew about this operation
 yahaan tak ki 10kor ke mukhyalay ke karmchaariyon ko isaki bhanak nahin thi ki kargil main kya ho rahaa he
 The Directorate of Military Operations also came to know when everything was done

 Aziz says, "it was through the intercept that we found out what kind of disappointment is on the Indian side and they are talking in a state of confusion
" aisa laga ki hamaari sena ne kargil main koi bada abhiyaan chalaaya he
 In May 1999, Major General Tauqeer Jia in Pakistan's Directorate of Military Operations said that troops from the Northern Light Infantry and some other units have occupied the vacant areas in Kargil
 ajij ne kaha ki vah apni pustak main kargil ko lekar kuch un baton ko sahi karne ke liye khulaase kiye hai jinka zikr musharraf ne apni pustak ‘da line of fire’ main kiya tha
 Aziz said, 'I believe that if the truth is not brought to light, the blood of the youth will be lost
 main yah nahin chahta ki sainikon ko andhe hokar aag main jhonk diya jaae
 This former official said that Pakistan concealed the facts of war with India in 1971 and now the same is happening with Kargil
 ajij ne iskaa ullekh bhi kiya he ki kin kaarnon se musharraf ne kargil abhiyaan ko gupt rakhaa
 He writes, 'there is no reason to keep it confidential
 sainya drushtikon se yah yojana bahut kamjor thi or taiyaariyaan bhi simit thim or us vakt aisa samay bhi nahin tha ki is bare main baat kii jaae
 People do not even accept it when it is made public
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki kisi ko suchit nahin kiya gaya

 satya, ahimsa, astey, aparigrah, sanyam, aachaar-vichaar main aaj gandhi ke mulya kahaan hai? ve uttarottar apraasangik bana die jane vaale mahanayake hai jinaki sankethik praancegikta siddh karnaa raajnneetikon kii bhi majaburi he or sattarudh dal kii bhi
 While the image of a strong leader like Jawaharlal Nehru is under question, Gandhi is still in need of ruling politics, the opposition and the common man
 bhale hi aadmi sampradayik ho, hinsak ho, lekin khaadi ke aavaran main lipta vahi sabase zyada gandhi kaa prashansak ban baitha he
 Everyone knows how relevant Gandhi has remained in this country, immersed in the clamor of gandhi-gandhi
 gandhi ke gungan main patr-patrikaayen lagi hai
 Look at the institutes of language and literature, universities etc
, all are drawing special marks on Gandhi
 gandhi par achaanak umadi is deshvyapee shraddha ke baavjood na koi gandhi kii tarah jivan style kaa pakshdhar he na gandhi ke satya, ahimsa va aparigrah ke maarg par chalane kaa hami, gandhi ke naam par hamane mahatma gandhi maarg banaae or un par khud hi chalanaa bhul gaye
 They remained as mere paths or paths
 gandhi ke desh main gandhi sareekhe sidhe-sachche insaan gum hote gaye or sataha par bahurupie haaavee hote gaye
 In the name of village Swaraj, villages were made the arena of politics, then election was a farce of democracy
 aise main gandhi ek kavi ke liye kya myne rakhte hai, gandhi kii raah aakhir kahaan or kyon kar kho gayi? kavi geetkaar dow om nishchal ne apane geet main ise khubsuurati se piroyaa he
 Read the literature written till date, this song by Dr
 Om Nischal: Where is the lost gandhi-path? We are the residents of India, we have changed completely on the practice of different language-speaking asthey, non-violence practices, we have taken every addiction
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?rahan-sahan main saadharanpar vichaar main awwal thehamane veda-puraana rachesamskritiyon kaa sambal theham rishi-muniyon ke vanshajmaanavtaa se hue virat
 Where was the lost gandhi-path? Brother-feed in us, thanth-samagam, Nyara Thaham, we were near to nature, we are in crisis
 Now the relationship is soaked with blood
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?ham kudarat ke saathi theham sabake vishwasi thehamamen koi bhed na thagurukul ke rahvaasee thebante hue khaanon main abjitne jogi utane mathkahan kho gaya gandhi-path ?ham insaanon ke bandrub itane khote dhandheraajnneeti ne kas dalemzhab ke kitne fandehua virdohi apana jouskaa ham kar dete vadhakahan kho gaya gandhi-path ?gandhi ne bhi jivan-bharkitne the papad belekintu malai kaat raheunke anuyaayi-chelebelagaum ab daud rahachal prapanch kaa jivan-rath
 Where was the lost gandhi-path? The father was like a mountain
 All the rivers went by saying 'vasudha hi kutumb', how many families were searching for shelter, Ram Bhagat in Becharloktantra
 kahaan kho gaya gandhi-path ?gandhi se zyada miltibadbolon ko yahaan footejagandhi bane hue hai kevallokatantr kii brands imagejagah-jagah dikhti he basnaam-pattica gandhi-path
 Where was the lost gandhi-path? chunaav ke pehle antim bajet satr main alji tejendra khanna ke abhibhaashan menshila dikshitsarkaar ke chunavi taiyaari kii jhalak mili
 LG Nesarkar's achievements in the face of opposition's talk
 lekin un muddon ko nahin chuaa jisase dilli kii janata nijaat paanaa chaahati he
 The address did not mention either the Basant Vihar gang rape, the problem of non-admission of admission, nor the increased electricity rates
 sawaal ye bhi he ki jab sarkaar phaayde main he to phir janata ghate main kyon he
 Delhi is now World Class City
 dilli main mahangaai dar sabase kam he
 895 irregular colonies were regularized
 8 lakh chaatro ko mili aarthik sahaayta
 15 hundred crores will be spent on roads ye kuch aisi uplabdhiyaan hai jinka bakhaan bajet satr ke shuruyaat main alji ne kiya
 LG said that the government has changed the picture of Delhi in the last 15 years
 dilli na sirf international shahar ban chukaa he balki buniyadi suvidhaon main bhi jarbadast sudhaar hua he
 His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor says that the government is going to spend 150 million on the roads next year
 iske alaava 625 nae lo floor basen bhi kharidne ja rahi he
 After lg's address, the Chief Minister himself left no stone unturned in counting his government's achievements
 unka to yahaan tak kahana tha ki kya aapane pehle kabhi aisi dilli dekhi he
 Now the question is that when the Delhi government has saved 30 thousand crores from privatization of electricity, then what benefit did the common man get
 vipaksh ne to puure abhibhaashan par sawaal uthaaya
 Obviously, lg's address gave a glimpse of the government's election preparedness, although the question is when the government is in profit which is why the public is in deficit

 The impact of the departure of the Congress government from the Center has been clearly seen in the development projects of Amethi, the constituency of Rahul Gandhi
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke sansadeey kshetra uttar pradesh ke amethi se pehle food park kii pariyojna chali gai or ab paper mil bhi jaataa hua dikh rahaa he
 Actually, there is a proposal to set up a paper mill in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra at a cost of Rs 3,650 crore

 Earlier this paper mill was to start in Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi
 rahul gandhi ke kshetra amethi main iske liye jagadishpur kaa chayan bhi kar liya gaya tha
 But Ratnagiri has been chosen after the demand of Anant Geet to set up this mill in Maharashtra
 mana ja rahaa he ki is pariyojna se 900 logon ko rojgaar milegaa
 Before the paper mill, the government also rejected the proposal to set up a mega food park in Jagdishpur
 tab loksabhaa main rahul gandhi neshktimaan food parkka masalaa bhi uthaaya tha or modi sarkaar par raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana se kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 However, in response to the allegations, the Central Government said that the Petroleum Ministry in the UPA government itself had refused to supply gas to Amethi at concessional rates and for this reason the Mega Food Park in Amethi could not be started

 What were those days too
 
 
 bachapan ke
 
 
 We all keep the stories of our childhood growing up like this
 apana bachapan saath lekar ghoomte hai chaahe duniya ke kisi bhi hisse main kyon naa rahen
 a bundle of memories is always together
 jeb kharch ke liye mili paise to kab ke khatm ho chuke hote hai
 But that capital of memories always remains in this bank
 malaysia main rah raheen lekhika manisha shri kii kitaab jindagi kii gullak bhi yaadon kaa ek aisa hi kolaj he
 There are clippings of life
 
 
 rang birangi to kabhi sochane ke liye majaboor karne vaali
 What is the purpose of the writer? wo likhane ke bahaane khud ko jeeta he or agar padhane vaala in yaadon main apana aks talashne lage to yakeenan lekhak kii kamyaabi he
 In this context, the piggyback of Manisha Shri's life is definitely said in the ears secretly without any noise
 yaadon ke is guladaste main manisha ne prayog karne kaa jokhim liya he
 Sometimes the poem, sometimes the story, sometimes it has tried to speak as a page of the diary
 is lihaaj se unki kitaab ek saraahneey koshish he
 Writing the simplest is the most complex work in the world
 lekin kitaab padhane se ye ahsaas hota he ki manisha ne vaaki is jatilta kaa nirvaah badi saralata se kiya he
 If the story of the river comes in the form of poetry, then she keeps her point on the issue like dowry
 isamen maa kaa dard bhi he or beti kii pidaa bhi
 Being a woman is the test of the discrimination that one has to bear, then there is also a sweet feeling of a sane world
 yaadon ke is pitare main kabhi saheli ke jariye baat kahi gai he to kabhi kisi mudde ke bahaane
 But everywhere the writer's flirtation has reached a conclusion
 thompane kii koshish nahin he
 But a discussion has definitely emerged
 jo sughad he kai baar usamen shilp kaa wo saundarya ubhar kar nahin aata jo dekhakar hi hamen uski khubsuurati kaa ahsaas kara de
 Sometimes the idols are more enjoyable
 manisha shri kii kitaab main ye angadhata kai baar jhalkati he
 But this bliss of nonchalance is the specialty of this book
 lekhika kii ye pehali kitaab he
 The writing style through which he has tried is certainly commendable

 (from input language) chunaavon main kaam se zyada ganit yani jati or dharm ke sameekaran or teble par jeet kii ranneeti, poster main naare, netaaon kii sabhaayen, kahaan or kitni
 Not only in which way the leader will speak
 kya bolegaa, kya pehnegaa kis rang kaa pehnegaa
 All these days electoral strategists are deciding
 bade-bade netaaon kii jeet kii jeet ke liye ek puri team kai pahaluon par vichaar karti he
 It is said that such strategists have helped in covering the distance of 7 RCR from Narendra Modi's Chief Minister's residence in Gujarat
 yah ranneetikaar yah bhi tay karte hai ki netaa kii soshal cites par profile ho
 The same experts decide what will go on that profile
 jarurat padi to yah log folover se lekar likes tak kharid kar soshal cites ke jariye bhram paidaa karte hai yaa phir kahen ki party ke prati ruukh modane kaa kaam karte hai
 And in today's era of technology, such people are also succeeding
 desh main aajkal sabase zyada agar kisi chunavi ranneetikaar kii charchaa ho rahi he to vah hai prashanth kishor
 He is said to have contributed a lot to reach Prime Minister Narendra Modi to such heights
 iske baad vah kisi baat se naaraaz ho gaye or fidd bihar ke chunaavon se pehle kishor ne nitish kumaar kaa daaman pakadaa or jediu ke liye ranneeti banaai
 In Bihar, JDU had already broken ties with BJP and then formed an alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki narendra modi kii lahar ke baavjood bijepi bihar main buree tarah haar gai or jediu-argedy kaa gathbandhan satta main lautaa
 However, before the elections, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's statement on reservation also caused this drastic defeat
 bihar main bijepi ko satta se dur rakhane ke baad congress party ne prashanth kishor kii sevaaon ke liye sampark kiya or uttar pradesh main lagbhag haashie par pahunch gai congress party ko satta main laane ke liye prashanth kishor jijaan se lag gaye
 Therefore, for the Congress party as well as for the electoral strategists this time the assembly elections are nothing less than a test
 kaha jaataa he ki prashanth kishor ke kehane par hi rahul gandhi pehle uttar pradesh main akele dam par chunaav ladane kii baat karte aa rahe the
 He even denied any possibility of an alliance
 vaise rahul gandhi ne jab se sakriy raajnneeti main akele aage badhane kaa kaam shuru kiya tab se vah party ke liye bhi ekala chalo kii ranneeti par kaam karne lage the
 He believed that the party could not be strengthened by alliance
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2009 ke aam chunaav main lalu prasad yadav kii argedy se gathbandhan nahin karne kaa charchit faisla bhi rahul ne hi liya tha
 He was also talking about the Congress fighting alone in Uttar Pradesh's 2017 General Assembly
 is disha main kisaan yatra or khaat sabha kaa ek maheene kaa bada abhiyaan bhi chalaaya
 It is believed that Prashant Kishore also gave the remedy of Kisan Yatra and Khat Sabha
 kuch reporton ke anusaar yahaan tak kii party ke majboot karne ke liye akele chalane ke stand ko bhi prashanth kishor kii ranneeti ke taur par dekha gaya
 But for this election in Uttar Pradesh, the Chief Strategist of the party, Prashant Kishore, also told the Congress High Command not to improve the condition of the party without an alliance after the Khat meetings, Rahul's program in Lucknow and Sonia Gandhi's roadshow in Varanasi
 kaha jaataa he ki rahul gandhi phir bhi gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 But, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Prashant Kishore prepared Rahul Gandhi for this through Priyanka Gandhi
 yah to prashanth kishor bhi jaanate hai ki jo kamyaabi abhi tak mili vah ek haar se dhul jaaegi or yah sandesh chalaa jayega ki raajnneeti main sirf or sirf kaam bolta he, party kii chhavi bolti he, netaaon kaa aacharan bolta he, ranneeti kaaphi baad kii cheez he
 With this, Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has also confessed that coalition politics is the way to change the political fortunes of the Congress
 is hakeekat ke ahsaas kaa hi nateeja he ki rahul ko bhi aakhirkaar 14 saal pehle sonia gandhi kii gathbandhan kii dikhaai raah par lautnaa padaa he
 Sonia had then openly advocated coalition politics for the first time in the 'shimla Resolution' to rid the party of crisis
 2003 main sonia gandhi ne party ko sankat ke daur se nikaalane ke liye shimla shivi main pehali baar rashtriya str par congress ke bhi gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke liye taiyaar hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 At that time, the Congress had 114 mps in the Lok Sabha, which was its lowest number at that time
 magar 2004 ke aam chunaav main gathbandhan kii raah par chalane kaa sonia kaa faisla party kii kismat badalane main kaamyaab rahaa
 With the outside support of the Left parties, the Congress not only returned to power at the Center but also held office for ten years
 haalanki congress tab bhi uttarapradesh or bihar jaise apane puraane paramparaagat pradeshon main dhai dashak baad bhi chauthe number kii party se upar nahin aa saki
 The comments bihar kaa parinaam rahul gandhi ke saamne hai jab unhone gathbandhan ke chalate bihar main siton ke maamle main acha parinaam paaya
 However, this time Akhilesh Yadav has also accepted that this type of strategy helps in the victory of the party
 lakhanu main kai exparts kii team unke is kaary main lagi hui he
 In the last election, strategists such as Satish Mishra for bsp's social engineering were considered as the warriors of the election summer
 lekin 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sari ranneeti dhari kii dhari rah gai thi
 This time it will be interesting to see how useful the understanding of Congress and Samajwadi Party strategists is
 or aaj ke takanic ke yug main philhal aise log kaamyaab bhi ho rahe hai
 The most talked about electoral strategist in the country these days is Prashant Kishore
 kaha jaataa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko itani oochaainyon tak pahunchane main unhone kaaphi yogadan diya
 After this he became angry with anything and before the Bihar elections, Kishore caught Nitish Kumar and made a strategy for JDU
 bihar main jediu ne bijepi ne pehle hi naata tod liya tha or phir unhone lalu prasad yadav kii argedy se gathbandhan karaayaa
 There is no doubt that despite the Narendra Modi wave, the BJP lost badly in Bihar and the JDU-RJD alliance returned to power
 vaise chunaavon se pehle aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat kaa aarakshan par diya bayaan bhi is karaari haar kaa kaaran bana tha
 After keeping the BJP away from power in Bihar, the Congress Party approached Prashant Kishore for services and joined the Prashant Kishore Jijan to bring the Congress Party which was almost marginalized in Uttar Pradesh
 isliye congress party ke saath-saath is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav chunavi ranneetikaron ke liye bhi ek imtihaan se kam nahin he
 It is said that at the behest of Prashant Kishore, Rahul Gandhi had earlier been talking about contesting elections on his own in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan tak kii gathbandhan kii kisi sambhaavna se vah inkaar kar rahe the
 By the time, Rahul Gandhi started working on the strategy of Ekla Chalo for the party since he started working alone in active politics
 unka maananaa tha ki gathbandhan ke sahare party ko majboot nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 This is the reason why in the general elections of 2009 Lalu Prasad Yadav's famous decision not to tie up with RJD was also taken by Rahul
 uttarapradesh ke 2017 ke chunavi mahaasangram main bhi pehle vah congress ke akele ladane kii baat kah rahe the
 In this direction, a month-long campaign of Kisan Yatra and Khat Sabha was also carried out
 mana jaataa he ki kisaan yatra or khaat sabha kaa upaay bhi janaadhar badhaane ke liye prashanth kishor ne hi diya tha
 According to some reports, even standing alone to strengthen the party was seen as Prashant Kishore's strategy
 magar uttarapradesh main is chunaav ke liye party ke mukhya ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne khaat sabhaaon, lakhanu main rahul ke kaarykram or varanasi main sonia gandhi ke road sho ke baad congress haikaman ko gathbandhan ke bina party kii haalat nahin sudharne kii hakeekat bhi bataa di
 It is said that Rahul Gandhi was still not ready for the alliance
 kintu, gulam nabi aaazaad or prashanth kishor ne priyanka gandhi ke jariye rahul gandhi ko iske liye taiyaar kiya
 Even Prashant Kishore knows that the success so far will be washed away by a defeat and the message will go that in politics speaks only and only, speaks the image of the party, speaks the conduct of the leaders, the strategy is much later Is the thing
 isi ke saath congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi yah kabool kar liya he ki gathbandhan kii raajnneeti hi congress kii siyaasi takadir badalane kaa rasta he
 The realization of this reality is that Rahul too has finally had to return to the visible path of Sonia Gandhi's alliance 14 years ago
 sonia ne tab party ko sankat ke daur se nikaalane ke liye ‘shimla sankalp’ main pehali baar gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kii khulkar vakaalat kii thi
 In 2003, Sonia Gandhi announced that for the first time at the Shimla camp, the Congress was also ready for coalition politics to take the party out of the crisis
 tab loksabhaa main congress ke 114 saansad the jo us vakt uski sabase kam sankhya thi
 But Sonia's decision to follow the coalition's path in the 2004 general election managed to change the party's fortunes
 vamadalon ke bahari samarthan se congress na keval kendra kii satta main lauti balki das saal tak kabiz rahi
 However, even after two and a half decades in its old traditional states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the Congress could not rise above the number four party
 tippaniyan The result of Bihar is in front of Rahul Gandhi when he got a good result in the seats in Bihar due to the alliance
 vaise is baar akhilesh yadav ne bhi yah maan liya he ki is prakaar kii ranneeti party kii jeet main sahaayak hoti he
 a team of many experts in Lucknow is engaged in this task
 pichley chunaav main basapa ke soshal ejineering ke liye satish mishra jaise ranneetikaron ko chunavi samar kaa yoddha mana gaya tha
 But in the 2012 assembly elections, the whole strategy was lost
 is baar congress or samaajawaadee party ke ranneetikaron kii samaj kitna kaam aati he yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 After keeping the BJP away from power in Bihar, the Congress Party approached Prashant Kishore for services and joined the Prashant Kishore Jijan to bring the Congress Party which was almost marginalized in Uttar Pradesh

 Some people on social media are criticizing the award of Bharat Ratna to Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya merely because he was a Brahmin
 ab tak mahaamanaa or atal bihari vaajapeyi sahit 45 logon ko bharat ratna se nawaaza ja chukaa he, or ho saktaa he, unamem adhiktar brahman athwa ucch jati ke hi hon, lekin yaad rakhana chahie ki jaateey or dharmik kattarta se lipati soch kisi ke bhi achche kaamon par pardaa daal sakati he
 i have not read much about Madan Mohan Malaviya, but a story was told by my teacher about the struggle to build BHU when he was going from place to place to collect donations from people
 
 
 usee kram main ek raja ke paas gaye
 
 
 Madan Mohan Malaviya said, Maharaj, i am building a big educational institute in Benaras, where thousands of children will get education
 
 
 uske liye aapke paas daan ke liye aayaa hum
 
 
 The king saw the poor condition of Madan Mohan Malaviya from top to bottom and said, you will build an educational institution
 
 
 pehle apni haalat to sudhaar le
 
 
 i have no money, what will my shoe take? 
 
 or pandit ji juuta hi lekar chale aae
 
 
 Just as Jyotiba Phule worked for the upliftment of women, Madan Mohan Malaviya worked in the field of education, where more than 35,000 students of every caste and religion are pursuing high-level education
 yahi ve log hai, jinhone shiksha kaa chiraag roshan kar jatvaad or dharmik kattarta mitaane kii koshish kii thi
 
 
 Many have done good work in the society
 
 
 sar saiyad ahamed ne bhi, jinhone aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay kii neenv rakhi
 Even thousands of Seths, who donated space and money for colleges and hospitals, but blaming anyone on the basis of caste or religion is not appropriate
 
 
 madan mohan malviya ne yah sochakar banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay kii neenv nahin rakhi thi ki unhen bharat ratna se sammanit kiya jayega
 
 
 Maybe, some people accuse me that i am obsessed with Brahminical thinking, but i do not see the positive work happening in the society from the point of view of any caste and religion
 
 
 unke bare main ani besent ne kaha tha ki vah bharat kii ekta kii murti hai
 
 
 At the Lahore session of the Congress in 1909, he was the main dialogue between the soft and the hot party
 teen baar congress ke adhyaksh rah chuke madan mohan malviya kii jindagi ko dobaaraa padhane kaa isse acha mauka koi or nahin ho saktaa he
 
 
 However, historian Ramchandra Guha also said that there is no justification for awarding Bharat Ratna to Madan Mohan Malaviya
 
 
 is par charchaa ho sakati he ki bharat ratna jinda rahane par diya jaae yaa mritkon ko bhi, lekin madan mohan malviya ke saamaajik yogadan ko kamatar aankna, or vah bhi is daur main, jahaan zyaadaatar log apane parivaar ko aage badhaane, paison, chapalusee or nafrat kii raajnneetik daldal main dabe hon
 
 
 Today, those who are associating their Bharat Ratna with caste, they should not forget the movement of Dalits of Madan Mohan Malaviya for entry into temples
 
 
 madan mohan malviya hi vah shaks the, jinhone bharat ke vibhaajan kii shart par swatantraaa lene kaa virodh kiya tha
 
 
 When Sachin Tendulkar and VV Giri can get Bharat Ratna, criticizing Madan Mohan Malaviya for simply being a Brahmin is like turning away from history
 
 
 ramdhaari singh dinakar kii rachana he, "samar shesh he, nahin paap kaa bhaagi keval vyaghr
