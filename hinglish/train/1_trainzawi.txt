 com / k21ikvozvg pune test kii jeet ke baad australia kii team majboot manobal ke saath shanivaar se prarambh hone ja rahe bengaluru test main utregi
 In Pune, the Kangaroo team, performing brilliantly in both the batting and bowling areas, not only defeated India on the same ground but also broke the order of being unbeatable for 19 consecutive matches
 mehmaan team kii ballebaaji kaa daaromadar bahut kuch captain steve smith (steve Smith) or baayen haath ke openar david warner par he
 Smith scored a century in the Pune Test, showing his ability to stay on Indian wickets
 is sangharmpurn pari kii badaulat unhone apane ballebaajon ko yah bataane kii koshish kii he ki drudh ichhashakti ke bal par spin gendon ke madadgaar maane jane vaale bhartiya viketon par bhi ran banaae ja sakate hai
 The interesting thing is that Smith started his career as a leg-spinner and he came down to bat at number eight
 baad main unhone apni ballebaaji main sudhaar laate hue na sirf visheshgy ballebaaj ke taur par australian team main sthaan banaaya balki iske captain bhi bane
 The comments bengaluru test main australian captain ek or record apane naam kar sakate hai
 If Smith managed to score 112 runs at the Chinaswamy Stadium, then the Test would touch 5000 runs in cricket
 smith jis andaaj main batting kar rahe hai, use dekhte hue aisa lag rahaa he ki bengaluru test main hi ve is aankade ko chhu lenge
 The Indian team will try to get Smith out early and not only put pressure on the Australian team but also deprive him of this record in Bengaluru
 iske liye team india ke khilaadiyon ko kaich drop karne kii apane kamajori ko dur karnaa hoga
 Smith gave three lives to Indian fielders in Pune
 ek baar murali vijay or do baar sthanapann khilaadi abhinav mukund ne australia team ke captain kaa kaich choda
 Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has also said that if Indian fielders drop catches again, Smith can add to Team India's woes by scoring a century
 vaise bhi smith kaa bhartiya team ke khilaaf record shandaar rahaa he
 Smith has played 60 of the 51 Tests so far
 34 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se 4888 ran banaae hai jisamen 18 shatak shaamil hai
 During this period, 215 runs have been the highest score by the Australian captain
 test maichon ke alaava vanade main bhi smith kaamyaab hai
 He 43 in 95 odis
 67 ke ausat se 3101 ran bana chuke hai jisamen aath shatak shaamil hai
 The Australian captain can name another record in the Bengaluru Test
 chinnaswami stadium main agar smith 112 ran banane main kaamyaab rahe to test cricket main 5000 ran ke aankade ko chhu lenge
 Looking at the manner in which Smith is batting, it seems that he will touch this figure in the Bengaluru test itself
 bhartiya team kii koshish hogi ki vah smith ko jald out kar na sirf australian team par dabaav banaae balki bengaluru main unhen yah record banane se vanchit kare
 For this, the players of Team India will have to overcome their weakness to drop the catch
 pune main bhartiya fielderon ne smith ko teen jeevandaan die
 Once Murali Vijay and twice substitute Abhinav Mukund missed the Australian team captain
 australia ke purv captain maaikel clark ne bhi kaha he ki yadi bhartiya fielderon ne phir se kaich drop kiye to smith shatak banaakar team india kii mushkilon main ijapha kar sakate hai
 Anyway, Smith's record against the Indian team has been excellent
 ab tak 51 test khel chuke smith ne 60
 He has scored 4888 runs at an impressive average of 34 which includes 18 centuries
 is dauraan 215 ran australian captain kaa sarvocch score rahaa he
 Apart from Test matches, Smith is also successful in odis
 ve 95 vanade maichon main 43
 Has scored 3101 runs at an average of 67 which includes eight centuries
 vaise bhi smith kaa bhartiya team ke khilaaf record shandaar rahaa he
 Smith has played 60 of the 51 Tests so far
 34 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se 4888 ran banaae hai jisamen 18 shatak shaamil hai
 During this period, 215 runs have been the highest score by the Australian captain
 test maichon ke alaava vanade main bhi smith kaamyaab hai
 He 43 in 95 odis
 67 ke ausat se 3101 ran bana chuke hai jisamen aath shatak shaamil hai

 '' aasthaa ko lekar bhaajapa kaa yah sankalp apni sthapana (1980) ke baad pehali baar uttar bharat (ayodhya) se aage badhkar dakshin bharat (sabarimala) main pahunch gaya he
 In fact, the saffron brigade had prepared the plans for its expansion in the south at the BJP National Executive meeting in Odisha in April 2017, but the Supreme Court's Sabarimala decision gave it another "ayodhya" in the south on its political chalk
 Gave a chance to create

 According to sources, 680 of these workers were sent to Kerala
 baithak ke baad agle din amit shah ne "mishan kerala'' kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya
 Under Mission Kerala, it was decided that a 41-day Ramraj Rath Yatra would be started from Ayodhya to Rameswaram on August Shivaratri (february 13, 2018)
 6,000 kimi kii yah yatra 6 rajyon—uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, karnataka, kerala or tamilnadu se gujri jiske tahat 224 loksabhaa siten aati hai
 Before the Yatra was completed in Rameswaram, people of BJP, RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad gave a grand welcome to the yatra in Thiruvananthapuram
 sutron ke mutabik, bhaajapa yah maanakar chal rahi thi ki kerala sarkaar yatra ko rokane kii koshish karegi or phir bhaajapa ko mudda mil jayega lekin aisa nahin hua to yojana dhari rah gai
 But the party kept on searching for a fair chance
 aakhirkaar bhaajapa or iske pitru sanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ko 28 sitambar ko vah avasar haath laga jisase use kerala main ek or "ayodhya'' gande kaa aastharupi aujaar mil gaya
 The Supreme Court on 28 September allowed the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple
 kerala kii vammorcha sarkaar ne supreme court ke aadesh ko lagu karne kaa elaan kiya to bhaajapa or aresas or sangh ke aanushanbik sanghathan virodh main utar gaye
 After the verdict, the leaders of the Sangh Parivar and BJP did not speak against the decision of the Supreme Court for four weeks, but they kept saying that they would not allow women of all age groups to enter the Sabarimala temple
 iske baavjood sabarimala ko ayodhya ke ram mandir jaisaa siyaasi painaapan nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 State BJP president Sreedharan Pillai says, "we accept the decision of the Supreme Court but the issue is not of law but of faith
" '' jab unase poocha gaya ki centre sarkaar adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf adhyadesh kyon nahin laa rahi he to unhone kaha, "aage kii ranneeti kendriya netritv tay karegaa
 We are now demanding from the Left Front government of the state that the state government itself bring the ordinance as the Tamil Nadu government had brought the ordinance regarding Jallikattu
 ''bhaajapa do kadam aage or ek kadam peeche kii ranneeti par tab tak chalati rahi jab tak amit shah ne khud kerala kaa rukh nahin kiya
 On 27 October in Coonoor, Amit Shah tried to sharpen the Sabarimala episode so that Hindu voters in Kerala, not only in Kerala, but in the name of faith, could be favored by the BJP
 kunoor main amit shah ne kaha, "kerala kii janata desh ke mahaan dharm, samskruti, aasthaa or paramparaon kii raksha ke liye bhaajapa kaa samarthan kare
 "shah did not stop here
" unhone aasthaa ke mudde par hindu voton ke dhruvikaran ko lakshya main rakhte hue yahaan tak kaha ki "kerala ke mukhyamantri pi
 Vijayan will implement Ajan's decision on Mike in Supreme Court mosques! Do they have the courage to do so? jab vijayan aisa nahin kar sakate to phir bhagwaan ayappa ke bhakton par atyaachaar kyon kar rahe hai
 "shah did not even stop to say that there are many decisions of the court which have not been implemented till date, then why the devotees of Lord Ayyappa are being tortured
" shah ne sangh or bhaajapa ke un kaaryakartaaon ko bhi shradhanjali di jinaki hatya kerala main pichley kuch saal main hui he
 The rest of the parties do not understand this strategy of the BJP, it is not so

 The Aam Aadmi is not taking the name of discord and ruckus within the party
 ab haalat yah he ki party ke andar sulagati chingaari khulkar saamne aa rahi he
 Controversy is seen on social media between Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas and Dilip Pandey
 dilli ke purv prabharee dilip pandeya ne kumaar vishwaas par sawaal khadey kar die
 Pandey wrote on Twitter, "bhaiya, you abuse Congressmen a lot, but say that you will not speak against Vasundhara in Rajasthan? Why so?" Actually, Kumar Vishwas had a meeting with the officials of the Rajasthan unit on June 10
 
 baithak main kumaar ne kaha tha ki rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main party apane mul siddhanton par lautegi
 Kumar directed his officials not to make personal comments on any leader, including BJP leader and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 kumaar ne apane netaaon ko nijee tippaniyon ke bajaay muddon par kendrit prachaar karne kii naseehat di thi
 Dilip Pandey questioned this soft attitude of Kumar towards BJP leaders
 dilip pandeyyane twit ke baad ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki kumaar vishwaas pathpradarshak hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been speaking out against the corruption of BJP and Congress
 lekin kumaar vishwaas kaa ye sandesh dena ki bijepi netaaon ke khilaaf nahin bolnaa he, kaaryakartao main sanshay paidaa karata he
 Pandey said that there was no conflict and estrangement with Kumar Vishwas nor was there any allegation against him
 ye sirf kaaryakartaaon main duvidha he, jise kumaar vishwaas ko dur karnaa chahie
 Pandey taunted that if the BJP played cricket, the Congress played Gulli Danda, it would not do
 pandeya ke is bayaan se jaahir hota he ki kumaar vishwaas ko lekar aam aadmi party ke andar sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Earlier, Amanatullah Khan had made serious allegations against Kumar Vishwas, after which he was also suspended from the party
 aise main ab dilip pandeya kaa sawaal uthaanaa saaf ishaara kar rahaa he ki party main jabardast khmebandi chal rahi he
 After the Amanatullah Khan controversy, Hekumar Vishwas was appointed as the in-charge of Rajasthan by the Aam Aadmi Party and in the recently held national executive meeting also indicated to contest the Rajasthan assembly elections
 jiske baad kumaar vishwaas rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar sakriy ho gaye the
 Vishwas had called a meeting of all Rajasthan office bearers in Delhi, saying in two words that there would be no photograph of any big leader in Rajasthan
 ishaara saaf tha ki rajasthan main arvind kejariwal kii bhi tasviir istemaal nahin kii jaaegi
 Not only this, Vishwas had said that the party unit in Rajasthan would return to the original principles
 jiskaa saaf ishaara aam aadmi party ke netritv par tha
 Vishwas had instructed the leaders that no leader, whether it is Vasundhara Raje, will be given any personal comments against them
 kumaar ne chehre par kendrit raajnneeti na karne kii baat bhi kahi thi
 There is still about a year and a half left in the Rajasthan assembly elections
 uske pehle hi 'aap' main khulkar kalah saamne aane lagi he
 In such a situation, questions are being raised whether the Aam Aadmi Party does not have "faith" in Kumar? england ke purv captain paul collingwood ne england team ko tii-20 world cap jeetne kaa majboot daavedaar bataaya he
 Collingwood said that England's batting is excellent at the moment and these are good signs for the team
 england kii ballebaaji kramengland ke paas eon morgan, ben stokes, jose butler, elex helles, jo root, sam billing, jesan roy or james vince jaise ballebaaj hai or aise main coach trevor belis bhi maanate hai ki unki team bharat main is saptaah shuru ho rahe vishwa cap main vijeta banakar saamne aa sakati he
 Fielding of the team, Fantastic Collingwood said that with such players, a team is expected to win big events

 These things give strength to any team

 But the working father could not arrange such expenses even in the dream

 The Ayushman scheme is now a boon for the disheartened Ramamilan for not being able to treat the child

 They say that my child is being treated because of the Prime Minister
 jabaki cardiology vibhaag ke head rakesh verma kaa kahana he ki hamaare aspataal ke liye yah ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa pehla marij he
 We have admitted the child
 ab pehle isaki jaanch hogi or uske baad ilaaj hoga

 Vishal's sister Bharti Yadav also went to give his sister's wedding card to Nitish's house, meaning both families knew each other
 court ne ye bhi kaha ki 'hatya kaa kaaran shaadi ke dauraan donon kaa saath main naachna or isse donon bhaiyon kaa hatya kaa shadyantra rachana tha, lekin ye hatya jaghanyatam aparaadh nahin tha
 ' court ne maut kii sajaa se inkaar karne ke saath hi ye bhi kaha tha ki 'hatya ke samay donon bhai bahut jawan the, isliye taumr kii bhi sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 'delhi High Court sentenced Vikas and Vishal Yadav to 30 years of imprisonment
 donon ne bhi hoicourt ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 On this argument of Salve, the Supreme Court said that it does not appear that there was honor killing in this case
 vishaal kii bahan bharti yadav apni bahan kii shaadi kaa card bhi nitish ke ghar dene gayi thi, jiskaa matlab donon parivaar ek duusare ko jaanate the
 The court also said that the reason for the murder was the conspiracy between the two to dance together during the marriage and the murder of the two brothers from it, but this murder was not a heinous crime
 ' Apart from denying capital punishment, the court had also said that 'both brothers were very young at the time of murder, so even Taumra cannot be punished
 ' dilli hoicourt ne vikaas or vishaal yadav ko 30 saal kii kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Both have also challenged the High Court's decision in the Supreme Court
 court ne maut kii sajaa se inkaar karne ke saath hi ye bhi kaha tha ki 'hatya ke samay donon bhai bahut jawan the, isliye taumr kii bhi sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 'delhi High Court sentenced Vikas and Vishal Yadav to 30 years of imprisonment
 donon ne bhi hoicourt ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he

 Accusing the ruling NDA coalition in Bihar of false propaganda for 'bihar Shining', Congress National Secretary Rahul Gandhi said that the Center gave crores of rupees to the state for the development of the state but the work here does not appear on the ground
 rajya main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan congressi ummidavaaron ke paksh main chunaav prachaar karne yahaan aae rahul ne kaha ki vartmaan main centre main samprag kii sarkaar he, varsh 2004 main jab unki party ne chunaav ladaa tha to desh kii janata se vaada kiya tha ki centre main agar congress evam samprag kii sarkaar banegi to vah aam aadmi, garibon, pichhadon, daliton or adivaasiyon kii sarkaar hogi
 He also addressed public meetings at Ramnagar in West Champaran district and Kuchayakot in Gopalganj
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki varsh 2004 main congress ke khilaaf rajg ne chunaav ladaa tha or us samay ‘india shining yani chamakta hua hindustan’ kaa naaraa diya tha or unke kehane kaa taatpary yah tha hindustan chamak rahaa he par ukt chunaav main desh kii janata ne unako bataa diya ki kisaanon, pichhadon, daliton or adivaasiyon kaa hindustan chamak nahin rahaa he or unhone use baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 He said that the people of the previous NDA government at the Center did not go out among the people and see the situation and without listening to them, gave the slogan while sitting in their homes
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne kaha ki varsh 2009 ke chunaav main bhi congress ne centre main aam aadmi kii sarkaar banane kii baat kahi thi
 The Congress raised the issue of poverty, backwardness, dalits and tribals during the said election, but the NDA left all these and talked about other issues including terrorism
 rahul ne kaha ki desh kii janata ne phir se 2009 main bhi rajg ko dikhaa diya ki hamen ek aisi sarkaar chahie jo aam aadmi, garibon evam pichhadon ke bare main soche or desh ko pragati ke path par le ja sake or sabko saath lekar chale
 The Congress General Secretary said that when the Congress came to power in the Center in the year 2004, the world's largest employment program called NREGA, nowadays known as MNREGA, was started and guaranteed 100 days of employment to the poor unemployed
 Arrangements have been made
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava 60 hajaar karod rupee ke kisaanon ke rin maaf kar bank ke daravaaje phir se kisaanon ke liye khol die gaye
 Rahul said that the previous Congress government at the Center got the tribals back their land and in addition passed the Right to Education Act and is talking about the right to food in times to come
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2004 main congress ke centre main sattashin hone par desh main pragati aayi or hindustan bahut teji aage badhane laga
 Talking about the lack of funds, Rahul said that today any state can send any amount needed by the central government
 rahul ne udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki centre kii pichhali rajg sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan 50 hajaar karod rupee bihar ko die gaye par centre kii pichhali samprag sarkaar ne apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan is pradesh ko ek lakh crores rupee die par dukh kii baat yah he ki ukt raashi janata tak nahin pahunchi
 Rahul Gandhi said that if we talk about the Indira Awas Yojana of the Center, then Bihar got the maximum amount under it, but corruption is prevalent in it and it is being given to the rich and not to the poor
 unhone kaha ki bihar main manaregaa ke tahat agar rojgaar kii baat karen to garib logon ko iske tahat sau dinon kaa rojgaar milanaa to dur 30 din kaa bhi rojgaar nahin mil paata
 Rahul said that if we talk about electrification in Bihar, then there are thousands of villages which do not have electricity today, whereas the Center has given funds to the state government for this and electricity has to be provided in every village under the Central Rural Electrification Scheme
 unhone kaha ki chunaav kaa samay aate dekh pradesh kii vartmaan rajg sarkaar ekbar phir ‘bihar shining’ kii baat kar rahi he or agar aisa he to pradesh main log bijli evam pani ke liye kyon taras rahe hai or bihar ke log rojgaar ke liye mumbai, punjab, haryana evam dilli sahit desh ke anya bhaagon main jane ke liye baadhya kyon hai
 Rahul accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of going along with the ideology of BJP and other NDA constituents, saying that they are doing this to confuse people
 unhone kaha ki nitish jahaan ek taraf chunaav kaa samay aane par bhaajapa netaa narendra modi sahit anya ko bihar nahin aane dene kii baat karte hai, vahiin unke sahyogi dal shivasena pramukh bala sahib thakare bihar vaasiyon ko maharashtra se bhagaate hai
 Rahul said that when there was a riot in Gujarat, why did Nitish not resign from the post of Union Minister opposing him
 bihar ke vikaas ke liye or samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko ekasaath lekar chalane ke liye logon se congress ko vot dene kii apil karte hue rahul ne kaha ki unki party ne kabhi bhi desh kii akhandta ke liye khatra bani vichaardhaaraon ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya

 Union Home Secretary GK Pillai said on Friday that the number of security forces deployed in Jammu and Kashmir will be cut by 25 percent
 pillai ne kaha, ‘sarkaar jammu-kashmir main tainaat surakshabalon kii sankhya main 25 pratishat tak katautee kaa iraadaa kar rahi he
 'he said that we have already reduced the number of security forces in Srinagar as the security force should be at least in the populated areas
 sthaneey police ko hi halaat se nipatane dena chahie
 We have taken this step as a way to restore confidence
 ham chaahate hai ki sabhi bal keval simaaon par tainaat hon taaki ghuspaith roki ja sake
 He said that more bunkers would be removed from Srinagar
 ullekhneey he ki pillai ne kuch din pehle hi sanket diya tha ki jammu-kashmir ke jin ilaakon main lambey samay tak shanti kaayam rahati he, vahaan surakshabalon kii sankhya kam kii jaaegi
 Pillai said that the interlocutors appointed by the central government have been asked to submit their final proposals to the government by April

 The campaigning for the ninth and final phase of Lok Sabha elections 2014 came to an end on Saturday and soon after, bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi met top RSS leaders including Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat
 iske thik ek din baad bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne bhi dilli sangh mukhyalay par hajiri lagaai
 The meeting between BJP President Rajnath Singh and RSS leaders at the Sangh office in Delhi lasted for about two hours
 samajha jaataa he ki rajnath ne unase chunaav pashchaat aage kii ranneeti par charchaa kii
 It is believed that Rajnath Singh discussed the party's strategy and counting of votes on 16 May in view of the last phase of voting
 bhaiyyaji joshi va suresh soni bhi the maujuudarajanath singh kii sangh ke netaa bhaiyyaji joshi or suresh soni ke saath kareeb 2 ghante tak chali is baithak main anuraag thakur bhi unke saath maujuud rahe
 Sources said that the three leaders met at the RSS office in Jhandewalan and discussed the post-election situation
 baad main sangh ne jaankaree di ki is baithak main sangh netaaon ko prachaar main sahyog ke liye dhanyavad diya gaya
 Dattatreya Hoshabale said, 'modi had come to narrate the experiences of his election campaign
 thik usee tarah rajnath bhi aaye the
 'modi had met the RSS chief Narendra Modi, bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi had met Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday after the election campaign was over
 uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar kar rahe modi ne nau charnon ke liye chunaav prachaar samaapt hone ke baad dilli lautne ke baad purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se bhent kii
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat had tweeted on Saturday, 'took Atalji's blessing after addressing the last rally in the election campaign
 abhiyaan shuru karne se pehle bhi unase milane gaya tha
 Meeting him has always been special
 ’gauratlab he ki antim charan ke tahat somvaar ko matdaan hona he jisamen varansi seat bhi shaamil he jahaan se modi chunaav lard rahe hai
 The surprising thing is that Rajnath Singh came to thank in the absence of the Sangh chief
 ye raajnneeti kaa nitigat bayaan he lekin atakalein kuch or hi lagaai ja rahi hai
 Whenever the Parliament session starts, the GST thing starts to get louder
 ab pesh hoga to ab paas hoga
 Hearing about GST, it was felt that this is a one-time solution to all the problems of India's tax system
 guds and sarvice tex bolte hai
 It is being touted as the biggest tax reform so far
 agar aisa he to jiesti ko lekar baton kaa dayera bhi vyapak hona chahie
 Government claims that it has reached very close to the consent and number to pass it and now no one can stop it from becoming law
 zarur yah ek jatil vishay he magar aazamaa kar dekhne main kya harz he
 Anyway, the finance minister says that economic integration of the country is going to happen with GST, now such a big activity is happening, then the country should also discuss
 abhi bharat main paidaa hone vaale kisi bhi maal par centre or rajya milakar kai prakaar ke tex lagaate hai
 Such as sales tax, excise, octroi, VAT etc
 inhen aap apratyaksh kar kehete hai
 Tax where the goods were produced, from where it was sold or made, there was a variety of octroi all the way and if you bought it then tax
 vyapaariyon kaarobaariyon ke liye kai vibhaagon or kaagazon ke jhanjhat kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 Businesses in many places were drowned and many places had to run
 jaise ghaziabad main mashin or mashinari part par rajya sarkaar 14
 Imposes 5 percent tax
 isi item par aas paas ke kuch rajya paanch se saat pratishat kaa tex lagaate hai
 This weakens its business in Ghaziabad as people move to other states for this work
 ab hamen yah nahin maaloom ki agar sabhi jagah ek dar se tex laga diya jaae to sabhi jagah mashinari kaa dhandha chamakegaa yaa kisi ek yaa do jagah par hi chamakegaa
 If GST is applicable, tax has to be paid once and at the same place
 isse pehle waite or sarvice tex aayaa tha tab bhi unhen lekar khub sapane dikhaaye gaye the
 But now everyone is coming with a GST and dreams have become one
 tex kii ugaahi bad jaaegi or bharat kii jidipi bhi dashamalav nau se dedh se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The reasoning behind GDP growth is that there is no record of innumerable business at this time, hence the correct estimation of GDP is not done
 jiesti se jude jaankaar kehete hai ki jo bhi sevaayen dete hai chaahe ve vyapaaree hai yaa udyogpati agar unka salanaa turnover das lakh se adhik he to ritern file karnaa padegaa
 This will bring maximum real data to the government and increase the collection of taxes
 lekin jo jiesti aa rahaa he kya wo vaaki ek dar or ek prakaar kii kar pranali he
 Are the same taxes applicable everywhere after the implementation of GST? agar aisa he to isaki suchi main ye teen alag alag naam kya kehete hai
 Center GST, State GST, Inter State GST
 vitt mantri ne ise aarthik ekikaran kaha he to phir teen prakaar kii jiesti kyon hai
 Why is there not a type
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki teen prakaar kii jiesti ke kaaran ab vyapaaree kaa assesament bhi teen jagahon par dekha jayega
 It will continue as it was before
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ek hi ritern file kerani hogi lekin uski jaanch kam se kam do yaa teen adhikari centre yaa rajya ke str par karenge
 Will the system be the same somewhere? kya vaaki vibhaagon ke chakkar lagane se mukti mil jaaegi
 GST will be different on gold, silver and luxury
 aam janata se judi chizon par jiesti alag hogi
 If the mess of rate remains in GST, then what is the benefit of GST
 akhabaaron main zyaadaatar lekh or bayanon ko padhate hue jiesti kii prashansa hi milti he
 He says that GST is better than the last
 ek paripakv arthvyavastha main har tarah ke kaarobaar kaa record to hona hi chahie
 Are most people of India ready for this? awwal to raajnneetik dalon ko hi manaane main itane saal lag gaye to logon ko bhi vakt dena hi hoga
 It would be difficult to trade off the record
 duniya ke 160 se adhik deshon main jiesti lagu he
 Not applicable in US
 arun kumaar ne economik and polytical vikali main kuch sawaal uthaaye hai
 It is being said that GST will increase the share of indirect taxes in our GDP
 apratyaksh kar badhane se mudrasphiti badhati he to chizon ke daam kaise kam ho jaaenge
 Arun Kumar says that prices of most things will go up
 jiesti kaa asangathit kshetra ke karabor par kya asar padane vaala he
 Will it really reduce or eliminate the hidden black money in our economy
 kya jiesti vaaki har marz kii dawa he
 Professor Prabhat Patnaik has expressed the possibility of the federal structure being weakened over GST
 sangheey dhaanche kaa matlab aap yun samajhiye ki centre or rajya apane aarthik faisle apni apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se karenge
 After GST, there will be nothing left for states to do about tax
 wo har chiz ke liye centre par nirbhar ho jaaenge
 But the Finance Minister claims that most states have agreed to GST
 sirf tamilnadu ko kuch aapattiyaan hai
 The comments sansad kaa monusan satr ho saktaa he jiesti ke kaaran aitihaasik ho jaae
 The constitution amendment is a bill
 rajyasabha main paas hone ke baad aadhe rajyon kii vidhansabha se bhi paas hona hoga
 The Finance Minister claims that this will increase India's GDP by two percent
 kya vaaki jiesti nahin hone ke kaaran hamaari jidipi 2 pratishat kam he
 Due to GST, on what basis are we hoping that the indirect tax base will increase
 kya bharat kii jidipi isliye kam he ki bahut saare kaarobaaron kii ginati nahin he
 If GST was meant to be a tax, then why were the states allowed to levy VAT and sales tax on petroleum
 centre sarkaar rajyon ko teen saal tak jo bhi rajasav nuksaan hoga uski bharpai karegi
 After that there will be no loss of revenue or any discussion about what the state will do or we do not understand among the common people
 jiesti council main teen chauthai se faisla hoga
 Politics is not sustainable in the country
 maujuuda daur par bhaajapa ko badhat ho sakati he lekin jiesti council main bhaajapa virdohi rajya ke liye kya sthiti itani aasaan hogi
 In the current system, there are conflicts between the Center and the state over the fund
 kahin aisa to nahin ki rajya kaa vitt mantri jiesti council ke daftar main hi baitha rahegaa
 Another question arises that when all taxes will be decided by the GST Council, what will the Finance Minister do in the states
 ham hindi ke darshakon ko in jatil vishyon se guzar kar dekhnaa chahie taaki jab sarkaar sansad main ise paas kar ise lekar bade bade daawey kare to ham bhi isaki upyogita or aitihaasikta ko samaj saken
 Right now, the Center and the state together impose many types of taxes on any goods originating in India
 jaise cells tex, excise, chungi, waite vagairah
 You call these indirect taxes
 jahaan maal paidaa hua vahaan tex, jahaan se bikne yaa banane gaya to raste bhar main naanaa prakaar kii chungi or aapane kharida to phir tex
 For businessmen, many departments and papers had to face the hassle
 kai jagahon ke bijness dub jate the or kai jagahon ke chal padate the
 Such as State Government 14 on Machine and Machinery Part in Ghaziabad
 5 pratishat tex lagaati he
 Some nearby states levy a tax of five to seven percent on this item
 jisase gajiabad main iskaa dhandha kamazor ho jaataa he kyonki log is kaam ke liye duusare rajyon main chale jate hai
 Now we do not know that if the tax is levied at one rate in every place, then the business of machinery will shine everywhere or at one or two places only
 jiesti lagu hoga to ek hi baar or ek hi jagah tex dena hoga
 Earlier, VAT and service tax had come, even then many dreams were shown about them
 lekin ab sabko milakar ek jiesti aa rahaa he to sapane bhi ek ho gaye hai
 Tax levies will increase and India's GDP will also increase from decimal nine to one and a half to two percent
 jidipi badhane ke peeche daleel yah di jaati he ki is vakt asankhya kaarobaar kaa koi record nahin he, lihaaza jidipi kaa sahi aankalan nahin ho paata he
 GST experts say that whatever services they provide, whether they are traders or industrialists, if their annual turnover is more than one million, then they will have to file returns
 isse sarkaar ke paas zyada se zyada vaastavik aankada aayega or karon kii vasuuli bhi bad jaaegi
 But the GST that is coming in is really a rate and a type of tax system
 kya vaaki jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad sabhi jagah samaan kar lagu honge
 If so, what are these three different names in its list? centre jiesti, state jiesti, inter state jiesti
 The Finance Minister has called it economic integration, so why are there three types of GST
 ek prakaar kii kyon nahin he
 Critics say that due to the three types of GST, now the merchant's assessment will also be seen in three places
 jaise pehle chal rahaa tha vaise hi ab bhi chalegaa
 Critics say that a single return has to be filed but it will be examined by at least two or three officials at the central or state level
 kahin vyavastha vahi to nahin rahegi
 Is it really liberating to visit the departments? sona, chaandi or vilasita par jiesti alag hogi
 GST will be different on things related to general public
 agar rate kaa jhanjhat jiesti main rahegaa to phir jiesti kaa kya phayda
 Most of the articles and statements in the newspapers are praised by GST
 unka kahana he ki jiesti antim rup se to behatar he
 In a mature economy, there should be a record of all types of business
 kya bharat ke zyaadaatar log iske liye taiyaar hai
 If it took so many years to convince only the political parties, people would have to give time
 record se baahar vyapaar kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 GST is applicable in more than 160 countries of the world
 america main nahin lagu he
 Arun Kumar has raised some questions in the Economic and Political Weekly
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki ji es tii ke kaaran hamaari jidipi main apratyaksh karon kaa hissaa bad jayega
 If inflation increases due to indirect tax increase, then how will the prices of things come down
 arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar chizon ke daam badhenge
 What impact will GST have on the unorganized sector? kya vaaki isse hamaari arthvyavastha main chhipe kaale dhan ko kam yaa samaapt kiya ja sakegaa
 Is GST really the drug of every merge? professor prabhaat patnayak ne jiesti ko lekar sangheey dhaanche ke kamazor padane kii ashanka zaahir kii he
 Understand the meaning of federal structure, that the center and states will make their economic decisions according to their needs
 jiesti ke baad rajyon ke liye tex ko lekar kuch karne ke liye nahin bachegaa
 They will depend on the center for everything
 lekin vitt mantri kaa daawa he ki zyaadaatar rajya jiesti ke liye sahamat ho gaye hai
 Only Tamil Nadu has some objections
 tippaniyan The Monsoon Session of Parliament may become historic due to GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill he
 After passing the Rajya Sabha, half of the states will have to pass the assembly
 vitt mantri daawa karte hai ki isse bharat kii jidipi do pratishat bad jaaegi
 Is our GDP less by 2 percent due to not having GST? jiesti ke kaaran ham kis aadhaar par aashaa kar rahe hai ki apratyaksh kar kaa aadhaar bad jayega
 Is India's GDP low because a lot of businesses are not counted
 agar jiesti kaa matlab ek tex hona tha to rajyon ko petroleum par waite or cells tex lagane kii chhot kyon di gai
 The central government will compensate the states for any revenue loss for three years
 uske baad rajasav nuksaan hoga to rajya kya karenge isaki koi charchaa yaa ham aam logon ke bich samaj nahin he
 The GST Council will decide by three quarters
 desh main raajnneeti sthaayee nahin he
 The BJP may have an edge in the current era, but what will be so easy for the anti-bjp state in the GST Council
 maujuuda vyavastha main hi fund ko lekar centre or rajya ke bich jhagade hote rahete hai
 Is it not so that the Finance Minister of the state will sit in the office of GST Council
 ek or sawaal uthta he ki jab saare kar jiesti council se tay honge to rajyon main vitt mantri kya karegaa
 We Hindi viewers should go through these complex subjects so that when the government passes it in Parliament and makes big claims about it, then we too can understand its usefulness and historicity
 jiesti lagu hoga to ek hi baar or ek hi jagah tex dena hoga
 Earlier, VAT and service tax had come, even then many dreams were shown about them
 lekin ab sabko milakar ek jiesti aa rahaa he to sapane bhi ek ho gaye hai
 Tax levies will increase and India's GDP will also increase from decimal nine to one and a half to two percent

 a case of alleged sexual misconduct with a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Narasaraopet in Andhra Pradesh has come to light
 is dauraan ladki kii photo bhi khinchi gai
 Two students have been arrested in the case of acquaintance
 police ne bataaya ki ghatana tab ghati, jab peedit ladki donon aropiyon- vaai sanjeev reddy or uske mitra es shiv kumaar se milane gai
 According to police, the two students allegedly sexually abused the girl and took objectionable pictures of her
 ladki kii medical jaanchashikayat milane ke baad police ne donon chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 The girl has been sent to a government hospital for medical examination
 videsh main padhai kar rahe bhartiya chaatro kaa tution evam hostal fees ke rup main kul kharch 44 fisadi bad chuki he
 This expenditure 1 in 2013-14
 9 arab dollar tha, jo ki 2017-18 main badhkar 2
 8 billion dollars have been made
 rigerv bank of india kii ek haalia report main anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki 2024 tak lagbhag 4,00,000 bhartiya chaatr videshi uniwarsities main daakhila lenge
 These figures clearly show that India is the second most important country after China in sending its students abroad for higher education
 philhal duniya bhar main 50 lakh se adhik chaatr apane desh se baahar shiksha praapt kar rahe hai or inamen bhartiya chaatro kii kaaphi badi sankhya he
 Countries like America, Canada and UK are the first choice of Indians in getting foreign education
 iske baad singapore, china, australia or germany or france jaise anya europea deshon kaa number aata he
 According to the RBI report, 85% of the total Indian students going abroad for higher education go to these countries
 haalanki, kai anya deshon kii uniwarsities main bhi daakhila lene vaale bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya badi he
 According to the report of news agency IANS, Tarun Mathur, Chief Business Officer, Policy Bazaar, says that covering medical expenses while going abroad for higher education is one of the most important reasons to buy travel insurance
 yah kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki videshon main medical kharche bharat kii tulana main kaaphi mahange ho sakate hai
 For example, a doctor's consulting fee in the US is between 300 and 400 dollars, which is around 20,500 to 27,000 rupees for India
 unhone kaha ki travel insurance na hone par agar ek chaatr videsh main biimaar padataa he, to use apane ek saptaah kaa bajet sirf doctor se paraamarsh / immergency room visit chargeej main hi kharch karnaa padegaa, jisamen dawaaon kii keemat shaamil nahin hoti
 In such a situation it is very important to get insurance cover so that the expenses incurred on falling ill can be avoided
 maathur ne kaha ki student travel insurance aapako medical immergency ke liye vyapak kawarej dene ke saath hi anya sambhavit mushkilon ke liye bhi suraksha detaa he, jaise ki padhai main rukaawat, sponcer protection, uniwarsity kii manyata radd hona, laptop / teble ko nuksaan, safar ke dauraan bagez, passport yaa anya jaruri dastavej kho janaa
 In such a situation, it is very important to ensure that some very serious aspects are kept in mind while purchasing a student travel insurance
 sabase mahatvapurn pahaluon main se ek yah dekhnaa hoga ki aapkaa student travel insurance aapaki uniwarsity dwaara jari dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karata ho
 If the coverage of a student travel insurance plan is not in conformity with the guidelines of the university, the concerned university will have the full right to reject the insurance waver benefit of the student or to cancel the admission itself
 america or canada kii adhiktar uniwarsities kii yah maang hoti he ki antarrashtriya chaatr apane liye ek aisa insurance plan rakhen jo pehle se maujuud bimariyon, drugs kii aadat, pregnancy or maansik bimariyon ke sabhi kharcho ko kisi bhi sab-limit ke bina cover karata ho
 Apart from this, some universities also insist that international students buy travel insurance from the insurance companies of their home countries
 videsh jane vaale bhartiya chaatro ke liye bhi yah behatar hoga ki bharat kii insurance companiyon se hi travel policy khariden kyonki yahaan keemten behad kam hoti hai or chaatro ko adhik phaayde bhi milte hai

 ) bhartiya janata party ne haryana ke mantri anil vij ke us bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya he, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki gandhi kaa naam judane se khaadi kii durgati hui thi
 At the same time, Vij said that now gradually Gandhi will also be removed from notes
 bayaan par bavaal badhata dekh vij ne bhi you-turn le liya or twit kiya ki mahatma gandhi par diya bayaan meraa nijee bayaan hai
 Don't hurt anyone's feelings, so i take it back
 vij ke bayaan par safai dene ke liye haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter bhi saamne aae
 Khattar said that this is his personal statement
 party kaa isse koi matlab nahin he
 Gandhi is the ideal of the country
 gandhijike kaaran rupee main giravat nahin ai
 Modiji used spinning wheel to promote Khadi
 ye pratik ke rup main he, iskaa matlab ye nahin ki koi gandhiji ko riples kar rahaa he
 bjp's Shrikant Sharma said the BJP strongly condemned Anil Vij's statement
 ye unki vyaktigat tippanee he or party kaa isse koi matlab nahin he
 Mahatma Gandhi is our icon
 party anil vij ke bayaan se apane ko alag kar liya party pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha yah unka nijee bayaan he or party unke bayaan se ittefaq nahin rakhti he
 Shrikant Sharma also said that the government and the party follow the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi
 party hameshaa apane netaaon or mantriyon ko yah hidaayat detii he ki vivaadaaspad bayaan dene se chote bade sabhi netaaon ko bachanaa chahie
 Anil Vij has also apologized for his statement after the party's instruction
 duusari taraf sharad yadav se lekar congress ke varisht netaa anand sharma yah kah rahe hai is tareeke ke vivaadaaspad bayaan dena bijepi netaaon kii puraani aadat he or isse gandhiji ke prati unke man main kitna sammaan he yah sabhi ko pataa chal gaya he
 It is clear that the controversy which has started from Khadi to Gandhi is not going to stop soon
 chunaavon ke is mausam main is tareeke ke bayaan aapako satta paksh or vipaksh donon se sunne ko milte rahenge
 On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Gandhi called it a campaign
 tushaar gandhi ne kaha ki ye party headquarter or aresas kii taraf se chalaaya jane vaale abhiyaan he
 Khadi is not a product, it is an ideology
 pradhanmantri gandhijike bare main bolte hai, lekin aisa bolne waalon ke khilaaf koi ection nahin lete
 CPIM leader Vrinda Karat also condemned Vij's statement, saying it was the same ideology that killed Gandhiji
 sabase pehle unhone is desh se gandhi kaa safaya kiya or ab wo unhen karency se bhi hataanaa chaahate hai
 Randeep Surjewala of the Congress said that one can expect similar objectionable and ludicrous statements from BJP leaders and ministers
 ye tha anil vij kaa bayanvij kaha ki gandhi kaa naam aisa he jiske judane se khaadi dub gai he
 Modi is a better brand than him, so it is good that Modi has a photo instead of Gandhi
 gandhi kaa naam to noton par he jisase rupee kii divaluation ho gai he
 When Vij was asked why the government had put Gandhi on the new notes, Vij said that he too would withdraw gradually

 In his campaign to make Chidambaram a co-accused, Subrahmanyam Swamy has filed a petition in the 2G trial court

 C
 avasthi or tatkaaleen atirikt sachiv, vitt, sindhushri khullar ko saman jari karne kii maang karenge
 Subrahmanyam Swami himself is the panch-sarpanch and the executioner - all together
 dilli main nizamuddin east sthit apane nivas par jab ve sandip bamazai se mili, to unka muskaraata hua cheharaa sab kuch kah rahaa tha
 He is confident that he has come close to sending Chidambaram to jail as a co-accused
 mukhya anshah-17 disambar ke liye kya ranneeti he?main ek behad najuk padtaal kii koshish karata rahaa hum or sochataa hum ki main safal ho rahaa hum-vichaar yah he ki vishesh sibiai jaj o
 P
 saini ke vivek ke liye bahut hi kam chijen chodi jaaen
 He is a very good judge, but there is a lot at stake and not a single mistake can be tolerated
 maine abhiyog paksh ke ek jaankaar vakil kii haisiyat se lagbhag 200 pannon ke saath tark die hai
 On December 17, i will come as a complainant and argue why Chidambaram needs to be co-accused in the 2G hearing
 agar jaj is baat se santusht hote hai ki main khokhli baat nahin kar rahaa hum to ve pehali najar main yah sanket de sakate hai ki chidambaram ne aparaadh kiya he
 -what will be your statement? The starting point is clearly Judge Saini's former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke khilaaf tay kiye gaye aarope honge
 Chidambaram was talking to him at every stage, agreeing with him and being his senior partner in rigging, he had the knowledge to fix spectrum prices all the time, and most importantly, on January 10, 2008, he asked Raja All decisions taken were blindly approved
 mujhe koi bhram nahin he ki is bheeshan bhrashtachar maamle main chidambaram zyada bade bhagidaar the
 Everyone has acted on his instructions — mainly Raja and Karunanidhi
 isi cheez se raja ko pradhanmantri ko angootha dikhaane kii himmat mili
 -what will you do next? i would argue that February 11, 2008 is a note from the Department of Economic Affairs which will conclusively prove that Chidambaram's Ministry of Finance, Rs 1,650 crore was recovered from the nine operators of Raja
 kii jagah spectrum kii keemat 5,772 karod ru
 Was ready to apply
 mere tark kaa majboot hissaa yah he ki 10 janvari ko jari kiye gaye letters of intent se faisle ko qaraar banane kii haisiyat nahin milti
 i will prove that if Chidambaram wanted, this decision could be reversed
 isse bhi badhkar license jari ho jane ke baad bhi, 25 march, 2011 ko vitt mantralay kaa offis memorondom spasht taur par kahata he ki agar mantralay chahta to license kii sharten badali ja sakati thim
 Giving Cidi a clean chit to Chidambaram, now what was meant to be done is nonsense
 -aap aisa kaise kah sakate hai?22 november, 2007 ko vitt sachiv ne telecom sachiv ko likhaa tha, iskaa uttar 29 november ko de diya gaya tha, jo saaf taur par sabit karata he ki chidambaram ko sab pataa tha
 On December 17, a note was given to assess market prices
 samachar agency press trust of india (pitii) ascharyajanak dhang se 8 janvari ko samachar detii he jisamen un companiyon ke naamon kii suchi hoti he, jinhen license die jaaenge
 How does it happen that PTI knows who will get licenses? Even more concrete is the position paper prepared on 9 January 2008 by Sindhushree Khullar, then Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Finance
 yah note 3 janvari ko taiyaar kiya gaya tha or 9 janvari ko pesh kiya gaya
 This note forms the core of Chidambaram's letter to the Prime Minister, whose last words were well-known — we should consider this a closed chapter
 -aapako kya lagata he ki jaj saini 17 disambar ko kya karenge?mujhe koi shaq nahin he ki chidambaram ko pehle se pataa tha, baad main bhi pataa tha or abhi bhi 2ji ke bare main jo bhi kuch jaanane laayak he, vah sab pataa he
 There are two things a judge can do after hearing my statement as a complainant
 ve mujhe khullar ko cross-ejamin karne kii anumati denge, jinase main ek saadhaaran sawaal puuchhuunga-ki aapane apane mantri ko yah bataaya tha yaa nahin bataaya tha ki tranjection of bijness ke niyam unhen 9 janvari, yani 10 janvari kii ghatnaon ke ek din pehle tak bhi, yah maamla cabinet ko refer karne kaa adhikaar dete hai?isi tarah main avasthi se puuchhuunga ki agency ne etisalaat or telenor par karrwai kyon nahin kii
 The Supreme Court had handed over documents related to these two companies to the CBI counsel in February 2011
 in dastavejon se sabit hota he ki in donon companiyon ko bharat main kaarobaar karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie, kyonki ye pakistan or china ke saath kaarobaar karti hai
 The Supreme Court had asked the CBI to investigate the matter as the Home Ministry wanted to ban these two companies
 main avasthi se poochna chahta hum-agar aapako yah dastavej mili, to aapane in par karrwai kyon nahin kii or aapane swaan or unitech wireles donon main nae sheyaron kii bikri in do companiyon ko kaise ho jane di?-chidambaram ke liye aapaki naapsandgi kii vajah kya he?meri unase koi dushmani nahin he
 Karunanidhi had said that i am a Brahmin, so i have a rage with the king
 unhone kaha tha ki main mahila virdohi hum, isliye kanimoli se meraa vair-bhav he
 What will they say now? The truth is that Chidambaram has a hatred for the Congress people
 mujhe dil se apeksha he ki main unhen jail bhijwa duungaa
 -you made a lot of noise about Anil Ambani and Ratan Tata's name not being in the charge sheet, and not even a word about Ruia? i have had an old dispute with Ambani because once i was the Commerce Minister, i helped Nusli Wadia Which was like showing red cloth to the bull
 nira radia ke saath tata kii sanliptata laalach kii misaal he
 i am interested in focusing on cases against leaders
 agar aap raajnneeti main hai, to vyavsaayiyon ko jaananaa lajimi hi he
 i am a citizen
 main sibiai nahin hum
 - In which direction is this hearing going? There are more than 150 witnesses and the sixth testimony is going on
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki isamen shaamil saare netaa doshi sabit honge-raja, kanimoli, chidambaram, dayaanidhi maaran or do anya netaa, jinka naam main abhi jaahir nahin karuunga
 As far as businessmen are concerned, it is dependent on the CBI
 lekin meri padtaal kaa nateeja nikalegaa
 Now i have come very close
 -aapako itnaa vishwaas kyon he ki chidambaram doshi hai?is maamle main, main pratham drushtya dosha se aage gaya hum
 i am confident that Chidambaram will be made an accused
 dosha sabit karwaane ke liye mere paas saboot hai
 - What three things do you expect to happen next? i think the process of conviction will start in July
 lagbhag usee samay se sampatti jabt kii jaaegi
 In the end, i would like those who have so far managed to escape the public gaze — media, lobbyists and others of the same kind — to suffer the brunt
 hamen bharat kii aatma ko phir se jagaanaa he or laalach or sarkaar-vyavsaayiyon kii mileebhagat vaali poonjivadi vyavastha ko jad se samaapt karnaa he

 Apart from this, a proposal of 22 thousand crores is also under consideration with the Central Government for providing drought relief package to farmers

 Overall 90 per cent of the state is drought prone
 iske baavjood naukarshahon ne chhattisgarh main dhan kii kharidi ke liye kareeb 70 lakh metric ton dhan kharidne kaa faisla liya he
 That too at a cost of about 15 thousand crores
 yah faisla aise samay kiya gaya he jab rajya ke tamaam khet khalihaanon main sookhe kii vajah se paidaavaar hui hi nahin or kisaan sookhaa raahat ke liye sadako par he

 On the other hand, Chief Minister Raman Singh took the claim of farmers' sympathy to the state bureaucracy so seriously that despite being drought-prone, he decided to buy 70 lakh metric tonnes of paddy and for this, sending proposals to the central government for more than 10 thousand crores The amount of Rs
 70 lakh metric ton dhan kharidne kii afasaron kii manshaa us samay paravaan chadhati he jab rajya ke kisi bhi hisse main naa to sookhaa padataa or naa hi fasalon par keet patangon kaa hamalaa hota he or to or monsoon bhi pure pradesh main acchhee tarah se meharbaan hota
 But the plan to buy paddy was made

 But the farmers came on the roads
 unhone sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki jab sookhaa he or paidaavaar hi nahin hui to aakhir dhan kahaan se aegi

 Anil Dubey, president of the United Farmers Front, alleges that some government officials and government ministers want to divert paddy from neighboring states and consume paddy in the state
 isse unka phayda hoga, lekin yahaan ke kisaanon kaa hit maaraa jaayegaa
 According to him, when the paddy is not produced due to the drought, then the government will not have the answer to say that paddy will come

 My role is, but the credit of victory should be given to the people of these states, the Congress workers and the infrastructure we have built
 '' ve aage or spasht karte hai, "ham 10 saal satta main the or mujhe dukh ke saath kahana padegaa ki congress party ahamkaari ho gai thi

 With humility comes the understanding of this country and the way forward
 ''yah un badlaavon main se ek he jo rahul congress party main nai jaan foonkane or use ek baar phir desh ke vikaas kii awwal takat banane ke liye laa rahe hai
 The energy and clarity needed to complete the enormous tasks that Rahul has set for his party are now visible in him
 pichley disambar main jab unhone apni viraat duvidha se nijaat pai thi or party kaa adhyaksh banane ke liye apni naamajadagi sweekaar kii thi, tab unki shuruyaat kuch zyada shubh dhang se nahin hui thi

 The defeat was the pinnacle of a bad year for the Congress, when in 2017 it lost to three of its ruling states — Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur — the BJP also let Goa slip away

 In the last four years, he made a lot of desperate efforts to add to the scattered fabric of the party after the tremendous defeat of 2014

 unhen apni siyaasi taasir khojani hi hogi varanaa unhen or saath main unki party ko bhi itihaas ke koodaydaan ke hawaale kar diya jayega
 How did it happen for Rahul Gandhi if not now? As a leader, Rahul actively participated in politics in 2003 and gradually started learning the tricks of politics
 ek nami rajnatik khandaan se taalluk rakhane or raajnneeti kii lambii viraasat ke baavjood, rahul raajnneeti main kabhi bahut swaabhaavik or sahaj nahin rahe
 Even after joining the party at the age of 34, he hesitated to go ahead and take up big responsibilities
 unhone parade ke peeche se kaam karnaa pasand kiya
 Their impulsive decisions, feeling uneasy under the umbrella of the party's old stalwarts, and what they said with sharp temper often led to some controversy
 rahul shuru se hi alag kism kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate the
 He used to tell his friends that he was "shocked" seeing the superficiality of Indian politics
 ve usee bhedchaal main shaamil ek or netaa nahin ban janaa chaahate yaa phir raajnneeti main bas isliye nahin aana chaahate kyonki ve ek rajnatik parivaar se aate hai or apane parivaar kii viraasat sanbhaalani chahie
 He wanted the Navnirman of the Congress from bottom to top, but he soon understood that there are more leaders in the party than the workers and all these are connected because they find politics very profitable
 jaisaa ki ve kehete hai, "desh ke sabhi rajnatik dalon ke saath judi ek saanskrithik samasya hi meri sabase badi chunauti he
 All leaders — though there are some exceptions — become arrogant once they come to power and begin to think that they are now kings
 par jaisaa ki mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha—ve trustee bhar hai
 "during the 10-year tenure of the Congress-led UPA government, Rahul had many opportunities when he could come forward and take up the responsibility, but Rahul told his friends that he would never ask the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, or party president Sonia Gandhi The Beech did not want to be an alternative center of power
 unhone parade ke peeche se hi bhoomikaayen nibhaana pasand kiya
 Recently he revealed that when the UPA was in power, he introduced the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) and worked towards making it successful
 iske alaava congress ke sheersh mantriyon or netaaon ke saath ve kashmir main halaat saamaanya karne kii disha main prayaas kar rahe the

 Rahul was born into a distinguished and noble family
 unase vishesh mahanata kii hameshaa apeksha kii jaati, yaa kaha jaae ki kai baar thopi di jaati thi
 But Rahul believes that whenever he does this great work, he will do it on his own terms and when he himself — not his party or his mother — will feel that he is truly ready for it
 raajnneeti main aane ke 14 saal baad unhen mahasoos hua ki vah samay aa gaya he
 Why did he choose to become the party president only last year? Rahul says, "the Congress party is an ideology whose roots are strengthened by deep thoughts
 mujhe laga ki in vichaaron ko samajhane ke liye mujhe thodaa samay chahie
 Now i understand it better
 '' unke virodhiyon ne unki hichkichaahat ko unki kamajori kii nishaani bataaya or akshep kiya ki rahul main desh kii sabase puraani party kaa netritv karne or desh ko aage le jane kaa madda nahin he
 However, the country had no need to wait for him or the Congress
 jaisaa ki upie sarkaar apane duusare kaarykaal main bahut se morchon par chook karti gai or rahul bhi khud ko asamanjas or anirnay kii sthiti se baahar nahin nikaal paae
 All this became a place for the extraordinary rise of Narendra Modi
 ek mukhyamantri jise sampradayik hinsa se nibatane ko lekar hameshaa kathghare main khadaa kiya gaya, modi ne ek nayaa fasaana gadha jisase desh prabhavit hua
 Modi took full advantage of the indecision of the Congress leadership

 His trust in the Namdars to stay in power is surprising everyone

 The Congress performed poorly and Rahul and Sonia were able to save their seats
 rahul ke liye 2014 kii haar "baari tufaan'' tha or rahul sweekaar karte hai ki "yah mere liye sabase makul baat'' thi
 It was a moment of litmus test
 yah keval atmavlokan kaa nahin balki kuch karne kaa samay tha
 Rahul accepted the challenge
 unhone congress sanghathan kii thaah leni shuru kar di
 There was a deep gap between the old and the young and Rahul had to bridge that gap
 unhen dikh rahaa tha ki ek congress ke bheetar do congress sakriy hai
 Instead of putting the old veterans in a corner, many of which he had overlooked earlier, Rahul also took him along to take advantage of his understanding and experience and also make room for the younger leadership in the party
 unhone kaaphi mashkkat kii he
 Everyone had to be given reasonable rights and space
 unhone kaha ki yah "congress kaa sandpaper'' tha jisane unke khurdure kinaaron ko ghiskar chikna kar diya
 Rahul's second formula was to create a talented team consisting of old and young leaders in every state

 In an informal conversation with party workers during the Madhya Pradesh election campaign, state Congress veteran Digvijay Singh said, "I will not even go to give a speech because the Congress loses if i speak
 '' vah bayaan camere main kaid ho gaya or media ne ise digvijay singh kaa bagawati rukh mana
 Rahul spoke and urged him to be on the stage with him at the Jaura rally near Morena on the same day

 When Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala administered the oath to the BJP government, Rahul called Abhishek Manu Singhvi from Chandigarh to knock the door of the Supreme Court
 is tarah rajya main bhaajapa sarkaar ko 48 ghante ke bheetar hi istipha dena padaa
 Rahul's bets on Ahmed Patel, Kamal Nath and Gehlot show that he is now beginning to understand that behind-the-scenes maneuvers are also very important in electoral politics
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, "2019 main, congress ko modi ke karishme or bhaajapa kii paise kii takat se laduya hoga

 Earlier this year, Rahul launched the Shakti mobile application, which not only provides information about new people joining the party, but also facilitates a two-way dialogue between the Congress president and grassroots activists

 This is an insult to India

 We believe that this country has to be run harmoniously, not by autocracy or dictatorship
 congress kii vichaardhaara logon ko yah mahasoos karaati he ki ve ek mahaan mishan kaa mukhya hissaa hai
 This is the mantra of Congress
 vipaksh or bhaajapa ke bhi kuch log ise samajhate hai
 Since the defeat of the Congress in 2014, Rahul had identified the RSS as one of the biggest threats to the Congress's existence
 apane aakraamak hindutv ke agenda ke saath or sangh parivaar ke samarthan se bhaajapa ne khaasi kamyaabi ke saath ek afasana khadaa kar liya tha, jisamen congress ko musalamaanon kii tarafdaar party ke taur dekha-dikhaaya jaataa tha or yah bhi ki uski is tarafdaari kaa khamiaja bahusankhyak samudaay ko uthaanaa padaa he
 It is said in the party circles that the decision to challenge the bjp's monopoly on Hinduism was taken very carefully, which led to the emergence of a new Rahul Gandhi from the Janudehari Brahmin to the Dattatreya gotra
 iske saath hi rahul ko pataa he ki unka apana awwal nishaanaa narendra modi hi hone chahie
 He said, "at 8 pm Modi got an illusion and he destroyed the informal economy through demonetisation
 badakismati se kai morchon par naakaam hone ke liye modi kii aalochana karne ke alaava rahul ne abhi tak vikaas kaa apana koi aisa vaikalpik afasana yaa najariya saamne nahin rakhaa he jo matadaataaon ko—or kaarobaariyon ko—lubhaa sake
 While the victory of three states has raised the expectations of the Congress, on the basis of the margin of victory and defeat, if the scheme of the Lok Sabha seats is put in place, it is known that the party will win only 32 of these 65 seats
 agar party kii hukumat vaale duusare rajyon karnataka, punjab or puduccheri kii 42 siton ko bhi jod len, to bhi ye kul mahaj 107 siten hi hoti hai
 In such a situation, the only way for the Congress to oust the BJP from power in 2019 is to form an alliance with other opposition parties
 rahul kehete hai ki ve "in siyaasi partiyon ke saath baatcheet ke liye khule'' hai or unka lakshya in partiyon ke alag-alag prabhaav kshetron kaa sammaan karte hue unke saath "milakar kaam karnaa'' he
 While defeating the BJP in 2019 is a difficult task like climbing mountains, Rahul knows that he will have to climb many more mountains before achieving this

 agar aap chaah kar bhi makaan nahin bana paa rahe hai yaa sampatti nahin kharid paa rahe hai to ye upaay karen-- beti ke ghar main aane ke baad kisi bhi mangalvaar ko uske haath se gud le len

 When the Sinha family started distributing invitation cards among the people about Nilesh's wedding, friends and relatives praised him a lot

 saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mahatvakankshi abhiyaan- beti bachaao beti padhaao kaa logo bhi card par chhapavaya gaya he
 Regarding Nilesh Kumar Sinha's wedding card, his elder brother Ritesh Kumar Sinha said, through this card, he has given a social message to the public and told that he has not taken any dowry in this marriage
 neelesh kumaar kii bhabhi vandana sinha kahati hai, jab parivaar ke bich shaadi card chhapavane ko lekar baat ho rahi thi to sabhi ne milakar yah faisla kiya ki vah bihar or centre sarkaar ke in do bade abhiyaan kaa sandesh vah apane doston or rishtedaaron ke bich bhi prachaarit karenge
 It was only after this decision of the whole family that Nilesh's wedding card was printed on which Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and message against dowry was also printed

 Taking serious cognizance of the latest sensational report of phone tapping, senior BJP leader LK Advani compared the incident to the Emergency days
 ek patrika ke taaja ank kaa hawala dete hue adwani ne apane ke blog main likhaa he ki yah ek ‘hilaa dene vaali report he jisamen khulaasa kiya gaya he ki bharat sarkaar kaise naveenatam phone teping takanic kaa istemaal pramukh raajnneetik netaaon ke bich kii telephonic baatcheet ko ricard karne main kar rahi he
 These prominent leaders include Chief Ministers like Nitish Kumar, Union Ministers like Sharad Pawar, Communist leaders like Prakash Karat, and their own party officials like Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 ‘puraane pad chuke’ telephone adhinium ko samaapt kiye jane kii maang karte hue adwani ne nagarikon kii niztaa kii sangraksha ke liye ek nayaa kanoon banaae jane kii bhi vakaalat kii
 He has written in the blog, 'what is really necessary in this context is that in order to investigate all aspects of the problem, to abolish the wasted Indian Telephone Act 1885 and to protect the privacy of the common citizen, in its place a new a parliamentary committee should be set up on the lines of the Briquette Committee in Britain to enact legislation
 ’adwani ne blog main likhaa he ki nayaa kanoon aisa ho jo aam nagarikon kii niztaa kii suraksha kare lekin jo aupchaarik rup se keval aparaadh, ghotaale tathaa jasusi ke maamalon main hi rajya ko naveenatam iti takanic ke istemaal ko manyata de
 This law must have statutory safety standards which make it impossible for the government to misuse the powers of this law against political activists and media persons
 25 saal puraani ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue adwani likhte hai
 'it reminds me of a 25-year-old incident that dealt with me
 1985 kii ek subah, ek ajanabi mere ghar par aayaa jiske haath main kaagajon se bharaa ek brifces tha
 'that stranger said,' This briefcase contains dynamite, which can blow up this government
 ’ usne apana brifces kholaa or kareeb 200 pannon kaa dher laga diya jinamein kai ati vishisht hastiyon kii telephone baatcheet kaa ricard darj tha
 But Advani did not find these documents so 'explosive' as the gentleman had told him
 inamen se kuch kaagajon main adwani kii atal bihari vaajapeyi se hui baatcheet kaa byora tha
 Advani wrote, "it was more surprising that these documents not only recorded the conversations between opposition leaders but also recorded conversations of some eminent journalists and very eminent personalities like Giani Zail Singh
 ’adwani ke blog main purv main phone teping kii kai ghatnaon kaa zikr kiya gaya he jinamein 25 june 1985 kaa ek samvaadadaata sammelan bhi shaamil tha
 This day was the tenth anniversary of the Emergency in which Vajpayee not only mentioned other excesses of the Emergency but also mentioned the large-scale phone tapping incidents in this period of 19 months
 unhone likhaa he ki us samvaadadaata sammelan main vaajapeyi ne kaha, ‘mujhe lambey samay se pataa he ki mere tathaa mere party sahyogi adwani ke phone par najar rakhi ja rahi he
 'but Vajpayee said,' But later i came to know that the phones of journalists like Chaudhary Charan Singh, Jagjivan Ram and Chandrashekhar, journalists like GK Reddy, Arun Shourie, Kuldeep Nair and GS Chawla are also regularly taped
 
 lekin isse bhi adhik sadma mujhe yah jaankaar laga ki khufia beuro ne raashtrapati or pradhan nyaayadhish tak ke phone tepe kiye hai
 All this is not only politically immoral but also unconstitutional and illegal
 ’phone teping kii ek or ghatana kaa zikr karte hue blog main adwani ne likhaa he ‘1996 main jab devgauda pradhanmantri the, us samay purv grih mantri es bi chavaan kii aguwai main ek ucch stareey congress pratinidhimandal ne unase shikaayat kii ki pi ve narsinha raav tathaa kai anya varisht congressi netaaon ke phone uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara tepe kiye ja rahe hai

 One year passed during demonetisation
 koi badi fatah haath nahin lagi
 The 5,000 crore rupees that came under the Poor Kalyan Kalyan Yojana, which can be considered as black money officially acquired from demonetisation
 shesh sab kuch jaanch yug main he yaa daavon par savaar he
 So where will you find black money? Chhora next to the village, Dhindora in the village
 kaale dhan ke kuch bade rahasy sarkari kii pyaari-dulaari jan dhan yojana ke paas hai
 Which was started to connect the poor with banking
 notebandi ke baad sarkaar jan dhan par sannata khinch gai he lekin aankade to uplabdh hai
 The Reserve Bank had released the report on the impact of demonetisation in March
 vitt mantri ne 3 farvari ko sansad main ek sawaal ke jawaab main kuch jaankaree di thi, sarkari aankadon par aadhaarit duusare adhyayan bhi uplabdh hai
 Based on these, see what happened to Jan Dhan during demonetisation? • Around 73,000 accounts were being opened per day between April and July before demonetisation but two lakh accounts were opened every day during demonetisation
 note badalane kii sabhi simaaen khatm hone ke baad (march se july se 2017) ke bich jan dhan khate khulne kaa ausat dainik ghatakar 92,000 par aa gaya
 • 23 just after demonetisation
 30 karod nae jan dhan khate khole gaye
 Of these, 80 percent opened in public sector banks
 lagbhag 54 fisadi shaharon main khule or shesh gaanvon kii shakhaon main
 At the time of demonetisation (9 November 2016), a total of Rs 456 billion was deposited in these accounts which reached 746 billion rupees on 7 December 2016
 • notebandi ke 53 dinon main jan dhan khaaton main 42,187 karod rupye jamaa hue
 Of these, Rs 18,616 crore were deposited in these accounts in the first eight days between November 9 and November 16
 ye aankada notebandi se pehle ke 53 dinon ke mukaable 1850 fisadi zyada he
 • Before demonetisation, on an average, there was a daily deposit of Rs 43 crore in Jan Dhan accounts
 notebandi shuru ho hote hi pehle hakrate main prati din 2,327 karod rupye jamaa hone lage
 As soon as demonetisation was over, the average daily transaction decreased by 95 percent
 • notebandi ke dauraan jan dhan kii takat dikhaane waalon main gujarat sabase aage rahaa
 From 9 November 2016 to 25 January 2017, the deposits of Jan Dhan accounts of the state increased by 94 percent
 isi avadhi main karnataka main jan dhan diposit 81 fisadi, madhya pradesh va maharashtra main 60 fisadi, jharkhand or rajasthan main 55 fisadi, bihar main 54 fisadi, haryana main 50 fisadi, uttar pradesh main 45 fisadi or dilli main 44 fisadi bade
 • On 15 November 2016, after seeing a 40% growth in deposits in the first week of demonetisation in Jan Dhan accounts, the Finance Ministry stopped the deposit of more than 50 thousand rupees in Jan Dhan
 • notebandi ke dauraan jan dhan khaaton kaa ausat balance 180 fisadi tak bad gaya tha, jo march main ghatakar notebandi ke pehle vaale str par aa gaya
 • The behavior of zero balance accounts of the poor raises deep questions
 notebandi ke dauraan in khaaton kii sankhya main apratyaashit badhotaree kaa rahasy kya he?vitt mantri ne farvari main sansad ko bataaya tha ki vibhinn khataadharakon (jan dhan sahit) ko iskar vibhaag ne 5,100 notice bheje hai, iske baad notebandi jan dhan istemaal kii jaanch kahaan kho gai?notebandi ke dauraan aniyamitata ko lekar bainkon kii shuru hui jaanch bhi bich main kyon chhot gai?ham itani jaldi is nishkarsh par nahin pahunchnaa chaahate ki jan dhan khaaton kaa istemaal mani londring main hua lekin notebandi ke dauraan bainkon ke bheetar bahut kuch aisa hua he jo rahasyamay he or notebandi kii vifaltaa kii vajah ho saktaa he
 The misfortune of the biggest campaign to connect the common people with banking is that it has become a victim of the policy thrill of the government
 banking par aam logon ke bharose ko gahari chot lagi he
 In democracy, the public is Ajatshatru
 yah sarkaron kii vifaltaaon ko bhi pachaa leti he
 Policies should be transparent
