 In such a situation, the RJD should not be immersed in water instead of celebration
 argedy lagaataar apane jeet kaa dhindhora peetane main lagi he
 Apparently the election took place at a time when RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav is in jail and the entire campaign for the campaign was on Tejashwi Yadav
 aise main seat ko bachaana hi badi baat thi
 RJDK chief spokesperson and MLA Bhai Virendra says victory is victory
 arriya main ham jite hai
 It was Lok Sabha election
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko to istipha de dena chahie
 Elections were held in three seats in Bihar, in which the RJD retained the Araria Lok Sabha and Jehanabad assembly seats and the BJP retained the Bhabhua seat
 nandakishor yadav ne kaha ki zyada khush hone kii jarurat nahin he, iskaa koi prabhaav 2019 ke chunaav par nahin padane vaala he

 aisi hi unki ek yojana ke tahat punjab ke sabase puraane kshetreey dal shiromani akali dal ke adhyaksh, 49 varshiya sukhbir badal ne na sirf congress ko haraa diya balki arase se chali aa rahi parampara ko bhi dhwast kar diya
 The electoral outcome of the Punjab Assembly has the charisma of the ruling party winning again after four decades
 sukhbir ne yah kaise kiya, aaie dekhte hai
 After being elected the youngest head of the Shiromani Akali Dal in January 2008, Sukhbir announced that the Akali Dal would rule Punjab for the next 25 years
 congress ne ise ding qaraar dekar khaarij kar diya tha
 Sukhbir says in a confident manner to a top corporate boss, 'people misunderstood me at that time
 25 varsh koi naaraa nahin tha
 This was my plan
 ’sukhbir kii tulana kisi top korporate bos se karnaa betuka nahin he
 He says that he has fully absorbed every lesson he learned in the management school, both in his administration and election campaign
 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main california state uniwarsity se emb karne vaale sukhbir sarkaar ko kisi vishaal korporation kii tarah chalaate hai
 They set priorities for themselves and have time-bound goals
 ve kehete hai, ‘meraa agenda na to amarinder singh the or na congress party
 From my first day as the Deputy Chief Minister in January 2009, i pledged that Punjab would be my only priority
 ’sukhbir kehete hai ki ab ve ‘asli punjabi party’ kaa netritv karte hai
 The Akali members in the Legislative Assembly are more Hindu than the Congress
 haalanki ve yah spasht karne main jaraa bhi der nahin lagaate ki akali dal kabhi bhi ‘sikhi or nyaay ke liye sangharsh’ main maujuud apni jadon se nazren nahin pherega
 Pointing to the 24 members who won the election for the first time in the ruling party, Sukhbir says, 'A new generation of Punjabis has come forward
 ’sukhbir ne saare ghode khol die
 His friends and rivals all believe that Sukhbir not only paid heavily to the party candidates, but also helped the Bahujan Samaj Party candidates and the Congress rebels to cut the Congress votes
 sukhbir maanate hai, ‘chunaav main aapako paisa to kharch karnaa hi padataa he, lekin sirf paise se jeet hasil nahin kii ja sakati
 Suffering from the rising government debt of Punjab, Sukhbir says that he wants to continue the 'jitau formula' of fixed target populism and clear governance
 ve kehete hai, ‘aaj teji se aage badhane ke liye aapako paison kii nahin, balki achche or kaam karne vaale vichaaron kii jarurat hoti he
 'punjab, which generates more electricity than it needs in two years, four to six-lane roads between all cities by the end of the third year and three international airports in running condition by the end of its current term
 It is said that despite the losses arising due to the receipt of tax holidays from the Central Government to the neighboring states, huge investment will come in the state
 ’sukhbir kehete hai ki unhen zyaadaatar prerana narendra modi, en
 Chandrababu meets people like Naidu and Nitish Kumar
 lekin unke mukhya guru unke pita hi hai
 He says, 'I have done MBA from America, but i am still learning politics from Badal Sahib
 ’ chandigarh ke sector 9 main sthit apni mahalanuma nijee kothi main thor jamaa chuke sukhbir is bare main kaam abhi se shuru kar chuke hai ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kaa prabandhan kaise kiya jaae

 congress ke 13 or jedy(es) ke 3 vidhayakon ne apane istife de die the
 Apart from this, the KPJP and Independent mlas have also withdrawn support from the government

 a post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Dec 19, 2018 at 2:48am PST Prashant Pandey, who exposed the Vyapam scam, has been summoned by the CBI for questioning in connection with its investigation into the huge irregularities in recruitment for government jobs done by the Madhya Pradesh Vocational Examination Board (vyapam)
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki pandeya ko sibiai adhikariyon ne shuukravaar ko apane mukhyalay par upasthit hone ko kaha he
 Pandey told his hometown in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh, "I have received notice from the CBI to appear at his Delhi office, although i requested to extend the date for a week because my road accident in May Grandmother passed away tragically
 'pandeya ne kaha ki unki daadi durghatana main us vakt ghayal ho gai thim jab vah apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke saath chah may ko madhya pradesh main car se ja rahe the
 He claimed that the accident was an attempt to kill him
 unhone kaha, 'kuch rasmon kii vajah se mujhe or samay kii aavashyaktaa he, jo mujhe ummid he ki wo mujhe karne denge
 Pandey is yet to receive confirmation from CBI to extend the date to appear before the agency

 -input language farvari 2016 main jeenyu main kathith desh virdohi naare lagaae jane ke baad desh bhar main rashtrawaad par charchaa chhid gai
 After the incident, JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested under treason
 ghatnakram chalata rahaa or aaj puraa ek saal bitne ke baad bhi jeenyu prakaran me chargeshit daakhil nahin ho pai
 a forensic investigation of the voice sample of slogans chanted by Aaj Tak in JNU showed that Kanhaiya's voice is not present in those slogans, but the voices of Umar Khalid and Anirban are present
 haalanki jeenyu campus ke chappe-chappe kii ajtak kii padtaal se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki vahaan ab bhi kai jagah aise vivaadaaspad poster lage hai, jinhen desh virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 This year the matter has been raised in Delhi University where a question of about 20 years old Gurmehar Kaur has shaken the whole system
 lekin abivipi kaa aarope he ki diu main bhi desh virdohi naare lagaae gaye
 Amidst these allegations, du's wires began to be attached to JNU as DU had already raised controversy over the summoning of JNU students and Omar Khalid, accused of anti-national slogans in JNU
 to aakhir aisa kya he jeenyu main jisaki vajah se desh kaa ek sabase behtareen or ucch shiksha santhaan vivaadon kaa centre ban gaya he? ajtak ne puraa din jeenyu campus main bataaya or chappe-chappe ko chaanakar pataa lagaaya us eks factor kaa, jisaki vajah se jeenyu par ungliyaan uthati hai
 While walking on the JNU campus where many posters meet for the legitimate rights of the students, there are many posters which are the root of the controversy
 freedom squaire par poster varajeenyu admin block jise freedom squaire ke naam se janaa jaataa hai, vahaan rohit vemula kii tasviir he, to saath main vah poster bhi hai jo kehete hai ki "farvari 2016 main ham lade ore aage bhi ladenge
 'we had a stop in the campus visit - School of Social Science and there were some posters which were also controversial
 jahaan ek poster main faansee kii sajaa rokane kii maang thi, to ek duusare poster main gujarat or mujffarnagar dangon ke liye aresas or bijepi ko jimmedaar bataate hue hamalaa bolaa gaya he
 This face of student politics amidst the demand for freedom of expression and that too within the university, raises a question
 isi block main aage hamen abivipi ke wo poster dikhe, jo tamaam aatanki sanghathanon ko ek bataate hai, to duusare gut BASO ke poster main 50 saal ke naksalbadi andolan kii baat kehete hue likhaa gaya he ki naksalbadi andolan kabhi khatm nahin hoga
 This poster has been put up in support of the Naxalbari movement
 BASO vahi sanghathan he jisase umr khalid jude hai
 It was only in the posterschool of social science that was independence for Kashmir that we saw the picture which makes JNU in the circle of controversies
 is poster par likhaa he- 'kashmir ke liye aazaadee
 'this is the same controversial slogan that resonated at JNU in February 2016 and more recently at Ramjas College
 poster par saaf-saaf likhaa he, kashmir ke liye aazaadee or philistin kii aazaadee, jise lagaaya he democratic student union (dsu) ne
 Leader of the left-wing student group SFI, Deepshita, says that it is the freedom of expression of students who advocate the independence of Kashmir, but not necessarily the full support of JNU
 deepshita kaa kahana he ki ek bada gut he jo yah maanata he ki kashmir se sena hate, lekin bharat se kashmir kii aazaadee koi nahin maangata
 However, this poster in JNU denies sfi's claim
 is vivaadaaspad poster se pataa chalata he ki aakhir kyon jeenyu main kathith desh virdohi naare lagate hai or kyon jeenyu par sawaal uthte hai
 DSU is the same organization to which Omar Khalid and Anirban were associated, who are also accused in the JNU sloganeering case
 haalanki donon saal 2015 ke ant main hi dsu se istipha de diya tha
 Speaking on the controversy of posters and slogans against rights and the country, JNU students Sandeep and Mahesh say that everything seems controversial which is against anyone
 donon kaa maananaa he ki jeenyu main har baat par charchaa hoti he
 Kashmir is also discussed, but his opinion on Kashmir independence from India is not clear on the poster
 sandip kaa kahana he kashmir main logon ke adhikaron par baat honi chahie
 At the same time, the other student group ABVP claims that many times in JNU there have been activities which are objectionable and against the country
 tamaam aaropon or daavon ke bich jeenyu ke se vivaadaaspad poster hi ve badi vajah hai, jo har baar vivaadon ko janm dete hai
 However, after the news of Aaj Tak, the JNU administration has ordered the removal of the poster

 duniya ke mahanatam leg spinner shen worne kii kamaal kii shakhsiyat kii vajah se ab kisi bhi umdaa leg spinner ko lekar ek alag dharna zarur banane lagati he
 Perhaps this is the reason why the 36-year-old leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who was born in Lahore, made a mark in England's domestic cricket, has made a mark in South Africa for Tests and odis, and has now won the IPL
 a different image is formed
 ipel 8 main ab tak 13 wicket lekar dilli jaisi team ke hero bane hue imran taahir kaa vyaktitv ko lekar jitne rahasy banate dikhte hai haqikat main imran utane hi saral nazar aate hai

 ' imran taahir se mulaaqaat kaa mauqaa mila to unke khel ke saath unki shaksiyat ko samajhane ko lekar bhi badi jigyaasa thi
 Imran is an amazing personality ek gendbaaz jo pakistan main bada hua or vahiin cricket sikhi, naakaam hokar england pahunchaa, vahaan ek dakshin africa ladki se pyaar hua to usase shaadi kar dakshin africa pahunchaa, or protiyaaz ke liye test or vishwa cap khilne main kaamyaab hua or fir ipel main ab bharat main jaadu bikher rahaa he
 Imran's story is a spice of Bollywood
 lekin imran lagaataar sangharsh se lekar kamyaabi ke safar ko anjaam dete nazar aate hai
 It was interesting to meet Imran who stayed at a five-star hotel in Delhi
 vahaan pahunch kar phone kiya to imran ne kaha 'bhaiya bas abhi aa rahaa hum
 'imran came out of the elevator with a phone on his ear, then met directly as if he had known this reporter for a long time
 hairaani tab hui jab unhone bataaya ki desh ke kai bade cricket reportron se milane ke baavjood test or vanade sahit first class cricket main 800 se zyaada wicket (test 43, vanade 59, first class cricket 711 wicket) lenevaale is gendbaaz kaa ipel-8 main kisi bhi tivi patrkaar se ye pehali mulaaqaat he
 Seeing Imran also felt like seeing the cameras and other frills, players often abstain from TV people
 imran taahir se pehla sawaal leg spin ke bare main poocha to unhone badi bebaaki se kaha ki leg-spinner yaa to aapako match jitate hai, yaa match haraate hai
 Then the question asked him about the way to celebrate by thumping his chest and laughed in his face
 unhone ek lambii saans lekar kaha, 'badi mehnat se yahaan pahunchaa hum to jashn kyon na manaauun? main kuch sochataa nahin hum, bas apane cricket kaa lutf uthaa rahun hum
 ' imran thik kehete hai
 After playing under-19 cricket for Pakistan, his career came to a standstill and like the rest of the cricketers, he turned to England to earn money
 england main wo cricket khel hi rahe the ki unki mulaakaat bhartiya mul ki sumaiya dildaar se hui jo dakshin africa main bas gai thim
 The love between the two took the form of Nikah and Imran Tahir reached South Africa
 imran ko ye maanane main bilkul bhi hichkichaahat nahin hoti ki wo aaj jo bhi kuch hai apni patni kii vajah se hai
 The comments 'hamaara ek chota betaa he or main apane kariyar ke sabase achche muqaam par hum
 i never thought that i would play Test matches or play World Cup for South Africa
 ' imran ke vyavhaar main badi saadagi nazar aati he
 If you know even a little bit, then you respond spontaneously
 jivan main jab badi noummidi ke baad agar kamyaabi milti he to yaa aap ghamandi jo jate hai yaa bilkul vinamr
 Humility is more visible in Tahir
 imran apane bure din nahin bhuule
 Nor have they forgotten those who were with them in bad times
 wo bade pyaar or aadar se apane puraani saathiyon ke ahsaan ab bhi yaad karte hai
 On the go, he spoke one thing which went home in Zehn
 imran ne kaha, 'mahavir bhai vakt acha bhi aata he or bura bhi
 But i hope that you will remember even when bad times come

 imran taahir se pehla sawaal leg spin ke bare main poocha to unhone badi bebaaki se kaha ki leg-spinner yaa to aapako match jitate hai, yaa match haraate hai
 Then the question asked him about the way to celebrate by thumping his chest and laughed in his face
 unhone ek lambii saans lekar kaha, 'badi mehnat se yahaan pahunchaa hum to jashn kyon na manaauun? main kuch sochataa nahin hum, bas apane cricket kaa lutf uthaa rahun hum

 england main wo cricket khel hi rahe the ki unki mulaakaat bhartiya mul ki sumaiya dildaar se hui jo dakshin africa main bas gai thim
 The love between the two took the form of Nikah and Imran Tahir reached South Africa
 imran ko ye maanane main bilkul bhi hichkichaahat nahin hoti ki wo aaj jo bhi kuch hai apni patni kii vajah se hai

 When asked Emraan Tahir about the first leg leg spin, he said very clearly that the leg-spinner either won you the match, or defeated the match
 phir sawaal unase chaati thokkar jashn manaane ke tareeke ke bare main poocha to unke chehre par hansi aa gai
 He took a long breath and said, 'I have come here with great effort, so why not celebrate? i don't think anything, just enjoy my cricket
 ' Imran is right

 Delhi High Court has directed 4 big hospitals of the state to deposit an amount of Rs 10 crore
 yah puraa maamla privet aspataalon dwaara garib marijon ko muft ilaaj naa die jane se judaa hua he
 In fact, the Special Committee of the Delhi Government has imposed a penalty of about 100 crore rupees on these hospitals
 privet aspataalon nehaicortmen dilli sarkaar ke isi aadesh ko chunauti di he
 But the High Court has also instructed to deposit Rs 10 crore before hearing the petition of these private hospitals

 lekin uske baavjood aspataalon ne court ke adeshon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 The Delhi government formed its own special committee in this matter and that committee imposed a penalty of about 100 crore rupees on these hospitals

 However, the intention of private hospitals is always questioned, because the beds of the poor too often put the hospital rules in the race to earn money by putting them in the general category in the hospitals, and currently the court order and the Delhi government's penalty Even after this hospital has come to challenge the government's order in the court

 There is a 3-inch IPS LCD display, which has a resolution of 2340x1080
 yahaan waterdrop noch main hi front camere kii jagah di gai he
 Talking about the display, the colors are quite vibrant and bright
 sanlite ke andar isaki visibility bhi kaaphi acchhee he
 The special thing is that there is a separate card slot here to increase its internal memory
 yani aap do sim ke saath ek memory card bhi istemaal kar sakate hai
 Software: This new smartphone of Realme Android 8
 1
 0 Orio based UI coloros 5
 2 par chalata he
 Soon Android p will be updated in it
 iske interphes kii karen to yahaan ap drower nahin he lekin aap swip kar notification hataa sakate hai
 Here you will not see much bloatware
 ek do eps preloded die gaye hai jaise petm, yusi broujar, daily hunt or amejan
 You can uninstall the rest by leaving two apps like oroaming
 yahaan ek smartscan kaa ap bhi diya gaya he, jisase aap realatime main kisi verde ko scan kar yaa photo clic kar translet kar sakate hai
 We tested it but the response was mixed
 yani har baar sahi transleshan kii ummid nahin kar sakate
 Performance: The specifications of Realme U1 are quite different as compared to Realme 2 Pro
 isamen 2
 a mediatek Helio P70 processor with 1ghz speed has been given
 ye duniya kaa pehla smartphone he, jisamen ye procesar diya gaya he
 It also has an ARM mali-g72 MP3 GPU for better image processing
 is nae procesar kii apni kuch khubiyaan hai, jinamein AI ko behatar karnaa shaamil he
 This smartphone has 3GB RAM and 4GB option
 vahiin storage ke liye bhi 32GB or 64GB kaa opshan he
 We have used 4GB RAM version
 iske overol parformens kii baat kii jaae lambey samay tak upyog karne ke baad bhi hamen yahaan koi dikkat nahin ai
 That is, open many apps, keep them in the background and do image editing, yet this phone does not get stuck
 inamen saare eps bina kisi lag se aasaani se oparate hote hai
 Also, games like PUBG can also be played in it
 yahaan bhi aapako graphics ko lekar koi samasya nahin aegi
 Talking about the battery, it is a powerhouse
 yani aap ek baar puri tarah charge karne ke baad ise regular upyog main puure 24 ghante tak chalaa sakate hai
 Camera: Now talking about the camera, the company promoted it as Selfie Pro
 isi vajah se isamen 25 megapixl selfi camere ke saath AI fitures bhi shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Here is a 25MP Sony IMX576 sensor with the image processing platform of Helio P70 in the front
 iskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 0
 yahi camera phase analock ke liye bhi kaam karata he or ye vaaki bahut fast he
 There may be only a slight problem in low-light
 selfi se clic hone vaali photose kii baat karen to yahaan aapako karact skin tone or colors milenge
 Talking about portrait mode, it definitely lacks some sharpness, but not so much that you call it bad and not at all in terms of price
 isamen selfi ke liye AI ke kai fitures saath hi dheron filters kii bhi madad aap le sakate hai
 Apart from all this you can also opt for Vivid mode which will give you more bright colors
 maine mahasoos kiya ki de lite ke alaava raat main artificial lite main bhi camere kaa parformens behtareen he
 Despite going into high-light, you will be able to click photos, you can also take help of Flash here
 lekin zyada lo-lite main diteling ko miss karenge
 On the other hand, talking about the back camera, here you will find two cameras of 13 megapixels and 2 megapixels
 saath hi yahaan bhi portret mod or Vivid mod kaa opshan milegaa
 The camera's performance in both low-light and day-light is excellent
 ham yahaan aapako sample bhi dikhaa rahe hai
 Also, when you click photos in low-light, you will see the colors correctly
 keval zyada lo-lite main lee gai photose main sharpaness or diteling miss rahegi
 But the special thing is that you will be able to click photos in low-light as well
 sample photose:faisla:realme U1 ko ham kul milakar bajet kaa olerounder kah sakate hai
 That is, battery or camera or processor, all the features in this phone are such that you will feel good in terms of price
 saath hi iskaa disple or luk bhi kaaphi impress karne vaala he
 But i think it would be right to take this phone in 3GB RAM variant, which costs Rs 11,999
 kyonki 4GB ram verient kii keemat (14,499 rupee) main aap Realme 2 Pro samet bazaar main maujuud kuch or smartfones tri kar sakate hai

 The spectacular performance of the BJP in the assembly elections of five states in a way stamped the claims of Modi wave across the country
 aise main bijepi ke is vijay rath rokane ke liye vipaksh dalon main ekajutata kii kavayad bhi jorshor se jari he or is kaam main argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav puri tanmayata se jute hai
 Recently, Lalu's efforts are being considered as the reason behind the idea of BSP supremo Mayawati joining the anti-bjp camp
 mayawati isse pehle tak aise kisi gathbandhan main shaamil hone kii baat ko khaarij karti rahi thi, jisamen samaajawaadee party bhi shaamil ho
 However, Mayawati announced at a party event on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti last month that she would not be deterred from joining hands with anti-bjp parties
 lalu ke kareebi maane jane vaale ek netaa bataate hai ki mayawati kii is elaan se do din pehle hi argedy pramukh ne unhen phone kar mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone par lambii baatcheet kii thi
 According to him, Mayawati agreed with Lalu that he should form a grand alliance with the Samajwadi Party to stop the BJP and maintain its voter base
 i just really want to save & preserve constitution, rich cultural, democratic & social fabric of this great country
 - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) May 5, 2017 While Lalu also confirmed the news that he simply wants to protect the constitution of the country, its rich culture and democratic and social fabric

 Lalu also said earlier that if Mayawati and Mulayam become one in UP, then the entire game of BJP will be over there
 upi main mayawati or mulaayam ek ho jaaen
 We are one in Bihar, the entire spectacle of BJP will end
 ab ye vikaas kii baat nahi karte
 - Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) March 26, 2017 Although this could not be done before the UP elections and the BJP formed the government in UP with a strong majority
 upi main bijepi ko mili is baari jeet ne vipakshi dhade main or khalabali machaa di
 However, SP President Akhilesh Yadav does not appear to be as optimistic about the grand alliance with the BSP
 'panchayat ajtak' kaarykram main akhileshse jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki upi main kuch log mahagathbandhan hone nahin denge
 Akhilesh said, 'it has to be seen who broke the alliance between SP and BSP? Those forces will not allow SP and BSP to unite
 ' Navjot Singh Sidhu, who quit as minister due to resentment in Punjab's Captain Amarinder government, is trying to return to BJP? These speculations were reinforced by a statement in the media of BJP vice-president Harjit Singh Grewal in Punjab
 ek media reports main unke hawaale se kathith taur par kaha gaya ki congress main mantri pad chhodane ke baad se siddhu phir se bijepi main aana chaahate hai
 In this connection, he has also met a party leader in Delhi, but he is not ready to take the party
 is masale par Aajtak
 Talking to in, senior BJP leader Harjit Singh Grewal said that all doors of Navjot Singh Sidhu's return to BJP have been closed
 agar vah party main vaapasi karnaa bhi chahenge to party unke naam par vichaar nahin karegi
 Grewal says, "sidhu wanted the BJP to break the alliance and contest elections
 bhala yah kaise sambhav ho saktaa he
 The Before and after leaving the party, Sidhu said a lot of ridiculous things about the party
 aise main unhen bijepi nahin legi
 "on this issue, Punjab BJP spokesperson Naveen Singla says that the state leadership has not received any proposal to return Sidhu
 is masale par jo bhi nirnay hoga, vah kendriya netritv ke str se hi hoga
 He joined the Congress during the Punjab assembly elections in 2017 due to his displeasure with the BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii jeet ke baad captain amarinder singh sarkaar main vah mantri bane
 On June 6, his department was changed by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in the order of Ferdbal
 kaha jaataa he ki isse naaraaz hokar unhone padbhaar grahan karne kii jagah sidhe istipha de diya tha
 At the same time, his relationship with Captain Amarinder Singh was not smooth since the election
 donon netaaon kii ore se kai maukon par ek duusare ke khilaaf nishaanaa saadhaa jaataa rahaa
 After the Lok Sabha elections, Captain Amarinder Singh blamed Navjot Singh Sidhu
 kaha tha ki agar siddhu pakistan jaakar vahaan ke sena pramukh ko gale na lagaate to or siten milteen
 Let us know that Navjot Singh Sidhu was a Lok Sabha MP on BJP ticket from Amritsar seat from 2004, 2007 and 2009
 magar 2014 main jab unki jagah amritsar se arun jetali ko bijepi ne utaara tha vah is kadar naaraaz hue ki baad main 2016 main congress kii sharan main chale gaye
 However, the BJP sent him to the Rajya Sabha to vent his anger

 Water crisis is also becoming a serious challenge for India
 niti ayog kii ek report ke mutabik, saal 2020 tak 21 bhartiya shaharon main bhoojal samaapt ho jayega
 In such a situation, the initiative to make sea water potable in Odisha can become a precedent
 darasal, 15 july ko rajya ke paradeep main samudr ke khaare pani ko peyajal main parivartit karne ke liye plant lagane ke samjhaute par dastakhat hue
 In fact, Odisha is one of the states from which the Central Government has introduced the technology to make seawater potable to overcome the water crisis
 rajya ke paradeep bandargah main pehla das emeldi pratidin yani ek karod litre samudri pani ko roj pine yogya banane kii kshamta vaala atyaadhunik plant lagaaya janaa ab pakkaa ho gaya he
 After its success, this project will be expanded further
 odisha main aisa hi ek payalat plant bhabha atomic research centre ne ganjam jile ke gopalpur samudratat par lagaaya he
 An agreement was signed between Paradip Port Trust and National Institute of Ocean Technology Chennai on 15 July to set up this plant at Paradip
 paradeep bandargah ke mukhya abhiyantaa ramchandra raay or oshan technology ke project diarector emvi kairana murti ne is samjhauta patr par dastakhat kiye
 Groundwater in metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Goa is in a state of exhaustion

 Graphene is a thin strip-like element of graphite, which can be easily prepared in the laboratory

 With the fall of the 14-month-old congress-jds coalition government led by Kumaraswamy on Tuesday, the path has been cleared for the formation of a BJP government in Karnataka
 isi ke saath karnataka kaa mukhyamantri banane kii bies yediurppa kii mahatvakanksha bhi aakhirkaar puri hone ke asaar ek baar phir ban gaye hai
 However, given the political history of Karnataka, it seems that Yeddyurappa's political journey will not be easy
 darasal bijepi haikaman shuru se hi karnataka sarkaar ko giraane ke liye jimmedaar nahin bananaa chahta tha
 That is why there was no haste in the whole matter
 bijepi chaahati thi ki congress-jedies sarkaar khud hi gir jaae or uskaa haath saaf rahe
 Due to the desire of BS Yeddyurappa all the bets and punches were adopted and finally the Kumaraswamy government fell
 karnataka ke bijepi adhyaksh bies yediurppa ke chauthi baar mukhyamantri banane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 He wants to become the Chief Minister during this assembly term
 ve yah jaanate hai ki abhi nahin, to kabhi nahin
 The important reason behind this is Yeddyurappa's age
 ve 76 saal ke ho chuke hai or ve yah nahin jaanate ki agle vidhansabha chunaav main unhen bijepi tikat degi yaa nahin
 This cannot be said clearly
 darasal bijepi main niyam he ki 75 saal se adhik aayu ke netaa ko kisi bhi chunaav kaa tikat nahin diya jayega
 The meaning is clear, if Yeddyurappa is not able to become the Chief Minister now, then even the CM will not be able to become a distant MLA in future
 unke liye yahi antim mauka he jise ve khona nahin chaahate hai
 Soon after the motion of no confidence in the Assembly, BS Yeddyurappa announced the leadership of the state government
 haalanki, agar jamini str par dekhen to yah itnaa bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 Because in order to get a majority in the assembly with 224 numbers, 113 should be there
 maujuuda samay main bijepi ke paas 105 vidhayak hai
 However, BS Yeddyurappa was sworn in as Chief Minister in the month of May after the Karnataka assembly elections last year
 lekin, bahumat sabit karne main asafal rahane ke kaaran dhai din baad hi unhen pad chhodana padaa tha
 Now the hour of his becoming Chief Minister is again seen
 haalanki bijepi kaa sheersh netritv philhal supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 13 Congress and 3 JDS mlas have resigned
 aise main agar vidhansabha adhyaksh unhen sweekaar kar lete hai yaa phir unhen ayogy ghoshit kar detaa he
 If the resignation is accepted in this way, then the way to contest again will be cleared, but if they are disqualified then their chances of contesting the election will be over
 haalanki agar karnataka main bijepi sarkaar banati he or upachunaav hote hai to koi dikkat nahin hogi
 If even in the by-elections, the congress-jds coalition contests together and the result goes in their favor, then political turmoil will begin
 aise main yediurppa kaa safar kaanton bharaa hoga or sarkaar bhi dagamagaati rahegi
 Congress leader DK Shivakumar has also indicated this
 sivakumar ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main kaha tha ki baagi vidhayakon ne meri peeth main chaaku ghonpa he, lekin chintaa mat karo wo bijepi waalon ke saath bhi aisa karenge
 i am telling you that those people will not be able to become ministers
 unhone kaha ki jab main baagi vidhayakon se milane mumbai gaya to unhone mujhe kaha ki ham yahaan se janaa chaahate hai
 It seems that an atmosphere is being created to declare Narendra Modi as the PM candidate
 isiilie narendra modi mahakumbh main ja rahe hai
 Although the date is not fixed yet, it is believed that Modi will go to Kumbh after 7 February
 mahakumbh main 7 farvari ko sant samaaj kii baithak he
 It is believed that the saint community can take a big decision in this meeting
 is bich, khabar ye bhi he ki bijepi modi ko parliamentry board main shaamil karne kii kavayad main bhi juty he
 So that it can be stood at the national level
 is maamle main modi ko sangh or sant samaaj kaa aashirwad pehle se hi mila hua he
 The atmosphere is being prepared for Modi in BJP
 lekin modi kii raah main kaante bhi kam nahin hai
 Not all parties in the NDA alliance agree on Modi's name
 jediu or shivasena ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki modi ke naam par unhen etraj he
 Obviously, it will not be easy for Modi to persuade both parties

 desh main teen dashak baad prachand bahumat se narendra modi kii aguwai main sarkaar bani
 Public expectations were high on Parwan
 modi sarkaar ne janata ko aise sapane dikhaaen ki logon ko laga ki vaaki achche din ab dur nahin
 After the completion of one year of Modi government, the biggest question is whether good days have come
 modi ne jo sabase bade vaade kiye the unamem pramukh the aatankwaad ko muhthod jawaab dena or mahilaon ke prati hone vaale aparaadhon main kami laana
 Now that the government has completed one year of its tenure, the people feel cheated
 na seemaa paar se aatank kii supplai main koi kami ai na hi ghuspaith main
 The extent was reached when a minister of the government itself gave a statement that the Indian government did not know about Dawood Ibrahim's whereabouts
 is masale par sarkaar kii khub chhichhaledar hui jiske baad grih mantri rajnath singh ne sansad main bayaan diya ki daaud pakistan main hi he or ham use har haalat main waapas laane par patibaddh hai
 In the matter of women safety too, one year of Modi government was not much
 mahilaon ke prati hamale or rape kii ghatnaon main koi kami nahin ai
 The government definitely started the Himmat app, but it could not move much beyond rituals
 mahilaon kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye modi sarkaar se sakht kadam uthaane kii ummid karne waalon ke haath niraashaa hi lagi he
 The first year of the Modi government has been less than expected, but public confidence in the government's intentions remains

 Because of this, both were ordered to stay apart

 The issue of removing Section 370 has become a sore throat of the BJP in the Kashmir Assembly elections
 haalat yah he ki is mudde ko ghoshnaptr main shaamil karne or dhara 370 se kisi bhi tarah kii chhedchhad ko lekar bhaajapa ke kashmir se maidan main utarane vaale ummidavaar hi virodh main uth khadey hue hai
 One candidate even threatened to pick up the gun
 jammu-kashmir main mishan 44 ko lekar bhartiya janata party ke agenda main dhara 370 bhi shaamil he
 But now on this agenda, Sir Futtwal is seen in the party
 jammu kashmir chunaav main party kaa cheharaa ban chukin da hina bat ne is puure maamle main ek vivaadaaspad or chaunkaane vaala bayaan dekar party ko duvidha main daal diya he
 Hina Butt has said that if Section 370 is removed, she can also pick up a gun
 unka kahana he ki kashmir kii pahchaan ke liye dhara 370 jaruri he, agar is dhara ko hataaya jaataa he to hamaari pahchaan hi mit jaaegi or yah hamen manjuur nahin he
 Let me tell you that Hina Butt is a BJP candidate from Amirakdal Assembly Constituency of Srinagar
 hina kaa kahana he ki ghati main kuch log bina baat ke dhara 370 ko lekar vivaad paidaa karne main lage hue hai
 Butt said that when the election manifesto of our party mentions its removal? i have not seen any such manifesto and if anyone has seen it, bring it before me
 bat ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii kashmir main lagaataar bad rahi lokapriyata se hamaare virdohi hataash ho chuke hai
 The same people are making claims regarding removal of Article 370
 bat ne kaha ki bhaajapa kii kashmir main lokapriyata se hamaare virdohi baukhalaaye hue hai
 Says Hina, "we are working day and night to execute Mission 44 in the Valley, but there is no talk of Section 370, nor is there any intention of tampering with it
" ' He said that Section 370 is an issue related to the feelings of the people of this place, if this section is removed then she will leave the BJP
 unhone kaha ki dhara 370 hataae jane kaa vah khulkar virodh karengi
 Now in such a situation, the question arises that how many seats will the BJP be able to win in the 46 seats of Kashmir in such a situation, at present, there is not a single seat in this area and here the BJP neither has a big name nor the village of the Sangh- Cooperation spread to the village
 kehane ko sajaad lone jaise algaavvaadi netaa khulkar modi kii tarif kar rahe hai par ye apni hi seat nikaal len to badi baat hogi
 At the same time, BJP has 11 seats out of 41 seats in Jammu, out of which 7 people have already cheated the party
 gauratlab he ki kuch din pehle kendriya mantri jitendra singh ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa ke chunavi ghoshnaptr main dhara 370 ko hataae jane kaa zikr kiya jayega
 Analysts believe that the work of stopping Modi's Vijay Rath is not being done by all the parties including Congress, it should not do Section 370 and Modi's Vijay Rath should not stop coming to Kashmir

 ' Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised the world by suddenly going from Kabul to Lahore
 ab pataa chalaa he ki yah daura baqayada pakistan sarkaar kii ore se suraksha kaa bharosa die jane ke baad tay hua tha
 It was already decided that after landing at Lahore Airport, Modi would accompany his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in a helicopter to Jatti Umra
 kaise bana lahore daure kaa kaarykramis yatra ke peeche kaa kissa kuch yun he ki modi ne jab sharif ko janmdin kii badhai dene ke liye phone kiya to sharif ne kaha- sharif ne modi ko pakistan aane kaa nyotaa diya or kaha ki unhen bhi mehmaannawaaji kaa mauka diya jaae
 Sharif was then in Lahore for his granddaughter's wedding
 unhen lahore hi bula liya
 Modi also agreed
 lekin espiji ke liye suraksha sabase badi chintaa thi
 To assure India of security, Pakistan decided that Sharif and Modi would go to Jatti Umrah in the same helicopter
 behad ahm thi wo do coldonon pradhanmantriyon ke daure se jude adhikariyon ne pahchaan jaahir na karne kii shart par angreji akhbaar da iconomic times ko bataaya ki donon deshon ke suraksha adhikariyon ke bich achaanak hone vaale is daure ko lekar do baar phone par baat hui
 After these two phone calls, security was assured and it was decided to stop for a while in Lahore and leave for Delhi
 iske baad hi modi ne twit kar lahore jane kaa elaan kiya
 Lahore tour was nothing short of a challenge According to security officials, arranging for the PM to go to Lahore suddenly was no less than a challenge for the SPG
 kyonki islamabad main achaanak yatra ke liye paryaapt intjaam hai
 There is an institutionalized security protocol and complete set up for VVIP travel
 lekin lahore main is tarah kaa koi set ap nahin he
 Because of this, pm's safety was the biggest concern for SPG
 lekin jab pakistan kii ore se suraksha kaa bharosa dilaayaa gaya to daura mukammal ho paaya
 Sharif had welcomed Modi at the Lahore airport, Sharif himself came to welcome Modi
 iske baad donon deshon ke netaa pakistan airforce ke helicopter se jetty umara ke liye ravaanaa hue
 The safety of both of them going by the same helicopter was sure that the Prime Minister is not a threat of any kind
 modi lahore airport se sharif ke ghar raivind pales gaye the or yahaan unki nathin ko aashirwad diya tha
 Then Modi even touched Sharif's mother's feet and took his blessings
 is daure kii duniya ne kii tarifmodi ke is daure kii puri duniya ne tarif kii thi
 The Pakistani media had dubbed it Modi's diplomatic masterstroke
 beete ek dashak main kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa yah pehla pakistan daura tha
 Before Modi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited there in 2004
 modi kii mehmaannawaaji main sharif ne unka manapsand saag bhi banwaaya tha
 After this Sharif, his granddaughter Dawate Valima, wore the same turban that Modi had gifted him

 If someone has already taken such a plan, then why would he buy it again
 kahin aisa to nahin ki is badlaav ke zariye insurance sector kaa khajaana bharaa ja rahaa he
 Why will the government decide where to give the money we get after retirement
 wo vikalp de, kanoonee rup se majaboor na karen
 If the government is so worried about your pension, then the pension is part of the EPFO itself, why not make it bigger
 aap jaanate hai ki ipiefo ke teen hisse hote hai
 You give 12% of the basic, the same company gives
 company ke 12 fisadi main se 3
 67% goes to pension, which you get, but this amount is very less
 agar sarkaar kaa iraadaa pension badhanaa he to saath fisadi paise ko bazaar main laane kii bajaay ipiefo ke pension fund main hi kyon nahin daal detii
 Do we know about the super annuity plan of the insurance companies for which we have imposed tax on our hard earned income, what will be their conditions, what will be their provisions
 kya aap jaanate hai
 The statement of Secretary of State for Revenue, Press Release and Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said that there will be no tax on withdrawal of money from PPF, but whether the government will announce it while passing the budget
 ab aapako enpies kii maujuuda shart ke bare main bataata hum
 It is written in the booklet of NPS that when you are sixty years old, you will have to invest at least 40% of your total pension amount in annuity plan
 agar saath saal se pehle nikaalenge to 80 fisadi anyuity plan main lagaana hoga
 Forty percent is already there
 to kya sarkaar ne anyuity main paisa lagane kaa enpies kaa kota 40 se 60 fisadi kar diya he
 Let us know to understand the super annuity plan
 anyuity kaa matlab aap ek baar paisa daal den or use vritti ke aadhaar par yani maheene yaa saal ke aadhaar par mil saktaa he, tankhwaah kii tarah
 Many companies are offering annuity plans but Life Insurance Corporation of India has two policies
 jivan akshay 6 or jivan nidhi
 Finance Minister Jayant Sinha elaborated that you will have to pay tax because we are trying to give you such a big tax break
 
 
 agar aap ritairement inakam kaa prayog nahin karte hai to aapako tex dena padegaa
 
 
 When we brought this proposal in the Finance Bill, many suggestions came
 
 
 ham log us par vichaar kar rahe hai
 
 
 Make changes that would be appropriate
 
 
 magar aaj ye lagu hoga
 
 
 The comments yani ye faisla lagu hoga
 By the way, we have not read his entire statement
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karenge ki agar company kaa hissaa jo pehle 12 fisadi hota tha use dedh lakh rupee tak simit karne se laabh kisko hoga, nuksaan kisko hoga
 So is the new change really related to 70 lakh people, then it will not be interesting to know how much tax the government will get from these 70 lakh people
 is faisle kaa virodh karne vaale kehete hai ki selary par tex to sab dete hi hai
 Taxing EPFO means paying tax again
 vaise bhi byaaz dar kabhi 12 fisadi thi jo aath se saadhe aath ke bich rahati he
 Should it not be considered a deficiency? byaaj ko lekar bhi kai tarah ke bayaan aae
 The budget said that sixty percent of the portion would be taxed
 phir kaha gaya ki us saath fisadi main jo byaaj kaa hissaa hoga us par tex lagegaa
 By the way, the amount of interest is also not reduced
 us par bhi tex lagane se aapako lakhon rupee dene honge
 The EPFO has been in operation since 1952
 2016 main sarkaar is nattejey par kaise pahunchi ki isaki nikasi ke saath fisadi hisse par tex lagaana chahie yaa ise beemaa sector kii taraf dhakel dena chahie
 An information and a hand is engaged
 ham ipiefo kii site par gaye the
 There was a notification of 25 February according to which the government has made a big change before the budget
 pehle 55 saal kii umr hote hi karmchaaree kabhi bhi paisa nikaal saktaa tha, yani 55 saal vaale ko naukari chhootane ke baad do maheene kaa intazaar nahin karnaa hota tha
 The relaxation of two months' waiting in the new notification is now given at 58 years
 55 saal se pehle jab karmchaaree paisa nikaalata tha to apana or company kaa hissaa nikaal saktaa tha
 Interest earned on both could also be withdrawn, but according to the new notification, if you withdraw money before 58 years, then the employee will get his share and only from that interest
 company yaa niyokta kaa hissaa or us par mila byaaj 58 saal ke baad milegaa
 If you are confident of EPF money then at least you should know these things
 sarkaar ipief ke paise par pratibandh se lekar nivesh kii sharten kyon thope rahi he
 But less than twenty four hours later, the Revenue Secretary started stating that PPF was not included in the scheme
 rajasav sachiv ne yah bhi bataaya tha ki ab niyokta yani naukari dene vaale karmchaaree ke ipief main dedh lakh se zyaada nahin denge
 Employer's contribution to EPF is limited to 1
5 lakhs
 yah bhi saaf kiya tha ki 1 april 2016 se pehle kii jamaa raashi par nayaa niyam lagu nahin hoga
 The Revenue Secretary also said this and he also said on Monday that EPF was made for employees whose income was Rs 15,000 a month
 baad main isamen nijee companiyon ke yogadan ko bhi shaamil kar liya gaya, jinaki selary 15,000 rupee hai unhen paisa nikaalte vakt tex nahin dena hoga
 The question is, what will happen if the salary of 15,000 gets increased
 zaahir he badhegi hi
 Is it not so that in the matter of explaining, the officers have confused the matter
 aaj sarkaar ne jo press relies jari kii he, usamen bhi 15,000 vaali baat he
 By the way, PF seems to be basic not according to salary
 kitne log aise hai jo implai provident fund argenizeshan ipiefo ke sadsy hai
 The press release states that approximately 3 of the EPFO
 7 karod sadasyon main se qareeb 3 karod aise hi sadsy hai
 
 
 
 yani kareeb 3 karod sadsy 15,000 vetan paane vaale hai
 Those who do not have to pay tax while withdrawing money
 EPFO main nijee kshetra ke kareeb 60 lakh sadsy aise hai jinaki tankhwaah zyaada he
 People of this class will now have to pay tax
 EPFO ke sadasyon ko lekar do tarah ke aankade hai
 The press release states that 3
 7 karod sadsy hai
 Sources reveal that the number of members is more than 6 crore, which the KYC organization has
 'iconomik times' ne paanch karod se zyaada sadsy bataaye hai
 According to the 'business Standard' newspaper, the number of members is around 60 million
 ab akhabaaron kii sankhya zyaada he yaa sarkaar kii sankhya kam, isaki jaankaree ke liye artiai kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa yaa koi saansad sansad main yah sawaal puch le
 In the budget and later, the Revenue Secretary had said that there will be no tax on putting sixty percent of the share from EPFO and PPF in the Super Annuity Scheme, but when the pension is received, it will be taxed
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki jab is 60 fisadi paise ko anyuity main rakhaa jayega to koi tex nahin lagegaa or tab aapkaa puraa fund tex free ho jayega
 It was said earlier that the amount received as pension after putting it in super annuity will be taxed
 ab kaha ja rahaa he ki raashi par tex nahin lagegaa
 Now you understand one more thing
 sarkaar kahati he ki saath fisadi hissaa agar super anyuity main nahin lagaayenge to hi tex dena hoga
 If you buy an insurance policy, you will not have to pay
 sarkaar beemaa companiyon ke liye karmchaariyon par tex laga rahi he yaa hamaare bhale ke liye
 During the job, the insurance policy that the employee keeps buying at a premium of five-ten thousand, we will buy a policy of the same by giving lakhs of rupees after retiring
 agar kisi ne pehle se hi aisa plan le rakhaa ho to wo dobaaraa kyon kharidega
 Is it not that through this change, the treasury of the insurance sector is being filled
 sarkaar kyon tay karegi ki ritairement ke baad milane vaale paise ko hamen kahaan dena he
 Give that option, do not force it legally
 agar sarkaar aapke pension ko lekar itani hi chintit he to ipiefo main hi pension kaa hissaa he, use hi kyon nahin bada kar detii he
 You know that EPFO has three parts
 basic kaa 12 fisadi aap dete hai, itnaa hi company detii he
 3 out of 12 per cent of the company
 67 fisadi pension main chalaa jaataa he, jo aapako miltaa he, lekin yah raashi bahut kam hoti he
 If the government intends to increase the pension, then instead of bringing sixty percent of the money into the market, why not put it in the pension fund of EPFO itself
 sarkaar ne beemaa companiyon ke jis super anyuiti plan ke liye hamaari gadhi kamai par jo tex lagaaya he kya ham uske bare main jaanate hai, unki kya sharten hongi, unke kya praavdhaan honge
 Do you know
 rajasav sachiv, press relies or vitt rajya mantri jayant sinha ke bayaan main kaha gaya he ki pipief se paisa nikaalane par kisi tarah kaa tex nahin lagegaa, lekin kya iskaa elaan sarkaar bajet paas karaate vakt karegi
 Let me tell you the current condition of NPS
 enpies ke bocolate main likhaa he ki jab aap saath saal ke honge to aapako apni kul jamaa pension raashi kaa kam se kam 40 fisadi anyuity plan main lagaana hoga
 If you withdraw before sixty years, then 80% of the annuity plan will have to be invested
 chalis fisadi to pehle se hi he
 So has the government reduced the NPS quota of 40 to 60 per cent to invest in annuities
 super aneuity plan samajhane ke liye aapako bataa den
 Annuity means you put money once and it can be received on the basis of profession, on the basis of month or year, like salary
 bahut sari companiyaan anyuity plan laa rahi hai lekin bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam kii do policy hai
 Jeevan Akshay 6 and Jeevan Nidhi
 vitt mantri jayant sinha ne vistaar se bataate hue kaha ki tex aapako isliye dena padegaa kyonki hamaari koshish he ki agar ham aapako itnaa bada tex brake de rahe hai
 
 
 If you do not use the retirement income then you will have to pay tax
 
 
 jab finance bill main ham logon ne ye prastaav laayaa to bahut se suzav aae
 
 
 We are considering that
 
 
 badlaav karenge jo uchit hoga
 
 
 But today it will be applicable
 
 
 tippaniyan This means that this decision will be applicable
 vaise hamane unka puraa bayaan nahin padhaa he
 We will also try to understand that if the share of the company which used to be 12 per cent earlier was limited to Rs 1
5 lakh who would be benefited, who would be the loss
 to kya vaaki nayaa badlaav 70 lakh logon se hi sambandhit he, to kya jaananaa dilachasp nahin hoga ki in 70 lakh logon se sarkaar ko kitna tex mil jayega
 Those opposing this decision say that they pay tax on salary at all
 ipiefo par tex lene kaa matlab he dobaaraa tex dena
 Anyway, the interest rate was once 12 per cent, which is between eight to eight and a half
 kya ise kami nahin maani jaae
 There were many statements about interest
 bajet main kaha gaya ki saath fisadi hisse par tex lagegaa
 Then it was said that interest would be taxed in that sixty percent
 vaise byaaj kii raashi bhi kam nahin hoti
 You will have to pay lakhs of rupees due to tax on that too
 1952 se ipiefo kii yojana chal rahi he
 How did the government come to the conclusion in 2016 that sixty percent of its withdrawals should be taxed or pushed towards the insurance sector
 ek jaankaree or haath lagi he
 We went to the epfo's site
 vahaan 25 farvari kaa ek notification mila jiske anusaar sarkaar ne bajet se pehle ek bada badlaav kar diya he
 Earlier, at the age of 55, the employee could withdraw money at any time, that is, the 55-year old did not have to wait for two months after leaving the job
 nae notification main do maheene ke intazaar kii chhot ab 58 saal par di gai he
 Before 55 years, when an employee withdrew money, he could withdraw part of himself and the company
 donon par milane vaala byaaj bhi nikaal saktaa tha lekin nae notification ke anusaar 58 saal se pehle paisa nikaalenge to karmchaaree ko apana hissaa or us mili byaaj main se hi paisa milegaa
 The share of the company or employer and the interest received on it will be received after 58 years
 agar aap ipief ke paise ke bharose hai to aap kam se kam in baton ko to jaan hi lijie
 Why is the government imposing restrictions on EPF money from investment conditions
 sawaal he ki 15,000 paane vaale kii selary bad gai to kya hoga
 Obviously it will increase
 kahin aisa to nahin ki samajhane ke chakkar main afasaron ne maamla ulajhaa hi diya he
 The press release that the government has issued today, also has 15,000
 vaise pief selary ke hisaab se nahin basic ke hisaab se lagata he
 How many people are members of the Employee Provident Fund Organization EPFO
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki EPFO ke qareeb 3
 Out of 7 crore members, there are approximately 3 crore such members
 
 
 
 That is, about 3 crore members are getting 15,000 salary
 jinhen paisa nikaalte vakt tex nahin dena padegaa
 The EPFO has about six million private sector members with high salaries
 is varg ke logon ko ab tex dena padegaa
 There are two types of data on members of EPFO
 press relies main kaha gaya he ki 3
 There are 7 crore members
 sutara bataate hai ki sadasyon kii sankhya 6 karod se zyada he jinaki kevaisi sanstha ke paas he
 The Economic Times has given more than 50 million members
 'bijness standard' akhbaar ke anusaar sadasyon kii sankhya kareeb chah karod he
 Now the number of newspapers is more or the number of government is less, for the information about this, you have to use RTI or any MP should ask this question in Parliament
 bajet main or baad main rajasav sachiv ne yah kaha tha ki ipiefo or pipief se jo saath fisadi hissaa he use super anyuity skim main laga dene par koi tex nahin lagegaa lekin jab pension milane lagegaa to us par tex lagegaa
 The press release states that when this 60 percent of the money will be kept in annuity, there will be no tax and then your entire fund will be tax free
 pehle kaha gaya ki super anyuiti main daalane ke baad jo pension ke rup main jo raashi milegi us par tex lagegaa
 It is now being said that the amount will not be taxed
 ab aap ek or baat samajhiye
 The government says that tax will have to be paid only if sixty percent share is not put in the super annuity
 agar beemaa policy kharid lenge to nahin dena hoga
 The government is taxing employees for insurance companies or for our good
 naukari ke dauraan karmchaaree jin beemaa polisy ko paanch-das hazaar ke premium main kharidte rahete hai usee kii ek policy ham ritair hone ke baad lakhon rupee dekar kharidenge
 If someone has already taken such a plan, then why would he buy it again
 kahin aisa to nahin ki is badlaav ke zariye insurance sector kaa khajaana bharaa ja rahaa he
 Why will the government decide where to give the money we get after retirement
 wo vikalp de, kanoonee rup se majaboor na karen
 If the government is so worried about your pension, then the pension is part of the EPFO itself, why not make it bigger
 aap jaanate hai ki ipiefo ke teen hisse hote hai

 We will also try to understand that if the share of the company which used to be 12 per cent earlier was limited to Rs 1
5 lakh who would be benefited, who would be the loss

 We went to the epfo's site
 vahaan 25 farvari kaa ek notification mila jiske anusaar sarkaar ne bajet se pehle ek bada badlaav kar diya he
 Earlier, at the age of 55, the employee could withdraw money at any time, that is, the 55-year old did not have to wait for two months after leaving the job
 nae notification main do maheene ke intazaar kii chhot ab 58 saal par di gai he
 Before 55 years, when an employee withdrew money, he could withdraw part of himself and the company
 donon par milane vaala byaaj bhi nikaal saktaa tha lekin nae notification ke anusaar 58 saal se pehle paisa nikaalenge to karmchaaree ko apana hissaa or us mili byaaj main se hi paisa milegaa
 The share of the company or employer and the interest received on it will be received after 58 years
 agar aap ipief ke paise ke bharose hai to aap kam se kam in baton ko to jaan hi lijie
 Why is the government imposing restrictions on EPF money from investment conditions
 aap jaanate hai ki ipiefo ke teen hisse hote hai
 You give 12% of the basic, the same company gives
 company ke 12 fisadi main se 3
 67% goes to pension, which you get, but this amount is very less
 agar sarkaar kaa iraadaa pension badhanaa he to saath fisadi paise ko bazaar main laane kii bajaay ipiefo ke pension fund main hi kyon nahin daal detii
 Do we know about the super annuity plan of the insurance companies for which we have imposed tax on our hard earned income, what will be their conditions, what will be their provisions
 kya aap jaanate hai
 The statement of Secretary of State for Revenue, Press Release and Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said that there will be no tax on withdrawal of money from PPF, but whether the government will announce it while passing the budget
 ab aapako enpies kii maujuuda shart ke bare main bataata hum
 It is written in the booklet of NPS that when you are sixty years old, you will have to invest at least 40% of your total pension amount in annuity plan
 agar saath saal se pehle nikaalenge to 80 fisadi anyuity plan main lagaana hoga
 Forty percent is already there
 to kya sarkaar ne anyuity main paisa lagane kaa enpies kaa kota 40 se 60 fisadi kar diya he
 Let us know to understand the super annuity plan
 anyuity kaa matlab aap ek baar paisa daal den or use vritti ke aadhaar par yani maheene yaa saal ke aadhaar par mil saktaa he, tankhwaah kii tarah
 Many companies are offering annuity plans but Life Insurance Corporation of India has two policies
 jivan akshay 6 or jivan nidhi
 Finance Minister Jayant Sinha elaborated that you will have to pay tax because we are trying to give you such a big tax break
 
 
 agar aap ritairement inakam kaa prayog nahin karte hai to aapako tex dena padegaa
 
 
 When we brought this proposal in the Finance Bill, many suggestions came
 
 
 ham log us par vichaar kar rahe hai
 
 
 Make changes that would be appropriate
 
 
 magar aaj ye lagu hoga
 
 
 The comments yani ye faisla lagu hoga
 By the way, we have not read his entire statement
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karenge ki agar company kaa hissaa jo pehle 12 fisadi hota tha use dedh lakh rupee tak simit karne se laabh kisko hoga, nuksaan kisko hoga
 So is the new change really related to 70 lakh people, then it will not be interesting to know how much tax the government will get from these 70 lakh people
 is faisle kaa virodh karne vaale kehete hai ki selary par tex to sab dete hi hai
 Taxing EPFO means paying tax again
 vaise bhi byaaz dar kabhi 12 fisadi thi jo aath se saadhe aath ke bich rahati he
 Should it not be considered a deficiency? byaaj ko lekar bhi kai tarah ke bayaan aae
 The budget said that sixty percent of the portion would be taxed
 phir kaha gaya ki us saath fisadi main jo byaaj kaa hissaa hoga us par tex lagegaa
 By the way, the amount of interest is also not reduced
 us par bhi tex lagane se aapako lakhon rupee dene honge
 The EPFO has been in operation since 1952
 2016 main sarkaar is nattejey par kaise pahunchi ki isaki nikasi ke saath fisadi hisse par tex lagaana chahie yaa ise beemaa sector kii taraf dhakel dena chahie
 An information and a hand is engaged
 ham ipiefo kii site par gaye the
 There was a notification of 25 February according to which the government has made a big change before the budget
 pehle 55 saal kii umr hote hi karmchaaree kabhi bhi paisa nikaal saktaa tha, yani 55 saal vaale ko naukari chhootane ke baad do maheene kaa intazaar nahin karnaa hota tha
 The relaxation of two months' waiting in the new notification is now given at 58 years
 55 saal se pehle jab karmchaaree paisa nikaalata tha to apana or company kaa hissaa nikaal saktaa tha
 Interest earned on both could also be withdrawn, but according to the new notification, if you withdraw money before 58 years, then the employee will get his share and only from that interest
 company yaa niyokta kaa hissaa or us par mila byaaj 58 saal ke baad milegaa
 If you are confident of EPF money then at least you should know these things
 sarkaar ipief ke paise par pratibandh se lekar nivesh kii sharten kyon thope rahi he
 Let me tell you the current condition of NPS
 enpies ke bocolate main likhaa he ki jab aap saath saal ke honge to aapako apni kul jamaa pension raashi kaa kam se kam 40 fisadi anyuity plan main lagaana hoga
 If you withdraw before sixty years, then 80% of the annuity plan will have to be invested
 chalis fisadi to pehle se hi he
 So has the government reduced the NPS quota of 40 to 60 per cent to invest in annuities
 super aneuity plan samajhane ke liye aapako bataa den
 Annuity means you put money once and it can be received on the basis of profession, on the basis of month or year, like salary
 bahut sari companiyaan anyuity plan laa rahi hai lekin bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam kii do policy hai
 Jeevan Akshay 6 and Jeevan Nidhi
 vitt mantri jayant sinha ne vistaar se bataate hue kaha ki tex aapako isliye dena padegaa kyonki hamaari koshish he ki agar ham aapako itnaa bada tex brake de rahe hai
 
 
 If you do not use the retirement income then you will have to pay tax
 
 
 jab finance bill main ham logon ne ye prastaav laayaa to bahut se suzav aae
 
 
 We are considering that
 
 
 badlaav karenge jo uchit hoga
 
 
 But today it will be applicable

 kiran bedi kii bijepi main entry kya hui, party kii rajya ikai ke netaaon kii naaraazgi saream ho gai
 After publicly expressing displeasure at Bhojpuria singer-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari and senior leader Jagdish Mukhi, BJP president Amit Shah took the post of Damage Control
 shah ne apane sipaahiyon ko turant taakid karte hue party ke nirnay ke saath chalane ko kaha
 In such a situation, it becomes interesting to know where the BJP leaders are standing after Kiran Bedi's entry
 
 Satish Upadhyay did not publicly react to the entry of Satish Upadhyakikaran Bedi
 lekin privet rup se unhone apni naaraazgi jaahir kar di
 Upadhyay feels that the decision to bring Kikiran Bedi into the party came too late, if he were to be brought into the party, it should have happened long before the elections were announced
 upaadhyaay kaa maananaa he ki party majboot prachaar abhiyaan chalaa rahi he or aam aadmi party ko haraane main kaamyaab rahegi

 Bedi's arrival is a travesty on his hopes of becoming Chief Minister
 haalanki bedi ko party main naa shaamil kiya jaataa, to unke mukhyamantri banane kii ummid bad jaati
 Officially BJP says that the party does not want to send a Union Minister to the politics of the state
 gauratlab he ki kiran bedi ke ghar par yojit tii party main harshavardhan nahin pahunche the
 However, Union Minister arrived at Bedi's house late, when she had left for public relations
 jagadish mukhiek samay aam aadmi party ke nishane par rahe jagadish mukhi ne saarvajanik rup se apni naaraazgi jataai or kaha kikiran bedi ko party main shamilkarne se pehle unase salaah nahin lee gai
 He believes that local leaders should be consulted before making such a decision
 mukhi ko lagata he ki party leadership ne sthaneey netaaon ke saath bhedbhaav kiya, jinhone rajya main party ko khadaa karne main apana amuly yogadan diya he
 Mukhi has organized campaigns to project himself as a candidate for the Chief Minister of Delhi on behalf of his supporters
