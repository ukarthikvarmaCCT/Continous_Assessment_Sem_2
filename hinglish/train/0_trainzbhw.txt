 After this, Veero used to repeatedly reach the same police station, where police officer Akeel Ahmad, on seeing him, very rarely hide his anger in a pile of files, and finally one day he took out an affidavit from that pile, and showed Veero
 
 
 
 affidavit main likhaa tha, jivati, jise dharmaparivartan ke baad fatima naam se janaa jaataa he, ne apni marzi se islam kabool kiya tha, apni marzi se hamid se shaadi kii thi
 
 
 It also wrote that she could not meet her mother because she is now a Muslim, and her original family was Hindu
 
 
 hindu kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki in ladakiyon ko uthaa le jane ke baad tab tak chhipaakar rakhaa jaataa he, jab tak unka jabaran dharmaparivartan or shaadi na kara di jaae
 
 
 And once this happens, it is no longer possible to do anything

 In sharp contrast to the claim made at the police station, he angrily denies that he raised Jeevati as a payment of debt

 a black shawl was wrapped over his head
 
 
 ankhon par baari mechap tha, honton par bhi laal rang kii lipstick kii moti parat dikh rahi thi

 i myself told him that if we both love each other, then we should get married

 Jeevati said that she does not know what is written in the court document, although the police had shown every document, claiming that all these things were said by Jeevati herself

 4 karod Uncle Sam ie America keeps an eye on the whole world, this is not a new revelation but that in 2010, he supervised the BJP or just spied it
 lekin hairat kii baat he ki usne misr kii muslim brotherhud kii bhi saath-saath nigaraanee kaa kaam kiya
 a total of five political parties around the world were monitored by its spy organization National Security Agency (NSA)
 apane pratidwandviyon yaa dushmano kii jasusi karnaa to jaij he or zyaadaatar desh aisa karte hai lekin yah to aisa maamla he jiske bare main sunakar hairaani hoti he
 The NSA has unlimited powers to spy in the US and this agency continues to do so
 vah darjanon nahin saikadon kii taadaad main sanghathanon or deshon kii jasusi karti rahati he
 Not only this, the NSA also monitors the activities of the World Bank, IMF, European Union and International Atomic Energy Agency
 yani vah har us sanghathan yaa desh kii nigaraanee karata he jisase use kuch bhi sabika ho
 The Director of National Intelligence recently reported that in 2013, the US government spied 90,000 foreign nationals and organizations
 yah koi nai baat nahin he bahut pehle se hi america agenciyaan duusare mulk ke logon or sanghathanon kii jasusi karti raheen hai
 He has got a lot of authority from the government
 2008 main to iske liye baqayda ek kanoon bhi bana diya gaya
 Since then, there has been a spying of spies
 iskaa hi nateeja he ki is tarah se khule aam dusron kii jasusi kaa bhayaavah kaam ho rahaa he
 Now the question is that by spying on others, are the American officials not violating the human rights that they are always asking for? The question is also, are they not misusing those information? The third big question is, what is the guarantee that they will not pass on that information to others? This is a very arrogant and imperialist step that America keeps taking
 nirvivaad rup se duniya kii sabase badi sainya takat banane kaa uskaa sapana kya is tarah ke kadamon se puraa hoga? apane swaarthon kii khatir america ne is tarah ke na jane kitne kadam uthaae hai
 They suspect that it is not a democratic country but a country where spy agencies like the Pentagon or CIA or NSA run, not the public
 loktantric vyavasthaaon kaa vahaan is tarah se peeche chale janaa bhayaavah sthiti he jo duniya ke har desh kii swatantraaa ko khatre main daalati he
 Now the time has come that all the countries of the world should object to the manner of Uncle Sam's peeping

 There is a general belief that more sex is better than relationships, but on the contrary, according to a research, couples who have sex once a week are relatively happier
 canada ke toronto-missisoga vishvavidhyalay kii emi moose ke anusaar, zyada se zyada sex ko khushi se joda gaya he lekin saptaah main ek baar sex sabase behatar he
 According to Moose, research findings suggest that maintaining intimate relationships with your partner is important, but there is no need to have sex daily
 haalanki pichley kai shodhon yah bataaya jaataa rahaa he ki zyada sex se zyada khushi milti he
 For the first time in four decades of research on 30,000 US citizens, it has been found that couples who have had sex on average more than once a week have seen no connection with their mutual relationships
 yah shodh soshal psychological or persenality science jarnal main prakashit kiya gaya he
 According to Moose, these findings apply equally to young or elderly couples, newly married or those who were married decades ago
 is shodh kaa makasad yah nahin he ki jode saptaah main ek baar sex ke ausat tak pahunchane ke liye kam yaa zyada sex karne lage lekin apane saathi ke saathis sambandh main baat jarur karanki kya ve unki yon jaruraton ko puraa kar paa rahe hai yaa nahin
 Maintaining an intimate relationship with your partner is important rather than having as much sex as possible

 The biggest problem of democracy is that people have to win in it
 yah jeet hi darasal vot main tabdeel hoti he
 But in recent years, politicians have been falling for direct votes
 ab uski koi misaal nahin milti
 The latest example of this is given by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa
 unhone supreme court ke faisle kaa phayda uthaane kii koshish main rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ko jail se chhodane kii ghoshnaa tak kar daali
 After the Supreme Court changed the death sentence of Rajiv Gandhi's killers to life imprisonment, Jayalalithaa made this important announcement in a hurry to gain cheap popularity
 baat saaf thi ki unhen laga ki is maamle main karunanidhi kahin baaji na maar len
 Karunanidhi is considered a supporter of LTTE and he had given a big push to the foreign policy of the UPA government by overthrowing the matter
 tamilnadu kii raajnneeti imoshans se chalati he or vahaan vikaas jaise shabd bahut myne nahin rakhte thik vaise hi jaise bengal main
 The killers are killers and these killers not only Rajiv Gandhi killed a total of 26 people
 itane saare logon kii jaan lene waalon ko jail se turant reeha karne kaa elaan karne main jayalalita ko jaraa bhi shame nahin ai
 He is worried about the votes of Sri Lankan Tamil supporters
 sansad main pichley kai dinon se telugana kaa naatak chal rahaa he

 In order to show their commitment to the public, these mps are carrying out many different acts
 inaki harakatein itani giri hui hai ki unhen dekhakar shame aati he
 They do not even care for the dignity of the democracy for which they are doing this drama
 aisa nahin he ki bharat main vot kii raajnneeti koi nai cheez he
 This has been done for years and we have had to face its consequences many times
 voton kii khatir rajanetaaon ke girane ke kai udhaaharan milte hai lekin chunaav najadik dekh kar har str ke netaa ek se ek ghatiya kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Negative news is coming from every state
 lagata he raajnneeti main eemaandaaree or shuchita ke liye jagah hi nahin bachi hui he
 Now the people will have to find a solution so that the foundation of democracy does not become hollow
 chunaav aa rahe hai or janata ko chahie ki vah rajanetaaon ke iraadon ko samaj kar hi vot den tabhi yah loktantr batch paaegaa

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhale hi narendra modi se jitani marji duuri bana len, lekin narendra modi kii party bijepi bihar main unhen jabardast nuksaan pahuchane ja rahi he
 In a survey conducted by Nielsen for a news channel, BJP has won 19 out of 40 seats in Bihar, while its partner LJP can also win 2 seats
 gauratlab he ki 2009 main hue pichley aam chunaav main bijepi ko yahaan 11 siten haath lagi thim, tab jediu or bijepi ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 But what is worrying for BJP is that in the previous survey of the same channel, BJP was projected to get more seats
 janvari main karaae gaye survey main bijepi ko 24 or farvari ke survey main party ko 21 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 The latest survey is also a matter of concern because in every survey, bjp's figure is coming down and general elections are on the head
 2009 ke aam chunaav main sirf chaar siten jeetne vaali lalu prasad yadav kii party argedy 2014 main 10 siten jeet sakati he
 The happy thing for Lalu is that in the last survey, his party was estimated to get only 5 seats
 is survey main sabase zyada chintaa kii baat jediu ke liye he kyonki 2009 main bijepi ke saath milakar chunaav ladane vaali jediu ko jahaan 20 siten mili thim vahiin 2014 main use keval 6 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 The people here are not happy with Nitish Kumar, who was separated from BJP, in the last survey conducted in February, his party was expected to get 9 seats
 congress ko lok janashakti party ko 2-2 siten mil sakati hai
 This is heartening for the LJP as they did not get a single seat in the last election, while the Congress would be disappointed with this survey
 congress ko 2009 ke pichley chunaav main 5 siten mili thim
 As a coalition, the congress-rjd is projected to get a total of 26 percent votes, according to which they can get 12 seats, while the BJP-LJP alliance is projected to get 38 percent votes, which can go to 21 seats in Choli
 
 is survey main jediu ko sirf 12 pratishat vot milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he, jise siton main tabdeel kiya jaae to wo 6 siten jeet sakati he
 Others are projected to get 24 percent of the vote and may win 1 seat

 It has been a lesson for our youth
 'aakhri ODI main in 4 dhurandharon ko plaing ilevan main mil saktaa he mauccounhone kaha,‘ham bhi is daur se gujarey hai or samay ke saath siikhe hai
 Kallis, who played bowlers like Shane Warne and Anil Kumble at their peak, has scored more than 25000 runs in international cricket
 unka maananaa he ki leg spinneron kaa saamana karne ke liye koi parfect takanic nahin he
 Kallis said, 'experience is the key

 bollywood main 'shiro' kii kalpana ke kadam rakhane ke saath hi ab namchin heroinon ko lekar aisi samasya najar aa rahi he jo aage chalakar or badi samasya ban sakati he
 The big heroes seem to be terrified of working with big heroines or they are cutting it from sharing screenspace with them for many other reasons or these heroines only want more screenspace for themselves
 jaise kuch samay priyanka chopra ke saath dekhne ko mila tha, or khabaren ai thim ki koi bhi actor unke saath kaam karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Of course, it is due to these heroines doing women-oriented films or whether they go from writing different strong roles in Bollywood to them or there are many things like rising status from Bollywood to Hollywood to keep the experienced hero away from these heroines
 She is working yaa phir ye hiroine hi kuch aise role yaa demand kar rahi hai ki unhe namchin hero kii jarurat hi nahin pad rahi
 Let's talk about some similar heroines: Priyanka Chopra, 32 years, she is more active in Hollywood than Bollywood
 unkitivi siries 'quantico' kaa sijan-2shuru ho gaya he or uski shooting main vyast hai
 She is also working in the film 'baywatch'
 unhen samay-samay par bade international manch par bade karname karte dekha ja saktaa he
 In this way, his stature has grown significantly, and in such a situation, the Bollywood stars might not want to risk working with him
 phir unki pichhali kuch filmein jaise 'jai gangaajal' or 'mairi kaum' heroin pradhan filmein thim
 In this way, while his Guddi is kissing the sky in Hollywood, he should not worry much about Bollywood, then he has also taken a step towards securing his future by becoming a producer
 vidya baalan, 38 varshavidya baalan bollywood main 'shiro' kii kalpana ko sthapit karne vaali heroin hai
 Her record has been that the film in which she has been without bin hero has created panic at the box office
 phir vah chaahe kahani ho yaa phir darty pikchar
 Now his upcoming films 'kahaani-2', 'begum Jaan' and 'kavitri Kamaladas' are also such biopics
 unhone jab bhi kisi hero ke saath kaam karne yaa kuch nayaa karne kii koshishi kii, ve apana jalawaa nahin bikher sakin
 Be it the film 'teen', 'ghanachakkar' or 'our incomplete story'
 ab unhone apane niyati kii gale laga liya he, isliye unka focus byopic or stri pradhan kairactor vaali filmon kii ore ho gaya he
 Kangana Ranot, 29 years old, has a special identity in Bollywood due to her boldness and distinct choice of characters, and that is why she is a three-time National Award (best Supporting Actress for Fashion (2008))
 queen (2014) or tanu vaids manu riterns (2015) ke liye best actress) bhi jeet chuki hai
 When working with a heroine with such achievements, the hero will be left sweating
 phir jab bhi inhone hero ke saath milakar kuch alag karne kii koshish kii he, munh kii khaani padi he
 Like 'katti Batti'
 kanganaki aane vaali filmon 'simran' or 'rangoon' main unka role solid he
 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, 42-year-old daughter-in-law of the family, made her Bollywood comeback in 2015 with 'jazbaa'
 film mahila pradhan thi
 Though Irrfan was there to accompany him but he was also in the character role, and the entire command of the film was in the hands of Aishwarya
 phir unhone 'sarbajit' kii
 In this too, the story was of Sarabjit, but the entire film was focused on the sister of 'sarabjit' and Aishwarya Rai played this role
 ab 'i dil he mushkil' main vah ranbir kapur ke saath najar aa rahi hai, or ve yah kahati najar aa rahi hai, 'main kisi kii jarurat nahin khwaahish bananaa chaahati hum
 
 
 "and he is in bold style with Ranbir
 is tarah unke kairactor ko samajha ja saktaa he
 In this way she wants to establish herself through her characters, and would not want to see other heroes in front of her in such roles
 deepika padukon, 30 varshhaalankidipika padukonki bollywood main kaaphi demand he or vah hollywood main vin dijal ke saath bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 But some previous films like 'piku', 'bajirao Mastani' indicate that Deepika seems to be overshadowing the hero in terms of role
 vah is tarah ke role chun rahi hai, jinamein vah kinhin bhi myanon main kam na rahen
 He is also in the lead role in his upcoming film 'padmavati'
 is film ke liye kai logon kaa naam saamne aayaa, lekin yah khabaren bhi ain ki starcast ke chayan mendipikaca dakhal tha
 Then it should not be forgotten that she is doing most of the films with her friend Ranveer Singh
 bollywood actor saf ali khan or karina kapur khan ke bete taimur ali khan soshal media senceshan bane hue hai
 His pictures are very viral on social media
 taimur game khilne nikalen yaa apane mummy papa ke saath outing par, unhen unke phans kaa puraa atension miltaa he
 However, recently, Timur was in the headlines not because of any game but because of his t-shirt
 darasal mumbai main loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan taimur ali khan kii ek tasviir soshal media par teji se viral hui
 The picture was taken when Kareena Kapoor Khan went out to vote with her son Taimur
 taimur ne us roj orange color kii tishart pahani hui thi or hare rang ke shorts
 But the thing that was most noticeable in the picture going viral was the graphics made on their t-shirts
 Kareena Kapoor snapped with son # taimuralikhanas she heads to cast her vote todaypic
 twitter
 com / doyapsijl6— Kareena Kapoor Khan (@kareenaonline)april 29, 2019tasviir main taimur kii tishart par namo agen likhaa najar aa rahaa tha
 So did Timur Ali Khan go out to support PM Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party that day? The answer is no
 ye tasviir asal main photoshop kii gai thi
 The reality is revealed when the rest of the pictures of Timur are seen that day
 asal main taimur kii tishart par kuch or hi graphics bana hua he
 That is, apparently someone has photoshopped the picture of Timur for the purpose of creating an atmosphere or joking in support of the BJP and wrote Namo Again on the t-shirt
 12 may ko dilli main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi is tasviir ko share kiya ja rahaa he

 a whole gang works behind it
 darasal yah mahilaayein train main chadhate-utarate vakt, escalator par yaa phir jahaan kahin bhi mauka miltaa he, haath saaf karne se jaraa bhi nahin chookti hai
 Some members of the gang, who were arrested by the police, said that these people are especially prey to those who have bags
 zyaadaatar mahilaayein inke nishane par hoti hai
 After taking advantage of the mob and stealing the goods, they pass the goods to another woman so that they will not get anything when they are caught
 dilli police ne 15 may 2017 tak metro main chori ke 6384 or jeb katane ke 679 maamle darj kiye hai

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne punjab neshnal bank (pienbi) ghotaale kii gaharaai se jaanch kiye jane kii jarurat jataai he
 On Thursday, Mamata Banerjee also warned the Narendra Modi government that her party would not miss out on a big agitation to ensure the safety of the common man's savings money
 mamata banerjee ne twit main likhaa- ‘dekhie punjab neshnal bank main kya hua? 11,000 rupye se bada ghotaalaa

 i also wrote a letter to the Finance Minister for this but he did not consider it necessary to answer either
 ’ mamata ke mutabik unhone apana virodh jataane ke liye guuruuvaar ko centre ko phir chitthee likhi he
 Who should the artist be with- with thought, with person or with art? How should he get out of all the pressures on him? What are the conflicts within an artist that affect his art? What are the restrictions that prevent art and how to overcome it? On some such questions, the theater performance 'bandish 20 to 20,000 Hz' presents its perspective through singing art
 prastuti main hindustani sangeet main pichhali dedh sadi main hue parivartan, kalakaaron kii sthiti or bhitari raajnneeti ke prashn or bechainiyaan bahut sookshmata se ubharate hai
 The presentation also has a fine weave of contemporaneity with the past
 ‘aadyam’ pichley kuch saalon se behatar rangakarm darshakon ke saamne lekar aa rahaa he
 This year is the third year of this sequence and 'bandish 20 to 20,000 Hz' directed by Purva Naresh is the first presentation of this year in Delhi
 isse pehle bhi purva naresh ‘aadyam’ ke saath ‘ledis sangeet’ naam se ek prastuti de chuki hai
 Nautanki singer Champa Bai and meeting singer Beni remember their past and share memories of two present-day singers
 gayakon ke samay ke antar or unki pojishning se naatak kaa kathy ateet or vartmaan ke samvaad main aakaar letaa he
 It is a celebration of seventy years of independence
 champabai or benibai kaa sammaan hona he is samaaroh main in do aaj ke gayakon ko gaanaa he
 Along with all this is the disciple of Biu Munnu who is a part of his life, from his manager to the vanity ban
 is samaaroh main champabai gaanaa chaahati hai lekin nautanki gayika kii uski chhavi samaaroh kii ‘garima’ ke anukool nahin he
 Beni is a classical singer who wants to hear them all but she has left the song
 mausami nahin ga sakati kyonki vah gayaki ke mul upkaran vocal cord kii jagah electronic tamzam par nirbhar he
 Kabir wants to sing but cannot sing because his song has become a hit in the neighboring country
 padosi desh main arjeet lokapriyata ne use trols ke nishane par laa diya he
 The benefit of the organizer is not in his song, his song is not in 'rashtrahit'
 vah ‘antinational’ ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 In the midst of all this is Sarkar Babu, who keeps adapting only according to the order and is habitually disturbed, equipped with basic knowledge of whom to bow down and where to stick
 in sabake bich munnu kaa sawaal he ki fasaadi apane kaam par hai, babu apane kaam par hai, aise main kalakaar kahaan hai? The presentation reveals a historical journey of Hindustani music in which a singer like Benibai is evicted, Champabai is modest for Beni and society, despite being popular and holding on to the tune
 inke shoshan ke kai str or aayam prastuti main ubharate hai
 The singers nowadays sing with the help of artificial instruments are Kabir and Moushumi who know how to use their image and sell themselves
 inke tareeke puraane jamaane ko samaj nahin aate or puraane tareeke inako nahin suhate
 Their past is bitter, the present shiny, while there is nothing in the present for Beni, Champa and Munnu
 lekin sabake bheetar ek dar he jiskaa rang alag-alag he
 Beni fears humiliation, Champa's oblivion, Munnu's hunger
 kabir ko image kaa or mausami ko puraani pahchaan kaa
 Along with all this, what is invisible in this drama is society and power, which continues to dominate them in different forms
 kabhi angreji kanoon ke rup main, kabhi aazaadee ke baad raashtra nirmaan ke liye ucch mulyon ke rup main to kabhi soshal media ke trols ke rup main
 What is the treatment of these restrictions? naatak bataata he - apni kala ke prati patibaddhta
 Therefore, despite the cancellation of the song, they break and sing at the end of the performance
 har daur main pratirodh ko bhinn tarika izad karnaa hi padataa he
 The comments prastuti kii pariklpana kathy ko manoranjak andaaj main pesh karti he jisamen gambhirtha kahin kam nahin he
 Telling the story the stage changes fluidly in the performing space and the meeting of the left
 samay or spes ke badlaav ko pardon ke uthne-girane or drishy sajja ke maamuli badlaavon ke saath upasthit kar diya gaya he
 The light combination is simple
 prastuti main sangeet ahm he shubha mudgal kaa sangeet naatak ko adhik shravy banaata he
 The finesse and timing of the dialogues with the actors' vocals is amazing
 tanaav, hasya or vimarsh kaa santulan banane kaa jimmaa abhinaytaon anubha fatehpuria, nivedita bhargav, ipshita, danish hossain, harsh khurana, hitesh ne bakhubi sambhala he
 Purva Naresh has proved from his previous productions that Total Theater is his color language and he is proficient in balanced mixing of various elements
 unki prastuti main sampreshniyata bhi he or kathy main gaharaai bhi
 He enjoys using music to rely on the actor
 prastuti kii lambaai or ant main upadeshaatmak ho janaa prastuti kii kamajori he jise dur kiye jane kii gunjaaish he
 'adyam' has been bringing better theater in the past few years
 yah saal is silsile kaa teesraa saal he or purva naresh nirdeshit ‘bandish 20 se 20,000 hertz’ dilli main hone vaali is saal kii pehali prastuti he
 Previously, Purva Naresh has given a performance titled 'ladies Sangeet' with 'adyam'
 nautanki gayika champa bai or baithak gayika benny apane ateet ko yaad karti hai or yaaden saajha karte hai do aaj ke jamaane ke gayak
 From the singers' time differences and their positioning, the play's narrative takes shape in dialogue between the past and the present
 aazaadee ke sattar saalon kaa jashn he
 Champabai and Benibai are to be honored
 In this ceremony, these two singers of today have to sing
 in sabake saath hai baiyon kaa shagird munnu jo unke jivan kii hissaa he, unke manager se lekar venity bain tak
 Champabai wants to sing in this ceremony but her image of the gimmick singer is not compatible with the 'dignity' of the ceremony
 benny shastreey gayika hai unako sab sunanaa chaahate hai lekin vah gaanaa chhod chuki hai
 Mausami cannot sing as she relies on electronic frills instead of vocal vocal instrument vocal cords
 kabir gaanaa chahta he lekin isliye nahin ga saktaa kyonki padosi desh main uskaa gaanaa hit ho gaya he
 The popularity gained in the neighboring country has made him a target of trolls
 aayojak ko laabh uske nahin gane main he, uskaa gaanaa ‘rashtrahit’ main nahin he
 It has been declared 'antinational'
 in sabake bich he sarkari babu, jo keval aadesh ke hisaab se apana anukulan karata rahata he or adatan pareshaan he, kiske saamne jhukna he or kahaan kab akadana he, ke buniyadi gyaan se las
 Amidst all this, Munnu's question is that Fasadi is at work, Babu is at work, where are the artists? prastuti main hindustani sangeet kii aitihaasik yatra saamne aati he jisamen benibai jaisi gayika ko bedakhal kiya gaya he, champabai lokapriy hone or sur par pakad hone ke baavjood benny or samaaj ke liye hey hai, maamuli hai
 Several levels and dimensions of their exploitation emerge in the presentation
 kritrim upkarnon ke sahare gaate aajkal ke gayak kabir or mausami hai jo apni chhavi kaa istemaal karnaa or apane ko bechnaa jaanate hai
 Their methods do not understand the old age and the old ways do not suit them
 inkaa ateet katu he, vartmaan chamakdaar, jabaki benny, champa or munnu ke liye vartmaan main kuch he hi nahin
 But there is a fear within everyone whose color is different
 benny ko apmaan kaa dar he, champa ko gumnami kaa, munnu ko bhukh kaa
 The image of Kabir and the seasonal identity of the old
 in sabake saath is naatak main jo adrishy he, vah he samaaj or satta, jo nirantar inke upar haaavee he, alag-alag roopon main
 Sometimes in the form of English law, sometimes in the form of high values for nation building after independence, sometimes in the form of social media trolls
 in bandishon kaa ilaaj kya he? The play tells - commitment to his art
 isliye gane kaa kaarykram cancel hone baavjood prastuti kii samaapti main bandish todakar gaate hai
 Resistance has to be devised differently in every round
 tippaniyan The presentation hypothesis presents the story in an entertaining manner with seriousness no less
 kahani kehete hue manch parfarming spes or baiyon kii baithak main taralata se badalata he
 Changes in time and space have been introduced with slight changes in the rise and fall of the curtains and visual decor
 prakaash sangyojan saadhaaran he
 Music is important in the presentation Shubha Mudgal's music makes the play more audible
 abhinaytaon kii gayaki ke saath sanvaadon kaa chutilaapan or timming kamaal he
 Actors Anubha Fatehpuria, Nivedita Bhargava, Ipshita, Danish Hussain, Harsh Khurana, Hitesh have handled the task of balancing tension, humor and dialogue
 purva naresh ne apni pichhali prastutiyon se sabit kiya he ki total theatre unki rangabhasha he or isamen vibhinn tatwon ke santulit mishran main ve kushal hai
 There is also communicability in his presentation and depth in the narrative
 abhinayta par bharosa karte hue sangeet kaa istemaal karnaa unhen bakhubi aata he
 The length of the presentation and eventually becoming didactic is the weakness of the presentation which has the scope to be removed
 prastuti kii pariklpana kathy ko manoranjak andaaj main pesh karti he jisamen gambhirtha kahin kam nahin he
 Telling the story the stage changes fluidly in the performing space and the meeting of the left

 Purva Naresh has proved from his previous productions that Total Theater is his color language and he is proficient in balanced mixing of various elements

 He enjoys using music to rely on the actor

 ’ Book: Main Aur Mera Pakistan (hindi) Author: Imran Khan Publisher: Orient Publishingdam: 425 Rupeescover: Imran Khan is recognized as a cricketer in Hardkavardunia's largest democracy
 tej gendbaaji kaa kakehara jaanane vaala chota baccha bhi imran khan kii baat karata he
 But when Imran Khan used to play cricket in his childhood days, he aspired to play cricket in heaven
 wo parivaar ke bado se aksar ye sawaal poocha karte the ki ‘kya main jananath main cricket khel sakuunga, kya main vahaan bandook chalaa sakuunga
 The issue of playing and gunfire in paradise is confusing and Imran's politics too
 cricket ke maidan se nikalakar aspataal ke galiyare se raajnneeti main utre imran khan ke jivan kii ye pehali tasviir he
 In Imran's imagination, there is a democracy whose foundation rests on Islam
 yaa phir ek aisa loktantr jisaki phunagiyon par islam kaa paracham laharaa rahaa ho
 But Imran seems unsuccessful in defining his Islamic democracy
 islam or loktantr do alag chijen hai
 Islam is where the Prophet speaks
 vahiin loktantr main log mahatvapurn hote hai
 His election, the freedom to speak, criticize and live his way
 log apane hisaab se pahananaa, odhana chaahate he
 Whereas Islam says that you live life by default
 aise main imran kii islamic loktantr kii kalpana samaj main nahin aati he
 Perhaps one of the major reasons behind Pakistan's lame democracy is because before Imran, Pakistani rulers tried many times to land the dream of Islamic democracy
 pakistan ke vartmaan halaat ko jaanane ke baad islamic loktantr kii hakeekat samaj main aane lagati he
 Imran aims to improve the deteriorating nature of his country's politics
 taliban se baatcheet kaa samarthanmooltah angreji main likhi gai ek mahaan kicrater ke jivan kii daastaan ‘pakistan: a personal history’ ke anuvaadit sanskaran ‘main or meraa pakistan’ main imran khud apane beete hue kal kii kahani sunaate chalate he
 In this 246-page story, Imran keeps revolving around his Islamic identity and spiritual world, this creates a repeat and lasts till the end
 haalanki is dauraan bich bich main kuch aise kirdaar aate rahete he
 Who keeps handing over the key to future events to Imran
 pakistan main imran ko taliban samarthak ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 However, he blames the English media of Pakistan for this
 haal ke dinon main sharif sarkaar or taliban ke bich baatcheet kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua he
 Imran has been advocating him for a long time
 apana or apane desh kaa itihaas likhte hue imran jab taliban or alqaida ke bare main bataate he to unke shabdon ke chayan se spasht samaj aata he ki taliban ke prati imran kaa jhukaav he
 The training of tribal fighters against the Soviet Union by the US and then after a decade of waging war on these fighters is dangerous for the world or after 9 / 11 of the indirect campaign of waging US war against Muslims all over the world
 Imran has openly opposed
 iske alaava america kii samrajyavaadee nitiyon ke saamne pakistan kaa ghutane tech dena imran ko salata he
 This entire chapter binds the reader
 3A ke saath satta kaa gathjod1996 main gathit raajnneetik party taharike insaaf ko kai pareshaaniyon saamana karnaa pada
 With Imran in the center
 1997 ke chunaavon main party ko koi seat nahin mili, jabaki 2002 main ek seat mili
 However, it has been 12 years since then and many Pakistanis are looking at tehreek-e-insaf as an option
 bakaul imran pakistan main ek kahawat he ki pakistan main vahi raaj kar saktaa he jiske saath 3A ho yani allaah, army or america
 Allah is with Imran striving to give political options to the people of Pakistan but not the Army and America
 imran jis loktantr kaa khwab dekh rahe hai usamen sena kii bhoomika seemaa par he
 On the other hand, he is seen standing against America
 ye alag baat he ki jab wo apane loktantr kii baat karte he to pashchimi sansthaaon or unke secularism kii baat karte he
 At the same time, Lage Hands criticizes the Western way of life, describing their traditions and social structure as the best
 america se pehle taharike insaaf kii kamyaabi ke raste main army khadi he or kursi ke saath uski saajhedaari ko todane ke liye imran ko nai ranneeti banani hogi
 So that public confidence can be won
 jemima ke saath partnershipapathak ke nazariye se dekhe to imran kii nijee jindagi ke bare main jaanane kii ichha sabase zyada hiloren maarthi he
 The legendary cricketer of his time has written a chapter about his wife Jemima Khan
 lekin yah behad sankshipt he
 There is nothing new in this
 pathak kii dilchaspee donon ke rishte kii gaharaai main jane kii hoti he
 But on the pitch of personal life, Imran manages to save his wicket very cleverly
 ve kehete hai ki jemima ke saath unki partnership behad sulajhi raheen
 Imran Khan, who spent the first years of his life in the West, seems impressed by the political system there
 lekin cricket se sanyas lene ke baad jaise jaise vah pakistan main rahanaa shuru karte hai unamem islam, kabyli mulyon or pahanaavon ko lekar shreshthata kaa ahan paidaa hota he jise ve jaij tehraate he
 However, one thing is seen all over the world that if a person has a strong sense of his culture and values, then he is declared right-wing in his own country
 pakistan kii angreji media dwaara imran ko taliban samarthak ke rup main pesh kiye jane ke peeche yah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 The story of Imran, born five years after the independence of his country, is in fact the story of achieving one goal after another
 jinase prerana lee ja sakati he
 After achieving a milestone in cricket, the kind of fighting that Imran has shown to build a cancer hospital in the memory of his mother inspires him
 aspataal ke liye jhuggi jhopadi waalon kaa chanda dena, kariyar ke ahm daur main chotil hone ke baad vaapasi karnaa, vishwa cap main ladkadaati team ko vijeta banane vaala karishmai netritv prerit karata he
 Aiming to build his country's first cancer hospital, then a school and then two hospitals in Peshawar and Karachi, fighting all the troubles
 
 It is enough to tell what Imran has achieved in his life
 raajnneeti sang romancerajnneeti ke saath imran kaa romance rochak ban padaa he
 Nawaz Sharif keeps small details about Benazir Bhutto at the dam
 westeindies daure par navaj sharif kaa imran ko hataakar khud captaini or opening karne kaa kissa dilachasp he
 When Mudassar was equipped with Nazar pads, Thai, supporter, helmets and all security measures to face the world's fiery bowlers
 navaj pad or cap main carabian atake kaa saamana karne ke liye utaavle the
 Here, Imran was immersed in the dressing room worrying whether the ambulance was ready or not
 pathak jis imran ko jaanate he uske banisbat ‘main or meraa pakistan’ taharike insaaf ke netaa ki ek mukammal tasviir pesh karti he
 Proof mistakes are now common in books translated from another language
 ye kitaab bhi koi apwaad nahin he
 In most of the sentences, 'curry' is written instead
 jo pathak kaa swaad kharaab kar detii he
 The jewelery industry is going through a 'recession'
 isse kushal kaarigaron ke samaksh rojgaar kaa sankat paidaa ho saktaa he
 The All India Gems and Jewelry Household Council said this on Monday
 parishad ne iske saath hi aaayaatit sone par seemaa shulk kii daren kam karne or aabhushanon par jiesti kii dar ghataane kii maang kii he
 Customs duty on imported gold increased from 10 percent to 12 in the General Budget 2019-20
 5 pratishat kiya gaya tha
 The rate of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on jewelery has been fixed at three percent
 purvavarti mulya vardhit kar (waite) pranali main yah ek pratishat thi
 Council Vice Chairman Shankar Sen said, “the jewelery industry is going through a recession due to weak demand
 isse hajaaron kushal kaarigaron kaa rojgaar chhinane kaa andeshaa paidaa ho gaya he
 He said that consumer sentiment is being affected by the increase in customs duty and the current rate of GST as it has increased the prices of jewelery
 sen ne media se kaha, ‘hamaari maang he ki seemaa shulk kii dar ko 12
 Be reduced from 5 percent to 10 percent
 jiesti kii dar ko bhi ek pratishat par laayaa jaae
 He said that smuggling of gold has also increased due to higher customs duty
 noida- dilli ko jodne vaale dendi toll ko gaiyrkanoonee bataane vaali yachika par aaj dilli hycourt main sunwaayee ho sakati he

 yachika main kaha gaya he ki dendi se toll tex bina kisi adhikaar ke vasula ja rahaa he or toll ko ab radd kar diya janaa chahie
 Earlier, the toll company has been accused that its intention to make toll free is not clear
 saath hi noida athurity kii gatividhiyaan company ko laabh pahunchane kii rahi he

 Salman Khurshid, who was then Minister of State in Rao's cabinet, has mentioned this in his book "vigilant Muslim, Invisible Citizen: Understanding Islam in Indian Democracy"
 masjid dhahne ke turant baad desh ke kai bhaagon main sampradayik dange hue the
 Khurshid has said in the book that the demolition of the mosque put a question mark on law and order
 khurshid ne yaad kiya, ‘‘ chah disambar kii raat ko, main kuch kadam uthaane kaa anurodh karne ke liye rajesh payalat ke paas gaya tha kyonki sthal ke aas paas bheed nirantar badhati ja rahi thi
 He agreed that if some junior minister prepares the Prime Minister, he will go to Faizabad
 ''unhone pustak main likhaa, ‘‘main (sike) jafar sharif ke paas gaya taaki vah pradhanmantri ko kol karen
 He called and the Prime Minister told him that we should get in touch with Principal Secretary AN Verma or Home Secretary who were likely to reach Uttar Pradesh soon
 '' verma ne kuch sawaal puche or yah spasht nahin tha ki daure par turant ja sakate hai yaa nahin
 Khurshid said, "then we went back to the pilot to ask what we should do
 ghadi kii suiyaan aage bad rahi thim, sharif ke awaas par antim daur main hamen jawaab mil gaya lekin jab unhone pradhanmantri ko phir se phone kiya to vah so rahe the
 He said that the next day, the paramilitary forces removed most of the crowd from there as it seemed clear that they planned to demolish the roof

 jharkhand main jamtada jile ke rahane vaale subhash yadav shikshak hai or unhen dhanbad jile main nirsa main ek skool janaa hota he
 But for the distance that could be covered in 20 km, they have to travel around 60 km by motorcycle

 This bridge was being built between Veeragaon and Birbandia
 asal main, jharkhand main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar vikaas ke chaahe jitne daawey kare, lekin jameen par un vaadon ko hakeekat main utaarna mushkil hi lag rahaa he
 An example of this is the construction of a bridge connecting Jamtara to Dhanbad
 is pariyojna ko shuru hue ek dashak biit gaya lekin pul he ki banataa hi nahin
 The government started the construction of the longest bridge in the state of Jharkhand on the Barakar River
 is pul kii lambaai takreeban ded kilometre hone vaali thi
 Crores of rupees were also spent in this project
 lekin, kareeb poun kilometre banane ke baad saal 2008 main barsaat ke mausam main pul ke chaar pillar bah gaye
 The construction of the bridge came to a halt after the pillars flowed
 2008 ke baad ke das saal main baraakar nadi main na jane kitna pani bah gaya lekin pul nirmaan kaa kaam shuru nahin kiya ja sakaa

 Significantly, the government has assured many times that this one and a half kilometer bridge will be rebuilt and it will cost Rs 20 crore
 kii laagat aegi
 By the way, people have been forced to travel by boat in this area for the last 25 years
 das saal pehle pul nirmaan shuru hone par logon main safar kaa samay kam hone kii ummid jaagi thi
 But despite all the promises, no steps have been taken in the construction of the bridge
 is ilaake main rahane vaale logon ke saath is pul ko bhi apni kismat sanvarne ke liye rajya sarkaar kii neend tuutane kaa intjaar he

 Shaharyarne said, 'I think we have said a lot about this series and now we will not say any more
 gend ab unke paale main he or unhen tay karke hamen is siries ke bhavishya ke bare main bataanaa hoga
 In his strongest statement so far about the upcoming series and the relationship with India, the former diplomat said that the PCCBC has expressed interest in playing the game and restoring bilateral cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘main is siries par or kuch nahin kahana chahta
 But our concern is that the letter we sent to the Indian board about the series has not yet reached his government
 ’ pisibi pramukh ne kaha ki yadi bhartiya board siries se peeche hatataa he to pakistan isisi or anya sadsy board se sampark karegaa
 He said, 'this series is part of the mou between the two boards, which are signed by both the boards and we will take up this issue if needed
 ’ unhone kaha ki pakistan kaa rukh saaf he ki cricket or siyaayat ko alag rakhana chahie
 Shaharyar said, "relations between the two countries have been tense in the past as well but we have been playing cricket
 bharat ne haalanki 2007 se hamaare khilaaf test nahin khelaa he
 Now we will not run after them and now they have to take a decision and understand the importance of resumption of bilateral cricket
 ’ unhone kaha ki pakistan ne plan ‘bi’ par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he lekin abhi kamyaabi nahin mili he kyonki disambar main sirf do timen khaali he
 "there is a Zimbabwean that we have played twice this year and the other one is Bangladesh which will be masculine in our Premier League but we are also looking at other options," he said
 ’shehryaar khan ne aage kaha, ‘sirf ham hi unase khelnaa nahin chaahate balki yah bharat ke liye bhi ahm he
 The indo-pak series will greatly benefit both the boards and with this money cricket can be promoted at the ground level

 a Mumbai fast-track sessions court on Wednesday sentenced Bollywood actor Shiney Ahuja to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for raping his maid
 shaini ko yah sajaa mukademe ke dauraan peedita ke apane bayaan se palatney ke baavjood sunai gai
 Shiney's lawyer Srikanth Shivade told reporters that Judge PM Chauhan convicted the accused mainly relying on the FIR lodged in the case
 mukademe kii sunwaayee band kamare main hui isliye samvaadadaataaon ko adaalat main upasthit rahane kii ijaajat nahin di gai thi
 The court also did not accept the statement given by the maid to the court in which she said that she was not raped
 nyaayadhish ne mahasoos kiya ki usne galat sakshya diya
 Shiney was present with his wife Anupam when the verdict was delivered in court
 38 varshiya shaini ne gulabi rang kii kameez or genes pahan rakhaa tha
 According to a policeman, Shiney had tears in his eyes when the judge pronounced the verdict

 20 varshiya ladki ne adaalat main bataaya tha ki usne abhinayta ke khilaaf yah shikaayat us mahila ke ishaare par darj karai thi jisane use shaini ke awaas par naukaraani kaa kaam dilaayaa tha

 On September 3 last year, the victim identified Shiney in the court and said that she used to work as a maid at her residence, but when asked about the incident she said that she was never raped
 police ne apane 109 pannon ke aarope patr main shaini par balaatkaar karne or peedita ko galat tareeke se band karke rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In his defense, Shiney argued that he was implicated

 By the way, the fun of chattering is in those lines of Natwar Singh's thick book in which he is talking about Sonia Gandhi not becoming Prime Minister after ten years
 raajnneeti ke haashiye par dhakele ja chuke natwar singh kii media vaapasi is kitaab se ho gai he
 The politician also makes history and also becomes a historian
 vahiin footnots hota he or vahiin puraa kaa puraa chapter
 In this Natwar period of media, Natwar Singh is on the peak of morality and his character is on the rungs
 satta sambandh badalte hi lekhak or kirdaaron ke sambandh bhi badal jate hai
 In the context of this book, Sonia Gandhi also said that she too will write the book
 unhen ab aisi baton se fark nahin padataa, magar us kitaab main jawaab dengi
 Manmohan Singh did not say anything after Sanjay Baru's book, otherwise a book would have come in the market
 vaise aaj unhone kaha he ki do logon ke bich kii baat ko apane phaayde ke liye baahar nahin laana chahie
 Digvijay Singh has said that Natwar Singh's son is a BJP MLA so he has written this book
 natwar singh ne likhaa he ki kis tarah sonia gandhi nirankush or aloktantric rahi hai jabaki kisi ko research karnaa chahie ki natwar singh ne loktantric mulyon kii kitni ladaai ladi he
 When the curtain of TV will be lit with naturopathic themes, we will talk about India's stand in the WTO
 bharat ne dablyu tii o ke vyapaar sarleekaran samjhaute par dastakhat karne se manaa kar diya he
 Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that we will sign only when India is allowed to buy food grains storage and give minimum support price or else India will not sign the trade facilitation agreement
 aaj dilli main doctor pronay roy ne america ke videsh mantri jon kairi or vaanijya mantri penni pritzkar se baar baar poocha ki bharat ko anaaj jamaa karne kii zarurat padati he kyonki ham monsoon kaa bharosa nahin kar sakate
 Prices fluctuate so much that India has to stock
 lihaaza america kyon nahin bharat ko anaaj bhandaaran karne detaa he
 So Commerce Minister Penny kept avoiding the answers in a different way
 pehle kaha ki ham bharat main dotarafa baatcheet ke liye hai jabaki dablyu tii o bahupaksheeya maamla he
 We understand India, but in December, India sought four years in Bali and all the members agreed, but India has changed
 penny jor detii raheen ki yah deal bharat ke liye phydemand he
 But Doctor Roy kept asking why America does not take a clean stand
 tab videsh mantri jaan kairi ko bolnaa padaa ki disbanr main bali main yahi to qaraar hua tha ki agle chaar saalon tak bharat food security se koi chhedchhad nahin hogi
 We are not excluding food security
 kairi ne kaha ki is vakt bharat ko yah mauka nahin ganvaana chahie
 He already has four years
 kul milakar america ne is maamle main bharat ke paksh se duuri hi banaae rakhaa
 While reaching India, Penny Pritzker told PTI clearly that the results will not be good if India does not sign
 america niraash hua he
 The government which has won the election on the promise that it will ensure 50 per cent benefit to the farmers, can they take such a step
 ek tabaka chahta he ki bharat ko dastakhat kar dena chahie or doosraa chahta he ki nahin karnaa chahie
 In the Indian Express newspaper, Surjeet S
 Bhalla has opened the front in favor of the sign, while Devendra Sharma wrote an article in Dainik Jagran
 prakaash ke re ne prabhaat khabar main likhakar devendra sharma kii line lee he
 Surjit Bhalla says that due to this agreement, it will be easier to do business among many countries and consumers will get things at lower prices
 modi sarkaar congress sarkaar kii nitiyon par chalakar iskaa virodh kar rahi he
 The Trade Facilitation Agreement has nothing to do with the Food Security Act of India
 sarkaar kisaan ko sabsidi nahin degi magar garib janata ko sabsidi par anaaj de sakegi
 Some farmers benefited from this policy but not the poor consumers
 devendra sharma kaa kahana he ki bharat ko sin nahin karnaa chahie na karegaa
 India is liberalizing the farming market at its level
 sabsidi se peeche hatane kii jagah sarkari kharid ko kam karne kaa nirnay liya he
 States have been asked not to give bonus on MSP
 jaise madhyapradesh sarkaar gehun par 150 rupee prati kuntal bonus na de
 Then when the government itself is liberalizing, how can it oppose the policy of liberalization in the WTO
 vyapaar sarleekaran samjhauta isliye ho rahaa he taaki jab aap apana maal kisi duusare desh main lekar jaaen to bahut zyada lalaphitaashahee kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Just remember how during the election, Narendra Modi used to insist that the cost of business should be reduced
 minimum gavarment maxim gavarnence
 If you go to the WTO site, you will find three boxes
 bharat chahta he ki khadyann sabsidi or bhandaran ko green bakse main rakhaa jaae taaki use nae samjhaute ke baad bhi anumati jari rahe
 There is a provision of subsidy in the red box on which there is a clear ban
 pile rang ke bakse main waisi sabsidi he jise dhire-dhire kam kerani hogi
 There is a provision for giving support price and cash to farmers
 bharat main kisaanon ko bijli khaad karz muawza beemaa kii shakl main kai prakaar kii sabsidi milti he
 India cannot take a stand against it
 agar surajeet es bhalla kii baat maanakar le liya to kya parinaam honge, is par bhi baat honi chahie
 In prime time, the question is where to sign, but tell me if you had told the farmers in the election that they will end the subsidy as soon as they come
 viksit desh jab apane kisaanon ko sabsidi dete hai to ham kyon na den

 And India and China got very loving words to say to each other on 22 December, at least in terms of the relationship between the two countries, which was very close to a military confrontation after the 72-day standoff at Doklam in August
 Had reached
 jab seemaa vaarta par china ke vishesh pratinidhi yang jechi ne din bhar kii baatcheet ke liye apane bhartiya samakaksh rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal se mulaakaat kii to doklam se aage baduya agenda main sabase upar tha
 Yang was promoted to the 25-member Politburo in October
 is lihaaj se seemaa vaarta kaa 20waan daur unke liye aakhri ho saktaa he kyonki march main unki jagah koi uttaradhikari le legaa
 Officials on both sides believed that Yang's visit to Delhi became important due to the Doklam standoff
 yang apane raashtrapati shi jinping kaa sandesh lekar aae the jo unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko saunpa
 It said that both countries should aspire to be 'friends for many generations' and 'partners in revival'
 haal ke tanaav ko dekhte hue to yah kootnithik bhashaa or bhi hairaan karne vaali thi
 An Indian official said that even after all the tension of Doklam, his peaceful solution underlined that the arrangements at the right place worked
 lekin is adhikari ne yah bhi mana ki isse yah baat bhi sabit hoti he ki kaise galat samvaad takaraav kii sthiti bhi khadi kar detaa he
 The Chinese camp still maintains that they had twice informed Indian border units about their plans to construct a road near the meeting point of the three borders
 udhar bhartiya sainya sutron kaa kahana he ki maamla sirf itnaa hi nahin tha
 He says he had given verbal warnings to extend the road to the sensitive Siliguri corridor right at the mouth of the Indian border, and that too in an area that both India and Bhutan consider to be Bhutanese territory, equivalent to crossing the red line Was and China did not heed these warnings

 The Foreign Ministry says that both sides agree that peace and harmony is necessary until the final settlement of the border dispute is resolved

 On Doklam, India again made it clear to China that no road that poses a threat to India's security will be accepted
 apni taraf se china ne yah saaf kar diya he ki vah vivaadit pathaar main anyatra jahaan jaruri samajhegaa, vahaan apni tukdishaan majboot karegaa
 Hu Shisheng, a strategic expert at the China Institute for Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, said that "from this conversation it appears that both sides have placed emphasis on dialogue on front fronts so that wrong decisions on the border and deadlock like Doklam" Do not regenerate "the hotline between military headquarters has been given in-principle approval

 To increase cashless transactions, private banks charging money in the name of transaction charge is like throwing dust in the eyes of people
 nijee bainkon ne janata kii jeb se paisa nikaalane kii ek chaal chali he
 Vidyadhar Anaskar, President of Maharashtra Cooperative Banks Federation believes that this is a golden opportunity for the country's strong cooperative banks to strengthen their customer base
 maharashtra koaparative banks federation ke adhyaksh vidyadhar anaskar ne ise nijee bainkon kii ek sajeesh kaha he
 According to him, the announcement by private banks that customers will have to pay Rs 150 for each transaction after four transactions is completely wrong
 anaskar ke mutabik nijee bank aise chhipe chargees ke bharose hi munafa kamaati he
 According to Anaskar, this decision of private banks, instead of being cashless, the general public will start withdrawing sufficient cash within the given limit and keeping cash for them will be a profitable deal
 •chaar transectionke baad dedh sau rupe kaa charge sirf privet banks ne tay kiya he
 The government has no role in this decision
 sarkari bainkon ne aisi koi ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 Nor do cooperative banks have anything to do with this decision
 • nijee bainkon kaa kahana he ki ye faisla cashles tranjaction badhaane ke liye liya he lekin isamen logon kii jeb se paise nikaalane kii sajeesh he
 • People will now avoid depositing money in the bank and the trend of withdrawing more and more cash from the bank will increase
 agar kisi ko sau rupee kii zarurat he to bhi ek se do hajaar rupee nikaalnaa shuru karenge
 • Private bank has the idea of increasing its profits by withdrawing money from customers' pockets
 • nijee bank kii ye chhipi sahukaari he
 This will give them big profits
 nijee bank ke chargees dekhe to instrument chargees , minimum balance chargees , check bouns chargees ke naam se lagaae jate hai
 • Such banks do not rely on poor customers
 vahiin aise nijee bank sarkaar kii us koshish main saath nahin dete jahaan vah desh ke prayek garib aadmi ko banking ke sahare jod sake
 • Hidden Charges of these private banks is out of the ordinary man's mind
 use pataa bhi nahin chalata kaise ye bank customer se paise nikaalte he
 There is also a big difference between their declared interest rate and undisclosed interest rate
 • vidyadhar anaskar ke mutabik koaparative bainkon ko is maukey kaa phayda uthaanaa chahie or graahakon ko apane bank main aakarshith karnaa chahie
 There is no transaction charge in co-operative banks
 • vidyadhar anaskar ne daawa kiya he ki koaparative bank aise nijee banks kii tarah hiden chargees nahin lagaati or isi liye koaparative bainkon ke liye apana graahak base badhaane kaa bada mauka he

 Looking at these pictures, it is being said that Ranbir and Mahira are in a relationship
 ye tasviren neuyork kii bataai ja rahi hai
 Various things are being talked about on social media
 ranbir ke pita rishi kapur logon ke riection se naaraaz hai
 Ranbir, who was seen in a hotel with PAK actress Mahira, PHOTOS Viralrishi said, 'I saw the picture in the morning
 isamen mujhe kuch hairaan karne vaala nahin laga
 So keep me out of all this and talk to the person who has these pictures'
 rishi ne aage kaha, 'maine unhen sirf tivetor par dekha, fasebuk or instagram par nahin
 Because I'm only on Twitter
 inamen aisa kuch nahin jo maine pehle na dekha ho yaa main na jaanata hum
 Ranbir is a young star, he is unmarried, he can meet anyone he wants
 ab yadi log unki personal life main dakhal den to ye thik nahin
 i cannot say anything about this, as Ranbir is young and has the choice to meet anyone
 ranbir kapur sang intimet seen ke baad aishwarya ab aage nahin karengi aisa sinabata den ki july main ranbir kapur sanjay dutt par banane vaali byopic kii shooting ke silsile main neuyork pahunche the
 During that time Mahira was also in New York in connection with one of her projects
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ye tasviren usee dauraan lee gai thim
 Earlier in March, both were seen together in Dubai
 yahaan yojit global teacher prise gaala main donon ne red karpet par saath walk kiya tha
 Looking at the chemistry between the two, from the same time it is being speculated that both are in a relationship
 haalanki donon ne hi kaha tha ki donon single hai or khush hai
 Regarding the relationship with Ranbir, Mahira had clarified that he was only in connection with work
 iske peeche koi or vajah nahin he
 Please tell that Mahira Khan got divorced in the year 2015
 unka ek betaa he
 He made his debut with Bol in 2011
 pakistani tele sho humsafar se unhen kaaphi pahchaan mili thi
 After this year, he made his Bollywood debut with the film Raees
 bihar ke chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar narend modi sarkaar qamar kas rahi he
 The effort is to leave no stone unturned
 lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ko bhunaane kii koshish bhi shuru ho gai he
 Existing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav are the product of JP movement and have been asserting jp's legacy
 ab bijepi ko bhi jepi kii lokapriyata main satta kii seedhi nazar aa rahi he
 Initiation is being done from jp's birthplace Sitabadiyara
 sitabadiara ke lala tolaa main rashtriya smarak or pustkaalay banane kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 The interesting thing is that there is already a trust and a library in jp's name in Sitabadiyara itself
 sitabadiara uttar pradesh or bihar donon main padataa he
 There are 27 hamlets in this village, located in Ara, Ballia and Chapra districts
 zaahir he sarkaar ke is faisle main logon ko jepi ke viraasat ko sanbhaalane kii baat kam, raajnneeti zyada lag rahi he
 In 1986, Jayaprakash Memorial Foundation was established in the Sitabadiyara part of Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar to carry forward jp's legacy
 jab tak chandrashekhar jinda rahe, tab tak to trust thik-thaak chalata rahaa
 a school for girls was opened, a library opened and a Khadi Gramodhog Bhavan in JP Nagar
 lekin chandrashekhar ke nidhan ke baad trust par kabje ko lekar court kachhari tak maamla chalaa
 In 2010, some broke away from the old trust and formed the Jayaprabha Foundation
 ye trust bana bihar ke lala tolaa main
 The distance between the two trusts is just two kilometers
 tark diya gaya ki ye trust jepi ke janmasthali par bana he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar got along
 us vakt jediu or bijepi saath-saath the, to laalkrishna adwani ne jepi kii janmasthali se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf rath yatra shuru kii
 After this, the journey of development started in this area
 aazaadee ke baad pehali baar is hisse main bijli ai
 Nitish is also a product of JP movement, so he also made many plans
 kuch par amal hua, to kuch par aadchan aa gai
 Meanwhile, there was a political divorce between JDU and BJP
 ab bihar main chunaav hone main chand maheene bache hai
 Therefore, to redeem jp's name, the central government also announced to build a national memorial at jp's birthplace
 pehle se jepi ke naam par bane trust main takaraar to tha hi, ab rahi sahi kasar centre sarkaar ke elaan ne kar diya
 The secretary of the up-based Jaypee Trust is now Ravishankar Singh, grandson of Chandrasekhar
 ve kehete hai, ham to jepi se judi ek bhi cheez ko smarak ko nahin soupenge
 The same Jayaprabha Foundation secretary Aloika Kumar Singh says, we will not take anything from there and neither will we ask for it
 bihar or deshbhar main jepi se jude dharoharon ko jutaya jayega
 It is worth noting that the up-based Jaypee Trust has many things related to JP and some Bihar-based trusts also have
 aisa lagata he ki ab jepi ke viraasat ko lekar ye ladaai keval jaiprakash narayan trust or jayaprabha foundation ke bich nahin, balki ye bihar or uttar pradesh ke bich bhi chal rahaa he
 The comments bijepi kii jepi yojana zaahir he jediu ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 That is why JDU leader Harivansh, who is associated with both trusts, says that if the central government was serious about this, it would not announce it at the time of elections
 abhi to sarkaar kii praathamikta jepi ke gaanv sitabadiara ko bachaane kii honi chahie, kyonki ganga or sarayu ke kataav kii vajah se gaanv khatre main he
 There is erosion in the Saryu and Ganga, which threatens the existence of many hamlets
 vaise gaanv vaale kehete hai ki ye acchhee baat he ki sarkaar jepi ke viraasat ko aage badhaane ke liye smarak bana rahi he, lekin pehle gaanv main nadi se jo kataav ho rahaa he, usase bachaav karen or gaanv kaa vikaas karen
 Existing Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav are the product of JP movement and have been asserting jp's legacy

 Initiation is being done from jp's birthplace Sitabadiyara
 sitabadiara ke lala tolaa main rashtriya smarak or pustkaalay banane kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 The interesting thing is that there is already a trust and a library in jp's name in Sitabadiyara itself
 sitabadiara uttar pradesh or bihar donon main padataa he
 There are 27 hamlets in this village, located in Ara, Ballia and Chapra districts

 It is obvious that in this decision of the government, people are less concerned about handling the legacy of JP, more is feeling politics
 jepi kii viraasat aage badhaane ke liye 1986 main purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar kii aguwai main uttar pradesh ke sitabadiara vaale hisse main jaiprakash smarak pratishthan bana
 As long as Chandra Shekhar remained alive, the trust ran well
 jepinagar main ladakiyon ko liye skool khulaa, pustkaalay khulaa or khaadi gramodhog bhawan bhi
 But after the death of Chandrasekhar, the matter was taken up to the court to take over the trust
 puraane trust se tuutakar kuch logon ne 2010 main jayaprabha phanudation bana liya
 This trust was formed in Lala Tola, Bihar
 donon trust ke bich kii duuri he maatr do kilometre
 It was argued that this trust is built on jp's birthplace
 saath mila bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa
 At that time JDU and BJP were together, LK Advani started the Rath Yatra against corruption from jp's birthplace
 iske baad is ilaake main vikaas kii yatra shuru hui
 For the first time after independence, electricity came to this part
 nitish bhi jepi andolan kii upaj hai, to unhone bhi kai sari yojanaayen banaain
 Some were implemented, some were hindered
 is bich jediu or bijepi main raajnneetik talaak ho gaya
 Now there are few months left for elections in Bihar
 lihaaja jepi ke naam ko bhunaane ke liye centre sarkaar ne bhi jepi ke janmasthali par rashtriya smarak banane kaa elaan kar diya
 There was already a dispute in the trust made in the name of JP, now the central government announced the right thing
 upi vaale jepi trust ke sachiv ab chandrashekhar ke pote ravishankar singh he
 They say, we will not hand over anything related to JP to the memorial
 vahi jayaprabha phanudation ke sachiv aaloka kumaar singh kehete hai, ham vahaan se kuch bhi nahi lenge or naa hi maangane jaaenge
 JP and the heritage associated with JP will be mobilized across the country
 gauratlab he ki upi vaale jepi trust ke paas jepi se judi kai chijen he or kuch bihar vaale trust ke paas bhi hai
 It seems that now this battle over jp's legacy is going on not only between Jayaprakash Narayan Trust and Jayaprabha Foundation, but also between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 tippaniyan bjp's JP plan is obviously not appealing to JDU
 tabhi to donon trust se jude rahe jediu netaa harivansh kehete hai ki agar centre sarkaar isko lekar gambhir hoti, to chunaav ke vakt iskaa elaan nahin karti
 Right now the priority of the government should be to save jp's village Sitabadiyara, because the village is in danger due to the erosion of Ganga and Saryu
 sarayu or ganga main kataav ho rahaa he, jisase kai tole kaa astitv khatm ho jane kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 By the way, the villagers say that it is a good thing that the government is building a memorial to carry forward jp's legacy, but first protect the village from the river erosion and develop the village

 ) i have seen the most cricket in my school days
 samajhie puri garmi kii chuttee test match dekhte hue or garmi kii chhuttiyon kaa homework karte hue beetaa
 This habit continued even after watching all the notes he made until graduation
 ek samay aisa tha ki main or papa raat-raat bhar de-and nite match bhi dekha karte the, jo chunaav riselt ke teen divasiy kaarykram ke alaava doosraa mahatvapurn saajha program hua karata tha ham donon kaa
 The understanding of politics and cricket only developed with Dad and i have tried my hand at both school and college days
 cricket ke saath maidan main meraa rishta, chauke yaa chakke liye aasmaan main uchhaale gaye ek corcket ball dwaara mere gaalon ko chuumane ke saath hi gharavaalon dwaara khatm kar diya gaya
 As a result, i started playing base-ball, because his ball is like an elbow or a sithaphal which can hurt you, but he is not afraid of bad face
 lekin cricket samajhane main aaj bhi koi dikkat nahin aati, phir chaahe vah test match ho, 20-20 yaa van-de or jab samajhati hum to bahut romanchit hoti hum
 
 
 As it happened today
 mere khyaal se har ladki ko jivan main kabhi naa kabhi cricket se pyaar karnaa chahie
 
 
 Even if you can't do it with a cricketer
 
 
 kyonki aisa naa karke ve jivan ke ek behad mahatvapurn romaanch se maharoom rah jaaengi
 We have many reasons for playing cricket, apart from keeping the body and mind fit, this or any other sport communicates a competitive spirit within us
 
 
 visham paristhitayon main ladane kii prerana bhi detii he
 If you think that as many women or men around us are successful according to any definition, then they must have some involvement with sports
 vah khel cricket bhi ho saktaa he, adventure sport bhi or shatranj bhi

 Here i took more names of women because i need more women participation in sports
 haalanki cricket ke saath jo glamer or rumaniyat judi he vah anya khelon ke saath nahin, isliye jaise ham pehle akzaam main aasaan sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai thik vaise hi aap cricket se pyaar kiijie, isliye nahin ki ye aapako aapke prince charming milaayegaa, balki isliye ki ye puure jivan aapke jivan ko charm-les nahin hone degaa
 Never let you lose, never let you sink into depression or depression
 maidan main antim gend tak ladane kii jo jijivishaa saamne aati he vah aapako zindagi kii har kathin ghadi main ladane kii takat degaa, jab koi bowler aapaki taraf yaker phenkega tab aap puure dam-kham se uskaa saamana karenge or jab koi spinner koi gugali phenkega tab aap bhi use badale main gugali dene kii koshish karenge
 This is to say that this game will make you a master of life, so much so that if you have ever been clean bold or hit-wicket then you can please yourself alone by saying that man, the umpire does not understand It was a no-ball labboluab yah ki ek cricketer kabhi bhi hameshaa ke liye nahin harata, har doosraa match uske saamne nai chunautiyon ke saath-saath urja kaa sanchaar karata he
 So love
