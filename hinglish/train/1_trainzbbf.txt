 To counter the BJP, the Congress is forced to walk on the path of soft Hindutva, while the BJP, which keeps distance from the Muslims, is now trying to embrace them
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mandir-mandir maathaa teka or darshan kiya to iskaa siyaasi phayda bhi mila
 With this formula, the Congress is now preparing to contest the Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly elections
 iske jawaab main bijepi bhi apni ranneeti main badlaav karte hue bengal main muslim maton ko rijhaane ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Tell me about the Muslim appeasement that the BJP used to accuse the Congress of Muslim appeasement for a long time and it used to get the benefit of the Hindutva card
 lekin gujarat main rahul gandhi ne bijepi kaa ye sameekaran gadabada diya
 Rahul went ahead with the strategy of soft Hindutva and also had a tremendous political advantage in the assembly elections

 Congress leaders have taken the initiative to rejuvenate 148 Ram temples in Gujarat

 At a rally in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat to Manglawar, newly elected opposition leader and Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani said that BJP only does politics in the name of Lord Ram
 wo nakli hindutv kii pratha ko aage badhaati he
 He said that under the non-government organization, people are taking the initiative to revive the Ram temples of the villages
 iske tahat gaanv ke ram mandiron main aarti karenge
 Will also distribute Puja kit for Aarti
 puja main istemaal hone vaale shankh, jhaalar or nagaada samet anya chijen is kit main hai
 The Congress leader believes that through this Hinduism has to maintain the spirit of devotion along with the tradition

 That is why the Congress will move ahead with this strategy in other states including Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan this year

 Meanwhile, fatigue started dominating the Dutch player and Saina realized this soon
 bhartiya khilaadi ne iske baad apane khel main adhik reliyon ko shaamil kiya or mauka milane par kuch karaare shaat lagaakar aasaani se ank jutaaye
 The world number five Indian player soon regained the lead, taking the score to 11-7

 sutron ne kaha, ‘kumble ne kaha ki agar kaarykram main 11 khilaadiyon ke liye keval ek pratham shrenee match rakhaa gaya he to vah chaahate hai ki daura karne vaale sabhi 16 cricketron ke liye test shrinkhalaa shuru karne se pehle pratispardhi match rakhane chaiye

 The Indian team is playing international matches for the first time in China, although the senior teams have clashed with each other 17 times in the past
 china saat baar bharat main khelaa tha, ye sabhi match aamantran toornament nehru cap main hue the
 India did not win in one of the 17 matches, while China won on 12 occasions
 paanch match drow rahe the
 The senior teams of India and China last clashed against each other in the 1997 Nehru Cup in Kochi, with the 'red Dragons' winning 2–1
 3 kaaran jinaki vajah se sachin jaise ballebaaj nahin ban sakate prithvibharatiya team ek bhi fifa vishwa cap main jagah nahin bana saki he, jabaki china ne 2002 main aisa kiya tha jisamen vah apane sabhi teenon match ganvaakar group charan se baahar ho gai thi
 China is not so dominant on the global stage, but in Asia it is one of the strongest football nations
 asia main team lagaataar sheersh 10 main or vishwa ranking main sheersh 100 main shaamil rahati he
 China currently occupies the 76th position in the FIFA rankings and seventh in Asia
 china asian cap main 11 baar khel chuki he jo mahadwipiya deshon kaa sheersh toornament he or isamen vah do baar up vijeta or kai baar tisare sthaan par rah chuki he
 On the other hand, India has played in the Asia Cup only three times (runners-up in 1964, 1984 and 2011) and recently made it to the top 100 in the FIFA rankings after a long time
 desh kii team abhi fifa ranking main 97wein or asia main 15wein sthaan par shaamil he
 Playing with China to seal Dhoni's reign behind the wicket until the World Cup is a bold move as the team has not played against the continent's top team in recent times, barring the Asian Cup or World Cup qualifiers

 His team will be very strong
 ve aakraamak footbal khelnaa chahenge or gend par bhi kabja rakhana chahenge
 We will go into this match with the intention of winning
 lekin agar ham haarate bhi hai, to bhi ham sakaaratmak pahalu dhundne kaa prayaas karenge
 ' vishwa cap cricket kii shuruyaat 1975 main cricket ke diwaanon ko hi mukammal toornament main bharpoor majaa dene ke makasad se prayog ke taur par kii gai
 i don't think the teams involved at that time even knew what they were starting
 aisa nahin ki muqabla kadaa nahin tha—kaante kii spardhaa thi—lekin sabhi timen ise dwipaksheeya cricket siries se alag pakhwaade bhar ke mouj-maje kii tarah dekh rahi thim or usee tarah iskaa anand uthaa rahi thim
 i was a new recruit of international cricket at that time and was very happy to be in the team with some of my ideal batsmen
 mujhe us toornament main bamushkil hi ballebaaji kaa mauka mila or final main apni fielding ke liye hi charchit hua
 When i had run out three batsmen
 khitaab jeetne ke baad or clive loyad ko lords kii balakani main chaandi ke cap ko uthaae dekhakar hi hamen ehsaas hua ki hamane kuch vishesh hasil kar liya he
 During the second World Cup, i had improved my career as a batsman
 main varisht ballebaaj ke rup main jimmedaari nibhaane kii kalpana kar rahaa tha or is baar apane balle se adhik jambaaji dikhaane ko lekar behad utsahit tha
 The World Cup was in England — we could not even imagine that it could happen anywhere else — and i liked the situation there
 isliye bhi ki main un dinon summerset main county cricket khelaa karata tha
 The team too had blossomed and it was believed that wherever we go, we hit the ground
 gordon greenidge, desmund hence, clive loyad, alvin kaalicharan or colice king jaise ballebaajon ke kaaran hamaari ballebaaji hi thos nahin thi, balki joel garnor, maaikel holding, endi roberts or colin craft jaise dhurandharon kii vajah se gendbaaji bhi laajawab thi
 Being the most favorite team does not guarantee to win the title, so we realized that we have to show our strength on the spot
 hamane bharat ke saath match se apane abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii or aasaan-si jeet hasil kii
 It was two weeks from the opening match to the last match and when we started well, our winning campaign started moving forward
 lig match aaraam se nikal gaye or ham aasaani se semifinal main pahunch gaye
 The semi-final was then with a very good team Pakistan
 vah un tiimon main thi jisamen gendbaaji kaa dhardaar akraman or ballebaaji bhi umdaa thi
 i remember that we were able to challenge more than 290 runs with the century partnership of Greenies and Hanes
 un dinon vishwa cap ke match 60 overon ke hua karte the lekin kul score 240 se upar le janaa kathin hota tha
 We used to score innings in the style of Test matches
 shuruyaat main kuch madan over se change room main gusse kaa shikaar nahin hona padataa tha
 Initially, the Pakistani team was chasing runs and we were going score by score
 maajid khan or jahir abbaas ne khubasurat ballebaaji kii or ek mode to aisa aayaa ki hamen apana puraa damakham dikhaakar khel ko zyada kadaa karnaa padaa
 i was very happy with my contribution in winning the match by taking three wickets
 is tarah ham mejabaan england ke khilaaf final main pahunch gaye
 a lot has been written about my century in the finals, but when i remember, i only feel the brilliant strokes of Collis King
 main us saajhedaari ke dauraan sirf colice kaa saath dekar khush tha or adhik se adhik strike unhen dene kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 There were some shots in his 86 runs that any round batsman would be proud of him! We were together at the crease when four wickets fell at 100 and took the team to a strong position with some difficulty
 main pari kii shuruyaat main strike badalata rahaa or aakhir main sahi maukey par maine apni raftaar badhaai
 The credit is also due to Kolis because he was keeping pace of consecutive runs, so that we could score runs with a good average
 vah shatak isliye bhi yaad kiya jaataa he ki maine maaikel hendrick kii aakhri gend par chakka jad diya tha
 i had guessed that he was about to throw a yorker and went ahead and rode a six
 santoshjanak score banane kaa vah tarika vaaki laajawab tha lekin ham jaanate the ki prudential cap ko apane paas rakhana he to hamen gendbaaji or fielding umdaa kerani hogi
 The openers had given a good fight by sharing around 100 runs for the first wicket but in those days the challenge of 290 runs was formidable
 hamaara gendbaaji akraman puure ternament main kaaphi kifayati rahaa tha
 England collapsed in 50 overs and made us the title owners for the second time in a row
 us maukey ko ham garv se yaad karte hai kyonki ham duniya kii behtareen team the
 However, it is also interesting that we were watching our performance during the celebrations as well
 dhilaai sambhav nahin thi kyonki hamamen se kuch ko kuch hi dinon baad apni county tiimon ke liye sande lig khelnaa tha
 Some of us sat directly in our car and headed to our destination
 The World Cup was won in a fortnight and the players started thinking about their county duty
 ve din shartiya taur par itane gahamagahami bhare nahin the! main un teen finelon ko bade garv se yaad karata hum kyonki hamen teenon main jeet ke liye pasandida team mana ja rahaa tha
 The 1983 final did not come to our account, but that is the beauty of the game - if the opposing team plays well, no one can be confident of winning the title

 The general is the same, his army has changed
 kyonki is nae captain ke paas he kisaanon kii sena

 Now for the former military general, it is a question of ideas, not of a person, and when it comes to ideas, in this country, who can remember more than Gandhi
 general sahab ne gandhi ke us mantra ko yaad kiya, jisamen haashiye par khadey aakhri aadmi ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 General's challenge is from Rewari to Delhi, then Kejriwal from Delhi to Farrukhabad

 The struggle for water has been going on for two thousand years, there is a dire need to correct the distribution of water
 On Saturday, the second and last day of India Today Conclave, like Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Funavis, Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray, Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog, Rajiv Kumar and p Sainath
 Celebrities attended
 conklev main 'panic Room: India's mega-water crisis
 And our role in triggering it 'during the session, p Sainath, Founder Editor of People's Archive of Rural India, answered the questions of Shoma Chaudhary, Consulting Editor of India Today
 pi sainath ne india today conklev ke dauraan jal sankat par apane vichaar rakhe
 He said that the water crisis in the country and the world today is not just naturally but a crisis created by humans
 unhone kaha, 'log kehete hai ki pani ke liye yuddh hoga lekin meraa maananaa he ki do hajaar saal se pani ke liye sangharsh hota rahaa he
 The distribution of water has not been uniform for centuries
 yah sangharsh kaa mul kaaran he
 He said that there is casteism even in the sharing of water
 aap pracheen samay se hi dekh sakate hai ki pani par agadi jatiyaan sabase pehle apana haq jataati rahi hai
 Dalits were beaten up if they went to their source for water
 'unhone kaha ki duniya kii aabaadi ke 18 fisadi log bharat main rahete hai lekin hamaare paas pine ke pani kaa maatr 4 fisadi uplabdh he
 In such a situation, if we do not properly distribute the water, then this crisis will deepen and cause conflict
 pani par sangharsh ko unhone ek udhaaharan ke jariye present kiya
 p Sainath said that a farmer in Kurnool, Maharashtra had 5 sons in his family
 kisaan kii jameen paanchon beton main bant gai
 There was no problem in this
 lekin chote bhai ne bad bhai kii hatya kar di
 You will be surprised to know the reason for this
 iskaa kaaran tha sinchit jameen kii ladaai
 There was a dispute between the brothers not on the sharing of land, but on the sharing of irrigated land, and then there was a case of murder
 pi sainath ne kaha ki jal sankat kaa ek bada kaaran raajnneetik faisle bhi hai
 If the government does not take the right decisions about water, then the water crisis will deepen
 ise unhone kai udhaaharan ke jariye samajhaayaa
 He said that if you go from Mumbai towards Pune then you will see many hoardings of builders on the highway
 unamem se kuch hordings kii tasviren bhi unhone dikhaai
 a builder is building a multi-story building
 isamen usne daawa kiya ki building ke har floor par swimming pool uplabdh karaayega yani vah flats main swimming pool balakani uplabdh karaayega
 Think about how much water will be used for this
 agar vah ise banane main kaamyaab hota he to iske liye vah sambandhit vibhaag se clearence legaa
 This means that if the government takes such a decision, the water crisis will increase
 unhone kaha ki jal sankat ke liye sarkaar ko acchhee planning kerani hogi
 Such a plan should be made that everyone should get water and for this, water should be declared as the basic right
 agar hamaare paas pani kii jo vartmaan uplabdhta he uskaa bantwaaraa sahi ho, agar ham uske phijul istemaal se bachein to jal sankat ko kam kiya ja saktaa he

 Arvind Kejriwal's infighting in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has intensified after a new audio sting
 tepe main arvind kejariwal yogendra yadav, prashanth bhushan or professor anand kumaar ke liye apshabdon kaa istemaal karte hue sunai de rahe hai
 Yogendra Yadav has said that he has been abused by his younger brother and he has no complaints
 main aahat or sharminda hum: anand kumarkejariwal kii bhashaa se aahat professor anand kumaar ne kaha, 'main aahat or sharminda mahasoos kar rahaa hum or ummid karata hum ki yah jhooth ho
 Ask those who have used this language
 mere kariyar ke dauraan kisi ne kisi ke liye aisi bhashaa istemaal nahin kii
 The leaders of the Kejriwal camp met after a new tape surfaced
 baithak main shaamil rahe ashish khetaan ne kaha, 'party main jo kuch chal rahaa he hamane us par charchaa kii
 We are disappointed
 ham aajkal amit shah kii press conference se zyada yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kii press conference se dare hue hai
 If we had recorded the conversation on his part, he would not have been able to show his face to the public
 ' gopal raay ne bataaya ki baithak main kejariwal ne vah pidaa saamne rakhi jisase vah do-chaar ho rahe hai
 Prashant Bhushan said that the expressions on the phone are more dangerous
 bhashaa to gusse main kharaab ho sakati he, lekin bhav hi gande hai
 He said that the party is not the property of anyone
 yahaan kaaryakarta or neshnal council sarvopari hai
 Younger brother has abused me, i do not complain: Yogendra AAP leader Yogendra Yadav reacted to this in his 'sweet' style as usual
 unhone kaha, 'pichley saal arvind kejariwal ne mujhe apana bada bhai mana tha
 If he has said something like that then he is my younger brother, i have no complaints
 vyaktigat apmaan itani badi baat nahin he
 This is not an issue for me at all
 log yah yaad nahin rakhenge ki kiskaa apmaan kiya gaya balki log yah yaad rakhenge ki hamane desh ke liye kya kiya
 'you must praise Kejriwal: Ashutoshparty is seen standing with Kejriwal on this issue
 AAP netaa ashutosh ne kaha, 'agar yah kejariwal kii aawaaj he, to unhen aise shabd istemaal nahin karne chahie the
 But the conversation should be viewed in a different context
 agar koi party ko todane yaa haraane kii koshish karegaa to swaabhaavik rup se kisi ko bhi gussa aa saktaa he
 Many times people say such things in anger
 aapako tarif kerani chahie ki koi bhi rashtriya sanyojak se baat kar saktaa he
 This means that it is a conspiracy to damage the image of Arvind Kejriwal
 haalanki abhi tak tepe kii pramanikta bhi sabit nahin hui he
 Yesterday, when the deal was completed, a sting suddenly surfaced
 isamen mujhe kejariwal kii chhavi kharaab karne kii sajeesh najar aati he
 'attempting to spoil the image: Another leader of the Dilip Pandey Kejriwal camp, Dilip Pandey, said that since the victory of the party, fake stings are coming out to malign Kejriwal's image
 yah kejariwal kii chhavi bigaadane kii sajeesh he
 If you start calling a private conversation a sting, you will be called a fool
 ise sting kahana thik nahin he
 Why Kejriwal is silent now: BJP: Accusing you leaders of being greed for power and being opportunistic, BJP today challenged Arvind Kejriwal to clarify the allegations of people of his own party and said that his true face is exposed to the whole country It is done
 bijepi ne yah bhi kaha ki unke apane logon dwaara ek sting main lagaae gaye aaropon ke mutabik aap main paardarshita or loktantr nahin he or siddhant evam swaraj ke iske bade daawey chhalaava hai
 BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said, Kejriwal speaks a lot about exposing other's mistakes but only his people have busted them
 unke logon ne hi unka nakaab utaar diya
 He said, Kejriwal should clarify the allegations leveled by his people in the sting
 vah chup kyon hai ? unki chuppi bataati he ki jo baaten khulkar aa rahi hai ve satya hai

 Hindustani Awam Morcha national president and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi left the NDA to join the grand alliance on Wednesday
 buudhvaar kii shaam jithan ram maanjhi or rashtriya janata dal netaa tejasvi yadav kii sanyukt press vaarta bhi hui, jahaan is baat kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya gaya
 Addressing this joint press conference, Jitan Ram Manjhi gave all the reasons why he decided to leave the NDA and join the Grand Alliance
 dilachasp baat yah he ki isi sanyukt press conference main maanjhi ne daawa kiya ki argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne unase telephone par baatcheet kii or mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya jiske baad unhone aisa karne kaa faisla liya
 Manjhi, however, did not say when Lalu Prasad spoke to him over the telephone
 magar sawaal ye uthta he ki is vakt argedy supremeo chaara ghotaale ke maamle main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad ranchi kii birsa munda jail main band hai, to kya lalu ne jail se haimanjhi ko telephone kar mahagathbandhanamen shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya?sawaal isliye uth rahe hai kyonki lalu prasad 23 disambar 2017 se ranchi jail main band hai or isse pehle jithan ram maanjhi ke mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kii koi khaas charchaa nahin chal rahi thi
 In recent times, the distance from Jitan Ram Manjhi's NDA has increased because Manjhi wanted to field his party candidate for the by-election for the Jehanabad assembly seat on March 11, but the BJP did not give him this seat and instead He asked JDU to contest from here
 sutron ke mutabikjithan ram maanjhichahate the ki aagaamee rajyasabha chunaavon main bhaajapa unhen rajyasabha bheje
 But the party was not ready for this as well, after which Manjhi became disenchanted with the NDA and decided to join the grand alliance
 yah sara ghatnakram pichley 15 dinon kaa he, jab maanjhi ne NDA chhod kar mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa nirnay liya
 If the question arises, did RJD supremo Lalu Prasad telephone him from Ranchi jail and ask him to join the grand alliance, which Manjhi mentioned on Wednesday? rail mantri pawan kumaar bansal jab apana rail bajet bhaashan taiyaar kar rahe the to unhen shaayad yah hargiz andaja nahin hoga ki vah jis kavita kii pankti ko padhane ja rahe hai usamen jataai gai ashanka sahi sabit hogi
 While presenting the railway budget, he read Dushyant's lines, 'it is not my motive to create a ruckus, it is an attempt that Surat should change
 ’ lekin in panktiyaan kii ashanka loksabhaa main sahi sabit ho gai kyonki bansal vipaksh ke hangaame ke kaaran apana rail bhaashan puraa nahin kar sake
 The lines that Bansal cited as the source of his inspiration during the railway budget were taken from Christine Vaderly's poem 'the Song of the Engine'
 angreji main likhi gai is kavita kaa anuwaad kuch is prakaar he : ‘jab aap rail main safar karte hai, or rail pahaad par chadhati he, to sirf ingine kii aawaaj suniye
 One who climbs up on you with full will although it moves very slowly but it sings a little song: i can, i can
 ’ Not only that, he also concluded his speech with the last lines of this poem by Christine Wadderly
 haalanki vipaksh ke hangaame ke kaaran antim panktiyon ko suna nahin ja sakaa
 The comments yah antim panktiyaan is prakaar thim : lekin baad kii yatra main
 
 
 The engine is still singing
 agar aap behad shanti se sunen
 
 
 You will hear this little song
 
 i thought i did it
 
 i did it
 or vah daud padataa he

 The translation of this poem written in English is as follows: 'when you travel on the rail, and the rail climbs the mountain, just listen to the sound of the engine
 jo puri ichhashakti ke saath aapako lekar upar chadhataa he haalanki yah bahut dhire-dhire chalata he lekin yah ek chota sa geet gaata he : main kar saktaa hum, main kar saktaa hum
 ' itnaa hi nahin, unhone apane bhaashan kaa samaapan bhi christine vaidarly kii isi kavita kii antim panktiyon se kiya
 However, the final lines could not be heard due to opposition uproar
 tippaniyan These last lines were as follows: but in a later journey
 
 
 ingine abhi bhi ga rahaa he
 If you listen very calmly
 
 
 aap yah chota sa geet sunenge
 
 maine sochaa tha maine kar diya
 
 maine kar diya

 desh bhar main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon or enarasi par tikhi bahes ho rahi he
 The opposition and the government are making their own claims about it
 isse jude kai sawaal logon ke man main hai
 In his special event 'agenda Aaj Tak 2019', Aaj Tak asked himself such questions to Home Minister Amit Shah
 ye sawaal tivi today group ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne shah ke saath alag-alag vishyon par lambii baatcheet ke dauraan rakhe
 Here are the questions of Rahul Kanwal and the answers of Amit Shah: - Question: You have got the Citizenship Amendment Act passed by Parliament, after this there are protests across the country, especially in universities and colleges, violence has also taken place
 aap is hinsa or protest ko kaise dekhte hai?amit shah:sabase pehle main ye spasht kar duun ki bahut sari uniwarsity ye shabd prayog thik nahin hoga, desh bhar main 224 vishvavidhyalay hai, agar nijee vishvavidhyalayon ko jod den to aankada 300 ke paar ho jaataa he
 Of these, 22 have been performed at the university
 inamen se 4 main gambhir pradarshan hua he
 Like- JMI, Nadwa of AMU Lucknow
 
 
 aise teen chaar vishvavidhyalay main gambhir pradarshan hua he
 People have gathered in support of these demonstrations elsewhere, where 100, 200, 300, 20, 11 people have gathered
 to 224 main 22 aise vishvavidhyalay hai jahaan pradarshan hua he
 So to say that it has been performed in many universities, it is not good, it has been done in limited quantity
 " ye pradarshan bhi isliye ho rahaa he kyonki bacchon ne naagarikta kanoon ko thik se nahin padhaa he
 i want to appeal through your program that people should study this act properly, and if they feel that something is wrong, the government is ready to discuss with them
 mujhe lagata he ki jaise-jaise log ye kanoon samajhate jaaenge, iske khilaaf virodh pradarshan kam hota jayega
 Question: The students of JMI were protesting against the CAA, after which the Delhi Police entered the campus to control the violence that took place there
 
 
 aarope ye he ki police hostel-librari main ghusi jahaan chaatr chhipe hue the
 You are the Home Minister, Delhi Police reports to you
 
 
 dilli police campus, librari college main kyon ghusi?amit shah:dekhie jahaan tak chaatro kaa sawaal he, police kaa unke peeche padane kaa koi sawaal paidaa nahin hota he
 But there is stone pelting from inside the university campus
 vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr, yaa to chaatro ke saath milakar padhane vaale jo koi log hai, baahar aate hai, kisi kaa scooter roak lete hai, do pahiyaa roak lete hai, moped roak lete hai
 
 
 Take out petrol, just burn it
 
 
 kisi kii gaadi jalaane kaa prayaas karte hai or us vakt bhi agar police kuch nahin karti he to main maanata hum ki police sahi se apni duty nahin kar rahi he
 When the Protest takes the form of violence, it is the duty of the police to stop it as well as religion
 jo un logon ne nibhaayaa he
 As far as the police should have gone in, should not have gone, it is not right to say so
 
 
 main maanata hum ki police uchit samay par is par swat: faisla karegi
 Question: But did you ask the Delhi Police how they entered without the permission of the VC? Amit Shah: As the Home Minister right now, i told the Delhi Police that it is your responsibility to make complete peace in Delhi
 baaki sab chizon kii baat shanti hone ke baad hogi
 The important question for the Home Minister is that there should be peace in Delhi


 i did it
 sawaal: jamiya milia islamia main hinsa bhadki uske baad hamane dekha ki silampur ilaake main bhi tanaav tha, vahaan par bhi police par patharbaji kii gai
 
 
 Why do you think this is happening, and what is your strategy to overcome it? Amit Shah: See, the opposition is uniting and spreading rumors about CAA that it will isolate the minority
 main sabhi minurity ke bhaaiyon or bahanon ko kahana chahta hum ki is act se aapako ratti bhar bhi nuksaan nahin hone vaala he
 Because nobody's citizenship goes away from this act, it is a law to give citizenship to someone
 or jab kisi ko naagarikta dene kaa kanoon he to bharat ke naagarik or mukhyat: musalmaan ko chintaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Those who have come from three countries due to religious persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the minorities in which this law has been changed to simplify the work of granting citizenship to Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, Christians, Hindus
 sawaal: do sawaal banate hai, CAA ko agar sirf akele dekha jaae to koi dikkat nahin he, lekin jab is act ko NRC se jodakar dekha jaataa he to ye khatarnaak combination ban jaataa he
 You have said that you will complete the NRC process before 2024
 logon se naagarikta kaa pruf maangenge
 Some will submit documents, some people will not have documents
 ye do category ke log ho sakate hai yaa to ve non muslim ho sakate hai, agar ve sikh, jain, parsi, buddha, isai hindu hue to fouran aap unako naagarikta de denge, lekin agar ve muslim hue to fouran aap unako ditension camp main band kar denge
 Is this okay? Amit Shah: First, let me make it clear that there will be no action on the basis of religion in the NRC
 jo koi bhi NRC ke tahat is desh kaa naagarik nahin paaya jayega, use desh se baahar nikaala jayega
 So to say that NRC will be for Muslims only, according to me it is completely wrong
 duusari baat NRC lekar koun aayaa
 Those who are protesting today
 
 
 congress adhyaksha ko
 
 
 i want to ask Ghulam Nabi Azad, when the Assam Accord was signed in 1985, the NRC was first accepted, then clause-14a was added to the Citizenship Act of 1955 on 3 December 2004
 
 
 us vakt upie kii sarkaar thi
 Was not ours uske baad rule 4 joda gaya jo desh bhar main NRC banane kii takat detaa he wo bhi 9 november 2009 ko joda gaya
 Congress was in government even then
 unke banaae kanoon par aaj wo hamen sawaal kar rahe the
 So what law did you make to keep it in the showcase? Why not make it seems not necessary? Question: If you look at the NRC separately, there is no problem
 kolkata main aap hi ke sarkaar ke sahyogi hemanth biswa sharma ne kaha ki NRC or CAA combo hai
 BJP leaders in Assam are saying that there are 19 areas in Assam where Hindus and Bengalis will be added, the population equation of that area will change
 or yahaan par bijepi ko phayda hoga
 On seeing these two together, the question arises, what is the intention? Amit Shah: Do not try to combine it with costuancy
 
 
 puraa masalaa samajhane ke liye peeche janaa padegaa
 First of all, the division of this country should not have been done on the basis of religion
 magar ye katu vaastaviktaa he
 The country was divided on the basis of religion
 congress ne bantwaare kii demand par sarender kiya, or is desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua
 Many people died
 bahut saare logon kii pratadna hui
 Millions of refugees came here and millions of refugees went there
 uske baad bhi bahut saare musalmaan yahaan rah gaye, rahane bhi chahie the, kyonki hamane kaha tha ki ham secular country hai, ham panthanirpeksh banenge
 Good thing, they should not get any heat
 bahut saare hindu, buddha, jain, sikh, chrishchiyan, parsi vahaan rah gaye
 Everyone was worried about what would happen to them later
 badi demand hui
 In 1950, an agreement was reached between Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan in Delhi to protect the minorities of the two countries
 donon deshon ne unki suraksha tay kii
 What was the population when the two countries compromised
 abhi kaa jo pakistan he vahaan par lagbhag 23 fisadi aabaadi hinduon kii thi, bangladesh jise us vakt purvi pakistan kehete the, main 30 pratishat hindu the
 Today 3 percent remain in Pakistan
 kahaan gaye?
 Religion was forced
 yaa to wo dharm bachaane ke liye yahaan aa gaye
 Where there were 30 percent, today there are 7 percent
 
 
 kahaan gaye? dher saare kisse hai
 
 
 i told in Parliament
 
 
 bacchiyon ko jabaran dharm parivartan kara kar nikaah karaayaa gaya
 Any good can live like this, where will these people go
 
 
 wo yaheen aae
 
 
 When the nehru-liaquat pact was not implemented, there was minority, they had the right to be given shelter here
 citijanship di jaae
 The Congress kept him in a state of hell for 70 years in the run-up to the vote bank
 aisi jindagi jeene ko majaboor kiya
 Narendra Modi brought with him CAA, due to which he will now be able to live with respect
 apni bacchiyon kii raksha kar paaenge
 You will be able to raise your bailiff accordingly
 apni aasthaa ko wo aane vaali pidiyon tak le ja paaenge
 It has become back ground that why Citizenship Amendment Act is necessary? Why is it necessary to give citizenship to these people, as the Prime Minister of India promised
 aaj main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 
 
 Listen to the statement of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru which the Congress says
 "hamen raajnneetik simaaon ke kaaran hamase dur ho chuke apane bhaaiyon-bahanon jo dekh rahe hai or is samay swatantraaa samroh main shaamil nahin ho sakate hai
 He is also concerned
 chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae wo hamaare hai or hameshaa hamaare hi rahenge
 We will be equally participants in their happiness and sorrow and whenever they want to come, we will accept them
 "'rajendra prasad ne apane shapathgrahan ke vakt kaha- ham un visthapit vyaktiyon ko punarsthapit karne ke liye vyagr hai, jo kaaphi kathinaayee or asuvidha jhel rahe hai
 They are welcome to come here anytime
 sardaar patel ke bare nahin kahuunga, congress nahin maanegi unki
 Now hear the Congress Party's proposal, "25 November 1947, the Congress Executive adopted the following resolution
 congress pakistan ke un sabhi gaiyr muslimon
 
 
 Listen to my words carefully
 
 
 maine aisa nahin kaha he
 
 
 
 ham kahenge to hinduvaadi ho jaaenge, congress kahegi to secular hogi
 
 
 The Congress is bound to give full protection to all those non-muslims of Pakistan
 jo unke jivan or sammaan kii raksha karne ke liye seemaa paar kar ke bharat aae hai yaa aane vaale hai
 "this is the commitment of the Congress
 ab mahatma gandhi ke bare main suniye
 
 
 
 pakistan main rah rahe hindu or sikh, yadi vahaan nahin rahanaa chaahate, to ni:andeh bharat aa sakate hai
 In this case it is the first duty of the Government of India to give them employment, citizenship and give them a life of dignity and happiness
 7 july 1947 kaa ye bayaan he
 Now listen to what Manmohan Singh said
 purv pradhanmantri jo aaj protest kar rahe hai
 
 
 He said on 18 December 2003, "minorities have to face oppression in countries like Bangladesh
 agar halaat in logon ko majaboor karte hai to hamaara naitik daayitv in abhaage logon ko naagarikta pradaan karnaa he
 The government should think about this
 "uske baad main ashok gahalot ne 2009 main pi chidambaram ko patr likhaa, "main aapkaa dhyaan pakistan se aae visthapit hindu or sikh samudaay kii taraf le janaa chahta hum, ye visthapit nirakshar hai, essi, asti or pichhadaa samaaj se aate hai
 
 
 They are living in extreme poverty, they are demanding citizenship of India, they should plan to give citizenship immediately
 " ye congress ke saare logon kaa stand he
 But due to vote-bank politics, the Congress turned away from its promise
 na ham vot bank kii raajnneeti karte hai, na karne denge
 Now NRC
 
 
 maine pehle kaha NRC kii shuruyaat congress ne kii wo chhod bhi do
 Even today i want to say to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Ghulam Nabi
 
 
 aap ek statement kar do ki pakistan or bangladesh main jitne bhi musalmaan hai sab yahaan aa jaaen ham unako naagarikta de denge
 What they are saying is give citizenship to intruders as well
 sawaal: logon ke paas dastavej nahin hai, wo naagarikta kaise sabit karenge
 The opposition has said that there is a problem in showing the marksheet
 
 
 garib log kahaan se dastavej dikhaaenge?amit shah:assam samjhaute main 1971 kii matadaata suchi record ke rup main rakhi hui he
 They have their names in it, that is the same document
 isamen koi samasya nahin he
 His father's name is in the 1971 voter list
 kya duniya main koi aisa desh he, jahaan par naagarik register nahin he? jo bhi jaae vahaan naagarik ban saktaa he? kya yahaan kaa naagarik vahaan kii naagarikta le saktaa he? to kya congress party ye kahana chaahati he ki duniya bhar se koi musalmaan aae, kyonki hindu ko le rahe ho to aap usko bhi sweekaar kar lo
 What kind of country goes on? ”as far as discrimination is concerned, many countries of Europe have made rules for citizenship that only if you invest so much, you will get citizenship of our country
 kya ye garibon ke saath bhedbhaav nahin he? itane padhe likhe honge tabhi ham aapako naagarikta denge, kya ye anpadh ke saath bhedbhaav nahin he
 If you are taking educated scientists of India, then take the poor of India also
 jo hamen puch rahe hai ki bhedbhaav kyon kar rahe hai? to aapane bhi alag tareeke se bhedbhaav kiya he
 But we have not made any discrimination
 ''bantwaare ke vakt bharat kaa vachan tha ki jo hindu or sikh bhai vahaan rah gaye hai, jo us desh main alpsankhyak hai, agar wo us desh main rahanaa nahin chaahate to bharat desh unhen sweekaar karegaa
 It is the word of the House of our country, the word of the Governor General of the country, the word of the Prime Minister of this country and above all the commitment of Mahatma Gandhi
 jisko puraa desh maanata he
 Then why is his entry being questioned? ’question: Why is citizenship not being given on the basis of oppression
 
 
 utpeedan bhashaa ke aadhaar par, sect ke aadhaar par, vishwaas ke aadhaar par ho saktaa he, pakistan main ahmadiya kaa utpeedan ho rahaa he
 Why harassment cannot be the basis
 amit shah:hamaare act main praavdhaan he, hamane pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan ke 600 muslimon ko naagarikta di he
 The commitment of our country's Parliament, the then Prime Minister, the then President and Mahatma Gandhi is that whenever the minorities of these three countries do not want to live there, they will be given shelter and citizenship
 main maanata hum ki ye duty he
 These three countries are due to partition
 aaj main congress ke netaaon se poochna chaahunga ki uganda se saare hindu aae to hinduon ko naagarikta kyon di bhaiya aapane? kal maano bhagwaan na kare jaisaa uganda main hua vaisaa france kare
 If a ruler in France would come and say that if Hindus were expelled, then where would the Hindu go? Where he will go in the world, he will come here and cannot go anywhere, will come here only
 sikh kahaan jayega, yaheen aayega
 If we expel everyone from Africa, it will come here and we should accept it
 sawaal: is kanoon ko aapane 3 hi desh ko kyon rakhaa? srilanka main tamil hinduon kaa dharm ke aadhaar par utpeedan ho rahaa he
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Swami are demanding citizenship for them? Amit Shah: Many times in the country made different provisions for granting citizenship
 lanka ke liye bhi banaae gaye
 We gave citizenship to over 6 lakh Tamil brothers who came from Sri Lanka
 us vakt inako naagarikta kyon nahin di gai? ek samasya ko ham adress kar rahe the
 Why didn't you give them when you came from Uganda? Indira ji granted collective citizenship in 1971
 tab hamane unako kyon nahin di? kyonki ham vishesh samasya ko solve kar rahe the
 Question: You said that if there is persecution of Hindus in France or Germany, where will they go, they will come, Savarkar is the icon of BJP and especially RSS, he created the idea of india as a Hindu nation, is today's BJP government in India? Sees it as a Hindu nation? Amit Shah: 'not at all, we see India as per the constitution
 desh kaa ek hi dharm ho saktaa he, sarkaar kaa ek hi dharm ho saktaa he vah he hamaara samvidhan
 Apart from this, there can be no religion
 sawaal: desh ke alpsankhyak samaaj main bhay he, khauf he
 What confidence do you want to give to the country's minority community? Amit Shah: i just remove the fear
 
 
 jo mul bharat ke naagarik hai wo chaahe kisi bhi dharm ke hon darane kii jarurat nahin, enarasi aapako kabhi baahar nahin karegi, ham minurity ko ye samajhane ke liye vishesh prayaas karenge kyonki unamem bhram failaayaa gaya
 No one needs to be afraid, no one will be tortured
 magar desh aise nahin chalata ki simaaon ko khulaa chhod do, jo aana chaahe wo aa jaae
 
 
 Those who are intruders must go, i believe that they should automatically say that we have come by mistake and arrangements should be made to send us back

 Even though the party did not manage to win more seats, its vote share recorded a huge increase
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 6
 This time BJP got 14 percent votes
 5 fisad vot mili
 After the election results are announced, there is another shocking political development
 pashchim bengal ke kai gramin ilaakon main muslim samudaay ke log bijepimen shaamil ho rahe hai
 Especially in areas where the party's vote share has registered an unprecedented increase
 is aashay kii khabar chhaapi he angreji akhbaar da indian express ne
 According to the newspaper, hundreds of Muslim families are joining the BJP in rural areas of West Bengal, especially Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat and some areas of Raiganj, Balurghat and Nadia
 in ilaakon main bijepi yogadan kaarykram kaa aayojan kar rahi he
 The party had started the program in these areas of the state only after the results were declared on 16 May
 haalanki, is puri prakriya ke jariye ab tak kitne log bijepi main shaamil hue, iskaa koi aadhikarik aankada to nahin he
 But according to the local BJP unit, only about 50,000 people are associated with the party in Jalpaiguri area
 is raajnneetik ghatnakram kii kai vajahen bataai ja rahi he
 People of the Musmil community are joining the BJP due to political faith, fear and weak leadership of the Left

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stream of speech delivered from the ramparts of the Red Fort will be remembered by the people for a long time because the people of the country had not heard anything from the Red Fort that could touch their hearts for years
 mahaj aankadon or tathakthith pragati kii khokhli baaten sunakar log use ek nodeevent maanane lage the lekin piem modi ne usamen phir se jaan daal di or vah bhi bina bade vaadon ke
 He reminded the public and mps of their duties rather than government announcements
 safai jaisi choti dikhne vaali baat ko unhone behad bada banaakar dikhaaya
 He spoke of taking the public along with him at every step, which is beyond tradition
 yah bahut badi baat he kyonki bharat main logon ko yah aadat si pad gai he jo kaam sarkaar kaa he vah vahi karegi
 But PM Modi has associated it with him because he knows that no campaign to keep this huge country clean without being with the public can be successful
 sarkaar kii banaai tamaam yojanaayen janata ke shaamil hue bina nishphal sabit hongi
 It is also a demand of democracy that people should be added to the implementation of every small and big scheme
 pradhan mantri ne aisa hi kiya
 Overall it was a very successful program and a solid start
 lekin mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise muddon par piem kii chuppi kuch hairaan karti he
 These were both his electoral issues and he also promised to curb them
 mahangaai rokane ke liye uthaae jane vaale kadamon kaa na to unhone koi zikr kiya or na hi uski koi paroksh charchaa kii
 Similarly, he remained silent about the Lokpal Bill or any such step even when he had said a lot about it in his election speeches
 ho saktaa he vah is manch ko ghoshnaa karne kaa plateform nahin bananaa chaahate hon lekin vah ek ishaara to kar hi sakate the
 These are both issues on which the success or failure of his government rests
 mahangaai ne kai sarkarein gira di hai or bhrashtachar to desh kii jadon ko khokhla bana rahaa he
 Keeping silence on them cannot be part of any strategy
 in par unhen baat kerani hi padegi or kadam uthaane hi padenge kyonki janata kaa dhairya bahut lambey samay tak bana nahin rah saktaa he
 Apart from this, it was also an important part of Prime Minister Modi's election announcement
 zaahir he ve in par kaam karenge or kade kadam bhi uthaaenge lekin isaki jhalak pesh karne main koi buraai nahin thi
 It can now be expected that the Prime Minister will be ready to take some action on these
 mahangaai ko to behatar prashasan or khaadya vastuon kii vyapak supplai sunishchit karke dur kiya ja saktaa he lekin bhrashtachar ko dur karne ke liye kathor kadamon kii jarurat hogi
 All these steps are awaited

 i came home late at New Year's celebration, so it was late in the morning
 hameshaa kii tarah akhbaar uthaaya or chand panne ulatate hue filmi pej par pahunchaa
 The film page looked at a story which had the details of the release of some big and selected films coming in 2015
 usee ke najadik bollywood ke kuch nirdeshkon kaa naam or unki pasandida filmon kaa naam likhaa tha
 Everyone named their favorite films and said that i will watch this film
 magar main chaunk gaya nirmaataa tigmanshu dhulia kaa naam or unki pasand dekhakar
 According to this newspaper, he would like to see 'jagga Jasoos', 'badlapur', 'shamitabh', 'bombay Velvet', 'byomkesh Bakshi', 'fitoor' and 'yara' in 2015
 tigmanshu kii list ne mujhe nahin chaunkaaya balki chaunkaaya uske aage ke vaakya ne jisamen likhaa tha "these are the films; the rest are circus pieces" Which films are Tigmanshu Circus Peace now saying? In 2015, Shah Rukh's 'fan', Salman's film 'bajrangi Bhai Jan' and 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo', Arjun Kapoor's 'tevar', Saif's 'phantom', Ranbir Kapoor's 'roy', Ranveer Singh's Big films like the film 'baji Rao Mastani' are the main ones
 to kya tigmanshu ko ye filmein sarkas pis kii tarah lagati hai? i am a film journalist, so sometimes i go to the flashback and as soon as i read it, i went to the flash back and reached the press conference of the film 'bullet Raja'
 'bullate raja' main saf ali khan or sonakshi sinha mukhya bhoomika main the or tigmanshu dhulia film ke nirdeshak the
 These films can be called a Bollywood masala film or a complete commercial film
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he, jab us press conference main tigmanshu ne kaha tha ki "ham jaise filmkaar jab commercial filmein banaaenge tab commercial film kii rup rekha or tasviir badal denge" tigmanshu ne yah bhi kaha tha ki main duusare nirdeshkon kii tarah hero ko hawa main udaakar aise mukke nahin marava saktaa, jisase ek mukke se gunda chaar baar uchhalkar gire
 At that time, i was proud of his language and statement
 or kehete hai na ki ghamand hameshaa chakanachur hota he
 This happened when the film 'bullet Raja' flopped badly
 ab thodaa tigmanshu kii filmon ke bare main bhi bataa duun
 His debut film 'haasta' was not very successful at the box office, but the film was praised by critics
 uske baad tigmanshu ne film 'charas' banaai, jo buree tarah flop hui
 He remained out of the scene for a long time in the meantime, making the film 'paan Singh Tomar'
 tigmanshu par shaayad bharosa na hone ke kaaran yah film kai saalon tak relies nahin ho pai
 Later the film was released by UTV and the film was not only a hit, but also much appreciated
 isi bich film 'sahib bivi or gangsters' ne thik-thaak kaarobaar kar liya tha
 Tigmanshu's days were reversed after the success of 'paan Singh Tomar' and 'saheb Biwi Aur Gangsters'
 ab inhen bade bajet kii bade star ke saath badi film 'bullate raja' mil chuki thi or inke bade bol shuru ho gaye
 There are many directors in this industry, who make great films and successful films
 rakesh om prakaash mehara ne 'rang de basanti' or 'bhaag milkha bhaag' jaisi behtareen filmein banaain
 But never spoke such a big thing, which spoiled his pride
 aaj kii taarikh main sabase sammanit nirdeshak hai, raju hiraani
 They win the hearts of critics from the box office, but never spoke such a big thing in which their arrogance is seen
 aaj ke box offis ke sabase kaamyaab nirdeshak rohit shetty hai, magar yah kabhi nahin kehete ki main bade tir maar rahaa hum
 They all know that the head of the egoist is bowed down and also knows that different types of films are made and different types of films have different audiences
 yahaan star power bhi chalata he or acchhee kahani or vishay bhi
 Tigmanshu Dhulia has neither made 'sholay' nor 'mughal-e-azam' yet speaks very well
 vaise, bade bol ke ek or shikaar bane, jiskaa naam he, sajid khan
 After the success of 'hey Baby' and 'housefull', his lyrics were also similar
 vah kai baar bol chuke the ki meri film flop nahin ho sakati
 i make films for audiences and know their choices very well
 film 'himmatwala' ke muhoort par sajid ne kaha tha ki 'himmatwala' 4 se 5 din main 100 karod kii kamai karegi, lekin 'himmatwala' buree tarah flop hui
 The fate of the film 'humshaklaas' was also bad
 aise main yah saaf he ki jisane bhi bade bol bole upar vaale ne unke bol ko nicha dikhaaya

 He knows that the film did not spoil due to my negligence
 aag ko pradarshit hue do saal se zyada kaa samay bitne ke baad bhi industry main is film ko lekar chutkule sunaae jate hai
 On his criticisms, Ramu said, "I do not mind these things

 i get away from it after the film is released
