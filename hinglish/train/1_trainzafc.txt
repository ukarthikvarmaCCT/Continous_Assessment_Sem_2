 " skulon main sex ajukeshan dene ke mudde par uthne vaale hangaame par mujhe hameshaa hairaani hoti he
 After all, why do some people get angry and start accusing that this will destroy innocence? i think that sex education, instead of education, is a discussion on erotic topics or more obscene things with children
 isi vajah se ve ho-hallaa machaate phirte hai
 But the time has come for them to wake up and know the reality that all this filth is reaching most children with just the click of a button or a mouse
 yakeen nahin ho rahaa? to google search baar main tip karen 'haau tu' or dekhen ki kaise 'haau tu du sex' yaa 'haau tu kis' ke behisaab tareeke aapke liye paros die jate hai
 So get out of the maze of myths
 aaj kii duniya main yon shiksha utani hi ahm he jitna padhana, likhnaa or ganit
 If this proposal sounds strange, then answer these simple questions: You want your child to feel ashamed of the changes happening in his body? You want your child to get sex related information from the porn site? You would like Will your child grow up thinking that sex is dirty and ill-minded people think of sex? Would you like your child to be a victim of sexual violence? Nki he probably figured he nor what is going above and enlist the help of her elders
 agar jawaab 'nahin' he to aapako maan lenaa chahie ki bacchon ke liye sex ajukeshan behad jaruri he
 My husband and i had decided that as children grow up, they will be given sex education in a natural and natural way
 hamaare puure parivaar kii vanya jivan main dilchaspee rahi he, isliye hamaare bachche bahut chote se hi jaanwaron kii meting or breeding jaise shabdon se waakif the
 i remember that i took my four-year-old son to the Life Science Museum in England, where he saw a video for children about how a child is born
 use vah video bahut pasand aayaa or usne sawaalon kii bauchhaar kar di thi
 We answered in easy language and he understood
 beti ko bhi hamane aise hi bataaya tha
 As they were growing up, the scope of questions was also getting bigger and we tried to give them factual information
 kabhi-kabhi unke sawaal asahaj bhi kar dete the
 Sex education in schools should start from the junior grade itself
 research ke mutabik bachche pichley dashak kii tulana main ab thodaa pehle yauvan kii dahalij par pahunch rahe hai
 Earlier girls were between 10 and 13 and boys reached puberty from 11 to 14, but now they are reaching Tarunai only one or two years ago
 isliye bacchon ko sex se judi jaankaree sahi samay par dena unke hit main he
 According to statistics, Scandinavian countries found significantly fewer cases of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases than in other countries
 jaahir he, iske peeche 10 saal kii umr se hi bacchon ko di ja rahi vyapak sex ajukeshan kii ahm bhoomika hogi
 After all, how should sex education be given? The best way is to divide the children into separate groups of boys and girls, and then inform them about the topic related to sex
 isse unhen sawaal poochne main sankoch nahin hoga
 In order to make it more effective, such discussion should be organized for parents and they too should be prepared to discuss this subject easily
 shikshak aisa ho jo bacchon ke sex sambandhi sawaalon kaa sahaj or sahi jawaab de sake
 Most importantly, the whole process of learning should be emotionally relaxed for the children, where no question should be made about them, nor should they be mocked
 padhaaye jane vaale vishyon main ladke or ladakiyon main ho rahe shaareerik badlaav, vipareet sex ke prati aakarshan, irection, periods, swatchta, yon jhukaav, garbhaadhan, garbhavastha, janm, ladke-ladakiyon main fark jaise mudde or sibar duniya se bachaav karne ke upaay shaamil hon
 Cinema, music and sports can be used to make discussions with teenagers more interesting
 sabase mahatvapurn yah samajhnaa he ki acha sparsh, bura sparsh kise kehete hai or yon hinsa kya he? bacchon ko khud ko surakshit rakhane kaa tarika sikhaane kii jarurat he or unhen yah bhi bataanaa he ki asurakshit mahasoos karne par khud ko kaise bachaaen
 For this, talk openly, discuss and show it to yourself until they understand it well
 mahila or bal vikaas mantralay kii ore se bal yon utpeeda par karaae gaye 2007 ke adhyayan ke mutabik, 53
 2 percent of children are victims of sexual violence
 media main balaatkaar or yon hinsa ke badhate maamalon ko dekhne ke baad bhi ham bal yon utpeeda par khulkar baat karne main sankoch kar rahe hai
 It is our collective responsibility as a society to get out of our hollow attitude of denying reality and make sex education an essential part of the children's curriculum so that our children can learn the most essential skills in life

 From this wedding, Gulsida's family convened a panchayat of Mojiz people in the village on 25 February 2013 to recover Gulsida
 panchayat ne azim ke parijanon par dabaav banaate hue apane faisle main 70 hajaar jurmaana or ladki ke badale azim kii bahan mussvis jahaan kaa nikaah gulsida ke bhai mohammad shaadaab ke saath karaane kaa farmaan suna daalaa

 On the one hand, Musavis Jahan was tortured in the in-laws and on 26 March 2013, on the other side, a case was filed against his brother for extorting the girl to the police station
 is maamle main police ne gulsida ke bayaan darj karaaye, to gulsida ne bayaan apane pati or mussvis jahaan ke bhai ke paksh main diya or usee ke saath chali gayi
 After this Musavis Jahan alleged that his in-laws beat him up
 uske nandoi ansaar, do jeth irshaad or shahzad 20 july ko ghar par aaye or raat main in teenon ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 When he protested, threatening to kill him, he was told that we have avenged our girl's escape from your family, after which the victim girl somehow heard you coming back to your house
 iske baad peedit yuvati ne insaaf kii khatir apane sasuraalio par thane main balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karaate hue insaaf kii guhaar lagaayee he
 The police have registered a case and started proceedings
 mussvis bataati hai, ‘mere bhai azim ne fateh mohammad kii ladki gulsida se court marij thi
 After this, people put pressure on the family to give girl instead of girl or else they will kill you
 meri ammi ne meri rukhsati kar di or 75 hajaar rupee bhi diye
 Later the in-laws started harassing people
 20 july ko meraa nanadoi or donon jeth raat ko mere kamare main ghus aaye or mere saath balaatkaar kiya

 At that time it was decided that no legal proceedings would be taken in the case and the two sides reached a mutual agreement and the boy's sister was married to the girl's brother
 ab ladki ne ye aarope lagaaya he ki uske nandoi or do jeth ne uske saath balaatkaar kiya he

 He said, 'I don't want to blame anyone

 film kaa naam:hunter (hunterrr)diarector: harshavardhan ji

 5 starvatsyayan kii prasiddh rachana'kamasutra'har sadi main alag-alag tarah se saamne aati he or is baar usee prishthbhumi par 21veen sadi kaa kamasutra, 'hunter' ke rup main parosane ko taiyaar hai diarector harshavardhan kulkarni, jo mumbai ke nivasee hai or ejineering kii padhai bhi kar chuke hai
 There is also a husband and father, he had kept a thought in mind since college time and his thinking has finally come out as 'hunter'
 film kaa pramotion bahut hi anokhe tarah se kiya gaya he, jahaan kaamuk bhaavana se bhare hue photo kii bharmaar he
 Sometimes women are standing with a hero standing inside a banana, sometimes a hero looking between two fingers in an erotic way, but will this film win the hearts of the audience? Let's know what is the story of 'hunter'
 1989 se 2015 ke bich ghatane vaali film 'hunter' kii kahani main mandaar ponkashe (gulshan devaiyaa ) ek maharashtra ke madhyam varg kaa ladkaa he jise bachapan se hi ladakiyon ko dekhakar ek alag tarah kii bhaavana jaagrit hoti he, sharmaate hue hi sahi wo ladakiyon ke paas jaakar dosti karnaa chahta he or vaasana kii bhaavana khulkar saamne aati he
 Calls himself Vasu (who has no control over sex)
 kabhi savita,bela, alka to kabhi shila, sushamaa or sunita ke sang lipt rahata he
 But as the age progresses, the Mandar realizes that the life of lust becomes strange after a while
 uske aas paas ke sabhi logon kii shaadi ho gai hoti he or sabhi ko mandaar kii shaadi kii phikr ho jaati he
 Then there are different types of twists in the story in which laughter also occurs and sometimes people are unable to control by seeing the antics like adults
 film kii casting bhi ekadam sateek he,jahaan ek taraf marathi ladke kaa role adaa karte hue gulshan devaiyaa hai to vahiin jyotsna ke ahm kirdaar main mashhoor marathi adaakara sai tamhankar dikhaai detii hai
 Actress Radhika Apte has been given the role of Trupti Gokhale, who lives in Pune, which becomes very important after the interval
 film main kuch aise vaakye hai jo aapako yaad rah jate hai jaise 'RSVP' kaa matlab kya hota he, best or second best kaa antar, Love is Color blind ityadi
 My biggest question is the story of the film, which is only 2 hours and 20 minutes but when it looks too long, it seems that when the morning of this night happens, it would have been even more impressive if it was a little shorter
 vahiin agar aapane trailor ko dekhakar apane man main kai tasviren bana lee hai to aapke sapane film dekhte vakt bilkul bhi sach nahin honge
 Trailer-like food is not served to you in the film
 film kaa khyaal to bahut acha or anokhaa tha lekin ban jane ke baad kaaphi halki script lagati he hunter or film ko dekhne ke baad ek jumala sabase zyada feet baithta he 'naam bade or darshan chote'

 'unhone kaha ki kashmir bharat or pakistan kaa dwipaksheeya maamla he
 Rahmani said that Afghanistan feels that Pakistan is deliberately trying to connect their country with Kashmir issue and it is an attempt to prolong the violence in Afghanistan
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan kaa yah behuda tark he taaki use taliban ke khilaaf koi ection nahin lene kaa bahaanaa mil jaae
 Rahmani further said that Pakistan has no threat from Afghanistan
 aisi koi vajah nahin, jisase yah sabit ho ki pakistan ko pashchimi seemaa par baari taadaad main sena tainaat karne kii jarurat he
 It is worth noting that Pakistan has been outraged by the Narendra Modi government's decision to abolish Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir

 Hence, these products have been banned throughout the state in view of the excessive use of these components in gutkha and paan spices
 Uttarakhand government has put total ban on manufacture, storage, distribution and sale of gutka and pan masala in the state for a year
 Significantly, Uttarakhand is not the only state which has banned pan spices
 isse pehlebihar main bhi paan masaalon par pratibandh laga diya tha
 Bihar's Food Safety Commissioner Sanjay Kumar on Friday said that a total ban on manufacturing, storage, transport, display and sale in packet or open form for a period of one year from today (august 30) across the state is on 12 pan masala companies

 ji haa, asia kii duusari sabase badi jhoparpatti yani dharavi main ab ek jhopade kii kimat 1 karod rupee tak pahunch chuki he
 The price of 1 sq feet has now reached around 25,000 to 30,000, while still some builders in Mumbai are selling their new projects at the rate of Rs 25,000 per sq feet
 mumbai kii sabase badi or asia kii duusari sabase badi jhoparpatti he dharavi

 So far, Dharavi has been surveyed four times, under which cluster development will be seen in Dharavi in the next few years
 haalanki yahaan rahanevaale log itane utsahit nahin hai
 It is worth noting that recently a new project was launched by Loda Builder of Mumbai, which had a flat price of 25000 per square foot
 maujuda market rate se bhi kam daam main project launch karne ke baavjood bhi mumbai ke praparty market kii haalat aaj khasti he
 But in the meantime, the skyrocketing prices of the slums of Dharavi will be less happiness and more of concern for Mumbaikars

 Subrata Roy, who was brought here in police custody from Roy Nelkhanu with folded hands, appeared in a packed court after washing his face stained with black ink and apologized to the judges with folded hands
 unhone sampatti bechakar or bank guarantee dekar sebi ke paas dhan jamaa karaane ke liye or samay die jane kaa anurodh kiya
 The 65-year-old Subrata, who tied the Sahara logo with a white shirt and jacket, tried his best to satisfy the judges and said he would follow all her orders
 unhone dhan jamaa karne ke liye or samay dene kaa anurodh kiya
 All the arguments were not in favor of any kind of softening with them
 nyaayadhishon ne yah dhan sebi ke paas jamaa karaane ke bare main koi thos prastaav pesh karne main vifal rahane ke kaaran roy ke prati kisi bhi prakaar kii dayaa dikhaane se inkaar kar diya
 On one occasion, Roy said that i am giving assurances

 At this, Justice Khehar told Tapak that we do not want anything from you

 Expressing complete confidence in the judicial system, he said that in 37 years he has not been stained and he has already followed all orders
 unhone kaha, mujhe aapmen bharosa he
 If i do not follow your orders, then be punished

 The judges said that we found that even today no resolution has been moved in respect of the judgment of August 31, 2012 of the court and the orders of December 5, 2012 and February 25, 2013 of the three-judge bench
 in paristhitiyon main samvidhan ke anuchhed 129 or anuchhed 142 main pradutt adhikaron kaa istemaal karte hue ham vandana bhargav ke alaava sabhi avmaananakartaon ko hiraasat main rakhane kaa aadesh dete hai or unhen dilli main sunwaayee kii agali taarikh tak ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main bhejte hai
 The concessionaires are women, so the concessionaires said that Bhargava is being given a concession because she is a female director and also so that she can work with the contemptors detained in custody to prepare an acceptable solution to execute our orders
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki avmaananakartaon ko un adeshon par puri tarah amal karne or unke dwaara kiye gaye avmaananaa se bachane ke liye paryaapt avasar diya gaya lekin iskaa laabh uthaane kii bajaae unhone is nyaayalay ke adeshon par amal main vilamb ke liye tamaam hatkande apanaae
 The judges said that the non-implementation of orders given by this court shakes the foundations of our justice system and violates the rule of law, which we have a duty to protect
 jhuthe halafname daakhil kienyaayalay ne kaha ki roy or anya nideshkon ne jhuthe or paraspar virdohi halafname daakhil kiye, jisase niveshkon kaa dhan lautaane ke bare main unki managasaint kahaniyon kaa pataa chalata he or jo tathakthith niveshkon ke bare main hi gambhir andeh paidaa karata he
 The judges said that we found that the contemptors consistently adopted an unfair attitude in the proceedings of SEBI, SAT, High Court and even this Court
 sebi ne 18 farvari, 2014 ko avmaananakartaon dwaara pesh daleelon or dastavej aadi kaa vishleshan karte samay vistrut zikr kiya he jisase sanket miltaa he ki ve lagaataar yahaan tak avmaananaa kii kaarywahi main bhi asweekaarya bayaan or halafname daakhil karte rahe
 For the economic development, this court said that it is very important to maintain the loyalty of the market for the country's economic development and national interest
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki niveshkon kaa bharosa banaae rakhane ke liye bazaar kii nishtha or bazaar ke durupyog par ankush lagaana jaruri he
 Market misuse is a serious financial crime that challenges the financial structure of this country and creates an imbalance between the rich and the wealthless

 The credibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah is at stake in the third phase of Lok Sabha elections
 kyonki modi-shah ke grih rajya gujarat kii sabhi 26 loksabhaa siton par tisare charan main 23 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 For the last two decades, bjp's unanimous rule has been established here
 2014 main bijepi gujarat main clin sweep karte hue sabhi 26 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 But, the way Congress has performed in the 2017 assembly elections
 iske baad loksabhaa chunaav main modi-shah ko apane pradesh main bijepi ke varchasv ko barkaraar rakhane kii kadi chunauti he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not fielded from Gujarat this time, but BJP President Amit Shah is contesting from Gandhinagar seat
 yah seat bijepi ke diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani kii rahi he, jinhen party ne is baar tikat nahin diya he
 Gujarat is considered a BJP laboratory
 aise main narendra modi gujarat main chunavi prachaar karte hue sabhi siton ko ek baar phir se jeetne kii lagaataar apil kar rahe hai
 In the 90s, the BJP established its roots in the politics of Gujarat that till date no one could challenge
 vidhansabha se lekar loksabhaa chunaav tak bijepi kii tuuti bolti rahi
 In 1995, BJP came to power in Gujarat
 2014 main bijepi ko sabase zyada 26 siten mili thi
 Looking at the earlier results, in 1991 BJP had got 20 seats in the account, this was the best result before 2014
 bhaajapa 1996 main 16, 1998 main 19 or 1999 main 20 siten jeetne main safal rahi he
 Let me tell you that when Narendra Modi ascended the power of Gujarat in 2002, BJP seats in the Lok Sabha elections decreased instead of increasing
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 14 or 2009 main 15 siten mili thim
 However, when Narendra Modi became the prime ministerial candidate, the BJP got all the seats in Gujarat
 bijepi ko gujarat main do dashakon main pehali baar congress 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kadi takkar dene main safal rahi thi
 Even though the Congress could not end the exile of power by ousting BJP from power
 lekin gujarat kii raajnneeti main pehali baar bijepi ko 100 ke aakande ko chune nahin diya
 BJP got 99 seats while Congress was successful in winning 81 seats
 jabik bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne gujarat main 150 siton kaa target rakhaa tha
 The Congress had used a trio of three young leaders of the state to surround the BJP in the Gujarat assembly elections
 inamen se dalit netaa jignesh mewaani, patidaar netaa hardik patel or obisi netaa alpesh thakor shaamil the
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had worked hard during this period
 iskaa nateeja tha ki 2014 main bijepi ko jo 59
 In 2017, that figure was 1 percent, down 10 percent to 49 percent
 1 fisadi par aa gaya tha
 While in Modi's Gujarat, the Congress had not suffered much in the Lok Sabha elections in Gujarat
 ab jab loksabhaa chunaav ho rahe hai, to alpesh thakor congress ko alavida kah chuke hai or jignesh gujarat ke bajaay bihar ke begusarai main kanhaiya ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 Whereas Hardik Patel is trying his best to win the Thakar Party, part of the Congress
 congress ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gujarat kii 26 siton main se aadhi siten jeetne kaa target fiks kiya he
 The Congress has planned the mission-13
 ye sabhi siten gujarat ke gramin ilaake kii hai, inamen aanand, amarelli, banaaskantha, sabarkantha, patan, junagarh, dahod, bardoli, surendranagar, jamnagar, porbandar, bharuch or mehsana loksabhaa seat shaamil hai
 In fact, the Congress is focusing on winning these seats because the results in these seats in the assembly elections were in its favor
 iske alaava congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi jis tarah se kisaanon ke mudde ko uthaa rahe hai or garibon ko 72 hajaar rupee salanaa dena kaa vaada kiya he
 This gives the Congress hope of further strengthening here
 jabaki, narendra modi ke liye satta main lagaataar duusari baar apane grih rajya gujarat ko jeetne kii chunauti he
 In such a situation, if the seats fall in the Lok Sabha elections like in the assembly elections, then questions are bound to arise on Modi and Shah

 is ghatana main prashasnic laaparvaahee ke alaava rail prashasan par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 The biggest question is that despite seeing such a huge crowd, why did the loco pilot not reduce the speed of the train? But amidst the questions, the railway has given a clean chit to the driver
 ferozepur ke diarem vivek kumaar ne saaf-saaf kaha he ki loko poilat ko aise haalat main jo kadam uthaane chahie the usne uthaae
 The DRM said that where the accident happened there was a bend, but the light of the train engine was going straight
 aage unhone kaha ki jaise hi train driver ne logon ko dekha usne speed kam kar di
 According to the DRM, the train has a speed recorder, upon seeing it, it is found that the speed of the train was earlier 91 kmph which was reduced to 68 kmph
 lekin train main baithe paisangers kii suraksha ke lihaaj se train nahin roki gai
 The accident occurred within a matter minutes when the train came at a high speed

 So the driver pushed the train forward, and took the train straight to Amritsar

 DRM Vivek Kumar also rejected the claim of Congress leader Navjot Sidhu in which he said that there is no horn in the train
 maatr chaar saal kii umr main ek bal kalakaar ke rup main apane filmi pari kii shuruyaat karne vaali abhinetri shridevi ne kaha he ki vah nahin chaahati ki unki beti jahnavi is umr main filmon main padaarpan kare
 The comments kareeb 15 saal ke baad film ‘english winglish’ ke jariye vaapasi karne ja rahi shridevi ne kaha, filmon main uskaa aana abhi jaldibaji hogi
 She attends me as a daughter, a friend, and i like to bring her in many shows
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki vah filmon main aane ja rahi he
 There are rumors that Sridevi's elder daughter Jahnavi (15) is going to make her acting debut with Karan Johar's Telugu film, which will be the sequel to Sridevi and Chiranjeevi starrer Jagadeka Virudu Athiloka Sundari
 is film ko baad main ‘aadmi or apsara’ naam se hindi main dab kiya gaya tha
 The actress said, it is not that i am trying to push her forward or she likes to be in the discussion
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki kai baar log galat samaj lete hai
 It is notable that Sridevi entered the acting world at the age of four through the Tamil film 'kandan Karunai' in 1967 and later worked in many Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films
 unhone varsh 1975 main apni pehali hindi film ‘juli’ main kaam kiya tha
 Sridevi, who is going to make a comeback after about 15 years with the film 'english Vinglish', said that it is too early for her to appear in films
 kai saare kaaryakramon main vah ek beti, ek mitra ke rup main mere saath aati he or main use laana pasand karti hum
 This does not mean that she is going to appear in films
 gauratlab he ki aisi afvaahen ud rahi thi ki shridevi kii badi beti jahnavi (15) karan johar kii telugu film ke saath abhinay jagat main padaarpan karne ja rahi he, jo shridevi or chiranjeevi abhinit film ‘jagadeka virudu athiloka sundari’ kii sikval hogi
 The film was later dubbed into Hindi under the name 'man and Apsara'
 abhinetri ne kaha, aisa nahin he ki main use aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahi hum yaa vah charchaa main rahanaa pasand karti he
 It is unfortunate that many times people misunderstand
 ullekhneey he ki shridevi ne varsh 1967 main chaar saal kii umr main tamil film ‘kandan karuni’ ke jariye abhinay kii duniya main kadam rakhaa tha or baad main kai tamil, telugu or malayalam filmon main kaam kiya tha
 He acted in his first Hindi film 'julie' in the year 1975

 co / cqhbcsa3gg — VISHAL DADLANI (@vishaldadlani) July 19, 2018 Brahmastra: Ranbir, Alia and Amitabh, who were seen together for the first time, said that till date this video was made available by a user
 jise twitor se share kiya gaya tha
 Be aware that some time ago music director Pritam also discovered a child singing on the streets some time ago in a similar way
 preetam ne june main sikkim ke ek street singer kaa video post kiya tha or soshal media yugers se uskaa pataa lagane main madad maangi thi
 Akshay's Hitler mustache took a pinch, so according to the comparison, he is impressed with Santosh's sarangi tune and will soon include this tune in his music
 bataa den ki pravesh kshetri naam ke you-tub yujar ne 14 june ko santosh kaa video share kiya tha
 It will be seen whether Vishal will also make a music video with this saint? unnav se BJP ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara paanch santo ko rajyamantri kaa darja die jane kaa samarthan kiya he
 When asked about this, Sakshi Maharaj said that it is good that the Government of Madhya Pradesh at least gave the status of Minister of State to saints and not to dissenters
 gauratlab he ki sakshi maharaj khud bhi sant hai or dharmik pravachan karte rahete hai
 Regarding the violence that followed the Supreme Court's decision on the Scheduled Castes Act, Sakshi Maharaj alleged that the opposition parties were deliberately inciting violence by provoking people
 kyonki unhen dar he ki kahin dalit phir se bijepi ke saath naa chale jaaen
 She said that these parties are not concerned about the interests of Dalits but in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, they are doing so
 dalit act ko lekar rahul gandhi bhi lagaataar bijepi par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Regarding this, Sakshi Maharaj said, Rahul Gandhi is constantly spreading confusion about this by making false statements
 sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki vipakshi partiyaan chaahe kuch bhi sajeesh kar len dalit majbootee ke saath bijepi ke saath he
 Because he knows that BJP is always ready to protect his interests
 bijepi netaa ne poocha- kya dakaiton ko mantri kaa darja diya jayega?vahiin, bijepi netaa prabhaat jha ne madhyapradesh main santon ko rajya mantri kaa darja die jane ke maamle par congress ke sawaal uthaane par kaha ki, kya congress party bhi santon ko mantri kaa darja de sakati he? unhone kaha ki agar santon ko mantri kaa darja nahin diya jayega to kya dakaiton ko mantri kaa darja diya jayega
 In fact, the Madhya Pradesh government has opened its box for Abasadhu-saints after handing over the officers and employees in the election year
 madhyapradesh sarkaar ne narmadanand, hariharaanand, computer baba, bhayyoo ji maharaj va yogendra mahant ko rajyamantri kaa darja pradaan kiya he
 a total of 215 candidates have filed nominations from 38 constituencies in Manipur

e
 Wednesday may be special for you
 agar is din aap dilli-ensiaar main maujuud rahenge to aapako unke saath photo khinchvaane kaa sunaharaa mauka milegaa
 Actually Virat will not be there but his statue of wax will be unveiled at Madame Tussauds Museum in Delhi
 is museum main pehle se kapil dev, sachin tendulkar, argentina ke footbal star leonnelle mesi or milkha singh jaisi khel jagat kii badi hastiyon kii pratimaayein hai
 a few months ago, the team from London of Madame Tussauds Museum met with Virat and measured for his statue
 is par viraat kohli kaa kahana tha, 'yah bahut garv kii baat he
 i thank the team Madame Tussauds, who have reminded me of living together for such a lifetime
 'ipel ke baad viraat ne england jaakar county cricket khilne kaa man banaaya tha lekin gardan kii chot kii vajah se unhen ye plan radd karnaa padaa
 On 15 June, Virat will have a fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore and thereafter a decision will be taken to play in T20 and ODI series in Ireland and England
 bataa den ki afghanistan ke khilaaf 14 june se bangalore main shuru ho rahe test match main bhi viraat hissaa nahin le rahe hai
 Although Virat himself will not be present for the unveiling of his statue, but his family members will definitely take part in the unveiling ceremony
 kaashi vishwanath mandir ke garbhagrih main teen pramukh prasadon ke vitaran par roak laga di gai he
 The visitors of the country and the world can only get a glimpse of Baba in the sanctum sanctorum
 vahaan rakshasutra ke taur par bhakton kii kalai par na to mauli baandhi jaaegi, na hi tilak lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Priests of Baba's Charanodak will not give it to the devotees
 dwadash jyotirlingon main se ek baba vishwanath ke garbhagrih kii pavitrataa banaae rakhane ke liye yah vyavastha lagu karne kaa nirnay nyaas parishad ne liya he
 Complaints were received regarding the behavior of priests with visitors in the sanctum sanctorum of Kashi Vishwanath with golden peaks
 shikaayat thi ki dakshina ke laabh ke chakkar main garbhagrih main pujari jise chaahate hai, use mauli baandhte hai or charanodak nikaal kar prasad ke taur par dete hai
 This disrupts the sanctity and dignity of the sanctum sanctorum
 haal main hi nyaas parishad kii baithak main karypalak samiti ke adhyaksh or kuch sadasyon ne suzav diya tha ki charanodak garbhagrih main katai nahin baanta janaa chahie
 The tendency to tie molly in the sanctum sanctorum and apply tilak on the forehead was also objected to
 antat: nyaas parishad ne is prakaran ko gambhirtha se lete hue mukhya karypalak adhikari esake maurya ko nirdesh diya ki ve garbhagrih ke baahar mandir parisar main hi charanodak jamaa karakar bhakton ke bich baantne karaane kii vyavastha karen
 Similarly, in Baba's court, devotees have been instructed to start a new system of tying molly and applying tika-sandalwood
 rajasthan mennotebandiki vajah se pehle hi pareshaan chal rahe kal-kaarkaanon par bijli kii badi keemten doharaa jhatka banakar ai
 Due to this, locks have been installed in more than 100 industrial units of the state and more than 50,000 people have lost their jobs
 notebandi ke baad 70 fisadi tak ghati maangaindustry se jude logon kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke baad har kshetra main kareeb 60 se 70 fisadi tak maang main kami ai he
 In some industrial units which were running, the lockout has started to improve the situation
 kaarobaariyon kii shikaayat he ki majdoor check main vetan nahin le rahe hai, to vahiin mazdooron kaa kahana he ki bank vaale unka khaataa nahin khol rahe hai, to ve check lekar karenge bhi kya
 
 
 Sanctum in industrial areas Sannta Pasara is located in the industrial area of vishwakarma in Sanatarajasthan
 steel kii dhalaai se lekar marble kataai kaa kaam karne vaale saare kaarkaane band pade hue hai
 In one such factory Mangla Industries, the machines are closed and the workers were sitting vacant
 kaarkaane ke maalik ne saat din pehle bijli kii keemat main dogani se adhik badhottaree ke baad taala laga diya he
 Sitaram Agarwal, owner of Mangla Industries, says that due to demonetisation, the work in the industry was reduced to a quarter, but the increase in the price of electricity directly by two and a half rupees per unit broke the back of the power consuming industries
 lihaaja puure rajasthan main kareeb 100 se zyada industries par taala lag gaya he
 Lockout in factories broke the workers' workers
 This lockout is lying on the largest number of laborers
 aage se steel, marble, cement, wood or james-jevailary jaise udyogon se bhi maang nahin aa rahi
 Because of this, up to 40 percent of the workers have been fired
 inamen se jin majudaron kaa bank acount nahin tha, unki tankhwaah ab tak nahin ai he or jinka khaataa tha, unhen kaarkaana maalikon ne puraane note thama die
 But due to his lack of scope in December, the workers are being fired
 mazdooron kaa kahana he ki bank vaale nae account nahin khol rahe hai
 They are saying that they will open a new account only after December 31, otherwise they will turn black money white
 isi vajah se mazdooron kii majaburi he ki unhen nakad vetan hi chahie, check kaa vah kuch kar bhi sakate
 One such laborer of the new name, who came from Cochus in Buxar, Mazdoor Behar, without a bank account, says that if we go to a house, we send cash along with it
 check lekar kya karenge
 At the same time, Prashant, a resident of Bhadohi in UP, says that the owner was giving old money
 khaataa tha hi nahin to kya karte
 So not for ab bankwala kah rahaa he ki janvari main bank main khaataa kholenge
 Explain that in Rajasthan a large number of laborers work in industries like gems, textiles, marble and stones
 lekin in sabhi jagahon par kaam na ke baraabar dikh rahaa he
 The owners of the factories say that apart from not getting further orders, there is a huge shortage of cash in the industry
 sabakaa kahana he ki march ke baad hi samaj aayega ki aage kya hoga

 tarun gogoi pichley 11 saal se assam ke mukhyamantri hai or is dauraan kii apni uplabdhiyon ko ve khud hi matiamet karne main lage hai
 Recently, he told a TV channel that the reason for the growth of Muslim population in the state to be higher than Hindus is not illegal Bangladeshi infiltrators, but illiteracy prevailing among Muslims, due to which they are producing more children
 gogoi kaa kahana he, “adhiktar muslim ashikshit hai
 There are six to ten children in each family
 ”asal main aisa kahkar unhone assam ke muslim bahul jilon main sakshartaa dar badhaane main apni sarkaar kii pragati ko kamatar karke aanka he
 For example the state has the third highest Muslim population (57 according to the 2001 census
 6 fisadi) vaale jile hylakandi kii sakshartaa dar kii baat karen to yah 2001 kii 59
 75 in 2011, up from 64 percent
 26 fisadi tak pahunch gai
 It averages 73 across Assam
 18 fisadi se zyada he
 The population of Hailakandi has also grown rapidly in the last decade
 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik, is jile main jahaan aabaadi 20
 There was an increase of 89 percent, compared to 21 in 2011
 44 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Even the highest Muslim ratio (74
 3 fisadi) vaale dhubri jile main bhi sakshartaa 2001 ke 48
 59 in 2011, up 17 percent
 17 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 The fact is that despite the improvement in literacy in the three top Muslim-majority districts (see table), the decadal population growth rate has increased
 duusari ore, sirf 1
 District Dhemaji 20 with 8% Muslim population
 30 fisadi kii badhat ke saath jansankhya vruddhi ke maamle main saatven sthaan par he
 Gogoi may have said this to mock the organizations seeking to repatriate Bangladeshi infiltrators, but Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has admitted that cross-border infiltration continues
 unhone gogoi kii raay ke vipareet 10 sitambar ko kaha, “hamane ise rokane ke liye kadam uthaae hai, lekin yah ab bhi jari he
 "as a result, Gogoi is facing criticism from all quarters
 bharat main musalamaanon kii saamaajik-aarthik dasha par aitihaasik report taiyaar karne vaali samiti ke pramukh dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise rajinder sachhar ne kaha, “main stabdh hum
 It does not suit any Chief Minister
 isamen koi shubahaa nahin ki musalamaanon main nirakshartaa zyada he, par jansankhya vruddhi ke liye unhen hi jimmedaar tehraana sahi nahin he
 It is the duty of the government to spread education and improve the standard of living of the deprived sections
 aise bayaan dene kii jagah unhen is par dhyaan dena chahie
 "justice Sachar, however, declined to comment on whether illegal infiltration is leading to higher population growth rates in Muslim-majority districts
" is bich, ol india united democratic front ke adhyaksh badaruddin ajmal ne gogoi kaa bayaan aate hi unase turant istipha dene kii maang kar daali he
 He says, "by saying that most of the Muslims of Assam are illiterate, they themselves have accepted that they have failed in their work
 yadi musalamaanon main ashiksha kii vajah se jansankhya bad rahi he to unhone 11 saal main kya kiya he? beatiedi sankat kii jimmedaari bhi sweekaar karne ke baad ab ve mukhyamantri bane rahane kaa adhikaar kho chuke hai
 "but Ajmal's words have not affected the All Assam Minority Student Union (AAMSU)
 use gogoi ke tark main kuch dam dikhataa he
 Abdur Rahim Ahmed, president of AAMSU, says, "his statement gives an idea of the situation of the minorities in the state
 yah sahi samay he ki sarkaar assam ke alpsankhyakon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye jaag jaae
 On the other hand, Gogoi has also found support in the academic circle
 omiyo kumaar das institute of soshal change and deveopment ke diarector bi
 K
 sarama kehete hai, “gogoi ne jo bhi kaha he, use sahi tehraane ke liye sakshya maujuud hai
 Look at the population growth rate of the most literate districts of Assam
 jorhat kii sakshartaa dar 83
 42 percent, but the population growth rate there is only 9
 21 fisadi he
 Dhubri, the district with the lowest literacy, has the highest population growth rate
 ” jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kachaar main 80
 Despite a high literacy rate of 36 percent, there are 20 in the population
 17 fisadi kii vruddhi kyon hui he, to sarama ne kaha, “hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki kachaar main 36
 1 percent of the population is Muslim

 mail todeejucationsumit par kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantriprakash jaavdekarne kaha ki desh main shiksha kaa profit motive nahin hona chahie
 Javadekar's statement came on the question of India Today group chairman Arun Puri
 arun puri ne kendriya mantri se satr ke dauraan poocha ki desh memprivet schoolsessop karne kii prakriya par sarkaar kaa kya sochna he or nijee kshetra main skool kholane par profit motive par sarkaar kii kya raay he
 Prakash Javadekar said that Central School and Navodaya Vidyalaya, two models of government schools in the country, are giving better results than CBSE schools
 vahiin privet skool kaa yah matlab nahin he ki sabhi privet skool achche hote hai
 Javadekar said that while the current government cost of education in government schools is Rs 2000 per student, there are private schools in the country which are providing quality education at a fee of just Rs 300 to 400 per month
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki bharat main shiksha kaa itihaas angrejon ke samay se dekhne kii jarurat he
 In the era of slavery, we started emphasizing on education so that we can be ready to run the country while being independent
 is samay se lekar maujuuda samay tak desh main skulon kii neenv charity ke aadhaar par rakhi gai
 Union Minister Prakash Javadekar argued with the fact that now private schools are increasing in the country
 lekin in skulon kaa profit motive rakhana ek badi bahes kaa vishay he
 The whole society needs to participate in the debate on this subject
 vahiin kya privet skool ko munaafe ke aadhaar par chalaaya janaa chahie ke sawaal par sarkaar kaa sidhaa jawaab he ki shiksha kaa profit motive nahin hona chahie
 On this statement of the Union Minister, Arun Puri asked whether running the school on the basis of social service is not promoting media in the country
 iske jawaab main jaavdekar ne kaha ki yah dharna puri tarah galat he kyonki sarkaar ke aankade bataa rahe hai ki log privet skulon ko chhodkar sarkari skulon main behatar shiksha ke liye aa rahe hai

 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar is mudde par ek kadam aage badhaakar vidheyak laane ko bhi taiyaar he
 'the matter is not of majority vs
 minority' Center said that the matter is not about majority vs
 minority
 yah ek dharm ke bheetar mahilaon ke adhikaar kii ladaai he
 The Center will do what it needs to do to bring a bill in this matter, but the question is what will the Supreme Court do? After this, the Chief Justice said that the Supreme Court will not ignore untouchability, child marriage or other social evils within Hindutva
 Can do
 court is maamle main apni jimmedaari se inkaar nahin kar saktaa he
 'torture has been going on for 1400 years' Three divorces' On the other hand, the Attorney General said that if the three methods of divorce are scrapped, the Center will make a process for it
 ek samudaay yah nirnay nahin kar saktaa ki moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf personal lau ko jari rakhaa jaae yaa nahin
 He said that the matter is not about negotiating the balance of power between men and women
 yah 1400 saalon kii parampara nahin, balki 1400 saal se chalata aa rahaa utpeedan he
 The Attorney General said that what is not a part of religion can be eradicated
 AIMPLB se court kaa sawalisase pehle sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne AIMPLB se poocha ki kya ye mumkin he ki mahila ko yah adhikaar de diya jaae ki vah ek saath teen talaak dene par talaak ko sweekaar naa karen
 This clause can also be included in the Nikahnama, which states that a marriage cannot be broken even immediately after three divorces
 AIMPLB kii adwijuri maanane ko baadhya nahin kaajicourt ne kaha ki is mudde ko tabhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he jab kaazi is mudde ko jamini str tak lagu karen
 However, on behalf of AIMPLB, Yusuf Hatim said that it is not necessary for all Kazi to follow the advisory of AIMPLB

 yani ye tarika duusare maamalon main bhi jari rah saktaa he
 On behalf of Jamiat Ulema-e Hind, advocate Raju Ramachandran on behalf of Jamiat Ulema-e Hind said before the court that it would be a crime if a husband stays with his wife after three divorces
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko hui sunwaayee main ol india muslim personal lau board kii ore se vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha tha ki teen talaak kaa pichley 1400 saal se jari he
 If Ram's birth in Ayodhya can be a matter of faith, then why not the issue of triple talaq
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki islam dharm ne mahilaon ko kaaphi pehle hi adhikaar diye hue hai
 Family and personal law are under the constitution, it is a matter of personal faith
 justise courian joseph ne jab kapil sibbal se poocha ki kya koi i-talaak jaisi bhi cheez he
 Center said- will bring new law
 Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court said that due to lack of time, it will hear only on the issue of triple talaq
 haalanki court ne kaha ki bahuvivaah or nikaah halaala ke mudde par bhi sunwaayee kaa rasta bhavishya ke liye khulaa he
 The central government told the Supreme Court that if the apex court repeals all the methods of divorce including three divorces then a new law will be introduced in the Muslim society for the regulation of marriage and divorce
 centre ne yah bhi aagrah kiya ki bahuvivaah or nikaah halaala ke muddon ko maujuuda sunwaayee se alag nahin kiya janaa chahie
 On this, the Supreme Court assured that all these aspects exist in their place and these will be looked into later
 ham kyon nahin khatm kar sakate teen talaak?sunwaayee ke dauraan mukul rohtagi ne kaha kiagar saudi arab, iran, iraq, libya, misr or sudan jaise desh teen talaak jaise kanoon ko khatm kar chuke hai, to ham kyon nahin kar sakate
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the bench, "we will not leave people isolated if the court immediately repeals the method of divorce
" ham muslim samudaay ke bich shaadi or talaak ke niyaman ke liye ek kanoon laaenge
 Let me tell you that the trial is going on since May 11 for triple divorce
 shuukravaar ko supreme court ne kaha tha ki ham sirf ye samiksha karenge ki talaak-e-biddat yani ek baar main teen talaak or nikaah halaala islam dharm kaa abhinn ang he yaa nahin
 The court will also look at this issue from the point of view whether the fundamental rights of Muslim women are being violated by triple talaq or not

 Under which the Supreme Court ruled to ban the misuse of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes Act-1989

 The Congress was once again targeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha
 unhone raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav ke dauraan kaha ki congress ke 55 saal satta bhoga ke the or hamaare 55 maheene seva bhav ke hai
 Modi said that Congress-free India is not our dream, i am fulfilling Gandhiji's dream, he (gandhiji) only spoke of Congress-free India
 modi ne guuruuvaar ko dhanyavad prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan kareeb dedh ghante tak bhaashan diya
 He said that the reverse thief is scolding the watchman today
 narendra modi ne kaha ki congress kii sarkaar ne sena ko bullate pruf jacket tak nahin di thi or sargical strike karne kaa daawey kar rahe hai
 He said that the soldiers lacked even basic facilities, they did not even have shoes and you talk of surgical strikes
 sena ko taqatvar karne ke bare main congress ne kabhi nahin sochaa
 The Congress acted to ignore the needs of the forces, the country will not forgive it

 uttarakhand bijepi ne aarope lagaaya he ki rajya kii police ne party ke kai netaaon or harish ravat kaa virodh karne vaale congressiyon ke phone tap kiye hai
 Not only this, he has also accused some journalists of tapping phones
 rajya main bijepi ke pravaktaa munna singh chouhan ne kaha ki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat police ne is baat kijankaree dihe ki usne june 2015 se lekar ab tak kareeb 378 phone colls record kii hai
 BJPBJP will also complain to the Governor, alleging that Rawat was constantly involved in the efforts of horse-trading

 The charges were leveled against Harish Rawat, the BJP leader said, 'I believe that the police has done this on the instruction of Nehraish Rawat
 vah virodhiyon par najar rakhana chaahate hai

 ' aisa hota to nahin he
 It has never happened that the entire Delhi Police went on vacation together
 magar kya karen
 When such pictures appear on the streets of Delhi, with 15-15 District Police and 209 police stations, it is doubtful whether there is even a police in Delhi or not? And if it is not even on vacation, then why is there no fear of the police inside the miscreants? In the last six months, there have been 12 shootouts in the streets from one corner of Delhi to the other
 mahilaon or bujurgon kii suraksha ko lekar pehle hi dilli police par sawaal uthte aa rahe hai
 Now when on the road, who, or where, get caught in a shootout, it is not even guaranteed
 ab to lagata he ki khamkha ham log upi bihar ko koste hai
 d-company shooters unnecessarily increase their rate
 parde par shootout ke seen dekh kar anwai tali bajaate hai
 Government of the country will be sitting in Delhi
 chalata hoga desh dilli ke ishaare par
 But nobody runs in Delhi ahead of them
 inhone to mumbai ke shootaron ko bhi maat de di he
 This is not just a picture
 balki ye dilli ke police kamishnar amuly patnayak or puri dilli police ke girte jalaal or iqbaal ke zindaa saboot hai
 In Delhi, who breathes on red and high alert 365 days of the year, in the same Delhi, it will be so easy to sieve someone with bullets in this way, it is a thing beyond thinking
 yaad nahin aata dilli kaa koi bhi aisa konaa bachaa ho jahaan se aisi tasviren naa ai hon
 In this way the trend of shootout on the road has increased so fast that confidence has been lost due to the name of police
 kisi police or kaahe kaa police kaa khauf
 Seeing this shooter, i feel a little from anywhere that it will also have some fear of police-law
 saaf he ki dilli kii naak ye police mukhyalay or is mukhyalay main baithne vaale police mukhiya amuly patnayak or unki force kaa khauf aparaadhiyon ke dilon se jaataa rahaa he
 If this had not happened, it would not have been openly on the road
 tasviren dilli ke dwarka kii hai
 The same Dwarka where pictures of the encounter between the miscreants a few days ago created a shudder
 ye tasviir 24 sitambar kii he
 It was four in the evening
 jagah dwarka mode tha
 There is a wide street scene
 gali ke dayee taraf teen kaaren park hai
 There are only three car parks on the left side
 car ke bich main ek bike bhi khadi he
 There is a good movement on the road towards the front
 dayee taraf sabase aage safed rang kii ek car khadi he
 Another person talks to the person sitting on the driver's seat of the same car and walks towards the front
 uske jane ke baad driver kii seat par bata shaks car kaa darwaja band kar letaa he
 a woman is coming from the front
 par jaise hi mahila car ko cross karne lagati he achaanak wo ghabara jaati he
 At the same time, the car also suddenly starts moving towards the front
 mahila to nikal jaati he
 But the car gets stuck
 kyonki tab tak kandhe par bag latakaae or helmet se cheharaa chhupaae ek ladkaa thik car ke saamne aa jaataa he
 He had a pistol in his hand
 car ke saamne aate hi wo pehali goli car ke front shishe ke andar thik us jagah kaa nishaanaa lekar chalaata he, jahaan par driver baitha hota he
 The next second he shoots from the driver's side window
 driver kii seat par baithe shaks ko ab tak ahsaas ho chukaa tha ki ye us par hamalaa he
 So somehow he tries to drive the vehicle forward
 wo gaadi se us hamalwaar ko bhi kuchalane kii koshish karata he
 But by then, the gun-toting shooter goes up to the roof of the second car in equal measure
 idhar, jaise hi wo chat par chadhataa he
 The person sitting in the car quickly opens the door and runs towards the front holding the waist with both hands
 shaayad use tab tak goli lag chuki thi
 Now the attacker climbs to the roof of the car and targets the running man
 par shaayad chembar main goli funs jaati he
 He fires twice
 iske baad pistal ko check karte hue car se utar kar bhaag jaataa he
 At some distance, there was a bike park of Hamalwar
 wo bike par baithta he or nikal jaataa he
 The person who was shot is named Narendra
 narendra praparty dealer he
 He has an office right in front of where he was shot
 narendra ko do goli lagi
 And these two pills killed him
 zaahir he hamalavar narendra kaa dushman tha or narendra ko thikaane lagane ke liye shooter bheja tha
 This is the twelfth incident of an open shootout on the streets of Delhi in just the last six months
 ab aap hi bataaie
 How far is it right to curse the empty up-bihar? lalit modi bisisiai ko jawaab dene ke liye or samay maang sakate hai
 There are reports quoting sources that Modi may ask the board for some more papers over time
 nilambit ipel kamishnar lalit modi kii bisisiai ke kaaran bataao notice kaa jawaab dene kii miyaad aaj khatm ho rahi he
 That is, today, Lalit Modi will have to present a cleanliness on all the demands placed on him
 vaise to bisisiai ke shokouj notice main lalit modi par kai sangeen aarope hai lekin modi ne bhi vakeelon se salaah lekar bachaav kaa pulinda taiyaar kar liya he
 Significantly, in the show notice, Lalit Modi has been accused of a lot of misdeeds in the bidding of two teams, disturbances in distribution of broadcasting rights, disturbances in the sale of internet rights, Modi's stake in IPL teams, dictatorial attitude in IPL etc
 in aaropon ke sho couj notice ke baad bisisiai ne haal main lalit modi ko ek or shokouj notice diya jisamen england main ipel kii tarj par twanti-20 cricket lig shuru karne kii koshish ke aarope lage
 Lalit Modi made full use of the time he got from the BCCI to prepare a response to these allegations, consulted lawyers and hoped that today he can submit his answer
 halanki aaropon ko lekar bisisiai kaa rukh ab bhi kadaa he or doshi paae jane par modi ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat bhi bisisiai ne kii he lekin modi bhi haar maanane ke mood main nahin
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi is unhappy with the absence of 7 mps of the party during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha on Monday and the party has indicated that the concerned members are likely to be made aware of the unhappiness of the party leadership
 is mudde par party kii aprasannataa ke maddenjar sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal dwaara in party saansadon ko patr likhe jane kii ummid he
 The mood of the party leadership also showed during the party briefing on Tuesday evening when party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi made it clear that the party had taken the matter seriously
 unhone kaha ki agar party saansad jaanboojhkar anupasthit the, to unhen gambhir parinaam bhugatne pad sakate hai
 Significantly, during the last session of Parliament, Congress President Sonia Gandhi had expressed concern over the tendency of Members of Parliament to be absent from the proceedings of the House and expected the mps to have a greater presence in the House
 is sawaal par ki kya congress adhyaksh ne aise saansadon kii koi suchi talab kii he jo unupasthit the, singhvi ne kaha vah maang sakati hai
 He said, "leave it to us
" hamaari apni aantarik prakriya he mudde se nipatane kii
 Everyone has regretted the absence
 yah ek ghor apwaad he or durbhagyapurna he
 Even after joining the NDA, there are many issues on which the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party stand apart
 shivasena ne ek baar phir se ram mandir kaa raag alaapte hue kaha ki bijepi ke paas abhi purna bahumat he or agar aise main ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan nahin hota he to aage phir kabhi nahin hoga
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut from NDTV said that the construction of the Ram temple should be done before the Lok Sabha elections due this year
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party ne bharat ko dhokhaa diya he (chit kiya he)
 For a long time we have been demanding votes in the name of Ram temple
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 se pehle ram mandir kaa nirmaan kaary shuru ho janaa chahie taaki log dharm kii raajnneeti karnaa band kar saken
 Please tell that this statement of Shiv Sena has come at a time when during an interview on New Year recently, PM Modi has clarified that till the legal process is complete, neither Ram temple should be constructed in Ayodhya
 The work can begin and neither can the government bring ordinance on it
 saath hi piem modi ne ram mandir nirmaan kaary main deree ke liye congress ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Earlier too, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had tweeted, 'the Supreme Court has said that Ram temple is not an immediate (trial) case
 piem modi (PM Modi) ne bhi kuch alag nahin kaha
 i congratulate him for clarifying his stand on the matter
 pradhanmantri (PM Modi) kehete hai ki ram mandir ke liye koi adhyadesh nahin laaenge
 Its constitutional meaning is that Lord Rama is not older than the law
 'gauratlab he ki ki ek saakshaatkaar main piem modi se ayodhya main ram mandir ke liye adhyadesh laane ke vibhinn hindutv samoohon kii maang ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya
 In response to this question, PM Modi said that let the judicial process come to an end
 nyaayik prakriya samaapt hone par ek sarkaar ke taur par jo bhi hamaari jimmedaari hogi, ham sabhi prayaas karne ko taiyaar hai
 Be aware that the Shiv Sena has tightened its stand on the Ram temple issue
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne gat maheene maharashtra ke sholapur jile main ek raily main bhaajapa ke sahyogi dalon se ram mandir mudde par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye kaha tha
 What is it that we call love? Tide of emotions, union of two lovers, sensation of mind, uncontrolled beating of hearts or boisterous flow of humanity? Preet or childhood love of childhood
 praudh kaa ganbhiry yaa budhaape kaa sahaara? phir usamen bhi shreshth prem kya? tyaag vaala, samarpan vaala yaa saahchary vaala? paane vaala yaa phir khone vaala? krishna-radha vaala paraloukik yaa phir laila-majanu jaise premiyon vaala loukik
 
 
 
 is main mirabai ke krishna prem ke bina baat aage bad sakati he kya? 'mere to giradhar gopal dusron na koi, jake sir mor mukat mero pati soi' ke andaaj main kiske paas itnaa saahas kii man kii murat se byaah kar le? phir surdaas ji kii gopiyaan, 'birh viyog shyaam sundar ke thaadhe kyon na jare, madhuban tum kat rahat hare' ke andaaj main, bina kuch paane, bina kuch khone ke andaaj main param anand se abhibhoot
 
 
 Then what happens around us? What do we call love? This 'valentine's Day' one? Confined in one day
 uphaar vaala, gulab ke phulon vaala
 
 
 What is this? Probably only love
 
 
 kyonki yah to sarvatra he
 Here and there too
 hamamen se har kisi ne kabhi na kabhi ishk kiya hoga! samaj main aayaa ho yaa nahi
 Something happens in the appearance of this song from a Hindi film that 'love is not done'
 
 
 
 In the style of '
 baavjood iske sachche prem ko nirupit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Despite this unending development of human civilization, and the creation and marking of billions of words
 
 
 sach kahen to prem main hona, or prem ko jeena, prem main jeena, or prem ke liye jeena
 
 
 Everyone has their own different levels
 or inhen sab kii charchaa jab se shabd gadhe gaye, kisi na kisi rup main hota rahaa
 From Hindi film songs to Hindi literature, the narrative of Prem is full of his own interpretations
 'do pal ke jivan se ek umr churaani he
 
 
 From 'I' came to drink the love da cup, in a moment the ladies came
 
 
 ' tak angin rup main
 But the immortality that Prem provided in Hindi literature by Chandradhar Sharma Guleri's 1915 story 'he Said Kahin' found no other example
 yah na keval prem kii balki hindi kii mahanatam kahaniyon main se ek he
 This single story gave Guleri ji immortality in literature
 saal 1960 main bimal raay produxns ne moni bhattacharya ke nirdesan main isi naam se ek film bhi banaai thi, jisamen sunil dutt, nanda, rajendranath, durga khote aadi ne kaam kiya tha
 Regardless of whether you believe 'valentine's Day' or not, but if you want to understand love, then read this all time story 'she Said' by Chandradhar Sharma Guleri
 uske marm ko samajhen
 xxrep 4 * STORY: He had said- Chandradhar Sharma guleri-bade-aces of big cities with the whips of the young men who have got their back peeled and ears caught, we pray that the ointment of the Bambukart people of Amritsar is spoken

 And all over the world goes the nose of the embodiment of guilt, despair and sorrow, then in the tight and lush streets of his fraternity in Amritsar, stopping for each ladder, heaped up a sea of patience and 'bacho Khalsaji', 'hata bhai ji', 'rathna bhai ji', 'aane do lala ji', 'hata bacha'
 
 Saying, he walks through a forest of white flats, mules and ducks, sugarcane and khomache and bhaarewalas
 kya majaal he ki 'ji' or 'sahab' bina sune kisi ko hatana pade
 It is not that their tongues do not move, but like a fine knife, if the old lady does not move out of spite even after repeated reminders, then these are the samples of her refrain, 'hat jaane jane jagege; Move away; Move away, love! Long live it
 ' samshti main inke arth hai ki tu jeene yogya he, tu bhaagyonvali he, putron ko pyaari he, lambi umr tere saamne he, tu kyon mere pahiye ke neeche aana chaahati he? batch ja

 Both went together with the deal
 kuch dur ja kar ladke ne muskaraakar poocha, "teri kurmai ho gai?" is par ladki kuch ankhen chadha kar 'dhat' kah kar daud gai, or ladkaa munh dekhtaa rah gaya
 On the second and third days, both would be found accidentally with the vegetable seller, then with the milkman
 maheenaa-bhar yahi haal rahaa
 Two or three times the boy again asked, 'are you crooked?' And the same 'dhat' was found in the north

 John Abraham, who has done political thriller films like Madras Cafe and Atomic, has been trying to establish himself as a reliable actor for some time and his film Raw has been released in this episode
 ek daur main jab uri jaisi filmein tabartod kamai kar rahi he or wing commander abhinandan kii vaapasi par film producers main tital register karaane kii hode much jaati he, usee daur main robi greval kii ye film andharashtriyata se dur un hajaaron ansang heroj ko salaam karti he jinka desh kii suraksha main bada yogadan hota he par unhen aksar gumnami main hi apni jindagi bitaani padati he
 What is the story? Rahmat Ali i
e
 Romeo is a banker and occasionally performs on stage as an amateur
 apane luks badalane kii kshamta ke chalate ro kii nazar us par padati he or use ro ek jasoos ke taur par hair kar letaa he
 His training starts under Raw Chief Srikanth Rai i
e
 Jackie Shroff
 rahamat kii pahchaan badal chuki he or wo akbar malik ke taur par pakistan pahunchataa he
 There Akbar becomes a top arms dealer and starts sending important information from Pakistan to India
 1971 ke daur main pakistan kii yuddh ko lekar taiyaariyon kii suchanaaen akbar bharat ko bhejtaa he lekin pakistan main iesai officer khudabaksh khan (sikandar kher) ko akbar par shaq hota he or uskaa bhanda foot jaataa he
 After this, India's RAW team brings its spy back and you have to go to the theater to see what Akbar's transformation is like as a Walter
 actingjon abraham or unke critics ke bich ek dwand bhari sthiti he
 Critics believe that he is a limited actor and act with very few expressions
 John believes that he cannot act over and hence his acting is realistic, stagnant and subtle
 yahi sthiti is film main dekhne ko milti he
 John tries to carry the film on his shoulders in different getups, mostly acting with his eyes in scenes
 pakistani adhikariyon dwaara torchar karne par jon ke kirdaar ke liye dard mahasoos hota he lekin film ke zyaadaatar hisse main ek jasoos ke taur par ve darshakon ko wo thrill or tension nahin pradaan kar pate hai jiske chalate ye film baaki behtareen thrilors ke samaksh khadi nahin ho paati he
 This can be called an example of weak writing
 mauni roy ko film main khaas tavajjo nahin mili he vahi jaiki shroff kaa ro chif ke rup main styl or andaaj acha lagata he or jaiki ek baar phir sabit karte hai ki is umr main bhi unki screen pregence kaa koi sani nahin he lekin sabase zyada hairat main daalate hai sikandar kher
 Anupam Kher's son Sikander has managed to catch a local dialect of Pakistan as an ISI officer
 unke screen par aane ke baad se hi film kii raftaar main teji dekhne ko milti he
 It was a pleasant experience to see Alexander in such a character
 unhen dekhakar aap vaaki unase nafrat karnaa chaahate the
 Apart from this, Vitange Raghubir Yadav impresses in his small but important role
 screenplescrinriter cid field ke anusaar, agar aap film ke aakhri hisse ko acha bana paane main kaamyaab hote hai to kai baar film kii shuruaati kamiyaan ko chipaaya ja saktaa he
 The film is similar with Raw
 film kii kahani kaa sabase kamjor paksh iskaa dhimaa first half he or kai baar aisa lagata he ki kuch seens kii film main jarurat hi nahin thi lekin duusare half ke dauraan in seens kii praasangikta samaj aati he
 John is not able to do justice to all his characters due to the film's weak writing
 haalanki second half main film raftaar pakadaney lagati he or film ke kuch seens behad prabhavi ban pade hai
 a good job has been done on the detailing, with the 70s film hearing the news of Prakash Padukone winning the badminton tournament on the radio
 deshbhakti or andharashtriyata ke bich jo maheen rekha hoti he, diarector robi greval uskaa khaas khyaal rakhte hai or film kabhi bhi chest thamping rashtrawaad ke daayre main nahin hoti, usee tarah hi jaise spai thriller film raji kaa content bhi bharat-paak rishton ko lekar kaaphi samvedansheel tha
 After watching this film, you will be forced to think about the lives of those spies whose work is not less dangerous than a soldier but they do not get any recognition or respect
 kuch to aise bhi hote hai jo gumnami main hi apane desh ke liye praan nyochaavar kar dete hai
 If you are a fan of John Abraham and are interested in espionage thrillers, then you can go to see these films as long as you do not have an indifferent attitude towards slow films

 "the members discussed the conclusion of the Mudgal committee's final report and felt that nothing was done wrong by Srinivasan and the allegations leveled against him by some anti-social elements are baseless and aimed at the BCCI," the statement said

 Sanjay Dutt's biopic 'sanju' has a wide-ranging star-cast
 film main ranbir kapur, sanjay dutt ke role main dikhenge
 Apart from Ranbir, it also stars Paresh Rawal, Vicky Kaushal, Diya Mirza, Sonam Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, Manisha Koirala, but did you know that Aamir Khan was also offered a role in the film
 aamir ko film ke diarector rajkumaar hiraani ne sanjay ke papa sunil dutt kaa role diya tha, lekin aamir ne ye role karne se manaa kar diya
 Rajkumar Hirani told in an interview to Outlook - 'aamir is my friend
 main jo bhi script likhata hum, unke paas jarur lekar jaataa hum
 When i told him the story of Sanju, he said that i also do something
 maine unhen sunil dutt kaa role karne ke liye kaha, lekin wo usee samay dangal main ek adhed umr ke vyakti kaa role kar rahe the
 So he refused to play Sunil Dutt
 'SANJU: hoobahoo sanjay kii copy lag rahe hai ranbir, ye 12 tasviren sabutaunhone bataaya ki maine sanjay dutt ko pehle hi yah saaf kah diya tha ki yadi wo koi line badalanaa chahen yaa koi seen hatwanaa chahen to aisa nahin ho paaegaa
 'sanju' will be released on June 29
 sunil dutt ke role main paresh rawal, naragis ke role main manisha koirala or manyata dutt ke role main diya mirza najar aaengi
 Navratri festival has great importance in Hinduism
 ye tyohaar desh ke kone-kone main manaaya jaataa he
 In this festival, Mother Durga is worshiped for the entire 9 days
 is dauraan log 9 dinon tak upwas bhi rakhte hai
 In nine days different forms of Maa Durga are worshiped in Navratri
 navaratri ke pehle din hi kalash sthapana kii jaati he
 Let's know the auspicious time for the establishment of the Kalash and some rules related to it
 kalash sthapana kaa shubh muhuurtanavaratri 29 sitambar se shuru hogi or isi din kalash kii sthapana kii jaaegi
 Kalash to get the blessings of Mother Durga should always be established in proper time
 is baar navaratri par kalash sthapana kaa shubh muhoort subah 6 bajkar 16 minute se lekar 7 bajkar 40 minute tak he
 Apart from this, you can do Kalash installation in the day also
 iske liye shubh muhoort din ke 11 bajkar 48 minute se lekar 12 bajkar 35 minute tak he
 How to do this Kalash in Navratri: Worshiping the Mother Goddess for nine days in Navratri, the mother fulfills all the wishes of her devotees
 navaratri ke pehle din ghat sthapana kii jaati he
 Ghat installation means establishing the urn
 kalash sthapana karte samay nadi kii ret kaa upyog karen
 Add barley to this sand
 iske baad kalash main gangaajal, laung, ilaychi, paan, supaari, roli, kalava, chandan, akshat, haldi, rupaya, pushpadi daalen
 Then say 'bhumaiye Namah' and place the Kalash on the sand with seven grains
 kalash kii jagah par nau din tak akhand deep jalte rahanaa chahie
 Special rules related to Kalash installation - Kalash installation should always be done in auspicious time
 -kalash sthapana karne ke liye pujan sthal se alag ek pate par laal va safed kapadaa bichhaaen
 On this, make an octopus from Akshat and install an urn filled with water on it
 -kalash kaa munh khulaa naa rakhen, use kisi cheez se dhak dena chahie
 If the urn is covered with a lid, fill it with rice and keep a coconut in the middle
 -agar kalash kii sthapana kar rahe hai, to donon samay mantron kaa jaap karen, chalisa yaa saptshati kaa paath karnaa chahie
 - After worshiping, offer both enjoyment to the mother, Clove and Betasha are the easiest and best
 -maa ke liye laal phool sarvottam hota he, par maa ko aak, madar, doob or tulsi bilkul naa chadhayen
 During Navratri, keep your food and diet satvik for the entire nine days
 aap main se shaayad kam hi logon ko 3 april 2015 kaa good friday yaad hoga, jiske agle din yani shanivaar 4 may ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne supreme court jajon ko apane nivas 7 aarasiar par dinar ke liye nyauta diya tha
 Among the invitees was Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph, who not only refused Prime Minister Modi's dinner request, but also questioned the decision to hold such a government event between Good Friday and Easter
 justise courian ne piem modi ko chitthee likhi thi ki jisane media main naa sirf acha khaasaa bavaal khadaa kiya tha balki sarkaar kii dharmanirpekshata par bhi sawalia nishaan khadey kar die the
 The same Justice Kurian is also in the government delegation to Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj who went to Vatican City
 modi sarkaar ne bheja he delygationsushamaa swaraj ke saath kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal ke alaava loksabhaa empi pro kevi thomas, jose mani, anto anthony, conrad sangama or goa ke dipti siem francis disuja hai
 Apart from these, Supreme Court Judge Kurian Joseph, Senior Advocate Harish Salve are also present in the delegation
 ye delygation madar terresa ko sant kii oopaadhi die jane ke kaarykram main shirkat karne ke liye bharat sarkaar kii taraf se bheja gaya he
 Justice Kurien had given PM Modi's secularism in 2015, when the conference of the Chief Justices of the High Court in Delhi started on 3 April i
e
 on Good Friday
 pehle justise courian ne mukhya nyaayadhish justise echel dattu ko patr likhakar aapatti jataate hue kaha tha ki good friday or easter ke aise pavitra dinon main jajon kii conference yojit nahin honi chahie
 On Saturday, the next day of the conference, Justice Kurian wrote a letter to the Prime Minister not to attend PM Modi's dinner and in this, citing secularism that people like to celebrate this kind of festival with their family
 diwaali, dashahra, holi yaa id ke din aise aayojan nahin kiye jate hai or aap bhi nahin chahenge ki aise aayojan hon'
 But his objection was rejected by Justice Dattu
 gauratlab he ki justise dattu ne good friday ke din is conference ko yojit karne ko bhi sahi tehraaya tha
 He had responded to Justice Kurien, saying that we should find the answer ourselves to whom should we give preference over personal interest and institutional interest
 ardhangn, krushkaay boodha vyakti bihar ke champaran ke paas ek nadi ke kinare baitha he, uski ankhen udaasi se nam hai, vah apni chadar us paar baithi ek garib mahila or uske bachche kii ore baha detaa he taaki ve apana tan dhak saken
 This scene of Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi, based on the biography of Mahatma Gandhi, offers perhaps the most touching picture of selfless politics
 vah mahapurush jise ham baapu ke rup main pyaar karte hai or mahatma ke rup main aadar, janaseva ke darshan kaa sarvocch pratik tha
 He gave his all to become part of the crowd of millions of underprivileged
 lagbhag ek sadi baad us peedi ke ucch naitik mandandon ke koi avshesh najar nahin aate- na filmon main, na asal jivan main
 Today, in the midst of the security raised by the public money, the way our leaders are seen flaunting in luxury vehicles while displaying outlandish brands like Prada Prado, it symbolizes that politics has now turned into a private enterprise
 has gone
 khaadi or gandhivadi mulyon kaa dikhaava to '80 vaale dashak main guchi pasand peedi ke raajnneeti ke maidan main utarane se bahut pehle hi gandhi topi ke saath paridrishy se baahar ho chuke the
 This change is reflected in Rajiv Gandhi's speech at the Congress Centenary celebrations in 1985 in Mumbai
 unka kahana tha ki raajnneeti, ''satta or takat kii dallali bhar rah gai he, ye dalal jan andolanon ko saamanti kultantr main tabdeel karne ke liye prashray dete hai
 "yes, there are people who come only to serve the public in politics, but these people have become an exception, not a rule
" saarvajanik jivan main pravesh ab samay or mehnat kaa aisa nivesh he, jisaki fasal raajnneetik udhyamita ke dwaara kaati ja sakati he

 org (liberty institute kaa ek upkram) ne hamaare nirvaachit janpratinidhiyon kii sampatti ke bare main jo report taiyaar kii he vah shaskaon or shasiton ke bich stabdhkaari antar ko ujagar karti he
 In a country where more than 77 percent of the population, or estimated 8
 36 karod logon kii roj kii aamadani sirf 20 ru
 And more than 30 crore people are living below the poverty line, about 50 per cent of Rajya Sabha members and about one-third of the Lok Sabha members have Rs 1 crore
 yaa usase adhik kii sampatti he
 If we add only the assets of the top 10 Rajya Sabha members and 10 Lok Sabha members, then it is a total of Rs 1,500 crore
 se adhik kii baithti he
 Among the losers of the last Lok Sabha election, Nimathungo of Nagaland - whose assets are worth Rs 9,005 crore
 kii he-samet 10 pramukh ummidavaaron kii sampatti 9,329 karod kii he
 Assembly members are far more wealthy than many mps
 30 rajyon main sabase dhani vidhayakon kii kul sampatti 2,042 karod ru
 Has or gaur karne vaali baat to yah he ki in 150 karodpati vidhayakon main se 59 ke paas pan card tak nahin hai
 Now do not start looking for any relation between the economic strength of the state and the bank balance of the legislators
 uttar pradesh main sarvaadhik sankhya main garib hai, kahen ki ek-tihaai se adhik jansankhya yani 5
 90 million people live below the poverty line
 lekin is pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati desh ke 30 mukhyamantriyon main sabase dhani hai
 There are also 113 crorepati mlas in this state
 isi tarah madhya pradesh main 6 karod logon main se 2
 5 crore people are discharging below the poverty line, but this state can be 'proud' of 80 millionaire mlas
 is adhyayan main marxvaadi ek apwaad banakar ubhare hai
 The CPI-M has 301 mlas in 10 states, but only two whose declared assets are Rs 1 crore
 se adhik kii he
 Of the 537 people who contested on the CPI-M ticket, only seven had Rs 1 crore
 se adhik kii sampatti thi, or unamem se paanch to chunaav haar gaye
 As the old saying goes, power gives power and money draws money
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pichley daur ko hi len
 This provided an opportunity to compare property growth
 rajasthan or madhya pradesh main, jahaan bhaajapa satta main thi, ummidavaaron kii ausat sampatti paanch guna bad gai
 Even in Karnataka, where the Congress and the JD (S) of Deve Gowda ruled alternately, the wealth of Congress members increased fivefold
 acchhee baat yahi he ki paisa hameshaa chunaav main safalataa kii guarantee nahin hota
 a total of 365 crorepatis contested the Lok Sabha elections in 2004; Of them, 88 were forfeited, and 114 were in second place
 pichley saal disambar main congress ne ek baar phir yah mahatvapurn sabak siikhaa, jab usne dekha ki dilli vidhansabha chunaav main haarane vaale congressi ausatan jeetne waalon kii tulana main adhik paise vaale the
 But if other things are equal then money is important
 saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita se judi duusari chizon kii tarah hi, ham use hi aadhaar maan rahe hai, jo hamaare rajnatik samudaay ne ghoshit karne kii sochi he
 After all, the revelations made by the candidate about the property are at most followed by the rule of May, 2002 and March, 2003 mandated by the two Supreme Court judgments
 uplabdh soochna main kaaphi visangatiyaan hai
 Out of 542 members of the Lok Sabha, only 522 property details are available
 isi tarah rajyasabha main sirf 215 sadasyon ne apni sampatti kaa byora diya he
 And no institutional arrangements have been made to verify or investigate the information
 na hi ummidavaaron ke saamne sampatti ke strot kaa khulaasa karne kii baadhyataa he, na hi ummidavaaron kii sampatti main satat vruddhi kii ghoshnaa karnaa anivaary he
 For instance, one of the 10 wealthiest candidates in Mizoram did not even have a PAN card, although his assets were worth Rs 1 crore
 se adhik kii he
 Even more worryingly, although mps who are ministers give annual details of their assets, that information is not available to the public
 asal main yah tathy padtaal kii us avadharana ko hi nakaar detaa he, jo satta ke durupyog ko roak kar sampatti jamaa karne par ankush laga saktaa tha
 Of course, what should have been publicly available is not being given even under the Right to Information Act
 yah dukh kii hi baat he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke karyaalay-jo eemaandaaree kaa sarvocch pratik mana jaataa he-ko bhi soochna na dene ke faisle main shaamil kar liya gaya he
 And the worst thing is that while the Union Ministers have to give details of their assets, there is no such obligation before the Ministers of the States
 phir bhi satta or sampatti kaa yah vyabhichaari saath puure rajnatik paridrishy main vyaapt he
 This rift between declared property and reality is so obvious that it cannot be ignored
 oonche padon ke liye chune gaye netaaon kii ghoshit sampatti or unki vilasita bhari jeevanstyli ke bich ke antar ko dekhie to aapako virodhabhas sahaj hi samaj main aa jayega
 So obviously the benami property has not been touched yet
 aise desh main, jahaan pratibha ko anuroop avasar nahin mil paata, raajnneetik satta nitiyon main her-pher or badlaav ke jariye netaaon ke liye sone kii khan tak pahunchane kii seedhi ban jaati he
 The living rooms of the middle and upper middle class are full of discussions about whose son, daughter or son-in-law is taking the benami way to accumulate movable or immovable property
 sarkaar ke liye pichley vishwaas mat ke dauraan sansad main laharaae gaye note, rajasthan or madhya pradesh main pichley chunaav ke dauraan chalaa hawaii abhiyaan, dami ummidavaar khadaa karne par kharch kiya gaya paisa, party karyaalayon ko diya gaya paisa, toyota esayuvi main yatraaen, jisamen ek baar kaa kharch hi 75 lakh ru
 Sits, and private charter aircraft used by politicians for travel across the country are indicators of richness that are hard to ignore
 bank adhikari or dalal korporate ghotaalon ke bare main koi bahut dabi jabaan main baat nahin karte
 Speculation about at least two airlines, the benami ownership of many real estate enterprises, pharmaceutical units and infrastructure companies and the people who actually benefit from it is also hot
 sleeping partner (niskriy saajheedaar) kii korporate jagat kii avadharana ko raajnneeti kii duniya main nai vyakhya mil gai he
 As long as the source of real income, wealth and money received by the leaders remain opaque, the administration will continue to suffer its consequences and will be kept in the account of democracy liabilities on the balance sheet of development

 Doing this is not only fatal for the challenge taker, but it can also prove fatal for others traveling on the road
 kisi bhi pole kii sateekta maapne ke kai tareeke hai
 But the first criterion should be whether the correct winning team is estimated in that survey? This is the strike rate the surveyors talk about in their conversation
 yani surveykshanon main kitni baar sahi vijeta kaa anumaan lagaaya ja sakaa he
 These strike rates broadly give an idea of which party is going to win the election
 haa par kitni site jeet paaegi iskaa byoraa nahin hota he
 If we look at the total surveys and their fallouts before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the picture looks different
 mashhoor patrkaar pranay roy apni kitabad vardict (hindi main bhartiya janadesh) main likhte hai, "1980 ke baad desh main kul 833 surveykshan hue hai, isamen strike rate 75 fisadi kaa rahaa he
 That is, three out of every four polls have been proved correct
 " roy ke bataae iff 833 surveykshanon main opinian or eczit donon surveykshan shaamil hai or ye loksabhaa or vidhansabha donon ke liye kiye gaye hai
 Roy further writes, "exit poll accuracy, based on strike rate, is superior to opinion poll
 eczit pole har paanch main se chaar baar sahi nateezon kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 "if we ignore the results of the 2004 Lok Sabha election, most of the polls show correct and accurate results
 pranay roy likhte hai, "sahi vijeta bataane main strike rate ke maamle main 2004 ke surveykshanon ko chhod den to pole 97 fisadi baar sahi hue hai
 In 133 Lok Sabha surveys conducted since 1980, including 34 conducted in 2004 (16 exit and 18 opinion polls), the strike rate is low
 par 2004 ke 34 pole ko hataa den, to yah kariban sau fisadi sahi vijeta bataate hai
 "these figures do not mean that the number of seats should also be accurate
 yah aankade mahaj sahi vijeta kaa anumaan lagane ke hai
 In this context, almost all exit polls in 2019 are predicting the same winner and that, the next government at the Center is going to be BJP
 ab in eczit pole main koun agency in vot share ko siton main tabdeel karne ke apane prakriyaaon or pravidhiyon ke paalan par hi bhavishyavaanee kar sakati he
 There may be a reshuffle in the number of seats if there is a flaw in the calculation
 duusari baat ki sankhyikeey gananaaon main or chunavi purvanumaan lagane main maanak vichlan (standard daviation) kaa paalan karnaa vaishvik chalan he
 This means that the estimate of votes should have a maximum accuracy limit of + / - 3%
 kai pole apane vot share kaa aankada jari nahin karte hai
 In this case, this standard deviation has to be checked in a + / - range
 roy likhte hai, "loksabhaa chunaavon main 1 fisadi vot kii badhat kariban 10-15 siton main badlaav laa detaa he
 As a result, there is a loss of + / - 3% in the calculation of votes, and in this range the forecast is made
 siton ke maamle main ise dekha jaae to yah mote taur par + / - 35 siton ke rup main dikhataa he
 For example, suppose the winner gets 300 seats
 to koi surveykshan sateek mana jayega, agar iske purvanumaan main vijeta ke liye siton kii sankhya 300 se + / - 35 loksabhaa siten hon
 Therefore, if a survey is giving a range of 265 to 335 seats in its forecast, then it should be considered accurate
 "sawaal yah he ki surveykshanon main siton kii bhavishyavaanee vaastavik chunavi nateezon ke kitne nikat hoti he? pranay roy ke mutabik, "loksabhaa chunaav ke sateek surveykshan (vaastavik siton ke nattejey + / -35 siten) aaj tak mahaj 54 fisadi rahe hai isse bhi adhik hairat kii baat to yah he ki opinian pole kii yah kam sateekta dar loksabhaa ke eczit pole ke niraashajanak pradarshnon kii tulana main kuch nahin he, jisamen sateekta dar mahaj 27 fisadi he
 "simply put, only 27 per cent of exit polls are able to tell the exact number of seats
 haa, loksabhaa chunaav koun jeetegi, yah bataane main unki kamyaabi kii dar kaaphi oonchi hoti he
 That is, people can wait till May 23, who feel that the number of seats is being seen by the BJP to an extent

 Police arrested one of the Territorial Army personnel and two others following complaints from relatives of the victims, but the incident led to unrest and mass demonstrations across the Kashmir Valley, killing 123 people

 Hello, Ravish Kumar

 At times it seems that it is better to have a debate here than that there should be discussion in the joint session of Parliament for weeks and once again come to the conclusion that what kind of nation India is and what it should be like, but such interpretations then Also will not and should not be closed
 aaj kii yah charchaa indian express kii report se prerit he
 According to reporter Ritu Sharma, the Gujarat government has told the government schools that Dinanath Batra's book can be read as a supplementary text or reference book
 ye sabhi course kaa hissaa nahin hai, na hi anivaary hai
 Dinanath Batra wrote nine books on moral values in Hindi in 1994, but this year Gujarati editions of these books have been launched
 gujarati anuwaad kii kitabon main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi or shiksha mantriyon ke sandesh hai
 There is also a complete introduction to Dinanath Batra within the cover
 rajya kii hazaron skulon main ye kitaaben rakhi jaaengi
 There are many people in our country, including Batra, who believe that the modernity that is going on at the moment is Western and due to that there is a huge decline in moral values
 isi sandarbh main express akhbaar tejomay bharat se ek prasang note karata he jisamen bacchon se ummid kii jaati he ki ve apane janmdin par mombatiyaan na jalaayen, ye paashchaatya samskruti he
 Rather, wear indigenous clothes on this day, perform havan and pray to your Ishta Dev
 gaoo mata ko roti khilaaen
 End the day by listening to the songs of Vidya Bharati
 batra ji kii baat se hamaara middle class kaa ek hissaa bidak saktaa he par kyon na yah prayog usee middle class par pehle aazamaaya jaae jo zyada berth de manaata he
 Why should one expect such from the children of government schools
 middle class or public skulon ke bachche jahaan se soshal media janareshan ke first time voter banate hai, kyon na unase kaha jaae ki tum ye miki mouse yaa donald dak vaale berth de kek kaatna band karo
 Do not blow candles, do not give return gifts, do not wear expensive clothes
 agar ve aisa karenge to indian culture ko damege kar denge
 It is not known whether the middle class of TV will contribute some contribution towards Indian culture or not
 vaise main to nahin karuunga par charchaa he to aap darshakon se puch rahaa hum
 You know that the village has reached Cake Birthday
 kaash ye sarkaar or ye kitaab pehle aa gai hoti to kek or chaaumin kaa aisa prasar kabhi nahin hota
 Relax
 ye kek virdohi program nahin he
 Batra ji is raising the matter in a context
 tivi main yah khatra rahata he ki sandarbh gaayab ho jaataa he
 We quickly reach a conclusion
 koi kanoon kii vakaalat nahin ho rahi he balki aapke bacchon main achche vyaktitv ke iraade se yah sab likhaa gaya he
 But i would like more clarification from Batra on one thing
 batra ji kii ek kitaab tejomay bharat main 14 agast ko rashtriya avkaash kii vakaalat karte hai
 Pakistan was formed on 14 August
 batra ji chaahate hai ki is din akhand bharat smriti diwas manaanaa chahie
 In Indianisation of education, Batra asks the children a question how you will make a map of India
 kya aap jaanate hai ki pakistan, afghanistan, bhutan, tibet, bangladesh, srilanka or burma avibhajit bharat kaa hissaa he
 All these countries are part of united India
 avibhajit bharat hi satya he
 Divided India is a lie
 bharat kaa vibhaajan prakritik nahin tha or ise dobaaraa joda ja saktaa he
 If a China incorporates four to five katha land of Arunachal Pradesh in its map on its website, then there is a ruckus in the country and what will happen if we take a holiday on August 14 and celebrate Akhand Bharat Smriti Day
 vaise 14 or 15 agast ko chuttee ho isamen problem he kya
 Big Bazaar will sell on August 15 as well as August 14
 par bacchon ko aisa nakshaa bananaa sikhaayen jisamen pakistan, afghanistan, nepal, tibet, bangladesh, srilanka or burma shaamil ho to kya ho
 This is question
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki aapke bachche india kaa maujuuda nakshaa bhul jaayenge
 But if they make such a map in which even those countries have their own existence, then how will their understanding of India's neighboring countries become
 ek impact ye ho saktaa he ki ve india ke saath afghanistan, pakistan ko bhi pyaar karne lagen par srilanka or nepal ne hallaa machaa diya to
 That is why i am saying that this is not an ordinary thing
 yah baat hamen rashtrabhugol or smritiyon ko lekar bani banaai yaa ban rahi raajnneetik samaj ko chunauti detii he
 i asked for books from Batra
 unhone di bhi, lekin sho se pehle ve kitaaben nahin mil pain jinase express akhbaar ne kot kiya he
 By the way, most of the references of these books are good
 kisi ko khaas dikkat nahin honi chahie
 You will say why are you discussing Dinanath Batra's book or moral education collections
 kyonki ve rashtriya swanyasevak sangh kii vidya bharti project ke ahm hasti hai
 The Sangh and the government are seen as siblings because of the Modi government
 deenanath batra ke cese karne par is saal vaindi donigar kii hindutv par likhi kitaab kaa vitaran rokna padaa jise lekar bada baari vivaad bhi hua
 So in this context too, Dinanath Batra becomes more comprehensive than the current context

 Shubhi, who was found hanging from the ceiling of her room, was rushed to Fortis Hospital, where doctors declared her dead
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he, lekin use kai sawaalon ke jawaab talashne hai
 Police said that no succulent note was found from Shubhi's room
 ab tak yah bhi pataa nahin chal sakaa he shubhi ne aisa kyon kiya
 After getting information from the police, Shubhi's family has also reached
 police ne shubhi ke flats kii chaanbin kar tafteesh shuru kar di he
 Police said that there are two such questions in the case, which turn the needle of suspicion to his friends
 pehla sawaal yah he ki uske doston ne shubhi kii maut kii soochna police ko kyon nahin di
 And the second question is why common friend Anshuman called Utkarsh and said that Shubhi's head was hurt

 bharat kaa pehla muqabla bangladesh se he
 After suffering embarrassing defeats in South Africa and New Zealand, the Indian cricket team will now be in the field with the new captain
 naye captain viraat kohli or team ke liye yah badi pariksha he
 It remains to be seen how much both the team and the captain will pass in their exams
 haalanki vipakshi team bangladesh bhi apane ahm khilaadiyon ke chotil hone ke chalate kuch kamjor najar aa rahi he
 But he will definitely get the benefit of the home pitch
 pichley asia cap main bhi do siries harkar pahunche thepanch baar kii champion bhartiya team lagaataar shrinkhlaayen harkar yahaan pahunchi he
 Last time in 2012 too, after losing eight consecutive Tests to England and Australia, the Indian team came to play Asia Cup
 is baar dakshin africa ne bharat ko test main 1-0 se or vanade main 2-0 se haraaya, jabaki newjiland main bhi test or vanade main haar jhelni padi
 However, Virat Kohli & Co
 will be expected to register their first win in 2014 against Bangladesh, struggling with their own problems
 bangladesh ke salaami ballebaaj tamim ikbaal chot ke kaaran toornament se baahar hai, jabaki harfanmaulaa shaakib al hasan tivi par abhadra ishaare ke kaaran do maichon kaa pratibandh jhel rahe hai

 iske alaava chayan vivaad ko lekar bhi bangladesh surkhiyon main rahaa he
 Captain Mushfiqur lashed out at the chief selector and said that he was not consulted while choosing the team
 bangladesh ke khilaaf kohli kaa ausat 122 kabhartiya team chotil captain mahendra singh dhoni or suresh raina ke bina yahaan ai he

 Kohli, who captained Dhoni for the first time in the tri-series against West Indies and Sri Lanka, has won 7 matches as captain, while losing one match
 asia cap haalanki unke liye kathin chunauti he or pakistan ke khilaaf do march ko hone vaala match kaaphi dabaav vaala hoga
 Regular Test player Cheteshwar Pujara will strengthen the middle order
 bhartiya khemaa yah bhi chahega ki vah test model se nikalakar simit overon ke model kii jaruraton ke anusaar khud ko jaldi dhaalein
 Binny will work as a finisher Dhoni! Kohli will bat at number three and Ajinkya Rahane at number four
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki pujaara kis kram par khelte hai
 There is a lack of match finishers in the team, like Dhoni in times of crisis due to concern for India
 ipel main aakraamak paariyaan khilne vaale dinesh karthik ke paas vanade main khud ko sabit karne kaa mauka he, jabaki nichle kram main ravindra jadeja or aar aswin par bhi dabaav hoga
 In such a situation, India can try Stuart Binny as a finisher who is also a useful medium fast bowler
 bangladesh ke liye chunauti aasaan naheepichhali upavijeta bangladesh ke liye is baar chunauti aasaan nahin he
 Tamim's injury has led to a major crisis in batting, while the problem of Bangladesh has increased due to Shakib not playing against India and Afghanistan
 imrul kayes ne disambar 2011 ke baad se vanade match nahin khelaa he jinaki team main vaapasi hui he

 a month has passed since the Yogi government came to power in Uttar Pradesh
 sarkaar kaa daawa he uttar pradesh main sarkari skulon or uski sthitiyon main sudhaar aa jayega
 But before that it is necessary to know how is the current state of government schools in Uttar Pradesh? To date, the team reached Kanpur and Utrao district to do realitycheck to take stock of the government schools in the state
 ummiido se bhi pare in sarkari skulon main vah tasviir dekhne ko mili, jo uttar pradesh main sarkari skulon ko lekar kiye jane vaale tamaam bade-bade daavon kii pole kholti he
 The first school reaches the primary school of Kanshiramnagar on the kanpur-unnao road
 skool ke praangan main bane sarkari nal ke neeche chote-chote bachche mid de mile khaane ke baad apni thali khud hi dhote hue dikhaai die
 Significantly, the Principal of the school, Anand Kumar, also came to see us, but when we asked the children to wash the dishes, they started answering questions
 pradhanacharya kaa kahana he ki bachche mid de mile khaane ke baad sirf apni juuthan thaliyaan saaf karte hai or uske baad rasoiyaa baaki bartan dhota he
 The school education administrator started crying due to lack of staff in the school
 itnaa hi nahin skulon ke andar tasviren dekhakarshiksha vyavastha kii ore sarkaarake daavon se aapako chidh hone lagegi
 The school has 4 rooms, but in these rooms there are neither benches nor tables for reading for young children
 chote-chote bachche chatiyon par baithkar padhate dikhaai die
 Second school: After reaching the government school in Kanshiram Nagar, Kanpur, we reached forward in the village of Gerepurwa in Unnao district
 shaharon kii sthiti ke mukaable gaanv main sarkari skulon kii sthiti zyada badtar he
 The picture here is not much different from Kanpur
 yah sabhi bachche jameen par bichhi chataayee par baithkar padhate najar aae
 The school has a poor education system
 This government school has a total of 3 teachers, with one Principal as an Assistant Teacher and 1 Shiksha Mitra
 lekin jab ham pahunche to shikshamitra skool main maujuud nahin thim
 The Principal himself told that the Shiksha Mitras are on leave for their family reasons and the whole of the children are on these 2 teachers
 teesraa scoolgarerepurva ke baad skulon ke rielity test ke liye ham unnav jile ke kanawapur gaanv ke praathmik vidhyalay main pahunche
 All the three teachers studying in the school were present here
 lekin skool ke kamaron kii tasviir niraashajanak thi
 Same condition as found here
 buniyadi jaruraton kii kami par jab hamane sawaal poocha to pradhanacharya samet baaki donon mahila shikshikaayen prashasan or sarkaar dwaara sarkari skulon kii ore dhyaan na dene kii tasviren saamne rakhane lageen
 The school education teacher said that he has taught the children to write the names of the fruits and vegetables of the animals, but when we asked the children the names of the oranges in English, the children of the fourth grade were unable to answer even the names of bananas in English
 Knew
 ek bachche ne yah bhi kaha ki use falon ke naam angreji main nahin pataa he
 The nose is called nose in English, but some children knew it, but children know nothing about the letters in English of nose
 chauthaa schoolham or aage bade or unnav jile ke hi murlipur gaanv main pahunche
 On arriving at the school, it was found that the headmaster was on leave
 skool main shiksha mitra or sahaayak shikshak aaen to hai lekin pradhanacharya mahoday maujuud nahin the
 Like the rest of the previous schools, there is neither a bench nor a table for the children studying in the school
 jameen par bichhi gandi chataayee or uttarapradesh kii agali peedi apana bhavishya mitti main sunaharaa karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 To reach the level of poor education system education in school, we arrived in class eight, we asked students the names of any five fruits in English
 badi mehnat karne ke baad bhi pehali chaatra jawaab nahin de pai
 When we asked another, the answer ended with a mistake on papaya after orange and banana
 is class main hamane aathvin kaksha kii ek or chaatra se kitaab kaa angreji main matlab or uske angreji main akshar puuchhen lekin jawaab nahin mila
 We also wanted to know the multiplication tables of 17, 16 and 14 from a girl of class VIII but did not get an answer
 aathvin kaksha ke ladakiyon ke baad ab ladakon kii baari thi
 The names of the five fruits in English also did not come out correctly
 haalanki class main ek bachche ko sharir ke 5 angon ke naam akshar ke saath angreji main bakhubi pataa the
 We asked the students of class VI to read the first page of their English book
 aapako jaankaar tajjub hoga kii puri class main sirf do bacchon ne haath uthaaya jo kitaab padhane main khudako samarth maan rahe the
 And when we questioned the teacher on the methods of such studies, her question was also very round and useful
 kul milakar kanpur or unnav main sarkari skool rielity test main fail ho gaye
 Government schools in Uttar Pradesh neither have basic facilities nor better education facilities for children
 
 In such a situation, the next generation of Uttar Pradesh is currently seen in darkness

 He was produced in court on Saturday

 'she was on the run since the child's parents lodged a police complaint on Wednesday
 sisitivi footage main mahila bachche kii chaati par laat maarthe hue dikhaai pad rahi he
 At the same time she brutally bangs the child's head on the bed, while the child is begging for mercy
 police ne mahila ko manorogi qaraar diya he, kyonki vah apane or sambandhiyon ke bacchon kii bhi behad berahami se pitayee karti he
 The incident was condemned everywhere
 yahaan tak ki rajya bal kalyaan mantri shashi panja ko mukhyamantri karyaalay ko is ghatana kii report saunpny padi thi

 While issuing the election manifesto of the Congress, while answering media questions, Congress President Rahul Gandhi clarified his decision to contest from Amethi from Wayanad in Kerala
 aarope lag rahe hai ki rahul gandhi ne ek aisi seat ko chunaa he jahaan hindu voter duusari siton kii tulana main kam he
 Rahul said that his contesting from Wayanad is a response to the neglect of the Modi government of South India
 rahul ne kaha ki dakshin bharat ke logon main is tarah kii bhaavana he ki narendra modi sarkaar ne unhen vikaas main hissedaar nahin banaaya

 This is the reason that when the news of Rahul contesting from Wayanad came, the BJP described it as an escape from Amethi for fear of defeat and targeted Rahul
 haalanki congress or uske netaa lagaataar ye sandesh dene kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki rahul kaa vynad se ladanaa sirf ek seat par jeet kaa masalaa nahin he balki puure dakshin bharat main congress ko majboot karne ke party ke mishan kaa hissaa he

 Apart from this, there are many things in a woman's life that are important

 i am straight forward and believe in openly answering
 upi chunaav main sapa ko mili jabardast haar ke baad apane pehle intervyuu main party ke varisht netaa ajam khan ne is janadesh ko musalamaanon ke khilaaf bataaya he
 He said that during this time, such slogans were also raised that 'modi-modi will have to say or stay in Pakistan'
 unhone kaha ki agar bharat main agar musalamaanon se itani hi nafrat he to hamako vot karne kaa adhikaar kyon diya gaya, hamase yah bhi adhikaar chin lenaa chahie
 Highlights of this conversation are presented to Azam Khan: In Uttar Pradesh, this election was not held against democratic values on democratic values
 yah aisa nahin laga ki ek dharmanirpeksh pradesh kaa chunaav he
 This mandate is against Muslims
 camel chahie yaa quran chahie, shmashaan chahie yaa kabristaan chahie in muddon par chunaav hua
 Seeing the results, the heart sits with fear and does not realize how many powers have come and the transfer of lost power has happened, but this time when the power has changed, the heart is sitting with fear
 naa jane kitne karodon kaa dil dard dar se baitha ja rahaa he, khaufjada he
 Where Muslims should go, 'modi-modi must say or stay in Pakistan' slogans like this during the election
 to ham yah kahana chaahate hai ki pakistan ko taiyaar bhi karen ki hamen kabool kare, ham kahaan jaaenge?kaam ko apni aukaat pataa chaliyah doosraa mauka he jab kaam ko apni aukaat pataa chali he
 It was the first time ND Tiwari was a loser and now it is the second time
 kitna kaam hua, par logon ne kaam nahin dekha
 Do not talk about work, as far as misrule is concerned, BJP has spread wrong things about Badaun case and it has gone to the United Nations
 yah failaayaa gaya ki gunde or aparaadhiyon kii sarkaar he
 BJP gave tickets to abusive criminals, BJP gave tickets to 180 serious criminals and 140 of them have won
 mere mukhyamantri ne aparaadhiyon ko tikat nahin diya, isaki bhi logon ne sajaa di
 At night, i said it and punished me
 chunaav ke nateezon par ungliyaan uth rahi hainateezon par ungliyaan isliye uth rahi hai, kyonki jo itihaas main kabhi nahin hua vah is baar hua he
 This is the reason why the fingers are getting up
 kai jagah to vot pratishat se zyada vot pade
 The BSP and the AAP are determined to fight this battle and are also getting support
 videshon main yah system kyon nahin he? japan main yah system kyon nahin he? yah bhi charchaa soshal media par chal rahi he
 Even if TV channels do not pick it up
 musalamaanon ne bijepi ko nahin kiya votjo ungliyaan uth rahi he usko dabaane ke liembhzf ne yah batfailaai he
 If this were true then why are Muslim women afraid? Why do Muslims panic? After all, why are mosques covered when the procession is out in some cities? Why was such an atmosphere of hate created? If we are really so good then why did BJP not give a single ticket to Muslims? Why does Modi not fulfill his promises? Modi is great, Sufi is a saint, but then why does he not fulfill his promises? Who salutes Modi's greatness? i wish he remembered his greatness even when he was talking about Ramadan and Diwali? Did he remember his greatness when he was talking about cemeteries and crematoriums? Snatch the franchise from Muslims
 If Muslims hate India so much, then why give us the right to vote? If we take away this right from us, we will also be very happy
 ram chahie, rahim chahie , ye koun kar saktaa he? yah baat kabristaan or shmashaan kisne kahi, diwali or ramajaan par kisne sawaal khadey kiye? sirf musalmaan bacchon ko laptop diya gaya yah kisne kaha?modi ji janata ko uskaa paisa denaapane apana vaada puraa nahin kiya
 You promised to bring back black money, put it in people's account
 aap apana vaada puraa karen
 You are not able to return me money by my means

 On this whole issue, Parasena says that we are getting a lot of messages from Pakistanis

 First, Lal Krishna Advani instructed Narendra Modi
 iske baad shivasena saansad sanjay raut ne modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aaj kaa din sanyam rakhane kaa din he
 This day is not for hot words

 In such a situation, we should show ourselves united

 It is wrong to do this day
 narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne kaha ki swatantraaa diwas jaise din netaaon ko ek-duusare kii aalochana nahin kerani chahie
 Significantly, in his speech on Independence Day in Bhuj, Narendra Modi criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 laalkrishna adwani ne kaha, ‘maine aaj pradhanmantri ko suna
 On the occasion of Independence Day, today, without criticizing anyone, we should all feel that India has unlimited potential for the future
 ’adwani apane awaas par rashtriya dhvaj ko fahraane ke baad samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 Shortly before this, the Chief Minister of Gujarat addressed an event in Bhuj on the occasion of Independence Day, in which he attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 bijepi sansadeey dal ke pramukh adwani ne bhavishya ke bare main ashaavadi najariya apanaaya
 Advani said, 'india has unlimited potential for the future
 hamen jitna ho sake, sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa chahie
 Regarding the book on black money, Advani said, "the theme of the book is that although capitalism is good, but if ethics and morality are ignored and people get involved in corruption, then it defames capitalism
" ’adwani ne jor diya ki logon ko aisa kaam karnaa chahie ki koi unpar ungali nahin uthaae

 - Input IANS viipi industries kii emdi radhika piraama ne kaha he ki ve bachapan se hi bosi or aatmavishvasi rahi hai
 Perhaps this is why she became lesbian
 haal hi main hue ek CMO summit main radhika piraama ne kaha ki skool ke dinon main ve ladakon se compit karti thim
 She was bossy, smart and confident
 unki chhavi kisi tombvaay kii tarah thi
 Everyone used to praise him
 jab ve 15 saal kii thim tab unhen pehali baar laga ki unhen ladkiyaan acchhee lagati hai
 At that time, he had told his sister first and then to the family
 haalanki unke parivaar ko ye jaanakar hairaani hui thim or isse pehle ki ve unhen kuch samajhaate, ve oxford padhane ke liye chali gayi
 The domineering IPS officer of UP is wreaking havoc on 'romeo', pointing to the women sitting in the audience, saying that women know how difficult it is to find a right partner
 or agar aap lesbian hon ye kaam or kathin ho jaataa he kyonki aapke paas vikalp or kam ho jate hai
 To prove rape in this country, 4 witnesses are needed, women in worse condition! After Oxford, she went to Harvard Business School and married and joined the company in New York
 landan main 2011 main apni shaadi kii tasviren dikhaate hue unhone kaha ki ve tab pareshaan ho gai thim jab unke pita ne unhen bharat aane ko kaha
 He had doubts about whether he and his partner would be adopted in India
 whatsapp ne haal hi main ek aisa feechar launch kiya he jiske tahat bheje gaye massej waapas le sakate hai
 Actually, it gives the option to delete, which can delete messages on both the sender and receiver
 lekin ek tarika jisase delit kiye hue massej bhi dekhe sakate hai
 This can be called a backdoor or whatsapp feature
 spain ke android blog android jeffe ke mutabik software ke jariye delit kiye gaye whatsap massej ghanton baad tak padhe ja sakate hai
 This report states, 'we have found that the messages are stored in the notification register of the Android system
 isliye aapako bas record dekhne kii jarurat he or delit kiye hue massej bhi aap pard paaenge’udhaaharan ke taur par aapane kisi ko whatsap massej bhejaor phir delit kar liya he
 But the person who sent the message has an Android smartphone, so he can also read your deleted messages through the notification settings
 is blog main bataaya gaya he ki notification history naam kaa ek third party ap he jise google play store se downalo kiya ja saktaa he
 Through this, the messages can be read by recovering whatsapp notifications from the notification history settings
 is ap ko install karne ke baad mobile par aane vaale notification ke saath ek andvanced opshan milegaa
 You can read the content of notifications by tapping here
 agar bhejne vaale ne whatsap se massej delit bhi kar liya he phir bhi aap isamen wo massej pard paaenge
 However once the phone is restarted, then you will not be able to read the deleted messages of whatsapp
 isaki duusari seemaa ye he ki isamen zyada kairactors nahin pard paaenge, pehle 100 kairactor ke baad ke massej ricover nahin kar sakate
 whatsapp's Deleted Message feature has been given in Android and ios, but this trick of re-viewing deleted messages from notifications only applies to Android
 philhal whatsap kii taraf se koi statement nahin aayaa he
 It is possible that the company can fix it with upcoming updates
