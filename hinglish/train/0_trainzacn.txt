 bhartiya rigerv bankke purv governor raghuram rajan ne kaha he ki yues tregeri bharat ko 'karansi manupulator' kii shrenee main nahin rakh saktaa
 Rajan gave this instruction after the US Treasury statement in which he said that he was monitoring India's foreign policies
 iske liye usne dollar kii kharid badhanaa vajah bataai thi
 In an interview to CNBC, the US Treasury cannot do this, Rajan said, "I don't think the US Treasury can label a country as a 'currency manipulator' on half of an issue
" unhone kaha ki agar tregeri soch bhi rahi he, to bhi use aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 What happens is currency manipulation
 Currency manipulation is a monetary policy operation
 yah sthiti tab paidaa hoti he, jab koi sarkaar yaa kendriya bank apni gharelu mudra ke badale videshi mudra ko bade str par bechata kharidta he
 Often this work is done to influence the exchange rate and trade policies
 arabiai ne nahin di he koi pratikriyadrasal yues tregeri ne oktober main kaha tha ki vah bharat kii videsh nitiyon par kadi najar banaae hue he
 Then it was said that the Treasury could label India as a 'currency manipulator'
 arabiai kii taraf se haalanki isko lekar koi pratikriya nahin di gai he, lekin raghuram rajan ne jarur iskaa jawaab de diya he
 It seems based on three things that Labelghuram Rajan said that the US Treasury sees three things to declare a country as a 'currency manipulator'
 bharat in teenon shreniyon main kahin nahin he
 The categories by which the US Treasury calls a country a currency manipulator
 ye hai :- jab yues ke saath bylatural trade sarplus 20 arab dollar se zyada ho jaataa he
 - Current account surplus becomes 3% of the country's GDP
 - ek saal ke bheetar videshi mudra kii shuddh kharid arthvyavastha kii jidipi kaa 2 fisadi ho jaataa he
 Bharatarajan said that even though India's trade surplus with the US stood at $ 23 billion as of June, India did not fall into two categories
 lekin iske baavjood anya do shreniyon main bharat nahin aata he
 In such a situation, India cannot be called a 'currency manipulator'

 dilli-ensiaar main pradooshan kii kharaab sthiti ko dekhte hue kendriya paryaavaran mantri anil madhav dave ne dilli haryana punjab or uttar pradesh ke paryaavaran mantriyon kii baithak kii
 In the meeting, everyone blamed the Delhi government for the pollution of Delhi in one voice and said that 80 percent of the pollution is due to the Delhi government
 aarope-pratyarope kaa khel naa khele partiyankhaas taur par yah baithak paraali par bulaai gai thi yani burning crop
 Has the pollution of delhi-ncr deteriorated due to stubble? The environment ministers of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh gave their arguments on this
 unka kahana tha ki burning crop se sirf pradooshan kaa 20 fisadi hi prabhaav padataa he
 The remaining 80 per cent is due to Delhi itself
 ise dilli kaa vaataavaran dooshit hua he
 Therefore, the Delhi government should not accuse the rest of the states
 is vaataavaran ko thik karne ke liye karrwai kerani chahie
 After an advisory meeting the Center had given a mother-in-law earlier, Union Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave said that the Delhi government itself is responsible for 80 per cent pollution in Delhi
 unhone pichley ek saal main isko lekar adwijuri bhi di thi
 Despite this, the Delhi government did not do any work in this direction, due to which these conditions of the capital are there
 baaki rajyon ke mantriyon ne di ek raiudhar, punjab keparyaavaran mantritota singh ne bhi kaha ki dilli sarkaar kaa yah aarope bebuniyaad he ki paraali kii vajah se dilli main pradooshan failaa he
 Kejriwal is making allegations only for political reasons
 haryana ke paryaavaran mantri vipul goyal bhi maanate hai ki kejariwal ko aarope-pratyarope kii bajaae pradooshan kam karne ke liye miljul kar kaam karnaa chahie
 However, Delhi's Environment Minister Imran Hussain feels that pollution has increased in Delhi due to stubble and wind stoppage

 mahilaon ko kya mila?duusari taraf mahila diwas ke baavjood mahilaon kii suraksha par koi baat nahin kii, sisitivi par koi baat nahi kii
 Sharmishtha Mukherjee also lashed out at the Kejriwal government over the promises of wifi and women commandos
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki dilli cabinet main koi mantri mahila nahin he
 Ministers here exploit women
 ye chunavi bajet hecongress ne is bajet ko chunavi bajet bataaya he
 Sharmistha Mukherjee said - Municipal Corporation is not given their share amount and this time it has asked to give 15 percent

 bhagwaan krishna kii murat ko parade par sabase pehle yadi kisi ne is tarah jeevant banaaya to vah the nitish bharadwaj
 His character as Krishna became very popular in the Mahabharata
 nitish ne pehle us kirdaar ko nibhaane se inkaar kar diya tha, jisane unki jindagi badal di
 Every member of Nitish's family wanted Nitish to become a doctor
 lekin ve insaanon ke doctor na banakar jaanwaron ke doctor bananaa chaahate the, kyonki unhen ghode or sheron se bahut pyaar tha
 Nitish joined a race course as Assistant Veterinarian
 lekin kuch samay baad unhen ye job ubaau lagane laga
 He recalled his days when he used to act and direct in college play
 unhone bacchon ke theatre group little theatre main training bhi lee thi
 Nitish felt that he had learned more about himself after each play
 unhone tay kar liya ki ve taumr acting hi karenge
 However, Nitish's father was confused about his decision
 unka khyaal tha ki film industry main bina godfadar ke safal hona asambhav he
 Nevertheless, he fully supported Nitish
 mahabharat par film bana sakate hai shahrukh, kaha-dedh saal se pard rahaa hunnitish ne apane acting kareer kii shuruyaat marathi theatre se kii
 Later Ravi Baswani brought him to the Hindi theater
 iske baad nitish ne theatre group aankh join kar liya
 Apart from this, he also worked as an announcer and news reader in Bombay Doordarshan
 1987 main nitish ne marathi main pehali feechar film khatyaal saasuu nathaal san kii
 This was followed by Trishgani in Hindi and then he got the role which became his identity
 unhen mahabharat main biaar chopra ne krishna ke kirdaar ke liye sin kiya
 Actually, Nitish had previously auditioned for the role of Vidhur
 lekin baad main unase kaha gaya ki adhiktar episod main vidhur ko boodha dikhaaya janaa he, jabaki ve (nitish ) sirf 23 saal ke hai
 They are young
 iske baad nitish ko nakul or sahadev ke role ofer kiye gaye, lekin unhone karne se inkaar kar diya, kyonki unhen laga ki inamen kuch bhi karne laayak nahin he
 Sanjay Sinha is narrating the story of Mahabharata
 On the other hand, BR Chopra (producer), Ravi Chopra (director), Pandit Narendra Sharma (writer) and Rahi Masoom Raza did not agree on the name of the actor who played Krishna
 dansar, ravi chopra nitish ke saath pehle do aid shoot kar chuke the, isliye ve unhen ek actor ke taur par jaanate the
 Also known to him was Gufi Pental who played the role of Shakuni
 is tarah ravi chopra ne nitish ko krishna ke kirdaar ke liye audishan dene ko kaha, lekin unhone sidhaa inkaar kar diya
 The reason for this was that Nitish had read a lot about Krishna
 unki maa wilson cogel main sahitya vibhaag kii head thim
 He also built his own library at home
 isliye nitish ko krishna ke bare main jaanane kaa kaaphi mauka mila
 Now Nitish's dilemma was whether this production house would allow him to play Krishna in the way he knows about Krishna
 unki ek duusari chintaa yah bhi thi ki ve bahut kam umr or anubhav vaale kalakaar the
 So he took a big responsibility to play the character on which the entire serial has stood
 biaar chopra ne nitish se kaha tha, ‘tum is serial ke aadhaar stambh ho, yadi tum asafal hue to main asafal ho jaaoongaa’
 After this, Nitish performed this role so strongly that even after three decades, he remembers the character of Krishna played by him on hearing his name

 It is also identified with Jadhavpur University, where students come from not only West Bengal but also from Bihar and Orissa

 Political background Jadhavpur parliamentary seat came into existence before 1977 Lok Sabha elections
 yah seat sipiem kaa garh rahi lekin philhal ol india trinmul congress ne is par kabja kar liya he
 In the elections of 1977 and 1980, CPM strongman Somnath Chatterjee was elected as an MP from here

 Blast at Manchester Arena Blast at Manchester Arena
 bataa den ki manchester arina, europe main sabase badi concert kii jagah he
 It was opened in 1995
 isaki website ke anusaar isamen ek baar main 21,000 log aasaani se baith sakate hai
 It is quite a famous place
 concert or sports ke liye yah acha spes he
 Let us know that the concert was going on in Manchester city of Britain on Monday night
 police ke mutabik raat 10
 At 35, he received a blast call
 concert main shaamil hone ke liye 2 xxrep 4 0 ke kareeb log aae hue the
 Meanwhile, the sound of explosions was heard there
 jiske baad puure ilaake main koharaam much gaya
 The arena was evacuated immediately after the blast
 aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki blast arina kii tikat khidki ke paas hua
 According to sources, the cause of the blast is yet to be ascertained
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki sthaan par ek sandigdh upkaran rakhaa hua tha
 People are strongly opposing a flyover being set up in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka
 ve ise janata ke paison kii barbaadi maan rahe hai or unke mutabik isse shahar ke jam se koi raahat nahin milane vaali
 6
 72 kimi lambey or city centre ko hebbal fliover se jodgaye vaale 1,791 karod ru
 People are angry about this proposed steel construction
 vahiin prashasan kaa daawa he ki isse shahar ke bahari ilaake main sthit antarrashtriya airport tak jane vaale raste ko jam se mukti milegi
 On October 23, around 41,000 people signed an application seeking cancellation of the project
 iske ek haftaa pehle kareeb 10,000 logon ne maanav shrunkhlaa bana virodh jataayaa tha
 At the same time, around 42,000 people have opposed the project in a campaign from house to house and on Twitter
 isse logon ke mood kaa pataa chalata he
 Protesting the state Congress government, they are considering legal options, while a petition is already being heard in the Karnataka High Court
 yah project varshon se dhul chaat rahaa he
 Bengaluru Development Minister K
 je
 George resumed the project shortly after his appointment last month after receiving a clean chit in a suicide case
 sarkaar fliover ko do saal main puraa karnaa chaahati he, jabaki isaki laagat or paryaavaran ke nuksaan par sawaal uth rahe hai
 812 trees have to be cut for its construction
 iske alaava rishwat ke aarope bhi lag rahe hai
 Bengaluru has more than 50 flyovers and underpasses
 inamen se zyaadaatar kuch varshon main apni upyogita kho chuke hai
 The city is jammed every day at the Yashwantpur, Silk Board and Richmond Circle flyovers and underpasses near the Indian Institute of Science
 virodhiyon ke mutabik, aise project se jam ek jagah se hatakar duusari jagah shift ho jaataa he
 Traffic Engineering Consultant M
 en
 "the rapid increase in number of vehicles in Bangalore has made flyovers and underpasses redundant," says Srihari
 har bade fliover par uski simit kshamta ke kaaran jam aam ho gaya he
 We need to find far-reaching sustainable measures to reduce the number of vehicles
 "rojaanaa kareeb 1,60,000 vaahan prastaavit fliover ke raste par aadaa-tirachha guzarate hai
 "the flyover can be effective for the next 3-4 years, but it will also become useless when the number of vehicles increases," says Srihari
 jam yahaan se hatakar hebbal fliover par shift ho jayega
 The government will have to arrange for faster public transport service so that people leave private vehicles and are motivated to use it
 "bangaluru main rojaanaa kareeb 3,000 nae vaahanon kaa registration hota he
 The city already has more than six million vehicles, of which 34 lakh are two-wheelers
 dilli ke baad desh main yah sabase adhik sankhya he
 But there is relief from the metro rail project
 har roj 30,000 se zyada log vijaynagar or old madras road ke bich iskaa istemaal karte hai
 This is reducing the burden of congestion on the roads
 kraliover project ke virodh kii aguai kar rahe rangakarmi prakaash belawadi kehete hai ki ise banane main itani ''hadabadi" kyon dikhaai ja rahi he? ve poochhate hai, ''sarkaar itnaa bada project shuru karne se pehle sambandhit logon kii raay kyon nahin le sakati? hariyaali or paardarshita kii keemat chukaa rahe bangaluru ko fliover kii jarurat nahin he
 We are not going to stop, we will also take legal action against it
 "is fliover ke nirmaan par prati kimi 267 karod ru
 The cost is estimated
 yah chaunkaane vaali baat he kyonki airport tak alivated metro line banane par prati kimi 385 karod ru
 The cost is estimated and this will enable about 25,000 passengers to travel in an hour
 mono rail ke nirmaan par prati kimi 140 karod ru
 The cost is estimated and it will be able to travel 15,000 people per hour
 sarkaar fliover ko bijepi kaa idia bataa pallaa jhaadeye kii koshish kar rahi he
 This project was conceived in 2010 under BJP rule
 sarkaar kahati he ki is saal june main jab logon kii raay maangi gai thi to 299 pratikriyaaon main se kareeb teen-chauthai logon ne is project ke paksh main raay di thi
 Chief Minister Siddaramaiah says, "bangalore is a growing city
 yahaan buniyadi dhaanche se sambandhit har tarah ke project kii jarurat he
 It has been examined at all levels and consent of experts has been obtained
 ab peeche hatane kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 "A major reason for the project being questioned is the increase in its cost (rs 441 crore on the project)
 ) he
 At a public meeting in Bangalore on October 23, historian and writer Ramchandra Guha asked, "why is the Congress showing such momentum on this project when the next elections are coming closer?" Why is there so much panic in the matter only after the return of a controversial minister in the cabinet? Some people believe that they are raising money for elections
 yah sahi nahin he
 Actually they know that they will lose
 so ve jaldi se jaldi paisa jamaa karnaa chaahate hai
 "siddaramaiah says that the cost has increased significantly in the last two years due to increase in VAT on steel, among other things
 is project kaa kaam dekh rahaa bangaluru vikaas praadhikaran achal sampatti kii nilaamee se fund badaae kii ummid kar rahaa he
 Ultimately, the government will have to come to the center for help
 fliover ke khilaaf yah baat bhi jaati he ki vaahan maalikon ko chungi bhi deni pad sakati he
 However, Minister George says that no final decision has been taken on this
 guha is project or siddharamaiya kii khulkar aalochana karte hai, ''ve vishesh hit rakhane vaale mantriyon ke kaidi ban gaye hai
 What legacy are they leaving behind? Political corruption is ruining society

 Indian Space Agency (ISRO) Chandrayaan-2 (chandrayaan-2) continuously made new revelations about the moon
 Used to be
 chandrayan-2 kaa vikram lander bhale hi sahi landing na kar paaya ho lekin chand ke chaaron taraf chakkar laga rahaa uskaa orbitor ab bhi har roj nai or chaunkaane vaali tasviren saamne laa rahaa he
 On 22 October, ISRO has released two similar pictures
 ye pehali baar he jab isro ne chand kii aisi rangeen tasviren aam logon ke liye jari kii hai
 In these pictures, it is being discovered that there are black spots on the surface of the moon
 Why are there so many craters on its surface? # ISRO # Chandrayaan2's DF-SAR is designed to produce greater details about the morphology and ejecta materials of impact craters on the lunar surface

 com / sehukoyjmv — ISRO (@isro) October 22, 2019 This was revealed by Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DF-SAR) in Chandrayaan-2 orbiter
 is upkaran ne chand ke dakshini dhruv par maujuud sataha kaa adhyayan kiya he
 With this tool you can find out where the pits are
 Where are the mountains? Where is the flat land? And where are the stones? The specialty of this device is that it can easily make a picture of any object at least 2 meters above the lunar surface
 iske liye is upkaran se do prakaar kii kirane nikalati hai
 By collating the data of those rays hitting the surface and returning to them to find out what is on the lunar surface? Chandrayaan-1: When ISRO made 'landing' at the moon's south pole 10 years ago Find out why there are dark spots on the face of the moon? Photographs sent to the ISRO centers of Earth from DF-SAR show that these devices are capable of providing information above and below the surface of the moon
 saath hi DF-SAR yah bhi bataa saktaa he ki chand kii sataha par koun sa gaddha kab bana he? aakhir chand kii sataha par bane gaddhon se chand ke kaale dhabbon kaa kya lenaa-dena he? asal main yahi gadde or unki parachhaaiyaan hi chand ke chehre par kaale dhabbe se dikhaai padate hai
 a picture of the pitiscus-t crater near the moon's south pole is clearly visible in it
 (photoh isro)kaise banate hai chand kii sataha par ye gadde?chand kii sataha par aksar darjanon yaa usase zyada kii sankhya main ulkapind, kshudra grah or dhoomaketu takaraate rahete hai
 Due to their collision, such pits are being formed on the surface of the moon for thousands of years
 DF-SAR yah bhi bataa saktaa he ki chand kii sataha par koun sa gaddha kab bana he? jaise pehali tasviir main agar aap dhyaan se dekhen to aapakon pataa chalegaa ki koun sa gaddha nayaa he or koun sa purana he?karvaa chouth par isro kaa tohfa, chandrayan-2 ke IIRS ne bheji chand kii sataha kii tasviir1
 Identification of new pit The color of the pit is more bright and yellow
 uske chaaron taraf taaji mitti or dhul dikhaai de rahi he
 The color inside these pits is brighter and lighter than the lunar surface

 Old crater dark color The craters whose color is darker on the surface of Kachand
 yani kaala, nila or gaharaa haraa he vah purana gaddha he

 isse ek din pehle hi party netaishvanth sinhane kaha tha ki modi sabase lokapriy netaa hai or unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya janaa chahie
 Ram Jethmalani supported Yashwant Sinha's statement that Modi is most qualified for the post of PM
 jethmalani modi kii tarif karte hue unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki modi 100 fisadi dharmanirpeksh hai
 He said, 'secular and communal terms have been misused in politics
 'ram jethmalani ne yah saaf kiya ki loktantr main sabko apni raay rakhane kaa haq he
 However, she refrained from saying anything in the name of her own party's senior leader Sushma Swaraj
 ram jethmalani ne kaha, 'philhal desh kaa mood narendra modi ke paksh main he
 If the BJP projects them, it will benefit the party in the elections
 ' ram jethmalani ke is bayaan ko purv swasthya mantri or bijepi netaa seepi thakur kaa samarthan mila he

 And accused himself of his father
 diaiji se lekar tamaam bade afasaron se nyaay kii guhaar tak lagaai
 When the crime branch started investigating, the complaining girl got herself caught in her woven net
 darasal, shikaayat par police ne pita or do videographer ko giraftaar kar liya
 But when they checked the laptop they found nothing was found
 jisase police ko shaq ho gaya
 Then when the girl was interrogated in the typical police style she revealed all the truth
 usne kabool kiya ki usne jaanboojhkar sinchai vibhaag main tainaat apane pita ko fansaaya
 The woman in-charge of the police station said that the father had given a car to his daughter when the marriage was finalized, while the in-laws and husband were constantly pressuring them to name the car
 tang aakar ladki ne apane pita par sangeen aarope laga die
 During interrogation, it was revealed that at first the girl's housemates were not ready for the love marriage but due to pressure from the boy and the daughter, he bowed down and both were married
 is dauraan unhone beti ke naam par car ke saath baari bharkam dahej dene kii bhi taiyaari kar lee
 Despite this, the girl ran away from home ten days before marriage and married the same person with whom the father had decided to marry
 jharkhand ke ek maovadi netaa ne dhamkee di he ki naksaliyon ke khilaaf hamale kiye jane kii surat main unka sanghathan littey kii tarah congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh par hamale kar saktaa he

 itnaa hi nahin inhone us premi se ek yphone bhi isi farji tareeke se thaga
 This is not the only case of fraud on Facebook
 is tarah ke kai maamle saamne aate rahete hai
 Angry minds heavily abuse this social site
 pakistani suraksha agency kahati he ki wo duniya kii sabase shaatir agenciyon main se ek he
 One who not only sees enemies but also sniffs
 magar itani shaatir hone ke baad bhi pakistani agenciyaan ye fark nahin kar pai ki hamid aashiq he yaa jasoos
 Spies are those who enter the house as sons-in-law, even if they do not let them get hooked
 ye kahani he ek aise hi hindustani jaanbaaj kii
 Which was a spy who crossed the border and not just stepped on Pakistani territory
 balki unki sena main unka adhikari ban kar bharat kii madad karata rahaa
 This is the story of the real tiger
 jisaki jasusi ne 20 hazaar bhartiya sainikon ko shahid hone se bachaaya tha
 The Tiger we are talking about, whether he has any connection with the film 'tiger' or not
 magar duniya main jab jab diler jasuson kii baat hogi
 Then the face of this person will be revealed
 kyonki filmi jasoos bane salmaan khan reel life ke tiger to ho sakate hai
 But if there was any real tiger in the history of India
 to wo ye shaks he
 Which is still alive in people's minds
 bhartiya khufia agency indian research and enelysis wing yani ro ne use khitaab diya tha 'tiger'
 The tiger who was the lion of India
 wo tiger jisane akele hi puure pakistan ko hilaa diya tha
 The Tiger which was the heritage of India, then another name for awe for Pakistan
 wo tiger jisane hansate-hansate apni javaniapani dharti maa ke liye jhonk di
 The tiger who sacrificed his life on his homeland India one day
 magar usee hindustan ne use bhula diya
 In the year 1952 Sriganganagar, Rajasthan grew up in the streets of India, the real tiger of India
 uskaa naam tha ravindra kowshik
 The young man who was going to save the destiny of India
 ravindra kowshik ke bare main kaha jaataa heki hindustan ke itihaas main usase bada jasoos naa koi hua he or naa hi kabhi hoga
 Even the biggest detectives of the country consider Ravindra as their guru
 pakistan kii jail main jasusi ke aarope main sajaa kaat kar aae rupalal bhi ravindra ko apana ustad maanate the
 The story of Ravindra Kaushik aka Tiger is full of dangers, the story of his arrival in the world of espionage is equally interesting
 darasal ravindra kowshik ko bachapan se hi acting karne kaa shauk tha
 You can find this hobby of Ravindra Kaushik by looking at his pictures
 har tasviir main ek alag andaaj
 Somewhere Ravindra Kaushik is standing as Jesus, and somewhere like a rich person who presses cigarettes in his mouth
 or yaheen shauk unke liye jasusi kii duniya kaa pehla kadam ban gaya
 In 1972, Ravindra Kaushik participated in a youth festival in Lucknow
 is festival ke ek naatak main ravindra ek bhartiya jasoos kaa role nibhaa rahe the
 Who gets trapped in China and then suffers torture
 kehete hai ki ravindra kowshik kii acting dekhakar sena ke kuch adhikari itane prabhavit hue ki unhen military intelligence kaa hissaa bana liya
 And Ravindra was already sent as a mission to the country which was the biggest enemy of India at that time i
e
 Pakistan
 mana jaataa he ki ravindra kowshik ko pakistan main ek resident agent ke taur par bheja gaya tha
 Kaushik's job was to get a clue of Pakistani intrigue against India
 kehete hai ravindra kowshik kaa pehla mishan behad kaamyaab rahaa jiske baad 1975 main use ek aurbade mishan ke liye bheja gaya
 And this time Ravindra was given a new name for the mission
 wo naam jo aage chalakar pakistan main unki sabasebadi pahchaan banane vaala tha or wo naam tha nabi ahamed shakir
 After entering Pakistan, Nabi Ahmed Shakir i
e
 Ravindra Kaushik slowly started making his inroads
 apane rahane ke liye thikaana chunaa lahore ko
 The mission was very large, so Ravindra Kaushik also enrolled in a large college in Lahore to avoid the public eye
 kehete hai ki college main daakhila milte hi uske aadhaar par jaali dastauez banawaye or usee college se elelbi kii degree bhi hasil kii
 An Indian was not only hiding his identity in Pakistan but was also acquiring an academic degree there
 zaahir he ek hindustani ke liye pakistan main ye kaam katai aasaan nahin tha
 Still, like a vicious detective, Ravindra Kaushik was going step by step with full agility
 lekin ravindra kaa asli makasad abhi baaki tha
 Creating an identity and obtaining a degree in Lahore was just one way
 kyonki hindustan ke is tiger kaa asli mishan to ab shuru hone vaala tha or ye mishan tha pakistani fouj kaa hissaa bananaa
 Ravindra Kaushik had established his new identity in Pakistan by becoming Nabi Ahmed
 puure pakistan main koi nahin jaanata tha ki wo ek jasoos hai
 But this was the beginning, Ravindra Kaushik was now going to show the feat which later became an immortal tale in the world of espionage
 isiilie unhe naam diya gaya tiger
 Now everyone in Pakistan was known as Ravindra Kaushik by the name of Nabi Ahmed
 ravindra kowshik kisi chalaave kii tarah pakistani sena main daakhil hone ke liye jaal par jaal bunate ja rahe the
 Then recruitment started in the Pakistani Army
 farzi pahchaan or college kii degree tiger ke kaam aa gai
 Ravindra Kaushik acquired an officer's rank in the Pakistani Army through his LLB degree
 or is tarah hindustani jasoos ravindra kowshik pakistani fouj kaa adhikari nabi ahamed ban gaya or yaheen se shuru hua tiger kaa asli mishan
 Because Tiger's entry into the army was going to be a means to find out the secrets of the Pakistani army
 hameshaa kii tarah pakistan main us vakt bhi fouj kaaphi taqatvar thi or suraksha se lekar raajnneeti tak
 There was an intrusion of army everywhere
 isiilie ravindra ke liye jaankariyaan jutanaa aasaan bhi tha or mushkil bhi
 Ravindra, who became Nabi Ahmed during his service in the Pakistani army, began to make inroads in military circles
 kisi ko un par shaq naa ho iske liye ravindra ne vahiin shaadi bhi kar lee
 It is believed that Ravindra Kaushik married the daughter of a top officer of the Pakistani army and with this, Ravindra Kaushik has erased every reason to suspect him in the eyes of the Pakistani army
 1971 ke daur main bharat-paak ke rishte behad kharaab tha
 With the 1971 defeat, the Baukhalai Pak Army was continuously plotting to get revenge from India
 aise main ravindra kowshik kii shakl main pakistani sena main ek hindustani kaa hona ek bahut badi takat tha
 Here Pakistan was plotting, on the other hand, Tiger was sending news of each moment to India
 is baat kaa zikr khudaibi ke purv joint diarector em
 K
 dhar ne kowshik par likhi apni kitaab mishan tu pakistan main kiya he
 M
 ke
 According to Dhar, Ravindra Kaushik was a heritage for us
 kowshik pakistan main bhartiya intelligence kii dhuree ban gaye the
 It was only due to Ravindra Kaushik that 20 thousand Indian soldiers were saved
 or kai baar aise maukey aae jab kowshik ne bharat ke liye kai ahmajankariyaan bhejin
 And perhaps this is the reason why the then Home Minister of the country gave the title of Tiger to Ravindra Kaushik
 aise khulaa tiger kaa razeb tak pakistan main ravindra kowshik ek manze hue jasoos kii tarah kaam kar rahe the
 And there was a stir in the Pakistani army
 kisi ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki aakhir pakistani sena ke sikret plan li kaise ho jate hai
 Nobody suspected Tiger Ravindra but the mistake of a Hindustani partner of his own revealed the truth of Ravindra Kaushik alias Nabi Ahmed
 kowshik ke bare main likhi gai khabaron ke mutabik saal 1983 main inayat messiah naam kaa ek or jasoos pakistan bheja gaya
 Who was sent to help Ravindra Kaushik
 lekin is dauraan messiah kii ek galat harakat kii vajah se pakistan fouj ko pataa chal gaya ki kowshik hi bhartiya agent hai
 On knowing the reality of Ravindra Kaushik, the Pakistani army rulers lost their senses
 unhen yakeen hi nahin hua ki koi bhartiya jasoos unki fouj main itane lambey vakt se kaam kar rahaa tha auki unke har plan kii jaankaree bharat bhej rahaa tha
 The Pakistani army arrested Nabi Ahmad alias Ravindra Kaushik as soon as he came to know of the reality
 phir lagaataar kowshik ko torchar kiya gaya
 It is said that during this time, Kaushik was kept in the Sialkot Center of the Pakistani Army and an attempt was made to unseat him
 lekin jaisaa naam tha vaisaa hi kuch is bahadur kaa jajba tha
 This Tiger of Hindustan tolerated every oppression of Pakistanis
 third degree torchar ko jhelane ke baavjood kowshik ne munh nahin kholaa
 In 1985, when the Pakistani army did not get any information from Ravindra Kaushik at the Sialkot Center, he was sent to Mianwalaan jail
 or tab se lekar apni maut tak ravindra kowshik miyanvaalan jail main hi rahe
 According to Ravindra Kaushik's late brother, Ravindra brought the news not only to him but also to the rest of the Indians in Pakistani jail
 pakistaniyon ke julm or sitam ravindra kowshik kii himmat to nahin tod paae lekin unki sehat dhire dhire kharaab hone lagi
 Ravindra Kaushik died of heart disease and tuberculosis while imprisoned in prison, which led to his death in 2001

 n Srinivasan is not ready to leave the pitch to re-sit on the cricket boss chair in India
 unhone agle do hafte ke andar chennai super kings main apni hissedari bechney kaa faisla kar liya he, taaki vah bisisiai adhyaksh ke pad ke liye chunaav lard saken
 According to sources, he has made contact with his close friends in the Board of Control for Cricket in India and informed them about his decision
 saath hi unke saamne shrinivasana ne phir doharaaya ki unhone kuch bhi galat nahin kiya he
 Within two weeks, he will sell his stake in Chennai Super Kings and give an affidavit to the court that there is nothing like conflict of interest in the way of contesting his election
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court ne spot-fixing maamle par faisalaa sunaaya or kaha ki shrinivasana yaa ipel team ko chun sakate hai yaa board ke adhyaksh pad ko
 6 in February 2008 by the court board

 The 4 rules were also misunderstood in the eyes of the law, through which cricket administrators were allowed to do professional work by purchasing teams in IPL and Champions League
 isi niyam main badlaav ke baad shrinivasana bhi team ke maalik bane the
 The court had clearly said that Srinivasan's team boss is the root of all the controversy
 apane faisle main supreme court ne saaf kar diya tha ki shrinivasana sahit koi bhi shaks jiskaa vyavaasayik hit ho, wo bisisiai main kisi pad ke liye ayogy hoga or ye ayogyata tab tak prabhavi hogi
 As long as such person has commercial interests
 saath hi supreme court ne apane faisale main board ko chah saptaah ke andar chunaav karaane ko kaha he
 Now Srinivasan has only one option to return to the board, leaving CSK, and Srinivasan is exploring this possibility

 It is very important to give space to each other to better fulfill any relationship but sometimes people make mistakes
 pyaar main hone ke baavjood bhi aapako apanepartnerko paryaapt spes deni chahie
 Personal space should not be misused
 partner ko spes dene kaa matlab yah bilkul nahin he ki vah aapse bor ho gaya he yaa phir aapako dhokhaa de rahaa he
 Even in relationship, two people share their every thing, every experience, but still it is very important to take care of each other's personal space
 chaliye jaanate hai kaise aap apane partner ko spes dene kii aadat daal sakate hai
 Always look positively - separating for a short time and doing your work in complete isolation is good not only for your partner but also for you
 isse aapaki nijee jindagi or ek kapal kii jindagi donon main hi santulan banataa he
 You can live every aspect of your life
 ise apni kami ke taur par naa len-kai logon ko lagata he ki agar partner apane liye spes kii maang kar rahaa he to vah relationships main khush nahin he yaa phir ve isrishteko khatm karnaa chaahate hai lekin ye sach nahin he
 Giving personal space also removes the feeling of insecurity inside you
 aap kya mahasoos karte hai, unhen bataaen-agar partner ko personal spes dene ke vichaar se hi aapako tension hone lagati he to apane partner se ye baat jarur share karen
 Together you can find a middle ground
 dhyaan rahen duusare shaks ko yah mahasoos nahin hona chahie ki aap use khud se dur jane par majaboor kar rahe hai

 While Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram believes that cricket should be kept away from politics, former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has a different perspective
 rawalpindi express ke naam se mashhoor shoeb kaa maananaa he ki seemaa par ashaanti or tanaav ke bich bharat-paak cricket sambhav nahin he
 It is worth mentioning that India has to play a bilateral series in the UAE from Pakistan in December as per the pre-determined schedule
 isamen teen test, paanch vanade or do tii20 match honge
 But Shoaib Akhtar says that it seems impossible to have any such series due to the ongoing tension on the border regarding terrorist activities in recent times
 akhtar ko is par koi aashcharya nahin hua jab unhen pataa chalaa ki bijepi saansad or bisisiai sachiv anuraag thakur ne raajnneetik tanaav ke maahaul main bharat-paak siries hone par ashanka jataai he
 Akhtar said, 'everyone knows that politics should be kept separate from sports, but unfortunately there is a lot of tension on the border and this is not the right time to play between the two countries
 ' 40-year-old Akhtar is often seen on Indian television these days
 ve mahasoos karte hai ki cricket tanaav ke bich nahin ho saktaa
 He said, "however, whenever there is less tension and india-pakistan will be ready for talks at the top level, then cricket will be a great way to improve the relationship
 'tippaniyan Akhtar said, "these two are the two best teams in the world and if one wants to keep cricket entertaining, one cannot ignore either of them
" aap is baat ko andekha nahin kar sakate ki in donon deshon se kai anany pratibhaaen saamne ai hai or iske saath hi donon deshon ke log unhen ek-duusare ke khilaaf khelte hue dekhnaa pasand karte hai
 ' isisi president or pakistan ke purv test captain jahir abbaas ne haal hi main kaha tha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich dwipaksheeya siries tabhi sambhav hogi, jab sarkarein aisa karne ke liye taiyaar hongi
 In such a situation, Akhtar seems more close to reality
 gauratlab he ki purv nirdhaarit kaarykram ke anusaar bharat ko pakistan se yuai main disambar main dwipaksheeya siries khelnaa he
 It will consist of three Tests, five odis and two T20 matches
 lekin shoeb akhtar kaa kahana he ki haal ke dinon main aatanki gatividhiyon ko lekar seemaa par jari tanaav se aisi koi siries hona asambhav dikh rahaa he
 Akhtar was not surprised when he came to know that BJP MP and BCCI Secretary Anurag Thakur feared an indo-pak series in an atmosphere of political tension
 akhtar ne kaha, 'sabhi ko pataa he ki raajnneeti ko khelon se alag rakhana chahie, lekin durbhaagya se seemaa par kaaphi tanaav he or is samay donon deshon ke bich khilne kaa sahi samay nahin he
 ' 40 saal ke akhtar in dinon aksar bhartiya televijan par dikhte rahete hai
 They feel that cricket cannot be under stress
 unhone kaha, 'haalanki jab bhi tanaav kam hoga or bharat-pakistan sheersh str par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar honge, tab cricket rishte sudhaarney kaa shandaar tarika hoga
 Comments akhtar ne kaha, 'yah donon vishwa kii do sabase behatar timen hai or yadi koi cricket ko manoranjak banaae rakhana chahta he, to in donon main se kisi ko bhi nazarandaaj nahin kar saktaa
 You cannot ignore that many unique talents have come out from these two countries and with this people of both countries like to see them playing against each other
 ' ICC President and former Pakistan Test captain Zaheer Abbas recently said that a bilateral series between India and Pakistan will be possible only when the governments are ready to do so

 The ICC turned down the request of the Board of Control for Cricket in India to appeal against the judicial commissioner's decision not to convict James Anderson, saying he was satisfied with the way the decision was taken

 bank kii yojana he ki is atm ko aage chalakar itnaa apgrade kar diya jaae ki iske jariye nausainik apane rupee kaa kisi duusare acount main transfar or kisi bhi card main pament bhi kar sake
 The Navy has entered into an agreement with SBI for this

 These letters are not sent to any person but to the enumerative Lord Ganesha
 ji haa, rajasthan ke ranthambhore main ek mandir aisa he jahaan ganpati ko har shubh kaam se pehle chitthee bhejkar nimantran diya jaataa he
 Therefore, there is always a pile of letters and invitation cards at the feet of God
 mandir kii sthapana:rajasthan ke savai madhaupur se lagbhag 10 kimi
 The Banaganesh temple in Ranthambore fort is known for sending letters to the Lord
 yahaan ke log ghar main koi bhi mangal kaary karte hai to ranthambhore vaale ganesh ji ke naam card bhejnaa nahin bhoolatey
 This temple was built in the 10th century by King Hamir of Ranthambore
 kaha jaataa he ki yuddh ke dauraan raja ke sapane main ganesh ji aae the or unhen aashirwad diya
 After which the king won the battle
 tab unhone apane kile main mandir kaa banwaaya
 Lord Ganesha sits on Trinetri: The idol of Lord Ganesha here is somewhat different from the rest of the temples
 murti main bhagwaan kii teen ankhen hai
 Ganesha is seated with his wife Riddhi, Siddhi and his son Shubh-benefit
 gananaayak kaa vaahan chuha bhi saath main he
 Here Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated with pomp and special puja is performed
 dak se bhagwaan ko bheji jaati hai chitthiyaan:yah desh ke kuch un mandiron main se he jahaan bhagwaan ke naam dak aati he
 Many people of the country send the first card of every Mangal work done in their house to Lord Ganesha here
 card par pataa likhaa jaataa he-'shri ganesh ji, ranthambhore kaa kila, jila- savai madhaupur (rajasthan)'
 The postman also sends these letters to the temple with full reverence and respect
 iske baad pujari chitthiyon ko bhagwaan ganesh ke saamne padhakar unke charnon main rakh dete hai
 It is believed that sending an invitation to Lord Ganesha in this temple completes all the tasks

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhartiya janata party ke gathbandhan vaali endie prachand bahumat se jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab hui he
 The NDA won a total of 348 seats
 maharashtra main bhi endie kaa jaadu votaron ke sir chadhakar bolaa
 The bjp-shiv Sena alliance is close to winning 40 seats
 is seat par upie ke khate main 7 siten or anya partiyon ke khate main 1 siten jaati dikh rahi hai
 In such a situation, along with the Modi wave, the hard work of Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis cannot be denied
 maharashtra main endie ko mili itani badi jeet jaahir taur par bhartiya janata party main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kaa kad badhayegi
 Devendra Fadnavis has emerged as the tallest BJP leader in Maharashtra
 unhone shivasena ke saath hue gathbandhan main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In Maharashtra, the assembly elections were held a few days after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in which BJP won 122 seats while Shiv Sena won 63 seats
 chunaav jeetne ke baad pradesh adhyaksh rahe devendra fadanvis ko bijepi ne rajya kaa mukhyamantri banaaya tha
 At that time Fadnavis was one of the youngest Chief Ministers of the BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye aaj tak-exis maai india ke nattejey maharashtra main bhi sach sabit hue hai
 In the exit poll, BJP emerged as the largest party in Maharashtra
 aaj tak-exis maai india ke agsit pole main maharashtra main NDA ko 38 se 42 siten di thim jo asli nateezon jitna hi he
 While the UPA was projected to get 6 to 10 seats, in reality the result was similar
 pichley baar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 23 siten mili thim vahiin sahyogi shivasena ko 18 siten mili thim
 The exit poll had predicted that BJP would get 48 percent vote share, Congress 33 percent, VBA 13 percent and others six percent vote share in the party wise vote share
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bijepi gathbandhan ko 48 pratishat vot share mila tha, vahiin vidhansabha chunaav main 47 pratishat vot share mila tha
 While the Congress got 37 and 36 percent vote shares in the 2014 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections respectively
 anya ko 2014 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main 15 or 17 pratishat vot share mili the
 On January 23, 2018, the BJP and Shiv Sena lost their nearly 25-year-old friendship with Shiv Sena and party president Uddhav Thackeray announced to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections alone
 us vakt shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne media ke saamne kaha tha ki main vachan detaa hum ki ham apane dam par desh ke sabhi rajyon main chunaav ladenge chaahe jeeten yaa haare lekin chunaav apane dam par hi ladenge
 At that time, Shiv Sena had also claimed that it would win 25 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 150 seats in the assembly elections
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bijepi or shivasena main kuch faislon or maharashtra main varchasv ko lekar matbhed shuru ho gaye
 From the farmers' issue to the water problem, the Shiv Sena, the ally in the government, raised questions and blamed Fadnavis for it
 lekin fadanvis ne bahut aasaani se shivasena ko apane paale main kar liya
 This major victory for the NDA in Maharashtra is going to increase their stature in the eyes of the party high command
 2014 ke kya the aankade2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ko 41 siten milin thim
 On the other hand, if we compare it with the assembly elections held in the state, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance would have got 37 seats in the Lok Sabha
 isi tarah congress or sahyogiyon ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main chah siten milin thim, jabaki vidhansabha chunaav se tulana karne par in siton kii sankhya 10 pahunchati

 aaj karj se karaah rahe europea desh greece kii haalat bhi kuch waisi hi he
 This great country, which gave the world the best sporting tradition with the Olympics, is badly entangled in the debt trap
 karj ke pehle kaa kathanak ?greece kii bhoomi sucraat, pluto or arestu jaise mahaan darshanico kii karm-bhoomi rahi he

 Speaking of modern times, Greece's GDP growth in the 90s was far ahead of the world average
 jab puraa europe 'european union' ke bhavishya ko lekar sashankit tha tab greece ne 1981 main uskaa daaman thamkar puri duniya ko yah sandesh diya tha ki europe raktranjit itihaas se aage nikal kar saath-saath bhi bad saktaa he
 But after the global recession in 2008-09, Greece's story began to be written in debt
 karj kaa daldal or vibhishak hota chalaa gaya
 How big is Greece's debt? The entire economy of Greece is worth $ 238 billion (nominal)
 or greece par karj boj 425 arab dollar se bhi zyada kaa he
 This means Greece has debt of more than 160 percent of GDP

 Greece's Impact on India? In the era of globalization, Greece's economy is not directly connected to India

 input- bhashaa Referring to the FIR lodged against the 'tribune', he said that on the grounds that negative thoughts would have negative consequences, it would be better for people to have constructive views about it
 yuidiai ke purv adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘agar aap sirf nakaaratmak vichaar rakhte hai or rachanaatmak vichaar nahin, to uske anya parinaam (nakaaratmak) hi honge
 i think everyone should assume that Aadhaar will remain here

 hindi jagat kaa sabase bada mahamanch Sensational incidents of honor killing have come to light in the Punjab province of Pakistan
 yahaan juthi shaan kii khatir 19 varshiya ek ladki kii uske sautele bhai ne kulhadi se katkar hatya kar di
 On receipt of the information, the police reached the spot and took the body and sent it for postmortem
 esechao rana taahir ke mutabik, yah ghatana ravivaar ko sahivaal jile ke krashchiyan vaala main hui, jo lahore se 230 kilometre dur sthit he
 Accused Irfan suspected that his half-sister Saira was in love with a man living in the same area
 unhone bataaya ki irfan ne ravivaar ko syra par us samay kulhadi se hamalaa kiya jab vah so rahi thi
 She was seriously injured in the attack
 use sahivaal ke jila mukhyalay aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan uski maut ho gai
 No family member reported the matter to the police
 padosiyon ne police ko soochna di
 Police stopped when the family was returning to the village carrying Saira's body in an ambulance
 police ko dekhakar irfan ambulance se faraar ho gaya, shav ko aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Police said family members are not considering it a murder
 unka kahana he ki syra ne parivaar ke sammaan ko thes pahunchaai thi
 Let us tell you that there have been frequent cases of honor killing in Pakistan

 Hussain was arrested by the police on suspicion
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv arun jetali ne kaha ki agali sarkaar banane ko lekar galatfahami ke shikaar upie main 'grihayuddh' chhidaa hua he
 The fact is that a coalition government that failed completely on internal security and economy fronts will not even get close to forming a government, and after the election the Congress will remain a third-tier force
 buudhvaar ko bhaajapa karyaalay main samvaadadaataaon ne baatcheet karte hue jetali ne kaha congress kaa upie ke ghatak vamadalon, sapa, rajd va ensipi ke saath alag-alag 'yuddh' chal rahaa he

 jetali ne kaha vastav main sarkaar main shaamil hone yaa na hone kii naubat hi nahin aayegi kyonki chunaav nattejey upie va congress ko behad kamjor sabit kar denge
 BJP General Secretary said that Congress has kept the election campaign a 'family drama' so that national questions like internal security and shabby economy cannot be debated
 unhone kaha kamjor pradhanmantri da
 Due to the indecisive working style of Manmohan Singh, 170 districts of the country are in the grip of Naxalism and Maoism, but the Congress does not want an electoral debate on these questions
 jetali ne kaha vastav main congress ke paas apana koi chunavi agenda nahin he
 She is only reacting to the bjp's issues

 grih mantri or bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah kaa maananaa he ki sansad main teen talaak sambandhi vidheyak paarit hone se yah saaf ho gaya he ki mukhya vipakshi dal congress main ab 'vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii kshamta' nahin bachi he
 Describing the passage of the bill in Parliament in many ways, Shah said that the attitude of the Congress which was thirty years ago at the time of Shahbano episode has been seen in Parliament this time too
 shah ne shanivaar ko kuch akhabaaron main prakashit apane lekh main tippanee kii he ki teen talaak sambandhi vidheyak paarit hone ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam itihaas main raja ram mohan raay or ishwarchandra vidyasagar jaise 'samaaj sudhaarkon' kii shrenee main rakhaa jayega
 The Home Minister has said in his article that 30 July is a major break in India's parliamentary history
 unhone kaha, 'raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad teen talaak kanoon prabhaav main aa gaya he or muslim mahilaon ko is kupratha ke dansh se sarankshan milegaa
 He said that this showed the commitment of the Modi government towards the honor, self-respect and dignified life of women
 grih mantri ne lekh main daawa kiya, 'ek tathy yah bhi ubhar kar saamne aayaa he ki vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne kii congress kii kshamta ksheen hui he
 The article stated that the triple talaq law was a matter of public concern and social reform, so many non-nda parties also indirectly or indirectly supported the passage of this bill
 shah ke anusaar, 'aaj se teen dashak purv ekbar yah avasar aayaa tha jab shahbaano maamle main 400 se adhik saansadon vaali congress party muslim mahilaon ko is dansh se mukt kara sakati thi
 But under pressure from Muslim Personal Law Board, clerics and vote bank politics, (then) Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took the decision contrary to the court's order
 bijepi adhyaksh ne lekh main kaha he ki aaj ke tees saal pehle congress kaa jo rukh tha vahi vot bank kii raajnneeti kaa rukh is baar bhi sansad main hui charchaa or voting main dekhne ko mila he jo 'uski tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kaa charitra darshata he
 The Home Minister said that the bill exposed the alleged liberals as well
 lekh main unhone kaha he ki mahila adhikaron ke liye aae din andolan karne vaale udaaravaadi kheme ne muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron par yaa to chuppi saadh lee yaa iskaa virodh kiya
 This proves that his liberal politics is motivated by selfishness
 ' shah ne kaha ki yah hamen samajhnaa hoga ki teen talaak ke khilaaf mahilaon ne lambii ladaai ladi, ve kisi raajnneetik dal se prabhavit nahin thim, balki saamaanya mahilaayein thim
 Responding to the opposition's question of the government taking steps only for Muslim women, Shah has said that in the past, necessary reforms have been made in other religions, be it the law of child marriage, Hindu marriage act, dowry system Be it a law or a Christian act, such reforms have been carried out in all religions
 teen talaak ke maamle main dand ke praavdhaan ko bhi sahi qaraar dete hue shah ne kaha ki pehle bhi divaani maamalon main dand kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 It is noteworthy that the Narendra Modi government, which does not have adequate strength in the Rajya Sabha, was successful in passing the triple talaq bill in the upper house on Tuesday this week despite the objections of several opposition parties, including the Congress
 loksabhaa is vidheyak ko pehle hi paarit chuki thi

 '' Just three days before voting began for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Mehbooba Mufti wept and apologized for this statement
 par kya log unhen maaf karenge? anantnag ke hasanpora gaanv ke tanwir kehete hai, ‘‘ bhala yah ham kaise bhul sakate hai, jab hamaare bachche pallate gan se andhe kiye ja rahe the, un par armivaale goliyaan chalaa rahe the usee vakt jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri kah raheen thim kya ye bachche camp main toffi or doodh lene gaye the
 The He adds, Mehbooba won on the promise of keeping the communal party away from the valley and won and joined hands with the same communal party
 mahabuuba ke aansu unki gaddari ke daag nahin dho sakate
 Despite being the daughter of a prominent Kashmir leader and the Valley's veteran leader and former Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Saeed, Mehbooba's tears are very strange
 lekin kashmir main, khaastaur par dakshin kashmir, jo kuch samay pehle tak mahabuuba or pidipi kaa garh tha, par najar daudaayen to shaayad maujuuda halaat unhen rulaane ke liye kaaphi hai
 Hamida Naeem, a professor at Kashmir University and chairperson of the Kashmir Center for Social and Development Studies, says, "mehbooba now shed any crocodile tears, people are not coming to her notice
 ’’ khiz ke saath ve aage jodatii hai, hindustan ke logon kii tarah kashmir ke log murkh nahin hai, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya lekin vahaan log modi kii jai karte nahin thakte
 But people will not adopt Mehbooba here anymore
 iskaa ehsaas khud mahabuuba ko bhi he
 That is why she is now trying to tell people everywhere that her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was a mistake
 log samaj chuke hai ki mahabuuba satta ke liye paksh yaa vipaksh kahin bhi shaamil ho sakati hai
 Khalid Gul, a senior journalist from South Kashmir, said during an interaction with a website, 'for the first time in the political journey of Mehbooba Mufti, an election seems to be slipping from his hand
 pehali baar mahabuuba ko chunaav se dar lag rahaa he
 "actually Mehbooba's fear is justified
 mahabuuba mufti ne apana pehla chunaav 1996 main congress ke tikat par ladaa tha
 She became very active in South Kashmir after becoming an MLA
 maare gaye aatankiyon ke ghar janaa, giraftaar yuvaaon ko chhudaana, or ghativasiyon ke maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa jamkar virodh karnaa hi unki raajnneeti kii pahchaan rahi he
 But after stopping the BJP, he made such statements continuously that his image became a supporter of the army and the BJP
 ab ve ek baar phir apni chhavi pehali jaisi banane kii koshish main juty hai
 They are shedding crocodile tears during the alliance era with the BJP
 par kya ghativasi unhen maaf karenge? galati maaf kii ja sakati he dhokhaa nahin laal chowk main rahane vaale yusuf kehete hai, galati maaf kii ja sakati he dhokhaa nahin
 For 25 years Mehbooba, who supported the valley, changed her stand in an instant
 yah galati nahin balki siyaasi chaal he
 According to experts, when the Valley expressed full confidence in them, then they joined hands with the BJP after the election by laying a trap of deception
 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 16 siten jeetne vaali piples democratic party (pidipi) ko saal 2014 main 28 siten milin kya milin pidipi ne ghativasiyon kii bhaavana ke khilaaf bhaajapa se haath mila liya
 Mehbooba Mufti has been clarifying this decision in her every speech
 yah kahkar ki unki party ke kai log baagi ho gaye the or unke bina sarkaar banane ko taiyaar the
 People may have been sweating the decision of the coalition taken under political compulsion but after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Burhan Wani in 2016, Mehbooba Mufti made a statement with Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Srinagar in Srinagar
 People came down as a Nashkar
 darasal, unase jab naaballig bacchon ke maare jane par sawaal kiya gaya to unka jawaab tha, ‘‘ye log kya army ke camp main doodh yaa toffee lene gaye the?’ mahabuuba itane gusse main aa gayi ki rajnath singh tak ko unka haath pakadakar unhen chup karana padaa
 PDP candidates from Anantnag seat are former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, Sophie Yusuf from BJP, Hasnain Masoodi from JKN and Ghulam Ahmed Mir from INC
 pichhali baar yahaan se mahabuuba mufti ne jekeen ke ummidavaar mirza mehboob beg ko haraakar jeet hasil kii thi
 BJP got almost equal votes
 jahaan bhaajapa ko 1
 26 percent votes while Nota got 1
 56 fisadi vot mili the
 Currently, the sweat flowing from Mehbooba's forehead while wandering around is revealing her nervousness and the power slipping from her hand
 ek loksabhaa seat or teen charan loktantr kaa majaak?anantnag seat par teen phej main chunaav karwaanaa kahaan tak thik he? nima kahati hai, ‘‘ yah loktantr kaa majaak he
 The Government of India wants to create an atmosphere of panic in Kashmir by electing three phases in a Lok Sabha seat
 puri duniya ko yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki kashmir main itnaa aatank he ki ek seat par teen phej main chunaav karwaane padate hai
 "she further asks if anyone 12
 50 fisadi voting kii sthiti main chunaav ko loktantric mana janaa chahie
 How can an election where even half the people do not vote can be democratic? Actually 12 in the first phase voting held in Anantnag on 23 April
 47 fisadi vot pade to 29 april ko duusare charan kii voting main 9 fisadi vot pade
 There is one phase of voting yet
 to kya koi benchmark banaaya ja saktaa he? nima kahati hai, ‘‘koi phayda nahin, tab logon ko ghaseet-ghasitkar booth tak laayaa jayega
 In fact, Naeem believes that without finding a solution to the Kashmir problem, elections are nothing more than a drama

 'how would you like to sing without genset! Like Rajkumar Lamba, many more parents were seen circling their children's wedding venue
 sabhi kaa wedding planar or tent decorator se ek hi sawaal tha ki jensett ke alaava bijli kaa byaap plan kya he? jawaab naa to wedding planar ke paas tha, naa hi band baaje waalon ke paas

 aisa kabhi nahin hua
 Foreign newspapers also wrote that for the first time a villain emerged in India, on which the applause rings
 achche achche villen aae, lekin kabhi kisi kaa taaliyon se swaagat nahin hua
 These applause took me to the producers-directors
 iske baad diarector mujhe villen kii jagah hero ke taur par lene lage

 Even in Pakistan, children say 'speak silently' Sinha said, i never saw the role as a villain, just like a roll
 main villen main sudharne kaa scope bhi dekha karata tha
 i give a mantra to the young generation to prove themselves to be the best, if you cannot do that, then prove yourself to be different
 aaj khamosh signechar tone ban gaya he
 When i go to Pakistan, the children say, show it silently once
 unhone kaha, apni vaastaviktaa ko mat khoo

 shatru ne kaha ki ye filmein na karne kaa afsos unhen aaj bhi he lekin khushi bhi he ki in filmon ne unke dost ko star bana diya
 According to Shatrughan, it was his fault for not doing these films and keeping in mind this mistake, he never watched both these films

 ab sawaal uthta he kaise?sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru jaise khoonkhaar aatankwaadi ko faansee kii sajaa suna chuke dilli hoicourt ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhish, nyaayamurti es
 N
 dhingra ne kaha, "esaiti agar mulgim (chinmayanand)ke upar bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 376 laga bhi detii to vah adaalat main tik nahin paati
 During the arguments in the court, the defense counsel would have surrounded the SIT in the first hearing itself
 " unhone kaha, "esaiti ab 23 sitambar ko sambandhit tafteesh kii pragati-report, jaanch kii nigaraanee kar rahi elahabaad hoicourt kii do sadasyeey vishesh peeth ke samaksh behad sadhe hue tareeke se rakh sakegi
 "it is noteworthy that Section 376 of the IPC is charged in cases of rape (rape), and the victim has repeatedly accused Swamy of raping her
 phir sawaal uthta he ki yah dhara kyon or kis tarah agency ke liye nuksaandeh or aaropee ke liye laabhadaayak sabit hoti?nyaayamurti dhingra ne kaha, "mulgim par dhara 376 lagaate hi jaanch agency 'haar' jaati
 Legally the accused (swami Chinmayananda) would have won the favor
 yaa yun kahie ki is maamle main aaropee par aaj sidhe-sidhe dushkarm kii dhara 376 na lagaana or uske badale 376-si lagaana aane vaale kal ke liye peedit paksh (ladki) or jaanch karne vaali agency ke liye laabhakaari siddh ho sakati he
 "justice Dhingra continued," The whole incident is very complicated
 maine media main jo kuch dekha-padhaa he, uske aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki shuruyaat swami ne kii
 By holding the nerve to weaken the girl and her family's financial condition
 chunki swami chinmayanandek santhaan ke prabandhak / sanchaalak the, lihaaja unhone ladki or uske parivaar kii ore pratyaksh-paroksh rup se aarthik va anya tamaam madad ke raste khol die, taaki unka shikaar (peedita) khud hi un tak chalakar aa jaae, or maamla jor-jabardastee kaa bhi nahin bane
 But while doing this, the conspirator forgot that his alleged ingenuity could make him accused of Section '376-C'
 "nyaayamurti dhingra ne kaha, "mulgim ke paas takat he, lihaaja usne peedita ko maansik rup se dabaav main le liya
 To the extent that illegal practices such as sexual harassment, gang molestation, blackmailing and extortion money went on their own
 inhen tamaam halaaton ke maddenjar esaiti ne aaropee par sidhe-sidhe dushkarm (rape) kii dhara 376 na lagaakar, 376-si lagaai he
 "justice Dhingra further said," The section of the Indian Penal Code is made for imposing a sentence by the manager / operator of an institution to punish a woman / girl (adult) under her or for persuading her to have sex
 376-C
 " uttar pradesh ke purv police mahanideshak vikram singh bhi is mudde par nyaayamurti dhingra kii raay se ittefaq rakhte hai
 He said, "so far as the question is to impose 376-C on the accused without directly imposing Section 376, it is absolutely correct
 esaiti ne agar dushkarm (rape) kii dhara-376 laga di hoti to pehali hi sunwaayee main court main vakeelon kii bahes main maamla aundhe munh gir jaataa
 "the accused is the director of an institute," said Vikram Singh, and he lured the law student of all sorts
 jaise hi ladki ek khaas kism ke dabaab main ai, aaropee uske saath antarang hota chalaa gaya
 The SIT is investigating what happened then
 "1974 batch ke upra kader ke purv ipies adhikari vikram singh ne kaha, "jaisaa maine media main dekha-padhaa-suna he, us nazariye se to yah puraa cond hi girohabandi, blakemeling, jabaran dhan vasuuli, yon-utpeedan kaa lag rahaa he
 The whole script's horror script is based on deception
 jab jahaan jaise bhi jiskaa daanv laga, usne saamne vaale kaa beja istemaal kar liya
 "it is noteworthy that if the charge is proved under Section 376 of the IPC, the convict can be punished from 10 years of imprisonment to life imprisonment
 saath hi arthdand bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 But, under Section 376-C, there is a provision of a minimum of five years of imprisonment or a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment if the charge is proved
 saath hi adaalat doshi par arthdand bhi laga sakati he

 Atishi has told the Tis Hazari court in his petition that Gambhir does not have the right to vote
 lihaaja, gambhir ko court disqualifi kare
 According to Atishi, it is a crime to have a voter ID card in two places
 haalanki court aatishi ke tarkon se santusht nahin dikhaa
 During the hearing, the court said that the Election Commission can file or take action against Gautam Gambhir regarding two voter ID cards
 lekin aatishi jo khud usee jagah se duusari party se chunaav lard rahi hai, kaise gautam gambhir ke khilaaf cese daal sakati hai

 baharhaal, ab yah maamla dilli main chunaav hone ke baad hi suna jayega
 Elections are due in Delhi on May 12 and the court will pronounce the verdict on Atishi's application on May 13
 court ko yah faisla karnaa he ki aatishi kii yachika ko sweekaar kiya jaae yaa phir khaarij
 If the petition is accepted, then Gautam Gambhir can be summoned in this case or before that the court can get the preliminary investigation report from Delhi Police
 lekin philhal is maamle main gautam gambhir ke liye raahat kii khabar he kyonki dilli main chunaav se pehle is maamle main court kaa koi faisla nahin aayega
 After taking the case of two Voter ID cards of Gautam Gambhir of Atishi Marlena to the court, another petition has been filed in the Tis Hazari court on behalf of the BJP also for Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal having two voter ID cards

 iskaa arth he- i ladki, mujh par yah kaatil gussa kyon?rahul ne is twit ke jariye jai shah kaa mudda uthaae jane par bijepi ke gusse ko rekhaankit kiya he
 He called the attack on the BJP the same day the BJP sought clarification on the relationship between Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra and arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari
 congress isse pehle yah mudda uthaa chuki he ki jai shah kii company kaa karobaar ek saal main 50,000 rupee se badhkar 80 karod rupee tak kaise pahunch gaya
 The party has also questioned the silence of the Prime Minister on this issue and has demanded the Supreme Court judges to investigate the matter
 bijepi ne aarope ko khaarij kiya he or kaha he ki jai shah kaa kaarobaar puri tarah vaid he
 The party has also rejected the Congress' charge that the BJP is promoting gross capitalism

 The truth is that today we wanted to prime time on the subject whether celebrity should take responsibility for the brand
 aaj kendriya khaadya mantri ramvilas paswan ne jaankaree di ki central kanzumar protection council ne faisalaa kiya he ki kisi bhi product ke liye celibritiz ko bhi zimmedaar mana jayega
 In such a situation, celebrities should get all the information related to that product before doing any advertisement
 celebrati kii zimmedaari kii baat to ham kar rahe hai or is mudde par charchaa honi bhi chahie, kyonki ab to aapke saansad bhi utpaada kaa vigyaapan kar rahe hai
 If the responsibility for the celebrity is there, will the accountability of the MP coming in the advertisement be decided? This is also a serious matter but only then an email came from Mumbai office
 is email ne zimmedaari ke sawaal ko sire se palat diya
 i felt that Yogita was also no less than a celebrity
 wo 11 saal kii he, to kya hua
 But i do not know who will take responsibility for Yogita and who will hold Yogita responsible
 hamaare paas pani bharte hue yogita kii tasviir nahin he lekin ham kinhin or tasveeron ke zariye uski kahani bataanaa chaahate hai
 Yogita is the name of an 11-year-old girl from Beed district near Latur
 jo apane ghar se 400 meter dur lage handpump se pani bharne jaaya karti he
 Would be kind if you sit in the drawing room and quickly imagine the distance 400 meters
 tab samajhnaa aasaan hoga ki handpump se gadaa bharkar ghar tak aane main kitni mehnat lagati hogi
 Because then you will be able to understand the story of Yogita how hard it would take to fill the water with the hand pump and bring it home
 aam taur par ek ghade ko bharne main do ghante lag jate hai
 The hand pump is not empty, so there must be a line there
 mujhe to yakeen nahin ho rahaa he ki yogita ek chakkar main 10 litre pani bhar kar ghar le aati he
 i was also asked to believe that she takes 8 to 10 trips on a holiday
 is hisaab se is umr main wo ek din main 80 litre pani bhar kar laati hogi
 Santia, who went to dry cover, said that hand pumps are very difficult to operate
 bachche ko kaaphi takat lagaani hoti he tab jaakar pani mushkil se nikalataa he
 In such a heat, go out for water throughout the day, get in line and come home with a pot and then leave for another shipment
 yogita ab apni kahani bataane ke liye is duniya main nahin he
 If she was, she never used or was in her sentences, so we did not
 hamaare sahyogi manoj satpude kaa kahana he ki yogita pani bharte-bharte mar gai
 By filling the pot for the house, the water in his body was destroyed
 ravivaar ko yogita 10 litre pani lekar ghar ai thi
 This was his first affair
 duusare chakkar ke liye ghar se nikali or handpump ke paas behosh ho gai
 From there she was taken to the hospital where she could not survive
 shanivaar ko usne do hi chakkar lagaae the
 Manoj Satpude could not talk to the doctor, our colleague Santia also called the doctor but could not talk
 deth certificate par likhaa hua he ki bacchee ko hit stroke or baari dihidration tha
 That is, there was heatstroke and there was shortage of water
 cardio respiretiri disorder ke kaaran dil or fefde ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 This happens due to lack of water in the body and sunstroke
 jis din yogita kii maut hui us din bid kaa tapaman 44 degree celsius tha
 Yogita has an elder brother of 15 years
 wo ravivaar ko baahar gaya hua tha
 At the age of 15, outside must have gone to play or study or to friends' house
 mata pita hai
 When the burden of filling water came on Yogita, she could not cope
 bahut saare bachche is sookhe ke kaaran haadtod mehnat kar rahe hai
 When the whole house is busy bringing water, then you can think about how much food their body will get
 ham lagaataar tasveeron main dekh rahe hai ki sookhe ke kaaran marathavada main auraton or bacchon kii zindagi kitni badal gai he
 What do you know and you have become normal by looking at these pictures and are engaged in playing matches on Twitter, what work was done during whose government
 is jhooth ko failaane main lage hon ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he, jaise pani kii rail chalane se hi samaadhaan ho gaya ho
 Today another incident has taken place from Bangalore
 times of india ne likhaa he ki karnataka main sookhe kaa asar kuposhan ke shikaar bacchon par kaaphi gaharaa pad rahaa he
 By not drinking clean water, children have started getting diseases ranging from diarrhea to cholera
 raichur, kalburgi, bellari jaise ilaakon main taapmaana bhi 44 degree ke paar chalaa gaya he
 In these areas, 30 percent of children under 5 years of age are malnourished
 ek daawey ke anusaar 2010 se 2016 ke bich yahaan 3000 bacchon kii maut hui he
 What to tell about the hospital the child would have received at the time of diarrhea cholera in the village countryside
 sookhaa padataa he to pani ke saath ghar main anaaj kii kami ho jaati he, aamadani kam ho jaati he to baahar se kharid kar laane kaa bhi sawaal nahin hota
 If the child eats less, there is no need to tell him what will happen
 kyonki ham sab hindu-muslim topic main itane paarangat ho gaye hai ki ye sab masale to chutki jaise lagate honge
 Doctors are saying that malnourished children are at risk of various diseases
 kai bacchon ko mushkil se do vakt kaa khaanaa mil paata he
 This is Karnataka, from where Bharat Software is going to be a super power
 mangalvaar ke 'indian express' main girish kuber ne ek lekh likhaa he jisamen bataaya he ki ye sookhaa prakruti ke kaaran nahin, balki insaani karatuuton ke kaaran aayaa he
 Marathwada has received 40 percent less rainfall
 lekin kya yahi kaaran ho saktaa he
 The national average of rainfall last year is 1100 mm and Maharashtra received 1300 mm, which is more than the national average
 marathavada main rashtriya ausat se kaaphi kam 882 mimi barish hui or vidarbha main 1034 mimi yani rashtriya ausat se adhik
 But the average rainfall in Rajasthan is not more than 400 mm, so why not there is a situation like Marathwada there
 girish kuber ne bataaya he ki iskaa kaaran yahi he ki sabhi sarkaron ne milakar maharashtra main pani kii samasya ko andekha kiya he
 There are 205 Chinese miles in Maharashtra
 ganne kii kheti ke liye aap jaanate hai ki pani kaaphi lagata he
 Kuber has written that the government states that sugarcane is cultivated on only 4 per cent of the land in Maharashtra, but it does not say that 4 per cent of the land cane is 71 of the state's water
 5 pratishat hissaa pi jaataa he
 Everyone knows this
 lekin china milon ke dam par rajya kii raajnneeti or netaaon kaa samrajya tikaa hua he
 This is also not a matter
 maharashtra jaanata he lekin maharashtra aise bartaav karata he jaise ye baat nahin jaanata he
 In the last three years, 20 Chinese miles have opened in Marathwada
 vahaan 70 chini mile hai
 Now the Maharashtra government has said that the sugar miles will not open for the next five years, but until you do not understand the politics there through these sugar mills, this problem will neither be solved, nor will it be discussed properly
 tippaniyan Our partners Srinivasan Jain, Tejas Mehta, Santia have visited those areas properly
 tamaam marathi, angreji akhabaaron se lekar news site par bhi isaki charchaa he
 Every time there is so much discussion but there is no solution
 kavita ayyar ne 'indian express' main likhaa he ki maharashtra ke anya shaharon main bhi pani kaa gambhir sankat he
 In Hingoli town, people are getting water on three days as they are getting it in three days, they are considering it as their fate
 teraa lakh kii aabaadi vaale aurangabad main bhi logon ko duusare yaa tisare din nigam kaa pani mil rahaa he
 One of the 98 smart cities selected across the country is also to be built in Aurangabad
 pani kii haalat dekhakar lagata he yahaan pani email se aayegaa
 There is a demand of 100 million liters of water per day in Nanded but only 50 million liters per day is available
 vahi haal parabhani or jaalnaa kaa bhi he
 Prasad Kathe reports that the state government is supplying water to 4356 tanker affected areas
 hazaron tanker lagane ke baad bhi sankat kaa yah swaroop he
 Even after the death of Yogita, if we cannot see how the drought may have affected the children from Marathwada to Bundelkhand then what can be done
 kya aapane suna he ki sookhaa prabhavit ilaakon main bacchon ke liye kya kuch kiya ja rahaa he
 Children are seen filling the water everywhere
 bachche nahin bharenge to pani nahin aayega or pani bharenge to baccha mar jayega

 In such a heat, go out for water throughout the day, get in line and come home with a pot and then leave for another shipment
 yogita ab apni kahani bataane ke liye is duniya main nahin he
 If she was, she never used or was in her sentences, so we did not
 hamaare sahyogi manoj satpude kaa kahana he ki yogita pani bharte-bharte mar gai
 By filling the pot for the house, the water in his body ran out
 ravivaar ko yogita 10 litre pani lekar ghar ai thi
 This was his first affair
 duusare chakkar ke liye ghar se nikali or handpump ke paas behosh ho gai
 From there she was taken to the hospital where she could not survive
 shanivaar ko usne do hi chakkar lagaae the
 Manoj Satpude could not talk to the doctor, our colleague Santia also called the doctor but could not talk
 deth certificate par likhaa hua he ki bacchee ko hit stroke or baari dihidration tha
 That is, there was heatstroke and there was shortage of water
 cardio respiretiri disorder ke kaaran dil or fefde ne kaam karnaa band kar diya
 This happens due to lack of water in the body and sunstroke
 jis din yogita kii maut hui us din bid kaa tapaman 44 degree celsius tha
 Yogita has an elder brother of 15 years
 wo ravivaar ko baahar gaya hua tha
 At the age of 15, outside must have gone to play or study or to friends' house
 mata pita hai
 When the burden of filling water came on Yogita, she could not cope
 bahut saare bachche is sookhe ke kaaran haadtod mehnat kar rahe hai
 When the whole house is busy bringing water, then you can think about how much food their body will get
 ham lagaataar tasveeron main dekh rahe hai ki sookhe ke kaaran marathavada main auraton or bacchon kii zindagi kitni badal gai he
 What do you know and you have become normal by looking at these pictures and are engaged in playing matches on Twitter, what work was done during whose government
 is jhooth ko failaane main lage hon ki pehali baar pani kii rail chali he, jaise pani kii rail chalane se hi samaadhaan ho gaya ho
 Today another incident has taken place from Bangalore
 times of india ne likhaa he ki karnataka main sookhe kaa asar kuposhan ke shikaar bacchon par kaaphi gaharaa pad rahaa he
 By not drinking clean water, children have started getting diseases ranging from diarrhea to cholera
 raichur, kalburgi, bellari jaise ilaakon main taapmaana bhi 44 degree ke paar chalaa gaya he
 In these areas, 30 percent of children under 5 years of age are malnourished
 ek daawey ke anusaar 2010 se 2016 ke bich yahaan 3000 bacchon kii maut hui he
 What to tell about the hospital the child would have received at the time of diarrhea cholera in the village countryside
 sookhaa padataa he to pani ke saath ghar main anaaj kii kami ho jaati he, aamadani kam ho jaati he to baahar se kharid kar laane kaa bhi sawaal nahin hota
 If the child eats less, there is no need to tell him what will happen
 kyonki ham sab hindu-muslim topic main itane paarangat ho gaye hai ki ye sab masale to chutki jaise lagate honge
 Doctors are saying that malnourished children are at risk of various diseases
 kai bacchon ko mushkil se do vakt kaa khaanaa mil paata he
 This is Karnataka, from where Bharat Software is going to be a super power
 mangalvaar ke 'indian express' main girish kuber ne ek lekh likhaa he jisamen bataaya he ki ye sookhaa prakruti ke kaaran nahin, balki insaani karatuuton ke kaaran aayaa he
 Marathwada has received 40 percent less rainfall
 lekin kya yahi kaaran ho saktaa he
 The national average of rainfall last year is 1100 mm and Maharashtra received 1300 mm, which is more than the national average
 marathavada main rashtriya ausat se kaaphi kam 882 mimi barish hui or vidarbha main 1034 mimi yani rashtriya ausat se adhik
 But the average rainfall in Rajasthan is not more than 400 mm, so why not there is a situation like Marathwada there
 girish kuber ne bataaya he ki iskaa kaaran yahi he ki sabhi sarkaron ne milakar maharashtra main pani kii samasya ko andekha kiya he
 There are 205 Chinese miles in Maharashtra
 ganne kii kheti ke liye aap jaanate hai ki pani kaaphi lagata he
 Kuber has written that the government states that sugarcane is cultivated on only 4 per cent of the land in Maharashtra, but it does not say that 4 per cent of the land cane is 71 of the state's water
 5 pratishat hissaa pi jaataa he
 Everyone knows this
 lekin china milon ke dam par rajya kii raajnneeti or netaaon kaa samrajya tikaa hua he
 This is also not a matter
 maharashtra jaanata he lekin maharashtra aise bartaav karata he jaise ye baat nahin jaanata he
 In the last three years, 20 Chinese miles have opened in Marathwada
 vahaan 70 chini mile hai
 Now the Maharashtra government has said that the sugar miles will not open for the next five years, but until you do not understand the politics there through these sugar mills, this problem will neither be solved, nor will it be discussed properly
 tippaniyan Our partners Srinivasan Jain, Tejas Mehta, Santia have visited those areas properly
 tamaam marathi, angreji akhabaaron se lekar news site par bhi isaki charchaa he
 Every time there is so much discussion but there is no solution
 kavita ayyar ne 'indian express' main likhaa he ki maharashtra ke anya shaharon main bhi pani kaa gambhir sankat he
 In Hingoli town, people are getting water on three days as they are getting it in three days, they are considering it as their fate
 teraa lakh kii aabaadi vaale aurangabad main bhi logon ko duusare yaa tisare din nigam kaa pani mil rahaa he
 One of the 98 smart cities selected across the country is also to be built in Aurangabad
 pani kii haalat dekhakar lagata he yahaan pani email se aayegaa
 There is a demand of 100 million liters of water per day in Nanded but only 50 million liters per day is available
 vahi haal parabhani or jaalnaa kaa bhi he
 Prasad Kathe reports that the state government is supplying water to 4356 tanker affected areas
 hazaron tanker lagane ke baad bhi sankat kaa yah swaroop he
 Even after the death of Yogita, if we cannot see how the drought may have affected the children from Marathwada to Bundelkhand then what can be done
 kya aapane suna he ki sookhaa prabhavit ilaakon main bacchon ke liye kya kuch kiya ja rahaa he
 Children are seen filling the water everywhere
 bachche nahin bharenge to pani nahin aayega or pani bharenge to baccha mar jayega
 Yogita is no longer in this world to tell her story
 wo hoti to apane vaakyon main kabhi tha yaa thi kaa istemaal nahin karti isliye hamane bhi nahin kiya
 Our colleague Manoj Satpude says that Yogita died while filling water
 ghar ke liye gadaa bharte-bharte uske sharir kaa pani khatm ho gaya
 On Sunday, Yogita came home with 10 liters of water
 ye uskaa pehla chakkar tha
 Got out of the house for the second affair and fainted near the handpump
 vahaan se use aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan wo batch nahin saki
 On Saturday, he made two rounds
 manoj satpude kii doctor se baat nahin ho saki, hamaari sahyogi santiya ne bhi doctor ko phone lagaaya magar baat nahin ho saki
 It is written on the death certificate that the girl had heat stroke and heavy dehydration
 yani lu lagi thi or pani kii kami ho gai thi
 Heart and lung stopped working due to cardio respiratory disorder
 sharir main pani kii kami or lu lagane se aisa hota he
 Beed's temperature was 44 degrees Celsius on the day Yogita died
 yogita kaa ek bada bhai he 15 saal kaa
 He went out on Sunday
 15 saal kii umr main baahar kaa matlab khilne yaa padhane hi gaya hoga yaa phir doston ke ghar gaya hoga
 Are the parents
 pani bharne kaa bhaar yogita par aayaa to wo jhel na saki
 Many children are working hard due to this drought
 jab sara ghar pani laane main laga hoga tab aap soch sakate hai ki unke sharir ko kitni khuraaq milti hogi
 We are constantly seeing in pictures how much the lives of women and children have changed in Marathwada due to the drought
 kya pataa ham or aap in tasveeron ko dekhte dekhte saamaanya ho gaye hon or twitor par match khilne main lage hon ki kiski sarkaar ke samay kya-kya kaam hua
 Let us spread the lie that for the first time the water rail has gone, as if the solution has been solved by running the water rail
 aaj bangaloru se ek or ghatana hui he
 The Times of India has written that the impact of drought in Karnataka is greatly impacting children with malnutrition
 saaf pani na pine se bacchon ko diaria se lekar kolra tak kii beemaari hone lagi he
 Temperatures in Raichur, Kalburgi, Bellary have also crossed 44 degrees
 in ilaakon main 5 saal ke neeche ke 30 pratishat bachche kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 According to one claim 3000 children died here between 2010 and 2016
 gaanv dehaat main dast colera hone ke samay bachche ko jo aspataal miltaa hoga uske bare main kya bataayen
 If there is a drought, there is a shortage of food grains in the house with water, income is reduced, so there is no question of buying from outside
 baccha kam khayega to kya hoga ab ye to bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Because we have become so well versed in the hindu-muslim topic that all these issues must have seemed like a pinch
 doctor log kah rahe hai ki kuposhan ke shikaar bacchon ko tarah-tarah kii bimariyon kaa khatara he
 Many children barely get two meals a day
 ye karnataka he, jahaan se bharat software se koi super power banane vaala he
 In Tuesday's 'indian Express' Girish Kubera has written an article stating that this drought is not due to nature, but due to human misdeeds
 marathavada main 40 pratishat kam barish hui he
 But could this be the reason? pichley saal barish kaa rashtriya ausat 1100 mimi he or maharashtra kaa 1300 mimi yani maharashtra main rashtriya ausat se zyada barish hui
 Marathwada received 882 mm of rainfall far below the national average and Vidarbha had 1034 mm of rainfall, which is higher than the national average
 lekin rajasthan main to ausat varsha 400 mimi se adhik hi nahin rahi to, vahaan kyon nahin marathavada jaise halaat hai
 Girish Kubera has told that the reason for this is that all the governments together have ignored the water problem in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main 205 chini mile hai
 For sugarcane cultivation, you know that water takes a lot
 kuber ne likhaa he ki sarkaar bataati he ki maharashtra main sirf 4 pratishat bhoomi par ganne kii kheti hoti he, lekin yah nahin bataati he ki 4 pratishat zamin par laga ganna rajya ke pani kaa 71
 The 5 percent share is drunk
 yah sabko pataa he
 But on the basis of China Miles, the politics of the state and the empire of leaders are intact
 yah bhi koi nahin baat nahin he
 Maharashtra knows but Maharashtra behaves as if it does not know
 pichley teen saal main marathavada main 20 chini mile khuli hai
 There are 70 sugar mills
 ab maharashtra sarkaar ne kaha he ki agle paanch saal tak chini mile nahin khulengi, lekin jab tak aap in chini milon ke zariye vahaan kii raajnneeti ko nahin samajhenge, is samasya kaa to na samaadhaan hoga, na is par thik se baat
 The comments hamaare sahyogi shrinivasana jain, tejas mehta, santiya ne un ilaakon kaa thik-thaak daura kiya he
 It is also discussed in various Marathi, English newspapers and news sites
 har baar itani charchaa to ho jaati he magar samaadhaan nahin hota
 Kavita Iyer has written in the 'indian Express' that there is a serious water crisis in other cities of Maharashtra
 hingoli kasbe main logon ko teen din par pani mil rahaa he chunki teen din main mil ja rahaa he wo ise hi apni kismat samaj rahe hai
 In Aurangabad, with a population of thirteen lakhs, people are getting corporation water on the second or third day
 desh bhar main chune gaye 98 smart city main se ek aurangabad main bhi bananaa he
 Seeing the condition of water, it seems that water will come here by email
 nanded main 100 million litre prati din pani kii maang he lekin uplabdh he maatr 50 million litre prati din
 The same situation is also with Parbhani and Jalna
 prasad kathe kii report he ki rajya sarkaar 4356 tankeron se prabhavit ilaakon main pani kii supplai ho rahi he
 This is a form of crisis even after thousands of tankers are installed
 yogita kii maut ke baad bhi agar ham nahin dekh paa rahe hai ki sookhe ne marathavada se lekar bundelkhand tak ke bacchon ko kaise prabhavit kiya hoga to kya kiya ja saktaa he
 Have you heard what is being done for children in drought affected areas
 har taraf bachche pani bharte nazar aa rahe hai
 If the children do not fill, then there will be no water and if they fill water, the child will die
 jis din yogita kii maut hui us din bid kaa tapaman 44 degree celsius tha
 Yogita has an elder brother of 15 years
