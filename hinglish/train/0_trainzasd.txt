 The Election Commission on Thursday rejected the 'bloody claw' remarks made during election campaigning in Chhattisgarh and asked them to be more vigilant during future public dialogues
 modi kii tippanee par kadaa sangyaan lete hue ayog ne kaha ki vah aachaar samhita ulanghan ke liye apane notice ke jawaab main modi ke spashtikaran se santusht nahin he
 The Election Commission told Modi that comments like 'bloody claw', 'bloodthirsty' in the context of political opponents are considered fatal in terms of decent political statements
 chunaav ayog ne apane aadesh main kaha ki maamle ke tathyon or paristhitiyon tathaa sandarbh ke tahat aapke dwaara apane jawaab main die gaye tarkon ko lekar ayog maamle main apni naapsandgi vyakt karata he or ummid karata he ki bhavishya main aap apane saarvajanik samvaad ke dauraan adhik satark rahenge
 The Congress had lodged a complaint with the Election Commission regarding Modi's remarks as 'hand' is his election symbol
 ayog ne teen prishth ke aadesh main netaaon par nijee hamalon ke maamle main saarvajanik samvaad kii bhashaa ko lekar apni chintaa tathaa kade maanakon kaa paalan karne kii aavashyaktaa par jor diya or modi se kaha ki yah aapke rukh ko sweekaar nahin karata
 The Election Commission said, 'the Commission believes that while criticizing the policies, programs and past records of political parties, the expression and statement, whether used in colloquial language, should be such that it maintains decency, dignity and public morality 
 ’ The order said, "when your accents, intent and use of the words 'bloody paw' and 'blood hands' are read in the context of your entire speech, then there is no room for doubt that this complainant party and its election symbol Is in context and it is a violation of the provisions of the Model Code of Conduct
 ’ The Commission said that it has taken note of Modi's assurance that as a responsible leader he is committed to all the rules and guidelines and to the Model Code of Conduct of the Election Commission and hopes that he will stick to his point in future
 ayog ne kaha ki samvidhan main bolne or abhivyakti kaa buniyadi adhikaar diya gaya he lekin iskaa paalan is tarah kiya janaa chahie ki yah shishtataa or naitikta kii simaaon ko paar nahin kare yaa manahani nahin kare yaa saarvajanik vyavastha nahin bigaade
 In response to nine pages on the notice of the Commission, Modi denied the violation of the Model Code of Conduct on his 'bloody claw' statement
 modi ne kaha tha ki unhone congress kii nitiyon or kaamkaaj kii aalochana karte hue keval apane bolne kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kaa prayog kiya he or is tarah kisi aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin kiya
 Modi said, 'I clearly believe that i did not violate the said provision
 ’ unhone apane jawaab main likhaa tha ki vah bhi kaaphi aalochanaon kaa shikaar hue hai or unke khilaaf apshabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he lekin unhone raajnneetik vichaaron kii maryaada ko banaaye rakhaa or apane virodhiyon par nijee hamalaa nahin kiya he
 According to Modi, he did not make accusations against the Congress in the form of a false way and what he said is not unverified and completely public
 unhone kaha ki virdohi kii aalochana chunaav ke dauraan avashyambhavi he or ‘khooni panja’ tathaa ‘jaalim haath’ vaale bayaan hind kii lokapriy lokokti hai jinka istemaal keval alankaarik rup se kiya gaya
 Modi had said, 'it has been used only as a form of speech
 ’ chunaav ayog ne modi ke bayaan par 13 november ko notice jari kar unhen 20 november tak jawaab dene ko kaha tha

 Film Review: Chennai expressactor: Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Satyaraj, Nikitan Dheer, Priyamniduration: 2 hours 22 minutesdirector: Rohit Shetteen starten Point Review 1
 ek ladkaa tha
 Dark-skinned, with an average face and a saddle
 usne nabbe ke dashak main hamen sikhaaya ki bholepan ke saath, sahi niyat ke saath or smartnes ke saath pyaar karo to use hasil bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 He created a belief around romance
 darjanon filmein baniin us ladke shahrukh ke ird gird jinhone is falsafe ko nae nae adhyay muhaiyaa karaae
 'chennai Express' now reminds me of the memories of the boy who has become middle aged again and again
 film kii shuruyaat main hi 'didlje' kii tarj par shahrukh train se latakate hai or daravaaje kii taraf betahasha bhaagti deepika ko haath badhaate hai
 In this film, many film images of Shahrukh, his style, his songs are used well
 isliye shahrukh ke diwaanon ko ek film main shahrukh kii jarney kaa reference dekhnaa lubhaata he
 2
 ek or ladkaa he, rohit shetty
 The father was action director Shetty
 so usne jo pehali film banaai 'jameen', usamen jamkar ection rakhaa
 But the film did not work
 rohit ko sabak mila ki ection to thik he, magar public ko anterten karne ke liye kamedi kii dose bhi chahie
 Then came the 'golmaal' franchise, films like 'bol Bachchan' and 'singham', which showed a great combination of these two
 achche gane, sichuational kamedi, ek lav story or aisa ection jo hero ko hero banaata he
 'chennai Express' has all the same
 magar isamen ek cheez or jud gai, jiskaa zikr upar kiya gaya
 Shahrukh Khan
 ye bada daanv tha, jo puri tarah se kaamyaab nahin hua he
 The thing that we are used to missing is Shahrukh in 'chennai Express'
 ajay devgan kaa bhujaa fadakaata ection
 Apart from this, the screen image on the character also overlapped
 in sabko bhul jaaen to rohit shetty kii filmon ke diwaanon ko niraash nahin hona padegaa
 3
 'chennai express' kii kahani kuch yun he ki rahul ke maa papa nahin hai
 Grandfather was there
 ab nahin hai wo, magar he uski daadi kaa kaha, ki rahul ko mumbai se rameshwar jaakar dada ji kii asthiyaan bahaani hai
 But turned 40 and Rahul has to go to Goa with friends, looking for fun
 daadi kaa man rakhane ke liye wo chennai express train main savaar hota he, agle stesan par utarane ke liye
 But he lands on a new land
 dakshin bharat main, jisko lekar lakh fasaane hai uttar bharatiyon ke
 Watching movies, listening to stories, being bored and stuttering on the ground of reality
 baharhaal
 Rahul meets Meena on the train to escape the wedding from home
 minaa ke pher main rahul ek gaanv main pahunchataa he
 Meena's don meets father
 minaa ke daavedaar ek pahalwaan se dikhte yuvak se miltaa he
 Run
 bacho
 Wait
 phir bhaago
 In this turn, love falls and in the last, it is all right if we say in Shah Rukh's Philosophy
 4
 Chennai Express is a Hindi film
 magar isamen kirdaar or lokation ke chalate tamil kaa bhi jamkar istemaal hua he
 It makes most of the audience laugh, but in the words of a Punjabi aunt who came out watching a Delhi film, Ille Ille does not understand after a point
 tamil ke alaava hindi jaanane or na jaanane ko lekar gadha gaya haas zyaadaatar darshakon ko acha lagata he
 If you are fond of good cinema, you can feel sorry for yourself
 magar rohit shetty ne kabhi is trick ko chupaaya bhi to nahin
 So how is the complaint
 5
 The songs of the film are good and many new songs are added to the album of Shah Rukh's romantic films
 van tu thri four main priyamani taaja dikhi hai
 In the Butterfly song, Deepika is fragrant in many types of South Indian sarees amidst flowers
 duusare gane bhi achche hai
 But after a time when you feel that there should be something strong in the story now
 gaanaa aa jaataa he
 But perhaps this is regular masala Hindi cinema
 jahaan paryaavaran kii raksha kaa sandesh dene ke liye hero kaa hare bhare maidaanon main matakna machalanaa lajimi he
 6
 film hamen dakshin bharat kii tameez or tareeke dikhaati he
 Rohit was still stuck in Mumbai, Goa
 magar yahaan ek nayaa bharat dikhataa he
 Waterfalls, mountains, colorful villages, fields and beaches
 camera work or lokation, in donon morchon par fateh hasil hui he film ko
 7
 jaisaa vaada he, film main jamkar kamedi he
 Sometimes the practice of singing songs in a twisted manner, sometimes a comedy of circumstances born of the combination of Tamil and Hindi
 in sabakaa kota puraa hua, to bouna mil gaya, kuch mote log aa gaye or in sabaki kute laanat malaanat karne ke liye rahul ne daaru pikar danga bhi kar diya
 Rohit knows that Sirius is a legend for cinema, but what the public comes to do after getting a ticket for three hours and hundreds of rupees is fun
 or unki movie apane tain khub majaa detii he aam bhartiya darshak ko
 8
 shahrukh khan ko pyaar karte dekhnaa bhaataa he
 But here he is seen as a lover at the very last
 usase pehle vah halaat se jujhate ek aadmi hai
 In such a situation, he could not do anything new, better
 kamedi ke lihaaj se kahen to zyada jame nahin shahrukh
 Deepika definitely played rum in Meena's role
 unke or shahrukh ke bich kii chemistry lekin zyada kulbulaahat paidaa nahin kar pai
 Shahrukh's action also does not inspire much confidence due to his height
 baar-baar hawa main uchhalkar sher kii dahaad ke becoground score main jhapatta maarthe ajay yaad aa rahe the
 The rest of the cast was just to laugh and Rohit was posted as their master for this work
 acha ye rahaa ki shetty team ke regular phase film main nahin the to kuch nayaapan tha
 9
 film ke prachaar ke dauraan daawa kiya ja rahaa tha ki ye ek hi mulk main kabhi rashtriyataon ke, bhashaaon ke, tahjeebon ke fark ko dikhaati or phir patati najar aegi
 For this, a love story chosen as a thread that threads everyone
 magar aakhri main 'chak de india' kii sattar minute vaali spich kii tarah minaa ke pita ke saamne rahul kii spich usee nishkarsh par khatm hui ki pyaar kii koi bandhi hui bhashaa nahin hoti
 But we already knew this
 he ki nahin
 10
 film dekhen, agar shahrukh, rohit shetty, deepika padukon, bollywood kii kamedi filmon, gaanon, naach or dhuandhar car udaoo ection ke fain hai
 Do not miss the song made by South superhero Rajni Anna's Yoyo Honey Singh in the last of the film
 jaisaa minaa rahul ko kahati he kahaan se kharidi aisi bakawaas dictionari
 So remove the word nonsense from your dictionary, then you can enjoy the family and especially Chennai Xpress with children
 lekhak-geetkaar prasoon joshi kaa maananaa he ki bachche agar paryaavaran ko bachaane ke liye aage aaen, to ve bada parivartan laa sakate hai

 a fact has also been found that the number of children below five years of age in the village is very good, and most of them are ill everyday
 
 
 pehali nazar main to laga tha ki gaanv main shauchalay kii vyavastha hi nahin he, lekin jab gaanv ke sarpanch se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki varsh 2010 main sarkaar ne is gaanv main 189 shauchalay banawaye the
 
 
 Despite this, there was a lot of mankind lying in the village, after which it was difficult to digest that the people of the village had toilet facilities
 
 
 maine sarpanch ke saath jaakar shauchalayon kaa gauge liya to dekha ki 189 main se lagbhag 125 puri tarah tod die gaye hai
 
 
 Even people have removed their bricks and put them in their houses, some in the walls, some in the courtyard
 
 
 shauchalayon ke liye khode gaye gadde kachra jalaane ke kaam aa rahe hai
 
 
 Different reasons and excuses were heard when the villagers were asked the reason for not using toilets
 
 
 kisi ne kaha, shauchalay main baithne kii aadat nahin he, kisi ko shauchalay bahut chota lagata he
 
 
 More than 125 toilets were astonished to see the plight, as the people of the village were blaming the government for the filth
 
 
 iske baad maine sarpanch se kahkar un shauchalayon kaa haal jaanane kaa prayaas kiya, jo bache hue the
 
 
 The number of such toilets was around 60
 
 
 so, pehle ham pahunche ek bujurg mahila gopibai ke ghar, jahaan jaakar pataa chalaa ki sarkaar dwaara shauchalay main lagavaaya gaya daravaaza ab gopibai ke ghar kaa mukhyadwar he
 
 
 When i asked Gopibai the reason for this, the answer was that if the people of the house do not use the toilet, then they put the door in the house
 
 
 main hairaan hokar sunata rahaa
 
 
 Even after this, many such houses were seen where there was a toilet, but no one used it
 
 
 kisi ke ghar par shauchalay main bacchon ke khilone rakhe the, kisi ke ghar main lakdi or upale
 
 
 But almost all the houses were telling the mindset of the villagers, that they like to go for open defecation in spite of having toilets
 
 
 iske baad hamaari team ne gaanv ke logon ke saath baithak kii or gaanv ke mahilaon-purushon ko khule main shouch jane ke gambhir parinaamon ke bare main jaankaree di
 
 
 We also told them about the ill effects on children's health, but it seemed clear from their reactions that it was almost impossible to change their mindset
 
 
 phir bhi kahin na kahin yah ummid he ki aise gaanv bhi jald hi teji se badalati duniya kaa hissaa banenge, or apane or apane bacchon ke swasthya par dhyaan dekar gaanv ke vikaas ko nai urja denge

 ek ritred justise jo sirf prachaar ke liye bolte hai or ek sadhvi jinhen khuda jane koun gambhirtha se letaa he, ne gandhi ko angrejon kaa agent ghoshit kar diya he
 In this country, abusing Gandhi has become a fashion, an idiom
 gandhi ke bare main sabase katu baaten bolne waalon kii gandhi ke bare main jaankaree or samaj akasar shunya hoti he
 Mahatma Gandhi remained an aggressive impost for a lifetime in a country where hippocracy is an essential value
 tarkahin lekin vakpatu log hameshaa yahaan bahulata main rahe hai
 There is a difference of day and night between our words and our actions
 naitikta kii kitabon ke almaari ke neeche sabase ghor aniatik kaam hote rahe hai
 Gandhi that does not end 
 After all, what is the need of Gandhi in this country
 unke itihaas ko baar-baar udheda or buna kyon ja rahaa he
 In fact, the more they reject Gandhi from bloodbase, the deeper they start to emerge
 lagbhag 100 saal pehle gandhi ko britain kii sarkaar ne golmes sammelan main hissaa lene landan bulaayaa
 Then Prime Minister Churchill of the UK criticized it harshly and vulgarly
 churchill ne kaha ham ek adhanange fakir ko jarurat se zyada tavajjo de rahe hai
 As the century passed, an incident took place
 saal 2015 aayaa or britain kii sarkaar ne apni sansad ke saamne churchill ke thik bagal main mahatma gandhi kii murti sthapit kii
 It takes time to develop understanding and time is strong
 gandhi aalochana se pare nahin ho sakate, hone bhi nahin chahie
 Hardly anyone has criticized Gandhi as ruthlessly
 unki aatmakatha 'satya ke saath mere prayog' padhie
 Gandhi wrote this autobiography in the days when he was given the title of Mahatma
 aaie samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki aakhir gandhi kiske agent the
 The religious and passionate people of Gandhi, the agent of religion, considered his words to be a divine voice
 is daur main gandhi ne apni aatmakatha main yah tak zikr kar diya ki apane biimaar pita ko sota chhod vah patni ke paas sambhog karne pahunch gaye
 Even after 100 years, you shudder to speak the word sex in a public place
 par gandhi ne us daur main apni aakraamak satyanishtha main is baat kaa bhi dastavejikaran kar diya
 That is, he was not the agent of that great Indian culture, where the rape of the woman is justified, but not his outspokenness
 gandhi ne vaani or karm kaa eka rakhane kii bhul kii isliye vah kisi dharm ke bhi agent nahin ho sakate
 Gandhi's decisions can also be criticized as a political thinker of the Congress agent
 gandhi bhale hi congress ke postaron par netaa ke rup main aaj bhi chaspa die jate hon lekin unhone jite ji hi congress kii sadsyta chhod di thi
 Many times openly criticized the Congress
 yahaan tak kii aazaadee ke baad yah tak kah diya tha ki ab congress ko khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 Gandhi was not a person to blindly accept the party line
 yani unhen congress kaa agent bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Gandhi, the agent of the Hindus! Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, did not like Gandhi
 unhone muslim samudaay main yah baat failaai ki gandhi hinduon ke netaa hai
 He does not think of Muslims
 jaahir he do-raashtra siddhant kii vakaalat karne vaale jinna gandhi ko hinduon kaa agent samajha karte the
 So was Gandhi an agent of Hindus
 ji nahin
 Gandhi also fails in this test of being an agent
 jab bharat ek aaazaad desh ke taur par janm le rahaa tha gandhi dilli se dur nauvwakhali main the
 In the colony of Muslims
 gandhi yahaan hindu-muslim danga rukvane akele chale aae the
 In Nauvakhali, a witness to the bloody struggle, Gandhi had shown what the entire administration was not able to do together
 gandhi ne danga rukvaa diya
 After Independence, there were reports of constant killing of Hindus from Pakistan
 kashmir par usne apane napak kadam badha die the
 Gandhi was sitting on fast unto death here
 jaanate hai yah aamaran anshan kis liye tha? pakistan ke liye
 Gandhi went on a hunger strike against the Indian government to give his outstanding money to Pakistan
 is faisle par gandhi ke saath koi nahin tha
 He was getting all round criticism
 apane siddhanton ke liye atirek tak jane ke abhyast gandhi nahin maane
 Ultimately, the Government of India accepted the demand to give Pakistan its share of the money
 is lihaaj se gandhi hinduon ke bhi agent nahin ho paae
 Now dealing with the doubts of Katju and Sadhvi, Mahatma Gandhi was a highly educated Indian
 swayan ko dharti kaa sarvshereshth praani maanane vaale angrejon ko ek aatmavishvasi kaala aadmi phooti aankh nahin suhaata tha
 Gandhi did real harm to the British
 unke ahimsak tareeke ek abhinav prayog the
 Where some unarmed people stand against a barbaric regime
 duniya kaa koi bhi insaan aisi sthiti main nihatthon se sahanubhuti rakhega
 Gandhi discounted the credibility of the British globally
 gandhi ke kaaran america dabaav bhi un par baari hone laga tha
 Gandhi uncovered his politics under which it was claimed that white people had come to civilize black people
 gandhi ne apane taur-tareekon se unka nakaab noch diya
 If you have come to Moksha Dham, then you will not have to ask anyone about the most famous dish here
 gaya ke railway stesan, bas stop, chote-bade har maarg par aapako tilkut kii kai dukaane dikh jaaengi
 Last month when i was in Gaya, Saket, an engineer friend from Bangalore, called me
 jaise hi maine unhen bataaya ki main gaya main hum to unhone tapaak se tilkut bhejne kii farmaaish kar daali
 At that time i was in a salon
 salon vaale se poocha ki tilkut kii acchhee dukaan koun-si he
 His answer was, "ramana Road was famous at first but now it has become very artisan
 isliye kahin bhi kharidenge swaad main zyada antar nahin padegaa
 "well, i went to Ramna Road
 vahaan darjanon dukaanon main tilkut banaae or beche jate hai
 Tilakut business runs throughout the year
 aakhir ramana road tilkut ke liye khaas kyon he? gaya dham tilkut sangh ke adhyaksh lalji prasad ne bataaya, "ramana market tilkut kaa avishkaarak he
 Thirty years ago most of the tilakut used to go from here
 lekin jaise-jaise karigar bade, iskaa dayera bad gaya or baahar tak fail gaya
 "sesame and sugar or jaggery are used in tilakut
 lekin donon kii acchhee quality or anupaat se swaad kaa sidhaa sambandh he
 Good tilkut gets filled with mouth
 lalji prasad ke mutabik, tilkut kii shuruyaat gud ke tilkut se hui thi
 Gur tilkut is still made at Tekari in Gaya district
 darasal, gaya ke aasapaas chini mil thi
 Initially it was made by mixing jaggery and black sesame seeds
 phir, gud kii jagah shakkar kaa istemaal kiya jane laga
 Milk, betel leaf and lemon were added to clean the sugar
 ab jab ujala til or chini uplabdh ho gaya tab nae swaroop main khova bharkar or sukha mewa daalkar tilkut banaaya jane laga
 Silav of Silav is famous for the Khajja of Nalanda, home district of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 patna-rajgir maarg par sthit silao bazaar ke kareeb 200 dukaanon main ek-chauthai dukaane khaja kii hai
 Former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad also included it in the railway menu
 yahi nahin, morishas main yojit sagar mahotsav main khaja kii saraahna kii gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also praised it
 yahaan ke dukandaar rakesh saah kehete hai ki pehle unke purvaj kaali saah kii sirf ek dukaan thi
 When its demand started increasing, shops also started increasing
 ab sirf kaali saah ke naam par darjan bhar dukaane hai
 Rakesh explained, "maida, sugar and refine oil are used to make Khaja
 sabase pehle maida ko pani main goonthte hai
 Then the dough fries the refined flour
 uske baad chaante hai
 Then put a thin molasses of sugar on top of it on a tray while salt is added at the time of kneading in the salty khaja
 ab bina chini or namak kaa khaja bhi banaae jane laga he
 "what to say about Manner's Laddu in Laddupatna district!" Now there are big shops of laddus in other cities in the name of Maner
 maner sharif khankah ke sajjadanasheen khankah makhdoom daulat ali kchawaja mohammad buniyaad firdausi ke bawarchi ko abul mujffar jilaluddin shah alam badshaah ke bawarchi ne laddu kaa nuskhaa diya tha
 Gradually this recipe became common, later it became known as Maner Laddu
 yahaan laddu banane kii shuruyaat banule ke beej se hui thi
 When this seed started falling short, then it was prepared from gram flour gram flour
 patna ke

 jaiswal shodh santhaan ke purv nideshak or bihar viraasat samiti ke sachiv dow
 Vijay Kumar Chaudhary says, "sweets like tilkut, khaja, laddu, anarsa have been the ancient sweets of Bihar
 darasal, chhathi shatabdi isa purv main hi yahaan shaharikaran ho gaya tha
 Magadha region was the most powerful district
 sambhav he, aise paramparaagat mithaiyaan vibhinn roopon main un dinon se chali aa rahi hai
 "every city has its own flavor, different kinds of sweets are made in different areas of Bihar
 maida, chini or ripine se khaja taiyaar kiye jate rahe hai
 From these ingredients, a dessert called Bara is made in Pakribarawan in Nawada district
 navada-jamui road par sthit pakaribraavaan bazaar kii bara mithai kaaphi lokapriy he
 Bara Pakar has about 50 shops in Pakribarawan
 rasmahal ke sanchaalak ravishankar prasad bataate hai, "jin samagriyon se bara taiyaar kii jaati he, unheen se lakhisarai main tikri, sherghati main piau taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 But their taste is different
 ''pakaribraavaan bara kii khaasiyat he ki yah bahut hi khasta hota he
 It is considered a good jumbo, on which even if the coin falls by mistake, it breaks
 darasal, ise banane ke liye maide main ghi or soda milakar guntha jaataa he
 It is then filtered in refine or ghee
 uske baad chini kaa halkaa shira daalaa jaataa he
 Slow heat and the ratio of ingredients matter to make it

 khanpan kaa anubhav rakhane vaale patna ke patrkaar ravi upaadhyaay kehete hai, "bihar ke log jis tarah baaki kshetron main nity nae prayog karte rahe hai, usee tarah khanpan ko lekar bhi prayog karte rahe hai
 This is the reason why even the small town has its own identity for catering
 ''misaal ke taur par, patna jile main baadh anumandal mukhyalay kaa ek chote-se market chondipar kii laai kaaphi lokapriy vyanjan he
 It is usually made from a mixture of Ramdana and sugar

 Champaran is famous for Chamuna, the land of Meatsatyagraha
 ahuna matan banane kaa tarika ekadam paramparaagat he
 It is considered quite tasty
 yahaan ke jaiswal hotel ke sanchaalak sunil jaiswal kehete hai ki pehle nepal ke garuda or katahariya main is tarah kaa matan banaaya jaataa tha
 After this, ahuna mutton started to be formed in the Ghodashan of Champaran, bordering Nepal
 uske baad yah purvi champaran main pahunchaa
 It has now become a part of the life of carnivores
 champaran main isaki 100 se adhik dukaane hai
 But this recipe was probably given the most popularity by an open outlet called Champaran Meat in Patna, where apart from ahuna mutton, other dishes of meat are also very tasty and there is an influx of eaters
 rajdhani patna ke alaava duusare rajyon main champaran kaa ahuna matan khub pasand kiya jane laga he

 But a 27-year-old boy playing from the Punjab team, playing a stormy unbeaten innings of 120 runs off 63 balls in that match, not only won his team a difficult match, but also surprised the cricket fans with his batting

 It is difficult to find a man named Paul Valthati in this country who worships cricketers like God
 aisa nahin he ki paul 2011 ke baad ipel khele nahin

 rahul haalanki pichley saal tak ipel khele
 He played for the Delhi Daredevils last year after the Pune Warriors were discharged from the IPL, but his bowling shine had vanished
 rahul kaa kariyar chaupat karne main kuch yogadan us drugs cond kaa bhi rahaa, jimasen wo south africa ke bowler vine parnell ke saath pakade gaye the or unka drugs test positive paaya gaya tha
 After that scandal, his career continued to decline and now he is almost anonymous

 It is also possible that the team management may take Vijay Shankar to number four and keep Rahul in the team as their substitute

 He will only come into the team as a back-up to the opener and not as a number four batsman

 Three medals named for Sindhu ramajaan shuru ho gaya he, chand dikhne ke baad se roje rakhane kii parampara he
 In the coming month, the Muslim community will keep fasting and worship Allah
 ramajaan ke puure maheene kuch khaas baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he
 Let us know which things should be kept in mind: 1
 insaan ramajaan kii har raat usase agle din ke roje kii niyat kar saktaa he
 It is better that on the first night of the month of Ramadan, decide the fast of the whole month
 ramajaan mubarak: saaf dil se ibaadat kaa maheenaa shuru, aasmaan se utari thi quran2
 If someone intentionally sets another fast in the month of Ramadan, other than the fast of Ramadan, then that fast will not be accepted nor will it be included in the fast of Ramadan
 3
 It is better that you buy the required items for the whole month before the month of Ramadan starts, so that you do not have to wander outside in the condition of fasting and you can spend more time in prayer
 4
 Drink more and more water after Iftar in the month of Ramadan
 dinabhar ke roje ke baad sharir main pani kii kaaphi kami ho jaati he
 2 at least men
 5 litre or auraton ko kam se kam 2 litre pani jarur pinaa chahie
 5
 iftaar kii shuruyaat halke khaane se karen
 Iftar is considered better than dates
 iftaar main pani, salad, fal, zeus or soup zyada khaaen or pien
 This will complete the lack of water in the body
 6
 Do not eat too much fried, spicy, sweet food in Sahari, because eating such food makes thirst more
 sahari main otmil, doodh, bread or fal sehat ke liye behatar hota he
 7
 ramajaan ke maheene menzyada se zyada ibaadat karen, allaah ko raji karnaa chahie kyunki is maheene main kar nek kaam kaa sawab badha diya jaataa he
 8
 ramajaan main zyada se zyada quran kii tilavat, namaaj kii pabandi, jakaat, sadaq or allaah kaa zikr karke ibaadat karen
 Iftar to Rojedars is considered to be a great job
 9
 If a person sets fast and sleeps during the time of Sahari, then sleep will be considered as a fast, but it is right
 10
 The month of Ramadan is divided into three Ashars
 pehle 10 din ko pehla ashara kehete hai jo rahamat kaa he
 The second Ashra is said to be the next 10 days which is of Magafirat and the third Ashra is said to be the last 10 days which is of Ajati from Jahannam
 11
 If a person intentionally eats something in the condition of fasting, then their fast is broken, but if someone accidentally eats something, then their fast does not break
 12
 If a sick person recovers before Zohar in the month of Ramadan and by then he has not done any work that breaks the fast, then it is necessary to keep his fast for that day
 13
 If the food stuck in daily teeth is swallowed intentionally, then its fast breaks
 14
 Swallowing mouth water does not break the fast
 agar kisi lajij khaane kii khwaahish se munh main pani aa jaae to us pani ko nigalane se rojaa nahin tuutata he
 15
 ramajaan ke maheene meninsaan buree laton se dur rahata he, cigarette kii lat chhodane ke liye ramajaan kaa maheenaa bahut acha he
 Eating cigarettes or tobacco by keeping rosa breaks the fast
 16
 In the condition of fasting, getting the teeth removed makes rosaro gooseberry, or by doing some work that starts bleeding from the mouth, it also becomes rooster
 17
 If you are wearing fully wet clothes in the condition of fasting, then your Roja can be Capricorn
 18
 Any food whose food breaks the rosa, is forcefully put into the chasm of an employee and if they swallow it, the fast does not break
 19
 If a person is forced to eat food by threatening the loss of life and property, and the person does not break the fast, if the person consumes food to avoid that loss
 20
 In the month of Ramadan, the number of grains is increased by 10 to 700 times
 nafl namaaj kaa sawab ferj ke baraabar or ferj kaa sawab 70 ferj ke baraabar ho jaataa he
 21
 ramajaan ke maheene main allaah apane bandon par khaas karam farmaata he or uski har jaij dua ko kubul karata he
 In Ramadan the doors of paradise are opened and the doors of Jahnum are closed
 22
 After Namaz in Ramadan, make a habit of reciting the Quran Pak, it is a matter of great importance
 ramajaan main kuch vakt nikaalkar quran-e-majid ko sunen, kyunki ramajaan kaa lamhaa-lamhaa ibaadat or sawab kaa he
 23
 ramajaan ke maheene main koshish karen ki aap har vakt ba-vaju rahen
 Get into the habit of sleeping early at night so that you can get up for prayer prayers
 maah-e-ramajaan: rahamaton or barkaton kaa maheenaa24
 Before going to bed every night, think about the amalas you have made
 apane nek aamaal par allaah kaa shukr adaa kiijie or apni galatiyon or kotaahiyon ke liye allaah se maafee maangiye or tauba kiijie
 25
 ramajaan ke maheene main rojaanaa saddaka karne kii aadat daalen, chaahe thodaa hi kyun naa ho
 Make it a part of your everyday life
 26
 Do the Naafl prayers in Ramadan like the prayers of Tahajud, it is very good
 zyada se zyada vakt quran or hadith, phikah or islamic kitabon ke mutale main guzaaren
 27
 kisi aise aadmi ko iftaar kii daavat den jo aapkaa jaankaar ho, aap mahasoos karenge ki aapke rishte or bhi majboot ho gaye hai
 Try to have all the people in the house together iftar together
 28
 In Ramadan, give up all your bad habits and use this ba-barkat month in noble deeds
 ramajaan main apane padosiyon ko hameshaa yaad rakhen or unka khyaal rakhen

 dilli ke nae siem arvind kejariwal ne apni yojanaon ko amalijama pehanaanaa shuru kar diya he
 Kejriwal wants to take big decisions on issues related to public interest without losing time
 yahi vajah he ki unhone siem kii kursi sanbhaalane ke agle hi din ravivaar ko janata darbar lagaaya
 As before, Arvind Kejriwal came out of his house in Kaushambi and accepted the greetings of the public
 unhone aam logon kii samasyaayein suni, phir use sulajhane ke liye thos kadam uthaane kii baat kahi
 He said that a week, ten days is enough time to settle himself
 10 dinon ke bheetar dilli main bada badlaav aayega
 Now that he himself is at the helm of power in Delhi, there is no possibility of any hindrance in administrative work
 siem kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke paas janata se kiye vaade puraa karne ke liye kitna vakt he, yah thik-thik kisi ko nahin maaloom he
 The biggest 'pandit' of politics must have felt helpless in speculating on this
 tabhi to kejariwal mantrimandal sab-kuch tej raftaar se nipataata najar aa rahaa he
 On the very first day of becoming the Chief Minister, Kejriwal hinted at ending the VIP culture in Delhi
 sachivalay kii sabhi gadiyon se 'laal batti' utarava lee gai
 He refused to take security for his ministers and legislators
 9 iees afasaron ko 'idhar se udhar' kar diya gaya

 bharat or england ke bich khele ja rahe duusare test match main bharat ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla liya he
 In this match, Team India is going on the field with two changes
 salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir kii jagah ke
 l Rahul has been included in the team
 iske alaava amit mishra kii jagah yuva spin gendbaaj jayant yadav ko plaing ilevan main jagah mili he
 Yadav's debut is a test match
 unhone newjiland ke khilaaf vanade muqablon main shandaar pradarshan kiya tha
 There was a draw in the first Test match played between the two teams in Rajkot
 spin gendbaajon par rahegi najardusre test main behatar pradarshan karne ke iraade se utrenge kyonki pich ko spinneron ke anukool mana ja rahaa he
 The pitch of the ACA-VDCA stadium is considered to be completely spin-friendly, in front of which the team will be tested for batting
 bhartiya captain viraat kohli isse pehle rajkot kii pich ko lekar nakhushi jataa chuke hai jahaan bhartiya spinneron ko sirf nau wicket mili jabaki england ke ballebaajon ne chaar shatak jade
 Ravichandran Ashwin's ability to get wickets on a good pitch after the Rajkot match is also being questioned, who managed to get just three wickets despite spending 230 runs in the first Test
 rahul he pehali pasandpahle test main kharaab pradarshan ke baad anbhavi salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir kaa test kariyar lagbhag khatm ho gaya he kyonki captain kohli ne spasht kar diya he ki team main vaapasi karne vaale lokesh rahul salaami ballebaaji ke rup main pehali pasand hai
 Kohli said that it is clear in our mind that Lokesh is our first choice with Murali Vijay, he will return to the team whenever he is fit and we will start with him
 chaahe iske liye use pratham shrenee match ke bich se hataanaa pade, yah niyamon ke anusaar he
 In the second Test, the spinners will remain strong and in such a situation, it will have to be seen whether Kohli comes with an extra batsman in the playing XI or prefers the all-rounder
 pehle test main kai kaich tapakaane ke baad bhartiya team kshetrarakshan main bhi sudhaar karnaa chaahegi
 India will be eyeing the spinners but the strategy under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni was overshadowed by the hosts four years ago when England won the series 2–1 after losing the first Test in Ahmedabad
 do hafte pehle bangladesh main mejabaan team ke khilaaf pehali shikast ke baad mana ja rahaa tha ki england kii team ke khilaaf bharat acha pradarshan karegaa
 Despite the draw at Rajkot, four of England's batsmen scored centuries while their spinners also took 13 wickets more than their Indian counterparts
 england ke captain cook kii aguai vaali team ne sabit kar diya he ki unki team newjiland se kahin behatar he jise bharat ne pichhali shrinkhalaa main 3-0 se haraaya tha
 With England's superior performance, it has been proved that India's path will not be easy
 rajkot main aswin, ravindra jadeja or amit mishra kii bhartiya tikdi se zyada prabhavi moin ali, jafar ansaari or adil raashid kii england kii spin tikdi rahi jiske baad bhartiya anil kumble ne bhi apane spinneron kaa bachaav kiya
 In the second Test, India will be eyeing Ashwin, Jadeja and Mishra would also like to do better
 mishra us pich par behatar pradarshan kii ummid kar rahe honge jahaan do hafte pehle newjiland ke khilaaf antim vanade main unhone 18 ran dekar paanch wicket chatkaaye the or mehmaan team ko 23
 Was instrumental in piling up 79 for 1 over
 rahane, pujaara ko leni hogi jimmedaaribharat ko haalanki paanch gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii ranneeti par bhi gaur karnaa hoga kyonki aisi sthiti main kohli yaa ajinkya rahane jab bhi vifal rahete hai to bhartiya ballebaaji main khatre main aa jaati he
 Cheteshwar Pujara or Rahane will have to take responsibility with Kohli
 gambhir ko vaapasi karaane kaa prayog ummid ke mutabik nattejey nahin de paaya
 He was able to play 29 and zero innings in the last match, which led to Rahul being called from the middle of the Ranji Trophy match
 angrejon ko milegaa sakalen kaa sathaspin vibhaag main england ko kamjor nahin aanka ja saktaa
 The team has also extended the contract of Pakistan's legendary spinner, Sakleen Mushtaq, who is associated with the team as a spin bowling consultant, Saklein was to return after the first Test but will remain with the team till the Mohali Test

 Swamy, who often created controversy over his comments, said, "I don't know why our Prime Minister keeps saying that the fifth biggest
" 
 
 kyonki unhen arthshaastra kii jaankaree nahin he or vitt mantri bhi arthshaastra nahin jaanate
 Swamy, who holds a phd in economics from Harvard and teaches there, has often criticized Jaitley
 swami ne kaha ki vinimay daron par aadhaarit gananaa ke anusaar bhartiya arthvyavastha vishwa main paanchaven sthaan par he
 He said that as exchange rates keep changing and the rupee depreciating, India is currently the seventh largest economy based on such calculations

 Akhilesh Yadav has given a big statement about the Congress' position in the Grand Alliance before the Lok Sabha elections (loksabhaelection2019) in Uttar Pradesh
 lakhanu main purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki congress pehle bhi hamaare saath thi or abhi bhi hamaare saath hi he
 In such a situation, there is no question of the Congress separating from us
 unhone patrakaron ke sawaal par kaha ki aap yah baar-baar kyon poochhate hai ki congress saath aegi yaa nahin? main aapse ek baar phir spasht kar dena chahta hum ki congress hamaare saath he, vah gathbandhan kaa hissaa he
 In the Lok Sabha elections this time, the Congress will contest two seats while remaining in the alliance
 akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) ne areldi kii siton kaa bhi elaan kiya
 Akhilesh Yadav: Congress is with us, it is a part of our alliance
 Why do you(media) repeatedly ask if Congress will come with us or not? i have said before also that Congress is part of Mahagatbandhan, they will contest on 2 seats in our alliance pic

 com / rtdexxwo5bakilesa yadav ne sahyogi party areldi ko lekar bhi tippanee kii
 He said that we are giving three seats to RLD in this election
 is elaan ke baad areldi ke netaa jayant choudhary ne kaha ki RLD uttar pradesh main teen loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladegi
 He said that the RLD would join the BSP-SP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 hamaare kaaryakarta athak parishram karenge, taaki rajya kii har seat par gathbandhan kii jeet sunishchit ho sake

 At that time, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati had said in a joint press conference that we feel that they will lose seats due to alliance with Congress
 buaa-babua kii jodi ne mahagathbandhan kii kavayadon main juty congress ko na sirf jhatka diya tha
 However, this new alliance announced not to field its candidates in both the traditional seats of Congress
 mayawati or akhilesh yadav ne saajha press conference main elaan kiya tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main sapa or basapa 38-38 siton par ladegi
 The SP-BSP alliance has left four seats, of which two seats will go to the allies' account, two seats have been left for Congress, Amethi and Rae Bareli
 saajha press conference ke dauraan mayawati ne bijepi or congress donon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 On not keeping the Congress with the SP-BSP alliance, Mayawati had said that the Congress policies are corrupt like the BJP
 bijepi or congress donon ke shasankaal main bhrashtachar hue
 The policy of both the Congress and the BJP is equally corrupt and the BSP loses its vote share if it goes with the Congress
 sapa-basapa ko congress ke saath jane se koi khaas phayda hone vaala nahin he
 We have preferred our experience
 congress kaa saath jane se hamaare vot share par bura asar padataa he
 If we do not go with them, then we have more vote share
 lihaaja hamanen is vajah se congress ko gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa he
 However, our party has decided that the entire country will not contest elections in alliance with Congress party or any other such party, so that our vote is cut
 unhone kaha tha kiaj bijepi ke shasankaal main aghoshit immergency lagi hui he
 This time the BJP is going to suffer a big loss, like the elections held in 1977
 mayawati ne kaha tha ki boforce kii vajah se congress kii sarkaar gai thi, ab rafel kii vajah se bijepi kii sarkaar jaaegi
 Rafael will sink BJP mayawati ne kaha tha ki bijepi ne pradesh main beyimaani se satta hasil kii he
 We did not put Congress in the coalition
 congress yaa bijepi koi aae, donon main ek hi baat he
 The policies of Congress and BJP are the same
 donon sarkaron kaa haal ek jes hi rahe hai
 If we ally with Congress, we will incur losses
 kyonki congress ke samay main bhi bhrashtachar hua
 Mayawati had said that the BJP has formed a dishonest government in UP
 janvirohi ko satta main aane se rokenge
 People are upset with bjp's arrogant government
 jaise hamane milakar upachunaavon main bijepi ko haraaya he, usee tarah ham loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko haraayenge

 However, Union Minister Alphons Kannanthanam has said that the Disaster Management Act 2005 does not have a provision to declare a disaster as a national disaster
 aaie jaanate hai ki rashtriya aapadaa orgambhir aapadaamen kya antar hota he
 Definition of Disaster According to the Disaster Management Act, 2005, 'disaster' means any catastrophe, destruction, destruction, etc
 caused by natural or anthropogenic reasons in any area, or due to accident or neglect, which results in huge loss of human life or property
 Causing heavy damage and destruction, or extensive damage to the environment and to be so large that it is not possible for the local community to deal with
 prakritik or maanav janit aapadabukamp, baadh, bhuskhalan, chakravaat, tsunami, shahari ilaakon main baadh, lu aadi ko 'prakritik aapadaa' mana jaataa he, jabaki newclear, biological or chemical aapadaaon ko 'maanav janit aapadaa' mana jaataa he
 How to decide National disaster: There is no government or legal provision to consider any disaster as a national disaster
 haal hi main sansad ke monsoon satr main grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju ne kaha tha, 'state dizaster respance fund (SDRF) yaa neshnal dizaster respance fund (NDRF) kii maujuuda guideline iske bare main nahin bataati ki kis aapadaa ko 'rashtriya aapadaa' ghoshit kiya jaae
 'the answer to many questions is not decided
 The proposal came up for consideration before the Fifth Finance Commission (1995-2000) that a disaster can be declared a' national disaster of extraordinary intensity 'if it affects one-third of the state's population
 You do ayog ne ise sweekaar to kiya, lekin yah tay nahin kiya ki 'asaadhaaran prachandta kii aapadaa' kise kahenge
 But the commission said that it would depend on case to case, that is, it can be decided according to individual cases
 uttarakhand main badal fatne se ai baadh or chakravaat hudahud kois tarah kii aapadaghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Which fund in which disaster? According to the National Disaster Management Policy, the state government has to provide relief from the State Disaster Response Fund
 agar gambhir prakruti kii aapadaa hoti he to hi neshnal dizaster rispons fund (andiaref) se madad uplabdh karai jaati he
 If declared a 'national calamity of extraordinary intensity', the state government gets support from the national level

 After 14 months in Karnataka, the congress-jds government led by HD Kumaraswamy has finally collapsed
 ek baar phir se bijepi ke satta main aane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 After bjp's return to power in Karnataka, the focus is now on the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh
 bijepi ne 'oparation lotus' ke jariye madhya pradesh main kuch bada ulatpher karne kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 The Kumaraswamy government failed to pass the floor test in the majority test held on Tuesday after a political uproar in Karnataka for the past several days
 kumaraswami sarkaar ke paksh main 99 vot or bijepi ke paksh main 105 vot pade
 Thus Kumaraswamy lost power
 karnataka ke baad ab bijepi kii najar madhya pradesh main satta vaapasi par he
 In such a situation, the difficulties of Congress 'lotus' can now increase
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne kaha ki madhya pradesh main jald hi sarkaar apana pindadaan karavaaegi
 At the same time, the Congress leader has clearly stated that the BJP will have to take seven births to do horse trading with this government in Madhya Pradesh
 karnataka main kumaraswami kii sarkaar girane ke baad gopal bhargav ne pratikriya dete hue kaha ki langadi sarkaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Bhargava also compared Karnataka with Madhya Pradesh, saying that Madhya Pradesh has almost the same situation, because the transfer industry which is going on here, fraudulently cheated the farmers and took votes from them
 mujhe vishwaas he madhya pradesh kii sarkaar bhi apana pindadaan karavaaegi
 Explain that even after bjp's victory in the Lok Sabha elections, Gopal Bhargava had demanded the Governor to call the assembly session at the earliest, so that the floor test could be conducted in the Modi wave
 vahiin, madhya pradesh ke mantri or congress netaa jitu patawaari ne kaha ki 'karnataka main jo hua vaisaa madhya pradesh main nahin hoga
 BJP did everything to create problems for us, but it is Kamal Nath's government and not Kumaraswamy
 unhen madhya pradesh sarkaar main horse trading karne ke liye saat janm lene honge
 After Karnataka, now in the midst of a political discussion about Madhya Pradesh, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said, 'we will not cause the fall of the (madhya Pradesh) government here
 congress ke netaa swayan apni sarkaron ke patan ke liye jimmedaar hai
 There is an internal conflict in the Congress, and the BSP-SP has support, if something happens, we cannot do anything
 'madhya pradesh kaa siyaasi sameekarnabta den ki 2018 main hue madhya pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila tha
 Out of 230 assembly seats in the state, Congress emerged as the single largest party by winning 114 seats
 haalanki, bahumat ke liye 116 vidhayakon kii avashyaktaa hoti he
 In this way, Congress has two mlas less than majority
 kamalnath ne basapa, sapa or nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan se sarkaar banaai hui he
 There are 4 independent mlas in the assembly
 2 vidhayak basapa se hai or ek vidhayak samaajawaadee party se he
 BJP not far behind the Congress, if you look at the figures in Madhya Pradesh, BJP is not far behind the Congress in terms of number of mlas
 bijepi ke paas 109 vidhayak the, lekin haal hi main ratlam-jhabua seat se saansad banane ke baad sthaneey bijepi vidhayak ne vidhansabha se istipha de diya jiske baad ab bijepi ke paas 108 vidhayak bache hai
 In such a situation, if the operation of Lotus would have been done in Madhya Pradesh on the lines of Karnataka, then the difficulties of Kamal Nath government may increase
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne srilanka ke haathon buudhvaar ko trikoniya ek divasiy cricket shrinkhalaa ke final main khitaab ganvaane ke baad kaha ki agar 20 ran or bane hote to ham match jeet sakate the, lekin team ko ashish nehra kii bhi kaaphi kami khali
 Dhoni also expressed disappointment over the poor performance of the batsmen, but he felt that the absence of Nehra made it even more difficult to save the 246-run target
 dhoni ne match ke baad patrakaron se kaha, match ke shuru main paanch wicket ganvaa dena kaaphi ahm hota he
 Our score was 20-30 runs short
 ashish nehra kii anupasthiti ne ise or mushkil bana diya
 There was no dew and the fast bowlers could have benefited from it and if it had been there, perhaps the situation could have been different
 unhone kaha, balki ham is lakshya ko bachaane kii ore bad rahe the kyonki os nahin thi
 The spinners were also gaining grip and there was plenty for the fast bowlers as well
 agar hamane 20-30 ran or bana liye hote or nehra chotil nahin hota to hamaare paas jeet kaa mauka hota
 He was 1 by the time Nehra was taken off the field
 2 over daal chuke the or unhone upul thanrga kaa wicket bhi hasil kar liya tha
 But he had to go off the field due to a groin injury
 dhoni ne gendbaajon kii behatar pradarshan karne ke liye tarif bhi kii, lekin unhone ballebaajon ko aade haathon liya
 He said, the batsmen played bad shots, due to which we had to suffer
 is tarah ke uchhalbhre wicket par sanbhalkar ballebaaji kerani chaiye thi
 He thanked Suresh Raina (106) and Ravinder Jadeja (38), who made a 106-run standoff, saying both of them played sensibly and brought us to a respectable score
 lekin maine pari ke baad raina se kaha ki use aakhir tak tike rahanaa chaiye tha
 We should have scored 20 more runs

 Therefore, the industry is expecting a rate cut on many items in the GST Council meeting on 20 September
 haalanki ajtak ne jiesti council baithak ke agenda ko dekha he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki un sector main rate katautee par vichaar kiya jaae jinamein maang or bikri main giravat kii vajah se kaaphi pareshaani chal rahi he
 Industries like Biscuit, Hotel can get relief, but the auto sector is finding it difficult to get relief
 shuukravaar ko hone vaali jiesti council kii baithak main automobile, biscuit, maachis, outdoor cataring segment ke jiesti rate main badlaav kii baat agenda main rakhi gai he
 But from the information that the council sources are giving, it does not seem that the GST rate of all these sectors will be cut
 mandi se halkaan chal rahe auto sector ke log kaaron par jiesti 28 se ghataakar 18 fisadi karne kii ummid kar rahe hai
 People in the industry say that the meeting of the GST Council is taking place at a critical time when the festive season is coming up in the next few weeks and they will have to make attractive offers to the customers to sell the vehicles
 aise main agar jiesti rate main katautee hoti he to is sector ke maang ko teji mil sakegi
 Opposition to GST cut in auto, however many states like Kerala are opposing the GST rate cut in autos
 jiesti council kii fitment cameti ne is par vichaar kiya he ki auto sector main rate katautee kaa kya asar hoga or uskaa yah maananaa he ki auto sector main rate katautee se jiesti sangrah ko tagdi chot lagegi, kyonki is sector se salanaa 50 se 60 hajaar karod rupee kaa jiesti sangrah hota he
 Relief possible for a short time! Sources say that the government's decision in this matter will be political
 sutron kaa kahana he ki agar bahut hua to kuch samay ke liye auto sector ko jiesti daron main raahat di ja sakati he
 He claims that if the government announces a rate cut by the end of this financial year, then prices will have to rise again, because the expenditure on new technology will increase significantly by following the BS VI standard
 to keemton main teji se hone vaali badhat kii vajah se rate main katautee ke baavjood yah sector sankat se baahar nahin nikal paaegaa
 That's why auto companies are seeking long-term trust from the government
 auto companiyaan kam ingine kshamta vaale dopahiyaa vaahanon par bhi tex ghataane kii maang kar rahi hai
 The hotel industry may get relief although the hotel industry may get good news
 abhi 7500 rupee prati nite ste se zyada charge karne vaale lagjri hotel par 28 fisadi kaa jiesti lagata he, lekin jiesti council se inhen raahat mil sakati he
 According to sources, in view of PM Modi's call to promote tourism, the GST rate can be reduced to 18 per cent for hotels charging Rs 10 to 12 thousand per night stay
 isi tarah outdoor catarrs par abhi 18 fisadi tex lagata he, lekin unhen bhi raahat mil sakati he
 Similarly, the match industry is also facing a lot of difficulty with two types of GST rates and the council can give some relief to it
 jiesti concil ke liye mushkil yah bhi he ki jiesti collection 1 lakh karod rupee ke lakshya se kam hua he
 In such a situation, it also has to take measures to increase the tax collection on some items by increasing the rate

 Shahrukh Khan made a simple statement that we tolerate social media on all fronts

 BJP MP Yogi Adityanath compared Shahrukh to terrorist Hafiz Saeed, while BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya termed Shahrukh's statement as 'treason' via Twitter

 The Supreme Court said that we want to make it clear that what the respondent has said to the Supreme Court is wrong

 supreme court ne kaha ki media yaa janata ke samaksh raajnneetik bhaashan yaa bayaanbaji main court ke hawaale se koi bhi vichaar, tippanee yaa finding nahin di jaani chahie jab tak ki vah court dwaara ricard na kii gai hon
 Meenakshi Lekhi has said in her petition that the Supreme Court during the hearing of the reconsideration petition in the Rafale case had rejected the Centre's initial objection that it would consider the defense document printed in The Hindu, but Congress President Rahul Gandhi told the Supreme Court Referring to the statement, the Supreme Court has also accepted that the 'watchman is a thief'

 In Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir, the terrorists attacked the army's bullet-proof car on Saturday morning

 Earlier, the central government had announced that the government would not run operations against the terrorists during the month of Ramadan, but the terrorists turned down the government, after which the terrorist activities have continued continuously

 It is worth noting that in an all-party meeting in Kashmir, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti had placed a demand in front of the Center that India should consider a unilateral ceasefire from the beginning of Ramadan till the completion of the Amarnath Yatra in August
 
 He had said that the ceasefire will help people in providing relief and a better environment in the state

 Responding sharply to Lalu Prasad, he asked who broke the dreams of Shri Krishna ji, was the Barauni fertilizer factory not closed during the Congress and RJD rule? Haven't Eyelash Bijali closed? Today Narendra Modi's government is working to revive the factory which is closed in Bihar tomorrow

 Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) descended for Damage Control after the ever-growing anger and nationwide protests against the murder of gang-raped gangs and an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir
 vah bhi isliye ki rajya main mahabuuba mufti ke netritv vaali piples democratic party (pidipi) ke saath uskaa lagaataar asthir hota gathjod kisi tarah se batch jaae
 On the 14th of April, Ram Madhav, General Secretary in charge of BJP for Jammu and Kashmir reached Jammu
 ve vahaan un do bhaajapa mantriyon choudhary laal singh or chander prakaash ganga ko hataane ke hikeman ke nirdesh kii taamil karwaane aae the, jinhone maasoom bacchee ke khilaaf bhayaavah hinsa ke aaropee logon ke liye kathith taur par samarthan jaahir kiya tha
 It was evident that Madhav was not happy with his removal
 unke istife srinagar main mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ko bhijwane ke baad madhav ne daawa kiya ki unke mantri nirdosh the or agar unka koi dosha tha bhi to vah keval unki asaavadhaanee thi
 According to Madhav, Ganga and Lal Singh had attended the rally of Hindu Ekta Manch in Kathua on March 2 only to clear the misconceptions of the people about the police investigation and they were merely assuring people that any innocent Will not be punished
 madhav ne anichhaapurna rajnatik samjhaute kaa sanket bhi de diya, ‘‘hamane na keval jammu or kashmir balki samooche desh ke logon ke jehan main vyaapt bhrantiyon or bhay ko dur karne kii apni taraf se bharsak koshish kii he
 "but he also stressed that the leadership has not taken any decision under any pressure," "no one can direct us to any agenda
" ham donon hi baraabar ke or jimmedaar sahyogi hai
 In an effort to minimize the possibility of the party's stance of any adverse effect on the party's support in Jammu region, it was later revealed (on 17 April) that Madhav had paved the way for a reshuffle in the BJP
 Has secured the resignation of all ten ministers
 haalanki vishleshkon kaa yahi maananaa tha ki yah kadam mahaj ek rajnatik chaal he, yah dikhaane ke liye jammu-kashmir main bhaajapa pidipi ke niyantran se baahar kaam karti he
 Meanwhile, Mehbooba, in Srinagar, took a more principled path, thanking the country's political leadership, the judiciary, the media and civil society for their stand in ensuring justice in the Kathua case
 pidipi ke mantri or pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne gathbandhan sarkaar ko kisi tarah ke khatre se saaf inkaar kiya or kaha ki mantriyon ke istife ‘‘vishwaas ko majboot karne vaala ek pramukh kadam he or isse (pidipi-bhaajapa) gathjod majboot hoga
 However, this peace seems weak in both the constituents
 mahabuuba or anya pidipi netaaon dwaara uthaae gaye muddon par madhav or dilli main baithe unki party ke aalaa netaaon ne kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 Especially on the statement of the Chief Minister's brother and the state's Tourism Minister Tasadduk Mufti, who in an interview to The Indian Express on 12 April gave a clear indication of a rift in the ruling coalition
 unhone kaha, ‘‘hamen (pidipi or bhaajapa ko) is jagah (jackvamu or kashmir) ko phir se khadaa karne main bhagidaar hona tha
 But instead we have become a partner in crime, which an entire generation of Kashmiris may have to pay with their blood
 ’’koi hairat kii baat nahin ki us samay jammu main maujuud madhav ne is par koi pratikriya karne se inkaar kar diya or ise ‘‘baaki sab bayaanbaji he jise ham rojaanaa sun rahe hai’’, kahkar khaarij kar diya
 He said that we will "wait for the PDP to clear its stand and show it to the BJP leadership in Delhi
 ’’udhar, rajdhani dilli main bhi 16 april ko kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh vyavhaar main kuch kam ruukhe najar aae
 He described the Kathua incident as "extremely tragic, unfortunate and shameful"
 ’’ unhone ghati main kharaab hoti suraksha kii sthiti kii baat bhi maani or behad kamjor andaaj main hi sahi, is baat ko phir se doharaaya ki ‘‘ve baatcheet ke icchhuk kisi bhi paksh se vaarta karne ko taiyaar hai
 Regarding Mehbooba's request to initiate talks with Pakistan, Rajnath Singh stressed that "there has been no dearth of efforts from our side
" ab yah pakistan ko samajhnaa he ki aatankwaad or baatcheet saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 "except for a low voice, it was no different from what Madhav had said in February," Mehboobji may have his own point of view, as she believes that if the two governments (india and Pakistan) are interchangeable
 If we talk, there may be a slight decrease in violence
 lekin is bare main gathjod koi nirnay nahin le saktaa
 Its scope is limited to the issues of the state only
 ’’april kii 13 taarikh ko yani ganga or laal singh ko hataae jane se ek din pehle pradhanmantri modi ko aakhirkaar kathua or unnav (jahaan uttar pradesh ke bhaajapa vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ek naaballig ladki se balaatkaar ke aaropee hai) par badhate logon ke gusse or kshobh par pratikriya jaahir kerani padi
 At a public function in Delhi, Modi said, "the events which have been in discussion for the last two days do not suit civil society
" ek samaaj ke rup main, ek desh ke rup main ham sab inke liye sharmasaar hai
 No criminal will survive and justice will be done and accomplished
 in betiyon ko nyaay milakar rahegaa
 We all have to deal with this crisis together
 kisi bhi doshi ko bakhsha nahin jayega or doshiyon ko sajaa dilaane main bharat sarkaar koi kotahi nahin hone degi
 "interestingly, Modi did not take the name of Kathua or Unnao in his entire talk
" kai vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki pradhanmantri ke shabd maraham kii tarah or nape-tule the taaki uskaa koi bhi sira kahin se bhi jammu or kathua main narebaaji karte vakeelon jaise ‘unmaadi kattarpathiyon’ se na jude, jinka bhagava ranneeti par, khaskar agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa ke chunaavon ke maddenjar atyadhik prabhaav he
 Then the question arises that who has been consistently rejecting Mehbooba's arguments of implementing the agenda of BJP alliance, talks with Pakistan and Hurriyat separatists, how did she become so easily ready to remove her two ministers? Analysts believe There has never been any real threat to the BJP-PDP alliance in Jammu and Kashmir
 rajya main kaam kar chuke ek purv naukarshah kehete hai, ‘‘abhi sarkaar kaa lagbhag teen saal kaa kaarykaal bachaa he or pidipi yaa bhaajapa main se koi bhi gathbandhan ko toduya nahin chahega
 "mehbooba has consistently been seen keeping the PDP away from the BJP and that is why many believe that Mehbooba can break the alliance anytime
" lekin philhal aisa nahin hoga
 Whereas, the PDP does not want to leave the power of power so soon and the BJP does not want such an endless period of governor's rule in which there is no possibility of holding fresh elections recently

 gwalior main airport nirmaan main eeai ko bhi khaasi dilchaspee thi kyonki vah dilli main badhate air trephic ko kam karne ke liye pehle se vikalp kii khoj main tha
 Availability of large land, short distance of Delhi by road and rail route favored Gwalior
 is saal sitambar maah main eeai ke adhikariyon ne airport ke liye prastaavit counter magnet city ke duganawali ilaake kii jameen kaa survey kiya to pataa chalaa ki is par to thal sena daawa jataa rahi he
 The army claims to have owned the land since 1992
 jabaki sthaneey prashasan ke mutabik 2000 main usne yah jameen sada ko counter magnet city banane ke liye di thi
 At present, the Army has filed a review petition in the Collector Court in this case
 eeai jameen vivaad main nahin padana chahta tha isliye usne duganawali kii jagah counter magnet city kii hi kuleith grram kii jameen ko chunaa
 AAI Executive Director d
 pi
 Singh says, "the land of Kulath is favorable for the airport in terms of weather and wind
" '';eeai ko kuleith kii jameen or bhi upyukt isliye lagi kyonki yahaan maujuud 4000 meter lambey or 600 meter chaude ek ytaakar hisse kaa ranve ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 But the problem with this land spread over 300 hectares is that there is forest on 86 hectares of land and permission of forest department will have to be taken for any kind of construction
 sada ke adhyaksh jai singh kushavaah aashaa jataate hai , ''van vibhaag jameen dene ke liye raji ho jayega agar rajya sarkaar badale main use duusari jameen dene ko taiyaar ho
 '' But this is not so easy
 ilaake ke kai project van vibhaag kii anumati nahin milane ke kaaran atake hue hai
 The biggest example of this is the guna-etawah rail line, which started construction two decades ago and could not be completed till date due to intervention of forest department
 jameen milane ke baad kii raah bhi aasaan nahin hogi
 AAI will have to obtain a No Objection Certificate from the Union Ministry of Aviation, Ministry of Home Affairs, Meteorological Department, DGCA and Air Force
 yah tay karne main bhi vakt lagegaa ki airport pipipi model par banegaa yaa bioti model par
 However, it is clear that Gwalior's dream of "apna Airport" will not be realized soon
 satish upaadhyaay bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii dilli ikai ke nae adhyaksh honge

 Harshavardhan resigned from the post after being elected as an MP from Chandni Chowk and became Union Minister
 rajnath ne apane maujuuda adhyaksh kaarykaal ke sambhavat: aakhri din yah faisla liya he
 It is believed that Amit Shah's name will be announced as the party's national president on Wednesday
 lambey vivaad ke baad shuukravaar yani 1 november bollywood actor sanni singh kii film ujadaa chaman relies ho gai
 Now talking about the first day collection in the film, it has not been able to do anything special
 film kii shuruyaat thodi sust hui he
 According to the Bollywood box office, the film Ujra Chamanne Day 1
 75 karod kii kamai kii he
 In contrast, the producers of the film were anticipating it to be a hit, but after earning so much, the film is not seen to be a hit
 aage agar film teji se kamai karti hai, to paisa vasuul jarur sabit hogi
 Because the production budget of the film was 7 crores

 brajeshmaheshwaria post shared bysunnysingh ੴ(@mesunnysingh) onnov 2, 2019 at 3:35am pdtpilma ujadaa chaman ko 'bala' ke baad relies hona tha, lekin donon filmon kaa concept ek jaisaa hone ke kaaran ye maamla court tak pahunch gaya tha
 The film Ujra Chaman was released after a long controversy
 bala kii kahani chori karne ke aarope main bole diarector'ujadaa chaman' kii nirmaataaon ne film bala par kahani chori karne kaa aarope laga, lekin film ke prodyur dinesh vijan ne kabhi kuch nahin bolaa
 Now Dinesh Vision has broken his silence
 dinesh ne kaha, mujhe apni film par puraa vishwaas he or isaki kahani puri tarah asli he, isliye iskaa faisla darshakon par chhod dena chahie
 Vision said while talking to news agency IANS, i am still listening to the noise so far nobody has said anything, because i have full faith in my film
 ek hafte main hamaari film relies hogi or iskaa faisla janata karegi
 Sometimes, it is good to be silent
 coment karke, main logon se film dekhne ke liye nahin kahana chahta
 It is a good story and i have full faith in the film
 kejariwal sarkaar ne dilli main ek saal tak sharaab kii nai dukaanon ko license nahin dene ke faisle par sawaal khadaa kiya he
 Prashant Bhushan, the founder of Swaraj Abhiyan and a former ally of Kejriwal, said that the ban is on till the Punjab elections
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha he ki ye pabandi sirf ek saal ke liye kyon? kyonki punjab main agle saal chunaav he
 Where AAP and Kejriwal are competing in Punjab against drug addiction and distributing liquor contracts in Delhi
 jabaswaraj abhiyaanne mudda uthaaya to unhen laga ke punjab main iskaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he isliye kejariwal ne ise sirf ek saal ke liye bain kiya taaki punjab chunaav ke baad phir theke die ja sake
 Prashant Bhushan asked why the consumption of liquor in Delhi has increased or decreased in the last year, why it was not announced at the time of coming to power
 pehle saal bhar daaru ke nae theke kyon khole gaye
 Thought no one would know
 is saal bhi sharaab niti april main ghoshit honi thi, ab tak sarkaar kya kar rahi he
 Why was there no talk of new contracts or mohalla sabha in the government draft until two weeks ago
 pichley das din main sarkaar kaa hriday parivartan kyon ho gaya
 Was this the effect of the Swaraj campaign's busted campaign
 saath hi dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ko punjab chunaav kaa dar tha
 New Delhi: Say Hussain Fakir Sai Da, Ik teri bana mukhiyan, my saheba, my love, i am yours
 
 
 
 Like Punjabi, who wrote a great hymn, Sahitya Akademi organized a symposium titled 'kahe Hussain Fakir Sai Da: Shah Hussain' in memory of Urdu Sufi saint Darvesh Shah Hussain in Punjab's Ravindra Bhavan auditorium, in which Punjab and Delhi And many veteran writers who have worked on Sufi saints as well as Urdu participated

 He said that India is the land of Sufi saints and devout poets
 academy ko mahaan sufi sant darvesh shah hossain par kendrit yah parisamvaad yojit karne par santosh kaa anubhav ho rahaa he
 Also because when the whole world is plagued with hatred, terror and hyperphilism, only the works of Sufi saints like Darvesh Shah Hussain can bring us on the path of love, harmony and satisfaction
 raav ne kaha ki shah hossain akbar or jahangir ke samakaleen the
 Shah Hussain had very good relations with Guru Arjun Dev Ji and Chhajju Bhakta
 punjabi main ek vishesh kavy-prakaar he- 'kaaphi'
 Darvesh Shah Hussain is also considered to be its initiator
 unki rachana main antarman kii lay or aadhyatm kaa ras he
 The secretary of the academy said that Shah Hussain's convictions have a very high sense of philosophical love, which is filled with fervent desire to meet his adorable by breaking all religions, creeds, castes and every bond
 yahi bhaavana he jo manushya ko uski sthiti se ooncha uthaa detii he or vah pranimaatr se prem karne lagata he
 By the time of his death, Shah Hussain used to keep awakening love in everyone's mind
 sahitya academy ke punjabi paraamarsh mandal kii sanyojak tathaa prakhyat kavyitri vanita ne apane aarambhik vaktavy main shah hossain kii punjabi sahitya main adwitiya sthiti kaa parichay diya or unki 'kaaphi' kii visheshtaon par prakaash daalaa
 He said that the convoys of Punjabi Sufi saint Shah Hussain incorporated Punjab's culture, music, language and civilization due to which it has settled in the heart of every Punjabi
 shah hossain ke aadhyatmik vyaktitv or unki saamaajik vyapti par prakaash daalate hue punjabi sahitya academy ludhiana ke adhyaksh prasiddh punjabi vidwaan sukhdev singh sirsa ne apane beej vaktavy main kaha ki shah hossain ne manushya or paramatma ke bich ek aisa ragaatmak sambandh sthapit karne main badi bhoomika adaa kii, jiske madhyam se vyakti ke bheetar viraat maanavtaa paidaa hoti he
 Shah Hussain's devotion and his convictions are in the public mind
 samaaj ke saath unke judaav ne unki bhakthi ko udaar, sahishnu tathaa sabakaa hitkaari bana diya
 The Vice Chancellor of Shimla University, Harmohinder Singh Bedi, while giving the presidential statement in the inaugural session, said that Shah Hussain's works are a bright document of the devotion, adoration and sentiment of a devotee towards his adorable beloved
 koi bhi vyakti jitna adhik sufi- duniya main jaataa he, utana hi shah hossain jaise santon ke saath judata jaataa he
 
 sahitya academy ke kashmiri paraamarsh mandal ke sanyojak or prakhyat kashmiri sahityakar azeez hajini ne 'ranjha mili kitt dhange' vishyak pehle satr kii adhyakshata kii or shah hossain kii kavita par baat kii
 He said that at the core of Shah Hussain's compositions is the passion, love, longing and purity of the Punjabi people, due to which his kafis ascended the people's tongue as folk songs, in this session Harbhajan Singh Bhatia wrote 'shah Hussain da Kalam : Anubhav Ate Andaz ', Mustaq Qadri presented his serious articles on the topic of' Tasawwuf Shah Hussain 'and Ravel Singh' Birha Atte Shah Hussain '
 sufi sant darvesh shah hossain par aadhaarit duusare satr kaa vishay tha 'dard vichhode da haal', jisaki adhyakshata prakhyat punjabi sahityakar sumail singh siddhu ne kii
 In this session, Punjabi young poet and critic Jagvinder Jodha presented his well thought-out article on the subject of 'mai Nee Main Kehanu Aankhen'

 This day is the day of worship of Kaal, this Ashtami is also called Bhairav ashtami
 shuukravaar 14 november ko kalbhairav ashtami he
 Worship done on the day of Ashtami on auspicious day not only provides blessings of Kalabhairava, but can also fulfill all your wishes
 bhairav kaa arth hi hota he bhay kaa haran kar jagat kaa bharan karne vaala
 It is also said that the three letters of the word Bhairav contain the power of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh
 bhairav shiv ke gana or parvati ke anuchar maane jate hai
 Bhairav has great importance in Hindu deities and worship worship on the day of Bhairav ashtami destroys all enemies and sinful powers

 centre main sattadhari modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav par shuukravaar ko charchaa or voting hogi
 For the first time in four and a half years of the Modi government, the opposition has brought a no-confidence motion
 sarkaar ke paas bahumat ke aankade se zyada number hai, isliye wo is prastaav ke safal na hone ko lekar aashwast he
 In the history of the Parliament of the country, so far, no confidence motion has come about 26 times, but only twice the opposition has got success in it
 bhartiya sansad main pehali badhvishwaas prastaav 1963 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehruke khilaaf aayaa tha
 JB Kripalani moved a no-confidence motion against Nehru
 congress ke dobaaraa se adhyaksh na banaae jane ke chalate jebi kriplani ne party chhodkar kisaan majdoor praja party shuru kar di, jo baad main socialist party ke saath milakar praja socialist party main badal gai
 There were 62 votes in favor and 347 votes in favor of the no-confidence motion brought against the Nehru government by JB Kripalani, the then MP of Praja Socialist Party
 is tarah se ye avishvaas prastaav aundhe munh gir gaya
 After the death of Nehru, the Prime Minister of the country became Lal Bahadur Shastri
 teen saal ke unke kaarykaal main vipaksh ke dwaara teen baar avishvaas prastaav laayaa gaya, lekin ek baar bhi vipaksh ko safalataa nahin mil saki
 After this, Indira Gandhi came to power
 shastri ke bache hue kaarykaal ko indira gandhi ne puraa kiya
 During this time a motion was brought against him twice
 bhartiya sansadeey itihaas main sabase zyaada avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii netritv vaali congress sarkaar ko karnaa padaa he
 Against Indira Gandhi, the Opposition has moved a no-confidence motion 15 times, but not once did it succeed
 vipaksh kii ore se sabase zyada avishvaas prastaav pesh karne kaa record marxvaadi communist party ke saansad jyoti basu ke naam he
 All four of his proposals were against the government of Indira Gandhi
 bharat ke sansadeey itihaas main pehali baar vipaksh ke avishvaas prastaav ko safalataa 1978 main mili
 In the post-emergency elections, the Janata Party got a majority and Morarji Desai became the Prime Minister
 morarji desai sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan unke khilaaf do baar avishvaas prastaav laayaa gaya
 The first resolution did not bother him, but in the second motion of no confidence moved in 1978 there were differences among the constituents of his government
 apni haar kaa andaja lagate hi morarji desai ne mat-vibhaajan se pehle hi istipha de diya
 Like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Narasimha Rao's government faced a no-confidence motion thrice
 1993 main narsimha raav bahut kam antar se apni sarkaar ke khilaaf laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ko maat de paae
 The government survived by a margin of 14 votes in voting for the no-confidence motion against the Narasimha government
 haalanki unke upar apni sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye jharkhand mukti morcha ke saansadon ko pralobhan dene kaa aarope bhi laga
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the former Prime Minister of the NDA government, moved the no-confidence motion twice while in opposition
 vaajapeyi jab khud pradhanmantri bane to unhen bhi do baar avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 For the first time, he could not save the government, but the second time he defeated the opposition
 1999 main atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ko jayalalita kii party ke samarthan waapas lene se avishvaas prastaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Vajpayee government was then defeated by 1 vote
 unhone matvibhaajan se pehle hi istifa de diya tha
 After this, the NDA moved a no-confidence motion against Vajpayee in 2003, comfortably defeating the opposition in counting of votes
 endie ko 312 vot mili jabaki vipaksh 186 voton par simat gaya tha
 In 2008, a no-confidence motion was brought against the UPA government led by CPM Manmohan Singh
 yah prastaav america ke saath hue parmaanu samjhaute kii vajah se laayaa gaya tha
 The UPA government, however, survived the fall with a margin of a few votes
 ab modi sarkaar ke khilaaf tidipi avishvaas prastaav laai he

 Ganesh, the founder and owner of Medicare Hospital in Hadapsar, Pune, said, "women who burn due to acid attacks and dowry will be treated free of cost in this burn center
 agar koi purush ilaaj ke liye aata he to usase saamaanya rup se shulk liya jayega
 Ganesh told that a few months ago, the 22-year-old newly married woman, who was victim of dowry harassment, came to the hospital for treatment
 jab mahila ke parijanon ko ilaaj se sambandhit kharch ke bare main bataaya gaya to uske unhone kaha ki agar unke paas itnaa paisa hota to ve mahila ke sasuralwaalon kii dahej kii maang puri kar dete
 The plight of the woman distracted Ganesh and he decided to do something in such cases
 ganesh ne bataaya ki hamaare paas is tarah ke maamalon ke liye vishesh dakshata nahin thi or pune kaa ekmaatr nijee aspataal iske liye 30,000 rupye pratidin kii fees letaa he
 In such cases, treatment lasts for a long time, but due to money, women are unable to get treatment
 yahi sochakar unhone apane sahyogiyon or visheshgyon ke saath vichaar-vimarsh karne ke baad bern centre sthapit karne kaa faisla kiya
 It has also been decided that women from all over the country will be treated free of charge at the burn center

 Ganesh founded Medicare Hospital in 2001 after completing his private practice after completing his studies

 Click agar aap apane relationships kaa asli test lenaa chaahate hai to aapako ek baar apane partner ke saath jarur ghoomane janaa chahie
 It has been concluded from many studies and surveys that people who travel more are happier than those who do not travel
 vyast dincharya or niyamit jeevanstyli se brake milanaa or kisi nai jagah kii taaji hawa se milane vaali khushi kaa to ehsaas karnaa to bahut aasaan he lekin relationships par ye kis tarah asar daalata he, ye samajhnaa thodaa mushkil he
 How do couples who travel together feel? How does this affect their relationship? It may not be like a blessing, but traveling is like a relationship, a bumpy road
 ye utaar-chadhaav hamen bahut kuch sikhaate hai
 They add new experiences as well as a new excitement and thrill within us
 manovaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki apni compatibilti test karne kaa sabase behatar tarika he ki aap us shaks ke saath trip par jarur jaaen
 The US Travel Association has found that couples traveling together are happier and more excited than non-moving couples
 aap chahen apane romantic relationships ko majboot karnaa chaahate hon yaa phir kisi nae rishte ko parakhnaa chaahate hon, ek saath kisi yatra par nikalnaa sabase sahi faisla ho saktaa he
 Let's know how walking together can be challenging for you and your partner and how travel can prove to be the best thing for the time to come
 baton kaa silsilaa-travelinga karte vakt aap kisi naa kisi anjaan jagah par honge
 From the seat of the plane, you will be constantly interacting with your partner on the needs of restaurants and lodging
 agar aapkaa partner aapaki jaruraton or pasand ko nazarandaaj karata he to isse aapke safar kharaab hona tay he
 If you want to relax instead of going on another tour or hike, then tell your partner
 baad main thakaan hone kii khiz main apane partner se ladane ke bajaae or us par pachhtaawaa karne se acha he ki aap apane partner se apane man kii baat kah den
 If you are not comfortable about lodging or anything else, then speak
 ho saktaa he aapkaa partner bhi aapaki hi tarah mahasoos kar rahaa ho
 It is the most important thing for any relationship to speak and listen to the person
 travelinga ke vakt aap or aapke partner ke bich yah buniyadi cheez maujuud he yaa nahin, aap badi aasaani se dekh sakate hai
 Agreements - It cannot happen that two people have a similar view on everything and there is no difference of opinion between them at any time
 ye sari chijen rishte kaa hi hissaa hai or aisi paristhitiyon main ek cheez siikhnaa jaruri he- samjhauta karnaa
 Always try to find a middle ground
 koi bhi aise shaks ke saath ghoomana pasand nahi karegaa jo saare plan apane man ke mutabik banaata ho
 It is important for any relationship to give up one's will on something
 yahi baaten travelinga par bhi lagu hoti hai
 Sharing good-bad Memories - The best time to hang out with a partner is when you can share your good and bad memories with each other
 aap donon ek-duusare kii madad kar sakate hai
 Missing a flight, losing things, sickness, getting hurt, whatever, but it doesn't feel so bad when you have someone to support you all the time
 buree si buree jagah ho par nai jagahon par ek saath jane kaa romaanch bhi alag hi hota he
 Even in a bad relationship, partners do not leave each other even when there are bad times
 ek-duusare kii kharch karne kii aadaton kaa pataa chalata he-agar abhi tak aapako yah thik se andaja nahin ho paaya he ki aapkaa partner kis tarah kharch karata he to ghoomane ke samay sab kuch saaf ho jayega
 Talking about money is often difficult, so traveling will be a test for you in a way
 agar mani handlling ko lekar bhi aap alag-alag chhoron par hai to phir yahaan bhi koi bich kaa rasta nikaal sakate hai
 Whether you like adventure or not? Traveling will also tell whether your partner likes adventure or not, how romantic is that? This seclusionist who likes congestion of cities
 aap camp main ruknaa chaahate hon jabaki aapkaa partner kisi bhi resort hotel room ke baahar bilkul asahaj mahasoos karata ho yaa phir iskaa ulta ho to aap kya karenge? ek saath ghoomane se bahut saare sawaal paidaa honge or aane vaale samay main rishte kaa bhavishya or chunautiyon kaa andaja bhi ho jayega

 abhi kareeb maheene bhar pehle hi mistre ne is reporter ke saath ek mulaakaat main kisi duusare hi sandarbh main baatcheet ke dauraan bataaya tha ki kaise tata samooh sammanjanak vidaai dene main vishwaas karata he
 Apparently, they were talking in a very different context
 unki team ke ek anya sadsy ne vistaar se bataaya tha ki tata main yah kaise aashwast kiya jaataa he ki agar kisi bade adhikari ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ke liye kaha hi janaa he, to uski pratishtha ke saath koi khilwaad na hone paae
 This was an indication of how much mistake Mistry made in reading the signals from the Tata Trusts properly
 tata trust ke pramukh mistre ke purvavarti ratan tata hai or tata sans ke board ke faislon main tata trust kii bahut badi bhoomika hoti he
 Tata Sons is the holding company of the Tata group
 jis atapate tareeke se apane agenda main ''koi or maamla" sambodhit karte hue board ne apane chairman ko hataaya, vah tata samooh kii acchhee chhavi pesh nahin karata
 This group has always felt proud of the way things are done
 yah faisla bhale hi kanoonsammat ho, lekin ek aise samooh ke liye itane varisht adhikari ko hataane kaa aisa tarika shaayad utana naitik nahin, jisane hameshaa na sirf sahi kaam balki har kaam ko sahi tareeke se karne kaa dambh bharaa ho
 Mistry wrote a strong letter to the board with his words, "all i have to say is that the Board of Directors has not done any dignified work
" 
 
 apane chairman ko bina koi kaaran bataae or use apana bachaav karne kaa mauka die bagaiyr hataanaa
 
 
 Perhaps the pages of corporate history will have a different example of their own
 "sab taraf se padtaal kar liye jane ke baad yahi tathy nikalakar aata he ki mistre ko hataae jane kii soochna itvaar, 23 aktubar ko tata sans ke board ke hi ek sadsy ne di
 If sources are to be believed, they were told that if they resign immediately, they will be allowed to leave in a respectful manner
 yah prastaav unako vaaki diya gaya tha yaa nahin, isaki swatantra rup se pushti nahin kii ja saki he
 Sources also say that Mistry should have understood that his time was over as he had been informed by the trust about a year ago that they were not meeting his expectation
 mistre ne board kii baithak main apana paksh rakhkar jokhim uthaane kaa faisla kiya
 He had absolutely no idea that the Tata Trust — in a way Ratan Tata would understand — had been preparing for this work at least a month before
 sabhi sadasyon ko board kii baithak se pehle hi is bare main bataaya ja chukaa tha or yahaan tak ki faisle ke sambandh main kanoonee salaah bhi lee ja chuki thi
 Mistry had to either resign himself or be sacked through a board resolution under "some other matter" in the meeting's agenda
 or jaisaa ki baad main dekhne main bhi aayaa, board ke do sadasyon ne matdaan nahin kiya, baaki sabhi ne unhen hataane ke paksh main apane vot daale
 Ratan Tata himself will continue to play the role of interim chairman until a successor is found
 haalanki cameti ko nayaa chairman khojane ke liye chaar maheene kaa vakt diya gaya he
 The direct announcement of the verdict such as the removal of Mistry immediately after the board meeting caused a shock wave in the corporate community
 yah ek aise shaks kii achaanak hui barkhaastagi thi, jise khud ratan tata ne saal bhar kii talash ke baad apana uttaradhikari niyukt kiya tha or jisane disambar 2012 main chairman kaa pad aupchaarik rup se grahan karne se pehle unke kareeb rahete hue kareeb saal bhar tak kaam kiya
 While assuming his position, Tata had said that Mistry is "his own man"
 mistre ne shaayad is baat ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se le liya
 This decision of the board clearly shows some things
 pehali to yahi ki tata samooh main kisi kaa nishkasana aam taur par itnaa atapata nahin hota—yaa kah sakate hai ki lambey samay se aisa kuch dekhne main nahin aayaa
 The group's earlier controversial farewell was seen when Ratan Tata first took charge of Tata Sons chairman in 1991, a few years after he opened up with that group's satraps Russian Modi, Darbari Seth, Ajit Kerkar and Nani Palkhiwala
 There was a fight (even then this work was done in a good way
 avkaash prapti kii umr seemaa ko ghataakar kshatrapon ko ''ritair" kar diya gaya tha
 After he left, Tata Sons again increased the retirement age limit)
 duusari baat yah thi ki mistre kai vajahon se tata sans ke board main kaaphi gahare ghuse hue the, iske baavjood unhen hataaya gaya
 Apart from being the chairman of Tata Sons, he was also a director representing the business interests of the Shapoorji Palanji family within the board since 2006, when his father retired — 18 of Tata Sons
 5 fisadi share isi parivaar ke paas hai or is tarah se yah sabase bada shairdharak he
 As chairman of Tata Sons and chairman of most of the listed companies of the group, Mistry also represented the shares of Tata Sons that were held by these companies and held around 13 per cent of the total shares
 itnaa hi nahin, isse pehle bhi ve tata ke saath kaam kar rahe the or tata kii kuch companiyon ke board main nideshak bhi rahe the
 His sister Allu is married to Ratan Tata's half-brother Noel
 iske baavjood kul milakar yah samooh ke gathan ke baad se tata sans ke ek chairman ke liye sabase choti avadhi sabit hui
 Cyrus took command at the age of 44 and was set to leave as soon as he reached the 48th threshold of his age
 unka kaarykaal en
 It has been less than the six-year tenure of Saklatwala, who held the post from 1932 to 1938
 isamen doosraa tathy yah bhi he ki sakalathavaala ko hataaya nahin gaya tha, balki unki maut ho gai thi
 Incidentally, Saklatwala was the second chairman whose surname is not Tata
 somvaar 24 aktubar kii shaam tak kuch or suchanaaen saamne ain
 One notice was that the group's executive council has been sacked with immediate effect, including Madhu Kananan, Mukund Rajan, Nirmalya Kumar and Harish Bhatt
 inhen aage rakhaa jayega yaa phir jane ke liye kaha jayega, is bare main abhi kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 However, some reports suggest that old Tata employees Mukund Rajan and Harish Bhatt may be retained, while others may be asked to leave
 barkhaastagi jis tivrata se hui, usase mistre khud sadame main aa gaye
 In a letter sent to the board, he wrote about his reaction that he was "so shocked that it cannot be expressed in words and that the move is" unpredictable in corporate history "
 pratikriya ke liye haalanki ve uplabdh nahin the lekin maheene bhar pehle is reporter se unhone ek baatcheet ke dauraan kaha tha ki tata main tabhi kisi vyakti yaa company ko hataaya jaataa he jab har vikalp aajamaa liya jaataa he, haa, naitikta jaise muddon par samjhauta kiya gaya ho, tab yah apwaad ho saktaa he
 (and till now it is understood that Mistry was not removed for immoral acts
 aisa lagata he ki unhen isliye hataaya gaya kyonki ve kaarobaari apekshaaon par khare nahin utar paa rahe the)
 As more details are coming in, it is becoming clear that there were differences between Tata and Mistry on many things
 mistre apni chitthee main kehete hai ki unki sahmati na hone ke baavjood unhen do vimaanan kaarobaaron (vistara or air asia india) main company ke nivesh ke liye majaboor kiya gaya kyonki tata ''airline kshetra ke prati khaas jhukaav" rakhte hai
 Mistry's letter further states that he had inherited a debt-laden business under which the Indian Hotels Company, Tata Motors Ltd's passenger vehicle unit, Tata Steel Ltd's European business as well as Tata Power and Tata Docomo companies incurred losses She was walking
 unke patr main likhaa he ki in ikaayiyon main 1
 96 trillion rupees - more than the total wealth of the group - in spite of their being 1
 18 kharab ru
 Arrears will need to be forgiven
 sirus apni chitthee main ratan tata kii ore se lagaataar kiye gaye hastkshep kaa bhi hawala dete hai or kehete hai ki samooh kaa kayakalp karne ke liye unhen kabhi bhi apane tareeke se kaam karne kii chhot nahin di gai
 The rising confrontation mechanic and members of the GEC may not have realized this evil, but tensions within the group were steadily increasing
 mistre ne jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad shuruyaat main sheersh prabandhan main koi badlaav nahin kiya tha lekin samay bitne ke saath unhone samooh kii companiyon kii dekharekh ke liye puri tarah se ek nayaa dhaancha khadaa kar daalaa
 The first step was the formation of the GEC which would report only to them and which had to play an important role in the strategic direction of the group and its companies
 jiisi ke sadsy tata sans ke board ke sadsy nahin the
 This was a significant difference in the structure of the group compared to the days of Ratan Tata
 jiisi ke sadsy apekshaakrit yuva bhi the jinaki umr 45 se 55 ke bich hogi
 These people were replacing old people who had been in the group for decades and who had now crossed sixty or seventy
 is tarah kii ek badali hui jiisi ne jab kaman sanbhali, vah vakt tata sans ke kai puraane logon ke ritair hone kaa tha jo samooche samooh main apni bhoomika nibhaate the

 (inamen zyaadaatar haalanki treston se ab bhi jude hue hai)
 Ishaat Hussain, who deals with finance at the group level, was also preparing to leave (there were two group level units under Tata - the Group Corporate Council for strategic planning and consideration, and the Group Executive Office for implementing the plans)
 inke log chairman ko report karte the haalanki zyaadaatar tata sans ke nideshak bhi the)
 In addition to the GEC, Mistry also used the TEBM i
e
 the Tata Business Excellence Model (modeled on the Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award in the US)
 tiibm companiyon ke salanaa moolyankan kaa ek dhaancha tha
 Mistry and members of the GEC were of the view that the interaction between the management of the companies and the TEBM was not always tidy
 asal main samasya yah thi ki tiibm kaa kaam un prakriyaaon kii pahchaan karnaa tha jo awwal darje kii nahin thim
 Apart from this, what improvements could be made was also suggested to him
 lekin companiyon ke varisht prabandhan ne aksar paaya ki tiibm ke sadasyon (or ek tarah se council ke hi kuch sadasyon) ko koi feedback dete hue yaa kisi prastaav ko rakhte hue darasal bijness dynamiks kaa paryaapt gyaan nahin he
 Many top executives of TCS, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Chemicals, Tata Power and other large group companies were uneasy at the suggestions of members of GEC and TEBM
 companiyon kaa prabandhan un mutthi bhar logon se salaah lene kaa koi arth nahin samajhataa tha, jinke paas khud companiyaan chalaane kaa vyaavhaarik anubhav nahin tha
 In addition to the group level, Cirrus was also bringing changes at the companies level
 chaar saal se kam ke unke kaarykaal main tata steel, tata motors or indian hotels ke siio badal die gaye
 In the case of Tata Steel, the CEO had retired, due to which Mistry had to suggest a new name, but the reason for the leadership change at Tata Motors was Carl Slim's untimely demise
 indian hotels main remand biksan ne istipha de diya
 Perhaps there was a disagreement between Mistry and Bickson regarding the strategic approach
 motors or hotels donon hi kaarobaaron main mistre ne padon ko bharne ke liye baahar ke aadmi kii talash shuru kii
 Bickson is believed to have been close to Ratan Tata and his departure and his appointment of Rakesh Sharma were not taken well, although sources say so and could not be independently confirmed
 sutron ke mutabik tata se kuch puraane logon ne nae dhaanchon ko lekar shikaayat kii thi or mistre ke bare main bhi kuch baaten kahi thim
 Sources reveal that initially the Tatas did not pay much attention to these things but over time they gradually started taking them seriously
 badhata gaya avishwasasutra bataate hai ki mistre ke chairman banane ke baad kam se kam ek saal tak ratan tata ke saath unke sambandh behtareen rahe
 All the trusts under Tata's control, he used his influence to support Mistry
 ek samay to aisa aayaa jab ve mistre ko treston main koi bhoomika dene ke bare main soch rahe the or yahaan tak pahunch gaye the ki ve apane avkaash lene ke baad koi aisa rasta bananaa chaahate the taaki mistre in treston ke unke uttaradhikari ban saken
 (the situation at the moment is that Ratan Tata will remain the lifelong head of the trusts that have removed Mistry)
 shuruaati varsh main mistre sabhi ahm masalon par ratan tata se aage badhkar paraamarsh liya karte the
 However, differences have arisen between the two in order to deal with some inherited problems — such as the Tata Nano (which Mistry believes should be discontinued if the car business is to be saved); Expensive purchases made at home and abroad by Indian Hotels that had to be sold at a loss; Ways to deal with Tata Steel UK losses; Some of the assets such as Tata Docomo's entire deal and eventually Tata Power's Indonesia-based mine
 tata trust ke sutara bataate hai ki kuch samay baad mistre ne trust ko kai bade or ahm faislon kii soochna deni band kar di
 Trust is directly related to Ratan Tata
 kabhi-kabhaar to faisle le liye jate, uske baad tata sans ke board ko isaki soochna di jaati thi
 Sources reveal that there were four major decisions that led to particular dissatisfaction: the sale of Tata Steel UK, the decision to buy Welspun Energy's renewable assets, a tussle between Tata and its partner Docomo and others to reduce the group's debt Mistry's efforts to sell global assets
 ek dharna yah bhi thi ki mistre kaa dhada vishuddh munaafe kii line par chalane kaa hami tha or aisi kisi bhi cheez ko bech dene par amada tha jisase munafa na aa rahaa ho
 But during a conversation with this reporter, Mistry had insisted that his view was not like this
 (unhone ishaara kiya tha ki agar maamla aankadon kaa hi hota to aise main tata motors ke gharelu kaarobaar ko jari rakhane kaa koi matlab nahin banataa tha lekin ve ise munaafe main jaataa dekh rahe the or jaanate the ki aane vaale varshon main isaki sthiti kya hogi, isi ke chalate unhone ise bachaae rakhane kaa faisla liya)
 More dissatisfaction with the sale of the uk's steel operations was that Tata felt that the decision was taken without consulting Tata Sons' board and trust
 us vakt 2007 main tata ne jab euke ke kores samooh kaa adhigrahan 12 arab dollar main kiya tha tab yah kisi bhi bhartiya company dwaara kii gai sabase badi videshi kharid mana gaya tha
 It is different that this new business soon became a headache for the new owners
 sabase pehle to 2008 main ai aarthik mandi ke chalate europe main maang main giravat aa gai or laagat badaae lagi
 Efforts were made to bring the business back on track by changing the CEO, and Mistry said that by 2014 it looked as if it could be saved, but the economic slowdown in China from the same year slashed steel prices and demand, China had overproduced it
 ek vakt aisa aayaa jab iskaa asar gharelu parichaalan par bhi padane kii ashanka paidaa ho gai jahaan se ab bhi munafa aa rahaa tha
 Finally, in 2016, Tata Steel started looking for buyers for its overseas business
 tata trust ke andruni sutara bataate hai ki mistre ne tata steel euke ke maamle main jaldi hathiyaar daal die or ise agar do or bikri ke faislon ke saath milakar dekha jaae—do beshkeemtee parisampattiyaan jo india hotels ne neuyork main kharidi thim, saath hi indonesia main koyala khadaan jaisi vaishvik parisampattiyaan vagairah—to isse adhigrahit parisampattiyon ke prati tata samooh kii dirghakaalik vachanabaddhataon ke bare main galat sandesh gaya
 Apparently this became a source of mistrust between the trusts and the former chairman
 takaraav kaa ek or mudda welspan vaikalpik urja kii parisampattiyon kii tata power dwaara kii gai mahangi kharid rahi
 Tata Power was not doing well on financial standards and an allegation against Mistry is that they approved the bidding process without taking the Tata Sons board in confidence
 jiisi ke sadsy is baat par jor dete hai ki yah faisla company kaa tha jo samooh ke str par liya gaya tha
 Mistry and others played only supporting roles in it
 ve kehete hai tata treston se paraamarsh ke bagaiyr yah faisla nahin kiya gaya tha or company main sabhi ko isaki khabar thi
 According to the trusts, Mistry's sale of steel and hotel business to cut debt was piercing his eyes — the huge purchases made in the energy sector raised eyebrows
 tata docomo kaa maamla thodaa jatil he
 Sources reveal that the two had differences over a compromise with Docomo
 tata teleservices ne japan kii antiti docomo ke saath 2008 main gathjod kiya tha jab ratan tata chairman hua karte the
 Docomo 2
 2 arab dollar kaa nivesh kiya tha jiske badale usne 25 fisadi hissedari lee thi or pradarshan ke lakshya spasht the
 The deal says that if these goals do not work or Docomo wishes to get out of this agreement, then it should get at least half that amount
 1 arab dollar praapt hogi, jo usne nivesh kii thi
 Tata's telecom business did not work and incurred losses
 jab docomo ne antat baahar nikalne kii ichha jataai, tab share ke daam itnaa neeche gir chuke the ki use 1
 There was no way to repay the $ 1 billion, except that Tata would have been willing to buy those shares
 docomo kii badakismati hi kahen ki arabiai or bharat sarkaar ne tata dwaara adaa kii ja rahi aisi raashi ke khilaaf apana mat de diya jo share kii keemat ke anukool nahin thi, bhale hi vah samjhaute kaa ang rahi ho
 (this involved the withdrawal of foreign currency, so the Reserve Bank of India intervened in this matter)
 docomo ne iske baad tata ko britain main madhyasthata ke mukademe main khinch liya or 1 arab dollar se upar kii raashi ke haq main faisla le aayaa
 Tata said that it is willing to pay the money provided the Indian government allows it
 agar nahin detii, tab aisa mumkin nahin ho paaegaa
 Ratan Tata felt that Mistry was hurting Tata's reputation by saying that it could affect further deals
 iske bajaae mistre kaa paksh thodaa kathor rahaa or ve kanoonee vikalpon ke paksh main khadey rahe
 Whether or not there actually was a difference of opinion between the two on this issue could not be independently confirmed
 jiisi ke purvavarti sadsy is baat ko samajhane kaa bahut jatan karte hai ki yah dharna hi galat he ki mistre un tamaam chizon ko bechnaa chaahate the jo tata ne kharidi thim or samooh ko zyada munafakari banane ke liye mistre parisampattiyon kii bikri ke kaam main jute hue the
 He claims that the decision to sell was actually the last option when everything else had failed
 anupaat ke maamle main unka maananaa he ki sirus ke netritv main parisampattiyon kii bikri pichhali avadhiyon se koi khaas alag nahin rahi he
 If these were the reasons for mistrust, the new appointments of the board also served to sow some more seeds in it
 mistre kii achaanak barkhaastagi ke kuch maheene pehle hi tata sans ke board kaa vistaar hua
 The primary reason for this was to ensure better representation of Tata trusts
 aarambh main tata sans ke board main ronen sen, ishat hossain, vijay singh or farida khambata sadsy the
 In late August, Venu Srinivasan, chairman of TVS Group, Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Enterprises and Amit Chandra of Ben Capital were inducted into the board
 reportein bataati hai ki nae sadasyon ko mistre se paraamarsh ke bagaiyr shaamil kiya gaya
 In the end it happened that in the last meeting neither new members nor old people favored the mistry
 reporton ke mutabik do sadsy ishat hossain or farida khambata ne vot nahin daale, lekin baaki sab ne mistre ko hataane ke paksh main mat diya
 Fast or too slow? Sources in the trusts show that Mistry was very conservative and very cautious in financial matters
 unke paas ratan tata kii tarah kaarobaar ko badhaane kaa najariya nahin tha
 If sources were to be believed, it took him a long time to choose the new chief of Tata Motors when Carl Slim died prematurely (it took Mistry two years to appoint Gunter Bushek as the new chief)
 ve yah bhi kehete hai ki mistre ke pad grahan karne ke baad bahari taur par bahut zyada gatividhiyaan dekhne ko nahin mil rahi thim—chaahe vah bade adhigrahan rahe hon yaa phir badi greenfield pariyojnaon kii shakl main koi kaam
 On the other hand, there are some critics who say that Mistry was moving very fast towards ending Tata's legacy
 ve iske samarthan main euke sthit tata steel ke kaarobaar kii bikri, duusari parisampattiyon ko beche jane tathaa docomo ke saath chali kanoonee jang kaa hawala dete hai
 As for the Mistry, they would probably agree that they were moving with great vigilance and that their moves were not as fast as other groups
 jahaan tak tata motors vaali baat he, do saal ke dauraan unhone darjanon yogya vyaktiyon se uske pramukh ke pad ke liye mulaakaat kii thi or ant main bushchek ko chunaa kyonki unhen aisa laga ki bushchek ''tata samooh kii samskruti" ke hisaab se upyukt pratyaashee honge
 This is actually the opposite
 shaayad yah dirghakaalik nazariye ko apnaane or tata kii samskruti ke saath koi dakhlandaji nahin karne kaa maamla tha jisane mistre kii maddham chaal vaali dharna ko janm diya
 "we are going to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the group in a couple of years," says a then member of the GEC
 hamaare saare faisle usee sandarbh main liye jane honge ki hamen abhi baduya he or agle 150 saal tak kaayam rahanaa he
 "this was repeated repeatedly in meetings held with the then members of the GEC
 vistaar se dekhen to mistre ke kaarykaal main tata samooh kaa pradarshan mishrit dikhataa he
 The group's revenue during Ratan Tata's tenure was 19 at a CAGR between 1991 and 2013
 2 fisadi kii dar se badha tha
 However, the most rapid growth was between 2001 and 2010 when the group stepped in with considerable aggression abroad and executed several major acquisitions, including Corus and jaguar-landrover, as well as the purchase of the Weberge region
 iske baad haalanki 2008 kii aarthik mandi ke maddenjar kores kaa adhigrahan samooh ke gale kii fans ban gaya
 Cyrus' tenure saw growth rates fall by more than half between 2013 and 2016 and 8 of the CAGR
 5 fisadi par aakar tik gai
 The global economy, on the other hand, was contested and China's growth was witnessing a dramatic decline
 isane tata steel or tata motors donon ke parichaalan ko prabhavit kiya
 This was also an increase compared to the earlier high base
 board ko likhaa mistre kaa patr saaf karata he ki unhen aisa ahsaas tha ki ve ratan tata ke kaarykaal main kii gai kuch keemtee galatiyon main funs gaye hai jabaki unhen teji se karrwai karne kii aazaadee bhi nahin di ja rahi thi
 Whatever growth was attributed to two companies - TCS (more than 20 per cent CAGR) and Jaguar Landover, a Ratan Tata-bought company
 samooh kii baaki zyaadaatar companiyon kii vruddhi teen se chaar fisadi ke bich rahi or tata steel to vruddhi ke maamle main vastav main sankuchit ho rahi thi
 As a group, the profits were also not bright
 duusari ore karj ko mote taur par niyantran main rakhaa gaya or samooh ne salanaa 9 arab dollar se 10 arab dollar ke bich apana puunjigat vyay banaae rakhaa, jisamen adhiktar hissaa kshamta sanvardhan or nae niveshon ko gaya
 On the other hand, the market capitalization of the group companies as on March 2012 was around Rs 4,34,000 crore
 se badhkar march, 2016 main 759,000 karod ru
 Reached saaf he ki bazaar main yah dharna thi ki mistre acha kaam kar rahe hai (haalanki is avadhi main sensex bhi badha, uski rakrataar thodaa alag rahi)
 Of course, Mistry did not race any horse racing, but it has to be kept in mind that the world had changed during his tenure and the slow growth had become a global phenomenon
 ek lanbaa itihaas or bhavishyatamam khabaren aisi aa rahi hai ki mistre shaayad koi mukadmaa kar sakate hai, lekin philhal aisa lagata nahin he
 While going to the press of this story, a press release has been received from him which says that the media should stay away from the speculation of litigation
 sirus mistre ek nitant niztaa main rahane vaale vyakti hai or zyada prachaar ke bhukhe nahin hai
 His family too is going to stay away from the glare and they do not want any kind of publicity in the media, whether good or bad
 isiilie yah maananaa mushkil he ki yah parivaar khud ko ek aisi kanoonee jang main funsane degaa jo use surkhiyon ke centre main laa de
 If there is any indication from his leaked letter, it is only that he wants to tell the board of directors and the public about his work clearly and through the letter, he presented his stand to everyone
 is
 kahani yaheen khatm nahin ho jaati
 If it has been decided not to bring the matter to the public, it does not end the case
 shapurji paalanji samooh koi halaki cheez nahin he
 It is a large multibillion-dollar business with its vast resources
 tata samooh ke saath unka ek saajha itihaas rahaa he jisaki shuruyaat us vakt hui thi jab sirus ke dada shapurji paalanji ne tata main ve share nahin kharide the, jo is parivaar ko tata sans kaa sabase bada shairdharak banaate hai
 In the early days of the Tata group, eminent Parsi debtor Framrose Edulji Dinshaw often used to give loans to the group for its projects
 jab karj chukaana mushkil hota tha to unhen tata sans ke share de die jate the
 Dinshaw was an old friend of the Tata family, so he never thought of selling his shares
 is dauraan shapurji paalanji kaa parivaar mumbai or kahen ki maharashtra ke aadim bilderon main shaamil ho chukaa tha kyonki uskaa kaam bahut saaf tha
 He had built several Tata buildings
 dinshow kaa makaan bhi isi ne banwaaya tha
 When Dinshaw died, Saklatwala was the chairman of Tata Sons and JRD was still waiting in line
 shapurji paalanji ne dinshow estate se share kharid daale
 JRD was offended by this
 baad ke varshon main haalanki ekikaran or anya ghatnaon kaa kuch aisa silsilaa bana ki shapurji paalanji parivaar tata sans kaa sabase bada shairdharak ban gaya jo share trust ke paas nahin the
 Relationships have improved over the years
 sirus ke pita paalanji mistre lambey samay tak tata sans ke nideshak rahe, jiske baad sirus ne kaman sanbhali
 Palanji was of such a bashful nature that he was called the Phantom of the headquarters of Tata, Bombay
 unki parampara ko sirus ne barkaraar rakhaa jab tak ki ve ratan tata ke uttaradhikari nahin chun liye gaye
 Now how this family will react to this incident and whether or not it is in the future womb
 nae chairman ko tamaam samasyaon se nipatna hoga jo ataki padi hai
 The debt on the group is very high and the cases of Tata Steel UK and Tata Docomo are still in the balance
 samooh kii duusari companiyon ko munaafe main laana baahar ke maahaul ko dekhte hue kathin kaam lagata he (haalanki steel kaa gharelu kaarobaar thikthak paisa bana rahaa he)
 There are also some new businesses in which money has to be invested
 is dauraan ratan tata kii vaapasi ho chuki he or mumkin he ki nae chairman ke aane se pehle ve in samasyaon se samooh ko nijaat dilaa sakenge
