 Under this, how to succeed the Namami Ganga Plan in Varanasi, how to stop the sewer and sewer falling in the Ganges, how many MLD sewage treatment plants should be built for this and how to clear the Ganga Ghats, on this TVSN Prasad, Joint Secretary, National Mission Clean Ganga reached Varanasi on Monday to take concrete steps after talking to the municipal corporation and officials
 unhone banaras ke ghat or assi naale kaa gum kar jayja bhi liya
 During this, he told that till now it will cost 6 times more than what was spent for cleaning the Ganges
 yahi nahin ghaaton kii safai or ganga main phenke ja rahe puja ke saamaanon ko nikaalane ke liye ab agenciyo ko jimmaa saupa jaayegaa
 It was also informed that till now, 4 thousand crore rupees have been spent for Ganga and now it will cost 6 times which will come to 25 thousand crore rupees, for which we have sent the details to the cabinet for approval
 piem modi ke sansadeey kshetra se mishan ganga kii raftaar ko teji dene kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 Also, cleaning of Ganga will be started from seven states and cities of Ganga
 jisamen varanasi main ek nayaa treetment plant banaaya jaayegaa
 Around 300 MLD of city sewage falls in the Ganges in Varanasi, out of which only 102 MLD is treated
 ganga safai main kuch aisi yojana bhi shuru ho rahi hai jo ganga ko upar se bhi saafe kiya ja sake, jaise ganga main phenki ja rahi gandagee yaa puja ke saamaanon ko ganga se nikaalnaa, jiske liye saat agenciyon se baat bhi ho gayi he jo ganga main se puja ke saamaanon ko nikaalenge
 Not only this, under the new scheme, plans are also being brought to clean the Ganga edges, ghats with vacuum cleaner
 ganga main koi gandagee na failaa sake iske liye ek task force gathit karne kii bhi baat he
 It means to say that this exercise of cleaning the Ganga is the same old as previous governments have done

 Once again it seems to be the same exercise
 yahi vajah he ki nadi vaigyanik or ganga basin athurity kaa hissaa rahe profesar bi
 D
 treepathi bataate he ki ab tak ganga ko saafe karne ke liye karodon kii yojanaayen ai or paisa kharch bhi hua par ganga pehle se bhi maili hui
 Therefore, instead of clearing the pollution of the Ganges, it is important to release the Ganges water, only then will the Ganga be cleared and only then will all the schemes be implemented
 tippaniyan The talk of bringing the natural flow of Ganga has been arising for decades, but no one knows why it is ignoring the huge cost schemes that the Ganga could never clear
 ye baat aam log or ganga par kaam kar rahe logon kii samaj se pare he
 However, whatever the name Ganges and National River for Ganga work, their first attempt is to stop the pollution going into the Ganges, which will be started from the cities along the Ganges and the cost will be much higher
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki pehle kii sarkaron kii tarah yojanaayen sirf yojanaon tak simit rahati hai ki ganga ko kuch iskaa phayda bhi hoga

 He also took a tour of the Ghats and eighty streams of Benares
 is dauraan unhone bataaya ki ab tak ganga kii safai ke liye jitna kharch hua usase 6 guna zyada kharch hoga
 Not only this, the agencies will now be entrusted with the task of cleaning the ghats and removing the items of worship being thrown in the Ganges
 ye bhi jaankaree di ki ab tak ganga ke liye 4 hajaar karod rupee kharch ho gaye hai or ab isse 6 guna kharch hoga jo 25 hajaar karod rupee tak aayega jisaki manjuuri ke liye hamane cabinet ko detail bhej di hai

 varanasi main ganga main lagbhag 300 emeldi shahar kaa sivej girtaa he, jisame se keval 102 emeldi hi sivej treet ho paata he
 In Ganga cleaning, some such schemes are also being started which can be cleaned from the top of the Ganga, such as the removal of the filth or the objects of worship from the Ganges, for which seven agencies have been talked about
 We will remove the items of worship from yahi nahin, nai yojana ke tahat ganga kinaaron, ghat kii safai karne ke liye vacum clinar se bhi saafe karne kii yojana laai ja rahi hai
 There is also the matter of setting up a task force so that no dirt can spread in the Ganges

 Armaan's task remains incomplete, Tanisha takes the matter in her hand and opens the cage after not getting any response from Bigg Boss

 Kanked Superintendent of Police Rahul Bhagat said that a naxalite named Pandher Rachala was caught from the forests of Bajrangi village in Koilibeda police station area
 uske paas ek ‘tiffin bam’ bhi mila he
 Bhagat said, 'he is a dreaded Naxalite and had a reward of five thousand rupees on him
 isse poochtacha main khulaasa hua he ki naksaliyon ne koilibara thane par hamale kii yojana banaai thi
 He went out to reiki the police station

 ’ After running the government for 10 years in the country and 15 years in Delhi, the Congress is now doing politics of protest
 nai sarkaar aae abhi maheenaa bhar bhi nahin hua he ki party virodh pradarshan se lekar tamaam tarah kii bayaanbaji par utar ai he
 Most of them are leaders who could not win the election
 dilli main bijli kii kami se pareshaan logon kii takalif dur karne ke liye ye netaa sadakon par utar aae hai
 The sit-in demonstration is being done indiscriminately
 apane aapasi gile-shikave bhulaakar ye netaa aapas main galabahiyaan kar rahe hai
 They are taking water-power shortage in such a way as if it is a product of the new BJP government
 ve yah bhuulane kaa swang kar rahe hai ki itane saalon tak dilli or kendra kii sarkaar unhone hi chalaai he or agar kuch galat ho rahaa he to yah unki hi dein he
 The privatization of electricity in Delhi is due to the Congress, about which so many voices are being raised
 agar is vyavastha main koi kami he to uske liye sidhe taur par ve hi jimmedaar hai
 But politics games are unique
 yahaan sach jhooth ho jaataa he or sahi ko galat tehra diya jaataa he
 The Congress is also doing this, its leaders are in a way preparing to impose all their mess on the new government
 kal tak to ye mudde unke liye myne nahin rakhte the or aaj ye bade ban gaye hai
 The BJP is not as upset by this sudden change of Congress as the Aam Aadmi Party
 rajya or desh main virodh kaa swar uthaane vaali yah party sakate main aa gai he
 He was not sure that the Congress would take away this credit from him so soon and it would become a symbol of protest
 lekin party yah samajhane kii koshish nahin kar paa rahi he ki aisa kyon hua
 Actually, she has not been able to get out of the past yet
 use lagata he ki uski jagah surakshit he or virodh kaa swar mukhar karne kaa visheshadhikaar sirf uskaa hi he
 But Kejriwal is unable to realize that times have changed and people too
 yahaan par ab astitv kii ladaai he, unhen phir se apane ko sabit karnaa hoga
 
 baharhaal ab dekhnaa he ki is nai chunauti se party kaise nipatati he
 The Congress is one and a half year old party and knows the tricks of staying in power
 vah sangathit bhi he or uske paas bharpoor sansaadhan bhi hai
 The defeated and defeated Aam Aadmi Party has a direct fight against it
 sach yah he ki congress ke netaa ab phir se maidan main aane kii koshish kar rahe hai or vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin yah bhi utana sach he ki kuch dharna-pradarshan se ve kuch khaas to nahin kar paaenge, bas apane ko raajnneeti main 'jivit' rakh paaenge kyonki aaj jo kuch galat ho rahaa he uski neenv unhone hi rakhi thi
 Shivaratri is said to be the best fast in Hindu theology
 anek varnanon main ise vrathraj bhi kaha gaya he or isaki mahatta ke bare main likhaa gaya he ki yah chaaron purusharth yani dharm, arth, kaam or moksh ko dene vaala mahavrath he
 It is also written in the scriptures that Shivaratri occurs on the Chaturdashi date of Krishna Paksha in every month, but Shivaratri in the month of Phalgun is Mahashivratri, when Shiva was united with Shakti and ushered in the origin of the universe
 shastron ke anusaar, is vrath kii katha ko shraddhapurvak kehane, sunne or padhane se bhi bhagwaan shiv prasann ho jate hai
 Presented here, the most reliable and authentic story of Mahashivratri
 
 
 ek baar devi parvati ne bhagwaan shiv se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth or saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataakar yah katha sunai: “once there was a hunter named Chitrabhanu
 vah pashuon kii hatya karke apane kutumb ko paalataa tha
 He was indebted to a moneylender, but could not repay his loan on time
 krodhit sahuukaar ne shikari ko shivamath main bandi bana liya
 Coincidentally it was Shivaratri that day
 shikari dhyanamgn hokar shiv-sambandhi dharmik baaten sunata rahaa
 He also heard the story of Shivaratri fast on Chaturdashi
 sandhya hote hi sahuukaar ne use apane paas bulaayaa or rin chukaane ke vishay main baat kii
 The hunter left the bond the next day, promising to return the loan
 apni dincharya kii bhaanti vah jangal main shikaar ke liye niklaa
 But due to being in captivity all day, he was disturbed by hunger and thirst
 shikaar karne ke liye vah ek talab ke kinare bel-vriksh par padaav banane laga
 Under the vine tree was the Shivling which was covered with villas
 shikari ko uskaa pataa na chalaa
 The twigs he broke while making the halt fell on the Shivling by chance
 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to the child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ’ shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ’ shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the deer said, 'O Pardhi! i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 ' shikari hansaa or bolaa, ‘saamne aae shikaar ko chhod duun, main aisa murkh nahin
 i have lost my prey twice before
 mere bachche bhukh-pyaas se tadap rahe honge
 In reply, the deer then said, 'just like you are tormenting your children's love, so do me
 isliye sirf bacchon ke naam par main thodi der ke liye jeevandaan maang rahi hum
 Hey Pardhi! Trust me, i promise to leave them to their father and return immediately
 ’ Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrug vineet swar main bolaa, ‘he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 ’ As soon as he heard the deer, the whole night cycle happened in front of the hunter, he narrated the whole story to the deer
 tab mrug ne kaha, 'meri teenon patniyaan jis prakaar pratigyabaddh hokar gai hai, meri mrityu se apane dharm kaa paalan nahin kar paaengi
 So, just as you have left him as a confidant, let me also go
 main un sabake saath tumhaare saamne sheeghra hi upasthit hota hum
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared in front of the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue
 " dharm marmajna or gyanijan bataate hai ki mahashivaratri se judi shikari kii katha ke anusaar devon ke dev mahadev shiv anjaane main kiye gaye sankalp, punya kaary or vrath kaa bhi fal de dete hai
 They are also pleased with a little effort and loyalty, so they are called Ashutosh

 is dauraan havan or gurbani paath kaa jamkar abhyaas kiya or phir vivaah ke anant bandhan main baandhne yani unki shaadi karaane (anand karaj) kaa kaam kiya
 This has been possible due to the efforts of Satguru Dalip Singh, the religious guru of the Namdharis
 unhone guru ramsingh ke haathon shuru hui sikhon main anand maryaada kii parampara ko aage badhaayaa
 Satguru Dalip Singh says that he is working to implement the ideals of Guru Ramsingh to improve the condition of Sikh women in the sect and to give them a stronger place in the society
 unhone bataaya ki sabase pehle 1863 main satguru ram singh ne hi gurbani main se "laavaan" padhakar chah jodon kaa antarjaateey vivaah karke sikhon main anand karaj kii reet shuru karai thi

 The most special thing about the event was that these women did not take any help from the men even in the practice of marriage ceremonies

 Dalip Singh ji says that after marriage, Amritdhari women made the bride and groom get the nectar of Khande
 aisa pehali baar hua jab anand karaj kisari rasmen mahilaon ne puri karain
 Namdhari Sikhs perform fire to the bride and groom in a havan
 haalanki kuch log ise hindu pratha qaraar dekar iskaa virodh karte hai
 But on this Dalip Singh says that it is not possible to give up every practice of Hindus
 sadguru jagajeet singh ke samay bhi kaaphi antarjaateey vivaah hue lekin ab samaaj isaki utani parvaah nahin karata he
 The role of women in performing religious rituals in the Namdhari sect is increasing
 jode kii shaadi karaane vaali sandip cor bataati hai ki shaadi karaane ke baad pados ke ghar main ek shishu kaa janm hua to unke parijanon ne mujhe amrit paan karaane ke liye bulaayaa or phir ham unke ghar gaye
 In that house we got five children to drink

 The 30 percent banknote deposited in the old bank today is 8 November, and memories of the demonetisation are renewed once again
 8 november 2016 ko raat 8 baje pradhanmantri narendra modi ne achaanak 500 or 1000 ke noton ko band karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Actually, notambadi is discussed even today, because every Indian had to face it
 lekin centre sarkaar ne dhire-dhire notembdi se kinaaraa kar liya
 After all, why does the government no longer want to mention demonetisation? On this issue, India Today Hindi editor Anshuman Tiwari says that even after three years the government has nothing to say about demonetisation
 sarkaar bhale hi daawa kare ki notebandi kaa kadam sahi tha, lekin isaki safalataa ko lekar koi pukhta aankada pesh karne main sarkaar naakaam rahi he
 Bitter memories of demonetisation said that after the negative aspects of demonetisation came to the fore, big leaders of the ruling party, including the Prime Minister, have avoided talking about it
 kyonki notebandi ke faisle se puure desh main afra-tafari kaa maahaul ban gaya tha, sabase zyada notebandi kaa prabhaav sangathit or asangathit kshetron ke kaarobaar par padaa
 Because the government had no preparation for demonetisation
 notebandi ke baad har roj niyam badale ja rahe the
 The loss suffered by small industries, in fact, people in the country have not forgotten the problem caused by demonetisation
 notebandi kaa sabase zyada prabhaav un udyogon par padaa, jo zyaadaatar cash main lenden karte the
 It mostly consists of small industries
 notebandi ke dauraan in udyogon ke liye cash kii killat ho gai
 Because of this, his business came to a standstill
 logon kii naukariyaan gayi
 Therefore, the Modi government gave several reasons for bringing the ban on note ban
 isamen kaledhan kaa khaatmaa karnaa, cirkulation main maujuud nakli noton ko khatm karnaa, aatankwaad or naksal gatividhiyon par lagaam kasne samet cashles iconomi ko badhaava dene jaise kai vajahen ginai gai thim
 The government argues that after demonetisation the tax collection increased and the money used in black money has come into the system
 lekin isse jude koi aankade teen saal baad bhi saamne nahin aae hai
 Around 99
 30 puraane note bank main hue jamarabiai ke aankade kehete hai ki notebandi ke dauraan band hue 99
 30 per cent of the old 500 and 1000 notes were returned to the bank
 jab sara paisa waapas bainkon main laut gaya, to aise main sawaal uthta he ki kaledhan ko pakadaney main sarkaar kaise kaamyaab rahi?vikaas dar par asarnotbandi ke baad jidipi ko jhatka laga, jisase desh abhi tak nahin ubar paaya he
 GDP growth rate reduced to 6 in the first quarter after the announcement of demonetisation
 1 fisadi par aa gai thi
 Whereas in the year 2015 it was 7
 9 fisadi par thi
 Currently, the GDP growth rate has come down to 5 per cent, the lowest quarterly figure in the last six years
 aise main modi sarkaar ke liye notebandi ke naakaamiyon se peechha chhudaana aasaan nahin he

 Team India have been out since the ICC World Cup-2019
 is toornament main bhartiya team ne 9 match khele, jisamen use 7 main jeet or 2 main haar mili
 In the 7 matches in which Team India won, too many big mistakes were made by Captain Virat Kohli & Co
 lekin un galatiyon par dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 That is, Team India kept covering its flaws
 number-4 ko lekar nahin dikhe syriasis world cap main team india number-4 par ballebaaji ke liye cheharaa talashti rahi
 This discovery did not end even after reaching the semi-finals, the result of which Team India suffered as a defeat
 chayankartaaon ne vijay shankar, dinesh karthik, lokesh rahul or kedaar jadhav ko chunaa tha
 But all these names failed at number-4 in this World Cup
 haalanki, rahul ne bangladesh ke khilaaf abhyaas match main chauthe number par khelte hue shatak jarur jamaaya tha, lekin shikhar dhawan ke chotil hone ke kaaran unhen rohit sharma ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne kii jimmedaari di gai
 The team remained dependent on the top order
 In this tournament, the matches played by Team India, the top order and bowlers played a big role
 semifinal main newjiland ke khilaaf team india ke top-3 ballebaajon ne behad ghatiya pradarshan kiya
 Openers Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli were dismissed by just 1-1 runs
 vanade itihaas main aisa pehali baar hua jab kisi team ke top-3 ballebaaj 1 ran ke nijee score par out hue hon
 The Indian team had lost 3 wickets on the score of 5 runs
 pant kii laaparvaahee kii andekhiaustralia ke khilaaf match main shatak jadne ke baad team india ke salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan chotil ho gaye
 After this, it was decided to remove KL Rahul from number four and start at number one to start the innings
 aise main number chaar par ballebaaji ke liye rishabh pant ko team main shaamil kiya gaya
 When Pant arrived in England, many former stalwarts were heard saying that Pant is a match-winning player and they will help the team in the World Cup
 lekin pant bada naam banakar rah gaye
 He scored a total of 116 runs in four matches
 unhone chaar pariyon main 32, 48, 4 or 32 ran banaae
 When Team India expected him in the semi-finals, he played his careless shot and gave his wicket
 dinesh karthik kaa role samajhane main chuke34 saal ke wicketiper ballebaaj ko team india ke liye vanade main debyue ke 15 saal baad world cap team ke antim-11 main jagah di gai thi
 Karthik was named in the 2007 World Cup squad, but did not get a chance to play
 is world cap main karthik ne 3 match kii do pariyon main sirf 14 ran banaae
 The team management kept avoiding understanding their role too
 batting order manage karne par nahin diya dhyanis world cap ke aakhri daur main team india apane plaing-11 ko lekar aatmavishvaas se bhari najar nahin ai
 Excluding Mohammed Shami in the semi-finals was shocking
 is toornament main shami ne damdaar pradarshan kiya tha
 However the Indian bowlers did well against New Zealand
 semifinal main chaar wicketipurs ke saath khilne kaa bhi koi matlab nahin banataa tha
 This caused problems in managing batting orders

 It has four Dolby Atmos speakers and a USB Type c port for connectivity
 back panel par do camere die gaye hai jo corner main hai
 The LED flash is not provided which the company should have kept
 front main sirf ek camera he or isamen ultra wide kaa bhi opshan miltaa he
 The design and build quality of the keyboard is quite solid and it is also easy to use
 keyboard kaa leout chota he, lekin ise yuj karnaa aasaan he
 This is not a backlit keyboard, ie the keyboard will not lit in the dark
 keyboard main ek trekkpad bhi diya gaya he jo yuj karne main kaaphi smood he
 However, you do not get much function in the trackpad which is given by a standard laptop

 This notice was issued on the petition of Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M)
 yechuri ne aarope lagaaya he ki unki party ke biimaar vidhayak yusuf tarigami ko avaidh rup se hiraasat main rakhaa gaya he
 The Supreme Court ordered the government to shift Tarigami to AIIMS Delhi based on the advice of doctors
 saath main tarigami ke parivaar ke ek sadsy ko saath rahane kii ijaajat di gai
 Sitaram Yechury filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court regarding the visit to Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir
 supreme court ne seetaram yechuri ko apni party ke biimaar vidhayak or senior netaa mohammad yusuf tarigami se mulaakaat karne ke liye srinagar jane kii ijaajat di thi
 The Supreme Court had given an interim order that Yechury should file affidavit in the Supreme Court after the meeting
 seetaram yechuri ne kashmir se waapas aakar kaha tha ki sarkaar kashmir main halaat saamaanya hone kii baat kah rahi he, lekin waisi sthiti nahin he
 In his conversation with Aaj Tak on reaching New Delhi, Sitaram Yechury had said that i neither spoke to anyone nor went anywhere

 The year 2019 is considered to be important in the country's politics
 maujuuda raajnneetik paridrishy main samajaudi party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai
 In such a situation, both political parties have a chance to revive their politics once again in 2019
 aise main dekhnaa he ki akhilesh yadav or mayawati aapas main haath milakar itihaas rachate hai yaa phir khud itihaas ban jate hai?desh kii satta kaa faisla uttar pradesh se hota he
 The state has the highest number of Lok Sabha seats
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi isi uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 par jeet darj kar pradhanmantri kii kursi par kabiz hue the
 In the Modi wave, the SP was reduced to its clan and the BSP could not even open an account
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 23 saal kii dushmani ko bhulaakar in donon dalon ne soobe ke upachunaav main haath milaayaa to unhen jeet kaa formula mil gaya
 SP-BSP can join hands once again to repeat the same formula in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utarate hai to soobe main ek baar phir nayaa siyaasi itihaas rach sakate hai
 Actually, SP-BSP 41 despite the Modi wave in 2014
 80 fisadi vot hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 While 42 to BJP
 30 fisadi vot mili the
 However, the political equations have changed in five years
 maujuuda daur main na to 2014 ke chunavi jaisi modi lahar he or na hi soobe main sapa-basapa satta main he
 At the same time, the BJP is in power from the center to the state and the opposition is constantly busy in besieging the government
 centre kii modi or rajya kii yogi sarkaar ko sattavirohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The indications of this are the results of the by-elections in three Lok Sabha and one assembly seats in the state, in which the BJP had to face defeat
 jabaki in siton par pehle bijepi kabiz thi
 With the coming of the SP-BSP, bjp's path will become very difficult in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 soobe main donon dalon ke paas majboot vot bank he
 The state has 12 per cent Yadavs, 22 per cent Dalits and 18 per cent Muslims, which together constitute 52 per cent of the population
 in teenon samudaay ke votbank par sapa-basapa kii majboot pakad maani jaati he
 In the 1993 assembly elections in the state, the SP-BSP made history by forming an alliance
 mana ja rahaa he ki sapa-basapa 23 saal ke baad ek baar phir gathbandhan karke siyasat kii nai ibaarat likh sakate hai or bijepi ke liye 2014 ke chunaav nattejey doharaana mushkil hoga
 At the same time, if the SP-BSP do not come together in the electoral fray in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then the bjp's path will become easy once again
 darasal, ye baat isliye kahi ja rahi he ki akhilesh yadav lagaataar basapa ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kar rahe hai, lekin basapa adhyaksh mayawati is sambandh main abhi tak chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Not only this, what political steps will Mayawati take, no one can say with confidence
 jaankaron kii maane to kinhin raajnneetik kaarnon se agar sapa-basapa gathbandhan nahin karte hai to unke itihaas banane kaa khatra ho saktaa he

 The great thing is that the Delhi Metro administration is busy in smudging it and denying any incident

 lekin vah folling mark ko paar kar gai
 During this time another metro was also coming and started rubbing each other
 bataaya jaataa he ki is jaanaleva laaparvaahee ne puure metro prashasan ko hilaa diya he
 Because if such an incident happens in the metro running with passengers, then it is not easy to imagine the damage caused by it

 The Supreme Court has reserved the decision to send the matter to the Constitution Bench to provide reservation to the economically weaker people
 ab sheersh adaalat is baat kaa faisla karegi ki 103wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke nirnay par samvidhan peeth faisla karegi yaa nahin? sheersh court ne saaf kiya ki is maamle ko samvidhan peeth ko bhejne yaa na bhejne ke faisle ke baad hi koi raahat di jaaegi

 This brought great relief to the central government
 iske saath hi sheersh adaalat ne aarakshan ke faisle kaa virodh karne vaali sabhi yachikaaon par teen saptaah ke andar sunwaayee karne kii baat kahi thi
 During this, Justice SA Bobde had said that the decision of the Central Government to give reservation to the upper castes financially can be reviewed

 The petition filed in this case said that this law is against the basic principle of giving reservation to the constitution

 Let us tell you that before the Lok Sabha elections, the bet was to give 10 percent reservation to overcome the resentment of the upper castes
 iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kiya gaya tha
 After this the decision of the Modi government was challenged by many organizations in the Supreme Court

 bihar main jediu or bijepi ke bich netritv kaa matbhedsanjay paswan bole- nitish nahin modi model kii jaruratbihar main janata dal united (jediu) or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke bich netritv kaa matbhed ubharkar saamne aane laga he
 The jdu's opposition to the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in particular is not appealing to the bjp's top leadership
 isliye ab bijepi kii taraf se netritv par sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai
 Senior BJP leader and MLC Sanjay Paswan says that now Modi model is needed instead of Nitish model in Bihar
 paswan ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne jithan ram maanjhi ko mauka diya, ab bijepi ko bhi mauka dena chahie
 Why always remained BJP deputy sanjay paswan kaa yah bayaan apane aap main bahut kuch kah rahaa he
 Opposition to many decisions of NDA may be known that JDU opposed three divorces while staying in NDA
 anuchhed 370 kaa virodh kiya or ab enarasi kaa virodh kar rahi he
 However, the BJP also believes from the outset that a large number of Bangladeshi infiltrators live in Bihar's Seemanchal, but JDU does not like the National Civil Register (NRC)
 sanjay paswan ne aage kaha ki jahaan enarasi puure desh main lagu ho rahaa he vahaan uski sahyogi party virodh main hai
 Just as the JDU has the right to speak, so are we
 gauratlab he ki ram mandir, anuchhed 370, teen talaak or vartmaan main enarasi bijepi ke liye ahm mudda he or in sabhi muddon par jediu kaa virodh rahaa he
 Although JDU has been opposing all these issues since 1996 when they were aligned, but what happened now is that BJP does not like opposition on these issues
 'bijepi netaa ko banaaya jaae siem'haalanki, sanjay paswan kaa kahana he ki ab janata hameshaa mudda ko swikaarne lagi he
 The public has given Narendra Modi a chance again on these issues
 in muddon par hamaare sahyogi dal main hi matbhed ho ye shobhaa nahin de rahaa
 Sanjay Paswan pressurized Nitish Kumar, saying, 'they should give BJP a chance now
 vaise bhi bijepi kaa ek mukhyamantri ho aisa bihar kaa har aam aadmi chahta he
 Be it Sushil Modi or Nityanand Rai, these are the faces who can be given a chance
 kab tak ye dipti ban kar rahenge
 At the same time, Paswan said that despite all this, the alliance is not going to be affected, BJP and JDU are united

 Mukherjee is believed to have a conflict with Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 dhoni ne kolkata test ke liye terning pich maangi thi jabaki mukherjee ne kaha tha ki yah maang betuki he kyonki do pichen ek si nahin ho sakati
 Only after this, BCCI entrusted Bhowmik to prepare the pitch
 mukherjee ne kaha, ‘mujhe laga tha ki cab meraa saath degaa lekin vah bhi mere peeche pad gaya he
 My blood pressure was increased to 170-100 on Friday
 chekup ke baad doctoron ne mujhe ek maheene aaraam kii salaah di

 Mukherjee, who lost his 73-year-old wife and 31-year-old daughter within six days, is also struggling with mental depression
 unhone kaha, ‘meri beti kaa nidhan 25 may ko hua or 31 may ko meri patni chal basii
 Despite this, i did not take a day off
 meri patni ke nidhan ke ek din baad main eden garden par tha
 No one can question my commitment but the cab treated me badly
 ’yah poochne par ki kya vah lautenge, mukherjee ne kaha, ‘dekhnaa padegaa
 i have become very old now and the death of wife and daughter has made me weak

 Rahul Gandhi's party Congress, which calls itself a 'soldier of tribals' in Delhi, has a government in Himachal Pradesh and the Himachal government has moved a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the right of the tribals to the Gram Sabha

 a hydro-power project of about 130 MW is proposed in the Kinnaur Valley of Himachal Pradesh and the forest land of the villages falling under the project will be affected and the villagers will also have to be displaced
 kanuunan aise project ko pehle forest clearence lenaa zaruri he, jisamen gram sabhaaon kii sahmati chahie

 sabhi jaanate hai ki akhrot sehat ke liye bahut phydemand hote hai
 But do you know that women can be safe from breast cancer by eating walnuts

 He further explained, our team has hypothesized that nut consumption changes the genes of women with pathologically confirmed breast cancer, which can reduce breast cancer growth and its risk
 study ke pehle trial main aisi mahilaon ko shaamil kiya gaya jinaki breast main ganth thi
 These women were asked to eat about 56 grams of walnuts daily until the next surgery, 2 weeks after their first biopsy

 tippaniyan Nasir Hussain of Indian origin was born in Chennai
 varsh 1989 se 2004 ke bich unhone 96 test or 88 vanade maichon main england kaa pratinidhitiv kiya

 He said that the Ministry is talking to NITI Aayog, Ministry of Human Resource and Development and Ministry of Health to provide sanitary pads in schools, increase grant of voluntary organizations and provide pad-destroying machines

 From Sonam Kapoor to Alia Bhatt, the celebs have challenged Padman to say that even Akshay Kumar has said on the issue of removing GST that the government should not remove GST but give sanitary napkins to the poor women of the villages for free
