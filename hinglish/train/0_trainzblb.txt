 a contempt notice has been issued by the Nainital High Court against the two officers for non-payment of a fine of Rs 25,000 in retaliatory action against the officer
 court ne 26 july tak upasthit hokar jawaab dene ko kaha he
 It is also said that why not take action against them in a contempt case
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah durlabh maamla he ki jab sarkaar ke kisi ang ko apane hi adheen kaam karne vaale afasar ko pratadit karne ke maamle main court ne vindictive(pratishodhi) qaraar dete hue karrwai kii he
 Magsaysay Award-winning Indian Forest Service veteran Sanjeev Chaturvedi, in his contempt petition filed in the Nainital High Court, said, "he (the Ministry's responsibilities) took just 48 hours to give me zero in my annual confidential report (ACR), while writing ACR Three months is scheduled for

 Mobile bills, smartphones and computers can be affected after the GST i

 Goods and Services Tax
 telecom par 18 fisadi kaa alag se tex lag saktaa he
 The GST Council meeting is over
 is baithak main shiksha or swasthya dekhbhaal ko jiesti se chhot dene kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 But this can make smartphones expensive
 1 july se puure desh central exise or sarvice tex chukaanewaale kaarobaariyon ko in nai daron par jiestika bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Not only this, the handsets made in India with GST can be a bit expensive, because they will be taxed more
 maujuuda daur main ipper 7
 5 to 8 percent tax is levied, but after the implementation of GST, they will come in the slab of 12 percent, due to which the prices of the device may also be affected
 isse aapke mobile bill par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 Because currently there is a provision of 15% service tax in telecom services
 lekin jiesti ke baad yah badhkar 18 fisadi ho jayega
 Hence the phone bill may increase
 ET ke mutabik agar aap 1000 rupee kaa mobile bill dete hai to jiesti ke baad 30 rupee zyada dene honge
 According to reports, after GST, it is possible that the handsets made in India will become expensive and after that obviously imported devices will look cheaper than it
 sibar media research ke mutabik jiesti ke baadahandset kii keemten 15 se 25 fisadi tak badhsakati hai
 However, this firm has also said that the timing of GST implementation will play a significant role in it
 counter point research ke mutabik 2017 kii pehali timahi main lagbhag paanch main se chaar mobile phone maid in india hai
 That is, when GST is implemented, local manufacturers will be affected because of this, inflation can be recorded in the mobile market
 bihar main lagaataar ho rahi aapraadhik or mob liching kii ghatnaon kii vajah se siemanithish kumarvipaksh ke nishane par hai
 This is the reason why he met the Chief Secretary DGP and Home Secretary on Wednesday and reviewed the law and order of the state
 meeting main mukhyamantri ne adhikariyon ko jimmedaari tay karne kii hidaayat di or kaha ki police mukhyalay khud isaki monitoring kare
 During the meeting, the Chief Minister was particularly concerned about lynching and communal tension
 unhone kaha ki sabhi jiladhikari or police adheekshak apane-apane jile main isaki samiksha karen
 Also communicate with people
 unhone aage kaha ki rajya ke kanoon vyavastha main kisi prakaar kii dhilaai bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 The CM of Bihar said that whatever deficiencies are there, it should be completed in police stations without any delay
 rashtriya str par jo bhi suvidhaayen mil rahi he wo sabhi suvidhaayembiharki police ko milani chahie
 He also said that separate teams should be formed for crime investigation and law and order
 chargeshit maamalon kii spidi trial ho or sampradayik maamalon kii jald sunwaayee ho
 The Chief Minister directed that an FIR can be lodged in any police station
 iske baad us cese ko transfar karne kii vyavastha ho
 Every station should have a chair and newspaper, sufficient amount should be made available to the police station for everyday expenses
 iske alaava prayek thane main do gadiyon kii vyavastha kii jaae
 CM further said that in cases of crime, police stations should be monitored and warrants reviewed
 ye monitoring dijipi ke str par ho
 He said that the rule of law should prevail in Bihar under all circumstances
 iske liye jo bhi suvidha chahie lijie lekin aparaadhiyon ke manobal ko todie
 Let me tell you that earlier this review meeting was to be held on September 4 but it was postponed due to ill health of CM Nitish Kumar
 lekin ab nitish kumaar is maamle ko lekar kaaphi gambhir dikh rahe hai

 Sharing a post like this and joining the global awareness on sexual assaults on women all over the world and showing solidarity to each and every woman who sailed on the same boat, shows the magnitude of the problem
 m surprised that some 'good ' men are shocked to see the number of women who have come out and shared their # metoo experiences
 NO DON'T BE
 This is happening in your own backyard, in your own house, with your own sister, daughter , mother, wife or even your maid 
 
 
 Gain their trusts and ask them
 You will be surprised at their answers
 
 You will be surprised with their stories
 
 Writing something like this brings me to tears reliving those memories as a little girl when i was scared of the neighbourhood uncle and his prying eyes who at any given opportunity would grope me and threaten me not to speak about this to anyone 
 
 
 
 
 OR my much older cousins who would eye me differently than their own daughters
 
 
 
 OR the man who saw me at the hospital when i was born and 13 years later he thought it appropriate for him to touch my body because i was a growing teenager and my body had changed
 
 
 
 OR my tuition teacher who had his hands in my underpants
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OR this another teacher , whom i tied Rakhi to, would scold the female students in the class by pulling their bra straps and slapping on their breasts 
 
 
 
 
 OR that man in the train station who gropes U
 
 
 Why ?? Because you're too young and scared to speak up
 So scared that you can feel your stomach getting twisted inside and throat getting choked up
 
 
 you don't know how are you going to explain it to your parents or you're too shy to utter a word to anyone 
 
 
 
 And then you start developing that deep rooted hatred towards men 
 
 
 Because you know they're the culprit who made you feel this way
 
 That disgusting, twisted feeling inside which takes years to overcome
 
 
 
 m happy to be another voice joining this movement and make people realize that i was not spared either
 But TODAY i will rip apart any man who even remotely tries anything on me
 i AM PROUD OF WHO i AM

 Diplomatic turmoil has intensified in many Arab countries, including Palestine, over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Israel, due to which Indian diplomacy is caught in the israeli-palestine dispute
 modi pehle bhartiya pradhanmantri hai, jo isroyal kaa daura kar rahe hai
 Interestingly, PM Palestine will not go to the Palestine which India has been supporting on the international stage
 isroyal or philistin ke bich pichley 50 saal kaa khooni sangharsh aaj bhi jari he
 In June 1967, there was a six-day arab-israeli war, after which Israel captured Palestine's West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip
 bharat samet duniya ke tamaam desh philistin par kabja karke yahuudi basti basaane ke isroyal ke kadam kii tikhi aalochana karte aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, PM Modi's limited tour to Israel is being seen as a major change in Indian diplomacy
 sanyukt raashtra main is maamle ko lekar isroyal ke khilaaf prastaav bhi laayaa ja chukaa he, lekin usko is par america kaa saath miltaa rahaa he
 However, India always supported Palestine against Israel
 haal hi main sanyukt raashtra main obama prashasan ne bhi pehali baar isroyal kii mukhaalafat kii thi
 This deteriorated the relations between the two countries, but Donald Trump once again became close to Israel after becoming president
 ab sawaal bharat ke isroyal ke kareeb jane kaa he
 India is the first non-arab country to recognize Palestine against Israel and forge political ties
 haalanki saal 1992 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pivi narsimha raav ne apni purvavarti sarkaar se hatakar kadam uthaaya or isroyal ko manyata di
 Since then, the relationship between India and Israel has grown
 saal 2015 main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne bhi isroyal kaa daura kiya tha, lekin vah jordan or philistin hote pahunche the
 India and Israel are celebrating the 25th anniversary of their relationship
 bharat aksar hi philistin ke paksh main rahaa he
 The reason for this was that India believed that moving closer to Israel would offend many Arab countries
 agar aapke passport par isroyal kaa vija lag jaae, to arab deshon se vija milanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 However, Pranab Mukherjee broke this notion
 in arab deshon main kaaphi sankhya main bhartiya kaam karte hai or bharat petroleum padaarth ko lekar bhi in par kaaphi had tak nirbhar he
 Indian officials currently say that India has close ties with both Israel and Palestine
 modi ke daure se donon deshon se rishte main koi fark nahin padegaa
 Despite all this, it is clear from Modi's visit that India's diplomacy about the Arab region is changing

 The comments unhone kaha, 'ham log vishwa bhar main upyog main laai ja rahi takneekon kaa adhyayan kar rahe hai or is samasya se puri tarah nipatane ke liye ham log pehle hi kareeb do darjan pariyojnaayen shuru kar chuke hai
 We have already spent 20 crores for this purpose '
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In response to a question, the Union Minister said, 'not only Delhi but all cities are facing the same problem
 ye shahar subah main to saaf hote hai, lekin shaam tak gande ho jate hai
 There is a need to change the mindset of the people
 amuman logon kaa aisa maananaa he ki shahar kii safai kii jimmedaari safaikarmiyon kii hoti he
 This requires everyone's efforts'
 hasharvardhan ne iske baad dilli sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaha, 'lekin dilli main ek or samasya he or vah yah ki ham log vahaan satta main nahin he
 The entire focus of the AAP government is on targeting the Prime Minister

 baatcheet ke pramukh ansh
 What are the plans to bridge the gap between power demand and supply? We are working under a goal-oriented strategy
 2015 tak bihar atirikt bijli vaala pradesh ban jayega
 Apart from the current availability, Bihar will also get its share from ntpc's 3,000 MW Super Thermal Power Plant in floods
 pehali ikai to isi saal shuru ho jaaegi jabaki duusari ikai 2014 main shuru hogi
 In addition, Kanti and Barauni power plants together will generate more than 600 MW of power
 2015 se adani samooh bhi ek samjhaute ke tahat bihar ko 1,000 megawatt bijli pradaan karegaa
 We are confident that by 2015 Bihar will have no less than 5,000 MW of power
 bijli kii adhiktam maang 4,000 megawatt pahunch jane par bhi hamaare paas 1,000 megawatt atirikt bijli hogi
 Your government has not increased the generation capacity by a single megawatt since assuming power for the first time in November 2005? Bihar last increased its generation capacity in 1977 during Karpoori Thakur government
 november, 2000 main bihar vibhaajan ke baad pradesh kaa vidyut utpaadan 440 megawatt hi rah gaya
 From October 2003, repair work started in Kanti

 For this we will get Rs 45,000 crore

 By 2015, there will be one power substation in every block of the state
 iske alaava ham utpaadan, pareshan, vitaran, conection or collection ko sudhaarney ke liye kadi mehnat kar rahe hai

 Boycott said, 'do you look at the captains in proportion to their wins and losses or do you look at the level of the team? If you are thinking about India then the team is lacking in level, the team lacks the level of fast bowling, the level of spin bowling is lacking and some of your players are starting to retire

 ’boycott ne kaha, ‘aapke paas kaaphi achche khilaadi hai lekin duniya kii anya stareey team kii tulana main aap bahut ausat ho or aap ek ausat team ke saath nahin jeet sakate
 The captain is always blamed for this
 jab team jitati he to captain kii prashansa kii jaati he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki yah anuchit he
 He said that Dhoni cannot be held responsible for the team as India is a team which is going through a phase of change

 jeenyu main chaatrasangh ke chunaav ke bich kanhaiya kumaar ne campus ke chaatro ke naam ek patr likhaa he
 He has thanked the students through a long post on Facebook, which entrusted him with the responsibility of the President of the Students' Union
 kanhaiya ne kaha ki adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari se mukt hote hue shukriya kahana ajeeb lag rahaa he, lekin sangharsh ke har mukaam par saath rahane waalon ke wo abhaari hai
 Read, Kanhaiya Kumar's thank you post It seems strange to thank your people on the occasion of relieving the responsibility of JNU Students Union President, but i do not know why to express my gratitude to those people again and again
 i feel like standing with me in some form or the other at every stage of the struggle
 jeeneuke vidhyaarthiyon, shikshakon, karmchaariyon, purv vidhyaarthiyon or campus ke baahar ke tamaam shubhachintakon kaa shukriya jo samaaj main samanta, nyaay va loktantr ko bachaae rakhane ke liye samaaj ko peeche dhakelne vaali takaton ke viruddh jeenyu chaatrasangh ke sangharsh # standwithjnu main shaamil hue
 In every possible effort to discredit and ruin JNU and its students' union, colleagues like you have told them that the democratic thinking with which JNU has always stood by is many times more than the power of all rioters and conspirators
 mujhe yaad aa rahaa he ki chaatrasangh adhyaksh kaa chunaav jeetne ke baad maine victory march (vijay juluus) nahin balki unity march nikaala tha, kyonki main or meraa sanghathan hameshaa hi unity ke paksh main khadey hue hai
 And throughout my tenure, i got the support of many people who ideologically disagree with me on many issues
 mere kaarykaal main sabase pehla virodh pradarshan afatiaiai ke sangharshrat saathiyon ke samarthan main hua tha or puure saal desh ke tamaam campason main sampradayik or fasivadi takaton ke viruddh uth rahi awaajon ke paksh main jeenyu chaatrasangh ne apni aawaaj buland kii or 9 farvari ke baad in sabhi campason main # standwithjnu kii aawaaj gunji
 Whether it is the Occupy UGC movement to save the scholarship or the struggle to punish the culprits of the institutional murder of Rohit Vemula, or the protest against the atrocities in Dadri and Una, thank you for all the support you got on every occasion 
 ham jisha or delta ko nyaay dilaane ke liye bhi lade or ambedkar bhawan ko giraane kii sajishon ke khilaaf bhi
 Struggled for better facilities in the library on campus and also for punishing the rapist student
 jin logon ne mujhe vot dekar is pad ke kaabil samajha, un sabakaa shukriya
 i would also like to thank those who wholeheartedly did not vote for me and may not have fully agreed with my political ideology, but who took to the streets in large numbers to support my freedom of speech
 main jaanata hum ki ve kanhaiya kumaar ke liye nahin balki apane nirvaachit chaatrasangh adhyaksh ke liye sadakon par utre the
 Thanks to all the teachers who faced all the difficulties and stood with the JNU Students' Union, who said that 'kanhaiya will be the first to see the faces of the teachers standing in his support when he comes to court from the police remand' and every turn of the struggle
 But he helped in every way in this movement
 un sabhi karmchaariyon ko bhi meraa aabhaar jo hamaare is sangharsh main shaamil hue
 Thank you to all those who wrote articles and Facebook posts in support of me and for whom i did not know how abusive they had to eat with people who considered me a traitor and a Sanghi mentality
 jo mere or anya saathiyon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron ke paksh main apane gharavaalon, mitron or desh ke anya nagarikon se taarkik bahes karne main kabhi peeche nahin rahe
 If you are there is democracy
 aazaadee chowk par har din badi sankhya main pahunchakar prashasan ke anyaay ke khilaaf morcha kholane vaale saathiyon kaa bhi abhaari hum
 Thank you also to the people who encouraged the JNU in their visits to different parts of the country to put them in front of the people
 mujhe is baat kaa ahsaas he ki main chunaav se pehle aap logon se kiye gaye apane kai vaade puure nahin kar paaya, lekin jeenyu par is tarah ke apratyaashit hamale ke daur main or maujuuda raajnneetik halaat main apni jimmedaariyon ko nibhaane kaa harsambhav prayaas maine kiya he
 i remember addressing you after i returned from prison when i said the first word - 'comrades' and the enthusiasm with which you all encouraged me, this enthusiasm and support remained my energy throughout the struggle
 puure desh main shiksha vyavastha par jis tarah kaa hamalaa sarkaar or navaudaravaadi takatein kar rahi hai, samaaj ke vanchit virgon, daliton, mahilaon, pichhadon, adivaasiyon or alpsankhyakon par atyaachaar jis tarah se badha he, mujhe ummid he ki nai chunakar aane vaali union uske viruddh sangharsh kii mashaal ko bujhane nahin degi
 Efforts to address the problems of students on campus will be taken forward and the struggle for better facilities and scholarships will continue
 main jeenyu kii janavaadee soch ke paksh main hameshaa khadaa rahoonga
 Fight to implement Rohit Act or fight against Lyngdoh recommendations to strengthen campus democracy, fight to ensure the rights of underprivileged people in the society or to raise voice against communal fascist forces and against plunder of labor
 Efforts, education for all, to ensure work for all and to establish equality and justice in society

 kanhaiya kumarajeenyu chaatrasangh adhyaksh (2015-16) In Bihar, the line of trust between JDU and RJD is getting weaker
 agar bihar main mahagathbandhan main bikharaav hota he ki iskaa asar keval bihar kii raajnneeti hi nahin, desh kii raajnneeti par bhi padegaa
 Because in Bihar, the way the grand alliance won the assembly elections, it inspired regional parties of other states
 khaskar uttar pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main sapa or basapa kii karaari haar ke baad ek sawaal saamne khadaa tha ki agar bihar ke tarj par upi main sapa or basapa saath hote to chunaav parinaam kii tasviir kuch or hoti
 Not only this, even in the future, these two parties were ready to enter the party, to fight against the BJP, which was indicated by Akhilesh Yadav himself
 iske peeche chahebijapi kaa darho yaa phir raajnneeti astitv ko bachaae rakhane kii koshish
 Now the big question is that if Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav follow different paths in Bihar, then the way ahead will be easy for both of them? Or will this decision endanger the existence of both? In this fight of JDU-RJD, the breakdown of alliance may prove more harmful for Nitish
 1
 If Nitish Kumar is separated from the Grand Alliance, then he has BJP as an alternative
 nitish bijepi ke samarthan se satta main bane rahenge
 But will he be able to implement his decisions in Bihar with the BJP in the 'modi era'
 kyonki haal ke dinon main jin rajyon main bijepi kshetreey dalon ke saath satta main bhagidaar rahi, vahaan kshetreey partiyaan kamjor hui hai
 In such a situation, in addition to running an alliance with BJP, it will be a challenge for Nitish to maintain his political ground
 2
 Nitish Kumar definitely has an advantage in being with Lalu Yadav
 kyonki lalu yadav jis tarah se ghotaalon ke kai maamalon main ghire hai isse unki nijee sakriy raajnneeti kii raah aage bhi aasaan nahin he
 In such a situation, Nitish will always be on the front foot in an alliance with the RJD, and with this Lalu too probably has no objection and will not
 yahi nahin, pichley do saalon main ye dikhaa bhi he ki lalu yadav ne kabhi nitish ke faislon par sawaal nahin uthaaya
 3
 jis tarah se nitish kumaar kii aguwai main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ne bihar main do saal kaa safar bina kisi vivaad kaa tay kiya he, usase nitish kumaar kaa bihar ke baahar bhi kad badha he
 In other non-bjp ruled states, like the nitish-lalu alliance, regional parties were thinking of coming together on one platform, Nitish's decision to step aside would end before the alliance was formed in other states
 khaskar uttar pradesh main iskaa asar padegaa
 4
 nitish kii ore kshetreey partiyon ke alaava congress bhi ummid kii najar se dekh rahi he, kyonki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se jis tarah congress dinon-din kamjor padati ja rahi he aise main bihar ke baahar bhi nitish kii raajnneetik pakad or majboot ho sakati he
 Not only this, if Nitish comes out openly against BJP and Narendra Modi, then he can get support of Congress along with all regional parties
 5
 Even though there are 80 mlas from Azerbaijan in Bihar, Lalu Yadav will try to save the Grand Alliance till the last moment
 haalanki wo philhal tejasvi ke istife par samjhaute se inkaar kar rahe hai
 But he knows that if Nitish separates from the alliance, the political existence of the RJD may be questioned
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki aaj se 2 saal pehle jis tarah se jediu-argedy ke alag hone se bijepi kii takat badi thi, or lalu ke saath-saath nitish ke raajnneetik bhavishya par bhi khantra mandaraane laga tha
 In such a situation, Nitish's separation from Lalu can be a big and dangerous decision
 agar aap bachat ke liye ipief par ashrith hai to aapke liye acchhee khabar he
 Now you will get more interest on your Employee Provident Fund
 provident fund trustees ne ipief main saadhe nau (9
 5) has decided to give interest according to the percentage
 interest kii yah dar saal 2010-11 ke liye hogi
 Employees of both private and public sectors will benefit from the increase in interest rate of EPF
 isse kareeb 4 karod 71 lakh naukareepesha logon ko phayda hoga
 So far eight and a half (8 on EPF)

 Since the law has become strict about the protection of women, the cases of false complaints of rape have also increased
 aise main dilli hai court ne kaha he ki jhuthe mukademe daalane vaali mahilaon ko sakht sajaa di jaaegi
 When Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhatt faced a case of false gang rape against 2 young boys from Delhi, he directed the court staff to bring the complaint of false woman to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate
 court ne kaha ki, 'maanavtaa or dayaa ke chalate ham balaatkaariyon ko kadi se kadi sajaa dete hai
 But nowadays women are also taking advantage of it wrongly
 court ko ab khud jimmedaari leni hogi or un logon ko sahaara dena hoga jinke upar jhuthe aarope lagaaya jate hai
 It is very difficult to bring back the dignity and prestige of the person who is accused of rape
 lekin agar aarope jhootha he to ye naammumkin bhi nahin
 'in the case after which the High Court has shown this strictness, in that case, the woman accused 2 youths of gang rape in Dwarka South Police Station
 uske bayaan ke mutabik ladakon ne pehle cold drink main vodaka milakar pilaai
 But later she turned away from her statements and made stories
 baad main usne kubula ki usne jhooth bolaa tha
 The very next day he wrote a letter to the SHO of Dwarka South Police Station that he had not been molested
 balki wo zyada sharaab pine ke baad nashe main thi to aise main un donon ladakon ne jab use ghar drops karne se inkaar kiya, to usne unhen sabak sikhaane ke liye jhootha aarope lagaaya
 Directed by Anurag Basu, Disney and Picture Start Production's Jagga Jasoos is releasing on July 14, 2017
 is film ke superhit hone kii ummid kar rahe ranbir kapur is film se produsar bhi ban rahe hai
 ranbir-katrina fans have had to wait a long time for 'jagga Jasoos' as the film is releasing after a long time of 3 years
 anuraag basu dwaara nirdeshit, dizani or pikchar shuru production kii jagga jasoos 14 july 2017 ko relies ho rahi he
 Ranbir Kapoor, who is hoping to be a super hit of this film, is also becoming a producer with this film
 'jagga jasoos' ke liye ranbir-katrina ke phans ko lanbaa intjaar karnaa padaa he kyonki yah film 3 saalon ke lambey samay ke baad relies ho rahi he
 The biggest thing that has come out of the exit poll, prepared to take the vote of those who voted in Delhi elections, is for the Congress
 yah thappa us par lag gaya he ki jahaan uskaa alaakaman rahata he, vahiin uskaa koi vajood nahin he
 This party, which won eight seats in the last election, is now expected to win at least three seats
 to iskaa matlab kya he-1
 Congress supporters have also accepted that if anyone can stop the BJP, it is not the Congress but the Aam Aadmi Party
 aise main uskaa paramparaagat vot bhi AAP ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 2
 sonia or rahul ab shunya ho gaye hai
 During campaigning, he called for old works, but his failures showed such effect that the support for Congress was further reduced
 sonia or rahul ne to apane naam par vot maangana band hi kar diya he
 3
 gandhi parivaar ke najdiki ajay maakan ko is baar dilli chunaav kaa netritv saunpa gaya
 But despite his clear image, he could not do anything
 shila sarkaar ke khilaaf vaala gussa to ab nahin rahaa, lekin congress ke paksh main vot or kam ho gaye
 Congress got 25 percent votes in the last election, this time only 15 percent votes are expected
 4
 The voters' attitude towards the Congress has become such, as if a single vote was given to it, it would go in vain
 chanakya ke agsit pole ke mutabik to congress ko ek bhi seat nahin mil rahi he
 If this is true then this would be the biggest example of dusting a national party from the public
 5
 Finally and most importantly
 lagaataar haar ke baad sabase badi fajihat congress pravaktaaon kii hoti rahi he
 But now they too have adapted themselves to this environment
 ab ve congress kii baat hi nahin kar rahe hai
 Only criticizing AAP and BJP, as they both do against each other
 6
 Neither the AAP nor the BJP is ready to accept the exit poll results
 donon hi apni siten or zyada aane kii baat kar rahe hai
 It is only the Congress, whose leaders have no objection even if they are given zero seats
 maano ve maanakar chal rahe hai ki party to matiamet ho chuki

 bataa den, arabiai ke niyam ke mutabik atm graahak ko har maheene 5 tranjaction ke liye shulk nahin dena padataa he, lekin isse upar yani chathe tranjaction par bank charge vasuulata he
 RBI also clarified that non-cash transactions such as balance checks, fund transfers should also not be considered as ATM transactions, that is, this step of RBI is going to bring great relief to ATM customers

 When there are more than one billion people living in India, such as in India, any emptiness fills up fast, whether it be the leaders or the nobles, the rage or the wealth, the victor or the villain, bravery or cowardice, fame Or bloodshed, fatah or suffering — regardless of which one is born

 For a news magazine like India Today, this is the present opportunity to identify individual personalities

 Shaktiyyats who forged their year-end with their successes or weaknesses

 Even when the post-demonetisation tremors were felt throughout the economy, Modi firmly entrenched the country's largest post-independence tax reform, that is, the Goods and Services Tax

 For some time, however, GST proved neither good nor easy, which the Prime Minister promised to do
 kaarobaar, khaskar chote or majhole udhyam, tanon kagaji karrwai ke boj se dab gaye or bahut saare slab ke jhanjhaton main funskar rah gaye
 Such slabs which exceeded the limits of inanity in the case of some objects

 However, the people of India, especially those in the states where the elections to the legislative assembly were held, were seen stamping on these programs of the Prime Minister and his party BJP
 march main modi or unke kareebi saathi, party mukhiya amit shah ne uttar pradesh main apni party ko haroonges jeet dilaai or desh ke sabase zyada aabaadi vaale soobe main do-tihaai bahumat hasil kiya
 Presenting yet another unique example of their non-traditional style of leadership, this ecstatic duo chose a yogi who is far more known for his stubborn saffron views than the administrative efficiency expected of a chief minister

 Meanwhile, modi-shah's caravan appeared to be moving unbeatable in six of the remaining states that went to the polls during the year, either by winning elections or by establishing BJP governments in other ways

 In an exclusive interview to India Today, Raymond answered many questions on the india-us business relationship to Trump's visit to India
 bharat-america ke vyapaarik rishton pararemund ne kaha ki bharat or america duniya ke do mahaan loktantr hai, jinhen majboot sahyogi hona chahie
 However, economic connectivity is very important for this
 lekin durbhagyavash, america raashtrapatidonald trumpaise protsaahit karne ke icchhuk nahin dikhte
 He said that you speak of strong cooperation on the one hand and at the same time do important things from India's point of view, the ban on Iranian oil and the defense deal with Russia, it cannot go along
 remand ne kaha ki aap ye tark nahin de sakate ki aap apni steel industry ko bachaane ke liye tarriff laga rahe phir duusare deshon par pratibandh thope rahe

 aise main sabase ahm sawaal he ki S-400 missile system ke bare main raashtrapati kya faisla lete hai, kyonki ve isse naakhush the
 Raymond said that i think India can get an exemption
 aisa sochna ki bharat america ko khush karne ke liye sabhi deshon se apane sambandhon ko tod legaa, vaastaviktaa se pare he
 If the Russian missile system S-400 is not discounted, Raymond said that it would be a big shock if India did not give the US a discount on the S-400 deal
 unhone kaha ki pratibandhon ko bharat par puri tarah thopanaa america ke liye behad nuksaandeh sabit hoga
 However he hoped that nothing like this would happen and India would get a waiver after the final review
 chabahaar bandargah pararemund ne kaha ki bharat or america ke rishte main urja ek mahatvapurn bindu he
 Raymond said that today America is number one in the world in terms of hydro-carbon, petroleum and natural gas production
 isliye america ke liye bharat main zyada vyavsaayik sambhaavnaaen hai
 So if America is arbitrary it will only harm it

 More Russian weapons than American: Republic Day parade in India will showcase more Russian weapons than America
 aise main kya trump prashasan isi vajah se bharat daure ko manjuuri dene main jhijak rahaa he, is sawaal par remand ne kaha ki nishchit rup se yah badi samasya he
 Because nothing can be said about what Trump will feel by seeing Russia's weapons exhibition more than the US in the parade, but it is also true that in the last few years, the US and India Mendefence deal has reached $ 16 billion

 In this rally, Akhilesh fiercely raised the issue of demonetisation
 yadav ne chunavi sabha main sawalia lahaze main poocha ki 2000 rupee kaa note kaisaa he? aisa bura rupaya hamane kabhi nahi dekha
 2000 rupees is also at least we would have asked the socialists how to print a 2000 rupee note

 global times ne kaha ki jab saal 2006 main uttar korea ne pehali baar parmaanu pareekshan kiya tha, tabhi se america ke saath uski jubaani jang jari he
 North Korea is retaliating against every threat from the US
 itnaa hi nahin, usne is dauraan ne behatar parmaanu or missile takanic bhi viksit kar lee he

 Karthik also divorces Vedika in the show
 haalanki shuruyaat main karthik ke talaak ke baad goyanka family main naaraazgi thi, lekin dhire-dhire sab normal ho gaya
 Shivangi and Mohsen are dating each other in real life
 donon ke onscreen or ofscreen naam se kai saare fanclub hai
 The show's stance is now romantic as karthik-naira will once again tie the knot
 raat ke samay samudr tal se kuch hajaar foot upar se main bharat ke shaharon kii damakati roshni dekhtaa hum
 About one-third of the population in this country of seven lakh villages now lives in about 8,000 cities and towns
 jamini str par bhi bharat ke shaharon or kasbon kii tarah-tarah kii kahaniyaan sunne ke liye shrota milane lage hai
 Some stories look different
 hamaara trephic jam, pine ke pani or safai ke mudde, hamaare beghar or jan sevaayen paane kii jaddojahad main lage nirih naagarik, shahar main behatar bhavishya ke sapane or vahaan tak pahunchane kaa sangharsh, mushkilon bharaa ek din
 The nuances of urban policy are not visible in the everyday, but are extremely important
 lagaataar mahangi hoti jameen, kam keemat ke bheetar makaan paane ke maukon par shikanja kas leti he
 Empowering urban local bodies is still far-fetched
 hamane kalpana nahin kii he ki hamaare shahar kya rup le sakate hai—rahan-sahan kii jeevant vyavasthaaen, jahaan arthvyavasthaaen logon ke dam par chalati hai, menuphaccharing or sevaaon ke centre, nae vichaaron ko ankurit karne vaali jameen, aisi jagah jahaan log maukon kii talash main aa saken
 Our city stands at the crossroads in this Indian story of indiscriminate competition
 sambhaavnaaen or akanhnaayen asaadhya chunautiyon ke havan kunda banakar shahar ke vichaar se takaraa rahi hai
 Despite all the stories of settling in real India villages, the journey of many national leaders of India has started in the urban environment
 1947 main aaazaad bharat main gaanvon kaa bolbalaa tha
 Gandhi's concept of cities was also a product of colonial experience
 aupniveshik shahar apane mul nivasee or chhavnee vaale ilaakon ke saath shaasha ko shasit se alag karata tha
 Nehru tried to create a completely different dream of a modern Indian city, cut from the past and created new state capitals for this
 ambedkar kii najar main gaanv haashie par jite logon ke liye shoshan ke thikaane the or vah ek vaikalpik drushti thi
 The imagination of the city is still exiled from politics, although the state capitals, economic centers, expensive land and property, political and bureaucratic centers are all in the cities
 do stareey sangheey vyavastha main sthaneey swashaasan kahin peeche khadaa rah gaya tha
 In this, urbanization was considered a 'problem' and migration from village to cities symbolized the failure of development of villages
 shahari sansthaaon kaa kissa yah he ki 1993 main sthaneey nikaayon se sambandhit 74wein sanshodhan ke baavjood shahari vikaas kaa kaamkaaj kaaphi sust chal rahi he kyonki unke paas sansaadhan, satta or rajnatik gunjaaish bahut kam he
 The symbolic roots of the chasm between the village and the city are also hidden in the vote, where citizens of the cities are considered a divided political bloc, lacking the collective power of political bargaining, such as factionalism based on the caste, religion and identity of the villages
 yah or baat he ki mahanagareey shahari bharat ke siddhant kaa saamana aaj sankeern pahchaan se jude laabhon ke liye dhakka-mukki karte vibhinn guton se he jo samvidhan kii sankalpana ko taar-taar karne par utaaru hai
 With the new Directional Plan of urban politics, the thinking of the urban society began to infiltrate the policy, which led to some problems in the economic sheet of the country
 samvidhan kaa 74waan sanshodhan ek aisa ahm mode tha, jahaan vikendrikaran kii bhaavana ke liye aas-pados se lekar mahanagareey str tak sanvaidhanik prashasan ke buniyadi tatwon par gaur karnaa jaruri ho gaya
 The Administrative Reform Commission advocated decentralization
 isi tarah 2011 main ucchadhikaar praapt visheshgy samiti ne dhan, kriyalap or padaadhikariyon ke tihare shikanje ko dhilaa karne kii koshish kii
 The 13th Finance Commission recommended a drastic increase in allocation and proposed a Goods and Services Tax (GST) so that urban self-government could get more money
 jawaharlal nehru shahari naveekaran mishan (jeenenyuarem) shaayad duniya main shaharon ke liye mishan aadhaarit sabase badi pahal he, jisane shahari vikaas main vittiya protsaahanon ko shaamil kiya he
 More cities can be included in the second proposed phase of this mission
 investment or aarthik vruddhi kii pehali shart ke rup main shahari buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar kii aavashyaktaa ko manyata milane lagi he
 There are also huge drawbacks of urban generation
 agar bharat ke shaharon ko or gahare sankat ke bhavar main funsane se bachaana he to shaharon kii nai sire se sankalpana sirf aarthik hi nahin, rajnatik jarurat bhi he
 Most political parties and groups are considering this possibility
 ek to, der se hi sahi shaharon ko rajnatik vot bank mana jane laga he
 Recent demonstrations in urban centers have proved that the political tone of the cities is now becoming vocal
 yah to bhavishya batayega ki kya ye vastav main 1991 ke baad kii shahari bhartiya peedi ke liye jag jane kaa nirnaayak pal tha
 We do not have elected representatives with executive powers such as New York, Buenos Aires, Tokyo and London who can change the functioning and working style of their cities
 nirvachan kshetron ke parisemen ke baavjood loksabhaa kii vartmaan sadsy sankhya badhati shahari aabaadi ke anupaat main nahin he, phir bhi badlaav to dhire-dhire aayega, lekin jarur aayega
 Now these questions are constantly being asked what is the meaning of freedom and dignity in the cities of India and for whom
 is sawaal kaa jawaab to dena hi hoga
 Secondly, the traditional concept of 'rural-urban' is increasingly being challenged in the changing countryside, development of large villages, expanding areas around cities and the number of census towns
 shaharon main jamaavada bad rahaa he, phir bhi bharat kaa bada hissaa gaanvon main hi rahata rahegaa
 We can envision new possibilities of decentralized rural-urban solidarity, given the scarcity of resources, unavailability of land, limitations of water, electricity and ecology and advancement in technology
 iske liye kalyankari rajya kii jarurat hogi jo gramin or shahari ichchhaaon ke saath khud ko behatar dhang se jod sake
 Third, our cities will have to improve services, especially for the poor, children, helpless, women, elderly and many types of disabled people
 kam kharchile makaan or swasthya seva, sabake liye pani, swatchta or thos kachare ke niptaan kii vyavastha, behatar shiksha, sthaayee kism ke rojgaar or udhyam shuru karne ke maukey, kargar saarvajanik parivahan vyavastha, bazaar main baraabar kii hissedari ke maukey, adhik sakriy prashasan—ye sab naitik or rajnatik donon drushtiyon se jaruri hai
 We have to create new forms of entrepreneurship that can increase the speed of electricity in protection of productivity, salary and livelihood
 ho saktaa he ki iske liye ek nayaa shahari aajeevika mishan bananaa pade jo shahari or gramin adhikaron main saamanjasy laa sake
 However, China has not been able to think about it yet
 2050 ke bharat kii taiyarichautha, drawing board par saaf-suthere paimaane se ukeri gai vishalkay jagah ke rup main shahar kii yojana banane kii aupniveshik soch ab bharat ke shaharon kii pahchaan ban chuki aarthik, saamaajik or rajnatik shaktiyon kii paraspar gunthi gaatha main kisi kaam kii nahin he
 As the economy grows and cities with a population of more than 7-8 crore develop, the challenges emerging from them will upset the traditional thinking town planners, as these challenges will not come alone
 maanav vikaas or suraksha, jalwaayu parivartan or sankramak rog sahit kal kii sachaaiyon se nibatane ke liye ye rajnatik samaj paidaa kerani hogi ki hamaare shaharon main log kaise jite hai? 1811 main dizin kiya gaya manahattan grid vakït kii kasuti par khara utraa he—motor vaahan, central park, fibre optics, hamen bhavishya ke liye dizin kii gai aisi shahari sanrachanaon kii jarurat he
 Fifth, urban change will have to adapt to the challenges of expansion
 nagarpalikaon or anya sansthaaon ko do dashak se bhi kam samay main iske liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Investing billions is needed to overcome decades of neglect
 puraane pad chuke kanoonon ko hataanaa hoga
 Large-scale distortions in the land market will have to be removed and it will be effectively connected to labor market, transportation system, housing, electricity and other public services
 ek samasya or he jisaki andekhi kii gai he
 The problem is to raise the right people who understand India's urbanization in their own contexts and do not copy North America or East Asia at all
 kal kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan vahi log kar sakate hai jinke paas vibhinn kshetron kii samgr samaj ho: arthshaastra, niyojan, kanoon, tikaaupan, dizin, technology, samaaj kii sanrachana or itihaas ityadi
 In order to train these professional people, institutions related to various disciplines of the most advanced level at national level are needed
 indian institute for human setlements is mishan ko sanbhaalane ke liye ek aise hi sambhavit vishvavidhyalay kaa rup le saktaa he
 In such an interesting period, there will be political upheaval
 loktantr satta main baithe logon ko sahi samay main sambhaavnaaon par nae sire se sochane kii chunauti detaa he
 Young leaders know that the India of 2050 will look very different from today's India
 bharat kii vibhinn shahari sachaaiyon, ateet or vartmaan kii hakeekat ko samajhne kii chunauti thodi mushkil to he lekin romaanchak bhi kam nahin he
 How to meet the need of continuous growth at the national level without losing contact with the individual, from the local level and daily life, this is especially the Indian challenge

 bollywood kii diggaj abhinetri rekha (rekha) kaa aaj 65waan janmdin he

 shatrughna sinha ne is twit main likhaa: "vah naa sirf apana janmdin meri patni ke saath share karti hai, balki hamaare home production kii film 'aaj phir jeene kii tamanna he' main utkrisht or shandaar pradarshan bhi kiya he, lekin abhi ye film relies nahin ho pai he

 us film main vah bal kalakaar thim

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chunavi raily shuru ho gai he
 On Thursday, PM Modi addressed the rally in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki jameen ho, aasmaan ho yaa antariksh, sargical strike kaa saahas aapke chaukeedaar kii sarkaar ne dikhaaya he
 PM Narendra Modi said that on the one hand there are the rites of New India and on the other side there is the expansion of dynasty and corruption
 aaj ek taraf vikaas kaa thos aadhaar he, duusari taraf na niti he, na vichaar he or na hi niyat he
 On the one hand there is a decision-making government, on the other there is a history of postponing decisions for decades
 rudrapur raily ke dauraan piem narendra modi ne kaha ki congress ne purv sainikon ko varshon tak dhokhe main rakhaa
 One Rank One Pension was hanged
 inhone van rank van pension ke naam par sirf 500 karod kaa bajet rakhaa tha
 Our government approved the One Rank One Pension and transferred 35,000 crore rupees to the soldiers
 piem narendra modi ne kaha ki congress ke ragadrabari kehete hai ki modi ko air strike kii baat nahin kerani chahie, modi ko desh kii suraksha kaa mudda nahin uthaanaa chahie
 Should Modi sit quietly? Should Modi be scared of terrorists? Fearful rites are not in your watchman
 pakistan kaa hero banane kii chahat main bharat virdohi bayaan dene waalon ko kya desh kii janata maaf karegi?piem narendra modi ne kaha ki uttarakhand bharat kii sundar paribhaasha jaisaa he
 Here is Ganges, Yamuna
 bhagirathi se sangam ko aatur alaknanda he, panchkedaar he or badri-kedaar milaayein to chaar dham banate hai
 i add the fifth dham to this - Sainik Dham
 sainik dham ke logon se main poochna chahta hum
 Was it right to question the valor of our brave soldiers after the surgical strike? When the terrorists were killed by entering the house, it was right to ask such questions on the brave soldiers, was it correct to call the Chief of Army a liar? 
 ye congress ke jhooth kaa, soch kaa or uski asafalataa kaa sabase bada saboot he
 The Congress, which traitors the poor for 70 years, can never think of the poor
 isliye aaj desh kaa garib bhi kah rahaa he ki garibi hataane ke liye congress ko hataanaa jaruri he
 Congress is the cause of poverty
 rudrapur main raily se pehle piem narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke meerut main raily ko sambodhit kiya

 swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay ne guuruuvaar ko 80 epadisi (fiks dose combinaton) dawaaon par tatkaal prabhaav se pabandi laga di he
 Earlier, in September 2018, the government banned 325 FDC medicines

 Actually, 'fix dose combination' drugs include doses of 2 or more drugs in a fixed proportion
 centre sarkaar ke swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay dwaara apasidi par pabandi lagane kaa yah pehla maamla nahin he
 Even before this, the government has banned FCD in large numbers many times
 mantralay ne beete sitambar main 325 par pabandi lagane ke saath-saath kuch sharton ko lagaate hue 6 epadisi ke utpaadan, bikri athwa vitaran ko bhi pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Such a large number of drugs were banned by the government for the first time since 2016

 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki kuch log shuddh rup se ek vaakya bhale hi na likh paaen, lekin bolne main ve koi ashuddhi nahin karte hai
 This is because the brain has different systems for writing and speaking
 ek nae adhyayan main is baat kaa khulaasa hua he
 Brenda Rapp, professor and chief researcher at John Hopkins University in the United States, said, "any other word to say by someone, while using another word to write was very shocking
" hamen isaki ummid nahin thi ki ve likhane va bolne ke liye vibhinn shabdon kaa istemaal karenge
 'rap said,' it's like the brain has two semi-independent language systems
 ' shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki aisa sambhav he ki mastishk kaa bolne vaala hissaa kshatigrast ho jaae, lekin likhane vaala hissaa aprabhavit rahe
 The research team conducted a study on five victims of stroke with difficulty speaking
 inamen se chaar logon ko vaakyon ko likhane main pareshaani aa rahi thi, jabaki usee vaakya ko bolne main unhen koi khaas samasya pesh nahin aa rahi thi
 The last person's problem was averted
 use bolne main dikkat aa rahi thi, lekin vah dhadlle se likh paa rahaa tha
 In conclusion, it was revealed that even though the ability of human to write is developed by the ability to speak, the process of writing and speaking is driven by different parts of the brain

 Kamal Haasan, head of Makkal Nidhi Mayyam, said that English had become the common language of the country
 unhone kaha ki haalanki ye anaupchaarik tareeke se hua he lekin angreji desh kii saamaanya bhashaa ban gai he
 Kamal Haasan's statement came after actor Rajinikanth's statement that a common language is needed for the development of the country
 rajnikant ne bhi hindi bhashaa thopane kii koshishon kaa virodh kiya tha or kaha tha ki hindi hi nahin kisi bhashaa ko desh par thopa nahin janaa chahie
 Kamal Haasan said that he has been learning other languages as well

 He said that the suggestion of others about the language is acceptable, but if someone tamper with the position of their mother tongue, they will not tolerate it

 We respect all languages, but our mother tongue will always be Tamil

 The story is that some Muslim families have been living in the medias built around this ancient Mahakaleshwar temple for the last three generations
 maharani lakshmibai or unke senapati gulam gaus khan kii koshishon se kaayam hui kaumi ekta ab tak chali aa rahi thi
 This temple was built 600 years ago by the Guasians in Madia Mohalla located at Govind Crossroads
 rajasav abhilekhon main mandir kaa rakabaa kareeb 16 acre bataaya gaya he
 But now there is only temple
 aazaadee ke samay jab desh kaa vibhaajan hua to bantwaare kii bhagdad main kuch hindu pariwaron ne apane muslim doston ko mandir main sharan dekar pakistan nahin jane diya
 Since then these families started living as tenants in the Shiva temple
 kabhi kisi ne is par koi etraj bhi nahin kiya, jab tak siyasat ke logon ne ise mudda nahin banaaya
 Recently these Muslim families were shifted to Kanshi Ram Colony by giving them housing and financial assistance
 is tarah raajnneeti main dharm kii rotiyaan senk rahe logon ke haathon se sarkaar ne mudda hi chin liya
 Mahakaleshwar was the first such large temple in the state, where there was no dispute like Ayodhya, Mathura or Kashi
 lekin bijepi netaaon ne yahaan rah rahe musalamaanon ko mudda banaakar voton kaa dhruvikaran karnaa shuru kiya
 BJP, losing its base, won the election of first MLA and then Mayor by airing this issue
 iske baad loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bijepi ko badi safalataa mili
 Now every year on the last Monday of Shiva procession and Sawan, mass Gangabhishek program was announced on Shivalinga and tension started to build up

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav entrusted the responsibility of stopping the confrontation to the DM of Jhansi, but no way could be worked out by agreeing both sides

" lekin hamane yah kar dikhaaya
 For this we first talked to political people and then to each family living in the temple
