 If you are a student of Hindi medium and in a question paper, if you find words like Dutt instead of data, Samasti instead of population, Sugatya instead of plastic, Adhayayi instead of basic, will you not be shocked? Can you understand the questions in a limited time and answer them correctly? Probably not
 magar, sangh lok seva ayog (upiessi) pichley kuch varshon se iees-ipies sahit do darjan sevaaon ke liye yojit hone vaali civil services pariksha ke prashnpatron main aisi hi hindi kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 Which is called Hindi with Google translation
 kaha ja rahaa he ki mul prashnptr angreji main taiyaar karne ke baad paper setre google transleshan main daalate hai
 By distorting what comes, we write the Hindi translation question under English
 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) kii ore se shiksha kshetra main kaam karne vaale trust shiksha sanskrit utthan nyaas ne is maamle ko uthaate hue sahi anuwaad kii maang kii he
 Its proposal was prepared on 18 August, which is set to be sent to the central government
 maang he ki civil services kii parikshaon ke mul prashn patr hindi main taiyaar hon
 So that the problem of incorrect translation from English will not come
 varsh 2010 ke baad se civil services pariksha ke prashn patron main google transleshan vaali hindi ke prayog se ummidavaar hi nahin, jane-maane hindi prophessoron kaa bhi sir chakra jaataa he
 Candidates say that the availability of low content in Hindi and other Indian languages, on the one hand, creates difficulties for them
 duusari taraf upiessi kii kharaab hindi kodh main khaaj kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Vikas Divyakirti Tanj, who coached Civil Services for Hindi Medium students on this situation, says, "it seems that there is a translation of Hindi from Mars
 "yun to hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke chaatro ke desh kii sarvocch pariksha main pichad jane ke peeche or kai thos vajahen hai
 But the issue of poor Hindi translation is important
 aankade bataate hai ki bhartiya bhashaaon main chaatro kii safalataa kaa pratishat mahaj nau se das pratishat rah gaya he
 Till 2008, Hindi students were successful in making it to the top 20 rank
 2002 main to paanchavin, aathvin or dasvin rank par hindi medium chaatro kaa kabja tha
 But since 2010, the percentage of success of Hindi speaking students has fallen
 2017-18 kii pariksha main top 25 main hindi yaa anya kisi kshetreey bhashaa kaa ek bhi abhyarthi jagah nahin bana paaya
 The issue arose in front of Mohan Bhagwat In the presence of Mohan Bhagwat, Sarsanghchalak of the Sangh in New Delhi, on August 18, the issue of poor translation of Hindi and other Indian languages also came up in a seminar called Competitive examinations-national Subject in India
 yah aayojan sangh se jude shiksha sanskrit utthan nyaas ne kiya tha
 a book written by the National Convenor of the Competitive Examination Project, constituted by the Trust, Devendra Singh - Administrative Services Examinations in India: Union Chief Bhagwat released Myth and Reality
 is dauraan kharaab hindi anuwaad ko lekar carmik mantralay or sangh lok seva ayog ko prastaav bhejne kaa faisla hua
 There is no understanding of such Hindi, in the examinations of the Civil Services exam, in Hindi questions, such words - Sahayya instead of subsidy, Baruthi instead of Termite, meaning is the prevalent word, but in its place Prithvikal was used
 isi tarah vaak pahchaan yaa shinaakht kii vaak abhigyaan, vaishvikaran kii jagah vishwa vyapeekaran, aadharbhoot kii jagah adhashayi, sankalpana kii jagah sampratyikaran jaise na samaj main aane vaale shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 Not only Hindi, but also Indian national convenor Devendra Singh aajtak
 in se kaha ki jab bhi kharaab hindi anuwaad kaa masalaa uthta he to kuch angreji maansikta vaale buddhijivi kehete hai," are isamen kya he, yadi hindi samaj nahin aa rahi he to angreji kaa sawaal dekh lo
 If you do not know that much English, will you become an IAS? " devendra singh kehete hai ki sawaal hindi-angreji jaanane kaa nahin, balki upiessi ke aksham anuvaadakon dwaara kiye gaye galat anuwaad ko sudhaarney or hindi se angreji or angreji se hindi karne main hi pariksha kaa amuly samay nasht karne kaa he
 Is the Union Public Service Commission so incompetent that it cannot translate even ten lines properly
 devendra singh kehete hai ki 120 minute kii samay seemaa main abhyarthi pehle galat hindi padhein or na samaj main aane par phir angreji main sawaal padhein to phir ayog kii galtiyaan sudhaaren or phir sawaal kaa uchit jawaab sochen
 In a test that has the importance of one minute and where the marks are fixed in decimal, it is not discriminatory for the contestants to be distracted by putting the burden of poor translation on their heads? Devendra Singh says that if it is being said that Hindi is not understood If i see English then it means that the system itself is accepting the Hindi translation flaw
 agar hindi chaatro kii angreji itani hi acchhee ho to ve sidhe angreji madhyam na chun len
 Devendra Singh says that due to lack of proper translation of a few lines, only a whole class of students is left out of the competitive examination
 jeenyu or diu ke professor likh chuke hai patrabharat main prashasnic seva parikshaayen myth evam yatharth pustak main upiessi kii pariksha main kharaab hindi anuwaad ko lekar do hindi praadhyaapakon ke patr kaa bhi zikr he
 Pandey, former president of the Indian Language Center, Jawaharlal Nehru University, has written a letter to the Union Public Service Commission and Minister of State for Personnel, "I have been a teacher of Hindi at the Indian Language Center of Jawaharlal Nehru University for over 30 years
 
 aapke prashn patr -1 or 2 main jo hindi anuwaad hai, unako samajhnaa mere liye bhi mushkil hi nahin asambhav he
 In such a situation, how can the candidates understand those Hindi translations
 prashn patr 1 or 2 ke hindi anuwaadon se parikshaarthiyon ko to nuksaan ho hi rahaa he or hindi bhashaa kaa bhi naash ho rahaa he
 On the contrary, the Hindi translation in the question paper of your examination is hardly understood by any Sanskrit pundit, but ordinary people, teachers and students cannot understand it
 "vahiin 2014 ke prashnptr ko lekar dilli uniwarsity ke professor apurvanand ne upiessi adhyaksh ko likhe patr main kaha tha-main ucch str par hindi kaa adhyaapan karata hum or shodh tathaa lekhan kaary main sanlagn hum, jo hindi lok seva ayog apane prashn-patron main prayog kar rahaa he, use samajhnaa mere liye tedi kheer he, main samaj saktaa hum ki pariksha dete hue hindi madhyam ke ummidavaaron ko inkaa arth samajhane main hi chakke chhot jaaenge, uttar dena to dur kii baat he
 Use of this type of language is definitely an injustice to the candidates of Hindi medium, in the selection made on the basis of this, they will be at a disadvantage compared to the candidates of English medium
 "purushottam agarwal cameti kii siforeeshon par amal nahinmul prashnptr angreji main taiyaar kar uskaa hindi yaa anya bhartiya bhashaaon main galat transleshan ke mudde par sangh lok seva ayog kii ore se purushottam agarwal cameti gathit kar chukaa he
 This committee gave its opinion on several points
 pehla bindu kaaphi ahm tha
 In which it was said that the committee believes that the question papers should be examined by senior academics who have expertise in Hindi, they have experience in teaching and translation in their career
 cameti kii siforeeshon ko padhane se yah lagata he ki anuwaadon ko varisht shikshavidon se jaanch nahin karaayaa jaataa
 Former law minister of the UPA government Hans Raj Bhardwaj made a sensational disclosure, saying that in 2005, the Supreme Court was pressurized by the Supreme Court to get the Bihar government to validate President's rule

 At that time, the UPA government had adopted such a strategy to prevent the JDU-BJP coalition government from coming to power in Bihar

 He was also the chairman of the constitution bench which was hearing the case
 ' haalankiupie sarkaar kii sari koshishennakam raheen or faisla uske paksh main nahin aayaa
 During the hearing, 3 out of 5 judges of the Bench pronounced the decision against the government, terming the move as a misuse of section 356 of the President's Rule
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki tatkaaleen chif justise vaai ke sabharwal unke paariwarik mitra the or usulon ke pakke the
 Therefore, he could not muster the courage to say anything in this regard
 'mantri pad jane kaa dikhaaya gaya tha dar'ek kaarykram ke dauraan bharadwaj ne kaha ki jab faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di gai to saath hi unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki agar faislasarkaar ke paksh mennhin aayaa to unka mantri pad chin liya jayega

 This year's Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Liu, a leader who struggled against the government for the restoration of democracy in China
 liyu ne lambey samay tak china main loktantr bahaali ke liye andolan chalaaya he or tabhi se ve jail main band hai
 Liu had helped prepare and broadcast Charter 08
 yah charter china main vyapak raajnneetik or dharmik badlaav kaa pakshdhar he
 Liu is accused of making Charter 08
 is charter main unhone china main raajnneetik badlaav kii vakaalat kii he
 Liu has always said that political changes should be brought about in a peaceful manner
 liyu kii sajaa kaa kai desh or sansthaaon ne virodh kiya tha
 The European Union including America, Canada, Switzerland, Taiwan etc
 have appealed to release him but the Chinese government termed it as interference in their internal matter
 liyu china main raajnneetik or dharmik badlaav ke pakshdhar rahe hai
 He was placed into custody on 8 December 2008 and arrested on 23 June 2009

 bharat ne yun to melbern cricket ground par 10 main se do test match main jeet darj kii, lekin jab se is aitihaasik maidan par baxing de yani 26 disambar se maichon kii shuruyaat hone lagi tab se bhartiya team ko adhiktar avasaron par haar kaa hi saamana karnaa padaa
 Not only Melbourne, overall, India's record in Test matches started on Boxing Day has not been good
 bhartiya team ne ab tak aise10 test match khele hai jo 26 disambar se shuru hue
 In seven of these matches, he lost while only one match was won
 baaki do match drow rahe
 It can be said that India has broken the myth of not winning on Boxing Day, but not on Australian soil
 bharat ne thik ek saal pehle 26 disambar, 2010 ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf durban main shuru hue test match main 87 ran se jeet darj kii thi
 In Australia, however, the Boxing Day Test match has a different significance
 australia kii team pichley kai varshon se apane desh kaa daura karne vaali team ke khilaaf 26 disambar se melbern main test match khelti rahi
 Hence Boxing Day has a special relationship with Australia and Melbourne
 bharat ne pehali baar 1985 main kapil dev kii captaini main melbern main boxing de test match khelaa tha
 India had the target of scoring 126 runs in 25 overs in this second match of the series, but could only manage 59 runs for two wickets
 yah match drow ho gaya tha
 It was the debut Test of former Australia captain Steve Waugh
 bhartiya team 1999 main jab melbern main khilne utari thi to tendulkar swayan captain the
 In this Brett Lee debut Test match, Tendulkar played a 116-run captaincy innings, but despite this India lost their second match of the series by 180 runs
 iske chaar saal baad 2003 main virendra sahvaag kii 195 ran kii pari bhi bharat ke kaam nahin ai thi or australia nau wicket se jeet darj karne main safal rahaa tha
 India played the second Test in 2007 in Melbourne on 26 December
 is match main bhartiya ballebaaj buree tarah asafal rahe or team ko 337 ran ke bade antar se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Now that Australia has less experienced bowlers, India have a golden chance to win a Boxing Day match
 boxing de par anya deshon ke khilaaf bharat ke pradarshan ko dekha jaae to usne 1987 main westeindies ke khilaaf teesraa test match drow khelaa tha
 He suffered a nine-wicket defeat against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1992 while against New Zealand in 1998 by four wickets at Wellington
 bhartiya team ne 2006 main durban main dakshin africa se boxing de par doosraa test match khelaa tha, lekin vah 174 ran se haar gai thi
 But on 26 December 2010, India was successful in breaking the order of defeat in the Boxing Day match by VVS Laxman's attractive innings of 96 runs last year
 inamen se pehle match main bhagavat chandrashekhar ne 12 wicket liye to gavaskar ne duusari pari main 118 ran banaae, jabaki 1981 ke match main gundappa vishwanath ne shatak lagaaya or kapil dev ne duusari pari main paanch wicket liye the
 Australia have played 103 Test matches in Melbourne so far, of which they have won 58, while 30 have lost
 vaise australia ne is maidan par boxing de par jo pichley teen match main khele hai, unamem se do main use haar jhelni padi he
 He lost to South Africa in 2008, while in 2010 England defeated him by an innings and 157 runs

 When i look into my memories, there are some such pictures of domestic violence and suffering, which are too scary to remember
 mere dimag main saalon pehle kii gai sabhi baaten ek baar phir doharaai jaati hai
 One day my grandfather saw me smiling and prayed that i should get married in a good house and my condition should not be like a firefly
 jab maine unase is baat kaa matlab poocha, to ve khala ke shuhar ke bare main bhala-bura kehane lage
 a Pir ruined the life of Jugnu, when Grandpa did not live in the world, then one day my father, Abbu Jugnu began to spoil the taste of Khala and my mother indicated to him to keep quiet
 abbu ne ammi kii baat na maanate hue kaha ki jugnu kii jindagi us pir ne barbaad kar di
 His husband, who wanted to make Jugnu submissive in his own way, took him to a Pir
 us pir ne khala kaa khaanaa band kara diya or khala ke saath kabristaan main sambandh banane kii salaah de daali
 Khala's mad husband made him angry at the cemetery, but Khala could not become a 'better begum' of the husband
 ek hafte tak pir ke paas rahi jugnukhaala ke shuhar ko shant karne ke liye pir ne jugnu khala ko ek hafte tak khud ke paas chhodane ko kaha or khala ke shuhar aisa karne ke liye maan bhi gaye
 a week later, Jugnu Khala had become a 'better begum' according to his husband, with whom he could do anything
 doctoron kii bhashaa main khaladipressanaki shikaar ho chuki thi
 Khala's condition worsened when the family also refused to help him
 yah baat parivaar main hi rahe isliye baahar in baton kaa kisi ko pataa nahin chalane diya gaya
 Khalam had run away from home when i was five years old, when my firefly Khala had run away from her house
 khala kii haalat itani kharaab thi ki wo sidhaa khadi bhi nahin ho paa rahi thi or unka sharir pilaa pad chukaa tha
 The people of the house somehow put her on the bed and she fainted
 achaanak khala 'baba-baba' kahkar chillane lagi or baba ke paas unhen naa le jane kii baat kahkar rone rahi thi
 Everyone told them that there is no Baba there
 meri khala ne jab mujhe dekha, to mere maathe ko chumkar meri maa se hameshaa meraa khyaal rakhane kaa vaada liya
 Khala was crying and her son of four was silently staring at her mother in this condition
 25 saalon baad khala se phir hui mulakatek paariwarik kaarykram main ham sab 25 saal baad phir mili or sab kuch badal chukaa tha
 My blanket came with her husband and three children
 ab wo do beton or ek beti kii maa ban chuki thi
 Khala had changed a lot, so much that i could not recognize him once
 khala ab bahut kam bolti thi
 There was swelling everywhere on her hands, feet and face and she looked pregnant for nine months, but it was not so
 kuch na kah saki khalajitne bhi log vahaan aae, sabane khala kaa haal poocha or wo sirf muskuraai
 Khala's husband was laughing loudly in the room and instructing Khala to take care of himself

 On my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “jaan”
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let’s be that
 Let's be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That’s what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough

 You talk of corruption of government people, but there are many people in the country who do not pay tax, steal tax extensively and adopt corrupt methods of every kind

 The political system, law and order, the entire structure and the people who run it should be such that no party comes to power, no one can betray the country

 So you will not make a political party? We are not running with any political or communal agenda

 But there is also talk of 100 percent voting in your agenda

 We want to see a system in 2014 in which skilled and honest people choose
 jo bhi chunakar aaen, desh ke saath gaddari nahin, nyaay karen
 i don't know who those people will be from different parties, how they will be
 main sirf itnaa jaanata hum ki ham teen saal main aisa vaataavaran bana denge ki kushal or eemaandaar log hi chunakar aaen
 You also said that you will form a party and you will be in the role of Chanakya

 ) 'aaj Tak' on Wednesday showed a sting operation regarding black marketing in the onion market in Madhya Pradesh
 is oparation kaa bada asar hua he
 Srikanth Soni, general manager (GM) of food supplies, has been arrested
 shivaraj sarkaar ne harakat main aate hue camere main kaid dallalon ke khilaaf cese darj karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The Chief Minister's Secretariat has ordered the MP Nagar police station to file a criminal case
 isse pehle shivaraj sarkaar ne rajya ke naagarik aapurti ke jiem ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Till date the camera captured the scam in the name of farmers in Madhya Pradesh
 sarkaar ne kisaanon se aath rupee main pyaaj kharida
 The auction was decided to sell that onion but the officials ate the commission and played it
 aath rupee kaa pyaajdo rupee main bik gaya or do rupee main bika hua byaaj phir se aath rupee vasuulne ke liye pahunch gaya
 The general manager of the state's food supply department turned out to be the biggest chieftain of Mandi's brokers
 wo aaj tak ke khufia camere par kamishan khaakar aath rupee vaala pyaaj sava do rupee main dilaane kii guarantee de rahe hai
 In this manner, they defrauded the government of crores and the brokers earned fiercely
 upaj kisaan kii or kharida sarkaar ne or karodon lut le gaye dalal
 That too with the kindness of the government
 maje kii baat ye ki sabakuch paardarshee tareeke se hua
 With purity across
 puri saavdhaanee barti gai ki pole na khule
 But when Aaj Tak saw the auction of intentions in the name of buying onions in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh, the layers of loot of the Sarakari treasury went off like this onion peel
 india today ke under cover reporter ne shahar ke paryaavas bhawan main sthit rajya naagarik aapurti vibhaag (MPSCSC) ke mukhyalay kaa rukh kiya
 Here, General Manager Shrikant Soni agreed to sell onion and a quarter of a train in exchange for a thick bribe
 soni camere par ye kehete hue kaid hua- 'nilaamee ko manage kar liya jayega
 i am saying that i will manage it in Shajapur, Maksi, and Shujalpur (mandis)
 'soni ne guarantee di ki antim boli 2 rupee prati kilo ke aadhaar mul se 10 paise se zyada hargiz nahin hogi
 Sony said, 'I 2 it
 10 rupee par fiks kar duungaa
 Let us see how easily 2
 10 rupee par manage ho jayega
 'sony first demanded from 3 lakh to 4 lakh rupees to manage everything, ie to give the auction a desirable appearance
 phir usne sthaneey adhikariyon ko 'fiks' karne ke naam par ek lakh rupee or kii maang kii
 This whole Gorakhdhandha was shown in a very planned manner
 iske liye vibhinn mandiyon main farji boli lagane vaale log bhi khadey kiye jate hai
 They are already understood not to bid more than the predetermined price
 aisa bhi kiya jaataa he ki saare utpaada ko hi kharaab kah kar khaarij kar diya jaae jisase pratispardhaatmak bikri kaa makasad hi naakaam ho jaae
 Villagers did not fire bullets in an encounter in June 2012 at Sarkeguda in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district
 is baat ke bhi saboot nahin mili hai ki is muthbhed main naksali shaamil the
 This was revealed by the judicial report of Justice VK Aggarwal who was involved in the investigation of the case
 san 2012 main 28-29 june ko hui is kathith muthbhed main suraksha bal ke javaanon ne 17 naksaliyon ke maare jane kaa daawa kiya tha
 Their bodies were also recovered
 is muthbhed kii jaanch ke liye jaanch ayog kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 The 78-page report has raised serious questions over claims by security forces
 is muthbhed ko tatkaaleen grahamantri pi chidambaram farji maanane ko taiyaar nahin the, lekin chhattisgarh congress adhyaksh nandkumar patel apni upie sarkaar or grahamantri chidambaram ke khilaaf uth khadey hue the
 The report of the one-member judicial commission said that the villagers were tortured and later shot at them from close quarters
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aisa lagata he ki surakshabalon ne hadabdaahat main firing kii
 a villager taken into custody was shot the following morning after an alleged encounter for several hours at night
 ukt paristhitiyon se yah anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki baithak ahaanikar nahin thi or beej pandum mahotsav kii vyavastha karne ke uddeshy se nahin bulaai gai thi, jaisaa ki shikayatakartaaon kii ore se daawa kiya gaya he
 While it is true that the people gathered at the meeting or those killed or injured from three villages - Sarkeguda, Kottaguda and Raj Penta, were Naxalites, this is not established in the records based on strong evidence
 haalanki unamem se kam se kam kuch logon kaa aapraadhik record tha jo ki record par maujuud sakshya se pataa lagata he
 "above mentioned



 record par maujuud paristhitiyon ko aankane par yah prathit hota he ki mritkon ke dhadon par jaise ki sir ke sheersh par goli se pataa chalata he ki unhen kareeb se goli maari gai he, or yah dur se firing kaa parinaam nahin ho saktaa he, jaisaa ki suraksha bal kaa kahana he
 Considering the above circumstances, including the nature and location of the gunshot injuries, it seems clear that the incident did not take place in the manner described by the opposite-party security forces
 yah bhi prathit hota he ki suraksha balon dwaara firing dur se nahin kii gai thi or na hi jab un par hamalaa hua, balki aisa prathit hota he ki suraksha balon ne baithak ke sadasyon ko dekha, unke paas gaye or phir kareeb se goliyaan chalaayin jiske kaaran kuch logon ke sir ke sheersh par, jabaki dusron ke dhad or peeth par goliyaan lagi
 In addition, members of the meeting were also assaulted, resulting in wounds on his body
 ye chotein (bullate kii choton ke alaava) keval kareeb se ho sakati hai- tej dhar vaale hathiyaaron se yaa kathor yaa bhothra (kunthit) wastu jaise bandook yaa rifl ke bat se ho sakati hai
 "on the night of 28 June 2012, CRPF and Chhattisgarh Police were informed about the presence of Naxalites after which their teams started a joint operation
" surakshabalon ke mutabik, do timen basaguda se ravaanaa huin or teen kilometre dur sarkeguda main ek maovadi baithak main pahunchi thim
 The villagers taking part in this meeting, seeing the policemen, started firing on them
 jawaab main police ne bhi un par goliyaan chalaayin

 The Center has tried in the Bombay High Court to try to curb the controversy over the words 'sindh' and 'sindhu' in the national anthem, saying both uses are correct

 The matter will be heard on Friday
 centre ne yah halafanama sevanivrutt professor shrikant malushte kii janhit yachika par diya he jisamen raashtragan main ‘sindh’ shabd ke upyog ko chunauti di gayi he
 The Home Ministry claimed in its affidavit that both the words 'sindhu' for singing and speaking and the word 'sindh' in the written version of the song have the same meaning
 iskaa arth nadi yaa sindhi samudaay donon ke rup main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The affidavit states that ‘both the words‘ Sindh ’and‘ Sindhu ’refer to the river or Sindhi community
 raashtragan koi vrutant nahin he jo desh ke kshetron ko paribhaashit karata he or jab ise likhaa gaya tha us samay bharat kaa hissaa rahe rajyon yaa kshetreey ilaakon kii yah suchi bhi nahin he
 'the Ministry of Home Affairs has also cited the decision given by the Supreme Court in May 2005 dismissing a petition seeking to replace the word' Sindh 'with the word' Kashmir '
 sarkaar ne daawa kiya ki yah aavashyak nahin he ki jab jab desh main kshetreey parivartan ho to har baar raashtragan main sanshodhan kiya jaae
 The government said that removing the word 'sindh' would be against the order issued by the ministry
 isse ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kii avmaananaa bhi hogi
 The PIL claimed that Sindh was part of India when the national anthem was composed in 1917 but it is no longer a part of India and because of this, the word 'sindhu' was included in its place which flowed into India

 He said, 'it has always been understood about elections that it is vote bank politics, votes are based on caste basis but Gujarat has changed this attitude
 gujarat chunaavon ne duniya ko yah dikhaaya he ki chunaav vikaas ke muddon par jeeta ja saktaa he
 Development in Gujarat has resulted in good governance
 vikaas or chunaav ko ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he or gujarat ne ise sabit kar dikhaaya he
 Modi said that he never saw such enthusiasm about elections as was seen in Gujarat elections
 bujurg se lekar yuva tak main chunaavon ko lekar josh najar aayaa
 117-year-old Kathuria Dada of Dadiapada has voted in all elections till date
 junagarh kii maniben jadav, gopalnand maharaj, kalsri kii ramben ramani or ujiben kakadia aise log hai jo apane adhikaron ko samajhate hai, swatantraaa senaniyon ke balidaan ko samajhate hai
 Narendra Modi said that school children also increased my enthusiasm
 in bacchon ne loktantr ke is utsav main gujaratiyon ko apane maton ke adhikaar ke liye aage aane ko kaha
 These children may not vote, but seeing their enthusiasm, the future of Gujarat was very bright
 ye bachche or bujurg bhartiya loktantr ke role model hai
 Modi said, 'during the Sadbhavana Mission and Vivekananda Yuva Vikas Yatra, i got an opportunity to meet hundreds of people in Gujarat
 maine gujarat ke vikaas ko sabake saath saajha kiya or agle paanch varshon ke vikaas kaaryon kii bhi charchaa kii
 Apart from this, he said that i am proud that Gujarat is a state in the world where 3D system was used to reach out to maximum people
 punjab vidhansabha chunaavon main aam aadmi party(aap) kii 'jeet' kaa jashn manaate hue ek video li hua he
 In it, senior leaders and activists of the party like Sanjay Singh are seen celebrating the party's victory in the Punjab elections
 sanjay singh to yahaan tak kehete hue dikh rahe hai ki party ne kul 117 main se 100 se adhik siten jeet lee hai or ab sarkaar banane ja rahi he

 Laughing lightly, the leaders are asking Mann, 'are you in the race for the post of Chief Minister now?' Comments However, the truth is something else
 jab 11 march ko chunavi nattejey aae to punjab main sabase badi party banane kaa sapana uskaa tut gaya
 It won only 20 of the total 117 seats in the state
 vahiin congress 77 siten jitkar satta main 10 varshon baad waapas aa gai
 On the other hand, the ruling akali-bjp coalition so far had to settle for third place with 18 seats
 video main haalanki bhagwant maan ko 50 hajaar se zyada voton se aage bataaya ja rahaa tha lekin vaastaviktaa main vah jalalabad main 20 hajaar voton se haar gaye
 Shiromani Akali Dal leader and outgoing Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal won from here

 Premium charges apply!! BJP national president Amit Shah on Friday announced that changes will be made soon in PM Modi's cabinet
 haalanki shah ne yah bhi kaha ki abhi is badlaav ko lekar koi taarikh tay nahin kii gai he
 Let me tell you that for some time there was speculation about the change in the cabinet
 haalanki shah ne koi taarikh nahin bataai lekin party ke sutron ke mutabik yah june ke pehle hafte main ho saktaa he
 Amit Shah confirmed the news of an early reshuffle in the cabinet during a press conference at the BJP headquarters
 assam main sarbanand sonoval ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad se cabinet main khel mantri kaa pad khaali he
 With this, it is believed that PM Modi may remove some ministers from the cabinet due to poor performance and unable to meet the government's targets
 amritsar east vidhansabha seat se congress ummidavaar navjot singh siddhu ko unki 'siddhuvani' ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 Whether it is a commentary or a laughter show, or a political rally platform, when Sidhu speaks, his idioms, shero-shayari are worth listening to
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki ek vakt aisa bhi tha jab siddhu sharmile swabhaav ke hone kii vajah se kisi se baat karne se bhi kataraate the
 Sometimes, Pacineb Sidhu used to start as the opening batsman for Team India, he used to miss talking, Sidhu preferred to remain silent in the dressing room too
 media se kabhi baat karne kii naubat aati thi to siddhu ke paseene chhot jate the
 This was also confirmed once by former Team India captain Kapil Dev
 kaise hua kayapalat?siddhu kaa kayapalat kaise hua, is raaj kaa khulaasa siddhu ne khud 'aaj tak' se kiya
 Sidhu admitted that when he used to play cricket, he used to talk to someone at that time, then he tried to move around
 siddhu ke mutabik professor dibet ke liye bulaate the to wo chuttee le liya karte the
 Sidhu said, 'had i ever scored good runs, i was afraid that now i would have to talk to the media
 'aatmavishvaas kaa ye he rajbolane main aatmavishvaas kaise aayaa, iske liye siddhu meditation (dhyaan-manan) ko shrey dete hai
 Sidhu said, 'I wake up at 3 am and meditate, it gave me strength
 ye tamaam badlaav jo mere andar aayaa he wo sab paramatma kaa pratap he
 God will be found inside you, it will not be found anywhere else
 ' kahin kuch bolnaa ho to kya koi vishesh taiyaari karte hai, is sawaal ke jawaab main siddhu ne kaha, 'main koi kitaab lekar nahin ghumta hum, koi kitaab chhupaake nahin chalata hum
 What is confidence, what is public speaking? Who will contact the soul
 jo bheetar dubegaa wo bheetar baithe parameshwar ke saath ek rahegaa
 If there is contact with the soul then there is confidence
 agar vah sampark tuutata he to bhagwaan ke naam se andeh paidaa hota he
 If the doubt is to be treated then keep contact with the soul
 bheetar villin raho sab kuch thik ho jayega
 ' sanjay sinha kii teesri rachana 'samay' anuthi he
 The description of the utility of time is available in the book with examples, it is a matter of the control of Sanjay Sinha
 samay-chakra gatiman he uske saath chalem to shreyaskar or yadi pichad gaye to jivan ko aap keval dhoenge use ji nahin paaenge
 If there is a desire to live, then keep in tune with the times and get breakthrough success
 sanjay ne ati saralata se badi baat pustak main spasht kar di he ki samay kabhi kisi kii pratiksha nahin karata
 If you want to move forward, move ahead with time or else life will stop and time will pass
 samay-samay par lekhak sanjay sinha ke jivan main ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai or unhen aagaah karaati jaati hai ki jivan main hamen paryaapt samay miltaa he har kaam kii taiyaari ke liye lekin ham sambhavat: uskaa sadupyog nahin kar pate or baad main samay nikal jane ke baad keval sochate hi rah jate hai ki agar dobaaraa mauka mili to ham chute hue kaary ko puri kushalta ke saath kar sakate the
 But as time goes on, there is no other way than to repent
 or phir jo bhi praapt ho ham use bhagya maan lete hai
 In the book, writer Sanjay Sinha gives an example of himself and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan to prove that in 1988, both of them walked together and one made full preparations and got eighty percent in life and the other knowing all forty
 Stayed at a percentage
 kaaran spasht he jo puri taiyaari ke saath aage badhate hai vah jang jeet lete hai
 It is important to understand the seriousness of time
 jisane pahchaan liya vah samay chakra ke saath talmail baitha letaa he or jivan kii daud main aage hi aage badhata jaataa he
 'time' book teaches us to live, inspires us to be disciplined
 jivan main har pal ghatane vaali ghatana hamen sochane par vivash karti he
 Sanjay has considered the stories narrated by mother in childhood as a school of life because every story has a message hidden in it
 inhen sandeshon ko bade hone par yadi ham apane jivan main utaar len to va na keval ham aane vaale sankat ko pehle se bhaanp lete hai balki us sankat se khud ko bachaa bhi pate hai
 Sanjay Sinha gives great importance to relationships in life
 yahi baat unki pustak 'samay' main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 In Sanjay's own words, "alone we can smile but in the midst of relationships we laugh
 "aaj aage badhane kii daud main insaan bahut akelaa ho gaya he
 Can't share his mind with anyone
 sanjay ne mahabharat ke sanjay kii tarah apni parkhi najaron se yah bhaanp liya he ki suvidha or sanchaar ke saare kritrim sadhano se 'tan' kaa hastinapur haraa-bharaa rahegaa lekin vah 'man' kaa kurushetra haar jayega kyonki samvaad karne ke liye use koi nahin milegaa
 Recognize the fragrance of relationships in time because relationships are forever
 sanjay ne choti-choti ghatnaon ke madhyam se kuleenata or sanskaron kii bhi pahchaan kara di he
 And it has been learned that there is only one moment of time and that is the moment you are living
 bharose main bahut takat hoti he isliye jivan main kitne hi utaar-chadhaav aaen bharosa kabhi tootna nahin chahie
 Sanjay has a very optimistic outlook and lives every moment of time with full diligence and carries the message of every event in life
 sanjay kii yahi soch unhen ek aisa vyaktitv pradaan karti he jo sabase alag he
 Perhaps this is why their relationship with each person is connected
 maanav jivan kshan bhangur he isiilie yah jaanane kii bhi sanjay ne vakaalat kii he ki jo bhi sansar main ghatit hota he uskaa koi na koi prayojan avashya hota he
 If we think this well then we will probably understand that time is very strong
 samay rahete hue yadi ham maanav swabhaav ke swaabhaavik dosha se apane ko mukt kar len to khushiyon kaa sansar hamaare saamne hoga
 Our 'ego' will cease and humility will make us the soul of all and we will be able to separate Neer and Kshi from the conscience
 hamaara jivan main jisase bhi milanaa hota he vah kisi vishesh prayojan se hota he
 It depends on us what eclipses do
 sanjay ne man kii dridhtaa par adhik jor diya he
 We lose the winning bet with a weak mind, but the faith of the mind never lets us lose
 'samay' ko sanjay sinha ne badi kushalta, safagoi se paribhaashit kiya he
 It was a storm of time that even an iron lady like Indira Gandhi fell victim to it
 or unke kuch pakshdhar unke dhur virdohi ban gaye
 But while protesting, it is also important to keep in mind what the nature of the protest will be
 yah samay chakra hi tha ki indira gandhi ne samay ke saath khud ko parishkrut kiya
 And regained power
 samay ke saath khud ko manjana aavashyak ho jaataa he
 It is also necessary that we do not fall prey to over-confidence
 anyathaa patan hamaara hi hoga
 Nor should any person around him provide protection to the person, otherwise one day he will make us his prey
 sanjay sinha kaa drushtikon bada vyapak he
 Every incident has given him a new direction
 prem or dharm ko bhi sanjay ne badi saralata se spasht kiya he
 It is Sanjay's faith in God that gives us humanity
 maanav jivan anmol he
 We must fight the sufferings with courage
 agar dukh he to uske nivaaran kaa maarg bhi he
 Sanjay has also suggested a solution for redress
 samay ke saath agar aapane saamanjasy baitha liya he to aapkaa jivan sarthak he
 Sanjay has mentioned Switzerland in the context of time itself
 jo na keval ek behad khubasurat desh he balki samay kaa bhi paband he
 Your respect is due to the honor of time, just never give up hope
 jahaan ummid he vahiin jivan he
 Look at something with passion, you will definitely get it
 sanjay ishwar ke prati bhi bahut ashavan hai
 They believe that the God with whom Amodh Baan can do nothing to them
 sachai, eemaandaaree, rishton kaa mahatv sanjay kii pehali donon kitabon kii tarah samay main bhi he
 This is Sanjay Sinha's third book in a very short time
 teenon kitabon ne khub prashansa batori he
 Such fast writing and its positive impact on readers makes Sanjay's writing talent and his activism in connecting relationships with Facebook worthwhile
 ham na kuch lekar aae the na lekar jaaenge bas hamaara vyavhaar, hamaari vinramata hamaare saath jaaegi
 This is what Sanjay taught to his mother
 sanjay bhi maanate hai ki mahila aapke jivan main chaahe jis rup main ho, usamen ek maa chuphi hi rahati he

 There is a screen that creates the illusion that you are flying a real ship
 pichley saal ai apni film ' em es dhoni- da antold story' main mahendra singh dhoni kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke liye sushant kai baar dhoni ke ghar gaye, unke sa tha rahe or yahaan tak kii dhoni jaisaa 'helicopter' shot maarna bhi siikhaa

 Sankant posted a video on his social media account in which he is seen flying a plane sitting in the cockpit of a Boeing 737

 Actually he is not a real Boeing-737 but its simulator
 simulator us mashin ko kehete hai jo asli mashin kii hoobahoo nakal hota he
 The cockpit is designed to be exactly like the Boeing-373 and the commands placed inside it resemble the real machine

 # Emmys US President Donald Trump has retracted from his statement that he has full confidence in intelligence agencies' analysis of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and slipped his tongue during the meeting with his Russian counterpart in Helsinki
 was
 rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin ke saath sanyukt rup se samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karne ke dauraan america khufia agenciyon ke vishleshan kaa samarthan nahin karne par trump kii vipaksh sahit unki party ne bhi aalochana kii thi
 Perhaps for the first time in his presidential term, Trump admitted that when he returned on Monday after the summit with Putin, he "felt that there was a need for clarification on his statement about Russia's interference in the 2016 US elections
" 
 'helsinki main raashtrapati putin ke saath sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan 2016 ke america chunaavon main rus ke hastkshep par america khufia samudaay ke nishkarsh kaa samarthan nahin karne ke liye trump ko vipaksh ke saath hi republican party kii bhi aalochana jhelni padi jiske baad vah bayaan se palat gaye
 Some people HATE the fact that i got along well with President Putin of Russia
 They would rather go to war than see this
 It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)july 18, 2018white house main trump ne patrakaron se kaha, 'mujhe america kii mahaan khufia agenciyon par hameshaa se puraa vishwaas he
 Although i am convinced that Russian acts had no effect on the results of the presidential elections, i would like to clarify this
 maine kai baar kaha he, main apane khufia samudaay ke nishkarsh ko sweekaar karata hum ki rus ne 2016 chunaavon main hastkshep kiya tha
 In a press conference with Putin, Trump said that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 presidential elections
 unhone kaha tha, 'mujhe aisa koi kaaran najar nahin aata' ki rus america chunaav main hastkshep kyon karegaa
 Explaining his statement in the White House, Trump said that his tongue had slipped and he wanted to say 'why not' instead of 'why'
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, 'maine kai maukon par khufia agenciyon kii un reporton kaa samarthan kiya he jisamen unhone america chunaav main roosi hastkshep kii baat kahi thi
 ' srinagar se 16 kimi dur bagwan main pichley 1 maah se 160 chaatr-chatraayen fanse hue hai
 On the morning of 16 July, when these students left for Bagwan Inter College, the Koltha bridge was alright but when they returned, the bridge over Alaknanda was broken
 aapadaa kii bhent chadhe is pul kii maar sabase zyada chote bacchon par padi he
 For the last one month, most of the children have not been able to meet their parents
 prashasan ek maah baad bhi abhi tak in bacchon ko nikaalane ke liye kuch nahi kar paaya he
 Local Congress MP Satpal Maharaj has also visited here and given assurances, but after his departure, he is not even aware of these children
 bachche ek maah se fanse hone ke kaaran kaaphi pareshaan hai or akasar rone lagate hai par bacchon ke dukh-dard ko sunne vaala koi nahi he
 The battle for Uttar Pradesh assembly elections has now reached its final turn
 pradhanmantri narendra modike sansadeey kshetra varanasi main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii saakh kaise bache, is jaddojahad main bhaajapa kaa puraa kendriya netritv juta hua he
 Despite this, BJP candidates are facing challenges with their opponents as well as loved ones, due to which the battle in many seats is seen to be interesting
 varanasi main kul aath vidhansabha kshetra hai
 Sevapuri, Shivpuri, Ajgara, Pindra, City Northern, City Southern, Banaras Cantt and Rohanis
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav 2012 main banaras kii teen siton varanasi kaint, varanasi uttari or varanasi dakshini siton par bhaajapa kaa kabja rahaa tha
 
 philhal banaras main bhaajapa ko in apni teenon siten bachaane ke liye edi chotii kaa sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he, jabaki sewapuri vidhansabha main bhi kaante kii takkar dikhaai de rahi he
 
 varanasi dakshini sitmodi ke sansadeey kshetra main yadi koi seat sabase adhik charchaa main he to vah varanasi dakshini seat he
 Because of this, the ticket of Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary, the veteran and current MLA of BJP and who has won the election seven times in a row
 
 This seat is considered a Brahmin dominated seat
 yahaan se bhaajapa ne vartmaan vidhayak shyamdev raay choudhary kaa tikat katkar nilkanth tiwari ko maidan main utaara he
 Rajesh Mishra has got the ticket from SP and Congress alliance from this seat
 rajesh haalanki banaras se congress ke tikat par ek baar saansad bhi chune ja chuke hai
 Despite this, they too have to work hard among the voters
 
 The BSP has fielded Rakesh Tripathi from here
 vah apane virodhiyon ko kadi takkar de rahe hai
 The people of the area say that Muslim and Dalit voters have the key to victory in the Brahmin dominated seat
 yahaan muslim matadaataaon kaa rujhaan sapa kii taraf mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, Rajesh Mishra is giving a tough fight to the BJP candidate
 
 Here, BJP leaders claim that angry party workers have been persuaded after hard efforts
 lekin bhaajapa sutron kii maane to kai baagi andarkhaane hi bhaajapa se bhitarghaat karne main jute hue hai
 
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyakshakeshav prasad maury ne samachar agencyse baatcheet ke dauraan kaha, 'kahin koi naaraazgi nahin he
 Everyone has been persuaded
 bhaajapa ke sabhi kaaryakarta party ko jitaane main jute hai
 Some rebel activists have also been shown the way out
 ’ 
 However, how much damage was done to the BJP due to Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary's displeasure can be gauged from the fact that the BJP High Command had to issue a press note a year in advance saying that the party will send them to the Legislative Council
 
 Varanasi North seat: Varanasi North seat is also stuck between BJP opponents and loved ones
 yahaan se bhaajapa ne vartmaan vidhayak rabindra jaiswal ko tikat diya he
 Like SP and Congress alliance, Abdul Samad Ansari is in the fray
 basapa ne sujith kumaar maury ko is seat se tikat diya he
 BJP rebel Sujit Singh from City North is engaged in spoiling the BJP game in the Teeka Maidan
 party ne haalanki unhen party se nikaal diya he or vah nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par chunaav maidan main hai
 Due to Abdul Samad Ansari being the only Muslim, the trend of Muslim voters is being considered towards him
 tikaa ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko sammaan dene kii bajaay party se nishkasit kar diya
 Now we are in the fray as independent candidates
 janata tay karegi ki hamaara bhavishya kya hoga
 This time the public will teach BJP a lesson
 is seat se bhaajapa ke hi ek or kaaryakarta ashok kumaar singh bhi chunaav maidan main hai
 He is also working hard among the candidates
 haalanki matadaataaon kaa kitna samarthan milegaa yah kahana abhi jaldbaaji hogi
 Varanasi Cantt seat is also witnessing a thorn in the Varanasi Cantt seat in Varanasi parliamentary constituency
 sapa or congress gathbandhan ne is baar haalanki anil shrivastav ko yahaan se tikat diya he
 Anil has contested this seat from Congress earlier also
 tab unhen lagbhag 50 hajaar mat mili the
 This time, he is claiming the BJP to be dusting off the coalition
 anil shrivastav ne kaha ki kaashi ne desh ko ek pradhanmantri diya lekin teen varsho baad bhi yahaan kii sthiti jas kii tas he
 Nothing has happened in the name of development
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne yahaan kaaphi kaam karaaye hai or sabase bada kaam to banaras ko 24 ghante bijli muhaiyaa karana he
 However, Anil Srivastava is being seen as a strong candidate this time from Varanasi
 ilaake ke log bataate hai ki bhaajapa ne is baar pichhali baar kii vidhayak jyotsna shrivastav ke bete saurabh shrivastav ko tikat diya he
 While the people of the area are alleging familyism on the one hand, Saurabh is putting his full strength in front of a talented player like Anil Srivastava
 basapa ne is seat se rigwan ahamed ko maidan main utaara he
 Although there is a significant number of Muslim voters in Cantt, the experts here suggest that Muslim voters may lean towards the sp-congress alliance to defeat the BJP
 sewapuri vidhansabha sitabanaras kii sewapuri seat par bhi virodhiyon ne bhaajapa kii tagdi gherebandi kii he
 On this seat, bjp's ally Party Apna Dal (anupriya Patel) candidate is Neelratan Patel
 jabaki isi seat se anupriya kii maa krishna patel ne apane gut kii taraf se vibhuti narayan singh ko tikat diya he
 Vibhuti Narayan Singh has been the leader of the BJP for a long time and there is a good penetration among the voters of the area
 duusari ore sapa or congress gathbandhan kii taraf se mantri surendra patel chunaav maidan main hai
 Last time too, he won this seat with a good margin

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the telephone on Monday, during which both discussed key island and international issues and resolved to increase cooperation to combat terrorism
 roosi rajanyik sutron ne bataaya ki putin ne aagaamee sansadeey chunaav main modi kii safalataa kii kaamana kii
 He said the two leaders reiterated a common desire to increase cooperation to fight international terrorism and resolve other major world issues
 sutron ke mutabik donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet mukhya rup se dwipaksheeya sahyog or maujuuda antarrashtriya muddon par kendrit rahi
 During the talks, the Russian President invited Modi as the chief guest for the Eastern Economic Forum, a program to be held in Vladivostok in September 2019, sources said
 donon netaaon ne ek duusare ko navvarsh kii garmjoshi bhari badhai di
 According to a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, the two countries agreed to keep the progress made in the field of strategic partnership last year
 bataa den ki raashtrapati putin jab pichley saal oktober main bharat aae the to us dauraan bhi unhone eastern iconomic forum ke liye piem modi ko nyauta diya tha
 On his part, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated the people of Russia on the occasion of Christmas
 bayaan ke mutabik donon netaa is baat par sahamat dikhe ki bharat or rus ke sambandh vaishvik bahupaksheeya sambandhon ko barkaraar rakhane main ahm role nibhaate hai
 Therefore, the two countries will maintain close ties with the United Nations, BRICS, SCO and other organizations
 ise chaahe anna andolan kaa asar mana jaae yaa kisi dirghakaalik chintan kaa, lekin abhi tak vyakti kii bajaae raashtra ko mahatvapurn maanane vaala rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ab is nattejey par pahunchaa he ki 'desh ko eemaandaar or charitravaan nayakon kii jarurat he' or 'shakhaon ke jariye aise nayakon kii khoj kii jaaegi
 'the meeting of the National Executive Board of the Sangh held in Gorakhpur on October 14, 15 and 16 will be particularly remembered for the first time that Sangh chief Mohanrao Madhukarrao Bhagwat publicly called out that' the Sangh needs volunteers, not volunteers' is
 'rashtriya kaaryakarini mandal kii baithak is lihaaj se ahm maani jaati he ki isamen liye gaye faislon ke aadhaar par hi sangh puure varsh apane kaarykram, abhiyaan or andolanon kii ruparekha tay karata he
 It would be a coincidence that during his stay, Anna received so many statements from Digvijay Singh, Arvind Kejriwal and Anna himself about the 'credit' of the Sangh's relations and movement that the Sangh had to repeatedly clarify its position in this regard
 vijayadashami utsav ke avasar par saarvajanik sambodhan main bhagwat ne saaf kaha tha ki sangh har achche kaam kaa samarthan karata he, isiilie anna ke andolan ko uskaa samarthan mila
 Later, Sir Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, the Union's head caretaker, while speaking to journalists expressed regret over the conspiracy raised by the Congress General Secretary (digvijay) by a devious political move by a person like Anna, saying that the Sangh should not have any relation with Anna There is no refrain, but if Anna is avoiding Sangh, he should be asked about it
 baharhaal 39 praanton se aae 450 sheersh padaadhikariyon ke teen divasiy chintan ke baad paarit prastaavon par najar daalen to saaf sankawt dikhte hai ki aane vaale dinon main sangh na sirf apane santhnik dhaanche ko samrudh banane ke prayaas tej karegaa, balki janata ke bich andolanon ke jariye apni sakriyata main ijapha bhi karegaa
 For this, the Sangh has chosen cultural projects such as conducting awareness campaigns against the increasing pollution in the Ganges and organizing various programs in the country and the world on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, while on the other hand the communal and targeted violence prevention brought by the Center It has also decided to run a mass movement against the Bill
 prastaav main is vidheyak ko 'samaaj kii ekta or akhandta ko todane vaala' bataate hue kaha gaya he ki isse na kavval bahusankhyak or alpsankhyakon main duuri badhegi, balki yah hindu samaaj main bhi anusuchit jati or janajati main bhed badhayega
 Apart from this, the Sangh can also take an aggressive approach on the issue of national security on 'government inaction'
 kaaryakari mandal main rashtriya suraksha ke liye prabhavi ranneetik pahal par paarit 5 prishthon ke prastaav main desh ke chaturdik maujuud khataron khaskar china se mil raheen chunautiyon, samrik drushti se ahm ilaakon main chal rahi pariyojnaon main uski ghuspaith or 3ji tathaa 4ji jaisi doorsanchaar praudyogiki main chini upkarnon ke badhate istemaal se paidaa ho sakane vaale khataron par vistaar se charchaa he
 After the meeting, the head caretaker Suresh Joshi considered the government's sluggish attitude on infrastructural security arrangements as dangerous, saying, "the morale of our forces is good, but the lack of means makes it appear weak, it is worrying
" ''haalanki sangh ke jamaavade main purv pramukh sudarshan, sah sarkarywah dattatraya hosbale, ram madhav, suresh soni, raamji laal or vihip ke ashok singhl, praveen togadiya ke alaava bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh surya pratap shahi or vinay katiyaar samet bhaajapa ke kai bade netaa shaamil hue, magar sangh ne bhaajapa se jude masalon par tippanee karne ke bajaae use uskaa aantarik faisla bataakar pallaa jhaad liya
 But the BJP is treating this meeting as Sanjeevani

 ) Most students are afraid of maths and due to this nervousness, they are unable to read this subject properly
 lihaaja is dilachasp vishay se unki duuri badhane lagati he
 Students always complain about the subject of mathematics, that despite all the efforts and hard work, they are not able to solve the difficult questions of this subject
 agar aap bhi is vishay kii kathinaaiyon se pareshaan hai to ye tips aapke liye hai :1
 If you do not understand any topic, then leave it and focus on it instead of moving forward
 maan lijie aap alzebra pard rahe hai or aapako ise samajhane main kaaphi pareshaani aa rahi he to use choden nahin
 Never think that it would be better to leave it and read another chapter
 ganit ke saare chapter ek-duusare se jude rahete hai
 If you leave a previous chapter, then you may face more difficulties in the next chapter
 isliye thodi or mehnat karke pehle jo chapter haath main he, use taiyaar karen
 2
 kitabon main die gaye udhaaharan ko jarur banane kaa prayaas karen
 If you look at this solution, then you will understand how the questions of that chapter will be
 kitaab ke alaava aap udaahranon ko samajhane ke liye dividi, sidies, audio casets kaa sahaara bhi le sakate hai
 Create easy questions at the beginning of the chapter
 step dar step aap kathin sawaalon ko bhi hal karne lagenge
 It is better to practice mathematics than to read a book
 3
 If you are asked to explain or solve any mathematics question, then get ready for it immediately
 aap jab kisi ko bataane kaa prayaas karenge to aap khud bhi use behatar tareeke se samajhane lagenge
 It is believed that when you teach something to someone, you get a better grip on that topic
 isliye zyada se zyada dusron ke sawaalon ko bhi hal karne kaa prayaas karen
 4
 hameshaa apane solution ko saaf-suthra rakhen
 This will not confuse you while making questions
 5
 Memorizing the formula is most important in mathematics
 agar aapako vah yaad nahin he to aapkaa samay bhi barbaad hoga or aap sawaal hal bhi nahin kar paaenge

 In a book release function focused on Nitish Kumar's speeches in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Modi said that for the next twenty to twenty-five years, no leader of Nitish Kumar's contest could be found
 modi kaa kahana tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarah nitish main bhi nirnay lene kaa saahas he
 He enumerated several big decisions of Nitish Kumar in this regard
 inamen mahilaon ko panchayat main pachaas pratishat aarakshan dene kaa maamla bhi tha
 Modi admitted that the long line that Nitish has drawn will be difficult to cross for the next 25 years

 modi ne rail mantri ke rup main bhi nitish ke kaamkaaj kii charchaa kii or kaha vahaan bhi unhone ek se ek kaam kiye
 Modi has been impressed by Nitish's ways of functioning
 iske kaaran unke apni party ke netaa unki aalochana bhi karte rahe hai

 unhone is sambandh main nitish kumaar ke kai bade nirnay ginaae
 There was also a case of giving fifty percent reservation in panchayat to women
 modi ne mana ki nitish ne jo lambii rekha khinchi he use agle 25 varshon tak paar karnaa mushkil hoga
 The comments susheel modi ne nitish kumaar kii tarifon ke pul baandhte hue kaha ki amuman mana jaataa he ki vikaas se vot nahin miltaa lekin nitish ne ise bhi galat sabit kar diya he
 Modi also talked about Nitish's functioning as a railway minister and said that he did one by one work there too
 modi nitish ke kaamkaaj karne ke tareekon se prabhavit rahe hai
 Due to this, leaders of his own party have also been criticizing him

 abhi tak aapako sabase acchhee naseehat koun-si mili he?is bare main mat socho ki log kya kahenge kyonki ve commercial yaa bijness vaale nazariye se soch rahe hai
 We are artists, our relationship is with emotion
 isliye jo role kar rahe ho, usamen khud ko udel do
 This advice was given to me by Aamir
 2017 aapke liye bemisaal varsh tha
 Has the industry changed about you? My acceptance has definitely increased
 ab ve mujh par yakeen karte hai
 Now they are beginning to think that they can make a film with me and spend a little money on me
 bade studios ne aapse sampark kiya yaa nahin?main kuch achche filmkaaron ke saath kuch acchhee kahaniyon kaa hissaa ban rahaa hum or usamen main khush hum ji
 After Shahid Azmi, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Subhash Chandra Bose, would i want to do any other real life character? Bhagat Singh gives me a lot of judgment

 Former Indian skipper MS Dhoni has become angry over the batting form and a new debate has started
 ipel ke pichley chaar maichon main dhoni lagaataar fail hue or chote score banaakar out hue isaki vajah se soshal media par hashtag“ # Dhonidropped”trend karne laga or soshal media par cricketpremiyon ne dhoni kii kharaab form kii khub dhajjiyaan udaayi
 Sehwag also landed after Lee, in support of Dhoni, a few days ago, Brett Lee came in support of MS Dhoni's poor form and now it's Virender Sehwag
 chaar match khel chuke dhoni ne ab tak kul 33 ran banaae hai jisamen vah 12*, 5, 11 or shuukravaar ko 5 ran banaakar rising pune superjoint ke gujarat ke khilaaf match main out ho gaye
 Sehwag emphasized that the position that Dhoni comes to batting is tough and people need to be patient as he will quickly return to form with josh-kharos
 ye bhi padhein-ganguli ko nahin dhoni par bharosa, bole- acha tii-20 khilaadi hone par ndehek channel se baatcheet main sahvaag ne kaha, “jis pojishan par dhoni batting karne ke liye aate hai vah bahut kathin he
 She is still the best at number 5 and 6
 isamen koi sanshay nahin he ki vah jaldi hi form main vaapasi karenge
 There is still a lot of time left in the IPL
 dhoni jaise khilaadi ke khel par teen yaa chaar pariyon me nirnay nahin dena chahie
 Praising Dhoni's performance in the series against Talented England, not tested by the IPL, Sehwag said that Dhoni is not in any bad form and added that the Champions Trophy should not be wished at all without Dhoni
 
 unhone kaha, “unhone haal hi main england ke khilaaf match vijeta shatak lagaaya tha
 So, i don't think he is not in his form
 aap dhoni ke bina team india kii champions trophy main jane kii kaamana bhi nahin kar sakate
 Such things can happen in a tournament like IPL
 dhoni jaise anbhavi khilaadi ko ipel jaise toornament main nahin parkhaa janaa chahie

 Militants set fire to government school, the school was to be held on Saturday
 The terrorists set fire to a government school in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir
 is skool main shanivaar ko board kii pariksha honi thi
 It is clear from this act of terrorists that they are dazed by the recovering situation in Kashmir
 31 oktober se kashmir centre shasit pradesh ho gaya he or dhire-dhire jindagi vahaan par patari par laut rahi he
 In better Kashmir, terrorists are carrying out a cowardly act
 5 mazdooron kii hatyabata den ki haal hi main jammu-kashmir ke kulgaam main aatankiyon ne 5 mazdooron kii bhi hatya kar di
 All 5 laborers were from Murshidabad in West Bengal

 The laborers of Bokhara Bahlnagar village of Sagardidhi police station in Murshidabad were kidnapped by the terrorists and then killed
 ye majdoor kashmir ke kulgaam main rajmistre kaa kaam karte the
 All these workers went to Kashmir a month ago to work
 aatankiyon ke nishane par majdoor31 oktober ko jammu-kashmir main nai vyavastha lagu ho gai
 After Article 370 was neutralized, Kashmir was now transformed into a union territory
 yahi kaaran he ki pichley kuch dinon main aatankiyon ne mazdooron ko nishaanaa bananaa shuru kiya he
 In the last few days, terrorists have killed 11 laborers by carrying out similar attacks
 mangalvaar ko jab europea sansad ke 23 saansad jammu-kashmir main shanti kii tasviir ko dekhne aae the, tabhi aatankiyon ne kulgaam main hamalaa kar diya
 The five laborers who died in the terror attack were all residents of West Bengal and were working as laborers in building houses here

 Meanwhile, terrorists are constantly working to spoil the atmosphere

 There are three months left for the presidential election in America and now the election campaign has been very fast
 chunaav prachaar main teji ke saath hi donon ummidavaaron baraak obama or mit romany ne ek duusare par tikhe hamale shuru kar die hai
 In the context of 'robinhood', Obama called his rival Mitt Romney 'romneyhood', while the Republican candidate did not delay in retaliating
 romany ne kaha ki raashtrapati kaa un par hamalaa puri tarah galat or ‘obamolony’ kaa hissaa he
 Two fresh words have been added to American politics amid the bitter accusations between Obama and Romney
 ye donon shabd ‘romanywood’ or ‘obamolony’ hai
 Presidential elections are to be held in the US in November this year
 america raashtrapati ne romany par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki republican ummidavaar ‘romanyhud’ hai kyonki vah apni kar yojana ke jariye robinhood kii style se ulat garibon kii bajaay amiron ko phayda pahunchaayenge
 Romney retaliated on Obama's blows
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki obama kii ore se kiya ja rahaa hamalaa ‘dhong, ghinauna, asaty or obamolony’ ke chalan ko badhaava dene vaala he
 Romney said in a conversation with a channel, 'we are seeing that the President is making many things about me and my policies which are completely wrong
 vah sachai se ulat baat kar rahe hai
 At an election campaign in Illinois, Romney asked those present to look into the work of the US president
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aap jaananaa chaahate hai ki obama kaa dobaaraa nirvachan hamen kahaan le jayega to aap unke saadhe teen saal ke kaamkaaj par gaur kariye
 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi ke satta main waapas aane kii sambhaavna chunaav ghoshit hone ke pehle hafte main prabal dikh rahi he
 While it is also true that this time the top BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh are going from worker to worker assuming that the number of seats in Uttar Pradesh will be less
 vah pichley loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main aadhi bhi ho sakati he
 But despite this, a month or 45 days ago, the BJP which was struggling for double digit marginalization in Uttar Pradesh has returned to the game
 agar aap uttar pradesh or bihar kii raajnneeti ko baarikiyon ko raajnneetik chashme se, apane purvagrah ko kuch samay ke liye taak par rakhkar dekhenge to isi nattejey par pahunchenge ki pradhanmantri modi kaa ek baar phir pradhanmantri bananaa mushkil nahin rahaa
 There is no difference between the Samajwadi party-bsp Mahagathbandhan in Uttar Pradesh, compared to Bihar where the Mahagathbandhan is ruling the number of seats so far, but due to the separation of Congress, Muslim voters are scattered in many seats
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa ke paksh main kai kaaran achaanak uske liye jeet kaa maarg prashast karte dikh rahe hai
 The biggest factor in this is the personality of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is impeccable for his supporters despite all the allegations made by Rahul Gandhi in the Rafale case
 piem modi philhal uttar pradesh kaa daura kar rahe hai
 After several decades in Indian politics, Modi has emerged as a politician who cannot do anything wrong to his supporters
 jise aap kah sakate hai ve kalt image vaale netaa banakar ubhare hai
 His supporters will find you accepting every truth that the educated unemployed in the country are troubled, the farmer is going to waste, his life is going through troubles due to the prohibition on the purchase and sale of animals, especially the cow
 lekin unka tark hota he ki modi pakistan ko to munhtod jawaab de rahe hai
 This is an argument in front of which they cover every failure of their leader
 duusari baat bhaajapa ke paksh main he uskaa majboot sanghathan
 If you travel somewhere in Uttar Pradesh in connection with elections, you cannot ignore the truth of the expansion of the organization of Amit Shah and the RSS
 iskaa sidhaa laabh modi ko chunaav main milegaa
 Especially in the rural areas, the way booth level workers try to flow every discussion or debate with their logic or sophistication, you realize that their months-long hard work is now paying off in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava pichley saal teen vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad saamaanya varg, jinhen agadi jati kaha jaataa he, ke liye das pratishat aarakshan ke baad ab aapako chowk chauraahon par in jatiyon ke naaraaz log nahin milenge, jo kuch samay pehle tak apni bhadaas nikaal rahe the
 Although how many people will get the job, it can be a question of controversy
 iske alaava kisaan, jo naaraaz chal rahe the, ve ab do hajaar rupee milane kii aashaa main modi ke khilaaf nahin bolte
 Samajwadi Party and BSP are no less in means, resources, their voters are seen on the ground, but the workers are either silent or not found
 sabase badi dikkat he ki jahaan yah donon dal ise mandal banaam kamandal banane main lage hai vahiin philhal bhaajapa, khaskar modi sab par baari dikh rahe hai
 Yes, there is no effect of Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh at present
 yaa to unhen chunaav ke nateezon kaa purvanumaan he yaa unke feedback system main sanket honge ki is chunaav main bahut zyada sakriyata okhlee main sar daalane ke samaan he
 At present, the election campaign has not started and the names of the candidates have not been released by most parties
 pichhali baar kii tulana main bhaajapa ke campagne manageron ko maaloom he ki unke virdohi is baar ekajute hai lekin unke samarthak is gathbandhan ke liye vot denge is par kisi ko shaq nahin
 But in politics, you also have to assume that air can change anytime
 iske baavjood philhal uttar pradesh main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jaadu chal rahaa he
 Pakistan's Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that Islamabad has decided not to attend the conference on the future of Afghanistan in Bonn, Germany on Monday, in protest against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) attack on 26 November
 
 khaar ne kaha ki pakistan kii samprabhutaa tathaa akhandta se kisi bhi keemat par samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 Speaking to a news channel, he said that this decision has been taken keeping in view the sovereignty of the country
 'associated press of pakistan' ke anusaar, videsh mantri ne kaha ki pakistan aise vaataavaran main prabhavi dhang se kaam nahin kar saktaa, jisamen sahyogiyon dwaara uski suraksha tathaa samprabhutaa kii guarantee na di jaae
 He said that national interest is the top priority of the government
 ullekhneey he ki 26 navambar ko pakistan kii do suraksha chaukiyon par nato ke hawaii hamale main 24 pakistani sainik maare gaye the
 After this, Pakistan stopped supplying essential materials from its land to NATO
 dharti par based jananath se rubaru karwaane vaala kashmir aaj apni khubasurat vaadiyon or kesar ke liye nahin balki anuchhed 370 ko lekar surkhiyon main bana hua hai
 On Monday, the Modi government suddenly decided to remove article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir kii kyari main uge kesar ke charche duniyabar main mashhoor hai
 Saffron is cultivated in Pampur in Kashmir and Kishtwar in Jammu
 yahaan kaa kesar kharidne ke liye logon ko ek moti keemat chukaani padati he
 Saffron has also been used in Ayurveda to treat beauty, taste and ailments
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai gunon se bharpoor is kesar kii utpatti sabase pehle aakhir kab or kahaan hui thi
 Let's know what is the whole truth of this saffron story that started 2000 years ago
 kesar ko lekar kaha jaataa he ki sabase pehle kashmir ghati main visheshkar pampor kshetra main kesar kii kheti san 550 main aarambh hui thi, jo aaj tak kii ja rahi he
 Kashmiri saffron gives a tough competition in taste and quality to saffron grown in Britain
 shahi kesar-kesar ke jamuni rang ke phulon ke bich main jo laal rang ke reshe hote hai, unheen se sabase badhiya kism kaa kesar miltaa he jise shahi kesar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 By the way, a flower has three to seven fibers and once its seed is planted, it lives for 10 to 15 years
 kaise judakashmir secesar kaa naam -ek danta katha ke anusaar kareeb 800 saal pehle ek sufi sant kashmir main aae the
 These Sufi saints are believed to have brought some saffron plants with them from the Middle East
 lekin jab wo ek baar biimaar pad gaye to ek sthaneey hakim ne unka ilaaj kiya
 Due to which he was happy that in return he gave a plant of saffron
 is tarah kesar kaa paudha kashmir main aayaa tha
 Historians do not agree with the story of Sufi saint - Some historians of Kashmir did not agree with this legend
 kashmir kii pracheen samskruti ke visheshgy or kavi mohammad usuf tang kaa kahana he ki kashmir main kesar kii paidaavaar 2000 saal pehle bhi hoti thi
 Which is also mentioned in the stories of the Tantric Hindu king here
 professor tang ke anusaar kashmir ke vyapaaree pracheen athens, rome or iraan ke saath bhi kesar kaa vyapaar karte the
 Ancient tradition - According to the people who cultivate saffron here, the practice of cultivating saffron is about 2000 years old
 jisaki vajah se kesar kii kheti karne ke taur-tareeke se lekar use kheton tak pahunchane ke baad kesar ugane kaa har tarika bilkul pracheen he
 Saffron flower - Saffron flower is purple in color
 har phool ke bichombich teen laal dhabbe hote hai
 Nothing is thrown from the saffron flowers
 pankhadiyaan sabzi ke rup main kha lee jaati hai
 The stalks are given to the animals to eat and the rest is the real saffron
 uske bhi alag-alag prakaar hote hai
 Which saffron is the purest red spots or stain is the purest type of saffron that is most in demand
 iske baad number aata he punkesar kaa or akhir main in sabakaa mila jula mishran jo sabase sasti kism kaa kesar he
 Farmers keep it with themselves
 uttarakhand main baadh se hui tabaahi se chaukanna hue jila prashasan ne yamuna or hindon ke taton se sate 30 gaanvon main red alert kii ghoshnaa kii
 Sources said that residents of 30 villages have been asked to be prepared to move to other places
 unhone kaha ki graminon ko rahane kii asthaayee suvidha pradaan karne ke liye jile ke praathmik vidhyalay bhawanon main vyavastha kii gayi he
 District Collector Kumar Ravikant Singh inspected the villages on the banks of both rivers and asked the irrigation department to protect the embankment from any damage
 unhone adhikariyon se yah bhi sunishchit karne ke liye kadam uthaane ko kaha ki baadh kaa pani gaanvon main na ghuse

 According to the central government formula, a 2% increase will be given on dearness allowance, which will be implemented from 1 January 20176

 ve ye jaanate hai ki bihar main kuch hi log hai jo bank kaa puraa lone lautaate hai
 These middlemen are generally focused on getting loans on agricultural loan schemes - this is a sector with low risk and big benefits
 niti anusaar, centre or rajya sarkaar bainkon par krishi sambandhi lone ke aavanton ke liye dabaav banaati hai
 Agriculture credit ratio is already 38 in Bihar due to continuous thrust of the government
 52 fisadi par pahunch chukaa he jabaki rashtriya ausat 18 fisadi he
 "A fixed figure is given to banks to distribute Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) as soft loans to farmers," explains the manager of a branch of Bihar Regional Gramin Bank in detail
 yah praathamikta vaala kshetra hota he or lakshya kabhi-kabhaar hi puraa ho paata he, aise main manjaron ko yah dar lagata he ki agar unhone50 fisadi kaa aankada hasil nahin kiya to unka tabadalaa ho jayega yaa phir unke khilaaf kadi karrwai bhi ho sakati he
 In such a situation, crooks type brokers take advantage of these situations, they seek loan applicants and collect the portion
 samasya tab paidaa hoti he jab ye dalal laalchee ho jate hai, farji logon or nakli kaagajon ko pesh karte hai, or lone ke liye ham par dabaav banaate hai
 Not every time but often we have to bow to their demands
 aakhirkaar ve hai to badmaash hi, or rajya sarkaar hamen kisi tarah kii suraksha bhi muhaiyaa nahin karaati
 "most of the rural branches of national commercial banks in Bihar have become like double-edged swords, cutting bank officials from both sides
" koi adhikari yaa to bichauliyon kii baat maane or badale main ghoose le, yaa phir aparaadhiyon kii baat na maanane par pitane ke liye taiyaar rahe or yahaan tak ki jaan se haath dho baithe
 The manager of each rural branch is five crore a year
 tak kaa lone jari kar saktaa he
 Bihar has a total of 4,723 bank branches, with rural branches predominating
 bihar state level bankers cameti (bsaelbisi) ke aankade bataate hai ki bainkon ne krishi lone ke taur par 2010-11 main 10,000 karod ru
 Were issued
 upie-1 sarkaar ne 2008-09 ke kendriya bajet main krishi karj maafee yojana kii ghoshnaa kii thi, jisamen chote or seemaant kisaanon ke sabhi krishi karjon ko maaf kar diya gaya
 This is also a big reason due to which the crowd of borrowers has been attracted
 unhen ummid he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari main aisi hi duusari karj maafee yojana aa sakati he
 According to a bank official, "loan takers believe they will not need to repay it
" isamen tajjub nahin ki isliye ve bichauliyon ko karj kii aadhi rakam bhi khushi se de dete hai or ye bichauliye branch manageron kii mileebhagat se acchhee-khaasi kamai kar rahe hai
 "these figures point to a grudge for a soft agricultural loan and bring out the whole story
" 2010-11 main bihar ke sabhi bainkon ne 14,02,830 logon ko kisaan credit card jari kiye the
 This number is 30 times that of the 47,347 beneficiaries of the card in undivided Bihar in 1999–2000
 bihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, jo vitt mantralay bhi sambhaal rahe hai, karj dene main bank adhikariyon ke ghapalon ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 He says, "there is more corruption in banks in Bihar than in any government office
" bichauliyon or bhrashtachar ke liye maukon ko khatm karne ke liye bainkon ko seva ke adhikaar kaa niyam lagu karnaa chahie
 In many cases of loan scams, sporadic investigations by the police have confirmed large scale irregularities in the disbursement of KCC loans
 is saal may main arriya police ne central bank of india ke teen branch manageron or do head clerkon ko 15 karod ru
 Arrested in KCC loan fraud case
 is maamle main bichauliyon kii mileebhagat se farji dastavejon ke aadhaar par lone die gaye the
 In Khagaria, fraud cases were registered against the branch managers of Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Grameen Bank
 june, 2012 main nalanda main dhokhadhadi karke kisaan credit card ke tahat lone lene ke liye 92 bichauliyon ke khilaaf exiar darj kii gai
 a number of cases have come up in the police investigation of Shekhar's murder
 pataa chalaa he ki unke purvavartiyon ne 55 farji lone jari kiye the
 Ravindra Yadav, the prime accused in the case, has taken a loan in the name of each member of his family
 yahi nahin, mrit logon ke naam par bhi lone liye gaye hai
 He is currently in judicial custody

 aapane puraane bwyfriend se naata tod liya he or kisi nae dost ke saath dating kaa lutf uthaa rahi hai
 The boy is really good and you are serious about him now, but there is a problem
 vah yah ki aapkaa dating partner aapako lekar utana gambhir nahin dikhataa, jitani ki aap hai
 So get ready
 khud se sawaal karen ki kya vaaki aap us ladke ko paane ke liye mehnat karnaa chaahati hai or jawaab agar haa hota he, to aaj se hi jute jaaie apane partner ko pataane or fasaane main
 But in such a way that he can never get out of your clutches
 tips ham aapako dete hai
 
 
 At first glance, if he likes you and you have made up your mind to get with him for a lifetime, not for a few months, then do not forget to build a relationship on the first date
 kyonki isse aap unki khaas doston main shaamil hone ke baje ‘van nite sted relation’ kii list main shaamil ho sakati hai
 Never forget to mold yourself according to them
 agar aapane khud ko unke anusaar badal diya, to aapaki shakhsiyat unhen prabhavit hi nahin kar paaegi
 Because your real face will not come in front of them
 dating kaa chaahe koi din yaa saal kyon na ho, uskaa puri tarah se anand uthaaen, taaki aapke saathi ko yah mahasoos na ho ki aap unke saath ko enjvaay nahin karatin
 In the early days of dating, give your friends the same amount of time and attention that you give to your partner
 agar aapako unki choti choti baaten buree lag jaati hai, to pareshaan na hon
 When women start thinking from the heart, they take the matter to heart
 lekin shuruaati daur main jaraa sa intjaar behatar vikalp he
 In at least three months, you cannot be angry with them for trivial matters
 kabhi bhi apane yaa unke doston ke bich unhen apana bwyfriend na bataaen, tab tak jab tak vah khud sabake saamne aapako apni garlfriend ke rup main sweekaar na karen
 If you do not like anything in their living conditions, then let them know about it immediately instead of remaining silent
 agar vah vaade karne se bachate hai, to unhen aise jodon kaa udhaaharan den, jinase vah mili hue hai or jo ekadusre ke saath khush hai
 Believe it, after this, he will be able to easily bind you with promises
 agar unka koi purana prem sambandh rahaa he, to aap unhen usase achaanak katane yaa bhuulane ke liye dabaav nahin bana saktin
 So if he talks to his old girlfriend and he really has respect for you, then he will definitely tell you the true reason for this relationship while appreciating your feelings
 gusse main bhi apni jabaan par kabu rakhen
 Because he can forgive you for bitter things, but such things can never be forgotten

 Modi is also the head of the Group of Ministers (GOM) looking into the technical issues of the GST network (GSTN)
 iske alaava modi jiesti parishad ke sadsy bhi hai
 He said that some states believe that petrol and diesel should be brought under GST
 vahiin kuch anya rajya aisa nahin chaahate
 He told reporters, "I believe this issue will be resolved in the coming days
" mujhe lagata he ki jald petroleum utpaada jiesti kaa hissaa honge
 In response to a question, Modi said that he believes petroleum products should be under GST
 haalanki, iske saath hi unhone kaha ki yah unki nijee raay he
 Worldwide, petroleum products fall under the purview of GST
 modi ne pichley maheene mantristareey baithak kii adhyakshata kii thi

 Modi said that if the growth rate comes down in one or two quarters then it cannot be called economic slowdown
 yah ek chakra he
 During the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, there have been many such quarters when the growth rate had come down

 ) According to sources, both of them were so enchanted that there was a buzz in Delhi that 20 members of the Aam Aadmi Party had gone
 chunaav ayog ne apni taraf se aupchaarik elaan to nahin kiya he magar aise gopneey maamle baahar bhi aa jate hai or bijepi congress or aap aapas main bhid bhi jate hai
 According to sources, there is a matter of membership of 20 mlas, after all, their job is also going to go, so today their talk in the job series, you young people should not be sad, especially the candidates of Jharkhand and Rajasthan, are in my attention, when we next week or when Will also take time to handle the front
 esayssi 2015 or 16 ke paas hue abhyarthiyon ke liye kitna acha hota agar 26 janvari se pehle unhen jwining letters mil jaataa
 How happy she would have been
 baharhaal dilli ke vidhayakon kii taraf mudate hai
 The Election Commission has sent its recommendation to the President on the membership of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party in the office of profit
 hamaare sahyogi hrydayesh joshi ke anusaar ayog kii sifarish ke baad raashtrapati ke paas dastakhat karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin rah jaataa he
 After that it can be challenged in the court itself
 is maamle kii time line dekh lete hai
 - On 13 March 2015, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appointed 21 mlas as Parliamentary Secretaries
 - 19 june 2015 ko vakil prashanth patel ne raashtrapati ke paas yachika di ki yah offis of proffit kaa maamla he, arthath in vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd honi chahie
 - On June 24, 2015, the Delhi Assembly passed the removal of disqualification amendment bill 2015 and sent it to the President
 - isamen back date se sansadeey sachivon ko offis of profit maamle main chhot dene kii baat kahi
 - On 13 June 2016, the President refused to sign the bill
 - 25 june 2016 ko centre sarkaar ne bill vidhansabha ko bhej diya
 Between 14 and 21 July 2016, the Election Commission held a personal hearing of 21 mlas
 - 8 sitambar 2016 ko dilli hoicourt ne 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 On September 8, 2016, the Election Commission issued a show cause notice to 21 mlas
 - 24 june 2017 ko chunaav ayog ne aap vidhayakon kii apil riject kar di
 On 9 October 2017, the Commission again issued notice asking the mlas for clarification
 - 19 janvari 2018 ko ayog ne sadsyta radd karne kii sifarish kar di
 The High Court quashed the appointment of these mlas that the Lieutenant Governor did not have the sign, hence illegal
 is par bahes hui ki jab niyukti hi avaidh thi to phir offis of profit kaa maamla kaise banataa he
 It was argued that even before the High Court considered it illegal, the AAP MLA was in that position
 ab doosraa sawaal he ki kya aap ke vidhayakon ne laabh liya, yani selary yaa bhatta
 It is argued that they had found the room and spent on the maintenance of the room
 par supreme court ke kai faislon main saaf-saaf kaha gaya he ki laabh kaa pad yani vidhayak ko laabh mil rahaa ho
 Whether the post of profit will be decided only by salary, it will not be from the scale of placing or removing them
 hamen nahin maaloom ki chunaav ayog ke paas kya tathy hai
 The matter of the post of profit has reached the Supreme Court many times and the court has given a clear explanation of what the posts of profit are
 21 agast 1954 ko loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar ne rajyasabha ke chairman se salaah kar offis of profit ke liye ek cameti banaai
 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava, due to which it is called Bhargava Committee
 ve hisar se saansad the
 The committee suggested that a bill should be cleared to clarify which post is beneficial and which is not
 pediti acharya ne apni kitaab main iske bare main likhaa he
 The Supreme Court has set some tests to determine the office of profit
 pehla test yah he ki offis he yaa nahin
 The second test is whether the profit was made or not
 sabase ahm test yah he ki kya sarkaar ne niyukti kii he
 Does the government pay the MLA, pay the allowance
 laabh ke pad ke peeche adarsh kalpana yah thi ki vidhayak duusare kaam na karen kyonki uskaa kaam sadan main hona or janata kii awaz uthaanaa he
 He should not be under the control of the government
 varanaa vah janata kii awaz nahin uthaa paaegaa
 But does this also apply in practical terms
 awwal to vidhansabhaon ke satr bhi bahut kam dinon ke hote hai
 Is it not a moral offense? yahi nahin, vidhayak sadan main wheep ke aadhaar par apni party ke liye vot karata he
 He is the representative of the people on paper but the vote is according to the whip of the party
 phir offis of profit kii kalpana kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Think for yourself
 ek baar pandicherry ke meyar pad par vidhayak kii niyukti ho gai
 This was considered by the Election Commission as the Office of Profit because many allowances were available
 magar ise offis of profit nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata tha
 Overall there is no valid interpretation of the Office of Profit
 2006 main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad die
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of Trans Yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought a bill to save her government
 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit ke daayre se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government and are doing so constitutionally
 shila dikshit ne raashtrapati ko vidheyak dobaaraa bheja or dastakhat ho gaya
 This did not happen to Arvind Kejriwal
 un par aarope lag rahaa he ki retrospective se koi kanoon nahin lagu hota
 Constitutional expert PDT Acharya says that many states made the appointment first and then later made that law out of the purview of the post of profit and the court accepted it
 jaise rajasthan ke congress vidhayak kanta kathuria kaa ek maamla he
 Is of 1969
 is cese main hua ki kanta cathuria kii laabh ke pad par niyukti hui
 The High Court canceled his membership due to the Office of Profit
 supreme court main apil daayar hui tab vidhansabha ne kanoon paas kar unke pad ko laabh ke daayre se hi baahar kar diya
 The Supreme Court did not cancel the membership on this basis
 court ne kaha ki artical 191 main aisa kahin nahin likhaa he jisase pataa chalata he ki yah ghoshnaa retrospective effect se nahin ho sakati yani aap niyukti karne ke baad kanoon nahin bana sakate, aisa kahin nahin he
 a similar bill was also passed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 phir arvind kejariwal sarkaar kaa banaaya kanoon kyon nahin maanya he
 What is the office of profit corruption, is it a matter of constitutional ethics, then every state should have the same scale
 agar yah sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to har jagah ek hoga yaa alag-alag rajya kii sanvaidhanik naitikta alag-alag hogi
 There is a lot of confusion in this case
 haryana main bhi 4 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya
 On 18 July 2017, the Punjab Haryana High Court canceled the appointment
 50 hazaar selary milti thi or 1 lakh se zyaada bhatta miltaa tha

 There are ten parliamentary secretaries in Rajasthan who have been given the status of Minister of State
 kya yah koi karpshan he, kya inaki sadsyta ja rahi he, chunaav ayog kuch kar rahaa he, mere paas koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 There is one more case
 mamata banerjee ne dobaaraa satta main aane se pehle 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha

 kolkata hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke banaae kanoon ko radd kar diya
 The appointment of 24 mlas was also canceled

 Two months after that, in May 2015, the Raman Singh government appoints 11 mlas in Chhattisgarh as parliamentary secretaries
 chhattisgarh kaa faisla aaj tak nahin aayaa, dilli kaa aa gaya
 On 1 August 2017, the New Indian Express has published that the Chhattisgarh High Court has decided that the rights of all the secretaries should be revoked
 hoicourt ne kaha ki agar inaki niyukti garvanar se nahin hui he to inaki niyukti vaid nahin maani jaaegi

 27 june 2017 kii ek khabar mili
 From Telegraph and Times of India
 uske anusaar chunaav ayog ne madhya pradesh sarkaar se jawaab maanga he ki kya 109 vidhayak or 9 mantri offis of profit ke daayre main aate hai
 The comments aam aadmi party kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne madhyapradesh se poocha tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party's complaint was that 116 mlas were members of the Jan Bhagidari Samiti, which is a post of profit and two ministers were appointed commissioners of Scouts and Guides
 kya bijli mantri paras jain or schuli shiksha mantri deepak joshi ne laabh ke pad kaa ulanghan kiya he
 We do not know when the Election Commission has taken the final stand in terms of the post of profit in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 sadsyta radd hone kii khabar sunne ke baad aap ke kuch vidhayak dilli hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne chunaav ayog se aadesh ke bare main poocha to chunaav ayog ke vakil ne kaha ki abhi der shaam ko chunaav ayog se unka sampark nahin ho sakaa he or unhen samay diya jaae 
 The High Court questioned the behavior of the mlas, saying that the mlas were under the guise of pending the case in court
 iske baad court ne koi bhi antarim aadesh dene se inkaar kar diya or ab maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 The Election Commission has sent its recommendation to the President on the membership of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party in the office of profit
 hamaare sahyogi hrydayesh joshi ke anusaar ayog kii sifarish ke baad raashtrapati ke paas dastakhat karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin rah jaataa he
 After that it can be challenged in the court itself
 is maamle kii time line dekh lete hai
 - On 13 March 2015, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appointed 21 mlas as Parliamentary Secretaries
 - 19 june 2015 ko vakil prashanth patel ne raashtrapati ke paas yachika di ki yah offis of proffit kaa maamla he, arthath in vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd honi chahie
 - On June 24, 2015, the Delhi Assembly passed the removal of disqualification amendment bill 2015 and sent it to the President
 - isamen back date se sansadeey sachivon ko offis of profit maamle main chhot dene kii baat kahi
 - On 13 June 2016, the President refused to sign the bill
 - 25 june 2016 ko centre sarkaar ne bill vidhansabha ko bhej diya
 Between 14 and 21 July 2016, the Election Commission held a personal hearing of 21 mlas
 - 8 sitambar 2016 ko dilli hoicourt ne 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya
 On September 8, 2016, the Election Commission issued a show cause notice to 21 mlas
 - 24 june 2017 ko chunaav ayog ne aap vidhayakon kii apil riject kar di
 On 9 October 2017, the Commission again issued notice asking the mlas for clarification
 - 19 janvari 2018 ko ayog ne sadsyta radd karne kii sifarish kar di
 The High Court quashed the appointment of these mlas that the Lieutenant Governor did not have the sign, hence illegal
 is par bahes hui ki jab niyukti hi avaidh thi to phir offis of profit kaa maamla kaise banataa he
 It was argued that even before the High Court considered it illegal, the AAP MLA was in that position
 ab doosraa sawaal he ki kya aap ke vidhayakon ne laabh liya, yani selary yaa bhatta
 It is argued that they had found the room and spent on the maintenance of the room
 par supreme court ke kai faislon main saaf-saaf kaha gaya he ki laabh kaa pad yani vidhayak ko laabh mil rahaa ho
 Whether the post of profit will be decided only by salary, it will not be from the scale of placing or removing them
 hamen nahin maaloom ki chunaav ayog ke paas kya tathy hai
 The matter of the post of profit has reached the Supreme Court many times and the court has given a clear explanation of what the posts of profit are
 21 agast 1954 ko loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar ne rajyasabha ke chairman se salaah kar offis of profit ke liye ek cameti banaai
 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava, due to which it is called Bhargava Committee
 ve hisar se saansad the
 The committee suggested that a bill should be cleared to clarify which post is beneficial and which is not
 pediti acharya ne apni kitaab main iske bare main likhaa he
 The Supreme Court has set some tests to determine the office of profit
 pehla test yah he ki offis he yaa nahin
 The second test is whether the profit was made or not
 sabase ahm test yah he ki kya sarkaar ne niyukti kii he
 Does the government pay the MLA, pay the allowance
 laabh ke pad ke peeche adarsh kalpana yah thi ki vidhayak duusare kaam na karen kyonki uskaa kaam sadan main hona or janata kii awaz uthaanaa he
 He should not be under the control of the government
 varanaa vah janata kii awaz nahin uthaa paaegaa
 But does this also apply in practical terms
 awwal to vidhansabhaon ke satr bhi bahut kam dinon ke hote hai
 Is it not a moral offense? yahi nahin, vidhayak sadan main wheep ke aadhaar par apni party ke liye vot karata he
 He is the representative of the people on paper but the vote is according to the whip of the party
 phir offis of profit kii kalpana kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Think for yourself
 ek baar pandicherry ke meyar pad par vidhayak kii niyukti ho gai
 This was considered by the Election Commission as the Office of Profit because many allowances were available
 magar ise offis of profit nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata tha
 Overall there is no valid interpretation of the Office of Profit
 2006 main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad die
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of Trans Yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought a bill to save her government
 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit ke daayre se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government and are doing so constitutionally
 shila dikshit ne raashtrapati ko vidheyak dobaaraa bheja or dastakhat ho gaya
 This did not happen to Arvind Kejriwal
 un par aarope lag rahaa he ki retrospective se koi kanoon nahin lagu hota
 Constitutional expert PDT Acharya says that many states made the appointment first and then later made that law out of the purview of the post of profit and the court accepted it
 jaise rajasthan ke congress vidhayak kanta kathuria kaa ek maamla he
 Is of 1969
 is cese main hua ki kanta cathuria kii laabh ke pad par niyukti hui
 The High Court canceled his membership due to the Office of Profit
 supreme court main apil daayar hui tab vidhansabha ne kanoon paas kar unke pad ko laabh ke daayre se hi baahar kar diya
 The Supreme Court did not cancel the membership on this basis
 court ne kaha ki artical 191 main aisa kahin nahin likhaa he jisase pataa chalata he ki yah ghoshnaa retrospective effect se nahin ho sakati yani aap niyukti karne ke baad kanoon nahin bana sakate, aisa kahin nahin he
 a similar bill was also passed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 phir arvind kejariwal sarkaar kaa banaaya kanoon kyon nahin maanya he
 What is the office of profit corruption, is it a matter of constitutional ethics, then every state should have the same scale
 agar yah sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to har jagah ek hoga yaa alag-alag rajya kii sanvaidhanik naitikta alag-alag hogi
 There is a lot of confusion in this case
 haryana main bhi 4 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya

 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava, due to which it is called Bhargava Committee
 ve hisar se saansad the
 The committee suggested that a bill should be cleared to clarify which post is beneficial and which is not
 pediti acharya ne apni kitaab main iske bare main likhaa he
 The Supreme Court has set some tests to determine the office of profit
 pehla test yah he ki offis he yaa nahin
 The second test is whether the profit was made or not
 sabase ahm test yah he ki kya sarkaar ne niyukti kii he
 Does the government pay the MLA, pay the allowance
 laabh ke pad ke peeche adarsh kalpana yah thi ki vidhayak duusare kaam na karen kyonki uskaa kaam sadan main hona or janata kii awaz uthaanaa he
 He should not be under the control of the government
 varanaa vah janata kii awaz nahin uthaa paaegaa
 But does this also apply in practical terms
 awwal to vidhansabhaon ke satr bhi bahut kam dinon ke hote hai
 Is it not a moral offense? yahi nahin, vidhayak sadan main wheep ke aadhaar par apni party ke liye vot karata he
 He is the representative of the people on paper but the vote is according to the whip of the party
 phir offis of profit kii kalpana kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he
 Think for yourself
 ek baar pandicherry ke meyar pad par vidhayak kii niyukti ho gai
 This was considered by the Election Commission as the Office of Profit because many allowances were available
 magar ise offis of profit nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata tha
 Overall there is no valid interpretation of the Office of Profit
 2006 main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad die
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of Trans Yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought a bill to save her government
 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit ke daayre se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government and are doing so constitutionally
 shila dikshit ne raashtrapati ko vidheyak dobaaraa bheja or dastakhat ho gaya
 This did not happen to Arvind Kejriwal
 un par aarope lag rahaa he ki retrospective se koi kanoon nahin lagu hota
 Constitutional expert PDT Acharya says that many states made the appointment first and then later made that law out of the purview of the post of profit and the court accepted it
 jaise rajasthan ke congress vidhayak kanta kathuria kaa ek maamla he
 Is of 1969
 is cese main hua ki kanta cathuria kii laabh ke pad par niyukti hui
 The High Court canceled his membership due to the Office of Profit
 supreme court main apil daayar hui tab vidhansabha ne kanoon paas kar unke pad ko laabh ke daayre se hi baahar kar diya
 The Supreme Court did not cancel the membership on this basis
 court ne kaha ki artical 191 main aisa kahin nahin likhaa he jisase pataa chalata he ki yah ghoshnaa retrospective effect se nahin ho sakati yani aap niyukti karne ke baad kanoon nahin bana sakate, aisa kahin nahin he
 a similar bill was also passed in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh
 phir arvind kejariwal sarkaar kaa banaaya kanoon kyon nahin maanya he
 What is the office of profit corruption, is it a matter of constitutional ethics, then every state should have the same scale
 agar yah sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to har jagah ek hoga yaa alag-alag rajya kii sanvaidhanik naitikta alag-alag hogi
 There is a lot of confusion in this case
 haryana main bhi 4 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya
 On 18 July 2017, the Punjab Haryana High Court canceled the appointment
 50 hazaar selary milti thi or 1 lakh se zyaada bhatta miltaa tha
 But did his membership go or not, but the appointment was canceled
 14 november 2017 ko times of india ne isaki khabar chhaapi he ki rajasthan hoicourt ne vahaan ke mukhya sachiv, pradhan sachiv or cabinet sachiv ko sansadeey sachiv ke maamle main notice jari kiya he
 There are ten parliamentary secretaries in Rajasthan who have been given the status of Minister of State
 kya yah koi karpshan he, kya inaki sadsyta ja rahi he, chunaav ayog kuch kar rahaa he, mere paas koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 There is one more case
 mamata banerjee ne dobaaraa satta main aane se pehle 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 Laws were also brought but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kolkata hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke banaae kanoon ko radd kar diya
 The appointment of 24 mlas was also canceled
 march 2015 ko dilli ke 21 vidhayak sansadeey sachiv banate hai
 Two months after that, in May 2015, the Raman Singh government appoints 11 mlas in Chhattisgarh as parliamentary secretaries
 chhattisgarh kaa faisla aaj tak nahin aayaa, dilli kaa aa gaya
 On 1 August 2017, the New Indian Express has published that the Chhattisgarh High Court has decided that the rights of all the secretaries should be revoked
 hoicourt ne kaha ki agar inaki niyukti garvanar se nahin hui he to inaki niyukti vaid nahin maani jaaegi
 a similar decision was given by the court regarding the mlas of Delhi
 27 june 2017 kii ek khabar mili
 From Telegraph and Times of India
 uske anusaar chunaav ayog ne madhya pradesh sarkaar se jawaab maanga he ki kya 109 vidhayak or 9 mantri offis of profit ke daayre main aate hai
 The comments aam aadmi party kii shikaayat par chunaav ayog ne madhyapradesh se poocha tha
 The Aam Aadmi Party's complaint was that 116 mlas were members of the Jan Bhagidari Samiti, which is a post of profit and two ministers were appointed commissioners of Scouts and Guides
 kya bijli mantri paras jain or schuli shiksha mantri deepak joshi ne laabh ke pad kaa ulanghan kiya he
 We do not know when the Election Commission has taken the final stand in terms of the post of profit in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 sadsyta radd hone kii khabar sunne ke baad aap ke kuch vidhayak dilli hoicourt gaye, hoicourt ne chunaav ayog se aadesh ke bare main poocha to chunaav ayog ke vakil ne kaha ki abhi der shaam ko chunaav ayog se unka sampark nahin ho sakaa he or unhen samay diya jaae 
 The High Court questioned the behavior of the mlas, saying that the mlas were under the guise of pending the case in court
 iske baad court ne koi bhi antarim aadesh dene se inkaar kar diya or ab maamle kii sunwaayee somvaar ko hogi
 The ideal idea behind the post of profit was that mlas should not do other work because their job is to be in the house and raise the voice of the public
 vah sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin hona chahie
 Otherwise he will not be able to raise public voice
 par kya yah vyaavhaarik rup main bhi lagu hota he
 First, the sessions of the assemblies are also very short
 kya yah naitik aparaadh nahin he
 Not only this, the MLA votes for his party on the basis of whip in the House
 vah janata kaa pratinidhi kaagaj par hota he magar vot party ke wheep ke hisaab se hota he
 Then what does the imagination of office of profit mean
 aap khud bhi sochie
 Once the MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 ise chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But it was not considered an office of profit because the post of mayor was not under the control of the government
 kul milakar offis of profit kii koi ek maanya vyakhya nahin milti he
 In 2006, Sheila Dikshit gave a variety of posts to the 19 Congress mlas
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans yamuna aria deveopment board ke chairman, vaais chairman ke
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent notice of office of profit to 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek vidheyak le ain
 14 offices were excluded from the purview of office of profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he or sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Sheila Dixit sent the bill again to the President and was signed
 arvind kejariwal ke saath aisa nahin hua
 They are being accused that no law from retrospective applies
 samvidhan visheshgy pediti acharya kehete hai ki kai rajyon ne pehle niyukti kii or phir baad main kanoon banaakar us pad ko laabh ke pad ke daayre se baahar kiya or adaalat ne bhi mana
 Like there is a case of Congress MLA from Rajasthan Kanta Kathuria
 1969 kaa he
 It was in this case that Kanta Kathuria was appointed to the post of profit
 hoicourt ne offis of profit ke kaaran unki sadsyta radd kar di
 When the appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, the Legislative Assembly passed the law and excluded his post from the purview of profit
 supreme court ne is aadhaar par sadsyta radd nahin kii
 The court said that no such article has been written in article 191, which shows that this declaration cannot be made with retrospective effect, ie you cannot make a law after making an appointment, there is no such thing
 isi tarah kaa bill jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi paas hua
 Then why the law made by Arvind Kejriwal government is not valid
 kya offis of profit karpshan he, kya sanvaidhanik naitikta kaa maamla he to phir har rajya main ek hi paimaana hona chahie
 If it is a matter of constitutional morality then there will be one everywhere or the constitutional ethics of different state will be different
 is maamle main bahut kanfusion dikhataa he
 In Haryana also 4 mlas were made Parliamentary Secretaries
 18 july 2017 ko punjab haryana hoicourt ne niyukti radd kar di
 Used to get 50 thousand salary and more than 1 lakh allowance
 lekin kya inaki sadsyta gai, nahin gai magar niyukti radd ho gai
 On 14 November 2017, the Times of India published a report that the Rajasthan High Court has issued a notice to the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary and Cabinet Secretary in the matter of Parliamentary Secretary
 rajasthan main das sansadeey sachiv banaae gaye hai jinhen rajya mantri kaa darja diya gaya he
 Is this a corruption, is it going to the membership, is the Election Commission doing anything, i have no firm information
 ek maamla or he
 Mamata Banerjee had made 24 mlas as Parliamentary Secretaries before coming back to power
 kanoon bhi lekar ain magar 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar ho gai
 The Kolkata High Court struck down the law made by Mamta Banerjee
 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti bhi radd ho gai
 On March 2015, 21 mlas of Delhi become Parliamentary Secretaries
 uske do maheene baad may 2015 main chhattisgarh main 11 vidhayakon ko raman singh sarkaar sansadeey sachiv banaati he
 The decision of Chhattisgarh has not come till today, Delhi has come
 1 agast 2017 ko new indian express ne chapa he ki chhattisgarh hai court ne faisla diya he ki sabhi sasandiy sachivon ke adhikaar radd kar die jaaen
 The High Court said that if they are not appointed by the Governor, then their appointment will not be considered valid
 isi tarah kaa faisla to dilli ke vidhayakon ke bare main court ne diya tha
 a news of 27 June 2017 was received
 telegraph or times of india se
 According to him, the Election Commission has sought an answer from the Madhya Pradesh government whether 109 mlas and 9 ministers fall under the purview of Office of Profit
 tippaniyan Madhya Pradesh was asked by the Election Commission on the complaint of the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party kii shikaayat thi ki 116 vidhayak janabhagidaari samiti ke sadsy the, jo laabh kaa pad he or do mantriyon ko scout and guide kaa ayukta niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Has Power Minister Paras Jain and School Education Minister Deepak Joshi violated the post of profit
 chunaav ayog ne madhyapradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main laabh ke pad ke maamle main kya antim rukh liya he, kab legaa, hamen nahin pataa
 After hearing the news of the cancellation of membership, some of the AAP mlas went to the Delhi High Court, when the High Court asked the Election Commission about the order, the Election Commission counsel said that they could not get in touch with the Election Commission in the late evening and they had time
 Be given

 The Facebook / Cambridge Analytica scandal is only a few days old, but the issue is about the year 2013 / 2014
 cambridge analitica ne cambridge uniwarsity ke ek ecchemic alexander kogaan ko ek aise ap ke vikaas kaa kaam saunpa tha, jiskaa istemaal fasebuk yugers ke bich persenelity quij jaisaa survey ke liye kiya ja sake
 Nearly 2,70,000 Americans downloaded the app and participated in the survey
 unhone ap ko apane doston ke like or coment tak bhi acces de diya
 Using this technology, the app acquired data of a total of 5 crore people
 data ko cambridge analitica ke saath bhi share kiya gaya
 Cambridge Analytica is a consulting company that provides services to political parties and think tanks who need to create profiles and connect with people
 cambridge analitica ke data kii madad se ye sanghathan ab nagarikon kii kuch nishchit manyataon or vichaaron ke aadhaar par baariki se lakshith kar sakate the—iske liye vivaran fasebuk data se hasil kiya gaya tha
 Now the question is, how is it possible to get Facebook's data in the first phase? Basically the user used to download the quiz app and took part in the quiz
 jab bhi ham koi ap install karte hai to yah aapse aapke fasebuk data tak pahunch dene kii ijaajat maangata he or zyaadaatar aisa hota he ki log iske nattejey ko samajhe bina turant "yes'' par clic kar dete hai
 So in this way when the user gives such permission to an app, Facebook also allows that app to scan its data
 cambridge analitica ke maamle main fasebuk ne saal 2015 main is par roak laga di, jab use is ap kaa khel or yah data kisalie istemaal ho rahaa tha, isaki jaankaree mili
 Facebook also requested Cambridge Analytica to delete the data acquired in this way, but Cambridge Analytica does not seem to have done so
 isaki jagah, lagata to aisa he ki usne is data kaa istemaal apane graahakon ko vibhinn tarah kii sevaayen dene ke liye kiya
 So the question arises whether it will be called data theft, because after all the user gave permission to the app for this? Or is it a case of ambush with confidence, in which the user believed that his data was private and Facebook would not share it with anyone else? Did Facebook give its users complete information about how their and their friends' data is being used for their profiling and influencing them? Now we are entering a world in which data is exploding Used to be
 ham khud har second baari maatra main data paidaa kar rahe hai, jaise jab ham internet browjing karte hai, kuch search karte hai, i-mail istemaal karte hai, i-commers site par kuch order karte hai, online tikat kharidte hai, online banking yaa credit card tranjaction karte hai, aadi
 And in future, we are going to be monitored with such Internet of Things (iot), which will be on our side and many times it can happen in our body
 vah niztaa, jise abhi tak ham jaanate rahe hai, uski digital duniya main maut ho chuki he
 Using data we can monitor people and their behavior can be estimated to a large extent
 isi vajah se kuch log ab "data ko nayaa tel'' maan rahe hai
 We should talk about our data "data rights"
 ham yah saaf dekh chuke hai ki hamaare bare main data kaa durupyog ho saktaa he, yahaan tak ki yah aadhunik samaaj kii buniyaad-uski loktantric sansthaaon ko bhi hilaa sakati he

 This article is a compilation of some funny and funny events that took place during the Round Table Conference which are associated with Mahatma Gandhi
 baat san 1931 kii he
 The freedom movement was raging in India, Gandhi's Salt Satyagraha had been completed and Bhagat Singh had been hanged
 british sarkaar duusare golmes kii taiyaari main vyast thi or use kaamyaab bananaa chaahati thi
 Since Gandhi had not participated in the first round table, it proved to be a flop show and that is why the British wanted Gandhi to attend that round table conference
 idhar gandhi aakhri samay tak golmes main apni shirkat ko lekar angrejon chakaana chaahate the
 British intelligence agents, journalists and political activists used to attend Gandhi's programs every day and try to get some news whether Gandhi would attend the second round table conference
 But Gandhi was not allowing anyone to get a cloak! In the summer of the same year, when the sun was setting fire, one day, in the midst of his daily activities, suddenly asked Kasturba - Ba, get the clothes ready! a young journalist heard this and informed the news agencies that Mahatma was going to participate in the Second Round Table Conference
 kyonki bharat main us samay bheeshan garmi pad rahi thi or garam kapade taiyaar karwaane kaa sawaal hi nahin tha
 The need for warm clothes could have been needed in London itself
 us noujvaan patrkaar kaa naam tha durgadas
 It was there Durgadas who later became the editor of a newspaper like Hindustan Times and later who played the main role in the establishment of the Press Club
 duusare golmes sammelan kii asafalataa or gandhi kaa usamen angrejon se virodh kii kahani jagajaahir he
 But two or three interesting incidents happened during Gandhi's visit to London which have not found much place in history
 gandhi ne apni us yatra kaa istemaal har us manch ko hasil karne main kiya jahaan vah bharat kii aazaadee ke prashn ko duniya ke saamne rakh sakate the
 In this connection, he met opposition leaders in England, non-governmental organizations, the British press and every person who could meet him
 sirf winston churchill unase nahin mili jo gandhi ko pasand nahin karte the
 But Gandhiji definitely got time to meet George v from the British Emperor
 samraat ke secretary ne gandhi ko sakht taakid kii thi wo sahi tareeke se kapade pahanakar samraat ke saamne upasthit hon or protocol kaa khyaal rakhen
 But Gandhi deliberately did not follow him and he went to meet the emperor disguised as a fakir
 gandhi or british samraat kii wo mulaakaat monolog hi thi, unhen iktarafa jorge pancham se bharat main ashaanti failaane ke aaropon ko sunanaa padaa or naseehaten bhi mili
 Gandhi smiled and told the emperor that he is teaching the Indian public the lesson of non-violence which is his ancient lifestyle
 khayr, us sankshipt mulaakaat ke baad jab gandhi mahal se baahar nikle to british press ne unhen gher liya or tarah-tarah ke sawaal puche
 a journalist told sarcastically that- "mr
 Gandhi, you have been in England
 kam se kam kapade to aapako sahi tareeke se pahanakar janaa chahie tha
 Should have been presented before the Emperor in a civilized manner ”
 is par gandhi kaa jawaab tha- mere hisse kaa kapadaa to samraat ne pahan rakhaa tha!press ko kaato to khun nahin! gandhi ke aise jawaab ko chhapane kii himmat bahut kam akhbaar kar paae!gandhi kii us yatra main kisi vyakti ne unki mulaakaat angreji filmon ke mashhoor star charlie chaplin se tay karvaa di
 Charlie praised Gandhi's efforts for India's independence and asked Gandhi why he was so suspicious about machines? Gandhi replied that he is not opposed to machines but he is opposed to exploitation of one human being by machines because of machines
 america-europe ke audyogic maahaul main paley-bade charlie chaplin ko us samay ye baaten samaj main nahin ain
 But four years later, in 1936, Charlie produced, directed and acted in a film called "modern Times"
 us film main mashin, berogari or ek manushya ke sangharsh ko maarmik tareeke se dikhalaayaa gaya he
 After many years, the biographer of Charlie Chaplin wrote that perhaps five years ago, the meeting with Gandhi in London had the effect that a great filmmaker like Charlie had made that film called Modern Times
 landan kii us shaam hindustan kaa wo fakir us filmi superstar par baari pad gaya tha!to mahatma gandhi aise the jinka prabhaav us jamaane ke bade-bade superstaron or samraaton par bhi bakhubi padaa tha
 US President Barack Obama has written a letter to Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai apologizing for the incident of burning the Bagram airbase Holy Quran and apologized for the incident

 com / dxfj6npnd5— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 28, 2019 After paying tribute to Bapu and Atal, Modi reached the National Summer Memorial and saluted the martyrs
 unhone isi saal 26 farvari ko rashtriya samar smarak kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 He was accompanied by the outgoing Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the heads of the three armies
 dilli ke kareeb greater noida main pichley do maheene main 19 ladakiyon kaa katl ho chukaa he
 And these 19 dead bodies are just asking a question
 main koun-- meraa kaatil koun? kya he ye murder mistry?desh kii rajdhani dilli se bilkul kareeb greater noida main do janvari se rahasyamayi katl kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua he wo 19 kii ginati par jaakar bhi khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 In these two months, on an average, every second, fourth and sixth day, one corpse is definitely coming out
 laash wo bhi sirf ladakiyon or auraton kii
 19 zombies craving identity make this creepy truth even more frightening
 Police of Greater Noida ji haa
 Despite collecting 19 corpses in two months, leave the motive for the murderer or murder, the police have not been able to find the faces or even their names
 19 kii 19 laashon aaj bhi apni pahchaan ko taras rahi hai
 So to know the truth of this serial murder, the team of crime also started their investigation
 hamaari team ne un sabhi thikaanon kii jaankaree ikatthi kerani shuru kar di jahaan-jahaan se laashen mil rahi thim
 We found some strange things after the investigation
 masalan- sabhi laashen 15 se 20 kilometre ke daayre main milin- par laashen alag-alag jagahon par phenki gayi- maarane kaa tareeqa bhi alag-alag tha- kuch ko galaa ghont kar maaraa gaya to kuch ko pathar se kuchal kar- kuch laashen kapadon main milin to kuch ardhangn- kuch laashon ke paas se saamaan bhi mili- par kisi laash ke paas se uski pahchaan se judi koi chiz nahin mili- zyaadaatar laashon ke chehre bhi jala die gaye the- yani qaatil unki pahchaan mitaanaa chahta hailaashon kaa koi daavedaar nahinpar sabase chaunkaane vaali cheez ye thi ki greater noida ke aasapaas ke tamaam gaanvon or kasbon ko khangaal maarane ke baavjood ek bhi aisa ghar nahin mila jahaan se pichley do maheene ke andar koi ladki gaayab hui he
 Even police stations in nearby districts were searched
 magar koi gamshuda aisi nahi mili jo makatool se milti he
 Now the question arises as to whether all the dead bodies or all the maktools are remote? But how far? Can anyone bring dead bodies from far-flung areas like eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand? Is that possible? Or is there a madman who fraudulently brings girls here and kills them from far and wide? Why did different people do all these killings for different reasons? Or is it that the murderer is not killing in different ways to confuse the police? a series of serial killings that began on January 2 begins on January 2 this year
 jab pehali ladki kii laash milti he
 Initially, the police feel that the matter is of general murder
 usee hisaab se wo maamle kii jaanch bhi karti he
 But then another corpse is found
 phir teesri, phir chauthi, phir paanchavin
 And the last corpse meets on March 8
 or iske saath hi laashon kii ginati pahunch jaati he 19 tak
 2 January 2014, the second day of the year
 greater noida ke gadhi pushte ilaake se pehali laash milti he
 Lash was of a girl
 subah-subah laash milane kii khabar ne police ko bhi pareshaan kar diya or wo fouran mauka e vaardaat kii taraf bhaagi
 
 
 But after seeing the condition of the corpse, his footsteps stopped
 
 
 ye laash behad puraani or sadi-gali haalat main thi, jabaki jahaan ye laash padi thi, wo ek biji road tha
 The corpse was in a very bad condition, so there was a big question before the police
 sawaal ye ki akhir itani biji road par ek laash itane dinon se kaise padi hui thi? kisi kii nazar kyon nahin padi? yaa phir puraani laash kisi ne yahaan laakar daali? is laash kii paheli ko sulajhane ke liye police ne use postmortem ke liye bhijwa diya
 But the police got another shock when the forensic medicine experts told him that the condition of the corpse was so bad that it was not possible to find out the reason for his death only by post mortem
 lekin ye to bas shuruyaat thi
 It was not even a week before the first corpse was found that the police found the corpse of another girl on a footpath in Sector 24, Greater Noida
 
 
 is laash kii haalat itani buree to nahin thi, lekin qaatil ne makatool kii pahchaan chhipaane ke iraade se uske chehre ko hi jala diya tha
 The police also made every effort to find out the story behind this corpse, but to no avail
 kuch laashon kaa cheharaa buree tarah jala huachand rose guzarate hai tabhi ek or laash saamne aa jaati he
 The corpse belonged to a pregnant woman, who was found in a park near Pari Chowk
 aam taur par ye park har vakt logon se gulzaar rahata he
 In such a situation, finding the corpse of a pregnant woman in a park among this stuffed population was nothing less than an enigma
 lekin greater noida main ladakiyon kii laashon ke milane kaa ye silsilaa kabhi naa khatm honevaala ek rahasyamayi silsilaa ban kar rah jayega, kisi ko bhi iskaa gumaan nahin tha
 But something similar happened after that
 
 
 agle maheene yani pehali farvari se lekar aath march tak greater noida main is tarah ek-ek kar kul 19 laashen milin
 
 
 And surprisingly, the police could not get a single clue about all these 19 dead bodies, which would have reached the killer
 balki suraag kii chhodie police 19 qatl ke maamalon main ek bhi maranevaali kii pahchaan tak nahin kar saki he
 On the contrary, with every new case, the process of getting the dead bodies of girls is becoming increasingly complicated
 kahin laash bagaiyr kapadon kii hoti, to kahin cheharaa buree tarah jala hua or har baar qaatil laashon ko nipta kar bhaagane main kaamyaab hota rahaa
 At first, the hands of the police, who took the matter lightly, are now thriving with increasing numbers
 ek saath itane blind murder ke maamalon ne jaise use ulajhaa kar rakh diya he
 So is this murder the work of a serial killer who hates girls? And each time kills its victim in a different way
 
 
 noida or greater noida police kii chah timen ab inhen sawaalon kaa jawaab talashne main juty hai

" Might be possible

 After the exit poll, just as the opposition camp has been in a tizzy, in the same way, the speculative market is also in a bind
 bade nuksaan se bachane ke liye satorie chunaav ke dauraan khule bhaavon ko band kar ab sirf bijepi or congress kii siton par hi satta le rahe hai
 Once the exit poll of all the channels appears, the BJP has started making laddoos once again, and like the opposition, the speculative market is also in the mood
 isliye ab pehle ke sabhi satton par boli band kar sirf bijepi or congress ko kitni siten milengi us par satta lag rahaa he
 According to Satta Bazaar, BJP can bring seats from 260 to 262, while the Congress which was bringing seats from 80 to 90 has now reduced from 68 to 70
 jabaki iske pehle sattabazar main bhaajapa kaa bhav akele dam par sarkaar banane par bhi khulaa tha jo 3 rupee 50 paise tha
 Whereas the formation of NDA government was only 12 paise
 vahiin congress ko 272 siten milane par 100 rupye kaa bhav to upie ke sarkaar banane par 50 rupye kaa bhav tha

 isliye wo apana napha nuksaan dekh kar hi bhav kholte hai
 Not only the grand alliance, but even the open speculation for the post of Prime Minister has been closed because the bookies also feel that Narendra Modi is set to become the Prime Minister
 jabaki agsit pole ke pehle pradhanmantri pad ke liye narendra modi kaa bhav 15 paise, rahul gandhi kaa 60 rupye, mayawati kaa 110 rupye to mamata banerjee ke liye 150 rupye kaa bhav khulaa tha

 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter rajya main vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ek saath 10 april or 17 april ko hue
 This election was entirely focused on two questions
 pehla, kya record chauthi baar orissa ke mukhyamantri banane kii chaah rakhane vaale naveen patnayak itihaas banane main kaamyaab ho paaenge? doosraa, kya narendra modi kii lahar rajya main bijepi ko kuch siten dilaane main kaamyaab rahegi, jahaan 2009 main party kaa khaataa bhi nahin khul paaya tha?aakhirkaar 16 may ko us samay is bahes kaa ant ho gaya jab naveen kii biju janata dal (bijedy) ko vidhansabha main aasaan jeet mili or usne rajya kii 21 loksabhaa siton main se 19 apane khate main kar leen
 The Congress has been marginalized by securing just 18 seats in the state assembly, while it has not got even one seat in the Lok Sabha
 duusari ore, bijepi ko 11 vidhansabha or 2 loksabhaa siton par jeet mili
 After a long wait for the election results, it was finally clear that Naveen has defeated the Modi wave and any anti-incumbency wave
 unki yah jeet vastav main sukhad he kyonki na sirf 2009 ke vidhansabha main 103 siton or loksabhaa main 14 siton se ve aage bade hai, balki ve 2014 main tamaam jhjhavaaton se nipatate hue kaddavar netaa ke rup main ubhare hai
 Naveen single-handedly scripted his fourth consecutive win
 unke aalochak bhi yah baat maanate hai kyonki kabhi naveen ke ‘chanakya’ kahe jane vaale afasar se netaa bane pyaari mohan mahapaatr bhi unka saath chhod chuke hai
 Even before 2012, the Chief Minister had allowed Mahapatra to play openly, thereby emerging as a parallel power center
 haalanki, naveen jab kaaphi dur landan main the to unki satta palatney kii koshish kii gai jo vifal rahi
 After this, Naveen suspended Mahapatra in June 2012, showing agility
 mahapaatr ko aakhirkaar party se baahar kar diya gaya, is tarah naveen kaa ek aise shaks se 12 saal kaa rishta khatm ho gaya jo yah daawa karte the ki unhone mukhyamantri ko raajnneeti kaa kakehara sikhaaya he
 Mahapatra formed his own political party Odisha Jan Morcha (OJM) and kept on fire against Naveen and the BJD, but after being zeroed in both the assembly and the Lok Sabha, he may now be completely isolated
 naveen ne ek aise vyakti ke rup main rajnatik kariyar shuru kiya, jinhen oriya kaa dharapravaah vaktaa nahin mana jaataa tha or jinako saarvajanik jivan kaa shaayad hi koi anubhav tha
 They have come a long way in reaching this way
 67 saal ke is kunvaare netaa ne pichley varshon main orissa main raajnneeti kii paribhaasha badal di he
 Despite assuming the political legacy of his father Biju Patnaik, Naveen has nothing to take care of his family's interests
 march 2000 main jab ve pehali baar mukhyamantri bane to orissa ko nitant garib rajya mana jaataa tha, jahaan 1999-2000 main prati vyakti aay mahaj 14,862 ru
 was
 yah ab badhkar 2011-12 main 26,900 ru
 Has reached sitambar, 2013 main rigerv bank ne orissa ko nae projects ke liye investment kaa sabase aakarshak thikaana bataaya
 By running schemes aimed at women, she ensured that the Congress never returned to power, which was out of power in 2000 in the state
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad lagaataar orissa main sarkaar chalaane vaale naveen ne satta virdohi lahar se nipatane ke liye jamini str par janata kii apeksha ke anukool shashan diya kyonki ve jaanate the ki aaj ke daur kii raajnneeti saanp-seedhi kaa khel he
 In the case of being the longest-serving Chief Minister in India, he has just lagged behind veteran CPM veteran Jyoti Basu
 kabhi rajnatik rup se nausikhia (naveen) kahe jane vaale mukhyamantri ek baar phir bijedy kii jeet kii aguwai karne ke baad kushal ranneetikaar maane jane lage hai
 The party has now entered its 17th year and its 14th year in power
 vah pehle se bhi majboot ho gai he
 Unlike other family leaders, Naveen started his political career after the death of his father in 1997
 ve america se waapas aae or 26 disambar, 1997 ko bijedy kii sthapana kii
 Opponents mocked him, even mocking his party's election symbol (conch)
 lekin unhone rajya kaa jis tarah se kayapalat kiya uski vajah se kabhi unke mukhar aalochak rahe damodar raut ko unke saath aana padaa
 Raut is currently the health minister of the state
 khud kii chhavi garibon ke himachati ke rup main rachane vaale naveen ek kathor badla lene vaale bhi hai
 Naveen rarely forgets his enemies
 shuruaati dinon main unhone party ke sah-sansthaapak or aalochak bijay mahapaatr ko hataakar 2000 main patkuda vidhansabha seat se unki jagah atanu sabyasachi ko bijedy ummidavaar bana diya or mahapaatr ko party se baahar kar diya
 Bijay still has not recovered from this setback
 patkuda se 2004 or 2009 main do baar chunaav haarane ke baad ve 2014 main bijepi ummidavaar ke rup main mahakalpada seat par chale gaye the
 Over the years, Naveen has worked very closely in dealing with his opponents
 march 2009 main aam chunaavon ke thik pehle unhone bijepi se bijedy kaa 12 saal purana gathbandhan tod diya
 Naveen termed it as communal based on bjp's alleged role in promoting the 2008 Kandhamal riots
 antim samay main bijedy ke saath chhod dene se bijepi badahaal ho gai thi or 2009 main vah ek bhi loksabhaa seat jeet paane main asafal rahi jabaki 147 sadasyeey vidhansabha main use mahaj chah siten hi mil sakin
 Naveen's administrative fame was further heightened in October 2013 when he effectively evacuated more than one lakh people in Ganjam, Puri and Khurda districts en route to Phailin cyclone
 unki tatparta or pehle se yojana bananaa giradhar gamang ke netritv vaali congress kii sarkaar kii tulana main bilkul vipareet baat thi, jiske shashan ke dauraan aktubar, 1999 main orissa main super cyclone aane se 10,000 se zyada logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Time has always been very important in Naveen Patnaik's strategy
 is baar dohare chunaav kii taiyaari main unhone chaturaai dikhaate hue bijedy ke 35 vidhayakon ko tikat nahin diya taaki unke khilaaf janata ke gusse kaa koi asar na ho
 They did not stop here, by bringing leaders like Jeetu Patnaik, Bimbadhar Kunar, Golak Nayak, Hema Gamang and Sarat Mishra from other parties, they weakened those parties and also increased their base
 aise main jab bijepi baari jeet ke saath sarkaar banane ja rahi he, dilli main naveen kya karenge is bare main abhi unhone apane pattey nahin khole hai
 However, one thing is certain: Odisha is in Naveen's bag and looks likely to remain so even further

 He wanted the girl to get a good life which he was unable to give

 Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said that Army Chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and the country's intelligence agency 'inter Services Intelligence' (ISI) chief Suja Pasha would not be removed from their posts
 pradhanmantri ke is bayaan ke baad donon pramukhon ko pad se hataane sambandhi afvaahon par viraam lag gaya he

 Around 5,000 nurses are on leave at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi on Friday
 unka kahana he ki agar unki maangen puri nahin kii gai to wo anischitkaal hadtaal karengi
 Employees want a permanent solution to be found
 unka kahana he ki agar doctoron ko saatven vetan ayog kaa laabh mil saktaa he to ham karmchaariyon ko kyon nahin?nursonke ek saath avkaash par chale jane se aspataal main apatkaaleen sevaayen prabhavit hai or logon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Although OPD and other medical services continue regularly
 27 march se anischitkaal hadtaal parkarmchaariyon ke union netaa harish kaa kahana he ki hamanen 15 din pehle hi aspataal main notice de diya tha ki sabhi karmchaaree shuukravaar yani 17 march ko ek din ki chuttee par rahenge
 Now if the matter is not done today, then we will go on strike once again on 27th March
 unka kahana he ki marizon ko agar takalif he thospatalko sochna chahie
 What is the demand? Overall the two most important demands of the employees
 pehali ye ki vetan bhatte main badhotaree kii jaae
 It should be increased to Rs 7800
 doosraa pe scale ko 4800 se badhaakar 5400 rupee kiya jaae
 If the demands of the employees are not met, then the situation may worsen
 kyonki ames ek aisa aspataal he jahaan deshbhar se log ilaaj karwaane aate hai or aise main hadtaal se hazaron marizon ko pareshaani hogi

 isamen mahilaayein bhi shaamil hai
 These have been given whistles, which they always keep with them
 samiti ke sadsy jab bhi kisi ko shouch ke liye baahar jate dekhte hai, fouran siti bajaane lagate hai
 This prevents the person from doing so again
 iskaa asar bhi ho rahaa he
 In this regard, Chief Executive Officer of Zilla Panchayat Chandan Kumar said that being aware of cleanliness is the need of the hour
 yah bahut acchhee pahal he
 Other gram panchayats around it will also follow
 yadi yojana safal ho jaati he to musurputta ko puraskaar dene par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Many of the experiments conducted earlier, Mussurputta has a population of about 2200

 They were given the responsibility to keep an eye on those taken out of the toilet
