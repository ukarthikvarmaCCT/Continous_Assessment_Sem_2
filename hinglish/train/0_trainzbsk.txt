 muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki muslim vahaan par namaaj padhate the, is par sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he
 The way the idol was placed on the site on the night of 22-23 December is not correct according to Hindu rule
 dhawan ne kaha ki 40 gavaahon kii gavaahi ko cross ikjamination nahin kiya gaya
 The petition of Gopal Singh Visharad also did not mention the birthplace of Lord Rama
 masjid ke bich ke gumbad ke neeche janmasthan hone kaa daawa kiya gaya or puja ke adhikaar kii maang kii gai
 Dhawan said that Justice Sudhir Aggarwal had believed that worship was done on the Ram platform
 dhawan ne hoicourt ke ek jaj ke objarveshan kaa virodh kiya jinhone kaha tha ki muslim vahaan par apana kabja sabit nahin kar paae the
 Dhawan said that we oppose it, we were in possession there
 unhone sheethal dube kii report kaa zikr kiya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki masjid ke parisar main havan or puja hoti thi or namaaj nahin hoti thi
 On this, Dhawan said that she can be a havan and also worship
 is report main yah nahin kaha gaya ki puja or havan masjid ke andruni angan main hoti thi
 Dhawan was trying to prove that the mosque was occupied by the Muslim side by referring to several old petitions related to the Ayodhya dispute
 dhawan ne kaha ki mutavalli ne arzi daakhil kii thi jis par sarkaar ne aadesh diya tha
 If the mosque is not occupied by Muslims, then why should they apply for a motive and the government give the decision
 isse sabit hota he ki masjid par muslimon kaa kabza tha
 He said that Mohammad Python had applied for possession of the cemetery
 rajeev dhawan ne hindu paksh ke ek gavaah kaa bayaan padhate hue kaha ki bhagwaan ram kii murti garbh grih main nahin thi
 There was no picture of God inside the sanctum sanctorum, but even then those who came to worship went towards the railing and went towards the sanctum sanctorum
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki garbh grih ke bheetar kabhi puja nahin hui
 a wrongly placed idol cannot be claimed
 ayodhya maamle main muslim paksh kii taraf se rajeev dhawan ne bahes puri kar lee
 On behalf of the Muslim side, Zafaryab Jilani argued in the Supreme Court that there is a belief of birth of Ram at the birthplace, but not evidence
 unhone kaha ki ramcharita maanas or valmiki ramayana, yah to yachikakartaon ko sabit karnaa he ki or koun-koun si kitabon main zikr he! maanas or ramayana main kahin vishisht taur par ram janm sthaan kaa koi zikr nahin
 Before 1949, there is no existence or evidence of Ram birth, worship under the middle dome
 justise bobade ne poocha ki aap yah saboot bhi denge ki 1949 se pehle vahaan niyamit namaaz hoti thi? jilani ne kaha iske likhit nahin zabaani saboot hai
 Justice Ashok Bhushan said that even on the Hindu side, Ram is mentioned in the Ramayana and Manas in the Dasharatha Mahal in Ayodhya but not the place
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki donon granthon main ayodhya main ramajanm kaa zikr he
 What does it mean to claim Ram's birthplace anywhere in Ayodhya? Jilani said that Ram is not older than the Chabutara temple
 unhone ramanandacharya or rambhadracharya ke hawaale se kaha ki unki maanas tikaa main bhi avadhpuri kaa zikr he, kisi khaas sthaan kaa nahin
 Jilani rejected the proof of the Doha century, saying that no evidence of its basilis was given
 skandapurana main ayodhya khand main ram janmasthan ko lekar chauhaddi or duuri kaa zikr he, lekin ab vah jagah nahin mil rahi jiskaa zikr puraana main he
 Justice Bobde said that there is no dispute about the birth of Ram in Ayodhya? Is it only about birthplace? Jilani said on this absolutely
 justise bobade ne poocha ki aap ram chabutare ko ram janmasthan maanate hai? to Jilani said yes, everyone has believed this before
 skandapurana kahata he ki janmasthan amuk-amuk sthaan se amuk duuri par he
 But now that place does not exist
 jilani ne kaha ki san 1886 main jila jaj ne bhi apane faisle main ram chabutara ko janmasthan maanate hue vahaan puja karne kii ijazat di thi
 The 1886 decision also stated that the platform is the birthplace
 par baad main hindu janmasthan mandir bataate hue aantarik ahaate or gumbad vaali imaarat par daawa karne lage
 Bobde asked - You believe that no one challenged this decision? Jilani said that we did not challenge
 par baad main bahut si rit daakhil huin
 But she was not challenging it but with authority
 jilani ne kaha ki hindu 1886 ke faisle main puja kaa adhikaar milane ke baad vahaan chabutare par hi mandir bananaa chaahate the
 But the then district court did not allow it
 gavaah satyanarayan treepathi ke bayaan kaa hawaale dete hue jilani ne kaha ki maanas main bhi sirf ayodhya kaa zikr he ram janmasthan kaa nahin
 a witness has mentioned the birth of Ram in Dasharatha's palace, but the position of the palace is not known
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki gavaahon ne shastron kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki seetakup ke agnikon main 200 kadam dur shri ram kaa janmasthan he
 Jilani told the map that the birthplace and the north-south of the Sita coup is also mentioned, but the birthplace was obeying the temple, and the platform
 phir hinduon ne apana vishwaas badal diya or donon jagahon par daawa karne lage
 Jilani said that a witness also stated that Kavitavali and other texts also mention Ram's birth in Ayodhya or Avadhpuri or Saket, but not the specific birthplace
 gavaah bhi vashishtha kunda, lomash kunda, vidhneshwar ganesh or pindarak se vivaadit sthal kii duuri or disha ke bare main kuch nahin bataa paae
 No specific place was also mentioned in Valmiki Ramayana
 ramcharita maanas kii rachana masjid banane ke kareeb 70 saal baad hui, lekin kahin yah zikr nahin he ki ram janm sthaan vahaan he jahaan masjid he
 That is, the belief of Hindus about the place of birth also changed later
 justise bobade ne poocha ki babar ne mandir todakar masjid banaai, pehle kabhi mandir tha us jagah masjid banaai yaa khaali jagah par masjid bani? is sawaal par jilani bole babar ne khaali plat par masjid banaai thi
 If the temple had been there before, Babur would not have known about it
 jilani ne kaha ki in-e-akabari main bhi ram janmabhumi kaa nahin lekin pavitra shahar avadh kaa zikr he, jahaan hindu ram kii puja karte hai
 Justice Bhushan interrupted Geelani that Skandpuran has also cited your witness in which he has spoken about Ram's birthplace
 jilani ne kaha ki skandapurana to 18 veen sadi main publish hua tha
 Justice Bhushan said that it is not about publishing but talk about the writing of Purana
 aapke gavaah ne hi chhathi sadi main likhe jane kii baat kehete hue kaha tha ki shaayad ye usase bhi pehle astitv main aayaa hoga
 Justice Chandrachud said that your plea is due to not mentioning birthplace? Jilani said that whether the mosque there is called Babri or not
 yah zyaada zaruri he ki us dhaanche main hindu puja nahin karte the
 Jilani said that where the mosque was built there was no temple, the temple was on the banks of Saryu
 unka bhi kahana he ki janmasthan mandir ramkot, yani kile main tha
 Justice Bobde asked that the mosque is not mentioned in ain-i-akbari? Jilani said that the claim of Hindus that a mosque was built by breaking the temple
 justise bobade ne poocha ramkot, kahaan he wo kila? jilani ne kaha ki vah to puure shahar ke chaaron ore bani diwaar thi
 But now he is the name of a locality
 kila to nakshe main hi he
 The fort is also written on the map
 is par court ne nakshaa dikhaate hue kaha ki nakshe main to ek chote se hisse ko durg bataaya gaya he
 Jilani said that there was a bungalow on the banks of the river
 use hi fortress kaha gaya hoga
 Some travelers, such as Treffen Theler, also mention Fortes, but that is more
 justise bobade ne kaha ki kya ram janmasthan kii akject koi lokation he? jilani ne kaha nahin
 Bobde then asked if Ram considers the platform the birthplace? Jilani said that yes, Hindus also believe the same
 iske baad sunwaayee buudhvaar tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai

 asina krishna pratipada se lekar amavasya tak shraadh kiye jate hai
 This year Shraddh has started from September 28
 bhartiya samskruti main shraadh ko ek vishesh darja diya gaya he
 What is Shraadh? Why Shradh? What is the need for Shradh? Consider these questions, then many useful things emerge
 aapako pataa hoga ki shraadh kaa taatpary shraddhabhivyakti parak karm hai, jo devatmaon, mahapurushon, rishiyon, gurujanon or pitar purushon kii prasannataa ke liye kiye jate hai
 The annual shraadh is also performed, in which an attempt is made to show devotion, reverential feelings of gratitude to the ancestors of ancestral men
 in sab prayatnon main pitaron kii tripti ke liye unki puja-upasna ke saath vaidic vidhaan se pindadaan ke saath unka tarpan kiya jaataa he
 Objects are just symbols, real devotion is reverence
 vahi pitar, dev, rishi va mahapurushon ko prasann karne ke madhyam banati he
 Every day, every moment to be performed, Shraddha is always the best
 baarah maheenon ke puure 365 din dev-pitaron ke prati shraddha vyakt kii jaae to or uttam he
 The higher the worship-worship, the better
 dev-pitradi ko jitani adhik shraddha bhaavana samarpit karke prasann kiya jaay, utana uttam
 The Shraddh of Pitripaksha is such that if the devotions do not become routine, then the moral should be done right
 asli shraddha to nity dev pujan, pitar pujan, rishi atmaaon kaa pujan or satswarup ishwar araadhan he
 The more this is done, the greater is the opportunity to get closer to the truth
 hamen is adhikadhik shraddha samarpan ke liye prayatnsheel hona chahie
 If reverence touches the truth, then it should be understood that Shraddha is blessed
 varsh main ek baar shraadh kiya to kya kiya? shraddharpan har vakt, har pal, har kshan hona chahie
 The greater the blessings of God, the man, the divine and the power of God, the more unfortunate we are
 shraadh ke saath-saath ek or baat bhi karne yogya he
 We wish God or fatherly men good luck
 sukh saubhaahgya keval ishwar se nahin milte
 He is also present in this elaborate nature composed by him, which is made of Panch Mahabhutas

 In this, not only grain water, tree vegetation also helps us to be alive and healthy
 shraadh ke saath-saath ped-paudhe bhi lagaaenvruksh vanaspatiyon se nikle oxigen se ham sabhi kii praan raksha or poshan hota he
 From this point of view, we also have a duty to prevent plantation of vegetation, so plantation should be done
 haalanki van pradeshon main rahane waalon ko shaayad isaki aavashyaktaa upyogita kam maaloom pade, parantu registan main jaakar dekhie vrikshon kaa kya mahatv he
 When the heat of the hot sand is dying out of unbearable heat, only then the importance of the lush green earth's green area is understood
 isiilie ped lagane kaa kram bhi shraadh ke saath-saath karte rahanaa chahie
 Just as Pitar is our foster nutrient, similarly trees are also our life guards
 unke bina kisi bhi prakaar sukh saubhaahgya kii sambhaavna nahin ban sakati
 On the occasion of Shraddha, we pay obeisance to the ancestors, god spirits and sage spirits on one side, and on the other hand, plant each plant in the earth's dock
 hariyaali rahegi, tabhi ham rahenge or satya ke nikat pahunchane vaali shraddhabhivyakti-shraadh karmon ko karne kaa suavasar hamen milegaa

 com / Is the race for modern development taking away our tradition, culture and old things? Is destroying rivers, messing with nature? After all, what is the meaning of this development and where will it end? Two journalists Abhay Mishra and Pankaj Ramendu's book dar-by-gange raises some similar serious and urgent questions
 yah kitaab us ganga kii khoj he, jo hamaare itihaas or puraanon main jeevandaayini he
 On the banks of which civilization and cultures have been flourishing for thousands of years
 jo jivan kaa mul aadhaar he, jo poojya he
 But in the race for modernity, this revered river is losing its life form
 pahaado kii god se nikalakar maidan main aate-aate uskaa swaroop hi badal jaataa he
 Shubhra, Kalima starts sieving in Dhaval Dhara
 vikaas kii mashinari se niklaa sara kachra ganga main jaakar gir rahaa he or kabhi har-har gange ke naam se khyath ganga dar-dar gange ho rahi he
 The biggest feature of this book is its style
 ganga main bad rahaa pradooshan koi nai or chaunkaane vaali khabar nahin he
 Much has been written about this
 isliye ganga pradooshan ke bare main koi bhi lekhan pehali najar main shushk patrakaariya lekhan hone kaa abhas detaa he
 But this is not the case with this book
 yah pustak ganga kii khoj main kii gari ek lambii yatra kaa vivaran he, isliye isamen yatra vrittant se lekar sansmaranon tak kii jhalkiyaan milti hai
 The author duo has started from the point of origin of the Ganges and has traveled to all the cities where the river passes through
 lekhakon ne kitaab main gangotri, uttarkashi, tehri, devprayag, rishikesh, gadhmukteshwar, narora, kanpur, elahabaad, vindhyachal, baxur, patna or kolkata se lekar gangasagar tak kaa safar tay kiya he
 Although the Ganges passes through many cities, but both authors have chosen thirty cities very carefully
 ye ve shahar hai, jahaan se guzarate hue ganga apana vaastavik swaroop khoti jaati he
 And the contaminated colors of civilization dissolve in it
 kitaab main in shaharon main nadi kii dasha ke saath-saath inke saamaajik-saanskrithik parivesh or yatra ke dauraan hui rochak ghatnaon kii kahaniyaan bhi hai
 Like any story, this travelogue has characters, stories, local folklore and legends
 lekhakon ne ganga ke kinare basii hui sabhyataaon ke itihaas kii padtaal karne kii bhi koshish kii he
 It is quite interesting to know how the living, culture and ways of worship of the cities and villages that have been living on the banks of the river are different from other places
 dar-dar gange ke bare main paryaavaranvid or gandhivadi kaaryakarta anupam mishra kehete hai, “dar dar gange puri ganga dikhaa detii he
 It also explains the depth of the Ganges and the shallowness of our modern development
 yah gangotri se gangasagar tak kii vichaar yatra kaa adbhut anand detii he
 Also a strange sadness
 udaasi isliye kyonki pathak is yatra kii samaapti ko man se sweekaar nahin kar paata
 "this book, written in a very simple language and interestingly, raises many serious questions
 jaise ki jis tehri main ganga kii sabase prabal dhara bahati he, vahaan pine kaa pani tankeron se kyon mangana padataa he
 The plains of which the Ganges gives such a beautiful appearance to the plains, why are those areas so full of cruelty and ruthlessness towards their beloved river
 vikaas kaa koi virdohi nahin he, lekin kya ham ek aise desh kii kalpana kar sakate hai, jahaan nadiyaan nahin hongi, jahaan ganga nahin hogi
 If not, what are we doing to save our rivers? pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara rajmarg kii aadharshila rakhane ke maukey par aaj mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ko ajeebogareeb sthiti kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The crowd present at the event shouted slogans against the Congress leader, prompting an angry Hooda to say that he would never share the stage with Modi from now on
 kendriya parivahan rajyamantri krishnapal gujjar or kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ke bhaashan ke baad jab hooda bhaashan dene aaen to bheed ne unke or congress sarkaar ke khilaaf naare lagaae
 Meanwhile, Hooda continued to read the pre-prepared speech in a hurry when Modi arrived there in a helicopter and appealed to keep calm while greeting the crowd
 baharhaal bheed ne is taraf dhyaan nahin diya or mukhyamantri ke bhaashan main baadha daalana jari rakhaa jise puri tarah nahin suna ja sakaa
 The police and other security agencies faced a lot of problems in controlling the crowd amid the hot and humid weather
 modi ne remote kaa batan dabaakar rajmarg pariyojna kii aadharshila rakhi, jiske baad jab unhone bhaashan shuru kiya to bheed ne media ke sthaan par kabja kar liya
 Apart from Hooda, Haryana PWD Minister Randeep Singh Surjewala was also present at the function
 haryana se party ke kai saansadon sahit bhaajapa ke kai netaa is avasar par maujuud rahe
 Birender Singh, who recently left the Congress and joined the BJP, was also present at the function
 diaron ne kaha, ‘‘prakriya haalanki, shuru ho chuki he lekin hamen nahin lagata he ki bainkon kii karj dene kii ichhashakti or companiyon kii karj lene kii bhukh main kisi prakaar kaa koi ullekhneey badlaav aayegaa

 a report in the media claimed that Pakistani intelligence agency ISI chief Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha was possibly aware of the attack on India's economic capital
 propublica
 In the US, American journalist Sebastian Rotella wrote, basically as American and Indian officials say Headley was more than a terrorist, he was a Pakistani spy
 report main bataaya gaya ki america or bhartiya agenciyon kii jaanch main pehali baar yah baat saamne ai he ki kaise paak khufia agency ne doharaa khelaa khelaa
 On the one hand, he was America's partner in the war on terror, while he was also involved in terrorist organizations that served Pakistani interests
 is website ke haath lage mumbai hamale kii jaanch se jude dastavejon se yah baat pukhta hui he ki paak kii khufia agency iesai ke adhikariyon ne mumbai hamalon main aatanki sanghathan lashkar kaa saath diya
 These attacks killed 166 people, including six Americans
 america patrkaar sebstian ne apni report main kaha he, bharat or america donon deshon ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki unhen is baat kaa vishwaas he ki hedli ko iesai ke adhikariyon ne jasusi kii training di or mumbai sahit anya jagahon par aatanki nishaanon ke bare main jaankaree lene ke liye dhan or hidaayaten di
 Referring to Headley's interrogation by Indian authorities, the media report said, Headley told investigators that a Pakistani Navy official assisted in planning a sea strike on Mumbai
 propublica kii report main hedli ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki paak khufia agency main uske hukmaranon ne denmark ke akhbaar par lashkar ke hamale kii sajeesh ke silsile main hui baithak main hissaa liya 
 Pak did not share this information with Danish authorities
 propublica ke anusaar, pakistani prashaskon ne in aaropon ko jahaan galat qaraar diya he vahiin america jaanchakartaaon ko hedli ke adhikansh bayaan main sachaai najar aa rahi he
 In a very important revelation, this report claimed that Headley said that the ISI chief should take over
 general pasha 26 / 11 hamale ke baad giraftaar kiye gayi lashkar pramukh jackiur rahamaan lakhvi se milane gaye
 Without any elaborate discussion, Headley said, Pasha came to him to understand the plot of Mumbai terror attack
 media main ai is report main kaha gaya he, paak adhikari is baat se inkaar karte hai ki iesai pramukh jail main lakhvi se milane gaye lekin bhartiya or america adhikariyon or visheshgyon ko duusari vaali kahani par bharosa he
 "I believe that Pasha was already aware of the conspiracy for the Mumbai attack or he is not the head of the ISI," the report quoted an Indian counter-terrorism official as saying
 propublica kii report main haalanki kaha gaya he ki america adhikari is baat ke subut nahin dekhte ki mumbai par hamale ke liye iesai ke hukmaranon ne sansthagat faisla liya
 The report said that some officials felt that Headley's sometimes subtle and sometimes questionable statements were meant to absolve the ISI top officials

 According to research, it has been found that people of Bastar treat jaundice disease affecting liver, the major organ of the body, with ant (chapra) found there
 darasal in chintiyon main farmik acid hota he
 When ants sting patients suffering from jaundice, the bilirubin present in them is converted into bilubardine by chemical action
 isse pilia marij ke sharir main peelaapan kuch kam najar aata he
 Madhavi Tiwari, a research scholar at Bastar University, is doing research with the people of Bastar to test the recognition of treating jaundice with chapra ant
 chapada cheentee kaa vaigyanik naam ekophila smarg dina he
 Bastar residents use not only jaundice, but also chapada chutney for stomach ailments
 darasal raktaras main pittaranjak (billrubin) naamak rang hota he, jisaki maatra badhane se twachaa or shleshmik kala main pilaa rang aa jaataa he
 The level of bilarubin is usually one percent or less in Raktras but when its quantity is 2
 5 pratishat ke upar ho jaati he
 This condition is called jaundice
 madhavi tiwari kahana he ki adivasee pilia kaa ilaaj karne ke liye chapada naamak chintiyon ko peedit marij ke sharir par chhodte hai
 Studies have shown that the color of the pingnation that forms in the body due to the sting of the chapra changes, causing the yellowing of the body to appear
 madhavi ne bastar ke bademurmaa, golapalli or karanji main sarpanchon kii madd se pilia peediton par iskaa prayog kiya he
 Chapada chutney (red ants) is especially considered to be tasty and medicinal with the food of the tribals of Bastar
 gaavan main chapada kii chatnee itani pasand kii jaati he ki bastar ke haat-bazaaron main bhi ise bechaa jaataa he
 Villagers believe that consumption of this chapada chutney also cures malaria, dengue and fever
 gaanvvasi jangal jaakar ped ke neeche, gamchaa, kapadaa yaa kuch bichhaakar ped kii shakhaon ko hilaate hai, jisase chapada neeche girte hai or unhen ikattha kar bazaar main bechaa jaataa he yaa chatnee banaakar istemaal kiya jaataa he

 aajkal aap offis of profit kaa vivaad khub sunate honge
 It is reported that the Election Commission has invited 21 Aam Aadmi Party mlas to present their case on 14 July
 agar chunaav ayog ne inhen doshi paaya to inaki sadsyta ja sakati he
 The case remains Aam Aadmi Party vs Bharatiya Janata Party vs Congress Party in Delhi
 chunaav ayog kii report ke baad is par bharat ke raashtrapati faisla lenge
 The President does not consult the Union Council of Ministers in this matter
 is maamle main chunaav ayog hi apni report bhej saktaa he
 According to all interpretations of the Constitution, there is no legal role of the Central Government or the Council of Ministers in the matter of office of profit
 aam aadmi party ne ek kanoon banaakar raashtrapati ko bheja tha lekin raashtrapati ne manzuri nahin di
 Now this matter is hanging like a sword over the Delhi government
 is vivaad ke zariye hamaare aapke liye phir se samajhane kaa mauka he ki samvidhan main nirvaachit pratinidhi kii kis tarah se kalpana kii gai he taaki vah sarkaar se swatantra rahe or apane kshetra kii janata ke prati zimmedaar rahe
 We and you always look at any MP or MLA as a representative of the ruling party or opposition
 lekin loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha apane sadasyon ko sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par nahin dekhati he
 The imagination of the House is based on whether the MLA or MP is the voice of the public within it
 sadan main jo sadsy mantri hai sirf unhen hi sarkaar kii awaz yaa pratinidhi mana jaataa he
 The Constitution has envisaged that mlas or mps should not come under any influence of the government
 iske liye zaruri he ki wo aisa pad sweekaar na kare jahaan se use vetan aadi kii suvidha mili, jisase usase satta main hissedaar hone kaa mauka mili or jo sarkaar ke sidhe sangrakshan main aa jaae jis par sarkaar kaa bas chale
 This has been done so that the MLA or MP represents only the public in the House
 sarkaar ke paas anek pad hote hai
 She can seat her mps in every post, give them to mlas
 agar aisa hua to sadan main sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv bad jayega or sadan main janata kaa pratinidhitiv ghat jayega
 Keep in mind that only members of the House are ministers who have a certain number
 magar saare sadsy mantri yaa chairman na ho jaaen iske liye hi offis of profit kii kalpana kii gai he taaki unki sadsyta radd kii ja sake
 The constitution makers believed that if the MLA or MP came under the influence or protection of the government, they would not be able to remain independent
 sadan ke bheetar sadsy ko bina kisi ke prabhaav main aana chahie
 This is the ideal system
 vyaavhaarik vyavastha kuch or he
 Our elected representatives have made a history of losing membership on the charge of asking questions about money
 dal kaa naam lene se koi laabh nahin
 You are seeing how the mlas are moving their vote from here and there under the influence of money in Rajya Sabha elections
 kuch log chunaav main party kii seva kar dete hai phir ve rajya sabha se lekar vidhaan parishad main aa jate hai
 First give some of his profit to the party and then take office from the government of that party
 aise sadsy ko aap pad de yaa na den, kya kisi bhi tarah se aap offis of profit kii naitikta se mukt rakh sakate hai
 Many parties have sent such members to the House who are also influencing the government without taking office of profit and are also influencing the policy making within the House
 21 agast, 1954 ko loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar sahab ne rajya sabha ke chairman se mashwara kar offis of profit ke liye ek cameti banaai
 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava due to which it is known as Bhargava Committee
 bhargav sahab hisar ke saansad the
 The committee suggested that by bringing a comprehensive bill, it should be clarified which post is a post of profit and which is not a post of profit
 dhyaan rahe yah kaam sarkaar nahin karti he balki sansad kii sanyukt samiti karti he
 Since then, a joint committee is formed during every Lok Sabha and the post of profit is defined
 jo sadsy laabh ke pad ko sweekaar karte hai unki sadsyta chali jaati he
 The government also orders the public sector undertaking not to pay any kind of salary if an MP is a member of their committee
 sansad yaa vidhansabha ke sadasyon kii swatantraaa kii kitni kuubasurat kalpana kii gai he
 Deliberately imagined because what has been said, has it come true or is it happening? Like, before a vote on a bill, a collective decision is taken in a meeting of the parliamentary party in the House premises
 saansad yaa vidhayak party line se alag nahin bolte
 Whip is imposed so that members go with the collective decision
 isliye offis of profit kii mul bhaavana kahaan tak lagu he ise aap samaj bhi lenge to kuch nahin kar paaenge
 The political system does not change with your understanding
 raajnneeti aapako hi badal detii he
 It is important that we understand the definition of office and profit
 offis wo sarkari vibhaag he jiske zariye aap samaaj ke liye kaam karte hai
 In return, he gets salary and other allowances
 yatra bhatta yaa yaa kuch kharch isamen shaamil nahin he
 Transaction of money is at its center
 har pad offis of profit ke daayre main nahin aata he
 We have to understand to what extent a government exercises its influence on its mlas or mps
 pi di tii acharya kii sampadit kitaab ke anusaar supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test nirdhaarit kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 phir test hota he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The biggest test is whether the government appoints
 yah dekha jayega ki sarkaar vidhayak ke bos kii tarah kaam to nahin karti yani use us pad se barkhaast kar sakati he, hataa sakati he or kaam par niyantran rakh sakati he
 Does the government pay him monetary wages etc
 isse sabit hota he ki sarkari offis hota he yaa nahin
 This is followed by a test of profit
 pandicherry ke meyar ke pad par vidhayak kii niyukti hui
 The Election Commission considered Office of Profit as many allowances
 magar ise nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata he
 Therefore, there does not appear to be a single explanation for this
 ab aate hai aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke maamle par
 Later, the Delhi Legislative Assembly also passed a bill stipulating that their membership of the Chief Minister and Ministers would not be taken on assuming the post of Parliamentary Secretary, as these are not posts of profit
 vidhansabha ne ise paas kar diya magar raashtrapati ne manzuri nahin di
 This is also an issue
 kya raashtrapati ne antim rup se lautaa diya yaa abhi bhi unki shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kar up rajyapal dobaaraa bhej sakate hai
 a similar case took place in 2006 as well
 tab dilli main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad diye the
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of trans-yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman, Rural Development Board, etc
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne in 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought out a bill to save her government and excluded 14 offices from the list of Office of Profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he, ham sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Similar bills have been passed in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand
 raashtrapati kalam ne 31 may 2006 ko shila kaa yah bill waapas kar diya tha
 Sheila Dixit sent again and the President approved
 tab centre or dilli main ek hi party kii sarkaar thi
 Now the situation is different
 aam aadmi party to congress samskruti ke kilaaf nai raajnneeti karne ai thi
 Why did so many legislators need to be made parliamentary secretaries or did the work that Sheila Dixit had done
 bijepi ne tab bhi virodh kiya tha ab bhi virodh kar rahi he
 MP Meenakshi Lekhi had said in a press conference that Delhi has a special constitutional system
 ye rajya nahin, ek shahar he
 This city can have only 7 ministers and 21 secretaries are appointed on top of 7
 21 emele kii jo niyukti hui he, wo gaiyr-kanoonee he
 There is no system of law in this
 sansadeey sachiv karypalika kaa hissaa he
 You can control that mechanism
 isliye yah laabh kaa pad hota he
 Even if you are not taking any salary
 tippaniyan Why parliamentary secretaries are appointed, because the number of law ministers can be only 15 percent of the number of members of the Legislative Assembly
 dilli main ye 10 fisadi he
 This has been done so that the number of ministers does not increase and the government is not burdened
 lekin aap dekhte hai ki tamaam rajyon main rajya mantri kaa darja baant diya jaataa he
 The MLA keeps flashing in the area with a car, guard
 kai logon ko sachiv vagairah bana diya jaataa he
 Haryana has 13 ministers but there are 4 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries
 rajasthan main bhi 5 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Gujarat also has 5 Parliamentary Secretaries
 pichhali sarkaar main mamata banerjee ne 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 She also brought legislation for this, but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kalakatta hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke us kanoon ko asanvaidhanik bataakar khaarij kar diya or 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di
 But his membership did not go away
 jabaki ye vidhayak sansadeey sachiv rah chuke the
 In 2006, the Chhattisgarh government brought out the Prevention of Disqualification Amendment Bill and removed 90 posts from the Office of Profit
 ab dilli main hangaamaa hua to chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ne maang shuru kar di he ki jin 11 sansadeey sachivon ko hataaya jaae jise bijepi sarkaar ne niyukt kiye hai
 The Congress is accusing the BJP of having double standards, while its government in Delhi has done so in 2006
 ham or aap jab bhi kisi saansad yaa vidhayak ko dekhte hai to hameshaa use satta paksh yaa vipaksh ke pratinidhi ke rup main dekhte hai
 But the Lok Sabha or the Legislative Assembly does not view its members as representatives of the government
 sadan kii kalpana is par aadhaarit he ki vidhayak yaa saansad uske bheetar janata kii awaz hai
 Only members who are ministers in the house are considered to be the voice or representative of the government
 samvidhan ne aisi kalpana kii he ki vidhayak yaa saansad sarkaar ke kisi bhi prakaar ke prabhaav main na aae
 For this, it is necessary that he should not accept such a post from where he will get the facility of salary, etc
, which gives him a chance to share in power and which comes under the direct patronage of the government on which the government should settle
 aisa isliye kiya gaya he ki sadan main vidhayak yaa saansad sirf janata kii numaaindgi karen
 The government has many positions
 wo har pad main apane saansadon ko bitha sakati he, vidhayakon ko de sakati he
 If this happens, the government's representation in the House will increase and the people's representation in the House will decrease
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa ki sadan ke hi sadsy mantri hote hai jinaki kuch nishchit sankhya hoti he
 But for all the members not to be ministers or chairman, it is only the office of profit has been conceived so that their membership can be canceled
 samvidhan nirmaataa samajhate the ki agar vidhayak yaa saansad sarkaar ke prabhaav yaa sangrakshan main aa gaya to wo swatantra nahin rah paaegaa
 The member should come under the influence of no one within the House
 ye adarsh vyavastha he
 Practical arrangement is something else
 paise lekar sawaal poochne ke aarope main hamaare nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ne sadsyta ganvaane kaa itihaas banaaya he
 There is no benefit from taking the name of the party
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki rajya sabha ke chunaav main vidhayak kis tarah se dhan ke prabhaav main apana vot idhar se udhar kar rahe hai
 Some people serve the party in elections, then they come from Rajya Sabha to the Legislative Council
 pehle party ko apane profit main se kuch dete hai phir us party kii sarkaar se offis le lete hai
 Do you give or not to such a member, can you in any way keep yourself free from the morality of the office of profit
 kai dalon ne aise sadasyon ko sadan main bheja he jo bina offis of profit liye sarkaar ko bhi prabhavit kar rahe hai or sadan ke bheetar niti nirmaan par bhi asar daal rahe hai
 On 21 August 1954, GV Mavalankar Saheb, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, consulted the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and formed a committee for the Office of Profit
 is cameti ke adhyaksh the pandit thakur das bhargav jinke kaaran ise bhargav cameti ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Bhargava Saheb was the MP of Hisar
 cameti ne suzav diya ki ek vyapak bill laakar saaf kiya jaae ki koun sa pad laabh kaa pad he or koun sa laabh kaa pad nahin he
 Keep in mind that this work is not done by the government, but the Joint Committee of Parliament
 tab se lekar har loksabhaa ke dauraan sanyukt cameti banati he or laabh ke pad ko paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Members who accept the post of profit lose their membership
 sarkaar saarvajanik upkram ko aadesh bhi detii he ki agar koi saansad unki cameti kaa sadsy he to use kisi bhi prakaar kaa vetan na diya jaae
 How beautiful the freedom of the Members of Parliament or Assembly has been imagined
 jaanboojh kar kalpana kaha kyonki jo kaha he gaya kya wo aksharsh: saakaar hua he yaa ho rahaa he? jaise kisi vidheyak par matdaan se pehle sadan parisar main hi sansadeey dal kii baithak main samuhik faisla le liya jaataa he
 mps or mlas do not speak apart from the party line
 sadsy samuhik faisle ke saath jaaen isliye wheep laga diya jaataa he
 Therefore, even if you understand how far the basic spirit of Office is applicable, you will not be able to do anything
 raajnneetik vyavastha aapke samaj jane se nahin badalati he
 Politics changes you
 zaruri he ki ham offis or profit kii paribhaasha ko samajhen
 Office is the government department through which you work for the society
 uske badale vetan or anya bhatte milte hai
 Travel allowance or or some expenses are not included
 paise kaa len-dein hona iske centre main he
 Not every post comes under the purview of Office of Profit
 hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki koi sarkaar apane vidhayakon yaa saansadon ko pad dekar us par kis had tak apana prabhaav kaayam karti he
 According to the edited book by PDT Acharya, the Supreme Court has prescribed certain tests to determine the office of profit
 pehle test hota he ki offis he yaa nahin
 Then there is a test whether the profit has been made or not
 sabase bada test is baat ko lekar hota he ki kya sarkaar niyukti karti he
 It will be seen that the government does not act like the boss of the legislator, that is, he can dismiss, remove and control the work from that post
 kya sarkaar use vetan aadi maudrik bhugtan karti he
 This proves that there is a government office or not
 iske baad profit kaa test hota he
 The MLA was appointed to the post of Mayor of Pondicherry
 chunaav ayog ne offis of profit mana kyonki kai tarah ke bhatte milte the
 But this was not accepted as the post of mayor does not come under the control of the government
 isliye isaki koi ek vyakhya nahin dikhti he
 Now come on the matter of making 21 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party as Parliamentary Secretaries
 baad main dilli vidhansabha ne ek vidheyak bhi paas kar vyavastha di ki mukhyamantri or mantriyon ke sansadeey sachiv kaa pad grahan karne par unki sadsyta nahin jaaegi, kyonki ye laabh ke pad nahin hai
 The Assembly passed it but the President did not approve
 yah bhi ek masalaa he
 Can the President finally return or can he still address his doubts and send the Lt
 Governor again
 2006 main bhi aisa ek maamla hua tha
 At that time, Sheila Dikshit gave various types of posts to the 19 Congress mlas in Delhi
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans-yamuna Area Development Board ke chairman,vaais chairman, gramin vikaas board vagairah
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent a notice of office of profit to these 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek bill le ain or 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit kii list se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government, we are constitutionally doing so
 aise hi bill chhattisgarh or jharkhand main paas kiye gaye hai
 Sheila's bill was returned by President Kalam on 31 May 2006
 shila dikshit ne dobaaraa bheja or raashtrapati ne manzuri de di
 Then there was a single party government at the Center and Delhi
 ab sthiti alag he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had come to do new politics against the Congress culture
 itane vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane kii kya zarurat tha yaa wo kaam kyon kiya jo shila dikshit kar chuki thim
 BJP had protested even then, is still protesting
 saansad minakshi lekhi ne press conference kar kaha tha ki dilli kii vishesh sanvaidhanik vyavastha he
 This is a city, not a state
 is shahar main keval 7 mantri ho sakate hai or 7 ke upar 21 sachiv lagaaye jate hai
 The appointment of 21 mlas is illegal
 kanoon main isaki koi vyavastha hi nahin he
 The Parliamentary Secretary is part of the executive
 aap us tantra ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 Therefore, it is a term of profit
 bhale aap koi selary na le rahe hon
 The comments sansadeey sachiv kyon banaae jate hai, kyonki kanoon mantriyon kii sankhya vidhaan sabha ke sadasyon kii sankhya kaa 15 fisadi hi ho saktaa he
 It is 10% in Delhi
 ye isliye kiya gaya he ki mantriyon kii sankhya adhik na ho jaae or sarkaar par boj na pade
 But you see that the status of Minister of State is distributed among all the states
 gaadi, guard lekar vidhayak ji kshetra main flash karte rahete hai
 Many people are made secretaries and so on
 haryana main 13 mantri hai magar vahaan 4 mukhya sansadeey sachiv hai
 In Rajasthan also 5 mlas have been made Parliamentary Secretaries
 gujarat main bhi 5 sansadeey sachiv hai
 In the previous government, Mamata Banerjee made 24 legislators as parliamentary secretaries
 ve iske liye kanoon bhi lekar ain, lekin 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar hui
 The Calcutta High Court rejected Mamata Banerjee's law as unconstitutional and canceled the appointment of 24 mlas
 lekin unki sadsyta nahin gai
 While these mlas had been parliamentary secretaries
 2006 main chhattisgarh sarkaar ne privansion of disqualification amendament bill laakar 90 padon ko offis of profit se baahar kar diya
 Now there is a ruckus in Delhi and Ajit Jogi in Chhattisgarh has started demanding that 11 parliamentary secretaries be removed by the BJP government
 congress ise lekar bijepi par dohare maandand kaa aarope laga rahi he jabaki 2006 main dilli main hi uski sarkaar aisa kar chuki he
 This is the ideal system
 vyaavhaarik vyavastha kuch or he
 Our elected representatives have made a history of losing membership on the charge of asking questions about money
 dal kaa naam lene se koi laabh nahin
 You are seeing how the mlas are moving their vote from here and there under the influence of money in Rajya Sabha elections
 kuch log chunaav main party kii seva kar dete hai phir ve rajya sabha se lekar vidhaan parishad main aa jate hai
 First give some of his profit to the party and then take office from the government of that party
 aise sadsy ko aap pad de yaa na den, kya kisi bhi tarah se aap offis of profit kii naitikta se mukt rakh sakate hai
 Many parties have sent such members to the House who are also influencing the government without taking office of profit and are also influencing the policy making within the House
 21 agast, 1954 ko loksabhaa ke pehle spikar ji ve maavlankar sahab ne rajya sabha ke chairman se mashwara kar offis of profit ke liye ek cameti banaai
 The chairman of this committee was Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava due to which it is known as Bhargava Committee
 bhargav sahab hisar ke saansad the
 The committee suggested that by bringing a comprehensive bill, it should be clarified which post is a post of profit and which is not a post of profit
 dhyaan rahe yah kaam sarkaar nahin karti he balki sansad kii sanyukt samiti karti he
 Since then, a joint committee is formed during every Lok Sabha and the post of profit is defined
 jo sadsy laabh ke pad ko sweekaar karte hai unki sadsyta chali jaati he
 The government also orders the public sector undertaking not to pay any kind of salary if an MP is a member of their committee
 sansad yaa vidhansabha ke sadasyon kii swatantraaa kii kitni kuubasurat kalpana kii gai he
 Deliberately imagined because what has been said, has it come true or is it happening? Like, before a vote on a bill, a collective decision is taken in a meeting of the parliamentary party in the House premises
 saansad yaa vidhayak party line se alag nahin bolte
 Whip is imposed so that members go with the collective decision
 isliye offis of profit kii mul bhaavana kahaan tak lagu he ise aap samaj bhi lenge to kuch nahin kar paaenge
 The political system does not change with your understanding
 raajnneeti aapako hi badal detii he
 It is important that we understand the definition of office and profit
 offis wo sarkari vibhaag he jiske zariye aap samaaj ke liye kaam karte hai
 In return, he gets salary and other allowances
 yatra bhatta yaa yaa kuch kharch isamen shaamil nahin he
 Transaction of money is at its center
 har pad offis of profit ke daayre main nahin aata he
 We have to understand to what extent a government exercises its influence on its mlas or mps
 pi di tii acharya kii sampadit kitaab ke anusaar supreme court ne offis of profit nirdhaarit karne ke liye kuch test nirdhaarit kiye hai
 The first test is whether the office is there or not
 phir test hota he ki profit hua yaa nahin
 The biggest test is whether the government appoints
 yah dekha jayega ki sarkaar vidhayak ke bos kii tarah kaam to nahin karti yani use us pad se barkhaast kar sakati he, hataa sakati he or kaam par niyantran rakh sakati he
 Does the government pay him monetary wages etc
 isse sabit hota he ki sarkari offis hota he yaa nahin
 This is followed by a test of profit
 pandicherry ke meyar ke pad par vidhayak kii niyukti hui
 The Election Commission considered Office of Profit as many allowances
 magar ise nahin mana gaya kyonki meyar kaa pad sarkaar ke niyantran main nahin aata he
 Therefore, there does not appear to be a single explanation for this
 ab aate hai aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane ke maamle par
 Later, the Delhi Legislative Assembly also passed a bill stipulating that their membership of the Chief Minister and Ministers would not be taken on assuming the post of Parliamentary Secretary, as these are not posts of profit
 vidhansabha ne ise paas kar diya magar raashtrapati ne manzuri nahin di
 This is also an issue
 kya raashtrapati ne antim rup se lautaa diya yaa abhi bhi unki shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kar up rajyapal dobaaraa bhej sakate hai
 a similar case took place in 2006 as well
 tab dilli main shila dikshit ne congress ke 19 vidhayakon ko kai prakaar ke pad diye the
 From Parliamentary Secretary to Chairman of trans-yamuna Area Development Board, Vice Chairman, Rural Development Board, etc
 niyukti ke baad chunaav ayog ne in 19 vidhayakon ko offis of profit kaa notice bhej diya
 Sheila Dixit brought out a bill to save her government and excluded 14 offices from the list of Office of Profit
 shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki meri sarkaar bachaana meraa haq he, ham sanvaidhanik taur par aisa kar rahe hai
 Similar bills have been passed in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand
 raashtrapati kalam ne 31 may 2006 ko shila kaa yah bill waapas kar diya tha
 Sheila Dixit sent again and the President approved
 tab centre or dilli main ek hi party kii sarkaar thi
 Now the situation is different
 aam aadmi party to congress samskruti ke kilaaf nai raajnneeti karne ai thi
 Why did so many legislators need to be made parliamentary secretaries or did the work that Sheila Dixit had done
 bijepi ne tab bhi virodh kiya tha ab bhi virodh kar rahi he
 MP Meenakshi Lekhi had said in a press conference that Delhi has a special constitutional system
 ye rajya nahin, ek shahar he
 This city can have only 7 ministers and 21 secretaries are appointed on top of 7
 21 emele kii jo niyukti hui he, wo gaiyr-kanoonee he
 There is no system of law in this
 sansadeey sachiv karypalika kaa hissaa he
 You can control that mechanism
 isliye yah laabh kaa pad hota he
 Even if you are not taking any salary
 tippaniyan Why parliamentary secretaries are appointed, because the number of law ministers can be only 15 percent of the number of members of the Legislative Assembly
 dilli main ye 10 fisadi he
 This has been done so that the number of ministers does not increase and the government is not burdened
 lekin aap dekhte hai ki tamaam rajyon main rajya mantri kaa darja baant diya jaataa he
 The MLA keeps flashing in the area with a car, guard
 kai logon ko sachiv vagairah bana diya jaataa he
 Haryana has 13 ministers but there are 4 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries
 rajasthan main bhi 5 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Gujarat also has 5 Parliamentary Secretaries
 pichhali sarkaar main mamata banerjee ne 24 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya tha
 She also brought legislation for this, but in 2013 a PIL was filed
 kalakatta hoicourt ne mamata banerjee ke us kanoon ko asanvaidhanik bataakar khaarij kar diya or 24 vidhayakon kii niyukti radd kar di
 But his membership did not go away
 jabaki ye vidhayak sansadeey sachiv rah chuke the
 In 2006, the Chhattisgarh government brought out the Prevention of Disqualification Amendment Bill and removed 90 posts from the Office of Profit
 ab dilli main hangaamaa hua to chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ne maang shuru kar di he ki jin 11 sansadeey sachivon ko hataaya jaae jise bijepi sarkaar ne niyukt kiye hai
 The Congress is accusing the BJP of having double standards, while its government in Delhi has done so in 2006

 zaruri he ki ham offis or profit kii paribhaasha ko samajhen
 Office is the government department through which you work for the society
 uske badale vetan or anya bhatte milte hai
 Travel allowance or or some expenses are not included

 At that time, Sheila Dikshit gave various types of posts to the 19 Congress mlas in Delhi
 sansadeey sachiv se lekar trans-yamuna Area Development Board ke chairman,vaais chairman, gramin vikaas board vagairah
 After the appointment, the Election Commission sent a notice of office of profit to these 19 mlas
 shila dikshit apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye ek bill le ain or 14 karyaalayon ko offis of profit kii list se baahar kar diya
 Sheila Dixit had said that it is my right to save my government, we are constitutionally doing so
 aise hi bill chhattisgarh or jharkhand main paas kiye gaye hai
 Sheila's bill was returned by President Kalam on 31 May 2006
 shila dikshit ne dobaaraa bheja or raashtrapati ne manzuri de di
 Then there was a single party government at the Center and Delhi
 ab sthiti alag he
 The Aam Aadmi Party had come to do new politics against the Congress culture
 itane vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv banane kii kya zarurat tha yaa wo kaam kyon kiya jo shila dikshit kar chuki thim
 BJP had protested even then, is still protesting
 saansad minakshi lekhi ne press conference kar kaha tha ki dilli kii vishesh sanvaidhanik vyavastha he
 This is a city, not a state
 is shahar main keval 7 mantri ho sakate hai or 7 ke upar 21 sachiv lagaaye jate hai
 The appointment of 21 mlas is illegal
 kanoon main isaki koi vyavastha hi nahin he
 The Parliamentary Secretary is part of the executive
 aap us tantra ko niyantrit kar sakate hai
 Therefore, it is a term of profit
 bhale aap koi selary na le rahe hon
 The comments sansadeey sachiv kyon banaae jate hai, kyonki kanoon mantriyon kii sankhya vidhaan sabha ke sadasyon kii sankhya kaa 15 fisadi hi ho saktaa he
 It is 10% in Delhi
 ye isliye kiya gaya he ki mantriyon kii sankhya adhik na ho jaae or sarkaar par boj na pade
 But you see that the status of Minister of State is distributed among all the states
 gaadi, guard lekar vidhayak ji kshetra main flash karte rahete hai
 Many people are made secretaries and so on
 haryana main 13 mantri hai magar vahaan 4 mukhya sansadeey sachiv hai
 In Rajasthan also 5 mlas have been made Parliamentary Secretaries
 gujarat main bhi 5 sansadeey sachiv hai
 In the previous government, Mamata Banerjee made 24 legislators as parliamentary secretaries
 ve iske liye kanoon bhi lekar ain, lekin 2013 main ek janhit yachika daayar hui
 The Calcutta High Court rejected Mamata Banerjee's law as unconstitutional and canceled the appointment of 24 mlas
 lekin unki sadsyta nahin gai
 While these mlas had been parliamentary secretaries
 2006 main chhattisgarh sarkaar ne privansion of disqualification amendament bill laakar 90 padon ko offis of profit se baahar kar diya

 congress ise lekar bijepi par dohare maandand kaa aarope laga rahi he jabaki 2006 main dilli main hi uski sarkaar aisa kar chuki he
 Why parliamentary secretaries are appointed, because the number of law ministers can be only 15 percent of the number of members of the Legislative Assembly
 dilli main ye 10 fisadi he
 This has been done so that the number of ministers does not increase and the government is not burdened
 lekin aap dekhte hai ki tamaam rajyon main rajya mantri kaa darja baant diya jaataa he
 The MLA keeps flashing in the area with a car, guard

 Haryana has 13 ministers but there are 4 Chief Parliamentary Secretaries

 In this video uploaded to youtube by Film Companion, Arjun also laughed off the 'stinging' comments he made about his obesity, his education and acting ability, and gave an accurate, befitting reply to each one

 ' Ashok Tanwarudda, who was the state president of the party for the last 6 years, will be the leader of the CLP along with the Election Committee President, Haryana elections are on the head, but the way the Congress veterans were heard in the state, the same message was going out that The bet is coming out of the party's hand
 haryana main bijepi kaa vishwaas isi se jhalkata rahaa he ki wo abaki baar 75 paar kaa udghosh lagaati rahi he
 That is, BJP is talking about winning more than 75 seats in 90 members
 vahiin congress se khemon main banty or bikhri hone jaisi khabaren hi baahar aati raheen
 In such a situation, the arrival of former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda in the lead role and the leave of Ashok Tanwar from the post of President of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee, it is clear that the team is run by Sonia Gandhi
 yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin ki ashok tanvar rahul gandhi kii pasand hai
 Despite all the tussle, he remained the state president of the party for the last 6 years and Ashok Tanwar himself had told everyone that he would go nowhere and the party would fight elections under his leadership, but politics did not take any time
 
 darasal, bhupendra singh hooda ko tanvar ke tewaron ke saath patari bithaane main hameshaa dikkat mahasoos hoti rahi
 He also lamented that his seniority was not being given much consideration and Ashok Tanwar used to report to Rahul Gandhi
 ho saktaa he isse hooda ke sammaan ko thes pahunchi ho or tabhi se unki tanvar se than gai
 The tussle between Hooda and Tanwar caught up before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 tab congress kii devaria se dilli vikaas yatra main hooda or tanvar samarthakon ke bich aapas main jamkar hathapayee ho gai thi
 Then Tanwar was also hurt
 unhone bhupendra hooda ke khilaaf maamla bhi darj karavaaya
 At that time, Rahul Gandhi supported Tanwar
 rahul kaa aashirwad hi tha ki hooda ke virodh ke baavjood bhi tanvar lagaataar pradesh party adhyaksh pad par tike rahe
 But now Sonia Gandhi is the Congress Working President and her close aide Ahmed Patel has a good relationship with Hooda
 yahi nahin haryana ke incharge gulam nabi aaazaad bhi lagaataar alaakaman ko yahi samajhaate aae ki bijepi ke saamne bhupendra singh hooda ke alaava kisi kaa sikaa nahin chal paaegaa
 Hooda held his Parivartan rally in Rohtak on 18 August to pressure the party
 vahaan ishaaron-ishaaron main party ko ultimatum bhi de diya
 In such a situation, senior Congress leaders explained to Hooda that Hooda should repose his faith in the party and withdraw from the ultimatum
 mangalvaar ko unke dwaara banaai gai cameti ne khanaapurti ke liye unako adhikrut kar diya faisla lene ke liye phir thik ek din baad buudhvaar ko gulam nabi aaazaad ne congress daftar main pahunchakar bina ashok tanvar kaa naam liye shailaja kumari ko haryana congress pradesh adhyaksh ghoshit kar diya
 Bhupendra Singh Hooda's first condition was to remove Ashok Tanwar and demand to make another leader the president
 vahiin randeep surajevaala lagaataar ashok tanvar ko back kar rahe the
 Finally Bhupendra Hooda agreed, he had agreed in the name of Shailaja Kumari
 shailaja ke liye unka dalit mahila card kaam aayaa
 His support was overshadowed by the support of Ahmed Patel and Azad
 bhupendra hooda ke liye tripal khushkhabari unki teenon hi maang manjuur kar lee gai
 Hooda got two positions
 haryana chunaav samiti kaa adhyaksh ghoshit kar diya or saath hi wo sielpi ke netaa bhi honge yani kii tikat vitaran main ahm bhoomika or prishtabhumi ke anusaar siem ummidavaar bhi ab vahi honge
 Also, this is the first major change in which the impression of Sonia has been seen and in such a situation, there is a lot of speculation that the rest will fall on Rahul's representatives or that Haryana's change was a compulsion and Sonia Gandhi will walk the balance
 aaj haratalika teej he
 Suhaginis observe this fast for the long life of their suhaag
 ye vrath bada hi kathin niyamon vaala vrath hota he
 Most of the women keep this fast waterless
 is din suhaaginen kathor tap or pujan se bhagwaan shiv ko prasann karke amar suhaag kaa vardaan maangati hai
 In fact, Maa Parvati had also attained Mahadev as a husband after performing rigorous penance
 isliye teej par maa parvati or mahadev kii ek saath puja kii jaati he
 But do you know that what is offered to Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati on the day of Haritalika Teej is definitely a boon of good luck
 agar nahin to ham yahaan aapako bataa rahe hai
 According to Jyotishacharya Shailendra Pandey, it is important to offer different offerings to women of different zodiac days on Teej
 isse unhen manachaaha vardaan milegaa
 Know what according to the zodiac, you get the blessings of unbroken good fortune by offering it to Shiva and Parvati

 In this case, the crooks who came in white colored Swift cars escaped
 mritak saajan ke pita kaa kahana he ki unke bhai ke ladakon ne hi is vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 Behind this is a week-long feud and old rivalry with the autos and vehicles running in the area

 chhindwara ke espi manoj raay ne kaha 'parijanon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki mritak sharaab pine kaa aadi tha or sharaab ke nashe main kaaphi rahata tha
 Probably this suicide seems to be the first sight of him
 hamen koi suicide note nahin mila he

 This time Shashank has made a Dhadak film with new artist Ishaan Khattar and actress Sridevi's daughter Jahnavi Kapoor
 haalanki yah film blockbster marathi film sarat kii oficial hindi rimek he 
 The Sairat film was also remade in Kannada and Punjabi in 2017 and its Hindi adaptation has been released this year
 kahani :film kii kahani udaipur se shuru hoti he jahaan ke rahane vaale ratan singh (ashutosh rana) bahut hi dabang insaan he or unki beti parthvi singh (jahnavi kapur) hai, udaipur main hi ek restaurant chalaane vaale parivaar kaa ladkaa madhukar bagala (ishan khatter) he, jo tourist guide kaa bhi kaam karata he 
 Madhukar and Parthvi meet and fall in love, which Ratan Singh and his son do not like at all, due to which the story gets a lot of twists and turns, due to which the story goes to Kolkata via Udaipur and Nagpur
 Arrives, you have to watch the film to know what happens eventually
 box offis par pehle din hi 10 karod kii kamai, kya superhit hogi dhadak?kyon dekh sakate hai:film kii kahani kaa aagaaj marathi film sarat ke jaise hi he lekin anjaam alag he
 There is a flavor of Shashank Khaitan in the film, which is also seen in the slowly growing story

 The direction of the film is quite amazing and the way Shashank Khaitan has captured Udaipur and Kolkata on camera is very much appreciated

 The cast has done a great job as Ashutosh Rana and Ishaan Khattar's friend in the film, despite being the second film, Ishaan Khattar has performed brilliantly

 There are some scenes where she appears to be acting very well
 mekars ne film kii production vailu kaaphi rich rakhi he
 Weak Links: If you compare the story of the film with the Marathi film Sairat, then this film may not live up to your expectations, Shashank Khaitan has made changes in the screenplay from time to time, the title track of the film is tremendous but Those who have heard Yad Lagla and Jhingat in Marathi may not like it in Hindi during filming
 film main romance ke saath saath honor kiling jaise mudde kii taraf bhi dhyaan dilaane kii koshish kii gai he lekin kai aisi jagah he jahaan par darshak ke taur par shaayad aapako imoshan kam najar aae

 Fakir Mohan's famous story 'dakmunsi' is the story of an English-educated young man Gopal, who makes his old rural father Hari Singh homeless

 He is now a head peon
 masik vetan nau rupee
 Everything has to be bought in Cuttack city
 aag jalaane ke liye maachis kii peti bhi kharidni padati thi
 Save as much as you can by cutting your stomach, but it did not cost less than five rupees
 kisi bhi haalat main ghar main kam se kam chaar rupee nahin bhejne se nahin chalata tha
 Gopal was the wife and eight year old son in the house
 chote se gaanv kii jagah thi
 Therefore, work was done for four rupees
 agar chaar rupee se ek paisa kam hua to mushkil ho jaati thi
 Gopal was studying in secondary school
 skool kii fees maheene main do aane thi
 Other than school fees, it used to take a lot more money to buy books
 jab kuch atirikt kharch aa jaataa tha to vah maheenaa mushkil se gujarata tha
 Sometimes the old man had to stay hungry
 vah bhookha rahe to koi baat nahin, magar uske bete kii padhai to chal rahi thi
 One day the Post Master opened the service book and said, 'hari Singh, you are fifty five years old
 ab tumhen pension milegi
 Now you will not be able to stay in the job
 'singh ke sir par vajrapaat ho gaya
 What to do? How will the home world go? Leave home, Gopal's education will be stopped
 jab se gopal paidaa hua he tab se hari singh ne man main ek sapana sanjokar rakhaa he- gopal, kasbe ke post offis main sab post-master hoga- kam se kam gaanv main post-master to hoga hi
 But it is difficult to get a job due to lack of English
 kasbe main angreji padhane kii vyavastha nahin he
 Therefore it would be appropriate to send him to Cuttack to study
 agar naukari khatm ho gai to uskaa sapana chur-chur ho jayega
 After thinking this, his body became like dry wood
 raat ko ankhon se neend gaayab ho gai thi
 Hari Singh was favored by the post-master
 unke ghar main naukar hote hue bhi offis kaa kaam khatm karne ke baad shaam ko hari singh post-master ke ghar jaakar kuch kaam kar letaa tha
 In the evening, the post-master used to make tobacco chillas while sitting in the comfort chair while reading English news
 vah jaise chilam taiyaar karata tha, koi nahin kar paata tha
 One day Hari Singh prepared a chillum and placed it in front of Babu
 babu ke munh se engine kii tarah bhak-bhak karke dhuna nikalataa tha or nashe se ankhon kii palken gir jaati thi
 Then Hari Singh felt that this is the right time
 hari singh ne post-masterji ko sashtaang dandavat karte hue haath jodakar vineet bhav se apane dukh-dard ko unke saamne rakhaa
 He did not forget to tell the dream he had woven for Gopal
 post- master babu tandravastha main the
 He said in grave posture, 'okay, give an application form
 'babuji yah kaary sahaj bhav se kar sakate the kyonki postal inspector yaa adheekshak jab daure par aate the tab ve unke bangale main hi rukate the
 He also used to make proper arrangements for food and drink for the higher officials
 us raat post-master babu baar-baar ‘hari singh, hari singh’ kahkar pukaar rahe the
 Hari Singh was a very experienced man
 kai saalon se bade-bade sahibon ko vah dekh chukaa tha
 He was well aware of his mood
 vah yah bhi acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki koun sahib kis tareeke se khush hote hai
 By midnight that day, Hari Singh had to stay in the bungalow of post-master Babu as Babu would not be able to vomit due to the polluted environment of Odisha
 ulti karne ke samay hari singh ko soda, neembu aadi kii vyavastha karne ke saath-saath babuji ko bhi sanbhaalanaa tha
 After Babuji's restful sleep, Hari Singh returned to his home to cook for midnight
 is prakaar hari singh apane upar ke bade hakimon se parichit tha
 In Hari Singh's application form, Babuji had written a good recommendation on his behalf and sent it to the city
 thode dinon ke baad ekstansion order aa gaya tha
 Hari Singh became very happy
 usne yah khushkhabari apane gaanv main bhi bhej di
 People immediately get lost in the happiness and sorrow, but their eyes do not go towards what the creator has set for them in future
 hari singh kaa yah sukh pani ke bulbule kii tarah samaapt ho gaya
 a letter came from his house that Gopal's mother had a typhus and had no hope of living
 hari singh ne post-master babu ko vah chitthee dikhaai
 Babu was very kind-hearted, and immediately granted leave to go home
 ek hi jatke main hari singh apane ghar chalaa gaya
 Seeing what he saw upon reaching home, his eyes twinkled
 yah sansar maano andhkaar main lupt ho gaya
 His wife was moribund
 pati ko dhundhlee ankhon se dekhte hue dono haath uthaakar pranaam kiya or charan raj lene ke liye ichha vyakt kii
 Was his breath stuck just for taking the stage? After that all is quiet
 hari singh kii duniya ujaad gai
 He returned to Cuttack with his son after selling the remaining items of his house
 gopal miner skool (kaksha saat) main padhata tha
 Hari Singh was passing through difficult times as he became a pensioner
 kabhi lotaa, to kabhi kaanse ke bartan bechakar kisi tarah ghar chalata tha
 When there was a job, i used to keep two to four in a month and keep it in a savings account
 gopal ke miner skool kii padhai main sab kharch ho gaya tha
 Hari Singh used to think that after passing Gopal's minor, all the troubles would go away
 gopal ne bhi kai baar is baat par aashwaasan diya tha, 'pitaaji, bhale karj lekar mujhe padhaaen naukari lagane ke baad sara karj chuktaa kar duungaa
 'deenbandhu Dinanath heard Hari Singh's prayer
 hari singh kii khushi kii koi seemaa nahin rahi
 At the same time, the old post-master Babu was still in the job
 hari singh ne unke haath-pair pakadakar kaaphi anunay vinay kiya
 Hari Singh also had the grace of the elder
 gopal turant bhakrampur post-offis main sab post-master kii haisiyat se niyukt ho gaya
 There was a salary of twenty rupees a month
 hari singh khushi se foole nahin samaa rahe the
 Currently, he will return to his town after four months training from Sadar Post Office
 hari singh baar-baar bhagwaan ke saamne natmastak ho rahaa tha, 'dhanya prabhu, tumhaari dayaa se mujh jaise deen aadmi ke dukhon kaa nivaaran ho gaya

 The day the old man got the news of the job, he cried a lot that night, sitting in private, 'hi! If the old man were alive today, he would be so happy
 uske gopal ko bade sahib kii naukari mili he
 There would be a festive atmosphere in the house
 hai! abhaagi kii kismat main ye din dekhne ko nahin the
 Gopal became a great Sahib
 bhagwaan uski raksha kiijie
 'gopal brought the first month's salary and gave it to the old man's hand
 boodha bahut khush
 His feet did not fall on the ground
 betaa bada sahib ban gaya he, bahut sara paisa ek saath kamakar laayaa he
 Counted the money four to five times and tied it in his cleft
 agle din hadabadaakar vah bazaar kii taraf bhagkar gaya
 The shoes, kurta, dhoti, the items that were needed, were bought and brought
 gopal bada sahib ban gaya he, ab kya vahiin puraane kapade pehnegaa? lalaat dekhakar tilak lagaate hai
 In the same way, new clothes were needed
 yahaan gopal babu offis main baithkar or paanch aadamiyon kii tarah angreji likhata tha
 He started getting up and sitting with the babus
 sabhi use dakmunshi babu ke naam se bulaate the
 Full name was Gopal Chandra Singh
 yahaan gopal ghar lautakar dekhtaa tha boodha maili dhoti pahanakar kaam kar rahaa he
 - How would Gopal eat good food? - Whether he bathed or not? - Whether the wet clothes are dry or not? - The poor man has no shortage of work
 ye sari chintaaen vah din bhar karata tha
 Earlier Hari Singh used to take Hariyanam occasionally
 kuch daan-punya karata tha
 Now everyone had forgotten about Gopal
 shaayad bhagwaan yah sab dekhakar buudhe ke upar gussa ho gaye the
 As if you were saying hey Brainless, what are you doing all this? One day you will know everything
 ab gopal babu ke haav-bhav main kuch parivartan hone laga tha
 Now he started teasing him for no reason from seeing Dad
 'yah murkh he
 It is not known in English
 majdoor kahin kaa, maile kuchaile kapade pahanane vaale is aadmi ko main pitaaji kahkar sambodhit karuunga
 What will people think? On that day, there were some educated women wearing gowns
 buudhe ke sharir par kameez nahin tha
 Chhi:! Chhi:! She did not feel ashamed
 agar ise ghar se baahar nahin nikaala jaataa he to meri izzat kaa kabada ho jayega
 One day Dakmunshi Babu started saying to Dad, 'look, you haven't done anything for me
 mujhe padhaakar koi meharbaani nahin kii
 If you want, then stay here, or else go away from here
 magar yaad rakhana, agar yahaan rahanaa chaahate ho to babu log aane par ghar ke bheetar se baahar mat nikalnaa
 Hearing Gopal's words, the old man was shocked
 vah ekadam gumsum hokar baith gaya
 With whom would he talk about his son? He got a wound in his heart, which he could not even show to anyone
 jiske saamne vah apane man kii baat rakh saktaa tha, vah to is duniya se chal basii thi
 He started remembering old man
 vah man hi man khub rone laga
 While crying, he looked around, but could not find any reliable man
 boodha sukh-dukh main budhi ko khub yaad karata tha
 The old man stopped crying because his crying would destroy Gopal
 gopal agle din subah kisi kaam ke liye kasbe kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 But he did not tell or tell the old man
 subah uthakar rukii aawaaj main kehane laga, 'i baba! main gaanv ja rahaa hum
 You bring all this stuff
 zyada saamaan nahin he
 Why would you do coolie? i have no money to give to the porter
 ' gopal babu kapade pahanakar bagal main chhatari daalkar lathi ghumaate hue nikal pade
 What will the old man do now? After collecting all the things, he tied the bundle and kept it on the head
 vah dhang se chal bhi nahin paa rahaa tha
 There was no more strength left in his body
 ankhon se aansu tapakane lage
 As soon as he got up at ten places, he reached Makrampur by evening
 vilamb hone ke kaaran babu ne use danta-fatkaaraa
 The old man sat down in a sad mood
 gopal babu subah-shaam offis aane lage
 The old man used to sit in the house and watch the household work
 kabhi bhi baap-betaa baithkar sukh-dukh kii baaten nahin karte the, dakmunshi yani kasbe ke bade sahab
 How many people used to come and say hello
 murkh boodha kya jaanata he? jo uske saath baatcheet karegaa
 The climate of the town was not favorable for the old
 fever hone laga
 He started coughing with tears
 raat ko kuch zyada hi khaansee hoti thi
 Gopal Babu started having trouble sleeping
 usne apane chaparasi ko bulaakar aadesh diya, 'jaao, ise buudhe ko le jaakar kahin jhaadiyon main phenk do
 'he was a peon fool
 angreji use nahin aati thi
 Even then he was a native hearted
 vah sochane laga- kya is buudhe ko le jaakar jhaadiyon main chhodkar aana uchit hoga? fever se kaanp rahaa he
 Not a single grain went to the stomach for three days
 aadhi raat ko andhere main baahar chhodana thik nahin he
 The cough of the old person increased due to cold
 gopal babu ke gusse kii seemaa nahin rahi, usne buudhe ke seene main do angreji mukke jad die
 And picked up the bed and threw it out
 boodha apane gaanv ko laut gaya
 This was being heard from the mouths of the people around
 us din se gopal babu kaa man bahut khush he or vahaan buudhe ne bhi apane gaanv lautakar do bigha jameen kheti karne ke liye mazdooree par de di
 While sitting in the house, grain was available, pension money used to cover the cost of cloth and rags and household items
 jab se khaansee ho rahi thi tab se vah opium khaane kaa aadi ho gaya
 But all his expenses would go away comfortably
 baraamde main baithkar vah bhagwaan kaa naam letaa tha
 Now both father and son were happy
 pathak mahashay dusron kaa sukh dekhakar khush honge

 From the paradise of the earth to the Jantar Mantar in Delhi, people are demanding justice for the victim's family and punishment for the guilty
 lekin ab aisi koshishen bhi hone lagi hai jo na sirf is andolan ke peeche ke pramukh chehron par sawaal khadaa kar rahi hai balki is andolan ke makasad ko bhi bhatka hua dikhaa rahi hai
 Under these efforts, an audio regarding the Kathua case has gone viral
 3 minute 52 second ke is audio ke jariye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kathua balaatkaar peedita ke parivaar ko nyaay dilaane ke naam par 70 lakh rupee jutaaye gaye lekin wo peedit parivaar tak pahunche hi nahin
 The tapes accused the victim's lawyer Talib Hussain, Deepika Singh Rajawat and JNU student leader Shehla Rashid for embezzling funds raised for the victim's family
 audio main kya baatcheet ho rahi he?audio main jammu nivasee or ol india trib koordination cameti ke adhyaksh choudhary najaakat khataana or 'majaloom kii aawaaj' naam kaa ek sanghathan chalaane vaale vaqaar bhatti ke bich 15 april ko hui baatcheet darj he
 In the audio, Najakat says that Talib had brought 60-70 lakh rupees from Delhi in the name of the victim's family and he along with Shehla Rashid is cashing the victim's family while those people are fighting the real battle of justice for the victim
 vakaar bhi kahata he ki unhone bacchee kaa photo viral karaayaa, jammu band karaayaa or candal march nikalvaaya lekin talib, deepika or shehla phayda uthaa rahe hai
 Waqar says with gratitude, tell the truth to the girl's family and do it in your court
 ladki kaa parivaar yadi hamaare paas aayaa to ham das din ke andar lakhon rupee unke acount main dalava denge
 Waqar claims that he had donated 25 lakh rupees to a person's account after taking donations from people and he would say on a five-minute video that if he helps this family, lakhs of rupees will come
 baatcheet main vakaar ye bhi kehete hai ki 24 april ko actor ejaj khan parivaar se milane mumbai se aa rahe hai or wo parivaar ko sidhe unase madad dilavaayenge
 Who recorded this audio tape? Aajtak about audio
 in ne vakaar bhatti se poocha to unhone kaha ki talib se jude kuch logon ne hi unase ye sab kaha he ki talib bacchee ke nampar paise juta rahaa he lekin unhen kuch nahin mil rahaa
 They are fighting for the victim but Deepika, Shehla and Talib are getting all the accolades
 mere paas koi saboot nahin he lekin yah to poocha hi janaa chahie talib se ki wo jo baar-baar dilli se jammu aa-ja rahaa he, uskaa kharchaa kahaan se aa rahaa he?’vakaar bhatti ne mana ki unhone hi ye baatcheet record kii thi or khud hi is recording ko apane ek dost ko bheja tha
 On the other hand, Nazqat Khatana rejected Waqar's statement that he had called Waqar and told him something like this
 ulte unhone vakaar par khud ko istemaal karne kaa aarope madh diya
 On the allegations leveled against him, he said, 'talib and we were together
 lekin wo pichley kuch din se meraa phone nahin uthaata
 Does not call me anywhere
 mujhase kuch poochta nahin he
 i only want him to tell me what he is doing? If you are going to Delhi, what are you doing? i was told by my boys that he has raised so much money because of the bungling of money
 ham jameen par bacchee ke insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai lekin hamen koi puch nahin rahaa he
 All are talking about Talib, Shehla and Deepika while Shehla is from Delhi
 talib or deepika keval vakil hai jabaki maine in haathon se bacchee ko dafnaaya he
 'what is Shehla and Talib's cleaning on the charges? Aajtak
 in ne aaropon par shehla se bhi unka paksh janaa
 Baqul Shehla 'there is no truth in these allegations
 kisi ke paas koi cash nahin he
 Neither to me nor to Talib nor to Deepika
 ye log aisa kyon kah rahe hai wo to yahi jaanate honge lekin sachai yah he ki hamane ek croud funding website www
 crowdnewsing
 com ke jariye fund ikattha kiya tha
 Initially we had decided that some four-five lakh rupees would be collected which would lead to a legal battle, but when Deepika said that she would not take a penny in this case, then we decided that whatever money will come, she will be paid by Unnao and Kathua
 The victims will be divided equally among the families
 ’wo aage bataati hai, 'kathua maamle ke peedit parivaar apana acount khulavaa rahe hai aisa mujhe talib or deepika ke marfat pataa chalaa he or unnav maamle ke peedit parivaar ne pan card ke liye applai kiya he
 We did not ask for any money in anyone's account
 abhi tak kareeb-kareeb 45 lakh rupee ikattha hue hai or saare ke saare paise www
 crowdnewsing
 com or usko saport de rahi www
 ketto
 org ke paas hi hai
 If anyone has any doubt about this, then they can take complete information from there
 ’shehla par doosraa aarope yah he ki wo dilli main rahati hai or kaaphi baad main kathua maamle se judi hai
 Regarding this, Shehla says, 'even though i tell you this is very strange
 maine farvari main sabase pehle is maamle ko lekar ek twit kiya tha
 In this tweet, i had asked for an explanation by tagging Mehbooba Mufti, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, since which i have been constantly associated with this matter
 mujhe jahaan-jahaan mauka mila maine is maamle ko uthaaya
 i even raised this issue from the India Today Conclave forum
 jo log abhi aisi-waisi baat kar rahe hai wo bhi shuru-shuru main mujhe phone karte the or maamle ke saath judane ke liye shukriya bolte the
 Now do not know why these people are saying this? ”regarding the allegations leveled against him, Talib Hussain said that these two people have become part of the conspiracy under which the justice of the girl child should be directed towards Talib, Deepika and Shehla An attempt is being made to shift
 jane-anjaane ye log ek badi sajeesh kaa shikaar ho gaye hai
 If anyone feels that i or anyone else has done any embezzlement then get a separate investigation done and if that investigation proves to be a mistake of one rupee, then i am ready to face any punishment
 ’kathua cese ko ho rahaa nuksanjammu main ajtak ke beurochif ashvini kumaar ke mutabik yah kahana to mushkil he ki koun sach bol rahaa he or koun jhooth lekin talib padhaa-likhaa he
 He has taken up the matter from the beginning
 hamen bhi vahi lekar gaya tha
 Now some people are blaming him
 is tu-tu, main-main kii vajah se kathua maamle ko bada nuksaan ho rahaa he

 ' un par jameen par kabja karne kaa aarope he
 Telugu media stalwart Cherukuri Ramoji Rao, through his company, Guidi Chit Fund Pvt Ltd, allegedly at Palamukala village near Hyderabad Airport
5
 2 acre sarkari jameen par kabja kar liya he
 Authorities in the Ranga Reddy district in which the airport is located have given notice to Rao's firm on August 25 and sought clarification as to why the land should not be withdrawn from them and the encroachment action initiated
 jameen ke irdagird baad ke saath banaai gai ek diwaar dhaha di gai he, jis par kuch samay tak get par lage ek chote-se board par mgf gardens kaa naam likhaa tha
 To determine the extent of the encroachment, the district officials have matched the revenue records and survey maps with the ground situation
 bakaul ek adhikari, ''ham bhu-atikaraman adhinium, 1905 ke tahat uchit karrwai karenge
 "the guide has given this land to the Hyderabad-based developer of My Home Group before the new international airport was built in Shamshabad
" rameshwar raav se kharidi thi
 The 74-year-old Ramoji, who refrained from talking to the media, published a rebuttal on the front page in the August 2 issue of his popular Telugu daily Eenadu, in which he wrote, "in Palamukla village, after land verification and due legal process
 Purchased after completing
 hamane koi niyam nahin todaa yaa kahin bhi sarkari jameen athwa kisi duusare ke naam kii jameen par atikaraman nahin kiya
 While stating that only 319 acres of land was purchased in Palamukla, Ramoji made it clear in his statement, "there should be no doubt that my group should leave aside the interests of farmers in the purchase of land
" , Has not done anything against public interest
 sampatti kii kharid main hamane koi dhokhebaaji nahin kii he or chal rahaa sara prachaar hamen badnaam karne kaa sochaa-samaj prayaas he
 "but the revenue authorities claim that the Palamukla estate includes government land
 ramoji ne surveykshan evam bhu-abhilekh adhikariyon ko arji di he ki ve unki jameen se sambandhit saare record kii jaanch karen or bataaen ki kya usamen koi sarkari yaa kisi duusare ke naam kii jameen he
 He says that the My Home group, from which the Guidari group bought the land, bought it from the previous owners in 1995
 pehle maalikon ke paas is jameen kaa kabja 1965 se tha
 Ramoji gave money to his employees to buy this land at throwaway prices even before four years of the airport
 phir, unhone bhoomi upyog badalawa kar use gaiyr-krishi jameen karvaa diya or antat use apane karmchaariyon se waapas kharid liya

 But Ramoji says that his group had bought only 319 acres of land, of which 315 acres was purchased from My Home Group
 ramoji ke khilaaf yahi ek aarope nahin he
 Ground property of his sons (156
 68 acre) andhra pradesh bhoomi sudhaar (krishi bhoomi swaamitv kii ceiling) adhinium, 1973 main nirdhaarit kii gai seemaa se adhik he
 The ceiling under this Act, which came into force from January 1, 1975, ranges from 10 acres to 54 acres per family, depending on the category and class of land

 There are also some old cases of land grab against the Rao family
 andhra pradesh sadak parivahan nigam ke purv adhyaksh ji
 Prakash Rao alleges that Vai
 es
 Every chief minister, except Rajasekhara Reddy, has been soft on Ramoji
 ramoji akhbaar maalik hone ke apane dabadabe kaa istemaal bhi karte rahe hai
 Prakash Rao gives an example of how Ramoji has got one gate (in Rangareddy district) at Anjanpur village and another at Naganapalli village on a public road that runs through his Ramoji Film City
 isaki vajah se sthaneey logon ko 12 kilometre lanbaa rasta apnaanaa padataa he
 Another charge 14 in Naganapalli village
 30 acre jameen ko lekar he, jo ramoji film city kaa hissaa thi
 Although the state government had acquired this land and distributed lease certificates to 606 families, the beneficiaries were not allowed to access it
 2010 main sarkari jaanch hone ke baad, jisamen ramoji film city dwaara kiye gaye atikaraman ko chinhit kiya gaya tha, jila adhikariyon ne rajya sarkaar ko suchit kiya ki atikaraman hataane ke liye aadesh de die gaye hai
 Prakash Rao claims, "it is a case of widespread encroachment, as the majority of Ramoji Film City, spread over 1,600 acres, is a Court of Wards property
" '' court of wards adhinium sarkaar ko un sampattiyon kaa abhirakshak banane kaa adhikaar detaa he, jinke maalik kii maut ho jaae or uske kanoonee vaaris avyask hon
 Prakash Rao, this property belongs to Ghalib Jung, an assistant to the sixth Nizam, Mehboob Ali Khan of Hyderabad
 1904 main jab uski maut hui to vah court of wards ko saunp di gai, uske bete ko nahin di gai, kyonki vah 'maansik taur par asthir' tha
 Prakash Rao says that since the law in this case has remained dormant, the government has failed to periodically review such assets, identify legal heirs and issue assets
 ve kehete hai, court of wards sampattiyon kii samiksha atikaraman karne waalon kaa pardaafash kar degi or unhone ramoji film city kii jameen ke swaamitv kii jaanch ke liye lokayukta se sampark kiya he
 "this is an effort that will take a lot of time," explains Prakash Rao
 vajah yah he ki har kadam par kanoonee adchane hai
 "but the long list of cases against Ramoji and his sons tells a different story
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa dakshin bharat ke rajyakeral ke vynadse ladane kaa faisla kaa kitna asar rahaa he yah to 23 may ko aane vaale nattejey bataaenge lekin agsit pole ke nattejey bataa rahe hai ki congress kophayda hota dikhaai de rahaa he
 However, this effect is limited to Kerala and Tamil Nadu
 enditivi pole of pols ke mutabik andhra pradesh kii 25 siton main tidipi ko 10, wiesar congress ko 15, congress or bijepi ko koi bhi seat milti nahin dikhaai de rahi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, TDP got 15 seats, YSR Congress 8, BJP 2 and Congress did not get a single seat
 dakshin ke is rajya main congress ko phayda hote nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 Now talk about Karnataka, according to the NDTV Poll of Polls, out of 28 seats in the state, the ruling congress-jds is not going to 9, BJP and 19 others are not going to get a single seat
 saal 2014 ke aankadon se dekhen to is chunaav main bijepi ko 17 or congress ko 9 ou jedies ko 2 siten mili thim
 Now talk about Rahul Gandhi contested from Wayanad seat of Kerala
 enditivi pole of pols ke mutabik congress gathbandhan ko 14, vamadalon ko 4, bijepi ko 1 or anya ke khate main 1 seat jate dikhaai de rahi he
 At the same time, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got 11 seats, the Left parties 7 and others got one seat
 tamilnadu main is baar do diggaj purv mukhyamantri jayalalita or karunanidhi ke bina loksabhaa chunaav hua he
 With the absence of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, the AIADMK and DMK continue to have internal tussle
 bijepi ne sattarudh ediemke ke saath gathbandhan kiya he or congress ne diemke ke saath
 According to the NDTV Poll of Polls, out of 39 seats in the state, AIADMK + BJP 11, DMK + Congress 27 and others do not see a single seat going into account
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ediemke ko 37, bijepi ko 2 or piemke ko 1 seat mili thi
 According to NDTV Poll of Polls in Telangana's 17 seats separated from Andhra Pradesh, the ruling TRS is seen getting 12 seats, Congress 2, BJP 1 and others 1
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tiares ko 11, bijepi ko 1, congress ko 2 or anya ke khate main 3 siten gai thim
 If the results remain the same, the Congress does not see much benefit in any state except Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 karnataka kii 28, andhra pradesh kii 25, kerala kii 20, telugana kii 17, puduccheri kii 1, tamilnadu kii 39 siten milakar yahaan par kul 130 site hai
 a major reason behind Congress President Rahul Gandhi contesting in Wayanad is also being considered that the entire focus of the Congress is now to make inroads in the states of the south as it has regional parties in North India like SP-BSP in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar In many other parties including RJD, it will not be so easy to overcome TMC in West Bengal and Biju Janata Dal in Odisha and these secrets Why, along with BJP, these parties will have to increase the vote bank equally which is not so easy
 lekin dakshin kii raajnneeti main use sambhawana dikh rahi he or yah congress ke liye 'ek tir se 130 nishane' lagane vaala daanv tha

 maharashtra main chunavi nattejey ke baad bijepi shivasena ke saamne ek shart rakh sakati he
 According to sources, the news is coming that Uddhav Thackeray may be asked to apologize on the statement that the PM is called Chaiwala
 agar wo aisa nahin karte hai to phir centre main shivasena ke mantri anant geete ko hatane ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Currently, the results of the Maharashtra Assembly elections are awaited on October 19
 aam aadmi PM ban saktaa he, to main CM kyon nahin: uddhav thakaragauratlab he ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar shivasena or bijepi ke bich 25 saal purana gathbandhan tut gaya he
 Since then, the relationship between the two parties has been talked about
 chunavi prachaar ke dauraan jamkar siyaasi bayaanbaji hui
 However, Prime Minister Modi said at a rally that he would not speak anything about the Shiv Sena as he respected Bal Thackeray
 par uddhav thakare ne baar-baar bijepi or narendra modi par dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya
 The Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' was also handled on their behalf
 saamana ne gathbandhan tuutane ke baad se kabhi bijepi ko pitrupaksh ke kauwe to kabhi maharashtra kaa dushman bataaya
 The status quo remained intact when Shiv Sena minister Anant Geete remained in the Modi government amid rhetoric
 haalanki chunaav se thik ek din pehle dopaher saamana main shivasena ke ek lekh ne siyaasi bavaal khadaa kar diya
 In this article, Uddhav Thackeray wrote, 'when a chaiwala can become the Prime Minister of the country, why am i not the CM of Maharashtra?' Got upset about this
 iske baad saamana ne chywala shabd hataakar aam aadmi kaa istemaal kiya, par kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 The Shiv Sena's rhetoric to the BJP has gone downhill
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne do took kah diya ki party piem kaa apmaan nahin sahegi
 Due to this article, now the relationship between the two parties has deteriorated further
 agsit pole ke kaaran badla bijepi kaa tevarchiwale bayaan par ab tak zyada kuch nahin kehane vaali bijepi ne achaanak hi sakht ravaiya apana liya
 Exit poll estimates are also an important reason behind this
 chunaav se pehle party is kashmakash thi ki uski kitni siten aaengi
 Will have to tie up with Shiv Sena again
 par ab jab zyaadaatar pole bijepi ko bahumat ke aankade ke paas dikhaa rahe hai, to aise main party ne shivasena ko apana rukh bataa diya he
 It will now be seen what the Shiv Sena says on this condition of the BJP

 a new petition was filed by the NDMC on Wednesday for the removal of street vendors in Delhi that the High Court should change its order dated September 9, in which the High Court had completely stayed the removal of street vendors
 saath hi NDMC kii taraf se ho rahe survey ko bhi roak diya gaya tha
 In the new application, NDMC has sought permission from the court to complete the survey
 kyonki NDMC kaa tark he ki 90 fisadi survey ho chukaa he
 NDMC said that in this case it is very important to do this survey to fix law and order
 agar survey puraa hota he to agar koi bhi vendor kuch galat karnaa market main paaya jaataa he to usko pakadana aasaan hoga
 NDMC told the court that while conducting the survey several times, the officers have also attacked the mafia there
 jisaki FIR bhi darj karavaayi gayi he
 After the High Court stay, the street tracks mafia are taking advantage of this order wrongly
 NDMC ne kaha ki dilli main sabase pehle toun vending cameti ham logon ne banaayi he
 Its job is to find out who are the real street vendors and who are sitting in illegal possession
 survey 25 july se shuru kiya gaya tha or 90 fisadi puraa ho chukaa he
 NDMC argued in the court that illegal construction in the markets leads to traffic jams
 ek dukaan main kai kai nirmaan kar liye gaye hai
 Which is very important to stop
 lihaaza survey ko puraa karne ke aadesh hai court de
 At the same time, many market associations argued that no vendor should be allowed to enter the no vendor zone
 lekin unke liye vending jone main baithne kii puri vyavastha honi chahie
 The High Court said that we know that the stay that we have put is about keeping the place where people are at present (street vendors)
 unako police yaa MCD waha se na hathaaye
 On September 9, the Delhi High Court banned the removal of any street vendors in Delhi
 hai court ne dilli sarkaar, police, sabhi emsidi or alji ko notice dekar zawaab maanga tha
 The petition has been filed by Congress leader Ajay Maken
 hai court ke is aadesh ke baad dilli ke rehadi patari waalon ko filhal police or emsidi nahin hataa paa rahi hai
 The High Court has ordered that till the survey related to their count in Delhi is completed and at the same time the government does not make any concrete policy for the street vendors, which should not be removed from the vendor where it is
 ye yachika congress netaa ajay maakan kii taraf se lagaaya gayi thi
 The court has also asked the government, police and all mcds to give their reply on this
 dilli ke lajpat nagar, sarojini nagar, karol baag, lodhi road jaise alag alag ilaaqon main police or emsidi rehadi patari waalon ko lagaataar hataa rahi thi
 The hearing of the court case lasted for about two and a half hours and in the meantime NDMC, Market Association, Vendor Association all expressed their views to the court
