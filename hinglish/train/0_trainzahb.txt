i have no doubt that the company would have followed the best global testing practices in India as well
 mujhe lagata he ki sarkaar ise jarurat se zyada tool de rahi he
 This was the opinion of many brand experts and company analysts India Today spoke to
 agar upabhokta is baat se hairaan the ki unki priy megi maanav upbhog ke liye anupyukt thi, to nestle bhi yah jaanakar sadame kii sthiti main aa gai thi, jab company ko pataa chalaa tha ki pareekshan main megi ke namoonon main monosodium glutamet (ems) or sise kaa str adhik paaya gaya&yah pataa bhi kisi sarkari praadhikaran ke madhyam se nahin chalaa, balki tab chalaa jab uttar pradesh ke khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan (epad) ne prayogshaala ke nishkarshon ko saarvajanik karne kaa faisla kiya

 Also Maggie can be kept for six months
 phir unhone hamen unase baat karne kaa mauka die bina nateezon ko saarvajanik kar diya
 However, according to food safety experts, expiry of a product does not affect the level of lead in it
 company ne yah doharaate hue ki utpaada surakshit he, swechha se sabhi tarah kii megi ko waapas le liya, lekin uttarakhand ko chhodkar usne abhi tak utpaada waapas lene ke rajyon ke aadesh ke khilaaf apil nahin kii he
 If Nestlé does not accept the states' findings, it legally has the right to appeal
 company kaa kahana he ki vah duusare rajyon se aadhikarik soochna kaa intjaar kar rahi he, jabaki bhartiya khaadya suraksha or maanak praadhikaran (ethesai) jor dekar kahata he ki use jo bhi kuch kahana tha, vah uski website par uplabdh he
 Nestlé continues to follow its own testing protocol of testing by mixing noodle cakes with the tastemaker, as the product is consumed in this manner
 pareekshan kii bhinn report aane ke pramukh kaarnon main ek yah he ki bhartiya khaadya suraksha or maanak praadhikaran donon utpaadon kaa alag-alag pareekshan karata he
 a senior Nestle official says that this is not the first time that our samples have been taken for testing
 vastav main, jab 15 maheene pehle namoonay liye gaye the or uske baad unke bare main koi baat nahin hui thi, tab hamane iske bare main sochaa bhi nahin tha
 They cite the best production practices in India, saying that "you can add as many flavor enhancers as you like
" noodles ke liye koi seemaa nahin he
 If there is no limit, how can you stop someone? " Whereas FSSAI states that India does not allow additional MSG
 aage kya hoga? vaishvik siio paul balke kah chuke hai ki company yathasambhav sheeghra vaapasi karegi
 Meanwhile, FSSAI is still waiting for what Nestle proposes to do next to bring Maggie back to the market

 When you look at my entire journey, you will find that it has always been about my friends and family
 unki taraf se bhi aisa hi he
 And if you look at my journey, i have got love from children, old people and families from the first film 'maine Pyar Kiya'

 For me the journey of the last thirty years has been amazing in many ways
 aap pichley 30 saalon se bollywood industry par raaj kar rahe hai

 After Bajrangi Bhaijaan are you seen trying to get out of the comfort zone with each of your films? Actually, this is my comfort zone
 jab aapke paas ek behtareen script hoti he to aap uske liye confort jone se baahar nikal hi jate ho
 However, a bad script is very difficult to hit
 aap chaahe kitne bhi achche actor kyon naa ho, ek kharaab script ko hit karana lagbhag naammumkin hai
 Since Bajrangi Bhaijaan, you are choosing a similar script from which the audience is able to relive a lot
 main aisa bajrangi bhaijan se pehle se kar rahaa hum
 There was a time when i became a little relaxed in life and i used to do films produced by my friends that this will be done, i will do it
 iske baad mujhe ehsaas hua ki wo kaam kaaphi ausat tha
 i had also done that work because nothing was coming better on my part
 maine un filmon main apana best diya or unamem se bhi zyaadaatar filmon ne acha pradarshan kiya
 After that i thought of doing something different in 'tere Naam'
 phir tiger main apane desh ke liye pyaar, bajrangi bhaijan main choti si ladki ko lekar pyaar
 In all these films, the audience got to see some larger than life elements and i too enjoyed playing these characters
 kisi bhi film kaa naireshan sunate vakt agar mujhe neend aa gai yaa phir mujhe majaa nahin aayaa to main us film ko nahin karata hum
 i should have encouraged the film from the first generation

 kya ye isliye bhi tha ki aapaki film ek saaf suthri, feet for family film he?nahin, main apni film bharat ko kisi bhi rup main pramot karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 This film is shot mostly in India
 main ye bhi koshish karata hum ki jis bhi rajya main ja rahaa hum us rajya ko pramot karun
 Like i was in Madhya Pradesh some time ago, i was promoting that state
 isse pehle main arunachal pradesh bhi gaya tha or usase pehle main kashmir bhi gaya tha
 Wherever i go, i try to promote that place without being the brand ambassador of that place
 kyonki mujhe pataa he ki hamaara desh behad khubasurat he or main is desh main tourism ko pramot karte hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 i like to shoot in Kashmir
 kai filmon ko bina research ke shoot kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bharat jaisi film, jiske saath kai aitihaasik nerrative bhi jude hai, kya aap inase jude reference ko padhate hai? yaa phir aap aise cese main puri tarah se nirdeshak par nirbhar hote hai ?haa, mujhe film ke bare main kaaphi kuch to pataa hota he
 When i get information, i read it
 isamen ye he ki vishwacap kaa reference he, iske alaava abu dhabi ke andar jab tel niklaa tha or kaise log vahaan gaye the
 And there was a round of merchant navy when all the merchant navy were joining
 jai jawan jai kisaan vaala hissaa bhi milegaa

 Apart from this, there is a larger than life image in the backdrop
 aapaki filmon main gane aksar hindi or angrezi gaano ke mix hote hai or ve kuch aise hote hai jo aapaki persenality or story ko match karte hai
 Do you also participate in the creation of songs from your films? Yes, i am very interested in the music of my films
 main film ke mujeec par aakhri faisla letaa hum
 Vishal Shekhar is a good musician
 hamaare paas 5-6 gane hai or ye sabhi gane kaaphi achche ban pade hai
 Today's phase is different
 gaanaa kisi bhi film main aajkal pehali chiz hota he
 Nowadays there is a lot of pressure on music directors
 nirdeshkon par bhi kaaphi pressure rahata he taaki ve sahi gane ko chun saken
 Each test is different 
 mujeec hi kuch diferent chal rahaa he
 i am doing some different music
 wo bhi chal rahaa he
 People say that Salman Khan is in the film, so the music of the film is good
 lekin aisa nahin he
 If people liked the sound and liked the feel, then people listen
 zyaadaatar jo gane hai, wo jab koi do teen saal kaa baccha wo gaanaa shuru karata he, wo barometer he ki ye gaanaa hit he
 i do not wait for any music pundit to express his opinion on the songs of the film
 mujhe lagata he ki mere liye us bachche kii raay myne rakhti he
 i am not making films for other actors, nor am i making films to impress critics
 main filmein banaata hum taaki mere phens theatre jaaen or acha samay bitaayen
 Get to learn a little bit, dance a little, cry a little bit, and take a little bit of 10-15 percent of that character at home and try to take it into your life
 katrina ne haal hi main kaha ki ve salmaan khan kii har film main nahin ho sakati hai
 Do you choose actresses in your production house? agar film ke diarector kehete hai ki katrina ko lenaa chahie to katrina ke naam par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 For example, i did the film Dabangg
 is film ke duusare part main bhi sonakshi sinha hi dikhaai deen
 According to me, whenever there will be a domineering film, then - Sonakshi will be seen in the film
 aise hi kik main jacleen hai
 Jacqueline will also be seen in Kick's Part 2
 tiger series main hameshaa katrina hi hongi
 We cannot take actresses lightly
 ham aapke bare main sabhi acchhee baaten jaanate hai
 What is the one thing about you that makes you bad? There are many bad things
 bahut hi buree
 But i can't share them
 wo buree chizein aisi hai jinhen main apni kabr tak saath lekar jaaoongaa

 Malik said that Sajjad Lone was also saying that he too has enough mlas
 unke vidhayakon ko bhi dhamkaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, i did not want to be biased by giving Lone a chance

 The tenure of the Governor's rule was going to be completed, in view of which there was a manipulation to form a government in the state

 Would you prefer that the leadership of the party be given to a man who believes in the ideology of the RSS? Who will be the leader, the party will decide
 ham sirf yah chaahate hai ki netaa aisa ho jo hamaari vichaardhaara ko aage le jaae, team work main vishwaas rakhata ho, nai peedi ko protsaahit kare
 And it is clear that if the party is 'a different party from others' then why is it
 kuch aise sanghathan hai jo sangh kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Still they are considered as part of it like Sriram Sene of Karnataka, Pragya Thakur

 We must free our neighbors from the claws of China
 kya china ne hamen kootneeti main haraa diya he?peeche kar diya he, haraaya nahin he
 We can still do something
 pakistan ke maamle main bhaajapa bhramit lagati he
 What is the view of RSS? The existence of Pakistan rests on anti-india
 pakistan ko uski karatuuton kaa karaara jawaab diya janaa chahie
 We need another military victory over Pakistan
 shaayad isi tareeke se ham 26 / 11 jaise aatankwaadi hamalon ko roak sakate hai
 Have we missed the chance of military victory? When the Parliament was attacked and then the 26 / 11 attack
 us samay hamaari sarkaar vifal rahi
 We lacked willpower
 kya aap maanate hai ki bharat ke liye ek majboot or sthaayee pakistan thik rahegaa?agar pakistan maansik rup se swasth ho or bharat virdohi bhaawanaaon ko chhod de, tabhi bharat ke liye acha hoga

 Political parties have come into a cautious mode about this
 har party apane-apane netaaon se aapasi matbhed bhulaakar saath aane kii apil kar rahi he
 But Ramesh Bidhuri, MP from South Delhi of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is angry with the party's social media and Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari
 dilli bijepi kii soshal media meet ke maukey par unki baton se aisa laga ki dilli bijepi main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahi he
 a hallmark of differences between mps was seen in this meeting
 is meeting main dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari, soshal media ke head neelkant bakshi, anuraag thakur, dilli bijepi main mahaamantri kulajit chahal ke alawa dakshini dilli se sansad ramesh bidhudi bhi maujuud rahe
 During the social media meet, MP Ramesh Bidhuri criticized and criticized Manoj Tiwari and social media team in gestures
 ramesh bidhudi ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi kii lokapriyata hajaaron kaaryakartaaon ke kaam or soshal media ke madhyam se badi he
 Our works have reached the masses through social media
 aap sab ek vichaardhaara ko lekar soshal media main kaam kar rahe hai
 After 20 years, BJP came to Delhi again, so they are working
 lekin jab ham ek vichaar ko chhodkar vyakti aadhaarit ho jate hai, to wo chizein zyada nuksaan karti hai
 Ramesh Bidhuri said, 'after being person-based, we promote it is a good thing
 lekin ye dikhaa kar karen ki aapkaa jo pratidwandvi he usko samaapt karke aapako pramot karenge to musiibat hoti he
 i have seen a lot in our social media for the last 6-8 months
 ham or bhi aage bad sakate the
 Instead of 57 per cent, 62 per cent votes could have been brought to Delhi
 desh ko bataa sakate the ki dilli main bijepi ne aitihaasik jeet hasil kii he
 'he said,' The leadership of the party has to think, which is to think
 aapke-hamaare soshal media main aalochana karne se kuch nahin hoga
 The party leadership is aware of who is doing well, who is doing what
 aapke hamaare sochane se kya hoga?'unhone kaha, 'agar ramesh bidhudi ko thokna he to usase kya hoga? party bhi saath thuk rahi he
 The party is losing one seat
 par aapako kya milegaa? usase aapako vaahvahee jab hi milegi, jab aapaki sarkaar satta main aegi
 But somewhere we use party platform to set our score
 is par soshal media ke pramukhon ko dhyaan dena padegaa
 However Manoj ji is sitting here and it is also true that he does not agree with me more
 ramesh bidhudi ne kaha ki soshal media kaa apana mahatv he aisa nahin he ki pichhali sarkaar main yojanaayen nahin lagu hui thim
 But the biggest challenge was to bring the benefits of those schemes to the public
 par aaj soshal media ke madhyam se bijepi kii yojanaayen jan-jan tak pahunch rahi hai
 People are getting benefit of those schemes
 ramesh bidhudi ne kaha, 'dakshini dilli main party ke naam se saalon roti khaane vaale log jhaadu par chale gaye or jo jameen par kaam karne vaale log party main hi hai
 Is there any benefit? jinhen samajhnaa tha samaj gaye jo naa samajhe wo anaadi
 Since this statement of Ramesh Bidhuri, the internal unity of the BJP is bound to raise questions
 aise main ab dekhnaa he ki chunaav se pehle bijepi kaa sheersh netritv party main chal rahe aapasi matbhed ko sulajhaa paata he yaa nahin

 supreme court ne vibhinn companiyon ko 1993 se aavantit kiye gaye 218 koyala blokon main se 214 ke aavanton radd kar die
 The three-member bench headed by Chief Justice RM Lodha did not cancel the allocation of just four coal blocks
 radd hone se bache koyala blaakon main antipisi or cell ke ek-ek blaak or do block ati vrihad vidyut pariyojnaon ke liye die gaye hai
 The court directed the companies to make up for the loss of revenue of the government, which had not yet started the coal extraction work
 court ne kaig ke is nishkarsh ko sweekaar kiya ki in koyala blokon main utpaadan chaalu nahin hone ke kaaran 295 rupee prati ton kii dar se rajasav kaa nuksaan hua
 The court said that only government coal blocks will remain
 court ne 218 kol blokon ko avaidh bataaya tha, jisamen se 214 usne radd kar die hai
 Also, relief has not been given to the 46 coal blocks that have been commissioned, however, they will have to complete the work in six months
 isse pehle 25 agast ko supreme court ne aitihaasik faisla sunaate hue 1993 se abhi tak saare kol aavanton ko avaidh qaraar diya tha
 In its judgment, the Supreme Court said that all these allocations were done arbitrarily
 pichley do dashak main 36 screening cametiyon ne avaidh or manamaane tareeke se kol block aavantit kiye
 Neither were these allocations transparent nor were they done correctly
 haalanki centre sarkaar ne halafanama daayar karke 46 kol block aavanton ko radd na karne kii maang kii thi
 Significantly, the case of the coal block may have sprung up during the time of the Manmohan government, but the investigation was done all round
 jharkhand, chhatisgarh, maharashtra, pashchim bengal, odisha or madhya pradesh ke 218 kol blox 1993 se 2010 ke bich aavantit hue
 The court suggested that because the matter is related to the economy, a committee should be constituted under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge
 supreme court ne aage sunwaayee kii or 9 sitambar ko apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 During the hearing on September 1, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, on behalf of the Government of India, said in the Supreme Court that even if the court cancels all the allocations, the government is ready, but if possible, 46 blocks which are either started Have been or are about to begin
 iske liye 295 rupee prati ton kaa jurmaana vasula ja saktaa he
 The court should issue an order in this matter immediately and do not form any committee
 desh main bijli ke halaat thik nahin or aise main jald dobaaraa aavanton jaruri he
 In the hearing on 9 September, the central government said that all the allocations should be canceled and the blocks which are going on, be handed over to Coal India or let 46 coal blocks run on the lines of 2G spectrum till new allocations are made
 sunwaayee ke dauraan mining se judi companiyon ne bhi supreme court main apni baat rakhi
 On behalf of the companies in the court, it was said that before giving any order, they should also be heard

 The war of words began between India and Australian cricketers ahead of the third important Test here, in which senior players from both teams took on each other and Brad Haddin started India as a 'weak' team
 hadine ne bhartiya team ko maujuuda samay kii sabase kamjor team kaha tha
 Haddin told the media here, 'we know that this team can be weak like any team in the world
 ’ unhone kaha tha ki agar chijen bhartiya team ke paksh main nahin hoti to vah duniya kii kisi team se jaldi bikhar sakati he
 India's fast bowler Zaheer Khan lashed out at Haddin, saying that the Australian wicketkeeper should focus on improving his own performance rather than trying to put psychological pressure on the visiting team
 jahir ne kaha, ‘hadine ko apni wicketcaping kii chintaa kerani chahie
 i really find it weak
 use move karnaa shuru kar dena chahie
 Australian fast bowler Peter Siddle also reacted strongly to this and said that Zaheer took Haddin's words wrong
 sidle ne kaha, ‘jahir kah rahaa he ki hadine ko apni keeping par dhyaan dena chahie, main dekhnaa chahta hum ki wicketcaping par jahir kitni achche gur siikhaa sakate hai
 ' sidle ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata he ki yah uskaa kaam he
 Zaheer said that Haddin's remarks were only to create psychological pressure on the visiting team, which is trailing 0-2 in the four-test series
 teesraa test yahaan shuukravaar se shuru hoga
 The comments jahir ne kaha, ‘vah kaaphi bayaan de rahaa he
 Certainly he is playing his role
 ’ unhone kaha ki haalanki riki ponting ne sidney main duusare test main saikadaa jadaa tha, lekin vah us tarah ke ballebaaj nahin lag rahe the, jaise vah hua karte the
 He said, 'all i can say is that Ponting batted well
 lekin riki ponting ab apni puraani farm main nahin the
 This is not his natural game
 lekin shatak to shatak hi hota he or iskaa puraa shrey use miltaa he
 ' hadine ne bhartiya team ko maujuuda samay kii sabase kamjor team kaha tha

 3
 bijli kii killat sabase kamadaava : killat ghatakar kareeb saadhe 3 fisadi rahi, jo ab tak main sabase kam he
 Truth: In 2006-10, the shortage was around 10%, which came down to around 4% in 2013-14

 dilli ke takht kaa daavedaar ghoshit hote hi lagata he mizaaj badal gaya he narendra modi kaa
 Modi had once avoided a hat, but the BJP has made a formula ten to put the Sardar of Gujarat on the throne of Delhi
 makasad he modi par alpsankhyakon ko rijhaanaa or iskaa pareekshan ho rahaa he dilli se
 Narendra Modi has a rally in Delhi on 29 September and the BJP Minority Front has issued a ten-point guideline to its cadres to mobilize the burqa and topi
 1
 Minority activists have to identify places in Delhi where Muslims reside in large numbers
 vahaan poster or hording ke madhyam se is raily kii charchaa karnaa
 2
 har jile se kam se kam 2000 musalamaanon ko laana sunishchit karen yani ek mandal ek sau muslim log
 3
 kisi se bhi topi yaa burka pahan kar aane kaa aagrah naa karen lekin dadhi rakhane or topi pahanane vaale musalamaanon ko swechha se raily main laane kaa vishesh prayaas karen
 4
 mahangaai or bhrashtachar se pareshaan muslim mahilaon ko khaas taur par raily main shaamil hone ke liye aagrah karen
 5
 pasmanda yani obisi musalamaanon ko raily laane par khaas taur par dhyaan kendrit karen
 6
 raily main jutaney ke liye zyada se zyada madrason, masjidon or dargahon kii intjamiyaan se sampark karnaa
 7
 pasmanda muslim birdari ke pradhanon se baithak kar raily laane ke liye taiyaar karen
 8
 27 sitambar ko dilli kii har masjid main jume kii namaaj ke baad hindi or urdu main taiyaari raily kaa ishtahaar baanten
 9
 raily ko dhyaan main rakhte hue muslim bahul ilaakon main badi-badi baithken karen
 10
 dilli bhar ke musalamaanon khaastaur par obisi muslimon ke bich narendra modi kaa vikaas purush kii chhavi pesh karen
 Assure them that the way Gujarat's Muslim is progressing, after Narendra Modi becomes the PM, every Muslim in the country with equal rights will progress
 bijepi alpsankhyak morcha ke adhyaksh aatif rashid ne bataaya, 'topi or dadhi pahanane vaale musalamaanon ko ham raily main aane ke liye dabaav nahin daalenge, lekin ye request rahegi ki aise log zyada se zyada sankhya main pahunchen kyonki isse kaum kii pahchaan hoti he
 'delhi BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said,' Muslims have progressed in Gujarat, now it is the turn of the country, that's why Muslims will come to Modi ji's rally, wearing caps and burqas, there is little restriction on this, even Muslims It seems that only Modi can get him promoted
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne 25000 musalamaanon ko modi kii raily main laane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 For this, a target of 2000 people has been given to each district
 party kii koshish he ki kam se kam 5 hazaar burka pahanane vaali auraten jarur raily main shaamil ho taaki sandesh saaf jaae ki alpsankhyakon ko ab modi se parhez nahin rahaa
 It is the effort of Delhi BJP that Muslims should not only come to Modi's rally, but it should also be seen that Muslims have come
 ab iskaa makasad kuch bhi ho, lekin bada sawaal ab bhi he ki kya is kavayad se modi musalamaanon ke dil main jagah bana paaenge
 In fact, ever since Modi has become bjp's prime ministerial candidate, efforts have been made to bring the Sardar of Gujarat closer to the minorities
 jaipur kii raily main khaastaur par musalamaanon ko bulaayaa gaya tha to bhopal or dilli raily ke liye bhi aisa intjaam ho rahe hai
 Not only this, BJP is also going to bring a vision document for minorities
 sandesh saaf he
 
 
 Under a scheme, efforts are being made to show minorities with Modi because the question is of Delhi and not only BJP but Modi also knows that Delhi is not Gujarat
 haalanki, bijepi or uski sahyogi aise kisi mishan se saaf inkaar karte hai
 These leaders may say anything but in the recent exercise, Modi's Mission m is clearly visible
 25 taarikh ko bhopal main bijepi kii raily he
 Here too, the minority front has appealed to the Muslims to come in burqa caps
 dilli kii 29 sitambar kii raily ke liye 10 sutreey farmaan jari hua he
 The motive is clear, the Muslims not only reached the rally but also saw their presence in the TV cameras to show the growing acceptance of Modi in Indian politics
 bijepi seenaa taan kar kah sake ki vikaas purush modi se ab kisi ko parhez nahin
 Is Modi not riding two boats? Modi's image is of a hardcore Hindu leader and he never avoids it
 lekin, unki reliyon ko lekar party kii taraf se jo kavayad chal rahi he, kahin aisa to nahin modi do naavon kii sawari kar rahe hai
 The image formed over the years should also be maintained and the disgusted vote bank should also come along
 gujarat ke siem narendra modi siyasat main hokar bhi kabhi duusare netaaon kii tarah nahin hue
 No matter what the pressure, he never compromised his identity
 gujarat dangon ko lekar aalochana hoti rahi
 Critics kept demanding forgiveness but Modi neither apologized nor denied himself being the flag bearer of Hindutva
 - sawaal uthta he virodhiyon kii baari aalochana jhelkar modi ne jo chhavi badi mehnat se gadhi kya wo us chhavi ko todane ja rahe hai?- kya laal kile se jhanda fahraane kaa sapana puraa karne kii khatir adwani ke nakshe-kadam par to nahin chal rahe hai modi?gauratlab he ki bijepi ke piem in vatting rahe adwani ne pakistan main jinna ko secular bataakar apni kattar chhavi sudhaarney kii koshish kii thi
 But, in the case of Modi, the special thing is that till now he has himself avoided making any such statement, whenever he got the chance he did not leave the opportunity to present himself as the poster boy of Hindutva
 ek taraf har maukey par apni hindu rashtravaadi kii chhavi or majboot karne kii koshish, duusari taraf party kii ore se modi kii raily main alpsankhyakon ko jutaney kii kavayad, kahin do naavon kii sawari to nahin kar rahe hai narendra modi?yani, ek taraf apni chhavi ke jariye voton kaa dhruvikaran banaae rakhana or duusari taraf gujarat ke vikaas kii tasviir dikhaakar apane sahyogiyon ke jariye ye sandesh dena ki jab gujarat ke alpsankhyak ko modi se parhez nahin to phir baakiyon ko kyon dikkat ho rahi he? modi kaa mishan saaf he
 To make inroads in every section through the image of development man
 piem banane kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye ye jaruri bhi he

 Modi has given no indication of backing when the BCCI top officials are holding meetings to chalk out a strategy to remove him from the post and has stated his intentions on Twitter
 bisisiai adhyaksh shashaank manohar, upaadhyaksh arun jetali, sachiv en shrinivasana, ipel upaadhyaksh niranjan shah, vitt or media samiti ke adhyaksh rajeev shukla or mukhya prashasnic adhikari ratnakar shetty baithak main maujuud the

 ’’ modi ne apane twitor pej par likhaa he, ‘‘log mujh par istipha dene kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 i can tell you that this will not happen
 chaliye unhen mujhe hataane dijie
 "he said," What we have done in the last four years is in front of everyone

 sanchaalan parishad kii baithak ko ab jab do din kaa samay bachaa he tab donon pakshon ke bich shabdik jang badtar hoti lag rahi he kyonki koi bhi peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Few franchise owners have come out in support of him as Vijay Mallya (royal Challengers Bangalore), Shilpa Shetty (rajasthan Royals) and Jai Mehta (kolkata Knight Riders) when Modi has very few supporters in the fourteen-member Governing Council
 isse pehle bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon ne kai baithak kii jis dauraan atakalein lagi ki modi ko swechha se pad chhodane ke liye manaya ja saktaa he
 But it became clear as the days progressed, these efforts are not going to yield any fruit because Modi is not ready to succumb to the pressure
 isse pehle subah maalya ne kendriya mantri or purv bisisiai adhyaksh sharad pavaar se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii
 Though it was not known what was discussed between the two, Mallya supported Modi
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki modi ko apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 The whole controversy has become an unnecessary storm
 haa, koi saktaa he ki jis tarah ipel ko chalaaya ja rahaa he use lekar kuch sawaal hai
 It is clear that some members of the Governing Council may not be happy
 chaliye isaki uchit jaanch hone den
 "there are unconfirmed reports that Pawar wants the BCCI to give a respectful farewell to Modi, but no BCCI official has confirmed it
" mumbai main kal raat puraskaar samaaroh kaa bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon or sanchaalan parishad ke adhikansh sadasyaan ne bahishkaar kiya jisase bisisiai main modi virdohi rukh saaf ho gaya
 BCCI officials are also planning to boycott the IPL final tomorrow

 kafila aage badha to raste main kai jagahon par kaaryakartaaon ne jhande poster or shaamiyane lagaakar dilli ke mukhyamantri ke swaagat main koi kasar nahin chodi
 By midday, Kejriwal reached Rohtak where he was welcomed by the Aam Admi Party President of Haryana Pradesh, Naveen Jaihind, after bowing in the temple
 rohtak main aap mukhyalay main kejariwal ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue haryana chunaav ke liye taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 Kejriwal exhorted the workers to go door-to-door to strengthen the work of the organization and prepare for the next election as his party has no money

 ab subah main chunaav ladane kaa bigul foonka to 1 saptaah ke bheetar hi kejariwal ko apni janmabhumi kii yaad ai
 Apparently Kejriwal will play his Haryanvi card in Haryana and the party leaders do not deny this
 hariyaanvi hone kaa daanvam aadmi party ke haryana prabharee naveen jaihind kaa kahana he ki kejariwal haryana ke hai or yahi paidaa hue to apane soobe main aakhir kyon chunaav na laden? dilli ke baahar aam aadmi party sirf punjab main pair pasaarne main kaamyaab ho pai
 In such a situation, the benefit of being close to Delhi is visible to the Aam Aadmi Party in Haryana
 shaam hote-hote kejariwal kaa lanbaa chaudaa kafila shivani pahunchaa
 While addressing the activists here too, Kejriwal blew up the fight against corruption in Haryana

 But the sources reveal that in the Lok Sabha elections, the party will try to assess its position on the ground through the vote percentage in Haryana and will contest the assembly elections accordingly
 kyonki chunaav main abhi vakt he, isliye kejariwal ab apni janmabhumi or apni mitti ke mudde par haryana main maujuuda sattadhari dal or vipakshi dalon ke saath duusari sthaneey partiyon ko chunauti dene kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai

 Delhi has got used to changing very fast
 anna andolan se pehle kii dilli or baad kii dilli main voter ke mizaaj main bhi yahi baat saaf jhalkati he
 The Assembly elections held in October 2013 and the subsequent Lok Sabha elections in April 2014 brought such a miraculous change in the mood of the Delhi voters, which has not been seen in Delhi at least for a long time before that
 to kya ab farvari 2015 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main dilli kaa matadaata ek baar phir badi swing legaa yaa voton ke shikhar par baithi bijepi maje main baaji maar le jaaegi
 Beyond electoral claims and accusations, let's look at some figures
 shila dikshit ne 2008 main jab dilli main teesri baar congress kaa paracham fahraaya tha, tab congress ko 40
 31 percent votes were received and BJP 36
 84 fisadi vot mili
 Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party 14 in this election
 5 fisadi vol mili the
 However, the seats in the BSP account were negligible
 lekin anna andolan ke dauraan mathi gai dilli jab oktober 2013 main chunaav main gai to matadaata ne 15 saal se chalaa aa rahaa apana mizaaj ek jatke main badal diya
 There was a sharp 16 per cent drop in Congress vote and 24
 55 fisadi par simat gai
 bjp's seats increased but its vote was reduced to 33 percent
 basapa kaa vot bank puri tarah saaf ho gaya
 And Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party as a new type of revolution of Indian political 29
 49 fisadi voton ke saath duusari badi takat banakar ubhari
 Kejriwal is searching for this election
 lekin chah maheene baad jab dilli main loksabhaa chunaav hue to phijaan ekadam se badal gai
 The BJP achieved a 13 per cent jump in vote share, achieving one of its best performances in Delhi
 modi lahar main party ko 46
 Got 1 percent votes
 aam aadmi party ke vot main teen fisadi kii maamuli badhat hui
 But out of seven seats in Delhi, the Congress, which won seven seats, fell face down and its vote share was 9
 5 fisadi or ghatakar sirf 15 fisadi bachaa
 In two elections, Congress came down to 40 to 15 percent
 basapa phir akhaade main nahin dikhi
 Now after nine months, Delhi is again in the fray
 pichley do chunaav main dilli ne ekadam se ek party par nyochaavar hone kaa trend dikhaaya he
 From the perspective of Lok Sabha elections, there is a big difference of 13% in the vote share of BJP and Aam Aadmi Party
 agar modi lahar pehle se mand bhi ho gai he to bhi kya itnaa voter ek saath party ko chhod degaa
 The Congress has already hit the wall, so the Aam Aadmi Party has no scope for further vote share
 balki ho saktaa he ki ajay maakan main isamen kuch ijapha hi kar len
 But the way the voter has tasted a big swing in the mouth of the two elections, in this case, there will be something swinging this time too
 is swing kii chaudaai par hi dilli ke takhte touse kii takadir nirbhar he
 The way the Modi wave has shown signs of slowing down in Kashmir and Jharkhand and very few people came to the Modi rally on January 10, there is some lesson for Delhi
 aise main jo bhi daanv par laga he, vah bijepi kaa hi he
 BCCI President Sourav Ganguly said on Sunday that a bookie had approached a player during the current Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament, reports Sourav Ganguly The Board's anti-corruption Unit (ACU) has done this

 i was told about it, but i do not know his name
 lekin peshkash kii gai thi or khilaadi ne isaki report kii
 The former captain said that the biggest problem is what the players do after the offer made to the bookie
 unhone kaha, 'peshkash kiya janaa samasya nahin he, yah galat nahin he
 What is wrong is what happens after the offering
 'saurav ganguli se jab tamilnadu premier lig or karnataka premier lig main phixing prakaran ke bare main poocha gaya tab unhone yah khulaasa kiya
 Some players like Indian international player Abhimanyu Mithunibhi Syed Mushtaq Ali are playing in the tournament

 sarkaar haalanki, ucch sadan main vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye bahumat kaa aankada jutaney ke vaaste ji-tod koshish kar rahi he
 While it has received 173 proposals for amendment of the Bill
 vidheyak ko lekar sarkaar or vipaksh aamane-saamne aa chuke hai
 While the government is trying hard to get the bill passed, the opposition has described the bill as 'constitutionally weak'
 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki rajyasabha main subah pesh vidheyak main sanshodhan ke liye 173 prastaav die gaye hai
 Apart from opposition parties, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) have proposed amendments to the bill
 gyaat ho ki rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas bahumat nahin he
 The Trinamool Congress is part of the UPA while the SP and the RJD support the government from outside
 gyaat ho ki 243 sadasyon vaale sadan main congress or uske sahyogiyon kii sankhya 92 he, jabaki vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye sarkaar ko 122 sadasyon kaa samarthan chahie
 The government hopes that the BSP and SP will cooperate in passing the bill
 sadan main vidheyak par tikhi bahes kii shuruyaat hone ke saath hi sarkaar ne bahumat kaa aankada bithaane ke liye baahar bhi prayaas tej kar die
 The Congress Core Committee finalized its strategy in the evening to force sufficient numbers to get the bill passed in its favor
 in atakalon ke bich ki ab vidheyak ko farvari main bajet satr ke dauraan pesh kiya jayega, sansadeey maamalon ke rajya mantri rajeev shukla ne kaha, "ham maanate hai ki rajyasabha main hamaare paas bahumat kaa aankada nahin he lekin ham vidheyak paarit karaane ke liye sarvshereshth koshish kar rahe hai
 " mahatvapurn baat yah he ki sarkaar kii pramukh sahyogi trinmul congress jiske ucch sadan main chah sadsy hai, usne rajyon main lokayukta kii niyukti karne vaale vidheyak ke praavdhaan ko hataae jane kii maang kii he
 This demand has been supported by most regional parties including BJP
 vishwast sutron ne bataaya ki trinmul congress ke sadasyon ne apni maang ko lekar vidheyak main sanshodhan kaa prastaav diya he
 a BJP leader said, "if the Trinamool Congress pressures for its amendments, the government will face difficulties
 " Beginning the discussion, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that the bill is weak but the House should not step back without passing an effective Lokpal Bill
 charchaa ke dauraan jetali ne kaha ki yah vidheyak 'sanvaidhanik tabaahi' laaegaa
 He objected to the provision of minority quota in the Bill and the exclusion of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) from the purview of the Lokpal
 jetali ne sarkaar se kaha ki yadi vah vidheyak ko ucch sadan main paarit karana chaahati he to use bhaajapa ke sanshodhano ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 He said that the provision of the bill which makes it mandatory for the states to appoint Lokayukta on the model of the central government, is not clear and it will affect the rights of the Center and the state
 vahiin, singhvi ne jetali ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya or poocha ki moolbhoot sawaal yah he ki aap lokapal vidheyak paas karwaanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin? While appearing for the government in the House, Singhvi also accused the BJP of not being clear on the issue
 singhvi ne kaha, "bhaajapa najuk sthiti main vidheyak main roda atka rahi he or vah kah rahi he ki vah majboot or samgr vidheyak chaahati he
 She is using this situation as an excuse for not passing the bill
 " The Congress leader said, "CBI is a 70-year-old institution
 kya lokapal ke aa jane se prayek sanstha swat: nasht ho jaaegi?" Singhvi said that the BJP wants to create a giant power of unimaginable proportions, in front of which the Prime Minister's office looks like a 'dwarf'
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) sarkaar ke adheen nahin rahani chahie
 Whereas the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) leader Sitaram Yechury called the bill introduced weak
 vahiin, team anna ke pramukh sadsy or sarvocch nyaayalay ke varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha, "rajyasabha main charchaa ke dauraan maine jo kuch dekha he usase mujhe nahin lagata ki lokapal vidheyak paarit ho paaegaa
 " aaj jab subah ek yatri darshak ne railway time teble kaa screen shot bheja ki amritsar se darbhanga ke bich chalane vaali 15212 jananaayak express 57 ghante let he to yakeen nahin hua
 The train running late for 44 hours was common, but the train must have run for 57 hours, there was no mental preparation to receive this information
 jananaayak express amritsar se darbhanga ke bich chalati he
 All the bogies are general in this, because the laborers of Bihar go to Punjab for wages
 bharat ke mazaduron ke samay kii keemat nahin he
 The Jannayak Express, which opens from Darbhanga, was canceled on Monday
 mangalvaar ko jab chali tab bhi 3 ghante let ho gai he
 In the general bogey which has no facilities
 agar koi 57 ghante let yatra kare to us mazdoor kii aadhi chuttee to isi main chali jaaegi
 He will go home and stay with his family
 hamane 15212 jananaayak express jo amritsar se darbhanga ke bich chalati he uskaa haal dekha he
 Shivank, who is helping us in our work, said that the 15212 number train was delayed for 71 hours on 13 October 2017
 ham kahaan 44 ghante let par gash kha rahe the yahaan to train 71 ghante kii deree se bhi chalane kaa record kaayam kar chuki hai

 From the name it seems that the public is the hero in the Jannayak train, but the condition of the public running in this train is bad
 is train kii khaasiyat yah ki isamen asi nahin he
 Not a sleeper
 general bogi hi he
 At Darbhanga station, our colleague took the situation of Jannayak getting ready for Amritsar
 washing pit par hi log bogi main savaar hone ke liye ja rahe hai
 The endurance of the passengers answers
 seat reserve nahin hone ke kaaran yatri washing pit se hi seat chhenkane ke liye savaar hone lagate hai
 Where there will be cleanliness, if the passengers climb, then obviously the car will not be cleaned
 yatriyon kii sankhya itani he ki kisi ko bharosa nahin he ki pehle seat nahin lee to milegi bhi
 When our colleague Pramod Gupta made this recording, electricity was not turned on at that time, but the fan in the hand of the passengers is telling them how much they trust the electricity
 ek or chiz hamane notice kii he
 There is also a difference of many times between railway website information and railway station information
 pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kam se kam kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train agar samay par chale 57 ghante let na chale to acha rahegaa
 Why did the train with goodsmen run on time? hawaii chappal vaale agar hawaii yatra kar rahe hai to bhartiya rail main koun log safar kar rahe hai
 Bullet train advertisements have started coming in every day
 lekin baaki trainon kii bullate train se kya dushmani he
 Telling the condition of Patna Kota Express

 This train ruined the future of a student
 vah kai dinon se mujhe soochna bhej rahaa tha ki bhartiya rail kii deree ke kaaran vah us pariksha main shaamil nahin ho sakaa jisaki taiyaari vah teen saal se kar rahaa tha
 This student's three-year preparation was ruined
 na jane aise kitne chaatro or logon kaa nuksaan hua hoga
 But think for a minute, three years will have to be prepared and Patna could not take the exam due to not reaching the quota time
 kaayade se railway ko is chaatr ko bulaakar apane yahaan naukari de deni chahie
 patna-kota Express runs from number two
 aaj 12237 number kii patna kota express rhite time khuli he

 The 12591 Gorakhpur Yesvantpur Express was scheduled to leave at 5

00 pm
 abhi yah train yashavantpur nahin pahunchi he or lagbhag 42 ghanta let chal rahi he

45 AM on 5th
 yah train yashavantpur se teen may ko sahi samay raat 11 bajkar 40 minute par khuli thi
 The 12511 Raptisagar Express which runs from Gorakhpur to Thiruvananthapuram was scheduled to leave at 6
35 am on 6 May, but it departed from Gorakhpur on 6 May at 5
45 am, ie 23 hours 30 minutes late

 hamane prime time kii rail series main simanchal express kaa kaaphi zikr kiya jo bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalakar anand vihaar aati he
 Someday this train runs 30 hours late, someday 25 hours delay
 prime time kaa asar yah hua ki swatantraaa senaanee express kii tarah 8 may ko subah apane samay par dilli se nikali
 But by the time they reached Mirzapur in UP, it was three hours and forty minutes late
 11 march 2016 yani do saal pehle rail rajya mantri manoj sinha deree ko lekar rajya sabha main ek likhit bayaan diya tha
 In this statement, he gave many reasons for the delay
 or yah bhi bataaya tha ki deree ko thik karne ke liye kya kya kadam uthaae gaye the
 He had said that the staff associated with the train operation is being encouraged
 time teble main sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Efficiency is being improved through new structures
 railway ne nayaa iti system icmc lagaaya he
 Through this, online monitoring of trains can be done
 trainon ke samay ko lekar vishleshan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All this was done and was being done two years ago
 2016 kaa yah bayaan he
 Why is the same situation in May 2018
 3 may kii pitiai kii khabar he ki railway main let chalane vaali trainon ke pratishat main 5 pratishat kii badhottaree hui he
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to Public Relations Officer Rajesh Vajpayee
 uskaa kuch hissaa aapako dikhaa rahe hai
 Do you want a pension, ask yourself the answer to this question
 rail karmchaaree is sawaal ko lekar sangharsh par utar aae hai
 On 8 May, there have been demonstrations among the railway employees at several railway stations in the country
 nizamuddin railway stesan par rail union ke sadsy dharne par baithe hai
 Ticket cutters, drivers that we call loco pilots, assistant loco pilots, electrical mechanical workers, guards, and staff at the trackman office are also involved in the demonstration
 in sabko kya chahie jo chahie uski baat koi nahin kar rahaa he
 They need an old pension system
 ab in karmchaariyon ko 2004 main lagu new pension skim samaj aane lagi he
 They need pension under the old system
 haal hi main dilli main bhi hazaron kii sankhya main karmchaaree puraani pension vyavastha ko lekar jamaa hue the
 The media and politicians may not talk about the question of pension, but lakhs of employees within government offices are beginning to understand the question of pension
 jo inke sawaal par vaada karegaa wo inkaa netaa ho jayega
 Ask any government employee what he needs on the news channel
 pension par charchaa yaa netaaon ke jhooth or chaalaaki se bhare chunavi bhaashan to sab kahenge ki hamen puraani pension chahie
 The comments yah tasviir darambhaga railway stesan kii he
 Here too the employees are demanding for the old pension system
 rail union ke netaa shiv gopal mishra kaa kahana he ki pension ke alaava railway main do lakh khaali padon ko bharaa janaa chahie
 The government has removed only the vacancy of 9 xxrep 4 0 but two lakh vacancy should be fulfilled
 rail union ne 72 ghante kaa yah kramik pradarshan shuru kiya he
 Shivgopal Mishra claims that sixty to seventy thousand workers are on hunger strike on 8 May
 yah bahut dukhad he ki news channelon par netaaon ke bayanon kaa atikaraman ho gaya he, kabza ho gaya
 There is no discussion of the demand of the public, what is being decided by the leaders is being discussed among the people
 aap ise samajhie varanaa pension kii maang ko lekar media main charchaa ke liye taras rahe sarkari karmchaariyon se puch kar dekhie
 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less
 koi unke sawaal par charchaa kar de
 The public is restless, news channels are following leaders
 ek neshnal silebus ban gaya he desh main, samay-samay par koi na koi aisa topic aa jaataa he jiskaa sambandh hindu muslim dhruvikaran se hota he
 Hate
 baaki aap khud samajhadaar hai
 The time of the workers of India is not worth it
 darbhanga se khulne vaali jananaayak express somvaar ko radd kar di gai
 Even on Tuesday, it has been delayed for 3 hours
 general bogi main jisamen koi suvidha nahin hoti he
 If someone travels 57 hours late, then half the leave of that worker will go in it
 wo ghar jaakar apane parivaar ke saath rahegaa kya, milegaa kya
 We have seen the 15212 Jananayak Express that runs between Amritsar to Darbhanga
 hamaare kaam main madad kar rahe shivank ne bataaya ki 15212 number kii train 13 aktubar 2017 ko 71 ghante let thi

 The train which was supposed to reach Darbhanga at 3 am on the 3 rd arrived at 5 am on the 4th
 26 ghante let
 The 4 date train reached Darbhanga on May 5 with a delay of 33 hours
 -5 taarikh kii train 6 may ko 27 ghanta kii deree se darbhanga pahunchi

 - Two trains a day have reached Darbhanga from Amritsar
 naam se to lagata he ki jananaayak train main janata hi nayak he, magar is train main chalane vaali janata kaa haal bura he
 The specialty of this train is that it does not have AC
 sleeper nahin he
 The general is a bogey
 darbhanga stesan par hamaare sahyogi ne amritsar ke liye taiyaar ho rahi jananaayak kaa haal liya
 People are going to board the bogie at the washing pit itself
 yatriyon kaa dhiraj jawaab detaa he
 Due to the lack of seat reserve, passengers start riding to the seat from the washing pit itself
 jahaan safai hogi vahaan agar yatri chadhenge to zaahir he gaadi kii safai nahin ho paaegi
 The number of passengers is such that no one is confident that if they do not take a seat first, they will also be found
 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta ne jab yah recording kii tab us vakt bijli on nahin hui thi, magar yatriyon ke haath main pankhaa bataa rahaa he ki unhen bijli kaa kitna bharosa he
 One more thing we have noticed
 railway website kii jaankaree or railway stesan kii jaankaree main bhi kai baar antar hota he
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, it would be good if the train carrying at least workers does not run late for 57 hours
 maldaaron vaali train hi kyon samay par chale
 If people with air slippers are traveling by air, then who are traveling in the Indian Railways? aaj-kal bullate train kaa vigyaapan aane laga he
 But what is the enmity of the bullet trains of the rest of the trains
 patna kota express kaa haal bataa rahe hai
 This train was 68 hours late on 29 October 2017
 is train ke kaaran ek chaatr kaa bhavishya barbaad ho gaya
 He had been sending me information for several days that due to the delay of Indian Railways he could not appear in the examination which he had been preparing for three years
 is chaatr kii teen saal kii taiyaari barbaad ho gai
 Don't know how many such students and people would have been hurt
 magar ek minute ke liye thahar kar sochie, teen saal taiyaari kii hogi or patna kota ke samay par na pahunchane ke kaaran pariksha nahin de paaya
 Ideally, the Railways should call this student and give him a job
 patna-kota express do number se chalati he
 Today, the 12237 Patna Kota Express Right Time is open
 rail mantralay ko dekhnaa chahie
 Elections are being held in Karnataka
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gorakhpur se hi hai
 When we saw the condition of trains arriving at Gorakhpur station at 7
26 am, saw the list of trains arriving in the eight-hour range, there were 27 trains, of which the minimum was 23 minutes, 11055 Godan Express and maximum 29 hours 3 minutes
 Late Shaheed Express
 mukhyamantri ko agar chunavi sabhaaon main rail mantri mil jaaen to unase kah sakate hai ki gorakhpur aane jane vaali gadiyon kii haalat kharaab kyon hai
 Not only this, the train going from Gorakhpur to Yeshwantpur station in Bengaluru is running 42 hours late in the election season
 12591 gorakhpur yashavantpur express ko 5 may ko subah 6 bajkar 35 minute par ravaanaa hona tha, lekin yah 31 ghanta 35 minute let hokar 6 may ko gorakhpur se dopaher do bajkar das minute par yashavantpur ke liye ravaanaa hui
 This train has not yet reached Yeshwantpur and is running late for about 42 hours
 15024 yashavantpur-gorakhpur express 5 taarikh ko 7 bajkar 45 minute par pahunchane kii bajaae 6 taarikh ko 11 ghanta kii deree se pahunchi
 The train opened from Yeshwantpur on May 3 at 11:40 AM at the right time
 12511 raptisagar express jo gorakhpur se tiranantpuram tak jaati he, 6 may ko subah 6 bajkar 35 minute par ravaanaa hone vaali thi, lekin yah 7 may ko gorakhpur se chali 6 bajkar paanch minute par, yani 23 ghanta 30 minute let
 12322 Kolkata Mail which runs between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminal to Kolkata, this train was to run from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminal at 9:30 AM on 6th, but it departed late by 9 hours 53 minutes
 ise aath taarikh ko 11 bajkar 45 minute par haavda pahunchnaa tha, lekin antim baar jab check kiya tha tab yah train 15 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 We mentioned the Seemanchal Express in the Prime Time Rail Series, which runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar to Anand Vihar
 kisi din yah train 30 ghante deree se chalati he kisi din 25 ghante kii deree
 The effect of prime time was that, like the Freedom Fighter Express, it left Delhi on May 8 in the morning
 magar upi ke mirzapur pahunchate-pahunchate teen ghante chalis minute der ho hi gai
 On 11 March 2016, ie two years ago, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha gave a written statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding the delay
 is bayaan main unhone deree ke kai kaaran bataaye the
 And also told what steps were taken to fix the delay
 unhone kaha tha ki train oparation se jude staff ko protsaahit kiya ja rahaa he
 The time table is being improved
 nae dhaanchon ke zarie kshamta main sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Railways has installed new IT system icmc
 iske zarie trainon ke samay kii online manitering kii ja sakati he
 An analysis can also be done on the timing of trains
 do saal pehle yah sab kiya ja chukaa tha or kiya ja rahaa tha
 This is a 2016 statement
 2018 may main bhi vahi sthiti kyon he
 On May 3, PTI reported that there has been a 5 percent increase in the percentage of trains running late in the railway
 susheel mahapatra ne jansampark adhikari rajesh vaajapeyi se baatcheet kii he
 You are showing some part of it
 kya aapako pension chahie, is sawaal kaa jawaab khud se puuchhie
 Railway employees have descended on the conflict over this question
 8 may ko desh ke kai railway stesan par rail karmchaariyon main pradarshan kiya he
 Rail union members are sitting on a dharna at Nizamuddin railway station
 tikat kaatane vaale, dryver jise ham loko payalat kehete hai, asistent loko payalat kehete hai, electrical mecanical karmchaaree, guard, trecoman daftar main bhi kaam karne vaale karmchaaree is pradarshan main shaamil hai
 No one is talking about what they all want
 inhen pension kii puraani vyavastha chahie
 Now these employees have started to understand the new pension scheme implemented in 2004
 inhen puraani vyavastha ke tahat pension chahie
 Recently, thousands of employees had gathered in Delhi for the old pension system
 media or netaa bhale pension ke sawaal par baat na karen magar sarkari daftaron ke bheetar lakhon karmchaaree pension ke sawaal ko samajhane lage hai
 Whoever promises on their question will become their leader
 aap kisi sarkari karmchaaree se puuchhie ki use news channel par kya chahie
 Discussion of pension or lies of politicians and cunning election speeches will all say that we need old pension
 tippaniyan This picture is of Darambhaga railway station
 yahaan bhi karmchaaree puraani pension vyavastha ke liye maang kar rahe hai
 Railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra says that in addition to pension, two lakh vacant posts should be filled in the railway
 sarkaar ne sirf 9 xxrep 4 0 kii vaikency nikaali he magar do lakh vaikency puri honi chahie
 The rail union has started this 72-hour serial demonstration
 shivagopal mishra kaa daawa he ki saath se sattar hazaar karmchaaree 8 may ko bhukh hadtaal par baithe hai
 It is very sad that the statements of the leaders on the news channels have been encroached, taken possession
 janata kii maang kii charchaa nahin he, netaa jo tay kar rahe hai usee kii janata ke bich charchaa failaai ja rahi he
 Understand this or else ask the government employees who are yearning for a discussion in the media about the demand for pension
 bank ke karmchaariyon ko 2 pratishat selary badhaane kaa prastaav diya gaya he ve din raat chatapata rahe hai ki unki selary bahut kam he
 Someone discuss their question
 janata baichaiyn gum rahi he, news channel netaaon ke peeche gum rahe hai

 hamane prime time kii rail series main simanchal express kaa kaaphi zikr kiya jo bihar ke arriya zile ke jogbani se chalakar anand vihaar aati he
 Someday this train runs 30 hours late, someday 25 hours delay

 But by the time they reached Mirzapur in UP, it was three hours and forty minutes late
 11 march 2016 yani do saal pehle rail rajya mantri manoj sinha deree ko lekar rajya sabha main ek likhit bayaan diya tha
 In this statement, he gave many reasons for the delay
 or yah bhi bataaya tha ki deree ko thik karne ke liye kya kya kadam uthaae gaye the
 He had said that the staff associated with the train operation is being encouraged
 time teble main sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Efficiency is being improved through new structures
 railway ne nayaa iti system icmc lagaaya he
 Through this, online monitoring of trains can be done
 trainon ke samay ko lekar vishleshan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All this was done and was being done two years ago
 2016 kaa yah bayaan he
 Why is the same situation in May 2018
 3 may kii pitiai kii khabar he ki railway main let chalane vaali trainon ke pratishat main 5 pratishat kii badhottaree hui he
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to Public Relations Officer Rajesh Vajpayee

 Do you want a pension, ask yourself the answer to this question
 rail karmchaaree is sawaal ko lekar sangharsh par utar aae hai
 On 8 May, there have been demonstrations among the railway employees at several railway stations in the country
 nizamuddin railway stesan par rail union ke sadsy dharne par baithe hai
 Ticket cutters, drivers that we call loco pilots, assistant loco pilots, electrical mechanical workers, guards, and staff at the trackman office are also involved in the demonstration
 in sabko kya chahie jo chahie uski baat koi nahin kar rahaa he
 They need an old pension system
 ab in karmchaariyon ko 2004 main lagu new pension skim samaj aane lagi he
 They need pension under the old system
 haal hi main dilli main bhi hazaron kii sankhya main karmchaaree puraani pension vyavastha ko lekar jamaa hue the
 The media and politicians may not talk about the question of pension, but lakhs of employees within government offices are beginning to understand the question of pension
 jo inke sawaal par vaada karegaa wo inkaa netaa ho jayega
 Ask any government employee what he needs on the news channel
 pension par charchaa yaa netaaon ke jhooth or chaalaaki se bhare chunavi bhaashan to sab kahenge ki hamen puraani pension chahie
 The comments yah tasviir darambhaga railway stesan kii he
 Here too the employees are demanding for the old pension system
 rail union ke netaa shiv gopal mishra kaa kahana he ki pension ke alaava railway main do lakh khaali padon ko bharaa janaa chahie
 The government has removed only the vacancy of 9 xxrep 4 0 but two lakh vacancy should be fulfilled
 rail union ne 72 ghante kaa yah kramik pradarshan shuru kiya he
 Shivgopal Mishra claims that sixty to seventy thousand workers are on hunger strike on 8 May
 yah bahut dukhad he ki news channelon par netaaon ke bayanon kaa atikaraman ho gaya he, kabza ho gaya
 There is no discussion of the demand of the public, what is being decided by the leaders is being discussed among the people
 aap ise samajhie varanaa pension kii maang ko lekar media main charchaa ke liye taras rahe sarkari karmchaariyon se puch kar dekhie
 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less

 From the name it seems that the public is the hero in the Jannayak train, but the condition of the public running in this train is bad
 is train kii khaasiyat yah ki isamen asi nahin he
 Not a sleeper
 general bogi hi he
 At Darbhanga station, our colleague took the situation of Jannayak getting ready for Amritsar
 washing pit par hi log bogi main savaar hone ke liye ja rahe hai
 The endurance of the passengers answers
 seat reserve nahin hone ke kaaran yatri washing pit se hi seat chhenkane ke liye savaar hone lagate hai
 Where there will be cleanliness, if the passengers climb, then obviously the car will not be cleaned
 yatriyon kii sankhya itani he ki kisi ko bharosa nahin he ki pehle seat nahin lee to milegi bhi
 When our colleague Pramod Gupta made this recording, electricity was not turned on at that time, but the fan in the hand of the passengers is telling them how much they trust the electricity
 ek or chiz hamane notice kii he
 There is also a difference of many times between railway website information and railway station information
 pradhanmantri khud ko kaamadaar kehete hai to kam se kam kamgaaron ko lekar chalane vaali train agar samay par chale 57 ghante let na chale to acha rahegaa
 Why did the train with goodsmen run on time? hawaii chappal vaale agar hawaii yatra kar rahe hai to bhartiya rail main koun log safar kar rahe hai
 Bullet train advertisements have started coming in every day
 lekin baaki trainon kii bullate train se kya dushmani he
 Telling the condition of Patna Kota Express
 29 aktubar 2017 ke din yah train 68 ghante let thi
 This train ruined the future of a student
 vah kai dinon se mujhe soochna bhej rahaa tha ki bhartiya rail kii deree ke kaaran vah us pariksha main shaamil nahin ho sakaa jisaki taiyaari vah teen saal se kar rahaa tha
 This student's three-year preparation was ruined
 na jane aise kitne chaatro or logon kaa nuksaan hua hoga
 But think for a minute, three years will have to be prepared and Patna could not take the exam due to not reaching the quota time
 kaayade se railway ko is chaatr ko bulaakar apane yahaan naukari de deni chahie
 patna-kota Express runs from number two

 If the Chief Minister finds the Railway Minister in the election meetings, then he can tell them why the condition of trains coming to Gorakhpur is bad

 hamaare sahyogi pramod gupta ne jab yah recording kii tab us vakt bijli on nahin hui thi, magar yatriyon ke haath main pankhaa bataa rahaa he ki unhen bijli kaa kitna bharosa he
 One more thing we have noticed
 railway website kii jaankaree or railway stesan kii jaankaree main bhi kai baar antar hota he
 If the Prime Minister calls himself a Kamdar, it would be good if the train carrying at least workers does not run late for 57 hours
 maldaaron vaali train hi kyon samay par chale

 This train was 68 hours late on 29 October 2017

 Don't know how many such students and people would have been hurt
 magar ek minute ke liye thahar kar sochie, teen saal taiyaari kii hogi or patna kota ke samay par na pahunchane ke kaaran pariksha nahin de paaya
 Ideally, the Railways should call this student and give him a job

 Today, the 12237 Patna Kota Express Right Time is open

 Elections are being held in Karnataka
 upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gorakhpur se hi hai
 When we saw the condition of trains arriving at Gorakhpur station at 7
26 am, saw the list of trains arriving in the eight-hour range, there were 27 trains, of which the minimum was 23 minutes, 11055 Godan Express and maximum 29 hours 3 minutes
 Late Shaheed Express

 We mentioned the Seemanchal Express in the Prime Time Rail Series, which runs from Jogbani in Araria district of Bihar to Anand Vihar
 kisi din yah train 30 ghante deree se chalati he kisi din 25 ghante kii deree
 The effect of prime time was that, like the Freedom Fighter Express, it left Delhi on May 8 in the morning
 magar upi ke mirzapur pahunchate-pahunchate teen ghante chalis minute der ho hi gai
 On 11 March 2016, ie two years ago, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha gave a written statement in the Rajya Sabha regarding the delay

 They need pension under the old system

 The media and politicians may not talk about the question of pension, but lakhs of employees within government offices are beginning to understand the question of pension
 jo inke sawaal par vaada karegaa wo inkaa netaa ho jayega
 Ask any government employee what he needs on the news channel
 pension par charchaa yaa netaaon ke jhooth or chaalaaki se bhare chunavi bhaashan to sab kahenge ki hamen puraani pension chahie
 The comments yah tasviir darambhaga railway stesan kii he
 Here too the employees are demanding for the old pension system

 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less

 The employees of the bank have been proposed to increase their salary by 2 percent
 They are splurging day and night that their salary is very less

 Government lawyer PK Jani made this statement before a division bench of Acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice JB Pardiwala, referring to the letter written by the Commission to the government
 peeth ne ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee kii jisamen yah jaankaree maangi gayi he ki do sadasyeey ayog kii maujuuda sthiti kya he or vah apni antim report kab tak saunp saktaa he
 The court had last week asked the government to find out from the Commission whether it had expanded and when it would submit its report
 sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko apane jawaab main nyaayik ayog dwaara likhit patr pesh kiya jisamen kaha gaya he ki vah apane kaarykaal kii vistaarit avadhi ke samaapt hone tak report jamaa kar saktaa he
 His extended term expires on 31 March 2012

 'mujhe army commander banane se rokane kii sajeesh kii gai
 So that i could not become the army chief later
 ' ye khulaasa kiya he sena ke maujuuda pramukh dalbir singh suhaag ne
 Suhag has accused this former army chief and currently Union Minister of State VK Singh
 suhaag ne supreme court main daayar ek halafname main ye baat kahi he
 This affidavit has been filed in response to the petition challenging Suhag's becoming the army chief
 yachika purvaleftinent janaralaravi dastaane kii he
 Lt Gen Ravi Gowl, now retired, filed a petition against Suhag in 2014
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki may 2012 main suhaag par anushaasanamak roak lagaai gai thi
 Due to this prohibition, he could not become the head of the Eastern Command of the army
 lekin 1 june 2012 ko sena pramukh bane vikram singh ne pakshpaat karte hue ye roak hataa di
 Subsequently, Suhag was made the Army Commander of Eastern India
 pramotion se bane sena pramukharavi dastaane ne aarope lagaaya tha ki isi pramotion kii vajah se dalbir suhaag bhavishya mensena pramukhabanane ke daavedaar ho gaye the
 Since his promotion in 2012 was wrong, he should not be allowed to become the army chief
 haalanki, supreme court ne tab aisa koi bhi aadesh dene se manaa kar diya tha
 This petition has been pending since then
 suhaag par anushaasanamak roak general ve ke singh ke sena pramukh rahete lagaai gai thi
 Jorhat was charged in the action, due to the action taken in December 2011 at Jorhat in Assam by the 3 Corps of the Army
 3 corps ke kai adhikariyon par ek ghar main ghuskar dakaiti kaa aarope laga tha
 At the time of the incident, Dalbir Singh Suhag was the commanding officer of the 3 Corps
 dalbir singh suhaag ne apane halafname main kaha he ki ye baat saaf thi ki unka is ghatana se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 He was on leave at the time of the incident
 iske baavjood achaanak un par anushaasanamak roak laga di gai
 Allegations of conspiracy: Suhag has alleged that a conspiracy was hatched to prevent him from becoming the Army Commander of Eastern India under the guise of this incident
 ye sajeesh khud tatkaaleen sena pramukh wike singh ne rachi
 General Vikram Singh, who became the Chief of Army Staff after him, canceled the action, considering it wrong
 isse pehle june 2014 main daakhil halafname main raksha mantralay ne bhi suhaag ke khilaaf may 2012 main hui karrwai ko 'sajeesh' qaraar diya tha
 Ban on Suhag, however, now VK Singh, who has become a Union Minister, has said on several occasions that if an army contingent commits a crime like robbery, then its chief must be disciplined
 isliye, unhone suhaag par roak laga kar bilkul sahi kiya tha
 However, now everyone will be watching what the court says on this affidavit filed in the Supreme Court

 japan main aae bukampaur sunami ke baad ab uttarakhand ke chamoli main bhi bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gaye hai
 Earthquake intensity on the Richter scale3
 3 maapi gai he
 However, no loss of life or property has been reported
 bukamp kaa jhatka mahasoos karne ke baad log apane-apane gharon se baahar nikal gaye
 Meteorological Director Anand Sharma said that the earthquake struck in some parts of both districts at 2
31 pm
 iskaa centre 30
 5 degrees north and 79
 1 degree purv main tha
 People residing in Chamoli, Gopeshwar, Karnprayag, Rudraprayag and Ukhimath soon moved out of their homes after the earthquake struck
 haalanki, kahin se bhi kisi ke hataahat hone or sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa samachar nahin mila he
 The area suffered a severe earthquake in 1999, in which around 100 people died and hundreds were left homeless
 isse pehle 26 janvari ko haryana-uttarapradesh seemaa par halkaa bukamp aayaa tha jisaki tivrata richter paimaane par 3
 2 was measured
 19 janvari ko bhi dakshin pashchim pakistan main kendrit 7
 There was a 4 magnitude earthquake which was also felt in Delhi, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh and Haryana 
 vahiin 4 farvari ko purvottar ke anek hisson main bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye the jinaki tivrata richter paimaane par 6
 4 was measured
 paanch rajyon ke chunaav kii taarikh ghoshit hone ke saath hi siyaasi sameekaran kii sui 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav kii ore gum gai he
 Politically, these five states are such that the results will be enough to indicate whether the Congress is worth fighting without the allies
 iske saathi hi kshetreey dalon kaa prabhaav tathaa prabhutv main bhaajapa send lagane kii sthiti main he yaa nahin or uttar-purv main bhaajapa apana dabadabaa badhaane kii sthiti main kahaan tak pahunchi he
 In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, there is a direct contest between BJP and Congress
 bhaajapa, madhya pradesh main pichley 15 saal se satta main he
 Amid the anti-incumbency trends gathered in these years, whether the Congress has won the trust of the people, the answer to this question will be found on December 11
 yadi congress 15 saal ke sattavirohi rujhaan ko bhunaane main kaamyaab nahin rahi to phir centre sarkaar ke paanch saal ke satta virdohi rujhaanon se congress ko 2019 main kuch bada hasil hoga yah maananaa mushkil hoga
 If the Congress could win its seat in Rajasthan, then it can say that while the BJP is directly facing the Congress, the people are accepting Congress as an alternative to the BJP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main isse congress ke cader kaa manobal bad saktaa he
 In Chhattisgarh, the decision to contest elections together with BSP and Ajit Jogi will be a triangular contest
 yahaan ke chunaav nattejey yadi congress apane paksh main karne main safal rahi to party yah sandesh dene main safal rahegi ki vah 2019 ke chunaav main bhaajapa virdohi dalon ke liye dhuree banane kii yogyata rakhti he
 If this is not done then the message will be that in 2019, without a grand alliance, Congress may not be able to compete with BJP
 telugana main tiares pramukh or mukhyamantri chandrashekhar raav ne vidhansabha ko samay se lagbhag 8 maheene bhang kar diya
 Whether this was his overconfidence or not would reveal the election results
 yahaan par tidipi ne congress or left party ke saath gathjod kiya he
 The anti-trs camp is alleging that the TRS will go to the bjp's court during the 2019 elections or after the elections
 in aaropon ke baad bhi yadi tiares baaji maarthi he to phir bhaajapa or tiares donon ke siyasat ek duusare ke mufeed he is baat kii charchaa shuru ho sakati he
 If the TRS loses here, then the way to increase the number of UPA partners will be easy
 mizoram main bhaajapa ko yadi makul safalataa milti he to phir 2019 ke liye bhaajapa kaa yah daawa ki loksabhaa chunaav main uttar-purv ke rajyon main party sabhi 25 siten jeetegi, us daawey ko bal milegaa
 But if the BJP does not get success here, then there will be an opportunity for the anti-bjp parties to say that the BJP has started to fall in the north-east
 *** Attacking the Gandhi family to rule the country for many generations, BJP leader LK Advani said that democracy and dynasty cannot coexist
 janchetana yatra ke 22wein din raily ko sambodhit karte hue bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘jis tarah svachh prashasan or bhrashtachar saath-saath nahin chal sakate, usee tarah loktantr or vanshavaad saath-saath nahin rah sakate
 He alleged that the Congress was a family party
