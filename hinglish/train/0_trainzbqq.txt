 Ever since the shooting of the film 'judwaa 2', directed by David Dhawan, has started, there has been a tremendous craze in the film since then
 film 1997 main ai 'judwa' kaa rimek he
 The film had Salman Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Rambha and the film's tremendous comedy and action made it a blockbuster
 'judwa 2' main salmaan kii jagah varun dhawan ne le lee he
 Karisma has been replaced by Jacqueline and Rambha has been replaced by action queen Taapsee Pannu
 jab ek blockbster film kaa rimek ban rahaa he, to tulana hona to laazmi he
 The trailer launch of Judwaa 2, Varun in the comedy but Salman Magic Missinggane's Beats Weak: Three songs of the film so far 'chalti Hai Kya 9 to 12', 'uchchhi Hai Building' and 'ganpati Bappa Morya' have been released
 'chalati he kya 9 se 12', 'oonchi he building' gaanaa 'judwa' main bhi the
 Varun Dhawan has done well in both these songs but the song beats are weaker than the old songs
 haalanki gaanon kii koreography acchhee he
 'chalte hai kya 9 to 12' is choreographed by Ganesh Acharya
 aapako bataa den ki is gane ke original varjan ko bhi ganesh acharya ne hi koreograph kiya tha
 At the same time, 'uchi Hai Hai Building' has been choreographed by Bosco

 raja kaa dost rangila ne tutalaate hue logon kaa khub manoranjan kiya tha
 Shakti Kapoor is missing in 'judwaa 2' and seeing the trailer, she seems to have been replaced by Rajpal Yadav
 lekin unka koi damdaar role najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Miss Match of Heroines: Jacqueline and Tapsee's dancing steps are good but Jacqueline and Tapsee are not fitting in instead of Karisma and Rambha
 karishma kii sharaarat jacleen main dikhnaa mushkil he or taapasi ko ection chhod alag avatar main pachaana bhi hamaare liye mushkil hoga
 Varun Dhawan's 'october' actress's name revealed, see PHOTOS Well, it won't be right to say anything more about the film from the trailer and songs
 film 29 sitambar ko relies hone vaali he or use dekhakar hi kaha ja saktaa he ki varun dhawan, salmaan khan kii yaad dilaane main safal hote hai yaa nahin

 Asked if such statements are being made against the party chief despite sp's support to the UPA, Yadav said, "he does not deserve to be given any importance
" ‚Äôunhone kaha ki agar koi ‚Äòpagal‚Äô ho jaae to use ilaaj ke liye bheja janaa chahie
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav refused to comment on the issue and said he would not comment on such things
 alvi ne buudhvaar ko sapa pramukh ko bhaajapa kaa ‚Äòsabase bada agent‚Äô kah vivaad paidaa kar diya tha
 However, the Congress quickly distanced itself from Alvi's statement
 party ke mahasachiv jarnadan dvivedi ne kaha, ‚Äòparty isse sahamat nahin he
 The Congress has always been in favor of uniting all secular forces
 ‚Äô The Modi government has made it clear that foreign portfolio investors (fpis) will not be relieved from surcharge on income of super rich people
 in niveshkon ne trust yaa association of persons ke rup main gaiyr corporate ikai ke rup main nivesh kiya he, isliye ve corporate tex ke nahin balki inakam tex ke daayre main aaenge
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had increased the tax on such super rich people in the budget

 88 se badhkar 39 fisadi or 5 karod rupee se adhik kii aamadani par 35
 Increased 42 from 88

 What are FPI Foreign Portfolio Investors (fpis) are investors who invest in Indian shares, bonds or other instruments
 unke paas yah vikalp hota he ki yaa to vah corporate ke rup main nivesh karen yaa gaiyr corporate ikai ke rup main
 About 40 per cent of fpis have invested as fpis in the form of Trusts or Associations of Persons, ie non-corporate units
 tex ke lihaaj se in icaayiyon ko vyakti ke rup main hi dekhte hai
 According to the Business Standard, this will benefit the government by about Rs 400 crore, the super rich surcharge can benefit the government from a total of Rs 12 to 13 thousand crore

 But a senior central government official said, "there is no question of removing it
" ham kisi bhi varg ko nishaanaa nahin bana rahe
 The government wants to increase its revenue and no more tax burden can be imposed on the corporate, because they are already taxed more
 'gauratlab he ki bajet main vitt mantri ne 400 karod rupee tak ke turnover vaali companiyon ke liye corporate kar 25 fisadi kar diya he, jabaki pehle sirf 250 karod tak kii companiyon ko is daayre main rakhaa gaya tha
 Due to this, the government will incur a tax loss of about Rs 3,000 crore annually

 The condition of the farmers in our country has been considered very pathetic and that is why there is no income tax on the farmers, that is, the income from agriculture in our country is exempt from tax
 lekin jaraa dekhie desh kii rajdhani main kisaanon ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 In Azadpur, the biggest mandi of the country, farmers get commission from the farmers in exchange for selling their produce, which is called aadhat
 aadhat yani aadhati kaa vah kamishan, jo usko kisaan or kharidaar kaa sauda karwaane ke evaj main miltaa he
 Although the commission is not charged anywhere from the farmer in the whole country, but till some time ago, up to six percent commission from farmers was valid in Azadpur Mandi and other mandis of Delhi
 dilli hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad yah tay hua ki dilli main bhi ab kisaanon se koi kamishan nahin liya jayega
 The commission can only be charged from buyers, that too up to six per cent
 dilli ke bakhtawarpur gaanv ke kisaan raajapaal ne bataaya ki vah mandi main aadhati ko chah fisadi aadhat dene ko majaboor hai
 Rajpal said that he is aware that the lawful commission can be taken only from the buyer, yet he is compelled to pay commission to the agent
 agar vah aadhati kaa virodh karenge, to aadhati kah degaa ki aap apana maal mere yahaan se uthaao or kahin or bech lo
 All agents are charged commission only
 yadi bechney main zyada der hui, to subjiyon ke kharaab hone kaa bhi dar rahata he
 To protect the interests of farmers, there is a Mandi committee i
e
 APMC
 apiemasi sadsy bijendra tyaagi kehete hai ki unhone khud is bare main samiti main shikaayat kii he, lekin afasar karrwai karne ko taiyaar hi nahin hai
 Tyagi explains that what is happening in the market is known to everyone, but still everything continues
 apiemasi ke sadsy rajendra sharma ke mutabik kisaanon se avaidh aadhat vasuuli subjiyon main chah fisadi tak he, jabaki falon main yah 12 fisadi tak he
 Illegal recovery is being done from the farmers, as well as tax is also being collected from the buyer in the name of octroi without any education, which is called octroi
 rajendra sharma ke mutabik kul milakar salanaa kareeb 1,000 karod rupee kaa bhrashtachar akele ajadpur mandi main ho rahaa he
 The APMC does occasionally take some action to show off, but the government has no intention of stopping this corruption
 ullekhneey he ki is saal farvari main jab achhatiyon par kisaan kii bajaay kharidaar se kamishan vasuulne kaa dabaav bana, to achhatiyon ne mandi main hadtaal kar di thi
 The government had announced to impose a stock limit on potato and onion, which is unknown even after a month
 sarkaar ne haal hi main apiemasi kanoon main badlaav kar fal‚àísabji ko di‚àílist karne ke baat kahi thi, lekin achhatiyon ke dabaav main mandiyaan puraane dharre par chal rahi hai
 It is being said that the work will go on in the old mandis, and new mandis will be made, so that the farmers can sell their goods in the mandi without the role of a broker and reduce inflation
 jane kab mandi banegi, kahaan banegi, koun banayega, koun chalaaegaa
 
 
 It is ironic that we call farmers farmers
 jai jawan, jai kisaan kaa naaraa lagaate hai, chunaavon main kisaanon se khub lubhaavne vaade karte hai, lekin haalat yah he ki kisaan apni upaj bechney ke liye bhi kamishan de rahaa he

 Former cricket captains Kapil Dev and Mohammad Azharuddin supported the BCCI to form the National Sports Federation under the RTI Act
 iskaa prastaav rashtriya khel vikaas vidheyak main rakhaa gaya he
 The bill will be discussed in the cabinet today
 vahaan se manjuuri milane ke baad ise sansad ke maujuuda monsoon satr main hi pesh kiye jane kii ummid he
 Autonomous institutions like the BCCI and the Olympic Association of India have opposed the bill
 kapil ne haalanki kaha ki bisisiai ko kanoon todane ke bare main nahin sochna chaiye
 The captain, who won India's first World Cup, said in a seminar organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry, "if the government makes any rules, the BCCI should follow the guidelines
" bisisiai swytt rup se bhi kaam kar sakati he lekin sarkaar ke disha nirdeshon kii upeksha karke nahin
 At the same time, Congress MP from Moradabad Azhar said that the BCCI should not be given concession in the rules
 unhone sansad se baahar patrakaron se kaha, yah vidheyak khel icaayiyon ke liye acchhee baat he 
 It should be for all sports federations and no one should get any concession
 ‚Äô vahiin bisisiai is vidheyak ke daayre main aane ke liye abhi bhi taiyaar nahin he
 BCCI Vice President Rajiv Shukla said, i have not yet seen the Bill
 pehle mujhe masauda dekhnaa hoga
 How can it come under RTI when we do not take any grant from the government
 purv cricketer ajay jadeja ne kaha ki bisisiai ko is vidheyak kaa virodh nahin karnaa chaiye
 He said, BCCI has done a great job, but when the government makes a law, it does not look at a particular institution because the game is one
 yadi aisa koi vidheyak aata he to sari khel icaayiyon ko apane daayre main letaa he to isamen koi buraai nahin he
 Jadeja said, what does BCCI need to worry about
 sarkaar usase yah nahin kah rahi he ki khel ko badhaava mat do yaa apana tarika badal do
 She is not stopping him from doing anything
 vah bas itnaa chaahati he ki yah adhik paardarshee tareeke se ho
 Kapil also said, even though i had differences with the BCCI, but the BCCI has done a great job as a unit while other sports federations have not been able to do so
 sabhi ko bisisiai se prerana leni chaiye
 'the government believes that the bill will bring accountability to the National Sports Federations
 maakan ne kal kaha tha, hamen khelon main sudhaar kii jarurat he jo yah vidheyak laayegaa
 If it is approved by the Cabinet, it will go to Parliament and i am sure it will be passed unanimously in Parliament
 ‚Äô unhone kaha tha ki sansad se manjuuri milane par vidheyak ke tahat sabhi mahasanghon ke liye kaaryakari board main 25 pratishat khilaadiyon ko rakhana anivaary hoga
 bcci's Governing Council member and BJP MP Anurag Thakur termed the bill as an intervention of the government in the functioning of sports units
 unhone kaha, is vidheyak kii kya jarurat he
 Does the government want to control all sports units? sarkaar ko chaiye ki buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar karne par dhyaan de
 They do not have enough money to promote sports in the country
 ‚Äôunhone sansad ke baahar patrakaron se kaha, sarkaar aise kanoon laakar khel icaayiyon par niyantran banane kii koshish main hai
 No sports federation would welcome it
 ‚Äô is vidheyak ke tahat mahasang main 70 varsh se adhik umr kaa koi vyakti mahasang yaa ioe kaa padaadhikari nahin ban saktaa 
 With this, the presidents of the federations cannot hold more than three terms of 12 years or four years each
 anya padaadhikari lagaataar do baar pad par nahin rah sakate lekin ve chaar saal ke brake ke baad phir chune ja sakate hai
 Azhar supported it saying that it was a good thing
 kaarykaal pratispardhi hona chaiye
 If there is no improvement in three years, it cannot happen in 30 years
 kapil ne kaha ki khel mahasanghon ko bisisiai se sabak lenaa chaiye ki sanghathan kaa sanchaalan kaise kiya jaataa he
 He said that instead of criticizing cricket, other sports federations can learn from the BCCI how the game is marketed

 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main shatrughna sinha ne saaf kaha ki piem ke best candidet adwani hai
 He did not just challenge Narendra Modi
 balki bijepi ke kai or netaaon ke saath bhi score saital kiye
 All this happened till today through the words spoken in the course of his special conversation with correspondent Ashok Singhal
 pehle to ham samajhen ki shatrughna pairvi kiski kar rahe hai
 Adjectives are being blown for Advani
 unhen ghaney badalon ke bich raushnee or god fadar figure of politics kaha gaya
 Shatma Swaraj is cute
 is list main yashavanth sinha, jaswant singh ke alaava do nae naam bhi jude hai, calraj mishra or shanta kumaar
 This Kalraj Mishra was the President of BJP in UP in the nineties, became the Minister of Supply of Power and is currently an MLA from Lucknow
 shanta kumaar bhi 1991 main himachal pradesh ke siem rahe, magar uske baad se vahaan dhumal ne hi satta or sanghathan par pakad rakhi he
 Shanta's name had also risen to the post as seniority in the post-gadarki Crisis scene
 in netaaon ke aashirwad or sahyog ko shatrughna ne jaruri bataaya
 So what did the satire come on, Rajnath Singh shatrughna kaa jawaab dekhie
 'I have a very good friendship with Rajnath Singh, our president is Rajnath Dabangg
 guni kaddavar aadmi hai wo
 'now after this compliment, he said that Rajnath should respect the party's will and the country's will
 or bakaul shatrughna ye ichha he ki adwani ji jo sabase yogya hai, unhen aage rakhaa jaae
 In the son's marriage, the father remembered Shastrughan Sinha, who Advani has done
 modi kii tarif kii
 But the last one added the tail of Shivraj
 lokapriyata kii baat ai to narendra modi ko unke gujarat tourism ke ambesder actor amitabh bachchan se bhi neeche gira diya
 Said that if it is about popularity, then Amitabh Bachchan is the most popular and i want him to be made President of India
 modi kii fajihat yaheen nahin rukii
 Shatrughan also said that this is the era of BJP
 main bas itnaa chahta hum ki bete kii shaadi ho to maa baap ko na bhuulaa jaae
 Advani will be the best PM Shatrughan, while turning around Advani's question, just said repeatedly that Advani is the best in BJP, whether in terms of politics or experience and organization
 unhen kaha ki meri raay he ki adwani hi sabase behatar piem ho sakate hai
 Then raising the question mark, the enemy said why Advani cannot be PM
 koun he unase behatar
 In this sequence, he also mentioned the age of Manmohan
 baat saaf thi ki agar wo ho sakate hai to ye kyon nahin
 The enemy again reiterated that in our eyes, there can be no better than Advani, the leaders of Bihar also dealt with the old jumla
 kaha lollypop raajnneeti main yakeen nahin
 Then came the attack on the leaders of Bihar
 rajeev pratap rudi
 Bihar man of Team Modi
 inke liye shot gan jo bole, use gaur se padhein
 i love Rudy ji very much
 smart hai
 Are dashing
 political hai
 Now see if it is a compliment or a compliment! Then came the turn of another Bihari leader
 naam shahanvaj hossain
 Shatrughan said for him that Shahnawaz achieved a lot of success at an early age
 lafjon par pakad jabardast he unki or rajnatik samaj bhi khub he unhen
 The lion also heard a lot, the silent man Neshtru made it clear to read the lion on three occasions
 bihar bijepi main jo un par karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 He spoke for them
 unka kaam he ahale siyasat wo hi jaane
 My message is as far as love is concerned
 phir adwani kaa naam japane ko modi virodh maane jane par shatru or khule or bole ki agar sach kahana baghawat he, to samajho main baagi hum
 On the question of Yashwant Sinha going towards Modi camp, the enemy said that you told the non-residents, you heard from the non-residents, some would have told us, some would have heard from us

 But Yogi Adityanath also screwed it up and told him that Suheldev's candidate would contest the bjp's election mark on one of the seats
 baliya main rajbhar ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki vah bahut gusse main the, isliye ravivaar tadake teen baje mukhyamantri adityanath ke awaas par pahunch gaye
 He told, 'the Chief Minister was sleeping, the officers stationed there asked me to come in the morning
 subah maine kai baar mukhyamantri se sampark karne kii koshish kii, lekin unase koi sampark nahin ho paaya
 With this, he said, 'I tried to convince everyone including Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath that we are allies
 agar ham ek yaa do siton par bhi chunaav nahin ladenge to hamaare voters ko kya bataaenge? lekin ve mujhase bhaajapa ke chunaav nishaan par ladane ke liye kehete rahe

 Giving information to this effect, Bihar Chief Electoral Officer Ajay v Nayak said that the nomination papers of eight of the 104 candidates who filed nominations for this by-election were canceled for various reasons while two candidates withdrew their names

 In this by-election, there will be triangular clashes between JDU, RJD and Congress alliance, NDA constituents BJP, Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party as well as CPI, CPM and CPM (male) in Left parties
 party or sahyogi dalon ke badhate paare ke bich narendra modi kii mushkilen unke mantri bhi badha rahe hai
 After Amit Shah, Maya Kodnani and Purushottam Solanki, the crime of Modi's minister Babu Bhai Bokhiria is a reflection of Modi's honesty
 chunavi baitarani main bijepi ke khewanhaar bane modi kii khud kii naav ko jor kaa jhatka laga he
 In Gujarat, Modi's senior minister Babubhai Bokhiria has been sentenced to three years
 porbandar kii adaalat ne babu bhai ko jis maamle main sajaa sunai he wo 6 saal purana he or ye cese 54 karod ke avaidh chuunaa pathar khanan ke maamle se judaa hua he
 Porbandar's court has given seven days to Babu Bhai
 yani saat dinon tak unki giraftaar nahin hogi or ve chahen to is dauraan upree adaalat main jamaanat kii arji daal sakate hai
 When will Babu Bhai Bokhiria resign, but the question arises what Modi will do to Babu Bhai
 babu bhai kah rahe hai ki party jo bhi faisla legi, ve maanenge
 But on the pretext of Babu Bhai, Modi has come under attack from the Congress
 gujarat congress ne 54 karod rupe ke avaidh chuunaa pathar khanan maamle main porbandar kii ek adaalat se cabinet mantri babu bokhiria ko teen saal kii sajaa milane ke baad unke istife kii maang kii
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, 'the court has convicted Babubhai Bokhiriya in the illegal mining case
 lekin hamaare congress ke doston ko is bare main tippaniyan karne se pehle jaan lenaa chahie ki unheen kii party ke purv saansad bharatbhai odedara ko bhi isi maamle main doshi bataaya gaya he
 'but he said that justifying both of them as guilty does not mean that illegal mining is right, but it does indicate that the Congress should also see its face in the mirror before attempting to corner the BJP
 modi sarkaar ke ek or mantri par laga daagdarasal, modi sarkaar main babu bhai chauthe mantri hai, jinpar daag laga he
 Babu Bhai was also arrested in 2007 for illegal mining, but was released after spending a few days in jail
 vidhansabha chunaav main babu bhai ne congress ke diggaj netaa arjuna modhwadiya ko bade antar se haraaya to modi ne unhen cabinet mantri bana diya
 Earlier, Amit Shah was arrested by the CBI in the Sohrabuddin encounter case
 haalanki supreme court se mili raahat ke baad ve pehle kii tarah modi ke daahine haath bane hue hai
 Similarly, Maya Kodnani has been sentenced to life imprisonment in Naroda Patia murder case and is in jail
 modi ke ek or mantri purushottam solanki par chaar sau karod ke bhrashtachar kaa maamla he or khud hai court ne unke khilaaf jaanch kaa aadesh diya he
 It is evident that Modi's ministers are becoming slippery in the path of Modi, moving towards Delhi

 Regarding the Citizenship Amendment Bill, he said, 'this bill is not in favor of the people of Sikkim, it is related to the people of bangladesh-afghanistan-pakistan
 ham bangladesh se jude hue hai, abhi bengal or north east ke kuch rajyon ke saath bhi kuch mudde chal rahe hai
 In such a situation, Sikkim is also affected by this bill
 mujhe ummid he ki sikkim kii rajya sarkaar is bill kaa virodh karegi‚Äô
 Former Indian captain said that we have Article 371 (F) in Sikkim, we have our own Sikkim Subject Act

 He said that the present issue is not just foreigners, but also those who are outside Sikkim

 Baichung Bhutia's Hamro Sikkim Party will strongly oppose the Citizenship Amendment Bill and will write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah on this issue
 bhutia ne kaha ki ham sikkim main citijan bill ko sweekaar nahin karenge, iske badale ham chahenge ki sikkim subject aaidentification ko lagu karwaanaa chahenge
 Significantly, the citizenship amendment bill has got approval from the Modi cabinet, soon it will be introduced in Parliament to pass this bill

 Describing any assurance by SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath as fabricated, Ram Gopal said, "mulayam Singh did not say that Samajwadi Party will support the Lokpal Bill"
 yah puri tarah se galat he
 Asked if SP will continue to disrupt the proceedings of the House on this issue and will not allow the Bill to be passed, he said, "I can only say that we will oppose it and will not support it
" ramgopal ne kaha ki sapa ne rajyasabha ke sabhapati ko bhi koi aashwaasan nahin diya he ki jab vidheyak laayaa jayega, tab vah sadan main koi vyavdhaan nahin daalegi
 He said, the chairman has not been given any assurance
 agar jarurat padi, to ham sadan ke kaamkaaj main baadha daalenge
 The SP chief is understood to have expressed objection to the government regarding the Lokpal Bill and said that the proposed bill would give unprecedented powers to this institution and would make it difficult for officials to work
 sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav kaa maananaa he ki bhrashtachar se muqabla karne ke liye vartmaan kanoon ko hi majboot karne kii jarurat he
 At the same time, Anna Hazare, who is fasting at Ralegan Siddhi, has made it clear that till the bill is passed, he will not end his fast

 Anna said, i have read the provisions of the Bill properly
 yadi aapako (kejariwal ko) lagata he ki vidheyak main kuch kamiyaan hai, to uske liye anshan kiijie
 Hazare said that many of his expectations from the bill have been fulfilled and he is satisfied with the bill that has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 lokapal vidheyak par jhukne kii khabar ko managasaint bataate hue samaajawaadee party ne somvaar ko kaha ki jab is vidheyak ko mangalvaar ko rajyasabha main laayaa jayega, tab vah iskaa virodh karegi

 Even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed displeasure over the Batakand of Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Akash Vijayvargiya, it seems that the Madhya Pradesh BJP leader is not ready to take a lesson from it
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey ne indore main nagar nigam ke ek adhikari ko bat se peeta tha, jiskaa video bhi saamne aayaa tha
 Expressing strong displeasure over the incident, PM Modi said that this type of incident will not be tolerated
 betaa kisi kaa bhi ho bakhsha nahin jayega
 PM Modi even said that those who have welcomed Akash Vijayvargiya should be expelled from the party
 haalanki piem modi kii in baton kaa asar madhya pradesh vidhansabha ke netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav par nahin hua
 This is the reason that when Akash Vijayvargiya reached the Vidhan Sabha for the first time after the controversy erupted in Indore, the Leader of Opposition read the praises of Akash
 netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne akaash vijayawargeey se milane ke baad kaha, 'pichley kuch dinon main logon ne sachin tendulkar se zyada akaash kii charchaa kii he
 When it was 10-12 days after the incident, the sky first appeared, then i told him that your name is so much that it is not as much as Tendulkar's
 mujhe kya maaloom tha ki yah sab karne se aisa hoga
 All this is a joke, which is called Jugalbaji

 The Congress said that Tendulkar was insulted

 unhone kaha ki aise main akaash se tulana karnaa mahaan khilaadi sachin tendulkar kaa apmaan he
 At the same time, Commercial Tax Minister Brijendra Singh Rathore said that it is very surprising that the party which calls itself a big disciplinarian
 jo party apane pradhanmantri ke upar hi vot maangati he
 The Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi, expresses displeasure over the conduct of the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA and openly says that the son should belong to anyone
 aise ladakon ko sadan main rahane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 On the other hand, if on the other hand, their leader, the opposition or others, patting the back of Akash Vijayvargiya and saying that your discussion is more than Sachin Tendulkar, then it is showing the difference between bjp's words and actions

 In Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray met Sharad Pawar at a five-star hotel
 shaam saadhe saat baje ensipi netaa ajit pavaar kaa bayaan aayaa ki ham congress ke samarthan kii chitthee kaa intjaar kar rahe hai or jab tak congress kii chitthee nahin aati ham intjaar karenge
 If we need to give a letter of support to the Governor, we will give it together
 logon ko laga ki congress chitthee dene main deree kar rahi he magar yah sharad pavaar or sonia gandhi kii baatcheet main tay ho gaya tha ki ham jaldbaaji main samarthan kii chitthee nahin dene vaale hai
 This was another Chanakya policy of Sharad Pawar
 udhar shiv sena bina samarthan kii chitthee ke rajyapal ke paas pahunchi or use 24 ghante ke andar bahumat sabit karne ke liye kaha gaya
 Now again Sharad Pawar approached Sonia Gandhi and started persuading her that we should support the Shiv Sena and join the government
 sonia gandhi pehle haa karne se kataraa rahi thim magar jab yah sawaal aayaa ki congress ke liye bijepi badi dushman he yaa shiv sena? to sonia gandhi sochane par majaboor ho gayi
 Maharashtra's Congress leaders present in Delhi were constantly pressurizing Sonia to agree to support the Shiv Sena
 inhen congressi netaaon ne jaipur main maujuud congress vidhayakon kii raay bhi sonia gandhi ko bataai or kuch vidhayakon se baat bhi karai
 Sharad Pawar explained to Sonia Gandhi that if the NCP and Congress support the Shiv Sena and join the government, the government will be able to run for five years
 aakhirkaar sonia gandhi maan gayi or pavaar se kaha ki ve teen netaaon ko mumbai bhej raheen hai
 The three leaders who went to Mumbai included Ahmed Patel, one of the most trusted and political advisors of Sonia Gandhi and the current Congress treasurer, Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress in-charge of Maharashtra and KC Venugopal, close to Rahul
 ye teenon netaa mangalvaar kii subah jane vaale the magar khabar ai ki ve nahin ja rahe hai
 
 
 The phone line opened again between 10 Janpath and Sharad Pawar
 aakhikar dopaher baad ye teenon netaa mumbai pahunche or sharad pavaar se mili
 But by then the NCP asked for more time from the Governor, which the Governor refused
 idhar dilli main dopaher main hi pradhanmantri ne brazil jane ke pehle cabinet kii baithak bulaakar maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan par muhar laga di
 Just waiting for the President who was in Punjab at that time
 shaam hote-hote unki muhar bhi lag gai
 Soon after, Ahmed Patel and Sharad Pawar held a joint press conference in Mumbai and criticized President's rule in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki rajyapal ko congress ko bhi mauka dena chahie tha
 He said on forming the government that the leaders of Congress and NCP will sit together and decide what to do next and later Shiv Sena will be made aware of it
 yani pavaar ne sara 'power' apane haath main hi rakh liya or shivasena ab aise doraahe par khadi he jahaan unki naiya ensipi or congress kii patavaaron ke bina kinare tak nahin pahunch sakati he

 On the occasion of the 73rd Independence Day of the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hoisted the tricolor on the ramparts of the Red Fort and surrounded the opposition parties to protest the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir while addressing the country
 piem ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane ke liye koi prakhar to koi mook rup se samarthan detaa rahaa he
 But those who are advocating this, the country is asking that it was so important, so why not make it permanent
 piem modi ne kaha ki raajnneetik galiyaaron main, chunaav ke taraazoo se taulne vaale kuch log, 370 ke paksh main kuch na kuch bolte rahete hai
 The country is asking 370 advocates that if this article was so important, then why did you not make it permanent even after having such an overwhelming majority for 70 years
 asthaayee kyon banaae rakhaa
 He would come forward and make it permanent
 aap bhi jaanate the, yah jo hua he, sahi nahin hua he
 But you did not have the courage to improve
 mere liye desh kaa bhavishya sabakuch he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that we neither avoid problems, nor do we avoid problems
 na samasyaon ko paalane or na taalane kaa vakt he
 The work which was not done in 70 years, was done within 70 days of the formation of the new government
 sansad ke donon sadanon ne 2 tihaai bahumat se isko paarit kar diya
 He said that there was this thing in everyone's heart, but who should start, who will come next, perhaps that was waiting for him
 isliye deshavaasiyon ne mujhe yah kaam diya
 You came to do the work that you gave
 meraa apana kuch nahin he
 The Prime Minister said that due to Article 370, the people of the valley were not getting the benefit of many facilities, where corruption, separatism had set their feet
 piem modi ne kaha ki daliton, gurjar samet anya logon ko adhikaar nahin mil paa rahe the jo ab unhen milane vaale hai
 The PM said that removal of Articles 370 and 35A from Jammu and Kashmir within 10 weeks is a step towards realizing the dreams of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 dilli vidhansabha main janalokapal bill pesh karne vaali aam aadmi party apane hi puraane saathiyon ke nishane par aa gai
 Seeing the attack from all four sides, the party reached the shelter of Anna Hazare
 kumaar vishwaas or sanjay singh anna se milane unke gaanv ralegan siddhi pahunche
 After meeting Anna, Kumar Vishwas said that we have given Anna ji's suggestions to the government
 jaanch kaa suzav bhi hamane maan liya he, jisamen centre ke vibhaag main jaanch vaali baat bhi thi
 Vishwas said that Prashant ji himself also said that 15 drafts were made
 bill jab rakhe jate hai to sanshodhan hote hai
 Attacking Prashant Bhushan, who opposed the bill, Vishwas said that even after Ramlila Maidan, the bill changed but it is not right to call the fellow disgusted
 prashanth ne bill par kejariwal ko bahes kii khuli chunauti di thi
 Reacting to this, he said that there should definitely be a debate but in the debate it should not happen that Raghav is bad-tempered and Ashish is the watchman

 After this, the lion starts having fun with both dogs

 Petrol pumps are one such place
 india today jaanch team ne petrol pampon se hi jude sambhavit ghotaale ko benakaab kiya he
 The strings of this scandal are widely spread in the country
 bataa den ki haal main special task force ne uttar pradesh main sandigdh petrol pampon par chaape maare the
 Now the India Today investigation has confirmed those doubts as to how you run the risk of being cheated while fueling petrol pumps
 india today team ne jaanch ke tahat sabase pehle mitti ke bartanon ke liye mashhoor uttar pradesh ke khurja shahar main sthit uttam seva philing stesan kaa rukh kiya
 It is one of the busiest petrol pumps located on Bulandshahar Highway
 uttam seva philing stesan parpetrolturane vaale karmchaaree chaman ko india today ke under cover reporters ne khud kaa parichay petrol pump kharidne ke icchhuk logon ke taur par diya
 Chaman, who has a thorough knowledge of the types of tactics used on petrol pumps, also openly told India Today's Under Cover Reporters some 'tricks of trade'
 chaman ne kaha, 'dekho bhai, ye sab ek chip ko isamen (dispencer) set karne kii baat he
 If you have a strong grip (on the system) then you can reduce the amount of fuel after consulting with the engineer
 sirf ejeeniyar hi ise feet kar saktaa he
 Whichever set you want - 50 grams, 40 grams - the chip fits accordingly
 'chaman remote control sanchalit chip kii baat kar rahaa tha jise petrol bharne vaali mashiinon main chupa kar feet kiya ja saktaa he
 This small chip replaces the original gadget of the machine so that it can be disturbed while filling petrol
 is chip ke madhyam se meter kii speed tej kar di jaati he lekin graahak ko uske chukaaye paison ke badale kameendhanmiltaa he
 If it is said in Khanty language, it is called 'beating the stick'
 chaman ne bataaya, 'vahaan ek remote control hota he
 The chip is switched off if an inspection ever occurs
 ye thik vaise hi kaam karata he jaise ki car ko remote se lock kiya jaataa he
 When the chip is switched off, the machine starts pumping full amount of fuel
 ' chaman ne ye bhi kabool kiya ki uske kaarysthal par bhi ek mashin main isi tarah chhedchhad kii gai he
 That was not enough, Chaman revealed another trick to India Today's Under Cover Reporters
 jis pipe se petrol vaahan main daalaa jaataa he usne uski tonti ko hanger par deele dhang se tonga
 This did not make the machine readings zero again
 ab idhan lene ke liye line main jo aglaa graahak laga he, use bhugtan kiye paise ke mukaable kam eendhan milane kaa khatra rahata he
 Provided that the customer has not kept a watchful eye on the meter before filling the petrol
 hathras ke madhav philing stesan ke manager keshav singh ne under cover repotars ke saamne khulaasa kiya ki kis tarah naap taul vibhaag ke adhikariyon se mileebhagat kar dhokhadhadi ko anjaam diya jaataa he
 Keshav Singh said, 'the day these machines are stamped for installation, then they are tampered with
 bas tabhi naap taul vibhaag ke karmchaaree ko meter fiks karne ke liye kaha jaataa he
 'keshav Singh further said,' You can tell him that 30 grams (ml) should be avoided for us in 5 liters
 aap jaisaa chaahate hai, wo usee hisaab se dispencer ko set kar degaa
 'what Keshav Singh said was not being said merely by giving advice to the under cover reporters
 keshav singh ne apane petrol pump par bhi ye sabhi hatkande apana rakhe the
 The reporter asked how much tampering was done with your machine
 is par keshav singh kaa jawaab tha- ‚Äò20 mili, 25 mili (prati litre)
 'keshav Singh said,' Machines should not be tampered with where fewer customers come
 agar chhedchhad kii gai mashin inspection main pakadi bhi jaati he to bhi mere paas do mashine sahi se chalati rahengi
 Kartar Singh, assistant (attendant) at Malik Filling Station in Noida, admitted that the machines on this petrol pump were set in such a way that 5 ml less fuel was released on every liter
 kartaar singh ne kaha, ‚Äòsab kuch kiya jaataa he
 Nobody knows anything
 5 millilitre (prati litre) hota hi kitna he lekin vyapak taur par dekha jaae to isse bahut fark padataa he
 According to Kartar Singh, molestation is done by professional people who are called fitters
 agra main india today kii team ek aise petrol pump par pahunchi jis par kuch maheene pehle hi chapa padaa tha
 An attendant named Bhikam Khan has been working at Agra's City Friend Filling Station for more than a decade and a half
 jaanchakartaaon ko abhi nirnaayak report deni he lekin khan ne india today kii team ke saamne kai khulaase kiye
 The reporter asked what is installed in the machines
 khan ne is par bataaya, ‚Äòye eendhan kii delivery kam kar detaa he
 Every 5 liters that we sell is reduced by 100‚Äì150 ml
 hamaari sabhi mashiinon se samjhauta (chhedchhad) kii gai he
 Officials do not understand this
 lekin unke apane andeh the isliye ek dispencer se kuch aprits apane saath le gaye
 'fuel demand in India grew at the fastest pace in 16 years in 2016
 aankade bataate hai ki beete saal desh main har din 25 karod litre dijal or 7
 50 million liters of petrol consumed
 agar jaisaa ki andeh he, ghotaalaa itnaa hi vyapak he to eendhan ko bharwane main kam delivery rashtriya arthvyavastha ko kitna nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he, samajha ja saktaa he
 And how much fraudsters are filling their pockets with illegal profits

 When asked about the news of Shourie advocating FDI and increase in diesel prices, BJP spokesperson Tarun Vijay said, "on December 16, 2002, Congress had declared FDI in multi-brand retail in the Lok Sabha as anti-national
" tab tatkaaleen vaanijya mantri arun shouri ne sakht jawaab diya tha or kaha tha ki bahubrands khudara kshetra main epadiai ko nahin laayaa jayega
 ' idhar, shouri epadiai ko lekar die gaye apane bayaan se palatate bhi najar aae jab unhone kaha ki bahubrands khudara main videshi pratyaksh nivesh par unki tippanee ko galat tarah se pesh kiya gaya he
 He, however, persisted in calling the decision to increase diesel prices a good step

 The then Commerce Minister Arun Shourie had given a stern response, saying that FDI would not be brought into the multi-brand retail sector
 ‚Äô On the other hand, Shourie was also seen to backtrack from his statement about FDI when he said that his comment on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail has been misrepresented
 haalanki dijal ke daam badhaane ke faisle ko acha kadam bataane ke rukh par vah kaayam rahe
 The comments bhaajapa ne shouri ke bayaan se ittefaq nahin jataayaa lekin sweekaar kiya ki vah ab bhi party ke sadsy hai

 ‚Äô The Shiv Sena, a partner of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Center, has demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban the burqa and mask in the national interest
 shivasena ne yah maang tab kii he jab pradhanmantri modi ayodhya main raily karne vaale hai
 The Shiv Sena has demanded that the burqa be banned in the country in view of the serial blast in Sri Lanka on the occasion of Easter
 shivasena ne centre sarkaar kii tripal talaak mudde par tarif kii lekin yah bhi apil kii ki burke or nakaab par bain lagaae jaaen
 BJP has opposed this demand of Shiv Sena
 srilanka visphot ke baad hui maut ke aakande ko badhaakar bataate hue shivasena ne kaha ki islamic aatankwaad kii vajah se srilanka main 400 logon kii bali chadh gai
 Sri Lanka recovered from LTTE terrorism and Islamic terrorism prevailed
 saath hi shivasena ne srilanka ke saath bharat ke aadhyatmik rishte kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 At the same time, BJP has objected to the demand for banning the Shiv Sena burqa
 bijepi netaa or pravaktaa jiviel narsimha ne is maang kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki bharat main burke par bain kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The Shiv Sena has written in its mouthpiece Saamana, 'the current government has stopped the exploitation of victimized Muslim women by enacting a law against' triple talaq '
 yah sweekaar he lekin bheeshan bam visphot ke baad srilanka main burka or nakaab sahit cheharaa dhankanevaali har cheez par pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 We are welcoming this decision and Prime Minister Modi, while following the footsteps of the President of Sri Lanka, should also ban 'burka' and 'nakab' in India, making such demands for the national interest
 france main bhi aatankwaadi hamalaa hote hi vahaan kii sarkaar ne burka par bain lagaaya

 phir is bare main hindustan peeche kyon?'shivasena ne srilanka ke raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena ke us faisle kii tarif kii jisamen unhone nakaab or burke par pratibandh lagaaya he
 Questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena said when the burqa was banned in Ravana's Lanka, when will it happen in Ram's Ayodhya? turkistan islamic raashtra he lekin kamaal pasha ko jab andeh hua ki burke kii aad main kuch ho rahaa he to usne apane desh main muslim yuvakon kii dadhi or burke par pratibandh laga diya
 Originally, the burqa does not even have any relation with Islam and the Muslims of India are following the system of Arab nation
 'vahiin kendriya mantri ramdaas athavle ne kaha he ki shivasena kii yah maang galat he
 Not every burqa-wearing woman is a terrorist
 yah unki paaramparik poshaak he
 They are entitled to wear it

 The burqa should not be banned in India

 We filed a PIL for ban on gutkha in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka last year
 lekin dilli kaa nateeja in rajyon se pehle mil gaya
 He, however, regretted that Delhi had taken the decision to ban gutkha too late
 11 rajyon main gutkha pratibandhit ho chukaa he
 While the country's capital should have taken this step first and set an example

 The Delhi government, while giving preference to health over revenue, announced a ban on all gutkha products in the capital
 pratibandh ke antargat in utpaadon kii bikri, nirmaan, vitaran, parivahan, pradarshan or bhandaaran par purna roak rahegi
 Gutkha can be seized if found selling
 uski bikri karne vaali dukaan kaa license, gutkha nirmaataa kaa utpaadan license bhi radd kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the transporter will also be fined for transporting it in Delhi area
 dow chaturvedi ne kaha, ‚Äòkeval pratibandh lagane se hi kaam nahin chalegaa
 Today, despite smoking bans, people still openly smoke cigarettes
 pratibandh ko sahi tareeke se lagu kiya janaa chahie or isamen media or samaaj kaa sahyog bhi bahut jaruri he
 Devika Chaddha, program director of the Salam Bombay Foundation, an NGO that is campaigning for a ban on gutkha, said, "children under 10 years of age also eat gutkha
 khaas baat yah he ki gutkhe ke naam se lekar puraa prachaar bacchon ko lakshya kar kiya jaataa he
 Initially, the children eat passionately and later become addicted to it
 yah slo poijan dhire-dhire unke swasthya par pratikul asar daalane lagata he
 Devika said, "the health of children is given priority in the constitution as well and that's why we started demanding a ban on gutkha
 tambaakoo unki sehat par vipareet prabhaav daalate hai
 It has been banned in 11 states including Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Maharashtra, Kerala, Rajasthan

 He said that the betel nut (ereca nut), which has been called a carcinogen by the Cancer Research Unit of the World Health Organization, is the main ingredient of gutkha and pan masala
 isamen milaai jane vaali paan kii pattiyon or anya samagriyon se bhi cancer hone kii ashanka hoti he
 The accumulation of toxic and metallic elements found in gutkha is like a slow poison that can be fatal

 Use of a small portion of betel leaf can also be harmful for pregnant women

 Historians have also come forward in this case after the attack of Karni Sena on the set of Padmavati, a film by noted film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali in Jaipur
 varisht itihaaskaar irfan habib ne daawa kiya he ki jis padmavati ke apmaan ko mudda banaakar karani sena or duusare sanghathan hangaamaa machaa rahe hai, vaisaa koi kairactor asaliyat main tha hi nahin, kyonki padmavati puri tarah se ek kaalpanik charitra he
 Irrfan Habib said that the famous writer Malik Mohammad Jaisi had played the role of Nepadmavati
 ye ek kaalpanik kirdaar he
 Jayasi had written a very famous novel based on this
 habib ne kaha ki padmavati kaa itihaas main 1540 se pehle koi record nahin miltaa
 This character was composed in 1540
 kisi bhi itihaaskaar ne 1540 se pehle iskaa ullekh nahin kiya
 These things are completely imaginary
 habib ne kaha ki jaaysi ne rajasthan ko aadhaar banaakar ekaromantic upanyasalikha kyonki rajasthan ek romantic jagah thi
 According to his circumstances, Padmavati's character fit, so he introduced it by making it real
 lekin uske aadhaar par itihaas main koi badlaav karnaa mushkil he
 Actually, Karani is upset with the love scene being filmed between Rajput queen Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in the Rajput Sena film, but history tells a different story according to which Khilji was born when Malik Mohammad Jaisi composed Padmavat
 1540 main padmavat kii rachana hui
 Raja Ratan Singh, Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmini are just the characters of Padmavat

 '' dilli main jam laganaa aam baat he, or har aam aadmi ise apni niyati samajhakar jhelta he
 You too bear this jam, and i too
 yah hamaari or aapaki routine kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 The government, the system, the desire to buy people's cars and whoever curses them, are stuck in their heart and heart
 khaskar, jo log ashram chowk kaa jam rose jhelte he, badi chaalaaki se barapula kii taraf bhaagate hai, or jab vahaan bhi funs jate hai, unase mujhe badi sahanubhuti hoti he, kyonki rose - somvaar se shuukravaar - ham bhi kisi gaadi main sir pakade kisi na kisi ko koste aapaki bagal vaali gaadi main hi hote hai, or yah kisi ke liye bhi nayaa nahin he
 The jam began to coalesce ever since it shifted to Mayur Vihar
 pehle nizamuddin kaa pul do len kaa tha, usamen aadhe ghante se zyada fanse rahete the
 Then another flyover began to take place in the ashram, and the jam remained in life
 phir ek or fliover, yani jivan kaa hissaa ban gaya yah jam
 The daughter grew up, the hair started to whiten, the position increased, but it has clung to life like a fucking jam leech
 pehle dendi bana to laga, chalo ganga naha liye, lekin ganga hi itani maili he ki jam se mukti kahaan dilaa paati
 Jam is very common for us, but imagine if a particular person encounters a jam
 
 
 ji haa, aaj aisa hi kuch desh ke parivahan mantri ke saath ho gaya
 
 
 Nitin Gadkari was coming from the airport towards Parliament House while going to office
 sansad kaa satr chal rahaa he, so, mantri ji kaa rahanaa jaruri tha, lekin jam to jam he
 
 
 What was common and what was special, stuck with work
 phir kya tha, mantri ji ko saamne dhaula kuan kaa metro stesan dikh gaya
 He immediately told the staff, leave the car, go by metro
 phir kahin jaakar vah sansad bhawan pahunche
 When Gadkari came out of the Rajya Sabha, people asked about the experience of the jam
 mantri ji ne fouran dilli main jam kam karne ke liye 4,700 karod dekar ek or ring road banane kaa elaan kiya or yah bhi kaha ki agar dilli sarkaar yah nahin kar sakati to unka mantralay iske liye pahal karegaa
 We asked the engaged hand, Sir, when will the Mukti get rid of the Ashram, then the Minister said, he knows this, and the new Ring Road will also get relief from the Ashram Jam
 is ring road ke liye tender isi maheene jari honge
 Well, when this ring road will be built, then it will be built - when the extension of Barapula will be built, and the extension of the metro will also have to wait
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki abhi tak maine metro tri kyon nahi kiya
 
 
 Of course, brother, whenever i go to Parliament, i hold the metro, the mall in Noida also goes by metro
 magar jis tarah har marz kaa ek hi ilaaj nahin hota, vaise hi metro bhi har jam kaa ilaaj nahin he
 i am waiting for another metro extension to go to office, or to have six coaches in Badarpur line
 tab tak har shaam daftar se nikalate vakt google map par trephic kii laal line dekhakar, andaja lagaakar nikalataa hum ki ashram se luun, yaa barapula se, yaa mathura road hote hue pragati maidan hokar nizamuddin kaa pul pakaduun, yaa pragati maidan hote hue dendi jaaun
 'happy jamming' until you get rid of this jam
 
 
 khoda bif, nikali seat
 
 
 Yes, Beef No seat was the reason behind Junaid's murder in Ballabhgarh
 railway police ne junayd murder cese main mukhya aaropee ko dhar dabocha he
 On questioning him, he has revealed the murder to be done for the seat
 junayd murder cese main police ne jo theory bataai, wo us raajnneetik bhuuchaal se alag he, jisko lekar siyaasi rotiyaan senki gai
 Confession of the main accused - On June 22, i was returning as a guard in the National Museum
 shivaji brij par mathura shatal ke ek dibbe main savaar tha
 - Three to four Muslim boys were in the same compartment
 train okhla railway stesan par rukii, to ek adhed umr kaa shaks savaar hua
 - He asked Muslim boys for seats, but they did not rise
 is par gussaye shaks ne unako mullah kahkar thappad maar diya
 After this, Muslim boys also became angry and started fighting
 ise dekhar mujhe or kuch yatriyon ko gussa aa gaya
 - Me and the middle man together with some passengers beat them badly
 unhen dharm se judaa apshabd bhi kaha tha
 - Those boys moved to another compartment at Tughlakabad station
 lekin ballabhagarh stesan par saat-aath or ladke aa gaye
 - They came into the box in us and started quarreling with the middle man
 donon ore se ladaai ke saath apshabd kahe jaan lage
 - In this case, a boy identified me
 mujhe belt se maarane lage
 My head was cracked
 khun dekhakar main baukhala gaya
 - i told them don't come near me, i will stab you
 maine un par hamalaa bol diya
 He spoke derogatory words about religion
 - train jaise hi asaavati stesan par pahunchi, main utar kar baahar bhaaga
 He took a lift from his bike to Jataula, his maternal uncle's village
 - jataula gaanv ke jahand ke paas maine chaaku chipa diya
 Nobody knows about it
 main hathiyaar baraamad kara saktaa hum
 - i can also identify and apprehend those who beat up Muslim boys
 railway police kii theory- dilli se mathura ja rahi train main seat ko lekar jhagada hua
 Communal remarks occurred during the quarrel, but the quarrel had nothing to do with beef
 - junayd par chaaku chalaane vaala vaardaat ke baad maharashtra ke dhule jile pahunch gaya
 - In Sakri area of dhule district, the accused started a new job
 - aaropee dilli ke ek company main security guard kii naukari karata he
 - Knife accused is not known before the rest of the 5 accused
 - vaardaat ke din aaropee dilli ke shivaji brij stesan se chadha
 Joined the quarreling people
 - aaropee ko dabochne ke liye police ne us root par active mobile data ko monitor kiya
 - a number of active numbers were found to be closed
 isse police ko aaropee kii shinaakht karne main madad mili
 Unrecovered arms: Railway police is yet to recover the weapons involved in the incident, but the main accused was arrested in Dhule, Maharashtra and on the basis of his interrogation, police claim that Junaid was not killed on suspicion of eating beef
 haalanki, junayd kaa parivaar police ke is daawey ko sahi nahin maanata he
 Their demand is different
 siyaasi jamaat ko sabakchalati train main jo kuch bhi hua wo bheedtantr ke kanoon haath main lene kaa nateeja lag rahaa he
 Junaid's father wants his son's killer to be hanged
 police jaanch aage badhaaegi, kanoon apana kaam karegaa, adaalat insaaf karegi
 But when will that political class learn? isane pehle din se is ghatana ko bif vivaad kaa rang dekar apana phayda nikaalnaa chaha

 Taking a dig at the UPA government over FDI and corruption in the retail sector, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will bring a no-confidence motion against the government in the winter session of Parliament
 sansad kaa satr guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahaa he
 Meanwhile, BJP leader Murali Manohar Joshi said that Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has called Sushma Swaraj, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha and asked her party to support the no-confidence motion being brought against the UPA government
 haalanki joshi ne is prastaav ke asafal rahane ke baad ke ghatnakramon ke bare main kayaas lagane se parhez kiya
 Asked whether the decision of the Trinamool Congress to bring a no-confidence motion in the Parliament against the UPA government which supports SP and BSP is justified? Joshi said in response, opposing FDI is an appropriate step, but if the Trinamool brings a no-confidence motion, it has to be prepared for its effects
 unhone chetavanee di, trinmul ke paas paryaapt sankhya nahin he or vah anya dalon ke samarthan par nirbhar he
 Despite this, if the leadership of the Trinamool leads on this path, it will have to be prepared for the possible effects
 apni tippanee kaa matlab samajhaate hue joshi ne kaha ki agar sankhya puri nahin he or prastaav asafal ho jaataa he to sarkaar agle chah maah ke liye surakshit ho jaaegi or is dauraan phir avishvaas prastaav nahin laayaa ja sakegaa
 On the other hand, if the resolution is passed and the government falls, you will still have to think ahead
 joshi ne kaha ki ek baar sushamaa swaraj bal thakare ke antim sanskaar ke baad mumbai se dilli waapas aa jaaen to rajg netritv is maamle par baat karegaa 
 Meanwhile, there is some good news for Mamta
 bhakpa ke netaa gurudas dasgupta ne kaha ki unki party kisi bhi dal dwaara laae jane vaale avishvaas prastaav kaa samarthan karegi
 He also said that Trinamool would need the support of 50 mps to bring a no-confidence motion
 dasgupta ne kaha, agar sansad main avishvaas prastaav aata he to ham sarkaar ko bachaane kii jimmedaari nahin lenge
 We will not walk out, we will vote against the government
 aashaa ke anuroop congress ne trinmul ke is kadam kii aalochana kii he
 Akhil Bharatiya Congress Committee spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed told reporters in Ranchi that the decision was a sign of the Trinamool Congress approaching the BJP
 unhone kaha ki yah prastaav sarkaar ko milane vaale 305 saansadon ke samarthan ke saamne aundhe munh giregaa
 The comments ahamed ne kaha, mahaj 19 sadasyon vaali party trinmul congress kii ore se avishvaas prastaav laane kaa nirnay dikhaata he ki party naa sirf bhaajapa balki makapa ke bhi nikat ja rahi he, lekin vah 305 saansadon ke saamne maat khaaegi

 unhone is ghoshnaa ke ek sakaaratmak pahalu ko dikhaate hue kaha, mamata kii ghoshnaa kaa sakaaratmak bhaag he ki vah phir kabhi yah nahin kah paaengi ki congress apratyaksh taur par makapa ke saath he
 West Bengal Congress Committee President Pradeep Bhattacharya told reporters that the move has exposed the lack of 'experience and principles in the field of politics' in Mamata Banerjee
 unhone kaha, mamata bahut acchhee tarah jaanati hai ki vah is prastaav ko akele nahin laa saktin
 Therefore, he relies on communal forces, BJP and anti-marxists
 yah sirf anubhav or raajnneeti ke kshetra main siddhanton kii kami he

 yah sirf anubhav or raajnneeti ke kshetra main siddhanton kii kami he
 However, Joshi avoided speculating about the developments following the failure of the proposal
 poochne par ki kya sapa or basapa kaa samarthan paane vaali samprag sarkaar ke khilaaf sansad main avishvaas prasatav laane kaa trinmul congress kaa nirnay uchit he? joshi ne jawaab main kaha, epadiai kaa virodh karnaa uchit kadam he, lekin agar trinmul avishvaas prastaav laati he to use uske prabhaavon ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 He warned, the Trinamool does not have sufficient numbers and is dependent on the support of other parties
 iske baavjood agar trinmul kaa netritv is raah par aage badhata he to use sambhavit prabhaavon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Explaining the meaning of his remarks, Joshi said that if the number is not complete and the proposal is unsuccessful, the government will be safe for the next six months and no confidence motion can be brought again during this period
 unhone kaha, duusari ore agar prastaav paarit ho jaataa he or sarkaar gir jaati he to bhi aapako aage ke bare main sochna hoga
 Joshi said that once Sushma Swaraj returns from Mumbai to Delhi after the funeral of Bal Thackeray, the NDA leadership will discuss the matter
 is bich mamata ke liye kuch acchhee khabar bhi he
 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said that his party would support the no-confidence motion brought by any party
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki trinmul ko avishvaas prastaav laane ke liye 50 saansadon kaa samarthan chahie hoga
 Dasgupta said, "if the motion of no confidence comes in the Parliament then we will not take the responsibility of saving the government
" ham walk out nahin karenge, ham sarkaar ke khilaaf vot denge
 As expected, the Congress has criticized Trinamool's move
 akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne ranchi main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki yah nirnay trinmul congress ke bhaajapa ke nikat aane kaa sanket he
 He said that this proposal would fall in front of the support of 305 mps who had received the government
 tippaniyan Ahmed's decision to bring a no-confidence motion by the Trinamool Congress, a party of just 19, shows that the party is not only approaching the BJP but also the CPI-M, but will be defeated in front of 305 mps
 hamen 305 saansadon kaa samarthan praapt he
 Showing a positive aspect of this announcement, she said, "there is a positive part of Mamata's announcement that she will never be able to say that the Congress is indirectly with the CPI (M)

 She said, Mamta knows very well that she cannot bring this proposal alone
 isliye vah sampradayik takaton, bhaajapa or dhur virdohi marxvaadiyon par nirbhar hai
 It is simply a lack of experience and principles in the field of politics
