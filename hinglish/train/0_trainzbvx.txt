 congress bhi dhire-dhire gaay kii sharan main utarati ja rahi he
 In Chhattisgarh, Congress has brought out quick service vehicles for cows
 iske jariye biimaar or ghayal gaay ko swasthya sevaayen muhaiyaa karai jaaengi
 Till now, the BJP had a political monopoly on the cow, but now the Congress has also come into the fray
 congress kii daleel he ki gaayon ko lekar bijepi sirf raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Whereas the Congress man has been a Gopalak from the beginning
 tark he ki nehru ji jamaane main bail jodi congress kaa chunaav chinh tha
 While the cow calf during Indira Gandhi's tenure
 gauratlab he ki rajya main varsh 2018 main vidhaan sabha chunaav hone hai
 Therefore, this cow service ride of the Congress can prove to be a means of getting votes from the common people besides the real cow servants
 chhattisgarh main congress gaay kii sharan main chali gai he
 Till now, BJP had a political stake in cow protection
 lekin san 2018 main hone vaale vidhaan sabha chunaav ke maddenjar ab congress bhi gaay ke laalan-paalan main jute gai he
 Gau Mata is now shouting at the Chhattisgarh Congress headquarters
 party kii daleel he ki bijepi gaayon ke naam par sirf raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Many bjp-backed activists are committing violence in the name of gau seva
 congress kaa yah bhi aarope he ki bijepi ke kai kaaryakarta gau sangrakshan ke naam par logon ko maut ke ghat utaar rahe hai
 According to him, during the tenure of Prime Minister Modi, India has become the second largest country in the world after Brazil in beef export business

 According to the party, Congressmen have a sense of pity for cattle, especially cow
 jabaki bijepi ise lekar sirf hinsa par utaaru he
 Till now he had a monopoly in cow protection
 raajnneetik maidan main dur-dur tak is mudde kii aguwai uske alaava or kisi raajnneetik dal ne nahin kii thi
 But now the Congress has come out on the streets to give it a hit
 party ne garmjoshi ke saath cou ambulance ko baqayada hari jhandi dikhaa kar sadakon par utaara he
 The BJP is surprised by this cow love of the Congress
 haalanki party kii daleel he ki congress ko bhi gaayon ke saath aana padaa
 It is clear that the Congress is following the BJP to come to power
 jabaki bijepi gaay ko lekar raajnneeti nahin karti he
 There is less than a year left for the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh
 lihaaja bijepi or congress donon hi partiyaan kisi bhi mudde se bekhbar nahin rahanaa chaahatin
 The Congress feels that the case of cow protection has also filled the bjp's bag with votes
 jabaki gaayon ke sangrakshan ke liye koi thos prayaas nahin ho rahe hai
 Therefore, the party has fielded its workers
 saal 2016 ke nobel prise kii ghoshnaa shuru ho gai he
 In this sequence, the Nobel Prizes of Physics (physics) have also been declared

 Nearly five lakh coal industry workers have been on a five-day strike since Tuesday

 75 percent of the country's coal production came to a standstill due to the workers' strike
 isse kol india bhi prabhavit hui he or bijli sanyantron ko eendhan aapurti par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 This means that a major power crisis may arise in front of the country

 -input bhashaa se Punjab cabinet minister Rana Gurjit caught in the controversy over the auction of sand mines is the target of the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party ne rana gurjeet ke istife kii maang ko lekar puure punjab main pradarshan karne kaa elaan kiya he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Sukhpal Khaira, who is accused of suppressing farmers' money, is making new revelations every day about Congress government minister Rana Gurjit
 taaja maamle main sukhpal khera ne rana gurjeet par uttar pradesh main unki sugar mills main kisaanon kaa paisa dabaane or 200 karod ke difolter hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 In support of the minister, the farmers 'organizations of UP alleged that Torana Gurjit, many farmers' farmers from Uttar Pradesh's Bajpur reached Chandigarh and raised slogans against Sukhpal Khaira
 in kisaanon ne kaha ki rana gurjeet ne kisi bhi kisaan kaa koi paisa nahin dabaaya he or sirf 52 karod kii rakam hi un par kisaanon ko dene ke liye bakaayaa he
 Slogans against the AAP Farmers of Bazbajpur gave their statements in favor of Rana Gurjeet at a press conference at Chandigarh Press Club and raised slogans against Aam Aadmi Party's Punjab leader Sukhpal Khaira
 vahiin sukhpal khera ne in sab kisaanon ko rana gurjeet kaa bhaade kaa bataaya or kaha ki difolter to difolter hota he
 Whether he is a defaulter of 52 crores or 200 crores, but it happens to be a defaulter and Rana Gurjit is a defaulter of Bajpur in UP
 soshal media diggaj fasebuk ne photo aadhaarit ap launch kiya he
 Even before this, Facebook has launched many apps, but not many of them were successful
 haalat yah he ki inamen se kuch ko company ne ab band karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Facebook has named this photo sharing app Kalful Balloon
 new york times kii ek report ke mutabik ise sirf china ke liye launch kiya gaya he
 According to a BBC report, Facebook is working with the Chinese app developer Yug Internet Technology for this
 report ke mutabik febsuk ke ek pratinidhi ne kaha he ki china main fasebuk kii dilchaspee he or china main samay vyateet karke use alag alag tareeke samajhane kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Let us know that Facebook's photo-based app Moments already exists
 isamen photo album store karne kii suvidha he or isse fasebuk shering bhi aasaan hoti he
 The most important thing is that it has been launched secretly in China, because it has to undergo many regulations in China
 isliye abhi tak fasebuk kii taraf se koi bhi aadhikarik bayaan nahin aayaa he
 Facebook wants to expand its services rapidly in China, but this is not possible due to the rules there
 bharat ke baad china fasebuk ke liye sambhavit bada bazaar he, lekin2009 main china ne ise bain kar diya
 Subsequently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has continuously worked to fix it
 china ke sarkari aalaa afasaron se milakar vahaan apni services shuru karne kii baatcheet bhi kar rahe hai
 This app is being tested and it is evident that the company is busy with life to start its service there once again
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani kaa yah kahana sahi he ki kendriya vidyalayon main teesri bhashaa ke rup main german kii padhai tribhaasha formule kaa ulanghan he or isiilie unhone german hataa kar isaki jagah sanskrit ko laane kaa faisalaa kiya he
 But in doing so, she forgot that even Sanskrit did not match the spirit of the trilingual formula
 tribhaasha formule kaa maqasad bharat kii bhashik vividhta or alag−alag bhashabhashi samudaayon kaa sammaan tha
 Under this, all people had to study a third language besides English and Hindi
 pashchim bengal ke log isi ke tahat bangla padhate hai, maharashtra ke log marathi, gujarat ke log gujarati or dakshin bhartiya log dakshin bharat kii alag−alag bhashaaen
 This language policy had the facility in front of the large Hindi belt of India that it would have chosen a language in the remaining Indian languages
 agar hindibhashi skulon main tamil, telugu, marathi, bangla, oriya yaa duusari bhartiya bhashaaen sikhaane kaa intazaam hota to baaqi ilaaqon se is hindi pattee kaa rishta kahin zyada apnaape se bharaa hota
 In other areas also, the Hindi opposition slowed down
 lekin hindi waalon ne sanskrit padhane kaa faisalaa kiya jo desh ke kisi hisse main nahin boli jaati
 He did not even choose Urdu, without which Hindi cannot stand
 yah ek aisi beyimaani thi jisane desh kii bhashik ekta main ek badi daraar paidaa kii
 That is not to say that Sanskrit should not be taught
 lekin sanskrit kaa adhyayan ek shastreey bhashaa ke taur par hona chahie jaise paali kaa hota he yaa praakrit yaa aditamil kaa ho saktaa he
 Sanskrit is undoubtedly at the root of many Indian languages, but to call it the mother of Indian languages is to actually cut many links between the relationships
 sanskrit hamaari ek puraani puvarja he, jisaki smriti hamen samrudh karti hai, lekin use bilkul kareeb laane kii−bhashaa main jabaran shaamil karne kii koshish− bhartiya bhashaaon ke sanyukt parivaar kii rishtedaariyaan gadabada detii he
 But who should give this fine understanding of language and culture to those who have a very shallow understanding of culture and nationalism, and who present it very aggressively
 unhen bas raajnneeti karnaa aata he or aisa karte hue ve german ko bhi paraayaa bana daalati hai or sanskrit kii bhi sahaj sweekaaryata ko grahan lagaati hai
 German and Sanskrit are languages of the same family
 ek daur main sanskrit kii bahut sari thati ko sahejane main german vidwaanon ne bhi kaaphi kaam kiya he
 The work of Max Müller for Indian languages is historical, but governments cannot make this a teaching weapon in central schools as a weapon of their politics
 ve sanskrit or samskruti donon se prem karne kii baat kahati hai, lekin darasal shatruta nibhaati hai

 iske liye ve doston, senior students ke paas jate hai yaa phir bazaar main khojbin karte hai

 The app provides educational materials such as engineering, medical, arts, management, law, commerce, CA and CS subjects notes, syllabi, question papers, case studies and projects
 notsgen ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari or sansthaapak maanak gulati kaa kahana he, 'notsgen kaa idia ek vidhyaarthee ke rup main mere nijee anubhav or hamaare saathi samooh ke bich nots khojane or use seekhney main aane vaali kathinaayee se upja
 The launch of notesgen has received great response and the app is the next step in the development of this platform, delivering educational materials to students in as many ways as possible, even on their favorite devices

 varsh 2014 ke chunaav ko lekar bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalakashna adwani ke blog se naaraaz shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne un par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa, or kaha ki agar adwani main himmat or jigar nahin he to vah 'matoshri' aakar udhaar le jaaen
 He said that the first goal of 2014 is to remove the Congress, but if the 'senapati' starts saying that there are no chances of victory, what will happen to the remaining constituents of NDA
 bal thakare ne yah bhi kaha he ki congress sibiai kii madad se duusare dalon kaa samarthan jutati rahi he
 If Advani knows this, why is he afraid to do this work? thakare kii salaah he ki dilli ke takht ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri or janata dal (united) ke netaa nitish kumaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa jhagada baad kii baat he, or pehali chunauti congress ko dur rakhane kii he
 Bal Thackeray has written that blog is a useless thing, because politics is done in the field, not by laying the mat
 bal thakare ne shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main yah lekh likhaa he, jiskaa sheershak he 'dost, himmat mat haar'
 Thackeray says that Advani's statement is not just about the BJP, it is about the NDA, so we are reacting to it
 adwani ke bayaan se bijepi kii haalia team hataash or niraash hui hogi
 Blog is a useless thing
 abhi congress ko satta se bedakhal karnaa praathamikta honi chahie
 He says that only the NDA commanders started saying that in 2014, if the chance is not there, then the other constituents will keep on staring
 abhi bhavishyavaanee kaa matlab nahin he
 Bal Thackeray wrote that Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and JDU are with NDA to oust Congress from power
 iske alaava unka kahana he ki dusron ko bhi is kavayad main jodenge
 They predict that Pawar, Mamta, Naveen Patnaik and DMK will also join
 bataa den ki bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ke blog ko lekar bijepi ke andar bechaini he
 Advani has written that a non-bjp, non-congress man will become Prime Minister in 2014
 is sarkaar ko bijepi yaa congress baahar se samarthan de sakate hai
 That is, the BJP cannot win on its own
 bijepi ke netaa bhale hi dabi jubaan se isse sahamat na hon, lekin adwani apni baat par kaayam hai
 The comments unka kahana he ki unhone apane blog main jo kuch likhaa he, us par vah kaayam hai
 There is a stir within the BJP about this statement
 adwani ke bayaan se bijepi or narendra modi, donon kii daavedaari par sawaal uthte hai
 This seems to go in favor of Nitish Kumar within the NDA, but Sharad Yadav does not seem to agree with Advani's opinion
 udhar congress adwani ke is daawey kii khilli uda rahi he ki use 100 se kam siten milengi, lekin bijepi ke saamne sawaal ab damege control kaa he
 The party is feeling that this work will happen over time
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2014 kaa pehla lakshya congress ko hataanaa he, lekin agar 'senapati' hi kehane lage ki jeet ke maukey nahin hai, to endie ke baaki ghatakon kaa kya hoga
 Bal Thackeray has also said that the Congress has been mobilizing the support of other parties with the help of the CBI
 agar adwani yah jaanate hai to yah kaam karne main kyon darate hai
 Thackeray's advice is that the quarrel between Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (united) leader Nitish Kumar and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi over the throne of Delhi is a later one, and the first challenge is to keep the Congress away
 bal thakare ne likhaa he ki blog bekaar kii chiz he, kyonki raajnneeti maidan main aakar kii jaati he, chataayee bichhaakar nahin
 Bal Thackeray has written this article in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', titled 'friend, don't dare lose'
 thakare kaa kahana he ki adwani kaa bayaan sirf bijepi se nahin judaa he, baat endie kii he, isliye ham is par pratikriya de rahe hai
 Advani's statement must have frustrated and disappointed the recent BJP team
 blog bekaar kii chiz he
 Right now the Congress should be a top priority
 unka kahana he ki endie kaa senapati hi kehane lage ki 2014 main chance nahin to baaki ghatak dal kiskaa munh takate rahenge
 Right now prophecy is not meant
 bal thakare ne likhaa ki congress ko satta se bedakhal karne ke liye shivasena, akali dal or jediu endie ke saath hai
 Apart from this, he says that others will also be added to this exercise
 unka anumaan he ki pavaar, mamata, naveen patnayak or diemke bhi judenge
 Let me tell you that there is uneasiness within the BJP regarding the blog of BJP leader LK Advani
 adwani ne likhaa he ki 2014 main gaiyr-bijepi, gaiyr-congressi shaks pradhanmantri banegaa
 BJP or Congress can support this government from outside
 yani bijepi apane dam par nahin jeet sakati
 The BJP leaders may not agree with the suppressed tongue, but Advani is firm on his stand
 tippaniyan He says that he stands by what he has written in his blog
 bijepi ke bheetar is bayaan ko lekar halchal machi hui he
 Advani's statement raises questions about the claim of both BJP and Narendra Modi
 yah baat endie ke bheetar nitish kumaar ke paksh main jaati dikh rahi he, lekin sharad yadav hi adwani kii raay se sahamat nahin dikhte
 On the other hand, the Congress is ridiculing Advani's claim that it will get less than 100 seats, but the question before the BJP is now that of damage control
 party ko lag rahaa he, yah kaam samay ke saath hoga

 credit card aapaki kai tarah kii choti-moti jaruratein to puri karata hi he, ab kai car dealer apane graahakon ko credit card se bhugtan kaa vikalp bhi de rahe hai
 In this festive season, dealers do not want any customer to go empty handed due to lack of money and hence they are giving them this option
 ek angreji akhbaar ne khabar di he ki kai automobile dealer is samay graahakon se credit card ke jariye margin mani kaa bhugtan karne ko kehete hai
 This margin is 20 percent of the total cost of a money car
 iske baad shesh bhugtan graahak kisi bhi tarah se kar saktaa he
 The dealer also gives him a loan
 bankers kaa kahana he ki bharat main yah vyavastha pehali baar dekhne main aa rahi he
 Actually, the big reason behind this is that the customer leaves from the dealer and does not return many times if there is no margin money or anything
 isse dealer kii bikri par asar padataa he
 Now they make them pay a little bit through credit card so that it does not change its mind
 ek baar margin mani de dene ke baad graahak bandha sa jaataa he or vah car kharidne ko baadhya ho jaataa he
 At present, about 8% of the total margin money is coming from credit cards
 lekin bankers kaa kahana he ki yah bhugtan kaa uchit madhyam nahin he
 There is more risk in this
 darasal isamen graahak do baar lone letaa he, ek baar credit card ke madhyam se to duusari baar bank se
 a credit card loan is expensive because the interest on it is much higher
 isse graahak par bhaar badhata he
 Not only this, the risk of the bank issuing the credit card also increases because the risk of their loan sinking also increases

 Shekhar is married and an officer in the municipality itself, corrupt according to the practice of worldliness
 udhar, subhash yuva raajnneetik kaaryakarta he, jo babu ji ko nahin balki mukhyamantri dayashankar pandey (rajesh sharma) ko apana adarsh maanata he
 Even if the Chief Minister feels that the courtesy of corruption says that the scam of less than thousand crores is worthless
 mukhyamantri kaa bhaashan likhane vaali tanya se subhash pyaar karata he or babu ji bhi is rishte ko sahmati de dete hai
 Everything is going normal
 or tabhi babu ji kii sarvice kaa aakhri din aa jaataa he
 He feels that he will be honored by giving shawls and coconut for 37 years of honesty
 magar kisi or kii galati ke chalate un par beyimaani kaa daag laga diya jaataa he
 Along with the suspension tip
 babu ji isse jujhane kii himmat hi juta rahe hote hai, magar unke bete fat padate hai
 Seeing this Babuji's hope dies
 jane se pehle vah bete subhash ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main kehete hai
 i want a 21-gun salute before burning a pyre

 The son gets involved in the effort and in this sequence, the relationship-being, the condition of society, the ugly face of politics and the real meaning of life, all start to open up in front of him
 film 21 topon kii salaami kii sabase badi khaasiyat he iske chutile samvaad, saral kahani, magar chust screenple or umdaa acting
 It is said that the dead elephant is also worth 1
25 million
 vahi haal anupam kher kaa bhi he
 When his character looks alive, then there is a lot of beauty to the screen and the story with its acting
 magar unki laash bhi utani hi abhinayavaan lagati he
 It becomes necessary to tell here that Babu's corpse also becomes a character on the lines of two friends, going to the film in the second half and there is a chant
 taaki unke bete unka sammaan se antim sanskaar kar saken
 Divyendu has shown a lot of fire water in Subhash's role

 Hopefully, he gets good and varied roles in Mayanagari
 shekhar ke role main apane babu ji ko koste, darpok, laalchee, bhavuk bade bete ke role main manu rishi ne bhi khub kaam kiya he
 The dialogues of the film also reflect his Delhi influence

 For example, the scene of the Chief Minister's abusive language turning into abusive speech
 magar bhavukta bhare drishyon par aditi ko or mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 In the role of the Chief Minister, Rajesh Sharma puts forward the vulgarity that comes face to face with the joy of sticking to power

 And at the same time, he shows his ability
 film traasadee or ummid ke bich jhulati he
 And it is the work of telling the melodious lullaby
 saamaanya baatcheet ho yaa jhagada yaa phir sajishein
 Dialogues do not leave the ground of reality
 or isliye maarak ban jate hai
 In the same way, be prepared to make an instant opinion poll of TV journalists, or the mother of the CM, presenting claims under dynasty to the high command
 yaa phir sicurity waalon or afasaron se netaaon kaa vyavhaar
 Everything raises a new finger on certain trends in society
 ab baat kuch kamiyon keephali, film kii avadhi plot ke hisaab se kuch zyada ho gai he
 It should have been sorted further
 duusari, subhash ke pyaar kaa angel pasaarne ke chakkar main ek gaanaa do baar tukdon ke andaaj main thel diya gaya he
 This makes the film seem loose in the first half
 teesri, film ke bilkul aakhir main sandesh dene kii manshaa se clymex ko bahut khinch diya gaya he
 Perhaps, to safeguard the title of the film
 swatchta ke sandesh ko or bhi asardaar banane ke liye
 Or to say in the words of Anupam Kher, to speak of the common man's hail
 film '21 topon kii salaami' main star nahin actor hai
 Masala is not a story
 tali bator van liner nahin, magar bhav pravan samvaad hai
 So it is not a bad idea to see it

 In fact, the Election Commission said in a tweet that there was a difference in matching of 8 voter Variable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in the Lok Sabha elections, ie
 0004 fisadi voton kaa milan nahin ho paaya tha
 However, soon after the election, the commission claimed that no VVPAT matching could be found to be the difference
 chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon ke anusaar, yah pratham drushtya maanviya truti kaa maamla he
 There has been a difference in matching of 8 vvpats from Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya and Andhra Pradesh
 adhikariyon kaa kahana ki kareeb 50 voton kaa milan nahin ho paaya tha or yah aam chunaav parinaamon ko prabhavit nahin karata tha
 Experts are questioning this mistake of the Election Commission
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki chunaav ke antim aankade abhi tak saarvajanik kyon nahin kiye gaye hai or chunaavon ke turant baad chunaav ayog ne kyon kaha ki vivipieti milan main koi antar nahin mila tha
 Sources in the Election Commission told Aaj Tak that the final figures of the election are being prepared
 jald hi sabhi aankadon ko saarvajanik kiya ja saktaa he
 Now such a question arises that if the figure of VVPAT is disturbed in the final figures, then what action will the Election Commission take
 kya hota he vivipatbata den, electronic voting mashin (iviem) ke saath voter veriephid paper audit trail (vivipat) judaa hota he, jiske jariye matadaata ko yah pataa chalata he ki jis candidet ke liye iviem main usne batan dabaai he, vot use mila yaa nahin
 How VVPATVVPAT works is associated with EVM
 jab voter iviem main kisi candidet ke naam or chunaav chinh ke saamne kaa batan dabaata he to vivipat se saat second main ek parchi nikalati he
 It states that the candidate who has voted has got the vote

 This decision of the court has given a shock to the Punjab government
 supreme court ke faisle turant baad is masale ko lekar punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh cabinet kii apaat baithak bulaai
 It was decided in the meeting that Punjab will not let a single drop of water out of Punjab
 prakaash singh badal kii aguwai main hui is apaat main faisla liya gaya ki is masale ko lekar raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se apil kii jaaegi ki wo bhi supreme court ke faisle ko naa maane
 a special session of the Punjab Legislative Assembly has been called on 16 November regarding this issue
 vahiin is masale ko lekar punjab main raajnneeti bhi tej ho gai he
 Congress MP Amarinder Singh has resigned in protest against the decision
 punjab ke sabhi congress vidhayakon ne bhi captain amarinder singh ko apane istife bhej die hai
 Congress Legislature Party Deputy Leader Bharat Bhushan said that Punjab Congress mlas have sent resignation to Amarinder Singh
 shuukravaar ko spikar ko vyaktigat taur par istipha saunpege
 He said that Punjab is not in a position to give even a drop of water
 captain amarinder singh ne pehle hi kaha tha ki agar faisla punjab ke khilaaf aayaa to congress ke sabhi vidhayak istipha denge
 On the resignation of Amarinder Singh, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said that this is a political drama
 aage kya karnaa he ye cabinet kii baithak main tay kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court while giving the verdict said that Punjab cannot go out by taking a unilateral decision from the agreement reached with other states
 court ne sutluj yamuna sampark nahar maamle main raashtrapati dwaara bheje gaye sawaalon kaa nakaaratmak jawaab dete hue kaha ki is tarah anya rajyon ke saath jal bantwaare kaa samjhauta radd karne kaa punjab kaa kanoon avaidh he

 Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal has said after the Supreme Court's decision that it is now the responsibility of the governments of both states to implement it
 yah natural justise he or is par kisi ko raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 The Chief Minister said that the decision of the Supreme Court will now be sent to the President
 raashtrapati ab punjab sarkaar ko vah termination act waapas lene ke liye kah sakate hai jo 2004 main punjab vidhansabha main haryana ke khilaaf paarit kiya gaya tha
 On the Supreme Court's decision, Additional Attorney General Devendra Saini has said that the court has ruled in favor of Haryana government in the ongoing water sharing dispute between Nehriana and Punjab
 isse ye saaf hota he ki haryana ko pani milegaa
 He told that the Supreme Court has said that the Punjab government has no right to break the agreement on the issue of water sharing
 ye he vivadastluj-yamuna link nahar ke pani ko lekar punjab or haryana ke bich kaaphi lambey samay se vivaad chal rahaa tha
 In 2004, the then President sought advice from the Supreme Court in this matter and the Supreme Court ruled on the same

 jaise-jaise loksabhaa chunaav najadik aate ja rahe hai, vaise-vaise modi sarkaar ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan kii kavayadon kaa gubbaar footne kii khabar aane lagi he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, due to speculation of alliance between SP-BSP, everyone's eyes have been on the politics of UP from the politics of Bihar
 sutron kii maane to sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or basapa supremeo mayawati ne congress kii mahagathbandhan kii kavayadon ko jhatka dene kaa man bana liya he or congress ko chhod-chhod ek saath saath chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar chuke hai
 According to information received from the sources, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have come close to finalizing the seat-sharing formula in view of the Lok Sabha elections to be held this year and the bus is only delayed
 sutron kaa daawa he ki uttar pradesh kii ye donon badi partiyaan 37-37 loksabhaa siton par saath milakar chunaav ladengi
 Let us tell you that Uttar Pradesh has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 upi kii siyaasi galiyaon main charchaa is baat par bhi he ki basapa-sapa gathbandhan main amethi or raibareli kii siten chhod di jaaengi or vahaan kisi bhi ummidavaar ko nahin utaara jayega
 The seats remaining after this will be left for the Rashtriya Lok Dal and other smaller parties
 yani sapa or basapa ke bich gathbandhan kii baat sahi sabit hoti he to iskaa matlab he ki congress is gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hogi or upi kii anya kshetreey partiyon ko jodne kii sapa-basapa purajor koshish karegi
 If seen in this way, if the SP-BSP meets, then the Congress will be a big shock
 saath hi saath bijepi ke liye bhi kisi bade jatke se kam nahin hogi
 To understand the shock of the Congress as well as the BJP, one will need to look at the vote share of Lok Sabha Elections 2014
 darasal, 2014 main bhale hi basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uskaa vot fisadi sapa ke kareeb hi tha
 The 2014 Lok Sabha elections had emerged as the single largest party and surprised everyone by winning 71 out of 80 seats
 us vakt 71 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ne record kareeb 42 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party had 5 seats with about 22 percent votes
 2014 main mayawati kii basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uske kareeb 20 fisadi vot the
 At the same time, the Congress had won the seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi and secured around 7 per cent vote share
 ab agar 2014 main upi main sabhi partiyon ke vot fisadi par najar daalen to aisa lagata he ki sapa-basapa ke saath hone se upi kii siyasat main bada badlaav dekhne ko milegaa
 If SP-BSP comes together, then both these parties will benefit the most in UP
 isaki vajah he ki agar sapa-basapa ke vot share ko mila diya jaae to yah kareeb 40 fisadi ke aas-paas baithta he, jo 2014 ke mukaable main bijepi ke baraabar he
 Now if the seats are predicted to be won by this vote share, then in 2019, the SP-BSP alliance may occupy more than half of the seats
 iske alaava sapa-basapa chaahegi ki pichde varg kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale raajnneetik dal jaise- nishad party, apana dal (krishna patel) uske saath ho jaae
 If this happens, the 2019 road will become even more difficult for the Congress
 kyonki gathbandhan main naa shaamil kiye jane par pichley chunaav main mahaj 7
 For the Congress, which gets 5 percent of the vote, the difficulties will increase and the dreams of returning to power at the Center can be shattered
 haalanki, sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan se kisi tarah ke siyaasi nuksaan se bijepi inkaar kar rahi he
 UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya says whether or not the SP-BSP alliance, we do not think it will affect us
 desh modi ji ke saath he or unhen ek baar phir se log piem bananaa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Explain that in the assembly elections where BJP 39
 6% vot mili to sapa or bispi ko 22 fisadi
 If both votes are mixed, then it becomes 44 per cent
 congress ko maatr 6 fisadi hi vot mili the
 At the same time, talk of Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP 42 in Uttar Pradesh
 6% vot mili the
 SP got 22 percent and BSP got 20 percent votes

 siddharth shukla (siddharth Shukla) or paras chhabda (paras Chhabra) kii jabardast bahes hui, kyonki paras ne andey zyada ubaal die or wo fatkar kharaab ho gaye
 It is also because eggs have been boiled till now
 lekin tiktaoc (tiktok) par andey ubaalane kaa ek mazedaar tarika viral ho rahaa he
 In this viral video of boiling eggs, you will see that eggs are being boiled in wet soil, not by putting them in water
 pehle geeli mitti lee, use loiki tarah gol akar diya, phir andey ko bich main rakh use puri tarah mitti se cover kar diya
 Just like stuffed parathas are made
 andon ko mitti se cover karne ke baad unhen chuulhe ke upar lakdi ke sahare aanch par rakhaa
 After some time removed the soil from the eggs, washed it in water and then served two pieces of eggs in a plate
 tiktok par viral hua daal pisane kaa ye anokhaa andaaz, nahin dekha hoga aisa sil-battisse pehle tiktok par daal pisane kaa anokhaa andaaz viral ho rahaa tha

 In the meeting held in Delhi after the return of all-party delegation on Kashmir, all agreed that there would be no compromise on the sovereignty of the country
 saath hi is mudde se jude sabhi pakshon se baatcheet par bhi sahmati bani he
 During the tour of Kashmir on 4 and 5 September, all issues were discussed with the delegation of civil society, political parties and government officials
 is dauraan rajya se judi kai samasyaayein saamne ain
 These big issues came up during the all-party delegation's visit to Kashmir
 jaaniye, kya rajya par kya hoga inkaa asar
 
 
 1
 jammu main sachivalay camp kii mangayah hoga asar:jammu shaharajammu-kashmiraki sheetakaaleen rajdhani he
 The day-to-day protests in the valley stalled the functioning of the government
 ghati main beete do maheene se jari hinsa se sarkari kaamkaaj thap padaa hua he
 During the delegation visit, the demand for the permanent camp office of the Secretariat was raised
 aise main jammu main camp offis banataa he to sarkari kaamkaaj par saamaanya taur chalata rahegaa
 2
 leh-ladakh ke liye uti kaa darja die jane kii mangayah hoga asar:dailygation ke daure par bhi leh-ladakh rigen ko centreshasit pradesh kaa darja die jane kii maang uthi
 Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir is also known as 'snowy desert'
 yahaan ke leh main buddha bahul aabaadi jabaki kargil main 99 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 By giving this area the status of Union Territory, its own administrative structure will be ready here
 jammu-kashmir ke 69
 The Ladakh region, spread over 6 percent, will get a separate geopolitical and geocultural identity
 3
 Concerns of the minorities of Jammu and Kashmir have come to light: The news of atrocities on the minority Hindus of Jammu and Kashmir has been reported
 dailygation ke daure par inke hiton kii raksha ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii gai
 Hindus are minorities in the state and Muslims are majority, yet 68 percent of Muslims in the state are getting benefits under minority, whereas in fact Hindus should get these facilities
 pichley 50 saal se rajya main alpsankhyakon ko lekar koi gananaa nahin hui he or na hi alpsankhyak ayog kaa gathan kiya he
 Therefore, the demand for the formation of Minorities and SC / ST Commissions for Jammu and Kashmir arose that it is necessary to create Minorities Commission
 4
 Demand for OBC status to the Lavana Sikh community will have an impact: The Labana Sikh community of Punjab has got the status of the kobc, but the people of this community do not have this status in Jammu and Kashmir
 is vajah se is samudaay ke logon ko samaaj kii mukhyadhara main laane ke liye yah kadam uthaaya janaa jaruri he
 There has also been a demand for giving the status of Scheduled Tribes to the hills in the state
 5
 Minorities will have the chance of MLC, Rajya Sabha
 It will have an impact: There has been a demand to nominate leaders of minority communities as members of the Legislative Council, Rajya Sabha on behalf of the Governor
 isse is samudaay ke logon coloktantric prakriyaaka hissaa banane main madad milegi
 6
 sthaneey nikaay or panchayat chunaav kii maang uthiyah hoga asar:panchayat chunaav loktantric prakriya kaa ahm hissaa he
 Panchayat elections were held in 2011 after a gap of 37 years in Jammu and Kashmir and the tenure of the panchayats was completed on 17 July 2016
 isi tarah riyasat main 26 saal ke antaraal ke baad shahari sthaneey nikaay chunaav 2005 main hue the or kaarykaal 2010 main puraa ho gaya tha
 For the last six years, the body has been electing

 dilli main auto se safar karne vaale logon par mahangaai kii maar padane vaali he
 Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi has decided to increase auto fares in the national capital
 dilli sarkaar dwaara jari adhisuchana ke mutabik badha hua kiraaya tatkaal prabhaav se lagu hoga, yani ki mangalvaar se aapako auto kaa badha hua kiraaya dena padegaa
 Till now, the auto passenger had to pay 25 rupees for the first two kilometers, but now 25 rupees will have to be paid for the first one and a half kilometers
 iske baad har ek kilometre ke liye liya jane vaala kiraaya ab aath rupee se badhkar saadhe nau rupee ho gaya he
 According to statistics, this increase is about 18
 75 fisadi kii he
 Let us know that this decision of the Delhi Government has come only a few months before the Delhi Assembly elections

 isamen koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 For the first time, a provision has been made to pay the passenger even if the auto gets stuck in a traffic jam
 ab jam main funsane par har ek minute ke liye 75 paise atirikt kiraaya dena hoga
 An official said that it is going to take about 45 days to make necessary changes in the meter of the auto, till then the auto will charge the fare according to the new rate
 pichley saptaah dilli ke parivahan vibhaag ne auto rickshaw kiraaya kaa nayaa dar jari kiya tha
 However, some officials had opposed this notification and said that lg's permission would be needed to issue the notification
 aakhirkaar parivahan mantri kailash gahalot kii ijaajat ke baad is adhisuchana ko jari kiya gaya
 Earlier, the Transport Ministry had taken the opinion from the Law Department that there is no need for LG permission to increase the fare
 dilli main apni garlfriend ke ghar main mrit paae gaye arnav duggal kaa maamla abhi bhi ansulajhaa he
 No significant clue has been found in the hands of the police yet
 haalanki police is maamle se jude sabooton ko jamaa karne main juty he
 Now the police are awaiting the post mortem report of Arnav
 dilli ke dwarka main shakuntla apartment ke kamare main jayeernav duggalki laash police ko mili thi, to vahaan koi suicide note bhi nahin mila tha
 However, the police investigated the entire room and an attempt was made to gather evidence
 police ke mutabik kareeb teen ghante tak arnav kii laash faansee ke fande par lataki rahi thi
 According to police officials, the matter is being investigated seriously
 ye maamla khudakushi kaa he yaa phir hatya kaa, in donon hi pahaluon se jaanch jari he
 According to the police it is clear that his friend was present with him at the last moment
 police ne bataaya ki unhen 13 taarikh kii shaam 6 baje is maut ke bare main soochna mili thi
 Now the police want to decide that the evidence related to this case should not be tampered with
 is cese main postmortem report kaa ahm role hoga, lihaaja police ko ab usee report kaa intjaar he
 Also, the police have also recorded the statements of all the witnesses related to this case
 police ke mutabik praarambhik jaanch main yah maamla aatmahatya kaa hi najar aa rahaa he
 Let us tell that Arnav left the house for the party on the night of June 12 along with four of his friends
 vah apni car lekar ghar se gaya tha
 They all drank alcohol in the night
 uske baad aakhir main arnav or uski dost akele rah gaye
 The girl lives in Dwarka's Shakuntala apartment
 arnav 13 june kii subah takreeban 7 baje ke aasapaas ladki ko chhodane uske ghar pahunchaa tha
 The girl reached his home but despite this Arnav kept calling her constantly
 pareshaan hokar ladki ne phone uthaaya or arnav ko ghar aane ke liye kaha
 After that Arnav reached the girl's house
 ladki ke ghar jaakar arnav ek duusare kamare main jaakar so gaya tha jabaki ladki apane kamare main so rahi thi
 When the girl woke up at around 4 in the evening, she went to another room and saw that Arnav had hanged
 kamare kaa manjar dekhakar vah behad ghabara gai
 He then called his father
 uske pita arkepuram main naukari karte hai
 The girl's mother and her brother had gone to Purnia in Bihar during the incident
 pita ko phone karne ke baad ladki ghar se baahar aakar sidhiyon main baith gai
 It took her father about 2 hours to get home
 tab takladkine apni ek saheli ko bhi phone karke ghar par bula liya tha
 Both girls sat on the stairs outside the house
 isi vajah se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki arnav kaa shav kareeb 3 ghante tak faansee ke fande par jhulata rahaa
 DCP Surendra told that the girl's father called the police
 police ne arnav ke parivaar ko phone par ghatana kii jaankaree di
 Investigation revealed that Arnav was a self-made boy
 vah barahavin kaksha ke baad se khud hi kamata tha or gharavaalon se koi paisa nahin letaa tha
 It is being told that the girl who had an incident in the house loved her one-sided
 lekin ladki kii usamen koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 For this reason, the police are initially assuming that this was the reason for Arnav's suicide

 According to this news report, the incident occurred on November 14, 2017, in the township's Gaur police station
 yah aadmi nashe kii haalat main tha or logon ko pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 The magazine also published news about this incident
 angreji akhbaar 'da times aaf india' ne bhi usee din, usee soochna ke saath yah video aplod kiya tha
 Recently, after this video went viral, the Basti Police Network responded by clarifying that the incident is of 2017
 police ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki is video kaa trephic checking se koi sambandh nahin he
 The policemen who are seen in the video are wearing a uniform of cool, so this video has nothing to do with the existing traffic checking
 basti main police dwaara vyakti kii pitayee kii yah ghatana camere main kaid ho gai thi or is krurtapurna bartaav ke liye upi police ko kaaphi aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The claim that this video has gone viral with the video is incorrect that the police did this during traffic checking
 isse pehle is daawey ko fact check website'factly'ne bhi khaarij kiya tha

 @tsrawatbjp@ronniescrewvala— Abhishek Kapoor (@abhishekapoor)december 8, 2018haalanki rajya sarkaar ne film par koi aadhikarik pratibandh nahin lagaaya he, lekin rajya ke sabhi jiladhikariyon ko film or isse jude vivaadon ke bare main likhit sandesh bheja he
 This decision was taken in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 baithak main paryaton mantri satpal maharaj kii adhyakshata vaali ek samiti dwaara film par prastut ek report kii samiksha kii gai
 The government left it to the district administration to decide whether the film should be released in their respective jurisdictions
 iske baad dehradun, haridwar, paudi, tehri, nainital, almoda or udhamsinghnagar main film par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 The film focuses on the devastation caused by the floods in Kedarnath in 2013
 pahari rajya main film kii shooting hui
 The rightists are opposing it and they allege that it hurts Hindu sentiments and promotes 'love Jihad'
 uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko film par pratibandh lagane se inkaar kar diya or yachikakartaon se jiladhikariyon se sampark karne ko kaha tha
 Let me tell you that the film has done well at the box office, grossing almost 17 crores in two days
 bain par boleen sara ali khansara ne kaha- ham logon ne uttarakhand main film kii shooting kii
 We stayed there for 40 days
 maine vahaan par apane jivan ke haseen pal bitaye
 That place has given me a lot
 mujhe dukh he ki main vahaan ke logon ko ye pyaar waapas nahin kar pai mere liye ye asli malaal he
 Sara further said - It is wrong to divide on the basis of caste and religion
 film divide karne ke bajaay, saath jodne kaa sandesh detii he
 i don't see how people are being hurt
 mujhe nahin lagata ki jo log aisa kah rahe hai unhone film dekhi he
 Stress has increased in the last few days in India and China
 dragon bharat ko lagaataar 1962 yuddh kii yaad dilaa rahaa he to vahiin bharat par panchasheel samjhaute ko todane kaa aarope bhi laga rahaa he
 On the other hand, this time also no soft attitude has been shown from India
 sarkaar kii ore se bhi kai mantriyon kii ore china ko lekar sakht bayaan aae hai
 Defense Minister Arun Jaitley had said that China should remember that the situation is no longer like 1962
 seemaa par bhale hi kitni bhi tanatani ho, lekin china ke liye bharat ke saath dobaaraa yuddh karnaa yaa phir zyada dinon tak aankh dikhaanaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 Understand why
 
 
 1
 The largest market in China, India is the largest market in China
 pichley kai saalon se china kii ore se bharat main aayaat badha he, haalanki bharat kii ore se niryaat main thodi kami zarur ai he
 About 71 in 2016-17 between the two countries
 18 arab dollar kaa kaarobaar hota he, jisamen china is samay bharat ko 59
 It exports goods worth $ 43 billion annually, which is around 13 percent of its total imports
 centre sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik march 2017 tak china ne bharat main 4
 Has invested 91 billion dollars
 saaf he ki china agar bharat se rishte bigaadane kii koshish karata he to uske vyapaar par kaaphi asar padegaa
 2
 america kaa sathbharat or america ke bich sambandh pichley kaaphi samay se majboot hote gaye hai or china ko is dosti se kaaphi dikkatein bhi hai
 It has also surfaced on several occasions
 haal hi main china kii ore se bayaan bhi aayaa tha ki bharat america raashtrapati donald trump ke kaaran hi china ko ankhen dikhaa rahaa he
 Donald Trump also constantly talks about America First, which can have a direct impact on China
 kyonki china kii kai companiyaan puri duniya main faili hui he, agar bharat-america se sambandh bigadate hai to china jis global market kaa sapana sanjota he wo khatre main pad saktaa he
 3
 kai companiyon par asarayah to saaf he ki bharat china kaa sabase bada bazaar he
 Chinese companies also play an important role in India, and sell their goods in large numbers in India
 in companiyon main linovo, hair, hawaii, tisiel, oppo, vivo jaisi badi companiyaan shaamil hai
 4
 china se ye saamaan aayaat karte hai hambharat china se jo chijen aayaat karata he unamem mobile, tivi, charger, memory card or mujeec upkaran sabase ahm hai
 Also included are utensils, auto accessories, building materials, sanitary items, kitchen items, tiles, machines, engines, pumps, chemical, fertilizers, iron and steel, plastic, boats and medical equipment
 5
 Now there is strength in the Indian Army too
 It is clear that now the situation of India and China is not like 1962
 bharat ek kaaphi majboot desh ho gaya he, sainya maamalon main bhi bharat kii takat badi he
 China is also afraid of India's Brahros missile
 iske alaava bhi bharat kii takat badi he
 According to globalfirepower
com, the Chinese Air Force has a total of 2,955 aircraft
 isamen se 1,271 fiter aircraft, 1,385 atake aircraft, 782 transport aircraft, 352 trainer air craft, 206 atake helicopter samet kul 912 helicopter hai, jabaki bharat ke paas 676 fiter aircraft, 809 atake aircraft, 857 transport aircraft, 323 trainer aircraft, 16 atake helicopter samet kul 666 helicopter hai
 Talking about the army, China has the largest army in the world
 china ke paas 22 lakh 85 hajaar sashastr sainik hai, to 5 lakh 10 hajaar rigerv sainik bhi hai
 Not only this, China has 6 lakh 60 thousand soldiers as paramilitary forces
 vahiin, bharat ke paas 6,457 yudhak tanks, 4,788 bakhtarband ladaaku vaahan, 1,710 swachaalit vaahan or 1,770 rocket projector hai
 The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) of China has an aircraft carrier, 51 warships, 36 destroyers, 35 warships, 68 submarines, 220 petrol craft, 31 mine warfare vessels
 china ne buudhvaar ko hi apane sabase bade vidhvansak tip-055 ko launch kiya tha
 In comparison, India has three aircraft carriers, 14 warships, 11 destroyers, 23 warships, 15 submarines, 139 petrol craft and six mine warfare vessels
 aircraft karier ke maamle main bharat china se aage he
 After all, on which disputes face China - Tension on the border regarding Sikkim region - India's third party in Bhutan dispute - NSG: India has been trying to enter the NSG group but China has consistently opposed it
 - bharat main pakistan kii taraf se badhate aatankwaad kaa jahaan bharat hameshaa virodh karata rahaa he vahiin china ne hameshaa pakistan kaa bachaav kiya he
 - India's opposition to pok's share in the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - India and China also have a dispute over the Brahmaputra River
 darasal china yahaan baandh banaakar china sara pani apni ore mode rahaa he jiskaa bharat lagaataar virodh karata rahaa he
 - What is the situation on the Dalai Lama and Tibet disputes right now? The situation of tension with China at the height of illegal infiltration in Indian border and then Sikkim on the map is at its peak
 bharat ne ek ore kaha ki ham 1962 vaale halaat main nahin he, china hamen kamjor nahin samajhen
 At the same time China said - Do not consider us 1962 China as well
 chini media ne kaha- ham apni jameen bachaane ke liye jang ke str tak bhi ja sakate hai
 Soldiers have been sent to both sides in this area
 yahaan bharat ne dokala main jo sainik bheje hai, unhen non kambative mod main tainaat kiya gaya he
 Around 2 due to a flight being 5 hours late to British Airways
 36 karod rupye bataur muaavja dena hoga
 Flight delays were caused by no toilet paper
 ab soshal media par is ghatana kaa majaak bhi ban rahaa he
 The case is Sunday
 flite ko landan se barbados janaa tha
 But the flight passengers were told that the flight was delayed due to some reasons
 iske baad baar-baar company ne deree ke liye alag-alag kaaran bataae
 One passenger said that he was told that there was a cleaning problem, hence the delay
 kai yatriyon ne flite main deree ko lekar twit kiya tha
 a passenger also wrote that the cost cutting of British Airways has become so high that it no longer has stock of toilet rolls
 europe main vimaan companiyon ke liye deree hone par vishesh kanoon he
 For this reason, they will have to pay damages to the passengers
 company ke pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘kai jaruri chijen samay se plane main nahin rakhi ja saki thim
 This was delayed
 hamen iske liye khed he

 ’’ bhavari devi sex scandle or hatyakand ke aarope main jail main band ashok gahalot sarkaar ke purv mantri mahipal maderna ne jodhpur ke sahakaari bank ke haal hi ke chunaavon main parivaar kii jeet ke baad kuch is tarah kham thoka, to soobe kii jat raajnneeti ke karavat lene kaa sanket de diya
 Mahipal Maderna's wife Leela Maderna was elected vice-president in this election while Mahipal was sitting in jail
 is parivaar kii aguai main puraa sanchaalak mandal nirvirodh chunaa gaya
 The importance of a decisive Jat vote in the formation of power created a stir among political parties
 haashie par ja pahunchaa maderna parivaar asal main pradesh kaa ek bada rajnatik gharaana he, jo 1952 se hi pradesh kii raajnneeti main sakriy he
 Its relatives are also in their own houses like Kadakathi, which has access to the Congress high command
 bhavari devi prakaran main maderna kii giraftaar ke vakt bhi sadakon par utre samarthakon ke hujum ne jat raajnneeti par is parivaar kii pakad kii ahmiyat jatala di thi
 Who wouldn't want to take political advantage of such a family? Especially when the state assembly elections are due this year
 dausa ke saansad or pi
 a
 sangama kii neshnal pipuls party (enpipi) ke pradesh adhyaksh dow
 Kirodilal Meena has had many meetings with the Maderna family
 lekin mahipal ke jail main hone kii vajah se lila abhi pattey nahin khol raheen
 She makes these appointments a form of formality
 jabaki meena khulkar bataate hai, ‘‘mahipalji to jail main hai, lekin unke parivaar kaa hamaari party main swaagat he
 Senior BJP leader Rajendrasinh Rathore, including former BJP state president and presently vice-president Arun Chaturvedi, has also met Maderna and his family
 kya maderna ke liye bijepi ke daravaaje khule he? jawaab main chaturvedi bataate hai, ‘‘is bare main party ne abhi tak sochaa nahin he
 i went to meet as a courtesy
 ’’bijepi daanv ulataa padane ke dar se pattey nahin kholana chaahati, kyonki bhavari devi se jude samudaay khafa ho sakate hai
 However, after his arrest in the Dara Singh case, Rathore remained in Maderna's cell in jail
 donon ne ek saath khaanaa khaane se lekar batiyate hue kai din saath gujaarey
 After coming out of jail, Rathore kept in touch with the Maderna family
 bhale bijepi in mulakaaton ko shishtachar bhent bataa rahi he, lekin raajnneeti main ek mashhoor kahawat he, dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 rathore-maderna is said to be suffering from the same "magician" (title given to Ashok Gehlot in the state)
 maderna parivaar kii bijepi se badhati pingon kii ek ahm vajah yah he ki jab bhavari devi prakaran ke samay mahipal apni hi party congress main alag-thalag kar die gaye the, us vakt vipakshi dal bijepi ne unhen nishaanaa nahin banaakar gahalot sarkaar ko gheraa tha
 As part of its future strategy, the party did not take any action that would pamper Maderna and her family
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi or maderna kii kadamtal kii sambhaavna banane lagi he
 However, Congress wants that the Maderna family should not have alliances with any other party as this family has influence in the entire state
 khaskar jat bahulya siton par sidhaa
 Therefore, the Congress has sought Divya Maderna's name in the panel of candidates for election from Pali Lok Sabha seat based on the internal report
 lekin maderna parivaar ke anya dal main jane kii halchal par pradesh congress adhyaksh dow
 Chandrabhan says, "the Maderna family is a true servant of the Congress
 ’’ lekin maderna kii beti divya maderna bataati hai, ‘‘hamaare khilaaf ek rajnatik shadyantr khelaa gaya
 Due to which the farming class of the state is angry with the Congress and its impact will go far
 ’’philhal maderna parivaar chunaavon ke do maheene pehle apane pattey kholane kii baat kar rahaa he
 The reason for this is Maderna being in jail
 agar is vakt yah parivaar koi bada kadam uthaa letaa he to shaayad maderna kaa jail se baahar aana or pechida ho jaae
 Divya says, "right now our focus is on the case
 ’’jaahir he ki agar chunaavon se pehle maderna kii jamaanat ho jaati he to in chunaavon main unki bhoomika kaaphi ahm hogi
 On the other hand, if Divya Maderna plays forward, even then the role of Maderna sitting in jail will be important

 His trusted aide o Panneerselvam was made the Chief Minister the same night

 rohit kaa maananaa he ki mumbai indiens ke liye indian premier lig main chauthe number par ballebaaji karne se isisi champiens trophy main bharat ke liye opening karne main unhen koi samasya nahin hogi
 Rohit said in the press conference, 'IPL is very different from international cricket
 maine ipel ke shuru hone se pehle hi yah baat kahi thi ki team ko santulan dene ke liye main nichle kram main ballebaaji karuunga
 i do not understand why people compare the two situations

 unhen isamen koi samasya nahin he
 Rohit Sharma further said, 'this has been happening for 10 years
 khilaadi ipel khelkar 50 over ke match yaa test cricket khelte hai
 i don't think it would be difficult to adapt to it
 ’tippaniyan Rohit also spoke about his experience of winning the IPL title for the third time
 unhone bataaya ki unke liye sabhi khitaab khaas hai, lekin unhone match ko best qaraar diya
 Asked which title he liked the most, he described the title of this season as the best, and said, 'I cannot choose one of them
 lekin beeti raat kaa tii20 match, maine jo match khele hai, unamem sarvshereshth rahaa
 i am very happy kisi bhi team ne isse pehle teen baar ipel nahin jeeta he
 This is a big achievement and we will retain this confidence
 ' Rohit Sharma, known for his explosive batting, has dismissed the batting position's questions as unnecessary and said that such questions have no meaning, as there is a difference in the format of the Champions Trophy and the IPL
 vaise ipel jahaan tii-20 cricket he, vahiin champions trophy vanade praaroop main hogi
 Rohit believes that batting at number four in the Indian Premier League for Mumbai Indians would not be a problem for him to open for India in the ICC Champions Trophy

 He said that the opposition does not want to have a political debate and wants to divert the issue of development
 congress party jaanati he ki jitna kaam pichley 5 saal main modi sarkaar main hua he, utana kaam congress ke 50-55 saal ke shashan main nahin hua
 He knows that if there will be a debate on the issue of development, then it will hurt the Congress party

 isko vichaaron ke taur par dekhnaa chahie
 This is not a personal allegation
 nitin gadakari ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi or puraa vipaksh milakar 23 taarikh ke baad sirf yah tay kar den ki unka pradhanmantri koun hoga? itane main bhi baat saaf ho jaaegi
 On opposition unity against PM Modi and BJP, Gadkari said that the entire credit for the harmonious unity of the opposition goes to BJP
 chunaav ke haar se pehle ye log bahaane shuru kar die he
 Nitin Gadkari said that when 1971 Pakistan was fought, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the leader of the opposition

 There is no guarantee that popular leaders should always be courageous reformers or that governments formed by majority will prove to be champions of reforms! Only these two old beliefs remain
 narendra modi ko ab inhen bhi tod dena chahie kyonki bharat ke logon ne unke liye sarkarein chunane kaa taur-tarika sire se badal diya he
 In any period of the last three-four decades, there will not be such a phase in which India's complex regional and political identities have become so condensed in any one leader, as has happened with Modi
 itihaas gavaah he ki bharat ke voter naak par makkhi nahin baithne dete
 After the recession, unemployment, rural plight, the governments make headlines in the next election itself, but this time people suppressed the pain and despair, creating a bigger wave in favor of Modi
 kisi rajaneta se ummiido kaa yah akhil bhartiya uchhaah, taaja rajnatik ateet ke liye ajanabi he
 The grand acceptance of Indian voters, famous for their refusal, has brought 69-year-old Narendra Modi to a place where he can now be a leader who is not only popular but also a big reformer
 ronaald regan, lee kwan you, yaa margaret thatcher jaise
 That means leaders who change the direction of their countries for the next several decades
 america vichaarak james friman kehete the ki ki rajaneta agle chunaav ke bare main sochate hai or raashtra netaa agali peedi ke bare main
 After 2019, Narendra Modi will have to be different from Modi of the last five years
 2014 se 2019 tak narendra modi, apni party ke rashtravyapee chunavi ashwamedh ke nayak rahe hai
 His campaign to win every election at all costs was focused on the purpose of winning the Lok Sabha again in 2019
 yah muhim hi thi jiske chalate modi kaa apekshit sudhaarak, avatar nahin le sakaa
 They continued to co-ordinate between the poles of reformer and populist politics and five precious years passed
 abhootpurv lokapriyata ke baad modi ko itnaa bada jan vishwaas phir mil gaya he jisase ve sabhi bade sudhaar sambhav hai jinke bare main unke purvavarti sochakar rah jaaya karte the
 Modi would certainly like to build a legacy now
 kuch aisa karnaa chahenge jisase unhen bharat ke antarrashtriya netaa ke bataur yaad kiya jaae
 Major reformers are always identified with economic reforms
 ve apane desh ke logon kii aay badhaakar jivan str badalte hai
 Not only did America have a decisive drop in unemployment and a record increase in GDP after Ronald Regan's (1981–89) major tax reforms, grand privatization, loosening of economic regulations, heavy investment on security and policies reaching the roots of the economy
 Highest after 1929–39), but the biggest change was that people's trust in governmental institutions (crisis of confidence-jimmy Carter 1979) Financial rise
 1970 ke dashak ke ant main britain kii bikharati arthvyavastha or niti shoonyata kii prishthbhumi main margaret thatcher ne britain kii satta sanbhali thi
 But the change came after 1983 when Thatcher got a strong mandate in the face of divided opposition despite heavy unemployment
 unhone is maukey kaa laabh lekar britain ke welfare state ko badalakar mukt bazaar kii raah kholi
 With control over inflation and private housing, Thatcher created Britain's new middle class
 1965 main malaysia se aaazaad hua lee kuan you (1965-90) kaa singapore kuch hi dashakon main menuphaccharing or videshi nivesh udaarikaran se global companiyon kaa centre ban gaya
 With the control of corruption and the improvement of social policies, u put Singapore in the line of developed countries
 regan, thatcher or you ke sudhaaron main modi ke bhavi agenda kaa blueprint mil saktaa he
 These three leaders are also known for their blatant policies and tough decisions regarding national security
 bharat main pichley adhikansh aarthik sudhaar sankaton se bachane ke liye hue hai
 How much India has changed only by them! Now, if the thoughtful future-oriented structural changes begin, then the next five years can secure the next fifteen years of India
 taaja itihaas main modi pehle aise netaa hai jinke saamne koi bada sankat nahin he
 The popularity stemmed from the expectation has blessed him with unprecedented opportunities
 chunavi itihaas to ban gaya he, ab modi ko sudhaaron kaa itihaas gadhana chahie
 The presence of the best leaders is not felt

 —lao Tse, ancient Chinese philosopher and author (anshuman Tiwari is the editor of India Today) *** soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) se khulaasa hua he ki beete paanch vittiya varshon ke dauraan vilay yaa shakhabandi kii prakriya se saarvajanik kshetra ke 26 sarkari bainkon kii kul 3,427 bank shakhaon kaa mul astitv prabhavit hua he
 The special thing is that 75 percent of these branches of the country's largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) have been affected
 aalochay avadhi ke dauraan esbiai main iske paanch sahyogi bainkon or bhartiya mahila bank kaa vilay hua he
 This information has come out through RTI at a time when work has started on the government's new plan to convert 10 state-owned banks into four big banks

 According to this, 26 public sector banks of the country closed 90 branches in the financial year 2014-15, 126 branches in 2015-16, 253 branches in 2016-17, 2,083 bank branches in 2017-18 and 875 branches in 2018-19
 Gone or merged with other bank branches
 artiai arji par mili jawaab ke anusaar beete paanch vittiya varshon main vilay yaa band hone se esbiai kii sarvaadhik 2,568 bank shakhaaen prabhavit huin
 The RTI activist also wanted to know from the RBI about the closure of branches of public sector banks
 lekin unhen jawaab nahin mila
 On this question, the central bank, citing the relevant provisions of the RTI Act, said that the information sought is not an information, but an "opinion"
 arabiai ne bataaya ki state bank of india ke saath bhartiya mahila bank, state bank of bikaner and jaipur, state bank of hyderabad, state bank of mysore, state bank of patiala or state bank of travnakor kaa vilay ek april 2017 se prabhavi hua tha
 In addition, the merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda came into effect from 1 April 2019
 is bich, saarvajanik bainkon ke karmchaaree sanghathanon ne inke vilay ko lekar sarkaar kii nayi yojana kaa virodh tej kar diya he
 All India Bank Employees Union (AIBEA) General Secretary CH Venkatachalam said "pti-bhasha", "if the government forms four big banks by combining 10 state-owned banks in the country, at least 7,000 branches of these banks may be affected
 
 inamen se adhikansh shakhaaen mahanagaron or shaharon kii hongi
 "venkatachalam feared that the business of the concerned public sector banks would decline after the proposed merger, as it has generally been seen that customers' close association with a bank branch closes or merges with another branch

 It is now being known that the election results of 11 December, which ousted Shivraj Singh Chauhan from the chair of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, were just the beginning of the political tremors that awaited the veteran leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 Were living
 janadesh ke do din ke bheetar chouhan ne elaan kar diya ki ve kahin nahin ja rahe hai or pradesh kii raajnneeti main bane rahenge
 He said that he would soon embark on a 'gratitude journey' of the entire state
 par unke is mansoobey par jaldi hi pani phir gaya jab kendriya netritv ne unase ise tilanjali dene ke liye kah diya
 Then came the news that he was ready to be the leader of the opposition
 yah ohada aakhirkaar purv mantri gopal bhargav (jo unke kareebi nahin maane jate) kii jholii main chalaa gaya
 Then Chauhan showed interest in becoming BJP state president
 magar dilli main rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak ke ek din pehle chouhan yah dekhakar hairaan rah gaye ki unhen duusare do rajyon ke chunaav haar chuke purv mukhyamantriyon—yani rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje or chhattisgarh ke raman singh—ke saath rashtriya upaadhyaksh bana diya gaya he
 The message from the central leadership was clear: Chauhan will not be able to achieve his wish any more
 chouhan ne mukhyamantri ke taur par 13 saal tak bedadak raaj kiya tha or is dauraan kai ubharate siyaasi pratidwandviyon kaa kad chota karne main kaamyaab rahe the
 But now the opponents are firing against them and beating them at every turn
 chouhan is chakravyuuh se bhala kaise niklenge?soobe ke siyaasi jaankaar maanate hai ki chouhan ke khilaaf talavaarein myaan se baahar aa gai hai
 Everyone knows that the former Chief Minister of the BJP is not a favorite of the current central leadership of BJP, Narendra modi-amit Shah
 chouhan ne unhen kareeb-kareeb bharosa dilaa diya tha ki chunaav se pehle vahi unke liye sabase umdaa daanv hai
 But now they seem to be politically out of sight — despite the fact that the party performed well in Madhya Pradesh, in which it garnered far more votes than the Congress and 109 seats against the Congress' 114 seats in the 230-member assembly Also missed out on getting a majority by a very small margin
 vikalp unke saamne kam hi haih ve loksabhaa kaa chunaav lard sakate hai or agar bhaajapa phir jitkar centre main sarkaar banaati he to mantri banakar praasangik bane rah sakate hai (aresas ke saath unke achche rishte yah pakkaa kar sakate hai)
 The other option would be to stay in the state's politics and try to destabilize its government in view of the very small majority of the Congress
 agar ve isamen kaamyaab rahete hai to phir mukhyamantri kaa ohada hasil kar sakate hai lekin yah aasaan nahin hoga
 Those doing this will have to compete with veteran leaders like Kamal Nath and Digvijay, who are old masters of this game
 chouhan ke saamne teesraa vikalp yah he ki ve agle chunaavon main, phir ve chaahe jab bhi hon, bhaajapa ke liye madhya pradesh fatah karne ke liye kaam karen
 He has also expressed interest in it
 iske liye kadi mehnat kerani hogi, dheron yatraaen kerani hongi or logon se milanaa padegaa
 But Shivraj Singh Chauhan is most eager for this work because he is able to do all this very easily
 ve satta se baahar bhale hon, par logon ke dilo-dimag main bane rahane kaa unka iraadaa pakkaa he or lagaataar yatraaen praasangik bane rahane kii unki koshishon kaa hi hissaa hai
 But sometimes the plans are reversed
 18 janvari ko aisa hi hua jab chouhan sthaneey nagarpalika ke adhyaksh prahlaad bandhavaar kii hatya kaa virodh karne or rajya main kanoon-vyavastha ke dhwast ho jane ke khilaaf congress sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye aanan-fanan mandsaur ke liye nikal pade—tabhi bich raste main unhen pataa chalaa ki aaropee unki apni party kaa netaa he
 Meanwhile, he himself is facing a challenge from within his own party
 kabhi unke saathi rahe kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars, rajya sarkaar main purv mantri narottam mishra, bhaajapa mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey, rajya adhyaksh rakesh singh, sabase badhkar upaadhyaksh prabhaat jha, in sabko chouhan ko baahar rakhane kaa saajha agenda mil gaya lagata he
 Another incident that says a lot is that Chauhan's public relations and press notes are now handled by a different team and that team has nothing to do with the state BJP office
 satta se baahar rahakar praasangik bane rahanaa zyaadaatar netaaon ke liye jabardast chunauti hoti he
 The results of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections will be very important
 yah baat party ke kendriya netritv or uske faislon se prabhavit hone waalon, donon ko acchhee tarah pataa he
 The only hope of the BJP is that the anti-incumbency against Vasundhara Raje will disappear with the Lok Sabha elections with the handing over of the leadership in new hands
 yahi nahin, bhaajapa ke paas isaki koi yojana nahin he ki rajasthan kii purv mukhyamantri kaa istemaal kaise kiya jaae
 Raje said on February 10 that even though she has been made the party's vice-president, she will not leave the state
 ve apane nirvachan kshetra jhalarapatan main party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kar rahi thim
 It falls in the jhalawar-baran parliamentary constituency, from where his son Dushyant Singh is a three-time MP and this time he is expected to contest elections
 charchaa he ki raaje se aam chunaav ladgaye ke liye kaha jayega taaki unhen rajya kii siyasat se baahar nikaala ja sake, par unhone apni ore se aisi afvaahon ko khaarij karne kii bharpoor koshish kii he
 Raje has been visiting her son's constituency and has also started campaigning in a variety of ways
 unhone swine flu ko jisane 100 logon kii jindagi leel lee or sheetalhar ke chalate 10 kisaanon kii maut ko lekar (purv mukhyamantri kaa aarope he ki ye mautein isliye huin kyonki sarkaar ne kheton main sinchai ke liye bijli raat main di jab taapmaana main acchhee-khaasi giravat aa gai thi) nai congress sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 There are speculations that the party wants Raje to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 iskaa matlab yah hoga ki dushyant ko tikat se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Another section believes that if the BJP wins the Lok Sabha elections, Raje can be asked to join the central government
 isaki zyada sambhaavna najar aati he, khaskar tab jab sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali or manohar parrikar sareekhe bade mantriyon kii sehat bahut acchhee nahin chal rahi he
 But Raje can insist on making her son Dushyant a minister
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichhali baar khud unke mukhyamantri hone ke chalate unki is ichha ko thukraa diya tha
 So how can BJP use Raje? After the election defeat, the party has so far tried to confine them to the backyard
 unke pratidwandvi or aresas ke pansadeeda gulabchand kataaria vipaksh ke netaa hai
 He comes from the Jain community and is an eight-time MLA
 vahiin saat baar ke vidhayak or rajput samudaay se aane vaale rajendra rathod vipaksh ke upanetaa hai
 Both have been ministers in the state for a long time, but their impact on the people of their caste is limited
 raaje se najdiki ke chalate rathod kabhi aresas ke nishane par hua karte the
 It is said that in recent times, he has been trying to improve relations with the anti-union and anti-raj lobbies
 pichley hafte unke haathon netaa vipaksh ke liye kataaria ke naam kii peshkash kiye jane se pehle bhaajapa ke 73 main se 54 vidhayak raaje se vipaksh kaa netaa banane kii guzarish karne ke liye unke ghar par jamaa hue the
 Both Rathore and Kataria have faced cases of murder in fake encounters
 kataaria ke khilaaf soharabuddin encounter cese main (jisamen ek vakt gujarat police or party adhyaksh shah bhi aaropee the) mukadmaa darj kiya gaya tha, jabaki rathod ko 2006 main sharaab taskar daara singh kii maut ke maamle main ek maheene jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 Both were later acquitted
 rajasthan main bhaajapa kaa mansuba 'kamjor pad gaye' sanghathan ko majboot banane kaa he
 The state president, 74-year-old Madanlal Saini, was posted before the legislative assembly elections as he was a ground worker
 us vakt bhi thodi khinchataan hui thi kyonki raaje ne kendriya rajyamantri or is ohade ke liye modi kii pasand 51 varshiya gajendra singh shekhavat ko rajya adhyaksh nahin banane diya tha
 Now that Rathore is the deputy leader of the opposition, the party will not be able to bring Shekhawat to the post of state president as the Lok Sabha elections are very close
 kendriya rajyamantri rajyavardhan rathod rajya main bhaajapa ke ek or lokapriy netaa hai or unke saathi general ve
 K
 singh bhi (donon rajupat), par bhaajapa ke paas dushyant singh ke alaava koi pramukh jat cheharaa nahin he
 Raje is a Rajput himself, he was married to a Jat and is his daughter-in-law Gurjar — hence he can be considered above caste equations
 chunaavon ke najadik aane ke saath bhaajapa ko matadaataaon par unke asar or vidhayakon par unki pakad ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hi hoga
 In Chhattisgarh BJP, swords have come out of the sheath
 nishane par rajya ke purv mukhyamantri raman singh hai, jinaki 15 saal se chali aa rahi hukumat kaa disambar main congress ke haathon bhaajapa kii jabardast haar ke baad khaatmaa ho gaya tha
 The number of his party's seats in the 90-member assembly came down to 15 from the 49 seats in the previous elections, calling it a referendum on the policies and decisions of his rival Singh
 raman ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki haar ke baad bhi unke saath party kaa ravaiya utana sakht nahin he jitna madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan ke saath rahaa he
 He claims that state BJP President Dharamlal Kaushik has been made the Leader of the Opposition at the behest of him and he will be heard even when the new State President is appointed before the Lok Sabha elections
 chouhan jahaan madhya pradesh kaa daura kar rahe hai, vahiin unke ulat raman aaraam kii mudra main hai
 "this is because Raman Singh is not a man to run after positions and positions," claims one of his colleagues
 "chunaav ke baad raman dilli jarur gaye the
 Not only does he have a good relationship with the central leadership of the BJP but he is also considered close to Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh main sarkarywah krishna gopal ke saath unke achche sameekaran hai
 But what can still eclipse his political future, is that the assessment of a faction within the state BJP is that it is necessary for the party to pursue strong OBC (other Backward Class) leadership so that the Congress in these communities Mobilization can be thwarted
 rajya main mote taur par 50 fisadi matadaata obisi samudaayon se aate hai—jinamein kurmi, sahu or yadav samudaay pramukh hai
 This perception is gaining momentum in the BJP because the Congress has won 68 seats under the leadership of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, a Kurmi leader
 ek rujhaan pehle hi ubharta dikhaai de rahaa he—netaa vipaksh banaae gaye kowshik pichde samudaay se aate hai jabaki chandrashekhar sahu, jinhone chunaav se thik pehle kisaan karj maafee se inkaar karke muft mobile phone baantne ke raman kii sarkaar ke faislon kii aalochana kii thi, bhaajapa ke pramukh sahu netaa hai
 "if the OBC leadership in Chhattisgarh is even a little stronger, it will be at the cost of Raman," says Ruchir Garg, media advisor for Baghel
 " party ke bheetar obisi chehre par jor die jane se rajya bhaajapa ke ek or pramukh netaa brijmohan agarwal bhi khud ko ghira hua pate hai
 On the other hand, Baghel has ordered an inquiry into the alleged scams during the previous government and the former Chief Minister will have to question his inquiries too
 jahaan raman ne nai sarkaar ko koi bhi gadabadi sabit karne kii chunauti di he, vahiin unke pratidwandvi ulate unhen pareshaani main daalane kii aas lagaae hai

 com / ?q=recruitment The government passed two bills in the Lok Sabha on Thursday amid heavy uproar
 ek bill rasinic hathiyaaron par antarrashtriya kanveshan se judaa he jabaki doosraa bill desh main akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan yani ames kii tarj par chah or sansthaanon ko kholane se sambandhit he
 When the house resumed at 12 noon, both these bills were passed within the first 10 to 15 minutes
 jab bill paas hua us samay bijepi ke kai saansad wel main the or pradhanmantri ke istife kaa naaraa laga rahe the
 However, Leader of the Opposition in the House Sushma Swaraj was sitting on her seat and was looking at the business list of the Lok Sabha
 bill paas hone kii prakriya main bijepi kii taraf se kahin bhi koi aapatti darj nahin karai gai
 Later, outside the House, bjp's national vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi termed the passage of the bill in this way as 'theft of government and malpractices' as well as violation of parliamentary procedure
 bijepi kii hi nazama hepatullah ke mutabik sadan ko order main laae bina bill paas karana sanvaidhanik taur par galat he
 On the other hand, NDA convenor and JDU president Sharad Yadav said that the AIIMS Amendment Bill was for the benefit of common people and before it was passed, the consent of both him and Sushma Swaraj was taken
 sarkaar kii taraf se bhi daawa kiya gaya ki bihar, uttar pradesh or rajasthan samet chah alag-alag rajyon main ’ames’ khole jane par sabhi dal ekamat the isliye ye bill paas karaayaa gaya
 According to the Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, Shrikant Jena, no party had raised any objection during the discussion that took place before the introduction of the bill relating to chemical weapons combustion
 isliye is ’gaiyr vivaadaaspad’ bill ko aasaani se paas kara liya gaya
 The comments koyala khaadaan aavanton main ghotaale kii sieji report ke baad bijepi pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang par adi he or pichley do hafte se sansad nahin chalane de rahi he
 In such a situation, the passing of these two bills indicates a compromise between the government and the BJP
 sutron kii maane to bijepi is baat ke liye taiyaar ho gai he ki vah sansad main pesh hone vaale bahut zaruri bill ke paas hone main roda nahin atakaayegi
 Although the government also tried to get the Whistle Blower Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, the BJP did not allow it to pass
 sansad ke monsoon satr main sarkaar 32 bill ko paas karana chaahati thi, lekin sansad thap padi he or zyaadaatar bill atake pade hai
 The current session of Parliament is till 7 September and in such a situation the government will have to try to pass some more bills

 baad main sadan ke baahar bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas naqvi ne is tarah se bill paas karaane ko ’sarkaar kii chori or siinaajori’ ke saath-saath sansadeey prakriya kaa ulanghan bhi bataaya
 According to bjp's Najma Heptullah, it is constitutionally wrong to pass the bill without bringing the house in order
 duusari taraf endie sanyojak or jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki ames sanshodhan bill aam logon ke hit se judaa he or ise paas karaane se pehle unase or sushamaa swaraj donon kii sahmati lee gai thi
 The government also claimed that all the parties were unanimous when the 'AIIMS' were opened in six different states including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, hence this bill was passed
 rasayan or urvarak rajya mantri shrikant jena ke mutabik rasinic hathiyaaron ke kanvation se jude bill ko pesh karne se pehle hui charchaa ke dauran kisi dal ne koi aapatti nahin jataai thi
 Hence this 'non-controversial' bill was easily passed
 tippaniyan After the CAG report of the coal scam allocation scam, the BJP is firm on the demand for the Prime Minister's resignation and the Parliament has not been allowed to run for the last two weeks
 aise main in do bilon kaa paas hona sarkaar or bijepi ke bich samjhaute kii taraf ishaara karata he
 If sources are to be believed, the BJP has agreed that it will not obstruct the passage of the very important bill to be presented in Parliament
 haalanki sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko rajyasabha main whisl blor bill paas karaane kii bhi koshish kii lekin bijepi ne ise paas nahin hone diya
 In the monsoon session of Parliament, the government wanted to pass 32 bills, but Parliament is stalled and most of the bills are stuck
 sansad kaa maujuuda satr 7 sitabanr tak he or aise main sarkaar kii koshish kuch or bill paas karaane kii hogi

 mahangaai kii jabardast maar bundelkhand ke garibon ko jhelana pad rahaa he

 Vegetables are so expensive in Bundelkhand that the poor cannot buy a green vegetable even if they want, even after eating salt

 Overall, in this era of inflation, if the poor here do not get gram saag, they should be forced to eat dry bread
 haalanki ucch or madhyam varg ke liye yah saag hari sabji se kam nahin he
 Those people are also buying it with a hobby at an expensive price

 (input agenciyon se bhi) Virat Kohli, the Indian batsman who scored a century on the third day of the Adelaide Test against Australia, lashed out at the Australian players for constantly chastising them and not honoring the Indian cricketers to the local audience
 kohli ne kaha, austrailian khilaadi jab hataash ho jate hai tab chhintakashi karte hai
 There was definitely a very warm atmosphere at the crease
 ve lagaataar khilaadiyon par chhintakashi kar rahe the taaki ve dhyaan bhang kar saken
 Kohli played an innings of 116 runs to help India score 272 runs in the first innings on the third day of the fourth and final Test
 unhone kaha, ‘meri or riddhimaan saaha ke bich saajhedaari ke dauraan ve kaaphi zyada chhintakashi kar rahe the
 There was a moment on the field when Kohli got into a verbal battle with Australian Ben Hilfenhaus, after which he survived the run out
 unhone kaha, ‘hilphenhas ne mujhase kuch kaha jo bilkul hi gairajaruri tha
 Don't know where he came from even though he was not bowling
 main 99 ran par ran out hone se bachaa
 He told me some words that i cannot say in the press conference
 ’ kohli ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘maine bhi use kaha ki tumhen isse kuch lenaa dena nahin he to tum aisa kyon kar rahe ho
 'they don't regret what Kohli did
 unhone kaha, ‘ishanth or maine donon ne palatakar bolnaa shuru kiya or haaavee ho gayi jisase vah kaaphi bhadak gaya
 i usually play cricket like this
 maine jo kuch kiya, usase main khush hum
 Ricky Ponting had to come to the rescue midway and Kohli was dragged away by the former Australian captain and away from the debate, which calmed things down a bit
 kohli ne kaha, ‘ponting ne mujhase kaha ki main uskaa jawaab nahin duun varna bekaar main mujhe pareshaani hogi
 He really helped me
 ’ aid kowan or david warner ne perth main kohli or ishanth par gusse main kuch shabd kahe the, lekin unhone is yuva ballebaaj se kuch nahin kaha
 He said, 'he congratulated me
 donon ne aisa hi kiya
 Both did not say anything
 sidney main ve mere peeche pade hue the kyonki main ran nahin bana rahaa tha or yahaan maine shatak bana liya
 During the second Test in Sydney, Kohli showed the middle finger to the audience for which he was fined 50 per cent of the match fees
 kohli ne kaha, ‘aapako shabdic rup se jawaab dena hota he
 It is better to score a century by doing so
 ham maidan par kisi (darshakon) se kisi tarah kii baat sunne nahin jate
 We are international cricketers
 ham isamen sirf bhagidaari ke liye nahin aaye
 They have to know this and we have to tell them this by speaking and by their performance
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah kabhi kabhaar kaaphi niraashajanak ho jaataa he
 They say things that should not be said on the cricket field
 ham maidan par khilne jate hai, kisi kii gaali sunne ke liye nahin
 If they have come to enjoy cricket, they should do so
 na kii sharaab pikar khilaadiyon ko gaali deni chahie
 This is not good behavior towards players
 ’kohli ne kaha, ‘agar khilaadi kuch kahata he to us par jurmaana or pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 Viewers can go to their home by saying anything
 yah uchit tareeke se hona chahie
 ' garmiyon ke samay main jo cheez sabhi ko raas aati he wo he 'pani'
 The best idea to enjoy in this scorching summer season is to go on a trip to a place where many types of water sports are present
 taaki aap apane trip kaa bharpoor majaa le saken, lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki water sports ke lihaaj se koun si aisi jagahen hai joki aapke liye best 'samar destination' sabit ho sakati hai
 
 
 scuba diving agar aap water sports ke divaane hai to aapako apni life main ek baar scuba diving jarur kerani chahie
 For the best experience of scuba diving, you should turn to Andaman
 yahaan aapako is adventure sport kaa puraa majaa mil sakegaa
 Under water walk morishas duniya bhar main chhuttiyaan manaane or ghoomane-phirane ke lihaaj se sabase acchhee destinations main se ek he, lekin agar aap 'under water si walk' karnaa chaahate hai to iskaa best experions aapako morishas main hi milegaa
 Believe that the fun of walking in the depths of the sea will be most unique and memorable
 rafting For those who love adventure more then water sports like rafting are made for them only
 white water rafting kaa majaa lenaa he to iske liye aapako rishikesh ke liye apane bag pack karne chahie
 The cool water of the Ganges will refresh you completely and the rafting in the rapid will complete all the tasks of adventure
 scuba diving If you are a water sports enthusiast then you must do scuba diving once in your life
 scuba diving ke best experions ke liye aapako andaman kaa rukh karnaa chahie
 Here you will get full enjoyment of this adventure sport
 under water walk Mauritius is one of the best destinations for holidaying and traveling around the world, but if you want to 'walk under water sea', then you will get the best experience in Mauritius
 yakeen maniye samudr kii gaharaai main chalane kaa majaa sabase niraala or yaadgaar hoga
 Rafting jinhen adventure se kuch zyada hi pyaar he to rafting jaisaa water sport unheen ke liye bana he
 If you want to enjoy white water rafting, then you should pack your bags for rishikesh
 ganga ke thanda pani aapako puri tarah se rifresh kar degaa or rapid main uchhalati raft adventure karne kii sari kasar puri kar degi

 RSS kii pakad kerala main jamini str parvipaksh bhi bijepi kii ubhaar se ghabarihui he
 Because in the last assembly election, the BJP surprised people by its vote percentage in many seats
 saath hi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ne apni sthiti main sudhaar laane main safal rahi thi
 The BJP got 6 per cent of the votes in the 2011 assembly elections, while it rose to 10 per cent in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn yah rahaa ki bijepi tiruvanantpuram main congress netaa shashi tharur ko kadi chunauti dene main safal rahi
 On the other hand, the hold of the RSS in Kerala is very strong and the BJP is trying to capitalize on it this time
 bijepi kerala main is baar behad aakraamak tareeke se hindutv card bhi khelti najar aa rahi he
 There have been many such incidents in Bihar in the last few days, which seem that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar no longer has control over governance and administration
 adhikansh maamalon main jin vibhaagon se sambandhit ghatnaayen hui hai wo mukhyamantri ke adheen aane vaale grih yaa jail vibhaag kii ghatnaayen hai
 But the most shocking thing is that earlier, after the action after any incident, Nitish Kumar used to show his administration but now that readiness and will power is not seen in his reaction after these incidents
 pichley 48 ghante ke dauraan do alag-alag ghatnaayen huin
 One was in Nalanda, the chief minister's home district, where his party's MLA Jitendra Kumar reached Biharsharif Sadar Hospital on Saturday
 ek party kaaryakarta kii maut ke baad apane manmutabik postmortem report na milane par gaali-galouj kii or dhamkee di jisaki pratikriya main vahaan ke doctor hadtaal par chale gayi
 Certainly whatever was done by Jitendra Kumar reminds me of the RJD rule
 lekin nitish kumaar ne apni party kaa vidhayak hone ke kaaran is durvyavhaar par koi karrwai nahin kii
 On Saturday, a video of Sitamarhi jail went viral where a prisoner Pintu Tiwari who is convicted for killing two engineers celebrated his birthday in jail
 jail main janmdin manaane kii kisi ko roak nahin
 But it was recorded on mobile and when the banquet took place, many inmates are seen talking on the phone comfortably
 jail vibhaag ke mukhiya nitish kumaar khud hai or bihar main ek bhi jail main jaimar nahin he, to shaayad iske liye unase adhik koi or vyakti doshi nahin ho saktaa
 But some jail staff have been suspended following the incident
 lekin sachaai yahi he ki apradhi jail se nitish raaj main bhi samanaantar shashan chalaate hai or unke swasthya par koi asar nahin hota
 7 policemen suspended after the killer's birthday in Bihar's Sitamarhi jail, VIDEO went viral
 Even more embarrassing and shocking incident occurred in Gopalganj in the state where a contractor Ramashankar Singh was burnt alive for not paying 15 lakh in bribe
 haalanki police is maamle kii jaanch hatya or aatmahatya donon angel se kar rahi he lekin police aaj tak aaropee jal sansaadhan vibhaag ke mukhya abhiyantaa muralidhar singh yaa unki patni ko giraftaar nahin kar pai he
 This is probably the first incident in Bihar for officials to burn a contractor alive if not bribed
 lekin yah dikhaata he ki bina ghoose ke bihar main koi adhikari kaam nahin karata he bhale mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhrashtachar ke kilaaf zero tolerance niti kii duhai dete rahe
 However, the Chief Minister proved his claims against corruption hollow at the same time that IPS officer Vivek Kumar, who is facing investigation of Bihar's Economic Research Unit in the midst of Lok Sabha elections, who is accused of colluding with liquor mafia, Nitish Kumar Ended his suspension and posted him to a new post in a hurry
 khud nitish kumaar sharabbandi par kabhi naa samjhauta karne kaa daawa karte hai lekin loksabhaa chunaav main gaya kii ek sabha main bindi yadav ko apane bagal main baitaane se unhone parhez nahin kiya
 What is Bindi Yadav and despite the prohibition of liquor, there was no alcohol scandal in his house
 tejasvi yadav bole, bihar kii kanoon vyavastha maranasann haalat main, police kaa kaam apane aakaaon kii
 
 
 The police department of which Nitish Kumar is the head of the police opened in Supaul at a time when there was no firing from any gun at the funeral of former Chief Minister Dr
 Jagannath Mishra as the bullets were fired
 iskaa video desh or videsh main viral hua
 Inquiries were ordered but nothing has been done in the name of action till date
 isse pehle 10 din pehle bihar ke chhapra main ek daaroga or jawan kii hatya kar di gai or is hatya main istemaal kiya gaya pistal jila parishad adhyaksh minaa arun kaa tha
 Many relatives of Meena Arun are accused in this murder
 minaa arun kii bhi kai tasviren vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne jari kii
 Experts believe that Nitish Kumar no longer cares about what is being published in the media and how much criticism he is getting because he knows that as long as there is an alliance with BJP, there is no impact on the government from different incidents
 Falls
 unhen is baat kaa bhi andaaza he ki media ke bhaajapa virdohi varg ke liye wo khalanaayak hai to bhaajapa samarthit media bhi unhen har ghatana ke baad hero se zero banane main koi kasar nahin chodta
 But the people of Nitish's party believe that now gradually their Iqbal is decreasing, so incidents are increasing
 vanade siries se pehle team india kaa abhyaas match main jeet kaa silsilaa jari he
 Team India defeated Leicester by 15 runs in a T-20 practice match on Monday
 team india ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 20 overon main 5 wicket par 161 ran banaae
 Parthiv Patel scored the highest for India
 iske jawaab main licester kii team 20 overon main 7 wicket par 146 ran hi bana saki

 unhone 29 ran dekar 3 wicket liye
 The issue of making Bangla language a must in schools in the hilly areas of West Bengal has caught up
 is vivaad ko lekar darjeeling main tanaav kaa maahaul he
 BJP MP and Union Minister SS Ahluwalia has blamed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for this situation
 'bangla thope rahi hai mamata banerjee'ajtak ke saath khaas baatcheet main ahaluwalia ne kaha ki mamata banerjee galat dhang se bangla bhashaa ko logon par thope rahi hai
 He alleged that this decision was not passed in the cabinet of West Bengal
 balki mamata banerjee ne pichley dona ek sammelan ke dauraan bangla ko anivaary banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 However, Ahluwalia made it clear that he is not against any one language
 'bangla ke virodh main darjeeling ke log'ahaluwalia kaa kahana tha ki mamata banerjee apane munh se nikali baat ko hi kanoon samajhati hai
 According to him, the mother tongue of the people in the areas of Darjeeling is Nepali
 wo rashtrabhasha ke taur par hindi or roji-roti ke liye angreji siikhnaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, there is no place for Bangla under the three-language formula
 ahaluwalia kaa aarope tha ki mamata ne paise ke istemaal or sarkari tantra ke durupyog se darjeeling korporation kii siten jeetin hai or ab wo logon ke daman main juty hai
 'tourists turn around' Ahluwalia admitted that tourism is very important for Darjeeling's economy
 lekin is andolan ke chalate aam sailaani pareshaan hai
 Mamta Banerjee made it mandatory to teach Bengali in schools throughout Bengal
 iske khilaaf guuruuvaar ko pradarshan hinsak ho gaye the
 Army has been deployed to control the situation
 aaj 12 ghante kaa band he
 Thousands of tourists who came to visit Darjeeling have been stranded due to the bandh

 Syria has detained four Indian youths trying to join the terrorist organization ISIS and has asked the Indian authorities to verify their details
 bharat kii teen din kii yatra par aae syria ke up pradhanmantri walid al muoulam ne kaha ki chaar yuvak syria main aae the or unhen damishq main hiraasat main liya gaya
 However, he did not say when he was caught
 walid ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'chaar bharatiyon ko damishq main syria kii hiraasat main le liya gaya
 Four Indian youth were trying to join ISIS and emigrated from Jordan to Syria
 ' haalanki unhone yuvakon ke naam, unhen kahaan se pakadaa gaya or kab hiraasat main liya gaya, aadi jaankaree nahin di
 The comments is ghatnakram ko mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he, kyonki bharat yuvaaon ko aatankwaadi sanghathanon main shaamil hone se rokane ke prayaas kar rahaa he
 In December last year, the police arrested three youths from Nagpur airport who were trying to leave the country to join ISIS
 syria ke videsh mantri kii bhi jimmedaari nibhaa rahe walid ne un 39 bharatiyon kii rihaai main madad main asamarthta jataai, jinhen june 2014 main iraq ke shahar mosul main iesas aatankwaadiyon ne bandhak banaaya tha
 Walid said, "if they had been in the custody of the Iraqi force, i would have tried to ensure their release, but if they are still hostage to ISIS then i cannot do anything
" ' The Deputy Prime Minister of Syria, Walid Al Mu'oolam, who is on a three-day visit to India, said that four youths had arrived in Syria and were detained in Damascus
 haalanki unhone yah nahin bataaya ki unhen kab pakadaa gaya
 Walid told reporters, 'four Indians were taken into Syrian custody in Damascus
 chaar bhartiya yuva iesas main shaamil hone kii koshish kar rahe the or jordan se syria main aa gaye the
 However, he did not provide the names of the youths, where they were captured and when they were detained, etc
 tippaniyan This development is considered important as India is trying to prevent the youth from joining terrorist organizations
 pichley saal disambar main police ne nagpur hawaondde se teen yuvakon ko giraftaar kiya tha jo iesas main shaamil hone ke liye desh chhodane kii firaaq main the
 Walid, also serving as the Syrian foreign minister, expressed his inability to help in the release of the 39 Indians who were held hostage by ISIS militants in Iraq's city of Mosul in June 2014
 walid ne kaha, 'agar ve iraqi bal kii hiraasat main hote to main unki rihaai sunishchit karne kaa prayaas karata, lekin agar ve ab bhi iesas ke bandhak hai to main kuch nahin kar saktaa

 ' purush ho yaa stri, sundar dikhne kii chahat to har kisi main hoti he
 It is a different matter that women do a hundred things to look beautiful, while men are often seen lagging behind women in this case
 aadhunik chalan ke mutabik, kai yuvatiyaan 'hot-hot' dikhne ke chakkar main ajeebogareeb dress pahan leti hai
 Some of them believe that a little openness is necessary to feel 'hot'
 kuch logon kii najaron main yah badalte vakt kii maang he
 The other side of this is that to look 'hot' it is not necessary to wear body shimmery clothes
 shaleen va bhare-puure kapadon main bhi 'hot' bana ja saktaa he
 People from across the seven seas also like Indian women very much because of their decent clothes
 matlab yah ki sari ko bhi agar shaleen tareeke se pahana jaae, to vah bhi 'hot' ho sakati he
 Then, 'fix your intelligence, don't go on display
 
 
 ' Union Steel Minister Chaudhary Birendra Singh said that a steel house can be built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) for just two lakh rupees

 This requires diversification and optimum use of steel in projects
 tippaniyan Singh stated that the allocation under PMAY 1
 5 lakh rupee he, pahari rajyon ke liye yah 1
 6 lakhs
 gramin vikaas mantralay ne bainkon ke saath 70,000 rupee ke liye gathjod karne kaa bharosa dilaayaa he
 In this sense, the allocation will reach above two lakh rupees
 ispaat se banane vaale makaanon par saamaanya taur par do lakh rupee kii laagat aegi
 He said that these houses will not only increase the consumption of steel and infrastructure in the country, but it will also be more robust and durable
 mantri ne kaha, ‘‘ye ghar na keval kam keemat ke honge, balki inkaa nirmaan bhi teji se kiya ja sakegaa
 We have seen such houses in Gangtok

 The Supreme Court today gave a major verdict allowing the 24-week pregnant rape victim of Mumbai to have an abortion
 court kaa kahana he ki agar mahila kii jaan ko khatra he to 20 hafte baad bhi garbhpaat karaayaa ja saktaa he
 The court has given this decision within the ambit of the law itself
 act kaa section 3 kahata he ki 20 hafte se zyada hone par garbhpaat nahin ho saktaa lekin section 5 kahata he ki agar mahila kii jaan ko khatra ho to kabhi bhi garbhpaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has considered this case as Life vs Life and said that abortion can be done so that the life of the woman is in danger, but whether the 1971 law is right or not, the Supreme Court will continue to hear it
 ullekhneey he ki medical termination of pregnancy act 1971 ke mutabik 20 hafte se zyaada garbhvatee mahila kaa garbhpaat nahin ho saktaa
 The rape victim of Mumbai had challenged this act in the Supreme Court, calling it unconstitutional and sought permission to have an abortion
 mahila ne apni yachika main kaha he ki vah behad hi garib parivaar se he uske mangetar ne shaadi kaa jhansa dekar uske saath balaatkaar kiya or use dhokhaa dekar duusari ladki se shaadi kar lee, jiske baad usne mangetar ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa cese darj kiya gaya
 When the woman came to know that she was pregnant, she underwent several medical tests, which showed that if she does not undergo an abortion, she can be killed
 2 june 2016 ko doctoron ne uskaa garbhpaat karne se inkaar kar diya kyonki use garbhadhaaran kiye 20 hafte se zyaada ho chuke the
 The woman said in her petition that when the law was enacted in 1971, the 20-week rule was correct at the time, but now the time has changed, now even after 26 weeks, abortion can happen
 isse purv supreme court ko mumbai ke KE medical aspataal ne report saunpi thi, jiske baad court ne yah faisla sunaaya
 During the hearing of the case on July 22, SG Ranjit Kumar, on behalf of the Central Government, suggested that a medical board be formed in the matter which would examine the woman and decide whether she could be miscarried
 iske liye AIIMS ke doctor kii ek team banaai jaae jo mahila kii jaanch karegi
 The comments lekin yachikakarta ke vakil ne kaha tha ki mahila mumbai he or vah dilli aane main sakasham nahin he
 In such a situation, it should be investigated in Mumbai itself

 It is a happy coincidence that when the prestigious Hindi literature writer Chitra Mudgal was announced last week for the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Award for the year 2018, there were only five days left to complete seventy-five years of her life
 lekhkeey garima ke saath saamaajik sakriyata ke pachhattar varsh puure hone kii vela par sahitya academy sammaan kii ghoshnaa unhen dohari khushi de gai
 When asked about this happiness, she says in her familiar soft voice, "it is an honor for my social commitment to the deprived sections and my literature arising from it
 '' baat sahi bhi he kyonki 2016 main prakashit unke jis upanyaas post box nan
 203 Nala Sopara has received the Sahitya Akademi Award, a novel expressing the torture, struggle and dream of "third gender" victim of gross neglect in society
 haal ke varshon main "third gender'' par likhe gaye upanyaason main yah is lihaaj se vishisht he ki isamen tathyon kii jagah samvednaa or soochnaaon kii jagah vishleshan ko pramukhataa di gai he
 Here the life-facts of the eunuchs are not threaded as facts and figures, but within the narrative in such a way that the novel has become extremely poignant
 upanyaas is baat kaa behtareen udhaaharan he ki chintan, tathy or aankadon se bojhil kiye bina upekshit tabakon kii jindagi par utkrisht rachana likhi ja sakati he
 The entire novel is composed in the form of sequential letters written to her Ba (mother) by Vinod alias Binny alias Bimli, handed over to the circle of eunuchs during her schooling, describing her life situations and memories of home
 maa bhi apane kinnar putr ko patr likhti he par ve javaabi patr prishthbhumi main rahete hai
 It is known from the letters written by the son that what the mother wrote in her letter? Letter-style is considered best suited for expressing thought-flow or thought-flow, but the author has done a unique experiment by expressing story-flow through it and has also been successful in it
 upanyaas main bharpoor katha-ras kii maujuudagi unke rachanaatmak kaushal kaa pramaan he
 Like a normal human being, a dignified, dignified life is the dream of Vinod, the main character of the novel, but the authors are skeptical about the role of politics in fulfilling this dream
 mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti kii dilchaspee kinnaron ko maanviya garima dilaane main nahin balki aarakshan kaa laalach dekar unhen vot bank ke rup main sirf upyog karne kii he
 Therefore, they prefer social solutions to this problem more
 upanyaas ek bada prashn uthaata he ki ek lingapujak samaaj lingavihinon ko kaise bardaasht karegaa? yon kendrit samaaj se mukti hi is upanyaas kaa swapn he or iskaa kendriya kathy bhi
 The scope of Chitra Mudgal's concern has been wide since the beginning
 saamaajik, aarthik yaa langik har prakaar kii vishmata ke viruddh unhone anwarat sangharsh kiya he or aaj bhi ve in prashnon par mukhar rahati hai
 Social anomalies always motivate him to write
 premchand kii kahani thakur kaa kuan ne unhen rachana-karm kii ore prerit kiya
 She says, "this story of Premchand instilled in me a strong antipathy towards caste discrimination
 kahani padhgaye ke baad jab main jatigat bhedbhaav ke prati sachet hui to maine dekha ki aisa bhedbhaav to swayan mere ghar ke log bhi karte hai
 "it was the beginning of being free from caste superiority for Chitra, the granddaughter of Thakur Bajrang Singh of the famed zamindar clan of Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh
" jo baat ve kah nahin sakati thim use unhone likhakar abhivyakt karnaa shuru kiya
 Chitra is not among the creators, whose life and creations show enormous contradiction
 jivan main suvidhabhogi hona or rachana main vidrohi bananaa unki fitrat nahin he
 They do not fill the lack of conflicts in life with creation
 stri ke prati pakshadharata unke jivan or sahitya, donon jagah spasht dikhti he
 If she believes that a woman should have the right to make her own decisions, then she also certifies it with her life
 ham kalpana kar sakate hai ki saath ke dashak main ek thakur jameendaar parivaar kii ladki kaa antarjaateey prem vivaah karnaa kitna kathin rahaa hoga
 Their opposition in the family continued for a long time
 virodhon ke bich hi unke lekhkeey vyaktitv ne aakaar liya he
 During his higher education in Mumbai, renowned labor leader Dutt came in contact with Samanta and had a strong association with the organized and unorganized sector labor movements
 vahaan unhone bade gharon main jhaadu-pochhe kaa kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke liye sangharsh kiya
 We can say that Chitra Mudgal has not raised the flag of female discourse but has lived it
 isiilie unka stri vimarsh kuch fashneble stri vimarshkaron se adhik vyapak or sarokaardharmee he
 She makes female discourse more comprehensive and concerned than body discourse and strongly opposes devaluing female discourse in body discourse
 ve stri prashn ko pashchim ke najariye se nahin balki bhartiya sandarbhon main samajhane or sulajhane par jor detii hai
 Perhaps that is why she has no concern about motherhood and wifehood as seen in some feminists
 ve kahati hai, "main stri-purush ke bich kii gairbarabari ko samaapt karnaa chaahati hum lekin unke vaishishy ko samaapt kar stri ko number do kaa purush bana dene ko main kahin se bhi uchit nahi maanati
 Chitra Mudgal, who considers Rachna-karma as synonymous with social intervention, has so far enriched Hindi literature through nearly thirteen story collections, four novels and five children's fiction collections
 rachana-karm ko saamaajik hastkshep kaa paryaay maanate hue bhi unhone kabhi "rajnatik rup se sahi'' hone kii chintaa nahin kii
 His commitment was not to any writer's organization or party but to literature and his society
 unhone apane ab tak ke jivan or sahitya ke jariye patibaddhta or sarokaar jaise shabdon ko party or sanghathanon ke bandhan se mukt karne kaa kaam kiya he
 They are proof that the creator does not need membership of any party or organization to be committed and concerned with his society
