 '' The five accused were eventually acquitted in Mecca Masjid
 hyderabad kii is masjid main jume kii namaaj ke dauraan hue bam dhamaake main nau log maare gaye the or 58 jakhmi hue the
 Nearly 11 years after the accident, a special court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) acquitted all the five accused for lack of evidence
 hyderabad ke chauthe atirikt metropolitan seshan jaj ke
 Ravindra Reddy resigned just hours after delivering the verdict
 unke mutabik, ve kuch samay se istipha dene ke bare main soch rahe the or is faisle kaa makka masjid maamle se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 However, the time of resignation surprised many and encouraged those thinking of conspiracy
 hyderabad ke saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki unhen jaj kaa faisla ‘paheli-sa’ laga
 He described the NIA as a blind and deaf parrot
 enie kaa kahana he ki vah faisle kii jaanch karegi, par sabooton ke abhaav ko dekhte hue kuch hi logon ko ummid he ki vah iske khilaaf apil karegi
 a key accused, Swami Asimanando, was arrested in 2010 by CBI for the first time in connection with the blast before the case was handed over to the NIA
 ve 2007 main ajmer dargah main hue bam dhamaake main bhi aaropee the, jisamen teen logon kii maut hui thi or unhen pichley varsh march main doshamukt kiya gaya
 The NIA did not appeal against that decision
 2007 main hue duusare dhamaake—nai dilli se lahore jane vaali samjhauta express main dhamaake ke maamle main bhi aseemanand ko aaropon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, haalanki do maamalon main bari hone ke baad ab ek maamle main doshi tehraaya janaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 It was Aseemanand's statement that changed the story to domestic Hindu terrorism in 2007 and 2008 in relation to the bomb blasts rather than cross-border terrorism
 hyderabad police ne shuru main ek pakistani jehadi sanghathan par andeh jataayaa tha or muslim yuvaaon ko ghere main liya tha
 Before the investigation was handed over to the CBI, the Hyderabad police presented five suspects who had allegedly confessed to obtaining RDX from their Bangladeshi colleagues
 sibiai ne aseemanand ko giraftaar kiya, haalanki baad main ve apane bayaan se palat gaye or daawa kiya ki vah bayaan unase dabaav main liya gaya tha
 The CBI gathered stories about Hindu religious groups who planned and materialized the revenge attack on the temples, but it certainly did not add links to it and in 2011 the case was investigated by the NIA
 handed over to
 enie sibiai kii hi line par aage badi, lekin adaalat main apni kahani ke paksh main ahm saboot nahin pesh kar pai
 Either the CBI or the NIA or both have bungled this investigation
 naam na bataane kii shart par ek andruni sutara ne bataaya ki enie jaanchakartaaon ne sunwaayee ke liye soochibaddh 226 gavaahon ko paryaapt rup se taiyaar nahin kiya tha, unamem se ek badi sankhya main gavaah enie ke khilaaf ho gaye
 The reversal of witnesses has also been a feature of the Ajmer Dargah, Samjhauta Express and Malegaon bomb blasts cases
 maalegaanv prakaran main vishesh sarkari abhiyojak rohinee sallian ne kaha tha ki centre main bhaajapa ke satta main aane ke baad enie ne unhen aropiyon par narmi baratane ko kaha tha
 This confirms the suspicions of the government's critics, who claim that the government has no desire to act on the acts of fundamentalist Hindu groups
 ovaisi kehete hai, ‘‘inako doshamukt karne ke baad aatankwaad ke khilaaf hamaari ladaai kamjor ho gai he
 "the mystery still remains in front of us as to who killed the Mecca Masjid
" bam dhamaake main aseemanand ke saath sanliptata kii baat swikaarne vaale devendra gupta ko ajmer dargah dhamaakaa maamle main yojana banane ke aarope main aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai gai
 Do these blasts happen at a gap of just five months? Why have dozens of witnesses turned upside down? NIA to start investigation again from zero? Those who lost family members on May 18, 2007 must have been disillusioned by the knee-jerkness of officials of the country's premier investigative agency

 Tanushree Dutta has accused Nana Patekar of molesting her during the shooting of the film 'horn Ok Please' 10 years ago
 pichley dinon ek intervyuu mentnushrine kaha he ki ek item song ke dauraan naanaa intimet hona chaahate the, lekin ve iske liye taiyaar nahin thim
 There has been an uproar for several days following this statement
 ab is puure maamle par abraakhi savantka bayaan saamne aayaa he
 By the way, Rakhi Sawant is considered to be the Queen of Controversy, her statement here matters because Rakhi Sawant replaced Tanushree Dutta in a song of 'horn Ok Please'
 raakhi saavant ne haal hi main media ke saamne apana paksh rakhaa ki maine 'horn oke plis' ke gane main tanu ko riples kiya tha
 Rakhi told, "tanu shot the song of the film but left it in the middle
 uske baad mere paas koreographer ganesh acharya kaa phone aayaa, unhone bas itnaa kaha, tum set par aao, gaanaa karnaa he
 "rakhi said," i was surprised to hear that because suddenly what song? "ganesh Acharya said," Just Rakhi Tum Aao Jao, the song i have made, i have to shoot now
 raakhi ne bataaya, mere paas naanaa patekar kaa bhi phone aayaa
 They started saying that you should sing
 maine jab ye suna to fouran set par pahunchi"raakhi ne bataaya ki set par pahunchane ke baad mujhe pataa chalaa ki gaanaa tanushri kaa he
 She has shot this song a bit but now she is not cooperating
 abhi wo apni venity main hai, jahaan unhen sab bulaane ja chuke hai lekin wo baahar nahin aa rahi hai
 After this Rakhi said, "at that time Daisy Shah was the assistant of Master ji and she told all the things that she herself went to call Tanushree 10 times but she did not open the door
 "raakhi ne kaha, "naanaa patekar ne mujhase kaha, tum kaise bhi sab sambhaal lo kyonki itnaa bada set laga he, 100 se zyada dancer hai
 The producer's money is invested, he will die
 raakhi ne kaha, jab maine sab suna tab main khud tanu ko bulaane gai lekin wo nahin ai
 Then i called her hair dresser and makeup artist
 tab mujhe asli vajah pataa chali"raakhi saavant ne khulaasa kiya, "us din tanu drugs lekar vine main 4 ghante se behosh padi thim
 Tanu is talking big things today
 lekin main unki asaliyat sabko bataanaa chaahati hum
 Rakhi said, When i performed the song of Tanu, he also sent me a note
 lekin film kii team ne mujhe bachaaya or kaha ki raakhi ne aakhri maukey par hamaari madad kii he"raakhi kaa kahana he ki main marate dam tak naanaa patekar ji ke saath hum
 i have done many songs with Ganesh Acharya
 tanushri bekaar kii METOO campagne chalaane main lagi hai
 What is the whole matter? Tanushree has accused Nana Patekar of profanity and molestation during the shooting
 unhone 2008 main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan naanaa par apane saath jor jabardastee kii koshish kaa aarope lagaaya
 He had said, "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer, he was not a part of the song during the shooting, though he tried to get intimate with him
" gane ke koreagrapher ganesh acharya, diarector rakesh saarang or produsar sami siddiki sab is baat se waakif hai, lekin kisi ne kuch nahin kiya
 Tanushree said that Nana used to beat heroines
 industry main har kisi ko maaloom he ki heroinon ko lekar wo hameshaa se hi aise rahe hai
 In this case, Ganesh Acharya's reaction has come to light
 ganesh ne naanaa ko clinit di he
 After which Tanushree called Ganesh a liar and a mongrel
 tanushri ke aaropon par kya bole naanaa?naanaa patekar ne bombai times se baatcheet main kaha ''abhi main jaisalmer main shooting kar rahaa hum
 As soon as i reach Mumbai on 7 or 8 October, i will do a press conference
 main camere ke saamne har sawaal kaa jawaab dena chahta hum
 Feel free to ask me anything
 mere paas chhipaane kii koi vajah nahin he
 Nana continued, "it's up to you what you want to trust
" kya aapako lagata he ki main itnaa ganda insaan hum? kya log mere bare main kuch bhi nahin jaanate
 i do not need to prove my good character
 main filmon main zyada dance nahin karata, to main kisi se kuch bhi ashleel step ke liye kyon kahuunga
 In such a situation, i can either deny all these allegations and say that she (tanushree) is lying or i can drag her to court to spoil my image

 The 34th day of the Ayodhya case in the Supreme Court, the arguments were issued by the Muslim side, today is the 34th day of daily hearing of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute in the Supreme Court
 shuukravaar (27 sitambar) tak muslim paksh kii daleelein jari rahi thim, aaj bhi muslim paksh apni daleel rakh rahaa he
 After this, they will be responded to from the Hindu side
 is jawaab ke baad adaalat main suut-number 4 par sunwaayee shuru hogi
 Before the Hindu side's arguments started, Shekhar Nafade on behalf of the Muslim side said in the court, now Nizam Pasha is making his arguments
 somvaar ko sunwaayee ke bade apadet:02
 52 PM: During the Ayodhya hearing, on behalf of the Muslim side in the Supreme Court, Nizam Pasha said that according to the Quran and the Hadith, how can anyone build a mosque
 kisi bhi zamin par bina minar or vajookhaana ke masjid banaai ja sakati he
 He said that even if there has been a temple before, a mosque can be built there
 nism pasha ne kaha ki masjid main kahin murti ho yaa deevaaron-khambhon main nazar main naa aane vaali tasviren yaa murtiyon bani hon to bhi namaaz jaays hoti he
 Bells are also forbidden in mosques because Rasul did not like the sound of bells
 ibne batuta ne bhi likhaa he ki bharat main masjidon main bhi kai jagah ghantiyaan thim
 It was said from the Muslim side that Babur went to the Dargah of Nizamuddin and Qutub Saheb after winning the battle of Panipat
 ye kahana galat he ki islam me kahin bhi kabr ko mattha techne kii ijazat nahin he
 Once a mosque is built then the building collapses, it remains a mosque
 is par justise bobade ki lagaataar namaaz kii shart nahin he? isapar nism pasha ne kaha ki ek aadmi namaaj padhe to bhi masjid rahati he
 It is also wrong to say that sleeping and cooking is not allowed in the mosque, it is a social and cultural place
 jamaat main aane vaale yahaan rukate hai
 Justice Nazir said that this is the Indian version of Islam
 01
 55 PM: On behalf of the Muslim side in the Supreme Court, Nizam Pasha said that the design of the mosque has nothing to do with Sharia
 samprabhu badshaah ke liye tab quran koi kanoon nahin tha
 Therefore, to build Babur's mosque on the criteria of the Quran cannot be called a sin because at that time there was no need to observe every step and work of the king according to Sharia
 01
 12 PM: During the Ayodhya hearing, Ramlala Virajman told the Supreme Court that we will not participate in mediation
 isapar adaalat hi faisla kare
 On this, the Supreme Court said that we are hearing and debate will be held till October 18
 01
 16 PM: During the hearing, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that we are aware of the deadline in this case, if required, the hearing will continue on Saturday
 12
 50 PM: On behalf of the Muslim side, Nizam Pasha said that when Babar was ruling he was sovereign, not accountable to anyone
 usne kanoon or quran ke hisaab se raaj kiya
 Opponent parties say that Babur sinned by building a mosque, but he did not commit any sin
 is dauraan justise bobade ne kaha ki ham yahaan babar ke paap-punya kaa faisla karne nahin baithe hai, ham yahaan kanoonee kabje par daawey kaa pareekshan karne ke liye baithe hai
 12
 40 pm:muslim paksh kii ore se nizam pasha ne adaalat main kaha ki yachika-aitihaasik record ke mutabik, 1885 main nirmohiyon ne imaarat main andar ghuskar puja or kabje kii koshish kii
 The Vairagis captured Rama's platform
 is par adaalat ne kaha ki ye kanoonee masalaa he
 On behalf of the Muslim side, the lawyer said that Babur was on the highest throne at that time, so he ordered to build the mosque
 12
 30 PM: During the hearing on the Ayodhya case, Shekhar Nafade from the Muslim side said that the petition was filed on behalf of the Hindus to build the temple, in which the decision has already been taken
 isliye baar-baar masalaa nahin uthaa sakate hai
 Nizam Pasha is now presenting the plea from the Muslim side
 nizam pasha haji mehboob kii ore se daleel rakh rahe hai
 On behalf of the Muslim side said that the Hindu petitioner has 'shame' in his name, in that case he should not have attachment to the land
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki ham sabhi ko yahaan kanoonee tareekon se aage badhanaa chahie
 11
 20 am:somvaar ko ayodhya cese kii sunwaayee kaa 34waan din he
 On behalf of the Muslim side, senior advocate Shekhar Nafade said that Mahanta did not have the right to worship in Ayodhya, he got this right after 1885
 18 oktober tak khatm hogi sunwaayee?chif justise ranjan gogoi ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kai baar kaha ki is maamle kii sunwaayee samaysima kii deree se chal rahi he, aise main sabhi kii koshish honi chahie ki 18 oktober tak maamle kii sunwaayee khatm ho
 The Chief Justice also said that if the hearing is not over by October 18, the hope of a quick verdict will be over
 isi ke baad se is maamle main faisle kii ummid dikhne lagi he
 Trial is going on in the court to finish the hearing till 18 October, five times a week
 hafte main paanch din is maamle kii sunwaayee jari he, saath hi adaalat main rojaanaa ek ghante adhik vakeelon kii daleelein sun rahi hai
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court has said that if needed, they are ready to hear the case on Saturday as well
 hindu paksh degaa muslim paksh ke javabpichley kuch dinon se muslim paksh apni daleel adaalat main rakh rahaa tha
 First senior lawyer Rajiv Dhawan advocated the Babri Masjid, after which Meenakshi Arora debated the ASI report
 muslim paksh ne ASI report par sawaal khadey kiye or isaki jaanch kii maang kii
 However, the Supreme Court said that there is no real evidence here, everyone is arguing on the basis of the ASI report
 cese se judi kuch ahm batensupreme court main ayodhya cese pichley 60 saal se jari he lekin abhi tak faisla nahin aayaa
 But this time a decisive hearing is being held on the issue

 bihar ke begusarai main shanivaar ko ek dulhan mahilaon kii toli ke saath geet gaate hue chal rahi thi
 Actually, this bride was going to her in-laws' Bharaul village, because her in-laws refused to adopt it
 darasal, priti kii shaadi pichley saal april main bharol gaanv ke dhiraj thakur se hui thi
 He is a teacher in a government school
 dhiraj ke parivaar ne priti ke priti ko apnaane se inkaar kar diya
 They say that the girl's family had forced this marriage
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki dhiraj kaa apharan kar jabadarasti shaadi karwaai gai thi or isliye unhen priti sweekaar nahin he
 For a long time, when Preeti did not get any information from her in-laws and from her husband, she decided to go to Makdampur and forcefully enter the in-laws
 vahaan pahunchate hi sasuraal waalon or pati ne use andar nahin aane diya to vah baahar kii dharne par baith gai
 Preeti said, 'I will die, but will not go back to my parents' house
 ' dulhan kii is anokhi baraat ko dekhne sankadon log ghar ke baahar jamaa ho gaye the
 The local police also deployed security forces outside the house, who were keeping an eye on the entire case
 sthaneey activist ne bhi ladki ke sasuraal waalon ko samajhane kii koshish kii ki isamen ladki kii koi galati nahin he, lekin vah nahin maane
 According to the villagers, the boy's family had also filed a complaint against Preeti's father that the son was forced to marry
 vahiin, priti ke parivaar kaa aarope he ki dhiraj ke parivaar ne paanch lakh rupee or kai mahange saamana kaa dahej maanga or dahej nahin dene par unhone priti ko apnaane se inkaar kar diya
 At the same time, Preity says that she will not back down from her fight

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah regularly conducts roadshows in cities during elections
 bihar kii rajdhani patna ke patna sahib (patna Sahib) sansadeey kshetra main unka road sho shanivaar ko yojit kiya ja rahaa he
 But the path chosen for this road show is clear that the event is being deliberately held to challenge Bihari Babu Shatrughan Sinha (shatrughan Sinha)
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Elections 2019) main shatrughna sinha patna sahib seat se congress or mahagathbandhan ke sanyukt ummidavaar hai
 Giving information about the road show, senior Bihar BJP (BJP) leader and minister Nandkishore Yadav said that this road show of Amit Shah (amit Shah) will begin from the Durga temple at Kadam Kunj in Patna Sahib area
 road sho sahitya sammelan thakur baadi road se ganj hote hue gandhi maidan ke udyog bhawan tak chalegaa
 Although this distance is only two kilometers, but Bihari Babu Shatrughan Sinha has an old connection with this area
 kadam kunj se sinha kaa paitruk ghar kuch hi meter kii duuri par he, jahaan se road sho shuru hoga
 BJP leaders believe that this route of the roadshow has been deliberately chosen so that Shatrughan Sinha can be told about his position
 unhen is baat kaa ahsaas karaayaa jaae ki isse purv do chunaav main unhen jo vot mili the ve bhartiya janata party ke paramparaagat vot the
 The party still has so much power that it can take one vote from the front of their house
 haalanki road sho ke root par shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) ne abhi tak koi pratikriya nahin di he, lekin jab ve namakan karne gaye the tab unhone bhi isi root kaa chayan kiya tha

 For now, i will not tell which party held the meeting

 In Kanpur, a crowd of nearly three lakh people gathered to listen to Modi, among the BJP leaders, there has been a Modi name
 ramamandir andolan ke baad yah pehla mauka tha jab upi main bijepi kii raily main itani badi bheed juty ho
 Kalyan Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Omprakash Singh, former Chief Minister and Independent MP from Etah with Modi, BJP National President Rajnath Singh tried to give a message that there is no contradiction within the party in UP And along with the workers, all the big leaders of the party have pledged to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister
 kanpur kii raily main party netaaon ko is baat kaa sanket mil gaya ki bijepi ab atal-adwani ke yug ko peeche chhod modi yug main pravesh kar chuki he
 Modi's passion was speaking in the Kanpur city of the country called Manchester
 modi jab bolne ke liye khadey hue to ‘ sher aayaa, sher aayaa’ ke joardaar naare lagane lage
 At the rally, the enthusiasm of the youth and slogans of 'modi-modi' were so much that Modi had to stop his speech many times
 sahi myne main dekha jaae to kanpur main modi kii raily bijepi ke liye pratishtha kaa prashn ban gai thi
 The party was in a tizzy with the uncertainty about the venue of the rally
 prashasan se bhi kai baar takaraav hua
 Not only this, the BJP leaders had left no stone unturned to make Modi's election debut vigorous in UP
 yah pradesh ke bijepi netaaon kaa imtahaan bhi tha jisamen philhal ve khare utarate dikhaai de rahe hai
 However, Narendra Modi's efforts to make inroads into Muslims have so far proved to be unsuccessful
 kanpur kii raily main bhi badi sankhya main muslimon kii bheed jutane ke daawey kiye gaye the
 For this, a booklet was distributed in Muslim dominated areas, mentioning the work done by Narendra Modi for the betterment of Muslims in Gujarat, despite the party's 'bismillah' was not better in the Kanpur rally
 kanpur main umade jansailab ke bich muslim chehron kaa na hona bhi charchaa kaa janm de gaya
 This huge rally in Kanpur also highlighted the weaknesses of the BJP
 ramamandir andolan ke samay ek ore jahaan party ke paas sthaneey str par aise vaktaaon kii jamaat thi jo joshilay bhaashanon se logon main utsaah bhar dete the vahiin lagaataar yuvaaon ke bich paith banane kii koshish main juty bijepi ke paas philhal varisht netaaon kii bich aise nae yuva netaaon kii team nahin he jo apane bhaashanon se samaa baandh den
 In Kanpur, the crowd started arriving at the rally venue from 11 pm to listen to Modi and to keep the crowd engaged, the party resorted to parody of film songs in which Modi was praised and Congress was criticized
 pakistani gayak ataullah khan dwaara gaaya gaya gaanaa ‘acha sila diya tuune mere pyaar kaa’ kii tarj par likhaa gaya geet ‘dhokhaa diya sadaa congress aai ne, desh ko lut liya sonia tai ne’ par bheed ne jamkar taaliyaan peetin
 Apart from this, songs like 'sada Chuse Khoon Garib Ka, Congress To Dagbaaz Ray' tried their best to tie the sama at the beginning of the Kanpur rally

 Tejashwi Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition in Bihar, has tweeted that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is the plum
 iske saath hi unhone kaha, ham nitish kumaar ko aise hi ghutane techne par majaboor karte rahenge
 Along with this, Tejashwi tweeted several back to back
 tejasvine likhaa, ''shriman palatimaar ne ek or palati lete hue kaha ki unhone nandan gaanv kii ghatana main DGP ko sabhi ko chhodane ko kaha he
 Why did you have to tell this thing only after Tejashwi's visit to break the 2-week long silence? Awesome! When trapped, they suddenly hit a U-turn like this
 ham aise hi ghutane techne ko majaboor karte rahenge
 Mr
 Paltimar, taking another turn, said that he has asked the DGP to leave everyone in the Nandan village incident
 2 hafto kii lambii chupi tod tejasvi ke daure ke baad hi yah baat kyon bataani padi?gajab he!jab faste he to ye achaanak aise hi U-turn maarthe he
 We will continue to be forced to kneel like this- Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) January 25, 2018 Tejashwi tweeted that, "if Nitish Kumar is such a brilliant scholar and educator of politics, why professional PR agents in his election? Did Hire? Sushil Modi made a serious accusation against you that you had looted thousands of crores of rupees on marketing
 kuch yaad aayaa kursi babu?''tejasvi ne iske alaava do twit or kiye or likhaa, ''nitish kumaar kii ABCD vaali raajnneeti se hamaari “k, kha, ga, gha” vaali raajnneeti lakh guna sahi he
 We don't do conscience politics by selling conscience, policy, principles and ideas like you, conscience babu
 hamaara vichaar adig he
 We do not fight back like you fearing fascism, but fight
 ''tejasvi ne kaha, ''nitish kumaar hatya karenge or dusron kaa dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye kahenge, are, dekho lalu prasad bhrasht he
 Nitish Kumar himself is Bhishma Pitamah of moral / social and political corruption
 inkaa koi stand he kya?lalu yadavake sivaay inke paas bolne ke liye kuch he hi nahin? or naa hi bachaa!'' The government on Tuesday once again made it clear that terrorism has no color, caste or religion, all people are equal in the eyes of law and no law is against any religion
 loksabhaa main basudev acharya, yashavanth sinha, mulaayam singh yadav, saugat raay, sharifuddin shariq ke poorak prashn ke uttar main grih rajya mantri aar pi en singh ne kaha ki kanoon dharm ke aadhaar par kisi ke saath bhedbhaav nahin karata he or maalegaanv cond ke alaava koi aisa maamla saamne nahin aayaa jisamen hiraasat main liye gaye logon ke khilaaf maamla nahin bana ho
 If the members bring up a case in which an innocent person has been caught, then the government will definitely look into it
 singh ne kaha ki gaiyr kanoonee gatividhi rokthaam adhinium (yuapie) ke tahat agar kisi vyakti ke khilaaf 180 dinon ke bheetar aaropapatr daayar nahin kiya jaataa he tab use jamaanat mil jaayegi

 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad kaa koi rang, jati yaa dharm nahin hota he, kanoon kii najar main sabhi log baraabar he or koi kanoon kisi dharm ke khilaaf nahin hota he
 Members of several parties, including the National Conference, were not satisfied with the Minister's reply and demanded a comprehensive discussion on the subject
 tab loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ne kaha ki agar sadsy notice dete hai tab is vishay par alag se charchaa karaayi jaayegi
 The Modi cabinet recommended President's rule in Maharashtra after the election results were not being held in the state
 The government's power struggle in Maharashtra has ended, President's rule has been imposed in the state
 vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi-shivasena mahayuti ko bahumat milane ke baad bhi sarkaar gathan main unki aapas main than gai or donon hi dalon ke raste alag ho gaye
 After this, due to the absence of any majority in the state, there was no government formation in the state since the counting of votes (october 24)
 bijepi or shivasena donon ko rajyapal sarkaar banane ke liye bula chuke hai
 Today was the turn of NCP
 lekin isse pehle hi modi cabinet ne raashtrapati shashan par faisla le liya he or raashtrapati ko sifarish bhej di
 After which President Ram Nath Kovind also approved President's rule in the state
 haalanki raashtrapati shashan lagane ke baad maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ke raste abhi bhi band nahin hue hai
 During presidential rule, if any party goes to the Governor and manages to convince them that they have a sufficient number for a majority
 aise main rajyapal ko yakeen ho jaataa he ki sarkaar gathan ho saktaa he to aisi sthiti main wo raashtrapati shashan ko khatm karne kii sifarish kar sarkaar banane kaa nimantran de sakate hai
 The power struggle of Maharashtra finally came to a halt on President's rule
 yahaan ham aapako yah samajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki kisi bhi rajya main raashtrapati shashan kin paristhitayon main lagata he or iske kya praavdhaan hote hai
 Speaking of Maharashtra, President's rule has been imposed here because no party or coalition has a majority in elections
 raashtrapati shashan kii sanvaidhanik vyavastharashtrapati shashan se jude praavdhaan samvidhan ke anuchhed 356 main die gaye hai
 According to Article 356, the President can impose President's rule in any state if he is satisfied that the State Government is not acting as per various provisions of the Constitution
 aisa jaruri nahin he ki raashtrapati us rajya ke rajyapal kii report ke aadhaar par hi yah faisla len
 This article is a tool that enables the central government to assert its authority over a state government in the event of any civil unrest such as riots that the state government has failed to deal with
 samvidhan main is baat kaa bhi ullekh he kiraashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ke do maheenon ke andar sansad ke donon sadanon dwaara iskaa anumodan kiya janaa jaruri he
 If the Lok Sabha is dissolved in the meantime, it needs to be approved by the new Lok Sabha within one month of its formation after it is approved by the Rajya Sabha
 bahumat ke abhaav main raashtrapati shashanjab kisi sadan main kisi party yaa gathbandhan ke paas spasht bahumat naa ho
 The Governor can keep the House in a 'suspended state' for a period of 6 months
 6 maheene ke baad, yadi phir koi spasht bahumat praapt naa ho to us dasha main pun: chunaav yojit kiye jate hai
 The term of President's rule is approved by both the houses of Parliament, then President's rule will continue for 6 months
 is prakaar 6-6 maah kar ise 3 varsh tak aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Why is it called President's rule? It is called President's rule because, through this, control of the state comes directly under the President of India instead of an elected Chief Minister
 lekin prashasnic drushti se rajya ke rajyapal ko kendriya sarkaar dwaara kaaryakari adhikaar pradaan kiye jate hai
 The governor appoints consultants, who are usually retired civil servants, to help with the administration
 aamtaur par is sthiti main rajya main centre main sattarudh party kii nitiyon kaa anusaran hota he
 What changes happen: The President dissolves the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister
 - raashtrapati, rajya sarkaar ke kaary apane haath main le lete hai or use rajyapal or anya kaaryakari adhikariyon kii shaktiyaan praapt ho jaati hai
 - The Governor of the state runs the state in the name of the President with the assistance of the Secretary of State or with the assistance of an advisor appointed by the President
 yahi kaaran he ki anuchhed 356 ke antargat kii gai ghoshnaa ko raashtrapati shashan kaha jaataa he
 - The President may declare that Parliament shall exercise the powers of the State legislature
 - sansad hi rajya ke vidheyak or bajet prastaav ko paarit karti he
 - Parliament reserves the right to make laws for the state to the President or any of his nominated officers
 - jab sansad nahin chal rahi ho to raashtrapati, 'anuchhed 356 shasit rajya' ke liye koi adhyadesh jari kar saktaa he
 Retired chairman of Tata group Ratan Tata has said that the economic problem has deepened due to lack of leadership in the country
 unhone kaha ki desh par se duniya kaa bharosa uth gaya he

 The subjects went to the king and had their problem
 raja to is sthiti ko lekar pehle se hi dukhi the
 They started thinking that what kind of sin have i committed, which i am getting punished in this way? Then, with the aim of finding some means to get rid of this suffering, the king took the army and went towards the forest
 vahaan ghoomte-ghoomte ek din ve brahmaji ke putr angira rishi ke ashram main pahunche or unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Rishiwar sought to know the reason for coming to the forest and his ashram
 tab raja ne haath jodakar kaha- 'mahatman! sabhi prakaar se dharm kaa paalan karata hua bhi main apane rajya main praja ko sukhi nahin dekh paa rahaa hum
 After all, why is this happening, please resolve it

 While wandering there, one day he reached the ashram of Brahma's son Angira Rishi and prostrated him
 rishiver ne jangal main or apane ashram main aane kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha
 Then the king folded his hands and said- 'mahatma! Even following religion in all ways, i am not able to see people happy in my state
 aakhir kis kaaran se aisa ho rahaa he, kripaya iskaa samaadhaan karen
 Hearing this, Maharishi Angira said- 'O Rajan! This is the best era of all ages

 bihar main spidi trial main kami aane par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne chintaa jataai he
 In 2005, when the Nitish Kumar government came to power, the rule of law was established in Bihar through the speedy trial
 lekin in 12 varshon main kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 Now questions are being raised about law and order
 aise main uske peeche kii vajah spidi trial main kami aane ko bataaya ja rahaa he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said in a seminar on Effective Investigation, Speedy Trial and Timely Justice that if the Rule of Law in Bihar is stabilized then the judiciary will have the biggest role in it
 unhone kaha ki loktantric vyavastha ke prati logon kaa bharosa or vishwaas kaayam rahanaa chahie
 For this, the Legislator, Judiciary and Executive Body discharge their respective responsibilities on their own, which makes it possible
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki us samay bihar kii jo sthiti thi, sabko maaloom he
 There was no trial on the deadline
 apradhi chhot jate the
 There was no fear of law

 lekin baad main yah sankhya ghatane lagi or saal 2016 main isaki sankhya ghatakar maatr 5,508 ho gai
 It is clear from the data that from 2006 to 2010, how much effort was made to establish the rule of law in Bihar
 iskaa asar bhi us samay dikhne laga tha
 Nitish Kumaraka was the first term and people started to feel that the rule of law was established in Bihar
 lekin duusare turm main spidi trial yaa aparaadhiyon ko sajaa dilaane main kami aane lagi
 In 2010, Nitish Kumar and the BJP won a landslide victory in the Legislative Assembly and this massive victory in a way weakened the serious action against criminals in Bihar
 phir saal 2013 mennithish kumarabijepi se alag ho gaye
 In 2015, he won elections in association with Lalu Prasad Yadav and now again there is a government in Bihar with BJP

 sawaal tha kya dow
 Zakir Fidayin justifies the attack? Dr
 zakir ne nirdosh or masuumon ko maarane kii to majammat kii lekin deshhit main yuddh ke maidan par fidain hamale ko jaij bataaya
 The religious leader, who gave a long debate on Fidayin and the terrorist attacks, kept silence on the questions related to education and problems of Indian Muslims
 sawaal ko sandarbh se hatakar bataaya
 Whereas all Muslims should become terrorists and accused the media of showing their statements in half and inaccurate context, taking the media into the dock on allegations of not condemning Osama bin Laden
 khud ko aatank ke khilaaf dikhaane ke liye doctor ne aatanki sanghathan islamki state kii ye kahkar ninda kii ki wo islamic nahin anti islamic he

 The Supreme Court reprimanded the UP government for planting trees in the Taj Protected Area, ie TTZ
 court ne kaha ki is maamle main jarurat padi to doshi afasaron ko jail bhej diya jayega
 The court said that despite the order, government officials did not plant trees and it seems that the crop of corruption in this area is blooming
 court ne upi sarkaar se doshi afasaron par karrwai karne or is maamle main rodmap ke saath aane ke aadesh die hai
 In fact, in the Taj region, the UP government harvested trees to widen the road
 is maamle main supreme court ne sarkaar ko aadesh diya tha ki ek ped ke badale das guna ped ilaake main lagaae jaaen
 In this case, the UP government said in the first affidavit filed in the Supreme Court that 45 thousand trees have been planted in the area
 duusare halafname main inaki sankhya 15 hajaar bataai gai
 The Supreme Court had ordered the committee of advocate ADN Rao to go and inspect the spot
 aath farvari ko cameti ne puure ilaake kii jaanch kii or apni report supreme court ko saunpi
 The report said that only about five thousand trees have been planted in the area
 lekin saath hi ye bhi kaha gaya ki sarkaar ne inaki dekhbhaal karne ke liye bhi intjaam nahin kiye gaye hai
 In the hearing held on Monday, Justice TS Thakur expressed his displeasure and said that it seems that no officer wants to work and the court orders also do not care about the officers
 court ne kaha ki vah aise adhikariyon ko jail main daal sakate hai or maamle kii jaanch sibiai se kara sakate hai
 The court said that it seems as if the crop of corruption is blooming at the place of planting trees and the funds received for it have been dubbed by the officers
 haalanki is dauraan upi sarkaar ke vakil ne court se maafee maangate hue kaha ki pehle or duusare halafname main jo pedo kii sankhya bataai gai wo galati se hui he or isliye ek or halafanama daakhil kiya gaya he
 The Supreme Court has ordered that an inquiry should be conducted against the guilty officers in this case and the UP government again comes to the Supreme Court with a roadmap

 jiesti lagu hone ke baad bahut se logon ko is baat kii chintaa he ki jin chizon par jiesti kam hui he, uskaa phayda graahakon ko milegaa bhi yaa nahin
 The reason for this is that a lot of stock of all packaged goods, including food and drink, is already present in the market and MRP printed before the implementation of GST
 nai emarpy kaa steekar lagaana jarurigin chizon par tex kam hua he niyamon ke mutabik unki keemat kam honi chahie

 He said that his ministry is going to start a helpline very soon where customers can complain that after GST reduction, the price on anything was not reduced
 paswan ne kaha ki aisi sari shikayaton par karrwai kii jaaegi
 Exemption of stickers to companies by September 1: The instructions given by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs regarding the new MRP says that if anything has happened on the GSTTM, then stick the second MRP sticker with the new lower price so that the customers are clean- Know clearly that prices have come down
 lekin agar kisi cheez kii keemat main badhotaree hui he, to companiyon ko do akhabaaron main ishtehaar chhapakar bataanaa hoga ki in chizon par jiesti badhane se inaki keemat bad gai hai
 Companies will get a discount on sticker for selling old goods till 1 September
 uske baad sabhi saamaanon par jiesti ke hisaab se nai keemat kii emarpy chhapni hogi
 Preparing to discontinue different mrps for the same thing: The Ministry of Consumer has also taken further steps to completely close different mrps for the same thing

 According to the rules, it was wrong to do so earlier, but now the ministry has made clear rules about it, which will be implemented from January 1 next year

 shah ke mukaable rajnath singh ko kam aankane ke sawaal par bebaak raikisi ko kamatar yaa focus karne kaa kaam media karata he-chintamaniraksha mantri rajnath singh ke bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pramukh rahete hue narendra modi pehali baar pradhanmantri bane
 The BJP, led by Rajnath Singh, succeeded in forming a government with an absolute majority at the Center for the first time, but Amit Shah is called 'chanakya' while Rajnath Singh was deprived of this reputation
 aisa kyon hua? sahitya ajtak ke manch par ravivaar ko amit shah or rajnath singh kii biography likhane vaale lekhakon ne is raaj ko saajha kiya
 Gautam Chintamani, author of 'politics: a Biography of Rajnath Singh', expressed his opinion on the question of undermining Rajnath Singh more than Amit Shah
 amit shah ko achaanak 'chanakya' kaha jane laga lekin rajnath singh ke bijepi pramukh rahete narendra modi pradhanmantri bane, lekin unhen 'chanakya' nahin kaha jaataa he
 On this question, Gautam Chinti Mani says that everyone knows that BJP is a cadre based party
 yahaan aglaa party adhyaksh koun hone vaala he, iske bare main kisi ko pataa nahin he

 Gautam Chintamani said that the big leaders of BJP have done a big job on which the book can be written
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki rajnath singh ko kamatar aanka gaya
 This kind of perception has been created by the media
 ye tag janata detii he
 The situation in which Amit Shah is seen right now is many years of hard work
 kisi ko kamatar dekhnaa yaa kisi par focus karnaa hamaari vajah se hota he
 What did the writer say on the 'strong condemnation' associated with Rajnath Singh, he said that the mass leader has his own way of connecting with the people
 log rajnath singh ko lekar mujhase kai tarah ke sawaal karte hai
 Rajnath Singh is very much asked about the tag of 'strong condemnation'
 main yah bataanaa chahta hum ki netaa kya kahata or vah kya karata he yah mahatvapurn he
 Right now we are talking about Narendra Modi and Amit Shah here but the real thing is that all these people are influenced and working by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 lekin shyama prasad mukherjee ko koi nahin jaanata he
 There are very few leaders whose biography reveals India
 rajnath singh ke jivan kaa adhyayan karte hue maine paaya ki ye sirf netaaon kii kahani nahin, balki ye ek daur kii kahani he

 How honest is it written in politics and how honestly do leaders pull each other's feet? Dr
 who wrote Amit Shah's biography
 anirbaan ganguli ne kaha ki koun chanakya he or koun nahin he, yah media kaa khadaa kiya hua mudda he
 As Amit Shah proved in Gujarat, the party remains in power
 saalon se sabit kiya, phir jaakar rajnath singh ne hi amit shah ko uttar pradesh kaa general secretary niyukt kiya
 There is no sudden (chanakya made) here, nor is there any less

 Petrol price has been increased by 28 paise per liter
 jabaki dijal ke daam main 6 paise kii kami kii gai he
 This step has been taken in view of the change in oil prices in the international market
 do maheene main yah lagaataar teesraa mauka he jab petrol ke daam badaye gaye hai
 In the case of diesel, the price has been reduced for the second time this month

 With the system that should be trusted from day one, the relationship of these youth begins with mistrust
 yahi anubhav jab use medical or ejineering ke imtahaan ke vakt hota hoga to uskaa yakeen gaharaa ho jaataa hoga ki is desh main kuch bananaa he to yahi tarika he
 Maybe this is also a reason for frustration
 isliye hamen isaki maang kerani hi chahie ki bharat main imtahaan kaa system aisa he jisamen koi send na laga sake
 The board has exams every year
 media main tarah tarah kii khabaren chhapati hai
 There is more discussion about one state and not the rest, so if you take out the news of all the states, then you see a bigger problem

 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system

 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student

 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in

 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined

 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi

 The CBI has also conducted raids at many places
 2003 main ames kii pariksha ko lekar bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The main accused Ranjit Dawn will remember the name which leaked the question papers of Bank, Engineering, Medical
 kai bade log uske client hote the jo apane bacchon ko paise ke dam par doctor ejeeniyar bana dena chaahate the
 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal

 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 har saal board ke imtahaan hote hai
 Various types of news are published in the media
 ek rajya ko lekar zyaada charchaa hoti he, baaki kii nahin isliye agar aap sabhi rajyon kii khabaron ko nikaal kar denkhen to zyaada badi samasya kaa darshan karte hai
 The image of the Indian examination system that is created by these reports is not good
 maharashtra, kerala, bengal, madhya pradesh rajasthan, bihar, himachal pradesh,haryana, tamilnadu, urisa or jammu-kashmir kii khabaren bataati hai ki parche li hote hai, li hone kii afvaah bhi udati he or imtahaan radd hote hai
 In March this year, when the board was examining in Maharashtra, the newspapers were writing that the question paper had been leaked for the third consecutive year
 marathi kaa prashn patr li ho gaya
 As of March 14, 2017, India Today reported that the Math Form of 12th was leaked on a mobile phone
 hindustan times ne to hedline banaai he ki echechasi kii pariksha ke paanch dinon main paanch parche li ho gaye
 The Indian Express dated 16 March 2017 reported from Shimla that the Himachal Board has canceled the papers of Physics and Computer Science of class 12 due to reports of paper leaks

 Topper of Bihar Board had pushed the subject
 bihar kii pariksha main vivaad 2016 main bhi rahaa
 In Orissa, the students locked the teacher in the room for not copying
 jammu-kashmir main is saal farvari main 10veen kii science pariksha main nakal kii itani khabar ai ki kuch kendron par radd kerani pad gai
 This year, when the officials were upset with the news of the form being leaked on the first day of the twelfth exam in Rajasthan, it was later learned that it was rumored
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal
 telegraph ne likhaa he ki adhikari kehete hai ki parchaa li nahin hua he magar whats par jo prashn patr gum rahaa he wo physical science kaa hi prashn patr he
 Mathematics paper of class x was out in April 2017
 pariksha radd hui or jaanch ke aadesh die gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the paper of Chemistry and Physics was also rumored to be on Whats Up
 bataaiye gyaarah rajyon kii board parikshaon kaa ye haal he
 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam , then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 Reports from Maharashtra, Kerala, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir state that leaflets are leaked, rumors of them leaking also fly and examinations are canceled
 isi saal march main maharashtra main jab board imtahaan ho rahe the to akhbaar likh rahe the ki lagaataar tisare varsh prashn patr li hua he

 16 march 2017 ke indian express main shimla se khabar chhapi he ki paper li kii khabaron ke kaaran himachal board ne 12veen ke physics, computer science ke paper radd kar diye hai
 Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had to give a statement on the theft of question papers in the assembly
 sadan ko bataaya he ki ek skool kaa dabl lock todaa gaya or har vishay ke 60 prashn patr gaayab paae gaye
 In 2015, the entire nation was shocked by this photo copied in Vidya Niketan, Vaishali district of Bihar
 bihar board kii topper ne vishay ko jhakzor diya tha
 The controversy in Bihar's examination was also in 2016
 urisa main nakal na karne dene par chaatro ne teacher ko hi kamare main band kar diya
 In Jammu and Kashmir, in February this year, there was so much news of cheating in the science examination of class 10 that some centers had to be canceled

 In 2015, the form of mathematics was leaked in Tamil Nadu, four teachers were also arrested
 bengal main isi saal march kii madhyamik pariksha main physical science kaa parchaa li hone kii baat adhikariyon ne maan lee
 The Telegraph has written that the officials say that the form has not been leaked but the question paper which is circulating on Whats is the question paper of Physical Science
 april 2017 main dasvin class kaa ganit kaa paper out ho gaya
 The examination was canceled and orders for investigation were given
 madhyapradesh main chemistry or physics kaa parchaa bhi whats ap par aane kii afvaah udi thi
 Tell this is the condition of the board examinations of eleven states
 agar paper li hona akhil bhartiya samasya he to ise dur karne kii guarantee har rajya ko deni chahie
 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system
 main nahin kah rahaa ki akhbaar main li hone kii khabar chhapi he wo sabhi sahi hai, ho saktaa he na ho lekin har saal in khabaron kaa laut aana bataata he ki chori karaane vaale giroh pariksha kendron ke aasapaas hi rahete hai
 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined
 kapade utaravakar jaanch hui
 Clothes were given to Qatar
 kerala kii ghatana he magar chori na ho, koi nakal na kar sake iske liye aisi checking hui ki vaaki sabko laga hoga ki unke saath dhokhaa nahin hoga
 Now copying is over
 baqayda dress code jari hua ki pariksha kender par kaise pahunchnaa he
 Kannur in Kerala is a bit much, but the students are waiting for an exam system that can be trusted blindly
 neet piji kaa haal to dekh liya aapane, ab akhabaaron kii khabaron main neet under grugeet pariksha kaa haal dekhiye
 Patna Police is waiting for the permission of CBSE so that the trunk in which the question papers were brought can be forensic examined
 7 may ko patna ke 32 or gaya ke 20 par neet kii pariksha yojit kii gai thi
 Police claim that he foiled an attempt to leak the question paper
 is silsile main kai logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 You can see the Times of India of 41 May 2017
 patna ke dainik jaagran main ek din pehle panne par khabar chhapati he ki sargana se teen karod kii deal hui thi pariksha paas karaane ke liye
 a news headline states that there are five gangs who take a guarantee of passing in 20 lakhs
 kai jagah se aisi bhi khabaren chhapi hai ki paisa lekar centaron ne thaga kai abhyarthiyon ko, 145 kii jagah 120 prashnon ke hi uttar uplabdh karaae
 The Goa Police is investigating the NEET UG examination conducted in May this year, the ATS of Rajasthan and the Patna Police
 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi
 Anand Rai is the petitioner in this case and Prashant Bhushan is the lawyer
 16 agast ko agali sunwaayee he
 The CBI has also conducted raids at many places
 2003 main ames kii pariksha ko lekar bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The main accused Ranjit Dawn will remember the name which leaked the question papers of Bank, Engineering, Medical
 kai bade log uske client hote the jo apane bacchon ko paise ke dam par doctor ejeeniyar bana dena chaahate the
 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal
 31 oktober tak sibiai se kaha gaya he ki sabhi cese main chargeshit file kerani he
 More than 200 firs have been registered in Vyapam case

 2000 were also arrested
 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 isi saal march main maharashtra main jab board imtahaan ho rahe the to akhbaar likh rahe the ki lagaataar tisare varsh prashn patr li hua he

 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked

 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined

 a news headline states that there are five gangs who take a guarantee of passing in 20 lakhs

 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi

 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal
 31 oktober tak sibiai se kaha gaya he ki sabhi cese main chargeshit file kerani he
 More than 200 firs have been registered in Vyapam case

 2000 were also arrested
 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 16 march 2017 ke indian express main shimla se khabar chhapi he ki paper li kii khabaron ke kaaran himachal board ne 12veen ke physics, computer science ke paper radd kar diye hai
 Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had to give a statement on the theft of question papers in the assembly
 sadan ko bataaya he ki ek skool kaa dabl lock todaa gaya or har vishay ke 60 prashn patr gaayab paae gaye
 In 2015, the entire nation was shocked by this photo copied in Vidya Niketan, Vaishali district of Bihar
 bihar board kii topper ne vishay ko jhakzor diya tha
 The controversy in Bihar's examination was also in 2016
 urisa main nakal na karne dene par chaatro ne teacher ko hi kamare main band kar diya
 In Jammu and Kashmir, in February this year, there was so much news of cheating in the science examination of class 10 that some centers had to be canceled
 is saal jab rajasthan main barahavin pariksha ke pehle din hi parchaa li hone kii khabaron se adhikari pareshaan ho gaye, baad main pataa chalaa ki afvaah thi
 In 2015, the form of mathematics was leaked in Tamil Nadu, four teachers were also arrested
 bengal main isi saal march kii madhyamik pariksha main physical science kaa parchaa li hone kii baat adhikariyon ne maan lee
 The Telegraph has written that the officials say that the form has not been leaked but the question paper which is circulating on Whats is the question paper of Physical Science
 april 2017 main dasvin class kaa ganit kaa paper out ho gaya
 The examination was canceled and orders for investigation were given
 madhyapradesh main chemistry or physics kaa parchaa bhi whats ap par aane kii afvaah udi thi
 Tell this is the condition of the board examinations of eleven states
 agar paper li hona akhil bhartiya samasya he to ise dur karne kii guarantee har rajya ko deni chahie
 a culture of honest system cannot exist without an honest examination system
 main nahin kah rahaa ki akhbaar main li hone kii khabar chhapi he wo sabhi sahi hai, ho saktaa he na ho lekin har saal in khabaron kaa laut aana bataata he ki chori karaane vaale giroh pariksha kendron ke aasapaas hi rahete hai
 After each examination, the group of students is divided into two classes
 ek jisane nakal nahin kii, doosraa jisane nakal kii
 The tradition of being considered smart by imitators should stop
 dasvin or barahavin kii pariksha ke baad medilak pravesh pariksha kii khabaron ko khangaalane baitha to sthiti utani hi bhayanak nazar ain
 The students preparing for medicine strangulate their bones, how much money the parents spend, and how helpless they will find themselves when they know that NEET has been rigged
 agar ek chaatr bhi vyapam ke tareeke se admician paa jaae to yah sainkadon eemaandaar chaatro ke saath ninsaphi he
 How can we be normal about these news stories? har saal jab 19-20 saal ke ladke chori or dhaandhlee kii shikaayat lekar dilli ke media house ke baahar bhatakate milte hai to unhen dekhakar dukh hota he
 Why can't we demand a full proof examination system from the government
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in

 There is a great lack of transparency
 2015 main bihar ke vaishali zile vidya niketan main nakal kii is tasviir se puraa desh sadame main aa gaya tha
 Topper of Bihar Board had pushed the subject
 bihar kii pariksha main vivaad 2016 main bhi rahaa
 In Orissa, the students locked the teacher in the room for not copying
 jammu-kashmir main is saal farvari main 10veen kii science pariksha main nakal kii itani khabar ai ki kuch kendron par radd kerani pad gai
 This year, when the officials were upset with the news of the form being leaked on the first day of the twelfth exam in Rajasthan, it was later learned that it was rumored
 2015 main tamilnadu main ganit kaa parchaa li ho gaya, chaar shikshak bhi giraftaar kiye gaye
 Officials accepted the leak of the physical science paper in the secondary examination in March this year in Bengal
 telegraph ne likhaa he ki adhikari kehete hai ki parchaa li nahin hua he magar whats par jo prashn patr gum rahaa he wo physical science kaa hi prashn patr he
 Mathematics paper of class x was out in April 2017
 pariksha radd hui or jaanch ke aadesh die gaye
 In Madhya Pradesh, the paper of Chemistry and Physics was also rumored to be on Whats Up
 bataaiye gyaarah rajyon kii board parikshaon kaa ye haal he
 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money

 You can see the Times of India of 41 May 2017

 a news headline states that there are five gangs who take a guarantee of passing in 20 lakhs
 kai jagah se aisi bhi khabaren chhapi hai ki paisa lekar centaron ne thaga kai abhyarthiyon ko, 145 kii jagah 120 prashnon ke hi uttar uplabdh karaae
 The Goa Police is investigating the NEET UG examination conducted in May this year, the ATS of Rajasthan and the Patna Police
 anand raay ne jab dilli police ko shikaayat kii to maukhik jawaab mila ki abhi neet pi ji kii jaanch main hi itnaa vyast hai ki neet yuji kii jaanch main utana dhyaan dena sambhav nahin he
 The examination system of NEET MBBS and NEET PG is not completely theft free
 system aisa hona chahie ki afvaah kii bhi guzaaish na rahe or koi kisi ko thag nahin paae
 Seeing the clipping of newspapers, it seemed that gangs have their own system in this state for this test
 ye tab he jab isi tarah se vyapam ghotaalaa hua tha
 Even AIIMS entrance examination becomes suspicious
 isi 15 june ko sibiai ne ames embibies kaa prashn patr li hone ke aarope main maamla darj kiya he
 The examination took place on 28 May
 dilli hai court ne centre sarkaar, ames or sibiai ko ames paper li ke maamle main states report maangi thi
 Anand Rai is the petitioner in this case and Prashant Bhushan is the lawyer
 16 agast ko agali sunwaayee he
 The CBI has also conducted raids at many places
 2003 main ames kii pariksha ko lekar bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The main accused Ranjit Dawn will remember the name which leaked the question papers of Bank, Engineering, Medical
 kai bade log uske client hote the jo apane bacchon ko paise ke dam par doctor ejeeniyar bana dena chaahate the
 The CBI was investigated
 100 karod kaa dhandha tha yah
 After 2003, CBI is again examining the AIIMS examination in 2017
 tippaniyan i know that these questions are not as important as the false accusations of politicians, but think that by paying money, become a doctor without studying and start treating you
 baat sirf doctor banane kaa nahin he, sarkaar ne janata kaa paisa ek aise chaatr par kharch kiya jo paise dekar chori ke raste se doctor bana he
 Once he becomes a doctor by way of theft, how will he follow the morality of the doctor
 is desh main raajnneetik kaarnon se vyapam ghotaale par thik se bahes nahin hui lekin honi chahie thi
 The Supreme Court has asked the CBI to quickly file the charge sheet in all cases and submit the hard disk report to the CBI Trial Court of Bhopal
 31 oktober tak sibiai se kaha gaya he ki sabhi cese main chargeshit file kerani he
 More than 200 firs have been registered in Vyapam case

 2000 were also arrested
 vyapam kaa bhanda to foot gaya magar kahin aisa na ho ki neet ko lekar bhi is tarah kaa ghotaalaa ho rahaa ho
 The Hindu newspaper reported 4 April 2017
 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 bataaiye gyaarah rajyon kii board parikshaon kaa ye haal he
 If paper leakage is a pan-india problem, then every state should be guaranteed to remove it
 eemaandaar pariksha pranali ke bagair eemaandaar vyavastha kii samskruti ban hi nahin sakati he
 i am not saying that the news of the leaks has been published in the newspapers, they are all right, may or may not happen, but the return of these reports every year suggests that the gangs who steal are around the examination centers
 har imtahaan ke baad chaatro kaa samooh do virgon main bant jaataa he
 One who did not copy, the other who copied
 nakal karne waalon ko smart samajhane kii parampara par roak lagani chahie
 After the tenth and twelfth exams Medilak sat looking at the news of the entrance examination, the situation looked equally terrible
 medical kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatr apni haddi galaa dete hai, maa baap kaa kitna paisa karch hota he, or jab inhen pataa chalata hoga ki neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee hui he, to wo khud ko kitna asahaay pate honge
 If a student also gets admission through Vyapam, then it is unfair to have hundreds of honest students
 ham kaise in khabaron ko lekar saamaanya ho sakate hai
 Every year when 19-20 year old boys are found wandering outside the media house of Delhi with complaints of theft and rigging, they are sad to see them
 ham kyon nahin sarkaar se ek phul pruf pariksha pranali kii maang kar sakate hai
 How would you explain to an honest student that someone became a doctor by paying money? phir compatishan kaa kya matlab he
 After these reports, action was taken against any officer related to NEET examination
 isaki koi khabar hamaare haath nahin lagi
 After collecting these headlines in different newspapers, it is found that there is a possibility of break in the medical entrance examination
 shaatir logon ke giroh har saal aate hai or kisi mehnatee chaatr kaa haq uda le jate hai
 Can we not have an honest and reliable examination system in which not a single student is cheated? 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the

 madhyapradesh vidhaan sabha main sieji kii ek report rakhi gai
 It said that the state government had not kept proper regulatory framework for the examinations, due to which the future of the candidates was spoiled
 vyapam ek vibhaag he,niamak sanstha nahin he
 Officers were appointed keeping rules in mind
 sarkaar ne ye bhi data nahin rakhaa kitni parikshaayen hui hai
 There is a great lack of transparency
 ek eemaandaar chaatr ko aap kaise samajhaayenge ki paisa dekar koi doctor ban gaya
 Then what is the meaning of competition? kya in khabaron ke baad neet pariksha se jude kisi adhikari ke khilaaf karrwai hui
 We did not get any news about it
 alag-alag akhabaaron ke ye hedline ek jagah jamaa kar dekhne par pataa chalata he ki medical pravesh pariksha main send kii guzaaish lagati he
 Gangs of vicious people come every year and take away the rights of any hardworking student
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or bharosemand pariksha pranali nahin mil sakati jisamen ek bhi chaatr ke saath dhokhaa na ho
 The US company, which has been contracted to conduct the post-graduate examination of the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET), appeared in a news paper on 26 July, believed that one could hack the exam system
 kya sarkaar se yah sawaal poochna thik hoga ki jab bharat ek saath 108 upgrah antariksh main bhej saktaa he to kya medical pravesh pariksha khud yojit nahin kar saktaa he
 Are the examinations also started from private agencies? phir li hone kii javabdehi kiski hogi, kaise bharosa paidaa hoga ki privet company ne kisi ke saath sauda nahin kiya hoga
 The charge sheet of the Delhi Police Crime Branch Central Range shows that the Delhi Police has investigated Chandigarh and Noida Center, have done a good investigation, but if a similar investigation was conducted across the country, then how much would have broken and how much trust
 pehle neet pariksha ke system ko samajhiye
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai
 These are the three lakh students who have studied five years of medical education
 piji ke liye kareeb 25000 seat hoti hai jinamein se das gyaarah hazaar hi sarkari hote hai
 Doing PG from private colleges is a game of crores, so every doctor prepares for the government seat
 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center

 26 july ke akhabaaron main ek khabar chhapi, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) kii post graduate pariksha yojit karne ke liye jis amareeki company ko theka diya gaya he, usne mana he ki pariksha ke system ko koi hack kar saktaa he
 Would it be right to ask the government the question that when India can simultaneously send 108 satellites into space, then it cannot conduct medical entrance examination itself
 kya parikshaayen bhi privet agenciyon se hone lagi hai
 Then who will be responsible for the leak, how will there be confidence that the private company will not deal with anyone
 dilli police krime branch central range kii chargeshit se pataa chalata he ki dilli police ne chandigarh or noida centre kii jaanch kii, acchhee jaanch kii he, magar isi tarah kii jaanch agar desh bhar main ho jaati to jane kitne bharam tuutate or kitna bharosa
 First, understand the system of NEET exam
 neshnal igzamination board neet kii pariksha yojit karata he
 Undergraduate and post graduate exams are under NEET
 under graduate neet pariksha main 10-11 lakh chaatr shaamil hote hai
 The Post Graduate NEET Exam consists of close to three lakh students
 ye teen lakh wo chaatr hai jo paanch saal kii medical padhai pard chuke hote hai
 There are about 25000 seats for PG, out of which only eleven thousand are government
 privet kalejon se piji karnaa karodon kaa khel he isliye har doctor sarkari seat ke liye taiyaari karata he
 Out of 10-11000 PG seats in the government, only 6-7000 are clinical, ie in which you can practice
 ek ek seat ke liye maaramaari hoti he
 The doctor starts preparing for PG from the very first year i
e
 after taking admission in the medical college
 jab use yah pataa chale ki isamen bhi kuch log agent sab agent ke zariye unki mehnat par daaka daal rahe hai to ve kitne hataash hote honge
 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate
 ummidavaar milte hi The sub agent used to tell his senior agent
 senior agent mata pita yaa chaatr ke sampark main aa jaataa he
 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune
 Where the authorities can help him in counterfeiting
 pariksha yojit karne vaali company police ko us software ke bare main nahin bataa saki jiske sahare pariksha ko hack kiya gaya he
 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route
 jis pariksha pranali par lakhon chaatro or unke pariwaron par itnaa bharosa he wo bharosa tutaa kaise
 Because of which
 is maamle ko uthaane vaale anand raay kaa daawa he ki amareeki company ko bina tender ke hi pariksha yojit karne kaa theka de diya gaya
 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years
 is baar jab embibies ke liye neet kii pariksha ke liye chaatr chatraayen pariksha kender pahunte to unki sakhti se jaanch kii gai
 The investigation took place after removing the clothes
 kapade katar diye gaye
 There is an incident in Kerala but there is no theft, no one can copy it, for this, there was such a check that everyone must have felt that they will not be cheated
 ab nakal khatm
 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake
 You have seen the condition of NEET PG, now see the condition of NEET undergraduate exam in newspaper news
 patna police sibiesai kii anumati kaa intazaar kar rahi he taaki jis trunk main prashn patr laae gaye unki forencik jaanch ho sake
 On May 7, NEET examination was conducted on 32 of Patna and 20 of Gaya
 police kaa daawa he ki usne prashn patr li karne kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 Many people were arrested in this connection
 aap 41 may 2017 kaa times of india dekh sakate hai
 a day before in Patna's Dainik Jagran, news appears on the page that a deal of three crores was made with the kingpin to pass the exam
 ek khabar ke hedline main kaha gaya he ki paanch giroh hai jo 20 lakh main paas karaane kii guarantee lete hai
 There have also been reports from many places that by taking money, the centers duped many candidates by providing answers to 120 questions instead of 145
 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner
 yahaan tak ki ames kii pravesh pariksha bhi sandigdh ho jaati he
 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI
 anand raay is maamle main yachika karta hai or prashanth bhushan vakil hai
 The next hearing is on August 16
 sibiai ne kai jagahon par chhapemari bhi kii he
 In 2003, a big scam came out regarding AIIMS examination
 mukhya aaropee ranjit don kaa naam yaad hoga jo bank, ejineering, medical ke prashn patr li karata tha
 Many older people were his clients, who wanted to engineer their children on the basis of money
 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The comments mujhe pataa he ki ye sawaal netaaon ke bekaar ke aarope pratyarope jitne mahatvapurn nahin hai lekin sochiye ki paisa dekar bina padhai ke koi doctor ban jaae or aapkaa ilaaj karne lage
 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie
 Till 31 October, the CBI has been asked to file a chargesheet in all the cases
 vyapam maamle main 200 se adhik exiaar darj he
 Anand Rai says that 2500 accused were made
 2000 giraftaar bhi hue the
 Vyapam's Bhanda broke out, but it should not happen that such a scam is happening about Neet
 hindu akhbaar kii report he 4 april 2017 kii
 a report of CAG was kept in Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 isamen kaha gaya ki rajya sarkaar ne parikshaon ke liye uchit regulatory fremawork rakhaa hi nahin jisaki vajah se ummidavaaron kaa bhavishya kharaab hua
 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 The National Examination Board conducts the examination of NEET
 under graduate or post graduate kii pariksha neet ke tahat hoti he
 Undergraduate NEET exam consists of 10-11 lakh students
 post graduate neet pariksha main teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr shaamil hote hai

 sarkaar kii 10-11000 piji seat main se 6-7000 hi clinical hoti he yani jisamen aap practice kar sakate hai
 There is a fight for each seat
 doctor medical kalege main admician lete hi yani pehle hi saal se pi ji kii taiyaari shuru kar detaa he
 When he comes to know that some people in this too, agents are trying to rob him of his hard work through all agents, then how desperate they must be
 disambar 2016 main hui pi ji neet kii pariksha main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat par dilli police ne jaanch shuru kii to kai aisi baaten saamne ai hai jo hairaan karne vaali hai
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose
 is sambandh main dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Delhi Police has also arrested four people
 chandigarh or noida ke pariksha kendron ke do suparviser ne kuch chaatro kii madad kii he
 The server through which the examination was being conducted was hacked and helped
 poochtacha ke dauraan police ko pataa laga ki pariksha ke liye Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd ko theka diya gaya he
 According to the chargesheet, the company signed an agreement with CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd to provide engineers and site supervisors and other staff to prepare the exam lab
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part
 indian express kii ek khabar ke mutabik is raste se koi 200 chaatro ke paas hone kii ashanka he
 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in
 kiski vajah se
 Anand Rai, who took up the case, claims that the American company was given the contract to conduct the examination without tender
 anand raay hi lagaataar do teen saal se yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 This time when the students reached the examination center for NEET exams for MBBS, they were strictly examined
 kapade utaravakar jaanch hui
 Clothes were given to Qatar
 kerala kii ghatana he magar chori na ho, koi nakal na kar sake iske liye aisi checking hui ki vaaki sabko laga hoga ki unke saath dhokhaa nahin hoga
 Now copying is over
 baqayda dress code jari hua ki pariksha kender par kaise pahunchnaa he
 Kannur in Kerala is a bit much, but the students are waiting for an exam system that can be trusted blindly
 neet piji kaa haal to dekh liya aapane, ab akhabaaron kii khabaron main neet under grugeet pariksha kaa haal dekhiye
 Patna Police is waiting for the permission of CBSE so that the trunk in which the question papers were brought can be forensic examined

 On the complaint of rigging in PG NEET examination held in December 2016, Delhi Police started investigation, many such things have come to the fore
 piji neet kii pariksha kaa theka america kii ek company prometric ko diya gaya
 This company has told the police that its software may be tampered with
 police jaanch kar rahi thi ki pariksha kaa software hack ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 The 20-page charge sheet has dangerous stories ranging from hacking to fixing
 chargeshit he, dosha sabit nahin hua he
 We are trying to understand the examination system under the pretext of this charge sheet
 dilli police par zimmedaari hogi ki wo is chargeshit ko sabit bhi kare
 Police came to know that the accused had planned the hacking plan long before the examination began
 chaatro se paise lekar unhen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kis centre kaa chunaav karen, uske aage kaa ve log dekh lenge
 The Delhi Police has also arrested four people in this regard
 dilli police ne chaar logon ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 Two supervisors from examination centers in Chandigarh and Noida have helped some students
 jis sarwar se pariksha ho rahi thi, use hack kar inaki madad kii gai
 During interrogation, the police found out that Prometric Testings Pvt Ltd had been awarded the contract for the examination
 chargeshit ke anusaar is company ne CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ke saath qaraar kiya ki wo ejeeniyar or site suparviser or anya staff uplabdh karaae taaki agzaam lab taiyaar ho sake
 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd has tied up with m / s Apex Services to arrange for the need of technical staff in the examination centers
 police kaa maananaa he ki itani kadi banati chali gai ki kai agent or sab agent is system main paidaa ho gaye jo chaatro ko khojane lage ki paise mil jaae to use acha rank de diya jaae
 The first step is to meet the candidate

 These agents keep in touch with the site's supervisor, the engineer
 ummidavaar ko bataaya jaataa he ki koun sa pariksha centre chune

 The student who gave the money was given access to the exam computer through the Internet and the exam hall was connected to the outside computer
 ye to post graduate pariksha kaa haal he kareeb teen lakh ke kareeb chaatr hissaa lete hai
 According to an Indian Express news, some 200 students are expected to pass through this route

 Anand Rai has been raising this issue for two consecutive years

 The investigation took place after removing the clothes

 The dress code has been issued as to how to reach the examination center
 kerala ke kannur main thodaa zyaada ho gaya magar chaatro ko ek aisi pariksha pranali kaa intazaar to he hi jis par aankh moond kar bharosa kiya ja sake

 is saal may main yojit neet yuji pariksha kii jaanch goa police kar rahi he, rajasthan kii aties kar rahi he or patna police kar rahi he
 When Anand Rai complained to the Delhi Police, he got a verbal reply that Neet is so busy with the investigation of PG that it is not possible to pay much attention to the investigation of Neet UG
 neet embibies or neet piji kii pariksha vyavastha puri tarah chori mukt nahin he
 The system should be such that there is no chance of rumor and no one can cheat anyone
 akhabaaron kii cliping dekhte hue lag rahaa tha ki har rajya main is pariksha ko lekar girohon kaa apana system he
 This is when Vyapam scam happened in a similar manner

 On June 15, the CBI registered a case on AIIMS MBBS for leaking the question paper
 28 may ko pariksha hui thi
 The Delhi High Court had sought a status report in the case of AIIMS paper leak to the Central Government, AIIMS and CBI

 sibiai kii jaanch hui thi
 It was a business of 100 crores
 2003 ke baad 2017 main sibiai phir ames pariksha kii jaanch kar rahi he

 It is not just about becoming a doctor, the government has spent public money on a student who has become a doctor by way of theft by giving money
 ek baar wo chori ke raste se doctor banegaa to doctorl kii naitikta kaa paalan kaise karegaa
 Vyapam scam was not properly debated in this country for political reasons but should have taken place
 supreme court ne sibiai se kaha he ki jaldi se sabhi maamalon main chargeshit file kiijie or hard discs kii report bhopal ke sibiai trial court main jamaa kiijie

 Vyapam is a department, not a regulatory body
 niyamon ko taak par rakhkar afasaron kii niyuktiyaan kii gayi
 The government also did not keep data on how many examinations have taken place
 pataa chalata he ki paardarshita kii ghor kami he
 The contract for PG NEET was awarded to Prometric, a US company
 is company ne police ko bataaya he ki uske software se chhedchhad ho sakati he
 The police were investigating whether the exam software could be hacked
 20 panne kii chargeshit main hanking se lekar phixing ke khataranaak kisse hai
 There is a charge sheet, the defect has not been proved
 ham is chargeshit ke bahaane pariksha pranali ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It will be the responsibility of Delhi Police to prove this charge sheet as well
 police ko pataa chalaa ki aropiyon ne hekking kii yojana imtahaan shuru hone se bahut pehle bana lee thi
 Taking money from the students, they were also told that they will see the center next to which center to choose

 CMS IT Services Pvt Ltd ne m / s Apex Services ke saath qaraar kiya ki pariksha kendaron main technical staff kii zarurat padegi uski vyavastha kare
 Police believe that the link has become so strong that many agents and sub-agents have been born in this system, who start searching for the students that if they get the money then they should be given a good rank
 pehla charan he ummidavaar kaa milanaa
 As soon as the candidate meets sab agent apane senior agent ko bataa detaa tha
 The senior agent gets in touch with the parent or student
 ye agent site ke suparviser, inzenier ke sampark main rahete hai
 The candidate is told to choose which examination center
 jahaan adhikari use nakal karne main madad sakate hai
 The company conducting the exam could not tell the police about the software with which the exam has been hacked
 paise dene vaale chaatr ko internet ke zariye agzaam computer kaa acces de diya gaya or agzaam haal se baahar ke computer se jod diya gaya
 This is the condition of post graduate examination, about three lakh students take part

 How the trust that broke the test system that millions of students and their families have so much confidence in

 Daundiyakheda fort of Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh was deserted and anonymous for 155 years, but due to excavation in search of gold by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the eyes of the entire country are suddenly on this fort after so many years
 
 sone kaa khajaana milanaa yaa na milanaa abhi bhavishya kii gart main he, lekin dondiakheda kile se sambandhit kuch bahut hi rochak jaankariyaan jarur nikalne lagi hai
 The new information that has been received about the Daundiyakheda Fort is that this fort has not existed since King Rao Rambakhsh, but from the Chandragupta Maurya period
 unnav jile ke dondiakheda gaanv main ganga nadi ke kinare bane is kile ke bare main gaanv ke bujurgon kaa kahana he ki dondiakheda ko pehle droni kshetra yaa phir dronikher se pahachaanaa jaataa tha
 During Chandragupta Maurya period this area used to be a part of Panchal province
 us kaal main 400 se 500 gaanvon ke bhu-bhaag ko dronimukh kaha jaataa tha
 The capital of this Dronimukh region used to be Daundiyakheda, so it had great importance
 saath hi tab ke raja kaa ek sainya adhikari apni tukdi ke saath yahaan basaner kiya karte the
 According to the famous archaeologist Alexander, he has said in one of his books that the famous Buddhist city named Haymukh was here, where the Chinese traveler Xuanzang came during the Harshavardhana period
 dondiakheda kile ke bare main apane ko raja raav rambakhsh singh kaa vanshaj bataane vaale chandivir pratap singh kaa kahana he ki is kile main shuru main bahubali bharon kaa kabja hua karata tha
 Bais tried several times to win the fort from the brothers, but was unsuccessful
 san 1266 ke aas-paas baison ke raja karan raay ke bete sedhury ne aakhirkaar is kile ko bharon se jeet liya
 He says that due to the capture of Baisas on this fort, it became known as Baiswara and Daundiyakheda was its capital
 vah aage bataate hai ki bas rajvansh main trilokachandra naamak pratapi raja hue
 He not only strengthened this fort, but also built two palaces inside the fort, as well as 500 soldiers inside the fort and ten thousand soldiers outside the fort
 raja trilokachandra ke bare main unhone bataaya ki vah dilli sultanate ke badshaah behalol lodi ke kaaphi najdiki sahyogi maane jate rahe hai
 Kalpi had spread from Mainpuri to Manikpur in Pratapgarh district and Bahraich in the east only during the time of Trilok Chandra
 gaanv ke 90 saal ke bujurg sarwan bataate hai ki bas vansh ke antim raja raav rambakhsh singh ko 28 disambar 1857 ko faansee dene ke baad british senanayake sar hope grant ne hamalaa karvaa kar ise nestnabud karvaa diya tha
 If we talk about the geography of this fort, then this fort is built on a 50 feet high earthen mound in the south-east, about 33 kilometers from the Unnao district headquarters of Uttar Pradesh
 kile ke pashchim disha main ganga nadi tile ko chhu kar bahati he or kile kaa mukhya dwaar purv disha kii ore tha
 The length of the front of the fort is 385 feet and the rear is somewhat wider
 kile kaa kshetrafal 1,92,500 varg feet he
 The fort was surrounded by 30-32 ft thick walls of mud all around and a 50 ft deep moat was built around it, which was always filled with water
 yah bataanaa jaruri he ki isse pehle khandhar main badal chuke is aitihaasik dharohar kii khabar na to eesai ko thi or na hi koi gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan (enjio) hi is kile ke sangrakshan ke liye ab tak aage aayaa
 Now when a saint Shobhan Sarkar told the Central Government about the dream of having a treasure of one thousand tons of gold here, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and ASI came into action and it came in the headlines
 buudhvaar blockbster kii baat karen to ab tak yah record salmaan khan (salman Khan) kii sultan (sultan) ke paas tha
 Sultan collected 36 crores on Wednesday

 '' piples democratic party (pidipi) ke saath takreeban saadhe teen saal ke gathbandhan ke khatm hone ke liye unhone pidipi ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya
 Great care was taken in the whole exercise so that it could be decided that Mehbooba and her party would not even get a clue of it and they could not make any preparations
 yahaan tak ki jammu kashmir piples conference ke vidhayak sajaad lone ne bhi mana ki party aisa kadam uthaane ja rahi he iskaa ratti bhar bhi andaja nahin tha, jo bhaajapa ke sheersh rashtriya netritv ke kareeb maane jate hai or bhaajapa ke aagrah par hi unhen sarkaar main mantri ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The PDP-BJP is not going to last long, it was known to everyone, but it was not known that it would happen so soon
 hairaani to iske samay or is pahalu main he ki gathbandhan se kinaaraa bhaajapa ne kiya he, pidipi ne nahin
 Understand the mutual tussle between the two partners of the alliance
 july 2017 main, lashkar-e-taiyaba ne ek bhayanak hamalaa karke amarnath yatra ke baad ghar laut rahe gujarat or maharashtra ke aath tirthayatriyon kii hatya kar di thi
 Madhav remained optimistic about the alliance, at least publicly
 unhone dilli main india today se kaha tha, "ham yah prayaas karenge ki sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa kare
 a few months after this, when Mehbooba sacked Finance Minister (and mediator with Delhi) Hasib Drabu from the Cabinet in March this year, it was accompanied by a "strong signal" to BJP that the pdp's declining credentials in the Valley Seen as a struggle to save
 tab varisht pidipi netaaon ne khulkar kahana shuru kar diya ki "is gathbandhan ke kaaran party (pidipi) ne saakh kho di he
 "the new Finance Minister, Syed Altaf Bukhari, who replaced Drabu, said," Our party will not compromise with ideology
 aisi naubat aati he to ham gathbandhan todane main koi sankoch nahin karenge
 "so, then why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah feel that the time had come to break away from the alliance? Madhav told reporters in Delhi that this was a decision taken in the national interest
" unhone kaha, "desh kii akhandta or suraksha ke bade rashtriya hiton or is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa ek abhinn ang he or rajya kii maujuuda sthiti ko dekhte hue satta rajyapal ko saunp di jaae
 It is necessary to hand over the responsibility of controlling the situation to the Governor, which is why we have taken this decision
 ''bhaajapa mahasachiv ne bataaya ki ramajaan ke pavitra maheene main dilli kii taraf se ekatarfa yudhviram kii pahal kii gai thi lekin ugravadi or algaavvaadi kheme ne is pahal ko lekar "santoshjanak ravaiya'' nahin dikhaaya
 The worsening situation of law and order and the fundamental rights of living and expression in a safe environment, the killing of Shujaat Bukhari, the editor of Rising Kashmir in the midst of Srinagar day, indicates a worrisome security situation in the state and the promotion of radicalism
 bataaya jaataa he ki 10 june ko kashmir ke mantriyon ke saath baithak main shah ne kaha ki pidipi ke saath rajya main is "asafal'' gathbandhan ko or aage badhaayaa gaya to yah bhaajapa ke liye rashtriya str par "traasad'' sabit hoga
 The BJP president told him that the PDP leadership (mehbooba) had failed to respond satisfactorily to the plenary support being received by the Center, including efforts such as a unilateral ceasefire announced on 16 May
 andruni sutara bataate hai ki jammu-kashmir main rajyapal shashan lagane ke sandarbh main faisla rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) netritv dwaara sarvasammati se liya gaya tha
 This was discussed in detail at a Pune meeting in May
 baithak main sangh ke varisht kaaryakartaaon kaa vichaar tha, "netritv sarvasammati se aisa maanata he ki jammu-kashmir main gathbandhan ke kaaran deshbhar main bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta naitik rup se hatotsahit honge
 He agreed that "if this alliance continues till 2019, the nationalist image of the BJP will be completely matured
" ''bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki mahabuuba mufti ramajaan bitne ke baad bhi ghati ke logon main vishwaas bahaali ke naam par yudhviram ko jari rakhane kii jid kar rahi thim, jisane gathbandhan ke liye ghutan kaa aisa maahaul banaaya ki haath peeche khinchne ke alaava koi rasta na tha
 Despite opposition from Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the army and other security forces deployed in the Valley, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on May 16 announced a unilateral moratorium on anti-terror action for a month
 unhone algaavvaadi hurriyat netaaon samet kashmir ke sabhi jimmedaar pakshon ke saath baatcheet kaa ek nayaa daur shuru karne kii apil bhi kii thi
 But within a month it was clear that the terrorists took full advantage of this concession

 Only 25 such incidents were observed in the month before the ceasefire
 algaavvaadi bhi baatcheet behaal karne ke liye asambhav-si purv sharten rakh rahe the
 The RSS leadership was realizing that while Mehbooba's party was benefiting politically from this ceasefire, the bjp's nationalist image of taking a tough stand against anti-national separatists is getting a deep blow
 ek bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, "jis yudhviram kaa koi sakaaratmak laabh nahin dikh rahaa tha, use aage jari rakhane se party ko rashtriya str par kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa padataa
 But perhaps the killing of journalist Bukhari and national rifle soldier Aurangzeb on June 14, two days before Eid, compelled Shah to take the decision hastily
 donon hi ghatnaayen ghati main shanti bahaali kii koshishon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke iraade se kii gai thim
 These attacks put pressure on the BJP to end the ceasefire
 purv up-mukhyamantri kavindra gupta aatankwaad se nipatane main mahabuuba par "naram'' rukh akhriyaar karne kaa aarope lagaate hai
 The BJP leader alleges that while the Chief Minister removed the firs from 11,000 stone-pelters arguing that this was his first crime and that they were children, there were attempts to register an FIR against the paramilitary forces
 jammu main kai bhaajapa netaaon ne 27 janvari ko shopiyaan main patharbaajon kii baari bheed par goli chalaane kii ghatana, jisamen teen yuva maare gaye the, main ek adhikari samet kai javaanon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karaane par virodh pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 Many BJP leaders believe that Mehbooba was very sympathetic and soft-witted towards the jamaat-e-islami and other fundamentalists as these organizations aided the PDP in the 2014 assembly elections
 mukhyamantri ke is ravaie ke kaaran ghati main aatankwaadi sanghathan sthaneey logon ko bhartee karne or apni jaden jamaane main kaamyaab ho rahe the
 He reminds that after the killing of Hizbul commander Burhan Wani in July 2016, the chief minister and his party leaders were mysteriously playing a game of accusation and counter-accusation, instead of making serious efforts to control the worsening situation in the state
 mahabuuba ne daawa kiya tha ki unhen andaja hi nahin tha ki is muthbhed main vaani ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he or pidipi ke saansad mujffar beg ne kaha ki surakshabalon ne jaan-boojhkar unase yah jaankaree chhupaae rakhi
 Beg even went so far as to say that the security forces ignored the mandatory process of encounter
 unhen vaani ko muthbhed main maar giraane kii bajaae jinda pakadaaey kii koshish kerani chahie thi
 Analysts also believe that in order to regain its dwindling popularity in South Kashmir, the PDP had taken a soft approach towards separatists and militants, thereby worsening the security situation in the Valley
 jaahir he, yudhviram ko aage jari rakhana sahi nahin tha, khaastaur se aagaamee amarnath yatra ke sandarbh main
 Around 300,000 Hindu pilgrims are expected to visit the cave temple for an annual darshan in the 40-day Amarnath Yatra starting 28 June
 ek purv sena adhikari, jo haal tak ghati main ek mahatvapurn jimmedaari nibhaa rahe the, kaa kahana tha ki "aisi sarkaar jo rajya police dwaara jutai gai soochna ko sena or ardhsainik balon ke saath saajha karne main baadhak ban jaati he, uske vidaa hone se ab aatankwaadi khataron se nipatane main kaaphi sahuliyat ho jaaegi
 "so, what is going to happen in Jammu and Kashmir now?" At present, all the major political parties - National Conference, Congress and PDP have also ruled out the possibility of any alternative alliance, then another phase of Governor's rule will begin in the state
 aazaadee ke baad se yah aathvaan mauka hoga jab rajya par sidhe dilli kii hukumat chalegi
 President's rule was first imposed in March 1977, when Congress, under the chairmanship of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, withdrew support to Sheikh Abdullah's government
 isse pehle aakhri baar janvari 2016 main rajyapal shashan lagaana padaa tha, jab mahabuuba mukrati ne apane pita ke nidhan ke baad teen maheene tak mukhyamantri kii kursi khaali hi rakhi thi
 Shortly before addressing the press in Srinagar on 19 June, Mehbooba told Governor Vohra that "we (PDP) do not want to try to form any other alliance"
 '' purv mukhyamantri or neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla ne bhi congress ke saath milakar pidipi kii aguwai vaali sarkaar ko samarthan karne ke apane janvari 2015 ke puraane prastaav par phir se vichaar karne kii kisi bhi sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya
 Omar made it clear that now the Governor's rule is the only option in which the elections should be held at the earliest after normalizing the situation
 congress ne bhi kuch aisi hi raay jaahir kii
 Former State Chief Minister and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, "for us, there is no difference between BJP and PDP now
 ''baharhaal, umr jis jaldi chunaavon kii baat kar rahe hai, philhal uski sambhaavna kam hi dikhti he
 Think of it this way — two years have passed since Mehbooba Mufti resigned from Anantnag seat in South Kashmir after becoming Chief Minister in April 2016, but a Lok Sabha by-election could not be held there
 april 2017 main srinagar seat ke liye hue upachunaav main mahaj 7
 There was 1 per cent voting and eight people including a 15-year-old school child were killed in the violence during the election
 haalanki aisa kaha jaataa he anantnag upachunaav ko sirf isliye taal diya gaya tha kyonki mahabuuba ke pidipi ke apane puraane garh ko bachaane kii sambhaavna bahut kam dikhti thi or ve haar kaa saamana karne kii icchhuk nahin thi
 But in the meantime, a third possibility is being talked about in Srinagar and Jammu with a suppressed tongue
 2016 main, mahabuuba apane pita ke nidhan ke baad tab tak mukhyamantri kii kursi par baithne ko raji na huin jab tak ki unhen gathbandhan ke saajha agenda main kiye gaye pramukh vaadon ko puraa karne kaa pakkaa bharosa nahin mila tha
 Unhappy with his demands, it is said that the BJP leadership had sidelined Mehbooba and persuaded 22 of the pdp's 27 mlas to form an alternative front with a new coalition government with the BJP
 Go ahead
 rajyapal vohara ne pradhanmantri modi or shah ko salaah di thi ki mahabuuba ko satta se hataakar kisi nai sarkaar ke gathan kii koshishon se rajya ke halaat bahut kharaab ho sakate hai
 Although there are no signs of attempts by the BJP to form a government, but whether the BJP will make another attempt to form a coalition government, the PDP leaders say that it can only be judged by the Governor's decision that the Assembly Whether they break it or not

 centre ne yojana kii vakaalat kii he
 Attorney General KK Venugopal asked the Supreme Court not to pass a court order on the issue of electoral bonds during the election process
 centre ne court se aagrah kiya ki nyaayalay ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie or chunaav prakriya ke puraa hone ke baad is mudde par nirnay lenaa chahie
 Arguing for the Center, Attorney General KK Venugopal said that the electoral bond is a major step to ensure transparency and accountability for political donations
 agi kaa kahana he ki chunavi band se pehle, adhikansh daan nakad ke madhyam se kiye gaye the, jisase behisaab dhan chunaav main daale gaye the
 Electoral bonds ensure that payments are made only through checks, drafts and direct debits
 koi bhi kaala dhan chunaav main nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Earlier during the hearing on Wednesday, the Election Commission said that it is not against electoral bonds but against keeping the identity of the donor secret
 supreme court ne chunaav ayog ko yaad dilaayaa ki usne centre ko likhe apane patr main chunavi bond ko pratigaami kadam qaraar diya tha
 The court asked if the Commission was changing its stand
 EC ne supreme court ko bataaya ki elactoral bond main kuch bhi galat nahin he, lekin daankarta ke naam saarvajanik kiye jane chahie kyonki logon or chunaav ayog ko raajnneetik dalon kii funding ke bare main jaanane kaa adhikaar he
