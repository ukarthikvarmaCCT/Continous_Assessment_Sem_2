 To curb black money after demonetisation, the Central Government has made important amendments in the Income Tax Act
 in sanshodhano se inakam tex aankalan karne vaale adhikari kii shaktiyon main ijapha karte hue praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki yadi koi vyakti apni aay athwa kharch ko samajhane main vifal hota he to usapar udhiktam 83 fisadi kii dar se tex lagaaya jaae
 Prior to the amendment this limit was just 35 per cent
 tex niyamon main hue is sanshodhan se sidhaa asar aay or kharch ke in paanch kshetron par padana tay he
 These provisions are also expected to shock the direction of the Central Government, which has told the Assessing Officers of the Tax Department not to disturb the common man
 inakam tex kanoon main sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya tha jisasetax chorikar pratibandhit 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko jamaa karne waalon se tex vasula ja sake
 But after the new law, it is impossible to see those people who have deposited the amount of tax evasion prohibited by resorting to income tax law and who have deposited their money within the purview of the law
 nae kanoon se kahaan ho sakati he pareshaani1
 If you have shown a loan from a friend, if you have shown any of your income as a loan from a friend and the loan amount falls in the tax net, then the Income Tax Officer may be suspicious of you
 is sthiti main vah aapse mitra se liye gaye karj kaa adhik byora maang saktaa he
 If this statement is not available, you will be taxed at the same rate as those depositing black money

 Inherited jewelery: If you have declared such jewelery of more than 500 grams in the declared income, where you are claiming that the jewelery is inherited from your ancestors, then you can once again come to the radar of the Income Tax Department

 To avoid this, you have to show your tax assessment officer with sufficient proof that the money raised for the business does not fall in the category of black money
 aisa na kar paane kii sthiti main aapke capital amount par utana hi tex thopa ja saktaa he jitna caledhan ke liye prastaavit kiya gaya he

 For this, if your bank does not support your expenses from the initial purchase of the wedding to the function of the wedding, then the tax department can charge you tax in lieu of spending black money in the wedding

 At the same time, in the annual income declaration, if the tax department finds an inconsistency of over-spending and you are unable to explain your house expenses to the tax assessment officer, then you can be taxed at a higher rate

 We got tickets through the boys cricket team of the famous Rajkumar College, Rajkot, who visited the match

 India vs West Indies in the 1980s was very similar to Afghanistan vs India in 2015, it was very similar, if not exactly

 Perhaps he is the greatest team of all time, you have rarely seen such a complete team, including Richards' greatness, the strength of Greenidge and Lloyd, the magic of Dujon and above all the most sharp bowler in the history of cricket (all four! ), She would be invincible of course
 isliye hamane sochaa ki agar hamaari team duusare number par bhi rahi to cricket ke is mahaan maidan main ek din bitaana bura nahin he
 When the Indian team was reduced to just 183 runs, former Test player Yajuvendra Singh, one of that bunch of Indian team lovers, thought we should buy something later
 unke bhai usee shaam aane vaale the
 So, Yajuvendra Singh, who made the record of catching the most catches in an innings of a Test, felt that now only the formality of the final result has to be completed, so it is better to slip

 We often played club matches together and never thought that he would play in the World Cup
 phir bhi, vah sabase bade match main tha or tej gendon ke sabase umdaa khilaadi kii gilliyaan chatka rahaa tha
 Sandhu was able to dance to the West Indies at the behest of his fingers, seeing this, we started to feel that today is something special

 Former Team India captain Rahul Dravidane has said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who surprised everyone by retiring from the Test cricket, will be known as a captain who did not care about the team's leadership and just talking while giving an example
 dravidane kaha, ‘vah aisa captain he jiske netritv main khilne main mujhe majaa aayaa
 He said, "one thing i love about Dhoni is that you will get what you see
 koi jatilta nahin, hameshaa udaaran ke saath aguai kii
 One of the things that i liked best about playing under Dhoni was that he never asked you to do something that he couldn't do himself
 ’austrailia ke khilaaf melbern main drow samaapt hue tisare test ke baad dhoni ne test cricket ko alavida kah diya
 Dhoni, however, did not give any indication of retiring even after the end of the match
 dravid ne kaha, ‘vaastaviktaa yah he ki uski maujuudagi main senior samooh badlaav ke daur se guzar rahaa tha or yuva khilaadi aa rahe the
 He doesn't quite talk as a captain and tries to win your respect by his work
 vah kabhi peeche nahin hatataa or udhaaharan ke saath aguai karata he or zyada bolne main vishwaas nahin karata
 Dravid said that Dhoni is credited with being an inspiration to small-town players
 purv bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘ranchi jaise chote shahar se aakar bharat kii captaini karnaa or 90 test match khelnaa
 i think it made the captaincy work even more respected
 ’ dravid ne kaha ki dhoni ke sanyas kii ghoshnaa se vah bhi stabdh the
 He said that if India had not lost the current series against Australia, then Dhoni might have taken more time to decide on his career
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki isaki ummid nahin thi ki vah siries ke bich main aisa karegaa
 i hoped that he would review at the end of the series because India would not have to play Test cricket for the next seven or eight months
 ’ dravid ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak main dhoni ko jaanata hum agar siries haari nahin hoti to mujhe nahin lagata ki vah bich main aisa faisla karata
 Dravid praised Dhoni's captaincy style and called him an aggressive captain
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat kii captaini karte hue vah kabhi rakshaatmak nahin hua
 He always attacked with spinners, he always tried to get results on spin-friendly pitches
 videshon main pichley teen yaa chaar saal main use laga ki shaayad uske paas aise sansaadhan nahin hai ki 20 wicket chatkaaye ja saken

 The attack was carried out in the remote Tirah Valley, considered a stronghold of militants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda affiliate lashkar-e-islam
 ek suraksha adhikari ne kaha ki aatankwaadiyon ke chaar thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaakar baari golibari kii gai
 He said that according to initial information five terrorists were killed
 yah karrwai jile main pichley maheene shuru kiye gaye khabar-1 abhiyaan ke tahat kii gayi
 The main objective of this campaign is to wipe out terrorists from the areas extending from Bara tehsil to the border of Tirah valley, after which the second phase of the campaign will be started

 aapako jaanakar hairaan hogi ki ye farji baba bhi vakt ke saath hytech ho chale hai
 Unlike the magazines and advertisements, these babas have made social media their new haunt
 yakeen nahin aata to google par search kar dekhie ki tantrikon kaa jaal batta kis kadar failaa hua he
 These are some of the websites that operate in Delhi and NCR, which claimed to solve all the problems of human beings in a pinch
 keval google or website hi nahin balki fasebuk par kai grups bhi banaae gaye hai jinamein vaseekaran, aghori samet kai samasyaon se nijaat dilaane kaa daawa kai baabaaon ne kiya he
 After the death of 11 people in the Burari case, many tantric and captivating babas have covered their net but they are still playing with the life of the deft people on social media
 buraadi main aise hakeekat main badal gaya maut kaa reharsalvasikaran, santan na hona aam jivan kii wo sari samasyaon ko na keval bhunaate hai balki moti rakam vasuul karte hai
 When there is strictness, they shift from social advertising to social media nowadays

 The risk of getting caught on social media is very low
 soshal media or fasebuk par inako trek kar paanaa aasaan nahin he
 Mostly they make whatsapp calls from clients, normal times are not touched at all
 inkaa dhandha keval dilli-ensiaar ke aarthik rup se kamazor ilaako main hi nahin balki posh ilaakon main bhi chalata he
 In this episode of searching for Baba, we have discovered a Baba who gets some people after giving the advertisement in some papers, then after applying lime, then he gets x in his work
 ek baba kii hamaari khoj rajouri garden main gupta complex main second floor par jaakar khatm hui jahaan par hamane aayush naam ke shaks ko pakadaa jo duaon ko tabeez main band kar logon kii har mushkil aasaan banane kaa daawa karata he lekin camere par usne kaha ki wo vaseekaran bilkul nahin karata
 On the charge of captivating, Ayush said that he does not do anything other than dua amulets
 wo sirf logo ko yantra detaa he kaarobaar main barkat ke liye yaa phir bigade kaam ko banane ke liye
 Ayush claims that if you pray with heart, everything will be alright
 sabase khaas baat yantra dene vaale is shaks ne kaha ki buraadi kii ghatana ko anjaam dene ke liye aisa koi tantric nahin bana jo is tarah se kar sake

 In view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, BJP released the list of 39 candidates on Tuesday, so everyone was surprised to see the names of the candidates on the Lok Sabha seat
 bijepi kii candidet list ke mutabik, varun gandhi or menka gandhi kii siton main pherbadal kiya gaya he or ab uttar pradesh ke pilibhit se varun gandhi or sultanpur se menka gandhi chunaav ladengi
 It is believed that Union Minister Maneka Gandhi has left Pilibhit's seat for his son Varun Gandhi, from where Varun Gandhi will now contest
 bataa den ki varun gandhi sultanpur se maujuuda saansad hai, jo amethi loksabhaa seat se kaaphi paas he or yahaan ke saansad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi hai
 Maneka Gandhi will now contest from her son Varun's parliamentary constituency Sultanpur
 haalanki, siton kii adla-badali kaa koi kaaran nahin bataaya gaya he, magar sutara kehete hai ki yah kadam menka gandhi ne khud sujhaayaa tha, kyonki unhen laga ki varun gandhi pilibhitamen majbootee se batting kar baaji apane naam kar sakate hai
 According to sources, this suggestion was made by Maneka Gandhi amid fears that Varun Gandhi might be defeated by the strong candidate of Congress
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav 11 april se 19 may ke bich saat charnon main hone hai or nateezon kaa elaan 23 may ko kiya jayega
 Now after the reshuffle of seats, it has been decided that Varun Gandhi will now show his stamina in the election ground in Pilibhit, the political legacy of his mother
 aisa duusari baar hua he, jab bete ke liye maa ne apni pasandida loksabhaa seat pilibhit chodi he
 That is, once in 2009, Maneka Gandhi left Pilibhit's seat for Varun Gandhi and the second time is now 2019
 haalanki, sutara bataa rahe hai ki sultanpur main is baar varun gandhi kii sthiti acchhee nahin he
 This is the reason why Maneka Gandhi sacrificed her seat for fear of defeat
 saal 2009 main bijepi kii tikat par varun gandhi ne apni maa kii jagah par pilibhit se chunaav ladaa tha, jisamen unhone jeet darj kii thi
 It was only in 2009 that Varun Gandhi emerged as the bjp's Fire Brand leader by making controversial statements
 vahiin, 2014 main varun gandhi ko bijepi ne sultanpur se tikat diya tha, jisamen varun gandhi ne phir jeet darj kii
 In the list released by BJP, no candidate has been announced from Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats
 bataa den ki 2018 main hue loksabhaa upachunaav main in donon jagah se bijepi ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha

 agar yaqub memon ko 30 july ko faansee di gai to vah lagaataar teesraa apradhi hoga jisaki dayaa yachika raashtrapati pranab mukherjee khaarij kar denge
 Since becoming President in 2012, Pranab Mukherjee has rejected mercy petitions in 24 cases
 jaaniye dayaa yachikaaon ke niyam, prakriya or itihaas ke bare main 10 khaas baaten:1
 According to Article 72 of the Constitution, the President can waive, suspend, reduce or amend the death sentence
 lekin raashtrapati apni marji se aisa nahin karte
 It is clearly stated in the constitution that the President can forgive or waive it only after consulting the Council of Ministers
 2
 According to the current rules, the Ministry of Home Affairs gives its favor in writing to the President
 ise hi cabinet kaa paksh maanakar raashtrapati dayaa yachika par faisla lete hai
 3

 doshi vyakti adhikariyon, vakeelon yaa parivaar ke logon ke jariye dayaa yachikaayen bhej sakate hai
 Petitions can also be mailed to the Ministry of Home Affairs or the President's office these days
 5
 Different presidents have dealt with mercy petitions differently
 iske liye koi samaysima tay nahin he
 Hence, both the President and the Ministry of Home Affairs have had several petitions pending for many years
 6
 When former President APJ Abdul Kalam's term ended, he left about two dozen pending mercy petitions
 unhone sirf do dayaa yachikaaon kaa nipataara kiya
 In 2004, he dismissed the mercy petition of rape and murder convict Dhananjay Chatterjee and commuted the death sentence of Kheeraj Ram to life imprisonment in 2006
 7
 Kalam was followed by KR Narayanan as President
 unhone 1997 se 2002 ke bich apane kaarykaal main ek bhi dayaa yachika kaa nipataara nahin kiya
 8
 haalanki zyaadaatar raashtrapatiyon ne dayaa yachikaaon par bina kisi dayaa ke faisle liye
 According to information from RTI, out of 77 mercy petitions between 1991 and 2010, Presidents rejected 69

 The record for rejecting the highest number of mercy petitions is in the name of R

 98 meter (baari barish ke chalate) kii apni puri kshamta ke najadik pahunchane ke saath madhya pradesh or gujarat ek alag hi vivaad main ulajh gaye hai
 The Madhya Pradesh government has accused the Gujarat government of closing the water gates well ahead of schedule with mutual agreement of the states with the Narmada Control Authority (NCA)
 ensie kaa gathan narmada jal vivaad tribunel ke adeshon ko lagu karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Madhya Pradesh alleges that the closure of the water gate poses a danger of over 2,000 farmers from about 60 villages in the state's Dhar and Barwani districts drowning their land
 is baandh kii oonchai 2017 main badha di gai thi lekin uske baad yah pehla saal he jab yah apni adhiktam kshamta tak bhar saktaa he
 By the end of August, the water level had risen to 135 meters, with flooding at the edges in Chikhalda and some other places in Madhya Pradesh
 tab rajya ne apana virodh darj karaayaa tha kyonki sahmati ke anusaar pani kaa str 30 sitambar tak hi 135 meter tak pahunchnaa chahie tha
 The closure of the gates of the dam could not provide time for the residents to evacuate from the floods
 baandh se sambandhit sabhi maamalon ko dekhne ke liye bani nodel agency narmada ghati vikaas praadhikaran (envidie) ne india today ko bataaya ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ko ek or maheenaa bhi mil jaataa to bhi sarkaar prabhavit logon ko shaayad hi vahaan se nikaal paati
 As per the Supreme Court decision of the final settlement of February 2017, each affected family would get Rs 60 lakh
 die jane the jisane pehle ke muaavja package ko sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 The then Madhya Pradesh government then paid Rs 900 crore
 ke ek atirikt package kii ghoshnaa kii thi jiske anusaar jin pariwaron ne pehle 5
 8 lakhs
 kaa package sweekaar kar liya tha, unhen atirikt rakam di jaaegi
 The Gujarat government says that it has given its share of the compensation amount
 march, 2019 tak madhya pradesh sarkaar ne muaavje ke taur par 419 karod ru
 90 crores as the second installment of compensation announced by the state
 kharch kar die the
 This issue has now taken a political turn
 rajya kii maujuuda congress sarkaar kaa aarope he ki gujarat sarkaar ne ''hamaari maang ke anusaar muaavje kii puri rakam nahin di he
 "the NVDA minister in Madhya Pradesh government Surendra Singh Baghel says," The Gujarat government should also look at it from a human aspect
 vah logon ko kaise doobane ke liye chhod sakati he
 Fingers are being raised on the former Shivraj Singh Chauhan government in Madhya Pradesh
 baghel poochhate hai, ''gujarat sarkaar kahati he ki usne muaavje kii rakam de di he
 The former BJP government in Madhya Pradesh says that it has used the money
 agar aisa he to ab bhi log kyon kah rahe hai ki unhen muaavja nahin mila he
 The Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) has been opposing the sinking of villages
 enbie kii netaa medha patkar ne 25 agast ko bhukh hadtaal shuru kar di, lekin madhya pradesh sarkaar kii ore se karrwai kaa bharosa die jane se nau din baad ve naram pad gayi
 "our data shows that there are 28,000 affected families right now," says Rahul Yadav of the NBA
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne 1,857 karod ru
 Had prepared a rehabilitation package of which is insufficient
 ise sanshodhit kiya janaa chahie
 “the real issue here is the difference in the number of affected families
 is sambandh main andolan ke kaaryakarta or rajya sarkaar ke aankade alag-alag hai
 The NBA says 192 villages and Dharampuri town are affected, while the Madhya Pradesh government says that only 178 villages are affected
 yadav kehete hai, ''madhya pradesh ensie ko hameshaa (2008-16) bataata rahaa he ki ab punarvaas ke liye koi parivaar vanchit nahin rah gaya he
 Then who are these people? ”2,000 families are going to be homeless from the house of some 60 villages in Madhya Pradesh and Barwani districts as Sardar Sarovar Dam will have more water than capacity *** pradhanmantri narendra modi railway ke aadhunikeekaran or vistaar kii disha main kiye gayi kaaryon kii agle saptaah samiksha karenge
 On February 9, the Prime Minister will preside over a meeting in which he will review railway projects along with other ministries related to infrastructure including roads, shipping and civil aviation
 ab railway tikat bhi ‘cash on delivery’ parek adhikari ne bataaya ki yah baithak in dhanchaagat mantralayon kii disambar main pradhanmantri dwaara kii gai baithak kii agali kadi he
 During that meeting, the Prime Minister had said that the progress in laying new railway lines was unsatisfactory and had directed to expedite the work of the railways so that the construction season could be put to optimum use
 pradhanmantri kii un tippaniyon ke maddenjar rail mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'hamane ab kuch pariyojnaon ko bina zyada vilamb ke puraa karne ke liye praathamikta di he
 According to the official, these include new railway lines, doubling of railway lines and projects related to Aman Transformation
 'input-bhashaa Sulabh International has decided to build a modern toilet in her house, with Sulabh International announcing the award of one lakh rupees to the woman who threatened to divorce her husband if there is no toilet in the house
 bihar ke patna jila ke bihata anumandal ke sadeshopur nivasee alakh niranjan kii patni varsh 2009 se ghar main toilet banane kii maang karti aa rahi thi
 On the woman's demand, her husband only gave her the assurance to build a toilet
 jiske baad vah mahila helpline par pahunchi or usne ghar main toilet nahin hone ke kaaran usase ho rahi kathinaayee ke chalate apane pati se talaak dilaane main madad kiye jane kii guhaar lagaai
 The victim says that due to the absence of toilets in the house, she has to go out for defecation in the dark while waiting for her to get up in the evening and given the difficulty, she is no longer willing to live with her husband
 mahila kaa aarope he ki ghar main toilet banane ke liye uske dwaara dabaav banaae jane par pati uski pitayee karte hai
 Bhaneshwar Pathak, the founder of Sulabh, who intervened in the divorce, praised Sulabh, interfering in the matter, saying that a modern toilet would be constructed in the woman's house so that the lack of toilet does not become an obstacle in her happy married life
 pathak ne mahila ke is saahsee kadam ke liye uski tarif karte hue kaha ki isse samaaj main toilet ke mahatv ke prati jagriti laane main madad milegi
 Announcing that the said woman would be honored with an amount of Rs one lakh on behalf of her organization, she said that she would not allow divorce between them with just one toilet

 19 karod aabaadi ke paas toilet nahin he
 Central government 1 till 2013 in the state
 11 karod toilet banane kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya tha
 Reward has already been received
 This is not the first time that someone has opposed not having toilet in the house, but her husband's life is in danger when the tribal woman Anita, resident of Betul, Madhya Pradesh, three years ago protested against not having toilet in her in-laws' house
 Was lying
 sulabh international ne is mahila ko paanch lakh rupee dekar sammanit kiya tha
 Similarly, Priyanka Bharti of Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh was also honored for her bold move and she worked with Bollywood actress Vidya Balan in an advertisement to create public awareness towards the toilet as a motivator of Sulabh International

 puraane disha-nirdeshon ke saath dikkat yah he ki unamem maan liya jaataa he ki andey or duusare animal food ke seven se rakt main cholestrol kaa str bad jaataa he
 Head of the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AQUAS) in Delhi, Professor Dr
 nikhil tandon kehete hai, ''maan lijie, or beshak kuch andey khaanaa sahi bhi he
 But your body does not work like this
 " aadmi kaa sharir apni jarurat kaa sabhi cholestrol bana letaa he, jo koshikaon ke kriyalap ke liye aavashyak tatv he
 Every day your liver makes 1 to 2 grams and the rest is obtained by eating and drinking
 ve bataate hai, ''lekin jab koi khaane main adhik cholestrol letaa he to sharir kam paidaa karata he
 "when you take less cholesterol in food, the body makes more

 What to do, what not to do
 The new guidelines of Colostal have freed the eggs with some hesitation
 haalanki kuch bhojan vigyaani chintit hai ki cholestrol par lacheele disha-nirdeshon se galat sandesh jayega or log har subah naashte main paanch-chah andey khaane lagenge
 They say that eat a variety of foods with rich nutrition, except for more spicy dishes
 anda bhi khaaie par use galat tareeke se na lijie
 So consider some of these tips: For most people, eating an egg daily does not pose a risk of heart attack, or any type of heart disease
 agar pehle se hi dil ke marij hai yaa duusari vajahon se dil kii beemaari kii ashanka adhik he yaa madhumeh se peedit hai to hafte main teen andey se zyada na khaaie
 There is no definite figure of how many eggs to eat daily but one egg intake is perfect (emma Morano, who died at the age of 115 this year, ate three eggs daily)
 aap hafte main kitne andey khaaen, yah aapke baaki khan-paan par nirbhar karata he
 What you eat with eggs matters a lot (processed "bad carbohydrates" or oil-ghee, or maida and rice, potatoes, fried foods, processed food or sweetened beverages)
 andon ke saath taaja subjiyan khaaen, taaki swasth anti-oxident sharir ko milen
 The next scandal of eggs is always controversial, another scandal of eggs is emerging

 To speed up production, chickens are kept hungry and large ruthless methods are adopted

 In such a situation, who can tell what is hidden inside the egg, which does not cause any trouble? Research from Washington's Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy and Delhi's Public Health Foundation of India found that 18 poultry farms in Punjab were using uncontrolled antibiotic and anti-drug bacteria

 uttar pradesh or bihar loksabhaa up-chunaav main bhaajapa kii haar ne 2019 ke liye gaiyr endie dalon ko ek saath aane ke liye vaicharik jameen uplabdh kara di he
 The results show that the BJP, equipped with a relatively strong organization, face and other facilities of power at the national and regional level, was troubled by unseen parties
 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur seat bhaajapa 1989 se lagaataar jeet rahi he
 The current Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been a five-time MP from here
 yahaan bhaajapa pratyaashee ke khilaaf sapa chunaav lard rahi thi or bispi ne sapa ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 The fact that the yadav-muslims and Dalits were united by merely announcing candidates from the SP and supporting Mayawati's support for the SP meant that political opposing voters had been together for years
 mayawati ke voter ne khulkar apana vot sapa ko diya nateeja yah hua ki bhaajapa ke liye sabase sef maane jane vaale gorakhpur seat par sapa pratyaashee jeet gaya
 The same story happened in Phulpur
 aaj ke nateezon kaa sanket he ki yadi 2019 main uttar-pradesh main sapa or basapa saath rahe to bhaajapa ko jabardast nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The result of the neighboring state of Bihar in Uttar Pradesh is worse for the BJP

 Despite the alliance of JDU-BJP-LJP and RLSP, BJP lost to Araria Lok Sabha seat

 BJP is saying that she will review the defeat but the matter is not just to lose
 asli masalaa yah he ki logon ne un dalon yaa gathbandhanon ko sweekaar karnaa shuru kiya he jiskaa na to majboot netaa saamne he, na centre yaa rajya main satta uske paas he, na hi bhaajapa jaisaa majboot sanghathan
 Meaning people are beginning to give the opportunity for change, due to which a strong opposition coalition can stand in front of BJP and challenge in 2019
 *** Police-administration is investigating which forces were behind the violence that erupted in western Uttar Pradesh during the Dalit movement

 police ke shaq ke kai kaaran hai
 First of all, a large group of Dalits reached Mandi police station in a large number of tractor-trolleys from remote villages
 iskaa matlab ye ki garib daliton ko laane ke liye baqayda tractor-trollies muhaiyaa karaae gaye
 Fear of non-dalits in the violence, secondly, some such pictures and videos have come out during the protest in which Muslims were also seen performing
 police kii praathmik jaanch main gaiyr dalit hinduon ke bhi pradarshan main shaamil hone kaa andeh he
 This is possible only when an organization or political party is involved in it in a coordinated manner

 Senior Superintendent of Police of Muzaffarnagar Anant Dev said that we will not leave the miscreants and preparations are being made to impose rasuka on those who are guilty

 Advocates of the Dalit organization also met the Senior Superintendent of Police regarding harassment with people
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki police sunwaayee ke mood main nahin he or ulta un par aropiyon ko bachaane kaa aarope madh rahi he
 In such a situation, he will now knock on the court
 haalanki, police kaa kahana he ki vah sirf sabooton ke aadhaar par hi karrwai kar rahi he

 Azam alleged that Sonia tried to damage the constitutional system by favoring a female IAS officer
 ajam ne sonia ke patr ko ek stant qaraar diya or kaha ki dilli main agar upi cader ke kisi adhikari kaa utpeedan kiya jaataa he to ham bhi virodh darj karaayenge
 Azam's rebuke was also overturned by the Congress
 congress ke pradesh pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh ne ajam khan ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki sonia par ungali uthaane se pehle unhen apana str dekhnaa chahie
 Singh said, "sonia Gandhi is a leader of which level, she knows not only the country but also people from abroad

 But before seeing all this, a crowd of thousands wants to enter the huge assembly hall where the Prime Minister 10
 30 baje sammelan kaa udghaatan karne vaale hai
 Here they come
 manch par unke alaava videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, teen pradeshon ke rajyapal, jharkhand ke mukhyamantri or kuch anya mantri virajman ho gaye
 There was no place on the stage for anyone who read and wrote in Hindi
 aayojan madhya pradesh main tha, isliye chouhan kaa haq banataa tha, sabakaa swaagat karne kaa
 But he remained focused on how Modi is hoisting the flag of Hindi in the world
 vivaadon ke lambey daur se uktaae chouhan ne modi kii tulana sidhe mahatma gandhi se kii or kaha ki baapu ke baad modi duusare aise gujarati hai jo hindi ko vishwapatal par laa rahe hai
 He had to clarify that the conference is not on Hindi literature but on language
 yahi baat sushamaa ne doharaai
 This was Chauhan's helplessness, because a day before the famous Hindi poet Rajesh Joshi had held a press conference to protest against the neglect of the writers

 Along with Vijay Bahadur Singh, Bhopal's literary fraternity lives

 In his speech, the Prime Minister ignored the traditional thinking of the RSS about the language and caught Kabir's line "bhasha Bahta Neer"
 ve bole ki hindi ko anya bhashaaon se upyogi shabd lene chahie
 Presenting his own example as usual, Modi told how he learned Hindi by giving tea to the milkmen of Uttar Pradesh
 kaarykram kaa bahishkaar karne ke baavjood dow
 Vijay Bahadur Singh said, "what Modi said about the language is right
" par badi ajeeb daleel he ki sammelan sahitya par nahin, bhashaa par he
 Language certainly originates from folk
 lekin bhashavid, sahityakar, kavi or bhashaa vigyaani hi to uski chakri karte hai or kaale aksharon main nai peedi tak le jate hai
 In such a situation, it is bullying not to ask litterateurs in the name of language
 ” joshi ne sawaal uthaaya, “sammelan kaa makasad duniya main hindi kaa prasar karnaa he, to bhopal jaise hindibhashi shahar main hindi sammelan kyon
 "actually, Minister of State for External Affairs General V

 The literary fraternity had already sat down with Singh stating that “the drinkers have not been invited
 ”khayr, modi ke bhaashan or ve
 K
 singh ke abujh aabhaar pradarshan ke baad sammelan shuru hua
 In various meetings, many topics such as Hindi in foreign policy, Hindi in computers, Hindi in government work, pure Hindi in journalism were discussed in secret
 gupt isliye kyonki patrakaron kaa in sabhakkshon main pravesh varjit tha
 It was a different thing if someone sneaked into camouflage
 tisare din 12 sitambar ko grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaarykram kaa samaapan kiya
 Many Indian and foreign Hindi servants were honored on the stage
 inamen se zyaadaatar logon ke yogadan se hindibhashi parichit nahin
 Prabhakar Shrotriya was the biggest name among those honored
 par india today ke poochne par ve bhi prasann to nahin dikheh “baaten to bahut sari huin par asal sawaal kriyanvayan kaa he
 He also expressed displeasure at the lack of proper honors at the conference for litterateurs
 sammelan main hindi ko lekar kai mahatvakankshi faisle kiye jane kaa daawa he
 However, the character of these decisions is similar to the decisions being made in every conference since 1975, which could not hit the ground

 In his book Vyomkesh Darvesh, Vishwanath Tripathi quoted it as, "you found a man (munshi Premchand) who truly recognized the power of your language (hindi), but sadly, Vidhata snatched it away
 tumhaari bhashaa main badi shakti or badi sambhaavnaaen hai
 "the Prime Minister also said this in his speech that he knows the power of Hindi

And what are you people doing that has upset the government? -loktantric rup se agar zyaadaatar chaatr yah kehete hai ki unhen vah adhyaksh ke rup main sweekaar nahin he to unako vahaan nahin hona chahie
 - It is being done in the board in a very planned manner and its purpose is to take away their rights from the students
 -aresas kii vichaardhaara suniyojit tareeke se saamaanya logon yaa soch ko aage badhaane kaa rahaa he
 - This is not happening in your school, it is being done on a large scale across the board
 -aap ek kam kaabil aadmi ko sabhi ke upar laakar bitha rahe hai or doosraa aadmi jo kaabil he, vah kisi ke neeche rahane ko taiyaar nahin he
 PM is the power center in BJP, all decisions are made there

 - i am with you in this battle
 -yahaan jo baatcheet ho rahi he, usamen kaha jaataa he ki aap hamase sahamat hon or agar aap nahin hote to aapako kuchal diya jaataa he
 He calls you anti-hindu and anti-national for silencing people

 Talking to the students, Rahul said: -jo halaat paidaa hue hai, usamen aisa kya he, jisane aap logon ko is tarah se pareshaan kar diya ki aap sadakon par virodh-pradarshan kar rahe hai? or aap log aisa kya kar rahe hai, jisane sarkaar ko pareshaan kar diya he? -democratically if most of the students say that they are not accepted as president then they should not be there
 -ye bahut hi suniyojit tareeke se board main kiya ja rahaa he or iskaa uddeshy chaatro se unka adhikaar chin lenaa he
 -RSS ideology has been to advance the general people or thinking in a planned way
 -ye aapke skool main nahin ho rahaa he, ye board main bade paimaane par kiya ja rahaa he
 - You are putting a less capable man on top of everyone and the other man who is capable is not willing to live under anyone
 -bijepi main piem hi power centre he, vahaan saare faisle vahi karte hai
 -the question is how much strength are you willing to fight against such a situation
 -main aapaki is ladaai main aapke saath hum
 - In the conversation that is happening here, it is said that you agree with us and if you are not, you are crushed
 -logon kaa munh band karne ke liye vah aapako hindu virdohi or raashtra virdohi kehete hai
 - Why do you think they want only one ideology in this country? After all, what is the reason that they do not want to welcome different ideologies or thinking in this country? -aapkaa drushtikon pratirodh kaa hona chahie, sirf skool ke bheetar nahin, balki baahar bhi
 -no one is more powerful today than you
 -yah ek bahut hi romaanchak film hogi ki kaise samoochee bharat sarkaar 250 chaatro ko kinare lagaana chaahati he
 This is just a small fight, the real fight is one in which we have to carry forward the real ideology of our country
 -aapako is vakt jo zakhm die gaye hai, aapako usase mili dard kaa sahi istemaal karnaa chahie
 i strongly oppose the privatization of this institution and my party Congress will not support it either
 -hamaare desh kaa sabase safal shiksha santhaan ve hai, jo sarkari hai
 These include iits, iims
 -aapaki or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii soch main ek mul fark he, aapke liye yah santhaan aapke astitv kaa ek hissaa he
 For them, this institute is just a building
 unhen aisa lagata he ki gyaan sirf unke paas he, jise vah sabko dena chaahate hai, jabaki aapaki or meri soch yah he ki gyaan aapke bheetar he, jise baahar laana he
 Earlier on reaching the Congress office, Rahul also faced opposition from BJP
 unhen yahaan bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne kaale jhande dikhaae
 Actually, there is a demand of FTII students that Gajendra Chauhan is not eligible for the post of FTII President, hence he should be removed from this post
 ab chaatro ne rahul gandhi se madad kii guhaar lagaai he ki ve is mudde ko sansad main uthaaen
 Students persist in the demand to reorganize the FTII Governing Council
 haalanki ve centre sarkaar se apni maangen manwaane main abhi tak asafal rahe hai
 The students have written a letter to Rahul Gandhi, stating their issues and have demanded to reach the voice of the students in Parliament
 ucch shiksha sansthaanon par sarkaar kii dakhlandaazi or hamalon ke khilaaf chaatr rahul gandhi se apil kar rahe hai ki vah sansad tak is mudde ko le jaaen
 Recently Rahul Gandhi had raised his voice against the government's ban on IIT Madras' controversial 'ambedkar Periyar Study Circle' and last month the government lifted the ban from the APSC
 tippaniyan FTII students are hoping that Rahul Gandhi will help them in solving this issue by joining their issue
 isse pehle FTII chaatr 3 july ko dilli main soochna evam prasaaran mantri arun jetali se mulaakaat kar chuke hai, lekin is baithak main koi samaadhaan nahin niklaa
 The students alleged that they were being pressured to withdraw their strike and threatened to privatize the institute
 somvaar ko filmkaar vidhu vinod chopra or raju hiraani ne dilli main phir se arun jetali se mulaaqaat kii or institute ke mudde hal karne ke alaava FTII main suraksha badhaane kii maang kii
 The students now want to take their agitation to Delhi and a big rally has been organized in Delhi on 3 August
 -jo halaat paidaa hue hai, usamen aisa kya he, jisane aap logon ko is tarah se pareshaan kar diya ki aap sadakon par virodh-pradarshan kar rahe hai? or aap log aisa kya kar rahe hai, jisane sarkaar ko pareshaan kar diya he? -democratically if most of the students say that they are not accepted as president then they should not be there

 mijuki kaa maananaa he ki jo log screen ke saamne centre vaali seat lete hai ve aatmavishvasi or nirnaayak hote hai

 mijuki apni theory ke samarthan main daleel dete hai ki iske liye vyakti kaa drudh nishchayi or pehle se yojana banane vaala hona jaruri he
 If you take the back seat from the screen, it means that you love peace
 lekin mijuki kehete hai ki agar aap dur kii seat kaa chunaav karte hai to aap thode sankochi swabhaav ke hai or aapako dusron se prabhavit hone kaa dar lagata he
 Those who are more socially active and who like to live among people choose the front row seat right in front of the screen
 mijuki ke mutabik, kyonki in siton par baithne se sirf or sirf paradaa najar aata he
 And the people who choose these seats make a complete connection with someone while talking to them
 agar aap screen se thodaa hatakar bich vaali pankti main jaanane waalon ke bich baithna pasand karte hai to iskaa matlab he ki aapako apni personal spes chahie or aap keval unheen logon ke prati jhukaav mahasoos karte hai, jinke saath aapako lagata he ki aap jaise hai vaise rah sakate hai
 Mizuki argues that if you take a back corner seat inside the hall, you are the person who wants to know what is going on around him but does not have the confidence to involve himself in it
 agar front corner par baithna aapkaa style he to aap aise shaks hai jise asuvidha manjuur he or mijuki saavdhaan karte hai ki log aapaki is kamajori kaa phayda uthaa sakate hai

 This year's draw was extremely cold compared to last year
 didie ke mutabik property main mandi kii maar ke chalate is baar zyada aavedak skim main shaamil nahin hue
 Despite this, those whose names came to the DDA flats in the draw, they looked very happy, while those whose names were not in the draw this time, they returned with a disappointed face
 aapako bataa den ki didie 2018 march tak 20,000 makaanon kii nai skim laane vaala he
 There are 85 HIG flats under the DDA scheme, which cost from 54 lakh to 1 crore three lakh

 Whose price ranges from 31 lakh to 74 lakh
 elayeeji 11757 flats hai jinaki keemat 14
 50 lakh to thirty lakhs
 janata flats 372 hai, jinaki keemat 7 se kareeb 13 lakh rupee tak he
 These flats are built in areas such as Rohini, Dwarka, Narela, Vasant Kunj, Jasola, Pitampura, Paschim Vihar, and Sirspur
 dilli hoicourt ke purv jaj es
 N
 agarwal kii adhyakshata main didie houseing skim kaa dra nikaala gaya
 Among the successful allottees, Nageshwar Rao was first named in the Physically Disabled category, who was allotted a HIG flat in Dwarka
 isi tarah general category main neha mehta kaa naam pehle aavanti ke taur par aayaa, jinhen dwarka menelaiji flatsmila
 Pradeep Kumar became the first allottee in the SC category to get a MIG flat
 flats milane kii khushi logon ke chehre par saaf najar aa rahi thi
 Praveen Upadhyay and his mother living in a government residence on Mandir Marg got a MIG flat in Rohini, though they applied for a HIG flat
 praveen upaadhyaay ne kaha ki apana ghar milane kii khushi se bada kuch nahin he
 Yes, the house will be a little small, but it will satisfy itself
 haalanki houseing skim ke dra ke baad kai log niraash bhi najar aae
 Even after applying for years, every time some people were very disappointed due to disappointment, there were some who kept the intention of trying their luck again next year
 didie skim ke tahat safal aavedakon ko ek maheene ke andar alotment letters de diya jayega, jiske baad bhugtan ke liye 3 maheenon kaa vakt diya jayega
 If payment is not made after 3 months, then payment can be made with interest rate of 12% for next three months
 lekin alotment letters jari hone ke 6 maheene biit jane ke baad flats kaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya, to aavanton radd kar diya jayega
 According to the DDA, the economic subsidy being given under the Prime Minister's Housing Scheme will get maximum benefit this time
 flop maani ja rahi he skimdidie kii is skim ko kai kaarnon se flop kaha ja saktaa he
 The first is that better quality and connectivity houses are easily available in NCR at lower prices than the DDA is selling houses
 doosraa ye ki didie kii houseing skim main zyaadaatar flats elayeeji rahe, wo bhi aise elayeeji flats jinhen 2014 kii skim main log sarender kar chuke the
 In the current scheme, about 10,000 flats in 11757 LIG flats are rejected by the previous scheme
 upar se didie ne market main mandi ke baavjood flats kii keemton main jarurat ke mutabik kami nahin kii, lihaaja aavedan ke liye form biken 90,000 lekin sirf 46080 logon hi skim main shaamil hue, ye halaat tab hai, jab didie ne pichhali skim vaali loking period kii shart ko khatm kar diya
 That is, as soon as the house comes out, people can sell it in the open market
 haalanki didie kaa maananaa he ki is baar houseing skim main kai khaamiyon ko dur kiya gaya he
 The DDA has announced that preparations to launch a better housing scheme of 20,000 houses by the month of March 2018 are almost in its final stages
 lekin saal 2017 kii skim ko mili thande rispance ke kaaran kai safal aavedakon ne agar flats sarender kiye to didie kii saakh par gaharaa asar padane kii gambhir ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa

 aspx? id = 3069 mahabali hanuman se asht siddhiyon or nau nidhiyon kaa vardaan praapt karne ke liye apaar bhakthi or satat sadhana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is said that austerity is as deep
 fal kii prapti utani hi sunishchit hoti jaati he
 We are going to tell you how these eight miraculous achievements and nine funds are finally found
 
 
 siddhiyon or nidhiyon kii prapti keval unheen bhaktaraj hanuman kii sharan main jane se sambhav he
 According to experts, planets also have special importance in making the sum of siddhis and funds in life, so today we will also tell you about those planetary positions in the horoscope that can help you in the attainment of siddhis and funds
 koun se grah se judi hai siddhiyaan or nidhiyaan ?- mangal ko mantra shakti or urja kaa swami mana jaataa he- mangal se hi tapasya kii shakti milti he- mangal majboot ho to vyakti ko nidhiyaan saralata se mil jaati hai- lekin siddhiyaan tabhi mil paati hai jab mangal ke saath brihaspati bhi majboot hedgar aapaki kundali main bhi aise yoga ban rahe hai to hi aapako siddhiyaan or nidhiyaan saralata se mil sakengi
 On the contrary, for the attainment of siddhis and funds in any situation one has to use immense power of hard penance and devotion
 aise bhaktavatsal mahabali hanuman kii aath siddhiyon or nau nidhiyon kaa ansh maatr mil jaae to sampurna jivan sanvar jaataa he isiilie to bhakt apane bhagwaan se in siddhiyon or nidhiyon kii kaamana karte hai lekin in chamatkaari siddhiyon or nidhiyon ko praapt karne se pehle kuch baton ke bare main jaananaa behad jaruri he
 Important things related to siddhis and funds- One should not do meditation for attainment of siddhis - if attainment of siddhis is done by itself, then it is God's grace - after attainment of siddhis one misuses it and becomes a sinner
 Prayer can be done but this prayer should be sattvik - do not go on any wrong path to get funds Come - Even if you get immense wealth or funds by the grace of God, then it should be used in a good item, so you too should worship and meditate on Bajrangbali with a sincere heart
 agar mahabali prasann hue to vardaan bhi denge or wo vardaan aapako siddhiyon or nidhiyon ke rup main bhi mil saktaa he lekin iske liye aapako swayan ko is yogya bananaa hoga

 Sinha, one of the star campaigners of the party, said in an informal conversation on Tuesday that the new president of the party, Nitin Gadkari, was his younger brother and said, "whatever i had to say on the issue of national executive, i am the president of the party and the party in the Lok Sabha and i have told the Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj and i have nothing further to say on this question
 'saath hi sinha ne jor dete hue kaha ki apni bhaawanaaon kii abhivyakti main unhone kisi bhi tareeke se party kaa anushaasan nahin todaa he
 Sinha, who came to Lucknow in connection with the promotion of his son Luv Sinha's debut film 'sadiya', said that the party should introspect before the crucial elections to the Bihar Legislative Assembly and come out strong and united by ending factionalism
 unhone kaha, 'is chunavi varsh main party ke liye jaruri he ki vah santhnik drushti se apni sabhi samasyaon ko sulajhaaye or haal hi main hue vidhansabha upachunaav main party ke pradarshan kii samiksha kare
 While praising Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Sinha said that the Chief Minister is doing a good job, but with the result not being favorable, it is natural that there is something wrong
 unhone 'bihar shining' ke badale 'bihar rising' kaa naaraa dete hue kaha ki bihar rising behatar naaraa he, kaaran ki rajya ke logon kii abhi bahut si samasyaon kaa samaadhaan baaki he
 Saying that 'I was neither invited to the Bihar Day celebrations nor to the Chief Minister's programs,' Sinha said in his characteristic and funny manner that it seems that some people are scared of my popularity

 sahyogi party janata dal (you) main mahila aarakshan ke sawaal par ubhari alag-alag awaajon ke bare main sinha ne kaha ki yah acha nahin he, kyonki isse party ke bheetar vibhaajan kii charchaa uthanaa swaabhaavik he

 * On October 7, 1914, that voice was born in an aristocratic family living in Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh
 maa-baap ne bade pyaar se naam rakhaa, 'bibbi'
 Bibby fell in love with music at the age of 7, when she heard a song by theater actress Chanda
 us jamaane ke mashhoor sangeet ustad ata mohammad khan, abdul vaahid khan or patiala gharaane ke ustad jhande khan se unhen shastreey sangeet kii diksha dilaai gai
 'ye na thi hamari kismat, jo visaal-e-yar hota hai', 'aye muhabbat tere anjam pe rona aaya' is one of the most famous ghazals of Akhtari Bai
 *saal tha 1930
 Bibi was now in a position
 15 kii umr main unhone manch par pehla kalam pesh kiya to saamne baithi mashhoor kavyitri sarojini naidu fida ho gayi or khush hokar unhen ek sari bhent kii
 The words of this ghazal were, 'tune bute e harjai tune bute harjai, something like this, i would see your face every scene
 ' ghazal khatm kar vah aakhir main vah ek kishor hadabdaahat ke saath kahati hai, 'meraa naam akhtari bai faijabad'*bibbi bahut jald samaan adhikaar se ghazal, thumari, tappa, daadaraa or khyaal gane lageen
 Later, Hindustan called him 'mallika-e-ghazal' and conferred with Padma Bhushan
 hindustan main shastreey raagon par aadhaarit ghazal gayaki ko oonchaaiyon par pahunchane kaa sehara akhtari bai ke sir hi bandhana chahie

 Sarojini Naidu and classical singer Pandit Jasraj were great admirers of hers, so Kaifi Azmi was also mesmerized by listening to her ghazals in the voice of Begum Sahiba
 1974 main begum akhtar ne apane janmdin ke maukey par caphi azmi kii yah ghazal gaai
 'hear me, my love, they are officers from them, all are strangers here, who knows whom' * Akhtari had everything, but she believed the woman's biggest success to be a successful wife
 isi chahat ne unki mulaakaat lakhanu main barrister ishtiya ahamed abbasi se karai
 The meeting soon turned into nikah and with it became Akhtari Bai, Begum Akhtar, but after this due to social restrictions, Begum Sahiba had to leave the song
 duniya kii inaayaat ne unka dil tod diya
 Begum Akhtar: Gammagin-si ik aawaz * It was the same for him to give up singing, like a fish living without water
 ve kareeb paanch saal tak nahin ga sakin or biimaar rahane lageen
 It was at this time that her return to music proved beneficial for her declining health and she returned to the recording studio in 1949
 unhone lakhanu radio stesan main teen ghazal or ek daadaraa gaaya
 After this, tears came out of his eyes and he turned to music seminars
 yah silsilaa dobaaraa shuru hua, to phir kabhi nahin rukaa
 * On October 30, 1974, Begum Sahiba's body said goodbye to the world, but her voice was an agreement to comfort the future generations, who even today, boys with iphones in hand, continue to write 'begum Akhtar Ghazals' on youtube

 But in my view, Yuvraj and Harbhajan have been made scapegoats
 "tippaniyan Gavaskar said, "if you look at Harbhajan's performance in the Mumbai Test, he bowled some 20 overs (21 overs) and took two wickets
 yadi bharat mumbai main haar gaya to yah samuhik asafalataa thi
 Yuvraj scored more than 30 runs

 in puraskaron se sammanit jayant vishnu narlikar vigyaan kshetra ke janemaane chehre hai
 Born in 1938, Jayant spent his studies from BHU, honors from many big institutions including Cambridge University and his journey thereafter with science
 janyat ko unki kitaab virus ke liye haal hi main 2015 ke sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Read here the excerpts of Jayant's famous book Virus, after which you will be able to understand the fear of the virus better
 virus kitaab kaa ek anshakmera nambar 153 se jagataap baahar niklaa to uske man main chaaron dishaao main daudane vaale vichaaron kaa maano trephic jam ho gaya tha
 As one thought-series progressed, the other came in the way
 or isaki vajah thi pradhanmantri ke saath hui mantranaa!south block se baahar nikalate hi thandi hawa ne uskaa swaagat kiya or uske dimag ko thanda kar diya
 When he saw the clock, it was ringing
 use bombay kii chaar-pachaas kii flite pakadani thi
 Provided that she has not canceled due to the morning mist! His green car was parked in the car-park
 uske driver sardarji anya driveron se gapshap ladaakar samay bitaa rahe the lekin jagataap ke baahar nikalate hi tatparta se hajir ho gaye
 "chalo Palam!" Indira Gandhi International Airport - Instead of taking such a long name, Delhiites still loved the old name
 ‘‘haa ji
 
 
 On domestic? '' Sardarji asked
 ‘‘haa, indian airline vaale terminal par,’’ gaadi start hote-hote jagataap ne dekha ki ab mausam sudhar rahaa he
 India Gate was clearly visible
 palam to ab khul gaya hoga
 But some of the airlines will have been canceled and some will be running late by two hours
 par trunk root hone ke naate bombay-dilli vimaan sevaayen band to nahin hongi
 When the results of the examination are declared on the notice board of the college, the examiner's heart flutters while looking at them
 narayan vinayak jagataap ek hoshiyaar chaatr rahaa tha jise apni karmthata par sadaa puraa vishwaas rahaa
 Therefore, he had neither difficulty nor concern in finding his name in the declared results
 par vahi jagataap airport pahunchne par saamne lage vimaan sevaaon ke nirdhaarit kaarykram ko padhane se kataraata tha
 Don't know how many hours have to wait
 aaj bhi usee dhaddhadaate dil se usne kaale board par chock se likhe aksharon ko padhaa or uski jaan main jaan ai
 The flight to Bombay was still on time
 ‘‘kyon ji, aapane bombay kii udaan samay par kaise laga di? or sab udaanen to deree se chal rahi hai?’’ usne kuch mazaakia swar main check-in counter par poocha
 The counter-man said with a dry smile, "brother, the aircraft is going to be late
 par hamane banaras jane vaala vimaan hathiyaakar bombay ko divert kar diya
 Our minister is going on it, isn't it? " So the minister hijacked the flight to Benares
 mantriyon ke saath yatra karne ke kuch phaayde bhi hote hai
 But what will happen to the people of poor Benares? Let's go! All Is Fair in Love and Air Travel
 aisa sochate hue jagataap security se guzarakar deparchar lounj kii ore niklaa
 There he got an answer to her question
 ‘‘hai najya! idhar kahaan?’’ ek pukaar ai
 There were very few friends who called him 'nazya', for a long time
 usne ghumkar dekha
 ''ajay! How are you here 
 
 kya bengalore udaan kii baat joh rahe ho?’’ ajay maharana se haath milakar usne poocha
 "no, just returning from South Africa
" 
 
 vahaan seminar tha
 But i had to meet my old brothers and brothers who have settled there
 or uski report maa ko dene ke liye katak ja rahaa hum
 It was the wishes of the late father that i fulfilled
 par yah saali vimaan seva chale to!’’ usne khijkar kaha
 "when is your flight?" "ask when was it brother
 paanch baje nikalne vaali thi
 Security check has also been done
 banaras hote hue yah flite bhubaneshwar jaaegi
 Now telling that the flight has been rescheduled
 kyon? kaaran bhagwaan jane!’’ ajay bolaa
 The reason i know, Jagtap thought mind-to-mind, but did not say anything in the manifest
 agar kaaran jaahir ho to tahalaka much jayega
 He said, "reschedule; These braves discovered a new word
 pehle kaha karte the ‘dilade’
 
 
 The plane will go late
 ab der hui, is baat ko bhi sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate
 Let's drink coffee tum mujhe dakshin africa ke kisse sunaao
 The lounge had a coffee-machine
 lekin ‘self sarvice’ ke liye bhi maanav-shakti istemaal karne vaala bharat anokhaa desh he
 Jagtap bought two tokens of five rupees each, which was put on the machine by the person appointed on the machine, and showed the cups of coffee
 coffee chakhkar maharana kaa mizaaj shant hua
 He said, "nazya! Must visit South Africa when you get a chance
 abhi sankraman kii sthiti se guzarate us desh main to taazgi or vividhta he vah shaayad das-bees saal baad na dikhaai de
 
 
 "" So tell me some experiences there! there is time
 ’’ ‘‘najya! dont rab it in bhai
 Time is enough khayr! bahut lambi daastaan he
 
 
 As our film-goers say
 ’’ajay apni daastaan sunaate-sunaate mood main aa gaya
 Did not even know how one hour was spent
 ekaek bombay kii flite kii ghoshnaa ne donon ko chaukanna kar diya
 Jagtap woke up with Ajay
 get par yatriyon kii qatari ban rahi thi
 Suddenly he remembered one thing
 ‘‘ajay
 
 
 In many of your details, there was talk of computer breakdown
 kya iske peeche koi sajeesh he?’’ usne poocha
 "nazya!" i was about to say, but this departure call was announced in between
 khayr, sankshep main yahi ki us desh main computarigeshan teji se chal rahaa he
 But i do not agree to believe that the mood of the computer sometimes deteriorates and the businesses that depend on it come to a standstill, so were these incidents
 sabhi jagah virus kaa andeshaa tha or yah virus soch-samajhakar computer network main choda gaya he
 i am not an expert but i have used computer quite a lot
 usee aadhaar par main kahoonga ki is navdith desh kii vyavastha ko bigaadane ke liye jaan-boojhkar chaal chali ja rahi he
 Why, why shocked? ”jagtap held himself as Ajay was staring at him with surprise
 apane man main daudane vaale vichaaron ko sambhalate hue usne giyar badla, ‘‘nahin, ekaek mujhe yaad ai
 Did you have to take a yellow fever injection to go there? ”he asked
 ‘‘nahin to,’’ ajay bolaa
 But still there was curiosity on his face
 ‘‘jab tumne virus kii baat kii to mujhe pile bukhaar kii yaad ai
 i always shrug with needle ’’‘‘abe tumhaare purvaj marathe talwaar chalaate the or tum sooyee se ghabaraate ho?’’ hansate hue ajay ne vidaa lee
 But Jagtap had just held her hand
 vah bolaa, ‘‘par us computer virus ke bare main kya nateeja niklaa? kya vah kisi sajeesh ke tahat kiya gaya tha? tumhen aisa kyon laga ki vah desh main araajaktaa failaane ke iraade se failaayaa gaya?’’‘‘yah ek sambhaavna maatr he
 Otherwise, what should we consider to be the same type of virus found in so many different places? ”ajay said
 ‘‘computer account main ghuskar chhedhkhani karanevaale havers to kaaphi hai
 
 
 Do you have any evidence that there is a strong conspiracy behind it? "" No evidence, but the way a lot of things are being kept secret at a high level there, it seems to be that
 
 
 acha ab bhaago tumhaari bas nikalne ko he
 "boarding information was flashing"
 vimaan karmchaaree yatriyon ko ghur rahe the
 Jagtap pounced towards the gate
 vimaan yathasamay udaan bhar kar das hajaar meter oonchaai par pahunchaa
 Permission to open seat box was announced
 par jagataap ajay kii daastaan par vichaar kar rahaa tha
 "many things are being kept secret at a high level there
" 
 
 ’’ ajay ne kaha tha
 Her brother Rajiv had an M
 pi
 i had a lot of friendship with him - said Ajay
 sambhav he, vahiin se use pataa chalaa ho
 By the way today, the Prime Minister had said the same to everyone
 usne gopneeyata kii shapath lee thi
 ''
 
 
 aaj desh par ek aisa sankat gujara he
 
 
 He did not forget these early words of the Prime Minister
 kya anya deshon ke aise hi samachar unhen ‘thru oficial channel’ mili the? subah kaa charchaa-satr ek baar phir uske samaran-patal se gujara
 The crisis on the country, what kind of it? The attack of the neighboring nation? The internal divisive elements? The terrorists? There were many synonyms
 yadi anya deshon par bhi aisi hi guzar rahi he to yah sankat keval hamaara apana nahin he
 But as long as the problem is on our head, we have to deal with it
 or teenon sena-pramukhon ke apane-apane anubhav, sthiti kitni najuk ban gai he isaki yaad dilaate the
 The stories he narrated were arousing deep concern because in today's computer age - where work is being done to fix and control the system more or less in all areas, what about the craze of computers The estimate of the disturbances that can pass, was also very worrying
 sena-pramukhon ke anubhavon ko dekhte hue lagata tha ki koi desh kii suraksha-pranali ko hi apana lakshya bana rahaa tha
 "due to computer failure, the exchange of our messages from the border areas stops," the air commander said
 sthal or nausena pramukhon ne bhi sahmati main sir hilaae the
 "so now we have to depend on messengers running with chapattis at night?" Said the Prime Minister with an irritation
 unhen yaad aa rahaa tha jon masters kaa upanyaas ‘da nite ranrs of bangal’
 
 
 Written on the background of the 1857 War of Independence
 angreji satta ke viruddh rachi sajeesh kii mantranaayen aise daudanevaale sandesavahak idhar-se-udhar pahunchaate the
 
 
 Through chapatis
 general battara sandarbh samaj gaye or bole, ‘‘sar! waisi baat nahin
 We are not going to go past 150 years
 jab nai takanic-yah aadhunik computerchaalit sandesh yantranaa-istemaal hoti he, tab kabhi-na-kabhi, kuch-na-kuch bigadane kii sambhaavna avashya rahati he
 But now the situation has progressed beyond those initial accidents
 computer sankane ke peeche koi sajeesh he
 "" Yes sir! These mistakes are hardware or software needs to be discovered
 hamaare visheshgy kehete hai, puri computer pranali main virus ghusaa he
 "" Virus? "the Prime Minister asked in amazement
 ‘‘ji, main is baat ko samajhaata hum,’’ pradhanmantri kii ore dekhte hue professor vinod sharma bich main hi tapak pade
 They could not stay in any discussion meeting without saying much
 pradhanmantri unki is aadat se achdi tarah parichit the
 He allowed a few smiles and Sharmaji climbed into his high gear
 ‘‘jaise praaniyon ke sharir main honevaali prakritik jaivik kriyaaon main adnga daalanevaale rog-jeevanu yani virus hua karte hai, vaise hi computer kii tark-vishuddh kaary-pranali main adnga daalanevaale computer program hote hai, inhen bhi virus hi kehete hai
 The smooth functioning of the computer can be changed through these programs i
e
, the command given to the computer
 ‘‘virus ghusaane kii shuruyaat 1980-90 ke dashak main hui
 The popularity of computers increased rapidly in the same decade
 bade karyaalayon or vaigyanik prayogshaalaon kii deevaaron ko phandakar computer jan saamaanya ke ghar main ja ghusaa
 This can also be useful in our daily work, information about it started spreading in the public and a new environment of writing programs or mandates given to computers for such tasks arose
 jaise in aagyapatron ne apni upyuktata kii vajah se unchi keemat hasil kerani shuru kii vaise hi copirite ke prashn bhi uth khadey hue
 If a cassette of a singer comes into the market, then copying and selling it is considered a violation of the Copyright Act
 ‘‘computer ajna-patr bhi copy karke bechnewale bahaduron par kaabo paane ke liye mul ajna-patr lekhakon ne virus kaa istemaal kiya
 Those who illegally copied the orders were able to get even a virus into that order! And this virus also spread to other commands of his computer
 sankshep main yah gaiyrkanoonee istemaal kii sajaa hoti thi
 Conversely, if the computer program was used to pay the price of royalty, then the virus could not show its effect
 ‘‘par yah baat yaheen tak simit nahin rahi
 When a virus enters a personal computer, it also comes on a diskette or floppy disk inserted in it
 phir yadi us disket kaa istemaal kisi anya computer par ho jaae to virus vahaan bhi ghus jaataa he
 This infectious disease probably reaches even farther through the network because even remote computers in the network are connected in a series
 ’’‘‘professor sharma! aapane apane saral dhang se mul prashn par prakaash to daalaa kintu admiral sahab yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki unhen peedit karanevaala virus aayaa kahaan se,’’ pradhanmantri ke saumy shabdon main nihit halkaa-sa vyangy dow
 Did not miss Ramachandran's cockpit Looking at Jagtap, he smiled his eyes with a mild smile
 vastav main jagataap sharma or ramachandran-donon kii kadra karata tha
 But despite working hard, he could not understand why the two are so eager to degrade each other in the government environment
 pehle rajdurbar main do pratibhashali sangeetkaaron, sahityakaron, chitrakaaron main hode evam irshyaa kaa maahaul rahaa karata tha
 
 
 Can scientists not live beyond such human feelings? He himself adopted a policy of befriending these two personalities, but he was, unfortunately, soon to be rewarded
 pradhanmantri ne aage kaha, ‘‘
 
 
 i would like to hear a comment about the virus from a well-known computer sector expert, Sabyoda
 ’’‘‘sabyoda,’’ yani sabyasachi babu yaa sabyasachi mukhopadhyaay saamaanya charchaa main, gapshap main apni mitbhashita ke liye mashhoor the
 If someone calls them to tell their opinion, they would not hesitate to speak clearly
 pradhanmantriji ke poochne par unhone kaha: ‘‘pradhanmantriji, main pehali baar is virus ke bare main sun rahaa hum
 On hearing the talks of the Chiefs, it is proved that this is a unique virus, which is absolutely necessary to investigate
 jaisaa sharmaji ne spasht kiya, virus flopy yaa disket ke madhyam se failata he
 But here we have to control the epidemic spreading from the network
 hamen pehle yah dekhnaa he ki ghuse hue virus ko baahar kaise nikaalen
 Then, you have to know how it entered inside despite the top-top security, so that it does not happen again
 teesri baat yah khojane kii he ki kis vyakti yaa santhaan ne yaa desh ne hamaare saath yah chhedhkhani kii he
 "sabyoda kept quiet saying this
 un jaise mitbhaashi ke liye yah ek lambaa bhaashan tha
 Jagtap raised his hand for permission to say something
 pradhanmantriji kaa dhyaan uski ore aakarshith hua
 And suppressing Sharmaji, eager to speak, he asked Jagtap to speak
 ‘‘main yahi kahana chaahoonga ki yadi yah virus network par failaa he to electronic mail ke maarg se uske aane kii sambhaavna he
 Today there are so many networks of e-mail that have connected the country
 kya aap ucchstareey or gopneey maarg se yah jaankaree hasil kar sakate hai ki anya deshon main bhi aisi kathinaaiyaan mahasoos kii ja rahi hai
 
 
 Maybe they too are suffering like us and we do not know about them due to privacy, ”said Narayan
 ‘‘narayan kii salaah vichaarneey he,’’ ramachandran bole, ‘‘durbhaagya se kai rashtron ko raashtra-vighatak aatankwaadiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The reasons may vary
 par aise maahaul main koi aniti se paise kamaanevaala anterrashtriya sanghathan virus banaakar yah gustaakhee kar rahaa hoga
 We know that arms are illegally imported and exported
 sambhav he, usee main ab virus bhi aa gaya ho!’’‘‘professor ramachandran lagata he james bond yaa dow
 Must have read the stories of Fu Manchu, "sharmaji said
 kuch der pehle ramachandran ne ankhen michakaai thim, yah baat sharmaji kii najar se nahin chhipi thi
 The information of Jagtap flowed from somewhere in the flow of laughter and laughter at Sharma's comment
 ab bombay jate samay us soochna par punarvichaar karte-karte jagataap ko usamen kaaphi majbootee dikhaai di
 Ajay Maharana's South African experience confirms that
 computer band ho gaye yaa sanak gaye
 
 
 Today here, tomorrow there
 
 
 aaj kam paimaane par to kal adhik vyapak rup se
 
 
 Were these incidents happening separately by mere coincidence or was there some inspiration behind them
 
 
 kisi anisht shakti kii? aatankwaad bhi aise hi failata he or kabhi-kabhi jab uskaa vyapak rup saamne aata he to kaaphi der ho chuki hoti he
 Is there no prior information to destroy these world-wide events tomorrow? yatri khaane-pine, gapshap ladaane yaa kuch padhane main lage the
 The atmosphere was so simple that Jagtap felt that his thoughts did not go astray from the real world
 Well, now that the plane was going from Delhi to Bombay, it was appropriate to leave the idea of delhi and think on the things of Bombay
 jis masale ke liye vah bombay ja rahaa tha, vah bhi kaaphi rangila sabit honevaala tha
 Jagtap c from his briefcase
 pi
 Snow wrote the 'masters' novel
 unnisvin sadi kii samaapti or beesvin sadi ke shuru hone par cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke ek college ke ‘master’ yani principal kaa chunaav kaise hua, inhen ghatnaon par aadhaarit vah upanyaas tha
 Perhaps the work he was going for should be the same, as he was a member of a 'search committee' to choose the director of Bombay's famous science institute
