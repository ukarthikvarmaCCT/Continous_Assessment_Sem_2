 Such cases are rare, Keith Edleman, a New York doctor, said that this is possible when such children are born after two separate sexual relationships
 vaise is tarah ke maamle kam hi paae jate hai
 a nurse said that she had a CD
 ek aisi sidi jisamen ek cabinet mantri or ek vidhayak kii nangi karatuut kaid he
 And if this CD becomes common then the state government will fall within three days
 par isse pehle ki yah sidi aam hoti khud nurse hi gaayab ho gai
 This is the story of Bhanwari Devi, who caused earthquake in the political corridors of Rajasthan
 koun thi bhavari devibhanwari devi kaa taalluk rajasthan kii nat birdari se tha
 She used to work as a nurse in a government hospital in Pannon town near Jodhpur
 uski shaadi bhi ho chuki thi
 But by modeling and making the Rajasthani album a ladder, she was dreaming of becoming the heroine of Rajasthani films
 lihaaja apane is khwab ko puraa karne ke liye vah kuch bhi kar sakati thi
 She was the same nurse after being taken to the village hospital and she too was missing from duty
 lihaaja gaanv waalon kii shikaayat par bhavari devi ko naukari se suspend kar diya gaya tha
 Used to claim the government to be demolished, Bhanwari Devi announced that she has a CD
 jiske baahar aa jane par rajasthan kii sarkaar teen din main gir jaaegi
 After all, what was in that CD that a state government of the country was being threatened to topple? What was it in that secret CD that the leaders' hands and feet were blooming? And what was it that the one who had the CD went missing? The first meeting with the minister was Bhanwari Devi's job
 lekin uski khubsuurati ke charche jodhpur se jaipur tak hone lage the
 She went to the area's MLA Malkhan Singh to save the job
 malakhan singh use jal sansaadhan mantri mahipal maderna ke paas le gaye
 Then both of them recommended Bhanwari Devi to the Collector
 sifarish rang laai or bhavari devi kaa nilamban naa sirf radd hua balki use nai posting apane ghar ke or najadik jaaliwada ke sarkari aspataal main mil gai
 The life of such a changed Bhanwari had taken place in the eyes of Bhanwari Devi, Malkhan Singh and Mahipal
 vakt ke saath-saath vah in donon kii kareebi ho gai
 After meeting the two leaders, Bhanwari had realized the power of power
 malakhan or maderna kii vajah se uski mulaakaat dhire-dhire baaki netaaon se bhi ho gai
 And then on seeing the life of Bhanwari Devi, who got a modest salary of seven-eight thousand, changed completely
 usne nayaa ghar banaaya
 Bought a new car
 bete-beti kaa daakhila nami skulon main karaayaa
 power
 
 
 sex or sajishyah sunne main chaahe kitna hi ajeeb kyon na lage
 But they always have a deep relationship
 or hakeekat bhi yahi he
 Whenever the blot on the drunkards of power is tainted, every time the reality of such a relationship comes out with a new story
 nurse bhavari devi or uski sidi kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi thi
 As soon as the leaders came to the notice, now Bhanwari was completely around the power
 bagaiyr dauty par jaae hi har maheene tankhwaah mil rahi thi
 There was talk about his relationship with Maderna
 lekin maamla satta kaa tha, to sabhi ne chup rahane main bhalaai samajhi
 On not getting the ticket, the blackmailing year till 2010, Bhanwari enjoyed a lot of power
 par achaanak baat bigadi gai
 Bhanwari's wishes were unbridled
 ab vah malakhan singh or mantri maderna ke saath apane rishton ke evaj main sidhe vidhansabha kaa tikat maang baithi
 Obviously both refused
 bas isi ke baad bhavari ne rishton ke un palon kii sidi banane kaa faisla kiya
 And Minister Maderna got caught in this trap
 bhavari ne donon netaaon ko blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya
 Both immediately made a distance from Bhanwari
 maderna ne bhavari ko dhamkaakar bhagayakai maheene tak mantri maderna or vidhayak malakhan singh bhavari se bhaagate rahe
 He kept avoiding Bhanwri
 is baat kaa ahsaas khud bhavari ko bhi tha
 So one day she suddenly reached Jaipur
 bijepi ke kuch vidhayakon or netaaon se mili
 And with that everything changed
 july 2011 kii baat he
 When Bhanwari Devi failed to contact Malkhan and Maderna, she reached the minister's official bungalow in Jaipur directly one day
 vahaan maderna ne use dhamka kar bhaga diya
 Under pressure, Bhanwari met some BJP leaders in Jaipur to pressurize Maderna and told them about the CD for the first time
 sidi kii khabar jaipur ke raajnneetik galiyaaron se hote hue media tak ja pahunchi
 And suddenly all the tussle between Minister Mahipal, MLA Malkhan Singh and Bhanwari Devi was dispelled
 teenon main ab samjhauta ho chukaa tha
 After this, the conversation between the three started again
 kehete hai ki majaboor hokar maderna ne bhavari devi ko sidi ke badale 60 lakh rupye dene kaa vaada kar liya tha
 
 
 And vanished Bhanwari Devi Bhanwari sold her car in August 2011
 usee kaa bakaayaa chaar lakh rupaya dene ke liye ek sitambar ko sohanlal naamak vyakti ne bhavari ko phone kar apane ghar bulaayaa
 Bhanwari left her house the same day to get the money and never returned home
 shuru main gharavaalon ne har taraf bhavari kon dhundha
 No clue of Bhanwari Davy was found for 12 days
 uske pati ne police main report likhaa di
 Amarchand, the husband of Bhanwari Devi, stirred the corridors of power by blaming the cabinet minister of Rajasthan Government, Mahipal Madernaak for the disappearance of her wife
 sibiai ko mila bhavari devi kesamamla hai profile hone kii vajah se police harakat main aa gai
 The minister and MLA were also under suspicion
 lihaaja police har kadam phoonk phoonk kar rakh rahi thi
 Police found out in the investigation that Bhanwari was last seen in Jodhpur on 1 September
 iske baad uske mobile phone kaa ricard sikar main uski maujuudagi dikhaa rahaa tha
 But no clue was found
 maamla badhata dekh rajya sarkaar ne dabaav main aakar is maamle kii jaanch rajasthan police se lekar sibiai ko saunp di
 The CBI wanted to know that the most important question in front of the CDBI was that who had trapped Bhanwari in the whirlpool of the CD? What was in that CD? And why did Bhanwari say that the government of Rajasthan would fall in three days if the CD was run? To understand the truth of the CD, it was necessary to know Bhanwari
 ek maamuli nurse bhavari kii asal jindagi main kya haisiyat or rutaba tha use parakhnaa jaruri tha
 And after examining him, the CBI finally reached the destination
 126 din baad khul gaya bhavari kaa rajgumshudagi ke thik 126 din pataa chalaa ki nurse bhavari devi mar chuki he
 Actually, Sohanlal Bishnoi, who bought a car from Bhanwari, was the nephew of MLA Malkhan Singh
 usee ne bhavari devi ko phone kar bataaya tha ki sidi ke badale saath lakh rupye lene use bilada janaa padegaa
 But he will get the money only when Raju Bhai will test the reality of the CD
 ek sitambar ko hi bhavari bas se bilada gai
 There Raju and one of his companions were waiting for Bhanwari in a Bolero jeep
 ye raju koi or nahin balki rajasthan kaa khoonkhaar apradhi shahabuddin tha
 Who came to deal with the CD as Raju
 aise hua tha bhavari kaa katlbhanvari ab sohanlal or shahabuddin ke bune jaal main funs chuki thi
 Raju watched the entire 52-minute film in the car's CD player
 is dauraan jeep lagaataar sadak par farrate bharti rahi
 Sohanlal was walking in a swift car behind the jeep
 taaki bhavari ko kisi bhi tarah kaa shaq naa ho
 Just in the evening, Bhanwari asked for money from Shahabuddin
 lekin raju ke anakani karne par bhavari ko shaq ho gaya
 He started making noise
 yah dekhakar sohanlal bhi bulero ke andar aa gaya or in teenon ne bhavari ko jeep kii seat ke neeche lita diya
 And Bhanwari was crushed to death by shoes
 bishnaram ne lagaaya tha laash ko thikaaneis sajeesh ke bich kii kadi tha sahiram
 He was a special henchman of Malkhan Singh and Mahipal Maderna
 jo jodhpur ke jyaati nagar ilaake se katl ke is plan ko monitor kar rahaa tha
 After Bhanwari's murder, he ordered Sohan Lal to hand over Bhanwari's corpse to Bishnaram, a criminal of Jalauda
 lihaaja sohanlal ne pipaad ilaake main laash bishnaram bishnoi ke hawaale kar di
 Now it was time for Bhanwari's corpse to be located, Bishanaram took the corpse to Luhwat Nahari Pulia in Jalaur forest and burnt the corpse there
 mantri or vidhayak gaye gelsibiai ne baad main jo khulaasa kiya uske mutabik bhavari ke katl kii pehali kadi vidhayak malakhan singh or duusari kadi purv cabinet mantrimahipal madernatha
 Bhanwari was blackmailing the minister Maderna through the CD
 us sidi main mantri aapattijanak haalat main bhavari devi ke saath tha
 All those involved in this murder case were people from Malkhan and Madherana
 baad main mahipal maderna ko naa sirf mantripad se istipha dena padaa
 Rather had to go to jail
 vahi haal malakhan singh kaa bhi hua

 The Hindu side will respond on Tuesday in this matter
 38wein din sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne shiduling ko lekar sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki court ne mere paksh ke jawaab ke liye samay tay nahin kiya tha
 Both Dhawan and Vaidyanathan submitted written arguments to the court
 dhawan ne gumbad ko lekar apane tark rakhe
 He said that no claim of Ram being born under the dome, offering flowers and offerings to the devotees there, has been proved
 yahaan gumbad ke neeche to trespassing kar log ghus aae the
 When worship was going on there, what does it mean to enter? This meant worship was being held outside

 There were frequent prayers

 Islamic law and the Quran are very complex
 hindu pakshakaar iske ek paksh ke aadhaar par hamaari vakf kii gai masjid ko khaarij nahin kar sakate
 The second is about the limit and the third is the possession
 dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh ke paas koi malikana haq kaa dastavej nahin he or naa hi tha
 This waqf is that the property is from the time of the British and the Hindus forcibly took illegal possession
 rajeev dhawan ne daleel di ki hamane 6 disambar 1992 ko dhaancha giraae jane ke baad apni maang badali or hamaari yahi maang he ki hamen 5 disambar 1992 kii sthiti main jis tarah kaa dhaancha tha usee sthiti main hamen masjid saunpi jaae
 There were many encroachments on behalf of Hindus
 is dauraan rajya sarkaar ki ore se muslimon ke adhikaar ki raksha kaa nirdesh bhi jari hua
 This makes it clear that the ownership belongs to the Muslims
 rajeev dhawan ne faijabad court ke adeshon ke bare main bataate hue kaha ki disambar 1949 kii ghatana ke baad antarim aadesh sirf states ko yani yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa tha, antarim aadesh ke tahat kisi ko malikana haq nahin diya ja saktaa
 Dhawan said - Why all the questions to us? Dhawan said that even after opening the lock, Hindus have not occupied it there
 hinduon ke paas sirf puja kaa adhikaar rahaa he
 On this, Justice Bobde asked, you are saying that Hindus used to go in and worshiped, but the question arises that this will not affect your authority? Dearsl, the court meant that if someone goes to your property, you will not mind the ownership? In the meantime Justice DY Chandrachud asked Rajiv Dhawan about the occupation of the outer enclosure of Hindus, Justice DY Chandrachud said That the documents from 1858 onwards show that Rama Chabutare was established, he had the authority

 The Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas was formed to demolish the mosque
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha hindu paksh ke paas is babat koi saboot nahin kii bhagwaan ram kaa janm aantarik ahaate main hua tha
 There is also no evidence that worship was done in the inner yard
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki elahabaad hai court ke faisle main justise khan or justise sharma kii raay ek duusare alag thi
 Justice Khan had said that no structure was demolished to build the mosque, whereas Justice Sharma had a different opinion
 dhawan ne kaha jilani ne sahi kaha tha ki 1885 se pehle ke kisi bhi dastavej ko nahin sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 The documents dating back to 1885 with the Hindu side are only books of foreign travelers and Skanda Purana and other books
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki masjid ko bhale hi dhwast kar diya gaya ho, lekin masjid hameshaa masjid hi rahati he
 The demolished or demolished building in Ayodhya is still a mosque
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki aurangzeb behad libral raja tha
 Did others, including Muhammad Ghori, who went to war in India build mosques? - Do not try to write a new type of history
 agar babar ke kaam kii samiksha hogi to ashok kii bhi kerani hogi
 Dhawan said - The Hindu side has very limited information, Rajiv Dhawan said that Islamic law is very complex? There is very limited information from the Hindu side about this

 is bich CJI ne muskuraate hue kaha rajeev dhawan ke paas aseem gyaan he
 Rajiv Dhawan said that there is no evidence from the Hindu side regarding the ownership
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki kya court sabhi un 500 masjidon kii khudaai karaayega, jisko lekar ye kaha jaataa he ki ye hindu mandir par bane he ? rajeev dhawan ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki agar masjid ke neeche kuch ansh kisi duusari dharm ke mili hai to bhi kya 450 saal puraani masjid avaidh ho jaaegi?supreme court ne jafar faruki ko muhaiyaa karai surakshasomvaar ko sunwaayee ke ant main CJI justise ranjan gogoi ne ek patr padhate hue kaha sunni vakf board upi ke chairman ne madhyasthata kamity ke sadsy shri ram panchu ko patr bheja, patr main jaan kaa khatra bataaya

 The PM said that Jhunjhunu does not know how to bow and knows how to cope with difficulties
 unhone kaha ki hamaare desh main nari ko puja jaataa he lekin aisa kya hua ki beti ko bachaane ke liye haath pair jodne pad rahe hai
 And governments have to draw a budget
 piem ne kaha ki aaj jab balak or balikaon ke janm dar main antar dikhataa he to kaaphi dukh hota he
 He said that now people have to decide that the more sons will be born, the more daughters will be born
 jitna betaa padhegaa to utani hi beti bhi padhegi
 We should start this from today itself
 unhone kaha ki agar ghar main saas kah de ki hamen beti chahie to kisi kii himmat nahin he ki beti ko paidaa hone se roak de
 Awareness has to be spread for the birth of daughters
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ke aane ke baad hamane haryana se beti bachaao beti padhaao ko launch kiya
 After which there has been a considerable improvement in the ratio of birth of daughters there
 aaj desh main betiyaan naam roshan kar rahi hai
 Those who believe that a son will work in old age, then it is wrong
 maine kai baar dekha he ki bete aaraam kii jindagi jite ho lekin maa-baap vriddhashram main rahete ho

 This anniversary of Nehru ji has come at a time when the country is neither in a position to celebrate Children's Day nor is celebrating Guru Parv with full devotion
 darasal kuch thilishahon or netaaon ko chhod den to puraa desh note badalane ke jugad main pareshaan he
 This trouble has been imposed on people in the name of black money
 khudpradhanmantri nebadi sahajata se kah diya ki mujhe 50 din de do
 But the wage laborer is unable to understand that his heart can sacrifice the country for 50 days, but how will the stomach of his child children be able to do this work? Science has not yet invented the medicine for hunger for 50 days
 is halaat mempandit nehruka march 1948 main sewagram main diya bhaashan bahut praasangik ho jaataa he
 Here, when leaders like Maulana Azad, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, Vinoba Bhave, Acharya Kripalani and Jai Prakash Narayan asked Nehru that Bapu had already left, who would lead him? So the words that Nehru has been battling in the country for two days of bread and clothes to cover his body are praise
 nehru ne saaf kaha ki badi-badi baaten mat haanko, main pradhanmantri hum to kuch bhi karke roti kapade kaa intjaam karuunga
 Stay entangled in the branch leaves, i will fix things from the root
 padhike bhaashan kaa ansh-mahaan purush alag baithkar seva kar sakate hai
 But they also have to associate themselves with the situation
 mahatmaji sawaalon ke saath khud ko baandh dete the
 She associated Khadi with independence, so she grew
 sirf aarthik drushti se vah itani na badhati
 She was safe in Mahatmaji
 ham bade sawaalon ko chhodkar khaadi vagairah ke bare main soch rahe hai
 Making different aviaries for themselves
 mahatmaji kii nigaah samooche desh par rahati thi
 He used to catch basic questions
 isliye ve noakhali gaye, kalkatte gaye, bihar gaye, dehali main aakar baith gaye
 Pyarelal Ji, i am fully agreed
 hamako kaam talashne kii jarurat nahin he
 Work is lying across the country
 ham dekhen ki buniyadi kaam kya he, mul kaam kya he
 Bapu's death shouts and says what is that work
 rachanaatmak kaam ke naam par ham apane khaane main kaam na karen
 The work done by Bapu in Delhi shows the importance of the question
 sampradayikta ke jehar kaa muqabla kiye bina ham apni aazaadee ko nahin bachaa sakate
 The government has a different way of solving questions
 uski apni maryaadaayen hoti hai
 Questions are not solved only by the power of the government
 main sarkaar main hum
 i live in Delhi
 raat din pehre main rahanaa padataa he
 Let out the soldiers in front, the soldiers in the back
 yah insaan kii jindagi nahin he
 I'm upset mujhe pinjade main rahanaa padataa he
 For me, this is a bigger prison than Ahmednagar and other prison houses
 asal kaid mere liye aaj he
 If this is the case then i will go crazy
 ise kab tak bardaasht kar sakuunga
 Some basic things were raised here in connection with Khadi Gramodyog etc
 is sawaal ko or sawaalon se alag rakhen
 There was talk of a competitive economy and a new social order
 dekhnaa yah he ki inke maani kya hai
 i understand another meaning from the competitive economy
 jo iconmi aap pesh kar rahe hai, vah apane bal par thahar sake
 If not today, after ten years, will it have the strength to stand on its legs or not
 sarkaar madad kare, aap use shuru karen
 But the basic thing is whether it has the power to stand on its own legs! There is a shortage of food
 agar ann kii kami ho ham puraa na kar sake to koi sarkaar logon ko bhukhe thode hi marane degi! jahaan tak uskaa bas chalegaa, vah baahar se ann laaegi
 There is a shortage of clothes
 ek vaikum taiyaar ho gaya he
 If we cannot fill it with Khadi, then no government will be able to talk about mill cloth without bringing foreign cloth
 vah logon ko nange nahin rahane de sakati
 If she does not try to overcome the shortage of clothes, the result will be dangerous
 agar apana kapadaa ham bana sakate hai to government madad bhale hi kare
 Close the mill lightly and close the outer cloth, will the vacuum fill automatically
 agar aaj videshi kapadaa yaa milon kaa kapadaa vaikum ko bhar dene laayak hota to vaikum hi na rahata
 But there is a vacuum, this means that we do not have the clothes we need
 yah baat desh ke liye khatre kii he
 Even after the arrival of foreign cloth and mills, Khadi cannot meet the shortage of cloth
 gramodyogon kii vastu government kii madad se kuch dinon ke baad apni taangon par khadi nahin rah sakati to vah nahin tehregi
 The thing is a bit complicated
 main nahin jaanata main use kahaan tak saaf kar sakaa hum
 What i mean is that removing the competitive economy does not solve the question
 duusari baat yuddh ke bare main he, yon to ham yuddh kisi se nahin karnaa chaahate
 But we will have to make complete arrangements for defense of the country
 aap kehete hai ki udyogon kii yojana desh-raksha kii drushti se na kii jaay
 i must claim that there is no industry which is not concerned with protecting the country
 kapade se bhi desh rakshan kaa sambandh aata he
 From the point of view of nation-protection, we will have to do industrialization to an extent
 cottage industies se iskaa muqabla nahin
 We have to create a framework of industrialization different from home industries
 audyogikaran se ek vayumandal hamane desh ko de diya he
 It has an impact on the rate of wages and on salaries
 lekin mujhe shaq nahin ki kitna hi audyogikaran kyon na ho, to bhi pachaasa yaa sau baras tak gramodyogon ko bahut zyada badhaane kii gunjaaish hogi
 The question is that in which things the village industry will be able to run and not in the matter
 aaj iskaa thik-thik jawaab mere paas nahin he
 The question of protecting the country is a question that changes the entire industrial environment
 bade bade udyog agar rajya ke kaabo main hon to ve non compatitive ho jate hai
 In which areas and where to grow domestic handicrafts, it is a question of study
 sarkaar kaa ferj he ki jin baton main gharelu dastakaariyaan chal sakati hai, vahaan unako puri tarah badhayen
 The fundamental problem of the world is that the whole world is moving towards centralization politically and economically
 ham bhi kendriya sarkaar ko adhik adhikaar dekar use majboot bananaa chaahate hai
 It is only in this matter that we get an idea to add the advantages of centralization and decentralization
 ham desh-rakshan ke sawaal ko chhod denge to apni rajnatik aazaadee bhi nahin rakh paaenge
 Then how can we maintain financial freedom
 yah sawaal sidhaa-saadhaa nahin he
 Is quite complicated
 bina kaate agar khaadi nahin chalati to yah sochna hoga ki vah chalegi yaa nahin
 There is a question of economic out-turn
 khud charkha chalaane kii baat duusare tarah kii he
 Charkha will be run by a select few, Babu Rajendra Prasad Chalveen, i can run, in this way many men should run
 ye chune hue aadmi ek lakh hon yaa das lakh hon
 They should solve the question of their clothes, but from the financial point of view they cannot solve the question of the production of clothes
 yah sawaal ek duusare kshetra se sambandh rakhata he
 So i requested that these questions have to be thought of again in the light of the new mood
 pichley maheene desh ke purvi praant punjab main aisi ghatnaon main kam se kam 15 log maare gaye or kai ghayal hue jinamein zyaadaatar majdoor the
 Soon people can get rid of mobile theft because those who make it disappear will be of no use
 sarkaar ek nai vyavastha laane kii taiyaari main he jo churaae gaye yaa gaayab hue mobile phone par sabhi sevaaon ko roak degi
 This system will work on all networks even after removing the SIM or changing the IMEI number
 saarvajanik kshetra kii bharat sanchaar nigam limited BSNL ko is nai pranali central ipement aaidentity register(ceir)ke liye saftware or kriyanvayan ke taur-tareeke ke vikaas kii jimmedaari di gayi thi or company ko apane pune centre se maharashtra main chah maheene tak iskaa payalat aadhaar par pareekshan karnaa he
 An official document states that CEIR aims to reduce the number of fake mobile phones and discourage theft
 isse graahakon ke hiton kii raksha hone ke saath kanoonee rup se aawaaj pakadaney (intercepshan) ko lekar jaanch agenciyon ke liye rasta sugam hoga
 The CEIR system will connect the IMEI database with all mobile operators as per dot's plan
 dastavej ke anusaar CEIR blike list main daale gayi mobile terminal (set) ko sabhi network operataron ke bich saajha karne ke liye ke liye kendriya pranali ke rup main kaam karata he taaki us category main ek network main rakhe gayi divaais duusare main kaam nahin karen
 This condition will also occur when the SIM card is replaced
 jab mobile phone gaayab hota he, sambandhit vyakti ko handset kaa pataa lagane ke liye IMEI sankhya bataanaa hoga
 IMEI is a 15-digit number that industry organization GSMA allocates
 dastavej main kaha gaya he, mobile phone kii chori keval vittiya nuksaan nahin he balki nagarikon ke vyaktigat jivan ke saath rashtriya suraksha ko bhi khatra he
 The IMEI of missing, stolen or fake handsets will be reported to CEIR
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ne vaise to doorsanchaar parichaalkon ko farji IMEI sankhya vaale mobile phone ko seva uplabdh karaane se manaa kiya he
 But companies have difficulty in identifying handsets with Konkali IMEI numbers
 CEIR parichaalkon ko farji IMEI sankhya vaale handset kii pahchaan main bhi madad karegaa
 The Department of Telecommunications is also set to notify regulations in which tampering IMEI number would be a punishable offense
 isamen teen saal tak kii jail ho sakati he

 a case of hostage raping has come to light in Shakarpur area of east Delhi
 ghatana us vakt jab peedita ghar ke paas hi dawaai lene gai thi
 At the same time, he got Naushad and made the victim sit in the car saying that he had to do something important
 car ko us vakt koi or shaksh chalaa rahaa tha
 The victim's family lived in Naushad four months ago on rent, due to which she moved with him
 naushaad peedita ko lekar ek anjaan makaan par gaya jahaan pehle se maujuud mahila ne use nashili cheez pilaa di
 The comments peedita ko jab hosh aayaa to uske badan se saare kapade utre hue the
 After this, the victim was forcibly held in that house for 12 days and the man raped her
 baad main aaropee ne peedita ko is shart par reeha kiya ki yahaan uske saath jo kuch hua vah kisi ko nahin bataaegi
 At the same time, the accused is denying the allegations leveled against him
 filhal police ne naushaad ko giraftaar kar liya he or us mahila kii talash sharu kar di he jisane nashil padaarth khilaayaa tha
 The incident happened when the victim went to take medicine near the house
 vahiin, usko naushaad mila or peedita ko yah kahkar car main baitha liya ki usko koi jaruri baat kerani he
 At that time someone else was driving the car
 peedita kaa parivaar chaar maheene pehle tak naushaad ke yahaan kiraye par rahata tha jisaki vajah se vah uske saath chali gai
 Naushad went with the victim to an unknown house where the woman already present gave him the intoxicating substance
 tippaniyan When the victim regained consciousness, all the clothes were removed from her body
 iske baad peedita ko us makaan main jabaran 12 dinon tak bandhak banaakar rakhaa gaya or uske saath vah shaks rape karata rahaa
 Later, the accused released the victim on the condition that she would not tell anyone what happened to her here
 vahiin, aaropee apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon se inkaar kar rahaa he
 Currently, Naushad is arrested by the police and has started a search for the woman who fed the intoxicating substance

 dilli sarkaar ne aam aadmi express bas seva shuru kii, lekin vipaksh ne isamen savaar hone se inkaar kar diya
 The Delhi government claims that this bus service will be beneficial for those who want to reach early and will take them to their destination without stopping
 lekin bijepi or congress donon ne hi na sirf is aam aadmi bypass express bas ko laal jhandi dikhaa di he, balki is bas seva ke naam par logon se dhokhaa karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 According to Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken, this bus service is a sign of the failure of the Kejriwal government, because when the Congress left power in Delhi, the DTC fleet had five and a half thousand buses, but now a year and a half later, the DTC has four thousand There are buses which provide people for travel
 sarkaar ne basen badhaane ke bajaae kam kar deen yaheen nahin rozaana lagbhag ek hazaar bas kisi na kisi kharabi kaa shikaar hokarmusafironse dur ho jaati hai, aise main aam aadmi bas seva ke naam par niyamit root kii bason ko or kam kar diya gaya he
 According to Maken, the Delhi government is running buses under different names only for the sake of political benefits, while a new bus government has not been able to buy and people are suffering due to this
 bijepi ne bhi aam aadmi bypass express kii shuruyaat par kejariwal sarkaar ko gherne main der nahin kii
 BJP National Minister RP Singh took a jibe and said that by running the Aam Aadmi Bypass Express, the Kejriwal government bypassed the promises that were made to the public before the election
 salanaa bajet yun to sarkaar kii aarthik kavayad hoti he or usamen vishesh samoohon ko khush karne kii raajnneeti bhi hoti he
 Hence on 28 February p
 chidambaram ke bajet pesh karne ke chand ghanton ke andar jab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bajet kaa swaagat kiya to raajnneeti par najar rakhane waalon ke kaan khadey ho gaye
 It is not often that a Chief Minister of the main opposition coalition NDA and the leader of the second largest ally party should praise the Union Budget
 haalanki nitish kumaar kii bajet kii prashansa bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene ke liye jataae gaye sanketon ke sandarbh main he lekin ise endie kii andruni raajnneeti se katkar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Currently, the question is that if BJP projects Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, will Nitish leave NDA? This Yaksha question is in front of the country, which cannot be answered with certainty at the moment
 lekin rajnatik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki jahaan endie ke netaaon main pradhanmantri pad ke liye modi kaa samarthan karne kii hode machi he, vahiin jediu ke nitish kumaar gathbandhan chhodie kii sambhaavnaaon par vichaar kar sakate hai
 Changing the ground for the Chief Minister of Bihar may be politically damaging, but leaving the benefits of an alliance with the BJP in Bihar does not seem favorable
 modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main kabool karne kii sthiti main nitish ke saamne muslim voton ko khone kaa khatra ho jayega
 Muslims constitute about 16 percent of Bihar's total electorate
 nitish kheme ko dar he ki narendra modi agar endie ke netaa ke taur par saamne aate hai to ve phir se bihar main sarkaar banane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge, kyonki ve badi mushkil se muslim matadaataaon kaa lalu prasad yadav ke rashtriya janata dal (argedy) se mohabhang kar paae hai
 Nitish has achieved this success by forcing BJP to take welfare measures for Muslims and keep Narendra Modi away from campaigning in the state since the November 2005 ruling
 modi ke mudde par bijepi se naata todakar nitish musalmaan matadaataaon ke bich nayak to ban sakate hai, lekin ve sambhavat: bijepi samarthak ucch jati ke 12 fisadi vot bank se vanchit rah jaaen
 It is also a fact that when Nitish and BJP contested separate assembly elections in 1995, both of the 324 assembly seats of undivided Bihar could get only 48 seats
 nitish kii mushkil yah he ki ve modi ke naam par samjhauta kar lete hai to lalu ko apana yadav-musalmaan (emwai) janaadhar phir se hasil karne kaa mauka mil jayega
 However, Nitish's alliance with the BJP has been beneficial
 nitish ko pataa he ki bijepi-jediu gathbandhan tuutane se nae saamaajik-rajnatik sameekaran ubhar sakate hai
 In 2010, the rjd-lok Janshakti Party coalition got 29 percent of the votes, compared to 39 percent votes received by the NDA
 nitish ne saavdhaanee baratate hue abhi tak modi kii bajaae kisi 'dharmanirpeksh’ ummidavaar ko namit kiye jane ke liye endie ke saamne koi samay seemaa nahin nirdhaarit kii he
 But the February 18 statement of BJP President Rajnath Singh, who described Modi as the 'most popular leader' and suitable for 'an important role' in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, pointed to the party's strategy
 lekin nitish tab tak kisi faisle ke mood main nahin dikhte hai, jab tak bijepi faisla nahin kar leti
 Nitish recently said, "there is no doubt in our party on this issue
 magar gathbandhan ke netritv kaa masalaa endie kii baithak main hi tay kiya jayega
 "his willingness not to offend the minority voters was also shown by the readiness with which he amended the circular mandating Surya Namaskar for school children on 16 February
 matlab saaf he-nitish endie ke liye apni raajnneeti qurbaan nahin karenge

 yogi ne samaajwaad ko bhi 'dhokhaa' or 'mrigatrushna' bataate hue use fasiwad or najeevaad se joda tha
 After this, the SP chief Akhilesh had said in a 'tweet' on it that the word 'socialist' is recorded in the Preamble of the Constitution as the basic spirit of the Constitution
 mukhyamantri kaa samaajwaad ko 'jhootha, samaapt or dhokhaa' kahana samvidhan kii avmaananaa kaa gambhir mudda he, iske liye unhen desh se maafee maangani chaahi' or ek sachche yogi kii tarah pad tyaag dena chahie

 But the 81-year-old retired IAS officer of Rajasthan believes that justice should not leave the struggle, delayed
 inhone 47 saal kii lambii ladaai ke baad 81 saal kii umr main rajasthan vishwavidhalay se gold medal jeeta he
 In 2003, 'aaj Tak' showed how this IAS officer had won the gold medal battle from the High Court, but the university took 13 years to award this gold medal
 duniya keval first ko yaad rakhti he baaki sab bheed kaa hissaa he
 At the age of 81, younger than 64-year-old Rajasthan University vice-chancellor JP Singhal, who took a gold medal and degree, retired IAS officer Ajit Singh Singhvi had been in tune since 1969 that i did not approve anything other than the gold medal
 aaj se 47 saal pehle 1969 main elelbi main inhone pariksha di magar rajasthan vishvidhalay ne inhen mereet main duusare sthaan par chunaa
 He filed a petition in the Munsif court against the decision of how to give the number
 is bich apni padhai jari rakhi or 1979 main aies bhi ban gaye
 Ajit Singh may have become a collector but did not stop appearing in court
 ab tak 300 peshiyon par upasthit hokar khud pairvi karne vaale singhvi munshif court se jite to mukadmaa district court main gaya, phir vahaan se bhi jite to mukadmaa hoicourt main gaya
 In 2003, the High Court ordered Rajasthan University to give gold medal to Ajit Singhvi, but it took 13 years and finally his efforts paid off
 gale main gold medal latakaae or haath main degree liye ajit singhvi kehete hai ki mujhe khushi to he ki mujhe 47 saal baad aakhirkaar meraa haq mil gaya lekin dukh kii baat he ki mujhe apni mehnat kaa fal paane main 300 peshiyon par aana padaa
 He told that he used to come to Jaipur as a Bikaner Collector and advocate his case
 agar us vakt ye gold medal mila hota to unke duungarpur college ke liye shaan kii baat hoti
 It took 13 years after the decision of the High Court to get the medal, in 2003 with 'aaj Tak', he reached the VC office of Rajasthan University where the VC on camera said that very soon he will be given the gold medal
 magar 13 saal kaa vakt lag gaya
 Vice Chancellor of Rajasthan University JP Singhal says that he is happy that Voices could give the elderly Kogold medal but there is also the grief of the delay
 rajasthan vishvavidhyalay ke vakil ashok maaru kaa kahana he ki us vakt jo mukademe main party the unhen khojane main 12 saal kaa vakt lag gaya, us samay ke topper ke alaava bhi chaar-paanch log is maamle main party the jinka koi pataa hin nahi mil rahaa tha
 Therefore, the execution of the judgment took 12 years and the formalities were delayed by 8 months

 CBSE officials are cautious and are working towards making the examination go smoothly

 Cultivation techniques are changing all over the world
 jutai, buaai, khaad tathaa kitnashkon ke prayog, fasal kataai, bhandaaran ke kshetra main ab aisi takanic aa gai he, jisase kisaan kaa shram or samay donon bache hai or paidaavaar bhi badi he
 Farming is also changing in India but on a small scale it is limited to a few areas, a few individuals
 desh kaa bahutayat kisaan aaj bhi premchand kaa ''hori " bana hua he
 Even after being an agrarian country, the priorities of our governments have been towards short-term options such as subsidies and loans, while we need to develop agro-technology to suit our circumstances
 hamaare kisaanon ke paas jameen simit he or unhen bahut badi jansankhya ke liye anaaj ugaana padataa he
 Countries like America are leading in agricultural technology because farmers have thousands of acres of land there
 bhartiya paristhiti kii tulana to korea, japan or taiwan jaise deshon se hi ho sakati he
 But due to advanced technology, these countries are able to get full yield even from small holdings
 ye desh nirantar fasal kii naveenatam kismein viksit karte rahete hai jabaki ham abhi duusari harith kranti kii pratiksha main hai
 As a result of the Green Revolution, the yield in the country grappling with the shortage of grains was 1 in 1967-68
 65 karod ton ho gai
 Sowing 1 till 1971-72
 91 karod hectare tak hone lagi or paidaavaar 2
 Reached 64 million tonnes
 is baari uplabdhi ke baad bhi harith kranti kii kuch aalochanaayen hoti rahi hai
 The Green Revolution was limited mainly to certain crops like wheat, jowar, millet
 bhartiya prayadweep ke mukhya bhojan chaaval main bhi iskaa koi vishesh laabh nahin dekha gaya
 The Green Revolution was also not a nationwide success and remained confined to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu only
 harith kranti kii iske liye bhi katu aalochana hoti he ki isse poonjivadi krishi ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 The argument is that without proper capital, no farmer can plant high yielding seeds in his fields
 khaad, sinchai, krishi yantron par bhi bahut vyay karnaa padataa he jo chote yaa majhole kisaan kii kuwwat main nahin he
 There is also no doubt that due to the agricultural implements used in the Green Revolution, the rural population is now migrating to cities in search of employment
 yah vichaarneey tathy he ki kya harith kranti ke vartmaan swaroop se laabh unheen kisaanon ko ho rahaa he, jinke paas nijee pumping set, tractor, nalakup vagairah hai?haalanki harith kranti ke naate hi bharat aaj sava sau karod se adhik jansankhya kaa bharan-poshan karne main sakasham he
 Even today, we have not come much ahead of that success
 jaev takneekee tathaa aanvik str par bahut se shodh kaary jari hai lekin ab tak ke sabhi prayaas oont ke munh main jira jaise rahe hai
 The suicide of farmers is a bitter reality of our century
 barsaat tathaa bhoojal par nirbhar kheti or chote-chote talabon kaa nirmaan keval simit parinaam de saktaa he
 We have to increase the irrigated area
 chote or majhole aakaar ke baandhon kaa nirmaan karne, nahar-network banane or cmand kshetron kaa vikaas karne kii jarurat he
 The biggest drawback of our agricultural education system is that it does not connect with its foundation
 agriculture collejon se padhakar nikle zyaadaatar vidhyaarthee kheti se jude nahin pate
 Critical evaluation of agricultural education institutions is needed
 hamen samajhnaa hoga ki harith kranti unnat beej, takanic or sinchai ke liye kiye gaye prayaason se safal hui thi
 The same factors can form the basis of new revolution even today

 Preparations have been completed to hand over the command of the camp to the son of Ram Rahim, bypassing Honeypreet
 bas, mangalvaar shaam ko isi silsile main dere main honevaali ek sikret meeting main is par aakiri muhar lagani baaki he
 Actually, Ram Rahim's family wants to hunt two with one stone by handing over the throne to Jasmeet
 ek to is tarah wo haniprit kaa dabadabaa kam karne main kaamyaab honge or doosraa jasmit ke deraa pramukh banane se karodon kii daulat kii chaabi unke parivaar ke paas hi rahegi
 In this way, the dreams of Honeypreet's dreams of taking possession of the camp and living the rest of the life gracefully are now scattered
 mangalvaar kii shaam is par muhar lag jaaegi
 Ram Rahim's family will leave Honeypreet and decide to crown Ram Rahim's son Jasmeet Insa
 isi masale par dere ke andar shahi parivaar kii kothi main ek sikret meeting rakhi gai he
 Secret, because at present, the police has banned the camp management from organizing any gathering
 aise main gupachup meeting ke sivaay deraa prashasan ke paas koi chaara hi nahin he
 The people of the camp are in a hurry to do so for two reasons
 awwal to wo isi bahaane haniprit ko kinare laga sakate hai, jo ab tak naa sirf ram rahim ke dil par raaj karti thi, balki uske dil ke raste par bhi raaj karne lagi thi
 The condition had even arisen that she did not consider herself to be the family members of Ram Rahim
 doosraa ye ki ram rahim or haniprit ke jail jane ke baad dere ke skool or college ke sivaay takreeban saare ke saare kaarobaar yaa to thapp pade hai yaa phir unki raftaar tham gai he
 These include the business of more than 20 dera factories
 aise main dere kii kamai par bhi asar padaa he
 In such a situation, unless someone is officially entrusted with the task of holding the helm of the camp, the shadow of the camp is not clouded
 lihaaza, ram rahim kaa parivaar gupachup tareeqe se hi sahi, dere ke khaas logon ke saath baithkar is par aakiri faisalaa lenaa chahta he
 Anyway, who has taken up the task of handing over the command of the dera to Jasmeet, no one currently has equal status in the dera
 kyonki wo koi or nahin balki ram rahim kii maa naseeb cor he
 Who can cut their way when their mother is on a mission? naseeb cor ne apane pote ko dere kaa pramukh maan liya he
 He has also taken the consent of his son Ram Rahim in jail
 aise main mangalvaar kii sikret meeting kii aupchaarikta ke baad jasmit ko aagaamee 25 november ko ram rahim ke guru shah satnam kii jayanti ke maukey par adhikarik rup se dere kii kaman saunpi ja sakati he
 This verdict is nothing short of a big shock for Honeypreet

 Union Minister Singh told news agency ANI, 'west Bengal is the only state in the country where democracy has no place
 bengal main mamata banerjee uttari korian netaa kim jong-un kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 Like her, she kills every person who raises her voice against her
 'kalakatta hoicourt ke rathyatra par roak lagane vaale aadesh ke khilaaf bhaajapa ne somvaar ko supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 After this petition, Union Minister Singh made this remark, targeting Mamata Banerjee
 kendriya mantri singh ne saath hi kaha ki loktantr main desh ke kisi hisse main bhi koi raily yojit kar saktaa he
 He said, 'no one can stop us
 ham supreme court main cese jeetenge
 'let me tell you, the Bharatiya Janata Party approached the Supreme Court on Monday to carry out its rath yatra in West Bengal
 party ne kalakatta hai court kii khandpeeth ke us aadesh ko chunauti di he, jisane rathyatra nikaalane kii anumati dene vaale ekal nyaayadhish ke aadesh ko radd kar diya tha
 The saffron party's ambitious roadshow in West Bengal suffered a setback on Friday when a bench of the Calcutta High Court quashed the decision of a single bench allowing the roadshow
 iske baad pashchim bengal bhaajapa ikai ke adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne kaha tha, ‘hamane supreme court jane kaa nirnay kiya he
 We have full faith in the judiciary and we will fight till the end
 trinmul congress sarkaar yah sunishchit karnaa chaahati he ki hamaari rath yatra nahin ho paae
 According to BJP sources, the party will presently hold rallies in many parts of the state against the government's decision not to allow the yatra
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa kii apil par sunwaayee ke baad guuruuvaar ko hoicourt kii ekal peeth ne rath yatra kii ijaajat de di thi lekin shuukravaar ke aadesh ke baad is kaarykram par ek baar phir sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 Canada and Kenya will compete in the ICC World Cup-2011 on Monday at the Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium
 group-e kii in donon tiimon ko ab tak jeet kii talash he
 The result of this match will not make any difference in the group-a table, as the other teams have already opened the account
 is lihaaj se yah muqabla is group kii duusari tiimon ke liye nunatam mahatv vaala lekin khilne vaali tiimon ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hoga
 Important not only because it will give the winning team a chance to move up the table, but also because the chances of vicissitudes will give it the morale to perform its best in the next two matches
 kenya or canada ne ab tak teen-teen match khele hai
 Both teams have suffered heavy losses in all three
 is group main srilanka,australia,pakistan or newjiland jaisi majboot tiimon ke alaava ek anya kamjor team zimbabwe bhi he,lekin vah apana khaataa khol chukaa he
 Kenya suffered a crushing defeat by New Zealand by 10 wickets in their first match
 is haar ne uske khilaadiyon kaa manobal is kadar giraaya ki vah agle match main pakistan se 205 ranon se pit gaya
 After this, Sri Lanka was completed by the right amount, which defeated them by nine wickets
 canada ne haalanki apane pehle do match buree tarah ganvaane ke baad tisare match main sangharsh kiya lekin anubhav kii kami ke kaaran vah haar gaya
 He was defeated by Sri Lanka by 210 runs in his first match
 iske baad zimbabwe ne use 175 ranon se haraakar apana khaataa kholaa
 He struggled a little against Pakistan but eventually gave him a knee in front of Shahid Afridi
 is match main use 46 ranon se haar mili
 Looking at Canada's performance against Pakistan, it can be said that this team has possibilities, but there is a huge lack of experience
 yahi baat kenya ke saath bhi he
 Although he has more experienced players than Canada, but in terms of struggle, he can be called inferior to Canada
 is akalan kaa yah arth nikaala ja saktaa he ki kenya ke khilaaf canada kaa palada thodaa baari he lekin iske baavjood jeet ke liye use apana shreshth pradarshan karnaa hoga
 His bowling was good against Pakistan but the batsmen were disappointed
 kenya kii team apane teenon muqablon main ballebaaji vibhaag main buree tarah naakaam rahi thi
 Given the strength of the batsmen of the teams playing in the three matches he has had to play, it would not be appropriate to say whether his bowlers have done justice to his talent so far, but it can be said that Kenya's pass in the match is a good chance to open the account by defeating Canada
 timen is prakaar hai : kenya : jimmy kamande, tanmay mishra, james nagoche, shem nagoche, elex obanda, colins obayua, david obayua, nehemia odhiyambo, thomas odoyo, peter ongondo, elizah otiano, mauris oma, rakep patel, steve tikolo or seren waters

 In the hands that had to have pens or toys, it is so much work that even after working 18 hours out of 24 hours, it is not finished
 dilli se sate gudgaanv main pichley saal hui barish ke baad hero honda chowk par pani bharne ke kaaran 14 ghante kaa mahajam laga tha, is ghatana ke baad haryana sarkaar kii jamkar aalochana hui thi
 Due to such a jam, the Haryana government inaugurated the Hero Handa Chowk flyover being built for the past several years

 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apana pad chhodane par ade hai
 They do not want to retract their decision under any circumstances
 aise main congress ke puraane diggaj netaa agle kadam par gahan chintan kar rahe hai
 There are reports quoting sources that Rahul has made up his mind and he is not going to consider the repeated requests coming to him
 congress ko haal hi main sampann hue loksabhaa chunaav main baari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The party managed to win only 52 seats, while the BJP under Narendra Modi has won more than 300 seats
 wo 4 kaaran jis par rahul istife par ade1-congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa maananaa he ki party ke varisht netaaon ne tikat vitaran main parivaar ko tarjeeh di jabaki unhen isse bachanaa chahie tha
 According to sources, the old leaders of Rahul Gandhi Party, Ashok Gehlot, Kamal Nath and P
K
 chidambaram se kaaphi khafa hai, jinhone haal hi main hue loksabhaa chunaav main apane beton ko jeet dilaane kii koshish kii or party ke liye kaam nahin karte dikhe
 However, it is now believed that Rahul has accepted that he will lead the Congress party in the Lok Sabha, where the party has won 52 seats this time, which is only 8 more than the previous seats
 unki maa sonia gandhi upie kii adhyaksh bani rahengi or gandhi parivaar khud ko party ke rojaanaa kii gatividhiyon se dur rakhega
 2- In the recent elections, the Congress could not even open its account in 16 states, two union territories
 yahaan tak kii aath purv mukhyamantri or loksabhaa main party ke netaa bhi apana chunaav haar gaye
 The Congress fielded 421 candidates across the country but only 52 of them could win
 yah lagaataar duusari baar he, jab party ne itnaa kharaab pradarshan kiya he
 Among the leaders who lost the election are four leaders in the Congress Working Committee, which is the party's decision-making body
 3-congress ke andar bhale koi khul kar na bole lekin andruni taur par rahul gandhi ke netritv or haalia chunaav main unke prachaar abhiyaan ke taur tareekon par netaaon ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 These leaders feel that Rahul Gandhi was given a chance in two general elections but the party is not able to perform satisfactorily
 is baar kaa chunaav congress ke liye karo yaa maro vaala tha
 The atmosphere also appeared to be in favor of the Congress this time, but the results were inverted
 iske liye teen mudde ahm bataae ja rahe hai jin par rahul gandhi bahut acha nahin kar paae
 First Hindutva, second triple divorce and third justice scheme
 hindutv par party mukhar na ho saki, teen talaak par virodh kiya gaya or nyaay yojana chunaav ke antim kshanon main project kiya gaya
 Therefore, the party was left behind even after tireless efforts
 4-rahul gandhi pradeshon main congress kheme ko ekajute karne kii bharsak koshish karte rahe hai lekin pradesh str ke adhyakshon or vahaan ke netaaon main foot jagajaahir he
 a living example of this was seen in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi
 rajasthan main gahalot banaam sachin payalat, madhya pradesh main kamalnath banaam digvijay singh, haryana main bhupender singh hooda banaam ashok tanvar or dilli main shila dikshit banaam ajay maakan ke aapasi matbhed saamne hai
 Despite wanting lakhs, Rahul Gandhi could not cut it
 wo 4 kaaran jis par congressi manaane par ade1-congress kii haar bhale hui ho lekin iske netaa maanate hai ki nehru-gandhi parivaar kii sabase badi khaasiyat party ko ekasutra main pirone kii rahi he
 The leaders of the states place the head of the High Command on their eyes and according to the instructions passed from Delhi, further work is done
 chunaav jeetne ke liye party kya kuch kar sakati he, nehru-gandhi parivaar ke adhyaksh isaki ranneeti bakhubi banaate rahe hai
 Sonia Gandhi kept the party tied during her presidency and the government became a coalition, she played a central role in it
 rahul gandhi isamen chook gaye lekin ab ve iske 'course karection' main jarur lage hai
 2-one or two decades ago, apart from the nehru-gandhi family, the Congress was headed by Jagjivan Ram, K
 kamraj, narsimha raav or seetaram kesari ke haathon main rahi
 The leaders of today's generation see the performance of the work of these presidents and the work of the presidents of the nehru-gandhi family, so they have more faith in the work of Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 in netaaon kaa maananaa he ki nehru-gandhi parivaar ke alaava koi or adhyaksh banataa he to party ke andar kalah or gutbaji zyada hoti he jiskaa asar kaamkaaj par padataa he
 To avoid this, Congress leaders see the bright future of the party in Rahul Gandhi
 3-rashtriya str par dekhen to rahul gandhi jaisi apil kisi or netaa kii nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi's specialty is that where there is to increase the harmony with satraps, they do not hesitate in this and where the self-respect of the party is to be kept ahead, they do not retreat even in that
 tamilnadu main unki yah ranneeti kaam ai or unhone bijepi or ediemke gathbandhan kaa supada saaf kara diya
 In Delhi, he put forward the self-respect of the Congress and denied the alliance considering the Aam Aadmi Party as a fierce opponent
 congress yahaan bhale na jeet pai ho lekin duusare number par jarur rahi or aam aadmi party ke vot share main send laga diya
 4- When it comes to functional autonomy, everyone's eyes are fixed on the nehru-gandhi family
 rahul gandhi ke alaava agar kisi or netaa ko adhyaksh banaaya jaae to satta kaa vikendrikaran hoga, alag alag power centre banenge
 This will increase political wrangling and deepen the leadership crisis in the party
 congress netaa isi takaraav kii raajnneeti se bachanaa chaahate hai or rahul gandhi ko adhyaksh pad par bane dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Now it is to be seen whether Rahul Gandhi succeeds in his plan or wants to see his well-wisher leader Rahul Gandhi in the party
 congress kii bagdor nehru-gandhi parivaar se itar kisi ke haath jaaegi yaa rahul gandhi hi sanbhaalenge, is par sabaki nigahen tiki hai

 After the controversy, the UP BJP has removed the word 'love jihad' from its official agenda in the state executive meeting
 haalanki agenda se shabd hat gaya he lekin iskaa alag tareeke se zikr kiya gaya he
 When the party passed the resolution on the second day of the meeting, it has been written that the misconduct of women belonging to a particular class in the state and the involvement of a certain class of people in it is a coincidence or plan, it is a matter of concern
 yani kahin na kahin ishaara lav jehad kii hi ore he
 Let me tell you that a press note was issued about this meeting on Friday, then there was a reference to Love Jihad in it
 lekin shanivaar ko jab rajya kaaryakarini kii baithak shuru hui to party ke netaa anya muddon par to bole lekin lav jehad par chuppi sadhi rahi
 Now when the resolution has been passed, the term is not used
 haalanki duusare tareeke se hi iskra zikr kar diya gaya he
 It is clear that the party will make it a political issue in the coming assembly elections

 After this, the court was presented a favor on behalf of ASI
 ASI kii report par sawaal uthaane vaali daleel ab pehali apil main sunne se samvidhan peeth ne saaf inkaar kar diya
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that the objections you are raising here regarding the ASI report, you did not say these things during the trial

 Hearing arguments for 2019: 03
 20 pm:sunwaayee ke dauraan justise bobade ne kaha ki kya aapane, court kamishnar or ASI visheshgy ne court ke aadesh par koi report saunpi
 So do you want to say that someone else prepared the report? There is no inquiry from the court commissioner anyway
 is par minakshi aroda ne kaha ki hamaari aapatti ye he ki bina saboot ke report kaa kya matlab he? isapar justise chandrachud ne kaha ki wo court kamishnar he naa ki aapkaa gavaah
 Meenakshi Arora replied that we had objected because we wanted to discuss the summary of their report but the court did not allow us

 02
 50 PM:ASI kii ore se minakshi aroda ne kaha ki hoicourt ne bhi is maamle main kuch nahin kaha ki masjid babar ne banaai yaa aurangzeb ne, main bhi isamen nahin paduungin
 On this, Justice Chandrachud said that what is the basis of ASI not accepting the report? Justice Bobde said that there is also a tradition of renovation of temples, old old temples are rebuilt at the same place
 kya jeern mandir kii jagah par masjid banaai gai?isapar minakshi aroda ne kaha ki ye to hindu paksh ko bataanaa padegaa ki vahaan mandir tha, wo saboot den
 How will it be proved from a traveller's account that someone told him that there was a temple there
 12
 14 PM: Meenakshi Arora, on behalf of ASI in the Supreme Court cited the High Court verdict, saying that in 1885 the District Judge had found that Mahant Raghubar Das had built the temple
 masjid aisi jagah banaai gai, jo hinduon ke liye pavitra thi, isko 356 saal ho gaye hai
 In such a case, doing something in this matter will disturb the peace, so both sides maintain the status quo
 12
 11 PM: After the arguments of the Muslim side are over, arguments are being presented by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the Supreme Court
 ASI kii ore se minakshi aroda adaalat main daleelein pesh kar rahi hai

 kuch logon kaa vishwaas he ki vahaan ramajnmasthan tha lekin tab 1528 main kuch hua tha
 12
 05 pm:muslim paksh kii ore se jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki 1865 main pehali baar nihang sikh masjid vaali imaarat main jabaran ghuse or paath shuru kiya tha

 mandiron ke is shahar main saare mandir hinduon ke nahin the
 During this time, Jilani cited a report of 1862 describing the birthplace as a separate temple
 report main kaha gaya he ki ramkot bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan he
 To this, Justice Bobde said that his gazetteer states that Ramchabutara is the birthplace of Rama and is 40 to 50 feet away from the central dome
 jilani ne jawaab diya ki ye unka vishwaas he hamaara nahin he
 At the same time, Justice Bhushan said that the British had divided the place into two parts, an inner and outer courtyard i
e
 the coatyard, so they started worshiping in the outer coatyard
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki sabhi gajetir is baat kaa ishaara karte hai ki ram chabutare par hi bhagwaan ram kaa janm hua tha
 10
 55 am:muslim paksh kii ore se jafarayab jilani ne supreme court main kaha ki vah ramchabutare ko bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan nahin maanate hai

 gauratlab he ki rajeev dhawan kaa kahana he ki bhagwaan ram kaa janm ayodhya main hua tha, lekin kahaan iskaa jawaab unke paas nahin he
 What was said on Tuesday? Tell you that during the hearing on Tuesday, the Muslim side in the Supreme Court had admitted that Ramchabutra is the birthplace of Ram
 supreme court main ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par 30wein (24 sitambar) din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh ne mana ki ram chabutara hi janmasthan he kyonki hindu daavedaar bhi saalon se isi par vishwaas karte rahe hai
 The Muslim side said that in this case, in 1885, the District Judge ordered that Hindus considered Ram Chabootare as a Jansthan
