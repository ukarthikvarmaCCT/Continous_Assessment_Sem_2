 ’ Is the world going to end in a few hours from now
 21 may ko kaaymat kaa din bataaya ja rahaa he
 An American evangelist has claimed that according to American time, the apocalypse is coming at 6 pm on May 21
 yani dharm prachaarak kii maane to sirf 8 ghante kii mohalat he insaani sabhyataa ke liye
 After this claim, a big debate on doom has started all over the world because this is the question of the lives of 6 billion people around the world
 america se uthi ek afvaah ne lakhon logon ke jehan main dar bitha diya he duniya ke khatme kaa
 Rumor has it that the end of the world is about to begin in the next few hours
 aaj kii taarikh ko naam diya gaya he jajment de yani nyaay kaa din
 The day when Jesus Christ will descend to earth and begin the apocalypse of the world
 hairaani he ki is afvaah kii shuruyaat duniya ke sabase viksit desh america se hui he or is par bharosa karne vaale bhi sabase zyada usee desh main hai
 An American evangelist, Harold Camping, has predicted that according to American time, the end of the world will begin at 6 pm on May 21, and for the next five months, the whole world will suffer disasters like earthquakes, sometimes earthquakes
 ye paanch mahine insaan kii jindagi ke sabase mushkil pal honge
 In these five months the entire human civilization will end
 family radio chalaane vaale camping ne baqayada jajment de ke naam se puri duniya main posters or hordings lagava kar apni bhavishyavaanee kaa elaan kiya
 Internet was also used extensively to spread rumors
 logon main dar bithaane ke liye internet par baqayada khatmen kii shuruyaat ke lakshan bhi bataae gaye hai
 The extent is that the natural disasters that have come up all over the world have also been linked to the symptoms of the end of the world
 logon ko apni bhavishyavaanee main yakeen dilaane ke liye camping ne bible par research kaa hawala diya he
 Camping claims that after researching the Bible for 70 years, he understood the date of the end of the world
 camping ke daawey main yakeen karne waalon kii taadaat bhi lakhon main he
 These people have taken to the streets for the last few days
 baqayada jajmend de ke posters or tisharts pahan kar is afvaah ko hawa de rahe hai
 In his mind, he has thought that he is making people aware of the impending disaster by doing such propaganda
 inhen koshishon kaa nateeja he ki 21 may kii taarikh duniya ke kai deshon main dehshat kii taarikh ban gai he
 If we believe in camping, in the next few hours Jesus Christ will come back to earth and only then will the destruction begin
 duniya ke do fisadi achche logon ko jisas turant swarg bhej denge
 These would be the people who never did any bad thing
 baaki aabaadi dharti par hi agle 153 dinon tak har rose maut ke khauf kaa saamana karti rahegi
 According to the theory of camping, the destruction of Leela, which started on May 21, will erase the human face from the earth by October 21
 camping ko bhi maaloom hai ki unke daawey bade hai, apane daavon ko sachcha sabit karne ke liye unhone kai nai theoriyaan gadhi hai lekin vaigyanik, bhugarbha shastri or duusare dharm guru unki in theoriyon par yakeen karne ko taiyaar nahin
 This theory of camping is being considered as just another way to scare people

 nausena aviation ke liye shuukravaar ko 13 sitambar kii taarikh behad khaas rahi
 The first Tejas LCA (navy) controlled landing was done on INS Hansa, a seaside resort in Goa
 isse pehle aisa landing keval america, france, rus, britain or china ke navy ne hi kar paaya tha
 Now India's name has also been included in this episode
 is landing ke baad tejas ab bhartiya nausena vimanavahak, vikramaditya par udaan ke dauraan vimanavahak ke land kar paayegaa
 The importance of the mastery that Tejas has gained can be understood from the fact that a light fighter aircraft needs to land a one kilometer distance runway or takeoff, but the Navy's LCA take off only 200 meters on the runway And the landing has to be done on a 100-meter runway with the help of an ester wire
 raksha mantri rajnath singh ne is safalataa ke liye edie, echeel, diardio or nausena ko badhai di he
 Naval Aviation has always been considered more dangerous than the Air Force

 aapako bataa den ki donon ne apane bollywood kariyar kii shuruyaat 'ishkajade' se saath main hi kii thi
 The 80th day in 'bigg Boss' house started with Swami Om's drama, he roamed the house on a paper with 'BB viewers, forgive me and please vote me' and put that paper on his clothes
 iske baad 'big bos' ne malgadee task phir se shuru hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 Even before the buzzer of starting the task, Swami Om took food and sat in the goods train
 baithte hi unhone nitibha kii chadar chin lee, jab unhone chadar waapas maangi to kehane lage ki vah unki nahin 'big bos' kii he isliye vah waapas nahin karenge
 After some time, Swami Om snatched the umbrella of Nitibha and refused to give it
 isse gusse main aae manu ne chaataa waapas chhinane main nitibha kii madad kii
 In this snarl, Swami Om got hurt and started bleeding
 vah malgadee main hi apana khun chhidakane lage
 'bigg Boss' summons him to the confession room where he starts crying crying that Manu and Nitibha have committed hooliganism with him and he should be evicted from the house
 lekin 'big bos' ne unhen fatkaar lagaai ki unhone task ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya or task se baahar hone ke baad bhi malgadee main chadh gaye
 The comments antat: task dobaaraa shuru hua or rohan or mona ne manavir, manu or nitibha ko baari-baari se jail se reeha kar 'big bos' ko saunp diya
 After this, the task was announced and asked Mona to tell the householders how much he and Rohan had charged
 iske baad unhone ghoshnaa kii ki is task ke jariye gharavaalon ne prise mani 43, 99, 206 rupee badha lee he
 He also announced that Bani and Swami Om are contenders for captaincy
 iske baad manu, manavir, lopa or anya gharavaale swami om kaa majaak udaane lage ki unki keemat keval 444 rupee he
 Later, Lopa was seen telling Rohan that Bani had no contribution in raising the prize money, so she would not give him a week's immunity by making him captain
 vahiin rohan ne kaha ki vah swami om ko ghar ke captain ke rup main nahin dekh sakate
 Therefore, he will support Bani only
 iske kuch der baad hi 'big bos' ne ek or task gharavaalon ko diya
 He had to take a selfie in different parts of the house in due time, for this task, Swami Om was made director and Manveer was made assistant director
 task shuru hote hi swami om ne dikalair kar diya ki vah har selfi kaa hissaa rahenge
 manu-manveer also fought with them in an attempt to stop them
 der raat swami om ne nitibha, manavir or manu ke saamne ghar kaa captain banane kii ichha jaahir kii or unase apane liye vot bhi maanga
 However, Manveer said that he does not deserve to be the captain
 task shuru karne kaa bajer bajane se pehle hi swami om khaanaa lekar malgadee main baith gaye
 As soon as he sat down, he snatched the sheet of Nitibha, when he asked for the sheet back, he said that he was not 'bigg Boss' so he would not return
 kuch der baad hi swami om ne nitibha kii chhatari chin lee or dene se inkaar karne lage
 Angered by this, Manu helped Nitibha snatch the umbrella back
 is chhina-jhapati main swami om ko chot lag gai or khun bahane laga
 He started spraying his blood in the goods train itself
 'big bos' ne unhen kanpation room main bulaayaa jahaan vah rote hue shikaayat karne lage ki manu or nitibha ne unke saath gundgardee kii he or unhen ghar se nikaala janaa chahie
 But 'bigg Boss' reprimanded him that he violated the rules of the task and climbed into the goods train even after being out of the task

 baad main lopa rohan se yah kahati dikhin ki prise mani badhaane main bani kaa koi yogadan nahin rahaa he isliye unhen captain banaakar vah unhen ek saptaah kii immunity nahin dengi
 Rohan said that he cannot see Swami Om as the captain of the house

 lekin mumbai main police shaayad nahin maan pai ki koi mard-aurat marji se ek kamare main hai to vahaan nahin ghusaa ja saktaa
 There are many hotels in Madh adjoining Mumbai which are visited by lover and girlfriend

 police kahati he ki use shikaayat mili thi ki deh vyapaar ho rahaa he

 police bilkul vaise pahunchi jaise kisi apradhi kii talash ke liye jaati he
 Police say that he received a complaint that the prostitution was taking place
 lekin wo ab tak media ko nahin bataa pai ki kisne shikaayat kii, kaise usne shikaayat par pehali nazar main bharosa kiya? or agar maan bhi len ki shikaayat main dam tha to phir police ne kamaron se jodon ko nikaalane kii himakat kyon kii? According to the instructions of the Mumbai Police, all the hoteliers are required to keep the identity of all the guests, which they had completed before giving the room, so why not check the register?

 Filmmaker Anurag Basu feels that films reflect the director's thinking and according to him no director like Rohit Shetty can make a woman-centric film like 'queen' which came out last year
 'barfi' film ke nirdeshak ne yahaan chal rahe enendisi film bazaar main 'fimail proteganist in bollywood today - haau real ij di discorse' vishay par yojit ek satr main kaha ki koi nirdeshak apni filmon main jis tarah mahilaon ko dikhaata he usase akasar mahilaon ke prati uski soch kaa pataa chalata he
 The comments basu ne kaha, 'abhinaytaon or nirdeshkon kaa vyaktitv unke kaam kaa parichaayak hota he
 Anand (L
 Rai) can make ‘tanu Weds Manu’, Vikas (bahl) can make ‘queen’
 lekin rohit shetty jaisaa nirdeshak 'queen' nahin bana saktaa
 It depends on the kind of person you are and the way you look at women
 udhaaharan ke taur par salmaan jo dialog bolte hai, vah shahrukh kabhi nahin bol sakate
 He said that looking at some women-centric films, one should not think that Bollywood has undergone a complete change
 basu ne kaha, 'aapako keval do yaa teen filmon se badlaav ko nahin aankna chahie
 You have to see in the coming years, in which direction we are moving, how people are taking it and (such) how many films are being made
 ' The director of the film 'barfi' said in a session organized on the subject of 'female Protagonist in Bollywood Today - How Real Is the Discourse' at the ongoing NFDC film market here that the way a director shows women in his films is often about women
 His thinking is revealed
 tippaniyan Basu said, “the personality of actors and directors is a reflection of their work
 anand (el raay) 'tanu vaids manu' bana sakate hai, vikaas (bahal) 'queen' bana sakate hai
 But a director like Rohit Shetty cannot make 'queen'
 aap jis tarah ke insaan hai or jis tarah mahilaon ko dekhte hai, yah us par nirbhar karata he
 For example, the dialogue that Salman speaks, Shahrukh can never speak
 ' unhone kaha ki kuch mahila kendrit filmon ko dekhakar yah nahin sochna chahie ki bollywood main puri tarah ek badlaav aa gaya he
 Basu said, 'you should not judge a change from just two or three films
 aapako aane vaale saalon main dekhnaa hoga ki ham kis disha main bad rahe hai, log ise kaise le rahe hai or (is tarah kii) kitni filmein ban rahi hai
 ' basu ne kaha, 'abhinaytaon or nirdeshkon kaa vyaktitv unke kaam kaa parichaayak hota he

 ' bijepi ke varisht netaa jaswant singh ne endie shashan ke dauraan 2003 main helicopter kharid ke mandandon main badlaav kiye jane ke faisle ko sahi bataate hue daawa kiya ki aisa vishuddh rup se vyavsaayik kaarnon se kiya gaya tha, jisase ki ise saude ko pratispardhaatmak banaaya ja sake
 Jaswant Singh, who was the defense minister in the NDA government, told reporters, it is true that the technical criteria was changed at that time, but there is no reason for the hustle and bustle about it, because it was done for good reasons
 
 tippaniyan He said that the original proposal came in the year 2000 and the Air Force said that these helicopters purchased for movement of vips should have the capability to fly up to 18000 feet high
 lekin jab yah prastaav suraksha maamalon kii cabinet samiti main aayaa, to tatkaaleen rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar brajesh mishra ne sahi suzav diya ki ekal vikreta prastaav uchit nahin rahegaa
 At that time only one company made helicopters flying up to a height of 18000 feet
 singh ne kaha ki brajesh mishra ne aisa karke kuch galat nahin kiya tha
 On the allegations being made on former Air Force Chief SP Tyagi, Jaswant Singh said, "we should not make unwarranted allegations against the former Air Force Chief
 yah vayusena or desh donon ke hit main nahin he
 The investigation is underway
 tyaagi khud kah rahe hai ki jaanch jald se jald honi chahie
 Why are you not accepting his suggestion
 unhone kaha, mujhe dukh is baat kaa he ki is tathy ko bhulaayaa ja rahaa he ki is maamle main doshi italy kii company he

 subbarao ne kaha he ki duniya main mandi ke baad ek mandi kaa khatra phir khadaa ho gaya he, aise main kendriya bainkon par vaishvik aarthik samasyaon se nipatane kii jimmedaari hogi
 In a program at New York University's Stern School of Business, Subbarao said central banks would be responsible for dealing with the recession
 maudrik protsaahanon ke jariye is sthiti unhen nipatna hoga
 During the last few months, the recession has started appearing again, governments in developed countries are stuck in a situation of policy jam
 vah alpakaalik vittiya protsaahanon or dirghakaalik vittiya majbootee ke bich santulan bithaane main pasopesh kii sthiti main hai
 Subbarao said that this crisis is similar to the challenge faced by the intellectuals in many respects
 meraa apana anubhav rahaa he ki duniya kii vaastavik samasyaayein padhane vaali kitabon ke samaadhaan se kahin zyada jatil hai
 Earlier in the meeting of the International Monetary Fund, the Reserve Bank Governor said, "time is running out of time and with this, the problems are not being solved
 unhone kaha ki euro kshetra main sarkari rin kaa sankat kaaphi gaharaa rahaa he
 Along with this, America is also suffering from economic crisis, due to which the whole world is under great pressure
 donon apane aap main kaaphi bada jokhim hai
 If both crises increase simultaneously, it will have a wider impact in terms of trade, finance and trust
 rigerv bank governor vishwa bank or imef kii baithkon main bhaag lene ke liye america main hai
 He used to sleep on a bed of bricks with three more people
 us vakt khaane ke liye unhen dalia, ban or kuch sabziyaan mila karte the
 One of his peasant companions, Lu Housheng, said that when he was hungry, no one would see what was getting in the food
 raat main shi jinping apni gupha main dhibree kii raushnee main padhaa karte the
 He was fond of reading
 rajasthan ke maujuuda bajet satr main vah vidheyak paarit kar diya gaya jisamen panchayat raaj sansthaaon ke ukvamidavaaron ke chunaav ladgaye kii nunatam shaikshanik yogyata tay kii gai he
 Along with this, three important steps were announced regarding the private sector
 sabase mahatvapurn elaan shiksha mantri kaalicharan sarraf ne kiya, vah tha nijee vishvavidhyalayon kii nigaraanee ke liye ek niamak sanstha gathit karne kaa
 The government is preparing to bring a bill for this
 darasal haal hi main jodhpur neshnal uniwarsity ke chancelar camel mehta ko girakrataar kiya gaya tha kyonki uniwarsity kii banti hajaaron digriyaan un chaatro ko paise ke badale bechi gai thim jo kabhi class main aae hi nahin
 According to Saraf, similar complaints have been received about a dozen private universities
 sarkaar ab in vishvavidhyalayon kii nigaraanee or farji digriyon kii jaanch ke liye ek panel gathit karnaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, institutions suspect that this is being done to control them
 ek aise hi santhaan ke maalik ne andeshaa jataayaa ki prastaavit niyam ke tahat nijee vishvavidhyalayon se unki kamai kaa ek fisadi hissaa sarkaar le legi or agar ise hatwanaa he to uske liye baari rishwat deni hogi
 The government is also going to make rules to protect students from fraud of private coaching institutes
 par kya vaaki sarkaar bhrasht vishvavidhyalayon par lagaam kasne ko gambhir he yaa phir vah inaki baanh marodakar sirf paisa banane kii jugat main he? rajya sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke aarope pehle se hi lagate rahe hai ki usne centre kii ore se khadaanon kii nilaamee ke sambandh main adhyadesh jari kiye jane se ain pehle khadaanon kaa aavanton manmarjee se kar diya tha
 The government is set to enact the Clinical Establishment Act to monitor private clinics and hospitals
 kuch bade nijee aspataalon ne galat tareeke se sasti jameen kharidi hai yaa phir coditon ke bhav sarkari aspataalon kaa adhigrahan kar liya he
 They are now making huge profits
 ab shikaayatein aa rahi hai ki jin buniyadi sevaaon par bahut maamuli kharch hota he, ye aspataal uske liye bhi baari fees vasuulate hai
 Private doctors have started opposing the government's efforts to make laws
 ve niamak sanstha main police ko pratinidhitiv dene or un doctoron ko bhi is kanoon ke daayre main rakhane kaa virodh kar rahe hai jinke paas indoor suvidha nahin he
 Questions are also arising in this case that how much will the government be able to help the patients after doing this because the government's own efforts in the medical field are also in a bad shape
 rajasthan uniwarsity of health sciensej se sambhddha doosraa medical college jaipur main jald se jald shuru karne kii sarkari yojana bade paimaane par faile bhram ke chalate naakaam ho gai he
 Whether it is a case of entrance examination or improvement in academic standards and placements, this university has already been infamous for its disability
 vishvavidhyalayon yaa aayogon main pichhali congress sarkaar ke niyukt kiye hue adhikariyon ko banaae rakhane kii bijepi sarkaar kii niti ab khatarnaak sabit hoti ja rahi he
 This makes it seem that the government lacks willpower
 yahi vajah he ki nae niyam-kanoon sirf rasmi kavayad jaan padate hai
 The BJP mlas themselves counted the government's failures in the budget session for not meeting basic needs in the state
 rajyamantri anita baghel bhi gussa jaahir kar chuki hai ki congress raaj main viksit adhikari-thekedaar-brokar kaa mafia gathjod or majboot hua he
 Will the government change its attitude now? a post shared by Hrithik Roshan (@hrithikroshan) on Sep 4, 2018 at 11:20pm PDT BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha has once again targeted the central government over demonetisation
 shatrughna ne is baar naam liye bagaiyr piem par hamalaa bolaa he
 He has questioned the survey conducted regarding demonetisation
 shatrughna sinha ne twitor par likhaa ki moorkhon kii duniya main jeena band karen log
 Understand the problems people are having
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki bure vakt ke liye hamaari maa-bahanon kii jamaa kii gai gadhi kamai ko kaledhan se jodna thik nahin
 Shatrughan Sinha has described the survey conducted by PM Modi as 'planned'
 unhone kaha ki surveykshan kuch nihit swaarthon ke liye kiya gaya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked people to give feedback on Notambadi through the Namo app
 reports ke mutabik, 24 ghante main kareeb 5 lakh logon ne ap par survey main hissaa liya

 ) Last month, there was a lot of tension in Salman's house
 nashe main car chalaane, footpath par so rahe 1 aadmi ko kuchalane or 4 ko ghayal karne ke liye salmaan ko doshi paaya gaya
 However, his family stood with him like a strong rock
 lekin unke parivaar ko kya-kya sahan padaa is bare main haal hi main unke pita saleem khan ne apni pratikriya jataai he
 Salim explains, 'I insisted on making all my children more sensitive than intelligent
 maine kai aklmand logon ko apni jindagi bigaadte dekha he
 Salim said that when asked about Salman Khan, Kisselman was kind since his school time
 ek din skool ke principal ne bacchon se kisi ek-ek aise bachche ko apane saath lunch ke liye ghar le jane ko kaha jise mata pita kaam kii vajah se kaaphi samay se ghar se baahar rahete hon
 In such a situation, Salman used to bring 12 children home every day
 har din lunch ke samay unke ghar hangaamaa hota tha
 Many times, he used to take people injured in an accident outside Salman's house to the hospital
 'hit and ran'cese kii sunwaayee kii agali taarikh paas he
 Salim is also very upset
 jo 18 din salmaan ne jail main bitaye, unhen yaad kar saleem imotional ho jate hai
 Salim says that during that time he did not even like to eat his food or turn on AC
 saleem is baat se kaaphi udhaas hai ki aakhirkaar is cese ko'hit and ran'kaa naam kyon diya jaataa he? salmaan haadase ke baad bhaage nahin, kahin gaayab nahin hue, desh chhodkar nahin gaye
 So how did this 'hit and run' happen? 'gangs of vasepur'se charchaa main ibollywood abhinetri huma kuraishika maananaa he ki is film main unki jindagi badal di
 Huma's performance in the film has been highly appreciated
 apni pehali film main parde par mohasina kaa damdaar kirdaar nibhaa chuki huma kuraishi kaa kahana he ki vah ab apane kaam par dhyaan dena chaahati hai
 Huma has completed her second film 'love Shaw Te Chikan Khurana'

 Huma said, 'I am not such a big actress to do films to change my image but i am giving my best in whatever i am getting
 main ek hi cheez ko baar-baar nahin karnaa chaahati
 Under the banner of kunal-huma's unique recipe in "luv Shiva Te Chikan Khurana", Luv Shav Te Chikan Khurana, Huma plays a Punjabi girl
 do november ko parde par aa rahi is film main huma ke saath kunal kapur bhi dikhaai denge
 Huma told about the film, 'it is a fun film

 It is a romantic comedy
 mujhe khushi he ki mujhe alag alag tarah kii filmein karne kaam mauka mil rahaa he

 a post shared by Taryn Manningtm (@tarynmanning) on Jan 21, 2018 at 7:44pm PST Whatever happened on the occasion of Independence Day in Ajmer, Rajasthan, it seems that even though the country has become independent, the society has not become free till today due to its conservative thinking
 rajya kii mahila mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje jis vakt ajmer main swatantraaa diwas ke avasar par jhanda fahraa rahi thim, thik usee vakt mahaj ek ki
 M
 kii duuri par ajmer main hi jo kuch hua, wo samaaj kaa sharmasaar karanevaala tha
 People did not want to leave the woman to show her face by shaming the woman
 magar ye tamaacha he sabhy samaaj ke chehre par
 Seeing the incident, the keeper of the law was a spectacle instead of being ashamed
 ajmer kii ambedkar kachi basti main jamaa bheed kaa insaaf afghanistan se ai kisi talibani tasviir kii yaad dilaati he
 In front of the guardians of the law, that is, the policemen, a woman is tied with a copter and her hair is being cut
 is mahila par basti waalon kaa aarope he ki yah basti ke naujavaanon ko bigaad rahi he
 Wrongs with them, which directly affect the children of the people living here
 bas isi aarope main mahila ko uske ghar se ghaseet kar chauraahey par laayaa gaya
 Women along with men were also involved in this work
 mahila ko bachaane kii bajaay tamaasha dekhtaa rahaa consteblelogon ne is mahila ko pehle to puri basti ke saamne bal kaat kar ganja kar diya or baad main ise ped par baandh diya gaya
 Then it was beaten
 logon ne police ko phone bhi kar diya
 Police also came in time
 ek police consteble maukey par bhi pahunchaa lekin usne mahila ko chhudwane yaa surakshit rup se thane pahunchane ke bajaay maukey par bheed ke insaaf kaa anand lenaa behatar samajha
 In front of this soldier, people made this woman suffer
 is mahila kaa pati uske saath nahin rahata he or uske do chote bachche hai
 It works

 pakistani sena ne elosi par teen sthanon par bina uksaave ke andhadhundh golibari kii, jiskaa bhartiya sena ne bhi karaara jawaab diya
 The Pakistani army had violated the ceasefire in Bhimber Gali sector and Rajouri district of Poonch district on Wednesday

 kuch dinon pehle baxur ke jis nandan gaanv main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke kafile ke vahaan ke sthaneey logon ne jaanaleva hamalaa kiya tha
 JDU rebel leader Sharad Yadav arrived in the same Nandan village on Wednesday and organized a mahapanchayat
 mahapanchayat ke dauraan sharad yadav ne sthaneey mahadalit pariwaron se mulaakaat bhi kii or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par dalit virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sharad Yadav accused Nitish that discrimination has been done in whatever development work has been done in Nandan village
 dalit or mahadaliton kii andekhi kii gai he
 Sharad Yadav said that Nitish Kumar was killed in a fatal attack because of the government's discriminatory attitude
 iske baad se sthaneey dalit or mahadalit pariwaron ko police ke kahar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Sharad Yadav here demanded that the government take back all the firs against all the local people for the attack on Nitish Kumar's convoy
 nandan gaanv main nyaay sangat tareeke se vikaas ke kaary kiye jaaen
 JDU has strongly attacked Sharad Yadav's Mahapanchayat held in Nandan village
 jadyu ne kaha, jis gaanv main mukhyamantri ke upar hamalaa kiya jaataa he usee gaanv main sharad yadav kaa pahunchnaa aisa lagata he jaise vah hamalaavaron kii prashansa karne ke liye pahunche hon
 Party spokesman Sanjay Singh said that the attack on the Chief Minister's convoy is a black chapter for democracy
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki ab sharad yadav ke paas koi kaam nahin bachaa he or isiilie vahanandan gaanvpahunchakar mahapanchayat laga rahe hai
 It is worth mentioning that the local Mahadalit families in Nandan village also met Sharad Yadav and expressed their grief to him
 uttar pradeshmen ambedkar jayanti manaane kii parampara ab se pehle tak bispi main hi rahi he
 But for the first time this year, apart from BSP, BJP and Congress parties also showed tremendous warmth to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti
 samaajawaadee party sarkaar ne ambedkar kii punya thidhi 6 disambar ke maukey par chuttee kaa elaan kar diya
 At the same time, the Congress announced to celebrate Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary throughout the year
 aakhir aise main bijepi bhala kaise peeche rahati, to uttar pradesh main bijepi ke sthaneey netaaon ne aaj ke din daliton ke saath khichdi bhoj kar 'saamaajik samarasata abhiyaan' ke tahat unhen party se judane kaa nyotaa de diya
 Although state level leaders did not participate in these programs, in UP all the district units went to the house of Dalits to socialize with them, inform the party's policies and have a meal program
 lakhanu main aise hi ek kaarykram main rajdhani kii mohanlalganj lok sabha surakshit seat se saansad kaushal kishor or bijepi ke jila adhyaksh ram nivas yadav ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke saath chinahat ke bhainsora gaanv main daliton ke saath khichdi bhoj kiya
 However, along with mention of Baba Ambedkar's policies regarding bjp's Ambedkar Prem and Dalits, BJP leaders whipped up BSP supremo Mayawati and her party BSP
 bijepi saansad kaushal kishor ne mayawati par daliton ko gumraah karne kaa iljaam to lagaaya hi upi main daliton kii kharaab sthiti kaa thikra bhi unheen par phod diya
 Clearly, BJP is eyeing the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections in 2017 and the party wants to completely eliminate the BSP by taking advantage of the gains against the BSP in the Lok Sabha in these elections
 jamini hakeekat dekhen to sachmuch daliton or bijepi ke bich nazdikiyaan badhati dikhaai detii hai
 People belonging to the Dalit society also do not deny that in the last Lok Sabha elections, there has been different thinking about the politics of Dalits
 dalit ab khud ko samaaj kaa shoshit hissaa maanane ke bajaae apni pahchaan bataur hindu maanakar mukhyadhara kaa hissaa banane main zyada garv mahasoos kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the bsp's vote bank has continued to slide after the 2012 assembly elections
 2007 main 403 siton vaali upi vidhansabha main 207 siten se bahumat paane vaali party 2012 chunaavon main 80 siton par simat gai
 However, after not winning a single seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the bsp's national party status has also been in danger
 aise main 'saamaajik samarasata abhiyaan' ke tahat dalit vot bank ko lubhaane kii bijepi kii koshish ab bispi ke liye khatre kii ghanti sabit ho sakati he
 BJP MP Kaushal Kishore said, 'BJP wants to establish an egalitarian society in India
 yahi baba bhimrao ambedkar kaa bhi sapana tha
 For this, the party gave Mayawati several times, even weakened her party and tried to fulfill the mission of Baba, but she did nothing to uplift the Dalits
 is kaarykram se party apana dalit votbank to majboot karnaa hi chaahati he saath hi daliton ko ye bhi bataanaa chaahati he ki aap abhi tak jin logon ke peeche chalate aae unhone aapke liye kuch nahin kiya par agar aap bijepi ke saath judenge to 'sabakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas' ke tahat dusron ke saath-saath aapkaa bhi vikaas or utthan hoga

 Intelligence agencies could not gather any information about China preparing for war against India
 parinamswaroop 1962 main bharat-china yuddh ho gaya jisamen bharat ko haar ke saath-saath badi keemat chukaani padi
 After this, the war with Pakistan in 1965 was also a result of our intelligence failure
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne IB ke itar RAW kaa gathan 1968 main kiya or rameshwar nath kaav uske mukhiya bane
 Until 1977 it was a secret wing, but it was revealed by a mistake by the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai
 us samay bhi RAW or mosaad sikret mishan ke rup main kaam kar rahe the
 This secret mission came to an end after a lapse of Morarji Desai after being together for nearly 10 years
 1984 ke indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad RAW vittiya sankat se jujhane laga
 Due to this, his intelligence grip in other countries was loosened and the security threat on India increased

 Taking care in promoting promotions, a senior BJPBJP MP said that during the three-day brainstorming session between the RSS and the BJP, it was felt that some non-union background people who had entered the party had gained power, convenience And after indulging in the post, he changed his stand overnight and said that he has a basic alliance with the party

 Am disappointed that Centre continues its step-motherly treatment to delhigariba-kisaan-majdoor ko niraashaa; berozegaar yuvaaon ko hataasha; kaarobaariyon, mahilaon, naukareepesha or aam logon ke munh par tamaacha
 This is the disastrous budget of the arrogant government ignoring the problems of the people
 aakhri bajet main bhi bhaajapa ne dikhaa diya ki wo keval amiron kii himachati he
 Now the public will answer
 Disappointing # Budget2018
 Not a single extra rupee increased in Delhi's share in Central taxes since 2001-02, stays at Rs 325 Cr
 No other part of India gets such treatment
 BJP govt at center continues to treat Delhi residents as second-grade citizens
 n / 1 - Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 BJP govt at Center continues to treat Delhi residents as second-grade citizens
 n / 1delhi police comes under center
 Yet no plans or schemes announced to tackle crime and issues of women safety that have made Delhi the crime capital of India
 Highly disappointing # Budget2018! n / 2 - Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 n / 2land in Delhi comes under Centre
 Yet no plans announced to regularize unauthorised colonies or give more land to Delhi govt to build clinics, schools, hospitals and bus depots
 Highly disappointing # Budget2018! n / 3I had personally requested a special package for 2000 electric buses for Delhi, which could have played a major role in combating air pollution
 Unfortunately, BJP govt does not care for Delhi
 n / 4 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) February 1, 2018 n / 4 Modi government did nothing on the ground and neither is doing it
 sarkaar sirf kaagazon par baton ke pakora or jumalon ke bataashe utaar rahi he
 # Budget2018 Nothing for Bihar in the budget
 bihar ko vishesh package or vishesh rajya ke darje par kuch bhi nahin mila
 Nitish Kumar tell, is this double engine for him? Because of Nitish ji, the central government of BJP is treating Bihar with steps
 bajet kisaanon ke saath chhalaava he
 The minimum support price of wheat is Rs 1600 per quintal, but no wheat is going to be bought at that price in the market
 majabuuran kisaan ko 1300 me gehun bechnaa padataa he
 Whose thing is it to give one and a half times MSP? Do not write the fate of farmers by sitting in air-conditioned cabins
 kisaanon kii kheti kii chintaa chhod modi sarkaar voton kii kheti main leen he
 BJP wants to eliminate farmers from the country
 poonjipatiyon kaa NPA 10 lakh karod he lekin poonjipatiyon kii rakhwali modi sarkaar 80 karod kisaanon kaa kuch hazaar karod rupye qarz maaf nahin kar sakati
 Farmers are equally concerned, so why not forgive their debt and the income will increase even more
 After servicing the Capitalist, oligarch and Khas Aadmi for four years suddenly Govt feels that it can fool the Farmer, the labourer, the small artisan, the salaried professional that it cares about them too in an election year
 Hell hath no fury like a nation scorned

 petroleum mantri jaipal reddy kaa kahana he ki tel kii keemten badhaane kii sakht jarurat he lekin petrol ke daam badhaane par abhi faisla nahin kiya jayega
 The petroleum minister argues that the rupee has depreciated against the dollar, causing a huge loss to the oil companies, although the decision to increase the prices will be made with everyone's consent
 asgabat main turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-bharat pipeline qaraar par dastakhat ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle reddy ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘mulya vruddhi behad jaruri he, lekin hamen raajnneetik dalon se baat kerani hogi
 The government had freed petrol price control in June 2010
 petrol ke daam main aakhri baar badhotaree pichley saal 4 november ko kii gai thi
 However, during this period, the price of crude oil has increased by 14 per cent whereas the rupee has weakened by 7 per cent against the dollar
 dijal, mitti tel or rasoi gas ke daam aakhri baar pichley saal june main badaye gaye the
 Reddy said that if the rupee is one rupee weaker than the dollar, then petroleum companies will incur a loss of Rs 8,000 crore annually
 ‘rupaya is samay girakar 55 rupee prati dollars par aa gaya he, jabaki pichley saal yah 46 rupee prati dollars par chal rahaa tha
 In this way, the rupee depreciation causes petroleum companies to lose Rs 72,000 crore
 ’reddy ne kaha ki in sabhi paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue kuch karne kii jarurat he
 'I can't say when or how it will happen
 ’ keemat badhaane yaa na badhaane ke bare main abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 Public sector petroleum companies lost Rs 4,860 crore on the sale of petrol in the financial year ended March 31, 2012

 The last revision in petrol prices was on December 1 last year

 The team also visited the futures market there, which is the biggest center of the region
 vahaan ke kuch sthaneey sampark sutron ke jariye hi hamaari team ne satta bazaar kii gatividhiyon or rate kaa pataa lagaaya
 Speculators are assuming BJP dominates in all the four states, a bookie said that the election results have been predicted in the four states
 uske hisaab se madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepi kii vaapasi tay he jabaki dilli or rajasthan main bijepi congress kii mukaable majboot bataai jaati he
 For BJP, the price of 80 paise on rupee is 80 paise on BJP while 1 on Congress

 rajasthan ke bare main satorion kaa kahana he ki bijepi ko vahaan 115 se 117 siten mil sakati hai
 It says that the Congress can get 23 to 25 seats in Delhi
 bahucharchit aam aadmi party ke bare main uskaa kahana he ki use sirf 4 se 5 siten mil sakati hai
 It seems to be on a large scale that the passtories told that there are four to five big players in this game

 Because of this some have shifted from here to Delhi and around and are operating from there
 vyapaaree in satorion ke jariye hi paise laga rahe hai
 Another bookie told that the network of big players is spread to big cities like Mumbai, Jaipur

 The government introduced the much-discussed Lokpal Bill in the Lok Sabha on Thursday
 is vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko prastaavit bhrashtachar nirodhi nikaay ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 The main opposition party BJP objected to this
 carmik, lok shikaayat or pension rajya mantri ve
 Before Narayanasamy introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha, Speaker Meira Kumar gave the Leader of the Opposition Sushma an opportunity to make his point
 sushamaa ne pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre se baahar rakhane ke praavdhaan par aapatti jataayi or kaha ki jab aapraadhik kanoon or bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon ke tahat pradhanmantri ko abhiyojan se chhot nahin mili he to unhen lokapal ke daayre se baahar kyon rakhaa gaya he
 Everyone has the right to equality under the constitution
 vidheyak main praavdhaan he ki pradhanmantri padmukt hone tak lokapal ke daayre main nahin aaenge
 There is no provision in the Bill under which the conduct of mps within Parliament and the High Judiciary come under the purview of Lokpal, which was suggested by Anna Hazare's side
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa ne kaha, aisa pehali baar hua he jab lokapal ke daayre main sabhi kendriya mantriyon ko to rakhaa gaya he, lekin pradhanmantri ko chhod diya gaya he
 i do not understand why this was done
 sushamaa ne kaha, rajg kii sarkaar ne jo vidheyak taiyaar kiya tha, usamen pradhanmantri pad ko lokapal ke daayre main rakhane kaa praavdhaan tha
 The bill was referred to the standing committee
 tab maujuuda sadan ke netaa (pranab mukherjee) us sthaayee samiti ke adhyaksh the or unhone bhi pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main rakhane kaa praavdhaan sweekaar kiya tha
 Sushma said that when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself has said that he wants to come under the purview of Lokpal, then why did the cabinet not accept his views
 unhone sarkaar se vidheyak main sanshodhan karne ko kaha
 Sushma said, we cannot allow the Bill to be reestablished in this way
 sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee ne kaha, yah sahi he ki main tatkaaleen loksabhaa main sthaayee samiti kaa pramukh tha or maine 16 farvari 2002 ko sthaayee samiti kii report sadan main pesh kar di thi
 After this, the NDA government was in power for two years
 aakhir kya kaaran rahe ki usne do varsh tak yah vidheyak nahin laayaa
 The need for a strong and effective Lokpal institution has long been felt in the country
 prashasnic sudhaar samiti ne kareeb chaar dashak pehle lokapal kii sthapana karne kii sifarish kii thi
 In view of this recommendation, the Bill has been introduced in the Parliament eight times in the year 1968, 1971, 1977, 1985, 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2001
 maujuuda vidheyak main kaha gaya he ki lokapal main ek adhyaksh or aath anya sadsy honge
 Half of them will be from the judiciary
 lokapal ke paas apni abhiyojan or jaanch ikai hogi
 The Bill states that the Prime Minister will come under the purview of the Lokpal after his release
 saath hi kendriya mantri, sansad sadsy, samooh e yaa uske samakaksh ke kisi adhikari, sansad dwaara paarit kanoon ke tahat kisi nikaay, board, nigam, praadhikaran, company, socity, nyaas or swashaasi nikaay ke adhyaksh yaa sadsy, samooh e ke samakaksh adhikari tathaa centre sarkaar ke aanshik yaa purna vittiya niyantran vaale yaa janata se daan praapt karne vaale nikaay lokapal ke daayre main rahenge
 The Ombudsman will not have to obtain approval under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973 and Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 in cases likely to be prosecuted in future
 lokapal ko talaashi or jabti kii shakti or divaani adaalat ke samaan shaktiyaan praapt hongi
 The Ombudsman or any investigating officer authorized by him shall be able to attach such property which was prima facie acquired by corrupt means
 lokapal ke samaksh shikaayatein daakhil karne ke liye kathith aparaadh hone kii taarikh se saat varsh tak kii samay seemaa hogi
 The Ombudsman will have the same powers as the police officers with respect to the investigation
 lokapal ko chalaane ke liye dhanrashi kii vyavastha bharat kii sanchit nidhi ke jariye kii jaaegi
 This proposed anti-corruption body will also be able to take help of the central and state government in conducting the investigation
 lokapal bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe naukarshahon ke tabadale yaa nilamban kii bhi sifarish kar sakegaa
 The Bill also provides that the Lokpal can recommend the setting up of a sufficient number of special courts for hearing cases filed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988
 vidheyak main yah praavdhaan he ki agar koi sarkari karmi apni sampatti kii ghoshnaa nahin kar paata he yaa bhraamak soochna detaa he to yah maan liya jayega ki usne bhrasht tareekon se sampatti jutai he
 The Bill states that prosecution can be made against the complainant on wrong complaints and the provision of punishment in such cases shall be a minimum of two years and maximum of five years

 survey upi kii 403 main se 65 vidhansabha siton par kiya gaya
 4,452 people were consulted at 256 polling booths
 pradhanmantri modi ne apane duusare kaarykaal main gramin vikaas or krishi mantralay narendra singh tomars ko saunpa he
 This is an attempt to connect the two ministries, so that the situation of separation does not arise and the work can be coordinated in a better way
 modi sarkaar kaa gramin vikaas main trek record acha rahaa he
 But its success did not benefit from agriculture
 gramin vikaas ke tahat saal 2014 se 2019 ke bich pradhanmantri awaas yojana-gramin ke tahat 1
 55 lakh crore houses were built
 jabaki pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana ke tahat 2
 18 lakh km of roads were built
 2 oktober 2014 se lekar svachh bharat mishan-gramin ke tahat 9
 58 crore toilets were built
 ujjwala skim ke tahat april 2015 se ab tak 11
 28 crore new LPG connections distributed
 pradhan mantri saubhaahgya yojana ke tahat bina bijli vaale gramin pariwaron (kul 21
 2 out of 45 crore)
 63 karod se ghataakar 18,734 tak pahunch gai
 But among all this, the agricultural sector did not get the benefit it should have
 gramin vikaas par jis tarah kaa focus dikhaa, dedline tay kii gai or skiimon ko lagu kiya gaya, vaisaa focus or scale krishi kii skiimon main nadaarad dikhaa
 For example, the insurance companies benefited more from farmers than the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme
 jitna companiyon ko premium mila, vah clem bhugtan se zyada tha
 Claims payments were significantly delayed due to lack of proper system and crop losses
 anya skiimon jaise i-nam (puure desh kii krishi mandiyon ko jodne vaala portal), soil health cards, paramparaagat krishi vikaas yojana yaa rashtriya gokul mishan kaa bhi jameen par gaharaa prabhaav nahin dikhaa
 PM Narendra Modi may have been talking about doubling the income of farmers by 2022 but his first term was not good for agriculture income
 saal 2014 se lekar 2019 tak krishi kshetra ke sakal mulya main ausat vaarshik vruddhi sirf 2
 9 percent (fixed prices), while the current price increase is only 7
 6 pratishat
 Both ministries would be better served by giving them to the same minister
 ise sudhaar kii disha main behatar kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Even though MGNREGA is seen as a rural scheme, if it is integrated with agriculture, then it worked to double the income of farmers
 june 2018 main mukhyamantriyon ke ek samooh ne kisaanon kii aay badhaane ke liye baithak kii thi

 Appreciating the initiatives taken by India to tackle the global financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated that 6
 3 fisadi aarthik vikaas dar kaa uskaa purvanumaan bharat ke sambhavit vikaas se kam he
 Kalpana Kochhar, IMF Deputy Director (asia Pacific Region) said that we have reduced India's forecast for the 2009 calendar year to 6

 The UP government is claiming quicker and more compensation
 lekin rajya ke kuch hisson main jamini hakeekat kuch or sachai bayaan kar rahi he
 There are hundreds of farmers in the Modinagar tehsil of Ghaziabad whose crops have been damaged due to hail and heavy rains but have not yet received compensation
 wo ab tak sarkari amale kaa intazaar hi kar rahe hai
 When the NDTV team reached the farm of wheat farmer Sansarvati in Aurangabad Gadana village of Modinagar, hail and heavy rains were clearly visible
 sansarvati kahati hai, 'pichley do maheenon se zila prashasan se muaavze kii guhaar laga rahi hai lekin ab tak prashasan kii taraf se nuksaan kaa akalan karne bhi koi nahin aayaa
 "he told NDTV," 70 to 90 percent of my wheat crop has been destroyed
 maine 10 bigha khet par gehun boyaa tha
 
 
 Wheat was expected to produce 30-40 quintals on an average but hail ruined everything
 prashasan kii taraf se ab tak kuch bhi muawza nahin mila he
 'harinder Nehra, a wheat farmer who has been farming in this area for five decades, says, so much rain and hail never fell in march-april
 ' harinder singh nehra duusare prabhavit kisaanon ke saath milakar zila prashasan se teen baar madad kii guhaar laga chuke hai lekin prashasan ne ab tak unki madad ke liye koi pahal nahin kii he
 Ishwar Singh Dahiya, a farmer from nearby Bhojpur village, says that the state government is dealing with farmers in Ghaziabad
 unka aarope he ki shuruyaat main ghaziabad ko prabhavit zilon kii suchi main shaamil nahin kiya gaya jisaki vajah se unhen aaj bhatakana pad rahaa he
 Actually the scope of wheat farmers' crisis in Uttar Pradesh is quite large
 rajya main 10
 The wheat crop on 58 lakh hectares of land has been affected so far
 yani lakhon kisaan prabhavit hue hai
 It will be important to see how long the state government is able to provide compensation to all affected farmers

 Varanasi's politics has taken a different turn after Mukhtar Ansari's weapon in Varanasi and the bugle of Modi's protest
 arvind kejariwal hon yaa congress umidavaar ajay raay sabhi modi ko haraane ke liye dabi jubaan main ek duusare kaa samarthan karte najar aa rahe hai
 At the same time, the movement of planets is also increasing the distance of Modi and the chair
 kaashi main virdohi partiyaan modi ke khilaaf lamaband hone kii koshish main jute gai hai
 After Mukhtar's brother Afzal Ansari's declaration (whichever party will stand against Modi), the public is seeing the local candidate of Congress Ajay Rai for the first time, while Ajay Rai is also welcoming the support of Mukhtar in the suppressed tongue Huh
 ajay raay kehete hai, 'ladaai dhartiputra banaam bahari kii he
 Fija changed the day Ajay Rai's name came
 main ye samajhataa hum ki deshhit main sapa or bispi ko congress kaa saport karnaa chahie
 The election equation of Varanasi also seems to be changing now
 kaashi kii janata bhi modi ke bajaay ajay raay ko zyada tavajjo detii najar aa rahi he, haalanki logon kii raay bhi milijuli he
 Rahul of Kashi says, 'public opinion of Varanasi is Ajay Rai
 ve sthaneey hai or iskaa phayda unhen milegaa
 'political turmoil in the game of planets, Modi's trouble in Varanasi does not end here
 kaashi ke jyotishiyon ke mutabik modi ke grahon kii baadha unhen dharmik nagari main patkhni bhi de sakati he
 Not only this, due to the poor movement of those planets, Modi may have to work tirelessly to get the post of Prime Minister
 yaa phir sambhav he ki pradhanmantri kii kursi hi inase dur chali jaae
 After an in-depth study of the planets of Narendra Modi's horoscope, another thing has come out that these days the planets in Modi's horoscope are continuing
 kundali main brihaspati kaa ku-prabhaav inke chunavi raah main rode atakane ke saath hi piem pad kii raah main kaante utpann kar saktaa he
 Astrologers say that the difference in the horoscope of Modi's nearest rival Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi is strengthening his referendum
 iske saath hi ajay raay ke grahon kii sthiti bhi majboot he jo kahin na kahin narendra modi ke voton par bhi asar daalane kaa kaam karegaa
 Kashi astrologers claim that if Modi does not worship Jupiter soon, he may have to compromise not only Varanasi but also the Prime Minister's chair
 jyotishi or akhil bhartiya vidwat parishad ke sanyojak pandit kameshwar upaadhyaay kehete hai, 'modi kii kundali main rajyog he
 His life is unbeatable, but there will be struggle in life
 pradhanmantri banane main baadha bhi he
 Opponents will be one of the side effects of Modi's horoscope
 rahu ke dwaara aisi paristhitiyaan he, lekin wo isse ladenge
 'jyotishcharya Pandit Rishi Dwivedi says that the horoscopes of Narendra Modi, Kejriwal and Ajay Rai are competing with each other

 All the deceased residents of Godhra, who were returning from the Swaminarayan temple, were returning from the temple, on the highway kedkor-sevalia highway in Kheda district of Gujarat, a major road accident occurred on Sunday

 The accident occurred when all these were returning from the Swaminarayan temple located in Vadtal
 is haadase ke baad haive par donon taraf lagbhag do kilometre lanbaa jam lag gaya
 Traffic on the highway became normal after heavy efforts by the police
 'ek raja nirbansia the', maa kahani sunaaya karti thim
 Around them, four or five children used to sit eagerly at the fists to press the flowers when the story ended

 'there was a king Nirbansiya,' the mother used to say, 'there was great prosperity under his rule
 sab varan ke log apana-apana kaam-kaaj dekhte the
 No one seemed sad
 raja ke ek lakshmi-si rani thi, chandramaa-si sundar or or raja ko bahut pyaari
 The king used to watch Rajkaj and live happily in the palace of the queen
 'mere saamne mere khyaalon kaa raja tha, raja jagapati! tab jagapati se meri daant-kaati dosti thi, donon middle skool main padhane jate
 Both belonged to each other, so it was equal
 main metric paas karke ek skool main naukar ho gaya or jagapati kasbe ke hi vakil ke yahaan muhrrir
 The year Jagpati Muharrir was married, the same year, in a nearby village, but it happened that people wanted to make a spectacle
 ladakiwaalon kaa kuch vishwaas tha ki shaadi ke baad ladki kii vidaa nahin hogi
 The marriage will take place and the seventh whirlpool will fall, when the first farewell will come and then the girl will go to her in-laws' house
 jagapati kii patni thodi-bahut padhi-likhi thi, par ghar kii li ko koun mete! baraat bina bahu ke waapas aa gai or ladakevaalon ne tay kar liya ki ab jagapati kii shaadi kahin or kar di jaaegi, chahen kani-luli se ho, par vah ladki ab ghar main nahin aegi
 But with the end of the year everything went well
 ladakiwaalon ne maafee maang lee or jagapati kii patni apni sasuraal aa gai
 As Jagpati got everything and mother-in-law took the bride's lights and handed over all the keys of the house, the householder explained the way
 jagapati kii maan na jane kab se aas lagaae baithi thim
 He breathed a sigh of comfort
 puja-paath main samay katane laga, dopahariyaan duusare gharon ke aangan main bitne lageen
 But he had breathing problems, so one day he counted his last clocks and called Chanda nearby and explained - 'son, Jagapati is a pamper of great love
 jab se tumhaare sasur nahin rahe tab se iske chote-chote hath ko puraa karti rahi hoon ab tum dhyaan rakhana
 Then he paused and said, "if Jagapati is worth someone, then the relatives have started to cry
 tumhaare baap ne byaah ke vakt naadaani kii, jo tumhen vidaa nahin kiya
 My enemy brother-in-law got a chance
 toomar khadaa kar diya ki ab vidaa karwaanaa naak katwanaa he
 What happened to Jagpati's marriage, a snake was found on the chest of those people
 sochaa, ghar kii izzat rakhane kii aad lekar rang main bhang kar den
 Now son, the shame of this house is your shame
 aaj ko tumhaare sasur hote, to bhala
 
 
 Mother used to say that tears welled up in her eyes, and she was forever silent by handing over Jagpati's care to him
 ek armaan unke saath hi chalaa gaya ki jagapati kii santaan ko, chaar baras intajaar karne ke baad bhi ve god main na khilaa pain
 And Chanda had patience in mind, thinking that he had got a part of the deity in his life
 ghar main chaaron taraf jaise udaartaa bikhri rahati, apanaapa barasata rahata
 He felt as if there was this peaceful coldness in the dark, secluded rooms of the house which misled him
 ghar kii sab kundiyon kii khanak uske kaanon main bas gai thi, har daravaaje kii charamrahat pahchaan ban gai thi
 'one day the king went to the game,' Mother used to say, 'when the king went to the game, he would definitely return to the palace on the seventh day
 par us dfa jab gaye, to saatvaan din nikal gaya, par raja nahin laute
 The queen was very worried
 rani ek mantri ko saath lekar khoj main nikaleen
 'and meanwhile Jagapati had to go to a marriage of kinship
 uske dur rishte ke bhai dayaram kii shaadi thi
 It was said that he will definitely come back on the tenth day
 par chathe din hi khabar mili ki baraat ghar lautne par dayaram ke ghar daaka pad gaya
 An informer had conveyed all the news that the girl-child had filled Dayaram's house with gold and silver, after all the ancestral landlord was the only girl
 ghar aae mehmaan lagbhag vidaa ho chuke the
 Jagpati was also going to walk the next day, but got robbed the same night
 jawan aadmi, bhala khun maanata he! daakevaalon ne jab bandooken chalaai, to sabaki ghigghi bandh gai
 But Jagapati and Dayaram lifted the sticks by patting their chest
 ghar main koharaam much gaya
 Then silence fell
 daakevale baraabar goliyaan daag rahe the
 The outside door was broken
 par jagapati ne himmat badhaate hue haak lagaai, 'ye hawaii bandooken in tel-pilaai laathiyon kaa muqabla nahin kar paayengi, jawaano
 'but the doors kept crumbling year after year, and in the end one bullet went out crossing Jagpati's thigh, the other one fell on the hip above her thigh
 chanda roti-kalapati or manautiyaan maanati jab vahaan pahaunchi, to jagapati aspataal main tha
 Dayaram had a slight injury
 use aspataal se chuttee mil gai thi
 Chanda had to stay in the cells that were made for the relatives of the patients in the hospital for Jagpati's care
 kasbe ke aspataal se dayaram kaa gaanv chaar kos padataa tha
 From second to third, there used to be men coming and going and getting the goods needed
 par dhire-dhire un logon ne bhi khabar lenaa chhod diya
 There was no wound to heal in a day
 jaangh kii haddi chatkh gai thi or kuulhe main oparation se chha: inch gaharaa ghaav tha
 The town had a hospital
 compounder hi marijon kii dekhbhaal rakhte
 The big doctor was for the name or for the big men of the town
 chote logon ke liye to compotor sahab hi ishwar ke avatar the
 The caretakers of the patients ranged from the difficulties of eating and drinking of relatives to the pulse of the patient
 choti-si imaarat main aspataal aabaad tha
 There were only six-seven beds of the patients
 marijon ke kamare se laga dawa banane kaa cameraa tha, usee main ek ore ek aramkursi thi or ek nichi-si mej
 The big doctor used to come and sit on the same chair occasionally, otherwise the Bachn Singh compounder would remain frozen
 aspataal main yaa to faujadaari ke shahid aate yaa gir-gira ke haath-pair tod lenevaale ek-aadh log
 Sixth-sixth time, a woman was seen, as if she never had disease
 kabhi koi biimaar padati to gharavaale haal bataake aath-das roj kii dawa ek saath le jate or phir uske jeene-marane kii khabar tak na milti
 That day Bachan Singh came to change the bandage of Jagapati's wound
 uske aane main or pattee kholane main kuch aisi laaparvaahee thi, jaise galat bandhi pagadi ko thik se baandhane ke liye khol rahaa ho
 Chanda was standing close to her chair
 vah or rogiyon se baat karata ja rahaa tha
 Here he would see for a minute, then his hands would start doing their work
 pattee ek jagah khun se chipak gai thi, jagapati buree tarah karaah uthaa
 a scream came out of Chanda's mouth
 bachansingh ne satark hokar dekha to chanda mukh main dhoti kaa pallaa khonse apni bhayaatur aawaaj dabaane kii cheshtaa kar rahi thi
 Jagapati was left craving like a one-time fish
 bachansingh kii ungliyaan thodi-si thartharaai ki uski baanh par tap-se chanda kaa ansu chu padaa
 Bachhan Singh shivered and his hands touched the habitual Nithurai like a gentle softness
 aahon, karahon, dard-bhari chikhon or chatakhte sharir ke jis vaataavaran main rahete hue bhi vah bilkul alag rahata tha, phodon ko pake aam-sa dabaa detaa tha, khaal ko aalu-sa chhil detaa tha uske man se jis dard kaa ahsaas uth gaya tha, vah use aaj phir hua or vah bachche kii tarah phunk-phunkkar pattee ko nam karke kholane laga
 Looking slowly towards Chanda, whispered, 'ch
 
 
 ch
 
 
 The courage of the patient is broken like this
 'par jaise yah kehete-kehete uskaa man khud apni baat se uchat gaya
 This indifference was met by the monotony of screams and groans, not by the duty to increase the courage of the patient
 jab tak vah ghaav kii maraham-pattee karata rahaa, tab tak kinhin do aankhon kii karuna use ghere rahi
 And while washing his hands, he kept looking at Chanda's bangles full of bangles, who were asking for her happiness
 chanda pani daalati ja rahi thi or bachansingh haath dhote-dhote uski kalaayiyon, hatheliyon or pairon ko dekhtaa ja rahaa tha
 On his way to the dispensary, he called Chanda with a hand gesture and said, 'don't cut the heart short, the thigh wound will heal in ten days, the hip wound will definitely take a few days
 acchhee se acchhee dawaai doongaa
 The medicines are such that let the corpse heal
 par hamaare aspataal main nahin aatin, phir bhi
 "so those medicines cannot come from any other hospital?" Chanda asked
 'aa to sakati hai, par marij ko apana paisa kharachana padataa he unamem
 'bachchan Singh said
 chanda chup rah gai to bachansingh ke munh se anayas hi nikal padaa, 'kisi cheez kii jarurat ho to mujhe bataanaa
 i will take medicines and bring them from somewhere
 mahakme se mangaayenge, to aate-awate maheenon lag jaayenge
 Will ask the city doctor
 takat kii dawaaiyon kii badi jarurat he unhen
 Okay, will be seen
 ' kehete-kehete vah ruk gaya
 Chanda looked at him with gratitude and he felt as if a leaf flying in the storm had found something
 aakar vah jagapati kii khaat se lagakar baith gai
 She kept caressing with her palm
 nakhunon ko apane poron se dabaati rahi
 Slowly the darkness grew outside
 bachansingh tel kii ek laalaten laakar marizon ke kamare ke ek kone main rakh gaya
 Chanda said gently squeezing Jagapati's wrist, 'the compounder was saying
 ' or itnaa kahkar vah jagapati kaa dhyaan aakrisht karne ke liye chup ho gai
 'what were you saying?' Jagapati spoke in a soft voice
 'kuch takat kii davaaiyaan tumhaare liye jaruri hai!''main jaanata hoon
 ''on
 ''dekho chanda, chadar ke baraabar hi pair failaae ja sakate hai
 These medicines do not belong to us
 'aukaat aadmi kii dekhi jaati he ki paise kii, tum to
 '' Will be seen
 ''compounder sahab intjaam kar denge, unase kahoongi main
 "no donation, borrowing will not cure me, if one takes four days
 ''isamen to
 "you don't know, debt is a disease of leprosy, once you feel tired, the mind also becomes sick
" ''lekin 
 
 
 She stopped while saying
 jagapati apni baat kii tech rakhane ke liye duusari ore munh ghumaakar leta rahaa
 And on the third day, Jagpati's head had several medicines of strength, and a cot had also reached for her to lie in the living room of Chanda
 chanda jab ai, to jagapati ke chehre par maansik pidaa kii asankhya rekhaayen ubhari thim, jaise vah apni beemaari se ladane ke alaava swayan apni aatma se bhi lard rahaa ho chanda kii naadaani or sneh se bhi ulajh rahaa ho or sabase upar sahaayta karanevaale kii dayaa se jujh rahaa ho
 Chanda saw it and could not bear it all
 uske ji main aayaa ki kah de, kya aaj tak tumne kabhi kisi se udhaar paise nahin liye? par vah to khud tumne liye the or tumhen mere saamne sweekaar nahin karnaa padaa tha
 That is why he did not hesitate to take it, but today, before accepting him in front of you, your false virility has awakened
 par jagapati ke mukh par bikhri hui pidaa main jis adarsh kii gaharaai thi, vah chanda ke man main chor kii tarah ghus gai, or badi swaabhaaviktaa se usne maathe par haath pherate hue kaha, 'ye davaaiyaan kisi kii meharbaani nahin hai
 i had given the bracelet to sell, have come in it
 ''mujhase poocha tak nahin or
 
 
 Jagapati said, and as the pressure of the mind itself was subdued - it was better to sell the bracelet than to save the mercy of Bachan Singh
 or use halkaa-sa pachhtaawaa bhi tha ki naahak vah rau main badi-badi baaten kah jaataa he, gyaniyon kii tarah sikh de detaa he
 And when Chanda got up to go to sleep in her cell after getting dark, it was said that Bachchan Singh had arranged a bed for her
 kamare se nikali, to sidhi kothri main gai or haath kaa kadaa lekar sidhe dawaakhaane kii ore chali gai, jahaan bachansingh akelaa doctor kii kursi par aaraam se taangen failaae lamp kii pili roshni main leta tha
 Jagapati's behavior was felt by Chanda, and why she should take the blessing of Bachchan Singh from now on, how much jewelry is worth to her husband
 vah bedadak-si dawaakhaane main ghus gai
 Due to the day's recognition he anticipated the condition of the room's table-chair and the medicine-cupboard, the room was still dark, as the light of the lamp only became more light in his circle, condensing the darkness of the corners even more
 bachansingh ne chanda ko ghuste hi pahchaan liya
 He got up and stood up
 chanda ne bheetar kadam to rakh diya, par sahasaa saham gai, jaise vah kisi andhere kuen main apane-aap kud padi ho, aisa kuan, jo nirantar patala hota gaya he or jisamen pani kii gaharaai pataal kii parton tak chali gai ho, jisamen padakar vah neeche dhansati chali ja rahi ho, neeche andheraa ekaant ghutan paap!bachansingh awak takata rah gaya or chanda aise waapas laut padi, jaise kisi kaale pishaach ke panjon se mukti mili ho
 In a moment in front of Bachchan Singh, the whole situation flashed and he pressed the tongue in a very restrained voice from there, as if it was clear in the air - 'chanda!' That voice was so voiceless and so meaningless that it was meaningless, that meaning filled the silence
 chanda ruk gai
 Bachan Singh stopped near him
 saamne kaa ghanaa ped stabdh khadaa tha, uski kaali parchaai kii paridhi jaise ek baar falkar unhen apane vrutt main samet leti or duusare hi kshan mukt kar detii
 The lamp of the dispensary suddenly stopped and the sound of a groan from the patients' room drowned away to the end of the field
 chanda ne vaise hi neeche takate hue apane ko sanyat karte hue kaha, 'yah kadaa tumhen dene ai thi
 "so why was she going back?" Chanda kept quiet
 or do kshan rukkar usne apane haath kaa sone kaa kadaa dhire-se uski ore badha diya, jaise dene kaa saahas na hote hue bhi yah kaam aavashyak tha
 Seeing all his body at once, Bachnasinh set his eyes on her head, across the cloth lying on it, she had long hair full of soft smoothness, whose steamy smell was spreading
 vah dhire-dhire se bolaa, 'lao
 Chanda pushed her hard
 kadaa haath main lekar vah bolaa, 'suno
 Chanda raised questioning eyes towards him
 unamem jhaankate hue, apane haath se uski kalai pakadte hue usne vah kadaa uski kalai main pahana diya
 Chanda quietly walked towards the cell and towards the Bachchan Singh dispensary
 kaalikh buree tarah bad gai thi or saamne khadey ped kii kaali parchaai gahari pad gai thi
 Both had returned
 par jaise us kaalikh main kuch rah gaya tha, chhot gaya tha
 Due to the lack of oil in the lamp which was once burning, the flame of the lamp burst from the middle, the smoke streaks on it, dissolves in the darkness like a snake
 subah jab chanda jagapati ke paas pahaunchi or bistar thik karne lagi to jagapati ko laga ki chanda bahut udhaas thi
 There were countless expressions coming in the face of Chanda moment by moment, in which there was confusion, pain and carelessness
 koi adrishy paap kar chukne ke baad hriday kii gaharaai se kiye gaye pashchaatap jaisi dhoomil chamak?'rani mantri ke saath jab niraash hokar lautin, to dekha, raja mahal main upasthit the
 There was no place for his happiness
 ' maan sunaaya karti thim, 'par raja ko rani kaa is tarah mantri ke saath janaa acha nahin laga
 The queen explained to the king that she could not stop herself due to unwavering love towards the king
 raja-rani ek-duusare ko bahut chaahate the
 One thing kept falling in both of their hearts was that they had no children, the lamp of the dynasty was going to be extinguished
 santaan ke abhaav main unka lok-paralok bigadaa ja rahaa tha or kul kii maryaada nasht hone kii shankaa badhati ja rahi thi
 'on the second day, Bachchan Singh told while healing patients that he has been transferred to Sadar Hospital in Mainpuri and he will leave from the day after tomorrow
 jagapati ne suna, to use bhala hi laga
 Diseases surround the day, Bachingsingh is being reached in the hospital of his city, then some help will continue
 aakhir vah thik to hoga hi or phir mainpuri ke sivaa kahan jayega? par duusare hi kshan uskaa dil akath baaripan se bhar gaya
 Do not know why, as soon as Chanda's attention came to the notice, she started to see some spiky thorns in this information, which could prick her body at any time, she could get hooked when she was a little oblivious
 or tab uske saamne aadmi ke adhikaar kii lakshmana-rekhaayen dhuen kii lakeer kii tarah kaanpakar mitane lageen or man main chupe sandeh ke rakshas bana badal yogi ke rup main ghoomane lage
 And after fifteen or twenty days, when Jagapati's condition improved, Chanda returned home with her
 jagapati chalane-phirane laayak ho gaya tha
 When the lock of the house was opened, the night was bent
 or phir unki gali main to shaam se hi andheraa jharnaa shuru ho jaataa tha
 But as soon as he came to the street, he felt as if he had returned to the capital after cutting forest exile
 nukkad par hi jamuna sunar kii kothri main surahi phinc rahi thi, jiske daraajadaar daravaajon se laalaten kii roshni kii lakeer jhaank rahi thi or kachi tambaaku kaa dhuaan rundhi gali ke muhane par buree tarah bhar gaya tha
 In front, Munshi ji was busy in laying the measles-khatauni in the pits of his jingla cottage, in the dim light of the flask
 jab jagapati ke ghar kaa darwaja khadkaa, to andhere main uski chachee ne apane jangle se dekha or vahiin se baithe-baithe apane ghar ke bheetar elaan kar diya - 'raja nirbansia aspataal se laut aae kulmaan bhi ai hai
 On hearing these words, as soon as she entered the dark vest of the house, Jagpati sat up in gasps, bowed and said to Chanda, 'will you break my arms and legs in the dark? Do not bring the lantern burning inside
 ''tel nahin hoga, is vakt jaraa aise hi kaam
 "you will never have nothing nor oil
" ' kehete-kehete jagapati ekadam chup rah gaya
 And Chanda felt that for the first time today, Jagapati hurt her pointless motherhood so deeply that she had never imagined the depth
 donon khamosh, bina ek baat kiye andar chale gaye
 In the rising silence of the night, both of them had two things in front of them - in Jagapati's ears as someone was saying sarcastically - King Nirbansiya came from the hospital! And Chanda's heart was stinging this - nothing will ever happen to you
 or sisakati-sisakati chanda na jane kab so gai
 But Jagpati's eyes did not sleep
 khaat par pade-pade uske chaaron ore ek mohak, bhayaavana-sa jaal fail gaya
 Lying down, he felt as if his own shape had shrunk to a point, but Bindu had hands, legs and a heartbeat
 kothri kaa ghuta-ghuta-sa andhiyaara, matamaili deevaaren or gahan gufaaon-si almariyaan, jinamein se baar-baar jhaankakar dekhtaa tha or vah sihar uthta tha phir jaise sab kuch tabdeel ho gaya ho
 He felt that his size kept increasing, increasing
 vah manushya hua, lambaa-tagada-tandurust purush hua, uski shiraaon main kuch foot padane ke liye vyakulata se khul uthaa
 His hands became very large, frightening and terrible in proportion to the body, his long nails came out, he became a monster, a monster, a primitive barbarian! phir sab dhire-dhire sthir hone laga or uski saansen thik hoti jaan padin
 Then, after trying so hard that the bell was tied up, his voice cracked, 'chanda!' Chanda's soft rustle made a soft rustle of life in the room
 jagapati apni paati kaa sahaara lekar jhukaa
 He placed trembling feet on the ground and sat down with his head held by the bed of the Chanda
 use laga, jaise chanda kii in sanson kii aawaaj main jivan kaa sangeet goonj rahaa he
 He got up and bowed at Chanda's face
 us andhere main ankhen gadaaye-gadaaye jaise bahut der baad swayan chanda ke mukh par abha footkar apane-aap bikharane lagi
 His maps brightened and Jagpati's eyes lit up
 vah mugdh-sa takata rahaa
 The scattered hair of Chanda, in which the fragrance of milk of the recently born baby's muddy hair, the sweetness and affection of the body juice, and the smoothness and the forehead on which the hair has all the small, soft-soft-soft -while weeping with silk and a slight erasure of the point of Sendur ever applied on it - little impression - little ones sleep without sleep! And like his innocent thorns, the sound of the eyelashes and the breath dissolving in the breathless voice of the soul, thin petals from the petals of the flower, untouched lines lying on them, with only the smell of milk! Mamata before his eyes - She was coy, only Mamta, and the word came out of her mouth, 'baby!' Fearfully, she put a braided hair of her hair on her palm and started pulling it like a finger
 use laga, jaise koi shishu uske ank main aane ke liye chatpataakar, niraash hokar so gaya ho
 After spreading both the palms, he tried to fill his head in his range that some hard thing hit his fingers 
 vah jaise hosh main aayaa
 With great support, he searched under Chanda's head
 ek roomaal main bandhaa kuch uske haath main aa gaya
 He sat on the ground, resting himself, opened the handkerchief in the same darkness, so as the snake sniffed, both the gold rings of Chanda's hands were wrapped in it! Began to disintegrate
 ye kade to chanda bechakar uskaa ilaaj kar rahi thi
 He had said all those medicines and tonics of strength, these medicines are not kind to anyone, i gave them to sell hard hands, but his throat got badly dried up
 jabaan jaise taalu se chipakkar rah gai
 He wished to raise the fund by shaking it, but the power of the body was washed away, the blood became water
 thodaa sanyat hua, usne ve kade usee roomaal main lapetakar uski khaat ke kone par rakh die or badi mushkil se apni khaat kii paati pakadakar ludhak gaya
 Chanda lie! but why? Strictly hidden till today
 usne itnaa bada duraav kyon kiya? aakhir kyon? kisalie? or jagapati kaa dil baari ho gaya
 He again felt that his body was shrinking and he remained a structure made of a sink, very light, straws, like straws flying in the air
 us raat ke baad roj jagapati sochataa rahaa ki chanda se kade mangekar bech le or koi chota-motaa kaarobaar hi shuru kar de, kyonki naukari chhot chuki thi
 After the absence of such a day, the lawyer had placed another Muharrair
 vah roj yahi sochataa par jab chanda saamne aati, to na jane kisi asahaay-si uski avasthaa ho jaati
 He would feel as if he would take away the post of wifehood from Chanda by asking for it hard
 maatrutiv to bhagwaan ne chin hi liya vah sochataa aakhir chanda kya rah jaaegi? ek stri se yadi patnitv or maatrutiv chin liya gaya, to uske jivan kii sarthakata hi kya? chanda ke saath vah yah anyaay kaise kare? usase duusari aankh kii roshni kaise maang le? phir to vah nitant andhi ho jaaegi or un kadon kii maangane ke peeche jis itihaas kii aatma nangi ho jaaegi, kaise vah us lajja ko swayan hi udharkar dhaanpega?or vah unheen khayaalon main duba subah se shaam tak idhar-udhar kaam kii toh main ghumta rahata
 Borrow from someone? But on what property? What does he have, on the basis of which someone will give him something? And the people of the locality give life to each pie, when buying something, after getting a penny less in the price, they save a penny by walking for miles, by tying spices of one paise each and adding eleven times the amount of money
 Borrowing, pleading brings the deal home; If someone with a screwdriver gets stuck in the street, then by fighting two things of money - with the intention of getting four grains more - they get two places tied up
 bhav ke jaraa-se fark par ghanton bahes karte hai, shaam ko sadi-gali tarkariyon ko kifayat ke kaaran laate hai, aise logon se kis munh se mangekar vah unki garibi ke ahsaas par thokar lagaae!par us din shaam ko jab vah ghar pahunchaa, to barothe main hi ek cycle rakhi najar ai
 Even after putting a lot of emphasis on the mind, he could not imagine the visitor
 bhitaravaale darvaaze par jab pahunchaa, to sahasaa hansee kii aawaaj sunakar thithak gaya
 There was a strange frenzy in that laughter
 or uske baad chanda kaa swar -'ab aate hi honge, baithiye na do minute or! apni aankh se dekh lijie or unhen samajhaate jaaie ki abhi tandurusti is laayak nahin, jo din-din-bhar ghoomana bardaasht kar saken
 "yes brother, weakness cannot be eradicated so soon, if you do not care, you will suffer!" It was a male voice
 jagapati asamanjas main pad gaya
 Should he go in? What is the harm in this? But when he raised his feet, he was going out
 baahar barothe main cycle ko pakadte hi use sujh ai, vahiin se jaise anjaan banataa bade praytn se aawaaj ko kholta chillaaya, 'are chanda! yah cycle kiski he? koun meharbaan
 'chanda came out of the room after listening to her voice, as she was listening to the good news,' sahab his compounder
 khojate-khojate aaj ghar kaa pataa paae hai, tumhaare intajaar main baithe hai
 '' Who saved? Good good
 vahi to main kahoon, bhala koun
 'jagapati reached near, and got entangled in things as if she had accepted the whole situation
 bachansingh jab phir aane kii baat kahkar chalaa gaya, to chanda ne bahut apanepan se jagapati ke saamne baat shuru kii, 'jane kaise-kaise aadmi hote hai
 ''why, what happened? How are men? Jagapati asked
 'itani choti jaan-pahchaan main tum mardon ke ghar main na rahete ghuskar baith sakate ho? tum to ulte pairon laut aaoge
 Saying 'chanda', Jagpati's eyes started to look deeply to see some desired reaction
 jagapati ne chanda kii ore aise dekha, jaise yah baat bhi kehane kii yaa poochne kii he! phir bolaa, 'bachansingh apni tarah kaa aadmi he, apni tarah kaa akelaa
 Chanda stopped while saying 'at will'
 'aade vakt kaam aane vaala aadmi he, lekin usase phayda uthaa sakna jitna aasaan he utana dheera matlab he ki jisase kuch liya jayega, use diya bhi jayega
 Jagapati said with her eyes on the wall
 or chanda uthakar chali gai
 After that day, Bachchan Singh started coming and going almost daily
 jagapati uske saath idhar-udhar ghumta bhi rahata
 As long as he lived with Bachchan Singh, a strange suffocation would bind his heart, and then all the oddities of life also began to appear before his eyes, after all he himself is a man, it is useless to believe that he has such a terrible need to feed him
 No problem, he is not dying of hunger, he is not shivering in the winter, but he has two arms and legs, is a body cage, which asks for something! And he thinks, what is this something? happiness? maybe maybe not
 vah to du:kha main bhi ji sakane kaa aadi he, abhaavon main jivit rah sakane vaala ascharyajanak keedaa he
 Then lust? maybe maybe not
 chanda kaa sharir lekar usne us kshanikta ko bhi dekha he
 Then money maybe yes, maybe no
 usne dhan ke liye apane ko khapaaya he
 But even he could not quench that invisible thirst
 to phir? to phir kya? vah kuch kya he, jo uski aatma main nasoor-sa risataa rahata he, apana upachaar maangata he? shaayad kaam! haan, yahi, bilkul yahi, jo uske jivan kii ghadiyon ko nipat suunaa na chode, jisamen vah apni shakti laga sake, apana man dubo sake, apane ko sarthak anubhav kar sake, chaahe usamen sukh ho yaa dukh, araksha ho yaa suraksha, shoshan ho yaa poshan use sirf kaam chahie! karne ke liye kuch chahie
 This is his natural need, the first and the last demand, because he was not born in the house where only those who rule by shaking their tongues
 vah us ghar main bhi nahin paidaa hua, jahaan sirf mangekar jenevaale hote hai
 He belongs to the house, which only knows how to work, work which is expected
 sirf vah kaam chahta he, kaam
 And one day his work problem was also solved
 talab vaale unche maidan ke dakshin ore jagapati kii lakdi kii taal khul gai
 Tung to the board
 taal kii jameen par lakshmi-pujan bhi ho gaya or havan bhi hua
 There was no shortage of wood
 gaanv se aanevaali gadiyon ko, is kaarobaar main pare hue aadamiyon kii madad se mol-tol karvaa ke vahaan girava diya gaya
 The knots were placed side by side, the chalets were fastened neatly, and the pits were cast to rip
 do-teen gadiyon kaa sauda karke taal chaalu kar di gai
 It was decided to cut down the trees by purchasing in the future
 badi-badi scimen baniin ki kis tarah jalaane kii lakdi se badhaate-badhaate ek din imarti lakdi kii kothi banegi
 a new sawing machine will be installed
 karbar bad jane par bachansingh bhi naukari chhodkar usee main lag jayega
 And he felt that he had got used to the work, now the work is in front of him round the clock, the use of his time
 din-bhar main vah ek ghante ke liye kisi kaa mitra ho saktaa he, kuch der ke liye vah pati ho saktaa he, par baaki samay? din or raat ke baaki ghante un ghanton ke abhaav ko sirf uskaa apana kaam hi kar saktaa he or ab vah kaamadaar tha
 He was a worker, but when he sat on a plank under the thatch on that high ground, saw a pile of wood in front, trunk of chopped trees, and saw the roots rolled away, a careful barrage bound his heart
 Seemed to be
 use lagata, ek vyarth pishaach kaa sharir tukade-tukade karke uske saamne daal diya gaya he
 Then the ax will be run on them and their fibers will be separated and then their bails will be dried and weighed on the hands of a money seller
 or tab uski nigahen saamne khadey tad par atak jaatin, jiske bade-bade patton par surkh gardanvaale giddh par fadafadaakar der tak khamosh baithe rahete
 The black padded trunk of palm and the shivering tremble in the air in front of it, the weightless neem leaves fluttering, the leaks of the wheels of wooden carriages on the dusty earth, the faint blurring and the monotonous sound of the adjacent coral fowl Used to fill in the ears
 bagalvaali kachi pagadendi se koi guzarakar, tile ke dhalaan se talab kii nichai main utar jaataa, jiske gandale pani main kooda tairta rahata or boar keechad main munh daalkar us kooday ko raundte
 In the afternoon, and the evening mist would set in, he would burn the lantern and hang it in the nail of the thatch pillar, and shortly after that Bachn Singh would appear like a black spot on the hospital road
 gahare padate andhere main uskaa aakaar dhire-dhire badhata jaataa or jagapati ke saamne jab vah aakar khadaa hota, to vah use bahut vishaal-sa lagane lagata, jiske saamne use apana astitv duubataa mahasoos hota
 There was talk of a half-sale and then both would walk towards the house
 ghar pahunchakar bachansingh kuch der jarur rukta, baithta, idhar-udhar kii baaten karata
 If there was an opportunity, Jagapati and Bachchan Singh's plate would also be attached
 chanda saamne baithkar donon ko khilaati
 Bachhan Singh used to say, 'what a trick
 masala aisa padaa he ki uski bhi bahaar he or tarkari kaa swaad bhi na mara
 In the hotels, either masala will remain the spice or only tarkari is the tarkari
 vaah! vaah! kya baat he andaaj kii!'or chanda bich-bich main tokkar bolti jaati, 'inhen to jab tak daal main pyaaj kaa bhunaa ghi na mili, tab tak pet hi nahin bharta
 'or -' Vinegar, if found, understand it
 pehle mujhe sirka na jane kaisaa lagata tha, par ab aisa jabaan par chadha he ki
 'or -' They do not like paper-thin bread
 ab mujhase koi patali roti banane ko kahe, to banati hi nahin, aadat pad gai he, or phir man hi nahin karata
 'but Chanda's eyes would remain on the plate of Bachchan Singh
 roti nibati, to roti paros di, daal khatm nahin hui, to bhi ek chamachaa or paros di
 And Jagapati used to eat with his head bowed
 sirf ek gilaas pani maangata or chanda chaunkkar pani dene se pehle kahati, 'are tumne to kuch liya bhi nahin!' kehete-kehete vah pani de detii or tab uske dil par gahari-si chot lagati, na jane kyon vah khamoshi kii chot use badi pidaa de jaati par vah apane ko samajha leti, koi mehmaan to nahin hai maang sakate the
 Will not be hungry
 jagapati khaanaa khaakar taal par letne chalaa jaataa, kyonki abhi tak koi chaukeedaar nahin mila tha
 When he used to lie on the plank under the thatch, he would suddenly get filled with heart
 pataa nahin koun-koun se dard ek-duusare se milakar tarah-tarah kii tis, chatkh or anthan paidaa karne lagate
 Even if one veil hurts, he shrugs, when all the veins crackle, with a single hand of relief, all the while, his gaze rests on the strong tomb on the side of the palm, whose head is a lonely tree of thorny acacia
 Would stand jis kabr par ek pardaanashin aurat bade lihaaj se aakar savere-savere bela or chameli ke phool chadha jaati gum-ghumkar uske phere leti or maathaa tekkar kuch kadam udhaas-udhaas-si chalakar ekadam tezi se mudakar bisatiyon ke muhalle main kho jaati
 It used to come again in the evening
 ek diya barti or agar kii battiyaan jalaati, phir mudate hue odhani kaa pallaa kandhon par daalati, to diye kii lau kaanpati, kabhi kaanpakar bujh jaati, par uske kadam bad chuke hote, pehle dhime, thake, udhaas-se or phir tej sadhe saamaanya-se
 And then she would get lost in the same locality, and then in the night-time, among the thorns of acacia, she would wander alone in the high and low ground, like a spirit coming out of that grave
 tabhi tad par baithe surkh gardanvaale giddh manahuus-si aawaaj main kilbila uthte or tad ke pattey bhayaanakta se khadbada uthte
 Jagapati's body trembled and she could wander in the bricks of the tomb, under the shadow of Acacia, to live a wandering spirit
 jagapati apni taangon ko pet se bheenchakar, kambal se munh chupa aundha let jaataa
 The woodcutters on the contract would come to rip wood in the early hours
 tab jagapati kambal lapet, ghar kii ore chalaa jaataa
 'the king used to go for a walk in the morning,' Mother used to say, 'one day as soon as Mehtarani who swept the street came out, he saw her sweeping her head and started beating her head and said,' Hi Ram! Today, we have seen the face of King Nirbansiya, do not know whether the bread will be destined or not, what disaster will be broken! ' The king felt so sad that his legs returned to the palace
 mantri ko hukum diya ki us mehtaraani kaa ghar naaj se bhar den
 And all of them took off the royal clothes, and at that moment the king went towards the forest
 usee raat rani ko sapana hua ki kal kii raat teri manokamana puri karanevaali he
 The queen was very sorry
 par fouran hi rani raja ko khojati-khojati us sarai main pahunch gai, jahaan vah tike hue the
 The queen turned to Bhatiyarin who served disguised and reached the king at night
 raatbhar unke saath rahi or subah raja ke jagane se pehle sarai chhod mahal main laut gai
 The king got up in the morning and went towards another country
 do hi dinon main raja ke nikal jane kii khabar raaj-bhar main fail gai, raja nikal gaye, chaaron taraf yahi khabar thi
 'and on that day in every courtyard of the locality, like the rain of the rain, the news spread that the child was going to have children
 nukkad par jamuna sunar kii kothri main phinkati surahi ruk gai
 Munshiji stopped putting his mind and listened with wide eyes and listened to the news
 bansi kiraanevaale ne kuen main se aadhi gai rasseen khinch, dol man par patakekar suna
 The Sudarshan tailor heard the wheel of the machine by rubbing it with a palm
 hansraj punjabi ne apni nil-lagi malguji kameez kii aastinein chadhaate hue suna
 And Jagapathi's aunt Beva expressed great faith in the women's gathering, but in a distinct voice - 'today it has been six years, neither the child nor the child, whose sin is in his stomach
 or kiskaa hoga sivaa us mustande compotor ke! na jane kahan se kulchhani is muhalle main aa gai! is gali kii to pushton se aisi marazaad rahi he ki gaiyr-mard aurat kii parchaai tab nahin dekh paae
 The men here only know the women of their house, they do not even know the number of the men of the neighboring house
 ' yah kehete-kehete unka cheharaa tamtamaa aayaa or sab auraten devloak kii deviyon kii tarah gambheer bani, apni pavitrataa kii mahanata ke boj se dabi dhire-dhire khisak gai
 Before the news spread in the morning, Jagpati went on the ditch
 par suni usne bhi aaj hi thi
 Throughout the day, he was facing the corner on the throne
 na theke kii lakadiyaan chiraai, na bikri kii ore dhyaan diya, na dopaher kaa khaanaa khaane hi ghar gaya
 When the night spread well, he woke up like a violent animal
 usne apni anguliyaan chatkai, mut baandhakar baanh kaa jor dekha, to nasen tanin or baanh main kathor kampan-sa hua
 He drew three or four full breaths and walked towards the house with strong steps
 maidan khatm hua kakad kii sadak ai sadak khatm hui, gali ai
 But as soon as he entered into the darkness of the street, he was frightened, as someone grabbed him with invisible hands and squeezed all the blood, keeping ice-cold lips on the vein of his torn power and sucked all the juice
 or gali ke andhere kii hikaarat-bhari kaalikh or bhi baari ho gai, jisamen ghusane se uski saans ruk jaaegi fout jaaegi
 He turned back, but stayed
 phir kuch sanyat hokar vah choron kii tarah ni:shabd kadamon se kisi tarah ghar kii bhitari dehri tak pahunch gaya
 The flask was flickering in the kitchen threshold on the right, and Chanda lay head down on the wall, perhaps asleep, staring at the sky
 kuppi kaa prakaash uske aadhe chehre ko ujagar kiye tha or aadha cheharaa gahan kalimaa main duba adrishy tha
 He stood silently
 chanda ke chehre par naritv kii praudhata aaj use dikhaai di
 i do not know where all the weakness of the face was lost, where was the insanity of it disappeared
 phula-phula mukh
 For example, a flower that has been broken from a branch has been refreshed by putting it in water, whose petals have crimson lines of rupture, but a wetness has caused heaviness
 uske khule pair par uski nigaah padi, to suja-sa laga
 Eddy filled, semolina and a strange dryness near the nails
 jagapati kaa dil ek baar masos uthaa
 He wished to take it up
 apane haathon se uskaa puraa sharir chhu-chhukar sara kalush ponch de, use apni sanson kii agni main tapaakar ek baar phir pavitra kar le, or uski aankhon kii gaharaai main jhaankakar kahe- devloak se kis shaapvash nirvasit ho tum idhar aa gai, chanda? yah shaap to amit tha
 Chanda then opened her eyes in a hurry
 jagapati ko saamne dekh use laga ki vah ekadam nangi ho gai ho
 Extremely embarrassed, he covered his legs
 ghutanon se dhoti neeche sarkai or bahut sanyat-si uthakar rasoi ke andhere main kho gai
 While Jagpati is desperate, the head of the room sat down with a frame
 najar kamare main gai, to laga ki paraye swar yahan goonj rahe hai, jinamein chanda kaa bhi ek he
 Aside from every corner of the house, the darkness was rising like a swamp, a strange flushing dilemma
 gati, par pathbhrasht! shaklein, par aakaarahin
 'eat food,' Chanda's voice was heard in the ears
 vah anjaane aise uth baitha, jaise taiyaar baitha ho
 Till date he had not disobeyed
 khaane to baith gaya, par cor neeche nahin sarak rahaa tha
 Then Chanda said in very simple words, 'tomorrow i want to go to the village
 'jaise vah is soochna se parichit tha, bolaa, 'acha
 'chanda again said,' i had put the letter long ago, brother is coming tomorrow
 ''to thik he
 Jagapati said as he drowned
 chanda kaa band tut gaya or vah vahiin ghutanon main munh dabaakar kaatar-si fafik-fafakkar ro padi
 Could not get up, nor move
 jagapati kshan-bhar ko vichlit hua, par jaise jam jane ke liye
 While bursting his lips and forcibly pressing the volcano of anger, he exploded, 'what is this showing me? shameless! Bajrat! Did not think at that time, when my corpse was fried
 ''tab tabaki baat jhooth he
 'saunda's voice was heard among the sobs,' but when you sold me
 'ek bharpoor haath chanda kii canapati par aag sulgaataa padaa
 And Jagpati, pressing her palm from the other, left the food and entered into the closet and kept kneeling in the same soot overnight
 duusare din chanda ghar chhod apane gaanv chali gai
 Jagpati would spend the whole day and night cutting away, in the same valley, next to the pond, the tomb, Acacia and palm neighborhood
 par man murda ho gaya tha
 He would forcefully stop himself there
 uskaa dil hota, kahin nikal jaae
 But such weakness had hollowed his body and mind that he could not go even if he wanted to
 hikaarat-bhari nazren sahataa, par vahiin padaa rahata
 After a long time, when no longer, Jagapati locked the house, went to the nearby village to chop wood
 use lag rahaa tha ki ab vah pangu ho gaya he, bilkul langadaa, ek rengta keedaa, jiske na aankh he, na kaan, na man, na ichha
 He reached the garden where the purchased trees were to be cut
 do arevaalon ne patale ped ke tane par aara rakhaa or karr-karr kaa abaadh shor shuru ho gaya
 Bunny and Shakure's ax ringed on the second tree
 or gaanv se dur us baag main ek laypurna shor shuru ho gaya
 Had the ax been at the root, the whole tree would have trembled
 kareeb ke khet kii med par baithe jagapati kaa sharir bhi jaise kaanp-kaanp uthta
 Chanda had said, 'but when you sold me
 ' kya vah thik kahati thi! kya bachansingh ne taal ke liye jo rupe die the, uskaa byaaj idhar chuktaa hua? kya sirf vahi rupye aag ban gaye, jisaki aanch main uski sahansheeltaa, vishwaas or adarsh mom-se pigal gaye?'shaqure!' baag se lage dade par se kisi ne aawaaj lagaai
 Shakure stopped the ax and started ranting from there, 'leak has been made from the corner field, a little car and a thumping car
 'jagapati kaa dhyaan bhang hua
 He turned and set his eyes on the shovel
 do bhainsa-gaadiyaan lakdi bharne ke liye aa pahaunchi thim
 Shakure came to Jagapathi and said, "A cart is full, but don't trim the Patriya tree for a month and a half now?" Jagapati looked at the tree which Shakure had pointed to cut down
 ped kii shaakh hari pattiyon se bhari thi
 He said, 'hey, this is green, leave it now
 ''haraa hone se kya, ukht to gaya he
 Neither of flowers nor of fruits
 ab koun isamen fal-phool aayenge, chaar din main pattee jhura jaayengi
 Shakure said to the master, looking at the tree
 'jaisaa thik samajho tum,' jagapati ne kaha, or uthakar med-med pakke kuen par pani pine chalaa gaya
 In the afternoon, the carriage was ready, and proceeded towards the city
 jagapati ko unke saath aana padaa
 The cars were moving towards the city laden with wood, and the shrouded neck drowned in the dust of the rough road, slowly rising lifeless with their ringing bells by heavy footsteps
 'kai baras baad raja pardes se bahut-sa dhan kamakar gaadi main ladakar apane desh kii ore laute, 'maan sunaaya karti thim,' raja kii gaadi kaa pahiyaa mahal se kuch dur patel kii jhaadi main ulajh gaya
 Tried all the way, but the wheel did not come out
 tab ek pandit ne bataaya ki 'sakat' ke din kaa janma balak agar apane ghar kii supaari laakar isamen chuaa de, to pahiyaa nikal jayega
 Two boys were playing there
 unhone yah suna to kudakar pahunche or kehane lage ki hamaari paidaaish sakat kii he, par supaari tab laayenge, jab tum aadha dhan dene kaa vaada karo
 The king agreed
 balak daude-daude ghar gaye
 Took the betel nut and touched it, and then went ahead to show the way home
 aakhir gaadi mahal ke saamne unhone roak lee
 The king was very surprised that from where did these two children come in our palace? When reached inside, the queen was happily disturbed
 'par raja ne pehle un baalkon ke bare main poocha, to rani ne kaha ki ye donon balak unheen ke rajkumaar hai
 The king could not believe it
 rani bahut dukhi hui
 'when the cars started coming up on the stall and sat down with their hands and feet on the jagapati board, Munshiji, who was passing through the trail, came to him and said,' Now that day, in recovery, you had to go to a village near my in-law's place, then find out that fifteen - Twenty days have passed, Chanda's boy is born
 ' or phir jaise muhalle main suni-sunai baton par pardaa daalate hue bole, 'bhagwaan ke raaj main der he, andher nahin, jagapati bhaiya!'jagapati ne suna to pehle usne gahari najaron se munshiji ko taaka, par vah unke tir kaa nishaanaa thik-thik nahin khoj paaya
 But while tolerating everything, he said, "there is both delay and darkness!" Big and big losers have lost, 'munshiji paused, but something like this, as if there is a big secret thing, which his round eyes will explain
 jagapati munshiji kii taraf takata rah gaya
 There was a wretched silence for a minute, breaking it, Munshiji said in a very pained voice, "you must have heard, have you?" "what?" Jagpati was asked to say it, but he thought that now Munshiji would say the same things spread in that village with great disrespect, he asked nonchalantly
 tabhi munshiji ne uski naak ke paas munh le jate hue kaha, 'chanda duusare ke ghar baith rahi he koi madsudan he vahiin kaa
 But the child has become a wall
 chaahate to wo yahi hai ki mar jaae to rasta khule, par raamji kii marji
 It is heard that even when the child is there, he is ready to make Chanda sit
 'jagapati kii saans gale main atakkar rah gai
 Just, the eyes were stoned on Munshiji's face
 munshiji bole, 'adaalat se baccha tumhen mil saktaa he
 Now, why should i ask you to ask me, Baba? Everywhere i am pressed by debt, by body, by heart, by money, by honor, on whose strength should i try to save the world? ' He got lost in himself from time to time
 munshiji vahiin baith gaye
 When night fell, Munshi ji woke up along with Jagpati
 uske kandhe par haath rakhe ve use gali tak laae
 After coming back to his cell, they left him with a back
 vah gardan jhukaae gali ke andhere main unheen khyaalon main duba aise chalata chalaa aayaa, jaise kuch hua hi na ho
 But there was such a burden, which neither let it be thought nor understood
 jab chachee kii baithak ke paas se guzarane laga, to sahasaa uske kaanon main bhanak padi - 'aa gaye satyanasi! kulboran!'usne jaraa najar uthaakar dekha, to gali kii chachee-bhaujaiyaan baithak main jamaa thim or chanda kii charchaa chhidi thi
 But he left quietly
 itane dinon baad taala kholaa or barothe ke andhere main kuch sujh na padaa, to ekaek vah raat uski aankhon ke saamne gum gai, jab vah aspataal se chanda ke saath lautaa tha
 The poison-extinguished arrow of Beva aunty, 'has come from Raja Nirbansiya Hospital
 ' or aaj 'satyanasi! kulboran!' or swayan uskaa vah vaakya, jo chanda ko chhed gaya tha, 'tumhaare kabhi kuch na hoga
 'and that night's baby boy! Chanda's boy is born
 vah kuch or janati, aadmi kaa baccha na janati
 Anything else she produces, pebble-stone! She does not become a woman, the child remains, the child's donation that night
 par chanda yah sab kya karne ja rahi he? uske jite-ji vah duusare ke ghar baithne ja rahi he? kitne bade paap main dhakel diya chanda ko par use bhi to kuch sochna chahie
 After all what? But all this is not good when i live
 vah itani ghrinaa bardaasht karke bhi jeene ko taiyaar he, yaa mujhe jalaane ko
 She considers me vile, if not a coward, she would have taken the news once
 baccha hua to pataa lagata
 But no, who is his? None
 aulad hi to vah sneh kii dhuree he, jo aadmi-aurat ke pahiyon ko sadhakar tan ke daldal se paar le jaati he nahin to har aurat veshya he or har aadmi vaasana kaa keedaa
 So is the lady no more? She was a woman, but i myself put her in hell
 vah baccha meraa koi nahin, par chanda to meri he
 Once brought him, then here in the enchanting darkness of the night, looking at the flowers from his flowers, Nirvandv would cover the untouched smell of the sleeping eyes, looking at the sleeping eyelids
 aaj kaa andheraa! ghar main tel bhi nahin jo diya jala le
 And then who will burn for whom? He had sold it for charity
 sivaa chanda ke koun-si sampatti uske paas thi, jiske aadhaar par koi karj detaa? karj na miltaa to yah sab kaise chalata? kaam ped kahan se katate? or tab shakure ke ve shabd uske kaanon main goonj gaye, 'haraa hone se kya, ukht to gaya he
 'that itself is an uprooted tree, neither of fruit nor of flower, all in vain
 jo kuch sochaa, us par kabhi vishwaas na kar paaya
 Chanda kept on wanting, but could not awaken the desire in his heart
 use kahin se ek paisa maangane par daantata rahaa, par khud letaa rahaa or aaj vah duusare ke ghar baith rahi he use chhodkar vah akelaa he, fir taraf boj he, jisamen uski nas-nas kuchli ja rahi hai, rag-rag fat gai he
 And somehow he frantically reached the house inside
 'rani apane kul-devtaa ke mandir main pahaunchin,' maan sunaaya karti thim, 'apane satitv ko siddh karne ke liye unhone ghor tapasya kii
 The king kept watching
 kul-devtaa prasann hue or unhone apni daivi shakti se donon baalkon ko tatkaal janme shishuon main badal diya
 The queen's umbrellas were filled with milk and a squirt came out of them, which started falling into the babies' mouths
 raja ko rani ke satitv kaa saboot mil gaya
 He held the feet of the queen and said that you are a goddess! He is my son! And from that day the king again took over the reigns
 'par usee raat jagapati apana sara kaarobaar tyaag, opium or tel pikar mar gaya kyonki chanda ke paas koi daivi shakti nahin thi or jagapati raja nahin, bachansingh compounder kaa karjadaar tha
 'the king did two things,' the mother used to say, 'one he built a huge temple in the name of the queen and the other, by digging the name of the elder prince on the new coins of the kingdom, so that his successor would be reported throughout the kingdom
 Go 'jagapati ne marate vakt do parache chode, ek chanda ke naam, doosraa kanoon ke naam
 He wrote to Chanda, 'chanda, my last wish is that you will be able to carry a child, for a day or two, my corpse will be in bad condition, till then you will be able to come
 chanda, aadmi ko paap nahin, pashchaatap martha he, main bahut pehle mar chukaa tha

 supreme court ke teen talaak par bain ke faisle ko lekar muslim varg kii mahilaayein main jashn kaa maahaul ban gaya he
 Not only common people but celebrities are also calling this decision of Supreme Court a commendable step
 pakistan se lekar bollywood tak kai stars court ke is faisle se behad khush hai or apane apane andaaj main is khushi ko jaahir kar rahe hai
 Let us know what the film stars have to say about the decision to ban triple talaq: Pakistani actress Salma Boli should be written in history today, Nagma Agha, who played the lead actress in the Bollywood film Nikah, practice triple talaq in Hindustan The decision to abolish it was a positive decision
 salama aagaa boleen, ye bahut hi positive faisla he, iskaa sara credit piem modi ko jaataa he
 Today should be written in history
 ' salama aagaa ne aage kaha ki naa sirf talakshuda aurat balki uski puri janareshan ko pareshaani uthaani padati he
 Salma said, Whatever the law should be, after 6 months, very tough laws should be made about this issue
 bataa den ki bollywood film nikaah teen talaak par besd film thi or is film main is baat se pardaa uthaaya gaya tha ki ek talakshuda aurat jindagi main kin kin mushkilon kaa saamana karti he
 Even the name of the film was Divorce Divorce Divorce but later it was renamed Nikah due to some reasons
 is film ke bare main salmaal aagaa ne kaha ki mujhe garv he ki hamaari film nikaah ko teen talaak kii pratha khatm karne kaa credit jaataa he
 During that time we took the risk of making this film
 salama aga ne supreme court ke is faisle ke liye piem modi ko credit diya or kaha ki main behad khush hum or unki shukraguzaar hum
 On the opposition of some people to this decision, the actress said, those opposing are opposing this decision for some purpose
 or quran main kahin bhi teen talaak ke bare main nahin likhaa gaya he
 Actress Bhumi Pednekar also welcomed the decision against triple talaq and tweeted that this is an important step towards India's progress

 👍 — Anupam Kher (@anupampkher) August 22, 2017 Anupam Kher's 'nationalist Interview'! Let us know that the hearing in the Supreme Court started after the appeals of Shaira Bano, Afreen Rahman, Gulshan Parveen, Ishrat Jahan and Atiya Sabri 
 sabhi kii ore se teen talaak ke alaava nikaah, halaala or bahuvivaah ke mudde par yachika daayar kii gai thi
 But the court said that we will give verdict on only three divorces
 is yachika ke baad se hi desh main teen talaak ko khatm karne kii muhim chal rahi thi
 Actress Huma Qureshi had said about this mission - 'A revolution has been sprung up where women are coming forward and are taking responsibility
 teen talaak kaa kaaphi pechida ishyu he, mujhe lagata he ki muslim samudaay ko aage aakar koi faisla lenaa chahie, jo bhi badlaav aana he agar wo muslim samudaay ke andar se aae to behatar he
 'neither Islam nor Quran - There is no mention of triple talaq: Bollywood actor Paresh Rawal was also very happy with this decision of the Supreme Court
 paresh rawal ne is faisle ko lekar kaha ki 'is faisle kaa tahadil se swagat karte hai kyonki har muslim mahila apana kaa ek apana sammaan he kisi jaati ke kaaran aapkaa sammaan khatm ho jaae aisa to nahin hona chahie naa or main ye baat sabhi hindustani mahilaon ke liye bol rahaa hum
 And neither in Islam nor in the Quran is written about three divorces, despite this it was a matter of great surprise

 But apart from Yash Raj Films, the two have many other similarities as well, both of which got full support from their mother, both are humorous, both are of independent views
 donon aatmavishvaas se labarej hai lekin unamem dambh nahiraniah maine apane shuhar (aditya chopra) se suna he ki aap jab abhinetri bani thim to hindi filmein bahut zyada nahin dekhati thim
 You auditioned for Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) and i remember seeing your audition, i said, "my God, this girl has so much sparkle
" '' main yah nahin kahuungi ki aap bhalaa kii khubasurat lagi thim
 But there was something special in your work, there was something in your personality, which was full of enthusiasm and attractive
 anoushkah thank god, aapane bhi yah dekha
 Rani: How did you decide to become an actress? Anushka: i remember, you also heard someone asking you the question whether you were good at studies
 or aapane kaha tha ki haa thi
 You also said that to you
 
 
 raniah 
 
 
 It was very good to study
 anoushkah aapako number bhi achche milte the
 This is the second thing that is common to both of us
 vaise bachapan main meraa koi khaas sapana nahin tha
 Rani: But did you also feel the way i always felt - i did not know which path i would choose
 lekin itnaa jarur pataa tha ki main kaamyaab hona chaahati hum
 Anushka: And i could not explain this thing to anyone but i knew that i had to become something in life
 raniah haa, aap ekadam thik-thik nahin bataa sakate ki aap kya bananaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Anushka: He is an instinct, so i thought i would be a very successful person
 lekin kya, yah pataa nahin tha
 Once Adi asked me a strange question, "were you very good at studies?" Rani: (laughs) Anushka: So i don't be surprised when Adi asks questions because they can ask anything
 maine kaha, ''haa
 i used to come to the first or second position
 '' tab unhone kaha, ''acha
 
 
 That's why you are so good
 '' main sochane lagi ki ve kya kah rahe hai!raniah ki iskaa kya matlab he
 Anushka: Today i can understand what he meant
 main samajhati hum ki main hameshaa se kamyaabi paane vaali ladki thi
 If she had participated in a sport in school, she would have performed very well in it
 raniah ham apane skool main keval throbaal khelte the
 Anushka: i also wanted to be at the forefront if i participated in the competition of making collages
 to mujhe lagata he ki koi aisi cheez thi, jo mujhe drive kar rahi thi
 My mother also used to encourage me a lot
 mujhe lagata he ki meri maa ne hi pehali baar meri photo logon ke paas bheji thi
 Rani: My mother and your mother should meet each other
 anoushkah lambey vakt tak mujhe yahi nahin ehsaas hua ki main filmon main kaise aa gai
 Who sowed the seeds in my mind? Because i thought i would be a model
 mujhe lagata he ki vah bhi kahin na kahin meri maa kii vajah se hi mere man main aayaa tha
 Rani: Let me tell you a very funny thing
 meri nani bahut tej-tarraar mahila hai
 My mother started singing on stage with Mohammed Rafi at the age of 13
 meri maa ke parivaar ke sabhi log art field main rahe hai
 Someone is associated with Rabindranath Tagore's institute, my youngest aunt is an actress in Kolkata
 isliye jis din main paidaa hui, usee din se meri nani ne taiyaari shuru kar di ki ve mujhe abhinetri banaaengi
 i did not know this at all until becoming an actress
 ve meri maa se kaha karti thim, ''krishna tumhaari beti bahut sundar he
 We should make her an actress
 '' yah badi ajeeb baat he ki meri sari prerana hameshaa meri maa ke gharavaalon kii taraf se milti rahi he
 i started at the time when things were changing, the stars had fallen from the sky
 ve plastic ke chamakane vaale un sitaron kii tarah ho gaye the jinhen aap bachche ke bedroom kii chat main laga dete hai
 Film stars had become more comfortable, you can meet them very comfortably
 ve log aasmaan se nahin utre hai, balki hamaari tarah hi saamaanya log hai
 Anushka: So people could meet you and take your photo while leaving the house for exercise
 raniah yah pehle kii tarah nahin tha
 Today i think that the fans who used to write love letters to us have become like witnesses of hate letters
 soshal media par kalakaaron ko gaaliyaan di jaati hai
 Thankfully, i am left with them
 shaayad is vajah se ki bahut hi ekant main rahane vaale shaks se meri shaadi hui he
 Anushka: Which can be a myth
 raniah haa, ve ek myth ho sakate hai
 Anushka: You are your daughter, because of which people will think that there are other things in your life
 raniah (hansatii hai) ve mistar india nahin hai
 That is why i am not deliberately on social media because when you are on social media, you cannot make the choice that you only talk to your fans
 aapako un logon ko bhi jawaab dena padataa he jo aapako follow karte hai, aapke twit padhate hai yaa vahaan aapaki nijee baaten jaananaa chaahate hai
 Today i am married, i have a baby girl and i cannot stress my husband that he should not stay away from the media and can i post my photo with him
 chabison ghante apni tasviren dene main mujhe koi dikkat nahin kyonki main is field main hum or mujhe isaki aadat ho gai he
 But i suddenly cannot take responsibility that photos of my husband or my daughter are being published
 main aisa nahin kar sakati kyonki uske pita bhi uske bare main kuch faisle lete hai
 But i can understand how artists today have to face pressure because they are constantly monitored
 aaj aap kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate ki koi chappalein pahan kar flite main yun hi chadh jayega (log notice na lenge)
 Today there are stylists who take care of your dress even while going to the airport
 mujhe is par bahut hansi aati he
 Anushka: But you know how relieved i am
 Then i decided not to express my anger on this
 raniah kya aapaki stylist aapako bataati he ki aap airport par koun-sa bag le jaaen?anoushkah nahin, lekin kuch log meraa majaak udaate hai ki main ek hi tarah ke bag kyon le jaati hum yaa main ek hi tarah kii juutiyaan kyon pahenti hum
 The truth is that i do not pay attention to these things
 raniah nahin main bas samajhnaa chaahati hum
 Our houses in Mumbai are so small, where to keep so many bags and shoes
 pahan to sakate hai par rakhenge kahaan?anoushkah maine apni jindagi saadagi bhari bana lee he
 i wear black clothes
 raniah blike pahenti ho
 (laughs) Rani: But i always wonder what the hell is going on? At airport security, belt has to be removed
 anoushkah main afasaron se itnaa darati hum ki vah sab nahin kar sakati
 Rani: i have heard of some artists who went into depression due to social media
 kyonki unke bare main jo kuch likhaa jaataa he, use ve bahut gambhirtha se lete hai or unhen sach maanane lagate hai
 Anushka: It is possible
 maine apane bare main nakaaratmak baaten padhpsi shuru kin to mujhe bhi samajhane main vakt laga ki uskaa kya matlab he
 Rani: But how good was it in my time that nobody used to waste money on buying postal stamps for abusing me? is kaarobaari hafte ke pehle din laal nishaan ke neeche band hone ke baad share bazaar ne mangalvaar ko badhat ke saath shuruyaat kii

 India defeated Great Britain 2–1 after a long time to make it to the semi-finals of the World Hockey League Finals tournament
 match se pehle jaankaar or aankade zarur is mukaable main england kaa palada baari maan rahe the, lekin team hockey india ne ise galat sabit kar diya
 This is India's first win in the tournament, but in a very important match, number 6 in the world rankings, India defeated the number-4 team 2-1 in the world ranking, it showed that it still had a lot and its game was not over
 is
 kamaal kii baat yah he ki bharat, donon tiimon ke bich hue pichley match main england se (world hockey lig semifinal, entwarp main) 1-5 se haara tha or toornament main chauthe number par rahaa tha
 England coach Bob Crutchley also said before the match, "he (india) showed a good game against Germany
 haalanki, holland or argentina ke kilaaf ye team acha khel nahin dikhaa pai, lekin ye team quarter final main apana str yakeenan acha karegi or kadaa muqabla khelegi
 "comments bhartiya team ne ye kar dikhaaya
 India avenged many defeats against Great Britain, that too in an ego tournament and with great style
 viaar raghunatha (19wein minute main) or talvinder singh (39wein minute main) ke golon ne bharat ko ek badi jeet dilaa di
 Simon Mantel scored the only goal from Great Britain in the 52nd minute
 golon kaa ye antar akhir tak bana rahaa
 One special thing is that in the first three quarters of this match, Indian players impressed everyone by playing Total Hockey
 in khilaadiyon ne kuch maukey zarur ganvaaye
 One worry seems to be putting pressure on himself in the last moments that needs to be worked on, but if coach Rolant Oltmans' team continues to play like this, then the recurring breath of Indian hockey can get strength
 toornament main ye bharat kii pehali jeet he, lekin ek behad aham mukaable main world ranking main nambar-6 bharat ne world ranking main nambar-4 team ko 2-1 se haraakar dikhaa diya ki usamen abhi bahut dam he or uskaa khel khatm nahin hua he
 The amazing thing is that India lost to England (in World Hockey League semi-finals, Antwerp) 1–5 in the last match between the two teams and finished fourth in the tournament
 england ke coach bob krachali ne match se pehle kaha bhi tha, "unhone (bharat ne) germany ke khilaaf acha khel dikhaaya
 Although this team could not play well against Holland and Argentina, but this team will definitely do well in the quarter-finals and play a tough match
 "tippaniyan The Indian team did this
 bharat ne great britain ke khilaaf kai haar kaa badla le liya, wo bhi ek aham toornament main or bade hi style se
 Goals from VR Raghunath (19th minute) and Talwinder Singh (39th minute) gave India a big win
 great britain kii ore se iklauta gol simon mantel ne 52wein minute main kiya
 This gap of the balls remained till the end
 ek khaas baat ye bhi he ki is match ke pehle teen quarter main bhartiya khilaadiyon ne total hockey khelkar sabko prabhavit kiya
 These players missed some opportunities
 ek phikr kii baat aakhri lamhon main khud par dabaav banane kii dikhi jisapar kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin agar coach rolant aultmans kii team aisa hi khelti rahi to bhartiya hockey kii baar-baar tuutati saanson ko dam mil saktaa he
