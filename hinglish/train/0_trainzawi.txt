 com / k21ikvozvg After the Pune Test victory, the Australian team will enter the Bangalore Test starting on Saturday with strong morale
 pune main kangaroo team ne ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon hi kshetron main behtareen pradarshan karte hue bharat ko na keval usee ke maidan par shikast di balki lagaataar 19 match se aparaajey rahane ke kram ko bhi tod diya
 a lot of the batting of the visiting team is on captain Steve Smith and left-handed opener David Warner
 smith ne bhartiya viketon par rukne kii kshamta dikhaate hue pune test main shatak jamaaya
 Thanks to this struggling innings, he has tried to convey to his batsmen that on the strength of strong will, runs can also be scored on Indian wickets which are considered helpful of spin balls
 maje kii baat yah he ki smith ne apana kariyar leg spinner ke taur par prarambh kiya tha or ve aathven number par ballebaaji ke liye utarate the
 Later, he improved his batting and not only made it to the Australian team as a specialist batsman but also became its captain
 tippaniyan The Australian captain can name another record in the Bengaluru Test
 chinnaswami stadium main agar smith 112 ran banane main kaamyaab rahe to test cricket main 5000 ran ke aankade ko chhu lenge
 Looking at the manner in which Smith is batting, it seems that he will touch this figure in the Bengaluru test itself
 bhartiya team kii koshish hogi ki vah smith ko jald out kar na sirf australian team par dabaav banaae balki bengaluru main unhen yah record banane se vanchit kare
 For this, the players of Team India will have to overcome their weakness to drop the catch
 pune main bhartiya fielderon ne smith ko teen jeevandaan die
 Once Murali Vijay and twice substitute Abhinav Mukund missed the Australian team captain
 australia ke purv captain maaikel clark ne bhi kaha he ki yadi bhartiya fielderon ne phir se kaich drop kiye to smith shatak banaakar team india kii mushkilon main ijapha kar sakate hai
 Anyway, Smith's record against the Indian team has been excellent
 ab tak 51 test khel chuke smith ne 60
 He has scored 4888 runs at an impressive average of 34 which includes 18 centuries
 is dauraan 215 ran australian captain kaa sarvocch score rahaa he
 Apart from Test matches, Smith is also successful in odis
 ve 95 vanade maichon main 43
 Has scored 3101 runs at an average of 67 which includes eight centuries
 bengaluru test main australian captain ek or record apane naam kar sakate hai
 If Smith managed to score 112 runs at the Chinaswamy Stadium, then the Test would touch 5000 runs in cricket
 smith jis andaaj main batting kar rahe hai, use dekhte hue aisa lag rahaa he ki bengaluru test main hi ve is aankade ko chhu lenge
 The Indian team will try to get Smith out early and not only put pressure on the Australian team but also deprive him of this record in Bengaluru
 iske liye team india ke khilaadiyon ko kaich drop karne kii apane kamajori ko dur karnaa hoga
 Smith gave three lives to Indian fielders in Pune
 ek baar murali vijay or do baar sthanapann khilaadi abhinav mukund ne australia team ke captain kaa kaich choda
 Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has also said that if Indian fielders drop catches again, Smith can add to Team India's woes by scoring a century
 vaise bhi smith kaa bhartiya team ke khilaaf record shandaar rahaa he
 Smith has played 60 of the 51 Tests so far
 34 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se 4888 ran banaae hai jisamen 18 shatak shaamil hai
 During this period, 215 runs have been the highest score by the Australian captain
 test maichon ke alaava vanade main bhi smith kaamyaab hai
 He 43 in 95 odis
 67 ke ausat se 3101 ran bana chuke hai jisamen aath shatak shaamil hai
 Anyway, Smith's record against the Indian team has been excellent
 ab tak 51 test khel chuke smith ne 60

 Talking about the female friend, Alka said that my girlfriend asked me if i knew this BJP MP? He showed me the original SMS from a number on my mobile and when i dialed that number on my mobile it was the number of a BJP MP from Delhi
 maine mahila mitra ko police main shikaayat karne ke liye kaha to uskaa jawaab tha ki jab aapako nyaay nahin mil rahaa, to ham to keval badnaam hokar rah jaaenge
 Alka Lamba, while questioning the police action during the conversation, said that it is very surprising when we are celebrating Women's Day on 8 March and talking about their honor

 Questions were being raised about Ricky Ponting's place in the Australian team but he gave a befitting reply to the critics by hitting a half-century in both innings of the first Test match against India, although the former captain is disappointed for not turning him into a century
 ponting ne do pariyon main 62 or 60 ran banaaye
 After the third day's play ended, he said, "it looks good to score a few runs but when you go beyond 50 runs, being a top-order batsman, it becomes your job to score big
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main niraash hum ki main donon pariyon main aisa nahin kar paaya

 jab main out hua to hamane do wicket or ganvaa diye

 ’ gendbaajon ke is din main bharat ne apane aakhri saat wicket 68 ran ke andar ganvaaye jabaki austrailia ne aath wicket par 179 ran banaaye hai
 He praised his fast bowlers strongly
 ponting ne kaha, ‘austrailia ne duusare din kii tulana main tisare din behatar line or length se gendbaaji kii
 We bowled very well this morning
 chauthe din yadi ham nayi gend se phir se isi tarah kii shuruyaat karte hai to phir se hamaare liye mauka ban jayega
 'this former captain does not believe that criticism in the media encouraged him to do well in this Test match
 unhone kaha, ‘main is baat kii parvaah nahin karata ki dressing room ke baahar log kya kah rahe hai
 If i feel that i am getting some support within the dressing room then that really means a lot to me
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mere liye prerana kii kami nahin thi lekin mere liye ek safal team kaa safal khilaadi hona zyada mahatvapurn he
 For the last few months, when everything was not going according to me, i got immense support from the people

 Input: IANS input: IANS Taking the inmates of the prison to the hospital for treatment and bringing them in is a huge responsibility as there is a clash between the inmates and the policemen during that time and sometimes the accused manage to escape
 haal hi main ghotaale ke aarope main giraftaar vidhayak ramesh kadam kaa police ke saath badasluki kaa video bhi viral hua tha
 But now to avoid this problem, Arthur Road Jail Administration has introduced telemedicine
 telemedicine yani video conferencing ke jariye jeje aspataal ke bade doctoron se consalt kar unka ilaaj jail main hi karnaa
 Harshad Ahirarao, Superintendent of Arthur Road Jail, said that the jail has OPD and also doctors, but inmates have to be taken to JJ Hospital for treatment of serious illnesses
 rojaanaa 35 ke kareeb kaidi gambhir beemaari kaa hawala dekar jeje aspataal main le jane ke liye dabaav daalate hai
 This increases the pressure on the police to carry and bring them, the danger of prisoners escaping and coming in contact with their outsiders is different
 isaliye is telemedicine yojana ke tahat jail main hi unka ilaaj karne kii shuruyaat hui he or isamen safalataa bhi mil rahi he
 The comments haalanki sonography or emarai jaise test ke liye aropiyon ko aspataal le janaa ab bhi jari he
 But earlier, where about 35 prisoners had to be taken to the hospital every day, now that number has come down to 15
 isse police par dabaav bhi kam hua he or kaidiyon kaa ilaaj bhi behatar ho paa rahaa he
 Jail ADG b k Upadhyay said that the scheme has been started on a pilot basis in Arthur Road Jail and Yerwada Jail in Pune
 lekin isaki safalataa ko dekhte hue jald hi ise rajya kii duusari jelon main bhi lagu kiya jayega
 Telemedicine means videoconferencing, consulting the big doctors of JJ Hospital and treating them in jail
 arthur road jail ke adheekshak harshad ahirrav ne bataaya ki jail main opidi he or doctor bhi hai, lekin gambhir bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye kaidiyon ko je je aspataal le janaa padataa he
 Around 35 prisoners daily pressurize him to take JJ to the hospital citing serious illness
 isse police par inhen le jane or laane kaa dabaav to badhata hi he, kaidiyon ke bhaagane or unke bahari logon ke sampark main aane kaa khatra rahata he wo alag
 That is why under this telemedicine scheme, treatment has started in the jail itself and it is also getting success
 tippaniyan However, taking the accused to hospital for tests like sonography and MRI is still continuing
 lekin pehle jahaan rojaanaa 35 ke kareeb kaidiyon ko aspataal le janaa padataa tha ab wo sankhya ghatakar 15 ke kareeb ho gai he
 This has also reduced the pressure on the police and the treatment of prisoners is also getting better

 But in view of its success, it will soon be implemented in other jails of the state

 Buoyed by a landslide victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, the BJP formulated its expansion strategy at a two-day national executive meeting in Bhubaneswar on April 15-16, 2017
 tay kiya gaya ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhaajapa un rajyon par focus karegi jahaan par party kaa janaadhar kamjor he
 117 such parliamentary seats were identified and targeted to win
 kerala kii 20 siten bhi inhen 117 siton main shaamil hai
 BJP General Secretary Arun Singh says, "it was decided in the Odisha Executive to deploy party workers in states where the party is less strong
 15 dinon ke liye 3,68,000 kaaryakartaaon ko in rajyon main tainaat kiya gaya
 Then, 4,000 workers were deployed for six months to one year
 '' sutron ke mutabik, in kaaryakartaaon main 680 kaaryakarta kerala bheje gaye
 The next day after the meeting, Amit Shah prepared a blueprint for "mission Kerala"
 mishan kerala ke tahat yah tay kiya gaya ki agaami shivaratri (13 farvari, 2018) ko ayodhya se rameswaram tak 41 dinon kii ramraj rathyatra kii shuru kii jaaegi
 The 6,000 km journey traveled through 6 states — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, covering 224 Lok Sabha seats
 rameswaram main yatra purna hone se pehle bhaajapa, aresas or vishwa hindu parishad ke logon ne tiruvanantpuram main yatra kaa bhavy swaagat kiya
 According to sources, the BJP was assuming that the Kerala government would try to stop the yatra and then the BJP would get the issue but if it did not, then the plan was shelved
 lekin party uchit maukey kii talash main dati rahi
 The BJP and its parent organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), finally got an opportunity on 28 September, which gave them an orthodox tool to create another "ayodhya" in Kerala
 supreme court ne 28 sitambar ko sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh kii anumati de di
 When the Left Front government of Kerala announced the implementation of the order of the Supreme Court, the BJP and the RSS and the affiliates of the Sangh went into protest
 faisla aane ke baad chaar hakrate tak sangh parivaar or bhaajapa ke netaa supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf to kuch nahin bole lekin aasthaa kaa vaasta dekar yah kehete rahe ki sabarimala mandir main sabhi aayu varg kii mahilaon kaa pravesh nahin hone denge
 Despite this, Sabarimala could not get the political sharpening like Ram temple of Ayodhya
 pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh shridharan pillai kaa kahana he, "ham supreme court ke faisle ko maanate hai lekin yah mudda kanoon kaa nahin, balki aasthaa kaa he
 When asked why the central government was not bringing an ordinance against the court's decision, he said, "the central leadership will decide the strategy going forward
 ham to abhi pradesh kii vam morcha sarkaar se maang kar rahe hai ki rajya sarkaar khud hi adhyadesh laae jaisaa ki jalikattu ko lekar tamilnadu sarkaar adhyadesh lekar ai thi
 The BJP continued on a two-step forward and one step backward strategy until Amit Shah himself turned to Kerala
 kunoor main 27 aktubar ko amit shah ne sabarimala prakaran ko vah painaapan dene kii koshish ki jisase aasthaa ke naam par na sirf kerala balki aasapaas ke rajyon ke hindu votaron ko bhaajapa ke paksh main kiya ja sake
 In Coonoor, Amit Shah said, “the people of Kerala should support the BJP to protect the great religion, culture, faith and traditions of the country
 ''shah yaheen nahin ruke
 He even went so far as to target polarization of Hindu votes on the issue of faith, stating that “kerala Chief Minister P

 When Vijayan cannot do this then why are he persecuting the devotees of Lord Ayyappa
 '' shah yah kehane se bhi nahin chuke ki court ke kai faisle aise hai jin par aaj tak amal nahin hua he, phir bhagwaan ayappa ke bhakton par atyaachaar kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 Shah also paid tribute to the Sangh and BJP workers who have been murdered in Kerala in the last few years
 baaki partiyaan bhaajapa kii is ranneeti ko nahin samaj paa rahi hai, aisa nahin he
 M

 aam aadmi party ke andar kii kalah or bavaal rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Now the situation is that the smoldering spark is coming out in the party
 aam aadmi party netaa kumaar vishwaas or dilip pandeya ke bich soshal media par takaraar dikhaai de rahi he
 Former Delhi in-charge Dilip Pandey questioned Kumar Vishwas
 pandeya ne twitor par likhaa, "bhaiya, aap congressiyon ko khub gaali dete ho, par kehete ho ki rajasthan main vasundhara ke khilaaf nahin bolenge? aisa kyon?"darasal, kumaar vishwaas ne 10 june ko rajasthan unit ke padaadhikariyon ke saath baithak kii thi
 In the meeting, Kumar had said that the party will return to its core principles in the Rajasthan assembly elections
 kumaar ne apane padaadhikariyon se bijepi netaa or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje samet kisi netaa par nijee tippaniyan nahin karne ke nirdesh die the
 Kumar had instructed his leaders to campaign focused on issues rather than personal comments
 bijepi netaaon ke prati kumaar ke is naram rukh par dilip pandeya ne sawaal khadey kar die
 Dilip Pandey said in a conversation with Aaj Tak after tweet that Kumar Vishwas is a pioneer
 aam aadmi party bijepi or congress ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bolti ai he
 But giving the message of Kumar Vishwas that the BJP is not to speak against the leaders, creates doubts among the workers
 pandeya ne kaha ki kumaar vishwaas se koi matbhed or manmutav nahin or na hi un par koi aarope he
 This is just the dilemma among the workers, which should overcome Kumar Vishwas
 pandeya ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki bijepi khele to cricket, congress khele to gulli danda, aisa nahin chalegaa
 It is clear from Pandey's statement that everything is not going well inside the Aam Aadmi Party regarding Kumar Vishwas
 isse pehle amanatulla khan ne kumaar vishwaas par gambhir aarope lagaae the, jiske baad unhen party se suspend bhi kiya gaya
 In such a situation, it is now clear to raise the question of Dilip Pandey that there is a tremendous camp in the party
 amanatulla khan vivaad ke baad hikumar vishwasako aam aadmi party ne rajasthan kaa prabharee niyukt kiya tha or haal hi main hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main bhi rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke sanket die the
 After which Kumar Vishwas became active about the Rajasthan assembly elections
 vishwaas ne dilli main rajasthan ke sabhi padaadhikariyon kii baithak bulaai thi jisamen do took shabdon main yah kaha tha ki rajasthan main kisi bhi bade netaa kii tasviir nahin lagaai jaaegi
 The gesture was clear that even the picture of Arvind Kejriwal in Rajasthan would not be used
 itnaa hi nahin vishwaas nerajasthan main party unitako mul siddhanton par lautne kii baat kahi thi
 Which clearly indicated the leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party
 vishwaas ne netaaon ko naseehat di thi kisi bhi netaa chaahe vah vasundhara raaje hi kyon na ho, unke khilaaf nijee tippanee nahin kii jaaegi
 Kumar also said not to do face-centered politics
 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main abhi lagbhag dedh saal kaa samay baaki he
 Even before that, there has been an open debate in 'AAP'
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya aam aadmi party ko kumaar par "vishwaas" nahin he? Former England captain Paul Collingwood has described the England team as a strong contender to win the T20 World Cup
 collingwood ne kaha ki maujuuda vakt main englad kii ballebaaji behtareen he or yahi team ke liye achche sanket hai
 England's batting line-up has batsmen like Eoin Morgan, Ben Stokes, Jose Butler, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Sam Billing, Jason Roy and James Vince and so does coach Trevor Bellis, who believes his team will start in India this week
 Rhee can come out as the winner in the World Cup
 team kii fielding shandarcollingwood ne kaha ki 'aise khilaadiyon ke saath ek team ke bade aayojanon main jeet hasil karne kii ummid rahati he
 Your batting is strong till 9th or 10th and your fielding is excellent
 ye baaten kisi bhi team ko majbootee pradaan karti hai
 Collingwood Collingwood will be with his team as batting consultant in the World Cup, which starts formally from 15 March

 Pakistan is out of the ICC cricket tournament
 tisare quarter final match main australia ne pakistan ko 6 wicket se haraakar use toornament se baahar kar diya
 In the matches held on Friday, Pakistan rarely face defeat
 world cap main ye paanchvaan mauka tha, jab pakistan ne shuukravaar ko match khelaa or 1987 ke baad duusari baar use is din khele gaye match main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In the World Cup, Friday's 'fear' of PAK is a day of foul play and it has always been difficult to defeat Pakistan on this day
 records bhi isaki gavaahi dete hai
 Talking about the World Cup, Pakistan has played 71 World Cup matches so far, of which 40 have been won and 29 have been lost, while two matches did not result
 is dauraan paanch baar aisa hua he ki match shuukravaar ko hua
 Out of these five, Pakistan lost only twice
 shuukravaar ko pehali baar world cap main pakistan 1987 main khelaa tha
 In this match played against West Indies on 16 October, Pakistan had won an exciting 1-wicket win
 pakistan ne ye match haarate haarate jeeta tha
 At that time it was difficult for any team to defeat the West Indies
 iske baad haalanki westeindies ne kuch din baad hi pakistan ko shuukravaar ke din hi haraaya tha
 It was the only occasion before this match when Pakistan lost in the World Cup on Friday
 iske baad 1999 world cap main pakistan ne do match shuukravaar ko khele or donon hi jite
 On 28 May, Pakistan defeated New Zealand by 62 runs and then Zimbabwe by 148 runs

 naam aate hi unke khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 His son was admitted to Kanpur Cardiology on the instructions of the Lucknow CM office

 Therefore, on the instructions of CM Yogi's office, the child has been admitted to Kanpur as the first patient of Ayushman Bharat Yojana
 gorakhpur ke langadi gulriya ke rahane vaale ramamilan painting mazdooree karte hai
 The seven-year-old Ramamillan had a hole in his heart
 ramamilan ne apane bachche ko sanjay gandhi pijiai lakhanu main dikhaaya
 Apart from this, he showed up in many other hospitals, where the cost of treatment of the child was reported to be around three to four lakhs

 Where directives came from the CM office for the treatment of his son Rohan under the Ayushman scheme

 isse pehle 9 octubar ko nitish kataara hatyakand main supreme court ne purv saansad deepi yadav ke bete vikaas yadav or bhaanje vishaal yadav ko maut kii sajaa dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that this case is only of murder and not of heinous crime
 supreme court ne ye bhi kaha ki is maamle main taumr jail main rakhane kii bhi sajaa nahin di ja sakati
 In the case, Nitish's mother Neelam Katara demanded the Supreme Court to extend the sentence
 neelam kataara kii taraf se pesh varisht vakil harish salve ne kaha tha ki ye purvaniyojit hatya thi, donon hi padhe-likhe the
 At the same time, the accused also knew their crime well
 pehle nitish kaa apharan kiya gaya, uske baad hathaudaa markar uski hatya kii or phir jala diya gaya, isliye ye jaghanyatam aparaadh tha
 Comments: On this argument of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court had said that it does not appear that there was honor killing in this case
 vishaal kii bahan bharti yadav apni bahan kii shaadi kaa card bhi nitish ke ghar dene gayi thi, jiskaa matlab donon parivaar ek duusare ko jaanate the
 The court also said that the reason for the murder was the conspiracy between the two to dance together during the marriage and the murder of the two brothers from it, but this murder was not a heinous crime
 ' Apart from denying capital punishment, the court had also said that 'both brothers were very young at the time of murder, so even Taumra cannot be punished
 ' dilli hoicourt ne vikaas or vishaal yadav ko 30 saal kii kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Both have also challenged the High Court's decision in the Supreme Court

 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne bihar main sattashin rajg gathbandhan par ‘bihar shining’ ke jhuthe prachaar karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki pradesh ke vikaas ke liye centre ne karodon rupee is rajya ko die par yahaan kaam jameen par nahin dikhataa
 Rahul, who came here to campaign in favor of Congress candidates during the assembly elections in the state, said that at present there is UPA government in the center, when his party contested in 2004, he promised the people of the country that at the center If a Congress and UPA government is formed, then it will be a government for the common man, the poor, the backward, the Dalits and the tribals
 unhone pashchimi champaran jile ke ramnagar or gopalganj ke kuchayakot main bhi jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Rahul Gandhi said that the NDA contested against the Congress in the year 2004 and at that time gave the slogan 'india Shining i
e
 Shining Hindustan' and at that time it meant that India was shining but in the said election the people of the country He told them that the Hindustan of farmers, backward, Dalits and tribals is not shining and they showed him the way out
 unhone kaha ki centre kii pichhali rajg sarkaar ke logon ne janata ke bich na jaakar unki sthiti ko dekhe bina or unki baat sune bina apane-apane gharon main baithe hue ukt naaraa de daalaa
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi said that in the 2009 elections too, Congress had talked about forming the government of the common man at the Center
 congress ne ukt chunaav ke dauraan garibi, pichhadepan, dalit evam adivaasiyon kaa mudda uthaaya par rajg ne in sabko chhod aatankwaad sahit anya muddon kii baat kii
 Rahul said that the people of the country again showed to the NDA in 2009 that we need a government that can think about the common man, the poor and the backward and can take the country on the path of progress and take everyone along
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki varsh 2004 main centre main congress ne satta main aane par duniya kaa sabase bada rojgaar kaa kaarykram naregaa jo aajkal manaregaa ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kii shuruuaat kii or uske tahat garibon berozegaron ko sau din ke rojgaar kii guarantee kii vyavastha kii gayi he
 He said that apart from the loan waiver of 60 thousand crore rupees, the bank's doors were opened again for the farmers
 rahul ne kaha ki centre kii pichhali congress sarkaar ne adivaasiyon ko unki jameen waapas dilaai tathaa iske atirikt shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon ko paas karaayaa or aane vaale samay main bhojan ke adhikaar kii baat kar rahi he
 He said that when the Congress was in power at the center in 2004, there was progress in the country and India started moving forward very fast
 raashi kii kami nahin hone kii baat karte hue rahul ne kaha ki aaj kisi bhi pradesh ko jitani bhi raashi kii jarurat ho, centre sarkaar bhej sakati he
 Giving examples, Rahul said that during the tenure of the previous NDA government at the center, Rs 50 thousand crore was given to Bihar, but the previous UPA government at the center gave Rs 1 lakh crore to this state during its five-year term, but sadly It is that the said amount did not reach the public
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki agar centre kii indira awaas yojana kii baat karen to iske tahat sabase adhik raashi bihar ko mili par usamen bhi bhrashtachar vyaapt he or vah garibon ko nahin milakar amiron ko diya ja rahaa he
 He said that if we talk about employment under MGNREGA in Bihar, poor people would not get even 30 days of employment under this, even if they get 100 days of employment
 rahul ne kaha ki bihar main agar vidyutikaran kii baat kii jaae to hajaaron aise gaanv hai jahaan aaj bijli nahin he, jabaki iske liye centre ne pradesh sarkaar ko raashi de rakhi he or kendriya gramin vidyutikaran yojana ke tahat har gaanv main bijli pahunchaai jaani he
 He said that seeing the time of elections, the present NDA government of the state is once again talking of 'bihar Shining' and if this is the case then why are the people in the state craving for electricity and water and the people of Bihar for jobs in Mumbai, Why are you bound to go to other parts of the country including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi
 rahul ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par bhaajapa or rajg ke anya ghatak dalon kii vichaardhaara ke saath chalane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ve aisa logon ko digbhramit karne ke liye kar rahe hai
 He said that while Nitish talks about not allowing BJP leader Narendra Modi and others to come to Bihar when the election time comes, his ally Shiv Sena chief Bala Saheb Thackeray drives the Biharis out of Maharashtra
 rahul ne kaha ki jab gujarat main danga hua to nitish ne uskaa virodh karte hue kendriya mantri ke pad se istipha kyon nahin diya
 Appealing to the people to vote for the Congress for the development of Bihar and to bring all sections of the society together, Rahul said that his party never compromised with the ideologies that threatened the integrity of the country

 The Maharashtra Legislature's Loklakha Committee's proposal to stop female feticide has created a new ruckus
 samiti ko lagata he ki ling pareekshan anivaary kiya jaae, taaki ladkiyaan bachaain ja saken
 While raising the declining birth rate of women as compared to men, the Lok Sabha Committee of Maharashtra Legislature has expressed concern that parents should make sex testing of the womb mandatory when sonography is released
 garbh agar ladki kaa ho to parivaar kii nigaraanee kii jaae taaki, ladki kii paidaaish parivaar ke liye anivaary ho
 The debate in the Maharashtra Legislature has been cited for this suggestion in the report of the Loklekha Committee
 samiti ke pramukh gopaldaas agarwal ne kaha he ki maujuuda pisipindity kanoon, jo ki 1994 main bana he, stri bhrun hatya rokane ke liye kargar sabit nahin ho rahaa he
 In this case, a change has been offered
 samiti kaa kahana he ki, janaganana ke aankadon ke anusaar, maharashtra main 2001 se 2011tak ladakon ke muqaabale ladakiyon kaa anupaat kam rahaa he
 Meanwhile, in several incidents, 550 cases have been registered exposing the female feticide racket and registration of 48 doctors has been canceled
 lekin, in ghatnaon main parivaar garbh sangrakshan kii jimmedaari se mukt hai, unhen kanoon ke daayre main laane kii pahal loklekha samiti ne kii he
 The comments saarvajanik swasthya ke kshetra main kaam karne vaali varsha deshpandey ne loklekha samiti ke suzav ko avyavhaarik qaraar dete hue mahilaon kii niztaa se chhedchhad qaraar diya he

 Committee head Gopaldas Agarwal has said that the current PCPNDT Act, which was enacted in 1994, is not proving effective to stop female feticide
 aise main usamen badlaav kii peshkash kii gai he
 The committee states that, according to census data, the proportion of girls to boys has remained low in Maharashtra from 2001 to 2011

 But, in these incidents, the families are free from the responsibility of protection of the womb, the Loklekha Committee has taken the initiative to bring them within the purview of the law
 tippaniyan Varsha Deshpande, who works in the field of public health, has termed the suggestion of the Loklekha Committee as impractical, trolling the privacy of women

 kendriya grih sachiv ji ke pillai ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki jammu-kashmir main tainaat surakshabalon kii sankhya main 25 fisadi tak katautee kii jaaegi
 Pillai said, "the government is planning to cut the number of security forces deployed in Jammu and Kashmir by 25 percent
 ’unhone kaha ki hamane srinagar main surakshabalon kii sankhya pehle hi kam kar di he kyonki aabaadi vaale kshetron main surakshabal kam se kam sankhya main hone chahie
 The local police should only deal with the situation
 vishwaas behaal karne ke upaay ke taur par hamane yah kadam uthaaya he
 We want all forces to be deployed only at the borders so that infiltration can be stopped
 unhone kaha ki srinagar se or bunker hathaaye jaaenge
 It is worth mentioning that Pillai had indicated a few days ago that the number of security forces will be reduced in the areas of Jammu and Kashmir where long-term peace prevails
 pillai ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar dwaara niyukt vaartakaron se kaha gaya he ki ve raajnneetik samaadhaan ko lekar apane antim prastaav april tak sarkaar ko saunp den
 The Home Secretary was attending the seminar 'they Forward in Kashmir' organized by Jamia Millia Islamia University
 kashmir samasya kaa samaadhaan sujhane ke liye sarkaar ne patrkaar dilip padaganvkar, shikshavid radha kumaar or purv mukhya soochna ayukta em em ansaari ko vaartakar niyukt kiya tha
 Pillai said that we have allowed people of Kashmir and Pakistan occupied Kashmir to meet for 15 days

 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke naunve or antim charan ke liye prachaar kaa kaam shanivaar ko khatm ho gaya or iske turant baad bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat samet sheersh aresas netaaon se mulaakaat kii
 Just a day after this, BJP President Rajnath Singh also attended Delhi Union Headquarters
 dilli ke sangh daftar main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh or aresas netaaon ke bich yah baithak kareeb do ghante tak chali
 It is believed that Rajnath discussed with him the strategy after the election
 mana ja rahaa he ki rajnath singh antim charan ke matdaan ke maddenjar party kii ranneeti or 16 may ko matganana ke vishay main bhi charchaa kii
 Bhaiyyaji Joshi and Suresh Soni were also present, Anurag Thakur was also present with Rajnath Singh's union leaders Bhaiyyaji Joshi and Suresh Soni in this meeting which lasted for about 2 hours
 sutron ne bataaya ki jhandevalaan sthit aresas karyaalay main teenon netaaon kii baithak hui or chunaav ke baad kii sthiti par charchaa kii
 Later, the Sangh informed that in this meeting the Sangh leaders were thanked for their support in campaigning
 dattatreya hoshaable ne kaha, ‘modi ne apane chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke anubhavon ko bataane aae the
 Rajnath also came in the same way
 ’sangh pramukh se mili the modibijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne shanivaar ko chunaav prachaar samaapt hone ke baad sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat kii thi
 Modi, who is campaigning in Uttar Pradesh, met former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after returning to Delhi after the end of the nine-phase campaign
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne shanivaar ko twit kiya tha, ‘chunaav prachaar main antim raily ko sambodhit karne ke baad atalji kaa aashirwad liya
 Went to meet him even before starting the campaign
 unase mulaakaat hameshaa se vishesh rahaa he
 'it is worth mentioning that under the last phase, voting is to be held on Monday, including the Varanasi seat from where Modi is contesting elections
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki rajnath singh sangh pramukh kii gairmaujuudagi main dhanyavad dene pahunche
 This is a policy statement of politics but speculation is being made on something else
 jab bhi sansad kaa satr shuru hota he jiesti kii baat jor jor se hone lagati he
 If presented now, then it will pass
 jiesti ke bare main sunate padhate yahi laga ki yah bharat kii kar pranali kii sabhi samasyaon kaa ekamusth samaadhaan he
 Goods and service tax speak
 ise ab tak sabase bada kar sudhaar bataa kar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 If this is the case, then the scope of talk about GST should also be wider
 sarkaar ke daavon se lagata he ki wo ise paas karaane ke liye zarur sahmati or sankhya ke behad kareeb pahunch chuki he or ab ise kanoon banane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Sure it is a complicated subject but what is wrong with trying it
 vaise bhi vitt mantri kehete hai ki jiesti se desh kaa aarthik ekikaran hone vaala he, ab itani badi gatividhi ho rahi he to desh ko bhi charchaa kerani chahie
 Right now, the Center and the state together impose many types of taxes on any goods originating in India
 jaise cells tex, excise, chungi, waite vagairah
 You call these indirect taxes
 jahaan maal paidaa hua vahaan tex, jahaan se bikne yaa banane gaya to raste bhar main naanaa prakaar kii chungi or aapane kharida to phir tex
 For businessmen, many departments and papers had to face the hassle
 kai jagahon ke bijness dub jate the or kai jagahon ke chal padate the
 Such as State Government 14 on Machine and Machinery Part in Ghaziabad
 5 pratishat tex lagaati he
 Some nearby states levy a tax of five to seven percent on this item
 jisase gajiabad main iskaa dhandha kamazor ho jaataa he kyonki log is kaam ke liye duusare rajyon main chale jate hai
 Now we do not know that if the tax is levied at one rate in every place, then the business of machinery will shine everywhere or at one or two places only
 jiesti lagu hoga to ek hi baar or ek hi jagah tex dena hoga
 Earlier, VAT and service tax had come, even then many dreams were shown about them
 lekin ab sabko milakar ek jiesti aa rahaa he to sapane bhi ek ho gaye hai
 Tax levies will increase and India's GDP will also increase from decimal nine to one and a half to two percent
 jidipi badhane ke peeche daleel yah di jaati he ki is vakt asankhya kaarobaar kaa koi record nahin he, lihaaza jidipi kaa sahi aankalan nahin ho paata he
 GST experts say that whatever services they provide, whether they are traders or industrialists, if their annual turnover is more than one million, then they will have to file returns
 isse sarkaar ke paas zyada se zyada vaastavik aankada aayega or karon kii vasuuli bhi bad jaaegi
 But the GST that is coming in is really a rate and a type of tax system
 kya vaaki jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad sabhi jagah samaan kar lagu honge
 If so, what are these three different names in its list? centre jiesti, state jiesti, inter state jiesti
 The Finance Minister has called it economic integration, so why are there three types of GST
 ek prakaar kii kyon nahin he
 Critics say that due to the three types of GST, now the merchant's assessment will also be seen in three places
 jaise pehle chal rahaa tha vaise hi ab bhi chalegaa
 Critics say that a single return has to be filed but it will be examined by at least two or three officials at the central or state level
 kahin vyavastha vahi to nahin rahegi
 Is it really liberating to visit the departments? sona, chaandi or vilasita par jiesti alag hogi
 GST will be different on things related to general public
 agar rate kaa jhanjhat jiesti main rahegaa to phir jiesti kaa kya phayda
 Most of the articles and statements in the newspapers are praised by GST
 unka kahana he ki jiesti antim rup se to behatar he
 In a mature economy, there should be a record of all types of business
 kya bharat ke zyaadaatar log iske liye taiyaar hai
 If it took so many years to convince only the political parties, people would have to give time
 record se baahar vyapaar kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 GST is applicable in more than 160 countries of the world
 america main nahin lagu he
 Arun Kumar has raised some questions in the Economic and Political Weekly
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki ji es tii ke kaaran hamaari jidipi main apratyaksh karon kaa hissaa bad jayega
 If inflation increases due to indirect tax increase, then how will the prices of things come down
 arun kumaar kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar chizon ke daam badhenge
 What impact will GST have on the unorganized sector? kya vaaki isse hamaari arthvyavastha main chhipe kaale dhan ko kam yaa samaapt kiya ja sakegaa
 Is GST really the drug of every merge? professor prabhaat patnayak ne jiesti ko lekar sangheey dhaanche ke kamazor padane kii ashanka zaahir kii he
 Understand the meaning of federal structure, that the center and states will make their economic decisions according to their needs
 jiesti ke baad rajyon ke liye tex ko lekar kuch karne ke liye nahin bachegaa
 They will depend on the center for everything
 lekin vitt mantri kaa daawa he ki zyaadaatar rajya jiesti ke liye sahamat ho gaye hai
 Only Tamil Nadu has some objections
 tippaniyan The Monsoon Session of Parliament may become historic due to GST
 samvidhan sanshodhan bill he
 After passing the Rajya Sabha, half of the states will have to pass the assembly
 vitt mantri daawa karte hai ki isse bharat kii jidipi do pratishat bad jaaegi
 Is our GDP less by 2 percent due to not having GST? jiesti ke kaaran ham kis aadhaar par aashaa kar rahe hai ki apratyaksh kar kaa aadhaar bad jayega
 Is India's GDP low because a lot of businesses are not counted
 agar jiesti kaa matlab ek tex hona tha to rajyon ko petroleum par waite or cells tex lagane kii chhot kyon di gai
 The central government will compensate the states for any revenue loss for three years
 uske baad rajasav nuksaan hoga to rajya kya karenge isaki koi charchaa yaa ham aam logon ke bich samaj nahin he
 The GST Council will decide by three quarters
 desh main raajnneeti sthaayee nahin he
 The BJP may have an edge in the current era, but what will be so easy for the anti-bjp state in the GST Council
 maujuuda vyavastha main hi fund ko lekar centre or rajya ke bich jhagade hote rahete hai
 Is it not so that the Finance Minister of the state will sit in the office of GST Council
 ek or sawaal uthta he ki jab saare kar jiesti council se tay honge to rajyon main vitt mantri kya karegaa
 We Hindi viewers should go through these complex subjects so that when the government passes it in Parliament and makes big claims about it, then we too can understand its usefulness and historicity
 abhi bharat main paidaa hone vaale kisi bhi maal par centre or rajya milakar kai prakaar ke tex lagaate hai
 Such as sales tax, excise, octroi, VAT etc
 inhen aap apratyaksh kar kehete hai
 Tax where the goods were produced, from where it was sold or made, there was a variety of octroi all the way and if you bought it then tax
 vyapaariyon kaarobaariyon ke liye kai vibhaagon or kaagazon ke jhanjhat kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 Businesses in many places were drowned and many places had to run
 jaise ghaziabad main mashin or mashinari part par rajya sarkaar 14
 Imposes 5 percent tax
 isi item par aas paas ke kuch rajya paanch se saat pratishat kaa tex lagaate hai
 This weakens its business in Ghaziabad as people move to other states for this work
 ab hamen yah nahin maaloom ki agar sabhi jagah ek dar se tex laga diya jaae to sabhi jagah mashinari kaa dhandha chamakegaa yaa kisi ek yaa do jagah par hi chamakegaa
 If GST is applicable, tax has to be paid once and at the same place
 isse pehle waite or sarvice tex aayaa tha tab bhi unhen lekar khub sapane dikhaaye gaye the
 But now everyone is coming with a GST and dreams have become one
 tex kii ugaahi bad jaaegi or bharat kii jidipi bhi dashamalav nau se dedh se do pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The reasoning behind GDP growth is that there is no record of innumerable business at this time, hence the correct estimation of GDP is not done
 jiesti se jude jaankaar kehete hai ki jo bhi sevaayen dete hai chaahe ve vyapaaree hai yaa udyogpati agar unka salanaa turnover das lakh se adhik he to ritern file karnaa padegaa
 This will bring maximum real data to the government and increase the collection of taxes
 lekin jo jiesti aa rahaa he kya wo vaaki ek dar or ek prakaar kii kar pranali he
 Are the same taxes applicable everywhere after the implementation of GST? agar aisa he to isaki suchi main ye teen alag alag naam kya kehete hai
 Center GST, State GST, Inter State GST
 vitt mantri ne ise aarthik ekikaran kaha he to phir teen prakaar kii jiesti kyon hai
 Why is there not a type
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki teen prakaar kii jiesti ke kaaran ab vyapaaree kaa assesament bhi teen jagahon par dekha jayega
 It will continue as it was before
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ek hi ritern file kerani hogi lekin uski jaanch kam se kam do yaa teen adhikari centre yaa rajya ke str par karenge
 Will the system be the same somewhere? kya vaaki vibhaagon ke chakkar lagane se mukti mil jaaegi
 GST will be different on gold, silver and luxury
 aam janata se judi chizon par jiesti alag hogi
 If the mess of rate remains in GST, then what is the benefit of GST
 akhabaaron main zyaadaatar lekh or bayanon ko padhate hue jiesti kii prashansa hi milti he
 He says that GST is better than the last
 ek paripakv arthvyavastha main har tarah ke kaarobaar kaa record to hona hi chahie
 Are most people of India ready for this? awwal to raajnneetik dalon ko hi manaane main itane saal lag gaye to logon ko bhi vakt dena hi hoga
 It would be difficult to trade off the record
 duniya ke 160 se adhik deshon main jiesti lagu he
 Not applicable in US
 arun kumaar ne economik and polytical vikali main kuch sawaal uthaaye hai
 It is being said that GST will increase the share of indirect taxes in our GDP
 apratyaksh kar badhane se mudrasphiti badhati he to chizon ke daam kaise kam ho jaaenge
 Arun Kumar says that prices of most things will go up
 jiesti kaa asangathit kshetra ke karabor par kya asar padane vaala he
 Will it really reduce or eliminate the hidden black money in our economy
 kya jiesti vaaki har marz kii dawa he
 Professor Prabhat Patnaik has expressed the possibility of the federal structure being weakened over GST
 sangheey dhaanche kaa matlab aap yun samajhiye ki centre or rajya apane aarthik faisle apni apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se karenge
 After GST, there will be nothing left for states to do about tax
 wo har chiz ke liye centre par nirbhar ho jaaenge
 But the Finance Minister claims that most states have agreed to GST
 sirf tamilnadu ko kuch aapattiyaan hai
 The comments sansad kaa monusan satr ho saktaa he jiesti ke kaaran aitihaasik ho jaae
 The constitution amendment is a bill
 rajyasabha main paas hone ke baad aadhe rajyon kii vidhansabha se bhi paas hona hoga
 The Finance Minister claims that this will increase India's GDP by two percent
 kya vaaki jiesti nahin hone ke kaaran hamaari jidipi 2 pratishat kam he
 Due to GST, on what basis are we hoping that the indirect tax base will increase
 kya bharat kii jidipi isliye kam he ki bahut saare kaarobaaron kii ginati nahin he
 If GST was meant to be a tax, then why were the states allowed to levy VAT and sales tax on petroleum
 centre sarkaar rajyon ko teen saal tak jo bhi rajasav nuksaan hoga uski bharpai karegi
 After that there will be no loss of revenue or any discussion about what the state will do or we do not understand among the common people
 jiesti council main teen chauthai se faisla hoga
 Politics is not sustainable in the country
 maujuuda daur par bhaajapa ko badhat ho sakati he lekin jiesti council main bhaajapa virdohi rajya ke liye kya sthiti itani aasaan hogi
 In the current system, there are conflicts between the Center and the state over the fund
 kahin aisa to nahin ki rajya kaa vitt mantri jiesti council ke daftar main hi baitha rahegaa
 Another question arises that when all taxes will be decided by the GST Council, what will the Finance Minister do in the states
 ham hindi ke darshakon ko in jatil vishyon se guzar kar dekhnaa chahie taaki jab sarkaar sansad main ise paas kar ise lekar bade bade daawey kare to ham bhi isaki upyogita or aitihaasikta ko samaj saken

 The total expenditure in the form of tuition and hostel fees for Indian students studying abroad has increased by 44 percent
 yah kharch 2013-14 main 1
 9 billion dollars, which increased to 2 in 2017-18
 8 arab dollar ho chukaa he
 a recent report by the Reserve Bank of India has estimated that by 2024, nearly 400,000 Indian students will enroll in foreign universities
 yah aankade saaf bataate hai ki apane chaatro ko ucch shiksha ke liye videsh bhejne ke maamle main china ke baad bharat doosraa sabase mahatvapurn desh he
 At present, more than 5 million students worldwide are studying outside their country and there is a large number of Indian students
 videshi shiksha hasil karne ke maamle main bharatiyon kii pehali pasand america, canada or euke jaise desh hai
 It is followed by Singapore, China, Australia and other European countries such as Germany and France
 arabiai kii report ke mutabik, ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jane vaale kul bhartiya chaatro main 85 fisadi inhen deshon main jate hai
 However, the number of Indian students enrolled in universities of many other countries has also increased
 news agency IANS kii report ke anusaar policy bazaar ke chif bijness afisar tarun maathur kaa kahana he ki ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jate vakt medical kharcho ko cover karnaa travel insurance kharidne ke sabase jaruri kaarnon main se ek he
 Needless to say that medical expenses abroad can be quite expensive compared to India
 udhaaharan ke taur par, america main ek doctor kii kansaltesan fees 300 se 400 dollar ke bich he, jo ki bharat ke liye 20,500 se 27,000 rupee ke aasapaas hoti he
 He said that if a student falls ill abroad without travel insurance, then he / she will have to spend their one week budget only in consultation with doctor / emergency room visit charges, which does not include the cost of medicines
 aise main insurance cover lenaa behad jaruri hota he taaki biimaar padane par hone vaale kharch se bachaa ja sake
 Mathur said that Student Travel Insurance gives you comprehensive coverage for medical emergency as well as protection for other potential problems such as interruption of studies, sponsor protection, cancellation of university accreditation, loss of laptop / table, travel Lost baggage, passport or other important documents during aise main yah sunishchit karnaa behad jaruri he ki ek student travel insurance kharidte vakt kuch behad gambhir pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae
 One of the most important aspects is to see that your student travel insurance follows the guidelines issued by your university
 student travel insurance plan kaa kawarej uniwarsity ke dishanirdeshon ke anukool naa hone par sambandhit uniwarsity ke paas student kaa insurance wevar benifit asweekaar karne yaa admician hi radd karne kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 Most universities in the US and Canada demand that international students keep an insurance plan for themselves that covers all the expenses of pre-existing diseases, drug habit, pregnancy and mental illness without any sub-limit
 iske alaava, kuch uniwarsities is baat par bhi jor detii hai ki antarrashtriya chaatr apane grih deshon kii insurance companiyon se hi travel insurance khariden
 It is also better for Indian students going abroad to buy travel policy from insurance companies of India as the prices are very low here and the students also get more benefits

 The department has been spending crores of rupees every year in the last 10 years under its various schemes
 vahiin sarkari report main yah baat nikal kar saamne ai he ki itane varshon main sarvaadhik paudha ropan hone ke baavjood bhi 3700 varg kilometre jangal ghat gaya
 Now the scams can be gauged from the fact that every year a green forest was being recorded in the government records
 dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki wanon ke rakh rakhaav par salanaa badi rakam bhi kharch kii ja rahi thi
 In this scam, the top officers of the forest department were filling their chest in a planned manner

 It is said that forest department officials bought millions of trees every year at the behest of a politically influential person
 unka karodon main bhugtan hua
 But in reality the tree did not come
 khanaapurti ke liye paudhe nursery main laa diye gaye, sarkari poudharopan kaarykram main mukhya atithi ke haathon paudharopan bhi kara diya gaya
 Photos of the ceremony were widely publicized
 duusari ore jangal ghatate chale gaye
 At present, the next hearing of the case will be on January 17 in the Chhattisgarh High Court
 holi khelnaa sabhi ko pansad hota he
 Children or women all prepare for Holi with great enthusiasm, but this enthusiasm fades when your accessories are either spoiled or lost somewhere in Holi, but do you want this Holi neither Lose and not spoil your accessories? If your answer is yes, then these tips are for you- ladies ko holi par adhik lambey yearringske istemaal se bachanaa chahie
 Because the risk of such earrings getting stuck in dressage remains equal
 isliye inke sthaan par chote-chote tops kaa istemaal karen
 Mobile which has become the need of all today
 yun to aajkal water pruf mobile aane lage hai, lekin yadi aapke paas aisa mobile nahin he, to koshish karen ki jab aap holi khel rahi hon, to apana mobile yaa to switch of kar den yaa phir rang lagane vaale ko ye bataa den ki aapke paas mobile he
 If possible, use only color and not water on Holi
 holi par adhik hai hill vaale or platform hill ke footvier se parhez kerani chahie
 Nowadays many light colored footwear have started coming in the market, which the ladies love very much, but if you wear them in Holi, it will be very difficult for you to remove the color from them
 isliye lite colors ke footvier holi par na pahanen
 If you use sunglasses, then be careful not to use more light colored sunglasses on Holi day, sunglasses of light color can spoil due to Holi colors
 holi par baalo main lagane vaali accessories kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Do not put any accessories in the hair that are too long and are afraid of getting stuck or stuck somewhere
 yadi aap chudiyaan pahenti hai to is din kaanch kii chudiyon kii jagah plastic kii chudiyon yaa simpal kadon kaa istemaal kare
 Because there is a possibility of their breakage and injury while playing color
 yadi aap ghadi pahanane kii shaukin hai, to waterpruf ghadi kaa istemaal karen
 If you are wearing a ring, then use an artificial ring instead of gold
 saath hi adhik dhili ring pahane se bhi bachein

 party kii hidaayat ke baad hi anil vij ne apane bayaan par maafee bhi maang lee he
 On the other hand, from Sharad Yadav to senior Congress leader Anand Sharma are saying that it is an old habit of BJP leaders to make controversial statements in this manner and it has come to know how much respect they have for Gandhiji
 matlab saaf he khaadi se lekar gandhi tak jo vivaad shuru hua he vah jaldi hi thaamne vaala nahin he
 In this season of elections, you will continue to hear statements of this manner from both the ruling and the opposition

 Tusshar Gandhi said that this is a campaign run by the party headquarters and the RSS
 khaadi koi product nahin, ek vichaardhaara he
 The Prime Minister speaks about Gandhiji, but does not take any action against such speakers
 sipiiem netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi vij ke bayaan kii ninda karte hue kaha ki ye vahi vichaardhaara he, jisane gandhiji ko maaraa
 First he eliminated Gandhi from this country and now he wants to remove him from the currency too
 congress ke randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki bijepi ke netaaon or mantriyon se aise hi aapattijanak or ootpataang bayanon kii ummid kar sakate hai
 This was the statement of Anil Vij that Gandhi's name is such that Khadi has drowned due to its association
 modi unase behatar brands hai isliye acha he ki gandhi kii bajaay modi kaa photo laga he
 Gandhi's name is on the notes, causing the devaluation of the rupee

 chidambaram har charan main unase baat kar rahe the, unase sahamat ho rahe the or herapheri main unke varisht bhagidaar the, spectrum kii keemten tay karne kii jaankaree unhen har samay thi, or sabase khaas baat yah he ki 10 janvari, 2008 ko unhone raja ke kiye gaye sabhi faislon par aankh mundakar apni manjuuri di thi
 i am under no illusion that Chidambaram was a major participant in this horrific corruption case
 har kisi ne unke nirdeshon par kaam kiya he-mukhyatah raja or karunanidhi ne
 The same thing gave the king the courage to show the thumb to the Prime Minister

 More than this, even after the license was issued, on 25 March 2011, the Finance Ministry's Office Memorandum clearly states that the terms of the license could have been changed if the Ministry had desired

 They will allow me to cross-examine Khullar, whom i will ask a simple question — whether or not you told your minister that the Transaction of Business Rules gave him January 9, the day before the events of January 10
 Even to this, it gives the right to refer the matter to the cabinet? Similarly i will ask Awasthi why the agency did not take action against Etisalat and Telenor

 These documents prove that these two companies should not be allowed to do business in India, as they do business with Pakistan and China
 supreme court ne sibiai se is maamle kii jaanch karne ke liye kaha tha, kyonki grih mantralay in donon companiyon ko pratibandhit karwaanaa chahta tha
 i want to ask Awasthi - if you get these documents, why didn't you act on them and how did you allow the sale of new shares in both Swan and Unitech Wireless to these two companies? - The reason for your dislike for Chidambaram What is it? i have no enmity with them
 karunanidhi ne kaha tha ki main ek brahman hum, isliye raja se meraa vair-bhav he

 jahaan tak vyavsaayiyon kaa sawaal he, to vah sibiai par nirbhar he
 But my investigation will result
 ab main bahut najadik pahunch chukaa hum

 ve jis vichaardhaara ke pairokaar hai usamen 2002 kii ghatnaon ko lekar kisi tarah ke pachhataave ko sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 They have been saying this in the form of Hindu pride and strength

 This is happening at a time when the Sangh is trying to connect with the aspirations of 21st century India, an India that wants to grow, progress and also want the world to voice its voice without narrow ideology or stifling obstacles
 Listened to, he must gain the strength to admit his mistakes

 ) Aaj Tak reached Chhattisgarh to show how the bureaucracy dominates the elected governments and how they take decisions in the interest of drought-stricken farmers by sitting in air condition rooms
 is baar yahaan sookhaa padaa he
 Proposal for the work of five thousand crores has been sent to the central government for the opening of drought relief work in 22 of the 27 districts of the state
 iske alaava kisaanon ko sookhaa raahat package dene ke liye 22 hajaar karod kaa bhi prapojal centre sarkaar ke paas vichaaradhin he
 96 tehsils have been declared duly drought prone in the state
 kul milakar rajya kaa 90 fisadi hissaa suukhaagrast he
 Despite this, bureaucrats have decided to buy about 70 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in Chhattisgarh
 wo bhi kareeb 15 hajaar karod kii laagat se
 This decision has been taken at a time when drought in all the farm fields in the state has not been produced due to the drought and farmers are on the roads for drought relief
 jab rajya main sookhaa he to itani baari maatra main ye afasar dhan kahaan se laaenge
 Not only the farmer is also surprised to know about the purchase
 khet khalihaanon kaa rukh kiya jaae to pataa padegaa ki fasal hui hi nahin he
 Due to less than average rainfall, more than one-third of the parts of the state either did not sow the farmers or the farmers who sowed their crops were destroyed due to drought
 kai ilaakon main kisaanon ne nasht hui fasalon ko maweshiyon ko khilaanaa bhi shuru kar diya
 So that the field can be cleared for next sowing more or less
 sookhe kaa jayja lene ke baad sarkaar ne sookhaa raahat kaam khole jane ko lekar centre kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 The Chief Minister of the state Raman Singh also got 21 hundred crore rupees as immediate help
 taaki kisaanon ko pichhli buaai ke liye bataur protsaahan bonus kii rakam di ja sake
 Apart from this, a drought relief package has been demanded from the central government
 wo bhi baqayda manaregaa or duusari yojanaon ke jariye raahat kaa kaam kholaa ja sake
 There was a cabinet meeting in which the BJP government of the state, citing the drought, decided that it was opening its vault for the farmers

 Officers' intention to buy 70 lakh metric tons of paddy comes at a time when there is no drought in any part of the state nor insect kites are attacked on the crops, and even the monsoon is well in the entire state
 
 lekin dhan kharidi kii yojana ban gayi
 Chief Minister also gave praise to the top officers
 lekin kisaan sadako par utar aaye
 He questioned the government that when there is a drought and there is no yield, where will the paddy come from? kisaano ko andeshaa he ki maukey kaa phayda uthaa kar afasaron ne chaukaa maaraa
 There will be smuggling of paddy from neighboring states and amidst chaos, the BJP government in the state will buy rice and rice from farmers and middlemen instead of crop-producing farmers
 sanyukt kisaan morche ke adhyaksh anil dube kaa aarope he ki kuch sarkari afasar or sarkaar ke mantri padosi rajyon se dhan kii afratfari kar rajya main dhan khapaana chaahate hai
 This will benefit them, but the interest of the farmers here will be killed
 unke mutabik jab sookhe kii vajah se dhan kii paidaavaar hi nahin hui, to aise main kaha se dhan aegi iskaa jawaab sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 Chhattisgarh is number one in the country in terms of rice production
 yahaan kaa chaaval PDS ke jariye desh bhar main vitarit hota he
 The central and state governments procure paddy on a large scale annually
 isi dhan kii custom milling ke jariye chaaval nikaala jaataa he or phir yahi chaaval centre sarkaar ke warehouse main jamaa kiya jaataa he
 The situation in the state is that due to less than average rains, the fields have become dry
 ground water level kaaphi neeche ja chukaa he
 The water shortage has just started
 kisaan apane sookhe kheto main naharon ke jariye bandho se pani kii maang kar rahe he, taaki bechney ke liye naa sahi kam se kam pet bharne ke liye saag subjiyon or fasalon ko uga sake

 rahul gandhi ke liye abhi nahin to kabhi nahin vaali naubat kaise aa pahunchi? ek netaa ke rup main rahul ne raajnneeti main 2003 main sakriy rup se kadam rakhaa or dhire-dhire raajnneeti ke gur seekhney lage
 Despite belonging to a well-known political dynasty and a long legacy of politics, Rahul has never been very natural and comfortable in politics
 34 saal kii umr main party main shaamil hone ke baad bhi unhone aage badhkar badi jimmedaariyaan uthaane or netritv karne main sankoch kiya
 He loved working behind the scenes
 unke aavegpurn nirnyon, party ke puraane diggajon kii chhatrachhaaya main asahaj mahasoos karne or tikhe tevar ke saath kahi gai baton ke kaaran aksar kuch-na-kuch vivaad khadaa ho jaataa tha
 Rahul wanted to do different kinds of politics from the beginning
 ve apane doston ko bataaya karte the ki bhartiya raajnneeti kaa satahipan dekhakar ve "hairaan'' hai
 They do not want to become another leader involved in the same sheep or do not want to enter politics simply because they come from a political family and should inherit their family
 ve neeche se upar tak congress kaa navnirmaan chaahate the, lekin unhen jaldi hi samaj main aa gaya ki party main kaaryakartaaon se zyada, netaa maujuud hai or ye sabhi isliye jude hai kyonki unhen raajnneeti bahut laabhadaayak lagati he
 As he says, "my biggest challenge is a cultural problem associated with all political parties in the country
" saare netaa—haalanki kuch apwaad bhi hai—ek baar satta main aane ke baad abhimaani ban jate hai or aisa sochane lagate hai ki ve ab badshaah ho gaye hai
 But as Mahatma Gandhi said - he is a trustee
 ''congress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ke 10 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan rahul ke paas kai avasar the jab ve aage aakar daayitv sambhaal sakate the lekin rahul ne apane doston se kaha ki ve kabhi tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh, yaa party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich satta kaa ek vaikalpik centre nahin bananaa chaahate the
 He preferred to play roles from behind the scenes
 haal hi main unhone khulaasa kiya ki jab upie satta main thi, unhone mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium (manaregaa) kii shuruyaat karai thi or ise safal banane kii disha main kaam kiya tha
 Apart from this, along with the top ministers and leaders of the Congress, they were trying to normalize the situation in Kashmir
 unhone yah bhi kabool kiya ki unhone upie sarkaar ke dauraan khud ko ek ajeeb sthiti main paaya tha
 They had to face charges for any wrongdoing of the UPA and they could not even attack when the government was going the way
 rahul kaa janm ek pratishthit or mahaan parivaar main hua
 Special greatness was always expected from them, or it was said that many times they were given
 lekin rahul kaa maananaa he, ve yah mahaan kaam jab bhi karenge, apni sharton par karenge or tab karenge jab khud unhen—unki party yaa unki maa ko nahin—mahasoos hone lagegaa ki ve iske liye sachmuch taiyaar hai
 14 years after joining politics, he felt that the time had come
 unhone pichley saal hi party adhyaksh bananaa kyon chunaa? rahul kehete hai, "congress party ek aisi vichaardhaara he jisaki jaden, gahare vichaaron se majboot hui hai
 i felt that i needed some time to understand these ideas
 ab main ise behatar tareeke se samajhataa hum
 His opponents called his hesitation a sign of his weakness and objected that Rahul did not have the ability to lead the country's oldest party and take the country forward
 baharhaal, desh ko unki yaa congress ke intjaar kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 As the UPA government defaulted on many fronts in its second term, Rahul could not get himself out of confusion and indecision
 in sabase narendra modi ke asaadhaaran udai ke liye jagah banati chali gai
 a Chief Minister who was always put in the dock for dealing with communal violence, Modi coined a new crop which affected the country
 congress netritv ke anirnay kaa modi ne bharpoor phayda uthaaya
 Modi came to the pinnacle of power with the help of a strong organization of the BJP-RSS, presenting his image of the common man as an ordinary chaiwala and talking about Gujarat development model
 satta main bane rahane ke liye namadaaron par unka bharosa sabko hairaan kar rahaa he
 The BJP won a majority in 2014 and it was the first time in 25 years
 congress kaa pradarshan bahut kharaab rahaa or rahul tathaa sonia apni siten bachaa paae
 The 2014 defeat was "a huge storm" for Rahul and Rahul admits that "it was the most appropriate thing for me"
 vah agnipariksha kaa kshan tha
 It was time not to introspect but to do something
 rahul ne chunauti ko sweekaar kiya
 He started fathoming the Congress organization
 bujurgon or yuvaaon ke bich ek gahari khai dikhti thi or rahul ko vah khai paatani thi
 He could see that two congresses were active within one Congress
 puraane diggajon ko ek kone main lagane ke bajaay, jinamein kai kii ve pehle bhi andekhi kar chuke the, rahul ne unki samaj or anubhav kaa phayda lene ke liye unhen bhi saath rakhaa or party main yuva netritv ke liye bhi jagah banaate gaye
 They have worked hard
 sabko ko vaazib adhikaar or sthaan dena tha
 He said that it was the "congress sandpaper" that smoothed his rough edges
 rahul kaa doosraa formula har rajya main puraane or yuva netaaon kii mili-juli ek pratibhasampann toli taiyaar karnaa tha
 Therefore, Kamal Nath was given the command of the party in Madhya Pradesh and other young leaders including Jyotiraditya Scindia were given big roles
 rajasthan main unhone sachin payalat ko pradesh adhyaksh banaaya lekin do baar ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko darkinar karne kii galati nahin kii, jinaki rajya main acchhee pakad he
 Although it was the turn of the Chief Minister, Rahul trusted the old leaders only
 jaisaa ki ek varisht netaa kehete hai, "party main donon pakshon ke bich ek pul kii darkaar thi lekin unhone party ko agali peedi kii ore le jane kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 After posting reconciliation among the contenders, he posted a smiling picture of the aspirants for the post of Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 sandesh ekadam saaf tha ki ve har kisi ko saath lekar, sahmati taiyaar karne main yakeen rakhte hai, apana faisla kisi par thopate nahin
 Rahul has also mastered the style of prompt action for crisis resolution
 madhya pradesh chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan party kaaryakartaaon ke saath ek anaupchaarik baatcheet main rajya congress ke diggaj netaa digvijay singh ne kaha, "main bhaashan dene bhi nahin jaaoongaa kyonki main bolta hum to congress haar jaati he
 "that statement was captured on camera and the media considered it to be the rebellious attitude of Digvijay Singh
" rahul ne baat kii or unase usee din muraina ke paas jora kii raily main apane saath manch par maujuud rahane kaa aagrah kiya
 Later that night, Digvijay came to Delhi with Rahul in the plane and dismantled the notion that there was factionalism in the Congress
 congress kaaryakarini ke ek sadsy kehete hai, "ve ab teji se harakat main aa jate hai
 An example of such an immediate decision was the agreement with the Janata Dal (secular) immediately after the results of the Karnataka assembly elections in May
 congress 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 80 siton ke saath duusari sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari thi lekin rahul bhaajapa ko gaddi se dur rakhane ke liye jedies netaa ech
 D
 kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri ke pad kii peshkash karne se nahin hichake
 The BJP was nine behind the required figures to form the government
 goa, manipur or meghalaya main sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne ke baavjood congress ko bhaajapa ne vidhayakon ke fatafat jod-jugad se use maat de di thi
 Taking lessons from those incidents, Rahul immediately dispatched two veterans Ashok Gehlot and Ghulam Nabi Azad, who specializes in political manipulations in Karnataka, to take away the stake from the BJP
 karnataka ke rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bhaajapa sarkaar ko shapath dilaa di to rahul ne abhishek manu singhvi ko chandigarh se bula bheja, taaki supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya ja sake
 In this way, the BJP government in the state had to resign within 48 hours
 ahamed patel, kamalnath or gahalot par rahul kaa daanv lagaana darshata he ki ve ab yah samajhane lage hai ki chunavi raajnneeti main parade ke peeche kii pantarebaaji bhi bahut mahatvapurn he
 a Congress general secretary says, "in 2019, the Congress will have to fight Modi's charisma and bjp's money power
 jahaan congress adhyaksh modi ko lalakaarenge, vishaal network vaale ye diggaj agle saal chunaav ladgaye ke liye jaruri paise ke jugad kii jimmedaari sanbhaalenge
 "one of the biggest motives behind Rahul's speeches and interactions between several global universities and think tanks in the last two years was resource mobilization
" rahul kii aisi hi videsh yatraaon main se ek main unke saath rahe, congress ke ek yuva netaa kehete hai, "2014 main modi ke chunaav abhiyaan main enarai se mili fund ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 By traveling abroad and interacting with nris, he showed that while Modi talks like Street Fighter, Rahul is gentle and in his style a glimpse of an intellectual person
 ''rahul gandhi ne india today se kaha ki congress main ve jo kaam karne kii koshishen kar rahe hai, unamem ek he logon kii baaten sunanaa or sabaki sunne ke baad hi koi nirnay lenaa
 They say "by doing this, you can get reasonably close to the result and this dramatically improves the spirit of the organization
" '' is saal kii shuruyaat main, rahul ne shakti mobile aplication launch kiya, jisase na keval party ke saath judye vaale nae logon kii jaankaree milti he, balki congress adhyaksh or jamini kaaryakartaaon ke bich dotarafa samvaad bhi kaayam ho jaataa he
 Rahul made extensive use of information gathered from grassroots workers through the Shakti app
 karnataka main research team kii chunaav ke dauraan dinesh gundu raav ke pradarshan kii report par pradesh adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya
 Rahul's second big challenge is the Hindutva ideology of the RSS-BJP
 ve kehete hai, "hamaari mukhya ladaai un chand logon ke khilaaf he jo yah maanane lage hai ki ve hi bharat ke bhagya vidhaataa hai
 Modi and Shah believe that they are India
 yah bharat kaa apmaan he
 India is an idea which is much larger than any individual or group
 hamaara maananaa he ki is desh ko sauhardpurvak chalaanaa he, na ki nirankushta yaa taanaashaahee se
 Congress ideology makes people feel that they are the main part of a great mission
 congress kaa yahi mantra he
 Some people of Opposition and BJP also understand this
 ''2014 main congress kii haar ke baad se hi rahul ne congress ke vajood ke liye sabase bade khataron main se ek ke taur par aresas ko pahchaan liya tha
 With its aggressive Hindutva agenda and with the support of the Sangh Parivar, the BJP had created a success with considerable success, in which the Congress was seen as a party favored by Muslims and also that its favor was majority in the majority
 The community has suffered
 party ke halkon main kaha jaataa he ki hindu dharm par bhaajapa ke ekadhikaar ko lalkaarane kaa faisla bahut soch-samajhakar liya gaya tha, jiske chalate janeudhari brahman se lekar dattatreya gotra tak ek nae rahul gandhi kaa ubhaar dekha gaya
 Along with this, Rahul knows that his own target should be Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha, "ek shaam 8 baje modi ko ilham hua or unhone notebandi ke jariye anaupchaarik arthvyavastha ko tahas-nahasyy kar diya
 Unfortunately, apart from criticizing Modi for failing on many fronts, Rahul has not yet put forward an alternative vision or vision of development that can woo voters - and businessmen
 jahaan teen rajyon kii jeet se congress kii ummiden paravaan chadh gai hai, vahiin jeet-haar ke antar ke hisaab se loksabhaa siton kaa mijaan lagaaya jaae, to pataa chalata he ki party in 65 siton main se mahaj 32 hi jeet paaegi
 Even if you add 42 seats in other states ruled by the party, Karnataka, Punjab and Puducherry, it is only 107 seats
 aise main congress ke liye 2019 main bhaajapa ko satta se bedakhal karne kaa akelaa rasta yah he ki vah duusari vipakshi partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kaayam kare
 Rahul says that he is "open to dialogue with these political parties" and his goal is to "work together" with these parties while respecting their different areas of influence
 2019 main bhaajapa ko haraana jahaan pahaad chadhgaye sareekha mushkil kaam he, vahiin rahul jaanate hai ki ise hasil karne se pehle unhen abhi kai or pahaad chadhgaye honge
 But in 2018, he has shown a strong dent in the unbeatable image of the BJP that he has the ability to counter the power of modi-shah duo
 unhone congress ko phir se jinda karne kaa sanket diya he or agle aam chunaav main modi ke awwal chalanger ke taur par ubhar aae hai
 It is for this reason that the editors of India Today chose Rahul Gandhi as the headlines of 2018
 siyaasi safarnama2004 main chunavi raajnneeti main utarane ke baad rahul gandhi ke ahm rajnatik mukaam2004: raajnneeti main pravesh kiya or amethi se chunaav ladaa, jahaan kaa pratinidhitiv unke pita rajeev gandhi kiya karte the

 He not only showed political maturity by offering the post of CM to a coalition partner, but also effectively deployed the veterans of his party's law to win this nasal battle for Congress

 But what happened? Despite opening of smog at the box office on Wednesday last week and creating many records of the year, the stigma created in the huge budget of about 150 crores is like an accident for the box office

 is baar putalon ke bazaar main ‘ravan' kaa kad or chota ho gaya he
 Mannequin-making artisans of Tatarpur village in west Delhi, the capital, are facing a double whammy
 in kaarigaron kaa kahana he, ‘‘arthvyavastha sust he, saath hi putala banane vaali samagriyon ke daam kaaphi chadh chuke hai
 In such a situation, we have to reduce the size of the mannequins considerably
 ''tatarpur putalon kaa pramukh bazaar he, lekin is saal yahaan kuch hi sthanon par putale banaae ja rahe hai
 The artisans here have been given a place in Berry Wala Bagh in Subhash Nagar
 iske alaava raja garden fliover se lekar subhash nagar, rajouri garden or raghubir nagar ilaakon main karigar din raat putalon kii saaj-sajja main jute hai
 About 45 days before Dussehra, artisans from nearby states come to the big 'shopkeepers' who make mannequins
 putala banane waalon main dilli ke alaava haryana, punjab, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh or karnataka tak ke karigar shaamil hai
 "there is a slowdown in the economy," says Mahendra, who has been making effigy for the last 25 years
 anya kshetron kii tarah iskaa asar putalon ke kaarobaar par bhi padaa he
 Because of this we have had to reduce the size of the mannequins because the larger the mannequin, the higher the cost and the price will also increase accordingly
 '' mahendra ne kaha, ‘‘putala banane kii saamagree bhi kaaphi mahangi ho chuki he
 The price of 20 bamboo clams has gone up to Rs 1,200-1,300 which was Rs 1,000 till last year
 putala baandhne main kaam aane vaali taar bhi 50 rupee kilo ke bajaay 150 rupee main mil rahi he
 The price of paper has almost doubled
 ''tees saal se adhik samay se putala banane ke kaarobaar se jude subhash ne kaha, ‘‘kabhi tatarpur kaa ravan videsh bhi bheja jaataa tha
 From here, effigies of Ravana were specially sent to Australia, but now there is no demand from abroad
 '' haryana ke karnal se yahaan aakar putala banane vaale sanjay ne kaha ki kabhi tatarpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon main 60-70 foot tak ke bhi putale banaae jate the, lekin ab daam chadhane or jagah kii kami kii vajah se aayojak chote putalon kii maang karne lage hai
 Sanjay says that today there is a demand for effigies of Ravana, but the effigies of Kumbhakarna and Meghnad's effigies are few
 graahak dwaara kumbhakarna yaa meghnad kaa putala maangane par putale kaa rang badal diya jaataa he yaa moonchhen choti kar di jaati hai
 Raju, engaged in making effigies under Tagore Garden metro station, said that effigies of up to 40 feet are being made in and around Tatarpur
 is baar 40 foot ke putale kaa daam 17,000 se 20,000 rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 Till last year it was Rs 12,000-13,000
 haalanki, raju ne kaha ki putalon kaa daam graahak dekhakar tay kiya jaataa he
 Gokul, an artisan from Madhya Pradesh, said, "this time, five to ten feet effigies are being made specifically for children
 '' gokul ne bataaya ki bacchon ke liye banaae ja rahe paanch se das foot ke ‘chote ravan' kaa daam 1,500 se 4,000 rupee tak he
 Every big shopkeeper who makes mannequins employs 20 to 30 people
 tatarpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon se putale haryana, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, punjab tak bheje jate hai
 At present, more than 500 mannequins are being made in Tatarpur and surrounding areas, whereas more than 1,000 mannequins were once made in Tatarpur alone
 inaki maang har saal lagaataar ghat rahi he or aakaar bhi chota ho ja rahaa he

 Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has again made such a statement about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is going to be disputed
 unhone kaha ki agar congress ke saath mahila kaaryakarta jud jaaen to modi ko samandar tak pahunchaa denge
 Mani Shankar made this statement at the Congress women's conference
 unhone kaha ki agar desh kii mahilaayein congress se jud jaaen to modi ji kii gandhinagar vaapasi tay he
 Not only this, we can take them to the sea
 to bahut acha he
 Mani Shankar Aiyar said, 'I am ready to work with you among the women of the village
 vahaan bhi hamaari party jaaegi
 These women coming from poor sections have shown that they want to do public work
 aisi mahilaon ko congress se joda to modi ji ko kal tak gandhinagar waapas janaa hoga

 Half of the country's population has given such a referendum that the Congress Lok Sabha leader is forced to visit the court for the post of Opposition
 unhen is tarah ke bayaan dene se pehle aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 Modi ji is very far away
 ye log khud ko thik kar len to zyada behatar
 If Modi ji shows his dreams, he will fulfill them too
 kyonki unke andar madda bhi he
 'it is worth mentioning that before the Lok Sabha elections, Mani Shankar Aiyar had made such a statement about Modi, which BJP used as an election tactic
 manishankar ayyar ne kaha tha, 'narendra modi 21veen sadi main kabhi bhi pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate hai
 But if they want to sell tea here (AICC meeting), then we can arrange it
 'unke is bayaan kaa zikr modi ne baar-baar apane chunavi bhaashanon main karte rahe

 phone teping kii taaja sansanikhej report kaa gambhir sangyaan lete hue varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani ne is ghatana kii tulana apatkaal ke dinon se kii
 Citing the latest issue of a magazine, Advani has written in his blog that it is a "shocking report" that reveals how the Indian government used the latest phone tapping technology to communicate telephonic conversations between prominent political leaders
 It is doing in recording
 in pramukh netaaon main nitish kumaar jaise mukhyamantri, sharad pavaar jaise kendriya mantri, prakaash karaat jaise communist netaa or congress mahasachiv digvijay singh jaise sattarudh party ke apane padaadhikari shaamil hai
 Demanding the abolition of the 'outdated' Telephone Act, Advani also advocated for a new law to protect the privacy of citizens
 unhone blog main likhaa he, ‘is sandarbh main vastav main jo jaruri he, vah yah ki samasya kii sabhi pahaluon se padtaal karne, bekaar ho chuke bhartiya telephone adhinium 1885 ko samaapt karne tathaa aam naagarik kii niztaa kii suraksha ke liye iske sthaan par nayaa kanoon banane ke liye britain main bricket samiti kii tarj par ek sansadeey samiti gathit kii jaae
 Advani has written in the blog that the new law should be such that protects the privacy of ordinary citizens but which formally recognizes the use of latest IT technology in the state only in cases of crime, scams and espionage
 is kanoon main sanvidhik suraksha maanak avashya hon jo sarkaar ke liye raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon tathaa mediakarmiyon ke khilaaf is kanoon kii shaktiyon kaa durupyog asambhav bana den
 Advani writes about referring to a 25-year-old incident
 ‘yah mujhe 25 saal puraani ek ghatana kii yaad dilaataa he jisase meraa vaasta padaa tha
 One morning in 1985, a stranger came to my house with a briefcase full of papers in his hand
 ’ us ajanabi ne kaha, ‘is brifces main dynamite he, jo is sarkaar ko uda saktaa he
 He opened his briefcase and piled around 200 pages containing a record of telephone conversations of several vips
 lekin adwani ko ye dastavej itane ‘visphotak’ nahin lage jitna un sajjan ne bataaya tha
 Some of these papers had details of Advani's conversation with Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 adwani ne likhaa, ‘adhik hairaani yah jaankaar hui ki in dastavejon main na keval vipakshi netaaon kii aapasi baatcheet ko tepe ricard kiya gaya tha balki kuch khyatinaam patrkaar or gyani jail singh jaisi behad pratishthit hastiyon kii baatcheet bhi ricard thi
 Advani's blog mentions several incidents of phone tapping in the past including a press conference on 25 June 1985
 is din apatkaal kii dasvin varshganth thi jisamen vaajapeyi ne apatkaal kii na keval anya jyadatiyon kaa zikr kiya tha balki 19 maheene kii is avadhi main bade paimaane par hui phone teping ghatnaon kaa bhi ullekh kiya tha
 He has written that in that press conference Vajpayee said, 'I have known for a long time that the phone of me and my party colleague Advani is being monitored
 ’ vaajapeyi ne kaha, ‘lekin baad main mujhe pataa chalaa ki choudhary charan singh, jagjeevanram or chandrashekhar jaise varisht netaaon, ji ke reddy, arun shouri, kuldeep nair tathaa ji es chawla jaise patrakaron ke phone bhi niyamit rup se tepe kiye ja rahe hai
 But even more shocking, i felt aware that the Intelligence Bureau has tapped phones up to the President and the Chief Justice
 yah sab na keval raajnneetik rup se aniatik he balki asanvaidhanik or gaiyrkanoonee bhi he
 'advani has written in the blog referring to another incident of phone tapping' In 1996, when Deve Gowda was Prime Minister, a high-level Congress delegation led by former Home Minister SB Chavan complained to him that PV Narasimha Rao And the phones of several other senior Congress leaders are being tapped by the Uttar Pradesh government

 (narendra modi ke janmdin par vyangy baat, kripaya halake main len or halake phulke bane rahen) Let us help the government in finding black money
 notebandi ko gujarey ek saal guzar gaya
 No big hand was lost
 le-dekar garib kalyaan yojana main aae 5,000 karod rupye hi hai jinhen adhikrut taur par notebandi kaa hasil kaala dhan mana ja saktaa he
 Everything else is in the investigative era or ridden with claims
 to kahaan milegaa kaala dhan?bagal main chhora, gaanv main dhindhora
 Some big secrets of black money lie with the government's pyari-dulari Jan Dhan Yojana
 garibon ko banking se jodgaye ke liye jise shuru kiya gaya tha
 After demonetisation, the government has drawn silence on public money, but the figures are available
 rigerv bank ne notebandi ke asar par report isi march main jari kii thi
 The Finance Minister gave some information in response to a question in Parliament on 3 February, other studies based on government data are also available
 inke aadhaar par dekhie ki notebandi ke dauraan jan dhan kya hua tha?• notebandi se pehle april se july ke bich lagbhag 73,000 khate prati din khole ja rahe the lekin notebandi ke dauraan prati din do lakh khate khule
 The average daily opening of Jan Dhan accounts fell to 92,000 between the end of all currency change notes (march to July 2017)
 • notebandi ke thik baad 23
 30 crore new Jan Dhan accounts were opened
 inamen se 80 fisadi sarkari bainkon main khule
 About 54 percent opened in cities and branches in the remaining villages
 • notebandi ke vakt (9 november 2016) ko in khaaton main kul 456 arab rupye jamaa the jo 7 disambar 2016 ko 746 arab rupye par pahunch gaye
 • Rs 42,187 crore deposited in Jan Dhan accounts in 53 days of demonetisation
 inamen se 18,616 karod rupye to 9 november se 16 november ke bich shuruaati aath dinon main hi in khaaton main jamaa ho gaye
 This figure is 1850% higher than the 53 days before demonetisation
 • notebandi ke pehle jan dhan khaaton main ausatan 43 karod rupye kaa dainik jamaa hota tha
 As soon as demonetisation started, Rs 2,327 crore started accumulating in the first week
 notebandi khatm hote hi everej daily tranjaction main 95 fisadi kii kami darj kii gai
 • Gujarat was at the forefront of showing the power of Jan Dhan during demonetisation
 9 november 2016 se 25 janvari 2017 tak rajya ke jan dhan khaaton ke diposit main 94 fisadi kaa ijapha hua
 In the same period, Jan Dhan deposits increased by 81 percent in Karnataka, 60 percent in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, 55 percent in Jharkhand and Rajasthan, 54 percent in Bihar, 50 percent in Haryana, 45 percent in Uttar Pradesh and 44 percent in Delhi
 • jan dhan khaaton main notebandi ke pehle hakrate main diposit main 40 fisadi kii growth dekhakar 15 november 2016 ko vitt mantralay ne ek baar main 50 hajaar rupye se zyada raashi jan dhan main jamaa karne par roak laga di
 • During demonetisation, the average balance of Jan Dhan accounts had increased by 180 per cent, which came down to the previous level of demonetisation in March
 • garibon ke jiro balance khaaton kaa vyavhaar gahare sawaal khadey karata he
 What is the secret of the unprecedented increase in the number of these accounts during demonetisation? The Finance Minister had told Parliament in February that the Income Tax Department has sent 5,100 notices to various account holders (including Jan Dhan), after which, where is the investigation of demonetisation public money usage? Lost? Why did banks start investigating irregularities during demonetisation? Why did we miss the conclusion that Jan Dhan Khata हुआ used in money laundering but during demonetisation a lot has happened within banks which is mysterious and may be the reason for the failure of demonetisation
 aam logon ko banking se jodgaye ke sabase bade abhiyaan kii badakismati yah he ki vah sarkaar ke niti romaanch kaa shikaar ho kar daagi ho gaya
 The confidence of common people on banking has been deeply hurt
 loktantr main janata ajatshatru hoti he
 It also digests the failures of governments
 nitiyon ko paardarshee hona chahie
 Will the government, on the first anniversary, want to share the results of the investigation of banking operations and public money during demonetisation? The rule of learning from mistakes is not reserved only for human beings, what is the harm if Almighty governments also take advice? america raashtrapati baraak obama ne pushti kii he ki taliban pramukh mullah akhtar mansoor america hamale main maaraa gaya he
