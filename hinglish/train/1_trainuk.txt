 These are the circumstances in which a leader considers himself to be synonymous with democracy
 pehle vah ummid jagaata he, phir apni naakaamiyaan loktantr par thopata he or phir ant main immergency lagaataa he- ye alag baat he ki ant main wo bhi maaraa hi jaataa he
 But let us not repeat this mistake of history - for this it is necessary to constantly keep an eye on our democracy, always test your leaders
 yah sach he ki immergency kii pehali chot ke saath vah saham kar chup ho gai
 But before and after the Emergency, this soi-soi world had taken such action, which made the powers tremble
 jaise 1975 ke desh ko yaqiin nahin tha ki indira gandhi immergency laga dengi vaise hi 1971 kii indira gandhi ne sochaa nahin hoga ki ye desh ek din unka taj oochaal degaa unka takht gira degaa
 The silent revolution of 1977 created a wonderful view of the world's democratic history
 ye alag baat he ki mahaj teen saal ke bheetar us janakranti ke saath uske netaaon ne dhokhaa kiya
 If one of the biggest responsible people of that fraud is remembering that threat of Emergency again, then it may have its own political despair, but it is also true of the times
 is baat ke baavjood ki in chalis barason main hindustan kachhue se khargosh ban chukaa he or media apni dainik yaa saptahik lay ko peeche chhodkar bilkul choubees ghante chalane vaali aisi chakki ban chukaa he, jisamen duniya pisati rahati he or khabaren nikalati rahati hai, ham ek zyaada bekabar or asurakshit mulk hai
 The middle class who care for everyone, care for the neighborhood, and take care of the country and the world as their own, is over and replaced with an aggressive consumer class who are only ready to eat, drink and wear Thinks and does not allow any kind of violence, irresponsibility and injustice to fall on his skin
 isi daur main media par puunji kaa kabza pehle se kahin zyaada majboot he or samaantar awaazen pehle se zyaada dabi hui hai
 At such a time, patriotism means a desire to be strong in the world, development means prosperity for some people and leadership means a statement made in an aggressive tone
 tippaniyan In this era of thoughtlessness, such a personification is starting again in which neither proper criticism nor disagreement is in place
 loktantric sansthaaen yaa to khatm kii ja rahi hai yaa bemaani banaai ja rahi hai
 dalit-adivasis and minorities are constantly being sidelined and no one is ready to see the terrible figures of suicide and poverty
 yahi vah halaat hote hai jisamen koi netaa khud ko loktantr kaa paryaay samajhane lagata he
 First, he raises hope, then imposes his failures on democracy and then finally imposes emergency - it is a different matter that in the end he too is killed
 lekin itihaas kii is galati ko ham na doharaaen- iske liye zaruri he ki apane loktantr par lagaataar nazar rakhen, apane netaaon ke hameshaa imtihaan lete rahen

 Despite the fact that in these forty years, Hindustan has become a rabbit from the turtle and the media has left behind its daily or weekly rhythm and has become a twenty-four-hour-old mill in which the world keeps grinding and the news is coming out, we a There are more uninformed and vulnerable countries
 sabaki phikr karne vaala, paas-pados kaa khyaal rakhane vaala, or desh or duniya ko apana farz samajhane vaala madhyavarg khatm ho chukaa he or uski jagah ek aisa aakraamak upabhokta varg paidaa ho chukaa he jo sirf apane khaane-pine, odhane-pahanane kii sochataa he or kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa, gairbarabari or ninsaafi kii dhul apni twachaa par padane nahin detaa
 In this period, the media is stronger than ever before and the parallel voices are more suppressed than before
 aise samay main deshbhakti kaa matlab duniya main taqatvar hone kii hasarat bhar he, vikaas kaa matlab kuch logon ke liye samruddhi bhar he or netritv kaa matlab aakraamak tevar main kii gai bayaanbazi bhar he
 The comments vichaarheenta ke is daur main phir aisi vyaktipuja shuru ho rahi he jisamen na uchit aalochana kii jagah he or na asahmati kii

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne isi saptaah assam main ek chunavi raily main daawa kiya tha ki koi bhi vaastavik bhartiya enarasi(nrc) main nahin chhutegaa, lekin ab jabaki enarasi ke liye daawey or aapatti kii prakriya samaapt ho gai he or satyaapan shuru hone vaala he, tab enditivi kii padtaal main bilkul alag kahani saamne ai he
 NDTV reached Ground Zero and found that there are still many people, especially the economically weaker sections, who could not claim for NRC, as the claim process is very complex
 duusari taraf, alag-alag muddon ko lekar pichley kuch dinon main 3 lakh se zyada aapattiyaan prastut kii gai hai
 Let us tell you that after the draft list of NRC published on 30 July 2018, the claims and objections have expired
 draft list main chute kareeb 40 lakh logon main se kam se kam 34 lakh logon ne naagarikta ke liye daawa kar diya he, lekin kareeb 6 lakh log abhi bhi chhot gaye hai
 NDTV reached the Muslim-dominated Barpeta district with the highest claims and objections and found that the reality here is something else
 hamaari mulaakaat garib tabake se taalluk rakhane vaale or lakadahare (wood kattar) kaa kaam karne vaale 58 varshiya indra bhanu majumdaar se hui
 In his family of nine, two young daughters were not named in the draft list of NRC and could not claim again
 isaki vajah yah he ki ve jab bhi sthaneey naagarik seva centre par daawey ke liye gaye, na to kathith taur par unki kisi ne madad kii or na hi yah bataaya ki ab aage kya karnaa he
 Apart from Indra Bhanu Majumdar, there are many families whose story is more or less the same
 ab inke bhagya kaa faisla supreme court ko karnaa he, jo enarasi kii monitoring kar rahaa he
 Let us tell you that out of about 3 lakh objections that have come in the last three days, around 1 lakh objections are from Barpeta district alone
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne assam kii baraak ghati ke logon ko aashwast kiya tha ki enarasi (NRC) se kisi kaa naam alag nahin kiya jayega
 He said, "I assure you that the name of any citizen of India will not be left in NRC"
 piem modi ne kaha, "mujhe maaloom he ki enarasi kaa apadet karne kii prakriya main anek logon ko ksht uthaanaa padaa he
 i am aware of this, but it is your sacrifice that the process has been successful
 hamane sarvocch nyaayalay se raahat pramaan patr, sharnaarthi shivi pramaan patr jaise kuch dastavejon ko naagarikta ke liye daawa karne waalon ke vaid pramaan patr ke rup main sweekaar kiye jane kii apil kii
 i am pleased that the Supreme Court agreed to it "
 lander vikram se chandramaa kii sataha se mahaj do kilometre pehle isro kaa sampark tut gaya
 But the courage of ISRO to reach the moon was not broken
 isro ne antariksh kii duniya main kai itihaas rache hai
 Today ISRO has made its identity in the country and the world
 iskaa shrey vikram sarabhai ko jaataa he
 Because of which ISRO was established and India has made so much progress in space science and has succeeded in big missions
 jaane- vikram sarabhai ke bare menvikram ambalal sarabhai kaa janm ahmedabad main 12 agast 1919 ko hua tha
 His father Ambalal Sarabhai was a thriving industrialist and owned several mills in Gujarat
 'cambridge vishvavidhyalay' ke saint jon college se doctoret kii degree hasil kii
 Vikram Sarabhai always used to inspire the youth
 sarabhai ne 1947 main ahmedabad main bhautik anusandhan prayogshaala (PRL) kii sthapana kii thi
 In view of his works in science, Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award was awarded in the year 1962
 unhen 1966 main padam bhushan or 1972 main padam vibhushan (maranoparant) se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 How ISRO was established Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was founded by Vikram Sarabhai
 bataa den, roosi sputanik ke launch ke baad unhone isro kii sthapana ke bare main sochaa tha
 This was not so easy, for this Vikram Sarabhai first had to convince the government as well as explain how important the establishment of ISRO is for India
 dow
 Sarabhai had explained the importance of the space program to the government
 jiske baad 15 agast 1969 main isro kii sthapana hui
 Let me tell you, apart from ISRO and PRL, they established many institutions
 'parmaanu urja ayog' ke adhyaksh pad par bhi vikram sarabhai rah chuke the
 He, along with other industrialists based in Ahmedabad, has played an important role in establishing the 'indian Institute of Management', Ahmedabad
 us samay unki umr keval 28 varsh thi
 Sarabhai was the creator and promoter of the institutions and PRL was the first step in this direction
 vikram sarabhai ne 1966-1971 tak piarel kii seva kii

 In recent times, units such as Special Cell and Crime Branch of Delhi Police have uncovered many such gun rackets which used to trade high quality sophisticated weapons
 hakeekat to ye he ki pehali baar in hathiyaaron kii quality ko dekh kar pulisavaale bhi chaunk gaye the
 According to the police, in any sense these are not less than the weapons made in the factories, just shortage, then the seal of the government factory
 export bhi dekhakar kha jaaen dhokhaadilli police ke kabje main aae avaidh hathiyaaron ko dekhakar pehali nazar main koi export bhi dhokhaa kha jaae
 It is possible that he too has the misconception of these weapons being factory made
 in najayas aslhon ko naa to kisi gan factory se churaayaa jaataa he or naa hi inhen kisi badi factory main banaaya gaya he balki hathiyaaron ke taskaron ne inhen jurm kii duniya main khapaane ke liye apane chote-mote addon par hi taiyaar kiya he
 Mouths are sold at affordable prices
 The superb quality of weapons proves that with the changing times, these tradesmen have become not only professional and professional, but have also started paying a good price to the customers by offering good quality goods
 dhandhebaazon ke paas 
 32 pistol, 9 mm pistol and
 30 bor kii pistal jahaan 20 se 25 hazaar rupye main mil jaati he, vahiin 
 The 32 bore revolver is available for 18 to 25 thousand rupees and 12 bore gun for 40 to 50 thousand rupees
 madhya pradesh se bhi aa rahe hai hathiyaarpulice sutron kii maane to kuch sarkari gan factriyon ke band hone ke baad vahaan se berojgaar hue logon ne hi ab avaidh hathiyaar banane kii shuruyaat kar di he
 This is the reason that now the inflow of such slums has started from many places in Madhya Pradesh instead of Munger in Bihar
 lihaaza is dhandhe par roak lagane ke liye sirf giraftaar nahin, balki aslhon ke puraane kaarigaron kaa punarvaas bhi zaruri ho gaya he
 The business of such weapons increased in gangsters is of course illegal, but like any other business, this business of illegitimate slang also depends on the mathematics of demand and fulfillment
 jaankaron kii maane to haal ke dinon main dilli or aas-paas ke gangstaron main aise sofisticketed kism ke hathiyaaron ke deewangi kaafii badi he or isi vajah se in dhandhebaazon ko bhi acha-khaasaa munaafaa hone laga he
 The situation has become such that now middlemen have started giving work orders to the weapons makers
 avaidh hathiyaaron kaa dhandha yani laagat kam or munafa zyada he
 The gangs involved in this black business associated with the world of the underworld have silver
 taskar sidhe gang ko bechate hai hathiyaravisheshkar arms dealron kii mileebhagat se yah kaala dhandha fal-phool rahaa he
 Illegal weapons and arbitrary price
 phir bhi asalhon ke bazaar main kharidaaron kii line lagi he
 Gangs trafficking in illegal weapons do not sell weapons in such hands
 baqayada inke agent hote hai
 Those who supply weapons to criminals of Delhi, arms are smuggled as and when required
 sidhe gang ko hathiyaar bechney main taskaron ko pakade jane kaa khatra kam rahata he
 Illegal arms are becoming a stronghold Delhi: The speed with which arms and weapons dealers have been caught in Delhi in recent times has proved that Delhi has now become a preferred transit route for dangerous smugglers
 lekin sawaal ye he ki akhir desh kii rajdhani dilli main aisi koun si baat he, jo hathiyaaron ke taskar police kii tamaam chaukasee ke baavjood yaheen se hokar apana maal khapaane kaa rasta dhundhate hai? to jaankaron ke paas is sawaal kaa bhi jawaab maujuud he
 Actually, Delhi is geographically a state which is surrounded by states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, as well as states like Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are not far from here
 ghani aabaadi or kai tarah ke mod of transport hone kii vajah se taskar aasaani se yahaan apana maal khapaane kii firaaq main rahete hai
 These things have turned Delhi into a big arms transit route
 dilli police jab bhi kisi giroh ko pakadati he, to usase baraamad hathiyaaron kii pradarshnee lagaati he
 But more weapons reach the criminals than the weapons that are used by the police
 chand saalon main pakade gaye lakhon ke hathiyaardesh kii rajdhani ab hathiyaaron ke saudagaron kii manapsand jagah banati ja rahi he
 In the recent few years, the number of tradesmen and weapons consignments the Delhi Police has recovered from here, itself makes a new truth statement of Delhi
 zyaada peeche jane kii zarurat nahin he
 In 2011, the Delhi Police arrested around 150 people with 561 illegal weapons; in 2012, a total of 1190 smugglers with 562 weapons were arrested
 jabaki saal 2013 main police ne 309 avaidh pistolls ke saath kul chah gangs kaa pardaafaash kiya
 The weapons of Madhya Pradesh are the challenge of the entire Delhi Police, Special Cell, a unit of Delhi Police which has been campaigning against illegitimate slaves for the last two years, where last year alone, 196 slaves were arrested along with 33 miscreants
 lekin aakadon main kisi tarah kii kami nahin aa rahi he
 According to the police, earlier the weapons brought from Munger were used in most of the incidents of loot and murder in Delhi, but now the weapon of Madhya Pradesh has replaced Munger
 vahaan ke taskaron ne nae sire se police kii peshaani par bal daal die hai
 Actually, these weapons coming from Madhya Pradesh are much better and beautiful in quality than the munger made in Bihar, and this feature of these weapons has started to attract the crooks
 najayas aslhon ke dhandhe kaa badalata trend police ke liye ek badi musiibat to he hi, magar har rose is dhandhe main aa rahe nae khilaadi police kii liye saradard sabito ho rahe hai

 media jagat se bhi sunata aa rahaa hum ki sansad bhawan bahut purana ho gaya he
 At the inaugural function of the North Avenue Duplex Flats under the aegis of the Housing Committee, Lok Sabha, PM Modi said, “the government has taken it seriously
 sansad bhawan kaa acchhee tarah se upyog kiya jaae, yaa koi or bhawan banane kii jarurat he
 Officials are brainstorming on this
 ' unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke 75 saal puraa hone par is kaam ko karnaa chahie
 There is less time left but it should still be attempted

 In such a situation, the Prime Minister is requested that on the completion of 75 years of India's independence in 2022, his resolution of a new India should include the expansion and modernization of the Parliament House
 rajyasabha main sabhapati em venkaiya naidu ne sansad bhawan ke 92wein varsh puure hone kaa zikr karte hue kaha tha ki saal 2022 main desh kii aazaadee ke 75 saal puure ho jaaenge or is avasar par sansad bhawan kaa vistaar or iskaa aadhunikeekaran bhi kiya janaa chahie
 However, the Prime Minister said that it has generally been felt that when the new session starts, mps have to face the inconvenience of living arrangements

 Modi said that as the houses are empty, it has to be done properly
 aise main vyavastha ko sthaayee rup se kaise viksit kiya jaae or badalte samay ke anuroop kaise viksit karen, yah mahatvapurn he
 He said that mps do not need more than a room for themselves
 lekin unke kshetra ke log kaaphi sankhya main aate hai or dur dur se aate hai
 Everyone who comes in has a system to stop at night
 modi ne kaha ki jagah ho yaa nahin ho, saansad unhen nakaar nahin saktaa he
 mps know how difficult it is
 aise main gat satr se is disha main kaaphi vichaar vimarsh kiya gaya
 He said that some buildings are very old, that need to be repaired periodically
 north aivanew duplex flats ke sandarbh main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki ise samay se pehle or dhan kii bachat ke saath puraa kiya gaya he or gunvattta ko banaaye rakhaa gaya he
 Modi said that this time a very good work was done in the Parliament session, credit goes to every political party, MP and Chairman of the House

 baccha 11 march se hi gaayab tha, jiske baad parivaar ne kai jagah par uski talash kii, lekin uskaa kuch bhi pataa nahin chalaa
 There is an atmosphere of panic in the entire area after his body was found on Sunday
 police kii jaanch shuru he lekin ab tak kisi aaropee kii giraftaar nahin ho saki he
 In fact, Devendra's 12-year-old son Nishant, who hails from Karavalnagar area, suddenly went missing on March 11
 denvendra ne use kai jagah dhundha lekin nishanth kaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 Devendra also informed the police about the son's disappearance
 police ne shikaayat par apharan kaa mukadmaa darj kar maamle kii jaanch shuru kii
 Meanwhile, on Friday evening, the police received information about the corpse found in a drain near the Karawal Nagar toll tax
 isaki soochna parivaar waalon ko di gai
 The search for relatives reached on the spot ended when the corpse found in the sack was identified as Nishant
 police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 It is feared that Nishant has been strangled to death and the corpse has been thrown into the sack to hide it
 nishanth ke pita devendra ke ghar paas hi zeus kii shop chalaate hai
 The whole family is shocked by the son's murder
 parijanon kaa aarope he ki nishanth ko ghar se koi bulaakar le gaya tha
 However, the police is investigating the case
 aasapaas lage sisitivi footage khangaal kar is baat kaa pataa kar rahi he ki shav kisne phenkaa or nishanth kii hatya kisne or kis makasad se kii
 However, no arrest has been made so far
 nishanth kaa shav milane ke baad puure ilaake main hadakamp much gaya he or aasapaas ke log dehshat main hai
 The fear that was there three years ago because of Baghdadi militants was in the people of Mosul
 khuda kii kudarat dekhie ki aaj usee mosul main iraqi phogiyon kii vajah se ab aatankiyon kii ankhon main dikh rahaa he
 Perhaps the wheel of time revolves like this
 tabhi to iesas ke aatankiyon se iraqi faujee thik vaise hi badla le rahe hai jaise unhone begunaahon par zulm kiye the
 In the same way, they are being dragged from their homes by catching Gireban
 vaise hi unhen oonchai se dhakela ja rahaa he
 Likewise, the gun is being pointed at them and you must have understood the story ahead
 aisa kaise soch liya tha in haivaanon ke kiye kaa hisaab na hoga
 If caught, it will not be with them what they did with innocents
 aisa kaise soch liya tha in aatankiyon ne ki jis tarah inhone logon ko pahadiyon se phenkaa, inhen na phenkaa jayega
 The way they brutally beat innocent people, they will not be beaten
 kaise soch liya ki inhen gharon se baahar nikaala nahin jayega
 Guns will not be weighed on them
 inhen daraaya nahin jayega
 Their blood will not be shed
 kaise soch liya ki inhen laaton se maaraa nahin jayega
 Gireban will not be caught and dragged away
 kaise soch liya ki inhen usee nadi ke kinare laayaa nahin jayega jisamen 3 saal pehle bekasooron cogoli maar-markarphenkaa gaya tha
 And they will not be shot by bringing it to its edge
 jitani sajaa di jaae, kam hogiduniya ke vajood main aane ke baad se ab tak shaayad hi aatank kaa koi aisa kunba guzara ho jisane insaaniyat ko is kadar taar-taar kiya
 So whatever punishment is given to them, it is less
 lekin phir bhi shaayad ye us dard ko nahin samaj sakate jo inhone masuumon or begunaahon ko diya he
 Therefore, as soon as these Iraqi forces came under occupation, they avenged the oppression of the Iraqi people
 ye usee badale kaa video he jo soshal media ke zarie ab duniya ke saamne aayaa he
 This one minute 45 second video begins with an operation to take out the terrorists hiding in the houses
 or ek baar pakade jane ke baad gussaye iraqi sainik laaton se inaki khatir karte hai
 These rocks are witnesses of the massacre, they are captured and taken out of their bases
 or phir inhen ghasitkar chattan ke kinare tak laayaa jaataa he
 This is the same place where three years ago ISIS massacred hundreds of people simultaneously
 tasviren bataa rahi hai ki iraqi sainikon ne aantkiyon ko oonchi or khadi chattan par laane ke baad unhen ludhaka diya
 After throwing down the terrorists from a height of about 30 feet, they were fryed with bullets
 dekhie jis pahari se is aatanki ko neeche phenkane ke liye laayaa ja rahaa he vahaan pehle se hi duusare aatanki kii laash padi he
 This terrorist also falls on his partner
 or phir is par bhi thik usee tarah goliyaan barasaai jaati he jaisi ki in logon ne begunaahon par barasaai thim
 ISIS terrorists are hiding in homes, where terrorists are being punished for their actions, many terrorists have been caught and kept there
 ye tamaam aatanki gharon main chhupakar sena or aam logon par goliyaan barasaa rahe the
 This clip has been shared by Mosul Eye on his Twitter account
 pehle bhi is twitor acount se mosul main jari jang se judi khabaren or jaankariyaan post kii jaati rahi hai
 a spokesman for the Joint Operation Command of the Iraqi Army said that the army and government are investigating the video
 haalanki abhi tak is baat kii pushti nahin ho pai he ki ye video sahi he yaa nahin
 The army has made it clear that action will be taken against those who violate human rights during military action
 pichley hafte hi iraqi sarkaar ne mosul main jeet kaa elaan kiya tha
 The search for terrorists continued, however, the Iraqi Prime Minister had also made it clear that some ISIS militants still held shelter in people's homes in Mosul
 jinaki khoj jari he
 In such a situation, this video released on social media is being linked to him
 haalanki sainya adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ye video farji bhi ho saktaa he kyonki kuch log is jeet kii vajah se mili khushiyon or aatmavishvaas ko kam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 And maybe this video is also part of some such effort
 haalanki human ritis watch ne satellite kii madad se is video ke lokation kii pushti kii he
 After which the Iraqi army was accused of violating human rights
 oktober 2016 main shuru hua tha sainya abhiyaanapako bataa den ki oktober 2016 main iraqi sena ne mosul ko aatankiyon ke kabze se azaad karaane ke liye sainya abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 And after winning this fierce battle for 9 months, the morale of the soldiers is very high
 jaahir he ki ve bahut khush hai or alag-alag tareekon se is khushi kaa jashn bhi manaa rahe hai
 Mosul had given up the freedom of freedom from terror, but because of the Iraqi forces' struggle on Baghdadi, today he has got an opportunity to take account of the oppression
 or yakeen maniye mosul ke log aatankiyon se ji bhar kar unke jurm or apane dard kaa hisaab le rahe hai
 By dragging and dragging the terrorists are being held in the streets of Mosul
 log aatankiyon par nikaal rahe bhadaskoi laat se maar rahaa he, koi ghunse se
 And who cannot find anything
 wo unke chehre par thook kar apana gussa nikaal rahaa he
 It is the Hadith of the same Quran and Rasool that human misdeeds are accounted for in this world
 jis quran or rasul kaa hawala dekar duniya ke is sabase khoonkhaar aatanki abu bakar al bagdadi ne khud ko khaliph ghoshit kiya
 And then by spreading the same Quran and Rasool instructions, in the name of Islam, he spread haste
 ab us haivaaniyat kaa hisaab-kitaab shuru ho chukaa he
 And the traumatic deaths that are exemplified in the world
 usee andaaz main bagdadi ke gurgon ko maut di ja rahi he
 But the terrible death given to these poor people is less
 bagdadi ko khalipha maanane se kiya tha inkarbeshaq ye maut dardanaak he, magar ye maut aapako bahut aasaan lagegi tab jab aap wo mautein dekhenge jo bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne begunaahon or masuumon main bina raham ke bantee hai
 There was a Yazidi among them
 koi isai tha
 Some Shias were Sunni
 to kai aise the jo bagdadi ko khalipha maanane se inkaar kar rahe the
 Baghdadi gave such a death to these people, whose date is not even mentioned
 magar har jurm kaa hisaab vahi uuparavaala gunaahagaaron se letaa he
 Taking the name of these, they kill innocents in the name of unrighteous religion
 iraq ke mosul main aatank se ye badla log sirf badale kii niyat se nahin le rahe hai
 Rather, one by one kick and one punch each, these people are killing themselves while mentioning the humanity they have gone through
 har jakhm kaa le rahe hai hisabkoi kah rahaa he ki tumne mere baap ko maaraa, koi kah rahaa he tumne meri bahan kii asmat luti
 Some are saying that you ruined my house and some are saying that you ruined my life
 tumne mere achche-bhale desh ko barood se tabah kar diya
 And they got this chance of revenge after a lot of waiting and waiting
 isliye ye sabhi apni huzzat tamaam kar lenaa chaahate hai
 Iraqi forces have given this opportunity to these helpless and destitute people in just 2 years
 varanaa to inhone aatank se azaadi kii aas hi chhod di thi
 And now when the opportunity arose, these people of Mosul took revenge all their lives
 gadiyon se baandh-baandhakar bagdadi ke in vahashi darindon ko puure shahar main ghumaya gaya
 The army, which is rotating the terrorists in a street, is stopping in every locality of Mosul and is dragging the vehicles dragging the terrorists
 or log inhen markar apni apni bhadaas nikaal rahe hai
 Those who are very angry are dragging the terrorists from the car and rolling in the streets, beating them
 mosul ke logon kaa ye gussa bataa rahaa he ki kaise aatank ke aakaa bagdadi ne bam or bandook dikhaakar inhen ghut-ghutakar jeene ke liye majaboor kar rakhaa tha
 As Iraqi forces are entering Mosul, the terrorists are increasingly being clamped
 iraqi senaaon kii koshish he ki in aatankiyon ko pakadakar unhen jail main daalaa jaae, magar logon main iraqi senaaon kii aamad se achaanak josh bad gaya he or wo khud aatankiyon ko pakad-pakadakar unase badla le rahe hai
 The condition of these terrorists after the capture of Iraqi forces is worth seeing
 dare-sahame ye aatanki apni berahamiyon ko bhuulakar unase raham kii guhaar laga rahe hai

 The 'khichdi' that was brewing in the Congress and Patidar leaders in Gujarat for the last few days is now burning
 gujarat chunaav kaa elaan hone ke baad se congress patidaar netaa hardik patel ko apane paale main laane kii koshish main juty hui he
 Negotiations were attempted several times, but with no result
 hardik kaa ultimatum bhi kaam nahin aayaa
 Now amidst the chaos, the Congress released the first list of its candidates, and the two sides got into a head-ache
 surat, ahmedabad or rajkot main donon pakshon ke kaaryakarta bhid gaye
 Now Hardik Patel's rally in Rajkot has been canceled again
 isse pehle 18 november ko bhi gandhinagar main hone valihardik patelki raily radd kar di gai thi
 Before the Patidars and the Congress jointly fight against the BJP in Gujarat, they muttered head to head
 surat main congress netaa prafull togadiya ke daftar main jamkar todphod hui
 Similarly, outside the office of Bharat Singh Solanki in Ahmedabad, Patidars and Congress workers demonstrated fiercely on each other
 khaas baat yah he ki marpet se chand ghante pehle hi congress netaaon ne munaadi kii thi ki patidaar netaa unke saath aa chuke hai
 So now the first list of 77 candidates is being released
 haalanki gujarat congress ke adhyaksh bharat singh solanki ne daawa kiya he ki party ne jo list jari kii he, usamen jaateey sameekaran ke saath patidaaron ko pataane kaa behtareen formula banaaya gaya tha
 In the first list, Congress has given ticket to its current 14 mlas
 vahiin patidaar anamat andolan samiti ke 3 netaaon ko tikat diya gaya he
 Apart from this, 20 Patidars, 6 Dalits and 8 obcs have been given tickets
 darasal patidaaron kaa kahana he ki congress ne tikat jari karne se pehle unase koi baat hi nahin kii or list kaa elaan kar diya
 Patidars of Hardik Patel are saying that the three leaders whom Congress has given tickets on compassionate grounds, they will not file nomination only
 ab pech jabardast tareeke se funs gaya he, kyonki ek taraf wo patidaar hai jinhen congress ne saadhane ke liye 20 tikat baante
 On the other hand there is Patidar with Hardik Patel, who got only three seats
 aaj rajkot main hardik patel kii raily ain vakt par radd kar dene se ye mana ja rahaa he ki kuch na kuch gadabad he
 It was believed that in this rally, it was to be decided whether the Patidars would stay with or against the Congress
 ab sthiti congress ke liye bhi vikaraal he, kyonki patidaaron ke bharose wo jeet kaa swaad chakhnaa chaahati he
 They have got broken in themselves
 ab takahardikpatel ne pattey nahin khole hai
 In such a situation, there is a tremendous battle along with suspense in the Gujarat elections

 Rajinikanth: Hindi should not be imposed
 Not just Tamil Nadu but none of the southern states will accept imposition of Hindi
 Not only Hindi, no language should be imposed
 If there's a common language it's good for country's unity&progress but forcing a language isn't acceptablepic

 modi ne kaha, 'yes ve can, yas ve vil du'
 Now the question is whether Modi will create history like Obama
 narendra modi ne pehle kaha ki congress mukt bharat ke nirmaan main sahyog den or iske baad logon main josh bharte hue kaha, 'main aapse apil karata hum ki jo main boluungaa, aap bhi vahi bolen
 'after this Modi said,' Yes we can do, yes we will do, yes we can do, yes we will do
 ' arthath ham kar sakate hai, ham karke dikhaaenge
 With this Modi finished his speech
 jis naare kii naiya par baraak obama america raashtrapati kii kursi tak pahunche, 5 saal baad usee naare ko jinda karke narendra modi shaayad pradhanmantri kii kursi tak pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 When the Modi Express moved from Hyderabad to Delhi, Modi shouted Obama's slogan, with full enthusiasm - Yes Yes Can
 obama ke naare ne 2008 main america main jaadu kar daalaa tha
 This mantra of victory was uttered by the heads of the youth
 dekhte hi dekhte puraa america obama ke sur main sur mila rahaa tha or bol rahaa tha yas ve can
 Yes We Can had brought Obama to the President's chair, now it will be seen whether Modi also achieves his goal with this slogan

 Just think, a person roams in seven different areas of the same city, with different names and different faces
 iske baad un saat ilaakon main wo saat ladkiyaan pasand karata he
 Then one by one he marries those seven
 or kamaal ye ki ek hi shahar main saat-saat biviyaan hone ke baad bhi kabhi kisi bivi ko usapar shaq nahin hua
 She was now eyeing the eighth locality and the eighth wedding
 par tabhi ek gadabad ho gai
 Somewhere it would have been Sayyid
 kahin shahzad
 Somewhere Ali would have become Saheil and elsewhere
 shaks ek, par chehre alag
 And every time the names were brand new with those new faces
 ye kab kahaan auki kaise apana huliya badal letaa kisi ko kabhi pataa hi nahin chalaa
 The game of this polymorphism was such that everyone got cheated
 par ek baar jab isaki asaliyat khuli to phir to shahar ke har ilaake ne ise pahchaan liya
 Real Name --- Shahzad Age --- 35 years old --- Marriage was a strange hobby of this cheater
 shahar ke har ilaake main ek bivi bananaa
 And to fulfill this hobby, he roamed different areas of the city with different names and faces
 saat ilaaka ilaaka ghoomane ke baad saat naam se isane saat shaadiyaan kin
 But its unhappiness was that the seventh wife got a little smarter
 duulhe miyaan kii harkaton par kuch shaq hua
 Then what was left
 isse pehle ki aathven ilaake main aathvin baar nikaah pard kar ye aathvin bivi hasil kar paata
 
 
 
 
 Poll opened
 or tab se ye duulhaa miyaan gaayab hai
 Now this time no one knows which new face or new name
 zaraa sochie
 Where it is proving difficult for many to have a marriage, in 10 years it has done 7 marriages
 ab duulhe miyaan kii chunki asaliyat saamne aa gai he lihaaza bhopal police ne bhi thaan liya he ki chaahe jisaki bhi doli yaa baraat ho, jahaan shaadi hogi vahaan ise dhundhenge jarur
 What do you know from the back of the fog? bhopal police isliye kyonki is duulhe ne saare gul bhopal main hi khilaae hai
 Seven wives and no one doubts that
 
 
 darasal syed urf shahzad urf ali urf sahil ne bhopal shahar main rahete hue hi shahar ke saat alag-alag ilaakon main saat alag-alag ladakiyon se shaadiyaan kii thim
 And see amazing that despite having seven wives in the same city, no wife ever suspected him
 vaise mjedaar baat ye bhi he ki bhai ne saat hi shaadiyaan kii hai ye saatvin bivi bhi isile bataa rahi he kyonki uske paas saat biviyon ke hi saboot hai
 Given the habit of the groom Mian, even if this figure crosses seven, it should not be surprising
 or to or kamaal ye he ki ab bhi koi nahin jaanata ki ye shaks he koun? kya karata he
 
 kahaan se aayaa he
 
 kahaan kaa rahane vaala he?shaadiyon kaa ye serial duulhaa bahut mumkin he ki nae naam or nae chehre ke saath aapke shahar yaa aapke mohalle main aa chupa ho
 So just be smart
 or agar aapako zaraa bhi shaq ho to fouran police ko khabar kiijie
 
 
 So that once the real in-laws are delivered to them
 shaayad puure bhopal main gum-ghum kar ye shaadiyaan karata phirata
 But the seventh wife of this vicious groom turned out to be smart
 tab kahin jaakar is duulhaa 007 kaa bhed khul sakaa
 But even after revealing the difference, his face is still covered
 yahi vajah he ki wo police ke haath nahin lag rahaa
 However, in view of his nature, the seventh wife is quite sure that by now he will have also finished the eighth marriage
 is shaatir duulhe kii aakhri yani saatvin dulhan bani bhopal kii zeenat
 Zeenat married her a year ago on 11 January 2013
 ye rahaa wo nikaahnamaa
 Now this Nikahnama is real or fake, let us tell you before you see this contract
 jo us baharupie kii ek duusari bivi ke saath kaa he
 But this anecdote is not here yet, the story of wives and deception with them is very long
 
 
 zeenat ke mutabik syed ne apni zyaadaatar biviyon ko apana naam shahzad bataaya tha
 After the initial investigation, it was proved that his real name is really Shahzad
 lekin jis naam se zeenat ko saal bhar pehle pyaar hua tha ab usee naam se use nafrat he
 
 
 Because it ruined Zeenat's life
 
 
 lekin zeenat akeli nahin he shahzad usase pehle 6 or ladakiyon ko apane jhuthe pyaar ke jaal main fansaakar unki zindagi barbaad kar chukaa he
 Zeenat, who lives in Farhat Abza, Bhopal, met this vicious groom when she used to go to the institute for studies
 do saal pehle shahzad aate jate uskaa peechha kiya karata tha
 According to Zeenat, he had no idea that a vicious vagabond hid behind Shahzad's naive spear
 jiskaa kaam bholi-bhali ladakiyon ko apane pyaar ke jaal main fans kar unase shaadi karnaa he
 And when his heart was filled with them, he would leave them and disappear
 shahzad kii inhen bholi-bhali baton main zeenat or uske parivaar vaale bhi funs gaye
 
 
 He won the hearts of all of them by saying good things and showing dreams
 or phir jinat se shaadi kar lee
 
 
 The secret opened when Zeenat opened a file sheet kept in the house
 us file main duulhe miyaan kii puraani karatuut band thi
 When Zeenat protested after knowing the reality, he started beating her
 
 Then started threatening that like i have done 6 marriages before you, you can also marry 8th
 zeenat ke mutabik ho saktaa he ki ab shahzad apni aathvin bivi ke saath ho
 
 haalanki is baat kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he ki usne aathvin shaadi kii he yaa nahi
 But Zeenat is very sure that he is still hiding in Bhopal
 par sawaal ye he ki bhopal main rahete hue bhi wo pakadaa kyon nahin jaataa
 Why were the earlier six wives or their housemates never able to find him? So this too has its story
 baat apane aap main hairaan karne vaali he ki ek hi shahar koi yun itani shaadiyaan kaise kar saktaa he? wo bhi is tarah ki pehali se saatvin bivi tak kisi ko kaano-kaan khabar naa ho to is saatir duulhe kaa ye raaj bhi saatvin bivi ne khol diya
 Actually, the groom always changed his face before tying Mian Sehra
 kyonki cheharaa badalane main use maharaat hasil he
 The groom never used to get his picture taken; this groom 007 who does seven marriages is so vicious that he never gets his picture taken
 taaki uski vajah se pakadaa naa jaae
 This picture could also be revealed due to seventh wife Zanit
 darasal huliya badalane main maahir is duulhe ko pataa tha ki ek hi shahar main rah kar itani shaadiyaan karne ke baad tasviren uskaa pole khol sakati hai
 So he always avoided making photographs by making excuses
 or sachmuch uskaa yahi hunar itane lambey tak uske kaam aa gaya
 However, for the first time after the poll was opened, a case has been registered against him in Bhopal Police
 zeenat kii shikaayat par police ne shahzad ke khilaaf dahej or dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj kar
 
 
 The place has started pressing
 lekin abhi tak duulhe miyaan police ke haath nahin lage hai
 By the way, the biggest problem that the police are facing in reaching this groom is that the police are not aware that in what form and by what name they are roaming the city
 philhal uskaa nayaa cheharaa kaisaa hoga? par is duulhaa 007 kaa cheharaa kuch-kuch is tarah kaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, you will again say that if you see this face somewhere, then immediately inform the police
 kisi or dulhan kii zindagi barbaad hone se batch jaaegi

 India Today TV has e-mail in addition to Michelle's handwritten notes
 inase janaa ja saktaa he ki viviipi choper deal ghotaale ko kis tarah anjaam diya gaya tha
 The master middleman of the deal kept these notes carefully with great care
 inase akatya saboot milte hai ki kis tarah parde ke peeche rah kar bichauliyon ne manmohan singh sarkaar ke vakt 3600 karod rupee ke contract ko moort rup tak pahunchaaya
 The contract was signed by the Manmohan Singh government in 2010
 mishael ke in nots ko italy kii police ne jabt kiya or baad main kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) ke hawaale kar diya
 These show that Finmakenica, the parent company of agustawestland, 5
 2 karod euro (373 karod rupee) kaa bajet bharat main deal ko anjaam dene ke liye ghoose ke liye rakhaa hua tha
 This bribe was to be given to those people in India who had the power to take decisions related to the deal
 fax or email ke jariye bheji jaati thim suchanaayenmishel ko finamakenika ne hi bharat main kaarobaar ke liye dalal chunaa tha
 Michel regularly used to inform his bosses in Europe about every activity happening in India
 mishael ke nots se pataa chalata he ki wo ek or kathith bichauliye gaido hashake ke saath bhi radd helicopter contract ko lekar lagaataar sampark main tha
 According to highly placed sources of CBI, all the information was sent through fax and email
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki mishael kii diariyon main jo tathy the, unki pushti CBI ne maaikel ke secretary ke jariye kii thim
 The secretary had typed some content himself
 15 march 2008 kii ek entry menmisholne bharat ke sheersh netao kaa naam liya tha jo sarkari padon ke alaava sarkaar se baahar bhi the
 It can be read in a letter- 'the driving force behind VIP is Mrs
 Gandhi, she will no longer fly in Mi-8
 ’ isamen congress pramukh sonia gandhi ke pramukh salaahkaaron main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan sih or ahamed patel kaa ullekh kiya tha
 Michelle has 1 for a family separately
 5 se 1
 Was asked to make a provision of 6 million euros
 saath hi ‘AP’ ke liye 30 lakh euro alag se rakhane kii baat kahi thi
 Michelle had not made it clear who the family is and who the 'AP' is
 mishael ne diariyon main jis ‘AP’ kaa ullekh kiya he wo ahamed patel ke bare main he yaa nahin, ye aspasht or apusht hi rahaa
 Mitchell's diaries reveal that perhaps six million euros to Indian Air Force officers, 84 million euros to bureaucrats and 1
 5 se lekar 1
 6 crore euros were given to a political family
 mishael ke nots se ye bhi pataa chalata he ki use hai-profile contract negoshiation cameti (CNC) kii baithkon kii andruni jaankariyaan tak rahati thim
 According to Mitchell's claims, he bribed influential people in India who helped dismiss Russian and American choppers
 mishael ne iske alaava nots main PMO, SPG, CVC or raksha mantralay ke adhikariyon ke sampark main hone kaa bhi zikr kiya
 a note dated 10 April 2008 can read - 'the presentation of the offer saw that the Russians were rejected on a technical screw, it was not an accident
 ’isse saaf he ki kis tarah dallalon ne videsh main baithe-baithe hi military contract hasil karne ke liye kis tarah bhartiya system ko vikrut kiya
 Mitchell also mentioned- 'we are deliberately and consciously trying to eliminate competition in this situation
 ’varishthatam jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki mishael ko baithken hone se pehle hi unke bare main jaankaree ho jaati thi
 If he sees any situation of bribing, then probably his 5
 2 karod euro ke baari-bharkam bajet se badi rakam kii peshkash karne main samarth rahata
 In the list of Mitchell's bribe, there is a mention of giving six million euros to at least 4 officers of the Indian Air Force
 inke naamon kaa zikr unke aadhikarik padon se kiya gaya
 For example- DCH (deputy Chief of Air Staff), PDSR (project Director Service Requirement), FTT (field Trial Team) and DG Maintenance (director General Air Force Maintenance)
 mishael kii diariyon main kathith taur par raksha mantralay tak bhi ghoose pahunchaana darj he
 AK Antony was the defense minister at the time
 84 lakh euro kii moti raashi sambhavat raksha mantralay ke kam se kam 5 varisht naukarshahon tak pahunchaai gai
 As well as CAG
 mishael ke nots main inke naam is tarah darj hai- DS (raksha sachiv), JSAF (joint secretary air force), AFA (adishnal financial adwiser air force), DG ACQ (DG Acquisitions), CVC (kedriya satarkta ayog), Auditor General (niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak)
 Another letter states that the family wants their agreement to be respected
 isamen ‘parivaar’ or 'samjhaute' ko 2
 8 million euros has been added
 10 april 2008 ko diary main darj he ki CCS (suraksha par cabinet cameti) ne 'hamaare saath samajhadaari banane kii disha main baatcheet karne ke liye pravaktaa niyukt kiya he
 In the letter dated 8 February of the same year, it was claimed that the chairman of the CVC was showing a desire to be agreeable
 'mishael ne ek jagah likhaa he- mentenance cmand ise sambhav banane ke liye sabhi takneekee muddon par hamaare saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 According to the top investigators of CBI, former Airforce Chief SP Tyagi invested 2
5 crores in real estate while in office
 tyaagi philhal agasta westland ghotaale main kathith sanliptata ko lekar hiraasat main hai
 However Tyagi has claimed that he had reinvested the amount he had got from selling his land
 vahiin CBI ko shaq he ki ye rakam tyaagi ko agasta ghoose ke taur par mili thi
 According to senior officials, the first charge sheet is likely to be filed by investigators in the next few weeks
 unka maananaa he ki deal main herpher ko sthapit karne ke liye paryaapt saboot maujuud hai
 Top CBI sources say that the focus of the investigation will now be on suspected bureaucrats and politicians
 india today kii ore se mishael kii diariyon tak pahunch or uske contate ke bare main report kiye jane par congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha he- ‘is maamle main karrwai karne se sarkaar ko koun roak rahaa he?’surajevaala ne kaha,‘jo bhi karrwai kii gai he wo upie ke kaarykaal main hui
 These include starting the process of blacklisting the company to confiscations
 bada sawaal ye he ki ab ye sab kyon ho rahaa he

 Sanjay Singh has written a letter to Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, accusing Sanjay Singh of 32000 tons of onion rot and scam in it
 unka kahana he ki isaki jaanch karwaani chahie
 He also says that if Ram Vilas Paswan does not reply to the letter, the court will be knocked
 pyaaj sadane ke maamle main kya hui karrwai?aam aadmi party ke saansad sanjay singh, susheel gupta or endi gupta kaa kahana he ki khud kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne loksabhaa main kaha he ki32000 ton pyaaj sad gayaahai
 What action was taken on onion rot? Also, whether any action was taken against any officer or only on paper
 yah ek ghotaalaa he
 When onion was lying with them so much, why was it not given to the states and the public at cheap prices
 sanjay singh kaa kahana he, 'aaj puure desh main pyaaj kaa gambhir sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 The public is crying over the inflation of onions and the statement made by the Minister in the Lok Sabha of the country inside the Parliament is very surprising
 ramvilas paswan ne jo loksabhaa main bayaan diya he jisko media ne dikhaaya bhi he, bataaya bhi he ki 32000 ton pyaaj sad gai
 Sanjay Singh raised the question, Sanjay Singh raised the question, what is the evidence that 32000 tonnes of onion was rotting in government godowns? Was she registered in the register? Does the government not have storage arrangements? If 32000 tons of onion had rotated, then obviously the onion would not be rotten in 1 day
 is pyaaj ko sadane main kai din lage honge
 If onion had started rotting, why didn't you give it to the states at cheap prices
 saath hi saste daamon main janata ko pyaaj kyon nahin diya gaya
 He further said that whether the government of this country accepts onion rot but it is not acceptable to bring it to the plate of poor man
 kya is desh kii sarkaar ko saste daamon main pyaaj bechnaa manjuur nahin balki usko sadana manjuur he to yah ek bada sawaal he
 Letter written to Ram Vilas Paswan says that a letter has also been written to Ram Vilas Paswan

 hamane unase maang kii he ki 9 disambar tak pyaaj hamen bhejie lekin sarkaar ne aaj 23 trek pyaaj roj ke hisaab se bheja or achaanak pyaaj kii supplai band kar di
 After all, where did the onion go? He also raised the question that why the onion was not given to the Delhi government
 is par mantri ji se hamane yah bhi poocha he ki kya vastav main sadi he
 It was shown rotten on paper and a big scam was done in it
 jabaav na milane par jaaenge courtage unka kahana he ki hamane yah bhi sawaal poocha he ki agar 32000 ton pyaaj sad gaya he to kya kisi adhikari par isko lekar karrwai hui he
 The government took any step
 kya isko lekar koi karrwai kii gai
 This is due to the wrong policies of the government
 saath hi unhone kaha ki yah pyaaj ke ghotaale ke kaaran utpann hua he isliye hamane mantri ko chitthee likhi he or unase jawaab maanga he
 If he does not respond, the CBI will also go to the court to investigate the entire case for investigation
 is patr ko likhane ke baad agar jawaab nahin aata he to is par aage kii karrwai bhi karenge

 The government believes that if the current state of the price of crude in the world market remains the same, then by December of this year, the subsidy on diesel can be considered
 philhal iraq main aae sankat ke kaaran kachche tel kaa keemton main oochaal dekha gaya tha or kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar prati bairal se bhi upar chalaa gaya tha
 But now the price has come down and currently the price of crude oil is 106
 7 dollar prati bairal ho gai he
 The government believes that the difference between the price of diesel in India and the price of diesel in the world market may be reduced due to the fall in the price of crude oil
 kuch dinon pehle tak ye antar 1 rupee 60 paise kaa rah gaya tha lekin pichley dinon kachche tel keemton main ai vruddhi kii vajah se ye antar bad kar 3 rupee 40 paise prati litre tak kaa ho gaya tha
 The government also believes that in the coming 5 months this difference will be reduced further, after which the price of diesel will also be fixed according to the market like petrol and it will be out of the control of the government

 When Candice started eating an anabolic steroid, she did not intend to have such a body, but she says that it is too late and she cannot stop
 documentry ke dauraan unhone jodi marsh ko bataaya, 'mujhe musculin luk ke liye badi bazuen, peeth, chaude kandhe or chotu kuulhe chahie the, lekin main kabhi mahila se purush nahin bananaa chaahati thi
 Because of the anabolic steroid, Candice's hair grew in her body and her clitoris (women's sex organ) became so swollen that it became like a male's genitals
 unhone khulaasa karte hue kaha, 'haa, ve ek inch tak bad gai hai or unka aakaar purush ke guptang kii tarah ho gaya he

 But even then, she does not want to stop using steroid
 ve kahati hai, 'mujhe lagata he ki aisa karne se phaayde se zyada nuksaan hoga
 If i did this, my muscles would be the same as before, but the hair on the face and the heavy voice would not return

 It is being claimed that this picture is the official poster of Galaxy Note 8

 madhya pradesh ke bahucharchit vyavsaayik pariksha mandal (vyapam) ghotaale ko lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay se kii gai shikaayat par hui karrwai jaldi hi saarvajanik kii jaaegi
 This disclosure was made by the Prime Minister's Office Director and Appeal Officer Syed Ikram Rizvi in a letter to RTI activist Ajay Dubey
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ne anya congressi netaaon ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi se 18 march 2015 ko mulaakaat karavyapam parikshaon main hui gadabadiki dastavejon ke saath shikaayat kii thi
 Ajay Dubey sought details of the action taken by the PMO on this complaint under RTI
 ajay dube ne buudhvaar ko kaha, 'unhone june 2015 main piemo se vyapam ko lekar digvijay singh dwaara kii gai shikaayat par hui karrwai kaa byoraa maanga, to pradhanmantri karyaalay ke kendriya lok soochna adhikari ne yah kehete hue byoraa dene se inkaar kar diya ki ise kai sthanon se jamaa kiya janaa he
 According to Dubey, he appealed to the appeal officer of the Prime Minister's Office
 dube ne apil adhikari se vyaktigat upasthit hokar apni baat rakhane kaa aavedan kiya, magar unki apil adhikari se 12 oktober ko telephonic coffrence hui
 After that, the Appeal Officer Rizvi has instructed the Public Information Officer of the Prime Minister's Office to provide the information required in 15 days
 apil adhikari rizvi ne apane faisle main kedriya lok soochna adhikari dwaara die gaye sabhi tarkon se asahmati jataate hue kaha he ki unki ore se jo tark die gaye the, ve soochna dene se bachane ke liye hai, lihaaja kendriya lok soochna adhikari abhilekhon kii samuchit rup se jaanch karen or aavedak ko nishchit samay seemaa main soochna uplabdh karaaen
 Dubey said that former chief ministers Digvijay Singh, MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, Kamal Nath and advocates Vivek Tankha and Kapil Sibal had given Prime Minister Narendra Modi an excel sheet related to Vyapam examinations and several important documents for proper investigation
 gyaat ho ki vyapam dwaara rajya ke medical or ejineering collejon main daakhile se lekar tritiy evam chaturth shrenee ke karmchaariyon kii bhartee pariksha yojit kii jaati he
 There have been large-scale disturbances in these examinations
 yah khulaasa varsh 2014 main hua
 After this, the investigation of this case was handed over to the Special Task Team (STF) of the police, after which the Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigated on the directions of the High Court
 ab supreme court ke nirdesh par is maamle kii jaanch kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) kar rahaa he
 Many accused, including former minister Laxmikant Sharma and many Vyapam officers, are in jail in this scam
 vahiin is maamle se jude 50 logon kii sandigdh maut ho chuki he
 More than a hundred firs have been registered by the CBI
 pakistan ke sainikon dwaara bhartiya javaanon kii nrushans hatya or pichley kuch dinon se lagaataar sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan kiye jane ke baad niyantran rekha (elosi) par donon deshon ke bich sambandh kaaphi tanaavpurn ho gaye hai
 Amidst this threat of war, a village named 'maidan Gali' on the loc is forced to spend every moment in the shadow of death
 darasal elosi par sthit yah gaanv itani khatarnaak jagah par he ki agar yuddh hota he to iskaa sabase pehle or sabase bura khamiyaja isi gaanv ko bhugatna padegaa
 Before the ceasefire agreement, there used to be frequent rains of mortar and bullet shells (cartridge kiosks) at this place
 or jahaan tak mail today kii ground report kaa sawaal he, uske mutabik bhi ye jagah behad hi khatarnaak he jahaan hameshaa dar pasra rahata he
 65-year-old Ghulam Mohammad, one of the hundreds of victims of violence on the loc, says, “the Pakistan post here always hangs on our head like a sword
 agar yuddh hota he to hamaari maut nishchit he
 Ghulam Mohammad lost his son in a firing that took place about ten years ago
 itnaa hi nahin apana ek haath or pair bhi usne kho diya
 In this village of a few thousand people, about 17 people have lost their lives
 sthaneey aankadon ke mutabik maidan gali un 82 ghuspaithiyon kii maut kaa bhi gavaah he jo ki chori-chhipe gaanv main ghusane kii koshish kar rahe the
 These villages fall in Pakistan's top post 'kopra'
 maidan gali main rahane vaale gulam mohiddudin ne bataaya ki maare gaye in ghuspaithiyon ko benaam kabron main dafna diya gaya
 Ghulam Mohiddudin is the person who has seen 1965, 1971 and Kargil wars with his eyes
 2004 main pehle to halaat itane bure the ki do yaa do se adhik logon ko samooh din main sadak par chal nahin saktaa tha
 Firing was done on them
 aaj bhi aisa akasar hota he or bekasoor log donon deshon ke bich vishwaas kii kami kaa shikaar banate hai
 Located 45 km from Poonch City, this village does not have a mobile network
 najdiki health centre kareeb 8 kilometre dur he
 In winter, roads are closed due to snowfall and people have to walk about 6 km to buy goods
 maidan gali ke bashir ahamed ne bataaya ki vah kai baar lmaji kii goliyon se bache hai
 After the ceasefire, the Government of India had decided to construct a 40 km long road from this village to Gulmarg
 sadak kaa nirmaan shuru bhi hua
 But two years later it is still under construction and that too under threat
 'bhai-bhai' postagaanv waalon ne kaha, 'dhanna or puraa gaanvon ke baad bharat or pakistan kii do post aisi hai jo ki ek duusare ke kaaphi kareeb he
 Both the armies have named these posts as brothers
 ab agar ye donon mulkon kii senaayen is tarah ke naam rakhti hai to phir yuddh kaa koi matlab nahin he
 'people living here say that if there is a war, then the first people will become its victims
 kai baar inhen nihathe or surakshit logon ko sena kaa gola-barood ek jagah se duusari jagah lekar jane ko kah diya jaataa he
 Not only this, the people of this village have to struggle a lot for earning a living in this unsafe environment
 yahaan rahane vaale sadik ne bataaya ki vah kaaphi mehnat karke kuch subjiyan ugaate hai or unhen behad kam keemat par bechney ke liye majubar he
 It takes a lot of money to take these vegetables to the market
 aise main bachat bahut kam hoti he
 Many people fill their stomachs here through NREGA (national Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme)
 is yojana main bhi unhen 100 din kii bajaay mahaj 70 se 80 din kii hi mazdooree mil paati he
 The road leading to Maidan Gali is the last road in terms of transport operations
 is sadak ko agar kuch nuksaan pahunchataa he to yahaan hafton tak na to khaanaa aata he or naa hi garm kapade
 For the past several years, there is no sign of development in this village
 desh ke har naagarik ke liye mahatma gandhi ne jis tarah swatantraaa andolan khadaa kiya tha, usee tarah ab vakt he bharat ke vikaas ko andolan kaa rup dena hoga
 This is to say of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mangalvaar ko nai dilli ke pravasi bhartiya centre main 'siio and starop conference' ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne ye baaten kahi
 Describing Mahatma Gandhi's freedom movement as unique, he said, "at that time every Indian wanted freedom, but Gandhi included people in the movement in such a way that every Indian felt that he was working for the country is"
 ab yah vakt phir aa gaya he ki har bhartiya desh ke vikaas or use aage le jane ke bare main soch kar kaam kare
 If we work together, we can overcome every difficulty
 yuva siio ko vikaas ke sainik kii tarah kaam karnaa hoga
 Work for the removal of poverty Industry Leaders In this episode, Modi further said that we have got many industrialists' sessions, but it is not possible to use all those suggestions in development policies
 jahaan upyukt hoga vahaan uchit kaam kiye jaaenge
 Along with this, industry leaders will also have to work towards removing poverty
 pradhanmantri modi ne government skims ko bhi industry leaders ke saamne hilite kiya
 He said that every citizen of the country is supreme for our government

 In the day-long talks between Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao and her Pakistani counterpart Salman Bashir to soften bilateral relations, the two sides felt a lack of trust in the relationship and kept in touch and worked to build trust
 i decided to stay
 raav ne vaarta ke baad ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘hamane vishwaas punarnirmaan karne ke lihaaj se pehle kadam kii yojana banaayi or meraa maananaa he ki pakistani videsh sachiv ke saath meri mulaakaat ne pehla kadam banaaya he
 'while India paid attention to cross-border terrorism, Pakistan raised issues of Kashmir, Balochistan and water dispute
 bharat ne haal hi main pakistan main taliban dwaara ek sikh kaa sar kalam kar hatya karne ke masale ko bhi uthaaya
 Nirupama Rao said that the Mumbai attacks have eroded confidence
 unhone kaha ki pune hamale bhi ek baar yaad dilaate hai ki hamaare naagarik aatanki hinsa ke lihaaj se samvedansheel bane hue hai
 The Pune attacks are still under investigation
 raav ke mutabik unhone pakistani samakaksh se kaha ki unki sarajameen se gatividhiyaan sanchalit kar rahe sabhi aatankwaadi samoohon ko nestanabood karnaa pakistan kii mahati jimmedaari he
 With regard to 26 / 11, India has so far agreed to take steps by Pakistan to bring the perpetrators of the attacks to justice, but indicated that in order to expose the entire conspiracy of the Mumbai attacks and punish all the culprits In terms of this, it is not enough
 bharat ne pakistan main aatanki dhaanche ke lagaataar bane rahane or pakistani kshetra tathaa pakistan ke kabje vaale kshetra se bharat ke khilaaf aatanki hinsa bhadakaane ke lihaaj se lashkar e taiyaba, jamaat ud daawa, hijb ul mujahidin aadi jaise sanghathanon kii nirbaadh gatividhiyon par apni chintaa jataayi
 In this connection, Hafiz Saeed's provocative speech was mentioned in Lahore on 5 February, in which he openly spoke of terrorist violence against India
 mumbai hamalon ko pakistan se sir uthaa rahe aatankwaad kii badi samasya kaa ek sanket qaraar dete hue raav ne kaha ki unhone in muddon par pakistan dwaara teji se karrwai ke mahatv par jor diya, jisamen america main david colman hedli or tahavur hossain rana kii giraftaar ke baad mili suraagon par karrwai shaamil ho
 During the conversation, Rao handed over three dossiers to Bashir, detailing activities against India by some people and groups based in Pakistan
 dastavejon main 24 naam hai, jo mumbai hamalon main shaamil hai or yahaan anya aatanki karatuuton ke sajeeshkarta hai
 India demanded handing over of Hafiz Saeed and some let members like Muzamil, Abu Hamza, Abu Kahfa, Usman and Sajid as well as retired Major Iqbal in the case of Mumbai attacks
 bharat ne indian mujahidin pramukh asif raja khan or iske varisht sadsy riyaj bhatkaal ko bhi saunpane kii maang kii
 a dossier also lists Ilayas Kashmiri, a top terrorist associated with al Qaeda and threats from India on his behalf

 Rao said, 'we said that it is the responsibility of the Government of Pakistan to take effective action to end the activities of all such organizations
 ’ unhone niyantran rekha evam antarrashtriya seemaa ke paas aatankwaadi ghuspaith evam sangharsh viraam ulanghan main badhotaree par bharat kii taraf se chintaa jataayi
 The Foreign Secretary indicated that infiltration had increased by 40 percent in the past year
 pakistan ne samgr vaarta ko phir se shuru karne kii maang kii thi, jo ki bharat ne mumbai hamalon ke baad se roak rakhi he
 But New Delhi did not support this, saying that 'the time is not right' and a proper environment is needed for this
 hafiz said ke khilaaf karrwai kii bharat kii maang ke sambandh main raav ne kaha ki pakistan kaa vichaar he ki vahaan uske bhaashanon ke aadhaar par uske khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 Expressing dissatisfaction, the Indian Foreign Secretary said that Pakistan has enough anti-terrorism laws under which action can be taken against the Jamaat chief
 said ke paanch farvari ke bhadakaau bhaashan se sambandhit kisi tarah kii sidi saunpe jane ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki isaki koi jarurat nahin thi kyonki yah pehle hi saarvajanik ho chuki he
 When Pakistan raised the issue of Kashmir, Rao told the Pakistani Foreign Secretary that India believes in resolving all pending issues between the two countries through bilateral dialogue in an environment free of terrorism and violence
 unhone baluchistan main bharat ke hastkshep ke pakistan ke aaropon ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki bharat kisi desh ko asthir karne main bharosa nahin rakhata
 On the water dispute, Rao underlined that the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 is the proper system to resolve such issues

 ’’ Abhineta and MP Manoj Tiwari has been made the President of Delhi Pradesh BJP
 nityanand raay bihar pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh banaae gaye hai
 Manoj Tiwari has been given the responsibility of the state president in place of Mangal Pandey, instead of Mangal Pandey, instead of Satish Upadhyay
 vaise to bijepi ke party samvidhan ke mutabik har teen saal main iske adhyaksh badale jate hai
 Last year the presidents of all the states except Delhi and Bihar were changed
 ab dilli or bihar main bhi isi ke tahat yah badlaav hue hai
 But for this change, let us know what are the reasons for choosing the names of Manoj Tiwari and Nityanand Raikay
 
 
 1
 Both states held assembly elections a year ago and the BJP is in the role of the opposition party
 yani in rajyon main agle vidhansabha chunaav chaar saal baad hone hai, aise main pradesh adhyaksh badalane se party ko agle vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke liye paryaapt vakt milegaa
 2
 uttar-purvi dilli se bijepi saansad manoj tiwaribihar seate hai
 Purvanchal has a fair number of voters in Delhi and proves to be largely decisive during elections
 isi vajah se bijepi ne manoj tiwari ko dilli main apana cheharaa banaaya he
 3
 45 saal ke manoj dilli main rah rahe bihar or purvi uttar pradesh ke logon ke bich khaase lokapriy hai
 With the victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Manoj Tiwari became an important face of the party's Delhi politics
 4
 It is being said that the agreement to make Manoj Tiwari as Delhi BJP President was formed even before the by-election of the wards of the MCD
 lekin upachunaavon kii vajah se pradesh adhyaksh badalane ke faisle ko taal diya gaya tha
 5
 manoj tiwari yuva netaa hai or inaki image bhi saaf-suthri he
 After becoming MP, Manoj Tiwari has often been seen with the people of his constituency and perhaps because of this he has also become the choice of the party high command
 6
 50-year-old Nityanand Rai is currently an MP from Ujiarpur Lok Sabha constituency of Bihar
 nityanand yadav jati se hai, aise main bihar ke yadav votaron main send lagane kii taiyaari ke tahat nityanand ko kaman saunpi gai he
 7
 bataur vidhayak nityanand raay kaa trek record bhi acha rahaa he
 Prior to this, he has won elections from Hajipur assembly seat four times in a row
 haikaman ne eemaandaar chhavi or lambey samay se party ke liye kaam karne ke chalate yuva netaa nityanand par bharosa jataayaa he
 8
 bataaya jaataa he ki nityanand raay ko party kii jimmedaari saunpkar alaakaman ne yuva votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish bhi kii he
 In 2019, about 7 statements of Digvijay Singh were made for the Congress, a statement made by the BJP and Bajrang Dal on Sunday, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh has often made headlines due to his statements

 iske saath unhone bijepi or bajrang dal par pakistan kii khufia agency ISI se paisa lene kaa bhi aarope lagaaya tha
 This statement of Digvijay Singh was criticized by BJP
 bataa den ki 2017 main aties ne avaidh telephone exange chalaane vaale iesai ke 11 sandigdhon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 The accused were arrested from four districts
 isamen bijepi iti cell kaa dhruv saxena bhi shaamil tha
 Sidhu had to explain that the party had made a big statement by Digvijay Singh on the massive February 14 Pulwama attack
 unhone kaha tha ki agar koi doosraa desh hota to pradhanmantri na sahi, grih mantri ko to istipha dene par majaboor kar diya jaataa lekin yahaan par jo koi bhi in masalon par sawaal uthaata he use deshadrohi ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu also came to the target after this terrorist attack

 Digvijay Singh was tweeting 'sidhu please explain to your friend Imran Bhai, because of that you are abusing
 ' ye bayaan bhi party ke liye afat ban gaya tha kyonki congress siddhu ke bachaav main thi

 Continuing the attack against the RSS in julyjuly, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is active in spreading terror in the country and all are under scrutiny for the latest terrorist attack in Mumbai
 Hindu organizations should also be brought along with terrorist organizations
 unhone kaha, 'main pehle se kahata aa rahaa hum ki desh main aresas aatank failaane ke kaam main sakriy he or uske paas bam banane ke kaarkaane hai
 During the assembly elections, Digvijay had said, "I have just called Sanghi terrorism, which i still say today, let me show the clip because Hindu terrorism never said
 jo log pakade gaye or ab chhot rahe hai kyonki prosicution or dephence ek saath hai
 Digvijay Singh had alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can do anything to win the election

 a few hours after Kejriwal met top officials of the Election Commission on the issue, the Commission issued a press statement emphasizing that it "did not tamper with eci-evms (evms issued by Election Commission of India)"

 During the program, Rizvi narrated an anecdote when Bangladesh's development was compared to Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne apane pehle press conference main kaha tha ki hamen paanch saal milen to ham pakistan ko sweden bana denge

 However, Gauhar claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very popular in Bangladesh

 The suicide of the model in Delhi has shaken everyone
 wo ek kaamyaab event manager thi, naam tha priyanka
 Beautiful and equally likeable of Bala
 tabhi uski jindagi main ek bijnesaman aata he
 The talk starts with love and then in six months, the two also get married
 lekin shaadi ke sirf mahinebhar baad priyanka ko lagata he ki shaadi karnaa uski jindagi kii sabase badi galati thi
 Just to correct this mistake, she takes the last and most dangerous step of her life
 ek maheene main hi boj ban gai thi shadiapani mehnat or lagan ke boote priyanka ne dekhte hi dekhte event management ke duniya main acha naam kamanaa shuru kiya tha
 She wanted to dominate the world of glamor due to these same qualities, but before such a thing was possible, love was knocked into her life
 faqat chah maheene kii mohabbat kaa anjaam shaadi se hua lekin mahaj ek maheene guzarate-guzarate ye shaadi uske liye aisa ji kaa janjaal bani ki usne khud apane haathon se apni jindagi kii kahani par phulstop laga diya
 Priyanka wrote the Suicide Note before telling the whole story in Priyanka's Suicide Note
 isamen usne likhaa, "mujhe pataa he gam kya hota he
 i also have a sense of happiness
 dukh or jajbaat kya hote hai, ise main acchhee tarah jaanati hum
 But my husband forced me completely
 nitin par mumbai main ek rape kaa cese darj he
 Little did i know that he would deal so badly with me
 wo iklauta aisa insaan he jisase mujhe dar lagata he
 a month after her marriage, she showed her demonic appearance and beat me like an animal
 or jab maine apane parivaar ke logon ko sab kuch bataanaa chaha to usne mujhe or maaraa
 i married Nitin only because he had expressed his love to me and assured me that he loves me without any reason and he will always love me
 lekin wo ab badal gaya kyonki ab vahi insaan mujhase ghar chhodane ko kahata he
 i ended my contact with my mother only to be with Nitin
 wo bahut celfish hai
 i thought love would be found in my life, but i got pain
 nitin kii maa kahati he ki usne kuch galat nahin kiya
 Nitin did not come home for three nights and sent me a message on Watsapp asking me to vacate the house
 lihaaja ab mere paas koi or rasta bachaa hi nahin he
 "pyaarpriyanka at first sight was as beautiful and vivacious, equally diligent in her work
 glamer or sho-bijness kii chakachaundh bhari duniya ko najadik se jaanane-samajhane ke liye baad usne event management kaa kaam shuru kiya tha or teji se tarakkee bhi kar rahi thi
 But eight months ago, the biggest turning point in his life was when he met Delhi-based restro-businessman Nitin Chawla in connection with organizing an event
 priyanka ke lajpat nagar vaale daftar main nitin aayaa to tha apana work contract dene, lekin haseen priyanka ko dekhte hi apana dil de baitha
 After this, a series of expensive presentations first started and then seeing them, the meeting turned into love
 pehle se shaadishuda tha nitinlekin priyanka ko tab pehali baar apane or nitin ke rishte main kuch ajeeb sa laga, jab use pataa chalaa ki nitin to pehle se hi shaadishuda he or use das saal kaa ek betaa samet do bachche bhi hai
 But soon Nitin promised to divorce his first wife and then the two became even closer
 priyanka kii jindagi ab ek khubasurat mode par khadi thi
 After six months of love, on January 6 this year, the two became friends forever through a luxurious marriage ceremony
 lekin is shaadi ko abhi ek maheenaa bhi nahin gujara tha ki jindagi ne aisa you-turn liya, jahaan se priyanka ke batch nikalne ke saare raste achaanak jaise band ho gaye
 Delhi's businessman Nitin Chawla, who was the first wife divorced for Priyanka, was preparing to open another restaurant in Greater Kailash
 or isi ke silsile main wo ek event orgenise karwaanaa chahta tha
 One day in April last year, he met Priyanka for the first time in connection with this event, but this two-day meeting turned into love
 nitin ne jald hi shaadi ke liye priyanka ko proproj bhi kiya lekin aadchan ye thi ki nitin pehle se hi shaadishuda tha or ek bivi ke rahete hue priyanka nitin kii duusari bivi banane ko katai taiyaar nahin thi
 In such a situation, Nitin had two ways - either he would forget Priyanka and return to his life or he would leave his first wife for Priyanka
 nitin ne doosraa rasta chunaa
 For love, Priyanka becomes distant from her own, she decides to leave her first wife and within six months Nitin divorces his wife
 udhar, priyanka ke gharavaale bhi shuru main priyanka ke is rishte se naaraaz the
 Even the conversation between Priyanka herself and her mother about Nitin remained closed for a long time
 lekin shaadi ke baad nitin ne priyanka ke saath rahane ke liye apane gharavaalon se alag dilli ke posh dephence colony main ek flats bhi kiraye par le liya
 But before things got better slowly after marriage, the story got a twist
 priyanka ke gharavaalon kii maane to ek roj nitin ne priyanka kii buree tarah pitayee kii
 In fact, Priyanka had gone out of the house with her friend without telling Nitin
 bas, ye baat nitin ko itani nagavar gujri ki usne priyanka ko buree tarah peetna shuru kar diya
 It was nothing short of a shock to the police who had complained
 kal to jo shaks apni mohabbat main uske saamne bicha ja rahaa tha
 Priyanka used to try to impress him with expensive presentations and surprises, he would suddenly be so dreadful, that Priyanka did not even think of dreams before marriage
 lekin ab shaadi ke baad jindagi apni sabase khaufnak shakl ke saath priyanka ke saamne khadi thi
 Priyanka did not tell anyone about the atrocities she had with him and locked herself in the house, but when a friend came to meet her, the injuries in her body caused the first time in their relationship
 Gave up ab baat ghar kii charadivari baahar nikal chuki thi
 Priyanka had knocked the family as well as the police to save her life
 shaadi ke pehle or shaadi ke baad kaa nitinlekin isse pehle ki koi donon ko samajha-buja kar maamla shant karwaata, priyanka ne khud ko khatm karne kaa kadam uthaa liya
 The process of fighting started within just fifteen days of marriage, it was now continuing
 yahaan tak ki nitin priyanka se lard kar uski khudakushi ke teen din pehle se hi ghar nahin aa rahaa tha
 However, the telephone conversation between the two was definitely happening
 holi ke duusare din yani 25 ko hi priyanka ne apana phone uthaanaa band kar diya
 On the other hand, the family members were worried about Priyanka and after this, on the night of 25, Priyanka's mother reached her flat with food for her daughter, but there was a painful story waiting for her
 priyanka kaa flats andar se band tha or kai baar colling bel bajaane ke baavjood kisi ne darwaja nahin kholaa
 Fearing this, Priyanka's mother informed the police along with her family members
 agle chand minuton main police nitin ke saath dephence colony ke is flats par pahunchi or taala todaa gaya
 Seeing the scene of Priyanka's bedroom, the ground slipped under everyone's feet
 priyanka apane bistar ke upar lage siling fain se chunni ke sahare latak rahi thi or uske paanv bistar ko chhu rahe the
 The police hurriedly took Priyanka's corpse out and sent it for postmortem and started searching the room
 pehali hi najar main police ko bistar ke paas rakhe ek teble par priyanka kaa likhaa ek suicide note mila, jisamen usne khudakushi kii puri kahani darj thi or saath hi darj thi nitin se mulaakaat ko lekar mohabbat or rusavaai kii puri kahani bhi
 The police first stopped Nitin for questioning and later arrested him for committing suicide for his wife
 haalanki itnaa hone ke baavjood nitin khud ko lagaataar bekusur bataa rahaa tha
 When the police questioned more people, a shocking stories of Priyanka and Nitin's relationship started growing
 aakhir nitin or priyanka ke bich kis baat kaa jhagada tha
 What was the real reason for the fight between the two, to which Priyanka left his first wife and Priyanka distanced herself from her mother? So when the investigation of the police proceeded, everyone was shocked
 priyanka or nitin ke bich anban kii vajahpulice kii maane to priyanka shuru se hi ek aaazaad khyaal or khushmijaaj kism kii ladki thi, jo apane doston ke saath ghoomana-phirana pasand karti thim
 But Nitin became very positive about Priyanka after marriage
 wo ab priyanka ko kisi se milane nahin dena chahta tha or isi vajah se wo usase apana kaam bhi chhod dene ke liye bhi kah rahaa tha
 Priyanka was not ready for this and this became a major reason for the estrangement of the two
 duusari vajah thi nitin ke bachche
 Nitin wanted to keep both of his children with him, but Priyanka was not getting ready for this and after this, Nitin was passing on a cold war

 islamic madrasa modernigeshan teachers association ne poocha ki siem ke paas chuttee kii katautee par vichaar karne kaa vakt he, lekin pichley do saal se ruke hue vetan kii phikr nahin he

 He said that if madrasas are for people of a particular religion, then there will be festivals related to that particular religion
 aise main unase tyohaaron kii chuttee karne kaa adhikaar chhinana thik nahin he
 On one hand, the government shouts the slogan of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', on the other hand, what does the government want to prove by taking such steps? Madrasas had the right to privately fix 10 holidays
 unhen katkar chaar din karnaa kaise jaij he?chand maheene pehlemukhyamantri yogi adityanathane farmaan jari kiya tha ki madrason main muslim samudaay ke tyoharon ke alaava duusare rashtriya tyoharon par bhi chuttee hogi
 Ejaz Ahmad says what steps the Chief Minister has taken to modernize the madrasas? They say that for the two years ie 2015-16 and 2016-17, we have not been given the pay scale from the Center

 unhen rajya kii taraf se vetan to mil rahaa he, lekin centre kaa vetan do saal se nahin aayaa
 Ahmed says that UP CM Yogi Adityanath should be concerned about how these teachers are running their home

 Two years' salary has been stopped by very few teachers, while they have also accepted the fact that they have not received salary for one year

 However, the final report is yet to come

 Aamir once again showed everyone why he is called 'mr
 Perfectist'

 The story of the movie Dangal is going on a lot, about a wrestler from Haryana 'mahavir Singh Phogat' and his daughters
 jinka naam gita or babita he
 The social aspect is shown in the story
 kaise virodh ke baavjood gaanv kaa ek pahalwaan samaaj se ladakar apni betiyon ko pahalwaan banaata he
 How the two girls later illuminate the country and their name
 gita or babita ke alaava mahavir phogot kii ritu or sangeeta do or betiyaan hai
 Many places have missed the climax of Aamir Khanfilm, it is shown that Geeta Phogat's gold medal bout is going to see her father Mahavir Phogat
 tabhi unhen ek sajeesh ke tahat achaanak kamare main band kar diya jaataa he, jisase wo final bout nahin dekh saken
 But this did not happen to Mahavir Phogat in real life
 film main dikhaaya gaya he ki coach nahin chaahate the ki gita kii safalataa kaa shrey unke pita ko mili
 But in real life, Mahavir Phogat has a good relationship with the coach
 gita final muqablafilm main dikhaaya gaya he ki final mukaable main gita haar rahi hoti hai or aakhri main paanch ankon vaala daanv lagaakar wo jitati hai
 But in the final bout of the Commonwealth Game, Geeta had defeated the opposing wrestler in a unilateral match
 film ko chatapata banane liye aisa kiya gaya he
 In the real match, Geeta completely dominated the Australian player
 gita ne emily ko ekatarfa fite main 8-0 se shikast di thi
 Geeta's rival wrestler was renamed in the film opposite Australian player Emily Banstead in front of Geeta in the finals of the 2010 Commonwealth Games
 lekin film main dikhaaya gaya he ki gita ke saamne australia kii anjalina thim
 Geeta Phogat gave India the first gold medal in 55 kg women's wrestling
 coach kaa naam badlafilm main gita ke coach ke rup main pramod kadam ko dikhaaya gaya he, jabaki games ke dauraan mahila team ke coach pyaara ram sondhi the
 In the film, the coach's character is shown negative
 lekin asal main wo aise coach nahin hai
 There was no rift between Mahavir Phogat and Sondhi

 But Geeta is wearing blue clothes during the film but the shade is completely different

 Once again, like Akshay Toilet Prem Katha, in his comic style, he has come on the big screen with Padman

 After this, there is an entry Sonam Kapoor that reminds Akshay, 'what on earth is Padman leaving flying? 'kahaan shoot hui he film'pedman' united nesan main shoot hone vaali duusari bollywood film he

 The video of a terrorist involved in the attack on French capar magazine 'charlie Abdo' caparice office has raised many questions

 Those who have never fought a war against black money in life, may not understand the purpose of this whole process
 ye kisi kaa paisa jabt karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha
 If money comes in the banking system, it does not mean that all that money is legitimate

 This is the reason millions of people have been put on notice

 The Finance Minister said that the next step of the government is to ban black money in elections
 jetali ne kaha ki jin logon ko kaale dhan se nipatane kii kam samaj he vahi bainkon main ai nakadi ko notebandi se jod rahe hai
 The purpose of demonetisation was to reduce the dependence on cash in the economy, to digitize, increase the tax net and deal with black money
