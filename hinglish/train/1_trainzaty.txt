 Why is he silent? ”during the swearing-in ceremony of the Fifteenth Lok Sabha, Bikaner MP Arjun Meghwal tried to take oath in Rajasthani language when he was stopped
 vajahah kyonki vah samvidhanik manyata praapt nahin thi
 Meghwal then raised the matter in Parliament more than a dozen times
 ve kehete hai, ‘sarkaar ne shiksha kaa adhikaar kanoon ke tahat paanchavin tak ke bacchon ko maatrubhaasha main padhaane ko kaha
 But where is the mother tongue in Rajasthan? They believe that young children will understand well in the mother tongue
 lekin aisa kanoon banane se pehle sarkaar ko rajasthani bhashaa ke bare main sochna chahie
 By the way, there are more screws
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne kah diya he ki rupye par ab ek or bhashaa chhapane ke liye jagah nahin
 But where are all the recognized languages still printed on the note? Listen to the Union Public Service Commission
 uski yojit hone vaali parikshaon main paper taiyaar karne ke liye uske paas jaankaar nahin hai
 Maharishi then asks, 'how are the papers of Jaipur and Jodhpur University prepared?' These screws are not so entangled in front of such a rich language, provided someone shows interest in solving
 600 kahaniyon or apni baataan ri phulwari ke liye mashr lekhak 87 varshiya vijaydaan detha (bijji) rajasthani sahitya ke apane 58 varsh ke lambey anubhav par thodaa bolte hai: ‘rajaneta hi sanvaidhanik ohada dilaakar is samrudh bhashaa ko bachaa sakate hai
 According to Detha, Rajasthani is fighting for the recognition of language in a foreign country like America, whereas in their own country, this language is alien
 yahaan ek or shikayati swar aakar judata he, rajasthani cinema kaa

 'well, even though the central government may not try to understand the language of crores of people, newspapers and local news channels have definitely understood its importance
 khabaron main rochakata laane or rajasthaniyon ke dilon tak pahunchane ke liye ve apni khabaron main theth rajasthani shabdon ko parosane lage hai
 ETV Rajasthan is broadcasting many programs related to Rajasthani language
 is channel ke pramukh jagadishchandra kehete bhi hai, ‘sarkaar ko karodon logon kii bhaavana ko dekhte hue rajasthani bhashaa ko sasamman darja dena chahie
 'mobile companies are also reaching customers in Rajasthani
 castumer care rajasthani bhashaa main graahakon se baat kar rahaa he to usee bhashaa ke gane, collartun or ringtone bhi khub baj rahe hai
 There is a need for the government to understand the language of crores of people, so that the leaders and the voters have a bad reputation

 He was just thinking about his parrot
 court kaa jajment kuch alag aayaa, baknar ko zamaanat nahin mili or court ne use hiraasat lene ke nirdesh die
 Buckner was not as unhappy with the court's judgment as he was about the future of his parrot
 vah baar baar uskaa naam le rahaa tha, phir washington county sharif ke secority afasar, baknar kii baat ko samajhate hue tote se milane ke liye baahar gai jahaan usne dekha ki tota ek ped par baitha hua he
 The crows surrounded him from all sides

 The parrot was taken special care of but was not ready to leave its owner

 Buckner was charged with drug and theft
 baknar apane saath apana paaltu rangini tote ko bhi saath main le gaya
 Buckner felt that very soon the court proceedings would end, the judge would just fine him, get bail and he would return home with the parrot
 baknar court pahunchaa, vah tote ko court room ke andar nahin le ja saktaa tha
 Before entering the court room, he left his parrot on top of a tree and instructed that he should not go anywhere

 com / t9qxec8bad — WC Sheriff's Office (@wcsheriff) December 2, 2016 Then Buckner arrived at the court, court proceedings started which lasted for a long time, the delay of Buckner's concern was increasing
 vah sirf apane tote ke bare main soch rahaa tha
 The court's judgment came apart, Buckner did not receive bail and the court directed him to seek custody
 court ke jajment se baknar jitna dukhi nahin tha, usase zyada dukhi tha apane tote ke bhavishya ko lekar
 He was taking her name again and again, then understanding the talk of Buckner, the security officer of Washington County Sharif, went out to meet the parrot where he saw the parrot sitting on a tree
 kauon ne use chaaron taraf se gher rakhaa tha
 They are also attacking, but the parrot was not leaving the tree after obeying its owner
 phir secority afasar apane saath baknar ko baahar le aayi
 Seeing this love between Buckner and the parrot, the security officer allowed the parrot to be taken to the court campus
 tote kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa gaya lekin wo apane maalik ko chhodane ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 When Buckner's mugshot was taken for police records, the parrot was also sitting on Buckner's shoulder, not ready to land, and the police had to take a mugshot of both
 phir baknar ke ek dost ko phone lagaaya gaya
 Now Buckner gave the parrot to his friend and spoke to take care until he returned from prison
 philhal tota baknar ke dost ke paas he

 berthde party kii mouj masti main agar 'berthde boy' kii maut ho jaae to aap kya kahenge? soshal media par ek aisa hi video bahut teji se viral ho rahaa he
 It is seen in the video that a friend who fell on the floor in a room is being beaten by his friends with kick and punches
 ladke hansi mazaaq ke mood main dikh rahe hai, paas main teble par ek kek rakhaa he
 After beating, the boy stands up a bit groaning and the video ends
 kaha ye ja rahaa he ki video main jis ladke kii pitayee ho rahi thi uskaa janmdin tha
 Friends beat him so much in the name of 'birthday Bump'
 'berthde bamp' kaa matlab he ki jiskaa janmdin hota he, use log mazaaq main halki-phulki thapki lagaakar janmdin kii mubaarakabaad dete hai
 Many people including Virender Sehwag, news channel TV 9 shared this video saying that this boy has died
 dekhte hi dekhte, hajaaron or logon ne bhi is video ko share kar liya or hansi mazaaq ke chakkar main hui is maut ke bare main pratikriya jaahir karne lage
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the claim of the boy's death is false
 india today kii baat sidhe us ladke se hui or wo ekadam thik he
 On the tweet regarding this video of Sehwag, a Twitter user named Raghuraj Singh commented that this is fake news
 raghuraaj ne likhaa ki maar khaane vaale ladkaa unheen ke college kaa chaatr or use kuch nahin hua he
 After this, Virender Sehwag deleted his tweet
 is video kii sachai jaanane ke liye hamane usee raghuraaj kii khoj shuru kii jisane sahvaag ke twit ke jawaab main daawa kiya tha ki ye ladkaa usee ke college kaa he
 We came to know that Raghuraj studies in Kyrgyzstan, a country in former Soviet Russia
 hamane raghuraaj singh se sampark karne kii koshish kii lekin unhone hamaare massej kaa jawaab nahin diya
 But on Raghuraj's Facebook profile, we got a group photo, in which all the people studying in the same college with Raghuraj were present
 inhen main se ek vyakti tha deepak anjana
 These people study in a college in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan
 hamane deepak anjana se sampark kiya or hamaari unase baatcheet ho gai
 Deepak admitted that the boy being beaten in the viral video is his partner
 lekin uske maut kii khabar saraasar galat he
 With the help of Deepak, we also spoke directly to the boy whose death is claimed by many people
 unhone bataaya ki ye ghatana disambar 2018 kii he, jab unka janmdin tha or doston ne unke saath aisa kiya tha
 Ever since the video has gone viral with the news of his death, he is under a lot of tension, as it is being investigated in college too
 unki pahchaan ko saarvajanik nahin karne ke unke anurodh par ham unka or unke college kaa naam jaahir nahin kar rahe hai
 The boy who had beaten himself had also told people on his behalf on social media that the news of death was baseless
 is video ke maamle main virendra sahvaag or duusare log bhale hi dhokhaa kha gaye hon
 But there is no doubt that such a joke is not only dangerous but can also prove to be fatal

 In this match, in the 16th over of the Delhi Capitals innings, fast bowler Jofra Archer hit the ball but the bells did not fall

 The bowler was Jofra Archer

 iske baad jophra archer ne 150 KMPH kii raftaar se over kaa aakhri gend daalaa or wo stump ko chhukar nikal gai, jiske baad bels kii batti to jali lekin bels nahin giri
 The same thing happened on Dhawal's ball
 
 
 ipel main yah pehali baar nahin he jab wicket par lagane ke baad bhi bels na giri hon
 Earlier on this ground, Rajasthan bowler Dhawal Kulkarni was hit on the stump and the bails did not fall
 darasal, ipel 12 ke 21wein match rajasthan royles (RR) or kolkata nite rides (KKR) ke bich jaipur ke savai maansingh stadium main hi khelaa gaya tha

 This season's 12th match Mahendra Singh Dhoni was bowled by Jofra Archer of Rajasthan Royals
 lekin, bels ke stamps se nahin girane ke kaaran unhen jeevandaan mil gaya
 It is interesting that he did not even open his account at that time

 On the fourth ball of that over, something happened that all were taken aback
 dhoni bilkul rakshaatmak the, lekin gend ludhakti hui unke stump main ja lagi
 Dhoni was lucky that the bells did not fall
 dhoni ke thro par ranout hone se bache the rahulipiel ke maujuuda sijan main chennai super kings (CSK) or kings ilevan punjab (KXIP) ke bich ek mukaable ke dauraan dhoni ne keel rahul ko ran out kiya tha
 But, the ball did not fall despite being hit on the stump
 rabindra jadeja kii gend ko keel rahul ne on said kii taraf dhakel kar single lenaa chaha or krij se baahar nikal gaye, tabhi wicket ke peeche dhoni ne chaturaai or furti kaa parichay dete hue gend stump par maar di
 Dhoni's throw hit the stumps but the bells did not fall below the stumps
 gend jaise hi stamps se takaraai to bels jal uthi magar stamps se neeche nahin giri
 In such a situation, after this sentence on Monday, now cricket lovers have started talking in favor of giving the batsman out after the ball has been hit

 neshnal company lau apillet tribunel (NCLAT) ne phir is baat par jor diya he ki arikson agar yah chaahati he reliance communications (rcom) ke khilaaf inasolvency yani diwalia kii prakriya ko aage badhaayaa jaae to use company se mili 576 karod rupee waapas karne honge
 Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay, Chairperson of NCLAT, said, "why should one party get money and other lenders be upset and why should banks be upset?" Why should the Indian economy withstand it? ' The Bench said that it will either end rcom's bankrupt proceedings in the NCLAT or allow it to proceed as per law
 is masale par agali sunwaayee ab 30 april ko hogi
 Significantly, in February, rcom requested NCLAT not to stay the insolvency proceedings against it but to pursue it as it was unable to repay the loan of its lenders
 tribunel ne yah paaya ki yadi arcom ke khilaaf inasolvency kii prakriya ko aage badhaayaa jaataa he to vah eriction ko khud ko mili 550 karod rupee (byaaj sahit 576 karod rupee) company ko waapas karnaa hoga, kyonki karjadaataaon ko karj praathamikta suchi ke aadhaar par waapas kii jaaegi
 On March 15, 2018, the Mumbai Bench of NCLT accepted the insolvency petition filed by Ericsson against Reliance Communications and its two subsidiaries
 gat 1 farvari ko arcom ne kaha tha ki vah karjadharakon ko karj waapas nahin kar paa rahi isliye inasolvency kii kaarywah ko chunane kaa company ne nirnay liya he
 Subsequently, on February 4, the tribunal said that no one can sell assets of rcom or transfer to any third party until further orders
 gat 18 march ko reliance communications (arcom) ne sweden kii doorsanchaar upkaran banane vaali company arikson ko 550 karod (byaaj sahit 576 karod rupee) kaa bhugtan kar diya tha
 Anil Ambani has paid this money from his elder brother Mukesh Ambani
 agar company aisa karne main vifal rahati he to arcom ke chairman anil ambani ko 3 maheene jail kii sajaa kaatani pad sakati thi
 In such a situation, elder brother Mukesh Ambani came for help
 bade bhai kii madad se anil ambani bakaayaa chukaa kar giraftaar se to batch gaye hai, lekin sach to yah he ki aage unki dikkatein aasaani se kam hone vaali nahin hai
 The total debt burden on the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) was Rs 1,03,158 crore till the end of the last financial year i
e
 March, 2018 and the interest liability on it was also close to Rs 10 thousand crore

 In Patna, the capital of Bihar, the common people are struggling with water logging problem, but the speech war between Union Minister Giriraj Singh and Janata Dal United (JDU) is not taking the name
 haalanki ab lagata he ki janata dal united (JDU) ke netaaon ne giriraaj (giriraj Singh)ke har twit or bayaan kaa jawaab dene kii thaan lee he
 While Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that 'tali Kaptaon ko Bala Bhi Karti Kiya', then in Nitish's cabinet, Building Minister Ashok Chaudhary said that Giriraj is all just to remain in the headlines
 vahiin party ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki chandan tikaa laga lene se koi netaa nahin ho jaataa or kya giriraaj singh nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke pairon kii dhul bhi hai? sanjay ne kaha ki giriraaj singh ek baar bhi pani main fanse logon kii sud lene nahin gayi
 It is clear from the statement of Janata Dal United leaders that they feel that Giriraj's statement is not to be ignored and they will have to answer in their style
 is bich bhaajapa party ke varisht netaa or mantri nand kishor yadav ne mana ki is tu tu main main kii filhal koi zarurat nahin thi or sabko filhal raahat or bachaav kaary par dhyaan dena chahie
 Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, in a statement, quipped on the whole issue, saying that in the dog-cat fight of BJP and JDU, the people of the state are suffering huge losses

 gangs of shekhavati kaa gangvaar ek imotional waar rahaa he, jiskaa sabase bada kirdaar anandapal singh banakar ubhara tha
 Till now dozens of people have died in this gang war
 ye gangster kabhi aapas main dost hua karte the, lekin bijness ke silsile main gang ke do logon ke bich ladaai hui or apane-apane karibiyon kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye duusare gang ke gurgon kii laashen ye giraate rahete hai
 Whenever there is a gang war between these miscreants
 kisi apane ko inhone khoyaa or phir uski chita par badla lene kii kasam ke saath duusare gang par hamalaa bhi kiya
 Started in the liquor business Ranjishasal In 2005, Raju Chashmi, Balveer Banooda and Gopal Phogawat, who hail from Shekhawati, together got a liquor shop in Jeen Mata
 isi kaarobaar main aage hue jhagade ke chalate raju theth or balvir banooda ke bich vivaad ho gaya tha
 At that time, the entire work of the shop was seen by Gopal, the brother-in-law of Banuda
 donon ke bich ranjish itani bad gai ki raju theth ne saathiyon ke saath milakar balvir banooda ke saale gopal kii peet petakar hatya kar di thi
 The game of revenge on the pyre started with a vengeance between the two groups
 apane saale kii hatya ke baad balvir banooda ne uski chita par raju theth se badla lene kii kasam khai
 Balveer Banooda was weakened by his separation from Raju typical
 gut ko majboot karne ke liye usne nagaur ke apane saathi anandapal kii madad lee
 Then Anandpal was preparing for the job of teacher and army after studying
 behad nidar anandapal ke saath milakar usne sharaab or mining kaa kaarobaar shuru kiya or isi dauraan badale kii aag ko bhi usne jinda rakhane ke liye gut ko majboot bana liya
 Balveer Banooda was planning to take revenge on Raju typical's gang from the peace time Fogawat had formed between the two gangs, but Gopal Phogawat, Raju typical's special friend, extinguished him
 raajnneetik taur par gopal phogawatt kii shekhavati main acchhee saakh thi
 It was Gopal Phogawat who tried to make peace among the factions in the area
 usneraaju theth ore balvir banooda ke aria bhi baant die the, lekin uskaa jhukaav raju theth kii ore zyada tha
 Balveer Banuda had more problems than this
 phogawat ko chalni kar banooda ne puri kii aadhi kasamaisi dauraan 2006 kii june maheene main raju theth ke khaas aadmi gopal phogawat kii mukhabiri use mili
 He finds out that he is going alone to a teller's shop in Sikar's market
 mauka dekhakar banooda gang ne gopal phogawat ko saare bazaar goliyon se bhun diya
 In this way, half the promise of Gopal Banuda was fulfilled, but it was left for him to kill Raju typical
 phogawat kii maut se badale samikarngopal phogawat kii hatya kii is kshetra ke saare sameekaran badal die
 In his last visit, Raju typical had vowed to eliminate Balvir Banooda
 apane saathi or khaas dost ko khone ke baad raju theth ke jivan kaa bas ek hi makasad rah gaya tha or vah tha balvir banooda ko khatm karnaa
 However, Raju typical knew that it was not easy for him to be with Anandpal
 vah maukey kaa intjaar karne laga
 Meanwhile, the two groups continued to attack each other's rogues
 duusare dhandhon or hatya ke kai maamalon kii vajah se ab police bhi inke peeche lagi hui thi
 So the gangsters of both gangs went underground for a few years
 2012 main phir sulgi badale kii augsaal 2012 main jab raju theth, anandapal or balvir banooda giraftaar ho gaye, to badale kii aag phir se sulagane lagi
 Balveer Banooda entrusted his special man Subhash Baral to kill Raju typical in Sikar jail
 subhash baraal tab sikar jail main hi band tha, vahiin usko hathiyaar bhijwaaye gaye
 On 26 January 2013, Subhash Baral attacked Raju Adarsh, but luckily the bullet hit Raju Adarsh's jaw and he survived
 raju theth ne is tarah puri apni kasamgel main apane upar hue is hamale se raju theth tilamila gaya
 Now it was very important for him to take revenge on Balveer Banooda and Anandpal
 raju theth ke jail main aane ke baad usne apane bhai omprakash urf oma ko gang kaa commander bana diya tha
 Meanwhile, the gang of Balveer Banuda and Anandpal was lodged in Bikaner Jail
 sanyog se omprakash theth kaa saalaa jaiprakash or uskaa dost ramprakash bhi bikaner jail main hi band the
 Both were sent weapons in jail on Raju Aadmi's plan and on 24 July 2014, Balvir Banooda and Anandpal were attacked in Bikaner Jail, in which Balvir Banooda was killed
 phir anandapal ne khai raju theth ko maarane kii kasamais tarah raju theth kii ek kasam to puri ho gai thi, lekin apane ajij dost kii maut ke baad anandapal ne raju theth ko maarane kii kasam khai
 Anandpal's gang went to his brother Vicky
 vicky kuch samay pehle hi hatya ke ek maamle main parole se faraar hua tha, jabaki raju theth ke gang kaa sanchaalan uskaa bhai omprakash kar rahaa tha
 Then they came to know that both the groups had given betel nut to each other
 raju theth ne bikaner ke ramkishan sihaag hatya maamle main faraar badmaash shankar ko anandapal kii supaari di he
 The story of the gang war between these miscreants is a story of more revenge than mutual rivalry and business
 ek aisi jang he, jisamen hatya kaa badla hatya ke alaava kuch bhi nahin he
 This is such an endless series, when all the characters will not be eliminated, the bullets will not stop
 phir hui ladi don anuraadhaa kii dhamaakedaar entrirajasthan ke is gangvaar ne pehali baar ladi don kaa kahar bhi dekha
 Lady Don Anuradha Chaudhary, an MBA student who spoke several languages, studied in English school, came close to Anandpal and upon seeing the crime came under control
 ek vyapari ke apharan ke dauraan nakebandi main anuraadhaa pakadi gai or philhal jaipur ke central jail main band he
 He is facing dozens of serious cases like murder, kidnapping and assault
 jurm kii duniya main anuraadhaa kii thi alag hi haisiyatgines pant ke saath tii shart or shart main rahane vaali lambii kad-lathi kii anuraadhaa kii baari-bharkam suraksha dekh kar koi bhi andaja laga saktaa he ki anuraadhaa aparaadh kii duniya main kya haisiyat rakhti he
 Anuradha, who hails from a large Jaipur family, is educated at the Sophia School in Ajmer and speaks English fluently
 lekin jaldi paisa kamaane or ayyashi bhari jindagi kii chaah ne anuraadhaa ko aparaadh kii duniya main khinch laayaa
 Anandpal became gang number two Anuradha came close to Anandpal Singh in Anuradha Sikar and by the time Anandpal Singh's gang became number two
 padhai likhaai main acchhee hone kii vajah se court kachhari se lekar aparaadh kii planning kaa jimmaa bhi anuraadhaa par hi rahata tha
 After Anandpal went to jail, the responsibility of the gang fell on Anuradha
 ek din sikar main ek vyapaaree ne anuraadhaa ko rangadari nahin di to vah uskaa apharan kar laa rahi thi
 On the way, the police had put a blockade and in the meantime his car broke down, which caught him in the police
 tab se vah jaipur kii jail main band he or sikar, nagaur, bikaner or ajmer main us par darjanon aparaadhik mukademe chal rahe hai
 Actually this ongoing gang war in Rajasthan has created fear among common people including farmers and traders
 saream chalati goliyaan or hatyaon ke daur ne police ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi sawaal khadaa kiya he
 Often leaders of Congress and BJP accuse each other of going to jail to meet these gangsters
 donon hi dal ke netaaon par aarope he ki chunaav main vot paane ke liye in gangstaron kaa sahaara netaa lete hai

 bhartiya cricket team shanivaar se australia ke khilaaf shuru ho rahi paanch match kii vanade maichon kii siries main bhi prayog karnaa jari rakhegi, taaki ‘vishwa cap team’ ke sthaan sunishchit ho saken
 The team is slowly getting into the color of the World Cup and as far as captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri are concerned, the 0-2 defeat in the recently concluded T20 series will not have any effect on the scheme
 siries kaa pehla muqabla 2 march ko hyderabad main dopaher 1
 To be played from 30 pm
 kohli ne bengaluru main mili haar ke baad kaha, ‘har team vishwa cap se pehle khud ko behatar karnaa chaahati he or ham vanade siries main bhi yahi kram jari rakhenge, lekin phir bhi ham har match ko jeetna chaahate hai

 lekin unki pratibha or akele dam par match main jeet dilaane kii kshamta ko dekhte hue team prabandhan antim faisla karne se pehle use kuch or match dena chahega
 Vijay Shankar's bowling is not so good, but due to the fitness of Hardik Pandya he will remain in the race to claim the place of second all-rounder, though Pandya will remain the first choice

 Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah are the first choice, allowing Kaul to get two matches to prove his ability
 lekin kohli or coach shastri ‘kor team’ main zyada chhedchhad nahin karnaa chahenge, kyonki siries main shandaar jeet hameshaa behatar hogi
 With Ambati Rayudu, veteran all-rounder Kedar Jadhav and Shami returning to the Indian team, the one-day series will be a completely different challenge for Aaron Finch and his players

 ye sabhi netaa bijepi kii sarvocch nirnay lene vaale sansadeey board ke sadsy hai
 After the meeting, party sources said that BJP can give tickets to leaders above 75 years of age but they will not be given any responsibility in the government or the party
 haalanki party ke ucch sutron kaa kahana he ki 75 saal se zyada umr ke jeetne vaale netaaon ko tikat dene kaa ye formula varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, shanta kumaar or bisi khanduri par lagu nahin hoga
 This means that the party can relax these leaders in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 sansadeey board kii baithak main 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaaon ko chunaav ladaane, rajyasabha saansadon or vidhayakon ko loksabhaa chunaav main utaarne par vyapak charchaa kii gai
 In the last 5 states assembly elections, the party had given tickets to many candidates who were more than 75 years of age, but had more ability to win elections
 party ne 75 saal se zyada umr ke netaaon ko tikat naa dene ke faisle ko karnataka chunaav main yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bana kar badal diya tha

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaajawaadee party ke bich gathbandhan hona tay mana ja rahaa he, jisamen congress philhal hissaa banati najar nahin aa rahi he
 This move of SP-BSP is not liked by Congress
 party ke pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar donon dalon ke gathbandhan se naaraaz najar aa rahe hai
 They feel the BJP will benefit from the Congress not joining
 prayagraj main ajtak se baatcheet karte hue raaj babbar ne kaha ki agar bina congress ke sapa-basapa ke bich mahagathbandhan hota he to isse sidhaa-sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hoga
 Therefore, both these parties have to decide whether they want to benefit the BJP or defeat the BJP
 congress pradesh adhyaksh ne kaha ki in donon partiyon ne madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan main akele chunaav ladaa tha, lekin agar yah congress ke saath gathbandhan karke chunaav maidan main hotin to bijepi ko or bhi zyada siton kaa nuksaan hota
 Expressing displeasure with SP and BSP, Raj Babbar said that it is up to both parties to decide what action they take
 raaj babbar se poocha gaya ki kya congress uttar pradesh kii sabhi loksabhaa siton par akele chunaav ladegi
 On this, he said that it will be decided only after the meeting of party president Rahul Gandhi with the heads of all the states of Congress on January 9
 haalanki raaj babbar kaa kahana he ki agar bijepi ko haraana he to sabhi partiyon ko milakar ek saath chunaav ladanaa hoga varanaa alag-alag ladane se phayda bijepi ko hoga
 However, the SP-BSP alliance may leave Amethi and Rae Bareli seats to Congress
 aise main in donon siton par congress kaa muqabla sidhe bijepi se hoga
 Whereas in the remaining seats, it will have to deal with the BJP as well as the Grand Alliance candidates

 While Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will give relief to the common man on many fronts, in many places he can also take tough decisions for the sake of the economy, but there is a constant talk of raising the income tax exemption limit
 philhal2
 This limit of Rs 5 lakh is being said to be Rs 3 lakh
 haalanki yah iskar chhot seemaa 5 lakh rupee tak ho sakati he, lekin iske liye jaruri he ki vitt mantri arun jetali apane dil kii baat sun len
 This demand was made in 2014, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who was presenting the budget for the fifth consecutive time in the Modi government, himself raised this demand during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki iskar chhot kii seemaa ko 2 lakh se badhaakar 5 lakh kiya janaa chahie
 He had said that it would benefit more than 3 crore people
 puri nahin hui he maangaus samaybhajapa netaake taur par jo maang jetali kar rahe the, satta main aane ke baad vah khud bhi abhi tak is maang ko puraa nahin kar paae hai
 Not only inflation has increased during the last 4 years, but also with the cost of living of ordinary people has become expensive
 apane pichley 4 bajaton main iskar chhot seemaa ko jetali aam aadmi ke liye 2
 Can take up to 5 lakh rupees
 haalanki unhone tex rate main katautee jarur kii he
 He cut the tax rate in the 2017 budget 2
 5 lakh se 5 lakh tak kii aay waalon ke liye tex rate ko 10 fisadi se ghataakar 5 fisadi kar diya tha
 Due to this tax exemption, these people either have to pay zero tax or they have to pay 50 percent of the current tax liability
 bataa den ki inakam tex act ke section 87e ke tahat tex chhot di jaati he
 There has been a demand to raise the income tax exemption limit, even after the government came to power, many times there have been demands that the income tax exemption limit should be raised to 5 lakh
 jetali is sarkaar ke 5wein saal kaa bajet pesh karne ja rahe hai
 With this, before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he has the last chance to fulfill the promise that he was making during the election from other parties
 is baar badhegi iskar chhot seemaa?ab ye dekhnaa hoga kivitt mantri arun jetlikhud jis maang ko 2014 main uthaa rahe the, kya vah use puri karte hai
 If Jaitley decides to listen to his heart, then by raising the income tax exemption limit, Jaitley will not only fulfill his own raised demand, but the common man will also get a big gift

 On August 6, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, 'I feel so angry at the name of cow protection that some people have opened their shops
 gaubhakt alag he, gau sevak alag he
 i have seen that some people who do antisocial activity throughout the night, but wear the guard's robe during the day
 maine rajya sarkaron se anurodh karata hum ki aise jo gaurakshak banate hai unka dogier taiyaar karen, 70-80 pratishat aise niklenge jo aise gorakhdhandhe karte hai jo samaaj sweekaar nahin karata he lekin apni un buraaiyon se bachane ke liye gauraksha kaa chola pahan kar nikalate hai
 And if he is really a coworker, then i urge him to do one thing, most of the cows are not killed due to murder, you die eating plastic, then you should at least stop the cow eating plastic, people stop throwing plastic If you get it done then it will be a great cow
 isliye swayanseva auron ko pratadit karne ke liye nahin hoti
 In all the two and a half years of debates in the context of cow protection or cow slaughter, the biggest and authentic statement from the government is that 70-80 per cent cow guards are fake
 ummid he pradhanmantri ab bhi apni is raay par kaayam honge
 We do not know what effect this appeal of the Prime Minister had on the state governments
 kam se kam maujuuda vivaad ke sandarbh main rajasthan ke grih mantri hi bataa sakate hai ki unhone pradhanmantri kii apil par farji gau rakshakon yaa gau raksha ke naam par dukaan chalaane waalon kii koi file banaai he yaa nahin
 Rajasthan's Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria can only tell what a Hindu post is
 ye kis kanoon se bana he
 Who is the constable of Hindu post, who is SP, who is SSP and who is DG Hindu post
 ye ham nahin kah rahe balki alvar se bijepi ke lokapriy vidhayak gyandev ahuja ji ne kaha he
 What law are Hindu posts made out of, or is it the law to keep a Hindu name? janata to bheed he or bheed tantra he
 It will be heard that Ahuja ji is provoking the public
 nahin aisa nahin kar rahe hai
 He simply said that the public is a crowd and there is a mob system
 balki ahuja ji kii is baat ke liye bhuri bhuri prashansa kii jaani chahie ki unhone yah bhi kaha he ki janata ko peetna nahin chahie
 There is a law for such a thing
 is garimamayi bayaan ke baad unhone yah bhi kaha he ki 'hamaare yahaan jo hindu chowkiyaan bani hai, un sabko hamane instrection diya he ki gau taskaron se kisi tarah kii marpet nahin kerani he, unako pakad karke police ke hawaale kar dena he
 'brownish brown praise should also be given for this
 ye unke bayaan kaa sakaaratmak pahalu he
 But i was shocked to hear the Hindu posts
 kya alvar police ko hindu chaukiyon kii jaankaree he ki puure mevaat main aisi chowkiyaan bani he
 Mewat is in Haryana
 alvar rajasthan main he
 Why did Alwar MLA build Hindu posts in Mewat, Haryana? kya haryana sarkaar ko hindu chaukiyon kii jaankaree he
 All these questions are formed
 ahuja ji ne jo kaha he use kam se kam rajasthan police ko gambhirtha se to lenaa hi chahie
 Even if not taken, we should at least overcome our shortcomings
 agar rajasthan police acha kaam kar rahi hoti to hindu chaowkee banane kii shaayad naubat hi nahin aati
 i am once again saying that Ahuja has said that 'I have built Hindu posts and Gau Raksha Chowk all over Mewat
 police chowkiyaan itnaa acha kaam nahin kar rahi hai
 ' aahuji ji ne apane is bayaan main kaha he ki grahamantri ne chah police chowkiyaan gau raksha ke liye banaai hai
 Which are not doing good work
 gau raksha ke liye bani police chaukiyon kii hamen koi jaankaree nahin he, ye hamaari kami he
 At least there should have been a comparative report between the police posts for Hindu posts and cow protection
 ab ek sawaal aapse bhi he or khud se bhi he
 We all have faith in the cow
 bahuton kii gaay main vaise hi aasthaa nahin he jaisi hamaari he
 It is perfectly normal to have faith in the cow, to worship it, to have reverence
 acchhee baat bhi he
 Faith is in many other things, so can we allow a crowd for that
 itani bahes ho gai, sabake bayaan aa gaye, reliyaan ho gayi, iske baad bhi bheed kaa hausala kyon nahin tham rahaa he
 If you have no sympathy with the death of Asha Khan killed in the name of cow protection, no compassion, then i have no problem with that either
 pahalu khan ke bacchon ke prati koi afsos nahin he to koi baat nahin
 But you will be worried about these people
 ye jo maar rahe hai
 They may be angry, they may not even run on their own
 marane vaala to ek hi he magar maarane vaale do chaar hon to kya ye chintaa kii baat nahin he
 If someone's hands are colored with blood in the crowd, if an accident happens, you will not be worried about these people either, are you not sympathetic to these cow guards too? ham video kii pushti nahin kar rahe hai lekin ek sawaal puch rahe hai
 Who is in the crowd hamaare hi log to hai na
 If their head is accused of blood, is it a good thing? maan lijie ki kisi or ghatana main aisi hi koi bheed se hatya ho jaati he, bhale police or raajnneeti unhen bachaa le lekin kya aap unhen apane bich sweekaar kar paaenge
 Are the people standing with the crowd being formed in the name of cow protection, worried about what will happen to their future after such an incident
 ye sab noujvaan ladke hai
 i am very sure that they will not sleep at night
 hatya kaa gunaah kabhi na kabhi zindagi main laut kar aata he
 Bothers isliye hamen hinsak bheed ke prati sahanubhuti to rakhni hi chahie
 There is someone among us in this crowd
 josh or junun main tokaa toki, bahesbaazi tak to thik he lekin usase aage jaakar kisi ko utarkar maarna, peetna or aisi sthiti paidaa kar dena ki maut hi ho jaae, mere khyaal se aap meri is baat se sahamat hai ki aisa nahin hona chahie
 We should all oppose this mob because by taking the law in our hands, one can become a murderer
 aise logon kaa raajnneetik dal istemaal hi karte hai
 They will be called brave, Jabanz will say, then when the topography of cow protection is weak politically, they will leave them
 in naujavaanon kaa jivan barbaad ho jayega
 Yes, if they want to serve the cow, then these young people should be supported
 unka hausala badhanaa chahie
 The service that the Prime Minister has said for them
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'main unase aagrah karata hum ek kaam kiijie sabase zyaada gaayen katl ke kaaran marati nahin hai, plastic khaane se marati hai
 Now these people who want to do social service, at least get the cow to stop eating plastic and stop throwing plastic people, there will be a huge cow service
 ' chand maheene puraani is baat ke sandarbh main hi maine apni baat kahi he
 Now you have to decide, your dear Prime Minister is right, my words are correct or that crowd is right
 ek baar aap yah tay kar lenge to mujhe puraa yakeen he ki aap pahalu khan kii maut par sharminda honge
 Whoever comes to condemn will not be able to stand with this crowd with the support of the manger
 alvar ke espi rahul prakaash ne kaha he ki gau taskar the yaa nahin the, isse marpet karne waalon kaa dosha kam nahin hota he
 Those who have been assaulted are charged to us under 302
 ye espi kaa bayaan he
 Can you support making the gang of youths 302 in the name of cow protection? kya aapako nahin lagata he ki koi inke jivan se khel rahaa he
 The comments pahalu khan ko jis gaadi se utaar kar daudaya gaya use arjuna naam kaa chaalak chalaa rahaa tha
 It is being said that the mob left him by asking his name
 ab agar gaay kii taskari aparaadh he to kya arjuna ke liye nahin he
 Does Arjun have the freedom to smuggle cows? At least Arjun should be questioned
 thik he ki use pahalu khan ne kiraaye par liya tha lekin jaipur se jab wo chota trek lekar chalaa tha tab to gaay dikhi hi hogi
 Aspect Khan was accompanied by his two sons Irshad and Arif
 tivi par kaise kaha jaae par gaay musalmaan bhi paalate hai
 Muslims also live by selling cow's milk
 is tarah se shaq ke aadhaar par kisi ko dauda kar maar diya jaae to kya pataa kisi din aap kisi gaay ke bagal main chal rahe hon, kuch khilaa rahe hon or bheed aakar maar de, kuch bhi kah de, kah degi ki gaay ko kahin or le ja rahe tha, kuch sandigdh khilaa rahaa tha
 Police have formed three special teams to arrest those who are accused of assault
 aropiyon ko pakadaney ke liye paanch-paanch hazaar kaa inaam rakhaa gaya he
 Police have arrested three people based on the videos and photographs
 lekin espi rahul prakaash ne jo baat kahi ki rajya se baahar le jane ke liye colector se permit leni hota he ye mahatvapurn he
 They may not be aware of this
 sirf is permit ke na hone se kya kisi ko gau taskar ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki kharidaar nagar nigam ke meley se kharid rahaa he, uski parchi lekar aa rahaa he
 NDTV reporter Harsha Kumari Singh tried to talk to several officials for this
 koi camere par nahin aayaa or na hi bataa sakaa ki shanivaar ko kitne logon ko transit permit diya gaya, agar aisa kanoon he jaisaa ki espi sahab kah rahe hai to uske liye meley main kya vyavastha kii gai
 Off the record everywhere got the answer
 lekin jaipur ke meyar ashok lahoti ne camere par jawaab diya
 All this is a matter of investigation
 espi ne kaha ki isse kisi kaa aparaadh kam nahin ho jaataa ki koi gau taskar tha yaa nahin
 As such, 11 people have been caught on charges of smuggling before Khyar Khan was killed
 hindu chowkiyaan kis kanoon se bani hai yaa hindu naam rakh lenaa hi kanoon he
 The public is crowded and there is a mob system
 ye sunakar lagegaa ki ahuja ji janata ko bhadkaa rahe hai
 No, they are not doing this
 unhone bas yahi kaha ki janata to bheed he or bheed tantra he
 Rather Ahuja ji should be applauded for the fact that he has also said that the public should not be beaten
 aisi baat ke liye kanoon he
 After this poignant statement, he has also said that 'we have given instructions to all the Hindu outposts that have been built here, that we do not have to fight any kind of cow smugglers, they should be captured and handed over to the police
 ' iske liye bhi bhuri bhuri prashansa kii jaani chahie
 This is a positive aspect of his statement
 lekin hindu chaukiyon kii baat sunakar main chaunk gaya
 Does the Alwar police know of Hindu posts that such posts have been formed in Mewat
 mevaat haryana main he
 Alwar is in Rajasthan
 alvar ke vidhayak ne haryana ke mevaat main hindu chowkiyaan kyon banavaai hai
 Does the Haryana government know about Hindu posts? ye sab sawaal to banate hai
 At least Rajasthan Police should take seriously what Ahuja ji has said
 na bhi le to kam se kam apni kamiyon ko dur karnaa chahie
 If the Rajasthan Police had been doing a good job, it might not have been possible to build a Hindu post
 ek baar phir bataa rahaa hum ki ahuja ne kaha he ki 'puure mevaat main maine hindu chowkiyaan or gau raksha chowk banaaya he
 Police posts are not working so well
 ' Ahuji ji has said in his statement that the Home Minister has made six police posts for cow protection
 jo acha kaam nahin kar rahi hai
 We do not have any information about police posts for cow protection, this is our shortage
 kam se kam hindu chaowkee or gau raksha ke liye bani police chaukiyon ke bich tulanaatmak report to honi hi chahie thi
 Now you have a question as well as your own
 ham sabaki gaay main aasthaa he
 Many cows do not have the same faith as we do
 gaay main aasthaa hona, uski puja karnaa, shraddha rakhana bilkul thik or saamaanya baat he
 Good thing too
 aasthaa to anya kai chizon main he to kya uske liye ham kisi bheed ko anumati de sakate hai
 There was so much debate, everyone got statements, rallies were held, why the crowd is not stopping even after this
 agar aapako gau raksha ke naam par maar diye gaye pahalu khan kii maut se koi sahanubhuti nahin he, koi karunaa nahin he to mujhe usase bhi koi pareshaani nahin he
 If there is no regret towards the children of Aspect Khan
 lekin in logon ke prati to aap chintit honge hi
 These who are killing
 gusse main ho saktaa he inkaa bhi khud par bas na chalaa ho
 If the person who dies is only one, but if the two who kill are four, is it not a matter of concern? bheed main kisi ke haath koon se rang jaaen, koi durghatana ho jaae to kya aap in logon ke prati bhi chintit nahin honge, kya aapaki sahanubhuti in gau rakshakon se bhi nahin he
 We are not verifying the video but asking a question
 bheed main koun he
 Our people are there
 agar inke sar koon kaa ilzaam aata he to kya ye acchhee baat he
 Suppose that in some other incident such a mob is killed, even if the police and politics save them, but will you be able to accept them among you
 kya gau raksha ke naam par ban rahi bheed ke saath khadey log is baat ko lekar chintit hai ki aisi ghatana ke baad unke bhavishya par kya asar padegaa
 These are all young boys
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki inhen raaton ko neend nahin aegi
 The crime of murder sometimes comes back to life
 pareshaan karata he
 Therefore, we must be sympathetic to the violent mob
 is bheed main hamaare hi bich kaa koi he
 Touki tokki in passion and passion, it is fine to argue, but going beyond that, killing and beating someone and creating a situation that leads to death, i think you agree with me that this should not happen
 ham sabko is bheed kaa isliye virodh karnaa chahie kyonki is tarah kanoon apane haath main lene se koi hatyara ban saktaa he
 Such people are used by political parties
 unhen bahadur kahenge, jabanz kahenge phir jab gau raksha kaa topic raajnneetik rup se kamazor padegaa to unhen chhod denge
 The lives of these young people will be ruined
 haa agar inhen gaay kii seva kerani he to bilkul in naujavaanon kaa saath dena chahie
 They should be encouraged
 wo seva jo pradhanmantri ne inke liye kahi he
 The Prime Minister had said, "I request them to do one thing
 Most of the cows do not die due to slaughter, they die by eating plastic
" ab ye jo samaaj seva karnaa chaahate hai kam se kam gaay ko plastic khaanaa band karvaa den or plastic logon kaa phenkna band karvaa den to bhi bahut badi go-seva hogi
 'I have spoken about this only a few months old
 ab tay aapako karnaa he, aapke priy pradhanmantri kii baat sahi he, meri baat sahi he yaa us bheed kii baat sahi he
 Once you decide this, then i am sure that you will be ashamed of the death of Pehom Khan

 If you have no sympathy with the death of Asha Khan killed in the name of cow protection, no compassion, then i have no problem with that either
 pahalu khan ke bacchon ke prati koi afsos nahin he to koi baat nahin
 But you will be worried about these people
 ye jo maar rahe hai
 They may be angry, they may not even run on their own
 marane vaala to ek hi he magar maarane vaale do chaar hon to kya ye chintaa kii baat nahin he
 If someone's hands are colored with blood in the crowd, if an accident happens, you will not be worried about these people either, are you not sympathetic to these cow guards too? ham video kii pushti nahin kar rahe hai lekin ek sawaal puch rahe hai
 Who is in the crowd hamaare hi log to hai na
 If their head is accused of blood, is it a good thing? maan lijie ki kisi or ghatana main aisi hi koi bheed se hatya ho jaati he, bhale police or raajnneeti unhen bachaa le lekin kya aap unhen apane bich sweekaar kar paaenge
 Are the people standing with the crowd being formed in the name of cow protection, worried about what will happen to their future after such an incident
 ye sab noujvaan ladke hai

 We should all oppose this mob because by taking the law in our hands, one can become a murderer
 aise logon kaa raajnneetik dal istemaal hi karte hai
 They will be called brave, Jabanz will say, then when the topography of cow protection is weak politically, they will leave them
 in naujavaanon kaa jivan barbaad ho jayega
 Yes, if they want to serve the cow, then these young people should be supported

 Now the family members of Lal Bahadur Shastri have also demanded from the government that the files related to Shastri's death should be made public
 shastri ji ke bete anil shastri ne kaha he ki jab ab subhash chandra bose se judi file saarvajanik kii ja sakati he to phir shastriji kii mrity se judi file kyon nahin? Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second Prime Minister of the country, died in mysterious circumstances on 11 January 1966 in Tashkent, Russia
 unki maut paak ke saath taashkand samjhaute ke baad ho gai
 The then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri went to Russia after India's victory over Pakistan in the 1965 war
 anil shastri kehete hai ki us vakt to main sirf 17 saal kaa tha lekin maa ne bataaya tha ki jab shastri ji kaa parthiv sharir dilli aayaa to us vakt unka cheharaa nila pad gaya tha or aankh ke paas safed dhabbe pad gaye the
 i also saw myself
 maa ne apane karibiyon se is baat ko kaha bhi ki shastri ji kii maut prakritik nahin lag rahi, baavjood us vakt naa to koi jaanch kamishan baithaaya gaya or naa hi rus main koi postmartm hua tha
 The comments itnaa hi nahin anil kehete hai ki hamaara andeh tab or bad gaya jab pataa chalaa ki shastri ji ko taashkand se 20 kilometre dur tehraaya gaya jahaan naa kamare main koi ghanti tha or naa hi koi telephone
 While the rest of the country's delegation was stationed in Tashkent
 itnaa hi nahi 2012 main ek artiai se khulaasa hua ki sarkaar isliye shastri ji se jude file ko isliye khulaasa nahin karnaa chaahati kyonki isse rashtriya suraksha ke saath-saath ek desh ke saath sambadh bighad jane kaa khatra tha
 Now that the government is celebrating the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the victory over Pakistan in 1965 for the first time, the family hopes that the Modi government may reveal the mystery behind Shastri's death
 desh ke duusare pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii maut rahasyamay halaat main rus ke taashkand main 11 janvari 1966 ko ho gai thi
 He died after a Tashkent agreement with Pakistan
 1965 ke yuddh main bharat kii paak par vijay ke baad taatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri rus gaye the
 Anil Shastri says that at that time i was only 17 years old, but my mother had told that when Shastriji's body came to Delhi, then his face had turned blue and there were white spots near his eyes
 maine bhi khud dekha tha
 Mother also told her close friends that Shastri's death did not look natural, despite that no commission of inquiry was set up nor any post-mortem took place in Russia
 tippaniyan Not only this, Anil says that our suspicion was increased when it came to know that Shastri ji was placed 20 km from Tashkent where there was neither a bell in the room nor a telephone
 jabaki desh ke baaki pratinidhimandal ko taashkand main tehraaya gaya tha
 Not only this, an RTI in 2012 revealed that the government did not want to disclose the file related to Shastri ji because it threatened to deteriorate national security as well as relations with a country
 ab jabaki sarkaar pehali baar 1965 main pakistan par mili jeet kaa swarna janyati samaaroh manaa rahi to parivaar waalon ko ummid he ki shaayad modi sarkaar shastri ji kii maut se jude rahasy par se pardaa uthaae

 aap chahen appal kaa MAC system chune yaa personal computer (PC), donon ke apane phaayde hai
 If you want to buy the system and are confused between Mac and PC, then these tips are for you: Operating System MAC operating system is completely different from PC
 yah Mac OS par chalata he jabaki pisi windos par
 Mac OS is more efficient and has less scope for error
 haalanki windos system main sarvice pack hota he jisamen system parformens sudhaarney se jude apadet bhi shaamil hote hai
 In general, everything depends on the use of the CPU
 pisi lines, unics or kuch anya oparating system par bhi chalata he
 Applications are more available in applicationswindows, it cannot be denied
 haalanki kuch aise software bhi hai jo donon oparating system par chalate hai
 But Mac software is more effective
 image or video processing ke field main aam taur par MAC ko praathamikta di jaati he
 It can be broadly said that if you want a more convenient computer then choose PC and if you want a capable and fast computer, then choose MAC
 securitiis str par MAC ke maalik ko zyada chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 However, there is a high risk of malware attack on pcs
 agar aap pisi par internet chalaa rahe hai to ek apadated anti virus jarur install karvaa lijie
 More than 90 percent of the market is occupied by pcs
 isliye windos par chal rahe pisi par havers kaa khatra bhi zyada he
 Price: The price of the Mac is apparently high
 yah appal kii marketing policy kii vajah se bhi he or MAC kii kshamta kii vajah se bhi
 PC is quite cheap at this stage
 essessories or dizinpisi customij kiya ja saktaa he isliye zyaadaatar log ise praathamikta dete hai
 You can add multiple components on a PC
 utani hi aasaani se unhen aninstall bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 But the accessories of MAC are made by Apple company itself
 isamen compatibility ek bada sirdard ban jaati he
 However, at the design level, the MAC system itself looks stylish

 Anna wrote, 'it is important to discuss why the young man was slapped
 aaj bhrashtachar din pratidin bad rahaa he
 Corruption has made life difficult for the common man
 bhrashtachar ke kaaran hi kaaphi mahangaai badi he
 "when reporters sought a response from Anna Hazare on the incident of Pawar's attack, the first comment he made was," Just a slap
 ’ hajaare ne apane blog main mana ki unhone ghatana par is tarah se pratikriya dete hue hinsa kii lekin samaaj kii behatari ke liye aisa kiya

 Social activist Anna Hazare admitted that after the attack on Union Minister Sharad Pawar in Delhi last month, he committed violence by making 'just a slap' remark but he did not consider the violence to be wrong
 anna ne likhaa, ‘sharad pavaar centre main krishi mantri hai or rajya main bijli mantri unki hi party ke hai
 Today, even after 22 years, the power pumps of the farmers are burnt due to low voltage, the crops are spoiled, the transformers are burnt, but even then the politicians do not get angry
 yah durbhagyapurna he
 'hazare said,' The farmers demonstrated near Pune
 un par goliyaan chalaayi gayi
 Three farmers died
 lekin rajanetaaon ko is par bhi gussa nahin aayaa
 He claimed that Sharad Pawar as Agriculture Minister imported rotten wheat which was not edible and was suppressed in large pits
 karodon rupee kii saarvajanik raashi barbaad ho gayi lekin koi rajaneta naaraaz nahin hue
 Hazare said, 'padma Singh Patil, a relative of Sharad Pawarji, was a minister in Sharad Pawar's cabinet
 jab vah mantri the to bhrashtachar main lipt the
 i demanded an investigation
 jab jaanch nahin hui to maine andolan shuru kiya
 He had to order an inquiry
 mantri doshi sabit hue or unhen cabinet se hataaya gaya
 He gave a betel nut to someone for killing me for revenge
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ek thappad ke kaaran kai log naaraaz ho gaye
 But when one who has dedicated his life to society and country is targeted then no one is offended
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah durbhagyapurna he
 i have one request
 agar aapako mere khilaaf gussa he or aap meraa putala jalaana chaahate hai, aap aisa karnaa jari rakhie kyonki aap ab tak aisa karte rahe hai
 Do what you want to do to humiliate me
 lekin rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen kyonki yah ham sabaki he
 Hazare alleged that Pawar's supporters abused him
 hajaare ne likhaa, ‘maine ricard ke liye isaki ek sidi rakhi he
 i will make it public when the appropriate time comes
 ’ padmasingh patil bhrasht the
 It has been proved unhone meri hatya ke liye supaari di
 This was also proved
 iske baad bhi sharad pavaar chunaavon main unke kaarykram main shaamil hue or logon se unke samarthan main matdaan karne kii apil kii
 
 iske baad bhi in rajanetaaon ko gussa nahin aayaa
 He said, "politicians became so angry with a slap that many buses were burnt, national property was damaged, many shops were targeted, many private vehicles were damaged, but this did not offend anyone
" ’ Drawing attention of News Channels to Clause b of Fundamental Std
 of NBSA refraining channels from causing panic, distress & undue fear

 ‘sahitya aaj tak’ ke ‘dalit lekhan kaa dam’ satr main dalit sahitya se jude teen bade lekhak sharankumar limbale, shyoraj singh baichaiyn or rajeev ranjan prasad shaamil hue
 The session was conducted by Sanjay Sinha
 charchaa ke dauraan varisht lekhak sharan kumaar limbale ne kaha ki jo samaaj main dikhataa he vahi sahitya main bhi hota he
 If untouchability remains in the society then its effect will definitely be seen in literature also
 unhone kaha ki pehle hamaari kavitaayen nahin chhaapi jaati thi, hamen kaha jaataa tha ki tum bhashaa likho, sahi tarah se likho
 After that, we had to change the name and write, then we were accepted
 ise padhein
 
 
 Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018: Prasoon Joshilimbale on the stage of Dastak Durbar said that mainstream literature does not have ideas, Baba Saheb Ambedkar's idea in our literature
 hamaari bhashaa logon ko gandagi lagati he, lekin us bhashaa se hamen pyaar he
 He said that when we talk about the Dalit character, his entire society comes with him
 dalit sahitya hameshaa kahata he ki main dayaa se ghrinaa karata hum
 Progressive writers wrote that is why the literature of Dalit society has reached here
 'baba sahib hi hai daliton ke sabase bade lekhak'patrkaar or lekhak shyoraj singh baichaiyn ne kaha ki samaaj main alag-alag jatiyaan hai isiilie dalit sahitya bhi he
 Nowadays talk of removing the word Dalit is being done, but more attention should be paid to changing the status of Dalit
 samaaj kii vividhta hi sahitya main dikhti he
 He said that the greatest writer of Dalit literature is Babasaheb Ambedkar
 sahitya samaaj kaa darpan bhi chinhit he, jo samaaj kaa vyakti likh rahaa he usee kaa mudda sahitya main bhi dikhataa he
 He said that even though Premchand wrote a story for Dalits, he is shown greedy in that story
 baichaiyn ne kaha ki bhartiya samaaj bahumanjaleey samaaj kii tarah he jahaan kisi ko ek manzil se duusari manzil par jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 The society will not understand until the sweeper will write the poem and tell the story
 chhattisgarh ke bastar se aae rajeev ranjan prasad ne is charchaa ke dauraan kaha ki sahitya ek bahut bada chaataa he, isamen dalit sahitya ek andolan kii tarah ubhara he
 There is no class differentiation from this, rather literature is expanded in every field
 unhone kaha ki dalit sahityakar apane lekhan kaa zyada sahi tareeke se istemaal kar rahaa he

 Ramesh said that to monitor the implementation of rural schemes in the country, a follow-up audit center will be set up similar to the CAG and Planning Commission

 Likewise, America's Fast Company ranks them among the 100 most creative people in the world in the field of business
 salmaan khan ne cinema ko safal bijness kaa model bana diya, chetan bhagat ne lekhan ko
 You will say that i had said in the beginning that i had done Chetan Bhagat's new novel Half Girlfriend, so much so that i would like to see Salman Khan's 100 crores and 200 crores business doing films like you and me
 What does the audience gain? It is achieved by reading Chetan Bhagat, it is just another new formula of success

 Coming to the story of 'half Girlfriend'
 ‘dilavaale dulhaniya le jaayenge’ film se sikvence aadhaarit patakathaon par film banane kaa jor badha tha
 The narrative of this novel is also in the sequence
 patna ke chanakya hotel main lekhak ko dumraanv kii khastahal riyasat kaa rajkumaar madhav jha miltaa he

 To improve the condition of her school, Madhav enrolls in a coaching course for learning English in Patna for her speech at Bill Gates
 (kamaal he bandaa steffens main padhakar bhi angreji nahin sikh paaya, jabaki vahaan se science onors karne vaale mere dost bhi angreji main gitpit karne lagate the), or chamatkaar hota he apane shaadi se dedh saal main chhutkaaraa paakar riya patna aa jaati he use angreji sikhaati he or jis din uske angreji bhaashan kaa fal yani bill gates kaa daan miltaa he usee din gaayab ho jaati he

 This is the story of a new blockbuster novel by a writer who wrote a blockbuster novel, which has a chance of becoming a confirmed blockbuster film

 lekin ek baat he bande ne research acha kiya he
 He goes to Maurya Lok to eat litti chokha, where he gets really good litti chokha
 lekin dumraanv kaa raja jha ji ko bana kar galati kar gaye bhagat babu
 But all goes on in fiction
 260 pej ke upanyaas ko padhe kaa yahi hasil he ki upanyaas vahi padhanaa chahie jise aap dilli se patna ke dedh ghante kii ek flite main pard saken
 The price should also be low and drama, melodrama combine, executive location, everything from sushi to litti chokha, and be it your Chanakya hotel in Patna, from village to countryside to New York life

 Hail to Chetan Bhagat Baba for giving all this in a novel

 The Union Government, intending to abolish the collegium system for appointment of judges in the judiciary, introduced the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha
 jiske tahat supreme court or hoicourt main jajon kii niyukti ke liye chah sadasyeey ikai ke gathan kaa praavdhaan he
 Apart from the Constitution Amendment Bill, Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also introduced another related bill 'national Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2014'
 samvidhan (121waan sanshodhan) vidheyak 2014 jahaan prastaavit ayog or isaki puri sanrachana ko samvidhan main nihit karata he
 At the same time, the second bill sets the procedure to be followed by the proposed entity for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court
 isamen jajon ke tabadale or ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhishon or anya nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke sambandh main bhi praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 According to the proposal, the Chief Justice of India will head the NJAC
 mukhya nyaayadhish ke alaava nyaaypalika kaa pratinidhitiv supreme court ke do varisht nyaayadhishon dwaara kiya jayega
 Two eminent personalities and the Law Minister will be the other members of the proposed unit
 nyaaypalika kii ashankaon ko dur karne ke liye ayog kii sanrachana ko sanvaidhanik darja diya gaya he taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki bhavishya main koi bhi sarkaar kisi saadhaaran vidheyak ke dwaara isaki sanrachana ko kamjor nahin kar sake
 While a Constitutional Amendment Bill requires a two-thirds majority, a simple Bill requires a simple majority
 nyaayadhishon kii niyukti kii vartmaan vyavastha ke sthaan par ucchtam nyaaypalika main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye rashtriya nyaayik ayog gathit karne ke sarkaar ke prastaav ke sandarbh main nyaayamurti lodha kii tippaniyan kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 The remarks came on a day when the government withdrew the bill to establish the National Judicial Commission from the Rajya Sabha and introduced two bills, including the constitutional amendment, for the new system for appointment of judges in the Lok Sabha
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha ki desh main nyaayadhishon ke nirnaayak mandal ke jariye niyukti hone vaale nyaayadhishon ke pehle batch kii vah dein he or nyaayamurti rohinton nariman, jo unke saath baithe hai, nirnaayak mandal ke jariye sheersh adaalat main padonnati praapt karne vaale sabase nae hai
 Justice Lodha said, 'if you say that the jury has failed, then their debt has also failed
 yadi aap aisa kehete hai, ham bhi vifal ho gayi hai or nyaaypalika bhi puri tarah se vifal ho gai he
 'he said,' In this case, now a little can be done
 ’ mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‘is samay ke sabhi nyaayadhish isi nirnaayak mandal vyavastha kii hi dein hai
 The jury has its own limitations in selecting individuals as institutions
 aakhirkaar nyaayadhish bhi isi samaaj se aate hai
 But the campaign is unfair because of allegations against one or two judges
 ’nyaayalay ne kaha, ‘nirnaayak mandal ne kabhi bhi nyaayamurti manjunath ke naam kii sifarish nahin kii
 The court said that this PIL is on inconsistent grounds
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘ishwar ke liye aise tathyon ko lekar yachika daayar mat kijiye jinka astitv hi nahin he
 Repeated efforts are being made about an issue which is factually incorrect
 ’nyaayadhishon ne kaha, ‘‘yadi janata kii najaron main nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kaa abhiyaan he to aap loktantr ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 Do not break public confidence in the judiciary
 ’ mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha ki media main galat tathy pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 He said that transfer of a judge is one thing, whereas promotion is a different matter
 hamane aisi koi sifarish nahin kii he
 As soon as the hearing of the case began, the court sought to know from the petitioner where the information was received about the recommendation of the judge's name by the jury
 nyaayalay ne jab yah kaha ki nyaayamurti manjunath ke naam kii sifarish nahin kii gai he to yachikakarta ke vakil ne media kii khabaron kaa hawala diya or kaha ki yadi media main aae tathy galat hai to phir is maamle main karrwai honi chahie
 But the court said that you want us to do judicial work on the basis of media reports
 yachika main anurodh kiya gaya tha ki bhavishya main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke bare main nirnaayak mandal kii sari siforishein sheersh adaalat kii website par daali jaani chahie

 Woods, however, was left at 10:50 minutes on a private bond
 farvari main peeth kii takalif ke kaaran dubai desert clasik se hatane ke baad se 41 saal ke woods pratispardhi golf nahin khele hai
 Woods has been a longtime monarch of golf, but his game life has gone downhill since 2009 after his divorce revealed his personal life
 in dinon woods peeth kii surgery ke baad se apane puraane form ko hasil karne ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 Tiger Woods, 41, was recovering from a recent back surgery
 unhone 24 may ko apni sehat ke bare main blog main likhaa tha
 In which he said that surgery has given him immense relief from pain and he never felt so good throughout the year
 tiger woods ne 2013 ke baad se koi toornament nahin jeeta he
 The Supreme Court has recently passed an important decision regarding jobs in government posts
 is faisle ke tahat jahaan sarkaar cader main ek hi pad ko bhar rahi hogi, vahaan anusuchit jati, janajati, anya pichhadaa varg ke liye koi aarakshan nahin hoga
 The court has also clarified that if any person of the reserved category is already in a government job and is eligible for the post to be filled through the department promotion, he will not suffer any loss while appointing a post
 nyaayadhish deepak mishra or nyaayadhish pisi pant kii peeth ne purv ke do nirnyon kaa hawala bhi diya
 The Bench of both the judges said that it is clear that by giving reservation on one post, the general quota contestants will be already out and the issue of reservation will be raised if more posts are admitted
 justise mishra or pant kii bech ne purv main die gaye do nirnyon ke aadhaar par kaha ki yadi clerk cader main ek pad khaali he to use pramotion ke jariye bharaa janaa chahie jisase aarakshan kaa mudda uthe hi nahin

 com / nmosrmmqhi Comments hindustan ke sabase bade dushmano main ek, saikadon begunaahon ke katl kaa gunahagaar, united neshans kii taraf se 10 million yues dollar ke inami aatankwaadi hafiz said ke sitare achaanak gardish main aa gaye
 He was suddenly under house arrest in Pakistan, but which Pakistan has so far ignored countless evidence against Hafiz Saeed, why did he now suddenly arrest Hafiz Saeed? This is also the question of lakhs
 hafiz said kii zindagi main ab tak sabakuch thik chal rahaa tha
 He would enter the bill silently by shedding the blood of innocents
 kabhi jehad ke naam par kashmir ke algaavvaadiyon ko bhadakaane kii koshish karata
 Sometimes, he would elevate himself by calling India and America his enemies
 kabhi apane hi mulk ke hukmaranon kii khul kar mazzamat bhi karata
 But now the date has changed
 nizaam badal chukaa he
 With this, the fate of Hafiz has changed
 shaayad tabhi, jo haafiz said kal tak apane sir par das million yues dollar kaa inaam lekar bhi pakistan main chutta gum rahaa tha
 He had to be under house arrest overnight
 pehle sarkaar ne most argent ke tag line ke saath us par shikanja kasne kaa farmaan jari kiya or phir agle hi din use nazarband karne pakistan kii police lahore ke uske thikaane par ja pahunchi
 But on the go, Hafiz Saeed once again spewed poison
 duniya main kam hi aise log honge, jinhen vaaki haafiz said ke khilaaf hui ye karrwai, asardaar karrwai lagati hogi
 Rather, according to experts, this exercise to detain him is nothing but Pakistani drama
 varanaa haafiz said ke khilaaf akele hindustan ne hi pakistan ko itane subut saunpe he ki agar ek baar bhi pakistan ne unhen sanjidagi se liya hota, to haafiz kii baaki kii umr salaakhon ke peeche hi nikal jaati
 After all, what kind of compulsion came suddenly with Pakistan that against which he had so far ignored the countless proofs, suddenly he had to put his hands on the same Hafiz Saeed
 iskaa jawaab he hindustan ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kii dehshatgardi ke khilaaf chhedi gai muhim or saat samandar paar america main badla nizaam
 From the very first day, Donald Trump, the new president of the US, has been saying to be strict against terrorism
 naa sirf baat kehete rahe hai satta main aate hi unhone saat mulkon ke nagarikon kii apane yahaan entry par roak laga di he
 On the other hand, on the issue of terrorism, Modi and Trump are seen standing alongside each other
 aise main pakistan par dabaav kaa bananaa laazmi he
 According to experts, this is the reason, because of being nervous, now Pakistan has started talking about arresting him, which used to be the star of his eyes till yesterday
 aise main ye karrwai kaa asli matlab aanevaala kal hi batayega
 There has been an uproar as soon as the first list of BJP candidates was released in Bihar
 25 logon kii list main patna sahib ke saansad shatrughna sinha kaa naam nahin hone se unki naaraazgi saamne aa sakati he
 According to sources close to Bihari Babu, Shatrughan Sinha has made it clear that Patna Sahib is his first and last choice and there is no scope for any discussion on the issue
 gauratlab he ki list jari karte vakt party mahasachiv anant kumaar ne kaha ki shatrughna sinha se baatcheet karke patna sahib kii seat tay kii jaaegi, haalanki bihari babu intjaar karne ko to taiyaar hai par kisi surat main patna sahib kii seat nahin chodenge, ye saaf ho gaya he
 On the other hand, Giriraj Singh, the bjp's firebrand leader and considered to be Modi's special person, has indicated that he will not contest from there after the candidature of Nawada seat is announced
 giriraaj singh ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik wo navada se tikat die jane khaase naaraaz hai
 Giriraj Singh had sought the seat of Begusarai for himself, but the party has given ticket to Nawada MP Bhola Singh from Begusarai
 udhar narendra modi ke duusare kareebi or rashtriya sachiv rameshwar chaurasia bhi naaraaz hai
 Chaurasia was claiming the Karakat seat, but according to sources, this seat is set to be given to Upendra Kushwaha's party in the coalition, in which Chaurasia has also conveyed his displeasure to the high command
 jis tarah se maujuuda 12 saansadon main se 11 saansdo kii ummidavaari ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he par bihari babu kii seat par suspence bana hua he isse saaf he ki bihar bijepi main kalah khulkar saamne aa sakati he
 Shatrughan Sinha, known for his rebellious style, has not spoken openly, but like Uttar Pradesh, now in Bihar, the BJP may have to face discord within the party

 In Madhya Pradesh, where Jyotiraditya Scindia, who once saw himself as a contender for the post of CM, now wants to become the state Congress president, to which CM Kamal Nath said that this is not an issue
 aapako bataa den ki kamalnath is samay mukhyamantri or pradesh congress adhyaksh donon kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai
 Talking to NDTV, he said that he feels a lot of weight due to both these responsibilities and that he is with the idea that Jyotiraditya Scindia should take charge of the party
 vahi jab unase maharashtra, punjab, haryana main congress ikaayiyon main ho rahe jhagade par sawaal poocha gaya to unka kahana tha ki yah sabhi partiyon main hota he
 When asked about the relationship between Jyotiraditya Scindia and him and also asked if Scindia would prove to be a good relationship, Kamal Nath replied, 'he (scindia) has experience, he has a team, so why? No? In fact, i say that no one but it should be hurried '
 gauratlab he ki jyotiraditya sindhiya jo ki vidhansabha chunaav ke samay se hi kisi vajandaar pad ko paane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 After failing to get the post of Chief Minister or Deputy Chief Minister, he is now expressing his desire to become the least State Party President

 Tea is good and reliable, so you take special care to buy tea from the uniform vendor
 kai baar railway stesan par yatriyon ko aagaah karne ke liye likhaa bhi jaataa he ki sirf railway ke othorided vendor se hi chaay yaa khaane pine kii chijen khariden kyonki baahar ke anjaan logon ke khaane pine kii chijen khareednaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he

 And these are the people wearing the uniforms - in front of the eyes of the passengers
 yakeen na ho to khud dekh lijie
 In this video, this man is hovering near the train toilet with a cup of tea in a blue shirt pocket
 train kisi stesan par rukii hui he or wo kuch ghabaraaya hua sa dikh rahaa he
 It is clear from his antics that he is waiting for something
 wo train ke daravaaje par jaakar dekhtaa he or idhar- udhar dekh rahaa he ki kahin koi aa to nahin rahaa he
 For a full fifty seconds, he looks like waiting outside the toilet
 phir toilet kaa darwaja khulata he or tab ye baat saaf ho jaati he ki wo train ke toilet ke paas kya kar rahaa he 
 The toilet door opens and his other companion looks inside
 wo bheetar se steel kaa chaay bechney vaala ek container is aadmi ko pakadaata he
 This container is maintained by Votrain's gate and quickly takes another such container from the man who is inside the toilet
 teesraa aisa hi container lekar toilet ke bheetar vaala aadmi baahar nikal rahaa tha ki tabhi use saamne se ek yatri aata hua dikhataa he wo baahar nikalne ke bajaay duusari taraf chalaa jaataa he
 But as soon as it comes again, those people realize that their actions are being captured in mobile
 unki video banane vaala vyakti unase telegu main poochta he ki wo chaay kaa pani toilet se kyon le rahe hai
 Both do not answer anything
 or kuch ghabara kar baahar jane ke bajaay train main duusare dibbe kii taraf chale jate hai
 Then the third partner of these people on the platform sees that their theft has been caught
 wo aata he or train ke get par rakhaa hua container lekar chalaa jaataa he
 As soon as this video came on social media, it became increasingly viral
 jisane ise dekha,gusse se uskaa khun khaulane laga
 People wondered how the railway could allow this to happen to its passengers
 maamla or bhi zyada isliye gambhir ho jaataa he kyonki jo log besharmi ke saath logon ko toilet ke pani se chaay pilaane main lage the wo vardi main dikh rahe the
 The vendor's company logo can be seen on the blue shirt

 But the railways admitted that the third person standing on the platform is PN Jayachandra, the railway's caterer

 We also talked to Shivprasad but instead of answering, he hung up the phone saying that the color of the uniform of his people is something else
 lekin railway kaa kahana he ki poochtacha ke dauraan is jayachandra ne bataaya ki wo log toilet ke bheetar pani nahin bhar rahe the balki doodh ek bartan se duusare bartan main daal rahe the
 But the railways took p to carry the food items in the toilet
