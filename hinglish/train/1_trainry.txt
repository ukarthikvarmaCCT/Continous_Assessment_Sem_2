 One such controversy dates back to 2008, when she claimed that she and her daughter had escaped from gunshot bullets in 1996 as the First Lady (president's wife) when she landed at Bosnia's airport

 In this film a city returns to its hometown
 1911 ke saal main kolkata dilli aa gaya tha, 2015 ke saal main bhaskar ghosh dilli ke chittaranjan park se kolkata lautnaa chaahate hai
 He wants to return to Kolkata after seeing a lot of new things
 ek kabz he jo in do shaharon ke darmyaan fansaa hua he
 i am the one who is involved in the story of 'piku'
 main kolkata kaa nahin hum par kolkata meraa shahar bhi he
 When i return once a year, like Bhaskar Banerjee, i wander alone in its buildings, paths and streets
 jab dopaher kaa khaanaa khaakar har koi so rahaa hota he to main nikal jaataa hum
 Don't know where ek puraane shahar ke vajood main lautnaa us kami ko ek or shahar main puri kar detaa he
 Patna and Kolkata are the past of my life
 patna ateet he par kolkata ateet sa
 Since the city is still left as it was in the past or past, perhaps coming to Kolkata is like returning to Nostalgia
 'piku' kii kahani kaa har doosraa seen meri zindagi se hokar guzarataa he
 i have gone through every other frame of this film
 belur math ke paas kii jetti, yamuna express-ve se utarate hi sadak ke saath-saath chalane vaali rail kii line, banaras or haa chittaranjan park bhi
 When he came to Delhi in the year 1990, he started going to Chittaranjan Park's Market One
 tab karidaari ke paise nahin hote the, par taji machhliyon ko dekhakar dil bhar jaataa tha
 Stomach too
 'piku' ke paas jo homeopathy kii dawaaiyon kaa baksaa he, vah mere sirahaane bhi he
 There is also a 'piku' in my house, who is the master of these medicines
 nile cap vaali shishi es
 B
 el
 Has bryaniya, arnika, arsenic, maxol
 In the drawer, these medicines have to be searched daily
 shujit sarkaar ne aadhi film yamuna express-ve par hi kaat lee he
 They complete the bulk of their story while shooting back and forth
 pehle laga tha dhanbad, asanasol bhi rukenge, lekin lagata he ki film ke kalakaaron ko dilli se banaras or kolkata kii flite se hi le gaye
 But i am definitely thinking that i did not come home to write the story of the film! film kii kahani likhane se batch rahaa hum
 We all have to grow old one day
 ham sabko apane us buudhe shahar kii yaad aegi
 The daughters support very far
 vaise filmon se ab bete dur hote ja rahe hai
 The daughter is the new heir
 mere paas do-do 'piku' hai
 Obviously, this change must have taken place in the society as well
 ek pita or beti ke rishte ke lihaaz se bhi film ko padhaa ja saktaa he
 It can also be seen in this way that all is not finished yet
 ladate-jhagadate mausi, chachee or chachaa ek mez par khaanaa kha sakate hai
 If you have anything left, then you should also build a house
 champakunj kii tarah
 Deepika is not the heroine of this film
 vah kirdaar main is kadar dhal gai hai ki lagata hi nahin ki vah deepika hai
 Amitabh Bachchan Sahab has not engaged in any film since his time
 vah bhaskar banerjee hi lagate hai
 a character who is not covered as a bed sheet on Bachchan Sahab's personality, but rather has merged into Bachchan Sahab Bhaskar Banerjee
 hamaare ghar ke buzurg bhi dilli nahin tik pate hai
 The joy that appears on his face while leaving Delhi is probably still left inside me
 kabhi kisi mode par chhalak kar baahar aa jane ke liye
 Irfan plays a non-bengali character in the same way as i play 'robish' in Kolkata
 smart city ke daur main jab gaanv ke gaanv ujaad die jaaenge tab bhi koi bhaskar banerjee bachaa rahegaa
 To touch the past with the help of trees and wells that have survived somewhere between those newly built cities
 bahut logon ne is niyati ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Many people have not been able to accept
 migration ek sachai he
 Millions of people are being threatened
 jaden kahin nahin bachi hai, bas lagata he ki bachi hui hai
 Talking of roots in the film, Irrfan seems to have gone far away from his roots, while his family is also hit by migration
 jab irafaan kehete hai ki jaden nahin bachengi to kya bachegaa to ek baar ke liye main sihar gaya
 What can be done, perhaps that is why a film like 'piku' will come as a memory for us
 phir se cycle pakadaa degi
 Take a bicycle and start wandering
 kahin cycle rokkar kisi or ke guzar rahe bachapan main jhankkar apana bachapan ji lo
 The comments ham sab ek tanaavpurn daur main ji rahe hai
 Older people have been destroyed even within Bombay and Delhi
 vah puraani dilli se laksminagar jaakar puraani dilli ko miss karte hai, to mayur vihaar aakar aar
 K
 puram ko
 Nostalgia is a middle class hobby
 hamen pataa bhi nahin ki hamaari hi tarah migration karne vaale lakhon mazaduron kii nostalgia kya hai
 Whether he has any Deepika or Irrfan to bring those memories on screen
 jaise is film main raghuveer yadav kaa cheharaa kai baar missfit lagane lagata he
 Anyone who has 'piku' will live this journey in their life
 bina 'piku' ke nahin lautaa ja sakegaa
 Who leaves her career and walks away with her father
 acchhee film vah hoti he jo aapako kuch der ke liye acha bana de
 Laugh a little, make me cry a little
 'piku' waisi hi film he
 Describes life as life
 ham sab apane apane bheetar us shahar or gaanv ko bachaae rakhen
 'piku' is our story
 shujit sarkaar kii nahin

 'piku' is our story
 shujit sarkaar kii nahin
 Shoojit da apni bhalo cinema baniye chhen besh bhaalo
 Every second scene of 'piku' story goes through my life
 is film ke har duusare frem se khud guzar chukaa hum
 The jetty near Belur Math, the line of rail running along the road as soon as the Yamuna Expressway comes off, Banaras and yes Chittaranjan Park
 1990 ke saal dilli aayaa tha to chittaranjan park ke market van main janaa shuru ho gaya
 Then there was no money to buy, but it was heartening to see fresh fish
 pet bhi
 The box of homeopathic medicines near 'piku' is also at my bedside
 mere ghar main bhi koi 'piku' he, jo in dawaaon kii master he
 Blue cap vial s
 bi
 L
 kii he
 Bryonia, Arnica, Arsenic, Mxaul
 daraaj main rose in dawaaon ko tatolna pad jaataa he
 Shoojit Sarkar has cut half the film on Yamuna Expressway
 aage peeche shoot karte hue ve apni kahani kaa bada hissaa puraa kar lete hai
 It was earlier thought that Dhanbad, Asansol will also stop, but it seems that the actors of the film were taken from Delhi to Banaras and Kolkata flights
 par yah zarur soch rahaa hum ki film kii kahani likhane vaali mere ghar to nahin ai thi! i am avoiding writing the story of the film
 ham sabko ek din boodha hona he
 We will all remember that old city of ours
 betiyaan bahut dur tak saath detii hai
 By the way, sons are becoming distant from films
 beti hi nai vaaris he
 i have a couple of 'piku'
 zaahir he yah badlaav samaaj main bhi ho gaya hoga
 The film can also be read in terms of the relationship between a father and a daughter
 is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki ab bhi sab samaapt nahin hua he
 Fighting aunts, aunts and uncles can have dinner at a table while fighting
 kahin kuch bachaa ho to jodakar aap bhi ek ghar bana lijie
 Like Champakunj
 deepika is film kii nayika nahin he
 She is so cast in the character that it does not seem that she is Deepika
 amitabh bachchan sahab jamaane baad kisi film main bachchan nahin lage hai
 He appears to be Bhaskar Banerjee
 ek aisa kirdaar jo bachchan sahab kii hasti par chadar kii tarah odhaaya nahin gaya he, balki bachchan sahab bhaskar banerjee main samaa gaye hai
 Even the elders of our house do not live in Delhi
 dilli chhodte vakt unke chehre par jo khushi nazar aati he shaayad vah mere bheetar bhi bachi hui he
 Never spill at some point to come out
 ek gair bengali kirdaar ko irafaan ne thik vaise hi nibhaayaa he, jaise main ‘robish’ banakar kolkata main nibhaataa hum
 In the era of smart city, when Bhaskar will be desolate, any Bhaskar Banerjee will remain
 un nae bane shaharon ke bich kahin kisi vajah se batch gaye pedo or kuon ke sahare ateet ko chhu lene ke liye
 Many people have accepted this destiny
 bahut log sweekaar nahin kar paae hai
 Migration is a fact
 lakhon log hizarat kar rahe hai
 The roots are nowhere left, it seems that there are left
 film main jadon kii baat karte hue irafaan khud jadon se bahut dur ja chuke lagate hai, jabaki unka parivaar bhi migration kaa maaraa hua hota he
 When Irfan says that the roots will not survive, what will be left, then i shuddered for once
 kya kiya ja saktaa he, shaayad isiilie 'piku' jaisi film ham jaison ke liye ek yaad banakar aayaa karegi
 Will cycle again
 lo chalaao cycle or bhatakane lago
 Live your childhood by stopping somewhere in your childhood while passing a bicycle
 tippaniyan We are all living in a stressful phase
 bombai or dilli ke bheetar bhi puraane log ujaad chuke hai
 If he goes to Laxminagar from Old Delhi and misses Old Delhi, then come to Mayur Vihar
 ke
 To Puram
 nostalgia middle class shauk he
 We do not even know what the nostalgia of millions of laborers like ours are
 unke paas un yaadon ko parde par ubhaarne ke liye koi deepika yaa irfan he bhi yaa nahin
 Like Raghuveer Yadav's face seems to be misfit at times in this film
 jis kisi ke paas 'piku' he, vah apane jivan main is yatra ko ji legaa
 Cannot be returned without 'piku'
 jo apana karier chhod pita ke saath chal detii he
 a good film is one that makes you good for a while
 thodaa hansaa de thodaa rulaa de
 'piku' is the same film
 zindagi ko zindagi kii tarah bayaan karti he
 Let us all keep that city and village within ourselves
 'piku' hamaari hi kahani he
 Not Shoojit's government
 shujit da aapni bhaalo cinema baniye chhen
 Take care
 shujit sarkaar ne aadhi film yamuna express-ve par hi kaat lee he
 They complete the bulk of their story while shooting back and forth
 pehle laga tha dhanbad, asanasol bhi rukenge, lekin lagata he ki film ke kalakaaron ko dilli se banaras or kolkata kii flite se hi le gaye
 But i am definitely thinking that i did not come home to write the story of the film! film kii kahani likhane se batch rahaa hum
 We all have to grow old one day
 ham sabko apane us buudhe shahar kii yaad aegi
 The daughters support very far
 vaise filmon se ab bete dur hote ja rahe hai
 The daughter is the new heir
 mere paas do-do 'piku' hai
 Obviously, this change must have taken place in the society as well
 ek pita or beti ke rishte ke lihaaz se bhi film ko padhaa ja saktaa he
 It can also be seen in this way that all is not finished yet
 ladate-jhagadate mausi, chachee or chachaa ek mez par khaanaa kha sakate hai
 If you have anything left, then you should also build a house
 champakunj kii tarah
 Deepika is not the heroine of this film
 vah kirdaar main is kadar dhal gai hai ki lagata hi nahin ki vah deepika hai
 Amitabh Bachchan Sahab has not engaged in any film since his time
 vah bhaskar banerjee hi lagate hai
 a character who is not covered as a bed sheet on Bachchan Sahab's personality, but rather has merged into Bachchan Sahab Bhaskar Banerjee
 hamaare ghar ke buzurg bhi dilli nahin tik pate hai
 The joy that appears on his face while leaving Delhi is probably still left inside me
 kabhi kisi mode par chhalak kar baahar aa jane ke liye
 Irfan plays a non-bengali character in the same way as i play 'robish' in Kolkata
 smart city ke daur main jab gaanv ke gaanv ujaad die jaaenge tab bhi koi bhaskar banerjee bachaa rahegaa
 To touch the past with the help of trees and wells that have survived somewhere between those newly built cities
 bahut logon ne is niyati ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Many people have not been able to accept
 migration ek sachai he
 Millions of people are being threatened
 jaden kahin nahin bachi hai, bas lagata he ki bachi hui hai
 Talking of roots in the film, Irrfan seems to have gone far away from his roots, while his family is also hit by migration
 jab irafaan kehete hai ki jaden nahin bachengi to kya bachegaa to ek baar ke liye main sihar gaya
 What can be done, perhaps that is why a film like 'piku' will come as a memory for us
 phir se cycle pakadaa degi
 Take a bicycle and start wandering
 kahin cycle rokkar kisi or ke guzar rahe bachapan main jhankkar apana bachapan ji lo
 The comments ham sab ek tanaavpurn daur main ji rahe hai
 Older people have been destroyed even within Bombay and Delhi
 vah puraani dilli se laksminagar jaakar puraani dilli ko miss karte hai, to mayur vihaar aakar aar
 K
 puram ko
 Nostalgia is a middle class hobby
 hamen pataa bhi nahin ki hamaari hi tarah migration karne vaale lakhon mazaduron kii nostalgia kya hai
 Whether he has any Deepika or Irrfan to bring those memories on screen
 jaise is film main raghuveer yadav kaa cheharaa kai baar missfit lagane lagata he
 Anyone who has 'piku' will live this journey in their life
 bina 'piku' ke nahin lautaa ja sakegaa
 Who leaves her career and walks away with her father
 acchhee film vah hoti he jo aapako kuch der ke liye acha bana de
 Laugh a little, make me cry a little
 'piku' waisi hi film he
 Describes life as life
 ham sab apane apane bheetar us shahar or gaanv ko bachaae rakhen
 'piku' is our story
 shujit sarkaar kii nahin
 Shoojit da apni bhalo cinema baniye chhen besh bhaalo
 i am avoiding writing the story of the film
 ham sabko ek din boodha hona he
 We will all remember that old city of ours
 betiyaan bahut dur tak saath detii hai
 By the way, sons are becoming distant from films
 beti hi nai vaaris he
 i have a couple of 'piku'
 zaahir he yah badlaav samaaj main bhi ho gaya hoga
 The film can also be read in terms of the relationship between a father and a daughter
 is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki ab bhi sab samaapt nahin hua he
 Fighting aunts, aunts and uncles can have dinner at a table while fighting
 kahin kuch bachaa ho to jodakar aap bhi ek ghar bana lijie
 Like Champakunj
 deepika is film kii nayika nahin he
 She is so cast in the character that it does not seem that she is Deepika
 amitabh bachchan sahab jamaane baad kisi film main bachchan nahin lage hai
 He appears to be Bhaskar Banerjee
 ek aisa kirdaar jo bachchan sahab kii hasti par chadar kii tarah odhaaya nahin gaya he, balki bachchan sahab bhaskar banerjee main samaa gaye hai
 Even the elders of our house do not live in Delhi
 dilli chhodte vakt unke chehre par jo khushi nazar aati he shaayad vah mere bheetar bhi bachi hui he
 Never spill at some point to come out
 ek gair bengali kirdaar ko irafaan ne thik vaise hi nibhaayaa he, jaise main ‘robish’ banakar kolkata main nibhaataa hum
 In the era of smart city, when Bhaskar will be desolate, any Bhaskar Banerjee will remain
 un nae bane shaharon ke bich kahin kisi vajah se batch gaye pedo or kuon ke sahare ateet ko chhu lene ke liye
 Many people have accepted this destiny
 bahut log sweekaar nahin kar paae hai
 Migration is a fact
 lakhon log hizarat kar rahe hai
 The roots are nowhere left, it seems that there are left
 film main jadon kii baat karte hue irafaan khud jadon se bahut dur ja chuke lagate hai, jabaki unka parivaar bhi migration kaa maaraa hua hota he
 When Irfan says that the roots will not survive, what will be left, then i shuddered for once
 kya kiya ja saktaa he, shaayad isiilie 'piku' jaisi film ham jaison ke liye ek yaad banakar aayaa karegi
 Will cycle again
 lo chalaao cycle or bhatakane lago
 Live your childhood by stopping somewhere in your childhood while passing a bicycle
 tippaniyan We are all living in a stressful phase
 bombai or dilli ke bheetar bhi puraane log ujaad chuke hai
 If he goes to Laxminagar from Old Delhi and misses Old Delhi, then come to Mayur Vihar
 ke
 To Puram
 nostalgia middle class shauk he
 We do not even know what the nostalgia of millions of laborers like ours are
 unke paas un yaadon ko parde par ubhaarne ke liye koi deepika yaa irfan he bhi yaa nahin
 Like Raghuveer Yadav's face seems to be misfit at times in this film
 jis kisi ke paas 'piku' he, vah apane jivan main is yatra ko ji legaa
 Cannot be returned without 'piku'
 jo apana karier chhod pita ke saath chal detii he
 a good film is one that makes you good for a while
 thodaa hansaa de thodaa rulaa de
 'piku' is the same film
 zindagi ko zindagi kii tarah bayaan karti he
 Let us all keep that city and village within ourselves
 'piku' hamaari hi kahani he
 Not Shoojit's government
 shujit da aapni bhaalo cinema baniye chhen
 Take care

 Pakistan's Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz said that there is no hope of improving relations between India and Pakistan during the tenure of Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi
 ajij ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki kshetra main bharat ke aadhipatywaadee rukh kaa pakistan virodh karata rahaa he or barabari ke aadhaar par dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko badhaava dene kii maang karata rahaa he
 Aziz said that the Parliament of Pakistan has unanimously passed a resolution condemning 'vandalism' in Kashmir, violation of ceasefire along the Line of Control by India, denying India as an integral part of Kashmir, cancellation of Indus Water Agreement Issues such as condemning India's threat to commit and India's intervention in Balochistan
 ajij ne kaha ki in sabhi koshishon kaa mukhya agenda duniya ko yah bataanaa he ki puraa pakistan bhartiya akraman ke khilaaf ekajute he
 He said that after talks in various forums all over the world, the same thing has emerged that talks should start between the two countries

 According to Radio Pakistan, Aziz said that India could not succeed in diverting the attention of the entire world from the Kashmir issue through the 'own incident in Uri'
 tippaniyan Tensions between the two countries have peaked following the terrorist attack on the Indian Army's Brigade Headquarters at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir and the subsequent surgical strike on terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by India

 unhone kaha ki puri duniya main vibhinn manchon par baatcheet ke baad yahi baat ubharkar ai he ki donon deshon ke bich baatcheet shuru honi chahie
 On the announcement by the Union Home Minister of India Rajnath Singh to completely seal India's border with Pakistan by the year 2018, Aziz said that if the movement of people and the business relationship is maintained, then pakistan-india border should be sealed
 There is no harm
 radio pakistan ke mutabik, ajij ne kaha ki bharat 'uri main khud kii karai ghatana' ke madhyam se puri duniya kaa dhyaan kashmir mudde se bhatakaane main safal nahin ho saktaa

 tiger dekhakar kahani kaa bahut had tak andaja lag jaataa he
 The story of the film focuses on a young girl from Pakistan and her homecoming

 Like all his films, Salman has also come up with a new dialogue in the teaser-trailer - 'will die, but will not lie
 'simple se dikhne vaale salmaan film ke trailor main jabardast asar chhodte hai
 The film stars Kareena Kapoor with Mancelman

 dekhen film 'bajrangi bhaijan' katiger: Nokia 1 Plus This smartphone is a pure entry level
 ise company ne barsilona main chal rahe mobile world congress ke dauraan shokes ke liye rakhaa he
 The company's aim may be to attract first-time smartphone users with it
 is smartphone ko hamane kuch samay tak ke liye yuj kiya he or is aadhaar par bataate hai ki isamen kya khaas he or isaki kamiyaan kya hai
 On seeing this smartphone, the first thing that will come to mind is the bright
 phone ke colors brit hai or iskaa red color verient bhi he
 The phone has a headphone jack and the company has set up vertical speakers at the bottom of it
 pehle smartphone kii bydaree khud se nikaali ja sakati thi
 End of the era of smartphones with removable batteries
 lekin nahin, is smartphone main removable bydaree di gai he
 You can remove it and replace it like the previous Nokia phones
 is phone kii disple se zyada ummid nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki ye entry level divaais he
 But this is fine according to this price range
 ab baat karte hai iske camere kii
 It has an 8 megapixel single camera
 selfi ke liye bhi ek hi camera he jo 5 megapixl kaa he
 We used its camera
 kah sakate hai ki decent photose clic hoti hai
 But even then it could be improved further, since its price has not been announced in India, so it cannot be said right now
 hamane jahaan iskaa camera test kiya vahaan acchhee raushnee he
 So the photos have come Decent
 selfi ke liye isamen 5 megapixl kaa sensor he or selfi vijie quality se acchhee aati he
 Now talking about the battery, here we can not test its backup
 lekn company kaa daawa he ki kii yah damdaar byaap degi
 It has a 2500 mah battery
 company kaa daawa he ki ise phul charge karke lagaataar 83 ghante tak baat kar sakate hai
 Talking about performance, it is the average
 ek baat or bataa den ki agar aap is smartphone main lite eps yuj karenge to ye kaaphi smood honge
 But this phone is not made for running heavy apps or gaming
 ek saath pachaas ap khol kar kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 Overall, the price of this smartphone in India will decide how this smartphone is
 kyonki yuj karne, hold karne main or parformens camera- ye sari chijen to thik hai
 But we have given a quick review on the basis that it will be an entry level smartphone
 keemat agar thodi bhi zyada hui to nokia ke is phone ke liye market main mushkil ho sakati he
 So the company has to bring it to India with aggressive prices

 In such a situation, if it is delayed then BJP will get the benefit

 ho saktaa he ki jab ranbir kapur or sani leyoni kaa gaanaa filmaaya jaae, tab ranbir ke saath unki khaas dost katrina kaiff maujuud rahen
 Sources reveal that this song of Ranbir and Sunny is very seductive, so perhaps Katrina herself may be present on the set at the time of shooting
 darasal, film 'i dil he mushkil' ke liye ranbir or sani leyoni ek saath ek item sang karne ja rahe hai
 Sunny will be seen doing something similar in this song, just like Helen did with Amitabh Bachchan in the film 'don'
 gane ke saath-saath sani kii film main choti si bhoomika bhi he or ye bhoomika bhi mardon ko aakarshith karne vaali he
 The comments idhar, ranbir bhi film main kuch kanphyus ashiq kii bhoomika main hai do mahabuubaaon, aishwarya raay or anoushka sharma, ke bich or tabhi sani kaa kirdaar ranbir kii zindagi main pravesh karegaa
 Sunny had earlier complained that big filmmakers and big stars do not want to work with her, which is going away now, because the film also has superstars like Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai and big filmmakers like Karan Johar
 lihaaja, shooting dekhne ke uddeshy se hi sahi, katrina kaiff bhi us samay ranbir ke saath ho sakati hai
 Actually, Ranbir and Sunny Leone are going to do an item song together for the film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 sani is gane main kuch vaisaa karti nazar aaengi, jis tarah film 'don' main hellen ne amitabh bachchan ke saath kiya tha
 Along with the song, Sunny also has a small role in the film and this role is also appealing to men
 tippaniyan Here, Ranbir is also playing the role of some Confuse lover in the film between two Mehboobaas, Aishwarya Rai and Anushka Sharma, and then Sunny's character will enter Ranbir's life
 sani kii pehle shikaayat thi ki unke saath bade filmkaar or bade sitare kaam nahin karnaa chaahate, jo ab dur ho rahi he, kyonki is film main ranbir kapur, anoushka sharma or aishwarya raay jaise superstar bhi hai or karan johar jaise bade filmkaar bhi
 Hence, Katrina Kaif may also be with Ranbir at that time, just for the purpose of watching the shooting
 idhar, ranbir bhi film main kuch kanphyus ashiq kii bhoomika main hai do mahabuubaaon, aishwarya raay or anoushka sharma, ke bich or tabhi sani kaa kirdaar ranbir kii zindagi main pravesh karegaa
 Sunny had earlier complained that big filmmakers and big stars do not want to work with her, which is going away now, because the film also has superstars like Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma and Aishwarya Rai and big filmmakers like Karan Johar

 But, UP Congress chief Raj Babbar has shared a video from his Twitter handle in which it said, 'there is a demand from the new government of UP that such acts should not happen

 com / 8dtfxlvr4w - Raj Babbar (@rajbabbarmp) May 1, 2017 Comments darasal, video main ek police vaale kii barbarta dikhaai de rahi he
 It seems that the policeman is affiliated with GRP
 police vaale ne ek buudhe rikhshavala par apni vardi kii takat kaa beja istemaal kar rahaa he
 The policeman drags the rickshawman down from his rickshaw and then drags him inside the outpost
 is daurav rickshaw vaala gir jaataa he
 But the policeman has no pity
 vah apni vardi ke nashe main use ghaseetata he or phir collar se pakadakar use chaowkee ke bheetar le gaya
 The policeman has crossed the limits of vandalism even beyond how the law has been dismantled, when he starts belting or whipping that poor old rickshawala from sleeping inside the outpost
 ashchurch kii baat yah he ki jab vah pulisavaala is ghatana ko anjaam de rahaa tha tab kuch varisht adhikari bhi the jo keval is baat par dhyaan de rahe the ki log video na bana paaen
 Not only this, no one is even giving any assurance of action on it
 kisi garib kii aisi haalat hoti rahi or baaki police waalon kaa aisa vyavhaar aam janata ke liye sharmnaak he
 People say who will stop the policemen orgy
 itane police waalon main ek bhi pulisavaala maanviya samvednaaon ke saath apane kartavya kaa paalan nahin kar saktaa tha
 There is a demand from the new government of UP that such activities should not happen
 zulm or besharmi kii aisi misaalon kaa jawaab janata ko dena aata he

 lag rahaa he ki vah police vaala jiarapy se sambhddha he
 The policeman is using his uniform's strength on an old rickshawala
 police vaale ne rikhshawvale ko uske rickshaw se neeche ghasita or phir ghaseetata hua chaowkee ke bheetar le jaataa he
 This dervish rickshaw falls
 lekin police vaale ko koi taras nahin aata he
 He drags her intoxicated by his uniform and then grabs her by the collar and takes her inside the outpost
 yahaan tak kanoon kii kisi dhajjiyaan udin usase bhi aage jaakar police vaale ne barbarta kii hadein paar kar di jab vah chaowkee ke bheetar sote se us garib buudhe rikhshavala ko belt yaa kodaa maarane lagata he
 The surprising thing is that while the policeman was carrying out the incident, there were some senior officers who were only paying attention that people could not make the video
 itnaa hi nahin koi us par koi karrwai kaa aashwaasan tak nahin de rahaa he
 Such condition of a poor person continued and such behavior of other policemen is shameful for the general public
 logon kaa kahana he ki pulisia tandav ko koun rokegaa
 Not a single policeman could carry out his duty with human sympathies
 upi kii nai sarkaar se ye maang he ki is tarah kii harakatein naa hon

 Both were later apprehended as well as reported to the police

 Arvind Tyagi, who lives in Vikaspuri, West Delhi, while enumerating many problems of his colony, said, 'this election has given us a special opportunity to press the button of' NOTA '
 ' Another voter, on the condition of anonymity, said that the option of 'NOTA' should have been implemented long ago because the 'constitution has guaranteed everyone the right to exercise their authority
 ' Significantly, in September this year, the Supreme Court had ordered to include the 'NOTA' button in the evms so that the voters have the right to press this button and dismiss all the candidates in the election

 safar ke dauraan train main mili ek hindu sainya afasar ke bayaan ke aadhaar par hi samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke rashtriya mahasachiv or akhilesh sarkaar ke kaddavar mantri ajam khan ne kargil vaala gola daaga tha
 This was revealed by Azam Khan himself in an exclusive interview with India Today
 gauratlab he ki ajam khan ne ek vivaadaaspad bayaan diya tha ki kargil yuddh main bharat ko jeet hinduon ne nahin, balki muslim sainikon ne dilaai
 Azam may have come under the radar of his opponents for this statement, but he says that everything i said is completely true
 ajam kehete hai ki mere paas is baat ke pukhta saboot hai or jab jarurat padegi to main inhen sabake saamne pesh bhi kar duungaa
 Azam says that he met a senior army officer a few years ago on the train
 is afasar ne kargil yuddh main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 This Hindu officer told me that when the Indian Army made the first attack on Pakistani soldiers in Kargil, only Muslim soldiers were put forward as a strategy
 ajam ke mutabik, ranneeti yah thi ki musalmaan sainik aage jaakar 'allaa ho akbar' ke naare lagaayenge, jisase paak sena yaa vahaan ke ladaakon ke man main ye shaq paidaa ho jaae ki saamne se unke sainik aa rahe hai
 Or they should understand that there has been a revolt in their troops
 vivaadon main ghire ajam khan ne kaha ki bhopal main rahane vaale in afasar ne mujhe bataaya ki sena kii ye ranneeti kaamyaab rahi
 Hearing the slogan of 'allah ho Akbar', the Pak soldiers came out in grief and then the Indian army attacked them
 khan ne kaha ki jarurat padane par ve us sainik afasar kaa naam or baaki saboot saamne rakh denge
 Khan argued that if Muslims want to stay ahead in sacrificing the country, then even if people have reservations, what should we do
 kerala kaa tiruvanantpuram loksabhaa seat congress kaa ek aisa kila he jo darakta dikh rahaa he
 Here the BJP is continuously strengthening its position
 yah mana ja rahaa he ki kerala main bijepi kaa sookhaa khatm hone kii shuruyaat is seat se hi ho sakati he
 From here, Congress veteran and scholar leader Shashi Tharoor is currently an MP, but he won the last time with great difficulty
 is baar bijepi ne mizoram ke purv governor kummanam rajasekhar ko utaar diya he jisase shashi tharur ke liye muqabla or kadaa dikh rahaa he
 K
 to contest elections from BJP
 rajasekhar governor pad se istipha diya tha
 Although Shashi Tharoor has been active in Thiruvananthapuram seat for a long time, that is why it is not so easy to beat him from here
 congress kaa rahaa he kilakerala ke tiruvanantpuram loksabhaa kshetra main saat vidhansabha siten aati hai-tiruvanantpuram, kazakuttom, vaattiurakau, nemom, kowalam, neyyattinkara or parassla
 The first election after independence was held here in 1951, when the seat was called travancore-cochin
 pehle chunaav main yahaan se nirdaleey ummidavaar enni muscrene jiti thim
 She was a freedom fighter
 uske baad ab tak ke chunaav main yah seat congress kaa garh rahi he
 bjp's growing challenge is currently veteran Congress leader and former minister Shashi Tharoor MP
 yahaan se nau baar congress candidet jitkar saansad bane hai, jabaki chaar baar bhartiya communist party (sipiai) ke candidet jite hai
 However, this stronghold of the Congress is now seen as a saffron challenge
 yahaan se bijepi candidet ko mil rahaa vot percentage lagaataar bad rahaa he or congress candidet ke jeet kaa antar kam hota ja rahaa he
 Last time in the 2014 elections, there seemed to be a time that bjp's account would be opened from this seat in Kerala, but in the end Shashi Tharoor won from barely a few seats
 congress se is baar bhi shashi tharur kaa utarana to pakkaa he, lekin is baar vah kaaphi kathin ladaai main funs sakate hai
 According to local media reports, in the internal survey of the Congress, it is believed that this time it is very difficult for the Congress to win this seat
 isaki vajah yah he ki bijepi ne sabarimala andolan ke dwaara apana aadhaar kaaphi badha liya he, lekin congress ne iske jawaab main koi khaas taiyaari nahin kii he
 PM Modi has reached here many times in the last months
 15 janvari ko piem modi ne yahaan ke shri padmanabha mandir main darshan kiya tha
 This time the BJP will put its full emphasis on those seats where it has got more than two lakh votes in the last election
 inamen se ek tiruvanantpuram seat bhi he
 Jeetashishi Tharoor was also the richest candidate by a low margin, he was 23
 04 karod kii sampatti ghoshit kar rakhi thi
 Shashi Tharoor received just 2,97,806 votes, while BJP candidate O
 rajagopal ko 2,82,336 vot mili the
 In this way, Shashi Tharoor won by a margin of about 15 thousand votes
 unke vot main 2009 ke chunaav ke mukaable kareeb 10 fisadi kii giravat ai thi, jabaki bijepi candidet ke vot main kareeb 21 fisadi kii jabardast badhat hui thi
 Bennett Abraham of the CPI received 2,48,941 votes
 aam aadmi party ke candidet ajit jaay ko 14,153 vot, esadipiai ke kunnil shajahan ko 4,820 vot mili the
 The NOTA button was pressed by 3,346 people
 saal 2009 ke chunaav main congress candidet shashi tharur ko 3,26,725 vot or sipiai candidet pi
 Ramachandran Nair received 2,26,727 votes
 tab bijepi candidet pi

 bispi ke rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki kehete hai, ‘‘duusari partiyon kii tulana main musalamaanon ko sabase zyada tikat dekar bispi ne sabit kar diya he ki yahi iklauti party samaaj ke is tabake kii sabase badi hitaishi he
 "one of the special things about the ticket distribution this time is that the BSP, which gave tickets to three Vaishyas last time, has opted out of them this time
" party ke ek rashtriya mahasachiv bataate hai, ‘‘brahman or thakuron kii tarah vaisya samaaj bispi se nahin jud rahaa he

 In the discontent of the Brahmins after the ticket distribution in the BJP, the SP is looking for an opportunity for itself

 Among the 78 Lok Sabha candidates announced so far, BJP has fielded Brahmin 17, Thakur 14, Dalit 17, Vaishya 3, a Parsi and a Bhumihar
 khaas baat yah he ki party ne ek bhi muslim ummidavaar nahin utaara he
 On the other hand, to take advantage of Jat and Gurjar fraternities standing against Muslims, the party has given preference to Jat and Gurjar candidates in seven seats out of the 22 seats in the West
 uttar pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi kehete hai, ‘‘bijepi ke liye loksabhaa chunaav main vikaas hi ekmaatr agenda he lekin janatantr main jati samoohon ke pratinidhitiv kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati

 Pakistani media has left Shigufa over PM Modi and Nawaz Sharif amid deep tension between India and Pakistan over former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav
 paak media ne daawa kiya he ki june main kazakhtan ke astana main yojit hone vaali shanghai corporation orgenigeshan (SCO) shikhar sammelan main pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif or unke bhartiya samakaksh ke bich mulaakaat ho sakati he
 Relations between the two nuclear-capable neighbors have been strained since Jadhav was hanged on charges of espionage by a Pakistani military court
 aise main sharif or modi kii mulaakaat kii baat gale se nahin utar rahi he
 Because now the situation is not the same
 bharat ne dwipaksheeya vaarta radd karke iske saaf sanket de die hai
 India has even said that if Pakistan hangs Najadhav, he will have to face serious consequences
 da express tribune ne pakistani videsh vibhaag ke aadhikarik or rajanyik sutron ke hawaale se daawa kiya ki SCO shikhar sammelan se itar navaj sharif or modi ke bich mulaakaat kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 The newspaper says that on the sidelines of the summit, the two Prime Ministers can hold talks with each other
 sutron ne kaha ki isse pehle bhi donon deshon ke pradhanmantri tanatani ke bich mulaakaat karke sabko hairaan kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the possibility of a meeting between Nawaz Sharif and PM Modi on the sco summit cannot be ruled out
 bharat-pakistan par SCO ke sadsy deshon kaa dabaavishgau ke prabhaavshaalee sadsy desh bhi pakistan or bharat par phir se baatcheet shuru karne kaa dabaav bana rahe hai, taaki shikhar sammelan sauhaard ke maahaul main yojit ho sake
 Earlier in 2015, PM Modi and Nawaz Sharif met in Ufa, Russia amidst tension between the two countries, which surprised everyone
 akhbaar kaa kahana he ki donon deshon ke piem SCO sadsy deshon ke dabaav main aakar mulaakaat karenge
 Such meetings have been held in an atmosphere of tension before, the Pakistani newspaper claims that the meeting of the Prime Ministers of the two countries is not new, due to the tense atmosphere between India and Pakistan
 isse pehle bhi aise maukon par donon deshon ke pradhanmantri mulaakaat karte aae hai
 In 1998, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee traveled to Lahore by bus after deep tension from India and Pakistan to conduct nuclear tests, so that the peace process between the two countries can be resumed
 haalanki shantivaarta bepatori ho gai thi or saal 1999 main donon deshon ke bich kargil yuddh ho gaya tha
 After this, after the attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, indo-pak soured and war-like situation had arisen, but then the then Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf came to attend the summit held in Agra
 iske baad 2015 main modi or sharif ne rus ke upha main mulaakaat kar sabko hairaan kiya tha

 Talking to Aaj Tak, Prakash Javadekar said that the court has agreed to the fact that the hearing can be held on the basis of illegal papers which have come out
 kai deshon main is tarah ke kanoon he ki avaidh kaaryon ke aadhaar par sunwaayee nahin hoti he
 Against which we believed that a hearing should not be held on the basis of wrongly received papers
 prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki pehle supreme court kah chukaa he ki rafel maamle main koi gadabadi nahin hui he
 The Supreme Court has not withdrawn any of its earlier statements, so Narendra Modi is not speaking wrong when he says that the Supreme Court has justified the Rafale deal
 jabaki rahul gandhi supreme court ke faisle ke aadhaar par chaukeedaar chor he or anil ambani ko 30 hajaar karod rupee de die, is tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai jo ki bilkul supreme court kaa apmaan he
 Could the BJP be troubled by the court's decision? In response, Prakash Javadekar said that there is an atmosphere of Modi in the country and any such hearing is not going to have any effect
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha ki yahaan par sirf log modi ke liye vot dene nikal rahe hai
 The election meetings of Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot are not going to have any effect
 prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki hamaari purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje bhi jaldi prachaar par nikalne vaali hai
 Many places have gone publicity
 hanuman beniwal or karnal kirodi singh bansla jaise jat or gurjar netaaon ko party main lene par unhone kaha bhale hi vah jati vishesh ke netaa he, magar unka janaadhar he or ham bijepi kii jeet ke liye sabhi logon ko party main shaamil kar rahe hai

 input: IANS Former Chief Minister and NDA partner Jeetanram Manjhi is busy in farming after spending his time in his village Mahakar without any worry
 kabhi apni goshaala main gaayon ko dekh rahe hai to kabhi fasal kii katni kaa hisaab le rahe hai
 Before the results, how many concerns are hidden behind this befree and how fast the heartbeat is reflected by the words of Manjhi
 khizrasarai ke mahakar gaanv main kabhi kachche eent kaa makaan ab bangale kii shakl le chukaa he
 The color is dark green and the only house in the village makes it feel that Aapjitan Ram is in Manjike village
 bihar chunaav ke opinian pole par unhone kaha ki koi opinian pole yun hi kah de ki itani siten aaengi ye soch se pare he lekin hamen today chanakya kaopinian polascai se najadik dikhataa he
 Manjhi said, 'we are winning because of three factors - women, youth and Dalit factor
 inhone hamaare paksh main kaam kiya hai
 For the first time, Dalits have voted so aggressively
 inhen teenon factor kii vajah se pole pratishat badhaa he jo endie ke paksh main gaya he
 Before taking a dig at Lalu Prasad, the CM said that Lalu has been giving prey even before
 lalu siton ke bare main jo bol den lekin 8 ke baad yahi lalu kahenge ki narendra modi ne sara iviem badal diya he
 When he was asked about the Manjhi Factor, he said - i do not know about the Manjhi Factor but i can say that my voters were understanding when i spoke
 ye parivartan ke liye nahin balki apmaan kaa badla lene kaa mood dikhaa he
 Unconditional support to the NDA, not in the Chief Minister's race, Jitan Ram Manjhi once again made it clear that he was not in the race to become the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha- 'narendra modi ko jab vachan diya tha to bina shart samarthan dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 i said that i am not a candidate for the Chief Minister, you can make whomever you want to make, but i said that the more seats you give us, the more you will benefit
 kam denge to ghaataa bhi aapako hoga
 He said that other NDA partners have also raised questions regarding seats, but he has always remained calm
 maanjhi ne kaha ki yadi rigelt main unki siten, duusari partiyon ke mukaable zyada raheen to bijepi ko pachhtaawaa hoga ki unhone hamen or siten kyon nahin deen
 He said - if there is a chance of jointly forming a government, then they will have to regret that i wish we had given more seats to Hindustani Awam Morcha
 'nitish-lalu ko dharashaayi karne ko banaai party'bihar ke purv siem ne kaha ki unhone HAM kaa gathan lalu-nitish ko dharashayi karne ke liye kiya he
 There is no justification to accompany or help them
 kam seat aae zyada aae
 We are and will be with the NDA
 'bijepi se zyada hoga HAM kaa strike rate'bijepi ke siem ummidavaar ko lekar unhone kaha ki narendra modi kii baat alag hai
 There will be no Chief Minister in Bihar without Modi's idea
 aise main modi par mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki vah sahi faisla lenge
 Manjhi said - i am not in a position to give an opinion on who will be the CM face of BJP, but if asked, i will definitely give my opinion
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki savarna main kai aise chehre hai jo daliton ke liye sochate hai
 Even among Dalits, they think for the upper castes, whom Narendra Modi will choose and will support him
 maanjhi ne kaha ki agar agadi jati kaa koi netaa siem bane to unhen koi dikkat nahin
 He said- If the forwards had not helped, neither Baba Sabah Ambedkar would have been here nor Jitan Ram Manjhi
 ' jeet ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki meraa striking rate bijepi se bhi zyada hoga
 These are in percentage terms
 agar ham 20 main 17 jeet rahe hai to bijepi ko 150 main kitna or paswan ko kitna jeetna chahie aap dekh lijie
 Opening support to Mohan Bhagwat, Manjhi openly supported RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, saying that Bhagwat did not say anything wrong on reservation and not because Jawaharlal Nehru had said the same in Parliament in 1962 that there should be no renewed thought
 needed
 samiksha kaa matlabaye he ki 16 pratishat aabaadi se zyada bhi to ho saktaa he
 He said that a good man and a true man talks on a big plank but the wrong man presents him in the wrong way
 bhagwat achche aadmi hai unhone acchhee baat rakhi
 He is a thoughtful man, he had no wrong intention
 maanjhi ne yah bhi kaha ki dalit muslim or dalit adivasee kii baat nahin honi chahie, kyonki tab to samvidhan main sanshodhan karnaa padegaa
 Regarding spending time in Mangaon, it seems that in the farming, Manjhi said that there is more mind in the village, so the Chief Minister used to come here again and again
 maanjhi ne bataaya ki unka kheti main bahut man lagata he
 If the elections were defeated, they continued on the strength of agriculture
 unhone kaha, 'chunaav ke pehle meri koi dhadkan nahin badi he main bilkul shant hum
 Till the work was progressing
 gita ke shloke par vishwaas he
 Which calms the mind
 unhone kaha ki chunaav jitkar sarkaar banaaenge to kaaman minimum program banaaange usee par chalenge
 Will implement reservation in private sector
 maanjhi ne yah bhi kaha ki nitish or lalu kii dosti darak rahi he
 After the result, see how it breaks

 Baghdadi started in 2006, after a long battle, the US had liberated Iraq from the clutches of Saddam Hussein
 par is aazaadee ko hasil karne ke dauraan iraq puri tarah barbaad ho chukaa tha
 As the US military left Iraq, many small groups started fighting for their strength
 unheen main se ek gut kaa netaa thebu bakar al bagdadi
 al-qaeda Chief of Iraq
 wo 2006 se hi iraq main apni jameen taiyaar karne main laga tha
 But then he had no money, no help nor fighters
 al-kaayda iraq bana isixaraasala america sena 2011 main jab iraq se lauti, tab tak wo iraqi sarkaar ko barbaad kar chuki thi
 Saddam was killed
 infrastracchar puri tarah se tabah ho chuke the or sabase badi baat ye ki wo iraq main khaali satta chhod gaye the
 Baghdadi could not succeed much due to lack of resources
 haalanki iraq par kabje ke liye tab tak usne al-kaayda iraq kaa naam badal kar nayaa naam iesai yaneeislamic state of irakarakh liya tha
 Desperate from Iraq reached Baghdadi, Syria Baghdadi joined the commander and soldiers of Saddam Hussein's army
 iske baad usne shuruaati nishaanaa police, sena ke daftar, checkpaints or recruiting steshans ko bananaa shuru kiya
 By now thousands of people had joined with Baghdadi, but still Baghdadi was not getting that success in Iraq
 iraq se maayoos hokar bagdadi ne syria kaa rukh karne kaa faisla kiya
 Syria was experiencing civil war
 al-kaayda or free sirian army vahaan ke do sabase bade gut the, jo syrian raashtrapati se morcha le rahe the
 Success not achieved in Syria for four years Baghdadi did not get any major success in Syria even for the first four years
 alabatta is dauraan usne ek baar phir se apane sanghathan kaa naam badal kar abaies (islamic state of iraq and syria)kar diya tha
 On June 2013, the General of the Free Syrian Army first appeared and appealed to the world that if they do not get weapons, they will lose their war with the rebels within a month
 palat gaye iesas ke dinis apil ke hafte bhar ke andar hi america, israel, jordan, turki, saudi arab or katar ne free sirian army ko hathiyaar, paise, or training kii madad deni shuru kar di
 These countries have delivered all the modern weapons, anti-tank missiles, ammunition and everything to Syria and it is from here that the days of ISIS overturned
 darasal jo hathiyaat free sirian army ke liye the, wo saal bhar ke andar iesas tak ja pahunche kyonki tab tak aies free sirian army main send laga chukaa tha or uske bahut se log uske saath ho liye the
 Also, IS deceived the world by wearing the mask of Freedom Fighter in Syria
 isi nakaab kii aad main khud america tak ne anjaane main aies ke aatankwaadiyon ko training de daali
 knowing-unknowingly America's Hand Behind the birth of ISIS, America's hand was unknown
 thik vaise hi jaise america kii madad kii vajah se osama bin laden or al-kaayda kaa janm hua
 Just like in 1980, the US made Saddam Saddan Hussein by providing chemical weapons for use against Iran
 thik vaise hi syria ke freedom fiter ko america ne hathiyaar or training di or ab vahi freedom fiter iesas ke binar tale lard rahe hai
 Snowden's Big Reveal in 2013july Edward Snowden's interview to the Iranian newspaper Tehran Times in 2014 reveals another theory of US help in boosting IS

 According to Snowden, the United States, Britain and Israel together strengthened Baghdadi's organization Isis
 israel ne di bagdadi ko hathiyaar chalaane kii trainingis plan ko bihive yani madhumakhi kaa chhatta code nem diya gaya
 The aim was to create such a force of terrorism in the countries around Israel in which anti-israel countries remain entangled and Israel should be safe
 snowden ke mutabik israel ne khud saal bhar bagdadi ko hathiyaar chalaane kii training di
 America itself attacked its enemies in the Middle East from Baghdadi and sent its forces to these countries by spreading terror in the Central Asian countries
 syria, libya or iraq teenon hi tel ke lihaaj se kaaphi amir hai
 It is said about America that the US pushed ISIS to extract oil from there and in this, the US helped Saudi Arabia and Turkey

 The victims' families were angry that the police were yet to trace the attackers
 vahiin, police kaa kahana he ki gaanv kaa koi bhi aage aakar kuch bataane ko taiyaar nahin
 In such a situation, the police is having a lot of trouble in investigating
 karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ne bijepi main vaapasi karne ke spasht sanket die hai
 Yeddyurappa, dissatisfied with the BJP, had exerted full power to oust the party's government in the state, but now he is attacking the ruling Congress
 rajya vidhansabha main mangalvaar ko yediurppa or bijepi ke vidhayakon ke bich talmail dikhaai diya
 The former Chief Minister, who split from the BJP and formed his own party 'karnataka Janata Paksha' last year, said in the House, 'we made a mistake
 hamaari galtiyon kii vajah se rajya kii janata ne congress kii sarkaar ko chunaa jabaki log aisa nahin chaahate the
 We have learned a lesson
 loksabhaa chunaavon main ham aapako 7-8 siton tak simit kar denge or sattapaksh main baithne ke liye yojana or kaarykram banaaenge
 Please be patience
 ’vah purv vidhansabha adhyaksh ke aar ramesh kumaar kii is tippanee par pratikriya de rahe the ki rajya kii janata kaise bhul sakati he ki bijepi ne satta main rahete hue kya kiya tha
 Yeddyurappa's statement indicates his growing proximity to the BJP
 varsh 1990 main ayodhya golicond ke baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ko hindutvvaadi sanghathanon or bhaajapa ke netaaon ne mullah mulaayam kahkar sambodhit kiya tha
 This address became the biggest strength of Mulayam Singh and Muslim became a permanent vote bank for Mulayam Singh Yadav, who ruled the hearts of Yadavs
 lekin is baar lagata aisa he ki 26 saal purana yah talmail ab ladkadaane laga he
 Uttar Pradesh has a Samajwadi Party government and Mulayam Singh Yadav's son Akhilesh Yadav is the chief minister of the state
 lekin chunaav ke pehle kii raajnneetik umas sanket detii he ki samaajawaadee party ke saath musalmaan pehle jaisaa patibaddh he, aisa maananaa galat he
 Mulayam has lost the trust of Muslims on many occasions, from the riots of Muzaffarnagar to Dadri, the Samajwadi Party has lost the trust of Muslims on many occasions
 mulaayam apane pichley kuch vaktavyon or faislon main hindu matadaataaon ko rijhaane kii koshish karte bhi najar aae hai
 These things have also hurt Muslims and Mulayam's credibility is also weak
 ab bhi baaki he kuch ummidahaalanki mulaayam singh yadav se musalamaanon kaa puri tarah mohabhang ho gaya ho, aisa bhi nahin he
 Netaji is still the first choice of a large Muslim population
 lekin musalamaanon ke jehan main ek sawaal yah bhi he ki modi ko rokane ke liye wo kiske saath jaaen or kya netaji yaa unki party is baar uttar pradesh main dobaaraa sattashin hone kii sthiti main he
 If not, should they waste their vote by sitting on the cycle of Mulayam Singh Yadav or should they go to a party that can stop Modi's chariot
 is vyakulata komayawatine bakhubi bhampa he
 And Mayawati, who was hurt by the pundits in 2012, is seen working on the dalit-muslim equation this time
 yahi kaaran he ki satish mishra se bhi zyada pramukhataa party nasimuddin siddiqui or munkad ali ko de rahi he
 These two confidant faces of Mayawati are raising the BSP flag among their community
 varsh 2014 kii modi lahar ke baad musalamaanon kaa man yah he ki kisi aise ke saath khadey hon jo modi ke rath ko 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main roak sake
 In such a situation, Mayawati has emerged as an effective alternative to Muslims
 unhone mujffarnagar main haal hi main paidaa hue tanaav main musalamaanon ko aashwast kiya ki wo unke saath hai
 Netaji and Congress failed to do so
 jab bahanji ne diya musalamaanon kaa sathtripal talaak par jab modi ne tippanee kii to mayawati turant musalamaanon ke paksh main utrin or kaha ki kisi sampradaay ke mudde usee sampradaay ke log hal karen, wo zyada behatar he
 Mayawati continues to send a message to Muslims that the right name for representation of Akhliyat in the state is that of Mulayam Singh Yadav or Congress
 or iskaa asar bhi dikh rahaa he
 From the rally in Purvanchal to the assembly of Saharanpur, the presence of a large number of Muslims like Dalits was also seen
 yah badhat or mayawati ke prati yah vishwaas sapa or bhaajapa ko khaasaa baichaiyn kar rahaa he
 In fact, the Muslim support that Mayawati is getting, could have been given to the Congress party as well
 lekin congress par yakeen karnaa langade ghode par daanv lagane jaisaa he
 The Congress itself is fighting for its survival
 aise main wo kisi samudaay kii suraksha kii guarantee le sakati he yaa phir kisi lahar yaa aandhi ko roak sakati he, isaki gunjaaish na ke baraabar he
 Mayawati can get strength Mayawati has emerged as a big caretaker of Muslims in anti-bjp parties
 mulaayam singh yadav ke kunbe kii ladaai ne musalamaanon ko basapa kii ore or teji se dhakela he
 If this attraction can be converted into a vote, then Mayawati can emerge as the strongest

 The dispute between the Delhi government and LG is not being named
 aam aadmi party ne alji par nishaanaa sadhate hue aarope lagaaya ki unhone dilli police ke kamishnar ko chitthee likhakar dilli sarkaar ke mantriyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedane ko kaha he
 The police commissioner has been asked how mlas like Amanatullah of Delhi are getting acquitted? AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj, while making serious allegations against the Center and LG, said that the Delhi Police is being pressured to arrest the mlas on a false charge and defame the party
 aam aadmi party kaa aarope he ki dilli police jhuthe aarope main vidhayakon ko giraftaar kar rahi he
 a conspiracy is being hatched to discredit the party by hype the arrest of mlas
 iske alaava sabhi vidhayakon ke maamle fast trek court main daale ja rahe hai, lekin sabhi vidhayakon ko court se sidhe raahat mil rahi he jisase centre or alji ko jatke lag rahe hai
 According to the party spokesperson false allegations, Chief Minister Kejriwal is being questioned on a false allegation
 aam aadmi party kaa aarope he ki centre sarkaar safataur par uski party ko khatm karnaa chaahati he
 The party claims that LG has filed a letter on May 9, the special people about whom the commissioner has been asked to report include Manish Sisodia, Kailash Gehlot, Amanutullah Khan, Naresh Balayan, Manoj Kumar Kundali MLA besides Chief Minister Kejriwal
 Huh
 saurabh ne kaha ki alji umr ke is padaav main aisi ghatiya or ochhi raajnneeti kar rahe hai jinase unki umr kaa koi aadmi sharmasaar ho
 At the same time, senior party leader Atishi said that the officers are stopping the work of CCTV
 ek taraf hoicourt ke jawaab main dilli police daawa karti he ki dilli main 2 lakh sisitivi camere lage hai
 On the other hand, when asked by the Delhi government, it is said that Delhi Police will install cameras under CSR, in such a situation what is the ground truth Delhi Police should tell
 party ne aarope lagaaya ki agar alji ke ghar sisitivi laga ho to use aam logon kii suraksha main nahin gina ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that in a lawsuit by Delhi High Court Chief Justice Geeta Mittal, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the police and said that there is so much crime here today because the work done by the police to get CCTV cameras is not done by Delhi Police
 So there is no problem
 centre ke liye kaam kar rahi pulicedusri ore, mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash pitayee maamle main mukhyamantri kejariwal or dilli police ke bich takaraar shuru ho gai he
 Kejriwal has written a letter asking for questioning at his government residence at 5 pm and has also asked that a video of the inquiry be made

 He has also sought a copy of the recording from the police, but the police has made it clear that no permission will be given to the video recording on their behalf
 police khud video recording karavaaegi
 AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj says that by doing this the officers who keep silence for 5 minutes at work are stopping the work of the government
 aap ne kaha ki mantri ke saath hathapayee hui, usko peeta gaya
 CCTV in Delhi Secretariat has the appearance and video of people but there was no action for 3 months

 Saurabh says that those who work inside the Chief Minister's Office were questioned for hours, now the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister will also be questioned
 karnataka prakaran par aap party pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki ajay maakan aksar aam aadmi party ko gyaan dete hai, pawan kheda bhi bahut gyaan dete hai, shila dikshit tai bhi hamen bahut gyaan detii hai ki dekhie LG se bana ke rakhie, governor se mukhyamantri ke aise rishte hona chahie ki governor aapkaa kaam karen
 He said that the party giving knowledge to others should look into itself

 The rest of the Chief Ministers of Congress should learn how to form good relations with the Governor

 jaipur ke indian oil depo main aag lagane se pehle kya hua tha
 Aaj Tak has found the only eyewitness to this incident in its investigation
 chashmadid ke mutabik us din indian oil se tel bipisiel ko diya ja rahaa tha lekin tabhi volve zyada khul gaya
 Eyewitness IOC employee is a person who is closely watching the horrific fire at the depot of Hazipur, IOC operations manager Ashok Gupta who is undergoing treatment at Manesar, Jaipur
 oparation manager ashok gupta ne hi company ke do karmchaariyon ko line kholane ke liye kaha tha lekin us din volve kuch zyada hi khul gaya tha
 Ashoka only remembers that there was a heavy oil spill which made him unconscious
 tel ghotaale kii ashankasbase bada sawaal yah he ki kya petrol line kholane ke liye ijaajat lee gai thi yaa nahin or volve kholane ke liye kahkar ashok duusari taraf kyon chale gaye? ye baaten isliye ahm he kyonki tel ke len-dein main kai baar ghotaale kii baaten bhi saamne ai hai or sibiai pehle se hi 1 lakh 28 hajaar litre tel chori ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The old merge of Uttarakhand has emerged once again
 pahaado kii shaan samajhe jane vaale guldaar (tendue kii ek prajati) gaanvon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 This time their floor is not goats and hill dogs
 ve to behad aasaan or sust shikaar yani insaan kii gardan par kisi bhi vakt daant gadaane kii firaaq main hai
 That is why, on 6 October, when the hunter Lakhpat Rawat's gun went off and cannibalistic Guldar's chest was shattered in Didihat area of pithoragarh district, people started cheering the hunter
 isse thik do din pehle mashhoor shikari joy hukil ne ravat ke saath milakar is guldaar kii jodidar maadaa ko thikaane lagaaya tha
 On 28 September, after killing another cannibal guldar in neighboring Pauri Garhwal, Hukil reached Pithoragarh for the next hunt
 aakhir jate kyon nahin, in donon jilo main ye narbhakshi guldaar 15-15 se zyada logon ko apana nishaanaa bana chuke the
 The struggle between animals and humans has descended from the thick forests of Uttarakhand and gone to the villages
 agar gaiyr aadhikarik aankadon par gaur karen to uttarakhand main 2000 se 2014 ke bich kareeb 400 log guldaar yaa kisi duusare junglee jaanavar ke hamale main maare gaye
 At the same time, the figure of the injured is beyond one thousand
 uttarakhand hi kya, desh ke alag-alag ilaakon main tendue or insaan kaa sangharsh bad rahaa he
 It has not been long since an unannounced curfew situation arose in Meerut city of Uttar Pradesh as a leopard roamed the city and the entire police force followed him
 vah dukaanon main ghusaa, bank atm ke sisitivi camere main kaid hua, jila aspataal ke immergency ward main ghumaa or phir aspataal kii jaali todakar ojhal ho gaya
 Leopards are often seen walking in areas near the Kaliasot Dam in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh
 or desh kii audyogic rajdhani mumbai to jaise tendue or insaan ke shahari sangharsh kii sabase badi haldighati ban gai he
 Many cities of Maharashtra are struggling with this crisis
 is sangharsh main desh bhar main 2011 main 358, 2012 main 331 or 2013 main 327 tendue bemaut maare gaye
 This second aspect of the data is your eye so that it is difficult to identify the victim side here
 uttarakhand main afatlekin jiske sir par tendue kii afat tuutati he, uske jakhmon ko aankadon kaa yah santulan bhar nahin saktaa
 Recalling the day of September 28, 14-year-old Reena of Maletha village in Pauri Garhwal says, “me and my mother Maheshwari Devi were cutting grass with 12-14 women
 achaanak guldaar ne maa par hamalaa kar diya
 Guldar ran away, but his teeth proved to be fatal in his mother's neck
 ” yah maadaa guldaar isse pehle 22 sitambar ko bhi gaanv main 36 varshiya guddi devi kii hatya kar chuki thi
 Then people noticed that the female is not alone, but she also has two cubs
 1,700 meter kii oonchai par chid, banj or burans ke pedo se ghire gaanv ke log 60 kimi dur jila mukhyalay paudi main jiladhikari kaa gheraav karne pahunch gaye
 People demanded that the village be declared zero leopard zone
 jiro lepard jone yani gaanv main ek bhi tendua na ho
 However, the government order reads, "only cannibal guldar be killed
 ”(gramin yuvakon ke saath shikari joy hukil)yahi aadesh 28 sitambar ko guldaar ke duusare hamale ke baad kaam aayaa
 The hunter Hukil hurriedly set up a site of hunting for guldar
 unhen bharosa tha ki apana adhuraa shikaar dhundne maadaa guldaar jarur waapas aegi
 He sat for hours and hours
 din dhal gaya
 He became hunter and checker
 use pataa tha ki prakritik shikari din dhale ek chakkar lagane jarur aayega
 At quarter to seven, Guldar came and Hukil shot right
 maadaa guldaar dher ho gai
 But people fear that even more cannibals may become gullible
 isliye jiladhikari chandrashekhar bhatta ne bharosa dilaayaa, “jab tak sthiti saamaanya nahin ho jaati, forest ranger or van vibhaag kii team gaanv main hi maujuud rahegi
 "but such promises have been made even earlier
 paudi ke chaar gaanv ke logon ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main matdaan kaa bahishkaar tak kar diya tha
 These people were protesting the death of Vikas Dhasmana, a student of class nine of Khandoda village, in the attack on Guldar
 lekin van vibhaag kii jang lagi bandooken ab aise van rakshakon ke kandhe par hai jinhen ab tak bandook chalaane kii training hi nahin mili he
 On this fact, District Forest Officer Rajmani Pandey says, "if not training what happened, if Guldar comes, he will fire the gun
" ” yahaan yah baat jaan lene main bhi harj nahin he ki gasht ke samay ye bandooken lod nahin rahati
 Three cages are definitely kept in the village to catch another guldar
 lekin koi guldaar in pinjaron ke kareeb nahin fatak rahaa
 Over time, the shy Guldar has also become defiant
 (maare gaye guldaar ke saath gramin)guldaar ko maaraa mobileguldaar se vahi batch pate hai jinaki kismat buland hoti he
 a similar fate was of 19-year-old Deepak Kumar of Kinkhola village in Devprayag development block
 deepak vakya sunaate hai, “main gaanv ke paas timary tok ke jangalon main bakrii charaane gaya tha
 Suddenly Guldar attacked
 mujhe kuch samaj nahin aayaa or maine apana mobile phenkakar guldaar ko maar diya
 Perhaps this distracted Guldar and i ran away making noise
 haalanki guldaar ne do bakriyaan maar deen, lekin jaan to batch gai
 "similarly, on August 24, 12-year-old Abhishek of Rensoli village also escaped from Guldar's lunge
 ghatana se uske mata-pita itane dar gaye ki bachche ko sthaayee rup se uski nanihaal bhej diya
 Abhishek's mother Sunita Devi takes a deep breath, "we cannot test luck again and again
 baccha surakshit rahe, pard-likh to baad main bhi jayega
 "similarly, you will find stories of freshness where a woman kills Guldar with his sickle
 lekin kahaniyaan jahaan bhi sunne ko milengi, usamen sanyog or hausala hoga, prashasan kii ore se di gai training yaa koi suniyojit pahal nahin hogi
 And in such a way that Guldar has come close to the life of the people, in this people will also have to learn new ways of living
 badal rahaa he tenduon kaa mizaajahausala badhaane vaale in vaakyon ke baavjood yah sawaal apni jagah bana hua he ki tendue ke hamale aakhir bad kyon rahe hai
 See first opinion about this hunter who has been killing leopards in Uttarakhand for seven years
 ve kehete hai, “maine jo 15 guldaar maare hai unamem se aadhe puri tarah swasth the or unke narbhakshi hone kii koi atirikt vajah nahin thi
 Then he reminds that there has been a large scale migration in villages of Uttarakhand and farming has also reduced
 aise main tendue jangal main na rahakar gaanvon ke aasapaas hi bas gaye hai
 80 per cent of Guldar is dependent on cattle for food
 yani aadmi ne agar tenduon kaa prakritik awaas badal diya he to tenduon ne bhi nae awaas ke hisaab se khud ko dhaal liya he
 As such, leopards are considered the biggest hoax among the animals of the cat species
 guldaar / tenduon ke is badale swabhaav par wild life socity, india se judi paryaavaranvid vidya athareyaa ke netritv main 2013 main maharashtra main ek vistrut surveykshan kiya gaya
 In the survey conducted in Akole tehsil of Ahmednagar district, 40 cameras were fitted in an area of 179 sq km
 in camaron ne ek maheene ke bheetar tenduon kii 81 upasthiti darj kin
 This showed that five male and six female leopards are living permanently in the area
 ghani aabaadi vaali akole tehsil main tenduon kaa jansankhya ghanatv rajaji neshnal park main tenduon ke ghanatv se zyada paaya gaya
 The special thing is that leopards did not attack any human in the studied area
 adhyayan main bataaya gaya ki hamaari jaankaree ke baahar tendue gaanvon ke aasapaas or ganne ke kheton main sthaayee rup se apana ghar bana chuke hai
 They have become accustomed to life here
 adhyayan main idicollar lage ek tendue kaa bada dilachasp vyavhaar saamne aayaa
 Athreya told, “this leopard used to come near a house every night and after stopping for some time, it went away
 haalanki ghar waalon ko yah kabhi pataa nahin chalaa ki koi tendua unke ghar ke itane kareeb rahata he
 "this vicious Vidal may have got so engrossed in the human world so slowly, but governments and common people are still not very aware of it
 haal yah he ki baaghon ke sangrakshan ke naam par karodon ru
 Spending governments have not yet calculated the population of leopards
 wild life protection socity of india ke mutabik desh main tenduon kii aabaadi 7,000 se 10,000 ke bich he
 ber-kerr's Senior Director of Sangwilde Life Conservation Society, India, Dr
 ashraf in nae tathyon kii roshni main kehete hai, “jo baat maharashtra main sabit ho chuki he, vah uttarakhand ke liye bhi sahi ho sakati he
 When humans change their habitat, animals also change themselves accordingly
 ganga ke maidaanon ko jab kheton main badla gaya to hiran or duusare shaakaahaari jeev mit gaye, lekin nilgai ne khud ko iske hisaab se dhaal liya
 Similarly leopards in big cats learned to live in a changed habitat
 ve ab gaanvon ke paas hi rahete hai or maveshi unka bhojan hai
 In such a situation, if there is an attack on human beings, then it is not surprising
 tendue ke hamale ko lekar ve kehete hai, “desh main sadak durghatnaon main har saal lakhon log maare jate hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki log har durghatana ke baad driver kii hatya kar den yaa gadipoon main aag laga den yaa desh main trephic band kar diya jaae
 "they remind that there is immediate compensation for death and insurance of vehicles
" aise main jaanavar ke hamale main logon kii maut ke maamle main bhi beemaa or tatkaal samuchit muaavje kii suvidha ho
 That is, there is no choice but caution
 aise halaat main uttarakhand ho yaa mumbai, hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki in khoonkhaar junglee billiyon ko hamane hi apane bahut kareeb aane ke liye majaboor kiya he

 She calls Abhi and says that she is his friend and not a nurse who cares for him so much
 is par abhi usase kahata he ki vah jal rahi he isliye aisa kah rahi he
 Tanu's mind decides that she will not leave Abhi and Pragya alone
 iske baad abhi usase kahata he ki vah pragna kaa khyaal rakh legaa vah jaakar apana kaam kare
 He thinks in his mind that he feels that there is a connection between him and Pragya
 duusari taraf, purab ko dekhakar aalia apana rasta badalane kii koshish karti he
 However, Purba catches her and says that her plan to separate Abhi and Pragya has failed and now they will reunite the two
 is dauraan tanu vahaan aati he or aalia ko bataati he ki abhi pragna kaa uske pati kii tarah khyaal rakh rahaa he
 Hearing this, East laughs and Aaliya leaves angrily
 vahiin purab pragna se milane jaataa he to vah use bataati he ki abhi uske liye soup lene gaya he or uskaa bahut khyaal rakh rahaa he
 Hearing Abhi's voice, East starts going from there but Abhi tells him to take care of Pragya
 par purab jaruri kaam kaa bahaanaa banaakar vahaan se nikal jaataa he
 After this Abhi gives Pragya the soup with her hands, East sees it all through the door and becomes very happy for both of them
 tippaniyan Tanu cannot sleep at night thinking about Abhi and Pragya
 vah sochati he ki vah pragna se adhik sundar, adhik smart he lekin phir bhi pataa nahin kyon abhi ko pragna usase zyada acchhee lagati he
 Tanu plans that she will include Rocky, who launched Abhi in the industry, and will make Abhi realize that Pragya is quite old fashioned and does not match her status
 vah agali subah use ghar par bulaati he
 Alia is shocked to see Rocky in the morning when Tanu tells her her plan
 baad main vah rocky se kahati he ki vah abhi ko samajhaae ki pragna uske liye thik nahin he, par vah kahata he ki pragna abhi kii patni he or vah uske saath aisa nahin kar saktaa he
 At this she tells him that Abhi has forgotten Pragya after her memory loss and now she and Tanu are engaged
 tanu ke kaaphi jor dene ke baad rocky uski madad ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he, haalanki purab un donon kii baat sun letaa he
 On the other hand, Alia tries to change her path by looking at the east
 haalanki purab use pakad letaa he or kahata he ki abhi or pragna ko alag karne kaa uskaa plan fail ho gaya he or ab vah un donon ko waapas milakar rahegaa
 Meanwhile Tanu comes there and tells Alia that Abhi is taking care of Pragya like her husband
 yah sun purab hansane lagata he or aalia gusse main vahaan se chali jaati he
 While Purba goes to meet Pragya, she tells him that Abhi has gone to get soup for him and is taking care of him a lot
 abhi kii aawaaj sun purab vahaan se jane lagata he par abhi usase kahata he ki vah pragna kaa khyaal rakhe
 But the East escapes from there, making excuses for important work
 iske baad abhi pragna ko apane haathon se soup pilaataa he, purab yah sab daravaaje se jhankkar dekhtaa he or donon ke liye behad khush ho jaataa he
 The comments raat main abhi or pragna ke bare main sochate hue tanu ko neend nahin aati
 She thinks that she is more beautiful, smarter than Pragya but still doesn't know why Abhi likes Pragya more than him
 tanu plan banaati he ki vah rocky ko, jisane abhi ko industry main launch kiya tha, is plan main shaamil karegi or uske jariye abhi ko yah ahsaas dilaaegi ki pragna kaaphi old faishand he or uske states ko match nahin karti
 She calls him at home the next morning
 subah rocky ko dekh aalia chaunk jaati he tab tanu use apana plan bataati he
 She later asks Rocky to explain to Abhi that Pragya is not good for her, but he says that Pragya is Abhi's wife and cannot do the same to her
 is par vah use bataati he ki yaaddaasht jane ke baad abhi pragna ko bhul chukaa he or ab uski or tanu kii sagaai ho chuki he
 After Tanu insists heavily, Rocky agrees to help him, though East hears them both
 vahiin purab pragna se milane jaataa he to vah use bataati he ki abhi uske liye soup lene gaya he or uskaa bahut khyaal rakh rahaa he
 Hearing Abhi's voice, East starts going from there but Abhi tells him to take care of Pragya

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni credited the big win against England in two consecutive matches to a large extent to the young players on Monday that these cricketers played well in the absence of many big names
 dhoni ne duusare match main aath wicket kii joardaar jeet ke baad kaha, jeet hameshaa mahatvapurn hoti he or jab yah jeet yuvaaon ke dam par milti he to vah khaas ho jaati he
 i am happy that the young players performed well in times of need
 ham antarrashtriya str par balle or gend se unase jaise pradarshan kii ummid kar rahe the ve vaisaa kar rahe hai
 The Indian captain specifically mentioned fast bowlers r Vinay Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Virat Kohli and spinners
 unhone kaha, jeet kaa shrey puri team ko jaataa he lekin yuvaaon kaa yogadan ahm rahaa
 India is playing in this match in the absence of players like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan
 dhoni ne kohli ke bare main kaha, usne vastav main bahut acchhee ballebaaji kii
 He is young and needed to be given more opportunities to bat in the upper order so that he gets a chance to turn a good start into a big score
 usamen ab bhi sudhaar kii jarurat he lekin mujhe vishwaas he ki jis tarah se usne samay ke saath apane khel main sudhaar jari rakhaa he, vah aage bhi aisa karegaa
 Dhoni said, Gambhir's innings at number three was very important
 england ke gendbaajon ko us samay halki swing mil rahi thi or aise main wicket par jame rahanaa ahm tha
 Gautam played a brilliant innings
 unke or kohli ke bich kii saajhedaari ne vastav main match kuch had tak ekatarfa kar diya
 He said of Yadav that he is bowling continuously at speeds of 130 and 140 km
 lekin gati hi sab kuch nahin hoti he
 He will also have to learn accuracy, bouncer, yorker and variance if needed
 ummid he ki anubhav milane par vah inhen sikhta rahegaa
 Along with this, he will also have to avoid injury so that he never misses a match due to injury
 dhoni ne kaha, ham vinayakumar or praveen ke yogadan ko nahin bhul sakate
 They gave us success in the beginning and then the bowlers did not let any long partnership be formed
 yah kaaphi mahatvapurn rahaa
 When Dhoni was asked that India is registering a good win on their land while they could not do so in England, he said, "I cannot give a reason for this
" iske kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 i think the conditions there were not favorable to our spinners while they are the main part of our attack
 iske alaava vahaan dakworth louis ke kaaran bhi hamaari kuch match main haar hui
 Regarding coach Duncan Fletcher's contribution to these victories, he said, Fletcher has made a great impact
