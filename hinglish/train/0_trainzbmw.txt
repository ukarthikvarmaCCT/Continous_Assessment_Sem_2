 After plastic, thermocol has emerged as a new challenge for the environment
 donon hi saamaanya dhang se nasht nahin hote
 The increasing use of plates made of thermocol in the event of eating and drinking not only poses a risk of deteriorating health due to the carcinogenic elements found in it, but they are not rotting, hence the challenge of environmental pollution is also being raised
 isi chintaa ne 42 varshiya vedakrishna jhunjhunwaala ko kuch nayaa karne kii prerana di
 Ved asked for expensive machines from abroad in his paper factory located at Darshannagar on faizabad-azamgarh road
 in mashiinon ne ganne kii lugdi ko platon kaa aakaar diya
 In one day, 8 to 10 lakh plates were made from sugarcane pulp, which is not made anywhere in this country
 veda bataate hai, ''hamaari in platon par bhojan kariye
 After this, bury them in the ground
 ye aapke sehat kii raksha to karengi hi, kuch hi samay main khaad main tabdeel hokar jameen kii urvartaa bhi badha dengi
 "three paper factories, three sugarcane pulp making machines, two power plants, chemical recovery units, egg trays within a campus spread over 80 acres of land in Darshannagar, a backward-looking town of Faizabad
" The plant is not the second in the country to have more than a dozen different factories including sugarcane pulp making factory
 faijabad main jhunjhunwaala parivaar kaagaj ke kaarobaar ke liye janaa jaataa he
 However, initially Ved's grandfather Vishnudayal Jhunjhunwala entered the business world through a sugar mill
 unhone 1930 ke dashak main udyogpati kamalapati singhania ke saath milakar kanpur main ek chini mil lagaai
 It was a 'conversion unit' in which sugar was made from jaggery
 faijabad or uske aasapaas kaa ilaaka ganne kii kheti ke liye prasiddh tha
 For this, Vishnudayal started a sugar mill of his own in the draft area here
 dhire-dhire kaarobaar badaae laga or vishnudayal ne teen or chini milen shuru kin
 Vishnudayal had six sons, of whom Krishna Kumar Jhunjhunwala, Veda's father, was the youngest
 krishnakumar masauda chini mil main hi lagi dafti banane ke kaarkaane kaa kaam dekhte the
 In 1976, Vishnudayal's family was divided
 krishna kumaar ke haath kuch khaas na aayaa
 He also tried his hand at farming but was not successful
 aakhirkaar 1981 main krishna kumaar ne apane chote bete yash ke naam se 'yash papers privet limited' naam kii company banaai
 Along with this he earned Rs one crore
 kii laagat se faijabad-azamgarh road ke kinare darshananagar main kaagaj banane kaa chota kaarkaana shuru kiya, jahaan paanch ton kaagaj roj banataa tha
 Lottery was in practice at that time
 is kaarkaane main lottery tikat ke kaagaj ko 'ricycle' karke usase kaagaj banaaya jaataa tha
 Gradually, this business gained momentum
 chaar saal baad 1985 main baad krishna kumaar ne ganne kii lugdi se kaagaj banane kaa kaarkaana bhi darshananagar main shuru kiya
 After this, in 1991, another paper mill was set up
 darshananagar main lagi kaagaj kii factory deshbhar main prasiddhi paane lagi
 Here 30 to 35 tons of paper were made daily
 jaise-jaise kaagaj kaa kaarobaar bad rahaa tha, usee anupaat main bijli kii khapat bhi bad rahi thi
 Krishna Kumar 30 to 35 Lakhs
 maheenaa sirf bijli ke mad main hi kharch kar rahe the
 In 1997, he took a revolutionary decision
 kaagaj ke kaarkaane main lage bwoiler chaaval kii bhusi se chalaae ja rahe the
 Krishna Kumar also installed a two and a half megawatt power plant running with rice husk with a paper plant
 yash papers khud kaa power plant lagane vaali uttar bharat kii pehali company bani
 This unique power plant is based on 'extraction Condensing Technology', in which the same steam is used to run the turbine and heat the paper produced in the factory
 power plant ne puri kshamta par kaam karnaa shuru kiya to krishna kumaar ne kaarkaanon ke sabhi bahari bijli conection 1999 main band kara die
 At that time, Krishna Kumar's elder son Ved Jhunjhunwala was studying at the University of North London
 vishvavidhyalay se veda ne spotrs management or political iconomics ke course kiye
 In 1994, due to open heart surgery, Krishna Kumar started getting sick
 kaarobaar main rujhaan bhi lagaataar ghatata ja rahaa tha
 Krishna Kumar's sons were also not showing interest in handling their ancestral business
 bade bete veda kii ichha adventure spotrs main jane kii thi to chota betaa yash 'hospitality sector' kii naukari chhodie ko taiyaar nahin tha
 For some time Krishnakumar found buyers for his business but could not find any
 pita kii haalat dekh aakhirkaar veda jhunjhunwaala 1997 main kaarobaar sanbhaalane ko raji hue or do varsh baad unhone puraa kaamkaaj apane kandhon par le liya
 Since then, a period of experimentation and incorporation of new technology began in the paper business
 kooking, lugdi banane ke tareekon main sudharkar kaagaj kii gunvattta badhaai gai
 "in the last years of the 1990s, Yash Papers did not export even a bit of paper," says Ved
 hamane is par dhyaan diya
 Within a few years we started exporting more than 20 percent
 '' aaj europe, america ke saath duniya ke kai deshon main yash papers ke kaagaj kaa niryaat hota he
 Yash Papers Rs 30 crores by 2003
 kii company ban gai thi
 From here the outline of the expansion of Yash Papers was made
 yash papers ne dakshin bharat kii company kaveri papers kaa adhigrahan karne ke baad uski kuch mashiinon ko darshananagar ke kaarkaane main sthapit kiya
 "we were trying to set up a separate plant to make paper to be used in the food and pharmaceutical sector, for which at least Rs 80 crore," says Ved
 kii jarurat thi
 "ved raised funds in 2005 by bringing loans from banks and a public issue of Yash Papers on the Bombay Stock Exchange
" paanch varsh tak utaar-chadhaav dekhne ke baad 2010 main sthirataa ai or yash paper ne mcdonald, cafe coffee de, pizzahat jaise brand ke alaava sargical glavj, banded main prayog hone vaale kaagaj bananaa shuru kiya
 In this way Yash Papers became the first company in North India to make such different types of paper
 itane par bhi veda santusht nahin the
 He explains, "we were selling the 'biodegradable' (naturally dissolving) paper companies, putting plastic or other chemicals on them and destroying the original character of the paper
" hamane aisa product banane kii sochi, jo dharti par pratikul asar na paidaa kare
 "last year, Vedas bought state-of-the-art machines from the Chinese company of Geo Tegrity to make utensils from sugarcane pulp
 ganne kii lugdi se banane vaale in bartanon ko 'chamya brand' ke naam se launch kiya gaya
 "by next year, we will start making a product using mushrooms which will be a safer alternative to thicker thermocol used in packing large items like fridge, TV," says Ved
 ham aisa lochadar or majboot kaagaj bhi banaaenge jo polibag kii jagah le sake

 The murder was of innocent student Pradyumna, but the case was murdered by the Gurgaon police
 sisitivi main tasviren vahi, chashmadid vahi, mauka-e-vaardaat vahi lekin gudgaanv police ke mutabik kaatil bas conductor ashok niklaa
 Whereas, after examining all these evidences, CBI introduced someone else as a murderer
 ab sawaal uthta he ki gudgaanv police se kahaan galati hui yaa phir sibiai ne aise koun se saboot dhunde jisaki vajah se ek nayaa kaatil saamne aayaa
 CBI changed the theory of the police
 us cese ke saboot vahi
 He is also his witness
 to phir nateeja sire se palat kaise gaya
 In the case of Pradyuman Murder, the police, which was considering open and shut case, suddenly got confused after two months
 to phir aisa kya tha, jo sibiai ko to dikhaa magar gudgaanv police dekh nahin pai
 Or seeing he had ignored it
 ab sibiai kii maane to gudgaanv police kii jaanch main use sisitivi main ek chaatr to dikhaa tha lekin uski sui conductor par tiki thi
 He was just making a mistake here
 sibiai ne sisitivi footage se shuru kii jandalabatta police kii tarah sibiai ne bhi is maamle main tafteesh kii shuruyaat sisitivi footage se hi kii
 In this footage, another boy with innocent Pradyumna was seen walking towards the bathroom
 jabaki pradhyumna kii bahan bathroom ke duusari taraf jaati hui dikh rahi thi
 But this CCTV footage was not clear, it was difficult to identify the face
 aise main sibiai ne forensik exparts kii madad lee
 After examining the footage from the front and back, the experts confirmed that the boy going to and from the bathroom is the same, while the other boy is Pradyuman
 aaropee ne hi ashok ke khilaaf diya tha bayaanuniform se sibiai ko pataa chalaa ki chaatr 11veen class kaa hi he
 After this, all the students studying in class 11th in the school were questioned
 phir pataa chalaa ki isi class kaa ek ladkaa is maamle main chashmadid tha or usne 164 main magistrate ke saamne bas conductor ke khilaaf bayaan bhi diya tha
 The CBI focused all the attention on the accused student and in his conversation, the CBI became suspicious
 kyonki chaatr se kareeb chaar-paanch baar poochtacha kii gai
 But the strange thing was that every time during interrogation, his statement was changing
 aaropee chaatr ne isliye kiya murdyab sawaal motive kaa tha
 Which means boy why Pradyumna Kaktalkiya? According to CBI sources, the accused student is weak in studies and was nervous about the exam and parent teachers meeting that took place in the school that day
 wo inhen postapon karana chahta tha or isiilie usne pradhyumna ko maarane kaa faisla kar liya
 Any other child could also fall prey to Pradyumna that day
 aaropee ne bathroom main dekhi thi porn filmasibiai ke mutabik us rose aaropee ladke ne bathroom jane ke baad apane mobile phone par edlt film dekhi or usne pradhyumna se zyaadati kii koshish kii
 But Pradyumna protested and killed her
 lekin sibiai 11veen ke is chaatr ko tab tak hiraasat main nahin lenaa chaah rahi thi jab tak puri tarah se mutmain na ho jaae
 Changed: The accused student's speech was first talked to his friends at school
 is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kii gai ki kya pradhymn kii hatya ke baad us chaatr ke bartaav main tabdili ai thi
 During interrogation, not only that student's friends but his parents themselves changed the behavior of Tasdeek's student after this
 sibiai kii maane ne ladke ne qatl se pehle apane doston se bhi kaha tha ki wo pariksha kii taiyaari na karen, kyonki skool main chuttee hone vaali he
 Now his family are saying that he has no meaning with the murder of Pradyuman but is trying to trap him
 aaropee chaatr ab remand parahaalanki is maamle kaa doosraa pahalu ye bhi he ki aaropee chaatr ilaake ke rasukhdaar logon main se hai or shaayad uske parijanon ko apane bete ke bartaav se andaaza lag gaya tha ki maamle main kuch gadabad he
 a case of murder of Pradyuman was registered against the accused student under section 302

 Varuthini Ekadashi 2019: Fasting of Varuthini Ekadashi gives blessings to Lord Vishnu
 is vrath ko saubhaahgya pradaan karne vaala vrath bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is believed that by fasting in Varuthini Ekadashi, children have longevity, they do not have any problem
 durghatana se surakshit rahete hai
 Lord Vishnu is worshiped in this
 mana jaataa he ki varuthini ekadshi kaa vrath karne se vishnu bhagwaan prasann hokar khub dhan dete hai
 In Vaishakh month, 2 Ekadashi falls, in which Krishna Paksha Ekadashi is called Varuthini Ekadashi
 aisi bhi manyata he ki varuthini ekadshi par vrath rakhane se is lok ke saath paralok main bhi punya miltaa he
 This time, Varuthini Ekadashi fast is on Tuesday 30 April 2019
 kaise karen varuthini ekadshi kii puja-- isamen vishnu bhagwaan kii vrath-puja kii jaati he
 - Take Gangajal in the morning and take bath and wear white clothes
 - ek kalash kii sthapana karen
 - Put mango pallava, coconut, red chunri on the Kalash
 - dhoop, deepak jalaakar barfi, kharbooza or aam kaa bhoga lagaaein or namo bhagavate vasudevy kaa jaap karen
 - This fast is opened the next day only after reciting the pooja and till then only fruits are served
 varuthini ekadshi kii katha kya he-kaha jaataa he ki varshon pehle narmada nadi ke tat par ek raja rahaa karata tha
 The name of this king was Mandhata
 raja bahut dayaalu, dharmik or daan karne vaala tha or bhagwaan ko bahut maanata tha
 He used to do penance for Lord Vishnu sitting in the forest for hours
 ek din wo tapasya main bahut leen ho gaya, tab ek junglee bhaaluu aa gaya or wo raja ko munh se pakadakar jangal kii ore le jane laga
 But the king did not get angry at all and he did not break his penance either
 balki bhagwaan vishnu se prarthana kii 'he bhagwan mujhe is sankat se bachaao
 'eventually Lord Vishnu appeared there
 iske baad bhagwaan vishnu ne prakat hokar apane chakra se bhaaluu ko maar giraaya
 The bear had injured the king's leg and the king was very sad
 vishnu ji ne raja se kaha tum mathura jaao or waha varuthini ekadshi kaa vrath karo or meri varah avatar murti kii puja karo
 All your limbs and legs will be fixed
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or wo bilkul thik ho gaya
 In this way one who fasts and worships Varuthini Ekadashi
 usko chot nahin lagati or uske saath koi durghatana bhi nahin hoti he

 Sniffer dogs are able to find that there is a person alive under the debris
 koshish hamaari puri rahegi adhiktam logon ko jinda bachaaen
 Relief work is also to be carried out after the rescue operation
 rihabilitation kaa kaam bhi to bahut lambaa chalegaa
 But humanity has its own strengths
 sava-sau karod desh vaasiyon ke liye nepal apana he
 The sorrow of those people is also our sorrow
 bharat puri koshish karegaa is aapadaa ke samay har nepali ke aansu bhi ponchhenge, unka haath bhi pakadenge, unako saath bhi denge
 Recently in Yemen, thousands of our Indian siblings were stranded
 yuddh kii bhayankar vibheeshikaa ke bich, bam bandook ke tanaav ke bich, golabari ke bich bharatiyon ko nikaalnaa, jivit nikaalnaa, ek bahut bada kathin kaam tha
 But we were able to
 itnaa hi nahin, ek saptaah kii umr kii ek bacchee ko jab bachaa karke laaye to aisa lag rahaa tha ki aakhir maanavtaa kii bhi kitni badi takat hoti he
 If the rain of a bomb and the gun goes on, the shadow of death, and a week old child can save his life, then a mind is satisfied
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he
 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, Hi, man kii baat karne kaa man nahin ho rahaa tha aaj
 Feeling burdened, a bit distressed
 pichley maheene jab baat kar rahaa tha aapse, to ole girane kii khabaren, bemausami barsaat, kisaanon kii tabaahi
 Just a few days ago, there was a sudden strong wind in Bihar
 kaaphi log maare gaye
 Much damage was done
 or shanivaar ko bhayankar bukamp ne puure vishwa ko hilaa diya he
 It seems as if the natural disaster has started
 nepal main bhayankar bukamp kii aapadaa
 In India too, earthquake has killed many people in different states
 sampatti kaa bhi nuksaan kiya he
 But Nepal's loss is terrible
 maine 2001, 26 janvari, kuccha ke bukamp ko nikat se dekha he
 i can well imagine how terrible this disaster is
 nepal par kya bitati hogi, un pariwaron par kya bitati hogi, uski main kalpana kar saktaa hum
 But my dear brothers and sisters of Nepal, Hindustan is with you in your grief
 tatkaal madad ke liye chaahe hindustan ke jis kone main musiibat aayi he vahaan bhi, or nepal main bhi sahay pahunchaana prarambh kar diya he
 The first thing is rescue operation, to save people
 abhi bhi malbe main dabe hue kuch log jivit honge, unako jinda nikaalnaa hai
 Experts have sent teams of people, along with sniffer dogs who have been specially trained for this task
 snifer dogs dhund pate hai ki kahin malbe ke neeche koi insaan jinda ho
 It will be our endeavor to save the maximum number of lives
 rescue oparation ke baad relif kaa kaam bhi chalaanaa he
 Rehabilitation work will also go a long way
 lekin maanavtaa kii apni ek takat hoti he
 Nepal is its own for 125 crore people
 un logon kaa dukh bhi hamaara dukh he
 India will try its best to wipe the tears of every Nepali at the time of this disaster, will also hold their hand, will also support them
 pichley dinon yaman main, hamaare hajaaron bhartiya bhai bahan fanse hue the
 In the midst of the terrible horrors of war, amidst the tension of a bomb shotgun, evacuating the Indians, firing them alive, was a very difficult task
 lekin ham kar paae
 Not only this, when it was saved by bringing a girl of one week of age, it seemed that humanity too has great power
 bam-bandook kii varsha chalati ho, maut kaa saaya ho, or ek saptaah kii bacchee apni jindagi bachaa sake tab ek man ko santosh hota he
 Wherever i went abroad in the past, many congratulations were received for one thing, and it was in Yemen that we rescued citizens of about 48 countries of the world
 chaahe america ho, you
 K
 ho, france ho, rashia ho, germany ho, japan ho, har desh ke naagarik ko hamane madad kii thi
 And because of this, this "seva Parmo Dharma" of India in the world has been realized by the world
 hamaara videsh mantralay, hamaari vaayu sena, hamaari nausena itane dhairya ke saath, itani jimmevary ke saath, is kaam ko kiya he, duniya main isaki amit chhap rahegi aane vaale dinon main, aisa main vishwaas karata hum
 And i am glad that everybody came out without any loss
 vaise bhi bharat kaa ek gun, bharat ke sanskaar bahut puraane hai
 Just when i went to France, in France, i went to a World War i memorial
 uskaa ek kaaran bhi tha, ki pratham vishwa yuddh kii shatabdi to he, lekin saath-saath bharat kii parakram kaa bhi wo shatabdi varsh haii bharat ke veeron kii balidani kii shatabdi kaa varsh he or “seva parmo-dharmah” is adarsh ko kaise charitaarth karata rahaa hamaara desh , uski bhi shatabdi kaa yah varsh he, main yah isliye kah rahaa hum ki 1914 main or 1918 tak pratham vishwa yuddh chalaa or bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga kareeb-kareeb 15 lakh bhartiya sainikon ne is yuddh main apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi or bharat ke jawan apane liye nahin mar rahe thei hindustan ko, kisi desh ko kabja nahin karnaa tha, na hindustan ko kisi kii jameen leni thi lekin bharatiyon ne ek adbhut parakram karke dikhaaya thai bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga is pratham vishwa yuddh main hamaare kareeb-kareeb 74 hajaar javaanon ne shahadat kii thi, ye bhi garv kii baat he ki is par kareeb 9 hajaar 2 sau hamaare sainikon ko galentry award se decorat kiya gaya thai itnaa hi nahin, 11 aise parakramee log the jinako sarvshereshth sammaan victoria cross mila thai khaskar ki france main vishwa yuddh ke darmiyaan march 1915 main kareeb 4 hajaar 7 sau hamaare hindustaniyon ne balidaan diya tha
 France has built a memorial in his honor
 main vahaan naman karne gaya tha, hamaare purvajon ke parakram ke prati shradhdha vyakt karne gaya tha
 If we see all these events, then we can say to the world that this country is one which thinks for the peace of the world, for the happiness of the world, for the welfare of the world
 kuch na kuch karata he or zarurat pade to jaan kii baazi bhi laga detaa he
 In the United Nations too, India has also been named in the first line of the contribution of Peacekeeping Force
 yahi to ham logon ke liye garv kii baat he
 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara

 Today, i was not feeling like talking about my mind
 boj anubhav kar rahaa hum, kuch vyathit sa man he
 When i was talking to you last month, there were reports of hailstorms, unseasonal rains, devastation of farmers
 abhi kuch din pehle bihar main achaanak tej hawa chali
 Many people were killed
 kaaphi kuch nuksaan hua
 And the terrible earthquake on Saturday has shaken the whole world
 aisa lagata he maano prakritik aapadaa kaa silsilaa chal padaa he
 Catastrophic earthquake disaster in Nepal
 hindustan main bhi bukamp ne alag-alag rajyon main kai logon kii jaan lee he
 Has also done property damage
 lekin nepal kaa nuksaan bahut bhayankar he
 i have closely observed the 2001, 26 January, Kutch earthquake
 ye aapadaa kitni bhayanak hoti he, uski main kalpana bhalee-bhaanti kar saktaa hum
 i can imagine what would have passed on Nepal, what would have passed on those families
 lekin mere pyaare nepal ke bhaaiyo-bahano, hindustan aapke dukh main aapke saath he
 For immediate help, even in the corner of the country where there is trouble, and in Nepal, we have started to provide help
 sabase pehla kaam he rescue oparation, logon ko bachaana
 Some people still buried under the debris will be alive, they have to be saved
 export logon kii team bheji he, saath main, is kaam ke liye jinako vishesh rup se train kiya gaya he aise snifar dogs ko bhi bheja gaya he
 Sniffer dogs are able to find that there is a person alive under the debris
 koshish hamaari puri rahegi adhiktam logon ko jinda bachaaen
 Relief work is also to be carried out after the rescue operation
 rihabilitation kaa kaam bhi to bahut lambaa chalegaa
 But humanity has its own strengths
 sava-sau karod desh vaasiyon ke liye nepal apana he
 The sorrow of those people is also our sorrow
 bharat puri koshish karegaa is aapadaa ke samay har nepali ke aansu bhi ponchhenge, unka haath bhi pakadenge, unako saath bhi denge
 Recently in Yemen, thousands of our Indian siblings were stranded
 yuddh kii bhayankar vibheeshikaa ke bich, bam bandook ke tanaav ke bich, golabari ke bich bharatiyon ko nikaalnaa, jivit nikaalnaa, ek bahut bada kathin kaam tha
 But we were able to
 itnaa hi nahin, ek saptaah kii umr kii ek bacchee ko jab bachaa karke laaye to aisa lag rahaa tha ki aakhir maanavtaa kii bhi kitni badi takat hoti he
 If the rain of a bomb and the gun goes on, the shadow of death, and a week old child can save his life, then a mind is satisfied
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he
 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 maine 2001, 26 janvari, kuccha ke bukamp ko nikat se dekha he
 i can well imagine how terrible this disaster is
 nepal par kya bitati hogi, un pariwaron par kya bitati hogi, uski main kalpana kar saktaa hum
 But my dear brothers and sisters of Nepal, Hindustan is with you in your grief
 tatkaal madad ke liye chaahe hindustan ke jis kone main musiibat aayi he vahaan bhi, or nepal main bhi sahay pahunchaana prarambh kar diya he
 The first task is rescue operation, to save people
 abhi bhi malbe main dabe hue kuch log jivit honge, unako jinda nikaalnaa hai
 Experts have sent teams of people, along with sniffer dogs who have been specially trained for this task
 snifer dogs dhund pate hai ki kahin malbe ke neeche koi insaan jinda ho
 It will be our endeavor to save the maximum number of lives
 rescue oparation ke baad relif kaa kaam bhi chalaanaa he
 Rehabilitation work will also go a long way
 lekin maanavtaa kii apni ek takat hoti he
 Nepal is its own for 125 crore people
 un logon kaa dukh bhi hamaara dukh he
 India will try its best to wipe the tears of every Nepali at the time of this disaster, will also hold their hand, will also support them
 pichley dinon yaman main, hamaare hajaaron bhartiya bhai bahan fanse hue the
 In the midst of the terrible horrors of war, amidst the tension of a bomb shotgun, evacuating the Indians, firing them alive, was a very difficult task
 lekin ham kar paae
 Not only this, when it was saved by bringing a girl of one week of age, it seemed that humanity too has great power
 bam-bandook kii varsha chalati ho, maut kaa saaya ho, or ek saptaah kii bacchee apni jindagi bachaa sake tab ek man ko santosh hota he
 Wherever i went abroad in the past, many congratulations were received for one thing, and it was in Yemen that we rescued citizens of about 48 countries of the world
 chaahe america ho, you
 K
 ho, france ho, rashia ho, germany ho, japan ho, har desh ke naagarik ko hamane madad kii thi
 And because of this, this "seva Parmo Dharma" of India in the world has been realized by the world
 hamaara videsh mantralay, hamaari vaayu sena, hamaari nausena itane dhairya ke saath, itani jimmevary ke saath, is kaam ko kiya he, duniya main isaki amit chhap rahegi aane vaale dinon main, aisa main vishwaas karata hum
 And i am glad that everybody came out without any loss
 vaise bhi bharat kaa ek gun, bharat ke sanskaar bahut puraane hai
 Just when i went to France, in France, i went to a World War i memorial
 uskaa ek kaaran bhi tha, ki pratham vishwa yuddh kii shatabdi to he, lekin saath-saath bharat kii parakram kaa bhi wo shatabdi varsh haii bharat ke veeron kii balidani kii shatabdi kaa varsh he or “seva parmo-dharmah” is adarsh ko kaise charitaarth karata rahaa hamaara desh , uski bhi shatabdi kaa yah varsh he, main yah isliye kah rahaa hum ki 1914 main or 1918 tak pratham vishwa yuddh chalaa or bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga kareeb-kareeb 15 lakh bhartiya sainikon ne is yuddh main apni jaan kii baaji laga di thi or bharat ke jawan apane liye nahin mar rahe thei hindustan ko, kisi desh ko kabja nahin karnaa tha, na hindustan ko kisi kii jameen leni thi lekin bharatiyon ne ek adbhut parakram karke dikhaaya thai bahut kam logon ko maaloom hoga is pratham vishwa yuddh main hamaare kareeb-kareeb 74 hajaar javaanon ne shahadat kii thi, ye bhi garv kii baat he ki is par kareeb 9 hajaar 2 sau hamaare sainikon ko galentry award se decorat kiya gaya thai itnaa hi nahin, 11 aise parakramee log the jinako sarvshereshth sammaan victoria cross mila thai khaskar ki france main vishwa yuddh ke darmiyaan march 1915 main kareeb 4 hajaar 7 sau hamaare hindustaniyon ne balidaan diya tha
 France has built a memorial in his honor
 main vahaan naman karne gaya tha, hamaare purvajon ke parakram ke prati shradhdha vyakt karne gaya tha
 If we see all these events, then we can say to the world that this country is one which thinks for the peace of the world, for the happiness of the world, for the welfare of the world
 kuch na kuch karata he or zarurat pade to jaan kii baazi bhi laga detaa he
 In the United Nations too, India has also been named in the first line of the contribution of Peacekeeping Force
 yahi to ham logon ke liye garv kii baat he
 Recently, i had the opportunity to do two important things
 ham poojya baba sahib ambedkar kii 125 veen jainti kaa varsh manaa rahe hai
 For many years, there was a dispute of land in Mumbai to build his memorial
 mujhe aaj is baat kaa santosh he ki bharat sarkaar ne wo jameen baba sahib ambedkar ke smarak banane ke liye dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 Similarly, in Delhi, an international center should be established in the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, the whole world should know this Manishi, know his thoughts, know his work
 ye bhi varshon se lataka padaa vishay tha, isko bhi puraa kiya, shilanyas kiya, or 20 saal se jo kaam nahin hua tha wo 20 maheenon main puraa karne kaa sankalp kiya
 And at the same time, a thought has come to my mind and we are engaged, even today there are some families in our country who are forced to carry the dirt on the head
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara

 But humanity has its own strengths
 sava-sau karod desh vaasiyon ke liye nepal apana he
 The sorrow of those people is also our sorrow
 bharat puri koshish karegaa is aapadaa ke samay har nepali ke aansu bhi ponchhenge, unka haath bhi pakadenge, unako saath bhi denge
 Recently in Yemen, thousands of our Indian siblings were stranded
 yuddh kii bhayankar vibheeshikaa ke bich, bam bandook ke tanaav ke bich, golabari ke bich bharatiyon ko nikaalnaa, jivit nikaalnaa, ek bahut bada kathin kaam tha
 But we were able to
 itnaa hi nahin, ek saptaah kii umr kii ek bacchee ko jab bachaa karke laaye to aisa lag rahaa tha ki aakhir maanavtaa kii bhi kitni badi takat hoti he
 If the rain of a bomb and the gun goes on, the shadow of death, and a week old child can save his life, then a mind is satisfied
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge
 Students' examinations have been completed, especially students of 10th and 12th must have made holiday programs, i wish you all the best
 aapkaa vekeshan bahut hi acha rahe, jivan main kuch nayaa seekhney kaa, nayaa jaanane kaa avasar mili, or saal bhar aapane mehnat kii he to kuch pal parivaar ke saath umang or utsaah ke saath beete yahi meri shubhakamana he
 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 main pichley dinon videsh main jahaan bhi gaya, ek baat ke liye bahut badhaaiyaan mili, or wo tha yaman main hamane duniya ke kareeb 48 deshon ke nagarikon ko bachaaya tha
 Whether it is America, u
 ke
 Ho, France Ho, Russia Ho, Germany Ho, Japan Ho, we helped every citizen
 or uske kaaran duniya main bharat kaa ye “seva parmo dharmah”, isaki anubhuti vishwa ne kii he
 Our foreign ministry, our air force, our navy have done this work with so much patience, with so much responsibility, it will have an indelible mark in the world, i believe so in the days to come
 or mujhe khushi he ki koi bhi nuksaan ke bina, sab log bachakar ke baahar aaye
 Anyway, a virtue of India, the rites of India are very old
 abhi main jab france gaya tha to france main, main pratham vishwa yuddh ke ek smarak par gaya tha
 There was a reason for this, that it is the century of World War I, but at the same time it is the centenary year of India's might
 It is the year of the sacrificial death of India's heroes and how "seva paramo-dharma:" to illustrate this ideal
 Our country has been doing this, this year of its century, i am saying that World War i went on in 1914 and till 1918 and very few people will know that about 1
5 million Indian soldiers have fought this war
 They had lost their lives in India and the soldiers of India were not dying for themselves
 Hindustan did not have to occupy any country, nor Hindustan had to take anyone's land but Indians had shown a wonderful valor
 Very few people It will be known that about 74 thousand of our soldiers had martyred in this First World War, it is also a matter of pride that about 9 thousand 2 hundred of our soldiers were honored with Gallantry Award
 Was arranged
 Not only that, unke sammaan main france ne vahaan ek smarak banaaya he
 i went there to bow down, pay tribute to the might of our ancestors
 ye sari ghatnayen ham dekhen to ham duniya ko kah sakate hai ki ye desh aisa he jo duniya kii shanti ke liye, duniya ke sukh ke liye, vishwa ke kalyaan ke liye sochataa he
 He does something and, if needed, also betrays his life
 united neshns main bhi piskiping force main sarvaadhik yogadan dene waalon main bharat kaa bhi naam pratham pankti main he
 This is a matter of pride for us
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
