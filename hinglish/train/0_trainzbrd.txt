 i was shocked when i opened the folder containing his photos
 maine paaya ki mere pati apni eks-garlfriend se abhi bhi baat karte hai or donon ek duusare ko apni photose whatsap ke jariye share karte hai
 When i asked my husband about this, he said that both of them are just friends

 lekin acchhee baat ye he ki aapke pati ne ye baat maani ki ve donon abhi dost hai
 You are upset because of sharing photos and also because they have kept the matter of friendship hidden from you
 iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki aapke pati ko shaayad ye laga ho ki agar ve ye baat aapse share karte to shaayad aapako acha nahin lagata
 And you do not get hurt so they kept this thing hidden from you
 ''aapke man main tarah-tarah ke sawaal uthanaa lajimi he lekin mujhe lagata he ki apane man kaa haal aapako apane pati ke saath share karnaa chahie
 Both of you should sit and talk on this issue

 You should not consider your husband wrong or blame him
 isliye sabase behatar he ki pati ke saath quality time bitaayen or isapar khulkar baat karen dout clear ho jayega
 You can also ask the husband to introduce you to his ex girlfriend

 unhone 114 gend kaa saamana karte hue chah chauke kii madad se 87 ran kii naabad pari kheli
 When Dhoni was asked where he would like to bat, he said, 'I am happy to bat at any number
 ahm cheez yah he ki team ko meri jarurat kahaan he
 Dhoni said that he does not prefer any position in the Indian batting order and is ready to bat at any place as per the need of the team
 dhoni ne kaha ki, ‘main chauthe number par khelun yaa chathe number par, hamen dekhnaa hoga ki team kaa santulan barkaraar rahe
 i am happy to bat at number six in the lower order

 Police have also taken strict action against the protesters trying to stage a sit-in on the railway track, but TRS leader Katie Rama Rao and his daughter Kavita, who were detained yesterday, got bail

 swadeshi halke ladaaku vimaan (LCA) tejas kaa nausena ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya sanskaran desh kaa pehla aisa vimaan ban gaya he, jisane safaltaapurvak 'arest landing' kii
 This is considered to be a huge success in the direction of induction into the Navy
 kai bhoomikaayen nibhaane main sakasham is ladaaku vimaan ne test facility main land karte vakt jatke se rukne ke liye apane fuslej se bandhe hook kii madad se ek taar ko pakadaa
 It is important for any aircraft to be able to stop completely in a very short distance for landing on an aircraft carrier
 goa main samudratat par sthit test facility main shuukravaar ko kiya gaya pareekshan unheen paristhitiyon main kiya gaya, jo kisi vimanavahak pot par rahati hai, or jahaan vimaanon ko utarane ke liye deck par bandhe taar ko pakadana padataa he
 This action is called 'arrest landing'
 ab tak kuch hi ladaaku vimaan 'arest landing' kaa karnama kar pate hai, jinhen america, rus, united kingdom, france or haal hi main china ne viksit kiya he
 The repeated success of this test in a test facility built on a beach in Goa will prove that the LCA-N is the most important design feature - this aircraft can withstand the response of 'arrested Landing' on the deck of any aircraft carrier - Perfect doing work
 jab samudratat par hone vaale ye pareekshan safal ho jaaenge, tabhi LCA-N ke prototip ke vikaas kaarykram kaa netritv kar rahe nausena payalat aglaa kadam uthaa paaenge - yani bharat ke ekmaatr oparational vimanavahak pot INS vikramaditya par vastav main ise land karaayaa jayega
 Important members of the LCA-N development team told NDTV that they had flown to the Goa Test facility 60 times during may-june
 vimaan ko INS vikramaditya ke deck par pahunchane ke liye LCA-N ke ejiniyaron or payalton ko is baat ke prati aashwast hona hoga ki vimaan 7
 a vessel can reach the vessel without being damaged by a 'sink rate' (downward speed) of 5 meters per second (1,500 feet per minute)
 project se jude ejiniyaron tathaa payalton ko bharosa he ki ve landing certification ke lakshya ko hasil kar lenge
 There is a major technical concern associated with this project, which may affect the development program of LCA-N
 INS vikramaditya par vimaan ke land karte hi uski gati gata dene vaala maikenical system, yani arrester gear, us arrester gear se dizine ke lihaaz se kaaphi alag he, jo goa kii test facility main laga hua he
 Key members of the LCA-N project team are hoping that this difference will not affect the project, but they are confident that they will be able to actually land on the ship
 netherlands par bangladesh kii jeet ke baad group 'bi' main tiimon kii sthiti kaa akalan jaruri ho gaya he
 The Netherlands and Ireland are not included in this assessment as they are unlikely to reach the quarter-finals
 baaki bachi jin paanch tiimon main quarter final main pahunchane kii hode he, ve hai- dakshin africa, westeindies, bharat, england or bangladesh
 Only four teams from a group have to reach the final 8, so from group 'B', any team involved in this competition will have to measure the way out
 aise main jabaki bangladesh ne england, ireland or netherlands ko haraakar apane khate main chah ank darj kara liye hai, england kii team paanchaven sthaan par khisak gai he
 First place is India, which has seven points
 duusare sthaan par westeindies (6 ank) or tisare sthaan par dakshin africa (6 ank) hai
 Bangladesh has unexpectedly reached the fourth position
 bangladesh ke is mukaable ke baad group 'bi' main kul paanch match khele jane hai
 There will also be a match between Ireland and the Netherlands on 18 March
 is mukaable ko akalan main shaamil nahin kiya ja rahaa he kyonki isse tiimon kii sthiti par koi fark nahin padegaa
 On 15 March, South Africa will face Ireland in which South Africa's victory can be confirmed
 iske baad uske aath ank ho jaaenge or vah talika main pehle sthaan par pahunch jaaegi
 The match between England and West Indies on 17 March will be very important for both teams as well as India
 is match main england kii haar bharat kaa kaam aasaan karegi jabaki duusari ore is match ko jitkar westeindies antim-8 main pahunch jayega
 For England, it will be a do or die match
 england kii haar kaa matlab hoga, uski swadesh vaapasi
 But if England beat the West Indies in this match, then they will be seven points
 is tarah vah bharat kii barabari par pahunch jayega or agar usne bade antar se jeet hasil kii to uskaa net ran rate bhi bharat se behatar ho jayega
 In such a situation a crisis will arise for India
 iske baad 19 march ko dhaka main bangladesh kii bhidnt dakshin africa se hogi
 In the event of winning it, South Africa will strengthen their position in the table but Bangladesh will reach the final-8 with eight points if they suffer a reversal
 is surat main bharat ke saamne antim-8 main spasht taur par jagah banane ke liye kisi bhi haal main westeindies ko haraana hoga
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said before the Nagpur match that his team had reached the quarter-finals, but then Dhoni could not have imagined that his team would lose to South Africa and Bangladesh beat England in their home
 Will give
 england ke khilaaf bhartiya gendbaajon kaa 338 ranon ke lakshya ko bachaa nahin paanaa team ko kaaphi mahangaa pad rahaa he
 Had India got two points from that match, it would not have to go through this situation today and it would not have to depend on the results of other teams to make it to the quarterfinal

 The heinousness of the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape scandal in Delhi shook the entire nation
 ise dekhte hue centre kii tatkaaleen manmohan singh sarkaar ne mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye samarpit ek vishesh fund kii ghoshnaa kii jiskaa naam 'nirbhaya fund' rakhaa gaya
 Today, when this fund has completed five years after receiving the recommendation of Parliament, then it is necessary for us to know how much benefit the government has been able to provide to the victims through this fund
 kya he nirbhaya fund?desh kii samuhik chetana ko hilaa kar rakh dene vaale nirbhaya cond ke baad mahilaon kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne ke liye ek kosh kii jarurat mahasoos kii gai
 Taking cognizance of this, the then UPA government announced the Nirbhaya Fund in the 2013 budget
 vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne shuruaati taur par 1000 karod kaa aavanton bhi kiya
 One thousand crores more were allocated in 2014-15 and 2016-17
 ye paisa aavantit to ho gaya, lekin sarkaar ise kharch nahin kar pai
 In 2015, the government made the Ministry of Women and Child Development the nodal agency for the Nirbhaya Fund in place of the Home Ministry, due to the Home Ministry spending only one per cent of the funds allocated for this fund
 nirbhaya fund ke tahat puure desh main dushkarm sambandhi shikayaton or muaavje ke nistaaran ke liye 660 ekikrut van stop centre banane the
 Due to which legal and financial help is provided to the victims and their identity is also hidden
 saath hi saarvajanik sthanon or parivahan main sisitivi camere lagane the
 So that the culprit can be identified
 muaavja dene main kitni safal raheen sarkarein?haal hi main supreme court ne nirbhaya fund ke tahat yon hinsa kii shikaar peeditaaon ko die jane vaale muaavje ko lekar chintaa vyakt kii thi
 During the hearing, the National Legal Services Authority (nalsa) said that only 5-10 per cent of the victims of rape in various states are getting compensation under the Nirbhaya Fund
 nalsa ne bataaya ki andhra pradesh main uplabdh aankadon kii maane to pichley saal yon hinsa ke darj 901 maamalon main sirf ek peedita ko muaavja mila
 The authority said the figures show that 3305 firs were registered in Rajasthan in 2017 and 140 victims were compensated under these schemes while 1199 firs were registered in sexual violence charges in Bihar, but only 82 victims were compensated
 nodel athurity ke rup main mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay, mahila utthan va suraksha ke liye kharch kii chhot ke baavjood keval 600 karod kharchane or 2,400 karod bache rahane kaa koi thos jawaab supreme court main nahin de paaya
 Why governments failed? Actually Nirbhaya Fund lacks an integrated system for distribution and management of funds earmarked for compensation of victims
 supreme court kaa kahana he ki chunki is fund se teen mantralay grih mantralay, vitt mantralay or mahila evam vikaas mantralay jude hai
 There is confusion about who to do
 haalanki centre sarkaar is fund main dhan muhaiyaa kara rahi he, lekin rajya sarkaron ko yon hinsa sambandhi muaavja kab or kis charan main dena he ise lekar koi spasht praavdhaan nahin he
 Not all states have similar provisions in this fund
 goa jaise rajya main iske tahat 10 lakh rupee ke muaavje kaa praavdhaan he jabaki bahut se rajyon main 1 lakh kaa praavdhaan he
 Eminent jurist Indira Jai singh says that like Delhi, the legal services authority of the states should be given the right to pay compensation to the victims themselves
 rajya kii police yon hinsa sambandhi praathmiki kii soochna vahaan ke vidhik seva pradhikaran ko de jisase peeditaaon ko muaavja dene kii prakriya tej kii ja sake

 Denying media reports about the criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said his remarks in Goa on Saturday were 'completely misconstrued' and twisted
 Gone
 lekin unhone jo tippanee kii thi usase sanket mil rahaa tha ki vah bina naam liye modi kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 During the 'difficult Dialogue' conference in Dona Paula on Saturday, Sinha said without naming Modi, "people of India will give him dust, you just have to wait for the next elections
" ’’ Sinha on Sunday denied that he had made any reference to Modi
 unhone kaha, ‘yah puri tarah se tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya
 Whoever made this reporting, he completely misunderstood my words
 ’ charchaa ke dauraan sinha se ‘main, mujhe or swayan’ kii aaj kii samskruti ke bare main or aise maamle main baatcheet ke upyog ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 The comments purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main mantri rah chuke sinha ne jawaab diya tha ki sansad or vidhansabhaon ke sadasyon sahit nirvaachit jan pratinidhiyon ko lagaataar janata ke paas waapas janaa hoga, jinhone unhen chunaa he
 Sinha then cited the Emergency of 1975 and said that the country knows what happened to the strongest effort made to suppress the voice of disagreement
 sinha ne kaha ki ham sabhi jaanate hai ki bharat kii janata ne kaise pratikriya vyakt kii thi
 Mistakes can happen here and there, we can be very worried about the current situation because according to us some such things are happening
 unhone kaha tha ki mahaan bhartiya samaaj ise dhyaan main rakhega or bharat main samvaad main yakeen nahin rakhane waalon ko dhul chataa degaa
 You just have to wait for the next elections
 ravivaar ko unhone kaha ki apatkaal ke sadanrbh kaa maujuuda sarkaar se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 But the remarks he made indicated that he was criticizing Modi without naming him
 donna paula main shanivaar ko ‘dificult dialog’ sammelan kii paricharchaa main sinha ne modi kaa naam liye bina kaha tha, ‘‘bharat ke log unhen dhul chataa denge, aapako sirf agle chunaavon kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 '' sinha ne ravivaar ko inkaar kiya ki unhone modi kaa koi sandarbh diya tha
 He said, 'it was completely twisted
 jis kisi ne bhi yah reporting kii usne meri kahi baton ko puri tarah galat rup main samajha
 During the discussion, Sinha was asked about the present-day culture of 'I, me and myself' and the use of dialogue in such a case
 tippaniyan Sinha, who was a minister in the government of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had responded that elected public representatives, including members of Parliament and Legislatures, would have to constantly return to the people who elected them
 sinha ne iske baad 1975 ke apatkaal kaa hawala diya or kaha tha ki desh jaanata he ki asahmati kii aawaaj ko dabaane ke liye kiye gaye sabase majboot prayaas kaa kya hua tha
 Sinha said that we all know how the people of India reacted
 yahaan-vahaan galtiyaan ho sakati hai, ham maujuuda halaat ko lekar bahut chintit ho sakate hai kyonki hamaare mutabik aisi kuch chijen ho rahi hai
 He had said that the great Indian society will take this into consideration and will scatter those who do not believe in dialogue in India
 aapako bas agle chunaavon kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 On Sunday, he said that the context of emergency has nothing to do with the current government

 senior citijan yani vruddh logon ko desh ke sabhi bank jamaa par zyada byaaj dete hai
 For example, on any savings scheme, fixed deposits or period deposits, senior citizens get some more interest from the general public
 bank aisa isliye karte hai kyonki ritairement ke baad mili ekamusth raashi bainkon kii taraf aakarshith ho sake
 This increases the CASA (current and saving account ratio) of banks and this capital is also of a permanent nature as the elderly choose to get fds in banks for regular income
 isamen puunji kaa koi jokhim nahin hota or niyamit aay bhi mil jaati he
 The age of senior citizen in the country is considered to be 60 years
 lekin kuch aisi niyam or sharten bhi hoti hai jab 57 varsh kii aayu main hi vyakti ko senior citigen vaale phaayde milane lagate hai
 When does this happen? If a person retires from his job at the age of 57 or 59, then he is entitled to a Senior Citizen Benefit Benefit from the bank
 iske liye use company se ritairement kaa certificate laana anivaary hota he
 Also, within one month of retirement, the bank has to make it aware that it has retired from its company or institution
 yadi company main ritairement kii aayu 57 yaa 59 varsh he to 60 saal se pehle hi us vyakti ko senior citijan vaale laabh milenge
 When will not get profit? Banking experts say that this benefit is not available to the account holder in the case of VRS
 kyonki yahaan company ne use sevanivruth nahin kiya he balki usne swechha se naukari chhodane kaa nirnay liya he
 In such a case, he is not entitled to the benefits of senior citizens
 udhaaharan ke liye beasenel or emtnael kii ore se jari kii gai aakarshak biares skim ke baad company main kareeb 66 hajaar logon ne ritairement le liya
 But these people will not be entitled to get Senior Citizen Benefit from the bank, whereas in a private company or a government institution in which the retirement age is fixed at 57 years, these benefits will be applicable
 to aap bhi agar in niyam or sharton ko puraa karte hai or aapke bank main yah khaas suvidha uplabdh he to 60 saal ke hone se pehle hi senior citijan vaale laabh paa sakate hai

 Ranveer Singh gave the answer of the letter of Janswara, in his cool style, Ranveer has said that i do not know anything else, but Swara has greatly appreciated my performance in the film by messaging me
 isliye vah is baat se khush hai or santusht hai
 Give Swarabata hesitated on repeating the word
 When Swara was asked in a recent interview, you thought that there would be so much ruckus on it, he said that i had no idea about this
 mujhe nahin pataa tha jo log filmon se connected nahin hai wo bhi apni raay dene or meri baat par apni naaraazgi jaahir karenge
 When he was questioned on the language and the word used in the open letter, he replied, i did not know that the word i wrote in the letter starts with 'V' in English and 'Y' in Hindi
 us par itnaa logon ko bura lag jayega
 Swara, who used bold words in the open letter, felt very hesitant to speak those same words at the event
 unhone yahan tak kaha, 'main yahaan us shabd kaa naam nahin le sakati kyonki kai family channel bhi yahaan event main maujuud hai

 It was only after this statement that Pawar's arch-rival and Jagmohan Dalmiya of the Bengal Cricket Association, who had been knocked out by him, also said that things are changing

 Therefore, we have directed the Food Commissioners of all the states to start a campaign in this regard

 isse party ke anya kaaryakartaaon kaa bhi manobal badhegaa
 The BJP wants to send a message to West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC Supremo Mamata Banerjee
 rajya main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 This time the BJP aims to hoist saffron in Bengal
 loksabhaa chunaav main aitihaasik pradarshan ke baad party ke hausale buland hai
 Let me tell you that earlier Mamta Banerjee accepted the invitation of PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony
 lekin jab unhen maaloom chalaa ki 50 bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke pariwaron ko bhi nimantran diya gaya he to unhone inkaar kar diya
 They have decided to sit on the dharna

 He also has a record of this

 dusu chunaav ke liye mukhya chunaav adhikari di es ravat ne kaha, ‘chunaav ladane ke liye daakhile ke samay uniwarsity main darj karaae gaye naamon par hi vichaar kiya jayega

 But last year the All India Students Association (AISA) challenged this prevalent practice in the Delhi High Court
 isa ne kaha tha ki aisa mana jaataa he ki aise matadaata jo kisi khaas ummidavaar ke prati patibaddh nahin hai or tab bhi apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal karte hai, ve duusare naamon par dhyaan die bina us ummidavaar ke paksh main matdaan kar dete hai jiskaa naam mataptr main pehle aata he
 The current president of DUSU, Mohit Nagar, gave his name 'AAA Mohit Nagar' in the nomination as ABVP candidate last year, while NSUI candidate Gaurav Tushir gave his name 'AA Gaurav Tushir'
 iske baad donon ko kramash: ballat number ek or do aavantit kiya gaya
 The Delhi High Court said in November last year that it is faulty to add the letter 'A' before its name to top the ballot of candidates before the DUSU election

 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly campaigning and trying to return to power again, the MP of his party says that the party will not get a majority in the elections this time and BJP will be reduced from 220 to 230 seats and It will have to struggle to win a majority
 saath hi unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki pulavama hamale ke baad modi sarkaar ne agar balakot main air strike nahin kiya hota to party 160 siton par simat jaati
 Subramanian Swamy said in an interview that if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shrinks from 220 to 230 seats, then Narendra Modi may not become Prime Minister again
 unhone kaha ki maan lijie bijepi 220 yaa 230 siton par simat jaati he or endie ke sahyogiyon ko 30 siten milteen he to aankada 250 tak jayega, bijepi ko phir bhi 30 siton kii jarurat hogi
 On the question of Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister again, Subramanian Swamy believes that it depends on other allies
 bahumat ke liye 30 se 40 atirikt siton kii zarurat padegi
 Parties like Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) can support to form government
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki naveen patnayak pehle hi kah chuke hai ki vah (narendra modi) duusare kaarykaal ke liye yogya nahin hai

 saath hi mayawati ke endie main shaamil hone ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki mayawati endie main shaamil ho sakati he or agar wo netritv main badlaav chaahati hai to is par unhen koi aapatti nahin hogi
 Relief to BJP from Balakot strike: On another question, Subramanian Swamy believes that if the government had benefited from the air strike in Balakot after the Pulwama attack and had not done so, the BJP would have suffered a lot
 unhone kaha ki pulavama hamale ke baad agar modi sarkaar ne balakot main air strike nahin kiya hota to bijepi mahaj 160 siton tak simat jaati

 world cap kaa mausam he, lekin maujuuda toornament main cricket ke badale mahendra singh dhoni ke wicketcaping gloves zyada surkhiyaan bator rahe hai
 The mark of 'sacrifice badge' on Dhoni's gloves gave a new twist to the World Cup tournament, which has led to controversy
 ek taraf dhoni hai ki vah apane gloves badalane ko taiyaar nahin hai, jabaki isisi (ICC) apane rukh se palatnaa nahin chaah rahi he
 In such a situation, the 'dhoni-icc' episode has become the biggest issue of the current World Cup
 buudhvaar ko southempton main dakshin africa ke khilaaf bharat ke pehle match ke dauraan dhoni ko balidaan baij ke saath wicketcaping karte dekha gaya tha
 The ICC had asked Dhoni to remove the mark from his glove
 lekin dhoni ne apane gloves se is nishaan ko hataane se manaa kar diya
 BCCI has come out in support of Mahi
 bisisiai ke COA chif vinod raay ne kaha, 'ham isisi ko emes dhoni ko unke dastaane par 'balidaan baij' pahanane ke liye anumati lene ke liye pehle hi chitthee likh chuke hai
 'has Dhoni missed the gloves? Know what the icc's rule says, ICC will not change even now
 ICC sources said that as per the rules there is no scope of appeal, but the BCCI has the authority to write a letter to the ICC
 is maamle ko takneekee samiti ko saunpa jayega
 Which includes Jeff Elders, David Richardson, Kumar Sangakkara, Harsha Bhogle and Steve Elwardi, but it is very unlikely that they will change their stance
 dhoni ke samarthan main purv sainya adhikari, yaad dilaai PAK team kii harkatvarisht isisi sutron kaa kahana he ki sanstha kisi bhi tarah se is par punarvichaar karne vaala nahin he, kyonki koi anya team bhi aisa kuch kah sakati he or ICC ko ise anumati deni hogi
 After this, religious or political message will be sent to the playground, which the ICC can never allow
 to yah lagbhag tay he ki isisi is par apana rukh nahin badalegi
 However, he also clarified that the BCCI has not yet made any formal appeal on it
 indian army ne ye kaha -duusari taraf indian army dhoni ke gloves par lage is nishaan ko balidaan baij nahin maanati
 According to sources in the Indian Army, it is a symbol of Special Forces which is maroon in color and is written in Hindi
 yah hameshaa chaati par pahana jaataa he
 The mark on Dhoni's gloves is a symbol of Para Special Forces
 gloves par much gaya tufaan, dekhen- sena ko dhoni dete hai kitna sammanbisisiai ke baad khel mantralay ne bhi dhoni kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Sports Minister Kiran Rijiju said, 'government does not interfere in the affairs of sports bodies, they are autonomous
 lekin jab mudda desh kii bhaawanaaon se judaa hota he, to raashtra ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 i would like to request the BCCI to take up this matter in the ICC
 'dhoni ne kyon lagaaya balidaan baijabhartiya team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ko cricket main unki uplabdhiyon ke kaaran 2011 main pradeshik sena main maanad leftinent karnal kii rank di gai thi
 Dhoni is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honor
 dhoni ko maanad kamishan diya gaya kyonki vah ek yuva iken hai or vah yuvaaon ko sashastr balon main shaamil hone ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 Dhoni is a trained paratrooper
 unhone para basic course kiya he or paratrupar wings pahante hai
 'pakistan team's prayers on the field, then what is the problem with Dhoni's gloves?' Mahendra Singh Dhoni has proved his rank as honorary lieutenant colonel in the 106 Parachute Regiment of Territorial Army (TA)
 dhoni agast 2015 main prashikshit paratrupar ban gaye the
 After completing his fifth jump from AN-32 aircraft of the Indian Air Force at the Paratroopers Training School (PTS), Agra, he qualified to install the iconic Para Wings insignia
 yani isi ke saath dhoni ko is baij ke istemaal kii yogyata hasil ho gai
 Significantly, then Dhoni jumped from a height of 1,250 feet and successfully landed near the Malpura dropping zone in less than a minute
 november 2011 main dhoni ko pradeshik sena (TA) main leftinent karnal ke maanad rank se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 He had then said that he wanted to become an officer in the army, but luck turned him into a cricketer

 Input: IANS congress party ne loksabhaa chunaav ke baad centre main sarkaar banane par desh ke 20 fisadi garib logon ko nunatam aay dene kaa elaan kiya he
 The scheme has been named 'nyaya'
 somvaar ko is skim kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad se hi puri party jamkar iskaa prachaar-prasar kar rahi he
 In this episode, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also given her opinion
 unhone is skim ko garibi par sabase bada waar bataate hue is baat par sabase zyada khushi jataai he ki is skim kaa laabh sidhe mahilaon ko diya jayega
 In this way, Priyanka Gandhi has once again included women voters in her agenda
 darasal nyaay yojana kii rakam parivaar kii mukhiya mahila ke khate main daali jaaegi
 Prior to this, Priyanka Gandhi has raised the issues related to women prominently even while besieging UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 priyanka ne haal hi main anganbari kaaryakarta, sahayikaayen, ashakarmi or shikshamitron kii samasya uthaate hue upi sarkaar se sawaal kiye hai
 In a tweet, he wrote that the UP Anganwadi workers and assistants are demanding the status of the state employee, but the BJP government is getting sticks on them instead of hearing their pain
 iske alaava priyanka gandhi ne upi kii ashakarmiyon kii maang uthaate hue bhi upi kii bijepi sarkaar ko gherne kaa kaam kiya
 He wrote that the Ashakaris take care of the health of a pregnant woman for 9 months, for which they get only Rs 600, but the BJP government never corrected the increase in their honorarium

 Priyanka Gandhi while sharing her photo with Anganwadi and Hope workers has also said that the struggle of my sisters is my struggle
 yani priyanka gandhi ne sandesh saaf kar diya he
 Now that the Congress has announced its biggest election promise, women have been given preference in that too

 This decision of Congress is also being considered as a strategy to target women voters from electoral point of view
 apni party ke isi faisle par priyanka gandhi ne vishesh taur par khushi jaahir karte hue ab kaha he ki sabase badi khushi to mujhe is baat kii ho rahi he ki 'nyaay' yojana ke jariye 72000 rupee salanaa 5 karodagharon main mahilaon ke khaaton main bheje jaaenge

 satr nyaayalay ne pune ke ghodon ke farm ke maalik hasan ali khan or uske saathi kashinath tapuria kii jamaanat yachika ko shuukravaar ko khaarij kar diya
 The Enforcement Directorate arrested both in March and said that they were depositing $ 9
3 million in foreign banks and that they had conspired to wage war against the nation

 Opposing the bail, the lawyer of the Enforcement Directorate, Ujjwal Nikam, alleged that Hasan and Tapuria had deposited Rs
93 million in foreign banks
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki khan ko hathiyaaron kii bikri se 30 karod rupaye mili hai
 Nikam said that this was evident from the documents which were recovered from him during the investigation and he has his signature and has been verified in London
 nikam ne tark diya ki aropiyon ne antarrashtriya hathiyaar taskar adnan khashogi ke saath hathiyaaron kii taskari kii sajeesh rachi
 From this it can be logically concluded that they conspired to wage war against the nation which is a serious offense in the Indian Penal Code

 Hassan and Tapuria's lawyers IB Bagaria and Girish Kulkarni argued that the alleged offenses committed by the accused belonged to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002

 piem modi desh se baahar the, kejariwal dilli se, rahul pahunch se or congress ke kriyalap meri samaj se
 Through the Delhi Police, the Congress is accusing the Center of getting Rahul Gandhi's scam
 hua ye kidilli police kaa ek eesai rahul gandhi ke ghar pahunchakar unase judijankariyaan juta rahaa tha
 The Congress went through this exasperation and gave it the name of political espionage
 is hangaame main congress ke netaaon kaarukh dekh mujhe apni wo juniurs yaad aate hai jinase ek tuccha sa intro bhile lo to use raging samaj rone lag jate the
 Why is there so much anger over Rahul Gandhi's inquiries, but it is being speculated that the representatives of Delhi Police may have asked that what does Rahul do today? The political meaning of the Congress response is also being explored
 jaanane vaale isecongress kaa hatkandaa bataate hai
 Showing fear of espionage, the Congress wants to say that Rahul is doing something that can be spied on
 iserahul gandhi kii chhavi sudhaarney ke prayaas ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The Congress may associate it with the spying of Rahul Gandhi, but he himself does not know that even before this, there has been an attempt to spy Rahul Gandhi
 ye vovakt tha jab desh main loksabhaa chunaav hone ko the
 There would have been a real war in the war rooms of political parties, meetings-conspiracies, reconciliation-discord were in full swing
 soshalmedia par din bhar dhamachaukadi chalati or tivi dibates par pravaktaa sing ragad karpahunchaa karte
 In those days, a major political party attempted to persuade Rahul Gandhi
 is dussahas kaa makasad ye pataa karnaa tha ki rahulgandhi loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari main kya-kya kar rahe hai? kisase mil rahehain? unki dincharya se lekar unke vyavhaar par najar rakhane ke liye peshevarajasoos rakhe gaye the
 The espionage attempt was unsuccessful when, on the third day, the spies withdrew from their work, believing what the spies said to be true, they had to wait half a day for Rahul to wake up

 isamen dikhaaya gaya ki kaise dilli ke pulicekarmi rishwat ke paise se jeben bhar rahe hai
 The effect of this sting was that within three hours of the news running, 7 policemen were suspended and the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI
 jin saat pulicekarmiyon ko suspend kiya gaya he unke naam is prakaar hai:madanpal bhaati inspector- govindpuri thanenil kumaar sab inspector- kalyanpuri thanadigambar singh head consteble- sangam vihaar thanaar es naruka inspector- pul prahaladapur thanasohanveer head consteble- bhalswa dairy thanadharmaveer consteble- jaitpur thanagirraj meena head consteble- trephic police
 READ- EXCLUSIVE: Click here to watch the Operation Delhi Police video
 Today, 'operation Delhi Police' started from eight o'clock
 isamen dilli police ke ghoosekhor karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ko ek-ek karke benakaab karnaa shuru kiya gaya
 The Kejriwal government of Delhi took immediate cognizance of the case and directed the anti-corruption Branch to investigate and said that an FIR would be lodged on the bribes on Wednesday morning
 arvind kejariwal ne is sting ke liye aaj tak kaa dhanyavad karte hue kaha ki kisi bhi ghoosekhor ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 Many big leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party tweeted and targeted the Delhi Police
 oparation abhi tivi par dikhaaya hi ja rahaa tha ki dilli police ke pravaktaa rajan bhagat phone line par aae
 Rajan Bhagat also thanked Aaj Tak for this sting and said that a case of corruption will be registered against all bribes by suspending them
 rajan bhagat ne logon se apil kii ki is tarah ke ghoosekhor logon ko saamne laaen or dilli police ko saaf banane main madad karen
 Till date, the revelations about the tainted uniforms continued
 abhi raat ke 11 nahin baje the ki dilli police ke pravaktaa ek baar phir phone-line se jude
 He said that the case has been handed over to the CBI
 rajan bhagat ne bataaya ki dilli police ne sting dekhte hi ghoosekhoron ko suspend karke maamla darj kar liya tha
 After this, a CBI inquiry was recommended by the Home Ministry to conduct a 'free and fair' investigation of the case
 grahamantralay ne raat ko hi turant dilli sarkaar kii maang sweekaar kar lee
 This has never happened before, this is the first case in which the police has shown such speed
 aaj tak kabhi aisa nahin hua ki teen ghanton se bhi kam samay main maamla darj karke uski sibiai jaanch kii maang kii gai ho or na hi kabhi aisa hua ki police kii maang par grahamantralay ne turant sibiai jaanch karaane ko hami bhar di ho
 It did this to overlap the Delhi government? Since Arvind Kejriwal had already instructed Delhi's anti-corruption Unit to investigate the matter, then it is also being said that in order to avoid this investigation, it is not easy The case was handed over to the CBI
 dilli sarkaar ke mantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki unhen andeshaa he ki centre sarkaar ne is maamle ko sibiai ko isliye hi saunpa he, taaki ye dilli sarkaar kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar ho jaae
 Manish also targeted the CBI, saying that he expected the CBI to work contrary to the image he is famous for
 isi maamle main itani teji kyon dikhaai?manish sisodiya ne sawaal kiya ki dilli police ne isi maamle main itani teji dikhaai he, jo ki sahi bhi he
 But what about the rest of the cases? Sisodia asked - Ugandan women had complained about sex racket, why it was not acted upon? a boy from Arunachal Pradesh was killed, in this too the police are being questioned? Earlier when Law Minister Somnath Bharti demanded action against the sex racket, so why did the police not show speed?

 ab baba par lage tamaam iljaam agar adaalat main sach sabit ho gaye to samaj lijie ki baba kii baaki kii jindagi jail main hi kategi
 The legal clauses that the Jodhpur Police has imposed on Asaram are enough to keep Baba in jail for the rest of his life
 ve dharaaen hai
 Section 120, Section 342, Section, 354, Section 375, Section 506, Section, 509, Section-5 of POSCO Act
 ye sabhi dharaaen sirf ek cese yani shahjahanpur kii naaballig ladki se dushkarm ke iljaam main lagaai gai hai
 Preparations are on to account all the sins of Baba Asaram
 agar ye sabhi aarope sabit ho gaye to baba lambey nap jaaenge
 The Jodhpur police is also preparing that wherever there are cases against Asaram, everyone should be run together and punish Asaram simultaneously
 asaram ke khilaaf chargeshit to pehle hi pesh kar di jaati, lekin kuch vajahon se ise taal diya gaya
 Now on November 6, a chargesheet will be presented against Baba in the Jodhpur court
 asaram ne dharm kii aad main adharm kii dukaan khol rakhi thi
 He used to show Ram Leela, Krishna Leela to the devotees, but according to the charge sheet, he was busy in sin behind the scenes
 asaram ke in kukarmon kii vajah se sanathan dharm badnaam hua
 In such a situation, every section feels that strict punishment is necessary for such hypocrites
 asaram par pehali baar iljaam to ek naaballig ladki ke saath yon shoshan kaa hi laga tha, lekin tafteesh jaise-jaise aage badhati gai, asaram kii asaliyat bhi saamne aati rahi
 The charge sheet, which is going to be filed on November 6, has charges of sexual exploitation, molestation, running sex racket and even the sale and sale of girls on Asaram
 jodhpur police ne yon shoshan ke iljaam main giraftaar asaram ke khilaaf ilzaamon kii jo fehrist taiyaar kii he, wo agar insaaf kii kasuti par sahi pai gai, to asaram kaa hashr aap soch sakate hai
 Because it is not only the charge of sexual exploitation of a minor girl against Asaram, but the police have also accused Asaram of committing prostitution and selling of girls
 or rape se lekar posko act kii dhaaraon ke tahat darj is maamle main ek nahin kai gunahon main umr kaid kii sajaa ho sakati he
 According to the lawsuit filed against Asaram under Section 376 of the police, if Asaram is found guilty of sexual exploitation, he can be punished with imprisonment ranging from seven years to life
 lekin police ke mutabik asaram ke gunahon kii pherarist kahin or bhi lambii he
 Police has also imposed Section 370 of the IPC against Asaram
 jiskaa matlab insaanon kii kharid-farokht karnaa he
 In statements given under CRPC 161, Asaram's henchmen and their old servicemen have already revealed many more acts of Asaram
 or unheen khulaason main asaram par ladakiyon kaa yon shoshan karne ke saath-saath unhen kabje main rakhane or unhen aage kharidne or bechney ke bhi iljaam lage hai
 While imprisonment up to seven years was possible under 370, but now it can be imprisoned for life if found guilty after a change in the case of child trafficking
 asaram ke khilaaf taiyaar police kii chargeshit main ipisi kii dhara 354 shaamil he
 According to the police, Asaram also beaten up the victim girl for molesting her
 or iske tahat asaram 354 ke bhi mulzim hai
 In this, he is punishable with imprisonment of up to 2 years and fine if proven guilty
 jabaki asaram par ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath aksar ashleel or bhaddi baaten karne kii vajah se ipisi kii dhara or 509 kii upadhara 34 bhi lagaai gai he
 Asaram is also accused of conspiring under section 120 of the IPC, forcibly taking a minor girl in his cottage under 342, threatening to kill the victim and her family under 506
 lekin yon shoshan ke saath-saath sabase sangeen iljaam ipisi kii dhara 375 ke tahat rape or posko kii dhara 5 or 6 ke tahat he
 According to this, the police are telling Asaram to commit life with the girl
 ye jurm sabit hone par bhi asaram ko umr kaid kii sajaa ho sakati he
 The Jodhpur police has made full preparations to get Asaram sentenced for each of his crimes separately
 asaram ke khilaaf taiyaar chargeshit main police ne kareeb das dhaaraon kaa zikr kiya he
 Some of these streams are so serious that if proven, there is no scope of release from the jail
 jab asaram ke sitare bulandi par the, to duniya unke kadamon main bichhi rahati thi
 Now Asaram's stars are in greed, so there is no prize
 dharm kii aad main adharm kaa kaala kaarobaar karne vaale asaram kii story kaa clymex lagaataar najadik aa rahaa he, kyonki ab baari he chargeshit daakhil karne kii

 At the same time, Gavaskar said that Dhoni has been an exceptional player for India and he will be better in the next three to five years
 gavaskar ne yah bhi kaha ki dakshin africa ke khilaaf tii-20 siries or vanade siries main bharat kii naakaami ke liye dhoni ko bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he
 Dhoni has been the target of critics after the team's defeat in the T20 series and first ODI against South Africa, but Gavaskar believes that Dhoni alone is not the only player who failed to deliver results for the team
 unhone kaha, har koi bharat kii haar ke liye dhoni ko bali kaa bakra banane par tula he, lekin wo is baat ko kyon nazarandaaj kar rahe hai ki shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli, suresh raina ne zyada ran nahin banaae
 So why is Dhoni, who played so well for years, being held responsible for India's defeat? dakshin africa ke khilaaf tii-20 siries or pehle vanade main team kii haar ke baad dhoni aalochakon ke nishane par hai, lekin gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki akele dhoni hi aise khilaadi nahin hai, jo team ke liye nattejey dene main naakaam rahe
 He said, "everyone is bent on making Dhoni a scapegoat for India's defeat, but why are they ignoring that Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina did not score much runs
" aise main dhoni, jinhone saalon tak itnaa acha khelaa, unhen bharat kii haar ke liye jimmedaar kyon tehraaya ja rahaa he? On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, RJD chief Lalu Yadav arranged a special banquet at his house

 Air India incurred a huge loss of Rs 8,400 crore in FY 2018-19
 air india pehle se hi lambey samay se paison kii kami se jujh rahi he or karj ke boj se dabi hui he
 The company has incurred huge losses due to higher operating costs and foreign exchange losses
 air india ko ek saal main jitna ghaataa hua he utane main to ek nai airlines shuru kii ja sakati he
 It is worth noting that the market capitalization of spicejet, the airline running successfully in the country, is only Rs 7,892 crore, ie this airline can be bought in less than Rs 8,000 crore capital
 vitt varsh 2018-19 main air india kii kul aay 26,400 karod rupee rahi
 The company has incurred an operating loss of Rs 4,600 crore during this period

 pakistani airspes band hone se 491 karod kaa nuksansarkari aankadon ke mutabik 2 july tak air india ko pakistani airspes band hone se 491 karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho chukaa he
 Significantly, Pakistan first closed its airspace after the Balakot strike in February, it was opened in July

 Meanwhile, private airlines spicejet, indigo and goair, respectively, 30

 Despite this, the officials expect that the debt-ridden Air India will come back to profit by the end of this financial year ie 2019-20
 unka kahana he ki yadi eendhan kii keemten ab or na badhen or videshi mudra main zyada utaar-chadhaav na aae to air india ko is saal 700 se 800 karod rupee kaa oparating profit ho saktaa he

 Sheila Dixit, who has been ruling in Delhi for 10 years, has not been declared a future Chief Minister by the Congress this time too
 is baar mahangaai or aatankwaad ke masale par shila sarkaar buree tarah ghirti najar aa rahi he
 Here are the highlights of the conversation with Sheila Dixit
 das saal sarkaar chalaane ke baad aap kin muddon par chunaav main ja rahi hai?vishwaas se, aatmavishvaas se ja rahe hai
 We are not apologetic
 har kshetra main kaam kiya he, shiksha ho, buniyadi dhaancha ho, mahilaon ke adhikaar hon, saamaajik nyaay ho
 Today, Delhi is considered the most prosperous city in the country
 abhi vaataavaran centre ke khilaaf dikh rahaa he
 You will not be harmed? In today's weekly program 'sidhi Baat', Delhi's current Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and bjp's declared Chief Ministerial candidate Vijay Malhotra spoke to India Today Editor Prabhu Chawla
 dekhie, dilli hi nahin, desh ke log maanate hai ki jab rajya main chunaav hote hai to sthaneey sarkaar ko parkhaa jaataa he
 People know this difference, and the people of Delhi especially
 (centre or rajya ke) mudde ekadam alag hai
 The government of Delhi is an everyday government
 varsh 1998 main mahangaai bada mudda thi, bhaajapa kii sarkaar gai
 Today again inflation is the issue, you will not be hurt? At that time there was inflation
 pyaaj hi nahin, namak bhi mahangaa ho gaya tha
 But we have dealt with wherever the prices have increased
 ab saamaanya keemat vruddhi bhi duusare shaharon se kam he
 The BJP is alleging that buses which cost Rs 16 lakh in Chennai
 main kharidi gayi, aapaki sarkaar ne 43 lakh ru
 He bought? 16 lakhs
 main kharidi hai? kahaan kharidi hai? mujhe bataa den
 The same low-floor buses, CNG ones, cost Rs 16 lakh from the same company
 main mil rahi hon to hamen bataaen kahaan mil rahi hai?aatankwaad or kanoon-vyavastha kaa maamla chintajanak he
 i can say this much and people also know that i do not have law and order i
e
 police
 jab-jab koi prakaran hua, tab-tab jaakar centre sarkaar ko yaa up-rajyapal ko bataaya he
 Terrorism is the problem of the whole country
 haa dilli bada torget he kyonki dilli rajdhani he desh kii
 Not mine, it is the capital of the whole country
 jin rajyon ke adheen police he, ve to sambhaal nahin paa rahe hai, or mujhe kaha jaataa he
 But the central government is doing it, as it is
 jab aatankwaad kii baat aati he to sawaal uthta he ki afjal guru kii dayaa yachika ko kyon taala ja rahaa he?nahin, meraa khyaal he ki isko taalane kii baat nahin he
 We have this file
 lekin main iske bare main charchaa nahin karnaa chaahati hum
 Now the Congress has not declared you its future Chief Minister, if it had done so, it would not have gained much confidence in the electoral battle? 1998 main main nahin ghoshit kii gai thi, chunaav mere netritv main lade gaye the
 i was not declared even in 2003, but elections were fought under my leadership
 aaj bhi vahi sthiti he, main mukhyamantri hum, pradesh congress adhyaksh hai, ham donon netritv karenge
 The claims of regularizing irregular colonies have been termed by the BJP as fraud
 ye chhalaava hi hota to ham itnaa vakt nahin lagaate
 The matter has been stuck for many years
 yah adaalat main lataka tha, niyojan main atka tha or shahari vikaas mantralay main atka hua tha
 We started when the Ministry issued the notification and the court gave its approval
 maine aisa koi kaam nahin kiya jisaki buniyaad gaiyr-kanoonee ho
 What is the big task that we want to do after becoming the Chief Minister for the third time? Cleanliness of Yamuna is a big challenge which we could not do properly aane vaale tinek saal main puraa kar lenge
 Delhi's growing population is the problem
 badhati aabaadi main bangladeshi bhi hai
 Are there any plans to remove them? There is no such plan
 ham kisi ko nahin hataate
 People come from everywhere
 desh ke kone-kone se aate hai
 We come from outside, what is the problem of border or what, we do not know, it is a challenge for the country
 lekin ham kisi ko nahin hataa sakate
 Former MP Prakash Ambedkar was stopped by the police from going to Kopardi village in Ahmednagar on Thursday
 bharipa bahujan mahasang ke rashtri netaa prakaash ambedkar balaatkaar or hatya kii shikaar 15 saal kii naaballik ladki ke parivaar se milane ja rahe the
 Why Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Ambedkar, left from Pune to visit Kopardi village in Ahmednagar on Thursday to meet the victim's family
 ve aadha rasta safar kar chuke the tab unka phone baja, unke ahmednagar ke kaaryakarta ne phone par bataaya ke ahmednagar ke police adhikshak saurabh treepathi ne dhara 149 ko notice diya he
 Prakash Ambedkar's visit to Kopardi village can create an atmosphere of tension and hence he is being prevented from going there
 prakaash ambedkar ne turant ahmednagar ke police adhikshak se mobile se sampark kiya or is baat kii pushti karne ke baad , unako shirur gaanv se pune lautnaa padaa
 He told the Journalist Council in Pune that he was informed by the Ahmednagar Police Superintendent that some Samaj Kanthak in the village is planning to throw onions, eggs and tomatoes on Prakash Ambedkar
 or wo ye isliye karnaa chaahate he taaki gaanv main tanaav bade, hinsa bhi ho
 Prakash Ambedkar said that if a big leader had removed the letter and prevented me from going there, i could understand it
 lekin us gaanv kaa ek vyakti jis par kai sangeen aarope he usne gaanv main meeting lekar bataaya ki mujhe aalu maarenge, tamaato, andey maarenge, to mujhe aise lagata he ki us shaks kaa makasad he ki chashmadidon ko daraaya jaae
 Sharad Pawar needs to intervene
 Prakash Ambedkar requested NCP leader Sharad Pawar to intervene in this matter and prevent local leaders from doing politics in this delicate matter
 bharipa bahujan mahasang ke is rashtri netaa ne aarope lagaaya ke raajnneetik partiyon ke netaaon ke vichaardhaara kaa str gir chukaa he, wo kisi bhi baat ko gambhirtha se nahin lete hai
 In the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the allegations and counter-allegations of the ruling and opposition started in this case were irresponsible
 prakaash ambedkar ke mutabik kochardy gaanv ke hi kuch vyakti, nahin chaahate ki chashmadid saamne aakar police ko isamen maamle kii gavaahi de , madad kare
 That is why this conspiracy was hatched that when Prakash Ambedkar came to Kopardi village, shouting slogans against him, prevent him from coming to the village
 prakaash ambedkar ke mutabik philhal wo kochardy bhale hi naa jaae lekin wo gaanv kaa maahaul shant hone ke baad main vahaan peedit parivaar se milane jarur jaaenge
