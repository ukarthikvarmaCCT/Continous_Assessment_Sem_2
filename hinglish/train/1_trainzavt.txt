 don't drink it!!!— Karan Johar (@karanjohar)february 3, 2015 On the plea of sanjay Chandra, MD of Uninor in the 2G spectrum allocation scam, the Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the CBI and asked to file a reply by 13 March
 chandra ne nichali adaalat dwaara unke khilaaf tay aaropon ko radd karne kii maang kii thi
 a bench of Justice ML Mehta ordered the CBI to issue notice
 chandra ne vishesh sibiai nyaayadhish ke 22 aktubar, 2011 ke aadesh ke khilaaf ucch nyaayalay main guhaar lagaai thi
 He said that this decision has been taken with 'carelessness and inadvertence'
 unhone kaha tha ki ‘bina nyaayik soch ke’ faisla sunaaya gaya he kyonki is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki unhone galat aarthik phaayde ke liye kisi sarkari adhikari ke saath sajeesh rachi thi
 Chandra had argued, "there is no evidence that the petitioner (chandra) has committed any wrongdoing to the Government of India in any manner for the sake of wrongful economic benefit or for the wrongful loss to the Government of India
" Plotted

 Chandra said, "despite the confession by the defendant (CBI), the lower court in its order framing the charges wrongly connected the bribery charges to the Unitech Wireless Company
 ’ unhone kaha ki nichali adaalat kaa faisla maanya nahin he kyonki sibiai puure maamle main unhen jimmedaar nahin tehra saki
 The trial court had framed charges against Chandra under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki chandra ne license hasil karke doorsanchaar vibhaag ke saath dhokhadhadi kii jabaki samooh kii aath companiyaan aavedan ke samay license ke liye yogya nahin thim
 The lower court had said that prima facie it seems that Unitech Wireless (tamil Nadu) Private Limited was ineligible for 2G licenses and that the company wrongly made a huge profit by selling shares immediately after acquiring the license
 nichali adaalat ne isi faisle main anya aropiyon ke khilaaf bhi aarope tay kiye the

 ’ Priyanka, who arrived here on a two-day visit to Rae Bareli, said that Smriti is now the Minister of Human Resource Development, so what is the obstacle in setting up IIIT as promised in Rae Bareli? It is noteworthy that Smriti had attacked the gandhi-nehru family, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, on his Amethi tour on Tuesday, saying that till now the people of Amethi, who kept accepting the promises, will see development

 Instead of diminishing the political crisis in Maldives, tensions continue to rise
 vahaan se ab khabar aa rahi he ki maldive ke supreme court ne jin 9 bade rajanetaaon kii rihaai kaa aadesh diya tha, use ab waapas le liya he
 The Supreme Court has changed its verdict within 24 hours after President Abdulla Yameen imposed Emergency in the country on Monday

 The Chief Justice was later arrested and the decision was taken in his absence
 kal vahaan 2 bade jaj ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha

 These political prisoners also include exiled ex-president Mohammad Nasheed

 Mamun Abdul Gayoom, a former president who supported the opposition and was a brother in Yameen's relationship, was also placed under house arrest
 nashid ne is halaat main bharat kii madad maangi he
 Earlier, the 5-member judges of the country's apex court, while delivering their verdict on 1 February, ordered that former President and Leader of Opposition Nasheed should be removed from terrorism related cases and all 9 leaders should be released immediately
 court kii ore se raashtrapati ko raajnneetik kaidiyon ko reeha karne kaa aadesh dene or unke ise maanane se inkaar karne ke baad raajnneetik sankat kii shuruyaat ho gai
 The government had already sacked Parliament and ordered the army not to succeed if the Supreme Court tried to bring impeachment against President Abdullah Yameen
 baad main is aadesh ko dekhte hue raashtrapati yameen ne 15 din kaa apatkaal laga diya
 Within a few hours, 2 judges including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court were arrested
 maldive sarkaar ne surakshabalon ko yah aadesh bhi jari kiya ki ve supreme court ke un nirdeshon ko na maane jisamen raashtrapati yameen ko giraftaar karne yaa un par mahabhiyog chalaane kii baat kahi gai ho
 The top court had termed the ongoing trial on former President Mohammad Nasheed unconstitutional and also issued an order to release the imprisoned opposition's 9 mps, following an order that the opposition party in the Maldives seemed to gain a majority

 vaishvik str par trade war kii sthiti lagaataar kharaab ho rahi he
 First, the US announced additional tariffs of 25 and 10 per cent on steel and aluminum imports respectively
 jawaab main china ne america se emport hone vaale 128 utpaadon par 3 arab dollar kaa tarriff thok diya
 This conflict between the two countries is not ending here
 ab america ne china se emport ho rahe lagbhag 1300 utpaadon par 25 fisadi atirikt tarriff kaa elaan kiya he
 US President Donald Trump believes he is incurring a major trade deficit with his biggest trading partner, China
 trump prashasan ke is faisle scamericaco lagbhag 50 arab dollar kaa atirikt rajasav milane kii ummid he
 The US argues that Chinese companies are getting a direct benefit of trading in these products with China
 raashtrapati trump kii daleel he ki america ab vaishvik vyapaar main aisi nitiyon ke tahat kaam nahin karegaa jise america ko nuksaan pahunchane kii niyat se banaaya gaya he
 Significantly, the US alleges that China has resorted to a poor industrial policy intended to harm America
 trump kaa daawa he ki aisi audyogic niti na sirf vaishvik kaarobaar ke liye khatra he balki isse vaishvik suraksha par bhi khatra paidaa hota he
 China has made its stand clear on these decisions of the Trump government
 china sarkaarne kaha ki vah america ke saath kisi bhi mudde par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he
 But China has also claimed that if the US government is trying to wage a war against it in global business, then China will continue to oppose the US till the end in this war
 ise bhi padhein : america kaa aglaa daanv, china se 1300 utpaadon par lagayegaa adhik taxgauratlab he ki america sarkaar ne china ke jin 1300 utpaadon par tarriff badhaayaa he use vah aam karte hue desh main aam aadmi kii pratikriya lene ja rahaa he
 Following this response, the US government will release a list of all products on which an additional 25 percent tariff will be levied
 america sarkaar dwaara adhik tarriff ke liye prastaavit in 1300 utpaadon main uskaa sarvaadhik kaarobaar china ke saath hota he
 China and the US are each other's largest trading partners in the world and if business between the two is affected, it is legitimate to have a serious impact on global business
 america ne daawa kiya he ki china ke saath uskavyapaar ghatolgbhag 375 billian dollar kaa he or trump prashasan kisi bhi keemat par is ghate ko paatane ke liye taiyaar hai
 At the same time, China has questioned the trade deficit figures given by the Trump government
 china kaa kahana he ki america vyapaar ghate ke aankadon ko badhachadha kar dikhaa rahaa he
 India also has to reduce the trade deficit from China Like India, there is a big trade deficit between India and China in the business
 modi sarkaar ke liye is ghate ko paatane kii chunauti he
 Actually, this trade deficit simply means that we sell less products and services in China market than what we buy from China
 modi sarkaar lambey samay se koshish main he ki china se vyapaar ghate ko pata ja sake
 India's trade deficit with China is about $ 51 billion in the product sector, while in the services sector, the deficit is around $ 270 million
 vitt varsh 2017-18 april se janvari ke dauraan bharat ne china ko 10
 3 billion dollars while China exported about 63 to India
 2 billian dollar kaa aayaat kiya, lihaaja bharat ko is dauraan lagbhag 52

 jharkhand main bihari ab master saab nahin ban sakenge
 We are not saying this, rather it is the statement of the Education Minister of Jharkhand
 darasal mantri mahodaya ne soobe main shikshakon kii niyukti niyamavali main parivartan kii baat kah kar vivaadon kaa pitara khol diya he
 It says that those who have passed the recruitment examination from Bhojpuri and Magahi will be canceled
 aise main in bhashaaon se uteern hue hajaaron parikshaarthiyon kaa bhavishya adhar main latak gaya he
 At the same time, politics has also started fiercely on this issue
 darasal jharkhand kii shiksha mantri geethashri uraanv kaa ye bayaan in dinon khaasi charchaa main he ki magahi or bhojpuri se imtihaan dene vaale chaatro kii niyukti radd kii jaaegi
 The Education Minister has also issued this statement to the Ministry
 jharkhand main pehali baar vidhayak or mantri bani gita shri rahul gandhi kii elite team main shaamil hai or jharkhand ke kaddavar raajnneetik parivaar se taalluk rakhti hai
 Geetashree clearly says that Bhojpuri and Magahi is not a language, but only spoken
 aise main in vishyon ke mastaron ke liye jharkhand main jagah nahin he
 It is worth mentioning that about 65 thousand candidates were declared successful in the Teacher Appointment Examination (JTET) after a decade in the state and the process of their appointment started
 is bich shiksha mantri ke niyamavali ko badalane kii baat se rajya main nayaa vivaad shuru ho gaya he or isane rajya main arase se thande pade sthaniyata or bhashaai mudde ko hawa de di he
 The minister also says that the state of Bihar has already removed Jharkhandi languages from the appointment rules, in which case they have not done anything wrong
 vahiin is mudde ko lekar raajnneeti bhi shuru ho gai he
 While local tribal organizations are welcoming the move, a section of the state is very upset with it
 vahiin chunaavon ke maddenjar raajnneetik dal bhi is mudde par apane napha-nuksaan ko aankate hue bayaan de rahe hai
 Former Chief Minister of the state Arjun Munda says that this government does not want to hire a teacher who knows other regional languages
 darasal munda ke kaarykaal main hi JTET yani shikshak niyukti pariksha yojit kii gai thi
 At that time, the state government had sought applications from the candidates on the basis of regional languages spoken district-wise
 hairat kii baat yah he ki jharkhand main shikshakon kii niyukti lagbhag ek dashak pehle hui thi
 The only appointment exam that followed was canceled by the Jharkhand High Court due to wrong procedure
 lagata he ki is baar bhi niyukti kaa maamla sthaniyata ke pech main funs jayega
 On the other hand, in the state facing acute shortage of teachers, hundreds of middle schools are being converted into high schools every year
 aise main primary or middle skul ke shikshak hi hai skul main kakshaen le rahe hai or hakeekat yah he ki puure soobe main shiksha vyavastha charmara gayi he

 Faced with speculation of differences in the team, the Indian cricket team will take on Australia in a crucial match in Sydney on Sunday to keep their hopes alive in the tri-series
 team india agar yah match haar jaati he to uskaa sirf srilanka ke khilaaf ek match bachegaa or agar vah us match ko bonus ank ke saath bhi jeet legaa to bhi final main jagah banane kii uski raah aasaan nahin hogi
 If Sri Lanka also loses to Australia then both India and Sri Lanka will get the same 15 points
 aisi sthiti main net ran rate dekha jayega jisamen srilanka kii sthiti philhal kaaphi majboot he
 If India wins on Sunday, they will score equal points for Australia and in this case the final league matches of both teams will become very important
 ab sheersh par chal rahaa srilanka bhi final kii daud se baahar ho saktaa he basharte bharat or austrailia main se koi apane bache donon match jeet le or ek team ek match jeet le
 India will face Australia on Sunday, after which they will face Sri Lanka on 28 February
 shrinkhalaa kaa antim lig match do march ko austrailia or srilanka ke bich khelaa jayega
 Currently, India has 10 points, Australia 14 and Sri Lanka 15 points
 abhi bharat kii final main pahunchane kii sambhaavna sabase kam he
 The Indian team has also failed to play the full over of its quota in three of the six matches while its bowlers could not bowl out all the batsmen of the opposing team in any match
 ravivaar ke match ke liye sirf do tej gendbaajon ke feet hone se bharat kii mushkil or bad gai he
 Zaheer Khan is unavailable due to a calf injury while r Vinay Kumar, India's leading wicket-taker in the series, is also suspected to be playing due to a hamstring strain
 praveen kumaar feet hai lekin unki gati main kami ai he or ab vah pehle jitne prabhavi nahin lagate
 Umesh Yadav is seen as a strike bowler but in four matches in the current series, he has failed only three wickets in an average of 68 and an economy rate of over six runs per over
 unke paas gati or movement to he lekin line or length main nirantarata kii kami he
 As of now, the responsibility of the new ball will be on the shoulders of Umesh and Irfan Pathan
 agar bharat tisare tej gendbaaj ke saath utarataa he to phir praveen par bharosa karnaa hoga
 Or leg spinner Rahul Sharma will have to give a chance
 bharat kii ek or ahm samasya sheersh teen ballebaaj hai
 Despite the rotation system between them, Team India has not yet received a useful contribution from the opening pair
 bharat ke liye sarvshereshth salaami saajhedaari edilade main austrailia ke khilaaf rahi jab gautam gambhir or virendra sahvaag ne 52 ran jode jisase team dudhia roshni main 270 ran ke lakshya ko hasil karne main safal rahi
 Sachin Tendulkar and Sehwag have failed miserably in the series and have scored only 90 and 30 runs respectively
 gambhir ne haalanki do maukon par 90 ran se adhik kii paariyaan kheli hai
 Virat Kohli has tried to prove his talent by playing some good innings but Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina have failed in the series with 79 and 134 runs respectively
 bhartiya ballebaaj ummiido par khare nahin utre hai
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, however, has played his role of finisher well after playing good innings on a few occasions
 chah maichon main bharat kaa sarvshereshth score austrailia ke khilaaf 270 ran kaa lakshya hasil karnaa rahaa jabaki srilanka ke khilaaf use 230 ke aasapaas tak pahunchane main jujhna padaa
 Last week against the Australians in Brisbane, the team could only score 178 runs
 dhoni ne haalanki sanket die hai ki bharat ravivaar ko hone vaale match main teenon salaami ballebaajon tendulkar, sahvaag or gambhir ko utaar saktaa he
 This indicates that Rohit Sharma is almost certain to sit out
 duusari taraf austrailia ke ballebaajon ko bhi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The team has lost three of their six matches, of which two are against Sri Lanka
 austrailia kaa sheersh kram bhi bharat kii tarah ran jutaney main vifal rahaa he jabaki uske gendbaaj virdohi ballebaajon ke dephence ko bhedane main naakaam rahe hai
 The opening pair of David Warner and Matthew Wade have failed
 warner ne chah maichon main 20
 121 at an average of 16 while Wade scored 24
 83 ke ausat se 149 ran banaae hai
 Their best partnership was 70 against India in Brisbane
 warner ko haalanki antim ekadash main feet ho chuke shen watasan ke liye jagah banani pad sakati he
 Australia's batting so far has been completely dependent on its middle order
 riki ponting kii jagah tisare number par utre peter forest ne pichley match main shatak banaaya jabaki chot se ubre maaikel clark ne bhi umdaa pari kheli
 Hussey brothers Michael and David are also in good form
 team kii gendbaaji haalanki kuch samasya ho sakati he
 The trio of Bell Hilfenhaus, Brett Lee and Ryan Harris failed to defend a score of 280 against Sri Lanka at the Bellerive Oval on Friday night
 austrailia ke tej gendbaaj haalanki bharat ke khilaaf safal rahe hai
 Left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty scored 27 from six matches
 57 kii ausat se saat wicket or lagbhag chaar ran prati over kii ichonami rate se prabhavit kiya he

 yahaan vaishvik niveshkon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki sarkaar chunaav aane tak kai nirnyon or badlaavon ko lagu karegi
 Chidambaram has been meeting investors from the world since last week and this was his fourth meeting with investors
 chidambaram ne kaha ki in baithkon ke dauraan niveshkon ne raajnneetik sthirataa or sudhaaron ko aage badhaane main sarkaar kii kshamta par andeh prakat kiye
 In response to this, the Finance Minister said, "he hinted at the general elections to be held in 2014 and said that as the election draws closer, our feet will wobble
" ’ baithak ke baad chidambaram ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘maine unhen aashwast kiya ki chunaav hone main abhi 15 maheene baaki hai or aam bajet farvari main pesh kiya jayega jo ki ek jimmedaari bharaa bajet hoga or isamen kai nirnyon ko lagu kiya jayega
 'chidambaram said that there is no basis for investors' concern that' whatever we say, we will abdicate our responsibility in view of the election
 ’ unhone kaha ki agar ham sammelan main shaamil hone vaale logon kii sankhya or jo prashn unhone puche hai, use dekhen to saaf pataa chalata he ki bharat ke liye logo main paryaapt ruchi he

 After the selection of Anil Kumble as coach, there was more discussion about him than the discussion between Ravi Shastri and Saurabh Ganguly
 media ne is jhagade ko aise pesh kiya jaise is khabar ke alaava or koi khabar nahin he
 Ravi Shastri answered several questions while talking to the media about not becoming a coach, but the media only took more deeply the questions raised by Ravi Shastri over Saurabh Ganguly
 sirf media nahin kai purv cricketer bhi is jhagade main shaamil hote nazar aae
 Some players were seen standing with Saurabh Ganguly and some with Ravi Shastri

 Neither Ravi Shastri was speaking about this, nor any member of the advisory committee, nor the BCCI
 lekin phir bhi yah khabar media main chai hui thi
 a few days ago when NDTV tried to confirm the news from BCCI Secretary Ajay Shirke, Shirke had confirmed through an SMS that the work of the advisory committee was only to choose the head coach and not the batting coach
 shirke ne yah pushti nahin kii thi ki salaahkaar samiti ne batting coach ke rup main ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash kii gai tha yaa nahin? Then the question was raised by the media that if Shastri's name was offered as a batting coach then why did he not become a batting coach
 media ne shastri par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 It was also told that Shastri is infatuated and is not becoming a batting coach due to his pride
 lekin sach yah he ki salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy kaa jo mukhya kaary tha vah tha head coach chunanaa na ki batting coach
 It is the job of the head coach to elect his support staff, which has already happened
 aaj phir yah khabar media main chai hui he
 It has been reported in many newspapers that Saurabh Ganguly has stated that the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as the batting coach
 kai akhabaaron ne is khabar ko alag rup main prastut kiya he
 Then there is an attempt to pour ghee on this matter
 ganguli ne kai muddon par baat kii he jisamen kai ahm mudde bhi shaamil hai, lekin hadeline sirf batting coach ko lekar he
 After the statement of Ganguly, now this matter should be ended here
 kam se kam yah saaf ho gaya ki salaahkaar samiti ne ravi shastri ke naam kii batting coach ke rup main peshkash kii thi
 Now it has also become clear that Saurabh Ganguly has no estrangement with Ravi Shastri
 agar aisa hota to ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash nahin kii jaati
 The comments is puure maamle par nazar daalen to 1 june 2016 ko bisisiai kii taraf se team india ke head coach ke liye vigyaapan nikaala gaya tha
 Many big players had applied which included such brilliant players as Ravi Shastri, Anil Kumble, Praveen Amre, Sandeep Patel, Cricketer Tom Moody, Stuart Law
 21 june ko bisisiai kii taraf se coach chunane ke liye banaai gai salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy saurabh ganguli, sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana ne khilaadiyon kaa intervyuu liya tha or anil kumble ke naam par mohar lagaai thi
 Ravi Shastri, who succeeded Team India as a director, was angered by this decision
 unhone media ke saamne aakar apana naaraazgi jataai thi
 Ravi Shastri then accused Saurabh Ganguly that Ganguly was not present during his interview and by doing so he insulted Ravi Shastri
 pehle to ganguli is maamle par chup rahe lekin 29 june ko ganguli ne ravi shastri par hamalaa bol diya
 Ganguly said that if Shastri thinks that he could not become a coach because of Ganguly, then he is living in a world of fools
 ganguli ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar ganguli khud intervyuu ke dauraan maujuud nahin the to ravi shastri bhi nahin the
 Please tell that Ravi Shastri gave the interview through Skype
 jab intervyuu chal rahaa tha tab shastri bangkok main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe the
 Ganguly was also not present during Shastri's interview as he was busy in a meeting of the Bengal Cricket Association
 anil kumble kaa coach ke rup main chayan hone ke baad unako lekar jitani charchaa nahin hui usase zyada charchaa ravi shastri or saurabh ganguli ke bich hue manmutav ko lekar hui
 The media presented the quarrel as if there was no news other than this
 coach na banane par ravi shastri ne media se baat karte hue kai prashnon ke jawaab die lekin media ne sirf ravi shastri ke dwaara saurabh ganguli ke upar uthaae gaye sawaalon ko hi zyada gaharaai se liya
 Not just the media, many former cricketers also appeared to be involved in this quarrel
 kuch khilaadi saurabh ganguli ke saath khadey hue nazar aae to kuch ravi shastri ke saath
 It felt like two teams were formed
 ek team ke captain saurabh ganguli hai or duusari team ke captain ravi shastri
 Then it was reported in the media that Ravi Shastri's name was offered as the batting coach of Team India
 ek bade akhbaar ne pehle is khabar ko apane panne par jagah di
 But there was no official statement about it
 is bare main na ravi shastri kuch bol rahe the, na salaahkaar samiti kaa koi sadsy, na bisisiai
 But still this news was dominated in the media
 kuch din pehle enditivi ne jab bisisiai ke sachiv ajay shirke se is khabar kii pushti karne kii koshish kii to shirke ne ek esemes ke jariye yah pushti kii thi ki salaahkaar samiti kaa kaam sirf head coach chunanaa he, batting coach nahin
 Shirke did not confirm whether the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as the batting coach or not? phir media dwaara yah sawaal uthaaya gaya ki agar shastri ke naam kii batting coach ke rup main peshkash kii gai thi to phir vah batting coach kyon nahin bane
 The media also questioned Shastri
 yah bhi bataaya gaya ki shastri anhakaari hai or apane ghamand kii vajah se batting coach nahin ban rahe hai
 But the truth is that the main task of the member of the advisory committee was to choose the head coach and not the batting coach
 yah head coach kaa kaam hota he ki vah apane sahaayak staff chune, pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Today again, this news is covered in the media
 kai akhabaaron main yah khabar chhapi he ki saurabh ganguli ne yah kaha he ki batting coach ke rup main salaahkaar samiti ne ravi shastri ke naam kii peshkash kii thi
 Many newspapers have presented this news differently
 phir is maamle par ghi daalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Ganguly has spoken on many issues, including many important issues, but the headline is only about the batting coach
 ganguli kaa bayaan aane ke baad ab is maamle ko yaheen khatm kar dena chahie
 At least, it became clear that the advisory committee had offered Ravi Shastri's name as a batting coach
 ab yah bhi saaf ho gaya he ki saurabh ganguli kaa ravi shastri ke saath koi manmutav nahin he
 If that were the case, Ravi Shastri's name would not have been offered
 tippaniyan Looking at this entire matter, on 1 June 2016, an advertisement for the Head Coach of Team India was removed by the BCCI
 kai bade-bade khilaadiyon ne aavedan kiye the jisamen ravi shastri,anil kumble, praveen aamare,sandip patel, cricketer tom mudi, stuart lau jaise shandaar khilaadi shaamil the
 On June 21, Saurabh Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman, members of the advisory committee set up by the BCCI to select coaches, had interviewed the players and stamped on Anil Kumble's name
 team india ke diarector ke rup main safal rahe ravi shastri is nirnay se naaraaz the
 He expressed his displeasure by coming to the media
 iske baad ravi shastri ne saurabh ganguli par aarope lagaaya ki unke intervyuu ke dauraan ganguli maujuud nahin the or aisa karke unhone ravi shastri kaa apmaan kiya he
 At first, Ganguly remained silent on this matter, but on 29 June, Ganguly attacked Ravi Shastri
 ganguli kaa kahana tha ki agar shastri yah sochate hai ki ganguli kii vajah se vah coach nahin ban paae to vah moorkhon kii duniya main ji rahe hai
 Ganguly also said that if Ganguly himself was not present during the interview, Ravi Shastri was also not
 yah bataa den ki ravi shastri ne skip ke jariye intervyuu diya tha
 Shastri was holidaying in Bangkok while the interview was going on
 shastri ke intervyuu ke dauraan ganguli bhi maujuud nahin the kyonki vah bengal cricket association kii kisi meeting main vah vyast the
 Ravi Shastri answered several questions while talking to the media about not becoming a coach, but the media only took more deeply the questions raised by Ravi Shastri over Saurabh Ganguly
 sirf media nahin kai purv cricketer bhi is jhagade main shaamil hote nazar aae
 Some players were seen standing with Saurabh Ganguly and some with Ravi Shastri
 aisa laga ki do team ban gai hai

 unhone kaha ki hamen madhyapradesh or maharashtra sarkaar se is pariyojna ke liye ek bhi paisa nahin chahie, ham bas itnaa chaahate hai ki donon rajyon main is rail line ke liye adhigrahit jameen hamen nickshulk pradaan kii jaae

 The HR Ministry's decision to abruptly discontinue German studies in central schools hurt Germany so much that German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about this and got an assurance to see the controversy herself
 kareeb 1,100 skulon kaa sanchaalan karne vaala kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan (kevies) bhi german bhashaa kii padhai jari rakhana chahta he
 But the decision has been taken and many parties are being affected along with it

 That is, students studying German in third language will now have to study Sanskrit from class VI in the last months of the academic session

 "not effective" formula According to the trilingual formula included in the National Policy on Education of 1968, Hindi, English and any modern Indian language should be taught in schools
 iske peeche mul vichaar yah tha ki uttar bhartiya chaatr koi dakshin bhartiya bhashaa padhenge or dakshin ke kendriya vidyalayon ke chaatr hindi padhenge
 But the exception to the study of Sanskrit or any ancient Indian language was also added to modern Indian languages
 yah formula kendriya vidyalayon main utana kaamyaab nahin rahaa
 Students usually prefer to take Sanskrit as the third language, because their parents often have to change schools due to the transfer and hence there is no point in studying any regional language
 phir, 2008 main kevies ne german, french, japani, maderin or spanish jaisi videshi bhashaaon kii padhai shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 The study of foreign language was to be started as an additional language from VI to VIII and the study of German was started as a pilot project

 ’ The wait for the ointments on demonetisation has begun, but the pen killer is being searched in the old shops of subsidy and income tax, ie, to pay some money or a handful of concessions to the income tax payers in the account of the common people
 notebandi bharat ke taaja itihaas kaa sabase saahasik prayog he or iskaa bura asar khatm karne kaa tarika bhi utana hi saahasik hona chahie
 The real ointment of demonetisation is placed on the Prime Minister's table provided that he can muster up the courage to try it
 us maraham kaa naam he jiesti
 GST is currently in the mint of the government, which can be the most successful pain reliever of demonetisation, if it is turned into a revolutionary reform in reality
 acha jiesti maang waapas laa saktaa he, nivesh kaa maahaul badal saktaa he or kaale dhan kii chunauti kaa ilaaj ban saktaa he jo notebandi ke baad bhi maujuud rahegi
 But with the implementation of the GST format that we have now, not only will the problems of demonetisation be doubled, but the trouble of black money can increase further
 notebandi kii takalifon ke badale acha jiesti kaise game changer ho saktaa he?bharat main upbhog par bharpoor tex lagata he
 There are not only many types of taxes including excise, service tax, VAT etc
 but they also have many rates
 adhikansh kaala dhan khapat yani vyapaar par lagane vaale taxon kii chori se banataa he
 Traders want to pay tax but the business cost is very high
 tex kaa boj laabh ke margin simit kar detaa he isliye chori hoti he
 Tax levied at many levels is the cause of rapid inflation and reduction in demand
 jiesti ko in sabhi museebaton kaa ilaaj maan kar laayaa ja rahaa he
 But the tax structure approved by the GST Council has three gsts (center, State and Interstate) and five rates (0, 5,12,18 and 28 per cent)
 iske upar centre sarkaar ses lagaaegi
 States also want to impose cess, that is, GST will not be a game changer but will be similar to the current tax structure
 jiesti main nirmaataa or vikreta ko kachche yaa taiyaar maal par chukaaye gaye tex waapas milenge taaki antim upabhokta ko tex par tex kii maar va mahangaai se bachaaya ja sake
 But the multiple rate GST is making input credit extremely complex and challenging for businessmen
 to sarkaar se ab jis himmat kii darkaar he vah rahi yahanek—jiesti main keval do tex daren rakhi jaaen
 No three types of GST, no cess nor any other tax
 ek dar aam khapat vaale utpaada va sevaaon ke liye or ek lagjri utpaadon ke liye
 It can be 12 and 18 percent
 do—har tarah kii tex riyaayaton kii samaapti
 No turnover exemption limit, no special exemption for any industry
 teen—chote-bade sabhi tarah ke kaarobaariyon ke liye jiesti ke tahat anivaary registration, jaise ki aam logon ke liye pan anivaary he
 This change is possible because the GST law has not reached Parliament yet
 agar aisa jiesti hamen miltaa he to notebandi ke kai nuksaanon kii bharpai ho sakati havenotbandi ne khapat or maang ko tod diya he
 The current form of GST will not make any major contribution in reducing the tax burden, while two-rate GST will make large quantities of production and services cheaper
 yah mahangaai ko niyantrit rakhte hue maang ko nai takat de saktaa he
 It is needless to write that high tax, theft and black money are the reason
 maujuuda jiesti ke tahat kaarobaariyon ko 30 se 60 tak panjikaran va ritern bharne honge
 There is a fear of increasing the Compliance Cost
 ek acha sahaj jiesti kai tarah ke ritern panjikaran se mukti degaa
 Through compulsory registration for all traders, all types of production, distribution and consumption can be brought to the notice of tax, that is, the work which could not be done by demonetisation
 kam tex or sabhi kaarobaariyon kaa panjikaran rajyon ke liye zyada rajasav kii guarantee he
 The Central Government has already given guarantee to compensate the loss to the states
 kam tex, zyada maang or kaarobaari sahajata—yahi to chahie nivesh ke liye
 Whose atmosphere has been destroyed by demonetisation
 notebandi ke tahat aam log to tapasya kar chuke
 Now to make GST a big reform, the government will have to sacrifice and do austerity
 kharche ghataane honge, sarkari companiyon kaa nijeekaran karnaa hoga, ghaataa kam karnaa hoga or khapat par tarah-tarah ke baari tex va ses lagaakar upbhog ko chusane kii aadat chhodmai hogi
 Has Prime Minister Narendra Modi set the policy goals correctly? History will give the answer to this question, but comparing it between demonetisation and GST, it is not difficult to realize that instead of revolutionizing GST, the government invited the recession and unemployment by axing the feet of growth through demonetisation
 kam tex vaala jiesti kaarobaari paardarshita laa saktaa he jo kaale dhan par roak kii pehali shart he
 The remaining work can be done through cash transactions and setting limits on holding cash and gold, accounting reforms, making identification mandatory on land and gold purchases and transparency in political donations
 centre va rajyon ke bich jhagade main fanse jiesti ko pradhanmantri ke rajnatik netritv kii jarurat he
 If they can give the country a smooth and low inflation tax system, it will not only be India's biggest achievement after economic liberalization, but it will prove to be a bigger and far-reaching reform than demonetisation, which the country has been waiting for years

 tendulkar driver ke bagal main baitha karte the or usase kaha karte the ki tumhaare pita bade star hai
 My son also became a star at the end of the tour
 vah sirf 21 saal kaa he
 He received a letter of thanks from the Government of India
 ' It is worth noting that Jeff Goodwin drives the bus of most cricket teams during the England tour
 unhone 1999 world cap se team kii bas chalaanaa shuru kiya or behtareen sarvice di
 However, what Suresh Raina did is praiseworthy
 gauratlab he ki jeff gudwin england tour ke dauraan zyaadaatar cricket tiimon kii bas chalaate hai
 He started running the team bus from the 1999 World Cup and gave excellent service
 haalanki suresh raina ne jo kiy wo tarif ke kaabil he
 'I appeal to Australian fans to paint the Sydney Cricket Stadium yellow
 hamen aapke saath kii zarurat he
 ' yah twit he australia ke captain maaikel clark kaa
 Clarke fears that more Indian supporters from Australia may reach the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday during the semi-finals
 jab do tiimon ke bich takkar barabari kii maani ja rahi ho to aksar aise bade match main 'bechaini' kii bhoomika ahm ho jaati he or yahaan zyada 'baichaiyn' koun he, yah shaayad bataane kii zarurat nahin
 There are more reasons for trouble
 skool main aapane bhi shaayad 'prisht tanaav' yani 'sarfes tension' ke bare main padhaa hoga
 The 22 yards 'surface' of the Sydney Cricket Ground is also increasing the tension
 clark ke chahare par tanaav to padhaa bhi ja saktaa he, lekin captain kool mahendra singh dhoni kaa cheharaa is baar bhi bhav shunya he
 In fact, the pitch of the Sydney Cricket Ground is generally befriended by spin bowlers
 lekin world cap main pich apane mijaaz se sabko bhramit kar rahi he
 He did not get a single wicket when Australia fielded left arm orthodox Xavier Dohetri in the match against Sri Lanka
 us din australia or srilanka ke bich match main yahaan 688 ran bane
 South Africa scored 408 runs on the Sydney pitch against the West Indies
 protiyaaz leg spinner imran taahir ne westeindies ke kilaaf paanch or srilanka ke kilaaf chaar shikaar banaae
 Part-timer of spinner JP Duminy also had a hat-trick
 jate-jate pakistan ke captain misbah-ul-haq kangaaroon ko or bharamaa gaye
 He went on to say that the spinners would decide the outcome of the semi-final between current champions India and host Australia
 ab australian team ko lag rahaa he ki unki apni pich dushman team kaa saath de sakati he
 There is a fear that the pitch may not be dashed on his hopes of becoming a world champion
 lihaaza australia ne 'green top' kii maang kar daali he
 This demand is bound to cause some uneasiness in the Indian camp
 team india kii saat maichon main saat jeet ke peeche ek badi vajah yah bhi he ki is baar isisi ne world cap ke liye zyaadaatar batting wicket taiyaar kii he
 The ICC is thinking that more runs should be scored for more entertainment
 quarterfinal tak khele gaye 46 maichon main teen baar 400 se zyada ran or 24 baar 300 se zyada ran bane
 For the first time in a World Cup, two batsmen hit double centuries
 isaki sambhaavna kam hi he ki pich main aakiri samay main koi badlaav kiya jayega
 The ICC spokesperson clarified, 'the pitch curator cannot accept a team's request
 unhen 'sporting wicket' taiyaar karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Till now they have done this only
 ' Regardless of the pitch, unlike in Australia, the Indian team lacks confidence
 saat maichon main bhartiya gendbaazon ne sabhi 70 wicket lekar sabko chaunkaaya he
 Australia's bowling is strong, but it does not have the same diversity as India
 australia tej gendbaazon par nirbhar he, to bharat ke paas medium pesars or spinner to hai hi saath suresh raina or rohit sharma jaise part timer bhi hai jo dumini kii tarah australian ballebaazon ko hairaan kar sakate hai
 Pakistan fast bowler Wahab Riaz has shown that it is difficult, but not impossible, to make a dent in the fort of Kangaroos
 quarterfinal main wahaab kaa jabardast pradarshan ab bhi charchaa main he
 The 29-year-old Wahhab of Lahore intimidated Australia with his short pitch balls
 david warner or maaikel clark kaa wicket liya hi saath hi shen watson kaa kaich nahin chuta hota to match kaa natiza badal bhi saktaa tha
 However former Indian fast bowling coach Joe Dodge is apprehensive
 unhen nahin lagata ki umesh yadav, mohammad shami or mohit sharma main se koi bhi wahaab riyaaz kii tarah australian ballebaazon ko pareshaan kar saktaa he
 Dodge believes that Indian bowlers will not be able to replicate Wahab Riaz
 vah kehete hai, 've apana homework zarur kar rahe honge
 Duncan Fletcher is a very clever coach
 unki nazar in chizon par hogi
 But like Wahab, India does not have a left-arm bowler
 ' The first two bowlers to take the most wickets in the World Cup are left-handed
 newzealand ke trent bolt or australia ke michel stark ke baad tisare number par mohammad shami ne 13 kii ausat se ab tak 17 wicket liye hai
 Apart from the patience of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, there is another factor that can turn the match's favor to India is Virat Kohli's walk
 semifinal main upakptain kohli kaa balla bol padaa to 've vont giv it back' ko 've dind giv it back' badalane main koi mushkil nahin hogi

 Shatrughan Sinha, i
e
 'bihari Babu' of BJP, is angry with his own party these days, and this was clearly revealed by his statement when he praised the anti-aam Aadmi Party
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav 2015 ke liye party kii ore se prachaar ke liye utaare gaye shatrughna sinha ne saaf kaha, "agar 'aap' ke bare main sawaal kiye ja rahe hai, to iskaa matlab he 'aap' kii takat dikh rahi he
 
 
 In Mumbai style, 'aap' is going to boom
 
 
 'aap' kii pakad dikhaai de rahi he
 
 
 " unke bayanon se saaf he ki vah prachaar ke bahaane party ke sheersh netritv, khaskar pradhanmantri narendra modi or party pramukh amit shah par nishaanaa saadhane se nahin chook rahe hai
 Shatrughan Sinha has also used his own party more than his opponents in every interview before
 chaahe vah arvind kejariwal kii tarif karnaa rahaa ho, yaa yah salaah dena rahaa ho ki party ko nakaaratmak prachaar nahin karnaa chahie
 
 
 Whether it has been said that Harshavardhan would have been a better chief ministerial candidate in place of Kiran Bedi, or to say that encircling 'AAP' in the name of Chanda is not the right strategy
 lekin asal sawaal yah he ki 'bihari babu' naaraaz kyon hai
 Party leaders are said to have two main reasons for their displeasure - first, the party did not consider them worthy of campaigning in Maharashtra and Jharkhand before Delhi, while making Manoj Tiwari the star campaigner who addressed more than 40 gatherings there
 iske alaava 'bihari babu' yah bhi chaahate the ki modi sarakar unhen 'padam vibhushan' de, or iske liye unhone bihar kii jeetamram maanjhi sarkaar se apane naam kii anushansa bhi karwaai thi, lekin 'bihari babu' ke karibiyaan kii maane to pradhanmantri bhale hi unke bete kii shaadi main shaamil hue the, lekin unka naam khaarij karne main bhi unheen kii sakriy bhoomika rahi
 So, whenever 'bihari Babu' comes in front of the media or goes for publicity, he will try to harm the party by his statements more than his opponents, and in Delhi he did so
 ek ore jahaan yah tay he ki agar dilli chunaav kaa parinaam bijepi ke liye pratikul rahaa to 'bihari babu' aane vaale dinon main or mukhar honge, vahiin yah bhi pakkaa he ki party, khaskar rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah, bhi unhen haashiye par le jane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 Regarding keeping away from Bhagwat's comments publicly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, Lalu said it was not a 'sudden word of mouth', but a reflection of the 'thinking process' of the Sangh and the BJP

 In Bihar, the political atmosphere and the iftar is a strange coincidence and the situation is such that every iftar party brings some news, which starts getting removed
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav ke chalate aachaar samhita lagi hui thi or jisaki vajah se ramajaan ke maheene main koi bhi netaa iftaar nahin de sakaa
 Now with the election, the month of Ramadan has also come to an end
 anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa ki 5 yaa 6 june ko id he
 Now in these two-four days all the leaders want to settle iftar party
 halaat yah he ki patna main ek din main do se teen iftaar partiyaan yojit kii ja rahi hai or jis bhi iftaar main koi netaa nahin pahunch paata he ki vah khabaron main aa jaataa he
 Now iftar was organized by Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday
 isamen kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad, shahanvaj hossain sahit kai netaaon ne hissaa liya
 Iftar was organized by JDU shortly thereafter
 isamen bihar ke siem nitish kumaar, kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan or yahaan tak jeethanram maanjhi ne bhi hissaa liya
 Jitanram Manjhi had attended the iftar organized by RJD leader and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi before jdu's Iftar
 is iftaar menmahagathbandhan ke netaa maujuud the lekin yahaan tejasvi kii gairmaujuudagi nesabko chaunkaa rahi thi
 But speculation started about an event between these Iftar parties
 darasal hua yah he ki bijepi or jediu kii iftaar party bhi hui thi
 Neither bjp's leader was seen in jdu's Iftar nor bjp's leader in jdu's Iftar
 mana jane laga ki donon partiyon ke bich dooriyaan badhati ja rahi hai
 Because in the Modi cabinet where JDU refused to join, BJP has not found a place in Nitish's cabinet expansion
 lekin iftaar main na janaa koi badi baat nahin thi ki kyonki lagaataar ho rahi he iftaar partiyon menneta ek duusare se mulaakaat kar rahi hai
 On the other hand Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said that there is no dispute in NDA
 mantrimandal main jediu ke shaamil hone ko lekar jo bhi samasya he, jald hi uskaa samaadhaan kar liya jayega
 Paswan said that Nitish Kumar was also the face of NDA earlier and will continue to be so
 haalanki endie main sahyogi ramvilas paswan ko ummid he ki maamle kaa samaadhaan ho jayega
 In this case both Nitish Kumar and Deputy Sushil Kumar Modi have given clarification
 isi bich jediu ke mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kah diya ki jediu ab bhavishya main kabhi endie ke mantrimandal main shaamil nahin hogi
 Let me tell you that even today three main iftar parties are being organized in Patna

 One document raised the possibility that China provided a comprehensive package of nuclear weapons design to its close ally Pakistan in the late 1970s and the CIA was aware of it
 is dastavej kaa khulaasa haal hi main kiya gaya he
 According to these documents, acquired from the National Security Archives (NSA) under the Freedom of Information Act, the CI had evidence that pointed to close nuclear cooperation between Pakistan and China
 is dastavej ke anusaar, pehle bhi aise aarope lage hai, jaise videsh mantralay ke ek dastavej main or kai badi khabaron main, lekin aisa pehali baar hua he ki siie ne apni kuch suchanaaen saarvajanik jari kii hai
 The comments isamen kaha gaya he, is anumaan main kuch mukhya gatividhiyon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he, jinamein varsh 1974 main pakistan ko ek parmaanu visphot kii kshamta viksit karne main madad dene ko ‘maukhik sahmati’, varsh 1976 main parmaanu hathiyaar takanic muhaiyaa karaane jaise ghatnakram hai
 Also, there is some information that makes it likely that China provided comprehensive information about the design of nuclear weapons
 siie dwaara varsh 1983 ke rashtriya str ke ek khufia anumaan main kaha gaya he, china kii madad ke bina bhi pakistan ek parmaanu hathiyaar banane main sakasham he, lekin china ke hathiyaar dizin or pareekshan aankade bagaiyr pareekshan vaali kshamta main islamabad kaa aatmavishvaas badhaane main kaaphi mahatvapurn ho sakate hai
 It stated that this flow of information was probably not one-sided and that China's "involvement" in Pakistan's nuclear enrichment program was probably related to the gas centrifuges technology that Pakistan took from China
 dastavej main kaha gaya he ki parmaanu prasar jimi carter ke prashasan kii niti kaa ek pramukh hissaa tha or pakistan evam china dwaara parmaanu hathiyaaron se sambandhit saajhedaari kii sambhaavna se america sarkaar ke adhikari chintit ho uthe the, lekin siie ke paas ko thos saboot nahin the

 According to this document, there have been allegations in the past, such as in a Foreign Ministry document and in many big news, but this is the first time that the CIA has released some of its information to the public
 tippaniyan It said, some major activities have been pointed out in this estimate, including 'verbal consent' to help Pakistan develop the capability of a nuclear explosion in 1974, developments such as providing nuclear weapons technology in the year 1976
 Huh
 saath hi kuch aisi suchanaaen hai, jinase yah sambhaavna banati he ki china ne parmaanu hathiyaar ke dizin sambandhi vyapak soochna muhaiyaa karai
 a 1983 national-level intelligence estimate by the CIA states that Pakistan is capable of building a nuclear weapon even without China's help, but China's weapon design and test data are a substantial boost to Islamabad's confidence in untested capability
 Can be important
 isamen kaha gaya he ki soochnaaon kaa yah pravaah shaayad ekatarfa nahin tha or pakistan ke parmaanu sanvardhan kaarykram main china kii ‘‘sanliptata’’ shaayad gas centriphyus takanic se sambandhit thi, jo pakistan ne china se lee
 The document stated that nuclear proliferation was a major part of Jimmy Carter's administration's policy and that US government officials were concerned by the possibility of a nuclear weapons partnership by Pakistan and China, but the CIA did not have solid evidence
 
 isamen kaha gaya he, is anumaan main kuch mukhya gatividhiyon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he, jinamein varsh 1974 main pakistan ko ek parmaanu visphot kii kshamta viksit karne main madad dene ko ‘maukhik sahmati’, varsh 1976 main parmaanu hathiyaar takanic muhaiyaa karaane jaise ghatnakram hai

 ummid he ki uske baad donon deshon ke videsh sachivon kii baithak hogi
 The Indian High Commissioner himself has said that the meeting of foreign secretaries will not be linked to the Pathankot investigation
 bharat ne pehle pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko is hamale kii sajeesh rachane vaala bataaya he
 Seven security personnel and a civilian were killed in the attack
 bharat ne is hamale ke liye pakistan yaa uski sansthaaon kii ore anguli uthaane se parhez kiya tha

 desh kaa himalayan rajya uttarakhand in dinon do vajahon se charchaa main he
 First- from traffic jams around the tourist and religious places of both Garhwal and Kumaon divisions of Uttarakhand
 doosraa- dehradun ke paas auli main kaarobaari gupta bandhuon ke parivaar kii shahi shaadi se
 Both incidents are knowingly and unknowingly spoiling the environment of Uttarakhand and weakening the mountains
 uttarakhand ke nainital, bhavali, musuri, auli, rishikesh, kedarnath or badrinath samet kai dharmik or paryaton sthalon par is samay logon kii bharmaar he
 These days, tourists from the nearby states are arriving here in search of relief and relief from the heat
 apane privet vaahanon se aane vaale ye paryatak kai tarah se rajya ko aay muhaiyaa kara rahe hai, lekin paryaavaran ko nuksaan bhi pahunchaa rahe hai
 At the same time, crores of rupees are being spent in the marriage of Gupta brothers' family in Auli
 uttarakhand ke is ilaake main pre-wedding shoot kaa chalan bhi badha he
 In Auli, the Gupta brothers are also going to have a vision of Badrinath to their guests with 200 helicopters
 itane saare helicopter kaa ek saath badrinath jaisi samvedansheel ghati main utarana chintajanak he
 Their vibration and sound will also have a serious impact on the mountains
 gadiyon ke rele se jam hua pahaadrudaki se haridwar or rishikesh jane vaale raaston par pichley hafte lagbhag har din sadak jam rahi
 The situation was worse on weekends
 isse aage badrinath or kedarnath ke raaston par sadaken is kadar jam padi thim ki petrol-dijal lekar aa rahi gaadiyaan petrol panpon tak nahin pahunch sakin or logon ko keval 5-5 litre eendhan diya ja sakaa
 Trains to Nainital were stopped by the police at several places including Haldwani, Kathgodam and only those who had pre-booking of the hotel were allowed to go further
 isse paryatakon or sthaneey nivaasiyon donon ko pareshaani jhelni padi or kai logon ko to raste se hi waapas lautnaa padaa
 Since the 80s, Uttarakhand has had a crowded pilgrimage or tourism in Uttarakhand
 lekin 80 ke dashak ke baad yah chintajanak rup se badha he
 Senior journalist and social activist Rajiv Lochan Sah considers three reasons behind this - the policy of liberalization, the unrest of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and the popularization of Maruti 800 in the meantime
 vah bataate hai ki pehle punjab or phir jammu-kashmir ke ashaant hone kii vajah se paryatak uttarakhand ke shant or pahari ilaakon main aane lage or baad main apni kaaron se aane lage
 This increased congestion in the mountainous areas during the summer, which has now turned into several hours of jam
 vah kehete hai ki duniya ke sabase mahange shaharon switzraland or jurikh main kaaren dekhne ko nahin milti hai
 All traffic there depends on public transport
 dharm or aadhyatm nahin suvidha talash rahe logaparyavarnavid or lekhak sopan joshi kehete hai ki upabhoktavaadi samskruti main shaharon kaa jivan bahut rangeen dikhaaya jaataa he, jabaki asal main aisa hota nahin he
 Tired of these 5 days of life, people reach the nearest hill stations for two days on weekends
 vah kehete hai ki pehle pahaado kii dharmik yatra kshtprad hoti thi, ab aisi yatraaon main dharm or aadhyatm kaa tatv kam hokar inhen suvidhajanak bana diya gaya he
 Sopan says that local and public vehicles should be run instead of individual vehicles in places like Uttarakhand
 isse pahaado par berogari or palaayan donon kii samasya kaa bhi samaadhaan hoga kyonki keval paryaton se in samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin hua he
 The parking will not solve the problem: To prevent jam of the state, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced a multistory parking
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kareeb 1000 kaaron kii kshamta vaali is parking se peak sijan main jam kii samasya hal ho jaaegi
 But widening the narrow roads of the mountains and creating parking will not solve this problem
 rajeev lochan saah kehete hai ki keval parking banane se jam kii samasya kam nahin hogi
 The number of cars is increasing every year so that parking and roads will be reduced
 gadiyon kii bikri ko lekar deshvyapee niti banani hogi, lekin sarkari nitiyaan automobile industry or sadakon ke thekedaaron ke liye banaai gai lagati hai
 He further says that places like Nainital are open throughout the year, so people should also avoid visiting here
 ye jagahen pesh kar rahi hai udhaahrandesh main kai paryatak sthal hai jo nazeer pesh kar rahe hai
 Hornets are also banned at many tourist destinations in the northeast, including Gangtok, so that mountains and wild animals are not disturbed due to the sound waves
 isi tarah maharashtra ke hill stesan matheran main vyaktigat vaahanon ko jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 You can reach here only on foot or by horse riding
 aisa is jagah ko pradooshan or nuksaan se bachaane ke liye kiya gaya he
 Vehicles cannot go on Elephant Island in Maharashtra
 yahaan par naav se pahunchaa ja saktaa he or iske baad paidal yaa choti miniechar train se ghumaa ja saktaa he
 Malrod in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh is also a car free area
 punjab ke fajilka main commercial aria ko car free ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Apart from these, we should look at the small cities of Europe which are very sensitive to their forests, mountains and environment
 outer dilli ke mundaka swarna park ilaake main pivisi ke ek godaam main achaanak aag lag gai
 On seeing the flames of fire started coming out of the warehouse
 is aag main lakhon kaa maal jal kar khaak ho gaya
 The fire started late Thursday evening, when many people were present in the warehouse
 tabhi ek majdoor ko ek kone se dhooaan nikalate dikhaa, usne turant shor machana shuru kiya, shor sunakar log baahar kii taraf nikle, abhi koi kuch samaj paata kiag kii lapten nikalanishuru ho gayi
 It is a matter of honor that all the people inside the warehouse got out in time
 police or fire vibhaag ko tunrat aag kii soochna de di gai thi
 Fire cars had also reached the spot, but the fire took a rare form within minutes
 fire vibhaag kii ek darjan gadiyon ko aag par kaabo paane main kareeb teen ghante kaa vakt lag gaya or jab aag buji to godaam ke andar chaaron taraf sirf raakh hi raakh maujuud thi
 How the fire started has not been cleared yet
 fire ke adhikari ne kaha ki vah us vakt godaam main maujuud logon se baat kar rahen hai, ashanka he ki aag kii vajah short circuit he
 Fire personnel say that PVC goods were kept in the warehouse, which catch fire very quickly, due to which the fire spread quickly and was not extinguished
 godaam ke maalik kaa kahana he ki abhi tak nuksaan kaa puri tarah se aankalan nahin ho paaya he

 Seeing the last show of Sach Ka Saamna, a woman from Agra embraced death
 police ke mutabik roopa ganguli kii jindagi ke tamaam sach sunne ke baad tivi par sho dekh rahi pallavi khub roi
 Pallavi saw her own picture in Rupa Ganguly and she too made the same mistake that Rupa Ganguly regrets
 uske baad pallavi ne khudakushi kar lee
 Police recovered suicide notepallavi wrote suicide letter in first diary of suicide and whipped himself heavily in it
 har galati ke liye usne khud ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 She was yearning to meet her son who is with her ex-husband
 pallavi kaa apane shaadishuda bwoyfriend dharmendra aryaa ke saath liv-in-relation tha or wo agra main je aar silver estate main rah rahi thi
 But according to Dharmendra, Pallavi could not recover from such drowning in her old memories
 sho khatm hone ke baad bhi wo apane purv pati raaj or bete paavi ko yaad kar-karke khub roi or phir pankhe par faansee kaa fanda lagaakar jhul gai
 Pallavi Dharmendra got emotional after watching the serial and told the police that Pallavi felt Roopa Ganguly's life
 sho main sawaalon ke jawaab dete-dete roopa ganguli apane pati se dur rahane or apane bete kii yaad aane kii baat karte-karte bhavuk ho uthin or pallavi ke man main bhi saath hi uthne laga bhaawanaaon kaa jowar

 They both had a son named Pavi
 lekin paanch saal pehle pallavi kaa raaj se talaak ho gaya
 Then he met Dharmendra at a wedding in Delhi and despite Dharmendra being married, Pallavi made a living in relationship with him
 lekin puraani yaadon ke haaavee hote hi pallavi pachhataave kii aag main jalane lagi
 In the suicide note, he said that he was responsible for all the good in this world, i am the only one who could not handle any relationship properly
 na maa kaa, na beti kaa, na patni kaa or na bahan kaa
 Being in this world is a problem, so i am going
 aap sabase dur
 i am responsible for my decision, no one else
 aryaa ek achche insaan hai par main uski rakhel banakar nahin rahanaa chaahati hum
 i can never forget Raj and Pavi, so my life is worthless
 bas ek baar mere marane kii khabar paavi ko jarur de dena, wo chaahe to aa jaae
 i love you all the most, but my life is getting painful for you all, so bye

 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri bane mushkil se ek haftaa hua he
 On the other hand, in Maharashtra, BJP is entangled with its oldest ally Shiv Sena for the post of Chief Minister
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle donon paksh apane apni taraf se mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaaron ke naam de rahe hai
 So far there has been agreement between BJP Shiv Sena that Shiv Sena contests assembly elections on 171 seats and BJP on 117 seats
 par ab bijepi rajya main shivasena ke bade bhai kaa kad raas nahin aa rahaa
 The BJP wants to get out of the shadow of Shivsena
 kuch bijepi netaaon ko lagata he ki bina balasaheb kii shivasena ke paas koi or chaara nahin he
 Whatever agreement the BJP makes, the Shiv Sena has to stay with it
 isliye bijepi kii taraf se abhi se gopinath munde or devendra fadanvis kaa naam uchhaala jane laga he
 But Shiv Sena is not ready to give up its land at all
 sanjay raut ne kaha he party chaahati he uddhav thakare mukhyamantri bane
 He said that the next CM of Maharashtra would be from his party
 agar rajya main koi badlaav laa saktaa he to sirf shivasena laa sakati he
 But after the victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP is assuming that the old agreement will no longer run
 seat or mukhyamantri pad ko lekar baatcheet nae sire se hogi
 The controversy started when the BJP hinted at making state president Devendra Fadnavis a chief ministerial candidate a few days ago
 is par fadanvis ne kaha tha ki gopinath munde khud mukhyamantri banane laut aaenge, rajya ne unhen udhaar par kendra bheja he
 Which was printed today in the face of whether Modi approved this loan and loan business
 mukhyamantri banane ke liye logon ne qamar kas lee he
 In fact, in the BJP, there has been a meeting on this issue
 ye mahatvapurn he
 BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis even went as far as to say that BJP leader Gopinath Munde has been given on loan in Delhi for three months
 teen maheene ke baad unhen byaaj samet vasuul kar lenge
 Three months later Munde will be brought to the state
 abhi bijepi kaaryakarta ye bhi kehane lage hai ki kendra main narendra or rajya main devendra
 Many leaders were worried about this
 balki munde bhi khud kehane lage, desh main narendra rajya main devendra
 Munde says Devendra is perfect and Devendra says that he has sent Munde to Delhi on a loan of three months
 lekin bijepi kii ye nai byaaj dar kya narendra modi ko maanya he jo bhi saavkaari or byaaj dhandha karegi wo sirf maharashtra kii janata karegi
 After the Lok Sabha, the stage of elections has become smaller but according to the politics, Hasrat is not small, here Narendra Modi does not matter for Shiv Sena
 yahaan balasahab kaa sapana mahatvapurn he
 It was started by Uddhav's younger brother Raj to declare himself CM
 unhone hi sabase pehle maharashtra vidhansabha ke chunaav main khud ko mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke rup main pesh kiya
 Then came great contenders
 maharashtra main pichley sabhi maukon par bijepi shivasena kii sarkaar main mukhyamantri kii kursi shivasena ko mili he
 But this time the BJP is full of confidence
 desh main damdaar pradarshan ke baad use maharashtra ke chunaav main jeet tay dikh rahi he or mukhyamantri kii kursi nikat bhavishya kaa satya
 But the equation in the state's politics is a bit complicated, and the claim is equally strong for the Shiv Sena
 landan olympic main asaadhaaran pradarshan karne vaali china kii khilaadi ye shiven ko america ke ek sheersh coach ne ‘sandigdh’ bataate hue uski tulana povi germany ke maadak padaarth ke aadi khilaadiyon se kii he

 On behalf of the Muslim side, Meenakshi Arora, Shekhar Nafde argued that there is an archaeologist who can deny the report, daily hearing is going on in the Supreme Court on the Ayodhya dispute
 isi bich shuukravaar ko shriram janmabhumi maamle main 33wein din sunwaayee hui
 Beginning the debate on behalf of the Muslim side, Meenakshi Arora said that different experts have different opinions on the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) report
 unhone kaha ki yah vaigyanik kam or kalpana par zyada aadhaarit he
 Meenakshi said that the report does not prove that there was construction of Gupta period also
 jis mahal kii baat kii ja rahi he, uskaa nirmaan madhyakaal kaa he
 He said that it is wrong to call him a 12th century temple
 use divya kahana bhi uchit nahin
 Counsel for the Muslim side said that the round dome on the structure was also six-sided
 justise nazeer ne kaha, report kii pramanikta par sawaal nahin uthaa saktejustise nazeer ne kaha ki aap yah kah rahi hai ki puraatatv bhi puri tarah se vigyaan nahin he, or section 45 is par lagu nahi hota he
 He said the ASI report was investigated and objections were considered
 aap report kii pramanikta par sawaal nahin uthaa saktin, kyonki ek kamishnar ne yah report di jo jaj ke samaan the
 On this comment, Meenakshi Arora said that the archeology department has said that every archaeological officer prepares the picture according to his thinking
 usee ke aadhaar par vah nishkarsh tak pahunchane kii koshish karata he
 Archaeological science works only on the lines of headwriting science
 unhone kaha ki ek puraatatv vaigyanik kii raay duusare se aamtaur par nahin milti
 Meenakshi said that fingerprint checking is absolutely accurate, as it is considered correct if the percentage of matching is much higher
 justise bobade ne kaha, koi aisa puraatatv vigyaani he jo report nakaar sakejustise bobade ne kaha ki kya aapke paas koi aisa puraatatv vaigyanik he jo ASI kii report nakaar sake, jaise aap nakaar rahi hai
 On this, Meenakshi Arora said that the opinion of the witnesses presented by the Hindu side was also different from the archeology department
 jayanti prasad shrivastav, ritred puraatatv adhikari ne vibhaag kii report se itar raay rakhi
 Important point-of-day cross-justice Bobde said that there was no direct evidence on both sides
 sabhi paksh kaa maamla puraatatv report ke najariye par tikaa hua he
 Arora said that in the report of the Department of Archeology, nowhere was said that such a place is a Ram temple
 jabaki ram chabutare ko water tanks bataaya gaya he
 Meenakshi Arora completed her arguments
 aroda kii daleelon kaa saransh ye rahaa ki unhone court se ASI kii report par puri tarah se bharosa na karne kii baat kahi
 Meenakshi Arora tried to falsify the report of the Department of Archeology citing an earlier decision of the Supreme Court
 minakshi ke baad muslim pakshakaron kii taraf se vakil shekhar nafde ne bahes shuru kii

 raghubar das ne mandir nirmaan ke liye suut daakhil kiya tha
 On whose behalf there was a demand for construction of the temple, describing the platform as the place of birth
 uskaa byora bhi unhone diya
 In 1885, the Deputy Commissioner gave his ruling on the suit of Raghubar Das and rejected the claim of building the temple on the platform
 aise main yah res jeudi kaata yani nyaayik samiksha kaa maamla he
 (race Judy Kata (section 11 of CPC) means' Once a dispute is settled between two parties, a suit cannot be filed again for the same dispute in the same case between the same parties
 )justise bobade ne kaha ki ek baat to saaf he ki vahaan par kabje ko lekar vivaad tha
 So was the dispute only with the Ram platform or the whole place? Nafde said that Hindus had a right to some land there
 unka sirf ram chabutare par adhikaar tha, ve swaamitv hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe the jise asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 He tried constantly to encroach
 nafde ne kaha ki nyaayik kamishnar ne apane aadesh main saaf kiya tha ki hinduon kii pahunch simit kshetra tak thi
 He was trying to increase it, but it was identified that his authority was limited and he could not be given ownership
 shekhar nafde ne kaha ki mahant raghubar das kii ore se daakhil kiya gaya 1885 kaa suut unka vyaktigat kadam tha
 Nafde said that it is clear that the suit which was filed in 1885 was filed on the platform for the right of worship
 justise chandrachun ne kaha 1885 kaa jo suut he, vah nirmohi akhaada kii taraf se nahin he
 He was filed by a mahant
 yah kahana ki hindu paksh dobaaraa cese file nahin kar saktaa, yah thik nahin lagata
 The Chief Justice asked Shekhar Nafde, counsel for the Muslim parties, by when will you complete your plea
 iske jawaab main shekhar nafde ne kaha ki 2 ghante or
 The Chief Justice said that we will not change our schedule
 After the stipulated period of time, the Chief Justice said that your argument is complete
 is par shekhar nafde ne kaha ki mujhe 30 minute or diya jaae
 The CJI said that the debate is not going according to schedule
 CJI justise ranjan gogoi ne aaj phir kaha ki sunwaayee ke shedul ham nahin badalenge
 The Hindu side has to debate according to schedule on Monday
 sunwaayee somvaar ko bhi jari rahegi

 While the government is reporting its victory on the Rafale report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) presented in Parliament, the Opposition is still not ready to believe that the deal has not gone wrong
 CAG report main kaha gaya he ki modi sarkaar ne jo deal kii he, vah upie kii deal se kul 2
 86 percent cheaper
 haalanki is report main sieji ne bhi kai aise binduon ko sweekaar kiya he, jinka is saude ko lekar sawaal uthaane vaale log sanket karte rahe hai
 Some of the major points are as follows - 1
 keemton kii tulana mushkilsbase pehle yah baat samaj len ki sieji ne rafel par apni audit report kii shuruyaat main hi yah saaf kar diya he ki upie or endie, donon saudon main keemat kii bilkul sahi tulana nahin ho sakati
 The reason for this was that the proposed deal during the UPA involved licensing Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the production of aircraft in India
 lekin modi sarkaar ke saude main aisa kuch nahin he
 The CAG has said, "there are many difficulties in comparing the 2007 and 2015 offers, such as the 2007 proposal also included the license production price of 108 aircraft in India, whereas the 2015 proposal only talks about flyaway aircraft
 
 isliye tulana sirf 18 fliave vimaanon ke keemat kii ho sakati he
 2
 eurocafter ne kii thi 20 fisadi sasta dene kii peshkashreport ke anusaar jab upie sarkaar ke saude main gatirodh aa gaya tha to uske baad nai sarkaar banane ke baad july 2014 main eurocafter banane vaali company eadies ne rafel se 20 fisadi kam keemat par vimaan dene kii peshkash kii thi
 But the Ministry of Defense did not accept this offer due to some reasons
 3
 The 57% lower price offer was made impractical
 The negotiating team on behalf of India had set the benchmark price based on the expectation of discount, market study and sale price reported in Dasha Aviation's annual report from the initial offer of the French company
 Was about 57 percent less
 haalanki sieji ne bhi is keemat ko avyaavhaarik bataaya he
 4
 na to bank guarantee or na hi sovrain guaranteereport main kaha gaya ki pehle tay kiya gaya tha ki francisi company saude par 15 fisadi kii bank guarantee degi
 The Ministry of Law and Justice had suggested that banks and sovereign guarantees be taken from France on the deal
 lekin na to company is par bank guarantee dene ko taiyaar hui or na hi france kii taraf se koi sovrain guarantee di gai
 a 'letter of Comfort' was provided in its place
 5
 Due to non-receipt of bank guarantee, Dassar has said in the report that the money which is remaining of the vendor i
e
 Dasso should be got by the Ministry of Defense due to non-payment of bank guarantee and bank charge
 raksha mantralay ne sienji ke is anumaan ko sweekaar kiya ki company kii is mad main kitni bachat ho rahi he
 But the Ministry said that this is not applicable in the new proposal
 lekin sieji kaa kahana he ki yah 2007 kii tulana main daso aviation ko ek tarah kii bachat hi he
 6
 samay se aapurti par ndehsieji kii report ke anusaar bhartiya nigoshiation team ne is bare main andeh kiya tha ki vimaanon kii aapurti 71 maheenon ke tay avadhi main ho paaegi
 The team had said that Dassau produces 11 aircraft every year and looking at the backlog, it seems that if the same speed is maintained, the supply will take more than seven years
 is par raksha mantralay ne kaha ki daso ke project samay par chal rahe hai or isaki ek antar sarkari dwipaksheeya team ke dwaara gaharaai se nigaraanee kii ja rahi he

 apni lekhnee se unhone ye vichaar samaaj ko diya ki koi bhi vyakti janm ke aadhaar par shreshth nahin hota he
 His lines, 'raidas Babhan Mat pooji jo howe geun hein, pooje charan chandal ke jo ho geun parveen' are still teaching people
 samtamulak siddhant kii jis theory ko unhone us jamaane main bataane kii koshish kii, dekha jaae to aaj bhi unki is avadharana par aawaaj uth rahi he

 The NPP is confident of its success after being able to break eight legislators of the ruling Congress
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baavjood mukhyamantri mukul sangama bhi apni jeet ko lekar aashwast hai
 They are relying on the victory of the "congress who brings stability" in a state which has been infamous for frequent power changes
 duusari taraf, jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki meghalaya main sabase badi vipakshi party united democratic party (udipi) or kuch nirdaleey vidhayak asli 'kingmekar' banakar ubhar sakate hai
 The Naga People's Front (NPF) in Nagaland has ended its alliance with the BJP
 haalanki bhaajapa netaa is 'talaak' ko lekar zyada munh nahin khol rahe lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki bhagava party nai naveli neshnal democratic progressive party (andipeepi) ke saath gathbandhan karne kii yojana bana rahi he

 The legislators who quit the party include six Trinamool Congress leaders and five leaders of the IPFT (before the announcement of the alliance)

" '' lekin mul nivaasiyon ke liye alag 'tviparalland' kii maang karne vaali ipift ke saath gathbandhan uske liye samasya ban saktaa he
 The saffron party would never want it to be seen as a party that supports the demand to isolate the state's majority Bengali population

 The Lord Shriram (cont) https: / / t
 co / tticznrtgl What is the option to form a government in Maharashtra, will the President rule or will the government be formed, who will take over the power of Maharashtra and whose government will be formed, this picture is not clear yet
 rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ke nimantran dene ke baad bhi bijepi ne sarkaar banane se peeche hat gai he to shivasena tay samay seemaa par bahumat kaa samarthan patr nahin saunp saki
 In such a situation, the Governor has invited NCP to form the government, who will have to present a claim to form the government with a letter of support by 8 pm
 bijepi or shivasena ke baad agar ensipi bhi bahumat ke aankade jutaney kii pariksha main fail hoti he to maharashtra raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane kii charchaa jor pakadegi
 In such a situation, there are many more options in front of the Governor as well as President's rule in Maharashtra in terms of constitutional expert and Rajya Sabha member Subhash Kashyap
 subhash kashyap kehete hai kimaharashtra main jab tak nayaa mukhyamantrinhin mil jaataa, tab tak rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari mukhyamantri pad se istipha dene vaale devendra fadanvis ko kaaryvahak mukhyamantri ke taur par kaam karne kaa aadesh de sakate hai
 He said that under the Constitution, it is not necessary that the term of the Chief Minister ends with the Assembly, because the new Assembly has come by electing
 haalanki devendra fadanvis ne sarkaar banane se inkaar kar diya he
 Subhash Kashyap says the second option in Maharashtra is that Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari can make any leader of the party that wins the most seats in the assembly election results as the Chief Minister
 is lihaaj se bijepi kaa nayaa mukhyamantri ban saktaa he, kyonki maharashtra main uske sabase zyada 105 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 However, after becoming CM, the BJP will have to prove its majority in the assembly
 bataa den ki 2014 main bijepi ne aise hi maharashtra main sarkaar banaai thi or ensipi floor test ke dauraan vidhansabha se walkout kar gai thi
 In this way, the BJP formed a minority government
 philhal is baar jo siyaasi halaat hai, us lihaaj se bijepi ke paas bahumat kaa aankada jutanaa mushkil he
 In such a situation, BJP will not take such risky steps
 iske alaava bhagat singh koshyari rajya gathan ke liye tisare vikalp ke taur par maharashtra vidhansabha se apane netaa ko chunaav ke jariye chunane kii ijaajat de sakate hai
 For this, they can form the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court
 saal 1998 main supreme court ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha main aisa karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 In spite of all these options, if no government is formed in Maharashtra, then there will be no way for the Governor except to recommend the President
 bijepi ke kadam khinchne ke baad congress-ensipi shivasena ke saath aane se parhez kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there seems to be a strong possibility of President's rule
 andhra pradesh ne apni do badi nadiyon godavari or krishna ko jodne ke liye aaj aitihaasik kadam uthaaya
 This is being seen as a boon for Krishna Delta farmers who are facing water shortage
 nadiyon ke jode jane se godavari nadi kaa kareeb 80 tiemasi pani ek nahar ke jariye krishna main le jaaya jayega
 Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu inaugurated the formal inauguration of these two rivers
 krishna or guntur jilon main pani kii ghor kami kaa saamana kar kisaanon ke liye yah kadam bahut laabhakaari mana ja rahaa he
 Actually, these districts were facing problems due to the height of the Almaty Dam by Karnataka

 Since September 1, the government is conducting tests under which water is being pumped into the canal from the Tadipudi Lift Irrigation Project of Godavari
 yah pariyojna khaas myne rakhti he kyonki godavari kaa kareeb 3,000 tiemasi pani har saal bah kar bengal kii khadi main chalaa jaataa tha or kisi kaam nahin aata tha
