 Then Congress President Rahul Gandhi gave the idea of 'jan Ashirwad Yatra' to reach out to every section of Karnataka
 yatra ne netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich duuri ko paatane kaa bhi kaam kiya
 At the same time, the goal of reaching more and more people was also met to a great extent
 iske alaava ummidavaaron ko bhi apane vishisht campagne ke liye plateform mila

 kaaryakarta hi ‘king’rahul gandhi ne jab se adhyaksh ke taur par party kii kaman sanbhali he, unka sandesh saaf rahaa he- kaaryakarta hi ab king he
 During the campaign so far in Karnataka, Rahul interacted more and more with the activists and also connected them with the strategy of campaigning
 kai kaaryakartaaon ko party tikat bhi die gaye
 Tickets for 14 sitting mlas were cut
 vahiin rishtedaaron ke liye tikat maangane vaale congress netaaon ko bhi party alaakaman se thanda rispons mila
 Congress General Secretary Incharge KC Venugopal for Karnataka told India Today, 'rahul Gandhi's message to party workers is important
 karnataka ke liye tikat vitaran samuhik koshish kaa nateeja he or party cader ke liye bada protsaahan he

 kshetreey netritv ko mahatvagujrat kii tarah karnataka me bhi kshetreey netritv ko khaasaa mahatv diya gaya
 Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and on the advice of Siddaramaiah, all the leaders from the block-district to the state level were linked to the election process
 kai rajyon main party netritv main badlaav ke baad congress netaaon kaa kahana he kiraahul gandhihi chaahate hai ki party ke kendriya netaa or rajya str ke netaa kandhe se kandhaa mila kar saath chalem
 Apart from this, the party leaders and workers should also increase contact with people at the personal level
 sutron ke mutabik aage bhi jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai vahaan ke netaa bhi rahul ke yatra model ko dohraane ke bade icchhuk hai
 The priority behind giving priority to activists and regional faces is to give the same message that Rahul's Congress is different from the earlier Congress
 kehete hai ki duniya main log sari mehnat pet ke liye hi karte hai
 This story is also about the stomach
 par jaraa hatakar
 Distinctly because the stomach is placed at stake here for the stomach
 kalpana kiijie
 If you bump into someone who is walking in the stomach for fifty-hundred whole capsules, what would you call him? This story is similar to that of crores of rupees
 duniya kii nigahon se dur band kamare main ek shaks koi capsule jaisi cheez taiyaar karne main juta he
 One by one he fills some powder in small bags of plastic and rubber and then heats them in a candle flame and keeps them sealed
 ab capsule taiyaar ho chukaa he or unhen khaane kii baari he
 But for this, do not have to take the help of water or any drink, but instead of dipping the capsule in a special solution, take it straight out of the stirrer
 capsule banaakar unhen khaane yani halak ke neeche utaarne kii is harakat ko ab 24 ghante se bhi zyada kaa vakt guzar chukaa he, lekin uske pet kii andruni tasviir ab bhi thik waisi hi he jaisi unhen nigle jane ke turant baad thi
 That is, neither these capsules are dissolving in his stomach, nor is the medicine kept in it having any effect on that person
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki aakhir is shaks ne itane saare capsul se apana pet aakhir kyon bhar liya he? chori-chhipe capsule banane se lekar unhen is tarah pet main pahunchane kii ye kahani jitani rahasyamayi he, iske aage kii baat utani hi chaunkaane vaali
 Because there is neither any medicine in those capsules nor this person is doing his treatment
 sachai to ye he ki is tarah banaae gaye harek capsule main jehar bharaa he
 The question is, when a capsule burst can kill a person who swallows them, then why should this person one by one take ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or even more capsules in their stomach It is filling the poison
 Each capsules of poison is worth millions of rupees
 yani us ek shaks ke pet main karodon rupee bhare hue hai
 a intelligence-informed bureaucratic control bureau gets the news that a person is going to come to Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport with a very valuable item
 airport par jaal bichaaya jaataa he
 The person arrives and is also caught
 lekin tamaam talaashi ke baavjood uske paas se aisa kuch nahin miltaa
 Finally, assuming that the news was wrong, the officers decide to leave it
 lekin usase pehle wo use chaay-coffee or kuch khaane ko ofer karte hai
 He refuses and this is where the officers' ears stand
 darasal, use pani or coffee ke ofer ke peeche shishtachar kam or enasibi ke afasaron kii chaal zyada thi
 Such a trick that he has often tried to portray such swallowers
 aam taur par pet main cocaine yaa heroin jaise drug chhipaane vaale solbers inhen baahar nikaalane se pehle kuch bhi khaane pine se bachate hai
 It is the same with this person
 medical jaanch main saaf hota he ki afikri mul ke bobi kolins naam ke is shaks ne 65 capsule kii shakl main pet main kareeb saadhe chah karod rupee kii cocaine chipa rakhi he
 This is not the first time that someone came to Hindustan by hiding the intoxicating crores of rupees in his stomach
 isse pehle bhi kai videshiyon ko narkotics beuro range haathon pakad chukaa he
 Thankfully, this time there was no burst of hidden capsules in the stomach
 kai baar aisa bhi dekha gaya he ki hindustan pahunchane se pehle hi cocaine se bharaa capsule fat gaya or karier kii maut ho gai

 Addressing a huge youth rally in the city, Modi said, 'if i tell the truth, all the ministers of the UPA government are unhappy, they feel bad and get depressed
 ' He said, 'there is a reason for this

 They feel how a tea seller can challenge such a large sultanate who ruled in a country uninterrupted for many consecutive years
 ' Modi said that the Congress keeps looking for opportunities to target him

 If i do not get this opportunity in this birth, then in the next life i will come here to serve the people of the country
 ' On the policy of the UPA government for the youth in the country, Modi said that it is the responsibility of the people in power to think about the youth, provide them skill development training, provide them employment

 Although new cashless means of transactions (credit and debit cards, Apple Pay) have made inroads in Japan over the past few years, cash transactions have doubled over the last 20 years
 japan ke kendriya bank ke aankade kehete hai ki is saal oktober tak vahaan arthvyavastha main 101 trillian yen cash main maujuud tha
 At the same time, cash accounted for 80% of the total transactions in Japan as of 2014
 card bhi he lekin cash ij kingis cash vyavastha main aisa nahin he ki plastic mani yaa cashles card maujuud nahin he
 Japan first used a credit card in 1960 when the Maruti department store issued the card to customers for purchase
 aaj japan main lagbhag 32 karod aise credit card maujuud hai, yani prati vyask teen credit card
 According to the international plastic money company mastercard, more than 38 percent of transactions in Japan are still in cash
 yah france main cash tranjaction kaa paanch guna he
 At the same time, cash transactions are 20 percent in the US and only 11 percent in England
 aakhir kyon japan main 'cash ij king'cash ke prachlan ke peeche sabase bada tark diya jaataa he ki yah sabase surakshit madhyam he
 Theft, snatching and robbery in Japan is almost non-existent
 log yahaan apni jeb yaa bag main dheron cash lekar chalane main darate nahin hai
 Alam is that if your purse filled with money falls somewhere, just wait, someone will send it to your address soon and in case there is no address or ID in the purse, it will be found at the nearest police station
 chote dukandaaron kii majaburi he cashcash kaa doosraa mahatv deshbhar main maujuud chote kiraanaa store or khaane-pine kii dukaanon ke kaaran he
 These small and medium shopkeepers are unable to prepare the terms of fees on transactions through credit and debit cards issued by banks, so they completely discard these mediums
 iske alaava aise dukandaaron ko doosraa bada phayda inakam tex main bachat ke rup main miltaa he kyonki aamtaur par vah prati varsh kaarobaar main ghate kaa ritern bharte hai
 But their number is so large that the government shies away from imposing income tax
 atm technology main sabase aage japantechnology ke maamle main japan duniya kaa agrani desh he
 The threat of technology can be clearly seen in all the big cities of Japan
 isi kaa nateeja he ki japan kii rajdhani samet desh ke bade shaharon main maujuud bainkon kii atm mashine cash dene ke saath-saath note or sikkon kaa aadan pradaan bhi karte hai
 If you want to pay money to a shopkeeper, it is natural that he will expect cash, and all you have is a debit or credit card
 to pareshaani kii baat nahin he kyonki aap apane card se kisi atm se note or sikke nikaal sakate hai
 If you have the money only in the note, you can get the coins for free from the ATM
 iske alaavasikkon ke evaj main zyaadaatar atm mashin aapako note bhi pradaan kar degi or yah sabhi vyavastha muft he kyonki japan main cash ij king
 Now you can tell me that when Japan can run its hundreds of years old economy without changing, then did Prime Minister Modi not have to learn this skill on his immediate visit to Japan after the decision of demonetisation
 japan ke shaharon kii tarah bharat ke shahar bhi america or europe ho chuke hai
 However, as soon as the real Japan starts out of the cities, the real India starts in the villages outside the cities of India
 modi ji kya vaaki jaruri tha ki hajaaron saal puraani gaanvon kii note or sikkon vaali vishwaas kii arthvyavastha ko khatm kar credit or debit vaali udhaar kii vyavastha ko lagu karnaa? The new additional premises of the Supreme Court was inaugurated on Wednesday

 mumbai ke king edward medical aspataal main 42 saal se bistar par besudh padi aruna shanbagh kii saanson kii door akhirkaar somvaar ko tut gai
 The Aruna Shanbag case suddenly drew attention to some basic questions related to life and justice 4 years ago, when the court for his compassionate plea was rejected by the court
 tab jis tark ne aruna shanbagh kii raksha kii thi, uske mutabik jivan pavithratam or amuly he
 In any case, Aruna Shanbag lived for a long time, and at least in this case, fortunate, in this world of relentless concern and anguish, she found some nurses who were willing to serve her in their beggars
 She continued, returning the dignity of her life to him
 aruna shanbagh kaa maamla tab sarvocch nyaayalay ke saamne aayaa jab aruna ke jivan par kitaab likh rahi ek lekhika pinki viraani ne ek yachika daayar kar unke liye karunamrityu kii maang kii
 After all, what was the pressure under which Pinki Virani did this work? Pinki Virani had mentioned in her petition that Aruna Shanbag is living a life in which she is left with nothing to feel and express
 unhen jivit rakhana antat ek jivan virdohi yaa manushya virdohi praytn he, kyonki jivan kii sarthakata tab he jab use mahasoos or vyakt kiya ja sake
 In a way, the Supreme Court was sympathetic to Aruna Shanbag's argument
 apane aitihaasik faisale main usne paroksh karunamrityu kii ijazat di thi
 Indirect Karunamruti means that a patient is removed from his life-saving system, those formulas should be cut which save his life under any circumstances
 yani kisi marij ko karunamrityu dene ke liye koi dawa yaa sooyee nahin di ja sakati yaa koi aisa sakriy prayaas nahin kiya ja saktaa, jisase uskaa jivan chalaa jaae
 Yes, if you give up trying to save her, then it is indirect compassion
 haalanki kisi ko aisi karunamrityu dene kaa faisalaa bhi ucch nyaayalay ke kam se kam do nyaayadhishon ke khandpeeth kii manjuuri ke bina nahin ho saktaa or is khandpeeth ko bhi kam se kam teen doctoron ke panel se isaki ijazat leni padi hogi
 That is, the court has tried to completely eliminate the fear that the law related to indirect desire death can not be misused
 lekin kya hamaare samaaj main ab bhi aisi paroksh ichha mrityu kaa chalan jari nahin he? jab koi doctor kisi bujurg or biimaar marij ke liye yah yukti sujhata he ki ab unka koi ilaaj nahin rahaa or unhen ghar hi le janaa chahie to yah ek tarah se paroksh ichhamrityu kaa hi faisla he jis par ab tak kisi kanoon ke abhaav main na ungali uthati thi, na mukadmaa hota tha
 It is difficult to say now, what will happen in the new situation
 baharhaal, supreme court ne aruna shanbagh ko phir bhi jeene kii ijazat kyon di thi? is sawaal kaa jawaab hamen kai upyogi nishkarshon tak pahunchaa saktaa he
 Even if Aruna Shanbaug was exempted from this destiny by the court, while declaring Indirect Karunamrutya as valid in some circumstances, it was a small community willing to try and defend her life to save her life
 yani ek str par ham kah sakate hai ki jivan kii raksha main samuhikta or sarokaar kaa bada yogadan hota he
 The nurses at King Edward College Hospital in Mumbai displayed this collectiveness, showing concern, so the court was also shown with so much dignity in Aruna Shanbag's otherwise wasted life that she considered them worth living
 yah alag baat he ki aruna shanbagh kii paristhitiyon main jo samvedansheeltaa, jo sarokaarasampannataa adaalat ne dekh lee, vah ek or samvedansheel mahila pinki viraani ko nazar nahin ai
 Probably because Pinky Virani was seeing Aruna Shanbag's life limited to Aruna Shanbag only
 vah yah nahin samaj paa rahi thim ki ek jivan main kitne jivan shaamil hote hai, ek maut se kitne rishte tuutate hai
 This truth of collectivity has a great significance in Indian contexts
 is vishaal desh main saamaajikta ke taar saare dabaavon ke baavjood ab tak itane bache hue hai ki ham dusron ke jivan kii parvaah karte hai- bhale unase hamaara koi khun kaa rishta na ho
 Perhaps this is the thing that has kept this society safe even in the midst of many deprivations, many inertia
 lekin ab yah sambandh khatare main he,kyonki yah samaaj khatare main he
 In the recent times between the breakdown of villages and the rot of cities, this collectivity has been damaged on many levels and a man facing the curse of displacement and loneliness is also forced to see suicide as an option
 yah anayas nahin he ki karunamrityu par apane faisle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne aatmahatya se jude kanoon kaa bhi zikr kiya tha or ise aparaadh na maanane kii vakaalat kii he
 By the way, we do not have a second and important point in this matter of Aruna Shanbag
 42 saal pehle aruna ek pashavik vyavhaar kii shikaar huin
 This behavior pushed her mentally towards a permanent disability, which she could not recover till her last time
 tab vah 22 saal kii ladki thim, ab kareeb 65 saal kii umr main unka dehanth hua he
 The 42 years in between have been reduced to his body only, he had no impression on his mind
 udhar, jis ward bvoy ne unhen chen se jakad kar unke saath dushkarm kiya tha, usne apane hisse kii sajaa kaat lee
 It is said that he continued to work in a hospital in Delhi after spending seven years in jail and died some time ago
 ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki usne apni sajaa kaat lee thi
 But would that person have been shaken or trembled by one night's grief? Or would it have become more audacious? baharhaal, uskaa jo bhi ho, aruna shanbagh ke liye uskaa jivan vah nahin rah gaya jo vah ho saktaa tha
 This entire episode shows that a crime is not just an accident with a body, its wounds also fall on the mind and go far and wide
 kisi aparaadh kii gambhirtha is baat se bhi tay hoti he ki uskaa kisi peedit par kya asar padaa
 Unfortunately, it does not appear that this would have been taken care of during the ongoing trial on Aruna Shanbag
 ek routine adalati karrwai se ek routine kism kii sazaa nikali or ek shaks kii zindagi ko maut se bhi badtar bana dene vaala shaks kuch saal kii sajaa kaat kar bari ho gaya
 The biggest lesson in the life of Aruna Shanbag is that if a person can make someone's life meaningless, it can give some people the dignity to live with him
 aruna shanbagh kaa jivan unke liye bhale ahmiyat na rakhata rahaa ho, lekin vah bahut saare logon ke liye- king edward college kii un nurson ke liye, jinhone 42 saal tak unhen bachaae rakhaa - myne rakhata tha
 She may have survived 42 years in this situation even if she was cared for in this way
 yahaan ek sandesh hamaare liye bhi he- karunamrityu kaa kanoon bhale ban gaya ho, lekin jivan ko ham is kanoon se bada maane or yah samajhen ki dusron ke jivan main- sarokaar or smriti ke str par hi sahi- hamaara bhi bahut kuch shaamil he
 Aruna Shanbag's case came before the Supreme Court when Pinki Virani, an author writing a book on Aruna's life, filed a petition demanding compassion for him
 aakhir yah koun-sa dabaav tha, jiske tahat pinki viraani ne yah kaam kiya? pinki viraani ne apni yachika main is baat kaa zikr kiya tha ki aruna shanbagh ek aisa jivan ji rahi hai, jisamen vah kuch bhi mahasoos or vyakt karne laayak nahin bachi hai
 To keep them alive is ultimately an anti-life or anti-human effort, because the meaning of life is when it can be felt and expressed
 ek tarah se dekhen to sarvocch nyaayalay ne aruna shanbagh ke tark se sahanubhuti dikhaai thi
 In his historical decision, he allowed indirect compassion
 paroksh karunamrityu kaa matlab yah hua ki kisi marij ko uski jivan rakshak pranali se dur kar diya jaae, ve sutara kaat die jaaen jo uske jivan ko kisi bhi paristhiti main bachaate hon
 That is, no medicine or needle can be given to a patient to pay compassionate or any active effort that can lead to his life
 haa, use bachaane kaa prayaas chhod dene se uski jaan chali jaae to yah paroksh karunamrityu he
 However, the decision to award such compassion to one cannot be done without the approval of the bench of at least two judges of the High Court and this bench would also have to take permission from a panel of at least three doctors
 yani adaalat ne apni taraf se yah andeshaa puri tarah khatm karne kii koshish kii he ki paroksh ichha mrityu se jude kanoon kaa koi durupyog na ho sake
 But is there still no such ongoing trend of death in our society? When a doctor suggests this tactic for an elderly and sick patient that they are no longer treated and they should be taken home, it is a decision of indirect euthanasia in the absence of any law so far
 She used to get up, there was no lawsuit
 ab kahana mushkil he, nae halaat main kya hoga
 However, why did the Supreme Court allow Aruna Shanbag to live still? The answer to this question can lead us to many useful conclusions
 adaalat ne paroksh karunamrityu ko kuch paristhitiyon main vaid bataate hue bhi agar aruna shanbagh ko is niyati se mukt rakhaa to bas isliye ki unka jivan chaahane vaali, use bachaae rakhane ke liye praytn karne or mukadmaa ladane ko taiyaar ek choti-si birdari thi
 That is, at one level we can say that collectivity and concern have a big contribution in protecting life
 mumbai ke king edward college aspataal kii nurson ne yah samuhikta dikhaai, yah sarokaar pradarshit kiya, isliye adaalat ko bhi aruna shanbagh ke anyathaa vyarth ho chuke jivan main itani garima dikhi ki usne unhen jeene laayak mana
 It is another matter that the sensitiveness in the circumstances of Aruna Shanbag, which was seen by the court of concern, was not seen by another sensitive woman Pinki Virani
 shaayad isliye ki pinki viraani aruna shanbagh ke jivan ko sirf aruna shanbagh tak simit karke dekh rahi thim
 She could not understand how many lives are involved in a life, how many relationships are broken by one death
 bhartiya sandarbhon main samuhikta ke is satya kaa ek bada mahatva he
 Despite all the pressures of socialism in this vast country, we are still left so much that we care about the lives of others - even if we have no blood relation with them
 shaayad yahi chiz he jisane kai tarah ke abhaavon ke bich, kai tarah kii jadtaaon ke bich bhi is samaaj ko bachaae rakhaa he
 But now this relationship is in danger, because this society is in danger
 gaanvon kii tuutan or shaharon kii sadaandh ke bich haal ke dinon main yah samuhikta kai staron par kshatigrast hui he or visthaapan or akelepan ke abhishaap jhel rahaa aadmi aatmahatya ko bhi vikalp kii tarah dekhne ko majaboor he
 It is not uncommon that the Supreme Court, in its judgment on Karunamruti, also referred to the law related to suicide and advocated that it should not be considered a crime
 vaise, aruna shanbagh ke is maamle ke ek duusare or ahm sire par hamaari nigaah nahin he
 42 years ago, Aruna suffered a cruel behavior
 isi vyavhaar ne unhen maansik taur par ek aisi sthaayee aapangata kii taraf dhakel diya, jisase vah apane antim samay tak ubar nahin pai
 She was a 22-year-old girl, now she has died at the age of 65
 bich ke 42 varsh sirf unke jism par ghate hai, unke man par unki koi chhap nahin padi
 On the other hand, the ward boy who had raped him by holding him in chains, got his share of punishment
 bataaya jaataa he ki saat saal kii jail bhugat kar vah dilli ke kisi aspataal main naukari karata rahaa or kuch arsa pehle uski maut hui
 In a way it can be said that he had served his sentence
 lekin kya us shaks ko kabhi apni ek raat kii vahshat ne jhakzora yaa siharaaya hoga? yaa phir vah kahin zyada dussahsee ho gaya hoga?tippaniyan However, whatever he may be, for Aruna Shanbag his life is not what he could have been
 yah puraa prasang bataata he ki ek jurm sirf ek sharir ke saath ek haadasa nahin hota, uske zakhm man par bhi padate hai or bahut dur tak padate hai
 The severity of a crime is also determined by the impact it has on a victim
 durbhaagya se yah lagata nahin he ki aruna shanbagh par chal rahe mukademe ke vaqt is baat kaa khyal rakhaa gaya hoga
 a routine court action led to a routine sentence and a person who was sentenced to life imprisonment for a few years was sentenced to a few years' imprisonment
 aruna shanbagh ke jivan kaa sabase bada sabak yahi he ki ek vahshat agar kisi ke jivan ko vyarth bana sakati he to kuch logon kaa saath use phir bhi jeene kii garima de saktaa he
 Aruna Shanbag's life may not have mattered to her, but it mattered to many people - to the nurses at King Edward College who protected her for 42 years
 vah is haal main 42 saal bachi rah gayi to bhi shaayad isiilie ki unki is tarah dekhbhaal kii gai
 There is also a message for us here - even though the law of compassion has become a law, we should consider life larger than this law and understand that the lives of others - right on the level of concern and memory - also include our lot
 ek tarah se dekhen to sarvocch nyaayalay ne aruna shanbagh ke tark se sahanubhuti dikhaai thi
 In his historical decision, he allowed indirect compassion

 adaalat ne paroksh karunamrityu ko kuch paristhitiyon main vaid bataate hue bhi agar aruna shanbagh ko is niyati se mukt rakhaa to bas isliye ki unka jivan chaahane vaali, use bachaae rakhane ke liye praytn karne or mukadmaa ladane ko taiyaar ek choti-si birdari thi
 That is, at one level we can say that collectivity and concern have a big contribution in protecting life
 mumbai ke king edward college aspataal kii nurson ne yah samuhikta dikhaai, yah sarokaar pradarshit kiya, isliye adaalat ko bhi aruna shanbagh ke anyathaa vyarth ho chuke jivan main itani garima dikhi ki usne unhen jeene laayak mana
 It is another matter that the sensitiveness in the circumstances of Aruna Shanbag, which was seen by the court of concern, was not seen by another sensitive woman Pinki Virani
 shaayad isliye ki pinki viraani aruna shanbagh ke jivan ko sirf aruna shanbagh tak simit karke dekh rahi thim
 She could not understand how many lives are involved in a life, how many relationships are broken by one death
 bhartiya sandarbhon main samuhikta ke is satya kaa ek bada mahatva he
 Despite all the pressures of socialism in this vast country, we are still left so much that we care about the lives of others - even if we have no blood relation with them
 shaayad yahi chiz he jisane kai tarah ke abhaavon ke bich, kai tarah kii jadtaaon ke bich bhi is samaaj ko bachaae rakhaa he
 But now this relationship is in danger, because this society is in danger
 gaanvon kii tuutan or shaharon kii sadaandh ke bich haal ke dinon main yah samuhikta kai staron par kshatigrast hui he or visthaapan or akelepan ke abhishaap jhel rahaa aadmi aatmahatya ko bhi vikalp kii tarah dekhne ko majaboor he
 It is not uncommon that the Supreme Court, in its judgment on Karunamruti, also referred to the law related to suicide and advocated that it should not be considered a crime
 vaise, aruna shanbagh ke is maamle ke ek duusare or ahm sire par hamaari nigaah nahin he
 42 years ago, Aruna suffered a cruel behavior
 isi vyavhaar ne unhen maansik taur par ek aisi sthaayee aapangata kii taraf dhakel diya, jisase vah apane antim samay tak ubar nahin pai
 She was a 22-year-old girl, now she has died at the age of 65
 bich ke 42 varsh sirf unke jism par ghate hai, unke man par unki koi chhap nahin padi
 On the other hand, the ward boy who had raped him by holding him in chains, got his share of punishment
 bataaya jaataa he ki saat saal kii jail bhugat kar vah dilli ke kisi aspataal main naukari karata rahaa or kuch arsa pehle uski maut hui
 In a way it can be said that he had served his sentence
 lekin kya us shaks ko kabhi apni ek raat kii vahshat ne jhakzora yaa siharaaya hoga? yaa phir vah kahin zyada dussahsee ho gaya hoga?tippaniyan However, whatever he may be, for Aruna Shanbag his life is not what he could have been
 yah puraa prasang bataata he ki ek jurm sirf ek sharir ke saath ek haadasa nahin hota, uske zakhm man par bhi padate hai or bahut dur tak padate hai
 The severity of a crime is also determined by the impact it has on a victim
 durbhaagya se yah lagata nahin he ki aruna shanbagh par chal rahe mukademe ke vaqt is baat kaa khyal rakhaa gaya hoga
 a routine court action led to a routine sentence and a person who was sentenced to life imprisonment for a few years was sentenced to a few years' imprisonment
 aruna shanbagh ke jivan kaa sabase bada sabak yahi he ki ek vahshat agar kisi ke jivan ko vyarth bana sakati he to kuch logon kaa saath use phir bhi jeene kii garima de saktaa he
 Aruna Shanbag's life may not have mattered to her, but it mattered to many people - to the nurses at King Edward College who protected her for 42 years
 vah is haal main 42 saal bachi rah gayi to bhi shaayad isiilie ki unki is tarah dekhbhaal kii gai
 There is also a message for us here - even though the law of compassion has become a law, we should consider life larger than this law and understand that the lives of others - right on the level of concern and memory - also include our lot

 baharhaal, uskaa jo bhi ho, aruna shanbagh ke liye uskaa jivan vah nahin rah gaya jo vah ho saktaa tha
 This entire episode shows that a crime is not just an accident with a body, its wounds also fall on the mind and go far and wide
 kisi aparaadh kii gambhirtha is baat se bhi tay hoti he ki uskaa kisi peedit par kya asar padaa
 Unfortunately, it does not appear that this would have been taken care of during the ongoing trial on Aruna Shanbag
 ek routine adalati karrwai se ek routine kism kii sazaa nikali or ek shaks kii zindagi ko maut se bhi badtar bana dene vaala shaks kuch saal kii sajaa kaat kar bari ho gaya
 The biggest lesson in the life of Aruna Shanbag is that if a person can make someone's life meaningless, it can give some people the dignity to live with him
 aruna shanbagh kaa jivan unke liye bhale ahmiyat na rakhata rahaa ho, lekin vah bahut saare logon ke liye- king edward college kii un nurson ke liye, jinhone 42 saal tak unhen bachaae rakhaa - myne rakhata tha
 She may have survived 42 years in this situation even if she was cared for in this way

 At the same time, Kim has taken a friendship initiative, leaving American citizens imprisoned in North Korea
 saal 2018 main ek ke baad kim apane kirdaar se ulat nayaa itihaas rachataa ja rahaa he
 In this one year, Kim has done so many things that he has not done in the last years of his rule
 pigal rahi he rishton par jami barfwinter olympix ke dauraan uttar korea or dakshin korea ke bich rishton kii barf pighali he
 Simultaneously, Kim Jong Un has given up his insistence on making atomic bombs
 isi dauraan kim train se china kii yatra par gaye
 By doing this, for the first time in 70 years, North Korea has created a new history
 or in sabake baad ab kim or trump kii mulaakaat hone ja rahi he
 The year 2017, the ruler of North Korea, Kim Jong Un had said - i have a button on my table, i will press anytime
 to uske jawaab main america raashtrapati - donald trump ne kaha tha- mere paas tumse bhi bada batan he or ye kaam bhi karata he
 The year 2018, now Kim Jong Un says - if America promises to end the war, then we need to live in trouble by keeping our nuclear weapons? On the other hand, US President Donald Trump is saying - He (kim Jong Un) is quite open and from what we are seeing, he seems to be a highly respected person

 However, it will now be decided by the Mahamilan which is to be held in the first week of June

 Then, forgetting the 70-year-old rivalry, he sets foot on South Korean soil and then takes a plane trip to China again

 lekin trump ne uski mushkil aasaan kar di or mulaakaat ke liye jagah tay kar di
 The whole world is watching the meeting, the whole world is eyeing every movement before this meeting
 kyonki trump or kim kii mulaakaat agar khushnuma maahaul main hui to thik varanaa phir se vishwayuddh kaa khatra mandaraane lagegaa
 We are not scaring you but are warning you of the possibilities, because Trump himself has said that if there is no solution to the conversation, he will leave the meeting in the middle

 sarkaar ko bhi iskaa sammaan karte hue jald se jald jaaton kii aarakshan kii maang puri kar andolan khatm karana chahie
 Malik said that in Uttar Pradesh, the Jat agitators had vacated the railway tracks in honor of the Allahabad High Court's decision, but the government is trying to end the agitation by doing all kinds of tricks
 unhone kaha ki haryana ke jaaton ne faisla kiya he ki ve rail patariyaan khaali nahin karenge
 Malik said that respecting the decision of the Supreme Court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the government should end the agitation by fulfilling the demand for Jat reservation
 malik ne kaha ki jat shantipurna tareeke se dharna pradarshan kar rahe hai
 If their demand for reservation is not met, then from March 28, Delhi's connectivity will be cut off from the rest of the country
 unhone kaha ki nyaayalay ne sarkaar ko dilli ko aavashyak vastuon kii aapurti sunishchit karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Therefore, the government should not allow the supply of essential commodities to Delhi by providing reservation to the Jats
 jat netaa ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki nyaayalay ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah andolan samaapt karaaye
 He argued that the court had not given any direction to the agitators

 Famous lyricist Javed Akhtar has attacked Shekhar Kapur, an associate of Bollywood film industry, on Twitter on Sunday
 shekhar kapur ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount par likhaa ki unhen buddhijiviyon se dar tha, jo saanp kii tarah hote hai or unhen bharat main vibhaajan ke dashakon baad abhi bhi sharnaarthi jaisaa mahasoos hota he
 After this statement, lyricist Javed Akhtar took the news fiercely on Twitter
 unhone unke twit par jawaab dete hue latad lagaai
 Akhtar tweeted continuously three to four on Twitter
 unke alaava twitor yugers ne bhi film diarector shekhar kapur par bhadaas nikaali
 Started life as refugee of Partition
 Parents gave everything to make a life for kids
 Was always in fear of 'intellectuals'
 They made me feel insignicant
 Small
 Then suddenly embraced me after my films
 i still fear them
 Their embrace is like a bite of snake
 Still a refugee
 shekhar kapur ne apane twitor acount par likhaa, ''apane jivan kii shuruyaat bharat ke vibhaajan ke samay main ek sharnaarthi ke taur par kii thi
 The parents surrendered everything to make my life
 main ‘buddhijiviyon' se hameshaa darataa rahaa
 He always made me feel incomplete and small and when my film started playing, people started appreciating me there
 main aaj bhi buddhijiviyon se darataa hum
 Hugging intellectuals is like snake bites
 main aaj bhi ek sharnaarthi hum
 ''
 who are these intellectuals who embraced you and you found that embrace like a snake's bite ? Shyam Benegal , Adoor Gopal Krishna , Ram chandra Guha ? Really ? 
 Shekhar saheb you are not well
 You need help 
 Come on, there is no shame in meeting a good psychiatrist
 is twit ke baad geetkaar javed akhtar ne karaara jawaab dete hue likhaa, ''ye koun buddhijivi varg hai, jo aapako gale laga rahe hai or aap unase gale milakar saanp ke dasane jaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai? shyaam benegal, adur gopal krishna, ram chandra guha? kya sach main? shekhar sahab aap thik nahin lag rahe
 You need help chaliye, kisi achche manochikitsak se milane main mat sharmaaie
 '' What do you mean by still a refugee does it mean that you feel like an outsider n not an Indian n you don't feel that this is your motherland
 If in India you are still a refugee where will you not feel like a refugee ,in Pakistan? Cut this melodrama you poor rich but lonely guyjavexa akhtar ne thik duusare twit main likhaa, ''sharnaarthi kaa kya matlab he? kya aap aaj bhi bharat main ek bahari ke taur par rah rahe hai? kya aapako yah apni dharti nahin lagati? agar aap bharat main abhi bhi sharnaarthi he to aap sharnaarthi jaisaa kahaan mahasoos nahin karenge, pakistan main? amir garib kaa melodrama band kariye, lekin aap akele vyakti hai
 '' You introduce yourself as neither prejudiced by the past nor afraid of the future living in this moment and in the same breath you say you are a refugee of partition and still a refugee
 One doesn't need a magnifying glass to see the contradiction 
 Javed Akhtar also lashed out at Shekhar Kapoor through this tweet
 unhone likhaa- ''aapane apane aapako is tarah se pesh kiya he ki aapako na to ateet ke purvagrahon se koi matlab he or na hi bhavishya main kisi tarah se dare hue hai
 And you have been calling yourself a refugee since the time of partition and you still consider yourself a refugee
 aapke is virodhabhas ko koi bhi saamaanya rup se dekh saktaa he
 "no
 It means once you are a refugee, you feel a gypsy

 The Health Minister, himself a doctor, has written on his website that the so-called sex education should be banned

 Earlier, he had created a ruckus by making a statement that instead of promoting the use of condoms the government should insist on propagating Indian culture to overcome AIDS disease
 unhone kaha ki vah chahenge ki echivi-aids par kaabo paane ke liye 'pati-patni ke bich eemaandaar shaareerik sambandhon' ko badhaava diya jaae, jo 'bhartiya samskruti kaa hissaa he

 kitaab haive E47 kii lekhika archana panyuli hai
 This book has been published from Gyanaganga Prakashan, Delhi

 Archana Panuli is a storyteller closely capturing the irony that thrives between these aspects
 unka shumaar un chuninda kathakaron main hota he, jinhen stri vimarsh kii bhaawanaaon ko sadhaindaaj main bayaan karne kaa shaur he
 His latest story collection is a fresh testimony to the arguments made in his favor
 'haive E47' sheershak se chape unke is nae sangrah main 12 kahaniyon kaa guchha he
 Each story present in this bunch has its own distinct aroma, color and warmth of feeling
 sheershak kahani main us inasaani bhaavana kaa chithran he, jiskaa ehsaas or uski kasak tab tak mahasoos kar paanaa mushkil hoga jab tak un halaat se guzarana na hua ho
 This is the heart of the story of how a woman adapts herself from one environment to another while getting out of a simple life and getting entangled with worldly misdeeds
 'wo use kyon pasand karti he' vah kahani he, jisaki sthitiyon ko aksar apane irdagird ghatate hue dekha or is samvaad ko baar-baar uccharit hote suna ja saktaa he
 This story is taught in a different way to those who interfere with a very personal feeling like love
 'lakshmi' kaa kissa to shaayad ham sabhi apane aasapaas chalane vaali aawaara kism kii batakaiyon main dhundh sakate hai
 Combined with the combination of reality and emotion, this adaptation not only provides a support to the senses, but also shows the effort to prevent the unruly traitors from stumbling
 apni kokh main anginat kisse-kahaniyon ko panaah dene vaale mumbai ke badnaam mohalle kaa ek alag kissa he: 'godmadar'
 At the threshold of this story, a new world of human relationship begins to appear, which not only creates a scratch in the mind, but also gives a coating of hope
 is sangrah main panyuli ne jis tareeke se apane kirdaar chune or bune hai, usne kahaniyon ko behad dilachasp banaaya he or apane aasapaas kaa hone ke ehsaas se bhar diya he
 There is no lack of ideological openness in these stories

 com / l9aadcf1jm The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) cannot be left to God
 court ne kaha, 'sarkaar bhi maanati he ki jajon ki niyukti main colegium ke faisle se use aapatti ho aisi sthiti kam hi ai he
 'on behalf of the Central Government, Attorney General Mukul Rohtagine argued in the Constitution Bench that the manner in which the Ordinance 124 of the Constitution was understood
 usase samvidhan nirmaataa dow
 Ambedkar's soul will also be troubled, because there is no talk of collegium system anywhere in the constitution
 haalanki court kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko 100 main se 5 maamalon main hi aapatti hui he
 However, in the Constitution Bench hearing the case, Justice Chelameswar said that the government did not bring this new system because Dr
 ambedakar kii aatma pareshaan he, balki iske peeche kuch or kaaran he
 Rohatgi said that the independence of the judiciary starts only after the appointment of judges and in the new system, judges are the main ones
 agar teen main se do jaj kisi vyakti kii niyukti par sawaal uthaate hai to uski niyukti nahin ho sakati
 The petitioner's statement that this system will disturb the independence of the judiciary is not correct in any way
 unhone kaha ki 1993 kaa colegium system us vakt kii sarkaar ke ravaie kii vajah se bana, kyonki us vakt sarkaar ne nyaaypalika ko bhi gherne kii koshish kii thi
 This hearing will continue
 is maamle main samvidhan peeth pehle bhi centre sarkaar par kai sawaal uthaa chuki he
 Earlier, the court had asked the government to explain how the new system is better than the collegium system and this will not disturb the independence of the judiciary
 agar sarkaar court ko santusht kar detii he, to court is system ko maan legi
 The central government had earlier argued that in 1993, a nine-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court created the collegium system
 lihaaja is maamle ko bhi 9 yaa 11 jajon kii bench ko bheja janaa chahie, lekin court ne is maang ko thukraa diya tha
 In the meeting, CPCB officials said that in addition to Delhi, measures taken to improve the situation in the last one month in the four cities of NCR, Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurugram are proving to be inadequate

 The office of the Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on Wednesday said in the Supreme Court that the right of resignation of an MLA is a 'democratic right' and that it is high time that the judiciary sets the guidelines for the speakers
 spikar kii ore se pesh solicytor general tushaar mehta ne vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane ke pehle ke spikar ke faisle kaa virodh kiya
 He said that the legislator has the democratic right to resign
 vidhayakon kii nishtha nirvaachak ke liye he
 The then speaker did not give seven days notice to the mlas before disqualification
 karnataka vidhansabha adhyaksh ke karyaalay kii ore se solicytor general tushaar mehta ne nyaayamurti envi raman kii adhyakshata vaali teen nyaayadhishon kii peeth se kaha ki kisi raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta chhodane par kisi vidhayak ko ayogy qaraar diya ja saktaa he lekin sadan kii sadsyta chhodane par use ayogy qaraar nahin diya ja saktaa
 Mehta made this argument when the bench was hearing the petitions of 17 disqualified mlas from Karnataka
 vidhayakon ne unhen ayogy qaraar dene ke purv vidhansabha adhyaksh ke aar ramesh kumaar ke faisle ko chunauti di thi
 The bench also consists of Justice Sanjeev Khanna and Justice Krishna Murari
 mehta ne peeth se kaha, ‘‘yah sambhavat: baar-baar ho saktaa he or in 17 logon ke baad bhi is tarah ke maamle saamne aa sakate hai
 The same court has considered the right of resignation in the decision of a constitution bench
 '' unhone kaha ki istipha dena loktantric adhikaar he kyonki log matadaata ke paas waapas janaa chaahate hai
 Mehta said, "I cannot criticize what happened in this case in the past but it can happen again and again and there should be a decision on this issue
" yah sahi samay he ki nyaaypalika spikar ke liye dishanirdesh tay kare
 However, the bench said that the courts cannot set guidelines for the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham spikar ke liye dishanirdesh kaise tay kar sakate hai? vah ek sanvaidhanik pad he
 "the bench said," We cannot interfere in their jurisdiction
 '' sheersh adaalat ke samvidhan peeth ke ek faisle kaa zikr karte hue solicytor general ne kaha ki agar koi vidhayak apni party ke vichaaron se sahamat nahin he or sadan kii sadsyta se istipha de detaa he to vah naye sire se janadesh maangane ke liye matadaataaon ke bich ja saktaa he
 He said it was "factually incorrect" to give these 17 petitioners three days' notice by the then Speaker of Karnataka to respond to the disqualification motion
 mehta ne kaha ki vidhayak ke rup main raajnneetik dal badalanaa to dalbadal (defections) he lekin pehle sadan kii sadsyta se istipha dena or phir duusari party main jane ko dalbadal (defections) nahin kaha ja saktaa
 (also from input language) kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se jasusi mudde par istife kii maang karne kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota, kyonki na to unamem shame he or na naitikta hi
 Tiwari was responding to questions related to politics at a press conference ahead of the inauguration ceremony of the Indian International Film Festival (IFFI) in Panaji
 unase poocha gaya ki vivaadaaspad tepon ke saamne aane ke baad kya modi ko istipha de dena chahie, tiwari ne kaha, 'istife kii maang unase kii jaati he, jinke paas naitikta hoti he
 If he had any shame, he would have resigned only after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 yah sharmnaak he
 It is noteworthy that the image of Modi and his close aide Amit Shah has come under suspicion from tapes released in the media last week
 tepon se khulaasa hua he ki rajya sarkaar ne ek mahila ko kathith rup se nigaraanee ke daayre main rakhaa tha
 The tapes also reveal that the state's anti-terrorism police were allegedly following him

 # semifinals # indvsnz In order to demolish the strategy of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, the BJP has prepared to send Jagdish Mukhi to Parliament through Rajya Sabha
 sutron ke mutabik, party agle saal unhen rajyasabha chunaav kaa tikat de sakati he
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party was promoting Jagdish Mukhi as bjp's chief ministerial face and wanted to convert Delhi's Dangal Komukhi vs Arvind Kejriwal

 a highly placed source of the party said, 'jagdish Mukhi will be given the party ticket for Rajya Sabha election
 agle saal unhen vidhansabha se rajyasabha bheja jayega
 'obviously, the BJP does not want to turn this fight into Kejriwal vs Mukhi and now the BJP CM candidate in Delhi will be someone else
 gauratlab he ki bijepi 70 saal se zyada kii umr ke varisht netaaon ko chunaav ladvane se bachanaa chaahati he
 This decision has been made to counter the strategies of the common man party

 ' pichhali baar bijepi dilli main sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi, lekin aap ke ubhaar ne bahumat lene kii uski ummiido par pani pher diya tha
 The party does not want to leave any stone unturned this time
 amit shah ne bhi sabhi bijepi saansadon ko dilli main baithken karne or chunaav ke kaam main haath bantane kaa kaam diya he
 Senior union leaders told 'mail Today' that the BJP will also seek help from its student wing ABVP
 yuva netaaon ko chunaav or sanghathan donon jagah badi jimmedaari di jaaegi
 The party is looking for young faces with good hold in their areas

 narendra modi kii cabinet main rajasthan se iklauta cheharaa bane nihalchand meghavaal ko usee vakt aane vaali mushkilon kaa ehsaas ho gaya tha, jab rajya ke 25 saansadon main se sirf unhen shapath lene kaa nyotaa mila tha
 Happened according to his estimation
 mantri pad kii shapath lene ke chand ghanton ke bheetar hi aisa maamla saamne aa gaya jise rajya kii pichhali congress sarkaar ke samay hi police kii jaanch main managasaint paaya gaya or usee aadhaar par nichali adaalat ne cese band kar diya tha
 Actually the case is of October 2011
 haryana ke sirsa ke dabwaali kii ek mahila ne nihalchand samet 17 logon par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaate hue exiar darj karai thi
 a year later, the police filed a closure report
 iske baad trial court or jila court ne bhi mahila kii yachika khaarij kar di
 But after Nihalchand became Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, the aggrieved woman filed a review petition to reopen the case
 is par adaalat ne duusare paksh ko notice jari kar poocha ki kyon na is maamle ko phir se kholaa jaae
 Following this notice, the opposition immediately started demanding Nihalchand's removal from the Council of Ministers
 nihalchand is maamle par tippanee se parhez kar rahe hai
 According to sources, last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called Nihalchand and instructed him not to hold any talks in the media on the dispute
 par bijepi kii chintaa modi sarkaar kii chhavi par uth rahe sawaal hai
 It is also difficult that the internal investigation of the party found no evidence against Nihal
 alabatta party ko mili jaankaree main yah congress or duusare rajnatik pratidwandviyon ke alaava bijepi ke bhi kuch netaaon kaa shadyantr he
 Speaking to India Today, Captain Singh Solanki, in-charge of Rajasthan BJP, says, “the whole case is false
 party ke paas maujuud tathyon ke aadhaar par nihaal ko mantriparishad se hataanaa anyaay hoga
 We knew about this case even when given a Lok Sabha ticket and made a minister in the Modi government
 nihaal ke mantri banane ke baad unke rajnatik virodhiyon ne sajeesh ke tahat mahila se yah kaam karavaaya he
 "but who is the antagonist?" He says, "this is the work of the Congress, but the conspirators can be associated with any party
" ”bijepi se bhi? “kisi bhi party ke ho sakate hai
 i will not name but you can understand the meaning of my comment
 ” solanki to aarope lagane vaali mahila par hi yah kah kar sawaal khadaa kar dete hai ki usne apane pati par bhi balaatkaar kaa aarope laga diya
 Not only this, the woman is seen saying in a sting that her allegations on Nihalchand in this case are false
 lekin peedit mahila kaa aarope he ki nihalchand kii ore se us par cese waapas lene ke liye dhamkee or naukari kaa laalach diya ja rahaa he
 BJP leaders also argue that any victim demands punishment for the culprit but this woman is constantly demanding Nihal's removal from the Council of Ministers so that her political intent can be understood
 bijepi tathyon ke aadhaar par apane yuva mantri ke saath khadi he or court ke rukh kaa intjaar karnaa chaahati he
 But the party has a difficult budget session in Parliament where it may face a confrontation with the opposition on this issue
 duusari taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi apni sarkaar kii chhavi ke prati behad sajag hai isliye bijepi kaa ek dhada yah sambhaavna jataa rahaa he ki mushkil badi to sambhav he ki nihaal ko philhal mantri pad se dur rakhaa jaae
 However, instead of coming under any pressure, the party is standing behind Nihalchand like a rock
 lekin uski badi chintaa andruni shadyantr he

 sarkaar sona par aayaat duty ghataane kii taiyaari kar rahi he, jiskaa sidhaa asar yah hoga ki iskaa bhav neeche aa jayega
 Gold prices may decrease this month
 darasal, chaalu bajet ghate ko niyantrit karne ke liye sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaae the, jinamein ek tha sone ke aayaat par duty badhanaa
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram believed that the indiscriminate import of gold has a bad impact on the economy and needs to be stopped
 unhone sone ke emport par duty or badha di
 As a result, a total import duty of 10 percent was levied on gold
 do saal pehle is par sirf 2 pratishat duty thi
 As a result, gold became very expensive in India and its smuggling started
 bharat sone kaa duniya kaa sabase bada kharidaar desh he, lekin yahaan sone kaa utpaadan nahin ke baraabar hota he, isliye yahaan sone kaa sabase zyada emport hota he
 Last year, India imported around 700 tonnes of gold
 is par desh ko 88 arab dollar kharch karne pade the
 In May this year alone, it imported a record of 182 tonnes of gold
 isse dollar par bahut jor padaa
 He climbed up further
 emport badhane se or export jahaan ke tahaan rahane se chaalu bajet ghaataa (siedi) bad gaya
 The government took strong measures to curb this, which increased the duty and curbed its supply
 lekin iskaa bura asar hua or na keval sone kii smagaling shuru ho gai, balki aabhushanon ke niryaat ko bhi dhakka laga
 India is a major exporter of jewelery
 iskaa sone ke kaarobaar main lagi companiyon par bada bura asar padaa he or ve is samay sarkaar se behad naaraaz hai
 His lobby is currently active
 bade jeweler arabon dollar ke sone ke aabhushan niryaat karte hai
 The problem has arisen in front of them
 ab chaalu bajet ghaataa bhi kam ho gaya he
 It has now reached a satisfactory level
 duusari ore dollar bhi rupye ke mukaable 10 pratishat sasta ho gaya he
 Import of gold has also reduced significantly
 july main to maatr 47
 5 tonnes of gold were imported, whereas in August, more than 10 tonnes of gold was not imported 
 sabase badi baat he ki bazaar main sone kaa stock bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the government wants to reduce the control on gold, although in some circles, there is also talk of continuing the strictness, but it seems that the government can reduce the import duty by 2 percent and its decision in the Lok Sabha session May be after finishing

 He has expressed his views on every issue

 In recent times, the impact of the ongoing political struggle on the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Home Minister of the country, is also visible on Advani's blog
 kai maukon par vah jawahar laal nehru ko patel kaa virdohi darshane kii koshish karte hai
 In order to give authenticity to his talk, he refers to the essential portions of books written by the then bureaucrats and historians
 vaise patel par adwani kaa likhnaa isliye bhi ahm he ki bijepi ne unhen louh purush kii sangya di thi jiskaa istemaal multah desh ke pehle grahamantri ke liye hota he, or aajkal narendra modi bhi kuch aisi hi chhavi banane main jute hai
 In an interesting story-blog titled 'amazing writer-inspiring Book', Advani wrote, "president Zail Singh underwent an operation in the same hospital in which his predecessor Sanjeeva Reddy was

 ) Advani ji has taken this incident from the book 'humer is Lathil Vaipan'
 'adwani ne 'bhaajapa or easter sande' sheershak blog main apni party ke janm ke bare main likhaa he
 He has also mentioned this development in his autobiography
 adwani likhte hai, 'jansangh ke ham sabhi sadasyon ko janata party se nishkasana kaa faisla badi raahat lekar aayaa

 jahaan unke samakalinon ke liye inamen yaadgaar kahaniyaan to aaj ke yuva ke liye wo gyaan he jo unki soch va samaj ko or paripakv karne kaa kaam karte hai

 The tailpiece is a funny anecdote part of the blog

 For example, by reading the blog 'BJP and Easter Sunday', the superficial reasons and perspective of the formation of BJP can be understood

 Whatever be the party line, Advani has put forth his side with clarity every time, which also led to controversies
