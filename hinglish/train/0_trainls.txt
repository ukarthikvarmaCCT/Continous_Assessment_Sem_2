 'RAW' movie review: The story of RAW- Romeo Akbar Walter is during 1971, when India was at war between Pakistan
 maidan ke jang main ladane vaale deshbhakton ke alaava kuch aise bhi log hote hai jo gumnaam hote hai lekin unki qurbaani kam nahin hoti
 'RAW' is one such film which depicts the story of a detective who has to execute a mission
 jon abraham (john Abraham) ne jasoos ke is kirdaar ko nibhaayaa he
 But the fun becomes gritty because of the thrill and the drawn-out story
 RAW kii kahani banker jon abraham (john Abraham) kii he
 Which is overseen by Jackie Shroff, Chief of the Intelligence Department and he selects him for an under-cover mission
 romeo ek nai pahchaan hasil karata he or pakistan main apane mishan par nikal jaataa he
 In this way Romeo gets involved in his mission, but what happens to his fate will be known only after watching the film
 jon abraham or jasoos kii jindagi par aadhaarit film hone kii vajah se isamen koi masala ection hoga, iske bare main sochakar janaa badi galati hogi
 The treatment of the film spoils the taste even if the storyline is good
 diarector robi greval apane idia ko parade par utaarne main safal nahin rahe hai
 The film's moves are slow and the story also weakens on several occasions
 jon abraham kaa focus in dinon deshbhakti kii filmon par he, or ve romeo akbar walter ke kirdaar jame hai or ise kirdaar main utarane kii unhone puri koshish kii he
 Jackie Shroff is also well known as the head of the Intelligence Department
 sikandar kher ne acchhee acting kii he
 Mouni Roy is also in the film but the advice to Mouni is that he should think about his strong role rather than big films
 deshbhakti kii filmon ke is daur main RAW achchhavishay lekar to aati he lekin kamjor diarection or khinchi hui kahani kii vajah se film patari se utar jaati he
 Anyway, we have seen a great film like 'raazi', there were high expectations from 'RAW', but the film does not meet that criterion

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav nenoida-agra pravesh niyantrit express-ve ko lakhanu tak badhaane kii aavashyaktaa bataate hue kaha ki isse sambandhit kshetra ke kisaanon evam janata ko bhi laabh mil sakegaa
 The Chief Minister said after seeing the presentation based on the agra-lucknow Entrance Controlled Expressway Green Field Project in his meeting hall at Shastri Bhawan here that his government is in favor of constructing roads with high quality and facilities for the prosperity of the state and Noida Agra entry controlled expressway should be extended to Lucknow
 unhone agra se lakhanu tak prastaavit express-ve main paryaapt under-ve tathaa kaital-ve kii vyavastha karne ke nirdesh dete hue kaha ki donon taraf sarvice len kaa bhi nirmaan karaayaa janaa chahie
 Akhilesh said that apart from the development of mandis in the areas where the agra-lucknow express-way will pass, there will be an opportunity to take the produce of farmers to larger markets

 He said that Glass City can also be established in Firozabad with the construction of this expressway

 india today or aaj tak ke managing editor rahul kanwal kii ore se karnataka main ek hafte tak campagne ko cover karne ke baad nikaale gaye 10 nishkarsh-sthaneey jaankaron ko hameshaa rajya main har seat ke samikarnon kii kahin zyada gahari samaj hoti he
 But after spending hours with the important warriors of all the three parties who came out in the electoral battle, and after speaking to the voters of the regions we traveled to, i have drawn 10 important conclusions about the election of Karnataka's thorn
 1
 Corruption was more on the ground than on television, many hours were spent in the prime time TV talk shows on the debate on the political restoration of the Reddy brothers and how the anti-corruption rant of the BJP came to light when the party gave the balloons of Bellary's tainted Iron Mafia
 Awarded tickets bijepi apni muhim ke tahat siddharmaiya sarkaar par hamalaa kar rahi he, ise 10% sarkaar kaa naam dekar bula rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi also targeted the Chief Minister by calling him 'sidhi-rupaiya'
 dukhi karne vaali hakeekat ye he ki matadaata donon partiyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko zyada tavajjo nahin de rahe hai
 The Bellary brothers seem to have a strong hold in the three districts around Bellary and it is very likely that a large proportion of the 22 seats in these districts should go to the BJP fold
 congress ne bhi mining mafia se jude logon ko tikat die hai
 In such a situation, even the Congress cannot claim to be on the high ground of morality on the issue of corruption
 donon partiyon ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki intervyuu or press conference main kuch mushkil or asahaj sawaalon kaa jawaab dena kahin behatar he bajaae iske ki naitikta ke paath ke chakkar main siton ko ganvaa diya jaae
 The Prime Minister attacked leaders who started with mopeds and now move from luxury to luxury cars and live in luxurious houses
 aise netaa rajya main sabhi partiyon main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Karnataka is second only to Andhra Pradesh after Andhra Pradesh on behalf of politicians
 abhaage matadaata ne khud ko bhagya ke haal par chhod diya lagata he or uski dilchaspee is baat main zyada he ki koun sa netaa uski adhik madad kar saktaa he
 2
 nahin chal paa rahaa lingayat kaa daanvis chunaav main charchaa ke ahm muddon main mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii ore se lingayat card chalanaa bhi rahaa
 Under this, the Chief Minister offered to give minority status to 17% Lingayat community of the state
 mukhyamantri kii ore se aisa elaan karte hi kayaas lagaae jane lage ki kya lingayat vot congress kii ore mudega
 On the ground, nothing like this happens
 haa, un kuch mathon ke liye ye baat nahin kahi ja sakati jinhone siddharmaiya ke is kadam kii khulkar vakaalat kii thi
 This means that even the stakes of giving minority community status have not been able to break the bjp's Lingayat vote-bank
 virshaiv samudaay bijepi ke paksh main majbootee se data dikhataa he or uski koshish aise shaks ko haraane kii najar aati he jisane unhen baantne kaa daanv chalaa
 Even the Congress believes that there will be no significant increase in Lingayat votes in its favor
 congress ke sheersh netaa ab daawa kar rahe hai ki unhone bijepi se lingayat voton ke bade paimaane par chhitakane kii ummid kabhi nahin kii thi
 Yes, the Lingayat bets did so much that the BJP was temporarily brought into defensive mode in order to distinguish the open cracks of this community
 dushman ko usee kii pich par pachhaadne ke uddeshy se laai gai ranneeti ko lekarsiddharmaiya ne apane patteechchhi tarah khele

 rahul gandhi apane job main ho rahe hai behatarpahale rahul gandhi kii sabase badi dikkaton main se ek ye maani jaati thi ki ve apni hi sena ko apane peeche ekajute lekar chalane main naakaam rahete hai
 Rahul's long list of grievances from the people in his circle was heard earlier on how the boss's inability to make decisions comes in the way and how he has a tendency to come into effect when he eats out vested interests
 ab lagata he ki paristhitiyaan badal rahi hai
 Rahul's army now appears more firmly behind him
 saath hi unke yoddha ab ye daawa karte bhi nahin thakte ki rahul ab badale hue vyakti hai jinhone aakhirkaar majbootee se faisle lenaa shuru kar diya he
 Rahul is also seen playing the same game that other leaders play
 rahul ke prachaar abhiyaan ko trek karte vakt unke ek sahyogi ne hamase kaha, ‘bos ko ab koi topi nahin pahana saktaa
 'during the Gujarat campaign too, there were many such reports that Rahul seems to have changed beforehand
 uske baad se unka aatmavishvaas ab ek paaydaan or upar chadha lagata he
 a near defeat in Gujarat gave Rahul the same confidence that is believed to be rooted in the modi-shah duo till now
 ab rahul ke bolte samay vaise hi vyakti jaisaa bhav dikhataa he jo sochataa he ki wo jeet rahaa he
 Earlier Rahul used to take great care in attacking PM Modi personally, but now he seems to have caught the path of open attack
 haalanki abhi ye dekhnaa baaki he ki kya ye rahul ke liye smart move hoga ki jis shaks ke paas koi prashaskeey anubhav nahin he wo bharat ke sabase durjey rajaneta ke saath sidhe panja ladaana chahta he
 But this decision of Rahul matters
 raajnneetik rup se apni lakeer badi karne kaa rasta modi gaatha ko dhwast karke banaaya jaae
 Even the top BJP leaders believe that the Congress has done well in this election
 saath hi party ke bheetar aapas main takaraane vaale hiton kaa prabandhan karne main bhi congress kaamyaab rahi he
 In the last elections, the enmity of Congress leaders has damaged the party in many seats
 aisa lagata he ki rahul is par kaaphi had tak ankush lagane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 There are many leaders in the Congress who reject Siddaramaiah, but none of them appear to be doing anything openly that would harm the party's interests

 CEO of India's best-performing CEO Amit Shahrahul Gandhi's problem is that he faces a person like Amit Shah
 ek taraf jahaan haal ke varshon main congress sanghathan bahut chatka he vahiin shah ne bijepi sanghathan ko teji se dobaaraa khadaa kiya he jo ki apane aap main prabandhan kii safalataa kii kahani he
 The story that fits perfectly for an MBA case study at a top Ivy League school
 kai rajyon main, congress ke paas bahut kam hi asli santhnik dhaancha bachaa he
 The Congress is in the hands of strong local leaders who help the party candidates in their areas of influence
 yadi inamen se koi bhi netaa congress chhod detaa he, to us vishesh kshetra main party kaa dhaancha hi uske saath chalaa jaataa he
 Such setbacks make the Congress weak
 congress kii is khami ko shah lagatarabijepi ke hakamen bhunaate aa rahe hai
 At the same time, Amit Shah has managed to create a strong structure for the BJP in every nook and corner of the country
 choti se choti unit kii barikiyon par shah kaam karte hai
 Just as the BJP is able to fill its message in every house, it is miles ahead of the Congress in this matter
 maujuuda sthiti main congress or bijepi kii senaaon main antar utana hi bada he jitna 1962 ke yuddh ke dauraan bhartiya or chini senaaon ke bich tha
 With the use of new age apps from the BJP, the support of many whatsapp groups, as well as the presence of dedicated and militant activists on the ground, helps the party reach the electorate at a level the Congress cannot
 aise main sthaneey netaaon ke paas party ko bandhak bana kar rakhane kii gunjaaish bahut kam rah jaati he
 Even the ticket of BS Yeddyurappa's son is cut and he is unable to do anything
 sivaae iske ki apane ahm ko gale se neeche utaar kar party ke faisle ko sir-maathe par dharen
 The Congress used to have an organization called Seva Dal at the grassroots level, which used to help the Congress get the voters to the last mile at the time of elections
 barason tak dhyaan naa die jane kii vajah se seva dal ab apane majboot ateet kii kamjor chaaya hi ban kar rah gaya he
 The BJP is not only tying up with local Congress leaders but also making sure that these defectors will also bring dedicated workers of Seva Dal with them
 jab tak rahul gandhi congress sanghathan ko neeche se upar tak majboot banane ke liye yuddh str par muhim nahin chhedate or seva dal jaise sanghathanon ko nai dhar dene ke liye dobaaraa khadaa nahin karte, tab tak kaante ke chunaav main bijepi se muqabla karne ke liye unke paas koi ummid nahin he
 In a close fight, it matters a lot who has more ability to bring voters to the polling booth
 or yahi aksar haar or jeet kii vajah ban jaataa he
 The BJP has no match in this matter

 Siddaramaiah's 'destiny' is shining brightly as far as tricycle leaders are concerned, BJP is facing a tough challenge from Siddaramaiah in Karnataka
 mukhyamantri ne raajnneetik kshamtaaon ke maamle main behtareen cargujari dikhaai he
 Siddaramaiah has managed to set a consistent agenda for this election
 aamtaur par dekha jaataa he ki ye bijepi hi hoti he jo apane siyaasi golabarood se akraman karti he or saamne vaale ko dephence ke liye cover ke neeche aane ko majaboor hona padataa he
 This time in Karnataka, whether it was a separate flag for the state or the fight against Hindi or the Lingayat card bets, it was Siddaramaiah who came to the front foot to bat and the BJP was forced to respond
 campagne kaa peechha karte hue ham jahaan bhi gaye, hamane siddharmaiya ke khilaaf anti inkambency factor ko koi khaas kargar hote nahin dekha
 At a time when Karnataka has a 30-year history that no ruling party regained power after the completion of a five-year term, Siddaramaiah's achievement is no less great
 mukhyamantri ke saath car par safar karte hamane dekha ki jahaan se bhi kafila gujarata tha vahaan logon ke chehre par apane mukhyamantri ko dekhne ke baad chamak aa jaati
 Regardless of the age group, people should show genuine gratitude to the Chief Minister
 rajya main mukhyamantri kii bhagya yojanaayen badi kaamyaab rahi hai
 In fact, every household has got the benefit of some government scheme
 yah ek alag maamla he ki vokkaliga jaisi agadi jatiyon main siddharmaiya ke liye behad naapsandgi he
 Siddaramaiah did not do anything special to bring him with him
 lekin pichhadon or agadon kii chunavi jang main pichhadon kaa bahumat ek paksh main hona hameshaa phydemand rahata he
 a person who came to the Congress only in 2006, for such a person, Siddaramaiah, to maintain complete dominance over the party and government in the state is no less big achievement
 wo bhi aisi sthiti main jab kai taraf se virdohi un par ghaat lagaae baithe the
 If Siddaramaiah is able to win the Congress majority on 15 May, his stature will definitely emerge as the third most important leader in the Congress after Rahul and Sonia Gandhi
 mukhyamantri kii team main unke kareebi daawa karte hai ki agar siddharmaiya ne upi jaise rajya main wo kaam kiya hota jo unhone karnataka main karke dikhaaya to ve gavarnence ke behtareen trek record vaale majboot siem ke taur par pradhanmantri pad ke liye swaabhaavik daavedaar ho jate

 vindhyas ke neeche modi factor kitna kargar?kai raajnneetik jaankaar ye anumaan vyakt karte rahe hai ki vindhyas ke aage modi factor adhik kargar nahin rahegaa
 They are wrong bijepi kya sochati he ise chhodie, congress kaa andruni feedback bhi ye kah rahaa he ki karnataka main chunaav prachaar ke aakhri charan main pradhanmantri modi 18 se 25 ayuvarg ke matadaataaon par prabhaav daalane main safal rahe hai
 This is a matter of concern for the Congress thinktank
 is ayuvarg se karnataka main 65 lakh matadaata hai
 This is 13 percent of the total voters of the state
 aadhunik bhartiya raajnneeti main votaron ko modane main piem modi kii kshamta kaa koi muqabla nahin he
 Although BJP leaders also believe that some part of the political message is lost while translating, PM Modi is the only Brahmastra in bjp's quiver
 modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure hone par bhi brand modi par anti inkambency kaa koi asar najar nahin aata
 His personal appeal is still the same as it was when he took charge of the Prime Minister's Office
 sambhavat: duniya main kisi bhi bade loktantr main aisa koi netaa nahin he jo har chunaav ko apni sarkaar ke pradarshan par raajnneetik sweekruti main badal detaa he or matadaataaon ko vaise hi prabhavit karata he jaise ki modi karte hai

 rajasthan or madhya pradesh ko lekar bijepi chintitcongress ne jaise apane game ko behatar kiya he, rahul gandhi ne jis tarah adarshavaad kii lakeer se hatakar vyaavhaarik faisle lenaa shuru kiya he, bijepi ko ye chintaa sataane lagi he ki is saal ke aakhir main madhya pradesh or rajasthan main kya hoga
 In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is embroiled in a battle with party president Amit Shah over who will become the party's president in the state
 shah kendriya krishi or kisaan kalyaan rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ke liye batting kar rahe hai vahiin raaje ne apni pansad kii fehrist thamai he
 The bjp's internal assessment says that a heavy anti-incumbency trend is working against the Chief Minister in Rajasthan
 or agar tatkaal upachaaratmak kadam nahin uthaae jate to party ko rajya main badi haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Raje sees such efforts as undermining his government
 ab jabaki rajasthan main chunaav sirf chah maheene hi dur hai, bijepi ko rajya main bhagirath chunauti kaa saamana he
 Regarding Madhya Pradesh, the BJP was hoping that Rahul Gandhi would appoint his friend Jyotiraditya Scindia to take over the reins of the Congress campaign there
 lekin iske bajaay rahul ne camel nath ko chunaa
 Kamal Nath is considered a clever player of politics
 ve bhi un tikadmi khelon main maahir hai jinamein bijepi ke sheersh netritv ko bejod mana jaataa he
 Kamal Nath also has the resources which are considered necessary for running a sharp campaign
 is ghatnakram ne madhyapradesh main bijepi ke liye chizon ko bhi mushkil banaaya he
 While the BJP still hopes to win in Madhya Pradesh
 lekin party kaa sheersh netritv maanata he ki agar mukaable main chatur oparator ho to teen kaarykaal kii anti inkambency ke saath tabhi saamana kiya ja saktaa he jabaki apane pradarshan ko bahut oonche str par le jaaya jaae
 The party expects the Madhya Pradesh elections to turn into a corporate versus farmer battle
 jahaan camel nath ko corporate kii aankh ke dulaare ke taur par or shivaraj singh chouhan ko dharti ke vinamr putr ke taur par pesh kiya jaae
 The son of the earth who did a lot for the betterment of farmers in the state

 2019: The real test of Brand Modi will be in front of a united opposition, BJP leaders claim that coming together with Mayawati and Akhilesh in Uttar Pradesh, there is no real threat to the party's prospects in the 2019 general elections
 lekin nijee taur par party netaa maanate hai ki vipakshi senaaon ke saath aane se 2019 kii ladaai usase kahin zyada mushkil ho jaaegi, jaise ki maani ja rahi thi
 In 2014, the BJP won a major victory in states like UP as opposition votes were split in a multi-cornered contest
 bijepi ab ummid kar rahi he ki buaa-bhattije kii jodi ko jameen par apane gathbandhan ko amali jama pehanaane main mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pade
 The party also multiplies that while Muslim votes will be mobilized in favor of SP-BSP alliance, Samajwadi Party will find it difficult to shift its Yadav votes to BSP candidates
 aise hi bispi ko apane bache hue gaiyr-jatav vot bank ko espi ummidavaaron ke paksh main transfar karnaa kathin lagegaa
 Before the Bihar elections, the bjp's top leadership described it as a mythical war in which the bjp's army on one side and the entire united opposition on the other side
 bijepi kaa sheersh netritv sochataa tha ki modi or shah kaa santhnik kaushal unhen rajya main 50 fisadi se adhik vot dilaaegaa, lekin bijepi ke liye bihar main jis tarah ke ulate nattejey aae uske baad se party netritv zyada satark he
 The BJP is hoping that if it loses any loss in the Hindi belt, it will compensate it from new areas
 aakhir main brand modi par hi sab aa tikega
 Will a majority of voters give Modi a second term on the basis of the government's five years of functioning

 The secret agreement between BJP and JDS The BJP is giving contradictory indications as to the possibility of alliance between BJP and JDS in Karnataka
 vahiin jedies kii ore se bijepi ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke gathbandhan ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya ja rahaa he
 However, at the ground level it looks like daylight BJP and JDS are working under strategic partnership
 khaastaur par dakshini karnataka main old mysore ke hisson me ye talmail saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 BJP has fielded weak candidates in those seats where JDS candidates are in a better position to defeat Congress
 haalanki bijepi karnataka main apane boote bahumat kii ummid kar rahi he, lekin agar wo bahumat se dur rahati he to jedies ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ko moort rup dene ke liye jamini kaam abhi se shuru kar chuki he
 On the other hand, the Congress is also reaching out to the JDS candidates through local veteran leaders such as Karnataka Energy Minister DK Shivakumar and former JDS veteran CM Ibrahim
 congress ko ummid he ki agar 15 may ko jarurat padi to inhen apane saath laane main dikkat nahin aegi
 JDS leader and former Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy does not refrain from showing his bloodshed to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 kumaraswami kaa drudh mat he ki congress se tab tak kisi tarah ke talmail kii sambhaavna nahin he jab tak wo siddharmaiya se paala nahin chhudaa leti
 There are some leaders in the Congress who are hoping that if the Congress stays away from the majority, they can get an opportunity to become the Chief Minister themselves in the event of an alliance with the JDS

 Now the BJP needs to step up its game, Congress lost control of the national scene shortly after the victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and was never in a position to regain it again
 soshal media par congress sarkaar kaa uphaas udata rahaa or rahul gandhi ko pappu kah kar ninda kii jaati rahi
 The Congress could not do anything to overcome such a situation, but for the past one year, the Congress has dramatically raised its media game
 randeep surajevaala or divya spandana ne party ke liye media or soshal media oparations ko anjaam dene main acha kaam karke dikhaaya he
 Now it is different that both of them do not sit on the track much
 congress ab is nichod par pahunchi he ki akraman hi akelaa bachaav he or modi-shah kii jodi se ladaai ke liye akelaa rasta yahi he ki party lagaataar atake ke mod main rahe
 Of course, some attacks were exaggerated
 congress bachaav main yahi daleel detii he ki ye rukh thik vaisaa hi jaisaa bijepi ne congress ke saath kiya tha
 Therefore, Congress is now paying in the same style
 congress ke aisa rukh apnaane se bijepi kii soshal media par badhat chup gai he
 Broadly, now both the parties are at war on par
 haalanki bijepi ke netaa ab bhi congress ke netaaon se adhik lokapriy hai lekin congress kai maukon par agenda set karne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Earlier it was the Congress, which needed help to improve its social media game
 lekin ab bijepi ko 2019 chunaav se pehle soshal media front par apane kaushal ko ooncha uthaane kii aavashyaktaa lagati he
 Only then can she hope to maintain her lead on this front
 bijepi netritv ab kahata he ki soshal media chunaav kaa rukh nahin modta or ye bas media par kissagoi ko aakaar dene main hi upyogi rahata he

 Fadnavis said, "thackeray and NCP and Congress had demanded payment of Rs 23,000 crore in the past

 '' unhone kaha ki shivasena ne purv main 7 / 11 bhoomi ricard parchi dene kaa kaam puraa karne kii maang kii thi
 He said that the Thackeray-led state government should do it as soon as possible

 Karnataka has got another bad reputation after the hooliganism in Mangalore pub
 samskruti ke thekedaar ban baithe kuch logon ne bas main saath safar kar rahe ladkaa ladki ko nishaanaa banaaya he
 The boy and girl were surrounded and beaten by a mob in Mangalore and the two were taken away in two directions
 jis ladki ke saath ye ghatana hui wo kerala ke sipiem party ke emele kii beti he
 The police investigation in this case is going towards a large Hinduist organization
 police ne ghatana ke liye jimmedaar chaar logon kii pahchaan kii he, jinamein se do giraftaar kar liye gaye hai
 The two people arrested by the police are bus operators and are associated with a large Hinduist organization
 inke naam prakaash or rajesh hai
 The matter of both being related to the organization is being confirmed
 peedit ladki ne bataaya 'unalogon ne mujhe bas main pakadaa or kaha ki police stesan le ja rahe hai, lekin wo koi or jagah thi
 Those people were talking something in the local language
 meri pahchaan jaanane ke baad unhone mujhe chhod diya lekin mere dost ke saath badasluki kii
 They beat my friend a lot
 wo ek privet bas thi lekin bas main maujuud kisi musafir ne koi madad nahin kii
 They got into the bus, pulled me, pulled my friend and started slapping him
 ' ghatana ke mutabik ladki kerala ke kasargod main majeshwar se bas se chali thi
 Four people boarded the bus at Mangalore's Pampaval and dragged down the mla's daughter and the boy sitting with her
 iske baad donon ko saream peeta gaya or phir donon ko do dishaao main kuch dur le jaakar chhod diya gaya
 The needle of suspicion of the police is once again going towards the big Hinduist organization
 lekin apharan or ladki ko peetane ke iljaam main giraftaar hue do gundon ne naa to apane sanghathan kaa naam ugala or naa hi kisi sanghathan ne jimmedaari lee
 The charges are also on the driver and conductor of the bus, so the suspicion is also of mutual rivalry, but after the statement of the Kerala Home Minister, the politics got heated
 kerala ne is maamle main aapatti jatai
 The Chief Minister of Karnataka could not avoid this objection from Kerala like last time and for the first time he showed strict attitude about hooliganism in the name of culture
 jabaki centre sarkaar ne ek baar phir karnataka kii bijepi sarkaar ko kosa
 There have been two incidents of hooliganism in Mangalore
 pehali ghatana he 24 janvari kii jab shriram sena ke kaaryakartaaon ne ek pub amnesia baar par hamalaa bolaa
 She dragged the girls present at the bar and beat them brutally
 iske baad nai ghatana he bas kii
 Be careful if your computer's operating system is Windows XP

 Microsoft India MD Ketan Bajwa said that now only 30 days are left and after that we will stop supporting it
 unhone kaha ki microsoft ne XP ko 12 saal tak saport kiya jabaki ausatan koi bhi technology paanch saal se zyada nahin chalati
 He said that no update or software will be available for this after 8 April
 is samay bady-badi companiyon main 40 lakh se bhi zyada pisi kaam kar rahe hai jo windos XP par aadhaarit hai
 Now most of these consumers are moving to Windows 7 or 8
 bainkon or sarkari companiyon main yah abhi kaam kar rahaa he lekin aane vaale samay main vahaan bahut pareshaani aegi
 Microsoft currently has three types of operating systems and it is becoming difficult for the company to support all three
 ek export ne aagaah kiya he ki 8 april ke baad jaise hi microsoft is system se apane ko alag kar legaa, haikar isamen ghus jaaenge or 29 pratishat tak computer hack ho jaaenge
 That is, this system will be risky

 Apart from this, Jharkhand has withdrawn more than one lakh cases against the tribals as part of a strategy to win the trust of the rural section of the society under the influence of tribals and Maoists

 As part of the government's retaliatory campaign in areas with heavy presence of Maoists, trained soldiers of guerrilla warfare are being told to the locals that the Naxalites have been officially declared as terrorists

 This frightening information is coming with the information that the Maoists are going to join hands with the rebels of the north-east
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki isse suraksha chunautiyaan or jatil ho jaati hai
 To deal with this, 70,000 paramilitary forces have been deployed

 ve vishesh aarthik kshetra (sej) ke chalate paidaa hone vaale visthaapan sambandhi masale par gramin asantosh ko bhunaane main jaraa bhi der nahin karte or apane liye aadhaar taiyaar karte hai
 Recently, the Center has tried to counter such efforts by campaigning against the heinous murder of people like Induvar

 In addition, some early military successes have also gone hand

 40 Maoists and six security personnel were killed in this attack, but even more important is that for the first time security forces reached Chinta Cave
 maovadiyon kii panaahagaah samaj jane vaala yah kshetra barudi surangon ke kaaran pahunch se dur najar aata tha
 One more reason for this campaign to be important is that the cooperation that is expected from the respective states is seen this time
 aise sahyog ke abhaav kii vajah se hi ab tak maovadi virdohi abhiyaan naakaam rahete aae hai
 The reason for the success of the Chintan cave campaign was also that police forces were stationed in neighboring states of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, which hindered the way for militants to go from one state to another
 ugravadiyon kii yah chaal kaaphi puraani he
 Attempts to link tribal areas to the mainstream, apart from the recent arrests of important Maoist leaders like Kobad Ghandi and Chhatradhar Mahato, the Induwar massacre and ghastly scandals like Gadchiroli were carried out
 isane centre ko apane aakraamak abhiyaanon ko samay se pehle shuru karne ko baadhya kiya
 Due to surveillance and better coordination through helicopters, the security forces quickly captured the area and drove the militants out of their stronghold forest

 It is also important that this campaign is headed by a special team led by CRPF Special DG Vijay Raman
 isamen aise visheshgy shaamil hai jinhen kashmir main baghawat kuchalane kaa anubhav he
 Of course it all sounds encouraging to read, but will it also work? It still has huge flaws, including lack of security personnel, lack of weapons training in police, and lack of equipment and infrastructure

 Political and police concepts differ in Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, most affected by Naxal violence, which may have an impact on the success of the campaign
 yah abhiyaan kii safalataa ke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 The crumbling administrative machinery in Jharkhand, the collapse of political institutions, the decay of some taxing system and the declining morale of the police have only helped the spread of Left Wing Extremism
 orissa main mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ne apane police bal ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye paise na dene yaa siarpief tathaa cobra commando ko adhik sankhya main tainaat na karne ke liye centre sarkaar ko doshi tehraaya he
 Chidambaram says that the Center has given Rs 1,250 crore to the states for modernization of the police force
 aavantit kiye hai
 But the differences in this matter are obvious and may affect the center's campaign of fear and temptation
 deeledhale prashasan ke kaaran bhi maovadi jharkhand or pashchim bengal ke bich awajahi karte rahe hai
 One of the reasons behind the Lalgarh scandal is the failures of the CPI (M) administration, the second reason is that the militants have been moving to Jharkhand very easily

 Not only are the Maoist attacks causing more loss of life and property, but they have been emboldened after the capture of Lalgarh

 chidambaram kii ranneeti mukhyatah inhen rajyon se siikhe sabkon par aadhaarit he, jahaan ugravad main kami ai he
 Now the danger is that the Maoists may intensify their activities if the issue of total development of the underprivileged is neglected for a long time

 adivasee jameen ke maamle nibatane ke liye gathit aath main se sirf do adaalaton main nyaayadhish hai or kul 40,000 maamle lambit hai
 Such apathy and administrative failure and government insensitivity to the needs of the underprivileged is prevalent in all states
 maovadiyon se nibatane ke liye aisi bahuaiami ranneeti kaa makasad suraksha balon ko vah majbootee dena he, jisaki unhen jarurat he
 But the picture will be clear only after the big campaign started after Diwali
 chidambaram sahi kaam ke liye sahi vyakti hai lekin lambey samay tak satat or sahi talmail ke saath chalaa abhiyaan hi apekshit parinaam de saktaa he
 This would require substantial cooperation between states, in view of the fact that such an expectation seems to be higher
 haal hi main maovadiyon ne hinsak vaaradaaten badha di hai
 But what is encouraging is that Gadchiroli saw 70 per cent turnout in the Assembly elections held last week despite the Maoist menace

 And one of them is his mansion
 osama kii haveli, wo haveli jo na pahaado kii gufaaon main he or na kisi sunsaan ilaake main
 Rather this mansion is built on the chest of the Pakistan Army Academy
 dedh baje is ghadi kii suiyaan band ho gayi hai or yahi wo vakt he jabaki pakistan ke atbabad main ek behad rahasyamayi kothi main behad khaufnak ghatana ghati thi
 In the broad daylight after the shining of the dark dark night of Amavas, people in the daylight were seeing this building which they had been seeing everyday for five years
 imaarat ke bheetar se hi duniya kaa sabase khatarnaak aatanki chalaata tha apana nizaam is par unhen bharosa nahin ho rahaa tha
 But the truth is that Osama bin Laden was locked in this house for the last five years
 afghanistan kii pahadiyon main jahaan america uske liye khaak chaan rahaa tha vahiin osama bin laden pakistan ke nihaayat mahfuj abtabad main baitha tha
 Only one person came out of the house riding in a red car and the people living inside the mansion had no raft from any person in the area
 or jab is ghar ke daravaaje duniya ke liye khule to kaanp gayi puri duniya
 This house was built very leisurely for Osama bin Laden, who runs a construction company
 ek mashin thi jiske saamne khadey shaks kii tasviir ghar ke bheetar baithe logon ko dikhaayi padati he or plastic ke dibbe main lage mike se ghar ke bheetar ek spikar judaa hota he jisase baahar kii awaajen andar jaati hai
 This is the first evidence of Laden's very safe building
 agar yahaan se ijaajat milti thi to abhi band ye lohe kaa get khulata tha or aadmi khud ko ek galiyare main khadaa paata tha
 And when that corridor ended, another iron gate was found which opened to a courtyard and was the way from the same courtyard to this main building
 is ghar main ghusaa koi bhi shaks baraabar ghar kii teesri manzil kii najar main rahata tha
 And Osama lived in the third floor of this house
 yani osama har harakat par khud bhi najar rakhata tha
 The house where Osama was hiding had double walls and a special kind of foam and some other things were filled in between the two walls
 is tarah se mana ja rahaa he ki ye imaarat ko soundpruf or bulatopruf banane kaa tarika bhi ho saktaa he
 CCTV cameras were installed all around this building, whose control room was directly near Osama and cctvs were also installed which covered every corner of the entire building
 imaarat ke bheetar dhokhaa dene vaali chhaten banaayi gayin thi or hamale ke dauraan america kamandon ne unhen khoj kar benakaab kar diya he aisi hi ek falls ceiling bhi vahaan thi
 Tight security arrangements were made around the night and especially at the gate to protect the house
 puure ghar ke ird-gird bijli ke lamp the
 This house of Osama had one or not many TV sets and they were a little old fashioned but the way of showing pictures on them was very new
 ghar kii chat par lagi dit chhatari
 That is, Osama bin Laden or his fellow people were connected to the outside world through equal TV sets
 laden biimaar shaks tha
 Therefore, for the convenience of him and the people living in the house, split acs were also installed, whose cooling unit is outside and the cool air went into the room without much noise
 osama ke is thikaane main khaali padi jameen main behad mordan tareeke se green house bana kar subjiyon kii kheti hoti thi
 The green house cover has been removed but its structure is still there

 Hemp plants are found in large numbers along the fields
 osama bin laden ne dudhmunhe bacchon ke liye ghaki ke bheetar ek gaay, ek bhens paal rakhi thi
 In addition, two rabbits have been found and a dog
 osama ke ghar main badi taadaad main cricket kii genden bhi mili hai
 These lilies belong to the children of the neighborhood who would not have come out if they had gone inside the house
 inke badale bacchon ko get par sau se deb sau rupaya de diya jaataa tha
 a large number of dirty clothes have been found in the bundles of clothes inside Osama's house, it seems as if the clothes have been collected for years
 lagata he osama apane istemaal kiye kapade phenkata nahin tha or nahin unhen khatm karata tha tabhi to yahaan badi taadaad main ye kapade ikattha the
 By the way, it is said that Osama did not throw his household garbage outside and used to burn it inside the house
 par phir bhi uske ghar main kaaphi zyada kooda ikattha tha
 There were no phones in Osama's kothi, no internet connection, but it is not that Osama was bereft of today's technology
 osama ke hytech hone ke saboot bhi isi haveli se hi mili
 According to the Americans, Laden did not use any technology for security that could be traced
 par america suraksha agenciyon ko wajiristan kothi ke bheetar se 10 hard drive, 5 computer, 100 se zyada storage divaais mili hai
 In addition, when the search was done after the operation, two phone numbers were found inside his clothes
 jeb main 50 euro the
 In this way, the world's biggest terrorist used all modern things for information, which is considered a symbol of modernity today
 par osama is baat kaa dhyaan rakhata tha ki wo na to internet se judi hon or na hi unki frickvency ko pakadaa ja sake
 This three-storey house of Laden was built in two thousand yards
 is ghar main kul 11 kamare the, isamen pehali manzil main 4 kamare the, duusari manzil main bhi 4 kamare the, teesri manzil main teen kamare the
 All the stairs were inside the house, the balcony surrounded by high walls
 is behad bade ghar kii teesri manzil main osama bin laden apni beti or bivi kii ankhon ke saamne maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 Most of the people of Afghan origin lived around the cold Choa area where Osama's terror base was built
 haalanki sthaneey logon se uskaa koi lenaa dena nahin tha phir bhi ye baat mahatvapurn he kyonki afghanistan main jindagi bhar aatank kii fasal paidaa karne vaale laden ko unheen par bharosa tha
 a large number of medicines have been found in this mansion in Laden
 jaisaa ki sabko pataa he ki laden kii kidney kharaab thim or use baraabar dialysis kii jarurat padati thi
 a passport found inside the house shows that a Yemeni-born female doctor had been living with her for the past five years, one of her wives
 iske alaava laden ke ghar se majahabin kitaaben badi taadaad main mili hai jo ki shaayad ghar main rah rahe bacchon yaa phir laden ke padhane ke kaam aati rahi hongin
 Osama's mansion was no less than a religion
 baahar se shaayad hi kisi ko is haveli ke bare main kuch pataa chale
 But inside, just think as if there is a maze
 osama kii jindagi jitne rahasyon se bhari thi, uski is haveli main usase kahin zyada tilism bhare pade hai
 If you look at this house from outside, only high walls will be visible
 andar kya he- kisi ko kuch nahin pataa
 Nobody from outside can see the situation inside even after wanting
 deevaaron kii is sarhad kii duusari taraf jo imaarat khadi he, usamen hi rahata tha duniya kaa sabase bada aatankwaadi osama
 Behind these walls was an empire of terror
 aap hairaan rah jaaenge ye dekhakar ki apni is haveli main surakshit rahane ke liye osama bin laden ne kitne khaas tarah ke upaay kar rakhe the
 Some part of the bungalow wall is 12 feet high
 thodi dur ke baad ye oonchai bad jaati he
 Somewhere the wall is 18 feet
 jahaan par 18 feet kii ye diwaar he, vahaan kuch kamare bane hue hai
 Where the construction of the inside room ends, the wall height decreases again
 kuch dur tak ye diwaar 13 feet oonchi he
 This wall also goes straight and turns inwards
 jo diwaar andar kii taraf mudati he, uski oonchai 11 feet he
 The yard in which the three-storey building remains for Osama bin Laden is surrounded by walls
 get se satee ek diwaar kii oonchai 12 feet kii he
 The wall of the part from which Osama had little to do is 10 feet in height
 get number ek
 a long lane begins after this gate
 gali kii duusari taraf hai 12 feet oonchi diwaar
 Gate number two will come after a long lane
 lekin is daravaaje ko paar karne ke baad bhi laden ke kareeb nahin pahunch sakate the
 Because after this you have to get through another small gate
 osama bin laden ne is tilismi kile main rahane ke liye or bhi khaas tarah ke intjaam kiye hue the
 Gate number one was mounted on the camera and microphone, which would read the face and voice of every visitor
 get number ek se andar aane par puri gali main makaan kii duusari or teesri manzil se rakhi ja sakati thi najar
 Apart from this, the windows of the house were such that every action from outside could be monitored
 lekin baahar se andar kuch bhi nahin dikhataa tha
 The house looked very common
 aam si hi dikhne vaali deevaaren
 Osama used to live inside this house that was visible from the ordinary with the complete preparation that no one even knew about it
 osama ke is kile kii deevaaron kii majbootee kaa andaja lagaaie ki helicopter krash ho gaya or diwaar main bas ek daraar bhar ai
 If there was another wall, do not know what would happen to it
 lekin osama ne in deevaaron or makaan ko banane kii khaas tarah ke intjaam karwaae the
 Cement bricks were installed in the walls
 deevaaren dohari parat ke bani hui thim
 Two bricks of wall were filled with foam and another metal
 matlab in deevaaron ko ek tarah se bulatopruf banaaya gaya tha
 This was Osama bin Laden's house
 usee osama kaa jo construction company chalaata tha
 Apparently it was specially made
 is tilismi makaan ke andar or bhi hai rahasy
 Terror means Osama, Terror means Osama
 wo naam jiske naam se aatank bhi kaanp jaae lekin sil 6 commandos ko osama kii isi haveli main uskaa ek nayaa cheharaa bhi dikhaai diya
 You still see blood everywhere in Osama's house, but there was a lot in the eleven rooms of this house, which can be called the world of humans living in Havan's house
 masalan laden ke saath is wajiristan haveli main kul 36 log rahete the
 Of these, 23 were children, 9 women and four men
 isamen se osama kii do patniyaan, do betiyaan auki ek betaa tha
 Of which son Ibrahim has been killed, while two daughters Amra, 22, and Maryam, 26, have been injured, who have been sent to a secret hideout after treatment
 iske alaava ghar main ashat khan or tarik khan naam ke do shaks rahete the jinhen laden kaa doot mana jaataa he or jo is hamale main maare gaye
 Ashd and Tariq lived in another part of the house
 ashat kii patni or teen bachche bhi uske saath hi rahete the

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has supported PM Modi on demonetisation
 iske baad ye kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki bijepi ko lekar nitish naram padate ja rahe hai or aage vah mahagathbandhan ko chhodkar bijepi ke saath ho sakate hai
 But, RJD chief Lalu has called all these speculations meaningless
 lalu ne mahagathbandhan main sab kuch thik hone kaa daawa kiya
 He said that Nitish would be foolish if he would go to BJP
 mahagathbandhan ko koi khatra nahin'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet menlalu prasad yadavane is prakaar ke tamaam atakalon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki mahagathbandhan sarkaar main kisi prakaar kii dikkat nahin he
 The government will complete its 5 years
 unhone kaha, 'mahagathbandhan main koi daraar nahin he
 Nitish Kumar has supported PM Modi on demonetisation, as he is with public problems
 sarkaar ko kisi prakaar kaa koi khatra nahin he
 BJP pretends when asked if Nitish Kumar has softened up about BJP, then rjdsuprimo said that Nitish will not do so
 lalune kaha ki vah khud bhi aisa kuch nahin karenge ki unki sarkaar ko kisi prakaar kaa khatra ho
 He said, "are we going to cut the same tree as the tree?" It is wrong to say that Nitish Kumar is going towards BJP

 ' donald trump or sadik khan main jubaani jangtvit kar landan meyar par trump ne saadhaa nishanadonald trump ke golf khilne par kiya tha savalmerica raashtrapati donald trump kab kisapar nishaanaa saadh den, iskaa andaja unke sahyogiyon ko bhi nahin lag paata he
 Now something similar has happened once again and this time Donald Trump's mayor is London Mayor Sadiq Khan
 donald trump ne twitor par sadik khan par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha ki acha ho ki wo landan main hone vaale ‘nif (chaaku) krime’ par focus karen
 There has been this heated debate between the two leaders before
 darasal, landan ke meyar sadik khan ne ek bayaan main kaha tha ki jab america main ‘dorian chakravaat’ aane ko he, tab raashtrapati donald trump golf khilne main biji hai
 On this, Donald Trump tweeted and wrote that the incompetent Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has questioned my playing golf
 donald trump ne likhaa ki main apane routine ke aadhaar par aage badhata hum, agar baraak obama hote to vah hawaii chale jate
 Sadiq Khan should focus on 'knife Crime' in London, which is becoming out of control in London
 
 
 
 
 ”knife crime,” which is totally out of control in London
 People are afraid to even walk the streets
 He is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) September 3, 2019 Trump wrote on Twitter that people in London are afraid to walk on the streets
 ek behad kharaab meyar jinhen hamaare kaamkaaj se dur rahanaa chahie
 Actually, the special thing about these tweets is that Donald Trump also spelled the name of Sadiq Khan wrong
 haalanki, baad main unhone isamen sudhaar bhi kiya
 Actually, the verbal war between Donald Trump and Sadiq Khan is quite old
 ye ladaai 2015 se shuru hui thi, jab sadik khan ne donald trump par unke prachaar ke tareeke par nishaanaa saadhaa tha or kaha tha ki donald trump anti muslim bayaan de rahe hai
 Then when Donald Trump arrived in London in 2018, Trump said that Sadiq Khan as Mayor of London has failed to stop terrorism and his work is quite bad

 guuruuvaar ko ipel main do aisi tiimon ke bich takkar he, jinke paas stars kii kami nahin
 But despite the glut of star players in both teams, Delhi seems to be breathless in the tournament due to their batting, so the Mumbai bowlers are looking very pale
 vaise ipel main record ke lihaaz se donon tiimon ke bich abtak barabari kii takkar rahi he
 Both the teams have 7-7 matches in 14 matches between the two teams so far
 yani takkar kaante kii he
 Delhi, who have won only two wins last season, clash with former champions Mumbai
 muqaabala firozshah kotla par hona he, isliye dilli ko gharelu team hone kaa thodaa faaydaa to zarur milegaa
 But Delhi have so far won two out of five matches in the tournament, while Mumbai have won one of the five matches
 haalanki dilli ke chaar-paanch ballebaazon ne alag-alag maichon main ran banaae hai
 The team ran very little together as a team
 yuvaraj singh (5 match-120 ran), captain jepi dumini (5 match-129 ran) or manoj tiwari (4 match kii 2 pariyon main 32 ran) jaise top order ballebaazon ko jeet ke liye apni sahi taaqat dikhaane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Otherwise it will be too late
 yuva ballebaaz shreyas ayyar (5 maichon-144 ran), or salaami ballebaaz mayank agarwal (5 match-122 ran) ne apni pratibha se sabko prabhavit kiya he
 Fans of Delhi will have great expectations from them
 dilli ke kam se kam chaar gendbaaz 8 ran prati over se kam kii dar se ran kharch rahe hai
 Bowlers like Imran Tahir (5 matches 10 wickets), JP Duminy (5 matches 7 wickets) and Nathan Coulter Nile (5 matches 5 wickets), who are in the most amazing form in the IPL, can win Delhi's heart once again
 5 main se ek match jeet chuki purv champion mumbai kii team pichley match kii tarah vipakshi team kii pich par jeet ke dastakhat karnaa chaahegi
 The Mumbai batsmen have played nine fifties innings so far and have hit more than 40 sixes in the tournament so far
 lekin badi jeet ke liye ye sab chota pad gaya he
 Rohit Sharma (5 match-190 runs), Kieron Pollard (5 match-159 runs) and Corey Anderson (4 match-114 runs) remain the big hopes of the team
 in sabake alaava bangalore ke kilaaf jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale unmukt chand (2 match-70 ran) or landal simons (2 match-64 ran) ke alaava ambati raidu (4 match-42 ran) se bhi mumbai kii pari ko sanvaarane kii ummid zarur rahegi
 Like Delhi's batting, Mumbai's bowling is under criticism
 harbhajan ke alaava baaqi sabhi gendbaaz prabhavit karne main naakaam rahe hai
 The teams of Delhi and Mumbai would also like to give their hundred percent in the next match because they do not count in the bottom team

 trinmul congress kii mukhiya he mamata banarti or unki party ke ek saansad hai taapas paal
 The TMC MP on Monday threatened to openly rape CPM women activists
 party kaaryakartaaon ko bhadakaate hue paal ne kaha, 'jaao or khuleam sipiem kii mahila kaaryakartaaon se balaatkaar karo
 Instead of taking action on Pal, the Trinamool Congress distanced itself from this insensitive statement
 trinmul congress ke derek o bryan ne kaha, 'trinmul congress taapas paal ke vichaaron se ittefaq nahin rakhti, unka bayaan nindaneey he
 West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said, "we will investigate why Pal said so
" agar unhone aisa kaha he to party is tarah ke bayanon se sahamat nahin he
 This controversial remark created a ruckus, and the opposition parties including the CPI (M) condemned it and demanded the Lok Sabha speaker to take suo motu cognizance of Pal's remarks and disqualify him from parliament
 paal ne nadiya jile ke choumaha gaanv main apane bhaashan ke ek video main kaha he, ‘kya makapa kaa koi vyakti yahaan he

 i am also a punk
 yadi trinmul congress ke kisi kaaryakarta par kabhi hamalaa hua to main aapke logon ko geli maar duungaa
 If you have bad feelings then stop me
 yah dhyaan rakhana
 'pal said,' Even before this you have shown bullying to me on various occasions
 yadi aapane trinmul congress ke kaaryakartaaon kii maa bahanon kaa apmaan kiya to main apane ladakon ko aapke gharon main chhod duungaa or ve balaatkaar karenge
 i will teach you all a lesson
 ’ paal ne haalanki, balaatkaar ke bare main bole jane se inkaar kiya
 He said, 'I said that i would ask my workers to attack
 ’ trinmul ke rashtriya pravaktaa derek o brian ne kaha ki party paal ke bayaan kaa samarthan nahin karti jo asamvedansheel he
 He said, 'the statement by Mr
 Tapas is very sensitive
 party is baat kaa kisi bhi tarah se samarthan nahin karti he jo unhone kai hafte pehle kahi thi jo aaj tivi channelon par dikhaaya gaya
 CPI (M) leader Vrinda Karat has said that the Lok Sabha speaker should take immediate steps to end Pal's membership
 unki party ke sahakarmi mohammad saleem ne kaha he ki paal kii dhamkee trinmul congress shasit pashchim bengal main ‘araajaktaa’ ko dikhaati he
 Social activist Kiran Bedi has said that the police should register a case against the MP and arrest them
 paal kii tippanee kii congress or rashtriya mahila ayog ne bhi ninda kii he
 Senior Trinamool leader and education minister Partha Chatterjee has said that the party does not support the mp's statement
 unhone kaha, ‘ham aise shabdon kaa kabhi samarthan nahin karte
 He should have avoided using such words
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah dekhnaa chahie ki kin paristhitiyon main aise shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 The opposition must have created such a situation, then such a response would have been given
 ’ These statements have come out in the backdrop of a clash in a village near Tadipatri this week

 The incident of the Berlin Olympics final - Actually, the Berlin Olympic hockey final was to be played between India and Germany on 14 August 1936
 lekin us din lagaataar barish kii vajah se match agle din 15 agast ko khelaa gaya
 Hitler was also present among the 40,000 spectators at Berlin's hockey stadium that day
 half time tak bharat ek gol se aage tha
 After this, Dhyanchand took off his spiked shoes and played an amazing foot empty hockey
 iske baad, to bharat ne ek ke baad ek kai gol daage
 Fellow Dara wrote this in a memoir - played with him in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later Pakistan captain INS Dara wrote in a memoir - After eating six goals, the Germans started playing bad hockey
 unke golkeeper tito warnholtj kii hockey stick dhyanchand ke munh par itani jor se lagi ki unka daant tut gaya
 Having taught the German team such lessons, Dhyanchand, after returning to the ground after initial treatment, instructed the players not to hit a goal anymore, telling the German players how to control the ball
 iske baad khilaadi baar-baar gend ko germany kii di main le jate or phir gend ko back paas kar dete
 The German players could not understand what was happening
 
 
 
 India repaid that defeat India defeated Germany 8–1 in that final
 isamen teen gol dhyanchand ne kiye
 In fact, before the start of the 1936 Olympic Games, the Indian team lost to Germany 4–1 in a practice match
 dhyanchand ne apni aatmakatha ‘gol’ main likhaa, 'main jab tak jivit rahoonga is haar ko kabhi nahin bhuluungaa
 This defeat shook us so much that we could not sleep all night
 'hitler ko bhi du took, kaha- hindustan main khush hoonkaha jaataa he ki is shandaar pradarshan se khush hokar hitler ne unhen khaane par bulaayaa or unase germany kii ore se khilne ko kaha
 In lieu of this, he was also lured into the position of colonel in the strong German army
 lekin dhyanchand ne kaha, 'hindustan meraa vatan he or main vahaan khush hum
 'FACTS-- As Dhyan Singh practiced a lot at night, he was given the nickname' Chand 'by his fellow players
 darasal, unka yah abhyaas chand ke nikal aane par shuru hota tha
 - You will be surprised to know that Kiemjar Dhyanchand had more attachment to wrestling than childhood, not hockey
 -ek baar unhone kaha tha- agar kisi ne mujhase poocha ki vah sabase acha match koun-sa tha, jo maine khelaa, to main kahuunga kalakatta customs or jhaansi hiroj ke bich 1933 kaa beton cap final
 - India defeated America 24–1 and Japan 11–1 during the 1932 Olympics
 dhyanchand ne un 35 golon main se 12, jabaki unke bhai rup singh ne 13 gol daage
 This led to him being called the 'twin of hockey'
 -ek baar jab dhyanchand ek match ke dauraan gol nahin kar paa rahe the, to unhone gol post kii maap par aapatti jataai
 Eventually they were found right
 gol post antarrashtriya niyamon ke tahat nirdhaarit aadhikarik nunatam chaudaai kaa nahin tha
 - Played for India for 22 years and scored 400 international goals
 kaha jaataa he- jab wo khelte the, to maano gend stick par chipak jaati thi
 During a match in Holland, he was seen breaking his stick in fear of being magnetized
 japan main ek match ke dauraan unki stick main gond lage hone kii baat bhi kahi gai
 - Dhyanchand died on 3 December 1979 in Delhi

 During treatment Eastern told doctors that she had miscarried and threw the dead fetus into the dustbin
 court main purvi ke paksh main kaha gaya ki bhrun kii umr 23-24 hafde kii thi, lekin sarkari vakil kaa kahana tha ki bhrun kii umr 25 saptaah kii thi or usne janam lete hi dam tod diya tha
 Even after Eastern's lacquer stated that she had given birth to a dead fetus and not a live baby, the court refused to obey her and accused her of not caring properly for a live child
 adaalat ne iske alaava purvi patel par apane ajanme bachche kii hatya karne ke liye online, jaanaleva davaaiyaan mangavane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 However, it could not be confirmed in the toxicology investigation whether he had taken those medicines or not

 lalu ko andeshaa ho rahaa tha ki kuch gadabad hone vaali he
 West Bengal Governor Kesharinath Tripathi reached Patna on 25 July and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also returned the same day after attending the swearing-in ceremony of President Ram Nath Kovind in Delhi
 isse pehle, nitish ne lalu ko 27 agast ko hone vaali rashtriya janata dal kii raily ke liye apni tasveeron kaa istemaal karne se manaa kar diya tha
 On the other hand, this was the first Bihar visit of Governor Tripathi who was given additional charge of the state on 22 June
 lalu ne apane ek sahaayak ko aadesh diya ki ''pataa karo ki rajyapal sahab kaahe aa rahe hai
 "he immediately told them that the governor had come to meet university officials
 yah baat lalu ke gale nahin utari
 But he did not give much consideration to the subject in organizing the meeting of party legislators and strengthening his case to protest the resignation of Tejashwi Yadav
 rajd kii baithak main lalu kii ichha ko bharpoor samarthan mila
 But there were some things that were restless and in the same trouble, his 3rd of July 26th
 30 baje kii indigo flite chhot gai jo ranchi jane vaali aakhri kralite thi, jahaan unhen agali subah chaara ghotaale ke sambandh main sibiai kii adaalat main pesh hona tha
 The Supreme Court ruled in May that the RJD chief would have to appear separately in all four cases of the fodder scam, in which the Jharkhand High Court released him from the charges two and a half years ago
 phir vahi hua jiskaa unhen dar tha
 After the JD (U) meeting that evening, "younger brother" Nitish informed him that he was resigning
 yah rajd ke mukhiya ke liye sabase lambii raat thi jo ranchi ke raste par bitne vaali thi
 Challenges faced by Lalu After being marginalized for over a decade, the RJD enjoyed a central position in Bihar's political platform again in November 2015
 ab unke haath-paanv phool rahe hai kyonki aaj unke parivaar main aisa koi nahin jiske kandhe kaa sahaara lekar ve pehle kii tarah apane paase phenk saken
 Being caught in the fodder scam, he cannot contest elections himself, wife Rabri has retired in a way and three of her nine children, whom she planned to hand over the torch of her political legacy — Tejapratap, Tejashwi, Joe He is believed to be his successor and eldest daughter Misa Bharti — today in the circle of cases filed against her by CBI, Income Tax Department and Enforcement Directorate (ED) Have been disappointed 243 sadasyon kii majboot bihar vidhansabha main 80 sadasyon ke saath ve rajya kii akeli sabase badi party ke agua hai
 Interestingly, even when the RJD had to contend with only 22 to 4 seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Lalu's corpus was filled with 47 lakh votes, which is about 19 of the total turnout in Bihar
 3 fisadi tha
 Then, even when the RJD fell to its lowest number of 22 seats in the 2010 assembly elections, they received 55 lakh votes
 2014 main lalu ne 72 lakh voton ke saath lagbhag 1,80,000 vot jode, haalanki unhen sirf chaar siten milin
 Lalu's muslim-yadav vote equation has always been a strong vote bank, but it did not win
 lalu ko apane vijay rath par anya or jatiyon kii bhi jarurat hogi
 They are working in the same direction
 nitish ke saath chhodie se pehle bhi lalu basapa netaa mayawati ko apane paale main laane kii koshish main lage the or unhen bihar se rajyasabha bhejne kii peshkash kii thi jisase dalit voton ko lubhaaya ja sake
 RJD leaders believe that Nitish's move towards the NDA has seen a "crowd" growing in the ruling alliance, which may lead some of his caste leaders to Lalu's camp
 lalu kii dilchaspee rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ke netaa kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ko apane kheme main laane kii he, jo nitish or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke hindustani avam morcha ke khilaaf hai
 In Bihar, NDA partners RLAC and Hindustani Awam Morcha have not received any representation in Nitish's new cabinet
 lalu or unki santanon ke kanoonee ladaai main fanse hone kii vajah se unke paas nitish-bhaajapa gathjod ko chunauti dene ke liye vyuharachna karne kaa samay mushkil se mil paaegaa
 It is believed that he may have to go to jail in the fodder scam
 rajd ke ek varisht vidhayak kehete hai, ''1995 main jab sibiai ne chaara ghotaale main lalu ke khilaaf maamla daayar kiya tha, to ve sadak par utar aae the or apaar jan samarthan taiyaar kar liya tha
 But, today Lalu does not have the same support, nor the health and energy to handle adverse situations
 " 2014 main lalu ke dil kaa oparation hua tha
 There is a mountain of difficulties in front of Lalu, there was already a rivalry with the central government, now a huge government has been ruling in Patna
 rajd supremeo kii chintaa vaazib he
 Congress is with Lalu in this dismal scenario
 lihaaja lalu ke liye rashtriya party chunaavon ke mukaable ranneetik kaarnon se mahatvapurn he
 The Congress may have won only two seats out of the total 40 seats in Bihar in the Lok Sabha, but it has a large number of Muslim votes as the bjp's main rival
 jail kaa kismat conectionchand maah jail main bitaana lalu ke liye rajnatik rup se hameshaa phydemand rahaa he
 He won his Lok Sabha election in 1977 only after spending some time in jail during the Emergency
 chaara ghotaale se jude maamalon main july 1997 main samarpan karne ke baad se ve saat baar jail ja chuke hai
 After his release from prison in 1997, he returned home after climbing on an elephant
 2001 main jab unhone ranchi main sibiai adaalat ke saamne samarpan kiya tha tab apane saath hajaar gadipoon kaa kafila le gaye the
 He fiercely used judicial custody to unify his vote bank
 yah thik he ki lalu ke shekhi baghaarne main koi kami nahin ai he, lalu kii pehali praathamikta 27 agast kii raily ko safal bananaa he taaki ve bataa saken ki ve ab bhi aisi takat hai jise nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Law cannot save democracy

 Palanisamy Sadasivam, 64, the newly appointed Chief Justice of India (CJI), sounded like the advice of a veteran judge when he cautioned students at the convocation of Nalasar Law School, Hyderabad, on July 27
 unke shabd the, “jab aap meri umr main pahunchenge to paisa, brands, naam, yahaan tak ki khyaati bhi aapako santosh nahin degi
 The words of the Chief Justice are now being heard
 kisi bhi jaj ne itane kam dinon main itane vivaad nahin khadey kiye hai, jitne ki unhone kiye hai
 The ink of his appointment on July 19 will not be too dry that he was publicly confronted with his predecessor Justice Altamas Kabir
 yah apane aap main abhootpurv ghatana thi
 He had questioned several decisions of the recently retired Chief Justice
 or ab khud unke hi court par ungali uthaai ja rahi haih kya supreme court ko niti-nirmaan ke kshetra main dakhal dena chahie? is baat ko mukhya nyaayadhish se behatar koi or nahin samajhataa hoga kyonki nau maheenon kii choti-si avadhi—26 april, 2014 tak—main unke court ke saamne aise faisle aane vaale hai, jo chunaav or loktantr kii shachlo-surat badal sakate hai
 There are many cases on which the decision can have serious political consequences, from sharing electoral revisions to coalgate investigations, CBI autonomy to 2G cases, chit fund investigations to panchayat elections
 rajnatik tabaka bhi morcha lene ke liye taiyaar he
 On August 12, the government filed a review petition questioning the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the removal of mps and mlas convicted in criminal cases

 Chief Justice Sadasivam has always done something different
 bachapan main bhi unke sapane unke skool ke saathiyon se bilkul alag hote the
 His school was in Kadappanalur village in Erode district in Tamil Nadu
 ve har subah or shaam ko parivaar ke saath khet main kaam karte the

 duraisami yaad karte hai ki ve samay ke behad paband or atyant vinamr the
 He says, "sadashivam used to argue with every angle before convincing the judge why his side was right in the eyes of the law
" nyaayadhish unhen pasand karte the kyonki ve court ko kabhi gumraah nahin karte the
 Even after becoming a judge, his attitude remained the same
 ” supreme court main bhi unke bare main aisi hi raay he
 Known as the "best listener", Sadashivam is very gracious and polite
 ve court main ekadam sahaj rahete hai, sweekruti ke bhav main sir hilaate hai or lacheela rukh rakhte hai
 He is known as a balanced judge, but on July 24 people were shocked when his bench headed by former Chief Justice Altamas Kabir questioned the decisions
 unamem se ek faisla nirmaan company jaiprakash associats ko anek maukon par raahat dene kaa bhi tha
 Kabir's decision resulted in the company losing Rs 100 crore
 kaa dand bharne se batch gai thi
 He was fined by the Himachal Pradesh High Court on charges of giving false information for approval to set up a cement plant
 iske alaava medical or dental shiksha ke liye rashtriya yogyata or pravesh pariksha (eniiti) ke maamle par court kaa faisla li hone ke aaropon ko lekar bhi vivaad khadaa hua
 In this decision of Kabir, private colleges were given full exemption
 iske baad to jaise vaak-yuddh hi shuru ho gaya
 The whole country was left in a shack when on July 26, on national television, Justice Kabir rebuked, "chief Justice Sadasivam should apologize to me
" ”siyaasi tabake ko yah mauka lapakkar hathiyanna hi tha
 On July 29, Union Law Minister Kapil Sibal held a meeting with Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley to discuss the National Judicial Commission
 jetali kehete hai, “hamen paardarshita or eemaandaaree laane ke liye kai tarah ke nyaayik sudhaaron kii jarurat he
 There are many issues ranging from appointments to allegations of corruption and removal of judges
 ”kanoonvid soli psorabji ke anusaar, samasya kii jad yah he ki jajon ne khud ko vaidhata, ajeyata or gopneeyata ke choge main band kar rakhaa he
 In India, judges are appointed by judges in the higher judiciary
 ise (collegium ko) sarvashaktishaalee mana jaataa he, ise bharat main sabase khufia tareeke se “kaam karne vaali sanstha bhi mana jaataa he
 Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution refer to the appointment of judges of the higher judiciary
 psorabji bataate hai: bharat ke raashtrapati ko duusare jajon kii ‘salaah’ se unki niyukti kerani chahie
 The authority to appoint judges is basically in the hands of the executive
 lekin teen faislon kii siries (ise ab 1981, 1993 or 1998 ke teen nyaayadhishon ke maamle kaha jaataa he) main yah salaah puri tarah se “faisle” main badal gai he
 Sorabji says, "the collegium system (a system under which decisions on appointment and transfer of judges form the forum of the Chief Justice of India and the four most senior judges of the Supreme Court
" bhartiya samvidhan main iskaa ullekh nahin he) viksit ho gaya or nyaayik swatantraaa ke siddhant kaa arth yah ho gaya ki sarkaar kii kisi bhi shakha ke paas jajon kii niyukti main koi adhikaar nahin hoga
 "he also believes that this collegium system is responsible for 'indecent public scandal in the judiciary'
 19 march ko gujarat ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii ore se raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or mukhya nyaayadhish ko likhaa gaya 10 pannon kaa patr iskaa udhaaharan he
 In this letter, former Chief Justice Kabir was accused of nepotism
 psorabji kehete hai, “60 saal ke mere anubhav main maine isse ghatiya nokazonk nahin dekhi he
 
 
 This reinforces my belief that the collegium system should be changed
 isamen sarkaar kii bhoomika honi chahie
 “but judicial autonomy is necessary for judicial independence
 yahaan tak ki jis din sadashivam mukhya nyaayadhish bane usee din unhone collegium system ko badale jane kaa virodh kiya thah “main sweekaar karata hum ki isaki kuch khamiyaan hai
 But these gaps can be overcome
 ”unhone yah bhi kaha ki maujuuda system ko badalanaa sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main he, lekin koi bhi badlaav samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye hi kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir supreme court kii badi bench is par vichaar kar sakati he
 Not only this, he has advocated a two-year fixed tenure system so that the Chief Justice can decide and implement judicial reforms
 britain kii uniwarsity of varavik main kanoon ke professor upendra bakshi kehete hai, “nyaaypalika or netaaon ke bich takaraav to hona hi tha
 "since 2010, high-profile judges have created a national agenda: hearing major cases of corruption, questioning investigative agencies and exposing discrepancies in governance
 aise jajon ne janata ke mood ke anusaar kaam kiya
 The public wanted corruption to be eliminated at the highest level
 haalanki is bich “nyaaypalika ke bekaabu” hone kii bhi charchaa hoti rahi
 But they did not care
 bakshi kehete hai, “jab kanoonvid hi ek-duusare ke aacharan par sawaal uthaane lagen to yah mahatvapurn loktantric sanstha kii chhavi ke liye acchhee baat nahin he
 “the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice Sadashivam is united in the case of attack on the political class — judges are looting the headlines by condemning the perks and benefits that the leaders receive

 If the constitution needs amendment, does the government have the necessary majority in both houses? Or will the judiciary win in this case? Sadashivam is considered to be a smoker of work and continues to work for a long time, but that will not be enough to deal with the challenges faced in his career as a judge

 aakhir sajeesh puri ho gai
 Prabhakaran approved the plan of Rajiv Gandhi's death
 plan ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari chaar logon ko saunpi gai
 Baby subrahmanyam-ltte ideologue, it had a hideout for the attackers
 muthuraja-prabhakaran kaa khaas, hamalaavaron ke liye sanchaar or paise kii jimmedaari is par thi
 Murugan - the explosives expert, the terror guru, arranged the necessary items and money for the attack
 shivarasana-littey kaa jasoos, visphotak visheshgy, rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii puri jimmedaari isi par thi
 Baby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja arrived in Chennai in early 1991, after Kamadunia's most feared terrorist Prabhakaran took the orders to kill Rajiv on the plan started in 1991
 inke jimme tha behad ahm or shuruuaati kaam
 Baby and Muthuraj had to prepare people in Chennai who, despite being unaware of the purpose, help the death squads
 khaastaur par rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ke liye hatya se pehle rukne kaa ghar den or hatya ke baad chhipane kaa thikaana
 Focusbaby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja reached different Shubha News photo agency in Chennai on different targets
 agency kaa maalik shubha subrahmanyam ilam samarthak tha
 Shubha Subrahmanyam had the help of both of them before Baby and Muthuraja arrived
 shubha ko sajeesh ke liye local saport muhaiyaa karana tha
 Arriving here, Baby and Muthuraja started working differently according to their respective targets
 bhagyanathan ko jaal main fansaayababy subrahmanyam ne sabase pehle shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale bhagyanathan ko apane changul main fansaaya
 Nalini, who is serving a sentence in the Rajiv murder case, is the sister of this Bhagyanathan who used to work in a printing press
 bhagyanathan or nalini kii maa nurse thi
 The nurse mother had to vacate the house she got from the hospital at the same time
 mushkil halaat main ghire bhagyanathan or nalini ko aatanki baby ne paise or madad ke jhaanse main liya
 Baby sold a printing press to Bhagyanathan cheaply
 isse parivaar sadak par aane se batch gaya
 Nalini and Bhagyanathan in turn became Baby's pawns
 sajeesh kaa pehla charan tha samarthakon kaa network bananaa jo shaatir dimaagon main band sajeesh ko dhire-dhire anjaam tak pahunchane main madadgaar sabit hon par bina kuch jane
 Baby Subrahmanyam was setting up safe havens to live in Chennai, while Muthuraja was very viciously picking people for his brutal plot
 chennai kii shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale in shaitanon ke liye vardaan ban gaye the
 It was from here that Muthuraja selected two photographers Ravi Shankaran and Haribabu
 muthuraja ne dilaai naukareeravishankaran or haribabu dono shubha news photocopy agency main bataur photographer kaam karte the
 Haribabu was fired
 muthuraja ne haribabu ko vigyaneshwar agency main naukari dilaai
 Called a man named Balan from Sri Lanka and made Haribabu's protégé
 isse haribabu ko kaaphi paisa milane laga or uskaa jhukaav muthuraja kii taraf badhane laga
 Furious against Rajiv Gandhi, Muthuraja, under the burden of sorrow, provoked Haribabu against Rajiv Gandhi that if he wins the 1991 Lok Sabha elections and comes to power, the Tamils will suffer further
 rajeev kii hatya ke liye sajeesh kii ek ek eent jodi ja rahi thi
 Sitting in Sri Lanka, Murugan meanwhile sent Jai Kumaran and Robert Payas to Chennai
 ye donon purur ke saviri nagar ekstansion main ruke
 The LTTE bomb expert Arivayuya Jayakumaran's brother-in-law LTTE bomb expert Arivu Perulibalan had been hiding since 1990
 in donon ko srilanka se chennai bhejne kaa makasad tha arse se chupchaap pade computer ejeeniyar or electronic export ariveyu perulibalan ko sajeesh main shaamil karnaa taaki wo hatya kaa aujaar bam bana sake
 Later, Porur's house became the headquarters of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination plan
 yaheen se chalakar puri sajeesh shreeperambdur tak pahunchi thi
 Murugan's entry into the conspiracy was also creating a huge hatred against Rajiv Gandhi in the minds of every person who joined
 unhen pataa tha ki bhayankar nafrat ke bina bheeshan ghinauni sajeesh anjaam tak nahin pahonchegi
 When Baby and Muthuraja added their four people, Murugan's entry into the plot took place
 murugan ne chennai pahunch kar bahut raftaar main sajeesh ko anjaam kii ore laane kii koshishen tej kin
 Jayakumaran and Pius at the behest of Murugan
 nalini-bhagyanathan-baby-muthuraja ke thikaane par pahunch gaye
 anti-rajiv Gandhi sentiments began to fill the minds of the people
 nalini rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf puri tarah taiyaar ho gayi thi
 'satanic Forces' helped Brainwash, a book published in the printing press in the printing press, where Satanic Forces played an important role in his brainwash
 brinwash ke saath murugan ne hatyaron kii nakli pahchaan taiyaar karne ke liye jayakumaran or paayas kii madad se farji driving license banwaaya
 Hide-and-seek hideoutmurugan, Muthuraja and Baby together find three safeguards hideouts in Chennai
 araviyu ke taur par ek bam banane vaala taiyaar tha
 Hate of Nalini Padma and Bhagyanathan was ready against Rajiv
 shubha subrahmanyam jaisaa aadmi muhaiyaa karaane vaala taiyaar tha
 Now a message was sent to Sivarasan
 march kii shuruuaat main wo samudr ke raste chennai pahunchaa
 He stopped at Payas's house in the same area of porur
 maanav bam kii talahporur hi rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii sajeesh kaa controlroom ban gaya
 As soon as Shivarasan reached Porur, the trap of the conspiracy of the forests of Jaffna was completed
 shivarasana ne kaman apane haath main le lee
 Baby and Muthuraj were sent back to Sri Lanka
 chennai main nalni, murugan or bhagyanathan ke saath shivarasana ne maanavbam khoja par wo nahin mila
 Sivarasan checked Arivayu Peruli Balan's bomb design, Sivarasan himself was a good explosive expert
 sari taiyaari ko mukammal dekh maanavbam ke itanjam main shivarasana phir samudr ke raste jafana waapas gaya vahaan wo prabhakaran se mila
 He told Prabhakaran that Manavam is not available in India
 isapar prabhakaran ne shivarasana kii chacheri bahanon dhanu or shubha ko uske saath bharat ke liye ravaanaa kar diya
 Sivarasan arrived in Chennai in early April with three locations, a murder plot, Dhanu and Shubha
 dhanu or shubha ko wo nalini ke ghar le gaya
 Murugan was already present here
 shivarasana ne behad shaatir tareeke se paayas- jayakumaran-bam dijainer arivu ko inase alag rakhaa or khud porur ke thikaane main rahata rahaa
 He instructed everyone from time to time to take correct action
 ab chennai ke teen thikaanon main rajeev gandhi hatyakand kii sajeesh chal rahi thi
 Sivarasan asked bomb expert Aivu to make a bomb that could be tied to the woman's waist without revealing the target
 shivarasana ke kehane par arivu ne ek aisi belt dizin kii jisamen chah ardex bhare grenade jamaaye ja sake
 Eighty grams of Seafour audix were loaded in each grenade
 har grenade main do mili meter ke do hajaar aath sau spellinter hon
 All grenades were added parallel with the help of silver wire
 circuit ko puraa karne ke liye do switch lagaae gaye
 One of these ready-made bombs was to prepare the switch bomb and the other was to detonate and a 9 mm battery was installed to charge the entire bomb
 grenade main jamaa kiye gaye sprinter kam se kam visphotak main 5000 meter pratisecond kii raftaar se baahar nikalate yani har sprinter ek goli ban gaya tha
 The bomb was designed in such a way that the target could not survive if the explosion was as low as the RDX and the same happened
 rajeev gandhi ke kareeb tha shivarasanab shivarasana ke haath main bam bhi tha or bam ko anjaam tak pahunchane vaali maanavbam dhanu bhi
 It was just a matter of Rajiv Gandhi, but before that he wanted to try his conspiracy by hammering
 aaj tak ke paas 1991 main aamchunaavon ke dauraan chennai ke marina bich main hui raily kaa video he
 In this video, Sivarasan can be seen at a distance of just 25-30 feet from his target Rajiv Gandhi
 jayalalita or rajeev kii is raily main shivarasana rajeev kii suraksha kaa jayja lene pahunchaa tha
 Here he realized the flaws of Rajiv's public meeting and poor security, but one-day Jack Sivarasan did not stop here
 is raily ke anubhav ko pakkaa karne ke liye wo ek or siyaasi raily main maanavbam dhanu ko saath lekar pahunchaa
 Final Reiki at the rally On 12 May 1991, shivarasan-dhanu performed the final Reiki at the rally of former PM VP Singh and DMK supremo Karunanidhi
 tiruvallur ke arkonam main hui is raily main dhanu veepi singh ke behad paas tak pahunchi usne unke pair bhi chhue
 Just did not press the button of the bomb
 purv pradhanmantri veepi singh kii raily main suraksha kaa str rajeev kii suraksha ke baraabar na sahi to kam bhi nahin tha
 But the vicious intentions of Sivarasan and Dhanu were successful
 isse shivarasana ke hausale buland ho gaye or use apana plan kaamyaab hota dikhne laga
 On 21 May, Rajiv Gandhi's election was a round of elections; Rajiv Gandhi's meeting was fixed on 21 May in Sriperumbudur
 shivarasana ne palak jhapakate hi tay kar liya ki 21 ko hi sajeesh puri hogi
 On the night of 20, Shivarasan reached the house of Nalini with a newspaper advertising the rally and it was decided that now the plot will be completed only on 21st
 hamale se pehle dekhi thi filmanlini ke ghar 20 may kii raat dhanu ne pehali baar suraksha agenciyon ko chakma dene ke liye chashma pahana
 Shubha got Dhanu to practice by wearing a belt and complete preparations for how to carry out the conspiracy in Sriperumbudur
 sabhi puri tarah shant or makasad ke liye taiyaar the
 On the night of 20 May, everyone watched the film together and slept
 subah hui to paanch log shivarasana, dhanu, shubha, nalini or haribabu sajeesh ko puraa karne ke liye taiyaar the
 The big bang and all was over was May 21, 1991
 madras se kareeb 40 kimi dur tamilnadu ke shreeperambdur main raily kii gahamagahami thi
 Rajiv Gandhi's arrival was delayed
 baar-baar elaan ho rahaa tha ki rajeev kisi bhi vakt raily ke liye pahunch sakate hai
 The plot that had been brewing for the last six months was very close to its end
 shreeperambdur main rajeev gandhi sabha liye pahunche
 There was a statue of Indira Gandhi just a short distance away from the stage
 jahaan rajeev gandhi ne pehle maalyarpan kiya or phir manch kii taraf bad gaye
 He was meeting his supporters near the barricades
 ek mahila haathon main haar lekar rajeev tak pahunchnaa chaahati thi
 But could not reach there because of the crowd
 tabhi rajeev gandhi kii najar us par padi
 They indicated him to come forward
 wo mahila rajeev gandhi ke paas pahunchi or unhen chandan kaa haar pahanaaya
 Then he bent down to touch Rajiv's feet and then a sharp explosion occurred at 10
20
 har taraf dhuaan or aag thi
 Rajiv Gandhi had left this world forever
 har taraf maut kaa matam tha
 Pieces of human body were lying here
 sab khatm ho chukaa tha
 Shivarasan escapes to Chennai soon after Rajiv's killer blasts
 nalini or sudhaa usase chennai main hi aakar mili
 There Sivarasan tells Sudha that Haribabu was killed, but his camera is lying there
 shivarasana ne sundaram ko haribabu kaa camera maukey se udaane kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 Sundaram tried hard but failed and then the photographs captured in that camera roll gave the clues to the security agencies, who rushed Rajiv's killers behind bars
 rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar nalini shriharan, murugan urf shriharan, periyavalan urf arivu, ravichandran, santhan or jayakumar pichley 28 saal se jail main sajaa bhugat rahe hai

 kangaaroon ke liye jari test siries main jasprit bumraah (jasprit Bumrah) or mohammad shami (mohammed Shami) kitni badi dehshat bane hue hai, yah sabhi ne dekha he

 com / vbvimdwpzy Please tell that both these seamers are among the top five bowlers in the world in terms of highest wicket taking in the year 2018
 jahaan jasprit bumraah abhi tak (melbern main australia ke khilaaf tisare test seppehale tak) bumraah is saal 9 test maichon me 45 wicket apni jholii main jamaa kar chuke hai, to shami ne bhi 12 test maichon main 45 wicket chatkaaye hai
 Talking about the other bowlers of India, Ishant Sharma scored 39 and R
 in 11 Tests
 aswin ne 10 test maichon me 38 wicket liye hai
 The combined impact of these bowlers was that India did the feat for the first time in 2018, which Indians could never do in their Test history
 aapako bataa den ki yah saal 2002 tha, jab bhartiya gendbaajon ne ek calendar year main 241 wicket chatkaaye the
 Earlier Indian bowlers took 249 wickets in 1979, almost 39 years ago, but this year India has touched the figure of 250
 or aisa pehali baar hua he
 And if India managed to do so for the first time, it was followed by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami among the top five bowlers in the world in 2018

 The BCCI has denied giving notice to players after an uproar in a pub in St
 Lucia
 board kaa kahana he ki westeindies main aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 Earlier it was reported that six players of Team India were reported to have scrambled with Indian fans in a pub in St
 Lucia in the West Indies
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isaki shuruyaat kahasuni ke saath hui thi
 After the matter came to Madia, the BCCI has now issued notice to 6 players involved in this shameful incident
 yakeen karnaa mushkil he lekin khabar yahi he ki westeindies main saint lushia main super 8 ke ahm mukaable main srilanka ke khilaaf mili karaari haar ke baad usee raat yani 11 may kii raat team india ke kuch khilaadi ek restaraan main pahunchate hai
 On the one hand, in India, where millions of fans are hurt by the players' poor sports, they are shocked, while losing these players probably makes no sense
 haar kii raat hi unke liye shaayad mouj masti zyada myne rakhti he
 The names of Ashish Nehra, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and Rohit Sharma are appearing in these players
 ye restaraan thik us hotel ke saamne he jahaan team india ko tehraaya gaya tha
 According to the sources, the story of Indian fans started with Ashish Nehra and the matter went from scrimmage to scuffle
 kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki hathapayee main ashish nehra kii shart bhi fat gai thi
 Then Yuvraj Singh also joined this shock
 kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki maamla kaabo se baahar hota ja rahaa tha lekin vahaan maujuud logon ke bichbachaav se maamla shant hua
 It does not matter whether the players were at fault or the Indian fans present there
 lekin haar ke baad bhi wo bhi usee raat kisi pub yaa restaraan main mouj masti ke liye maujuud rahanaa kya jaij he
 The matter is even more shocking because before this, Team India has spoiled the name of the team after some defeats
 haalanki 11 may kii raat kii is ghatana kaa yuvaraj ne twitor par khandan kiya he lekin hindustan pahunchane par khilaadiyon ko apni harakat kaa jawaab desh ke saamne dena hi hoga

 Meerut's triple murder mystery revolving around gossip and hatred has now shifted to a man who last spoke to Riya before the murder
 is cese main 28 saal kii riya ko hi sabase zyada berahami se maaraa gaya
 Before the murder, the person who spoke to him, when the police took out his mobile phone details, it was found out that the mobile phone was bought on fake documents
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki is tripal murder kaa asli gunahagaar koun he?jaankaree ke mutabik, shanivaar ko meerut main chandrashekhar gupta, uski patni punam or riya kaa katl hua tha
 While the murderer had strangled Chandrasekhar and Poonam, Riya had stabbed him several knives one after the other
 riya kii belibase laash ghar kii bistar padi thi
 He also had condoms and other objectionable things
 ghar main chaay ke teen cap bhi mili
 Seeing this entire scene of crime, the police suspect that the slaughter racket could be the reason behind the murder and the hatred that took place in the same sequence
 is cese kii tafteesh kar rahi police ne jab riya kii phone detail khangaali to use ek nayaa jhatka laga
 The police came to know that Riya was talking to someone on her phone till four and a half hours before the murder
 iske baad uskaa phone band ho gaya
 It is suspected that the killing took place between four and a half to five in the evening, but after this, when the police took out the details of the number of the person who called Riya, it was found that his phone connection was taken on the fake name and identity
 kaatil ne behad gahari sajeesh rachi he
 Riya's husband is on the radar of the police In this story-telling story of triple murder, Riya's husband Pushpendra alias Jeetendra has been suspecting the police since day one
 mote taur par is shaq kii do ahm vajahen hai
 The first is that Pushpendra's relationship with Riya is not said to be very good
 doosraa ye ki pushpendra hi wo shaks he, jiske saath riya ko aakiri baar jinda dekha gaya tha
 In such a situation, he is bound to be on the radar of the police
 kuch inhen vajahon se police pushpendra se lagaataar poochtacha bhi kar rahi he
 But his hands are still empty
 philhal pulisia jaanch jari he
 Riyabi came out on the pretext of beauty parlor, saying that before the incident came to the house of Chandrashekhar daily, Riya left her husband telling her to go to the beauty parlor
 yani katl se kuch der pehle tak wo riya ke saath tha
 But the story inside is that his relationships were not very good with Riya
 aksar donon ke bich kahasuni or marpet hua karti thi
 Apparently Pushpendra was telling himself to be innocent but when the police took the help of electronic surveillance to prove his point, the evidence started appearing in favor of Pushpendra, the suspect in this case
 media kii samaaj main kaaphi mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 The media is also called the fourth pillar of the democratic system, because its responsibility is to bring out the problems of the country and the people, as well as to monitor the functioning of the government
 lekin pichley kuch dinon main media kii karypranali or rukh par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai
 The question is, is the media changing? Are such questions justified on the moral side of the media? isamen do raay nahin ki media ke kaam karne ke tareeke or charitra main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 But how true and how wrong this change is, it is difficult to tell
 aazaadee se pehle kii tulana main dekhen tomedia ke swaroop main ek buniyadi fark aayaa he
 Earlier media did not get independence like today
 james augustus ne bharat kaa pehla samachar patr 'da bengal gajet' 1780 main shuru kiya tha
 In exchange for criticizing the wife of the then Governor General Warren Hastings, he was sentenced to four months in jail, as well as a fine of five hundred rupees
 tab angrej apni haisiyat se press ko sanchalit karte the
 But a lot has changed since independence
 press ko aazaadee mili
 The distances between the government and the press have reduced considerably
 aazaadee ke samay bharat main kareeb teen sau samachar patr prakashit ho rahe the
 But now their number is more than thirteen thousand
 jahaan tak media kii aazaadee kaa sawaal he, duniya main ek tihaai se zyada log aise deshon main rahete hai jahaan media apni disha tay karne ke liye swatantra nahin he
 According to the reports of surveys, India ranks one hundred and forty-fifth in terms of media freedom
 haalanki yah akalan sidhe-sidhe bharosa karne laayak nahin lagata
 Looking a little closer, it seems that there is no serious threat to media freedom in India at the moment
 doordarshan or aakashvani jaisi sarkari sansthaaon ko chhod den to kisi bhi nijee channel par sarkaar kaa dabadabaa nahin rahata
 Here, if we talk about other countries, Finland, Norway and Netherlands are at the top of media freedom
 is kasuti par iritria, uttar korea or syria jaise desh sabase nichle paaydaan par hai
 In these countries, the media has no freedom to give news or talk on issues according to its own
 vahaan media ek tarah se sarkaar ke adheen kaam karata he
 The situation can be gauged from the fact that most journalists in Eritrea are in jail
 sawaal yah uthta he ki media kii aazaadee ko kaise aanka jaae
 The Constitution of India guarantees the right of expression under Article 19 (1)
 press kii swatantraaa usee kaa hissaa he, isliye isaki alag se charchaa nahin he
 After all, what does media freedom mean? Should we just consider the government to be out of control? The government generally does not control the media
 lekin kya media sarkaar or corporate jagat ke swaarth ke liye kaam karata he? Indeed, some questions are probably responsible for the questions being raised on the media today
 agar media ke dabaav main kaam karne kii baat par vichaar karen to yah saaf hona abhi baaki he ki aakhir vah dabaav kis tarah kaa he, or kya uskaa asar vishay-vastu par bhi pad rahaa he! media ke kawarej ko lekar aaj sabase zyada sawaal raajnneetikon kii ore se uthaae ja rahe hai
 Some politicians want to run the media in their own style
 agar media unke paksh main sakaaratmak khabaren dikhaata he to use ve acha kehete hai or aisa nahin hone par media ko kathghare main khadaa karne lagate hai
 In this case, Arvind Kejriwal went ahead and even asked to send journalists to jail in a hurry
 sach yah he ki agar media ke jariye sabase zyada phayda kisi ko hua to vah arvind kejariwal or unki party ko
 In the last one year, the media has campaigned the Aam Aadmi Party and its leaders the most
 anna ke andolan se lekar ab tak media ne in logon ko hero banaaya he
 Kejriwal says that the media keeps on promoting Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party
 lekin 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad agar media ne kisi par sabase zyada sawaal uthaae or sabase zyada kisi kii aalochana kii to ve narendra modi or unki sarkaar he
 The media gave a lot of space to the corruption and inflation of the Congress
 baharhaal, arvind kejariwal ab yah safai de chuke hai ki unki pratikriya kuch channelon ke sandarbh main thi
 The question is, is Kejriwal's reaction not political like this? Why do politicians remember the media more at the time of elections
 desh main or bahut sari samasyaayein hai, unhen lekar rajaneta media ko kyon nahin gherte hai? kejariwal hi nahin, duusari tamaam partiyon ke netaa bhi media kii aalochana karte rahete hai
 There is no doubt that there is some truth in the questions raised on the media
 kya media apni takat kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he? 'ped news' kii jo baat uthaai ja rahi he, usamen kitni sachai he? kya media ke apane daayre main bhi bhrashtachar he? jo ho, har kisi ko ek hi taraazoo main taulnaa shaayad thik nahin he
 There are many news channels and newspapers that work for the larger interest of society by trying to maintain the image of the media through their honest reporting and analysis
 aaj print or electronic, media ke donon madhyamon ke saamne apni vishwasaneeyata bachaane kii bahut badi chunauti he
 In the era of the Internet, their popularity has decreased
 print or electronic media kii bhoomika or un par nirbharta lagaataar kam hoti ja rahi he
 Today, more than ten percent people in India are using the Internet and its scope is gradually increasing
 internet ke jariye logon ke paas khabaren jaldi pahunch jaati hai
 Social media is also playing an important role in this matter
 duusari ore, asia se zyada pashchimi deshon main samachar patron kii haalat kharaab he
 While the spread of newspapers has decreased in Western countries, there has been an increase in Asia
 china or bharat jaise deshon main duniya ke sabase zyada log rahete hai, lekin yahaan internet tak pahunch ke maamle main abhi kaaphi lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 Asia is considered the 'king' of the newspaper market
 duniya kii sau se bhi zyada behtareen khabaren upree asia main chhaapi jaati hai
 Print media is also becoming more and more computerized
 samasya yah he ki digital se zyada phayda nahin hota he, kyonki iske jariye vaanchit prachaar milanaa sambhav nahin he
 The condition of electronic media along with print is also quite poor
 channelon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he or log ek channel se duusare channel kii ore rukh kar rahe hai
 This is the reason that today trps are causing stress for channels
 haalanki tiarapy ke barakes channelon kii gananaa or gunvattta ko lekar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Media coverage has changed significantly
 kai baar aisa lagata he ki media vyakti-kendrit ho chukaa he
 Attempts are being made to entice the audience by serving the program with some theatricality and exaggeration
 aisa lagata he ki media apni saamaajik jimmedaari se bhaag rahaa he
 Social news is less visible
 aajkal tivi channelon par netaa hi dikhaai dete hai
 The speeches and statements of the leaders on TV are filled with news, while in the newspapers, advertisements are seen more and the news is less visible
 media kii pahunch kaa vistaar hua he, par yahi baat kawarej ke bare main nahin kahi ja sakati
 He seems untouched by the problems of the people of the villages
 desh main bahut sari samasyaayein hai, lekin medio ko shaayad unase koi sarokaar nahin he
 Whether we talk about the suicides of farmers or the atrocities or crimes committed by women, the media is either miserly or does not have the necessary sensitivity to place such cases in the media
 phir ek or chintajanak pahuul media kaa doharaa ravaiya he; vah sirf shaharon kii ghatnaon or samasyaon ko lekar gambhir dikhataa he
 Even in the cities, the problems of the middle class bother him more
 masalan, barish se ghante-do ghante bhi yatayaat jam ho jaae to tivi channelon par cheekh-pukaar shuru ho jaati he, magar jin ilaakon ke log barason se pani ke liye tarasate rahete hai unki sud nahin lee jaati
 It is not that media does not do any good
 desh main hue bade-bade ghotaalon ko media ne hi uthaaya he, chaahe ve rashtramandal khelon ke aayojan se jude rahe hon yaa 2-ji or koyale ke aabantan se sambandhit
 Many such news channels and newspapers are conscious of the problems of the society and have also started some special campaigns
 kanya bachaao, pahaad bachaao yaa nirbhaya cond jaise maamalon main hamane media ko nae rup main dekha he
 It was because of his activism and outspokenness that the civil outrage over the Nirbhaya incident took the form of a mass movement and finally the anti-sexual violence laws were amended
 haalanki birbhum samuhik balaatkaar maamle main media main jitani khabaren aarin, ve bataati hai ki media bhi shaayad vargeey agrahon se sanchalit hota he
 The media and those news questions were raised regarding this
 media ke aise rup ko dekh kar joseph stallin kaa ek uddhran yaad aata he- 'sirf ek maut shokat he or asankhya mrityu aankada!' Due to the non-commencement of construction work in all the projects of Amrapali, Nephova has filed a writ petition against the Amrapali Group in the Supreme Court

 Our camera team was checking both the mikes that a car entered the Girnar apartment without a siren
 dhire se koi kahata he ki arvind kejariwal aa gaye
 Vibhav, Manish Sisodia and Deepak also get out of the car and the interview starts with Namaskar
 dinabhar kii raajnneetik gatividhiyon kii thakaan arvind ke chehre par saaf dikh rahi he
 Adjacent to Ghaziabad is the area of kaushambi where Arvind Kejriwal's old house is
 kaushambi ke saare apartmenton kii maayusi hameshaa mujhe pareshaan karti he
 Gray colored buildings exist like the 'gray area' of politics outside which the seller of water on the track said that eighty percent of the households people buy water and drink it daily
 maheene kaa hazaar rupaya pine ke pani par kharch karte hai
 The hair of the people of Kaushambi has started falling significantly from this water
 sudhir panivala to kisi doctor kii tarah bataae ja rahaa tha, lekin meri nazar kaushambi kii maayoos or benur imaaraton par tiki thim
 Why do these apartments seem so desolate and darkly dark
 kya logon ne kam raushnee main jeena sikh liya he
 Certainly Kaushambi, a major district of ancient India, will not fade in this way
 kair intervyuu hone laga
 Arvind Kejriwal started avoiding any kind of attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 baar baar poocha lekin taalte rahe ki unka muqabla dilli main bijepi ke mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar se he na ki narendra modi se
 i kept asking repeatedly that BJP is going to land in Delhi only in the name of Modi
 isi ranneeti par wo ek loksabhaa or do vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeet gai he
 Arvind Kejriwal's reply felt that he was not ready to let the issue of Delhi go into bjp's hands by making Modi an issue
 wo har sawaal ke jawaab ko 49 dinon kii uplabdhiyon or bhrashtachar ke mudde ke aas-paas rakhana chaahate hai
 In our conversation, do not forget to tell us repeatedly what a great achievement that not one of our mlas has broken
 agar hamaari party majboot nahin hoti to inamen se koi bhi tut chukaa hota or bijepi sarkaar bana chuki hoti
 But our legislators have rejected the politics of money
 isi se meraa aglaa sawaal ban gaya ki sansaadhan, vigyaapan or sanghathan ke maamle main aap bijepi ke mukaable kahin nahin thaharti he to kaise ladegi or ladegi to kaise tikegi
 Arvind immediately accepted that we have no money
 or agar hamane jamaa bhi kiye to kitne kar lenge
 Twenty crores were reached last time, many will be thirty crores but will BJP contest in thirty crores
 mujhe pataa he ki bijepi ke paas paise or sansaadhan kii koi kami nahin he
 Arvind Kejriwal admitted that this time his fight is only with BJP
 congress ladaai main nahin he
 i could not be satisfied with all the answers given to him about corruption
 meri daleel yah thi ki dilli ne is mudde ko chhod diya he
 She is no longer as passionate about Jan Lokpal or Lokpal as she was a year ago
 arvind kejariwal sahamat nahin the
 He says that the common man is still struggling with corruption from municipal corporations to hospitals
 ve ek baar phir janalokapal or bhrashtachar ko hi mudda banaayenge or paanch saal ke liye mauka maangenge
 From his answer it seemed that this time indeed the common man has hope from the section which is in the lower to middle part of the society
 arvind ko yah ahsaas ho chalaa he ki is ladaai main madhyamvarg ko apane paksh main laana ek chunauti kaa kaam hoga
 When asked again and again, they say that this time the middle class of Delhi will have to decide whether they are against or in support of incidents like Bawana or Trilokpuri
 nafrat kii raajnneeti ke kilaaf use hi aage aana hoga
 Arvind is now a politician
 nahin maanate ki is baar unki party ke liye karo yaa maro kii sthiti he
 It is said that his party's roots have deepened in the last four months
 gali se lekar vyapaar mandal tak main unka sanghathan bana he
 They believe that the way their mlas have rejected the politics of horse trading, it does not seem that the existence of the Aam Aadmi Party will depend on the outcome of this election
 sawaal khatm hone lage the
 i wanted to try to see his attitude on Narendra Modi again and again
 lekin jab intervyuu khatm hone ke baad unke ghar chaay pine gaya to kaushambi kii imaaraton kii maayusi phir gherne lagi
 Looking at the big trains in the parking lot, it does not seem that there is any shortage of resources among the people here
 yahi to sawaal he ki ye log apane ilaake kii surat kyon nahin badal pate
 Now we were inside his house with Arvind Kejriwal
 apni patni se papad maang kar khaane lage
 Got busy on the phone
 isse pehle ek baar or gaya tha
 Between then and now, he has been the former Chief Minister from Chief Minister
 lekin dobaaraa ghar jas kaa tas bas chukaa tha
 The goods also looked the same
 daawey ke saath to nahin kah saktaa lekin saal bhar baad ghar jaakar laga ki aisa kuch bhi khaas nahin he jisase lage ki ghar badal gaya he
 Tea-drinking strategies began to be discussed
 arvind ab pehle kii tarah uchak kar nahin bolte
 Were being listened to
 jawaab bhale nahin mila lekin sawaal tairta hua zarur nazar aayaa ki is baar kii ladaai nirnaayak he
 Its difficult
 pataa nahin kya hoga kaa sawaal tair rahaa tha
 Politicians never accept
 ve hameshaa kehete hai ki ladaai ke liye taiyaar hai
 Accusing Nitish Kumar of adopting double standards on corruption, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan said that his 'mask' came off after a CBI officer in a Ranchi court told him to take money from the Bihar Chief Minister in the fodder scam

 This incident indicates his involvement in corruption from the beginning

 with HSBC Bank in Geneva
 " It is said that the existence of the company (M / s Tailwinds Limited) was fully disclosed by various departments of the Government of India and the Department of Information Technology had given satisfactory answers to the questions raised
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, "naresh goyal ke naam se swiss bank main koi khaataa nahin he, jaisaa ki aarope lagaaya gaya he
 To say that he hid countless money in Swiss accounts is a blatant lie
 " Meanwhile, the BJP asked the central government that its party first seeks to bring back the black money hidden abroad and that it conduct an inquiry into the operation of HSBC Bank in India
 arvind kejariwal dwaara congress-nit centre sarkaar par videshon main kalaadhan chhipaane waalon ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaae jane ke turant baad bhaajapa pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne bhi sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki usne kaledhan par niyantran ke liye ab tak kya kiya
 The comments sitaraman ne kaha, "yadi sarkaar yah nahin bataa sakati ki kaledhan ke khilaaf usne kya kadam uthaae to ham maang karte hai ki isi kram main vah echesbisi maamle kii jaanch karaae

 " kaha gaya he ki company (messors telvinds limited) ke astitv ko lekar bharat sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon ne puri tarah khulaasa kiya tha or soochna praudyogiki vibhaag ne jo sawaal kiye the, unke santoshprad jawaab die the
 "there is no account in Swiss bank in the name of Naresh Goyal, as alleged," the statement said
 aise main yah kahana ki unhone swiss khaaton main anginat dhan chhupaae hai, saraasar jhooth he

 Soon after Arvind Kejriwal accused the Congress-led central government of protecting black money hides abroad, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman also questioned the government about what it had done so far to control black money
 tippaniyan Sitharaman said, "if the government cannot tell what steps it takes against black money, then we demand that in this sequence, it should get the HSBC case investigated
 " Referring to the Congress meeting held in Surajkund, Haryana near Delhi, he said, "we remind the Congress that it promised to bring back black money in the manifesto in 100 days which it has not completed till date

 tippaniyan Sitharaman said, "if the government cannot tell what steps it takes against black money, then we demand that in this sequence, it should get the HSBC case investigated
 " Referring to the Congress meeting held in Surajkund, Haryana near Delhi, he said, "we remind the Congress that it promised to bring back black money in the manifesto in 100 days which it has not completed till date
" " Meanwhile, the BJP asked the central government that its party first seeks to bring back the black money hidden abroad and that it conduct an inquiry into the operation of HSBC Bank in India

 " oparation range haath
 
 
 Aaj Tak has done a major sting operation
 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke har sarkari mahakme main rishwatakhori or bhrashtachar kaa khulaa khel chal rahaa he
 Be it Jal Board or Power House, Sales Tax Department or Cooperative Society, the disclosure will also be of Transport Department
 ajtak kii special investigeshan team ke 'oparation range haath' main jo sach saamne aayaa he, use dekh-sunakar aap bhi dang rah jaaenge
 The demon of corruption has resurfaced as soon as Arvind Kejriwal goes to government
 bade-bade vibhaagon ke afasar ghoose kii rakam se apni jeb garam kar rahe hai
 Whether it is the impact of Kejriwal or the scare of the sting operation, but the ground reality is that when the government of Kejriwal was there, the game of green notes from the water board to the power house, and from the power station to the office, should be stopped for a few days
 i went
 sach yah bhi he ki noton ke khel ke saath-saath kai logon ke kaam bhi band ho gaye the
 Here on 14 February, as soon as Kejriwal divorced the chair, the brokers became silver in the city
 artio offis se lekar bijligharon ke baahar dallalon kii bheed lagani shuru ho gai
 Whether it is to get a license or to reduce the electricity bill or it is a matter of sending a water tanker to the house, take the money out of your pocket and get it done right away
 kejariwal kii sarkaar jane ke baad desh kii rajdhani main ajtak kii special investigeshan team ne afasaron or karmchaariyon ke imaan or ikbaal kaa 'sting oparation' kiya
 The truth of the bribe was exposed to the intelligence camera as soon as it entered the Delhi Jal Board
 hamaare khufia camere ne dilli ke bijligharon main bilon kii maafee kii boliyaan nilaam hote hue record kin
 Heat the palm and reduce the bill
 
 
 desh kii rajdhani main sarkari tijori ko chuunaa kaise lagaaya ja rahaa he, isaki misaal hamen bikri kar daftar main mili
 Tax money is going into the pockets of the treasury officers here
 dilli main sahakaari socytiyon kaa bhi bada khel he
 Even in this office under the Delhi government, you cannot get any paper without money
 ghoosekhor afasaron or karmchaariyon kaa haal yah he ki unhone daftar kii mej par yaa sarkari cash counter par hi rishwat ke note khuleam ginaney shuru kar die hai
 Obviously, the government should come or someone, but in the sting operation, it became clear that the season of cutting the pockets of Delhiites has come again
 jalboard main note-note se bharti he afasaron kii jebboond-boond se jalboard kii tank bharti he or note-note se afasaron kii jeb, yahi nazaaraa hamaari team ko us vakt dikhaa, jab tanker book karaane ke bahaane ham jal board ke turkman get daftar pahunche
 From this office, water tankers are supplied for public
 vaise to ek tanker ke liye 700 rupee kii sarkari parchi katati he, lekin yahaan bina parchi kataae hajaar ke hajaar rupee dakaar liye jate hai
 We bumped directly into Puran Chand, the booking clerk of the Jal Board
 
 
 ajtak-kitna paisa de duun aapako
 
 
 
 puuran chand-aap jitna marzi samaj lijie
 
 
 Just understand this, if you take it in private, then you do not get less than Rs 2500 and their water is boring too
 kai baar baaluu-ret bhi aata he
 Aaj Tak - Your water will be fine? Puran Chand - Are there water of No
 1
 
 
 
 Booking clerk of Jal Board Puran Chand said that the water of his Jal Board is number one, it is also true that the rate of his bribe is not less than number 1
 ajtak-kitna de duun
 
 
 Puran Chand - You think as well
 
 
 bhandare kaa kaam he
 If i got married, i would have spoken, but have paid so much favor to us
 itani meharbaani kar lenaa
 
 
 
 
 Aaj Tak-one

 Aaj Tak- These are 2 thousand rupees, okay, as much as you would say, i will give you

 Your work will be done

 Time is over on Monday bijli vibhaag main bhi jamkar rishwatakhorijal board main rishwat jamkar chal rahi he, to bijli ghar main bhi ghoosekhori kaa khulaa khel jari he
 It is possible to get the electricity bill forgiven or to reduce it
 lekin bijli vibhaag ke adhikari rishwat dene ke liye kaise janata ko majaboor karte hai, ajtak ne iskaa bhi bhandaphod kiya
 An officer of a power house in Sagarpur area of delhi caught a case of not installing meters on the first floor of the house
 adhikari ne baad main is maamle ko rafa-dfa karne ke liye deal kii
 The Transport Department is also not behind, it is now the turn of the operation red-handed with the Sales Tax Department, Cooperative Society, Transport Department and DM of North East in Delhi
 ajtak ne sting oparation kiya, to tex panelti se lekar, kooparative sosayadi ke paper nikaalane tak, transport vibhaag se lekar dm daftar tak paise kaa khulaa khel jari he
 In the country's capital Delhi, there are many trucks in the line of these trucks loaded with goods, which have loaded the goods, but have not made a firm receipt
 yani maal par bina tex die, ye trek dilli ke andar daakhil ho rahe the
 You would be surprised to know that these trucks do not pay full tax even after being caught and are exempted
 trek vaale waite ke un afasaron kii mutthi garam karte hai, or aage chalate banate hai
 Aaj Tak's reporter used a similar truck to expose this game of bribe
 andercover reporter waite daftar kaa sach jaanane ki liye khufia camere ke saath afasaron se rou-ba-rou hua
 Even if you are willing to give bribe to the co-operative society under Delhi government, the officials are always ready to help
 dilli ke posh dwarka ilaake kii houseing sosayadi kaa byoraa jaanane ke liye andercover reporter ko sarkaar kii mutthi garam kerani padi

 5
 Mickey Mouse is the first Cartoon character in the history of the world to start speaking
 miki dwaara bolaa gaya pehla shabd 'hot dog' tha
 6
 digni dwaara banaai gai filmon main pehla gaanaa 'you hu' tha
 It was filmed on Mini
 7
 The different thing about making a Mickey cartoon character is that Vault Disney himself was afraid of mice
 iske baavjood unhone is kirdaar ko aisa banaaya
 8
 miki mouse ke dikhne vaale kaan bhale hi tede dikhaai dete hon magar ve hameshaa golakaar hote hai

 lambey samay se dharna rahi he ki sahi or galat shabdon ke bich antar pahchaanane kii maanviya yogyata boli gayi bhashaa se viksit hoti he kyonki bachche pehle se hi maukhik bhashaa ko samajhane kii yogyata ke aadhaar par akshar vinyas samajhate hai
 But now French researchers have challenged the above assumption by studying monkeys (baboons)
 unhone sabit karne kaa prayaas kiya he ki bandar shabdon ke aksharon ke vishesh sanyojanon ko dekhakar unhen pahchaan sakate hai or visangatiyon ko bhi samaj sakate hai, jinhen ab tak bolkar hi samajhane kii baat kahi jaati rahi he
 According to the study, reading comprehension is not just by speaking but also by identifying the letters that make up the word and remembering their regular patterns
 yah baat sienares-eex-marsilli uniwarsity ke laboretair di cychlogy cognitive ke anusandhankartaaon ne kahi he
 The monkeys were shown four-letter English words on the touch screen in the experiment and were trained to press the spheroid on the touch screen when the correct word was spoken, and press the button on the shape of the cross if it was not correct
 kuch hi dinon main dekha gaya ki athak prayaason ke baad bandaron ne angreji ke shabdon main pahchaan kerani shuru kar di or udhaaharan ke taur par vah ‘bank’ shabd kii tarah ek nirthak shabd ‘jank’ main bhed karne lage
 Interestingly, the monkeys, after memorizing the pronunciation of many words, also identified the true and false in the words which were never shown to them
 anusandhankartaaon ke anusaar bandar bhi lagaataar bole jane vaale angreji shabdon ke akshar vinyas ko samajhate hai or yaad kar lete hai

 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne hunamaan road sthit party karyaalay ke baahar kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue apane istife kaa elaan kiya
 He said, 'our biggest issue was to pass the Jan Lokpal bill

 In his brief speech in the Assembly after voting against the introduction of Jan Lokpal Bill, the Chief Minister had said, 'this seems to be our last session
 agar mujhe bhrashtachar ko samaapt karne ke liye mukhyamantri ke pad ko 1,000 baar bhi qurbaan karnaa pade or jaan bhi deni pade, to main khud ko bhaagyashaalee maanoonga

 After pressure from the opposition party BJP and the Congress supporting the government from outside in the House, the speaker read the letter of the Lieutenant Governor to the House, which advised not to introduce this bill
 iske baad vipaksh uparajyapal kii chitthee ko lekar voting kii maang karata rahaa, jabaki dilli sarkaar is mudde par charchaa karaane ko lekar baar-baar aagrah karti najar ai
 However, later the speaker asked the Chief Minister to present the bill and allowed it to be discussed
 is par vipaksh ne kadaa aitraaj jataayaa or spikar par pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 a Congress MLA has also spoken of bringing a no-confidence motion against the speaker
