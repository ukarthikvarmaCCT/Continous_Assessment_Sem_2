 is par himesh ne kaha- 'haa 16 nahin us vakt main shaayad 13-14 saal kaa tha
 Then my father signed him

 The name of the film was Yuva

 'how was the tune of Darna Kya to Pyaar Kiya Kiya?' Himesh said- 'salman came and told me that if he loved, Darna Kya wants to use some tunes
 to iske liye chalange ye tha ki naushaad sahab kaa pyaar kiya to darana kya bahut bada hit tha
 It was very difficult to create a title song on that tune
 logon ke mind se purana nikaal kar nayaa daalana bahut mushkil tha
 So at that time we had a tune Odhni Chunariya, so it became a phrase
 ye sab mere papa kii vajah se sambhav ho sakaa
 They taught me everything
 isi se mujhe ye sab mila

 pradhanmantri narendra modi is saptaah jab charmarate bainkon ke kandhe par sona ke badale byaaj dene kii skim lad rahe the or skim kii safalataa ko lekar banking udyog main buniyadi shaq-shubahon kii charchaa chal rahi thi, tab henry ford yaad aa gaye jinhone kaha tha ki aam log agar yah jaan jaaen ki bank kaise kaam karte hai to baghawat ho jaaegi
 Actually, this saying was recently mentioned by a foreign investor in the context of Indian banking
 ham modi sarkaar main aarthik sudhaaron par charchaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, the investor said that if investors do not ignore the current condition of Indian banks, there will be a revolt in the stock market
 global banking ke taaje khaufnak tajurbon kii roshni main vah niveshak na keval bhartiya baikon ke bure haal ko lekar pareshaan tha balki is baat par jhunjhala rahaa tha ki koi sarkaar itani bephikr kaise ho sakati he ki jab uske bank baari bakaayaa karjon or kism-kism ke ghotaalon ke jakhire par baithe hon tab bainkon main sudhaar kii bajaae vah unke loklubhaavan istemaal ke nae tareeke talash rahi he
 During the election, when the BJP was promising to implement the third generation of economic reforms, it was predicted that bank reforms would be the first priority of the government as it has been pending for a long time
 is bich pichley paanch varshon kii mandi ke kaaran bainkon ke karj kii ugaahi bade paimaane par adhar main latak gai he
 The government-controlled system of banks has been filled with deep opacity, which resulted in various scams
 bhartiya banking sirf sankat main hi nahin he balki global paimaanon par aadhunik hone ke liye bainkon kaa punargathan, sudhaar, nijeekaran or inamen sarkari dakhal kii samaapti anivaary ho gai he taaki inhen utpaadak nivesh ke vitt poshan ke laayak banaaya ja sake
 In light of these expectations, the policies of the Modi government on banks disappoint
 pichley solah maah main modi sarkaar ne pareshanhal bainkon kaa kuch is tarah istemaal shuru kar diya he, jise dekhakar assi ke dashak ke halaat yaad aa jate hai
 Without understanding the condition, capacity and expectations of the banks, the government put its populist mission on the banks
 misaal ke taur par jandhan ko hi len
 Banks needed to be enabled for the natural and profitable expansion of banking, but schemes like Jan Dhan came at a time when banks do not have debt customers and deposit growth was at its 51-year low
 jandhan ne bainkon kii laagat main ijapha kar diya or aise khaaton kaa ambara laga diya jinamein koi sanchaalan nahin hota
 Bank savings are declining due to inflation and recession and the government also has nothing to pay through these accounts at the moment, so Jan Dhan is a burden for banks
 thik yahi haal jan suraksha beemaa baantne kaa hua, jahaan bainkon ne badhati laagat or vittiya dikkaton ke kaaran bahut bad-chadhakar bhaag nahin liya
 Seeing the gold monetization scheme, banks have raised their hands
 sone ke kaarobaar se jude jokhim or munaafon par dabaav ke kaaran sona rakhane par bank acha byaaj nahin de sakate
 According to the Reserve Bank notification, the deposit of gold will fetch an interest of only two to two and a half per cent, which is sufficient to make this scheme unattractive
 mudra bank ke madhyam se lagaae gaye lone meley, shaayad bainkon ke istemaal kii paraakaashtha hai
 The government has tried to run a campaign to disburse small loans without collateral through this, but the banks are not in a condition that they can distribute such revisions
 ye scimen sattar-assi ke dashak kii yaad dilaati hai jab sarkarein bainkon kaa istemaal loklubhaavan raajnneeti main karti thim or use saamaajik banking kaha jaataa tha
 In fact, the latest reality of Indian banks is the crony banking of companies-banks, which is completely contrary to the expectations of social banking
 bainkon ke fanse hue karjon (enpie) kaa sabase badsoorat cheharaa yah he ki bainkon kaa adhikansh bakaayaa karj aam logon, chote udhyamiyon, upabhoktaaon ke paas nahin balki chuninda udyogon ke paas he
 According to the latest Credit Suisse report, 17 per cent of loans given by Indian banks are in trouble
 yah aankada rigerv bank ke shuruaati akalan (11 fisadi) se bada he
 The report says that India's ten large industrial conglomerates have a debt of $ 113 billion
 yah karj bainkon kii sakshmata kaa galaa ghont kar unhen oonchi byaaj dar rakhane par majaboor kiye hue he jabaki desh kaa shesh kshetra—utpaadak, nivesh yaa upbhog ke liye bank karj ke liye taras rahaa he
 There were two big expectations from the government regarding banking
 ek: kroni banking par sakhti hogi or bainkon ke enpie kam kiye jaaenge taaki karj sasta karne kaa rasta ban sake
 Two: The government will reduce its share in banks, privatize it and stop interfering, because cheap loans are the basic requirement for growth
 growth kaa taaja itihaas tej vikaas or saste karj ke bich rishte kaa sabase thos pramaan he
 The growth rate of 7 to 8 per cent in 2005 to 2011 was actually cheap and large amount of bank loan
 baad ke varshon main byaaj daren, karj kaa pravaah gata or growth bhi baith gai
 The government is well aware that it is impossible to return cheap loans without restructuring the banks
 iske baavjood bainkon kaa nayaa or bedadak loklubhaavan istemaal niraash karata he
 Not only this, banks are going to get capital of 700 billion rupees from the taxpayer's money i
e
 budget to change the crony banking and to get the banks out of the trapped debt

 a case of beating up a student from Arunachal Pradesh in Lajpat Nagar area of the capital Delhi has come to light

 There they reached a sweet shop to ask for the address, where a person standing commented on Taniam's hair

 After this, the people present there beat the young man again

 jafarayab jilani ne kaha- court ne mana tha ki ram chabutara janmasthan hejafarayab jilani ne kaha- namaaj ke likhit nahin lekin jubaani saboot hai30 wein din bahes kii shuruyaat muslim paksh kii taraf se rajeev dhawan ne kisupreme court main ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par 30wein (24 sitambar) din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh ne mana ki ram chabutara hi janmasthan he kyonki hindu daavedaar bhi saalon se isi par vishwaas karte rahe hai
 The Muslim side said that in this case the order of the District Judge in 1885 was that Hindus considered Ram Chabootare as a Jansthan
 muslim pakshakaron ne kaha ki jab court kaa aadesh he to ham isse alag kaise ho sakate he? ayodhya ram janmabhumi maamle main 30 wein din bahes kii shuruyaat muslim paksh kii taraf se rajeev dhawan ne kii
 Rajiv Dhawan also referred to several old petitions related to the Ayodhya dispute
 inke jariye unhone yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki masjid par 1949 tak lagaataar muslim paksh kaa kabja rahaa tha
 Rajiv Dhawan said, "mutavalli had filed an application on which the government had ordered
 agar masjid par musalamaanon kaa kabja nahin hota to vah mutavalli arji kyon lagaataa? or adaalat faisla kyon detii? isse sabit hota he ki masjid par muslim kabja tha
 "dhawan also cited the statement of a witness from the Hindu side and said that the idol of Lord Rama was not in the sanctum sanctorum
 garbh grih ke andar kisi bhi bhagwaan kii tasviir nahin thi lekin tab bhi jo log puja karne aate vah railing kii taraf ja kar garbh grih kii taraf jate the
 Rajiv Dhawan said that Gopal Singh Visharad had sued Ramjanmabhoomi claiming personal right of worship and after his death there was no justification for his petition
 rajeev dhawan ne hindu paksh ke ek gavaah kii gavaahi padhate hue kaha ki puja sirf ram chabutare par hoti thi or log ram chabutare ke paas lagi railing kii taraf bhi jate the, murti garbh grih main kaise gai is bare main usko jaankaree nahin he
 In 1949, it was discovered that God has descended in the sanctum sanctorum, but before that there was no idol there
 puranic vishwaas ke anusaar puure ayodhya ko bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan mana jaataa rahaa he lekin iske bare main koi ek khaas jagah nahin bataai gai he
 Rajiv Dhawan, citing the statements of several witnesses, tried to prove that the Muslim had been claiming that place
 sunni vakf board kii taraf se jafarayab jilani ne kii bahesdopaher baad dhawan kii jagah aae jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki janmasthal par ramajanm kaa vishwaas to he par saboot nahin
 He gave his arguments on the basis of Ramcharit Manas and Valmiki Ramayana
 unhone kaha ki ramcharita maanas or ramayana main kahin vishisht taur par ram janmasthan kaa koi zikr nahin
 Secondly, there is no evidence that Rama was born under the middle dome before 1949 because before 1949 there is no existence or proof of worship there
 jilani kii is daleel par justise bobade ne poocha ki aap ye saboot bhi denge ki 1949 se pehle vahaan niyamit namaaj hoti thi? is par jilani bole ki iske likhit nahin jubaani saboot hai
 When Justice Bobde asked Jilani, do you believe that Ram Chabutara is the birthplace? So Zafaryab Jilani said that there is a court order in this case, in which the court believed that Ram Chabutra is the birthplace
 hindu logon kii manyata he
 How can we separate from that
 ayodhya ram jamabhumi maamle main sunwaayee 31wein din yani buudhvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 Zafaryab will hold the Jilani side from the Muslim side
 uske baad puratathvik sakshya par minakshi aroda paksh rakhengi
 Released this Friday, two 'chashme Baddoor', one of which is Saee Paranjpe's original 'chashme Baddoor' made in 1981, digitized form released, and the other is filmmaker David Dhawan's Chashme Baddur ', which is actually a remake
 
 
 ham baat karenge rimek kii
 
 
 The film is the story of three friends - Ali Zafar, Siddharth Narayan and Divyendu Sharma - who together, live in the same room
 
 
 inaki makaan malkin hai lilet dube, jinhen ye teenon vakt par kiraaya nahin de pate
 
 
 Rishi Kapoor is also playing an important role in the story, and runs a cafe named 'nostalgia'
 
 
 is cafe main bhi in teenon doston kaa khaataa chalata he, yani ye teenon rishi kapur ko bhi vakt par paise nahin dete
 
 
 Just like the old 'chashme Baddoor', in this film too, a girl who plays the role of these three friends is played by Taapsee Pannu
 
 
 siddharth or divyendu apane ishk kaa jaal taapasi par phenkate hai, lekin naakaam ho jate hai, or phir taapasi jab apana dil ali zafar ko de baithti he to donon irshyaa se jal marate hai
 
 
 Anupam Kher is playing the role of Taapsee's father and uncle in the film, ie he has a double role in the film
 
 
 khayr, puraani 'chashme baddoor' kamedi film thi, isliye nai 'chashme baddoor' bhi hansaati he
 
 
 One-liners of the film make a lot of laughs
 
 
 siddharth, divyendu or ali zafar, teenon ne acha abhinay kiya he, lekin kahin-kahin siddharth thodaa niraash karte hai
 
 
 The scenes of Rishi Kapoor and Lillet Dubey have become very beautiful, and apart from these two, the acting of Lillet Dubey is also good
 
 
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki rishi apni duusari pari main zyada chauke-chakke laga rahe hai
 
 
 The comments diarector david dhawan ne puraani 'chashme baddoor' kii 'miss chamako' vaala sikvence film main behtareen tareeke se feet kiya he
 
 
 sajid-wajid's music is beautiful
 
 
 gane achche hai or kahin-kahin puraane gaanon kii yaad dilaate hai
 
 
 In this film, only double-meaning dialogues are knocked out
 
 
 david dhawan behtareen editor bhi hai
 
 
 The film runs at such a pace that you might not even get a chance to turn your neck
 
 
 bas, is film main bhi puraani 'chashme baddoor' kii tarah thodi saadagi hoti, to yah behtareen film sabit ho sakati thi, lekin kul milakar nai 'chashme baddoor' jabardast manoranjak film to he hi
 
 
 If you compare it with the old 'chashme Baddoor', you may get some flaws, but the new generation may like this new 'chashme Baddoor' made in today's era
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he 3 star
 
 
 The film is the story of three friends - Ali Zafar, Siddharth Narayan and Divyendu Sharma - who together, live in the same room
 
 
 inaki makaan malkin hai lilet dube, jinhen ye teenon vakt par kiraaya nahin de pate
 
 
 Rishi Kapoor is also playing an important role in the story, and runs a cafe named 'nostalgia'

 Just like the old 'chashme Baddoor', in this film too, a girl who plays the role of these three friends is played by Taapsee Pannu
 
 
 siddharth or divyendu apane ishk kaa jaal taapasi par phenkate hai, lekin naakaam ho jate hai, or phir taapasi jab apana dil ali zafar ko de baithti he to donon irshyaa se jal marate hai
 
 
 Anupam Kher is playing the role of Taapsee's father and uncle in the film, ie he has a double role in the film
 
 
 khayr, puraani 'chashme baddoor' kamedi film thi, isliye nai 'chashme baddoor' bhi hansaati he
 
 
 One-liners of the film make a lot of laughs
 
 
 siddharth, divyendu or ali zafar, teenon ne acha abhinay kiya he, lekin kahin-kahin siddharth thodaa niraash karte hai
 
 
 The scenes of Rishi Kapoor and Lillet Dubey have become very beautiful, and apart from these two, the acting of Lillet Dubey is also good
 
 
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki rishi apni duusari pari main zyada chauke-chakke laga rahe hai
 
 
 The comments diarector david dhawan ne puraani 'chashme baddoor' kii 'miss chamako' vaala sikvence film main behtareen tareeke se feet kiya he
 
 
 sajid-wajid's music is beautiful
 
 
 gane achche hai or kahin-kahin puraane gaanon kii yaad dilaate hai
 
 
 In this film, only double-meaning dialogues are knocked out
 
 
 david dhawan behtareen editor bhi hai
 
 
 The film runs at such a pace that you might not even get a chance to turn your neck
 
 
 bas, is film main bhi puraani 'chashme baddoor' kii tarah thodi saadagi hoti, to yah behtareen film sabit ho sakati thi, lekin kul milakar nai 'chashme baddoor' jabardast manoranjak film to he hi
 
 
 If you compare it with the old 'chashme Baddoor', you may get some flaws, but the new generation may like this new 'chashme Baddoor' made in today's era
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he 3 star

 Director David Dhawan's 'miss Chamko' sequel of the old 'chashme Baddoor' fits well in the film

 David Dhawan is also an excellent editor
 
 
 film aisi raftaar se chalati he ki shaayad aapako gardan ghumaane kaa mauka bhi nahin milegaa
 
 
 If the film had a bit of simplicity like the old 'chashme Baddoor', it could have proved to be a great film, but overall the new 'chashme Baddoor' is a tremendous entertaining film
 
 
 agar isaki tulana puraani 'chashme baddoor' se karen to shaayad aapako thodi khamiyaan milen, par nai peedi aaj ke daur main bani is nai 'chashme baddoor' ko pasand kar sakati he

 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray claimed on Tuesday that if his party had not supported the BJP in 2014, it would have adopted all the tricks including breaking the opposition Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the government in Maharashtra
 apane sahyogi dal par phir prahaar karte hue thakare ne kaha kibijepine desh ke logon ke saath dhokhaa kiya jinhone 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main use vot diya
 He also attacked the BJP for accusing the Congress and the previous UPA government of corruption and said that if corruption has happened, it should be proved rather than 'just throwing mud at others'
 thakare ne kaha, 'yadi hamane sarkaar main bhagidaari nahin kii hoti to bijepi jis tarah har tareekon kaa istemaal kar rajyon ko jitati ja rahi he
 
 
 Just as it broke the Congress and Trinamool Congress in Tripura, it would have broken the Congress and NCP to come to power in Maharashtra
 'unhone shivasena kemukhpatr saamanaamen saakshaatkaar ke duusare hisse main kaha, 'aisa hone dene kii jagah maine apane logon ko sarkaar main kaam karne kaa anubhav lene kii anumati di
 The Shiv Sena is a constituent party in bjp-led governments in the state and at the center
 yah puche jane par ki unhen maharashtra main chaar saal tak satta main rahane se kya mila, thakare ne kaha ki sarkaar main shivasena ke mantriyon ko prashasnic kaary kaa anubhav mila
 He said, 'in a way it is a practice to run the government
 kya kiya janaa chahie, kya nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Also, how the plans should be implemented
 'thakare ne kaha ki maharashtra ke logon ne shivasena ko chhodkar baaki sabhi dalon kii sarkaron kaa anubhav kiya he
 He said, "the power will come (into the hands of Shiv Sena) when people take such a decision
" log ab tak sabhi anya dalon ko dekh chuke hai, lekin unhone keval shivasena ko hi satta main nahin dekha he
 That is why i let my people experience living in power
 'ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki shivasena sansthaapak divangat bal thakare ne apni party banane ke liye kabhi kisi party ko nahin todaa
 He said, 'it was formed as Shiv Sena and is still the same
 usne (shivasena ne) kabhi apana naam, apane netaa or nishaan nahin badale
 No other party was disbanded to form the Shiv Sena
 'bhrashtachar ke mudde kii ore unmukh hote hue shivasena netaa ne jaananaa chaha ki 2ji ghotaale kaa kya hua jisaki charchaa na sirf desh main, balki duniya main hui thi
 He said, 'at that time (when the scam surfaced) the image of the country had reached such a low level that it seemed that there is no other country as corrupt as India
 ' shivasena adhyaksh ne kaha, 'parinaam yah hua ki sarkaar badal gai, lekin bhrashtachar ke aaropon main kuch nahin hua
 Even today, the AAP (BJP) talks about 60 years of corruption, but so far nothing has been proved
 'unhone tanj ksaa, yadi bhrashtachar hua he to ise sabit kiijie
 Raising the lotus in your hands, throwing mud on others and running away is unfair

 However, Rajiv got about 2 to make that shrub land cultivable

 and sowed watermelon and melon crops in this field
 ve kehete hai, ''maine kheti ko aadhunik banane ke liye bas kuch buniyadi baton kaa khyaal rakhaa
 Tried to keep costs down and sowed a crop that does not cost much labor
 " rajeev hansate hue bataate hai ki laagat ko lekar unka sie vaala najariya behad kaam aayaa
 He never sowed a crop whose weight is light
 masalan, matar
 But he must always apply peas before planting watermelon
 isse mitti main nitrogen kii maatra sthir ho jaati he or unki fasal behatar aati he
 While cultivating from a scientific perspective, Rajiv initially broke and removed some fruits when there were more fruits in the melon vines in his fields
 unka kahana he, zyada fal aane se puri fasal kii gunvattta par asar padataa
 Rajiv's net profit from the first crop was Rs 7 lakh

 Inspired by his success, Rajiv has leased 13 acres of land in Anandi village in Ormanjhi block of Ranchi
 ve kehete hai, ''meri kheti se khet maalikon ko phayda hota he kyonki ek to main unhen prati acre 5 se lekar 10,000 ru
 i pay rent annually and also to give them the wages of working on their own farm
 isse unki aamadani pehle se adhik he

 adhik nafe ke liye unhone apni sari fasal hoseller ko dene kii bajaae uskaa takreeban aadha hissaa apane logon ke jariye khudara bechnaa shuru kiya
 This also increased net profits
 ve neem kii pattiyon or karanja kii pattiyon kaa istemaal kitnashak ke taur par karte hai
 Rajiv further adds, "I do not sow melon seeds directly in the fields
 balki iske bichade taiyaar karata hum
 By keeping a gap of a fortnight in the planting of these bitches, there is also a difference of two weeks in the arrival of my crop
 isse marketing main phayda hota he
 "with his business intelligence, Rajiv has transformed farming into a lucrative business

 vah daur us tarah ke prem kaa tha lekin yah daur is tarah ke prem kaa nahin he jo 'aashiqui-2' main najar aata he
 Today, when everyone wants to see the hero larger than life, the hero of 'aashiqui 2' reminds us of Devdas
 film kaa first half acha he, lekin doosraa thodaa sust or kanfujing he
 There is a lack of newness in the story, the impression of Bhatt Camp on the songs is very clear

 rahul sharaab auki hataasha ke sagar main gum ho jaataa he, or phir kahani main kai prasang daudane lagate hai
 The film's writer Shagufta Rafiq has not been successful in giving a new touch to this love story
 film kii kahani hamen kuch-kuch abhimaan kii yaad dilaati he
 Sometimes there seems to be a lack of freshness and an overdose of over-emotionality
 star apiladitya roy kapur isse pehle landan drims, guzarish or ection riple main najar aae the, lekin kamyaabi unke haath nahin lagi thi
 For the first time in Aashiqui-2, he is in the lead role and has given excellent moments in the film
 screen par unki maujuudagi vaaki acchhee lagati he
 It will not be wrong if they are called the new heart throb
 shraddha kapur bhi arohi ke role main jami hai
 The innocence of his face is well known
 khubasurat to vah hai hi
 But they still have to clean their hands about acting
 kamai kii batfilm ko dekhne waalon main zyada taadaad yuvaaon kii rahane vaali he
 Much of this film is in the hands of the new generation
 lekin kamjor kahani ke kaaran film se bahut bade chamatkaar kii ummid to nahin he
 It is a tried and tested formula
 film lo bajet he, khatre kii sambhaavnaaen kam hi hai
 If you have been wanting to watch a romantic film for a long time, Aashiqui-2 can be seen on weekends

 modi sarkaar ke antim daur main ye aankade achche nahin kahe ja sakate
 This has also increased the possibility that the Reserve Bank will further cut interest rates
 janvari main mahangaai kii dar badhkar 2
 Has reached 57 percent
 iske pichley maheene main mahangaai dar 2
 Was 05 percent
 haalanki yah ab bhi rigerv bank ke comfortbal range 4 fisadi ke bheetar hi he

 jidipi ko jahaan samoochee arthvyavastha kii gati kaa anumaan lagata he, vahiin aiipi se yah pataa chalata he ki audyogic gatividhi kis tarah kii he
 The reduction in IIP means that orders for industries are coming down for the next months, ie overall consumption by the public is also decreasing
 tractor jaise auto utpaadon kii gramin kshetron main maang ghatane ko bhi isaki vajah mana jaataa he
 And the interest rates may come down
 The inflation rate is still within the comfort level of 4% of the Reserve Bank
 duusari taraf, aiipi main giravat ai he
 In such a situation, there is another possibility of the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates to increase the demand

 4 fisadi kii badhat hui thi
 According to declining government expenditure, the growth in fixed deposits such as investment and personal consumption has been steadily increasing, but government spending has come down
 rigerv bank ke paper ke anusaar iconomi main sarvice sector kaa yogadan lagaataar bad rahaa he or krishi kshetra kaa yogadan ghat rahaa he
 In this fiscal year 2018-19, the contribution of service sector to GDP will be around 62 per cent, while agriculture sector contributes 14

 The judgment is perhaps the first instance in which the Supreme Court not only granted a Special Leave Petition (SLP) against the award of an arbitrator made under the Interstate River Water Disputes Act of 1956, but also altered the award of that award
 
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 262 ke tahat banaaya gaya yah kanoon sheersh nyaayalay sahit tamaam adaalaton ko panchat ke kisi bhi faisle ke khilaaf kii gai kisi bhi kism kii apil par vichaar karne se roktaa he
 The National Water Policy (NWP) does not have the power of law in India
 yah bahut hi durlabh he ki ek nyaayik aadesh main jal niti kaa zikr kiya gaya he or is tarah jal niti ko kanoon kii takat de di gai he
 This means that the water policy can be called for in future petitions
 par faisle main jal niti 1987 or 2002 kaa zikr kiya gaya he, magar jal niti 2012 kaa nahin, jabaki yahi niti philhal lagu he
 Not only this, the water allocation priorities enumerated in the Water Policy 2012 are somewhat different from the Supreme Court's decision
 phir bhi kaveri basin ke baahar ke ilaakon ko (seedbludity ke faisle ke mutabik bangaluru kaa do-tihaai hissaa kaveri basin se baahar he) shaamil karne kii garaj se jal niti kii duhai dena puri tarah nyyochit nahin he, vah bhi mahaj isliye ki shahar kii peyajal kii jarurat ko sabase oonchi praathamikta di ja sake
 Bringing underground water into the ambit of this equation is a welcome step, unfortunately the tribunals did not consider it
 yahaan tak ki supreme court kaa faisla bhi is maamle main zyada dur nahin jaataa
 In this sense, the presence of an additional 10 TMC feet of water in Tamil Nadu makes an immediate and possibly inaccurate estimate
 supreme court kaa faisla is baat ko bhi saaf kar detaa he ki maujuuda aavanton agle 15 saalon tak lagu rahegaa
 So, has this decision resolved the very complicated Cauvery dispute? We will only know when the year of water shortage comes

 The answers were ruthless, comparing them to "a complete storm"

 He asserted that these laws hurt deeply frozen interests and he followed Narendra Modi
 isse zyada ahm baat yah thi ki congress ke puraane netaaon or rahul gandhi kii aguai main taiyaar ho rahe nae netaaon ke bich algaav badhata gaya
 During this whole wobbly postmortem, Rahul used to tell his close aides that such a bad defeat was the "best thing" and "the greatest learning experience" for him
 april 2015 main chuttee se lautne par congress ke upaadhyaksh ne apane liye saaf or do-took agenda tay kiya-us dharna ko dhwast karnaa, jise modi ne apane abhootpurv chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan itani jaddojahad ke saath viksit kiya tha
 By borrowing the words of Paulo Coello, who has been referring to the talks of Rahul recently, the entire political atmosphere of the country has also become involved in the conspiracy to support his mission
 agar janvari 2015 main modi ke nafis suut ne, jis par unka naam kadha hua tha, surkhiyaan batorin, to agle hi maheene dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav main bijepi kii haar ne unke aparaajey hone ke myth kii hawa nikaal di
 In his new avatar, which appeared for the first time in the monsoon session of Parliament, Rahul coined the first political idiom of his career as “suit-boot ki Sarkar
 ”yah siyaasi shabdaawalee bhi kisi ittfa kaa nateeja nahin thi
 In his words himself, it was "a rubbing of the Congress rig over him"
 vah ateet ke academik salaahkaaron se mili or unase baat kii, magar siyaasi laffaaji ke saath apane sandesh kii packaging karne kii ahmiyat ve samaj chuke the

 The next step was to master the fun of how each issue is transformed into a fight between the poor versus the rich — whether it is a land acquisition or GST, Modi's foreign tours or Maharashtra, Bundelkhand or Andhra Pradesh May the farmers be in trouble
 dekhte hi dekhte praathmik vimarsh vikaas, naukariyon, bhrashtachar or garibi se hatakar gomance par pratibandh, award vaapasi, apatiai main niyukti, jati ko lekar jang or asahmati ke adhikaar par aa gaya
 The slogan of Jung was also found ready-decorated on a saucer-sharing BJP vs inclusive Congress

 This new incarnation of Rahul has led to an increase in the public support of the Congress in the latest public opinion poll and he has emerged as Modi's main rival
 to bhi jang abhi mahaj chathai hi jiti gai he
 Many Congress leaders acknowledge that Rahul is yet to gain acceptance of the corporate world of the country, who sees him as anti-industry due to his stern stance on land acquisition and environmental issues

 ham bante hue, khandit vyaktitv ke daur main rah rahe hai
 Public life is awash with countless stories of the misconduct of powerful men
 lekin india today group-emdiare, 2013 sex surveykshan main purushon ke aacharan main sex ke prati sanyamee yaa sankochi bhav ek ahm pahalu ke taur par saamne aayaa he
 It may not be as surprising as it sounds
 sambhawatah yahi is daur kii swaabhaavik bhaavana he
 In today's era, public aggression and personal humility have become the criteria of his masculinity and work spirit
 ‘‘sanyamee yaa sankochi’’ vah he, jo ‘‘uchit’’ aacharan banaae rakhane kii koshish karata he, ‘‘shaleenta’’ ke str ko kaayam rakhane kii maang karata he or dusron ke ‘‘ashaaleen’’ aacharan ko naapsand bhi karata he
 Today, this sobriety and inhibition is generally very irrationally linked to the stereotypical views of sex
 ve is vishay kii khuli charchaa tak se parhez karte hai
 Another important aspect of it is that it is related to women
 jaise hi ham sanyamee yaa sharmili kehete hai, dimag main kisi madhyavay (or shaayad ankhon par chashma chadaaye hue) mahila kaa chitra ubharta he, jo hameshaa jaraa se bhi ‘‘atireki’’ haavbhaav yaa baatcheet ke upar fouran sawalia ungali uthaane ko tatpar rahati he
 This is a kind of historical prejudice and a certain kind of thinking confined in the same realm of men
 jab yon ichchhaaon ke izhaar or sweekaar kii baat aati thi to striyon ko aisa karne kii ijaajat nahin thi
 They were expected to suppress their feelings within themselves
 bahut sari striyon ne aisa kiya bhi
 It is a matter of time that men can also be self-conscious or shy
 beshak, yah baat itani sidhi or aasaan nahin he
 This spartan man is a product of our times
 mardaangi kaa ek ahm pahalu rahaa he uskaa dikhaava or uske bare main bad-chadhakar baat karnaa
 The display of his sexual powers is also a display of masculinity
 or vah umr vagairah kii shaareerik baadhaon ko bhi paar karata rahaa he, varanaa use apane paurush main kami kaa ehsaas hota he
 Yet in the latest sex survey we find that most men are reluctant to talk about pre-marital, extramarital and money-bought sex relationships
 (survey main 73 pratishat purushon ne kaha ki unhone paise dekar kabhi sex nahin kiya
 ) If we assume that the men are probably more active in this type of sex, but they did not think it right to tell about this to the surveyors, then also the question arises why they are not speaking? 70 percent of men said that they do not brag about their sex relations
 apane kisi kriyalap ke bare main khulkar bolnaa khud ko duniya ke saamne pesh karne kaa ek tarika bhi hota he
 So till now, the men who have been known to boast about their sex abilities, why have they become so self-conscious? The leader of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, is not a restrained man at all
 agar sanyamee-sankochi hona koi gun he to survey se pataa chalata he ki purush ghar main ek patni vrath kaa paalan karne main paryaapt nipun hai
 In our imagination, a wife or a husband fasting is an important place and this is the foundation of the popular society
 lekin hamaara saarvajanik yaa vyaktigat gyaan hamen bataata he ki ek pati yaa patni vrath kii raah nek iraadon or tode gaye vaadon kii kahaniyon se bhari padi he
 But still we stick to this ideal, which is called civilized behavior
 is survey main bahut choti sankhya main (5
 4 percent) men admitted that they changed their sexual partners
 agar partner badalanaa adhikansh mardon ke liye kuch zyada hi krantikari baat he-kyonki iskaa arth he ki patniyon yaa garlfrendon ke bhi kai partner ho sakate hai-to vivahetar sambandhon ke bare main kya kaha jaae?hamaare upanyaason or filmon main aise kisse bhare pade hai ki shahari mardon kii bagal main kisi kaa saath-saath chalanaa mardaangi kii baat maani jaati he
 Extramarital relationships of men also do not affect domestic succession
 purush khulkar maidan maarthe hai, lekin striyaan acchhee patni bani rahati hai (film sahab, bibi or gulam ko yaad kiijie)
 But interesting figures have also been found in this case
 2013 main sirf 21 pratishat purushon ne vivahetar sambandhon kii baat sweekaar kii, jabaki ek dashak pehle tak yah aankada kareeb 27 pratishat tha
 So is this phase of the rise of neo-traditionalism in men, in which it is returning to old family values and restraining its lust? The family is finding an important place in the current survey
 bhartiya log, jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai, parivaar ke bare main behad samvedansheel hai
 We condemn the West for high rates of divorce and are proud of their permanent family life, but according to the survey, 40 percent of men consider pre-marital sex to be wrong (a figure that has risen more than a decade ago) and Only 34 percent admit of premarital sex (this number has decreased since a decade ago)
 rishton ke tuutane ke sawaal par purush sanyam or samajhadaari ko mahatv dete lagate hai
 The woman making independent decisions is the cause of man's trouble (remember pride) and if the matter is about a woman's sex relations then the whole world is reversed
 agar purush ke vivahetar sambandh hon to patniyon se vivaah todgaye kii ummid nahin kii jaati
 But if the woman has an extramarital affair, the man will abandon her
 isliye survey se yah bhi ascharyajanak aankada nikalakar aayaa ki jahaan 2004 main partner se shdhokhaay khaane par 26 pratishat purush sambandh todgaye ke himachati the, 2013 main unka pratishat ghatakar 14
 2 is done
 isi tarah yah bhi hairaan karne vaala tathy he ki kareeb 56 pratishat purushon ne apane bevafa partner se kinaaraa karne ke badale usase baat karke hal nikaalane kii baat kii
 a decade ago, the number of people saying such a thing (about 38 percent) was quite low
 ek taraf chaaron ore purushon kii sex aakraamakata kii kahaniyon kii gunj he or duusari ore 2013 ke is survey main sex ko lekar purushon kii sanyamit or santulit soch nikalati he? yah ham kaise daur main pahunch gaye hai? yah kaisaa sikaa he, jiske donon ore do vipareet tasviren hai? isse ham chaahe jo nishkarsh nikaalen, lekin yah ek aisa sikaa he, jisamen saarvajanik aakraamakata or vyaktigat vinayashiltaa ek saath chal sakati hai
 On social and cultural fronts, perhaps we are going through a period of great turmoil
 chunki mahilaayein pehle se adhik kaamkaaj ke liye baahar nikal rahi hai, saarvajanik manchon par unki maujuudagi bad rahi he, saarvajanik kshetra main ve purushon ke aadhipaty ko chunauti detii dikh rahi hai or isi vajah se anachaahe iraadon kaa bhi shikaar ho rahi hai
 On the other hand, men who are always looking for ways to prove their manhood, are now also concerned about maintaining the old established traditional system by adopting the middle path
 kam se kam jaisaa ki 2013 ke sex surveykshan se pataa chalata he, nijee jivan main purushon kaa sanyam kii ore mudtha bhi usee puraani parampara ko bachaae rakhane kii ek kavayad he
 This neo-traditionalism, "a return to legitimate sex relations and family values, is an exercise to regain the past that has been slipping away and may never return

 In a three-page letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Anna said that he would participate in Team Anna's demonstration starting on 25 July and would also join the movement of yoga guru Baba Ramdev starting on 9 August

 'anna ne kaha, 'maine kisi bhi rup main sarkaar kii madad nahin kii he or khurshid ko spasht rup se apni maangon ke bare main bataaya tha
 i suspect that the intention of the government behind Khurshid sent to me was probably to show that i am talking to the government without talking to the rest of the members
 'unhone kaha ki khurshid ne unase mulaakaat kii baat gupt rakhane or pradhanmantri evam congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke saath baatcheet karne ke baad team ke sadasyon se vichaar-vimarsh karne ko kaha tha
 Anna said, 'I kept a secret meeting with Khurshid thinking that an effective Lokpal Bill could be brought
 aisa ho jaae to isse behatar kuch or nahin ho saktaa
 i had asked Khurshid how the government would reintroduce the bill proposed by the social organization when the Lok Sabha has passed a bill
 'unhone kaha, 'khurshid ne mujhase kaha tha ki 25 july ko andolan shuru hone se pehle sarkaar ghoshnaa karnaa chaahati he ki usne saamaajik sanghathan dwaara prastaavit vidheyak ko sweekaar kar liya he
 i think the government wants to split between us and we have decided not to talk to the government any further

 Meanwhile, the Congress Working Committee meeting chaired by Sonia Gandhi also mourned the death of Khandu
 raashtrapati pratibha patil ne apane shok sandesh main kaha ki khandu aise raajnneetik the jinhone apana jivan saarvajanik kaaryon main sakriyata se lagaaya or vah janata kii nabj ko acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Vice President Hamid Ansari said that Khandu was a charismatic leader who believed that the welfare and well-being of a society could not be judged only from the scale of material development, but from the human development of its people
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne khandu kii patni rinchim drema ko bheje apane shok sandesh main kaha ki divangat netaa ne rajya ke liye puure samarpan ke saath kaam kiya or uske hiton ko badhaava dene ke liye athak parishram karte rahe
 The Prime Minister has said that Khandu was a senior politician who worked tirelessly to promote the interests of the state
 april 2007 main arunachal pradesh kaa mukhyamantri niyukt kiye jane ke baad rajya ke vikaas ke liye unhone kadi mehnat kii or puure samarpan ke saath kaam kiya
 "he said," Arunachal Pradesh and the country have lost an experienced and capable leader who had spent years in dedicated public service

 bal kishan kehete hai ki jiladhyaksh or party ke logon ne unako pad kaa laalach diya magar wo chunaav lard kar rahenge
 However, senior party leader Harun Yusuf says that it is the party's best effort to remove angry candidates from the electoral fray so that it does not harm the party

 While the dopt Department of the Central Government has directed that it is the order of 11 January 2016 that a considerable time gap is being observed in the advertisement of vacancy and completion of the process

 Do those wise also feel that the selection commission takes three to three years to complete the examination process for the recruitment of 600 posts

 In the era of mass media, the unemployed have to become their own media while they also pay for cable and newspaper
 india main berojgaar bahut achche market hai
 Keep watching these slogans and understand who is listening to the unemployed
 ve khud hi apana bulatin bana rahe hai, apane fasebuk pej par daal rahe hai or ek duusare ko pard rahe hai
 Not only this, these people also collected donations from Pay TM for the months of May and June
 ganga nagar ke arun kumaar ne bataaya ki 28000 rupee jamaakar binar poster banaaya
 Went to coaching center
 pamfalet baante
 Neither the students felt the difference nor did any media come
 bahut se chaatr aise mili jo 2015 kii pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Looking forward to joining the 2016 examination
 imtahaan hone main saal se zyada vakt lagata he or jwining kaa koi pataa hi nahin
 The entire youth of the students is all in this
 ghar baithe inhen naujavaanon ke liye ham log channelon se vahi vaala topic rose paros rahe hai taaki unhen apni naukari kaa pataa hi na chale

 She is known as Gujarat Model
 ' unhone kaha, 'gujarat main sarkari pad or mantralay majaa karne ke strot nahin hai balki logon kii seva karne kaa jariya hai
 This kind of culture has been developed by the BJP government and the result is visible

 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the daughter of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi and sister of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, has officially entered politics
 unhen congress kaa mahasachiv banaaya gaya he or loksabhaa chunaav ke liye purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari di gai he
 With Priyanka's entry in politics, the one question that is being asked most is whether she will contest the Lok Sabha elections? If she will fight, from which seat will she be in the election field? Priyanka has got the responsibility of Purvanchal, in such a situation, it is being speculated that she can start her election career from this region
 taaki kaaryakartaaon main josh bharaa ja sake or puure kshetra main votaron ko bhi prabhavit kiya ja sake
 Political analysts have also started assessing Priyanka Gandhi's constituency
 lagaataar kai aisi siton ke naam aa rahe hai jahaan se congress mahasachiv apana raajnneetik kariyar shuru kar sakati hai
 1
 raibarelisambhavit siton main sabase pehle raibareli kaa naam aa rahaa he
 Right now, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi is an MP, but her health has been bad for a long time
 badhati umr or kharaab tabiyat kaa hi takaza he ki sonia gandhi apane kshetra main kaaphi kam jaati hai
 Priyanka has also been campaigning for her mother in Rae Bareli earlier
 itnaa hi nahin sthaneey netaaon se lekar kaaryakartaaon ko vah naam se jaanati hai
 2
 amethigandhi parivaar kaa garh maane jane vaali amethi loksabhaa seat se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi saansad hai
 In the 2014 elections, she was given a direct contest from this seat by Union Minister Smriti Irani, this time too she can try her luck from here
 aise main kayaas ye bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki priyanka gandhi yahaan se chunaav lard sakati hai taaki ladaai priyanka banaam smriti ho jayega
 If this happens, Rahul Gandhi can contest from Rae Bareli as well
 3
 Varanasi, considered to be the center of east east, is one of the most VIP seats in the country
 pradhanmantri narendra modi yahaan se saansad hai
 There is also speculation that Congress may field its biggest trumpet Priyanka Gandhi from here
 purv kendriya mantri kapil sibbal kaa ek twit bhi isi baat ke sanket detaa he
 Significantly, if the Congress takes Priyanka from here, a big message will go all over the country
 4
 Phulpur, another important seat of Phulpur East Zone, is also included in those places where Priyanka Gandhi is likely to contest elections
 ye seat congress kii paaramparik seat maani jaati he, desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru yahaan se teen baar saansad chune gaye the
 Apart from this, his sister Vijay Laxmi Pandit also won the election from here twice
 aise main kaaryakartaaon kii maang he ki priyanka gandhi yahaan se hi loksabhaa chunaav laden
 The seat went to the Bharatiya Janata Party's account in the 2014 elections, but the BJP lost in the subsequent by-elections
 5
 Gorakhpur - Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat is a stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been a Member of Parliament from here
 haalanki, abhi hue upachunaavon main bijepi ko yahaan haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 If Priyanka Gandhi contests from here, she will directly contest the BJP in her stronghold in Uttar Pradesh
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi buudhvaar ko bayaan dekar saaf kiya tha ki unhone priyanka ko sirf 2 maheene ke liye nahin bheja he
 His aim is to become the Chief Minister of Congress in Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh kii 11 siton par hue the upachunaavbhajpa or apana dal gathbandhan kaa 8 seat par kabjasapaa ko 3 seat par jeet, basapa kaa nahin khulaa khataaharyana or maharashtra ke vidhansabha ke saath hi uttar pradesh main 11 siton par hue upachunaav ke parinaam ghoshit ho gaye hai
 In 11 seats of Uttar Pradesh, BJP has won 8 and SP has won 3 seats
 vahiin mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (BSP) kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa he
 After this defeat, BSP supremo Mayawati has accused the BJP and Samajwadi Party of conspiracy
 unhone twit kar kaha-upi vidhansabha aamchunaav se pehle bispi ke logon kaa manobal giraane ke shadyantra ke tahat bijepi dwaara is upachunaav main sapa kii kuch siten jitaane va bispi ko ek bhi seat nahin jeetne dene ko party ke log acchhee tarah se samaj rahe hai
 They will definitely gather wholeheartedly to fail their conspiracy
 — Mayawati (@mayawati)october 24, 2019basapa kaa nahin khulaa khataayaha bataa den ki samaajawaadee party ne rampur ke alaava jalalpur or jaidpur par seat jitkar apane vidhayakon kii sankhya main ijapha kiya he to bhaajapa or apana dal gathbandhan ko- lakhanu kaint, govindnagar (kanpur), manikpur, belha, iglas, gangoh, ghosi, pratapgarh par jeet mili he
 At the same time, the account of BSP and Congress has not been able to open an account in these elections
 haryana chunaav main congress ne kiya dushpracharharyana vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par mayawati ne kaha, '' haryana kii janata bhi bijepi sarkaar ke kushasan se kaaphi duhkhi va trast thi or inase mukti chaahati thi
 But the Congress party greatly publicized the fear of dividing votes in public for their selfishness

 As a result, the BSP could not win the seat in the Haryana Assembly general election this time, although the BSP has received more votes than the previous time
 uttar pradesh main gomti kinare based sultanpur kii sultanate par lambey samay tak congress kaa kabja rahaa he, lekin raibareli or amethi kii tarah kabhi ise viviipi seat kii ahmiyat nahin mil saki
 On this seat, from Congress to Janata Dal, BJP and BSP have managed to win the victory
 lekin samaajawaadee party is seat par kabhi bhi jeet kaa swaad nahin chakh saki he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP removed Varun Gandhi, the heir of the 'gandhi family' from the adjacent area of the Congress fort, and made it high profile
 saath hi saath 16 saal ke apane sookhe ko bhi khatm kar camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi
 Political background Since Independence, there have been 16 Lok Sabha elections and 3 by-elections in Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat so far
 1951 se 1971 tak jansangh ne congress se seat chhinane kii koshish to bahut kii lekin kabhi kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 Congress got its first success in 1977
 pehali baar is seat se 1951 main congress ke bivi kesakar jitkar saansad pahunche
 After this, Govind Malaviya in 1957, Kunwar Krishna Verma in 1962, Ganpat Sahai in 1967 and Kedar Nath Singh in 1971 managed to win the elections
 congress ko pehali baar mili harasultanpur seat par 1977 main congress ko pehali haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa, jab janata party ke zulfikurulla congress ko haraakar saansad bane
 However, the Congress returned to this seat once again in 1980 and won again in 1984

 The BJP has won four times between 1991 and 2014
 1991 or 1996 main vishnanath shastri jite, 1998 main devendra bahadur or 2014 main varun gandhi
 At the same time, the BSP has won this seat twice, but the mps have been different both times
 pehali baar 1999 main jai bhadra singh or 2004 main mohammad taahir khan basapa se saansad chune gaye
 The voting pattern of Sultanpur seat is a specialty of Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat
 bijepi ke vishwanath shastri ko chhod de to doosraa koi aisa cheharaa nahin he jo is seat par duusari baar saansad banane main kaamyaab rahaa ho
 This is the reason that no single leader has ever dominated this seat
 aazaadee ke baad congress yahaan 8 baar jiti, lekin har baar chehre alag rahe
 In the same way, the BSP won twice and were different both times
 jabaki bijepi chaar baar jiti jisamen teen chaar chehre shaamil rahe

 Financial needs change with change in one's life stage
 Whether it's your marriage, children's education or retirement years, you need money to get through the various stages of life comfortably
 Life insurance helps you meet these requirements and prepares you for unforeseen expenses
 Insurance provides you with financial security that helps you take care of your loved one
 In order to reap the benefits that insurance has to offer, you must factor in insurance early in life
 When it comes to insurance, be an early bird Ideally, it makes sense to buy at least one life insurance policy when you have just started to earn
 Doing so has its own advantages
 Not only do you add a critical instrument to your financial portfolio, but it also helps ensure that your family's financial situation does not debilitate should anything untoward happen to you
 Besides, when you start young, the premium amounts too are lower
 At a later stage in life, you can always revisit your insurance portfolio and add another policy keeping with your changing financial needs
 This process is called a life insurance review and is extremely important
 Review your insurance plan from time to time Life insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution
 It is therefore important to review your insurance plan at regular intervals
 It will prepare you for life's various milestones and the associated expenses
 One of the biggest advantages of a life insurance review is that you do not stay underinsured
 As age advances, your responsibilities increase and lifestyle undergoes changes
 Based on timely reviews, you can revise your life insurance cover from time to time
 It is only with constant reviewing of your insurance plan can you start building a corpus for your old age
 Planning for the futureyou start working, get married, have kids and soon enough, your kids grow up
 Even before you realize it, you find yourself standing with a farewell bouquet at the threshold of a new phase of life - the post-retirement period
 To ensure that you don't take a financial hit in your older age, you must plan for it in advance
 Taking a life insurance policy at a young age will simplify things for you as you approach the golden years of your life
 There are varied options of retirement plans that one can choose from
 You can choose to go with monthly income or annual payouts as per your requirements
 If you choose to buy a monthly income plan, you will be entitled to a monthly income during your post-retirement years
 How your retirement plan will help you in your old age On various occasions, people are under the impression that savings accrued over a lifetime are sufficient to see them through old age
 This is perhaps one of the biggest misconceptions
 Life is unpredictable and sometimes all it takes is a bout of critical illness to wipe out all that you had saved
 You can avoid such a situation by opting for a retirement plan early in life (preferable in late 20s or early 30s)
 It supplies you with an income every month, almost similar to the salary that you used to receive when you were employed
 You can use this money for your routine expenses as also for health emergencies

 For those looking to buy insurance directly from the internet, there is theonline term insurance plan called eprotect
 Their policies come ataffordable premiumamounts and offertax benefits
 That's not all
 Buying a policy is just the beginning of a fruitful association that culminates at the time of claims settlement
 For this, the company has adedicated claims handlerwho will assist you with the whole process
 While none of us can gaze into a crystal ball and find out what the future holds, we can at least make the right choices which can help secure the future

 He said that if justice is received from the Supreme Court, he will end his protest demonstration
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha, jahaan par bijepi alpamat main hogi vahaan bhi vah kahegi ki use bahumat mil gaya he
 There is a question that BJP has got 104 seats in Karnataka whereas there should be 112 to form the government

 He said that BJP has 104 mlas and needed 112 for majority while there are 2 Independents
 isse sarkaar nahin ban sakati he
 Yashwant Sinha said, Goa, Manipur, the principle that formed the government should be adopted in Karnataka
 isi tarah congress ke media prabharee randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki is desh main ek samvidhan or ek kanoon hi hoga
 If the people of BJP are arguing for the largest party, then the governments of Bihar, Goa and Manipur should resign first
