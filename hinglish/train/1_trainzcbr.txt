 ) indore ke vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey dwaara sarkari adhikari ke saath durvyavhaar ke baavjood bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ne koi sabak nahin liya he
 The latest case is from Bina in Sagar district, from where the video of the incident of a Bharatiya Janata Party MLA with a government official is going viral
 darasal binaa se bijepi vidhayak mahesh raay party kaaryakartaaon ke saath bijli ke bade hue bilon kii samasya ko lekar esadm karyaalay gyaapan dene pahunche the
 But SDM Karori Lal Meena did not come out of his chamber to take the memorandum and asked him to give the memorandum to the tehsildar
 bas isi baat se vidhayak kaa paara saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya or unhone esadm ko unke hi karyaalay main jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 The mla's resentment did not end here but he started raising slogans of SDM Murdabad in the SDM office itself
 is dauraan naaraaz bijepi vidhayak ne esadm se kaha ki 'abhi tumhari nayi posting hui he, tum nae ho or aapako tarika nahin pataa he ki ek emele se kaise baat kii jaati he
 BJP MLA Mahesh Rai said about the entire incident, 'people of the assembly constituency came to me about the electricity bill and were also talking about loan waiver
 usee ko lekar bhartiya janata party ke sabhi kaaryakartaaon ne aam janata ke saath tay kiya tha ki somvaar ko ham 11 baje esadm ko gyaapan denge or vahi gyaapan esadm ko dene ham log karyaalay pahunche the
 But during that time, the sdms had indecent behavior with BJP workers
 'unhone aage kaha ki vah khud baithkar baat karte rahe jabaki ek vidhayak hone ke naate main unke saamne khadaa hua tha
 Such officials are deliberately trying to harass and insult the Bharatiya Janata Party workers
 bijepi ne vidhayak kaa kiya samarthanhairaani kii baat yah he ki bhartiya janata party ne akaash vijayawargeey dwaara sarkari adhikari ke saath kii gai marpet ke baad bhi koi sabak nahin liya he
 This is the reason why the BJP has supported the behavior of the MLA without a government official
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne kaha he ki, 'binaa SDM vidhayak evam kshetra kii janata kaa naa keval apmaan kar rahe hai balki apni jimmedaari se munh modakar galat udhaaharan de rahe hai
 The officer who refuses to take the memorandum and meet the electricity bill victims will be called the "true officer" of the Congress government
 bijepi pravaktaa ne aage kaha, 'log pareshaan hai janpratinidhi unki baat kehane or gyaapan dene aae hai bas milakar baat karne or gyaapan lene kaa hi to aagrah kar rahe the lekin majaal he laat sahab ke aaraam main koi khalal daal de

 countes eva acoblad ek swedish mahaan krishi vigyaani thim, jinhone aalu se starch nikaalane kaa tarika dhundha tha
 Not only this, the starch free baking that you use today is also their contribution
 iske alaava unhone vodaka, moonshine or potato wine jaise alcohol banaaya
 Eckblad was born on 10 July 1724
 aaj unka 293waan janmdin he, jise google bhi apane andaaj main celibratt kar rahaa he
 Google has created a caricature, in which Google's spelling is completed with potatoes and peels

 She was the first woman to get a place in the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
 sweden main pehali baar saal 1658 main aalu aane shuru hue
 At that time, people considered it not fit for humans to eat and used to feed animals
 jaaniye, aakhir koun tha tarajan, jiske naam par bani kai filmein
 
 
 akblood cultivated potatoes and started experimenting on it
 acoblad ne ye suna tha ki germany main aalu se alcohol banaai jaati he
 In the year 1746, Ekblad discovered that flour could be made from this vegetable which was fed to animals
 24 saal kii acoblad ne apni khoj ko royal swedish academy of sciensej main jamaa kiya or iske baad unhen is pratishthit santhaan main bhartee kar liya gaya

 haal hi main viraat ne ek intervyuu main anoushka sharma ke saath apni mulaakaat ke bare main bhi baat kii thi

 Virat was not even aware that Anushka Sharma is working with him in this ed

 neshnal register of citigens (NRC) ke masale tiemasi supremeo mamata banerjee ne ‘civil war’ kii ashanka jataa di to congress sakate main aa gai
 The Congress feels that BJP President Amit Shah first press conference with his statement in Rajya Sabha and tried to polarize hindu-muslim nationwide by taking the issue forward
 party maanati he ki mamata ke aakraamak tewaron ne hi amit shah ko ye mauka de diya
 Top Congress sources believe that Mamta has no problem with this stance in Bengal, but BJP including Bengal will take every tactic to gain political mileage across the country
 darasal, congress ne ranneeti banaai thi ki is mudde par aakraamak nahin hona he, balki isko lagu karne main aa rahi khaamiyon ko lekar sawaal uthaae jaaen
 At the same time, she kept saying that the agreement was signed by Rajiv Gandhi
 manmohan singh sarkaar ke vakt supreme court kii nigaraanee main ye shuru hua, isliye congress iske khilaaf nahin
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also wrote his stand on the Facebook page on some similar lines
 centre kii siyasat ke maddenjar mamata ke bayaan kaa bengal or assam congress se karaayaa gaya virodh-mamtake NRC par rukh ne congress ko majaboor kar diya qi, wo apana paksh mamata se alag rakhe
 Doing this at the central level would have affected the relationship between the two parties, so late on Tuesday evening, Congress strategists asked party units in Assam and Bengal to take a separate stand from Mamata
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko hi mamata, sonia or rahul kii 10 janpath par meeting tay he
 First Bengal Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary and then Assam Congress President Ripun Bora distanced themselves from Mamata's statements
 ripun bora ne to yahaan tak kah diya qi, mamata kaa ye bayaan aatmghaatee sabit hoga
 After this, two big Congress strategists Ahmed Patel and Ghulam Nabi Azad met her in Parliament House before Mamata went to 10 Janpath on this issue
 sutron ke mutabik, donon netaaon ne mamata se party kii chintaa jaahir kii or bijepi ko siyaasi phayda uthaane kaa mauka nahin mili iskaa khyaal rakhane kii guzarish bhi kii
 Mamta's refrain from visiting Rahul, Rahul will be present only during the meeting with Mamta at Sonia's house - the message that Mamata adopted after coming to Delhi, it was a message that this is the opinion of the entire opposition
 iskebaad congressbacfoot par aa gai
 On one hand, Rahul himself has spoken of not being averse to supporting Mamata for the post of PM
 sonia nahin ab rahul congress adhyaksh hai
 Despite this, Mamta is going to meet UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on '10, Janpath 'when she comes to Delhi
 haalaanki vahaan rahul bhi maujuud rahenge, jis par mamata ko aitraaj nahin he
 It is clear that Mamata still considers Sonia as the top leader of Congress rather than Rahul
 haalanki, congress ko isse philhal dikkat nahin he
 Party strategists feel that right in the name of Sonia, if a leader like Mamata is associated with the Congress in the opposition, it needs opposition solidarity over time
 isiilie rahul ne mamata ke haq main bayaan bhi diya
 Mamta is scheduled to meet Aam Aadmi Party chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday evening as well
 mamata ke is dilli daure kaa ahm makasad tamaam vipakshi netaaon ko agle saal 19 janvari ko hone vaali apni badi raily ke liye nyotaa dena he

 hormuj kii khadi main iran or britain ke bich jari tanaav ke taaja halaat kaa asar aane vaale dinon main puri duniya par dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 Indeed, on July 19, Iran's Revolutionary Guards captured the British flagged oil vessel Stena Impero
 iran ne is tel tanker ko hormuj street se guzarate vakt kabje main le liya
 Britain called it a violation of the international waterway, and the US, Britain, France and NATO called it a violation of navigation rights on the international watershed by Iran
 ab britain ne apane jahaajon kii suraksha ke liye royal navy ke jahaajon ko hormuj street bhej diya he
 Two US warships are already camping in the area
 tanaav kaa ye taaja maamla tab saamne aayaa he jab irani parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar america se bad rahe tanaav ke bich british royal marine ne europea kanoon todane kaa aarope lagaakar isi maheene iran ke ek tanker ‘gres’ ko jibraltar se jabt kar liya tha
 Meanwhile, the US also claimed that its warship stationed in the Gulf of Hormuz killed an Iranian drone
 iran or pashchimi deshon ke bich badhata tanaav khadi kshetra main bade sankat kaa sanket de rahaa he
 And Hormuz Strait is becoming its center
 irani parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar badha tanaviran ke saath antarrashtriya parmaanu samjhauta tuutane ke baad america ne shikanja kasate hue iran ke tel niryaat par may se puri tarah pratibandh laga diya tha
 After this, many countries including India had to stop taking Iranian oil
 iske baad iran ne dhamkee di thi ki yadi uskaa tel roka gaya to hormuj street se kisi bhi desh kaa ek boond tel bhi baahar nahin ja paaegaa
 Importance of the Hormuz Strait The Hormuz Strait is of importance to the entire world for the oil business originating from the Gulf
 yah street iran ke dakshin main faras kii khadi ko oman kii khadi or arab sagar se jodta he
 At its narrowest place, it has a width of 33 kilometers and only 3 kilometers wide route remains for the movement of ships in both directions
 bahrain main tainaat america kaa paanchvaan samudri sainya bedaa is kshetra main vyavsaayik yatayaat kii suraksha karata he
 Iranian activism in this Gulf always remains a threat to the rest of the region's countries
 duniya ke tel kaarobaar kaa kareeb 20 fisadi hissaa is sankare samudri galiyare se gujarata he
 Apart from Iran, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude oil through this route
 duniya main sabase zyada liquid natural gas (alenji) kaa niryaatak desh katar apana lagbhag puraa gas hormuj se hi bhejtaa he
 Most of the oil of Asian countries like japan-india-china-south Korea reaches through this region
 iran-iraq yuddh ke baad se hormuj main kai hamale hote rahe hai
 In addition to catching British tankers this year, Iran has also been accused of assaulting Saudi tankers
 jalakshetra par niyantran ko lekar hameshaa rahaa he tanaavis ilaake se jahaajon kaa avaagaman samudri ilaake main nevigation ke liye bane sanyukt raashtra ke kanoon ke anuroop hota he
 However, tensions rise when many countries refuse to accept them at times
 khaskar hormuj jaldmarumadhya main irani daawey se kai baar tanaav kii sthiti utpann hui he
 Looking back on the past, in April 1959, Iran, extending its claim on the Hormuz Strait, expanded its maritime boundary to 12 nautical miles in the area and declared that international ships would be able to pass through the region only after our permission
 july 1972 main oman ne bhi apni samudri seemaa 12 notical mile badha liya
 With this the Hormuz Strait was completely occupied by both the countries
 haalanki antarrashtriya jahaajon kii awajahi roki nahin gai
 But in May 1993, Iran enacted a law for maritime shipping that violated the UN code
 iske anusaar warship, sabamarine or parmaanu-sampann jahaajon ko irani jalakshetra se guzarane se pehle anumati leni hogi
 When and when did the situation of tension arise? - One day war during 1984 iran-iraq war also affected the movement of ships after Iraqi attacks
 lekin antarrashtriya jahaajon kii awajahi ko lekar hormuj street main pehla sangharsh 1988 main hua jab america ne jahaajon se takaraav ko lekar irani navy ke khilaaf ek din kaa yuddh chhedaa jise oparation preing mantis naam diya
 This operation was conducted by the Iranian Navy on 14 April 1988 by the USS Samuel B
 roberts jahaaj ke aage irani mine lagane ke khilaaf hua
 The American Navy sank an Iranian frigate, a gunboat and 6 armed speedboats
 america ection main iran ke ek duusare frigate ko bhi kaaphi kshati pahunchi
 - Iranian aircraft shot down On July 3, 1988, a US warship stationed in the Hormuz Strait shot down an Iranian passenger plane with a guided missile as a fighter jet
 isamen 290 log maare gaye
 Iran announced to teach America a tough lesson
 - 8 janvari 2007 ko america parmaanu sabamarine uassoes newport pani ke andar se hormuj street hokar guzar rahaa tha tabhi uskaa takkar japani tel tanker emvi mogamigava se ho gaya
 However, there was no oil leak in it nor was anyone injured
 - disambar 2007 se janvari 2008 ke bich hormuj street ke ilaake main tainaat america yudhpot or irani speed boat ke bich takaraav ke kai halaat bane
 After this, accusations in both countries intensified
 - 29 june 2008 ko irani revolutionari gards ne apni nai suraksha niti ghoshit kii or elaan kiya ki agar america or isroyal kii ore se koi bhi hamalaa hota he to ve hormuj street main yatayaat rokkar puri duniya main tel ko lekar aarthik tabaahi machaa denge
 a fifth US warship based in Bahrain crossed the Persian Gulf to respond to the Iranian threat, and the US Navy commander said that we would not allow a third of the world's oil supply system to be held hostage to Iran
 - july 2008 main irani elaan kaa jawaab dene ke liye america ke netritv main kai deshon ke darjanon yudhak jahaaj hormuj street main pahunche or sainya abhyaas kiya
 The practice of Western countries near the coast of Iran created conditions of tension
 agast 2008 main america navy jahaaj kii aguwai main 40 se adhik jahaajon ne hormuj street kii ore rukh kiya
 However, if there was no response from Iran, then the conflict was averted
 - iran par america pratibandh lagane ke baad 2012 main phir ilaake main tanaav bad gaya
 On January 3, 2012, soon after the withdrawal of the American warship from the Gulf of Persia, Iran announced that it would no longer allow its withdrawal and this is the last warning
 jawaab main america navy ne elaan kiya ki uskaa yudhpot jald hi laut rahaa he or jo bhi ise rokegaa uske khilaaf sainya ection hoga
 France also came down against Iran
 europea union se bhi usne iran par lage america pratibandhon ko lagu karne kii apil kii or persia kii khadi main apana atyaadhunik yudhpot bhej diya
 British ships also increased patrolling in the area
 - agast 2018 main irani belistic missile test ke baad daawa kiya gaya ki ab iran ne jahaajon ko target karne kii kshamta hasil kar lee he
 Iran declared that any encroachment in the area would provoke it to take action
 - phir april 2019 main antarrashtriya parmaanu samjhauta tuutane ke baad america ne iran par nae pratibandh lagaae tab se tanaav kaa nayaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 This is followed by the capture of Iranian oil tankers by Britain, Iran's claim of capturing American spies, Iran's claim to kill American drones and then Iran's capture of British oil ships, tensions in the area have increased and may take the form of conflict anytime is
 pashchimi deshon se iran kaa vivaad puranavartmaan main duniya iran ke parmaanu kaaryakramon ko lekar pashchimi duniya se tanaav ke halaat dekh rahi he lekin is ilaake main tanaav kaa itihaas kaaphi purana he
 It began when Iran's Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadik's government was overthrown in the 1950s with US help
 america samarthak mohammad raja pahalavi ke haath main iran kaa shashan aayaa to iran-america kaa sahyog kaa daur bhi duniya ne dekha
 The aftermath of the Islamic revolution deteriorated, but after the Islamic revolution in 1979 and then Ayatollah Khomeini's influence on power, the era of hostility of iran-america started to this day remains intact
 1979 main irani islamic pradarshnakariyon ne tehran sthit america duutavas ko kabje main le liya
 This mortgage crisis continued for 444 days
 1980 se 1988 ke iran-iraq yuddh main bhi iraqi shaasha saddaam hossain ko iran ke khilaaf america kaa puraa samarthan mila
 In all these circumstances, diplomatic relations between Iran and America could not be maintained till today amidst increased tension
 or ab ek baar phir parmaanu samjhauta tuutane ke baad khadi kaa kshetra tanaav kii ore bad rahaa he
 Some of the major extremist attacks of the past in Western Europe are as follows
 
 
 7 janvari, 2015:paris main vyangy patrika sharli hebdo ke karyaalay par bandookdhaari ke hamale main 12 logon kii maut

 BSP chief Mayawati, having forgotten the 24-year-old rivalry, joined hands with Akhilesh Yadav in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vijay rath ko uttar pradesh main donon nahin roak sake
 Due to this, just 12 days after the result of Lok Sabha elections, the BSP had indicated to break the alliance with SP
 ab ravivaar ko jis tarah se mayawati ne akhilesh yadav par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or dhokhebaaji kaa aarope lagaaya he, iske baad donon ke bich dosti kii koi gunjaaish nahin rah jaati he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first time in Mayawati's 35-year political journey when Mayawati has left an alliance
 mayawati alag alag samay par apane raajnneetik phaayde ke hisaab ke gathbandhan karti or todatii rahi hai
 Whether it is to leave Mulayam Singh after the guest house scandal or to withdraw support from Kalyan Singh's government after completing his 6-month term
 iske baad ab loksabhaa chunaav main jiro se 10 siten pahunchane ke baad mayawati ne akhilesh ke sir haar kaa thikra phondte hue gathbandhan todaa
 In such a situation, questions are arising whether Mayawati is doing politics of opportunism once again
 guest house cond ke baad mulaayam se todaa tha nathabaspa kii sthapana 1984 main kanshiram ne kii thi or pehali baar 1993 main gathbandhan ke formule kaa test kiya tha
 The BSP contested the assembly elections in 1993 in Uttar Pradesh in collaboration with Mulayam Singh Yadav's SP
 is chunaav main 'mili mulaayam kanshiram, hawa main ud gaye jai shri ram' kaa naaraa chalaa or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko jabardast phayda mila
 The SP contested on 256 seats and won 109, while the BSP fought on 164 seats and put 67 seats in its account
 gathbandhan satta main aayaa or basapa sarkaar main shaamil hui
 Mulayam Singh Yadav became the Chief Minister, the government also lasted for two years
 mayawati se zyada dekha nahin gaya or 1 june 1995 ko wo mulaayam sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene kii taiyaari karne lageen
 Mulayam Singh got aware of this and only after that on June 2, the guest house scandal in Lucknow, in which many SP mlas and leaders surrounded Mayawati
 iske baad sapa-basapa ke raste alag ho gaye
 On June 3, 1995, Mayawati formed a government with the BJP and became the Chief Minister, a day after she broke up with Mulayam Singh Yadav after the BJP house scandal
 bijepi kii madad se siem rahete hue mayawati ne saarvajanik rup se bijepi netaa purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh par hamalavar raheen
 On 17 October 1995, the BJP withdrew support from the BSP government amidst continuous attacks by Mayawati
 iske baad soobe main raashtrapati shashan lag gaya
 In 1996, after the bsp-congress alliance SP and BJP, the BSP extended a friendship with the Congress
 uttar pradesh main 1996 ke vidhaan sabha chunaav main basapa or congress milakar chunavi maidan main utari, lekin gathbandhan ko koi khaas phayda nahin mila
 The BSP won 66 of the 300 seats and the Congress won 33 of the 125 seats
 dilachasp baat yah he ki soobe main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin milane se sarkaar nahi ban saki or raashtrapati shashan lag gaya
 Mayawati had accused the Congress at the time that it did not get any benefit and broke the alliance
 1997 main bhaajapa se phir milaayaa haathmayawati ne do saal ke baad 1997 main bijepi ke saath ek baar phir haath milaayaa
 For this, the 6-6 months CM formula was agreed between the two parties
 mayawati pehle mukhyamantri bani or apane chah maheene kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad apane pad istipha de diya or kalyaan singh mukhyamantri bane
 Mayawati did not allow Kalyan Singh to function in a month
 unhone kalyaan singh ko dalit virdohi bataate hue unke khilaaf abhiyaan ched diya
 On 10 October 1997, BSP withdrew support from Kalyan Singh government
 haalanki kalyaan singh ne basapa, congress or janata dal ke kai vidhayakon ko todakar sadan main bahumat sabit kar apni sarkaar ko bachaa liya tha
 The Atal government was toppled at the center in 1999, after a 13-month crisis in 1999, the BJP government at the center was hit in 1999
 is dauraan tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se basapa ne vaada kiya ki vishwaas prastaav ke dauraan sarkaar kaa samarthan karegi
 When the discussion on the motion of confidence started in the House and as Mayawati stood up to speak, she said that she is not in support of the government
 iske baad bijepi kii sarkaar gir gai
 In 2002, no party got a majority in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh in 2002, broke from the BJP
 iske baad basapa or bijepi donon partiyon ke bich dhai-dhai saal ke siem formule par sarkaar banane ke liye sahmati hui
 Mayawati became the Chief Minister and resigned after running the government for 1 year 117 days, which gave a major blow to the BJP
 is tarah bijepi se ek baar phir gathbandhan tut gaya
 After this, SP President Mulayam Singh succeeded in forming the government by breaking the BSP mlas
 2018 main karnataka main basapa-jedies gathbandhanabaspa ne 2018 main gathbandhan ke formul par chalane ke liye kadam badhaayaa
 In Karnataka, the BSP contested the assembly elections with the JDS and managed to win one MLA
 22 may 2018 ko karnataka vidhaan chunaav ke nattejey aae, congress or jedies gathbandhan ne satta sanbhali or echdi kumaraswami mukhyamantri bane to basapa bhi sarkaar main shaamil hui eklaute vidhayak ko mantri banaaya gaya
 It was believed that Kumaraswamy's swearing in the behavior of Sonia Gandhi and Mayawati was so close that the BSP would contest elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in alliance with the Congress, talks were going on between the two parties
 isi bich mayawati ne teenon rajyon main congress ke saath gathbandhan nahin karne kaa elaan kar diya or karnataka sarkaar se apane mantri kaa istipha dilaa diya
 SP-BSP alliance BSP contested in Uttar Pradesh with SP in 144 days Lok Sabha election
 janvari main gathbandhan ne seat shering formule kaa kaa elaan kiya
 BSP fought on 38 and SP 37 seats
 baaki seat areldi ke khate main gai
 The results of the election did not go the way both parties had thought
 basapa ko 10 or sapa ko 5 siten mili
 Mayawati finally broke the alliance, questioning Akhilesh Yadav
 is tarah se 24 saal kii dushmani ko bhulaakar ek hue sapa-basapa phir alag ho gaye
 The BSP broke alliances in other states as well
 BSP had fought in Lok Sabha elections along with several parties

 rio olympic main bhagidaari ko lekar kanoonee ladaai lard rahe pahalwaan susheel kumaar ko dilli hai court se raahat nahin mili he
 The court said that it would not interfere with the decision of the Federation
 court kaa faisla sunne ke baad susheel kumaar ke vakil ne court ko kaha ki unhen apni yachika waapas lene di jaae lekin court ne kaha ki ab order sin ho chukaa he lihaaja yachika ab waapas nahin kii ja sakati
 After hearing the arguments, the court said, "sushil is a great player, but the Wrestling Federation's argument that Narsingh Yadav is in better form and the decision to send him to the Olympics is right
" 'susheel kumaar ne lagaaya tha aropsusheel kumaarane yachika di thi ki rio olympic ke liye chune gaye narsingh yadav ke saath olympic main jane se pehle donon kaa muqabla karaayaa jaae
 Sushil alleged that the Wrestling Federation discriminated against Narsingh Yadav
 dilli hai court ke somvaar ke aadesh ke baad saaf ho gaya ki pahalwaan susheel kumaar auranrsingh yadavake bich rio olympic main bharat ke taraf se koun jayega
 Sushil did not practice with the Indian players
 During the last two weeks of the hearing, Sushil and Narsingh also presented their strength in the court as the claimants of this trial
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court raceling federation ke vaais president raaj singh ke halafname main di galat jaankaree se naaraaz dikhaa, to yah baat bhi saamne ai ki bharat sarkaar ke kharche par georgia gaye susheel ne bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath practice nahin kii
 He was practicing there with Georgia players which is against the rules
 hai court ne jataai naaraazgihai court is baat se bhi naaraaz dikhaa ki raceling federation or khilaadiyon kii raajnneeti ko court main ghasita ja rahaa he
 While at this time he should have focused on his game
 susheel ke vakil ne court ko kaha ki international raceling main susheel ke kaamyaab hone ke chance zyada hai
 He is the only Indian Wrestler to have won the Gold Medal for India
 narsingh ke paas wo anubhav nahin he jo susheel ke paas he, isliye agar rio olympic main susheel ko bheja jaataa he, to bharat ke jeetne ke chance bad jaaenge
 Sushil's lawyer told the Gherakikil that the trial is also required 1 month before the Wrestling Federation rules
 trial 13 maheene pehle karaayaa gaya he, jisaki koi vaidhata nahin he
 How can Sushil Kumar be kept away from the Olympics, if he refuses to participate in any private championship, then it cannot be a condition of making it to the Olympics
 federation ne narsingh ko bataaya behetarraceling federation ne kaha ki 2015 se susheel kumaar ne kisi trial main bhaag hi nahin liya
 Sushil Kumar's preparation is not better than Narasimha Yadav's
 narsingh yadav sitambar 2015 se taiyaari kar rahaa he

 wo duniya kii 100 sabase taqatvar mahilaon main se ek hai
 Like last three years, ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar has been chosen among the 100 most powerful women in the world this year
 ek safal kaamkaaji mahila ke taur par to unhen har koi jaanata he lekin unki nijee jindagi ke bare main kam hi logon ko pataa he
 Where she plays a mother, a daughter, a wife, a daughter-in-law
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki kaamkaaji auraten apane bacchon par puraa dhyaan nahin de paati hai lekin chanda kochar kii ye chitthee padhakar aapaki bhi raay badal jaaegi
 He has written this letter in the name of his daughter Aarti
 sudhaa menon dwaara likhi kitaab "ligesiah letters from eminant parents tu der dotrs" main unka ye khat prakashit hua he jise padhakar aap bhi bhavuk hue bina nahin rah paaenge
 Dear Aarti, i feel proud to see you today as a ready and confident girl for this new journey in life
 aane vaale saalon main main tumhen tarakkee karte hue dekhnaa chaahati hum
 My own memories have come alive after seeing you today
 yaadon ke saath hi wo sari baaten, wo sabak jo maine bachapan main siikhe the
 When i think about that time, i find that most of the things and lessons i learned from my parents
 bachapan main jo mulya unhone mujhe sikhaye or dieunheen kii neenv par main aaj khadi hum
 The three of us have never been discriminated against
 chaahe padhai kii baat ho yaa bhavishya kii yojanaon kii, kabhi koi fark nahin kiya gaya
 He always said that we should work diligently in the same direction with which we get satisfaction
 bachapan main sikhaayi gai inhen baton ne hamen apana faisla khud lene ke kaabil banaaya
 This one lesson helped me to identify myself and find myself
 main sirf 13 saal kii thi, jab hamaare pita ko achaanak dil kaa daura padaa or wo hamen akelaa chhodkar chale gaye
 We had never faced any challenges till his stay
 par us raat ke baad, bina kisi purv soochna ke sabakuch badal gaya
 My mother, who was a housewife till now, had the responsibility of raising three children alone
 tab hamen pataa chalaa ki wo kitni majboot thim
 Gradually, he prepared himself for textile designing and joined a small firm
 kuch hi dinon main unhone khud ko ek praasangik shaks bana liya
 It must have been very difficult for him to take responsibility for the whole family alone but he never let us realize this
 unhone tab tak kadi mehnat kii,jab tak ham sab college kii padhai puri kar apane pairon par khadey nahin ho gaye
 i never knew that my mother trusted herself so much
 agar aap phulatime job karne vaali maa yaa pita hai to aapke kaam kaa asar aapke parivaar or rishte par nahin padana chahie
 Remember that time when you were studying in America and there were reports in all the newspapers about my becoming the MD and CEO of ICICI Bank? You mailed me two days later in which you wrote to me, 'you never let us feel that your career can be so stressful and so brilliant
 ghar par aap sirf hamaari maa thim,’ tum apni jindagi ko vaise hi jeena
 i learned one more thing from my mother that it is most important to have the strength to keep going through the difficulties, no matter what
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he ki kitne dhairya ke saath unhone papa ke jane ke baad sab sambhaal liya tha
 You have to face all the difficulties, win with them, not let them dominate you
 mujhe yaad he ki 2008 ke aakhir main global economic meltdown ke dauraan isiaisiai bank ko bachaae rakhana kitna mushkil ho gaya tha
 All the big media houses were speculating about our situation from a distance, debates were being made about us everywhere
 main kaam par lag gai, chote se chote paisa jamaa karne vaale se lekar bade inwestors tak, sabase baat kii
 Talked from regulators to the government
 bank pareshaani main nahin tha, par main stekholders kii pareshaani bhi samajhati thi, kyonki kaiyon ko dar tha ki unka paisa khatre main he
 i advised the staff of every branch to listen to the satisfaction of every investor who came to withdraw money from the bank
 agar koi apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahaa he, to unhen baithne ko kursi or pine ko pani den or haa, bhale hi logon ko bank se apana paisa nikaalane kii puri aazaadee thi, par hamaare staff ne unhen samajhaayaa ki aisa karne se unhen koi phayda nahin hoga, kyonki darasal chrysis kii koi baat nahin thi
 It is a matter of those difficult days, when one day i took two hours leave for your brother's squash tournament
 us vakt mujhe andaja nahin tha, par us din mere vahaan hone se bank ke customers kaa ham par bharosa majboot hua tha
 Some mothers came to me and asked if i was Chanda Kochhar of ICICI, and when i answered yes, their next question was how to find time for the game during such a crisis? He was convinced that if i am taking time out for the game, the bank is in the right hands and there is no need to be afraid of my money
 maine apni maa se paristhitiyon ke hisaab se dhalanaa bhi siikhaa
 i also took care of my family while working hard for my career
 jab bhi meri maa or mere sasuraal waalon ko meri jarurat hui, main unke saath thi
 He also supported me and helped me to take my career forward
 yaad rakhana, rishte behad jaruri hai or hamen unka khyal rakhana chahie
 Also remember that relationships are not one-sided, so you should be ready to give what you expect from the person in front of you
 aaj meraa kariyar jahaan he, vahaan kabhi nahin pahunch paata, agar tumhaare papa mere saath na hote
 He never complained to me about being out of the house
 ham donon hi apane kariyar main vyast the lekin phir bhi ham donon ne apane rishte ko kamjor nahin padane diya
 i am sure that you will do the same with your partner when the time comes
 agar tumne bhi mere mere ghar se kaaphi samay tak baahar rahane ko lekar shikaayat kii hoti to main kabhi apane liye kariyar banane kii himmat nahin juta paati
 i am fortunate to have such a smart and supportive family
 mujhe yakeen he ki jab tum apana parivaar banaaogi, tum bhi itani hi bhaagyashaalee rahogi
 i remember when your board exams were about to start
 maine chuttee lee thi taaki main tumhen khud exam dilaane le ja sakuun
 Then you told me how many years you had to go alone for the exam
 ye sunakar mujhe mujhe bahut dukh hua tha
 But i also felt that due to being the daughter of a working mother, you have become self-sufficient very soon
 tum sirf samajhadaar hi nahin hui, balki tumne apane chote bhai kaa bhi dhyaan rakhaa
 You never let me miss you
 maine bhi tum par bharosa karnaa, tumme vishwaas rakhana siikhaa or ab tum ek majboot, aatmanirbhar mahila ban gai ho
 i now adopt the same principle in my company
 main bhagya main bharosa rakhti hum lekin iske saath hi is baat ko bhi maanati hum ki kadi mehnat kii hamaari jindagi main bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 In a big way, we all write our own luck
 apni kismat ko apane haathon main lo, jo paanaa chaahate ho uskaa khwab dekho or ise apane mutabik likho
 Many times you will have to take difficult decisions while moving forward
 aise faisle jo shaayad dusron ko pasand na aaen lekin tumme itani himmat honi chahie ki tum uske liye khadi ho sako jisamen tumhaara vishwaas he
 Keep in mind that you should have the courage to do what you think is right
 aarti, drudh ichha shakti se kuch bhi paaya ja saktaa he, isaki seemaa nahin, par apane lakshya ke peeche jate vakt apni eemaandaaree or mulyon se samjhauta mat karnaa
 Respecting the feelings of those around you
 yaad rakhana ki acha or bura, donon tarah kaa vakt jindagi main baraabar aata he
 You have to learn to take it the same way
 jindagi jo avasar de, uskaa puraa phayda uthaao or har avasar, har chunauti se sikhti raho
 Your love mama apadet :khabar publish hone ke baad airtel ne kaha he ki 150 rupee main 28GB data vaali khabar galat he or aisa kii bhi pack yugers ko nahin diya ja rahaa he
 According to the company such reports are false
 haalanki is report se pehle india today tech ne airtel se baat kii thi tab unhone aisa nahin kaha tha
 This report was first reported by Telecom Talk
 baharhaal ab 13 march ko hi saaf hoga ki company sarprise ofer ke taur par customers ko kitna data degi
 We made this news earlier based on reports
 
 Data war has started in telecom companies since the arrival of Reliance Jio
 airtel desh kii number-1 telecom company he or sabase zyada nuksaan isi kaa hua he
 In such a situation, the company does not want to leave any effort to protect users from the data offer
 haal hi main airtel ke siio ne kaha he ki postped yugers ko sarprise ofer ke tahat extra free data diya jayega
 According to reports, the company is preparing to launch a Rs 150 plan for its postpaid users, in which 28GB data will be given every month
 telecom tok kii report ke mutabik darasal yah booster pack hoga jise holi ke maukey par shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 Because the company has said that from March 13, postpaid users will be given surprise offers through the My Airtel app
 haal hi main airtel ne apane chuninda yugers ke liye 345 rupee kaplan pesh kiya he jisamen 28GB dataor analimited colling diya ja rahaa he
 However it will be given 500MB for day and 500MB for night
 reports ke mutabik yah booster pack bhi sharton ke saath aayega
 According to this, 14GB data can be used during the day while 14GB data can be used from 3AM to 5AM at night
 is ofer kii khaas baat yah hogi ki ye sabhi postped yugers ke liye diya ja saktaa he
 Since the offer of Rs 345 taken by prepaid users has not been received by everyone
 abhi bhi kai yugers is ofer ko nahin actevet kara paae hai
 Significantly, the Booster Pack will be applicable on any postpaid plan
 yani agaraapane 499 rupee kaa plan le rakhaa haito isamen 3GB data miltaa he or agar yah ofer aayaa to 150 rupee dekar kul 31gb data aapako mil saktaa he
 For this, you have to spend a total of Rs 649
 tex alag se hai
 However, despite these plans, Reliance Jio's prime plans are better in terms of data
 kyonki isamen 303 rupee main 28GB data he or shuruuaat main 5GB extra data diya jayega

 In such a situation, a big news has come about former captain Nahindra Singh Dhoni (MS Dhoni)
 gaiyr manyata praapt bihar cricket sangh ke sachiv aditya verma ne is baar mahendra singh dhoni ko lekar nayaa khulaasa kiya he
 According to him, Dhoni has not relinquished the captaincy but he has been rescued from them
 verma ke anusaar, dhoni par dabaav daalaa gaya jiske chalate unhone captaini tyaag di
 Aditya Verma is giving the reason behind this to Amitabh Chaudhary, Joint Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 aditya verma ke mutabik, choudhary ne dhoni se jharkhand ke liye semifinal khilne ke liye kaha tha lekin chunki maahi pehle hi is formet se sanyas le chuke hai isliye unhone isse inkaar kar diya or team ke saath mentor ke taur par jud gaye
 According to Verma, after losing the semi-final to Gujarat in Jharkhand, Amitabh phoned the chief selector MSK Prasad to ask him about Dhoni's future and Dhoni announced his retirement from the captaincy
 
 The comments haalanki aditya verma dwaara lagaae gaye in aaropon kii NDTV pushti nahin karata
 NDTV had a phone conversation with Verma claiming that all these things were true
 aditya verma ke mutabik, amitabh choudhary or dhoni ke rishton ko lekar puure jharkhand cricket main sabhi ko jaankaree he
 When NDTV telephoned Amitabh Chaudhary, former president of Jharkhand Cricket Association, he did not respond
 amitabh choudhary ne unako kiye gaye massej kaa bhi jawaab nahin diya
 Let us tell you that the chief selector MSK Prasad had completely given the decision of Mahendra Singh Dhoni to leave the captaincy
 prasad pehle bhi dhoni ko apni captaini par khud faisalaa lene kii baat bhi kah chuke the

 aditya verma is sabake peeche bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke jwoint secretary amitabh choudhary ko vajah bataa rahe hai
 According to Aditya Verma, Chaudhary had asked Dhoni to play the semi-finals for Jharkhand but since Mahi had already retired from this format, he refused it and joined the team as a mentor

 According to Aditya Verma, everyone knows about the relationship of Amitabh Chaudhary and Dhoni in the entire Jharkhand cricket

 Operating ratio of Railways 98 in FY 2018
 44% tak pahunchisase pehle vitt varsh 2001 main yah reshio 98
 At 3 per cent, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) is in the discussion about Indian Railways for the last few days
 darasal, kaig kii report main bataaya gaya he ki bhartiya railway kii kamai beete 10 saalon main sabase nichle str par pahunch chuki he
 According to the latest report, the operating ratio of the railway is 98 in FY 2018
 44 fisadi tak pahunch chukaa he
 This means that in the financial year 2017-18, the Railways spent 98 rupees 44 paise to earn 100 rupees
 yani is dauraan railway ko sirf 1 rupee 56 paise kaa munafa hua
 If you look at the figures of the past, then the operating ratio of the Railways, the operating ratio has been fluctuating
 lekin vitt varsh 2018 main railway ke oparating reshio main badhotaree sambhavat: sabase buree he
 Earlier, operating ratio 98 in FY 2001

 Good Operating Ratio During the early years of 1950–1970, Indian Railways maintained a healthy operating ratio
 varsh 1950-51 main, oparating reshio 81 fisadi ke str par tha
 This means that the Railways then spent 81 rupees to earn 100 rupees
 yani is dauraan railway ko 19 rupee kaa munafa hua tha, jo us vakt ke halaat ke mutabik behatar sthiti thi
 Similarly, the operating ratio increased to 78 by 1960-61
 75 fisadi ho gaya
 That is, the Railways spent Rs 100 to 21
 25 rupee kaa munafa kamaaya
 And then fluctuations
 
 
 
 However 10 years later in 1970–71, the operating ratio deteriorated and it was 84
 13 fisadi par aa gaya
 This means that the railways used to save more than 16 paise for every 1 rupee
 iske baavjood tab ke halaat ko dekhte hue railway kii sthiti thik kahi ja sakati he
 The operating ratio of Indian Railways fluctuated between the years 1980 and 2000
 vitt varsh 1981 main oparating reshio 96
 91 per cent in FY 1991, which was at 07 per cent
 97 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 However, in 1996 and 1997, Railways started showing better results and 82 in their operating ratios respectively
 45 fisadi or 86
 Improved by 25 percent
 lekin vitt varsh 1998 or 2001 ke bich railway ke oparating reshio main phir ijapha hone laga or yah kramshah 90
 9%, 93
 3%, 93
 3%, 98
 3% tak pahunch gaya
 Which is a poor performance from a business perspective
 lagaataar 6 saal tak sudhaarhalanki vitt varsh 2002 se 2008 ke bich railway ke oparating reshio main lagaataar 6 saal tak sudhaar hua
 Operating ratio 96 in FY 2002
 6 fisadi tha to vahiin saal 2008 main yah sudhar kar 75
 Reached 94 percent
 lekin vitt varsh 2009 main oparating reshio ek baar phir bighad kar 90
 Came down to 46 percent
 vitt varsh 2010 se ab tak railway ke oparating reshio kii baat karen to sabase behatar 2013 kaa saal rahaa
 Operating ratio 90 this year
 2 fisadi par tha
 Performance of Railways from 2014 till now Operating ratio 93 in FY 2014
 6 fisadi par tha
 91 in FY 2015
 25 fisadi rahaa
 While the operating ratio 90 in FY16
 48 fisadi par tha
 The operating ratio of the railways increased to 96 in the last two financial years
 5 fisadi or 98
 4 per cent, which is a matter of concern
 yahaan bataa den ki beete farvari maheene main vitt mantri piyush goyal ne antarim bajet pesh karte hue railway ke oparating reshio main sudhaar kii baat kahi thi
 He said that the operating ratio 96 in the year 2018-19

 jo aaj dilli ke mukhyamantri hai, unhen congress ne nayak banaaya to aaj jeenyu chaatr sangh adhyakshakanhaiya kumarako bijepi kii raajnneeti ne hero bana diya
 The campaign of both is 'independence' and the development of the common man
 aaie, in aath points main jane kyon ek-duje se milte-julate hai kejariwal or kanhaiya-1
 Connection of Congress and BJP- Arvind Kejriwal became famous in every corner of the country from Delhi and emerged as an effective politician
 kejariwal raajnneeti main aae uske liye kahin na kahin congress haath he
 Kejriwal, who raised his voice against the policies of Congress in Delhi, was taken up by the people of the country
 - kanhaiya kumaar ne jeenyu ke andar aresas or bijepi ke badhate dakhal ko mudda banaaya
 The BJP and its student organization ABVP have been instrumental in exposing Kanhaiya's name in the recent anti-national program
 2
 Been a hero through both movements - Arvind Kejriwal was raised by Anna Hazare's Janlokpal movement
 - kanhaiya kumaar kojeenyu main rashtravadaur rashtradroh ladaai ne hero banaaya
 3
 kejariwal ne bhi yahi kaha tha--anna andolan ke samay kejariwal ne lagbhag baar raajnneeti main aane ke sawaal par yahi kaha tha ki vah raajnneeti karne nahin aae hai
 He will not join the mainstream of politics
 haalanki baad main vah anna se alag ho gaye or party bana lee
 Kanhaiya Kumar also said in his first speech after his release from jail that he does not want to become a leader
 vah teacher bananaa chaahate hai
 However, the JNU controversy has eased his political path
 4
 Both came into the discussion with the freedom movement - Kejriwal had waged a campaign to eradicate corruption from the country and get freedom from corruption, and even after assuming power in Delhi, he has been repeating this thing continuously
 - kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha he ki vah desh se nahin balki desh main aazaadee chaahate hai
 He wants to liberate the country from poverty, hunger, discrimination
 5
 Moved with the fight of the people - Arvind Kejriwal entered politics by giving a slogan for the fight for the rights of the common man
 - kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha ki vah aam chaatro kaa ladaai lard rahe hai or chaahate hai ki sabhi padhein or unki tarah aage badhen
 6
 donon tihaad jail gaye- arvind kejariwal ko kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kii manahani ke maamle main patiala house court ne may 2014 main nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bheja tha
 Kanhaiya Kumar was sent to Tihar Jail in judicial custody by the Patiala House Court on February 9 for being involved in the alleged anti-national incident in JNU
 philhal kanhaiya antarim jamaanat par reeha hue hai
 7
 saadagi hi pahchaan- kejariwal apni saadagi ke liye kaaphi charchaa main rahe hai
 Kejriwal's dress code has also become his identity
 - kanhaiya kii saadagi bhi logon ke saamne he
 Even after becoming the President of the Students' Union, he did not have the same courage as all the student leaders
 8
 Right now against both the BJP- whether to regain power in Delhi or the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal's fight shifted from Congress to BJP
 desh kii rajdhani main tamaam prashasnic muddon par kejariwal or bijepi kii ladaai khulkar saamne bhi aa chuki he
 The battle of Kanhaiya is also against the BJP making the issue of so-called anti-national activities in JNU
 jail se reeha hone ke baad bhi kanhaiya kii baton main aresas or bijepi ke khilaaf gussa saaf dikhaa he
 The anti-national sloganeering at the JNU campus in Delhi on 9 February has been the subject of much anti-national and anti-sedition
 maamle main jeenyu chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ke saath hi kuch anya chaatro par is babat cese bhi chal rahaa he
 But the technology dilemma among all this is that if you search Anti National and Sedition on Google Maps, then you see a map of Jawaharlal Nehru University
 gauratlab he ki afjal guru par kaarykram ke aayojan or desh virdohi narebaaji ko lekar dilli police ne kanhaiya kumaar ko arest kiya tha
 Apart from them, students named Anirban Bhattacharya and Umar Khalid were also arrested
 in sabhi par Sedition yani rajdroh kaa maamla chal rahaa he or abhi teenon jamaanat par reeha hai
 In this whole case, these students were termed as 'anti national' ie 'traitors' by the large sections of the country and criticized them
 soshal media ke saath-saath puure desh main is vishay par bahes bhi chhidi rahi, vahiin ab google maps main Anti National (raashtra virdohi) or Sedition (rajdroh) search karne par JNU kaa nakshaa dikh rahaa he
 Cyber law expert Pawan Duggal says that the whole matter is of computer network disturbances
 unhone kaha ki yah ek aintensional blendar he

 a day before Akhilesh's visit to Jhansi, Shivpal's son Aditya Yadav and other leaders also visited Pushpendra's house and met the kin of the victim
 shivpal ko sadhana or unke sahare bhi yadav vot bank ko sanjona akhilesh ke liye badi chunauti he
 Senior political analyst Prem Shankar Mishra says, "like the Yadav belt seats like Firozabad, Etawah, Badaun, Ballia, which were considered to be sp's strongholds in the Lok Sabha elections
 vahaan par chunaav haarana sapa ke liye nuksaandeh rahaa he
 The original vote bank of the SP has lost a lot in this election
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam kaa niskriy hona or shivpal kaa duusari party bana lenaa bhi kaaphi hanikaarak rahaa he
 That is why Akhilesh is now engaged in practicing it
 vah em-vaai kambination ko bhi durust karne main jute gaye hai
 "another analyst says Rajiv Srivastava," The way the BJP got about 50 to 51 percent vote share in the Lok Sabha elections, it contained the vote of all castes
 abhi tak dalit kor vot jatav kahin nahin khiskaa, isi kaaran mayawati nishcint hai
 BJP has infiltrated the vote bank of all castes
 akhilesh ke saamne chhitake vot ko apane paale main laana badi chunauti he
 For this reason Ramakant Yadav is included
 unke paas purvachal kaa bada vot bank he
 The SP has been doing caste-based politics
 agar ye vot khisak gaye to sanghathan ko khadaa karnaa bhi mushkil hoga
 That is why Akhilesh Yadav is engaged in promoting the vote bank
 "unhone kaha, "mulaayam singh ek aise netaa the, jinhen yadav voter apane abhibhavak ke taur main dekhte the
 He used to make plans and take care of the Yadavas elsewhere
 uske baad agar kisi kaa naam aata he to vah he shivpal kaa
 He has also been a favorite among activists
 vah apane votaron kii chintaa karte the
 That is why these two are considered to be grassroots leaders

 pune ke ek mashhoor fishan digining institute kii ek student kii maut kaa ye ek aisa ajeebogareeb maamla he, jisane medical science ke jaankaron ke saath-saath dhakad pulisavaalon tak, sabhi ko hairat main daal diya he
 This joy of Sanam, who is pursuing a course in fashion designing from Symbiosis Institute, Pune, is doubled when her parents themselves travel from Mumbai to Pune to wish her a happy birthday
 pehle ghar main ek choti si party hoti he or phir iske baad sanam ke dost uske liye ek sarprise party kaa elaan karte hai
 The housemates are also unaware about this surprise party, but after losing the daughter's happiness and the insistence of friends, her parents allow Sanam to have a nightout, but the news that the Hassan family would receive later in the morning Is, everyone's senses fly away from him
 phone par par sanam ke dost uske gharavaalon ko khabar dete hai ki sanam kii tabiyat behad kharaab he or isliye use aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya he
 On receiving the news of his lonely ladli being suddenly ill, the housemates arrive directly at the Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune, but the world's most wretched news awaits them here
 ye khabar he, sanam kii maut kii
 Till a few hours ago, with all the laughing, well-meaning and happy Sanam, what happened suddenly that she got upset with the world in this way
 ye ladki jab apane doston kii taraf se di gai sarprise berth de party main shaamil hone gai thi, to behad khush thi
 She kept celebrating till late night and during this time she also had a conversation with some relatives but the sun of her life had sunk as the morning sun rose
 uski maut ho chuki thi
 After all, what was the reason for Sanam's death, because the girl who was tweeting in the happiness of her birthday till just one night ago
 uske saath raaton-raat aisa kya ho gaya ki achaanak uski jaan hi chali gai
 This question was continuously troubling the Hasan family
 unhone iske bare main sanam ke doston or aspataal se bhi poochtacha kii lekin unhen jo bhi jawaab mili, wo unke gale nahin utar rahe the
 Sanam's friends told him that suddenly his health deteriorated at night and he started having vomiting and then he got Sanam admitted to Ruby Hall Clinic, but the question was if Sanam's health deteriorated during the party at night itself
 Then, why did his friends not inform about this to Sanam's parents, while the Hassan family were present in Pune then
 sawaal ye bhi tha ki uske doston ne use partiwali jagah se dur rubi haul clinics main kyon bharti karavaaya, jabaki paas hi or bhi kai duusare aspataal the
 Apparently, Sanam's family members could not get any answer to these questions, which would have comforted them, but what happened after that was even more strange
 aspataal se mili sanam ke medical report main bataaya gaya tha ki sanam kaa maut jarurat se zyada nasha karne ke chalate dil kaa daura padane kii vajah se hui
 The medical report also said that Sanam had blockage in his heart
 yani ye report ishara kar rahi thi ki sanam ko dil kii beemaari thi, lekin sanam ke gharavaale is baat ko bhi maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the kyonki awwal to sanam kii aisi koi medical history nahin thi or doosraa ye ki wo ek sports girl thi
 Therefore, he was not ready to accept that he had a heart ailment
 ye baaten maanon jaise sawaalon kii shuruyaat bhar thi
 When the family members looked deeply into the hospital records, they came to know that Sanam was admitted to the hospital at nine and a half hours, but on the same report of Sanam, it was telling that Sanam's same life was at 8
52 in the morning
 Got it done
 yani aspataal main bhartee karne ke 38 minute pehle lekin ye bhala kaise mumkin tha
 Obviously, there was something in this case, which some people related to this case were trying to hide
 us vakt to bhare man se hasan parivaar ne sanam kii laash ko dafan kar diya, lekin iske baad saamne ai postmortem report ne jaise puure maamle ko hi palat kar rakh diya
 Or rather say that the things recorded in this report were utterly impossible from the perspective of medical science in terms of common sense
 sanam kii maut kii ye paheli uski postmortem report main chhipi thi kyonki ye postmortem report hi thi, jisane puure maamle ko bilkul sir ke bal ulat kar diya tha
 It was only the post mortem report, which was telling that Sanam, who was a girl till her death, had become a boy after her death
 lekin ye aakhir kaise mumkin tha
 It was a case of mysterious death of a well-to-do girl
 sanam kii laash ko rubi haul aspataal se postmortem ke liye sasun aspataal main bhijwa diya gaya
 The doctors did her post-mortem here, but reserved her opinion till the viscera report came
 saaf he doctor ye jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir sanam ne us raat party main koi jahrili cheez to nahin kha lee
 Doctors had kept parts of his body safe for viscera examination, but a few days later when the viscera report came out, all the people along with the policemen who were investigating the case came into the can
 is report main tamaam duusari baton ke saath-saath ek aisi ajeeb baat likhi thi, jo kisi bhi surat main mumkin nahin tha or naa hi medical science main isse pehle kabhi aisi koi baat suni hi gai thi
 It was a matter of having a man's heart in the chest of Sanam
 postmortem report main sanam ke dil ko purush kaa dil hi bataaya gaya tha, lekin ye bhala kaise mumkin tha
 How could a boy's heart beat well in a girl's chest, and instead of solving this matter of death, it confused something that the mind of the policeman also wandered
 ye report bataati thi ki sanam ke dil kaa 70 fisadi hissaa block padaa hua tha
 That is, the blood in the heart was not running properly
 itnaa hi nahin, report ke mutabik uske seene main takreeban teen centimetre ke ek gahare nishaan ke alaava use chaar injection lagaae jane kii baat bhi likhi thi
 It is evident that Sanam's viscera report proves that something must have happened while keeping it safe, due to which viscera has been changed or changed but if this was true, then what is the motive behind doing so
 sawaal uthta he ki kya sanam kii maut aam maut nahin thi
 Did he die and someone changed Visra to confuse the case
 sanam kii maut ek aisi paheli ban kar rah gai he, jiskaa jawaab philhal kisi ke paas nahin he
 The biggest question is how the viscera of Sanam's corpse changed
 kya ye mahaj ek ittefaq he yaa phir iske peeche koi gahari sajeesh he
 Now in this case Sanam's family members were convinced that Sanam's death is not just an accident, but he has been killed and now in the changing circumstances Sanam's family suspects him of the police, his friends and even the hospital people Was also started happening
 darasal, berth-de party ke dauraan raat ko kareeb do bajkar bees minute par uske mamaa ne use phone kar janmdin kii badhai di thi
 Apparently, Sanam was safe till then, but when Sanam's aunt sent her a message about Birthday Wish at four in the morning, she did not respond
 yani tab tak uski tabiyat bighad chuki thi
 In such a situation, the question was why then his friends did not tell this thing to his family
 kahin uske doston main koi aisa to nahin tha, jisane sanam ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi or agar rachi bhi to is tarah ek ladki kii jaan lene kaa makasad kya ho saktaa tha
 Sanam's viscera had already changed
 lekin maamle ko crosschek karne ke liye lihaaj se isaki jaanch kar rahi siaidi ne isaki diene jaanch karwaane kaa faisla kiya or is koshish main bhi vahi baat saamne ai, jo pehle hi saaf ho chuki thi
 Visra's DNA did not match with the Hasan couple
 yani visra sanam kaa tha hi nahin
 Similarly, the viscera had no match with other samples of Sanam's body and was pointing to a deeper conspiracy
 gharavaalon kaa to yahaan tak kahana he ki sanam ke doston main se ek kaa pita sasun aspataal main hi kaam karata he, kahin aisa to nahin ki usee ne apane bete ko bachaane ke iraade se sanam kaa visra badal diya ho
 Sanam's family members are not too secret from Pune Police's Kahili

 jaise hi vah rais gharaane ke bacchon ko skating karte hue dekhtaa he, uski ankhon main bhi nae sapane jaagane lagate hai or phir shuru hoti he, jaagti ankhon se dekhe gaye un sapanom ko puraa karne kii jaddojahad
 
 
 Accompanying her in fulfilling this dream of skating is a skating teacher and four poor street children, who are her friends
 
 
 nirdeshak amol gupte ne pehle 'taare zameen par' kii thi, jisamen bacchon kii shiksha ke bare main dikhaaya gaya
 
 
 After that Amol Gupte created 'stanley Ki Dibba', in which he again emphasized the children's story
 
 
 ab ek baar phir amol gupte bacchon ke sapanom ko film 'hawa hawaii' ke jariye saamne laae hai
 
 
 It is clear that Amol is not only exposing the issues of children, but also explains them in the best way through his film
 
 
 sadak ke garib bachche kis tarah mehnat-mazaduri kar skating ke juute banaate hai
 
 
 How a teacher gives skating training

 "that is, this film gives the message that there is happiness only after suffering and those who try never give up
 
 
 kul milakar 'hawa hawaii' ek khubasurat film he, jisamen rishte, jajbaat, maasoomiyat or jaagti ankhon se aasmaan chune kaa junun nazar aata he

 India is now becoming a graveyard of glowing brands and companies
 satyam, adieji (anil ambani samooh), videokon, sahaara, modiluft, rotomac, jepi samooh, neerav modi, gitanjali james, jet airways, kingfisher, unitech, amrapali, ielandeeyes, sterling biotech, bhushan steel
 
 
 This list can be quite long
 
 
 tata, fortis or infosis ke board main vivaadon yaa cafe coffee de main sankat se hue nuksaan (share keemat) ko jodne ke baad hamen achaanak mahasoos hoga ki bharat ke nijee pravartak to kahin zyada bade atmaghati hai
 Why does management of a company or poor corporate governance not matter to us? Bad management of companies is just as deadly as a bad government
 sarkaar ko to phir bhi badla ja saktaa he lekin companiyon ke prabandhan ko badalanaa asambhav he
 The large number of companies that have suffered due to poor corporate governance in India , or the wealth and prosperity of the promoters, and the mistakes and mistakes of the promoters, is no less than that caused by the recession
 darasal, yah tihara vinaash he
 One-share investors lose their capital
 jaise, kuch saal pehle tak diggaj (arcom, videokon, unitech, vodaphone, sujalon) companiyon ke share ab ek do rupye main mil rahe hai
 Two - these sink the capital of banks (pnb-nirav Modi) which is actually the savings of the common people and the third - sudden bursting unemployment like Jet Airways, rcom, Uninor
 desh main korporate gavarnence yani company ko chalaane ke niyam kaagajon par duniya main sabase sakht hone ke baavjood ghotaalon kii jhadi lagi he
 The functioning of the boards of directors of companies are deeply opaque
 inhen thik karne kaa jimmaa pravartakon par he, jinaki board main tuuti bolti he
 Corporate governance in these companies opened up only after a dispute in Indigo or Fortis
 tata sans ke board ne sires mistre ko shandaar chairman bataane ke kuch maah baad hi hataa diya
 Infosys' board of directors, sometimes Vishal Sikka, became a supporter of former promoter Narayan Murthy and investors were deeply hurt during this time
 videokon ko galat dhang se karj dene ke baad bhi chanda kochar isiisiaai main bani raheen
 Yes Bank MD Rana Kapoor had to be removed or that IL&FS circulated the money through numerous subsidiaries and the board kept sleeping
 najiren or bhi hai
 Promoters take over companies because independent directors become inefficient, regulators continue to crumble, no accountability is fixed and suddenly one day the company becomes history
 bhartiya companiyon ke pramotor, paise or bank karj ke galat istemaal ke liye kukhyat ho rahe hai
 The forensic audit of Amrapali revealed that the owners created more than 27 companies in the name of peons and lower employees, which were used for rigging
 taqatvar pramotor, bank, reating agenciyon or audit ke saath milakar ek cartil banaate hai jo tabhi najar aata he jab company karj main chookti yaa duubati he jaisaa ki ielandeeyes main hua
 The list of promoters' losses and losses from wrong decisions (eg Tata Nano, Kingfisher) is also long
 jald se jald bade ho jane ke laalach main bhartiya udhyami bank karj or rasookh ke sahare aise udyogon main utar jate hai jahaan na unka tajurba he, na jarurat
 Amrapali started making films by building houses and Anil Ambani group started financial services while taking up the work of repairing Rafael
 pashchim kii companiyaan lambey samay tak ek hi kaarobaar main rahakar niveshkon or upabhoktaaon ko behatar ritern va sevaayen detii hai jabaki bharat kii 80 fisad ‘great’ companiyaan puunji par ritern ganvaakar yaa karj main funs kar bahut kam samay main ausat str par aa jaati hai
 Why did governments start to worry about poor governance in companies? They mean tax or electoral funding from them
 pravartakon kaa kuch bhi daanv par hota hi nahin
 Employment and debt of banks are drowning
 marati he bazaar main pratispardhaa
 Obviously, this loss does not affect the health of any leader
 aksham sarkaar ko paanch saal main badla ja saktaa he, lekin aksham companiyon ke prabandhakon ko badalanaa asambhav hota he

 Pakistan's biggest deception, Pakistan's biggest ghost and Pakistan's most blood-wrenching tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan's Mullah Fazlullah alias Mulla Radio may have been killed
 shaayad isliye kyonki isse pehle bhi kai baar is chalaave ke maare jane kii khabar aa chuki he
 But according to Pakistani media reports, this time he has been literally killed
 drone hamale main maaraa gaya aatankiagar pakistani media par yakeen karen to pakistan kaa paanch karod kaa inami aatankwaadi or swat main taharik-e-taliban kaa sabase bada netaa moulana fajalullah somvaar raat ko afghanistan main hue ek drone hamale main apane ghar ke andar hi maaraa gaya
 According to the report, the attack was carried out only after getting sufficient information about his house and he was killed in that attack
 haalanki mullah kii maut kii khabaron ko lekar na to taharik-e-taliban kii taraf se koi pratikriya ai he or na hi pakistan sarkaar abhi isaki pushti kar rahi he
 Pakistani security officials say that there has been news about the death of tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan Chief Mullah Fazlullah on Monday night
 lekin abhi ham log uski maut se jude sabooton ko dhund rahe hai
 News of the death has come many times
 It is noteworthy that even before this, there have been reports of Taliban chief's death, but all those reports turned out to be false
 pichley saal march main khabar ai thi ki khaybar agency ke tirah ghati main hue hawaii hamalon main maare jane waalon main fajalullah bhi shaamil he
 But after that the TTP had called it a rumor and said that their Chief is still alive
 thik isi tarah june 2009 main bhi fajalullah ke maare jane kii khabar ai thi
 But according to the Pakistani media, Fazlullah could not survive this time
 or isaki vajah he peshawar ke bacha khan uniwarsity par taliban ke hamale ke baad paak sarkaar kaa sakht ravaiya
 Since the attack, the Pakistan Army and security agencies have intensified attacks against tehrik-e-taliban Pakistan
 paak kaa sabase khatarnaak aatanki tha mullah radiopakistan main aatank ke sabase khoonkhaar chehre kaa naam he fajalullah or iske ek ishaare par marane-maarane ko uthaaru ho jaataa he taliban
 This is the person who not only transformed Pakistan's swat valley called Switzerland into hell, but its nefarious plans have made Pakistan cry many times
 pakistan kii swat ghati
 Fazlullah made this area very beautiful, a stronghold of terror
 roj-roj apane nae fatvon se logon ke dilon main khauf kaa wo manjar paidaa kar diya ki fajallulaah ke naam se bhi wo kaanpane lage
 Here the fear and fear of Fazallulah was visible on everyone's face
 aurate ghar se burka daalkar nikalatin or bachche skool jane se darate
 Fazlullah created Radio Mullah, along with his father-in-law Sufi Muhammad, Fazlullah captured the rule of terror in the Swat Valley
 radio taliban par aae din apane fatvon se swat ghati main majahab ke naam par ghinauna khel khelaa
 Sometimes a fatwa for women to leave the house, sometimes a decree not to send children to school, sometimes a declaration of death sentence for listening to music
 har farmaan ke saath fajallulaah kaa cheharaa or bhi khatarnaak hota gaya
 Anyone who dared to ignore the decrees of Fazllulah received the death penalty
 to auraton ko mili saream kodon kii sajaa
 After which no one dared to raise his head in front of Fazallulah
 fazal hayaat tha paidaaishi namjis khooni giroh ne peshawar ke skool main maasoom bacchon kaa katleam kiya uskaa mukhiya tha moulana fajalulla urf mullah radio
 His birth name was Fazal Hayat
 1974 main pakistan ke swat jile main paidaa hua yah pashtun ugravadi devband sunni islam kaa samarthak tha or pakistan main sharia kanoon lagu karwaanaa chahta tha
 Fazlullah of a very radical ideology comes from the same community as the Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai
 fajalullah ko pakistan kii sarkaar ne 2005 main giraftaar kar liya tha
 He read all religious books while staying in jail
 vahaan se hi uske kattarwad kii shuruyaat hui
 After getting released from jail, he got an agreement between the government of Pakistan and the fundamentalists, in return for which the Pak government allowed him to implement Sharia law in Malakand district
 khadi kar lee thi fojaisi ke baad se mullah dhire-dhire swat ghati ke ilaake main majboot hota chalaa gaya
 He later joined hands with the dreaded terrorist Baitullah Mehsud
 2007 tak usne 4500 ladaakon kii fouj bana lee or swat ghati ke 59 gaanvon par apni hukumat chalaane laga
 On 10 July 2009, he was injured in the Pakistani army attack but escaped
 fouj ne karodon rupee kii laagat se bane uske madrase ko nestnabut kar diya
 It was only after the army's attack that he moved to Afghanistan and started operations from there
 afghanistan main rahakar hi wo pakistani phujon par hamale karata tha
 The Sharia Law was advocated: From the very beginning, there was a strong advocacy of Sharia law and severe punishment was given to those who broke it
 inamen galaa kaat kar maut kii sajaa dena tak shaamil tha
 He was a staunch opponent of music, TV, cinema, etc
 and punishes those who do so
 usne swat main computer kii tamaam dukaanon main aag lagava di thi
 Fazlullah was particularly against the training of Muslim women and their going to school
 usne ladakiyon ke das skulon ko bam se uda diya tha
 While about 170 schools were decimated
 mullah fajalullah ke hi kehane par 2012 main malala par hamalaa hua tha
 When Fazlullah's name was uttered, the police were afraid to leave the Pak Army until it turned to its stronghold, especially its headquarters
 ye vahihadquarter tha jahaan sefjalullah tamaamkhatarnaak sajishein rachataa
 This was the same place where Fazlullah captivated his prisoners and oppressed them
 ye vahi jagah thi jahambaith kar wo mullah radioke jarietamammout kefarmaan jari karata
 It was here that Maulana Fazlullah's Headquarter was no less than a fortress in the strength of Taliban
 yahaan wo sab kuch tha jo kisi satta ke centre main hona chahie
 Taliban commanders used to take orders from here and train them
 aakhri faisla bhi yaheen se sunaaya jaataa tha
 The Supreme Court of Taliban was run by the headquarters of Mullah Radio
 is court kaa faisla aakhri hota tha, or wo faisla sab par lagu tha
 Whether it is tribal people or Taliban fighter
 taliban kii sabase badi jail bhi yaheen thi
 Convicted prisoners were kept here
 kisi kaidi par kode barasaane hon yaa phir barbar sajaa deni ho is jail main saare bandobast the
 Many prisoners fell victim to the excesses of the Taliban
 kitne maare gaye iskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 The Taliban's bank was also in the same headquarters
 logon se vasule gaye paison kaa hisaab-kitaab yaheen rakhaa jaataa tha
 Who had to pay how much money, in which operation, how much money had to go, everything was decided here
 paison ke len-dein kaa faisla khud fajalullah hi karata tha
 The headquarters of the Swam River, the Imamaderi headquarters was built on the banks of the Swat River in 2004
 is par kareeb 1 karod rupye lage
 People gave these money as donation
 us vakt kaaphi soch-samaj kar swat nadi kaa ilaaka chunaa gaya tha
 This area was also very important from the point of view of security
 yahaan se dur-dur tak najar rakhi ja sakati thi
 It was also very important from the point of view of administration
 yahaan se puure swat ke oparation kaa kaman sambhala ja saktaa tha
 Fazlullah also chose this area in terms of security
 kyonki ye ilaaka chaaron ore se kabayaliyon se ghira he
 The Taliban had good penetration among the tribes, so it was more secure
 imamderi kaa ye headquarter fajalullah ke sasur sufi mohammad ko bhi kaaphi pasand tha
 In 2007 it was under the occupation of Sufi Mohammed
 baad main paak army se samjhaute ke baad sarkaar ne ise sufi ko hi saunp diya
 Sufi Mohammed then handed it over to his son-in-law Fazlullah
 safar ke dauraan baari-bharkam suutakes logon ko thakaa detaa ho, to is smart suutakes kaa istemaal karnaa acha opshan ho saktaa he
 There is no need to hold this suitcase, just at a gesture it will go along with you
 is anokhe suutakes kaa nirmaan isroyal ke enyue robotics vaigyanikon ne kiya he
 According to the NUA Robotics Institute, 'this suitcase has a camera, sensor and Bluetooth
 yah yugers ke smartphone se conect hokar uske nirdeshon kaa paalan bhi karata he
 Not only this, this suitcase is so smart that if an unknown person touches it, its alarm starts ringing
 iske alaava isamen khaas alarm kisi ke chhinane yaa chori karne kii sthiti main bhi jor-jor se bajane lagata he
 If you are traveling with this suitcase, then you will not have the problem of discharging your mobile or tablet, because USB socket is fitted in it
 iske jariye aaraam se gagetts charge kiye ja sakate hai
 The special thing is that all the technology fit in it only 1
 5 kilo kii hai jise yatri aasaani se uthaa sakate hai
 Currently, this suitcase can only run on the plane surface
 exparts kaa maananaa he ki ise sidhiyon or duusari jagah bhi chalane laayak banaaya janaa chahie
 The NUA Institute of Robotics says that research is still on, they are trying to make it even better by adding new features to it
 ummid he ki ek saal ke bheetar yah anokhaa suutakes logon ke bich pahunch jayega
 On behalf of the BJP, Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opposing the Communal Violence Bill and said that the proposed bill is a 'recipe for destruction'
 modi ne vidheyak ko rajyon ke adhikaar kshetra kaa atikaraman kaa prayaas kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki is sambandh main aage koi kadam uthaane se pehle is par rajya sarkaron, raajnneetik partiyon, police or suraksha agency jaise saajhedaaron se vyapak vichaar-vimarsh kiya janaa chahie
 On Modi's letter, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government is talking of moving ahead with consensus
 unhone kaha ki is bill par aam sahmati banane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Singh said that the government wants the cooperation of all sections of Parliament to ensure smooth passage of the bills
 gauratlab he ki modi kaa yah patr sansad ke sheet satr kii shuruyaat par subah main hi aayaa
 The Bill is expected to be discussed in the current session
 modi ne apane patr main aarope lagaaya, sampradayik hinsa vidheyak galat dhang se vichaarit, jaise taise taiyaar or tabaahi kaa nuskhaa he
 The BJP leader said, due to politics, and due to vote bank politics rather than genuine concern, the timing of bringing the bill is doubtful
 modi ne kaha ki prastaavit kanoon se log dharmik or bhashaai aadhaar par or bhi bant jaaenge
 He said, the proposed bill would strengthen religious and linguistic identity even more and minor incidents of violence would also be communally colored and thus what the bill seeks to achieve would have the opposite effect
 bhaajapa netaa ne prastaavit sampradayik hinsa unmoolan (nyaay evam pratipurti) vidheyak, 2013 ke 'kaary ke mudde' bhi buland kiye
 He said, for example, Article 3 (f) which defines 'ambiguous environment' is pervasive, vague and open to abuse
 modi ne kaha, isi tarah anuchhed 4 ke saath pathan vaale anuchhed 3 (di) ke tahat sampradayik hinsa kii paribhaasha yah sawaal khadey karegi ki kya centre bhartiya aapraadhik vidhishastra ke sandarbh main 'vichaar aparaadh' kii avadharana laai ja rahi he
 Venkaiah stressed the need for women empowerment and equal opportunities for women, saying, "we also call our country Bharat Mata or Mother India

 The Bahubali face of Harish Rawat, who is considered to be an expert player in politics, did not like the people of Uttarakhand
 natijatan unako haridwar gramin or kichha vidhansabha kshetron se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa

 soobe main congress ke behad lokapriy cheharaa maane jane vaale ravat chaar baar chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 He was also a Rajya Sabha member, but was always a victim of neglect from the party
 ravat ko purv mukhyamantri evam congress ke varisht netaa rahe endi tiwari kaa dhur virdohi mana jaataa he
 Due to Tiwari, he was kept away from the politics of the state for a long time, but he did not leave the Congress
 lihaaja ravat ko centre kii raajnneeti main tavajjo milti rahi
 When the Congress government was formed in the state, he was sidelined and Vijay Bahuguna was made the Chief Minister
 haalanki janata ke bich apni lokapriyata evam majboot paith ke chalate ravat kaa kad kam nahin or ek samay aisa bhi aayaa, jab vijay bahuguna ko mukhyamantri pad chhodana padaa or unki jagah ravat kii tajposhi kii gai
 After becoming the Chief Minister, the leaders of his own party went on a revolt against Rawat

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has come under the scanner of the bankers due to a statement given on the fourth anniversary of the Modi government
 khaas baat ye he ki nitish ne ye bayaan bankeron ke hi ek kaarykram main mukhya atithi ke rup main diya tha
 Now the bankers are targeting Nitish and Nitish is paying his price but the funny thing is that all this is happening in the virtual world
 matlab na dharna-pradarshan, na narebaaji or na hadtaal lekin siem ko virodh kii tapish jhelni pad rahi he
 What Nitish gave statement: Chief Minister Nitish had said in the 64th quarterly review meeting organized by the State Level Bankers' Committee in Patna, "banks will have to strengthen their mechanisms for the correct allocation of funds that the government provides for development in the country
 bank 'autonomas' he, upar se neeche tak in chizon ko dekhnaa hoga
 Nitish blamed the banks for the failure of demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki bainkon kii bhoomika ke kaaran notebandi kaa laabh jitna milanaa chahie tha, utana nahin mila
 Bankers took to Facebook, angry with Badlaneetish's statement, people launched a campaign against Nitish Kumar on social media, especially Facebook
 inamen zyaadaatar bankkarmi hi hai
 People working in different states and banks of the country have started reducing the rating of Nitish Kumar's official Facebook page
 pichley do din main 16 hajaar logon ne nitish kumaar ke fasebuk pej ko 1 reating di he
 As a result, the Bihar Chief Minister's Facebook page has a rating of 4
 8 se ghatakar 1 rah gai he
 What does a rating decrease mean aajtak
 inke tech export munzir ahamed ke mutabik kisi bhi fasebuk pej par reating kaa ek system hota he
 The page admin can either make it public or remove it
 agar ye public he to koi bhi fasebuk yujar pej ko reating de saktaa he
 It is a star rating and ranges from 1 to 4 stars
 pej kii star reating is baat par nirbhar karti he ki kitne yugers ne kitne star die hai
 For example, most users are giving 1 star to this page, so only one blue star will be seen here
 ise clic karne se aap un logon ko bhi dekh paaenge jinhone star reating di he or coment kiya he
 Bankers are also giving the reason for decreasing the rating
 It is not that the people who are rating the page are hiding this work
 wo aisa karne kii vajah bhi bataa rahe hai
 While doing so, most people are writing their comments as comments and checking the accounts of some of them reveals that a large number of those doing so are bank employees
 kaise-kaise coment kar rahe hai yujaraunion bank of india ke dipti branch head ranjit yadav ne nitish kumaar ke pej ko 1 reating di he wo likhte hai, 'mahoday
 
 
 Perhaps you have been told to "like many preaching but efficient"
 
 
 bankeron par koi tohamat lagane se pehle kabhi apana daaman bhi dekh liye hote'elahabaad bank main manager sunaina sharma bhi gusse main hai
 He wrote, 'mr
 Chief Minister get your information correct
 apni kharaab yojana kaa bhaar bankers par mat daaliye
 You should honor the hard work done by the bankers during the demonetisation

 Diesel has been affected by LPG inflation fire and now its heat has reached the Manmohan government
 mahangaai ke masale par manmohan mantrimandal main matbhed ubhar chukaa he
 Union Food Minister KV Thomas has expressed his displeasure by writing a letter to the PM
 thomas gas silendar se sabsidi hataane par khafa hai
 KV Thomas has written a letter to the Prime Minister suggesting that the price of the 7th to 12th cylinder be increased by only Rs
 50
 isi tarah unhone 13wein se choubeeswein silendar tak kii keemat 150 rupye se zyada naa badhaane kii baat kahi he
 And advocated the abolition of subsidy from the 24th cylinder in a year
 thomas ne apni chitthee main likhaa he ki aam janata mahangaai se trast he
 He has also expressed displeasure over the hike in diesel prices and suggested the government to make slabs for this
 aam janata kii phikr dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko bhi hui he
 Taking some ointment on the decision of the central government, the Delhi government has decided to give subsidy on 9 LPG cylinders instead of six to poor families
 isse dilli main kareeb saade teen lakh logon ko laabh milegaa
 Although Finance Minister p Chidambaram has clearly refused to reduce the prices, it is clear that there are people in the Congress and the Central Government who do not agree with this and the general public also feels in their heart

 Dear Congress Party workers, agle 24 ghante mahatvapurn hai
 Stay alert and alert
 dare nahin
 You are fighting for the truth
 farji agsit pole ke dushprachaar se niraash na ho
 Have faith in yourself and the Congress party, your hard work will not go in vain

 Rahul Gandhi, the exit poll has predicted the Congress not getting the seats as per its expectation, although experts believe that if the party crosses the 100 mark, it could be a bit comfortable for him and the president Rahul Gandhi
 
 vaise, pichley loksabhaa chunaav main arsh se farsh par pahunchane ke baad is baar siton kaa shatak lagaana congress ke liye nishchit taur par chunauteepurn lakshya he
 On the other hand, Rahul, who took charge of the party a year and a half ago, is also a test of leadership, however, the party believes that the Congress will do well under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 congress 2014 ke aam chunaav main 44 siton par simat gai thi
 It was the worst performance of the party so far
 chunaav purv or chunaav baad ke surveykshanon main congress kii siton main ijaphe kii baat kii ja rahi he, haalanki party ke aasaani se satta tak pahunchane kaa koi purvanumaan nahin he
 According to experts, the comfortable situation for the Congress would be that it reached the figure of 100, but if it does not, then Rahul Gandhi's leadership will also be questioned to some extent
 kuch maheenon se tej pratap apane parivaar se naaraaz chal rahe hai, kyonki unke parivaar ne unhen apni patni aishwarya raay se talaak nahin lene diya
 Even when he did not listen, he left home and stayed outside for a few weeks
 tej pratap kii patni aishwarya raay abhi bhi lalu parivaar ke saath rah rahi hai
 Worst of all, Tej Pratap's father-in-law Chandrika Rai is contesting from Saran, the seat of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu prasad yadav ne saal 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main saaran seat se jeet hasil kii thi
 This was the last election of Lalu Prasad Yadav, because after this he was convicted in the fodder scam, due to which his election was banned
 rabari devi shuruyaat main is seat se chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar ho gai thim, lekin swasthya ko dekhte hue shaayad unhone manaa kar diya
 Tej Pratap opposed this and threatened to resign from the student wing of the RJD to form a new party
 haalanki, unhone apni party kaa naam 'lalu-rabari morcha' tay kar liya
 But Tejashwi Yadav ignored his point and declared Chandrika Rai as the candidate
 tej pratap ne ab dhamkee di he ki agar chandrika raay se tikat waapas nahin liya jaataa he to vah saaran seat se chunaav ladenge
 Along with this, he wants tickets for those close to Shivhar and Jehanabad seats
 agar aisa nahin hota he tej pratap ne kathith taur par dhamkee di he ki vah apni nai party ke binar tale apane ummidavaar khadey karenge
 Sources said that Tej Pratap was most upset when not a single of his close was given a ticket
 haalanki, vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan vah apane kuch kareebi logon ko tikat dilaane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 But now his younger brother Tejashwi has the authority to take the decision and Tej Pratap has no role in promoting and distributing tickets
 paariwarik sutron ne bataaya ki tej pratap bade bete jarur hai, lekin lalu yadav or rabari devi donon kaa maananaa he ki tejasvi yadav ne khud ko sabit kiya he or raajnneetik uttaradhikari bane rahenge
 They also know that Tejapratap is under the influence of Sadhu Yadav, Rabri Devi's elder brother, who once had a lot of partying
 lekin baad main lalu yadav ne unhen party se nikaal diya tha
 Sources said that through Tej Pratap, Sadhu Yadav is trying to make a comeback
 is weekend salmaan khan ne big bos ke ghar ke sadasyon kii achche se khabar lee or bataaya ki unki baahar kis tarah kii chhavi ban rahi he
 While this created a stir in the house, it has affected the mutual relations of the family
 aman suyash, kishwar or prince ke saath baat karte najar aayega or baat karegaa ki koun kiske khilaaf gang bana rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Vikas will cry when he gets his wife's letter
 yah khat unhen janmdin ke gift ke taur par milegaa
 The next day starts with 'dil Bole Shik Dhum' and this will be the first time Rimi will be seen supporting everyone in the morning dance
 kishwar or prince ko baat karte dekha ja sakegaa ki kaiseroshelle or mandanouse samay niraash ho gai thim jab remi ko phinale kii tikat mil gai thi
 Kishwar would also say that Mandana had even started copying Rimi for the sake of voting
 roshelle yuvika se unhen phek kehane ke liye maafee maangegi
 There will be tension between Mandana and Prince over cleanliness
 mandana ke tanj se khafa hokar prince kishwar or yuvika ko apni said le aayega
 Prince would also appear to ignore talking to Mandana
 baad main ghar ke sabhi sadsy nomination prakriya main shaamil honge
 They have to nominate a member who has performed the worst in the luxury budget task
 'big bos'kii ghoshnaa hogi ki mandana or kith pehle se hi nominete he kyonki unki parformens ko sabase kharaab bataaya gaya he
 Kishwaramandanan, as captain, will be upset over not contributing to the work
 is bich mandana suyash, prince or kishwar ke bich kii gutbaji ko todane kii ichha jataayengi
 Today, with 'bigg Bossaba', the members of the house will also get to hear the prediction about their future
 lekin yah mauka unheen sadasyon ko milegaa jo nominete nahin hue hai
 In the spirit of the overthrow of 25 years of communist rule in Tripura, many people have taken to breaking the statues of Lenin
 kai dakshinpanthi netaa to ise vaazib tehraate hue iske liye tark bhi gadhane lage hai
 But such people may be surprised to know that for them, the man of Hinduism, Veer Savarkar himself, met Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the communist revolution, in London
 samyawad ke andh virdohi bijepi-aresas ke kaaryakartaaon or samarthakon ko yah jaanakar bhi hairaani hogi ki hindu hriday samraat kahe jane vaale vinayak damodar saavarkar lenin ke prashansak the or aksar roosi netaaon dwaara likhe jane vaale parchon ko padhate the
 Everybody knows that Savarkar did not like Mahatma Gandhi's ideology
 unhone mahatma gandhi kii ahimsak swatantraaa sangram ke vichaar kaa virodh kiya tha
 In this case Savarkar considered revolutionaries like Lenin to be more practical
 beesvin sadi main desh se baahar swatantraaa sangram kaa ek pramukh centre landan kaa india house tha
 The revolutionary Shyamji Krishna Varma bought a house in London in 1905, which was later converted into India House as a hostel for Indian students
 iske udghaatan samaaroh main swatantraaa sangram ke hamaare pramukh nayakon main se dadabhai nauroji, lala lajpat raay or madam bhikaaji kama gai thim
 During the British rule, it became the main center of the independence movement of India
 saal 1906 main vir saavarkar kanoon kii padhai ke liye landan gaye the
 He studied in India House for three years
 ve ek prakhar vaktaa the jisaki vajah se jaldi hi landan main rahane vaale bharatiyon ke bich kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 India House often had revolutionary leaders from other countries like Russia, Ireland, Turkey, Egypt, Iran and China
 saavarkar ke ek british mitra the ji
 Alfred who had contact with Lenin, the hero of the Russian Revolution
 lenin kii khyaati un dinon rus se lekar europe tak pahunch gai thi
 According to the website based on the life of Veer Savarkar himself, Alfred took Lenin to India House in 1909 to meet Veer Savarkar
 bataaya jaataa he ki lenin chaar baar india house gaye the
 Savarkar was heavily influenced by Lenin
 It is not known what happened during the two's meeting, but it is said that Savarkar was greatly influenced by Lenin's thoughts after these meetings
 unhone jaar ke shashan vaale rus main badlaav laane ke lenin ke tareeke kii saraahna kii
 Later Savarkar became the inspiration of Jana Sangh, BJP and all right wing organizations
 sahitya ajtak ke duusare din kii shuruyaat chhath geet se huibijepi netaa manoj tiwari ne manch se gaae kai bhojpuri gitsahitya kaa sabase bada mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019' shuukravaar (1 november) se shuru ho gaya he
 Today is the second day of the program
 duusare din 'sahitya ajtak' ke 'hallaa bol' manch par 'sahitya kaa yangistan' seshan main teen yuva lekhakon vijayshri tanwir, divya prakaash dube or satya vyas ne apni raay rakhi
 The session was conducted by Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Saeed Ansari
 is charchaa ke dauraan teenon atithiyon ne apni baaten bebaaki se rakhin
 Starting the discussion, Saeed said that the question to all three of our guests is whether the youth of today need a separate literature
 vijayshri tanwir ne charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki pehle kya tha ki lekhak hi rachanaaen likhte the or lekhak hi padhate the kavi hi kavitaayen likhte the or kavi hi padhate the abhi yuvaaon ne lekhakon se alag ek nayaa pathak varg taiyaar kiya he
 He is a large readership, he is not even a writer, he is a common reader
 jo sirf jude hue hai
 Doing our entertainment abhi kuch samay se hindi bahut upekshit ho gai thi

 But the elder people did not accept him

 divya prakaash dube ne kaha bhashaa kii shuddhta bahut badi cheez he
 There is a misconception that our grandfathers used to speak very pure Hindi but it is not so
 jo log instagram par story bana rahe hote hai wo waisi bhashaa to nahin bolenge
 So, we tried to write in the language that we speak on tea
 1948 main abe-tabe kii bhashaa kaa istemaalsaty vyas ne charchaa ko aage badhaate hue kaha kedarnath gupt ne 1948 main abe-tabe kii bhashaa kaa istemaal apni kitaab main kiya tha
 Bhagwati Charan Varma's book is three years and if you look at it, there are small abuses
 jiske liye hamen kaha jaataa he ki ham bhashaa ko dooshit kar rahe hai
 It is just that we came at a time when our Hindi also got social media support
 hamane kuch nayaa shuru nahin kiya
 We just got more focus
 usamen hamaari marketing stritji bhi kaam kii rahi
 The language that was ours reached the people and people liked our writing
 aaj star har jagah laga hua henupama ganguli kaa chauthaa pyaar par baat karte hue vijayshri tanwir ne kaha yah ek kahani sangrah he or usamen zyaadaatar kahaniyaan extramarital afares par kendrit hai
 But i did not write thinking like that
 chauthaa pyaar ke bare main main kahati hum ki kya hamaare bhi kai afares nahin ho gaye hai
 We sometimes lean towards people
 jo aam jivan main hota he vahi maine likhaa he
 Divya Prakash Dubey, while talking about his book Condition Applied, said that i had approached the matter which is said slowly in the society
 aaj star har jagah laga hua he
 In my first book, there was a lot of glorious Galasitya Prakash saying that i feel that there is a lot of possibility of mistakes in the way i write because i give myself a lot of freedom while writing
 meri pehali kitaab ai to maine usamen bharmaar gaali thi
 But she was on the background of Banaras and there is no talk without abuses
 duusari kitaab maine dilli darbar par likhi jab maine use prakaashak ke paas bheja to usne kaha isamen ek kairactor rahul mishra ke 7 afaire hai, aisa hota nahin aam jindagi main
 i told him that i am new, you have to print my second book, you make 4 affairs but Rahul Mishra had 7 affairs
 content hi kitaab ko aage badhayegavijayshri ne bhashaa kii shuddhta par baat karte hue aage kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki bhashaa ko hamen vikrut nahin karnaa chahie
 You write, where you need to write, you will have to create an atmosphere, but you should not force it
 jabaran gaali bhar kar kitaab ko mashhoor nahin karnaa chahie
 There should be no effort to spice it up
 satya prakaash ne charchaa main aage hissaa lete hue kaha ki hamaare guruon ne kabhi bhi controvarsi ke jariye lokapriy hone kii salaah nahin di
 He always said that your content should have power
 controvarsi or marketing stritji se ek-do din hi baat hogi
 The content itself will carry the book forward
 jo bhashaa sab bolte hai vahi hamane likhadivya prakaash dube ne is bare main apni raay rakhte hue kaha ki manohar shyaam joshi kii van line thot he ki hindi main peeth thukvaane ke liye bahut pair dabaane padate hai
 All of us new people never took this load, that's why no bags were taken on us
 ham kisi hindi kii steblisd megsine main nahin chape the
 No one has taken that approach to the standard process of becoming a writer
 hamaare jo tareeke the hamane usee ko istemaal karke likhaa
 We wrote in the same manner with honesty on the language everyone spoke
 kapol koun bolta he abhi
 Right now, the public is aware, Vijayjay said that there is a conscious public, we all know what is happening in the society and what is not happening
 lekhak ke taur par hamaari saamaajik jimmedaari jarur banati he ki main kya massej de rahi hum, main ashleelata nahin failaa rahi hum
 i am not saying that you make 8 affairs, i just showed that it is happening, i did not support it at all
 maine yah nahin kaha ki yahi hona chahie, sawaal chode hai
 We were very encouraged by people
 Satya Prakash said that i never felt that i had come with any threat or that i had done something different or i was about to separate
 divya prakaash ne kaha ki ham saare log jo nai brid vaale aage aae to hamaara anubhav acha rahaa
 i always felt that people encouraged us a lot
 puraane logon ne bahut protsaahit kiya
 Some tussle people are everywhere
 hamaare raste main politics ai hi nahin
 We did not know how the book was published
 hamaari kitaaben bikin aise ki ek ghar main logon ne 10-10 logon ko kitaaben padhwaain
 No mandar can give you such an audience

 Gutvadita is everywhere, Vijayjay said that Gutvadita is everywhere
 nae log jab aate hai to logon ko lagata he ki ye kya likh paaegaa, prakaashak bhi nahin jaanata kyonki ham kahin chape nahin hote hai
 We do not fall under the natural process of print writers
 isliye prakaashak paise maangate hai
 i did not struggle at all, i called the publisher and he said that he sent some content to my editor
 uske teen din baad unka kol aayaa ki ham sabase paise lekar unako nahin chhapate hai
 We will not take money from the content in which we think we will find it on the bench
 ghoda agar ghaas se yaari karegaa to kya khayega
 Money is also required to run a publication
 prakaashak kii apni majaburi hoti haisaty prakaash ne bhi kaha ki unase kabhi publisher kii taraf se paise kii maang nahin hui
 But the publisher also has his own helplessness
 uske paas ek maheene main 150 pandelpiyaan aati hai
 There are times that he likes 5-10 Pandalupis
 usamen vah apana paisa lagaataa he baaki logon ko vah bol detaa he ki inako ham nahin chhap sakate yaa is kitaab ko ham saajha puunji se chhaapenge
 To say if you want to print a book, we will give half the money, we will put half
 iske baad us 140 pandelpiyon main se 70 taiyaar ho jate hai or 70 kehete hai ki hamase paise maange gaye
 For 70 people who invest money and get a book printed, it is called Chhap Rog
 saal main 100-200 kitaaben aati hai
 It is up to the writer that when the publisher refuses to print the content, then you obey it and work hard in your work
 sahitya ajtak 2019 main shaamil le rahe atithiyon kii list dekhne ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 
 divya prakaash ne kaha ki ab sthiti badal gai he ab to ham pehle paise maangate hai phir kitaab chhapane ke liye dete hai
 People feel that if my book gets published, i will join a different category
 samaaj main dabadabaa ho jayega
 People do not want to work hard, when we send a book, it gets rejected many times and we re-write it
 'baagi baliya' kaa locarpaipani nai kitaab baagi baliya ke bare main bataate hue satya vyas ne kaha ki yah meri chauthi kitaab he or yah hindu-muslim sauhaard par aadhaarit he

 hai court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki yah baat sabit nahin hoti ki chinkaare ko salmaan ne apni licency gan se hi maaraa tha
 The comments darasal hai court main puri sunwaayee ke dauraan ekmaatr chashmadid gavaah harish dulani ke gaayab rahane kaa maamla prakaash main aayaa
 The case was weakened due to his absence and the verdict went in favor of Salman Khan
 gauratlab he ki kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa ek teesraa maamla abhi rajasthan main vichaaradhin he
 In 2006, Salman Khan was sentenced to five years by the trial court in the Chinkara case
 unhone ek saptaah jodhpur kii jail main bhi bitaye the or uske baad unako jamaanat mil gai thi
 In fact, during the entire hearing in the High Court, the case of the lone eye witness Harish Dulani's disappearance came to light
 uski gavaahi nahin hone ke kaaran cese kamjor ho gaya or faisla salmaan khan ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 Significantly, a third case of black deer hunting is still under consideration in Rajasthan
 2006 main salmaan khan ko chinkaara maamle main nichali adaalat ne paanch saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 He also spent a week in Jodhpur jail and was granted bail after that

 congress ke rajkumaar rahul gandhi apane bhaashanon ke liye kabhi nahin jane jate the lekin is baar unhen ek behtareen mauka mila jise unhone jaaya kar diya
 In front of his select workers, he spoke many things and many achievements, including RTI
 naregaa, aadhaar, panchayat raaj vagairah kii unhone charchaa kii
 Playing the election bugle, he addressed his cadres loudly and tried to excite them
 lekin badi safai se piem candidet banane kii kaaryakartaaon kii maang ko taal gaye
 He spoke on democracy, talked about the party and called it a thought
 unhone kuch lok lubhaavni baaten bhi kahin masalan rasoi gas ke silinderon kii sankhya badhaakar salanaa 12 karne kaa suzav
 He also said to please the workers that by asking them, the candidates will be decided i
e
 a beginning of internal democracy in the party
 rahul yuva hai or isliye apane bhaashan main unhone yuva varg ko puraa dhyaan main rakhaa
 Rahul Gandhi discussed the marketing of the opposition but the question is who is stopping him from his marketing
 jitani uplabdhiyon kii vah baaten kar rahe hai un par to acchhee khaasi marketing ho sakati he
 How can he criticize the opposition on this matter? He recalled the old leaders in terms of telling the truth
 unki photo dikhaai lekin yah baat samakaleen netaaon ke bare main kyon nahin kahi? bhrashtachar ke bade-bade aaropon par vah chup kyon rahe? party chunaav main kis moto se ladegi or uskaa naaraa kya hoga, is par vah kuch nahin bole
 This means that they ignore whatever issues are relevant today
 yah bhaashan unke jivan kaa sarvshereshth to katai nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 We will probably have to wait longer and those who write their speeches will also have to work harder
 rahul gandhi ke bhaashan kii shuruyaat main jo josh tha vah aage nahin dikhaa or na hi unamem vah aakraamak andaaj dikhaai diya jo yuddh main sainikon kaa netritv karne vaale captain main dikhataa he
 It did not look like a soldier who was going to take part in a cross-border battle
 jujhaaru sainikon ke tevar hi alag hote hai or vah tevar yahaan nahin dikhaa
 Just looking, a mother's glowing face and her motherly eyes
