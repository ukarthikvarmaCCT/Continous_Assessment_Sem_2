 The last time the BJP got 37 out of 81 seats in Jharkhand, for the sake of consensus, the BJP broke 6 mlas of Jhavimo
 The election results of Thahariyana have brought the BJP in 'alert mode' in Jharkhand
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main mukhya vipakshi dal jharkhand vikaas morch (jhavimo) ke 6 vidhayakon ko todakar kisi tarah sarkaar banane main safal rahi bhaajapa is baar kisi bhi haal main bahumat ke aankade ko choona chaahati he
 The BJP has kept Om Mathur, the national vice-president and the state assembly election in-charge, since August
 jharkhand main is saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi 14 main se 12 siten rajg ko milin, magar party vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar kisi tarah ke mugalate main nahin he
 The party believes that even after sweeping all the 10 Lok Sabha seats of Haryana, when it could not get a majority in the assembly elections, then it is not right to be 'over confident' about Jharkhand
 bhaajapa main chunaav prabandhan se jude ek netaa ne ieenes se kaha, 'bhaajapa is maamle main khushnaseeb he ki use koi na koi chunaav nateeja aage ke liye, samay rahete red alert kar detaa he, jisase aage kii ranneetik chukon ko dur karne main madad milti he
 Looking at the Haryana election results, the party is working on a 'fullproof plan'
 ise dharaatal par utaarne ke liye sanghathan ke aise manze hue netaaon kii team utaari jaaegi, jinhen jharkhand ke mizaaj kii baarik samaj hogi
 'actually, bjp's concern about Jharkhand is because last time only 37 out of 81 seats were won
 tab bahumat ke liye bhaajapa ko mukhya vipakshi dal jhavimo ke 6 vidhayakon ko todna padaa tha
 After this, BJP had 43 mlas as against 41 required for majority
 rajyapal ne do tihaai se adhik vidhayakon ke bhaajapa main aane ke kaaran unke vilay ko manjuuri di thi
 Party sources say that if like 2014 the bjp's car again stands away from the majority then it will be forced to do manipulative politics like last time, in such a situation the party will try to bring a majority by throwing full force in this time assembly elections
 Is in sutara bataate hai ki jharkhand main pehali baar banaae gaye gaiyr adivasee mukhyamantri raghubar das se kaha gaya he ki vah kisi bhi keemat par asantusht netaaon ko manaakar ekajute rakhen
 Prevent conflict within the election in every possible way
 party haryana kii tarah jharkhand main tikat vitaran main kisi tarah kaa risk nahin lenaa chaahati
 In the manner in which many leaders, who were angry with the ticket being cut in Haryana, won the election as a rebel, BJP does not want to take the risk of upsetting the leaders having mass base in Jharkhand
 chaatro ko shiksha ke mandir main die jane vaale mid-de-mile' kaa chhipakali, keede or fafoond se anany sambandh rahaa he
 Many times the dalit children have been separated apart from the brotherhood
 ab vahi 'mid-de-mile' garibon ke liye jaanaleva ho chalaa he
 The government machinery has started talking about improving the accountability of the murder
 chhapra or madhubani jile kaa jaharila 'mid-de-mile' is tathy ko bataa rahaa he ki sarkari lungar kaa abhishaap, garibon ko nigal rahaa he
 Today there is a mid-day meal in the name of studies in primary schools
 blike board par ganit, vigyaan ke sawaal nahin, khaane kaa minu likhane kaa aadesh he
 There is a clever mindset behind ruining primary education on the pretext of 'mid-day-meal'
 nijee skulon kii lahalhati fasal, jinamein paise waalon ke ladke pard-likhakar apana bhavishya sanvaar rahe hai, unke viruddh vidroh na ho, iske liye jaruri he wajipha or khichdi khilaanaa
 After all, the poor people should feel that the government is worried about them
 chaalaak log jaanate hai ki garibon ko raashtra kii mukhyadhara se baahar karne ke liye jaruri he, unhen shiksha se kaat dena
 All this is being done on the pretext of mid-day-meal
 garib hitaishi dikhne ke liye bacchon ko taai, belt, poshaak or kitaab muft main diya ja rahaa he
 All the ngos are earning millions in the name of 'school Chalo Abhiyan'
 kaha ja rahaa he ki shiksha par kul bajet kaa 4 fisadi kharch kiya ja rahaa he
 But in most primary schools, there is only one teacher who is busy in calculating the 'mid-day meal', to get the school building done
 inke alaava janaganana, pulse polio, chunaav jaise kaam bhi hai
 The truth is that the poor are not being educated in their country, they have been caught with the inclination to bring a bowl and eat 'mid-day-meal'
 unhen kakehara se aage padhgaye kii jarurat nahin
 Take a stipend, eat food, read without a teacher, pass and become a NREGA laborer
 assi-nabbe ke dashak tak ganwai skulon se padhe tamaam ladke shashan-prashasan kii dhuree ban jate the
 Due to this, such a policy of imparting education was adopted that the matter should be reversed
 garibon kii himachati sarkarein dohari shiksha niti par prahaar kyon nahin karatin? samaan nagarikon ko samaan shiksha paane kaa haq kyon nahin diya jaataa? gunatmak shiksha se garibon ko vanchit kar pratiyogita parikshaon se alag karne kii chaal he
 15 of the country
 67 fisadi praathmik skulon main ek yaa ek bhi shikshak nahin he
 This is a matter of consideration, when there are no teachers in schools, will children be taught by feeding them? The parents of malnourished children can be fed their hunger directly by providing ration and poisonous 'mid-day-meal' and untouchability Children can be saved from frustration
 shahari maanen parents-de par apane bachche kii progress jaanane jaati hai jabaki gaanv kii maanon ko kaha jaataa he ki, ''baari-baari aaen, jaanchen, parakhen tabhi khilaaen
 “that is, the poor are being given the right to eat, not just to study
 kul milakar 'mid-de-mile' ke bahaane garibon ke bacchon ko shaikshik taur se apahiz banaakar upar badaae se rokane kaa ek kuchakr he?(lekhak kahanikar hai

 tippaniyan Eden Gardens has been a lucky ground for Mumbai, having won five of their six matches, a figure that will definitely boost Rohit Sharma's team morale
 dilachasp he ki rohit 2009 main deccan chargers kii khitaabi jeet kaa hissaa the or mumbai ke captain ke liye yah doosraa ipel final hoga
 The only problem they have to overcome is the tendency to score short runs in between
 rohit ke liye bataur ballebaaj yah acha maheenaa nahin rahaa he, unhone apana antim ardhashatak (naabad 79) 29 april ko kings ilevan punjab ke khilaaf lagaaya
 The Chennai team consists of 'orange Capdhari' Michael Hussey, who has scored 732 runs
 vah is match main bhi dhoni ke bharosemand suresh raina ke saath yogadan karnaa chahenge, jinhone naabad 100 ran samet 548 ran jode hai
 The arrest on suspicion of betting of Gurunath Meiyappan, associated with the Chennai team management, would surely have dampened the morale of the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team
 mayyppan team ke maalik or bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ke damaad hai
 It will be a tough challenge for the players and their captain to overcome this condition and show their natural game against the team which is desperate to win the first trophy of the IPL
 chennai lagaataar chaar or kul milakar paanch baar final main pahunch chuki he, lekin mumbai ke liye khitaab jeetne or 2010 ke final main mili haar kaa badla chuktaa karne kaa yah sarvshereshth mauka hoga
 The Mumbai team would like to present this trophy to their senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar
 2010 main vah mumbai indians ke captain the or team final main dhoni kii team se 22 ran se haar gai thi, jisase vah kaaphi dukhi ho gaye the
 This was Chennai Super Kings' first IPL title, since then Dhoni's team status has only grown
 kaagaj par yah dwandv barabari kaa hoga, kyonki chennai or mumbai donon main twanti-20 ke aakraamak visheshgy maaikel hasi, dwen smith, rabindra jadeja or kerron pollard jaise diggaj shaamil hai
 The fast bowling attack of both teams is also quite sharp
 chennai ke paas elbi morkal or satr kii khoj mohit sharma shaamil hai, jabaki mumbai ke liye mishael johnson, lasith malinga or pollard kii tikdi shandaar pradarshan kar rahi he
 In a situation where the spin bowler can be the decider, Chennai has star bowlers in the form of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja
 mumbai kii team bhi apane anbhavi harbhajan singh or pragyan ojha ke rup main isaki barabari kar sakati he
 Harbhajan, who returned to form after taking three wickets for 23 runs against Rajasthan Royals on Friday night, was adjudged Man of the Match
 ummid he ki vah mumbai ke liye acha karenge, bhale hi team ko ojha kii chot kii chintaa kaa saamana karnaa pade, jo apni kohni chotil kara baithe the
 The comments eden gardens mumbai ke liye bhaagyashaalee maidan rahaa he, jisamen usne chah main se paanch match apane naam kiye hai, yah aankada nishchit rup se rohit sharma kii team kaa manobal badhayega
 Interestingly, Rohit was part of the Deccan Chargers' title win in 2009 and this will be the second IPL final for the Mumbai captain
 unhen sirf ek hi samasya bich main kam ran banane kii pravriti ko dur karnaa hoga
 It has not been a good month for Rohit as a batsman, he made his final half-century (79 not out) against Kings XI Punjab on 29 April
 chennai kii team main 'orange capadhari' maaikel hasi shaamil hai, jinhone 732 ran banaae hai

 jammu-kashmir ko bharat kaa abhinn ang bataate hue manmohan singh ne kaha ki bharat kii akhandta se samjhauta hamen katai manjuur nahin he
 He said that India wants to resolve problems with Pakistan through dialogue and Kashmir problem should be resolved under the Simla Agreement
 pradhanmantri pakistan ko kadaa sandesh dete hue kaha ki vah apane yahaan maujuud ‘aatanki mashinari’ ko band kare
 In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Manmohan Singh almost rejected Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's demand that the Kashmir issue be resolved under the UN Security Council resolution and said that India wants all issues resolved under the Simla Agreement is
 sharif ne shuukravaar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kashmir kaa mudda uthaate hue ise sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad prastaavon ke anuroop hal karne kii baat kahi thi

 Expressing a desire to resolve issues including Jammu and Kashmir through bilateral talks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, "however, for progress in this regard, it is necessary that the use of Pakistani land and areas under its control against India Don't be there to promote terrorism
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yah bhi samaan rup se mahatvapurn he ki pakistan se shah paa rahi aatanki mashinari ko band kiya jaae
 It should be clearly understood that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and there can never be any compromise with the unity and territorial integrity of India
 ’ pradhanmantri singh pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke saath ravivaar ko aamane saamne kii baithak karenge
 This is the first meeting of the two after Sharif became Prime Minister in June

 Tulsiram belonged to Azamgarh
 unka janm 1 july, 1949 ko hua tha
 Being born into a Dalit community, his childhood was spent in social and economic difficulties along with battling with perceived beliefs and shackles
 garibi or abhaav unki zidagin main saaye kii tarah rahaa, lekin aarambhik jivan main unhen jo aarthik, saamaajik or maansik pidaa jhelni padi, usne unhen lekhak bana diya
 There has been a vocal expression of that era in his literature
 bachapan se kitabon ke shaukeen dow
 Tulsiram got much strength and courage from Marxism
 banaras aane ke baad vah kuch lekhakon se jud gaye or dow
 Deeply studied the works of Bhimrao Ambedkar
 isse unki rachana-drushti main buniyadi parivartan hua
 After finishing his studies from Banaras Hindu University, he moved to Delhi and started teaching at Jawaharlal Nehru University and later became a professor
 dow
 Tulsiram in his writing openly expressed the sufferings, tortures, neglect, torture etc
 of Dalit life and attacked the social bonds fiercely
 unke achetan par mahatma buddha kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha, jiskaa udhaaharan unki aatmakatha 'murdahia' or 'manikarnika' main dikhataa he
 Songs and poems by dr
 tulsiram ke jivan kaa abhinn ang rahe, isiilie unke 'murdahia' or 'manikarnika' donon kii hi lekhan style main in donon ke bahaav dikhte hai
 His autobiography, which is divided into two volumes, 'murdahiya' and 'manikarnika', is a living treasure of the life conditions of the Dalits of eastern Uttar Pradesh and the enthusiasts of the Left movement in the region in the sixties and seventies
 apni is aatmakatha main babasahab bhimrao ambedkar ke saamaajik aatm ko profesar tulsiram ne apni smritiyon kaa sahare apane aatm se jod kar prastut karne kii koshish kii he
 "in the role of 'murdahiya' book, he wrote - 'murdahiya' was a multipurpose work place in our village Dharampur (azamgarh)
" charvaahee se lekar harvaahee tak ke saare raste vahiin se guzarate the
 Not only that, school or shop, market or temple, even if you had to hold a Calcutta train for wages, one had to go through Murdahiya itself
 "hamaare gaanv kii ‘jio-politics’ yani ‘bhu-raajnneeti’ main daliton ke liye murdahia ek samrik kendra jaisi thi
 Murdahiya used to cover all activities from life to death
 sabase rochak tathy yah he ki murdahia maanav or pashu main koi fark nahin karti thi
 She was the liberator of both
 vishesh rup se mare hue pashuon ke mansapind par jujhate saikadon gidhon ke saath kute or siyaar murdahia ko ek kala-sthali ke rup main badal dete the
 At night, the 'huan-huan' sound of these jackals used to dissolve his desolation
 hamaari dalit basti ke anginat dalit hajaaron dukh-dard apane andar liye murdahia main dafan ho gaye the
 If any of them had autobiography written, the title would have been 'murdahiya'
 "murdahia sahi myanon main hamaari dalit basti kii jindagi thi
 Whatever may be the time, whenever someone like me is born, he becomes a part of the public life revolving around him
 yahi kaaran tha ki lokajeevan hameshaa meraa peechha karata rahaa
 As a result when the first segment of 'murdahiya' ends after i run away from my house, Jogibaba singing rhymes with the first word coming out of the mouth of everyone in the village, Natinia scattering the chuckling sound, vulture-loving Paggal Baba and Singha Live folk characters like Bajata Bankia Dome make me very sad to disappear forever
 "prastut he dow
 An excerpt from his autobiography 'murdahiya' on Tulsiram's birth anniversary: one of my housemates was a buffalo buffalo, who used to come to me speaking bastard and started licking me
 uskaa mujhase behad lagaav tha
 i had a strange habit
 murdahia par jab bhi charaane jaataa, main uski peeth par ek ghudsavaar kii tarah baith jaataa
 He has no objection in any way
 main uski peeth par baitha rahata tathaa vah gumti-phirti charati rahati thi
 Meanwhile, one day Chikhuri of the village dug in a buffalo's udder with wood
 bhens bidakkar badi teji se uchhal padi
 i have no idea how i fainted for a while on the ground near a bush? There was a tomb adjacent to the bush
 hosh aane par mere hosh ud gaye
 Trembled in fear of ghosts
 yah khabar basti main fail gai
 Everyone said that buffalo roam on buffalo but they do not see
 log mere bare main kehete ki iske chadhane se ve naaraaz ho gaye, isiilie ise uthaakar jameen par patake diya
 Naggar Chacha rained on me in his familiar style
 meri yah samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki main chikhuri ko bhoot samajhun yaa ki jo murdahia main dafan the unako? chaahe jo bhi ho, is ghatana ke baad maine kabhi bhens par baithkar murdahia ke bhuton ko gussa nahin dilaayaa
 Kisuni Bhauji was deeply hurt by this accident
 ek din apane ghar bulaakar mujhe samajhaayaa ki 'he babu i sab ‘hawa-bataas' se bachi ke rahiha
 He got angry and killed him
 'hamaare kshetra main bhoot pishaach ko dalit ‘hawa-bataas' bhi kehete the
 This is the name of Kisani Bhauji's father-in-law, 'zaidi' who lived separately from his son
 jedi chachaa apni javaani ke dinon main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan usee bansu pandey ke khandaan kii harvaahee karte the
 One day during World War, they were plowing
 vahiin khet se hi ve gaayab ho gaye
 The villagers used to say that the British kidnapped a lot of laborers and took them to war
 yah to safataur par maaloom nahin ki jaidi kaise gaayab ho gaye ve swayan kisi ko asli baat nahin bataate
 Years later, when the Second World War ended, they had returned to the village
 unki vaapasi se gaanv vaale bahut khush the
 He was totally illiterate but used to talk that he seemed to be a professor of international politics
 jaidi chachaa ek chitra style main 'charachelva' kaa zikr karte the or use bahadur bataate the
 They also used to speak the word 'big Dail' in the name of many weapons, like 'sabari' fatter palan, dumdum, tonk, banethi, bomb etc
 kuch shabd aise bhi bolte the, jaise-masapotum, satal, basra, baghdad, dubai, chummaa, dajala aadi-aadi
 He used to say many such words freely without any sentence as if scolding someone
 ham sabko us samay kuch bhi samaj main nahin aata tha ki ve kya bol rahe hai
 Years later, when i was in higher education at the Banaras Hindu University, i could understand that Zaidi Chacha Churchill was given the Churchlava, Sab Marin was submarine, Fighter Plain was fatter Palen, Dumdum Bullet got Dum Dum, Tank got Tank, Banet was made, Mesopotamia was Maspotam, century Al Arab were called sattal, Ras al Khaimah was called khamma etc
 hakeekat yah ki jedi chachaa ko angrej vishwayuddh ke dauraan ek asthaayee tahalva ke rup main baghdad le gaye the
 Later, they came back to the village
 vaastaviktaa yah thi ki jaidi chachaa kaa mul naam 'lurkhur' tha
 But upon reaching Baghdad, an English officer started calling him as 'zaidi', a popular nickname for Shia Muslims
 vahaan yahi unka prachlit naam tha
 But the lurking uncle started thinking of himself as 'zaidi'
 gaanv main bhi log ‘jaidi' ke rup main hi unhen pukaarane lage the
 He used to tell many stories of World War, which i used to get very fascinated by listening to
 unki yah kahaniyaan mujhe lalachaa-lalachaakar maarthi thi
 After listening to them, i had a strong desire that i too should study before the fifth and know about the whole world
 kintu padhai chhootane kii nirantar duvidha evam chintaa ne mujhe ekadam manahuus bana diya tha
 a strange accident occurred during this experiment
 jaidi chachaa vahiin bansu pandey ke yahaan phir se harvaahee karne lage the
 They often quarreled because of the demand for proper bani
 unke is swabhaav ke kaaran bansu ne bakrii chori ke aarope main sabak sikhaane ke liye chiraiyakot thane ke ek brahman sipaahi, jisase unki dosti thi, ko bulaakar jaidi chachaa ko bahut pitwaya or dori main baandhakar thane le jane kii taiyaari karne lage
 The bizarre fact was that Bansu did not have any goat at all
 kisi tarah jaidi chachaa paanch rupaya ghoose dekar police se chhutkaaraa paae
 All this time we were also scared of the police
 bansu pandey ke is chaliya kapat se aghaatit hokar jaidi chachaa pratirodh swaroop ek nae kism kaa satyagrah karne lage
 They all stopped working and started growing beard and mustache and slept throughout the day by putting a bed in the sunlight to cover a bed
 poochne par kehete the ki jab tak babhan nyaay nahin karte, main dadhi moonch badhaata rahoonga tathaa dhoop main hi sounga
 He was very stubborn in this matter
 panchayat aadi dwaara kisi anya samjhaute ko ve maanane se saaf inkaar kar die the
 Gradually he started falling ill
 antatogatva usee akaal main ve praan tyaag die
 There was a very mournful atmosphere from his death
 jaidi chachaa gurmukh the
 They were supposed to follow the Shiva Narayana cult
 jab-jab hamaare ghar gaadi lagati thi, jaidi chachaa santauva gayaki main maahir the
 He had a loud voice
 jab santoba dhol-majire ke saath apni charam seemaa par hota tha, to jaidi chachaa achaanak khadey hokar bahut jor se daantne kii style main 'hvai' bol padate the
 This powerful 'hwa' made Tauba's attraction very interesting
 aise avasaron par main intjaar karata rahata tha ki kab jaidi chachaa 'hvai' kahkar daantate hai?jab unki laash dafnane ke liye murdahia par le jaai ja rahi thi, to shivnarayan panth kii parampara ke anusaar santauva ke dauraan kai logon ne unki is daantne vaali style kaa anusaran karnaa chaha, kintu wo baat kahaan jo jaidi chachaa main thi
 i also followed the corpse after his corpse
 unke dafan ke saath hi vahaan ke bhuton kii aabaadi main ek or naam jud gaya
 While returning from his grave, his words in my mind - Charachelwa, Maspotam, Fatter, Dumdum, Khamma, Tigris etc
 kept making noise
 aaj jab main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke ek bade centre kaa professor evam adhyaksh ban chukaa hum, to yah swikaarne main garv hota he ki iske peeche meri prerana ke asli janak ve teen garib majdoor the, jinhone mujhe choti umr main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii taraf anjaane main hi khinchaa tha
 One of them was Munnar uncle with 'samohi Kheti' in the Soviet Union, Sonai called Dage as 'dangaria' and the third was Dardial Zaidi uncle
 unke dadhi-moonch rakhane kaa rahasy mere mastishk main tab khulaa jab san 1978-79 main iran par shodh ke dauraan mujhe pataa chalaa ki vahaan ke gilaan praant ke mirza kuchek khan naamak ek krantikari ke netritv main san 1910 tathaa 20 ke dashak main hajaaron yuvakon ne kasam khai thi ki jab tak ve angrej samrajyavad ko iran kii dharti se bhaga nahin denge tab tak ve dadhi-moonch badhaate rahenge tathaa ghar chhodkar jangal main rahenge
 His movement in Iran is called 'jungle Movement' and revolutionaries are called Junglee
 mirza kuchek khan lenin se patr vyavhaar bhi karte the
 Apparently, Zaidi Chacha must have heard something about these Iranian foresters during his stay in Baghdad, that is why he took the path of his revolt against Bansu Pandey, due to which he gave up his life, but not the revolutionary ideal Left
 aise the bhukkhad krantikari baghdad ritern 'jaidi' chachaa

 chaaron ke paas court se raahat lene kaa koi khaas vikalp nahincurative pitishan kanoonee adhikaar nahin, kanoonee vikalpanirbhaya ke saath gang rape karne vaale sabhi doshi nichali adaalat se lekar supreme court tak faansee kii sajaa paa chuke hai to sabake man main yah sawaal uthta he ki is vibhats ghatana ke 7 saal ke baad bhi abhi tak nirbhaya ke doshiyon ko faansee kyon nahin di gai he
 In 2018 itself, the Supreme Court also rejected the appeal of the four convicts of the Nirbhaya case while upholding their death sentence
 supreme court se apil khaarij hone ke baad in chaaron ke paas court se raahat lene kaa koi khaas vikalp nahin he
 Curative petition is also used in those rare cases in which you are able to find fundamental errors in the court's judgment and it is clear that the court order can be overturned
 sajaa milane ke bare main nirbhaya kii maa aashaa devi ne kaha, 'main nirbhaya maamle main doshiyon main se ek doshi kii dayaa yachika khaarij kiye jane ke dilli sarkaar ke suzav kaa swaagat karti hum
 i hope the culprits get the death penalty as soon as possible
 'curative pitishan kanoonee adhikaar nahinhaalanki doshiyon ke curative pitishan naa lagane kii surat main bhi faansee di ja sakati he kyonki curative pitishan lagaana unka kanoonee adhikaar nahin he, balki yah kanoonee vikalp he
 In case of Nirbhaya, even if curative petition appears, she will be dismissed immediately
 isiilie is maamle ko or lanbaa khinchne ke liye doshiyon kii taraf se curative pitishan nahin lagaai gai he
 The way forward is for amnesty, that if the mercy petition is presented to the President after he is hanged from the Supreme Court and he accepts it, then the death sentence is often converted to life imprisonment
 raham kii ummid cameraashtrapati dayaa yachika ko sweekaar karenge yaa asweekaar, yah centre sarkaar ke grih mantralay or kanoon mantralay se mili suzav ke aadhaar par raashtrapati dwaara apane vivek kaa istemaal karte hue tay kiya jaataa he, lekin is maamle main uske asaar bhi bahut kam najar aa rahe hai kyonki nichali adaalat se lekarsupreme court tak ne is puure maamle parkisi tarah kii koi raham nirbhaya ke cese ke doshiyon par nahin barti he
 The barbarism of which Nirbhaya was gangraped has shaken the entire nation, there is no hope of getting relief from anywhere
 sawaal phir bhi vahi he ki aakhir abhi tak in chaaron ko faansee kyon nahin di gai he
 So the reason for this is that neither has the legal option of curative petition been used till now
 iske alaava raashtrapati ke paas dayaa yachika bhi 4 main se sirf ek hi ne lagaai he, par vah abhi raashtrapati ke paas lambit he
 That is, if the President dismisses the mercy petition or curative petition in the Supreme Court before that, then the way of hanging these four will be cleared
 jiske baad seshan court ko is maamle main deth warrant jari karnaa hota he, warrant ke milane ke baad jail prashasan faansee dene kii taiyaariyon ko amalijama pahanaataa he
 How long will the hanging take? Recently Nirbhayya's parents petitioned the Patiala House Court for the early execution of these four, on which the court has issued a notice to these four convicts to tell them till December 13 that In the case, whether he wants to apply mercy petition to the President or curative petition in the Supreme Court, put his side before the court
 yani is maamle main 13 disambar ko hone vaali sunwaayee behad mahatvapurn hogi kyonki court main daakhil kiye gaye in chaaron ke jawaab se yah tay ho jayega ki nirbhaya ke doshiyon ko faansee par chadhaane main kitna or vakt laganaa baaki he
 This means that even though the Supreme Court has given its order within 6 years from the fast track court in this case, it is difficult to say how long it will take to hang

 This incident created a stir in the country's politics

 katl ke maamle main wo umr kaid kii sazaa kaat rahaa he
 That is, he is currently in jail
 phir pichley hafte hi ye ilzaam laga ki wo jail se hi rangadari vasuul rahaa he or ab ek nai tasviir ke saath wo khud saamne aata he
 By making handcuffs a jewel, he bursts all the laws of the law inside the court premises
 phir jab itane par bhi uskaa man nahin bharta to wo bhuule bisare geet sunaanaa shuru kar detaa he
 When and where did you see this criminal at such a place before this? When did you see a criminal before wearing handcuffs like jewelry in one hand? Have you ever seen any criminal distributing leaflets wearing jewelery handcuffs inside the court premises? Now let me tell you the scene inside the court premises
 yah apradhi baqayada mez sajaa kar khullamakhulla media se bhi mukhaatib ho gaya
 Now you will say that, why do they put such a ruckus on their hand or handcuffs? So forgive because the mistake is ours
 asal main ham aapako ye bataanaa to bhul hi gaye ki ye sahab katl ke maamle main baqayada umrakaid kii sazaa kataa rahe hai
 And these are the same gentlemen who have been accused of asking for extortion of seven crores from jail in the past
 ji han
 The name of this criminal is Munna Shukla
 netaa se bahubali bane yaa bahubali se netaa
 Leave this debate
 par philhal katl ke maamle main umr kaid kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Now since the account of the crime is a little larger, it is often required to go out of jail and appear in other courts for the accounting of other crimes
 aisi hi ek haaziri shuukravaar ko mujffarpur adaalat main lagi
 Here, a murder trial is going on
 par bahubali hone ke saath-saath bhai chunki purv vidhayak bhi hai lihaaja puure jalwe ke saath court padhaare
 The media joined hands, thanking them for making them famous by showing news of extortion
 baat itane par hi nahin rukii
 Munna ji also had to say something else
 lihaaza hansi-thitholi ke bich court parisar ke andar hi mez sajaa di or apane tevar main rangadari vasuulne ke iljaam par dabangai andaaj main jawaab bhi diya
 Now that Shukla ji is the leader of the ruling party in Bihar, it would be a waste of time to think or believe that what action would be taken against those who make a murderer such a hero and wearing jewels in the name of handcuffs? All that the government did was to suspend a sub-inspector and five soldiers to allow the distribution of leaflets

 Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee on Saturday hinted at ending the alliance with the Congress and said her party was capable of running the government alone in the state
 vahiin congress ne palatwaar karte hue ise 'vishwasghaat' bataaya or kaha ki logon ne gathbandhan ko vot diya tha
 Addressing a public meeting here, Mamta said, "we are capable of running the government alone in the state
 hamaare paas paryaapt bahumat he
 We are not dependent on anyone
 ham bengal main akele hi chunaav ladenge
 We are not at the mercy of anyone
 yah hamaara apana sangharsh he
 We have a majority to run the government
 " unhone spasht rup se kaha ki centre main haalanki unki party kaa congress ke saath gathbandhan kaayam rahegaa, basharte unke saath aadar or garimapurna vyavhaar ho

 State Congress President Pradeep Bhattacharya said, "trinamool has been alone and contested alone, we have no problem
 ham pehle hi kah chuke hai ki hamaara rukh party alaakaman tay karegi
 But his assertion that he does not need the Congress is a betrayal not only of the rules of the alliance, but also of the people of Bengal, who voted for the alliance, not the Trinamool
 " Angered Bhattacharya attacked the Trinamool leadership by saying, "mamata should have shown her strength by going against the alliance even before the assembly elections last year
" " Significantly, although the Congress and Trinamool have an alliance between the state and the Center, both have been at loggerheads on various issues
 mudde chaahe raashtrapati chunaav se jude hon yaa lokapal vidheyak se yaa khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kaa mudda ho
 On the other hand, the Congress leadership of the state has been accusing the Trinamool-led state government of failing in violence and other matters
 mamata ne kaha, "rajya ke kuch congress netaa makapa (marxvaadi communist party) samarthit televijan channelon ke studio main baithte hai or hamaari sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue vyaakhyaan dete hai, jaise ham unki dayaa par sarkaar chalaa rahe hon

 Especially since Mamta decided to oppose the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee

 The comments mamata ne haalanki baad main apana rukh badla or pranab kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya, phir bhi donon dalon ke bich daraar chaudee hoti ja rahi he
 Earlier, on several occasions, the Trinamool leadership has been calling the state Congress as team-b of the opposition CPI-M and alleging that the Congress along with the Marxists have been impeding various developmental activities in the state
 yahaan ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue mamata ne kaha, "ham rajya main akele sarkaar chalaane main sakasham hai
 We have a substantial majority
 ham kisi par nirbhar nahin hai
 We will contest elections alone in Bengal
 ham kisi kii dayaa par tike hue nahin hai
 This is our own struggle
 sarkaar chalaane ke liye hamaare paas bahumat he
 "he clearly stated that his party's alliance with the Congress at the Center, however, would remain, provided he was treated with respect and dignity
 " The state Congress retaliated on Mamata's statement

" nahin, unhen pataa hona chahie ki ve hamaari vajah se yahaan hai

 " The relationship between the ruling coalition partners in the state has become bitter in recent times

 Earlier, on several occasions, the Trinamool leadership has been calling the state Congress as team-b of the opposition CPI-M and alleging that the Congress along with the Marxists have been impeding various developmental activities in the state
 gauratlab he ki congress or trinmul kaa haalanki rajya or centre main gathbandhan he, phir bhi vibhinn muddon par donon main takaraar hoti rahi he
 Whether it is related to the presidential election or the Lokpal Bill or the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector
 duusari ore, rajya kaa congress netritv trinmul kii aguwai vaali rajya sarkaar par hinsa va anya maamalon main vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 Mamta said, "some Congress leaders of the state sit in the studios of CPI (marxist Communist Party) supported television channels and give lectures criticizing our government as if we were running the government at their mercy
" nahin, unhen pataa hona chahie ki ve hamaari vajah se yahaan hai
 Their (state Congress) work is only to abuse us
 " The relationship between the ruling coalition partners in the state has become bitter in recent times
 khaskar tab se jab mamata ne sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar pranab mukherjee kaa virodh karne kaa faisla liya
 The angry Congress leadership of the state even called him 'anti-bengali'
 tippaniyan Although Mamata later changed her stance and supported Pranab's candidature, the rift between the two parties is widening
 isse pehle kai maukon par trinmul netritv rajya congress ko vipakshi makapa kii team-bi bataata rahaa he or aarope lagaataa rahaa he ki congress marxvaadiyon ke saath milakar rajya main chal rahe vibhinn vikaas kaaryo main adnga lagaati rahi he
 On the other hand, the Congress leadership of the state has been accusing the Trinamool-led state government of failing in violence and other matters
 mamata ne kaha, "rajya ke kuch congress netaa makapa (marxvaadi communist party) samarthit televijan channelon ke studio main baithte hai or hamaari sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue vyaakhyaan dete hai, jaise ham unki dayaa par sarkaar chalaa rahe hon
 No, they should know that they are here because of us
 unka (rajya congress) kaam keval hamen gaali dena he
 " rajya main sattarudh gathbandhan ke saajhedaaron ke bich sambandh main haal ke dinon main kadavaahat bhar gai he
 Especially since Mamta decided to oppose the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee

 Megharich said that due to social issues as well as social media, people are getting attracted to this terrorist organization
 hamen un par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 <educated boys who earn well, they are also going towards terror
 On this question, Delhi Police Commissioner Bhim Singh Bassi said that terror is not new for India
 80 ke dashak se hi isko ham jhel rahe hai, jo aaj bhi jari he
 Promoting terrorists from social media, he said that a new face of Indian Muslim youth had emerged as Indian Mujahideen
 bharat naujavaanon ko gumraah karke aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil kiya gaya
 Such activities have received a boost through social media
 aatanki gatividhiyon par rahati he najarabassi ne kaha ki yah koi jaruri nahin he ki jiske paas paisa ho wo aatank kii taraf nahin badhegaa
 We keep an eye on the people involved in terrorist activities

 Ever since the issue of the proposal to withdraw Bharat Ratna from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came up in the Delhi Assembly, the Congress has been looking very aggressive
 dilli congress ke netaa ajay maakan ne behad talkh shabdon main aam aadmi party ko prastaav waapas lene or maafee maangane kii chetavanee di thi
 At the same time, on Sunday, the Youth Congress protested vigorously at the ITO Aam Aadmi Party headquarters
 is dauraan utsaahi kaaryakartaaon ne jamkar narebaaji kii or daftar ke baahar lage bade-bade hordings or banners ko faad daalaa
 Actually, the performance of Congress workers was against the Aam Aadmi Party
 is dauraan kaaryakartaaon ne aam aadmi party ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji kii or kejariwal kaa istipha bhi maanga
 Earlier on Saturday, the Delhi Congress unit had staged a strong protest outside the Aam Aadmi Party office
 uskaa netritv dilli congress adhyaksh ajay maakan ne kiya tha
 Congress is running 'kejriwal Apologize' campaign; Delhi Congress has consistently campaigned against Aam Aadmi Party
 soshal media se lekar dilli kii sadakon tak lage postaron main congress dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa istipha maang rahi he, party ne soshal media par kejariwal maafee maangen hashtag bhi chalaaya tha
 However, the performance of the Delhi Congress does not seem to have much impact on the Aam Aadmi Party
 party is mudde par jawaab dena bhi uchit nahin samajhati
 The possibilities of a collapsing coalition! The prospects of an alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party for the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi now seem even weaker
 congress kii dilli ikai shuru se hi is gathbandhan ke khilaaf najar aa rahi thi
 Ajay Maken had on several occasions completely rejected the alliance's prospects
 lekin atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki shaayad sheersh netritv dilli main aam aadmi party se gathbandhan par sahmati bana de lekin ab jab dilli vidhansabha main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke bharat ratna vaapasi vaale prastaav kaa mudda uthaa tab se congress kii nigaah aam aadmi party se puri tarah se tedi ho gai
 In such a situation, the prospects of the alliance are also very low
 jahaan ek taraf kapil sharma ke liye mushkilen thamane kaa naam nahin le raheen vahiin duusari taraf dhire-dhire unhen tivi industry kaa saath bhi mil rahaa he
 After Krishna Abhishek and Shilpa Shinde, it is now reported that famous TV comedian Bharti Singh has also come in support of Kapil
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan unhone kapil kii tarifon ke pul baandhe hai
 He has said that Kapil is very polite and he is also helpful in conduct
 unhone aage kaha ki mujhe pataa he ki kapil aajkal abhadra bhashaa kaa prayog karne ke maamle main vivaadon se ghire hue hai par mujhe yakeen he ki kapil sabakuch kar sakate hai par befijul kisi kaa apmaan yaa kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes nahin pahunchaa sakate
 Kapil Case: The shoe-taker forgot, the eater still remembers that both Bharti and Kapil are good friends in real life
 wo kapil ke sho kamedi nits vid kapil ke kuch episods main kaam karti hui najar aa chuki hai
 Recently he has been criticized a lot due to a dispute with a journalist
 soshal media par unhen durvyavhaari or ghamandi kaha ja rahaa he
 Let us tell you that on Friday evening also Kapil abused spotboye for spreading fake news from his twitter account
 haalanki baad main unhone ye twits delit kar diya tha
 After that Kapil had said in a tweet that my account was hacked
 haalanki ye twit bhi ab delit ho chukaa he
 She wrote a letter against whom Kapil is trying to help you; Apart from this, his show Family Times with Kapil Sharma has also been closed for the time being
 khabaron kii maane to kapil sharma ke baar-baar sho ke shoot ko cancel karne ke kaaran sho ke aayojakon ne ye kadam uthaaya he
 The show has been suspended for 1 month
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab apane sansadeey kshetra kaashi ko kioto banane kii baat kahi tab kaashi ko jaanane or samajhane waalon ke zehan main yah sawaal baar-baar aayaa ki itihaas se bhi puraani nagari kaashi ko koi 600 saal puraane itihaas vaale kioto ke samaan kyon bananaa chahta he? kya yah ghoshnaa soch samajhakar kii gai yaa iske peeche sirf kaashi or kioto kii shabdic tukbandi bhar thi ?kaashi ko kioto banane ke isi kram main kaashi vishwanath mandir ke vistarikaran ke liye banaras ke lalita ghat se vishwanath mandir tak do sau se adhik bhawan chinhit kiye gaye hai, jinhen todaa ja rahaa he
 These include about 50 ancient temples and monasteries
 ye sabhi kaashi vishwanath coridor kii zad main aane vaale mandir hai
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda, a disciple of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda, who was agitating to protect these ancient temples, the Deities, is sitting on a 12-day fast
 swami avimukteshwaranand kaa kahana he ki kaashi kaa pakkaa mahal aise vaastu vidhaan se bana he jise swayan bhagwaan shiv ne murtarup diya tha
 In such a situation, due to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, destroying the mythological temples and Deities of Pakka Mahal will destroy Kashi itself
 nasht ho jaaegi kashiswami avimukteshwaranand kaa aajtak
 In a special conversation with in, it is said that the only firm Mahal is Kashi's mind, brain and heart
 pakkaa mahal aise vaastu vidhaan se bana he jise swayan bhagwaan shiv ne murtarup diya tha
 In such a situation, there is a danger of Kashi being destroyed
 yah sirf kaashi ke ek hisse pakkaa mahal yaa yahaan rahane waalon kii baat nahin he balki sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii aasthaa kaa prashn he
 People come to Kashi from different parts of the country after reading the Puranas / scriptures to see their deities
 aise main jab ve kaashi aaenge tab jarur puuchhenge ki unke devi devtaa kahaan gaye?ise padhein: filon se kab niklegi kioto jaisi kaashi, banaras kaa sirf yahi sawalram mandir se bhi bada he muddaswami avimukteshwaranand aage kehete hai ki yah vishay ramajanm bhoomi se bhi bada he
 Because there is only one temple in Ayodhya
 lekin yahaan hamaare puraanon ke uparokt parampara se poojit anek mandiron kii baat he
 Right now we are protesting according to the scriptures
 lekin yadi sarkaar raajnneeti se prerit hokar yah apeksha karegi ki vah janadbaav se hi maanegi tab ham janata kaa aahvaan bhi karenge
 In such a situation, the question will surely arise that why did the party which came to power in the name of building the temple destroyed the temples? Swami Avimukteshwarananda says that we are not against any plan of the government
 sarkarein janata ke hit main hi koi yojanaayen laati hai
 Our only opposition is that no Deities and temples should be humiliated, not kept untouched, they should not be removed from their place
 itnaa surakshit rakhte hue yadi coridor kaa nirmaan ho to hamen koi aapatti nahin
 What is the significance of Pakka Mahal? The concept of Pakka Mahal is from eighty to Rajghat on the banks of the Ganges of Kashi
 kaha jaataa he ki kaashi ko jaananaa samajhnaa ho to pakkaa mahal ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 This area itself holds many cultures
 desh kaa aisa koi rajya nahin jiskaa pratinidhitiv pakkaa mahal na karata ho
 The ancient buildings of the princely states of different states and the mythical temples and deities worshiped there are located in this area
 jinke darshan karne puure desh se log aate hai
 Bengali, Nepali, Gujarati, South Indian communities in Pakka Mahal have their own localities
 kaashi main vikaas ke bahut se kaary hue hai lekin puranic mahatv rakhane vaale dharoharon ko kabhi nasht nahin kiya gaya, na hi inhe chhedaa gaya
 But today the same mahal of Kashi is going to face development
 hajaaron hajaar saal puraani viraasat ko mitaane kii sajeesh ko vikaas jama pahana diya gaya he
 Due to which the pucca mahal called Kashi's heart is a bit like these days

 The Shiv Sena has now shifted to Pandharpur after organizing a Dharma Sabha for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh
 maharashtra ke pramukh dharmik sthal ke rup main pahchaan rakhane vaale pangarpur se shivasena apane sahyog se bijepi ke netritv main chal rahi rajya sarkaar ko gheregi
 a huge Dharam Sabha has been organized here, which Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will address
 somvaar ko shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main isaki jaankaree di gai he
 However, the mouthpiece also claims that the purpose of Dharam Sabha of Pandharpur is more religious than political
 lekin ye bhi kaha gaya he ki maharashtra kii janata ke liye yojit is dharm sabha se rajya kii janata ke liye he or kamjor sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye he
 It has been told in the encounter that Maharashtra will be the center of development of Shiv Sena chief's speech

 The ideology of Prashant Kishore, the political strategist considered to be the biggest face behind the victory of Narendra Modi at the Center and Nitish Kumar in Bihar, is unable to embrace the Congress workers
 yahi vajah he ki party abhi tak upi main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar koi thos ranneeti nahin bana pai he
 On the one hand, on the occasion of the completion of two years of the NDA government, the BJP has made a conclave for the UP assembly elections, on the other hand, the Congress camp is yet to decide on the electoral issue

 Prashant Kishore had suggested Rahul Gandhi to be the Uttar Pradesh Chief Ministerial candidate and Priyanka Vadra to lead the election campaign
 lekin unke in idia ko sidline kar diya gaya
 Kishore had suggested a Brahmin leader to be the party chief in place of the party's state head Nirmal Khatri

 On the other hand, many activists are complaining that interference in the internal works of Prashant Kishore Party is also increasing
 congress ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki kishor kii bhoomika punjab or uttar pradesh ke chunaavon main ghoshnaa patr taiyaar karne main suzav dene tak hi simit rahegi

 ’ Elaborating on the controversy arising out of a recent statement by senior Congress leader AK Antony, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President VM Sudhiran on Sunday said his senior colleague's comment was "kerala-centric and he had good intentions"
 '' Significantly, Antony had given a statement recently that the confidence of the people in the Congress's commitment to secularism has decreased slightly
 sudheeran ne trichur main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'antni ne kerala main congress or udief ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah bayaan diya tha
 His motives were correct and his motive was to direct the party and coalition in the right direction
 ' Antony had said at a party program here two days ago that it seems that the confidence of the people in the Congress's commitment to secularism has decreased a bit and it is necessary to gain public confidence to move forward

 i dnt participate in fantsy leagues — Sourav Ganguly (@ sganguly99) April 27, 2017 Earlier criticism: Let us know that earlier on the poor form of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in IPL, former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a champion player in ODI international
 , But he doubted that he is still a good player in the shortest format of the game, T20
 ganguli ne kaha ki mujhe pakkaa yakeen nahin he ki dhoni achche tii-20 khilaadi hai
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that due to the poor form of their top batsmen, the team had to face defeat in the ICC T20 World Cup Super Eight to South Africa
 bharat kii majboot ballebaaji 131 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 118 ran hi bana paayi or is tarah se use super aath main lagaataar teesri haar jhelni padi
 Dhoni blamed the batsmen for the defeat
 top ke ballebaajon ne kiya niraashaunhone match ke baad kaha ki main nahin maanata ki yahaan kii paristhitiyaan koi mudda he
 Some of our key players including myself are responsible for this defeat
 dhoni ne kaha ki ham chah mukhya ballebaajon ke saath khel rahe the or saatvaan alrounder he
 When three of these batsmen are unable to run in such a match, the difficulty really increases
 puure toornament main main apane gendbaajon ke pradarshan se khush rahaa lekin ballebaaji main ham apekshanuroop pradarshan nahin kar paye
 The Indian captain said that we did not really play to our potential in batting and this happened in the entire tournament with a bad attitude
 dhoni ne haalanki team ke prashansakon se agle saal ke april main westeindies main hone vaali championships main behatar pradarshan karne kaa vaada kiya
 He said that i hope that when we return again after nine months, we will do well with better preparations

 On Wednesday, the UPA government is going to present the interim railway budget and it is trying to get voters through it
 iske liye vah rail tikaton kii daren to nahin ghataaegi lekin kai nai trainon ke shuru karne kii ghoshnaa karegi
 It is said that most ministers and mps of the UPA government have requested the Railway Minister to give a new train to their area or to declare the stops of important trains there
 chunaav sir par dekhakar ye netaa rail mantralay par kaaphi dawaab bana rahe hai
 Anyway, the leaders of India contribute a lot to start new trains in India
 is saal bhi rail mantri mallikarjun khadge par kaaphi dawaab he or vah rasta dhund rahe hai taaki adhik se adhik mantriyon-saansadon ko khush kar saken
 Kharge is the most senior in age and at this time he is engaged in balancing
 rail mantri kii sabase badi samasya yah he ki relon ke parichaalan main kharch badhata ja rahaa he or uski aarthik sthiti aisi nahin he ki rail kiraaye main kami kii ja sake
 Statistics show that the operating cost of the railways has increased by Rs 5,000 crore more than the budget in april-december period
 yani uskaa ghaataa badhata ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, his earnings have come down by Rs 3,000 crores
 railway maal dhulaai main bhi apane lakshya tak nahin pahunch paa rahi he
 Therefore, there is no question of reducing rail fares
 lekin janata ko khush karne ke liye vah kai nai railgadiyon kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Apart from this, many major steps will be taken to improve the information system of the Railways
 iske tahat steshnon par aane-jane vaali trainon ke bare main sateek soochna dene kii vyavastha kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, automatic ticket vending machines will also be installed at many stations
 steshnon main yatriyon ko or suvidhaayen dene ke liye kai kadamon kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 The Railway Minister may also announce the extension and halt of several trains
 unhone saansadon tathaa anya netaaon kii kuch maangen maan bhi lee hai or uske tahat nai linon ke survey kiye ja sakate hai
 People will be happy in those areas also
 iske alaava kai bheedbhad vaale ilaakon main rail pul banane kii bhi vah ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 Due to the indiscriminate development of cities, there has been heavy congestion at the rail gates due to which traffic jams have also become a problem in many cities
 vahaan ke saansad aisi kai maangen rail mantri ke saamne rakh chuke hai
 Many of these will be allowed
 rail mantriyon kii populist nitiyon kaa hi nateeja he ki desh main rail linon kaa nirmaan bahut kam ho rahaa he
 The length of rail lines built in 63 years of independence in India was made in China in just five years (2006–11)
 rail kiraaye samay par na badhaane se relon ke parichaalan main ghaataa hone laga he or railway kii tamaam yojanaon par prashn chinh lag gaya he

 Literal name development has got mixed like syrup in election slogans these days
 har raajnneetik dal apane phaayde ke liye iskaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 Separate promotional programs focused on 'development' have brought the term into disrepute in the general public
 log apane bacchon ke naam vikaas rakhane se baukhalaaye hue hai
 Nowadays people have reduced the name of new born children to development
 pradhanmantri narendra modijab se vikaas shabd kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kiya he, tab se vikaas shabd bijepi ke liye brands kii tarah ban gaya he
 The common people do not want to be a part of this politics
 kai log kehete hai ki vikaas dikhaai nahin de rahaa he, to koi kahata he ki dekho, vikaas aa rahe hai
 Superintendent in Rajkot Metropolitan Municipality P
 ve
 Joshi said that people have reduced the name of children as development
 2016 ke aankadon ke mutabik us saal 34 hajaar bachche register hue hai
 Of these, 16 thousand children are male
 agar shabdic naam vikaas kii baat karen, to inkaa rate bahut kam ho gaya he
 The names of less than 10 children are named Vikas
 joshi ne kaha ki 2017 main ab tak 28 hajaar bacchon ke registration hue hai
 Out of these 16 thousand children are male, out of which only 7-8 children have been named Vikas
 in aankadon se saaf he ki aam janamanas ab 'vikaas' se duuri bana rahaa he
 Although the names are many, but people are seen running away from bjp's brand development
 khud bijepi ke kai kaaryakarta apane bacchon kaa naam vikaas nahin rakhana chaahate hai, aam logon kii baat dur kii he
 Let me tell you that in the Gujarat election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has 'hoon Chhu Vikas'
 
 
 hum chhun gujarat yani 'main hi vikaas hum

e
 'vikas Gaya Gaya Hai'
 rajkot congress ke pramukh indranit raajaguru ne kaha ki log apane bacchon kaa naam vikaas nahin rakh rahe hai, ye saaf ho gaya he
 People think that if the child's name is kept development, then he will become like a magician and will start showing dreams to the parents
 vikaas kii itani baar ripetesan hui or vikaas jaisaa kuch hua nahin
 He said that the whole of Gujarat is saying that development has gone mad
 hamaare mukhyamantri bolte hai ki 'main vikaas hum' to ye logon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 Modi's magic is complete in Gujarat
 bijepi ko apana agenda badalanaa padaa he
 Now let's say that we will fight on nationalism, not on development
 saaf he ki aam log apane jivan main raajnneeti nahin laana chaahate hai
 By keeping the name Vikas, he feels that when the child grows up, he will go away as a mere joke
 gujarat main soshal media par vikaas gando thayo che (vikaas pagal hua he) chal rahaa he
 The BJP and the Congress are engaged in development-focused campaigning
 rajkot ke rahane vaale mehul gohil ne kaha, 'mere yahan bachche kaa janm hua
 i took a review of my friends that if i name the child, then they said keep development
 phir maine sochaa ki abhi jo soshal media main jo ye chal rahaa he
 Because of that, i did not name the child as Vikas
 rajkot ke hi rahane vaale kailash chudasma ne kaha ki apane bachche kaa naam vikaas kadaapi nahin rakhuunga
 Right now there is a campaign called Vikas Pagal in social media
 har taraf vikaas kaa hi naaraa lag rahaa he
 It has become so viral that people everywhere say that Vikas has gone mad
 abhi meri wif pregnent hai, agar ladkaa hua to uskaa naam vikaas kadaapi nahin rakhuunga

 Everyone tells what should be done to keep the relationship strong, but it is also very important to know what should not be done
 kai baar aisa hota he ki premi jode kuch aisa kar baithte hai jisaki vajah se unke rishte main tanaav shuru ho jaataa he jiskaa parinaam se hota he ki sambandhon main daraar aa jaati he
 But if it comes to know that these things can damage the relationship, the relationship can be handled by not doing them
 rishta bananaa bahut aasaan he lekin use ek khushhaal rishta bananaa bahut mushkil hota he
 In such a situation, if you wish, you can handle your relationship to a great extent by avoiding these things
 is sambandh main ek baat jaananaa bahut jaruri he or wo ye ki koi bhi rishta na to ek din main kharaab ho jaataa he or na hi use ek hi din main thik kiya ja sata he
 This is a process that takes time
 khushhaal rishte ke liye kabhi na karen ye baaten:1
 Do not add others to your problems
 Happy couples never put their problems and objections in front of others
 chaahe wo parivaar ke sadsy hi kyon na hon ve apni har samasya ko aamane-saamne baithkar sulajhane main yakeen rakhte hai
 2
 apane rishte kii tulana kisi or se nahin kartekhushhaal rishte ke liye ye bahut jaruri he ki aap apane rishte kii tulana kabhi bhi kisi or se na karen
 Instead of improving relations, it worsens
 kisi or kapal se apane rishte kii tulana karnaa aapaki asuraksha kii bhavnako jataata he
 3
 dosha dene se bachencemajhadaar kapal hi khushhaal joda ban saktaa he
 Battles take place everywhere
 kuch log ladaai ke dauraan ek-duusare par dosha daalane lagate hai aisa karnaa aapke rishte ko kamjor bana saktaa he
 It is better to blame either one and consider their own fault and try to solve it
 4
 Do not try to read minds
 Happy couples believe in the truth
 ve apane se kayaasein nahin lagaate hai
 It is better to make speculations than ask yourself the truth by sitting in front of you, this will greatly reduce the chances of misunderstanding between you

 They keep telling me that if we are happy together then what is the need to do all this

 Is Divyanka expecting any surprise from Vivek? is par unhone kaha, 'main unase koi ummid nahin kar rahi
 If i come to know that they too have fasted, i will forcefully feed them something
 kyonki main jaanati hum wo bhukhe nahin rah sakate
 We will also go to dinner at night

 His film 'dhoom 3' is also going to be released very soon

 He also narrated stories of the shooting
 dhooma 3 main pehali baar ection karne ko lekar
 
 
 Aamir is seen doing tremendous action in Dhoom 3
 unhone bataaya, 'ek arase se maine ection nahin kiya tha
 On one hand, preparations are on for the second season of Satyamev Jayate
 duusari taraf dhooma 3 ke liye sarkas kii training yaa phir tap dance chal rahaa tha
 At the moment the movie work has been completed
 bas pramotion kaa kuch hissaa baaki he
 Right now the focus is on Satyamev Jayate
 uski kahani, uske chehre saamne ghoomte rahete hai
 Aamir said that he is unable to do a lot of things at once
 aisa 13 saal baad ho rahaa he ki unhone do filmein ek saath shoot kin
 These films are PK and Dhoom 3
 dhooma 3 kii taiyaari kaa kissaamir ne bataaya ki dhooma 3 kii shooting ke dauraan vah single disit body fat tak pahunch gaye the
 Now it has reached 17-18
 par isamen body par itnaa focus nahin he
 He told, 'when i was told the story by producer Aditya Chopra
 to maine kaha ki haa, yaar main karuunga, par mujhe ek saal chahie role kii taiyaari ke liye
 He felt strange why a year was needed
 to maine kaha yaar jimnast kii taiyaari kerani hogi
 He said, you are looking magar main ada rahaa
 Today he also says that this decision was correct
 ''film kii kamai myne nahin rakhti'jab aamir se 100 karod kamai club ke dabaav ke bare main poocha gaya to vah bole, 'dabaav sirf itnaa hota he ki jo paise kharch kar tikat kharid rahaa he, use ye na lage ki paise kharaab ho gaye
 It is a worry whether it is entertainment or not
 meri sabase favorit film 'pyaasa' or 'mughal-e-ajam' hai
 i don't know how much they earned
 ultimetali film aapke dil main chooti he, jagah banaati he
 How much he earned does not matter
 main bas itnaa chahta hum ki log meri film dekhen or ye unke liye yaadgaar vakya ho
 "loss to not want someone" When Aamir was asked that if the film does not run commercially, then it will not make any difference, then he said that he will definitely be sad because a film costs a lot
 unhone kaha, 'to meri jimmedaari he ki jinhone paisa lagaaya he, unka waapas ho jaae or 10-15 fisadi munafa bhi ho jaae
 So i don't want to lose
 kamai kitni zyada ho jaae, 200 karod ho jaae
 He does not care much about it
 'aamir filmon ko lekar bahut chuji maane jate hai
 When he was questioned on the election of Dhoom-3, he said that he liked its story, character and twist
 unhone bataaya ki yah kahani bahut jajbaati bhi he
 Aamir told, "I had tears in my eyes when i heard narration
 isamen sab kuch he, ection he, stant he
 There are big songs

 Border Security Force (BSF) sacked soldier Tej Bahadur Yadav's plans to contest elections from Varanasi against Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been revoked
 tej bahadur kaa namakan buudhvaar ko radd ho gaya
 Tej Bahadur Yadav along with his lawyer came to meet the Returning Officer on Wednesday to answer the notice issued by the Returning Officer
 jiske baad nirvachan adhikari ne tej bahadur ke namakan patr ko khaarij kar diya
 Tej Bahadur Yadav first nominated an independent then Samajwadi Party (SP) election symbol
 ek namakan-patr main unhone bataaya tha ki unhen bhrashtachar ke kaaran sena se barkhaast kiya gaya tha lekin duusare namakan main unhone isaki jaankaree nahin di thi
 After scrutiny of the pamphlets on Tuesday, the District Election Office issued notice to Tejbahadur giving time to reply by May 1
 vahiin, ab nae sameekaran ke tahat shalini yadav sapa kii taraf se chunavi maidan main pradhanmantri modi ko takkar de sakati hai
 However, it depends on whether the SP gives its election symbol to Shalini Yadav or not
 9 janvari, 2017 ko haryana ke rewadi ke tej bahadur yadav ne javaanon ko parose ja rahe khaane kaa video saarvajanik kar puure desh kaa maahaul garma diya tha
 Yadav had posted some videos, in which he questioned the quality of food, showing only turmeric and salt dal and the rotis that were burnt together
 video main unhone kaha tha ki pakistan se satee niyantran rekha samet kai sthanon par is prakaar kaa khaanaa diya jaataa he or kai baar javaanon ko bhukhe pet sona padataa he
 After the video went viral on social media, the Prime Minister's Office had sought a detailed report on the matter from the Union Home Ministry and the BSF
 is bich tejbahadur ne viares ke liye aavedan kiya tha, jise manjuur nahin kiya gaya balki unhen nirdesh diya gaya ki jab tak jaanch puri nahin ho jaati, vah biguef nahin chhod sakate
 In protest, Tej Bahadur sat on a hunger strike at the Rajouri headquarters
 19 april ko tej bahadur ko biguef se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 He was investigated for breaking the Border Security Force's discipline
 barkhaast kiye jane ke baad tejbahadur ne faujee ekta nyaay kalyaan manch naamak ek enjio banaaya or ab varanasi se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main kud gaye
 Now the question is, what can be the impact on the election battle of Benaras after the cancellation of SP candidate Tej Bahadur's form
 takneekee taur par iskaa bahut bada fark nahin padane vaala kyonki tej bahadur agar ladaai se baahar hue hai to shalini yadav kaa pravesh bhi sambhav hua he lekin shalini yadav kaa siyaasi kad aisa nahin he ki ve pradhanmantri modi ke voton par asar daal saken
 To understand this, we have to look at the last election
 2014 ke chunaav main bhi sapa ne banaras main apana ummidavaar utaara tha
 The BSP also gave its candidate
 yah alag baat he ki us chunaav main sapa or basapa alag alag chunaav lade the lekin donon ke vot kaa ganit kaaphi nishprabhavi rahaa tha
 In 2014, Kailash Chaurasia of SP got 45,291 votes and bsp's Vijay Prakash Jaiswal got 60,579 votes
 haalanki us vakt aam aadmi party ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal bada factor the jinhen do lakh se kuch adhik vot mila tha
 Ajay Rai is also from the Congress side and this time too, but he also left no impact
 ajay raay tisare sthaan par rahe the
 He also stood third in the Pindra seat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections after that
 lagaataar do chunaav haar chuke raay ko bhi congress is baar majboot ummidavaar bataa rahi he
 This time there is no big face like Arvind Kejriwal from Banaras, so it can be considered that anti-bjp votes are a go-ahead for Congress and SP candidates, but it will not sharpen that Narendra Modi's victory gets a break
 ab baat shalini yadav kii
 SP-BSP alliance candidate Shalini Yadav's family has an old relationship with the Congress
 ve congress ke divangat netaa or rajyasabha ke purv upasabhapati shyaamalaal yadav kii putravadhu hai
 He was elected only 1 in the election of Mayor in Benares
 13 lakh vot mili the or vah chunaav haar gai thim
 It is easy to guess how effective Shalini Yadav's impact will be on the Varanasi Lok Sabha elections
 congress or sapa-basapa gathbandhan chaahe jo kahen lekin narendra modi ke khilaaf jaise ummidavaar utaare gaye hai usase yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki is baar varanasi kaa chunaav charchaa se baahar ho gaya he
 In a way, opposition parties have given a walkover to Narendra Modi
 pichley chunaav kaa labboluab bataata he ki narendra modi 2014 main ek khaas ranneeti ke tahat varanasi gaye the
 They also succeeded in their cause
 is baar bhi aisa hi he
 Initially it seemed that the opposition parties would field a common candidate to surround Modi, but this could not happen
 iske sanket pehle se hi milane shuru ho gaye the kyonki varanasi se vipakshi ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa main deree ne is sambhaavna ko puraa bal de diya
 There was talk of Priyanka Gandhi's candidature from the Congress side
 logon main utsukata badi thi lekin pehle shalini yadav or phir ajay raay kii ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi varanasi seat ko lekar logon kii utsukata khatm ho gai
 The loss for the Congress was that Priyanka Gandhi did not contest the election at the moment and Ajay Rai's candidature did not give the Congress a chance to prepare much
 itnaa jarur he ki congress ne ajay raay kii jagah varanasi main koi majboot pratyaashee diya hota to ladaai dilachasp hoti or aasapaas kii siton par bhi iskaa prabhaav dikhataa par aisa nahin ho sakaa

 jimi sherginsal mengulzaarke sahaayak bananaa chaahate the, lekin unke andar ke kalakaar ko dekhakar gulzaar ne unhen 'maachis' main abhinay kaa mauka diya tha
 Jimmy had told that after meeting Gulzar he had asked me to shave because it was a demand for the role
 haalanki shuruyaat main jimi ko is par yakeen bhi nahin hua tha kyonki unhone iske bare main bilkul bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Gulzar had given Jimmy a special gift from Jimmy Shergill, that during the shooting of the match film, director Gulzar was very impressed with my performance
 iske liye unhone khush hokar mujhe do orange candi di thi
 He said that i was completely new in the industry at that time
 aise main us toffee kaa milanaa mere liye badi baat thi

 48-year-old Jimmy has played 23 years of his career and has produced more than 70 Hindi films, 14 Punjabi films and 4 Punjabi films

 '' a statement by Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has created a huge uproar
 unke bayaan par somvaar ko sangh ne palatwaar kiya he
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav has said that Shinde has become a favorite of terrorists with such statements
 ram madhav ne twit kar kaha he ki unhen aisi jaankaree mili he ki aatanki sanghathan scindia ko is bayaan ke liye badhai de rahe hai
 He said that Home Minister Shinde is helping nothing but enemies by making such irresponsible statements
 ram madhav ne bataaya ki ki lashkar-e-taiyyaba ne scindia ko aise bayaan ke liye badhai di he
 Significantly, on Sunday, Shinde claimed that he was getting such reports that Hindu terrorism is being promoted in RSS and BJP campos
 grahamantri ne maalegaanv blast, samjhauta express blast or hyderabad ke makka masjid blast kaa hawala dete hue kaha tha ki in sabhi dhamaakon main hindu kattarpathiyon kaa haath tha, jinhen sangh or bijepi ne training di thi

 The second season is ready and is expected to be streamed by the end of August
 pradhanmantri narendra modi jab pichley saal chunaav ladane banaras aae the to dashakon se badahaali ke shikaar shahar ke logon main ek nai ummid jaagi thi
 Modi Ji also announced several plans for the development of Benaras, but this is now a year old, and all his plans are closed in the pit
 kisi bhi yojana par koi bhi kaam shuru nahin ho paaya he
 Among these projects, one has been described as an ambitious project of the Prime Minister, which was for the weavers
 iske tahat unhen ek hi chat ke neeche na sirf training di jaaegi, balki unhen bazaar uplabdh karaane ke saath-saath unki har mushkil ko aasaan karne ke raste bhi bataae jaaenge
 On November 7 last year, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of this trade-facilitated center costing around Rs 200 crore and said that the scheme will change the fate of the weavers
 lekin aaj saat maheene guzar chuke hai, or yahaan eent rakhana to dur, abhi jameen ke hastantaran kaa vivaad hi nahin sulajhaa he
 Textiles Minister Santosh Gangwar himself says, "this project will be completed in a quarter to two years
 
 
 banaras vikaas praadhikaran se isaki anumati abhi nahin mili he, or jaise hi anumati milegi, kaam shuru ho jayega
 
 
 We cannot start the work without permission, but we feel that permission should be given in a month and a half
 
 
 " After the foundation stone and the announcement, this is not the only plan waiting for the beginning
 aisi kai or bhi yojanaayen hai, jinamein pramukh he banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main 600 karod rupee kii laagat vaali teachers training centre banane kii yojana, jiskaa shilanyas bhi pradhanmantri ne hi kiya tha
 Other similar schemes are - Rs 500 crore Diesel Rail Engine Expansion Scheme, Rs 250 crore Banaras Cantt Railway Station Remodeling Scheme, with 36 lakhs from Parliament Fund alone, 900 crore underground cable scheme
 isi prakaar varanasi ke heritage swaroop ko bachaae rakhane ke liye 90 karod kii hriday yojana tathaa shahar ke ghaaton par vaai-faai kii suvidha dene or safai karwaane kii yojana bhi philhal shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he, or is bich kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18,000 karod rupee kii nai yojanaon kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 He told the activists, "the central government is paying Rs 18,000 crore from various departments to develop Varanasi and the surrounding areas, including schemes related to issues like roads, electricity, irrigation, education, water
 
 
 ye sabhi yojanaayen puri ho jaaengi, to banaras kii rup-rekha badal jaaegi
 
 
 " jab puraane vaade hi ab tak zamin par dikhaai nahin de rahe hai, so, venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane utsahit nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The government also knows that the public will ask for accounts for this one year, so from May 26, the government is preparing the workers to give details of their work to the public
 pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main venkaiya naidu ne party kaaryakartaaon se ghar-ghar jaakar janata ko vikaas kii yojanaon ke bare main jaankaree dene kii taakid di
 The comments vaise, dar yah bhi he ki janata jab puraane vaadon kaa hisaab maangegi, to kahin kaaryakarta un sawaalon se niraash na ho jaaen
 
 
 So their morale is being boosted by saying, "people are saying, it's been nine months
 
 
 are, nau maheene main to baccha paidaa hota he, lekin kya vah paidaa hote hi daudane lagata he
 
 
 Still see, the government is running
 
 
 isliye aap sab log ghar-ghar jaaen, or sarkaar kii ab tak kii uplabdhiyaan bataaen
 
 
 " lekin jis tarah ek saal hone ke baad bhi vaadon ko puraa karne kii disha main koi jumbeish zamin par dikhaai nahin de rahi he, usase banaras ke logon ko lagane laga he ki vikaas ke saare vaade yahaan kii oobad-khabad or dhul bhari sadakon par kahin kho gaye hai, jinhen dhundhakar laana vaada karne vaale mantriyon ke bas kii bhi baat nahin he
 Perhaps that's why the people of Benaras, who have been suffering for decades, are still unable to see the Prime Minister's dream of Banaras
 in pariyojnaon main ek ko pradhanmantri kii mahatvakankshi pariyojna bataaya jaataa rahaa he, jo bunakaron ke liye thi
 Under this, they will not only be trained under one roof, but they will also be given ways to make the market easier as well as to ease their problems
 takreeban 200 karod rupee kii laagat vaale is trade-fecilated centre kaa shilanyas pichley saal 7 november ko pradhanmantri ne bade jor-shor ke saath kiya tha or kaha tha ki yah yojana bunakaron kii takadir badal degi
 But today, seven months have passed, and far from keeping the brick here, the dispute of transfer of land has not yet been resolved
 khud kapadaa mantri santosh gangavar kehete hai, "yah project sava do saal main puraa hoga
 
 
 The Banaras Development Authority is yet to get its permission, and work will start as soon as permission is granted
 
 
 ham bina anumati kaam shuru nahin kar sakate, lekin hamen lagata he ki ek-dedh maheene main anumati mil jaani chahie
 
 
 " shilanyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat kii intazaar main sirf yahi akeli yojana nahin he
 There are many other such schemes, prominent among which is the plan to build a teachers training center worth Rs 600 crore in Banaras Hindu University, which was also laid by the Prime Minister
 isi tarah kii anya yojanaayen hai - 500 karod rupee kii deazal rail ingine vistarikaran yojana, 250 karod kii banaras kaint railway stesan kii remodeling kii yojana, jisamen sirf sansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai, 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 Similarly, to save the heritage form of Varanasi, a 90 crore Hriday scheme and a plan to provide wi-fi facilities and cleanliness at the ghats of the city are also waiting for the beginning, and meanwhile Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has 18,000 Shown dreams of new schemes worth crores of rupees

 Earlier, while addressing the session of Parliament, Imran Khan spoke against India and called this decision against the Kashmiris
 jab imran khan bayaan de rahe the, tab bhi vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya or sarkaar kaa virodh kiya
 In fact, the opposition leaders have accused the Imran government of why they were not aware of such a big action of India
 haalanki, bharat kii ore se imran ke bayaan par koi tippanee nahin kii gai thi
 On the one hand, Pakistan is making such rhetoric, on the other hand its army has started violating the ceasefire on the border, although at this place also it is getting a befitting reply

 For the first time since the Mumbai attacks, the Lashkar hideouts are being raided

 According to the rules, the status of protection of a war prisoner is applicable only in international armed conflicts
 sandhi ke mutabik, yuddh bandi vah hote hai jo sangharsh ke dauraan aamtaur par kisi ek paksh ke sashastr balon ke sadsy hote hai jinhen pratidwandvi paksh apni hiraasat main le letaa he
 It says that pows cannot be prosecuted for their direct involvement in war work

 During the hearing of this case, Attorney General KK Venugopalan had also said before the court - My Lord! The Supreme Court bench has stated that the Chief Justice is the Master of Roster
 lihaaza ab isamen or spashtataa kii zarurat nahin he
 While in the petition, former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan has demanded that the 5 senior most judges should allot the cases together
 etorni general ne maang ko avyavhaarik bataaya tha
 The Supreme Court had asked the AG to help in the case
 court ne venugopal se kaha tha ki jajon kii niyukti kii tarah kya samvedansheel keson ke aavanton ke maamle main CJI kii adhyakshata vaala collegium hona chahie
 The Supreme Court had said that there is no dispute that the CJI is the master of roster
 pratham drushtya hamen ye lagata he ki in house prakriya ko durust kar iskaa hal ho saktaa he, lekin nyaayik tareeke se nahin
 The Supreme Court has to decide how to allocate cases, who should? In the Supreme Court, hundreds of new cases come every day
 aise main collegium ke paanchon jaj ye tay karenge to nyaayik kaamkaaj kaise hoga? ye tarika vyavhaarik nahin lagata
 The job of the judges is not just to give justice but also to safeguard democracy and the Constitution and uphold the rule of law
 shantibhushan kii isyachikaaki sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne chaar jajon kii press conference par kuch bhi sunne yaa bolne se saaf inkaar kar diya tha
 The court had said that it would not talk about it, the Supreme Court said that who will decide which case is sensitive? Someone may be case sensitive for someone else
 vahiin, yachikakarta kii or se dushyant dave or kapil sibbal ne kaha ki chif justise master of roster hai ye wo bhi maanate hai
 Petitions usually go directly to the judges by registry
 sirf samvedansheel maamalon ko hi registry chif justise ke paas samuchit bench ke liye puuchhati he
 Sibal had argued that we have mentioned 14 cases in the petition, including the cases of Judge Loya and Asthana
 isliye aise samvedansheel maamalon main keson ke aavanton ke liye collegium ko tay karnaa chahie
 No single person can be given a monopoly in a constitutional manner
 ye desh kii sabase badi adaalat he jise loktantr or samvidhan kii raksha kerani he
 Four senior judges of the country's largest court went public through the media on the issue of system

 The government also said that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, the government has the right to send the recommendations of the collegium back with its objections for reconsideration
 sarkaar usee adhikaar kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 At the same time, suggestions have also been sent to the Collegium that there is not a single justice representing SC and ST in the Supreme Court
 kyon naa colegium is bare main bhi vichaar karen
 But now it is certain that if the collegium again sends the recommendation of Justice Joseph's name to the government, then the matter will be stuck
