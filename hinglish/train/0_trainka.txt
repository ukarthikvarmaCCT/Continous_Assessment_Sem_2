 
 This nearly three-minute video is actually CCTV footage, in which a thief is seen trying to enter a house in broad daylight and steal a motorcycle
 
 
 koshish isliye, kyonki vah 'darvaaze' main hi funskar rah gaya, or phir jab ghar ke bheetar se niklaa ek shaks uski ore dauda, to chor ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 
 
 This video is three years old, it is also known due to the timestamp on this CCTV footage, but apart from this, where and when this incident happened, it is not known
 
 
 video main saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki chor pehle ghar ke lohe ke darvaaze ke baahar dubkkar baithta he, or phir mauka paakar daravaaza sarkaakar bheetar ghus aata he, or puri kamyaabi se motorcycle ko ghasitkar darvaaze tak le bhi aata he
 
 
 Just by reaching here, luck leaves him, and something happens that he would not have even dreamed
 
 
 video ko dekhte-dekhte jahaan aapako lagane lagata he ki ab yah motorcycle chori ho hi jaaegi, tabhi motorcycle darvaaze main funs jaati he, or chor kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood nikal nahin paati
 
 
 Meanwhile, a man comes out from inside the house, and runs towards the thief with a shovel, after which the thief has no way but to escape from his life
 
 
 tippaniyan The video is interesting, no doubt, but it's hard to understand why this video was posted three years later, and why it's trending
 
 
 baharhaal, in sab sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil paaen, to bhi iske mazedaar hone main koi kami nahin aati, so, aap log bhi dekhie, or coment likhakar hamen bataaie, yah naakaam chori aapako kisi lagi

 It is clearly visible in the video that the thief first sits down outside the iron door of the house, and then, by chance, sneaks in and enters, and successfully drags the motorcycle to the door
 
 
 bas, yaheen pahunchakar kismat uskaa saath chhod detii he, or kuch aisa ho jaataa he, jo usne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 
 
 While watching the video, where you feel that this motorcycle will be stolen, then the motorcycle gets stuck in the door, and despite millions of efforts of the thief, it does not come out
 
 
 isi dauraan ghar ke bheetar se ek shaks nikalakar baahar aata he, or belcha lekar chor kii taraf daudta he, jiske baad jaan bachaakar bhaagane ke alaava chor ke paas koi rasta nahin rah jaataa
 
 
 The comments video dilachasp he, isamen koi shaq nahin, lekin yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki yah video teen saal baad kyon post kiya gaya, or yah kyon trend kar rahaa he
 
 
 However, if you do not get the answers to all these questions, then there is no harm in its fun, so look at you guys too, and tell us by writing a comment, how did you find this failed theft

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi began campaigning on Monday from the land of Kutch
 is dauraan unhone ek baar phir congress or rahul gandhi par tikhi tippanee kii
 Here PM Modi is addressing the fourth rally in Kamrej
 pradhanmantri ne bhuj main vishaal jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue gujarat ke vikaas se jude aaropon par congress ko jawaab diya
 During this, he said, 'development is our mantra and the public will not forgive those who make fun of development
 ' unhone bataaya ki kuccha main ek taraf registan he to duusari taraf pakistan, kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki yahaan par kheti bhi ho sakati he
 Modi said that Congress never took Gujarat into consideration, it has been happening since the time of Sardar Patel
 isliye congress ko gujarat kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 On this statement of PM Modi, the Congress in-charge of Congress has retaliated
 congress netaa ashok gahalot ne ulta ye kah daalaa ki piem narendra modi ko desh maaf nahin karegaa
 Gehlot said, 'modi ji only gives lighted speeches, fluffy speeches do not fill the stomach of the people and the people of Gujarat have understood this
 ' ashok gahalot ne kaha ki modi ji keval jumala or lachchhedaar bhaashan karte hai, isliye gujarat or desh kii janata unako kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 In fact, the Congress has made the development of Gujarat an election campaign
 yahaan tak ki congress ne gujarat main 'vikaas pagalaa gaya he' naare kaa bhi jamkar istemaal kiya
 However, when PM Modi used the words 'I am development, i am Gujarat' under the new BJP slogan, Rahul Gandhi stopped the development of Vikas Pagla Gaya Hai
 chaay par bhi bole modibhuj ke baad rajkot main piem modi ne chaay ko lekar bhi congress ko gheraa

 i am Modi, i will sell tea but not the country
 'shaam ko piem modi kamrej main chauthi raily ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Addressing the people here, he said that the people of Gujarat are not going to accept the Congress' ego-filled anti-gujarat mentality
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main youth congress ke twitor acount se chaay bechney ko lekar modi par coment kiya gaya tha
 There was a lot of controversy
 haalanki, baad main ye twit delit kar diya gaya tha

 Vicky Kaushal was asked if he had any idea about whether he too was in the list of National Award winners? So in response Vicky said that he had no idea at all
 un dinon vah bilkul relax hokar apni agali filmon ke liye screen test de rahe the
 Vicky Kaushal was talking with Sushant in the session "the Art and the Man: What Give Me Josh in Bollywood"
 unhone bataaya ki unhen yaad he ki wo us live conference ko dekh rahe the jab neshnal awords kii ghoshnaa kii ja rahi thi
 He told that Uri had won three more National Awards before he was named
 uri ke liye kiye jane vaale har nae aword kii ghoshnaa ke saath vah khushi se uchhalane lagate the

 He reported that a prostatic was applied to his entire face, head and ears

 " iske baad unhone apane ko-vinar ayushmaan or karibiyon ko phone kol kiya or badhaaiyaan dekar main vahiin baitha rahaa
 Recalling his debut, Vicky said that he knew that no one was ready to launch him
 lekin maa kii baat yaad thi ki khud par yakeen rakho
 He said that when he came into the industry, he was ready for everything
 unhone kaha ki vah jab is sab main utre the to unhone ek ke baad ek kai intervyuu die the
 He gave auditions for films, documentaries, web series and all, and one day while he was sitting exhausted, his mother explained to him that he should start looking at everything with a positive attitude and assume that everything will happen
 jis kashmir kaa daura karne ke liye videshi patrakaron ko anumati nahin di gai, dilli sthit rajanyikon ne kashmir jane kii anumati maangi to sarkaar ne manaa kar diya, america ke congressman kris won holen ko srinagar jane kaa anurodh bharat ne thukraa diya
 Now what happened is that India has allowed 27 mps of European Union to visit Kashmir
 yahi nahin jis daure ko nijee bataaya ja rahaa he, kaha ja rahaa he ki aadhikarik nahin he, hamen yah bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he ki pradhanmantri modi un saansadon ko sambodhit bhi kar rahe hai or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar bhi mil rahe hai
 If the visit is not official, private, then will the opinion of these mps be of any importance, is it not fair that these mps would meet the press of India, face the question and answer to know who they came on? And what questions are Kashmir going to take
 yahi nahin 27 saansad kis dal ke hai, unke dalon kaa apane apane desh main kashmir par kya rukh rahaa he, yah sab spasht nahin he
 The government has not tweeted
 is maamle main koi press relise bhi jari nahin hui he jaisaa ki aam taur par videsh mantralay kii gatividhiyon ke sambandh main hota he
 The Hindu's Suhasini Haider, speaking to the European Union embassy in Delhi, has written in her report that the visit is not official, but a personal visit
 ye saansad italy, britain, france, germany or poland ke bataae jate hai
 But their names and names of parties are not clear

 amareeki sansad main bhi maanavadhikaar kii sab cameti main kashmir ke sawaalon ko lekar charchaa hui thi or bharat kii aalochana kii gai thi
 It is necessary to remind here that the leaders of the Indian political party were prevented from going to Kashmir

 Now the question is arising that the European Union mps who have no details in public, are allowed to go on a private tour, before the visit the Prime Minister meets

 Even Mohammed Alim Sayyid, a student, had to knock the door of the Supreme Court to meet his family

 It rained once again in Delhi and then flooded the streets
 lekin iske liye jimmedaari kaa sawaal aayaa, to phir emsidi or dilli sarkaar ke bich talavaarein khinch gayi
 Every time Delhi is water, the process of throwing mud at each other in the politics also starts, but a letter from the Delhi Police has opened up the Kejriwal government and the MCD has a chance to raise its collar have given
 chitthee main 58 jagahon kaa zikradilli police ke disipi trephic ne tinonemasidi, endiemasi or peedbludico ek chitthee likhakar 11 july ko hui baari barish ke baad 58 aisi jagahon kii suchi bheji thi, jahaan baari jalajmav hua tha
 According to the traffic police, water was accumulating in these 58 places even after the end of the rain and due to this, there was a traffic jam
 dilli police kii ye chitthee or usamen 58 jagahon kii suchi bhi hamaare paas maujuud hai
 All roads are subject to PWD Interestingly, out of these 58 places, there was not a single road of MCD
 sabhi 58 point peedblyoody kii sadakon par the, jo dilli sarkaar ke tahat aati he
 Encouraged by this, the MCD left no stone unturned to take on the Delhi government
 south emsidi main sadan ke netaa subhash aryaa ke mutabikatraphic polisaki report bhi ab dilli sarkaar ke jhooth ko benakaab kar rahi he, kyonki dilli ke mukhyamantri or sarkaar ke mantri aksar jalairao ke liye emsidi ko koste hai, jabaki isaki asal jimmedaari unki he or report bhi kahati he ki peedblyoody kii sadakon par pani bhar rahaa he
 PWD Minister's argument When asked about PWD Minister Satyendra Jain of Delhi Government, his argument was very strange
 satyendra jain ke mutabik is baar agar 58 jagahon par hi pani bharaa he, to ye acchhee baat he kyonki pichley saal 150 se zyada aisi jagah thim, jahaan pani jamaa hua tha or jam laga tha
 But the Minister may not have read the Delhi Police letter properly, because in this letter, the DCP has also informed that out of these 58 places, only 15 are such places, which have been included in the 160 points of the earlier list, whereas More than 40 new places are flooded with rain this time
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki kab agenciyaan sirf bayanon se apana bachaav karti rahengi or log sadakon par jal bharaav se jujhate rahenge

 anant chaturdashi bhakthi, ekta or sauhaard kaa pratik he
 This festival is celebrated with pomp across the country
 ashram chhodane ke baad sushila or kaunidanya ke liye jivan behad kathin ho gaya
 There was no shelter nor means of livelihood
 donon kaam kii talash main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par bhatakane lage
 While wandering, both reached the banks of a river, where they rested at night
 usee dauraan sushila ne dekha ki vahaan kai striyaan saj-dhaj kar puja kar rahi thim or ek-dasure ko raksha sutara baandh rahi hai
 Sushila asked him the importance of fasting
 wo sabhi mahilaayein vishnu ke anant swaroop kii puja kar rahi thim or anant sutara baandh rahi thim
 He explained that the effects of this fast removes all distress and fulfills wishes
 sushila ne vrath kaa vidhi vidhaan se paalan kiya or anant sutara pahanane ke baad bhagwaan vishnu se apane pati ke kashton ko dur karne kii prarthana kii
 Over time, the life of Kaunidanya Rishi started improving
 vrath ke prabhaav se unhen ab dhan-dhaany kii kami nahin thi
 The next year again came the day of Anant Chaturdashi
 sushila ne bhagwaan ko dhanyavad dene ke liye phir se vrath kiya or anant sutara dhaaran kiya
 When Rishi Kaunidanya asked about the thread, Sushila revealed the glory of Anant Chaturdashi
 saath hi kaha ki sara vaibhav is vrath ke prabhaav se mila he
 Upon hearing this, Kaunidanya became enraged
 rishi ko laga ki patni unki mehnat kaa shrey bhagwaan ko de rahi hai or gusse main aakar unhone anant sutara tod diya
 Saddened by this insult, Anant Dev slowly withdrew everything from the sage Kaunidanya
 pati-patni phir se jangal-jangal bhatakane lage
 Then he met the sage who told him that his condition was due to insult to God
 tab rishi kaunidanya ko apane paap kaa abhas hua or unhone patni ke saath milakar puure vidhi-vidhaan se anant chartudashi kaa vrath kiya
 He performed this fast for many years and Anant Dev was happy after 14 years
 bhagwaan ne rishi kaunidanya ko darshan die or unke jivan main phir se khushiyaan laut ain
 It is believed that Lord Krishna narrated the story of Anant Chaturdashi to the Pandavas
 pandavon ne apane vanvaas main har saal is vrath kaa paalan kiya
 It is said that the truthful king Harishchandra was also regained by the influence of this fast

 In the drive, Sushant along with Jacqueline and his group plan a robbery at Rashtrapati Bhavan, while Bowman and Pankaj are trying to nab them
 
 The response of the audience to such an audience trailer is not appealing to most viewers and many people have criticized the VFX of this film

 At the same time there were many who also said that since Karan Johar knew that this film will not be very successful in theaters, he has decided to release the film directly on Netflix

 com dwaara muhaiyaa karai ja rahi yatayaat sevaaon se judi gatividhiyon par pratibandh laga diya he
 At the same time, questions are also being raised on the negligence of the police in this case, because the accused driver has already been convicted in another rape case, despite this, Delhi Police gave him a character certificate this year

 Until then there is no release of the minor convict
 swati kii chitthee main kyaswathi maliwal ne chitthee main kaha he ki dilli mahila ayog shanivaar raat hi supreme court main special live pitishan daakhil kii he
 In this, the minor boy Kirihai is challenged
 supreme court main somvaar ko isaki sunwaayee hogi
 Therefore, this matter is sub-judice
 meri guzarish he ki jab tak supreme court main sunwaayee nahin ho jaati tab tak use reeha na karen
 The Supreme Court had gone in the middle of the night at about quarter past twelve on Saturday night and went to the house of Supreme Court Justice AK Goyal
 vahaan se register ke paas pahunchi
 a vacation bench of Justice Goyal and Justice UU Lalit set the matter for hearing at 2 pm on Monday

 isse pehle sibiai ne ek notice bhejkar baalkrishna ko apane asli dastauez pesh karne ko kaha he
 2 days ago, on 27th, Balkrishna's lawyers claimed to have submitted the requisition documents of CBI
 baalkrishna par farji passport kaa maamla chal rahaa he
 They are accused of hiding many things while making passports
 is maamle main sibiai pichley maheene baalkrishna se poochtacha bhi kar chuki he
 It started with a whisper
 phir se rang main ai australia kii team perth main bhartiya khilaadiyon ko dho rahi thi or team india ek baar phir videshi dharti par chaar shunya se siries haar rahi thi
 The whispering intensified as the day passed and by the end of the tour it turned into a noise
 tolastoy ne likhaa he ki sabhi sukhi parivaar ek hi tarah ke hote hai, lekin har dukhi parivaar ke apane-apane dukh hote hai
 The tour went very poorly for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his family found themselves in a bizarre pathetic state
 maidan par bhi or dressing room main bhi
 Signs of this were already visible
 melbourne main khele gaye pehle test main sab kuch thikthak rahaa
 The bowlers took 20 wickets and each of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag scored more than 50 runs
 is tarah, match paanch din khinchaa
 But after that the scattering started
 sidney main viraat kohli ne jab australian bheed kii taraf unguli se ashleel ishaara kiya or unki nirmamata kaa ronaa royaa to yah bhartiya team main niraashaa kii hi abhivyakti thi
 But this was an external reason
 aam taur par shant rahane vaale eshanth sharma ne din bhar ke khel ke baad jab ek go-cart (chaar pahie kaa chota vaahan) trek par isi tarah ke bhav vyakt kiye to team kii niraashajanak manodasha kii pushti ho gai
 Everything unfolded in Perth
 mukaddar ke sikandar se ruthi kismattim ke saath jane vaale patrakaron or purv khilaadiyon ke bich hui baatcheet se sanket mila ki dressing room main sab kuch thikthak nahin he
 Veteran Australian cricket writer Robert Craddock wrote in the Herald Sun that Virender Sehwag was leading a group of players unhappy with Dhoni's captaincy in the Test series
 sahvaag ke kheme ke khilaadiyon kaa maananaa tha ki dhoni ne ek ke baad ek ghatiya pradarshnon se team ko nicha dikhaaya he
 However, a section of Indian commentators started hinting about this
 har guzarate din ke saath yah or saaf hota gaya ki dressing room main kuch gadabad he
 India played all Test matches in a very disinterested and undisciplined manner
 jab dhoni ko edilade main chauthe test ke liye nilambit kiya gaya to virendra sahvaag ne kaman sanbhali
 But he also proved that his captaincy is neither better than Dhoni nor worse
 ise vidambnaa hi kahenge
 India lost the Adelaide Test and Series 4–0
 yuva khilaadiyon kii team lekar isisi tii-20 kaa pehla vishwa cap jeetne ko lekar charchaa main aane vaale dhoni, captain ke paramparaagat saanche main kabhi feet nahin baithe hai
 However, that victory brought revolution because it was found without senior players
 baahar se dekhne par aisa lagata he ki team main puraane test khilaadiyon ke hone se dhoni bandha-se jate hai
 They have also given such signs
 test maichon ke khatm ho jane ke baad jab dravid or ve

 es
 Laxman left home and the dressing room was full of energy of 50-over fast, furious and young players, so it seemed that Dhoni has come to life
 unhone us siries se pehle kaha tha, ‘van-de said hamaari test said se bahut alag dikhti he
 The new boys coming into the team are more assertive which leads to warmth in the dressing room
 ve ek-duusare kii taang kheenchna pasand karte hai
 This makes the atmosphere of the dressing room more vibrant
 dressing room puri tarah se badal gaya he
 We have left behind Kishore Kumar's songs and moved on to songs by Sian Paul (jamaican Pop and Reggae Artist)
 is tarah kaa badlaav aayaa he
 The dressing room is full of noise
 vahaan alag-alag peedi ke khilaadi hote hai
 'team India all four times, when you hear their thoughts, then you will pray that Tendulkar's ipod does not contain the songs of Kishore
 baharhaal, varisht khilaadiyon kaa abhi or adhik apmaan hona tha
 When he finally got a win against the Australian team, Gautam Gambhir, who won the man of the match, declared that the absence of some special players was good for the Indian team
 unhone patrakaron se kaha, ‘aap bade naam nahin chaahate, aap aise khilaadi chaahate hai jo kuch karke dikhaa saken
 The best team is the one whose all 11 players have confidence that they can beat any opposing team
 or khilne vaale in 11 khilaadiyon ko bharosa tha ki ve is van-de main australia ko haraa sakate hai
 One or two players do not matter
 ’ ve ek yaa do khilaadi koun the? kya ve kishor da ke prashansak the?kya hamen unke naam lene kii jarurat he? yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki tendulkar us van-de main nahin khele the
 As it would have been called on television
 yah kisi ‘bam dhamaake’ se kam nahin tha, gambhir bhi naakhush the
 He also said that two balls were left to win the match
 unhen captain par gussa aa rahaa tha
 If they had just run, they would have won the match already
 yahaan tak ki dhoni ne bhi mana ki sir se pani guzarane tak chizon ko chhod dene kii unki aadat se bhartiya team kaa srilanka ke khilaaf jeeta hua match ti ho gaya
 After the defeat in Brisbane, the Indian team started thudding
 is van-de main bhi over phenkane kii dhimi raftaar ke kaaran dhoni ko nilambit kiya gaya
 In this way, he was suspended twice in the tour
 captain ne kaha ki gambhir, sahvaag or tendulkar jaise khilaadi dhimi gati se fielding karte hai, jiske kaaran bharat ne bahumoolya ran ganvaae
 He said, 'australian or Sri Lankan batsmen will try to take two or three runs when the ball goes to these players
 iskaa matlab he ki hamaare khilaadiyon ke sharir par or adhik dabaav padegaa kyonki thro or diving, donon acchhee honi chahie
 Due to both these things there will be constant pressure on them
 isse hamaari fielding kaaphi prabhavit hogi
 This means that there will be pressure on our batsmen to make those extra 20 runs
 ’sahvaag ne agle match main jab dhoni se phir kaman lee to ek or haar mili
 When this defeat was commented on, Sehwag said about his' classic 'catch,' You saw my catch? We have been fielding this way for the last 10 years
 ’lekin sahvaag ne team main kisi tarah kii foot se inkaar kiya
 He said, 'we are united, happy
 ve (dhoni) captain hai
 They can say whatever they want
 ve media ko sambodhit karte hai or aisa pichley do varshon se karte aa rahe hai
 we are used to
 ’ lekin team india australia main khud hi bataa rahi he ki uske bheetar kitne matbhed hai
 This has rarely been seen before

 Congress national general secretary Digvijay Singh has said that many organizations have been trying to divide the country as a recluse right from the time of Partition, while the fact is that Hindutva has nothing to do with religion

 Digvijay Singh said, "the Congress gave independence to the country after a long struggle and after this independence many political wars took place but religious wars did not take place, while the Christian community and Islamic religious people came to India and left

 is avan main dhaatu ko bhi galaa dene kii kshamta thi
 Officials said that after burning Khashogi's body, meat was also cooked in this oven so that old evidence could be erased
 turki ke jaanch adhikariyon ne paaya ki khashogi ke khun ke chhinte saudi counsal ke daftar main deevaaron par mili hai
 After the murder of Khashogi, these walls were repainted
 al jajira ne ye documentry suraksha adhikariyon, khashogi ke turk doston or netaaon se intervyuu ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya he

 The shock that Shiv Sena got from what happened in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on Wednesday will not be forgotten for a lifetime
 unhone dosti or dushmani donon card khilne kii koshish kii or maat kha gai
 He felt that he is now in his hands, but due to the cleverness shown by the BJP, the parrots of his hands flew
 baharhaal ham jaanane kii koshish karte hai wo 10 vajahen kya thim jinase sena kaa ganit bighad gaya
 1
 shivasena shuru se hi galat card khel rahi thi
 Before the election, she was negotiating with BJP for seats
 uske sakht rukh ne bijepi alaakaman ko yah abhas karvaa diya ki aage chalakar bhi party kaa yahi rukh rahegaa or yah pareshaaniyaan paidaa karti rahegi
 2
 bijepi ne shivasena ke saath milakar chunaav to ladanaa chaha tha lekin tikat bantwaare ke prashn par vah usase dur ho gai
 The Shiv Sena instead of contesting elections in a neutral manner started condemning BJP and even PM Narendra Modi which was unfair
 do raajnneetik dalon main jab matbhed hota he to aapas main sambandh itane kharaab nahin ho jate jitne shivasena ne kiya
 The Shiv Sena supremo spoiled his game by comparing Modi and his supporters to Afzal Khan's army
 3
 Shiv Sena's biggest problem is that it does not have a seasoned politician
 manohar joshi sareekhe puraane raajnneetigyon ko party ne kinare kar diya
 In such a situation, there is no experienced leader to advise him on time
 4
 Uddhav Thackeray always lived in the hope that the BJP would finally accept his words
 vidhansabha main bijepi ke sadasyon kii tulana main unke paas aadhe sadsy the lekin ve upmukhyamantri, grih mantri, vitt mantri sahit das mantri pad maang rahe the jo bahut hi badi maang thi
 5
 shivasena ne aisa koi channel nahin rakhaa jisase unka bijepi alaakaman se sampark bana rahe
 This is a simple matter and such arrangements have always been made
 uddhav thakare ko laga ki matoshri vahi he jahaan bijepi ke sabhi netaa hajiri lagane aate hai
 Here he missed and could not read the time
 6
 After the election he remained adamant while the NCP gave unconditional support to the BJP
 is chaal ko samajhane main ve naakaam rahe or bijepi se tolmol karte rahe
 There are veteran politicians in Maharashtra Congress and NCP, in front of which Uddhav stands nowhere
 7
 When the Legislative Assembly speaker was being elected, the Shiv Sena manager could not play the cards in the manner and after that when the BJP leader Ashish Sheller made a motion of confidence, his leaders could not resist him with full force
 unhen mat vibhaajan kii maang kerani chahie thi
 As long as they understood something, the speaker announced a vote of confidence to the government on the basis of yes
 8
 Most of the army mlas remained confused in the House
 unhen samaj main nahin aayaa ki ve aisi haalat main kya karen
 He lacked a leader
 9
 The Shiv Sena always hoped that the BJP would bow down to the vote of confidence and accept them
 isliye party anaavashyak bahaduree dikhaati rahi
 10
 uddhav thakare koi bhi faisla lene main samay lete hai or turant faisla nahin kar pate hai
 Apart from this, he was also not present in the House
 isse party kaa sara khel bighad gaya
 The party mlas could not understand how much the BJP should be opposed
 ab to yah dekhnaa he ki uddhav thakare endie se alag hote hai yaa nahin? party ke liye aane vaala samay kathin he
 If he separates from the NDA, then there will be a danger of his party breaking up
 jab bala sahib ke jamaane main party ke kai bade netaa unka daaman chhodkar duusari ore chale gaye to ab kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Party MP Abu Azmi is upset with Samajwadi Party
 abu azmi ne kaha he ki faijabad main dange ke dauraan samaajawaadee party ne sahi tareeke se kaam nahin kiya

 abu azmi ne kaha he ki samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar hone ke baavjood upi main alpsankhyakon ke saath insaaf nahin ho rahaa he
 Abu Azmi has also made many demands from Akhilesh Yadav

 The stalemate in the Lok Sabha over the last few days over the conduct of caste-based census came to an end today with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's assurance that the cabinet will take a decision soon
 pradhanmantri ke is aashwaasan kaa sabhi dalon ke netaaon ne swaagat karte hue unka aabhaar prakat kiya
 Earlier in the House, the opposition members, who were dissatisfied with the reply of Home Minister p Chidambaram over the two-day discussion on the issue, created an uproar, forcing the House to adjourn the meeting till 2
30 pm
 baithak sthagit hone par sadan main hi sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav, jad you netaa sharad yadav, rajd netaa lalu prasad or bhaajapa ke up netaa gopinath munde sahit kai sadsy pradhanmantri, netaa sadan pranav mukherjee or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke paas jaakar der tak baat karte dekhe gayi
 As soon as the House resumed at half past two, the Prime Minister assured that i want to assure the House that the Cabinet will take a decision on this issue soon
 unke is aashwaasan kaa puure sadan ne megen thapthapaakar joardaar swaagat kiya
 On Manmohan's assurance, Lalu said that the entire House has faith in you and after this assurance, we have stopped our agitation
 lalu kii baat kaa mulaayam ne samarthan kiya or pradhanmantri tathaa sonia kaa dhanyavad kiya
 JD-U chief Sharad Yadav said that this demand had been going on for the last sixty years and the government has shown great heart
 munde ne pradhanmantri ke aashwaasan par unka abhinandan kiya jabaki samprag kii pramukh sahyogi trinmul congress ke netaa sudeep bandopadhyaay ne kaha ki chidambaram ke bayaan ke baad sonia ne jab mulaayam or lalu se alag se baat kii, tabhi lag gaya tha ki faisla ho jayega
 Sonia smiled at him and looked at Pranav sitting next to him
 dramuk ke tii aar baaluu ne kaha ki jati aadhaarit janaganana karaane kaa faisla bahut ahm he
 cpi's Gurudas Dasgupta and cpi's Ramchandra Dome also welcomed the Prime Minister's assurances
 dasgupta ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki sarkaar sadasyon kii bhaawanaaon ke prati jaagruk hui he
 This is a good sign, but in other cases also the government should adopt the same attitude

 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari rejected suggestions that such a situation would not have arisen if the bill related to amendment of the Land Acquisition Act had not been pending in Parliament and the relief and rehabilitation policy had been approved
 unhone samprag sarkaar se anurodh kiya ki ye donon mahatvapurn vidheyak paas ho jaayen
 Tiwari rejected the claim that it could not pass due to opposition from Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee
 tiwari ne kaha, ‘pashchimi uttar pradesh main noida ke aasapaas jis tarah se kisaanon par julm dhaaye gayi, congress uski kade shabdon main ninda karti he
 He said, 'whatever the reason may be, whatever the intention may be, the Chief Minister of the BSP Government has tried to instill a new tradition of development with the help of lathi bullet
 iske parinaam bahut doorgaami honge
 'tiwari said,' Our demand is that there should be a high level judicial inquiry into the atrocities against the farmers and the farmers suffering should be given appropriate compensation
 saath hi rajya sarkaar ko kisaanon ke saath turant baat kar koi na na koi rasta nikaalnaa chahie
 The Congress spokesperson said, "it is true that the Bill to amend the Land Acquisition Act was passed from the previous Lok Sabha but due to dissolution of the Fourteenth Lok Sabha, it could not be made a law
" ’tiwari ne kaha ki chaahe singoor ho nandigram ho yaa desh kaa koi or hissaa, jab tak sthaneey logon ko vikaas main bhagidaar nahin banaaya jaataa, vikaas kii gaadi ko aage nahin badhaaya ja saktaa
 He said that the government should bring this bill before the Parliament as soon as possible and amend it by re-forming the opinion on this law
 congress pravaktaa ne saath hi kaha, ‘lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki loktantric sarkarein lathi goli ke madhyam se logon se baat karen
 "he said," It does not mean that torture and oppression should be done under the guise of it
 koi kanoon aisi barbarta kii ijaajat nahin detaa he
 Tiwari said in response to a question, 'no problem should be over-simplified
 ham sarkari mulajim ko bandhak banane ke haq main bilkul nahin hai
 We do not support such action of violence
 lekin jarurat he samvedansheeltaa kii or logon se baatcheet karne kii
 Earlier, party general secretary and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs Digvijay Singh alleged that Mayawati government is completely insensitive to the question of farmers
 unhone kaha, ‘kisaanon se baatcheet karne or unhen vishwaas main lene kii bajaay yah sarkaar andolnarat kisaanon ke khilaaf hinsak karrwai kar rahi he
 We demand a judicial inquiry into it
 ’ unhone is ghatana kii ninda karte hue kaha ki rajya sarkaar kisaanon se unki jameen chin kar bade audyogic ghaaraanon ko de rahi he

 Attorney Gary S
 Shaprio told a Chicago court on Tuesday that the accused in the Mumbai attack (26 / 11) also agreed to cooperate with the government in the US and any foreign judicial process through video conferencing or production
 shapriyo ne hedli ke pratyrpan se inkaar kiya he kyonki pakistan mul kaa yah america naagarik america sarkaar ke samaksh apana gunaah kabool kar chukaa he or usne america sarkaar ko sahyog dene ke saath america jaanch agenciyon ko vibhinn aatankwaad sanghathanon ke bare main ahm suchanaaen deen
 Shaprio said in the 20-page document, 'as the court is aware, Headley's testimony also helped to convict Tahawwur Rana
 iske alaava, hedli is baat par bhi sahamat ho gaya ki yadi use america atarni karyaalay dwaara bulaayaa jaataa he to america main yahaan tak ki desh ke baahar kisi bhi nyaayik kaarywahi main peshi, video conferencing yaa anugrah patr ke madhyam se apni gavaahi dene ko taiyaar he
 'the United States has requested to sentence lashkar-e-taiba to us-born terrorist David Headley for 30 to 35 years in prison for his role in the Mumbai attack and other terrorist activities
 atarni general gairi es shapriyo ne america sarkaar kii sthiti ko bataane vaale 20 prishth ke dastavej main kaha ki sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki tathyon ko dhyaan main rakhte huye hedli ke liye 30 se 35 saal kaid kii sajaa thik rahegi
 Shapriyo said, "there is no question that his criminal behavior was reprehensible but his decision to cooperate is also very important as it helped the government in its efforts to fight terrorism and in the recommendations of the government
" ’america sarkaar 30 se 35 saal sajaa diye jane kii maang kar rahi he jo uske dwaara tahawwur hossain rana ke maamle main maangi gai sajaa se bahut kam he jise sangheey grand jeuri ne lashkare taiyaba kii sazosaman kii madad or copenhegan main ek denmark ke samachar patr par hamale kii sajeesh rachane kaa doshi qaraar diya he
 Last week, the court sentenced Rana to 14 years in prison and five years in prison on release later
 america sarkaar ne kaha, ‘hedli ne ek bheeshan aatankwaadi hamale kii yojana banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He said that about 164 men, women and children were killed and many people were injured in Headley's reconnaissance in India
 shapriyo ne kaha, ‘nanvabar 2008 main mumbai main itane logon ke maare or vinaash ke baavjood hedli ne do maheene se kam samay baad denmark kaa daura kiya taaki vahaan ek or aatankwaadi hamale kii yojana banane ke liye toh lee ja sake
 Shapriyo said, 'headley worked under the direction of not only the lashkar-e-taiba but also the members of Al Qaeda
 ’america atarni ne kaha, ‘is baat main koi shaq nahin ki hedli ke behad gambhir aparaadh ke liye aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa uchit rahegi lekin is cheez ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chaiye ki usne jaanch main kaaphi sahyog kiya
 'meanwhile, the US government has said that the information provided by Headley after his arrest was very important for the government and its allies, especially India, in dealing with terrorism internationally
 shapriyo ne kaha, ‘hedli ne vyaktiyon, dhaanchon, tareekon, kshamtaaon or lashkar kii yojanaon ke vishay main bataaya tathaa anya aatankwaadiyon ke bare main aage kii jaanch main sakriy hokar madad kii
 Headley's cooperation helped the government file criminal charges against at least seven other individuals and his statement helped convict another co-defendant
 ’unhone kaha ki hedli ne videshi adhikariyon kii jaanch main sahyog kiya or puure saat din tak bhartiya adhikariyon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab diya tathaa sarkaar ko aashaa he ki vah bhavishya main madad karegaa
 Shapriyo said that in view of this, the government will request the court that the sentence of life imprisonment should be reduced to less
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki 30 se 35 saal kii sajaa diya janaa uske ghrunit aparaadh kii pravriti or uske mahatvapurn sahyog ke bich ek uchit santulan hoga

 What was Rahul Gandhi's speech about after becoming Congress vice president? Rahul's speech consisted of about 4000 words including Hindi and English, but in the entire speech, 10 words were such that Rahul used many times
 agar ham in 10 shabdon par gaur karen to asal bharat ko samajhnaa, aam aadmi kii aawaaj sunanaa, satta kaa hastatanran or deele ravaiye kaa khaatmaa, rahul ke bhaashan ke mukhya bindu the
 In this speech Rahul Gandhi said, 'previously i was in-charge and party general secretary of Youth Congress and NSUI
 ab main congress party kaa upaadhyaksh hum
 You should not feel that Rahul only talks about youth
 rahul ke parivaar main ab sabhi yani congress, yuva congress or mahila congress hai
 From today Rahul Gandhi will work for everyone
 main vaayada karnaa chahta hum ki main aapke saath samanta kaa vyavhaar karuunga chaahe vah yuva netaa hon, anbhavi netaa hon yaa mahilaayein hon
 i will listen to everyone

 In this episode, whatsapp introduced a new feature 'blue Ticks' for its users
 lekin lagata he ab whatsapp apane yugers kii privesi ko lekar chintit he
 Therefore, soon the company is going to make the new feature 'blue Ticks' optional
 nae apadet ke baad ab massej bhejne vaale yujar ko nae feechar ‘blue ticks’ ke tahat massej deliver hone ke saath hi padhane kii soochna bhi mil rahi he
 The effect of this is that now you cannot excuse your friends that you have not read the message
 kyonki jaise hi aap maisaj padhate hai, massej par donon tik nile ho jate hai
 The company has now made up its mind to alternate the blue ticks' feature and testing is being done for it
 kai whatsapp yugers kaa kahana he ki jab unhone webisat se sidhe aplicoshan ko downlod kiya to usamen ‘blue ticks’ ko vaikalpik rup main diya gaya he
 This feature is yet to come by default, but users can turn it off by going to settings
 yah thik usee tarah se kaam karata he, jaise whatsapp kaa ‘last seen’ feechar kaam karata he
 The 'last scene' feature can also be discontinued
 ek baar agar aapane ‘blue ticks’ feechar ko band kar diya to na hi aapako read massej dikhegaa or na hi aapako massej bhejne vaale vyakti ko
 Even after reading the message several times, if we want to ignore it, this 'blue ticks' feature interferes with the privacy of the user

 Knowing a lot about these celebrities, there are some things that people want to know
 signechar export or logo diziner maanaklal agarwal in teenon ke dastakhat or swabhaav ke bare main bataa rahe hai
 The signature of Arvind Kejriwal, former Delhi CM and leader of Aam Aadmi Party, shows that he is a very emotional person
 kisi galati ke liye wo khud ko bhi maaf nahin kar sakate hai
 Impressing Kejriwal is also very difficult
 lekin, unki kamajori yah he ki wo aadhi-adhuri taiyaari ke saath hi kuch karnaa shuru kar dete hai or is vajah se kaam ko bich main hi chhodana padataa he
 The signature of bjp's PM candidate and Gujarat CM Narendra Modi shows that he is confident and has a lot of knowledge
 vah koi bhi kaam puri taiyaari ke saath karte hai lekin agar koi unki beijjati karata he to wo ise bhoolatey nahin hai
 The quality of leadership in them is coddled
 congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi ke dastakhat ke mutabik wo ek mehnatee insaan hai or koi bhi kaam behatar planning ke saath karte hai
 But his weakness is that if there is some problem in some work, Rahul leaves it in the middle

 The court clarified that Siva would first have to undergo 10 years of imprisonment for rape, criminal intimidation, wrongful confinement and injury and then begin a 20-year rigorous imprisonment for the offense of gang rape
 shiva ke do anya saathiyon ko giraftaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The court, however, rejected the woman's claim that Shiva abducted her from a train in which she was going to Rae Bareli from Kanpur with her husband and children
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki is baat par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa ki samajhadaar mahila ko is tarah se bheedbhad vaale train ke dibbe main se kaise agava kiya ja saktaa he
 The court also said that the evidence on behalf of the woman indicated that she would have voluntarily gone to Shiva and that it could not be said that she had gone to Shiva to celebrate her recruits

 The Code on Wages provides for uniform enforcement of minimum wages everywhere
 isse har shramik ko puure desh main ek saamaan vetan sunishchit kiya ja sake
 The bill covers all wage-related issues such as equal pay, timely payments and bonuses
 nunatam vetan main aadharbhoot mazdooree, jeevanyaapan kaa kharch or kharch main katautee ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Along with this, the skill of the laborer, labor hard labor and geographical location are also to be assessed
 is aadhaar par centre or rajya sarkarein nunatam mehtaanaa tay karenge
 Till now, the law used to say that only the deadline for giving the required deduction and salary was fixed for the employees who got 24 thousand rupees, all the employees will get this facility under the new law
 is tarah kii gadabadiyon ko rokane ke liye ab inspector sah anudeshak rakhe jaaenge pehle is kaam ko lebar inspector dekhte the
 The parliamentary committee had objected to the removal of the inspector, believing that this would cause problems in implementing the law, so now new instructions are being issued
 is bill main ye bhi praavdhaan he ki iske liye ek yaa ek se zyada adhikari bhi rakhe ja sakate hai taaki vaadon kaa jald se jald or saste main nipataara ho sake
 The jobsender will have the responsibility to prove in cases of reduction of salary, non-payment of bonus and salary deduction
 is bill main aise daawey karne kii avadhi ko bhi (6 maheene se 2 saal tak) badhaakar teen saal kar diya gaya he
 This bill provides that the minimum wage should be increased every five years and technology should be used to pay salaries
 kyon kiye ja rahe hai badlaav?bill pesh karne ke kaarnon ke mutabik iskaa makasad barabari laana or mazdooree kanoonon ko saral karnaa he
 This will create more industry and create employment
 saath hi isse aam mazdooron ko sidhaa laabh milegaa
 The bill is based on the recommendations of the second National Labor Commission
 2018-19 kaa aarthik survey bataata he ki desh ke vetan vyavastha main koun si khamiyaan hai
 Implementation Challenge: The industry has welcomed the government's decision
 siaiai kii udyogic rishton par bani rashtriya cameti ke chairman emes unni krishnan ne kaha he ki nunatam mazdooree kanoon main badlaav se mazdooron kaa shoshan rukegaa
 But state governments should not increase the minimum wage so much that the industry cannot handle it in the face of cheap popularity
 desh ke majdoor union is bill par bante hue hanarees se judaa bhartiya majdoor sangh bmes is bill ko aitihaasik bataa rahaa he, bmes ke adhyaksh sike sajinarayan kehete hai ki is bill se samaaj main kaam karne vaala antim majdoor bhi kanoon ke daayre main aa jayega
 The Left-backed trade union CITU has several objections to this bill
 union ke mahasachiv tapan sen kehete hai 'code on vegej bill' main nunatam mazdooree kaa thos formula (2700 calories pratidin intech par aadhaarit) shaamil nahin he
 This formula was unanimously adopted at the 15th Indian Labor Conference
 sen ne aarope lagaaya ki nae bill ne vyaavhaarik taur par nunatam mazdooree tay karne kaa faisla puri tarah sarkaar or naukarshahi par chhod diya he
 Although the provision of the Tripartite Minimum Wage Advisory Board is placed in the bill, it is designed in such a way that the recommendations of the board will not be binding on the government
 'jevier skool of management ke arthshaastri pro ke aar shyaam sundar kehete hai ki ye bill prabhaavshaalee he, sankethik he lekin isaki vishwasniyata par andeh he kyonki sarkaar ke paas ise lagu karne kaa koi vyapak system nahin he
 The Economic Survey of 2018-19 says that more than one-third of the country's workers are not covered under the Minimum Wages Act of 1948
 ye bill or zyada logon ko nunatam mazdooree kanoon ke daayre main laaegaa isliye ise lagu karnaa or mushkil bharaa kaam he jab aap lebar inspector ke adhikaar gata rahe hai
 They also believe that the government should at least fix wages, it can be adjusted later according to the cost of living

 Without naming anyone, Akhilesh said that i want to know from the female MP that where are you from Unnao? a daughter was raped in Shahjahanpur too, where are you? He criticized the BJP and said that this is the real face of the BJP
 yah kuch din ke liye satta main rah sakate hai, lekin lambey samay tak nahin

 The SP president said that the BJP people call us a goon party
 bataao pradesh ke mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri ke khilaaf kitne mukademe hai
 He said that what can be expected from the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of the state
 akhilesh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhrashtachar ke kaaran sarkaar ne mantrimandal main badlaav kiya
 The central government was also targeted at Akhilesh Yadav, not only the Yogi government, but also the Modi government at the center
 akhilesh ne notebandi ke saath hi dephence coridor ke liye modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii or aarope lagaaya ki notebandi ke baad jaali noton kii sankhya 10 fisadi tak badi he
 He said that with the crooked eye that you are looking at Pakistan, also give us a little Mansarovar
 sapa pramukh ne kaha ki bhagwaan shiv se bada koi nahin he
 He said that the temple also remains
 bhaajapa hamen hindu hone kaa certificate nahin de sakati
 He considers us backward Hindus
 kaha, har ection kaa riection hota hepuri rau main najar aae akhilesh ne modi sarkaar par tanj karte hue kaha ki jo ganga ko dhokhaa de sakate hai, wo kisi ko bhi dhokhaa de sakate hai
 We do not know the science of Delhi, but one thing is known that every action has a reverse reaction
 sarkaar badalane ke liye jail janaa padegapurv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki gurutvkarshan kii ek cheez jaanate hai
 What goes up will come down
 unhone kaha ki jab-jab jail gaye hai, tab-tab sarkaar bani he
 Akhilesh said that if you want to change the government, you will have to go to jail
 unhone kaha ki sarkarein aati-jaati rahati hai
 Officers will come and go, but we will stay here
 dijipi banane ke liye adhikari ne chhue the pairuttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ek adhikari vardi main mere pair chune aayaa tha ki mujhe dijipi banaao
 Later, talking about revealing the name, he claimed that i told him that i am young in age
 aisa mat karo
 Akhilesh said that this government does this
 gauratlab he ki sapa saansad ajam khan ke khilaaf chah darjan se adhik mukademe darj kiye jane ke baad mulaayam singh yadav ne party ke kaaryakartaaon se unke paksh main andolan karne kaa aahvaan kiya tha

 In the absence of Salah, coach Hector Kapar has two good options in the form of Mahmud Tregeguet and Ramadan Sobhi

 5 starjon abraham or sonakshi sinha kii'force 2'us vakt relies hui he, jab darshak ye soch rahe hai ki 1000 or 500 rupee ke puraane band hue note kaise waapas kiye jaaen
 Whether the government is right or wrong, people surrounded by such questions are in no mood to guess how much they are in the mood to watch the film
 iskaa asar film kii opening par jarur padegaa
 Although a good film still draws the audience
 vahiin, pit gai to sara blem note bandi par aa jayega
 The suspense of Kaisa Hai Kahaani is Force 2 'action thriller which has no meaning with the first part' Force 'except that here too John is a police officer without uniform and Sonakshi Sinha is associated with RAW
 china main kis tarah ek-ek kar ro agent maare jate hai or unamem se ek jon yani asipi yashvardhan ke bachapan kaa dost hota he or phir dost kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye jon abraham, sonakshi sinha ke saath budapest jate hai or sajeesh rachane vaale ko pakadaney main kaamyaab hote hai
 After Interval, the sluggish pacefilm debuts with Hollywood action films
 jaraa sa bhi sochane kaa mauka nahin detii
 The tremendous action and location of Budapest seems interesting, but the interval seems to come and go, there is nothing except action in this film
 interval ke baad kya honevaala he, pehle se hi andaja ho jaataa he or saadhaaran climex ke saath film khatm hoti he
 All the stars in the comfort zone like John Abraham acting, lots of action and gossip story are the weak links of this film
 jon abraham ko alag kism kii kahaniyon par dhyaan dena chahie varanaa har film main wo 20-25 gundon ke saath maar dhad karte hi dikh rahe hai
 He has no work except to do a scene without a shirt and defeat Villain at the end
 confort jone kisi bhi kalakaar ke liye acha nahin hota
 Director Abhinav Dev has focused more on technology than story
 ye sab interval tak bardaasht hota he lekin iske baad film bojhil ho jaati he
 This is the second film of Villain Tahir Bhasin and it seems that he is playing his first film 'mardaani'
 unka abhinay bura nahin he lekin aisa kuch nahin kiya jise bahut acha bolaa jaae
 At the same time, Sonakshi Sinha is average
 kaam acha he lekin hollywood kii copy lagati heimare juhaj or mohana krishna kaa camera work laajawab he
 The writings of Pervez Sheikh and Jasmeet Heen dominate the action
 amitabh shukla kii editing acchhee he lekin kul milakar 'force 2' hollywood kii ection pack filmon kii nakal lagati he
 In June next year, the distance between Jammu and Srinagar will be reduced, the path will become easier and shorter even in monsoon and cold weather
 aisa donon rajdhaniyon ko jodne vaali 'aashaa kii surang' kaa kaam puraa ho jane ke baad mumkin ho paaegaa
 The biggest tunnel of the country, excavation at both ends of the chenni-nashri tunnel project is being completed on Monday

 2 kilometers long
 iskaa kaam march 2011 main shuru hua tha is par 2500 karod rupye kharch hue hai
 This tunnel will reduce the distance between Jammu and Srinagar by 30 km
 isse sardi ke mausam main barfbaari or himaskhalan ke kaaran lagane vaale treffic jam ko bhi kam kiya ja sakegaa
 Fans were desperate for an epic reunion for Salman Khan and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Inshallah
 haalanki, kismat ko ye manjuur na tha
