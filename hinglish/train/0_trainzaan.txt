 The company relied on glass and plastic with gradient design to stay in the trend
 is dizine par apgrade karne kii shuruyaat Redmi Note 7 series se hui
 Now the new Redmi 7 also seems inspired by this design language
 aisa nahin he ki Redmi 7 sirf dizine ke lihaaj se badla he
 The company has also upgraded many hardware while retaining the value of affordable price
 shaomi ke launch event main hamane Redmi 7 ke saath kuch vakt bitaayaa
 How did we like this handset at first glance? Let us tell
 
 
 Redmi 7 ko glouci plastic se banaaya gaya he
 This user will not like those who are fond of metallic body
 shaomi ne Redmi 7 ko khubasurat gradient finnish dene ke liye yah samjhauta kiya he
 Xiaomi has named it Aura Smoke Design
 hamaare hisaab se yah puraane redmy phone kii metalik finnish kii tulana main zyada khubasurat lagata he
 Redmi 7 has two gradient color options - Lunar Red and Comet Blue
 ek iklips blike verient bhi he
 According to us, the Lunar Red variant was the most beautiful in appearance
 smocky blike or red gradient nazar khinchataa he
 Redmi 7 is a very compact smartphone
 sahuuliyat kaa dhyaan rakhte hue kinare ghumaavdaar banaae gaye hai
 According to Xiaomi, the device comes with P2I hydrophobic coating
 yani ise pani ke maamuli chhiton se protection he

 phone main 6
 Comes with a 26-inch HD + (720x1520 pixels) display panel, 19
 5:9 aspect reshio ke saath
 It comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection
 is price range main yah feechar dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 We found that the display was vibrant and the viewing angle was also good
 lekin yah indor main thodaa riflactive tha
 We could not use this phone in sunlight
 is phone ko hardware department main bhi apgrade kiya gaya he
 1 for speed and multitasking
 8 gigahertz octa-kor kwalkom snapadragon 632 procesar he
 This handset comes in two RAM options - 2 GB and 3 GB
 storage kaa ek maatr vikalp 32 jibi he
 Both variants have support for up to 512 GB microsd card
 Xiaomi ne is phone main do naino sim ke slot die hai or microesady card ke liye alag slot he
 This means that the user will not have to select one of the other SIM and microsd cards
 is divaais kii bydaree 4,000 eme kii he
 Remember that the old variant Redmi 6 was launched with a 3,000 mah battery
 ab baat camera seoup kii
 Redmi 7 has two rear cameras for photography, a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary sensor
 selfi ke liye 8 megapixl kaa front camera diya gaya he
 Apart from this, this handset is equipped with features like AI Smart Beauty, Selfie Timer and Face Unlock
 hamen phone ke camere kii kshamta aankane ke liye zyaada vakt nahin mila
 We used palm shutter gestures to take selfies, it works
 redmy 7 android 9 pai par aadhaarit miyuai 10 par chalata he
 The limited time we spent with the device found that switching between apps was very smooth
 hamen yuzar interphes main koi dikkat nahin hui
 At a starting price of Rs 7,999, the Redmi 7 seems like a handset worth the money at first glance
 yah redmy 6 kaa kai maamalon main apgrade he
 Looking at the price, it can be said that the Redmi 7 will compete with the Samsung Galaxy M10 (review) and Realme 3 (review)
 kaagazi taur par Redmi 7 ek damdaar vikalp lagata he
 But on this handset, we will give our final decision in a detailed review

 Due to the strictness and challan of traffic police everywhere, people are now walking on the streets, yet on an average 5,000 challans are being cut in the national capital Delhi
 ye aankade nae motor whical act banane ke baad ke hai
 All the challans in Delhi are being done through the court as the Delhi government has not yet issued a notification in this direction
 rajdhani dilli main trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai ho rahi he
 The Delhi Traffic Police says that from 1 to 5 September 2019, the average challan has increased from 4000 to 5000 per day

 Following the amendment in the Motor Vehicle Act, people are now being fined up to 10 times more for violating traffic rules

 Violation of traffic rules is making people very heavy
 ek sitambar ko rashtriya rajdhani dilli main hi police ne 3,900 chaalaan kaate

 Apart from this film, Kangana Ranaut's most awaited film 'thalaivi' is being released by 26th June next year
 iske alaava kangana ranut 'panga' main bhi najar aane vaali hai, jisamen unke saath actress richa chaddha bhi ahm bhoomika main najar aaengi
 Earlier, Kangana Ranaut had also made a lot of headlines with 'manikarnika' and 'judicial Hai Kya'
 in dinon bihar ke vaishali jile main krishna kumaar apane deyari project ke liye mazdooron kii talash main pareshaan hai
 Their complaint is that in the last few years, there are no hard workers in this area
 lekin aisa kyon hua? ve iske liye rajya sarkaar ko doshi maanate hai or kehete hai, “log bahut zyada pine lage hai
 Till 2006, there were only one liquor shop in 16 panchayats in the area, now five shops
 rajya sarkaar ne sharaab kii kharidari aasaan kar di he
 “liquor shops have opened up not only in Vaishali district, but in the entire state
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik, 2002-03 main bihar main sharaab kii dukaanon kii sankhya 3,095 thi jo 2013-14 tak badhkar 5,467 tak pahunch gai
 That is, 2,372 new shops have opened in the last 10 financial years, which shows a shocking average — a new liquor shop is open every other day in Bihar
 sabase zyada sharaab kii dukaane gramin ilaakon main badi hai
 There, their number has increased three times from 779 to 2,360 in 2006-07
 sharaab kii bikri to isse bhi teji se badi he
 The consumption of domestic liquor has increased four-fold while the sale of foreign liquor (IMFL) manufactured in the country has increased five-fold and beer consumption has increased more than 11-fold
 isliye hairat nahin ki bihar ke exise duty (aabkaari rajasav) main bhi 2002-03 ke 248 karod ru
 2,765 crore in 2012-13 to Rs
 kaa oochaal aayaa he
 In this way, excise duty has become an important factor in increasing the state exchequer with a 40 percent annual increase
 bihar ko tex se hone vaali kamai main exise duty kaa hissaa paanch saal pehle 10 fisadi se badhkar 2012-13 main lagbhag 18 fisadi ho gaya
 On the other hand, other items such as sales tax have declined over the same period
 to, yah nayaa rujhaan kya kahata he?rajya sarkaar kii aabkaari niti tab badali jab nitish kumaar ne jedy (you) or bijepi gathbandhan ke mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lee
 The government allowed the opening of additional shops by increasing the license fees for liquor shops to increase revenue
 bihar main audyogikaran kaaphi kam he, uske liye exise duty kaa mahatv haryana jaise baari audyogikaran vaale rajya se alag he
 Alcohol consumption is also very high in Haryana
 bihar kii aabkaari niti par tippanee ke liye rajya aabkaari or sharabbandi vibhaag ke sachiv sandip pundaric or exise kamishnar saiyad parvej alam se phone or email kaa koi jawaab nahin mila
 JD (U) general secretary Shivanand Tiwari admitted that consumption of liquor in the state had increased
 ve kehete hai, “holi jaise tyohaar main log paaramparik bhaang or ganja ke badale sharaab kaa istemaal zyada kar rahe hai
 "but they defend the state's excise policy
" ve bataate hai ki 2005 se pehle sharaab kaa 80 fisadi dhandha tex ke daayre se baahar tha
 He says, "revenue has increased due to organized business of liquor
 ” pichley saal jedy (you) se gathbandhan tuutane ke pehle tak rajya ke up-mukhyamantri rahe bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi isse sahamat hai
 He adds, "revenue increased after 2005 due to systemic changes in the same excise tax structure
 ”ab rajya sarkaar sharaab kii dukaane lottery ke jariye aavantit karti he
 No license is awarded without lottery
 kisi ilaake main do-teen dukaanon ke liye samooh main license diya jaataa he jisamen videshi or desi donon tarah kii sharaab kii bikri jaruri he
 License fees are also considerable
 baxur ke sharaab dukandaar kehete hai ki ve apni do desi sharaab or ek videshi sharaab kii dukaan ke liye har maheene 8
 45 lakhs
 license fees dete hai
 The restaurant owner of Muzaffarnagar, on the condition of anonymity, says that in April 2013, the government paid an annual license fee of Rs 5 lakh for the bar
 se badhaakar 17 lakh ru
 If done, i deferred the plan to open the bar
 ve kehete hai, “restaraan ke liye kai tarah ke tex adaa karne ke alaava main itani bikri nahin badha paaungaa ki itani rakam or adaa kar paaun
 Criticism of liquor is coming to the state exchequer everywhere, but the government has also suffered criticism from social workers and academics
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki sharaab kii bikri badhaane vaale rajasav jutaney ke model se logon kii sehat or mahilaon kii sthiti par asar padataa he kyonki zyaadaatar samaaj ab bhi saamanti pravriti kaa he
 Kumar, the dairy owner of Vaishali, says there is a lack of employment for skilled and semi-skilled youth because of lack of political will, bureaucratic clout and corruption because big or small scale industries have not been established
 ve kehete hai, “isse khaskar gramin yuvakon main niraashaa paidaa ho rahi he
 They do not want to do farming or hard work
 aise anek log gaanv ke prashasan se milakar kalyankari yojanaon kaa paisa uthaa lete hai or use sharaab par lutaa dete hai
 Sanjay Kumar, a social worker from Jehanabad, says that the government 'bailout' is increasing the consumption of alcohol in rural areas
 ve garibi rekha ke neeche ke pariwaron kii misaal dete hai jo har maheene 155 ru
 In 15 kg of rice and 25 kg of wheat is found
 is tarah in pariwaron kaa aadmi 100 yaa 120 ru
 If he is able to work for five to ten days a month on a daily wage, then he blows it on alcohol
 (patna ke ek hotel main aadhi raat ke baad nae saal ke maukey par nashe main thirakate log)rajya kii nai aabkaari niti july, 2007 main lagu kii gai
 The aim was to end the dominance of the liquor mafia and to open more and more liquor shops and thereby provide more opportunities for drinking liquor
 isane desi-videshi daaru ko gram panchayaton main bhi kholane or usee parisar main sharaab pine kii chhot de di
 Now the situation is that in addition to residential areas in the state, liquor shops have also opened near religious and educational institutions
 udaar aabkaari niti se na keval sharaab aasaani se har jagah uplabdh ho gai he balki isaki vajah se dher sari samasyaayein bhi paidaa ho gai hai
 Drunk drunk people create uproar in the street and create law and order problems
 lekin ummid kii ek kiran he
 Last week, the state government assured the Patna High Court that after January 31, educational institutions would not be allowed to open liquor shops
 hycourt ne kaha tha ki agar in jagahon par daaru kii dukaane pai gayi to unhen license dene vaale adhikari ko doshi mana jayega
 Incidentally, the Bihar Excise Act provides that before opening a liquor shop in any area, local people will be informed about it and their consent will be obtained
 isamen un jagahon kii bhi suchi he jinke paas ye dukaane nahin khul saktin, jaise nahaane kaa ghat, shaikshik or dharmik santhaan, aspataal, petrol pump, railway stesan or mazdooron kii basti aadi
 But Bihar has always violated these provisions in the case of licensing of liquor shop in the state
 nai dilli ke think tanks neshnal council of aplide iconomic research (ensieiaar) ke varisht phelo kanhaiya singh kehete hai ki oonche aabkaari shulk or license fees se khaskar desi sharaab ke maamle main milawat or kalabazari bad sakati he
 Shiv Prakash Rai, a social worker from Buxar, says that by increasing the license fees and the price of liquor, the government is trying to make the assumption that this will reduce the consumption of alcohol, but it is also issuing licenses in addition to shops
 ve kehete hai, “hamen is pench ko samajhnaa hoga
 "some experts believe that the revenue from excise should be considered as the money of evil, therefore it is not wrong to increase the tax on liquor
 patna ke asian vikaas research institute ke sadsy sachiv shibal gupta kehete hai, “rajya ko apane rajasav kii jarurat he or aabkaari vah kshetra he jisamen daren badhaai ja sakati hai or rajasav kaa dayera bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 "but some others question the tax system in which excise revenue is increasing the most
 desh ke purv mukhya sankhyakikar pranab sen kaa maananaa he ki kul rajasav main aabkaari shulk main 7 fisadi kii vruddhi kaaphi adhik he
 He says, "it is a matter of concern for any state because both the role and scope of the excise is limited
 ” patna ke e
 N
 sinha institute of soshal studies ke nideshak digambar mishra divakar kehete hai ki bihar main udyog buniyadi sanrachana ke abhaav main nahin lag paa rahe hai, bijli kii kami sabase badi baadha he
 He says, "an atmosphere of trust for industries is not yet being created
 ” sarkari aankade bhi isaki tasdik karte hai
 The State Investment Promotion Board approved 1,441 projects of which only 191 could be set up or any of their units could be set up
 ensieiaar ke kanhaiya singh kehete hai ki aabkaari rajasav baduya aarthik pragati ko nahin darshata
 Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, Dean and Professor of the Social Science Faculty of Patna University, also says, “it is not a positive symbol of progress and is also not sustainable
 asli pragati utpaadan kshetra se aegi jo bihar main nahin ho paa rahaa he
 The latest annual health survey (AHS) conducted under the census program of the Registrar General Office and Population Commissioner of India states that 9 in Bihar
 5 fisadi vayask (15 varsh se upar) sharaab kaa seven karte hai
 9 of these
 8 fisadi gramin aabaadi or 8 fisadi shahari hai
 Its further classification states that 18 out of all the men of the state
 1 fisadi log sharaab kaa seven karte hai, jabaki mahilaon kaa keval 0
 Only 7 per cent consumes alcohol
 in aankadon ke anusaar dekhen to bihar main kareeb ek karod log sharaab pite hai
 Though Nitish cannot match his political mentor Karpoori Thakur, who banned liquor when he was the chief minister in 1977, the current chief minister of Bihar paid Rs 1 lakh to those self-help groups

 The issue of terrorism and the current situation in Afghanistan were also discussed between the two leaders
 meeting ke dauraan parmaanu urja sahyog par bhi baatcheet hui
 During this, Modi's plan to go to America was also discussed
 america se ravaanagi ke vakt se hi un par modi kaa rang chadha hua he
 In Delhi too, he repeated Modi's slogan 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 is tarah ek arase baad america baikfoot par dikhaa he

 This would be because the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recommended to the government to increase the reserve price of spectrum used in 2G services

 It is said that TRAI has said that the reserve price of spectrum used in the 1,800 mhz band should be increased
 isse un companiyon kaa kharch bad jayega jo 2ji sevaayen de rahi hai

 On Diwali of 2012, Ajay Devgan's 'son of Sardar' and Shah Rukh Khan's Jab Tak Hai Jaan had a fight, but in that battle Ajay Devgan was defeated
 beshak donon filmon ne acha bijness kiya tha lekin 'san of sardaar' kamedi kii vajah se zyada surkhiyaan batorne main kaamyaab rahi
 But this time it could not happen to him
 kamjor kahani shandaar ection ke baavjood film ko nahin bachaa saki or ve karan johar kii'i dil he mushkil'ke haathon dharashayi ho gaye
 However, the review and critics' view of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' was not very good
 lekin philhal to'shivaay' kii lutiyaa duubati najar aa rahi haior 'i dil he mushkil' apni kashti ko paar lagaati dikh he
 'shivaay' 70 in the last seven days
 41 karod ru
 While Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has earned 80 in a week
 19 karod ru
 Raised at the box office
 'shivaay' kaa bajet lagbhag 100 karod ru
 If you are told more than Rs, then the budget of 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' is about 70 crores
 hai
 In this way, Diwali was good for Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma, while Ajay Devgan could not show the same kind of fire on his own as he had expected
 vaise is hafte koi badi relies nahin he aise main donon filmon ko thodaa or spes mil saktaa he
 The direct benefit of which is seen in 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 mjedaar yah he ki 'i dil he mushkil' kii safalataa kaa phayda ranbir kapur ko bhi miltaa najar nahin aa rahaa he, kyonki ye film unke akele kii nahin thi
 Ajay Devgan should focus more on his acting than direction and similarly Ranbir Kapoor needs to do something fresh and new to avoid repeating himself

 rashtriya parishad kii baithak main ye ladaai khulkar saamne aa rahi he
 Famous poet and AAP leader Kumar Vishwas is looking a bit isolated in this battle
 aap vidhayak amanatulla khan ko jabase party ne waapas bulaayaa he, tabhi se aisi vishwaas kii naaraazgi ek baar phir ubhar kar ai
 Vishwas said after the suspension of Amanatullah Khanke that he was just a mask, the root is someone else
 to vahiin guuruuvaar ko khabar ai ki jab kumaar vishwaas neshnal council main pahunche to amanatulla khan ke samarthakon ne unki gaadi rokane kii koshish kii aisa hi vishwaas ke samarthakon ne amanatulla khan ke saath kiya
 Earlier, Kumar Vishwas was not mentioned in the list of speakers, but when he reached the program, AAP workers objected to it
 tab jaakar dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne unhen sambodhan ke liye aamantrit kiya, lekin vishwaas ne hi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 Kumar Vishwas did not speak on the stage but, on Twitter, revealed everything from his few lines
 kumaar ne twit kiya, ' khushiyon ke bedard lutero, gam bole to kya hoga
 Those who are afraid of silence, what will happen if 'we' speak
 
 ?? 🤔
 khushiyon ke bedard luteroum bole to kya hogaakhamoshi se darane waalo'ham' bole to kya hoga
 
 ?? 🤔— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas)november 2, 2017yah pehali baar nahin he ki aam aadmi party main is prakaar kii jang chal rahi ho
 Earlier, even when Amanatullah Khan had accused Kumar Vishwas of accusations, Vishwas was also angry
 haalanki, unhen baad main samajha liya gaya tha
 Kumar Vishwas is in charge of Rajasthan Aam Aadmi Party these days
 vah lagaataar jagah-jagah kai chote-chote kaarykram kar rahe hai
 It was under his leadership that he recorded a historic victory in the student election in Rajasthan
 haalanki, sawaal ab ye ho khadaa hota he ki vishwaas ne twit ke jariye to nishaanaa saadh diya ki ham bole to kya hoga
 So whether Kumar Vishwas will speak or give his address now, it will be seen who will be on his target

 If you also live under stress, then it is possible that you have got this disease from your family genes
 ek taaja study ke mutabik, tanaav mol lene kii samasya vanshanugat bhi ho sakati he
 The study has identified chromosomal pairs that increase the risk of stress after difficult situations
 study se saaf he ki pidiyon se mili ye gunasutra ham main maansik avsaad badhaane kii samasya bhi pichhali pidiyon se le aate hai
 Both these chromosomes, which play an important role in brain functions, are known as COMT and TPH-2

 goengian ne kaha ki hamaare shodh ke parinaamon se sanket miltaa he ki jin logon main ye gunasutra maujuud hote hai, unamem maansik avsaad badhane kaa jokhim adhik ho saktaa he
 This study may provide a biological basis for better treatment and diagnosis of people with mental depression
 yuddh, dushkarm yaa prakritik aapadaa jaisi jivan ko hilaa dene vaali ghatnaon ke baad zyaadaatar log is tarah ke maansik avsaad se grast ho jate hai, lekin jaruri nahin he ki tanavagrast sabhi vyaktiyon ko yah samasya ho
 Researchers collected the DNA of 200 people for the study, in order to detect the genetic symptoms of this mental problem
 -input IANS The Dalai Lama rarely gives interviews
 unka zyaadaatar samay himachal pradesh ke macleodganj main apane awaas par bitta he jahaan ve tibet kii nirvasit sarkaar ko anaupchaarik salaah dete rahete hai
 In addition, he lectures around the world and shares his views with the world's most powerful people, including US President Barack Obama
 america main rahane vaala tibeti samudaay unke janm kii 80veen saalagirah manaa rahaa he or uske jashn main jate samay dalai lamas ne senior riter jyoti malhotra se khaas baatcheet kii
 In this conversation, he spoke openly about some important issues that have been under the surface for decades - such as his relations with China, the potential new Dalai Lama and his days in India
 pesh hai saakshaatkaar ke kuch khaas anshalparam paavan, aap ne apane 80 varsh ke jivan ke 56 varsh bharat main bitaye hai
 What does this mean for you? One aspect of my life is that i am a refugee who has lost her motherland
 is bare main mujhe dukh hota he
 However, the relationship between Tibet and India has been very close and special for more than last thousand years
 hamane bharat ko hameshaa apana guru mana he
 i consider myself a disciple of the Nalanda tradition
 isiilie bharat meraa aadhyatmik nivas he
 Especially because of the freedom i have got in India, i have the opportunity to meet many spiritual teachers, scholars and scientists
 kya aap ab bhi khud ko bharat main sharnaarthi maanate hai?nahin, main bharat sarkaar kaa sabase purana mehmaan hum
 Would you like to go back to your home? Want to return to Tibet? Yes, because as a Tibetan, more than 90 percent of the people there trust me
 ve mujhe dekhne ke liye baichaiyn hai or mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki main tibet main buddha dharm kii seva kar paaungaa
 Would you like to reassure the Chinese government that Tibet will not be different from it? Can i say that many officials, especially fundamentalists, cannot see the reality? Throughout their lives, they have been relying on unilateral information provided by Chinese historians
 unhone bataaya he ki saatvin-aathvin sadi ke dauraan teen alag samrajya hua karte the&tibeti, mongolian or chini
 But it became a thing of the past
 maine hameshaa europea sangh or bharat ke paksh ko saraahaa he
 Before the independence of India there were many small princes and kings, but now time has changed
 agar aaj koi raja kahe ki main swatantra hum or samprabhu rajya chahta hum, to yah morrkhtaa hogi
 Similarly, Tibet has historically been an independent nation, but we want to look forward now
 chini ganraajya ke antargat rahanaa hi hamaare hit main he
 Along with this, we should have complete freedom to take care of our culture, our rich Buddhist tradition and environment
 yah hamaare paraspar laabh kii baat he
 Buddhism is increasing in China
 aaj vahaan 40 karod chini buddha hai
 Have you met any of these Chinese Buddhists? Yes, many Buddhist schools come from China, but many of them are afraid of how they will react when they meet Tibetans
 jab ve meri shikshaaon ko sun lete hai to rone tak lagate hai
 Your mediators have held several rounds of talks with China
 isamen kamyaabi hasil kyon nahin hui?china jaanata he ki ham aazaadee nahin maang rahe, na hi algaavvaad hamaara uddeshy he lekin kai kattarpanthi nahin chaahate ki main waapas aauun
 That is why they deliberately spread the belief that the Dalai Lama is a separatist
 kuch chini afasar mujhe shaitan kii tarah dekhte hai
 When i hear such things, i say, yes, i am a devil with horns on his head (laughing)
 kul milakar yah he ki vahaan ke kattarpanthi is dharna ko paalate hai ki dalai lamas samasya khadaa karne vaala aadmi he isliye use dur rakhane kaa unhen puraa adhikaar he
 You have met the father of Chinese President Xi Jinping
 unki maa ek samarpit buddha hai
 Not only he, but many Chinese officials, including the army and Communist Party people who show themselves as atheists from outside, actually believe in Buddhism
 pichley saal shi jinping jab europe or bharat ke daure par gaye the to unhone saarvajanik rup se kaha tha ki buddha dharm chini samskruti kaa hissaa he
 It was quite shocking that a Communist leader from China, whose party had ever declared that every kind of spirituality, especially Buddhism, is backward, the head of the same party today is saying positive things about Buddhism
 shi jinping aaj bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek takreeban asambhav-si jang lard rahe hai
 Two previous presidents, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zhenmin, were also aware of the problem of corruption but were afraid to deal with it
 jinping isse saahas ke saath lard rahe hai or main isaki saraahna karata hum
 Meaning that things are changing in China? Yes
 
 
 jinping ab bhi kaaphi yuva hai
 i am old, but i would like to say that their weight has increased a bit
 unhen varjish kar ke vajan kuch kam karnaa chahie
 i really appreciate his courage and his way of thinking
 unke faislon ko dekhakar lagata he ki ve kaaphi vyaavhaarik hai
 It is different that the entire system is such that it is difficult to get change
 jinping jab pichley saal dilli aae the to atakalein lagaai ja rahi thim ki aap donon kii mulaakaat ho sakati he
 Some of my friends had this opinion, one of them is a Chinese businessman
 main bhi chahta tha ki aisa ho, lekin yah aasaan nahin tha
 Did you want to meet them? Yes, i have always been keen to meet the leaders of China
 ek baar main jab texas main tha, tab hu jintao washington aae the
 At that time also i sent a message that if possible i would like to meet them
 yani aap or shi jinping ke saath milakar tibet kii samasya ko sulajhaa sakate hai?pataa nahin
 Tibet is not directly my responsibility but as i said earlier, all problems can be solved by sitting together
 daman se nahin
 Now almost sixty years have passed when i said that gun worship is done in China
 chairman maao ne khud kaha he ki satta bandook kii nalee se nikalati he
 This type of thinking can only exist during the war
 main jab pehali baar maao or anya adhikariyon se peking main mila tha, tab main vaaki unase bahut prabhavit tha or unka prashansak tha
 They were truly dedicated, serving the public, especially the working class which is the most exploited
 main itnaa prabhavit tha ki maine china kii communist party kaa sadsy banane kii ichha jaahir kar di thi
 As far as socio-economic policy is concerned, i am a Marxist
 yah koi chuphi hui baat nahin he
 i am totally against Leninism which means very strict control
 mujhe ummid he ki china ek khule dimag vaala communist desh banegaa
 The population here is more than one billion, so China can contribute enough in the affairs of the world
 aisa karne ke liye baaki duniya kaa bharosa or sammaan jeetna bahut jaruri he
 a society where everything comes under the purview of state secrecy & it is very harmful in the matter of building trust
 kya aap chahenge ki itane barason se aapaki mejabaan rahi bharat sarkaar china se baatcheet main aapaki madad kare?mujhe lagata he ki na sirf bharat balki samooche swatantra vishwa kii yah jimmedaari he ki vah kisi bhi samudaay kii samasyaon or pidaa ko hal kare
 India's border with Tibet is very long, so the issue of Tibet is an important thing for India
 hamaara rishta vishisht he
 Sometimes i jokingly say that Tibet is India's first line of defense
 yah tab tak aise hi rahegaa jab tak ki tibeti samskruti or aadhyatmikta apni jagah kaayam rahe
 India is our Guru, Tibet is the disciple
 chele ko agar koi dikkat ho to guru kii jimmedaari banati he ki vah use hal kare
 Have you had a close relationship with all the Prime Ministers of India since the era of Jawaharlal Nehru? What is the relationship with Narendra Modi? Have you met him? Yes, Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat when some old remains were found in the state
 ve nalanda jaise dhaanche the jahaan bhikshu rahaa karte the
 At the same time i went to Gujarat and met him
 ve hotel main mere kamare main bhi aae the
 i was very impressed
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi ve kaaphi sakriy hai
 Did you meet once even after he became Prime Minister? Yes, a short meeting
 kya vah vastav main ek choti-si mulaakaat thi?yah gopneey he, isliye behatar he aap unheen se yah puuchhie (hansate hue)
 i do not know, i do not want to go into detail
 kya aap maanate hai ki bharat main ashishnutaa badhati ja rahi he?mujhe nahin lagata
 In Delhi also i was asked a similar question whether Muslims are scared? i said no
 ho saktaa he ki kuch log khuraafaat kar rahe hon, lekin mote taur par bharat main majahabi sadbhaav ab bhi kaayam he
 We have to constantly remind people that this should be maintained
 pichley saal vishwa hindu congress main aresas ke netaa mohan bhagwat kii maujuudagi main aapane kaha tha ki aresas ko mandir par dhyaan dene kii bajaae skool banane par zyada dhyaan dena chahie
 i say the same thing to Buddhist leaders
 ek baar unhone mujhe bolne ke liye bulaayaa jab padmasambhava kii pratimaa lagaai ja rahi thi
 i said that i respect Padmasambhava, but the statue will stand here for the next thousand years but they will not speak
 isiilie hamen kisi pratimaa kii nahin, salaah kii jarurat he
 Worshiping the idol is an old practice
 chaahe ve chini hon, vietnami, burmi yaa srilanka ke buddha, main hameshaa sabhi se yahi kahata hum ki hamen 21veen sadi kaa buddha bananaa hoga jo buddha dharm ke bare main gyanvaan hon
 Recently we went to Dharamshala to see your 80th birthday celebrations, then we saw that the monks were praying for your long life that you live 113 years
 113 hi kyon?maine ek sapane main dekha tha ki main 113 saal jinda rahoonga lekin ab mujhe is par shaq hota he
 i feel tired now
 dharmashala main bhi maine kaha tha ki main pehle 90 or phir 100 saal kaa hone kii kaamana karata hum lekin uske baad mujhe andeh he
 According to the doctors of Taiwan and Tibet who monitor my physical condition, it is very possible that i will live for 100 years
 iskaa matlab ki aap yah tay karenge ki aglaa dalai lamas koun hoga?maine pehle bhi is bare main kaha he ki dalai lamas naam kii sanstha jari rahegi yaa nahin, yah faisla puri tarah tibeti janata kaa hoga
 You won't decide it? i don't worry about the 15th Dalai Lama
 balki kabhi-kabhaar to lagata he ki 15wein dalai lamas kii jitani chintaa mujhe he usase kahin zyada china kii sarkaar ko he
 Sometimes i say in humor and humor that this six hundred tradition should end with the 14th Dalai Lama, which is popular enough
 agar 15waan dalai lamas koi banataa he or vah iske naam ko dhoomil karegaa, to yah bahut bura hoga (hansate hue)
 England spinner Monty Panesar is in the news about a dispute at a nightclub urinating on bouncers there
 ab nai jaankaree ye ai he ki bounsaron par peshaab karne ke baad sharaab ke nashe main dhutt monti panesar bhagkar ek pitja corner main chhipane kii koshish karne lage

 On the question of resuming talks with the Taliban at Bagram Air Field, Trump said "yes"
 unhone kaha, ‘‘taliban samjhauta karnaa chahta he or ham unase milane vaale hai
 When we wanted ceasefire, they did not want ceasefire and now they want ceasefire
 mujhe lagata he ki aise yah safal ho paaegaa
 "the President said that America has made a lot of progress in the last six months and along with that its soldiers are also withdrawing
" afghanistan main america ke sabase bade hawaii kshetra main afghanistan ke raashtrapati ashraf gani ke saath jaldbaaji main yojit dwipaksheeya baithak ke dauraan unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘ ham tab tak vahaan rahenge jab tak kii koi samjhauta nahin ho jaataa yaa hamaari puri tarah jeet nahin ho jaati or ve samjhauta karne ko utsuk hai
 Trump confirmed that he wanted to reduce the number of American troops in Afghanistan to 8,600

 co At present, there is a lot of uproar in the whole country over the rising prices of onions
 lekin vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman (nirmala Sitharaman) ne pyaaj ko lekar sansad main jo bayaan diya, uske baad se soshal media par # onionprice hashtag trend kar rahaa he
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in a laughable tone in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that the rising prices of onions had not affected her personally, as her family did not particularly like things like onions and garlic
 sitaraman ne kaha, 'main bahut zyada pyaaj-lahasun nahin khaati
 
 
 So don't worry
 main aise parivaar se aati hum, jise pyaaj kii koi khaas parvaah nahin he
 'but there are sharp reactions on social media

 Not only this, Tehseen Poonawala has misquoted the statement of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman
 The hon @finminindia says she "does not eat # Onion &she comes from a family that does not eat Onions" 
 Is that why she is not bothered about the rising # onionprice! This is clearly unacceptable and i hope the hon @finminindia smt @nsitharaman ji does regret this statement! pic

 Ponting, a former captain who led Australia to World Cup titles in 2003 and 2007, relinquished the post of captaincy yesterday, five days after the quarterfinal defeat of Cricket Mahakumbh to India
 ponting ne ‘da austrailian’ akhbaar main kalam likhaa ki austrailia ke captain banane se na keval meri jindagi badal gai, isane mujhe mulyon kaa asal mahatv, javabdehi kaa sachcha arth, rashtriya garv kii purajor bhavanaaen or jimmedaari ke bare main sikhaaya

 com / gpolxapujb— ANI (@ani_news)february 28, 2015 After the paid hotel, tighten the screws on the hotels in and around Karol Bagh, it was found that most of the fire fighting equipment that most hotels have installed, most of them do not have maintenance
 vahiin fire ko pataa laga ki zyaadaatar hotel ke paas pani ke storage kii jagah nahin he or gharelu silinder zyada sankhya main hai, lekin unako bhi rakhane ke liye koi vishesh intjaam nahin mili
 The fire at the dedicated hotel not only killed 17 but also made more than one and a half lakh people unemployed
 haadase se sabak lete hue dilli fire vibhaag ne pahadganj hotel mahasang ko taakid kii he ki wo resepshan or sidhiyon par se lakdi ke prayog ko kam se kam kar de yaa phir hataa den
 Delhi Fire Chief GC Mishra assured the hotel businessman that the norms that would be imposed on a 15-room hotel and on 20 which would be checked would be checked accordingly
 hotel mahasang ke jwoint secreti arun gupta ne vishwaas dilaayaa he ki ghatana ke baad se wo ab fire fiting equipments kii technical eemasi Annual Maintenance check karavaaenge, jisase har maheene fire kii chizon kaa mentanence pukhta ho sake
 6 teams of fire are under inspection in Paharganj area
 pahadganj ke baad puri dilli main inspection hoga, jin hotalon kii noc ko suspend kiya gaya he, unako sabhi norms thik karne ke liye kareeb 15 din kaa samay diya gaya he
 Norms states that small hotels should have two fire extinguishers on each floor, larger hotels should have hosiery and pumps as well as exit sign boards, fire alarms, sprinklers, hydrants
 2010 main, nai policy main dilli fire sarvice act ke mutabik hotel, guest house, residential building main aati hai, jin par kamaron kii sankhya ke hisaab se fire ke niyam lagu hote hai,nai policy ke khaas bindu jin par vimarsh chal rahaa hasbase khaas ye he ki baahar nikalne ke liye jeena or ventilation ke pukhta intjaam ho, jisase kisi bhi fire immergency main log iskaa istemaal kar saken
 Some such arrangements are also being made, so that it can be immediately reported as if it was reported after an hour and a half in Arpit
 dilli fire chif ne daawa kiya ki maheene bhar ke bheetar sarkaar fire ke liye nai polisy laa sakati he
 It is also being worked on
 alag-alag samay kii bani hui imaaraton par fire ke intjaam or unke niyam kanoon ko applai karnaa mushkil hota he
 In such a situation, if the entire structure has to be changed to install fire fighting, then it is very difficult, in such a situation, it is being seen how safety can be increased by structural changes
 arun jetali kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main piyush goyal 1 farvari ko modi sarkaar kaa antarim bajet pesh karenge
 It is being said that there will be something special for every section in this budget
 kyonki saamne 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav he
 In fact, during his tenure, the Modi government started many schemes, in which many were successful, but in some schemes, the result was not getting the expected result
 ab vipaksh in yojanaon ko lekar sarkaar par hamalavar he or sarkaar baat karne ke kanni kaat rahi he
 We have brought a list of 5 such schemes for you, on which the government is avoiding beating the drums of success
 1
 The Skill India Skill India Scheme was launched by the NDA Government on 15 July 2015
 khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne antarrashtriya yuva diwas ke maukey par iskaa shubharambh kiya tha
 The campaign aims to train around 40 crore people in India in different skills by 2022, who can become self-reliant after training
 skill india piem modi kaa ek dream project bhi he
 But the government has not achieved what was expected from this campaign
 sarkaar ko bhi iskaa aabhaash ho gaya he, isliye pichley saal hi sarkaar ne isamen bade badlaav karte hue rajeev pratap rudi se is mantralay kaa prabhaar le liya tha
 The opposition is now calling Skill India a flop
 vahiin sarkaar bhi is khuleam charchaa se bachati dikh rahi he, kyonki sarkaar ne jo lakshya tay kiya tha usase maujuuda aankade kaaphi dur hai
 2
 notebandinotbandi ko lekar bhi sarkaar baikfoot par he
 The government hoped that this would expose black money on a large scale
 lekin 99
 3 per cent of the old notes were returned to the bank
 jisase vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa or tej kar diya
 Now BJP leaders refrain from mentioning in public meetings on demonetisation
 vahiin vipaksh kaa aarope he ki bina soche-samajhe piem modi ne desh main notebandi lagu kar diya
 Due to which cash crisis came in front of people and about 100 people died in the order of exchange of notes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi se 8 november 2016 ko notebandi kaa elaan kiya tha
 Under which the 1000 and 500 rupee notes were declared invalid
 3
 Black money Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi himself bombarded the UPA government with questions about the return of black money
 unhone logon se vaada kiya tha centre main NDA kii sarkaar banate hi kaledhan ke masale par bada parinaam dikhegaa
 But more than four years have passed and the government has not achieved any major success on this issue
 videshon main jamaa kalaadhan abhi tak waapas nahin aa paaya he
 Now the government is avoiding discussing issues like black money
 vahiin vipaksh kaa kahana he ki kaledhan vaapasi par modi sarkaar ne abhi tak koi sarthak kadam nahin uthaaya he
 4
 smart city2014 main deshbhar main 100 shaharon ko smart banane ke liye 'smart city' ke naam ye yojana laanch kii gai thi
 For this, several other initiatives including investment of more than Rs 6,85,758 crore were taken to develop a citizen-friendly urban area
 is mishan main 100 shaharon ko shaamil kiya gaya he or isaki avadhi paanch saal (vittiya varsh 2015-16 se vittiya varsh 2019-20) tak kii he
 But now it seems that this government project has gone into cold storage
 kyonki chaar saal kaa vakt biit chukaa he or kaam abhi us teji se nahin ho paaya he, jo rodmap taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 There is no definite deadline on how long this project will be completed
 yani modi sarkaar kii yah ek aisi yojana thi, jisase logon ko kaaphi ummiden thim
 But in four years, the result has not been received as expected
 5
 The Namami Gange yojanamodi government had given a hunger for cleaning the Ganges in 2014, soon after coming to power, a separate ministry was made to make the Ganga clean and the responsibility was given to Uma Bharti
 sarkaar ne is yojana par 5 saal main 20 hajaar karod rupee nirdhaarit kiya he
 Large amount of this was also spent, but the Ganges remained dirty
 phir aanan-fanan ganga mantralay nitin gadakari ko saunpa gaya
 The government also feels that the speed with which the Ganga cleaning work was to be done could not be done
 abhi bhi sarkaar is par khulkar kuch bhi bolne se batch rahi he
 Now Nitin Gadkari says that by 2020, the Ganges water will be worth drinking
 lekin ganga safai ke naam par vipaksh sarkaar ko gherne main juta rahata he
 The opposition says that the Namami Gange scheme is lagging behind the target due to the irregularity in financial management and the latency in making schemes for Ganga cleaning
 katrina caff or ranbir kapur ke relationships kaa future kya rahegaa, is baat par in donon main se koi coment nahin karata
 a glimpse of the growing proximity between them is clearly seen in the photos taken on Ibiza Island in Spain
 ranbir to pehle hi jagajaahir kar chuke hai ki katrina unki jindagi main ek khaas shaks hai
 Now Kat has also spoken openly about their relationship
 ek akhbaar se baatcheet main cat ne kaha, ' main ranbir kaa bahut khyaal rakhti hum or use lekar bahut sanjeeda hum
 He also said that soul connection is essential for boding like Ranbir and his relationship
 haal hi main katrina ne bayaan diya ki ranbir unki jindagi kaa bahut bada hissaa hai
 But recently she has no wedding plan

 There are differences in democracy
 ham ekadusre kii mukhaalafat bhi karte hai lekin manabhed nahin hona chahie
 These things reached the agenda in Aaj Tak, Congress MP and mp's campaigner Jyotiraditya Scindia in MP
 rajdeep saradesai ne unase us tasviir ke bare main poocha tha jisamen jyotiraditya, empi ke purv siem shivaraj singh chouhan or empi ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ek saath janata kaa abhivadan karte dekhe ja rahe hai
 Why doesn't such a picture appear in Delhi? modi or sonia ekasaath kyon nahin baithte, rahul or modi main is tarah kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 Scindia said that we keep differences but do not have any discrimination
 rahul gandhi agar manabhed rakhte to sansad main modi kaa haath nahin pakadte
 Scindia said that we accept that we have won very finely
 hamen empi main 114 siten mili hai, bijepi ko 109 siten mili hai
 BJP has got 1 percent more votes from Congress
 yah loktantr he or vah sapa or basapa ke saath hi bijepi vidhayakon ko bhi badhai dete hai
 He said that now elections have been held
 matbhed hote hai lekin manabhed nahin he
 The state has to be taken forward by taking everyone along
 aap 15 saal ke shashan ko khatm nahin paae
 To this, Scindia said that we do not talk of annihilating anyone
 prajatantr main vipaksh nahin ek majboot vipaksh kaa hona jaruri he
 Differences arise from differences
 sindhiya ne kaha ki ham jite hai lekin bahut baariki se
 Scindia made a big difference between the BJP of 1994-96 and the BJP of today
 unhone kaha ki bajpeyi insaan the, aaj bhi kootneetigyon kii jarurat nahin he, aaj achche insaanon kii jarurat he
 On whether the election year is coming, whether the charge will increase the phase of counter-attack, Scindia said that it is the job of the opposition to highlight the shortcomings of the ruling party
 vipaksh ko aarope lagane ke saath samaadhaan bhi bataanaa chahie
 When compared to Bajpayee and Narendra Modi, Scindia said that the comparison of the two is not good
 unhone koi aisa piem nahin dekha jo apane siem ko rajdharm kaa paalan karne kii baat kare
 Scindia said that defeating BJP is not the goal, it is the goal to win the country

 a similar statement came out of the Congress camp during the election campaign and the BJP used it as a missile and destroyed the fort of the Congress-led alliance
 vah bayaan tha sam pitroda kaa jo ki sikh dangon ko lekar diya gaya tha- 'hua to hua'
 In every subsequent election speech, PM Modi explained the meaning of this statement to the people and said that the Congress is not sensitive to the people
 vah laaparvaah he or kisi bhi galati ko gambhirtha se nahin leti he
 This thing appealed to the people
 'chaukeedaar chor he' ke rahul gandhi vaale bayaan par bhi maamla ulajh gaya
 Its advantage was nowhere to be seen

 Together we prosper
 Together we will build a strong and inclusive India
 India wins yet again! # vijayibharat Today's victory is also pointing out that India's politics is not going to be governed only by caste mathematics
 iskaa sanchaalan vanshavaad nahin kar saktaa
 The people are ready to give up casteism in front of nationalism
 kshetravaad or algaavvaad janata ko sweekaar nahin he
 For a clean and healthy India, the people here want to rely on a strong and capable party to solve all their problems
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha yah desh apni aakankshaon ko, apane sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye nikal padaa he jis par desh kii janata ne vishwaas kar liya he
 At the same time, the message is also reaching among those who do politics that now neither old-fashioned politics will work nor old maneuvers are going to work
 raajnneetik vishleshak jo apni soch ko antim sach maan rahe the vaise raajnneetik vishleshkon ko ab apni soch kaa dhang badalanaa hoga

 jis essi-asti act ko lekar bispi or tamaam dalit partiyaan shahar-shahar rankshetra bana chuki hai, vahi essi-asti act main uttar pradesh main mayawati ke shashan ke dauraan na sirf sanshodhit kiya gaya tha, balki is kanoon ko halkaa bhi kiya gaya tha
 The funny thing is that this amended law is still applicable in Uttar Pradesh
 aaj bhi upi main essi-asti act ko alag tareeke se lagu kiya jaataa he, jiske tahat ab sidhe giraftaar nahin hoti he
 On April 2, the entire nation witnessed the violence that was spread by the Dalit organizations on the streets in several states, including Uttar Pradesh, on this law, but only two days after this violence, that government order of Mayawati government once again came to the fore
 In which the SC-ST Act was not only amended, but a section 182 was passed by imposing an order that if anyone misuses it, then action should also be taken against it
 Gee itnaa hi nahin, essi-asti act main giraftaar tabhi hogi, jab sio str kaa koi adhikari apni vivechna main maamle ko sahi paaegaa
 On May 20, 2007, Prashant Kumar, the then Chief Secretary under the rule of BSP supremo Mayawati, made some major changes in the Scheduled caste-tribe Act by taking out a government order, under which the SP or SSP had to give their deliberations before implementing this act in cases like murder and rape Have to do
 sarkari aadesh main saaf-saaf likhaa tha ki kisi bhi nirdosh ko is act ke tahat na to pareshaan kiya janaa chahie or na hi fansaaya janaa chahie or agar koi aisa karata he, to uske khilaaf dhara 182 ke tahat karrwai hogi
 It may be known that this government order, taken out under Mayawati's rule, is still in force in Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati kaa yah aadesh anusuchit jati-janajati adhinium main sanshodhan ke taur par mana jaataa he, jiske tahat nirdosh logon ko fansaane kii gunjaaish kam ho jaati he
 However, against the decision of the Supreme Court, many of the leaders arrested in the streets in Uttar Pradesh are from Bahujan Samaj Party
 mayawati khud bhi ab khulkar supreme court ke faisle ke virodh main hai, lekin unke shashan ke dauraan kaa unka hi aadesh alag kahani kahata he
 Since Mayawati's copy of this order came to light, the BJP has come under attack on BSP supremo Mayawati and openly accuses Mayawati that Mayawati herself, the first and the most vulnerable to this act made for Dalits and Adivasis
 Have done ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki har baat kaa binduvaar jawaab dene vaali mayawati apane hi is sarkari aadesh ke saamne aane ke baad kya tark saamne rakhti he? Defense Minister Chuck Hagel resigned from his post today amid reports of differences with US President Barack Obama
 obama ne white house main is raajnneetik ghatnakram ke bare main khud elaan kiya
 a few hours before this announcement, Hegel submitted his resignation
 raashtrapati kii ore se nae raksha mantri ke naam kaa elaan or is par seenet kii muhar lagane tak hegal se is pad par bane rahane ke liye kaha kaha gaya he
 Obama told reporters, "chak has been a great defense minister, providing a strong support for the last nearly two years
 unke samay main hamane dirghakaalin khataron kaa muqabla karne ke liye apni ranneeti or bajet ko adhunik rup diya or ab bhi aies evam ibola jaisi chunautiyon kaa jawaab de rahe hai
 ' unhone kaha, 'pichley maheene chak mere paas raashtrapati kaarykaal ke aakhri ke vashren ke bare main charchaa ke liye aae the or unhone yah patibaddhta dikhaai ki is badlaav ke jariye vibhaag ko nirdeshit karte hue ab samay aa gaya he ki vah seva ko khatm karen
 'earlier, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta had served as defense ministers in the Obama administration
 obama ne kaha ki hegal ne raksha kshetra main unke prashasan kii uplabdhiyon main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 The US president said, "today, our men and women in uniform are fighting against IS in Iraq and Syria and Chuck helped to build international alliances to ensure that the world is combating this threat together
" ' At the same time, Hegel said that this is the right time to have a new leadership in the Pentagon
 unhone kaha, 'jaisaa ki raashtrapati ne bataaya he, maine aaj raksha mantri ke taur par apana istipha saunp diya
 It has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve with the men and women of the Department of Defense and to support and lead their families
 is dauraan hamane jo bhi uplabdhiyaan hasil kin, usko lekar mujhe bahut garv he
 ' hegal ke istipha dene kii taiyaari ke bare main khabar sabase pehle 'da neuyork times' ne di
 According to the newspaper, Obama was not satisfied with the global crisis, including the spread of IS

 The US International Religious Freedom Commission (USCIRF) issued a statement on the Citizenship Amendment bill, calling it a "dangerous step in the wrong direction
" america agency ke is bayaan kaa bharat sarkaar ne aapatti jataai he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar has said that the statement of the International Religious Freedom Commission of America is not correct, adding that the Citizenship Amendment Bill will give citizenship to religious minorities who have come from countries where they are being tortured

 Meanwhile, since Monday morning, many mlas have written letters demanding action against Amanatullah
 ab faisla party kii political afaire kamity ko lenaa hai, jahaan kumaar vishwaas or amanatulla khan aamane-saamne ho sakate hai
 Against whom PAC will take action, in such a situation the question arises that if PAC takes action against Amanatullah Khan, will this PAC also take action on Kumar Vishwas's statement publicly? Was such a role designed so that the party's action does not seem unilateral just because who is the real face behind Amanatullah's sudden statement? This still remains a big question

 dilli police ne rajdhani se avaidh sharaab kaarobaari ke don ko giraftaar kiya he
 The arrested mafia Kuldeep and Mannu have been doing illegal liquor business in Delhi for a long time, and even if someone comes in the middle of their illegal business, attacking them will not stop

 According to the excise department, these people supply more than 3 thousand illegal liquor boxes in outer Delhi only every day
 vahiin dilli ke alag ilaakon main inkaa ye kaarobaar kaaphi teji se fal phool rahaa he
 According to sources, when the Excise team was attacked, the police started the exercise to catch them
 dabaav badha to in donon sharaab maafiyon ne guuruuvaar ko north-west special staff main sarender kar diya
 There are dozens of cases of liquor smuggling on both liquor mafia

 According to the excise department, with the proceeds of illegal liquor, they live in expensive kothis and move around in luxury vehicles
 exise sutron kii maane to organij krime main inaki is tarah santh-ganth aisi he ki ye apni marji se apane cese ko suvidhanusaar transfar tak karvaa dete hai
 According to officials of the Excise Department, on July 1, illegal liquor was reported
 jiske baad mongolpuri ilaake main unhone jaal bichaaya lekin kuldeep or mannu ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar dandon or bear kii botalon se adhikariyon par hamalaa kar diya
 In which the soldiers and the constable of the Excise Department were badly injured
 peedit ke mutabik ye sharaab mafia unki hatya karnaa chaahate the lekin kisi tarah se wo batch gaye
 At present, 2 liquor mafia are under the control of the police, while the search for the rest of their associates is on
 sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir ye sharaab mafia bin kisi shay ke kaise apane avaidh sharaab ke dhandhe ko itani aasaani se chalaa rahe the
 In such a situation, it is natural to question the functioning of the police

 On 8 March, on the occasion of International Women's Day, Narendra Modi met women in the country and abroad amidst a cup of tea
 nai dilli main bijepi mukhyalay par yojit do ghante ke is kaarykram main mahilaon se ghire baithe modi ne mahila shashaktikaran ke bare main apni raay rakhi or sawaalon ke jawaab die
 The special feature of this program was that through live telecast, Narendra Modi was present simultaneously in 1500 cities in 500 cities at the same time
 paanch mahadwipon or 15 deshon main alag-alag jagahon par modi ek saath pahunche
 Also in many cities like Washington, London, Frankfurt, Sydney and Nairobi
 chunaav prachaar ke liye takanic ke istemaal kaa yah ek behtareen namoona he
 On the one hand, bjp's leaders in Delhi have been at loggerheads over ticket distribution, their seats, potential allies and alliances
 loksabhaa kii ek-ek seat ke liye aapas main jhagad rahe hai or apni chhavi chamakaane ke chakkar main party kii andruni kalah ko sataha par laa rahe hai
 Instead of 'party with a Difference', they are trying to remind us again of the old tag line of 'party with Differences'
 aise main in sabase dur narendra modi apane jivan kii sabase kathin ladaai ko janata ke bich sidhe le ja rahe hai
 Communicating directly with the common people through rallies and technology
 is prakriya main party ke bheetar unhone apana kad ooncha kar liya he or dilli ke netaa unke saamne achaanak boune lagane lage hai
 In the two-hour program on Chai Pe Charcha, Narendra Modi spoke first and then answered tens of questions such as his protection of women from the country and abroad, place in society, status of equality, laws made for women
 modi ne aadhi aabaadi kii aazaadee kii vakaalat kii
 Freedom to choose education, career, life partner and family
 modi ne mahilaon kii shiksha kii jarurat par mahatma gandhi kii baat aage badhaate hue kaha ki jab ek mahila shikshit hoti he, to do parivaar nahin, do peediyaan shikshit ho jaati hai
 To increase women safety, it is necessary to increase the number of women in the police force
 raajnneeti main mahilaon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke liye narendra modi ne sansad main mahilaon ke liye ek-tihaai aarakshan ke liye lambey samay se latake mahila aarakshan bill ko turant paas karne kii maang bhi kii he
 In the last three assembly elections, Narendra Modi has received tremendous support of women in Gujarat
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bijepi ne haal ke vidhansabha chunaavon main madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main bhi mahila or yuva matadaataaon par khaas jor diya or use iskaa phayda bhi mila
 In Rajasthan, BJP kept Vasundhara Raje ahead and won a historic victory in the elections
 chhattisgarh-madhya pradesh main saste daamon par gehun-chaaval kii yojanaon ke zarie mahilaon ko lubhaaya
 The Congress was targeted for the deteriorating house budget due to rising inflation
 alpiji silinderon main katautee or kerosene ke bade daam in chunaavon main bada mudde bane or mahilaon ne inke liye centre kii upie sarkaar ko jimmedaar maanate hue bijepi ko badi sankhya main vot diya
 The Nirbhaya incident in Delhi brought the issue of women's safety to the center and the Congress had to bear the brunt of it
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki kisi bhi parivaar main yah faisla karne main ki vot kise dena he, ghar ke sabase bujurg vyakti kii raay ahm hoti ai he
 But now things are changing
 shaharon main parivaar chote hote ja rahe hai
 The tradition of joint families is coming to an end
 kisi bhi shahar ke ek chote parivaar, jisamen mata-pita kaam par jate hai or putr-putree college, vahaan sabhi samvedansheel faislon main ghar kii stri kii badi bhoomika ho gai he
 So the effort should be to take full care of the issues related to women, so that on the day of polling, there is no problem in taking the votes of that family into your account
 iske liye bijepi ne mahangaai or mahila suraksha jaise muddon par khaas dhyaan dene kaa faisla kiya he
 During the discussion on tea, Narendra Modi lashed out at the UPA government for spending a penny from the Nirbhaya Fund of one thousand crore rupees in the name of women safety
 isi tarah 181 number ke helpline band hone kaa bhi zikr kiya, jahaan kaam kar rahi mahila karmchaariyon ko paisa nahin diya gaya
 In its election manifesto and vision document, BJP will pay special attention to women
 modi ne kaha he ki party kaa lakshya azaadi ke 75 saal puure hone par 2022 tak har ghar main bijli, pani or shiksha kii suvidha pahunchaana he
 When it comes to the question of women voters, no political party wants to be left behind to woo them
 vyaktigat chhavi ke chalate congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or narendra modi donon hi mahilaon main behad lokapriy hai
 Perhaps this is why the BJP has come into the fray with concrete issues and promises so that it can take the women voters and Modi has taken the command in front of it
 madhya pradesh main mahilaon kii aabru lutane kaa daur tham nahin rahaa he
 On late Sunday night, a young woman found it expensive to defecate in Betul district

 Finding him alone outside the house, two youths committed the gang-rape incident with him
 yuvati ne ghar aane ke baad der raat ko faansee ke fande se latakkar aatmahatya kar lee
 The family came to know about the incident on Monday morning
 iske baad parijanon ne police ko suchit kiya
 The police team reached the spot
 thana prabharee keaar silaale ne bataaya ki peedit yuvati ne suicide note main do yuvakon dwaara gangrape kiye jane kaa zikr kiya he
 Baldev Dhurve and Rajesh Kakodia were arrested on this basis
 peedita ne shaayad badanaami ke dar se aatmahatya jaisaa kadam uthaaya he
 The matter is being investigated
 yuvati ke parijanon kaa kahana he ki aatmahatya se pehle likhe gaye suicide note se pataa chalaa he ki uske saath ravivaar kii raat gaanv ke do yuvakon ne gangrape kiya tha
 This caused her mental anguish, she felt that if the society would know, she would not be able to show her face
 isliye usne aatmahatya jaisaa kadam uthaaya
 Data from the National Crime Statistics Bureau (NCRB) confirms that Madhya Pradesh tops the country in crimes against women
 rajdhani main beete maah koching se laut rahi ek chaatra ke saath hue gangrape kii ghatana ne sarkaar or police prashasan kii neend uda di thi

 itnaa hi nahin, rajya sarkaar 12 varsh se kam umr kii balikaon se rape karne waalon kofaansee kii sajadene kaa vidheyak paarit kar chuki he
 Yet the government is not able to control such incidents
 bijepi ke nilambit saansad ram jethmalani ne raajnneeti main apane aane par pachhtaawaa jaahir kiya or yah kehete hue netaaon par nishaanaa saadhaa ki jab unamem se koi ek nadi main duubataa he to ‘yah pradooshan he or jab unamem se sabhi dubkee lagaate hai to yah samaadhaan hota he
 Jethmalani said, "leaders are not going to solve the world's problems
 netaa ek aisa varg he jiske saamne main haar maanata hum
 My only drawback is that i am more of a lawyer and less of a leader
 or isiilie main ek safal netaa nahin hum
 However, Jethmalani refused to answer questions related to the controversy related to the resignation of BJP President Nitin Gadkari on his behalf and the appointment of Ranjit Sinha to the post of CBI Director

 But the fans are very keen to know the reason behind this walk

 It is clear that on the eve of the Railway Budget, Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has become a man who seems to be stuck in a painful triangle of loyalty, conscience and uncertainty
 unki nishtha trinmul congress kii apni netaa mamata banerjee ke prati he, jo chaahati hai ki ve yatri bhaade main badhotaree na karke vaahvahee kii raajnneeti ko jari rakhaa jaae or is tarah railway ko diwaliyapan kii ore dhakela jaae
 But his conscience is in trouble with the fact that Rs 16,000 crore
 kaa ghaataa railway kaa munh taak rahaa he
 All the indications are that Trivedi is ready to listen to his conscience and has made up his mind to announce a hike in passenger fares, which will increase 10% of all freight and mainly those traveling in AC The passenger fare will be balanced by targeting the passengers
 farvari8 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india today1 farvari 2012: tasveeron main india tudinischitataayen is sambhaavna main fansi hui hai ki uttar pradesh ke chunaavon ke baad rajnatik paristhitiyaan ulat-pulat ho sakati hai
 If the circumstances are suddenly out of control, it may be that they do not get a chance to present that budget, although they have worked hard to prepare the railway budget
 desh bhar ke rail adhikariyon ke saath hui apni kai baithkon main se ek main trivedi apane is dharm sankat ko bakhubi jaahir kar chuke hai
 After repeatedly getting the message that there would be a need to increase the passenger fares, he told the officials that he had loyalty to the Railways and he had to fulfill his duty
 unhone kaha, ''
 
 
 If there is a need to increase passenger fares, i will increase it
 '' haalanki kuch second kii chuppi ke baad, bahaduree se bhare in shabdon ke baad kuch nistej shabd yun foot pade, ''agar mujhe bajet pesh karne diya gaya to
 
 
 An official of the North East Frontier Railway Zone said that during the 20-minute period, the minister kept swinging between hope and despair
 unke iraade bahut spasht the or saath hi yah tathy bhi spasht tha ki ve laachaar hai
 Although the minister, while talking to India Today, denied that he was powerless, he stressed that he had got all kinds of freedom to prepare the budget
 unhone mana ki yatri bhaade main vruddhi karnaa 'vaicharik mudda' he, lekin ek mantri ke naate, ve vahi karenge, jo karnaa jaruri hoga
 Sources close to him claim that Trivedi considers himself like a soldier on duty, and he is not afraid of losing his life in retaliatory firing
 ek sutara ne bataaya, ''unhone apni bendle (lakjri car) ke badale sarkari ambeseder kabool kar lee he
 He will ride back to his Bentley and become a businessman
 ''aise tamaam kisse hai, jo unke najdiki log sunaate hai or jinase pataa chalata he ki mamata un par kis tarah kaabo rakhana chaahati hai
 At the end of January, he has been pulled over to meet Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi at his house
 3 farvari ko apane kolkata karyaalay main mamata ne trivedi se is par safai maangi or aarope lagaaya ki ve apana kaam-kaaj congress ke ishaaron par anjaam de rahe hai
 Trivedi is said to have responded to Mamata that he had gone to discuss railway projects for Uttar Pradesh and also said that since he had known former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi since his pilot days, he would be accompanied by that family
 They have kindred relations
 trivedi khud certyphoid payalat hai
 At the time of Rajiv Gandhi's funeral in 1991, he was with Rahul
 yah to pataa nahin ki tunakmizaaj mamata is spashtikaran se santusht hui yaa nahin, lekin trivedi khud bhi bandhan mahasoos kar rahe hai
 He has pointed out the restrictions under which he has to work from various public forums
 fikki kii ore se 31 janvari ko yojit india pipipi summit-2012 main trivedi ne vikaas kii ek purv shart ke taur par railway ko 'raajnneeti se pare karne' kii jarurat par bal diya tha
 He had called for a national policy for railways, which remained intact even if the government or railway minister changed
 trivedi ne kaha tha ki is niti ko rajasav kaa model sthapit karnaa chahie, jiskaa mukhya dhyaan suraksha or yatri suvidhaon par ho
 He also suggested an independent body - the Railway Fare Authority, which could take decisions on railway fares without being influenced by political constraints
 labboluab ekadam spasht he
 Many railway ministers prior to Trivedi have extensively exploited the railways to bake their political loaves
 unamem mamata bhi shaamil hai, jinhone kolkata kii riters bildag tak pahunchane ke liye rail mantralay ko padaav ke taur par istemaal kiya tha
 Before him, Lalu Prasad Yadav had good luck floating on the wave of development and he was so clever that he handed over the administration of the railway to a clever officer, officer on special duty Sudhir Kumar
 rail bhaade main badhotaree karne vaale antim mantri 2002-03 main nitish ku maar the
 Since then, the rail freight has been running as usual

 railway ko waapas patari par laane ke liye jitne paison kii jarurat he, use dekhte hue yah raashi oont ke munh main jire ke samaan he
 Trivedi has said that the Railways will get 14 lakh crore rupees by 2020 to increase capacity and modernize
 kii jarurat hogi
 They themselves admit that the railway is still stuck in the 'stone Age'
 rail mantri trivedi kehete hai ki ek mantri ke taur par ve jo kuch dekh chuke hai, vah gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 He says, "if we don't modernize the railway, i don't think we can guarantee 100 percent safety

 There was a lot of uproar in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in protest against the attack on the Congress Legislature Party on Wednesday and Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya's assurance to take strict action against any CPI-M member involved in this attack was of little effect

 apni acting se bollywood main mukaam banane vaale arshad varsi aaj parichay ke mohataaj nahi hai
 As soon as Arshad Warsi's name comes up, people remember his character in 'sahar', 'golmaal', 'jolly LLB' and Munnabhai series
 ab jald hi unki film 'guddu rangila' relies hone ke liye taiyaar he, hamane jab baat kii arshad varsi se to unhone film ke bare main kai khaas baaten bataai
 Let us know what Arshad told our team about something special
 suna he kaaphi gambhir he aapkaa 'rangila' vaala kirdaar?ji bilkul sahi baat he, lekin maine diarector subhash kapur ko bolaa tha ki meraa naam badal de yaar kyonki meraa naam rangila he par rangila vaale saare kayemit sadhakarta he
 The Guddu that is rangila is rangila and rangila is not colored at all
 baharhaal jo meraa kirdaar he wo pehle kaaphi khushmijaaj hua karata tha lekin jaise-jaise jindagi main badlaav aate hai ye thodaa gambhir ho jaataa he
 But according to the way Subhash has written, 'rangeela' continues to entertain despite being serious
 kya aapkaa kirdaar manoj ke kirdaar se miltaa julata he jisaki honor kiling ke dauraan maut ho gayi thi?dekhiye us haadase kaa aanshik taur par prayog kiya gaya he lekin puri film us par aadhaarit nahin he
 The film is the story of Guddu and Rangeela
 mere kirdaar kaa ateet hi bas manoj kii kahani se prerit he
 You are also a crazy dancer, have you got a chance to dance in this film? No man, my bad luck is, i have danced according to the character in 'mata Ka e-mail'
 aap dance karnaa miss nahin karte?karata hum yaar, kya karen film hi aisi ban rahi he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki aane vaali film 'frod saiyaan' main mujhe acha dance karne kaa mauka milegaa
 i will probably look at the title song
 aapako lagata he kii subhash kapur kii filmein kuch vakt baad zyada prabhaav karti hai?mere hisaab se subhash kaa style 'realistic commercial' he, or is tarah kii filmein mujhe pasand hai
 i have luckily got Subhash who writes this type of films
 to ham donon kaa conection baith gaya he
 After 'jolly LLB', people will go to see Subhash's films in a moment
 kya aap tipical kamedi vaali filmein miss karte hai?mujhe har tarah kii filmein karnaa pasand he
 On one side, i do 'sahar' and on the other side i do 'guddu Rangeela', then i do both comedy and serious films
 haal hi main maine pankaj parashar kii ek script suni he, or uske prati meraa intrest bad bhi rahaa he
 They have heard me a comedy script
 usamen do ladako ke saath paagalapanthi vaali kamedi hogi or wo mere 'dhamal' or 'golmaal' vaale spes main jaayegi
 Do you think that making a 'biopic' is the easiest thing? No, not at all, especially for the actor is a very difficult task
 kabhibiopikkarna chahenge?mujhe bahut pehle 'faujee' serial ke diarector karnal kapur ne 'vir shivaji' ke upar byopic likhi thi or wo chaahate the kii main us kirdaar ko nibhaauun
 He had said that i would be able to do full justice to that role
 mujhe aashaa he aane vaale dinon main agar koi us film ko banaaye to jarur karnaa chaahunga
 There was news that if Aamir Khan plays the role of 'circuit' then you will do Dhoom 3? Aamir said that he has to play the circuit, this is his nobility, he is saying like this

 It will take some time
 sanju (sanjay dutt) thodaa baahar aa jaae, relax kar le phir dats vagairah edjust kii jaayegi
 But it will definitely happen
 aap industry main asurakshit mahasoos karte hai?ji nahin, agar aapako apane job ke bare main pataa he to aapako asuraksha mahasoos nahin hogi
 Like today Amit ji (amitabh Bachchan), Naseeruddin Shah, Rishi Kapoor can work for life
 to main bhi aaj aise kirdaar nibhaa rahaa hum, aage pita kaa, phir dada kaa

 For 15 years she continued to play basketball as a normal player

 But there was a pleasant change for Karthiki in 2014 when he came to know about the wheelchair basket ball
 kartiki ko to jaise basket bal ke taur par zindagi hi waapas mil gai
 Karthiki did not look back again and now he is the captain of India in this game

 prasoon joshine bataaya ki babul geet maine ek ladki ke man kii vyathaa par likhaa tha ki ek ladki kya sochati hogi jab use apane pita kaa ghar chhodana padataa he
 So i wrote this song
 jab prasoon se ye poocha gaya ki ladakiyon ke man or unke sapanom se kuch to lagaav he tabhi unhone bahut kuch likhaa he, iskaa javabprasoon ne ye paktiyaan sunaakar diya
 'the sun had to be given sunshine and the daughter had to be brought in the morning and it was morning
 
 
 'prasoon joshine kavita or gaanon kaa jivan main mahatv bataaya or kaha ki kavi kaa kaam he ki man ke vichaaron ko abhivyakti den or use sabake saamne laaen
 Now it is your job to understand it
 is par prasoon ne kuch likhaa he
 a few lines of the same
 
 
 lakshya dhundte hai ve jinako vartmaan se pyaar nahin he
 Who has little authority over the dignity of the moment
 is kshan kii golai dekho, naarangi tarunai dekho, dur kshitij par bikhar rahi he
 Those who find favor are not those who accept this life
 jabprasoon se poocha gayaaki aap hameshaa kuch aisa dhundte hai jo aapke or saamne vaale ke vichaaron main saamanjyas bitha de? iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki aisa hi hota he jab main likhata hum or vahiin meri filmon main bhi dikhataa he
 The poem is also the same
 sab kuch rachaa ja chukaa he or kavi kaa kaam he us rachana ko apni lekhnee se shabdon main utaarna
 Thinking that you wrote the mother song of the film on the stars? In response, Prasoon said that when i was separated from my mother once in my childhood, i remembered my mother in many ways and thinking about that, i wrote this song
 maa se dur ek baccha kis tarah apni maa ko yaad karegaa or bas is gane har mata-pita or bachche ke dil main jagah bana lee
 
 maa par likhane ke baad maine pita ke liye bhi likhaa kyonki is gane ko likhane ke baad mujhe kai pitaaon ke khat aae ki ham itane bhi bure nahin hai
 Just because i wrote something for my father too
 prasoon joshi ne olympic main ladakiyon ke medal laane par apni rachana sunai
 Shame is it not, to the society that did not openly celebrate its birth, to the shame that is coming, not to the father who is having a lamp less lit
 No, those rituals, those customs, those fetters, those doors
 Koshram is coming, not the old people who have connected her existence to the dark, but the clothes are coming, and the clothes that break her from inside are not coming
 To the offices, the path is getting angry, those words, those songs which have never understood it more than the body, the religion is not coming, the politics is getting the dreams of the people who are humiliated again and again
 The walls should be full of flames, every thought that cut its wings should be ashamed, every thought that stopped it, should look at the sky Oh, maybe all of us
 kyonki jab mutthi main suraj liye nanhee si bitiyaa saamne khadi thi, tab ham uski ungaliyon se chhalkati roshni nahin, uskaa ladki hona dekh rahe theuski mutthi main tha aane vaala kal
 And everyone was looking beige today
 par suraj ko to dhoop khilaanaa thati ko to savera laana tha
 
 
 
 or subah ho kar rahi
 After taking power at the Center in 2014 and in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government, which formed the government with the PDP in 2016, has decided to resume dialogue, adopting a new strategy in Kashmir
 centre sarkaar kii tarafase purv IB chif dineshwar sharma ko kashmir main baatcheet kii prakriya ko aage badhaane ke liye niyukt kiya gaya he
 But the question is whether anything will be gained from this negotiation process or just another attempt to take time
 jammu kashmir main pichley saal 8 june ko hijbul commander burhan vaani ke encounter ke baad se hi ghati main halaat bigade hue hai
 For several months, the government adopted every tactic to overcome the unrest in Kashmir, but peace in Kashmir did not return
 ab sarkaar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke us bhaashan ko amal main laane ja rahi he jo unhone isi saal 15 agast ko laal kile se kaha ki nagoli se na gaali sekashmiriyon ko gale lagane se samasya kaa samaadhaan nikalegaa
 The central government returned to Vajpayee's formula, but the question is whether the BJP is changing its policy on Kashmir and is holding the path of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ne kargil yuddh ke baavjood pakistan ke saath-saath hurriyat netaaon se bhi baatcheet kii prakriya shuru kii thi
 But the reality is that the atmosphere of dialogue has not been created in Kashmir
 adhiktar hurriyat netaaon ke khilaaf NIA jaanch kar rahi he, jisamen se kai dilli ke jelon main band pade hai
 Army and security forces operations against terrorism continue all out and tensions remain along the border with Pakistan
 baatcheet kaa maahaul banane ke liye sarkaar ko pehle yah saaf karnaa padegaa kii vah baatcheet kaa maahaul kaise banaaegi or baatcheet kisase hogi
 Because in the last three years, Home Minister Rajnath Singh has met many representatives and political parties in Kashmir
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaishvanth sinhise bich kai baar kashmir daure par gaye or har baar unhone algaavvaadiyon sahit sabhi pakshon ke saath baatcheet shuru karne kii sifarish hi kii
 So has the government now made up its mind to talk to the Hurriyat
 baatcheet kaa netritv dineshwar sharma ko hi kyonkendre ke taaja faisle se yah to saaf sanket mil chukaa he ki sarkaar kashmir masale par hurriyat netaaon se bhi baatcheet kar sakati he
 But the question is also why the command of the talks was handed over to former IB Chief Dineshwar Sharma
 vastav main dineshwar sharma ke paas kashmir samasya ke samaadhaan kaa acha khaasaa anubhav he
 Dineshwar Sharma handled Kashmir affairs at a time when terrorism was at its peak
 dineshwar sharma ke saamne kashmir main sabase kathin paristhiti tab dar-pesh ai thi jab may 1995 main mast gul kii aguai main 30 videshi aatankiyon ne ek maheene tak charaare-sharif kii mashhoor dargah ko apane kabje main le rakhaa tha
 a major army campaign was then conducted to get the terrorists out of charare-sharif
 tab is tarah kii khabaren bhi ai thim ki tatkaaleen sarkaar ne mast gul sahit kai videshi aatankiyon ko dargah se nikalne ke liye surakshit rasta de diya tha or dargah ko aatankiyon ke changul se chhudvaaya tha
 But it remains to be seen when Dineshwar Sharma reaches the valley and when he gives his report to the government
 congress ke vayovruddh netaa narayan dutt tiwari ne apane khilaaf pitrutv mukademe main haar kaa saamana karne ke baad kaha ki is maamle se koi ‘mudda’ nahin banaaya janaa chahie or unhen apni sharton par jeene kaa adhikaar he lekin unhen apane jaivik putr rohit shekhar ke prati koi gilaa shikawa nahin he
