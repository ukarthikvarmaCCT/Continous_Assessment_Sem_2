 com / hwbkp1a5sm bhartiya cricket ke sabase kaamyaab captainon main se ek saurav ganguli or nae ubharate sitare ravichandran aswin baatcheet main bataa rahe hai ki is khel ke shikhar par pahunchane ke liye kya karnaa hota he
 Ashwin recalls how he started as a batsman, then became a medium-speed bowler and finally came to off-spin, in which he is very successful
 ve ganguli ko yah bhi yaad dilaate hai ki kis tarah unhen khelte dekh ve bade huesorav gangulihapako apane record dekhne kaa mauka mila?ravichandran asvinahaan, maine dekha he or mujhe pataa he ki aap bhi recodrs par najar rakhte hai
 At one time, i was one of those children who used to watch you play and was inspired by the way the Indian cricket team played
 ab aapke saath ek manch par hona romaanchakaari he
 Saurav: What do you like, batting or bowling? Ashwin: Bowling privately
 par ballebaaji bhi mujhe pasand he
 Initially i was an opener
 af -spin gendbaaj main baad main bana, vah bhi medium fast bowling karne ke baad
 Sourav: Your length is suitable to be a fast bowler but you become a spinner
 maine bhi thodi-bahut medium pes bowling kii he or mujhe jab ek wicket mil jaataa tha to test main half centuri banane jitani khushi hoti thi
 My batting was good, not bowling
 lekin aap donon main achche hai
 I've seen your game, especially the batting
 aapane kuch acchhee paariyaan kheli hai, england ke khilaaf or newjiland ke khilaaf bhi
 What is special about your batting? Ashwin: Since i started playing first-class cricket, my bowling has helped my batting a lot, in terms of understanding the phases of the game
 apane pratham shrenee ke kariyar main main jaldi hi captain ban gaya or khel ke utaar-chadhaavon ko samajhane laga, jinka main apni ballebaaji main istemaal karata hum, khaskar jab main middle order main aata hum
 Ashwin: More than your centuries, many of your fiery innings are on my mind
 kya aap natwest siries (2002) ke bare main bataaenge jisamen aapane gendbaajon kii dhajjiyaan uda di thim?sauravensal main us siries main main ran nahin bana paa rahaa tha
 Had a half century and was then ruled out
 darasal jon rhite ke saath meri thodi-si kahasuni ho gai thi or uske agle din main bangkshatag karne gaya
 We were chasing a target of 325 and i could not be defensive
 mujhe bhartiya team ko acchhee shuruyaat deni thi
 Sehwag and i went to bat and those were the days when you hit the ball well and it went straight into the flying stand
 vah shandaar lakwaha tha or main ise tivi par dekhtaa rahata hum jab maine shart utaari thi
 It was not even that my body is like Virat Kohli with cuts and tattoos on it
 yah alag hi peedi he
 Ashwin: What you did was a kind of metamorphosis
 ham ise aage le ja rahe hai
 i remember when you caught Adam Gilchrist off Zaheer Khan in the Chaquipions Trophy (2000)
 sauravaywah aasaan kaich tha, maine use aisa dikhaaya ki vah jaraa mushkil-sa lage
 Ashwin: That's not how difficult that catch was
 baat us massej kii he jo usne agali peedi ko diya
 i have been watching Test cricket since the age of five or six
 main radio par camentry sunata tha or un dinon india mushkil se koi match jeet paata tha
 Saurav: Tell us something about your studies
 asvinamaine skool main thik-thaak pradarshan kiya or anna uniwarsity se ejineering kii padhai puri kii
 How did it feel to see talented players around you, and especially at times when they sometimes did not perform well? Sourav: You get upset for a while and then you realize that they are humans too, even from them Mistakes can occur
 main pareshaan tha ki hamen natwest final main 325 ranon kaa peechha karnaa tha
 Virender Sehwag was following me while going to the ground for batting
 ve ek hindi gaanaa gunaguna rahe the
 i asked them, what is happening? They said that we will win this match
 sachin, ajahar or rahul ke paas bhi aise hi anubhav hai
 Ashwin: What was the experience like guiding these people? Chasing a score like 325 runs was a big thing in those days
 mujhe yaad he indian team kaa pichhlaa sabase acha score dhaka (1998) main 315 ran tha
 What are your memories of that match? Saurav: It got dark during the match
 stadium kii liten aisi nahin thim jaisi ab hoti hai
 It was a multipurpose stadium and football was also played there
 us match main baad main pakistani khiladinnon ko pataa nahin chal paa rahaa tha ki gend kahaan ja rahi he
 In those days, if both captains agreed, the lights would be lit
 sachin us match main bhi acha khele
 The good thing about playing with a player like him was that he takes all your pressure on himself
 maujuuda indian team main viraat kohli aisa hi karte hai
 Saurav: Which bowler do you take inspiration from? Ashwin: Shane Warne
 sauravamedia main kaha jaataa he ki aswin chennai ke sabase vinamr cricketer hai
 Of earlier shrikant, dinesh karthik or sadagopan ramesh the
 Ravichandran Ashwin is a different type of plant in Chennai
 kya yah sahi he?asvinamujhe lagata he ki aap 40 fisadi vahi hote hai jaisi aapaki parvarish hoti he, 40 fisadi aapaki talim kii dein hoti he or 20 fisadi isaki ki aap in donon kaa istemaal kaise karte hai
 My mother hails from a village in Tamil Nadu and has been a big inspiration for me
 ve chennai ain, yahaan padhin or ek korporate company ke saath kaam karne lageen
 Why was it so easy for you to play left arm spin or spin of any kind? Sourav: i could not score much runs on fast bowling
 mujhe left arm spin kaa hi phayda uthaanaa padaa
 I'm not as lucky as you
 asvinaedilade (2000 main pakistan ke khilaaf) main aapke banaae 141 ran se to aisa nahin lagata
 You played Wasim Akram so easily
 sauravamujhe team main apni jagah bhi to banaae rakhni thi
 Ashwin: It is not easy to win in Sri Lanka
 soravahyaad he, vahaan ham us vakt gaye the jab tatasth ampire nahin hote the
 It was a nightmare to dismiss Arvind desilva
 unhone abhaya kuruvilla tak ko gussa dilaa diya tha, jo aapaki tarah vinamr the, aise main aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki disilva ko kitni baar out karnaa padataa tha
 Talking of Sri Lanka, you lost the first match in Galle (2015), then defeated them 2–1
 yah vaapasi kisi thi?asvinasis team main gajab kii eemaandaaree he
 Everyone was very sad when we lost the match in Galle
 ham us par baatcheet kar rahe the, to maine kaha ki ham vaise kyon nahin khelte jaise ham nets par khelte hai? cheteshwar pujaara ne ek saal se ek bhi test match nahin khelaa tha or ranon ke bhukhe the
 Then we could see them applying hundreds
 sauravngkohli ke alaava aap is team main sabase keemtee shaks hai
 India Today asked me who is the most valuable player in the team? i said that i will give half a cent more to Virat
 indian cricket yahaan se kahaan jayega?asvinazham videshon main bhi jaakar jeet sakate hai
 We are putting full force in every matter
 mere liye pehali cheez fitness thi
 In the case of fast bowlers, we have handled it
 ab baat tej gendbaajon ko apana saamanjasy banaae rakhane kii he

 Lieutenant Colonel (retd) Josicilla Farida Rehana, the first female paratrooper (AMC) of the Indian Army, told IANS that it was nothing short of a lifetime achievement award for her
 1940 main mysore main janmi rehana 1964 main bhartiya sena main shaamil hui thim
 (input from IANS) saal 2018 main jiro kii asafalataa ke baad se shahrukh khan ne acting se brake liya he or ve is time ko parivaar ke saath relax karne main bitaa rahe hai
 Along with this, Shahrukh is also giving time to his Red Chillies production
 kuch samay pehle hi netflix par shahrukh ke production main bani web siries bord of blad ke pramotion main biji najar aae the
 Now, according to reports, Shahrukh is coming up with a political thriller project on Netflix
 isaki riting par shahrukh kaaphi dhyaan de rahe hai
 Sources close to the actor, in a conversation with Mid Day, said - Shah Rukh Khan has taken a break from acting at this time
 is dauraan ve apni team ke saath sho kii scrypting par kaam kar rahe hai
 The script will be based on political aspects
 ve politics kaa acha gyaan rakhte hai
 The source told, "they (shahrukh) are helping in scripting from their political point of view
 abhi is bare main kuch bhi safataur par saamne nahin aayaa he ki ve concept dene ke liye credit lenge yaa phir script likhenge
 However, for some time, Shah Rukh Khan has started focusing on writing
 "bord of blad kii baat karen to ye netflix par 27 sitambar ko jari kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, he is also co-producing a webseries named Betal, banner of Shahrukh
 websiries ko patric graham ne likhaa he
 It is co-directed by Nikhil Mahajan
 bataa den ki saal 2018 main shahrukh kii film jiro ko lekar prashansakon ke bich kaaphi baj tha
 But this film disappointed and it did not make a mark at the box office
 film main pehali baar shahrukh khan ek boune shaks kaa role play karte najar aae the

 biju janata dal (bijd) ke garh maane jane vaale odisha main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) jahaan apni jaden majboot karne main juty hui he, vahiin aisa lag rahaa he ki party ke andruni satta sameekaran bhi badal rahe hai
 Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has so far been considered the chief ministerial face of the BJP in this coastal state
 lekin, ab aisa lag rahaa he ki party apana rukh badal rahi he or purv iees afasar aparajita saarangi ko apane pramukh chehre ke taur par pesh kar rahi he
 There are huge hoardings in the capital of Odisha which have pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party candidate Aparajita Sarangi from here, but they do not appear to be Dharmendra Pradhan
 haalanki party, pradhan ke netritv main ekajute team ke rup main khud ko pesh kar rahi he lekin saarangi kii haisiyat isse alag lag rahi he
 Bihar-born IAS Sangee of the 1994 batch Odisha cadre took voluntary retirement last year and joined the BJP in November 
 vah kendriya gramin vikaas mantralay main sanyukt sachiv (manaregaa) ke pad par thim
 Aparajita is married to Odisha cadre IAS officer Santosh Sarangi
 vah abhi seva main hai or centre main niyukt hai
 Indirectly, one of the reasons for the change in the power equation is that the BJP is looking at an alliance with Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal in the event of not getting majority in the Lok Sabha elections
 patnayak kah chuke hai ki kisi ko bhi centre main bahumat nahin milane ja rahaa he or unki party centre sarkaar ke gathan main badi bhoomika nibhaane ja rahi he
 However, the BJP has made it clear that there is no power shift in the party in any way

 On Saturday, the police brought the three miscreants in a jeep from the police station in broad daylight and brought them to the market in Pardeshipura
 iske baad sadak par hi badmaashon kii danda or laat se jamkar pitayee kii
 The police took out a procession and got a sit-in meeting with the miscreants on the road itself
 badmaashon ko paradeshipura ke vyapaariyon ne pakadakar besabaal ke dandon se peeta or police ko somp diya tha
 Traders said that the crooks were demanding one lakh rupees

 This helped to bring the criminals in the city to a great extent
 lekin phir police thodi dhili padi ki badmaashon ne phir se sir uthaa liya tha
 The graph of crime in the city started increasing, so now it seems that the police are also changing their tone

 This is the village where Golu was born fourteen years ago
 jab vah mahaj teen saal kaa tha to 2004 main jhajjar main pehla 'champion' bana tha—singon kii shakl, chamadi ke rang or motaai tathaa sehat ke aadhaar par
 From then until five years ago, he had been winning every one of the 26 trophies of the match
 aaj bhi uske kandhe 5 foot 8 inch oonche hai or sir se poonch tak uski lambaai lagbhag 11 foot he
 Golu was the first in the illustrious tradition of Murrah buffaloes who are reshaping the farm economy from Haryana to neighboring Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal and far south in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana
 is bhainse ke maalik 42 varshiya narinder singh bade gaurav ke saath kehete hai, ''vah asli champion he
 "finally, in addition to the popularity gained from all the trophies won in animal encounters, Golu's high quality fertility earned him tremendous income
 golu se paidaa hue tamaam katte-kattiyaan aasapaas ke kai rajyon main hai or yaa to khub doodh dene vaali bhens ho gai hai yaa jawan tandoorust bhainse
 In the thriving village of Sunaria in Kurukshetra, 70 km from Didwari, people know the current champion buffalo Yuvraj (he is really named after the cricketer Yuvraj) more than his boss, 47-year-old Karamveer Singh
 yuvaraj kaa (maaf kiijie) karamvir singh kaa ghar teen manjila air condishand kothi he, kai esayuvi hai, kaaren hai or chamakate nae tractor
 But naturally the rarest of all is the seven-year-old buffalo — the centerpiece of the air-cooled cattle ranch that houses 24 buffaloes and a single cow
 karamvir uski khatirdaari main koi kami nahin rakhte or unka jor is baat par rahata he ki uskaa aaraam or khuraaq tuutane na paae
 Believe it, Yuvraj is bathed five times a day with fresh tubewell water and massaged every time with at least one and a half liters of raw condensed mustard oil
 uski dekhbhaal karne vaale biharvasi jitender or ram kumaar uske chamakate ghumaavdaar singon or khuron kaa khaas dhyaan rakhte hai
 To maintain good health of this young buffalo weighing 14 quintals, its diet includes twenty liters of creamy milk and ten kilos of apples in addition to protein and vitamin feed
 yuvaraj ko bhi khud ko mil rahi is dekhbhaal main kaaphi majaa aata he, khaas taur par jab log use dekhne ke liye aate hai
 And this happens very often
 jat bahul haryana main kisaanon or unke pashuon ke bich gahare rishte kii kahaniyaan pehle hi se kaaphi prachlit rahi hai, lekin golu or yuvaraj ab in kahaniyon ko ekadam nai shakl dene kii koshishon main jute hai
 What may have seemed a very unusual thing a decade ago, now more and more farmers are reaping murra buffalo to make a good profit by selling their semen
 bharat main bhainson kii 13 naslon main se madhya haryana kii murra bhainson kii maang sabase zyada he
 He is considered a 'breeder' and his gene pool has now spread to South Asia, South America, Mexico and West Asian countries
 yah nasl khaas taur par apni zyada doodh dene kii kshamta kii vajah se maang main he jo ek din main adhiktam 32 litre tak record kii ja chuki he
 The Central Buffalo Research Institute (CIRB), spread over about 1,200 acres in Hisar, is actively promoting Murrah farming as a way to revive the country's agricultural sector
 sikudti joton or krishi se ghatati aay kii ore ishaara karte hue santhaan ke nideshak inderjeet singh kehete hai, ''shaayad yahi ek tarika he
 Even the smallest farmer can easily survive by growing fodder crops with one to two acres of land and keeping two to three animals
 ''lekin haryana ke lagaataar badhate kisaanon ke liye to munaafe kaa sauda champion bhainse paalane kaa he
 Also 1 ejaculation of any such champion buffalo with established fertility
 80 lakh ru
 6 lakh to Rs
 ke bich bikta he
 For example, Karamveer sells Yuvraj's semen every year for Rs 40 to 60 lakhs
 ke bich kama lete hai, kuch-kuch bollywood ke kaalpanik viki donor kii tarah
 Each ejaculation is collected once in two weeks into the artificial vagina and it produces approximately 600 doses in special sterilized straws

 Sells at a price of Rs
 hisar main siiarabi kaa veery centre 1990 ke baad ke lagbhag har champion bhainse kaa projani tested (prajnan ke liye pareekshan se gujara) murra veery straw stock main rakhata he
 All are carefully placed in huge cryogenic compartments filled with liquid nitrogen so that their temperature is always maintained at a level of 196 ° C

 karamvir kehete hai ki june se lekar march tak bhainson ke garbhaadhan ke sijan main unke daravaaje par lambii qatari lagi rahati he
 Semen traders, breeders and farmers all stand to take the straw of Yuvraj's semen to improve his buffalo breed
 karamvir khinse niporate hue kehete hai, ''ve aksar yahaan 'karamvir kaa veery (semen)' kharidne ke liye aa khadey hote hai
 "this business is flourishing
" rajasthan main ganganagar ke ek maveshi chaara vyapaaree 30 varshiya kaalu ram ne lagbhag ek dashak pehle murra veery bechnaa shuru kiya tha
 They say that since 2010, the demand for champion buffalo semen in their area is doubling every year
 unke mutabik, ''kisaanon main ab yah baat ghar kar gai he ki agar unki bhainson kaa garbhaadhan kisi ucch gunvattta vaale bhainse se karaayaa jaae to doodh kii paidaavaar main jabardast oochaal aa jayega
 Kalu Ram sold 8,000 semen straws in Rajasthan in 2014
 amritsar ke pashchim main bharat-pakistan seemaa ke nikat mahava gaanv main ek anya veery vyapaaree 46 varshiya sakattar singh bhi murra ke veery kii badhati maang kii pushti karte hai
 In the rural areas of south and south-west Punjab, it has become common practice to give 20-25 liters of buffalo milk after conceiving with murra semen
 uski tulana main (punjab kii) sthaneey neeli ravi bhainson se adhiktam 12-16 litre doodh hi mil paata he
 a sensation spread when Yuvraj was declared the 'overall champion' at the All India Cattle Show in Meerut in October 2014
 bharat ke sabase bade veery vyapaariyon main se ek meerut ke choudhary pashu prajnan centre kii nigaah turant us par gai
 Now, Yuvraj's semen has a significant stake in this firm's stock
 yah form pashchimi uttar pradesh ke 22 jilon main har saal 20,000 murra straw bechati he
 Although no businessman wants to accept his role in this, the reality is that now semen stock of popular Haryana champion Murra buffalo is available in many buffalo growing countries
 siiarabi ke inderjeet singh kehete hai ki unhen us samay khaasi hairaani hui jab colombia kii bhens prajnak association kii adhyaksh clodia rolden kaale ne unhen soochna di ki yuvaraj ke veery kaa ek straw unke desh main 90 se 150 dollar kii keemat par uplabdh he
 Bhaleram, a 51-year-old farmer from Jugalan village in Hisar, earns more than the yield of his twenty-acre farm these days from the conception of buffalo
 do saal pehle unhone paanch saal kii ek bhens andhra pradesh ke deyari kisaan vijay kumaar ko 17 lakh ru
 Sold at an amazing price of Rs
 bhaliram kii nau bhainson main se teen is samay doodh de rahi hai or harek rojaanaa bees litre se upar doodh detii he
 But his pride is three and a half years old, which is presently from the womb of Yuvraj's semen
 is saal 18 march ko siiarabi, hisar main salanaa murra bhens meley main 333 jaanavar shaamil hue
 These included the hundred best buffaloes of this region
 isse is ilaake ke kisaanon main bhainse paalane kii badhati dilchaspee kaa sanket miltaa he
 "it was fantastic," says CIRB director Inderjit Singh
 sabase tagada muqabla to champion bhainse ke liye tha
 "on the other hand, in Sunaria, the crown prince rested comfortably on many of his achievements
 karamvir kehete hai, ''yah mere liye bhagwaan kaa tohfa he
 "they do not get tired of narrating stories about his qualities and achievements and they have lots of excuses and things to tell about his characteristics
" vah kabhi apane stall ke bheetar peshaab yaa gobar nahin karata or apana sir kapade or puaal se bane khaas takie par hi rakhata he
 The profit that comes from these animals is different, but the pride of owning a champion buffalo is a matter of a different world
 chuttee lene ke liye kabhi koi bahaane lagaataa he or kabhi koi arji daalata he
 Despite being in love with their work, employees are generally considered to be 'willing' in terms of taking and wanting to take leave
 lekin kya aapako pataa he ki china main karmchaariyon kaa ek bada hissaa ascharyajanak rup se savaitanaik avkaash (ped live) lene se inkaar kar detaa he, jabaki savaitanaik avkaash yahaan ke karmchaariyon kaa kanoonee adhikaar he
 This has been revealed in a new survey
 china ke maanav sansaadhan evam saamaajik suraksha mantralay dwaara rashtriya str par kiye gaye is surveykshan main pataa chalaa he ki china ke lagbhag 50 pratishat karmchaaree savaitanaik avkaash lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 To find out why employees do this, the People's Daily, a newspaper run by the Communist Party of China, recently interviewed employees working in various employment organizations, published on Monday as an article
 is lekh ke mutabik, sarkari sanghathanon or udhyamon main karyrat karmchaaree yah sochakar anichhaapurvak savaitanaik avkaash nahin lete ki isse unke bare main unke maalik ke man main acchhee chhavi nahin banegi, unhen aalsee samajha jayega or isse bhavishya main unki padonnati bhi prabhavit ho sakati he
 In other jobs like sales, employees do not take paid leave for small dividends
 lekh ke mutabik, savaitanaik avkaash ke liye jatil aavedan prakriya bhi aise avkaash na lene kaa ek anya kaaran he
 Liu Junhui, a law subject at Renmin University, China, believes that the salaried leave provision contained in China's labor law and employees' annual payroll leave rule should be ensured with stringent law enforcement
 iske saath hi karmchaariyon or niyoktaaon kii ore se bhi adhik protsahanpurna ravaiya apanaae jane kii jarurat he
 The comments liu ne pipuls daily ko die saakshaatkaar main kaha ki kanoon dwaara shasit kisi samaaj main karmchaariyon ko apane kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main jaagruk hona chahie, or niyoktaaon ko chahie ki ve kanoon ke mutabik, enual ped live ke adhikaar kii guarantee den
 Liu said, 'law enforcement departments in Beijing and other places have now started investigating the correct implementation of the annual paid payment system, which is a good start
 ' a nationwide survey conducted by China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security showed that nearly 50 percent of Chinese workers refuse to take paid leave
 karmchaaree aisa kyon karte hai, ise jaanane ke liye communist party of china dwaara sanchalit samachaarpatr 'pipuls daily' ne haal hi main vibhinn rojgaar sanghathanon main karyrat karmchaariyon kaa saakshaatkaar liya, jise lekh ke rup main somvaar ko prakashit kiya gaya he
 According to this article, employees working in government organizations and enterprises do not take a voluntary vacation unwillingly thinking that it will not make a good impression of their boss, they will be considered lazy and this may affect their promotion in the future
 cells jaise anya rojgaron main karmchaaree chote-chote labhaanshon ke liye ped live lete hi nahin he
 According to the article, the complex application process for paid leave is also another reason for not taking such leave
 china ke renmin vishvavidhyalay ke kanoon vishay ke professor liu junahai kaa maananaa he ki china ke shram kanoon or karmchaariyon ke vaarshik savaitanaik avkaash niyam main maujuud savaitanaik avkaash praavdhaan ko kade kanoon pravartan ke saath sunishchit kiya janaa chahie
 Along with this, there is also a need to adopt a more encouraging attitude from employees and employers
 tippaniyan Liu said in an interview to People's Daily that employees in a society governed by the law should be aware of their legal rights, and employers should, in accordance with the law, guarantee the right to an annual paid leave
 liu ne kaha, 'beijing or anya sthanon par kanoon pravartan vibhaagon ne ab vaarshik savaitanaik bhugtan pranali ke sahi kriyanvayan kii jaanch shuru kar di he, jo ek acchhee shuruyaat he
 ' is lekh ke mutabik, sarkari sanghathanon or udhyamon main karyrat karmchaaree yah sochakar anichhaapurvak savaitanaik avkaash nahin lete ki isse unke bare main unke maalik ke man main acchhee chhavi nahin banegi, unhen aalsee samajha jayega or isse bhavishya main unki padonnati bhi prabhavit ho sakati he

 While the standard of the examination has been made easier, the marks have been increased

 Yes, they have understood which answer or important word (or key word) will give them good marks

 There are only 355 (state or central) universities in India and 1,500 universities will be needed if it is to increase the gross enrollment ratio (gross Admission ratio-ger) from the present 13% to 15% by 2015

 In 2005, CBSE implemented the Higher Order Thinking Skills System or HOTS to overcome rote and textbook-centric learning
 is nai style main vishay ko dohraane or ratane kii jagah sanshleshan, vishleshan, tark-vitark, samajhne, lagu karne or akalan par jor diya jaataa he
 Though hots are a good idea, marks have increased due to short and objective questions being asked instead of long subjective questions

 Kolkata's famous South Point High School has implemented CBSE along with the state board
 principal roopa sanyaal bhattacharya kaa kahana he ki rajya bordon kaa uddeshy sibiesai kii yathasambhav barabari karnaa he
 Whether it is grading or marks, or aptitude test or board exam, it is only seen how many marks the student has scored

 This year my school has produced unexpected results, with 92 per cent of the children scoring more than 90 per cent in English

 The board's prescription does not test real education
 isamen ek tay uttar pustika ke mutabik jawaab dene kii kshamta kii hi pariksha lee jaati he
 My question to CBSE is how can one express the art or knowledge of 'answer key' expression in a subjective paper? The answer's value points do not adequately assess a student's understanding and ability
 isse keval niyam ke anusaran kii hi pariksha ho sakati he
 cbse's marking scheme was first introduced in 2003
 isamen mahaj ek shabd kaa ullekh karne ke liye ank diya jaataa he, bhale hi usamen vyakaran, hijje or abhivyakti galat hi kyon na ho
 The answer given in the quotation given with the question
 lambey sawaalon ko kai hisse main baant diya jaataa he, jisase ank batorna aasaan ho jaataa he
 Another teacher of class 12th says that even though they strictly check some answer sheets to test the real knowledge of the students, the head examiner often increases the marks
 pareekshakon ko uttar pustika jaanchane ke liye prati paper maatr 16 ru
 , Rs 20 for breakfast-water
 or kiraaya-bhaade ke liye 100 ru

 ' After DMK President MK Stalin proposed Rahul Gandhi for the Prime Minister's post against Narendra Modi, there is criticism from other opposition parties, on which this veteran leader of the South has now given his clarification
 chennai main ravivaar ko vipaksh kii ore serahul gandhika naam piem candidet ke liye prastaavit karte huediemke adhyaksh stallin kaha tha ki rahul gandhi main modi sarkaar ko haraane kii takat he or ve piem pad ke liye rahul gandhi ke naam ko prastaavit karte hai
 Although many people are supporting his proposal, a large section of the opposition is criticizing him
 apane bayaan par ab stallin ne safai dete hue bataaya ki unhone aisa kyon kaha tha
 Stalin said that projecting Rahul Gandhi for the post of Prime Minister is the right step towards keeping the secular forces united
 rahul 3 bijepi shasit rajyon main congress kii jeet ke nayak banakar ubhare hai
 He further said, 'we need a strong leadership to maintain coordination among democratic forces and that is why i proposed Rahul's name
 main is baat se aashwast hum ki hamaare sahyogi ise samajhenge
 However, when praising Rahul in Chennai and declaring him as a PM candidate, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raised her eyebrows
 tiemasi sutron ke mutabik party stallin ke is rukh se sahamat nahin he
 a Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader said that the entire opposition believes that it is not welcome to put forward any name for the post of PM
 hamane pehle bhi kaha he ki pradhanmantri kaa naam chunaav nateezon ke baad hi tay kiya jayega
 The move may have the effect of uniting opposition parties against the BJP
 tiemasi ne kaha ki congress bhi abhi kisi netaa kaa naam aage nahin badha rahi he to phir duusari partiyaan aise kadam kyon uthaa rahi he
 Apart from TMC, many leaders of various opposition parties are also against the opposition coalition's nomination for the post of Prime Minister in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vipakshi kheme ke sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 a senior opposition leader said, "many opposition leaders are against announcing someone's name as a prime ministerial candidate
" sapa, tedepa, basapa, trinmul or rakanpa stallin kii ghoshnaa se sahamat nahin he
 It is a hurry
 loksabhaa parinaamon ke baad hi pradhanmantri kaa nirnay hoga
 " North West Delhi Udit Raj has been involved in controversies, alleging that ₹ 200 was taken from street vendors in the name of forming the organization and in return it was said that no one would bother them
 maamle par udit raaj kaa kahana he ki, bijepi kaa alag color he congress kaa alag he, army kaa alag he aise main hamane rehadi patari waalo ko alag rang de diya he
 He is given a badge and a hat
 jiske badale main unase do sau rupaye liye hai
 mps say that if policemen recover from them then why not give them security
 kaha jitna man utane paise luungaa aapse kya?ajtak ke sawaalon se bijepi saansad udit raaj bhadak uthe bole ki maine ek darjan sanstha banaai he or banaaungaa
 What will i take as much money as i want? On being asked who gave the rights to the street vendor, Udit Raj said that we have not given them licenses, but have just given them their identity
 dilli police par lagaaya aarope kaha police vasuuli karti haiudit raaj ne apane bayaan main kai baar kaha ki sadak kinare baithne vaale rehadi-patari mazdooron se police paise vasuulati he aise main unki suraksha ke liye hamane unka sanghathan bana diya or unhen ek pahchaan de di
 However later when the Aaj Tak correspondent said that the government is yours, the police are under the central government, then Udit Raj went around saying that the goons of the area take money from them
 media ko acha kaam najar nahin atabijepi saansad hokar sanghathan ke naam par rehadi majdoor waalon se paise lene ko bijepi saansad ne jaij kaha bole, media ko acha kaam najar nahin aata

 maharashtra ke multiplexe main marathi filmon ko mili prime time ke baad ab swatantra cinema yaa yun kahen chote bajet kii filmon ke liye bhi filmkaaron main aarakshan kii ummid jagane lagi he
 In front of big commercial films, these films find it very difficult to find existence at the box office
 lihaaza marathi filmon par maharashtra sarkaar kii meharbaani ke baad ummiden un filmkaaron kii bhi jaagi hai jo kam bajet kii filmon or damdaar kahani par vishwaas rakhte hai
 Films like Dibakar Banerjee and Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan, well-known filmmakers, told NDTV that even low-budget good films should get screen, so they should get all the help they need
 tivi abhinayta jai bhaanushali ne bhi is muhim main shaamil hokar kaha ki aisa karne se nae nirmaataaon ko aage aane kaa mauka milegaa saath hi industry main actors ko acting ke achche maukey milenge
 About 150 Marathi films are released every year, while around 100 independent films, which have no support of big banners and big stars
 lihaaza marathi filmon ko di ja rahi tavajjo par jari aalochana ke baad dekhnaa hoga kya sarkaar is nai ummid par gaur farmaati he yaa nahin? While talking to Chetan Solanki of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, you would not think that he is a professor in the Department of Energy and Engineering
 ve aapako ek aadhyatmik samaajavigyaani zyada lagenge, jo khaskar urja kii jaruraton ke solar samaadhaan par apane tarkon se hamen lagbhag niruttar kar dete hai
 In view of his work in the field of solar energy, he is also known as 'solar Man of India'
 ''aisi technology jo maanviya vyavhaar or soch ko shuddh kar de vahi antat: sweekaarya hoti he
 The problems that have arisen due to taking science and technology as the ultimate truth are now going to new forms
 technology kaa charitra he parivartanshiltaa
 It enhances the ability to fight obstacles but remains incomplete without eternal values like peace, non-violence, compassion, compassion and friendship
 chunki ham shaashvat mulyon se bhatak gaye hai isliye technology se bhi saamanjasy baitaane main peeche chhutate ja rahe hai
 The development of spiritual qualities was also continued to take advantage of technology
 yah har samaaj ke liye jaruri he
 "solanki is on Gandhi Global Solar Tour these days
 pichley saal gandhi ji ke sabarmati ashram se shuruyaat kar ab tak 30 deshon kii yatraaen kar chuke hai
 The mission is to warn people of the risks of global warming and climate change by promoting the use of solar energy
 pichley hafte america, europe or africa deshon kii yatra se lautne or phir thailand, cambodia hote hue australia, newjiland kii ore nikalne se pehle unase hui baatcheet main unhone apane kuch anubhav saajha kiye
 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Professor Solanki wants that on 2 October, 1 million children from all over the world together make their solar lamps and prove their right to light
 ve maanate hai ki gandhi ke vichaaron ko vyavhaar main laane kaa yah acha avasar he
 The whole world needs it
 ''suraj kii roshni sabake liye he or sabko roshni kaa adhikaar he
 Using this to increase friendship with nature is also the purpose of this mission
 har bachche ko apni jarurat kii roshni milani chahie chaahe vah kisi bhi desh main rahata ho
 This is possible with solar energy technology
 ''prakruti or praudyogiki kaa mail: solanki maanate hai ki ''samaaj or prakruti ke bich dosti ko gaharaa karne vaali technology kii aaj sakht jarurat he
 We are using irresponsible technology which is proving to be violent towards nature and also careless about its ill effects
 is drushtikon se saura urja technology ko main maanavvaadi technology maanata hum
 It also expresses the idea of gandhi, the great thinker of humanity, that the earth can fulfill the needs of every human being but not of greed
 ''patibaddh netritv kii kami: solar urja technology or ''ek million solar lamp'' mishan lekar jari videsh yatraaon ke anubhavon ko saajha karte hue solanki bataate hai, ''america se lekar dakshin africa tak ek saamaanya samasya he ki technology sab chaahate hai lekin prakruti ke prati aabhaar jataane kaa tanik bhi khyaal nahin he
 Another major problem is the collision between technologies
 solar urja se bijli or roshni mil jaati he lekin air condishnar chalaakar prakruti ke prati hinsa lagaataar jari he
 Now the time has come to choose only nature friendly technology all over the world
 '' kya yah kaam sarkaron se ho saktaa he? solanki ke mutabik, ''yah sambhav nahin kyonki sarkaron ko taatkaalik parinaam chahie
 They avoid putting their energy and resources in such work which has long term results
 jaagruk logon ke naitik dabaav yaa vyavhaar parivartan se hi yah sambhav he
 Nevertheless, it is not a difficult task but every country needs committed leadership, whether it is political or scientific or social
 ''technology sakshartaa: duniya main takneekee shiksha ke sabase pratishthit sansthaanon main se ek america ke emity main gandhi global solar yatra or apane mishan par die vyaakhyaan kaa sandarbh dete hue professor solanki bataate hai ki vahaan samajhaayaa ki ''air condishnar kaa upyog karne vaala har vyakti paryaavaran ke prati hinsaatmak vyavhaar kar rahaa he
 If the hydrofluorocarbons that give the air condition cool, if left in the room, they will suffocate within minutes
 '' vyaakhyaan ke baad haal main baithe kai log air condishnar kaa upyog na karne par sahamat hote najar aae
 Solanki says that technology literacy should also go hand in hand with people so that people have a good knowledge of the qualities, demerits of any technology
 urja swaraj: madhya pradesh ke khargun jile ke chote-se bhikangaanv main ajukeshan park skool kii sthapana or ek adarsh skool bhawan banaakar professor solanki ne dikhaaya he ki prakritik urja kaa istemaal kaise hota he
 The design of this building is such that it works like a natural air conditioner
 yaheen paas ke gaanv nemit main unhone praathmik shiksha lee jahaan skool main ek shikshak or ek kaksha hoti thi
 Kerosene lamp was used here
 yahaan se nikalakar belgium ke iemaisi se piechdi or iity bombai main professor banane tak ke safar main solanki ne praudyogiki gyaan or visheshgyata ko samaaj ke hit main upyog karne kii raah pakadi or us par adig hai
 Deeply influenced by Gandhiji's personality and philosophy, Solanki is now writing a book on energy swaraj
 ve bataate hai, ''gandhi ji kii aatmakatha satya ke saath mere prayog hi kitaab kii prerana he
 The experiment with the truth of solar technology should also be written with new vision so that it becomes easier to understand
 '' unka sidhaa-sa tark he: solar technology shuddh rup se prakritik he
 Every person can easily get the energy he needs
 duniya ke har samaaj main surya ko shakti kaa pratik mana gaya he or iskaa aadar kiya jaataa he
 This gives an opportunity to understand nature, even to watch it with respect
 prakruti swayan ek vishaal praudyogiki tantra he
 It helps millions of animals to live life
 technology aakhir kaise apanaaen? iske jawaab main ve rajasthan main solar modul vaali duungarpur rinuable energy technology limited company kii sthapana kaa anubhav bataate hai ki kaise adivasee mahilaayein apni company chalaa raheen or dusron ko prashikshan de rahi hai
 He and Dungarpur district administration were honored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this initiative
 ''in mahilaon ke saamaajik vyavhaar or sochane-samajhane ke tareeke main khaasaa badlaav aayaa he
 She is also understanding nature and technology

 These were the eight days in the life of innocent Jahnavi who disappeared from India Gate, which proved to be never forgettable days
 khushkismat jahnavi apane gharavaalon ko waapas mil gai, lekin in rahasyamayi aath dinon main wo kahaan or kaise rahi? or kaise is bacchee ke gharavaalon kii tis puure hindustan kii tis ban gai? vaardaat main baat un harek din ke ek-ek chaunkaane vaale sach kii
 In fact, Ahuja family living in Raghubiranagar, Delhi went to India Gate on 28th of September, i
e
 on Sunday evening
 lekin ye raat ke koi 9
 It must have been 15 o'clock, when the family members of Jahnavi suddenly realized that their beloved is no longer with them
 jaahir he, kaleje ke tukade kaa yun achaanak gaayab ho janaa ahuja parivaar ke liye kisi sadame se kam nahin tha
 He kept searching for Jahnavi like crazy and searched the India Gate
 lekin nateeja sifer
 Defeated, the family members of Jahnavi complained to the police and the police registered a report in this regard and started investigating
 lekin isi silsile main jab police ne india get ke aas-paas lage sisitivi camaron ke footage khangale, to usamen jahnavi kii ek chaunkaanewaali tasviir najar ai
 Because in these pictures, Jahnavi was seen moving away from her family and after that she went out of the camera range
 aise main jahnavi ko koun or kis taraf uthaa le gaya, iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin tha
 How could the parents' heart sit silently? Obviously, in these circumstances even the police could not do anything by wishing
 lekin maa-baap kaa dil aakhir chup kaise baithta? so, ahuja parivaar ne jahnavi kii talash main ek aisi muhim kii shuruyaat kii, jo chand roj raghubir nagar ke is ghar se baahar nikal kar puure hindustan kii muhim ban gai
 a campaign behind which neither a political party was involved nor any big company money
 lekin soshal media or phir media kii koshishon ne jaise is muhim ko pankh laga die
 Jahnavi's pictures have now gone viral on whatsapp and Facebook
 do din guzarate-guzarate jahnavi kii ek nahin, balki kai tasviren
 Everyone had reached home through smartphone and television
 or shaayad soshal media or media kaa hi kamaal tha ki jahnavi se anjaan hone ke baavjood karodon log khud ko jahnavi se judaa hua mahasoos karne lage
 Somewhere in every heart, the disappearance of Jahnavi was born
 or kahin naa kahin har shaks ye chaahane laga ki jaise bhi ho jahnavi jald se jald apane ghar laut aae
 It was the wonder of the media that yesterday's anonymous Jahnavi now came to know the whole world
 or ye media kaa hi kamaal tha, jisane kahin naa kahin har dil main jahnavi ke gaayab hone kii tis paidaa kar di
 Everyone now began to wish that whatever his family, Jahnavi could get back to his family
 lekin ye kaam itnaa aasaan bhi nahin tha
 But the story of these seven days of Jahnavi's disappearance and meeting was no less shocking
 aasaan nahin thi police kii raahtin saal kii maasoom jahnavi jin haalat main gaayab hui thi, usase itnaa to saaf tha ki ye bacchee akele apane dam par kahin nahin gai
 Rather, his disappearance from a crowded and high security place like India Gate was enough to prove that Jahnavi was picked up from the spot
 jaahir he, jisane bhi aisa kiya wo kisi bhi surat main naa to jahnavi ko waapas lautaanaa chahta tha or naa hi ye bhed khulne dena or yahi wo baaten thim, jisane police kaa kaam or bhi mushkil kar diya
 Police registered a report of Jahnavi's disappearance and started searching for him
 india get kii tamaam sisitivi footage se lekar puraa ilaaka chaan maaraa
 On one hand, while the police printed leaflets in search of her and got them installed in all the police stations and residential areas of Delhi, on the other hand, the search for this girl was started by making five different teams
 udhar, log maasoom jahnavi kii talash main soshal media par apni muhim lagaataar tej kar rahe the
 But Jahnavi had no clue
 trek da missing childrepub tak police ne jahnavi ke gumshudagi kii soochna nodel agency yani sibiai samet trek da missing children jaisi kai websites main bhi daal di thi
 Since the housemates had told the police about going to the Gurudwara Bangla Sahib before coming to India Gate, the police also found Jahnavi around all the Gurudwaras including the Bangla Sahib
 magar, nateeja kuch bhi nahin niklaa
 Hearing that there was no clue from the CCTV, the spirits of the families had started to weaken
 lekin unhone ummid kaa daaman nahin choda
 And after social media, now the media started raising the voice of the family members of Jahnavi
 idhar, jahnavi ke naa milane se gharavaale lagaataar police kii shikaayat karne lage the
 On the other hand, in view of the exaggeration of the police case, the girl was busy searching for her life
 or to or dilli police ne apane super cops kii team yani special cell or krime branch ko bhi jahnavi kii talash main laga diya
 The police started insisting on developing intelligence
 lekin is roj bhi koi suraag nahin mila
 The police returned the people who had come to protest
 Now the patience of the family members started responding
 lihaaja, unhone police par dabaav banane ke liye ek baar phir se usee india get par pradarshan karne kaa faisla kiya, jahaan se chah roj pehle jahnavi gaayab hui thi
 But the people who came to march candle light were returned by the police from India Gate
 is maasoom kii gumshudagi kaa ye saatvaan din bhi intjaar main guzar gaya
 But its next day proved to be the most important and special day of this story
 ek taraf jahaan police ne jahnavi ke bare main suraag dene vaale ko 50 hajaar kaa inam dene kaa elaan kar ye jataa diya ki wo bacchee ko talashne ko lekar kitni gambhir he, vahiin raat ke aath bajte-bajte jahnavi ko lekar jo khabar saamne ai, usne ek baar phir se sabhi ko chaunkaa diya
 This was the news that Jahnavi was reunited
 ji haa, ab jahnavi waapas mil chuki thi
 But where? How are you? And who left him? The police were yet to find answers to these questions
 lekin gharavaalon se milakar maanon jahnavi or uske gharavaale donon kii jaan main jaan laut ai

 christmas ke din jab puraa desh jashn manaa rahaa tha
 On the same day in Delhi's Sarojini Nagar area, three youths committed a shameful gang-rape incident with a 19-year-old girl
 vaardaat kii jaankaree police ko khudpeedit ladkine 100 nambar par kol karke di
 The girl told the police that she was trying her luck in the modeling world
 kareeb do maheene pehle wo isi silsile main mumbai gai thi
 There he met a boy named Satish from Delhi
 satish ne ladki se kaha ki uski dilli main acchhee jaan pahchaan he
 If the girl moves to Delhi, then she can meet him with a director there
 ladki aaropee satish ke jhaanse main aa gai
 The girl came to Delhi and started living here in Jamia Nagar
 ladki kaa aarope he ki pichley 15 dinon se satish ladki ko kahin naa kahin ghuma rahaa tha
 a day before Christmas, on 24, the accused called the victim and called her to a big mall in South Delhi
 vahaan par satish ke saath jaggi naam kaa uskaa dost bhi tha
 Everyone partyed in the mall and after that Satish took the girl to a flat in Sarojini Nagar area
 vahaan par harendra naam kaa uskaa ek dost pehle se tha
 It is alleged that the three nerds with the girl fed some narcotics here
 25 kii raat ko jab ladki ko puri tarah se hosh aayaa to usne tunrat 100 nambar par phone kar diya
 The police immediately reached the spot and took the accused Satish and Jaggi into custody from there
 baad main medical main rape kii pushti ke baad police ne gangrape kii dhara ke tahat exias darj kar donon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 Harendra is still absconding
 publicity ke liye netaa kya tak karte hai, isaki ek baangi tab dikhi, jababijepi kii netaa vaani treepathine haadase kii ek ghatana par jamkar bavaal machaaya
 But Aaj Tak has the document that opened up the voice of speech
 dilli main rashtriya party kii kaddavar mahila netaa se badasluki or chhedchhad
 Can't believe hearing this, but BJP National Secretary Vani Tripathi has blamed the same on 5 boys
 dilli me rahanevaali bijepi kii rashtriya sachiv vaani treepathi kaa aarope he ki jab wo guuruuvaar kii raat kareeb 9 bajkar 30 minute par dilli ke greater kailash part 2 ke ilaake se apni car main guzar rahi thi to unki gaadi ko ek esayuvi ne peeche se takkar maar di
 About 4-5 people were sitting in that car and they were also drunk
 baad main virodh karne par un logon ne vaani se naa sirf badasluki kii balki chhedchhad karne kii koshish bhi kii
 Allegations of misconduct and that too with the BJP national secretary
 jaahir he thodi hi der main hangaamaa much gaya
 But there is another aspect of the matter
 badasluki ke aaropee ladakon kaa kahana he ki ye sirf ek chote se road accidate kaa maamla he jisamen galati bhi vaani treepathi kii he
 Despite this, he gave Rs 15 thousand to Vani Tripathi and a written agreement was also reached at CR Park police station
 jis par vaani treepathi ke dastakhat hai baavjood iske wo galatabayani kar rahi he
 The questions of the accused can also be valid because when Vani Tripani had secured Rs 15,000 under the agreement then why did he cry so much later
 agar ladakon ne sangeen gunaah kiya tha to phir paise lekar vaani kyon maan gayi
 Whatever be the truth, but both sides have their own arguments in this matter
 lihaaja police bhi is maamle main jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahati or jaanch karne ke baad maamla darj karne kii baat kah rahi he

 inhen ke chalate nagaur jat raajnneeti kaa siyaasi centre bana
 The political hank of the Mirdha family can be gauged from the fact that when the Congress was wiped out of North India after the Emergency, the Congress won 26 of the 42 seats in Marwar in the Assembly elections
 ab yahaan ke jat netaa hanuman beniwal bijepi ke khilaaf morcha khole hue hai
 They are going to Jat dominated areas and are organizing public meetings and trying to unite all Jats

 On the uproar of the opposition party in the Rajya Sabha, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says that the double face of the Congress has once again surfaced
 congress party nahin chaahati he ki hamaari musalmaan bahanon or betiyon ko izzat mili or teen talaak se mukti mili
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that i ask him through the media why he has one form in Lok Sabha and another in Rajya Sabha on triple talaq
 aisa nahin chalegaa
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that we had a majority in the Lok Sabha, so he passed the bill there
 rajyasabha main hamaara number kam he to yahaan virodh kar diya
 This is the real face of Congress
 desh ne congress kaa asli cheharaa dekh liya he
 The Congress heartily does not want Muslim women to get justice or justice
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha lok sabha se bill paas hone ke baavjood ho rahaa hetripal talaak
 If there is support in Lok Sabha then why protest in Rajya Sabha darrlas, congress bill ko salect cameti main bhejne par ada hua he
 On this, Arun Jaitley said that notice has to be given 24 hours in advance for rectification
 desh main 70 saal ke baad narendra modi sarkaar ne muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak kii barbarta se aazaadee dilaane kii himmat dikhaai he
 But the Congress party is doing vote bank politics
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne is avasar par kaha ki muslim mahilaon ko nyaay dene kaa kaam modi sarkaar ne kiya he
 The honor of Muslim women is justice for the Modi government
 teen talaak ko lekar kanoon jarur banegaa
 The policies of a party like Congress have come to the fore
 teen talaak bill ke saath yah baat to spasht ho gai ki koun si party muslim mahilaon ke saath khadi he or koun si nahin
 This will not only affect Muslim women, but the entire society
 aaj congress kis prakaar se vot bank politics ke naam par desh ke saath dhokhaa kar rahi he
 It is working to divide the people of the country
 aage kii ranneeti par kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki kal phir rajyasabha main apni baat kahenge
 Ravi Shankar Prasad told the team till date that till success is achieved, we will keep trying
 ishrat jahaan ke parivaar ne jaan ko khatra hone kii baat kahi he
 At a press conference in Mumbai today, Ishrat's sister has said that she is being intimidated
 unke ghar ke neeche ek pulisavaale ko tainaat kiya he, jisane raat main 2 baje uthakar unka haal poocha yani suraksha dene ke naam par hi unhen daraaya ja rahaa he
 The comments ishrat ke chachaa rauf lala kaa kahana he ki 2011 se hi unhen daraane yaa maarane kii koshish ho rahi he
 a similar attempt took place in the month of June
 ishrat kii bahan ne grahamantri ko chitthee likhakar suraksha kii maang bhi kii he
 Here, when the Home Minister was asked about this, he said that if the family of Ishrat demanded protection, they would be given security

 6 India is considering every option to give a befitting reply to the nefarious activities of Pakistan
 bharat sindhu nadi ke pani kii samiksha kar saktaa he
 For this, PM Modi has taken a meeting of officials of Ministry of Water Resources and External Affairs on Monday
 baithak main is samjhaute ke phaayde-nuksaan par charchaa kii gai he
 However, what has been decided on this issue is not yet known
 visheshgyon kii raay- turant samjhauta radd kare bharatvidesh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne jis tarahasindhu jal samjhautaradd karne ke sanket die visheshgyon se lekar raajnneetik galiyaaron tak ne is bayaan kaa swaagat kiya, kyonki agar bharat ye kadam uthaata he to pakistan ke ek bade hisse ke logon ko ek-ek boond pani ke liye tarasna pad saktaa he
 Foreign affairs expert Brahmachelani believes that India should cancel the Indus River Water Agreement of 1960 without wasting any time, because it will turn a large area of pakistan into a desert
 sindhu nadijammu-kashmirase hokar pakistan main bahati he
 If the Indus river water agreement is canceled by India, the water of the Indus river given to Pakistan will be stopped
 sindhu nadi ko pakistan kii jivan rekha kaha jaataa he
 Pakistan's irrigation system and farming rests on the Indus River itself
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main brahmachelani ne kaha ki jis tarah china kisi tarah kii jal sandhi main yakeen nahin karata or bharat se judati nadiyon sutluj or brahmaputra se man mutabik pani letaa he, usee tarah bharat ko bina raham barte us pakistan ke saath sandhi tod leni chahie, jo saalon se bina ruke bharat ke saath proxi yuddh lard rahaa he
 Water from Ravi and Jhelum will also be stopped! Significantly, in 1948, India stopped the waters of the Indus River a few months after the partition of the two countries
 iske liye pakistan ko 1953-1960 tak mehnat kerani padi
 The Indus River Water Agreement was signed with India on 19 September 1960 after years of pandering to Pakistan
 tab se ab tak pakistan is pani ko dhadlle se istemaal kar rahaa he
 Even more worrying for Pakistan is that the Ravi and Jhelum rivers also pass through India to the Punjab province of Pakistan
 agar sindhu nadi jal samjhauta radd hua to raavi or jhelum nadiyon kaa pani bhi roka ja saktaa he
 Due to this, Pakistan's agricultural system will collapse

 Nandana Sen, who has been touring these three continents, India, England and America, has returned to India for the promotion of 'rang Rasiya'
 nandana film ko mil rahe rispons se behad khush hai
 Apart from acting, Nandana, who was involved in writing for children, was a special inspiration for Raja Ravi Varma, who portrayed her as a goddess
 aapke liye sugandha kya he?sugandha sirf raja ravi verma kii kala nahin thi balki vah unka pyaar thi
 Sugandha, despite being a devadasi, was so pious that King Ravi Varma had divine qualities in him
 uski aantarik khubsuurati or vishwaas se bhari maasoomiyat uske gun the
 Despite all this, Sugandha was an ordinary girl who was passionate and empowered, hungry for love and ready to offer herself to a man she loves dearly
 sugandha, kaamuktha or paralaukikta kaa khubasurat mishran thi
 How did you prepare for Sugandha? Paintings of Raja Ravi Varma proved to be most helpful to me
 apni nayikaon kaa shaareerik chithran unhone kaaphi khubsuurati se kiya he
 The way she stands, the way she is playing with her hands, the way she sees her eyelashes, all these things are worth watching
 raja ravi verma ne apni nayikaon ko kaaphi khubasurat or aakarshak chitrit kiya he
 i read all the books related to Raja Ravi Varma, so that i can understand Sugandha's life very well
 sugandha devdasi thi so maine devdasi pratha se sambandhit bhi kuch pustaken padhin
 i used to wear a Navwari saree all day to mold myself in this role
 yahaan tak kii usee libaas main maine siddhivinayak mandir ke saath film ‘spiderman’ jaakar dekhi, jo usee dauraan release hui thi
 Also reconsidered all the classical heroines, Shakuntala, Damayanti, Urvashi etc
 as Sugandha was a cultured Indian woman despite being a Devadasi
 randeep ke saath kaam karne kaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa?mujhe khushi he ki rang rasiyaa ke madhyam se maine or randeep hooda ke saath kaam kiya
 i can say with certainty that no one else could play this character better than Randeep
 kabhi kabhi kuch muddon ko lekar ham main aapasi matbhed ho jaaya karte the magar main puuchhati hum kin vichaarsheel logon ke bich matbhed nahin hote
 The important thing is that despite these differences, we did our work honestly
 is film se judaa koi yaadgaar lamhaa?mere liye puri film hi yaadgaar lamhaa he magar sugandha ke kirdaar ko jeena mere jivan ke liye yaadgaar lamhaa ban chukaa he
 However, there was a tremendous accident during the film
 randeep ke saath ek dance seqvence ke dauraan mere pair main moch aa gai thi
 It was not even a wound that a set fire broke out during a scene
 bhagwaan kaa shukr he isamen koi hataahat nahin hua in donon durghatnaon ke baavjood hamane shooting jari rakhi, us dauraan mere pairon main kaaphi dard tha
 Your father and husband John mckinson watched 'rang Rasiya'? Yes both of them have seen this film
 jon jahaan england, neuyork or landan main apane doston ke liye screenings arange karne main jute hai vahiin papa ko mujh par garv he
 i remember i had talked to him about my character for hours before signing this film, so when he saw this film, he said, 'more than this character, i am proud of your performance
 mujhe khushi he tumne sahi samay par ek sahi faisla liya
 Apart from this, he also thanked Ketan Sir many times that he made a politically important and society related film
 film main dikhaae gaye neude seens ko mili sensor board kii rajamandi ke silsile main kya kahana chahengi?mujhe yah jaanakar jaraa bhi aashcharya nahin hua ki film ke neude seen ko sensor kii rajamandi mil gai he
 That scene of the film is the focal point of the film and he knows this very well
 film main maujuud rajnatik sandesh tathaa bhavuk naatakeeyata isi drishy ke aas paas gumti he, jise bayaan karnaa bahut jaruri he
 So far people have not seen this film, so they are considering this scene as a scene based on a love affair
 is seen ke jariye ek kalakaar apni kala kaa srijan karata he
 Without this scene narrated from the point of view of the artist, not only the originality of our film would have been questioned, but the entire film itself would have been incomplete
 jisane bhi yah film dekhi he un sabhi ke anusaar yah seen kaaphi khubsuurati se filmaaya gaya he
 i am happy that the censor board also saw this film as a true audience
 is drishy ke liye randeep ne kitna sahaj kiya?is film par maine puure 100 pratishat vishwaas kiya tha magar is kirdaar ko nibhaane kaa faisla lenaa mere liye kaaphi mushkil tha kyonki vyaktigat rup se main kaaphi privet tathaa sharmili ladki hum
 My family played a bigger role than Randeep in adopting and playing this character
 mere mata pita ko laga is drishy par prashnchinh lagaana, kahani par prashnchinh lagane jaisi baat he
 They too agreed that without it the film would not be realistic and impressive
 jab maine yah seen kiya tab main puri tarah apane kirdaar main thi
 Then i was not a shy girl Nandana but Sugandha who broke all the rules of her time
 aapane 130 saal purana charitra jiyaa he
 Also played a very big role in making that era come on screen
 us yug ke bare main, vishesh rup se mahilaon ke bare main kya kahana chahengi?mujhe dukh he aarthik or saamaajik drushti se viksit hone ke baavjood aaj bhi hamaare samaaj main kuch buraaiyaan hai jo us yug main thi
 In that era, Sugandha and Raja Ravi Varma were brought to court and prosecuted because they depicted the face of a devadasi as a goddess
 yah baat thik usee tarah he jaisaa ki is film main devi lakshmi ke chitra main mere chehre ko chitrit karne ko lekar akhbaar main ek vivaad maine padhaa tha
 It is absolutely true that in this film my face is depicted not only as Lakshmi but also as Mother Saraswati, Manika, Sita, Draupadi and Urvashi
 main khud ek dharmik insaan hum or main nahin chaahati ki main kisi kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaaun
 But i do not see any difference in the dispute between us
 agar 130 saal puraani ghatana aaj bhi doharaai ja rahi he to hamane itane saalon main kya vikaas kiya? Asaduddin Owaisi said - All parties should get full time
 SC asked to end debate in the dispute by October 18 Deadline has been set to end in the Supreme Court debate on the Ayodhya land dispute
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne tamaam pakshon se kah diya he ki ayodhya vivaad main bahes 18 oktober tak khatm kar lee jaaegi
 On this, All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that all sides should get full time
 sunwaayee ke saath-saath madhyasthata ke court ke aadesh par asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki yah chitthee li kaise ho gai
 i do not understand the game of letter
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or shivasena ko kaise pataa ki unke paksh main faisla aayega
 The hearing is still going on
 bijepi, shivasena nahin, supreme court faisla sunayegi or hamen us par puraa bharosa he
 Asaduddin Owaisi said that every party should have the right to present its case
 ve apane paksh rakh rahe hai
 He further said what could be my answer
 supreme court ne khud hi 18 oktober kii dedline tay kar di he
 All debates must be completed
 isi par faisla diya jayega
 On Shiv Sena's comment, Owaisi said that assembly elections are coming in Maharashtra
 unke paas chunaav main ladane ke liye kuch nahin he, aise main ve is maamle kaa mahaj apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kar rahe hai
 KC Tyagi said- Soon to be decided, on the decision of the Supreme Court, KC Tyagi said that everybody wanted that the matter should be resolved by mutual talk
 doosraa rasta court kaa he
 All parties were ready for early hearing
 unhone kaha ki court ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hai
 We hope that the decision will be valid for all sections of society
 ram mandir banane ke bijepi netaaon ke daawey par kisi tyaagi ne kaha ki yah adaalat ke andar chal rahi karrwai main rukaawat daalane kii koshish he
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the court's decision should be awaited, then why is there such readiness, it is beyond comprehension
 sabhi ko apane-apane paksh main apni baat kehane kaa adhikaar he
 The matter is very old, so it will be good if the decision comes soon

 iske baad 15 minute tak chale samvaad main 43 varshiya akhilesh ne vidhansabha chunaav se paanch maah pehle apni party ke bhavishya ke bare main vistaar se baat kii
 With humility as a well-wisher, he called Rahul Gandhi a "good boy" on a padyatra in the state, although the Congress vice-president is three years older than him
 iske baad unhone maamle ko or jatil banaate hue kah daalaa ki rahul gandhi agar rajya main zyada vakt den or donon ke bich or zyada mulaakaaten hon, to shaayad ve ''achche dost" ban sakate hai
 Akhilesh Yadav, who laid the foundation for six huge developmental projects that are being prepared at full speed waiting for the public to start before the elections, was at the peak of his power while saying so — politically cautious and expressing himself in this manner Happened as the people of the state had long wanted
 vipakshi dal apane kisi netaa ko ab tak saamne nahin laa sake the or aisa koi agenda pesh nahin kar sake the jiske peeche janata chal de, aise main us dopaher kaman akhilesh ke haath main dikhti thi sivaae unki sarkaar ke kanoon vyavastha se jude record ke jo unki raah kaa iklauta roda bana hua tha
 Barely two weeks later, the Chief Minister of the most populous state in India has been turned into a puppet at the hands of his own enemy, the Samajwadi Party and his estranged father, and is forced to dance at his fingertips
 aisa lagata he ki 76 varshiya mulaayam singh yadav ke dimag main yah baat ghar kar gai he ki akhilesh ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party agar paanch siton par nahin simat gai hoti, to ve bharat ke pradhanmantri ban sakate the
 They are now repeating this thing in front of their visitors
 nateeja yah hua he ki akhilesh ek baar phir bas naam ke mukhyamantri rah gaye hai—yahi vah dharna thi jise jhatakkar utaar phenkane kii koshish ve beete dedh saal se kar rahe the
 The party is now completely under the control of Mulayam whom Amar Singh, who has re-emerged in the party, is giving air
 akhilesh kii bhashaa main vah ''bahari" jisaki mejabani main 11 sitambar ko dilli main di gai daavat party ke maujuuda sankat kaa bis bani thi
 Shivpal Singh Yadav, Mulayam's youngest brother and 61-year-old uncle of Akhilesh, emerged during this period as a strong antagonist of Akhilesh in this recent family drama
 unhen ab akhilesh kii jagah rajya main party kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya he
 The controversial mining minister Gayatri Prajapati, who was removed by Akhilesh from his post due to allegations of corruption, has also been reinstated
 mulaayam ke chachere bhai or party ke mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ko chhod den to chachaa-bhatijon kii samoochee fouj aaj shivpal ke peeche majbootee se khadi he
 This is happening at a time when the ticket sharing process for the elections is about to begin
 akhilesh ko bas do chizon se santosh karnaa hoga—ek shivpal ko malaaidaar mantralay peedblyoody se hataanaa or doosraa rajya ke daagdar purv mukhya sachiv deepak singhl ko darkinar karnaa
 As one party worker said, "the message is clear - if you are standing with brother, then understand, you are standing against the party
" "pichley do hafton ke dauraan jo kuch gata he or mulaayam ne jis tareeke se saarvajanik rup se apane bete ko latada he, uskaa isse behatar sankshipt nishkarsh or kuch nahin ho saktaa (dekhen graphich mukhyamantri kaa ghatata kad)
 On September 17 at the party headquarters in Lucknow, Mulayam said angrily to the workers, "if Akhilesh is unhappy about making Shivpal the head of the SP in the state, he should remember that the public accepted him as the chief minister
 Is because they are my sons
 raajnneeti main unka koi apana kad nahin tha
 "political suicides
 The irony of this entire development is that if the decisions were not reversed for Akhilesh, the SP would have helped a lot in the coming elections
" pehali baat, prajapati ko pad se hataane ke peeche rajya main hue kathith khanan ghotaale kii sibiai jaanch sambandhi aadesh kaa elahabaad hycourt kaa pusht kiya janaa tha
 Singhal was removed because he was engaged in a dangerous manipulation with Amar Singh
 amar singh ne 11 sitambar ko dilli main ek party di thi
 Akhilesh refused to go into it but Singhal went there
 vahaan halaki-fulki baatcheet dhire-dhire akhilesh kaa majaak udaane tak pahunch gai jisamen singhl bhi saharsha bhagidaar the
 This matter reached Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne shuru main hi singhl kii niyukti kaa virodh is aadhaar par kiya tha ki unki chhavi ek dalal kii thi (unhen centre ne kendriya rasayan or urvarak mantralay se bhashtachar ke aaropon kii vajah se rajya main bhej diya tha)
 Akhilesh decided to sack Singhal immediately
 akhilesh ko laga tha ki party or janata, donon in faislon se khush hogi tathaa chunaav ke pehle saaf-suthri chhavi kaayam karne main yah kaam aayega, lekin hua iskaa ulataa
 Prajapati's proximity to Mulayam and Singhal's close association with Amar Singh and Shivpal led the big leaders to persuade Mulayam that the young chief minister's head had lost the success and success of his development projects
 in faislon se gusse main aae mulaayam ne akhilesh ko pehle rajya main party ke adhyaksh pad se hataaya or phir yah jimmedaari shivpal ko saunp di
 Akhilesh in turn removed Shivpal from the ministers, after which a series of events took place which caused Akhilesh's embarrassment
 ab shivpal waapas satta main hai, to ve akhilesh ke samarthakon ke peeche pad gaye hai
 Seven SP activists have been expelled from the party for demonstrating on the road in support of Akhilesh last week
 party kii chaatr or yuva ikai ke jo sadsy akhilesh samarthak hai, unhen chetavanee di gai he ki un par bhi karrwai ho sakati he
 "instead of using us before the election, the party has decided to target us only," says a young leader
 yah to rajnatik khudakushi he
 They are cutting their nose to make the face beautiful
 "plan bi nahimulaayam chaahe jo sochate hon, lekin samaajawaadee party ke liye khule main chali yah bhitari jang kaaphi nuksandaayak he
 Mulayam has held the reins of the state thrice and Akhilesh has established himself as a fresh option due to the way he has stepped forward in the last year and a half
 apane latoomaar pita ke bainks unhen sanjay vyakti ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha; apane kathith rup se bhrasht chaachaaon ke mukaable unhen saaf-suthra samajha ja rahaa tha
 People were looking at him as a person who, if freed from the shackles of family, has the potential to be a carrier of change
 ab akhilesh kaa cheharaa agali qatari main nahin hoga to sapa ko ek vishwasaneey cheharaa khojna bhi baari pad jayega
 The Samajwadi Party has given a chance to other parties by cutting its own cast
 ve iskaa dohan karenge
 Mayawati's BSP will use this opportunity to win the hearts of Muslims
 congress kii koshish hogi ki vah ek ''yuva pratik" kii jagah duusare ko sthapit kare or use ummid he ki akhilesh yadav ke vot rahul gandhi ke paas chale aaen
 The BJP needs sp's backward vote bank so that it can organize Hindu votes as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 isliye vah yadav voton ke ek hisse main send lagaaegi
 If the Samajwadi Party had to pay the cost of all this in the end, the worst defeat would be of Akhilesh
 paanch saal satta se baahar rahane ke baad sapa haashie par chali jaaegi, khaskar isliye bhi kyonki mulaayam kii sehat thik nahin he
 Akhilesh is still not able to emerge as his only heir, so being out of power could harm his political future forever
 yahi vajah thi ki akhilesh lagaataar ek samanaantar vichaar ko moort rup dene main jute hue the
 Over the past year, he has tried to elevate himself as Vikas Purush and to strengthen this image he had six huge projects — delhi-lucknow Expressway, State Highway connecting 44 districts, Cancer Hospital, Lucknow Metro, International Cricket Stadium and IT City
 akhilesh ko ummid thi ki is saal ke ant tak shuru ho jane vaali ye sabhi pariyojnaayen unki agragami soch ko pradarshit karengi
 During the first three years of his reign, he had tried to balance the allegations of law, corruption and Yadavism with his personal personality, but before the election he was on the way to establish his credibility that on the occasion, internal infighting Dashed their prospects
 akhilesh kii samasya yah he ki unke paas koi vaikalpik yojana nahin he
 He has neither worked nor spent time with party workers to establish himself as a grassroots leader
 asli vaaris ke rup main pahchaan ke liye unhen ab bhi mulaayam kii darkaar he, to satta main waapas aane ke liye jaruri soshal ejineering kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye unhen shivpal ke santhnik kaushal kii bhi jarurat he
 Since Mulayam has suddenly become angry with Akhilesh, Akhilesh is saying this because he has no hold on the party despite being the chief minister for more than four years
 yahi baat unhen ab daraane lagi he
 At the same time, Akhilesh was preparing himself to stop the advancing forces of BJP, BSP and Congress, at the same time his own family knocked him out
 samaajawaadee party ko iskaa jawaab dena hoga ki akhilesh ko nishaanaa banaakar kahin vah apni kabr to nahin khod rahi he? These days there is a ruckus on the issue of Rohingya Muslims all over the country
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama daayar kar kaha he ki rohingya sharnaarthi nahin ghuspaithiye hai or desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra he
 Therefore, he cannot come to India
 lekin isse itar gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay rupani kaa bhi myanmar (burma) se naata he

 During that time there was a political upheaval in Burma, and that is why the Rupani family left Burma

 Government's stance is tough: The central government's stance on Rohingya issue has been very strong so far
 samay-samay par kendriya mantriyon ne rohingya ke bharat main aane kaa virodh kiya he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday that the Rohingya are not refugees, they have not come to India as refugees
 rajnath ne kaha, ''centre sarkaar ko desh kii suraksha ke anusaar faisla lene kaa adhikaar he
 "what does the central government's affidavit say? a 16-page affidavit was filed by the central government on September 18 on a plan to send Rohingya Muslims back to Myanmar
" is halphaname main centre ne kaha ki kuch rohigya sharnaarthiyon ke pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathanon se sampark kaa pataa chalaa he
 In such a situation, they can prove to be a threat to national security
 centre ne apane halafname main saath hi kaha, 'jammu, dilli, hyderabad or mevaat main sakriy rohingya sharnaarthiyon ke aatanki conection hone kii bhi khufia soochna mili he
 At the same time, some Rohingya were found involved in various illegal and anti-india activities including money laundering and hawala money
 'kya kehete hai aankaden?grih mantralay ke mutabik, vaid taur par 14 hajaar se zyada rohingya sharnaarthi bharat main rah rahe hai

 vahiin sanyukt raashtra ke anusaar, myanmar ke rakhin praant main hinsa ke kaaran 3,79,00 se adhik rohingya muslim bhagkar bangladesh pahunch chuke hai
 However, India has also started sending help to the refugees present in Bangladesh
 kyon myanmar se bhaag rahe hai rohingya?gauratlab he ki rohingya muslimon par myanmar main atyaachaar ho rahaa he
 Their houses are being burnt by the government, which is strongly condemned
 myanmar kii state counslar ang saan su chi ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki rohingya muslim aatanki hamalon main shaamil rahe hai, vah desh ke liye khatra hai

 tippaniyan Players and officials intervened khilaadiyon-adhikariyon ne kiya bich-bachaav i met Bhuduknath Baba in April 2013 in Kusmaha, a small village in Faizabad
 koi 22-23 varshiya baba ke darbar main saikadon log sir jhukaae khadey the
 Some chickens were donating their cows to them
 bhakton se mili daan se baba saikadon gaayon or murgiyon ke maalik ban chuke the
 He had acquired this property within barely a week
 faijabad ke jis gaanv main jaao vahiin bhudaknath ke chamatkaar ke charche chal rahe the
 Some say that incurable diseases are overcome by Baba's touch
 koi kahata baba jise najar bhar dekh len uski jindagi se dukhon kii kudrushti khatm ho jaati he
 Moreover, Baba was adept at curing ghosts
 to maine sochaa kyon na ek baar is jaadui baba ke chamatkaar ko ham bhi apni ankhon se dekhen
 Sitting with a lamp of 51 ghee in the room of eight by ten, Baba covered himself with a dhoti
 haalanki kamare ke ek kone main baba kaa bermuda or tishart bhi tangi thi
 Rabbits and peacocks were running around in that room
 log vahaan aate or baba unhen kuch pine ko dete or kehete jaao ab tumhe dukh kii chaaya chhu bhi nahin paaegi
 The devotee gets overwhelmed and goes out, chanting Baba
 meri jigyaasa badhati gai ki bhala is kaadhe main aisa kya he jo maansik or shaareerik donon kashton ko ek pal main har letaa he
 i asked about the ingredients of decoction
 baba ne kaha, himalay kii jadi bootiyaan hai
 i said, please tell the names of those herbs so that people of other districts away from Faizabad can also be benefited
 baba ne ghuraa or kaha ‘durlabh’ jadi-bootiyaan sabko nahin milteen
 The devotees of Baba warned me that if i ask more questions, the result will be bad
 do minute kii chuppi ke baad maine baba se phir poocha, itani murgiyaan or gaayon kaa kya karenge? baba ne kaha ham dhan ekatrit kar rahe hai
 a temple of Shiva is to be built in Scooter city of Lucknow
 adbhut! ek taraf ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan karne kaa sankalp bhakton ne kar rakhaa tha to duusari taraf bhudaknath shivmandir banavaane ke liye kritasankalp the
 With these questions, not only Baba, but also the mercury of the devotees was increasing
 maine kaha kshamaa chaahati hum baba lekin shivmandir hi kyon? unhone bada ajeeb kissa bataaya
 Listen, once in Lucknow a snake bitten me, but then a cow came and licked me and i survived
 baba ne is kaatane-chaatane ke prakaran kii photo bhi dikhaai
 Now i took a huge risk and asked Baba, when this incident happened, where was the camera clicked at that time
 maine thod ghabaraate hue kaha, baba bas sahaj jigyaasa he
 Baba said, i had a dream at night, so i gave this news to my friends
 ab vahiin se media ke logon ko pataa chal gaya hoga
 When he came out, he wanted to know from the people, what is his information about Baba? Ask whomever he would say, it is not his ability to say anything about Baba
 baba koun hai ye to ishwar hi jaane
 God has just sent Baba to overcome our suffering
 log bina baba kaa becoground jane unke charnon main paisa, jaanavar, anaaj or yahaan tak jameen kaa kuch tukdaa bhi bhent kar rahe the
 At one time, every other person used to narrate the same miracle of 'nirmal Baba' in Central UP
 bhudukanath to rajya stareey yaa kahen rajya ke kuch hisson main mashhoor hue the lekin nirmal baba kii prasiddhi to uttar bharat ke kai rajyon main fail gai thi
 While praising Nirmal Baba, some would say his son had passed the IIT examination and some would have said that his daughter had taken out MBBS
 kisi kii naukari lag gai to kisi kii beti kii shaadi ho gai baba ke asharvaad se
 And listen to Baba's tricks

 Gurukul Kangri Professor C
 pi khokhar bataate hai
 "miraculous stories not only attract ordinary people, but also provide a relatively simple security ring
" ’' ve kehete hai jis tarah se karat-karat abhyaas se jadmati hot sujan vaise hi ye chamatkaari kisson ko baar sunne or un par tark na karne se log ‘murkh sujan’ ho jate hai
 Professor Rajesh Sagar in the Psychiatry Department at AIIMS is also a Dr
 khokhar kii baat se ittefaq rakhte hai ve kehete hai, ‘ye suraksha kaa gheraa darasal sukun or sakaaratmak soch se bana ek vyaktigat sansar yaa yon kahen abhaasi saport system hota he
 Dr
 Khokhar says, this same confusion creates a crowd of blind devotees
 kyonki sawaal uthaanaa hamaari samskruti kaa hissaa nahin !dow khokhar kehete hai, ‘hamaari sosayadi main ‘self concept’ kaa koi concept hi nahin hota
 'society not only transfers not only material things in the inheritance to the coming generation, but also transfers something that develops our Believe system
 kai dharanaen anjaane hi hamaare bheetar jad jamaa leti hai
 Here we are discouraged to make logical interpretations of assumptions
 yani self concept viksit karne kii koshish karne waalon ko sosayadi bade- bujurgon kii soch kaa apmaan karne vaala maanati he
 Conversely, the more a society develops, the more a person will be motivated to develop an experience based Believe system

 Khokhar says' Do not write more studies or prosperity frees you from superstitions
 main phir kahata hum ki jaise hi baat loukik se upar uthakar paraloukik hoti he
 People consider the arguments arising in the mind as the result of satanic hoax
 ’asaram baapu hon yaa baba ram rahim yaa phir koi doosraa baba, ye log samaaj ke isi bilive system kaa phayda uthaakar logon ko thagte or bargalaate rahete hai
 Such fear is instilled in society that analyzing any so-called miracle is considered as a sin
 ames main cycatri vibhaag main professor rajesh sagar bhi andh vishwaas or aasthaa ko culture se judaa hua masalaa maanate hai
 They say 'the society we live in
 lagbhag vaisaa hi sochane- samajhane kaa system hamaare bheetar viksit hota he
 Religion has played a big role especially in Indian civilization
 ham bachapan se hi ishwar, chamatkaar jaise shabdon or inasi judi kahaniyaan sunate aa rahe hote hai
 Our brain is trained in such a way that we are prevented from questioning God, faith, religion, supernatural things
 mjedaar baat ye he ki taarkik se taarkik vyakti ko ye baat paat hi nahin chalati ki uske dimag main ek aisa konaa he jise wo nahin samaaj or ghar se mili dharanaen niyantrit kar rahi hoti hai
 'he further says,' Fear of isolation 'means that there is a fear in every person that if he questions issues like faith, reverence, he will be isolated in society
 anisht kii ashanka hamaare tarkon ko bhothra bana detii hadow

 Khokhar also says a similar analysis, 'a fear is created in us that if we try to tighten religion or faith in the test of arguments, we will be destroyed
 hamaare parivaar, mitrajanon ko is anisht kii aag main jhulasna padegaa
 Therefore in most cases faith takes deep and strong roots in the corner of the mind as a fear
 ’ ek majboot bilive system ban jaataa he
 Exactly as they laugh and say, we have a saying, "from practice to practice, there is a lot of confusion, the mark on the rasari avat jat sill
" to lagaataar andhvishwaas or in dharanaon kaa abhyaas karte-karte log murkh sujan ban jate hai
 "that is, by constantly nurturing these religious beliefs, the mind accepts this as true
" or sawaal uthaane waalon ke liye in dharanaon ke paksh main kai tark gadhane lagata he
 Professor Rajesh says, the feeling of 'fear' and 'insecurity' throws us into the blind well of faith
 jahaan se nikalnaa kathin hota he
 This is the reason that when a religion teacher or Baba is exposed, his devotees and shout loudly
 darasal wo bhakt baba se zyada apane liye banaae gaye ek jhuthe saport system ko bachaane kii purajor koshish kar rahaa hota he
 Because when a famous Baba is seen by his devotees helpless in front of the police and administration, then he feels like his existence staggers
 dow
 C
 pi
 Our society is such that it is considered wrong to raise questions in front of elders, says Khokhar
 mata-pita ke faislon par tark karne ko galat samajha jaataa he
 In such a situation, when it is said that the status of religion and God and their so-called self-proclaimed agents is above the parents
 to aise main phir in masalon par sawaal uthaanaa to gunaah-e-azim samajha jayega na!kya kya kabhi tuutegaa chamatkaaron kaa ye kaalpanik sansar ?lekin kya is bilive system ko todaa ja saktaa he? dow
 This system, says Khokhar, is built after years or centuries
 is bilive system ne kai pidiyon ke avchetan man ke safar ko tay kiya he
 If this Belive system has taken so long to build, then it will take time to break even and hard work
 sawaal ye uthta he ki kya ab samaaj ko or sajag hona hoga? kya sant ke chole pahane dhongi baabaaon ke khilaaf prashasan ko hi nahin balki samaaj ko bhi ek abhiyaan chhedana hoga?kyonki dow

 ) Regarding the government in Delhi, BJP leader Harsh Vardhan has said that his party will not form the government in Delhi
 unhone kaha ki unki party phir se chunaav main jane ko hai taiyaar he
 LG will call BJP to form government, Lt is being told that being the largest party, Lt
 Governor will call BJP to form government
 haalanki kejariwal ne vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kii he lekin alji use maanane ke liye baadhya nahin hai
 LG will take a decision in this regard only after talking to BJP
 isse pehle dilli vidhansabha main kejariwal ke bhaashan ke baad bijepi netaa harshavardhan ne dilli ke mukhyamantri par kadaa hamalaa bolaa
 He said 'I want to keep the truth in front of you
 kal sara din dilli kii vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ko chhod baaki sabhi dalon ke vidhayakon ne dilli ke kanoon mantri ke amaryadit vyavhaar ke khilaaf kol atension moshan or iske saath saath unki barkhaastagi or is par charchaa ke sandarbh main dinabhar ekamat hokar apni aawaaj ko janata ke hit main buland kiya
 But in the evening the Chief Minister of Delhi, Shri Arvind Kejriwal, crossed the culmination of lies
 unhone kaha ki congress party or bijepi ko ambani ji ne milwa diya
 First, the whole country has understood the nature of this lie
 isliye unke kisi bhi jhooth kaa jawaab dena na aavashyak he, na uchit he or na immergency he
 Otherwise we would have given it tomorrow
 hamaara ye kahana he ki bijepi ko agar congress party ne bhi kal samarthan kiya
 So it was not supported by BJP
 wo bhi hamaari tarah somnath bharti ke amaryadit aacharan kii aalochana kar rahe the or uski barkhaastagi kii maang kar rahe the
 Who wants to benefit Ambani saheb, it became clear today
 hamane dekha ki pehle to kejariwal ji ne ambani ji kii company ko, ek taraf logon ko kaha ki bijli ke daam kam karenge
 But gave permission to increase the surcharge price by six to eight percent and today the money of our blood and sweat earned for Ambani ji's electricity, which was for development
 safai karmchaariyon ke utthan ke liye tha
 372 crore rupees was also passed by bringing a bill to give power to Ambani's electricity company
 main ye samajhataa hum ki desh kii janata ko ye paryaapt maatra main spasht ho gaya hoga
 He says what he does, what he does
 tivi par kya bolta he or parde ke peeche kya santhganth karata he
 We say that Delhi CM Shri Arvind Kejriwal should stop making false and baseless allegations
 raajnneeti main shuchita kii baat karte hai, to paardarshee dhang se raajnneeti karen
 The second thing we want to clarify is that even when you explain the whole thing in the assembly and through TV channels, when you hear them on TV after two hours, they will lie again
 vah kahenge ki bijepi janalokapal bill virdohi he
 i want to tell the people of Delhi on record that we are a hundred times more in favor of BJP MLA Janlokpal Bill than Arvind Kejriwal and his party
 is dilli main agar lokayukta sanstha chalati he, jisane pichhali mukhyamantri shila ji ke khilaaf bhi kai faisle die
 That Lokayukta was created by the bjp's Delhi government
 madan laal khurana ji mukhyamantri the or main swasth ke saath kanoon mantri tha
 i presented that in the House
 agar hamaari party janalokapal bill virdohi hoti, to uttarakhand main hamaari party ke siem khanduri ji ise desh main sabase pehle pesh na karte
 If our party had not been in favor of the Jan Lokpal bill, this law made in the Lok Sabha would not have gained widespread support from our party
 adwani ji
 Mr
 Sushma jetali ji, sabhi ne iskaa saport kiya tha
 We also said earlier
 aaj bhi kaha
 We will not tolerate at any cost, insulting the law, for making laws
 aaj dilli ke mananeey uparajyapal ne spasht sandesh diya vidhansabha main, ki agar janalokapal bill laana he, to kanoonee prakriya ko puraa karnaa hoga
 i suggest to Kejriwal that if he is going to be the Chief Minister
 mujhe nahin pataa ki vah rahane vaale hai yaa nahin
 He had said that if the Jan Lokpal bill is not passed, he will resign
 main unase kahana chahta hum ki agar vah sabhi sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon ke saath sadan main janalokapal bill lekar aaenge
 We BJP mlas will make Delhi's law with more power than his party
 ab kuch ghanton baad vah dilli or desh kii janata ke saamne jhooth bolne kii koshish na karen
 If he tells one lie then we will reveal his ten lies
