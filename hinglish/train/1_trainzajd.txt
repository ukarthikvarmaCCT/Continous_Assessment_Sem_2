 ek july se deshbhar main ek desh lagu kar diya gaya
 It has been a month since the GST started with an ambitious target of one tax
 desh ke sabase bade kar sudhaar yani jiesti ke lagu hone se pehle or baad main bhi logon ke man main bahut saare sawaal ore sanshay hai
 Meanwhile, complaints are coming that if you are being charged more than MRP on a product in the name of GST, then it is completely wrong
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad upabhokta se kisi utpaada kesanshf se zyada damalia janaa galat he
 GST is linked in MRP, therefore the customer does not have to pay any money over MRP
 lekin dukandaar aapse emarpy ke baad bhi jiesti ke naam par kuch rupye vasuul rahe hai to satark ho jaae kyonki yah upabhokta adhikaron ke khilaaf he
 According to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, there is GST in MRP, therefore, nothing can be sold to you for more than that
 iske alaava agar kisi utpaada kaa emarpy, jiesti ke tahat bad rahaa he to company ko isaki jaankaree newspaper main aid ke zarie deni hogi or saath hi nai emarpy kaa steekar puranestikar ke saath utpaada par chipkanahona
 The ministry has given traders 60 days to make all these changes
 jiesti export ke mutabik kai dukandaar jaanboojhkar emarpy ke upar jiesti ke naam par charge kar rahe hai or log bhi agyantavash paise de rahe hai
 But it is very clear that no one can levy any other tax on MRP
 agar is tarah kaa koi bhi bill aapako miltaa he to aap centre sarkaar ke helpline number ke zarie uski shikaayat kar sakate hai

 elahabaad hycourt kii lakhanu peeth kaa 30 sitambar 2010 kaa faisla apane aap main kanoonee or naitik virodhabhas he
 In the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute, the Supreme Court is hearing the objections of both the parties on the basis of the same decision
 kai myne main yah ek aitihaasik faisla tha, phir bhi hycourt kaa faisla ajeebogareeb tareeke se un kuch muddon ko lekar bilkul khamosh tha jo nyaay ke buniyadi siddhant ke lihaaj se nihaayat jaruri the, khaskar 6 disambar, 1992 kii ghatana ko lekar
 The verdict could not say that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was an illegal act
 usne karsevakon kii us samuhik gundgardee kii pahchaan hi nahin kii, jisane us masjid ko mitti main mila diya
 He did not say anything to compensate the victims of that crime and the lives of nearly 2,000 people killed in communal riots across the country after the mosque was toppled
 usne ram janmabhumi andolan ke netritv or vidhik adhikariyon ko masjid kii suraksha karne main naakaam rahane ke liye bhi jimmedaar nahin tehraaya jabaki supreme court main un sabhi ne guarantee di thi ki ve kanoon kii hifaazat karenge
 Yet, in the case of handling the claim of ownership between two opposing communities, a three-judge bench of the High Court gave a historic verdict
 usne kaha ki ayodhya main 2
 The disputed land of 77 acres should be divided into three equal parts — Ramlala Virajaman, who was represented by the Hindu Mahasabha, for the construction of the Ram temple, between the Sunni Waqf Board and the Nirmohi Akhara
 court ne shaayad apana faisla un aitihaasik vivaranon par aadhaarit kiya, jinamein kaha gaya tha ki sadiyon se hindu or musalmaan us sthaan par saath-saath puja karte aa rahe the jinke bich baad main angrejon ke aupniveshik shashan ne diwaar daal di
 Following the principles of fair sharing of inheritance, the court ruled that the entire property is deemed to be collectively owned by Muslims and Hindus and should be distributed among the litigants with fairness under the relevant property laws of India
 court ke masjid ke madhya gumbad vaale sthaan ko, jisamen ramalala kii murti rakhi hui thi, ko hinduon (hindu mahasabha) ke pratinidhiyon ko saunpane ke faisle kii aalochana hui he
 But the fact is that if the verdict were anything, it would appear to go in the interest of one party
 loktantr main court ne vishuddh is khyaal se bhi faisle ko bahusankhyak samudaay ke paksh main diya hoga taaki sadakon par khoonkhraba failane ke dar ko kam se kam kiya ja sake
 Although the bench of the three judges did not agree that the disputed structure was built by demolishing a temple, it was agreed that the temple or the structure of a temple was built before the mosque at the same place
 bhartiya puratathvik survey kii khudaai kaa court ne sakshya ke taur par khaasaa istemaal kiya jiske anusaar vahaan pehle kaa dhaancha ek vishaal hindu mandir kaa tha
 Thinking sensitively, this decision tried its best to create a balance between the two communities

 Four days after the SP session ended, on October 14, in connection with the meeting of the Union Executive Board of the Union, Sarsangh driver Mohan Bhagwat reached Lucknow and had dinner with Governor Ram Naik

 The entire Hindu atmosphere was warmed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad invoking the Chaurasi Kosi Parikrama in Ayodhya last year on the temple issue, but now under changing circumstances, the Sangh is expressing its soft attitude on the Ram temple issue
 centre main bijepi sarkaar banane ke baad sangh aisa koi kadam nahin uthaanaa chahta, jisase kisi bhi rup main narendra modi ke paksh main bana maahaul asthir ho
 This time the word Love Jihad was not used in the Sangh meeting, but concern was raised on the issue like conversion
 joshi kehete hai, ''sangh lav jehad ko sampradayik nahin, balki saamaajik or prashasnic mudda maanata he
 "the increase in the number of full-time campaigners within the BJPBJP with campaigners (amit Shah was also present on the first day of the meeting) is a sign of the Sangh's growing influence on the party

 5 percent rigging has been caught
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bharat ne jo nai pranali apanaai he usamen 21 sector kaa hisaab liya jaataa he
 There is a dispute about this
 unhone likhaa he ki bharat kii niti kii jo gaadi he usamen laga speedometer gadabad he balki tutaa hua he
 The Indian Express has published his article in detail
 pathak ise dhyaan se padhein
 Hindi newspapers serve garbage for you
 aise masale unke zarie aap tak kabhi pahunchenge nahin
 This is done so that the readership of Hindi readers does not develop more than the ability to read one line messages of whatsapp and share chat
 yah aapke hit main he ki hindi akhbaaron or channelon kaa satark nigahon se moolyankan karen
 Arvind Subramanian states that he has done his calculations on the basis of 17 sectors
 gananaa kaa kaal 2002—17 he
 Consumption of electricity, sale of two-wheelers, sale of commercial vehicles, airfare, industrial production index (IIP), index of consumer goods, petroleum, cement, steel, and import-export of services and goods
 isse aapako pataa chalaa ki in sectoron ke aadhaar par jidipi kaa moolyankan hota he
 Not only this, Arvind Subramanian has compared India to 71 high and medium economy countries
 iske liye alag se paimaane liye hai
 Loans, exports, imports and electricity
 unka kahana he ki jidipi ke aankadon jin aadhaar par tay hote hai unhen rashtriya or antarrashtriya arthshaastriyon ke liye uplabdh kara dena chahie
 In my opinion this is also correct because neither the government nor the public will be cheated by this in finding the actual situation
 iconomik times (10 june 2019) car or bike banane vaali chotii kii companiyon ne apana utpaadan band kar diya he
 Factories are being closed so that the cars made are sold
 35,000 karod kii paanch lakh gaadiyaan dealron ke yahaan padi hui hai
 Are not sold 17000 karod kii tees lakh bike kaa koi kharidaar nahin he
 Now think, even the car is not selling, the bike is also not selling
 iskaa do hi matlab ho saktaa he ki auto companiyon ne zyaada utpaadan kiya hoga yaa phir logon kii aarthik kshamta ghat gai he
 Seven companies, including Maruti, Tata, Mahindra and Mahindra, have had to close plants in May and June
 somvaar ko dilli kaa taapmaana 48 degree celsius chalaa gaya
 The temperature has been so high in 100 years
 paryaavaran ke lihaaz se kaaron kaa na bikna acha hi he
 But this sales have come down because of the decline in economic efficiency, not because of better choice of cars
 hamaari arthvyavastha kaa hisaab-kitaab upbhog or utpaadan par he
 If both are low, then there will be an impact on GDP and also on employment opportunities in the automobile sector
 isaki khabaren nahin aa rahi hai ki iskaa dealer se lekar factory ke rojgaar par kya asar pad rahaa he
 Is there a large-scale retrenchment in the sector right now? Every time the picture of the economic crisis behind the political mandate becomes marginal
 bataaya jaataa he ki phir janadesh kaise aayaa
 There is no one answer to this
 vyapaaree hi bataa sakate hai ki ghaataa uthaakar wo kisi ko kyon vot karte hai or phayda uthaakar kisi ko vot kyon nahin karte hai
 There is no benefit in going to this debate
 aarthik sankat ke bare main jaankaree sahi sahi honi chahie khaskar ab jab sabit ho gaya he ki kharaab aarthik sankat ke baad bhi log modi sarkaar main prachand vishwaas rakhte hai
 Talking about this crisis will be the way out

 unhone kaha ki is kanoon ko is tarah se lagu kiya janaa chahie ki saarvajanik sevaaon kii aapurti main maanav bal kaa istemaal kam se kam karnaa pade
 Sibal said, we have to put in place a system through e-administration so that human intervention in the supply of services is minimized
 mantri ne iskar rifund kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki kis tarah kai baar adhikari rifund dene ke liye paisa maangate hai
 Sibal said, many times the example of people of Income Tax Department is given in the country

 At the beginning of this session, the experts sitting on the stage admitted that there were two budgets left for the tenure of the Modi government
 yah donon bajet sarkaar ke liye behad ahm he
 Before the upcoming budget, the demand of demonetisation of the central government has given a shock to the demand, while the industry has stopped the investment in the economy

 kuldeep ne kaha ki notebandi jaise faisle ke baad ab sarkaar ko yah sochane kii jarurat he ki is kadam se desh main kitna paisa aayaa he yaa aane kii ummid he
 According to Kuldeep, all the measures taken by the reforms in the country, including demonetisation, have not seen the benefit of increasing the tax in the country
 lihaaja ab uski chunauti yah honi chahie ki vah kitni jaldi bank khaaton kii jaanch kar yah pataa laga sake ki arthvyavastha main kaledhan par lagaam lagane kii is kavayad se sarkaar ko kya or kitna phayda hua he
 Sunil Alagh claimed that there will be no corruption in the country for the next 2-3 years due to demonetisation
 lihaaja ise aage bhi kaayam rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he ki bainkon se badi rakam kii nikasi par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa jaae
 Ashok Lahiri said that no person wants to pay tax
 ye kaaphi pechida he

 Tax evaders should be put in jail

 magar mukhyamantri chouhaan ne bachaav karte hue kaha tha ki yah sabhi kaa faisla tha
 But today Rahul made it clear that no one should be spared on this issue
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko is par dobaaraa vichaar karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, after a meeting with 11 Congress Chief Ministers on Friday, Rahul Gandhi said that we want to create a framework for ending corruption in the country, but the opposition is only talking big, not passing the bill pending in Parliament
 Giving padhie rahul gandhi ne tamaam muddon par kya kaha, unheen ke shabdon main
 
 
 What i said to the Chief Ministers
 All our states have accepted that they will bring the Lokayukta to the national level Lokayukta by February
 mahangaai main mukhya mudda fal or sabji kii keemton kaa he, jisamen hamane do teen kadam uthaae hai
 What i said earlier, the Lokpal Bill is one step
 agar ham sachmuch main karpshan se ladanaa chaahate hai, to hamen ek frem work kii jarurat he or yah sirf neshlan level par nahin state level par chahie
 Rather it is more important on the state
 is disha main congress party kaam kar rahi he
 Only Congress is talking about changing the system
 See, as i said earlier
 agar ham is par gambhir hai, to yah ek bill kii baat nahin he
 It is a matter of frame work, system
 mere liye ye dilachasp he ki keval ek party system kii baat kar rahi he
 Other parties are not showing the way forward
 maikenism kii baat nahin kar rahi hai karpshan se ladane ke liye
 Bills are pending in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 use paas nahin hone de raheen
 We are committed
 or iske liye ek or satr ke liye bhi taiyaar hai
 There is a line in the Lok Sabha when i say pass the bill and fight corruption, there is silence in the opposition, there is silence on the issue of Lokpal in the states ruled by the opposition parties
 dekhie, agar sachmuch main bhrashtachar ke mudde par baton se aage janaa he, to dhaanche kii jarurat he
 In the Lok Sabha, there is a line of bills
 hamaare saath milakar vipaksh un bills ko paas kar de
 Pass those bills, then see what happens in this country, but they will not
 badi-badi baaten karenge
 Fashion is made here, brother talk
 badalanaa he, to kanoon banaao
 The Maharashtra Government's decision on the Adarsh society scam, i do not agree with this decision
 unhen dobaaraa is par vichaar karnaa chahie
 This is my personal view
 maharashtra ke masale par yah saaf he ki kisi ko nahin bachaaya jayega

 dilli congress main bura daur khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 While the Congress has gone far away from power in another Delhi, on the other hand, even after making all the changes at the organization level, the leaders are not even taking the name of ending conflicts and quarrels

 In fact, on Thursday, the Delhi Congress appointed 3 new spokespersons

 Rohit Manchanda who is said to be close to Sheila Dixit
 unhone beete dinon media ke saamne aakar khulkar pisi chaako kaa istipha maanga tha
 Rohit Manchanda had told the media during that time that PC Chacko had pushed him from the lift and told him not to appear in the office of Delhi Congress
 lekin ab dilli congress ne rohit manachanda kii pradesh pravaktaa ke pad par niyukti kar di he
 In such a situation, this decision is being seen as a protest against PC Chacko
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki aane vaale dinon main dilli congress kin-kin sankaton se juujhati he
 Recently, the tussle between Sheila Dixit and Congress in-charge PC Chacko in the Delhi Congress came to the fore when Sheila Dixit changed all the block level leaders of Delhi without telling the leadership, on the other hand, only a few days after that
 Sheila Dixit's order was canceled by Delhi Congress spokesperson PC Chacko
 iske kuch din pehle dilli prabharee pisi chaako ne teenon hi kaaryakari adhyakshon ko patr likhakar shila dikshit ke bagaiyr bhi swatantra rup se baithak lene kaa nirdesh diya tha lekin iske turant baad shila dikshit ne teen main se do kaaryakari adhyakshon ke par katarte hue unase tamaam mahatvapurn jimmedaariyaan waapas le lee thi

 So far no official statement has come from the Congress party in this matter
 bataa den kiaikar vibhaag ne beete dinon hyderabadki ek infrastracchar company ke yahaan par chapa maaraa tha
 In this, it was revealed that Rs 170 crore has been sent to the Congress party through hawala on behalf of the company, on which the Income Tax Department stepped up the investigation
 is fund ko sarkari project ke hisaab se alag rakhaa gaya tha or isaki bogus billing taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It has also been found in the investigation that the bogus bills prepared by the company were related to the government projects which were directly related to the economic vicar section
 bataa den ki is company ke dwaara kuch anya raajnneetik partiyon ko bhi isi tarah kaa chanda dene kii baat saamne aa rahi he

 Sources close to this star cricketer gave this information on Tuesday, so that the long-running speculation about his career may come to an end
 bharat ke july main england main khele gaye vanade vishwa cap se semifinal main baahar hone ke baad se hi dhoni kisi match main nahin khele hai
 Dhoni did not tour the West Indies and after that he did not play in the home series against South Africa and Bangladesh
 sutron ne pitiai se kaha, ‘dhoni agar apane bhavishya ko lekar koi faisla karenge, to aisa ipel ke baad hi hoga
 You cannot stop speculation, because he is a very big player

 Dhoni, however, has not spoken about his future on his behalf
 unhen haalanki kuch din pehle jharkhand under-23 team ke saath abhyaas karte hue dekha gaya tha, jiske baad unki sambhavit vaapasi kii atkal lagaai jane lagi thi
 BCCI President Sourav Ganguly has also said that Dhoni will be given the same respect as a player like him deserves
 unhone is star wicketiper ballebaaj ke turant hi sanyas lene se bhi inkaar kiya
 After assuming the post of board president last month, Ganguly said, 'you know champions don't end soon

 According to the coach, it depends on when he starts playing and how he plays in the IPL
 vahiin duusare khilaadi wicketcaping main kya kar rahe hai or dhoni ke mukaable unka form kya he
 The IPL will be a big tournament as you will have around 15 players decided
 'unhone kaha, 'main kah saktaa hum ki ipel ke baad aapaki team lagbhag tay ho jaaegi

 An Election Commission official said, "after deliberating on the matter, the Commission decided not to proceed in this direction

 According to the Meteorological Department, there is a possibility of heavy rains in the north and east areas of Bihar from the second week of September
 nepal ke pahari kshetron main badal fatne kii bhi ashanka he jiskaa sidhaa asar uttar bihar par padegaa
 After the warnings of the Meteorological Department, the Emergency Management Department of the Government of Bihar has started arranging relief and rescue
 halaki mausam vibhaag ne ye bhi kaha he ki badal fatne jaisi ashankaon par wo 48 ghante pehle soochna de saktaa he lekin aitihathan utar bihar ke sabhi jilon main alert jari kar diya he
 The Bihar government has sought more troops from the ADRF

 According to the Indian Meteorological Department, heavy to heavy rains are expected in the northern and eastern areas of Bihar

 After the cloudburst, the water level of the water can rise further in the rivers, which can cause flooding in the already filled rivers
 bihar main vaise to sitambar kaa maheenaa har saal afat le kar aati he
 Because these days the flood water in the rivers is full
 lekin is baar sthiti kuch zyada chintajanak he
 The country has received 11 percent more rainfall than normal this year and especially in northern India

 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main tarikhon ke elaan ke baadabijepiur congress ke liye sabase badi chunauti he tikat kaa bantwaaraa or baagiyon par kaabo paanaa
 For Chhattisgarh, BJP has declared candidates for 77 seats, in which 14 mlas have been ticketed
 vahiin khabar yah bhi he ki satta virdohi lahar ko kamatar karne ke liye bijepi is baar bade paimaane par vidhayakon ke tikat kaat sakati he
 In fact, through this strategy, the BJP wants to send a message to the leaders and Lok Sabha mps of other states that if their feedback is not good, then they can also fall on the basis of work in the upcoming elections
 is
 yaad kiijie madhya pradesh ke kaaryakarta mahakumbh party adhyaksh ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha tha ki aapkaa sabase bada hathiyaar namo ap he jiske jariye aap sidhe piem se jude hai
 According to BJP sources, in addition to the traditional medium, this time the feedback is being taken through the Namo app
 namo ap kaa istemaal aam janata or party ke jamini kaaryakarta apane pratinidhiyon ke pradarshan ke bare main sidhe pradhanmantrinarendra modiko feedback de rahe hai
 Obviously, the Namo app will prove to be an effective weapon for BJP strategists before ticket distribution
 madhya pradesh main 70-80 vidhayakon ke cat sakate hai tiktasattadhari bijepi ke madhya pradesh kii 230 sadasyeey vidhansabha main 165 vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, news is coming that the BJP is seriously considering cutting the tickets of about half of these, ie 70-80 mlas, including some ministers
 bijepi ke ek netaa ne naam saamne na aane dene kii shart par kaha he ki kuch netaaon ke khilaaf janata main aakrosh he jisaki vajah se party alaakaman ye faisla le sakati he
 According to BJP sources, during the Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhanki Jan Ashirwad Yatra, he has also received complaints about some leaders who did not work
 aise main bijepi kaa maananaa he ki jin siton par unke netaaon ke khilaaf janata kaa aakrosh he, un siton par nae chehron ke saath utraa jaae
 Significantly, in the 2013 assembly elections, BJP preferred new faces in 25 percent of the seats, out of which 75 percent candidates won
 jaahir he party is strike rate ko phir aajmaana chaahati he
 But this time their number may increase
 rajasthan main bhi bade paimaane par cat sakate hai tiktamovesh yahi haalat rajasthan bijepi main bhi he
 The BJP has 163 mlas in 200-member Rajasthan
 haal main bijepi ke ek aantarik survey main siton ko teen shrenee main baanta gaya
 According to this survey, 137 seats of Rajasthan assembly seats have been kept in the b and c category
 jinke bare main kaha ja rahaa he ki inamen se adhikansh siton par nae chehron ko tikat thamaaye ja sakate hai
 Shockingly, most of the members of the Council of Ministers are also in this Danger Zone
 aapako bataa den ki 2013 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 125 siton par nae chehron ko mauka diya tha, jisamen 95 fisadi chehre safal rahe the
 Obviously this time also the party cannot ignore this strike rate during ticket distribution
 rajasthan main bijepi ke prabharee or kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne ek angreji akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki is baar tikat vitaran kaaphi chaunkaane vaala hoga or maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat katane se party ko madad milegi
 Congress state president Sachin Pilot had said in a press conference after the election committee meeting recently that when the BJP does not trust its mlas then what will the public trust their government
 badalte jaateey sameekaran bhi hai karanrajasthan main bijepi ke paramparaagat vot bank brahman or kshatriya bijepi se dur hote najar aa rahe hai

 vahiin jodhpur sambhag se bada rajput gharaana barmer kaa jasol parivaar congress main shaamil ho gaya
 To compensate for the anger of the Gurjars, the BJP has included Kirori Lal Meena, the elder leader of the Gurjars' rival Meenas
 vahiin daliton main bhi party ko lekar naaraazgi he
 The situation in Madhya Pradesh is more or less similar
 essi / asti act ke virodh main saamaanya, pichhadaa evam alpsankhyak varg adhikari karmchaaree sanstha (sapaks) ne sabhi siton par ummidavaar utaarne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 It is to be known that the upper caste is the traditional vote of the BJP, but they are also angry with the government's stand on the SC / ST Act
 pichley dinon savarnon ke andolan kaa sabase zyada asar madhya pradesh or rajasthan main hi dekhne ko mila tha
 How to deal with the rebels? In such a situation, if the tickets of the sitting mlas are cut, the BJP may have to face a lot of difficulty in dealing with the rebels in many seats
 kyonki ve dal jinke paas janaadhar or netaa nahin hai, ve isi taak main baithe hai ki do bade dal bijepi yaa congress ke baagiyon ko tikat dekar donon kaa khel kharaab kiya jaae

 He said, "I told the BSF DG that if Pakistan does not desist from its antics and continues to violate, then (BSF personnel) give a clear order that the white flag will not be shown next time but (from India) Firing will be started
 ' Rajnath Singh said that during the last 10 years of Congress rule, not only in India but also in the whole world, there was a perception that we are a weak country
 unhone kaha, 'par modi sarkaar banane ke baad duniya ne dharna badal lee he
 We are no longer considered poor countries
 ham kamjor nahin hai
 We have full potential to give a befitting reply

 With a conch shell named Modi, Narendra Modi himself came into the arena with a big strategy to surround the Congress all the way and started to open the Congress layer by layer

 holashtak shabd sunate hi holi aane kii aahat man main jaag jaati he
 Yes, Holashtak starts eight days before Holi, on the Ashtami date of Shukla Paksha of Phalgun month
 is saal holashtak 5 march se shuru hokar 12 march tak rahegaa
 To understand what is Holashtakahlashtak first understand its literal meaning
 holashtak yani hola or ashtak se milakar bana shabdal
 Hola means Holi and eight days i
e
 eight days
 saral shabdon main kaha jaae to holi se pehle ke 8 din holashtak kehalaate hai
 As soon as Holashtak starts, people start preparing for Holi
 holikaa pujan ke liye holi ke 8 din pehle jis sthaan par holikaa dahan karnaa he, us sthaan ko gangaajal se shuddh karke holi kaa danda sthapit kar diya jaataa he or sukhi lakadiyaan, upale ekatrit karke har din log usee sthaan main jamaa karte jate hai taaki holikaa dahan ke din bada dher ikattha ho sake
 Why it is considered inauspicious In the Holashtakadharma texts, 8 days of Holashtak are considered inauspicious for Manglik works
 iske peeche kai manyataayen hai
 It is believed that Kamdev from Bholenath was consumed on the Ashtami of the month of Falgun on trying to dissolve the penance of Lord Shiva
 prem ke devtaa kaamdev ke bhasma hote hi puure sansar main shok kii lahar fail gai thi
 Then Kamdev's wife Rati apologized to Shiva and Bholenath assured Kamdev to revive
 iske baad logon ne rang khelkar khushi manaai thi
 In some texts, it is told that Prahlada started torturing his father Hiranyakashyap 8 days before Holi
 aathven din holikaa kii god main prahlaad ko bithakar maarane kaa prayaas kiya gaya tha lekin aag main naa jalane kaa vaardaan paane vaali holikaa jal gai thi or balak prahlaad batch gaya tha
 The 8 days of torture of God devotee Prahlada is not considered auspicious, so there is a tradition of not doing any auspicious work

 Recently, the Pakistani umpire for the india-south Africa match had to be removed due to political opposition
 ham apane stadium main pakistani ampire nahin dekh sakate lekin dubai or srilanka main donon tiimon ko khelte hue maje lekar dekh sakate hai

 baad main jab pradhanmantri bane to 2014 main ananthamurti ne kaha ki bharat chhodane kii baat bhavukta main kah di thi lekin main bijepi kaa virodh jari rakhuunga
 Ananthamurthy was strongly opposed when he said that i have also been writing against Nehru and Indira but never had to face such opposition

 Should we not talk openly on this trend? kya yahi asahansheeltaa nahin he ki desh kii badanaami ho rahi he
 Will it also be said tomorrow that soldiers are sitting on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, which is bringing the country into disrepute

 Although many people have started talking about leaving Delhi, but widely we all know that the air of Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, RK Puram and Mandir Marg of Delhi has been polluted by eight times more than the normal level
 
 dilli hi nahin patna, lakhanu, agra or faridabad kii hawa bhi buree tarah pradooshit ho chuki he, zahreeli ho chuki he
 Are we not tolerant of this poisonous air? bilkul hai
 The country should not be infamous, so i do not want to call poisonous air, not polluted air, but holy wind

 Had we not been tolerant, the Cricket Board of Pakistan and India would not have been searching for a stadium in Sri Lanka to have a match between the two countries
 haal hi raajnneetik virodh ke chalate bharat-dakshin africa match ke pakistani ampire ko hataanaa padaa tha
 We cannot see the Pakistani umpire in our stadium but can have fun playing both teams in Dubai and Sri Lanka
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki ham partli asahansheel hai or partli sahansheel bhi hai
 Will be completely intolerant when someone says that India's viewers will not watch any match with Pakistan

 ananthamurti kaa khub virodh hua tab unhone kaha ki main nehru or indira ke kilaaf bhi likhata rahaa hum lekin aisa virodh kabhi nahin jhelana padaa
 Modi did not become Prime Minister then, but Modi did not become Prime Minister even when Giriraj Singh said in April 2014 that anti-modi should go to Pakistan
 disambar 2014 main tamilnadu main ek maamla hota he or vahaan jayalalita kii sarkaar he
 The opposition to Perumal Murugan's novel increased so much that the district administration forcibly signed an apology
 mangalvaar ke indian express main us prasang par ek lekh aayaa he jiske anusaar bijepi or sangh ke log inkaar karte hai ki ve shaamil nahin the magar lekhak ne daawa kiya he ki sangh or bijepi ke logon ne bhi murugan kaa virodh kiya tha
 Murugan was so hurt that he wrote on Facebook that writer Perumal Murugan has died
 wo bhagwaan nahin he
 Will not come again now
 tippaniyan In our country, there has been opposition from films, books on behalf of many religious organizations
 dhamkiyaan bhi milti rahi hai or jaan se bhi maar diya gaya he
 When such incidents have not brought a bad name to the country, foreign investors have not been affected, then how is the infamy going on
 janvari 2013 main 'vishvarupam' film ke relij hone par hangaamaa hua to abhinayta camel hasan ne kaha tha, 'main ek kalakaar hum
 i have no inclination towards any religion
 na to main left hum na rhite hum
 i am fed up
 mujhe nahin pataa kya chal rahaa he
 i am looking for a secular place in another state
 agar kuch dinon main wo jagah nahin mili to main baahar ke secular mulk main chalaa jaaoongaa
 ' tab kisi ne nahin kaha ki camel hasan ke is bayaan se bharat kii badanaami ho gai
 If there is intolerance then why Arun Shourie's son was targeted for criticizing the Prime Minister
 kya hamen is pravriti par khulkar baat nahin kerani chahie
 Isn't it the intolerance that the nation is being infamous
 kya kal yah bhi kaha jayega ki jantar mantar par sainik dharne par baithe hai isse desh kii badanaami ho rahi he
 Farmers are committing suicide, it does not bring disrepute to the country
 desh main asahansheeltaa bad rahi he is baat se badanaami kaise ho jaati he
 Along with politics, we are very tolerant of pollution
 vaise kai log dilli chhod kar jane kii baat karne lage hai magar phir bhi vyapak rup se ham sab yah jaanate hue bhi ki dilli ke anand vihaar, punjabi baag, aarake puram or mandir maarg kii hawa saamaanya str se aath guna zyaada pradooshit ho chuki he
 Not only Delhi, the air of Patna, Lucknow, Agra and Faridabad has also been severely polluted, poisonous
 kya ham is jahrili hawa ke prati sahansheel nahin hai
 Absolutely
 desh kii badanaami na ho isliye main zahreeli hawa nahin, pradooshit hawa nahin balki pavitra pawan pukarana chahta hum
 The debate of tolerance and intolerance is getting ridiculous
 ham sahansheel na hote to pakistan or bharat kaa cricket board donon deshon ke bich match karaane ke liye srilanka main stadium na khoj rahaa hota
 Recently, the Pakistani umpire for the india-south Africa match had to be removed due to political opposition
 ham apane stadium main pakistani ampire nahin dekh sakate lekin dubai or srilanka main donon tiimon ko khelte hue maje lekar dekh sakate hai
 This means that we are Partly intolerant and Partly tolerant as well
 purnat: asahansheel tab honge jab koi kahe ki bharat kaa darshak pakistan ke saath koi match nahin dekhegaa
 Or only Indian players will be shown in the camera which will be broadcast in India
 aamir khan ne sahansheeltaa kii bahes ched di he
 By the way, i had chosen many people to say in this government before that government that there is traffic jam here, hospital is not right, system is not there, it is difficult to stay in India
 bahut se log jo enarai cote se rashtravaadi bane hue hai wo saavdhaan rahen ki kahin unhen bharat chhodane vaala bhagoda na qaraar de diya jaae
 Aamir Khan said, 'when i talk to Kiran at home, i say whether we should go out of India
 kiran kaa aisa kahana badi baat he
 What a terrible thing use apane bachche ke liye dar lagata he
 The environment around us is scared
 isse sanket miltaa he ki ashaanti bad rahi he
 It doesn't feel good when you feel it
 mujhe bhi aisa lagata he
 Those in power should strongly condemn what is going wrong
 aamir ke is bayaan par asahansheeltaa virdohi or sahansheeltaa samarthak aapas main bhid gaye hai
 This fight has become ridiculous and frightening
 twitor par ap vaapasi hesh tag chal rahaa he
 Aamir Khan is the brand ambassador of Snapdeal
 ab logon ne twit karnaa shuru kar diya he ki snap deal ke ap ko apane phone se hataane kaa abhiyaan shuru kar diya he
 Snapdeal's app ratings have started to deteriorate
 kuch to he jo saamaanya nahin he
 Isn't this intolerance? ap vaapasi waalon kaa kahana he ki aamir khan ke bayaan kaa ham sahansheeltaa se virodh kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, there have also come some people who have started talking about downloading the app of Snapdill
 aapane aise kai netaaon ke bayaan sune honge jo sarkaar main mantri hai, saasand hai or netaa bhi hai jo kai sandarbhon main pakistan bhejne kii baat kar chuke hai
 Now, who will decide who gets India's infamy
 pakistan bhejne vaale bayanon se yaa maahaul thik nahin he india se chalem kya vaali baton se
 Talking about Aamir Khan, BJP MP and film actor Paresh Rawal said, 'aamir is a fighter, he should not leave the country but should change the situation in the country
 jeena yahaan maranaa yahaan
 The true patriot does not run away from his motherland
 ' ashishnutaa, pike film ne hindu bhaavana ko aahat kiya lekin aamir ko hinduon kii naaraazgi nahin jhelni padi balki wo film to super hit rahi or karodon kamai hui
 The CM of Kashmir says that the Prime Minister is not communal
 moulana madani kehete hai ki musalamaanon ke liye bharat se acha desh nahin he
 Is Paresh Rawal not linking the identity of Aamir Khan with religion, on the pretext of feeling of Hindu majority
 bijepi ke saansad adityanath ne kaha he ki koi khud se bharat chhodana chaahe to jaae, isse aabaadi kam hogi
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi Sahab has said that we will not allow Aamir from India
 13 november ko landan main bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne vividhta kaa paaramparik vivaran dete hue saaf-saaf kaha ki logon ko aashcharya he ki aisa desh jahaan sau bhashaaen hon, 1500 boliyaan hon, hazaron prakaar ke khanpan kii paddatiyaan ho
 You can see hundreds of light costumes coming out of the south and reaching the north, our country is full of diversities and diversity is our specialty
 Diversity, diversity is also our pride, diversity is also our power
 15 oktober ko haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal kaa bayaan aata he ki muslim rah sakate hai magar is desh main bif khaanaa chhodana padegaa
 Another explanation from such statements is expected to be whether the Prime Minister also incorporates beef into thousands of types of food variety
 bijepi ko lagata he ki sahansheeltaa ke naam par modi sarkaar ko target kiya ja rahaa he kyonki mudda uthaane vaale bijepi virdohi hai
 Late writer UR Ananthamurthy had said in September 2013 that Modi would leave India if he became Prime Minister
 baad main jab pradhanmantri bane to 2014 main ananthamurti ne kaha ki bharat chhodane kii baat bhavukta main kah di thi lekin main bijepi kaa virodh jari rakhuunga
 Ananthamurthy was strongly opposed when he said that i have also been writing against Nehru and Indira but never had to face such opposition
 tab modi pradhanmantri nahin bane the, lekin tab bhi modi pradhanmantri nahin bane the jab april 2014 main giriraaj singh ne kaha tha ki modi virdohi pakistan chale jaaen
 a case occurs in Tamil Nadu in December 2014 and there is Jayalalithaa's government
 perumal murugan ke upanyaas ko lekar virodh itnaa bad gaya ki zila prashasan ne jabaran maafeename par dastakhat karvaa liya
 Tuesday's Indian Express featured an article on the incident, according to which BJP and Sangh people deny that they were not involved but the author has claimed that Sangh and BJP people also opposed Murugan
 murugan itnaa aahat ho gaye ki fasebuk par likh diya ki lekhak perumal murugan mar gaya he
 He is not God
 ab dobaaraa nahin aayega
 The comments hamaare mulk main kai dharmik sanghathanon kii taraf se filmon, kitabon kaa virodh hota rahaa he
 Threats have been received and have been killed
 aisi ghatnaon se tab jab desh kii badanaami nahin hui, videshi niveshkon par fark nahin padaa to ab kaise badanaami ho rahi he
 When the release of the film 'vishwaroopam' in January 2013 created a ruckus, actor Kamal Haasan had said, 'I am an artist
 meraa kisi dharm ke prati koi jhukaav nahin he
 i am neither left nor right
 main fed ap ho chukaa hum
 i don't know what's going on main kisi duusare rajya main secular place kii talash main hum
 If i do not find that place in a few days, then i will move to a secular country outside
 ' No one said then that this statement of Kamal Haasan earned India's infamy
 asahansheeltaa nahin hoti to pradhanmantri kii aalochana karne par arun shouri ke bete ko kyon nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Should we not talk openly on this trend? kya yahi asahansheeltaa nahin he ki desh kii badanaami ho rahi he
 Will it also be said tomorrow that soldiers are sitting on a dharna at Jantar Mantar, which is bringing the country into disrepute
 kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai usase to desh kii badanaami nahin hoti
 How intolerance in the country is leading to infamy
 sahansheeltaa or asahansheeltaa kii bahes haasyaaspad hoti chali ja rahi he
 Had we not been tolerant, the Cricket Board of Pakistan and India would not have been searching for a stadium in Sri Lanka to have a match between the two countries
 haal hi raajnneetik virodh ke chalate bharat-dakshin africa match ke pakistani ampire ko hataanaa padaa tha
 We cannot see the Pakistani umpire in our stadium but can have fun playing both teams in Dubai and Sri Lanka
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki ham partli asahansheel hai or partli sahansheel bhi hai
 Will be completely intolerant when someone says that India's viewers will not watch any match with Pakistan
 yaa phir bharat main jo prasaaran hoga camere main sirf bhartiya khilaadi hi dikhaaye jaaenge
 Aamir Khan has sparked the debate of tolerance
 vaise kai logon ko maine is sarkaar se pehle us sarkaar main bhi kehete chunaa tha ki yaar yahaan trephic jam hai, aspataal thik nahin he, system hi nahin he, india main rahanaa hi mushkil he
 Many people who remain nationalists from the NRI quota should be careful that they should not be declared as fugitives leaving India
 aamir khan ne kaha, 'jab main ghar main kiran se baat karata hum to kahata hum ki kya hamen india se baahar janaa chahie
 This is a big thing Kiran says

 This indicates that there is increasing unrest
 aap jab yah mahasoos karte hai to acha nahin lagata he
 i feel the same

 a bus has been abducted in Mumbai
 kurlaa ke paas best kii 332 number bas main ek vyakti revolver lekar ghus gaya or usne bas ko agava karne kii koshish kii
 The bus was going from Kurla to Andheri
 is dauraan police ne hamalavar par firing kii jisamen vah ghayal ho gaya
 The attacker also fired three rounds
 ghayal hamalavar ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya jahaan baad main uski maut ho gai
 All passengers of the bus are safe

 This young man named Rahul Raj was 23 years old and was a resident of Patna
 wo eksre faclti main padhai kar rahaa tha
 According to Rahul's father Kundan Prasad, he had gone to Mumbai in search of a job and he had left alone from Patna
 bas main savaar chashmadidon ke mutabik rahul baar-baar chilla rahaa tha ki wo raaj thakare ko maarane aayaa he
 He informed a passenger on a mobile phone to the police that he had come to kill Raj Thackeray who was persecuting the North Indians and brought the police Raj to him
 kurlaa se andhri ja rahi is bas main rahul chadha or conductor par pistaul taan di
 He even intimidated the passengers
 ghatana subah saadhe aath baje kii he
 According to the conductor, Rahul also informed the police about hijacking the bus
 police ne bas ko gherkar rahul par paanch round goliyaan daagin
 The injured Rahul died till he reached the hospital
 best bas hijac karne kii koshish ke maamle main police kii firing par kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The biggest question was whether it was a police encounter or a murder? The police could have caught Rahul trying to kidnap the bus, but why did the police shoot him instead of catching him? When the police arrived on the spot, Rahul was alone in the bus
 wo logon ko daraa-dhamka jarur rahaa tha, lekin kisi ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa rahaa tha
 The bus was empty and no one was to be harmed by it, so why did the police need to fire five rounds
 kya wo koi khunkhaar apradhi tha, jise police pakad nahin sakati thi? Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as promised, did not take a holiday even on Diwali and met the flood victims of Jammu and Kashmir

" i urged for cooperation
 ' vyapaariyon ne maang kii ki unke beemaa sambandhi daawey kaa jald nivaaran ho tathaa 10 saal tak kar main raahat mili
 Earlier, Modi announced a relief package for the flood victims

 shujit sarkaar ke nirdesan main bani film ‘piku’pita-beti ke rishton par aadhaarit he
 Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan starrer film 'piku' is being well liked by the people
 film kii story ‘piku’ yani deepika padukon or unke baba yani amitabh bachchan ke ird-gird gumti he
 But here we are talking about Parineeti, not 'piku'

 These days Parineeti Chopra is experiencing something similar
 jaise-jaise piku kii safalataa kaa graph bad rahaa he, pariniti ke dil kii baicheni bhi badhati ja rahi he
 The film is getting rave reviews as well as love from the audience
 asal main nirdeshak shujit sarkaar ne deepika se pehle piku kaa role pariniti ko ofer kiya tha, par pariniti ne shujit sarkaar ko is film main kaam karne se manaa kar diya
 Parineeti was then playing the lead role in the film 'daawat-e-ishq', which was based on the father-daughter story and was confident that Yash Raj Banner's film would definitely succeed
 saath hi, pariniti dobaaraa se pita-putree ke rishton par banane vaali filmein nahin karnaa chaahati thim
 So he refused to work in 'piku'
 pariniti kaa ye galat faisla deepika ke liye lucky sabit hua
 But now Parineeti has nothing left to regret

 Sibal said, 'we have elections

 Asked why his government did not go to court against the decision of the Central Information Commission (CIC), why did he choose to amend the law, Sibal said that since the order of the CIC is in force, immediate steps were required to be taken
 Therefore, the government is intending to bring a bill to remove the CIC order

 co / m61zcn8olu — Sibi (sathya) raj (@sibi_sathyaraj) March 11, 2018 Anushka's explanation for her marriage to Prabhas is the fact that Katappa's character became the most popular after the wait
 film kaa doosraa part aane tak sabake man main yahi sawaal uthta rahaa ki katappa ne bahubali ko kyon maaraa? soshal media par bhi yah sawaal trend main rahaa tha
 Katappa was forced to kill Bahubali at the behest of Rani Shivagami Devi
 is karactor se satyaraj ko duniyabar main pahchaan mili
 Bahubali proved to be a milestone in his career
 yadi varun kii fees 25 karod to prabhas ko kyon nahin mil sakate 20 karod?bataa den, bahubali saal 2017 kii sabase badi blockbster film bani
 The movie crossed the 1000 crore mark within 10 days of its release

 rajdhani dilli ke vivek vihaar main ek shaadishuda mahila se teen logon ne maaruti vine main rape kiya or phir use dilashaad garden main phenk diya
 See the extent of transcending humanity, this disgusting act was done in front of the woman's two-year-old son
 peedit mahila apane pati ke saath nandangari ilaake main kiraye ke makaan main rahati he
 There, both the husband and wife used to have a thong with the landlord Sonu
 mahila kaa aarope he ki aaropee sonu unhen kiraye ke naam par baar-baar tang karata tha
 Sonu's sister had also heard about the victim

 When the woman took her request to the police station, the police first refused to register an FIR

 uri main sena ke camp par hue aatanki hamale ko lekar nai dilli main baithkon kaa daur jari he
 The eyes of the countrymen are moist with the martyrdom of 17 soldiers in the attack of terrorists who have entered the border of Pakistan
 logon ke bich gussa bhi he
 If the political rulers are condemning and making statements, the people are expecting some concrete action from the government
 aise main dhai saal pehle aatankwaad or pakistan ko kadaa sabak sikhaane ke vaade ke saath satta main ai centre kii modi sarkaar ke saamne kya vikalp hai? kya pakistan sarkaar se baatcheet kii jaani chahie yaa phir pakistan par hamalaa kiya jaae? isaki padtaal karnaa jaruri he
 However, there are risks with these options, which cannot be ignored
 sargical hamalajaisa hamalaa america ne osama bin laden ko maarane ke liye kiya tha, bharat ke paas bhi vikalp he ki pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main chal raheatanki camponper hamale kiye jaae
 However, its biggest risk is that another war could erupt with the neighboring country and it is equipped with neighboring nuclear weapons
 seemaa main ghuskar hamalajun 2015 main manipur main ghaat lagaakar kiye gaye hamale main sena ke 18 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this the Indian Army entered the border of Myanmar and the terrorists were killed
 bharat pakistan main chhipe aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf is tarah ke vikalp par bhi vichaar kar saktaa he lekinpakistanke halaat myanmar se alag hai or pakistan ke khilaaf kabhi aisa kiya nahin kiya gaya he
 Isolation in the name of terror may make India another attempt to isolate Pakistan in the world fraternity by declaring it a terrorist country
 bharat haalanki dashakon se is tarah kii koshish kar rahaa he lekin is disha main badi kamyaabi nahin mili he
 Now that terrorism has emerged as a global threat, there is scope for India to benefit on the diplomatic front
 dwipaksheeya baatcheetbharat ko pakistan ke saath dobaar baatcheet kii shuruyaat kerani chahie
 However, this can only go against India because it is India's policy that terrorism and negotiation are not possible simultaneously
 pichley daravaaje se baatcheetjagajaahir he ki pakistan main satta par vahaan kisenaka dabadabaa rahata he, aise main pakistani sena se pichley daravaaje se baatcheet kaa vikalp bhi centre sarkaar ke paas he
 But the intention of the Pakistani Army is doubtful how much it will support India in the peace process
 yah vahi sena he, jisane sarkaar kaa takhtapalat kar satta hathiyaa lee thi
 Aggressive stance After the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, the deployment of security forces along the borders should be increased on the lines of 'operation Parakram' started by the then Vajpayee government
 pakistani vimaanon ko apane hawaii maarg se udaan kii ijaajat band kar deni chahie
 The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad should be called back and the Pakistan Mission in New Delhi should also be asked to leave his country
 haalanki is kadam se gharelu morche par kuch samay ke liye phayda to hoga, lambey samay ke liye yah phydemand nahin hoga
 PM Modi has tried to bring a new twist in India's foreign policy by striking the melody of Balochistan and pok, from the ramparts of Jaile Lal fort on Baluchistan
 baluchistan main bhi pakistan ke atyaachaar ke khilaaf awaajen phir se uthne lagi hai
 Leaders of Balochistan have also praised this initiative of India's leadership
 aise main uri hamale ke baad bharat ke paas baluchistan ko lekar pakistan ko ek baar phir gherne kaa vikalp he
 However, there is a risk that this may create an anti-india environment and this will strengthen the 'state' and 'non-state actors' of Pakistan
