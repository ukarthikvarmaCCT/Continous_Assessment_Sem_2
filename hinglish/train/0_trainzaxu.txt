 In an interview to a private TV channel, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata did not rule out the possibility of the party joining the UPA
 trinmul ne multibrands retail main pratyaksh videshi nivesh or dijal evam rasoi gas kii keemton kii vruddhi ke virodh main upie sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha

 When Mamata was asked if she could support the Congress after the next Lok Sabha elections, she said, "I cannot say anything about tomorrow's strategy
" party nirnay legi
 After withdrawing support, for the first time Mamta said in her interview that even though Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati have saved the UPA government, this government has lost its credibility
 mamata ne congress par satta hathiyaane ke liye paise evam mafiaon kaa sahyog lene kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 UPA government is very arrogant, he said that the Manmohan Singh government has lost its moral and democratic right to govern and political parties should decide to topple this 'very arrogant' government
 mamata ne kaha, ‘is sarkaar ne apane gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke saath kisi maamle par kabhi salaah mashwara nahin kiya
 Whatever they do, they do it quietly

 During his 15 years as a minister in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) government, Ramai Ram was known more for his hobbies of snakes, horses and monkeys and less for work
 ve apane ghode raja ko ghuddaudon main le jate, apane kandhe par bandar bithakar ghoomte hue unhen saarvajanik rup se dekha gaya or kai baar unka parampriy saanp unke gale main lipta bhi dikhataa tha
 His hobby matched that of the then political boss Lalu and his wife Rabri Devi, who kept many dogs, horses, cows and birds

 They prefer to work as per rules and on time

 Former RJD MLA and Rural Construction Minister, 49-year-old Bhim Singh was such a trusted assistant to Lalu that he made this mechanical engineer-turned-politician his personal secretary in the last phase of Rabri Devi's chief ministerial post
 bhim singh 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jad (you) main aae
 He was first rewarded by sending him to the Legislative Council and then to the post of minister after the nda's landslide victory in the 2010 assembly elections
 tab se bhim singh ne khud ko party or sarkaar ke liye puri tarah jhenk diya he
 On June 7, he got heat stroke while leading a mass campaign to demand special status for Bihar

 Apart from ministers, many senior JD (U) leaders like Sharad Yadav, Ranjan Yadav, Dinesh Chandra Yadav, Mangani Lal Mandal were once considered staunch supporters of Lalu

 "they have turned us into working ministers," says Razak
 '' lalu kaa saath chhodkar aane waalon ke saath bhi nitish lagaataar prayasarat rahete hai
 Both Ramai Ram and Rajak lost their by-elections in September 2009 in the seats they held as RJD mlas
 nitish ne donon ko ek baar phir 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kamyaabi se utaara or mantrimandal main shaamil kar liya
 Why is Nitish sticking with the same leaders? Is there a shortage of new political talent in Bihar? Or do they find it easier to work with their old friends and then become friends? Do they believe that this is part of their strategy to isolate Lalu by raising RJD veterans? Whatever the reasons, no one has objections as long as the functioning is going well

 INX media cese main karti ke pita pi chidambaram jail main hai bandaidi ne karti kii giraftaar se mili chhot ko HC main di chunautiaienex media cese main tihaad jail main band purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ke bete karti chidambaram se bhi is maamle main poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 According to information received by India Today, Karthi Chidambaram appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki karti chidambaram se ienex media maamle main poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 ED had summoned Karti Chidambaram and asked him to appear on Wednesday
 jab media ne karti chidambaram se unke idi ke daftar aane kaa kaaran poocha to karti chidambaram ne kaha, 'main yahaan sabko dashahara kii badhai dene aayaa hum
 Karthi Chidambaram and his father p Chidambaram are accused in the INX Media case
 purv kendriya vittamantri pi chidambaram ko haal hi main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Karti is currently protected from arrest in the case, which the ED has challenged in the High Court
 idi kaa kahana he ki jaanch kii prakriya puri karne ke liye karti chidambaram ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne kii jarurat he
 However, Karthi Chidambaram is denying the ed's allegations that he influenced INX Media's deal through his father p Chidambaram, who was then finance minister
 sibiai or idi kaa aarope he ki karti chidambaram indrani mukherjee se mili the or ienex media deal ko prabhavit karne ke liye pi chidambaram ke saath unki meeting karai thi

 ye aarope puri tarah jhuthe hai
 This is nothing but political vendetta, as my father has been very vocal in his criticism of the government
 'haal hi main jaanch agency ne ek sansanikhej daawa kiya tha ki pi chidambaram se milane gayi indrani mukherjee kii entry ko visitors log book se mitaa diya gaya
 Karti said in a tweet, 'is the BJP government saying that my father deleted the visitor log book of the Finance Ministry for the FIR lodged in 2017? When the FIR was filed, whose government was it then? Will they file a new FIR to destroy government records? Are they serious that the former finance minister went to the finance ministry after 2017 and destroyed the log book records? Whose Government was it at that time? ”karti says that if the ED has any evidence against him, then why are they not presenting the charge sheet against him? p Chidambaram was arrested by the CBI on 21 August and since September 5, he is in judicial custody in Tihar Jail

 In Gujarat, the schools of 'gujarat Board' have just started from Monday, but in the beginning, the students of Primary School have got a big shock
 gujarat board ke skool kii kitabon ke daam dogune se bhi zyada bad gaye hai
 These books are printed by the State Government Text Book Board
 primary kii sabhi kitabon kii keemten dogune se bhi zyada badi hai
 The parents of the children say that there has already been an increase in the school uniforms to school fees and in this case the school board has also disturbed them by increasing the books
 haalanki middle class ke chaatro ko shaayad ye mahangaai itani nahin pareshaan karegi, jitani garib chaatro ko
 People say that this will have an impact on the education of poor students
 vipakshi dal congress kaa aarope he ki rajya sarkaar in kitabon kii quality par dhyaan nahin de rahi he
 Every year many mistakes are found in these books and the quality of paper used in them is also falling
 sarkaar use sudhaar nahin rahi he, lekin daam badha rahi he
 The comments lekin sarkari kitaaben banane ke zimmedaar skool text books board ke adhyaksh nitin khetaani kaa kahana he ki 10 saal se unhone kitabon ke daam nahin badaye the or itane samay main mahangaai bahut bad gai he
 Therefore, there was no option but to increase the price
 daam to bad gaye hai, kahin isse bacchon kii padhai hi khatai main naa pad jaae, vaise bhi gujarat shiksha ke kshetra main pichhada hua he or sarkaar ko is maamle main badi jimmedaari se kaam lenaa hoga

 However, this inflation may not bother the middle class students as much as the poor students
 logon kaa kahana he ki garib chaatro kii padhai par iskaa asar padegaa
 The opposition party alleges that the state government is not paying attention to the quality of these books
 har saal in kitabon main kai galtiyaan pai jaati hai or inamen upyog kiye jane vaale kagaz kii quality bhi gir rahi he
 The government is not improving it, but is increasing the price
 tippaniyan But Nitin Khetani, president of the Board of School Text Books responsible for making government books, says that he had not increased the prices of books for 10 years and inflation has increased a lot in that time
 isliye daam badhaane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 Prices have increased, so that it does not hurt the education of children, anyway, Gujarat is backward in the field of education and the government will have to act with great responsibility in this matter

 The BJP came out on the streets ahead of HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in ceremony in Karnataka
 bijepi ne kumaraswami ke shapath grahan samaaroh kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa termed the congress-jds coalition government as immoral
 yediurppa haathon main kaali pattee baandhakar kumaraswami ke shapath grahan ke virodh main bengalooru main gandhi samadhi par baithe hai
 Many leaders of karnatakabjp unit are sitting on a protest against Yeddyurappa against Gandhi's new government at Gandhi Samadhi
 sabhi netaa haath main kaali pattee baandhakar kumaraswami sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karne baithe hai
 BJP spokesperson Malvika, in conversation with 'aaj Tak', termed the new government of Karnataka as chance and immoral
 malvika kaa kahana he ki karnataka kii janata ne congress kii sarkaar or jedies ko nakaarte hue bijepi ko 104 siten di
 But because of seven seats falling short, the Congress and JDS formed an unethical alliance to prevent the BJP from forming the government
 vahiin yediurppa ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo gaanv-gaanv jaakar logon kokarnataka keenai sarkaar ke khilaaf janadesh kaa apmaan karne ke khilaaf jaagrit karenge
 Please tell, HD Kumaraswamy this evening 4
 30 baje karnataka ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 Along with him, Karnataka Congress President g Parameshwara will be sworn in as Deputy CM
 vidhansabha ke spikar kaa pad bhi congress ko mila he, jabaki dipti spikar jedies se hoga
 These leaders will be included: Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi besides BSP chief Mayawati, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Trinamool Congress leader Mamta Banerjee, Tejashwi Yadav, DMK leader Kanimozhi among others
 Veteran leaders are expected to attend
 kumaraswami ne sabhi kshetreey netaaon ko vyaktigat taur par samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya he
 Let me tell you that Tejashwi Yadav and Mamta Banerjee have already reached Bengaluru to participate in the oath taking
 dekhte rahierwaish kumaquentika prakaashan, shalimaar garden, gajiabad-5,keemtah 130 ru
 The question is also on its own ground: During the era of Ravish Kumarmuktibodh, Raghuveer Sahai or Sarveshwar Dayal Saxena, there was often a debate about journalism and writing about how language and images should be there
 bhashaa aam jan kii ho yaa satta ko samaj main aane vaali ho
 The images should be the ones to provoke the contradiction of power or like a string tied to the common man's nappies
 70-80 ke daur main bahes to patrakarita kii bhashaa main sahitya kaa put khojane kii bhi thi or bina sahitya ke patrakarita 'kitni adhuri yaa kitni puri' ko lekar bhi bahes hoti rahati thi
 That is, that round was of concern
 jahaan samvaad main rishton se lekar saanskrithik or saamaajik parivesh kaa mishran kisi ras kii tarah ghulaa rahata tha
 That rasa remained intact during Dinman and Sunday journalism
 patna kii baadh par fanishwarnath renu kii dinmaan kii reporting sahitya or patrakarita kaa adbhut mishran he
 Which readers liked so much that this report came in the form of a book called debtal-dhanjal
 lekin sawaal he ki ab ke daur main dhul se sane, patrakarita ke in pannon ko kuredne kii jarurat kyon padi he? yah sawaal kisi bhi pathak ke jehan main khadaa ho saktaa he
 So keep looking at Ravish Kumar's book, the language and image that Bimba set in the run-up to journalism, in the same way, it also compelled us to feel the tickle of journalistic concerns while communicating with journalism
 raveesh tivi patrkaar hai or news channel kii patrakarita kaise haaf rahi he, iske liye kaagaj kaala karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Ravish too is seen floating in this rave
 lekin dhara ke viruddh tairne kii jis adaa ko unhone viksit kiya he vah tivi se zyada lekhan main ubhartee he
 Even though the screen of the news channel is not the result of one's thinking, but the writing is personal
 or uske peeche jab patrakarita kii samoochee malgadee se jujhte hue koi patrkaar tatkaal main hi send lagane ko amada ho to kaise-kaise bimb or kaise samvaad ubharate hai, yah dekhte rahiye main dekhne ko miltaa he
 There is also uneasiness within Ravish, who wants to see India in the bones of the wooden cart, smiling at the sky of development
 bill gates ke srujanaatmak poonjeevaad main kaise dihadi majdoor kii anti main rakhe paanch-das rupye bhi samaa sakate hai or kaise shani chalisa sakal jagat main dhak jamaaye baithi he
 Ravish is holding a tail with any object, but the way he slowly moves in the direction of catching the trunk, it can be felt to keep in view
 hamaare ird-gird kii koi bhi cheez chaahe vah pizza ho yaa sattu
 Raveesh's pen explains in a few words the entire marketing of the fast food curated market
 dekhte rahiye saamaajik sidhiyon par bhi chadhati he or tivi ke jariye brands banaate samaaj ko bhi aainaa dikhaati he
 That is, in the era of information revolution, on every palm, the dialogue has become like a short line, keep looking at it, by creating a new definition in the way of looking at the line, we want to embody the feeling that information does not mean truth
 soochna sarokaar bhi nahin he
 Information is just business and if you are not in the business of getting stuck in the chakravyuh of the business, then you cannot get more than the dead fish flowing in the stream
 dekhte rahiye main yah ehsaas baar-baar kisi bhi tivi patrkaar ko chhu saktaa he
 Ravish recognizes his land and is seen repeatedly examining the pen around the same image like a camera lens
 bhashaa satta kii nahin he
 The images belong to the common man, which is different from the hands of the Congress and also different from the mud under the lotus of the BJP
 andaaj shahar main rahete hue peeche chhod aae gaanv ke dard kaa he
 And this writing is a product of social media, which has come out in the form of this book by shaking the column written in the blog town
 dekhte rahiye ko dekhnaa isliye chahie kyonki isi kitaab main raveesh ne apni jameen par bhi sawaal uthaae hai: angreji ho yaa hindi ho yaa phir gujarati / ghanta khaak nahin maaloom / jhaade chale jate hai bokaraati / band karo ab tivi ko / tivi saalaa khataal he / doodh jitna na bikta / usase basi gobar kaa pahaad he
 Keep watching, have a look

 jepi nadda ne kaha "jab achaanak is tarah ke maamle saamne aate hai to bed kii kami jaisi samasya aati he

 He was criticized a lot in the IPL, but even then i said that i trust his captaincy

 In such a situation, why would anyone pay attention to Chatki Kali in a small country called Tunisia with a population less than one and a quarter million
 lekin janaa chahie
 Do you remember the incident which took place almost nine years ago, when a vegetable handler raised a voice against the injustice of the local police, and upon seeing it took such a fierce form that the President of the country had to flee the country
 Was lying
 yah desh tha - tunisia
 And from this little country, the revolution that the country had made for democracy, it was called 'arab Spring' - where 'spring' means revolution, not spring
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki yah arab kranti is desh tak hi simit nahin rahi
 Its flames ranged from Egypt, Morocco and Libya in Africa to Yemen, Bahrain in Central Asia and Syria and Jordan in West Asia, and reached well
 nau saal baad ek baar phir tunisia ne in arab deshon ke saamne loktantr kaa sundar udhaaharan pesh kiya he

 If Tunisia could become a source of interest and inspiration for other Arab nations, the democratic governments of these countries would be able to help India more closely in its relations
 isse bharat pakistan ke viruddh us kshetra main ek shakti santulan sthapit karne main sakasham ho sakegaa
 It is noteworthy that India imports 65 percent of its crude oil from Middle East Asia itself, and about 65 lakh Indians are living in these countries
 philhal, tunisia ke saamne ek yah chunauti zaruri he ki vah apane yahaan raashtrapati ke chunaav ko kitne shantipurna tareeke se sampann kara paata he

 jiske baad kai or sanghathan bhi isaki mukhaalafat main utar aae
 Now politicians have also openly come out against the film

 We did schoolfee @ ndtv

 We have received e-mails from many states, districts and cities and villages
 sabane i-mail karte vakt lut shabd kaa koob istemaal kiya he or ek nayaa shabd skulon ke sandarbh main aa rahaa he
 Slaughterhouse kai i-mail main kaha gaya he ki skool boojadkhaane se bhi badtar he
 So these are the schools of their imagination, who are crying and sending their children to the same abattoir
 saikadon i-mail padhanaa mumkin to nahin he magar kaiyon ko padhate vakt laga ki mata pita kaaphi darate hai
 Many people are careful not to know the name, many have not given the name and many have created new ids to match
 ek janaab ne to america ne haal hi main bam giraaya he usee ke naam par i-mail banaakar apni vyathaa bheji he
 Under the name Mother of All Bombs
 dheron i-mail se pataa chalata he ki skool chaahe saansad kaa ho, sena ke purv adhikari kaa ho, vyapaaree kaa ho yaa phir media gharaane waalon kaa ho, sab main mata pita kii majaburi kaa phayda uthaaya ja rahaa he
 Tapping is also the same in schools of media houses
 srinagar jahaan din raat hangaamaa he vahaan bhi skool vaale usee tarah vasuul rahe hai jis tarah se bharat ke skool vaale

 hamen pataa he ki bharat main achche privet skool hai
 Those who are good schools do not have to be hurt by our public hearing
 ham baat un skulon kii kar rahe hai jo anaap shanaap tareeke se paise lete hai
 a mail appealed to Prime Minister Modi that a surgical strike on schools has become necessary
 kisi skool ko anumati nahin he ki wo uniform yaa kitaab kii kachi raseed de
 Take a fee in cash
 ye sab tex chori ke liye ho rahaa he
 We have not been able to independently verify the claims made in the e-mails but while reading these, it seems that they are being punished for teaching in private schools
 i-mail ko padhate hue ham vasuuli ke kuch udhaaharan aapke liye chune hai
 a school in Rajkot took 1500 for a yoga mat of 250
 jorhat, assam ke skool main hereband ke liye 100 rupaya liya gaya

 Our viewer Vikramjit has told that there is only one school uniform in China
 vahaan bachche trek suut pahante hai
 Swati has written that she has recently come to India from India
 yahaan koi skool uniform nahin hota he
 In India, we were suffering exploitation of schools
 bharat main bhi kuch skulon main nursery ke bachche ko skool uniform nahin lagata he
 There is only one such school in Delhi, there is no uniform for two years of nursery
 skool kahata he ki baccha purana kapadaa hi pahanakar aae vahi uchit hoga
 But i will not talk about two to four good schools
 main bharat ke tamaam shaharon main skulon ke bheetar ho rahi lut kii baat kar rahaa hum
 First of all i want to talk about a mail from Rajkot regarding teacher's salary
 agar is email kii soochna sahi he to rajkot kaa ek skool adhik selary teacher ke acount main jamaa karata he
 All teacher's atms are with the school management
 unka password bhi
 Management withdraws money after salary is deposited
 aisa hi ek mail upi se aayaa tha ki check pehle le lete hai, teacher ke acount main paisa jamaa hota he or nikaal liya jaataa he
 This is the teacher's condition
 skool main padhaane vaale mata-pita bhi dare hue hai
 Teacher is also scared
 skulon ke zariye logon par gulaami thopi ja rahi he
 Now come to the transport
 bason main suraksha niyamon ke paalan main baari laaparvaahee kii shikaayat ai hai
 In buses with capacity of 50, 100-100 children are sent to the room
 bason main first aid kit nahin rakhi hoti he
 Buses also have poor maintenance
 bas chaalak sadak niyamon kaa paalan nahin karte
 The Supreme Court has also given broad instructions regarding the safety of school buses
 kai skool paalan bhi karte hai or zyaadaatar nahin bhi karte hai
 For example, if a bus or van is hired for a school, it should be written on school duty
 bas ke dryver kii uniform bhi tay kar di gai he
 According to the Supreme Court, the driver should have a list of all the children boarding the bus
 jisamen bacchon ke naam, class, ghar kaa pataa, blad gup, stoppage, root plane hona chahie
 The windows of the bus should have horizontal grills
 bas main aag bujhane vaala upkaran hona anivaary he
 It is mandatory to write the school name and telephone number on the bus
 skool bas main kam se kam ek atendent hona chahie
 School buses should have speed governors
 skool kii gaadi kaa rang haive yelo hona chahie or bich main 150 mem kii hari pattee chaaron ore bichon bich honi chahie
 If school children are less than 12 years, then more than one and a half times the capacity of the bus should not be taken
 tippaniyan Nowadays many schools have started buying yellow bus but many children still go by van
 bas kaa kiraaya tay karne kaa koi sarvamaanya formula nahin he
 In any school, even if the house is 100 meters away, it is mandatory to go by bus
 aisa kuch mata pita ne i-mail kar bataaya he
 We have understood the accounting of buses from a transport officer
 42 seater bas kaa udhaaharan lete hue unhone bataaya ki ek saamaanya skool bas ek litre deazal main 5 kilometre chalati he
 For example, one such bus commutes forty kilometers every day
 is tarah ek din main aath litre deazal kii khapat hoti he
 If the school runs for 25 days of the month, which usually does not happen, then (25X8) = 200 liters of diesel is used on a bus
 60 rupee litre ke hisaab se ek bas main 12,000 rupee kaa har maheene deazal lagegaa
 Put a maintenance cost of Rs 5000 on it every month
 bas ke chah tair saath hazaar ke aate hai, to is mad main paanch hazaar rupye har maheene laga dijie
 Driver's salary - 15000, Helper salary - 6000
 is tarah ek gaadi par har maheene 43000 rupye laagat ai
 43000 = (12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 har din chalis kimi kii duuri tay karne vaali ek bas par har maheene ausatan 43,000 kaa karch aata he
 This does not include the bus installment
 maan lijie 30,000 rupee kist hoti he bas kii
 So according to this, the total cost of the bus will be 73 thousand rupees every month
 agar bas main 42 bachche hi safar karte hai to ek maheene main bas ke liye 1738 rupee kaa kharch aayega
 But we have seen that even for distances of 500 meters to two km, school buses charge two to three thousand or more in the name of fees

 Children there wear track suits
 swati ne likhaa he ki ve haal hi main bharat se america ain hai
 There is no school uniform here
 bharat main hamen skulon kaa shoshan bhugatna pad rahaa tha
 Even in India, in some schools, the nursery child does not find school uniform
 dilli main hi ek aisa skool he, nursery ke do saal tak koi uniform nahin he
 The school says that the child should be wearing the same old clothes as it is appropriate
 lekin main do chaar achche skulon kii baat nahin karuunga
 i am talking about the loot happening within schools in all cities of India
 pehle teacher kii selary ko lekar rajkot se aae ek mail kii baat karnaa chahta hum
 If the information in this email is correct, then a school in Rajkot deposits more salary in the account of the teacher
 sabhi teacher kaa atm skool prabandhan ke paas he
 Their password too
 selary jamaa hone ke baad prabandhan paisa nikaal letaa he
 One such mail came from UP that checks are taken first, money is deposited in the teacher's account and withdrawn
 ye teacher kii haalat he
 Parents who teach in school are also scared
 teacher bhi dare hue hai
 Slavery is being imposed on people through schools
 ab aa jate hai transport par
 There have been complaints of heavy negligence in the buses in following the safety rules
 50 kii kshamta vaali bason main 100-100 bachche thuns kar bheje jate hai
 Buses do not have a First Aid Kit
 bason kaa rakrakhaav bhi karaab hota he
 Bus drivers do not follow the road rules
 skool bason kii suraksha ko lekar supreme court ne vyapak nirdesh bhi diye hai
 Many schools also follow and most do not
 jaise kisi skool ke liye bas yaa vine kiraaye par lee jaaegi to us par on skool duty likhaa hona chahie
 The uniform of the driver of the bus has also been fixed
 supreme court ke anusaar driver ke paas bas main savaar sabhi bacchon kii ek suchi honi chahie
 Which should contain children's names, class, home address, blood group, stoppage, root plan
 bas kii khidakiyon par horizontal grills honi chahie
 It is mandatory to have a fire extinguisher in the bus
 bas par skool kaa naam or telephone number likhaa hona anivaary he
 The school bus must have at least one attendant
 skool bason main speed governor lage hone chahie
 The color of the school car should be highway yellow and the 150 mm green strip in the middle should be in the middle
 agar schuli bacchon kii umr 12 saal se kam he to bas kii kshamta ke dedh guna se zyaada bachche nahin le jaae jane chahie
 The comments aaj kal kai skool pili vaali bas to kharidne lage hai magar bahut se bachche abhi bhi vine se hi jate hai
 There is no universally accepted formula for deciding the fare of a bus
 kisi kisi skool main to ghar 100 meter dur he phir bhi bas se janaa anivaary he
 Some such parents have told by email
 hamane ek parivahan adhikari se bason kaa hisaab kitaab samajha he
 Taking the example of a 42 seater bus, he said that a normal school bus runs 5 kilometers in a liter of diesel
 udhaaharan ke liye aisi ek bas har rose chalis kilometre kaa aana-janaa karti he
 In this way, eight liters of diesel is consumed in a day
 agar skool maheene ke 25 din chalata he jo aam taur par nahin hota, to (25X8) = 200 litre deazal ek bas main lagata he
 According to 60 rupees a liter, a bus will cost diesel of Rs 12,000 per month
 is par har maheene 5000 rupee kii mentinence cost laga dijie
 Six tires of the bus come for sixty thousand, so put five thousand rupees every month on this item
 driver kii selary - 15000, helper kii selary - 6000
 In this way, a train cost 43000 rupees every month
 43000 = ( 12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 a bus traveling a distance of forty km every day costs an average of 43,000 per month
 isamen bas kii kist shaamil nahin he
 Suppose Rs 30,000 is the installment of the bus
 to is hisaab se har maheene bas kii kul laagat padegi 73 hazaar rupye
 If only 42 children travel in a bus, then a bus will cost Rs 1738 in a month
 lekin hamane dekha he ki 500 meter se lekar do kimi kii duuri ke liye bhi skool bas fees ke naam par do se teen hazaar yaa usase bhi adhik lete hai
 a parent from Guwahati has written that last year when we started the movement, the fees in the school did not increase this year, but this year the school has taken Rs 1500 for a book of history
 agar unka daawa sahi he to hamen shame aani chahie
 Our viewer Vikramjit has told that there is only one school uniform in China
 vahaan bachche trek suut pahante hai
 Swati has written that she has recently come to India from India
 yahaan koi skool uniform nahin hota he
 In India, we were suffering exploitation of schools
 bharat main bhi kuch skulon main nursery ke bachche ko skool uniform nahin lagata he
 There is only one such school in Delhi, there is no uniform for two years of nursery
 skool kahata he ki baccha purana kapadaa hi pahanakar aae vahi uchit hoga
 But i will not talk about two to four good schools
 main bharat ke tamaam shaharon main skulon ke bheetar ho rahi lut kii baat kar rahaa hum
 First of all i want to talk about a mail from Rajkot regarding teacher's salary
 agar is email kii soochna sahi he to rajkot kaa ek skool adhik selary teacher ke acount main jamaa karata he
 All teacher's atms are with the school management
 unka password bhi
 Management withdraws money after salary is deposited
 aisa hi ek mail upi se aayaa tha ki check pehle le lete hai, teacher ke acount main paisa jamaa hota he or nikaal liya jaataa he
 This is the teacher's condition
 skool main padhaane vaale mata-pita bhi dare hue hai
 Teacher is also scared
 skulon ke zariye logon par gulaami thopi ja rahi he
 Now come to the transport
 bason main suraksha niyamon ke paalan main baari laaparvaahee kii shikaayat ai hai
 In buses with capacity of 50, 100-100 children are sent to the room
 bason main first aid kit nahin rakhi hoti he
 Buses also have poor maintenance
 bas chaalak sadak niyamon kaa paalan nahin karte
 The Supreme Court has also given broad instructions regarding the safety of school buses
 kai skool paalan bhi karte hai or zyaadaatar nahin bhi karte hai
 For example, if a bus or van is hired for a school, it should be written on school duty
 bas ke dryver kii uniform bhi tay kar di gai he
 According to the Supreme Court, the driver should have a list of all the children boarding the bus
 jisamen bacchon ke naam, class, ghar kaa pataa, blad gup, stoppage, root plane hona chahie
 The windows of the bus should have horizontal grills
 bas main aag bujhane vaala upkaran hona anivaary he
 It is mandatory to write the school name and telephone number on the bus
 skool bas main kam se kam ek atendent hona chahie
 School buses should have speed governors
 skool kii gaadi kaa rang haive yelo hona chahie or bich main 150 mem kii hari pattee chaaron ore bichon bich honi chahie
 If school children are less than 12 years, then more than one and a half times the capacity of the bus should not be taken
 tippaniyan Nowadays many schools have started buying yellow bus but many children still go by van
 bas kaa kiraaya tay karne kaa koi sarvamaanya formula nahin he
 In any school, even if the house is 100 meters away, it is mandatory to go by bus
 aisa kuch mata pita ne i-mail kar bataaya he
 We have understood the accounting of buses from a transport officer
 42 seater bas kaa udhaaharan lete hue unhone bataaya ki ek saamaanya skool bas ek litre deazal main 5 kilometre chalati he
 For example, one such bus commutes forty kilometers every day
 is tarah ek din main aath litre deazal kii khapat hoti he
 If the school runs for 25 days of the month, which usually does not happen, then (25X8) = 200 liters of diesel is used on a bus
 60 rupee litre ke hisaab se ek bas main 12,000 rupee kaa har maheene deazal lagegaa
 Put a maintenance cost of Rs 5000 on it every month
 bas ke chah tair saath hazaar ke aate hai, to is mad main paanch hazaar rupye har maheene laga dijie
 Driver's salary - 15000, Helper salary - 6000
 is tarah ek gaadi par har maheene 43000 rupye laagat ai
 43000 = (12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 har din chalis kimi kii duuri tay karne vaali ek bas par har maheene ausatan 43,000 kaa karch aata he
 This does not include the bus installment
 maan lijie 30,000 rupee kist hoti he bas kii
 So according to this, the total cost of the bus will be 73 thousand rupees every month
 agar bas main 42 bachche hi safar karte hai to ek maheene main bas ke liye 1738 rupee kaa kharch aayega
 But we have seen that even for distances of 500 meters to two km, school buses charge two to three thousand or more in the name of fees
 ab aa jate hai transport par
 There have been complaints of heavy negligence in the buses in following the safety rules
 50 kii kshamta vaali bason main 100-100 bachche thuns kar bheje jate hai
 Buses do not have a First Aid Kit
 bason kaa rakrakhaav bhi karaab hota he
 Bus drivers do not follow the road rules
 skool bason kii suraksha ko lekar supreme court ne vyapak nirdesh bhi diye hai
 Many schools also follow and most do not
 jaise kisi skool ke liye bas yaa vine kiraaye par lee jaaegi to us par on skool duty likhaa hona chahie
 The uniform of the driver of the bus has also been fixed
 supreme court ke anusaar driver ke paas bas main savaar sabhi bacchon kii ek suchi honi chahie
 Which should contain children's names, class, home address, blood group, stoppage, root plan
 bas kii khidakiyon par horizontal grills honi chahie
 It is mandatory to have a fire extinguisher in the bus
 bas par skool kaa naam or telephone number likhaa hona anivaary he
 The school bus must have at least one attendant
 skool bason main speed governor lage hone chahie
 The color of the school car should be highway yellow and the 150 mm green strip in the middle should be in the middle
 agar schuli bacchon kii umr 12 saal se kam he to bas kii kshamta ke dedh guna se zyaada bachche nahin le jaae jane chahie
 The comments aaj kal kai skool pili vaali bas to kharidne lage hai magar bahut se bachche abhi bhi vine se hi jate hai
 There is no universally accepted formula for deciding the fare of a bus
 kisi kisi skool main to ghar 100 meter dur he phir bhi bas se janaa anivaary he
 Some such parents have told by email
 hamane ek parivahan adhikari se bason kaa hisaab kitaab samajha he
 Taking the example of a 42 seater bus, he said that a normal school bus runs 5 kilometers in a liter of diesel
 udhaaharan ke liye aisi ek bas har rose chalis kilometre kaa aana-janaa karti he
 In this way, eight liters of diesel is consumed in a day
 agar skool maheene ke 25 din chalata he jo aam taur par nahin hota, to (25X8) = 200 litre deazal ek bas main lagata he
 According to 60 rupees a liter, a bus will cost diesel of Rs 12,000 per month
 is par har maheene 5000 rupee kii mentinence cost laga dijie
 Six tires of the bus come for sixty thousand, so put five thousand rupees every month on this item
 driver kii selary - 15000, helper kii selary - 6000
 In this way, a train cost 43000 rupees every month
 43000 = ( 12000 + 5000 + 5000 + 15000 + 6000)
 a bus traveling a distance of forty km every day costs an average of 43,000 per month
 isamen bas kii kist shaamil nahin he
 Suppose Rs 30,000 is the installment of the bus
 to is hisaab se har maheene bas kii kul laagat padegi 73 hazaar rupye
 If only 42 children travel in a bus, then a bus will cost Rs 1738 in a month
 lekin hamane dekha he ki 500 meter se lekar do kimi kii duuri ke liye bhi skool bas fees ke naam par do se teen hazaar yaa usase bhi adhik lete hai
 Nowadays many schools have started buying yellow bus but many children still go by van
 bas kaa kiraaya tay karne kaa koi sarvamaanya formula nahin he
 In any school, even if the house is 100 meters away, it is mandatory to go by bus
 aisa kuch mata pita ne i-mail kar bataaya he

 Ali's lawyer LK Verma told the court that the crime branch of the Delhi Police refused to believe his client in his status report submitted to the court, while relying only on his testimony in the vote-for-vote case
 alke verma ne kaha, ‘ek taraf 2008 ke note ke badale vot maamle main police hashamat ali ke bayaan par bharosa kar rahi he, vahiin duusari taraf ve unpar or unki shikaayat par vishwaas nahin kar rahe
 The lawyer said that Ali was kidnapped from Khan Market and taken to Amar Singh's residence where the former Samajwadi Party leader slapped him and snatched away his mobile phone
 verma ne kaha ki usee din media kii upasthiti main unhen police ke hawaale kiya gaya
 Ali's lawyer said that the police did not properly investigate his client's complaint and sought to dismiss it in his status report
 adaalat ne daleelon ko sunne ke baad ali kii yachika par apana aadesh 12 disambar tak ke liye surakshit rakhaa
 In its status report, the police said that the petition had no merit and that the oraps were not confirmed

 Top Congress leaders are angry with Nitish Kumar's stance on the presidential election
 ve is baat se zyada naaraaz nahin hai ki nitish ne endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind ko samarthan diya
 More resentment is that a day before the important meeting of the Opposition, the way Ramnath Kovind's support and Congress President Sonia Gandhi announced not to attend the meeting, many questions are being raised

 Congress sources said that Nitish refused

 The comments sutron ke mutabik- congress party ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki nitish ke is kadam se vipaksh ko jhatka laga he
 Nitish's idea of bringing non-nda parties on one stage was and he cheated us, just like you invite someone to dinner, but when your guests come, you leave the house
 netaaon ne yah bhi kaha ki vah congress party hi thi jisane nitish ko mahagathbandhan ke netaa ke rup main bahut pehle sweekaar kiya tha or lalu or unki party ko apane rukh kaa samarthan karne ke liye majaboor kiya tha

 haalanki isse saaf he ki congress or nitish ke bich tanaav or avishvaas kii lakeer khinch gai he
 According to sources- Congress Party leaders say that Nitish's move has shocked the opposition
 gaiyr endie partiyon ko ek manch par laane kaa idia nitish kaa tha or unhone hamen hi dhokhaa de diya, thik usee tarah jaise aap kisi ko ghar khaane ke liye aamantrit karte hai , lekin jab aapke mehmaan aate hai to aap ghar se nikal jate hai
 The leaders also said that it was the Congress party that had long accepted Nitish as the leader of the grand alliance and forced Lalu and his party to support his stand
 sutron ke mutabik- chennai main jab diemke pramukh karunanidhi ke janmdin ke liye nitish kumaar gaye the tab congress or vam dalon ke netaaon se baatcheet hui thi or gopalkrishna gandhi ko vipaksh kaa ummidavaar banaaen jane kaa prastaav diya gaya tha lekin congress party us ore baithi rahi thi
 However, it is clear that the line of tension and mistrust between Congress and Nitish has been drawn

 If you take a look at the trailer, it will be known that he has been given credit as a screenplay writer

 a source says that Dilip Shukla was duly credited in the screen teaser released on September 11 along with Prabhudheva and Alok Upadhyay in the screenplay
 haalanki, jab ek maheene baad trailor jari kiya gaya, to dilip kaa naam salmaan khan ke naam se riples kar diya gaya
 Salman Khan, Prabhudheva and Alok Upadhyay were given credits as new screenplays
 vahiin dialog credit main unka naam barkaraar rakhaa gaya he
 Many famous dialogues written by Dilip Shukla have written dialogues for films like Damini and Ghayal
 unka kahana he, 'maine 'dhai kilo kaa haath' or 'taarikh par taarikh' jaise dialog likhe hai
 If i am not honored after doing such quality work, why would i bother getting my name removed from credit? ' bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa maananaa he ki ek-divasiy cricket ke nae niyamon ke kaaran adhiktar tiimon ke ravaiye main badlaav dikhegaa or ho saktaa he ki ballebaaj shuruaati overon main gendbaajon par haaavee nahin hon
 "I think most teams will change their attitude," Dhoni told reporters on the eve of the inaugural Champions Trophy match against South Africa
 ve pehle 10 overon main apane wicket bachaae rakhane ko tarjeeh denge, kyonki nai gend se gendbaajon ko madad mil sakati he
 "two new balls will be used after the new rules come into force and there will be less of a fielder inside the 30-yard circle, which means that if you have wickets left in your hand, you will actually benefit from the conditions," he said
 Can lift and score more runs
 australia ko duusare abhyaas match main 65 ran par dher karne ke liye dhoni ne apane gendbaajon kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, in the last match, we performed brilliantly with the new ball
 unhen bahut swing mil rahi thi, lekin iske saath hi gendon main kaaphi teji bhi thi
 The ball was passing very close to the off-stump mark which is important
 hamaare sabhi gendbaajon ne aisa kiya
 If you look at the whole picture, i think it is a good performance
 bharat se ravaanaa hone se pehle dhoni ne paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko rakhane par jor diya tha or unhone phir se yah baat doharaai
 The comments unhone kaha, nae niyamon ke kaaran chaar gendbaajon ke saath khelnaa or kaamchalaoo gendbaaj par bharosa karnaa bahut mushkil he
 Dhoni also praised Dinesh Karthik, who scored centuries in both practice matches
 unhone kaha, meraa hameshaa maanata rahaa hum ki vah aisa ballebaaj he, jo madhyakram main vastav main bahut acchhee ballebaaji kar saktaa he
 The reason for this is that he is a good runner
 vah sthiti ko acchhee tarah se bhaanp letaa he or vah aisa ballebaaj jo lambii pari khel saktaa he jo ki madhyakram ke ballebaaj ke liye mahatvapurn he
 My personal opinion is that it is good for the team
 dhoni ne kaha, vah aisa khilaadi he, jo 3, 4 yaa 5 kisi bhi number par ballebaaji kar saktaa he, lekin chathe yaa saatven number par nahin
 So i will try to send the players to their favorite place, but will also see what the team needs
 bharat ke salaami ballebaajon murali vijay or shikhar dhawan ne bhale hi ran nahin banaae, lekin captain ko un par puraa vishwaas he
 He said, we need to watch his entire performance and not worry
 yah kayaas lagaana sahi nahin he ki ve acha pradarshan karenge yaa nahin
 Dhoni said that the role of Indian fast bowlers will be important, in which Umesh Yadav's performance will be important
 dhoni ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf champions trophy ke udghaatan match kii purv sandhya par patrakaron se kaha, mujhe lagata he ki adhiktar timen apane ravaiye main badlaav karengi
 They would prefer to save their wickets in the first 10 overs, as the new ball can help the bowlers
 unhone kaha, nae niyamon ke lagu hone ke baad do nai gendon kaa upyog kiya jayega or iske alaava 30 gaj ke ghere ke andar ek kshetrarakshak kam rahegaa, jiskaa matlab he ki yadi aapke haath main wicket bache hai, to aap vastav main paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaakar adhik ran bana sakate hai
 Dhoni praised his bowlers for putting Australia on 65 for the second practice match
 unhone kaha, pichley match main nai gend se hamane shandaar pradarshan kiya
 He was getting a lot of swing, but at the same time balls were also very fast
 gend of stump ke mark ke kaaphi kareeb se hokar guzar rahi thi jo ki mahatvapurn he
 All our bowlers did that
 yadi aap sampurna tasviir par gaur karen, to main samajhataa hum ki yah acha pradarshan he
 Before leaving India, Dhoni insisted on having five specialist bowlers and he reiterated this
 tippaniyan "due to the new rules, it is very difficult to play with four bowlers and trust a caretaker
" dhoni ne dinesh karthik kii bhi jamkar tarif kii, jinhone donon abhyaas maichon main shatak jamaaye
 He said, i have always believed that he is a batsman who can bat really well in the middle order
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki vah acha ranor he
 He understands the situation well and a batsman who can play long innings which is important for the middle-order batsman
 meri nijee raay he ki uskaa hona team ke liye acha he
 Dhoni said, he is a player who can bat at any number 3, 4 or 5, but not at number six or seventh
 isliye main khilaadiyon ko unke pasandida sthaan par bhejne kii koshish karuunga, lekin yah bhi dekhuunga kii ki team kii jarurat kya he
 India's openers Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan may not have scored, but the captain has full faith in them
 unhone kaha, hamen unke sampurna pradarshan ko dekhne or chintaa nahin karne kii jarurat he
 It is not right to speculate whether they will perform well or not
 dhoni ne kaha ki bhartiya tej gendbaajon kii bhoomika ahm rahegi, jisamen umesh yadav kaa pradarshan mahatvapurn hoga
 "two new balls will be used after the new rules come into force and there will be less of a fielder inside the 30-yard circle, which means that if you have wickets left in your hand, you will actually benefit from the conditions," he said

 About a year ago, thousands of young people in Delhi did something they had not done before
 yuvaaon ne dinar par apane parivaar ke saath raajnneeti par charchaa kii
 Debating politics is not new to the people of Delhi, but this time it was something different
 is baar dilli ke logon ne ek nai raajnneetik party ko mauka dene kii sochi or unhone kai baar apni gadhi kamai se party ko chanda bhi diya
 a few months later, such people had to face embarrassment when their friends and close people told them - Dekha hai, we said it
 
 
 dilli ke kai logon kaa maananaa he ki hamane apane kaam se unhen niraash kiya he
 In May this year, we apologized to the people of Delhi for this
 agar meri maafee maangane kii baat aapane nahin suni ho, to main aapse phir se maafee maangata he, jisase hamaari baat aap tak saaf shabdon main pahunch sake
 With clean, honest governance and transparent funding, the Aam Aadmi Party was like a fresh breeze
 hamane kabhi jhooth nahin bolaa or kuch chipaaya nahin
 But i also believe that some people have been hurt by our work, because the image of the Aam Aadmi Party is the biggest of us
 logon ko is baat se thes pahunchi ki jis party or andolan ke liye unhone itnaa kuch kiya wo maidan chhodkar bhaagti dikhi
 People also believe that i had resigned from the post of Chief Minister of Delhi to become the Prime Minister after contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin ye galat he
 Shortly after resigning from the post of Chief Minister, i demanded a re-election in Delhi
 alpamat kii sarkaar hone ke baavjood hamaare sarkaar ke kaam karne kii lokapriyata 71 fisadi thi
 But Delhi's election was getting delayed
 baad main hamen ehsaas hua ki ham kuch zyaada hi bharosa kar rahe the
 This was a mistake, which we believe
 lekin ab hamen beeti baton ko bhuulakar bhavishya par dhyaan dena he
 After all, if people have given us the mandate to rule, they will expect us to work patiently
 haal hi main kisi ne kaha tha- dilli kii ek raajnneetik party ke rup main ham dilli ke logon ke liye kya kar sakate hai, wo zyaada jaruri he
 We believe this and take it seriously
 aam aadmi party ke myne alag-alag logon ke liye alag-alag hai
 For some people, it is such a power, which does not gather capital in a few hands, will fight against it and help people to do business
 kuch logon ke liye aam aadmi party sampradayik or dharmanirpeksh vichaardhaara se alag kuch nai cheez he
 For most people, the Aam Aadmi Party is an opportunity to live with the rights and freedoms from the Constitution
 pichley chunaav main hamane vaada kiya tha ki ham ye sunishchit karenge ki vyavsaay karne ke liye ghoose or police waalon ko haftaa na dena pade or keemtee rashtriya sansadhano ke khullam khulla chori se desh ko bachaane kaa kaam karenge
 We all want a stable and accountable government
 aisa maahaul chaahate hai jahaan rishwatakhori na ho, eemaandaaree se log apana kaam kar saken, har bachche ko ek behatar zindagi mili or ye aashwaasan mili ki vah surakshit he
 Whether we are Aam Aadmi Party or not, Kejriwal or not, we want a similar atmosphere
 kisi bhi samay logon kii ek sarkaar se itani hi chahat hoti he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has faced many challenges by becoming a team and family
 is parivaar main kisi bhi tarah kaa saamaajik yaa aarthik bandhan nahin he
 We are the people of Delhi and we know how to solve the problems of Delhi
 ham samajhate hai ki dilli ke log ye mahasoos karnaa chaahate hai ki unki sarkaar unke liye kaam kar rahi he
 We understand that the people of Delhi want us to work constructively with the Central Government
 ham samajhate hai ki dilli sarkaar eemaandaar hone ke saath hi sthir bhi honi chahie, aisi sarkaar jo pehle din se hi dilli ko duniya ke duusare bade shaharon kii barabari kaa banane ko taiyaar ho, aisi sarkaar jo har varg ke logon kii sune or unki jaruraton ke mutabik kaam kare

 england ke khilaaf investeke test shrunkhlaa main lagaataar do karaari haar jhelane ke baad ab bhartiya team ke paas siries ke ekmaatr match ko jeet siries baraabar karaane kaa ekmaatr vikalp bachaa he
 It is easy to say that after suffering an innings defeat for the third day in the fourth Test on Saturday at the Old Trafford Stadium in Manchester, it is really difficult to implement
 bhartiya team ke coach dancan flechar ko lekin apni team ke manobal ko dobaaraa ooncha uthaanaa hoga, taaki ve aakhri muqabla jitkar sammaan ke saath siries kaa samaapan kar saken
 Despite falling behind 2–1 in the five-match series, India has not lost everything
 bhartiya team yadi apni ballebaaji ke str ko upar le ja sake to thak chuke james anderson or chotil stfort broad ke saamne jeet hasil karnaa asambhav bhi nahin he
 India will have to leave behind the memories of England's last two series and remember the performance in the second Test match of the current series in which they won
 flechar ko sabase pehle team ke ballebaajon par dhyaan dena hoga
 Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane have at least shown positive attitude
 of stump se baahar jaati hui gendon ko unhen chhodana siikhnaa padegaa
 Virat can say for Kohli that he is in poor form, but his performances in Australia, South Africa and New Zealand place him in the category of a skilled batsman
 dhyaan rahe ki kharaab form kuch samay kii baat hoti he
 He has been dropped from the team for Shikhar Dhawan's irresponsible batting and Gautam Gambhir has been named in the team after a long time
 gambhir ne bina abhyaas ke team main vaapasi kii, jiskaa asar unki ballebaaji par bhi dikhaa
 But Gambhir has the ability to return, as he has done on the New Zealand tour
 siries kaa aglaa or aakhri test match landan ke da ovel stadium main hona he
 The Oval, England's oldest Test ground, is considered very suitable for batting in August
 sirf pehle din subah tej gendbaajon ko tathaa aakhri din spin gendbaajon ko is pich se kuch madad milti he
 In the fourth Test, India can get the benefit of the pitch if they come with an extra fast bowler
 nishchit taur par ishanth sharma ke swasth rahane par koi or vikalp nahin sochaa ja saktaa
 Stuart Binny could be included in the team in place of Pankaj Singh to add more depth to the batting
 mohammad sami tej gendbaaj ke rup main binni se behatar sabit ho sakate hai, lekin na to unki gendbaaji main maujuuda siries main vah dhar dikhaai di he or na hi unase har baar trent brij test main kii gai ballebaaji kii hi ummid kii ja sakati he
 In the Oval Test, it can be suggested to field the following Indian team: mahendra singh dhoni (captain / wicketiper), murali vijay, gautam gambhir, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli, ajinkya rahane, stfort binni yaa mohammad sami, ravichandran aswin, bhubaneshwar kumaar, varun aron or ishanth sharma
 This will be the first time in Indian parliamentary history when the Union Cabinet does not have a single Cabinet Minister from the states of East and Northeast, moving from Delhi to East, there is not a single Cabinet Minister in UP after Gonda (beni Prasad Verma)
 is ilaake se loksabhaa main 182 saansad aate hai
 Possibly the last reshuffle of UPA-2 was considered to be extremely important for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, but ahead of Gonda in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur , Congress has either ignored Mizoram, West Bengal and Tripura as politically infeasible or the Congress has failed to maintain social equations
 haalanki congress netaa purab kii andekhi ke aaropon ko behad sahaj tareeke se lete hai
 Sandeep Dixit, a Congress spokesperson and key lieutenant of Rahul Gandhi's team, tells India Today, "it may be a coincidence, deliberately, not done
" ” manmohan sarkaar or congress ke bachaav main unki daleel he, ''sarkaar main purab se shrikant jena, pawan ghatowar jaise mantri hai jo swatantra prabhaar vaale hai
 Many ministers have also been appointed from the Northeast
 cabinet main saamaajik-rajnatik-kshetreey santulan kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he, isliye ise cabinet yaa rajyamantri main baantkar nahin, balki mantrimandal main die gaye puure pratinidhitiv ke rup main dekhnaa chahie
 "but to the question of not appointing a Cabinet minister from the east," says Dixit, "seniority and many other aspects have to be taken care of while being made ministers
 ”lekin mukhya vipakshi dal bijepi ko congress kii daleel hajam nahin ho rahi
 Dharmendra Pradhan, a resident of Odisha and BJP national general secretary, alleges, "the cabinet reshuffle has made it clear that the Congress has only taken into consideration the party's losses and losses in states like Andhra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Karnataka and Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and entire northeastern states are ignored
 ”ve kehete hai, ''congress ne desh ke garib or pichde praant kii jaan-bujhkar upeksha kii he
 "pradhan even goes on to allege that the former, Northeast as well as Central India have been grossly ignored in the Manmohan cabinet
 unke mutabik vaajapeyi sarkaar ke samay jahaan madhya pradesh se chaar-chaar mantri hua karte the, ab congress raaj main sirf kamalnath hai
 However, apart from the arguments of the Congress, it is also a fact that Srikanth Jena of Odisha, who was a cabinet minister during the United Front government, is forced to remain a minister of independent charge in the UPA government
 pehali baar rajyamantri banaae jane par unhone apni naaraazgi kaa izhaar bhi kiya tha
 Pawan Ghatovar of Assam was also made the Minister of Independent Charge in 2011 and in this change he was expected to get promotion
 purvi bharat kaa pratinidhitiv manmohan sarkaar kii duusari pari main vaise bhi behad kam tha
 Pranab Mukherjee and Mamta Banerjee were part of the government as cabinet ministers from Bengal
 lekin mukherjee ab raashtrapati ban chuke hai, to mamata sarkaar se alag ho chuki hai
 The important reason for ignoring the east may also be that in other states except Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Bengal, the Congress has been out of the main political contest
 bihar or orissa main to congress kii jaden ukhd chuki hai
 It is obvious that the neglect of East and Northeast India can prove harmful for the Congress

 Whats up has produced more people outside Kashmir than any professor on Kashmir
 whats ap ke zariye kashmir ke zariye jis tarah ke tathyon ko gadha ja rahaa he usase halaat bighad hi rahe hai
 The same situation is there in the rest of India
 whats ap uniwarsity ke kaaran har doosraa aadmi kashmir par raay rakhata he
 i do not know Kashmir
 mujhe yah chemistry se bhi taff lagata he
 But the rest do not say that because everyone has read the message written on trucks - if you ask for milk, you will give kheer, if you ask for Kashmir, you will rip it
 kheer denge or cheer denge siddhant se kashmir samasya kaa kitna samaadhaan hua, ye to tivi channelon ke permanent export hi bataa sakate hai
 When the truck fails in between, people remember the Vajpayee formula
 insaaniyat, jamhuriyat or kashmiriat - yah kashmir kii samasya kii ayurvedic dawa he
 It is remembered when the allopathic fails
 pradhanmantri modi bhi vaajapeyi kii is dawa kaa zikr karte rahe hai
 Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti suddenly began to say loudly that there was a conversation even during Vajpayeeji's time, LK Advani was the deputy PM and then spoke with Hurriyat
 hamen jahaan par vaajapeyi ji chhod gaye the, vahiin se isko aage le janaa padegaa, varanaa jammu-kashmir ke halaat sudharne kaa koi chance nahin he
 What does it mean to have no chance? kya mahabuuba hurriyat yaa algaavvaadiyon se baat karne ke liye kah rahi hai? insaaniyat, jamhuriyat or kashmiriat kii zimmedaari unki sarkaar par bhi to he, kya unki sarkaar is dawa kaa vitaran nahin kar paa rahi he
 New facts are being created, why their government is not able to compete with them
 bharat ke duusare hisse main bhi whats ap ke zariye nae-nae tathy gadhe ja rahe hai
 Mehbooba Mufti does not have to go to London to find a solution
 mahabuuba mufti ne baatcheet kii baat kar hi di he to kisase baat ho wo bhi kar deni chahie thi
 The Hurriyat, which was presented as an agent of Pakistan in TV channels and political reactions, made your blood boil every night, what would happen if Mehbooba would have said that the Hurriyat or the separatists should have spoken then what would be the reaction of the allied BJP
 kya bijepi maan jaaegi
 When it comes to gunfire, TV experts explain who to fire a gun directly
 baatcheet ho, baatcheet ho karne vaale yahi nahin bataate ki kisase baatcheet ho
 Mehbooba said how long you will do this with your people
 unhen yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki apane logon ke saath abhi aisa kya ho rahaa he
 It is important to include in any conversation about Kashmir what is happening in the country about Kashmir
 darasal wo raay kashmir kii raay se zyaada mahatvapurn ho gai he
 Experts and anchors have worked hard to create this situation
 unke liye pathar chalaane vaala aatankwaadi he or sena kaa apradhi he, uske saath usee bhashaa main karrwai honi chahie
 But after listening carefully to the statement of Mehbooba Mufti, it seemed that there are two types of stones
 patharbazi ke liye 2-3 vajahen hai
 One is the boys who are angry, the other are those who are deliberately provoked
 is par discshan hoga to koi naa koi rasta zarur nikal aayega
 Is this a formula for our 'stone' and 'foreign' stone
 mahabuuba kaa yah bayaan sena ke liye he yaa sarkaar ke liye
 Whose policy is confrontation rather than compromise, is Mehbooba Mufti criticizing the policies of her ally BJP
 kashmir main jo kuch ho rahaa he uskaa khamiyaaza shesh bharat main padhane nikle kashmiri chaatro ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he

 At the NITI Aayog meeting on Sunday, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti told all the Chief Ministers that Kashmiri students are also children of their own

 ye bachche kashmir main aapke rajyon ke doot banakar jate hai
 You talk to them
 unka haalchaal lijie
 You can also call them occasionally and talk
 koi chance nahin he kaa kya matlab he
 Is Mehbooba asking to talk to Hurriyat or separatists? The responsibility of humanity, Jamuriyat and Kashmiriyat is also on his government, is his government not able to distribute this medicine
 nae-nae tathy gadhe ja rahe hai, unka muqabla unki sarkaar kyon nahin kar paa rahi he
 In other parts of India, new facts are being created through Whats Up
 mahabuuba mufti ko iskaa upaay khojane ke liye landan jane kii zarurat nahin he
 Mehbooba Mufti has already talked about the conversation, so whom should she talk to? jis hurriyat ko lekar tivi channelon or raajnneetik pratikriyaaon main pakistan kaa agent banaakar pesh kiya gaya, har raat aapke koon main ubaal paidaa kiya, kya hota agar mahabuuba kah detii ki hurriyat yaa algaavvaadiyon se baat honi chahie tab sahyogi bijepi kii kya pratikriya hoti
 Will the BJP agree? bandook chalaane kii baat hoti he to tivi ke export samajha dete hai ki kis par sidhe bandook chalaani he
 Whether it is a conversation, those who are talking do not know who to talk to
 mahabuuba ne kaha ki kab tak aap apane logon ke saath aisa karenge
 He should also have told what is happening to his people right now
 kashmir ko lekar kisi bhi baatcheet main is baat ko shaamil karnaa zaruri he ki desh main kashmir ko lekar kya ho rahaa he
 Actually, that opinion has become more important than the opinion of Kashmir
 is sthiti ko banane main export or ankaron ne bahut mehnat kii he
 For him, he is a stoning terrorist and an army criminal, action should be taken in the same language
 lekin mahabuuba mufti ke bayaan ko dhyaan se suna to laga ki do tarah ke patharbaz hai
 There are 2-3 reasons for stonewalling
 ek to jo ladke hai jo khafa hai, duusare wo jinako jaanboojh kar uksaaya jaataa he
 If there is discussion on this, then there will be some way out
 kya ye 'hamaare' patharbaz or 'paraaye' patharbaz vaala koi formula he
 Mehbooba's statement is for the army or for the government
 samjhaute kii jagah takaraav kii niti kiski he, kya mahabuuba mufti apane sahyogi bijepi kii nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahi hai
 Kashmiri students studying in the rest of India have to bear the brunt of what is happening in Kashmir
 tippaniyan Hashim Sophie, a student of Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani, was even called a terrorist by his classmates
 sofi santhaan chhodane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Eight Kashmiri students of Mewar University in Rajasthan also faced this
 unhen bhi aatankwaadi kaha gaya
 The stoner said
 meerut main ek poster laga diya gaya jisamen likhaa tha bhartiya sena par pathar maarane vaale kashmiriyon kaa bahishkaar, kashmiriyon upi chodo varanaa
 
 
 
 
 Police has sent Amit Jani, the national president of the National Navnirman Sena, to jail
 amit jaani ne hi 20 april ko poster lagaae the
 Meerut District Magistrate and SSP have met Kashmiri students and have also promised security
 isse pehle grih mantri rajnath singh ne sabhi mukhyamantriyon se kaha tha ki ve kashmiri chaatro ko tang kiye jane kii ghatana ko roke
 The Prime Minister has also appealed to the Chief Ministers
 ravivaar ko niti ayog kii baithak main mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne sabhi mukhyamantriyon se kaha ki kashmiri chaatr bhi aapke apane hi bachche hai
 These children go to Kashmir as ambassadors of your states
 aap unase baat kiijie
 Take care of them
 aap kabhi kabhi unhen bulaakar baat bhi kar sakate hai

 madhya pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ne apane ko uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri pad ke liye bhaajapa ummidavaar bataaye jane ko majaak bataate hue kaha ki abhi tak unhone bhaajapa main waapas aane ke bare main hi koi nirnay nahin liya he
 Uma said, 'don't know how this discussion has been going on that i am going to be presented as a contender for the post of Chief Minister from the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 yah varsh 2010 kaa sabase bada majaak he
 People should be careful with this
 isliye bhi ki abhi tak maine bhaajapa main waapas aane ke bare main koi nirnay hi nahi liya he
 He made it clear that whenever he had a conversation with BJP leaders
 (uma) 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main ummidavaar banane kii baat kahi thi na ki uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main, jo 2012 main hone vaale hai
 Uma said that she was deeply saddened by the death of her mother-in-law in the last few days and had retired from politics for some time
 uma ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani or adhyaksh nitin gadakari se unki baatcheet hui thi or donon ne unhen bhaajapa main party ke padaadhikari ke rup main waapas laaye jane kii ichha jataayi thi
 But on his proposal, i said that i want to join the NDA as a constituent with my party (bharatiya Janashakti Party)
 maine abhi bhaajapa main pun: shaamil hone ke bare main koi nirnay nahi liya
 Demanding all political parties to clarify their stand on corruption and criminalization of politics, Uma Bharti said that at present she wants to stay away from active politics for a few more days
 varisht bhaajapa netaa kii taraf se bhaajapa main unki vaapasi ke bare main aaye bayaan par uma ne kaha, ‘adwani ji mere pita tulya hai jo kah rahe hai, sahi kah rahe hai, magar main jo kah rahi hum vah bhi sahi he
 'uma was about to go to Ayodhya to see Ram Lalla, but she returned to Madhya Pradesh early this morning after the death of one of her close friends
 vahiin, uma bharti ne congress par ‘gaiyr jimmedaar’ raajnneetik party hone kaa aarope lagaate hue rahul gandhi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Uma Bharti alleged, 'congress is an irresponsible party
 pehle yah aatankwaad kaa aayojan karti he or phir usee ke naam par vot maangati he
 He said in response to a question, 'rahul takes a note (written statement) from Digvijay Singh, Rahul should read it first
 hamase class len
 He is a responsible person of a good family
 unhen gaiyr-jimmedaarana bayaan se bachanaa chahie
 He alleged that former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh taught Rahul Gandhi to make a statement against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 singh ko gaiyr-jimmedaarana bayaan dene kaa aadi bataate hue uma ne kaha ki rahul ko chahie ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii tulana simi ke saath karne se pehle sangh ke itihaas ke bare main pard len
 He criticized Rahul's alleged remarks about Hindu organizations, saying, 'jawaharlal Nehru took the support of the Sangh on the Kashmir issue and even participated in the Republic Day parade by the volunteers of the Sangh
 yah aitihaasik tathy he jisaki jaankaree rahul gandhi ko honi chahie
 ' apana doosraa vanade match khel rahe bilal asif ke of spinner ke rup main paanch wicket or baad main salaami ballebaaj ke taur par 38 ran kii umdaa pari se pakistan ne zimbabwe se teesraa or nirnaayak vanade match 96 gend shesh rahete hue saat wicket se jeet liya
 Thus he won the three-match series 2–1
 asif ko test captain misabah ul haq kii pahal par vanade team main shaamil kiya gaya, kyonki unka maananaa he ki england ke baayen haath ke ballebaajon ke khilaaf yah of spinner ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 Asif lived up to his belief and took five wickets for 25 runs, leaving Zimbabwe with only 38
 5 over main 161 ran par dher ho gaya
 Asif later went on to open the innings and scored 38 off 39 balls with the help of six fours and a six as well as a 58-run partnership for the first wicket with Ahmed Shehzad (32)
 in donon ke out hone ke baad asad shafic (naabad 38) or behtareen form main chal rahe shoeb malik (naabad 34) ne chauthe wicket ke liye 58 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii, jisase pakistan 34 over main teen wicket khokar lakshya hasil karne main safal rahaa
 The comments isse pehle zimbabwe ne toss ganvaane ke baad shandaar shuruyaat kii
 Openers Chamu Chibhabha (48) and Richmond Mutumbami (67) added 89 runs for the first wicket
 asif ne apane paanchaven over main chibhabha ko apni hi gend par kaich out karke yah saajhedaari todi
 This was 30-year-old Asif's second match for Pakistan
 unhone zimbabwe ke khilaaf duusare vanade main padaarpan kiya tha
 He was well supported by fellow spinner Imad Wasim, who took three wickets for 36 runs
 pakistan ne isse pehle tii020 siries main clin sweep kiya tha
 He could have won all the three matches of the ODI series as well, but the second ODI could not be completed due to poor light and Zimbabwe equalized the series by winning by five runs by Duckworth Lewis method

 Voting has begun in Britain over whether Britain should stay in the European Union or leave
 4 karod 65 lakh se adhik matadaata is janamat sangrah main bhaag le rahe hai
 Somewhere the voting is loud, somewhere slow
 24 june ko is janamat sangrah ke nattejey aane vaale hai
 Millions of citizens of the European Union's 27 member countries are eyeing the ongoing voting in Britain as to what Great Britain, the 28th member of the union, decides
 2014 ke saal main bhi ek aisa hi janamat sangrah hua tha, jab yah sawaal tha ki scotland ko britain se alag kar diya janaa chahie yaa nahin
 His decision was in favor of staying in Britain, but what will be the decision about the European Union
 britain ke itihaas kaa yah teesraa rashtravyapee janamat sangrah he
 For four months, there have been various types of social religious organizations campaigning from political parties
 koi europiin sangh se nikalne kaa pakshdhar he to koi bane rahane kaa pakshdhar
 These are being called live campaign and remain campaign in English
 guuruuvaar subah tak matdaan hoga or uske baad nattejey aaenge
 Whoever gets more than fifty percent of the vote will decide
 nateeja kya hoga ise lekar vahaan kaa media bhi bhartiya media kii tarah kasaratbaaz ho gaya he
 Like the whole campaign, the questions are being surveyed and shown only by including yes or no
 jaise bharat main chunaav hote hai ham media vaale ab anya muddon ko chhod koun banegaa pradhanmantri yaa koun banegaa mukhyamantri karne lagate hai
 In this, the election is passed, in the middle two to four sting operations and the news of the Dal Balu leaders are covered in the electoral market
 british media ke bhi kai rup dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 i am saying this so that you, as an audience and shareholder of democracy, understand how the media is changing your democratic character
 wo kaise apane tamaam survey ke zariye aapako haa yaa naa ke khaanche main samet rahaa he
 In democracy, you are not deciding, the media is deciding you
 aapako garh rahaa he
 The media is turning you into an artificial citizen as soon as the election comes
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aapako in baton se fark bhi padataa he yaa nahin
 So there is a flood of Hazard Opinion Polls in Britain
 kisi main european union se baahar hone kii jeet he to kisi main bane rahane waalon kii jeet he
 There is very little difference of opinion between the two
 vahaan kaa bhi dakshinpanthi media betuke rashtravaadi sawaalon ko uthaa rahaa he to udaaravaadi media muddon kii vividhta ko saamne nahin laa paa rahaa he
 Britain is undergoing restlessness
 yah bechaini itani kyon bad gai ki use european sangh se alag hone ke liye janamat sangrah kii taraf badhanaa padaa
 If Britain remains in the European Union, the question of whether to leave will end
 sawaal kya he
 Before this, one thing is to know that there is a slowdown in the world
 britain main bhi mandi chal rahi he
 This recession brings unemployment and slows down the pace of life
 nateeja ham sabake tark to hote hai magar tark karne ke tareeke itane ghaatak tareeke se badal jate hai ki kai baar loktantr hi khatare main padane lagata he
 In America, you must have seen what kind of aggressive things Donald Trump is doing on the pretext of these restless people
 ve kabhi kehane lagate hai ki musalamaanon ko america main ghusane nahin denge to kabhi kehete hai ki america naukariyon par bahari logon kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 People also do not see that leaders like Trump are saying the same thing to Muslims and non-muslims
 neuyark times main khabar he ki hillari clinton ne mana he ki america arthvyavastha avyavashtha kaa shikaar ho gai he
 Only they can change people's frustration with their policies
 hillari kahati hai ki washington kii naukarshahi or karporate ko badalanaa aasaan nahin magar prayaas karengi
 Is there really a leader in today's world who transforms the corporate
 karporate hi to netaa paidaa kar rahe hai to unhen koun paidaa karegaa
 Earth becomes a villain in times of crisis
 ise saadhane ke liye majboot netaa kaa aahwan hone lagata he
 Many strong leaders came and went in the world but could not bring economic stability for a long time from the current economy
 aarthik oochaal ab bahut dinon tak nahin tikta
 Does not last in one country
 kya obama kamazor netaa hai
 The economy is not run by the fitness of leaders
 hillari clinton ne yah nahin kaha ki ve chaatro ke karj maaf karengi lekin yah sunishchit karengi ki chaatr jab kalege se paas karen to un par karj kaa boj na rahe
 Can it happen aap ganit main fail bhi hai to dimag lagaaiye
 If education becomes fully marketable, how will you and us be saved from the cost of expensive fees? jab america kaa amir samaaj nahin batch sakaa to bharat kaa garib samaaj kaise batch jayega
 With Ramdev's medicine or Hamdard's Unani medicines
 hillari clinton kah rahi he ki jumalebaazi yaa chamakdaar naaron se kahin zyada yojana banane kii jarurat he
 It requires experience
 dhyaan se dekhenge to unki ye baaten bhi jumale se kam nahin he
 Hillary Clinton has also said that she will use tax rules to monitor companies that send their work to outside countries
 jisase vahaan ke logon ko naukariyaan milti hai america ko nahin
 Every other big country in the global world is struggling with the question of jobs
 jo baat america main ho rahi he vahi baat britain main ho rahi he
 Britain's sluggish economy and unemployment is also a big reason for leaving the European Union
 britain ke nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke deshon ke naagarik unki naukariyaan kha ja rahe hai, britain main rahane vaale bharat, pakistan or bangladesh se gaye nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke kaaran unke logon ko naukariyaan nahin mil rahi hai
 One is not understanding the problem of economics, one is searching for medicines in the bureaucracy and one is searching for medicines to get out of the European Union
 16 may 2016 ko independent akhbaar ne ek lekh chapa tha
 Poverty in the UK increased between 2013 and 2016
 15
 6 percent to 16
 8 pratishat ho gai he
 Poverty is much higher in Britain than in European Union countries
 britain main uniwarsity se paas hone vaale chaatro par european union ke deshon ke chaatro kii tulana main bahut zyaada karz kaa boj he
 The average loan for each student in 2015 is 44,500 euros
 bhartiya rupee main iskaa anuwaad karenge to behosh hi ho jaaenge
 a student has a debt of forty-four lakh rupees when he passes the university
 newzealand, austrailia,america ke chaatro se bhi zyada karja britain ke chaatro kaa he
 This is the result of privatization of education
 sarkarein janata ke paise se hathiyaar kharidne bechney ke dhandhe main lagi hai or uskaa yuva karj kaa boj liye nikal rahaa he
 Inequality is increasing in Britain
 asantosh bad rahaa he
 Therefore, it would not be appropriate to look at this referendum with a view or a spectacle
 hamen yah dekhnaa hoga ki mazdoor varg kya soch rahaa he
 Why is the youth thinking so? mahilaayein kyon european sangh se nikalne kii baat kah rahi hai
 Britain may remain in the European Union with the difference of a few votes, but are the questions being raised that this referendum is giving an answer
 sankat he lekin is sankat ke bahaane kuch netaa aisi baaten kah rahe hai jinka samaadhaan se koi sambandh nahin
 Only the decision to leave the EU can soothe frustration or immediate anger, but no one has a blueprint of what the solution will be
 britain main amir hi amir hota he jaisaa bharat main hota he jaisaa america main ho rahaa he
 a report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies has been published in the Independent newspaper, according to which a rich student is earning more money even if a student of a rich and simple background, from the same university, gets a degree from the same course
 saadhaaran chaatro ke mukaable
 The condition is that girls perform better from school to college, they are also earning less than boys
 ham janamat sangrah jaise vakt main in kaarnon kii padtaal kyon nahin karte hai
 On the other hand, under the pretext of this issue, in this global period, we can understand the idea of nationalism afresh
 european union chaahe jitna kargar ho yah ek karporate rashtrawaad he
 Which is not accountable to the people of member countries
 sadsy desh apane nirvaachit sadasyon main se kuch ko iyu main bhejte hai
 The union has a president and a cabinet
 ek kism kii global sarkaar to he hi kyonki uske banaae sainkadon niyam sadsy deshon par lagu hote hai
 The comments european union bhale hi vyapaar karne kii vyaavhaarik dikkaton kaa samaadhaan karata ho lekin kya yah loktantric aakankshaon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In view of these questions, can the reasons behind the referendum be analyzed
 kya iske kaaran saanskrithik or saamudayik pahchaan ke sankat kuch alag tarah se ubhar rahe hai
 The separatist movements within Europe are viewing this referendum differently
 jaise kaatalonia spain se alag hona chahta he
 The separatists there want Britain to decide to leave the Union
 spain dhamkee de rahaa he ki agar britain niklaa to uske nagarikon par nakaaratmak asar padegaa jo european union ke alag alag deshon main kaam kar rahe hai
 This referendum is an interesting practice
 bharat jaise mulk main do chaar sanghathanon ke dharna pradarshan se rashtrawaad or samprabhutaa ke sawaal tay kiye ja rahe hai
 Millions of people in Britain are facing this question through voting
 bharat ke log jo landan jane kaa khwab dekhte hai, basane or naukari karne kaa bhi, pehle se kai lakh log bas bhi chuke hai
 What matters is the referendum for them
 yah janamat sangrah european sangh ko kya badal degaa yaa britain ne badal diya he, is par ham prime time main baat karenge
 This is the third nationwide referendum in the history of Britain
 chaar maheene se vahaan raajnneetik dalon se lekar tarah tarah ke saamaajik dharmik sanghathan abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 Some are in favor of leaving the European Union and some are in favor of remaining
 inhen angrezi main live campan or remean campan kaha ja rahaa he
 Voting will be done by Thursday morning and results will be thereafter
 jise bhi pachaas fisadi se adhik vot milegaa vahi faisla hoga
 The media there has become a workout like the Indian media about what will be the result
 puure abhiyaan ke tarah tarah ke sawaalon ko sirf haa yaa naan main samet kar survey kiye ja rahe hai or dikhaaye ja rahe hai
 As elections are held in India, we the media now leave other issues, who will become the Prime Minister or who will become the Chief Minister? isi main chunaav biit jaataa he bich bich main do chaar sting aaparishan or dal badalu netaaon kii khabaren chunavi market main chaa jaati hai
 There are many forms of British media too
 yah main isliye bataa rahaa hum taaki aap ek darshak or loktantr ke hissedaar ke rup main samaj saken ki media aapke loktantric charitra ko kaise badal rahaa he
 How is he covering you in the grooves of yes or no through his survey? loktantr main aap tay nahin kar rahe hai, media aapako tay kar rahaa he
 Is building you chunaav aate hi media aapako ek kritrim naagarik main badal rahaa he
 i do not know if you make a difference with these things or not
 to hazaraat opinian pole kii baadh ai hui he britain main
 In some, victory is out of the European Union, and in others there is victory
 donon ke bich maton kaa faasla bahut kam he
 Even the right-wing media is raising absurd nationalist questions, while the liberal media is not able to bring out the diversity of issues
 britain bechaini se guzar rahaa he
 Why this uneasiness grew so much that he had to move towards the referendum to break away from the European Union
 agar britain european sangh main bana rahata he to kya chhodane ke pakshadharon ke sawaal samaapt ho jaaenge
 what's the question
 isse pehle ek baat yah jaan lijie ki duniya main mandi chal rahi he
 The recession is also going on in Britain
 ye mandi berojgaare laati he or jivan kii gati ko dhimaa kar detii he
 The result is the logic of all of us, but the ways of reasoning change in such a fatal way that at times democracy itself is in danger
 america main aapane dekha hoga donald trump in bechainiyon ke bahaane kis tarah kii aakraamak baaten kar rahe hai
 They sometimes start saying that Muslims will not allow them to enter America, and sometimes they say that outsiders will not have rights over American jobs
 log yah bhi nahin dekh pate ki trump jaise netaa musalamaanon or gaiyr musmalanon ke liye ek hi baat kah rahe hai
 The New York Times reports that Hillary Clinton admits the US economy has fallen into disarray
 sirf ve hi logon kii hataasha ko apni nitiyon se badal sakati hai
 Hillary says that changing Washington's bureaucracy and corporate will not be easy but will try
 kya vaaki aaj kii duniya main koi netaa he jo karporate ko badal de
 If corporates are producing leaders, then who will produce them? arth sankat ke samay naukarshahi khalanaayak ban jaati he
 It takes a strong leader's call to practice it
 duniya main bahut se majboot netaa aae or gaye magar maujuuda arthniti se lambey samay tak ke liye aarthik sthayitv nahin laa sake
 The economic boom does not last long
 ek desh main nahin tikta he
 Is Obama a weak leader? arthvyavastha netaaon ke fitness se nahin chalati he
 Hillary Clinton did not say that she would forgive the students' debts but would ensure that when the students pass from the college, they are not burdened with debt
 kya aisa ho saktaa he
 If you fail in mathematics also, mind yourself
 agar shiksha puri tarah bazaaru ho jaaegi to mahangi fees kii maar se aap or ham kaise bachenge
 When the rich society of America could not survive, then how would the poor society of India survive
 ramdev kii aushadhi se yaa hamdard kii unani dawaaiyon se
 Hillary Clinton is saying that there is more need to plan than jumlebabies or shiny slogans
 iske liye anubhav kii zarurat he
 If we look carefully, these things of him are also not less than a word
 hillari clinton ne yah bhi kaha he ki ve tex niyamon kaa istemaal kar un companiyon par nigaah rakhengi jo apana kaam baahar ke deshon main bhej dete hai
 Which gives jobs to the people there, not American
 global jagat main har doosraa bada desh naukariyon ke sawaal se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 The same thing that is happening in America is happening in Britain
 european sangh se nikalne ke peeche britain kii sust arthvyavastha or berojgaare bhi bada kaaran he
 British citizens feel that citizens of European Union countries are losing their jobs, citizens from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh living in Britain feel that their people are not getting jobs due to European Union
 koi arthniti ke khot ko nahin samaj rahaa koi naukarshahi main dawa khoj rahaa he to koi european union se nikalne main dawa khoj rahaa he
 An article was published by the Independent newspaper on 16 May 2016

 15
 6 pratishat se badhkar 16
 8 percent
 european union ke deshon kii tulana main britain main garibi bahut zyada he
 Students passing university in the UK have a higher debt burden than students in European Union countries
 2015 main har chaatr par ausat karza 44,500 euro he
 If you translate it into Indian rupees, then you will faint
 ek chaatr par chauwalis lakh rupee kaa karz hota he jab wo uniwarsity se paas karata he
 UK students have more loans than students in New Zealand, Australia, USA
 ye he shiksha ke nijeekaran kaa nateeja
 Governments are engaged in the business of buying and selling weapons with the money of the public and its youth are running out of debt
 britain main asamanta bad rahi he
 There is growing discontent
 isliye is janamat sangrah ko ek najariye yaa ek chashme se dekhnaa thik nahin rahegaa
 We have to see what the working class is thinking

 Why are women asking to leave the European Union? kuch voton ke antar se bhale britain european sangh main rah jaae magar jo sawaal uth rahe hai kya unka jawaab ye janamat sangrah de rahaa he
 There is a crisis, but on the pretext of this crisis, some leaders are saying such things which have no relation with the solution
 sirf iyu se nikal jane kaa faisla hataasha yaa tatkaal gusse ko shant kar saktaa he magar samaadhaan kya hoga iskaa koi blueprint kisi ke paas nahin he
 In Britain, the rich are as rich as they are in India, as in America
 indipentand akhbaar main institute aaf phiscal study kii ek report chhapi he jiske anusaar agar ek amir or ek saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke chaatr, ek hi vishvavidhyalay se, ek hi course se degree lekar nikalate hai tab bhi amir chaatr zyaada paise kama rahaa hota he
 Compared to ordinary students
 haalat yah he ki ladkiyaan skool se lekar kalege main behatar pradarshan karti hai wo bhi ladakon kii tulana main kam kama rahi hoti hai
 Why do we not investigate these reasons in times like referendum
 duusari taraf kya is masale ke bahaane ham is global daur main rashtrawaad kii dharna ko lekar nae sire se soch samaj sakate hai
 Regardless of how effective the European Union is, it is a corporate nationalism
 jo sadsy deshon kii janata ke prati javabdeh nahin he
 Member countries send some of their elected members to the EU
 union kaa ek president hota he or mantrimandal bhi
 There is a kind of global government because hundreds of rules made by it apply to member countries
 tippaniyan The European Union may solve practical difficulties of doing business, but does it represent democratic aspirations
 kya in sawaalon ke maddenjar janamat sangrah ke peeche chhipe kaarnon kaa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Are cultural and community identity crises emerging somewhat differently due to this
 europe ke bheetar algaavvaadi andolan is janamat sangrah ko alag tareeke se dekh rahe hai
 Like Catalonia wants to separate from Spain
 vahaan ke algaavvaadi chaahate hai ki britain sangh se nikalne kaa faisla kare
 Spain is threatening that if Britain comes out then it will have a negative impact on citizens who are working in different countries of the European Union
 ek dilachasp abhyaas to he hi ye janamat sangrah
 In a country like India, questions of nationalism and sovereignty are being decided by protest demonstrations by two or four organizations
 britain main karodon log matdaan ke zariye is sawaal kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 People of India who dream of going to London, to settle down and do jobs, have already settled many lakhs of people
 unke liye janamat sangrah kya myne rakhata he
 We will talk in prime time on whether this referendum will change the European Union or what Britain has changed

 We will talk in prime time on whether this referendum will change the European Union or what Britain has changed
 british media ke bhi kai rup dekhne ko mil rahe hai
 i am saying this so that you, as an audience and shareholder of democracy, understand how the media is changing your democratic character
 wo kaise apane tamaam survey ke zariye aapako haa yaa naa ke khaanche main samet rahaa he
 In democracy, you are not deciding, the media is deciding you
 aapako garh rahaa he
 The media is turning you into an artificial citizen as soon as the election comes
 mujhe nahin pataa ki aapako in baton se fark bhi padataa he yaa nahin
 So there is a flood of Hazard Opinion Polls in Britain
 kisi main european union se baahar hone kii jeet he to kisi main bane rahane waalon kii jeet he
 There is very little difference of opinion between the two
 vahaan kaa bhi dakshinpanthi media betuke rashtravaadi sawaalon ko uthaa rahaa he to udaaravaadi media muddon kii vividhta ko saamne nahin laa paa rahaa he
 Britain is undergoing restlessness
 yah bechaini itani kyon bad gai ki use european sangh se alag hone ke liye janamat sangrah kii taraf badhanaa padaa
 If Britain remains in the European Union, the question of whether to leave will end
 sawaal kya he
 Before this, one thing is to know that there is a slowdown in the world
 britain main bhi mandi chal rahi he
 This recession brings unemployment and slows down the pace of life
 nateeja ham sabake tark to hote hai magar tark karne ke tareeke itane ghaatak tareeke se badal jate hai ki kai baar loktantr hi khatare main padane lagata he
 In America, you must have seen what kind of aggressive things Donald Trump is doing on the pretext of these restless people
 ve kabhi kehane lagate hai ki musalamaanon ko america main ghusane nahin denge to kabhi kehete hai ki america naukariyon par bahari logon kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 People also do not see that leaders like Trump are saying the same thing to Muslims and non-muslims
 neuyark times main khabar he ki hillari clinton ne mana he ki america arthvyavastha avyavashtha kaa shikaar ho gai he
 Only they can change people's frustration with their policies
 hillari kahati hai ki washington kii naukarshahi or karporate ko badalanaa aasaan nahin magar prayaas karengi
 Is there really a leader in today's world who transforms the corporate
 karporate hi to netaa paidaa kar rahe hai to unhen koun paidaa karegaa
 Earth becomes a villain in times of crisis
 ise saadhane ke liye majboot netaa kaa aahwan hone lagata he
 Many strong leaders came and went in the world but could not bring economic stability for a long time from the current economy
 aarthik oochaal ab bahut dinon tak nahin tikta
 Does not last in one country
 kya obama kamazor netaa hai
 The economy is not run by the fitness of leaders
 hillari clinton ne yah nahin kaha ki ve chaatro ke karj maaf karengi lekin yah sunishchit karengi ki chaatr jab kalege se paas karen to un par karj kaa boj na rahe
 Can it happen aap ganit main fail bhi hai to dimag lagaaiye
 If education becomes fully marketable, how will you and us be saved from the cost of expensive fees? jab america kaa amir samaaj nahin batch sakaa to bharat kaa garib samaaj kaise batch jayega
 With Ramdev's medicine or Hamdard's Unani medicines
 hillari clinton kah rahi he ki jumalebaazi yaa chamakdaar naaron se kahin zyada yojana banane kii jarurat he
 It requires experience
 dhyaan se dekhenge to unki ye baaten bhi jumale se kam nahin he
 Hillary Clinton has also said that she will use tax rules to monitor companies that send their work to outside countries
 jisase vahaan ke logon ko naukariyaan milti hai america ko nahin
 Every other big country in the global world is struggling with the question of jobs
 jo baat america main ho rahi he vahi baat britain main ho rahi he
 Britain's sluggish economy and unemployment is also a big reason for leaving the European Union
 britain ke nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke deshon ke naagarik unki naukariyaan kha ja rahe hai, britain main rahane vaale bharat, pakistan or bangladesh se gaye nagarikon ko lagata he ki european sangh ke kaaran unke logon ko naukariyaan nahin mil rahi hai
 One is not understanding the problem of economics, one is searching for medicines in the bureaucracy and one is searching for medicines to get out of the European Union
 16 may 2016 ko independent akhbaar ne ek lekh chapa tha
 Poverty in the UK increased between 2013 and 2016
 15
 6 percent to 16
 8 pratishat ho gai he

 The economic boom does not last long

 Is Obama a weak leader? arthvyavastha netaaon ke fitness se nahin chalati he
 Hillary Clinton did not say that she would forgive the students' debts but would ensure that when the students pass from the college, they are not burdened with debt

 If you fail in mathematics also, mind yourself

 When the rich society of America could not survive, then how would the poor society of India survive
 ramdev kii aushadhi se yaa hamdard kii unani dawaaiyon se
 Hillary Clinton is saying that there is more need to plan than jumlebabies or shiny slogans

 If we look carefully, these things of him are also not less than a word

 european union ke deshon kii tulana main britain main garibi bahut zyada he
 Students passing university in the UK have a higher debt burden than students in European Union countries
 2015 main har chaatr par ausat karza 44,500 euro he
 If you translate it into Indian rupees, then you will faint
 ek chaatr par chauwalis lakh rupee kaa karz hota he jab wo uniwarsity se paas karata he
 UK students have more loans than students in New Zealand, Australia, USA
 ye he shiksha ke nijeekaran kaa nateeja
 Governments are engaged in the business of buying and selling weapons with the money of the public and its youth are running out of debt
 britain main asamanta bad rahi he
 There is growing discontent
 isliye is janamat sangrah ko ek najariye yaa ek chashme se dekhnaa thik nahin rahegaa
 We have to see what the working class is thinking

 Why are women asking to leave the European Union? kuch voton ke antar se bhale britain european sangh main rah jaae magar jo sawaal uth rahe hai kya unka jawaab ye janamat sangrah de rahaa he
 There is a crisis, but on the pretext of this crisis, some leaders are saying such things which have no relation with the solution

 In Britain, the rich are as rich as they are in India, as in America
 indipentand akhbaar main institute aaf phiscal study kii ek report chhapi he jiske anusaar agar ek amir or ek saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke chaatr, ek hi vishvavidhyalay se, ek hi course se degree lekar nikalate hai tab bhi amir chaatr zyaada paise kama rahaa hota he
 Compared to ordinary students

 Member countries send some of their elected members to the EU

 There is a kind of global government because hundreds of rules made by it apply to member countries
 tippaniyan The European Union may solve practical difficulties of doing business, but does it represent democratic aspirations

 europe ke bheetar algaavvaadi andolan is janamat sangrah ko alag tareeke se dekh rahe hai
 Like Catalonia wants to separate from Spain
 vahaan ke algaavvaadi chaahate hai ki britain sangh se nikalne kaa faisla kare
 Spain is threatening that if Britain comes out then it will have a negative impact on citizens who are working in different countries of the European Union
 ek dilachasp abhyaas to he hi ye janamat sangrah
 In a country like India, questions of nationalism and sovereignty are being decided by protest demonstrations by two or four organizations
 britain main karodon log matdaan ke zariye is sawaal kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 People of India who dream of going to London, to settle down and do jobs, have already settled many lakhs of people
 unke liye janamat sangrah kya myne rakhata he
 We will talk in prime time on whether this referendum will change the European Union or what Britain has changed
 britain bechaini se guzar rahaa he
 Why this uneasiness grew so much that he had to move towards the referendum to break away from the European Union
 agar britain european sangh main bana rahata he to kya chhodane ke pakshadharon ke sawaal samaapt ho jaaenge
 what's the question
 isse pehle ek baat yah jaan lijie ki duniya main mandi chal rahi he
 The recession is also going on in Britain
 ye mandi berojgaare laati he or jivan kii gati ko dhimaa kar detii he
 The result is the logic of all of us, but the ways of reasoning change in such a fatal way that at times democracy itself is in danger
 america main aapane dekha hoga donald trump in bechainiyon ke bahaane kis tarah kii aakraamak baaten kar rahe hai
