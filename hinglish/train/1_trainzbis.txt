kya aapke 15 varshon ke kaarykaal main yahi vikaas hua he?aapane apane patr main aarope lagaaya he ki aapaki sarkaar ke bhrashtachar kii baaten uthaakar hamane mahilaon kaa apmaan kiya he kyonki aap ek mahila hai
 But this argument is not correct
 agar koi mahila netaa galat kaam kare to kya uski ninda nahin honi chahie? aap mahila hai lekin yah bade dukh kii baat he ki aap mahilaon ke dard ko nahin samajhati
 Today most rapes are happening in Delhi
 dilli kii har mahila apane aapako asurakshit mahasoos karti he
 When the girl leaves from home for college in the morning, the parents heart-throb until she returns home in the evening
 dilli kii mahilaon ko suraksha dene ke liye aapaki sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya
 Whenever there is a rape in Delhi, you say that the Delhi Police is not under your control
 janata ne to aap ko vot diya tha
 The people of Delhi do not want a Chief Minister who is so helpless and helpless
 janata ko aisa mukhyamantri chahie jo unki suraksha kar sake
 Even more tragic is that people seeking justice against rape are brutally beaten up by the police and false cases are filed against them
 aap dilli main ho rahe balaatkaaron se pallaa kaise jhaad saktin hai? centre or dilli donon jagah congress kii sarkaar he, to dilli main ho rahe balaatkaar or balaatkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karne waalon par danda barasaane ke liye sidhe congress party jimmedaar he chaahe wo centre main baithi congress ho yaa phir dilli main baithi congress ho
 Delhi's development has not been destroyed in the last 15 years
 vikaas ke naam par keval bhrashtachar hua he
 Due to corruption, tax was imposed on the people, due to which, everything became expensive

 If you are ready for debate then this will be a solid beginning of 'clean politics' in the country

 unka kahana he ki unhen is baat kaa dukh he ki unhone patel ko vot nahin diya he
 The battle for Congress is at stake in the prestige of the Congress because the Congress, along with 65 mlas, had nominated Ahmed Patel, the political secretary and influential leader of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, for the Rajya Sabha seat but the resignation of 6 mlas and several leaders The Congress has lost its political arithmetic due to its being out of touch

 In Chhattisgarh, the medicinal tree Kullu is on the verge of extinction
 in pedo kii andhadhundh kataai ke kaaran chaandi jaise chamakdaar tane vaale kullu ke vilupt hone kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 Kullu, which was seen separately in the entire forest with its glow in the moonlight night, was named 'lady Leg' by the British due to its beauty
 tane ke aakarshak chamkilepan ke chalate angrej isaki tulana gori mem kii taangon se karte the
 Some of the Kullu trees on the banks of the drain in Achanakmar in the state are still left and if not tried to save them soon, then these rare medicinal trees may end
 chhattisgarh ke achaanakmaar tiger rigerv ke purv sanchaalak va varisht iesces adhikari anil kumaar sahu kaa kahana he ki kullu ke ped durlabh ho sakate hai, lekin vilupt nahin hue hai
 Tissue culture was used to increase the number of these trees, but the trees produced in this way do not have their natural properties
 bilaspur sthit guru ghasidas central uniwarsity main vanaspati shaastra vibhaag ke vibhaagadhyaksh sunil chaturvedi ke mutabik kullu kaa vanaspatik naam easter kulia uran he
 Due to the bright attractive color, these trees are recognized separately at night
 march main iske pattey jab gir jate hai, tab pile rang ke phool khilte hai
 Kullu causes strange panic at night after all the leaves have fallen
 lihaaja ise ghost tree (bhutiya ped) ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 He told that gum of Kullu has powerful and medicinal properties
 videshon main isaki keemat kaaphi hoti he
 However, there are still few numbers of these trees in the state and there is a need to save them and preserve them
 nahin to ye sirf kitabon or dantakthaon main hi rah jaaenge

 saal 2018 main desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne kai aitihaasik faisle sunaae
 Many of these decisions were not only against orthodox thinking, but also in the interest of modern society
 inamen kuch faislon kaa virodh bhi hua
 Former CJI Deepak Mishra made a number of historical decisions in the last days of his tenure
 sitambar maah main supreme court ne lagaataar kai aise faisle die jinka bada asar dikhegaa
 These include decisions ranging from LGBT to Adultry and Sabarimala
 in faislon se bhartiya samaaj main bada badlaav aayega
 These are five such important decisions of the Supreme Court this year - 1
 dhara 497 vyabhichaar (adultery) kanoonsupreme court ne 158 saal puraane vyabhichaar rodhi kanoon ko radd karte hue ise aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar kar diya he
 On September 27, a 5-judge bench in the Supreme Court gave a historic verdict scrapping the Section 497 Adultery Act of the IPC
 mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ne kaha ki yah kanoon beshak talaak kaa aadhaar ho saktaa he, lekin yah mahila ke jeene ke adhikaar par bhi asar daalata he
 The Court while interpreting Section 497 said that according to this the wife is considered to be the property of husband which is discriminatory
 jis praavdhaan se mahila ke saath garasmanta kaa bartaav ho, vah asanvaidhanik he
 2
 samalangikta aparaadh kii shrenee se baharsupreme court ne 6 sitambar ko aitihaasik faisla samalangikta par diya
 a bench of 5 judges gave a historic verdict in favor of the LGBT community, repealing Section 377
 court ne kaha ki do vayaskon ke bich paraspar sahmati se sthapit samalangik yon sambandh aparaadh kii shrenee main nahin aa sakate
 Sexual preference is biological and natural
 yah behad vyaktigat maamla he
 The LGBT community should also have equal rights
 isamen bhedbhaav moulik adhikaron kaa hanan he
 The court completely legalized it, excluding it from the category of crime
 ye aitihaasik faisla sunaane vaali peeth main chif justise deepak mishra, justise rohington nariman, justise chandrachud, justise khanvilkar or justise indu malhotra thim
 3
 aadhaar kii anivaaryta par aitihaasik faislaadhar card par is saal khub bavaal machaa
 Questions arose on the imperative of Aadhaar from banks to mobile companies
 data li kii kai baar ashankaayen jaahir kii gayi
 Justice Deepak Mishra delivered a series of sharp decisions in September
 inamen aadhaar kii anivaaryta par bhi faisla tha
 The court upheld the constitutionality of Aadhaar, but made it clear that it would not be mandatory to link Aadhaar everywhere
 is par 38 dinon tak lambii sunwaayee chali thi
 The court made it clear that mobile and private companies cannot demand Aadhaar
 court ne aanshik badlaav ke saath aadhaar adhinium kii dhara 57 ko hataa diya
 4
 mahilaon ke liye bhi sabarimala ke daravaaje khuleis saal supreme court ne dharmik masalon par bhi kai faisle die
 The most important of these was related to the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple in Kerala
 28 sitambar ko SC ne sabarimala mandir main mahilaon kii entry par lage bain ko hataa diya
 While delivering the judgment, the bench said that women too have equal right to worship
 ise rokna moulik adhikaar kaa hanan he
 Till now the entry of women from 10 years to 50 years was banned in the temple
 5
 Hearing on the ownership of land in Ayodhya: The Supreme Court has stepped up the hearing on the very sensitive Ram temple issue
 is saal chif justise kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ne ayodhya main ram janm bhoomi-babari masjid vivaad par sirf jameen ke malikana haq ke vaad ke rup main hi vichaar karne kii baat karte hue kaha ki is maamle kii jald se jald sunwaayee shuru ho
 On 26 December, the Supreme Court decided that the matter will be heard on 4 January 2019
 ram mandir par faisle kaa puure desh ko pichley kai dashak se intjaar he
 Reservation is not just for poor upper castes
 jaisaa ki media main chalaaya ja rahaa he
 It is being given to the economically weaker sections
 jisamen hindu savarna, musalmaan or isai shaamil hai
 Its draft reveals the same thing
 yahi baat saamaajik nyaay rajya mantri vijay saanpala ne bhi kahi he
 OBC and SC / ST are excluded from it
 isliye agar koi likhata he ki das pratishat garib savarnon ko aarakshan diya gaya he to yah galat he
 Muslims and Christians should also be written in it
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak pard len
 This is written kahin nahin likhaa he ki isai or musalmaan nahin he
 The first general was attended by Christians and Muslims, but the general was not considered a reservation
 ab jab das pratishat kaa aarakshan aarthik aadhaar par diya ja rahaa he tab usamen isai or musalmaan bhi rakhe gaye hai
 The BJP and the Sangh have been opposing the reservation of Muslims and Christians
 is sandarbh me is baat kaa vishesh rup se ullekh karnaa zaruri he
 Second, there were many demands for reservation in front of the Modi government
 amit shah ke kai bayaan milenge ki pachaas fisadi se zyaada aarakshan nahin ho saktaa he
 Now the same Amit Shah will be seen saying that reservation can be more than fifty percent
 haryana main jat ab aarakshan maangenge ki jab aap pachaas fisadi kii seemaa paar kar hi rahe hai to hamen aarakshan kyon nahin de rahe hai
 Patidars will also say the same in Gujarat
 vahaan jhansa dene ke liye rajya sarkaar ne aarthik rup se kamazor tabake ko das percent kaa aarakshan diya tha jise gujarat hai court ne janvari 2018 main asanvaidhanik qaraar dete hue nirast kar diya tha
 Will Patidar and Jat get reservation? obcs with an annual income of eight lakhs do not get the benefit of reservation
 general ke liye bhi yahi paimaana hoga
 Backward Muslims have reservation in Muslims, but if Dalit and Ashraf Muslims have less than 8 lakh annual income then they can come under its purview
 saath hi sarkari madad yaa uske bagair chalane vaale ucchtar shaikshanik sansthaaon main bhi aarthik rup se kamazor tabake ko aarakshan kaa laabh diya jayega jo ki samvidhan main bhi likhaa he
 There is no change for this
 sijeai ne kaha ki centre ke vakil kah rahe hen ki wo javaabi halafanama daakhil karnaa chaahate hai lekin ye nahin bataa rahe ki wo rafel main halafanama daakhil karnaa chaahate hai
 So if they want more time, they want to postpone the hearing
 unako kahana chahie ki kal (mangalvaar) do baje hone vaali rafel maamle kii sunwaayee main wo javaabi halafanama daakhil karnaa chaahate he
 Similarly, Singhvi is not taking the names of PM Modi and Amit Shah
 aapako ye sab band karnaa chahie
 Heide and seek will not play along the court
 Central Government seeks time to file a fresh affidavit in the Rafale review petition case and asks the court to defer the hearing which was fixed for tomorrow to allow it to file the affidavit

 com / kjpa7zvla4 Please tell, Congress Supreme Court against Election Commission (supreme Court) for not taking 'action' against PM Modi and Amit Shah for alleged violation of Code of Conduct
 Has arrived
 congress (congress) ne supreme court se kaha ki piem modi or amit shah ke khilaaf 24 ghante main faisla lene ke liye ayog ko nirdesh die jaaen
 The Congress said that by rallying in Gujarat on April 23, the Prime Minister violated the code of conduct
 congress ne chunaav ayog se piem or amit shah ke ulanghan kii shikaayat kii he lekin teen hafte bitne ke baad bhi chunaav ayog dwaara koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 Usually, in such cases, the Election Commission bans campaigners for 72 hours for violators

 Aamir Khan has changed his decision to pull out of the biopic of Gulshan Kumar
 is bare main hindustan times se baat karte hue, aamir ne nishchit rup se nirdeshak ke saath kaam karke ek nai misaal kaayam kii he or share kiya he ki unka nidar kadam is tathy se he ki ek vyakti doshi sabit hone tak nirdosh he or adaalat nyaay kaa saath degi
 In October last year, Aamir Khan tweeted that he will not be a part of 'mogul', but has now changed his decision
 mogul main vaapasi par liye gaye is achaanak badlaav par hindustan times se baat karte hue aamir khan (aamir Khan) ne share kiya, “khayr, kiran or main mogul kaa nirmaan kar rahe the or main isamen abhinay kar rahaa tha
 While we were doing the film, we did not know that a case was going on against the honorable Subhash Kapoor
 meraa maananaa he ki yah paanch yaa chah saal purana maamla he
 We are not very much in the media space, so i think it did not go unnoticed
 pichley saal, me-tu movement ke dauraan, yah maamla saamne aayaa tha or jab hamen iske bare main pataa chalaa, ham behad pareshaan ho gaye the
 Kiran and i talked about it in detail
 ham ek saptaah se adhik samay se badi duvidha main the
 Krishna Shroff, who is dating Tiger Shroff's friend, revealed himself in an interview while talking about the impact on the life of Subhash Kapoor, Aamir Khan said, "it was really bothering us because We felt that our action inadvertently put a person in trouble who is on the verge of losing his livelihood in this matter, and for how long? Is it for one year or ten years? We don't You know
 agar vah nirdosh hue to kya hoga? ham bahut pareshaan the
 The law considers a person innocent until he is found guilty
 lekin jab tak adaalat kisi nattejey par nahin pahunchatin, tab tak kya unhen kaam karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie? kya unhen sirf ghar par baithna chahie ? kya ve khud ke liye aamadani nahin kama sakate? or isliye, ham kai maheenon tak is pareshaan sthiti main the
 i could not sleep at night because i constantly felt that my act had inadvertently harmed a person whose guilt i have no idea about, who would lose the right to work and earn their livelihood
 "aamir khan (aamir Khan) ne vyakt kiya ki bina kisi faisle ke kisi ko kaam na dena kitna anuchit he kyonki abhi tak adaalat ne apana faisla nahin sunaaya he
 In a conversation with Hindustan Times, Aamir further stated how he took this bold step, “in the month of May this year, about four months ago, i received a letter from IFTDA
 IFTDA ek nirdeshak sangh he
 i think Mr
 Kapoor wrote to his institute IFTDA in his efforts to get the job done
 isliye, unhone mujhe ek patr bheja, jisamen likhaa gaya tha ki unka maamla pakshpatpurna he, or mujhe unke maamle par faisla karne ke liye adaalat kaa intjaar karnaa chahie or aise samay tak unhen apni kamai kaa adhikaar nahin khona chahie
 In all fairness, they have not been convicted
 isliye, kripaya aisa kuch na karen jo unke liye nuksaandeh he
 He is a member of our association
 aap hamaari association ke sadsy hai
 And it is very unfortunate that he cannot find work
 aise main wo kya karenge? unhone mujhase apane faisle par punarvichaar karne kii apil kii
 When i read that letter, i started feeling more guilty
 shaayad, ham galat kaam kar rahe hai
 "sapna Choudhary Video: Sapna Choudhary's loud dance on 'teri Aankhya Ka Yo Kajal', blown up the garada- See Video Aamir Khan (aamir Khan) further said, We decided to do another work to remove our discomfort
 hamane bahut si mahilaon se milane kaa faisla kiya, jinhone mistar kapur ke saath kaam kiya tha
 From this we wanted to find out, are other women also uncomfortable with them? Has any other woman also had an experience where she felt uncomfortable
 yadi aisa he, to yah hamen nishchit kar degaa ki ham unke saath aage nahin janaa chaahate hai
 So we started that practice
 ham lagbhag 10-12 mahilaon se mili yaa unke saath baat kii jinhone unke saath kaam kiya tha, head of department, assistant diarectors, costum asssistant, ityadi," abhinayta ne saajha kiya
 With the right call to delve deeper into the matter and then come to a decision, Aamir also shared how the findings were, "what we found was, without a doubt, all in favor of Mr
 Kapoor
" na keval unhone unke saath koi asuvidha mahasoos kii, balki ve unki prashansa karte nazar aaye
 He said that he was very considerate of everyone on his set
 dekhbhaal karne vaale, samvedansheel or sahaayak, ye ve shabd the jo unke varnan ke liye istemaal kiye gaye the
 But let us tell you that both Kiran and i are fully aware that even though these women must have had a great experience working with Mr
 Kapoor, this does not mean that they cannot mistreat another woman
 Were
 haalanki, main is baat se inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki jin mahilaon ne unke saath kaam kiya tha, unke saath is baatcheet se hamen sukun mila tha
 And so, taking everything into consideration, i wrote a letter back to IFTDA saying that i had reconsidered my decision, and that i would return to the film
 ”apane is nirnay par purnvichaar karne ke faisle par hindustan times ke saath baat karte hue, aamir khan ne ek saahsee nirnay liya he
 With this, Aamir is now all set to play the lead role in Gulshan Kumar's biopic "mogul", which will be directed by Subhash Kapoor
 aadhaar ko mobile number or bank khaaton samet anya yojanaon se link karne kii dedline philhal badha di gai he
 Meanwhile, in the Supreme Court, Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of Aadhaar Authority UIDAI, said that apart from biometrics, other options for Aadhaar authentication will also have to be considered
 isse pehle yuidiai aadhaar data ko surakshit karne ke liye do nai suvidhaayen laane kii ghoshnaa kar chukaa he
 Virtual ID: UEDAI brings the facility of creating a virtual ID of every Aadhaar card
 isse aapako jab bhi apni aadhaar detail kahin dene kii jarurat padegi, to aapako 12 ankon ke aadhaar number kii bajaay 16 number kii virtual idi deni hogi
 The UIDAI had said that this facility will come from March 1
 haalanki philhal isko lekar koi bhi batuidieaiki taraf se nahin hui he
 However, UIDAI had said to make it mandatory from June
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki yah suvidha june tak bhi aa paati he yaa nahin
 From June 1, it will be mandatory for all agencies to make arrangements to implement it
 iske baad koi bhi agency virtual idi sweekaar karne se inkaar nahin kar sakati he
 Apart from this, in order to keep the Aadhaar data secure, he has talked about not only fingerprint, iris, but also the facility to use his face for verification
 yuidiai ne janvari maheene main hi isaki ghoshnaa kar di thi
 According to the authority, face photos can also be used after 1 July to verify the identity of the Aadhaar card holder
 yuidiai ne bataaya ki yah suvidha un logon ke liye kaaphi zyada phydemand hogi, jinka fingerprint or iris thik tarah se kaam nahin kar paata he
 The best thing is that you do not have to go to the enrollment center to activate this feature
 athurity apane databes se aapkaa phase photo lekar actevet karegi
 After that you can avail this facility whenever you want
 yuidiai kaa kahana he ki is suvidha kii badaulat na sirf aam logon ko behatar suvidha milegi, balki isse aadhaar data kii suraksha bhi kai guna badhegi

" '' He said, "let go of your fruitless will
 jammu-kashmir, bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he or rahegaa
 Pakistan's misuse of international forums on this issue will not change the reality
 '' Critically criticizing the functioning of the United Nations, especially the Security Council, in particular, Akbaruddin said, "the aim of this core unit was to maintain peace and security but it has become unresponsive in many ways to the needs of our time
" And is ineffective in dealing with the challenges before them
 '' On the issue of terrorism, he said that the United Nations has not yet adopted a comprehensive policy on this issue, while it is one of the biggest threats to global peace and security

 i never said that
 'shukla ke soshal media acount par raajnneetik muddon par kisi tarah kii koi baat nahin likhi hui hai
 Regarding this controversial post, Shukla wrote on Twitter in her clarification on April 27, 'I want to tell officially that i have not commented like this and no one even took my consent to use my photo in this post
 'shukla kaa ye postayahandekha ja saktaa he
 India Today has investigated several interviews of Shukla on the Internet for investigation
 zyaadaatar intervyuu main shukla filmon par hi baat karte nazar aate hai
 Where, even if someone has raised political questions with them, they answer that they are like a man, who should vote
 is charchaa koyahandekha ja saktaa he, jisamen ve intervyuu lene vaale ko kehete hai, 'aapane mujhase polytical baaten poochi, isse zyada phani kya ho saktaa he
 It is clear from the investigation that Saurabh Shukla avoids political rhetoric and his name and picture were misused

 Following are some highlights of the special conversation with John after the success of this film
 
 
 kaisaa rahaa 'dhishum' kaa anubhav?bahut hi behtareen rahaa, maine yah film rohit dhawan ke liye kii he
 It was good working with Varun during the film, when i was doing Rohit's film Desi Boys, Varun was preparing for his first film
 rohit ko pehle se jaanate hai?ji haa, wo film 'hook yaa crook' main acitent diarector the tab se main unhen jaanata hum
 However, that film was not released
 maine unke pita david dhawan ke saath bhi kaam kiya he
 They have not changed even today
 maine aise kai diarectors ko dekha he jo safalataa milte hi badal jate hai
 What is important in the industry? The biggest thing in the industry is 'way of working' Zorohit comes in a good way
 wo mere chote bhai jaisaa he
 What will i say about Varun? i have trained Varun a lot during 'dhishoom' so that he looks even more powerful in every scene
 ek baar jab main 6 ghante ke liye nahin tha tab ek haadasa hua jisaki vajah se varun kii oongli main chot ai, wo behosh ho gaya
 i used to train him in the gym with me
 aap stant khud karte hai?ji haa, main apane saare stant khud hi karata hum
 i do not like having a body double at all
 mujhe ection karnaa acha lagata he or maine 'force 2' main bhi saare stant khud hi kiye hai lekin usee dauraan mere ghutano main chot bhi lag gai thi
 i still took action and went to the doctor
 vahaan ke doctor ne kaha ki pair nikaalnaa padegaa, phir maine india ke doctor ko phone kiya or bharat chalaa aayaa
 The doctor saved me here
 teesri baar meraa yahaan aaparishan hua
 Injury means failure for me and that is why i am the most fit today
 to aapako lagata he bhagwaan aapke saath hai?mere liye meri maa hi meri bhagwaan hai
 She is always with me and supports me every moment
 apcaprodeusrbanane ke peeche kya kaaran tha?main jis tarah kii filmein karnaa chahta tha, wo aksar mil nahin paati thi
 Now, as a producer, at least i am able to make such films
 aapaki parformens acchhee hoti he lekin aword nahin milte?steven spilberg or francis fort copola jaise logon ne meri parformens kii saraahna kii he lekin ye baat awords ke dauraan yahaan koi nahin samajhataa
 i don't get awards because i don't attend award ceremonies
 mere hisaab se 'madras cafe' meri best parformens thi or wo mere dil ke kaaphi kareeb he
 Do you think you have got what you wanted? No, it has not happened yet
 main bahut kuch karnaa chahta hum, kirdaaron kii khoj karnaa chahta hum
 Acting is first love and production is second
 
 
 mujhe kamedi kaaphi pasand he
 To whom do you give credit for your success? i owe it to myself because i work hard for this
 saath hi mere liye saport system bhi bahut hai lekin unke hote hue bhi mehnat mujhe hi kerani hogi
 Hollywood has a plan? No, for now only India has to do such films which are also released in the international market

 nai party banaaenge yaa bhaajapa main shaamil honge? saansad baijayant jai pandas ko biju janata dal (bijd) ne jab se party se nilambit kiya or unhone party kii sadsyta se istipha diya he,odishake rajnatik galiyare main yah lakh take kaa sawaal bana hua he
 Earlier, the late Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, one of the people closest to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, had also formed his own party after breaking away from the BJD but was not able to create much impact
 isliye ek sambhaavna yah bhi jataai ja rahi he ki pandas 2019 kaa aam chunaav apane kshetra cendrapara se bhaajapa samarthit ummidavaar kii tarah ladenge
 However, Panda has also been invited by the Congress to join the party
 pandas ne kaha bhi ki "har dal main mere sampark hai
 But the overwhelming presence of BJP leaders in the Shraddha ceremony of his father, industrialist Bansidhar Panda, tells a different story
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne unhen phone karke apni samvednaa vyakt kii
 Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan visited his house and according to sources he had a one-on-one conversation with BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav
 do baar rajyasabha (2000 se 2009 tak) rahe tathaa do baar loksabhaa (2009 or 2014) sadsy bane pandas kehete hai, "main vikasparak sansadeey sudhaar ke paksh main hum or vahi karuunga jo desh or odisha ke liye uchit lagegaa
 "his statements on a TV channel of his supporters and the attacks on the new government have made it clear that the prospects of his return to the BJD are almost gone
" bijd ke netaaon ne bhi na sirf unke khilaaf tikhe bayaan die hai, balki yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unke jane se party kii sambhaavnaaen majboot hongi
 The BJD also alleges that Panda did not campaign in Kendrapada in the 2017 local body elections and acted against the party
 lekin pandas kaa kahana he ki unka kaarykram hi nahin tay kiya gaya
 According to Panda, he has resigned from the membership of the Lok Sabha, but the Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has not accepted because he is on a foreign tour
 bijd ke netaa isamen bhi andeh vyakt karte hai
 By the way, Panda has added several emotional aspects to the resignation letter from the party
 apane patr main unhone bijd ke sansthaapak, naveen patnayak ke pita biju patnayak se apane pita kii mitrataa kaa ullekh kiya
 He also posted some old photos on Twitter, citing family relations of Biju Patnaik and his father
 bijd ke netaa unke is kadam ko sahanubhuti batorne kii koshish bataa rahe hai
 Perhaps there is a reason behind this speculation that they will not directly join BJP and will contest elections like a supported candidate
 darasal 2014 ke chunaavon kebaad hi pandas ke naveen patnayak se rishte khattey hone lage the
 Panda says, "something was changing over the last three-four years
 main nishane par tha
 The new troupe built around the Chief Minister has almost captured the party and the government
 ek afasar fund jutata he or vahi party fund or tikat baant rahaa he
 Many party leaders also say this to the tongue-tied
 ''pandas jis afasar kaa zikr kar rahe hai, ve darasal mukhyamantri ke nijee sachiv ve
 K
 pandian hai
 Panda's channel and media house have been continuously running stories against Pandian
 pandas ne twit karke bhi pandian ko apane nishkasana kaa mukhya sajeeshkarta bataaya he
 Panda was suspended in January on charges of anti-party activities
 bijd ke pravaktaa es
 N
 paatra ne kaha, "baijayant ke nishkasana kaa faisla bijd pramukh tathaa mukhyamantri naveen patnayak kaa tha
 He is accused of anti-party activities and misuse of MP funds
 ''bijd netaaon ke mutabik pandas ke sur kaaphi kuch bhaajapa se milte rahe hai
 Two reasons were cited for Panda's suspension
 ek, bhaajapa netaaon se unki badhati nazdikiyaan or duusare, kathith taur par unke dwaara saansad nidhi kaa durupyog karnaa
 But Panda dismisses it outright
 party se nilamban ke samay bhi pandas ne likhaa tha, "naveen patnayak ji yah kaaphi dukh kii baat he ki aap mere khilaaf ho rahi sajeesh nahin dekh sake jo ek iees afasar ke netritv main kii ja rahi he
 i reject all the allegations leveled by the party
 ye sabhi aarope galat or aadharahin hai
 "the pandas accuse themselves of repeated humiliation and even violence by BJD activists at the inauguration of the water project in Mahanga in May 2017
" bakaul pandas, us hamale main unke kandhe main chot ai or police mook darshak bani rahi
 He also alleged that his father was prevented from paying homage to the BJD leaders in Shraddh
 unke pita ke shraadh main bijd kii ore se bhubaneshwar ke saansad prasann patsaani or ek rajyamantri pahunche the
 In fact, pandas have been raising uncomfortable issues for a long time
 unhone pichley saal sthaneey nikaay chunaavon ke baad odisha ke pramukh oriya samachar patr samaaj main likhe lekh main kaha tha ki party mul vichaardhaara se hat rahi he
 It is a time for contemplation and brainstorming
 is lekh ne bakaul panda party main sudhaar laane ke bajaay unheen ke liye museebataan khadi kar di
 Panda says, "in his last three terms, Naveen Babu used to get into action immediately after a slight inkling of corruption
 unhone iees afasaron or cabinet mantriyon ko bhi chalata karne main der nahin lagaai
 
 
 But after 2014, there was no action in the corruption case
 chit fund ghotaale main giraftaar party netaaon ke khilaaf bhi koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau, crimes against children have increased by 50 percent in the last four years
 yah sarkaar ke nikammepan kii hi misaal he
 The new congregation is misusing power
 ''pandas ko yah baat salti rahi he ki jis party kii jadon ko unhone bhi sinchaa, usee ke logon ne unhen achhut bana diya
 However, BJD leaders allege that Panda is doing all this to avoid charges against him
 un par 2014 ke chunaavon main apane halafname main adhuri vittiya jaankaree dene kaa ek maamla chal rahaa he
 The sub-divisional Judicial Magistrate of Kendrapara ordered a criminal case to be filed
 lekin hycourt ne roak laga di he
 Panda says, "my affidavit was prepared by senior lawyers
 vaise bhi yah koi aapraadhik nahin, divaani maamla he
 However, this incident can have an impact in Odisha politics
 bhaajapa ko pandas main sambhaavnaaen najar aa rahi hai
 Dharmendra Pradhan says, "everyone with similar ideology and faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah is welcome in BJP
" '' lekin oont kis karavat baithegaa, iskaa pataa agle saal loksabhaa chunaavon main hi chalegaa

 The matter is in court and it will be decided by the same, but the video which is being considered as proof of Kanhaiya being 'traitor', in reality, the curiosity of the video comes out clearly

 ceiling ke khilaaf bhukh hadtaal na karne kii khabar aate hi arvind kejariwal virodhiyon or vyapaariyon ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 However, Aam Aadmi Party mlas and trade wing leaders have defended Kejriwal by announcing the hunger strike and later deferring it
 bhukh hadtaal taalane ke sawaal par aam aadmi party ke kasturba nagar se vidhayak madan laal kaa kahana he ki 2 april se supreme court main ceiling par sunwaayee ho rahi he or aise vakt main bhukh hadtaal ko dawaab banane kii niti samajha jayega lekin hamen dawaab nahin balki apana paksh supreme court main majbootee se rakhana he
 Further, AAP MLA Madan Lal said that apart from fighting the legal battle at present, they demand BJP to bring such a bill so that the relief from sealing for a year or more will be given
 is dauraan bijepi policy banaae taaki ceiling jaise maamle kaa samaadhaan nikle or vyapaariyon ko laabh mili
 On the question of announcing the hunger strike, the MLA replied that there was a big difference between the hearing in the Supreme Court at that time and the hearing that started on 2 April
 us samay monitering kamity ko aadesh the ki jahaan- jahaan gaiyrkanoonee atikaraman ho vahaan ection liya jaae
 Right now, there is a need to find the best good lawyer appointed in the Supreme Court
 haalanki aam aadmi party kaa maananaa he ki ceiling kii asal jimmedaar congress he
 Madan Lal said that the process of sealing started in 2006, when the Congress government was both state and center
 us vakt congress kii sarkaar ceiling se bachaane ke liye ek adhyadesh lekar ai, jahaan ek saal kii raahat di gai thi
 The Congress promised that a policy would be put in place during a year to protect traders from sealing or other actions
 'aap' kaa aarope he ki congress ne 2007 se 2014 tak rajya yaa centre kii satta main rahete hue kuch nahin kiya
 Madan Lal defended his Chief Minister's announcement that 'there is no justification for hunger strike today
 vyapaariyon ke saath koi vishwasghaat nahin hua he
 From Congress to BJP, no one has given relief from sealing whereas Aam Aadmi Party has nothing in its hands
 bhukh hadtaal aage bhi kar sakate hai lekin philhal bhukh hadtaal se samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa
 On the other hand, Brijesh, the Convener of the Aam Aadmi Party Trade Wing, claims that Arvind Kejriwal postponed the hunger strike only after taking advice from the lawyers
 goyal ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki 'mukhyamantri ne yah nahin kaha he ki wo bhukh hadtaal par nahin baithenge balki ise kuch vakt ke liye taal diya gaya he
 The big lawyers met Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and told that a hearing in the case of sealing is to be held daily from April 2, in which case the decision of the court can come against the businessmen
 ' aam aadam party kaa daawa he ki supreme court main 2 bade vakil sarkaar ne niyukt kiye hai or arvind kejariwal khud puure maamle par najar banaaye hue hai

 Every marriage deals with issues like dowry, patriarchal barriers, status and makes social comments on them, which are narrated through the wedding photographer (shashank Arora) who attends every wedding
 iske mukhya kirdaar hai tara (shobhita dhulipal) or karan (arjuna maathur), jo dilli main wedding planning udhyam chalaate hai
 Tara, who comes from a modest background, gets quite high in life by marrying a rich industrialist (jim Sarbh); Karan, on the other hand, is deeply immersed in debts and his overturned romantic life is a series of one night stands with men found in liquor

 While the show does not make sarcastic comments on the inane demands and deceit seen at these weddings, it is still worth watching a series of episodes in one meeting, including the difficulties of Tara's wedding and His identity crisis produces the most powerful and effective confrontation

 In front of this committee, former Governor Raghuram Rajan has given a reply of 17 pages which is also on his blog
 aap pard sakate hai
 In this, Raghuram Rajan has said one thing
 bure lone kaa bada hissaa 2006-08 se badhanaa shuru hota he
 The economy was booming at that time
 power project bajet ke bheetar or tay samay se puure ho rahe the
 At this time, banks make mistakes
 growth kaa zyaada anumaan lagaate hai or bina ehtiyaat ke lone baantnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Banks gave loans on the basis of project report
 apni taraf se chaanbin nahin kii
 a promoter said that it was the banks that were pressurizing them to take as much money as they wanted
 bina soche samajhe paise lutaaney kaa yah daur duniya ke kai deshon main chalaa tha
 Raghuram Rajan did not say concretely whether there was corruption in lending or not
 unhone zarur kaha ki ninsadeh kuch bhrashtachar hua tha
 But you cannot so easily differentiate between banker's incompetence and corruption
 saaf he ki bank ativishwaas ke shikaar the
 Many did not do their analysis
 yah system kii kamazori thi jiske kaaran baahar se dakhal dene kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Rajan in his reply blames the banks' negligence
 ve kehete bhi hai ki siio kii sampatti kii jaanch honi chahie
 He has said that some amount will be fraudulent
 phir wo sansad kii aankalan samiti ko likhte hai ki When i was governor, the Reserve Bank also created a cell to track bank frauds so that we could first catch the fraud and give it to the investigating agencies
 maine kuch hiprophile frod cese kii suchi pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhi bheji thi or kaha tha ki ham ek do logon ko pakadaney ke liye kadam uthaane honge
 i do not know what progress
 is maamle ko argent rup main dekha janaa chahie
 Rajan has not written in his reply when the letter was sent to the PMO and who were the people in that list
 di vir main swati chaturvedi ne april 2015 ke hindustan times kii ek report kaa hawala dete hue rajan ke is baat ko aage badhaayaa he
 According to the newspaper, Rajan had reported about 17,500 crore fraud
 isamen vinsom diamond and jewelri, zum developers, tiwari group, surya vinayak idstry sahit kuch companiyon ke naam die the
 The newspaper quoted sources as saying
 kya reserve bank ko ab yah nahin bataanaa chahie ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ko 17,500 karod ke frod kii jo list di gai usamen kis kis ke naam hai
 What action has been taken against each other? kya pradhanmantri karyaalay ko nahin bataanaa chahie ki jab list saunpi gai to kya karrwai hui
 The answer has not yet come as to what action was taken by Rajan on the list of pmos
 swati chaturvedi ne vir main likhaa he ki is suchi kii jaankaree vitt mantralay ko bhi thi
 So what did the finance ministry do
 is par koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Meanwhile, on September 12, in the case of loan default of around 9000 crores, absconding Vijay Mallya has said in a London court that he had met the Finance Minister to settle the case before leaving India
 us samay vitt mantri arun jetali the
 a London court saw a video of Barrack No
 12 of Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail as Mallya did not like India's jail
 vahaan insaan nahin rah saktaa he
 The judge has to decide whether to send Malaya to India to face trial
 court se baahar aakar kaha ki unhone bharat chhodane se pehle vitt mantri se mulaakaat kii thi
 Vijay Mallya left India on 2 March 2016
 iske turant baad vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan aayaa
 He said that there is no truth in Mallya's statement
 maalya ne ye nahin kaha ki jetali ne unase kya kaha
 Jaitley told what he told Mallya
 bijepi daawa karti he ki maalya ne 2011 main pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat kii thi
 Will have yahaan sawaal he ki kya maalya ne bhaagane ke do din pehle kisi se mulaakaat kii thi
 This question has been arising since the escape, then why did the Finance Minister not reply
 congress kahati he ki maalya aakhri baar bijepi ke samarthan se rajya sabha saansad bane the
 However, before this, Congress supported Mallya for Rajya Sabha
 tippaniyan Not only this, while talking to Indian journalists in London on 25 August, Rahul Gandhi said that he knew that Mallya had met top BJP leaders before leaving the country
 rahul ne kaha tha ki ve naam nahin lenge
 Prior to Rahul, Congress also alleged in its first press conference after Mallya's escape that Mallya had met a senior cabinet minister before running away
 rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan us din enditivi par chalaa tha
 The New Indian Express was featured on Asian Age, Hindu, Outlook, Firstpost
 or bhi kai jagah par chapa hoga yaa dikhaaya gaya hoga
 Then why did not that one of the top leaders of BJP say that Mallya had tried to meet me but i did not give up
 kya acha nahin hota ki arun jetali tabhi ye bayaan jari kar dete jab rahul gandhi landan main bole yaa usee samay bol dete jab 2016 main congress ne yah aarope lagaaya tha
 The Finance Minister could have immediately told the CBI as a case had already been registered in this case
 ek sawaal or he
 mps can say this
 rajya sabha ke sabhapati or upasabhapati bataa sakate hai
 Is it a misuse of privilege to meet a minister while walking in the corridor of Parliament as an MP

 In front of this committee, former Governor Raghuram Rajan has given a reply of 17 pages which is also on his blog
 aap pard sakate hai
 In this, Raghuram Rajan has said one thing
 bure lone kaa bada hissaa 2006-08 se badhanaa shuru hota he
 The economy was booming at that time
 power project bajet ke bheetar or tay samay se puure ho rahe the
 At this time, banks make mistakes
 growth kaa zyaada anumaan lagaate hai or bina ehtiyaat ke lone baantnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Banks gave loans on the basis of project report
 apni taraf se chaanbin nahin kii
 a promoter said that it was the banks that were pressurizing them to take as much money as they wanted
 bina soche samajhe paise lutaaney kaa yah daur duniya ke kai deshon main chalaa tha
 Raghuram Rajan did not say concretely whether there was corruption in lending or not
 unhone zarur kaha ki ninsadeh kuch bhrashtachar hua tha
 But you cannot so easily differentiate between banker's incompetence and corruption
 saaf he ki bank ativishwaas ke shikaar the
 Many did not do their analysis
 yah system kii kamazori thi jiske kaaran baahar se dakhal dene kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Rajan in his reply blames the banks' negligence
 ve kehete bhi hai ki siio kii sampatti kii jaanch honi chahie
 He has said that some amount will be fraudulent
 phir wo sansad kii aankalan samiti ko likhte hai ki When i was governor, the Reserve Bank also created a cell to track bank frauds so that we could first catch the fraud and give it to the investigating agencies
 maine kuch hiprophile frod cese kii suchi pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bhi bheji thi or kaha tha ki ham ek do logon ko pakadaney ke liye kadam uthaane honge
 i do not know what progress

 According to the newspaper, Rajan had reported about 17,500 crore fraud

 The newspaper quoted sources as saying

 What action has been taken against each other? kya pradhanmantri karyaalay ko nahin bataanaa chahie ki jab list saunpi gai to kya karrwai hui
 The answer has not yet come as to what action was taken by Rajan on the list of pmos

 Meanwhile, on September 12, in the case of loan default of around 9000 crores, absconding Vijay Mallya has said in a London court that he had met the Finance Minister to settle the case before leaving India

 Vijay Mallya left India on 2 March 2016
 iske turant baad vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan aayaa
 He said that there is no truth in Mallya's statement
 maalya ne ye nahin kaha ki jetali ne unase kya kaha
 Jaitley told what he told Mallya
 bijepi daawa karti he ki maalya ne 2011 main pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat kii thi
 Will have yahaan sawaal he ki kya maalya ne bhaagane ke do din pehle kisi se mulaakaat kii thi
 This question has been arising since the escape, then why did the Finance Minister not reply
 congress kahati he ki maalya aakhri baar bijepi ke samarthan se rajya sabha saansad bane the
 However, before this, Congress supported Mallya for Rajya Sabha
 tippaniyan Not only this, while talking to Indian journalists in London on 25 August, Rahul Gandhi said that he knew that Mallya had met top BJP leaders before leaving the country
 rahul ne kaha tha ki ve naam nahin lenge
 Prior to Rahul, Congress also alleged in its first press conference after Mallya's escape that Mallya had met a senior cabinet minister before running away
 rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan us din enditivi par chalaa tha
 The New Indian Express was featured on Asian Age, Hindu, Outlook, Firstpost

 Then why did not that one of the top leaders of BJP say that Mallya had tried to meet me but i did not give up
 kya acha nahin hota ki arun jetali tabhi ye bayaan jari kar dete jab rahul gandhi landan main bole yaa usee samay bol dete jab 2016 main congress ne yah aarope lagaaya tha
 The Finance Minister could have immediately told the CBI as a case had already been registered in this case

 Is it a misuse of privilege to meet a minister while walking in the corridor of Parliament as an MP

 On March 2, Mallya escaped
 5 march ko bainko ne maamla darj kiya
 After going
 rajan apane jawaab main bainkon kii laaparvaahee ko zimmedaar bataate hai
 They also say that the ceo's assets should be investigated
 unhone kuch raashi ke frad kiye jane kii baat kahi he
 Then he writes to the Assessing Committee of Parliament that jab main governor tha tab reserve bank ne bank frad par nazar rakhane ke liye ek cell bhi banaaya tha taaki ham frod ko pehle pakad kar jaanch agenciyon ko de saken
 i had also sent a list of some high profile fraud cases to the Prime Minister's Office and said that we will have to take steps to catch one or two people
 kya pragati hui, mujhe nahin pataa
 This case should be seen as an incident
 rajan ne apane jawaab main nahin likhaa he ki piemo ko kab patr bheja tha or us list main koun koun log the
 Swati Chaturvedi in The Wire has taken Rajan's point forward by citing a report of Hindustan Times of April 2015
 akhbaar ke anusaar rajan ne 17,500 karod ke frod ke bare main soochna di thi
 In this, names of companies including Winsome Diamond and Jewelery, Zoom Developers, Tiwari Group, Surya Vinayak Industries were given
 akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa tha
 Should the Reserve Bank no longer tell who the names of whom are in the list of frauds worth 17,500 crores given to the Prime Minister's Office
 kis-kis ke khilaaf kya karrwai hui he
 Shouldn't the Prime Minister's Office tell what action was taken when the list was submitted? abhi yah jawaab nahin aayaa he ki rajan ne piemo ko jo suchi thi us par kya ection hua
 Swati Chaturvedi has written in the wire that the information of this list was also available to the Finance Ministry
 to vitt mantralay ne kya kiya
 There is no response to this
 is bich 12 sitambar ko kareeb 9000 karod ke lone diphalt ke maamle main faraar vijay maalya ne landan kii adaalat main kaha he ki bharat chhodane se pehle maamle ko settle karne ke liye vitt mantri se mila tha
 The Finance Minister at that time was Arun Jaitley
 landan kii adaalat main mumbai ke arthur road jail ke barrack number 12 kaa video dekha gaya kyonki maalya ko india kaa jail pasand nahin aayaa he
 a human cannot live there
 jaj ko tay karnaa he ki malaya ko mukademe kaa saamana karne ke liye bharat bheja jaae yaa nahin
 Coming out of the court, he said that he had met the finance minister before leaving India
 vijay maalya 2 march 2016 ko bharat chhod diya tha
 Soon after, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's statement came
 unhone kaha ki maalya ke bayaan main koi sachai nahin he
 Mallya did not say what Jaitley told him
 jetali ne bataa diya ki unhone maalya ko kya kaha
 The BJP claims that Mallya met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2011
 kii hogi
 The question here is whether Mallya met anyone two days before his escape
 yah sawaal to bhaagane ke baad se uth rahaa he tab vitt mantri ne jawaab kyon nahin diya
 The Congress says that Mallya became the last Rajya Sabha MP with the support of the BJP
 vaise iske pehle congress ne maalya ko rajya sabha ke liye saport kiya tha
 The comments yahi nahin 25 agast ko landan main bhartiya patrakaron se baat karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki maalya ne desh chhodane se pehle bijepi ke sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Rahul had said that he would not take names
 rahul se pehle congress ne bhi maalya ke bhaagane ke baad ke apane pehle press conference main aarope lagaaya tha ki maalya ne bhaagane se pehle kisi varisht cabinet mantri se mulaakaat kii he
 This statement of Rahul Gandhi went on NDTV that day
 new indian express, asian age, hindu, outluk, firstpost par chapa tha
 It will be printed or shown at many other places
 tab bijepi ke chotii ke netaaon main se us netaa ne kyon nahin kaha tha ki maalya ne mujhase mulaakaat karne kaa prayaas kiya tha magar maine bhav nahin diya
 Isn't it good that Arun Jaitley would have issued these statements only when Rahul Gandhi spoke in London or would have spoken at the same time when the Congress had made this charge in 2016
 vitt mantri turant sibiai ko bataa sakate the kyonki uske pehle to is maamle main cese darj ho chukaa tha
 One more question
 yah baat saansad bataa sakate hai
 The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can state
 kya saansad ke taur par sansad ke galiyare main chalate phirte kisi mantri se milanaa visheshadhikaar kaa galat istamaal hota he
 Do the mps go ashore when ministers pass through the corridor, they do not talk
 agar koi mil le, baat kar le to kya us netaa ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar ke hanan kaa maamla darj hota he
 There is a news of 10 March 2016 from the Times of India
 is akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki state bank of india ne maalya ke khilaaf maamla darj karne main deree kar di
 On February 28, 2016, officials of State Bank of India and a few more banks met the law firm of lawyer Dushyant Dave
 vakil ne salaah di ki turant maamla darj karen
 It would have been a Monday on March 1
 2 march ko maalya bhaag gaya
 On March 5, Banks filed a case
 jane ke baad
 According to the newspaper, Rajan had reported about 17,500 crore fraud
 isamen vinsom diamond and jewelri, zum developers, tiwari group, surya vinayak idstry sahit kuch companiyon ke naam die the
 The newspaper quoted sources as saying
 kya reserve bank ko ab yah nahin bataanaa chahie ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ko 17,500 karod ke frod kii jo list di gai usamen kis kis ke naam hai
 What action has been taken against each other? kya pradhanmantri karyaalay ko nahin bataanaa chahie ki jab list saunpi gai to kya karrwai hui
 The answer has not yet come as to what action was taken by Rajan on the list of pmos
 swati chaturvedi ne vir main likhaa he ki is suchi kii jaankaree vitt mantralay ko bhi thi
 So what did the finance ministry do
 is par koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Meanwhile, on September 12, in the case of loan default of around 9000 crores, absconding Vijay Mallya has said in a London court that he had met the Finance Minister to settle the case before leaving India
 us samay vitt mantri arun jetali the
 a London court saw a video of Barrack No
 12 of Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail as Mallya did not like India's jail
 vahaan insaan nahin rah saktaa he

 court se baahar aakar kaha ki unhone bharat chhodane se pehle vitt mantri se mulaakaat kii thi
 Vijay Mallya left India on 2 March 2016
 iske turant baad vitt mantri arun jetali kaa bayaan aayaa
 He said that there is no truth in Mallya's statement
 maalya ne ye nahin kaha ki jetali ne unase kya kaha
 Jaitley told what he told Mallya
 bijepi daawa karti he ki maalya ne 2011 main pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat kii thi

 This question has been arising since the escape, then why did the Finance Minister not reply

 rahul gandhi kaa yah bayaan us din enditivi par chalaa tha
 The New Indian Express was featured on Asian Age, Hindu, Outlook, Firstpost
 or bhi kai jagah par chapa hoga yaa dikhaaya gaya hoga
 Then why did not that one of the top leaders of BJP say that Mallya had tried to meet me but i did not give up
 kya acha nahin hota ki arun jetali tabhi ye bayaan jari kar dete jab rahul gandhi landan main bole yaa usee samay bol dete jab 2016 main congress ne yah aarope lagaaya tha
 The Finance Minister could have immediately told the CBI as a case had already been registered in this case
 ek sawaal or he
 mps can say this
 rajya sabha ke sabhapati or upasabhapati bataa sakate hai
 Is it a misuse of privilege to meet a minister while walking in the corridor of Parliament as an MP
 kya galiyare main jab mantri guzarate hai to saansad log kinare ho jate hai, baat nahin karte hai
 If someone meets, talks, then is there a case of breach of privilege against that leader
 10 march 2016 kii ek khabar he times aaf india kii
 The newspaper quoted sources as saying that the State Bank of India delayed the filing of a case against Mallya
 28 farvari 2016 ko state bank of india or kuch or bainkon ke adhikariyon ne vakil dushyant dave ke lau form se mulaakaat kii
 The lawyer advised that immediately file a case
 1 march ko somvaar rahaa hoga
 On March 2, Mallya escaped
 5 march ko bainko ne maamla darj kiya
 After going
 abhi yah jawaab nahin aayaa he ki rajan ne piemo ko jo suchi thi us par kya ection hua
 Swati Chaturvedi has written in the wire that the information of this list was also available to the Finance Ministry
 to vitt mantralay ne kya kiya
 There is no response to this
 is bich 12 sitambar ko kareeb 9000 karod ke lone diphalt ke maamle main faraar vijay maalya ne landan kii adaalat main kaha he ki bharat chhodane se pehle maamle ko settle karne ke liye vitt mantri se mila tha
 The Finance Minister at that time was Arun Jaitley
 landan kii adaalat main mumbai ke arthur road jail ke barrack number 12 kaa video dekha gaya kyonki maalya ko india kaa jail pasand nahin aayaa he
 a human cannot live there
 jaj ko tay karnaa he ki malaya ko mukademe kaa saamana karne ke liye bharat bheja jaae yaa nahin
 Coming out of the court, he said that he had met the finance minister before leaving India
 vijay maalya 2 march 2016 ko bharat chhod diya tha
 Soon after, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's statement came
 unhone kaha ki maalya ke bayaan main koi sachai nahin he
 Mallya did not say what Jaitley told him
 jetali ne bataa diya ki unhone maalya ko kya kaha
 The BJP claims that Mallya met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2011
 kii hogi
 The question here is whether Mallya met anyone two days before his escape
 yah sawaal to bhaagane ke baad se uth rahaa he tab vitt mantri ne jawaab kyon nahin diya
 The Congress says that Mallya became the last Rajya Sabha MP with the support of the BJP
 vaise iske pehle congress ne maalya ko rajya sabha ke liye saport kiya tha
 The comments yahi nahin 25 agast ko landan main bhartiya patrakaron se baat karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki maalya ne desh chhodane se pehle bijepi ke sheersh netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Rahul had said that he would not take names
 rahul se pehle congress ne bhi maalya ke bhaagane ke baad ke apane pehle press conference main aarope lagaaya tha ki maalya ne bhaagane se pehle kisi varisht cabinet mantri se mulaakaat kii he
 This statement of Rahul Gandhi went on NDTV that day
 new indian express, asian age, hindu, outluk, firstpost par chapa tha
 It will be printed or shown at many other places
 tab bijepi ke chotii ke netaaon main se us netaa ne kyon nahin kaha tha ki maalya ne mujhase mulaakaat karne kaa prayaas kiya tha magar maine bhav nahin diya
 Isn't it good that Arun Jaitley would have issued these statements only when Rahul Gandhi spoke in London or would have spoken at the same time when the Congress had made this charge in 2016
 vitt mantri turant sibiai ko bataa sakate the kyonki uske pehle to is maamle main cese darj ho chukaa tha
 One more question
 yah baat saansad bataa sakate hai
 The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can state
 kya saansad ke taur par sansad ke galiyare main chalate phirte kisi mantri se milanaa visheshadhikaar kaa galat istamaal hota he
 Do the mps go ashore when ministers pass through the corridor, they do not talk
 agar koi mil le, baat kar le to kya us netaa ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar ke hanan kaa maamla darj hota he
 There is a news of 10 March 2016 from the Times of India
 is akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he ki state bank of india ne maalya ke khilaaf maamla darj karne main deree kar di
 On February 28, 2016, officials of State Bank of India and a few more banks met the law firm of lawyer Dushyant Dave
 vakil ne salaah di ki turant maamla darj karen
 It would have been a Monday on March 1

 Former aggressive batsman, speech commentator and then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Navjot Singh Sidhu has been a very famous star on TV for his jumalas, proverbs
 par in dinon unke sitare gardish main aate najar aa rahe hai
 However, controversies never left Navjot Singh Sidhu's cricketer life or political journey
 apane cricket jivan main un par hatya ke prayaas kaa maamla bana or us par unhen haal main raahat mili he
 His aggressive attitude was also seen on the cricket field and the Indian team captain Mo
 ajaharuddin se unki kabhi nahin bani
 His retirement was also full of controversies when he left the tour of England midway after a skirmish with the captain
 yahi siddhu, chhodkar congress main shaamil hue to us samay bhi unhone ek kism kaa vivaad hi khadaa kiya tha
 In fact, in the Congress session, Sidhu had already recited the jokes in praise of UPA President Sonia Gandhi
 jab siddhu bhaajapa main the, us vakt saal 2013 main siddhu ne narendra modi kii tarif karte hue kaha tha ki narendra bhai ke janmdin par yahaan (dilli) aana thik vaisaa hi he, jaisaa ''koi mitti kaa dhela gulabon kii kyari main aa gaya ho
 For example, a straw will stick on the Shivling that flows in the Narmada
 ''congress ke 84wein adhiveshan main siddhu ne dobaaraa usee sher kaa istemaal kiya, jo unhone kabhi narendra modi ke liye kaha tha
 He said, "sidhu is feeling exactly the same in the Congress session, as if a straw is stuck on the Shivalinga flowing in the Narmada
 vaisaa siddhu mahakumbh main aakar mahasoos kar rahaa he
 "but the same Sidhu, who was the Jat Sikh face of BJP in Punjab, left the BJP and went to Congress
" kyon gaye
 
 
 There have been many talks on this
 par pulavama main siarpief par aatankwaadi hamale par apane bayaan se siddhu funs gaye
 On the terror attack, he said, "such people (terrorists) do not have any country, religion and caste
" chand logon kii vajah se puure raashtra (pakistan) ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Navjot Singh Sidhu remained in the center of Punjab's politics in the year 2018 due to his own activities and sometimes because of appearing in TV shows since joining Congress
 khaastaur par, pakistan ke liye apane nae prem ke chalate unhone kareeb paanch maheene tak rashtriya surkhiyon main jagah pai
 The issue is whether Pakistani cricketer and political leader Imran Khan has to go to his swearing-in after becoming the Prime Minister, hug the Pakistan Army Chief, or his stand on the Kartarpur Corridor
 siddhu par unki purv party, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne siyaasi hamale tej kiye to unki party congress main punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne bhi unpar tanj ksaa
 Sidhu did not budge despite the union minister terming him a traitor after he hugged Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa during Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony last August
 haal hi main chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 70 se zyada chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit karne ke baad apni aawaaj khone kii kagaar par pahunche chuke siddhu ne pakistani sambandhon par unke judaav ko lekar hamalavar hue logon ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh jari rakhaa
 Throughout the year, Sidhu had disputes with his fellow cabinet ministers and left no opportunity to show the officers their place, which led to disputes
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki vah is baat ko lekar niraash hai, kyonki janata ke bich unki prasiddhi ke baavjood punjab kii sattarudh congress or rajya sarkaar se unhen vah sthaan nahin mila, jiske vah hakdaar hai
 Sidhu had recently given rise to a new controversy by questioning the leadership of Amarinder Singh during a press conference in Hyderabad
 is vivaad ke kaaran kam se kam chah cabinet mantriyon ne unase istife kii maang kii
 The controversy ended when Amarinder did not give much precedence to the issue and Sidhu overturned his statement and described Amarinder as "a father figure"
 thodaa peeche chalate hai
 Navjot Singh Sidhu joined the BJP in 2004, just before the elections
 unke liye amritsar kii seat bhi pakki thi
 The BJP was assuming that a Punjabi face would be needed to beat the Congress in the Congress stronghold Amritsar, which is also famous
 amritsar seat par 1991, 1996 or 1999 main congress ke raghunandan laal bhaatia kaa kabja rahaa tha
 The BJP once won only here in 1998
 bhaajapa ko punjab main hinduon kii or us par bhi baniyon kii party mana jaataa tha
 With the arrival of Sidhu, that deficiency was getting removed
 bhaajapa ko lag rahaa tha ki amritsar main khel sirf khilaadi siddhu hi kar sakate hai
 And the same thing happened
 2004 main jab bharat udai kaa naaraa naakaam ho gaya, to bhi amritsar main siddhuism chal niklaa
 Sidhu flew from Amritsar under the nose of the ruling Congress
 disambar, 2006 main siddhu ko road rej vaale puraane maamle main teen saal kii jail kii sajaa hui
 He resigned from the membership of the Lok Sabha as per rules
 phir supreme court ne unki arji par sunwaayee karte hue sajaa nirast kar di
 The next year assembly elections were held in Punjab
 prakaash singh badal ke netritv main shiromani akali dal or bhaajapa gathbandhan satta main lautaa
 The by-elections were also held on the Amritsar Lok Sabha seat
 tab siddhu ne punjab sarkaar main vitt mantri surinder singla ko 77 hajaar voton se haraaya
 Since then, Sidhu started getting angry with his party
 unhen aisa mahasoos hone laga tha ki party unka istemaal vot khinchne ke liye to karti he magar pad ke maamle main unki ahmiyat na ke baraabar he
 The Congress dominated Punjab in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 magar siddhu jeet main antar kam hone ke baavjood apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 Sidhu considered it appropriate not to miss the Pathankot rally in Narendra Modi's election campaign in June 2013
 tab ke party adhyaksh rajnath singh kii amritsar raily main bhi ve gaayab rahe
 Arun Jaitley has demanded the Amritsar seat for himself in the Lok Sabha elections, which was also accepted
 par isse siddhu ko naaraaz hona lajimi bhi tha
 But from then on Navjot Singh Sidhu's attitude got sharper
 kabhi unke aam aadmi party main shaamil hone ke charche hue to kabhi punjab bhaajapa adhyaksh banane ke
 But the BJP high command offered Sidhu all the seats of the state and he also agreed
 lekin uske kuch hi mahino baad siddhu ne bhaajapa chhod di or congress kaa daaman pakad liya
 Perhaps under the shadow of Captain Amarinder Singh in the Congress, Sidhu also wanted something big for himself
 shaayad, punjab ke up-mukhyamantri kaa pad
 But the Captain had won the assembly elections on his own
 so cabinet banaate vakt bhi unki hi chalani thi
 Opponent Sidhu was given the Ministry of Tourism
 siddhu tivi par aate rahe, baaten karte rahe, bayaan dete rahe
 But after the Pulwama attack, his statement has supported his take in which his image has become that of a Pakistan-loving leader
 kartarpur galiyare main unki sakriyata ho yaa imran ke shapath grahan main unka janaa or general bajva ko gale lagaana
 
 
 Everything is in the memory of social media
 siddhu trol hue or afvaahen ud rahi hai ki ek nijee televijan par aade vaale kapil sharma ke sho main se unka patta saaf ho gaya he
 Nonetheless, Sidhu will have to separate politics and diplomacy from TV shows, with provocations to defy applause on TV
 agar vah punjab yaa rashtriya raajnneeti main apane liye koi bada sthaan chaahate hai to unhen thodi raajnneetik kootneeti seekhni hogi
 Otherwise, his image is becoming a controversial and sometimes nonsensical statement to remain in the discussion

 Dadri incident very close to the country's capital Delhi is on the tongue of everyone these days
 is ghatana ke bagaiyr in dinon koi bhi rajnatik yaa saahitiyik bahes puri nahin maani ja rahi
 Alam is that even on very delicate and sensitive forums of literature, this incident is registering its presence
 is nae daur main, jabaki jamaane kaa chaal- chalan apana cheharaa badal rahaa he
 New and scientific thinking is trying to make its new place in the society
 nae- nae avishkaron ne insaani jaruraton ke rang- dhang badal die hai or aise main siyasat ke vahi puraane ghise pite bahaane is baat par muhar lagaate najar aate hai
 Politicians in this country still have not changed

 Thunder is that it should be used correctly
 hindi ke jane- maane lekhak or apane nukkadnatakonki rachana ke liye duniya bhar main mashhoor asagar vajahat to kam se kam aisa hi maanate hai
 In his third stop of the book release program, Asghar Wajahat arrived at Hindu College, one of the oldest colleges of Delhi University, on Friday
 mauka tha unki nukkad naatakon ke sangrah 'sabase sasta gosht' ke vimochan kaa
 No dramatist can have a better meeting than the one he reaches
 vahaan thik vaisaa hi maahaul kaayam kar diya jaae, jaisaa wo apni kalam ke jariye safed pannon main sadhe or jajbaton se bhare lafjon ke jariye paidaa karata he
 Students of Hindu College welcomed their favorite author in the same manner and made them realize that the words written by them were not going to remain imprisoned in a book, but in front of the people through such efforts Are happening sau saal se bhi zyada puraneprakashakarajapaal and sans kii ore se yojit is kaarykram kaa samaa to vahaan ke chaatr- chaatraon ne apni sufi qawwali ke jariye pehle hi baandh diya tha
 After that, when Pragya, a professor of Kirori Mal and a former student of Hindu College, who kept a close grip on plays, started telling about the specialty of Asghar Wajahat and the merits of her plays, every Shai in the auditorium was listening to them
 khussgar vajahatne is maukey par na sirf apni pustak kaa ek ansh padhakar sunaaya balki kuch sulagate hue sawaalon ke jawaab dekar unhone har chaatr- chaatra ke man ko tatola bhi or use sahalaaya bhi
 On this occasion, one thing was noticed by the students of Hindu College, Kabilegaon, and that the German citizens were especially present to participate in this Hindi program, and the surprise increased the most when there in front of people It was revealed that the German woman is a Hindi student and is running a special campaign to spread Hindi in her country
 14 nukkad naatakon kii is pustak main asagar vajahat ne samaaj main chupe dard, vidmbana, sarokaar or siyasat ko behad kareeb se tatola he or bahut chutile andaaj main muddon ko uthaakar is baat ko jaahir karne kii koshish kii he ki samasya kaa samaadhaan kaise sarthak tareeke se nikaala ja saktaa he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi made it clear during the Karnataka elections that if his party emerges as the largest party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then he is ready to become Prime Minister
 darasal, unase ek charchaa ke dauraan piem banane ko lekar sawaal poocha gaya tha
 To this, Rahul said, "if the Congress becomes the largest party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, why won't i become the Prime Minister?" The direct fight of "narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi"? All the meanings are being extracted in the political corridors of Rahul's statement
 ab jabakiloksabhaa chunaavako ek saal kaa vakt bachaa he, aise main rahul kaa ye bayaan aanan-fanan main nahin balki sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat saamne aayaa lagata he
 In September last year, Rahul made a similar statement while visiting America
 kya ye bayaan 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ko ‘narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi’kii sidhi ladaai banane kii koshish he? darasal, vipakshi ekajutata kii baat to hoti he, lekin bijepi ke khilaaf jo vipakshi gathbandhan banegaa, uskaa netaa koun hoga, is sawaal ko lekar koi bhi vipakshi dal pattey kholane ko taiyaar nahin
 It is not yet clear whether Rahul Gandhi will accept the opposition parties as the leader of the coalition
 vipakshi dalon ko sanket de rahe rahul?is vakt tamaam vipakshi dalon kii koshish yahi he ki ve apni zyada se zyada ahmiyat dikhaaen
 Which gives the opportunity to contest more seats in the first election and more and more participation in power in the event of a coalition victory
 vaise rahul ke kareebi maanate hai ki agar congress sabase badi party hogi to gathbandhan kii surat main piem kii kursi congress ke paas hi rahegi
 So, is Rahul's statement on behalf of the Congress itself taking the initiative to signal to the opposition parties
 rahul ke ranneetikaron kii yojanadansal, rahul keranneetikaronki najar sirf unki congress adhyaksh ke taur par tajposhi tak hi simit nahin balki piem pad kii ummidavaari ke saath hi rahul ko sonia ke bajaay vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par sthapit karne kii he
 There is no sudden talk of Rahul getting ready to become Prime Minister himself
 nitish kumaar kaa gathbandhan congress or argedy ke saath tuutane ke baad hi rahul or unki team ne ruparekha taiyaar kerani shuru kar di thi
 He argues that the Congress is the largest party of the opposition and that along with Rahul being the leader of the party, he has to accept the other opposition parties as the leader of the opposition
 2019 main congress ke sabase bade dal ke taur par ubharne kii sthiti main rahul ke piem banane sambandhi bayaan kaa zikr karne par party ke varisht netaa kapil sibbal muskuraahat ke saath jawaab dete hai- kyon nahin?nitish ke rahete asamanjas main the rahulyah baat kisi se chuphi nahin he ki nitish ke saath gathbandhan main rahete rahul lagaataar asamanjas main the
 According to the close, Rahul was willing to put himself behind in the name of Nitish becoming the PM candidate from the opposition alliance
 lekin ab halaat badal chuke hai
 While Nitish has aligned with the BJP, the situation has already changed due to the leadership of many more regional parties in the hands of the next generations
 in sab ne rahul or unki team ko nai ranneeti ke saath saamne aane kaa aadhaar taiyaar kiya
 The story behind the attempt to make the voice of the opposition the main team Rahul believes that the political situation has changed across the country
 ab nitish modi ke saath hai to tamaam rajyon main bhi kshetreey dalon kii kaman ab nai peedi par he, jisase rahul lagaataar sampark bana rahe hai
 The new generation representatives do not see any problem in considering Rahul as a leader
 rahul ke kareebi rajyavar isaki charchaa bhi karte hai
 State-wise Congress, Rahul and regional leaders' chemistry in Tamil Nadu, because of DMK leader Karunanidhi's age and health constraints, has now taken over the reins of his son MK Stalin
 sutron kii maane to stallin or rahul lagaataar aapas main kai maukon par mil bhi chuke hai or bhavishya kii raajnneeti kii charchaa bhi kar chuke hai
 The division is straightforward - the Congress younger brother in Tamil Nadu and the DMK younger brother in Delhi
 biharnithish ke saath chhodane ke baad ab congress or lalu yadav kii party argedy ke bich gathbandhan swaabhaavik he or donon kii majaburi he
 Lalu gets out of the electoral battle due to Rahul's move to tear his ordinance
 ab lalu bhi apane beton ke liye raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Rahul is not avoiding the new generation of RJD
 lalu chunaav lard nahin sakate, aise main modi virodh ke naam par centre main argedy ko rahul ke peeche khadey hone se parhez nahin hoga
 At the same time, in Bihar, the Congress is following RJD just like it will continue to do so
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin tha ki america main rahul ke samvaad ke thik 1 din pehle argedy supremeo lalu yadav ne twit kiya- ‘desh kii sarkaar shantipurna tareeke se sirf congress hi chalaa sakati he or log ye ahsaas karne lage hai
 'just a few days ago, Rahul Gandhi went to meet Lalu in AIIMS, defying all political pundits
 saath hi nitish se alag raah pakad chuke netaa sharad yadav ne rahul se mulaakaat karne ke baad hi modi or nitish ke virodh kaa bidaa uthaaya tha
 Therefore, Sharad Yadav also has no problem in coming with Rahul
 jharkhandamobesh yahaan bhi halaat kuch vaise hi hai
 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Shibu Soren has handed over the command of his party to his son Hemant Soren
 hemanth ko bhi centre kii raajnneeti main rahul kii saraparasti se koi aitraaj nahin
 Something similar is also with the head of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha Babulal Marandi, now that both have become part of the opposition alliance, they have no objection to stand behind Rahul
 andhra pradeshbantwaare ke baad is dakshini rajya main congress haashiye par padi he
 Constant Congress strategists are trying to make Jaganmohan Reddy, once a part of the Congress, return to the Congress or form an alliance with the Congress
 congress ko ummid he ki agar baat bani to rajya main jagan or dilli main rahul kii baat par donon ek saath ho jaaenge
 But bringing Jagan along has so far been a pomp for the Congress
 pashchim bengalsipiem netaa seetaram yechuri or rahul gandhi haal ke dinon main ek duusare ke kaaphi kareeb aae hai
 Yechury has no problem standing with Rahul in the face of Modi opposition
 vahiin, congressi ranneetikaar kehete hai notebandi ke vakt bhi rahul or congress kii bulaai press conference main mamata banerjee ne aana sweekaar kiya tha
 That is why there will be no problem in the future also
 haalanki, congress ke saamne rajya main badi dikkat he ki ek duusare ke virdohi sipiem or trinmul congress ko ek saath manage karnaa
 Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi Party is now not of Mulayam but of Akhilesh
 saath hi akhilesh rahul kii dosti or saajha siyasat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Congress strategists say that in the current political situation, the compromise of seats for the fight for its existence and the right proposal for the future, gahega-bahay Mayawati will also fall in this court
 vaise samaajawaadee party or bispi kaa gathjod to ab zamin par dikhne bhi laga he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has to be content only with the role of the younger brother of Samajwadi Party and BSP
 maharashtramaharashtra main ensipi netaa sharad pavaar kii ahmiyat ko congress acchhee tarah samajhati he
 In the recent days, the Congress had made the Congress restless by joining the NDA, but now the situation has changed
 ranneetikaar maanate hai ki agar modi virodh or secular takaton kii majbootee ke naam par ensipi ne vipaksh kaa saath dena pasand kiya to sharad pavaar kii sehat or umr ke chalate rashtriya raajnneeti main unki beti supriya sule or rajya main unke bhattije ajit pavaar uttaradhikari honge
 In such a situation, Supriya will not have any problem with Rahul's patronage
 aavashyaktaa padane par sharad pavaar kabhi bhi sonia gandhi se raajnneetik sambhaavnaaon par charchaa kar sakate hai
 Overall, the team Rahul has now decided that after taking over the leadership of the Congress, the opposition parties will have to take the lead and become the prime ministerial candidate in 2019
 aise main vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke liye rahul ne piem kaa ummidavaar banakar apana daawa bhi thok diya
 The team between these two wants to complete Rahul Rahul slowly
 ranneeti ko zamin par utaarne kii chunautibat sidhi he ki rahul congress party ke adhyaksh ban gaye, isamen koi chunauti thi hi nahin
 There will be no challenge in this, as the Congress Party will be declared the Prime Ministerial candidate for 2019
 darasal asli chunauti to vipaksh kaa netaa banane kii he, jisko sabhi vipakshi dal maan len
 Because Team Rahul also knows that in today's era, the Congress is not alone enough to confront Modi and BJP, the opposition will have to unite
 isiilie nitish ke alag hone ke pehle tak asamanjas main dikh rahe rahul ne khulkar bhavishya siyasat kaa elaan kar diya
 Rahul and his team need to remember that it is easy to make a strategy, it is difficult to land on the ground
 saath hi vipaksh ke kunbe kaa saath jutanaa rahul ke liye aasaan nahin he, lekin asli chunauti to janata kaa saath paane kii hogi

 The CEO and MD of Vishal Sikka resigned
 sikaa ko 2014 main is jimmedaari ke liye khaas taur par chunaa gaya tha
 His resignation caused a rage not only in the veins of Infosys but in the entire IT industry
 18 agast ke shuukravaar ko share bazaaron main company ke share dhadadhad takreeban 10 fisadi gir gaye or shairdharakon kii 22,000 karod ru
 The wealth became good
 benchmark sensex 400 ankon se zyada neeche gir gaya
 Sikka complained of "misleading" him from his actions in the company and "false, baseless, malicious and persistent personal attacks" on him
 unhone murti kaa naam nahin liya lekin infosis ke board ne uske sansthaapak par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa
 The tussle between him and the iconic founder had been going on since November 2016, but this was the first time the board had openly rained the idol and accused him of bullying and forcing Sikka to resign
 is prakriya main company ko to nuksaan pahunchaa hi, uskaa korporate sushasan kaa vaada bhi taar-taar ho gaya
 On the anniversary, it was far from being able to meditate on the successes of life, the eyes of the idol were filled
 unhen ''usulon ke haq main khadey hone kii khatir galat samajhe jane, peeth main chura bhonke jane" ko lekar rote dekha gaya
 Investors continued to vent on Infosys shares on the following Monday as well and its shares fell more than five per cent on the stock exchanges, despite Infosys having announced a share buyback on Saturday itself
 aam taur par soochibaddh companiyon ke galat faislon par laal jhandi dikhaane vaali shairdharakon kii evji fermon ne bhi baraabar kii teji baratate hue infosis ke sankat ke liye murti ko hi doshi tehraaya
 Even some of the former independent directors of Infosys joined the flock and asked Murthy to stay away from the company of which he had been CEO for 21 long years
 san 2000 se 15 saal tak infosis ke swatantra diarector rahe onkaar goswami ne 22 agast ko murti ke naam ek khuli chitthee main likhaa, ''dur janaa seekhen, jaisaa ki aapane vishaal ko kaman saunpte vakt vaada kiya tha

 Many fear that the company may lose the speed that Sikka had given it in the last four years
 kuch vishleshkon ne to hairaani jaahir kii ki kya infosis ab kabhi apane gauravshaalee dinon kii taraf laut sakegi or iske 2,00,000 karmchaariyon kaa kya hoga? ye chintaaen or sarokaar hairaani kii baat nahin hai
 Infosys is not just another company, but carries a unique identity in the business
 usne tata kansaltency services, wipro or echsiel technologies sareekhee companiyon ke saath milakar bhartiya ity ko duniya bhar main misaal banaaya he
 While the flames of the previous big corporate battle between former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry have not subsided, the battle within Infosys has rocked his image and credibility as a trusted and true brand around the world
 Has posed a threat
 sikaa ke haathon main infosis kii kaman teen saal rahi, itane chote-se vakphe main murti ke liye yah naubat kyon or kaise aa gai? unhen madhyavargeey kamyaabi ke shandaar shikhar ke taur par dekha jaataa tha, jisane hajaaron oonchi tankhwaah vaali izzatdaar naukariyaan paidaa kin, shairdharakon ko arbapati banaaya or paardarshita tathaa korporate sushasan ke pratimaan kaayam kiye
 From there, today it has come to light that Murthy is being blamed for trying to destroy his own company
 kya ve badmijaaj ''bujurgavaar" ho gaye hai jo apane haathon se kaman phisalane dena nahin chaahate? kya sikaa sau tanch khare technocrate hai jinhone badlaav laane kii koshish kii or is chakkar main kai ''puraane rakhwalon" kii naaraazgi mol le lee? kya infosis kaa board vah jimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahaa he jo use bharose ke saath saunpi gai thi? kya infosis ke bheetar vittiya gadbaditon or korporate rajkaaj ko lekar gumnaam vislabloar or pramotaron ke aaropon main koi sachaai he?india today parade ke peeche gaya or usne is afsane main shaamil kai logon ke saath baat kii
 Most of them chose to remain anonymous, as some are either involved in this constantly unfolding drama but are not authorized to talk to the media or are former ex-executives of the company who are associated with one of the ranks of Murthy or Sikka
 murti ne bheje gaye mail sandeshon kaa jawaab nahin diya, vahiin infosis ne apane agxcutive ke saath milane dene se inkaar kar diya
 Nevertheless, the real story is being given here that what happened in Infosys was wrong, why is it important and what else can be revealed in the coming days
 haalanki thodaa peeche jaakar yah jaananaa jaruri he ki sikaa kyon or kaise infosis main aae
 
 
 Relationship that never existed Infosys called a hasty press conference on Thursday, June 13, 2014, at the sprawling green campus in Bangalore
 utsaah se bhare narayan murti, jo saal bhar pehle hi company ko uske girte pradarshan se ''raahat" dilaane ke makasad se apane duusare kaarykaal ke liye infi main laute the (2011 main ritair hone ke baad), ne nae siio or emdi ke taur par vishaal sikaa kii niyukti kaa elaan kiya
 "sikka" means a lot of wealth for Infosys
 " apane upnaam se khelte hue sikaa ne yah baat kahi thi, jis par murti khaase khush hue the
 This cheerfulness was also evident when both the chairman and the newly appointed CEO of the second largest IT services exporting company in India had read each other's letters
 sikaa apane kariyar ke zyaadaatar vakt america main rahe the
 First as an entrepreneur, when he created and sold two companies, and later as a successful senior executive of business software major SAP or SAP

 At that time, no one had any idea that this jubilation would happen in less than 40 months
 kamakharch diggajayah vah vakt tha jab hindustan kii ity seva niryaatak companiyaan bahut dhamaakedaar dhang se bad rahi thim
 Their exports increased from $ 5 billion in 2000 to $ 108 billion in 2014

 By that time Infosys had not only represented but led this growth
 uskaa rajasav 2000 main 51
 It increased from $ 200 million to over $ 10 billion by the end of last quarter
 rajasav ke lihaaj se infosis sabase badi company kabhi nahin thi (tisies thi)
 Nevertheless, she remained the pride and leader of the region
 jahaan tata samooh kii lambii kaarobaari viraasat rahi thi or wipro ek daulatmand kaarobaari ke bete kii rahanumai main badi thi, vahiin infosis kii kahani buniyadi taur par saat madhyavargeey naujavaanon kii kahani thi, jinhone niyam-kaayadon or usulon ke mutabik chalate hue duniya bhar main naam or dhan kamaaya (murti ne patni sudhaa se 10,000 ru
 Started the company with a loan
 yah kissa ab korporate lokgatha kaa hissaa he)
 In the post-1991 open-economy India, that story of promotion, not of "recommendation" but of ability, was a great attraction
 yah bahut khubi or ehtiyaat se rachaa gaya afasana bhi tha, jisamen iske kaamyaab sansthaapak kamakharchi se kaam lete the, apane madhyavargeey mulyon se ab bhi jude the or daulat ko samtawadi tareeke se baantne ke liye taiyaar the
 Infosys set the pattern for financial transparency
 usne hisaab-kitaab kii jieepi paddati, global delivery model (jidiem) yaa eesopi (karmchaariyon ko share kaa vikalp dene kii yojana) ke jariye sampada main saajhedaari sareekhe nae maanak kaayam kar industry kii aguai kii
 Infosys became a national institution
 haalanki promotaron ne baari-baari se company kaa sheersh ohada sanbhaalane kaa faisla kiya tha, par udyog badlaav se guzar rahaa tha or pravaas kii ''lift and shift" ranneeti or ''lebar arbitrege" yani naukariyon ke sasti laagat vaale deshon main jane ke daur se aage aa chukaa tha
 This meant that like other Indian companies in the IT sector, Infosys was also beginning to be affected by the economic slowdown
 mandi ke is daur main infosis kii aguai ke liye lautakar aae murti ko is baat kaa shrey diya janaa chahie ki unhone jaldi hi yah samaj liya ki udyog main kayapalat ho chukaa he or company ko vruddhi ke agle daur main le jane ke liye use nae, yuva or josh se bhare haathon kii jarurat he
 The coin was thus introduced (although there was considerable pressure from shareholders as Murthy's second term led to a flood of exodus of high-ranking executives)
 us vakt kuch vishleshkon ne sikaa kii kaabiliyat ko lekar sawaal bhi uthaae the, yah dekhte hue ki unhen ity seva udyog kii koi malumat nahin thi or ve software kii duniya ke aadmi zyada the, jo bilkul alahada cheez thi
 Method of Coin 90% of Infosys employees lived and worked in India, despite the ambition of being a global company
 sikaa kii paidaaish to hindustan main hui thi, par unhone apni balig or peshewar jindagi kaa zyaadaatar vakt america main guzaara tha
 They were cut off from the strong culture, systems and processes that Infosys had built and developed over the years with precaution
 yahi nahin, unhone hindustan kii bajaae america main rahane or vahaan se kaamkaaj chalaane kaa faisla karke company kii dhuree ko hi badal diya, jisase company ke bheetar khaasi bechaini paidaa hui
 Murthy and Infosys initially defended the selection of Sikka as CEO, stating that this was the way to go, and as a technocrat with his credibility and warm, affable, cheerful personality, he is the face to lead the company
 sikaa company kaa cheharaa jarur ban gaye, par graahakon, vishleshkon, sarkaar or media ke liye infosis—jise hameshaa se parade ke peeche kaam karwaane kaa shandaar hunar hasil thakriko ab bhi praveen raav chalaa rahe the, jo teen dashak se company se jude the

 In fact, the dominance of the promoters and especially Murthy was more due to his moral standing and prestige given him his real shareholding (murthy had only Infosys 0)

 Known for his temperament and handling things closely, Murthy vowed that he would stay away from the company's decisions and let the new CEO move in the direction the company wanted

 infosis ne sanghatit vruddhi ko bhi tarjeeh di, jisamen murti rajasav kii bajaae munafa badhaane ko ahmiyat dete the
 This meant that his profits were the highest
 apane shikhar par infosis ko 30 fisadi khalis munafa hasil hota tha, jo essenture or ibm sareekhee uski vaishvik saathi companiyon se doguna se bhi zyada or uske hindustani pratispardhiyon se kahin ooncha tha, jabaki unka laagat kaa dhaancha ek samaan tha
 This shows that she used to take only high-profit jobs and worked better
 isko maanate hue bazaaron ne inphi ke sheyaron par uski saathi companiyon se zyada premium die
 Therefore, the company used to take a lot of precaution regarding such acquisitions which could reduce its profits
 2008 main jab unhone britain sthit package implementation company ekson ke liye boli lagaai or echsiech tech javaabi boli ke saath achaanak bich main kud padi, to inphi ne keemat or munaafe ke sambhavit muddon kaa hawala dekar apni boli badhaane se inkaar kar diya or sauda ganvaa baithi

 Badlasikka's tenure on suspicion over the Panaya deal was just six months after Infosys announced in February 2015 it would acquire Panaya, an Israeli technology provider of automation technology, as part of its "new and then new" strategy
 infosis ne kabhi khulaasa nahin kiya ki usne panaaya ke liye kitni rakam adaa kii, par bazaar vishleshkon ne 20 karod dollar se 23 karod dollar ke bich bhugtan kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Interestingly, Panaya had some venture capital from Haso Plattner, a billionaire founder of SAP and a former mentor of Sikka, with whom Sikka's excellent relationship continued even after his departure from the company
 panaaya ko jis oonche daam main kharida gaya, use lekar bazaar ke kuch halkon main hairaani thi

 Murthy and the promoters, using this mail, openly blamed Infosys for corporate governance and demanded an inquiry
 aarope-pratyaropashuruyaat main board ne pratirodh kiya or pehle aaropon kii padtaal ke liye siril amarchand mangaladas kii niyukti kar di
 This law firm gave a clean chit to Sikka and the board
 jab promotor isse santusht nahin hue to global lau form gibson dan and krachar elelpi se jaanch karne ke liye kaha gaya
 He too gave a clean chit to Sikka
 murti ne in clin chiton par yun pratikriya jaahir kiah ''
 
 
 Shareholders who have read the whistleblower report have told me that it is difficult to trust the report prepared by some of the lawyers appointed by some of the accused in which the same accused have been given a clean chit and the same accused refused to disclose Have given why clean chit is given! 
 
 yah nishpaksh or vastuparak jaanch karwaane kaa tarika nahin he
 "in a letter to the board of Infosys in July, he had raised eight questions, most of which were about the Panaya deal and executive payments and sought his clarification from the board
 unki ek pramukh maang yah thi ki lau fermon kii puri jaanch ko saarvajanik kiya jaae
 Murthy made the letter public after Sikka's resignation
 ve venkatesan kii unhen bheji us chitthee se bhi naaraaz the jisamen kaha gaya tha ki board ne panaaya maamle ko ''band kar diya" he
 It also did not help that the Panaya acquisition did not succeed
 haalanki kuch bahari vishleshkon ke is akalan se company sahamat nahin he
 "such is the nature of the acquisitions," says an Infosys executive who is sympathetic to the coin
 kuch kaamyaab hote hai, kuch nahin hote
 What happened to the acquisition of $ 350 million Loadstone? The company was acquired when a promoter was the CEO
 "sheshsai ne ghoose ke aaropon ko bakawaas bataaya or keemat tay karne ke tareekon kaa bachaav kiya
 He said that the entire investigation was done with that company's precaution from external and company filters
 press conference main sheshsai ne kaha, ''kai swatantra jaanchon main kaha gaya he ki aisi (ghoose jaisi) koi cheez nahin thi
 "seshasayee also defended the payment made to Bansal, saying that" it was a wrong decision and taken only because of his long service in the company
 " promotaron ko yah daleel raas nahin ai
 Murthy kept talking to the media and expressed his unhappiness over the methods of running Infosys
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki unhen salaah di gai thi ki sikaa mahaj sitio banane laayak the
 Continuing criticism and internal fighting, the coin was battered and eventually resigned
 infosis ke staff ko bheje ek mail main unhone kaha, ''yah saaf he ki pichley teen saal main hamaari kamyaabiyon or hamaare boe gaye taqatvar bijon ke baavjood main siio ke taur par kaam nahin kar saktaa or na hi puunji nirmaan jari rakh saktaa hum

 Stung by the divided board, interim CEO and forced to resign, it will be difficult for Infosys to continue the growth of industry-leading growth

 unhone kaha ki lambey vakt main infosis ko aisa tantra bananaa hoga jo prabandhan ko ''bahari shor-sharabe" se bachaa sake
 Questions are being raised about the limits of promoters and also in the interests of them and small shareholders

 After the result, the biggest problem for the students of class 10th is, which stream should they take in class 11th
 kai chaatro ko samaj nahin aata he unke liye kaunsi stream best he
 If you too have this confusion then here we are telling what things should be kept in mind while taking the science, commerce and arts stream
 kya bananaa chaahate hai aap-apane dimag main sabase pehle ye set kar len ki aapkaa interest kis vishay main he
 What do you want to be in the future
 us hisaab se arts, commers yaa science stream kaa chunaav karen
 CBSE 10th result declared, 86
 7 % student paas, ladakiyon ne phir maari baziarts main future nahin he-aksar zyaadaatar chaatr sochate hai ki commers or science main aage kaaphi scope he lekin arts main nahin he
 If you think the same, then tell me this is not the case at all
 aap stream chaahe koi bhi len, future har stream main he
 So to achieve your goal, which topic would be better to read, talk to your teachers or friends
 counslar se karen baat-agar aapako kuch bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he to aap kariyar counslar kii madad le sakate hai
 Decide by talking to them which stream is best for your future
 CBSE: 10veen- 12veen ke liye re-evaluation prakriya shuru, aise karen applijosh main naa len koi stream-aisa aksar hota he ki ham apane doston or parivaar ko dikhaane ke liye josh main science or commers le baithte hai
 But later on you realize that you are not doing well in it
 isliye baad main pachhataane se acha he pehle hi sanbhal kar stream chune
 Do not care about people - if 90% marks are in your 10th and you can easily get science and commerce stream, but your interest is in arts, then choose arts stream regardless of people
 kyonki aap jaanate hai jitna behatar aap arts main kar paaenge utana science or commers stream main nahin kar paaenge
 The Supreme Court has ruled out such a plea that demanded that the boys be married at 18 years of age

 This petition said that the right to vote in the country is attained at the age of 18 years
 vahiin, sena main bhartee ke liye bhi nunatam umr seemaa 18 saal hi he
 In such a situation, the age of marriage should be reduced from 21 to the same

 When the court heard the petition on Monday, it was dismissed outright
 court ne yachika ko nakaarte hue spasht kaha ki agar 18 saal kaa koi ladkaa is yachika ke saath aata he, to tab ham ise dekhenge
 The court not only dismissed the petition, but also expressed displeasure over the lawyer who filed it
 iske liye court ne baqayada yachikakarta par arthdand bhi laga diya
 The court has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the petitioner

 In this research conducted at the University of Montreal, the researchers said that the basic purpose of this research was to set standards in sexual fantasies
 mana jaataa he ki sexual phantasy ko sex ke liye behad jaruri hota he or aisi phantasy kii vajah se sex main ruchi bhi bani rahati he or partner ko dard bhi kam hota he

 Considering the vote bank, Congress is organizing conferences of various castes
 aise main bijepi bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chaahati
 Both have announced caste conventions for tribals, scheduled castes and backward classes and have started implementing it

 After Adivasis, this society has the highest number of voters
 lihaaja is samudaay ke votaron ko lubhaane ke liye party jatigat sammelan yojit kar unki har samasya ko sulajhane kaa vaada kar rahi he
 The biggest problem of this community is about reservation
 haal hi main rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne anusuchit jati ko mil rahe 16 fisadi aarakshan ko ghataakar 12 fisadi kar diya
 Therefore, Congress has got the opportunity to do this in favor of the voters of this community
 yah baat bijepi ko khal rahi he
 However, BJP is also not behind in organizing caste conferences
 philhal isane band kamaron main baithkon par jor diya he
 In the constituencies, BJP will organize caste convention from September 15
 bijepi anusuchit jati morcha ke adhyaksh raamji bharti ne bataaya ki 3, 4 or 5 aktubar ko bijepi anusuchit jati yatra karegi
 Keeping in mind the caste equation, the BJP has appointed cell officials
 vahiin pradesh congress adhyaksh charan das mahant in sammelnon main vot bank kii raajnneeti se inkaar karte hai
 He says, "mini Mata has served the area as a Member of Parliament
" '' har varg unhen aadar kii drushti se dekhtaa he
 Hence the conference was held in his name
 mahant kaa aarope he ki bijepi baukhalaakar congress ke sammelnon par ungali uthaa rahi he
 The game of caste politics continues in Bastar as well
 congress ne adivaasiyon se sambandhit muddon ke alaava anusuchit jati ke aarakshan main katautee kiye jane kaa mudda uchhaala he to pichhadaa varg ko saadhane ke liye is varg ke liye aarakshan badaye jane kaa samarthan kiya he

 On the other hand, whenever the light flashed in the sky, there would be a noise on the ground below

 Actually, this light of light in the sky is nothing but those rockets loaded with gunpowder which are being fired on the residential areas of Gaza
 ye rocket insaani bastiyon par or koi nahin balki israel daag rahaa he
 Manzar is some four years old
 thik vaisaa hi he jab israel or philistin ke bich ghamaasan jang chal rahi thi
 On August 9, at 3 in the afternoon, Gazarat had caused its destruction

 The night rocket fell on the settlements in the face of doom, then in the day, the fighter aircraft F16 fighter jets became death wreaking havoc
 gaaza ke aasmaan se kuch ghanton ke andar hi phir se maut barasaai ja rahi thi
 This time the attack was more frightening
 aasmaan se barasate bam ek-ek kar oonchi-oonchi or badi-badi rihaishi imaaraton ko zamindos kar rahe the
 This is the reason for the attack
 The attack continued for the last two days

 After this, Israel started retaliating

 Palestine says that a girl and a pregnant woman have died in this attack in addition to a person associated with Hamas
 jabaki barbaadi kii tasviren kuch or hi kahani bayaan kar rahi hai
 In a video shot on a street in the middle of the city, it appears that a multi-story building is seen at the end of the road and then the building suddenly gets attacked by Israeli fighter jets from the sky and the whole thing The building becomes like a ground, as if there was a strong earthquake in the area
 israel ne hamaas ko tehraaya jimmedaarmauke kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue ab sanyukt raashtra sangh ne donon pakshon se sabar se kaam lene kii apil kii he

 The influx of injured city dwellers in the hospital is increasing
 haalanki israel ne in hamalon ke liye aatankwaadi sanghathan hamaas ko zimmedaar tehraaya he
 Israel says that if Hamas had not attacked it with a rocket, the situation might not have been so bad
