 pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa aatanki mishan ke dauraan kodeward kaa istemaal karte hai
 Yes, those jumle with the help of which terrorists make blue prints of nefarious intrigues with their recruits
 yadi kisi ne unki baatcheet sun bhi lee to wo samaj nahin saktaa
 Because decoding their code is not difficult at all
 aatank kaa kaarobaar kodeward se hi chalata he
 In a clip present with Aaj Tak, the sit-ins commander in Pakistan got a call from Lashkar to Delhi
 lashkar kaa rangarut pragati maidan main maujuud tha
 In the black business of terror, its masters have maintained a complete dictionary
 jo hamaare or aapke jaise saamaanya shaks nahin samaj saktaa
 Suits found in the world of terror means whether Reiki's photos were found
 aam bhejo kaa matlab hota he hathiyaar bhejo
 American girl means IED explosive
 dana kaa matlab hota he hathiyaar
 Potato means grenade
 raajma kaa matlab hota he kaartoos
 In the language of terror, small cargo means pistol and big cargo is an assault rifle
 isi tarah aatank ke aakaa apane rangaruton se baat karne ke liye padhaa likhaa istemaal karte hai, jiskaa matlab hota haiaatanki training
 To take a bail is to go and take a weapon
 kaagaj vaale kaam kaa matlab hota he hawala ke jariye paise
 In this way, talking in codeword, terrorists carry out the incident
 pakistan main baithkar aatank ke aakaa aatankiyon ko sirf nirdesh hi nahin dete balki aatank ke rangaruton kii pahchaan or puri tasalli bhi phone or email ke jariye hi karte hai
 Mobile phones have become a major weapon in this business
 aatank kii sajeesh se lekar napak hamalon ko anjaam dene kaa kaam phone par hi hota he
 The leader of terror also identifies his recruits on the phone
 unke dimag main jehar bhi phone se bharta he
 The game of terror has become hi-tech
 mobile or sim se lekar i-mail idi tak
 Those mentors also need a live mail address
 lekin ek baat tay he kiatank ke akaapane rangaruton ko aatank ke mishan main tab tak nahin lagaate jab tak puri tasalli nahin kar lete
 When recruits are put on a mission of terror, the bosses keep a close watch on them, whether in the valley or Delhi
 ajtak ke paas maujuud ek clip main pakistan main baithelshkar commanderne lashkar ke rangarut ko dilli tak phone mila diya
 Lashkar's rookie was present in Pragati Maidan
 unki baatcheet se saaf pataa chalaa ki vah kisi khaas khaas kaam main laga hua tha
 Although this conversation between the terrorists and the terrorists is a bit old, but the style is the same today
 aatank ke khel main mobile kaa dhadlle se istemaal ho rahaa he

 About two and a half thousand years ago, Adi strategist Kautilya of ancient India explained in his "arthashastra" how to deal with enemy countries

 under-19 cricket main kualalampur main bharat ko vishwacap dilwane vaale kohli ne mirpur (bangladesh) se or baad main dilli main apane ghar se die ek intervyuu main india today ke dipti editor shantnu guha re ko bataaya ki jab bhi ve ballebaaji karne jate hai, apni pari ko 30, 60 or 100 ke teen hisson main baant lete hai
 In this way, they either make a half-century or reach a century
 yah bhi ki up-captain kaa ohada unke liye jindagi se bhi badhkar he
 Both your centuries went in vain as India could not make it to the finals
 dekhie, england, australia or dhaka main mili paraajayon se bahut zyada arth nikaalane kii koshish mat kiijie
 If there are bad times, some good, memorable moments have also come
 pichley ek saal main hamane kaaphi cricket kheli he
 Played good matches in Dhaka, yet unfortunately did not reach the final
 aisa har team ke saath hota he
 It is only by losing that we learn to win
 team ne un paraajayon ko ab dhire-dhire jeet main badalanaa shuru kar diya he
 What was going on in your mind when Pakistan lost a wicket without scoring a huge goal? No cricket team in the world depends on one or two players
 jeetne ke liye puri team ko khelnaa hota he
 The Indian cricket team is full of great players
 bina kisi ran ke wicket kho dene se turant ek dabaav to ban hi jaataa he, lekin match ke dauraan kisi bhi maukey par bharat ne khud ko kahin bhi kamjor nahin padane diya
 Pakistan had given a big target, but we also followed it in our own way and won
 lekin gendbaaj beasar rahe
 If you have looked at the pitch, you must have understood that it was a batsmen's paradise
 outfield khaasi tej thi or gendbaajon ke liye kisi bhi team ko 250-270 se neeche roak paanaa bahut mushkil tha
 And the same pitch helped you and other batsmen a lot
 haa, yahaan main kaamyaab rahaa hum
 i have scored two centuries here and two in the Asia Cup this time
 yah bhartiya upmahadweep kii duusari pichon kii hi tarah he jahaan outfield tej hota he
 The batsmen are always batting here
 jaankaron ne aapke pradarshan ko 1983 ke vishwacap main kapil dev ke zimbabwe ke khilaaf banaae 175 ranon se upar aanka he
 That innings of Kapil Dev helped the Indian team in the race for the World Cup and finally they won the cup
 kisi daur main bharat-pakistan ke match bade hi uttejk hua karte the, kya ab bhi utana hi tanaav hota he?kuch match to vaaki bade hi uttejnaa vaale rahe, khaskar vishwacap main khele jane vaale
 Take the semi-finals played in Mohali during the last World Cup, it was also very tense
 abhi vaala match to hamaare liye is vajah se khaas tha kyonki hamen cap kii daud main bane rahane ke liye ise jeetna hi tha
 We had lost to Bangladesh
 aap apni bhaawanaaon kaa saarvajanik taur par aisa pradarshan kyon karte hai? kya yah aapaki puraani style he?dekhie, yah koi gaali-galouj nahin he
 This is one of my ways of taking out the charge inside
 main khilaadiyon ko gaali nahin baktaa, khud se baat karata hum, khud ko gaali detaa hum
 i keep telling myself constantly: improve, do better than last match, play better shot than previous shot
 tum aisa kar sakate ho
 Not always, but yes, after every century i have been adopting this process on myself
 andar kaa aavesh nikalne kii koi vajah bhi to honi chahie naa
 Don't you think that cricket has now become One Day and T20? No, i think it's not true
 isisi kii ore se tay kiya gaya test maichon kaa kota ham aaj bhi khelkar puraa karte hai
 But the crowd does not gather in Tests
 kya kahenge?dekhie, ye to bheed kii dikkat he naa
 What is the fault of the game and the players in this? You will be happy if you become the vice-captain, but this post also creates pressure
 aapkaa balla nahin chamakaa to yah ohada chhin bhi saktaa he, yaa nahin?maine acha nahin khelaa to phir to team se hi baahar ho jaaoongaa
 It is not that after winning, i should stop speaking to him
 under-19 kaa vishwacap jeetne ke baad mujhmen aae badlaav ko sabane dekha he
 i could not even read the newspaper after winning the match with Pakistan, in which hundreds of titles were added in front of my name
 main bhartiya team kii vardi or up-captain ke ohade kii ahmiyat bahut acchhee tarah samajhataa hum
 How did you change the way you started playing openly on the off side, you will tell me that my focus was always on the left side
 dhire-dhire yah meri aadat or kamajori banataa ja rahaa tha
 My coach wanted me to work on the shots on the right side of the wicket
 leg said par khilne kii meri kaabiliyat or timming ko lekar ve pehle se aashwast the
 i worked hard and perfected my defensive technique
 mujhe is baat kii khushi he ki ab main wicket ke sabhi ore khelkar ran bana paa rahaa hum or bade paimaane par boundrij hasil kar rahaa hum
 Nobody calls me a Leggie Batsman
 or aap hameshaa lakshya kaa peechha karne main majaa lete hai, dabaav kaa anand lete hai
 See, i do not steal my mouth from pressure situations
 haal ke kuch maichon main maine bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue vishaal score khadaa kiya he
 Now it has been fixed main shuru main apane liye ek behatar plateform taiyaar karata hum, jisase ki team kii madad ke liye zyada ran bator sakuun
 You are now being called the world's best ODI cricketer
 lekin agar main acha nahin kheloongaa to duniya ke sabase bure vanade khilaadi kaa tamgaa milane main bhi der nahin lagegi
 How important cricket is to you will be told with honesty
 ye to meri jindagi he
 This is all for me
 cricket kii vajah se hi maine pita kii antyeshti der se karwaai
 The edicts from the seniors have helped me prepare as a seasoned batsman in the middle order and i could retain my place in the team
 dhoni se aapane kya sabak siikhaa?wicket par bane raho, ran banaao or team ko behatar sthiti main pahunchane main madad karo
 He has taught that never get in a hurry to score fast as soon as you get on the field
 unheen se siikhaa ki mujhe apana wicket yun hi koi ooljulul shot khelkar nahin ganvaana chahie
 What advice do you take from seniors? And yes, recently you wrote a very personal letter to Sachin
 maine unase apane mushkil ke daur main rasta sujhane ke liye chitthee likhi thi
 i grew up watching them, today i play with them
 ve bahut kaam kii salaah dete hai
 You know, cricket is a pressure game in India
 lekin cricketer kamaate bhi to khub hai, khel se bhi or vigyapanon se bhi
 If you look at the career of a cricketer, you will find that it is very short
 aise main unhen yah jo kuch miltaa he, vah koi bahut zyada yaa ajooba paidaa karne vaala nahin hota
 Everyone wants to win in India
 koi bhi haarana nahin chahta
 In such a situation, the cricketer has to bear all the pressure

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko karnataka ke kolar main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 In Bangarpet rally, the Prime Minister said that the Congress government has not met the expectations of the people
 modi ne kaha ki ye chunaav karnataka ke aane vaale paanch saal kaa bhavishya tay karegaa
 Let me tell you that now there is only 48 hours left to stop the election campaign in Karnataka
 rahul ke piem banane ke bayaan par modi kaa palatwarpradhanmantri ne rahul gandhi ke piem pad ko lekar die gayi bayaan par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that Rahul's statement shows the ego of Namdar
 koi kaise apane aap ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar saktaa he
 PM Modi said that the names of the Congress are born with a spoon of gold and this gold is also foreign
 modi bole ki inako garibi kaa pataa nahin he, jab hamane shauchalay banaae to unhone kaha ki modi amiron ke liye kaam karata he
 He said that this statement of the Congress leader exposes the internal democracy of the Congress
 unhone kaha ki modi ko hataane ke liye gathbandhan kii meeting chal rahi he, bade-bade diggajon ke pair pakade ja rahe hai
 Keeping all these veterans in the dark and declaring themselves PM is mistrust in the coalition itself
 unhone kaha ki namdaar ko gathbandhan ke saathi netaaon par bharosa naa ho, jiskaa ahankaar saatven aasmaan par pahunchaa ho aise ap 'immature namdaar' ko kya desh kii janata sweekaar karegi
 Yesterday someone made an important declaration- he said, "I am going to be PM!" He came like those bullies, barging his way ahead when there are others who have many years of experience
 How can someone just declare himself as the PM? This is simply nothing but arrogance : PM— BJP (@bjp4india)may 9, 2018ginai congress kii 6 bimaariyampradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress ne karnataka kii izzat ko mitti main mila diya he
 The people of the country are getting to know about the exploits of the Congress, so the Congress is being given farewell from all over the country
 ab congress ko karnataka se vidaa karne kii baari he
 During this period, the Prime Minister attacked the Congress and counted 6 diseases of the Congress and called them 6-C
 modi ne ginai congress kii 6 bimaariyaan
 
 
 # Congress culture # Communalism # Jacism # Crime # Corruption # Contractor system (contractor) The Prime Minister said during this time that the Congress is becoming clear from all the states where elections are being held across the country
 ab karnataka se bhi congress saaf ho jaaegi
 He said that people are very angry with Congress
 PM modi ne raily main kaha ki karnataka hindustan kii aan-baan-shaan he
 He said that there was only one Prime Minister in the UPA government and he had a remote control
 lekin hamaari sarkaar main remote control or haikaman desh ke 125 karod log hai
 There are the six evils that the Congress has brought on the nation - Congress culture - Communalism, Casteism, Crime, Corruption, Contractor system: PM Modi # bjp4betterkarnataka- BJP (@ bjp4india) May 9, 2018 PM Modi addressing the rally said When the Congress comes into government, it believes that the public has given them a contract to commit corruption
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag rajyon main congress ke darbari baithe hue hai, inkaa kaam he dilli ke namadaaron ke saamne sir jhukaa kar rahanaa or unka jai-jayakaar karnaa
 The Prime Minister said that even after four years, the Congress is not able to accept its defeat, the Congress is not allowing Parliament to run and the flag of democracy is being blown
 unhone kaha ki naa hi congress dil vaali he, naa daliton vaali he ye congress sirf deal vaali he
 This is the real act of the Congress
 ye deal vaali baat modi nahin balki congress ke saansad virappa moili ne kahi he
 He said that Veerappa Moily is a big leader and also the royal courtier of Delhi Durbar
 unhone kaha ki congress ne 5 saal tak kai tarah ke khel khele hai, is dauraan paisa bhi mila or benami sampatti bhi mili
 The Prime Minister said that the Congress party is an expert in lying and lie anything
 unhone kaha ki abhi unhone jhooth chalaaya ki modi sarkaar SC / ST kanoon ko kamjor kar rahi he, lekin sach to ye he ki modi sarkaar ne is kanoon ko majboot kiya he

 The Northern Municipal Corporation of Delhi, which is facing a shortage of funds, has now found a new way to deal with the shortage of medicines in its hospitals
 north emsidi ab bhagwaan ke bharose apane aspataalon main dawaaon kaa intjaam karne ja rahi he
 According to Jayaprakash, chairman of the Standing Committee at North MCD, the stock of essential medicines in the municipal hospitals is almost exhausted, so the municipal corporation has talked to several religious institutions
 in dharmik sansthaaon se nagar nigam ne donneton ke taur par davaaiyaan maangi he
 Jai Prakash told "we are in touch with a dozen religious institutions, we have also issued our helpline numbers, currently five organizations have agreed to help us, we have given them the list of essential medicines
" agle ek hafte main dawaaen aani shuru ho jaaengi
 Apart from this, we have also sought help from a dozen ngos
 "nagar nigam in sansthaaon ko jaruri dawaaon kii list saunpane ja rahi he jinamein pramukh rup se jaruri vaxin, dengue, malaria or chikangunia ke ilaaj ke dauraan istemaal hone vaali poorak dawaaen shaamil hai
 There is also a shortage of kits used for blood tests in municipal hospitals
 jin dharmik sansthaaon ne uttari nagar nigam ko dawaaen dene par sahmati jataai hai unamem sanathan cheritable santhaan, janamanas trust, aasthaa dharm sanstha, nirankaari sanstha shaamil he
 Let us tell you that due to lack of funds in all the hospitals of North MCD, the stock of essential medicines is in the last round
 beete dinon north emsidi kii kamisionar varsha joshi ne twit karke dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar par north emsidi kaa health fund relies na karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Varsha Joshi had said that the Health Fund account is completely empty at this time
 nigam jaise-taise doctors kii selary de paa rahe hai, lekin hospital main dawaaon ke stock menkami aa gai he
 Additional MS Dr Vibha of Hindu Rao Hospital says that now when we issue orders to buy medicines, due to lack of funds, we have to choose which medicines to buy and which not to buy

 bajet 2018-19 sansad main pesh karne se judi antim daur kii taiyaariyon mencendre sarkarjuti hui he
 Meanwhile, India Today's mood survey of the country has arrived
 visheshgyon main isapar sahmati dikhti he ki isbajet main krishior gramin kshetron kii badahaali, aadharbhoot dhaanche ke nirmaan or rojgaar sankat jaisi samasyaon se nibatane par vishesh jor hoga
 The mood survey of the country also gauged the general opinion being made in the country on the crisis like unemployment, inflation and corruption
 surveykshan main hissaa lene vaale 32 fisadi logon ne berogari or naukari ganvaane kii ashanka jaise muddon par gahari chintaa jaahir kii
 Data from government agencies released some time ago also point to this
 may 2017 main, lebar beuro ne rojgaar par timahi report jari karte hue kaha tha ki april, 2016 se disambar, 2016 ke bich rojgaar srijan ke aath pramukh kshetron main sirf 2
 3 lakh jobs were created
 yah aankada pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 2014 main har saal ek karod naukariyon ke intjaam ke chunavi vaade se kaaphi peeche he
 Some argue that the Labor Bureau is not able to produce accurate employment figures because it neither covers all sectors nor counts the employment opportunities created in the informal sector
 baharhaal, yah bhi sach he ki notebandi ke kaaran anaupchaarik kshetra main vyapak paimaane par logon kii naukariyaan gai hai or ve naukariyaan phir se srujit kii ja sakin, is baat ko sabit karne ke liye paryaapt aankade uplabdh nahin hai
 a report released in July last year by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) says that between January and April 2017, about 1
5 million jobs have been lost
 crisil ke mukhya arthshaastri dharmakirti joshi kehete hai, ''nirmaan kaary jaise rojgaar aadhaarit kshetron, chamada, kapadaa or ratna evam aabhushan jaise shram aadhaarit niryaat kshetron ko khaastaur par badhaava dene se hi nai naukariyon kaa bade paimaane par srijan sambhav ho sakegaa
 "before presenting the budget, the Finance Minister is giving such indications that this time there will be special emphasis on the creation of jobs in the schemes
" phir bhi, is surveykshan main hissaa lene vaale 53 fisadi logon ne mana ki rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne kii disha main jitna prayaas hona chahie, utana is sarkaar ne nahin kiya
 58 percent of the people are of the opinion that during the last three and a half years of the Modi government, the employment situation has gone from bad to worse
 july 2017 main hue surveykshan main rojgaar srijan ke morche par 53 fisadi log sarkaar ke bare main aisi raay rakhte the
 In the last six months, such an opinion has increased by five per cent towards the government
 pehle kii hi tarah, purvottar ke rajya or 18 se 24 saal ke aayu varg ke yuva, rojgaar ke avasaron ko lekar zyada chintit dikh rahe hai
 Four states in the Northeast are going to elections in 2018, so the Northeast is also likely to get importance in the government's development agenda
 vishesh rup se, aasmaan chooti mahangaai zyaadaatar logon ke liye chintaa kaa sabab ban rahi he
 In January 2017, in the mood survey of the country, where 10 percent people had expressed concern about inflation, in this new survey, 23 percent people were worried about it
 desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main baadh or sookhe ne fasalon ko ek jaisaa nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 This has led to a reduction in yields and an increase in prices
 vahiin sarkaar jamaakhoron se nibatane main naakaam rahi he
 a raid by the Income Tax Department at the major exporters of onions in Nashik district showed how traders were making big money by exporting onions
 isse desh main pyaaj kii killat paidaa ho rahi thi or pyaaj ke daam betahasha bade
 Crude oil prices rose significantly in the international market and reached $ 70 per barrel as compared to $ 60 a barrel a year earlier

 An estimated 6 this year against a 1 percent growth rate
 5 fisadi vikaas dar ne aarthik morche par manmohan sarkaar ke mukaable modi sarkaar ke pradarshan kii tulana shuru kii
 It was natural for people to change their opinion
 jahaan july 2017 main 59 fisadi log maanate the ki aarthik morche par modi sarkaar ne manmohan sarkaar se behatar kaam kiya he vahiin aaj yah aankada ghatakar 56 fisadi ho gaya he
 a year ago, 60 percent of the people on the economic front considered the work of the Modi government better than the Manmohan government
 vahiin 21 fisadi logon kaa aisa maananaa he ki aarthik morche par modi sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj upie kii pichhali sarkaar ke mukaable bahut kharaab he
 This is by far the highest negative survey score among the last five surveys
 modi sarkaar ke liye raahat kii bhi thodi gunjaaish dikh jaati he
 The government is not hopeful and feels that it will manage the economy
 yah baat is tathy se bhi jaahir hoti he ki surveykshan main shaamil 46 fisadi uttardaataaon ne mana ki unke aarthik str main sudhaar hua he
 In the previous survey, 44 per cent believed to be so
 vaise ek saal pehle aisa maanane vaale logon kaa aankada isse kahin adhik (53 fisadi) tha
 The Goods and Services Tax, which came into effect from July 2017, was another major issue
 aam bhaavana to aisi hi he ki jiesti aarthik sudhaaron kii disha main ek bada kadam he or isse desh kii maujuuda pechida karadhaan vyavastha saral ho jaaegi, haalanki isko lagu karne ke tareeke par bahut se logon ko aapatti bhi he
 There has been a spate of complaints related to the classification of goods in various GST slabs and technical bottlenecks coming in the GST portal
 surveykshan main shaamil kul logon main se kareeb aadhe (49 fisadi) kaa maananaa he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad se aavashyak vastuon or electronic upkarnon ke daam bad gaye hai
 Just before the Gujarat elections, the government made the biggest change related to GST in fear of losing the support of large business class of the state
 200 se adhik vastuon par tex daron main kami kii gai or rosemara istemaal kii kareeb 178 vasteen 28 fisadi vaale oonche jiesti slab se nikalakar 18 fisadi tex dar vaale slab main shaamil ho gayi jabaki sabhi prakaar ke restaraan par lagane vaale kar ko ghataakar 5 fisadi kar diya gaya
 Another step has been the GST Council's proposal to cut the tax rates on various items including old cars and biodiesel
 notebandi kaa pechnotbandi ke faisle se anaupchaarik kshetra kii naukariyon par ai aanch kaa asar ab bhi puri tarah tham nahin paaya he
 37 per cent of the people surveyed believe that black money returned to the market again under the guise of new currency
 desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan se ek or baat saamne ai ki aam janata ab bhi bhrashtachar ko badi samasya maanati he
 78 per cent believed that the Modi government has failed to reduce the kind of corruption they faced on a daily basis
 sudhaaron par baat karen to kaaphi log saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ke nijeekaran ke paksh main hai
 The activities of public sector banks have been knocking people over due to large scale bad accounts (npas)
 45 fisadi logon ne kaha ki saarvajanik bainkon kaa nijeekaran swaagatyogy kadam hoga
 As such, far-reaching reforms such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code have been implemented and 2
 11 lakh karod ru
 Despite the bank recapitalization scheme being implemented, the crisis in its banking sector will continue for some time
 niztaa kii chintabank khaaton or mobile number ko aadhaar se jodpha modi sarkaar ke mukhya prayaason main se ek rahaa he
 But people are very angry about it
 surveykshan main se 47 fisadi log bank khaaton or mobile number ko aadhaar ke saath link karne ke kadam se khush nahin dikhe
 People believe that the public is not going to benefit from this
 sabase zyada aapatti behad aam sevaaon ke liye bhi biomitric pahchaan ko jaruri banaae jane or jaankariyon kii gopneeyata se judi najar ai
 The government is full of concerns and there is little time to deal with it
 desh is baat par nazren gadaaye rakhega ki sarkaar 2019 ke aam chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apni praathamiktaaon kaa nirdhaaran kaise karti he
 The top-level security clearance of US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior aide Jared Kushner has been revoked
 maamle se jude vishwasaneey sutron ne isaki pushti kii he
 This decision to revoke Kushner's security clearance would have a profound impact on the US administration
 ffp kii report ke mutabik maamle se jude do sutron ne of da record america media main chal rahi reports kii pushti kii he
 Explain that the case of security clearance is classified
 security clearence radd hone ke baad 37 varshiya jered kushnar ke liye america ke ati surakshit sicrates tak pahunch paanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Trump refused to comment, with President Donald Trump's White House refusing to comment
 lekin, adhikariyon ne jor dekar kaha he ki is faisle se kushnar ke role par koi asar nahin padegaa
 However, the role of Jared Kushner as a power broker between the White House and the Middle East has been questioned after he lost his access to Top Secrets or Sensitive Compatible Information
 bataa den ki jered kushnar, trump ke chunavi abhiyaan kaa ahm hissaa rahe hai
 And his role in White House advisors has been equated
 trump kii beti ivaanka ke pati hai jeredmridubhashi jered kushnar america raashtrapati donald trump kii beti ivaanka ke pati hai or isroyal-philistin ke bich shanti samjhaute ke liye chal rahe prayaason kaa netritv karne waalon main se ek hai
 In addition, Jared Kushner has been a strong supporter of Washington's intense support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government
 kushnar kii security clearence ko lekar yah faisla netanyahu ke washington daure se thik pehle aayaa he
 'danger of losing credibility' According to former US negotiator David Miller, Jared Kushner may lose credibility among negotiators in the Middle East
 haalanki kushnar ke vakil ne isse pehle sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone clearence prakiya ko abhi puraa nahin kiya tha
 However, he had continued access to the secret material associated with the president's daily briefing
 america raashtrapati kii daily brifing america itenligence kaa 'taj' maani jaati he
 The change order after the Rob Porter case was ordered by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to change the clearance system
 aisa isliye kiya gaya kyonki rob porter naam ke ek sheersh sahyogi ne bina kisi security clearence ke white house main maheenon kaam kiya, jabaki un par apni do purv patniyon ke utpeedan kaa aarope laga tha
 Kelly said in his statement that he would not comment on personal matters
 ivaanka kii security clearence bhi sawaalon ke ghere menffp kii report ke mutabik ivaanka trump kii security clearence bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Ivanka had recently visited South Korea and discussed the new sanctions imposed on North Korea with President Moon-jin
 kushnar ke alaava anya stoff kii tarah hi ivaanka kaa bhavishya bhi white house main ab shaq ke daayre main he
 This time Sharadiya Navratri is starting on 21 September
 sabase khaas baat yah he ki is baar navaratri nau dinon kii hi hogi
 According to Jyotishacharya Shailendra Pandey, on September 21, the Kalash is established on Ashwin Shukla Pratipada
 is baar pratipada praatah 10

 shailaraj himalay kii kanya hone ke kaaran inhen shailaputree kaha gaya he
 Mother Shailputri holds trident in right hand and lotus flower in left hand
 inkaa vaahan vrishabh he
 The importance and powers of mother Shailputri are eternal in the Navadurga
 yun to varsh main do baar aane walenvaratrihar saal bahut khaas hote hai, lekin is baar 21 sitambar se prarambh hone ja rahe navaratri hast nakshatra main shuru honge, isliye apane aap main bahut behtareen sanyog he
 The importance of reduced establishment in Hasta Nakshatra, this time Navaratri is starting in Hasta Nakshatra
 aisi manyata he ki navaratri agar hast nakshatra main aae to uskaa vishesh mahatv hota he
 In this way, this festival is auspicious
 subah 10 baje tak puure puure vidhi-vidhaan se kii gai puja-archana ke saath ghat kii sthapana laabhakaari hogi
 This will increase happiness and prosperity in the family and at the same time, diseases and troubles will be removed
 is baar navaratri nau dinon keepichhali baar navaratri das dinon kii thi
 Sometimes, Navratri also becomes eight days due to two dates being the same day
 lekin is baranvaratrinau dinon kii hi he or 10wein din vijaydashami manaai jaaegi
 This is an auspicious coincidence

 After the death of Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar on Friday, Tarar changed his profile picture on Twitter and put a photo of a burning candle
 unka kahana he ki vah tharur se sirf do baar mili hai
 The last time i met was in India in April
 iske baad june main duusari mulaakaat dubai main hui
 The 45-year-old Meher, who lives in Lahore, told a Saturday night news channel 'geo Tej', 'there were a lot of other people present during these meetings
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jab maine ek lekh likhaa jisamen tharur kaa zikr tha to shaayad unki patni ko yah acha nahin laga ki jis aurat ko vah jaanati tak nahin hai or usne unke pati kii khub badai kii he
 So he asked them to stop talking to me
 iske baavjood vah mujhe twitor par follow karte rahe or iske baad unhone kaha ki meher ko follow karnaa bhi band karo
 The Pakistani journalist said, "I don't know why she had trouble with my husband talking to me through phone and email
" unke saath maine jo baatcheet kii he, vah duniya main kahin bhi kisi ke saath kar sakati hum
 'meher said,' did you find his name on Google? You will find that there were problems in their marriage since May and June

 She did not know me then and she was not holding me responsible
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘unka naam google par daaliye, aap dekhenge ki kya saamne aata he
 On that you will get reports of trouble in their marriage
 ye khabaren lambey samay se aa rahi hai
 Meher said that Sunanda first attacked him when he interviewed Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah
 unhone kaha, ‘unhone twit kiya ki hamaare mukhyamantri ne pakistani patrkaar se baat kyon kii he
 First the Pakistan Army sends and then the journalists
 unhone mujhase ladanaa shuru kar diya
 'meher claimed that she had been a' victim of conspiracy '
 unhone kaha, ‘mere saath sab kuch hua
 The Pakistani woman sitting here cannot ruin their marriage
 ’ pakistani patrkaar ne aarope lagaaya ki sunanda kaa twitor par hameshaa se duusare ke saath koi na koi maamla hua he
 Meher said, 'she used to get upset
 vah kuch kha nahin raheen thi
 He had stomach TB
 yah sab main nahin kah rahi hum, balki yah sab bhartiya media main saamne aayaa he
 If she quarreled with her husband and it affected her health, what does this have to do with my love story
 ’ My name is love

 Was there any need for the sudden controversy over BJP president Amit Shah about Hindi? Does BJP really have a language policy under which it wants to promote Hindi? Or is it retelling the old Jana Sanghi slogan of hindu-hindi Hindustan as its ideological heritage? Whether the idea of an undiscovered nation is love, religion is love, or language is love, its consequences are dangerous
 hindi ko desh kii rashtriya bhashaa banane kii baat kar unhone achaanak un logon ko hindi virdohi bana daalaa he, jinka anyathaa hindi se koi bair nahin he
 The condition is that even bjp's own Chief Minister of South India does not agree with Amit Shah's opinion
 ve kannada ko badhaava dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 For now, try to understand the different aspects of Amit Shah's statement
 hindi ko apane failaav yaa vistaar ke liye kisi rajkrupa yaa rajshray kii jarurat nahin he, yah baat swatah pramanit he
 Hindi is indeed a national language in terms of literature and cinema
 usne bahut udaartaa or lagaav ke saath duusari bhashaaon ke lekhakon ko apanaaya he or bhashaaon ke bich pul banaae hai
 For the common readers of Hindi, Vijay Tendulkar and Namdev Dhasal of Marathi are also authors of Hindi, Sharat and Vimal Mitra or Mahasweti Devi of Bangla, Girish Karnad of Kannada, Amrita Pritam of Punjabi as well - Mir and Ghalib are the authors of Hindi Only
 tivi serialon or cinema main bhi hindi kaa jo akhil bhartiya failaav he vah hindibhashiyon ko pramudit karne ke liye paryaapt he
 The spread of Hindi on mobile and Internet is encouraging
 duniya ke kai vishvavidhyalayon main hindi kii padhai ho rahi he
 In many countries of the world - very rarely - but Hindi writers are appearing
 yah ek gulabi paridrishy he jiske bich amit shah naam kaa koi netaa agar hindi ke sarovar main raajnneeti kaa pathar daalata he to uski hulchale dur tak jaati hai
 Suddenly, many people get fed up with Hindi? Then you have to ask, what was the need of this? Because if Hindi is seen spreading at one level then it seems to shrink at another level
 ham paa rahe hai ki hindi madhyam ke skool lagaataar band ho rahe hai or angrezi madhyam ke skool khulte ja rahe hai
 Hindi is a missing language in the younger generation of middle class belt of India which is spoken by their parents, grandparents and grandparents
 madhyavargeey gharon main hindi kii kitaaben ab na khridi jaati hai or na padhi jaati hai
 The truth is that Hindi has just changed into a dialect in which cinema can be made
 tivi serial ban sakate hai, angreji muhaavaron se bhari cricket comentary chal sakati he or vaise hi antarrashtriya sammelan ho sakate hai jaise bhojpuri ke hua karte hai
 Specialization work in other disciplines of knowledge science in Hindi has been made almost impossible
 bhautikee, rasayan yaa jeev vigyaan hi nahin, ab itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra or manovigyaan bhi kisi pichhadi bhashaa ke shabd maan liye gaye hai
 The reader of Hindi is happy to get this knowledge in maximum translation
 akhbaaron or tivi channelon main jo hindi chal or fail rahi he, vah angrezi kii baisakhiyon par chalati aisi smritiviheen or sarokaaravipann hindi he jisamen kuch sansanikhej afvahanuma khabaren hi chalaai jaati hai
 Even the editors of newspapers called Hindi serious do not have the power to write Hindi
 patrakarita ko takkar detii haalat vishvavidhyalayon kii he jahaan hindi ke 90 fisadi praadhyaapak sahi hindi nahin likh sakate
 In parallel, the empire of English is becoming increasingly large
 angreji ke lekhak ab khud ko bhartiya lekhak kehane lage hai
 He makes Hindi films on his books
 jabaki hindi lekhak kisi ittifaaq se yaad yaa istemaal kar liya jane vaala praani he
 English is a language of privilege in this country, a language of job guarantee, a language that can cover many disqualifications
 angrezi ke kisi aprachlit shabd kaa istemaal aapako sammanneey banaata he jabaki hindi main yahi kaam aapako haasyaaspad bana saktaa he- bana detaa he
 Return to the Modi government and bjp's language and culture policy
 yah dikhaai padataa he ki bijepi ko bhartiyata se prem he
 But what Indianness means to him- it is not clear
 hindutv ke prati uskaa atirikt aagrah ulte is bhartiyata ko kamazor karata he
 Similarly, she has been talking about hindi-hindu-hindustan since the time of Jana Sangh, but for her, Hindi also appears to be a case of false pride
 uske netaa jo hindi bolte hai, vah darp or daawey kii hindi hoti he, samvednaa kii nahin
 This use of Hindi is also seen less in his plans
 smart city, mek in india, skill india jaisi uski yojanaayen bataati hai ki uske liye vikaas kii avadharana bhi angreji main aati he, hindi main nahin
 It needs to be reiterated that Hindi is a language of ancient pride for him that does not contain the words of urdu-persian, it should be a Panditau Hindi in which knowledge-science cannot be done, Sanskrit smells
 yah anayas nahin he ki bijepi ke hindi premiyon kaa sanskrit prem bhi prabal he- ve sanskrit main shapath tak lete dekhe gaye hai
 No one should be opposed to Sanskrit
 sanskrit ek samrudh bhashaa he, lekin uskaa ek shastreey mahatv he or use usee rup main dekha janaa chahie
 She is not spoken in any region
 vah hamaari viraasat kaa hissaa he
 The problem is that some people have no Sanskrit love beyond their physical culture
 sanskrit siikhnaa to dur, ve saaf-suthri hindi yaa koi or bhashaa bhi likhane-bolne ko taiyaar nahin
 Language is for them a communal agenda just like religion
 agar nahin hoti to amit shah hindi kii nahin, bhartiya bhashaaon kii baat karte
 If he was not so enamored with the inevitability of English, he would have hesitated to use the name of English in his statement and would only keep talking about foreign language
 darasal ikkisvin sadi ke bharat kii bhashik chunautiyon ke kam se kam teen morche hai
 The first front is to liberate from the privilege of English, not from English
 ek bhashaa ke rup main angrezi bahut dur tak bhartiya bhashaa ho chuki he, bahut saare skool-college or santhaan angrezi main hi chalate hai
 As English learners grow, that privilege is weakening
 lekin yah dhyaan rakhana zaruri he ki angrezi navaupaniveshwaad kaa zariyaa na ho
 For this, it is necessary to enrich Hindi and other Indian languages
 unamem roti or rojgaar, gyaan-vigyaan ke raste khoje or khole jaaen
 This is the second front
 acchhee baat yah he ki agar hindi kaa ek bada tabaka angrezi main ja chukaa he to haashie par pade un samudaayon kaa ek nayaa tabaka hindi se judaa bhi he jinke bachche pehali baar skool ja rahe hai
 In this way, Hindi is removing something from the brains of its Brahminism which English is wearing
 hindi ab dalit-adivasee-stri pratirodh kii bhashaa he, vah marathi, bangla, tamil-telugu, urdu kii pratisparddhi nahin, unke saath bahnaape main chalane vaali bhashaa he
 But the third and most difficult front opens from here
 antat ye sari bhartiya bhashaaen sankat main hai
 New generations coming in these languages are seeing their future in English
 abhi jo log cinema, tivi serial or internet par hindi kii tarakkee dekh kar bahut khush hai, unhen ehsaas nahin he ki agle do dashakon main is taraqqi ke bhaap ban kar ud jane kaa khatara he
 Unaware of this danger, the Indian languages are fighting among themselves
 amit shah ke bayaan ne is ladaai main kuch ghi hi daalaa he- akhir bhashaaon kii bhi sampradayikta hoti he
 a fierce fire has erupted in JJ Colony of Bawana area of delhi
 is haadase main 100 se zyada jhuggiyaan jalakar khaak ho gai hai

 unhone spasht kaha ki bijepi or congress in dangon se munh nahin pher sakati
 When asked about the synergy of seats between the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress in the next election by journalists, he said that both parties get the mind, the nature is one and the idea is found
 is kaaran yah gathbandhan swaabhaavik he
 It was surprising when there was no alliance
 nitish ne kaha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) main argedy pehle se hi he
 He said that due to UPA government's policy of increasing the country's inflation, corruption has also increased during this government
 loksabhaa chunaav main jabardast janadesh milane ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sansad ke central haul main jab apane gathbandhan (NDA) ke sabhi 353 saansadon ko sambodhit kiya to agali sarkaar ke liye nayaa naaraa de diya
 The Modi government, working on the agenda of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, has now put forward the target of winning the trust of all

 This vision of PM Modi was appreciated from all sides
 bhartiya muslim samaaj ne bhi unki is drushti ko saraahaa

 unhone bataaya ki jiesti jaise faislon se bhartiya arthvyavastha main rukaawat ai thi or maujuuda vakt main iconomi chunauti kaa saamana kar rahi he
 According to Frank, PM Modi and the new finance minister will have to undergo major reforms to speed up the economy
 muslim samaaj or modi sarkarjis vishwaas ko jeetne kii baat piem modi ne apane bhaashan main kahi thi, use sahi tehraate hue frank islam ne kaha ki sirf muslim hi nahin, balki sabhi alpsankhyakon or daliton kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye piem modi ko kaam karnaa hoga
 In particular, it will be necessary for PM Modi to control some mischievous elements in the law
 frank ne kaha ki pakistan ko chhodkar islamic deshon samet puri duniya main modi sarkaar ke achche tallukaat hai
 In such a situation, if polarization happens inside India, then democracy will be weakened
 bhartiya muslim samaaj ko sambodhit karte hue frank islam ne kaha ki jo janadesh modi sarkaar ko mila he, use khule dil se sweekaar kiya janaa chahie
 Frank said that some violent incidents in the last five years have alienated Muslims
 aise main mujhe ummid he ki modi sarkaar ke nae vijan se ek nai shuruyaat hogi or bharat tarakkee ke raste par aage badhegaa
 Explain that Frank F

 It is said that he always triumphed under his influence
 jalandhar ke aatank se pareshaan hokar rurshi-munibhagwan vishnuke paas pahunche
 The Lord decided to dissolve Vrinda's husband's religion after much thought
 unhone yogamaya se ek mrit sharir vrinda ke ghar ke baahar phikvaa diya
 Due to the curtain of Maya, Vrinda saw the body of her husband
 apane pati ko mrit jaanakar vah us mrit sharir par girakar rone lagi
 At the same time a monk came to him and said, "daughter, don't be so sad
" main is sharir main jaan daal detaa hum
 The monk killed him
 bhaavon main bahakar vrinda ne us sharir kaa aalingan kar liya
 On the other hand, her husband Jalandhar, who was fighting with the gods, was killed as soon as Vrinda's essence was destroyed
 baad main vrinda ko pataa chalaa ki yah to bhagwaan kaa chal he
 When he came to know about this, he cursed Lord Vishnu that, in the same way you have deceitfully gave me husband
 usee tarah aapako bhi stri viyog sahane ke liye mrityulok main janm lenaa hoga
 Saying this, Vrinda sati with her husband's bier
 is ghatana ke baad traitayug main bhagwaan vishnu ne bhagwaan ram ke rup main avatar liya or sita ke viyog main kuch dinon tak rahanaa padaa
 It is also said that Vrinda cursed Vishnu that you have broken my sattva

 After this Vrinda sati with her husband
 jis jagah vah sati hui vahantulsi kaa paudhautpann hua
 Lord Vishnu was ashamed of his deceit

 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karne ke baad dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne bada faisla liya he
 The Kejriwal government has given free travel gifts to all women in metro and DTC and cluster buses
 yah faisla 2-3 maheenon main lagu ho jayega, lekin kejariwal sarkaar ne itnaa bada kadam kyon uthaaya ise lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Opponents are claiming that this decision has been taken in view of the assembly elections
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha he ki arvind kejariwal dehshat main hai or wo baukhala gaye hai
 Manoj Tiwari has termed the Kejriwal government's decision to provide free travel to women as a failed attempt to buy votes
 vahiin, aam aadmi party sutron kii maane to yah nirnay jaldbaaji main nahin uthaaya gaya he
 According to party sources, the issue was being discussed for several months after which the proposal of the plan was prepared
 parivahan vibhaag se mahila yatriyon kii sankhya bhi poochi gai or puraa moolyankan karne ke baad draft taiyaar kiya gaya
 The government says that the first suggestions in this regard have been taken from DMRC and DTC
 kyon liya yah faisla?arvind kejariwal sarkaar ke ek varisht mantri kaa kahana he ki is faisle kaa asal makasad mahilaon ko public transport kaa istemaal karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa he
 Also, women safety is also being said to be a big reason
 darasal, aam aadmi party dilli main mahila suraksha kaa mudda pramukhataa se uthaati rahi he
 There have also been claims of installing CCTV cameras in buses
 lekin is disha main sarkaar kii taraf se koi thos kadam nahin uthaae jane par kejariwal sarkaar ko virodhiyon se aalochana jhelni padati he
 Perhaps this is the reason that when Arvind Kejriwal announced the free journey on June 3, he also said that the process of installation of CCTV will start from next month (june) and by the end of this year a large number of this work will be completed
 
 iske alaava sarkaar ke sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki is kadam se matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Why the decision not to be implemented immediately? a senior minister of the government told Aaj Tak that it is not possible to implement this decision immediately, as it will have to bring a budget and call an assembly session
 saath hi is disha main janata ke suzav kaa bhi intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 However, this decision of the Kejriwal government is considered to be a big masterstroke in terms of assembly elections

 More than 120 pornographic movies recovered By now, the police has more than 120 pornographic films of 90 girls, but the police themselves do not even know what the exact count of Baba's excesses and pornographic films is
 Where does it end
 baba kii karatuuton se police bhi hairanin karatuuton kaa khulaasa hone ke baad beshak ab tak kaa ye sabase ayyash or badnaam baba amarpuri urf jalebi baba police ke shikanje main aa chukaa ho
 But after listening to Baba's misdeeds, the Haryana Police is also surprised
 baba ke ashram se aisi-aisi chizein baraamad ho rahi hai ki dekh kar lagata he maanon baba ne bholi-bhali or maasoom ladakiyon ko rusavaa karne ko hi apni zindagi kaa makasad bana rakhaa tha
 In every film with Baba, when one of his informers handed a new CD containing pornographic films of Baba to the new girl, Verdivale also trembled
 har film main baba ke ashram main bana tahkhaana, tahkhaane main rakhi chizein, aas-paas kaa maahaul, baba kii karatootein sabakuch ek jaisaa tha, bas har baar baba ke saath film main ek nai ladki hoti
 Baba's hypnosis would not only entice the new girl into a trap of hypnosis and intoxication, but instead of constantly swearing at her during her life, she would keep on saying that she is doing all this at her own will and pleasure
 asal main ye ek aisa maansik hatkandaa tha, jiske baad baahar jaakar kuch der ke liye khud ladki ke liye ye tay kar paanaa mushkil ho jaataa ki ye sabakuch asal main uski marzi se hui yaa marzi ke khilaaf
 Currently, the police have started questioning Baba on police remand for five days
 baba ke khilaaf nau maheene pehle report likhavane vaali ladki ek baar phir saamne aakar baba ke khilaaf taharir de chuki he
 But now the police are in need of testimony against Baba, who came to face the countless girls who became victims of Baba, with whom Baba had committed and whose porn movies were made and circulated
 taaki baba kii baaki kii zindagi salaakhon ke peeche hi nikal jaae
 "" Swine flu is spreading as an infection
 aise main sarkaar bhi kaaphi satarkta se kaam kar rahi he
 The government has provided for its treatment in all major government hospitals
 kya he ilajaswine flu ke lakshan prakat hone ke do din ke andar hi antiveiral drug dena jaruri hota he
 This gives relief to a patient and reduces the intensity of the disease
 iske baad marij ko tatkaal aspataal main bhartee kar den taaki peliative kear shuru ho jaae or taral padaarthon kii aapurti bhi paryaapt maatra main hoti rahe
 In most cases, antiviral drugs and hospitalization can be successfully treated
 swine flu se bachane kii dawaswine flu kaa ilaaj aam taur par sambhav he
 Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir (tamiflu) and zanamivir (relenza) can cure this infection
 ye davaaiyaan is sankraman ko failane or apni sankhya badhaane se rokatii he
 If these drugs are started within 48 hours of swine flu, they have good effect
 lekin ye davaaiyaan chikitsakon ke nirikshan main hi leni hoti he
 They also have some side effects such as jee mchalana, ootli, restlessness etc
 yah dawaaen desh ke sabhi bade aspataalon main uplabdh he
 The government has opened many more options for treating swine flu by giving treatment to private hospitals
 jinhen sabase adhik khatra he:swine flu ne un logon ko sabase adhik khatra he jinhen saans kii beemaari he jaise ki dama
 Apart from this, those who have neurological disease of the heart, liver, those who have diabetes are also at great risk
 iske alaava garbhvatee mahilaon or 5 varsh se kam aayu ke bacchon ko bhi kaaphi khatra he

 ) Owaisi's allegation against the government of discriminating on religious grounds even in providing notes from atms after demonetisation was denied in Muslim-dominated areas
 dilli ke okhla or puraani dilli ke balli maaraan or jama masajid ilaake main bhi logon ne kaha ki desh bhar main killat he, lihaaja ye iljaam munasib nahin ki sarkaar dharmik aadhaar par muslim bahul ilaakon ke atm main jaanboojh kar kam nakadi bhijwa rahi he
 When people were asked in the queues in front of the ATM of Indian Bank at the Sports Complex of Jamia Milia Islamia, as soon as one of these questions was asked, one supported Owaisi's point that people standing back and forth caught him
 pehle jawaab dene vaale janaab jinhone apana naam jameel bataaya fouran kaha ki ovaisi ne bilkul sahi kaha he, kyonki wo hameshaa sahi kehete hai
 There is a lot of problem with the decision, even their jumbo is not fulfilled that the big white beard with a dark white beard is broken, what is the right thing
 kya dilli ke baaki ilaakon main saare atm main choubison ghante rupee rahete hai
 Is there a problem of cash withdrawal from atms only in Muslim areas across the country
 ek noujvaan saaqib ne bhi kaha ki agar ovaisi ye kehete ki shaharon ke muqablegaanvonmen zyada dikkat he to baat sahi thi
 But it is not right to draw lines on this issue on politics and especially on communal grounds
 patrakarita kii ek chaatra ne bhi jaise hi ovaisi kii baat kaa samarthan kiya uski saheli ne fouran uski baat katate hue kaha ki ye sahi nahin he

 lekin nakadi teen se saat atm main hi mil rahi he, kuch teen chaar atm main to niyamit rup se nakadi bhari jaati he
 But the remaining 30 to 35 atms either did not receive cash for the last 35 days and did not come more than two or three times
 vahiin puraani dilli ke balli maaraan, jama masjid or chitali kabar ilaake main aabaadi 11 lakh se zyada he
 There are 25 atms of big and small foreign banks in these Muslim-dominated areas, but the cash is not more than four to five atms
 We also visited many atms and saw that most of the shutters were half-bent
 shakeel ahamed ne bataaya ki tang galiyon main nahin balki atm chaudee sadakon par hai lekin dikkat yahi he ki ham to paise nikaalane apane ilaake se baahar bhi gayi

 party ke ek anya netaa ne kaha ki sitapur ke rajesh kumaar ne aarep lagaaya tha ki tikat ke badale paise liye ja rahe hai, jiske baad ek khabariyaa channel dwaara sting kiya gaya
 Kejriwal also asked the media and the party's expectation of tickets to conduct a sting operation if anyone demanded money in lieu of tickets
 unhone kaha, ‘main spasht sandesh de rahaa hum ki jo koi bhi tikat ke liye paisa degaa, uskaa paisa barbaad chalaa jayega

 The former CM has clarified that he had never said anything like this
 neshnal conference ke sangrakshak faruk abdulla ne ravivaar ko kaha, 'maine aisa kabhi nahin kaha ki hambijapi ke saath gathbandhankarne ja rahe hai

 In such a situation, this is not the time to bargain with the BJP

 Sam Pitroda, the head and technocrat of the All India Congress Committee Overseas Cell, denied any connection between data company Cambridge Analytica and the Congress party
 pitroda ne guuruuvaar ko twits kii jhadi laga kar congress kaa bachaav kiya or saath hi media par jhooth failaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Pitroda said in a tweet, 'this news is completely rubbish
 ye bahut bada jhooth he or maafee ke saath is par viraam laganaa chahie
 i am well aware that the Congress Party has never used the services of Cambridge Analytic at the Central or State level in the past
 'I have been silently watching lies being spread on Indian Media, at a time to sensationalize news and mis-guide people on a variety of issues
 Some of these lies have resulted in unnecessary court cases and damaged our relationships and our thriving democracy
 — Sam Pitroda (@sampitroda)march 22, 2018pitroda ne ek or twit main kaha ki media main wo sab jinhone kaha ki congress necambridge analiticaca istemaal kiya or bhugtan kiya, un sabhi ko apana jhooth sweekaar karnaa chahie
 In a series of tweets, Pitroda said, 'I have been directly and indirectly a part of all the digital activities of the party
 main haq ke saath ye kah saktaa hum ki meri jaankaree main congress party ke cambridge analitica company ke istemaal karne kii khabar puri tarah juthi he
 'this news is utterly rubbish, it is simply a big lie and ought to stop with an apology
 i know for sure, that@incindiaparty has never used services of Cambridge Analytica at the center and / or state level in the past
 - Sam Pitroda (@sampitroda) March 22, 2018 According to Pitroda, he has spent 50 years in the telecom and IT business and knows a lot about big data, analytics, cloud computing, machine learning and other related technologies
 pitroda ne twits ke silsile ko badhaate hue kaha, 'main jaanata hum ki cambridge analitica ke paas mere jaise logon ko dene ke liye aisa kuch khaas nahin he jo main naa jaanata hum yaa jo main sikh nahin saktaa hum
 We are capable of doing such things ourselves and learning to implement them does not require expensive foreign experts
 'unhone kaha, 'main bharat main antarrashtriya saakh vaale kai data analytics visheshgyon ko nijee taur par jaanata hum jo wo sab kar sakate hai jo cambridge analytics pesh karata he, wo bhi kahin kam keemat par

 In a tweet, Pitroda said, 'you understand that we need foreign experts to analyze big data related to our people and our elections
 kya aap samajhate hai ki ham apane khud ke data ko analise karnaa nahin jaanate
 In his tweets, Pitroda also accused a section of the media of spreading lies
 ek twit main pitroda ne kaha, ‘main chupchaap dekh rahaa hum ki kis tarah bhartiya media main jhooth failaayaa ja rahaa he, khabaron ko sansanikhej banane ke liye or kai muddon par logon ko bhram main daalane ke liye
 According to Pitroda, such lies also led to unnecessary prosecution in courts and damaged our relations and growing democracy
 pitroda ne twit main likhaa ki taaja jhooth congress party ke bare main cambridge analitica istemaal karne or data kaa durupyog karne kaa he
 Against the increased prices of petrol and diesel, Rahul Gandhi was dominated in the Indian bandh of Congress
 unhone na sirf rajghat pahunchakar baapu kii samadhi par kailash maansarovar se laayaa jal chadhaaya balki vah sambhavitgathabandhanka netritv karte bhi dikhe
 UPA President Sonia Gandhi came for some time to protest against the joint opposition, but neither she gave a speech from the stage nor stayed there for long
 sawaal he ki kya sonia gandhi ne congress kii kaman saunpane ke baad gathbandhan kii bhi jimmedaari rahul gandhi ko saunp di he?iske pehle vipaksh kii baithkon kii adhyakshata sonia gandhi hi karti rahi hai
 What is not hidden from anyone is the attitude of leaders like Sharad Pawar and Mamta Banerjee on Rahul Gandhi's leadership
 yahi vajah he ki jab rahul gandhi rajghat pahunche to sabaki nazren is baat par tiki thim ki koun-koun vipaksh kaa netaa unke saath petrol pump tak unke paidal march main saath rahegaa
 When the leaders of the opposition started to unite on the stage in front of Ramlila Maidan, everyone's eyes were on whether Rahul Gandhi was going to lead the opposition? Because by then, according to the schedule, Sonia Gandhi had to join the protest after noon in the high prices of petrol diesel
 magar achaanak sonia gandhi ramlila maidan ke saamne petrol pump ke paas bane manch par pahunch gayi
 On reaching Sonia Gandhi, it seemed that she was going to take charge of the coalition once again, but shortly after, she left the stage after talking to Rahul and returned home
 sonia gandhi ke jate hi manch kii kaman rahul gandhi ne sanbhali
 Together with Congress in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala, he not only determined the names of the leaders who spoke from the stage but also made their order
 sabase baad main sabase varisht netaa sharad pavaar ko bolne ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 After him, Congress President Rahul Gandhi himself gave a speech
 manch par bhaashan ke kram ko dekhakar saaf tha ki congress ne is maukey ko rahul gandhi ke netritv ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 That means the biggest leader spoke later
 pichley saal disambar main sonia gandhi ne rahul ko adhyaksh kaa pad chunaav ke jariye saunp diya tha
 After this, many speculations have been made even after Sonia Gandhi did not contest from Rae Bareli
 sonia gandhi ke swasthya ko dekhte hue ab tak yah tay nahin he ki vah raibareli chunaav ladengi yaa beti priyanka
 Meanwhile, Sonia Gandhi cleverly tried to convey the message to opposition leaders that Rahul Gandhi will also coordinate with the opposition by giving Rahul Gandhi the opportunity to lead the joint opposition meeting
 sonia gandhi ne manch se na to bhaashan diya or naa hi vah zyada der vahaan rukeen
 If leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar are left in the opposition alliance, then most of the other line leaders, be it Tejashwi Yadav or Akhilesh Yadav, have no problem with Rahul's leadership
 yahi vajah he ki sonia gandhi dhire-dhire hi sahi lekin rahul gandhi ko gathbandhan kii raajnneeti main sakriy karnaa chaahati hai
 Sonia Gandhi tried to make Rahul Gandhi's leadership potential not only acceptable by giving the opportunity to lead the joint opposition program against the increased prices of petrol and diesel, but also in presenting him as the face of the alliance in the coming days

 pichley kai vidhansabha chunaavon main siem ke liye koi cheharaa project na karne or chunaav jeetne ke baad achaanak kisi nae chehre ko siem ke liye saamne laakar chaunkaane vaali bijepi ko ab kai tarah kii raajnneetik majaburiyon kii vajah se apni ranneeti badalani pad rahi he
 Just before the elections in Himachal, BJP declared Prem Kumar Dhumal as the face of the Chief Minister's post
 gujarat chunaav ke liye bijepi vijay rupani ko apana cheharaa bana chuki he or karnataka chunaav se to 7-8 maheene pehle hi bijepi ne vies yedyurappa kii aguwai main chunaav ladne kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Modi's face was important in the past, in the states where elections were held after Modi became Prime Minister in May 2014 - BJP contested every election Prime Minister's name and work
 yaa kahen modi hi iklauta cheharaa the-jiske bharose har chunaav main daanv khelaa gaya, or jin-jin rajyon main bijepi kii sarkaar bani-vahaan modi-shah ne apni pasand se mukhyamantri chunaa
 Then whether it was Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra or Khattar in Haryana or Yogi Adityanath in UP and if Sarbananda Sonowal was made face in Assam, he left the Congress and joined the BJP - while Kiran Bedi became the candidate in Delhi, she came out of that movement
 - which shook the Manmohan government of that time
 yani na kiran bedi or na sarvanad sonoval bijepi ke sadsy the
 He came to BJP before the elections and was made a candidate
 kya khatm ho rahi modi lahar!lekin ab agar modi ke hote hue bhi rajyon main bijepi ko ek chehre kii darkaar he to kya iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki modi kii lahar khatm ho rahi he
 Or Modi's development has been diminished by demonetisation and local issues in the shadow of GST, because the way Prem Kumar Dhumal has been made the chief ministerial candidate at the age of 73 years 6 months - he challenged Modi's Rule-75 Let's know, because everyone knows that JP Nadda was the first choice of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 lekin chunaav se ain pehle agar nadda ke bajaay dhumal kaa naam ghoshit hua to saaf he ki bijepi ko ek aisa cheharaa chahie tha, jo himachal kii raajnneeti kii nabj samajhataa ho, jiske paas voton kaa jatigat sameekaran saadhane kii haisiyat ho
 Dhumal belongs to the Rajput category, which has 38 per cent voters in Himachal
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi kii dikkat ye bhi thi ki jab tak dhumal ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua, tab tak himachal main ladaai virbhadra banaam modi maani ja rahi thi or bijepi aisa chaahati nahin thi
 Not even Modi's face in Gujarat! Do not want to break the head
 gujarat main bijepi ke liye jatigat sameekaran ahm ho gaye hai, or modi kaa cheharaa inke neeche dab gaya he
 Yeddyurappa in Karnataka, the way in which Yeddyurappa Koparti, who was surrounded by corruption charges in May, made his face - it is clear that power is important for BJP and bjp's thinking about Karnataka is also clear that there is no Modi magic Can walk and local politics is needed to handle local politics
 bijepi ko acchhee tarah maaloom he ki pichhali baar agar karnataka main camel khilaa tha to uski vajah yedurappa hi the-or yedurappa ke jane se party kii gutbaji sataha par aa gai thi
 But whatever the reason - these faces are telling that Modi is on the backfoot in the election of three important states, and he needs satraps

 upi main bhi aap hi siem candidet thim or dilli main to siem rahi hi hai
 Now at this age did you become the president? In response to this question, the veteran Congress leader said that you will ask this question to the party
 mujhe jo kaha gaya vah maine kiya
 Probably very few people understand Delhi as i understand it
 thodaa samay dijie, phir dekhiegaa kya meri umr mere raste main aati he yaa nahin aati he
 We will show you what you do not expect
 dilli main 15 saal tak mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit ne kaha ki haar jeet chalati rahati he

 jagan mohan reddy ne 30 may ko andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri kii shapath lene ke baad apane mantrimandal ke gathan main kareeb ek pakhwaade kaa vakt liya
 But through this, he has tried to create such a broad social alliance that will further strengthen his youth Shramik Rayathu Congress (YSRC) party after a landslide victory in the assembly elections
 apni team main rajya ke sabhi jilon or sabhi pramukh jatiyon kaa pratinidhitiv sunishchit karke jagan ne is dharna ko bhi badalane kii koshish kii he ki viesarsi mukhyatya agadi jati reddy kii party he
 Therefore, Jagan's 25-member cabinet has five deputy chief ministers representing different social groups: K
K
 narayan swami (anusuchit jati), paamula puspa shrivni (anusuchit janajati), pilli subhash chandra bose (pichhadi jati), amjad baasha shike (musalmaan) or allaa kaali krishna shrinivas (kapu jati)
 The Deputy Chief Minister is a mere name holder and has no constitutional responsibility or obligation, but Jagan can use these appointments to plead that he has fulfilled his election promise
 ve yah ummid bhi kar sakate hai ki dirghakaal main isse satta-virdohi lahar kaa prabhaav bhi khatm ho jayega
 Jagan's cabinet has seven ministers from backward castes, which is the largest community in the state in terms of population
 chaar-chaar log kapu or reddy samudaayon se hai
 In all, 14 posts have gone to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes and Minorities and 11 to the Forward Castes
 team main 19 log pehali baar mantri bane hai
 Jagan has also given place to Brahmins by electing Kona Raghupati as Deputy Speaker
 shrikakulam jile se pichde virgon ke netaa tammineni seetaram ko spikar chunaa gaya he
 For those mlas who are unhappy about not making a place in the government, Jagan has given up hope and announced that the performance of the ministers will be evaluated in the mid-term of the government's tenure
 viesarsi pramukh kaa iraadaa yah sanket dene kaa rahaa he ki unki sarkaar main vibhinn samoohon ke liye baraabar kii ahmiyat he

 kai peedhishon se chale aa rahe rajnatik bhedbhaav ko khatm karne ke aitihaasik faisle ne unhen ek rashtriya netaa main badal diya he
 Critics say that in the name of social justice and plurality, Jagan has lowered the politics of appeasement
 ve ise ek aise netaa kii siyaasi suvidha ke taur par dekh rahe hai jiske paas shashan kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 However, Jagan has started his innings fairly and has announced two schemes to generate employment and improve governance

 In this letter, Ajay Maken, Tajdar Babar, Arvinder Singh Lovely and Subhash Chopra have asked Rahul for an alliance
 pisi chaako ne kaha ki gathbandhan hoga yaa nahin yah faisla rahul gandhi karenge
 At the same time, Gopal Rai said that there will be no alliance with Congress in Delhi
 iske liye bahut der ho chuki he
 Even if the proposal comes from Congress, we will not talk
 hamaare saaton ummidavaar chunaav ladenge
 We alone will defeat the BJP
 hamaara chunavi abhiyaan 23 march se shuru hoga
 The party which is against the BJP should have an alliance: Chakopisi Chacko said that the party's working committee has also decided that whichever party is against the BJP, it should be aligned with it
 mujhe lagata he ki dilli ke netaa bhi iskaa paalan karenge
 Senior party leaders understand that it is very important to defeat the BJP at this time
 kyonki unki nitiyon se har koi pareshaan he
 Most leaders of the country feel that this is possible only through an alliance
 dilli main bhi aap se gathbandhan hona chahie
 All Congress leaders should respect the decision of the Working Committee
 5 march ko rahul gandhi ne congress netaaon ke saath kii thi baithkcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 5 march ko pradesh netaaon ke saath baithak kar aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan par charchaa kii thi
 The Congress is also conducting a survey to know the opinion of its workers regarding the alliance with AAP in Delhi
 survey par ajay maakan ne kaha tha ki rahul gandhi ke aadesh par hi surveykshan ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is directly monitoring this
 survey par koi sawaal uthaata he to vah sidhe taur par rahul gandhi par sawaal he
 Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted that the names of candidates have been announced in all the seven seats of Delhi on behalf of the Congress that came together to defeat the BJP
 isse pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit kar kaha tha ki ye behatar hota ki bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye congress bhi unke saath aa jaae
 But Sheila Dixit, the president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress, strongly opposed it
 iske baad pisi chaako ne audio sandesh jari kar congress kaaryakartaaon se raay maangi
 Ajay Maken had said that it is the culture of the party that the opinion of grassroots workers is sought in every major decision
 lekin ab congress or aap ke bich gathbandhan kaa koi maahaul banataa nahin dikh rahaa he
 There is no answer from the Congress whether it is Confusion or Confidence
 uttar pradesh chunaav main camel khilne se rokane ke liye akhilesh or rahul gandhi ne gathbandhan kaa faisla kiya lekin siton par sahmati kaa jod jud paata isse pehle hi khatpat kii khabar aani shuru ho gai
 The Samajwadi Party released the list of 209 candidates on Friday and the Congress is angry that many of these seats were with its influence and rights
 abhi ye haal he to phir bahumat milane par aage kya hoga
