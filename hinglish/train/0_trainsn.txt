 Amitabh Bachchan, fondly called 'big B', told in an interview, "every human has to go through ups and downs
 
 
 jo bhi upar aata he, use neeche janaa hi hota he
 
 
 i don't think I'm any different
 
 
 ham sabake jivan main utaar-chadhaav aate hai
 
 
 " unhone kaha, "agar aap safal hote hai to aapako dhyaan rakhana chahie ki yah zyaada der tak nahin tikne vaali
 
 
 If you are failing you must fight and return
 
 
 " chaar dashak se bhi lambe samay se jari apane shandaar kariyar main kareeb 180 filmon main kaam kar chuke mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne kaha ki unke samakaleen abhinayta bhi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Bachchan said, "I never make a decision about myself (being popular)
 
 
 mere samakaleen abhinayta mujhase peeche rah gaye
 
 
 It would be wrong to say so
 
 
 maine kabhi apni lokapriyata par dhyaan nahin diya
 
 
 People can write whatever they want, but it doesn't matter to me
 
 
 " unhone apane puraane saathiyon kaa naam lete hue kaha ki shatrughna sinha, vinod khanna, dharmendra or rishi kapur ab bhi filmon main sakriy hai, or durbhagyavash shashi kapur biimaar hai, varanaa vah bhi sakriy hote
 He said, "today Vinod Khanna and Shatrughan Sinha have reached politics and are doing well
 
 
 mujhe to aisa lagata he ki main unase peeche chhot gaya hum
 
 
 "amitabh Bachchan revealed that Dilip Kumar and Waheeda Rehman are also his favorite artists, and both these artists are also his role models
 unhone kaha, "jab aap bhartiya cinema ke itihaas kii baat karte hai to yah do hisson main baanta ja saktaa he
 
 
 One before Dilip Kumar, and the other after him
 
 
 " Recalling the days of shooting for the film 'shakti', Bachchan said, "when you work with your favorite actor, you get a lot of emotions
 
 
 vah (dilip kumaar) aise hai, jinhen maine bachapan se dekha he
 
 
 i felt a little weird when we both came together for the shoot
 
 
 yah mere liye pachaa paanaa bahut mushkil tha ki main dilip sahab ke saath screen par dikhuunga
 
 
 i am lucky that i got a chance to work with him
 
 
 main unase ab bhi sampark main hum
 
 
 " amitabh bachchan ne apane nirdeshkon ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki unhen kai nirdeshkon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila, lekin vah rishikesh mukherjee ko apana 'godfadar' maanate hai
 He also thanked Khwaja Ahmed Abbas, who gave him his first film 'saat Hindustani'
 unhone kaha, "main rishikesh mukherjee ko apana 'godfadar' maanata hum
 
 
 Everyone feels that i have done more films with Prakash Mehra and Manmohan Desai, but this is not true
 
 
 maine rishi da ke saath zyaada filmein kii hai
 
 
 " unhone kaha, "manmohan desai main ek tarah kaa paagalpan tha
 
 
 He recognized the pulse of the audience
 
 
 yash chopra ne mere kariyar kii sabase badi filmein deen
 
 
 At the same time i also worked with Mukul Anand and Tinu Anand
 
 
 "tippaniyan Amitabh Bachchan also praised the current as well as new directors like Karan Johar, Prakash Jha, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Shujit Sarkar

 It is noteworthy that Amitabh Bachchan took a break from films with entering politics in 1984
 vah elahabaad seat se congress ke saansad bane the, haalanki teen saal baad hi unhone raajnneeti se tauba kar lee
 Amitabh Bachchan is currently running the sixth edition of his successful TV reality show 'kaun Banega Crorepati' on the small screen
 pyaar se 'big bi' kahkar pukaare jane vaale amitabh bachchan ne ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya, "har insaan ko utaar-chadhaav se guzaranaa hota he
 
 
 Whatever comes up has to go down
 
 
 mujhe nahin lagata ki main kisi se alag hum
 
 
 We all have ups and downs in our lives
 
 
 " He said, "if you are successful, then you should keep in mind that it is not going to last long
 
 
 agar aap asafal ho rahe hai to aapako ladanaa chahie or vaapasi kerani chahie
 
 
 "in his illustrious career spanning over four decades, megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who has worked in nearly 180 films, said that his contemporary actors are also doing well
" bachchan ne kaha, "main apane bare main (lokapriy hone ke bare main) kabhi nirnay nahin letaa
 
 
 My contemporary actors lagged behind me
 
 
 aisa kahana galat hoga
 
 
 i never paid attention to my popularity
 
 
 log jo chahen, likh sakate hai, lekin mujhe isse fark nahin padataa
 
 
 "he named his old comrades that Shatrughan Sinha, Vinod Khanna, Dharmendra and Rishi Kapoor are still active in films, and unfortunately Shashi Kapoor is ill, otherwise he would have been active as well
" unhone kaha, "aaj vinod khanna or shatrughna sinha raajnneeti main pahunch chuke hai or acha kar rahe hai
 
 
 i feel that i have missed them
 
 
 " amitabh bachchan ne bataaya ki dilip kumaar or wahidaa rahamaan unke pasandida kalakaar bhi hai, or yahi donon kalakaar unke adarsh bhi hai
 He said, "when you talk about the history of Indian cinema, it can be divided into two parts
 
 
 ek dilip kumaar se pehle, or doosraa unke aane ke baad kaa
 
 
 " film 'shakti' kii shooting ko dinon ko yaad karte hue bachchan ne kaha, "jab aap apane priy kalakaar ke saath kaam karte hai to aapke man main bahut saare bhav aate hai
 
 
 He (dilip Kumar) is one whom i have seen since childhood
 
 
 jab ham donon shooting ke liye saath aae to mujhe thodaa ajeeb laga
 
 
 It was very difficult for me to digest that i would be seen on screen with Dilip Sahab
 
 
 main khushnaseeb hum ki mujhe unke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 
 
 i am still in contact with him
 
 
 " Talking about his directors, Amitabh Bachchan said that he got the opportunity to work with many directors, but he considers Hrishikesh Mukherjee as his 'godfather'
 unhone khwaja ahamed abbaas kaa bhi shukriya adaa kiya, jinhone unhen unki pehali film 'saat hindustani' main kaam diya tha
 He said, "I consider Hrishikesh Mukherjee my 'godfather'
" 
 
 sabko lagata he ki maine prakaash mehara or manmohan desai ke saath zyaada filmein kii hai, lekin yah sach nahin he
 
 
 i have done more films with Rishi Da
 
 
 " He said, "manmohan Desai had a kind of madness
 
 
 vah darshakon kii nabz ko pahachaanate the
 
 
 Yash Chopra gave the biggest films of my career
 
 
 usee samay maine mukul anand or tinu anand ke saath bhi kaam kiya

 Working with Ashwini has always been like new expectations, opening new doors as an artist

 You will mess with yourself and your own boundaries

 BSP candidate from Jalalpur seat Rakesh Pandey left vacant after being elected as MP for Platitresh Pandey
 This seat, which holds a strong hold of the Pandey family, Sanjay Rajbhar, son of Jalalpuram, Rajbhar, can get ticket
 Has already left the electoral field
 jalalpur seat se upachunaav ke liye basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne purv saansad rakesh pandeya ko buudhvaar ko pratyaashee ghoshit kiya tha, lekin unhone swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dekar chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya he
 With Rakesh Pandey leaving the election ground, it will not be easy for the BSP to win this seat
 purv saansad rakesh pandeya ke chunaav ladane se inkaar ke baad basapa rashtriya mahasachiv purv mantri ranchal rajbhar ke putr sanjay rajbhar ke chunaav ladane kii charchaa he
 In 2017, Sanjay contested from Akbarpur seat, but could not succeed
 mana ja rahaa he ki rakesh pandeya ke chunavi maidan chhodane ke baad basapa pramukh sanjay rajbhar par daanv laga sakati hai
 Please tell that Rakesh Pandey, son of Rakesh Pandey, was elected as MLA from BSP in Jalalpur Assembly seat in 2017
 lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ritesh pandeya ne ambedkarnagar sansadeey seat se saansad chune jane ke baad vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha, jiske chalate jalalpur vidhansabha seat rikt hui he
 The 'pandey family' is believed to have a strong hold in the Jalalpur assembly constituency
 isi ke chalate pehle se hi mana ja rahaa tha ki basapa 'pandeya parivaar' se kisi sadsy ko chunavi maidan main utaaregi
 According to sources, his elder son Ashish Pandey was named as a candidate before former MP Rakesh Pandey
 basapa pramukh ne ashish pandeya ko dilli main hotel vivaad ke chalate tikat nahin diya tha
 On Wednesday, BSP chief Mayawati announced the names of party candidates for the assembly by-elections, while former MP from Jalalpur seat Rakesh Pandey was named
 purv saansad ne guuruuvaar ko swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue chunaav ladane se hi inkaar kar diya
 MP Ritesh Pandey has shared information about his father Rakesh Pandey not contesting elections on his Facebook wall
 ritesh pandeya ne apane fasebuk par likhaa he ki pichley aath maheenon main unke pita ke do oparation hue hai
 Recently, he underwent an operation at Gangaram Hospital in Delhi ten days ago
 is kaaran doctor ne unhen puri tarah se aaraam karne ko kaha he or thakne se manaa kiya he
 Because of this, he will not contest elections
 janata pariwaraka ateet hameshaa se hi matbhedon bharaa rahaa he
 Instead of unity and solidarity, strife and disintegration are the indelible articles written by the Janata Dal's horoscope
 aaie jaraa najar daalate hanjanata dal kii buniyaad se jude netaonke bikharaav bhare ateet par
 The soldiers of the struggle set out to meet today, again to decorate the desolate chaman whom Raunak has often mutilated with his own hands
 immergency ke baad desh main janata sarkaar baniin to usee vakt se janata parivaar main jhagade kii aag aisi sulgi kii lokanayak jaiprakash narayan kaa sampurna kranti kaa sapana unheen kii ankhon ke saamne chakanachur ho gaya
 The intoxication of power took over the revolution, due to which the socialist clan was gradually transformed into the politics of caste mobilization and dynastic factions
 janata sarkaar main morarji desai or choudhary charan singh ke bich bantwaaraa ho gaya
 After separating from Morarji's government, Chaudhary Charan Singh formed the government with the support of the Congress
 janata sarkaar ke patan ke baad janata party kaa samaajawaadee kunba bhi bikhar gaya
 Whosoever got the way of politics, he started doing politics through the same party and finally during the Rajiv Gandhi government, the alleged genie of the scandal that came out of the Bofors gun gave the Janata Parivar a chance to unite
 rajeev sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe vishwanath pratap singh ne congress se baghawat kar di to saare yuva turk unki chhatari ke neeche aakar khadey ho gaye
 Janata Dal's foundation was laid
 11 oktober 1988 ko veepi singh kii aguwai main janata dal kii buniyaad padi
 Janata Party, Janam Morcha and Lok Dal merged into Janata Dal
 lekin veepi singh sarkaar banane ke baad janata dal main pehali tut chandrashekhar kii aguwai main hui
 Chandrasekhar broke away and formed the Janata Dal Samajwadi
 congress ke samarthan se wo pradhanmantri bane
 However, the Chandrasekhar government fell within four months
 janata dal samaajawaadee kaa naam badalakar samaajawaadee janata party ho gaya
 Then the process of partition started
 ahm kii ladaai main dil tuutane ke saath hi dal bhi tukade tukade hota chalaa gaya
 If any leader goes here and there
 veepi singh, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar or sharad yadav ke saath devegoda janata dal ko bachaane main jute lekin koi tarkeeb kaam nahin ai
 Chandrashekhar and Mulayam Singh Yadav, who split from the Janata Dal, also split
 1992 main mulaayam singh yadav ne samaajawaadee janata party se alag hokar samaajawaadee party kaa gathan kar liya
 In 1992, Chaudhary Ajit Singh also broke away from the Janata Dal and formed a new party called RLD
 ye janata dal main duusari tut thi
 In 1994, George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar separated from the Janata Dal and laid the foundation of the Samata Party
 ye janata dal kii teesri tut thi
 In 1996, Karnataka leader Ramakrishna Hegde also broke away from the Janata Dal, forming a new party called Lokshakti
 ye janata dal kii chauthi tut thi
 In 1997, Lalu Yadav split from the Janata Dal and formed the RJD
 ye janata dal main paanchavi badi tut thi
 Naveen Patnaik split from the Janata Dal in 1998
 odisha main bijedy kaa gathan hua
 This was the sixth major breakdown of the Janata Dal
 1999main bache-khuche janata dal ke bhi do hisse ban gaye
 Janata Dal Secular led by Deve Gowda and Janata Dal United led by Sharad Yadav
 ye bikharaav kaa saatvaan adhyay tha jisamen janata dal kaa astitv hameshaa ke liye khatm ho gaya
 So this was a short story to reach the last stop of Janata Dal's journey
 bantwaare kaa silsilaa aage bhi chalata rahaa or janata dal se nikalakar bani partiyon main bhi bikharaav ek sire se duusare sire tak badhata hi gaya
 For example, Ram Vilas Paswan broke away from the JDU and formed the Lok Janshakti Party and the Janata Parivar leaders not only joined hands for power but also joined the NDA led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 satta ke liye vichaar ko peeche chhodane ke is safar main ekajutata kii jarurat bhi vakt vakt par chand netaaon ne mahasoos kii
 The Samata Party led by George Fernandez and Nitish Kumar merged with JDU led by Sharad Yadav
 yani bikhare janata parivaar main milan kii prakriya bhi shuru hui jo ab phir se paravaan chadh rahi he

 Also thousands of people were kept in detention since August

 In this regard, Congress leaders targeted the Modi government and also demanded the release of these leaders

 Advocating independent thinking on university campuses, President Pranab Mukherjee said that instead of propagating a culture of unrest, students and teachers should engage in discussion and debate
 unhone kaha ki chaatro ko ashaanti or hinsa ke bhavar main fansaa dekhnaa dukhad he

 congress netaa or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke nagpur sthit rashtriya swayamsevak sangh karyaalay jane ke kai laabh bhaajapa or sangh ko milte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Arguments can be made to say that there is a close relationship between Mohan Bhagwat and Pranab Mukherjee
 wo ek-duusare wo vyaktigat rup se pasand karte hai
 Pranab da has even broken the protocol to receive Mohan Bhagwat as President
 lekin kahani itani bhar nahin he
 With the news of Pranab Mukherjee's departure, Congress and other political parties, sociologists started opposing the decision and Pranab da was being advised not to attend the Sangh program
 yahaan tak ki unki beti or congress kii netaa sharmishtha mukherjee ne apane pita ko saarvajanik rup se aagaah kiya ki unke sangh ke kaarykram main jane se unhen kuprachaar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 People will forget Pranab da's speech and his photographs with the Sangh chief will continue to follow him for decades
 lekin yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki naahak hi sangh ne pranab mukherjee ko apane kaarykram main nahin bula liya
 This has been done under a well thought out strategy
 pranab ko bulaane kaa sabase pehla laabh to yah hua ki jis sangh shiksha varg kii khabar aanchalik str par chap kar khap jaati thi, wo do ghante tak sabhi bade media channelon par live dikhaaya gaya

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii kaksha main pranab ne padhaayaa gandhi-nehru kaa rashtravadapranab ko sangh ke angan main dikhaane kii utsukata main puraa desh sangh ke prashikshit swayamsevakon kaa lathi chalaanaa, karataben karnaa or padasanchalan dekh rahaa tha
 After this people heard Mohan Bhagwat live
 is puure bhaashan main hindutv kii baat to mohan bhagwat ne kii hi lekin saavdhaanee se ek soft line lete bhi nazar aae
 Mohan Bhagwat was successful in exposing the nation to a liberal Hindu image unlike the activities of the Sangh and its allied organizations
 unhone vividhta main ekta kii baat kahi
 All religious castes are the children of one Mother India
 yahaan par rahane vaale sabhi dharmon ke purvaj ek hai jaisi baaten kisi bhi saamaanya hindu vyakti ko sahi or sakaaratmak hi lagi hongi
 Seeing Jinnah's song fail in front of sugarcane, it is important for the Sangh to appear more generous and equitable
 isiilie bhaajapa or sangh sampark or samvaad kaa naaraa lekar prachaar main nikal chuke hai
 Mohan Bhagwat's live speech in the presence of Pranab da was actually an attempt by the Sangh to openly campaign for 2019
 is drushti se sangh apane pranab ke bahaane apane prachaar or chhavi sudhaar main safal rahaa
 Second biggest benefit for BJP is BJP
 bhaajapa ko pataa he ki uttar pradesh or rajasthan jaise rajyon main wo 2014 kaa pradarshan doharaa paane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Sources reveal that the BJP can change the Lok Sabha candidate in 150 seats
 80 siton par unhen haar kaa dar he
 But he also hopes to win 50 seats
 in ummid vaale rajyon main do naam odisha or bengal ke bhi hai
 Pranab da being Bengali and speaking from the Sangh platform will act like a different magic for the BJP in Bengal
 ise bengali asmita or sammaan se jodakar prachaarit karne main bhaajapa koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 Modi has already made up his mind for Odisha to contest from Puri in the next Lok Sabha election
 agar aisa hota he to iskaa sidhaa laabh donon hi rajyon main bhaajapa ko mil saktaa he
 Amit Shah's Mathematics is expecting 22 seats from Bengal

 Is it a blow to Rahul's campaign against RSS Pranab Mukherjee to go to Nagpur? The third big advantage BJP is getting is that it was first engaged in trying to make Congress leaders its heroes
 gandhi kaa chashma sarkari yojanaon kaa chinh ban gaya
 For the statue of Patel, it was announced to build an idol by collecting iron from all over the country
 ambedkar ke liye modi ji ji-jaan se jute hue hai ki unke naam par smarak banavaaen or congress dwaara unke apmaan ko janata ke bich baar-baar doharaaen
 The families of Subhash Chandra Bose and Lal Bahadur Shastri are also brought to the dais by the BJP every time and on the pretext that the BJP tries to isolate all the heroes of the Congress party and propagate it as a single family party
 Go pranab da kii sangh ke kaarykram main upasthiti asantusht congressiyon ke liye sanket bhi he or sandesh bhi
 The way Sangh and BJP have been praising Pranab da since he went to this program is to convey a message to the dissidents and seniors of the Congress
 pehle hi kai bade congressi chehre bhaajapa main shaamil ho chuke hai
 If you look at social media and other media, those pictures and things are being viral in the name of Pranab da, which is neither the truth of his presence nor the words of his statement
 yah ganda prachaar tantra ab pranab da ko kis str par tode-marodega, yah aage aage aap dekhte hi jaaenge

 Recall Rahul Gandhi's speeches till Pranab da's departure, where Rahul has called both the Sangh and BJP together to be fascist and enemy of democracy
 sangh par gandhi kii hatya kaa aarope lagane vaale rahul gandhi ke liye pranab da ne mushkilen zarur khadi kar di hai
 The BJP and the Sangh also want the Congress to play and speak according to their laid net and get entangled in it
 aise samay main jabaki congress ko mukhar hokar sattapaksh ko gherna chahie, wo khud bhaajapa or sangh ke chakravyuh main ulajhati nazar aa rahi he
 The Sangh and the BJP are deciding the agenda of the entire debate

 The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has imposed an interim stay on the execution of the sentence of Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav
 jadhav ko pakistan kii sainya adaalat ne jasusi kaa doshi qaraar dete hue maut kii sajaa sunai he
 India appealed in the ICJ on 8 May against this decision of the Pakistani military court
 bataaya jaataa he ki ICJ ke adhyaksh roni abraham ne pakistan sarkaar ko ek patr likh kar kaha he ki vah is tarah karrwai kare, jisase is maamle main jari hone vaale adaalat ke kisi aadesh kaa kriyanvayan sambhav ho sake
 Now what next? After the efforts of India, now the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav will be heard on May 15 in the international court
 bharat or pakistan ko ab yahaan likhit halafanama dena hoga
 However this affidavit will not be made public, provided both countries agree on it
 iske baad kulbhushan jadhav maamle main agle daur kii sunwaayee ke dauraan jirah shuru hogi
 The international court will deliver its verdict publicly after the arguments in the case are completed
 ICJ kaa yah aadesh antim mana jayega, jiske khilaaf bharat yaa pakistan apil nahin kar paaenge
 ICJ verdict on Kulbhushan How binding is the order of the international court? The ICJ has stated on its website that its orders are completely binding and since all the member countries of the United Nations take an oath to obey the order of the international court, it is rare Its decisions may not have been implemented
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki antarrashtriya adaalat ke paas apane aadesh ko lagu karwaane ke liye sidhe koi shakti nahin hoti
 In such a situation, if any country feels that the other country has not served the ICJ order, then it can appeal to the UN Security Council
 is par phir suraksha parishad us aadesh ko lagu karwaane ke liye us desh ke khilaaf kadam uthaa saktaa he
 However, there have been many occasions when the Security Council has failed to take steps in this condition
 udhaaharan ke liye nikaragua or america ke bich kaa cese len, to 1986 main america ne use antarrashtriya kanoonon ke ulanghan kaa doshi qaraar dene vaale ICJ ke aadesh ke kriyaanvyan par vito laga diya tha
 The international court in that case had found that the US supported the rebels standing against the Nicaragua government
 haalanki yah latin america desh vito lagane kii vajah se us aadesh ko taamil nahin kara sakaa tha
 In the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, even if the ICJ order goes against Pakistan, it will be difficult to implement it
 is maamle main use suraksha parishad se madad kii darkaar hogi
 However, Pakistan's 'evergreen partner' China is also a member of this powerful group
 aise main aanshaka he ki vah ICJ ke aadesh par vito laga saktaa he, jisase ise lagu karvaa paanaa mushkil hi prathit hota he
 Explain that Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former employee of the Indian Navy, is doing business in Iran by taking retirement, where he was abducted by Pakistani intelligence officials
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa he ki uske suraksha balon ne 3 march, 2016 ko baluchistan se jadhav ko giraftaar kiya
 It is alleged that Jadhav was involved in espionage and terrorism in Balochistan and Karachi
 jadhav kii giraftaar kii khabar milane ke baad bhartiya ucchayog ne darjanon baar unase milane kii ijaajat maangi thi
 But Pakistan did not allow it, bypassing all international laws

 In such a situation, the question arises as to whom are the RJD workers in danger of their lives? So know, Sanoj Yadav has to give his life to Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of Lalu Prasad Yadav, the national president of his own party and the Health Minister in Bihar Sarkara

 Now Sanoj is feeling ashamed of Tej Pratap's action
 sanoj yadav ne kaha ki jab tej pratap uske saath gaali-galouj or marpet kar rahe the tab vahi par lalu prasad baithe hue the magar unhone kuch bhi nahin kiya or sab kuch chup-chaap dekhte rahe

 congress party ne reeta bahuguna joshi ke congress chhodkar bijepi jwine karne par karaara prahaar kiya he
 Congress's UP state president Raj Babbar said that Rita Bahuguna Joshi's family has a long history of defection
 'congress par nahin padegaa asar'raaj babbar ne kaha kirita bahugunake jane se congress par koi asar nahin padegaa
 The Congress termed it trafficking and accused the BJP of harboring traitors
 'seat nahin jeet sakati thim'reeta bahuguna kebijapi main jane par pratikriyadete hue congress ke netaa gulab nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki avasarwaadi netaa ek jagah tikte nahin
 The real thing is that she could not win the seat
 muqabla kaaphi mushkil tha
 'old history of family', while Congress campaign in-charge of UP Dr
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki reeta bahuguna joshi abhi bijepi main gayi hai
 Earlier his brother and even before that his father had left Congress
 isliye hamen koi hairaani nahin hui
 It is unfortunate that she is making such statements
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki ek din yahi reeta bahuguna kah rahi thim ki modi fasivadi hai or desh ko fasiwad kii taraf le ja rahe hai
 Today, there is an attack on Rahul Gandhi
 ye avasarwaad nahin to kya he
 BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi today indirectly targeted the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, saying that there is a wave of BJP in the country, not Modi
 bijepi kii ghoshnaptr samiti ke adhyaksh joshi ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki modi dwaara pesh kiya gaya vikaas ke gujarat model ko sabhi rajyon par lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said that he was not in favor of applying the model of one state to all states
 modi ke liye varanasi sansadeey seat chhodane vaale joshi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri pad ke unke ummidavaar sheersh pad ke liye maatr party ke ek pratinidhi hai or unhen puure desh or bhaajapa netaaon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 He said, Modi is a representative of the party as a prime ministerial candidate
 
 
 isliye yah ek atyant vyaktigat baat (lahar) nahin he
 It is a wave of representation
 joshi ne ek media channel se kaha ki unhen desh ke vibhinn hisse, samaaj ke sabhi virgon or bijepi ke sabhi netaaon se samarthan miltaa he
 This controversial comment by Joshi may generate resentment within the party
 joshi ne iske saath hi jaswant singh ke mudde par bhi tyoriyaan chadhaai or kaha ki nishkasit varisht netaa ko party tikat nahin dene kaa nirnay party kii kendriya chunaav samiti main nahin liya gaya jiske vah sadsy hai balki yah nirnay party adhyaksh or rajasthan kii mukhyamantri dwaara kiya gaya
 He said, this is not a decision taken back
 joshi ne us vikaas ke model par baat kii jise bijepi nit endie sarkaar satta main aane par aage badhaane kii ichha rakhti he or kaha ki vah kisi ek vishesh rajya ke model kaa paksh nahin lete balki vah vibhinn rajyon ke vikaas ke achche binduon ko lenaa chahenge
 He said, this is the model of development introduced by BJP
 bharat jaise desh main vikaas kaa jo model jammu kashmir yaa arunachal pradesh ke liye sahi he, ho saktaa he ki vah kerala ke liye sahi naa ho
 He said, so it is not right to say this model or that model
 isamen kuch achche bindu ho sakate hai, isamen tripura sarkaar ke bhi kuch achche bindu ho sakate hai yah koi tay formula kaa vishesh model nahin
 On the statement of senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad Joshi said that he would react only after seeing Joshi's comments

 bachche kii maa mehanaj ne kaha ki ye naam rakhane par us par samaaj kaa dawaab padane laga, kai logon ne kaha ki agar naam na badla to samaaj se baahar kar denge

 He said that if he is excluded from society, where will he go? Mehnaz said that his family is Modi ji's wishes, so he happily named him, but he had no idea of this dispute

 Now he has named the child Altaf Alam and Mohammad Modi
 mehanaj kaa kahana he ki vah musalmaan he or yah naam rakhana jaruri he

 He said that the Congress wants to eliminate the 'politics of divisions'

 Accusing the RJD-LJP alliance of politics of caste and religion, apart from the NDA, Rahul said, "we oppose such an alliance"
 ham sabhi ke liye nyaay or vikaas sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai, chaahe vah garib ho yaa amir, hindu ho yaa muslim, sikh ho yaa isai
 He said that the Congress is above this kind of politics, so the party decided to contest alone in 243 assembly constituencies in Bihar

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘lekin maine yah bidaa uthaaya or uttar pradesh main party kii safalataa sunishchit kii evam log ab maujuuda vyavastha ke sthaan par congress ko upyukt vikalp maanane lage hai
 Rahul said that i am confident that the same will happen here

 Tabassum Hasan is an MP from the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 ve ek raajnneetik gharaane se aati hai
 Kairana is the family seat of Tabassum Hasan
 uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton main kairana hi aisi seat he jo kisi muslim saansad ke hawaale he
 Tabassum Hasan is the wife of the late Munawar Hasan
 munwwar hasan kairana seat se do baar vidhayak or do baar saansad bhi rah chuke hai
 From Kairana seat, Tabassum Hassan's father-in-law Chaudhary Akhtar Haman has also been an MP
 tabassum hasan, 2009 main bahujan samaaj party se saansad rah chuki hai
 Tabassum Hasan has changed three parties since 2009
 tabassum ke pati munwwar hasan kii ek road accident main maut ho gai thi
 He won against veteran leader Hukum Singh in the election held just days after his death
 pati kii raajnneetik viraasat sanbhaalane ke liye tabassum ko khaasi mehnat kerani padi
 In 2014, Tabassum Hasan vacated her seat for son Nahid
 nahid samaajawaadee party kii ore se chunaav lade
 BJP veteran Hukum Singh was in front of him
 modi lahar main bharpoor koshishon ke baad bhi tabassum bete kii seat bachaa paane main naakaamayaab raheen
 Kairana Lok Sabha seat of western Uttar Pradesh is a very important seat in political terms
 2014 main modi lahar ke bich is seat par bhartiya janata party ke hukum singh ne jeet darj kii thi, lekin unke nidhan ke baad 2018 main hue upachunaav main sanyukt vipaksh kii pratyaashee tabassum ne bhartiya janata party kii mriganka singh ko maat di
 This led to a different message in the country and it was said that the Modi wave had stopped
 rashtriya lokdal kii ummidavaar tabassum hasan ko samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress ne samarthan diya tha
 The defeat was seen as a major setback for the BJP, which came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017 with a thumping majority
 uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan kii aas dekhi jane lagi lekin sapa or basapa ek ho gaye or congress ko sammanjanak seat na milane ke chalate use mahagathbandhan kaa moh chhodana padaa
 This time Kairana is likely to have a triangular fight
 bhaajapa ne is baar mriganka singh kii jagah pradeep choudhary ko tikat diya he
 At the same time, Congress has fielded its strong leader Harendra Singh Malik
 dekhne vaali baat yah hogi ki kya tabassum phir se jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab hoti hai yaa nahin
 Tabassum Hasan got very little time in Parliament as an MP
 wo sirf do hi sadanon main hissaa le sakin
 During this, he asked 4 questions
 sitambar, 2018 main tabassum ko sansad kii human resors devlepment kii standing cameti main shaamil kiya
 Apart from being a Member of Parliament from Kairana twice, she has also won the District Panchayat election from Shamli
 philhal ek baar phir ve bijepi or congress ko sapa-basapa or ralod gathbandhan kii ore se takkar dene utari hai
 Eight Lok Sabha seats in western Uttar Pradesh are to be voted on April 11, of which one is Kairana Lok Sabha seat
 is seat se kul 13 ummidavaar kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Although Tabassum Hasan won the RLD ticket in the Kairana by-election held in 2018, but immediately before the tickets were announced, she left the RLD and went to the SP and is now in the fray as an SP candidate
 kairana main palaayan kaa mudda bhi nahin aayaa kamkairana main jat or muslim voter haaavee hai
 By-elections were held in May 2018
 jab chunaav ladane kii baat ai to vipaksh ne ekta dikhaate hue bijepi ke khilaaf sanyukt ummidavaar utaara
 Under gorakhpur-phulpur formula, Tabassum Hassan got the chance and Mriganka Singh, daughter of Hukum Singh was fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party
 lekin bijepi kaa yah imotional card nahin chal sakaa
 Hindutva agenda was not successful
 upachunaav se pehle or vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan kairana main palaayan ke mudde ne kaaphi surkhiyaan batorin
 In the 2017 assembly elections, this issue was also heavily discounted
 kairana loksabhaa seat kaa samikarnakairana loksabhaa seat pashchimi uttar pradesh ko prabhavit karne vaali seat he
 According to 2014 figures, there were a total of 15,31,755 voters on this seat
 inamen 8,40,623 purush or 6,91,132 mahila voter thim
 In 2018 by-election, 4389 votes were cast on NOTA on this seat
 kairana loksabhaa kshetra main kul 5 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Four out of five assembly seats went to the Bharatiya Janata Party's account
 inamen nakud bijepi, gangoh bijepi, kairana bijepi, thana bhawan bijepi, shamali bijepi ke khate main hi gai thim
 The results of the 2018 by-election were Bassam Hasan, Rashtriya Lok Dal, with a total of 481182 Mriganka Singh, Bharatiya Janata Party, with 436564 votes
 ralod kii tabassum ne bijepi kii mriganka singh ko 44618 voton se maat di thi
 What was the equation in the 2014 elections, let us tell you that before 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party was able to win this seat only once, but in the last Lok Sabha election, BJP got the benefit of Modi wave here
 yahaan se chunaav lade hukum singh ko kul 50 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki unke saamne khadey samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar ko 29 or bahujan samaaj party ke ummidavaar ko 14 fisadi hi vot mil paae the
 Hukum Singh won here with three lakh votes
 kairana ne dikhaaya gathbandhan kaa rasta2014 main kendra main narendra modi kii aguwai main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad se hi kai rajyon main bhartiya janata party ne jeet darj kii
 In 2017, when the BJP won an overwhelming majority in Uttar Pradesh, the support base of the SP-BSP was hurt
 gorakhpur-phulpur ke upachunaav main jab sapa-basapa ne ek hokar bijepi ko maat di to kairana main bhi vipakshi partiyon kaa bal mila
 Under the agreement, the RLD candidate got a chance
 samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, congress or aam aadmi party ne tabassum ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya
 Since then, the message was that the bjp's Modi magic in the country can be fought by the Grand Alliance
 is baar kaa muqabla bhi aisa hi hone vaala he
 Though the Congress is also contesting with full power, it is said that the real contest is between the SP-BSP and rld's joint alliance vs
 BJP
 bijepi ne pradeep choudhary par lagaaya daanv2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke hukum singh ne kairana seat se baaji maari thi
 But in the by-elections held after his death, this seat managed to win the RLD with the support of the SP
 areldi ke tikat par tabassum hasan ne bijepi kii ummidavaar mriganka singh ke khilaaf 44618 voton se jeet darj kii thi
 The BJP has played bets on a new face this time
 mriganka singh kii jagah, gangoh se vidhayak pradeep choudhary par daanv lagaaya he
 Pradeep Chaudhary has been a three-time MLA from Nakur and Gangoh
 gurjar samudaay se taalluk rakhane vaale pradeep areldi, congress or samaajawaadee party main bhi rah chuke hai
 Pradeep Chaudhary joined BJP in 2016 and in 2017 he was elected MLA from Gangoh
 jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se is seat par sabase zyada 5 lakh muslim matadaata hai
 While around 4 lakh backward (including Jat, Gurjar, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati and others) are voters
 kairana seat kaa itihasapashchimi uttar pradesh kii kairana loksabhaa seat raajnneetik lihaaj se kaaphi ahm seat he
 This Lok Sabha seat came into existence in 1962
 pehle hi chunaav main is seat se nirdaleey ummidavaar ne jeet darj kii thi
 After this the Socialist Party, Janata Party and Congress remained with this seat
 lekin 1996 main is seat par samaajawaadee party ne jeet darj kii, 1998 main bhartiya janata party, phir lagaataar do baar rashtriya lok dal, 2009 main bahujan samaaj party or 2014 main bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 When the by-elections were held in 2018, the BJP faced defeat

 Musicians and lyricists are demanding their rights as royalty from music companies
 inamen javed akhtar or sonu nigam jaisi hastiyaan shaamil hai
 Music companies, on the other hand, have their own arguments
 in sabake bich kai sansthaaen hai, jo copirite kii hifaazat yaa sangeet ko istemaal karne waalon ko license detii hai or vahaan se paise ikatthe karti hai
 These include the name of PPL and IPRS

 These institutions are frustrated with this

 According to those who use music without a license, it is not necessary to pay for the promotion of music
 pipiel or ipiares copirite sosayadi pehle thim
 They have not applied for fresh registration after the change in the copyright law, so there is no need to pay them now
 duusari taraf pipiel or ipiares ke mutabik unhone khud ko copirite sosayadi ke rup main registerd nahin karaayaa he, magar ab privet company ke rup main apane kaary ko anjaam de rahi hai
 Earlier these institutions were working under section / section 33 of 'copyright Act' and now under section / section 30
 baharhaal, in sansthaaon kaa karporate dhaancha bhale hi badla ho, magar sachai yahi he ki pipiel or ipiares aaj bhi kuch shrenee ke sangeet kii maalik hai
 Recently, on a petition filed by IPRS, the court of Chandigarh has ordered that under Section 30 of the Copyright Act, IPRS owns and can issue licenses for music and literary works
 adaalat ne aayojakon ko aadesh diya ki saarvajanik sthanon par sangeet bajaane ke liye vah ipiares se license hasil karen
 Similarly, an order has come on the plea of PPL that under Section 30, PPL will give license to play music
 tippaniyan Recently, Delhi High Court has passed an interim order against Kaushik Kothari, the owner of Golden Greats Orchestra, for violating copyright law, but he is not ready to follow the law
 in sab pachadon kii vajah se ipiares kaa galat prachaar bhi ho rahaa he, jisaki vajah se yah sansthaaen pareshaan hai

 Two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the 182-meter-tall Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat, the news came that Yogi would build a 151-meter-high copper statue of Lord Ram on the banks of Saryu in Ayodhya
 patel kii pratimaa main lohe kaa zyada istemaal hua he
 Yogishukar also visited Gujarat to see the statue of Sardar Patel
 aise main in kayaason ko bal mil rahaa he ki yogi sadhe paanv modi se kadam mila rahe hai
 After becoming CM, there was a time when Yogi's discussion was more in the media than Modi
 yogi kab uthte hai, kab puja karte hai, yahaan tak ki kya khate hai isaki bhi jaankaree or photo baahar aane lagi thi
 The media argued that people wanted to know more about Yogi
 siem banane ke baad yogi ne dauron kii jhadi laga di thi, upi main kaman haath main lete hi krime ke aankadon main bhi kami dekhe jane lagi
 After this, the encounter policy brought Yogi into the discussion in Hindi speaking states
 sutron ke mutabik badhate kad ko dekhte hue alaakaman kii taraf se yogi tak yah sandesh pahunchaa diya gaya ki zyada tej chalanaa thik nahin he
 After this, Yogi also reduced his speed but now it is believed that now gradually he is going to strengthen his grip
 wo koun si khaasiyaten hai jo yogi ko modi ke saamne khadaa karti hai, daalate hai ek najar
 Hindutva, a big identity made of Hindutva, recognized both leaders
 modi par bhale hi gujarat dangon ke aarope lage lekin janamanas main is dharna ko bal mila ki yahi aadmi hinduon kii raksha kar saktaa he
 Yogi got the blessings of Gorakshpeeth, Mahant Avaidyanath, who has been a Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur many times, declared him his successor
 siem banane se pehle hi purvi upi main log maanane lage the yogi ke rahete hindu surakshit he
 Even today, Yogi has managed to retain this image
 fire brands netamodi ko jis tarah bijepi kaa fire brands netaa mana jaataa he usee tarah yogi ke bare main bhi dharna bani hui he
 While in the government, the Yogi may have reduced the fire, but those who have heard the speech of the Yogi while in opposition, remember how he used to make the public happy with his speeches in the same way
 Modi used to do it
 aaj bhi yogi sabhaaon main apana alag rang dikhaa dete hai
 The slogans were how our PM should be, how our CM used to raise voice for Modi during the elections, how should be our PM, in the same way, in the election meetings of UP, the slogans used to be how our CM should be
 logon ke bich se hi jawaab aata tha ki yogi jaisaa ho
 However, given the caste equations, the BJP did not project any face in UP
 lekin alaakaman tak yah baat pahunch gai thi ki agar hindutv ko lekar aage badhanaa he to yogi ko hi aage karnaa hoga
 Both do 16 hours
kamodi is said to work 16 hours every day, Yogi is said to sleep only 4 hours, just as Modi gives time to yoga, in the same way Yogi worships And pay attention
 donon ke paas parivaar nahin he, jitna bhi samay he vah desh or pradesh ke liye he
 Both are vigilant about their branding, Modi is famous for his attire, in the same way that Yogi is a saffron, saffron is seen everywhere from kurtas to chairs
 star prachaarkkisi bhi pradesh main chunaav ho rahaa ho rahaa he sabase pehali demand modi kii hoti he usee tarah pradesh main sabase zyada demand yogi kii hoti he
 After the formation of the government in UP, Yogi has been called in the states where elections or by-elections have been held
 yogi kaa kad kis tarah se bad rahaa he iskaa udhaaharan chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ke saath unki photo he jisamen bataaya gaya ki unhone yogi kaa pair chhukar chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruuaat kii
 In the by-election for the parliament seats in UP, Modi's absence for campaigning and Yogi's whole life were also taken apart
 raajnneetik samikshakon kaa kahana he agar modi nahin jate hai to jeet nahin milane vaali yah dikhaane ke liye modi nahin gaye
 However, some people also say that PM has been avoiding campaigning in the by-elections
 vahiin yogi ne jamkar prachaar kiya, lekin haar ke baad bhi kahin mahasoos nahin hone diya ki yah unki haar he
 Development The biggest identity of the people came to power as an example that development is the biggest issue in the country
 siem rahete hue unhone gujarat ko ek model kii tarah pesh kiya
 With his speeches, Modi was successful in convincing the people of the country that if the BJP comes to power, a glow like Gujarat will be seen in the entire country
 yogi ne sapa ke kushasan ko apana mudda banaaya, ek kattar netaa kii chhavi banaae rakhte hue bhi alaakaman tak yah sandesh pahunchane main safal rahe ki unamem upi ko vikaas kii raah par le jane kaa madda he
 Both are trying to live up to their promises
 google par sabase zyada search kiye gaye yogiyogi aaj ke samay main sabase zyada daura karne vaale mukhyamantri hai, aankade bataate hai ki mukhyamantriyon main wo google main sabase zyada search kiye jate hai
 That is, their identity is getting bigger in public
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki agar vah bhagwaan ram kii 151 meter oonchi pratimaa banavaane main safal rahe to unka kad ooncha hona tay he
 The height of the statue has increased by 51 meters in a year
 Last year, the Yogi government announced a plan to install a 100 meter tall statue of Lord Rama
 tab 'navy ayodhya' yojana ke tahat dharmik paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye yogi sarkaar ne rajyapal ram nik ko prapojal bhi dikhaaya tha
 But this plan did not materialize in a year
 sawaal uth rahe hai aakhir ek saal main murti kii oonchai 51 meter kyon badhaani pad gai
 Was it done because there are more statues of such height that it was a bit difficult to come into the discussion
 kya patel kii murti ko dekhakar yogi ne iraadaa badal diya he
 Before the announcement of Modi's name in 2014, there were many names among the contenders for the post of PM
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke bare main kaha gaya ki unamem sabko lekar chalane kii kshamta he
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh even said that if the party entrusts him with responsibility, then he is ready
 lekin aaj agar modi kii lokapriyata ke aage kisi siem kii baat hoti he to yogi ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa

 ritesh garg se milen
 Ritesh Garg, a management professional and a high scholar from Banaras University, is the founder of 'I for Nation Foundation'
 rudki ke mangalore nivasee ritesh garg kaa maananaa he ki unnati or naukari ke liye apane gaanv ko chhodane kii jarurat nahin he
 There is a lot we can do by staying in the village
 aaj ritesh ko duniyabar ke log jaanate hai
 They inspire people all over the world to come back to the village and work there
 iske liye unhen kai aword se sammanit bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 Let's know about the journey of Ritesh's success
 
 
 - 26 varsh ritesh garg 'ai for nesan foundation' ke jariye gaanvon se palaayan rokte hai
 Today, more than 35 people have started startups taking their inspiration
 - UPSC kaa exam teen baar crack kiya or mahaj teen maheene kii taiyaari main CAT main 95 percentaile se paas hue11 bhashaaon main film banaakar ginis book of world record main banaai jagah- banaras uniwarsity se emb karne ke baad jaipur rags ke saath soshal sector main kaam kiya, jahaan unhone 65 gaanvon main kaam kiya
 After Jaipur Rugs, Ritesh worked as an operational manager at Tata Jagriti Yatra, where he got to know the problems and issues of the regional people
 isi bich unki bank pio kii job bhi mili
 But he also left that job
 - tata jagriti yatra se unhen ek baat samaj aa gai ki agar kshetreey sansadhano or yuvaaon ko mila diya jaae to usase bahut bade badlaav kiye ja sakate hai or kai kshetreey samasyaon ko suljhaayaa bhi ja saktaa he
 This is why Ritesh got the inspiration for 'prerna Yatra'
 - ritesh isi prerana yatra ke jariye yuvaaon ko apana kaarobaar shuru karne kii prerana dete hai
 Sai's flight could not stop the lifeless feet, many records have been made 'yuva Prerna Yatra' Every year, 'I for Nation Foundation', on April 3, the Youth Prerna Yatra starts from Doon University
 is yatra main sirf wo log shaamil hote hai, jinke andar kuch karne kii kshamta ho
 The special thing is that the 100-member yatra is attended by the iitians to the illiterate village head
 is yatra main logon ko kaarobaar shuru karne se sambandhit sari jaankaree di jaati he
 Demonetisation: UGC is running cashless and digital transaction campaign sajid-waajid film'jai ho' , 'main tera hero', 'daavat-e-ishk' jaisi filmon ke superhit mujeec ke baad ab film 'tevar' ke femesasang ke liye surkhiyaan bator rahe he
 The song 'superman Salman Ka Fan' is very much liked by music lovers
 is gane kaa mukhdaa sajid ne likhaa or waajid ne ise gaaya he
 Exclusive conversation with sajid-wajid, the creator of Tabartod songs: The songs of 'tevar' are very much liked? The film 'tevar' is very special for us
 boni kapur ke saath hamane 'wonted' jaisi superhit film or 'tevar' se arjuna kapur apni pehali home production film ke liye kaam kar rahe hai isaliye ham sabane film ke mujeec par bahut dhyaan diya he
 We had prepared the song 'superman' long ago, when the story of the film was being told to us, then everyone first liked this song
 film main yah gaanaa hero kaa entry song he
 There was a news in the past that there was a controversy over the voice of Wajid and Mika Singh for the song 'superman' of the film? It is true that we have recorded this song in the voice of Mica Singh too, but whose song in the film's song Awaaz Raheeni was a creative decision that we took together with producer Boney Kapoor and director Anuj Sharma
 vaise is gane kaa ek or varjan jo mika singh kii aawaaj main hafilm ke credit tital main shaamil kiya gaya he
 The season of the awards will come, how eager are you? Our songs are liked by youngsters and people of all ages, so that is our award, and even if we get the awards, it becomes an even bigger thing
 abhi aamir khan ke tivi sho main aapke gane 'fevicol se' ko ashleel bataaya gaya, aap isse ittefaq rakhte hai?ji hamen nahin lagata kii us geet main koi ashleelata he, agar aap geet ke bol padhein yaa sunen to aapako pataa chal jayega ki wo ek dancer ke khyaal hai jise wo bayaan kar rahi he or vaise bhi bahut saare ashleel gane aate hai,unke bich ye gaanaa kisi bhi tarah se ashleel nahin he, hamaari koshish hoti darshakon ko thirakane par majaboor karen, na kii ashleelata failaaen,hamaare ghar main bhi maa betiyaan hai
 What is Salman Khan for you? Big brother, and not only for us, who are also young actors like Arjun Kapoor, Varun Dhawan, they all consider him as their ideal
 sangeet kya he aap donon ke liye?sangeet hamaari jindagi he
 If you are not a listener of your songs? If you are not a listener, funky has no value, we would have been zero
 jab koi geet nahin chalata to kya soch hoti he aapaki?har vakt ek sa nahin hota, to kabhi kabhi acchhee chijen bhi jaaya ho jaati he
 Upcoming films your? As you know right now 'tevar' is coming, after that we have given music in the movie 'dolly Ki Doli'

 unhone apane post main produsar kaa bina naam liye likhaa, " unhone profeshnal note ke saath meraa intervyuu shuru kiya tha
 But soon he started talking about 'compromise' and 'one night'
 "A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay) on Apr 4, 2019 at 5:28am pdtsruwi marathe Shruti Marathe) ne aage kaha, " mujhe pataa tha ki main yah sab nahin kar sakati isliye maine manaa kar diya

 i told this meeting to many people, after which they suggested to me that i should leave this project
 " unhone likhaa, " us din yah sab hone ke naate nidar hone kaa ek minute tha
 i did not do all this for myself
 maine yah sab un sabhi mahilaon ke liye kiya he, jo in sab chizon se guzarati hai
 Women are immediately judged for what that is
 "shruti marathe (shruti Marathe) ne apni post main galat maansikta rakhane vaale abhinaytaon par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Actors live their lives very comfortably
 unhone aage bataaya ki internet se meri ek puraani tasviir nikaal lee gai jo bikni main thi
 This picture of me was from an old South film
 yah sab meri ek tivi sho kii lokapriyata ke baad hua
 i agreed to film the bikini scene without thinking, because getting a role in the film was also a big deal
 is seen ke baad mujhe kaaphi trol kiya gaya
 But do you know how much it hurts confidence
 shruti marathe (shruti Marathe) kaa yah post khub viral ho rahaa he

 swara bhaskar film industry main sabase jaagruk actress main gini jaati hai

 He cautioned everyone to be concerned about this issue and also told how they are trying to conserve resources
 swara ne twitor acount par kuch photose share kii hai
 With this, he wrote in the caption, "we have to take small steps from our side to protect the climate crisis that is currently going on
" isamen puraane kapadon ko ricycle karnaa bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 i am also trying to do something like this
 main apni nani kii puraani saadiyon se pant-suut banaakar uskaa istemaal kar rahi hum
 Needless to say that climate change has emerged as a major problem not only in the country but in the world
 aisa andeshaa lagaaya ja rahaa he ki aane vaale samay main sthiti or bhi gambhir hone vaali he
 An example of this can be the heavy rains occurring at different places without weather
 With the current climate crisis, i think we can all do our small bit, to conserve our resources in the personal choices we make
 Recycling & up cycling old clothes is one such means
 Im trying to do the same by up-cyclying one of my late nani’s old saris into a pant suit

 tochi raina, sufi gayak In the current politics, when the gap between 'differences' and 'discrimination' is getting erased, politicians need to learn from the country's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru how to keep political differences separate from relationships

 In such an environment, political issues were openly discussed and they were discussed healthy
 mishra ne ek udhaaharan dete hue bataaya, ‘congress se alag hone ke baad netaji subhaashachandr bose ne farward blaak kii sthapana kii or is dauraan unke evam nehru ke bich ke raajnneetik matbhed kisi se chhipe nahin he
 Meanwhile, in the early 40s, he came to Allahabad to inaugurate his party's city office
 unhone bataaya, ‘pandit nehru ko jab pataa chalaa ki subhash babu elahabaad aa rahe hai to unhone apane sachiv ko kaha ki netaji anand bhawan (nehru kaa paitruk awaas) ke mehmaan honge
 'mishra told Subhash Babu asked Padmakant Malviya, the city president of Forward Block,' i have no problem stopping at Anand Bhavan, you won't have any problem
 ’mishra ne bataaya ki malviya ne turant kaha, ‘anand bhawan meraa ghar he or maine use kabhi choda nahin he
 Describing a post-independence incident, Mishra said, "acharya Kripalani was one of the strongest opponents of the Congress and at the same time his wife Sucheta Kripalani was the Chief Minister of the state's Congress government in Uttar Pradesh
 ’chinoy ne kaha ki keval nehru hi nahin balki us daur kii raajnneeti main mahatma gandhi, moulana abul kalam aaazaad, shyama prasad mukherjee, ram manohar lohia jaise kaddavar netaaon kii raajnneeti main lambii fehrist thi, jinke kareeb tak vartmaan raajnneeti kii kisi bhi party kaa koi bhi netaa pahunch hi nahin saktaa he

 The Congress has started changing its strategy in view of the crushing defeat of BJP in elections across the country
 ab vah indira gandhi ke sahare aage bad rahi he
 After the massive victory of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Narendra Modi, due to the Congress's poor performance in the elections in different parts of the country continuously, now the Gujarat Congress has left the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, Indira Gandhi Has started with the help of darasal isi saal ke ant tak gujarat main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main congress apane astitv kii ladaai lard rahi he

 Now it will be interesting to see how much Rahul Gandhi attracts the traditional tribal voters following the footsteps of his grandmother
 supreme court ne kaha he ki shaareerik taur par aksham logon ko iees samet tamaam sarkari naukari or pramotion main teen fisadi aarakshan diya jaae
 Chief Justice RM Lodha said that a physically incapacitated person had not got the right in this case for 19 years despite the law made in 1995
 isse pehle bombai hai court ne bhi centre sarkaar or upiessi ko nirdesh diya tha ki vah iees ke appointment or pramotion main viklangon ke liye teen fisadi rigerveshan lagu kare
 The Center had moved the Supreme Court against this
 maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne centre ko fatkaar lagaai
 The High Court said that the Center is opposing this law and trying to foil its objective

 Abusive comments written on the statue of Swami Vivekananda, police filed by the Delhi Police have registered an FIR against the unknown for abusing the statue of Swami Vivekananda at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and damaging the statue
 vishvavidhyalay prashasan kii shikaayat par agyaat chaatro ke khilaaf exiaar darj kii gai he
 Explain that the statue of Swami Vivekananda in JNU and the building of JNU Admin Block was damaged by the students
 bataa den ki pehlejwaharlal nehru uniwarsity (jeenyu)main hostel kii fees badhane ke kaaran chaatro ne virodh-pradarshan kiya
 However, after the protests, the government did not keep the fees as before, but reduced it slightly
 hostel fees ke dhaanche main badlaav ke baavjood chaatro kaa gussa shant nahin hua he or chaatr ek baar phir prashasnic bhawan main ghuse or hangaamaa kiya
 Meanwhile some mischievous elements made lewd comments on the statue of Swami Vivekananda
 aapattijanak naare likhe gaecanpus main kapade se dhakkar rakhi gai vikekanand kii murti ke aasapaas aapattijanak naare likhe gaye the
 Slogans were also written against the VC on the walls
 bataa den ki yah murti janvari main prashasan kii ore se laagai gai thi, lekin ab tak iskaa anaavaran nahin hua he
 The JNU Students' Union said that this incident is trying to divert attention from the movement
 enesayuai adhyaksh sani dhimaan ne is ghatana kii ninda karte kaha tha ki mujhe nahin lagata he ki jeenyu kaa koi bhi chaatr aisa kar saktaa he
 He said that the statue was not damaged but something was written on it
 haalanki ab hamane ise saaf kar diya he
 The ABVP accused the statue of damage, while the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) alleged that there was an attempt to damage the statue of the non-unveiled Vivekananda in JNU
 bataa den ki is murti ke aasapaas bijepi ko lekar kai slogan likhe the
 However, the administration cleared it
 abivipi ne kaha ki saarvajanik sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaana left chaatr sanghathanon kaa maansik diwaliyapan dikhaata he
 ABVP JNU unit president Durgesh Kumar said that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had already pointed out that activists associated with leftist student organizations like ISA, SFI, DSF, AISF underestimated their petty political interests under the guise of the JNU movement Are not meant by the university
 akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke pradesh mantri siddharth yadav ne kaha ki swami vivekanand ne aadhunik bharat ko disha dikhaane main behad mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, unhen kisi vaicharik khaanche main baitaakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 But the manner in which the people of the Left tried to damage his statue is very unfortunate

 The Special Task Force (STF) probing the scam had registered an FIR against Yadav on February 24 in connection with the fraud in the Forest Guard Recruitment Examination-2013 under sections of Fraud and Prevention of Corruption Act
 maamle main anya 87 logon ko bhi aaropee banaaya gaya he
 However, a fortnight ago, after the FIR was registered against the Governor's son Shailesh Yadav in the Vyapam scam and the arrest of his OSD Dhananjay Yadav in the same case, the Raj Bhavan started getting involved in Vyapam's flames
 centre sarkaar ne 85 varshiya yadav ko sanket de die the ki behatar hoga ki ve khud hi istipha de den, taaki unhen barkhaast karne kii naubat na aae
 If sources are to be believed, a strong case is being made against the governor in this case
 estf ne unke khilaaf jo saboot jutaaye hai, unamem rajbhavan se kiye kol ditels or esemes ke alaava rajyapal ke letterhed par likhe gaye sifarishi patr bhi shaamil hai
 The governor is accused of using his influence to recruit two forest guards
 rajbhavan ke kriyalap se parichit sutron kii maane to yadav apane bete shailesh ke kaaran sankat main hai
 Yadav may be a Khanty Congressman and has been the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in the Congress government, but Shailesh had increased his closeness with BJP leaders by sensing the wind
 bhopal ke rajnatik galiyaaron main is baat kii charchaa thi ki ve jald hi bijepi main shaamil ho jaaenge
 Allegedly, there were allegations that Shailesh was continuously misusing the Raj Bhavan in transfer-posting to universities and other posts
 satta ke centre vallabh bhawan ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, ''rajbhavan se rajyapal mahoday ke dastakhat vaale kai sifarishi patr hamaare yahaan bhi aae
 No recommended leader or person sitting on the post of Governor would make such a recommendation as was recommended in these letters
 ab lagata he ki shailesh yaa unke oesady hi rajyapal se is tarah ke patron par dastakhat kara rahe the
 "anyway, apart from hearing high, many diseases occurring in old age surround them
 vidhansabha ke bajet satr main abhibhaashan ko padhane ke liye bhi unhen do log pakadakar dise tak le gaye the
 This is the first time in the entire political life of Yadav, wearing a Gandhi cap over a white dhoti-kurta, when he is facing such serious charges
 isiilie exiar darj hone ke pehle ek bayaan main unhone kaha tha, ''mere 52 saal ke rajnatik jivan main kabhi koi daag nahin laga
 i do not even have my own house
 '' lekin shaayad unhen pataa nahin tha ki unke naam kii sifarishi chitthiyaan unke budhaape ko kharaab karne vaali hai
 By the way, Yadav was constantly trying not to resign
 unhone kaaphi had tak madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko bhi is baat ke liye manaa liya tha ki bajet satr ke bich main to kam se kam unhen na janaa pade
 If sources are to be believed, Chauhan also advocated the Governor in a conversation with Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 lekin rajnath ne spasht kar diya ki exiar hone ke baad sarkaar kisi surat main yadav ko pad par dekhnaa nahin chaahati
 Anyway, there is no point in saving the governor appointed by the Congress government after being accused of corruption
 iske alaava bijepi hikeman ne yah bhi dekha ki rajyapal ko bhrashtachar ke maamle main hataakar mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii ore tani vyapam ghotaale kii top kaa munh congress kii taraf modaa ja saktaa he
 In fact, the FIR has been lodged against the Governor at a time when Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh in his affidavit submitted to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the High Court directly accused Chauhan of involvement in the Vyapam scam and recommending 42 appointments
 
 iske pehle mukhyamantri ke pie rahe prem narayan ke khilaaf ghotaale main exiar ho chuki he
 Laxmikant Sharma, who was the Minister of Higher Education in the Shivraj government, is already in jail
 ghotaale ke sutaradhar or shishu mandir ke shikshak se jaguaar car main farrata bharne tak kaa safar tay karne vaale sudhir sharma bhi isi maamle main jail main hai
 Digvijay has even alleged that Shivraj added the names of Raj Bhavan, Uma Bharti and others to the Excel seat to protect himself and the same tampered Excel sheet was submitted to the Jabalpur High Court
 yah sara ghatnakram mil kar teesraa kaarykaal sambhaal rahe chouhan ke liye bada sir dard ban gaya tha
 That is why initially Chauhan was afraid that if the governor had to go due to the charges, tomorrow, similar charges will demand sacrifice of his chair
 sutron kii maane to rajnath ne mukhyamantri ko samajhaayaa ki rajyapal kii vidaai isliye tay he kyonki unke khilaaf exiar hui he or estf ko pukhta saboot mili hai, jabaki mukhyamantri ke khilaaf lag rahe aaropon kii prakruti naitik zyada he
 The Chief Minister's attitude changed after the highman's hand on his shoulder
 unhone vidhansabha main congress ko chunauti di, ''himmat he to suno shivaraj ko, dam he to suno shivaraj ko
 Chauhan dismissed Digvijay Singh's allegations outright
 mukhyamantri karyaalay ke sutron kaa kahana he ki siem kii sifarish vaale 42 naamon kii excel shit farji he
 "one of the original excel sheets submitted in the High Court was empty," said an officer close to the chief minister
 congress netaaon ne yahi shit bharkar sara bakheda khadaa kiya he
 The investigation will reveal this and the accused will have a case of 400 BC
 ''lekin jis kursi par aaj chouhan baithe hai, unase pehle 10 saal tak us kursi par baith chuke digvijay ne kaha, ''estf puri tarah mukhyamantri ke ishaare par kaam kar rahi he
 STF submitted the details of the tampered SMS to the High Court
 ab hamane asli excel shit di he
 If i am lying then sue me
 '' esaity ko saunpe patr main digvijay ne ek darjan se adhik phone numberon kii kol dilate nikaalane kaa aagrah kiya he
 These phone numbers belong to many people including CM House, Chauhan and his wife Sadhana Singh, associated with him Prashant Srivastava, Harish, Vasant Bhargava
 vyapam ke ek visal blower ne india today ko bataaya, ''in numberon main aise 5,000 esemes kaa byoraa he jo mukhyamantri karyaalay se jude logon ne vyapam ghotaale ke silsile main kiye
 "that is, it is the turn of the big fish in the scam that has canceled 1,365 medical admissions and government appointments
" rajyapal kii kursi par to inamen se mahaj do niyuktiyaan karaane ke aarope hi ban ai, jab baaki kii 1,363 siton kaa chittha khulegaa to vyapam aaj se kahin vyapak dikhaai degaa
 We saw in the theater a living proof of the kind of atmosphere created by the politics of hate and incidents of mob lynching
 mahasoos kiya ki bantwaare kii ek diwaar paraspar avishvaas kii neenv par kitni majboot or oonchi hoti ja rahi he
 It is also seen that the dress and appearance are deciding things
 kaise?darasal, is weekend ham kuch dost milakar cinema dekhne kii yojana bana rahe the
 We had a lot of options
 chaar achche vikalp
 When your favorite actors have many films in a single week, it becomes very difficult to choose one film
 ham doston ke saamne bhi aise hi halaat the
 We had to choose between Anil kapoor-rajkumar Rao and Aishwarya's "fanney Khan" Irrfan's "caravan" and Rishi kapoor-taapsee Pannu's performance
 main peshey se ek patrkaar hum, swaabhaavik taur par samvedansheel chijen prathamdrishtya aakarshith karti hai
 The way 'mulk' was discussed in all three films, we decided to watch it
 haalanki hamaare kuch doston ne apni ruchiyon ke hisaab se duusari filmon ko tarjeeh di
 Accompanied by a Muslim friend, he reached the multiplex in East Delhi to see 'mulk'
 mere dost ne genes or shart pahana hua tha jabaki maine kaale rang kaa pathaani suut
 Before entering the theater, i had not even imagined the things mentioned above
 lekin andar jis tarah kaa maahaul mila, dress kii vajah se ek ashanka ko lekar main lagbhag asahaj ho gaya
 Unconvinced by the slogans in the cinema hall, we noticed that a group of 10-20 boys had also reached the theater to watch the film
 rajdhani ke padhe-likhe ladakon kaa samooh
 No mob lynching
 theatre main raashtragan baja
 Both of us also stood as a grateful citizen and honored the national anthem
 film shuru hui
 We found that two policemen are sitting behind (at the back) our seat in the theater
 laga- "hamaari tarah wo bhi film dekhne aae honge
 "those who have not seen 'country' should know its story briefly
 darasal, ye banaras ke ek aise muslim parivaar kii kahani he jo aatankwaad ko lekar dharmik aadhaar par saamaajik-prashasnic pratadna jhel rahaa he
 The custom, dress, and beard of the clothes are questioned on its entire existence
 lekin aakhir main unki nyaayik jeet hoti he
 The film depicts a blast in Allahabad
 peshey se vakil muraad ali (rishi kapur) ke parivaar ke ladke shahid mohammad (pratik babbar) kaa encounter kar diya jaataa he
 At the time this scene was shown, slogans like 'bharat Mata Ki Jai', 'pakistan Murdabad' were raised in the theater
 mujhe thik-thik yaad nahin ki aakiri baar rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke kisi multiplex main koi film dekhte hue theatre main is tarah kii hooting se meraa saamana hua ho
 My beautiful clean-shaved friend was upset with the boys' sloganeering
 main bhi
 Because, 'we came to see the film and not to show our personal patriotism
 ' hamen naaron se aapatti nahin thi, lekin isaki vajah se film ke saath jo nirantarata tut rahi thi wo zyada pareshaan karne vaali thi
 We do not mind that other people present in the theater expressed their displeasure over this
 tokaa bhi
 Since the film was on a subject that was against the ideology of a large conservative and staunch group, the prohibition had no effect until the end and whenever he felt the need to demonstrate personal patriotism through a film scene, he nonchalantly Through kis baat kaa dar jo suraksha ke liye maujuud thi police?jab interval hua, ham kautuhalvash kone main baithe do pulicekarmiyon ke paas pahunch gaye
 We asked- Have you also come to see the film? His answer was- 'no
 ham yahaan suraksha ke lihaaj se hai
 There is no high and low, so our duty is on
 ' hamane sawaal kiya- phir aapako logon ko narebaaji rukvaani chahie? unka sidhaa jawaab tha- "hamane to koi narebaaji suni nahin
 Our job is to prevent any fighting and fighting
 "pulicekarmiyon se baatcheet ke baad ham yahi sochate rahe ki - kya mulk itani samvedansheel film he jise dikhaane ke liye pulicekarmiyon kii jarurat pad rahi he? meraa dost muslim jabaki main hindu
 But personally i was more upset because of the dress
 afvaahon se upajane vaala dar
 One apprehension
 khaufmere kaale pathaani sootaka
 Worry- my beard-mustache grew lighter on my face
 is maahaul main pahanaave kii vajah se meraa dost mujhe zyada surakshit lag rahaa tha
 While he was Muslim
 is film ko dekhte hue mujhe aisa laga desh main kis tarah se 'pahchaan' ek sankat ke taur par pukhta ho chukaa he
 i was afraid that if i would object to the noise and sloganeering of the Muslim character of the country, then i could be beaten or abused without knowing my identity
 ant main is court room drama ne un tamaam sawaalon kaa makul jawaab diya jo narebaaji ke shor main bhi puche ja rahe the
 The country is not a sensitive film like this but it is the time and politics of today which is needed by the policemen to show it
 desh main dar kaa koharaa ghanaa ho rahaa he

 com / f0m8n69awr (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In Uttar Pradesh, anti-incumbency seems to be gaining momentum against Yogi Adityanath
 india today group ke liye exis maai india kii ore se ekatra political stock exange (PSE) data ke mutabik uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii lokapriyata main beete 3 maheene main khaasi giravat ai he
 Comparing the popularity of Yogi, who has been in power for almost two years, with Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh as Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh from the last days of the third term, it looked 6% less
 ab jabaki bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke liye qamar kas rahi he to aise main uttar pradesh main bijepi ke khilaaf asantosh kaa ooncha graph centre main sattarudh party ke liye taaja sirdard kaa kaaran banataa nazar aa rahaa he
 Yogi Adityanath's popularity was 43% in the first tracking poll conducted by Axis for India Today in September
 bijepi samarthakon ke liye niraashajanak baat ye he ki exis kii ore se karaae gaye taaja survey main yogi kii lokapriyata beete teen maheene main 5% neeche aa chuki he
 In the PSE survey conducted in the third week of December, only 38% of the participants said that Yogi Adityanath was their first choice for the next CM
 vahiin samaajawaadee party ke pramukh akhilesh yadav, jinaki lokapriyata sitambar main PSE ke mutabik 29% par tiki thi wo beete teen maheenon main 8% badhkar disambar main 37% tak pahunch gai
 After Akhilesh's surge in popularity, he is now 1% behind Yogi Adityanath
 vahiin bispi supremeo kii lokapriyata main sitambar se disambar ke bich 3% kii giravat ai he
 Mayawati's popularity was 18% in September, which declined to 15% in December
 yogi adityanath ke khilaaf asantosh ke str ko acchhee tarah tabhi samajha ja saktaa he jab uttar pradesh ke PSE aankadon kii tulana madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke aankadon se kii jaae, jahaan haal main hi vidhansabha chunaav hue
 In November's PSE data, 44% of the participants named Shivraj Singh Chauhan as their first choice as the next Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh
 itane hi pratibhaagiyon ne raman singh ko chhattisgarh main bataur agle mukhyamantri apni pasand bataaya tha
 As far as Rajasthan is concerned, in November, 31% of the participants said that Vasundhara Raje was the most preferred candidate for another term of Chief Minister
 iskaa arth he ki yogi adityanath kii lokapriyata madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main satta se baahar hue shivaraj singh chouhan or raman singh kii lokapriyata se 6% kam rahi
 Yogi Adityanath appeared ahead of Vasundhara Raje's popularity in the last days of his tenure as Chief Minister in Rajasthan
 dikkat akele yogi adityanath tak hi simit nahin he
 Dissatisfaction against the functioning of the Uttar Pradesh government is also increasing rapidly
 PSE ke taaja survey main hissaa lene vaale 35% pratibhaagiyon ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bijepi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se wo puri tarah asantusht hai
 Only 37% of the participants said that they are fully satisfied with the functioning of this government
 yani puri tarah santusht or puri tarah asantusht votaron main antar sirf 2% tak neeche aa gaya he
 9% of voters said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 12% said they were somewhat satisfied
 exis maai india kii ore se PSE survey 14 disambar se 19 disambar ke bich kiya gaya
 During this time telephone interviews were conducted in 80 parliamentary constituencies of Uttar Pradesh
 isamen 31,200 pratibhaagiyon ne hissaa liya
 This sample represented the population and geographical location of Uttar Pradesh
 PSE data se un muddon ko baariki se janaa ja saktaa he jinhen voter 2019 chunaav main vot karne ke liye sabase ahm bataa rahe hai
 32% of the survey participants cited unemployment as the most important issue
 vahiin 21% votaron kii nazar main mahangaai sabase ahm mudda he
 Issues related to farming and farmers are of paramount importance for 17% of the participants
 vahiin hindu-muslim dwandv ko sirf 9% pratibhaagiyon ne hi ahm bataaya
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been accused of polarizing the recent elections in the state on communal grounds
 PSE data se sanket miltaa he ki gorakhpur ke bahubali yogi kii ore se praathamiktaayen galat tay hui ho sakati hai
 Not only is the dismal functioning of the state government a matter of concern for the BJP, but the growing support for the opposition alliance is also a problem for it
 PSE survey main hissaa lene vaale kareeb aadhe pratibhaagiyon (47%) ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress ko bijepi ke khilaaf ladaai main ekajute hona chahie
 28% of the participants expressed their opinion against any such grand alliance
 vahiin survey main hissaa lene vaale ek-chauthai pratibhaagi koi spasht raay vyakt nahin kar sake ki vipakshi mahagathbandhan hona chahie yaa nahin
 The PSE data does not give an estimate of seats and votes, but it gives a clear indication of where the wind is blowing in India's most sensitive state
 agar satta main doosraa saal puraa karne se pehle hi kisi sarkaar kii lokapriyata 40% se neeche aa jaati he to bijepi ke liye rajya main acchhee khabar nahin he
 The only relief for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed to increase his own popularity in the last three months
 sitambar main 48% pratibhaagiyon ne modi ko pradhanmantri ke taur par ek or kaarykaal dene ke paksh main raay vyakt kii thi
 In the survey conducted in December, 51% people said that Modi is the preferred candidate for PM
 ye apane aap main bahut myne rakhata he ki anti inkmbency kaa pradhanmantri par koi asar nahin dikhaai detaa
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's popularity has also increased by 4% in the last three months
 sitambar main rahul kii lokapriyata 22% thi jo disambar main bad kar 26% ho gai
 However, Rahul's supporters are excited that his acceptance is increasing
 lekin asaliyat ye he ki ab bhi lokapriyata ke maamle main narendra modi or rahul gandhi ke bich 25% kaa bada antar he
 Which means the next Prime Minister? Modi is ahead of Rahul on the question of centre sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko lekar bhi waisi hi logon main majboot avadharana he jaise ki sarkaar kii aguai karne vaale netaa ko lekar he
 52% of PSE survey participants say that they are fully satisfied with the functioning of the central government
 sirf 29% pratibhaagiyon ne kaha ki ve centre sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko lekar puri tarah asantusht hai
 This means that the number of voters who are happy about the functioning of the central government is 23% more than the voters who are not happy about this work
 bijepi kii sabase badi ummid pradhanmantri modi kii lokapriyata par tiki he jo ki upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton par party ke achche pradarshan main madad karegi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, BJP won 71 seats in the state
 jabaki do siton par bijepi ke sahyogi dal apana dal ko kamyaabi mili thi
 While the BJP will try its best to make the 2019 election a 'one to one' fight, the problem for the party is that the increasing level of anti-incumbency for the state government in Uttar Pradesh may cut some of the gains the central government has achieved
 2014 aam chunaav ke vakt bijepi naa centre kii satta main thi or naa hi upi kii satta main
 Therefore, bjp's prospects could not be shocked by the anti-incumbency trend
 lekin 2019 main paristhitiyaan bhi alag hongi or ladaai bhi alag, jab tak ki gorakhnath mandir ke mahant agle teen maheenon main apane raajnneetik bhagya ko jagaane ke liye koi naatakeey rasta nahin apanaate
 The government has planned to run KG to PG (kindergarten to post graduate) educational institutions in backward areas of the country

 The Naxalites of Odisha have decided to produce Biju Janata Dal (BJD) abducted legislator Jhina Hikka in their court on 25 April
 jabaki aisi afvaahen ud rahi thim ki naksali, vidhayak ko shuukravaar ko reeha kar denge
 Naxalites have said this in a new audio message sent to TV channels
 ek visheshgy kaa maananaa he ki naksali lakshmipur vidhansabha kshetra ke 37 varshiya vidhayak kii hatya to nahin karenge, kyonki vah janajati samudaay se hai or uske paas janajatiyon kaa acha khaasaa samarthan he, lekin aisa lagata he ki ve unase vidhansabha se istipha dene ke liye kah sakate hai
 The expert, on the condition of anonymity, said, 'they can also put forward some other demands
 ' gyaat ho ki hikaaka ko bhartiya communist party (maovadi) kii andhra-odisha seemaa vishesh kshetreey samiti ne koraput jile se 24 march ko agava kar liya tha
 The Naxalites are demanding the release of 29 prisoners in return for the release of Hikka, but the government has announced that only 13 prisoners will be released
 rajya sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki saat kaidi pehle hi apni jamaanat yachika daayar kar chuke hai or unamem se chaar ko jamaanat bhi mil chuki he
 Two more prisoners are also expected to be released soon
 haryana main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii jeet kaa daawa karte hue party kii pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh ram vilaas sharma ne kaha ki rajya kii janata ne nai, puraani har congress or uski prayek team ko ukhaad phenkane kaa man bana liya he or bijepi apane dam par sarkaar banaaegi
 Sharma said in a conversation with 'bhasha' that in the coming days there will be no place for new Congress, old Congress or any of its teams in Haryana
 rajya kii janata ne congress kii e team yaa bi team ko jad se ukhaad phenkane or bijepi ko puure bahumat ke saath janadesh dene kaa man bana liya he
 Claiming to form the government on its own in the state, the Haryana Pradesh BJP president said, "in Haryana, we contested 8 Lok Sabha seats and won seven of these seats
 agar ise vidhansabha siton ke rup main dekhen tab 72 vidhansabha siton main hamane 54 main jeet darj kii
 He said that in the assembly elections we are contesting 90 seats in the state and we are confident of getting the mandate with majority
 haryana janhit congress (echgesi) se gathbandhan tuutane ke liye kuldeep vishnoi ko jimmedaar tehraate hue sharma ne kaha ki echgesi ke pramukh kuldeep vishnoi ne ekatarfa dhang se kaaphi abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal karte hue gathbandhan tod diya
 It is being seen by the public and will teach a proper lesson in elections
 ramvilas sharma ne kaha ki haryana janhit congress (echgesi) congress se tuutakar bani thi
 Hooda was made the chief minister in place of Bhajan Lal, on which Bhajan Lal parted ways with the Congress
 unke putr kuldeep vishnoi usee viraasat ko sambhaal rahe hai
 The BJP leader said that the public is watching how Vishnoi is tying up with people like Vinod Sharma and Gopal Kanda, who have split from the Congress
 rajya kii janata ise naapsand karti he or inhen sabak sikhayegi
 Sharma said that the BJP has started a campaign to directly contact the people in every corner of the state by launching four Vijay Sankalp Yatras in the state
 yah kaarykram 31 agast ko puraa ho rahaa he
 He said that Union Ministers Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari and JP Nadda would conclude it in Hathin, Jind, Jhajjar and Panipat respectively

 Preparations for the Gujarat election have started
 2017 ke ant tak vot daale ja sakate hai
 The BJP, which has won the battle in Uttar Pradesh, is now trying to save the pm's stronghold

 The Patel agitation has been in discussion in the state for two years, Hardik Patel demanded reservation and he became the voice of the Patel community
 lekin bijepi ke liye ab chunauti hardik nahin balki saurashtra he
 Saurashtra i
e
 Patel community
 kyonkisaurashtrake bare main kaha jaataa he ki yahaan sadaken or yahaan kaa kaarobaar puure rajya ko gati pradaan to karata he lekin jab baat raajnneeti kii ho to achche-achche dhurandhar kii raftaar par brake bhi laga he
 - The total population of Gujarat is 6 crore 27 lakhs
 isamen patel-patidaar logon kii taadaad 20 fisadi he
 This community has been demanding reservations for a long time
 ye log khud ko obisi category main shaamil karana chaahate hai, taaki collejon or naukariyon main kota mil sake
 The state currently has an OBC reservation of 27 per cent
 - gujarat kii kul 182 vidhansabha siton main 54 siten saurashtra kshetra se aati hai
 The region is dominated by the patel-patidars in the state
 fori raajnneetik aankalan he ki is kshetra main kam se kam 30 vidhansabha siton par yah samudaay kisi ko bhi chunaav haraane or jitaane kaa faisla karata he
 It was Saurashtra itself that in the 1990s, the BJP ended the series of Congress governments and formed the BJP government in the state for the first time in 1995 and Keshubhai Patel became the Chief Minister of the state
 haalanki jald hi vah aresas ke kareebi shankarasingh vaghela se vivaadon main uljhe or nateeja saurashtra ne unki raftaar ko puri tarah se tham liya
 While Keshubhai Patel himself is believed to have created the credit of the BJP in Saurashtra and he was responsible for bringing the vote bank in favor of BJP in this entire region
 - narendra modi ke siem kaarykaal ke dauraan saurashtra lagaatarnarendra modike paksh main rahaa
 This happened despite Keshubhai Patel's pleas not to vote for the BJP
 patel-patidaar samudaay ko narendra modi se lagaataar ummid thi ki vah majboot hue to patelon kii maang ko puraa karne kaa faisla le sakate hai
 Due to this belief, Modi has been the most powerful poster boy in Saurashtra for more than a decade, which is being tried to change through Hardik Patel after he became Prime Minister
 -gauratlab he ki rajya main saurashtra kii 52 siten kisi bhi party ko na sirf jaadui aankade ke paar pahunchane ke liye paryaapt rahati he balki jaadui aankada paar karne vaali party ko 150 siton se zyada kaa str paar karne ke liye bhi behad ahm rahati he
 During Narendra Modi's tenure, the patel-patidar bjp's vote bank may have remained from this region but it could not touch the figure of 150 plus in the assembly to decide on reservation

 There is going to be a close fight at the box office between the two big films 'shivaay' and 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' being released on this Diwali as advance booking has started for both
 multiplex maalikon kii maane to donon hi filmon ko acchhee pratikriya mil rahi he
 But some film exhibitors say that 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' has gained an edge in multiplex theaters while 'shivaay' is getting better response in single screen theaters
 'shivaay' kaa nirmaan-nirdesan abhinayta ajay devgan ne kiya he jabaki 'i dil he mushkil' ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak karan johar hai
 She had been in a lot of controversy recently due to Pakistani artist Fawad Khan in Karan Johar's film
 film main aishwarya raay, ranbir kapur or anoushka sharma mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai
 The comments vahiin 'shivaay' main ajay ke saath navdith abhinetri saaysha sahagal mukhya bhoomika main hai
 Both films are releasing on October 28
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
