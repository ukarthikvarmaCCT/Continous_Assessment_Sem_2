 ) rajasthan ke alvar jile main mob linching main rakabar khan kii maut ke maamle main rajya police par kai gambhir aarope lage hai
 It is alleged that the police preferred to bring the recovered cows to Gaushala first instead of taking Rakbar to the hospital
 yahi nahin, police ne khud bhi rakabar kii pitayee kii
 Due to this, Rakbar was delayed for three hours to reach the hospital and he died
 ukt aaropon par alvar ke espi rajendra singh ne ajtak se kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 It was said in the media reports that it took three hours for Rakbar to reach the hospital and the police preferred to bring the cows to the cowshed instead of Rakbar to the hospital
 gauratlab he ki ramgarh thana kshetra ke lalwandi gaanv main go taskari ke aarope main kuch kathith gorakshakon ne rakabar khan naamak ek shaks ko peet-petakar maar daalaa tha
 In fact, in this case of mob lynching, the BJP government of Rajasthan, which has expressed grief over the death of Rakbar, has begun to surround itself
 bada sawaal he ki kya bheed ke saath milakar police ne bhi rakabar urf akbar ko peeta tha or aspataal le jane ke bajaae thane main laakar patake diya tha? police khud kah rahi he ki rakabaar ne sari kahani use bataai, jabaki doctor kah rahe hai ki aspataal main vah mrit aayaa tha
 The SP of Alwar told Aaj Tak, 'there are allegations that the police beat Rakbar on his own before transporting him to the hospital
 ham is maamle kii jaanch karnaa chaahate hai
 It is also alleged that Rakbar was delayed in reaching the hospital
 yah maamla ek atirikt espi rank ke adhikari ko saunpa gaya he
 He will look into the allegations and investigate the case
 'pehle khud bijepi vidhayak ne kaha tha ki hamarekaaryakartaaon nethodi-bahut pitayee kii thi, uske baad police ne bhi peeta
 Now the eyewitness who gave information to the police is saying that Rakbar Khan, who was injured by mud, bathed first and then made him sit in the car
 pratyakshdarshi kaa kahana he ki gaayen gaushala pehle pahunch gayi or akbar aspataal main baad main pahunchaa
 When he left the cows to come to the cows, the injured Akbar was lying in the police station
 aspataal ke doctor kaa kahana he ki police ghayal ko teen baje ke baad aspataal lekar ai thi
 Questions are being raised on the police that 6 km from the spot
 kii dur aspataal tak pahunchane main use 4 ghante main kaise lag gaye
 SP Rajendra Singh said that if the negligence of the police comes to the fore then we will take action
 grahamantri gulabchand kataaria kaa kahana he ki police kii koi galati nahi he
 Seeing the matter escalating, investigation has been given to Alwar police from Jaipur SP Crime and Vigilance
 times of india kii ek khabar ke anusaar, mob linching ke baad gambhir rup se ghayal rakabar khan ko ghatana se 6 kimi dur ramgarh main sthit saamudayik swasthya centre tak pahunchane main 6 ghante lag gaye
 According to the newspaper, it appears that it was the police's priority to save more cows than to save Rakbar, as cows were transported to Gaushala, 10 km away, an hour before Rakbar was taken to the hospital

 a malware named Copy Cat has affected 14 million Android smartphones around the world
 isamen se lagbhag 8 million divaais ko isane root kar diya
 This report is quite shocking and also raises questions on the safety of Android smartphones
 security form check point ke mutabik duniya bhar ke lagbhag 14 million android divaais ko isane apana nishaanaa banaaya he
 This dangerous malware can root any smartphone or even hijack it to fraud
 bhartiya yugers ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki security form ne kaha he ki is mailaware se sabase zyada asia ke smartphone ko nuksaan hua he
 According to the report, about 2,80,000 Android devices in the US have been affected by this attack
 aankadon ke mutabik pichley saal april or may main isane sabase zyada android koprabhavit kiya tha,lekin tab hi ise google play protect se block kiya gaya jiske baad isamen kami darj kii gai
 Significantly, this malware is not new, but even two years ago, Google released an update to protect the Play Store from it
 haalanki third party eps par google play store kaa utana akhriyaar nahin hota, isliye ye unke sahare android divaais ko prabhavit kar rahe hai
 According to the checkpoint security firm, no evidence has been found so that it can be said that it has come on Google Play
 google ne ek bayaan main kaha he, ‘play protect yugers ko un eps se bachaata he jo copicat mailaware se prabhavit hai
 So it cannot come on the Google Play Store
 Let us tell you that copycat shows itself popular on the Third Party Mobile App Store
 ek baar yah Copy Cat mailaware kisi android smartphone main aata he to sabase pehle ek baar ri start hone kii jarurat hoti he
 However, it may not do its job completely in all devices
 check point security ke mutabik yah jin smartphone main jaataa he unamem se 54 fisadi ko prabhavit karne main kaamyaab hota he
 Researchers have fully developed malware copycat and is capable of causing many kinds of damage
 isamen divaais ko root karne se lekar isamen khatarnaak code daalana shaamil he
 1 in two months by hackers who spread this malware against checkpoint research 5 million dollar batore hai
 It affected 14 million devices worldwide, of which 8 million devices were rooted by this malware
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki security form ise kaaphi khatarnaak bataa rahaa hai kyonki iskaa saxes rate duusare mailaware ke mukaable kaaphi zyada he
 Let me tell you that most of the malware are such that they come in the mobile, but they are not able to do the kind of damage they were designed to do

 PAK had accused India of Pakistan's right to children in the United Nations, accusing India of exposing Pakistan's lies, the right of children in the United Nations was debated on Thursday, in which India exposed Pakistan's pole
 bharat kii ore se pakistan par jammu-kashmir main bacchon ko lekar afvaah failaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 On behalf of India, the First Secretary at the United Nations, Polomi Tripathi, exposed Pakistan's fake agenda
 sanyukt raashtra main is masale par hua ye teesraa seshan tha, jisamen bharat kii polomi treepathi ne pakistan kaa naam liye bina kaha ki yahaan par ek desh kii ore se galat agenda failaayaa ja rahaa he, jiskaa sambandh bharat ke aantarik maamalon se he
 In fact, on behalf of Pakistan, Maliha Lodhi raised the issue of the situation of children in the valley after the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan kii ore se jammu-kashmir main maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa mudda uthaaya gaya tha
 On behalf of India, Paulomi Tripathi said that the country which gives violent education to its children here and later they are sent to terrorist organization
 ye log naa sirf apane bacchon kaa balki duniya kaa bhavishya kharaab kar rahe hai
 If this is not a violation of the rights of children, then what is
 is dauraan unhone pakistan ke dwaara galat dastavejon ko pesh kiye jane kii bhi baat saamne kahi
 India has clarified its stand and said that we hope that the international community will not pay attention to such wrong allegations and respect the facts
 pehle kya kah rahaa tha pakistan?bharat kii ore se is dauraan desh main bacchon, ladakiyon ke liye chalaae ja rahe progaamon kaa zikr kiya gaya or unke mahatv ko aankadon ke saath bataaya gaya
 It is worth noting that in the past, India has exposed Pakistan's lies to the United Nations many times, even before it was done by Pakistan to run a false agenda by revealing pictures of Syria as Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin bharat ne us jhooth kaa bhi pardaafash kar diya tha

 We have used this smartphone for a long time and now we are going to explain its review to you in easy language
 company ne isaki shuruaati keemat 13,999 rupee rakhi he
 Currently, this price segment is very competitive in India
 bild quality and dizin: India is constantly making new achievements in space

 Forty days after launch, it will land on the moon
 mangalvaar ko press conference karte hue isro chairmanke
 Sivan told that before March 2019, India will launch about 19 missions
 vahiin, inamen chandrayan-2 janvari main launch kiya jayega
 This mission will launch on January 3
 bataa den ki pehle chandrayan-2 ko isi saal antariksh main janaa tha, lekin iskedizinmein kuch badlaav kiye jane the jiske kaaran isamen deree hui

 rashtriya rajdhani dilli se sate noida se judaa ek myth he ki jo bhi mukhyamantri noida aayega use yaa to apni gaddi chhodani padegi yaa uske saath kuch apshakun hoga
 However, there have been a lot of political developments behind the prevalence of this myth
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki upi ke sabhi siem noida aane se parhez karte rahe
 But UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not just accept the challenge of this age-old myth provided that Yogi has come to Noida four times after becoming the Chief Minister
 vaise to yogi adityanath ke noida daure ke uparaant na hi unki kursi gai or na hi unke saath kuch apshakun hua
 But it will be interesting to analyze whether UP cm's political status has increased or decreased after coming to Noida? There have been four times Noida Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the first time on 23 December 2017 at the inauguration ceremony of Magenta Line at the Botanical Garden Metro station in Noida
 Came to take stock of the preparations
 phir duusari baar 25 disambar 2017 ko pradhanmantri ke saath metro udghaatan kaarykram main shaamil hue
 Then Yogi said that he would come to Noida again and again
 vahiin pradhanmantri narendra modi ne yogi kii tarif karte hue kaha tha ki ve aadhunik soch rakhte hai
 For the third time, UP chief Yogi Adityanath came to Noida on 17 June last month to inspect the guest house of the UP Irrigation Department and attended a meeting with the officials
 phir chauthi baar 8 july ko noida main samsung kii duniya kii sabase badi mobile unit jiskaa udghaatan piem modi or dakshin korea ke raashtrapati moon je-in ko karnaa tha kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene aae or 9 july ko udghaatan samaaroh main shaamil hue
 All is not going well for Yogi! However, it is too early to see UP chief Yogi Adityanath's Noida visits linking them with political developments happening elsewhere in the state
 lekin yadi ham yogi ke pehle noida daure ke baad pradesh ke raajnneetik ghatnakram par dhyaan den to yah paaenge ki pradesh ke mukhiya ke liye sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the ruling BJP has not performed well in the by-elections in the state after December 23, 2017
 bhaajapa teen loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha upachunaav haar chuki he
 Not only this, after Yogi's resignation from the Lok Sabha, the BJP lost in the by-election in his stronghold Gorakhpur
 pradesh ke dipti siem keshav prasad maury kii phulpur seat bhi bhaajapa nahin bachaa pai
 After that, the Yogi government had to face defeat in Kairana Lok Sabha and Nurpur Assembly
 jiske baad yogi sarkaar kii mukhaalafat is kadar bad gai ki unki sarkaar kii sahyogi suhel dev bhartiya samaaj party ke mukhiya om prakaash rajbhar khule manch se maang karne lage ki pradesh main kisi obisi ko siem banaaya jaae
 It is worth noting that when the party's big leaders reached Lucknow after the BJP got an unexpected majority, there were also slogans of 'poor UP Dola Tha, keshav-keshav Bola Tha' at the airport
 dabi jubaan main centre va rajya main bhaajapa kii sahyogi apana dal kii bhi manshaa he ki pradesh main obisi siem banaaya jaae
 Because the BJP got the most OBC votes
 yogi sarkaar kii chhavi ko sabase bada aghat laga jab unnav se dabang vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kaa naam ek balaatkaar ke maamle main saamne aayaa or sarkaar kii taraf se maamle kii lipapoti karne kii purajor koshish kii gai
 But due to increasing political pressure, the Yogi government had to order a CBI inquiry
 noida ke saath kyon judaa yah myth ?noida se jude is myth kaa itihaas purv mukhyamantri vir bahadur singh ke samay se shuru hota he
 After returning from Noida tour in 1988, the central leadership demanded the resignation of Veer Bahadur Singh
 jiske baad 1989 main narayan dutt tiwari or 1999 main kalyaan singh kii bhi kursi noida se lautne ke baad chali gai
 In 1995, SP mentor Mulayam Singh too lost his government just days after coming to Noida
 vaise to basapa supremeo or purv mukhyamantri mayawati ko bhi noida aane se parhez nahin rahaa
 After becoming the CM of UP in 2007, Mayawati inaugurated several schemes from Noida
 lekin 2012 main jab satish chandra mishra ke soshal ejineering formule ke baavjood upi main basapa kii sarkaar nahin ban pai
 Then the genie of Noida once again came out of the bottle and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not come to Noida even once in his five-year term
 or noida sambandhi sabhi yojanaon kaa udghaatan lakhanu se batan dabaa kar hi kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keeping an eye on every step of his ministers
 unke daftar main kaam karne vaale har adhikari ke chayan main bhi ab piemo dakhsandaji kar rahaa he
 The Central Government on Thursday directed all its ministers not to appoint officers in their personal staff who were working in important positions with the UPA ministers
 is aashay kii khabar angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne di he
 According to the newspaper, the cabinet secretary has issued a decree on behalf of the PMO that all the officials in the previous government who were personal staff of a minister should not be considered
 is sambandh main aupchaarik nirdesh guuruuvaar shaam ko carmik maamle ke mantralay dwaara jari kar diya gaya he
 It was earlier reported that Modi had verbally told his ministers not to make officers who were close to the UPA part of his team
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main piemo ne grahamantri rajnath singh ke nijee sachiv ke taur par 1995 batch ke ipies adhikari alok singh kii niyukti par roak laga di thi
 Alok Singh had been the private secretary of former foreign minister Salman Khurshid in the previous government
 iske alaava modi ne abhinav kumaar or rajesh kumaar kii niyukti par roak laga di thi
 While Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiran Rijuju proposed Abhiwan Kumar to be his personal secretary, Rajesh Kumar wanted to make Minister of State for External Affairs General VK Singh his personal secretary
 aapako bataa den ki upie main abhinav kumaar shashi tharur ke nijee sachiv the vahiin rajesh chandresh kumari katoch ke nijee sachiv the
 The CEO of NATGRID had misbehaved, hence the extension was not found in the manner in which the PMO is avoiding the close officials of the Congress, in the same way, the Home Ministry has also taken a similar decision
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne neshnal intelegence grid (natgrid)ke purv raghu raman ke kaarykaal ko badhaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 His term ended on 31 May
 'da indian express' ke mutabik, khufia vibhaag kii report ke aadhaar par raghu raman kaa kaarykaal nahin badhaayaa gaya
 Actually, in this report Raghu Raman has spoken about misbehaving with foreign nationals
 aapako bataa den ki raghu raman kii niyukti upie sarkaar ne 1 disambar 2009 ko thi
 The IB report against him was also shared with the UPA government which was ignored
 haalanki jab raghu raman ke kaarykaal badhaane kii file rajnath singh ke paas ai to ibi kii is report ko grahamantri se saajha kiya gaya jiske baad unhone kaarykaal nahin badhaane kaa faisla kiya

 kendra sarkaar ne railway bajet kaa aam bajet main vilay karne ke baad railway deveopment athurity banane kaa faisla liya he
 With this step, the central government's exercise is to run the rail of deficit on the track of profit
 rail ke liye bani atharity ke adhikaar kshetra main aane vaale kaam se yakeenan railway main bade sudhaar kaarykram kaa rasta tay hoga
 But the mere creation of an authority will not improve the status of the railway because the authority is still not in the jurisdiction of the Railways due to the plight of the railways
 lihaaja, jis tarah railway kaa bajet ab vittamantralay ke adheen ho chukaa he usee tarah railway main sudhaar kaa daaromadar bhi vitt mantralay par he
 The rail authority will do this three tasks

 But it is impossible to bring Indian Railways on fast track without doing these 5 works
 1
 Railways will have to separate social service and business interest2
 gaiyr railway kaam ko privetij kare yaa unhen uchit vibhaagon ke supurd kare (skool, stadium, hospital)3
 Freight will have to be worked out on a war footing to meet the rapidly standing challenge in highway construction in the country
 4
 The responsibility of operating the railway will have to be separated from undertakings such as manufacturing, catering, railways 5
 railway kii nai companiyon main privet sector or videsh nivesh kii madad se share bazaar main list karaayaa jaae jisase vah bhi ek purna company kii tarah kaarobaar kar sake
 Significantly, freight and passenger fares are the major source of earnings of Indian Railways

 His concern and caution can be felt in almost all the three films that came together almost four months before the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 inamen do filmein 'da accidental prime ministar' evam 'uri' jahaan ek paale kii filmein hai, vahiin 'thakare' isi shrenee kii, kintu anya paale kii film he
 This is the first time since independence, when purely political films inspired by political objectives (the same as biography) came out
 haalanki isaki ek shuruyaat san 1975 main 'aandhi' se hui thi, lekin apatkaal ke tufaan kaa kuch aisa kahar is par tutaa ki filmkaaron kii raajnneetik vishyon par film banane kii himmat hi tut gai
 But should the coming of these three political films together be seen as evidence of the government's liberal democratic approach towards cinema
 
 
 ? iskaa sahi uttar is prashn se mil saktaa he ki yadi centre main congress kii sarkaar rahi hoti, to kya 'da accidental prime ministar' film release ho paati
 
 
 The Or there is also a question that if someone makes a similar film on the current Prime Minister, then how would politics behave with him
 
 
 ?iske uttar ke rup main ek saal pehle ai film 'padmavat' ke saath ghatit ghatana ko cese study ke rup main prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Certainly it was a historical film, not a political film
 lekin is film main raajnneeti kii khoj kar lee gai, or uske baad jo kuch hua, vah film itihaas kaa ek swatantra adhyay ban chukaa he
 The state governments of a particular political party stayed the performance of the Supreme Court bypassing the decision, but the recent assembly elections recently proved their political stakes wrong
 har desh kii sattayen apane prachaar-prasar ke liye anek tarah ke upayon kaa sahaara leti ai hai
 Communist governments reached the limit of extreme in this matter
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki ye filmein raajnneetik na rahakar vishuddh propegnda banakar rah gayi
 His natural influence on people ceased
 kuch-kuch aisa hi ham 'da accidental prime ministar' tathaa 'thakare' film ke saath hota hua dekh rahe hai
 Clearly, when viewers lose faith in the credibility of such films, they stop accepting them
 anupam kher kii is film main upasthiti tathaa vartmaan sarkaar kaa pichley paune paanch saalon se apni puvavarti par kiye jane vaale nirantar maukhik aghat ne is film ko sandehaaspad bana diya
 The biggest challenge of political films is how they can overcome their personal political beliefs and present the story with maximum neutrality
 isliye unki banaavat kaaphi kuch dacumentry filmon ke kareeb pahunch jaati he
 We have to accept that there has been a lot of positive changes in audience interest, especially for the last five years
 jivan ke saamaanya se yathartwaadee prasangon par aadhaarit atyant chote bajet kii filmon ko apane sir-maathe par bithakar darshako ne jo kamaal kiya he, vah raajnneetik filmon ke bhavishya ke liye bahut acha sanket he
 Undoubtedly such films will also serve as a nutrient for the health of democracy
 isliye yah uchit samay he ki filmkaar is disha main sochen
 When good political films start appearing, the impact of politics on films will automatically reduce

 Referring to the statement of a saint that 'the river Nari drowns the untamed waters / No saint can be found who crosses', he said that it is very difficult to understand both the woman and the river, but poetess Rachna Sharma instinctively understood the female mind
 Have tried
 ve jaanati hai ki prem or stri donon kaa astitv rahegaa tabhi samaaj kaa astitv rahegaa
 He said that today's rich poetry world suggests that poets have a lot to say on their time as well as human aspects that need to be revealed
 yah kaam rachana sharma apni kavitaaon main bakhubi kar rahi hai
 Today, the poet does the job of cutting the changes that are happening in the mind of a foggy person
 kavi hi hamaare samay kaa aalochak hota he
 Dr
 Singh said that in the poems of 'nadi Ab Maun Hai', the poetess has transformed all the small things of everyday into a big sense world, within which the status is reflected
 hindi ke sudhi aalochak evam kavi dow om nishchal ne bataur sanchaalak rachana sharma ke uttarottar samrudh hote kavy sansar par roshni daalate hue kaha ki 'antarpath' evam 'neend ke hisse main kuch raat bhi aane do' kii rachanaakaar rachana sharma apane nae sangrah main striyon kii alakshith abhivyakti, sapanom or hausalon ko ek nai udaan detii hai
 This vocalism of the creator of 'antar Path' can be seen in many of his poems
 usne prakruti paryaavaran ko apni kavi chintaa main shaamil karte hue nadi, stri or maa ke bahaane us alakshith karunaa ko bhedane kii cheshtaa kii he jo aksar striyon ke hisse main rahi he
 He said that the river is now silent - not just a poem, but also today the river Ganga expresses the silence and emptiness of the river in the hot sparse period
 jis tarah baandhon or baadhaon se nadiyon kii gati avaruddh he, usee tarah striyon kii abhivyakti ke sammukh anek gatyavrodh hai
 The river is now silent — a reflection of these adversities

 The poet expresses this in his speech

 kasaab 26 / 11 ke mukademe ke dauraan jail or adaalat ke kaksh main apane ashaaleen vyavhaar ke kaaran bhi charchaa main aayaa tha
 He attacked the prison staff on September 1 and the scene of the attack was captured on CCTV which is installed in his cell

" is par kasaab ne gelkarmiyon ke saath hathapayee kii, jo sidi main saaf dikh rahi he
 'public Prosecutor Nikam said' Kasab is a trained commando and he can execute activities very fast

 'he filed an affidavit prepared by the jailor in the court

 Nikam informed the High Court that after the September 1 incident, officials were monitoring the activities of Kasab 24 hours through CCTV and all the time an officer was monitoring him from a distance of four feet

 vishesh nyaayadhish em el tahiliyani ne kaha tha, ‘kasaab ko jivit rakhana samaaj or bharat sarkaar ke liye khatre ko barkaraar rakhana hoga
 'he had said,' The possibility of Kasab's reform can be completely ruled out

 New Zealand's Martin Guptill may not be considered as a stormy batsman as Chris Gayle, but he has overtaken Chris Gayle's storm
 westeindies ke saamne world cap quarter final muqaabale main martin guptin ne 163 gendon par noteout 237 ran thok die
 The World Cup's highest score became Guptill
 guptil ne apni pari main 24 chauke or 11 chakke lagaae
 During this innings, he surpassed Chris Gayle's record of not out 215 runs against Zimbabwe in this World Cup
 guptil aakhri overon main jis tarah se ballebaazi kar rahe the, usase bharat ke rohit sharma ke 264 ranon ke record ko khatra ho gaya tha
 He had not survived the over, otherwise the record of one-day cricket's greatest innings would also have become Guptill's name

 ye dabaav itnaa zyada hota he ki guptil se pehle world cap itihaas main kisi ballebaaz ne 150 ran kaa score nahin banaaya tha
 Prior to Guptill, the record for the highest score in the knockout round of the World Cup was in the name of Australian batsman Adam Gilchrist
 gilcrist ne 2007 ke worldcup final main srilanka ke khilaaf 149 ranon kii tufaani pari kheli thi
 With this vigorous innings, Guptill has become the batsman of the biggest innings in ODI cricket for New Zealand
 haalanki noteout 189 ran ke saath ye record pehle bhi unke hi naam tha
 Martin Guptill also scored a century against Bangladesh before scoring a century against the West Indies
 guptil kisi bhi world cap ke dauraan lagaataar do maichon main shatak banane vaale newzealand ke pehle ballebaaz ban gaye hai
 He is the fourth batsman to show this feat during this World Cup
 unase pehle srilanka ke kumaar sangakara ne 2015 ke world cap ke dauraan lagaataar 4 maichon main 4 shatak banaae the, jabaki bangladesh ke mahamudulla or zimbabwe ke brandan tailor ne bhi lagaataar do maichon main shatak banane kaa karnama dikhaaya tha

 (notification dekhne ke lieclicukaren) England scored 279 runs for the loss of six wickets against Sri Lanka on the first day of the third Test match of the three-test series at Lord's Cricket Ground, thanks to the innings of 85 runs by Johnny Beyersto (107 not out) and captain Alastair Cook
 pehle din kaa khel khatm hone tak england ke bersto ke saath kris vokes 23 ranon par naabad pavilion laute
 England captain Alastair Cook missed his 29th century in the match and the match of Australian veteran Don Bradman
 vah jab shatak se 15 ranon se dur the tabhi nuwan pradeep ne unhen pagabaadha kar pavilion bheja
 Cook hit 17 fours in his innings, facing 173 balls
 iske alaava unhone ahm samay par bersto ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye 80 ranon kii saajhedaari kar team ko sambhala
 This partnership happened at a time when England lost their four wickets for 84 runs
 toss jeet kar ballebaaji karne utari england ko cook or elex helles (18) ne haalanki dhimi lekin sadhi hui shuruyaat di or pehle wicket ke liye 56 ran jode
 Rangana Herath broke this partnership by sending Hales to the pavilion
 helles ke jane ke baad nik crampton (1), joe root (3) or james vinse (10) ke saste main out hone ke baad team sankat main aa gai thi, lekin captain or bersto ne team ko sankat se baahar nikaala
 After Cook's departure, Beyersto led the innings with Moin Ali (25) and shared a 62-run partnership for the sixth wicket
 ali ko herath ne apana doosraa shikaar banaaya
 Vox then took the field with Beyerstow on the field and returned to an unbeaten pavilion

 The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill 2019 was passed in the Rajya Sabha on Monday
 ise centre sarkaar kii ek badi jeet ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 In order to reduce the impact of Section 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the Home Minister introduced a resolution, along with it he also managed to pass the State Reorganization Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 prastaav ko ab loksabhaa main charchaa or paas karaane ke liye pesh kiya jayega
 Once the Parliament is approved, the proposal will become law
 iske anusaar rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baanta jayega
 Jammu and Kashmir with one assembly and Ladakh region without assembly
 grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki anuchhed 370 ko khatm kar diya jaae, kyonki yahi sabhi pareshaaniyon kii jad he
 He said that democracy cannot flourish under Article 370
 pichley do dashakon main rajya main lagbhag 41 hajaar log maare gaye hai
 However, it is the birthplace of Kashmir's rebirth because now the geographical and political map of Jammu and Kashmir has completely changed
 sansad main jammu-kashmir ko lekar centre sarkaar kaa ek faisla or vidheyak pesh kiye unke teen bade myne hai
 After the signing of the first President, except for Article 1 of 370 in Kashmir, all other sections have been abolished including 35A
 
 Second, the status of full statehood will be taken away from Kashmir through the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill
 ab jammu-kashmir ek centre shasit pradesh hoga or ladakh doosraa centre shasit pradesh hoga
 tisraj-jammu-kashmir will have assembly like Delhi but Ladakh has been made a union territory without assembly like Chandigarh
 jammu kashmir kaa nakshaa badalane tak baat simit nahin he
 Much more has changed in Kashmir
 kyonki ab kashmir main dhara 370 ke un saare praavdhaanon kaa khaatmaa ho jayega jo jammu-kashmir ko bharat kaa hissaa hote hue bhi apana alag samvidhan lagu karne kii ijaajat detaa tha
 What will happen now - in Jammu and Kashmir, now any citizen of the country will be able to buy property - in Jammu and Kashmir now any citizen of the country will be able to get a job - in Jammu and Kashmir, now any citizen of the country will be able to contest elections - Jammu- There will no longer be a separate flag in Kashmir
 
 Only the tricolor will be waved - insult of national flag and national symbols will be punishable in Jammu and Kashmir too - every law made in Parliament for the country will now be applicable in Jammu and Kashmir also - President's rule can be imposed in Jammu and Kashmir too
 -jammu and Kashmir will now have an assembly term of 5 years instead of 6 years-like in Jammu and Kashmir, now the Right to Information Act can be implemented
 Those who were not yet till date - the provision of imposing financial emergency in the country will also apply in Jammu and Kashmir which was not done till now - in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Penal Code i
e
 IPC will be replaced instead of Ranveer Penal Code or RPC - Jammu and Kashmir In so far, the rules of reservation will be applicable like the rest of the states
 a woman of one country - Jammu and Kashmir, will not be deprived of the right to property if she marries a citizen of another state
 Haghi
 aasaan bhashaa main kahen to ab jammu-kashmir bhi ek desh-ek vidhaan par chalegaa
 By the way, an important thing to note is that except for provision-1 of section 370 in Kashmir, all other provisions will end
 yani dhara-370 puri tarah khatm nahin hui he
 But it has become completely ineffective
 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko puri tarah tabhi khatm kiya ja saktaa tha jab desh kii sansad ke alaava jammu-kashmir kii samvidhan sabha isaki manjuuri detii
 But now after the separate constitution of Jammu and Kashmir is repealed, 370 can be completely canceled with the approval of Parliament and Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly
 kul milakar jammu-kashmir main dhara 370 ke saare daant tode ja chuke hai or isi ke saath hi 17 november 1956 ko lagu hua kashmir kaa alag samvidhan bhi puri tarah bekaar ho jayega

 Amid fears of a breakdown of the jds-congress alliance after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Karnataka BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa on Sunday said that the party is in favor of holding fresh elections to the assembly in such a condition
 unhone nayi sarkaar ke gathan ke liye kshetreey party ke saath saajhedaari se bhi inkaar kar diya
 Yeddyurappa said, 'it is impossible to form a government with the help of JDS
 kumaraswami (HD Kumaraswamy) ke mukhyamantri rahete hue mujhe 20-20 shashan kaa kadava anubhav rahaa he' unhone kaha, ‘main galtiyaan doharaana nahin chahta
 In response to a question, Yeddyurappa said that the party is in favor of re-election in the state
 bataa den loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main karnataka main congress or jedies ko mahaj ek-ek siten hi naseeb ho sakin
 This is considered the worst performance of the Congress in Karnataka so far
 vahiin bijepi ne record pradarshan kiya he
 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge lost to Gulbarga and former Prime Minister and JDS supremo HD Deve Gowda in front of BJP candidates in Tumkur seat
 gauratlab he ek saal pehle kumaraswami ne rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar ke pramukh ke rup main shapath lee thi
 There was a political drama in the state before Kumaraswamy became the chief minister when BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa had to resign as the chief minister of the three-day-old government after he failed to prove his majority in the assembly
 kumaraswami ke 23 may 2018 ko shapath grahan samaaroh main deshbhar ke kai pramukh netaa ekasaath manch par najar aae the or ise loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle bijepi virdohi gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ke rup main dekha gaya tha

 (input language) bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar chaar divasiy japan yatra ke baad vatan vaapasi kar rahe hai, lekin usase pehle unke soobe main is yatra ko lekar ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he
 Tejashwi Yadav, former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, has attacked his visit
 haalanki jab unase is hamale kii vajah poochi gai, to tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki jab saal 2009 main unke pita lalu yadav japan gaye the, to nitish ne un par kataaksh kiya tha, jiskaa aaj hamane jawaab diya he
 At the same time, in these four days, the Chief Minister talked to many politicians and industrialists in Japan
 unhone bihar main sadak or patna metro ko lekar nivesh kii sambhaavnaaon par charchaa kii
 At the same time, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav added Nitish's visit to a film song from the other side, giving a political air
 bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadavadwara filmi gane ke jariye kiye gaye tanj kii vajah se nitish kumaar kaa japan daura soobe main kaaphi charchaa main rahaa
 Even before Nitish Kumar reached Japan, Tejashwi Yadav tweeted a song about him
 yah gaanaa 1966 kii film 'lav in tokyo' kaa he
 Tejashwi wrote about this that Nitish Kumar is doing Love in Tokyo
 saath hi is film kaa mashhoor gaanaa 'le gai dil gudiya japan kii' kii kuch line bhi twit kii
 After this, another famous song from the same film 'sayonara, Sayonara' also tweeted on Nitish
 haalanki jab sawaal uthe ki aakhir tejasvi yadav ke nitish par is prakaar ke hamale kii vajah kya he, to iskaa jawaab unhone nahin diya
 Tejashwi said that in 2009, eight years ago, his father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav visited Japan as a railway minister
 us samay bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne unke upar tanj kasate hue lav in tokyo kaa yah gaanaa 'le gai dil gudiya japan kii pagal mujhe kar diya' or 'sayonara sayonara' kaa zikr kiya tha or ab unhone is gane ko apni taraf se puraa kar diya
 Tejaswine said that JDU leaders are quite chilly due to the attack on Nitish Kumar over the song Love in Tokyo
 tejasvi ne kaha ki in sabhi jadyu ke netaaon ko yah yaad rakhana chahie tha ki unke netaa nitish kumaar ne saal 2009 main lalu prasad ke japan daure ko lekar koun sa geet gunagunaaya tha? jadyu ke pravaktaaon par tanj kasate hue tejasvi ne kaha ki ye sabhi netaa apane laalach kii purti ke liye nitish ke saath hai or bina homework kiye kuch bhi bayaan de dete hai
 Tejashwi said that JDU spokespersons should at least cross-check with a prudent person before making a statement

 com / oi6dixgfnp— PMO India (@pmoindia)may 17, 2015 It seems that now there is no getting rid of inflation
 subjiyon ke bhav to pehle se hi qamar tod hi rahe hai, ab daal or masaalon ke bhav bhi bada jhatka dene vaale hai
 Prices of pulses and spices have increased in the wholesale market and now soon its effect will also be seen on the retail market
 udhar, chini bhi aapke swaad ko or kadava karne kii taiyaari main he
 It was once said, 'pulses will eat bread, will sing the virtues of God' but now even pulses and spices are becoming far from the reach of common man
 pichley 15 dinon main thok bazaar main daal or masaalon ke bhav 5 se 10 fisadi tak bad gaye hai
 In the last 15 days, gram has become expensive by Rs 5 in the wholesale market
 mung saabut main kareeb 10 rupye kaa izapha dekhne ko mila vahiin masoor or raajma 5-5 rupye mahange ho gaye hai
 Same is the case with spices
 pichley 15 dinon main jira 110 rupye kilo se badhkar 120 rupye kilo ho gaya he
 There is an increase of 9 rupees and 12 rupees in the price of coriander and turmeric
 maharashtra or karnataka main kam barish kii vajah se daal or masaale kii keemton main teji ai he
 The government has declared drought in several districts of Maharashtra and Karnataka
 aamtaur par dalhan kii buaai maharashtra, karnataka ke alaava madhya pradesh or rajasthan main hoti he
 This time due to bad monsoon, farmers have reduced the sowing of pulses, due to which the effect is now visible on the market
 barish zyada ho jaae to mahangaai, barish kam ho to mahangaai
 The government has no concrete strategy to deal with this problem
 yahi vajah he ki thok bazaar main daalon ke daamon main achaanak tezi aa gai he
 This boom is still seen in the wholesale market and in the coming days, the effect of this increase will be seen in the retail market as well
 har saal desh main 180 lakh ton daalon kii zarurat he
 Out of this 140 million tonnes of pulses are produced in the country
 kareeb 25 se 30 lakh ton myanmar, australia or canada se aayaat kii jaati he
 There is currently a shortage of about 1 million tonnes of pulses in the country
 lekin is saal kharaab monsoon or duusari fasalon main teji ko dekhte hue kisaan kaa rujhaan daalon kii ore kam rahaa he
 Inflation is now going to have an impact on festivals too
 kuch hi dinon main raakhi aane vaali he, lekin usase pehle chini ke thok bhav main 3 se 4 rupye kilo kaa izapha dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 One big truth is that as the price increases in the wholesale market, its effect in the retail market is manifold
 or phir ek baar daam badhane ke baad itani aasaani se kam bhi nahin hote he

 The heavier the book of law is, the greater the probability of its burst
 upi vidhansabha chunaavon par bhi yah baat sateek baithti he
 The code of conduct came into force as soon as elections were declared
 farmaanon kii jhdi lag gai, deevaaron par lage naare rang die gaye, poster faad daale gaye, jhande-binar utaar die gaye, naaron kaa shor kabhi sunai hi nahin diya
 The electoral color has become so vicious that it is as if there is no election; sarsari najar daalen to kaha ja saktaa he ki chunaav behad saaf-suthere hue
 But if you scrape the surface a little, it can now be said with certainty that a terrible truth is hidden under the packaging of clean election
 yah pradesh kaa sabase mahangaa chunaav sabit ho rahaa he, jisamen behisaab paisa phenkaa gaya or sharaab to is kadar bahaai gai maano baadh kaa pani
 When the Election Commission was moving around, parties and candidates were running
 gafalat main padaa chunaav ayog matdaan khatm hone ke baad yah kah saktaa he ki usne karodon rupye jabt kiye or lakhon litre sharaab pakadi, lekin chunaav main isse kai guna zyada paisa or sharaab banti gai
 In this election, some unique and new methods of manipulating the Election Commission were adopted
 1
 If there is a ban on bringing and distributing the return note of the bill, what kind of sorrow is happening due to the slip, there is a danger in carrying the money
 chunaav ayog se lekar inakam tex vibhaag or visilence kii team har gaadi ko soongh rahi he, har gaadi kii dikky kholkar dekhne kii koshish ho rahi he
 Don't care agar kisi ke paas haath se likhi parchi par kisi ke dastakhat hon to koi bhi agency kya kar legi
 In Gorakhpur, liquor was being obtained from the liquor store when such a slip was given at a particular place
 duusare kism kii parchi dikhaane par jewelers kii dukaan se nathuni or baaliyaan mil rahi thim
 Petrol was getting on showing the slip in Bahraich and then cash in Meerut
 isamen pakade jane kaa khatra kam-se-kam he or is tarah samarthakon or matadaataaon tak paise or duusare gift aasaani se pahunchaae ja sakate hai
 Most of the leaders who distribute slips are relatives and close so that even if caught, the candidature is not canceled
 parchi yaa hundi kaa istemaal un kaamon main ho rahaa he jinka zikr chunaav kharch main nahin karnaa he, masalan- khaane-pine kaa intjaam, petrol kharch aadi
 Banti in Balrampur In this slip 'R' means a special person and Star means thousand rupees
 2
 Vote contractors and vote agents who have the votes, the notes are passed on to them, this is the biggest expense
 In the election, most of the money is distributed through village heads, former heads, BDC members and influential caste people
 ummidavaaron ne chunaav se pehle or chunaav ke dauraan pataa lagaaya ki vot ke thok manager koun hai, unki haisiyat ke hisaab se 5,000 se 5 lakh ru
 Up to tarai kshetra main prabhaavshaalee logon ko netaaon ne alsidi tivi or motorcycilen bhi deen taaki ve apane prabhaav kaa istemaal karke vot dilaaein
 a candidate from Garhotha seat in Jhansi bought Bolero and 50 similar suvs for vote contractors
 istemaal ke baad ye ummidavaar ke paas laut aaengi
 About Gonda Sadar region it is estimated that individual candidates have raised Rs 5 crore
 tak isi tarah se baante
 a commission of up to 10 per cent was also given to fund the vote contractors
 vot agenton ke madhyam se prati parivaar 500 ru
 1,000 to Rs
 tak die gaye
 3
 motorcycle se tokari takarupye ko sahi jagah tak pahunchane ke liye aajamaae gaye nayab tareekapaise car yaa esayuvi kii jagah motorcycle par rakhkar pahunchaae gaye
 In Gonda and Barabanki, in the first week of February, about 20 lakhs being taken on motorcycles to different places
 inakam tex vibhaag ne jabt kiye
 These motorcycles usually cost between 1 and 5 lakh
 mili
 Where there was more strictness, rupees were kept in fruit baskets

 The night of the murder and that is fought a few hours before the baggage begins, the entire business of the real election seems clean till the day before the voting
 phir aati he katl kii raat, yani matdaan se pehle kii raat
 At this time, the highest exchange of money takes place and the river of liquor is shed
 is ek din main kai baar hawa badal jaati he
 The candidate who appears to be winning is left behind somewhere
 isi din vot thekedaar paala badalte hai or iske liye apni keemat vasuulate hai
 The more votes the contractor got, the heavier the pan
 kai baar aise ummidavaaron ko bhi rupye dekar maidan se hataa diya gaya, jinase vot katane kaa dar tha
 Getting voters to the booth is a very expensive job in itself, for this work the trusted people of the candidate give the bag for the polling booth
 isamen poling agent ke liye agent form, voter list or nakadi hoti he
 This bag is for the tea-water of polling agents and their supporters
 azamgarh main ek baste main ausatan 2,000 ru
 And strong candidates gave three or more bags at each booth
 shahari ilaakon main baste baari hote hai
 5
 sharaab main he vot kaa nashachunaav jeetne kaa yah arase se chalaa aa rahaa behad lokapriy nuskhaa hob vah vakt nahin rahaa jab ummidavaar badi sankhya main sharaab stock karke rakhata tha
 The wine still divides and divides more than before, but cautiously
 elahabaad main dekha gaya ki sharaab choti khep main kharidi gai or use saavdhaanee se sahi logon tak pahunchaaya gaya
 People close to the candidates were involved in this transaction
 nepal kii seemaa se sate maharajaganj, siddharthanagar or baharich ke ilaakon main nepal se laakar laila, sonphi, karnali or mahakali sharaab banti gai
 Not only this, due to the open border, people were sent to Nepal in a 5-7 group and a feast was also held
 siddharthanagar ke ek netaa kehete hai ki bade dalon ke ummidavaaron ne is tarah sharaab pilaane par hi 5 lakh ru
 Spent up to 6
 In Begani wedding, cash can be given on the occasion of leader Deewanshadi and there are many people too, this time Uttar Pradesh election came in the wedding season and the candidates did not let this opportunity go by hand
 khaskar, ladakiyon kii shaadi main ummidavaar dal-bal ke saath pahunche or mauka dekh noton kaa lipapha bhi thama diya
 On this occasion, a lot of people gather together, so public relations was done without any hassle
 kai ummidavaaron ne garib matadaata kii beti kii shaadi kaa kharch bhi uthaaya
 a candidate from Garotha region of Jhansi has been doing this work for a long time
 ve ab tak 500 shaadiyaan kara chuke hai
 In eastern Uttar Pradesh, some candidates have performed mass marriages
 shaadi main jane main chunaav prachaar ke liye tay samaysima bhi todi ja sakati he
 7
 dami ummidavaar kaa khelhar dami ummidavaar ke saath milti he zyada gadiyon or chunaav kharch kii suvidhayah khel vaaki niraala he
 a candidate gets Rs 16 lakh for campaigning
 kharch karne kii seemaa, prachaar ke liye 10 gadiyon kii ijaajat or matdaan kendron par poling agent dene kii suvidha milti he
 Raising a dummy candidate means Rs 32 lakh
 , 20 gaadiyaan or har booth par do poling agent
 There is no legal ban on contesting elections and the candidate is dummy or real, there is no identity
 isliye kahana mushkil he ki jonpur ke madyaahuun se chunaav lard rahe munna bajrangi kii patni seemaa singh asli ummidavaar hai yaa dami
 Zakir Rana, uncle of Shahnawaz Rana of Rashtriya Lok Dal from Bijnor seat, filed an independent form
 isi jile kii badhapur seat par bhaajapa ummidavaar dow
 Indradev's son Gaurav Singh also filed an independent form
 isaki ek vajah shaayad yah bhi he ki agar kisi kaaran ummidavaar kaa parchaa khaarij hua to bhi maidan main parivaar kaa koi sadsy jarur rahe
 a dummy candidate can be caught only if another candidate's election material or flag is recovered from his car
 ayog ke ek adhikari kaa maananaa he ki is baar pradesh main kam-se-kam 2,000 dami candidet khadey hai
 8
 dharm se bhi milte hai votkisi ne dharmasthalon kii marammat karai to kisi ne diya baari daandharm ke naam par vot maangana manaa he, lekin dharm ke naam par vot dene par koi pabandi nahin he
 Therefore, on the occasion of elections, the status of religious leaders increases
 hameshaa ilaake kii masjid main namaaj padhane vaale agra ke ek pratyaashee chunaav ke maukey par jama masjid main namaaj padhane or phir vot maangane pahunch gaye
 When the Muslim candidate made a bhandara in the Shiva temple, the Hindu candidate reached to attend the Urs at the shrine of Topishah Baba
 kai jagahon par netaaon ne chunaav ayog kii najar bachaakar chadhaava bhi chadhaaya
 In Daryabad in Barabanki, Katra in Gonda and Bakshi Talab in Lucknow, candidates paid a lot of money for the restoration of the shrines and asked for votes in return

 Hitech code is the way to break the marketing from smuggling to SMS and social networking, hence Facebook and Twitter are also being promoted
 yah kaam theke par bhi hota he, jiskaa kharch chunaav kharch main nahin joda jaataa
 Many candidates in Lucknow and Faizabad got calls and sent SMS to voters from telemarketing companies
 ye esemes chunaav prachaar ke dauraan baar-baar bheje gaye
 Calls were also made to voters on behalf of some candidates
 is kaam main lakhon rupye ke theke die gaye
 There are hundreds of ways, which the candidates used to manipulate the Election Commission
 lekin online or digital prachaar kaa asli rang is baar hi dikhaa
 10
 chunaav kii chaay partyparty koi karata he, kharchaa ummidavaar detaa he
 The unique way of public relations was such tea parties in Kankanpur, in which 20-25 people attended and whose expenses were borne by the candidates
 ummidavaaron ke kharch par pratyaashiyon ko chaay party par bulaakar jansampark kaa intjaam karaayaa gaya
 Such feasts and parties are plentiful throughout the state
 ab koi chaay party kare to uskaa kharch chunaav kharch main jodne kaa koi matlab hua bhala!kul milakar chunaav ayog chunaav sudhaar ke tamaam kaaryakramon se jo lakshya hasil karnaa chahta tha, ve uttar pradesh ke gali-muhallon main munh ke bal gire pade hai

 sattadhari bijepi apane 15 saal ke kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par janata ke bich jaaegi, vahiin vipakshi dal congress votaron ko rijhaane ke liye roj nae-nae vaade rahi he
 The Nagaud seat in Satna district is currently occupied by the Congress and is owned by Seyadvendra Singh

 Sharma has requested for an investigation into the espionage case and the Gujarat government not only strongly opposed it, but also accused him of being involved in a number of cases including attempting to escape from the country with the help of fake passports
 sheersh adaalat ne sharma ko apni patni or bete se milane ke liye america jane kii ijaajat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Both of them are US citizens
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki sharma kii jasusi cond kii sibiai jaanch kii arji par tabhi vichaar kiya jayega jab isaki pushti ho jaaegi ki uske 12 may, 2011 ke aadesh par amal kiya ja chukaa he
 Sharma, a 1984-batch Indian Administrative Service officer, wants the criminal cases pending against him to be investigated by the CBI and the case transferred out of Gujarat
 sheersh adaalat ne sharma ko nirdesh diya ki modi ke khilaaf 'apmanjanak' aaropon se sambandhit paragraph nikaal kar sanshodhit yachika daayar kii jaae
 a division bench of Justices Ranjana Prakash Desai and Justice Madan B
 Lokur held that since the amended petition is not available during the hearing, the amended petition needs to be matched with the original petition
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki ham dekhenge ki kya aapane hamaare aadesh par amal kiya he yaa nahin
 We want to review the amended petition as the Gujarat government and Modi's close aide Amit Shah allege that Sharma's plea for a CBI probe contained outrageous allegations
 nyaayadhishon ne kaha, 'yadi aisa he to ham paragraph kaa milan karenge
 We have to see that the order has been followed
 yadi aadesh par amal kiya gaya he to ham is par gaur karenge anyathaa ham is par vichaar nahin karenge
 The court also directed to list the petition filed for espionage after two weeks
 sharma ke vakil prashanth bhushan ne daleel di ki arji main modi ke khilaaf aaropon kaa saar dena jaruri he taaki gujarat sarkaar kii kathith durbhaavna ko darshaya ja sake jisane nilambit iees adhikari or uske ipies adhikari bhai kuldeep sharma par anek jhuthe maamle thope diye hai kyonki usne nrutyaangna mallika sarabhai ke khilaaf maamle darj karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 But these pleas of Prashanth were opposed by senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani on behalf of Amit Shah and said that Sharma has not implemented the judicial order of May 12, 2011, which was not allowed to be placed in the petition filed in the ten paragraphs of the original petition
 Instructions were given
 nyaayalay ne sharma ko america jane kii anumati dene se inkaar karte samay apane us aadesh par gaur kiya jisamen is adhikari ko jamaanat dete vakt anek sharte lagaayi gayi thim
 Gujarat's Additional Advocate General Tushar Mehta opposed Sharma's request for a foreign visit and attracted the court's attention to several other cases, including a 2007 case in this regard
 sharma 2007 ke maamle main faraar the or baad main vah nayi dilli ke ek guest house main mili jahaan farji pahchaan se rah rahe the
 He said that Sharma allegedly has a driving license in the name of another person who has his photo on it and examination of his laptop has revealed that he is attempting to flee the country
 mehta ne sheersh adaalat ke aadesh kaa zikr karte hue kaha, 'nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki in maamalon main police kii jaanch puri hone tak vah desh se baahar nahin jaaenge or unke khilaaf paanch maamalon kaa nibatara hone tak unka passpot nahin lautaaya jayega
 Taking cognizance of this argument of the Gujarat government, the court said that it seems difficult to accept this request
 sharma ne 2011 main ek yachika daayar karke anurodh kiya tha ki unke khilaaf darj maamalon kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpi jaae or november, 2013 main vah jasusi cond kaa vivaad bhi sheersh adaalat lekar aa gaye the

 ) Sourav Ganguly revealed on Monday that Rahul Dravid knew what Greg Chappell was doing during the tenure of the Indian coach, but he could not control the Australian

 Ganguly said, "I don't want to go back in those times
" aap nateezon main dekh sakate ho
 This was one of the worst phase of Indian cricket and the worst phase that cricket can pass, especially a player like me
 ek ke baad ek jhooth bolaa ja rahaa tha or chah maheene baad vah rahul ko hataakar sachin ko captain bananaa chahta tha
 It shows how that person did their work
 ’’ The former Indian captain said, "I was not surprised to qualify for India's next round (of the 2007 World Cup)
 main jab team main waapas aayaa to maine kaaphi samay baad dravid se is bare main baat kii or use bataaya ki is tarah kii chijen ho rahi hai
 He said that he knows, but he can't control Greg
 ’’ Tendulkar has revealed in his book that Chappell once said that i got the post of coach because of Sourav, but that does not mean that he will continue to favor Sourav all his life
 is bare main poochne par ganguli ne kaha, ‘‘kya aisa tha
 '' is khulaase par hairaani jataate hue ganguli ne ek channel se kaha, ‘‘maine isse pehle iske bare main nahin suna
 This must have happened between the chapel and Sachin behind closed doors
 lekin main maanata hum ki yah sach tha or mujhe lagata he ki yah bilkul bevakoofana tha
 '' ganguli ne kaha ki chapel par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 He said, "I lost my captaincy in November 2005, December 2005 and the World Cup was in early 2007
 rahul captain bana
 And eight months later he needed another captain (as Sachin)
 yah uske vichaaron ko darshata he
 It shows how much damage he has caused to Indian cricket
 yah vyakti ke charitra ko darshata he
 He was someone who could not be trusted, be it Ganguly, Dravid or Tendulkar
 ’’ Ganguly hoped that one day he too would be able to tell his side of the story
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kaaphi chijen likhi gai (mere bare main) or maine apni captaini ganvaa di
 Later i returned to the team and played for India but it was not good enough
 ’’ Ganguly said, "I am happy that a person of such credibility as Sachin said this
 ummid karata hum ki ek din main bhi kahani kaa apana paksh rakh paaungaa

 If Rahu is seated in the fifth house then Pitradosh is formed in the horoscope and the person's fate does not rise
 yogyata or kathin mehnat ke baad bhi us vyakti ko safalataa nahin mil paati hai
 He keeps falling into some new problem every day

 - Chant the Gayatri Mantra 108 times in the morning with a garland of red sandalwood
 - apni aay main se kuch naa kuch daan punya ke liye bhi jarur nikaalen
 The horoscope of the horoscope also adds fortune to the problem - in the second and twelfth house of the Moon in the birth chart, there is no auspicious planets like Mars, Mercury, Guru, Venus, and there is no Chemdrum Yoga
 - kundali main kemdrum yoga ke dushprabhav ke kaaran vyakti kitni bhi mehnat kyon naa karen vah safal nahin ho paata he
 - Such a person would like to be born in a rich man's house, but he gradually becomes impoverished

 - Due to the side effects of this yoga, a person's fate does not rise and there is instability in the work area
 vivaah main deree ho jaati he tathaa dhan kii sthiti din prati din kharaab hoti jaati hai
 Remedy- To reduce the side effects of this yoga, light a lamp of cow's ghee in front of Lord Shiva every Monday and Saturday
 - safed mithai kaa bhagwaan shiv ko bhoga lagaakar jaruratmand bacchon main baant den
 - Chant ॐ Namah Shivaya Mantra 108 times after evening in the evening with a rosary of Rudraksha

 ' Former Indian fast bowler Venkatesh Prasad does not understand why Ishant Sharma is still learning about his bowling even though he should have led the pace attack
 srilanka ke khilaaf kiya acha pradarshnaishanth ne srilanka ke khilaaf haal main samaapt hui siries main acha pradarshan kiya lekin apane 65 test match ke kariyar main unhen utaar chadhaav se guzarana padaa
 Prasad, who was the bowling coach of India's national team, said, "it is beyond my understanding
" vah lambey samay se khel rahaa he or ab bhi apni gendbaaji ko samaj rahaa he
 He should undoubtedly lead the Indian fast bowling attack
 use na sirf lagaataar gendbaaji kii aguwai kerani chahie balki team ke anya tej gendbaajon main bhi aatmavishvaas bharna chahie
 Ishant's average is not very good, although Ishant has become India's fourth fast bowler to complete 200 Test wickets but his average is 36
 51 he
 His performance in odis is even better, with 31 from 76 matches
 51 kii ausat se 106 wicket liye
 Ishant should have faith on qualification
 Prasad, who played 33 Tests and 161 odis for India, said, "ishant has been with the team for a long time
 anubhav ko dekhte hue use beparwaah gendbaaji kerani chahie
 He should have a lot of confidence in his qualifications but i don't see that consistently
 yadi aap lambey samay se khelte to aapako yah aatmavishvaas dikhaane kii jarurat hoti he
 The second thing is that you have to instill this confidence in other bowlers
 yah uski bhoomika honi chahie
 "ishant has to be shown," he added on what should be the role of Ishant's team, "the wickets are the result
 maine use niyamit rup se aatmavishvaas ke saath gendbaaji karte hue nahin dekha
 His confidence will increase when he takes a wicket
 yah sabhi par lagu hota he
 But a player like Ishant who has played so many matches should be confident in every situation and should not be worried about wickets
 'nirantar acha pradarshan karnaa hogishanth ne srilanka main prabhaavshaalee gendbaaji kii lekin teen maichon kii siries main vah apane kharaab vyavhaar ke kaaran adhik charchaa main rahe
 Prasad is happy that Ishant has started bowling well again but he still needs to perform consistently well
 unhone kaha, 'unka majboot paksh ballebaaj ko baikfoot par khilne ke liye majaboor karnaa he
 But one needs to mix them up by putting two full length balls
 unhen ballebaaj ko front foot par bhi laana hoga
 This will make them more effective
 'khel bhaavana se hi khelnaa hogishanth ke vyavhaar ke bare main prasad ne kaha, 'aap aakraamakata kii seemaa nahin laangh sakate
 You have to play the game spiritually
 aapako aachaar samhita kaa paalan karne kii jarurat he kyonki bahut se bachche aapako dekh rahe hote hai
 Controlled aggression is needed
 use adhik aakraamak hone ke bajaay apane kaushal or ballebaaj ko out karne par dhyaan dena chahie
 He has played more than 60 Test matches and needs to behave that way

 is par keval vidhi visheshgy hi charchaa kar sakate hai kyonki yah saaf he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne dilli ucch nyaayalay kaa faisla barkaraar rakhaa he
 However, the CBI counsel, while welcoming the judgment of the 14-year-old case, said that the investigating agency was satisfied that the decision of the Delhi High Court was upheld
 yah dekhte hue ki rasookh vaale kaidi umr kaid kii sajaa ke baavjood jaldi chhot jate hai, mattu ke pita ne kaha ‘yah spasht nahin he ki sajaa kii avadhi kya hogi
 'he said that there are many instances when the convicts got released
 unhone kaha ‘yah khatarnaak he
 The Supreme Court did not consider the case the way it should have been done
 ’nyaay kii khatir ladane main samaaj se mili sahyog ke liye mattu ne aabhaar vyakt kiya
 Mattoo's lawyer Ashok Bhan said that he would complete the verdict by filing a revision or remedial petition seeking an extension of the sentence
 unhone kaha ‘vah ek aam apradhi nahin he isliye yah maamla durlabh se durlabhtam shrenee kaa he
 Bhan termed the verdict a shock to Mattoo's family

 unhone kaha ‘‘main raahat mahasoos kar rahi hum ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne ucch nyaayalay kaa faisla nahin badla
 As far as reducing the death penalty to life imprisonment is concerned, i do not know under what circumstances this was done
 ’’ neelam ne kaha ‘‘agar doshi ko vyavastha ko jhansa na dene diya jaae to umr kaid kii sajaa bhi kam nahin hoti
 Our country is not mature enough to allow the guilty to take advantage of the exemption

 unhone kaha ‘jo hua, vah bahut sakaaratmak he
 This will restore people's confidence in the judiciary
 kaha nahin ja saktaa ki kin paristhitiyon main sajaa ghatai gai
 He, however, said that the sentence of life imprisonment does not diminish as the convict regrets his lifetime but he cannot come out of jail
 krishnamurthi ne kaha ‘pichley kuch varshon main bahut hi kam logon ko maut kii sajaa di gai
 There are more number of convicts who are to be sentenced to death

 is vivaad ke baad kai log iskaa virodh kar rahe hai or bacchon ko bhi jaagruk karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 After this controversy, people on social media say that children are also required to be told about Bad Touch and Good Touch, so that they themselves can resist that objectionable act
 haal hi main soshal media main ek teacher kaa video viral hua tha, jisamen ek teacher ko bacchon ko bed tach or good tach ke bare main bataa rahi thim
 Similarly, it is necessary to tell children about Good Touch and Bad Touch
 bacchon ko yah jaankaree mata-pita, teacheron kii ore se diya janaa chahie
 Let's know what things should be told to the children
 
 
 bataaen kya he bed tach or good tachabacchon ko sabase pehle unhen ye bataanaa chahie ki bed tach kya hota he or good tach kya hota he
 Therefore, you should not only tell them about it, but try to explain it to them in a practical manner, so that they can understand easily
 kaamyaab bijnesaman banane ke liye chhodani hongi ye aadatenbed tach-jab koi aapako is tarah se tach kare ki aapako usase bura lage yaa aap sahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai to ye bed tach ho saktaa he
 Also, if an unknown person tries to touch you privately or in many other places, then it is a bad touch
 vahiin agar koi aapke saath galat harakat kare or bole ki kisi ko bataanaa mat, to ye bed tach hota he
 Good Touch - If someone touches you and makes you feel good, then it is a good touch
 koi aapako pyaar karne ke liye madad karne ke liye aapako tach karata he to aap ise good tach kahenge
 Talk about private parts Whenever you tell children about bad touch, openly tell them about private parts too
 unhen bataaen ki sharir kii koun-koun si jagah par sirf maa-baap hi tach kar sakate hai
 If someone else does this then it is wrong
 isamen unhen ye bhi bataaen ki koi jabardastee aapako kis karata he to ye bhi galat he
 Know what habits can make successful and rich people molest the clothes
 Tell the wrong children that it is wrong if someone other than your house tamper with clothes
 ghar par bhi koi clining ke liye hi aapke kapade khole to maa kar den
 Give example of animals
 Tell the children the way you touch an animal and if it feels bad, if it bites or yells at you, then you should also protest against it
 turant karen shikayatabacchon ko bataaen ki agar koi bed tach karata he yaa koi galat harakat karata he to turant aap apane mummy-papa ko jarur bataaen
 Also start shouting there at that time

 a day after the rebellion by the MP, Naidu has reacted strongly to this
 tedepa pramukh ne sabhi mantriyon tathaa party netaaon ke saath ek telicranference kiya
 According to TDP sources, Naidu said that the MP was interested in a plot and when he was not given that, he started making unfounded allegations
 naidu ne ye spasht kiya ki wo kisi ke vyaktigat agenda ko bardaasht nahin karenge
 At the same time, Shivprasad dismissed the allegations against him
 loksabhaa sadsy ne kaha ki asti-essi se nyaay karne kii jagah mujhapar vyaktigat aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 He expressed displeasure over Naidu's attitude towards him, saying that the TDP chief did not give him time to meet

 Naidu is an MLA from Kuppam in Chittoor Lok Sabha constituency
 saansad ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki naidu ne essi ko jansankhya anupaat ke hisaab se apane mantrimandal main jagah nahin di
 He pointed out that the SC and ST population in Andhra Pradesh is around 25 per cent of the population and therefore four ministers should have been made from this community, but they have made only two ministers

 ' soshal media par prerak vaakya ke saath ek post viral ho rahi he ki pehle saal main coca-cola kii sirf 25 bottlen biki thim
 The Facebook page "flatmates Africa" shared the post, writing, "whenever you feel bad, remember that coca-cola sold only 25 bottles in the first year
 kabhi haar mat maano!”india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki viral post main kiya gaya daawa galat he
 coca-cola was first served in a glass, not in a bottle
 iske alaava, atlanta main iske bazaar main aane ke pehle saal isaki ausat bikri pratidin 9 serving thi
 The archived version of the post can be viewed

 The Chief Minister of Delhi said that the business is 'slowing down' and there was no increase in the salaries of the people, while their expenses are increasing, in such a situation, the Government of Delhi provided a lot of help to the people of Delhi, so that they could face the economic recession
 Do not feel prickling unhone kaha, 'hamane 200 unit tak kaa bijli bill maaf kar diya
 We provided free water and waived our old water bills

 agin tiriarbindra bharatiradhakrishna prakaashan, dariyaganj,nai dilli-02,keemtah 200 ru
 Creator of mystery folk: Ravindra bharaticompany Ustad's famous playwright Rabindra Bharati's new play Agin Tiriya is like entering a mystery world
 ek ajaani or aparichit-si vicitra duniya, uske ajanabi-ajeeb log, logon ke adbhut kisse or haroonges jivan-prasang, jo achaanak kisi kaundh kii tarah chamakkar hamaare apane or aasapaas ke lagane lagate hai
 The playwright has a tilism-like tie that opens in front of the reader (audience) and surprises him
 uski tridhara main mukhyatah teen samooh hai-ek devputron yani sanyasi mahapurohit kaa samooh he, jo pavitra agni kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran dharm, gyaan, shakti or prakaash kii satta kaa swami he
 The second group is the excommunicated Kulangars excluded from the social system of these ascetic priests and the third is the child of the 'hhi-pipri' (first male and female of creation) whom the ascetics and kulangars kill and enslave in their own way
 isi tisare samooh main maujuuda vyavastha se vidroh karne kii shakti or agni ko praapt karne kii mahatvakanksha he
 In the same class, Sua is teaching her friends in protest and instead of killing the tiger of the symbolic Gach for the ritual of Baghmara by becoming her mother Matya Manimai, 'the bloodthirsty, man-made, malevolent, green-haired with blood' , Who destroys fragrances and dreams and eats the present and future, recognizes the real 'tiger', the killer of humanity and resolves to kill him
 naatakkaar sua ko agin tiria (agni-nari) maanata he
 But the real lead in the play is Tirya Sua's mother Matya
 vahi sanyasiyon ke agni-abhishek-utsav ke antim din unke abhedya suraksha-vyuh ko bhedakar sanyasi purohit arany kii hatya karke uske haathon se pavitra agni ko chin leti he
 Towards the end of the play, Matya escapes in the forest and in the villages, and despite all the efforts of the ascetic priests, Agni succeeds in making the fire public
 yaheen yah katha greek kii vishwa prasiddh pramathyu-gaatha se aage nikal jaati he
 Pramuthyu brings Agni to 'steal' Agni from the olims for the welfare of human society, while Matya 'snatches' him with his power
 agni prakaash bhi he, gyaan-vigyaan-takanic bhi or dharm bhi
 Like today's nuclear-power-rich and tech-rich countries, the saint of this drama also feels that "what would happen to religion if mother fire became public?" What will happen to our power? Who will eat fear from us? ”the ruling and cruel are extremely weak and fearful from within
 isiilie hatyare sanyasi purohiton kii tarah kulangaar bhi koyal kii madhur kook tak ko chunauti maanakar uski gardan marod detaa he or yah samajhkar aashwast ho jaataa he ki usne chunauti khatm kar di
 Only then does the cuckoo from somewhere break its illusion
 shoshak or atyaachaari kitna bhi praytn kar le, virodh or vidroh ke swar kabhi khatm nahin hote
 This drama is a continuous struggle story between the third world and tribal, forest dwellers and tribal communities
 isamen nari shakti or nari swatantry ko bhi naatakkaar ne rekhaankit kiya he
 The mother who brought fire, is not ready to accept that the woman only understands the means of bearing children
 is saahsee, nirbhay or drudh-sankalp nari ke samvedansheel maatrutiv rup ko bhi naatakkaar ne badi sookshmata se chitrit kiya he
 The saints' dialogue that "we don't even know who else we are killing?" Reveals an eternal and universal blind terrorist mentality, not in the context of a particular country
 sanyasi purohit dekhte hi maar dete hai or kulangaar tadapaa-tadapaa kar maarthe hai
 The playwright also specializes in the art of kissagoi
 kissa chaahe hihadi-pipadi kaa ho, yuva brahman or apsara kaa, unchaas pawan ke janm kaa, jugnu pakadaaey kaa yaa pipeehari bajaane vaale sevak kii jeebh kaat lene kaa-naatak kii rochakata ko badhaata he
 The playwright has provided them with a dialogue rhythm suited to the characters
 udhaaharan ke liye matya kaa yah samvaad drashtavy he-''taron kii duniya sahit vilupt he chandramaa
 There is not even the light of the fire that springs automatically in the dense forest
 
 
 
 There is no mere application of 'no' and 'somewhere'
 raat der tak ghar na lautne vaali jawan beti ke prati chintaa bhi he or bhay bhi
 Many such experiments have been done in drama
 agin tiria kaa sansar bahut bada he
 It includes various classes of people-society, varna-forest, gandharva and root-conscious nature
 aadim vishwaason, lok-kathaon, khelon, nrityon, geeton or puja anushthanon kaa naatakkaar ne dilachasp or sarthak istemaal kiya he
 Color tips like the chariot and chhaya-natya of Gandharva Kanya Sakha made from the body of the actor also make the drama visible
 rabindra bharti ke is naatak kii shaktishaalee visheshta he isaki aanchalikta
 This is what makes the play authentic, believable and lively
 yahi isaki sabase badi seemaa bhi he
 The meanings of certain words are given in the footnote
 par 'upakroshta' or 'udvrutt' jaise clisht shabdon se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 Habib Tanveer was repeatedly reminded of this drama while reading
 aaj se das saal pehle 'nayaa theatre' ke lok kalakaaron ke saath ise habib sahab ne prastut kiya hota to yah ek ghatana hoti
 Yet it is an important composition of contemporary Hindi drama

 We asked many historians how queens of that time wore jewelry
 padmavati: gym ne liye 70 lakh, jaane deepika, shahid, ranvir kii feesraani padmini ke gahane bananaa kitna mushkil kaam tha, iskaa pataa isi baat se chalata he ki ise banane ke liye 200 kaarigaron ne 600 dinon tak kaam kiya
 For this 400 kg gold was molded
 gahanon main bahut se stones lagaae gaye
 There were 5 artisans for every piece of Kundan and Meenakari work
 raajapootaana culture mor, ghode, hathi kii theme par bani gahanon par focus karti thi
 Karan Johar on Padmavati, 'my silence is fine, it will be said that not only the jewels of Brahmandipika were not only heavy, but their costumes were also very heavy
 darasal, jari ke kaam kii vajah se unka vajan zyada he
 Deepika has shot long and heavy costumes
 deepika ko rani padmavati banane ke liye kam se kam 1 ghanta lagata tha
 Principal Economic Advisor Kaushik Basu advocated the freeing of diesel prices from government control, saying that this would ultimately reduce inflation
 mudrasphiti kii 5 pratishat se kam kii dar ko adarsh sthiti mana ja saktaa he
 He said, 'I personally believe that we should free the price of diesel from government control, which will reduce the fiscal burden slightly and will reduce inflation in the long run

 Basu is also the chairman of the committee formed by the Prime Minister on inflation
 unhone kaha, ‘dijal kii keemat ko sarkari niyantran se mukt karne par bharat paryaavaran ke lihaaj se zyada jimmedaar desh ban saktaa he
 Because then the consumption of environmentally friendly energy alternatives instead of subsidized diesel will be encouraged
 ’ mudrasphiti ke bare main unhone kaha ki ise neeche laana praathamikta he
 He said, 'I would like inflation in India to be brought down firmly below five per cent
 darasal main chaar fisad kaa lakshya chaahunga
 Basu, however, admitted that it would be difficult to keep inflation down to five per cent by the end of the current financial year
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin agle saal (2012) ke ant tak kabhi yadi ham paanch fisadi yaa isse kam ke str par pahunch jaaen to acha rahegaa
 'the central bank expects inflation to fall to seven per cent by the end of March

 Akshay Kumar's film 'padman' is scheduled to release on January 25
 film mensturesnal hygin par he
 Periods are considered a taboo in our country
 log khulkar is mudde par baat nahin karte
 Akshay himself did not know about this until he was 20 years old
 ek intervyuu main unhone bataaya- main kareeb 19 saal kaa tha, jab mujhe is bare main pataa chalaa
 i had never taken the pad in my hand
 mere parivaar main kisi ne bhi mujhe sanetary napkin kharidne ke liye nahin kaha tha
 i came to know about this in detail only in the last two years
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki jab mahilaon ko periods hota he to unhen achhut samajha jane lagata he
 She cannot go to the temple, go to the kitchen, wash her hair
 kai ladakiyon ko skool bhi chhodana padataa he
 Padman's new song release, Akshay Kumar, who is learning to dream big, said, "I was very surprised when i came to know that women used to use mud, ash and dirty clothes in periods
" yah bahut shwking tha
 i met some foreigners and when they came to know that we did not know about sanitary napkins, Lo Hans was laughing
 pedman hamaare desh ke liye ahm film he
 No one has made a film on this issue
 yahaan tak ki jo documentries maine dekhi, usamen bhi sanetary napkin ko nahin dikhaaya gaya
 Akshay believes that periods should not be called sensitive issues
 yah sharir kaa natural process he
 The time has come for us to leave behind the taboo associated with it and discuss this subject wisely
 mahilaon ko bhi is mudde par baat karne se nahin sharmaana chahie

 bhartiya test team ke captain viraat kohli ne jab se team india ke liye khelnaa shuru kiya he wo lagaataar charchaa main bane rahete hai
 Whether it is his smoke batting or his aggressive attitude adopted on the field
 shant he ballaakai baar viraat ko unke ati aakraamak ravaiye ke liye aalochana kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he
 But Virat is so great, where does he listen to anyone
 wo to apni hi masti main rahete hai or team india ke is yuva turk captain ko charchaaon main rahanaa bakhubi aata he
 Let us tell you that the century against Pakistan in the last World Cup was Kohli's last century, which has been nearly 6 months
 jabardast he viraat kii fain folovingin gujarey maheenon main kohli ne apane balle se ek bhi badi pari nahin kheli he
 In 2015, Kohli has 31 in 15 innings of 15 odis so far
 50 kii ausat se maatr 378 ran banaae hai
 During this time he has scored just one century
 lekin is pradarshan ke baad bhi kohli kii fain foloving par koi asar nahin padaa he
 Well, it does not matter much to Kohli because he knows that he holds the rank of noor-e-nazar for Team India as well as for the priests of cricket in India
 towel main dikhe captain kohlishayad isiilie jahaan team ke saare log team india ke srilanka daure ke ekmaatr practice match main ballebaajon ke kharaab pradarshan par chintit the vahiin kohli aaraam se stadium kii balakani main salmaan khan ke andaaj main towel lapete najar aae
 Kohli's six pack abs and fit body rotating in tow attracted everyone's attention, seeing that Kohli's stunning body is inspired by Ronaldo
 kyonki ye to sabhi jaanate hai ki kohli star footballar christiano ronaldo ke fain hai jo ki prithvi ke sabase feet athlete maane jate hai
 Kohlikoholi is a big fan of Ronaldo, Ronaldo is such a big fan that when Ronaldo played for Manchester United in the EPL, Kohli supported Manu
 lekin jaise hi ronaldo ne spanish lig kii team riyal madrid jwine kii, turant ha kohli kii fevorett team bhi badalakar riyal madrid ho gai, or har fain kii tarah wo bhi apane hero kii tarah feet and fine dikhnaa chaahate hai
 Kohli, who was walking freely in the balcony of the stadium, did not look a little tense about his form
 form vaapasi pakkiur ho bhi kyon naa ye to har kisi ko pataa he ki apana dilli kaa chhora form main waapas aane ke liye bas ek ining kaa wet kar rahaa he
 And history is witness that whenever the out-of-form Kohli starts playing against Sri Lanka, it is as if there is some divine power in him and he returns to the evergreen form that has become his identity
 hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ko yahi lagata he ki jitna zyada parafum lagaayenge, utani der tak khushboo bani rahegi
 but it's not like that
 parafum kii khushboo kaa quantity se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 There are some special rules for applying perfume
 aamtaur par hamen unke bare main pataa hi nahin hota he, jisaki vajah se parafum lagane ke kuch ghante baad hi khushboo feeki pad jaati he
 If you face a similar situation every day, then it becomes important that you know the right way to use perfume
 in tips ko dhyaan main rakhkar parafum lagaayenge to uski khushboo lambey samay tak bani rahegi
 1
 parafum ko aisi jagah par nahin rakhen jahaan nami yaa sillen ho
 If you want the fragrance of your perfume to last for a long time, do not forget it in the bathroom
 nami or garmi donon hi khushboo ko halkaa kar dete hai
 Keep the perfume in a dry and cool place
 2
 If your skin is dry, your body perfume will not last long
 aise main body parafum lagane se pehle moishcharizer lagaana sahi rahegaa
 You can also apply petroleum jelly if you want
 
 After that, by applying perfume, its fragrance will remain for a long time
 3
 Many people rub it after applying perfume
 aisa karne se parafum kii khushboo kuch der main hi gaayab ho jaati he
 4
 puure sharir main parafum lagane se behatar he ki aap sharir ke un hisson par iskaa istemaal karen jo tulanaatmak rup se garm hote hai
 Use it exclusively on the wrist, the inner part of the elbow, behind the ears, and on the neck
 5
 If you want your perfume to spread its fragrance for a long time, do not forget to compromise quality even if you forget
 quality se samjhauta karke aap kuch paise bhale bachaa len lekin rigelt aapako manmutabik shaayad hi mil sake
