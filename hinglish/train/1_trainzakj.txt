 SP President Akhilesh Yadav is in the fray from Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat
 chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din akhilesh shuukravaar ko chaar jansabhaayen karne vaale the, jise nirast kar diya gaya
 The SP alleged that the BJP had misused the power and pressurized the administration to revise the spending rates two days before the voting and canceled Akhilesh Yadav's public meetings
 azamgarh jiladhikari ne shuukravaar ko is par safai dete hue saare aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya
 In such a situation, what is the reason why Akhilesh Yadav's rallies have been canceled
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din azamgarh ke siyaasi mizaaj ko apane paksh main karne ke liye shuukravaar ko chaar reliyaan kerani thi
 Among these, SP had planned to hold one meeting each in Sagdi, Azamgarh Sadar, Gopalpur and Mehanagar assembly constituencies
 jinhen guuruuvaar ko nirast kar diya gaya
 The SP described it as a collusion of administration and power
 haalanki sapa ne reliyon ke nirast ke liye jis tarah ke tark die hai
 The District Magistrate of Azamgarh issued a press release clarifying the entire matter and said that the SP itself has canceled the rallies
 na to reliyon ko cancil kiya he or na hi chunaav kharch kii purv nirdhaarit daron ko sanshodhit kiya gaya he
 The Election Commission of India has spent 70 lakh for the election of MP
 sutron kii maane to chunaav ayog kii taraf kharch kii jo seemaa nirdhaarit kii he, azamgarh main sapa pratyaashee akhilesh yadav uske kareeb kharch kar chuke the
 In such a situation, if Akhilesh Yadav did four public meetings on Friday, then the fixed amount could be exceeded
 iske chalate unki mushkilen bad jaati 
 Keeping all these things in mind, the SP itself has decided to cancel the rallies
 jiladhikari ne shivakant dvivedi ne kaha, 'azamgarh main akhilesh yadav kii chaaron jansabhaon main se kisi bhi jansabha ko jiladhikari yaa upjiladhikari dwaara nirast nahin kiya gaya he
 Akhilesh Yadav's chief election agent Rajbahadur Yadav on Thursday informed that the proposed Akhilesh Yadav rally in the four assembly of Azamgarh has been canceled
 aise main shuukravaar kii jansabhaon ke liye helipad ke liye helicopter landing ke liye lee gai anumati ko tatkaal nirast kar di jaae
 'it is worth noting that SP District President of Azamgarh, Havaldar Yadav, on Thursday alleged that the district administration, under the pressure of power in the hope of defeat, is looking for an excuse to cancel the election in technical terms, especially the district administration
 isiilie prachaar samaapt hone main do din shesh rahete chunaav mad main hone vaale kharch kii purv nirdhaarit daron ko sanshodhit kar diya gaya he
 Whereas the District Officer said today that no election expenses have been amended in any way
 darasal sapa ke jiladhyaksh hawaldaar yadav ne yah bayaan azamgarh main narendra modi kii raily ke baad saamne aayaa tha
 In such a situation, it is believed that he played this game in favor of the political atmosphere in favor of SP and garner sympathy for the BJP through Modi's rally in Azamgarh
 sapa netaa saaf taur par yah nahin kah sakate the ki chunavi kharch kii nirdhaarit seemaa ke zyada khatre kii vajah se reliyaan cancil karai gai hai
 By saying this, the game could have backfired for the SP, because the SP president has held only two public meetings in Azamgarh so far
 pehali unhone namakan ke dauraan or doosraa buudhvaar ko mayawati ke saath sanyukt jansabha ko sambodhit kiya tha

 modi ne board ke adhyaksh shashaank manohar ko ek chitthee likhi he jisamen unhone kaha he ki shashaank manohar en shrinivasana ko modi ke khilaaf jaanch karne vaale panel main nahin hona chahie
 Modi said that he wants to inquire with the Board President on many matters
 modi kaa kahana he ki manohar ne hi kochi kii team kharidne main madad kii thi
 Modi has also alleged that the Board President was well aware of the dispute over broadcasting rights with Sony and the subsequent agreement

 modi chaahate hai ki ek swatantra vyakti se is baat kii jaanch karai jaae ki unhen kaise hataaya gaya tathaa unhen kaise kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya
 On the other hand, the BCCI said that all the allegations leveled by Modi are baseless and have been answered earlier also
 or agar koi jawaab dena he to wo uchit samay or uchit sthaan par diya jayega
 The board also says that such allegations reflect Modi's frustration

 The environment ministry has started preparing for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup to be held in October in Delhi, so that the air pollution does not fall
 isi silsile main kendriya paryaavaran mantri doctor harshavardhan ne baithak kii
 In this meeting, officials of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi were asked to take necessary steps to curb air pollution
 doctor harshavardhan ne kaha kivaayu pradooshanpar lagaam lagane ke liye sardiyon ke dauraan is pradooshan ko badhaava dene vaali chizon par abhi se dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 According to Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan, the help of CSIR scientists will be taken to curb air pollution and they will be asked to provide the latest technology
 unke mutabik is disha main logon kii bhagidaari par bhi jor dene kii jarurat he
 It would be difficult to achieve the desired results without people's participation
 doctor harshavardhan ke mutabik jaivik eendhan or fasalon ko jalaane se rokane, fasalon ke avshesh ke behatar prabandhan, dhul bhari sadakon par pani ke chhidkaav, nirmaan sthalon par dhul se bachaane ke tareeke or fasalon ko jalaane se rokane jaise kadamon ko apnaane se vaayu pradooshan kii rokthaam kii ja sakati he
 The environment minister said that we should focus on the implementation of all the long-term plans set by the central government
 jisase pradooshan ko har level par kam kiya ja sake
 He asked the states of NCR to work on the basis of various levels of pollution, Dr
 Harsh Vardhan said that in view of the FIFA Under-17 World Cup and Diwali, the air pollution should be tightened from now
 darasal, sardiyon ke sijan ke dauraan dilli-ensiaar menvaayu pradooshanaka level khatarnaak str par pahunch jaataa he or haalat yahaan tak ho jaati he ki logon ko saans lene main takalif hoti he
 The problem has been steadily increasing over the years
 paryaavaran mantri doctor harshavardhan bhale hi vaayu pradooshan ko ek chintajanak cheez maanate hon lekin dilli-ensiaar ke aasapaas ke rajyon ke vyavhaar se aisa nahin lagata
 For example, the environment ministers of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi were to participate in the meeting, but no environment minister from all these states came to attend the meeting
 jab is bare main doctor harshavardhan se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki aisi baat nahin he
 Top officials from every state are participating in this meeting and a second meeting will be called soon

 The festival of Shri Krishna Janmashtami is celebrated with joy and gaiety all over the country
 is din log vrath rakhte hai, tarah-tarah ke pakwaan banaate hai or apane gharon main choti-choti jhaankiyaan sajaate hai
 These tableaux portray Kanhaiya's child form and the events that took place during that time in different ways
 lekin sabase khaas hoti he mandir kii sajaavat, jahaan nanhe bal-gopal kii puja kii jaati he
 If Janmashtami preparations are being done in your house too and the temple part is not decorated yet, then these tips will be very helpful for you
 1
 Decorate the temple with flowers
 jitne zyada rang ke phool mil saken, utana acha rahegaa
 Decorate the inside of the temple with yellow flowers of marigold
 2
 Buy colorful curtains
 laal, pile, nile yaa phir golden color ke parde se mandir ke pichley hisse ko dhak den
 This will cover the back and will also look beautiful
 3
 Apply Mogre garlands on the outer side
 isse mandir ke chaaron orkhushboo bani rahegi,wo bhi lambey samay tak
 4
 mandir kii safai kar, nichle hisse par koi chamkila paper chipka den
 After this, clean the idols of God and place them in an order
 dhoop or agarbatti kaa stand bich main rakhen
 Before puja, decorate the offerings and the rest of the puja in a large puja thali
 5
 The selection of clothes should be good for Kanhaiya
 chatak rangon vaale or gotapattee ke kaam vaale kapade hi aaj ke din sundar lagenge
 Also buy a small crown for bal-gopal
 aap chahen to phulon se bhi mukut taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Don't forget to put peacock feathers in the crown
 6
 You can decorate the swings prepared for Kanhaiya with flower sticks and knots
 jhule ke bheetar rakhane ke liye malamal kaa kapadaa hi sabsiichha rahegaa
 7
 agar jagah ho to bijli vaale jhaalar bhi laga sakate hai
 When Rahul Gandhi's rally ended in Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, within five minutes bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi rode in a red helicopter and reached for a rally in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh
 hameshaa kii tarah unhone pehle raily sthal kaa mahatv bataaya
 It said that he has worked here as an organization general secretary and claimed that the weather of India, that is, the political season is changing rapidly
 vot bank kii raajnneeti, indian mujahidin ko tathakthith sangrakshan or sibiai kaa durupyog is baar modi ke bhaashan ke centre main rahaa
 However, he also repeated the Gujarat development story
 chhattisgarh kii tarah baharich main bhi vah patna dhamaakon par sahanubhuti batorna nahin bhuule
 From the political 80-seat Uttar Pradesh, Modi also appealed to reach the magic figure of the majority party
 unhone kaha, 'log raajnneetik asthirataa ke sawaal khadey karte hai
 If Uttar Pradesh alone decides, it can give a stable government in India
 'gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'main anurodh karne aayaa hum, yahi vah bhoomi he jisane hindustan ko hajaaron saalon se gaurav pradaan kiya he
 Today again this land of ganga-yamuna and ram-krishna came to give political stability and progressive government to India
 'modi ne apane bhaashan main sapa, basapa or congress kii baraabar aalochana kii
 He said, 'gotra, DNA and motive of the three parties are the same
 'bina kisi party kaa naam liye unhone ek aisa aarope bhi laga daalaa jo aage chalakar vivaad ko bhi janm de saktaa he
 He said that some people in the country are giving protection to the Indian Mujahideen
 unke shabd the, 'jinhen lagata he ki loktantric tareeke se to bijepi or modi ko roka nahin ja saktaa to unhone duusare tareeke apnaane shuru kar die
 Sometimes put the CBI behind, sometimes give the Indian Mujahideen a free hand
 'bhaashan ke ant main unhone bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa buland karte hue kaha, 'donon mutthiyaan band karke jor se bolie ki indian mujahidin sune to kaanp jaae
 Read the full speech of Modi, this is the taphbhoomi of Brahma
 main is tapobhumi ko pranaam karata hum
 This land has a special place in my life
 bahut kam logon ko pataa hoga ki jab main bijepi kaa sanghathan mahasachiv tha, 2001 main yahaan kii chunavi taiyaariyon ko lekar har vidhansabha kshetra kaa rivyuu karne ke liye main daura kar rahaa tha
 My last show was in Bahraich
 mujhe soochna ai ki main apana kaarykram sthagit karke dilli jaaun
 i did not know why my visit was postponed
 baad main pataa chalaa ki mujhe ab sanghathan mahasachiv kaa kaam nahin karnaa he
 Later the party gave me the responsibility of Chief Minister
 mujhe gujarat janaa padaa
 The last time i worked in Bahraich was as Organization General Secretary
 isliye brahma kii is tapobhumi kaa mere jivan main vishesh mahatv he
 Brothers and sisters, the weather is changing
 (public kii ore se shor kii aawaaj)
 Is changing very fast
 sirf baharich main nahin kashmir se kanyakumari tak puure hindustan kaa mausam badal rahaa he
 (is noisy and loud)
 jo log satta ke nashe main duube hai or satta se mouj le rahe hai, aise sab logon ko ek ek baari sankat kaa ehsaas ho gaya he
 Why are we facing such heavy opposition? Because their power is about to go
 yahi kaaran nahin he, unhen pataa he ki abaki baar agar dilli main bijepi kii sarkaar ban gai to desh ko tabah karne waalon kaa thikaana kahaan hoga, iskaa unhen pataa he
 No one can be given the right to destroy the country
 vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye bayaanbaji kii ja rahi he
 i want to ask the emperors in power in UP
 kya kaaran tha ki aapane bijepi ko badnaam karne ke liye hamaare do vidhayakon ko jail main band kar diya
 And when the judiciary released him, he put another law back in
 ye vot bank kii raajnneeti ke chalate gunahagaaron ko nahin, nirdosh logon ko jail main daalane kaa hatkandaa kar rahe hai
 It seems that those who could not defeat Modi in Gujarat, who had to face defeat in three elections, who could not save their honor, who feel that BJP and Modi cannot be stopped in a democratic way
 Started adopting other methods
 kabhi sibiai ko peeche laga do, kabhi indian mujahidin ko khuli chhot de do
 With the help of bombs, guns and pistols, let the politicians who are doing politics open their ears, we are born of other soil
 (public kaa shor)
 We have not bowed down to the terrorists, nor will we bow down
 unhen saaf karke rahenge
 Innocent citizens should not be oppressed
 himmat he to loktantric tareeke se muqabla karo
 You are stabbing on the back like an old man
 aatankiyon kii goliyaan hindustan ko uski yatra se roak nahin sakati hai
 This country is going to move forward
 bhaaiyon bahanon, mujhe to lagata he ki agle chunaav main congress-sapa or basapa kii tikdi chunaav ke maidan main nahin aegi
 In the next election, i think only the CBI and the Indian Mujahideen will handle the election front to save the Congress
 hamaare bihar ke bhai-bahan chhath puja kaa utsav manaate hai
 But before the same Chhath Puja, the terrorists killed innocent people
 kisi ne apana baap khoyaa, maa ne apana laadla kho diya
 How will we celebrate Chhath Puja? or unka gunaah kya? ki bharat mata kii jai bolte the? or isliye maut ke ghat utaar diya? kya loktantr main hinsa or bandook kii raajnneeti ko jagah hoti he?bhaaiyon-bahanon is desh main loktantr par hamale ho rahe hai
 You will be surprised to know that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has issued an order to the TV media that on August 15, when the Prime Minister was giving a speech from the Red Fort, how did these media people know how they showed the Chief Minister of Gujarat on live TV gave
 piem ke baraabar kaise dikhaa diya
 Order August 15 and ordered just over a week ago
 kyon? kyonki unako pareshaani is baat kii hui ki 27 oktober ko patna main rajnath or modi bhaashan de rahe the or dilli main unke shahjade de rahe the
 And the media people made the mistake that they were showing Shahzade but were not listening
 dikhte bhi the or sunai bhi dete the modi
 With this, the entire Congress party was shocked and issued this order
 bhaaiyon-bahanon, yah hamaara galaa ghontne kaa prayaas he
 But listen to the King of Delhi with open ear
 ham tivi par dikhen yaa nahin, par hindustan kii avam ke dil main apni jagah bana chuke hai
 Brothers and sisters, Congress ruled the country for 60 years
 kya mila aapako? bhaaiyon-bahanon bataaenge mujhe? aapke gaanv main jo garib he 60 saal main uske jivan main badlaav aayaa he? yuvaaon ko rojgaar mila he? kisaan ko pani mila he? biimaar ko dawaai mili he? kya raaj karne waalon ko jawaab dena chahie? ye dete hai? upar se ham par gaali galouj karte hai
 i am surprised, brothers, the state which gave eight prime ministers
 or lakhanu ke 100 kilometre radius main kitne diggaj netaa hai
 What can they not do for the happiness of the people here? i am the Chief Minister of a small state
 agar man main thaan lee to janata kii bhalaai ke pachaas kaam kar sakate hai
 Why don't they do this? How long will these people bear? That is why i have come to say brothers and sisters
 bahut ho chukaa, ab inkaa jane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 The UP that gave birth to four generations of leaders, they left the country, if only they had worked for the development of UP, even then the whole of India would have moved ahead on its own
 yah desh garib deshon main nahin hota
 But they are not interested in anything other than vote bank politics
 indian mujahidin ke adde banate chale jaaen, inako unka sangrakshan miltaa chalaa jaae, desh ke naagarik kii jaan salaamat rahe yaa nahin, inako parvaah nahin
 These people say that Gujarat is already developed
 main aapako bataata hum
 When i became the Chief Minister, people used to say that Modi ji should do something
 shaam ko khaanaa khate samay to bijli do
 Earlier in Gujarat, the mother used to be ill, then the fan would not work
 bachche nahin pard pate the
 i told the officials that 24 hours of electricity is available in Gandhinagar, so why can't it be found in the whole of Gujarat? i wrote on file that 24 hours electricity should be provided
 gujarat vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa hamen milane aae or bole modi ji aap nae ho, aapako shashan kaa anubhav nahin he
 Someone has misled you, you will be trapped, it is not possible
 maine unase kaha, main jaanata hum ki yah kathin kaam he isliye mujhe kursi par baithaaya gaya he
 Today i proudly say that 24 hours of electricity is available even in the villages of Gujarat
 bhaaiyon-bahanon upi main bijli aati he? log yahaan baaten karte the
 Dude, i came here last Tuesday
 wo kahata tha ki mere yahaan pichley hafte ai thi
 Electricity is not going to come in Uttar Pradesh, it is news
 maine suna he ki hamaare noujvaan mukhyamantri ke kshetra main to bijli milti he
 The other is Khan Saheb, electricity is also available in his area
 lekin baaki uttar pradesh kii chintaa kisi ko nahin he
 Friends, the ruler is the one who thinks first of the public, then later if he has anything left to use himself
 yahaan ke mukhyamantri ne mujhe chitthee likhi ki modi ji hamen sher chahie
 They must have thought that Modi roars like a lion
 ham bhi sher le aaenge to ham bhi dahaadenge
 He is fond of the lion, who was the chief minister earlier, he was fond of elephants
 ye line safari bananaa chaahate hai
 i wish the Chief Minister of UP was not just a lion, but a cow of Gir
 vah hamase bijli maangate
 i would like to understand the understanding of dairy network like Amul
 aisi kuch cheez maangate
 Did not ask
 iske liye bhi to samaj chahie
 SP and BSP compete in whose camp is the most criminal
 tumne 2000 karod banaae ham 5000 karod banaaenge
 These are teams that are not interested in competing to solve your good and problems

 This situation can also happen here
 lekin iske liye iraadaa chahie

 # gita Nirmal Chauhan is from Yamunanagar Assembly
 Congress candidate Nirmal Chauhan has to face the factionalism lock in Congress office, Nirmal is not getting entry tikat vitaran ko lekar party netaaon va kaaryakartaaon main baari virodh dikhaai de rahaa he
 On Saturday, while former state president Ashok Tanwar resigned after accusing the party of rigging the ticket distribution, in Yamunanagar, the Mahila Congress candidate faced opposition from her own party workers to the extent that she had to sit on the dharna
 Gone
 congress ne yamunanagar vidhansabha seat se mahila parshad nirmal chouhan ko tikat diya he
 Since getting the ticket, Nirmal Chauhan has been facing infighting
 party daftar pahunchin to laga mila talanirmal chouhan ne 4 oktober ko namakan bharaa or iske baad 5 oktober ko jab wo yamunanagar sthit kareeb 50 saal puraane party ke karyaalay intak bhawan pahunchin, to vahaan taala lataka hua dikhaai diya
 It turned out that this lock was imposed at the behest of the party's top leaders
 yah dekh nirmal chouhan bhadak gayi or vahiin dharne par baith gayi
 Nirmal Chauhan sat on the door of the office, laying the strings and complaining over the phone to the party leadership
 phone par baatcheet ke dauraan nirmal chouhan ne kaha, 'vah kal se bade netaaon ke aage haath jod rahi hai, jis kaaran vah jansampark to dur apane kaaryakartaaon se bhi nahin mil paa rahi hai
 i have even said that if you say, i will catch their feet and what should i do
 'parshad hai nirmal chauhanirmal chouhan yamunanagar ke ward number 13 kii parshad hai
 Nirmal Chauhan's candidature has crushed all political predictions
 yahi vajah he ki unhen tikat ke daavedaar maane ja rahe netaaon va kaaryakartaaon kii taraf sahyog kii jagah virodh mil rahaa he
 Alleged by the Tanwar group leaders, former state president Ashok Tanwar group's local leader Raghubir Singh said that the Congress chapter in Yamunanagar was over
 kumari shailaja dwaara utaare gaye pratyaashee ko bade netaa daftar tak nahin de rahe hai jis kaaran vah daftar ke baahar baithi hui hai
 He said that when the Congress workers are not liking them, then what will the people here vote for them
 raghubir singh ne saaf kaha ki nirmal chouhan congress nahin, kumari shailaja kii pratyaashee hai
 On this tussle in the Congress, BJP candidate from Yamunanagar Ghanshyam Das Arora said that Nirmal Chauhan has contested the election of corporator twice
 magar unke paas aaj tak congress kaa koi bhi daayitv nahin rahaa he
 He has also done nothing for the society and the party and he has no acquaintance with the public nor does he have any attachment among the Congress workers

 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was living in the form of an anonymous monk in many parts of Uttar Pradesh between the 1950s to the 1980s
 britain main vimochit ek kitaab main yah daawa kiya gaya he
 The comments purv patrkaar anuj dhar kii pustak 'whot hepand tu netaji?' main bose ke jivan ke rahasy ke faijabad pahalu par gaur karne se pehle unki maut ke teen pramukh siddhanton kaa byoraa he
 Dhar said, 'A highly placed source in touch with the government told me that the Prime Minister of India had a very secret file in which Bose's secret was hidden
 ' According to this writer, who has been investigating the mysteries associated with Netaji for 15 years, there is a confession in that file that Bhagwanji, the sage of Faizabad was actually Bose and therefore the government kept in touch with him
 dhar ne likhaa he, 'uttar pradesh rajya or kendriya mantriyon sahit guptcharon tathaa khufia adhikari unhen shishtachar ke taur par, vibhinn vishyon par unki salaah lene or un par najar rakhane ke liye bheje jate the
 This book also claimed that the officials manipulated the result of the DNA test of Bhagwanji's tooth

 This book also claimed that the officials manipulated the result of the DNA test of Bhagwanji's tooth
 netaji se jude rahasyon par 15 saal tak chaanbin karne vaale is lekhak ke mutabik us file main yah sweekaarokti he ki faijabad ke sadhu bhagwanji asal main bose the or isliye sarkaar ne unase sampark banaae rakhaa tha
 Dhar wrote, 'detectives and intelligence officers, including Uttar Pradesh state and central ministers, were sent to him as courtesy, to seek his advice on various subjects and to monitor them
 ' is kitaab main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki bhagwanji ke daant kii diene jaanch ke nattejey main adhikariyon ne herpher kiya
 The election without slogans looks like something an army has gone into battle without realizing
 naare hi chunaav abhiyaan main dam or kaaryakartaaon main josh bharne kaa kaam karte hai
 There should be a loud slogan and then there should be a strong secretion of adrenalin in the blood of the people present there
 
 
 phir josh aasmaan chune lagata he
 Every party wants a slogan for itself that will woo voters
 itihaas gavaah he ki kam sansadhano ke baavjood tagade naaron or urjavan bhaashanon ke dam par kai taqatvar pratispardhi chitt kar die gaye hai
 Many electoral slogans have also been disputed, but even today, they are on the tongue of the people to produce unexpected results by creating a wave
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon menek baar phir modi sarkaarek naaraa he, jo bhaajapa aajamaa rahi he
 So shout away the BJP, playing on the slogan of Save the country
 har raajnneetik naaraa apane saath kai kisse lekar chalata he
 During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was in a defensive position, so see its slogans
 'congress kaa haath aam aadmi ke saath'to tha hi
 The then prime ministerial candidate of the BJP, Narendra Modi, was also taunted: 'I do not hum', 'young people are not fanatical,' 'kam bola kam bola'
 jaahir he, kam bolaa kaam bolaa main focus manmohan singh par tha
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP left no stone unturned to capitalize on Modi's popularity
 saare naare modi ke ird-gird hi gum rahe the
 Although not all the slogans for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the entire election campaign is revolving around Modi, for example, once again the Modi government, but in 2014, in the election meetings, the chant of parmodi-modi on the lines of the Mexican Wave is like a mantra of the youth
 You will not forget the scene
 saal 1998 ke chunaav main,'abaki baari atal bihari'kii tarj par party ne 16veen loksabhaa ke liye'abaki baar modi sarkaar'kaa naaraa uchhaala tha
 In Benares, Modi's parliamentary constituency, the slogan 'har har ghar ghar ghar modi' came in such a way that wherever i went to cover the election rally across the country, this slogan was definitely heard
 2009 main slamdog milionair ke auscari ganejay hoka patta congress ko mil gaya tha or bhaajapa ne uske muqablephir bhi jai hoorbhay hojaise naare utaare the
 In the 2004 elections, the BJP was dismantled due to the rise of India and India Shining took the shine off the NDA
 agar ateet main jaakar kuch chunavi naaron par najar daalen to siyasat ke kuch baarik pecho-kham kii thaah lagaai ja sakati he
 Let's start with the slogan of the famous Jai Jawan Jai Kisan of 1965
 tab ke pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne desh kii raksha ke liye javaanon or anaaj kii paidaavaar badhaane ke liye kisaanon ko sarvasv jhonkne ke prati prerit karne ke liye yah naaraa diya tha
 This slogan brought the Congress Party back to power in 1967
 saath ke dashak main lohia ne samaajwaadiyon ko naaraa diya tha,socialiston ne baandhi ganth, pichde paaven sau main saath
 
 
 This was not just a slogan, but the land of Lohia's entire ideology
 us daur main jansangh ne apane chunaav chihn deepak or congress ne apane dau belon kii jodi ke zarie ek duusare par khub nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 The election symbol of the Jana Sangh was Deepak while the Congress was contesting the pair of two bulls during that time
 donon partiyaan apane naaron dwaara ek-duusare par khub nishaanaa sadhti thim
 While the Jana Sangh used to strike the slogan 'jal hut ran bull Jeho yeh lamp ki khel', the counter slogan of the Congress was, 'no oil in this lamp, government formation is not a game'
 usee tarah congress kagaribi hataokanara bhi khub charchit rahaa or bhartiya arthvyavastha or samaaj kii ek zaroorat ne votaron par khaasaa asar daalaa
 At the same time, slogans played an important role in defeating Indira from Rae Bareli
 1977 main jai prakaash narayan ne naaraa diaindira hataao, desh bachaao
 The leaf of the Congressmen who implemented the Emergency was cleared
 janata party kii sarkaar bani thi
 Then a slogan became very popular
 "the land is under consolidation, the house is in the boundary, the woman standing in the door shouts, my man is in the sterilization
" "yaa phir,"jagjivan ram kii ai aandhi, ud jaaegi indira gandhiakash se kahen nehru pukaar, mat kar beti atyadhchaar
 "these slogans were popular during the Emergency and Sanjay Gandhi, although Indira Gandhi won the by-election from Chikkamagaluru on the chariot of slogans
 isi tarah 1980 ke chunaav main kai dilachasp naare gadhe gaye
 Indira Gandhi was contesting by-election from Chikkamagaluru in Karnataka
 us dauraan dakshin bharat ke congress ke netaa devraj urs neek sherni sau langur, chikmagalore, chikmagalureyah naaraa diya tha
 Indira Gandhi made a dramatic comeback in 1980 by winning the by-election
 inamenindira ji kii baat par muhar lagegi haath par, to kai logo kii jubaan par aaj bhi he
 Poverty Hataoka slogan was raised by Indira Gandhi in 1971
 isi naare ke dam par unhone congress ko baari jeet dilaai thi
 When Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, a slogan played a very important role in creating a sympathy wave
 jab tak suraj chand rahegaa indira tera naam rahegaa
 As a result, the Congress won a landslide victory
 congress kii rajeev gandhi sarkaar main vitt mantri rahe vishwanath pratap singh jab baghawat karke vipaksh kii bhoomika main aa gaye to unke liye bhi bahut dilachasp naare gade gaye
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh wanted to become the messiah of the poor, so the slogan was coined to reinforce his image: Raja is not fakir, it is the fate of the country
 989 ke chunaavon main veepi singh ko lekar bana yah naaraa logon kii jubaan par chadha rahaa
 It was only in 1989 that the BJP redeemed the slogans associated with the Ram temple, Saugandh Ram ki Hathi Hain, we will build the temple there, and this is the first tableau after the Babri demolition, Kashi Mathura is the rest (although it was not an election slogan)
 However, slogans to VP Singh i was told to be a fakir and a fortune maker of the country
 lekin congress ne unhe rank or desh kaa kalank bhi bataaya tha
 Rajiv Tera after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991
 ye balidaan yaad karegaa hindustansamne aayaa
 And its effect was also seen on voting
 1998 mekhabaki baari atal biharibijepi ko khub bhaayaa or usne iskaa khub istemaal bhi kiya
 In the 2012 assembly elections in UP, the BSP compared the elephant to Lord Ganesha to woo forward votes
 mul naaraa thahathi nahin ganesh he, brahma bishnu mahesh haito samaajawaadee party nejisne kabhi na jhukna siikhaa uskaa naam mulaayam haise mulaayam ko khub hausala diya tha
 In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, there were wonderful slogans
 samaajawaadee party ke naaron kii kuch baangi he,jiskaa jalawaa kaayam he, uskaa baap mulaayam he
 
 
 The key to victory, Dimple Bhabhi
 
 
 upi kii majaburi he, akhilesh yadav jaruri he
 Another local slogan was Panjaya Gaya Khandanja Pefool Gaya Murajheyathi Fuss Swamp Mesaikil Chaplai Jeevan BSP slogans were created to attract women
 najar daaliye,betiyon ko muskuraane do, bahan ji ko aane doek anya naaraa tha,gaanv-gaanv ko shahar banane do, bahan ji ko aane dois tarahader se nahin haq se vot do, beimaanon ko chot do
 So the Congress was in alliance with SP but its slogans did not gain old popularity, the slogans of Congress were, debt waiver, electricity bill half, 27 years
 
 
 upi behaal,garibon se khincho, amiron ko sincho
 The BJP slogans were probably overshadowed by all
 abaki baar, 300 ke paar, gali-gali main machaa he shor, janata chali bhaajapa kii ore, jan-jan kaa sankalp, parivartan ek vikalp
 And the public reiterated these slogans and gave BJP a strong majority in the state
 upi kii raajnneeti ke khaas naare1
 On the alliance of SP and BSP: mulayam-kanshi Ram met, Jai Shri Ram 2 flew into the air
 bispi kaa charchit naaraa: tilak, taraazoo or talwaar

 punjab chunaavon ko lekar ummiido se bhari aam aadmi party yahaan iviem mashiinon se chhedhkhani kii ashanka jataa rahi he
 Now Jastej Singh Arora, president of the legal cell of the party's Punjab unit, has written to the Election Commission seeking permission for AAP candidates to put their locks outside the strong rooms
 aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki punjab ke lambi vidhansabha kshetra ke wo strang rums jahaan iviem mashine rakhi hai, vahaan punjab congress adhyaksh or lambi se ummidavaar captain amarinder singh ne apane personal taale laga rakhe hai, to aise main aam aadmi party ke ummidavaaron ko bhi strang room ke baahar apane taale lagane kii ijaajat di jaae
 Along with this, the Aam Aadmi Party has demanded that their workers be given permission to sit in a place near the strong rooms, where they can monitor round the clock of the main gate of the strong rooms and the locks on it
 aam aadmi partika kahana he ki congress or akali dal donon hi punjab kii puraani raajnneetik partiyaan hai or ve chunaav jeetne ke liye kisi bhi tarah kii jaalsaji kar sakati hai
 At the same time, the Congress has described this letter of the Aam Aadmi Party as the result of their fury
 congress kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party ko pataa lag chukaa he ki vah punjab chunaav haar rahi he, isi vajah se nattejey ghoshit hone se pehle hi iviem mashiinon ke saath chhedhkhani ke is tarah ke managasaint aarope laga rahi he
 Congress leader Balbir Sidhu says, "there has been no talk of locking locks on behalf of Captain Amarinder Singh in Lambi so far, but even if there is such a provision in the law, the Election Commission should be allowed to send AAP candidates to the strong room They should be allowed to install their personal locks, so that after the results, they cannot say that EVM machines have been tampered with

 Shivpal has now shown the way out of the party to Pawan Pandey, a minister close to CM Akhilesh Yadav
 pawan pandeya ko party se 6 saal ke liye nikaale kii vajah anushaasanheenata bataai gai he
 But the thing to note here is that the indiscipline of which party MLA Ashu Malik has accused is close to Shivpal Yadav
 malik kaa aarope he ki pawan pandeya ne unhen thappad maaraa tha
 After Pawan Pandey was removed from the party, Shivpal has also requested CM Akhilesh that he be thrown out of the cabinet

 rafel maamle main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne piem modi ko chor bataaya to bijepi ne isi ko chunavi hathiyaar bana liya
 When PM Modi put a watchman in front of his name on Twitter, there was a competition among BJP supporters to become 'chowkidar'
 ab dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Kejriwal has said that Modi ji wants to make the whole country a watchman
 agar aap bhi apane bacchon ko chaukeedaar bananaa chaahate hai to modi ji ko vot den
 But if you want to make your children a good teacher, engineer, lawyer, then vote for the Aam Aadmi Party, a party of educated honest people
 modi ji puure desh ko chokidaar bananaa chaahate hai
 If you also want to make your children chokidar, then vote for Modi ji
 par agar aap apane bacchon ko acchhee shiksha dekar doctor, ejeeniyar, vaqeel bananaa chaahate hai to padhe likhe eemaandaar logon kii party aam aadmi party ko vot den— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)march 20, 2019isse pehle mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne itanagar main piem par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki chori aapane kii he to chaukeedaar puraa desh kyon bane
 Irrespective of the opposition's attacks, PM Modi is using the same watchman as an election weapon
 unhone congress ke naare ‘chaukeedaar chor he’ ko chaukidaaron kaa apmaan qaraar diya he
 On Wednesday morning, PM Modi released the next video of the campaign 'main Bhi Chowkidar'
 piem ne video jari kar likhaa ki inhone chaukidaaron kaa apmaan kiya, aaj puraa desh chaukeedaar banakar khadaa he
 The watchman is synonymous with patriotism today
 karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke elaan ke mahaj paanch din baad, may kii 17 taarikh ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi chhattisgarh pahunch gaye the
 It is one of the five states in which assembly elections are to be held this winter
 agle 36 ghanton main unhone rajya main 800 kilometre kii yatra kar daali jis dauraan unhone saarvajanik reliyon ko sambodhit kiya or party kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 This was in contrast to the nature of the descendants of the nehru-gandhi family
 unke pichley record ko dhyaan main rakhen to yah ummid lagaai ja rahi thi ki ve karnataka main behad thakaaoo chunaav-prachaar abhiyaan or nateezon tathaa sarkaar ke gathan kii gahamagahami ke baad thodaa brake lenge
 But this is the new Rahul
 may ke baad se ve congress ke abhiyaan ko majbootee dene ke liye chhattisgarh teen baar, madhya pradesh chah baar or rajasthan teen baar ja chuke hai
 After the partial successes achieved in the elections of Gujarat and Karnataka, the Congress President plans to make a decisive strike in the next three states — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 hindi pattee ke in teen rajyon main agar congress ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se kuch hi maheenon pehle agar jeet mil jaati he to use deshbhar main bhagava lahar se muqabla karne ke liye behad jaruri takat milegi
 These three states and Telangana and Mizoram together have 83 Lok Sabha seats
 congress ne 2014 ke pichley chunaavon main inamen se sirf paanch jiti thim
 The road ahead for Rahul is straightforward — the journey to Delhi should begin with the Congress governments in these states and especially in Jaipur and Bhopal
 unki raah main sabase bada adnga hai—pradhanmantri narendra modi
 In the post-poll analysis in the midst of the strike on a weak vein, several senior Congress leaders had emphasized that the BJP in both Gujarat and Karnataka went ahead due to Modi's aggressive last campaign on one occasion
 lihaaja congress ke liye pehla kaam thah modi kii is bedaag chhavi kaa myth toduya
 Rahul is not new to such an attack strategy anyway
 saal 2016 main unhone "suut-boot kii sarkaar'' kaa taana taiyaar karke modi ke ird-gird kisaan-virdohi hone kaa khaakaa bun diya tha
 Due to this, the Prime Minister was forced to make many policy changes
 is baar to rahul ke haath main kai hathiyaar hai—rafel se lekar neerav modi va vijay maalya tak, jiesti se lekar notebandi tak, berogari se lekar krishi sankat tak, goraksha ke naam par ho rahi hatyaon se lekar daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar tak
 a person close to Rahul said, "ultimately two to four rallies will not make a difference this time
 modi ke liye in saare aaropon ko jhel paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 There is a strong anti-government atmosphere in these states and Modi has already spent all his promises
 ''arthvyavastha ke sankat or sibiai kii uthal-puthal ke maamle ke chalate congress ke haath ko jeet kaa saath mil janaa chahie
 But it is also a matter of regret that many people within the Congress are trying to reverse this story
 madhya pradesh main party teen bade khemon main banty hui he—pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath, prachaar abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh jyotiraditya sindhiya or samanvay samiti ke pramukh digvijay singh
 All three leaders claim that there is complete unity in the party, but (if the Congress wins) both Nath and Scindia are eyeing the Chief Minister's chair
 yahaan bhi party adhyaksh khud hi dames-control ke kaam main lage hai or tamaam aahat ahankaaron ko thanda rakhkar ekajute rahane kii apil kar rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, Rahul made it clear in March on whose side he was, when he appointed Ashok Gehlot as the General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee and put him in charge of organization and training
 sandesh saaf tha ki rajasthan kaa jimmaa sachin payalat ke paas rahegaa
 However, the real challenge for Rahul in the state will come after the elections
 ek congress mahasachiv kaa kahana tha ki "is samay gahalot shant baithe hai
 He will open his cards after the elections
 yadi trishanku vidhansabha chunakar ai to unki sambhaavnaaen payalat kii tulana main behatar hongi
 "this leader also said that Scindia is the first choice of party workers and people in Madhya Pradesh, whereas in Rajasthan, Gehlot is more popular than the pilot
 congress kii ranneeti ko pehle hi ek jhatka mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party se baat nahin ban paane ke kaaran lag chukaa he
 However, the party's figures are happy because they are sure that the support given to Mayawati will cut the votes of the BJP and not the Congress
 madhya pradesh main congress ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana tha, "basapa ko 163 siton par 10,000 se bhi kam vot mili, phir bhi vah 50 siten maang rahi thi
 Mayawati's influence is less than 25 seats
 '' basapa ne 2013 main keval chaar siten jiti thim, lekin vah 21 siton par duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 Obviously, it can hurt the Congress in a close contest
 chhattisgarh main use keval ek seat mili thi lekin 20 se zyada siton par uske voton kii nirnaayak bhoomika jarur rahi
 The Congress is ready to play a lesser role in Telangana and the state incharge R

 mizoram main congress do baar mukhyamantri rah chuke lalathanhawala kii samaj par bharosa karke chal rahi he
 In this northeastern state, the contest is going to be between the Congress and the NDA constituent Mizo National Front (MNF), but this time again the main role will be Himanta Biswa Sarma, who has been the main player in bringing BJP government in the four northeastern states
 congress khaasi satark hokar chal rahi he or ummidavaaron kii jeetne kii sambhaavna ko chayan ke liye mukhya maanak banaaya gaya he
 The attention being paid to every fine thing is clearly visible
 congress adhyaksh or jamini str ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich dohare sampark ko sakasham banane vaale aplicoshan—shakti app ke jariye rahul or unki team chhante gaye ummidavaaron ke bare main feedback le rahi he
 Shakti's feedback has actually played an important role in making many big decisions
 inamen mayawati kii maangon par na jhukne se lekar chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ke liye daravaaje band karne tak ke faisle shaamil hai
 Apart from power, the party has also conducted independent surveys to choose the right candidate
 congress kii ranneeti par antni samiti kii ab tak aprakashit report kaa bhi khaasaa asar he
 This committee was formed after the party's defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sutron ke anusaar, report main kaha gaya tha ki congress ko apni alpsankhyak samarthak va hindu-virdohi chhavi se mukti paane kii jarurat he
 The rise of Shiva-devotee Rahul, his temple-temple worship and the Mansarovar Yatra are all part of a strategy to loosen the hold of the Bharatiya Janata Party on the notion of Hindutva
 jeet ke liye congress adhyaksh ne or bhi kai tabdiliyaan kii hai

 He has held a sudden press conference three times in the last two months and this makes him want to point out that he is ready to face the questions of journalists — unlike Prime Minister Narendra Modi — who has not had a single press during the last four years The conference is not held
 philhal, congress netaa khush hai ki unhone bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ko madhya pradesh va rajasthan main ek kaalpanik shatru kaa avishkaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya he—avaidh musalmaan pravasi
 a member of the Congress Working Committee said, "by presenting migrants as Muslims, Shah is using Hindu cards in states with less than 10 percent Muslim population
 isse saaf hota he ki vah baichaiyn ho rahe hai
 "however, the real advantage of Congress and Rahul Gandhi's strategy to be aggressive on BJP and Narendra Modi will be given when the organization converts it into votes on the ground
" iske liye congress ko samarpit kaaryakartaaon kii jarurat he
 Considering the enthusiasm of Congressmen in electoral states, it seems that this time there is no atmosphere like before
 kaaryakartaaon main josh he jo party kii kismat badal dene kaa madda rakhte philhal dikhaai de rahe hai
 The Congress leaders are happy that they forced Amit Shah to invent the imaginary enemy *** priyanka chopra ke khate main ek or uplabdhi ai he

 ) In today's time, the trend towards children's junk food is a matter of concern
 junk food sirf aapaki sehat ke liye nuksaandaayak nahin he balki aapkaa maansik swasth bhi prabhavit hota he
 Now the junk food that children should avoid, in those social media world, those things are advertised a lot
 ek nai study main ye daawa kiya gaya he ki jo bachche apana zyada samay soshal media par vyateet karte hai, ve sabase zyada junk food khate hai
 According to the study published in Pediatrics, due to the promotion and advertising of junk food on TV and social media, a large number of children are trending towards junk food
 study main is baat par bhi jor diya gaya he food vlog ke badhate chalan ke chalate bachche ab utyub or duusare platerfam par in videon ko dekhte hai
 According to Ofcom's report, 93 percent of children between the ages of 8 and 11 go online, 77 percent use youtube and 18 percent have an account on social media
 vahiin 12 se 15 saal ke umr ke bacchon main 99 pratishat online jate hai, 89 pratishat kaa utyub prayog karte hai or 69 pratishat kaa soshal media par acount he
 Taking the same report as the basis, a study has been done by the New University of Liverpool Research
 us study main 176 bacchon ne bhaag liya he
 Let us tell you, these 176 children were divided into three groups
 ek gupra ko instagram kaa wo vlog dikhaaya gaya jo junk food ko pramot kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, the second group was shown the Instagram blog in which Healthy Food was promoted
 bataa den, tisare group ko khaane ke alaava koi duusari tasviren dikhaai gai
 The result of the study is shocking
 jin bacchon ko instagram par junk food kii tasviir dikhaai unhone 32 pratishat calories junk food ke rup main lee or puure din main unki calories intech main 26 pratishat kii vruddhi hui
 At the same time, there is not much difference between the calorie intake of the children who were shown healthy eating pictures and the calorie intake of the first group
 study kaa hissaa raheen aina kots kahati hai ' hamaari study se ye saaf ho gaya he ki soshal media or duusare vlog ke chalate bacchon kaa rujhaan junk food kii taraf bad rahaa he
 On the other hand, the healthy things that are being advertised are not having any effect on the children
 'vaise aaj kal internet par koi bhi kuch bhi daal saktaa he
 Till now no body has been formed that keeps an eye on this thing
 isi mudde par chintaa jataate hue aina kots kahati hai 'aaj ke time main bachche film sitaron se kam or vlogaron se zyada prabhavit he
 Given this, there is a need for strict rules on digital platforms so that these vloggers cannot encourage children to eat junk food

 i am very happy with this
 ’ panesar ne virendra sahvaag or tendulkar ko 11 gend ke bheetar out karke baikfoot par laa diya tha lekin team antim satr main vaapasi karne main safal rahi
 Panesar has bowled Tendulkar for the third time
 isse pehle vah 2006 main nagpur or 2007 main lords main bhi is diggaj ballebaaj ko out kar chuke hai
 Panesar, who took four wickets for 91 runs in 34 overs on the first day, said that he has worked hard with England bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed to correct his action and he benefited from this at the Wankhede Stadium here
 panesar ne kaha, ‘abhyaas satr ke dauraan apane ection ko sahi rakhane ke liye mushtak bhai ke saath maine kadi mehnat kii
 Panesar is confident that his team will be able to contain India within 300 runs on Saturday morning, having scored 266 for six on the first day

 Panesar said, "I think we bowled well
" hamane shuruuaat main bhartiya ballebaajon par kaaphi dabaav banaaya
 The Indian team did not expect this
 unhone toss jeeta or sochaa ki kuch wicket ganvaakar ve 300 ran bana lenge
 But as a team we put pressure on them and taking five wickets in the beginning is a proof of how much pressure we had created
 ’ a man sitting in India wanted to hide his enemy
 par dikkat ye thi ki dushman hindustan se hajaaron mile dur kisi or mulk main tha
 And he could not go there or did not want to go
 ab bina jaae us anjaan mulk main apane dushman ko wo kaise thikaane lagaae? lihaaja kaaphi sochane ke baad usne ek tarkeeb nikaali
 One such trick was that he got a murderer for rent and without getting it he gave him a betel nut
 ye duniya kaa sabase anokhaa katl tha jisaki supaari naa to badmaashon ke saath kisi gumnaam thikaane par chori chhipe meeting kar di gai or naa hi badmaashon ko maranevaali kii tasviir haathon-haath thamai gai
 Rather, here all the work from finding betel nuts to giving betel nuts was done through internet
 pehle computer par supaari kilors kii talash shuru hui or phir baat banate hi karodon rupye ke badale dushman kii tasviir chupake se internet ke raste hi kaatilon tak sarka di gai
 And before anyone could have heard of this, a man away from the eyes of the world had been riddled with bullets
 insaan kii jindagi ko computer yaa smartphone ke ek clic main samet denevaali internet kii duniya kaa ab yahi nayaa cheharaa he
 This is the dark world of deep net
 internet kii is duniya main jurm kaa kaarobaar hota he
 Here are the market of betel nuts
 yahaan khatarnaak drugs kii online bikri bhi hoti he
 In the world of crime, everything is sold in this world, known as Deep Net
 phir chaahe wo kaayade-kanoonon kii najar main kitna hi bada gunaah kyon naa ho
 In other words, Deep Net means that world of internet, where after reaching, you can not only hire supari killers sitting at home, but can also buy weapons easily, sell drugs and if you wish, then any Terrorists can also donate to the organization
 is saal dilli kii ek hai profile lekin choti si drug party main bhi isi deep net ke jariye drug kii khep mangai gai
 But before the party reached its zenith, the drug made a young man so upset that he got out of his room and entangled people with something that was put to death
 subooton kii kami se beshak police is maamle main deep net kaa zikr naa karti ho, lekin dhakad sibar exparts kii maane to ye deep net se nikali maut kaa koi pehla or iklauta maamla nahin tha
 Cocaine, LSD, Betel Killer, Fraud Methods, Fake Currency, Hacking Software, Child Pornography and all the things in the black world of crime are being sold through 'deep Net' which you cannot think of
 hitman natwork yani contrect killer, supaari killer kaa giroh jo puri duniya kisi bhi jagah kisi bhi insaan ko paise ke liye khatme kaa vaada karte he lekin contract killer muhaiyaa karaane vaali is bevesite kii kuch sharte bhi hai
 The condition is that this gang does not take bets to harm children below 16 years and top 10 leaders of the country
 onest cocain store: yun to ye nasha par puri duniya main pabandi he lekin jurm kii is duniya main online kaarobaar karne vaale apradhi jehar bhi internet par berok tok bech rahe hai
 Not only this, all the drugs like benzos, kennybiz, LSD are provided in this world of crime with guarantees and claims to be delivered to your designated place
 jurm kii ye ek aisi ajeeb duniya he, jiske tah tak pahunchnaa aaj bhi duniya kii smart police forcej ke liye ek tedi kheer he
 Because everything found on this internet of crime is everything
 lekin chori chhipe or kanoon kii nigahon se batch kar
 No one knows who is serving crime in the world of crime, and to whom he is giving his service, he does not even want to know, he only needs the price for his work
 hamaari soch jahaan jurm kii duniya ke bare main khatm ho jaati he vahaan se jurm kii ye kaali duniya shuru hoti he
 The world of crime where everything is found
 ghar baithe, 24 ghante, 7 din wo bhi kanoon tej nigahon se bilkul dur
 Experts who keep an eye on the black world believe that the deep net web is many times larger and more spread than the normal web and efforts to stop this business in the world have failed

 It is being told that many more people are still involved in this gang, whose police are talking about investigating
 aadhaar card banane ke liye aaropee kisi tarah kaa koi dacument bhi nahin lete the
 Recently, when this matter reached the legislator's ear, he imposed the duty of his younger brother Manoj Nagar in this matter
 ek yojana ke tahat vidhayak ke karyaalay par kaam karne vaale vyakti ko aadhaar card main adress badalane ke liye sector 12 adaalat parisar main bheja gaya
 According to Pushpendra Singh, who is leading the team, he was informed recently that Aadhaar cards are being made in the Sector 12 court premises through fake letter heads and stamps of the MLA
 unhone police ko isaki soochna di or police ke saath unhone maukey par jaakar chapa maaraa
 According to Pushpendra, he is a resident of Rajasthan and had reached Sector 12 on the pretext of changing the address of Faridabad instead of Rajasthan
 bina koi dacuments liye unhone is kaam ke liye 1200 maange
 In this way, the police caught the accused red handed

 To fulfill this dream of the Prime Minister, skill centers are being opened in the universities of the country

 The Central University of Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi has won the same case
 jamiya main 2 corcej physiotherapy department main chal rahe hai jabaki bie vokational in solar energy ke naam se ek course physics department or diploma in refrijreshan and air-condishning naam se ek course uniwarsity politechnic main chal rahaa he

 They are in great demand in the market

 Excellent labs have been designed for these two courses at a very low cost
 inkaa udghaatan mangalvaar ko vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog ke sachiv jasapaal sandhu ne kiya
 He was very happy that Jamia got the lab usually prepared in 20-25 lakhs in just 5 lakhs

 In this way he saved a lot of money from the general public
 " kaushal centre main chalane walevocational corceski khaasiyat ye he ki ye multiple entry or agsit program hai
 That is, if someone leaves the course in one year, then he will get diploma certificate, who leaves in 2 years, he will get advance diploma and he who studies in 3 years will get bachelor's degree
 isi tarah diploma kiye hue chaatr ko advance diploma yaa snaatak ke course main daakhila mil saktaa he
 According to Professor Talat Ahmad, vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, “the children coming to these skill centers come from extremely poor families

 " vahiin uttar pradesh ke syohara se jamiya padhane aae adnan choudhary ke liye is kaushal centre main padhanaa ek sapane ke sach hone jaisaa he

 Fueled by the need for Muslim votes, and the fear of distance from the upper castes, Nitish Kumar has been giving rise to a growing crisis in the BJP and JD (U) alliance, and the wind has been big for many years between Nitish Kumar's Chief Minister's office and voter box He is balanced with caution
 ve ek vyavahaarakushal netaa hai, jo raajnneeti kii do dhuriyon ko saath lekar chalane main kuch bhi galat nahin maanate
 It is no wonder that the Bihar Chief Minister was seen in a dargah a fortnight ago when his coalition partner BJP started its national executive meeting in Patna
 12 june ko nitish ne akhbaar main ek vigyaapan dekha jisamen unki us tasviir kaa prayog kiya gaya tha or unhen gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa haath pakade hue dikhaaya gaya tha
 What was it then, they then started their all-round attack and even canceled the dinner banquet for the senior BJP leader, a move that certainly bothered some people but it did not surprise anyone
 apane mehmaan ke liye darwaja band karnaa nitish jaise shishtacharcushal netaa se apekshit nahin tha par unki naaraazgi apratyaashit nahin thi
 There are many reasons this time for the political symbolism to erupt
 nitish ke raajnneetik shabdkosh main insaan ko is baat se pahachaanaa jaataa he ki vah kiske saath ko najar-andaaj karata he
 Nitish seems to have made it clear that Modi and Varun Gandhi have to be kept away from election campaigning in Bihar and they do not seem to be in a mood to make any sense on this
 jaahir taur par nitish kisi ko bhi apane gathbandhan kii railgadee main kud-phaand nahin karne denge
 In such a way, how can Modi, who has been kept away from Bihar since 2005, come out easily to all the claims of showing kindness to help Bihar? This was given by Gujarat for the Kosi flood relief work of Rs 5 crore
 ko lautaane ke vivaadaaspad faisle kii vyakhya kar detii he
 The opposition in Bihar also made a lot of hue and cry about this decision to return the money, and RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan also questioned Nitish's view of returning Gujarat money as Kosi flood victims
 Complete rehabilitation is yet to be done
 badalte ghatnakram se bhaajapa main kai log khush nahin hai
 BJP MLA Rameshwar Chaurasia questions, "narendra Modi is one of our honorable leaders
 aise main koi unhen bihar se dur rakhane ke bare main soch bhi kaise saktaa he or phir hamaara dost kaise rah saktaa he?'' bhaajapa ke pravaktaa sanjay mayukh ne bhi nitish kumaar ko gujarat ke paise lautaane ke faisle par punarvichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 It is clear that Nitish has not paid any heed to these criticisms
 beshak bhaajapa-jad (you) gathbandhan khatarnaak mode par nahin pahunchaa he lekin un donon ke bich aapasi vishwaas kam hota spasht najar aa rahaa he
 However, the Chief Minister seems very balanced in front of everyone
 gujarat kii aarthik sahaayta ko lautaae jane ko lekar jab mukhyamantri se sawaal poocha gaya to nitish ne somvaar ko kaha, ''shanti rakhen, tanaav lene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 As everything did not end here, a Deputy Superintendent of Police was sent to Surat city in Gujarat to investigate the controversial advertisement
 haalanki bhaajapa kii ore se tikhi pratikriya aane par us police adhikari ko vahaan se waapas bula liya gaya
 All this happened despite the JD (U) candidates taking BJP mlas votes in the recently concluded Rajya Sabha elections
 somvaar ko vishwaas yatra ke dauraan rajya ke up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi samet koi bhi bada netaa unke saath najar nahin aayaa
 Nitish's Vishwa Yatra is being seen as pre-election campaigning
 check waapas karne ke nitish ke faisle ke chalate modi ravivaar ko bhi mukhyamantri kii raily se nadaarad rahe the, jiske chalate patna shahar vidhansabha kshetra main nitish kii ek baithak ko radd karnaa padaa
 This seat is currently held by bjp's Nand Kishore Yadav
 lekin lagata he, nitish is bahishkaar se katai vichlit nahin hue hai
 They are clearly hiding their political cards and speculation about their next move is hot
 nitish ko dar he ki narendra modi kii maujuudagi rajya kii 16 fisadi muslim aabaadi ko khafa kar degi, jise jeetne ke liye ve bharsak prayaas kar rahe hai
 Like other 'secular' leaders, the Chief Minister of Bihar is not ready to accept the man who has been accused of the Gujarat riots
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ke taur par unhone apane saadhe chaar saal ke shashan main vishesh kalyaan nitiyon ke jariye muslimon ke bich apana ek vishesh sthaan banaaya he
 He opened the case of the Bhagalpur riots two decades later and took many other steps to woo the Muslim community, for the community that had played an important role in strengthening Lalu's roots in the last two decades
 raajnneetik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agar bhaajapa is mode par nitish se alag ho jaati he to narendra modi par unka rukh unki kalyankari yojanaon se bhi zyada phayda pahunchane vaala siddh hoga
 If you go to the pages of the past and look at the footsteps of Nitish, then it gives quite contradictory signs
 pichley saal ludhiana main rajg kii raily ke dauraan nitish ne modi se haath milaayaa tha
 He seems to have forgotten the fact that his cabinet colleagues consider himself a member of the RSS and he is also said to have done a car service in Ayodhya
 nitish 1995 main bhaajapa kii vaarshik baithak main bhi shaamil hue the
 Since coming to power, Nitish has grown older than his party
 unke paas aisa vishwaas karne ke kaaran bhi the-iske liye rajya bhaajapa netaaon ke sajade kaa abhaari hona chahie-tabhi to ve bhaajapa se bhi bade ho gaye
 BJP leaders, including members of Nitish's cabinet, kept their eyes closed at a time when Nitish was busy building a new mass base at the expense of the BJP
 ye bhaajapa netaa rajya main gathbandhan dharm or raajnneetik auchity kii aad main gaun bhoomika nibhaate rahe jabaki vastutah unka dhyaan apni cabinet kii kursi main hi rama rahaa
 Many believe that Nitish's current move is thoughtful enough to provoke the BJP to take steps like withdrawing support, which will help prove him a victim before the elections
 november 2005 se rajg ko bihar main nitish dwaara chalaae jane vaale gathbandhan ke taur par janaa jaataa rahaa he
 Just then, Nitish changed the rules of governance and politics
 yahi nahin, unhone ise bihar main ise ek aadmi kaa khel banaakar rakh diya
 a section of BJP leaders today believes that the party should not have given so much space to the JD (U) leader but it happened because the central leadership — which has lost many allies in the past — wanted the Bihar Chief Minister with him at all costs 
 bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv main kai logon ke liye, nitish ek paimaana the jisase ve nai dilli main apni sambhaavnaaon ko aank sakate the
 Even in the present times, the central leaders of the BJP are seen to be under extreme restraint to pull the alliance
 isse bhi adhik yah ki loksabhaa main haar or jharkhand main haalia rajnatik shikast ke chalate bhaajapa or adhik nuksaan uthaane ke liye taiyaar najar nahin aati
 On the other hand, such slavery gave Nitish Kumar a chance to ride on the BJP while at the same time he carried out the task of keeping the central BJP away from Bihar
 2004 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dilli main hui haar ke baad bhaajapa surakshatmak rukh apana chuki thi
 Due to this, the party's emphasis in Bihar also seems to have decreased
 nitish ne ek sayaane netaa ke taur par apane sahyogi kii kamajori kaa bharpoor phayda uthaaya or uski kamajori se apane liye ek majboot aadhaar taiyaar kar daalaa
 In the last four years, he has tried to create a unique combination by reaching out to backward castes, Muslims and Dalits
 iske alaava, bhaajapa ke saath rahane ne unki savarna voton ko rijhaane main bhi madad kii
 This equation was also well received by him because his base was divided in these communities due to the separate fighting of opposition-congress and RJD-LJP
 bhaajapa se alag hone par unke savarna vot khone kaa khatra maujuud he
 Yes, this goal may be to balance competitive interests
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri modi kii sampradayik chhavi ke alaava bhi kuch aisa he jo nitish ke liye unhen puri tarah se duuri banaae rakhane vaala bana detaa he? sambhawatah ye unki mahatvakankshaayen hi hai jo unki raahen katati hai
 In the coming years, these two Chief Ministers may possibly be the two major non-congress competitors at the national level
 patna main yojit bhaajapa kii swabhimaan raily ke dauraan, modi ne daawa kiya ki unhone gujarat ke gaanvon main choubison ghante bijli sunishchit karai he
 It is seen as an attempt to prove himself as a new development man in the courtyard of Nitish - a thing which Nitish Kumar cannot digest at all
 ab nitish kaa lakshya satta ko apane kabje main rakhana he
 If he wins the election then it is not impossible that he will be seen in the lead role in the 2014 war in Delhi
 is baat se katai inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki lagaataar teen baar gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad narendra modi kii nigahen bhi sambhawatah sheersh pad par lagi ho sakati hai
 BJP working towards agenda-2014 will not be happy to keep Bihar out of reach of Modi
 rashtriya kaaryakarini se pehle, bhaajapa nitish kii simaaon ko aankane or modi ko rashtriya str ke netaa ke taur par pesh karne ke formule kaa pareekshan kar rahi he
 This has the opposite effect, but the BJP knows very well that the Chief Minister of Gujarat is one of the few mascots who can take them closer to the South Block
 iske alaava, aisa lagata he ki bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv kaa apane sahyogi nitish par adig vishwaas nahin rahaa he
 The circumstances are quite clear: Modi cannot be kept away from Bihar and if Nitish fails to get what he wants, he will want to step alone
 agar bhaajapa or jad (you) alag hone kii raah chunate hai to aage kya hoga? loksabhaa chunaav 2009 ke turant baad 18 vidhansabha siton ke liye hue up-chunaavon main rajg kii haar nitish kii chunaavon main pradarshan karne main madad karne kii kshamta par prashnchinh lagaati he
 For the JD (U) leader, this fight will prove to be a bit difficult as only a few people of his party oppose his political style
 lekin tab, agar sahanubhuti kii lahar unke saath hoti he, nitish kii sahmati congress ke saath banane kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Now BJP and JD (U) leaders are in talks to establish an alliance

 These days the Maharashtra government is advertising loudly - for the anti-spit Act
 yani thook pabandi kanoon
 The government wants to end the habit of spitting in public places
 isliye is baar kanoon lekar aa rahi he
 By the way, every municipality has a law, which has a system of imposing spits and filth as a penalty, but these laws of local bodies are very poor
 isliye arase se is kanoon kii jarurat mahasoos ho rahi thi
 The spit ban law in Mumbai is also important because tuberculosis (TB) is widespread in the city
 khule main thukne se ye or failati he
 The comments sarkaar ne fasebuk or duusare manchon se janata se apil kii he ki ve apane suzav sarkaar ko den, taaki thukne waalon ko kaise sajaa di jaae or ise amal main kaise laayaa jaae is par maanak tay kiye ja saken
 So far, the government has made up its mind that for the first time, if caught spitting, it will have to pay a fine of Rs 1000 and compulsory social service of 1 day
 is saamaajik seva main saarvajanik jagahon kii gandagi ko saaf karnaa bhi shaamil he
 If caught spitting for the second time, then a fine of Rs 3000 and 3 days community service and a third time fine of Rs 5000 and five days community service will be done
 thukne waalon ke khilaaf yah muhim tab zyada rang dikhaaegi jab kanoon paarit ho jayega, lekin bada sawaal yah he ki ise lagu kaise kiya jayega
 Which agency will be the one to catch these spiters and impose a fine? sarkaar ne fasebuk or duusare manchon se janata se apil kii he ki ve apane suzav sarkaar ko den, taaki thukne waalon ko kaise sajaa di jaae or ise amal main kaise laayaa jaae is par maanak tay kiye ja saken

 The BSP supremomayawati has said that she will not beg any party for seats in the upcoming elections
 unhone mangalvaar ko kaha ki ve dalit, alpsankhyak or savarna samaaj ke garibon ke sammaan se samjhauta nahin karne vaali hai
 At the same time, he told that the BSP is entitled to get 'respectable seats' for the electoral alliance and will continue to contest on its own instead of 'begging' anyone for seats
 congress par bhi saadhaa nishanamayawati ne saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik or shaikshanik str par dalit samaaj kii dayaneey sthiti ke liye bijepi or congress donon hi dalon ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that if these two parties were friendly to the poor of Bahujan society and Savarna society, then in the last 70 years there would have been a lot of improvement and there would have been proper participation of these classes in power
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne bijepi or congress ko baraabar kaa doshi tehraate hue kaha ki congress or bhaajapa, donon hi partiyaan bispi, iske netritv ko kamjor or badnaam karne ke liye hameshaa prayasarat rahati hai
 Especially at the time of elections, these malicious efforts become even more intense and toxic
 ’ unhone party kaaryakartaaon ko isse saavdhaan rahane ke liye aagaah bhi kiya
 What is the meaning of Mayawati's statement? It is clear from Mayawati's statement that she is as angry with the Congress as she is angry with the ruling BJP
 congress or bispi main gathbandhan kii ummid tuutane ke baad aarope-pratyope kaa daur bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 However, this situation can certainly be pleasant for the BJP, because the vote that is being pushed by the anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh will not only go to the account of the Congress but also in the court of parties like BSP
 isse bijepi ke khilaaf kisi ek dal ke majboot hone kii koshish kamjor hogi
 Shock the efforts of Congress? Even though the Congress is dreaming of uniting opposition parties against the ruling BJP at the Center, all those dreams are seen shattering on the ground
 madhya pradesh main bispi or sapamahagathbandhanakar congress ke saath aane se pehle hi inkaar kar chukin hai, ab mana ja rahaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi rahul gandhi kii party ko mayawati kaa saath to nahin milegaa
 The Congress has failed to convince the opposition parties
 nateeja ye hua ki pehle mayawati ne chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii party ke saath gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya or phir siton kaa pench fansaakar madhya pradesh main bhi congress se kinaaraa kar liya
 Following the footsteps of Mayawati, Akhilesh's patience dam was also broken and while waiting for the decision of the Congress, the SP also got out of the alliance in Madhya Pradesh
 bijepi ko mil saktaa he phaaydaloksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue mayawati ke sanket congress ke liye or bhi badi mushkil khadi kar sakati hai
 Why the BSP may not have a single Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh at present, but in the coming days, the alliance of SP and BSP can isolate the Congress
 mayawati ke is faisle se sabase zyada phaayde main bijepi dikh rahi he
 Actually, the atmosphere that was being created about the grand alliance with the decision of Maya will not be made
 iskaa sidhaa asar bijepi ke virodh main khadey matadaataaon par padegaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections for BJP, these are good signs that BSP, Congress and SP are not ready at the moment to form an alliance

 com On the issue of the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the US has given a big blow to Pakistan
 america ne saaf kiya he ki kashmir par unki niti main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Pakistan was hoping that the US would support it on Kashmir issue
 khaskar pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke haalia america daure ke dauraan america raashtrapati donald trump ke kashmir mudde par madhyasthata vaale bayaan ke baad
 On the other hand, after the withdrawal of the special state status given to Jammu and Kashmir by the Government of India, the United States also appealed to both countries to maintain 'peace and restraint' in view of the increasing tension between India and Pakistan
 is
 guuruuvaar ko ek press conference ke dauraan media ke sawaalon ke jawaab main america videsh vibhaag kii pravaktaa morgan orteigus ne saaf kiya ki kashmir ko lekar trump prashasan kii niti main koi parivartan nahin hua he
 Ortegus said, "even if it were, i certainly would not have announced it here, but no, it is not
 "unhone aage kaha, "jaahir taur par yah ek aisi baat he, jis par ham sabhi baraabar najar banaae hue hai
 We appeal to all parties to maintain 'peace and moderation'
 ham kashmir va sabhi anya muddon par bharat or pakistan ke bich sidhe samvaad kaa samarthan karte hai
 "when a journalist asked a State Department spokesperson to react to a statement by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, in which Imran said 'india can commit genocide in Kashmir'
 is par morgan orteigus ne sadhi hui pratikriya dete hue kaha ki america sabhi se aagrah karata he ki kanoon kaa raaj banaae rakhen, maanav adhikaron or antarrashtriya maanakon kaa paalan karen
 Pakistan also demanded the United Nations to intervene in India's move on Kashmir
 lekin sanyukt raashtra ne bhi kashmir mudde par hastkshep karne se inkaar karte hue pakistan ko shimla samjhaute kii yaad dilaai he or ise ek dwipaksheeya mudda bataaya he
 Ever since India removed Article 370, Pakistan has been furious and is gimmicking in front of the world
 pakistan ko lag rahaa he ki antarrashtriya samudaay ke saamne kashmir mudde par ronaa rone se wo bharat par dabaav bana legaa
 But so far no country has openly supported Pakistan, while many countries have described India's move on Kashmir as its internal matter
 madhya pradesh main balaatkaar kii shikaar nau saal kii ek bacchee ko gambhir haalat main nagpur ke ek aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 This is the same hospital where a four-year-old rape victim died after being in a coma for a week in Seoni, Madhya Pradesh at the end of last month
 adhikariyon ke mutabik jis bacchee ko aaj nagpur ke care hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya he, uske saath kareeb ek haftaa pehle balaatkaar kiya gaya tha
 According to the doctors treating this girl in Madhya Pradesh, since the baby's wounds are serious, it has been brought to Nagpur for better treatment
 adhikariyon ke mutabik jis bacchee ko aaj nagpur ke care hospital main bhartee karaayaa gaya he, uske saath kareeb ek haftaa pehle balaatkaar kiya gaya tha
 According to the doctors treating this girl in Madhya Pradesh, since the baby's wounds are serious, it has been brought to Nagpur for better treatment
 bhartiya dak seva kii naukari chhodkar nagaur jile ke medta shahar ke ashok choudhary ne apane kasbe main kapade kaa dhandha shuru kiya tha
 One day he needed a car to go somewhere
 sabhi pahchaan waalon ko phone kiya, koi gaadi hi khaali nahin mili
 Why? She had gone to an event of death row in some village with people from all the nearby villages
 kaarykram radd karke baithe choudhary ke dimag main mrityubhoj ghumta rahaa
 After expressing a little curiosity, it came to know that the family members of the deceased have to spend a lot in the death row
 ve amir hon yaa garib
 If there was a shoplifting slowdown in may-june, Chaudhary also got time to study on this evil behavior
 ve is nattejey par pahunche ki ise rokane ke liye koi pahal karne se darataa he
 There was fear among the people that if the deceased elders did not pay their obeisance, then in the village, something might arise on them tomorrow
 gaanv main 10-20 logon ke bich rakhi jane vaali raay yaa sandesh zyada prabhavi hota he
 Thinking this, in July 2005, he started a campaign named Abhinav Rajasthan
 yuvaaon ko saath lekar roj 4-5 gaanvon kaa daura shuru kiya
 With the help of the youth of the village, with the help of the youth, the villagers gathered and held meetings in the village's Guvad (public place), argued that why not spend millions of money on death row for the education of children and saving for their future to be done
 yuvaaon ko sir hilaate dekh bujurg bhi sochane par majaboor hue
 In Lunias village with a population of two hundred and fifty houses, the mood of the obituary changed
 yah puri tarah se band to nahin hua lekin fark vyapak padaa
 Earlier people from many villages used to live
 sankhya hajaar ke kareeb pahunch jaati
 Now the figure does not reach even hundred
 pattal kaa dayera bhi simata
 Sweets and all other dishes were made
 sabji-puri tak maamla aayaa
 The expenditure also came down to a few thousand rupees from lakhs
 lunias ke hi sukharaam bataate hai, ''gaanv main sabha ke baad yahaan mrityubhoj kaa kharch das fisadi bhi nahin rahaa
 Now on such occasions, the people of the village do not go to Jimene
 30 saal kii umr main haal hi dam todane vaale gaanv ke dhiruram ke ilaaj par parijanon or rishtedaaron ko kaaphi kharch karnaa padaa tha
 If the death row had not stopped, it would have been a matter of selling land for the family members, which has been common here
 kai gaanvon main choudhary kaa abhiyaan khaasaa asarkaarak rahaa
 In fifty-five villages like Dangawas, Inana, Rayadhanu, the death row was completely closed
 nagaur hi nahin, paali or jodhpur jilon ke saikadon gaanvon main logon kaa najariya badal chukaa he
 In the villages of Pipar area of pali, all the dishes have started disappearing from the plate of Mrityabhoja
 gauratlab he ki pashchimi rajasthan main mrityubhoj or duusare maukon par opium saarvajanik taur par parosi jaati he
 The expenses incurred in such events on one side and the expenses of death row on one side
 par choudhary ke abhiyaan ke baad opium kii manuhaar puri tarah se uth gai
 Pratap Singh, who was in a government job, says, "opium was used for a full 10-12 days at the death row, which is now closed
" '' na pehle kii tarah jamaavada lagata he, na hi manuhaar hoti he
 Expenditure on Chaudhary's campaign! Nominal
 5-7 logon ke gaanv-gaanv jane ke liye vaahan kaa kharch ve log milakar uthaa lete hai
 Just
 mrityubhoj ko band karne ke daawey karne vaali sarkarein or unke tantra bhale na kaamyaab hui hon par choudhary ne to ek misaal kaayam hi kar di
 It is understood that the government is contemplating a change in the Nuclear Liability Bill and deliberately removing an important provision for binding foreign nuclear supplier for compensation in case of accidents caused by any action taken or negligence
 Offer is included
 ye parivartan bhopal jahrili gas cond faisle main halki sajaa sunaae jane kii prishthbhumi main kiye ja rahe hai
 The decision has been strongly criticized by opposition BJP and Left parties
 unka kahana he ki yah america dabaav main kiya ja rahaa he
 It is believed that the Department of Atomic Energy had sent the Government's intention in the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology on Tuesday
 aisa lagata he ki khud videsh mantralay bhi in parivartanon se achakachaa gaya
 The Ministry of External Affairs itself plays a major role in foreign cooperation with the US and other countries for the government
 videsh mantralay ke ucch padasth sutron ne bataaya ki dhara 17 (kha) kam se kam pichley hafte tak vidheyak kaa ek hissaa thi or unhen iskaa ilm nahin he ki parmaanu urja vibhaag kii ore se kisi parivartan kaa koi vichaar he
 However, sources said that the government cannot withdraw the accountability of the supplier under contractual obligation and the interests of the common man will be protected
 unka daawa he ki yah sunishchit kiya jaayegaa ki bhopal jahrili gas cond ke faisle ke sandarbh main audyogic haadase se nibatane or peediton ko paryaapt muaavja dene main bhartiya kanoonon kii jo kamajori ujagar hui he use dur kiya jaye or peediton ko paryaapt muaavja mili
 There has been no official statement from the government on these changes, other than a press release from the Department of Atomic Energy referring to the reports of removal and amendment of the bill
 yah bas itnaa kahati he ki parmaanu kshati ke liye naagarik daayitv vidheyak 2010 ek sansadeey samiti ke vichaaradhin he jo iske ‘tamaam pahaluon kaa pareekshan kar rahi he
 "the role of the government is limited and will be limited to providing information on the questions presented by the committee," the release said
 ’ loksabhaa main parmaanu daayitv vidheyak saat may ko pesh kiya gaya tha
 The important change that the government is considering in the Bill relates to Section 17
 isamen parmaanu sanyantr ke sanchaalak ko ‘upachaar kaa adhikaar’ he, jo sarkari bhartiya parmaanu urja nigam limited (enpisiiel) he

 jidipi ke is number ko pesh karne ke liye sankhyikee sachiv ne press conference hi nahin kii
 This is a bizarre example of failed culture in school colleges
 fail karne vaala yaa to ghar nahin jaataa he yaa ghar jaataa he to babuji ke dar se pichley darvaaze se jaataa he
 This visualization suggests that this psychology has probably reached the government as well
 jidipi ke number kharaab aae to sankhyikee sachiv ne press conference hi nahin kii
 While the same secretary was present in the press conference when the GDP rate was 5 percent in the month of June
 lekin is baar jidipi 5 pratishat se kam hui to sachiv sahab ne press conference nahin kii
 While there is a press conference every quarter
 ek tarah se parampara si bani hui thi lekin is baar yah parampara tut gai he
 Press releases have been released on Twitter and the website
 aap is vakt vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman or vaanijya mantri piyush goyal ke twit hi dekhie ki wo kya bataa rahe hai
 However, during the formation of Modi Sarkar II itself, it was said that there would be an investment of 100 lakh crores on infrastructure
 agle chaar saal main
 But the record of the first six months suggests that the start is not good
 aktubar maheene main aath kor industry ke aankade bataa rahe hai ki ek bhi positive news nahin he
 Growth rates in six of the eight core industries have fallen
 agar sabko milakar dekhie to 5
 There is a drop of 8 percent
 neshnal stastical aphis ke aankadon ke anusaar rojgaar dene vaale sector manuphaccharing main vikaas dar negative ho gai he
 Manufacturing has recorded a growth rate of -1, below zero
 khanan sector main vikaas dar 1 pratishat he
 Growth rate in electricity, gas, water and other facilities3
 6 pratishat he
 Growth rate in construction sector 3
 3 pratishat hi rahaa he
 The growth rate in agriculture, forest produce, fisheries is 2 percent
 ye wo sector hai jinamein vikaas dar 4
 Below 3 percent average
 manuphaccharing main vikaas dar zero ke neeche ho gai he
 This 6 in the same quarter last year
 9 pratishat thi
 Now think about what level of destruction has happened in this sector that 6 within a year
 9 pratishat se ghat kar zero ke neeche vikaas dar aa gai he
 Are the factories closed? It also shows that the growth rate of electricity and gas sector is also 3
 6 pratishat hi he
 The effect of this is also seen that in the Coimbatore Municipality of Tamil Nadu, 549 Safai Karmacharis vacancy came, then 7000 engineers, diploma holders and graduates applied
 isi saal farvari main tamilnadu vidhansabha main safaikarmi ke 14 post nikle the to 4600 ejeeniyar or emb ne applai kiya tha
 Tamil Nadu is considered a stronghold of the manufacturing sector
 isamen se kai ummidavaar aise the jo privet sector main kaam karte the magar vahaan selary bahut kam thi
 So he came for a job of 15,000
 iskaa matlab he ki arthvyavastha or rojgaar kaa sankat bhale media main na dikhaai de, sadakon par kahin zyaada gambhir he
 Growth in agriculture, forest produce and fisheries in 2018-19 9 pratishat thi
 In 2019, the growth rate in this sector has reduced by half
 2
 1 percent
 agar manuphaccharing sector main vikaas dar kareeb 7 pratishat se ghat kar shunya ke neeche chalaa jaae or kheti machhlee paalan ke sector main 4
 2 to 9 percent
 1 ho jaae ab aap inhen do aankadon se hindustan ke shahar or gaanvon main faili berojgaare ko samaj lijie
 The thing to know at this time is how many factories have been closed across the country in the last one year
 kyonki bijli ke upbhog main bhi kami ai he
 The media no longer covers this unemployment as before, so you are not very sensitive to these figures but the messages reaching us every day are telling that the job has started breaking the morale of the youth
 6 timahi se agar patan hi patan he to phir iskaa asar kitna hoga
 Where are the far-reaching consequences of demonetisation? It has been three years but neither the result is known nor the far-reaching
 sitambar main jiesti kaa sangrah 19 maheene main sabase kam rahaa tha

 sansad ke isi satr main vitt rajya mantri anuraag thakur ne bayaan diya he ki personal incum tex or karporation tex aktubar main 17 pratishat gir gaya
 Decreased from 61,000 crores to 50,000 crores as compared to last year
 jab jidipi kii dar 5 pratishat hui thi tab karporate tex main baari kami kii gai thi
 He had no effect on this quarter
 shaayad iskaa bhi doorgaami parinaam aayega
 You see how far the GDP has come down from the last six quarters
 vitt varsh 18 kii chauthi timahi main jidipi 8
 1 percent which was reduced to 4 in this quarter
 5 pratishat ho gai he
 If the growth rate of the manufacturing sector goes below zero, it will obviously affect the exports
 aktubar main niryaat main 1 pratishat kii kami ai he
 Petroleum and leather industries have cooled down
 sitambar main niryaat main to or bhi baari kami ai thi
 India's economy has moved to the ICU
 arthvyavastha ke saath-saath bharat kii mardavyavastha bahut kharaab ho chuki he
 Is rotten sakht kanoon or faansee kii maang ko lekar na jane kitne pradarshan hue magar bahut kuch aisa zarur he jo iske bas kii baat nahin he
 Either the male society of India has rotted from within
 uske maanas or manovigyaan kaa jin chizon se nirmaan ho rahaa he, use ham samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 The time has come to be serious about this question
 balaatkaar maamalon main kanoonee sakhti ke alaava in pahaluon par dhyaan dena hi hoga
 Be it late or early punishment, both are not having a significant impact on rape cases
 supreme court main balaatkaar ko lekar bahes chal rahi he
 Seeing the reports of rape in the media, the bench of the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justice Anirudh Bose, Justice Deepak Gupta took suo motu cognizance
 court ne rajyon ke hoicourt main darj balaatkaar ke maamalon ke aankade manga liye
 From 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, 24, 212 rape cases were registered
 ye cese sirf naaballig bacchon or bacchiyon se sambandhit the
 Looking at this record, the police had filed charge sheets in 12,231 cases and were investigating in 11,981 cases
 yani kuch system bana he
 Trial was going on in 6,449 cases
 911 cese kaa faisla aayaa tha
 This percentage is sad according to the verdict
 maatr 4 pratishat he
 This is also because under Poxo's law, there is a time limit for the charge sheet from the investigation
 iske bhi balaatkaar kii ghatnaon par koi khaas asar nahin padaa he
 Only 24,212 cases of rape and sexual violence of minor children have been reported
 vishwa guru bharat main har din balaatkaar ke 132 maamle darj hote hai
 In 2017, there were 17,780 cases reported in the whole year, in 2019, 24,212 cases were registered in just 6 months
 supreme court ne is maamle main ek aadesh diya tha ki jin zilon main 100 se zyaada cese hai vahaan par special court set ap kiye jaaenge
 The court had sought a report from the central government within 30 days for information on the implementation of this order
 court ne aadesh diya tha ki har zile main forencik lab banaae jaaen
 According to the system, this is the condition of investigation and justice in rape cases
 samaaj ke lihaaz se dekhie to ruh kaanp jaati he
 The reports of rape from Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand, and Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, are telling that in our society, irrespective of any caste and religious society, the number of male and sick people has increased considerably
 balaatkaar maamle main reporting ke liye supreme court ke disha nirdesh ke anusaar ham pahchaan sambandhit jaankaree to nahin de sakate lekin is aadesh kaa amal bhi bemaani ho chukaa he kyonki soshal media main hyderabad kii mahila kaa naam or tasviir sab chal hi rahaa he
 When the 27-year-old woman was abducted, the police petrol van was located just a short distance away
 mahila ne khatre ko bhaanp kar apni bahan ko phone kiya tha
 The police of Cyberabad say that it would not have been possible if they had called 100 numbers
 us mahila kaa ab kuch bhi saakshaat nahin he
 He has been burned after violence and alleged rape

 a few minutes later another man came and walked away with the bike

 The woman called her sister and said keep talking
 lekin tab tak use agava kar liya gaya
 And now he is murdered
 jala diya ja chukaa he
 70 percent of his body was burnt when his body was found
 police bhale kuch kahe, lekin raat main safar karne vaali mahilaon kii suraksha vyavastha kii haalat kaa pataa chalata he
 Police has formed ten teams
 soshal media main jis tarah puure maamle ko sampradayik rup diya ja rahaa he
 He is out of sight and scope of the court and police
 puri mashinari lag gai he ise ghar ghar pahunchane kii
 i wish this machinery would also be active in the case of 24000 incidents of rape of children
 zaahir he apradhi kisi bhi mazahab yaa jati kaa ho saktaa he balki hota hi he lekin is paimaane par dekhnaa balaatkaar ke maamalon ke saath or ninsaphi he
 Perhaps the machinery or IT cell knows that justice is rarely available in these cases, so they should be used politically

 The government has changed in Madhya Pradesh but one thing that has not changed is the health system
 kahin aspataal main marijon ke haath main khaanaa paros diya ja rahaa he to kahin kute marizon ke bistar par aaraam farma rahe hai
 The Health Minister of Madhya Pradesh is visiting the hospital in the capital Bhopal to take stock of the disorder but the health services sickness is very serious, spread in every district
 sagar ke bundelkhand medical college aspataal main sevaayen itani behatar kii marizon ke saath, kutton ko bhi aaraam farmaane kaa mauka miltaa he
 Freedom is so much that stray dogs slaughter their patients in the plate
 khayr tanj ek taraf, kuch logon ne bataaya ki aspataal main hi pichley saal 6 logon ko kutton ne kaat khaaya
 These situations are when the previous government from Sagar had two strong cabinet ministers, also in this government
 swasthya mantri tulsi silavat ko jab hamane is bare main bataaya to unhone kaha, 'ye gambhir maamla he, meri choti bahan abhi bhartee he, unase baat karke is samasya kaa samaadhaan ati sheeghra karenge
 'at the same time, Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava, who belongs to Sagar, said,' When governments change, the new ministers who come in this way turn around, they try to show
 abhi wo samaj nahin paaenge logon kii samasya, swaagat satkar karaayenge, bangale putvaayenge agle saal tak rahe to kaam shuru karenge
 'guna' is the area of jyotiraditya Scindia, a strong leader of the Congress
 yahaan ke sarkari aspataal main marizon ko thali kii jagah haath main khaanaa parosa ja rahaa he
 Patients and their officials complain that the demands of utensils are limited
 esees survey ke mutabik madhyapradesh ke sarkari aspataalon main maut ke aankade lagbhag 38 fisad hai, pradesh ke 51 jilon ke 250 aspataalon main doctoron kii kami he
 The sanctioned posts of first class experts are 3266, 2044 are vacant
 chikitsa adhikariyon ke sweekrut pad-4860, 1926 khaali hai
 Anesthetist 70 percent posts are vacant
 gayanacologist ke 54 fisadi pad khaali hai, jabaki shishu rog visheshgyon ke 40 fisadi pad khaali hai
 By the way, the old minister is now the Leader of Opposition, he is currently tightening the stool, forgetting that his government also has a report card of 15 years, the government is also engaged in all populist promises, but no serious discussion on health has started
 Whereas the health index of Madhya Pradesh has fallen continuously in the last 5 years

 agast main sakal mudrasphiti 9
 78 percent, which was 9 in July
 22 pratishat thi

 maudrik niti sakht kiye jane se haal ke dinon main aarthik vruddhi prabhavit hui he
 It is noteworthy that the growth rate of industrial production in July decreased to a 21-month low
 3 pratishat par aa gai
 On the other hand, the GDP growth rate in the april-june quarter declined to an 18-month low of 7

 This is the condition of Chief Minister Kejriwal's party in Delhi
 party ko fouran daftar khaali karne kaa notice thamaya ja chukaa he
 At Deendayal Upadhyay Marg near ITO, 206, Rouse Avenue, the common man came under the target of the Shunglu Committee, the party's office
 cameti kii report main aavanton ko galat paaya gaya or alji ne aavanton radd kar diya
 Therefore, the PWD issued a strict notice that the office of the Aam Aadmi Party should be vacated immediately
 shungalu samiti kii report menam aadmi partiko daphtar aavantit karne par sawaal uthaae gaye the
 The report said that the land was not the jurisdiction of the Delhi government, so it could not formulate a policy for giving offices or land to any political party
 sutron ke mutabik alji ne lokanirmaan vibhaag se is par raay maangi thi
 The PWD gave its opinion that keeping the rules in mind, the Aam Aadmi Party was given space for office
 dilli sarkaar ke lok nirmaan vibhaag (PWD) ke afasaron ne aam aadmi party ko notice jari kar aadesh diya he ki vah itio ke paas sthit rouse avenue ke apane daftar ko turant khaali kare or lok nirmaan vibhaag ko saunpe
 The notice states that this allocation was done against the rule, so it has been canceled
 gauratlab he ki rajanivas kii ore se jari aadesh main lokanirmaan mantri satyendra jain dwaara rouse avenue sthit bangala number 206 or 217 ke bare main praapt record ke aadhaar paravanton ko raddakarne kii karrwai kii gai thi
 It said that the allocation of 206 number bungalow as party office was allowed by Satyendra Jain
 jabaki manjuuri se judi is file main lok nirmaan vibhaag ne saaf taur par kaha, ki awasaiya bangale ko kisi party karyaalay ke liye aavantit karne kaa koi kanoonee praavdhaan nahin he, bhale hi mantrimandal ne aavanton kaa faisla kiya ho
 Now the Aam Aadmi Party has a war of party office even before MCD
 aaj-kal main hi daftar khaali karne kaa notice thamaya ja chukaa he
 It remains to be seen whether Kejriwal vacates the party office or starts a new war

 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi is going to hold mass meetings before the Lok Sabha elections
 ve desh ke kone-kone main reliyaan or sabhaayen karenge
 It is said that his team has planned to address at least 25 crore people
 iske liye 250 jan sabhaaon ko sambodhit karne kii yojana he
 a senior BJP leader said that the effort is to hold at least 250 general meetings so that the party can be strongly contested
 inke madhyam se desh kii ek chauthai aabaadi tak unki aawaaj pahunche
 But this time the party wants to conduct Narendra Modi's meetings even in areas where BJP has less reach, such as states like Bengal, Kerala, Orissa
 in rajyon main agar party apni pakad bana leti he to use loksabhaa chunaav main achche number aa jaaenge
 Narendra Modi did more than 100 rallies in the last election and got good response
 party isse utsahit he
 Given that the Congress is on the back foot, the party wants to project Modi well
 uski yah bhi yojana he ki narendra modi ko jati kii raajnneeti se dur rakhaa jaae taaki un par koi thappa nahin lage
 The party is excited by the meetings of Narendra Modi

 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that my employment statement was distorted by the media
 main aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko aarakshan dene kaa samarthak hum, lekin aarakshan naukari kii guarantee nahin he
 Because the job is a different issue
 desh main jab tak companiyaan nahin hongi tab tak logon ko naukariyaan kaise milegi
 Therefore, the government is working on setting up new industries in the country
 unhone bataaya ki ham innovations ke jariye nai naukariyaan paidaa karenge
 For this, we are working on projects for ethanol, water transportation, jatropha oil
 ithenul aane vaale samay main petrol kaa paryaay hoga
 We are working on industries to make it happen
 iske alaava siplan, nadiyon ke jariye water transportesan jaise logisticks par kaam kar rahe hai
 If these projects start then people will get employment
 gadakari ne bataaya naukari or rojgaar main kya he antar
 
 
 The Union Minister said that my employment statement is misinterpreted
 sahi baat to yah he ki naukari or rojgaar main antar he
 If we work in a company, then that job is done and employment can also be done by ourselves
 isliye main yuvaaon se yah lagaataar apil bhi kar rahaa hum ki entrprenyor bane or logon ko naukariyaan den
 We want the youth to set up industries with new ideas
 hamaare paas kai udyog lagane ke raste hai
 Industries will grow through innovation
 
 
 nitin gadakari ne kaha ki job creat karne ke liye innovations chahie
 Jobs will have to be increased after the government gives reservation
 yah keval public sector se nahin hoga
 The private sector will also have to move forward
 export badhanaa hoga
 People will get new jobs only when production increases

 piem modi ke philistin daure se pehle bharat main philistin ke rajdoot ne yah ummid jataai he ki philistin ke saath khadey rahane ke apane purv rukh par bharat drudh rahegaa
 He said that PM Modi can become peace envoy between Palestine and Israel
 gauratlab he ki america dwaara jerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ghoshit karne ke baad ab philistin ko bharat se hi ummid he ki piem modi philistin kii madad karenge
 Palestinian Ambassador to India Adnan Abu Alhaiza told Aaj tak-india Today that the US has partnered with its stand
 isiilie philistin ke log chaahate hai ki 'sanyukt raashtra ke saath koi nai sanstha' isroyal or philistin ke bich madhyasthata kare
 It would be appropriate for India and other countries to find a real solution to the Palestine movement
 unhone kaha ki philistin main shanti laane main bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Alhaiza said, 'PM Modi has good relations with both countries and i think he can play a very good role in this matter

 He said that India has tried to strike a balance between fragile relations with Israel and the Palestinians
 donon deshon ke saath samaan rishta rakhane kii bharat kii niti ko philistin main sakaaratmak tareeke se hi dekha jaataa he, kyonki ham koi isroyal ke 'puchalla' nahin hai ki koi rashtradhyaksh isroyal kaa mukhya daura kare or phir philistin main sirf shishtachar mulaakaat ke liye aa jaae
 The Palestinian envoy said, "when PM Modi visited Israel, i met the top officials of the Indian Foreign Ministry
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki philistin ko bharat ek swatantra desh kii tarah hi samajhataa he or use isroyal kaa 'puchalla' nahin samajhataa ki jab bhi koi isroyal ke daure par jaataa he to vah philistin bhi jaae
 i had the privilege of meeting the Prime Minister and i invited him
 ab vahjordan ke badayahan aa rahe hai, iskaa matlab he ki vah philistin se ek swatantra desh kii tarah bartaav kar rahe hai
