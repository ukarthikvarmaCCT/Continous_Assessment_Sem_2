 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has taken the contract to destroy the ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb of the country
 swami ke nae bayaan se assam main har kone se virodh ke awaajen uth khadi hui hai
 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy recently said in Guwahati that the mosque is not a religious place and it can be demolished at any time
 swami ke is bayaan kaa rajya main jabardast virodh hua he or unke khilaaf maamla bhi darj karavaaya gaya he
 Swamy cited an example of Saudi Arabia in favor of his statement, where mosques were built to build roads
 unhone kaha, 'masjid koi dharmik sthal nahin hota, yah mahaj ek building hoti he
 It can be dropped at any time
 agar koi meri raay se asahmat he to main is mudde par uske saath bahes karne ko taiyaar hum
 i got this information from the people of Saudi Arabia
 ' swami ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki sabhi bhartiya musalmaan pehle hindu the
 Opposing this statement, several organizations in the state burnt effigies of the BJP leader
 assam vakf board, ol assam minurity students union or anya muslim sanghathanon ne swami ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he, vahiin krishak mukti sangram samiti naam kii ek sanstha ne swami ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 120(bi) (aapraadhik shadyantra rachane) or 153(e) (dharm ke aadhaar par samudaayon ke bich dushmani paidaa karnaa) ke tahat exiaar bhi darj karvaa di
 The president of the organization Akhil Gogoi said, 'before the assembly elections, the BJP wants to incite communal sentiment in the state
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf swami kaa vivaadaaspad bayaan isi shadyantra kaa hissaa he
 We criticize it and demand from the Assam government that the entry of Swami into the state be banned
 'duusari ore, mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ne bhi subramanyam swami or bijepi kii aalochana karte hue kaha, 'bijepi ko asamvaasiyon kii bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunchane kii keemat chukaani hogi
 'here, the bjp's state unit has shied away from Swamy's statement by sensing public anger against the statement
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh siddharth bhattacharya ne kaha, 'ye swami ke vyaktigat bayaan hai, naa ki hamaari party ke, lekin, is mudde par ham apane kendriya netritv ko likhenge

 Hyderabad has been affected by the horrific bomb blasts on Thursday evening
 charminar khamosh he
 Although the smoke has been removed from Dilsukh Nagar, the blood splatter inside the police barricade is not completely dry yet
 achaanak ek bam fata or kuch hi pal pehle logon kii awajahi, kharidari karti auraton, daudte-bhaagate bacchon, chamchamati dukaanon or raushaniyon se gulzaar dilsukh nagar kaali lapaton main dhu-dhu kar jalane laga
 What humans, what shops, everything turned into garbage heaps
 ab haadasa guzar chukaa he, lekin apane peeche chhod gaya he dher saare sawaal
 After all, who is behind these blasts? 17 people have died in this terrorist attack, while 124 people have been injured
 hamale se pehle aatankiyon ne shahar ke bare main kaaphi jaankariyaan jutai thim
 For example, where the blasts took place, it is the busiest area in Hyderabad, where the crowd is busy all day
 pehla dhamaakaa venkatadri theatre ke paas hua or kuch hi minuton baad doosraa dhamaakaa dilasukhanagar cross road ke paas hua, jahaan konark theatre he or yahaan kaaphi bheedbhad rahati he
 Dilsukhnagar is the center of vocational and educational institutions
 bam dhamaake us vakt hue, jab chaatro sahit badi sankhya main log apane ghar ja rahe the or theatre sahit khaane-pine kii dukaanon par logon kii bheed jamaa thi
 There was chaos and panic on the first blast
 log kuch samaj pate, iske baad hi doosraa dhamaakaa ho gaya
 It took a while to clear the smoke
 tab kahin jaakar logon ne dekha ki mar chuke or maranasann sthiti main log yahaan-vahaan pade hue hai
 It did not take long for the police to find that both the bombs were ieds and were fitted in a bicycle
 in bamon main timer laga tha or donon ke fatne ke samay main bas kuch hi minuton kaa antaraal tha
 According to the picture that has emerged from the investigation of investigative agencies so far, according to the Indian Mujahideen (IM) is suspected to be behind this bloody attack
 sutron ke mutabik lashkar ke front orgenigeshan indian mujahidin ne is dhamaake ke liye simi se jude sthaneey logon kii madad lee thi
 According to sources, this Holi of blood was not played suddenly
 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki andhra pradesh police ko yah pehle se pataa tha ki shahar main aatanki hamale hone kii ashanka he or iske liye aatankiyon ne kam-se-kam teen maah pehle yahaan reki bhi kii thi
 Im caught militant Syed Maqbool alias Juber revealed in October last year that Dilsukhnagar, Begum Bazar and Abdis of Hyderabad were the targets of terrorists
 sawaal yah he ki makabool ke khulaase ke baad aakhir police sachet kyon nahin hui? aise kisi bhi hamale ke maddenjar suraksha ke paryaapt intjaam kyon nahin kiye gaye, jabaki yah khulaasa khud iem ke ek pramukh aatanki ne kiya tha
 Maqbool, an accused in the Pune serial blast, also told Mumbai police investigators that he had trained his colleagues to make improvised explosive devices used in terror attacks
 jaanch agenciyon ke shaq kii sui ke iem kii ore mudiye kii do khaas vajahen hai
 The first is to make bombs and the second to be planted ab tak kii jaanch se yah tay he ki bam main ammonium nitrate, fual oil or timer kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 At the same time, both bombs were planted in tiffin boxes kept in bicycles
 iem iske pehle bhi 2008 main dilli or jayupar main hue bam dhamaakon main cycle kaa istemaal kar chukaa he
 He also claimed responsibility for both these blasts
 jaanch agenciyon kaa maananaa he ki iem ke aakaa riyaj bhatkal ne june, 2012 main aatankwaadi imran or akram ke saath ek or shaks ko hyderabad ke dilsukh nagar ilaake kii reki karne ke liye bheja tha
 Imran is the same person who carried out the best bakery bomb blast in Pune
 is bich suraksha agenciyaan maharashtra ke ahamed nagar or nanded main apni team bhejkar iem ke puraane samparkon ko khangaalane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 Hopefully some important clues can be found from there
 suraag talashne main juty suraksha agenciyon kaa shaq iem ko lekar tab or bhi gaharaaya, jab dhamaake se teen din pehle iem ke ek bhagode sadsy asadullah abraar ke mumbai main hone kaa pataa chalaa
 10 lakhs on it
 kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya gaya he
 With the needle of suspicion on IM, the finger of questions also turns towards the government and the police that despite knowing that many areas of Hyderabad including Dilsukhnagar are under the target of terrorists, why did the police try to increase surveillance of these places Didn't it? Ever since the hanging of Ajmal Kasab and Afzal Guru, there were constant threats of revenge from Pakistani terrorist organizations
 iem sahit inamen se kai sanghathanon ke kattar samarthak bharat main bhi maujuud hai
 Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde also said after the explosion that a warning of terrorist attacks was issued in all the states including Andhra Pradesh
 chunki unke gathbandhan sahyogi or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri unke paas hi maujuud the, isliye scindia ko yah kahana padaa ki yah chetavanee sthaan yaa samay vishesh ke liye nahin thi
 According to Andhra Pradesh DGP Dinesh Reddy, "the National Investigative Agency had merely suggested to all the states including Andhra Pradesh that such an incident could happen
" ’’hyderabad sarkaar ne is bich aatankiyon se muqabla karne ke liye octopus naam ke vishesh bal kaa gathan kiya he
 For this, it has also been approved to recruit 30,000 policemen
 khufia vibhaag main police counter intelegence ikai ko bhi majboot kiya gaya he, lekin inamen koi bhi guuruuvaar ko dilasukhanagar kii sadakon par masuumon kaa khun bahane se nahin roak paaya
 The entire atmosphere of Hyderabad has become like a volcano that bursts at any time
 ab jaanch agenciyaan jaanch main juty hai or sarkaar bayanon main
 In Parliament, the government and the opposition are making bitter statements against each other
 sab kah rahe hai, aatankiyon ko bakhsha nahin jayega

 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki kejariwal ko shame aani chahie jo unhone desh ke sainikon kaa apmaan kiya or sargical strike par sawaal uthaae
 These days Kejriwal is wearing a Pakistani cap and sees everything through political spectacles
 gupta ke mutabik har baat main kejariwal raajnneetik phayda talashte hai isliye wo shaheedon kii chitaaon par raajnneeti karan se bhi baaj nahin aa rahe hai
 The Leader of the Opposition alleged that if Kejriwal makes an excuse for the hiccups from the Central Government, his intention behind this is to hide his failures, because he is failing to fulfill his responsibility, he does not know how to run the government and hence should politicize the allegations
 vijendra gupta ke mutabik arvind kejariwal abhi tak vipaksh ke netaa kii tarah hi vyavhaar kar rahe hai, jabaki unako pataa hona chahie ki dilli kii janata se unhen chunaa he or unhen mukhyamatri kii tarah vyavhaar or kaam karnaa chahie
 Gupta said that by talking big things no one becomes big, but big things have to be done to become big, but Kejriwal is engaged in doing politics only and only

 punjab chunaav ke liye kejariwal ne puri takat laga di he or dilli ke paise kaa istemaal isamen kar rahe hai
 Whether it is a case of Delhi money being advertised in other states or a waste of tax money to enhance its image, Kejriwal is only using Delhi's power to serve his political interests

 Our batsmen, bowlers, fielders all performed well
 test ke pehle din hamane lunch ke samay yah faisla kiya tha ki hamen vipakshi team ke ran rokane honge
 If we did that and were able to take a few wickets, then we can return to the game as Smith and Warner were the only runs in the Australian team

 The credit for this win goes to all the players
 hamaare ballebaajon, gendbaajon, fielderon sabane acha pradarshan kiya
 On the first day of the test, we had decided at lunch that we would have to stop the runs of the opposition team
 yadi hamane aisa kiya or ekaadh wicket lene main safal ho gaye to ham khel main vaapasi kar sakate hai kyonki australian team main smith or warner hi ran bana rahe the
 Kuldeep bowled amazing in that session
 ham jaanate the ki kuldeep net main shandaar bowling kar rahaa he or hamaare liye anoothaa gendbaaj he
 We all believed in his ability
 australian team kii prashansa kii jaani chahie

 tippaniyan Man and the best player of the series, Ravindra Jadeja said, It is good to be a number one Test bowler

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the new building of the Central Information Commission in the capital Delhi
 is dauraan unhone maujuuda vakt main soochna hai-ve ke paanch stambh bataae
 He said that there are five pillars of today's modern information high-way, which are Asking (ask), Listen (interact), Act (karma), and Inform (informing)
 unhone kaha ki ham is par ek saath kaam kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, PM Modi said that the Central Information Commission was formed about 12 years ago
 tab se lekar ayog kaa kaam kiraye kii imaaraton main chal rahaa tha
 The PM said, 'after the formation of the NDA government in 2014, all the processes were expedited and Rs 60 crore was sanctioned for this building
 'piem ne ye bhi bataaya ki dilli main doctor ambedkar international centre ko banane kaa faisla 1992 main hua tha
 But nothing happened for 23 years
 jiske baad hamaari sarkaar menshilanyas hua or locarpanbhi hua
 During this time he also said that when there is transparency in the systems, there is increased responsibility towards the people, there is a sense of responsibility, then both the way governments work and the effect of schemes change
 2 november ko shahrukh khan kaa janmdin he or duniya bhar main faile unke chaahane vaale is maukey par chup kahaan baithne vaale hai
 It is difficult for anyone from news channels to newspapers, websites and radio to ignore this popular star's birthday
 shahrukh ke ghar ke baahar phans kaa jamaavada laganaa or khan kaa unhen haath hilaakar shukriya adaa karnaa bhi koi nai baat nahin he
 Amidst all this, it is possible that the news related to this superstar fell in the ears of Punjab Singh, who is driving a taxi on the streets of Shimla, along with the rest
 wo baaten jise sunakar punjab singh us ateet main kho jaae jiskaa ek ahm hissaa kabhi shahrukh khan hua karte the
 Rajneesh and Lekh Tandon of Punjab were looking for a new face for their new serial 'dil Dariya' and they met Shah Rukh Khan here too
 punjab ko yaad he shahrukh kaa ‘ji janaab farmaaen’ kahana or nirdeshak lekh tandon kaa khan se baatcheet karke unhen agle din audishan ke liye bulaanaa jiske baad shuru hua dilli ke is aam ladke kaa ek khaas safar
 However, Punjab is also proud of the success of its 'shah Rukh ji' and is also glad that he is a part of this superstar's journey somewhere
 punjab singh main shaayad aapako 'billus' film kaa wo nayak dikhaai de jisaki ek superstar ko jaanane kii kahaniyaan kisi ke liye shimla se kalka ji tak ke safar kaa time paas he to kisi ke liye mahaz ek kissa
 Punjab Singh has explained his mind on one side that Shahrukh must have forgotten him but in some corner of his mind he is also expected to meet Shahrukh again
 tippaniyan You may also meet Punjab Singh while on vacation in Shimla and you will know the things of your favorite hero, which may not even be left in Shahrukh Khan's mind
 har taraf shahrukh hai kabhi tivi par dikhte hai to kabhi akhabaaron ke pannon par or kabhi chaay kii dukaan par chalane vaali charchaaon main unka zikr ho jaataa he
 Shah Rukh gets angry on seeing his fate and sometimes gets encouragement after seeing his success
 shahrukh jaise punjab singh ke jivan kaa sthaayee bhav ban gaye hai
 (based on a conversation with Punjab Singh) ho saktaa he kabhi shimla main chhuttiyaan bitaane ke dauraan aapaki mulaakaat bhi punjab singh se ho jaae or apane chahete hero kii wo baaten aapako maaloom chalem jo shaayad ab shahrukh khan ke zahan main bhi nahin bachi hon
 Shahrukh is everywhere, sometimes he appears on TV, sometimes on the pages of newspapers and sometimes in the discussions going on at the tea shop
 shahrukh jinhen dekhakar kabhi punjab ko apni kismat par gussa aata he to kabhi unki kamyaabi dekhakar haunsala miltaa he
 Punjab like Shah Rukh has become a permanent expression of Singh's life
 (punjab singh se baatcheet par aadhaarit) (based on a conversation with Punjab Singh) somvaar ko guwahati ke barsapaara stadium main toss ke liye utarate hi smriti mandhana ne badi uplabdhi hasil kar lee

 baba nigamanand kii somvaar ko maut ho gai lekin jis lakshya ko lekar wo lard rahe the use safal hote nahin dekh paae
 On May 26, the Nainital High Court ruled that the stone crush in the area close to the Ganges violated the Supreme Court's instructions but Nigamananda could not see it
 is samay tak wo coma main ja chuke the
 Here, on the issue of Nigmanand's death, BJP says that they were agitating against the High Court order
 bijepi pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki sarkaar ne ganga ko bachaane ke liye jo kadam uthaae the hai court ne unhen khatm kar diya tha
 He was admitted to the best hospital by the state government
 lekin congress bijepi kii kisi bhi daleel ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 According to Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi, no one else is aware of Nigmanand's fast, but the Uttarakhand government knew about this, then why the timely action was not taken
 idhar kendriya paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne nigamanand ko rajya or centre sarkaar ke liye tamaacha bataaya he
 Ramesh said that the state government did not show responsibility
 unka kahana tha ki unhone is mudde par rajya sarkaar ko chitthee likhi thi or uttarakhand sarkaar ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya or baad main baba nigamanand kii maut ho gai
 After the disclosure of the espionage racket, Shoaib, a resident of Jodhpur, who is believed to be the most important link in this case, has come under the grip of Delhi Police and intelligence agencies
 dilli police kii kai team sargarmi se shoeb kii talash main juty thi
 After which Shoaib, coming from Delhi to Jodhpur, was arrested by the police from Merta Road railway station
 jatiya baas nivasee shoeb jodhpur main logon ke passport banavaane ke saath hihani trapmen istemaal ke liye ladakiyon kii bhi talash karata tha
 Actually Shoaib used to look for girls who wanted to go to Pakistan but for some reason they could not get a visa for Pakistan
 passport-vija ke kaam ke dauraan hi shoeb pakistani duutavas ke adhikari mahmud akhtar ke sampark main aayaa tha
 Maulana Ramadan of Nagaur, who was caught in this case, was first caught by Shoaib in his web
 moulana ne paison ke laalach main hi subhash jangid ko bhi apane saath jod liya tha
 Actually Shoaib will be able to know how many people he has introduced to Mahmud Akhtar till now
 bataate chalem ki shoeb do din pehle mahmud akhtar se milane ke liye dilli gaya tha
 Due to not meeting Mahmud, he was returning from Delhi to Jodhpur this morning
 isi dauraan dilli police or khufia agency ke adhikariyon ne use giraftaar kar liya
 Significantly, Shoaib came to Delhi on the 25th of Ramadan and Subhash
 shoeb chidyaghar naa jaakar dilli ke shanti kunj hotel main hi ruk gaya tha
 When Shoaib came to know about the arrest of his companions, Shoaib ran away from the hotel
 giraftaar ke dauraan police ko shoeb ke paas se ek tablet or kuch mahatvapurn dastavej mili hai
 Also, the police has also got a visitor card for entry in Pakistan High Commission from him
 police ke mutabik, shoeb rajasthan or gujarat border par tainaat sena or biguef se judi ahm jaankariyaan ramajaan or subhash ko detaa tha
 After which this information was transmitted to Mahmud Akhtar
 shoeb kii giraftaar par dilli ke joint seepi rabindra yadav ne kaha ki shuruuaati jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki shoeb ke kuch rishtedaar pakistan main bhi rahete hai
 Shoaib has visited Pakistan 6 times so far
 giraftaar ke dauraan shoeb ke paas se ek tablet or kuch mahatvapoorndastavej baramadahue hai
 During the arrest, Shoaib also tried to break the tablet
 philhal tablet main maujuud jaankaree ko ricover karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 According to Joint CP Ravindra Yadav, Shoaib can make many shocking revelations in police interrogations
 dilli main aam aadmi party ne prachaar main puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 Arvind Kejriwal, the convenor of the party and former Chief Minister of Delhi where he is holding public meetings in the evening every day, along with lunch and dinner programs to raise funds
 lekin akele arvind kejariwal kahaan tak prachaar kar paaenge
 Therefore, other party leaders are also holding public meetings
 arvind kejariwal ke alaava purv shikshaamantri manish sisodiya, saansad bhagwant maan, dilli sanyojak ashutosh varisht netaa sanjay singh or yogendra bhi jansabha karne main lage hue
 Apart from Arvind Kejriwal, the largest crowd in the party is currently gathering to listen to Bhagwant Mann
 dakshini dilli ke devli vidhansabha main bhagwant maan ne kaha ki ye muqabla arvind kejariwal banaam narendra modi nahin he kyonki modi piem hai or siem banane ke liye wo dilli aane se rahe, lekin ye muqabla arvind kejariwal banaam pataa nahin koun he? kyonki bijepi ke siem ummidavaar kaa pataa hi nahin wo to ek bin captain kii team he
 Manish Sisodia, the second largest leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, who himself is contesting from East Delhi's Patparganj seat, also addressed a public meeting in the Janakpuri Assembly, stating that BJP has neither the face nor the vision for the chief minister
 abhi tak ke prachaar se aam aadmi party santusht dikh rahi he or usko lagata he ki wo is samay vot share main bijepi ke aasapaas aa gai he
 Let us tell you that in the Lok Sabha elections, BJP had got more than 46 percent votes while Aam Aadmi Party got around 33 percent
 abhi tak ground par ghoomane se jo meraa aam aadmi party ke bare main akalan he wo yah he ki nimna or nimna madhyam varg main aam aadmi party bahut majboot he jabaki madhyam or ucch madhyam varg main bahut kamazor
 Although the Aam Aadmi Party has got some success in this segment in the last few days, but still a large part of this segment is showing towards the BJP
 yuva voter main aam aadmi party ne bharosa jagaane kii koshish kii he kuch kamyaabi ke baavjood bada dissa bijepi kii taraf jhukaa hua he
 The Aam Aadmi Party appears to be in a strong position among Sikh and Muslim voters
 ascharyajanak taur par dehaat ke ilaakon me aam aadmi party majbooti se aage badhati dikh rahi he, yahaan aapako bataa den ki dehaat main hi pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main aam aadmi party bahut buree tarah se haar gai thi
 But it is important to note here that this is the position of the last of December in my personal assessment
 abhi maahaul bahut badal saktaa he, chunaavon kaa elaan hone ke baad, ummidavaaron ke elaan ke baad
 And the biggest thing is that the real atmosphere will be known when PM Narendra Modi himself will field for the BJP to rally
 ye bhi dekhnaa hoga ki congress kitna chadh paaegi in chunaavon main
 Because the vote bank of AAP and Congress is considered to be the same, it is believed that the more the Congress gets, the more BJP will go and the loss can be caused to the Aam Aadmi Party
 aisi surat main isliye aap ke netaa apni sabhaaon main kah bhi rahe hai ki muqabla keval bijepi or aap main he, congress ko vot dekar vot bekaar mat karnaa

 unka kahana he ki chunki is khandaan kii ladaai se upi ke bure din aane vaale hai, isliye yahaan fouran chunaav kara kar nai sarkaar banane kaa mauka diya jaae
 However, the people of the Yadav family continued to be in damage control today
 dushman ko ladata dekh lagata he ki mayawati kii baachhen khil ai hai
 She has issued a statement on this, in which she says, the battle of Yadav clan has come on the road
 akhbaar kuch is tarah kii hedline laga rahe hai, jaise
 
 
 SP supremo said that most of the ministers are counting the notes, Mulayam's support for Shivpal's rebellion, socialist families engaged in managing the family
 
 
 vagairah vagairah
 It seems that the bad days of UP are coming
 lihaaja fouran chunaav kara diya jaay
 '' udhar yadav khandaan ab damege control main laga he
 During the cabinet briefing, the media asked Akhilesh Yadav questions on family quarrels and the main anarchy, but in response Akhilesh Yadav gave information about distributing school bags and laptops
 yah baatcheet kuch yun hui
 Media: Is the Samajwadi Party ready to merge with Mukher Ansari's party Qaumi Ekta Dal? akhilesh : dekhie aapako ham pehle hi bataa chuke hai ki kaksha ek se lekar aath vaale bacchon ko skool bag ham muft denge
 The cabinet decided media : netaji kai baar khule manch se kah chuke hai ki mantri note kama rahe hai
 What will you say? akhilesh : (hansate hue) acha he
 
 
 Let me take the paper
 ab ham ja rahe hai

 We are all one
 lekin ye sara vivaad paidaa hua he ghar waalon ke sadak par ladane se
 If the family will fight in the house, then no one may bother
 lekin agar ghar vaale chauraahey par ladenge to kuch log majaa lenge, kuch log ladaai lagaayenge or kuch us ladaai main apana phayda talaashenge
 And if this house is a big political house, then there will be politics all over the country
 lihaaja mauka-masalehaath dekh kar laden
 Seeing the enemy fighting, Mayawati's calves have blossomed
 unhone is par baqayada ek bayaan jari kiya he, jisamen wo kahati hai, yadav kunbe kii ladaai sadak par aa gai he
 Newspapers are putting some such headlines, viz
 
 
 sapa supremeo bole note gin rahe hai zyaadaatar mantri, shivpal kii baghawat ko mulaayam kaa samarthan, kunba sanbhaalane main juta samaajawaadee parivaar
 
 
 Et cetera et cetera

 Therefore, elections should be held immediately
 '' On the other hand, the Yadav family is now under damage control

 media : mukhtaar ansaari kii party kaumi ekta dal se vilay ke liye kya samaajawaadee party taiyaar he? Akhilesh: See, we have already told you that we will give free school bags to children in classes one to eight
 cabinet ne ye faisla kiya Media: Netaji has said many times from the open platform that ministers are earning notes

 Shivpal Yadav, who threatened the resignation, also said in Moradabad today that the things you are running, there is nothing in our family
 ham sab ek hai
 But all this controversy has arisen due to street fighting on the street

 After reaching the outpost late in the night, the meeting DGP OP Singh went out late on inspection to check the policemen on the streets of the capital
 sabase pehle dijipi puraane lakhanu ke patanala chaowkee pahunche
 Already the outpost incharge was sitting here
 dijipi ne unase suraksha kii jaankaree lee or aane vaale tyohaar par mustaid rahane kii naseehat di
 When DGP inspected the gruesome jam, DGP OP Singh left Patanala and reached the Shaheed Path
 yahaan par vah lambey jam main funs gaye
 About 45 minutes the state police chief was stuck in a jam
 dur-dur tak naa hi koi police vaala or naa hi koi trephic police najar aayaa
 After much effort, the DGP commandos removed the truck and got some relief from the jam
 jiske baad auchak nirikshan bich me chhodkar opi singh shahid path se utarkar indira gandhi pratishthan ke raste se apane awaas pahunche
 Police was already in Mustaidalkhanu from late night

 It is possible to infer that surprise inspection was just the name, with CO and SO also present at the intersections

 rajasthan royles ke captain rahul dravid ne champions lig tii-20 ke pehle semifinal main chennai superkings par 14 ran kii jeet kaa shrey apane gendbaajon visheshkar 42 saal ke leg spinner praveen tambe ko diya, jinamein ab bhi ‘seekhney kii lalak’ he
 Dravid said after the match, it is the experience of Tambe, which is of use to the team
 vah lambey samay se club cricket main gendbaaji kar rahaa he or usamen ab bhi seekhney kii lalak he
 He always talks to Brad Hodge and Shane Watson about the speed of the ball and the dominance of the batting
 unhone kaha, jab hamane use (tambe) chunaa tha to kai logon ne sawaal uthaae the, lekin uski maansik dridhta sahi sabit hui
 Royals batting first scored 159 for eight wickets but Dravid felt that his team should have scored around 180
 unhone kaha, hamane 15 se 20 ran kam banaae lekin hamaari gendbaaji or kshetrarakshan shandaar rahaa
 Dravid said, i always enjoyed playing in Jaipur
 shaayad yahaan yah meraa aakhri match he or mujhe yahaan darshakon se bharpoor pyaar or samarthan mila
 Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised his bowlers for stopping the Royals for 159 runs, but he was disappointed with his batsmen's performance
 dhoni ne kaha, main samajhataa hum ki gendbaajon ne shandaar bhoomika nibhaai, kyonki lag rahaa tha ki ve isse bada score banaaenge
 Our batsmen did not meet expectations
 iske alaava do ballebaajon ke ran out hone se pareshaani bad gai
 In the last moments, Ravichandran Ashwin scored 46 and Chris Maurice scored 26 not out, but he was able to reduce the margin of defeat
 dhoni ne in donon kii prashansa kii
 He said, Ashwin performed well and Maurice supported him well
 pehle kuch overon main ballebaajon ne acchhee ballebaaji kii lekin duusari team paristhitiyon se acchhee tarah waakif thi or main jaanata tha ki unke gendbaaj hamen mauka nahin denge
 He bowled with a good line and length
 tippaniyan Tambe took three wickets for ten runs in four overs and was adjudged Man of the Match
 is leg spinner ne kaha, mujhe khushi he ki jab team ko jarurat thi tab maine acha pradarshan kiya
 i am thankful to Rahul Bhai and my coach who expressed confidence in me
 maine keval basics par dhyaan diya
 Ajinkya Rahane, who scored a half-century in a third consecutive match, equaled Michael Klinger's record for South Australia, saying the Royals had the advantage of having a good understanding of the wicket
 rahane ne kaha, ham wicket kii acchhee samaj rakhte hai
 We wanted to dominate after taking the shine off the ball
 yah hamaare liye bahut mahatvapurn match tha
 i only want to focus on positive things, but when the wickets were falling, i wanted to stick to one end
 unhone kaha, meraa kaam sakaaratmak bane rahanaa or jitani der tak sambhav ho krij par tike rahanaa tha

 unhone kaha, meraa kaam sakaaratmak bane rahanaa or jitani der tak sambhav ho krij par tike rahanaa tha
 He said, when we selected him (tambe), many people raised questions, but his mental fortitude proved to be right
 royles ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue aath wicket par 159 ran banaae lekin dravid ko lagata he ki unki team ko 180 ke kareeb score bananaa chahie tha
 "we scored 15-20 runs short but our bowling and fielding was excellent," he said
 dravid ne kaha, mujhe jaipur main khelnaa hameshaa acha laga
 This is probably my last match here and i got a lot of love and support from the audience here
 chennai superkings ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne royles ko 159 ran par rokane ke liye apane gendbaajon kii tarif kii, lekin vah apane ballebaajon ke pradarshan se niraash dikhe
 Dhoni said, i think the bowlers played a great role, because it seemed that they would score bigger than this
 hamaare ballebaaj apekshaaon par khare nahin utre
 Apart from this, the problem was increased due to the run out of two batsmen
 aakhri kshanon main ravichandran aswin ne 46 or kris mauris ne naabad 26 ran banaae, lekin vah haar kaa antar hi kam kar paae
 Dhoni praised both of them
 unhone kaha, aswin ne acha pradarshan kiya or mauris ne unka badhiya saath diya
 The batsmen batted well in the first few overs but the other team was well aware of the conditions and i knew that their bowlers would not give us a chance
 unhone acchhee line or length se gendbaaji kii
 The comments tambe ne chaar over main das ran dekar teen wicket liye or unhen main of da match chunaa gaya
 The leg-spinner said, i am happy that the team did well when it was needed
 main rahul bhai or apane coach kaa abhaari hum jinhone mujh par vishwaas jataayaa
 i only paid attention to the basics
 lagaataar tisare match main ardhashatak jadkar south australia ke maaikel clinger ke record kii barabari karne vaale ajinkya rahane ne kaha ki royles ko wicket kii acchhee samaj rakhane kaa phayda mila
 Rahane said, we have a good understanding of the wicket
 ham gend kii chamak utaarne ke baad haaavee hona chaahate the
 This was a very important match for us

 The second reason is the absence of Virat Kohli and Pujara in Brisbane

 BSP chief Mayawati termed the Samajwadi Party's demand for special status for Uttar Pradesh as a "drama" and said on Monday that they (SP) are raising such an issue keeping in mind the upcoming general elections
 mayawati ne sawaal kiya, 'jab sapa pichley ek saal se adhik avadhi se uttar pradesh main satta main he to yah mudda abhi kyon uthaa rahi he ?'unhone sansad parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 've (sapa) ye mudda isliye uthaa rahe hai kyonki chunaav nikat hai or rajya main kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bigad rahi he
 They are pretending to hide their weaknesses
 'sapa sadasyon ne somvaar ko rajyasabha main uttar pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja or aarthik package kii maang uthaai
 They also raised slogans in support of their demand
 mayawati ne kaha ki bispi jab kabhi bhi satta main ai, usne uttar pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang tatkaal uthaai

 unhone kaha, 'haalanki hamane jab sansad main ye mudda uthaaya, na to sapa, na bijepi or na hi congress ne hamaara samarthan kiya
 Mayawati criticized both the SP and the BJP amid reports of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and BJP leaders meeting Mulayam Singh Yadav in Lucknow and urging them to find a way to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya and persuade the Muslim community
 unhone kaha ki donon partiyaan pehle bhi chunaav se purv najadik ain thim or is baar bhi ve aisa hi kar rahi hai taaki uttar pradesh main sampradayik tanaav bhadakaayaa ja sake or donon samudaayon ko vibhajit karne kii koshish kii ja sake
 Mayawati said, 'this is a drama
 main janata se apil karti hum ki vah bijepi or sapa se gumraah na hon
 Both the parties are in a weak position in the state, so they have formed an alliance before the elections

 Booked Ola Share from Noida to Vaishali on 45 minutes
 kuch der ke baad jab ola dravar ko kol kiya to usne bataaya ki wo kisi duusari sawari ko pick kar rahaa he
 After waiting a long time, on the call again, the driver said that he was picking someone else
 lambey samay baad cab driver kii kol ai or usne kaha ki wo lokation par aa rahaa he
 When they checked the cab details on the app, the car details were different from that
 massej main whitego cab kii jaankaree thi, jabaki unke paas i20 car ai
 Apart from this, the number plate of that car was not yellow
 koi bhi commercial whical, bas or taxi ke number plate kaa becoground blike hota he or usapar yalo text hote hai
 That is, it was not a cab but a personal car
 unhone kaha he ki us cab main teen ladke the or ek driver tha jo dekhne main driver kii tarah nahin lag rahaa tha
 When he asked the driver where the cab he had booked was where he was, his reply was that the cab had become an accident, instead a second cab was sent
 haalanki unhone cab cancil kar diya ola se isaki shikaayat kii
 After this, Ola has given an answer to suspend the driver and also said that he will investigate the matter
 is ghatana ke baad unhone duusari personal ola cab book kii or uske driver ne unhen bataaya ki koi cab accident ke baad yaa to cab cancil kar di jaati he yaa phir nai cab kii jaankaree massej kar di jaati he
 According to the driver, it is better if the share cab is not booked after 7 pm
 aisi chook ke parinaam gambhir ho sakate hai, kyonki amuman log itnaa dhyaan nahin dete
 In particular, it also raises big questions on women safety in delhi-ncr
 is ghatana ke baad do mahatvapurn sawaal khadey hote hai jinka jawaab hamane ola se maanga he
 First, if Ola becomes an shareholder's cab, in that case the cab is sent to the user without booking new cab information
 Second, can Ola's cab be run in delhi-ncr without a yellow number plate The supreme court main 23 farvari se pienbi bank main hue mahaghotaale kii jaanch vaali janhit yachika par sunwaayee hogi
 Referring to the seriousness of the case in front of the Chief Justice's bench, advocate Dr

 After the PNB scam, another public interest litigation has been filed in the Supreme Court regarding the case of Vikram Kothari, owner of Rotomac

 Dhanda's lawyer Drs
 je pi dhanda ne court se ye bhi yachana kii he ki supreme court centre sarkaar ko ye nirdesh bhi de ki neerav modi ke pratyrpan kii kootnithik koshishen tej kii jaaen
 Not only this, specific guidelines should be made for large corporate houses or businessmen for bank loans above ten crore rupees
 sakht karrwai kaa ho praavdhanyachika main ye bhi maang he ki jo log rin bhugtan main difalter hai
 Strict rules should be put in place to auction their property immediately and they should be implemented
 in niyamon par amal karne main kotahi baratane vaale bank adhikariyon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kaa praavdhaan ho
 Make a panel of economic experts: Dhanda has also appealed that a panel of economic experts be formed
 ye panelbainkon dwaara500 karod yaa isse zyada ke bed lone kaa adhyayan kar court ko jaankaree de
 It has also been said in the huge loss to the country's economy that big businessmen have got political protection
 yahi vajah he ki wo jaldi se pakad main nahin aate
 Many such scams have caused huge damage to the country's economy in the last few decades
 ghotaalon ke mukaable sajaa bhi bahut kam logon ko mili or jo doshiyon se gaban or ghotaale kii rakam kii recovery hui uskaa koi phayda nahin he
 So this should also be taken care of while making the guidelines
 isse pehle vakil manoharlal sharma ne bhi bank ghotaale ko lekar pil daayar kar rakhi he

 hind yugma prakaashan ek kahani-sangrah prakashit karne ja rahaa he, 'jaadu bhari ladki'
 Its author is Kishore Chaudhary
 yah kitaab 23 farvari, 2015 se sabhi online store par relies hone ja rahi he
 Presently the book's pre-booking is on
 isi kahani sangrah se ek kahani 'gulzaan, dekho parinde!' neeche di gai he
 
 
 Gulzan, look Parinde! --- Chara's voice came from the closed door of Kishore Chaudharyaveli
 barason se bandi hone se darwaazon ke kabze ye bhul gaye the ki unka kaam bandi hokar baithe rahanaa nahin varan khulanaa or band hona aasaan karnaa he
 a thin pane of light flashed before the door and then a kamasin face appeared
 do maasoom ankhen
 The left shoulder gently slanting and came outward without touching the doorway
 isi baahar aane ke dauraan aankhon ne pehle qareeb or phir dur tak kaa pheraa diya
 Wanted to play two in the afternoon
 upar ke kamare main lagi pendulum vaali ghadi niyamit antaraal se ghante bajaati thi
 When that moment came, a sudden ringing hour caught everyone's attention
 kuch maheenon baad ghadi, samay or us ghar main rahane vaale log ghul-mil gaye
 The watch joined the mind in such a way that if things were kept continuously in the pocket, then they would not feel there
 gulzaan ne qadamon ko phulon kaa paath padhaayaa
 Gave the cat flexibility to the body
 hausale ko chil ke pankhons par rakhaa
 There was a farm near his mansion
 tekri par ek tuuti hui akeli minar thi
 Gulzan reduced the distance by cutting the land between the mansion and the tower at Tekri
 zamin kaa vah lanbaa-sa tukdaa prem kii choti-si kataran main samaa gaya
 Do not open, o do not open
 sabaki dopaher kii neenden salaamat rakhana
 On the tekri, the wind spread its scarf far and wide
 hawa aahista chalati hui apane dupattey main kuch nayi salawatein bhar rahi thi
 When the wind forms a new crevice, an old crevice disappears
 hawa ke dupattey ke bheetar khadi hui gulzaan aankh muundakar hawa kii koi kinari pakadati
 Folded it
 hawa rukne lagati
 Gulzan's eyes rediscovered
 raste ko dur tak dekha
 There was a mild slope, it was lost in the field
 kuch pattharon ke bich se dikhti hui zamin hi rasta thi
 There was nothing there
 nazar girti to ludhakti hui kahin dhoosar saleti rang ke bich jaakar kho jaati
 As marbles were lost
 vahiin aas-paas hi pade hote magar rangon ke chalaave main khud ko aise chipa lete ki dikhaai nahin dete
 His eyes were moving in wait as fast as a fresh and short memory of childhood
 jisamen ret kisi jalapari kii shakl odhakar apni ek taang par naachati thi
 The shadow of sand dancing amidst the sunshine, lifting the surrounding light objects into the air, blowing heavy objects into the ears; Blow, not with the body, blow it out of mind
 aise saaye kabhi achaanak aate the, jaise koi ruh aasmaan se guzari ho
 Rooh has done a bath of sand kai baar kuch chote saaye, jaise nayi janmi hui nanhee ruhon kii athkheli
 Buried amidst such small circles, Gulzan's breath stopped
 cycle par savaar ladkaa neeche dhalaan main guzar rahaa hota
 Gulzan should become a spirit thinking while sitting on a wall of the ruins of the tower lying on the top
 chil ke pankh odhe or ladke kii cycle par chaaya kar de
 Weaving the shade with the shadow of his wings, walked along with the bicycle
 ladke ko sochate hue vah apane haathon ko dekhati
 The delicate brown hairs of his hands were standing
 jaise zamin se kachi konpalein foot rahi hon
 By the time she looked down again, the silly boy riding the bicycle would have lost
 gulzaan ke bhure royen phir se gulabi rang ke hokar uske haathon ke bheetar dubak jate
 What is the color of the scarf that Hawa made? That boy's name was Dibang
 vah dhalaan kaa puraa chakkar lagaakar upar kii ore aata
 Dibang would get tired
 usase chadhaai nahin chadhi jaati
 She would look at him lightly
 haan, vah aa rahaa he
 tired
 jhukaa hua
 Stopped and stared at him many times
 vah ek hi taraf se aata
 Where there was Gulzan on that side
 dhoop dibang main rang bharti
 Sweating
 hawa dhoop ke ugaae is nae rang par najuk anguli ghumaati
 Dry his sweat
 gulzaan saans roke baith jaati
 As the last watch came
 jeena mukammal hua
 Dibang is sitting near him
 uske maathe par kisi ne gulab jal chhidaka ho
 Many drops flashed on the frontal
 boonden, duusari boondon se milakar bhauhon ke paas se gaalon par ludhakti hui
 Gulzan would have become the smallest fish in the world
 vah turant kudakar ek nanhee buund main ghus jaati
 She drifted from there
 bhauhon ke shyaam rang ko chuumati, gaal par gudagudi karti
 Dibang finally wipes his sweat
 nanhee machhlee bani hui gulzaan uski hatheli main aa jaati
 He drops little with his fingers
 gulzaan ghaas par se uthati or nanhee machhlee se phir ladki ban jaati
 She starts laughing dibang dekhtaa
 Why is she laughing? vah phir hansati
 She liked that Dibang could not know what she was a while back
 ve dhoop or hawa ke hawaale rahete
 There is no shade under the drying processions
 gulzaan kahati- “aaj tum yaheen rahanaa mere paas, hilanaa nahin
 Today i will find out whether the boy riding the bicycle is you or someone else
 kya ghati main se hokar or bhi koi ladkaa idhar aata he?”dibang kahata- “or koi nahin aata
 And do you see anyone? "" Well, i don't see, but where do you get lost by coming down the slope with a big black stone gulch on the old paved bend? "" i am lost to come to you
 ”minar ke bhagnavshesh suune hote
 Parinde has been missing for several days
 un donon ne jane kitne dinon se parindon ko dekha hi nahin
 The air would be silent as soon as Dibang arrived
 gulzaan hawa ke rang padhanaa or kinari pakadakar tah karnaa bhul jaati
 The wind got angry with them and lurked in the courtyard of the broken tower
 hawa chup baithi hui, halki chaanv main zamin par likhti
 If one is found then the other two is lost
 saanvare kya main karuun inkaajo ye baaje main taar hajarnam ek tera yaad mujhakoguljaan ga rahi hoti
 Dibang would have been listening for the lost
 man ke kagaz par geele rangon se tasviir banane lagati
 The air would be enchanted by this song
 vah ruuthana chhodkar mandir ke baahar baithe hue dibang or gulzaan tak aati
 She would see that colors have taken shape on the boy's mind
 hawa un rangon ko aahista se pankhaa jhalti
 Dry the color quickly
 jaldi-jaldi ye ladkaa rangon se bhar jaae
 Spell the color in it
 rang isse chhalak-chhalak jaaen
 Color fly with me
 main chunar ban jaaon gulzaan kii
 Cover them both
 hawa ek gahari saans bharti
 Oh girls, whenever you like, how do you like it so much! The wind wants to break this stagnant scene
 vah ga rahi ladki kii qamar se kurte ko zaraa-sa udaati or ghaas banakar gudagudi karti
 There was a laugh in the groan of Gulzan's voice
 dibang muskura uthta
 He kept Gulzan's fingers in his palm
 bhuri chikani hatheli main kuch pankhudiyaan gulab kii
 Wet with shame
 laraz se bhari hui
 In this vibration, the song would split into a few pieces and get lost in the air
 hawa us gane ko bugchi main rakhkar sthir ho jaati
 a shadow came near the boy's shoulder
 us saaye kii gandh, hawa ke bina failane lagati
 The boy would take his eyes off ek gahari tapish gardan ke paas utarati
 In the calf of the feet, the quiver began to awake
 bhiige honton main dabe hue hont
 Yearning and yearning
 banhon kii kasamasaahat main beqaabu saans ke bich achaanak ve donon ek-duje ke chahare ko dekhte
 Eyes full of amazement
 ve donon ek-duje ke chehre ko thame hue phir se ankhen band kar lete
 In two fetish biaban
 toote mandir ke avasheshon kii chaanv tale
 Over the ledge
 haveli se dur
 Fire, water, soil, nothing
 ladki ghar aakar chat par tahalti
 No footsteps could be heard in the streets
 mohabbat, mohabbat, mohabbat
 An untouched new pakija smell
 kitabon se jhaankate hue aksharon se udati ateet kii syaahi se
 With a full of clothes
 tuuti diwaar ke paas pade bade pathar se
 Badan's touch, shudder, fear, and breathlessness
 khidki kaa pallaa chup baitha hua
 Innumerable windows of mind were filled with waiting
 dibang, dibang, o dibang
 Come, not from these windows; Come through the window of truth
 is palle ke jhule par savaar hokar aao
 Look, the mind is a sea
 baaripan badhata ja rahaa he
 This stay is a disaster
 is dabish main saans gaayab hui ja rahi he
 Break it Dibang
 har vaqt, dil betaab, dhadakanen beqaabu
 You are less har jagah kam ho
 Be short in every union
 tum ho hi nahin, itane kam ho
 There is no harm to the relaxed norms flying from the branches of peace
 dur aasmaan main ek hook faili hui
 Somewhere missing in some emptiness
 kahin nahin takaraati
 Empty skies and noiseless hooks
 raat guzar jaati
 After morning, the clock in the room above rang
 thik vahi ghanta jiskaa ladki ko intazaar hota
 The girl would walk towards the same hill
 tekri par pahunchne ke baad kuch hi der main dibang use aata hua dikhaai detaa
 Likely panting but smiling
 dibang uske paas aakar baithta
 Before Hawa's charisma started, Gulzan would ask- "what did you do last night?" He would reply- "I missed you
" tumne kya kiya
 "I did nothing, just fell asleep
" ” aisa kahkar gulzaan usase puuchhati- “ek baat sunoge
 ? "he says-" Yes, i will listen
 ”“magar use sunne ke baad tumko ek sawaal kaa jawaab dena hoga
 This answer will be necessary for me
 ”ladkaa hami bharta
 "if you do not answer, then you will commit sin
" ”“main jawaab doongaa
 "I will say this to someone only once in my life
" tumhen pakkaa jawaab dena hoga varna meri baat ko mere saath hi dafan hona padegaa
 Dibang would hold her hand lovingly
 do baar sir hilaakar hami bharta
 Gulzan would tell her
 dur puraani basti kaa ek ladkaa tha
 He used to run away from home every day
 ek din jab vah ghar pahunchaa dibang ke bade bhai ne poocha- “kyon re, kyon itnaa udhaas haal
 Speaking
 kahan lut gaya
 Where did it hurt? ”the boy said-“ i am sad because she writes tears on her pillow
 uske ansu be-awaz kyon behate hai?”ladke kaa galaa pakade hue uskaa bada bhai donon haathon se collar khinchataa he- “kahan jaataa he tu aajkal
 Did the potter's crematorium go? " The boy smiled
 uski hansee main kesaria rang ghulata jaataa
 The boy's collar used to be strangled as a noose
 bhai poochta- “bol kisi se vaada kiya he vahaan? koi awaz suni or haan bhari tuune?” collar kii gaanth se ghutan badi or ladke kii ankhen failane lageen
 There was a big gasp
 usne puraa jor lagaaya or ve donon alag hokar gir pade
 "she appeared a few days ago
 buudhe darakht vaale mode se upar tekri par dekho to sabko dikhti he
 When i saw him, he called up
 usne haath se ishaara kiya, udhar se aao
 There was an easy climb to the side as pointed
 main udhar gaya to hawa mujhe dhakel kar upar le gai
 The boy's brother ran quickly
 usne kamare kaa daravaaza band kiya
 Descending the stairs, reached the temple niche directly, sat on my knees
 uske haath kaanp rahe the
 Mother and Baba came running
 ladke kii bhabhi bhi ai
 The boy's brother three people behind him in front of the temple corner
 achaanak ladke ke bhai ke badan main bhayanak marod uthi or vah aangan par gir padaa
 From his feet to the head, the torrential waves started running
 usne haath se upar kii ore ishaara kiya
 Mother immediately ran upstairs
 band darvaaze kii kundi par haath rakhaa to vah barf-si thandi thi
 Mother opened the door
 ladkaa ek kone main baitha tha
 Light laughter came on his face
 maan ne mudakar neeche aangan main dekha
 The boy's brother was calm
 vah thahari hui aankhon se maan ko dekh rahaa tha
 Mother covered her mouth with pallu
 daravaaza khulaa chhodkar maan neeche chali ai
 The boy's brother sat down on his knees in awe
 usne apane haath ghutanon ke modon par rakh liye
 He took full support of the wall
 ladke ke gale par halki kharonch thi
 He wrote something on the courtyard with the index finger
 so gaya
 The next afternoon the boy disappeared from the house like a wind
 use ghar se nikalate hue koi na dekh paaya
 He was invisible
 uskaa peechha karnaa bekaar tha
 After walking for a mile and a half, the speed of that valley started to slow down
 vah sadak par tair rahaa tha, jaise mouj main koi tinkaa bahata ho
 He did not look up from the valley towards Tekri
 vah buudhe darakht tak pahunchaa or phir pahari kii chaaya vaale hisse main mud gaya
 He took a deep breath
 saans jo kal raat se gaayab thi
 The author of the book, Kishore Chaudhary, got a brief introduction
 jaise koi sarsaraahat thi
 He started feeling very relaxed
 ek hawa kaa jhonka chhukar lipat gaya
 He started getting free from the burden
 uske chaaron taraf halkaapan tha
 The heavy spears placed on the eyelids of his eyes started flying
 uske chahare par puta hua chuunaa jhadane laga
 The girl sat quietly on a large stone near the broken minaret on the hill
 hawa use isi tarah baithe dekhakar sihar uthi
 In the dense forest of silence, the shadow came
 ladke, o ladke
 He returned and came home
 bhai darvaaze par hi mil gaya
 "where did you go?" The laughter of the boy started falling, as if iron flowers were falling
 lohe ke girane kii awaz ghar bhar main fail gai
 The brother stood silent and the boy went into the house
 ek bada panchi karkash awaz main cheekhta hua ghar ke upar se niklaa
 In the evening came the door of the house through the potato fields
 halki maadak shaam
 Mother and sister-in-law smiled in front of the kitchen
 baba thode dur baithe the
 The boy's brother was not there
 ladkaa ek bench par leta hua tha
 He had books with him
 sab kitabon par laal rang ke kagaz ke khol the
 On the other hand, that girl rubbed off the body on a stale afternoon
 dopaher ke ve chhilake raat kii nami se bhiige hue the
 He stayed there
 bistar se neeche haath latakaae hue ladki sochati rahi ki use ladke se kya chahie
 a wind blows
 ek pathar gunagunaata
 There was a peep from the broken walls
 man ke khaali baratan main hawa kaa baaja
 The glow of humming jhaank kaa vismay
 All these things would come alive with the thinking of the boy
 jaise khoyi hui zindagi laut ai ho
 When this does not happen, the girl walks with the thief in the cover of the night on the roof
 use lagata jaise kaale phool bichhe hai
 The girl put her hand from the courtyard towards the roof
 usne donon haath upar kiye kaha- “aao, mere qareeb aao
 Pick me up from here ye zindagi nahin he
 This is a curse
 ye ruh kaa pahana hua takaleef kaa pairahan he
 come on boy
 o ladke
 Oh my dear boy ”ghar main soye hue ladke ko kuch hua
 He felt that any trouble was growing
 vah kuch hi dur he
 He got up from the bed
 usne daravaaza kholaa
 Looked at the courtyard below
 sab kuch sthir
 Incarceration things in night hypnosis
 pahari tekri kaa rasta yaad kiya
 He thought of the broken wall of the tower
 usne hawa kii awaz ko suna
 He remembered the girl
 subah ladkaa do ghante tak aangan kii usee bench par baitha kitaab padhata rahaa
 After this he ate food and came to his room
 dopaher hone se pehle jab vah apane kamare se baahar jane ke liye darvaaze tak aayaa to paaya ki daravaaza baahar se band he
 He grabbed the handle and pulled it but it did not open
 ladke ne awaz di
 Called mother koi jawaab na aayaa
 Baba called, no response was received
 bhai ko awaz di, uskaa bhi jawaab na aayaa
 Some of the boy's feet started climbing
 vah donon haathon se andar lagi hatthiyaan khinchne laga
 The door was firmly closed
 usne pukaara
 Callless ghar se dur-dur tak ladke kii awaz bikharati rahi
 The door latch used to move but did not break
 ladkaa kamare ke andar daudane laga
 He went to the window and made a noise
 do ghante tak daravaaza hilta rahaa
 Eventually the house became silent
 dopaher dhal chuki thi
 Brother slowly opened the door
 andar se koi halchal na hui
 Baba was standing behind his brother
 maan bhi thi
 The brother in his hand spread mustard seeds in front of the door
 haath main liye pani ke lote se donon taraf jal chhidaka
 He went inside tremblingly
 ladkaa bistar par so rahaa tha
 The brother gave a voice- “get up
 ”vah achraj se uthaa
 He said- "yes brother
 ”“kab se so rahe ho?”“pataa nahin
 Probably just slept
 ”“aao, neeche chalo
 They all came down
 vahaan ek teesraa aadmi tha
 The man asked- "did he go to the hill?" The boy remembered that he was locked in the room today
 vah udhaas hone laga
 The man said- "did you sit on a big stone near the broken tower
 kya tumne hawa main koi geet suna
 In a 16-year-old girl-like voice
 kya tumne dekha ki vahaan ghaas ke tinke hawa ke saath gol-gol udate rahete hai?”ladke ne kaha- “nahin
 The man breathed a long sigh of relief
 sabake chehron par chintaa kii rekhaayen mitane lageen
 The third man quickly said- "show your hands
" ” ladke ne apane haath aage kiye
 The man looked at the palms and came to rest
 usne ladke ke haath chhod die un haathon main kuch na tha
 Not a single red fiber
 teesraa aadmi uthaa kuch budbudaya or sukh bhare qadamon se chalaa gaya
 As soon as he left, the air began to cool in the house
 hawa har taraf se aa rahi thi
 Apart from this house situated at a small height in the township, all the houses were getting wind
 sirf hawa baj rahi thi baaki khaamoshi thi
 That night the boy's brother came to his room
 usne kaha ki mujhe tumko kuch bataanaa he
 The brother sat near him- "actually we were scared
 hamen laga tumko kuch ho gaya he
 He who is the tower of the tower is some shadow
 vahaan par jane waalon ko kuch ho jaataa he
 The wind touched whatever went so far
 hawa main geet sune
 He saw the wind dancing
 hawa khud vahaan logon ko upar khinch leti he
 While listening to his brother, the boy kept quiet with the support of the wall
 vah jo ladki thi use bhi dopaher ko haveli main qaid kar diya gaya
 He did not give voice to the doors
 usne hatthiyaan pakadakar nahin khinchin
 He remained silent
 jis tarah ladkaa ek din ke liye band kiya gaya tha uske ulat ladki ko anek dinon tak band rakhaa gaya
 Then one afternoon someone saw that boy and girl from the valley
 ve donon ek saath isi tekri par the
 When people came to find them, they did not meet here
 ve donon gaayab ho gaye the
 Never met anyone again
 gulzaan ne apni baat puri kar di
 Dibang was missing in thought
 gulzaan ne use yaad dilaayaa ki ab tumko jawaab dena hoga
 Dibang said- "ask, what is the question?" Gulzan asked- "tell where both of them went
 ”dibang ne mahasoos kiya ki is sawaal ke baad hawa achaanak ruk gai he
 Silence is getting deeper
 minar kii tuuti diwaar ke paas se koi jhaank hui
 There was a curse
 sab chizein gahare maun main kintu lagata he, sab bol rahi hon
 Stone, grass, sand, wind, dry patterns, everyone is saying something to him
 dibang ne kaha- “vah ladkaa ye minar ho gaya or ladki hawa ho gai
 Gulzan quickly filled Dibang in the arms
 vah rone lagi
 "how do you read my mind?" bataao kahan se siikhaa man ko padhanaa?” ve donon ek-duje kii banhon main tuuti minar ke paas vaale bade pathar par pade hue the
 His mind was soaked
 ve ek-duje ko chuum chuke the
 Dibang told Gulzan- "open your eyes and see
 ” gulzaan ne kaha- “uun hoon

 iity kanpur ke purv professor gurudas agarwal urf swami gyaan swaroop sanand ko bas ek hi phikr thi—ganga kii aviralata or nirmalata kis tarah barkaraar rahe
 Sanand's demand for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called Ganga as 'mother' during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and his government that promised to clean Ganga, was no different
 lekin sanand kii na to pradhanmantri ne suni or na hi bhaajapa kii centre yaa rajya sarkaar ne
 And, at last, Sanand, who was on hunger for Ganga, died on 11 October
 darasal, 86 varshiya sanand ne is saal 24 farvari ko pradhanmantri modi ko patr likhakar chaar maangen rakhi thim
 These demands were — to pass the proposed draft Act 2012 for Ganga, discussed in Parliament, repeal of rivers and proposed hydropower schemes being built in Uttarakhand, complete halt on forest cutting, mining and quarrying as per the draft Act of Ganga Mahasabha And formation of Ganga Bhakta Parishad
 parishad main 20 log pradhanmantri kii ore se namit hon or ve ganga tat par aakar sankalp len
 But he did not get any response from the Prime Minister or the government
 pradhanmantri or unke karyaalay ke ravaiye se niraash sanand ne haridwar ke paas matra sadan ashram main 22 june ko ann tyagkar anshan shuru kar diya
 He had also written a letter to give it to the Prime Minister
 par kisi ne unki sud nahin lee
 Eventually, he died after a 112-day fast
 isane sarkaar ke ravaiye ko benakaab kar diya he
 Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) leader Kashi Singh Ari says, "swami Sanand's demands may agree or disagree, but the way the Prime Minister ignores him and leaves him to die is very painful
" vah bhi us narendra modi kii chuppi jinhans sanyukt raashtra ne haal hi main champion of arth award se nawaja he
 This also raises questions on the award
 ''professor agarwal ne sanyas kii diksha lekar apana jivan ganga ke liye samarpit kar diya tha
 In 2012, he undertook a fast for 60 days in protest against the hydropower schemes under construction and large dams in the Ganges
 iske baad sarkaar ne ganga ko rashtriya nadi ghoshit kar diya tha or uske liye rashtriya athurity bhi bani thi
 He said that during his election campaign, the BJP had appealed for a vote for itself by redeeming people's faith in the name of cleaning the river Ganga, but all their claims and promises got fueled
 matra sadan ne sanand ke saath kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kii mobile phone par hui baatcheet kaa ek audio jari kiya he
 After trying to convince Sanand for some time there, the mercury of the Union Minister was gone
 unhone yah phone kaat diya tha, ''thik he, jaisaa chaaho karo
 Gadkari's attitude was very disappointing
 jaahir he, sanand ke jivan ko bachaane ke liye sarkari str par koi gambhir prayaas nahin hua
 The Congress alleges that the Ganga love of the Modi government has proved to be a sham by Sanand's death
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat is anshan ke dauraan kai baar haridwar gaye par unhone sanand kii khoj-khabar lenaa tak uchit nahin samajha
 That too when the party had appointed Rawat as the convenor of the Ganga cleanliness campaign before becoming the Chief Minister
 vaise, ravat kaa kahana he, ''rajya sarkaar ne is mudde par puri samvedansheeltaa dikhaai thi
 But despite all efforts, he refused to break the fast
 jaise hi unhone 9 aktubar ko jal kaa tyaag kiya, unhen fouran rishikesh ames main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The doctors of AIIMS also tried their best to save his life
 ''lekin ames, rishikesh main sanand ke antim darshan ke liye pahunche jal purush rajendra singh ne kaha, ''sarkaar ne swami sanand kii maangon ko ansuna kiya he, sarkaar ko iskaa dand bhugatna hoga
 The AIIMS administration did not allow his last visit
 sarkaar ko dar he ki koi unke balidaan se prerana na paske
 "actually, the AIIMS administration did not allow this to come to Sanand's last visit
" jab rajendra singh samet kuch log ames main hi dharne par baith gaye, tab jaakar ames prashasan ko unhen darshan kii ijaajat deni padi
 Some people are calling Sanand's death a murder
 haridwar main maa ganga mishan ne ek divasiy dharna dekar isaki sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 At the same time, the head of the Mother House, Swami Shivanand Saraswati, described Sanand's death as a murder at the behest of the government
 unka aarope he ki haridwar jila prashasan, ames ke diarector or kendriya mantri gadakari sanand kii 'hatya' ke liye jimmedaar hai
 On behalf of the Mother House, Brahmachari Dayanand has given a complaint against all these
 unka kahana he, ''jab swami sanand ko matra sadan se laayaa gaya tha to unki haalat thik thi
 But he died on 11 October, it is a conspiracy to assassinate him
 vahiin, ames nideshak ne media ko bhi jhootha bayaan diya ki swami sanand par anshan nahin todgaye ke liye dabaav diya ja rahaa tha
 After Sanand's death, another saint in the Mother House, Gopaldas, living in Guhana, Haryana, sat on hunger strike
 unhen der raat 13 aktubar ko jila prashasan ne jabaran ames, rishikesh main bhartee kara diya
 After being discharged, he again sat on hunger strike
 uttarakhand ke alag-alag sthanon par gopaldaas ke anshan ke 16 aktubar ko 116 din puure ho gaye hai
 At present, the BJP government is dismissing various allegations about Sanand's death, but the stains of this saint's death are not going to be washed away by his 'cleanliness drive'
 swami sanand ne pradhanmantri se ganga ke liye chaar maangen kii thim
 But they did not get any answer from him
 niraash hokar sanand anshan par baith gaye theore kitne balidaan?haridwar ke paas kankhal thana kshetra ke jagajeetpur main 1998 main ganga ke kinare matra sadan ashram kii sthapana hui thi
 Since then, it has become an institution of sacrificers for the Ganges
 swami sanand se pehle bhi is sanstha ke do brahmacharee apana balidaan de chuke hai
 Of these, Nigamananda Saraswati's sacrifice was also mainly for the Ganges
 matra sadan ke santon ne jab dhwani pradooshan or ganga main avaidh khanan par roak lagane kii maang ko lekar sangharsh shuru kiya tha to ve sthaneey nivaasiyon or phir khanan mafia ke nishane par aa gaye the
 Many times these saints were attacked, but they did not give up the struggle to protect the Ganges
 kankhal main 1998 main nigamanand ke saath swami gokulanand ne krashar or khanan mafia ke khilaaf anshan shuru kiya tha
 Nigamananda Saraswati died on 13 June 2011 at Jollygrant Hospital in Dehradun while on a hunger strike demanding a ban on mining in the Ganges for nearly 78 days
 uske baad swami gokulanand ne us maang ko aage badhaate hue anshan kiya
 In 2013, Gokulananda had gone for confinement, but his body was found in Bamani, Nainital
 unhen jehar dekar maar daalane kaa aarope bhi laga tha
 Now after Sanand's death, Saint Gopaldas has also sat on fast in the Mother House
 matra sadan ke paramadhyaksh shivanand saraswati kehete hai, ''matrusadan ganga ke liye koi bhi balidaan dene ko tatpar he
 '' Swami Nigamananda *** kabhi-kabhi romaanch ke chakkar main jaan jokhim main bhi pad sakati he

 When the Janata Party government was formed in 1977, Shanta Kumar became the Chief Minister of Himachal
 iske baad 1982 main vidhansabha chunaav main janata party ko congress se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Congress again came to power in the 1985 assembly elections
 lekin iske baad 1990 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi prachand bahumat ke saath satta main waapas ai or shanta kumaar mukhyamantri bane

 " rajasthan kaa ek jila kota bahut teji se aage badha
 The entire economy of this district grew due to the coaching institutes which have gradually strengthened their roots
 lekin is shahar ke saath ek kalank judata ja rahaa he, mana jane laga he ki dhire-dhire kota aatmahatya kii nagari banati ja rahi he
 Recently, 3 students committed suicide here
 iske baad india today ne yahaan kaa daura kar jamini hakeekat jaanane kii koshish kii ki ejineering or medical kii taiyaari karne aae chaatro main se kuch log aakhir yahaan maut ko kyon gale laga lete hai?kota ko desh ke koching hub kaa tamgaa mila hua he
 But this did not happen overnight
 kareeb 2 dashak pehle is jile ko industrial toun ke rup main janaa jaataa tha jahaan laghu udyog chal rahe the
 Units of electrical equipment, clothes etc
 were working here
 dhire-dhire ye ikaiyaan peeche chali gai hai or koching centreo kaa vistaar hota gaya
 Kota itself is being considered synonymous with success, millions of students from different states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal come here to achieve their goals
 dekha gaya he ki kuch rajyon ke silebus alag hote hai
 The quality of education at primary and secondary levels also varies among different states
 kshamta na rahete hue bhi chaatr par dabaav banaaya jaataa he ki vah pratiyogita main safal hon
 This results in a false result
 iaiti kii taiyaari karne bihar se aae chandan kumaar ne india today ko bataaya, 'main 6 maheene pehle bihar se IIT kii taiyaari karne kota aayaa, main bihar main rahata tha, bihar main meraa ghar he
 If i had realized that i would clear the exam from there, then why would i come here? Last time when i had given this exam, the result was not good, so thought to try one more time
 'har saal dedh lakh chaatr aate hai kotahar saal takreeban dedh lakh se zyada chaatr kota main vibhinn pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari karne aate hai, inamen se adhikansh rajasthan ke baahar ke hote hai
 Markets have been developed here to meet their needs
 kota main isi ko lekar bahut saare ghar, apartment, complex, restaurant, food joint khul gaye hai jo chaatro ke bal par chal rahe hai
 This has created an atmosphere of coaching here
 baari pad jaati hai maa-baap kii apekshaayenlakhon chaatr yahaan vibhinn parikshaon jaise iaiti or ames kii taiyaari karte hai, lekin inamen se bahut aise hote hai jinamein pratiyogita main safal hone kii kshamta nahin hoti
 Many times it happens that the students are buried under the expectations of the parents who are living far away
 ghar se dur rahete hue unhen koi bhaavnaatmak or manovaigyanik dabaav ke chalate sankat kii ghadi main wo soch hi nahin pate ki unhen aakhir karnaa kya chahie
 Not knowing how to overcome extreme pressure and stress, many youngsters take such steps in which their life ends
 kai chaatro kaa base hota he kamjorupi se aakar IIT kii taiyaari karne ai apurva aroda ne india today ko bataaya ki sabase badi baat yah he ki kai chaatro kii padhai kaa base hi bahut kamjor hota he
 That is, they are backward only in their 10th and 11th studies
 iaiti ke liye jis tarah ke quality ajukeshan kii jarurat hoti he vah unke paas hoti hi nahin
 Coaching class consists of many students
 padhai main kamjor chaatr vahaan sankochavash sawaal bhi nahin kar paata
 Gradually he falls further behind and goes into depression
 is saal 15 chaatro ne kii aatmahatyise saal kareeb 15 se zyada chaatro ne kota main apni jaan de di
 Some of these students were from such families in UP Bihar, whose parents had sent them quota for coaching by taking loans or mortgaging their property
 aise main unke upar kabhi-kabhi dabaav bhi hota tha
 Many students told India Today that the kind of rationality required for competitive exams is not mentioned in primary and secondary classes
 kai pradeshon kii shiksha main is tarah kii kami dekhi jaati he lekin aise chaatr jab taiyaari ke liye kota aa jate hai to unhen alag mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 First screening, in case of difficulty Counselinghop Foundation President Doctor M
 el
 Aggarwal says that students who want to come to Kota and prepare
 sabase pehle unki screening honi chahie ki unamem yogyata he yaa nahin, kahin unke avsaad kaa koi itihaas to nahin, manovaigyanik rup se wo majboot hai yaa nahin
 If the student is not fit for that field then his career counseling should be done, he should be told that he is eligible for another field
 doosraa, bacchon ko guide karne vaale clinics khulne chahie jisase samay-samay par unhen sahaayta milti rahe
 One year cost of one and a half rupees to 5 lakh rupees, students coming from UP, MP quota spend from one and half rupees to 5 lakh rupees per year in preparation for competitive examinations here
 kuch aise chaatr jinaki haisiyat itani nahin hoti, jinke parents lone yaa udhaar lekar kota bhejte hai wo chaatro par anuchit dabaav bhi daalate hai ki agar wo safal nahin hue to kya hoga
 It has also been seen that if a student is not able to succeed in the competitive exam in the initial stages, then there is a lot of pressure on him
 'padhane bhejein, na banaaen rigelt kaa dabaav'moshan privet ajukeshan limited ke nitin vijay kaa kahana he ki kabhi-kabhi chaatro par itnaa zyada dabaav padane lagata he ki mushkil ho jaati he
 'we try to convince the parents that if you have spent money on the education of the child, then do not pressurize the result in return for it'
 sansad main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf hue is pradarshan main pehle left ke aane kii baat thi, lekin phir sipiem ne ye kah kar khud ko alag kar liya ki 'tiemasi ne na keval vampanthi kaaryakartaaon kii hatya kii he balki trinmul ke netaa taapas paul ne sipiem kii mahila kaaryakartaaon ke khilaaf abhadra bayaan bhi diya he
 Therefore the Left is not part of this joint protest

 lekin inhen saarvajanik kal hi kiya gaya he or parmaanu samjhaute kii nigaraanee kar rahe international atomic energy agency kii website par inhen daalaa gaya he
 According to the agreement, Iran can only possess less enriched uranium that cannot be used to make weapons and it also has a limit of 300 kg which is not enough to make weapons
 tippaniyan When this agreement was reached, Iran had less than 100 kg of enriched uranium-containing liquid or solid waste
 kal jari dastavejon main ghoshnaa kii gai he uske paas maujuud kam sanvardhit euronium pun: praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa isliye yah 300 kilo kii seemaa kaa hissaa nahin he
 One reason for the release of the document is that the forthcoming US administration has expressed a desire to exit the agreement by giving notice
 kuch dastavej 6 janvari, 2016 ke hai, iske kuch hi samay baad samjhauta lagu ho gaya tha
 But these have been made public yesterday and have been put on the website of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring the nuclear deal
 samjhaute ke mutabik iran keval kam sanvardhit uranium hi rakh saktaa he jiskaa istemaal hathiyaar banane main nahin kiya ja saktaa or isaki bhi seemaa 300 kilogram tak he jo hathiyaar banane ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 The comments jab yah samjhauta hua tab iran ke paas 100 kilogram se zyada kam sanvardhit uranium yukt taral yaa thos kachra tha
 In the documents released yesterday, it has been announced that the less enriched uranium it possesses cannot be recovered so it is not part of the 300 kg limit
 dastavej jari karne kii ek vajah yah he ki aagaamee america prashasan ne notice dekar samjhaute se baahar hone kii ichha jataai he

 hunar hi nayaa hathiyaar he
 If the youth of this country are given a lot of work potential and the skills required for them are taught, then the youth of the country can build a new India
 ” pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 28 sitambar, 2014 ko america main neuyork ke medicin squaire ke apane bahucharchit bhaashan main yah aahvaan kar sanket diya tha ki viksit bharat banane kii chaabi hunarmand yuvaaon kii mutthi main chhipi he
 Actually, the current situation of the country is that on the one hand, crores of youth have degrees, whose education is not suitable for jobs in industries, on the other hand there is such an army of less educated mechanic-craftsmen who are working, But they do not have professional training to work with
 america jaise viksit deshon main 90 fisadi kamgaaron ke paas unke kaam se judi peshewar training he, jabaki bharat main 5-6 fisadi kaamgaar hi peshewar nazariye se hunarmand hai
 In such a situation, the success of many ambitious campaigns from "swachh Bharat" to "make in India" is hidden whether India can build an army of at least 15 crore skilled people in the next 10 years
 aisa nahin he ki desh main yah sawaal pehali baar uth rahaa he
 When Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister, when the Ministry of Education was changed to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, its basic objective was to promote professional education
 isi tarah manmohan singh sarkaar 2009 main rashtriya kaushal vikaas niti bhi isi uddeshy ke tahat laai, lekin 2012 tak 5 karod logon ko hunarmand banane kaa lakshya puraa nahin kar pai
 There are currently more than 12,500 itis operating in the country, whose main job is to manufacture technicians like plumber, fitter, AC and TV electrician
 modi sarkaar kaa nayaa kaushal vikaas mantralay bhi inhen puraani yojanaon ko nae tevar ke saath lagu karne kii ek koshish he
 Dilip Chinoy, Chairman of the Hundred National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), says millions of hands, "institutions like ITI have failed to live up to their role
 aise main nae kism ke paathyakram, certificate or sansthaanon kii jarurat he jo udyog or vartmaan jaruraton ke hisaab se kam samay main yuvaaon ko prashikshit kar saken
 More than 1,000 certificate courses under the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSNUF) will have a greater emphasis on practice than theory
 is baat kii khaas taakid hogi ki ye na sirf bharat ke liye maanak bane, balki duniya ke kisi bhi viksit desh ke maanakon par khare utren
 Whenever Modi visits a country, he definitely makes some agreements regarding skill development there
 britain, germany, australia, france or america jaise pramukh deshon sahit kai deshon se is bare main samjhaute ho chuke hai
 The government is active in connecting private and public sector undertakings in this work
 desh bhar main 17,000 prashikshan centre enesdisi se jud chuke hai
 In addition to skill development under government schemes, vocational education is being imparted according to the demand of industries
 prashikshan kendron kaa jaalis pahal kii kamyaabi ke bare main desh bhar main 40 se adhik centaron main yuvaaon ko prashikshan de rahe ilaphes skills deveopment korporation ke assistant vaais president ankur ahuja bataate hai, “zyaadaatar maamalon main daakhila udyogon kii maang ke hisaab se hi kiya jaataa he
 Every center has 4 to 5 trades
 ” in sansthaanon main 3 se 6 maheene kii training or certificate lene ke baad vyakti udyog kii jaruraton ke lihaaj se pakkaa ho jaataa he
 Ahuja says that 75 percent of the youth training in ILFS centers is sponsored by the government, 10 to 12 percent is spent on public and private enterprises under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and 8 percent is spending out of their own pocket
 are doing
 shuruyaat main in yuvaaon ko 7,000 ru 
 14,000 to Rs
 tak kii naukari mil jaati he
 Preeti, who has taken a course in retail from ILFS, says, “I and 10 of my colleagues have just come to Pantaloon for interviews
 ” unhen or unke saathiyon ko kisi jaanane vaale ne sanstha ke okhla centre ke bare main bataaya tha
 These people have passed 12th standard
 yahaan kii training ke jariye ve naukari karenge oraisi naukarise apni aage kii padhai kaa kharch uthaane kaa iraadaa rakhte hai
 On the other hand, 23-year-old Bilal Ahmed Malik of Tral district of Jammu and Kashmir is training CNC at Indian Institute of Skill Development (IISD) in Gurgaon, Haryana
 ejineering main diploma or uske baad maikenical main beatech karne ke baad kuch maheene ke vokational course main daakhila lenaa kuch ajeeb nahin he? is sawaal par malik kehete hai, “degree to mili lekin hunar nahin aayaa
 Along with studying here, the institute has promised jobs
 padhai kaa kharch sarkaar uthaa rahi he
 "in fact, Malik is taking training under the" Udaan "scheme of the central government, in which 40,000 youths of Jammu and Kashmir are to be made jobless and made employable in five years
 siensi kii training ke baad malik jaise yuva automobile companiyon ke parts banane vaale technitian ban jaaenge
 Challenges are no less: Youngsters like Priti and Bilal are convinced to get a job after studying in prestigious training centers in Delhi and Gurgaon, but will everyone get a job? This question is not easy
 enesdisi ke prashikshan kendron se nikle yuvaaon ke naukari paane kii dar abhi 58 fisadi hi he
 Chinoy says, "our aim is not to give jobs, but to make youth eligible
 bahut se maamalon main ladke naukari karne kii bajaae khud kaa kaam karnaa pasand karte hai
 “apart from increasing the rate of placements, it is also a big challenge to create mutual coordination between the central government ministries
 vajah yah he ki kaushal vikaas kii is yojana main paanch saal main 5 lakh karod ru
 It is estimated that is samay centre sarkaar ke 20 se zyada mantralay apni-apni skill deveopment yojanaayen chalaa rahe hai jabaki kaushal vikaas fund main mahaj 1,500 karod ru
 Huh
 isliye mantralayon kii yojanaon ko jodna hoga
 Nevertheless there will be a huge shortage
 iskaa prabandhan kahaan se hoga, yahi bada sawaal he
 Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Minister of State (independent Charge) for Skill Development, says, “every big dream starts at a small level
 samaaj, udyog or sarkaar ke sahyog se dhire-dhire sambhav ho jayega
 "(see: talk) The challenge is that just as ITI has not been able to play its role in a long time, what guarantee is there that these new skill development centers will be successful
 kya itii se kamjor aarthik sansadhano vaale ye centre itii se behatar nattejey de paaenge?mushkilen hai to hal bhi hanchinoy kehete hai, “inhen sawaalon ke hal main to enesdisi juty he
 “the objective of government agreements with developed countries is to get better technology and better trainers from there
 agar udyogon ko ham yah bharosa dilaa paae ki in certifikates se las yuva unke kaam kaa he to udyog is disha main behatar nivesh karenge
 As far as the quality of training institutes is concerned, detailed standards have been made for this
 kahin sarkari sponcership vaali yojanaon main pehle kii tarah phir farji chaatro ko dikhaakar paisa kha liya gaya to? aise kai maamalon kii jaanch-padtaal chal rahi he
 Says Chinoy, "many ministries have put conditions for biometric attendance and a three-month salary slip for a student who is employed
 lekin hamaari koshish he ki samaaj khud apane aapako aage badhaane kii lalak paidaa kare
 If you continue with the investigation and look suspiciously, then how will the dream of Skilled India be fulfilled? ” rail mantri suresh prabhu guuruuvaar ko apana pehlarel bajatpesh karne vaale hai
 Expectations and aspirations of passengers from all over the country are attached to the rail budget
 yah bajet is myne bhi mahatvapurn he ki agle saal se centre sarkaar rail mantralay ke bajet ko aam bajet ke tahat pesh kar sakati he
 There are many challenges like reduction in rail fares, new trains, convenience, safety and most of all railway reservation, while the government has a big chance to woo people amid the grudges on the land acquisition bill
 haalanki, is rail bajet se yatri kiraye or maal bhaade main kami kii ummid kam he
 It is understood that the government will emphasize on safety and convenience
 jabaki network ko badhaane ke babat kai bade elaan jisamen epadiai bhi shaamil he, ko lekar elaan ho saktaa he
 In the midst of all this, there is also the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi i
e
 the bullet train
 sapana or hakikatnigahen suresh prabhu par hai ki kya vah pradhanmantri modi kaa sapana puraa kar sakate hai, kyonki 9 coach kii bullate train kii keemat he 60 hajaar karod rupee he or 17 coach kii rajdhani express kaa kharch 75 karod he
 That is, 800 Rajdhani Express can run in the budget of a bullet train
 to phir tej raftaar kise chahie or agar chahie to phir maujuuda patariyon par khisakati rail gadiyon ke din phirenge kab
 Railway track is also a big responsibility
 In the current time, a big question is also about the operation of trains
 bhartiya railway kii letlatifi jagajaahir he or iske peeche trek badi samasya he
 For the last thirty years, governments have never had 20 thousand crore to 50 thousand crore rupees to fix railway tracks and expand the railway through new railway tracks
 iskaa asar yah hua ki har din 95 lakh log bina seat mili hi railgadee main safar karte hai
 The condition of railway track in the country is such that about 30 thousand kilometers of track needs to be improved and 40 thousand kilometers of new railway track has been suppressed under the announcement of last 10 years
 yani koi bhi rail kii halaat dekh kar kah saktaa he ki aazaadee ke baad se hi railway infrastracchar ko desh ke vikaas ke saath jodne kii disha main kisi ne sochaa hi nahin
 Every day a quarter of a quarter crore rural and laborers have come in this era under Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 modi ne desh ko bullate train kaa sapana dikhalaayaa he
 So, is the real truth of the country that the country's development is unilateral and urban centralized
 lekin train main safar karne vaale zyaadaatar log gramin or majdoor tabake se hai
 Their number is close to 1
25 billion every day
 vajah bhi yahi he ki bhartiya rail kii tasviir jab bhi aankadon main ubhartee he to upar se neeche tak thasathas bhare yatri or raftaar kareeb 50 se 60 kilometre prati ghante kii najar aati he
 That is, the question is the first of the common man, who rides on a train with a life palm, because there is no other option
 aise main rail bajet par ek baar phir aam aadmi kii nigaah he, jo 67 saal baad bhi jarurat ke vakt train main berth, vakt par trainon kaa aagaman, kalabazari se raahat, saaf pani or suraksha jaisi buniyadi baaten maang rahaa he
 So will Suresh Prabhu make any special announcement for the marginalized general traveler in the Railway Budget presented on Thursday or will he dream of making the railway modern by riding on corporate capital
 jahaan bullate train, hai speed train, trainon main wifai, steshnon ko modern banane ke liye pipipi model or epadiai kii zyada baat hogi
 Food quality and catering Indian Railways recently announced that now pizza will also be served in trains
 dominoj se is ore qaraar kiya gaya he
 But despite the questions and efforts on how the common passenger's food served in the rail, the story of failure is not new
 aae din, khaane main gandagi, basi khaanaa or aisi hi kai shikaayatein sunne ko milti hai
 So total trust 'prabhu' trust on the train on which the central government is trying to woo the common man from the corporate sector
 unheen suresh prabhu ke saamne chunautiyon kaa ambara bhi he
 However, the wait is Thursday when Suresh Prabhu will put the Rail Budget on the Table of the House
 dilli gangrape ke aaropee or kathith taur par khudakushi karne vaale ram singh ke bhai ne aaj daawa kiya ki uski hatya kii gai or kaha ki usne shav par chot ke nishaan or gale par ungali ke nishaan dikhe
 The comments unhone kaha ki parivaar singh ke sharir ko rajasthan ke karauli gaanv le jayega jahaan unka antim sanskaar kiya jayega
 On condition of anonymity, the brother said, "my brother was killed
" maine shav par chot ke nishaan or gale par ungali ke nishaan dekhe
 Meanwhile, Singh's body was mortified at AIIMS here
