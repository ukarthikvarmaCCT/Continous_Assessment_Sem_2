 ) The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party have not taken any lessons despite Indore MLA Akash Vijayvargiya misbehaving with a government official
 taaja maamla sagar jile ke binaa kaa he jahaan se bhartiya janata party ke vidhayak kaa ek sarkari adhikari ke saath kahasuni kaa video viral ho rahaa he
 In fact, BJP MLA Mahesh Rai from Bina had reached with the party workers to give a memorandum to the SDM office regarding the problem of increased electricity bills
 lekin esadm karodi laal meena apane chambar se baahar gyaapan lene nahin nikle or unhen tehseeldaar ko gyaapan dene ko kaha
 Just because of this, the mla's mercury reached the seventh sky and he heard the SDM in his own office very fiercely
 vidhayak kii naaraazgi yaheen khatm nahin hui balki unhone esadm karyaalay main hi esadm murdaabaad ke naare lagavaana shuru kar die
 During this, the angry BJP MLA told the SDM that 'now you have a new posting, you are new and you do not know how to talk to an MLA
 'bijepi vidhayak mahesh raay ne puure ghatnakram ke bare main kaha, 'vidhansabha kshetra ke log mere paas bijli bill ke vishay main aae the or karja maafee kii bhi baat kar rahe the
 Regarding the same, all the workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party had decided with the general public that on Monday, we will give the memorandum to the SDM at 11 am and we reached the office to give the same memorandum to the SDM
 lekin us dauraan bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke saath esadm kaa ashobhaneey bartaav rahaa
 He further said that he continued to sit and talk on his own while i stood in front of him as an MLA
 aise adhikari aaj jaanboojh ke bhartiya janata party ke kaaryakartaaon ko pratadit or unki beijjati karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 bjp's support for the MLA: It is a matter of surprise that the Bharatiya Janata Party has not learned any lesson even after Akash Vijayvargiya's assault on a government official
 yahi vajah he ki bina main vidhayak dwaara sarkari adhikari ke saath kiye gaye bartaav kaa bijepi ne samarthan kiya he
 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Aggarwal has said that, 'bina is not only insulting the SDM MLA and the people of the area but is giving false examples by turning her back on her responsibility
 jo adhikari gyaapan lene or bijli bill peediton se milane se inkaar kare use congress sarkaar kaa "sachcha adhikari" hi kaha jayega
 The BJP spokesperson further said, 'people are upset that the public representatives have come to speak and give their memorandum, they were only urging them to talk together and take the memorandum, but there is a disturbance in the comfort of Majal Hai Lat Sahab
 janata or janpratinidhiyon ke apmaan va upeksha ko bhaajapa katai sweekaar nahin karegi

 The issue of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, apprehending 'civil war', the Congress was shocked
 congress ko lagata he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne pehle rajyasabha main apane bayaan se phir press conference kar masale ko aage kar deshbhar main hindu-muslim dhruvikaran karne kii koshish kii
 The party believes that Mamata's aggressive attitude gave this opportunity to Amit Shah
 congress ke aalaa sutara maanate hai ki mamata ko to bengal main is rukh se koi dikkat nahin, lekin bengal samet bijepi isse desh bhar main siyaasi phayda uthaane ke liye har hatkandaa apnayegi
 In fact, the Congress had made a strategy not to be aggressive on this issue, but to raise questions about the flaws in implementing it
 saath hi wo kahati rahi ki rajeev gandhi ne samjhaute par dastakhat kiye the
 It started under the supervision of the Supreme Court during the Manmohan Singh government, so the Congress is not against it
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kuch isi tarj par fasebuk pej par apana stand bhi likh diya
 In view of the politics of the Center, the opposition of Mamata's statement to the Congress of Bengal and Assam, the attitude of Mamata on the NRC forced the Congress to keep its side separate from Mamata
 kendriya str par aisa karne se donon dalon ke rishton par asar padataa isliye mangalvaar der shaam congress ke ranneetikaron ne assam or bengal main party uniton se mamata se alag stand lene ko kaha
 Let us know that on Wednesday, a meeting of Mamta, Sonia and Rahul is scheduled at 10 Janpath
 pehle bengal congress adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary or phir assam congress adhyaksh ripun bora ne mamata ke bayanon se khud ko alag kiya
 Repun Bora even said that this statement of Mamta would prove to be suicidal
 iske baad congress ke do bade ranneetikaar ahamed patel or ghulaam nabi aaazaad ne isi masale par mamata ke 10 janpath jane se pehle sansad bhawan main unase mulaakaat kii
 According to sources, the two leaders expressed concern of the party to Mamata and also requested the BJP to take care of it if they do not get a chance to take political advantage
 rahul se jaakar milane se mamata kaa parhez, sonia ke ghar par mamata se mulaakaat main hi rahul rahenge maujuud-mamata ne dilli aakar jo tevar apanaaye, usase aisa sandesh gaya ki, yahi puure vipaksh kii raay he
 After this, Congress came back on the back foot
 ek taraf khud rahul piem pad ke liye mamata ko samarthan dene se gurej nahin karne kii baat kar chuke hai
 Rahul is now Congress president, not Sonia
 iske baavjood mamata dilli aane par upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi se milane ‘10, janpath’ hi ja rahi hai
 However Rahul will also be present there, on which Mamta does not mind
 saafe he ki, abhi bhi mamata rahul ke bajaae sonia ko congress kii sheersh netaa maanati hai
 However, Congress does not have any problem with this at the moment
 party ranneetikaron ko lagata he ki sonia ke naam par hi sahi agar mamata jaisi tewaron vaali netaa vipakshi paale main congress ke saath judi rahen, wo vakt ke saath vipakshi ekajutata kii jarurat he
 That is why Rahul also gave a statement in favor of Mamta
 mamata buudhvaar shaam ko hi aam aadmi party ke pramukh or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se bhi milane vaali hai
 The main objective of Mamata's visit to Delhi is to invite all the opposition leaders for their big rally to be held on January 19 next year

 britain ne ise antarrashtriya jalmaarg kaa ulanghan bataaya or america, britain, france or nato ne ise iran kii ore se antarrashtriya jal kshetra main nevigation ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan qaraar diya
 Now Britain has sent ships of Royal Navy to Hormuz Strait for the protection of their ships
 america ke do yudhpot pehle se hi is ilaake main deraa daale hue hai
 This latest case of tension has come to light when British Royal Marines seized a tanker 'grace' from Iran from Gibraltar this month, amid growing tension with the US over the Iranian nuclear program
 is bich america ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki hormuj kii khadi main tainaat uske yudhpot ne ek irani drone ko maar giraaya
 The rising tension between Iran and Western countries is indicating a major crisis in the Gulf region
 or iskaa centre ban rahaa he hormuj street
 Increased tension over Iranian nuclear program, with the US tightening its grip on Iran after the international nuclear deal broke down, Iran's oil exports were completely banned from May
 iske baad bharat samet tamaam deshon ko irani tel lenaa band karnaa padaa tha
 After this, Iran had threatened that if a drop of its oil was stopped, not a single drop of oil would be allowed out of the Hormuz Strait

 Since the iran-iraq War, there have been many attacks in Hormuz
 is saal british tanker pakadaney ke alaava saudi tankeron par hamale ke aarope bhi iran par lage hai
 There has always been tension over the control of the waters, the movement of ships from this area is in accordance with the UN law for navigation in the sea area
 haalanki tamaam deshon kii ore se kai baar inhen maanane se inkaar karne par tanaav bad jaataa he
 The Iranian claim, especially in the Hormuz Strait, has led to several tensions
 ateet par gaur karen to april 1959 main iran ne hormuj street par apana daawa jataate hue ilaake main apni samudri seemaa kaa 12 notical mil tak vistaar kar liya or elaan kiya ki is ilaake se sirf hamaari anumati ke baad hi antarrashtriya jahaaj guzar paaenge
 In July 1972, Oman also increased its maritime boundary by 12 nautical miles
 iske saath hi hormuj street par puri tarah donon deshon kaa kabja ho gaya
 However, the movement of international ships was not stopped
 lekin may 1993 main iran ne samudri nauvahan ke liye aisa kanoon lagu kiya jisase yuan code kaa ulanghan ho rahaa tha
 Accordingly, warships, submarines and nuclear-rich vessels would have to get permission before passing through Iranian waters
 kab-kab bane tanaav ke halaat?- ek din kaa yuddh1984 main iran-iraq yuddh ke vakt bhi iraqi hamalon ke baad jahaajon kii awajahi par asar padaa tha
 But the first conflict in the Hormuz Strait over the movement of international ships occurred in 1988 when the US waged a one-day war against the Iranian Navy over a confrontation with ships, called Operation Preying Mantis
 ye oparation 14 april 1988 ko irani nausena dwaara uassoes samuel bi
 Roberts turned against putting the Iranian mine ahead of the ship
 america navy ne iran kaa ek frigate, ek ganbot or 6 hathiyaarband speedbot dubo diya

 iran ne america ko kadaa sabak sikhaane kaa elaan kiya
 - On 8 January 2007, the US nuclear submarine was passing through the USS Newport underwater Hormuz Strait when it collided with Japanese oil tanker MV Mogamigawa
 haalanki isamen tel lik nahin hua naa hi koi ghayal hua
 Between December 2007 and January 2008, there were several confrontations between the American warship and Iranian speed boat stationed in the area of hormuz Strait
 iske baad donon deshon main aarope-pratyarope tej ho gaye
 - On 29 June 2008, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced their new security policy and announced that if there was any attack from the US and Israel, they would stop the traffic in the Hormuz Strait and create economic devastation around the world
 irani dhamkee kaa jawaab dene ke liye bahrain sthit paanchaven america yudhpot ne persia kii khadi ko paar kiya or america navy commander ne kaha ki ham duniya ke ek tihaai tel aapurti kii vyavastha ko iran kaa bandhak nahin banane denge
 - In July 2008, dozens of war ships from several countries arrived in Hormuz Strait and conducted military exercises under the leadership of the US to respond to the Iranian declaration
 iran ke tat ke paas pashchimi deshon ke abhyaas se tanaav ke halaat ban gaye
 In August 2008, more than 40 ships headed by the American Navy ship headed to the Hormuz Strait
 haalanki, iran kii ore se koi pratikriya nahin hui to philhal takaraav tal gaya
 In 2012, tensions in the region increased after the US sanctions on Iran were imposed
 3 janvari 2012 ko persia kii khadi se america yudhpot ke hatate hi iran ne elaan kar diya ki ab isaki vaapasi nahin hone denge or ye aakhri chetavanee he
 In response, the US Navy announced that its warship is returning soon and whoever stops it will have military action against it
 france bhi iran ke khilaaf utar aayaa
 It also appealed to the European Union to implement US sanctions on Iran and send its state-of-the-art warship to the Persian Gulf
 british jahaajon ne bhi ilaake main gasht badha di
 After the Iranian ballistic missile test in August 2018, it was claimed that Iran has now achieved the capability to target ships
 iran ne elaan kiya ki ilaake main koi bhi atikaraman use karrwai ke liye uksaane vaala hoga
 - After the break up of the international nuclear deal in April 2019, the US imposed new sanctions on Iran, since then a new round of tension has started
 iske baad britain dwaara irani tel tanker pakadana, america jasuson ko pakadaney kaa iran kaa daawa, america drone maar giraane kaa iran kaa daawa or phir iran dwaara british tel jahaaj pakadaney ke baad ilaake main tanaav bad gaya he or kabhi bhi sangharsh kaa rup le saktaa he
 Iran's dispute with Western countries The world is currently witnessing tensions with the Western world regarding Iran's nuclear programs, but the history of tension in this area is very old
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui jab 1950 ke dashak main america madad se iran ke pradhanmantri mohammad mosadik kii sarkaar kaa takhtapalat hua
 When Iran's rule came in the hands of pro-american Mohammad Raza Pahlavi, the world saw a round of iran-us cooperation
 islamic kranti ke baad bigadi batlekin 1979 main hui islamic kranti or phir ayatollah khumaini ke satta par prabhaav ke baad iran-america kii dushmani kaa jo daur shuru hua wo aaj tak barkaraar he
 In 1979, Iranian Islamic protesters captured the US Embassy in Tehran
 ye bandhak sankat 444 dinon tak jari rahaa
 Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein received full US support against Iran even in the iran-iraq war of 1980 to 1988
 in sab halaaton main bade tanaav ke bich aaj tak iran or america ke bich kootnithik sambandh kaayam nahin ho sake
 And now once the nuclear agreement is broken, the Gulf region is moving towards tension

 basapa pramukh mywati ne 24 saal puraani dushmani bhulaakar loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh yadav ke saath haath milaayaa tha
 Even after this, both could not stop the victory chariot of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh
 isi ke chalate loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ke mahaj 12 din baad hi basapa ne sapa ke saath gathbandhan todane kaa sanket die the
 Now on Sunday, the way Mayawati fiercely attacked Akhilesh Yadav and accused him of cheating, after this there is no scope of friendship between the two
 bataa den ki basapa ke 35 saal ke siyaasi safar main yah pehla mauka nahin jab mayawati ne kisi gathbandhan ko choda he
 Mayawati has been breaking and breaking alliances at different times according to her political advantages
 phir chaahe wo guest house cond ke baad mulaayam singh kaa saath chhodana ho yaa phir apana 6 maheene kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad kalyaan singh kii sarkaar se samarthan waapas lenaa ho
 After this, after reaching 10 seats from zero in the Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati broke the alliance by throwing the head of Akhilesh defeat
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya mayawati ek baar phir avasarwaad kii siyasat kar rahi hai
 Natabaspa was founded by Kanshi Ram in 1984 and first tested the alliance formula in 1993 after the guest house scandal broke
 basapa ne mulaayam singh yadav kii sapa ke saath milakar 1993 main uttar pradesh main vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladaa
 In this election, the slogan of 'mulayam Kanshi Ram, Jai Shri Ram flew in the wind' and SP-BSP alliance got tremendous benefit
 sapa 256 siton par chunaav ladakar 109 par jeet darj kii vahiin basapa 164 seat par ladi or 67 siten apane khate main daaleen
 The coalition came to power and joined the BSP government
 mulaayam singh yadav mukhyamantri bane, do saal sarkaar bhi chali
 No more than Mayawati was seen and on 1 June 1995 she started preparing to withdraw support from the Mulayam government
 is baat kii bhanak mulaayam singh ko lag gai or uske baad hi 2 june ko lakhanu main guest house cond hua, jisamen sapa ke kai vidhayakon or netaaon ne mayawati ko gher liya tha
 After this, the way of SP-BSP got separated
 bijepi se milakar sarkaar banaai phir tod diyaguest house cond ke baad mulaayam singh yadav se naata todane ke ek din baad hi 3 june 1995 ko mayawati ne bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banaai or mukhyamantri bani
 While CM with the help of BJP, Mayawati publicly attacked BJP leader former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh
 mayawati ke lagaataar jari hamalon ke bich bijepi ne basapa sarkaar se 17 oktober 1995 ko samarthan waapas le liya
 After this, President's rule was imposed in the province
 1996 main basapa-congress gathbandhansapa or bijepi ke baad basapa ne congress ke saath dosti kaa haath badhaayaa
 In the 1996 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, BSP and Congress joined the electoral arena, but the coalition did not get any special benefit
 basapa 300 siton par ladakar 66 or congress 125 siton par ladakar 33 siten jeetne main safal rahi
 Interestingly, the government could not form a government due to the absence of a majority of any party in the state and President's rule was imposed
 mayawati ne us vakt congress par aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki isse koi phayda nahin mila or gathbandhan tod liya
 In 1997, Hathmayavati again joined hands with BJP, joined hands again with BJP in 1997 after two years
 iske liye donon partiyon ke bich 6-6 maheene ke siem formule par sahmati bani
 Mayawati became the first Chief Minister and resigned her post after completing her six-month term and Kalyan Singh became the Chief Minister
 mayawati ne kalyaan singh ko ek maheene bhi dhang se kaam nahin karne diya
 Describing Kalyan Singh as anti-dalit, he launched a campaign against him
 10 oktober 1997 ko basapa ne kalyaan singh sarkaar se sarmathan waapas le liya
 However, Kalyan Singh had saved his government by proving majority in the house by breaking many mlas of BSP, Congress and Janata Dal
 1999 main centre main atal sarkaar ko gira diya tha1998 main centre main bani bijepi sarkaar par 13 maheene ke baad 1999 main sankat aa gai thi
 During this, the BSP promised the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he would support the government during the motion of confidence
 sadan main jab vishwaas prastaav par charchaa shuru hui or mayawati jaise hi bolne ke liye khadi huin, unhone kaha ki wo sarkaar ke samarthan main nahin hai
 After this, the BJP government fell
 2002 main todaa bijepi se nathautar pradesh main 2002 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila
 After this, both the BSP and BJP parties agreed to form a government on the two-and-a-half-year CM formula
 mayawati mukhyamantri baniin or 1 saal 117 din kii sarkaar chalaane ke baad unhone istipha de diya, jisase bijepi ko tagada jhatka laga
 In this way, the alliance with the BJP once again broke down
 iske baad sapa adhyaksh mulaayam singh basapa ke vidhayakon ko todakar sarkaar banane main safal rahe
 In 2018, the BSP-JDS alliance in Karnataka, the BSP stepped in to follow the coalition formulas in 2018
 karnataka main basapa ne jedies ke saath milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or ek vidhayak jeetne main safal rahi
 The results of the Karnataka Legislative Election came on 22 May 2018, the Congress and JDS coalition took power and HD Kumaraswamy became the Chief Minister, while the BSP also joined the government, the lone MLA was made the Minister
 kumaraswami kii shapath grahan main sonia gandhi or mayawati ke vyavhaar main itani najdiki dekhakar mana ja rahaa tha ki basapa madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main congress ke saath gathbandhan karke chunaav ladegi, donon dalon ke bich baat chal rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Mayawati announced not to ally with the Congress in the three states and got the resignation of her minister from the Karnataka government
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan 144 din chalalokasabhaa chunaav main basapa ne sapa ke saath milakar uttar pradesh main chunaav ladaa
 In January, the coalition announced the seat sharing formula
 basapa 38 or sapa 37 seat par ladi
 The rest of the seat went to rld's account
 chunaav ke nattejey jaise donon partiyon ne sochaa tha vaise nahin rahe
 BSP got 10 seats and SP got 5 seats
 aakhirkaar mayawati ne akhilesh yadav par sawaal uthaate hue gathbandhan tod diya

 Wrestler Sushil Kumar, who is fighting a legal battle for participation in the Rio Olympics, has not been relieved by the Delhi High Court
 court ne kaha ki vah federation ke faisle main dakhal nahin degaa
 After hearing the verdict of the court, Sushil Kumar's lawyer told the court that he should be allowed to withdraw his petition but the court said that now the order has been signed and hence the petition can not be returned
 daleelein sunne ke baad court ne kaha, 'susheel mahaan khiladihai, lekin raceling federation ke is tark ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa ki narsingh yadav behatar form main hai or unhen olympic main bhejne kaa faisla sahi he
 Sushil Kumar had alleged that Sushil Kumar had petitioned that both should be fought before going to the Olympics with Narasimha Yadav, who was selected for Rio Olympics
 susheel kaa aarope tha ki raceling federation ne bhedbhaav se narsingh yadav ko select kiya he
 After Monday's order of the Delhi High Court, it was clear who will go for the Rio Olympics between wrestlers Sushil Kumar and Narsingh Yadav
 susheel ne bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath nahin kii thi practispichley 2 hafte ke dauraan chali sunwaayee main is trial ke daavedaar ke taur par susheel or narsingh ne court main bhi majbootee ke apana paksh rakhaa
 During the hearing, when the court was annoyed by the wrong information given in the affidavit of Raj Singh, the Vice President of the Wrestling Federation, it was also revealed that Sushil, who went to Georgia at the expense of the Government of India, did not practice with the Indian players
 ve vahaan georgia ke khilaadiyon ke saath practice kar rahe the jo niyamon ke khilaaf he
 High Court expressed displeasure The High Court also appeared angry that the politics of the Wrestling Federation and sportspersons were being dragged into the court

 Sushil's lawyer told the court that there are more chances of Sushil being successful in international wrestling
 wo akelaa bhartiya resler he jisnegold medal bharat ke liye jeetaahai
 Narsingh does not have the experience that Sushil has, so if Sushil is sent to the Rio Olympics, India's chances of winning will increase
 susheel ke vakil ne federation ko gherawakil ne yah bhi kaha ki raceling federation ke niyamon ke hisaab se bhi 1 maheene pehle trial jaruri he
 The trial was conducted 13 months ago, which has no validity
 susheel kumaar ko olympic se dur kaise rakhaa ja saktaa he, agar usne kisi privet championships main bhaag lene se manaa kar diya he to ye olympic main jagah banane kii shart nahin ho sakati

 She is one of the 100 most powerful women in the world
 isiaisiai bank kii prabandh nideshak or siio chanda kochar ko pichley teen saal kii tarah is saal bhi duniya kii 100 sabase taqatvar mahilaon main chunaa gaya he
 Everyone knows her as a successful working woman but few people know about her personal life
 jahaan wo ek maa, ek beti, ek patni, ek bahu kii bhoomika main hoti hai
 It is generally believed that working women are unable to pay full attention to their children, but reading this letter of Chanda Kochhar will change your opinion too
 ye chitthee unhone apni beti aarti ke naam likhi he
 His letter has been published in the book "legacy: Letters from Eminent Parents to Their Daughters" written by Sudha Menon, which you will not be able to live without getting emotional after reading it
 pyaari aarti,aaj tumhen jivan ke is nae safar ke liye taiyaar or aatmavishvaas se bhari hui yuvati ke rup main dekhakar mujhe garv ho rahaa he
 i want to see you progress in the coming years
 aaj tumhen dekhakar meri apni yaaden jinda ho uthi hai
 All those things along with memories, the lessons that i learned in my childhood
 us vakt ke bare main sochati hum to paati hum ki zyaadaatar baaten or sabak to maine apane mata-pita se hi siikhe the
 i stand today on the foundation of the values they taught me in childhood
 ham teenon bhai-bahanon main kabhi bhedbhaav nahin kiya gaya
 Whether it is about education or future plans, there is no difference
 unhone hameshaa yahi kaha ki jis cheez se hamen santushti milti he, hamen usee disha main puri lagan se kaam karnaa chahie
 These things taught in childhood enabled us to take our own decisions
 is ek sabak ne mujhe khud kii pahchaan banane or khud ko talashne main madad kii
 i was just 13 when our father suddenly had a heart attack and left us alone
 unke rahane tak hamane kabhi bhi chunautiyon kaa saamana nahin kiya tha
 But after that night, everything changed without any prior notice
 meri maa, jo ab tak ek gruhinee thi, uske upar teen bacchon ko akele bada karne kii jimmedaari aa gai
 Then we came to know how strong she was
 dhire-dhire unhone textile digining ke liye khud ko taiyaar kiya or choti si form main naukari kar lee
 In a few days, he made himself a relevant person
 akele puure parivaar kii jimmedaari uthaanaa unke liye bahut mushkil rahaa hoga lekin unhone hamen kabhi bhi is baat kaa ehsaas nahin hone diya
 He worked hard until we all stood on our feet after completing college
 mujhe kabhi nahin pataa tha ki meri maa ko khud par itnaa bharosa he
 If you are a mother or father doing fulltime jobs, then your work should not affect your family and relationships
 wo vakt yaad he, jab tum america main pard rahi thi or mere isiaisiai bank ke emdi or siio banane kii khabaren saare akhabaaron main thim? tumne do din baad mujhe ek mail kiya jisamen tumne mujhe likhaa tha, ‘aapane hamen kabhi mahasoos nahin hone diya ki aapkaa kariyar itnaa tanavbhara or itnaa shandaar ho saktaa he
 You were just our mother at home, 'you live your life like that
 maa se maine ek baat or sikhi thi ki mushkilon se nipatakar aage badhate rahane kii takat hona sabase jaruri he, phir chaahe kuch bhi ho
 i still remember how patiently he handled everything after Papa's departure
 aapako sari mushkilon kaa saamana kar, unase jeetna hota he, na ki unhen khud par haaavee hone dena
 i remember how difficult it was to protect ICICI Bank during the global economic meltdown in late 2008
 saare bade media house dur se hamaari sthiti ko dekhakar andaaje laga rahe the, har jagah hamaare bare main bahasein kii ja rahi thim
 i got involved in work, from small to small depositors to big investors, i talked the most
 regulators se lekar sarkaar tak se baat kii
 The bank was not in trouble, but i also understood the problem of the stakeholders, because many feared that their money was in danger
 maine har branch ke staff ko salaah di ki bank se paisa nikaalane aae har invester kii baat tasalli se sunen
 If someone is waiting for their turn, give them a chair to sit and drink water and yes, even though people had complete freedom to withdraw their money from the bank, our staff explained to them that doing so would benefit them Will not happen, because in reality there was nothing about Crisis
 unheen mushkil dinon kii baat he, jab ek din maine tumhaare bhai ke squash toornament ke liye do ghante kii chuttee lee thi
 i had no idea at that time, but the bank's customers' trust in us was strengthened by my being there that day
 kuch maanon ne mere paas aakar poocha ki kya main isiaisiai kii chanda kochar hum, or jab maine haa main jawaab diya, to unka aglaa sawaal tha ki itane chrysis ke dauraan khel ke liye vakt kaise nikaala? unhen bharosa ho gaya tha ki agar main khel ke liye vakt nikaal rahi hum, to bank sahi haathon main he or apane paise ko lekar unhen darane kii jarurat nahin he
 i also learned to adapt to my mother according to the circumstances
 apane kariyar ke liye kadi mehnat karte vakt maine apane parivaar kii dekhbhaal bhi kii
 Whenever my mother and my in-laws needed me, i was with them
 unhone bhi meraa saath diya or mere kariyar ko aage le jane main meri madad kii
 Remember, relationships are very important and we should take care of them
 ye bhi yaad rakho ki rishte ekatarfa nahin hote, isliye jo aap apane saamne vaale se ummid rakhte ho, wo use dene ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Where my career is today, i would never have reached it if your father was not with me
 unhone ghar se baahar rahane par mujhase kabhi bhi shikaayat nahin kii
 Both of us were busy in our careers but still both of us did not let our relationship weaken
 mujhe bharosa he ki vakt aane par tum bhi apane partner ke saath vaisaa hi karogi
 If you had also complained about my being out of my house for a long time, i would never have dared to make a career for myself
 meraa saubhaahgya he ki mujhe itnaa samajhadaar or saath dene vaala parivaar mila he
 i am sure that when you make your family, you will be equally lucky
 mujhe yaad he, jab tumhaare board exam shuru hone vaale the
 i took leave so that i could take you to the exam for myself
 tab tumne mujhe bataaya ki kitne saal tak tumhen akele exam dene janaa padaa tha
 i was very sad to hear this
 par mujhe ye bhi laga ki ek kaamkaaji maa kii beti hone kii vajah se tum bahut jaldi hi aatmanirbhar ho gai ho
 You were not only sensible, but you also took care of your younger brother
 tumne use kabhi meri kami mahasoos nahin hone di
 i also learned to trust you, trust in you and now you have become a strong, self-sufficient woman
 main ab vahi siddhant apni company main bhi apanaati hum
 i believe in luck but at the same time i also believe that hard work has a very important role in our life
 bade myanon main dekhen to ham sab apni kismat khud hi likhte hai
 Take your luck in your hands, see the dream of what you want to achieve and write it according to yourself
 aage badhate vakt kai baar tumhen mushkil faisle lene honge
 Decisions that others may not like, but you should have enough courage to stand up for that in which you have faith
 dhyaan rahe ki tumme wo karne kii himmat honi chahie, jo tumhen sahi lagata he
 Aarti, anything can be achieved with strong will power, not its limits, but do not compromise your honesty and values while going behind your goal
 apane aas-paas ke logon kii bhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karnaa
 Remember that both good and bad time are equal in life
 tumhen ise ek hi tarah se lenaa siikhnaa hoga
 Take full advantage of the opportunity that life gives and keep learning from every opportunity, every challenge

 Unrecognized Bihar Cricket Association secretary Aditya Verma has made a new disclosure this time about Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 unke mutabik dhoni ne captaini chodi nahin balki unhen unase chhudvaai gai he
 According to Verma, Dhoni was pressurized, leaving him captaincy
 aditya verma is sabake peeche bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke jwoint secretary amitabh choudhary ko vajah bataa rahe hai
 According to Aditya Verma, Chaudhary had asked Dhoni to play the semi-finals for Jharkhand but since Mahi had already retired from this format, he refused it and joined the team as a mentor
 verma ke anusaar, jharkhand ke gujarat ke haathon semifinal haarate hi amitabh ne mukhya chayankarta emesake prasad ko phone kar dhoni ke bhavishya ke bare main poochne ko kaha or aisa hote hi dhoni ne captaini se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di

 verma se NDTV ne phone par baatcheet kii jisamen unhone in sabhi baton ke sach hone kaa daawa kiya
 According to Aditya Verma, everyone knows about the relationship of Amitabh Chaudhary and Dhoni in the entire Jharkhand cricket
 jab NDTV ne jharkhand cricket sangh ke purv adhyaksh amitabh choudhary ko phone lagaaya to unhone uskaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Amitabh Chaudhary did not even reply to the message made to him
 aapako bataa den ki mukhya chayankarta emesake prasad ne captaini chhodane ko puri tarah se mahendra singh dhoni kaa faisalaa bataaya tha
 Prasad had earlier also told Dhoni to decide on his captaincy himself

 He had also informed the BCCI about this

 unke netritv main bhartiya team ne nai bulandiyon ko chuaa, bhartiya cricket ke svarnim itihaas main unka naam hameshaa darj ho gaya he'
 Aditya Verma is giving the reason behind this to Amitabh Chaudhary, Joint Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 aditya verma ke mutabik, choudhary ne dhoni se jharkhand ke liye semifinal khilne ke liye kaha tha lekin chunki maahi pehle hi is formet se sanyas le chuke hai isliye unhone isse inkaar kar diya or team ke saath mentor ke taur par jud gaye
 According to Verma, after losing the semi-final to Gujarat in Jharkhand, Amitabh phoned the chief selector MSK Prasad to ask him about Dhoni's future and Dhoni announced his retirement from the captaincy

 vitt varsh 2018 main railway kaa oparating reshio 98
 This ratio reached 98% in FY 2001, before reaching 44%
 3 fisadi par thabite kuch dinon se bhartiya railway ko lekar niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) kii ek report charchaa main he

 taaja report ke mutabik railway kaa oparating reshio yani parichaalan anupaat vitt varsh 2018 main 98
 Has reached 44 percent
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki vitt varsh 2017-18 main railway ne 100 rupee kii kamai ke liye 98 rupee 44 paise kharch kar die
 That is, the railways made a profit of only 1 rupee 56 paise during this period
 agar ateet ke aankadon par gaur karen to railway kaa oparating reshio yani parichaalan anupaat utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa he
 But the increase in the operating ratio of railways in FY 2018 is probably the worst
 isse pehle vitt varsh 2001 main oparating reshio 98
 Was at 3 per cent

 Today, the Chief Minister of Delhi, the Congress made him a hero, then today JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar made the politics of BJP a hero
 donon kii muhim 'aazaadee' he or lakshya aam aadmi kaa vikaas
 Come, let us know why Kejriwal and Kanhaiya-1 are similar to each other in these eight points
 congress or bijepi kaa conection-- arvind kejariwal dilli se lekar desh ke har kone main charchit hue or ek prabhavi rajaneta ke taur par ubhare
 Congress is somewhere for Kejriwal to enter politics
 dilli main congress kii nitiyon ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaale kejariwal ko desh kii janata ne haathon-haath liya
 - Kanhaiya Kumar made the issue of increasing interference of RSS and BJP inside JNU
 haal hi main kathith rashtravirohi kaarykram main kanhaiya kaa naam saamne laane main bijepi or uske chaatr sanghathan abivipi kaa haath he
 2
 donon andolanon ke jariye hero bane-- arvind kejariwal ko anna hajaare ke janalokapal andolan ne ubhaara
 Kanhaiya Kumar: Nationalism and anti-nationalism in KJNU made hero
 3
 Kejriwal had also said the same - Kejriwal had said this about the question of entering politics almost at the time of Anna movement that he has not come to do politics
 vah raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara se nahin judenge
 However, he later split from Anna and formed a party
 - kanhaiya kumaar ne bhi jail se reeha hone ke baad apane pehle bhaashan main hi kaha ki vah netaa nahin bananaa chaahate
 He wants to become a teacher
 haalanki jeenyu vivaad ne unki raajnneetik raah aasaan kar di he
 4
 aazaadee kii muhim se donon charchaa main aae--kejariwal ne anna ke saath milakar desh se bhrashtachar mitaane or bhrashtachar se aazaadee dilaane kii muhim chhedi tha or dilli kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad bhi vah lagaataar apni is baat ko doharaate rahe hai
 Kanhaiya Kumar has said that he wants freedom not in the country but in the country
 vah desh ko garibi, bhukhmaree, bhedbhaav se aazaadee dilaanaa chaahate hai
 5
 janata kii ladaai lekar aage bade--arvind kejarivalane aam aadmi ke haq kii ladaai kaa naaraa dekar raajnneeti main entry lee
 Kanhaiya Kumar said that he is fighting the battle of common students and wants everyone to read and move forward like them
 6
 Both went to Tihar Jail - Arvind Kejriwal was sent to Tihar Jail in judicial custody in May 2014 by the Patiala House Court in a defamation case of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari
 - kanhaiya kumaar ko 9 farvari ko jeenyu main hui kathith deshvirohi ghatana main shaamil rahane ke aarope main patiala house court ne hi nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bheja tha
 Kanhaiya is currently released on interim bail
 7
 Identity of simplicity - Kejriwal has been very much discussed for his simplicity
 kejariwal kaa dress code bhi unki pahchaan ban chukaa he
 - The simplicity of Kanhaiya is also in front of the people
 chaatr sangh adhyaksh banane ke baad bhi unamem tamaam chaatr netaaon jaisaa rob nahin aayaa
 8
 philhal donon bijepi ke khilaaf- dilli main dobaaraa satta paanaa ho yaa phir 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav, kejariwal kii ladaai congress se hatakar bijepi par aa gai
 Kejriwal and bjp's fight on all administrative issues in the country's capital has also come to the fore
 - kanhaiya kii ladaai bhi jeenyu menkathith rashtravirohi gatividhiko mudda banane vaali bijepi ke khilaaf hi he
 Even after being released from jail, Kanhaiya's talk has clearly shown anger against RSS and BJP
 beete 9 farvari ko dilli sthit jeenyu campus main kathith desh virdohi narebaaji ke baad se Anti National (raashtra virdohi) or Sedition (rajdroh) shabd khub charchaa main he
 In this case, along with the president of JNU Students' Union, Kanhaiya Kumar, a case is also going on in this regard against some other students
 lekin in sab ke bich takanic kii duvidha yah he ki yadi aap Google Maps par Anti National or Sedition search karte hai to yah aapako jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity kaa nakshaa dikh rahaa he
 Significantly, Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested by Delhi Police for organizing the program on Afzal Guru and for anti-national slogans
 unke alaava anirbaan bhattacharya or umr khalid naam ke chaatro kii bhi giraftaar hui thi
 All of them are under sedition or sedition case and all three are out on bail
 is puure maamle main in chaatro ko desh ke bade tabake ne 'anti neshnal' yani 'deshadrohi' qaraar diya or inaki aalochana kii
 Along with social media, there was a debate on this topic in the entire country, while now searching on National Maps (sedition) and Sedition (treason) in Google Maps, the map of JNU is visible

 court ne itnaa tak kah diya ki agar is maamle main chunaav ayog koi thos hal nahin nikaal saktaa to phir court hi apana faisla sunayega
 The court has given four weeks time to the Election Commission in this case and asked to file an answer in the entire case

 This is a strange case of the death of a student of a famous fashion designing institute in Pune, which has surprised everyone, including medical science experts as well as the raging policemen
 pune ke simboysis institute se fishan dizining kaa course karanevaali sanam kii ye khushi tab dohari ho jaati he, jab use janmdin kii mubaarakabaad dene uske mata-pita khud mumbai se chalakar pune pahunchate hai
 First there is a small party in the house and after this Sanam's friends announce a surprise party for her
 is sarprise party ke bare main ghar ke log bhi anjaan hai, lekin beti kii khushi or doston kii jid ke aage haar kar uske mata-pita sanam ko nitout kii ijaajat de dete hai lekin uske baad subah hote-hote jo khabar hasan parivaar ko milti he, usase sabhi ke hosh ud jate hai
 On the phone, Sanam's friends inform her family members that Sanam's health is very bad and hence she is admitted to the hospital
 apni iklauti ladli ke achaanak yun biimaar hone kii khabar milte hi gharavaale sidhe pune ke rubi haul clinics main pahunchate hai, lekin yahaan duniya kii sabase manahuus khabar unka intjaar kar rahi he
 This is news, of Sanam's death
 chand ghante pehle tak bilkul hansatii-khelti, tandurust or khushmijaaj sanam ke saath aakhir achaanak aisa kya hua ki wo is tarah duniya se rukhsat ho gai
 This girl was very happy when she went to attend a surprise birthday party given by her friends
 wo der raat tak celibratt karti rahi or is dauraan kuch rishtedaaron se uski baatcheet bhi hui lekin subah suraj ke ugte-ugte uski jindagi kaa suraj dub chukaa tha
 He had died
 aakhir sanam ke maut kii vajah kya thi, kyonki jo ladki mahaj ek raat pehle tak apane berth de kii khushi main chahak rahi thi
 What happened to him overnight that suddenly he died
 ye sawaal hasan parivaar ko lagaataar pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 He inquired about this from Sanam's friends and the hospital as well, but whatever answers he received, they were not getting down
 sanam ke doston ne unhen bataaya ki raat ko achaanak uski tabiyat bighad gai or use ultiyaan hone lageen or tab unhone sanam ko rubi haul clinics main laakar bharti karvaa diya, lekin sawaal ye tha ki agar raat ko party ke dauraan hi sanam kii tabiyat bighad gai thi, to tab uske doston ne iske bare main sanam ke maa-baap ko ittila kyon nahin di, jabaki hasan parivaar ke log tab pune main hi maujuud the
 The question was also why his friends got him admitted to the Ruby Hall Clinic away from the party venue, while there were many other hospitals nearby
 jaahir he, sanam ke gharavaalon in sawaalon kaa koi aisa jawaab nahin mil sakaa, jisase unki tasalli ho paati, lekin iske baad jo kuch hua, wo or bhi ajeeb tha
 Sanam's medical report from the hospital said that Sanam died due to heart attack due to excessive intoxication
 medical report main sanam ke dil main blockege hone kii baat bhi kahi gai thi
 That is, this report was pointing out that Sanam had a heart disease, but Sanam's family members were not ready to accept this because Sanam had no such medical history and secondly that she was a sports girl
 lihaaja, use dil kii beemaari hone jaisi baat gharavaale maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 These things were just the beginning of questions like values
 gharavaalon ne jab aspataal ke records ko gaharaai se dekha, tab unhen pataa chalaa ki sanam ko aspataal main saadhe nau baje bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, lekin sanam kii isiji report par darj vakt ye bataa rahaa tha ki sanam kii isiji subah 8 bajkar 52 minute par karavaaya gaya
 That means 38 minutes before hospitalization, but how was it possible
 jaahir he, is maamle main kuch to aisa jarur tha, jo is maamle se jude kuch log chhipaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 At that time, with full heart, the Hassan family buried Sanam's corpse, but the post-mortem report that came after it turned the whole case over
 yaa phir yun kahen ki is report main darj baaten kaaman sens ke lihaaj se to dur medical science ke nazariye se saraasar naammumkin thi
 This riddle of Sanam's death was hidden in his post-mortem report because it was the post-mortem report, which completely reversed the entire case
 ye postmortem report hi thi, jo ye bataa rahi thi ki maut ke pehle tak ladki rahi sanam maut ke baad ladkaa ban chukaa tha
 But how was it possible? ye ek bhalee-changi ladki kii rahasyamayi maut kaa maamla tha
 Sanam's body was sent from Ruby Hall Hospital to Sasun Hospital for postmortem
 yahaan doctoron ne uskaa postmortem to kiya, lekin visra report aane tak apni raay surakshit rakh lee
 It is clear that the doctor would like to know that Sanam did not eat anything poisonous in the party that night
 doctoron ne uske jism ke kuch hisson ko visra jaanch ke liye surakshit rakh liya tha lekin iske kuch dinon baad jab visra report saamne ai, to maamle kii jaanch kar rahe pulisavaalon ke saath-saath tamaam log sakate main aa gaye
 In this report, along with all other things, a strange thing was written which was not possible in any case, nor had any such thing been heard in medical science before
 ye baat thi sanam ke seene main kisi purush yani mard kaa dil hone kii
 In the post-mortem report, Sanam's heart was described as the man's heart, but how was it possible
 ek ladki ke seene main kisi ladke kaa dil bhala kaise dhadak saktaa tha or bas, isi baat ne maut ke is maamle ko sulajhane kii bajaay kuch aise uljhaayaa ki dhakad pulisavaale kaa dimag bhi gum gaya
 These reports said that 70 percent of Sanam's heart was lying block
 yani dil main khun sahi tareeke se nahin daud rahaa tha
 Not only this, according to the report, in addition to a deep scar of about three centimeters in his chest, it was also written that he was given four injections
 jaahir he ki sanam kii visra report ye sabit karti he ki ise surakshit rakhe jane ke dauraan kuch aisa jarur hua jisaki badaulat visra badal gaya yaa phir badal diya gaya lekin agar yahi sach tha, to aisa karne ke peeche kya makasad he
 The question arises whether Sanam's death was not a common death
 kya uski jaan lee gai or kisi ne maamle ke uljhane ke liye visra badal diya
 Sanam's death has become a puzzle to which no one currently has an answer
 sabase bada sawaal to yahi he ki aakhir sanam kii laash kaa visra kaise badal gaya
 Is this just a coincidence or is there a deep conspiracy behind it
 ab is maamle main sanam ke gharavaalon ko yakeen ho chalaa tha ki sanam kii maut mahaj koi haadasa nahin he, balki uskaa katl kiya gaya he or ab badalte halaat main sanam ke gharavaalon kaa shaq police se lekar uske doston or yahaan tak aspataal ke logon par bhi hone laga tha
 In fact, during the birthday day party, at around 2
20 pm, his maternal uncle called him and congratulated him on his birthday
 jaahir he, tab tak sanam bilkul salaamat thi lekin subah jab chaar baje sanam kii mausi ne use berth de vish kaa massej bheja, to usne koi jawaab nahin diya
 That is, his health had deteriorated by then
 aise main sawaal ye tha ki phir tabhi uske doston ne ye baat uske gharavaalon ko kyon nahin bataai
 There was no one among his friends who conspired against Sanam and if he hatched, then what could have been the purpose of killing a girl like this
 sanam kaa visra to khayr badla hi ja chukaa tha
 But in order to crosscheck the case, the CID, which is investigating it, decided to get its DNA tested and the same thing was revealed in this effort, which had already been cleared
 visra kaa diene hasan dampatti se match nahin kar rahaa tha
 That is, Visra did not belong to Sanam
 thik isi tarah sanam ke jism ke duusare namoonon ke saath bhi visare kaa koi mail nahin tha or ye ek gahari sajeesh kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa tha
 The family members even say that Sasun, the father of one of Sanam's friends, works in the hospital, or else he has changed the viscera of Sanam with the intention of saving his son
 sanam ke gharavaalon pune police kii kahili se bhi khaase naaraaz hai
 However, despite nine months in the midst of all these questions, the death of this girl has remained a strange puzzle

 iske baad agency ne unhen doosraa saman jari kar 2 april pesh hone ko kaha tha
 'last summons sent to Mallya', government sources said, 'investigating officers posted in ed's Mumbai office issued fresh summons to the chief of United Breweries (UB) group on Saturday and asked them to appear in person on April 9
 
 ' adhikariyon ne sanket die ki yah maalya ko bheja gaya aakhri saman ho saktaa he, kyonki jaanch adhikari (aaio) ab tak takneekee or kanoonee aadhaar par unki peshi taalane kaa anurodh maanate rahe hai
 He said that under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), usually three summons are sent and it will be completed by the new date of next Saturday
 idi adhikariyon ne yah bhi kaha ki aaio ne may tak kii mohalat dene keemaalya kii arjikhrij kar di thi, kyonki unka jaanch main hissaa lenaa ahm he or isliye unhen sirf agle shanivaar tak kaa vakt diya gaya he
 Mallya's passport can be canceled
 Mallya informed IO on Friday that the bank loan cases are still pending in the Supreme Court and with the help of his legal and corporate team, he is trying to repay these debts
 Therefore, they will need some more time
 sutron ne bataaya ki yadi maalya nau april ko bhi pesh nahin hote hai to pravartan nideshaalay unka passport radd karne ke liye kanoonee kadam uthaa saktaa he or kisi adaalat se unke khilaaf gaiyr-jamaanti warrant bhi jari karvaa saktaa he
 Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines Ltd (KFA) in a sealed envelope on 30 March had said in a proposal submitted to the Supreme Court that they would repay the debt of Rs 4,000 crore by September this year out of a total loan of Rs 6,903 crore

 Even those who bought houses from Amrapali knew how the company was fudging! Mismanagement of government companies is not our only problem
 bharat ab chamakate brand or companiyon kaa kabristaan ban rahaa he
 Satyam, ADAG (anil Ambani Group), Videocon, Sahara, Modiluft, Rotomac, Jaypee Group, Nirav Modi, Gitanjali Gems, Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Unitech, Amrapali, IL&FS, Sterling Biotech, Bhushan Steel
 
 
 yah suchi khaasi lambii ho sakati he
 
 
 We will suddenly realize that the private promoters of India are far more soul-mongering after the Tata, Fortis and Infosys boards add to the losses or share price losses in Café Coffee Day
 kisi company ke prabandhan yaa kharaab korporate gavarnence se hamen fark kyon nahin padataa? companiyon kaa bura prabandhan, kisi kharaab sarkaar jitna hi ghaatak he
 The government can still be changed but it is impossible to change the management of companies
 bharat main kharaab korporate gavarnence se jitani badi companiyaan dubi hai, yaa pravartakon ke dambh or galatiyon ne jitani samruddhi kaa vinaash (velth distroction) kiya he vah mandi se hone vaale nuksaan kii tulana main kamatar nahin he
 Actually, this is triple destruction
 ek—share niveshak apni puunji ganvaate hai
 For example, till a few years ago, shares of big companies (rcom, Videocon, Unitech, Vodafone, Suzlon) are now getting one rupee
 do—inamen bainkon kii puunji (pienbi-neerav modi) duubati he jo darasal aam logon kii bachat he auratisraa—achaanak fatne vaali bekaari jaise jet airways, arcom, uninor
 Despite the strictest rules on corporate governance in the country, the rules of running a company, there has been a spate of scams
 companiyon ke nideshak mandalon ke kaamkaaj sire se apaardarshee hai
 The onus of fixing them is on the promoters, on whom the board speaks
 indigo yaa fortis main vivaad ke baad hi in companiyon main korporate gavarnence kii kalai khuli
 The board of Tata Sons removed Cyrus Mistry a few months after he was named the brilliant chairman
 infosis kaa nideshak mandal, kabhi vishaal sikaa to kabhi purv pravartak narayanamurthi kaa samarthak bana or is dauraan niveshkon ne gahari chot khai
 Chanda Kochhar remained in ICICI even after the loan was wrongly given to Videocon
 yes bank ke emdi siio rana kapur ko hataanaa padaa yaa ki ielandeeyes ne asankhya sabsidiari ke jariye paisa ghumaya or board sota rahaa
 There are many more
 companiyon par pravartakon ke kabje ke kaaran swatantra nideshak naakaara ho jate hai, niamak oonghtey rahete hai, kisi kii javabdehi nahin tay ho paati or achaanak ek din company itihaas ban jaati he
 Promoters of Indian companies are becoming notorious for misuse of money and bank loans
 amrapali ke forencik audit se hi yah pataa chalaa ki maalikon ne chaparasi or nichle karmchaariyon ke naam se 27 se zyada companiyaan banaai, jinka istemaal herapheri ke liye hota tha
 Powerful promoters, together with banks, rating agencies, and audits, form a cartel that is visible only when the company defaults or sinks in debt, as it did at IL&FS
 pravartakon ke dambh or galat faislon se hue nuksaan kii suchi (jaise tata naino, kingfisher) bhi lambii he
 In the greed to grow up as soon as possible, Indian entrepreneurs get into such industries where they have no experience or need, with the help of loans and clout
 makaan banaate-banaate amrapali film banane lagi or anil ambani samooh vittiya sevaayen chalaate-chalaate rafel kii marammat kaa kaam lene lage
 Western companies stay in the same business for a long time and provide better returns and services to investors and consumers, while 80 percent of India's 'great' companies fall to average levels in a very short period of time by losing returns on capital or getting stuck in debt
 companiyon main kharaab gavarnence se sarkarein kyon phikrmand hone lageen? unhen to inase milane vaale tex yaa chunavi chande se matlab he
 The promoters have nothing at stake
 duubate to hai rojgaar or bainkon kaa karj
 Competition in the market dies
 jaahir he ki is nuksaan se kisi netaa kii sehat par koi fark nahin padataa
 Inefficient government can be changed in five years, but it is impossible to change the managers of inefficient companies

 Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Lalu Yadav has broken the silence over the Central Bureau of Investigation's CBI raid
 chaara ghotaale main ranchi court main shuukravaar kii subah peshi ke baad baahar nikle lalu ne sibiai chhapemari ko raajnneetik sajeesh qaraar diya
 Narendra Modi will take away the power! RJD leader said that i have nothing to do with this

 Everything happened during the NDA era
 main ranchi main hum, meraa parivaar patna main or chaape chal rahe hai
 This is a conspiracy between BJP and RSS

 The condition of the country is worse

 The open tender of IRCTC, which started in 2006, said that rules have been followed throughout the episode
 1999 main iarsitisi kaa gathan hua
 Work commenced in 2002 and in 2003 the Railways handed over the hotel-passenger residence to IRCTC
 2006 main iarsitisi ne open tender shuru kiya
 Lalu said that it is not the fault of the CBI, it is Narendra Modi and Amit Shah who are sitting at the center and giving directions to the investigating agency
 rajd netaa ne kaha ki chhapemari kii karrwai kii jaankaree media ko bhi nahin he or sibiai ne red daal di or cese darj kar lee gai
 Lalu said - Not afraid of CBI, the fearless leader said that CBI raids have become habit now
 jaanch agency se main nahin darataa
 Our fight is against the arrogance of the central government
 lalu ne kaha ki ve jaanate hai ki lalu lagaataar majboot hote ja rahe hai or ye ladaai 2019 main unhen hataane ke liye he
 In his clarification, he said that IRCTC was formed in 1999 and Lalu was no minister then
 2002 main iarsiti kaam karne lagi
 Handover in the Vajpayee government: Laloo said that in 2003 the Delhi, Howrah, Ranchi Yatri Niwas IRCTC was handover and the Vajpayee government was in power at that time
 31 may 2004 ko lalu rail mantri bane or ye yatri nivas iarsitisi ko hand over kiye ja chuke the
 He said that under this policy in 2006, open tenders were taken out for repair and maintenance of some hotels

 jin logon ko kuch mashhoor hastiyon kii nijee zindagi main jhaankne kaa shauk rahata he, unhen bhi 'bedaad-e-ishq : rudaad-e-shaadi' naam kii is kitaab ko padhanaa chahie
 When you first meet, then what happened, who proposed and where did you go on a honeymoon, it is a pinch to get into the married life through all these fixed questions
 jaise aap kisi objective sawaalon ke aage tik kiye ja rahe hon, yah sochate hue ki kuch to tukke main bhi sahi ho hi jayega
 Reading this book is like going through all the ups and downs of love marriages
 jahaan pehali baar milanaa or prapos karne kii romaaniat kii jagah zindagi kaa vah cheharaa nazar aane lagata he, jo ek baar daraa bhi detaa he ki kalejaa nahin he to ishq mat kiijie
 bedad-e-ishq: Not a book, ruadad-e-shaadi, is a document in which many people have recorded their own troubled stories from the making of their love stories to the break up
 apane prem ko khud kii nazar se dekhnaa or use duniya bhar ke pathakon ke liye likhnaa utana hi mushkil rahaa hoga, jitna pehali baar apni maa yaa pita ko bataanaa ki mujhe yah ladkaa acha lagata he yaa yah ladki acchhee lagati he
 Surely some people have written their story in a cursory manner, but some have written the story so firmly that reading from it is like torturing themselves
 aisa ksht jisase ham sab bhaagna chaahate hai
 Even though every incident of their love story is not mentioned, they have sincerely told how much everything keeps happening within love
 jo log is vakt prem main hai yaa jo kisi bhi vakt prem main ho sakate hai unhen yah kitaab padhani chahie
 'when both of us, including our comrade friends, raised slogans of casteist Murdabad, something was stirring within us
 
 
 aisa laga jaise hamaari kalpanaaon kaa vah samaaj saakaar hone ja rahaa tha, jise banane ke liye ham patibaddh hai
 When we choose our partner, we become the opposition to the society
 aise main hamaara parivaar bhi samaaj kaa hi saath detaa he
 ' vibhavari or priyanvad kii prem kahani main gorakhpur vaaya elahabaad hote hue jeenyu ke campus tak ek ladki ko bahari spes to miltaa he, lekin vibhavari apane ghar ke bheetar jab us spes kii talash karti hai jo ek dalit ladki apane mata-pita se ek brahman ladke se shaadi kii ladaai ladane lagati he
 You read the love story of both from the perspective of Vibhavari, because Priyamvad has not written his story
 vibhavari bataa bhi detii hai ki unki kahani ekatarfa he
 It is astonishing to see how society uses all its forces against love
 vibhavari or priyanvad kii prem yatra main samaaj se sangharsh to he lekin vyaktigat jivan main ek behatar saamanjasy bhi he, jise dekhakar bahut log prem vivaah ke liye protsaahit ho sakate hai
 But without going through this process, you can never understand the forces of society that you want to change
 'kehane ko prem bhi kiya or jisase prem kiya usee se vivaah bhi kiya, usee prem ke liye ghar se bhaag kar gai or aakhir ek din us prem se bhi bhaag ai
 But what was this repeated run away from? ' devayani bharadwaj or shiv kii kahani main aap bikaner se jaipur nahin aate, balki kavita rachate rachate is jode ke bich se ek din kavita hi gaayab ho jaati he
 When he fights with the whole world and settles in his home, he trusts the person who is home
 kismen pataa nahin, lekin shiv yah bataanaa bhi zaruri nahin samajhataa or ek din devayani or unke do beton kii duniya se alag ho jaataa he
 Devyani writes about Shiva's dignity without hurting her, but this story cannot be complete without Shiva's favor
 bedaad-e-ishq : rudaad-e-shaadi kii prem kahaniyaan communist pariwaron ke dhakoslepan se lekar un pariwaron ke jatigat ahankaar ko kholti hai jo khud duusari jatiyon ke kaaran haashiye par dhakele jane kii shikaar rahi hai
 Some stories are of comrades
 aap un kahaniyon se guzarate hue vichaardhaara or samaajadhaara kii ulajhanon main jhaank sakenge
 Devayani loses everyone in love, who finds some good friends in the meantime
 behad jokhim kaa kaam he is samaaj main prem karnaa
 Even more difficult is to write through it
 devayani ke liye pathar ke neeche dabane jaisaa rahaa hoga apni is kahani ko dabane se bachi rah gayi ungaliyon se likhnaa
 There is a filmy touch in the story of Naveen and Poonam, but how much Poonam's obsession with loving Poonam has been transformed by Naveen
 punam waapas main zindagi main ai to naveen use nai zindagi dene laga
 But Naveen, who believes the Jat family's excesses to be natural, could never see the contradictions within him if Sandhya's Brahmin father had not cleverly said that i am afraid of the Jat people
 ve ladakiyon ko maarthe hai
 Give your father's phone number, i will talk to him
 naveen yaheen se apane bheetar jhaankne lagata he
 Sometime the Poonam starts peeping inside Naveen

 From Valentine's Day to Archie Card and film songs, it is important to save the love stories
 taaki ham sirf kisi ko pyaar hi na karen yaa kisi se pyaar kiye jane kii chahat hi na rakhen, balki ek behatar premi bhi ban saken
 But this book should be read by more than lovers who crush such love stories as a society
 shaayad yah kitaab unke liye hai
 If you have any kind of guilt while reading this book, then forgive the authors
 unhen pataa nahin he ki aap bhi vaise hi hai

 The second appeal is, 'increase the CPI-M and the Left's numbers for an alternative policy
 ’ or teesri apil he ‘desh main dharmanirpeksh sarkaar banaao
 Karat said that through these slogans, 'this time Modi unemployed' slogan will be the core of the election campaign to get rid of the problems of communal bigotry, farmer crisis and unemployment in the last five years

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii adhyakshata main rajg-2 sarkaar kii nayi mantriparishad kii pehali baithak main aaj bihar vidhansabha ke satr, nayi sarkaar kii praathamiktaaon or asthaayee adhyaksh ke chunaav ke sambandh main nirnay kiya gaya
 After the Cabinet meeting, Principal Secretary of the State Cabinet and Coordination Department Afzal Amanullah told reporters here, 'discussion regarding convening session of Bihar Assembly in first meeting of Council of Ministers of NDA Government, election of temporary Speaker and administering oath to newly elected mlas
 Occurred and decided
 ’unhone kaha ki aath baar vidhayak rah chuke varisht congress netaa sadanand singh 30 november se do disambar tak navnirvaachit vidhayakon ko shapath dilaayenge
 The new assembly speaker will be elected on December 2
 pakistan kaa sabase bada chhalaava, pakistan kaa sabase bada bhoot or pakistan ko sabase zyada khun ke aansu rulaane vaala taharik-e-taliban pakistan kaa sargana mullah fajalullah urf mullah radio shaayad maaraa gaya
 Probably because there have been reports of this deceit being killed many times before
 magar pakistani media reports ke mutabik is baar wo sachmuch hi maaraa gaya he
 Terrorists killed in drone attack: If you believe the Pakistani media, then Pakistan's five crore prize terrorist and the biggest leader of the tehreek-e-taliban in Swat, Maulana Fazlullah was killed inside his house in a drone attack in Afghanistan on Monday night
 
 report ke mutabik uske ghar kii pukhta jaankaree milane ke baad hi hamalaa kiya gaya or us hamale main wo maaraa gaya
 However, there has been no response from the tehreek-e-taliban regarding the news of Mulla's death and neither is the Government of Pakistan confirming it yet
 pakistani suraksha adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki somvaar raat ko taharik-e-taliban pakistan chif mullah fajalullah kii maut ko lekar khabar to ai he
 But now we are looking for evidence related to his death
 kai baar aa chuki he marane kii khabargauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi talibani chif ke maare jane kii khabaren aati rahi hai, lekin wo sabhi khabaren juthi nikaleen
 In March last year, there were reports that Fazlullah was among those killed in air strikes in the Tirah Valley of Khyber Agency
 lekin uske baad titipi ne ise afvaah bataaya tha or kaha tha ki unka chif abhi jinda he
 Similarly, in June 2009, there was news of Fazlullah being killed
 lekin paak media kii maane to is baar shaayad fajalullah batch nahin paaya
 And the reason for this is the strict attitude of the Pak government after the Taliban attack on Bacha Khan University in Peshawar
 hamale ke baad se hi paak fouj or suraksha agenciyaan taharik-e-taliban pakistan ke khilaaf lagaataar hamale tej kiye hue hai
 The most dangerous terrorist of Pakistan was Mullah Fazlullah, the most dreaded face of terror in Radiapakistan, and the Taliban is killed by one of its gestures
 ye wo shaks he jisane pakistan kaa switsraland kahi jane vaali swat ghati ko naa sirf nark main tabdeel kar diya balki uske napak mansoobon ne kai baar pakistan ko khun ke aansu rulaayaa he
 Swat Valley of Pakistan
 behad hi khubasurat is ilaake ko fajalullah ne aatank kaa garh bana diya tha
 Every day his new fatwas created a fear of fear in the hearts of people that he started shivering in the name of Fazallulah
 yahaan har kisi ke chehre par fajallulaah kaa dar or khauf kaa saaf dikhaai detaa tha
 The women would leave the burqa from the house and the children were afraid of going to school
 fajalullah ne banaaya radio mullahpane sasur sufi mohammad ke saath milakar fajalullah ne swat ghati main aatank kii hukumat kabiz kar di
 On the day of his arrival on the radio Taliban played a disgusting game in the name of religion in the Swat Valley
 kabhi mahilaon ko ghar se nikalne kaa fatwa, kabhi bacchon ko skool naa bhejne kaa farmaan to kabhi sangeet sunne par maut kii sajaa dene kaa elaan
 Fazallulah's face became more dangerous with every decree
 jis kisi ne fajallulaah ke farmaanon kii andekhi karne kii jurrat kii to use mili maut kii sajaa
 So the women got the punishment of public whip
 jiske baad to kisi ne bhi fajallulaah ke saamne sir uthaane kii himmat nahin kii
 Fazal Hayat was a born gangster who massacred innocent children in a school in Peshawar
 Its head was Maulana Fazlullah alias Mulla Radio
 uskaa paidaaishi naam fazal hayaat tha
 Born in 1974 in Swat district of Pakistan, this Pashtun militant Deoband was a supporter of Sunni Islam and wanted to implement Sharia law in Pakistan
 behad kattar vichaardhaara kaa fajalullah usee samudaay se aata he jis samudaay se nobel prise vijeta malala yusufajai aati hai
 Fazlullah was arrested by the Pakistan government in 2005
 usne jail main hi rahakar tamaam dharmik kitaaben padhin
 It was from there that his fundamentalism began
 jail se chhootane ke baad usne pakistan kii sarkaar or kattarpathiyon ke bich samjhauta karavaaya jiske evaj main paak sarkaar ne use malcond jile main sharia kanoon lagu karne kii ijaajat de di
 After the military, Mullah gradually strengthened in the area of swat Valley
 baad main usne khoonkhaar aatanki batulla mahsood ke saath haath mila liya
 By 2007, it had formed an army of 4500 fighters and started ruling the 59 villages of the Swat Valley
 10 july 2009 ko pakistani fouj ke hamale main vah jakhmi to ho gaya lekin batch niklaa
 The army destroyed his madrasa costing crores of rupees
 fouj ke hamale ke baad hi vah afghanistan chalaa gaya or vahiin se oparation chalaane laga
 He used to attack Pakistani forces only while staying in Afghanistan
 sharia kanoon kaa tha himaytifjalullah shuru se hi kade sharia kanoon kaa himachati tha or unhen todane waalon ko kadi sajaa detaa tha
 These included even strangling to death
 vah sangeet, tivi, cinema vagairah kaa ghor virdohi tha or aisa karne waalon ko sajaa detaa he
 He set fire to all computer shops in Swat
 fajalullah khaas taur par muslim mahilaon kii talim or unke skool jane ke khilaaf tha
 He bombed ten girls' schools
 jabaki kareeb 170 skulon ko nestnabut kar diya tha
 Malala was attacked in 2012 at the behest of Mullah Fazlullah
 jab fajalullah ke naam kii tuuti bolaa karti thi tab police chhodie paak sena tak uske garh, khaas taur par uske hadquarter kaa rukh karne se ghabraati thi
 This was the same headquarters from where Fazlullah created all the dangerous conspiracies
 ye vahi adda tha jahanjalullaipane kaidiyon ko bandi banaakar unpar julm dhaha tha
 This was the same place where he would sit through mullah radio and issue all death orders
 yaheen thi taliban kii takatswat main moulana fajalullah kaa headquarter kisi kile se kam nahin tha
 Here was everything that should be at the center of any power
 talibani commander yaheen se aadesh lete the or usee kii talim karte the
 The final decision was also pronounced from here
 taliban kaa supreme court mullah radio ke headquarter se hi chalata tha
 The decision of this court was final, and that decision was applicable to all
 chaahe wo kabeelai janata ho yaa phir talibani ladaaku
 The Taliban's largest prison was also here
 sajayaftaa kaidiyon ko yaheen rakhaa jaataa tha
 Whether to inflict a whip on a prisoner or to punish a savage, there were all the arrangements in this prison
 kai kaidi taliban kii jyaadati ke shikaar hue
 There is no account of how many were killed
 taliban kaa bank bhi isi headquarter main tha
 The account of the money recovered from the people was kept here
 kise kitna paisa dena he kis oparation main kitna paisa janaa he sab-kuch yaheen tay hota tha
 Fazlullah himself used to decide the transaction of money
 swat nadi ke kinare tha headquarterimamderi headquarter ko 2004 main swat nadi ke kinare banaaya gaya tha
 It cost around 1 crore rupees
 ye paise logon ne daan ke taur par die the
 At that time, the area of swat River was chosen very thoughtfully
 ye ilaaka suraksha ke lahaaz se bhi kaaphi ahm tha
 From here it could be monitored far and wide
 prashasan ke khyaal se bhi isaki kaaphi ahmiyat thi
 From here, the entire Swat operation could be commanded
 suraksha ke lihaaj se bhi fajalullah ne is ilaake ko chunaa tha
 Because this area is surrounded by tribes from all around
 kabayaliyon ke bich taliban kii acchhee paith thi isliye ye zyada mahfuj tha
 This Headquarters of Imamaderi was also well liked by Fazlullah's father-in-law Sufi Mohammad
 2007 main ye sufi mohammad ke kabje main tha
 Later, after agreement with the Pakistan Army, the government handed it over to the Sufi
 sufi mohammad ne ise phir apane damaad fajalullah ko saunp diya

 bhaajapa kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhakar sampradayik hinsa vidheyak kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki prastaavit vidheyak 'tabaahi kaa nuskhaa' he
 Modi accused the bill of attempting to encroach upon the jurisdiction of states and said that before taking any further steps in this regard, it should be discussed extensively with partners like state governments, political parties, police and security agency
 modi kii chitthee par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki sarkaar aam sahmati se aage badhane kii baat kar rahi he
 He said that an attempt will be made to build consensus on this bill
 singh ne kaha ki sarkaar vidheyakon ko sugamawa se paarit karana sunishchit karne ke liye sansad ke sabhi virgon kaa sahyog chaahati he
 Significantly, this letter of Modi came in the morning at the beginning of the cold session of Parliament
 maujuuda satr main vidheyak par charchaa hone kii ummid he
 Modi alleged in his letter, the Communal Violence Bill is misconceived, as it is, prepared and a recipe for destruction
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, raajnneeti ke kaarnon se, or vaastavik sarokaar kii bajaay vot bank raajnneeti ke chalate vidheyak ko laane kaa samay sandigdh he
 Modi said that with the proposed law people will be further divided on religious and linguistic basis
 unhone kaha, prastaavit vidheyak se dharmik or bhashaai shinaakht or bhi majboot hongi or hinsa kii maamuli ghatnaon ko bhi sampradayik rang diya jayega or is tarah vidheyak jo hasil karnaa chahta he uskaa ulataa nateeja aayega
 The BJP leader also raised the 'work Issues' of the proposed Communal Violence Elimination (justice and Reimbursement) Bill, 2013
 unhone kaha, misaal ke taur par anuchhed 3 (epa) jo 'vaimnasypurna vaataavaran' ko paribhaashit karata he, vyapak, aspasht he or durupyog ke liye khulaa he
 Similarly, the definition of communal violence under Article 3 (d) read with Article 4 will raise the question whether the concept of 'thought crime' is being brought up in the context of Indian criminal jurisprudence at the Center, Modi said
 venkaiya ne mahila shashaktikaran or mahilaon ko samaan avasar dene kii aavashyaktaa par jor dete hue kaha, ‘‘ham apane desh ko bhi bharat mata yaa madar india kehete hai

 html Now the time has come for India to win the World Cup Cricket Trophy for the second time, such a wish has been expressed by Captain Kapil Dev of the Indian cricket team who became world champion 28 years ago
 kapil ne aashaa vyakt kii ki dhoni vah captain ho saktaa he jo desh ko duusari baar vishwa cap dilaa saktaa he
 Kapil, who came here for a program, said that i wish him (dhoni team) all the best and want him to sit with me as the World Cup winning captain
 mai 28 saal se intjaar kar rahaa hum
 Our thinking should be positive
 team kaa prayek khilaadi yah soch kar maidan main jaae ki use vishwa cap jeetna he
 The team has the potential to win the World Cup
 kapil ne is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya ki bhartiya cricket team kii gendbaaji kamjor he
 He said that we have played seven matches with this bowling attack and so far everything has been fine, the bowlers must have done something to reach the semi-finals
 raajnneeti ke maahir khilaadi maane jane vaale harish ravat kaa bahubali cheharaa uttarakhand ke janamanas ko raas nahin aayaa
 As a result, he had to face defeat from Haridwar Rural and Kichha assembly constituencies
 modi kii aandhi main ravat apni seat tak nahin bachaa paae
 Apart from this, the Congress also lost face in the state
 haal hi chunaav se pehlerawat kaa bahubali rup soshal mediaper khub viral hua tha
 Considered the most popular face of the Congress in the state, Rawat reached the Lok Sabha after winning the election four times
 vah rajyasabha sadsy bhi rahe, lekin party kii ore se hameshaa upeksha kaa shikaar hote rahe
 Rawat is considered a strong opponent of former Chief Minister and senior Congress leader ND Tiwari
 tiwari ke chalate unako soobe kii raajnneeti se lambey samay tak dur rakhaa gaya, lekin unhone congress kaa daaman nahin choda
 Therefore, Rawat continued to receive attention in the politics of the Center
 soobe main jab congress kii sarkaar bani, to unako darkinar kar vijay bahuguna ko mukhyamantri bana diya gaya
 However, due to his popularity and strong penetration among the public, Rawat's stature did not diminish and there came a time when Vijay Bahuguna had to quit as Chief Minister and was replaced by Rawat
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad ravat ke khilaaf unki hi party ke netaa baghawat par utar aae
 At the same time, taking advantage of factionalism in the Congress, the BJP government at the Center sacked the Harish Rawat government, but later the Supreme Court restored the Harish Rawat government and he again became the Chief Minister
 sting oparation se kharaab hui chhavimukhyamantri rahatehrish ravat kaa stingavidia saamne aane se siyaasi galiyaaron main hadakamp much gaya
 Rawat's image was shaken by the purchase of mlas surfacing the sting
 maamle main unako sibiai ne saman jari kiya or unase poochtacha kii
 In the CBI interrogation, he had justified the sting video, but denied the purchase of mlas
 iske alaava vah party ke bheetar gutbaji ko bhi rokane main vifal rahe

 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that people are worried about their children's school in view of the incidents which have come up in NCR
 sisodiya ne privet skool ke maalikon ke raajnneetik sampark kii baat bhi kahi
 After the meeting with the government and non-government officials, Sisodia said, "I had spoken about the CBI investigation only when the incident happened in Ryan, but nothing happened
" 
 Because these schools have a political link
 isi vajah se ye skool is tarah se kaam kar rahe hai
 The cctvs at Ryan School were bad, is this not a major flaw? Sisodia said that in the meeting, the Delhi government took some decisions regarding the schools: - All government or non-government schools will have to get police verification of their staff
 iske liye skulon ko 3 hafte kaa samay diya jayega
 During this period, schools will not be able to get police verification of their staff
 - sabhi skulon ko hafte bhar ke andar apane puure staff kii sari jaankaree najdiki police thane ko deni hogi
 - All information about the staff will have to be put on the portal of the Directorate, so that we can know which staff is working and whether or not police verification has been done
 - sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sabhi skulon kehar classroom main sisitivilgegaa
 CCTV will have to be installed almost everywhere in the school premises
 sisitivi sahi se kaam kar rahe hai yaa nahin isaki jaankaree har maheene principal ko deni hogi
 On the rape case with a 5-year-old girl in a Delhi school, Sisodia said, "in the information that has been received about the Tagore school, it has been found that the accused used to run a rickshaw and supply food as well as guard
 Was
 shuruaati jaankaree ke mutabik bacchee ko us din tution padhaane ke liye roka gaya tha, jabaki shanivaar ko sabhi skool band hote hai
 We are trying to find out why the school was opened on Saturday and what kind of tuition was prevented for the first class girl
 abhi puri report nahin ai he
 i think there is something big wrong with this school which is under investigation

 rahul gandhivahin, agsit pole main congress ko uske ummid ke mutabik siten nahin milane kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he, haalanki jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki party agar 100 kaa aankada paar karti he to yah uske or adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke liye thodi sahaj sthiti ho sakati he
 By the way, after reaching the floor with hail in the last Lok Sabha elections, this time the centenary of seats is definitely a challenging target for the Congress
 duusari taraf dedh saal pehle party kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale rahul kii netritv kshamta kii pariksha bhi he, haalanki, party kaa maananaa he ki congress rahul gandhi ke netritv main kaaphi acha pradarshan karegi
 The Congress was reduced to 44 seats in the 2014 general election
 vah party kaa ab tak kaa sabase kharaab pradarshan tha
 The pre-election and post-poll surveys are talking about an increase in Congress seats, although there is no forecast of the party reaching power easily
 jaankaron kii maane to congress ke liye sahaj sthiti yah hogi ki vah 100 ke aankade tak pahunche, lekin agar aisa nahin hota he to phir rahul gandhi ke netritv par bhi kuch had tak sawaal khadey hone lagenge
 Tej Pratap has been angry with his family for a few months, as his family did not let him divorce his wife Aishwarya Rai
 yahaan tak ki jab unki baat nahin maani gai to vah ghar chhodkar chale gaye the or kuch saptaah ke liye baahar hi rahe the
 Tej Pratap's wife Aishwarya Rai is still living with the Lalu family
 sabase buree baat yah yah he ki tej pratap ke sasur chandrika raay unke pita lalu prasad yadav kii seat saaran se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav won the Saran seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 lalu prasad yadav kaa yah aakhri chunaav tha, kyonki iske baad unhen chaara ghotaale main doshi qaraar de diya gaya, jisaki vajah se unke chunaav ladane par bain lag gaya
 Rabri Devi had initially agreed to contest from this seat, but perhaps she refused due to her health
 tej pratap ne iskaa virodh kiya or argedy kii student wing se istipha dekar nai party banane kii dhamkee de daali
 However, he decided to name his party as 'lalu-rabri Morcha'
 lekin tejasvi yadav ne unki baat ko nazarandaaj karte hue chandrika raay ko ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 Tej Pratap has now threatened that he will contest from Saran seat if the ticket is not withdrawn from Chandrika Rai
 iske saath hi vah shivahar or jahanabad seat se apane kareebi logon ke liye tikat chaahate hai
 If this does not happen, Tej Pratap has reportedly threatened to field his candidate under the banner of his new party
 sutron ne bataaya ki tej pratap sabase zyada naaraaz tab hue, jab unke ek bhi kareebi ko tikat nahin diya gaya
 However, during the assembly elections he managed to get tickets to some of his close ones
 lekin ab faisla lene kaa adhikari unke chote bhai tejasvi ke paas he or tej pratap kaa prachaar or tikat baantne main koi bhoomika nahin he
 Family sources say that Tej Pratap is the eldest son, but both Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi believe that Tejashwi Yadav has proved himself and will continue to be the political heir
 ve yah bhi jaanate hai ki tejpratap rabari devi ke bade bhai sadhu yadav ke prabhaav main hai, jinke paas ek samay main party main kaaphi chalati thi
 But later he was expelled from the party by Lalu Yadav
 sutron ne kaha ki tejpratap ke jariye sadhu yadav vaapasi karne kii koshish kar rahe hai

 He opposed Mahatma Gandhi's idea of non-violent freedom struggle
 is maamle main saavarkar lenin jaise krantikariyon ko zyada vyaavhaarik maanate the
 In the twentieth century, India House in London was a major center of the freedom struggle outside the country

 Three young writers Vijayashree Tanveer, Divya Prakash Dubey and Satya Vyas gave their opinion in the 'literature of Youngistan' session on the 'halla Bol' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak'
 is seshan kaa sanchaalan ajtak ke agjicutive editor said ansaari ne kiya
 During this discussion, all the three guests kept their words calmly
 charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue said ne kaha ki hamaare teenon mehmaanon se sawaal bas yahi he ki kya jo hamaara aaj kaa yuva he ise alag sahitya chahie
 Vijayashree Tanveer started the discussion by stating that what was there before was that writers used to write compositions and writers used to read poets, poets were writing poems and poets were the only ones who were young, and now the youth has created a new readership apart from writers
 wo ek bada pathak varg he, wo lekhak bhi nahin he, vah ek aam pathak he
 Who are just connected
 apana intertenment kar rahe hai
 Hindi was very neglected for some time
 kyonki badi baari-bharkam shabd samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 The youth wrote Hindi easily
 lekin bade logon ne unhen angikaar nahin kiya
 i say that by making Hindi free from bondage, we should also pursue new people

 Divya Prakash Dubey said that purity of language is a very big thing
 ek misskancepshan he ki hamaare dada-naanaa bahut shuddh hindi bolte the lekin aisa nahin he
 People who are making a story on Instagram will not speak the same language
 isliye hamane jo baaten ham chaay kii tapari par bolte hai waisi bhashaa main likhane kii koshish kii
 Satya Vyas used the language of Abe-tbe in 1948, furthering the discussion, saying that Kedarnath Gupta used the language of Abe-tbe in his book in 1948
 bhagwaticharan verma kii kitaab he teen varsh usamen dekhenge to choti-moti gaaliyaan hai
 For which we are told that we are corrupting the language
 bas itnaa he ki ham us samay main aae jab hamaari hindi ko soshal media kaa saath bhi mila
 We did not start anything new
 hamen bas focus zyada mila
 Our marketing strategy also worked in it
 jo language hamaari thi wo logon tak pahunchi or logon ko hamaara likhaa pasand aayaa
 Today, the star is everywhere, talking about Anupama Ganguly's fourth love, Vijayashree Tanveer said that this is a story collection and most of the stories are focused on extramarital affairs
 lekin aisa sochakar maine nahin likhaa tha
 About fourth love, i say that we have not had many affairs too
 ham kai baar logon ke prati jhuk jate hai
 i have written what happens in ordinary life
 divya prakaash dube ne apni kitaab condishan applai ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki jo baat dhire se kahi jaati he samaaj main us baat se maine approach liya tha
 Today the star is everywhere
 meri pehali kitaab main thi bharmaar galisatya prakaash ne charchaa main apni raay rakhte hue kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki jis tarah main likhata hum usamen galatiyon kii bahut sambhaavna he kyonki main likhte hue khud ko bahut freedom detaa hum
 When my first book came, i abused it profusely
 lekin vah banaras kii prishthbhumi par thi or vahaan gaali ke bina koi baat hi nahin hoti
 The second book i wrote at the Delhi Durbar, when i sent it to the publisher, he said that it has 7 affairs of a character Rahul Mishra, it does not happen in ordinary life
 maine unase kaha ki main nayaa-nayaa hum, aapako meri duusari kitaab chhapni he aap 4 afaire kar den lekin rahul mishra ke 7 afaire the
 The content itself will advance the book, while talking on the correctness of the language, Vijayasree further said that i believe that language should not distort us
 aap likhie, jahaan jarurat padegi likhnaa padegaa, maahaul to bananaa padegaa, lekin jabardastee thunsna nahin chahie
 The book should not be made famous by forcible abuse
 masala dene kii koshish nahin honi chahie
 Taking a further part in the discussion, Satya Prakash said that our gurus never advised to become popular through contrast
 unhone hameshaa yahi kaha ki tumhaare content main dam hona chahie
 There will be one to two days of discussion with the control and marketing strategy
 content hi kitaab ko aage badhayega
 Whatever language we speak, we wrote Likadiri Prakash Dubey, saying that Manohar Shyam Joshi's One Line Thought is that a lot of legs have to be pressed to knock back in Hindi
 ham saare nae logon ne kabhi yah lod nahin liya isiilie hamaare upar koi bagaj nahin liya
 We were not featured in any Hindi-based magazine

 Divya Prakash said that all of us who came forward with new breed had a good experience
 mujhe hameshaa laga ki hamen logon ne bahut protsaahit kiya
 Old people encouraged a lot
 kuch tusal log har jagah hote hai
 Politics did not come in our way

 gutvadita sabhi jagah havijayshri ne kaha ki gutvadita sabhi jagah he
 When new people come, people think that what it will be able to write, even the publisher does not know because we are not printed anywhere
 chhapane kii lekhakon kii jo prakritik prakriya he uske tahat ham nahin aate
 That's why publishers ask for money
 mujhe ratti bhar sangharsh nahin kiya, maine publisher ko kol kiya to unhone kaha ki mere editor ko kuch content bhej die
 Three days later, he received a call that we do not print him with the most money
 jis content main hamen lagata he ki isko ham bench paaenge ham usase paise nahin lenge
 What will a horse eat if it is fed with grass
 publication chalaane ke liye bhi paisa chahie
 The publisher has his helplessness, Satya Prakash also said that he never asked for money from the publisher
 lekin prakaashak kii bhi apni majaburi hoti he
 He gets 150 Pandalupis a month
 bahut samay aisa hota he ki use 5-10 pandelpiyaan pasand aati hai
 He puts his money in it, he tells the rest that we cannot print them or we will print this book with shared capital
 kehane kaa matlab agar aapako kitaab chhapavani he to aadha paisa aap denge aadha ham lagaayenge
 After that 70 out of that 140 Pandalupis get ready and 70 say that we were asked for money
 70 log jo paise lagaakar kitaab chhapavate hai unke liye hi chhapaas rog kaha jaataa he
 100-200 books a year
 yah lekhak par he ki jab prakaashak ne content chhapane se manaa kar diya to aap uski baat maane or apane kaam main mehnat karen

 The High Court had said in its judgment that it was not proved that Salman was killed by his licensee gun
 tippaniyan In fact, during the entire hearing in the High Court, the case of the lone eye witness Harish Dulani's disappearance came to light
 uski gavaahi nahin hone ke kaaran cese kamjor ho gaya or faisla salmaan khan ke paksh main chalaa gaya
 Significantly, a third case of black deer hunting is still under consideration in Rajasthan
 2006 main salmaan khan ko chinkaara maamle main nichali adaalat ne paanch saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 He also spent a week in Jodhpur jail and was granted bail after that
 darasal hai court main puri sunwaayee ke dauraan ekmaatr chashmadid gavaah harish dulani ke gaayab rahane kaa maamla prakaash main aayaa
 The case was weakened due to his absence and the verdict went in favor of Salman Khan
 gauratlab he ki kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa ek teesraa maamla abhi rajasthan main vichaaradhin he
 In 2006, Salman Khan was sentenced to five years by the trial court in the Chinkara case
 unhone ek saptaah jodhpur kii jail main bhi bitaye the or uske baad unako jamaanat mil gai thi

 The Congress prince Rahul Gandhi was never known for his speeches, but this time he got a great opportunity which he gave away
 apane chuninda kaaryakartaaon ke saamne unhone kai baaten kahin or kai uplabdhiyon ko ginaya jinamein artiai bhi he
 He discussed NREGA, Aadhaar, Panchayati Raj etc
 chunavi bigul bajaate hue unhone oonche swar main apane kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya or unamem utsaah bharne kii koshish bhi kii
 But the demands of the workers to become PM candidates with great precision were deferred
 unhone loktantr par baaten kin, party ke bare main kaha or use ek soch bataaya
 He also suggested some public breathtaking things like increasing the number of LPG cylinders to 12 annually
 unhone kaaryakartaaon ko khush karne ke liye yah bhi kaha ki unase poochkar hi ummidavaar tay kiye jaaenge yani party main aantarik loktantr kii ek shuruyaat
 Rahul is young and so in his speech he kept the youth section in mind
 rahul gandhi ne vipaksh kii marketing kii charchaa kii lekin sawaal yah he ki unhen apni marketing se koun roak rahaa he
 There can be a lot of marketing on the achievements they are talking about
 is baat par vah vipaksh kii aalochana kaise kar sakate hai?unhone sach bolne ke maamle main puraane netaaon ko yaad kiya
 His photo appeared but why did not this thing be said about contemporary leaders? Why did he keep quiet on big allegations of corruption? He did not speak on what moto the party would fight in the election and what would be its slogan
 matlab yah he ki aaj jo bhi mudde praasangik hai unki unhone upeksha kar di
 This speech cannot be said to be the best in his life
 hamen shaayad abhi or intazaar karnaa hoga or unke bhaashan likhane waalon ko bhi or mehnat kerani hogi
 At the beginning of Rahul Gandhi's speech, he did not show any enthusiasm nor did he show the aggressive style which is seen in the captain leading the soldiers in the war
 yah ek aise sainik kaa andaaj nahin laga jo aar-paar kii ladaai main bhaag lene ja rahaa ho
 The attitude of the fighting soldiers is different and that attitude did not show here
 bas dikhi to ek maa kaa damakata hua cheharaa or uski mamata bhari ankhen

 In the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Tuesday, there was an uproar against the recently announced administrative units by the state government
 vipaksh ke jabardast hangaame ke kaaran sadan ko kai baar sthagit karnaa padaa, vahiin is hangaame main ek vidhayak ko chot bhi ai
 As soon as the budget session of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly began at 10 am on Tuesday, PDP mlas started a commotion with banners in their hands
 vipakshi vidhayakon kaa aarope tha ki sarkaar ne haal hi jin prashasnic ikaayiyon ke gathan kii ghoshnaa kii he unamem vipaksh ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 PDP president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that the government had earlier constituted two committees for the formation of these units, whose members had visited the state and submitted their report in 2011
 lekin us report ko aaj tak sadan main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Mehbooba said that in the report presented by the Cabinet Sub Committee, the areas of the opposition mlas have been ignored
 raajnneetik napha-nuksaan ko dekh kar hui ghoshnaayempidipi ne aarope lagaaya he ki jin prashasnic ikaayiyon kii ghoshnaa kii gai vah raajnneetik napha-nuksaan ko dekh kar kiya gaya
 The PDP said that his party has raised the voice of the people for the last five-and-a-half years and whatever happened in the assembly today is the responsible government as the government has ignored the people
 pidipi ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar jab tak unki maangon kaa nipataara nahin karti wo sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan karte rahenge
 'opposition has no issue' On the other hand, the government claims that the PDP does not have any issues related to the people, so they create a ruckus in the Assembly in this way
 sarkaar kaa daawa he jis ilaake main jitani jarurat thi vahaan utani prashasnic ikaiyaan di gai hai
 Regardless of what the Opposition says on the issue, at present, BJP and Panthers Party mlas including PDP have also opened a front against the administrative units

 (input-ieenes) The film industry has received its first setback after Prasoon Joshi was appointed the new chairman of the censor board
 punjabi film 'tufaan singh' ko CBFC ne bain kar diya he
 The Punjabi film 'hurricane Singh' has been directed by Baghel Singh
 is film ke hero ranjit bawa hai, joki desh ke system or raajnneeti main maujuud bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye aatankwaadi gatividhiyon kaa sahaara letaa he
 In view of the violent content of the film, the censor board has banned it
 CBFC se jude sutara bataate hai- film mentufan singhek aatankwaadi kaa role adaa karata he, jo bhrasht netaaon or pulisavaalon ko nirmam hatya karata he
 The extent was reached when the makers compared Storm Singh to Shaheed Bhagat Singh in the film
 yah film behad hi krur or arajak he
 We cannot sympathize with the message of such cruelty
 prasoon joshi karte the kisi company main kaam, lajja se mili bollywood main entrifilm 'tufaan singh' ko lekar khaas baat he ki yah filmoversijamen 4 agast ko relies ho chuki he
 While its future seems to be hanging in the balance in India

 Thought that now there would be no problem in film certification
 lekin prasoon joshi kaa yah kadam mekars ke liye satbaque sabit ho saktaa he
