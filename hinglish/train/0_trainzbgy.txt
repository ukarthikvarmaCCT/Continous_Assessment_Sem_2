 The Reserve Bank made the first announcement last week by announcing a rupee-dollar currency-exchange opportunity worth five billion dollars (about 35,000 crore rupees)
 ise bainkon ko dhan uplabdh karakar byaaj daren nichi rakhane main madad karne vaale prayaas ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Under this, RBI will buy a total of five billion dollars through auction in the market on March 26, which is about one-fourth of the funds held as dollars of all banks
 in dollaron ko rigerv bank inhen bainkon ko 2022 main waapas bechega
 The move will not only enable banks to convert dollars kept in a safe currency to a disaster situation, but will also reduce the profitability of government bonds and make it easier for companies to raise resources through external commercial borrowings
 farvari main 25 aadhaar ankon kii katautee ke baad mudrasphiti kii dar nichi rahane ke purvanumaan ke saath is kadam kaa nateeja arabiai kii byaaj daron main or katautee dikh saktaa he
 According to CARE Ratings chief economist Madan Sabnavis, there has been a shortage of cash in the economy for a long time (see chart) as the growth rates of deposits and loans have not been the same
 isiilie repo dar se (jis par arabiai bainkon ko rin detaa he) hastkshep karne or khule bazaar kii gatividhiyon (jinamein rigerv bank samooche banking tantra main mudra kii maatra badhaane yaa ghataane ke liye sarkari pratibhutiyon kii kharid-bikri karata he) ke alaava rigerv bank ek nae tareeke se bazaar main mudra pravaah badhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Sabnavis says that it will cost Rs 35,000 crore
 mulya kii videshi mudra teen saal ke liye arabiai ke paas chali jaaegi, jo ise bazaar daron par waapas karegaa
 Inflation has been at a decent level in the past, but industrial production has been weak and is likely to remain the same in the coming months, so that the RBI can further reduce policy rates
 kaarkaanon kii utpaadan vruddhi dar pichley saal ke 7
 1 in January, down from 5 per cent
 7 fisadi rah gai thi kyonki menuphaccharing or bijli utpaadan pichad gaya
 However, retail inflation hit a four-month high of 2 in February
 6 fisadi par pahunch gai thi
 Normally, RBI gets about Rs 12,500 crore every week from the open market
 kii sarkari pratibhutiyon kii kharid karata he
 But it has chosen the month of March for currency-changing activity when there is a huge demand for money in the market
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki aisa karne se aashwast kiya ja sakegaa ki byaaj daren upar na jaaen tathaa rigerv bank ko bazaar se or pratibhutiyaan kharidne kii jarurat na pade or videshi mudra bazaar kii asthirataa main kami laai ja sake
 According to a Bloomberg report, in 2013, too, the Reserve Bank had asked banks to collect deposits in the form of dollars from nris, using foreign currency exchange to offset the rupee's weakness in a falling market
 kotak securities limited ke mudra vishleshak anindya banerjee kehete hai, ''rigerv bank bazaar se kah rahaa he ki vah rupee kii maujuuda majbootee ke prati sahaj nahin he
 At the same time, it is increasing the money supply to manage the liquidity requirement on the closing days of the financial year

 However, Sabnavis believes that such activities cannot be continued continuously
 *** On the fifth and final day of the third cricket Test between India and Australia, the great cricketer Sunil Gavaskar lost his cool due to the crowd of fans outside the commentary box for autographs and photographs as he was having trouble working due to outside noise
 yah ghatana somvaar dopaher mohali main punjab kicket sangh stadium main hui
 Taking advantage of the lack of security at the AC Lounge on the third floor of the stadium, some fans surrounded former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden like Jogavaskar commenting in English for the match
 prashansak iske baad heden ke autograph lene lage or unke saath photo khinchvaane lage
 After this, former Indian batsman Sanjay Manjrekar, commenting on the match, came out and he also had to give autographs to the fans
 baahar ho rahe hangaame se gavaskar naaraaz ho gaye jo isse kuch der pehle phone karne baahar aae the
 Angry Gavaskar said, 'you have come here to watch the match or to do something else
 kya aapako ehsaas he ki yah aawaaj andar aa rahi he jisase hamen pareshaani ho rahi he
 Gavaskar told fans not to sit in their seats and make noise

 Despite this, his family was not granted a visa
 gopal baagle ne bataaya kikulbhushan jadhavkahaan hai or kis haal main hai, iske bare main abhi bhi kuch pataa nahin he
 Because despite repeated saying, Pakistan is not giving any information about it
 bharat kareeb 45 saalon ke baad pehali baar international court of justise main kisi maamle ko lekar gaya he
 When asked about this, Gopal Bagle said that Kikul Bhushan is not just an innocent person but a child of the country

 Hearing of Kulbhushan Jadhav case will start soon: Hearing of Kulbhushan Jadhav case in Hague, Netherlands, will start in a few days and famous lawyer Harish Salve of India will plead the case on behalf of India
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne kaha ki pakistan se ilaaj ke liye bharat main aane waalon ke liye vija dena bharat sarkaar ne band nahin kiya he
 But the request to grant a visa for treatment on social media is difficult to accept

e

 So read wife / girlfriend Uwach - all day i work at home
 aapako kam se kam hafte main to chuttee mil bhi jaati he, par yahaan main choubison ghante-saaton din khatati rahati hum
 
 
 Listen to the scolding of husband / lover uwach-boss, then know what the burden of the office is
 
 
 pati-patni kii khatpat, ek duusare ke kaam ke kaam ko kam bataane kii hode
 
 
 If both are working, the dispute also goes up to an increasing breakup today
 
 
 or sach bataaun chahen bollywood ise kitna bhi glemries kare lekin saiyaan ji yaa sajani ji se brallep karke aaj bhi premi / premicaon yaa pati-patni ke dil dahaade markar rote hai
 And then controversy-uff

 And this chick-chick becomes a big fight one day
 ulate ko ulat kar sidhaa karne kii kalapati / premi -sara din tum ghar par kaam karti rahati ho

 haal hi main sej publication main prakashit ek report main is baat ko gambhirtha ke saath darj kiya gaya he
 a psychological research was conducted among romantic couples in the Netherlands and Canada
 is shodh ke liye aise sawaal taiyaar kiye gaye, jinamein donon partner se ek duusare ke bare main gratitude sho karne ke bare main sawaal kiye gaye
 He was asked how often he does a gratitude show about each other? Do you understand each other's sacrifice? How many times did they value each other's renunciation more than their own renunciation? Believe it is clear from the questions from husband-wife, lover-girlfriend that the reason for the quarrel between Sajni and Sajna is not to ignore each other's sacrifice
 
 
 
 
 visheshgyon kii maane to karnaa kuch he nahin
 
 
 Keep doing what you are doing

 And drive away the taste of Khwamkhwah

 Like he keeps his neck covered in sand
 ham bhi apano ko mahaan bataakar apana dimag band kar lete hai

 He filed his nomination for the post of Congress President on Monday and due to no rival, he is scheduled to be announced as the new party president on 11 December
 congress adhyaksh ke rup main rahul gandhi ke saamne saat badi chunautiyaan hongi
 Let's know what these seven challenges will be
 
 
 1
 Moving out of the shadow of the nehru-gandhi family, Narahul Gandhi has inherited the tag of the nehru-gandhi family
 lekin yuva voters ko lubhaane ke liye yah kaaphi nahin hoga
 The aspirations of young India have changed drastically and to reach them, Rahul Gandhi will have to step out of the shadow of nehru-indira Gandhi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii to yah khubi rahi he ki vah voters ke saath sidhe jud jate hai, rahul ko bhi isi tarah logon tak sidhi pahunch banane ke liye apni tarah kaa rasta nikaalnaa hoga
 2
 congress ko majboot bananarahul gandhi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti congress ko majboot karne kii he, jise saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main baari paraajay ke baad ek ke ek baad rajyon main haar milti rahi he
 Rahul is going to take charge of the Congress at a time when he has governments in only six states
 adhyaksh ke rup main rahul gandhi ke liye sabase bada kaam party or kaaryakartaaon main nai urja laana hi hoga
 3
 nae vijan ke saath party kaa netritvarahul gandhi ke maujuuda soshal media avatar kii har taraf charchaa he
 He has used common language in his speeches of Gujarat elections, due to which he has been able to connect with the people of the whole country
 jis tarah se chunavi mausam main rahul gandhi ne apni style main badlaav kiya he, usee tarah se unhen party main bhi nai drushti or taaje drushtikon ke saath badlaav karnaa hoga
 4
 modi lahar se nibatnacongress adhyaksh ke rup main ab rahul ko sidhe narendra modi se muqabla karnaa hoga
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has won several consecutive elections in the name of Modi
 modi lahar is kadar haaavee rahaa he ki usne congress se uske assam jaise paramparaagat garh bhi chin liye hai
 Dealing with this Modi wave will be a major challenge for Rahul
 5
 Creating a strong opposition One of the reasons for the bjp's good performance in elections is that the Congress' performance in and outside Parliament as the main opposition has faded
 congress ko jansabhaon se lekar sansad tak har maukey, mudde or manch kaa istemaal modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolne ke liye karnaa hoga
 Rahul Gandhi will have to lead as a strong opposition against the BJP government
 6
 Balancing between youth and seniors Another challenge facing Narahul will be to create a balance between youth and senior leaders in Congress
 congress kii kai rajya icaayiyon main yuva congressi chehron or varishton ke bich satta kaa takaraav chalata rahata he
 Sachin Pilot vs Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan, Jyotiraditya Scindia vs Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh and Ajay Maken vs Sheila Dixit in Delhi are some such examples
 7
 Winning the assembly elections in big states, Rahul Gandhi will have to take the responsibility of winning or losing in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh elections as the Congress President
 saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle agle saal bhi madhya pradesh, rajasthan aurkarnatakajaise bade rajyon main chunaav he
 The performance of the Congress in these states will decide what will be the future of Rahul Gandhi in the matter of challenging Narendra Modi

 ek baccha or uske pita kaa rishta kitna anmol hota he is baat main koi shaq nahin
 But do you know how much and how much time a father spends with his children, this also affects the intelligence of the child? This means that now it is not only a duty for a father to spend time with his child
 vakt gujaarna hai jarurihal hi menimpirial collegeoff landan main hue ek adhyayan kii report main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he ki agar pita apane bacchon ke saath kam umr se acha vakt gujaarta to bacchon kii budhimata par ek sakaaratmak asar padataa he
 The study also found that children of people with a calm, sensitive and less anxious nature make intelligent 'angsters'
 pita kaa bachche ke saath bachapan se hi ghulana-milanaa bachche ki kshamtaaon ko ubharta he
 What the researcher, Professor Paul Ramchandani of the Imperial College of London, told that, it is clear from this study that a father should get along with his child and have a good time, no matter how small
 
 imperial college ke shodhakartaaon ne 128 pitaaon or bacchon par ek shodh kiya
 During this research, he made videos of children up to 3 months old while playing with their father, and after 2 years took a test of the child's 'mental Development Index', such as identifying colors or shapes
 shodh main un bacchon ko zyada samajhadaar or budhimaan paaya gaya, jinke pita bachapan se hi unke saath khelte yaa vakt gujaarte aaye hai
 King College London researcher Vaheshta Sethna said that 'from this research we have learned how much positive effect a' reading activity 'and father's having with his child can have on the child
 to agar aap chaahate hai ki aapkaa baccha budhimaan or samajhadaar ho to uske saath acha vakt gujaarna shuru kar den

 Party sources are saying that Ajay Maken is not able to give much time to the party due to health reasons
 aise main pad chhodane kaa unhone faisla liya

 amethi or raibareli loksabhaa seat kii siyaasi jang ko fatah karne ke liye bijepi har sambhav kadam uthaa rahi he
 In Amethi, BJP candidates Smriti Irani and bjp's Dinesh Pratap Singh in Rae Bareli are campaigning along with party leaders as well as allies
 amethi-raibareli seat par paasi samudaay ke matadaata kingmekar kii bhoomika main he, jo congress kaa paramparaagat voter mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, BJP has used bjp's Lok Janshakti Party President Ram Vilas Paswan as a trump card to support the Pasi community in both these seats
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki paswan kii koshish congress ke durg main camel khilaa paaegi?amethi main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke khilaaf bijepi se smriti irani chunavi maidan main hai
 BJP has put a tremendous siege against Rahul
 is kadi main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne ramvilas paswan ko amethi or raibareli pahunchane or vahaan bijepi kii smriti irani or dinesh singh ke liye prachaar karne ko kaha
 After this, on April 28, Paswan addressed Gandhi Parivor as anti-dalit while addressing a public meeting at Rahimganj intersection of Parsedpur, a Pasi dominated area of amethi parliamentary constituency
 paswan ne kaha ki dalit utthan ke liye jitna kaam modi ne kiya he
 No government has done that much work
 unhone kaha ki modi ne dow
 Has given respect to Ambedkar
 essiasti act banaaya or wo log kehete hai ki modi dalit virdohi hai
 What do they know who is opposing whom? ham sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas main saath chal rahe he
 Modi made Dalit President, nobody has done this till date, even then he says that Modi is anti-dalit
 paswan amethi ke baad raibareli sansadeey seat ke mahrajganj kasbe ke baburiha maidan main bijepi pratyaashee dinesh pratap singh ke paksh jansabha ko sambodhit karnaa tha
 Paswan left for Lucknow without addressing the public meeting here
 is par bijepi netaaon ne tark diya ki helicopter ko utraane liye singnal nahin mili, jiske chalate landing nahin ho saki
 And Paswan could not address the public meeting
 vahiin duusari ore vipakshi dalon kaa kahana he ki jansabha main bheed juty hi nahin thi, jise paswan ne upar se dekh liya tha
 Due to this, they did not make the landing of their helicopter
 darasal amethi or raibareli sansadeey seat par paasi samudaay ke kingmekar kii bhoomika main he
 The voters of the Pasi community play an important role in deciding the victory and victory in both these seats
 aazaadee ke baad se in donon seat par paasi samudaay ke lok loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko vot karte hai or vidhansabha chunaav main unki pasand koi duusari party ban jaati he
 The BJP has used Paswan as a trump card to bring this traditional vote of the Congress to the BJP
 raibareli-amethi kii siyasat ko kareeb se dekhne vaale varisht patrkaar firoz nakvi kehete hai ramvilas paswan pehali baar amethi or raibareli main prachaar karne ke liye nahin utre hai
 He has earlier rallied both in favor and against the Congress
 lekin is ilaake ke paasi samudaay kaa dil jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho sake the
 He said that Ram Vilas Paswan comes from Dusadh caste
 yahi vajah he ki avadh ke paasi samudaay ke log unhen kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya he or nahin unase conect ho sakaa
 Feroze Naqvi says that when Paswan was a part of the UPA, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi came to ask for votes, but the Pasi community who were associated with the BSP did not come with the Congress
 aise main bijepi ke liye unki koshish rang laaegi yah kahana mushkil he
 However, political pundits are also considering the danger of their relationship with the Congress deteriorating due to Paswan's demand for BJP against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi
 amethi main prachaar ke baad ramvilas paswan ke liye chunaav baad kisi raajnneetik paristhiti main congress ke kheme main janaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 But Feroze Naqvi does not agree
 vah kehete hai ki rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf pehla chunaav sharad yadav lade the or aaj unke saath hai
 Similarly, in Chikkamagaluru against Indira Gandhi, who was a minister in his cabinet, who later threw an electoral vote against Indira Gandhi
 haalanki smriti irani ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad amethi main sakriy hai or unhone paasi samudaay ko saadhane ke liye kai kadam uthaae hai
 In this episode, he took forward MLA from Jagdishpur Suresh Passi and played an important role in getting a minister in the Yogi government
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki amethi main bijepi ke kai vidhayak smriti irani se naaraaz maane ja rahe hai
 Senior journalist Feroze Naqvi says that chemistry is more important than mathematics in politics
 jis prakaar chemistry main jab do chijen aapas main milti he teesri cheez bhi ban jaati he
 In the same way, when one caste meets another, then people of third caste also disperse
 aise main agar bijepi paasi samudaay ko jodne main kaamyaab hoti he to rajput yaa brahman ke chhitakane kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 Now this thing will be known only on 23 May

 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann Is the Chief Minister's face in Punjab from the party? a huge crowd is gathering in Bhagwant Mann's election meetings last year over the controversy over making a video of the Parliament and the party leaders are believed to be assessing him as the face of the Chief Minister
 aap netaa manish sisodiya ne haal main kaha bhi tha ki yadi party satta main aati he to punjab ke bheetar se hi koi rajya kaa mukhyamantri banegaa
 In fact, his statement came at a time when it was speculated that in the event of winning, the Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal would be the Chief Minister of Punjab
 dilli ke vidhayak rahe or punjab kii lambi vidhansabha seat ke pratyaashee jaranel singh ne NDTV ko bataaya, aap kii taraf se mukhyamantri 'pagadi dhari sikh hi hoga

 Bhagwant calls it the biggest electoral battle in Punjab
 tippaniyan As the election campaign in Punjab increases, the way the party is projecting Bhagwant Mann, it is believed that he is now ready for a bigger role
 jab NDTV ne unase poocha ki kya ve party kii taraf se mukhyamantri ke sambhavit daavedaar hai to unhaney is sambhaavna ko khaarij nahin karte hue kaha, ''maine kabhi nahin kaha ki main mukhyamantri banuunga lekin yahaan janata he
 Whatever they want to say
 
 
 kah rahe hai
 Our leadership has said that they will decide later
 hamen intjaar karnaa chahie

 It is believed that this could have a negative effect and hence you have not yet projected him as the face of the Chief Minister
 haalanki us puure prakaran ke dauraan party unke saath khadi rahi
 Significantly, Bhagwant Mann is a Lok Sabha MP from Sangrur in Punjab and he has four Lok Sabha members in Punjab
 purv main kamedian rahe bhagwant maan(44) punjab main behad lokapriy hai or party ke unke bharose ko isi se aanka ja saktaa he ki jalalabad vidhansabha seat se vah upmukhyamantri sukhbir badal ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai

" ve jo kahana chaahate hai
 
 
 Are saying hamaare netritv ne kaha he ki ve baad main tay karenge

 aam aadmi party sarkaar or alji daftar ke adhikaron ko lekar dilli vidhansabha main somvaar ko jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Speaker Ram Niwas Goel has expressed his displeasure at the lack of response to the question of mlas belonging to different departments of Delhi government in the House
 sadan main mantriyon, vidhayakon or adhikariyon ke 20 saal ke videshi dauron kii report pesh na karne par bada bavaal hua
 Speaker Ramnivas Goyal read out the letter from LG within the House about the question being asked by the mlas
 ram nivas nivas goyal ne sadan main bataaya ki alji ne unhen khat likhakar kaha he kidilli vidhansabhaspikar services, visilence, land jaise vibhaag se sambandhit koi sawaal sweekaar nahin kar sakate hai
 The speaker further objected to the letter from LG and said, 'efforts are being made to impose British rule in Delhi
 dilli main agar rape ho jaae to kya vidhayak vidhansabha main sawaal nahin uthaa sakate? alji ne kya tamaasha bana rakhaa he
 Why do not the officials answer the question of mlas? Not answering the questions is contempt of the House and the officials should answer all the questions asked in the Assembly
 'hangaame ke bich manish sisodiya nesadan ko bataaya ki dilli police, didie yaa services se agar koi jawaab aata he to sambandhit vibhaag ke mantri ko jaanakri di jaati he or unke hastakshar kiye jate hai
 But if any information coming directly to the speaker is unconstitutional, it needs to be investigated
 sisodiya ne aage kaha ki samvidhan ke tahat dilli vidhansabha bani he or grih mantralay ke daftar main baithe babu tay nahin karenge ki dilli vidhansabha kaise chalegi
 Sisodia said, 'the Delhi Legislative Assembly is not someone's legacy, but the people of Delhi
 koun vidhayak kahaan gaya, koun adhikari kahaan gaya, isaki jaankaree kyon chhupaai ja rahi he? agar 6 mantriyon ke bare poocha hota, to abtak sabaki jaankaree mil jaati
 They fear that the black truth of many officials and ministers will be revealed if they get information about foreign visits
 'videsh yatraaon ke sawaal par jawaab na milane kaa bijepi ne sadan main virodh kiya
 Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta said that the matter is not about the services
 donon sawaal is vidhansabha ke adhikaar kshetra main aate hai or iskaa jawaab milanaa chahie
 However, the speaker Ramnivas Goyal, while ruling, said that all such questions whose answers were not received from the concerned departments will be submitted to the Privileges Committee

 Differences have emerged in the Madhya Pradesh Congress over the decision to give Scindia the responsibility of Maharashtra

 imarti devi ne kaha ki maharaj jaane, party jaane yaa rahul gandhi jaane
 He said that if any responsibility is to be given to Maharaj, then give it in Madhya Pradesh
 maharashtra main maharaj ko koun poochhega
 Significantly, Imrati Devi is considered a staunch supporter of Jotiraditya Scindia
 aisa pehali baar nahin he, jab imarti devi ne sindhiya ke samarthan main bayaan diya ho
 She has also mentioned Jyotiraditya Scindia several times in the past as an appropriate choice for the state unit of Congress and the post of Congress president
 mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari kaa bhi kiya tha samarthanpichley varsh pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jab mukhyamantri pad ke liye kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ke naam chal rahe the, tab bhi imarti devi ne sindhiya kii daavedaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Earlier, she has also told Scindia a better option for the state president of Congress
 rashtriya adhyaksh ke liye bhi bataaya tha mufidarahul gandhi ke istife se rikt hue congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad ke liye bhi imarti devi ne sindhiya ko mufeed bataaya tha
 Not only Emrati, many leaders of the state were among those who supported Scindia's name for the national president
 uttar pradesh sahit 14 rajyon main incephelitis kaa asaruttar pradesh ke gorakhpur BRD medical college main ek ke baad ek 67 bacchon kii maut ne puure desh ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 Not only Uttar Pradesh but 14 states of the country suffer from encephalitis

 According to the Central Communicable Disease Control Program, Encephalitis is affected in 14 states, but the outbreak of this disease is more in Purvanchal in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh ke 12 jile is bimaari ke chapet main hai, inamen gorakhpur, maharajaganj kushinagar, basti, siddharthanagar, sant kabeernagar devaria or mau samet 12 gilen isse prabhavit he
 Dr
 RN Singh, who is working for the prevention of brain fever and waterborne disease interro viral in Gorakhpur, including Purvanchal, told a news agency that in some districts of Bihar, Bhigorakhpur is in a bad condition
 unhone kaha ki baaki rajyon main incephelitis se hone vaali mauton kaa akda dabaa diya jaataa he
 While the echo of deaths from this disease is heard more in Purvanchal including Gorakhpur
 doctor singh ne kaha ki gorakhpur medical college aspataal main har saal mastishk fever se saikadon bacchon kii maut hoti he
 Actually governments do not know what they have to do
 shaskeey tathaa saamaajik prayaason se tikaakaran ke jariye japani incephelitis ke maamalon main to kami laayi gai he, par jaljanit rog intero viral ko rokane ke liye koi thos kaarykram nahin he
 In the current time, the maximum deaths are due to intra-viral
 jaljanit rogon ko rokane ke liye kai saal pehle bana rashtriya kaarykram abhi tak prabhavi tareeke se lagu nahin ho sake hai
 Singh says that under this program, there were to be measures to prevent Japanese encephalitis, one India Mark Hand Pump was to be installed on every 10 houses to prevent interro viral
 jab tak khule main shouch band nahin hoga or paryaapt sankhya main handpump nahin lagenge tab tak is bimaari ko dur nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Singh said that instead of taking precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the disease, everyone is working on its treatment, while there is no cure, hence the disease remains
 unhone kaha ki isaki rokthaam ke liye holiya model of water purification kaa prayog kiya janaa chahievishwa swasthya sanghathan ne bhi is par muhar lagaayi he
 Giving information about this universal method of cleaning water, he said that by putting clean drinking water in a clean vessel in the sun for six hours, all its viruses die
 unhone kaha ki is paddati ko har vyakti apana saktaa he, kyonki isamen kisi tarah kaa koi kharch nahin he
 When asked about the causes of outbreak of meningitis in Purvanchal itself, Singh said that the area has the highest illiteracy and backwardness
 logon main saaf-safai kii aadat nahin he
 Due to lack of awareness in the society, this area remains a stronghold of these communicable diseases
 unhone incephelitis kii rokthaam main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke yogadan kii saraahna karte hue kaha ki yogi is beemaari ke unmoolan ke liye varsh 1996 se lagaataar kaam kar rahe hai

 It is becoming difficult to handle such a large crowd of youth

 During the Lok Sabha election campaign, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi made fun of his opponents by calling them 'khan Market Gang'
 is tanj kaa nishaanaa tha madhya dilli ke lutiyans bangala jone kaa vah lakadak market parisar, jo rashtriya rajdhani ke oonche or asardaar netaaon, sarkari adhikariyon, jajon, raison yaa kahen satta ke abhijanon kii rihaaish vaale ilaake kaa kathith taur par khaas thikaana he
 Some leaders of the same line are now frantically ripping off as an Enforcement Directorate (ED) 'gang' is behind them for alleged financial irregularities
 vidambnaa dekhie ki yah bhi usee khan market se sakriy he
 They are alleging that the Modi government is making revenge
 aarope he ki videshi mudra ulanghan or mani londring kii tahakikat karne vaala idi or kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ain chunaavon ke pehlevirodhiyon ko dhamkaane ke liye bhaajapa ke pratidwandvi netaaon ke khilaaf mukademe darj karne or jaanch main jute ja rahi he
 These allegations are neither new nor unique

 The ED, in its new avatar, is in the race to win the same title, as claimed by its opponents
 kendriya vitt mantralay ke tahat kaam karne vaale idi kii sthapana 1957 main hui thi
 It functions under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 and the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA), 2018

 The ED investigates all crimes under the PMLA

 The ED case, making the most recent headlines, is a summons sent to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) fraud fraud worth Rs 2,500 crore
 maamla bombai hycourt ke nirdesh par agast, 2019 main darj mumbai police kii exiar par aadhaarit he
 The FIR names the bank's directors, Sharad Pawar's nephew and former Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, and 70 former office bearers of the bank
 mul shikaayat 2015 main aarthik aparaadh shakha (iodblyoo) main darj kii gai thi
 Sharad Pawar alleges that just before the Maharashtra Assembly elections of October 21, the government is using various tactics to trap and harass opponents
 sharad pavaar ne elaan kiya ki ve ''dilli ke takht ke aage jhukenge nahin
 The BJP said in its defense that the case in the MSCB scam was registered on the directions of the High Court
 idi ke saman se centre or maharashtra sarkaar kaa kuch lenadena nahin he
 But the doubt arises that Sharad Pawar is named in the ed's Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) equivalent to the police FIR but not in the Mumbai Police FIR on which it is based
 pavaar kaa naam shikayatakarta surinder aroda ke mumbai police ko die poorak bayaan main aayaa he, jisamen kaha gaya ki yah ghotaalaa ensipi pramukh kii mileebhagat ke bina sambhav nahin tha
 This is not the first time a leader has come to the ED during the election

 Elections are going to be held on the same day in both Haryana and Maharashtra
 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se teen maheene pehle, idi ne bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se jude khate main 104 karod rupye or basapa pramukh mayawati ke bhai anand kumaar ke khate main lagbhag 1

 is saal janvari main, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle, idi ne 1,400 karod rupye ke dalit smarak ghotaale main upi main saat sthanon par chaape maare, jo rajya ke mukhyamantri ke rup main mayawati ke kaarykaal main hue the
 In the same month, the ED registered a case of money laundering against former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in an illegal mining case
 idi ke pramukh vishesh nideshak simanchal das ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya ki agency rajnatik pratishodh ke liye sarkaar ke aujaar kii tarah kaam kar rahi he
 "ED is not a tool of political vendetta," says Das
 vah police yaa sibiai ke maamla darj karne ke baad hi koi kadam uthaata he
 In almost all political cases, courts have found ED action appropriate
 '' supreme court ke vakil vijay paal daalamia, jinhone idi maamalon main apane kai muvakkilon kaa bachaav kiya he, das se sahamat hai
 "there is no doubt that the ED is aggressive in recent times," says Dalmia

 In December 2016, the then Joint Director (headquarters) of ED Rajeshwar Singh wrote a letter to the CBI Director about the irregularities related to the INX case
 sibiai ne 15 may, 2017 ko ek aapraadhik maamla darj kiya
 Three days later, the ED took cognizance of the CBI FIR and filed a case under PMLA
 chidambaram kii giraftaar ke lagbhag do hafte baad, 3 sitambar ko, idi ne sivakumar ko giraftaar kiya
 a 2017 income tax raid at Sivakumar's Bangalore home allegedly led to the recovery of disproportionate funds and Sivakumar's arrest came after an investigation into the same case
 karnataka ke purv mantri, tihaad jail kii usee unit main band hai jisamen chidambaram hai
 Both of them fueled speculation of a conspiracy from jail

 Shah was arrested in July 2010 in the fake encounter case of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, when Chidambaram was the Union Home Minister
 2014 main, sibiai kii ek adaalat ne shah ko sabhi aaropon se bari kar diya
 During the election of Congress treasurer Ahmed Patel to Rajya Sabha from Gujarat in 2017 and then to form the congress-janata Dal (secular) government in Karnataka in 2018, Sivakumar was instrumental in defeating the BJP twice
 yah alag baat he ki idi vitt mantralay ke tahat he
 Congress leaders claim that the ED has not sought Chidambaram's custody despite his surrender offer, as he wants to take steps only after getting bail in the CBI case involving INX Media
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad or prasiddh vakil abhishek manu singhvi kehete hai, ''chidambaram ko jail main lambey samay tak rahanaa pade, ise tay karne ke liye agenciyon ne sara naatak rachaa he
 The ED will only intervene and seek Chidambaram's remand when he realizes that it will not be possible for the CBI to keep him in jail under the natural legal process
 ''sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra bhi kai bhoomi saudon main kathith aniyamittaaon ke liye sibiai or idi ke nishane par rahe hai
 Of the two agencies, the ED has so far questioned Vadra eight times

 Although the CBI court has granted anticipatory bail to Vadra, the ED has challenged that bail in the Delhi High Court

 The opposition alleges that the ED is discriminating in choosing its targets and is not showing any activeness in the investigation of cases registered against BJP leaders or its friends

 The names of Roy and Sarma have surfaced in the Saradha chit fund scam, but the ED is yet to interrogate them even though it has questioned and filed charge sheets of several TMC leaders

 gandhi ne jagan mohan reddy, jo ab andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai, ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamalon kii jaanch kii thi
 In March this year, people were left shocked when news of the transfer of ED joint director Satyabrata Kumar, who was investigating against Nirav Modi in the Punjab National Bank fraud case came to light
 yah aadesh tab aayaa jab satyabrat modi ke pratyrpan main sahaayta ke liye landan main the
 ED chief s
 ke
 Mishra had reversed that order, but by then the agency's upheaval and politics had come to the surface
 pichley maheene idi ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya, jisamen koyala block aavanton maamalon kii jaanch kar rahe 42 adhikariyon ke sthanantaran kii anumati maangi gai
 The apex court has prohibited the transfer of officers without permission from all agencies investigating coal scam cases
 idi ke sutron ne kaha ki is kadam kaa uddeshy koyala ghotaale kii jaanch ko tej karnaa tha
 Mishra took charge in October 2018, so the 36 officers who came to the ED on deputation from various services were sent back to their respective organizations for reasons of transparency and efficiency
 idi ke do adhikariyon ke khilaaf mani londring ke maamle darj karaae gaye
 "ED is now getting streamlined," says Kapoor
 piemele ke tahat di gai shakti ke kaaran, idi ke kuch adhikari vyapaaree varg ko aatankit karte hue, jabaran vasuuli kar rahe the
 The PMLA was passed by the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which led to a massive change in the ED
 haalanki yah kanoon 2005 se prabhaav main aayaa tha
 Look at the irony, then Chidambaram used to be the finance minister
 vakil vijay paal daalamia kaa kahana he ki piemele main aspashtataa idi adhikariyon ko utsahit karti he to bhramit bhi kar sakati he
 He says, "there is no clarity about when a person can be arrested
" '' daalamia kaa kahana he ki 2019 ke sanshodhan se pehle, idi keval tabhi sampatti atech kar saktaa tha, agar uske paas yah vishwaas karne kaa paryaapt aadhaar he ki vah sampatti us 'aparaadh kii aay' se arjeet kii gai he or aaropee ise jaanch ke dauraan bech bhi saktaa tha
 "even if the property has already been attached by some other agency, the agency has demanded that property be attached," says Dalmia
 aisi sampatti kaa niptaan kaise kiya ja saktaa he? piemele ko or adhik sanshodhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 "if a person has committed an offense under 29 laws and 160 sections of PMLA, then the money earned from it or the property earned from it can be declared as 'proceeds of crime' and the ED can attach such money or property
 2015 main, is paribhaasha kaa vistaar kiya gaya taaki idi ko bharat main us sampatti ke baraabar mulya kii sampatti sanlagn karne kii anumati mili, agar aaropee dhan desh se baahar sthanantarit kar detaa he
 The 2019 amendments include capital and assets acquired through any criminal activity related to scheduled crime, even if it is not under the PMLA
 idi ke liye sabase bada dhabba uskaa kharaab aparaadh siddhi record he
 Of the more than 2,500 cases filed since 2005 under the PMLA, only 18 have been proven to be crimes
 lagbhag 689 maamalon main abhiyojan shikaayatein darj kii gai hai—450 se adhik maamle to pichley chaar varshon main darj kiye gaye hai
 This rise in activism can be attributed to the administrative reforms under the tenure of Karnal Singh, who initiated the policy of conducting vigilance checks of those officers before inducting them into the Enforcement Directorate
 sibiai adhikariyon ko die jane vaale 'vishesh jaanch protsaahan' kii tarj par idi ke adhikariyon ko bhi protsaahan pradaan kiya gaya
 Six dedicated forensic labs across the country and field forensic kits were made available for rapid cloning of hardware during raids
 karnal singh bataate hai, ''adhikariyon ko niyamit masik prashikshan die gaye
 "the PMLA has empowered the ED, so a big obstacle in front of it is that it cannot register a case on its own
" ek anya agency, jaise ki sibiai yaa rajya police ko pehle aavashyak aapraadhik maamla darj karnaa hota he jiske aadhaar par idi ek isiiar daakhil kar saktaa he
 The ED can receive complaints independently and conduct the first two levels of investigation under its provisions — T1 (primary) and T2 (detailed investigation) before sending it to the concerned agency to file a case in relation thereto
 idi ne disambar, 2016 main ienex media maamle main aniyamittaaon ke bare main sibiai ko likhaa
 CBI registered a criminal case in this context in May 2017

 These countries are Russia, UAE, Norway, Cyprus, Mauritius, Libya, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, France and Singapore
 idi ke adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki duusare charan kii deree adaalaton main hoti he
 The ED files prosecution complaints, which are equivalent to the charge sheet of the police, in the respective courts
 aisi adaalaton kii sankhya dhire-dhire bad rahi he
 All the sessions courts of Delhi are now ED courts
 adhikansh visheshgy yah maanate hai ki adaalaton main maamle kii lambaai do karkon par nirbhar karti he—idi kii dakshata or rajnatik hastkshep
 Therefore, depending on who is in the hands, in some cases it gets faster and other matters slow down
 idi adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki nideshaalay anek baadhaon ke bich kaam karne ke baavjood akatya maamle taiyaar karata he
 He argues that if the ED proved only 18 people guilty in 15 years, only one person was acquitted
 das kuch badi uplabdhiyaan bataate hai—agency vijay maalya or neerav modi ke khilaaf ek bhi maamla haar nahin rahi he or idi kii ore se prastut kiye gaye saakshyon ke kaaran hi in donon ko britain main jail bheja gaya tha
 In recent times, 13 cases related to funding of terror have been registered
 ye saare kaam tab hue hai jab idi apni aadhi takat par kaam kar rahaa he
 The sanctioned strength of ED is 2,024, while at present only 1,005 officers are working in it
 itnaa pangu hone ke baavjood, idi ne piemele ke tahat 2014 se 2019 ke bich 55,000 karod rupye se adhik kii sampatti ko atech kiya
 It has moved the court to seize Vijay Mallya's assets worth more than Rs 12,500 crore

 On 12 September, Prime Minister Modi said in Jharkhand, "our fight is against corruption and people involved in such activities

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) found all the ancient remains in an excavation at a site in Sanauli in Baghpat district of UP last June
 in avasheshon ko purv louh yug se lekar kaansya yug (2000 se 1800 isa purv, mahabharat kaal bhi lagbhag isi ko mana jaataa he) kaa mana ja rahaa he
 These remains have been brought to the Red Fort in Delhi

 Archaeologists Arvin and Sanjay Manjul, who are researching these relics in the Red Fort, told our associate publication Mail Today that many tests and studies are being done about them
 iske dwaara yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki jin logon ke kankal yaa anya avshesh mili hai unka rahan-sahan kis tarah kaa tha or unki maut kaise hui?pehali baar mila rathyah khoj hamaare pracheen itihaas ko jaanane ke lihaaj se kaaphi mahatvapurn sabit ho sakati he
 Sanjay Manjul, director of Institute of Orchology, said that this will give a new dimension to the study of ancient history
 unhone kaha ki puure bhartiya upmahadweep main pehali baar kisi khanan sthal se rath ke avshesh mili hai
 Earlier, the remains of such chariots were found only in Greek and Mesopotamia
 yahi nahin, is kalkhand kii mooth vaali talwaar bhi pehali baar mili he
 Apart from these, a casket-like coffin has also been found, which has a copper leaf design
 khanan sthal par dabe aath kabr paae gaye, jisamen ek kute kaa bhi shav tha
 Grains, glass, combs, gold beads, etc
 were kept in pots near these bodies, which Hindus often keep near the bodies of the dead for their ancestors

 aarope hai ki jagan kii companiyon main nivesh unke pita va tatkaaleen mukhyamantri wies rajasekhar reddy dwaara liye gaye paksh ke evaj main kiya gaya
 The CBI registered the case under the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act on the instructions of the Andhra Pradesh High Court

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa honeymoon period beshak ab peeche chhot chukaa he lekin aankade ab bhi unke paale main khadey najar aate hai
 He has completed a glorious first year in power, on this occasion 56 per cent of the respondents in the India Today group-cicero snap poll have described the functioning of the bjp-led NDA government as good
 acchhee khabaren yaheen nahin thamati haih bijepi kii voton kii hissedari main ijapha hua he, haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad yah kaaphi maamuli he
 However, the most shocking results of this survey are that the opposition parties are criticizing the Modi government for supporting the corporate world by accusing them of ignoring issues related to farmers and the poor, while their poor pro-image Bounce has been recorded
 march main karaae gaye india today desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main unka yah aankada 16 fisadi tha jo ab 23 fisadi par pahunch gaya he
 But the relief for Modi is not at all because 30 percent of the 7,652 respondents believe that the biggest failure of their first year in power is not to address the concerns of farmers
 inamen 43 fisadi log maanate hai ki endie ko 'suut boot kii sarkaar' qaraar dekar rahul gandhi ne thik hi kaha he
 The results of the survey conducted on the first year of the Modi government in power at the Center are revealed
 log abhi unhen vakt dena chaahate hai, lekin saath main ek chetavanee bhi jari karte hai
 With his 33 percent support, Modi still remains the most suitable person to lead the country
 lekin iske saath hi hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki agast, 2014 main india today samooh ke desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main modi ko hasil 57 fisadi samarthan ke aankadon ke mukaable ye taaja aankade kaaphi kam hai
 46 per cent of the people still believe that they have not met their aspirations till now
 surveykshan main shaamil aadhe se zyada yani 53 fisadi logon ne ab tak modi ke kiye 'achche din' ke vaade ko mahasoos nahin kiya he
 There are other concerns, some of them related to their communication strategy
 twitor trend or hashtag par ho rahe tamaam ho-halle ke baavjood haalat yah he ki 72 fisadi log soshal media par unhen follow nahin karte or isiilie is madhyam par prasaarit sandesh ko hasil karne se chook jate hai
 Modi and his ministers have to come to the ground as soon as possible and fulfill their promises

 PETA, an organization working for the interests of animals, has written a letter to all state governments demanding that illegal sacrifice of animals on the occasion of Bakrid be prevented
 peta ne kaha he ki pashuon kaa vadh sirf license vaale boojadkhaane main hi hona chahie
 The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has written a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all states, the Director General of Police, and several other departments including the Livestock Department requesting that all possible measures to prevent illegal trade and killings of animals before Bakrid Steps should be taken
 peta ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'rajya sarkaron kaa yah kartavya he ki desh ke pashu sangrakshan kanoonon ko lagu karen or iskaa paalan karaaen
 PETA demands that all authorities prohibit animal bites
 'peta india ne kaha he ki gosht ke liepashuon kii hatyaor unki qurbaani se sambandhit do maamalon par 17 farvari, 2017 or 10 april 2017 ke aadesh ke dwaara supreme court ne kaha tha ki pashuon kaa vadh keval aadhikarik license vaale boojadkhaane main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Hence the municipal corporations will have to follow this order
 'peta ne kaha ki jaanwaron kii hatya or qurbaani 'pashuon ke prati kurata niyam, 2001, khaadya suraksha evam maanak regulation, 2011 ke bhi khilaaf he
 According to the Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2011, the killing of camels is prohibited for meat, while the practice of sacrificing them during Bakrid is also practiced

 PETA has said that animal transportation rules, 1978 are also violated in the transportation of animals during the festival
 bhartiya cricket premiyon ko in dinon ek sawaal pareshaan kar rahaa he
 That question is when will the Indian team's defeat in the England tour finally end
 kya yah silsilaa ovel main shuukravaar ko khele jane vaale tisare ekadivasiy mukaable ke madhyam se tut paaegaa? yah ek moolbhoot sawaal he, lekin iske alaava bhi bhartiya cricket team kai sawaalon ke ghere main he
 These days, the fitness of Indian players is in the circle of questions, their ability is in the circle of questions, their preparation is in the circle of questions
 test cricket ke prati unki patibaddhta or samarpan sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Troubled by the injury and poor performance of many of its key players in the England tour, the Indian team has so far lost four Test matches, one Twenty20 match and one ODI
 use teen abhyaas maichon main jeet mili, lekin duusare ekadivasiy mukaable ko dekhakar yahi laga ki uskaa uske manobal par koi asar nahin padaa he
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, troubled by successive defeats, is now so nervous with questions that he himself is questioning journalists
 masalan, main kya kar saktaa hum
 
 
 
 ek samay aisa tha jab danaadan jeet hasil karne vaale is captain ko bolte hue rokane kii jarurat padati thi, lekin ab unke paas shabd kam padate dikhaai de rahe hai
 After seeing the start of the second ODI after being restricted to 23–23 overs, it was felt that the Indian team, which has become expert in quick cricket, would win this match and break the losing streak but the bowlers on the hard work of the batsmen Turned water jab kabhi bhartiya gendbaaj acha karte hai, to ballebaaj unki mehnat par pani pher dete hai or jab ballebaaj acha karte hai, to gendbaaj sari ranneeti ko matiamet kar dete hai
 All this is happening due to lack of confidence and this confidence will return only when the team gets a big win
 teesraa ekadivasiy match bhi barish ke saaye ke bich khelaa jayega, kyonki england main yah jhamajham barish kaa vakt hota he
 In such a situation, Indian players will have to be ready to play with the Twenty20 mentality while saving their wickets
 in sabake bich yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki kahin bhartiya khilaadiyon ke haath se test shrunkhlaa main mili haar kaa hisaab baraabar karne kaa mauka na nikal jaae
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his teammates have to remember that they have lost their credibility as the highest seeded team in the Test series, but their credibility is at stake as the current world champion in the ODI series
 yah saakh ovel main haar ke baad khatre main pad sakati he, kyonki 0-2 se pichhadane ke baad uske haath se shrunkhlaa jeetne kaa mauka nikal jayega
 The lines of struggle in the anti-mandal movement of the early nineties were clear: those who supported it were labeled as 'racist'
 yah aisa thappa tha jise 'pratibha-virdohi' hone kaa paryaay mana jaataa tha
 It was shown that this protest was motivated not by ethnic reasons but by genuine concern about the merit in the country
 yah baat usee dakiyanoosee maansikta ko majbootee de rahi thi ki yogyata yaa kshamta ucch-jati ke logon main naiysargik rup se hoti he
 In fact those opposing reservation were equally cautious and racist about their caste
 darasal ve apni jati ke visheshadhikaron ke sangrakshan ke liye badi chaturaai se pratibha ke prati chintaa kii aad le rahe the
 They considered those caste privileges as their right and were not ready to share with them even a little bit
 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main gujarat main jo aarakshan virdohi andolan shuru hua, usamen aarakshan or use hasil karne waalon kii ninda kii jaati thi
 The need for reservation was being touted as a weakness, it was linked to lack of real 'qualification'
 aarakshan virodhiyon kaa kahana tha ki 'yogyatavihin' log sarkaar par boj ban jaaenge
 The Scheduled Castes were then called government sons-in-law
 pehle saarvajanik kshetra rojgaar kaa pramukh kshetra tha jo dhire-dhire apni bhoomika se peeche hat rahaa tha, gharelu arthvyavastha kaa teji se nijeekaran or vaishvikaran kiya ja rahaa tha
 The government was moving from the old policy of retaining control over everything and moving forward on the policy of loosening, then new opportunities for economic growth were expected to open up
 nai tarah kii naukariyon kii sambhaavnaaen janm le rahi thim
 Also, there was a hope of increasing the number of jobs due to continuous economic growth
 is ashavad ke saath aarakshan virdohi vimarsh main kuch mili-jule badlaav dekhe jane lage
 When there is a bright, shining and constantly expanding world with arms outstretched, then who needs reservation in this dark and murky public area? That is it
 apan sidhe 2014 par aate hai
 Despite two tenures of the UPA government of steady development, there was uneasiness in India due to rampant corruption during this period
 haalanki vikaas kii dar acchhee thi phir bhi naukariyon main vruddhi kii dar bahut dhimi thi (is maamle main to nishchit rup se upie ke shasankaal kaa sabase kharaab samay bhi endie ke shasankaal ke sabase achche samay ke mukaable behatar najar aata he)
 In the 2014 election campaigns, the prospects of immense prosperity in a strong government led by the BJP will be put to the new, this mirage has fascinated innumerable Indians
 bahut se udaar log bhi mohit ho gaye
 In the hope of a development storm under Modi's leadership, he spread his eyes to Modi ignoring the past of violence against Muslims in Gujarat and the NDA won a landslide victory
 spasht rup se, pichley paanch varshon main vaisaa vikaas nahin hua jiskaa daawa kiya gaya tha or na hi sarkari naukariyon ke prati aakarshan main waisi kami ai jaisi sambhaavna jataai gai thi
 a whirlwind of the development of which the tsunami was talked about could not arise
 krishi aay ko doguna karnaa; videshon main jamaa kaale dhan kii ghar vaapasi se har bhartiya ke khate main 15 lakh rupye aane kii baat jaise samruddhi ke sabhi vaade or sabase ahm ki naukariyon kii baadh laga dene kaa vaada ek krur mrigatrushna banakar rah gaya he
 The 2017-18 report of the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) periodic labor force survey, which was suppressed by the government but made public by the Business Standard newspaper
 yah report darshaati he ki 2017-18 main gramin kshetron main yuva purushon kii berogari badhkar 17
 4 percent, which was 5 percent in 2011-12
 vahiin 2017-18 main gramin kshetra main mahilaon kii berogari badhkar 13
 6 percent, which was 4 in 2011-12
 8 fisad thi
 This means that the economy not only failed to generate sufficient number of new jobs but also various government schemes were not able to handle the situation of economic crisis
 is avadhi main aarakshan kota kii maang main bhi phir se jabardast ubhaar dekhne ko mila
 The boom with which the thriving, landowners and politically influential communities like Patidar in Gujarat, Jat in Haryana, Kapu in Andhra Pradesh - have led to employment opportunities in government and public sectors and reservation in jobs and higher education This is a sign that a large part of these communities have not been able to grow sufficiently
 aarakshan cote main shaamil kiye jane kii unki maang darshaati he ki unhen acchhee naukariyon or apane yuvaaon ke liye aajeevika ke sthir sroton kii talash he kyonki vyapak or bahuaiami krishi sankat ke kaaran unki aajeevika ke paaramparik strot bharosemand nahin rah gaye
 As irrational as they may feel because of structural changes in the economy that are not beneficial to them, the irony of this quagmire of quota among the dominant castes is clear
 pehla to yahi ki ve apane is aagrah ko chhodie ke liye khushi-khushi taiyaar hai ki aarakshan kamjor yaa aksham logon kii pahchaan he
 Second, by analyzing any socioeconomic indicator, you can see that only high and (non-obc) dominant castes and communities remain at the top
 naukariyon ke jo avasar khule un par mukhya rup se un logon kaa kabja ho gaya jo vikaas kii daud main aage the yaa phir angreji bhashaa or takneekee kaushal kaa laabh uthaane main sakasham the
 The caste difference has not been reduced on most of the important indices and there has not been any major reversal in the high and low historically prevalent among the castes
 agar ise saaf-saaf kahen to bazaar kii aguai vaale vikaas se ucch or pramukh jatiyon ke sabhi sadsy labhanvit nahin hue
 But those who benefited from it were from economically superior and socially already influential castes
 aarthik sankat par endie kii pratikriyapichley paanch varshon ke kharaab aarthik record se dhyaan hataane ke liye bhaajapa netritv ek ranneeti ke tahat pichley 70 varsh ke congress ke kaaryon par dosha madh rahaa he
 The BJP is so focused on Nehru that if one thinks that Nehru did not actually die in 1964, then it is no surprise
 aarthik vifaltaaon se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye jo anya prayaason main kuch lachchhedaar naare shaamil hai, uske tahat puraani yojanaon (nirmal bharat abhiyaan kaa naam badalakar svachh bharat abhiyaan), yaa phir aise kaaryakramon kaa jor-shor se prachaar kiya gaya jinka dharaatal par koi vajood hi nahin he (beti bachaao beti padhaao, mek in india yaa smart city)
 If new skills cannot be used in India, then schemes like Skill India are meaningless

 But the implementation of GST was very poorly done
 chunaavon ke ain pehle aarthik kuprabandhan or vifaltaa ko dhakne kaa aakhri pramukh kadam rahaa 124waan sanvaidhanik sanshodhan
 It aims to provide 10 percent reservation in jobs and educational institutions to the 'economically weaker sections' (EWS) of the general category
 yah ek aitihaasik kadam he, isliye nahin ki yah haashie par khadey yaa vanchit samoohon ke liye cote kaa praavdhaan karke unhen aage badhaane main sahaayak hoga, balki isliye kyonki isane aarakshan kii mul avadharana ko hi ulat diya he
 This quota of reservation on economic grounds is stated to be for the 'economically Weaker Sections' (EWS) of non-sc / ST castes
 yah sarkaar kii sakaaratmak pahalon kii niti main do badlaavon ko ingit karata he
 One is that being low in the caste hierarchy of society does not mean that it is indicative of economic or social backwardness
 or doosraa ki aarakshan khaas taur se jati-aadhaarit bhedbhaavon ko dur karne ke liye nahin he
 Additionally, EWS status is an inconsistent name: an income limit of Rs 8 lakh per year means that 97 per cent of all families are eligible
 sarkaar savarnon ko sanket dena chaahati he ki vah daliton or adivaasiyon ke prati bhedbhaav kii pratipurti kii guarantee dene vaale ek nitigat dhaanche se kinaaraa karne ke liye taiyaar he
 After this declaration, anti-reservation tsunami of hatred and openly racist hatred were absent
 pehle jati-aadhaarit aarakshan ko lekar jo oonchi jatiyaan yogyata ke saath samjhaute kii duhai dekar chaati peeta karti thim, unhone is badlaav kaa khule dil se swaagat kiya
 If the lynching of Dalits doing their traditional livelihood works, snatching their livelihood in the name of cow protection, violence against them for having interracial marriage and violence against protesting legally declared untouchability from entering the temple if If added to this, all the things are clear like the writing written on the wall
 sattarudh gathbandhan daliton ko mili adhikaron ko chhinane ke tareeke talash rahaa he
 However much the rhetoric can be done, there is no sense of building a caste-free system
 makasad to bas un jatiyon ke adhikaron ko kund karnaa he, jo haashie par hai or jinke saath bhedbhaav hota aayaa he
 Will it be able to turn into votes? Apart from strengthening its penetration among the upper-caste Hindus, the BJP also hopes that by announcing reservations it will be able to create the illusion of taking decisive steps on the job front
 agle ek maheene main sab saaf ho jayega ki matadaata is dhundhlee tasviir ke peeche kii sachaai ko dekh paa rahe hai yaa nahin—ki jin naukariyon ke avasaron main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he usamen nae-nae hissedaaron ko jodate janaa behatar aajeevika kii guarantee nahin ho saktaa
 We need a growing economy, which is able to provide productive employment for our youth and unemployed population
 aarthik sankat hakeekat haih sanshodhit jidipi vikaas dar yah darshaati he ki bhartiya arthvyavastha endie ke kaarykaal main upie-2 ke kaarykaal ke mukaable kahin zyada teji se badi
 But this amendment indicates a slight blackening in the pulses as other indicators of economic mobility (income tax hike, car sales, railway passenger revenue figures, cement production, etc
) would chug this pink picture presented by the government
 Huh
 pichley paanch dashakon main open animplayament sabase adhik he
 Agriculture is still a source of livelihood for most Indians, but it is badly threatened due to rising costs and uncertain incomes
 sabhi ke liye aarakshan is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 The need for reservation is for marginalized and most deprived groups of society; And management of employment is important for everyone
 achche din kii bajaae, hamen pichley paanch varshon main roodhiwaadee, bahusankhyakwaadi, kattarpanthi or sampradayik sarkaar kaa aavesh or paagalpan hi dekhne ko mila he
 On his part, there were attempts to rewrite the idea of india in a way that is completely contrary to the original hypothesis of the Constitution
 ummid he ki matadaata, aarakshan main nae cote ko lekar jo ghoshnaaen hui hai, uske nihitarth or sachaai ko samajhenge ki ve keval lachchhedaar jumale bhar hai
 Hopefully, they will entrust the new government with the responsibility of drawing up an economy capable of meeting the huge demand for jobs

 The meeting lasted for about two and a half hours with the top officials of the police and home department
 is baithak ke baad unhone rajya bhar ke jiladhikariyon or police adhikshakon ke saath video conference kii
 Before going into specifics and asking the Superintendents of Police to do a weekly crime review, Nitish said, "the officers should get out (from their offices) to find out what is happening on the ground
" bhrashtachar or aparaadh ko ham bilkul sahan nahin karenge, or haal kii ghatnaayen pareshaan kar rahi hai
 There will be a system for continuous evaluation of all police stations
 ''haal ke varshon main bihar ke sabase lambey samay tak mukhyamantri rah chuke nitish kumaar ke liye yah sab rosemara ke kaamkaaj jaisaa lag rahaa tha
 But the readiness with which he has started the latest innings as Chief Minister, and the issue raised at the very beginning, shows his concern about sending the right message
 shaayad aisa is kaaran adhik tha kyonki ateet ke boj —gathbandhan sahyogi lalu prasad or baad main rabari devi kii hukumat, jise aksar 'jangal raaj' kaha jaataa he—or iske thik vipareet sthiti main khadi sushasan kii unki apni khaasiyat ne, nitish ko kanoon or vyavastha par dhyaan dene se shuruyaat karne ko majaboor kar diya
 In this first weekend, he certainly must have had clashes in Lalganj in Vaishali district, where a police sub-inspector and a teenager were killed, kidnapping of a businessman in Siwan and rape of a minor in Patna

 lalu ke bade bete tej pratap vastut: cabinet main tisare kram par hai
 Clearly, Nitish's chief strategist Prashant Kishore is the one who kept running between Nitish and Lalu and was instrumental in getting the two to agree on the final cabinet list on November 19, a day before the swearing-in ceremony
 suchi par hari jhandi lalu or nitish ke bich telephone par baatcheet ke baad di gai thi
 According to insiders, Nitish wanted to take only one of Lalu's two sons in his cabinet
 jedy (you) ke ek netaa bataate hai, ''lalu ko shuru main is vichaar se puri tarah gurej nahin tha, lekin aisa lagata he ki jab nitish vidhansabha adhyaksh ke taur par jedy (you) vidhayak par jor dene lage, to lalu tej pratap ko shaamil karne par ad gaye

 In February 2014, Chaudhary caused a political storm in Bihar when he notified 13 of the 22 RJD mlas as unaffiliated members

 In october-november last year, Chaudhary disqualified eight JD (U) mlas for opposing the leadership
 yahaan tak ki jab jeethanram maanjhi ne is varsh janvari-farvari main bijepi ke samarthan se nitish ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha, tab unhone vidhansabha kaa saamana kiye bina istipha dene ke apane nirnay ke liye choudhary ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
