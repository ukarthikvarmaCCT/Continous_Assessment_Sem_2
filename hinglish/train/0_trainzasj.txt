 or har prayog se kuch nayaa seekhney ko miltaa he
 So that, the next experiment can be better
 bhartiya antariksh agency isro (indian Space Research Organisation - ISRO) kaa Chandrayaan-2 moon mishan bhi isro vaigyanikon ke liye bahut kuch sikhaane vaala prayog sabit hua he
 Many things happened for the first time
 kai technology pehali baar viksit kii gai
 During changing orbit in space, they moved more in fixed speed and distance
 yani behatar orbit manuvaring kii gai
 This helped save Chandrayaan-2 fuel
 
 Come
 
 
 jaanate hai ki isro ne is Chandrayaan-2 mishan se kya-kya siikhaa1
 ISRO made the first lander and roverruss had previously spoken of giving the lander for Chandrayaan-2, but it declined after some time
 iske baad isro vaigyanikon ne faisla kiya ki ve khud apana lander banaaenge
 Build your rover
 isro vaigyanikon ne donon ko banaaya bhi
 Researched itself to build Lander and Rover
 dizin taiyaar kiya
 Then he made it
 in sabamein kareeb 11 saal lag gaye
 They were all made with indigenous technology
 rover ko hindustan aironautics limited ne banaakar 2015 main hi isro ko saunp diya tha
 At the same time, Vikram Lander's initial design was created by isro's Space Application Center Ahmedabad
 baad main ise bengalooru ke yuaressi ne viksit kiya
 2
 pehali baar kisi prakritik upgrah par lander-rover bhejisero ne chandrayan-2 se pehle tak kisi upgrah par lander yaa rover nahin bheja tha
 This is the first time that ISRO scientists sent their lander and rover to a natural satellite
 bhale hi vikram lander tay maarg or tay jagah par sahi se na utraa ho, lekin vah chand par he
 If all goes well, the lander and rover would have been investigating the environment, land, chemical properties of the moon right now
 isro ko chand kii khubasurat tasviren mil rahi hotin
 3
 chand ke dakshini dhruv par pehali baar bheja mishanbharat duniya kaa pehla desh he or isro duniya kii pehali spes agency he, jisane chand ke dakshini dhruv par apana yaan pahunchaaya he
 No country has done this before
 bhale hi mishan puri tarah se safal na hua ho, lekin vikram lander chand ke dakshini dhruv par ab bhi he
 ISRO scientists are constantly in touch with Vikram Lander
 taaki use phir se start karke kuch prayog karne laayak banaaya ja sake
 4
 pehali baar kisi selestial body par land karne kii takanic viksit keeisro vaigyanikon ne pehali baar kisi selestial body yani antarikshawya vastu par apana yaan land karaane ki takanic viksit kii
 Because, on most Celestial bodies except Earth, there is no air, gravity or atmosphere
 isliye vipareet paristhitiyon main kisi antarikshich vastu par apana yaan utaarne kii takanic viksit karnaa badi chunauti thi
 But our scientists did this work with utmost precision
 5
 Launched lander-rover-orbiter for the first time, ISRO scientists launched a satellite of this weight for the first time
 aamtaur par kisi satellite main ek hi hissaa hota he
 But, Chandrayaan-2 had three parts
 orbitor, vikram lander or pragyan rover
 The three were to be joined together in such a way that the Chandrayaan-2 composite module could easily fit into the payload fairing of the GSLV-MK3 rocket
 is kaam main bhi hamaare vaigyanikon ne safalataa hasil kii
 However, this task is not easy
 aapako rocket ke sabase upari hisse ke aakaar ke anusaar hi satellite ke aakaar ko bananaa hota he, taaki usamen vah feet ho sake
 6
 vishesh prakaar ke camere or sensors banaae gaespes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ke vaigyanikon ne orbitor, lander or rover ke liye vishesh prakaar ke camere or sensors banaae
 These cameras are capable of taking pictures of the moon's surface and space
 saath hi aise sensors banaae jo chand kii sataha, taapmaana, vaataavaran, radioactivity aadi kii jaanch kar saken
 Most of the young scientists of Ahmedabad ISRO Center were involved in this work

 isse pehle ki ham aapako party netritv kii sambhavit chintaa kii vajah bataaen kuch sawaal jaan lenaa behad jaruri hai
 Is the leadership of the Aam Aadmi Party keeping distance from Chandni Chowk from its own MLA Alka Lamba? Is Alka Lamba going away from the party leadership herself?

 sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye hamane sabase pehle 'aap' vidhayak alka lamba se baat karnaa chaahi, lekin sampark nahin ho paaya
 Sources close to Lamba, however, say they were not given any clear information about the January 12 meeting by the party leadership

 madhya pradesh ke chambal kshetra main bhind shahar main bhaajapa ke chunaav chinh camel se saje bhagava manch par amit shah khadey hai
 They loudly shout, "bharat Mata ki Jai!" The present public also repeats, but in a slightly weaker voice
 bhaajapa adhyaksh usase santusht nahin hote
 They ask, "brother, don't Chambal drink water today? This rally of Bhind is one of the public meetings of the five state assembly elections that Shah has addressed in the last two months
 inamen se zyaadaatar madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main huin
 According to his party people, this is twice the number of rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 yah sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 The party does not want to use its star campaigner excessively
 us antar ko shah khud paat rahe hai or ve iske liye rajyon main ek chor se duusare chor tak ja rahe hai
 They are drowning themselves in praise of local party workers and duping their z-plus security personnel, who have to struggle hard to control the crowd
 shah ne apni gati kaaphi tej kar rakhi he
 He is the first BJP president to address election rallies in small towns like Narwar, Bhind, Morena and Katni
 prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan unhone vipakshi dalon ko nishane par liya, congress ke pichley shashan ke bainks bhaajapa ke shashan kii tulana kii or apane bhaashanon ko sthaneey lok katha ke udaahranon se chatapata banaae rakhaa
 In Bhind, he brought out excerpts from the writings of Veer Savarkar praising the local people who helped Rani Lakshmibai in the battle of 1857
 isi tarah, jabalpur main shah ne gond rani durgavati kii shahadat ko yaad kiya jinhone akbar kii hamalavar sena se ladaai main apane praan nyochhavar kar die the
 During his visits to the Jabalpur area, Shah told BJP state president Rakesh Singh that the central government proposed to build memorials and museums of local heroes of 1857 — Raghunath Shah and Shankar Shah
 yaaden taaja karaane vaale unke bhaashan lambey hote gaye kyonki ve sthaneey logon se zyada se zyada samvaad karne lage hai
 In Morena, he attacked Congress President Rahul Gandhi and challenged him to reveal the names of five Kharif and five Rabi crops
 unhone kaha, "pichley dinon rahul baba aalu prasanskaran plant ke bare main baat kar rahe the
 
 
 But do they even know if the potato grows above the soil or below the soil
 
 
 ve italvi chashme ke saath kabhi bhi kisaanon ke dard kaa ehsaas nahin kar sakate
 "this is a new form of Shah as an eloquent speaker and public campaigner
" yah kaushal unhone pichley do saal main viksit kiya he
 He has acquired both the content and the art of presenting it from his political mentor Narendra Modi
 parde ke peeche ke sahaayak se lekar nipun sanghathankarta or ab ojasvi vaktaa ke rup main unke badlaav kii yatra lambii rahi he
 He started as a party worker in Gujarat in the 1980s working with Modi
 phir ve bhaajapa kii gujarat ikai ke upaadhyaksh bane or modi ke mukhyamantri rahete aath saal ke lambey antaraal tak rajya ke grih rajyamantri rahe
 It was only after he became the party's national president in 2014 that he started emerging at his level
 unke netritv main party ko mili chunavi kamyaabiyaan unki chhavi banane main kargar rahi hai
 In 2017, a strong electoral success in Uttar Pradesh introduced Shah as a passionate campaigner
 lekin tab bhi, unke bhaashan chote hote the
 This year his speech art is more nuanced, be it the ups and downs of voice, the selection of words, events and idioms, or the art of communicating to the crowd
 shah bataate hai, "main vakt ke saath-saath jimmedaariyon ke badaae ke saath paripakv hua hum
 Constant communication with people and activists has played a big role in my transformation as a speaker
 '' bhaajapa kii rashtriya soshal media ikai ke pramukh amit malviya kehete hai, "adhyakshaji kii bhaashan dene kii style anuthi he

 in teen rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav bhaajapa ke liye kadi chunauti hai
 He has been in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh since 2003 and there is strong anti-incumbency
 rajasthan main bhi bhaajapa satta main he or vahaan pichley do dashakon se koi bhi party lagaataar do baar chunaav nahin jeet saki he
 Shah started visiting these states even before the campaign was duly launched
 unhone booth kaaryakartaaon kii 31 rajya stareey baithkon ko sambodhit kiya tha taaki ve sarkari skiimon ke labhaarthiyon ko booth tak lekar aane kii ahmiyat ko samaj saken
 In these meetings, he calls upon the party workers to follow the "my booth, the strongest" plan so that every booth in every seat can be won
 lekin yah sara koi van-main sho nahin he
 Shah had given both exempt chief ministers - Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh - complete relaxation
 madhya pradesh main chouhan ne hi prachaar abhiyaan kii kaman sambhaal rakhi thi or party ke bhitari logon kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar siton par mukhyamantri ne hi pratyaashee tay kiye the
 Shah spent nearly a fortnight in the state and held meetings with party officials to identify and bring along the leaders who were sitting silent during these elections
 chhattisgarh main bhi shah ne prachaar abhiyaan ko raman singh ke irdgird ghoomane diya
 In the 90-member assembly, Shah interfered in deciding candidates for barely half a dozen seats
 bhaajapa ko sabase tagdi chunauti rajasthan main mil rahi he
 There Shah's strategy began with the party accepting the possibility of a worsening situation
 unhone iske kaarnon kii pahchaan kii or ve is nishkarsh par pahunche ki satta-virdohi lahar kaa saamana mahaj mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf baghawat karke nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It was Raje who along with the activists had to be on the forefront of campaigning and face the spread of any negativity prevailing against the party
 phir shah ne party kaaryakartaaon ko utsahit karnaa shuru kiya
 In April, he removed state president Ashok Parnami and appointed Madan Lal Saini, who has a Sangh background
 isse unhone yah sanket bhi diya ki party jamini kaaryakartaaon ko protsaahan detii he
 He tasked party general secretary (organization) Chandra Shekhar to unite the workers by visiting the state
 booth str ke kaaryakartaaon tak pahunch banane ke liye kuch sau jamini str ke netaaon ko bhi aage laayaa gaya
 In September, Shah began contacting mid-level leaders
 unhen yah ehsaas ho gaya ki raaje ke khilaaf koi khaas shikaayat nahin thi
 However, this atmosphere was also created in the party that "BJP government has to teach a lesson"
 lihaaja, unka aglaa kadam yah tha ki kaaryakartaaon main yah sandesh garh diya jaae ki kharaab shashan kii kisi bhi baat kaa saamana uplabdhiyon ke udaahranon ke saath karnaa he
 It is imperative for the party to achieve electoral success in Rajasthan to maintain an encouraging atmosphere at the national level for the 2019 general elections
 rajasthan main shah kaa ashavad is dharna par aadhaarit he ki party kaa patibaddh vot bank 200 siton vaali vidhansabha main use 80 siten to dilaa hi degaa
 If they can bring the party's well-wishers along, then this number can go up to 120
 bhaajapa ko yah bhi ummid he ki dami ummidavaar bhaajapa-virdohi maton ko baantne main kaamyaab ho jaaenge
 Most encounters with this can be close
 tikaton ke vitaran main party ne sangh or raaje kii ichchhaaon kaa khyaal rakhaa he
 The campaign is designed in such a way to ensure that the star campaigners — Modi, Shah, Raje and Yogi Adityanath — do not power each other's spheres of influence
 matdaan se pehle ke aakhri do hakraton ke prachaar ko is tarah se dhaala gaya he taaki hindutv or rashtrawaad ke mishran se satta-virdohi lahar kii hawa nikaali ja sake
 Shah is campaigning in those constituencies where the party is facing the strongest challenge
 unke bhaashanon main dushman, pakistan or bangladeshi pravaasiyon kaa zikr baar-baar aata he
 He says among the applause of the people, "when we come to power again in 2019, we will drive out the infiltrators from every part of the country, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 ''in teen rajyon main se ek main bhi haar shah ke liye ek dhakke ke samaan hogi or uskaa asar aam chunaavon par bhi pad saktaa he
 However, he says, "wait and see, we will win not only Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, but also Rajasthan
" '' in rajyon ke nateezon kii ahmiyat bahut zyada he

 Taking a dig at the Delhi government, he said that before the election Kejriwal said that there is no need to collect tax, because the government can run without tax

 Nikhil Chopra said, 'lokesh Rahul has done well recently
 vanade main vah is number par acha kar sakate hai

 hamaari raajnneeti agar vigyapanon or prabandhan par is kadar nirbhar hone lagegi to vahi hoga jo tamilnadu main hua he
 There is an appeal to political parties that whenever they get advertisements made, clear the agency that the actor who will work has not worked in the election advertisement of the opposing party
 darasal sara kuch vigyapanon par itnaa nirbhar ho gaya he ki aisi galati swaabhaavik he
 You know in Tamil Nadu that the parties there give the public from table fan to Mangalasutra and TV

 haryana main kuch din pehle hi dakshin-pashchimi monsoon ke sakriy hone se rajya ke vibhinn ilaakon par baadh kaa sankat mandaraane laga he
 There is a danger of flooding as a result of continuous rains in various high altitude areas of Haryana, Shivalik hills and Uttarakhand
 buudhvaar ko yahaan hathini kunda baraj se 50,000 kusek se zyada pani yamuna main choda gaya
 An official of the Hathini Kund Barrage control room told IANS, “we have released more than 50,000 cusecs of water from the Hathini Kund Barrage into the Yamuna
 oonchai vaale ilaakon se lagaataar pani aane kii vajah se hathini kunda main bahaav bahut zyada ho gaya tha isliye aisa karnaa padaa
 "he said," This has increased the level of Yamuna, but the situation is normal now
 hamane guuruuvaar ko jaraa bhi pani nahin choda
 "he said," If we release 400,000 cusecs or more of water in the Yamuna continuously for three-four days, then there can be trouble
 yadi yamuna main atyadhik pravaah hota he to 72 ghante ke andar pani dilli pahunch jayega
 Everything is under control at this time

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has passed away
 unhone dilli sthit akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (AIIMS) main akhiri saans lee
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who entered Indian politics in 1942 through the Quit India Movement, was not only a great leader, but also a good poet
 jab 25-26 june 1975 kii raat ko puraa hindustan so rahaa tha, tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne apatkaal laga diya
 This emergency is considered one of the dark days of Indian democracy
 is daurantal bihari vaajapeyijaise vipaksh ke tamaam bade netaaon ko jail main daal diya gaya tha
 Vajpayee wrote poems to protest against the Emergency while in jail
 puure desh ko jail main tabdeel kar diya gaya tha or virdohi swar ko dabaa diya gaya tha
 Click here to pay homage to Atalji
 Night-time newspapers were banned, restrictions on the gathering of people, prohibitions on protesting and the arrests of potential people who did so
 25 june 1975 kii us kaali raat ne 26 june ke samachar patron ke sampadakeey lekhon ko nigal liya
 Hundreds of veteran leaders were arrested overnight
 iske virodh main 14 november 1975 se 26 janvari 1976 tak chalane vaala mahasatyagrah, loktantr kii bahaali ke liye kiya gaya duniya kaa sabase bada ahimsaatmak satyagrah mana jaataa he
 During this time, many underground activists were caught due to their real identity and they also suffered many kinds of torture
 kaidi rahe netaa or kaviatal bihari vaajapeyidesh main ho rahe in bhumigat andolanon se avgat hote rahete the
 Read his first poem out of this pain
 
 
 anushaasan ke naam par anushaasan kaa khoonbhang kar diya sangh ko kaisaa chadha jununkaisa chadha junun, matra-puja pratibandhitkutil kar rahe keshav-kul kii kirti kalankitakah kaidi kaviry, tod kanoonee karagunjega bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa
 This poem of Atal used to inspire everyone, giving strength to new agitators
 apatkaal ke ek varsh puure hone par bhi atal bihari jail main the, tab unhone yah kavita likhi
 
 
 a year passed when the scorching Jeth Maassharad moonlight sadness filled the spring of the spring

 On the day of Nayaginta staring at the path, once a minute came, the one who passed away, one year passed
 asian khelon main ek baar phir mahila khilaadiyon ne apana jabardast pradarshan diya
 India finished 8th with a total of 57 medals
 in 57 padakon main mahilaon ne 28 padak jitate hue purushon ko baraabar kii takkar di
 India won a total of 11 gold medals
 yahaan bhi mahilaon ne lagbhag barabari kii takkar dete hue 5 padak apane naam kiye
 These numbers start to get bigger when we see that a smaller team of women is sent than the male players
 bharat main khelon ke prati yun hi zyada jaagarukta nahin dikhti aise main mahila khilaadiyon ke liye chunauti kaaphi bad jaati he
 Most women players belong to small towns and villages, making a career in sports in areas where girls have to struggle for even basic things like education is nothing short of a dream
 sabase zyada medal dene vaale rajya haryana main mahilaon kii sthiti kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ling anupaat main haryana main prati hajaar purushon ke mukaable sirf 879 mahilaayein he
 This figure is 940 per thousand men across the country
 bhartiya mahilaon ke padak sangharsh kii ek aisi daastaan he, jise sirf aankadon ke sahare nahin janaa ja saktaa
 Talk about Haryana, women also have to struggle to get basic things like education
 2011 ke survey ke mutabik jahaan rajya main 84 fisadi purush sakshar ho chuke hai vahiin keval 56 fisadi mahilaayein sakshar ho pai he
 The mother of three is well aware of Mary Kom's struggle
 bhartiya boxr sarita devi bhi ek bachche kii maa he
 Recently, expressing her pain, she said that her two-year-old son did not recognize her, as she could not give him time due to the practice of boxing
 in mahila khilaadiyon kii aarthik haalat bhi koi bahut behatar nahin hoti
 Estimate this with the fact that Sarita Devi, who was a victim of dishonesty in boxing, had to pay around 30 thousand rupees to appeal against the decision of the judges
 itane paise bhi unke paas nahin the or ek patrkaar se paise udhaar lene pade
 According to Sarita, 'I stayed away from my family and worked hard, but a player's pain can be known only by a player
 kisi afasar ne meri madad nahin kii, lekin bharat ke liye qurbaani dekar main khush hum
 However, Sarita had to relent in this entire controversy and had to apologize unconditionally
 in asian khelon ko is baat ke liye bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki tamaam vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi bhartiya mahila khilaadiyon ne jo paa liya he wo athulaneey he
 a country like China spends far more on sports than India
 khelon ke infrastracchar ke maamle main bhi wo hamase milon aage he
 So when you compare India's medals against China, you will also remember the Indian government's toughness towards sports
 philhal to badhai dijie in mahilaon ko jinhone bharat kaa naam puri duniyaan main raushan kar diya he
 They need respect and equal opportunities
 is mushkil daur main jab bhartiya mahilaayein purushon ko barabari kii takkar de rahi hai to jaraa sochie agar inhen jaruri suvidha or protsaahan diya jaae to ye kya kuch nahin hasil kar sakati

 taaja maamla rajkot ke dhoraji kaa he, jahaan ek muslim mahila (sherbanu) ko uske pati (rafique) ne fasebuk par talaak de diya
 The husband posted a picture with the wife on her Facebook page, writing that according to Sharia, i am giving my wife three divorces, divorces, divorces
 fasebuk post soshal media par viral hua to patni ne pati ke khilaaf police main maamla darj karavaaya
 It is being told that Sherbanu was married to Rafiq seven years ago
 nikaah ke teen din baad hisasuraal walonki ore se use pareshaan rakhaa gaya or sherbanu ke saath maansik or shaareerik atyaachaar bhi kiya gaya
 Gradually, thinking that everything would be fine, Sherbanu continued to suffer torture, but the extent was reached when his father-in-law tried to force him
 haalanki usne jab apane pati ko ye sab baat bataai to pati ne jaisaa uske pita kehete hai, vaisaa karne ke liye kaha
 After which the disturbed Sher Bano went to his father's house
 phir parivaar kii badanaami or sasuralwaalon kii zid ke baad wo wapasasasuralgai lekin pati ke saath ladaai-jhagada lagaataar jari rahaa
 Due to which, Sher Bano filed a case in court
 sherbanu ne media se baatcheet main bataaya ki court ne uske pati ko har maheene 2500 rupee dene kaa aadesh diya tha, jo wo kaaphi samay se nahin de rahaa tha
 The court then sentenced him to 25 days in jail
 jail jane se pehle hi uske pati ne fasebuk par post ke jarietlak de diya
 Sher Bano currently lives alone and works in a hospital to meet his expenses
 fasebuk par is tarah pati ke talaak dene ke baad ab sher bano ne khud ke liye nyaay kii guhaar lagaai he

 If the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was adamant that its events were not a threat to its existence after the Punjab and Goa election defeats, then its confidence in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections was shaken by its poor performance
 Where BJP has pushed it to second place with a big gap
 kabhi party ke disha-nirdeshak rahe prashanth bhushan, jinaki kanoonee sakriyata yathasthitwaad ke khilaaf "aap" ke sangharkshil nazariye kaa aks hua karti thi, kehete hai, "yah ant he
 "even though Bhushan had split up with Arvind Kejriwal with Yogendra Yadav, he appeared disappointed at the downfall of the Delhi Chief Minister
 apane utkarsh ke dinon main kejariwal bhartiya raajnneeti ke aise sanakee kirdaar the jo shakespeare ke vidooshak kii tarah satta ke munh par sach bolne kaa saahas rakhte the
 In the character of "muffler Man", he seemed to fulfill an impossible dream — a dream in which a normal man who is not a person of great weight nor who has any innate advantage, is merely on the strength of his whims and indomitable will
 Political corruption and privilege may be able to compete
 baad main haalanki kejariwal kaa tikhaapan or unki sahaj-buddhi gatiruddh ho gai or usne unmaad or apriy kism ke chidchidepan kii shakl le lee
 Bhushan admits, "we were fooled
 main nahin maanata ki ve bina siddhant yaa vichaardhaara vaale shaks hai
 There was a hunger to gain political power and to gain votes that he had nothing to lose in his way
 "apni rajnatik mahatvakankshaon ko apni ankhon ke saamne beete hafton main bikharata dekhne vaale kejariwal kya ab khud ko sanyamit karenge? sanket anukool nahin dikhte
 After the defeat in the Punjab elections, he has waged a war on evms in which he has started to doubt the voters' conscience
 haalanki haar ke turant baad kejariwal ne apana munh kam kholaa, yahaan tak ki bijepi ko shubhakamana tak de daali, lekin unke sahyogiyon ne khoj-khojkar har patrkaar ko yah samajhane kii koshish kii ki dosha iviem kaa he, france ne haalia raashtrapati chunaav ke pehle daur main mashiinon kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha or log bina kisi taarkik vajah ke bijepi ko vot die ja rahe hai
 Controversial MLA of AAP Somnath Bharti said, "I feel like a student who did a lot of studies but was beaten in the exam by those who bought the paper
 '' bharti kii twitor feed iviem se chhedchhad or matadaataaon ke farjivade se jude aaropon se bhari padi he
 Manish Sisodia, the chief executive of the Delhi government, walked out of a press conference raging about evms rapidly
 yah ummid karnaa jaldbaaji hogi ki party is baat ko sweekaar kar le ki bijepi ke haathon hui uski haar ke peeche uskaa prachaar abhiyaan tha jise manoj tiwari ne rajdhani ke 'purvaanchali' pravaasiyon par kendrit kar ke gadha tha
 Parallel to this, even though the hard work was done in the campaigning of AAP, its image remained negative due to which the Chief Minister's comment was that if the voters got dengue after electing BJP, they would be guilty themselves
 muft pani or sasti bijli ke lokapriy naare par savaar hokar dilli kii satta main ai 'aap' rajdhani kii surat par koi khaas asar nahin daal saki he jo dikhaai de sake
 Its office-bearers counted their successes — improving schools, meeting Mohalla clinics, facilities promised — which benefited the poor but remained invisible to the middle class
 isiilie press bhi party ko lekar dhiladhaala ravaiya apanaae rahaa
 The scale on which he is defeated suggests that the voter is no longer largely under the influence of the party
 isaki kuch vajah is tathy main ho sakati he ki dilli kii sarkaar nagar nigam or centre ke saath yahaan satta ko saajha karti he jis vajah se vah bahut badlaav nahin laa saki
 One reason may be that the party used its already limited resources in elections in Punjab and Goa, behind which the motivation was also working to show what they could do while in power of a state
 haalanki badi vajah yah rahi ki 'aap' apni jhagadaalu pravriti se bani chhavi main funskar rah gai jiske peeche kejariwal kii narendra modi ko takkar dene kii sanak kaam kar rahi thi or har kaam ke liye ve apane alaava baaki duniya ko doshi tehra rahe the
 It is quite possible that the Delhi government's confrontation with former Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung and its failure to control police and appointments and transfers have made the voter understand that the party is undergoing a complex division of administrative rights to the capital
 The beach is unable to function as a royal affair
 masalan, rajya sarkaar or emsidi ke bich adhikaron kaa bantwaaraa shahar kii sadakon kii chaudaai se lekar naaliyon jaise sookshm vivaranon tak failaa hua he jo rajdhani dilli kii prashasnic vishistataa he
 Before the election, Sisodia had expressed confidence in the prospects of AAP
 nagar nigam ke uttari, dakshini or purvi jone ke sambandh main unhone kaha tha, ''teenon main ham jeet rahe hai
 "sisodia is a man full of energy, shakes hands warmly, is optimistic, but his claim seems hollow
" sisodiya kai padon ko sushobhit karte hai jinamein shiksha vibhaag kaa kaarybhaar bhi ek he, jiske liye enjio kshetra main unke kai prashansak paidaa hue hai
 Many people working in this field said that they were greatly influenced by their ability to go into details, incorporating a technologist's perspective in their role, and accepting people's opinions
 bhaajapa main parade ke peeche kaam karne vaale ek ahm netaa sudhanshu mittal jo aksar party kii ore se bayaan dene ke kaam main lagaae jate hai, phone par bataate hai, ''dilli ke logon ne emsidi ke chunaav ko narendra modi or kejariwal ke prati dharna ke janamat sangrah kii tarah liya— kaise modi ek nai disha or ummid kii numaaindgi karte hai jabaki nai raajnneeti ke bare main kai badbolepan ke baavjood kejariwal ne keval puraane dharre ko hi kaayam rakhaa he—auraton kaa shoshan, farjivada, bhoomi lut, satta kaa durupyog or apmanjanak bhashaa
 Mittal said that Kejriwal should resign
 unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki 'aap' sarkaar ko isliye hataa diya janaa chahie kyonki ''dilli ke logon ne unhen asweekaar kar diya he
 "he criticized Kejriwal and his party for not being able to accept his defeat with due diligence," it is an insult to the mandate and people are not going to forgive him so soon
 ''mittal kii tarah bhushan ne bhi andeh jaahir kiya ki 'aap' sarkaar apana kaarykaal shaayad puraa na kar paae
 He said, "BJP can question the legitimacy of AAP government by using this election result and the report of the Shunglu Committee
 '' purna rajya na hone kii sthiti main dilli kaa dhaancha aisa he jahaan kii sarkaar ke paas adhikaar behad kam hai; nagar nigam par dashak bhar se bhaajapa kaa kabja rahaa he or aap kii haar kaa matlab yah banataa he ki nigamon ko niyantrit karne kaa ek mauka tathaa ek sarkaar ke bataur apni prabhaav kii raah main aane vaale ek ahm avrodh ko hataane kaa mauka usne ganvaa diya
 If 'AAP' is left for the next three years, then it will remain almost ineffective
 'aap' par kai kism kii aniyamittaaon, bhai-bhatijawad or prakriyaaon ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagane vaali shungalu cameti kii report ke aadhaar par hi leftinent governor anil baijal ne party ko south avenue sthit uskaa daftar khaali karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 21 out of 67 mlas of AAP can be declared invalid in terms of benefits, which is another example of the party's overthrow of rules
 congress samarthak tahseen poonawala kii daleel he ki ''arvind kejariwal jaise chatur netaa ko itani jaldi khaarij karnaa moorkhtapurna hoga,' lekin bhaajapa 'aap' ke vidhayakon ko apane main milaane or dilli sarkaar ko barkhaast karne kii sajeesh beshak kar rahi he
 Poonawalla says, "I am giving six months" to "AAP" because the BJP has a plan called Operation Lotus Bloom to remove the AAP government
 or chunaav ayog uskaa sahyog karegaa'' kuch log ise sajeesh kii kalpana kah sakate hai, lekin poonawala apane daawey ke samarthan main arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand ke udhaaharan dete hai jahaan pichley saal baagi vidhayakon ne sattadhari congress kii sarkaar ko hilaa diya tha
 Emphasizing that he is not a supporter of Kejriwal or 'AAP', Poonawala broadly seems to agree with his side of evms
 ve aarope lagaate hai, ''keval taanaashaahee main hi ek netaa lagaataar itnaa or baari margin se chunaav jeetta he
 If you ignore the peculiar confrontation on evms, then you can say that in your short history, you are at the lowest level today
 aisa lagata he ki 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav main 70 main se 67 siten jitkar sarkaar banane vaali 'aap' kaa vaikalpik raajnneeti kaa vaada ab dur kii kaudi ho chukaa he
 Encouraged by the victory, if the BJP is now feeling "free from questions", then the reason for this is that the victory of the AAP in the assembly elections was a sign that people are now out of traditional politics ie Congress and BJP Bored with punjab main jis tareeke se ye charchaaen chal padi thim ki 'aap' modi kaa ek sambhavit vipaksh ban kar ubhar sakati he, usne yah sanket pusht kiya tha ki log ab nae vichaaron ke liye taiyaar ho chuke hai
 This is the biggest failure of 'AAP' that those people are ready to take refuge in traditional politics and drown in Modi's aura
 'aap' se mohabhang ke shikaar duusare samarthakon or sadasyon kii tarah bhushan bhi yahi kehete hai ki paramparaagat raajnneeti kii ore vaapasi ke doshi kejariwal hi hai, ''unhone vaikalpik raajnneeti ke sarokaar ko sirf isliye peeche dhakel diya kyonki ve nijee virodh bardaasht karne kii takat nahin rakhte or khud ko chunavi jeet-haar ke alaava kisi or vichaar ke liye band rakhte hai
 In such a situation, it is clear that leaders like Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari and Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan are trying to measure Kejriwal's political neck and are demanding his resignation
 dilli main congress ke netaa ajay maakan to apni hi talwaar kaa shikaar ho gaye hai or philhal teen baar rajya kii mukhyamantri rah chukin shila dikshit ke saath jabaani jang main vyast hai
 Obviously, Kejriwal will not do the same again, at least till he is the Chief Minister
 sawaal uthta he ki kya desh main sabase zyada pahachaane jane vaale netaaon main ek kejariwal ke paas dobaaraa ubharne kaa koi tarika he? yogendra yadav ko lagata he ki ab yah nahin ho saktaa
 It is different that his own party could not do anything on its own
 tippaneekar santosh desai kii maane to kejariwal kaa sab kuch khap chukaa he
 They ask, 'now why would anyone vote for' AAP '? What does she represent now, which option? ”some party workers say that the party's audacity in Punjab and Goa outweighs her name
 emsidi chunaav se pehle sisodiya ne apane ghar main kaha tha ki kahin koi dikkat nahin he or dilli ke kaaryakarta 'aap' ke uthaae gaye kadamon kaa sandesh janata tak pahunchane main ji-jaan se jute hue hai
 The question is who should blame Kejriwal for Punjab, who felt that Punjab was in their grasp
 jaisaa bhushan kehete hai, kejariwal kii haar ke peeche maamla yah nahin he ki ve mukhyamantri ke kirdaar main sarvatha anupasthit rahe yaa phir modi ko chunauti dene ke sanak bhare sapane dekhte rahe
 The matter is that he has betrayed the trust of the public to whom he had taken a choice
 anna hajaare ne emsidi chunaav ke dauraan kaha tha, ''arvind logon ko bhul gaye hai
 "subrahmanyam Swamy tweeted," Mr
 420, you can always fool some people but not always fool everyone
 '' bhartiya raajnneeti main netaaon ko kai baar jeevandaan miltaa rahaa he lekin kejariwal ke maamle se bhaajapa kaa thodaa bhi lenaa-dena he, to samajhie ki unka marsia likhaa ja chukaa he
 Despite this, Kejriwal's priority should be that his government should complete its term
 unhen beshak gujarat ko ab bhula dena chahie jisaki ore 'aap' laalchee nigaah se dekh rahi thi or dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas uske sahare jeetne kii firaaq main thi
 They have to learn to deal with the BJP in a just manner; Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu had said, "you have to decide whether she wants to come with us or not
" '' bhoj ke intjaar main chaaron ore giddh mandara rahe hai
 Do Kejriwal and 'aap' have even a little life left to burn their lives in their dying project? hockey main bharat kii pakistan par phir badi jeet, ab 6-1 se rondabharat ne hockey main chir pratidwandvi pakistan par apana dabadabaa kaayam rakhaa he

 The Sri Lankan team left the team before the tour of India, after the resignation of Team India coach Anil Kumble, now the coach of Sri Lanka team Graham Ford has also resigned
 15 maheenon tak srilanka kii team ke saath jude rahane ke baad shanivaar ko graham ford ne team ko alavida kah diya
 South Africa's Graham Ford coached Sri Lanka from 2012 to 2014 and after that he joined the Sri Lankan team once again in February 2016 and his contract was till the 2019 World Cup, but due to personal reasons Ford Left his post in the middle

 If we talk about the allegations against Laxmikant and Sudhir Sharma, both of them earned huge amount of money in wrong ways due to the power they got
 donon par aarope he ki unhone vyaapman ghotaale main mukhya bhoomika nibhaai, jo kai saal tak madhya pradesh tak simit rahaa tha, lekin pichley kuch dinon main rashtriya scandal ban gaya he, kyonki charchaaen hai ki is ghotaale se jude 30 se bhi zyaada log rahasyamayi tareeke se maare gaye hai
 The Vyapam scam derives its name from the Vocational Examination Board (vyapam, for short), the institution that conducts examinations for admissions to colleges in the state as well as for recruitment in about 40 government departments
 asli parikshaarthiyon ke sthaan par kisi anya se parikshaayen likhavane ke liye rishwatein lee gayi, or isi ko lekar bade nataaon or varisht naukarshahon par gaiyrkanoonee kamai ke aarope lage

 lakshmikant sharma se sudhir kii mulaakaat vidisha main hi hui, or us samay lakshmikant vidhayak the
 In 2003, when Laxmikant Sharma became the Minister of Mining in Uma Bharti's government, Sudhir started working as his staff, and in 2006 Sudhir quit that job to try his luck in the mining sector
 yah kadam sudhir ke liye 'sone kii khan' sabit hua, or uske baad usne collejon ke group VNS group kaa adhigrahan kiya, jisamen ejineering or shaikshanik shiksha di jaati thi
 In the year 2010, Sudhir was made the head of Madhya Pradesh Education Cell of Bharatiya Janata Party
 varsh 2012 main sudhir ke chalate hi vyaapman ke pariksha niyantrak (examination controller) ke rup pankaj trivedi kii niyukti hui, jisaki badaulat baari kamai kii gai
 At that time Laxmikant Sharma was the Minister of Technical Education
 jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik yah ghotaalaa isi dauraan sabase zyaada phala-phula
 Two years later, Pankaj Trivedi was arrested on charges of molesting recruitment in medical colleges, and significant evidence was recovered from his possession, including computer files from which many political stalwarts like Governor Ram Naresh Yadav and Laxmikant Sharma Joined varsh 2013 tak sudhir or lakshmikant sharma kaa prabhutv lagbhag khatm ho gaya tha
 Laxmikant had lost the election due to allegations related to Vyapam, and Sudhir's bases were raided due to allegations of bribing government officials for promoting mining business
 tippaniyan According to an income tax report of 2013, the diaries received from Sudhir Sharma's possession revealed that between 2010 and 2013 he incurred other expenses related to air tickets and travel by top leaders of BJP and RSS (whose names include, They have denied any wrongdoing)
 report ke anusaar, sudhir sharma ko vyaapman ghotaale se jude do collejon se lagaataar paisa aata tha, jo turant hi mantri ji ke sahaayak ko bhej die jate the
 According to the report, here is Minister g Laxmikant Sharma, whose 'deep connection' with this millionaire should be investigated

 At a time when the news of government overshadowing the judiciary continues, a film has come out from the judiciary to testify in public
 film kii kahani aakiri seen se shuru hoti he
 When the camera starts zooming out of the court room in the wake of getting up, on the go, the judge tells the situation of the 3 crore pending cases and the number of twenty one thousand judges and says that sometimes there are cases when there seems to be Is that the purpose of your being in the smelly court room is becoming meaningful
 aamtaur par filmi jaj nirjeev praani kii tarah hote hai
 The system consists of a brick that was painted with Ramaras many years ago
 is film main jaj kaa swabhimaan jaagta he, iqbaal pukaarata he, wo bade vakil ke rutabe ke aage jhukta he magar chote vakil ko mauka detaa chalata he or order order karne ke bajaay ek jaj kaa haal bataata he
 While watching this film, we were imagining being in a court outside which a bunch of lawyers are killing journalists, inside the courtroom there is a frenzy of media-created nationalism, and Anirban, Omar and Kanhaiya make their arrest
 Stand for bail against wo us farvari kii baat thi, ye is farvari kii film he jiskaa naam 'jolly elelbi-2' he
 Film is a dramatic interpretation of history and the filmmaker is the bearer of historical truth- olive stone
 iskaa hindi tarjuma yah hua ki ek film itihaas kaa naatakeey roopantaran hoti he or film banane vaala aitihaasik sach kaa vaahak hota he
 Why Subhash Kapoor might have inserted this statement at the beginning of the film
 kitne to lekh chape honge ki bollywood ke filmmekar apane samay kii raajnneeti par khamosh rahete hai
 Remain afraid of the government
 jawaab nahin dete hai
 Looking at 'jolly LLB-2', you will know that a filmmaker has answered in his own way
 wo nyaaypalika main lambit mukademon par film banane nahin chalaa tha, balki pichley varshon kii raajnneeti or us raajnneeti ke vaahak media ko jawaab dene ke liye niklaa tha
 The speculative affair in Burka XI vs Veil XI and Beard XI vs Tilak XI was not worthless
 is satte ke bahaane sanjay mishra kaa kirdaar us raajnneeti ko expos karata he
 Makes all those debates meaningless, which these days are running on news channels under the pretext of divorce and burqa
 film sampradayik raajnneeti ke prachlit pratikon ko is tarah se pakad ke chhod detii he jaise ab inkaa istemaal ho chukaa he jitna hona tha
 Let us be entertained and bet on them now
 banaras ke ghat par sanjay mishra kaa kirdaar yun nahin kahata he ki burka ho yaa ghunghat, bhugatna auraton ko hi hota he
 The way a viewer reacts after watching a film depends on its geographical and psychological location
 kisi ko yah film desh kii kachhariyon ke baahar kii durdasha ko expos karne vaali lagati hogi to kisi ko is film main bihar or madhyapradesh ke vyapam jaise ghotaale kii jhalak dikhegi
 i went through the politics of the past year watching this film, using Olive Stone's statement that the filmmaker is the bearer of historical truth of his time even if he dramatizes that truth
 is film main subhash kapur ne yahi kiya he
 By dividing all the spectators divided in politics in a court room, he has been taught to differentiate between emotional boom and truth
 is film main nirdeshak ek professor kii bhoomika main he or darshak chaatr kii
 The story, screen play and direction work has been done by Subhash Kapoor
 court room main jab jagdishwar mishra or pramod maathur takaraate hai to vahaan ke tamaam prasang or samvaad hamaari dharanaon ko todane lagate hai jinhen rose media hamaare bheetar garh rahaa hota he
 All the episodes in the courtroom are episodes of news channels
 pramod maathur rashtrawaad, aatankwaad or yuddh kaa sahaara lekar tali bajwa lete hai
 Just as the anchors spread a frenzy during the JNU episode
 aatankwaad ke shikaar pariwaron or sainikon kii shahadat kaa sahaara lekar unmaad ko jaays tehraaya
 Jagadishwar Chaturvedi, a lawyer who came to Lucknow from Kanpur, becomes unarmed
 wo jiskaa cese lard rahaa he us par aatankwaadi hone kaa aarope he, vah musalmaan he, pramod maathur aatankwaad ke shikaar apane parivaar ke mukhiya yani baap ko court main laakar antim tark pesh kar dete hai
 Typical news channel style
 pramod maathur kaa vah kathan meerut kii kachhari se nahin aayaa he, jeneyu vaale prasang se aayaa he jab vah jaj se kahata he ki aaj desh dekh rahaa he ki aap kiske saath khadey hai
 With terrorism or with justice
 magar baazi palatati he
 Jagadishwar starts getting arguments
 wo dekh paata he ki kadri aatankwaadi he, kasim nahin
 Soldier Bhadoria is also killed in the game of killing Kasim by confronting him as Qadri
 baap kii jaan kii keemat bete ko mili muaavze kaa hisaab gina kar vasula ja rahaa he
 Pramod begins to cope slowly with irrefutable emotional arguments like Mathur's personal tragedy and war against the country
 aakiri over main santulit khilaadi kii tarah morcha sambhalata he or pramod maathur ke unmaadi tarkon ko dher karne lagata he
 When Jolly says that we need neither a police officer like Suryavir Singh to kill innocent people in the name of an encounter nor Iqbal Kadri to kill innocent people
 yuddh or prem main sab jaays nahin ho saktaa he
 i like the acting of Akshay Kumar
 unki eemaandaaree or saahas kaa kaayal ho gaya ki unhone is film ke liye haa kahi
 Media reports show that at times, in the name of nationalism, Akshay Kumar is seen standing with the sentiment of media and politics
 is film main ve usee unmaad ke kilaaf apana sab kuch daanv par lagaate hai or asli zindagi ke apane hi tarkon par cinema kii kahani main jeet hasil karte hai
 Akshay is a serious artist
 kalpana kar saktaa hum ki is film ko karne or dekhne ke baad unke kalakaar man ke chithde ud gaye honge
 This is a film that makes its own hero stand in the dock
 aainaa dikhaa detii he
 It would be nice to see any hero winning in his film
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki film main jeet kar asli zindagi main haar ko akshay ne kaise dekha hoga
 i clapped for Akshay Kumar's artist Mana
 tippaniyan 'jolly LLB-2' is a good film
 yah film aam logon se baaten karne ai he
 Common people should also talk to this film
 huma kuraishi kaa abhinay acha laga
 Huma's acting is a specialty
 wo abhinay nahin karti hai
 Just like in the story the story itself looks for them
 court room main unka akele tali bajaanaa ek sambhaavna kii tarah laga
 She claps and stands in front of the frenzied crowd, who just likes blatant sentiment in the name of nationalism
 tathyon or insaaf se bada kuch nahin hota
 Everything is not justified in love and war
 subhash kapur ne is film main brands ke liye lakhanu waalon kii sanak ko bahut salike se pesh kiya he
 i have a request from the director
 wo huma kuraishi ko gucchi kaa ek dress tohfe main de hi den
 Because this film is a story of being right on the screen of real life
 isliye kahani bhi asli zindagi main sach ho jaae to mazaa aa jaae

 Film is a dramatic interpretation of history and the filmmaker is the bearer of historical truth- olive stone
 Its Hindi pattern is that a film is a dramatic adaptation of history and the film maker is the bearer of historical truth
 subhash kapur ne film ke shuru main is kathan ko kyon daalaa hoga
 How many articles will be published that Bollywood filmmakers keep silent on the politics of their time
 sarkaar se bhaybheet rahete hai
 Do not answer 'jolly elelbi-2' dekhakar niklenge to aapako pataa chalegaa ki ek film nirmaataa ne apane tareeke se jawaab de diya he
 He did not go on to make films on pending litigations in the judiciary, but turned out to respond to the politics of previous years and the media that was the carrier of that politics
 burka ilevan banaam ghunghat ilevan or dadhi ilevan banaam tilak ilevan ke match main satta kaa prasang phaltu nahin tha
 The character of Sanjay Mishra exposes that politics on the pretext of this betting
 un tamaam bahason ko nirruthak bana detaa he, jo in dinon talaak or burka ke bahaane news channelon par chal rahe hai
 The film captures the prevalent symbols of communal politics in such a way that they are now used as they were
 chalo ab inase manoranjan kiya jaae or satta lagaaya jaae
 The character of Sanjay Mishra on the Ghats of Banaras does not say that women are to be burka or veil
 film dekhne ke baad darshak kis tarah se pratikriya vyakt karata he, yah uske bhugolic or manouvaigyanik lokation par nirbhar karata he
 Someone will find this film exposing the plight outside the courts of the country, then someone will get a glimpse of scams like Vyapam of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh in this film
 main is film ko dekhte hue pichley ek saal kii raajnneeti se guzarane laga, olive stone ke kathan ke sahare ki filmkaar apane samay ke aitihaasik satya kaa vaahak hota he bhale hi vah us satya kaa natya roopantaran karata he
 This is what Subhash Kapoor has done in this film
 raajnneeti main bante tamaam darshakon ko ek court room main bithakar unhen bhaavnaatmak uphaanon or satya ke bich fark karnaa siikhaa rahaa he
 In this film, the director plays a professor and the audience is a student
 kahani, screen play or nirdesan kaa kaam subhash kapur ne hi kiya he
 When Jagdishwar Mishra and Pramod Mathur collide in the court room, all the contexts and dialogues there break our perceptions which the media is building within us every day
 court room ke tamaam prasang news channelon ke prasang hai
 Pramod Mathur claps by resorting to nationalism, terrorism and war
 thik vaise hi jaise jeenyu ke prasang ke samay ankaron ne unmaad failaayaa tha
 Justified the frenzy by resorting to the martyrdom of families and soldiers who were victims of terrorism
 kanpur se lakhanu aayaa angadh vakil jagdishwar chaturvedi nihattha ho jaataa he
 The person who is fighting the case is accused of being a terrorist, he is a Muslim, Pramod Mathur brings the head of his family i
e
 the father in the court to the court and presents the final arguments
 tipical news channel style main
 That statement of Pramod Mathur does not come from the office of Meerut, from the context of genau when he tells the judge that today the country is watching with whom you are standing
 aatankwaad ke saath yaa insaaf ke saath
 But the game turns around
 jagdishwar ko tark milane lagate hai
 He is able to see that Qadri is a terrorist, not Qasim
 kasim ko kadri bataakar encounter main maarane ke khel main sipaahi bhadauria kii bhi jaan gai he
 The value of the father's life is being calculated by counting the compensation received by the son
 pramod maathur kii vyaktigat traasadee or desh ke kilaaf yuddh jaise akatya bhavuk tarkon ke aage dhire-dhire sanbhalane lagata he
 In the last over, the front is handled like a balanced player and Pramod starts to pile up the insane arguments of Mathur
 jab jolly kahata he ki hamen na to encounter ke naam par nirdosh logon kii hatya karne vaala suryaveer singh jaisaa police afasar chahie or naa hi bekasoor logon ko maarane vaala iqbaal kadri chahie
 All cannot be justified in war and love
 akshay kumaar ke abhinay ko pasand karata hum
 His honesty and courage convinced him that he said yes to this film
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki kai baar rashtrawaad ke naam par akshay kumaar media or raajnneeti kii bhavukta ke saath khadey nazar aate hai
 In this film, he bets everything against the same craze and wins in the cinema story on his own logic of real life
 akshay sanjeeda kalakaar hai
 i can imagine that after performing and watching this film, their actors must have been troubled
 yah aisi film he jo apane hi nayak ko katghare main khadaa kar detii he
 The mirror shows
 kisi bhi nayak ko apni film main jitate hue dekhnaa hi acha lagata hoga
 i do not know how Akshay would have seen the loss in real life by winning in the film
 maine akshay kumaar ke kalakaar man ke liye tali bajaai he
 The comments 'jolly elelbi-2' ek acchhee film he
 This film has come to talk to the common people
 aam logon ko bhi is film se baaten kerani chahie
 Huma Qureshi enjoyed acting
 huma ke abhinay kii ek khaasiyat he
 She does not act
 bas kahani main is tarah hoti hai jaise kahani khud unako dhundti ho
 His clapping alone in the court room seemed like a possibility
 wo us unmaadi bheed ke saamne khadi hokar tali bajaati he jise sirf rashtrawaad ke naam par kori bhavukta pasand aati he
 There is nothing greater than facts and justice
 prem or yuddh main sabakuch jaays nahin hota he
 Subhash Kapoor has very well introduced the Lucknow craze for the brand in this film
 meri nirdeshak se ek guzarish he
 They should give a gift of Gucci to Huma Qureshi
 kyonki yah film asli zindagi ke parde par sahi hone kii kahani he
 So, if the story comes true in real life, then enjoy it

 akshay kumaar ke abhinay ko pasand karata hum
 His honesty and courage convinced him that he said yes to this film
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki kai baar rashtrawaad ke naam par akshay kumaar media or raajnneeti kii bhavukta ke saath khadey nazar aate hai
 In this film, he bets everything against the same craze and wins in the cinema story on his own logic of real life
 akshay sanjeeda kalakaar hai
 i can imagine that after performing and watching this film, their actors must have been troubled
 yah aisi film he jo apane hi nayak ko katghare main khadaa kar detii he
 The mirror shows
 kisi bhi nayak ko apni film main jitate hue dekhnaa hi acha lagata hoga
 i do not know how Akshay would have seen the loss in real life by winning in the film
 maine akshay kumaar ke kalakaar man ke liye tali bajaai he
 The comments 'jolly elelbi-2' ek acchhee film he
 This film has come to talk to the common people
 aam logon ko bhi is film se baaten kerani chahie
 Huma Qureshi enjoyed acting
 huma ke abhinay kii ek khaasiyat he
 She does not act

 His clapping alone in the court room seemed like a possibility
 wo us unmaadi bheed ke saamne khadi hokar tali bajaati he jise sirf rashtrawaad ke naam par kori bhavukta pasand aati he
 There is nothing greater than facts and justice
 prem or yuddh main sabakuch jaays nahin hota he
 Subhash Kapoor has very well introduced the Lucknow craze for the brand in this film
 meri nirdeshak se ek guzarish he
 They should give a gift of Gucci to Huma Qureshi

 i like the acting of Akshay Kumar
 unki eemaandaaree or saahas kaa kaayal ho gaya ki unhone is film ke liye haa kahi
 Media reports show that at times, in the name of nationalism, Akshay Kumar is seen standing with the sentiment of media and politics
 is film main ve usee unmaad ke kilaaf apana sab kuch daanv par lagaate hai or asli zindagi ke apane hi tarkon par cinema kii kahani main jeet hasil karte hai
 Akshay is a serious artist
 kalpana kar saktaa hum ki is film ko karne or dekhne ke baad unke kalakaar man ke chithde ud gaye honge
 This is a film that makes its own hero stand in the dock
 aainaa dikhaa detii he
 It would be nice to see any hero winning in his film
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki film main jeet kar asli zindagi main haar ko akshay ne kaise dekha hoga
 i clapped for Akshay Kumar's artist Mana

 yah film aam logon se baaten karne ai he

 huma kuraishi kaa abhinay acha laga
 Huma's acting is a specialty
 wo abhinay nahin karti hai
 Just like in the story the story itself looks for them
 court room main unka akele tali bajaanaa ek sambhaavna kii tarah laga
 She claps and stands in front of the frenzied crowd, who just likes blatant sentiment in the name of nationalism
 tathyon or insaaf se bada kuch nahin hota
 Everything is not justified in love and war
 subhash kapur ne is film main brands ke liye lakhanu waalon kii sanak ko bahut salike se pesh kiya he
 i have a request from the director
 wo huma kuraishi ko gucchi kaa ek dress tohfe main de hi den
 Because this film is a story of being right on the screen of real life
 isliye kahani bhi asli zindagi main sach ho jaae to mazaa aa jaae

 Not only this, often these things also happen among the people that what would happen like a girls hostel? Here is the answer, here are 10 specials of Girls Hostel: 1
 selfi time:selfi lenaa girls hostel main ladakiyon kaa sabase acha time-paas he
 Sometimes the program of taking a selfie or sometimes in a group keeps on going here
 2
 Relationship Philosophy: Roommate is the biggest emotional support for girls who live far away from home

 3

 makhmali aawaaj vaale mashhoor ghazal gayak pankaj udhaas apni nai peshkash ke saath taiyaar hai
 His new Ghazal album will be released on Sunday at GIP Mall in Noida
 is elbum main sirf ek hi ghazal he or is tarah kii yah sambhavat: pehali elbum he
 It is written by Ghazal poet and lyricist Alok Srivastava
 isi silsile main hamaari pankaj udhaas se baat hui
 He also spoke on the current nature of the Ghazal world with his new offering and shared his years of experiences and memorable tales
 pesh hai baatcheet ke ansh:is elbum ke bare main bataaen
 What was the thought behind bringing the single Ghazal album? It has been a tradition in the Ghazals world to make an album that consists of seven-eight songs
 logon ne puraani gajalon ke cover varjan alag se gaae hai, lekin ek nai ghazal ko 'ghazal single' ke taur par laane kaa tajurba shaayad kisi ne nahin kiya
 The big reason for bringing it as a single was that Alok Bhai has said very good ghazal from a poetic perspective
 iskaa har matla or har sher laajawab he
 So we thought to highlight only one Ghazal
 elbum kaa naam he 'khwaabon kii kahani'
 Is this your chosen name or part of the same ghazal? (the lion reads) 'you are thinking just to cloud flights, i have my eyes on the sun's bases
 ' jaahir taur par yah ghazal sapanom kii kahani he
 Along with this comes a place in an Egyptian, 'there is a long story of broken dreams
 'ghazal ke video ke bare main bataaie
 This video has been directed by Kushal Srivastava, who has been associated with JP Dutta
 vah rajasthan kii prishthbhumi ko parde par ukerne main maahir hai
 Through the landscape of Rajasthan, he has described Ghazal very well
 kuch hissaa barmer main shoot hua he or kumhalgarh main
 Why chose Alok Shrivastav for this ghazal? Actually this whole project is a coincidence
 alok bhai ko kaaphi samay se jaanata hum
 He wrote the title song for a TV show
 unhone mujhase kaha ki aap dhun banaaie or ise gaaie
 We met in Mumbai in this connection
 ham baithe hue baat kar rahe the to alok bhai ne ghazal kaa matla or do-chaar sher sunaae
 i said it should be recorded
 to yaheen se baat shuru hui or ab bahut jald aapke saamne hogi
 Which is closer to your heart in your singing ghazals? This is a difficult question
 kai gajalen hai
 'it is nice to meet the walls and cry' if you want to choose one
 achche mukaam vaale ghazal gayakon main hindustan main aap iklaute hai
 How do you see the ghazal listeners and the current scenario of ghazals? i and my colleagues have tried to understand this very carefully
 hameshaa hi filmi sangeet kaa prabhutv rahaa he
 But there was a time when people like Majrooh Sultanpuri, Sahir and Shailendra used to write songs in films
 yani tab filmi geeton main bhi ghazal or kavita thi
 So our listeners did not make much difference
 phir ek aisa daur aayaa 90 ke baad jab cinema kaa sangeet bhartiya sangeet se dur hota gaya
 Now film music has captured a genre different from ghazals and hymns and qawwalis
 naujavaanon ko ab vahi sab pasand aata he
 Children of the new breed have been disconnected from our music
 doosraa fark jubaan kaa bhi he
 Except Urdu, now the children are getting away from Hindi also
 log din main filmi sangeet sunate honge, lekin raat main jab ishk sataata he to ghazal hi lagaate hai
 (laughs ) haa yahi baat main ek patrkaar mitra se kuch din pehle kah rahaa tha
 If the man gets tired of the pomp, he returns here
 ghazal kaa mukaam nahin khatm hua he
 Today Ghazal may not be the priority, but the first option is there
 is daur main koi aapse film main gane ko kahe, aapke mizaaj kaa koi gaanaa, to gaayenge?jarur gaanaa chaahunga
 But the truth is that there is very little scope left in the current environment
 aapane tamaam sho duniya bhar main kiye hai
 Want to share a memorable anecdote? Yes, there are all stories
 ek baar neuyork ke medisson squaire main program tha
 After the program was to go to the airport
 jinhen lekar janaa tha, unhone gaadi kahin dur park kar di thi
 So it was decided to leave by taxi
 hamane taxi lee
 If we were to reach the airport, we asked the taxi driver to drive a little faster, then what did he say next, 'just walk slowly
 'main hairaan rah gaya kyonki yah to meri gaai ghazal he, 'dard kii barish sahi maddham, jaraa aahista chal
 'so i said if you look like a brother, you are white, you know Hindi? He told that he is Afghan and my fan
 bolaa-'aapke program ke bare main pataa chalaa to raat se yahaan taxi lagaakar baitha hum
 'we got that hug leaving the airport and didn't even take a taxi fare
 elbum 5 july ko dopaher 12 baje noida ke 'da great india pales mal' main relies kii jaaegi

 i welcome them all to the party

 mujhe ummid he ki main sundargarh ke logon ke liye kuch kar paaungi
 She said that she has joined the BJD unconditionally and will accept whatever decision is made by the party chief regarding the ticket

 Tanushree dutta-nana Patekar controversy is in discussion these days
 ye maamla dinondin badhata ja rahaa he
 Many Bollywood celebs have supported Netanushree Dutta
 lekin sadi ke mahanayake or bollywood ke diggaj abhinayttamitabh bachchanane is par golmaal jawaab diya tha
 Tanushree is saddened by this reaction of Big B
 amitabh ne kaha tha- ''naa hi main tanushri datta hum or naa hi naanaa patekar
 So, i cannot comment
 '' hindustan times ne jab tanushri se big bi ke riection par jawaab maanga to unhone kaha, ''main dukhi hum kyonki ye ve log hai jo saamaajik muddon par filmein karte hai
 But when it comes to taking a stand and doing something, his painstaking statements come to the fore
 "kai logon kaa kahana he ki actress ye sab publicity ke liye kar rahi hai
 Speaking on this, Tanushree said, "they are calling it my Bollywood comeback and big boss stunt
 log abhi bhi ye sochate hai ki jo miss univers stage par walk kar chukaa ho, jisane 16-18 bollywood filmon kii ho, jivan main uski aakanksha itani hi simit hogi?"bataa den, tanushri nenaana patekarpar shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He accused Nana of trying to force himself with him during the shooting of a film in 2008
 unhone kaha tha, ''naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 Nowadays, it is the effort of Union Minister Giriraj Singh that the Bihar government be put in the dock on one pretext
 lekin is baar unka yah daanv ulta pad gaya
 On Sunday, Giriraj Singh said in Begusarai, 'I feel like committing suicide after seeing the situation of the flood victims'
 On this, senior leader of Janata Dal United and Minister Shravan Kumar has said that no one has stopped you from doing so? Giriraj On Singh's statement, Shravan Kumar said that suicides are wrongdoing and should not make such a statement
 lekin duniya main agar koi vyakti aatmahatya karne par utaaru ho jaye to use koun roak saktaa he? saath hi jadyu netaa ne kaha ki giriraaj singh sach nahin jaanate kyonki jis rajya main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ek nahin kai baar kaha he ki khajaane par pehla haq aapadaa peediton kaa he, vahaan aise vivaad ko tool nahin dena chahie
 Apart from JDU leader Shravan, Bihar Education Minister Krishnanandan Verma said that Giriraj makes such strange statements only to remain in the headlines
 giriraaj singh ne apane sansadeey kshetra begusarai ke daure ke kai video jari kiye the
 In these videos it was tried to show that not only relief material is not being distributed among the flood affected people but there is a lot of dissatisfaction among the people
 bataa den, giriraaj singh ne begusarai main baadh ke halaat kaa jayja lene ke dauraan ravivaar ko tejada anumandal adhikari nishanth ko fatkaar lagaayi thi
 In fact, Teghda subdivision officer sat in his vehicle during the foot inspection of various flood affected areas of the minister
 naaraaz giriraaj ne teghda anumandal adhikari ke bare main kaha 've bade aadmi hai, gadee se utrenge kaise, babu hai
 After getting off the vehicle, the subdivisional officer reprimanded the Union Minister
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, 'aapaki jitani tarif raste bhar hamane suni he, wo dobaaraa nahin sunen
 Avoid this compliment
 bolte kuch hai or karte kuch hai 
 All the people are speaking against you
 'unhone tejada anumandal adhikari se kaha 'agar is ilaake ke paanch panchayaton ke liye raahat shivi nahin laga to main aapke samaksh dharna duungaa
 We are the people's representative and your responsibility is more than ours
 ' giriraaj ne teghda anumandal adhikari ko chetate hue kaha 'galatfahami main mat rahiye or apane aapako anumandal adhikari ke daayre main rakhen
 ' ab tak duusari raajnneetik partiyon kii ‘kathani or kerani’ ko lekar anguli uthaane vaali aam aadmi party (aap) bhi ab puri tarah se usee raah par chal padi he or party kii kathani or kerani main antar bhi saaf najar aane laga he
 Though there are many examples to prove this, but the most burning case is the transfer of an honest officer and that too when the Aam Aadmi Party is putting the Khattar government of Haryana in the dock on this issue
 aam aadmi party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se haal hi main nikaale gaye professor anand kumaar ne bhi dilli sarkaar dwaara ek eemaandaar chhavi vaale adhikari kaa tabadale kiye jane par sawaal uthaae hai
 Professor Anand Kumar has asked why Kejriwal government transferred him a few days after appointing Ashish Joshi to the post of Secretary, Delhi Dialogue Commission? anand kumaar kii aapatti aise vaqt ai he, jab aam aadmi party ne haryana kii khatter sarkaar par ashok khemka kaa tabadalaa karne par gambhir sawaal uthaae hai
 Professor Anand Kumar has raised questions about this transfer on the Kejriwal government of Delhi on his Facebook page
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ashish joshi dilli dialog kamishan main aam aadmi party ke chah wacentrs (kaaryakartaaon) kii samanvayak ke taur par niyukti ke khilaaf the
 He was also estranged from Ashish Khaitan, chairman of the commission
 sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki ashish joshi is baat se aahat the ki kuch aap wacentrs ne unke offis main ghuskar unase bahesbaazi kii
 When Joshi asked who those people were, you volunteers said that Joshi first asked his boss who he was
 isi vajah se unka transfar kar diya gaya
 Ashish Joshi is a 1992 batch Indian Post and Telecommunication Accounts and Finance Services officer
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik ashish khetaan ne in wacentrs kii niyukti ke liye ashish joshi ko munhajbani kaha tha
 Joshi cited rules that cannot be done
 is baat par vivaad tha or ashish joshi kii chuttee ho gai
 Not only this, it is also news that the government has given a notice to the current Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia, who had given notice as per rules for not vacating the government house on time during the previous term
 is adhikari ne manish sisodiya ko notice tab diya tha, jab unka kaarykaal khatm ho gaya tha or wo samay biit jane ke baavjood sarkari makaan khaali nahin kar rahe the
 Now it seems that no one is probably in need of an honest officer, BJP, Congress or Aam Aadmi Party and all political parties need officers who want to be their own choice
 aise adhikari, jo bos kii ji-hujuri kare
 Of course, like other parties, the Aam Aadmi Party can also do this, but then it does not have the right to lift fingers on Khemka's transfer by citing principles
 sawaal ye uthta he kis party ko chahie eemaandaar adhikari? unhen to aise hi afasar chahie jo unke anuyaayi hon
 Concede everything from the leaders of the party
 agar dekha jaae to is maamle main kisi bhi party kaa record ek-duusare juda nahin he
 It has been 49 days for the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi
 pichhali baar 49 din main hi uski sarkaar gir gai thi
 In those days, a heap of announcements was made, but this time there is nothing like that
 lagata he baari bahumat ke chalate party puri tarah se nishcint he
 Experts believe that now the party feels that it has enough time and there is no one to ask
 vahiin pichhali baar vakt bhi kam tha, bahumat bhi nahin tha or janata ko badha-chadhaakar jhaanki bhi to dikhaani thi
 Yes, the Kejriwal government has given immediate subsidy on electricity and water from the tax payers of Delhi, but has not yet introduced a permanent remedy or formula
 kahaan to bijli companiyon kaa audit karakar bijli ke rate kam karaane kii baaten kii ja rahi thim, parantu ab to bijli companiyaan hi ghate kaa ronaa rokar prati unit teen rupee tak bijli ke daam badhaane kii maang karne lagi hai
 Similarly, there is no other major work that can be counted
 masalan pani kii nai pipe line, nayeescool or college kii baaten, to abhi tak sirf baton main hi hai
 Yes, from the Chief Minister to the Ministers, they have taken big carts from big bungalows, contrary to their earlier stated principles
 haalat ye he ki lokapal movement main shuru hui party jis rajya main sarkaar main he or sarv shaktimaan he vahaan bhi pichley dedh saal se lokayukta nahin he
 The way the party itself has run its Lokpal, it seems that the Lokpal was just a means of gaining power
 iske alaava, mulaayam singh kii sapa, mamata kii tiemasi, prakaash singh badal kii akali dal, naveen patnayak kii bijedy, nitish kii jediu or mayawati kii bispi kii tarah ab aam aadmi party main bas ek hi vyakti kii chalati he
 If someone raises a voice against him and even opens the tongue, then there is no delay in sidelining him
 saarvajanik kshetra kii tel company indian oil corporation (iosi) ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki dollar kii haalia majbootee se use 12 arab rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 Speaking on the occasion of an energy conference in New Delhi, IOC chief Sarthak Bahuria said that the rise in the value of the dollar against the rupee has had a negative impact on the company's debt

 President Barack Obama has said that after several years of recession, the US economy is now improving, but it will take time to recover the losses from the global financial crisis
 neuyark main general electric (jeei) ke sanyantr kaa daura karne ke baad obama ne kaha, arthvyavastha main phir se sudhaar aane laga he
 He said, more than 10 lakh jobs have been created in the last one year and the pace of appointments has increased
 yah hamaare liye utsahvardhak khabar he
 Obama said that although jobs have been created, many people are still looking for work
 unhone kaha ki mujhe maaloom he ki abhi bhi aapke bahut se padosi, dost athwa rishtedaaron ko kaam nahin mila he
 He said that it is a very good thing that the economy is improving, but its pace is not fast and it will take a long time to recover the losses due to recession
 unhone kaha ki pichley do saal to arthvyavastha ko tut ke kagaar se waapas laane main lag gaye or ab agle do saal main america dekhenge ki arthvyavstha teji se daudane lagi he
 Obama said, "our job is to do everything so that businessmen get work opportunities and people get good employment and after that America gets ahead in the world competition, so that we can have success in the 21st century

 The number of people killed in this accident has reached 142
 kareeb chah saal pehle bengal main 28 may 2010 ko hue aise hi bheeshan rail haadase main 148 log maare gaye the
 Investigations have been ordered even after the rail accident at Pukhrayan near Kanpur, as has happened after every accident
 shuruaati jaanch main sanket mili hai ki railway trek kii kharabi ke chalate yah haadasa hua hoga
 The driver's report has revealed negligence
 vaise to hamaare desh main har saal kai choti-badi train durghatnaayen hoti rahati hai or inamen 86 fisadi haadase maanviya bhuulon kii vajah se hote hai
 But there is no denying the fact that despite being the third largest rail system in the world after the US and China, the Indian Railways still operates on the infrastructure of the British era
 jis hisaab se patariyon par railway trephic kaa dabaav bad rahaa he, us hisaab se infrastakchar apgrade nahin ho paa rahaa he
 On one hand, the government is planning to run bullet trains, on the other hand the government has failed to save normal trains from accidents due to lack of change in infrastructure
 railway ke saamne sefti ek bada masalaa bana hua he
 Accidents in the signaling system and lack of anti-collision devices also cause accidents

 This is not a new incident of rail accident due to lack of infrastructure
 kareeb 35 saal pehle bihar main ek bheeshan rail haadasa hua tha jisamen kareeb 800 log maare gaye the

 About 200 dead bodies were removed from the river 5 days after the incident but the bodies of the remaining passengers were not even found
 bataaya jaataa he ki inaki laashen nadi kii tej dhara main bah gai hongi
 It was said that the flood water had reached the tracks due to which the train became a victim of the accident
 yani 35 saal pehle bhi railway moolbhoot dhaancha aisa tha jaisaa tamaam jagahon par aaj bhi he

 Banking is the lifeline of the economy and is set to grow in the coming days
 yah tay he ki swasth banking se hi desh kii arthvyavastha bhi badhegi
 Jaitley said that if banks focus only on commercial and retail markets, then banks will enjoy seeing their accounts, but banks also have to fulfill social responsibility and provide banking facilities in remote areas
 unhone kaha ki gaanv se lekar baari udyog tak bainkon ko jimmedaari uthaani hogi
 Manmohan said - believe Modi, his finance minister also said that surplus cash has its own cost in the economy and India is slowly moving towards digital transactions
 unhone kaha ki desh main spasht rup se ek badlaav ho rahaa he or digital bhugtan ko apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Arun Jaitley said that some people have difficulty accepting the fact that digital transactions registered faster growth than cash transactions
 unhone kaha, 'nakadi par bahut zyada nirbharta kii apni laagtein hai
 It not only costs, but is also a curse for society and economy
 'vitt mantri ne kaha ki desh main spasht rup se ek badlaav ho rahaa he or digital bhugtan ko apanaaya ja rahaa he
 This will not only happen suddenly but the movement towards a low cash economy is evident
 unhone kaha ki isse bainkon main jamaayen badhengi ve sasti daron par karj dene main sakasham honge
 Let us know that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ban on November 8 last year, and removed the prevailing currency notes of 500 and 1000 rupees
 ise kaale dhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ke sarkari prayaas bataaya gaya
 Since then, the central government has been promoting digital payments and transactions, so that the country can move towards a less cash-driven economy
 vahiin vipakshi dalon ne notebandi kii aalochana kii he or unki 8 november ko desh bhar main kaala diwas manaane kii yojana he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne congress mukt bharat ke naare ke saath desh kii raajnneeti main aisi lakeer khinchi he, jisamen centre se lekar desh ke rajyon tak bijepi hi bijepi najar aa rahi he
 In such difficult times, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is desperate to make his place in the country's politics
 rahul pichley kuch saalon se kisaanon ke sahare apni siyaasi jameen talash rahe hai
 In fact, as the wind of the country's politics is blowing, it is believed that Rahul's only farmer vote bank is such a safe pocket through which Rahul can stand in front of Modi
 rahul modi sarkaar ko sootboot vaali sarkaar bataate rahete hai or corporate ke hitaishi kaa tamgaa bhi de chuke hai
 Explain that during the Congress-led UPA-1 government, the debt of farmers was waived
 rahul isi aadhaar par samay-samay par modi sarkaar se samuhik kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii baat uthaate rahete hai
 He keeps saying that when the government can forgive the debts of the industrialists, why not the debt of the farmers? Rahul reached Nanded farmers of Maharashtra on Friday and said that the country is forced to commit suicide today
 pichley teen saal main maharashtra ke 9 hajaar kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the country also needs farmers
 rahul ne kaha ki desh ko udyogpatiyon kii jarurat he, lekin desh ko kisaanon kii bhi jarurat he
 The country cannot run only with the help of entrepreneurs
 darasal rahul kisaanon ke bich pehali baar nahin utre hai
 During the Mayawati government in Uttar Pradesh, the issue of Bhatta Parsaul was raised
 jahaan jameen adhigrahan ke virodh main kisaanon kaa andolan chal rahaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi arrived there on a motorcycle
 jabaki police ne bhatta parsul gaanv ko chaaron taraf nakaabandi kar rakhi thi
 Even after this, Rahul was able to reach among the farmers
 rahul gandhi pichley saal josh or umang ke saath kisaanon kii ladaai ko takat ke saath ladane ke liye kai rajyon kaa daura kiya tha
 He did hikes across the country from north to south in the scorching sun
 rahul ne punjab se paidal yatra shuru kii or phir maharashtra ke vidarbha or telugana main, kerala main machuaaron kii samasya ko lekar padayatra kii thi
 Rahul went to the homes of farmers suffering from unseasonal rains, heavy rains and hailstorms, who committed suicide due to some reason after the natural calamity
 jantar-mantar par baithe tamilnadu ke kisaanon ke bich bhi rahul gandhi pahunche the
 When the Modi government was going to amend the land acquisition bill, Rahul came on the road
 rahul uttar pradesh ke aligarh jile ke tappal gaanv main bhi gaye the, jahaan kisaan jameen adhigrahan ke khilaaf andolan kar rahe the
 After this, the Modi government had to pull back
 rahul ne upi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle 2500 kimi kii kisaan yatra kiya tha
 He used to do Khat Sabha among farmers
 desh bhar ke kisaanon par ek report bhi rahul ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko saunpi tha or kaha tha ki kisaanon ke karj maaf karen
 Rahul is constantly trying to build a direct relationship with the common man by breaking his aristocratic image
 rahul gandhi kisaanon or mazdooron kii ladaai ke jariye congress party ko nae sire se khadaa karne main jute hai
 There is a continuous ceasefire violation from Pakistan on the border in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahiin pakistan hi baatcheet kii pahal bhi kar rahaa he
