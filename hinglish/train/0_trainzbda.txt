 twitor par post kiye gaye is video kii taraf yah dhyaan dilaae jane par ki isamen jet vimaan vastav main pakistani vimaan hai, video ko hataa liya gaya
 The first part of this one-minute video of the Ministry of Culture on "70 Years of Independence" featured two jf-17s with Indian tricolor in order of animation
 ek sarkari sutara ne bataaya ki yah anjaane main hui ek chook thi kyonki jeef-17 bharat ke halke ladaaku vimaan tejas jaisaa dikhataa he or ek aam naagarik ke liye donon vimaan main antar kar paanaa mushkil he
 However, upon realizing the mistake, it was immediately lifted
 jeef-17 ko pakistan or china dwaara milakar viksit kiya gaya he or donon hi desh vaishvik str par aapurti kaa order hasil karne ke liye is vimaan ko kaaphi protsaahit kar rahe hai
 The comments dilachasp he ki jeef-17 ke liye baatcheet karne vaale desh srilanka ne is vimaan ko khaarij kar diya he or ab uski najar tejas par he

 a government source said this was an unintentional omission as the JF-17 resembles India's light combat aircraft Tejas and it is difficult for a common citizen to distinguish between the two aircraft
 haalanki, galati kaa ehsaas hone par ise turant hataa liya gaya
 The JF-17 has been developed jointly by Pakistan and China and both countries are strongly encouraging this aircraft to get the order of supply globally

 Dhoni has told that he has reached such heights in life only by the grace of Goddess Durga
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki jis shaks kaa har faisla itnaa tark aadhaarit hota he, vah itnaa dharmik kaise ho saktaa he ki kabhi-kabhi pashubali se bhi gurej na kare

 dhoni england or australia main sharmnaak haar or phir apane hi desh main england ke haathon test siries or pakistan se vanade siries haarane ke baad bhi captaini bachaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 With this, he has proved that no one has the power to put his hands up
 mahaarathiyon ko maffksar badi jeet ke liye tarasane vaale desh ko dhoni ne pehla world tii20 champion banaaya, use australia main vanade siries main durlabh jeet dilaai, srilanka ko pehali baar usee kii dharti par vanade siries main maat di, desh ko test rekking main number van banaaya or sabase badhkar 28 saal baad desh ko vishwa cap kaa tohfa diya

 According to sources, Laxman had announced his plans to retire despite being selected in the New Zealand Test series, as according to sources, Dhoni had forced him to make such an announcement
 bataate hai, dhoni ne unke saamne shart rakhi thi ki ve siries se pehle ritair hone kii yojana kii ghoshnaa karen, varanaa unhen team se nikaal diya jayega
 Laxman made the case even more suspicious by saying that he could not talk to Dhoni over the phone
 thik usee hafte unhone team india ke sadasyon ko apane ghar dinar par bulaayaa or mehmaanon kii suchi main dhoni kaa naam nahin tha
 Sachin Tendulkar also suddenly announced to retire from odis, while the team was going to be selected for the series against Pakistan a few moments later

 Of all the potential captains drafted under Dhoni's captaincy, only Gambhir has managed to retain his place in all formats of the game

 , the biggest contender for Test captaincy — as Mohinder Amarnath, who was left out of the selection committee, revealed in December — has been ruled out of the first three odis against England
 purv chayan samiti ke tahat dhoni ke sabase tagade pratidwandvi gautam gambhir team main apni jagah sahi sabit karne ke liye jaddojahad karte najar aa rahe hai
 Soon after losing the Test series to Australia and being considered for the first time by the selectors to change the captaincy, Dhoni played Tendulkar, Sehwag and Gambhir in turn during the ODI tour of Australia during february-march 2012
 Started his famous experiment
 iske kuch hi din baad bangladesh main hone vaale asia cap main sahvaag ko team se baahar kar diya gaya or gambhir kii up-captaini chin lee gai
 Suddenly Virat Kohli was given the charge of vice-captaincy
 sutron kaa kahana he, yah ek sochi-samajhi chaal thi ki dhoni kii captaini ko kisi tarah kaa khatra na ho kyonki kohli us vakt captaini ke liye bahut yuva the
 Sources in the one-man selection committee say that Dhoni is a one-man selection committee
 yah baat isi ek udhaaharan se sabit ho jaati he ki 2011 main england ke khilaaf siries ke dauraan kis tarah aadhi-adhuri taiyaari vaale aar
 P
 singh ko daure ke bich main hi test team main shaamil kar liya gaya tha yaa kis tarah piyush chawla kuch khaas na kar paane ke baavjood team main aate-jate rahe hai yaa kis tarah rabindra jadeja ekaek sabhi farmet main jagah paa jate hai
 Former spinner Maninder Singh says, "the problem is that Dhoni has rarely played domestic cricket and he doesn't know the players properly
 isliye ve kuch hi khiladinnon ko baar-baar mauka dete rahete hai
 Insiders say that Srinivasan is Dhoni's real strength, who gives him full support
 bhartiya cricket main is tarah kaa samarthan koi nai baat nahin he
 The captain and chief administrator also had a strong relationship between Ganguly and Jagmohan Dalmiya
 iskaa phayda ganguli ko mila
 But what will happen after September 2014, when Srinivasan will hand over the BCCI rein to one of his successors? The World Cup is to be held in february-march 2015, will Srinivasan and Dhoni pair decide the future of Team India at that time too? Will Dhoni be able to save the cup won after a tough struggle? It is unlikely that Dhoni's fairy tale will have a major twist

 Currently, this sequence has not been delivered to the audience through the promo, but the rumor has started between the audience as well as Ayushman and Pooja regarding this scene

 Nautanki Sala has a two-minute lip lock kissing scene
 jahaan is seen ko lekar ayushmaan khurana kaa kahana he ki unhone ise mahaz ek seen kii tarah kiya vahiin puja kaa kahana he, ‘film main mere or ayushmaan ke bich filmaaye gayi is lip lock kising seen ko mahaz glamer ke liye nahin rakhaa gaya he balki yah script kii demand thi
 Both me and Ayushmann are quite introverted by nature, so it was very difficult for us to do this scene
 lekin film main hamaare kaaphi seens saath saath hai so is seen ke dauraan hamen thodi hichkichaahat kam hui
 Apart from Pooja, the film's director Rohan Sippy says, "this scene is the turning point of the film, so we shot this scene at the very end
" is seen kii ek khaasiyat yah bhi he ki isamen pehali baar koi aurat aage badhakar kisi purush ko lip lock kis kar rahi he

 After two-thirds majority for BJP in Uttar Pradesh, BJP parliamentary board meeting was held in Delhi on Sunday with CM face
 baithak main upi ke liye paryvekshak ke taur par venkaiya naidu or bhupendra yadav ke naam par muhar lagi he
 Apart from this, it has been decided in the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party that the legislative party of UP will meet on 16 March
 usee din upi ke agle siem kii ghoshnaa bhi hogi
 bjp's Parliamentary Board has authorized Amit Shah to talk to the rest of the members and decide the name of the Chief Minister
 mana ja rahaa he ki aakhri pasand par piem modi kii rajamandi ke baad hi muhar lagegi
 Amit Shah met Rajnath In this episode, Amit Shah met Rajnath Singh at his residence today
 amit shah or rajnath singh ke bich mukalaat se kya niklaa, iskaa abhi tak khulaasa nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, the names of Rajnath Singh are also included in the race for the post of Chief Minister
 isse pehle bhi wo soobe kii kaman sambhaal chuke hai 
 Along with the tall leader, his image is clean
 haalanki rajnath singh ne is bare main abhi tak koi pratikriya nahin di he
 These two names are according to the cm's race sources, two names are currently being discussed in BJP as CM faces in UP
 jin naamon kii charchaa he unamem pehla naam desh ke grih mantri rajnath singh kaa or doosraa naam bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury kaa he
 Rajnath Singh: The name of veteran Netrajnath Singh is also discussed in full swing because a meeting between Amit Shah and the Home Minister was held on Sunday
 haalanki mulaakaat kaa agenda abhi tak saaf nahin hua he par kayaas yahi lagaae ja rahe hai ki shah vahaan rajnath singh kaa paksh jaanane gaye the
 BJP does not want to take any risk in UP, that is why it is taking steps thoughtfully
 yahi vajah he ki party rajnath singh ke naam par daanv khelnaa chaahati he
 Because Rajnath Singh is a senior and senior politician of the party
 iske alaava rajnath singh pehle bhi upi kii satta sambhaal chuke hai
 Kalyan's throne was held to remind you that Rajnath Singh took over the throne of bjp's first Chief Minister Kalyan Singh in UP
 haalanki kalyaan or rajnath singh ke bich ram prakaash gupt kaa bhi 351 din kaa kaarykaal tha
 However, power was not taking over from the Guptas due to which the party handed over the reins of the state to Rajnath Singh on 28 October 2000
 saaf jaahir he ki upi jaisaa bada rajya sanbhaalanaa sabake bas ke baahar he
 Maybe this is the reason that BJP is once again trying to play bets on its old leader
 behatar shashanrajnath singh ne apane mukhyamantri kaal main kalyaan singh kii tarah hi satta kii bagdor kasi rakhi
 Along with this, he also started a scheme like Kisan Credit Card for the farmers of the state, for which he was highly praised
 nishkantak hoga modi kaa safarabijepi main philvakt narendra modi jaisaa kad kisi kaa nahin he
 But, people see Rajnath Singh as the number two in BJP
 agar rajnath singh upi kii satta sambhalate hai to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko party main number do ke taur koi or nahin hoga kyonki rajnath ke baad sabase taqatvar mantriyon main arun jetali hai jo unke kheme ke hi maane jate hai
 Keshav Prasad Maurya: As the next CM of the organization's strength, the second number is discussed by Keshav Prasad Maurya
 upi main yah chunaav bijepi ne keshav prasad maury ke hi netritv main ladaa tha to is jeet kaa shrey unhen bhi jaataa he
 In such a situation, the BJP can make them CM and also give the message that 'whatever they do will be found'
 keshav lambey samay se sangh se jude rahe hai
 Keshav Prasad Maurya joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh since childhood
 keshav sangh se bal swayamsevak ke taur par jude the
 Later Keshav Prasad has also worked for Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal
 keshav prasad vishwa hindu parishad ke liye 12 saal tak kaam karte rahe, ve viechpi netaa ashok singhl ke khaas maane jate the
 Due to his speeches, Keshav has also been jailed during the Ayodhya and Gau Raksha movement
 keshav ne bhi bechi he chiapako bataa den ki keshav prasad maury kaushambi jile ke ek kisaan ghar main paidaa hue hai
 He spent his childhood in poverty
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii hi tarah keshav prasad maury ne bhi apane parivaar kii madad ke liye chaay bechi he or akhbaar bhi baante hai
 This takes Keshav very close to Modi's image
 amit shah ke khaskeshav prasad maury ko amit shah kaa khaas mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that despite the presence of many senior leaders of UP, the party came into their hands
 aapako bataa den ki keshav prasad maury 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main elahabaad kii shirathu vidhansabha seat se vidhayak chune gaye the
 In 2014, he was elected as an MP from Phulpur Lok Sabha seat
 april 2016 main keshav prasad maury ko 2017 main vidhansabha chunaavon ko jeetne kii jimmedaari dete hue upi bijepi kii satta saunpi gai
 By giving message to the backward class, the power of UP BJP can try to help the backward class of the state
 obisi vot sapa kaa kor vot rahaa he, taaja chunaav parinaamon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kuch had tak bijepi is vot bank main send lagane main safal rahi he
 BJP can make Keshav the CM and give a clear message to this class that his future is safe and bright even in BJP rule
 in donon chehron ke alaava in naamon kii bhi he charchaa

 com / dhyklqgkzk bajet bhaashan ke dauraan asaamaanya sthiti dekhne ko mili
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley took a five-minute break in the Lok Sabha's 2014-15 budget speech for a while
 mantri ke anurodh ko sweekaar karte hue loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne paanch minute kaa brake diya
 After giving a 40-minute speech, the Finance Minister looked a bit tired and after that he requested a break
 sadan kii kaarywahi phir se shuru hone ke baad loksabhaa adhyaksh ne kaha ki mantri thodaa aswasthy mahasoos kar rahe the, isliye viraam diya gaya
 After that, he gave permission to sit and read the budget
 loksabhaa sutron ke anusaar 61 varshiya mantri ko peeth main dard kii bhi shikaayat thi
 He was seen leaning towards the table
 isse pehle, unhen bajet bhaashan ke dauraan unhen baar-baar pani pite dekha gaya
 This is probably the first time the Budget speech has come to a halt
 trainon main varisht nagarikon ko die ja rahe cote par durupyog kii shikaayat milane par rail prashasan kii najar ab tedi ho gai he
 The new rule will apply to prevent misuse in the name of quota of senior citizens
 varisht nagarikon ko ab tikat booking ke dauraan umr kaa pramaan dena hoga
 Ticket reservation will be done only on showing proof koi yatri agar galat pramaan dikhaata he to uski arakshit berth nirast kar di jaaegi
 It is worth noting that till now no age certificate had to be given on the purchase of any railway reservation center or online ticket in the railway
 varisht naagarik ke liye loar berth bhi canform ho jaati thi
 Along with this, men get 40 percent fare if they are above 60 years and 50 percent for women above 58 years of age
 tippaniyan Senior citizens were required to show their age certificate during the journey
 aise main yatri aarakshan karaate samay apni umr ko galat darshaakar varisht naagarik cote kaa laabh le lete the
 If the TTY caught up during the journey, the passengers would have survived by paying a fine
 itnaa hi nahin, aayu praaanpatr na dikhaa paane kii sthiti main yatriyon se diference fere vasuul kar use seat de di jaati thi, jisase rail rajasav kaa nuksaan hota tha or seat bhi jaruratmand ko nahin mil paati thi
 The Railway Board has now tightened the rules on receiving complaints of misuse by passengers in this quota
 railway board ke nae niyam ke anusaar, ab tikat to pehle kii tarah hi book karaayaa ja sakegaa or yatra ke dauraan hi aayu praaanpatr dena hoga
 If the passenger could not give the age certificate, he would now be considered as bettik
 railway ab aise yatriyon se bina tikat kaa hi jurmaana vasulegaa
 Also, his seat will also be canceled
 railway board ne nae niyam kaa aadesh iarsitisi or kris ko bhi bhej diya he
 According to senior railway officials, this decision has been taken to provide more facilities to senior citizens and to save the Railways from revenue loss

 According to senior railway officials, this decision has been taken to provide more facilities to senior citizens and to save the Railways from revenue loss
 gauratlab he ki railway main abhi tak kisi bhi rail aarakshan centre yaa online tikat kii kharid par koi bhi aayu praaanpatr nahin dena padataa tha
 Lower berths for senior citizens were also confirmed
 iske saath hi yatra main purushon ko 60 varsh se adhik hone par 40 pratishat or mahilaon ko 58 varsh se upar hone par 50 pratishat kii kiraaye main chhot milti he
 The comments yatra ke dauraan varisht nagarikon ko apana aayu praaanpatr dikhaanaa hota tha
 In such a situation, while taking reservation, senior citizens used to take advantage of the quota by showing their age incorrectly
 yatra ke dauraan agar titii pakad letaa tha to yatri jurmaana dekar batch jate the
 Not only this, in the event of not showing the age certificate, the differential fair was collected from the passengers and they were given seats, causing loss of railway revenue and the seat was not available to the needy
 is cote main yatriyon ke dwaara durupyog hone kii shikaayat milane par railway board ne ab niyam kade kar die hai
 According to the new rules of Railway Board, now tickets can be booked as before and an age certificate will have to be given during the journey itself
 yadi yatri aayu praaanpatr na de sakaa to use ab betikat mana jayega
 Railways will now collect fine without such tickets from such passengers
 saath hi uski seat bhi nirast kar degaa
 The Railway Board has also sent the order of the new rule to IRCTC and CRIS
 railway ke varisht adhikariyon ke anusaar, varisht nagarikon ko adhik suvidha dene or railway ko rajasav haani se bachaane ke liye yah nirnay kiya gaya he

 congress netaa jagadish titalar or jail main band hathiyaar dealer abhishek verma par sibiai ne aaropapatr daayar kiya
 In 2009, a charge sheet was filed against him for allegedly forgery of the letterhead of the then Minister of State for Home Ajay Maken
 agency ne praathmiki main titalar kaa naam aaropee ke taur par nahin rakhaa he lekin sibiai kii adaalat main daayar aaropapatr main isane unka naam shaamil kiya he or aarope lagaaya he ki congress netaa ke saath verma ‘‘kii mileebhagat se farjivada’’ kiya gaya
 The comments jaanch se parichit sibiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘farjivada kiye gaye patr ko china kii ek doorsanchaar company ko diya gaya jiskaa uddeshy unhen galat tareeke se aashwast karnaa tha ki bharat main unki vija avadhi bad jaaegi
 Verma showed the letter and allegedly demanded a million dollars from the company but the money was not transacted
 ’ maakan kii shikaayat par sibiai ne verma ke khilaaf pichley varsh bhadansan kii dhara 469 ke tahat maamla darj kiya tha jo chhavi kharaab karne ke uddeshy se kii gai dhokhadhadi se sambandhit he
 Tytler denied the allegations against him, saying, 'this is all nonsense

 There is no truth in it
 ’ yah poochne par ki farjivade main sakriy rup se unki sanliptata thi to titalar ne kaha, ‘kaise? mujhe nahin maaloom ki ve kya kah rahe hai
 Ajay Maken has made this complaint? It is election time
 ’ unhone kaha ki agency ne soochna praudyogiki adhinium or bhrashtachar nirodhak adhinium ke ulanghan kaa bhi maamla darj kiya he
 The agency has not named Tytler as an accused in the FIR but it has included his name in the charge sheet filed in the CBI court alleging that Verma was "forged" in connivance with the Congress leader
 tippaniyan a CBI official familiar with the investigation said, "the fraudulent letter was given to a telecom company in China intended to falsely assure them that their visa period in India would be extended
" verma ne patr dikhaakar company se kathith rup se das lakh dollar kii maang kii lekin dhan kaa len-dein nahin hua
 On the complaint of Maken, the CBI had registered a case against Verma last year under Section 469 of the IPC relating to fraud done for the purpose of tarnishing the image
 titalar ne apane khilaaf aaropon se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘yah sab bakawaas he
 i have come to know about it
 isamen koi sachai nahin he
 "asked if he was actively involved in the fraud, Tytler said," How? i do not know what they are saying
 yah shikaayat ajay maakan ne kii he? yah chunaav kaa vakt he
 He said that the agency has also registered a case of violation of the Information Technology Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act
 jaanch se parichit sibiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘farjivada kiye gaye patr ko china kii ek doorsanchaar company ko diya gaya jiskaa uddeshy unhen galat tareeke se aashwast karnaa tha ki bharat main unki vija avadhi bad jaaegi

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has said on the comments of former army chief VK Singh that the allegations cannot be ignored, their investigation is needed
 umr ne kaha ki sena ke saath vittiya len-dein nahin he

 Last week, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar had said in Jaipur that the country would no longer tolerate terrorism and would not tolerate it as the Defense Minister himself
 parrikar ne kaha, 'aatankwaadi hamalon ko lekar desh kii sahansheeltaa khatm ho chuki he or ek raksha mantri hone ke naate meri bhi sahanshakti khatm ho gai he
 We will do something for this, you keep watching
 ' parrikar ne ye bhi kaha tha ki jab tak pakistan khud apano ko khone kaa dard mahasoos nahin karata, use hamaara dard samaj nahin aayega

 On December 4 last year, Jayalalithaa had a heart attack and died on the next day i
e
 December 5 at Apollo Hospital
 saans lene main takalif kii shikaayat ke baad unhen 22 sitambar ko apollo aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 a look at the journey of Jayalalithaa's life
 
 
 - jayalalita kaa abhinetri se mukhyamantri banane tak kaa safar utaar chadhaav se bharaa rahaa
 Jayalalithaa was close to AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran aka MGR
 unhone apane chaar dashak ke raajnneetik jivan main kaaphi utaar chadhaav dekhe
 Jayalalithaa, who started her film career at the age of 15, became a well-known Tamil actress
 ek vidhyaarthee ke taur par bhi padhai main unki kaaphi ruchi rahi
 AIDMK will pay tribute to Jayalalitha by organizing rally, 4000 police forces deployed - Jayalalithaa worked in 28 films with MGR
 mjiaar tamil cinema ke superstar the or bhartiya raajnneeti ke sammanit netaaon main the
 Jayalalithaa entered politics with MGR saying goodbye to the film world
 kaha jaataa he ki angreji main unki majbootee ko dekhakar mjiaar unako raajnneeti main lekar aae the
 MGR formed AIADMK after m Karunanidhi's party broke away with DMK
 saal 1983 main mjiaar ne jayalalita ko party kaa sachiv niyukt kiya or rajyasabha ke liye manonith kiya
 Meanwhile, there were reports of differences between Jayalalithaa and MGR but Jayalalithaa led the party's campaign in 1984
 -mjiaar kii antim yatra ke dauraan mjiaar kii patni or samarthakon ne jayalalita ke saath kathith rup se durvyavhaar kiya jisase party main bikharaav kii sthiti utpann ho gai
 After Jayalalithaa's death, 77 people lost their lives: AIADMK: Jayalalithaa became the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the first time in 1991 after gaining a strong hold among the public
 -haalanki saal 1996 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 But by then Jayalalithaa had become a strong political figure
 aay se adhik sampatti rakhane ke liye jayalalita par cese chalaa jisamen wo doshi bhi pai gayi
 Finally, on 27 September 2014, a Bangalore court sentenced Jayalalithaa to four years imprisonment
 -jayalalita ko marina bich par unke raajnneetik guru mjiaar ke paas hi dafnaaya gaya tha
 The reasoning behind this was his association with the Dravidian movement
 dravid andolan hindu dharm ke kisi brahmanvaadi parampara or rasm main yakeen nahin rakhata
 Jaya was the head of a Dravidian party whose foundation was laid to protest against Brahminism
 -mjiaar ko bhi unki maut ke baad dafnaaya gaya tha
 Near his tomb is also the tomb of Annadurai, the great leader of the Dravidian movement and the founder of DMK, Annadurai was the first Dravidian Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu

 is hafte kii shuruuaat main prithvi vigyaan mantralay main sachiv em rajivan ne kaha tha ki 30 may tak monsoon ke aagaman ke liye anukool paristhitiyaan hai

 mumbai main barish or jalairao kii samasyaon ke bich ye haadasa hua tha
 Many people were sleeping on the lower floor during the accident
 is haadase main 19 logon kii maut hui thi, jabaki 34 log ghayal ho gaye
 The last round of campaigning for the 17th Lok Sabha ended on 17 May and the same day Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned to the media and confidently claimed to return to the government
 19 may ko jab tamaam agsit pole ke anumaan aae to pradhanmantri modi kaa aatmavishvaas ek majboot sachai kii jhalak detaa dikhaai diya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership in the poll of Aaj Tak and Axis My India, the most trusted exit poll of the country, does not see any challenge far and wide
 bijepi kii aguwai vaale endie ko 543 siton main 339 se 365 siten milane kaa anumaan he jabaki khud bijepi ko hi 293 se 316 siten mil sakati hai
 If these assumptions turned into reality, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will once again be the biggest face of the changing politics of power in the 21st century
 lekin agsit pole ke kuch anumaan aise bhi hai jo na sirf bijepi ko itihaas rachane se roak sakate hai, balki congress ke graph ko nimnatam str par bhi laa sakate hai
 Exit poll estimates on 78 seats have revealed the fact that the contest is going to be tough in 78 Lok Sabha seats across the country
 haalanki, in siton main se zyaadaatar par bijepi yaa uske sahyogi dal aage najar aa rahe hai
 According to the exit poll, the NDA (33 BJP, 4 coalition parties) was leading in 37 out of the tuffed seats, while in 17 seats the UPA is heavy
 inamen 4 siton par congress kii sahyogi partiyaan aage hai, jabaki 13 par congress khud lead kar rahi he
 Apart from these two major parties, candidates for the remaining seats like Trinamool Congress, TDP, YSR, BJD, BSP and CPIM are the most popular candidates
 mahaj 3 fisadi vot kaa antardilachasp baat ye he ki in sabhi 78 siton par vijayi pratyaashee or duusare number par rahane vaale pratyaashee ke bich mahaj 3 fisadi vot kaa antar najar aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, this small difference can prove to be decisive for any party, which can have a big impact on the results
 pehali tasviir-jin 33 siton par bijepi aage najar aa rahi he, agar un sabhi par use haar milti he to bijepi kaa aankada girakar 285 siton tak pahunch jayega
 If this happens, the BJP will easily reach an absolute majority
 kade mukaable main congress jin 13 siton par aage chal rahi he, agar wo jitati he to congress kaa graph thodaa bad jayega, lekin agar congress harati he to uski sankhya 38 tak pahunch jaaegi, jo 2014 ke 44 number se bhi neeche hogi
 That is, the Congress will reach the lowest level of its history
 duusari tasviir-agar bijepi in sabhi 33 siton par bhi jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahati he to vah itihaas rach degi or apane dam 300 kaa aankada paar karte hue 318 siton tak pahunch jaaegi
 This will be the first time since 1984 that a party will cross 300 on its own
 upi-bengal kaa kya haalakade mukaable vaali in siton ko upi or bengal jaise rajya ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to yahaan 24 siton par taff fite najar aa rahi he
 According to exit poll estimates, while there is a contest between the BJP and the Grand Alliance in UP, there is a tuff fight between the BJP and TMC in Bengal
 upi main mahagathbandhan or bijepi saat-saat siton par aage hai
 The interesting thing is that if the Grand Alliance loses even these seven seats, then its victory will be reduced to a single number and the BJP will stand up to its claim of 73+
 vahiin, bengal main paanch siton par tiemasi bijepi se aage chal rahi he
 If TMC loses on these seats, BJP will have a tremendous entry in Bengal
 baharhaal, ye tamaam agsit pole ke anumaan hai
 How the estimates turn into real results, this picture will be clear on May 23, but the situation that has emerged from the exit poll is very interesting

 Like other children of Punjab, Ashk used to dream of becoming a teacher, writer, editor, speaker, lawyer, actor, director and went to theater and film since childhood
 bie paas karte hi upendranath ashk apane hi skool main adhyaaapak ho gaye par, 1933 main use chhod diya
 After some time he joined the weekly paper 'bhukhaal' to earn a living

 From 1948 to 1953, there was conflict in the life of Ashk couple
 par inhen dinon premuchandottar katha sahitya ke vishisht kathakaar upendranath ashk kaa janm hua
 This polytheistic creator of hindi-urdu left the clutches of Yakshma and took refuge from Mumbai to Allahabad

 It is here that he wrote a story, novel, essay, article, memoir, criticism, drama, drama, poetry, etc
 pehle vah urdu main likh rahe the
 Two of his story collections had been published in Urdu, 'nav-ratna' and 'aurat ki Fitrit', but on the advice of Munshi Premchand, 'ashk' started writing in Hindi
 1933 main prakashit unke duusare kahani sangrah 'aurat kii fitrat' kii bhoomika munshi premachand ne hi likhi thi
 When Hindi's first collection, 'judai Ki Sham Ka Geet' was printed in 1933, most of its stories were already published in Urdu
 ashk ji ne khud bhi mana tha ki 1936 ke pehle kii unki kritiyaan ausat thim
 But after 1936, Ashk returned to his youth

 Fahmida Riaz: The poem, which was called India's agent in Pakistan, was different from the second incident, but it was fun
 ashk ji ne aarthik halaaton ko majboot karne ke lihaaj se parchun kii dukaan kholi
 The media at that time took a lot of interest in politics as well as in the literary arena
 so khabar chhapi ki ashk kaa lekhan-prakaashan se moh bhang ho gaya he or vah parchun bech rahe
 In the era of translation, typing and teleprinter, when the groceries became lime and the groceries were transformed into lime shops, mixed with lime and then it also got water

 Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav has always inspired different kinds of emotions in Bihar
 unke naam se unke samarthakon main pyaar umad padataa he to virodhiyon main ghabrahat paidaa hoti he or kuch netaaon ke liye to ve ek avasar kii tarah hai jo pappu ke jabardast prabhaav ko bhunaanaa chaahate hai
 When Patna High Court acquitted him in the murder case of MLA Ajit Sarkar, 48-year-old Pappu Yadav came out of Beur Jail on May 22, where he was imprisoned since he was convicted in 2008
 Were being punished ab unhone yah paaya ki unke aasapaas kii duniya do khemon main banty hui he
 He was surrounded by his friends as he walked out, while his opponents accused the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that Pappu Yadav was acquitted due to his negligent investigation
 maare gaye vidhayak ajit sarkaar kii patni madhavi sarkaar ne kaha ki ve is rihaai ke khilaaf supreme court main apil karengi, lekin pappu yadav ke mitron or dushmano ke alaava bihar ke rajnatik diggaj unki rihaai par puri tarah se chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Pappu too has not opened his political cards, although he stated that his strategy would be to 'awaken the youth'
 pappu yadav 1990 main sirf 25 varsh kii umr main hi vidhayak ban gaye the or iske baad unhone 1991, 1996 or 1999 main teen baar purniya loksabhaa seat par jeet hasil kii
 Pappu Yadav, who had a good influence in Seemanchal and Kosi areas, won from Madhepura in 2004
 1990 se 2004 ke apane 14 saal ke chote se rajnatik kariyar main pappu ne chah baar chunaav ladaa he or isamen se paanch baar vijayi hue hai
 From the equation that is being created in Bihar politics, it seems that Janata Dal United (JDU) can come up with Pappu Yadav to tackle bjp's powerful MP uday Singh from Purnia
 vaise to udai singh mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke bharosemand en
 K
 singh ke bhai hai, lekin jediu purniya ke is saansad se tab se khafa he, jab unhone pichley saal bihar main achche prashasan ke mukhyamantri ke daavon kii pole kholane ke liye vednaa raily kaa aayojan kiya tha
 a Takwar lobby of the JDU favors strategically supporting Pappu Yadav from Purnia
 unke mutabik pappu yadav ko party main bhi shaamil karne main hichak nahin honi chahie, kyonki ab ve patna hycourt se bari ho gaye hai
 Says a JDU leader, 'if anyone is able to compete with Uday Singh in Purnia, then he can be Pappu Yadav
 ' bijepi or jediu ke rishton se hi pappu yadav ke prati unka vyavhaar tay hoga
 Though Pappu is close to the Congress, because his wife and former Saharsa MP Ranjita Ranjan is in the Congress, but now the Congress itself is making a strong pitch for Nitish in Bihar, which Pappu Yadav cannot ignore
 2004 main madhepura upachunaav main jab pappu yadav ne apana pichhlaa chunaav ladaa tha, to unhone jediu ke pratyaashee aar

 Both Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar campaigned in support of the JDU candidate in that election, yet Pappu Yadav emerged victorious by a huge margin
 nau saal baad ab donon netaa pappu ko apni yojana ke liye upyogi maan sakate hai
 Without discussing anything, Pappu Yadav told India Today, 'I will focus all my attention on Purnia, Madhepura, Khagaria and Bhagalpur parliamentary constituencies
 'pappu yadav saaf taur se ek saansad ke taur par bani apni garib samarthak chhavi ko hi bhunaane kaa iraadaa rakhte hai

 This law became the biggest disaster for Rajiv Gandhi's tenure

 This terrorist training institute in Balakot was headed by Maulana Yusuf Azhar alias Ustad Gauri, brother-in-law of jaish-e-mohammed Masood Azhar
 pakistan ne hamale kii baat to kabuuli lekin kaha ki aisa koi nuksaan nahin hua
 - Media report also claimed that around 300 terrorists were killed in this operation
 iske jawaab main pakistan ne ghatnasthal kii tasviir jari karte hue poocha ki agar aisa hua to koi saboot hoga
 Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that Indian planes tried to enter Pakistani airspace, but there was no harm in their efforts
 pakistani sena ne kaha ki bhartiya vayusena ne 4 bam jarur giraae, lekin kisi bhi makaan yaa jaan kaa koi nuksaan nahin hua

 jabaki pakistan kah rahaa he ki jis vimaan ko maar giraane kaa daawa bharat kar rahaa he, uskaa istemaal is oparation main kiya hi nahin gaya
 Thus, on Tuesday and Wednesday, both action and reaction were witnessed amidst the tensions that followed the terror attack on the CRPF camp in Pulwama on 14 February

 At the same time, after the photos were released, researcher Michael Deutschman of California's Center for Nonproliferation Studies had said that it is a very large missile
 is tarah kii missile banane kii kshamta kaaphi kam deshon ke paas hi he
 Let us tell you that it is important for the missile to be big because in order to reach America, a lot of fuel has to be filled in the missile
 diutsman ke anusaar is nae inter continental belistic missile ke ingine main bhi badlaav kiya gaya he
 The launcher was also arranged specifically for the Korean-based Hwasong-15 missile
 uttar korea ke anusaar Hwasong-15 missile ke liye khaas domestic elector launture kaa prayog kiya gaya
 With this launcher ready at home, North Korea will no longer have to depend on China

 It weighs less than any nuclear bomb in North Korea
 america ke west coast pahunchane ke liye uttar korea ko missile kaa vajan 500 kilo se kam rakhana hoga
 In such a situation, if North Korea wants to reach the US, then it will have to keep the weight of its nuclear bomb at least less than 350 kg

 " This song used to be played only in the public meetings of the Aam Aadmi Party, but after becoming popular, the party also introduced it as an advertisement on the radio, and then the song went on the tongue of the people of Delhi
 
 
 iske jawaab main bijepi ne bhi naaraa diya or baad main gaanaa bhi aayaa, "chalo, chalem modi ke saath

 Tawaif, who has a common belief in society that she is just a woman who entertains by singing and dancing
 haalanki "tawayph" shabd ke myne duusare bhi hai
 But many people do not know about that
 or tawaayphon ko lekar jo lokapriy dharna bani he, kahin na kahin uske peeche cinema he
 Manjari Chaturvedi says, "you call me by the way, i will not mind
 itihaas ke is pahalu ke bare main bahut kam log jaanate hai
 "chaturvedi admits that she is about 20 years late in narrating the story of tawaifs to the world
 bataa den ki manjari kathak dancer hai or apane sho ke jariye tawaayphon ko lekar bani avadharanaon ko todane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 Their shows share fantastic stories of women

 She has been performing since the age of 16
 yaheen se unka rujhaan "tawayph" hone kii kala kii taraf badha
 Tawaifs, which were once more than being dancers of royal palaces
 ek baatcheet main manjari ne kaha, "hamane mahila parforgers ko utani izzat nahin di he jitani purush parforgers ko
 And if both men and women are performers, then why are men starring and women just dancing? "manjari alleges that the Society looked down on any self-sufficient woman and compared her to a" prostitute "to make her famous
 bollywood ne bigaadi tawaayphon kii chhavimanjari ke mutabik, yahi cheez bollywood main bhi saamne ai jisane tawaayphon ko lekar apane hisaab se ek maansikta bana rakhi thi
 She has always been shown as an helpless woman

 For centuries, however, tawaifs used to be the best means of entertainment and prohibition for the common people

 sanbhal ke thana baniyather main rahane vaali ek naaballig ladki ko teen yuvakon ne mitti kaa tel daalkar jinda jalaane kii koshish kii

 You may be wondering what is the connection of doctors lying down on the flight, then we tell you the whole matter
 8 march ko ek airline ke karmchaaree ne IGI airport par sarkaar ke niyukt kiye hue doctor ko phone karke dubai se ai flite ke yatriyon kii jaanch karne ke liye kaha to doctor ko apni neend kharaab hone par gussa aa gaya
 The doctor tore the no-objection certificate and told the employee that the passenger should wait for an hour to get the NOC or apologize to them
 india gandhi international airport par aise maamle lagaataar badhate ja rahe hai, jab doctor international flite se aane vaale musafiron kii swine flu kii jaanch karne main der karte hai, jisase flite kaa shedul gadabada jaataa he
 As per the data available with our associate newspaper 'mail Today', the Airport Health Organization (APHO) doctors are on average getting a flight late every 10 days
 jabaki rojaanaa in doctoron kii vajah se aadhe ghante kii deree ho jaati he
 Passengers have complained of being delayed for six hours due to doctors
 civil avinshan nideshaalay ne sabhi flites ke udne se pehle unhen scan karne ke aadesh die hue hai, taaki swine flu kaa infections na failein
 But the Ministry of Health believes that it is not possible to scan one lakh passengers daily at the airport
 isi vajah se philhal doctor un chaar deshon se aane vaali 12 airlines ke yatriyon kii jaanch karte hai, jahaan swine flu kaa sabase zyada asar he
 According to an airport official, there have been many such cases when APHO doctors have caused flights to lapse and passengers have to face harassment
 haalanki ye doctor in aaropon se inkaar karte hai
 According to the airport official, 'last year, a flight from Kenya Airways to Uri from IGI Airport was asked to come back because APHO doctors forgot to check a passenger in it
 kenya airways ne bataaya ki flite pakistan pahunch chuki he or ab wo use waapas dilli nahin laa sakate
 ' netaaon main sabase zyada shaleenta chunaav nateezon ke baad hi dikhaai detii he
 It is only natural for the one who wins, and the one who loses has no other option
 chaar rajyon, or khaas taur par dilli main, congress kaa supada saaf hone ke baad shahjade rahul gandhi ne isi shaleenta kaa parichay dete hue aam aadmi party se seekhney kaa elaan kar diya
 Sanjay Jha and Digvijay Singh have not yet built big bridges in praise of this after their historic announcement, which is again a historical thing
 lekin rahul baba kaa aam aadmi party se seekhney kaa bayaan mahaan or shaleen banane kii koshish ke alaava or kuch nahin he
 Black and white time is of color TV, but the era of black money more than white money in politics is still in full swing
 aam aadmi party kaa seenaa thok kar daawa he ki unhone chunaav prachaar main sirf safed paise kaa prayog kiya, or har choti-badi donneton ke liye unhone raseeden kaati hai
 Can Rahul Gandhi and the Congress take a pledge that they will also use only white money in the elections, and put all the donations received by the party on the website? Cleanliness is very important
 Kejriwal sweeps his party before cleaning Delhi i talk about cleaning up, we say without any doubt that if even one day before the election, there will be any evidence of corruption against any candidate, then Midwar will be removed from the field
 unhone rajouri garden main aisa karke bhi dikhaaya
 At the same time, the biggest thing for almost all other parties, including the Congress, is to identify the candidate who takes the seat
 lok sabha or lagbhag har vidhaan sabha main unke daagiyon kii sankhya dekhte hue kya aapako lagata he ki rahul gandhi sirf saaf-suthere ummidavaaron ko hi tikat denge?parivaravadab is mudde par to rahul gandhi kejariwal se shaayad ratti bhar bhi na sikh paaen
 The constitution of the Aam Aadmi Party states that two people of the same family will never get an election ticket
 rahul baba ko to ab tak vot maangane ke liye apni swargeey daadi or divangat pita kii yaad aa rahi he
 So if Rahul Gandhi learns something from the AAP, first of all he will have to leave the party himself
 chodenge kya?basixdonon partiyon main sabase bada antar hi vichaardhaara kaa he
 As of now, if you look at the track record of AAP, then it has 'boring' type of issues like problems of the people, progress of the country, etc
, and perhaps everyone is confident that this party will also live up to its promises
 vahiin 'jijaji' se lekar ghotaalon kii lambi list lekar baithi congress ke bare main kya yah maahaul aaj desh main he?aam admiam aadmi party banate hi congress kaa priyatam naaraa 'congress kaa haath, aam aadmi ke saath' unase chhin gaya
 How many Congress mps or mlas do you remember today, one of whom is a former slum journalist, one is a former NSG commando, one is an insurance agent or a student with a bank balance of just a few thousand! If Rahul Gandhi really wants to learn something from Kejriwal, then see how many 'common men' he gives tickets for in the next elections? It is not necessary that after spending the night in the hut of a poor, you will become his messiah overnight, It is not necessary that you will take the title of the new angry-young Man by rolling up the sleeves in the rally, it is also not necessary that you will become the hero of the people by opposing the cabinet of your own government
 bhai sahab, yadi sirf kuch maheene puraani party aapaki 'majboot or vikaas karne vaali' mukhyamantri ko chaaron khaane chitt kar sakati he, or dilli ke aapke saare vidhayakon ko ek hi SUV main feet karne laayak bana sakati he to aap ko behad gambhir aatm-manthan karne kii jarurat he, jo aap karenge nahin
 know why? Because you are that special leader of the Khas Aadmi Party, who has inherited the throne of power, not by hard work, and a whole army of sycophants is ready around you
 lekin ab saavdhaan! bhale hi saath main chanakya ho na ho, lekin aapke singhaasana ko compane ke liye ek chandragupta ne qamar kas lee he
 In Pakistan, which is facing inflation, not only the prices of common food items have skyrocketed, but the price of milk along with petrol and diesel has become out of the reach of common man

 85 price of CNG in Pakistan

 In Pakistan, petroleum products attract GST of 17 per cent

 com / gnzgzdwaiw Attacking him over the statement of Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Rameshke Mandir comparing Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray temple to toilet, on Monday, he said that the Congress is responsible for the lack of toilets in the country
 thakare ne kaha ki yah hairaan karne vaali baat he ki desh ke kareeb do-tihaai log ab bhi khule main shouch ke liye jate hai
 He said that in the last 65 years of the country's independence, most of the Congress ruled here, but they did nothing to solve this social problem
 jairam ramesh ke bayaan ke baad unka poster jalayashivsena pramukh ne kaha ki mandiron kaa nirmaan log swaichha se apane sansadhano se karaate hai, lekin shauchalayon kaa nirmaan sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 Thackeray wanted to know why Jairam did not talk about mosques and madrasas or churches instead of temples? What was the need to target only temples? Thackeray said sarcastically that if Jairam used to name a mosque or madrasa, Muslim clerics would issue fatwas against him in the same way as they did against Salman Rushdie
