 esaspi vaibhav krishna ne bataaya ki is saal 19 agast ko bulandshahr ke mehsana gaanv main ek kaarykram ke dauraan sushamaa par hamalaa kiya gaya tha
 Ajay Bose's book 'behenji', based on the life of Mayawati, gives detailed information about the incident that occurred in the guesthouse that day
 bataaya jaataa he ki, 1995 ke guestaouse cond main jab kuch kathith taur par sapa ke gundon ne basapa supremeo mayawati ko kamare main band karke maaraa or unke kapade faad die the
 Somehow Mayawati had locked herself in the room and Samajwadi Party mlas and supporters from outside were engaged in breaking the door
 is bich, kaha jaataa he ki apni jaan par khelkar bijepi vidhayak bramhadatt dvivedi maukey par pahunche or sapa vidhayakon or samarthakon ko peeche dhakela
 Please tell that the image of Brahmadutt Dwivedi was also of a domineering leader
 upi kii raajnneeti main is cond ko guestaouse cond kaha jaataa he or ye bharat kii raajnneeti ke maathe par kalank he
 Mayawati herself started calling Brahmadatta Dwivedi a brother and kept saying publicly that he had saved my life regardless of his life
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki bramhadatt dvivedi sangh ke sevak the or unhen lathi chalaani bhi bakhubi aati thi isliye wo ek lathi lekar hathiyaaron se las gundon se bhid gaye the
 This is the reason that Mayawati too always considered him her elder brother and never pitched her candidate against him
 puure rajya main mayawati bijepi kaa virodh karti raheen, lekin farrukhabad main bramhadatt dvivedi ke liye prachaar karti thim
 It is said that when the goons later shot and killed Brahmadutt Dwivedi, Mayawati went to her house and wept bitterly
 unki vidhwaa ne jab chunaav ladaa tab mayawati ne unke khilaaf koi ummidavaar nahin utaara balki logon se apil kii thi ki meri jaan bachaane ke liye dushmani mol lekar shahid hone vaale mere bhai kii vidhwaa ko vot den
 According to some reports, he (samajwadi Party mlas, activists and mob) was using vulgar language and abusive language
 kaaman haul main baithe vidhayakon (bahujan samaaj party ke vidhayak) ne jaldi se mukhya dwaar band kar diya, parantu jhund ne use todakar khol diya
 Then they cracked down on the helpless BSP mlas and started slapping and thrashing them
 bataaya jaataa he ki kam-se-kam paanch basapa vidhayakon ko ghasitate hue jabardasti atithi grih ke baahar le jaakar gadiyon main daalaa gaya tha, jo unhen mukhyamantri ke nivas sthaan par le gaye
 These mlas were asked to sign and sign an oath to join the BSP rebel group led by Raj Bahadur and to support the Mulayam Singh government on a paper
 unamem se kuch to itane dar gaye the ki unhone kore kaagaj par hi dastakhat kar die
 The mlas were kept captive there for much of the night, at which time the BSP mlas were being held in the extreme house in such a way as to take the chickens to the butchers, in front of the set 1-2 of the rooms, Where Mayawati was sitting with some mlas
 ek vicitra naatak ghatit ho rahaa tha, baahar kii bheed se kuch-kuch vidhayak batch kar nikal aae the or unhone unheen kamaron me chhipane ke liye sharan le lee thi
 The last senior BSP leader to come in was RK Chaudhary, who was rescued under the supervision of constable Rashid Ahmed and Chaudhary's personal guard Lalchand
 kamaron main chhipe vidhayakon ko lalchand ne darvaaj andar se lock karne kii hidaayat di or unhone abhi daravaaje band hi kiye the ki bheed main se ek jhund galiyare main dhaddhadata hua ghusaa or darwaja peetane laga
 Mayawati was rescued by two junior police officers Himmat
 ye the vijay bhushan, jo hajratganj stesan ke house afasar (esechao) the or subhash singh baghel jo esechao (viipi) the, jinhone kuch sipaahiyon ko saath le kar badi mushkil se bheed ko peeche dhakela
 Then they all stood in queue in the corridor so that no one could cross them
 krodhit bheed ne phir bhi naare lagaana or gaaliyaan dena chaalu rakhaa or mayawati ko ghaseet kar baahar laane kii dhamkee detii rahi
 Apart from this courageous and timely action of some police officers, most of the officers present, including the handlers and security staff at the state guest house, made no attempt to stop the madness
 yah sab ek ghante se zyada samay tak chalata rahaa
 The statements of several BSP mlas and some police officers were shocking that while senior mlas of Lucknow OP Singh were also present at the time when the mlas were being kidnapped and Mayawati's rooms were under attack
 chashmadidon ke anusaar ve sirf khadey hue cigarette phoonk rahe the
 Immediately after the invasion began, the guest house's electricity and water supplies were cut off - another sign of the administration's collusion
 lakhanu ke jila magistrate ke vahaan pahunchane ke baad hi vahaan ki paristhiti main sudhaar aayaa
 He showed the courage and awareness of combating the angry mob
 espi rajeev ranjan ke saath milakar jila magistrat ne sabase pehle bheed ke un sadasyon ko atithigrih ke daayre ke baahar dhakela, jo vidhayak nahin the
 Later on the arrival of additional force organizations of the police, he got all the SP mlas, including the mlas, out of the purview of the state super-house
 yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unhe vidhayakon par lathicharge karne ke hukum kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Still, he ignored the warning received from the Chief Minister's office not to take action against the SP members of the Assembly, and he stood by his decision
 apni duty bina dare or pakshpaat na karne ke falswaroop raat ko 11 baje ke baad jila magistrate ke liye tatkaal prabhavi rup se tabadale kaa hukum jari kar diya gaya
 As more and more defense teams started reaching the Governor's office, the central government and senior BJP leaders interfered, the situation inside the guest house was controlled
 jab rakshakon ne building ke andar or baahar kabja kar liya tab gaaliyaan, dhamkiyaan or naare lagaati hui bheed dhire-dhire kam hoti chali gai
 Mayawati and her group of party mlas who had locked themselves inside the room set 1-2, had to make repeated requests to the District Magistrate and other officials to make sure that the threat was averted, and they opened the door
 Could jab unhone darwaja kholaa, tab tak kaaphi raat ho chuki thi
 Since then, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh's relationship deteriorated
 uske baad se 24 saal tak donon dalon ke bich naa to chunaav purv or naa hi chunaav ke baad koi gathbandhan hua he
 It remains to be seen whether the hostility caused by the guest house scandal in the SP-BSP changes
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke chauthe charan ke tahat matdaan ho rahaa he

 -input bhashaa se The National Security Guard (NSG) was formed in 1986 on the lines of Germany's GSG-9 as an anti-aircraft hijacking, counter-terrorism and bomb neutralizing force
 aaj ise viviypi ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane ke liye zyada janaa jaataa he
 The Mumbai attack has drawn attention to the capabilities of the NSG and has revealed that this top force is beset with the same problems that have plagued the country's other uniformed decades — outdated equipment and weapons, its purchase from the Ministry of Home Affairs for approval It has been hanging for a long time
 desh kii pramukh aatankwaad nirodhak force 51esaiji or vimaan apharan nirodhak daste 52esaiji main puri tarah sena ke log hai
 Equipment, personnel, training - whatever you name, NSG is backward in all respects
 unke sazosaman kaa zyaadaatar hissaa purana pad gaya he or unhen thik bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 SAG then uses Heckler and PSG 1 sniper rifles
 enesji ke vajood main aane ke baad se in hathiyaaron ko na to badla gaya he or na hi aadhunikeekaran kiya gaya he
 The staircase has not been purchased yet
 pichley dinon mumbai main aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan main hissaa lene vaale ek major poochhate hai, ''kya kharida jaae, iskaa faisla kise karnaa chahie? hamen, jo agrim morche par apni jaan ladaate hai, yaa phir grih mantralay ko, jiske paas na to visheshgyata he or na hi ichha?'' ve kehete hai, ''agar hamaare paas atyaadhunik sazosaman hota to mumbai abhiyaan main hamaare donon logon kii jaan na gai hoti
 "this is a serious allegation but the Ministry of Home Affairs shows indifferent bureaucratic indifference
 purv grih mantri shivaraj patil ke lambey-lambey vaade kabhi puure nahin hue
 On October 23, the nsg's 23rd Foundation Day Parade, Patil had said that "we have to simplify the process of procuring arms and other equipment for various forces so that they can be fully equipped"
 ham apane balon ko aatankwaadiyon se peeche nahin rahane de sakate
 a joint secretary of the ministry gave the reason for this
 ''koi bhi sarkari adhikari jaldbaaji main li se hatakar kharidari kyon karegaa? aisa karne par mana jane lagata he ki us maamle kii dekharekh karne vaale adhikari kaa koi nihit swaarth he
 But former IB chief Arun Bhagat disagrees
 ve kehete hai, ''agar kharidari kii prakriya paardarshee he to shaq kii koi gunjaaish nahin rah jaati
 Apart from these flaws, the fact is that 50 per cent and 20 per cent posts are vacant in SRG and SAG respectively
 aise main sthiti or gambhir najar aane lagati he
 This shortage of soldiers was felt during the Mumbai campaign
 51esaiji ke paas javaanon kii sankhya kam thi or 52esaiji ko madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 This raises the question that if a similar attack had been done at some other place simultaneously, how would it have dealt with it? a NSG lieutenant colonel says, "we don't have an answer
" ''enesji sutron ke mutabik, mumbai pahunchane main 10 ghante kii deree ke peeche kaaran yah tha ki jo vimaan iel-76 51esaiji ke javaanon ko dilli se le jane vaala tha use kuch viviypi ke liye kuch ghante intjaar karnaa padaa
 They were also supposed to leave by the same plane
 is vilamb ke baavjood enesji ne mumbai abhiyaan ke dauraan 48 ghante main 600 se zyada bandhakon ko bachaa liya or prashikshit or hathiyaaron se las aath aatankwaadiyon ko khatm kar diya
 The struggle took place in a highly disruptive urban environment, media broadcast in which two NSG soldiers were martyred
 is sthiti ko bayaan karte hue ek visheshgy kehete hai, ''jawan achche hai; force ko sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 "to avoid such delay, the Ministry of Home Affairs has announced setting up of regional NSG centers in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai or Nagpur
 isse yah ashanka ubhari he ki sarkaar niyukti ke maanakon se samajhaita kiye bagaiyr nae kshetreey kendron ke liye 4,000 atirikt prashikshit javaanon kii vyavastha kaise karegi?paathyakram or drill nirantar badalane ke baavjood prashikshan ab bhi chintaa kaa vishay he
 Insiders believe that training is still limited and the strategy of the operations does not take into account the experiences of other countries with special anti-terrorist squads
 natijatan enesji ke abhiyaan ke bare main pehle hi koi bhi bataa saktaa he
 a lieutenant colonel says, "the terrorists knew about our action in the Mumbai campaign
 ''yah is aalaa force ke asantusht sadasyon kii ore se khatre kii ghanti he, ise nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The NSG is the country's bulwark against terrorism and needs to be sharpened, and the need to make it shine is more than ever today
 kaary yojanamericaya israel kii tarj par 'special oparations kaman' kaa gathan ho jiske paas apana vimaan, helicopter hameshaa taiyaar rahe
 The instant purchase of equipment for NSG should not be included with the normal purchase of other paramilitary forces
 shahrimahaul main aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaan ke liye asli paristhitiyon main niyamit prashikshan or duniya bhar main is tarah ke balon ke saath gahan sampark kii jarurat hoti he
 The number of personnel of this force should not be reduced too much for the establishment of regional centers
 Photo Credit: Instagram / sachintendulkar Former Sri Lankan wicket-keeper batsman Romesh Kaluvitarna has said that India's new Test captain Virat Kohli looks hungry for victory but will also have to deal with the huge burden of expectations
 nipatna hoga apekshaaon sekaluwitarna ne kaha, ‘bharat main apekshaayen bahut adhik hongi
 Many people in his country are very interested in this and would like to see how Kohli molds himself as a captain
 unhen in sab apekshaaon se bhi nibatna hoga
 i am confident that the new captain wants to perform well and he is hungry for victory
 ’srilanka ke liye emportent he sirijasrilanka e ke coach or teen divasiy abhyaas match ke dauraan board president ilevan ke bhi coach rahe kaaluwitarna ne kaha ki teen test maichon kii aagaamee siries srilanka ke liye bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 He said, 'this series is very important for Sri Lanka
 hamane pakistan ke khilaaf pichhali siries main acha pradarshan nahin kiya or hamen vaapasi ke liye khud rasta talashna hoga kyonki bhavishya main ham aage kaise badhenge yah uske liye mukhya kaarak hoga
 Also Sri Lanka would like to leave no stone unturned to win the series for Sangakkara
 ’ isse pehle bharat ne 12 agast se shuru hone vaali siries se pehle ekmaatr abhyaas match drow karaayaa tha jiske bare main kaaluwitarna ne kaha ki yah rigelt siries main khaas myne nahin rakhega
 Team India batted poorly, India scored 351 and 180 runs in two innings in the practice match, although the Indian bowlers did well in this match and bundled the board president XI for 121 runs in the first innings
 bharat kii taraf ajinkya rahane ne pehali pari main shatak jadaa tha
 Indian bowlers, especially Ishant Sharma and r Ashwin, performed well but Rohit Sharma, Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha could not walk among the batsmen
 sangyojan ke bare main bolnaa mushkilhalanki ballebaajon ke kharaab pradarshan ke baavjood bharat pehle test main paanch gendbaajon ke saath utarane ke bare main soch rahaa he
 Regarding this, Kaluvitarna said, 'indian team has been doing this for some time and if they adopt the same strategy here too, it will not be surprising
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘unke sabhi gendbaajon ne yahaan acha pradarshan kiya lekin yah kahana ki unka sangyojan kya hoga, mushkil he
 Until we see Galle's pitch, it is difficult to predict whether he will land with three fast bowlers and two spinners
 amuman ve teen tej gendbaajon or do spinneron ke saath utarate hai
 Some of his bowlers also bat well and in such a situation, any team would like to go with five bowlers in Test cricket

 BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra said in the Parliament House complex here, 'the decision to introduce the bill in the next session will be a shock to the farmers across the country

" uttar pradesh sarkaar pehle hi is sambandh main ek vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kar chuki he or kendra uski nakal kar saktaa he
 Mishra said that his party expressed support for this bill but 'UPA is not bringing the bill in this session
 iske vipareet unhone 31 agast tak is par suzav maangen hai or ise website par daal diya he jiskaa matlab yah he ki vidheyak is satr main nahin aayega
 Taking a dig at Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi on the issue, Mishra said that simply going among the farmers and instigating them or talking about their welfare will do nothing
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi sarkaar kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye gambhir he to use isi satr main vidheyak laana hoga
 Asked whether the issue of land acquisition in Noida and Greater Noida would be resolved by the August 17 deadline set by the Allahabad High Court, Mishra said that the administration and the farmers were talking to each other and hoped Is that they will reach an agreement soon

 In this case 8 pilots have been suspended and 57 have been served notice
 da diarectorat general of civil aviation (dijisie) ne kaha he ki payalton kii yah gadabadi saal main niyamit antaraal par hone vaale pipisi jaanch ke dauraan pataa chali
 Of the 320 pilots, 255 pilots were flying aircraft with expired licenses for less than a month
 57 payalton kaa license 30 se lekar 60 din pehle expire ho chukaa tha
 The license of the same 6 pilots had expired 60 to 90 days earlier, it is amazing that there were two pilots whose license has expired more than 90 days
 jet airways ke sabase zyada 130 payalton kellicense expireho chuke the
 Air India (101) at number two is Air India Charters Limited (70) at number three, followed by Spice Jet (10) and then number Indigo (9)
 jin logon kaa license expire hue 60 din se zyada ho gaya he unhen nilambit kar diya gaya he vahiin jinke license ko expire hue 1 maheene se zyada ho gaya he unhen chetavanee di gai he
 a letter has been sent to all airline heads in this regard

 a Spice Jet spokesperson denied receiving any notice
 On the other hand Air India denied the entire case, saying none of our pilots were flying the aircraft with expired licenses

 Mother milk banks have been opened in various states of the country, which store mother's milk for children
 iske baad jaruratmand bacchon tak yah doodh pahunchaaya jaataa he
 How to keep milk safe? Firstly, the health of women who donate milk in Mother Milk Bank is thoroughly investigated
 is jaanch main yah pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki kahin sambandhit mahila ko koi beemaari to nahin he
 After this, the milk is kept at minus 20 degrees, so that this milk does not spoil for about six months
 koun se rajya hai aage?saal 2018 main jari aankadon ke mutabik rajasthan main sabase zyada (13) madar milk bank banaae gaye hai
 Apart from this, there are (12) in Maharashtra, (10) in Tamil Nadu, mother milk banks

 shishu ke liye kyon jaruri maa kaa doodh?maa kaa doodh ek sampurna aahaar he jisamen bachche kii jarurat ke sabhi poshak tatv uchit maatra main paae jate hai
 The baby digests them easily
 maa ke doodh main maujuud protein or fat gaay ke doodh kii tulana main bhi adhik aasaani se pach jate hai
 This does not cause gas, constipation, diarrhea etc
 in the stomach of the infant and the chances of the child reversing milk is also very less

 Research found that men whose height is 5

 In 2008, Rahul Roshan, a journalist-turned-management student, started a funny news website 'faking News', which funnyly presents all the events happening in the world
 is behad lokapriy vyangy website main sahaj haas-parihaas ke alaava or kuch nahin hota
 In less than a decade, contrary to what Roshan had thought, social media and traditional media have been flooded with information that is often disguised as news and deliberately spread with dubious intent
 soshal media plateform jaise fasebuk, twitor or whatsap jaisi tatkaal sandesh bhejne vaali sevaaon ne ghatnaon ko abhootpurv pahunch or teji pradaan kii he
 The video of a small Bangladeshi leader being murdered by a few people is forwarded by stating how some Muslims in West Bengal are killing a Hindu priest
 yaa myanmar main rohingya musalamaanon ke saath hone vaale atyaachaar ke footage ko yah bataakar prasaarit kiya jaataa he ki assam ke kokarajhaar main yah musalamaanon ke khilaaf ho rahi hinsa kaa video he
 The purpose of such 'misinformation' is to promote anger and violence
 kai baar kisi lokapriy kahani ko sahaara dene ke liye bhi aisa kiya jaataa he
 The example of having a GPS chip in 2,000 notes to detect black money is its example
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki kisi galat khabar ko failaane ke peeche koi tayshuda iraadaa nahin hota, masalan ek rashtriya news channel ne haal hi istambul kii olavrishti ko pune kii ghatana ke rup main dikhaaya
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 'fake news' has spread rapidly, in view of which a group of people living in different parts of the country started a small but relentless fight against this threat
 sach ko jinda rakhane or jhooth kaa bhandaphod karne ke liye tekies, soshal activist, udhyamiyon yaa patrakaron kii yah jamaat ekajute he
 They research very patiently to know the truth behind every video or photograph or any information and put it on their website or whatsapp group for public use
 haalanki is ladaai kii jameen samtal nahin he—unki sankhya darjan bhar bhi nahin, jabaki galat soochnaaon kii baadh-si aa rahi he
 Nevertheless, these fighters have started the adventure of exposing the truth

 Seats continue to pull in the Grand Alliance
 is bich congress kii paramparaagat seat aurangabad jeethanram maanjhi ke cote main chale jane kaa kaaphi virodh dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Nikhil Kumar's candidature was being considered from here, but suddenly this seat was given to the Ham Party
 ham party ne jediu ke emelsi upendra prasad ko yahaan se utraane kaa faisla kiya he
 There is strong opposition in Congress
 aurangabad se aae saidakon kaaryakarta congress ke pradesh karyaalay main dharna pradarshan kar rahe the
 He did not believe that Nikhil Kumar's ticket could also be cut
 mahagathbandhan ke is faisle kaa asar rajput votaron par pad saktaa he
 Aurangabad District Congress Committee President Arvind Kumar Singh said that if he does not listen to them, he can resign collectively
 nikhil kumaar aurangabad se 2004 se chunaav lard rahe hai
 He won from here in 2004, but lost the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 and 2014
 1963 batch ke iapies adhikari nikhil kumaar kaa pariwarik prishthbhumi rajnatik rahi he
 His father Chhote Saheb has represented Aurangabad in the Lok Sabha 7 times along with the Chief Minister of Bihar
 unke dada anugrah narayan singh bhi mahaan swatantraaa senaanee or bihar kii raajnneeti main kaaphi dabadabaa rakhte the, wo bihar ke pehle upmukhyamantri bane the
 Aurangabad Lok Sabha constituency is Rajput Bahul, hence it is also known as Chittorgarh of Bihar
 ek-do maamle chhod den to yahaan se lagaataar rajput ummidavaar kii hi jeet hoti rahi he
 Current BJP MP Sushil Kumar Singh also comes from the Rajput caste
 lekin mahagathbandhan kii taraf se is seat ko ham party ke dene or uske ummidavaar upendra prasad ke yahaan se utarane kii charchaa ne magadh kshetra ke rajputon ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 They feel that a seat which has been almost always won by Rajputs is being tried to make it a non-rajput seat
 nikhil kumaar ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki mahagathbandhan ke is faisle kaa us ilaake ko aadha darjan siton par asar pad saktaa he
 Nikhil Kumar's image has been clean
 wo dilli ke police kamishnar ke saath-saath indo tibet or enesji ke diji bhi rah chuke hai
 He stepped into politics for the first time in 2004 after his retirement in 2001 and won
 haalanki uske baad ke do chunaavon main unki haar jarur hui
 Nikhil Kumar has also served as the Governor of Nagaland and Kerala
 nikhil kumaar ke pita satyendra narayan sinha aurangabad seat se 7 baar saansad rahe
 Five times he won on Congress ticket and 2 times on Janata Party ticket
 immergency kaa virodh karte hue unhone congress chhod di thi or 1977 or 1980 kaa chunaav janata party ke tikat par jite
 Then in 1984 he joined the Congress
 nikhil kumaar ke samarthakon ne party par tikat bechney kaa aarope lagaaya he
 They allege that Bihar in-charge Shakti Singh Gohil, state president Madan Mohan Jha and campaign campaign president Akhilesh Singh have conspired and cut Nikhil Kumar's ticket
 iskaa asar sasaram par bhi padegaa, jahaan se purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ummidavaar ho sakati hai
 But Congress sources said that another Congress candidate from Aurangabad was engaged in loud lobbying, Awadhesh Singh, a former minister in the Bihar government
 party kaa kahana he donon main takaraav na ho isliye aisa faisla liya gaya
 Security forces were asked to remain vigilant on Sunday after the separatists announced a boycott of Republic Day

 Hitting out at Rahul inside the Lok Sabha, Irani said, "it is for the first time in the history of the country that someone from the Gandhi family has been accused of insulting women and calling them rape
" unhone kaha, "hindustan ke itihaas main pehali baar he ki koi netaa jor-shor se kah rahaa he ki bhartiya mahilaon ke saath dushkarm kiya janaa chahie
 Does he mean that every man in India wants to rape women? Is this Rahul Gandhi's message to the people of the country? ”the minister along with other mps in the lower house demanded an apology from Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha, "rahul gandhi ko raajnneetik majaak udaane or 'bharat main mahilaon kaa dushkarm karne ke aahvaan' ke liye dandit kiya janaa chahie
 "irani said that women are nobody's personal property and they (rahul) should know that if someone incites women to rape, women know how to give them proper answers
 diemke saansad kanimojhi ne kaha ki yah bayaan 'sansad ke baahar' diya gaya tha
 Reversing this, the minister said that raising voice against crime against women is at least one of the things that an MP can do

 Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad has made a big disclosure saying that he had to step down as the coach of the national team in 1999, as some players were openly indulging in corruption and adopting unethical methods
 miyandad ne kaha, 'maine cricket board ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh khalid mahmud se kaha tha ki yaa to karrwai karen yaa pakistan cricket aane vaale samay main iskaa khamiyaja bhugtegaa
 My conscience did not allow me to continue as a coach and i left the post in 1999
 ' Miandad, who played 124 Tests and 233 odis for Pakistan, was also the Director General of Cricket in PCB
 unhone kaha, '1999 main match phixing ke khatre se pakistan cricket kii jaden kamjor ho gai
 Comments miyandad ko england main vishwa cap se kuch hafte pehle coach ke pad se istipha dena padaa, jab kuch khilaadiyon ne unke khilaaf baghawat kar di thi
 The players had refused to play under his coaching and even stated this clearly at the ceremony held before the World Cup in Islamabad
 unka kahana tha ki miyandad ne sharajah main hue ek toornament main un par match phixing ke bebuniyaad iljaamat lagaae the
 Mahmood said last week that Miandad had to step down as coach, as he wanted more authority in selection issues
 vahiin miyandad ne 'jang' akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha, 'unhone jo kaha, vah sach nahin he
 i warned him that some players are playing intentionally poorly
 maine kaha tha ki yaa to ve karrwai karen yaa pakistan cricket aane vaale samay main iskaa khamiyaja bhugtegaa
 He did not trust me at that time and today we are seeing the result
 ' unhone kaha, 'kuch saal baad said anwar ne mujhase maafee maangi ki vah mere khilaaf muhim kaa hissaa tha
 He admitted that some players used to provoke junior players against me
 ' Miandad said, 'I told Khalid Mehmood, the then chairman of the cricket board, to either take action or Pakistan cricket will pay the brunt of it in the coming times
 meri antaratma ne mujhe coach pad par bane rahane kii ijaajat nahin di or maine 1999 main pad chhod diya
 ' pakistan ke liye 124 test or 233 vanade khel chuke miyandad pisibi ke cricket mahanideshak bhi rahe
 He said, 'pakistan cricket's roots have weakened in 1999 due to the threat of match fixing
 'tippaniyan Miandad had to resign as coach in England a few weeks before the World Cup, when some players rebelled against him
 khilaadiyon ne unki koching main khilne se inkaar kar diya tha or islamabad main vishwa cap se pehle yojit samaaroh main yah saaf taur par kah bhi diya tha
 He said that Miandad had unjustly accused him of match-fixing in a tournament in Sharjah
 mahmud ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki miyandad ko coach ke pad se hataanaa padaa, kyonki vah chayan masalon main adhik adhikaar chaahate the
 Miandad said in an interview to 'jang' newspaper, 'what he said is not true
 maine unhen chetaya tha ki kuch khilaadi jaan boojhkar kharaab khel rahe hai
 i said that either they take action or Pakistan cricket will bear the brunt of it in the coming times
 unhone us samay mujh par bharosa nahin kiya or aaj ham uskaa nateeja dekh rahe hai
 He said, 'A few years later Saeed Anwar apologized to me that he was part of the campaign against me

 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was on the target of terrorists killed in a police encounter on 15 June 2004
 is baat kaa khulaasa intelligence beuro yani ibi ke khat se hota he
 In this letter, the IB himself admitted that he had informed the Gujarat police about this, after the Godhra riots, including Narendra Modi, Lal Krishna Advani and Praveen Togadia are on the target of Pakistan terrorists
 aaj tak kii exclusive report se puure maamle se ab pardaa hat gaya he
 The dreaded conspiracy of terror is exposed to the letter by the IB chief, which he has written to the CBI Director on February 28, 2013
 is khat main saaf-saaf likhaa he
 
 
 Since the Godhra riots, the IB has been receiving information that the lives of many Hinduist and religious leaders, including Narendra Modi, are in danger
 ek khaas jaankaree ke mutabik lashkar-e-taiyaba bharat main sakriy apane logon se laal krishna adwani, narendra modi or viechpi netaa praveen togadiya kii awajahi ke bare main jaankariyaan ikattha karne ke liye kah rahaa he
 The IB sent this information to police chiefs of all states on 22 April 2004
 is jaankaree par kaam karte hue ibi ne apni sabhi ikaayiyon ko aatankiyon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhane ko bhi kaha
 Rajendra Kumar, Joint Director of IB of Ahmedabad, along with the then Police Commissioner KR Kaushik, also informed that two terrorists of Punjab province of Pakistan are active in Gujarat for different purpose
 in donon aatankwaadiyon ko maharashtra ke pune ilaake kaa rahane vaala ek hidustani yahaan madad kar rahaa he
 Meaning, it is clear from the IB letter that the Intelligence Department had informed the Gujarat Police about two Pakistanis roaming in Gujarat with the intention of killing Narendra Modi
 ibi ke isi khat main aage kaha gaya he ki ishrat jahaan samet maare gaye chaaron aatankwaadiyon ke bare main ibi ko media ke hawaale se jaankaree mili
 In the same letter, it is said that the alias used by two of the four terrorists was similar to that used by the Joint Director of Ahmedabad and informed the Commissioner of Police
 epabiai ne jis david hedli ko giraftaar kiya, usne bhi apane bayaan main kaha he ki lashkar ke commander mujammil ne use bataaya tha ki ishrat jahaan lashkar-e-taiyaba kii fidaayin aatanki he, jise khud mujammil ne hi lashkar main shaamil kiya tha
 Not only this, Pakistani terrorist Shaheed Mahmood Basra, who was arrested in Kashmir, had told that one of the terrorists killed in Ahmedabad is Pakistani fidayeen
 mujammil ne viipi logon ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye bheja tha
 Whether the four militants, including Ishrat Jahan were killed in a fake encounter or not, will be decided by the court, but one thing is clear that Ishrat was a terrorist and had a relationship with the commander of laskar-e-taiba as well as the two Pakistanis who Laskar was sent with the intention of killing leaders and vips in Hindustan
 koun-koun the aatankiyon ke nishane par
 
 
 Target number 1- Bal Thackerattarget number 2- Lal Krishna Advanirate number 3- Ashok Singhaltarget number 4- Praveen Togadia, when the terrorists had hatched this conspiracy, the remaining four people were out of Gujarat, so the terrorists had hatched the entire conspiracy for Narendra Modi 
 jaaniye kya he puraa vakya
 
 
 On 15 June 2004, the Gujarat Police killed four terrorists in the city of Ahmedabad in the early hours
 media ke log jab vahaan pahuche, to pataa chalaa ki maare gaye aatankwaadiyon main mumbai ke mumbra ilaake main rahane vaali ek ladki ishrat jahaan bhi thi
 This was the first case when a woman along with Pakistani terrorists had been shot dead by the police
 baaki maare gaye aatankwaadiyon main do lashkar ke aatanki amjad ali rana or jishaan johar the, jabaki ki teesraa aatanki javed shaikh tha jo ki kerala kaa rahane vaala tha
 Javed was responsible for helping these Pakistani terrorists at the local level and according to the police, he had also married Ishrat
 haalanki ishrat kii maut ko lekar usee samay siyasat shuru ho gai
 People also demonstrated in Mumbai, but no government system except Ishrat and Javed's family believed that the encounter was fake
 haalanki tab kendra main congress ke netritv vaali upie kii sarkaar thi or gujarat main bijepi kii sarkaar thi
 The encounter was carried out by 20 policemen, including DIG Vanzara, DIG, Gujarat Police
 kareeb paanch saal tak ye maamle shant rahaa
 Metropolitan Magistrate SC Tawang, who is investigating the case, filed a 243-page report with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on 7 September 2009 after five years stating that it was a case of death in Hirassam
 tawang kii report main ye bhi kaha gaya ki gujarat police ne 12 june ko ishrat auki uske teen auki saathiyon ko mumbai se uthaaya or 14 june ko hiraasat main unki hatya kar di gai
 The report also said that Ishrat Jahan neither had a relationship with any terrorist group nor did Narendra Modi risk a life from these people
 report main adishnal diji peepi pandey, diaiji diji vanjaaraa auki tatkaaleen ahmedabad ke police kamishnar kowshik samet tamaam pulisavaalon ke naam bhi daal diya gaya
 The trial was ordered considering it a fake encounter
 9 sitambar 2009 ko gujarat hoicourt ne is report par ste laga diya or kaha ki gujarat ke varisht police adhikariyon kii esaiti maamle kii jaanch kare
 The SIT, in its report, questioned Magistrate Tawang's report and dismissed it
 isi bich ishrat jahaan kii maa shamima bano kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue hycourt ne ek or esaiti ke gathan ke aadesh die, jisamen gujarat ke baahar kaa ek varisht police adhikari ke alaava yachikakarta ke pasandida adhikari ko shaamil karne ke aadesh die
 The funny thing is that about three senior police officers involved in this SIT left the investigation in the middle because the case was quite complicated and there were differences between the ways of working of an SIT member IG Satish Verma
 bamushkil esaiti ne 21 november, 2011 ko apni report hoicourt main pesh kii, jisamen kaha gaya ki ishrat auki uske saathiyon ko farji muthbhed main maaraa gaya
 The SIT report, however, did not mention whether the victims were terrorists or not
 chunki maamla kai rajyon se judaa tha, isliye hoicourt ne maamle kii jaanch janvari, 2012 main sibiai ke hawaale kar di
 But even after so many days in this case, the CBI has not yet filed the charge sheet

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the chief negotiator of the Narendra Modi government and the chief electoral strategist of the BJP, is explaining how the 2019 election is different from the 2014 election
 shweta punjko die ek saakshaatkaar main unhone kaha ki agar 2014 kaa chunaav ummiido par kendrit tha to 2019 ke centre main rashtriya suraksha he
 Excerpts from the conversation: After five years of the Modi government, all the surveys now show that the rural crisis and employment issues are among the main concerns
 kya sarkaar main shaamil logon ko bhi bhaan he ki is chunaav ke pramukh mudde ye hai?hamane gramin kshetron main pehle se kahin zyada nivesh kiya he
 Who are getting houses, gas connections and toilets? They are farmers and rural workers only
 hamane krishi upajon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya badhaane kaa prayaas kiya he par bahut sari chizon ke maamle main ab bhi antar he
 a strong public procurement system is yet to be developed, but state governments will have to be made responsible for this
 aisa kyon he ki gramin aadharbhoot dhaanche ke nirmaan or die gaye mudra rinon ko rojgaar ke aankadon main shaamil kiya ja rahaa he?main or aap chaar bhaaiyon ke bich 10 hectare kheti kii jameen vaale kisi parivaar main jaaen or aap sawaal puuchhen ki ''kya tumhaare paas naukari he?'' jawaab milegaa 'nahin
 "may i ask," Do you have the means to live? "then the answer will be," Yes
 'rojgaar-viheen pragati' ke liye sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he
 We have faced a lot of fake campaigns; You cannot be the best in the world, while also facing the crisis while being involved in the fastest growing economies
 bhaajapa kaa chunavi nerrative vikaas kii bajaay pahchaan kii raajnneeti par kendrit he
 Absolutely wrong
 ab tak koi chunaav aisa rahaa he jo hindu-muslim muddon se dur rahaa ho to vah yahi chunaav he
 The paramount concern of the people is national security and not identity politics
 2014 se kitna alag he 2019?2014 kaa chunaav ummid kaa chunaav tha
 Modi promised a better future
 logon ne unhen apana mat diya
 The 2019 election is meant to strengthen the elections
 aap is nerrative kaa muqabla kaise karenge ki modi sarkaar aapako 6,000 ru
 Will give annually and Congress government Rs 6,000
 maheenaa degi?modi sarkaar ne isse aage kii hajaaron chijen di hai
 Due to the poor history of the Congress party, people have no faith in 'justice'
 unke liye garibi chunavi hatkandaa he
 Congress has said that it will bring uniform rate GST
 yah suzav aise vyakti kaa he jise na jiesti kii samaj he na bharat kii aarthik sthitiyon kii
 The idea of imposing the same GST on rice and Mercedes is silly

 The makers who made the film Main Hoon Padmavati have made it clear that while making the movie, we will take care that nobody's feelings get hurt
 apni film ke liye bhi ham bhansaali kii padmavati jaise virodh kii ummid nahin karte hai
 Bhansali, who was trying to make Padmavati for 18 years, tell us that Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted to make this film from about 18 years ago
 iske liye us vakt unhone star cast bhi final kar lee thi, haalanki tab aisa nahin ho paaya
 For some reason, the film went into cold storage
 darasal, 1999 main salmaan khan, ajay devgan or aishwarya raay ke saath 'ham dil de chuke sanam' banane ke baad se hi bhansaali ke dimag main bajirao-mastaani or 'padmavati' kii kahani thi

 Drabu was also known as a key figure negotiating with the Center on behalf of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party
 pratyaksh taur par unhen hataae jane kii vajah unka vah vivaadaaspad bayaan bataaya ja rahaa tha jo unhone nai dilli main kuch rajanyikon ke saamne diya tha, jisamen unhone kashmir samasya ke 'raajnneetik' pahaluon se zyada uske 'saamaajik' pahaluon par jor die jane kii maang kii thi
 But the real reason for this is something the party would not like to reveal
 kuch jaankaron kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti said ke is kadam kaa makasad ghati main party kii teji se girti saakh ko bachaane or gathbandhan kii saajheedaar bhaajapa ko kadaa sandesh dene kii koshish he
 Except for the appointment of former Intelligence Bureau chief Dineshwar Sharma as a mediator in October last year, the PDP-BJP alliance has hardly done any work towards fulfilling the promises made in the Agenda of Alliance (AOA)
 is agenda kaa masauda 2014 main drabu or bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ne sanyukt rup se taiyaar kiya tha
 Nothing has been done on the "dialogue with all the internal and external parties" from the key points of the coalition - from the necessary reforms in governance to the duress of NHPC and the withdrawal of the Uri power project to the state
 mukhyamantri mahabuuba pradhanmantri narendra modi se kai baar pakistan or hurriyat ke saath dobaaraa baatcheet karne kii apil kar chuki hai
 These requests of the Chief Minister have not been taken into account at all and have been consistently ignored
 november 2015 main modi ne divangat netaa mufti mohammad said ko jo sandesh diya tha, thik usee rukh kaa anusaran karte hue madhav ne is saal farvari main kaha tha ki pakistan ke saath baatcheet kaa samay kya hoga, yah centre kaa visheshadhikaar he
 He said, "mehboobis may have their own opinion, because they feel that if two governments interact with each other, then violence can reduce
 lekin (is vishay par) gathbandhan main koi raay nahin bana saktaa, iske adhikaar rajya ke maamalon main simit hai
 PDP general workers have been questioning the decision to tie up with the BJP for a long time
 mufti parivaar ke kareebi or pidipi ke ek varisht mantri kaa kahana he, ''is gathbandhan ke kaaran party kii saakh khatm ho chuki he
 Most of the PDP leaders admit that the coalition has alienated voters, especially in the party stronghold of South Kashmir
 niraash hone vaale in matadaataaon main badi sankhya main ve yuva hai jinhone 2014 ke vidhansabha ke chunaav prachaar main 'algaavvaadiyon ke prati naram rukh or bhaajapa ke khilaaf sakchat rukh' ke kaaran party ko vot diya tha
 "by sacking Drabu, Mehbooba has shown the way out to the person who drafted the terms of the alliance between PDP and BJP," says a senior PDP leader
 haalanki gathbandhan abhi barkaraar he lekin mahabuuba—bhaajapa or apane matadaataaon donon ko—sanket de rahi hai ki jarurat hui to ve gathbandhan se alag bhi ho sakati hai
 "the new finance minister Syed Altaf Bukhari, who has been replaced by Drabu on behalf of Mehbooba, said in Srinagar," There will be no compromise on the ideology of our party and if the situation worsens, we will not hesitate to break the alliance
 
 ''bhaajapa se alag hone kaa sanket dene kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier this month, Mehbooba in her cabinet turned down the demand of BJP ministers to hand over an investigation into the rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Kathua (jammu) in the month of January to the CBI
 was
 is maamle ne ek bada raajnneetik rang pakadaa tha kyonki ise dakshinpanthi hinduon kii naaraazgi ke nattejey ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he jo jammu kshetra main muslim pravaasiyon ke aa jane se gusse main hai
 Some ministers of the BJP have demanded a procession on the streets to hand over the matter to CBI
 lekin mukhyamantri is par adi hui hai ki rajya police hi maamle kii puri jaanch karegi
 Analysts believe that it is only a matter of time
 mahabuuba kabhi bhi bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan tod sakati hai
 Given the failure of the AOA to enforce the conditions and the escalating violence in the valley, this is the only way the PDP can hope to manage its position in the state to some extent

 dilli main aam aadmi party(aap) kii ore se shiksha kshetra main uthaae gaye kadamon kii charchaa hoti he
 On many occasions, AAP leaders claim to improve the condition of government schools through photographs
 aam aadmi party sarkaar na keval nae skulon ko kholane ke saath puraane skulon kii surat sanvaarane kii disha main khud ko lagaataar sakriy bataati he, balki yah bhi daawa kiya jaataa he ki ab privet skulon ke bachche bhi sarkari main daakhila lene lage hai
 In such a situation, BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay has raised questions on the claim that if this is the case then why do the children of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia study in private schools
 agar sachmuch dasha sudhar gai to phir dilli sarkaar ke mantri or vidhayak apane bacchon kaa daakhila kyon nahin karaate
 Sir dilli sarkaar ke adheen maatr 5 aise sarkari skulon kaa naam bataaiye jahaan aapa ke vidhayakon or mantriyon ke bachche padhate hai Or name only 5 mlas of @aamaadmiparty whose children study in Delhi's government school

 duusari partiyaan 15- 15 saal raaj karne ke baad bhi anya rajyon main ye nahin kar pain jo aam aadmi sarkaar ne maatr teen saal main kar diya
 So, it is possible - if the intention is right
 mananeey @arvindkejriwal ji@aamaadmiparty ke kitne vidhayakon-mantriyon ke bachche sarkari skool main padhate hai or mohalla clinics main ilaj karaate hai? How many times have you or your family treated Ahalla Clinic? yadi uttar nahin de sakate hai to eemaandaaree-saadagi kaa paakhand band kariye https: / / t

 @arvindkejriwal, if the condition of Delhi's schools has improved, then why do @msisodia ji's children study in private schools? Why don't you make it mandatory for Delhi legislators and government employees to make a law to teach in a government school and treat them in a government hospital? congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko apni sahyogi partiyon ke netaaon ke daaman par lage daag itane bure lagate hai ki unke saath manch share karne se bhi parhez karte hai

 The Taliban are on the rise at the moment, warning that if the Taliban took control of important parts of the country, it would give al Qaeda a chance to consolidate itself, recruit large-scale terrorists and raise funds
 raksha mantri ne kaha ‘‘sachai yah he ki aisa lagata he ki afghanistan main paryaapt sainik rakhane main hamaari or hamaare sahyogiyon kii aakshamata kii vajah se taliban is vakt ubhaar par he
 Meanwhile, America's leading daily newspaper warned that the Taliban's victory would be a catastrophe for America and its allies
 akhbaar ne jor dekar kaha he ki obama prashasan ko afgaan-pakistan kshetra se taliban ke samul naash par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaiye, chaahe iske liye kitna bhi dhary kyon na rakhana pade

 unke mutabik muslim yuvak ibrahim ne bahala-phusalaakar unki ladki se shaadi kii thi
 In fact, 22-year-old Hindu girl Anjali and 26-year-old Ibrahim from Dhamtari district got married in February this year at an Arya Samaj temple in Raipur

 Anjali appeared in the Supreme Court on Monday and said that Ibrahim had seduced and married her
 anjali ne adaalat ko yah bhi bataaya ki uske mata-pita or parijanon ne uski aazaadee par koi roak nahin lagaai he or na hi use jor jabardastee kar apane kabje main liya he
 After Anjali's statement, the Supreme Court dismissed Ibrahim's petition

 At the same time, according to Ibrahim's lawyer Sajid Khan, the whole matter is of mutual love
 donon ek-duusare se pyaar karte the or balig bhi the
 So they thoughtfully married

 According to Ibrahim, Anjali's family was not ready for her marriage to a non-hindu boy
 isliye usne apane muslim dharm kaa tyaag kar hindu dharm apanaaya tha
 Ibrahim was renamed Aryan Arya after completing the legal formalities of changing religion and renaming the new one
 is nae naam ke saath aryan arya or anjali ne raipur ke arya samaaj mandir main shaadi kii
 After this, both were leading normal lives

 ibrahim ne apni patni ke intjaar main kai din kaate, lekin jab wo waapas nahin lauti to usne bilaspur hai court main bandi pratyakshikaran yachika daayar kii
 The High Court gave its decision on this
 jiske mutabik, anjali ko ek sarkari hostel main 15 dinon tak rukkar rahane or is avadhi main yah faisla lene kaa nirdesh diya tha ki wo aakhir pati yaa apane parijanon main se kiske saath rahanaa chaahati he
 Aryan Arya challenged the July 30 decision of the Bilaspur High Court in the Supreme Court, saying that the court has prevented wife Anjali from living with her husband
 is yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ne is maamle main haadia cese main hue faisle kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 At present, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Anjali after her statements

 The Rajasthan government took Rs 545 crore from the World Bank to help the farmers, but the money could not reach the farmers
 rajasthan sarkaar ne varsh 2008 main kisaanon ko karj dene kii 832 karod kii yojana banaai thi
 Under this scheme, the government tied up with the World Bank for loans
 deree kii vajah kaayade-kanoonvishwa bank ne 832 karod main se 545 karod rupee jari bhi kiye, lekin 2016 tak isamen se sarkaar mahaj 42 karod rupee hikisaanon ko karj baantpai he, jabaki iske byaaj ke badale 48 karod rupee janata kii kamai se sarkaar world bank ko bharegi
 The Rajasthan government says that the delay was due to various rules and regulations
 byaaj main jaaegi janata kii kamaighoshnaaen karnaa or bhul janaa sarkaron kii aadat si ban gai he, lekin sarkaar kii ye aadat jab janata par baari pade to kya kahenge
 The Rajasthan government will give 48 crore rupees of the public's hard-earned money as interest to the World Bank because it forgot to spend Rs 542 crore for the farmers
 kisaanon ko maatr 42 karod kaa vitarandarasal 2008 main vasundhara sarkaar ne rajasthan agriculture compatitiveness project banaaya or funding ke liye centre sarkaar ke jariye world bank ko bheja
 In it, there were plans to distribute loans to farmers by combining various departments like agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, irrigation and ground water
 is bich vasundhara sarkaar chali gai or congress kii gahalot sarkaar ai
 In 2012, it gave a project worth 832 crore to the World Bank for funding the scheme
 jisamen se 545 karod rupye 1
 Were given to the Rajasthan government at an interest rate of 25 per cent
 magar 2016 tak isamen se mahaj 42 karod hi sarkaar kisaanon ko baant pai
 Such loans were to be provided to farmers, 14 lakh 39 thousand rupees for instruments, seeds and fertilizers in 17 districts, 3 lakh 13 thousand rupees for vegetable and solar pumps, 7 lakh two thousand rupees for animal collection, 2 lakh 19 thousand rupees for animal husbandry, irrigation construction 2 lakh 36 thousand rupees for 11 lakh 50 thousand rupees for ground water activities Prabhulal Saini of Rajasthan Government says that the delay was because 1
 chaar vibhaagon ko milakar karj baantne the
 2
 centre sarkaar ne rajasthan transparency act ke bajaae kharch ke liye alag se niyam banane ko kaha
 3
 is yojana main 25 fisadi rakam kisaanon ko pehle kharch kerani thi, jo kisaan karte nahin hai
 4
 sarkaar badalane se yojana par amal nahin ho paaya
 In Rajasthan, it is difficult to get loan but not loan waiver, even though the Yogi government has given loan waiver to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, the situation in Rajasthan is completely different
 rajasthan main bemausam barish aurolavrishtine pehle hi kisaanon ko maar rakhaa he or ab kisaanon ke hisse main lagaataar katautee ne karj baantne ke lakshya main hi katautee kar di he yani kisaanon ko doguni maar jhelni pad rahi he
 Farmers not showing interest in interestless loans
 Last year, the Rajasthan government had told that 26 thousand farmers will be linked with interest-free loans, but this time the farmers did not show a trend in it
 darasal naabard ke sahyog se sarkaar kisaanon byaaj rahit lone uplabdh karaati he
 The interest subsidy is available on timely repayment of the loan
 pradesh main yojana ke tahat kisaanon ko kabhi 17 hajaar karod die jate the lakin 2014 se sthiti badal rahi he
 In 2015-16, the government set a target of 14 thousand crores, but due to pressure from farmers, a loan of 15 thousand crores had to be given
 2016-17 main pichley ke mukaable 500 karod adhik kaa lakshya rakhaa lekin varsh ke ant main saadhe baarah hajaar karod kaa lone hi diya gaya
 Rajasthan government is also lagging behind in debt recovery and government is also lagging behind in recovery of loan
 pichley saal 70 pratishat vasuuli hui, lekin is varsh yah 37 pratishat hi rah gai yani saaf he ki kisaan lone chukaa paane kii sthiti main he hi nahin
 The government is yet to initiate the purchase at the support price
 kisaan kii fasal kii kharid ke bina vasuuli sambhav nahin he
 If the government does not extend the deadline, then interest will also be hit on the farmer because after the deadline, there is no relaxation of interest

 After the departure of Dinesh Trivedi, Mukul Roy took the oath of office of the new railway minister in a simple program held at Rashtrapati Bhavan today
 raashtrapati pratibha devi singh patil ne unhen yah shapath dilaai
 Only after this will Mukul Roy answer the discussion on the Railway Budget in Parliament
 mamata banerjee pehle bhi mukul raay ko hi railmantri bananaa chaahati thi lekin piem ne unhen rail rajya mantri banaaya
 During this time there was a railway accident in Assam in which he did not go to the spot on the pm's request, saying that the ministry is with the PM
 mukul roy kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki vah didi ke sabase bharosemand vyakti hai
 He does nothing without Didi's approval, is the General Secretary of the Trinamool Congress and has studied up to BSC Part One
 dinesh trivedi se ulat vah suraksha or badlaav kii baat karne kii bajaay yah baat karnaa pasand karte hai ki didi ne rail or bengal ko kis tarah badla
 Mukul, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2006, also played a very important role in the Assembly elections held in Bengal
 unhen mohan bagan ke footbal match or vanade cricket match dekhnaa pasand he
 Significantly, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamta Banerjee has finally succeeded in her cause
 pehle to unhone rail mantri pad se dinesh trivedi kii chuttee karne or apane kareebi mukul roy ko rail mantri kii nai jimmedaari saunpane ke liye pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko majaboor kiya
 She is now pressurizing the government to withdraw the passenger fare
 khud pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne loksabhaa main trivedi ke istife kii ghoshnaa kii or saath hi unki vidaai par khed bhi jataayaa
 Later, Mamata met Manmohan and forced Mukul Roy to become the new railway minister
 mukul roy aaj subah 10 baje bataur kendriya mantri shapath lenge
 He will be given the responsibility of Ministry of Railways
 abhi tak vah jahajrani rajya mantri hai
 He has also served as Minister of State in the Ministry of Railways
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav kaa jawaab dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhen trivedi ke pad chhodane kaa khed he
 He said that he got Trivedi's resignation late Sunday evening
 use manjuuri ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya gaya he
 Trivedi had presented the Rail Budget with the promise of taking forward the Vision-2020, which was set by his predecessor Mamta Banerjee
 iske pehle kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne sadan ko bataaya tha ki dinesh trivedi kaa istipha pradhanmantri ke paas vichaaradhin he
 Mamta told reporters after meeting the Prime Minister, "it was a good meeting
 
 The Prime Minister has the prerogative to withdraw the increase in railway passenger fares and make Mukul Roy the new railway minister
 " Mamta said that increasing the rent will increase the pressure on the common man
 unhone kaha, "ham aam aadmi ko prabhavit nahin karenge
 " mamata ne kaha ki unki party ne sarkaar se koi phayda nahin uthaaya
 His party had only one minister in the Union Cabinet while the other partners of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) have more ministers
 tippaniyan Mamta reached Delhi on Sunday
 pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke alaava unhone party sansadeey dal kii baithak main bhi hissaa liya
 It may be known that Mamta was angry with Trivedi only after the increase in passenger fare in the railway budget
 mamata ne pradhanmantri ko patr likhakar trivedi ko pad se hataane or mukul roy ko unke sthaan par laane kii maang bhi kii thi
 But Trivedi's attitude continued to rebel
 ravivaar ko bhi unhone kaha tha ki vah kisi kii jaagir nahin hai
 Mamta Banerjee also wanted to make Mukul Rai the railway minister earlier but the PM made her Minister of State for Railways
 is dauraan assam main rail haadase hua jisamen vah piem ke kehane par ghatnasthal yah kehete hue nahin gaye ki mantralay piem ke paas he
 Mukul Roy's biggest specialty is that he is the most trusted person of Didi
 vah didi kii manzuri ke bina kuch nahin karte trinmul congress ke mahasachiv hai or biessi part van tak padhe hai
 Unlike Dinesh Trivedi, he prefers to talk about how Didi changed rail and Bengal, instead of talking about security and change
 mukul 2006 main rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye is baar bengal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main unhone behad ahm bhoomika bhi nibhaai
 He likes to watch Mohun Bagan's football matches and ODI cricket matches
 gauratlab he ki pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri va trinmul congress pramukh mamata banerjee aakhir apane makasad main kaamyaab ho hi gayi
 First, he forced Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to leave Dinesh Trivedi as Railway Minister and entrust the new responsibility of Railway Minister to his close Mukul Roy
 ab vah yatri kiraaya waapas lene ke liye sarkaar par dabaav bana rahi hai
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself announced the resignation of Trivedi in the Lok Sabha and also regretted his departure
 baad main mamata ne manmohan se bhent kar mukul roy ko nayaa rail mantri banane par majaboor kiya
 Mukul Roy will take oath as Union Minister at 10 am today
 unhen rail mantralay kaa jimmaa saunpa jayega
 As of now he is the Minister of State for Shipping
 vah rail mantralay main bhi rajyamantri rah chuke hai
 Responding to the vote of thanks on the President's address, the Prime Minister said that he regretted leaving Trivedi's post
 unhone kaha ki unhen trivedi kaa istipha ravivaar der shaam mil gaya tha
 He has been sent to the President for approval
 trivedi ne vijan-2020 ko aage le jane ke vaade ke saath rail bajet pesh kiya tha, jise unki purvavarti mamata banerjee ne nirdhaarit kiya tha
 Earlier, Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had told the House that the resignation of Dinesh Trivedi is under consideration with the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri se mulaakaat ke baad mamata ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "yah acchhee mulaakaat rahi
 
 rail yatri kiraye main vruddhi waapas lene or mukul roy ko nayaa rail mantri banane kaa mudda pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar he
 " mamata ne kaha ki kiraaya badhane se aam aadmi par dabaav badhegaa
 He said, "we will not impress the common man
 " Mamta said that her party did not benefit from the government
 kendriya mantrimandal main unki party kaa keval ek hi mantri tha jabaki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ke anya sahyogiyon ke zyada mantri hai
 The comments mamata ravivaar ko dilli pahunchi thim
 Apart from meeting the Prime Minister, he also participated in the party parliamentary party meeting
 gyaat ho ki rail bajet main yatri kiraaya badaye jane ke baad se hi mamata trivedi se naaraaz thim
 Mamta had written a letter to the Prime Minister demanding removal of Trivedi from the post and replacing Mukul Roy in his place
 lekin trivedi ke tevar lagaataar bagawati bane rahe
 Even on Sunday, he had said that he is not the property of anyone
