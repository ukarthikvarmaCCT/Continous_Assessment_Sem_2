 dilli main ho rahi pani kii killat par congress party ne kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf mataka phod pradarshan kiya
 The Congress accused the Kejriwal government of having met the water mafia
 dilli congress pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan ke mutabik pani mafia se kejariwal sarkaar kii santhganth he
 In fact, the water shortage in the capital Delhi has created a political boil
 dilli congress bhi kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf sadakon par utar gai he
 Ajay Maken has accused the Kejriwal government that water of common man is being given to five-star hotels in a crackdown demonstration against the government in Rajendra Nagar
 ajay maakan ne kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar dilli main paanch sitara hotalon ko garibon ke hisse kaa pani de rahi he or kejariwal sarkaar ke sangrakshan main pani mafia dilli main pehle se zyada sakriy hokar kaam kar rahaa he
 The Delhi Congress rejected the argument of not getting water from Haryana
 pradesh adhyaksh maakan ke mutabik shila sarkaar ke vakt bhi haryana pani dene main anakani kiya karata tha lekin dilli main pani kii itani bhayankar killat kabhi bhi nahin hone di gai
 According to Maken, the Kejriwal government is using the dispute with the Haryana government to hide its failure
 jaahir he jaise-jaise badhati garmi apane tevar dikhaaegi dilli main pani kii killat kaa mudda raajnneetik ubaal kaa kaaran banegaa
 It is clear that the question will be asked directly to the Chief Minister and Water Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his silence for a long time will give the opposition a chance to be more aggressive

 Priyanka interacted with about 60 activists during this 45-minute meeting
 is dauraan priyanka ne kaaryakartaaon se gathbandhan ke bare main unki raay jaananaa chaahi
 It is interesting that Jyotiraditya Scindia is also taking his opinion about the alliance with the western region leaders
 baithak ke dauraan lagbhag sabhi kaaryakartaaon ne priyanka se joardaar aawaaj main gathbandhan naa karne kii baat kahi

 There will be no alliance with any party in UP
 ham modi sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane kaa kaam karenge

 The political controversy is growing against the statement of Delhi cabinet minister Kapil Mishra against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mangalvaar ko kapil mishra ne ek vivaadit twit kar kaha tha, "kya aaj hamen pradhanmantri ke rup main ek ISI agent mila he?" kapil mishra ne ye bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki kya pradhanmantri desh virdohi takaton ke saamne jhuk rahe hai? a befitting reply came from the Central Government on Wednesday

 After the alliance between Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha Election 2019, both the parties are going to hold a big rally on April 7
 Huh
 is raily main donon hi partiyaan shakti pradarshan karengi
 The special thing is that they have chosen Saharanpur for this rally
 bataa den ki 2014 tak yah ilaaka mayawati (mayawati) kaa mana jaataa tha
 The BSP (BSP) had won this parliamentary constituency twice in the last four elections
 lekin 2014 main modi lahar kii vajah se unhen yah seat gavaani padi
 Muslims constitute 42% of the total population of Saharanpur
 jabaki 22 fisadi log dalit hai
 The first test of akhilesh-mayawati alliance is going to be held in western UP
 is gathbandhan kaa naaraa he ki ek bhi vot naa batane denge, ek bhi vot naa ghatane denge
 Mayawati's supporters are mainly Jatav Dalit voters, who constitute half the total Dalit population living in the state
 2017 main saharanpur ke ek gaanv main upree jati or daliton ke bich dil dahalane vaali ghatana hui
 Due to which, after some time, riots also broke out in the area
 yah puraa ilaaka agle kai saptaah tak in dangon kii aanch main jhulasata rahaa
 Two people died in these riots
 marane waalon main ek dalit or doosraa thakur tha
 During the riots, the accused also set ablaze the houses of more than 50 Dalits against a procession by Dalits
 us dauraan bhim army ke pramukh chandrashekhar aaazaad (chandrashekhar Ravan) ko dangon kaa mukhya aaropee bataaya gaya tha
 Three months later, UP police arrested Azad from Himachal Pradesh
 upi sarkaar ne aaazaad par raashtra kii suraksha ke saath khilwaad karne ko lekar kai gambhir aarope lagaae the
 However, the government later withdrew all those charges
 aaazaad ko unki giraftaar ke 16 mahine baad jail se reeha kar diya gaya tha
 The former UP chief minister Mayawati was appalled by the growing popularity of Azad after the Saharanpur violence and the subsequent arrest of Azad
 unhen lagane laga tha ki yah yuva ab ek nae dalit netaa ke taur par ubhar rahaa he
 Azad founded the Bhim Army in 2015
 bhim army kii sthapana ke baad unka shuruaati makasad nichali jatike bacchon ko behatar shiksha dilaanaa tha
 However, at the same time this organization was also ready to raise the voice of Dalits and fight for the rights of Dalits
 isi dauraan gujarat ke oona main dalit yuvaaon ko mrit gaay le jane kii vajah pitayee kii ghatana saamne ai
 And Bhima Army also strongly opposed this incident
 bhim army chunaav main sakriy bhoomika nibhaane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he
 By September, 'ravana' was released from jail and his political standing had increased
 khaskar pashchimi uttar pradesh main, jahaan se sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tahat mayawati kii party kii kareeb aadhi siten aati hai
 Mayawati has always been apprehensive about Chandrasekhar half her age
 mayawati aarope lagaati rahi hai ki chandrashekhar bijepi kaa agent he joki aresas kii vichaardhaara se prerit he
 She has been saying that if Chandrashekhar was really concerned about the Dalits, he would have joined the BSP instead of setting up the Bhima Army
 vahiin chandrashekhar (chandrashekhar Ravan) ne enditivi se kaha ki modi or yogi shashan ke dauraan mujhe 16 maheene tak jail main rakhaa gaya, mere upar 43 jhuthe mukademe kara die gaye
 Chandrasekhar questioned how i can be the agent of the party that is trying to eliminate me
 priyanka gandhi wadra se mulaakaat par mayawati kii naaraazgi ko lekar chandrashekhar ne ek raily main kaha ki main unka bahut sammaan karata hum or kabhi aisa kaam nahin karuunga jisase dalit varg ko nuksaan ho
 But they have to believe in me
 priyanka gandhi or chandrashekhar kii mulaakaat ek aspataal main hui thi
 Azad was detained during a political procession
 jahaan unhone apane swasthya bigadane kii baat kahi, jiske baad unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 The Congress tried to show that, after Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati got out of the alliance, they have another charismatic Dalit leader
 aaazaad bhi yah dikhaanaa chaahate the ki vah koi maamuli khilaadi nahin hai
 Khalid Anis Ansari, a professor at a university in Saharanpur, says that in the last 2 years, Chandrasekhar's popularity has grown rapidly among Dalit youth and Muslims, which Uttar Pradesh's top political parties have not been able to ignore
 shaayad isi vajah se congress chandrashekhar se mulaakaat ke liye pahunchi thi
 a senior Congress leader told NDTV that the meeting was an investment for the future
 unhone kaha ki party ko 2022 main hone vaale uttar vidhansabha chunaav main nae taaje chehron kii talash he
 The Congress is trying to bring Dalit leaders into its political fold after the possibility of joining the historic alliance made by the BSP and SP for these elections is over
 isi kadi main pichley dinon savitribai phule ko congress main shaamil kiya gaya
 Many big BSP leaders are not contesting this time as their seats have gone to Akhilesh Yadav's part
 vipaksh ke samarthan se chandrashekhar varanasi main piem narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 mayawati-akhilesh Yadav has already rejected all speculation about including Congress in the alliance
 unka maananaa he ki maujuuda samay main congress kaa rajya main koi aadhaar nahin he or agar vah is loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko apane saath lete hai to isse bijepi ke khilaaf unki ladaai kamjor padegi
 Manoj Gautam, who joined the Bhima Army some time ago, believes that if there is any kind of talk between Chandrasekhar and the Congress in western UP, then the BSP-SP alliance will have to suffer
 unhone bataaya ki vah pehle basapa ke liye matdaan karte rahe hai
 Gautam will attend the big rally to be held in April
 unka maananaa he ki aaazaad ko aakhirkaar mayawati kaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 Gautam told NDTV that Chandrashekhar has made it clear what his motive is, with the announcement of fighting against PM Modi from Varanasi a few days ago
 yah ham sabhi ko pataa he ki piem narendra modi daliton ke dushman hai
 The oppression of Dalits will not stop during BJP rule, unless it is stopped
 agar basapa-sapa gathbandhan or congress kaa uddeshy ek hi he to unhen meraa samarthan karnaa chahie
 He said that after clarifying his intentions, Chandrasekhar had called Mayawati five times but did not get a single reply from her
 kuch samay pehle hi aaazaad ne kaha tha ki vah sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke saath-saath samaajit kaaryakarta ke taur par bhi kaam karte rahenge
 He told NDTV that there are two reasons for Azad to say so
 ek to bijepi netaa kaa vah bayaan he jisamen unhone ishaara kiya tha ki unki party samvidhan ko badalane kii taiyaari main he or duusari vajah, bijepi dwaara daliton ke saath kiye ja rahautyachaar hai
 Gautam said that in February this year, PM Modi visited the Sant Ravidas Temple in Varanasi
 main bhi us dauraan vahaan maujuud bheed main shaamil tha
 i saw how the people engaged in the protection of PM humiliated our religious leaders
 piem bahari the lekin ham bhakt hai jinhen apane hi mandir main chote hone kaa ehsaas karaayaa gaya
 Mayawati has been accusing Chandrasekhar of being an agent of BJP
 aaazaad piem modi ko ek kadi takkar denge yaa vipaksh unke saath khadaa hoga, ise lekar pashchimi upi main maujuud bhim army ke kaaryakartaaon ko koi ummid nahin he
 But still, he is giving his full support to Azad's big decision
 ek college chaatr ne kaha ki oonchi jati ke log hamaare netaaon ke saath shuru se hi barbarta purna vyahaar karte rahe hai
 These are the same people who interfere in all political parties
 satta ne mayawati ji ko bhi bhrasht bana diya he
 Now there is no difference between them and others
 chandrashekhar nai ummid kii tarah he
 Azad said the BJP had won 66 of the 84 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in the country in the 2014 general election
 inamen yipu ke kul 17 siten bhi shaamil hai
 Overall i will support the same candidate who can defeat BJP
 chaahe vah congress kaa ho yaa phir bispi-espi gathbandhan kaa
 Amitabh Bachchan does not hesitate to do anything new

 Rather it seemed as if he was enjoying a lot in this scooter ride

 See Yoyo Honey Singh and Bachchan's song for the film Bhootnath Returns bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa evam bihar ke up-mukhyamantri sushilmodi ne somvaar ko bada bayaan dete hue kaha ki bhaajapa kii aguwai vaala rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) rajya kaa aglaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi mukhyamantri evam jadyu adhyaksh nitish kumaar ke netritv main hi ladega

 Taking aim at the main opposition RJD, Sushil said that no one should be in any confusion, who would want to ride on the sinking Naiya
 unhone bihar main pichley 15 saal ke rajg shasankaal kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha ki baar-baar log hamaare (rajg) 15 saal ke shashan kaa zikr karte hai or vah (vipakshi) kehete hai ki hamaare pichley 15 saal kaa zikr sattapaksh kab tak karata rahegaa, to ab janata tay kare ki unke 15 saal main zyada kaam hua yaa ham logon ke 15 saal main zyada kaam hua
 Sushil Modi said that if those people had worked in their 15 years tenure and had built Bihar on a strong foundation, today we could have written the story of 3-4 storey development but those people would have made Bihar like a crematorium Left and went away
 unhone kaha ki janata tay karegi ki kis gathbandhan ne or kin logon ne 15 saal main behatar kaam kiya he
 Referring to the continuous absence of Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Sushil Modi alleged that today is the 17th day of the proceedings of the House but i am sad that the Leader of the Opposition may not have a word in the House Has spoken unhone kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki bihar ke sansadeey itihaas kaa yah pehla mauka hoga ki pratipaksh ke netaa ne na to bajet par charchaa yaa sadan kii kisi anya kaarywahi main bhaag liya

 com / b21wphqdjf— oneplus India (@oneplus_in)march 6, 2017 After first declaring Rashtriya Lok Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha as the chief ministerial candidate, his party has now proposed to contest 68 seats out of a total of 243 seats in front of the BJP leadership
 enditivi india se baatcheet main party ke pradhan sachiv or mukhya pravaktaa shivaraj singh ne kaha, 'hamane bijepi ke saamne ye prastaav rakhaa he ki 2010 main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 102 seat par chunaav ladaa tha jabaki algepi, jo us vakt alag gathvandhan ke saath thi, usne 74 par chunaav ladaa tha
 Now let us contest the remaining 67 seats out of 243
 ' siton kii khinchataan par lok janashakti party philhal chup he
 The Lok Janshakti Party, which has left the choice of nda's chief ministerial candidate in these elections, is not ready to open its cards with seats
 tippaniyan Party leader and MP Chirag Paswan told NDTV, 'discussion on this issue has not yet started in the Lok Janshakti Party
 abhi to ham ummidavaaron kaa akalan kar rahe hai
 In fact, the question of who should be the chief ministerial candidate from the NDA in Bihar assembly elections, how many seats should be given to which constituent party, is a complicated question and there is no consensus among the parties
 ab ye dekhnaa ahm hoga ki bijepi leadership sahyogiyon ke raajnneetik mol-tol se kaise nipatni he
 Speaking to NDTV India, the party's Principal Secretary and Chief Spokesperson Shivraj Singh said, 'we have proposed to the BJP that in the last assembly election in 2010, BJP contested 102 seats while LJP, which at that time had a separate alliance Together, she contested 74
 ab 243 main se baaki kii 67 siton par hamen chunaav ladane diya jaae
 'lok Janshakti Party is currently silent on the pull of seats
 in chunaavon main endie ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar kii pasand bijepi par chhod chuki lok janashakti party abhi siton ko lekar apane pattey kholane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The comments party ke netaa or saansad chiraag paswan ne enditivi se kaha, 'lok janashakti party main is mudde par abhi charchaa nahin shuru hui he
 Right now we are assessing the candidates
 darasal, bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main endie kii taraf se mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar koun ho, kis ghatak dal ko kitni siten di jaae ye sawaal pechida he or is par partiyon ke andar bhi aam raay nahin he
 Now it will be important to see how to deal with the political negotiation of BJP leadership partners

 com / j78vd30why— indianpremierleague (@ipl)may 1, 2015 In response to a question raised on the demonetisation announcement, the Central Government has told the Supreme Court that the speech of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not bigger than the law
 bharat sarkaar ke atorni general mukul rohtagi ne mangalvaar court ko bataaya ki notebandi ke elaan ke baad 30 disambar kii dedline kanoon ke mutabik he
 At the same time, PM Modi's promise to make this date December 31 is not bigger than this law
 yah sawaal supreme court kii bench ke saamne ai ek yachika se uthaa he
 In this petition, the Central Government and the Reserve Bank are accused of retracting the promise made at the time of declaration of ban
 supreme court ne donon kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank ko notice jari kar maamle main jawaab maanga tha
 One of the petitioners had approached the court questioning the provision of penalty on depositing old currency that PM Modi had promised in his speech on 8 November 2016 while announcing the demonetisation
 notebandi ke faisle main 30 disambar 2016 tak pratibandhit kii gai karency ko bank main jamaa karaane kii dedline tay kii thi
 But PM Modi promised that the citizen who cannot deposit the banned currency with him for this period for some reason, will get a chance to deposit this currency with the Reserve Bank by 31 March 2017
 notebandi ke elaan ke baadarijrv bankne bhi apane circular main kaha tha ki puraani karency ko 31 march tak rigerv bank main jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 However, he had conditioned the depositors in the Reserve Bank to explain the reason why the said currency was not deposited by the deadline of 30 December 2016
 chif justise jagadish singh khehar kii adhyakshata vaali bench ne is maamle main agali sunwaayee 11 april kii tay kii he
 The bench in the court also sought information from the petitioner whether he was not in India till December 30, 2016, the fixed period of demonetisation
 vahiin court ne sarkaar se yah bhi poocha he ki aakhir kyon kendra sarkaar ne kyon nagarikon ko 31 march 2017 tak pratibandhik karency ko nahin jamaa karne diya
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked 123 deemed universities to remove the university from its name
 ujisi ke anusaar 123 ucch shikshan sansthaanon ko ek maheene ke andar 'vishvavidhyalay' naam hatana hoga
 At the same time, after removing the name, these educational institutions can use 'deemed to be university'
 aaie dekhte hai in 123 sansthaanon main kis-kis kaa naam shaamil he

 But zia-ul-haq did not say this in the country because he believed that in such a situation, anger would arise in the country against him
 lekin tabhi unke DGMO ne jiya ul haq ko ek plan bataaya or kaha ki ham siachin waapas le sakate hai
 According to DGMO, if we withdraw Siachen, then there will be no problem in it
 kyonki jis tarah hindustan ne sardiyon main kabja kiya, ham bhi agali sardi main aisa kar sakate hai
 zia-ul-haq asked if India would not retaliate
 nazam sethi bataate hai ki DGMO ne samajhaayaa ki ham siachin main jaaenge to kashmir border par firing ho sakati he aise main ham vahaan par mujahiddeen ko bhadkaa sakate hai
 But zia-ul-haq did not like this plan and the matter was postponed
 pakistani patrkaar nazam sethi ke mutabik, agar 1999 kii baat karen tab pakistan main parvej musharraf army chif the
 And they had a group called 'gang of For'
 usamen parvej musharraf ke alaava general ajij (kashmir ilaake ke head), general mahmud or brigadier javed hasan shaamil the
 Nazam Sethi said that these four people made the plan when Nawaz sharif-atal Bihari Vajpayee was about to start the bus service in 1998, but Parvez Musharraf did not approve it
 tab gang of for ne apane plan par aage badhane kii thaanee
 Pakistani journalist said in the interview that in October 1998 he approved the plan, in January 1999, 200 people were trained and asked to be sent over
 pehle target tha ki bharat ke 10 post kabjaayenge, lekin upar gaye to puraa ilaaka khaali tha or baad main or zyada logon ko bulaayaa gaya
 According to Nazam Sethi, India was suspected in May and later also attacked

 Such speeches and speeches may have alienated the crowd, but has anyone ever touched issues in his voice that sound dull compared to others?

 Congress President Ahul Gandhi on Monday surrounded the Prime Minister on this issue and called him Commander in Thief (commander of Thieves)
 rahul gandhi ne ek video twit kiya, jisameraffel dilke bare main samajhaayaa ja rahaa he
 The person in the video is saying that former French President François Hollande spoke about the Rafael deal, that the name of Ambani's company was suggested by the Indian government and that they had no choice
 isse pehle congress adhyaksh ne raksha mantrinirmala sitaramanpar rafel deal ko lekar hamalaa bolaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi took on the defense minister for not giving the contract of Rafale aircraft deal to the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)
 rahul ne is bare main twit kar nirmala par 'jhooth bolne' kaa aarope lagaaya

 Former head of HAL TS Raju has exposed his falsehood that HAL does not have the capability to make Rafale
 'rafel mudde par har din nai-nai baaten or nae-nae aarope saamne aa rahe hai
 In this case, let us know what happened in this deal
 - saal 2007 main vayusena kii ore se medium multi role combat aircraft (MMRCA) kharidne kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja gaya
 After this, the Indian government issued a tender to purchase 126 fighter aircraft

 However, Rafael of Dassault Aviation won
 - 4 sitambar 2008 ko reliance group ne reliance airospes technologies limited (RATL) naam se ek nai company banaai

 - The deal to buy Rafale could not be finalized during the UPA regime
 haalanki congress party daawa karti he ki usne 526
 1 crore per Rafale aircraft was negotiated
 yah saaf nahin hua tha ki Dassault bharat kii jaruraton ke mutabik in vimaanon ko tay vakt main uplabdh karaayega yaa nahin
 The reason for this is that the deal was not completed during the UPA regime
 - iske baad endie satta main ai or 28 march 2015 ko anil ambani ke netritv memriliancedefence company banaai gai
 - On 10 April 2015, PM Modi visited the French capital Paris and announced his government's decision to purchase 36 Rafale fighter jets ready for flight

 According to the French newspaper Media Part, the investment was made through an investment fund of a French man who had known Ambani for the last 25 years
 haalanki, juli gayet ke production rog international ne anil ambani yaa reliance ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat karne kii baat ko khaarij kar diya
 - On September 2016, the final deal for the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft between India and France was signed

 For a great player like Sachin Tendulkar, history has repeated itself once again
 mumbai indiens team ne ravivaar ko jaise hi ipel khitaab jeeta, yuva khilaadiyon ne sachin ko kandhe par baitaakar eden gardens stadium ke chakkar lagaae
 a similar view was seen at the Wankhede Stadium two years ago
 varsh 2011 main jab bhartiya cricket team ne mahendra singh dhauni ke netritv main 28 saal ke baad isisi vishwacap (50 over) kaa khitaab jeeta tha, tab team ke kai sadasyon ne sachin ko kandhe par baitaakar stadium ke chakkar lagaae the or ab jabaki mumbai indiens ne chathe prayaas main ipel khitaab jeeta, tab bhi unke yuva saathiyon ne isi tarah se unka sammaan kiya
 Time had stopped in Eden for Sachin
 vah final main bhale hi nahin khele lekin kisi anya khilaadi kii tarah badalte halaat ke saath-saath unke chehre ke haavbhaav badalte rahe
 He was as active during the entire match as the players involved in the playing XI
 sachin chot ke kaaran kwalifire-1, kwalifire-2 or fainal main nahin khel sake
 Sachin retired retired during the league match with Sunrisers Hyderabad about 10 days ago and after that he did not play a single match in the IPL
 sachin ne apane 20 saal se bhi lambe kariyar main sab kuch hasil kiya
 With many records to his name, Sachin was active and the Indian and his club teams took first place in the Twenty20 World Cup (though he was not a member of the team), the 50-over World Cup, the IPL title and the Test order
 is tarah do saal pehle tak khitaabon se sukhi sachin kii jholii ab puri tarah bhar chuki he
 The comments yahi sochakar sachin ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah ab ipel main nahin khelenge
 Sachin did not play international Twenty20 cricket
 unke naam sirf ek match darj he lekin ipel ne sachin ko lagaataar do maheenon tak khelte hue khud ko pratispardhi cricket ke liye feet rahane kaa mauka diya
 He retired from one-day cricket and also left the professional Twenty20 league
 ab vah sirf test maichon main bharat ke liye khelte dikhenge
 This means that now cricket fans will get very few chances to see Sachin play

 sachin ke liye vakt eden main tham gaya tha
 He may not have played in the finals but his face changes with changing circumstances like any other player
 vah puure match ke dauraan utane hi sakriy najar aae, jitne kii antim-ekadash main shaamil khilaadi the
 Sachin could not play in qualifier-1, qualifier-2 and final because of injury
 lagbhag 10 din pehle sunrisers hyderabad ke saath hue lig match ke dauraan sachin ritred hart ho gaye or uske baad unhone ipel main ek bhi match nahin khelaa
 Sachin achieved everything in his 20-year-long career
 anekon ricard apane naam kar chuke sachin ke sakriy rahete hue bhartiya or unki club tiimon ne twanti-20 vishwa cap (vah haalanki team ke sadsy nahin the), 50 over vishwa cap, ipel khitaab or test variyata kram main pehla sthaan hasil kiya
 Thus, two years ago, Sachin's bag of titles is now fully filled
 tippaniyan Thinking this, Sachin announced that he will no longer play in the IPL
 sachin ne antarrashtriya twanti-20 cricket khelaa hi nahin
 He has just one match to his name but the IPL gave Sachin an opportunity to be fit for competitive cricket by playing for two consecutive months
 vah ek-divasiy cricket se sanyas le chuke hai or peshewar twanti-20 lig bhi chhod diya

 The next Lok Sabha election is less than a year away, but the country's oldest national party faces extremely disturbing figures
 desh kii kul 31 vidhansabhaon main se congress ab mahaj teen rajyon main hi bahumat main rah gai he—punjab, puduccheri or mizoram
 There are a total of 4,120 assembly seats across the country, out of which only 727 seats are Congress mlas
 paanch vidhansabhaon main congress kaa ek bhi vidhayak nahin he
 Congress is not even represented in the Lok Sabha from 15 states and the Congress governments have remained on only two per cent of the total area of the country
 isse ulat duusari rashtriya party bhaajapa desh ke 19 rajyon main satta par kabiz he
 It has emerged as the single largest party by winning 104 seats in the 224-member Karnataka Assembly

 Nevertheless, the Congress president is keen to challenge Modi in 2019
 karnataka kii haar is baat kaa ishaara he ki congress ne yaa to pichhali kai shikast se bhi koi khaas sabak nahin liya yaa jo sabak liya he, use amal main laane main dhilaai baratati rahi
 The Congressional central leadership's pre-election and post-election approach is an example of this
 jis din karnataka ke chunaav parinaam ghoshit ho rahe the us dopaher upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi se milane unke dilli sthit sarkari awaas par pahunchin
 This is a sign of how worried the top leadership of the Congress was that day

 Kumaraswamy had no hesitation in proposing the post of Chief Minister
 sonia ne siddharamaiya ko sakht nirdesh diya ki ve devegoda ke ghar jaaen or unase haath milaayein
 Many people in the Congress are shouting out that i wish! Had Sonia given Siddaramaiah an order to hand over Deve Gowda before the election, the situation would have been different today
 pradesh main party ke varisht netaa bhi chaahate the ki congress jad (es) ke saath chunaav-purv gathbandhan kare lekin rahul ne siddharamaiya ko puri chhot de rakhi thi
 Siddaramaiah was so confident in himself that he was not listening to anyone

 Modi's Kashi Parikrama continued for four hours
 road sho ke duusare round kaa clymex kaashi viapeeth main hua jahaan piem ne raily kii or akhilesh-rahul par kuch karaare taaje waar kiye
 On a good day, Modi, addressing a public meeting at Kashi with the Kashi Vidyapith University ground, said, "the previous governments have been only maneuvering over the development of Banaras and their aim is only to win the elections
" lekin in tikadamon se banaras kaa kuch nahin ho sakaa
 Modernization of Banaras, its rejuvenation is needed and my dream is to transform Benaras into a world-class modern city
 ' modi ne kaha ki banaras ke log is shahar ko duniya kii kalpanaaon kaa shahar banaaya ja saktaa he, iske liye sirf avarodhon ko dur karnaa hoga
 PM Modi's 'apnaan' from Kashi said, 'people have a desire to visit Banaras at least once in their lives, because Banaras is not a city, but a living legacy'
 piem ne kaha, 'espi, bispi, congress ek duusare kii buraai karte the, lekin ek baat par teenon ikatthe ho gaye
 November 8 night when he decided to ban demonetisation '
 piem ne kaha ki 70 saal tak jisane desh ko lutaa he use ab lautaanaa hi padegaa
 He alleged that Akhilesh worked in UP in a vote-wise manner

 Even on Sunday night, the Prime Minister will spend in Varanasi
 piem modi 2012 kaa record durust karne par amada dikh rahe hai, kyonki varanasi unki sansadeey seat he, kyonki 2012 main bijepi ne 8 main se sirf teen siten jiti thim, kyonki yahaan clin sweep nahin hua to yahi kaha jayega ki janata ne piem ke chehre ko nahin duusare muddo ko tavajjo diya
 That is why the PM is standing here and you can say that Modi threw himself here to make Kashi a thornless person

 This is no less important election for the Muslims of Varanasi
 piem modi ko kaashi main jeet pasand he
 But Kashi's victory will not be effective without winning UP
 upi jeetna modi ke liye unke kai mantriyon ke liye bhi jaruri he
 Therefore, the camp of a dozen ministers of Modi cabinet is also deposited here

 Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary, a seven-time MLA from Varanasi Dakshin seat, is not yet full of heartache
 khud piem modi kaa maraham bhi kargar nahin rahaa
 The results of UP will also test the base of many of Modi's cabinet ministers

 Satyanarayan Singh contested this seat in the 1967 election on a Communist Party ticket and won the seat by winning the Congress

 upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha he ki badali hui paristhitiyon main purv nirdhaarit maanakon main parivartan karbihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darjamilnaa chahie
 In his address during a seminar titled 'bihar Mange Insaaf', Modi said that the Government of India has mentioned five criteria to give special status to a state
 modi ne kaha ki in maapdandon main vishesh rajya kaa darja paane vaale pradesh ko pahari or durgam kshetra hona chahie, aabaadi kaa ghanatv kam ho, jis rajya kii simaaen antarrashtriya seemaa se judi hon evam samrik mahatv kaa ho, aarthik or aadharbhoot sanrachana kii drushti se pichhadaa ho or rajya apane sansaadhan se apana vikaas nahin kar saktaa ho
 He said that the Government of India has accorded special status to 11 states and its biggest benefit is the exemption from excise tax and income tax to the industrialists there
 modi ne kaha ki iskaa teesraa sabase bada laabh centre pryojit yojanon main rajyon dwaara rajyansh ke rup main lagaayi jaani vaali raashi main chhot ke taur mil jaati he
 He said that at present, Bihar has to invest about three to four thousand crore rupees in centrally sponsored schemes as state
 modi ne kaha ki kisi rajya ko vishesh darja die jane ko lekar jo maapdand nirdhaarit kiya gaya he vah koi cabinet kaa faisla nahin or na hi uskaa samvidhan main ullekh he balki yah ek raajnneetik faisla he, isliye isamen badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that if the population in a state is less then it can get special state status because of it, but if the density of population in a state is very high then why cannot it be given this status
 modi ne kaha ki bihar main ek varg kilometre main 1,120 log rahete hai jo duniya main sarvaadhik hoga jabaki bharat main prati varg kilometre main aabaadi ghanatv saade teen sau he
 He said that there is a shortage of hilly areas in Bihar, but 23 out of 38 districts here are flood affected due to which their entire infrastructure is destroyed every year
 modi ne kaha ki aise main in kshetron ko durgam kshetron ke rup main rekhaankit kiya ja saktaa he
 Bihar is also connected to the international border due to which its importance increases further
 unhone kaha ki is rajya main aarthik or aadharbhoot sanrachanaon tathaa apane aantarik sansadhano kii bhi kami he aise main bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene main centre sarkaar kii anakani bematlab or bemaani he
 Modi said that if Bihar gets special state status then a large number of entrepreneurs will come here to set up industries

 dilli ke jagatpuri ilaake main badmaashon ne ghar main ghuskar bujurg mahila or uski bahu ko bandhak banaakar do ghante tak lutpaat kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 On opposing the robbery, the miscreants stabbed the elderly woman and tied the hands and feet of the two and put a cloth in the mouth
 soochna milane par police maukey par pahunchi
 The matter is being investigated
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jagatpuri ilaake main somvaar kii der raat ghar ke andar ek chor ne bujurg mahila or uski bahu ko bandhak banaakar lutpaat kiya
 People in and around the house do not know about the incident, for this, the TV ran into the house and raised the voice
 bujurg mahila ne jab lut kaa virodh kiya to uske upar chaaku se hamalaa karke galaa dabaa diya
 According to the victim, the miscreants left the house comfortably after looting the house for about two hours
 iske baad un donon ne munh se kapadaa hataakar shor machaaya
 Neighbors reached there and informed the police
 maukey par pahunchi police team ne cese darj karke jaanch shuru kar di he

 pani ke istemaal par ab trephic kii tarah niyantran rakhane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 In 2019, the country has witnessed a heat of 51 degrees and a large part has been in the grip of drought
 bundelkhand, maharashtra, gujarat, madhyapradesh main log pani ke liye maare maare phir rahe hai
 Chennai is flooded with water and the Tamil Nadu High Court has reprimanded the state government for doing nothing
 monsoon teen-chaar maheene rahata he or iske baad desh kaa bada hissaa bhoojal yaa prakritik sansadhano main ekatra pani ke bharose rahata he
 There is a shortage of water in the central, southern and western regions of the country before the monsoon
 kendriya bhoojal board kii report kahati he ki 2017 main monsoon purv desh main saamaanya taur par paanch se das meter kii gaharaai par pani nikalataa tha
 This included exceptions from Delhi, Chandigarh and Rajasthan where water drains at 40 meters
 desh main sabase zyada gaharaai 130 meter se zyada par bikaner main bhoojal nikalataa he
 The board has concluded these findings on the basis of data received from more than 23 thousand monitoring centers in the country
 report main desh ke kareeb saadhe 13 hajaar kuon ke do saal ke monsoon purv akalan se ye bhi pataa chalata he ki 48 fisadi kuon main pani kaa str ghatata he or itane kuon main hi badhata he
 Incidence increases both occur in the range of 2 to 4 meters
 lekin chetavanee vaali baat ye he ki 2007 se 2017ke das saalon ke dauraan desh ke 61 fisadi kuon ke jalastr main giravat darj hui or inamen se 43 fisadi kaa pani do meter tak neeche chalaa gaya
 This decline has been reported in almost all the states
 jaahir he ye giravat hi chintaa kaa sabab he
 The 23rd report of the Parliament's Standing Committee on Water Resources (2017-2018) quoted the NITI Aayog as saying that 60 crore people of the country face drinking water crisis and demand of water in the country for the next 10 years i

 2030 Will double
 bhayankar pani kii kami se jidipi main 6 fisadi tak kii kami aane kaa andeshaa jataayaa gaya he
 85 per cent of the available water in the country is used in agriculture and out of this 65 per cent of the ground water is used in farming and only 6 per cent water is used for drinking and domestic use
 bharat main kheti ke liye duniya main sabase zyada pani kaa istemaal hota he or isaki vajah paidaavaar ke paramparaagat tareeke hai
 The packaged water industry is using 3% water
 desh main pani kii kami nahin iske prabandhan kaa abhaav he
 There should be laws for management
 jameen kii tarah pani rajya kaa vishay he
 Groundwater conservation laws are in force in only about a dozen states
 dikkat darasal soch main he
 According to the laws of the British era, the owner of the land is also the owner of the water below the ground
 lekin supreme court ne kai faislon main spasht kar diya he ki bhoojal kaa dohan sarkaar kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr nahin hoga
 The government owns ground water
 uttar pradesh main uttar pradesh bhoojal (prabandhan or niyantran) vidheyak 2017 taiyaar he lekin pataa nahin kyon abhi tak yogi adityanath kii bhaajapa sarkaar ne ise vidhansabha main laane kii manjuuri nahin di he
 If this bill is implemented, permission will have to be obtained from the government to remove ground water in UP, industries will also have to tell how much water will be extracted daily
 iske liye shulk bhi sarkaar vasuulegi
 There will be strong ground water management committees from block level to state level
 pani nikaalane kii anumati ke alaava kuen sookhne kii jaankaree bhi in samitiyon ko deni hogi
 The government will notify water scarcity areas
 bill ke praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan karne vaale ko jail se lekar jurmaane tak kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 The question is when will this be applicable
 bhoojal str main giravat ke alaava iske pradooshit or aswasthkar hone kii chintaaen alag hai
 Fluoride levels in 224 districts of the country are running above the standard and Rajasthan has the highest 30 districts
 isi tarah arsenic kaa str 10 rajyon ke 80 jilon main maanak se adhik he or isamen sabase zyada upi ke 20, assam ke 18, bihar ke 15 or haryana ke 13 jile shaamil hai
 One reason for this is the chemical water coming out of the factories
 ise bhi rokane ke intjaam nahin dikhte hai
 Actually, the weather of governments and political will in the country is also like the weather
 bheeshan garmi hogi to sab chillane lagate hai or jal sangrakshan or uplabdhta kii baaten uthati hai lekin maheene bhar baad jaise hi barish hoti he sab pani kii kami ko bhuulakar baadh or jalairao kii baaten karne lagate hai
 The political will that must be seen to come out of this perception is not yet visible
 pani ke prabandhan main kheti kii aadhunik takneekon kaa istemaal, bhoojal richarge ke abhiyaan or talabon or nadiyon kii safai or gaharaai badhaakar kiya ja saktaa he
 Governments will have to be strict for this

 Engineer said during the 'talk Show' organized by Legends Club at Cricket Club of India here, 'did you read Harbhajan's comment about Ashwin, that was not right there
 pehla spinner or doosraa spinner kya he? spinner aakhirkaar spinner hi he
 "engineer who was the number one wicketkeeper in the country from the 1960s to the early 1970s said," Ashwin is a great bowler
 mujhe aisa laga ki vah (harbhajan) aswin kii aalochana kar rahaa tha

 yah aisa hi he jaise (mahendra singh) dhoni (rishabh) pant kii aalochana karen

 He said, 'his (pant's) way is the same as MS Dhoni, but don't praise him so much at this time
 use protsaahit kiijie
 But that is technically incorrect
 'pant ne australia main sidney main drow hue antim test main ek shandaar shatak bhi jadaa jisase vah aisa karne vaali pehle bhartiya wicketiper ban gaye

 ) gujarat kii purv governor kamala beniwal ne pad par rahete hue sarkari vimaan kaa khub durupyog kiya
 Records from Gujarat Raj Bhavan show that Beniwal went out of state 63 times in three years by a government plane
 isamen se zyaadaatar daure unke grih rajya rajasthan ke the or ve sarkari vimaan se hameshaa jaipur jaaya karti thim
 An example of how much Beniwal misused the government aircraft is that he spent 83 hours in the air in 2011-12, 91 hours in 2012-13 and 102 hours in 2013-14
 87 varshiya beniwal abhi mizoram kii governor hai
 She visited Ahmedabad from Jaipur 53 times in three years and visited Delhi 10 times during her deployment to Gujarat
 dilachasp baat yah he ki unke dauron ko oficial bataaya gaya taaki vimaan kaa muft upyog kiya ja sake or unhen tamaam suvidhaayen tathaa bhatte milte rahen
 She remained out of the state for 497 days from 2010 until she stepped down
 haalanki yah kahana mushkil he ki is tarah ke dauron par kya kharch aata he lekin bharosemand sutron ne bataaya ki beniwal kaa har daura dedh karod rupee kaa hota tha yani us par lagbhag itane kaa kharch aata he
 Beniwal's every visit to Jaipur was said to be official, whereas only his visit to Delhi was official
 beniwal ke tamaam hawaii dauron main se sirf 12 ko privet bataaya gaya
 She lived out of the state on an average of 100 days each year
 ye aankade gujarat raaj bhawan se liye gaye hai or inaki chaanbin ho rahi he
 Beniwal had a bitter relationship with the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 lokayukta or kuch kanoonon ke bare main donon main kaaphi matbhed rahe
 Beniwal was sent as the Governor of Mizoram as soon as Modi came to power
 unhone 9 july ko ahmedabad choda
 However his term ended in November itself
 unhone kai mahatvapurn bilon ko roke rakhaa or kuch vidheyakon ko to ve teen saal dabaae baithe raheen
 It was his nature to sit down with every bill
 jab beniwal kaa tabadalaa mizoram hua tha to unhone use rukvane kii puri koshish kii
 But they had to leave
 modi se takaraav ke dauraan beniwal unase bina raay liye hue ritred justise aare mehta ko gujarat kaa lokayukta banane kii adhisuchana jari kar di
 Against this, the state government took refuge in the court, but when it became a matter, it went to the Supreme Court, which upheld the Governor's decision
 lekin justise mehta khud hi isse baahar ho gaye
 After this, Modi put forward the name of another gentleman

 If anyone tries to threaten someone, the government will take action against him

 Result by the BCCI: suspension for the ongoing series against Aussies and the next one against the Kiwis
 But i want to ask all of you, is that a right decision to do
 They damn sure made some unacceptable comments on the show, but we all know what the nature of the show is
 They must have said some things which are not acceptable by many but that's their personal life
 There is no point of connecting their personal life with their professional life
 Parties, friends, girls are part of their personal life and cricket is their professional one
 And it would be better if everyone does not mix it both
 i just wanna say that banning them from playing for their country just because of some talk show is not right
 If they want to learn from their mistakes they will do so without being banned and if not then no punishment can make them better
 Both the players are important for the Indian team and banning them will harm Indian cricket only like it did to Aussies after they banned Warner and Smith
 Hardik’s and kl’s behaviour should be criticised and they should be punished in some other way, i just wanna say that banning them is not the solution
 Write to us in our comment section what you think about this whole episode

 Of these, Newton is the only film that has managed to make up for its budget
 newton ne guuruuvaar tak 11
 83 has earned Rs
 lekin ab family antertainer film judwa 2 ko box offis par mil rahe shandaar rispons ke baad newton kii kamai par bhi asar pad saktaa he

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) September 29, 2017 While big budget films Bhoomi and Hasina are already lagging behind Newton in terms of earnings
 bhoomi relies ke pehle hafte 10 karod rupee kii hi kamai darj kar pai he
 Talk about Haseena's collection at the same time, according to reports, the film made 6 in its first week
 50 karod ru kii kamai kii he
 After the twin 2's reaction, it is clear that the coming days can prove to be worse for Hasina and the land
 donon filmein box offis par tik bhi paaengi ye bhi kahana ab mushkil lag rahaa he
 Twins Can Make Apart from the positive response of new recorders at the box office, there are many more factors that can make a twin film a hit film such as: 1
 akeli phillakeli film se matlab he ki is hafte bollywood se sirf yahi ek film relies ho rahi he
 There is no big film in front of it to compete
 beete hafte relies huin bhoomi, newton or hasina parker ko darshakon kaa khaas rispons nahin mila he
 In such a situation, most people will take the initiative to take the dose of entertainment
 2
 The long weekend will not end on the weekend
 relies ke shuukravaar se somvaar tak logon kii chhuttiyaan hai
 This is the biggest benefit for the film to be released on the occasion of Dussehra
 navami, dashahra or sande ke baad somvaar ko gandhi jayanti kii vajah se bhi chuttee rahane vaali he
 In such a situation, more and more viewers are expected to reach the theater
 3
 Varun Dhawan's career graph The above two reasons are guaranteed to make the film a box office hit, but apart from this, Varun Dhawan's career graph can also be considered as one of the reasons
 varun ne ab tak ke kariyar main aath filmein kii hai
 Most of them have done a very good collection at the box office
 aise main kamedi, content or mujeec kii acchhee saajhedaari se bani is film ko bhi hit kii ganrti mana ja rahaa he
 4
 salmaan factorfilm ke saath pehle hi salmaan factor judaa he
 The generation, who had enjoyed twins with Salman in the 90s, would also like to see its remake
 phir salmaan bhi isamen chemiyo kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, it would be a bonus for the audience to see the twin then and now
 5
 Comedy is said that today's audience likes comedy movies more
 phir festival kaa mauka bhi he, aise main log aisi film dekhnaa miss nahin karnaa chahenge, jiskaa majaa wo puure parivaar ke saath baithkar le saken
 Star casts like Varun Dhawan, Taapsee Pannu, Jacqueline Fernandez, comedy dosas, fun music and good story have all the essentials associated with a masala film
 phir aakhir koi ise kaise miss karegaa! Pakistan is not backing down from supporting terrorist activities
 lekin aatankwaad ke samarthan kaa ye adiyal rukh pakistan ke liye baari pad saktaa he
 The way the statements are being made by the US and India in the last few days, it seems that both countries can take some major action against Pakistan
 america de rahaa he kadi chetavaniamerica baar-baar pakistan ko cheta rahaa he
 The US said that if Pakistan does not eliminate the safe havens of the terrorists and does not improve, then it will be taught a lesson
 america rakshaamantri gym mattis ne kaha ki raashtrapati donald trump pakistan ke saath ek baar or kaam karne ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin agar vah apane taur tareeke nahin badalata or aatanki sanghathanon ko samarthan dena jari rakhata he, to uske khilaaf har jaruri karrwai ko taiyaar hai
 Will isolate Pakistan gave a strong warning to Pakistan that if it does not take action against the safe haven of terrorists on its soil, it can be 'diplomatically isolated' globally
 saath hi usase gaiyr-nato (MNNA yani major naan nato elaay) sahyogi kaa darja chhina ja saktaa he
 Air Force can bid - Nuclear Center Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Thursday that the Indian Air Force is fully prepared for war even on short notice
 ham anya force ke saath milakar yuddh ke liye bilkul taiyaar hai
 He said that our Air Force is capable of destroying Pakistan's nuclear facilities
 donon front ke liye taiyaarchin ke mudde par dhanoa ne kaha ki china ke khilaaf hamaari kshamta paryaapt he
 He said that if there is a fight on two front we will need 42 squadrons
 dhanoa ne bataaya ki hamaare paas plan b taiyaar he
 So far, we have never fought on two fronts simultaneously
 saath aae hai bharat-americagauratlab he ki china kii pakistan se badhati dosti ko takkar dene ke liye bharat or america saath hai
 Recently, the US supported India on the issue of china-pakistan Economic Corridor being built under China's One Road One Belt Mission
 US ne kaha tha ki china kaa ye project vivaadit kshetra se hokar guzar rahaa he

 com / ejm1lzubdr chandigarh shahar se guzarane vaale haive ko dinotiphoi karne ke maamle main supreme court ne enjio arive sef india kii yachika khaarij kar di he
 This order of the Supreme Court will also affect other states where highways pass through the city like the city road
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha agar state haive city ko dinotiphoi kiya gaya he to isamen kuch galat nahin he
 Because trains do not run at high speed in the city
 supreme court ne kaha hamaara aadesh bilkul saaf he ki neshnal or state hai ve ke 500 meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaane nahin hongi
 In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had remarked that if a state passes through the middle of the city and if it is denotified it will not be wrong at first sight
 kyonki shahar ke bich se gaadiya aam taur par dhimi raftaar se chalati hai
 There are many differences between highways within the city and highways outside the city
 haive kaa matlab he jahaan tej raftaar main gaadiyaan chalati hon
 The Supreme Court said that the purpose of our order was that liquor should not be available near the highway because people drink alcohol and drive fast and accidents happen
 darasal chandigarh main kai jagah haive kaa naam badalakar 'major distric road' kaa naam kar diya gaya he
 For this, an NGO called Arrival Safe India has filed a petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne haive par sharaab kii dukaanon ko band karne kaa faisla janhit main liya tha kyonki isse sadak durghatnaayen hoti hai
 In such a situation, the notification of March 16, 2017 by the Chandigarh administration to nullify the order of the Supreme Court is illegal and should be canceled
 haalanki punjab evam haryana hoicourt is yachika ko khaarij kar chukaa he
 During the hearing of the case, the Supreme Court said that if the State Highway City has been denotified then there is nothing wrong in it
 kyonki shahar main tej raftaar se gaadiyaan nahin chalatin
 The Supreme Court said that our order is very clear that there will be no liquor shops within 500 meters of the National and State Highways
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne tippanee kii thi ki agar koi state haive city ke bich se hokar gujarata he or agar use dinotiphoi kiya jaataa he to pehali najar main galat nahin hoga
 Because trains from the middle of the city usually run at a slow speed
 city ke andar ke haive or city ke baahar ke haive main bahut antar he
 Highway means where high speed vehicles move
 supreme court ne kaha hamaare aadesh kaa uddeshy sirf yah tha ki haive ke paas sharaab uplabdh na ho kyonki log sharaab pikar teji se gaadi chalaate hai or durghatana ho jaati he
 In fact, the name of the highway has been changed to 'major District Road' in many places in Chandigarh
 isi ko lekar arive sef india naamak enjio ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court had taken a decision in public interest to close liquor shops on the highway as it leads to road accidents
 aise main chandigarh prashasan kaa supreme court ke aadesh ko nishprabhavi karne ke liye 16 march 2017 kaa notification avaidh he or radd kiya janaa chahie
 However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has dismissed this petition
