 a Congress MLA troubled by liquor mafia in Madhya Pradesh today created a storm in the politics of Madhya Pradesh
 darasal madhya pradesh main sarkaar congress kii hi he or sharaab mafia se buree tarah pareshaan hokar congress ke hi vidhayak ko apana istipha dene kii naubat aa gai
 Congress legislator Panchilal Meda from Dharampuri in Dhar district sent his written resignation to Chief Minister Kamal Nath, while the ministers of the government ran and Ruthe started persuading the MLA
 vahiin siem kamalnath ne bhi apane vidhayak ko samajhane kii koshish karne lage
 With the offer of this resignation, after 15 years, the Congress government formed in a minority in Madhya Pradesh, came under the cloud of crisis
 meda ne isi patr main sharaab mafia ke khilaaf karrwai na hone ko lekar apni hi party kii sarkaar kii nirankushta par bhi sawaal khadey kar die
 Panchilal expressed his resignation to the Chief Minister expressing grief and said that despite the Congress government, no action is being taken on the liquor mafia
 bataa den ki apane kshetra main sharaab mafia par karrwai nahin hone se panchilal meda dukhi hai
 According to him, the district administration is doing its own arbitrary
 vahi panchilal ne khud kii jaan kaa khatara bhi bataaya or mukhyamantri se milakar is sambandh main charchaa karne kii baat kahi he
 Panchilal says that due to the liquor mafia, the police kept him in the police station for 4 hours
 is ghatnakram se mujhe bahut maansik pidaa hui, jisase mai bahut aahat hua hum
 The entire Kamal Nath government panicked after the Congress legislator offered his resignation in the Lok Sabha election season
 aanan fanan main do cabinet mantri grahamantri bala bachchan or khaadya aapurti mantri pradhyumna singh tomars harakat main aa gaye or ruthe vidhayak ko manaane sidhe vidhayak vishram grih par pahunch gaye
 Before MLA Panchilal opened a few more cards in front of the media, the minister took his hand and left in the car
 is dauraan unhone vidhayak ko media se baat bhi nahin karne di
 After long talks, the ruthless MLA finally convinced Panchilal to attend the program of the Tribal Development Council in Manas Bhavan, after celebrating both the ministers and sat directly with Kamal Nath on the dais
 is dauraan siem kamalnath ne bhi ishaare ishaare main adivasee vidhayak panchilal ko ek kadaa sandesh de diya ki bolnaa siikho
 On the other hand, the Congress MLA Panchilal did not resign
 unki naaraazgi thi, lekin unhen manaa liya he
 But the Congress is convinced that the district administration is not cooperating with them
 vidhayakon kaa maananaa he ki afasar abhi bhi is galatfahami main he ki sarkaar abhi bijepi kii hi he
 However, it is clear that the resentment of the Congress MLA and the offer of resignation has given the BJP a chance to attack against the Congress
 idhar netaa vipaksh gopal bhargav ne ise dukhad bataate hue kaha ki sharaab mafia se pratadit hokar istife kii peshkash vidhayak kare, to andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 80 dinon main sharaab mafia pradesh main kis tarah haaavee ho gaya he
 Now the question is why the resentment of a Congress MLA and then the offer of resignation in a moment caused so much panic
 iske liye madhyapradesh kii satta kaa ganit samajhnaa hoga
 In fact, out of 230, an absolute majority is 216, out of which Kamal Nath government is formed on the strength of 114 Congress mlas and four BSP mlas including two BSP, one Samajwadi Party
 jabaki bijepi ke paas 109 vidhayak hai
 Already, the displeasure of BSP MLA Rambai and Independent MLA Surendra Singh Shera in the Congress government formed in the midst of this manipulation is evident
 baharhaal aise main agar congress kaa ek vidhayak idhar udhar hota he to vaaki congress ke liye mushkilen khadi ho sakati he

 After the announcement of the elections of 5 states, the Aam Aadmi Party is launching the 'AAP' trade wing fund raising program for the municipal elections of Punjab and Goa as well as Delhi
 aaptreda wing ke sanyojak brijesh goyal ke mutabik is fund rejing kaarykram ke liye lagbhag 300 vyapaariyon ke shaamil hone kii ummid he
 However the interesting question is that despite the ban, traders will join this fund raising program? Currently, the AAP Trade Wing has set a target of raising one crore rupees through this fund raising program
 is kaarykram main dilli ke udyog mantri satendra jain, paryaton mantri kapil mishra, party ke rashtriya koshadhyaksh raghav chaddha shaamil honge
 Along with this, all the mlas of the party have also been invited for this event

 congress chhod bijepi main aae chhabil patel ko bijepi ne abdasa seat se tikat diya tha jisaki vajah se bhanushaali kaa patta cat gaya tha
 Political experts believe that Bhanushali did not help during the election to Chhabil Patel, who contested the BJP ticket from Abdasa, but got him cross-polled against him
 is vajah se donon kii dushmani or gahari ho gai
 After this, Bhanushali was accused by Chhabil Patel in the Naliya rape case too
 haalanki is maamle main koi thos saboot na milane kii vajah se police ne kisi bhi tarah kii kaarywahi karne se manaa kar diya tha
 After making videos, blackmail was also repeated after this, the rivalry between the two became deeper

 Not only this, blackmail was also made repeatedly by making videos of it
 haalanki isamen exiaar hone ke baad chhabil patel ne madhyasthata kii jiske baad ladki ne hai court main khud ke jariye lagaae gaye saare aarope waapas le liye

 chhabil patel par kariban 2 maheene pehle hi dilli kii ek mahila ne rape kaa aarope lagaakar exiaar darj karwaai thi jise bhanushaali prerit mana ja rahaa tha
 Because of this, Chhabil was repeatedly threatening to kill Bhanushahi
 vahiin, bhanushaali ke najdiki log maanate hai ki yah badi raajnneetik sajeesh he
 Actually, Bhanushali had been lobbying for a long time to make Union Minister Purushottam Rupala the Chief Minister of Gujarat in Gujarat
 aapasi ranjish he raajnneetik sajishabhanushaali kuch din pehle dilli main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se milane bhi pahunche the jahaan unhone yah kaha tha ki unke paas 40 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he

 He died on the spot
 jayanti bhanushaali par pichley saal ek mahila ne balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha

 Mayawati arrived at the rally site by helicopter and as the waiting occupants for hours saw her helicopter in the sky, they started shouting slogans in welcome and dropping blue balloons in the sky
 party supremeo ke liye vishaal manch par bich bich ek akelaa sopha rakhaa tha
 She came on stage and shook hands and greeted the supporters and sat on the couch

 Were
 kaaphi jaddojahad ke baad yah pataa chalaa ki vah maala to hajaar-hajaar rupee ke noto se banaai gai thi
 After accepting the garland of thousands of rupees notes, the BSP supremo again sat on the couch and Assembly Speaker Sukhdev Rajbhar stood nearby while Nasimuddin, Lalji Verma and many other ministers kept shouting slogans from the platform

 There was also a moment of worry during this, when it was only during Mayawati's address that a flock of bees reached the rally
 haalanki thodi der baad idhar udhar bhatakane ke baad yah jhund vahaan se kahin or chalaa gaya or tab jaakar sabake maathe par chai chintaa khatm ho pai

 The banner-poster series against Narendra Modi in Gujarat is not taking the name of stopping
 beeti raat ahmedabad kii sadakon par phir ek binar najar aayaa

 s
 es ke mohan bhagavat najar aa rahe hai
 Obviously, an attempt has been made to show through the banner that Modi is at the top and the rest is below
 ye binar kisne lagaaya he iskaa pataa nahin chal paaya he
 But ever since Sanjay Joshi has left the BJP, banners and posters have been coming out against Modi and in the cities of Gujarat in support of Joshi
 haalanki, sanjay joshi lagaataar isamen apana haath hone se inkaar karte rahe hai
 Two days ago, he wrote a letter to his supporters and termed the postership as a conspiracy against him
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki iske peeche koun he? ye binar aise vakt main saamne aayaa he jab gujarat ke purv siem keshubhai patel modi kii shikaayat lekar dilli pahunche hue hai
 Obviously, the BJP can climb the mercury mercury with this banner

 At that time it was called the ICC Knockout Trophy
 iske baad se dakshin africa kisi bade toornament main semifinal se aage nahin pahunchaa he
 But on Wednesday, the team led by AB de Villiers would like to wash this stigma
 toornament ke group charan main dakshin africa ko pehle match main bharat ne haraaya

 aakhri match main tej gendbaaj del sten kii team main vaapasi se uskaa gendbaaji akraman majboot hua he
 He took two wickets for 33 against the West Indies
 sten ke alaava dakshin africa ke paas madhyam tej gendbaaj riyaan maclaren bhi he, jisane pakistan ke khilaaf chaar wicket liye the
 Chris Maurice, Lonwabo Sotsobe and spinner Robin Peterson are also doing well
 ballebaaji main hashim amala kaa farm dakshin africa ke liye kaaphi ahm hoga
 He will have to play the role of the pioneer of the innings
 colin ingram ne westeindies ke khilaaf 83 gend main 73 ran banaae
 De Villiers, Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy and David Miller also have the power to change the map of the match on their own
 duusari ore england ne newjiland ko varshabadhit match main das ran se haraakar semifinal main jagah banaai
 England's morale will have increased in front of its domestic audience, which will have a psychological edge over South Africa
 pichley do maichon main 269 or 293 ran banane vaale england ke ballebaaj shandaar farm main lag rahe hai
 The comments england ke shisharkram main captain elestare cook, ian bel, jonathan traat, jo root or ravi bopaara ne ran banaae hai
 If the host team also makes a big score then there will be no surprise

 The Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, while emphasizing on increasing the price of diesel being sold at a price much lower than the cost, said on Thursday that be ready to face the situation like increase in diesel prices or the grid will come to a standstill
 ullekhneey he ki haal main do din lagaataar grid thap hone ke kaaran 20 rajyon main ghanton bijli gaayab rahi

 "if diesel prices are not raised in line with the international market, then we will have to compensate from the budget or our energy sector will continue to remain weak, neither of these is good for inflation
" ' It is noteworthy that recently, electricity was missing for 20 days in 20 states due to grid stagnation for two consecutive days

 kitaab ke anusaar, congress jahaan rahul ko pradhanmantri pad kaa aglaa ummdwaar kehane main nahin hichakati vahiin duusari ore varun gandhi apni hi party main aksar vyavhaarik rup se alag-thalag khadey najar aate hai
 This book has been written about Rahul Gandhi's 'mission 2012' that he hopes that this time he will ensure his party's victory in Uttar Pradesh by adopting Mayawati's social engineering formula
 is formule ne varsh 2009 ke aam chunaavon main congress ko 21 siten dilaai thim jisaki vajah se basapa pramukh ne brahman maton kii keemat par dalit or muslimon ko lubhaane par dhyaan kendrit kar diya
 The book said that after the party's efforts to get a grip in UP, the Congress was expected to decide the candidates for the 2012 assembly elections in 2011, just like the BSP
 haalanki isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bihar main congress ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or uttar pradesh ko mayawati se chhinane ke liye jo kaaryakarta vyapak yojana par kaam kar rahe the ve bhramit ho gaye
 According to the book, the results of the Bihar assembly elections in 2010 revealed that Rahul's formula proved to be harmful for the party

 North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered more nuclear tests using small-sized weapons
 kim kaa daawa he ki ye astr unke vaigyanikon ne viksit kiye hai
 North Korea's official news agency KCNA said that after witnessing the launch of a ballistic missile, they emphasized the importance of conducting 'more nuclear tests to assess the destructive capability of newly built nuclear weapons'
 sarkari media ne buudhvaar ko kim kii tasviren prakashit kii thim, jinamein parmaanu takaneekavidon ke paas gaye kim ko laghu aakaar ke ek parmaanu astr ke paas khadaa dikhaaya gaya tha
 During this visit to South Korea and the US, Kim said that his scientists had mastered the process of reducing the size of weapons and now could also be deployed in a ballistic missile
 yah ek aisa kadam he, jo dakshin korea, kshetra ke anya deshon or antat: america ke mukhya bhubhag ke liye khatra badha degaa
 This exercise is certainly a response to the large-scale military exercises between South Korea and the United States

 After suffering a humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, it seems that the Congress has also lost its spirits
 isi kaa nateeja he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi tamaam maan-manouvval ke baavjood adhyaksh pad se istife ko lekar adig hai
 The Congress has not yet been able to find Rahul's option, while the BJP, led by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has returned to power after winning a big victory
 shah ke kendriya grih mantri banane ke baad bijepi kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ko bana diya gaya he
 In this way, BJP now has two presidents and Congress does not have one
 aise main sawaal he ki itani lachar taiyaari ke saath bijepi kaa muqabla congress kaise karegi?6 maheene tak rahenge rashtriya adhyakshadilli main somvaar ko bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main jepi nadda ko kaaryakari adhyaksh banane kaa faisla liya gaya
 However Amit Shah has not resigned from the post of president
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki amit shah agle 6 maheene tak party ke rashtriya adhyaksh bane rahenge
 Along with Amit Shah, JP Nadda will look after the work of the party
 vidhansabha chunaav tak adhyaksh bane rahane kii maangadrasal bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main amit shah ne kaha ki unke paas kendriya grih mantralay kii bhi jimmedaari he
 Therefore, the post of party president should be given to someone else, as they will be unable to give sufficient time to the party
 isi ke baad jepi nadda ko kaaryakari adhyaksh kii kaman di gai he
 However, the board members urged Amit Shah to continue as president until the BJP membership campaign and the upcoming assembly elections are over
 party netaa bole- rahul nahin to koi or nahinvahin, loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar kii jimmedaari lete hue rahul gandhi ne adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya to party main hangaamaa much gaya
 All senior Congress leaders have persuaded Rahul several times to continue in office and withdraw his resignation, but he is fully upholding his decision
 jabaki party netaa lagaataar yah kah rahe hai ki rahul nahin to koi or nahin
 Who has replaced Rahul, not yet decided, it is going to be about a month since Rahul resigned
 congress ke seedblusi kii kai baithken hone ke baad bhi rahul kii jagah adhyaksh pad ke liye kisi duusare netaa kii talash puri nahin ho saki he
 However, in the meeting of senior Congress leaders, it was proposed to make former Defense Ministers AK Antony and KC Venugopal as the Working President of the party, which was rejected by both these leaders citing personal reasons
 iske alaava adhyaksh ke liye kai naam or bhi media main aae the, lekin kisi par abhi muhar nahin lag saki he
 If not today or tomorrow, Rahul is the president! As a result, after an informal meeting with senior Congress leaders in the past, party spokesman Randeep Surjewala had said that Rahul Gandhi was, and will remain, Congress president
 hamen ise lekar koi andeh nahin he
 This means that Rahul will be the president of the Congress tomorrow, if not today
 philhal congress bina adhyaksh ke chal rahi he

 kya hua us ratnire sanyog se main usitihaas kaa gavaah ban gayajo 15 taarikh ke shuukravaar kii raat istambul main gata
 This was the last night of my small conversation with the family
 maine bosphorus strates par krooj main suryaast dekhne jane kii peshkash kii jisamen raat kaa khaanaa or beli dance dekhnaa shaamil tha
 Luckily they vetoed the idea and we decided to have dinner at a Turkish restaurant, walking distance from the hotel
 sangeetkaaron ke saath ga or naach rahe duusare khaanaa khaane waalon ke saath hamen bhi bhanak tak nahin lagi ki baahar takhtapalat ho rahaa he
 There was chaos in the street when we came out of the restaurant and realized that something was wrong
 hamane logon ko hadabadi main texiyaan bulaate dekha
 TV channels in our hotel were telling that army tanks have blocked the way on important bridges
 apane hotel kii chat se hamane pul ke donon taraf milon tak gadipoon kaa jam dekha
 The hotel staff i spoke to seemed to have been patient with Vesatta's handing over to the army
 unamem ek ne to yaad kiya ki pichley 60 saal main yah paanchvaan takhtapalat hoga
 Returning to political silence, amidst the growing uneasiness, i noticed that the official government channels had increased the shops and private television channels were telling that the perpetrators of the coup had taken over
 tabhi ghoshnaa hui ki marshall lau kaa elaan kar diya gaya he, karfu laga diya gaya he or hidaayat di gai he ki sadakon par na nikalen

 turki ke pradhanmantri binali yildirim kaa ek bayaan aa rahaa tha ki takhtapalat kii koshish naakaam ho jaaegi, magar anisht kii baat yah thi ki 2004 se mulk par hukumat kar rahe dabang sattadhari raashtrapati rajab taiyab erdogaan kii taraf se nipat khamoshi thi
 The pass that overturned in the middle of the night happened around midnight, a surprising incident happened
 ek nijee turki channel ne achaanak aai-phone par erdogaan kaa ek phase time intervyuu dikhaaya, jisamen unhone turki ke logon se aahvaan kiya ki ve sadakon par nikalen or takhtapalat ko naakaam kar den
 After this call, people broke the curfew and started on the streets
 kareeb subah 4
 My eyes opened with a jerk at 30 when the glass windows of the hotel began to rattle at the sound of jets flying below
 kuch duuri par dhamaakon kii awaajen suni ja sakati thim
 i did not see anything when i looked outside
 logon ne badal di kahaneepau fatne par tivi channelon ne gajab kaa najaara dikhaaya, jisamen bosphorus pul par sainik apane tinkon se baahar nikalne kii jaddojahad kar rahe the, unke haath aatmasamarpan kii mudra main uthe hue the jabaki unke chaaron taraf bheed khushi manaa rahi thi
 i was surprised to see this and also relieved

 Similar reports were also coming from the capital Ankara
 saaf tha ki turki kii sabase kaali raat biit chuki thi, magar ek keemat chukaane ke baad hi—265 logon ne apni jaan ganvaai or 2,000 se zyada ghayal hue
 While this development shook the people, one person told me that the mathematics of the coup perpetrators was disturbed — there was no doubt in the minds of the Turkish people that the best way to change the leaders was not the gun, but Ballet is paper

 But suddenly at night, he would become a butcher by tailor
 din main logon ke kapade silne vaala raat ko logon ko kafan pehanaane nikal padataa
 So far he himself has agreed to do 33 murders
 baaki kii ginati jaise-jaise yaad aa rahi he
 Is being told ji haa, bhopal se baahar ai ye khabar desh ke sabase nae serial killer kii he
 Largest Killer: Many new people have been killed and the serial killer of a group of murderers who sleep in death
 ek aisa serial killer jo din main logon ke kapade silata tha or raat ko logon ke kafan taiyaar karata
 Yes, a tailor by profession but actually a serial killer
 ek aisa serial killer jo katl kii 33 tak kii ginati to abhi suna rahaa he
 No one knows where the count will go next
 to aaie miliye desh ke is sabase nae serial killer se
 The name is Aadesh Khamara
 wo madhya pradesh ke bhopal main rahata he
 He is accused of killing 33 people
 katl ke baad phir katl2010 main achaanak uttar bharat ke kai rajyon main trek driveron or clinron ke qatl kii khabaren aati hai
 Unclaimed dead bodies began to be found in MP, UP, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Orissa
 magar qatl kii in sabhi vaardaaton main ek cheez samaan thi
 All those who were murdered were truck drivers or their accomplices
 qatl par katl hue ja rahe the or police ke haath khaali the
 Since cctvs are not installed on most highways, the police could not find any clue of the killer
 aise mila kaatil kaa suraag2010 se shuru hua katl kaa ye silsil agle aath saalon tak jari rahata he
 Corpses continue to be found
 kaatil gaayab rahata he
 But then recently the body of a truck driver is found again in Bilkiria area near Bhopal
 magar is baar laash ke saath-saath police ko kaatil kaa suraag bhi mil jaataa he
 The whole gang-rape behind the serial killing is the first time the police get a suspect from a chance-a-crime
 use pakad kar jab poochtacha hoti he to pataa chalata he ki is serial kiling ke peeche puri ek gang he
 The gang leader is none other than a tailor of Bhopal
 darji aadesh khamaara
 Aadesh owned a small teller shop on the outskirts of Bhopal
 jahaan din main wo silaai mashin par kapade silata or raat ke vakt logon ko kafan pahanaataa
 In 2010, the first slaughtered killer order carried out the first murder incident in 2010
 sabase pehle usne maharashtra ke amravati or phir nasik main driver or clinar kakatlakia
 After this, the process of finding dead bodies started
 maharashtra, uttar pradesh or bihar main bhi kai shav baraamad hue
 The nine arrested, including the tailor, were the masterminds of the tailor-in-serial killing, but many more people were also involved in the incident
 police ab tak aise nau logon ko pakad chuki he
 But as the tailor opens his mouth, the number of corpses increases
 bhopal police ke mutabik aadesh ko pichley hafte uttar pradesh ke sultanpur ke ek jangal se pakadaa gaya tha
 After this, he talked about killing 15, then 25 and then 30 people
 magar phir ek subah khud hi police se kahata he ki teen or katl kii kahani use yaad aa gai he
 After that it takes the count to 33
 police ko mili saare javasub zaahir he police ko ye jaananaa tha ki ek darji serial killer kyon ban gaya? kyon wo sirf tr driver or clinar kii hi jaan letaa tha? wo unhen kis tarah martha tha? or aath saal tak kabhi wo police kii najar main kyon nahin aayaa? to serial killer darji ne katl kii ginati ke saath-saath in saare sawaalon ke jawaab bhi de die
 The murderer used to get salvation, he was narrating the murder story and the police were listening to the shocking story
 kya koi sirf kisi ko moksh dilaane ke liye uskaa katl kar saktaa he
 If you believe the things of the serial killer tailor, then he had only one thought behind each of the 33 slayers and that the life of truck dowers and cleaners is very painful
 bas unhen us takalif se nijaat dilaane ke liye hi wo unka katl kar detaa tha

 selfi kii shaukeen lalita ne apni hansi ke peeche bahut bada gam chhupaati rahi
 Lalitha had recorded an audio in addition to the suicide note before ending her breath
 suicide note main banyaa kiya tha dardpulice ko uske kamare se ekasuicidenot baraamad hua tha
 Which revealed that Lalita was harassed by her husband Rohit
 usne apane suicide note main rohit or uske gharavaalon par pratadna kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Lalitha wrote that Rohit left her in the middle
 rohit ne use or uske parivaar ko bahut rulaayaa or dukh diya
 Tired of this, she is taking these steps
 lalita kii ye duusari shaadi thidisipi vijay kumaar ne bataaya ki rohit indian navy main naukari karata he
 Rohit and Lalita had a love marriage
 lalita kii yah duusari shaadi thi
 Her first marriage was in the year 2012
 lalita ne apane pehle pati ke khilaaf dahej pratadna kaa maamla bhi darj karaayaa tha
 This would have been Lalita's first Karvachauth; if Lalita had been alive, it would have been the first Karvachauth of her life
 lekin chalni se karvaa chouth ke chand kaa didaar karne se pehle uski jindagi ke saare armaan chalni ho gaye
 Lalita cut short her life before praying for her husband's long life
 lekin khudakushi se pehle uskaa dard, uski chitkaar sunne waalon ke kaleje ko chalni kar rahi he
 According to the police, Lalita has accused the in-laws of making mental and physical torture for dowry
 bataaya jaataa he ki lalita depressant main thi, kyonki uski pehali shaadi bhi dahej kii vajah se tuuti thi
 Perhaps she feared that her marriage to Rohit might not be broken
 lalita ne rohit se beintehaa pyaar kiya tha, or wo kisi bhi keemat par use khona nahin chaahati thi
 When she was recording her audio for the last time, she was saying the same thing, don't say anything to Rohit

 Sacred Games, a web series based on the novel by Vikram Chandra, has become a super hit on the Internet
 navazuddin siddiki isamen villen kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai or saf ali khan ek police officer ke role main hai
 The first season has made a place in the minds of the people, now it remains to be seen what the special season brings for the viewers
 khabar he ki duusare sijan main actor pankaj treepathi ahm bhoomika nibhaate najar aa sakate hai
 Sacred Games: AICWA also complained after abusing the former PM
 DNA in one of its reports quoted sources as saying, "makers have already planned the second season
 isaki shooting mumbai main november se shuru kar di jaaegi
 Pankaj Tripathi, who plays Guruji in the first season, will be seen in the central role alongside Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the second season
 pehle sijan main sirf unka wois over or unke teen seen hi dikhaai die the lekin kyonki vah mastermind hai to agle sijan main unhen mukhyata se dikhaaya jayega
 Sacred Games: The central government is also eyeing, angry with this scene, on the one hand the viewers are enjoying this webseries on the other hand, on the other hand it seems to be getting entangled in controversies too

 The Modi government has made clear its intention to train the youth professionally by creating a separate skill development ministry and has taken forward the plans of the previous government in this regard
 lekin yah sarkaar aisa kya alag karegi, jisase use manmohan sarkaar kii tarah maamuli kamyaabi se santosh na karnaa pade? kaushal vikaas mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata santosh kumaar or piyush babele se isaki baarikiyon kaa khulaasa kiya
 Excerpts: The slogan of skill development is old, what are you doing new in it? In December 2013, the first National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) was formulated
 ab desh main har tarah kii training enescuef ke tahat hogi
 By 2016, all government aided institutes will have to join this framework and by 2019, NSQF certificates will also be necessary for government jobs
 is tarah se ham desh main peshewar training ke ve maanak lagu kar paaenge, jo viksit deshon main chal rahe hai
 But with this intention, the skill development policy of the UPA government in 2009 has derailed
 2009 kii niti main 50 karod yuvaaon ko prashikshit karne kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha
 Of these, 50 million people were to be trained between 2009 and 2012 and 45 crore people between 2012 and 2017, these targets could not be met
 isiilie to doordarshee pradhanmantri narendra modi ne skill deveopment ke liye november 2014 main alag mantralay banaaya or is saal nai rashtriya kaushal vikaas niti bhi laai ja rahi he
 What exactly will NSQF be like? There will be levels from one to 10
 jaise level ek or do kaa certificate welder yaa fitre ke liye hoga to label 3 or 4 kaa certificate suparvizer ke liye hoga
 Similarly, the label 9 and 10 will have a certificate for posts like MD
 yani logon ke paas ek aisa certificate hoga jo udyogon ko batayega ki unke paas kis kaam kaa hunar he
 How will these certificates be different from itis or school certificates? Now the training share has to be increased with theory like 700 hours of theory and 300 hours of training will be necessary in 9th grade
 10veen main yahi anupaat 600:400, 11veen main 500:500 or 12veen main 400-600 ho jayega
 That is, the training part will increase with class
 bacchon ko dasvin ke certificate ke saath enescuef kaa level certificate milegaa
 This certificate will help him to get a job immediately
 lekin itani badi aabaadi ko trend karne ke liye trainer kahaan se aaenge or paisa kahaan se aayega?paanch saal main 25 karod yuvaaon ko trend karne ke liye 5 lakh karod ru
 Investment required
 yah badi rakam he
 But if you look at the 24 Ministries of the Central Government itself, 70,000 crores at this time
 kii skill deveopment yojanaayen chalaa rahe hai
 Once you start walking, more paths will come out
 nai niti main kya vijan lekar aa rahe hai?is bare main modi ji ke paas vichaaron kaa bhandar he

 Deadline 17 July 2017 1993 ke mumbai bam dhamaakon ke doshi yaqub memon ko jald faansee di ja sakati he
 Let us know who is Jacob Memon
 
 
 yaqub memon kaa puraa naam yaqub abdul rajjak memon he
 Yakub was born on 30 July 1962 in Mumbai
 vah peshey se chartered acountint tha
 Yakub is the most educated man in the Memon family and has been in jail ever since the Nepal Police arrested him from Kathmandu and handed over to the Indian agency CBI
 vah ek acount se judi form chalaa rahaa tha,jiske jariye vah apane bhai tiger memon ke gaiyr-kanoonee finance sambhalata tha
 Memon is pursuing a Masters in Political Science from Indira Gandhi Open University
 pichley saal yaqub memon ne eme kii second year kii pariksha di he
 Yakub earned a post graduation degree in English from IGNOU in 2013
 faansee kii sajaa sunaae jane ke baad se vah nagpur central jail main band he
 The hanging was upheld by the Supreme Court, rejecting Yakub Memon's reconsideration petition
 pichley saal raashtrapati bhi yaqub kii dayaa yachika khaarij kar chuke hai
 Memon's lawyers demanded that the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment
 yaqub ke vakeelon kii daleel thi ki vah sirf dhamaakon kii sajeesh main shaamil tha na ki dhamaakon ko anjaam dene main
 According to the court, Yakub Memon, Tiger Memon and Dawood Ibrahim were the main conspirators of the Mumbai blasts
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav (kesiar) ke istife or vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kii manjuuri ke baad abodishane bhi jald chunaav karaane kii maang kii he
 It is believed that on the lines of KCR, the Chief Minister, Patnaik is also going to resign and play the election bet
 bataa den ki is saal ke aakhir main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan or mizoram ke vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Along with these four states, the possibility of assembly elections in Telangana has increased
 iske saath odisha main bhi chunaav ke asaar najar aane lage hai
 The Law Commission had said in its draft report that elections to the Kilok Sabha and the state assemblies should be held simultaneously, but for this the state must agree to the elections
 vidhi ayog ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to aam chunaav nirdhaarit samay se pehle hone kii sambhaavna dikhne lagi he
 After the dissolution of the Telangana Assembly, the Election Commission is going to meet today to explore the possibility of elections
 vidhansabha bhang hote hi ayog kii koshish he ki rajasthan, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh or mizoram ke saath telugana vidhansabha kaa bhi chunaav kara diya jaae
 However, after the formation of Telangana, assembly elections were held in 2014 along with the Lok Sabha elections
 is tarah se dekha jaae to abhi 8 maheene kaa kaarykaal bachaa tha or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke saath telugana ke chunaav hote hai
 BJD MP Pinaki Mishra met the Election Commission in Delhi and said that if the decision is taken to conduct the 2019 Lok Sabha elections ahead of time, then the Assembly elections of Odisha should be held simultaneously
 mishra ne kaha ki bijepi loksabhaa or 11 rajya sabhaaon ke saath-saath chunaav karaane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 In such a situation, Odisha should also be included in one country one election
 unhone kaha ki alag-alag chunaavon ke liye rajya sarkaar ko 1000 karod rupee kharch honge, jo odisha jaise vikasshil rajya par kharch nahin kar sakate hai, jabaki ek saath chunaav ke kharch centre or rajya sarkaar donon dwaara saajha kiya jaataa he
 Now after the latest developments, the Commission will discuss whether elections should be held in November in four states as well as in Telangana
 ayog kii aaj hone vaale is baithak main anya muddon ke saath saath telugana main raajnneetik sthiti or november main rajya ke saamaajik saanskrithik ghatnakram yaa parv tyohaar ko lekar bhi charchaa hogi
 Although this will be a very early discussion, but it will open the doors of possibilities
 telugana ke baad odisha main bhi chunaav ke asaar dikhne lage hai
 Naveen Patnaik has previously supported one country and one election
 pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi baar-baar loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaav saath-saath karaane par jor dete rahe hai
 He reiterated the same while addressing the Chief Ministers at the Niti Aayog meeting
 dilachasp baat ye he ki odisha ke mukhya chunaav adhikari surendra kumaar ne june ke maheene main hi sabhi jila collectoron ko likhit aadesh jari karte hue sambhavit chunavi kharch par report maangi thi
 It was also said to report to the Election Commission on necessary management in elections so that their requirements can be met
 haalanki surendra kumaar ne aam chunaav 2019 main hi chunaav kii baat kahi thi or yah bhi kaha tha ki taiyaariyaan samay par puri hon isliye thodaa jaldi report dene ko kaha gaya he
 But political parties consider it a sign of holding elections ahead of time
 darasal kaarykaal puraa hone se pehle vidhansabha bhang kara die jane ke daanv se chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke liye vipakshi dalon ko zyada mauka na mil paaegaa
 Be it KCR or Naveen Patnaik, the opposition does not have any leader equal to them in the stature of these two leaders
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vidhansabha chunaav karaae jane se unhen khaasi mehnat nahin kerani padegi or apni chhavi kaa rajyastareey chunaav main phayda uthaa sakenge
 In such a situation, if we stop till April, then in the general election environment, the factor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi can dominate
 congress vahaan par mukhya vipakshi dal he or party rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar detii he to loksabhaa voting ke dauraan vidhansabha voting par iskaa asar pad saktaa he
 This is the reason that the Chief Ministers of Odisha and Telangana are betting on elections soon
 gaurav yatra par nikalinrajasthandi mukhyamantrivasundhararaaje kohaicortse tagada jhatka laga he
 The Rajasthan High Court today said that government expenditure should not be incurred on the Gaurav Yatra
 gaurav yatra ke dauraan chalane vaale vaahanon main mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko chhodkar mantriyon adhikariyon par sarkari paise kharch nahin honge

 While hearing the petition of the Congress, the Rajasthan High Court had issued notice to the BJP and to the Rajasthan government, in response to which the Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan said that the BJP is a mixed journey of the state government
 rajasthan main jis party kii sarkaar he us party ke kaaryakarta sammelnon main aaenge hi or saath hi sarkaar apni yojana kaa laabh liye logon se samvaad kar rahi he to vah bhi aaenge
 Hearing on this, the decision was reserved by the Rajasthan High Court

 Where do we go now " Demonetization has been completed 50 days
 500 or 1000 rupee kii puraani karency ko jamaa karaane kaa aaj aakhri din bhi he
 In the direction of moving the country towards cashless system for the last 50 days among them, statistics are saying that the use of credit card and debit card from Point of Sale (POS) machine in November registered a 31% fall in the total amount paid happened
 aisa bhi tab he jab notebandi ke 50 dinon tak desh main card tranjaction par lagane vaale sabhi charge hataa liye gaye the
 Today is also the last day of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's time to overcome the problems of common man in 50 days
 iske baavjood bainkon or atm ke baahar lagi lambii qatari abhi khatm hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 Based on the internal review of the Reserve Bank, it is being said that banks across the country have spoken of not getting enough currency from the central bank
 november ke aankadestate bank of india ke research aankadon ke mutabik navbanr main debit card or credit card kaa istemaal kar pement kii gai kul rakam main 31 fisadi kii giravat darj hui he
 Due to this decline, direct purchase at these point of sale terminals has been just Rs 35,240 crore
 point of cell par kharidari main yah giravat na maheene ke nichle str par pahunch gai he
 Significantly, in February 2016, the total purchase on POS was Rs 33,600 crore
 nae aankadon ke mutabik 13 disambar 2016 tak bhi pioes par kharadaari kamjor rahi or in 13 dinon main mahaj 18,130 karod rupee kii kharidari kii gai
 At the same time, per capita shopping on the pattern of decline in total purchases on POS in November fell from Rs 2,229 in October to Rs 1,714
 oktober ke aankaderiurb bank ke oktober ke aankade kehete hai ki desh main kul 94
 There were 2 crore cards

 Has done a total transaction of 63 lakh crores
 haalanki isamen lagbhag 92 fisadi debit card kaa istemaal atm se cash nikaalane ke liye kiya gaya
 Only 8 per cent of the cards were used to make purchases directly at the point of sale terminal
 oktober maheene main pioes par kul kharidari 51,116 karod rupee kii hui thi
 August figures: The Reserve Bank's August figures say a total of 71 in the country

 These debit cards total 75
 67 karod baar atm card par istemaal kiye gaye
 At the same time, with these debit cards, 13 crore transactions were done to make a point of sale

 However, the Reserve Bank has not yet released the actual data on cash withdrawals from atms for November and December
 india today ke sampadak aarthik maamalon ke export anshuman tiwari kaa maananaa he ki janvari ke pehle hafte tak aane vaale in aankadon se saaf ho jayega ki debit card or credit card se cash nikaalane ke aankade kai guna zyada darj hue hai
 According to Anshuman Tiwari, during the demonetisation in November, mobile payments have seen an increase of about 10%
 haalanki isaki tulana pioes par hue tranjaction main 31 fisadi giravat se nahin kii ja sakati
 According to him, this increase in mobile payments clearly means that some people have resorted to mobile payments due to lack of cash, while most people still have confidence in cash, so they put more emphasis on ATM withdrawal with the help of credit and debit cards

 kamjor or bikhare vipaksh tathaa sharad pavaar jaise majboot sahyogi ke saath ke chalate barkaraar rahi sonia gandhi kii apni chamak
 Sonia Gandhi established the Congress as a natural party to power over the debris of Indian right wing
 ab unhen ek majboot neenv kii jarurat he
 Sonia's aura is maintained "sound science also seems to be in favor of Sonia Gandhi's politics
 kya yah koi ufaan he? yaa unka uthaan, jo gathbandhan kii chal-kapat bhari raajnneeti ke gurutvkarshan dabaav ko bhi beasar kar rahaa he? yaa yah feeki na padati chamak kaa karishma he? maharashtra main hattric, haryana main maamuli antar se jeet or arunachal main baari safalataa ke baavjood sonia ufaan yaa uthaan main nahin bahatin, balki fossil banane ke kagaar par pahunche vipakshi netaaon se pate rajnatik paridrishy main unki chamak barkaraar he
 After winning the last two general elections, his aura to become the head of India's oldest party remains
 yah ek kushal ranneetik kii jeet he or aise netaa kii bhi, jo apane prabhaav kshetra kii simaaen bakhubi jaanata he or rajnatik saajhedaari kii kadra bhi karata he
 They have kept pace
 zyada yathartwaadee nikaleen soniamaharashtra main agar ve fantasiyon ke pher main pad jaatin to bade aaraam se chunaav haar sakati thim
 She could follow the policy of 'ekla Chalo Re', leaving her important partner at the center and NCP leader Sharad Pawar
 apane bete se sabak lekar ve akele hi chunaav maidan main utarane kaa vikalp chun sakati thim lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 She turned out to be more realistic, realizing the importance of transactions in a coalition government because she understood the simple truth that a veteran like Pawar would be better off walking with them than turning them into enemies or rivals
 unke maargdarshan main congress ne chunavi raah nahin apanaai jo bihar or uttar pradesh main apanaai thi
 He checked — though he cannot be called absolutely reliable — decided to remain with the aide
 yah sonia, pavaar or mukhyamantri ashok chavaan kii hi tikdi thi, jisane maharashtra main jeet kii ibaarat likhi
 All three were confident in the strength of the alliance
 or dekhie ki yah kis tarah kargar rahaa
 Despite the huge lack of options in Indian democracy, the Congress did not have to work very hard to repeat the victory in the three states
 haryana main isaki jeet bhale hi maamuli antar se rahi ho, yah bhartiya loktantr main badhate shunya ko darshaati he- vikalp kii baari kami ko
 The scattered and unorganized opposition is losing its place as well and is not in a position to make any argument
 dakshin kheme main kahani khud se haare netritv ke rog kii kahani he
 After Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who retired from politics due to his age, the BJP does not have a leader who can inspire inspiration among the workers, keep allies tied up and get their arguments done
 party ke tathakthith sabase kaddavar netaa laalkrishna adwani apni nirarthakta ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 He is a symbol of the idea of becoming a fossil, which had once tilted the Indian public
 yadi vaajapeyi ke haath main netritv hota to maharashtra or haryana kii kahani kuch or hi hoti
 Had there been a well-known leader in the saffron camp, Shiv Sena's family feuds would not have become so suicidal in political terms
 ab yah ghar jal rahaa he
 In Haryana too, there was no leader in the BJP who would have retained Om Prakash Chautala as an election partner
 sonia kii chamak bane rahane ke baavjood congresavad kaa virodh khatm nahin hua he
 Even now regional brands like Mayawati, Nitish Kumar and Mulayam Singh Yadav are present in Hindi speaking states
 bhartiya raajnneeti main agar kuch kami he to aise netaa kii, jo congress virdohi chhitaki takaton ko ekajute kar sake
 The results of Maharashtra and Haryana replace this truth
 vipaksh ne rashtravaadi netaaon ko bhale hi khaarij kar diya ho lekin sachaai yah he ki uske paas ek bhi rashtriya netaa nahin he
 Sonia has made good use of her opponents Sonia Gandhi has made the best use of her most bitter opponents
 ve gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke dharm kaa bakhubi nirvahan karne vaali netaa banati ja rahi hai, vah bhi hindibhashi rajyon main akele chalane ke rahul gandhi ke ekala chalo prayogon ke baavjood
 The new Mrs Gandhi encourages regional strong leadership - Ashok Chavan in Maharashtra and Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Haryana
 yani aise netaa ko jo party ko jeet bhi dilaate hai or yogya prashaasak bhi hai
 Not only this, they are continuously succeeding in dividing the traditional anti-congress votes or capitalizing them in their interest in the name of secularism
 yahi vajah he ki unhen mayawati yaa mulaayam singh yadav se dar nahin he
 They both have no love for the Congress, but they certainly appreciate their definition of secularism
 or aise bharat main jahaan asantosh kii abhivyakti karkash or karnakatu suron main hoti ho, sonia-jaisaaki unke ek yuva saansad kehete hai- ki shaleenta barkaraar he
 Congress got the benefit of the fragmented opposition of the country, have we come in the era of the never losing Sonia? She is winning, but she has not registered any big wins
 maharashtra yaa haryana main loksabhaa jaisi jeet ve nahin doharaa pai hai
 The Congress is not in power in any major state except Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan or Delhi
 bharat kii sarvaadhik safal or shaktishaalee netaa ko abhi bharat kaa abaadh janadesh milanaa baaki he
 Through the wreckage of Indian right, he has re-established the Congress as the natural party governing India
 sonia gandhi ko congress ke moulik swaroop ko lautaane ke liye or adhik majboot neenv kii jarurat haih yah vah vishaal vat vriksh bane jo har rang kii rashtriya or kshetreey apekshaaon ko poshit karata he
 Sonia needs more than what the country's fragmented opposition can gift her

 In this audio, Masood Azhar also named Adil Ahmed Dar
 bataa den ki adil ne hi pulavama main aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya tha or apni gaadi lekar siarpief ke kafile main ja ghusaa tha
 Masood Azhar said in the audio, "give me as much abuse as you can, but don't say anything against Adil Ahmed, the freedom struggle in Kashmir has been on its feet
" vahaan kisi videshi takat kii jarurat nahin he
 "he also denied having any connection with Adil in this audio, he said that the whole world is connecting Adil with me
" lekin meri hasarat he ki kaash, main usase kabhi mila hota
 If i am killed because of Adil, then there will be no sorrow, it will be martyrdom for me
 apane is audio main masood ajahar ne pakistani colomist ayaaz kii bhi tarif kii, jisane adil ahamed daar kii khule taur par tarif kii thi
 He appealed that the Pakistani people should not come under the pressure of Hindustan
 bataa den ki america, france, rus jaise kai desh jaish-e-mohammad ke pramukh masood ajahar par bain lagane ke liye bharat kii muhim main saath aa gaye hai, jiske baad se hi jaish baukhala gaya he
 Let us tell you that 40 soldiers were martyred in the terrorist attack on 14 February, which was first claimed by jaish-e-mohammad
 lekin ab vah mukarta dikh rahaa he
 Since the incident, Pakistan's thud is happening all over the world, after which Imran Khan had to come for cleaning
 pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne apane bayaan main kaha ki agar koi saboot hai to vah karrwai karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Significantly, jaish-e-mohammed's master Masood Azhar has been keeping Pakistan as his base for the last several years

 On May 20, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tweeted and invited India's nominated Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Tokyo, the twitter came to know an interesting point
 modi un teen vyaktiyon main se ek hai jinhen abe twitor par follow karte hai
 This is an interesting beginning that can turn into the most attractive relationship between the heads of two Asian countries
 modi ne bhi twit kar is nyote ke prati kritagyata vyakt kii
 After this, the Prime Minister of Japan also got a call and he talked to Modi for 15 minutes
 adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki sawaal ab kya kaa nahin balki bas itnaa hi he ki modi apni pehali videshi yatra ke rup main tokyo kab ja rahe hai
 Officials at the Japanese embassy in New Delhi say they want Modi's official visit to be 'as soon as possible'
 samrik or vaishvik saajhedaari ke tahat 2006 se hi har saal bharat or japan ke pradhanmantriyon ke bich sammelan hota he
 Abe was the chief guest of the Republic Day celebrations this year
 modi yadi tokyo jate hai to yah abe se unki teesri mulaakaat hogi
 As Chief Minister of Gujarat, he arrived in Delhi to meet Abe in 2007, when the Prime Minister of Japan came on an official visit to India
 iske baad july, 2012 main japan ke paanch divasiy daure par gaye modi ne phir abe se mulaakaat kii thi
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat was welcomed by the Japanese government like any Head of State
 donon netaaon ne bharat-japan ke behatar rishton ke liye apni drushti ko saajha kiya tha
 Journalist-writer and former press adviser to Manmohan Singh, Sanjay Baru said, "modi also has a passionate association with Japan
" yahaan unke adarsh swami vivekanand ne 1893 main yatra kii thi
 "modi's meeting with Abe is one of the rare instances in which an Indian Chief Minister has established an intimacy with a foreign head of state
 donon dakshinpanthi rashtravaadi hai jo chunaavon main baari jeet ke saath satta main aae hai, lekin iske alaava bhi donon main kai chijen ek jaisi hai
 Both are promoting their distinctive brand of market economy for the revival of the nation
 nai dilli sthit centre for policy research ke brahmï chelani modi ko 'bharat kaa abe’ kehete hai
 According to him, "modi really wants Abe's policy such as soft nationalism, market-oriented economy and new Asianism, so that strategic partnerships can be formed through deep ties in Asian democratic countries
" ”donon deshon ke bich saajhedaari manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri rahane ke dauraan hi shuru ho chuki he
 There is a good bilateral trade of $ 18 billion between India and Japan every year
 modi ne ise or badhaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Modi had tweeted to Abe and said, "I am confident that we will take india-japan relationship to new heights
" ”japan philhal bharat main chauthaa sabase bada niveshak he or 2000 se ab tak yahaan 14 arab dollar se zyada kaa nivesh hua he
 There are indications that the new government will seek the cooperation of the Abe government in the development of the northeastern region of India
 purvottar kaa vikaas modi ke agenda kii pramukh visheshta he
 Similarly, the government will also seek to expedite Japan's cooperation in construction of the multi-purpose ahmedabad-delhi high-speed rail corridor and the delhi-mumbai industrial corridor
 japan main apane vaktavy main modi ne kaha tha ki bharat ke menuphaccharing sector kii kshamta ko sudhaarney or smart shaharon ke nirmaan ke liye pratispardhaatmakataa ko badhaane main mejabaan desh kii ahm bhoomika ho sakati he
 Japanese businessmen hope Modi can make India as competitive as China as an investment destination for Japanese companies
 bharat main japan ke purv rajdoot or ab sujuki motor korporation main diarector saqutaro tanino kehete hai, ''mujhe ummid he ki congress sarkaar ke vipareet vah aisi khule daravaaje vaali niti taiyaar karenge jisamen babushahi, lalaphitaashahee or niyantran kam hoga
 "another Japanese diplomat working in New Delhi says that two things are very important to strengthen the economic relationship
 pehla, bharat-japan samrik gathbandhan ko majboot kiya jaae or doosraa, bharat main jo nitiyaan banaai jaaen, ve sthir or anumaan lagane laayak hon
 He says, "recent regulatory problems have disrupted the flow of Japanese investment into India
" hamen lagata he ki ab vaataavaran ko thik karne ke liye bhartiya netritv kii taraf se ek majboot sanket jayega
 "modi is the first Indian Chief Minister who advocates the Look East Policy
 gujarat main apane 12 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan unhone china, singapore or japan jaisi aarthik takaton ke yahaan se nivesh laane kaa prayaas kiya
 Japanese companies are expected to invest more than $ 2 billion in Gujarat by 2015-16
 2013 ke 'wibrant gujarat’ sammelan main 100 se zyada japani companiyaan shariq hui thim
 Modi's policy of looking east for investment may also be due to the fact that in 2005, the US had imposed a humiliating ban on his visit
 america ne iske liye 2002 ke gujarat dangon main maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kaa hawala diya tha (un par america vija milane par lagi roak ab bhi kaayam he)
 But on May 16, US President Barack Obama called and congratulated him for a landslide victory and invited him to Washington
 chelani kehete hai ki modi ke shashan main bharat-america rishte garmjoshi kii jagah kaarobaari jaise honge
 When Abe tweeted his invitation on 20 May, a think tank of the Chinese government praised Modi, saying he was 'nixon of India' and not 'abe of India'
 shanghai institute of international studies ke liu jogkyi ne communist party ke akhbaar global times main likhaa, ''modi ke utane joardaar tareeke se kaam karne kii sambhaavna nahin he jaisaa ki abe ne kiya tha kyonki isse bhartiya arthvyavastha ko laabh nahin hoga
 “it is clear that Abe of India will have to strike a delicate balance between enemy-friends China and Japan

 The police is closely investigating all aspects
 police ko sabase badi chintaa yah sata rahi he ki kahin ye dilli main kisi nae gangvaar kii aahat to nahin he? Following the controversial statements of Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, now the voice of protest against him in his own party Janata Dal (united) has started emerging
 CM maanjhi bole- videshi hai savarna jati ke logaediu ke ek vidhayak ne to maanjhi ko 'mukhyamantri banane laayak nahin' tak bataa diya
 Party MLA Anant Singh on Thursday targeted Manjhi, saying, 'manjhi's mind balance is not right, he should go to Kanke and get treatment
 janata unke achche bhaashan sunne ke liye taras gai
 'mokama region MLA Anant Singh did not stop here, he said that Manjhi is not fit to become Chief Minister even for a day
 idhar, jediu ke varisht netaa sanjay jha ne bhi maanjhi ke betuke bayanon par tikhi pratikriya vyakt kii he
 They have demanded action on Manjhi for the statement that the upper castes are 'foreign'
 unhone maanjhi ke aise bayaan ko samaaj ko baantne vaala bataaya
 It is worth mentioning that in the past too, the Chief Minister has been the target of the opposition due to his controversial statements
 taaja maamla mukhyamantri ke pashchim champaran daure kaa he, jab unhone savarna jatiyon ko videshi bataaya
 He said during a function that the natives of this place are tribal, scheduled caste and poor people
 savarna jatiyon ke log to baahar se aae hai, isliye ve videshi hai
 This statement of Manjhi has brought the politics of Bihar to a boil
 vipakshi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne kaha ki is bayaan ke liye mukhyamantri ko logon se maafee maangani chahie

 com / p4fzulxrtb Is the opposite atmosphere being created in the whole country against the government of double engine? Are BJP mlas and mps angry with BJP government? It may be difficult to believe, but it is not we who are making the statement of BJP MLA and MP themselves that everything is not going well in BJP
 kyunki ek taraf jahaan uttarakhand main bijepi vidhayak ne morcha khol diya he to vahiin duusari ore paudi saansad bhi ishaaron main bahut kuch kah gaye hai
 Is this spark going to turn into a huge fire? Harbhajan Singh Cheema, who was elected MLA from Kashipur assembly seat in Udhamsinghnagar for 4 consecutive times, has started anti-incumbency against his government, the Modi government has started The state where BJP won 57 seats with tremendous public opinion, but is unable to pay for development
 jiske liye baqayada uttarakhand kii janata ne bijepi ko baari bahumat se sarkaar banane ke liye janadesh diya tha
 "the BJP MLA has clearly accused the state and central government that governments are not being successful in fulfilling the expectation of the general public, due to which a negative atmosphere has been created for the BJP across the country
 cheema kii maane to puure deshbhar main hawa behad kharaab ban rahi he jo aane vaale vakt main party ko nuksaan jarur pahunchaayegi
 Not only Cheema but this pain is also evident in the talk of Pauri MP and former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand General Bhuvan Chand Khanduri
 apni eemaandaar chhavi ke liye logon main paith banane vaale general ne kaha he ki sirf mere dwaara banaaya gaya lokayukta bill hi he jise baqayada tatkaaleen raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne hastakshar kar paas kiya tha magar ham use lagu nahin kar paae, is baat ko lekar ksht vyakt karte hue unhone kaha he ki ab to 57 vidhayak hai hamaare paas , par abhi tak ye bill paas nahin hua he , general kii maane to uttarakhand kii janata bhi is bill kaa intjaar kar rahi he, yahi wo bill he jiske paas hone ke baad vidhayak, mantri or khud mukhyamantri bhi iske daayre main hoga
 It would have proved to be a very important and important step to eliminate corruption even if it were implemented accurately
 magar abhi tak isko thande baste main hi daal rakhaa he
 It is the same to say of General Khanduri, but even the General himself does not know about when and how this will happen because Khanduri, which was once considered essential for BJP, is probably not necessary for the same BJP
 jinaki vajah se kabhi uttarakhand main bijepi kii naiyya paar lagi thi
 On the question of Isnarajagi and anti-incumbency, former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat also did not miss an opportunity and directly put the central government in the dock for this resentment, "if only such senior BJP General General Khanduri does not appear happy Then the mla's displeasure is very small
 "dilli tak faili is naaraazgi ke liye unhone safataur par dabl ingine kii hi sarkaar ko doshi maanate hue kaha ki ab to centre main bhi sarkaar or rajya main bhi to phir kyon nahin lagu kar dete general khanduri kaa lokayukta bill
 After this, those who get prison bars will go there and those who will be innocent will be among the public with a clear image
 harish rawatye kehane se bhi nahin chuke ki kyon naa hai court kii dabl bench laayi jaae or soup die jaaen usko sabhi bhrashtachar ke maamle, phir jisane jo kiya he wo bhugte
 So that the person who has a place can get it, whether he is in jail or freedom
 ye un logon ke liye bhi acha hoga jo sahi myne main paak saaf hai
 In a gesture, Harish Rawat also said to some big leaders who have gone from Congress to BJP, that even those who have gone from here to there will be disappointed
