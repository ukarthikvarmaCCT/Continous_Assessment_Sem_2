sambhawatah in karkon ko shaamil karnaa chahie tha or shaayad nahin bhi
 Why was this exercise done? To ensure that citizens of the entire country can get public goods and services of equal quality
 aise maamle main, agar aise rajya hon jinaki aabaadi kaa bada hissaa aise gaanvon main rahata ho jinaki jansankhya 500 se kam ho or vahaan pahari or durgam ilaake bhi hon, to vastuon or sevaaon kii aapurti laagat kaaphi oonchi hoti he
 Shouldn't this also have been a criterion? Conversely, can SC / ST classification be an indicator of backwardness? There has been many research about the SC population, which shows that if you have control over other factors, having SC is not going to keep anyone away from the benefits of birth
 kya mahila sakshartaa dar yaa mahila kaary bhagidaari dar ko maandand bananaa chahie tha? prati vyakti masik khapat vyay ko aay kaa ek vaikalpik sanketak mana gaya
 Should it have been adopted or any of its specific factors, such as private consumption expenditure on non-food items or expenditure on education and health? What about the use of LPG? Talking about connectivity, the paved road is considered a very good indicator
 vittiya samavesh main bainkon ko hi kyon shaamil kiya jaataa he? post offis ko kyon nahin? pulicekarmiyon kii sankhya ke bare main kya kahenge?main yah suzav nahin de rahaa ki inamen se kisi ek yaa duusare kaarak ko shaamil karnaa chahie tha, yaa samiti ne karkon ke jo samooh sweekaar kiye hai, unhen khaarij kar dena chahie
 i am raising the point that there should have been some discussion on including or rejecting these factors
 samiti ne kya apane is chunaav ke liye koi auchity sabit kiya he? ji nahin
 Let us consider another point
 vikaas kaa matlab baduya hota he
 For other indicators, you can either see growth or its overall value
 udhaaharan ke liye bataaun, to main navjaat shishu mrityu dar par vichaar kar saktaa hum, yaa main navjaat shishu mrityu dar main sudhaar par najar daal saktaa hum
 Depending on which option i choose from these two, the ranking will vary
 ji haa, inkrement ke anusaar sudhaar aakhirkaar base par asar daalata he
 But should i compare increment to increment or increment to base? i want to say that in such an exercise important decisions have to be taken, so one must be very alert

 But the percentage of SC / ST does not change in this way
 kuch rajyon main essi / asti kii jansankhya main tehraav dekha ja saktaa he
 Now consider the source of data
 shiksha kaa udhaaharan lete hai
 In this case, the data is collected from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
 masalaa yah he ki bade paimaane par eneseso ke sample survey aamtaur par har paanch saal par hote hai
 Can any base be decided on the basis of such data which will be available after five years? The committee could have used the best data received every year from the district information system on education for school education
 iske alaava kai anya karkon ke bare main aankade janaganana se liye jate hai
 This means that the next figures will be available only after ten years
 jis chayan ne mujhe vastav main hairaan kiya he, vah he navjaat shishu mrityu dar (iemr), jo swasthya kaa ekmaatr sanketak he
 This surprised me because the last health survey was done in 2005-06
 main aankadon ke strot par najar daalata hum to usamen likhaa dikhataa he, ‘‘sample registration system bulatin, aktubar, 2012
 '' Okay
 esares bulatin main rajyon ke iemr aankade hote hai
 But these are just estimates
 ise anumaan ke liye hi istemaal karnaa behatar he
 According to academic rigor, the need was clearly stated that these are only estimates, not actual data based on the survey
 mujhe to report main iskaa kahin ullekh nahin mila
 What about normalization? Either way, it is clear that generalization of population is essentially superior to normalization of geographic area
 wates yani bhaarank kii baat karen to pisie (principal componant analysis) behatar he kyonki vatting system abhyaas se taiyaar hota he

 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday while presenting the budget for the year 2019-20 when in case of income tax on the interest of taking home loan 1
 5 lakh rupee kii atirikt raahat dene kii baat kii, to bahut se logon ke chehre khil gaye
 Indeed, this additional relief is very good news in terms of tax, but there are many kinds of confusion about which you should overcome
 kya hua he praavdhansbase pehle to yah jaan len ki vitt mantri ne home lone par atirikt tex chhot dene kaa kya praavdhaan kiya he
 In fact till now, there is a facility to save tax on the repayment of both the principal amount and interest of the home loan
 inakam tex act ke section 80C ke tahat home lone ke principal amount par salanaa 1
 Deduction facility up to 5 lakh rupees is available, that is, you can deduct this amount from your taxable income
 isi tarah inakam tex kii dhara 24 bi ke tahat home lone ke byaaj par saalaan 2 lakh rupee tak kii rakam par tex chhot milti he
 Now the Finance Minister said that 1 on a house up to Rs 45 lakh under a separate section 80EEA
 5 lakh rupee kii atirikt chhot home lone ke byaaj adaayagi par milegi
 In this way now you 3 in year 5 lakh rupee tak ke chukaaye hue home lone byaaj ke badale tex chhot hasil kar sakate hai
 What's new in this provision Expert Balwant Jain said, "one of the good things in this provision is that this benefit will be available on loans taken to buy both under construction or ready houses
 haa, ek baat gaur karne vaali he ki kya 45 lakh ke makaan par lene vaale lone par aadmi jo byaaj detaa he vah saal bhar main saadhe teen lakh rupee tak hoga ki vah is praavdhaan kaa puraa phayda uthaa paaegaa
 The benefit of this provision will be available only on houses up to Rs 45 lakh
 yani lone kii raashi agar adhiktam 90 fisadi bhi maane to kareeb 40 lakh rupee kaa hi hoga
 'these are the screws to which some people may be disappointed' One of the screws in this announcement of the Minister is that it will be available only on loans taken from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, ie, during this period of one year
 yani aapkaa lone is avadhi main hi manjuur hona chahie, bhale hi makaan kii registry baad main ho
 This means that the old home loan holders will not get any benefit from it, ie many people will be disappointed with this provision
 yah praavdhaan isliye kiya gaya he taaki nae logon ko makaan kharidne ke liye protsaahit kiya ja sake
 Will the benefit be available only on 15-year loan? Balwant Jain said, 'there is no discussion in the budget document that it will be available only on 15-year loan, this benefit can also be available on long-term loan
 vitt mantri ne bajet bhaashan main bas ek udhaaharan se samajhaayaa he ki 15 lakh kaa lone lene waalon ko kitne kaa phayda hoga

 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is samay to mantri ke paas kuch bhi karne ko nahin he
 This is because the general elections are to be held in May 2019 and before that the government has to grapple with a very delicate fiscal situation in the matter of raising funds for all its social programs
 lekin vah aisa bhi to nahin kar sakati ki tel kii keemton ko nirantar tej hote rahane de or yah abhas de ki vah kuch nahin kar rahi he
 Therefore, Pradhan said what he could have said in these conditions as much as possible
 mantri ne kaha, "alpakaaleen or dirghakaalin, donon tarah ke samaadhaanon ke liye kai saare vikalp talaashe ja rahe hai
 He then quickly emphasized the role of state governments in reducing value-added tax (VAT)
 unka kahana tha ki rajya is kar ko kam karke keemten neeche laa sakate hai
 VAT is a major source of income for state governments
 unhone kaha, "sangheey dhaanche main main rajyon se apil hi kar saktaa hum'' (dekhen baatcheet)

 The government increased excise duty when fuel prices were down
 ab jab keemten zyada hai to unhen utpaada shulk kam kar dena chahie, chaahe uskaa nateeja jo bhi ho
 However, some critics are dismissive of the government's plea about social sector spending
 ve kehete hai ki yah kharch ab tak paryaapt nahin rahaa he

 ''iske ulat 2014 se 2016 ke bich khaas taur par shiksha va swasthya main kharch main khaasi katautee kii gai
 Of course, most of the time, the central government has made a lot of profit from falling fuel prices

 Will there be economic hardship of oil prices if the prices of crude oil continue to rise in the international market? Experts point out that high crude oil prices will affect three important sectors
 rajkoshiya paksh par yah asar hoga ki sarkaar ko alpiji or kerosene ko bazaar bhav se kam mulya par bechney ke liye utpaada shulk main katautee or tel companiyon ko baari sabsidi deni hogi
 If the price of crude oil is applied at $ 65 per barrel, then it will increase the gross fiscal deficit in the ratio of GDP by 10-12 basis points
 ek aadhaar ank ek pratishat ank ke sauven hisse ke baraabar hota he
 Increasing crude oil prices by $ 10 per barrel from the current level will increase inflation by 50 basis points in 2019
 teesri, tel kii keemton main vruddhi se mahangaai bad sakati he or anya sookshm sanketakon par bhi iskaa asar hoga
 According to Joshi, "if you get a rough calculation, the increase in crude oil price by $ 10 per barrel can increase India's fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP by 8 basis points and similarly the current account deficit will increase by 40 basis points
" If other things remain unchanged

 However, recent calculations by the PPAC show that if crude oil prices reach the $ 70-80 per dollar per barrel range, then India needs to buy around that much oil at around Rs 2 lakh crore
 atirikt kharch karne pad sakate hai
 To eliminate this effect, India is looking for new oil exporters as well as countries that accept different types of payments in place of dollars instead of crude oil
 udhaaharan ke liye iran or iraq euro main bhugtan lete hai
 They are becoming India's most trusted trading partner in the oil business and our dependence on Saudi Arabia, who is paying in dollars, is steadily declining
 sarkaar kya kar sakati heis prakaar yah saaf he ki tel kii badhati keemton par ankush lagaana na sirf janaakrosh ko sanbhaalane ke liye jaruri he balki sarkaar ke paise ke ankaganit ko or arthvyavastha ko durust rakhane ke liye bhi jaruri he
 But what are the options before the government and what are the possibilities of the government going to those options? One way to reduce oil prices is to bring them under the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 joshi ke anusaar, "jiesti main kar kii sarvocch dar 28 pratishat hi he jo tel par vasuuli ja rahi maujuuda karon kii dar se bahut kam he
 "in the current debate of bringing oil products into GST, it should also not be forgotten that this will reduce the income of the state governments and will bring additional pressure on them, but at present it is only a proposal
" iske alaava, yah ek vighatnkaaree kadam ho saktaa he, jise sarkaar is samay nahin chaahati
 Second, to tell India's largest domestic oil producer that it has made huge profits during the decline in crude oil prices and that it currently sells oil at low prices in refineries
 badale main, sarkaar is saal se kam labhaansh mangakar form kii kshatipurti kare
 There are reports that the government is planning to impose heavy tax on ONGC
 baharhaal paarikh kehete hai ki ve form par kar lagane ke khilaaf hai kyonki "oengisi par tex lagaana bilkul vaisaa hi he jaisaa sarkaar khud par tex lagaae
 "thirdly, the oil should be purchased in a discount form instead of the purchase in Asian premium currently being made
 iske liye in deshon ke saath bahut bade str ke molbhav kii jarurat hogi
 As Pradhan claims that he is strengthening relations by visiting various oil producing countries, it is expected that he will convince the supplier countries to reduce the price
 sarkaar utpaada shulk ko kam karne se hichak rahi he kyonki use dar he ki isse isaki saamaajik yojanaon par asar pad saktaa he
 Another option is to pressure the states to cut VAT

 But states are taking time before considering any cuts that are putting force on the center's forehead

 He said that he came to India on a medical attendant visa, which expired in December 2016 and now he will be deported soon
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Parties have been raising funds in the traditional way for the candidates who have entered the electoral fray, such as through party workers, well-wishers, allied organizations
 ab bhi isi tareeke se fund jutaya ja rahaa he, lekin nae raajnneetik halaat main partiyon ne chanda jutaney kaa tarika badla he
 Age has changed and the trend of digital transactions has increased, which political parties are also cashing in on
 online fund ekatrit karne kaa nayaa jariya bana he croudfnding
 At the same time, Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate Kanhaiya Kumar, who called the current trend of contesting elections as a bourgeois way, has appealed to the crowd through crowdfunding
 lekin unke is kadam ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 What is Crowdfunding There are many ways to raise money from the market for education, health, religious and political campaigns
 inamen se ek he croudfnding
 It is also a way to raise funds
 croudfnding kisi khaas pariyojna, bijness venture athwa saamaajik kalyaan ke liye janata se choti-choti rakam jutaney kii prakriya he
 For this, the path of online platform or social networking is adopted
 isamen fund jutaney vaala sambhavit daandaataaon yaa niveshkon ko fund jutaney kaa kaaran bataata he
 In this, the donors have to tell about their purpose
 is muhim main ve kaise yogadan kar sakate hai, uskaa bhi puraa byoraa hota he
 Equity-based crowdfunding is illegal as per the rule law
 lekin pear-tu-pear lending par bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) kaa niyantran he
 SEBI has, however, market regulator Sebi (SEBI) issued new rules on crowd funding
 taaja niyam nai companiyon ko fund jutaney ke saath aise madhyamon ke durupyog ko rokane main madad karenge
 The rules state that only entities registered with SEBI will be provided with crowdfunding platforms
 iske madhyam se companiyaan salanaa 10 karod rupee tak juta sakati hai
 In view of the danger associated with the new means of fund raising, SEBI has proposed that only recognized investors will be allowed to participate in crowd funding activities
 bazaar main soochibaddh companiyaan, riel estate kaarobaar or vittiya kshetra se judi companiyaan isamen hissaa nahin le sakengi
 Communal crowdfunding is involved in donations and award based crowdfunding
 yah puri tarah se kanoonee he
 This is the most popular way of raising funds for social welfare nowadays
 croudfnding se judi websiten amuman apane plateform kaa istemaal karne ke liye fees vasuulati hai
 With their help, a lot of funds are raised in a very short time
 croudfnding company kaa sahaara abhi tak burjua kahi jane vaali partiyaan masalan bhartiya janata party (bijepi), congress, diemke or aam aadmi party (aap) jaise dal lete rahe hai
 But Communist Party of India (CPI) candidate Kanhaiya Kumar from Begusarai in Bihar also ourdemocracy for crowdfunding
 in kii madad le rahe hai or bataaya ja rahaa he ki unhen ab 30 lakh rupee chande ke rup main mil chuke hai
 Many crowdfunding giants like Milap, Kyoto have arrived in India
 raajnneetik chande kaa nayaa arthshaastrabhi raajnneetik chanda paane ke maamle main bijepi sabase aage he
 It is also the richest political party in the country
 sabase pehle is party ne micro funding ke liye namo app ke jariye yah kaam shuru kiya or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek hajaar rupee kaa daan kar aupchaarik taur par isaki shuruyaat kii
 He appealed in a tweet by saying, 'donate through the Narendra Modi app for BJP
 main aap sabhi se app ke madhyam se yogadan karne kii apil karata hum or saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita kaa sandesh den
 You can donate from Rs 5 to Rs 1000 through the Narendra Modi app
 'bijepi ke netaa is abhiyaan ko matadaataaon se party ko jodne kaa ek tarika bhi bataate hai
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party has also been raising political donations through online mediums
 desh main in donon partiyon kii is muhim ke baad duusare raajnneetik dalon ne bhi yah rasta apanaaya he
 The change in laws makes the Election Commission worried that the amount of funding from unknown sources to political parties is very high, but electoral bonds have not made any difference
 association of democratic riforms (ADR) ke raajnneetik dalon ke audit report se pataa chalata he ki saal 2004-05 se 2017-18 ke dauraan rashtriya raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale chande kaa 66 fisadi hissaa agyaat sroton se aata he
 The electoral bond has been challenged in the Supreme Court and hearing is on
 chunaav ayog bhi chunavi bond ko lekar chintaa jataa chukaa he
 In the Supreme Court, the Commission says that changes in several laws related to political donations will have 'serious consequences' on transparency
 ayog ne kaha ki 'epasiare 2010' kanoon main badlaav se raajnneetik dal bina jaanch vaala videshi chanda praapt karenge jisase bhartiya nitiyaan videshi companiyon se prabhavit ho sakati hai
 The Election Commission, which filed an affidavit in the apex court, said that on 26 May 2017, it had written a letter to the Ministry of Law and Justice to convey its view that changes in the income tax law, public representation law and finance law would be against transparency in the donations of political parties

" ’ yang ke masik samvaadadaata sammelan par sarkari samachar agency shinhua ne apni report main arunachal pradesh kaa ullekh nahin kiya or dakshin tibet ke taur par iskaa hawala diya he

 'he said,' China's position on the dispute in the region is clear and consistent
 ’ china arunachal pradesh par dakshini tibet ke rup main daawa karata he
 Yang said, "the consensus between the two sides to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Actual Control is important
 ’bharat sarkaar ne pichley saptaah elaan kiya tha ki vah 54 nayi simavarti chaukiyon kii sthapana karegaa or arunachal pradesh main seemaa ke aasapaas dhanchaagat vikaas ko badhaane ke liye 175 karod rupee ke package kii ghoshnaa bhi kii gai thi
 Yang's remarks on border posts and road networks in Arunachal Pradesh are in line with the views expressed earlier by the Chinese Foreign Ministry
 is mudde par videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa hua chunaying ne purv main kaha tha ki seemaa ke sawaal kaa antim samaadhaan lambit hone tak, ham ummid karte hai ki bhartiya paksh aisi koi karrwai karne se bachegaa jo sawaal ko pechida banaati ho
 Input: from language kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ne team anna par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ve un muddon ko uthaa rahe hai jinhen ucchtam nyaayalay khaarij kar chukaa he or agar unhen usapar bhi vishwaas nahin he to ve sanyukt raashtra se sampark kar sakate hai
 The Law Minister said, 'they should write a letter to the United Nations
 bharat main ucchtam nyaayalay se adhik swatantra kya ho saktaa he
 They want an impartial inquiry into such cases which the Supreme Court has rejected and rejected
 ’ team anna un 15 kendriya mantriyon ke khilaaf swatantra jaanch gathit karne kii maang kar rahi hai jinke khilaaf unhone kuch aarope lagaae hai
 The government has already rejected the demand
 team anna ne majboot lokapal ke gathan or kendriya mantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii jaanch ke liye vishesh dal ke gathan kii maang ko lekar anischitkaaleen hadtaal shuru kii

 He said, 'the bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha

 Addressing a Sankalp rally organized by the JDU on Wednesday at ITI Maidan in Begusarai district to give Bihar a special state status, Nitish targeted the Prime Ministerial candidate of BJP, Narendra Modi, saying that people were talking about the chair
 unhone tanj kasate hue kaha, 'de de ram dilaa de ram, pradhanmantri kii kursi par bitha de ram
 ' nitish ne kaha ki unhone sankalp liya he ki sampradayik sadbhaav ko kaayam rakhenge, chaahe jo bhi qurbaani deni pade, lekin sadbhaav ko hameshaa barkaar rakhenge
 He said that people live for the chair and die for the chair, but they live for the development and progress of Bihar and to maintain harmony and harmony in the society here
 nitish ne kaha ki siddhant ke aadhaar par unhone endie se naata todaa he, jab tak endie atal bihari vaajapeyi ke banaae raste par chal rahaa tha or samjhaute ke anusaar vivaadit mudde or vivaadit vyakti (narendra modi) ko saamne nahin laane kii shart par chal rahaa tha, to gathbandhan thik dhang se chal rahaa tha
 But if they changed their path, it was better to stay away from the alliance
 unhone kaha ki vah sampradayik raajnneeti ko sweekaar nahin kar sakate hai
 The BJP had assured that it would not do such an act contrary to the agreement

 Indian cricket team is in captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's hometown Ranchi after registering an impressive win over England in the second ODI played in Kochi
 dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya team shanivaar ko ranchi main khelegi or uskaa ekmaatr makasad captain ke shahar main pehali baar ho rahe antarrashtriya cricket match ko jeetna hoga
 By winning this match at the HEC International Cricket Stadium Complex, the Indian team can take a 2–1 lead in this five-match series and give a wonderful gift to the Ranchi people who have been waiting for this crucial moment for years
 jharkhand main isse pehle jamshedpur main antarrashtriya match hue hai, lekin rajdhani ranchi ko pehali baar is tarah kii mejabani kaa mauka mila he
 After a commendable performance in Kochi, the Indian team seems to have some problems
 captain dhoni ke netritv main ballebaajon ne jis tarah kaa pradarshan kiya tha, vah kaabile tarif he, lekin sheersh kram kii naakaami ab bhi team ko saal rahi he
 This is the only aspect about which India has been concerned for the last one year
 mausam main nami ko dekhte hue ranchi main bhi swing or seem gendbaajon ko madad milane ke asaar hai
 In such a situation, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who smashed England's top order with three wickets in Kochi, will once again be expected to perform brightly
 ranchi main chunki pehali baar kisi antarrashtriya match kaa aayojan ho rahaa he, lihaaja pich ko lekar zyada kuch nahin kaha or likhaa gaya he
 In such a situation, the captain has to be careful about team composition
 vaise kochi main jeet hasil karne vaali team main parivartan ke asaar kam dikhaai de rahe hai
 Ravindra Jadeja's all-round performance in Kochi has brought news of happiness for India
 saalon se adad harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii kami se jujh rahi bhartiya team ko jadeja ke aatmavishvaas se nayaa aatmavishvaas mila he
 It is expected that Jadeja will continue his performance in Ranchi and the upcoming matches as well
 england kii team ne rajkot main acchhee ballebaaji or gendbaaji kii thi, lekin kochi ekadivasiy main uske ballebaaj stareey pradarshan nahin kar sake the
 The comments england kii sthiti bharat ke ulat he
 His opening pair has been performing consistently well, but the team deviated from the rhythm after his failure in Kochi
 ab ranchi main captain elister cook or ian bel ek baar phir team ko acchhee shuruyaat dene kaa prayaas karenge
 As far as bowling is concerned, the English bowlers, who were in good rhythm till the middle of the innings in Kochi, were seen wandering in the final time, which was taken advantage of by Dhoni and Jadeja and gave India a good score
 english gendbaajon kaa pradarshan stareey rahaa he or is kaaran unke lay main lautne kii ummid he
 Captain Cook has to keep in mind that the guarantee of the success of his bowlers in India is very low, because the pitches here are flat and helpful to the batsmen, so he should be more and more dependent on the performance of his batsmen
 would be better
 echisi international cricket stadium complex main hone vaale is match ko jitkar bhartiya team paanch maichon kii is shrunkhlaa main 2-1 kii badhat hasil kar sakati he or varshon se is ahm kshan kaa intjaar kar rahe ranchivasiyon ko shandaar tohfa de sakati he
 There have been international matches in Jamshedpur before in Jharkhand, but the capital Ranchi got a chance to host such for the first time
 kochi main saraahneey pradarshan ke baad bhartiya team kii mushkilen kuch kam hoti dikh rahi hai
 The way the batsmen performed under the leadership of captain Dhoni is a commendable compliment, but the failure of the top order is still a year for the team
 yahi ek paksh he, jise lekar bharat beete ek saal se chintit rahaa he
 Given the moisture in the weather, swing and seam bowlers in Ranchi are also likely to get help
 aise main kochi main teen wicket lekar england ke sheersh kram ko dharashayi karne vaale bhubaneshwar kumaar se phir ek baar chamakdaar pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 Since an international match is being held for the first time in Ranchi, nothing much has been said and written about the pitch
 aise main captain ko team sangyojan ko lekar sachet rahanaa hoga
 However, the chances of change in the winning team in Kochi are less visible
 kochi main rabindra jadeja kaa harfanmaulaa pradarshan bharat ke liye khushi kii khabar lekar aayaa he
 The Indian team, which has been battling a shortage of all-rounders for years, has gained new confidence with Jadeja's confidence
 ummid he ki jadeja apana yah pradarshan ranchi or aane vaale maichon main bhi jari rakhenge
 The England team batted well and bowled in Rajkot, but their batsmen could not perform at the Kochi ODI level
 tippaniyan The situation in England is unlike that of India
 uski salaami jodi lagaataar acha pradarshan karti rahi he, lekin kochi main uske naakaam hone ke baad team lay se bhatak gai
 Now in Ranchi, captain Alastair Cook and Ian Bell will once again try to give the team a good start
 jahaan tak gendbaaji kaa sawaal he, to kochi main pari ke madhyantar tak acchhee lay main dikh rahe english gendbaaj antim samay main lay se bhatakate dikhe, jiskaa phayda dhoni or jadeja ne uthaaya tathaa bharat ko acha score diya
 The English bowlers have performed well and are expected to return to their rhythm
 captain cook ko yah dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki bharat main unke gendbaajon kii safalataa kii guarantee bahut kam rahati he, kyonki yahaan kii pichen sapaat or ballebaajon ko madad pahunchane vaali hoti hai, lihaaja vah apane ballebaajon ke pradarshan par adhik se adhik ashrith rahen to zyada behatar hoga

 Explain that the opposition parties had alleged that the procedure is not being followed properly in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha chairman venkaiya naidu kaa kahana he ki hamen jo chitthee mili he, usamen do mukhya baton ko uthaaya gaya he

 Even this man told the truth but by saving his identity

 Local leaders are occupying their land, but they are unable to do anything because they are still on duty
 gauratlab he ki biguef jawan tej bahadur ke chaunkaa dene vaale kharaab khaane kii shikayati video ke baad jaise surakshabalon main javaanon se bhedbhaav ko lekar shikayati pitara khul gaya he

 Exclusive: Deepika speaks on Padmavat's fabulous collection- Is the answer to those who protest is the story of Secret Superstar? The story of the film Secret Superstar is of Insia (zaira Wasim), a girl from Vadodara, Gujarat
 vah ek singer bananaa chaahati he
 Insia's biggest obstacle in fulfilling her dreams is her father Farukh (raj Arjun)
 wo apane pita ke dar se kabhi apane sapane ke bare main baat nahin kar paati, lekin insiya kii maa najma (meher vij) apni beti ke sapane ko puraa karwaanaa chaahati he
 Insia wants to go to Mumbai to fulfill her dreams
 isi bich uski mulaakaat stregling mujeec diarector shakti kumaar (aamir khan) se hoti he
 After the entry of Shakti, the story gets a lot of twists
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye nitish kumaar kaa naam aage karne vaale logon ke khilaaf kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue bihar ke mukhyamantri ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki unhen in sab baton se dukh hota he
 He said that such people are not friendly to him
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne is sheersh pad ke liye apana naam uchhaale jane par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha, ‘‘jo bhi meraa naam pradhanmantri pad ke liye aage karata he vah meraa hitaishi nahin he
 i feel sad about all these things
 ’’ unhone ek kaarykram se itar samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main yah baat kahi
 On the rhetoric of his party leaders as the prime ministerial candidate, Nitish said, "all this is a useless thing"
 ham is baat par kuch bolnaa nahin chaahate hai
 '' ullekhneey he ki jadyu ke vayovruddh netaa or bihar rajya yojana board ke upaadhyaksh harikishor singh ne beete dinon kaha tha ki nitish pradhanmantri ke pad ke yogya ummidavaar hai
 The NDA should present him as the prime ministerial candidate
 nitish pehle bhi kah chuke hai ki pradhanmantri pad kii daud main vah nahin he
 The comments mukhyamantri kaa taaja bayaan aise samay main saamne aayaa he jab elahabaad main mahakumbh main dharmik netaaon ne desh ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke samarthan main golbandi shuru kar di he
 But BJP national president Rajnath Singh has banned the saffron party leaders from saying anything about it
 gauratlab he ki modi ko rajg kaa pradhanmantri pratyaashee banane kii kai bhaajapa netaaon kii maang kaa jadyu ke kuch netaaon ne virodh kiya tha
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reacted to the elevation of his name for this top post, saying, "whoever puts my name forward for the post of Prime Minister is not my best friend
 mujhe in sab baton se dukh hota he
 He said this in an interaction with reporters on the sidelines of a program
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main apane dal ke netaaon kii bayaanbaji par nitish ne kaha, ‘‘yah sab phaltu baat he
 We do not want to speak on this matter
 ’’ It is worth mentioning that JDU veteran leader and Bihar State Planning Board Vice President Harikeshore Singh had said recently that Nitish is a qualified candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 rajg ko unhen pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karnaa chahie
 Nitish has said earlier that he is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister's latest statement comes at a time when religious leaders at Mahakumbh in Allahabad have started mobilization in support of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the country
 lekin bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne is vishay main bhagava party ke netaaon ke kuch bhi kehane par pabandi laga di he
 Significantly, the demand of many BJP leaders to make Modi the prime ministerial candidate of the NDA was opposed by some JDU leaders

 When the ruling party was defeated at the center in the state, questions began to arise from politics to political leadership
 vipaksh ke saath apano ne bhi narendra modi kii netritv kshamta ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye
 But forget about the election of UP ahead and in such a situation it becomes important that what is the 'political mood of the country'? Grapindia Today Group and Karvy of Gira Modi government wanted to know from 13576 voters in 19 states of the country How much of the impact of Prime Minister Modi's wave in the country at this time? The results of this survey show that if the elections are held now, the chair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be saved, but the seats of UPA have increased
 survey ke mutabik, maujuuda samay main chunaav hone par endie ko 286 siten milenge, jabaki upie 110 siton par kabja jamaa sakati he
 It is worth noting that the NDA had 336 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, while the Congress was reduced to double digits with 59 seats
 taaja survey main jahaan, endie kii siton or vot percent main giravat ai he, vahiin upie kii siten doguni ho gai hai or uske vot pratishtata main bhi vruddhi hui he
 On the other hand, speaking of vote percentage, if elections are to be held now, 37 percent votes will be in the account of NDA, 27 percent in UPA account and 36 percent in others
 kshetravaar vot ke bantwaare kii baat karen to desh ke purvi hisse se sabase adhik vot endie ko milane vaale hai
 The bjp-led NDA is likely to get 30 per cent of the vote, UPA 27 per cent and the other faction 43 per cent

 That is, around 62 percent people are satisfied with the action of the Indian government in the Pathankot attack

 jabaki sirf 40 fisadi logon ne hi yah kaha ki modi sarkaar 'achche din' lekar ai he
 How was the government's performance? People have given mixed reactions to the performance of the Modi government's tenure so far
 47 fisadi ne ise upie ke mukaable behatar bataaya he, jabaki 42 fisadi ne ise upie se kharaab (15%) yaa upie ke samaan (27%) mana he
 When will black money come? 53% of the people involved in the survey also said that the Modi government is failing to bring back black money from foreign banks

 However, 34 percent say that the government has succeeded in controlling inflation
 duusari ore, jab logon se poocha gaya ki kya modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad unke aarthik halaat main badlaav aae hai? iske jawaab main 43 fisadi ne kaha ki 'haa' unke halaat pehle se behatar hue hai

 The Supreme Court is hearing the Ayodhya land dispute case
 sunni vakf board ne supreme court ke har din sunwaayee karne ke faisle par aapatti jataai he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has reacted sharply to this objection by the Sunni Waqf Board
 bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki pehle har baar taarikh milti thi, ab jab supreme court har din sunwaayee karne ko taiyaar he to phir maamle ko taalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The Sunni Waqf Board is weakening its stand by making such statements
 bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha ki sunni vakf board ke bayaan se kisi kaa koi phayda nahin hone vaala hai
 Both sides have already said that the decision of the Supreme Court will be valid
 hai court apane faisle main pehle hi kah chukaa he ki vahaan par ram mandir tha
 130 crore people of the country want that Ram temple should be constructed in Ayodhya
 ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par supreme court ne hafte main paanch din karne kaa faisla kiya he
 But the Sunni Waqf Board has expressed its inability on this decision
 shuukravaar ko jab court main maamle kaa sunwaayee shuru hui to sunni vakf board ke vakil ne chif justise ke saamne apni baat rakhi
 An appeal was made before the court by the Muslim party that he could not help the court for hearing five days a week
 sunni vakf board kii taraf se vakil rajeev dhawan ne adaalat se kaha ki ye sirf ek hafte kaa maamla nahin he, balki lambey samay tak chalane vaala cese he
 He said that we have to read translation papers day and night and make other preparations
 is par CJI ranjan gogoi ne kaha he ki hamane aapaki baat sun lee he, ham aapako bataaenge
 At the same time, Yogi's Minority Minister Mohsin Raza has opposed the Sunni Waqf Board for opposing Sunni Waqf Board's Supreme Court to impose a day to day hearing and oppose hearing for 3 to 5 days of hearing every week
 mohsin raja ne kaha, 'lagata sunni vakf board kaa daawa kamjor he or unke paas court pesh karne ke tathy nahin he isliye aakhri daur jab supreme court faisla dene ke kareeb panhuch rahaa he to ye bhi ek roda atakane kaa prayaas he
 If the other party did not raise such a thing, then the Sunni board's statement shows that their claim is weak

 Varun said that employees of every section get their salary increased according to their hard work and honesty, but in the last 10 years, mps raised their salary only 7 times by raising their hands
 or jab unhone yah mudda uthaaya to ek baar piemo se phone aayaa ki kyon aap hamaari museebataan badha rahe hai
 However, Varun Gandhi also said that he is grateful to the Prime Minister that he took action on this issue
 ab saansadon kaa vetan keval haath uthaane se nahin badhegaa, balki sansadeey samiti tay karegi
 Questioning the education system, Varun Gandhi gave an example of UP schools while questioning the education system of the country
 unhone kaha ki upi ke skulon main shiksha ke alaava sabhi kaarykram hote hai
 In UP schools, religious and wedding programs are held today, the process after the funeral is done here, children play cricket and leaders come to deliver speeches in schools
 varuna gandhi ne kaha ki har saal shiksha par kehane ke 3 lakh karod rupee kharch kiye jate hai lekin 89 fisadi paisa bhawanon par kharch hota he jise shiksha nahin kah sakate
 He said that today there is a shortage of five and a half lakh teachers in the country, which all post graduates of the country can complete in one stroke by teaching one year for free
 kisaanon kii badahaali kii batvaruna gandhi ne kaha ki aaj desh main 40 fisadikisantheke par jameen lekar kheti karte hai, jo gaiyrkanoonee he

 In the midst of the ongoing battle to take over the chair of Maharashtra, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut announced through his Twitter at around 5 pm that congress-ncp and Shiv Sena would hold a public parade of their mlas at the Grand Hyatt
 raut ne daawa kiya ki yahaan par maha vikaas aghadi ko samarthan dene vaale kul 162 vidhayak maujuud rahenge
 At seven o'clock in the evening, hundreds of media persons gathered outside the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai
 maha vikaas aghadi ke netaaon ne daawa kiya ki grand hotel ke andar 162 se zyada vidhayak maujuud hai
 This gathering of mlas was addressed by veteran leaders like Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Ashok Chavan and Mallikarjun Kharge
 pavaar kaa bos avataradikhmuman shant dikhne vaale sharad pavaar ne hayaat hotel main aakraamak chhavi kaa parichay diya
 After being able to get the mlas of the three parties together, Sharda appeared in Pawarjosh
 haalanki pavaar ne kuch hi din pehle piem modi se mulaakaat kii thi
 But the BJP lashed out at this meeting
 pavaar ne kaha ki bijepi ne goa main sarkaar banane ke liye asanvaidhanik tareeke apanaae hai lekin bijepi ko jaan lenaa chahie ki ye goa nahin maharashtra he or unhen sabak sikhaane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Sharad Pawar has told the mlas that this misconception is being spread that Ajit Pawar will issue whip and ask to vote in favor of BJP and whip which will not be accepted will lose the membership of the assembly
 pavaar ne vidhayakon ke saamne is baat ko khaarij kiya or kaha ki ve khud sunishchit karenge ki kisi vidhayak kii sadsyta nahin jaae
 Sharad Pawar said that Ajit Pawar has been removed from the post of NCP Legislature Party leader and does not have the right to issue whip
 pavaar ne kaha ki ajit pavaar par jald ection hoga
 Pawar said BJP does not believe in democratic process
 sharad pavaar ne vishwaas jataate hue kaha ki is gathbandhan ko vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne main koi dikkat nahin hogi
 He said that if needed, he can take more than 162 mlas in his favor
 pavaar ne daawa kiya ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti main teen dalon kaa ye saath 5 saal nahin 50 saal ke liye he
 'we will tell you what the Shiv Sena is
' Forming a government in Maharashtra has been a nose fight for Shiv Sena

 They will not only get acceptance at the national level but they will also come to the center of national politics

 Attacking the BJP, Uddhav said that the principle of Satyamev Jayate should not be just jai for power
 uddhav ne bijepi ko chunauti bhare shabdon main kaha ki ab ham bataaenge ki shivasena kya cheez he
 Uddhav also wished this alliance a long life

 However Mallikarjun Kharge was also present in the meeting
 chavaan ne daawa kiya ki is vakt is hotel main congress-ensipi or shivasena ke 162 nahin balki usase zyada vidhayak maujuud hai
 Ashok Chavan thanked Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the approval of the alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ko is gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaanaa chahie
 Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has proved her strength by expanding her cabinet for the first time in 10 months
 is vistaar main unhone un sabhi netaaon ko darkinar kar diya jo unke liye pareshaani ban sakate the
 He also tried to show that there was no tug of war between him and the high command, which was being speculated
 27 aktubar ko raaje ne 15 mantriyon ko shapath dilaai
 There are four cabinet ministers
 unhone arun chaturvedi or hem singh bhadaana ko padonnat karke cabinet mantri bana diya
 Raje kept 46 portfolios with her and thwarted expansionary pressures as some mlas feared being angry with the rest
 200 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main bijepi ke 160 vidhayak hai or kuch ko mantri bana, apane vafaadaaron sahit baakiyon ko chhod dena unke liye mushkil tha
 However, this expansion will definitely help them in running the government
 isse raaje ne yah bhi dikhaaya he ki pradesh bijepi main unheen kii baat maani jaati he
 The green signal for expansion was received only in August, but he also chose its time with his convenience and will
 ve sangh ke udaar netaaon or apane vafaadaaron ko mantri banane main safal raheen
 His biggest success is that he did not make his only outspoken opponent Ghanshyam Tiwari a minister within the party
 centre ke kai aalaa netaaon ne tiwadi ko shaamil karne kii salaah di thi
 This has led to Tiwari's attempts to become an unaccompanied Brahmin leader
 brahman lobby ke jabardast dabaav main raaje ne agle hi din chaturvedi ko cabinet mantri kaa darja de diya
 In this way, he made the RSS happy and Tiwari's height shorter in a single instant
 alabatta is kadam se aresas hi kamjor hua he, kyonki chaturvedi ko baar-baar unke kad se zyada mahatv diya gaya he
 At first he was made Minister of State, even though he became an MLA for the first time
 us vakt aresas ne yah kahkar unki pairvi kii thi ki ve adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 Now, for the first time, many mlas who have been elected after making him a cabinet minister in 10 months are jealous
 raaje ne india today se kaha, ''pehali baar chunakar aae kai vidhayak mantri banane ke kaabil hai
 Still i did not include him in detail so that other mlas who were deprived of their ministers would not mind
 "raaje ne narpat singh rajvi ko bhi mantri nahin banaaya
 Rajvi is the son-in-law of the late BJP leader Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 isse unka apane sasur kii rajput viraasat kaa vaahak banane kaa sapana adhuraa rah gaya he
 Instead, Raje added Rajpal Singh to the cabinet, which, despite being associated with the RSS, would not make it more difficult for him
 raajapaal ko raaje ne shahari vikaas or awaas jaise mahatvapurn mahakme kii jimmedaari di he
 He did not even make Rao Rajendra Singh a minister
 ve apni budhimatta or swatantra nazariye kii vajah se raaje ke liye mantriparishad main sarvanumati banane kii raah main roda ban sakate the
 By not including them, Raje has deprived the Council of Ministers of prejudiced and rational views
 unhone aise kuch anya logon ko bhi jagah di he, jo yaa to pehali baar vidhayak bane hai yaa duusare darje ke maane jate hai
 Among them are those who have the honor of the Sangh and they will compensate the senior and established leaders left out of the cabinet to balance caste and regional
 unhone party ke diggaj netaa om maathur ke prabhaav kaa muqabla karne ke liye unheen ke ilaake ke pushpendra singh ko mantri banaaya he
 Both new and old faces have been taken in detail, but they have no experienced minister
 chaar nae cabinet mantriyon main se sunkshardar goyal raaje ke pehle kaarykaal main kuch vakït ke liye rajyamantri the
 Rajpal Singh Shekhawat and Drs

 During the reconciliation talks, Savita offered that if her husband gets a pucca toilet built at her house, she is ready to return to her in-laws' house
 adaalat ne tippanee kii, kisi mahila kaa khule main shouch karnaa maanviya aadhaar par uchit nahin he
 Every person has the right to perform daily routine of respect and a husband also has the moral obligation to provide facilities to his wife according to her dignity
 jaj ne devkaran ko aadesh diya ki vah 24 disambar se pehle apane nivas sthaan par pakke shauchalay kaa nirmaan karke adaalat ko isse avgat karaae
 However, the case did not end here
 jaisaa ki savita ke vakil praveen choudhary ne buudhvaar ko bataaya, 24 disambar ko jab maamle kii phir sunwaayee hui, to pataa chalaa ki devkaran ne adaalat ke aadesh par apane ghar pakkaa shauchalay to banavaa liya he, lekin usne isamen daravaaje kii jagah paradaa laga rakhaa he
 She said, "my party Savita insisted in the court that unless her husband does not get a door in her pucca toilet built, she will not return to her in-law's house
" maamle kii samvenshiltaa ko samajhate hue mere vipakshi vakil ne bhi danpati ke bich jari samjhauta vaarta ko antim nattejey tak pahunchane main madad kii
 As the negotiation proceeded, the two sides finally agreed that Devkaran would complete the construction of the toilet by the next date (january 10, 2014) and put it in the door and take his wife with him to court during the next hearing
 Will be ready uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne ravivaar ko apane mantrimandal ke sahyogiyon ke saath IIM lakhanu main sushasan or prabandhan kii baarikiyaan samajhiin
 Chief Minister Yogi said on this occasion that life is for learning

 Wherever there is an opportunity for learning, it must be taken advantage of
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar vigat dhai varshon main janata kii aashaaon or aakankshaon kii kasuti par khari utari he
 The Chief Minister was speaking at the Leadership Development 'manthan-1' program organized at IIM
 unhone kaha ki IIM ke sahyog se manthan kaarykram ke teen vishesh satron kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa pratham satr aaj yojit kiya gaya he
 Such training programs can be helpful in all round development of the state
 unhone kaha ki pradesh sarkaar rajya ko shreshth banane kii disha main sakaaratmak prayaas kar rahi he
 In view of this, the State Government is getting support from IIM Institute to better know good governance, management, leadership skills and public participation
 pehali baar kisi rajya sarkaar ne desh main apane raajnneetik netritv kii dakshata ke liye desh ke shreshth prabandhan santhaan se prashikshan lene kaa faisla kiya he
 CM Yogi said that the state government is serving the people by adopting the concept of 'sabka Saath - Sabka Vikas - Sabka Vishwas'
 apana anubhav saajha karte hue unhone kaha ki ek prashasnic adhikari dwaara diye gayi sujhaavon ko praathmik vidyalayon par lagu kiya, jiske sakaaratmak parinaam aaye

 Educationists of the state government's minister, iim-lucknow were also present on the occasion
 mahangaai dastak dene vaali he
 This is being said since the rise in the prices of crude oil in the global market
 lekin ab kendra main modi sarkaar ke aae aakhri purna bajet ne bhi tay kar di he ki desh main mahangaai aane vaali he
 In the Union Budget 2018, the government has decided to increase the minimum support price of agri products by one and a half times to double the income of farmers
 aarthik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki is faisle se desh main mahangaai ko dastak dene se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Significantly, in the budget presented in 2014 by the Modi government, it was believed that increasing the support price of the crop increases the prices of crop products in the country, due to which inflation is fixed
 darasal adhik samarthan mulya ke is nitigal faisle se kendra sarkaar ke khajaane par boj padegaa or aam aadmi ko genhu, chaaval, daal or tilhan tay nirdhaarit keemton se adhik par uplabdh hoga
 Due to this effect, the budget of the kitchen of the common man is bound to deteriorate
 isse sarkaar kaa rajasav ghaataa bhi bad jayega
 However, a major thing in this policy decision of the Central Government is that now the cost of farmers will be decided in the country to do farming
 maujuuda samay main laagat ko nirdhaarit karne kaa koi dhaancha maujuuda nahin he
 Therefore, if the minimum support price is raised with the intention of doubling the income of the farmers, then there is likely to be a big debate on the basis of the cost of the farmer
 ise padhein: bajet 2018: samajhen bajet kii khaas baaten or unka aap par asargauratlab he ki desh main khudara mahangaai pehle se hi bad rahi he or kachche tel kii badhati keemton se isamen or ijaphe kii ummid he
 cpi-based retail inflation touched a 17-month peak in December 2017 and is above the Reserve Bank's target of 4 per cent
 isamen bhi khaadya saamagree kii mahangaai sabase ahm kaaran rahi he
 Now with the announcement of increase in support price, there is bound to be a big increase in food inflation in the country
 nunatam mulya main ijaphe par kisaanon kii pratikriya he ki desh main samarthan mulya main kharid nahin kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, instead of raising the support price, if the government announces that the farmers' produce will definitely be purchased by the government, then only the farmers will get direct benefit
 lihaaja, kaha ja saktaa he ki aam chunaavon se pehle aae is purna bajet main kendra sarkaar ne kisaanon ko raahat pahunchane ke liye yadi yah kadam uthaaya to iskaa khamiyaja desh main sabhi ko uthaanaa padegaa

 bharat ne bangladesh ko phir se aashwast kiya he ki seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ke jawan seemaa par ghuspaith karne vaale bangladeshiyon par goli nahin chalaayenge
 External Affairs Minister SM Krishna gave this assurance to Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dipu Moni during a two-day meeting of the Foreign Ministers of SAARC (south Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) held in Bhutan's capital Thimphu
 sarkari samachar agency bangladesh sangbad sangstha (bses) ke anusaar krishna ne moni se kaha ki "is mudde se nipatane ke liye paryaapt kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 "india regretted the January 7 incident in Home Secretary level talks in Dhaka last month in which a teenager named Falani was killed

 The family was returning from Delhi
 yah ghatana purvottar bangladesh ke kudigram ke paas seemaa par ghati thi
 The newspaper 'new Age' said on Wednesday that tension was rife in the village of Falani in Kudigram district as the local unit of the ruling Awami League announced to hold a rally at the same venue to protest against the killing of Falani

 ye chintaa khud se zyada garbh main pal rahe bachche ke liye hoti he
 No one can deny that pregnancy is the time when a woman needs the most care and avoidance
 ye sach he ki garbhavastha main mahila jo kuch khaati he or jis tarah se rahati he uskaa sidhaa asar uske hone vaale bachche par padataa he
 At the time of the birth of the first child, women are quite confused anyway
 wo ye tay karne main hi uljhi rah jaati hai ki kya sahi hoga or kya galat
 Although many books related to pregnancy are available in the market and elderly women at home are also there to give advice, but it should always be remembered that pregnancy is different
 ho saktaa he ki do mahilaon ke lakshan aapas main mail khate hon lekin donon ke halaat ek hon, jaruri nahin
 If you want your pregnancy to be happy and safe, then you can adopt these measures: 1
 folic acid kii paryaapt maatra lenaa bahut jaruri he
 The folic acid found in green leaves works to protect against many problems related to childbirth
 2
 Eating fruits is very important during pregnancy, but before eating any fruit, make sure that the fruits are well washed
 varanaa sankraman kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 3
 garbhavastha ke samay anda, chikan yaa machhlee khaanaa bahut phydemand hota he
 But it is very important to cook them well
 4
 Eat protein as much as possible
 protein bachche ke vikaas main mahatvapurn he
 If you want, you can get enough protein by making pulses, seeds and milk a part of your diet
 5
 While you need to take full care of your food and drink, it is also important that you do not forget any vaccination during this time
 agar aap kuch din let bhi ho jaati hai to doctor se paraamarsh lekar use turant lagava len
 6
 garbhavastha ke dauraan junk food khaane se parhez karnaa hi behatar hoga
 It contains high amounts of fat, due to which there may be a risk of cholesterol increase
 7
 It is very important to have a complete diet during pregnancy
 sharir ko sabhi poshak tatv paryaapt maatra main milane se hi bachche kaa bhi sahi vikaas hoga

 Come, know what is power dressing, how can we also enhance our personality by adopting power dressing in our everyday life
 paayal kahati hai ki meri najar main aapaki dressing, aapke vyaktitv kaa aainaa he
 Your dressing reflects your personality
 agar aap workaplace par kisi meeting main wel dressop hokar jate hai to ye vahaan acha prabhaav daalate hai
 i believe that if you wear something that makes you stylish along with being relaxed, then it is best for you
 nomita kalra ne tark dete hue kaha ki aap kisi corporate offis main trspenrent kapade nahin pahanakar agar jate hai, jisamen aapke tatu jhaank rahe hai
 In such a situation, we cannot send him to meet the client
 har offis kaa ek decorum bhi hota he
 Payal said that you should take it seriously
 ham har jagah krantikari kapade nahin pahan sakate
 There are some unwritten rules everywhere that we have to adopt
 paayal ne kaha ki hamen wel dress ke saath fishan ko follow karnaa bhi jaruri he
 On the question of sari, she said that she has been wearing saris from Indira Gandhi to Sonia Gandhi, yet why sari is not so popular in the board room today
 is par paayal ne kaha ki sari kaa chayan or use kairi karne ke liye alag-alag tareeke pataa hona chahie
 Selection of color in power dressing is also necessary
 Talking about power dressing, what is the relation of color with power? On this question, Payal says that from the history of India to our art, craft and food, everything is dotted with colors
 hamaare liye rangon kaa chayan karnaa bahut jaruri he, lekin rangon kaa chayan bhi bahut soch samajhakar karnaa chahie
 Not everyone can adopt every color
 jo color aapako suut karte hai, yaa jinamein aap sahaj hai, vahi apanaaen

 dilli main jismfaroshi kaa racket chalaane vaali sonu punjaban bhale hi jail main ho, lekin uskaa wo ganda dhandha, uske rishtedaar or jaankaar chalaa rahe the
 Sonu was running his sex racket business from inside the Punjaban jail, but his business has also been closed by Delhi Police
 police ne sonu punjaban ke do bhaaiyon samet 3 logon ko giraftaar kiya he, jo escort sarvice ke naam par logon se dhokhadhadi kar rahe the
 According to DCP Chinmay Biswal of South East Delhi, the Special Staff had received information that Sonu Punjaban's brothers in Nehru Place, East of Kailash and its surrounding areas along with one of their companions were cheating people in the name of Jismfaroshi 
 isi soochna ke aadhaar par police ne jaal bichaana shuru kiya
 On the 19th, when a vehicle was stopped after information, there were 3 people in it
 unke paas hathiyaar baraamad hue, poochtacha main unhone hairaan karne vaala khulaasa kiya
 In fact, two of the three were brothers Vijay and Sanjay Sonu Punjaban and one was their partner Rohit
 poochtacha main inhone bataaya ki ye log sonu punjaban ke liye escort services kaa dhandha kar rahe hai or is dhandhe kii aad main logon ke saath thagi or lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam de rahe hai
 These people had also included girls associated with Sonu in their gang
 gang se jude log pehle alag-alag web portal par escort sarvice ke naam se aid dete the, jisame kuch nami web portal bhi shaamil hai
 When a customer used to call them, they called him in Nehru Place and its vicinity and showed that person a girl and took an advance
 jab deal puri tarah se ho jaati to ladki isi dauraan jhagada kar ke vahaan se nikal jaati thi or ye bhi faraar ho jate the
 After questioning, it was found that if a customer demanded money back from them during this time, they would drive him away on the weapon
 shame ke kaaran koi bhi inaki shikaayat police se nahin karata tha
 It has also been revealed in the interrogation that at the behest of jailed Sonu Punjaban, he was also threatening a witness
 is gang ne ab tak saikadon logon ke saath thagi or lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 An 11-year-old innocent girl was brutally murdered in Surat, Gujarat

 Muslims from BJP to SP stand against this decision of the Muslim Law Board

 At the same time, the SP says that there is a constitution in the country and it should be followed

 In this regard, the proposal of Sharia courts will be discussed in the board meeting to be held in Delhi on 15 July

 On the creation of Sharia courts in every district, AIMIM President and Muslim Personal Law Board member Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted that it is not parallel to the court
 ise daarul kaja kaha jaataa he or 1993 se kaam kar rahe hai
 Please read the decision given by the Ministerial Supreme Court in the Vishnu Lochum case, when your affiliate VHP went to court on this issue

 All India Muslim Law Board Member Zafaryab Jilani said, 'we do not call them Sharia courts
 ye daarul kaja hai
 In these, Qazi resolves marital differences and quarrels and suggests ways of separation if the matter is not resolved
 har jile main sharia adaalaton (daarul-qaza) kholane kii board kii yojana ke bare main puche jane par jilani ne kaha ki daarul-kaza cameti kaa makasad he ki har jile main sharia adaalatein hon, taaki muslim log apane sharia masalon ko anya adaalaton main le jane ke bajaay daarul-kaza main sulajhaayen
 Zafaryab Jilani also said that the All India Personal Law Board introduced such a system in 1993
 yah koi nai baat nahin he
 The central government has nothing to do with this
 unka kahana he ki ise supreme court ne bhi jari rakhane kii anumati di thi
 The Supreme Court found that it is not a parallel court
 sunni moulana sufian nijaami AIMPLB ke kadam kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki sharia adaalaton ke vistaar se sharia ke tahat aane vaale muddon ko aasaani se suljhaayaa jayega
 While Maulana Saif Abbas of the Shia community is in opposition to this move of the board
 AIMPLB ne daawa kiya he ki uttar pradesh main kareeb 40 daarul-kaza hai
 a court costs at least 50 thousand rupees every month
 ab har jile main daarul-kaza kholane ke liye sansaadhan jutaney par vichaar-vimarsh hoga

 Culture not in clothes but in character bhartiya stock bazaar se jude 3 bade sanghathanon ne milakar ek ahm faisla liya he jiskaa lakshya bhartiya puunji ko videshi bazaaron main jane se rokna he
 Trading of derivatives linked to the Indian stock market has been banned in foreign stock exchanges
 desh ke 3 bade stock exenjon neshnal stock exange (enesai), bisai or metropolishan stock exange (emesaiai) ne milakar is par roak lagane kaa faisla liya
 He says that this led to Indian capital going into foreign markets
 videshi stock exange main jin bhi deryvatives main vyapaar ho rahaa he, un par roak lagaai ja rahi he
 This ban will come into force with immediate effect
 sutara bataate hai ki yah faisla sebi kii salaah ke baad liya gaya
 Such a move was taken when Singapore Exchange announced the introduction of a single stock future in all of the 50 stocks of NSE this week
 dar tha ki isse bhartiya paisa desh ke baahar chalaa jayega
 Similarly, the Sensex Future in Dubai will also not get any data from India
 is faisle ke baad ab desh ke stock exange singapore se chalane vaale esajex nifti ke liye data nahin de sakenge
 India Today editor and economic analyst Anshuman Tiwari says that the move seems to be conservative at the moment
 haalanki, yah bharat kii us vaishvik chhavi se mail nahin khaataa he, jisamen ise videshi puunji ke liye ubharta hua kshetra bataaya jaataa he
 It is also not a good sign for the globalization of Indian financial products such as local currency and masala bonds
 unhone kaha he ki somvaar ko bazaar main iske sanket dekhe ja sakate hai
 Prima facie It's a knee jerk protectionist move
 Not in sync with India’s global image as emerging destination of capital flows and globalisation of Indian financial products i

 He informed that the council will participate in the state level meeting of democracy fighters held on September 15 in Lucknow
 input:ians Every year the Delhi Traffic Police marks many such places and roads where there is waterlogging in the rain
 trephic police har baar peedblyoody, emsidi or endiemasi jaisi civik agenciyon ko in jagahon ko durast karne ke liye chitthiyaan bhi likhti he
 But the situation remains the same
 aapako bataa den ki 2015 main trephic police ne aise 160 jagahon ko chinhit kiya tha jahaan jalairao kii samasya thi
 In 2016, he got only 58 such places, while in 2017, there was a problem of waterlogging in 90 places
 khaas baat ye he ki trephic police dwaara bataai gai sabhi jagahon main se adhikansh jagah peedblyoody ke hisse kii hai
 Professor Seva Ram, who does road research at Delhi's School of Planning and Architecture, says that waterlogging is not new in Delhi
 har saal saikadon jagahon par jalairao hota he
 Whether it is Delhi's main intersection ITO, the Lutyens zone in front of the High Court or any internal road, the situation is more or less the same everywhere
 jin agenciyon ko ye sudhaar karnaa he unamem aapasi khinchataan bani rahati he
 The clash between the MCD and the Delhi government's PWD is well known
 jaahir he chaahe dilli kii choti sadaken ho yaa phir peedblyoody ke antargat aane vaali badi sadak, samasya har jagah ek si he
 Waterlogging in the slightest rain

 His former supporters of the Gujarat Thakor Army have complained that Alpesh swore that he was a social worker and would never step into politics

 Gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya apparently says in the context of Hardik and Alpesh, "it is not as easy to get hold of vast communities as political pundits feel

 In the last election, the BJP proved this dominance when it won almost every seat in cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot
 baavjood iske use gramin uttar or madhya gujarat main baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 In the 2015 civic elections, even after the emergence of Hardik Patel, the BJP won just seven out of 31 district panchayats and 56 out of 203 taluka panchayats, but retained its dominance in urban areas by winning seven municipal corporations
 
 rajya or rashtriya str par uskaa ek trek record rahaa he
 For example, the proposal to raise the Narmada dam to its full height of 138 meters had been gathering dust for a decade under the UPA government at the Center before Modi became Prime Minister

 In Modi and Hindutva, the Congress, regardless of its anti-incumbency feeling, knows that Modi has achieved mythological status in his home state

 There is a city in Israel named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is emerging as the city of the future
 modi in makkaabim riyut ek aadhunik shahar he, jo rajdhani tel aviv se kareeb 35 kilometre dakshin-purv main madhya isroyal main sthit he
 At the time of Prime Minister Modi's Israeli visit, the embassy chief Farom Ditza also shared a sign board of the city
 The arrival of PM # modiinisraelreflected even on road signs on the way from # Jerusalemto the airport :)pic

 com / t6zxa0jsce— Froim Ditza (@froim)july 4, 2017vahiin modi in shahar kii aadhikarik website ke anusaar yah bhavishya kaa shahar (city of da future) he
 Its foundation stone was laid in 1993
 website par likhaa he, pracheen shahar modi in ke naam par shahar kaa naam rakhaa gaya he, jo hashamenam vansh kaa centre tha
 This dynasty created Israel's rich heritage
 pichley chah saal se bharat main rah rahe rabbi akiva kehete hai, yah ek yuva shahar he jo yuva aabaadi ke saath bahut teji se bad rahaa he'
 He said that he visited Modi in the city a few years before coming to India
 akiva ne kaha, shahar ke namakaran kaa pradhanmantri modi se koi lenadena nahin he, lekin yah dilachasp sanyog he
 Akiva jokingly said that the city name could be an abbreviation of Inn (IN) India
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantrimodi kii isroyal yatrako lekar vahaan ke naagarik bahut khush the, jo kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri kii pehali isroyal yatra thi
 Let us know that PM Modi's three-day historic Israel visit ended on Thursday
 vah tel aviv or hypha gaye the
 However, Modi was not a city in his itinerary
 neshnal register of citigens ke draft ke tahat aaye chalis lakh logon kaa 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav par koi asar nahin hoga
 Chief Election Commissioner of the country Om Prakash Rawat seems quite relaxed about this
 unka tark he ki awwal to saare log voter kii sharten puri nahin karte hai
 All will not be above 18 years of age
 hajaaron to bachche bhi honge
 Instructions have been given to the Chief Electoral Officer of Assam to identify those who fulfill the conditions of voter and after getting satisfied with the citizenship documents, their names are recorded in the voter list
 siisi ravat ne kaha ki chaar janvari 2019 ko matadaata suchi kaa prakaashan hona he
 We have a lot of time
 hamane mukhya chunaav adhikari ko nirdesh diye hai ki neshnal register of citigens ke state koordinator se sampark karte rahen
 We have sought a report in a week in coordination with Assam CEO, SENRC
 report main siio tamaam aankade denge ki 40 lakh logon main kitne bachche hai
 How many new voters are of the age who have just crossed the 18-year threshold and how many are middle-aged or elderly
 mahilaon or purushon kaa bhi data hamane talab kiya he
 That is, we will have complete data
 yani samay rahete hamaare aage tasviir saaf ho jaaegi
 As the people of his department will confirm the claims of citizenship of those four million people, the Election Commission will do verification on its behalf and enter their name in the voter list
 ravat ne ye bhi kaha ki ferj kijiye kahin 4 janvari 2019 se tak enarasi apana data collection complit nahin kar paaya to hamaari team apane system se puraa data taiyaar kar legi
 After the attestation of the number of people who have submitted their documents and applications to our ERO ie Electoral Roll Officer's office, we will register them in the voter list
 aakhir hamaara naaraa or sutara vaakya bhi he ki koi voter chhootane naa paye
 Even in making voter list and in voting
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main ravat ne ye bhi kaha ki kaayade se ham enarasi se bandhe nahin hai
 Yes, we will match our data to their data
 isse veriphication main hamen atirikt aasaani hogi
 Even after this, it is possible that many people will get such names which will not be named in NRC
 lekin voter list main hoga
 There will also be many people who will be in NRC but their votes will not be made
 kyonki hamaari team unke daavon se santusht nahin hogi
 Or they do not fulfill the three important conditions of making voters
 ye teen sharten hai ki wo desh kaa naagarik ho
 He must be over 18 years of age
 wo sajayaftaa, pagal yaa diwalia naa ho
 Army vehicles on the streets of Ahmedabad are like an ominous sigh before relief for Gujarat
 2002 ke baad pehali baar ahmedabad kii sadakon par lauti sena kii ye tasviren bataa rahi hai ki 25 agast se lekar 26 agast kii shaam ke bich gujarat kii police ne itnaa kuch ganvaa diya he ki ab maamla usase sanbhalane vaala nahin he
 Delhi too did not delay in sending army and paramilitary forces
 ek maheene se gujarat main reliyon kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he magar sthiti tabhi kyon niyantran se baahar gai jab 25 taarikh kii raily main lakhon kii sankhya aa gai
 At a time when the political control of the BJP is visible in the whole country, Gujarat is a better laboratory for its control, why everything seems to go out of control there
 agar aap yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki hardik patel ke peeche koun he to is sawaal kaa agar thos jawaab hota to ab tak to mil hi gaya hota
 Hardik Patel says that no one is behind him
 unke peeche gaanvon kii garibi or patelon kii berojgaare he
 Had it been answered by speculation, we would have got it
 isliye hardik ke peeche koun he kii jagah philhal yah dekhne kii zarurat he ki hardik ke kaaran jo gujarat hamaare saamne he wo kyon hai, wo kya he
 When our colleague Prasad Kathe, who arrived in Surat from Mumbai, started counting the burnt buses, 14 buses were burnt at the same place
 is pul ke neeche kraine or doodh ke tanker ko phoonk diya gaya
 Even when Prasad Kathe was shooting, smoke was coming out of some vehicles
 raat ko sahame log in jali hui bason ke saath selfi lene aa chuke the
 Curfew was being imposed in the areas of Kapodara, Sarsana police station in Surat, running away between the police and protesters
 isi surat main kuch din pehle patel yuvaaon kii raily main lakhon log aae tab to koi hinsa nahin hui thi
 The population of Patels in Surat is said to be one million
 yahaan ke patel bahul ilaakon main ladke sadakon par nikal aae
 Buses and government buildings were targeted
 joint kamishnar or do sipaahiyon ko bhi chot ai
 Schools in Surat remained closed on Wednesday, and will remain closed on Thursday
 ahmedabad main hamaare sahyogi rajeev pathak or abhishek sharma ne shahar kaa round lenaa shuru kiya
 When both of them reached near the Gujarat Steel Tube Crossing in Ranip area, they saw a crowd of Patels trying to damage the rail tracks
 hamaare sahyogiyon ke liye paas se record karnaa mushkil tha isliye ve nazadik kii imaarat kii chat par ja pahunche
 Soon the police started their action and a situation of confrontation arose
 tabhi police kii nigaah hamaare sahyogiyon par bhi padi to unki taraf bhi shelling shuru kar di
 After this, both of them reached the Matchachaya Society of Bapunagar area
 yah mahila camera dekhte hi rone lageen
 Started telling that the police have killed us a lot as Patel
 parking main khadi sabhi 25 gaadiyaan tod daaleen hai
 Our houses have also been harmed by entering
 bapunagar patel bahul ilaaka he
 You are aware that most of the societies here live in Patel
 chand duusari jati ke log rahete hai magar ve sirf agadi jati ke hote hai
 At some places, Rajiv and Abhishek were told by the police that the Patel society has been targeted by the police
 25 taarikh kii shaam jab jiemdisi maidan se patel naujavaanon kaa hujum laut chukaa tha tab vahaan anshan par baithe saat aath sau ladakon ko bhagane ke liye police ne khadedna shuru kar diya
 The police not only beaten the boys who were on hunger strike, but also left the common people
 media team par bhi lathi charge kiya gaya
 No one knows the decision taken by the police or the political level, but the answer is not so difficult
 hinsa to tab bhi nahin bhadki jab gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne jiemdisi ground jaakar patidaaron kaa gyaapan lene se manaa kar diya or saaf-saaf kaha ki supreme court kii 50 fisadi kii seemaa ke kaaran patelon ko aarakshan dena mumkin nahin he
 Within half an hour of the police action, violence erupted in Patel-dominated areas of Ahmedabad
 ramol, nichol, bapunagar, naranpura, odhav, krishna nagar, ghatlodia main karfu laga diya gaya
 There was a confrontation between the Patels and the police
 bijepi netaa govardhan jadaafia ne bhi kaha ki police bina kisi kasoor ke kai logon ko baapu nagar se uthaa le gai he
 When Hardik Patel announced the Gujarat bandh on Wednesday, the government shut down the Internet and whatsapp
 hamaare raajnneetik dalon ko pataa he ki whatsap ke zariye afvaah failaane kaa kaam kitna asardaar hota he
 Overall, Gujarat remained calm on Wednesday, but two youth died in police firing in Banaskantha
 udhar ahmedabad main mangalvaar shaam hui police karrwai main ghayal paanch naujavaanon kii maut ho gai he
 Prime Minister Modi immediately appealed for peace and said that there is no way out of the violence
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hamen milakar or baatcheet se samaadhaan khojna hi hoga
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat again appealed to maintain peace but security around his residence was increased
 rajya ke grahamantri kaa ghar bhi 25 taarikh kii raat jalaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Hardik Patel has also appealed for peace
 hardik ne police par bhi aarope lagaae hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has not made any statement
 is bich logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal uthne lage hai jiskaa jawaab ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge
 There is a question in the minds of many people that this battle of the Patels is not for reservation but for abolition of reservation itself
 padidaron ne aise bayaan bhi diye hai ki obisi main jagah nahin to aarakshan kii vyavastha hi nahin
 Seeing the crowd of boys at the GMDC ground, youth outside Gujarat started writing against the reservation
 aarakshan virdohi savarna yuvaaon ko laga ki patelon kii raily ke bahaane phir se mauka aayaa he aarakshan ke khilaaf baat karne kaa
 From the Constituent Assembly till date, the arguments of merit and equality against reservation have not changed
 samasya yah he ki aarakshan virdohi noujvaan jin raajnneetik dalon se ummid karte hai, jin netaaon kaa loha maanate hai unamem saahas hi nahin he ki ve aarakshan ke sawaal par nae tareeke se sochane kaa prastaav tak kar saken
 Just by saying that they want to think in a new way, their political existence may be in danger
 lihaaza ye donon dal pandrah bees saalon se apane ghoshnaptr main savarnon ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat to karte hai magar sarkaar main aate hi chup ho jate hai
 Even Gujarat and BJP did not send their spokespersons to discuss the issue of Gujarat
 yah bataata he ki congress or bijepi hameshaa fasebuk or twitor ke coment padhakar raajnneeti nahin karti hai
 Social media reservation opponents may feel that they run these two parties
 duusari taraf in awaazon se dalit or obisi samaaj satark hone laga he
 Gujarat's Dalit is still silent but OBC has started raising voice
 samasya yah he ki patelon ke saath saath kshatriya rajput, brahman or raghuvanshi bhi obisi main shaamil hone ke maang kar rahe hai
 The OBC community has become more apprehensive about their rallies taking place in Gujarat
 tippaniyan On Sunday, Kshatriyas from 60 villages of Vadodara have also decided to hold a rally on September 3 to demand reservation
 - kareeb 5000 kii sankhya main kshatriya rajputon ne godhra main ek raily nikaali or colector ko gyaapan bhi diya he
 - People from Panchmahal, Mahisagar and Dahod gathered in this rally of Kshatriya Rajputs
 - brahman samaaj or raghuvanshi samaaj ne bhi aarakshan kii maang ko lekar saurashtra ke amarelli main raily nikaali
 - Nearly 30,000 people attended this rally and memorandum was given to the collector
 - in reliyon ke jawaab main 23 agast ko ahmedabad main thakor samaaj ne bhi raily kar di
 - Thakor society is also considered economically and politically powerful like Patels
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation
 jo sabase amir mana gaya wo aarakshan maange to sawaal aarakshan ko lekar hona chahie yaa us amiri kii hakeekat ko lekar
 Delhi too did not delay in sending army and paramilitary forces
 ek maheene se gujarat main reliyon kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he magar sthiti tabhi kyon niyantran se baahar gai jab 25 taarikh kii raily main lakhon kii sankhya aa gai

 There is a question in the minds of many people that this battle of the Patels is not for reservation but for abolition of reservation itself

 Seeing the crowd of boys at the GMDC ground, youth outside Gujarat started writing against the reservation

 Gujarat's Dalit is still silent but OBC has started raising voice
 samasya yah he ki patelon ke saath saath kshatriya rajput, brahman or raghuvanshi bhi obisi main shaamil hone ke maang kar rahe hai
 The OBC community has become more apprehensive about their rallies taking place in Gujarat
 tippaniyan On Sunday, Kshatriyas from 60 villages of Vadodara have also decided to hold a rally on September 3 to demand reservation
 - kareeb 5000 kii sankhya main kshatriya rajputon ne godhra main ek raily nikaali or colector ko gyaapan bhi diya he

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation
 jo sabase amir mana gaya wo aarakshan maange to sawaal aarakshan ko lekar hona chahie yaa us amiri kii hakeekat ko lekar
 If you want to know who is behind Hardik Patel, then if there was a concrete answer to this question, it would have been found by now
 hardik patel kehete hai ki unke peeche koi nahin he
 Behind them is the poverty of the villages and unemployment of the Patels
 atakalon se jawaab milanaa hota to mil chukaa hota
 Therefore, instead of who is behind Hardik, at the moment, it is necessary to see why Gujarat is in front of us because of Hardik, what is that
 mumbai se surat pahunche hamaare sahyogi prasad kathe ne jab jali hui bason ko ginana shuru kiya to ek hi jagah par 14 basen jali huin mili
 Cranes and milk tankers were burnt under this bridge
 prasad kathe jab shoot kar rahe the tab bhi kuch vaahanon se dhuaan nikal hi rahaa tha
 At night, people had come to take selfies with these burnt buses
 surat ke kapodara, sarasanaa thana kshetron main karfu laga rahaa, police or pradarshnakariyon ke bich bhaaga bhaagi chalati rahi
 In the same Surat, a few days ago, lakhs of people came to the rally of Patel youth, then there was no violence
 surat main patelon kii aabaadi das lakh bataai jaati he
 Boys came out on the streets in Patel-dominated areas here
 bason or sarkari imaaraton ko nishaanaa banane lage
 The Joint Commissioner and two soldiers were also injured
 surat ke skool buudhvaar ko bhi band rahe, guuruuvaar ko bhi band rahenge
 Our associates in Ahmedabad, Rajeev Pathak and Abhishek Sharma started taking the city round
 donon jab ranip ilaake kii gujarat steel tub crossing ke paas pahunche to vahaan dekha ki patelon kii bheed railgadee ko roak patari ko nuksaan pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 It was difficult for our colleagues to record close by so they reached the roof of a nearby building
 jaldi hi police ne apni karrwai shuru kar di or takaraav kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 At that time, the police got an eye on our colleagues, then started shelling towards them too
 iske baad donon pahunche bapunagar ilaake kii maatruchhaaya sosayadi main
 This woman started crying on seeing the camera
 bataane lagi ki police ne hamen patel samaj kar khub maaraa he
 All 25 vehicles parked in the parking lot have been broken
 hamaare gharon main bhi ghus kar nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 Bapunagar is a Patel-dominated area
 aap jaanate hi hai ki yahaan ki socytiyon main zyaadaatar patel hi rahete hai
 a few other castes live, but they belong only to the upper caste
 rajeev or abhishek ko kuch jagahon par logon ne bataaya ki patelon kii sosayadi ko police ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 On the evening of the 25th, when Patel returned from the GMDC grounds, the police started chasing away seven hundred and eight hundred boys on fast
 police ne anshan par baithe ladakon ko to peeta hi, aam logon ko bhi nahin choda
 The media team was also charged with lathi
 police kii karrwai kaa faisla sarkaar yaa raajnneetik str par liya gaya yah koi nahin jaanata par jawaab itnaa bhi mushkil nahin he
 The violence did not erupt even when the Gujarat Chief Minister refused to go to the GMDC ground and take a memorandum from the Patidars and stated clearly that it was not possible to give reservation to the Patels due to the Supreme Court's 50 per cent cap
 police kii karrwai hote hi aadhe ghante ke bheetar ahmedabad ke patel bahul ilaakon main hinsa bhadak gai
 Curfew was imposed in Ramol, Nicole, Bapunagar, Naranpura, Odhav, Krishna Nagar, Ghatlodia
 patelon or police ke bich takaraav hone laga
 BJP leader Govardhan Zadaphia also said that the police have taken many people from Bapu Nagar without any fault
 hardik patel ne buudhvaar ko gujarat band kaa elaan kiya to sarkaar ne internet or whatsap band kar diye
 Our political parties know how effective the spread of rumor is through whatsapp
 kulamilaakar buudhvaar ko gujarat shant to rahaa lekin banaaskantha main police kii firing main do naujavaanon kii maut ho gai
 Meanwhile, five youth injured in the police action in Ahmedabad on Tuesday evening have died
 pradhanmantri modi ne turant shanti kii apil kii or kaha ki hinsa se koi rasta nahin nikalataa he
 The Prime Minister said that we will have to find solutions by working together and negotiating
 gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne phir se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii lekin unke nivas ke aas paas suraksha badha di gai
 An attempt was also made to burn the home of the state Home Minister on the 25th night
 hardik patel ne bhi shanti kii apil kii he
 Hardik has also accused the police
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne koi bayaan nahin diya he
 In the meantime, many types of questions have arisen in the minds of people, to which we will try to find the answer
 kai logon ke man main sawaal he ki patelon kii yah ladaai aarakshan ke liye nahin he balki aarakshan ko hi khatm karne ke liye he
 The peddlers have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally
 samvidhan sabha se lekar aaj tak aarakshan ke khilaaf di jane vaali merit or barabari kii daleelein nahin badali hai
 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation
 sirf itnaa kehane se ki ve nae tareeke se sochna chaahate hai unka raajnneetik vajood khatare main pad saktaa he
 So both these parties in their manifesto for fifteen to twenty years talk about reservation for upper castes on economic basis but they become silent as soon as they come in the government
 yahaan tak ki gujarat ke masale par baat karne ke liye gujarat or bijepi ne apane pravaktaa tak nahin bheje
 It states that Congress and BJP do not always do politics by reading the comments of Facebook and Twitter
 soshal media ke aarakshan virodhiyon ko bhale lagata ho ki ve in do dalon ko chalaate hai
 On the other hand, the Dalit and OBC society is becoming cautious with these voices
 gujarat kaa dalit to abhi chup he magar obisi ne awaz uthaani shuru kar di he
 The problem is that along with the Patels, the Kshatriya Rajputs, Brahmins and Raghuvanshis are also demanding to join the obcs
 gujarat main jagah-jagah par ho rahi inaki reliyon se bhi obisi samudaay zyada ashankit hua he
 The comments - ravivaar ko vadodara ke 60 gaanvon se aae kshatriyon ne bhi aarakshan kii maang ko lekar teen sitambar ke din raily karne kaa faisla kiya he
 - Around 5000 Kshatriya Rajputs took out a rally in Godhra and have also submitted a memorandum to the Collector
 - kshatriya rajputon kii is raily main panchmahal, mahisagar or dahod se log jamaa hue the
 - Brahmin Samaj and Raghuvanshi Samaj also took out a rally in Amreli, Saurashtra to demand for reservation
 - is raily main 30,000 ke kareeb log shaamil hue or colector ko gyaapan diya gaya
 In response to these rallies, Thakor Samaj also rallied in Ahmedabad on 23 August
 - thakor samaaj bhi patelon kii tarah aarthik or raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee mana jaataa he
 Is it not that reservation has become a popular and effective model, if there is or was a development model in Gujarat, then there should be the most opportunities for merit and equality
 vahaan ke noujvaan aarakshan ke liye kyon majaboor hue
 Well, the Patel community hoisted the flag of their economic success in Gujarat and abroad and got political power in return
 ab vahi samaaj aarakshan kii baat kar rahaa he
 If the person who is considered the richest asks for reservation, then the question should be about reservation or the reality of that richness

 ahmedabad main hamaare sahyogi rajeev pathak or abhishek sharma ne shahar kaa round lenaa shuru kiya

 hamaare sahyogiyon ke liye paas se record karnaa mushkil tha isliye ve nazadik kii imaarat kii chat par ja pahunche
 Soon the police started their action and a situation of confrontation arose
 tabhi police kii nigaah hamaare sahyogiyon par bhi padi to unki taraf bhi shelling shuru kar di
 After this, both of them reached the Matchachaya Society of Bapunagar area
 yah mahila camera dekhte hi rone lageen

 Our houses have also been harmed by entering
 bapunagar patel bahul ilaaka he
 You are aware that most of the societies here live in Patel
 chand duusari jati ke log rahete hai magar ve sirf agadi jati ke hote hai
 At some places, Rajiv and Abhishek were told by the police that the Patel society has been targeted by the police
 25 taarikh kii shaam jab jiemdisi maidan se patel naujavaanon kaa hujum laut chukaa tha tab vahaan anshan par baithe saat aath sau ladakon ko bhagane ke liye police ne khadedna shuru kar diya
 The police not only beaten the boys who were on hunger strike, but also left the common people
 media team par bhi lathi charge kiya gaya
 No one knows the decision taken by the police or the political level, but the answer is not so difficult
 hinsa to tab bhi nahin bhadki jab gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne jiemdisi ground jaakar patidaaron kaa gyaapan lene se manaa kar diya or saaf-saaf kaha ki supreme court kii 50 fisadi kii seemaa ke kaaran patelon ko aarakshan dena mumkin nahin he

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aarakshan ek lokapriy or kargar model ho gaya he, agar gujarat main koi vikaas kaa model he yaa tha to vahaan merit or barabari ke liye sabase adhik maukey hone chahie
 Why were the youth there forced to make reservations
 thik he patel samudaay ne gujarat or videshon main apni aarthik kamyaabi ke jhande gaade or badale main raajnneetik takat bhi mili
 Now the same society is talking about reservation
 jo sabase amir mana gaya wo aarakshan maange to sawaal aarakshan ko lekar hona chahie yaa us amiri kii hakeekat ko lekar
 The police not only beaten the boys who were on hunger strike, but also left the common people
 media team par bhi lathi charge kiya gaya
 No one knows the decision taken by the police or the political level, but the answer is not so difficult
 hinsa to tab bhi nahin bhadki jab gujarat kii mukhyamantri ne jiemdisi ground jaakar patidaaron kaa gyaapan lene se manaa kar diya or saaf-saaf kaha ki supreme court kii 50 fisadi kii seemaa ke kaaran patelon ko aarakshan dena mumkin nahin he
 Within half an hour of the police action, violence erupted in Patel-dominated areas of Ahmedabad
 ramol, nichol, bapunagar, naranpura, odhav, krishna nagar, ghatlodia main karfu laga diya gaya
 There was a confrontation between the Patels and the police
 bijepi netaa govardhan jadaafia ne bhi kaha ki police bina kisi kasoor ke kai logon ko baapu nagar se uthaa le gai he
 When Hardik Patel announced the Gujarat bandh on Wednesday, the government shut down the Internet and whatsapp
 hamaare raajnneetik dalon ko pataa he ki whatsap ke zariye afvaah failaane kaa kaam kitna asardaar hota he
 Overall, Gujarat remained calm on Wednesday, but two youth died in police firing in Banaskantha
 udhar ahmedabad main mangalvaar shaam hui police karrwai main ghayal paanch naujavaanon kii maut ho gai he
 Prime Minister Modi immediately appealed for peace and said that there is no way out of the violence
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hamen milakar or baatcheet se samaadhaan khojna hi hoga
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat again appealed to maintain peace but security around his residence was increased
 rajya ke grahamantri kaa ghar bhi 25 taarikh kii raat jalaane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Hardik Patel has also appealed for peace
 hardik ne police par bhi aarope lagaae hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has not made any statement
 is bich logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal uthne lage hai jiskaa jawaab ham jaanane kaa prayaas karenge
 There is a question in the minds of many people that this battle of the Patels is not for reservation but for abolition of reservation itself
 padidaron ne aise bayaan bhi diye hai ki obisi main jagah nahin to aarakshan kii vyavastha hi nahin
 Seeing the crowd of boys at the GMDC ground, youth outside Gujarat started writing against the reservation
 aarakshan virdohi savarna yuvaaon ko laga ki patelon kii raily ke bahaane phir se mauka aayaa he aarakshan ke khilaaf baat karne kaa
 From the Constituent Assembly till date, the arguments of merit and equality against reservation have not changed
 samasya yah he ki aarakshan virdohi noujvaan jin raajnneetik dalon se ummid karte hai, jin netaaon kaa loha maanate hai unamem saahas hi nahin he ki ve aarakshan ke sawaal par nae tareeke se sochane kaa prastaav tak kar saken
 Just by saying that they want to think in a new way, their political existence may be in danger
 lihaaza ye donon dal pandrah bees saalon se apane ghoshnaptr main savarnon ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii baat to karte hai magar sarkaar main aate hi chup ho jate hai
 Even Gujarat and BJP did not send their spokespersons to discuss the issue of Gujarat
 yah bataata he ki congress or bijepi hameshaa fasebuk or twitor ke coment padhakar raajnneeti nahin karti hai
 Social media reservation opponents may feel that they run these two parties
 duusari taraf in awaazon se dalit or obisi samaaj satark hone laga he
 Gujarat's Dalit is still silent but OBC has started raising voice
 samasya yah he ki patelon ke saath saath kshatriya rajput, brahman or raghuvanshi bhi obisi main shaamil hone ke maang kar rahe hai
 The OBC community has become more apprehensive about their rallies taking place in Gujarat

 Now the same society is talking about reservation
 jo sabase amir mana gaya wo aarakshan maange to sawaal aarakshan ko lekar hona chahie yaa us amiri kii hakeekat ko lekar
 In the meantime, many types of questions have arisen in the minds of people, to which we will try to find the answer
 kai logon ke man main sawaal he ki patelon kii yah ladaai aarakshan ke liye nahin he balki aarakshan ko hi khatm karne ke liye he
 The officials have also given such statements that there is no place for reservation in the obcs
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage
 Anti-reservation upper caste youth felt that the opportunity has come again to talk against reservation on the pretext of Patel's rally
 samvidhan sabha se lekar aaj tak aarakshan ke khilaaf di jane vaali merit or barabari kii daleelein nahin badali hai
 The problem is that the political parties from which the anti-reservation youth expect, the leaders whom they believe do not have the courage to even propose to think in a new way on the question of reservation
 sirf itnaa kehane se ki ve nae tareeke se sochna chaahate hai unka raajnneetik vajood khatare main pad saktaa he
 So both these parties in their manifesto for fifteen to twenty years talk about reservation for upper castes on economic basis but they become silent as soon as they come in the government
 yahaan tak ki gujarat ke masale par baat karne ke liye gujarat or bijepi ne apane pravaktaa tak nahin bheje
 It states that Congress and BJP do not always do politics by reading the comments of Facebook and Twitter
 soshal media ke aarakshan virodhiyon ko bhale lagata ho ki ve in do dalon ko chalaate hai
 On the other hand, the Dalit and OBC society is becoming cautious with these voices
 gujarat kaa dalit to abhi chup he magar obisi ne awaz uthaani shuru kar di he
 The problem is that along with the Patels, the Kshatriya Rajputs, Brahmins and Raghuvanshis are also demanding to join the obcs
 gujarat main jagah-jagah par ho rahi inaki reliyon se bhi obisi samudaay zyada ashankit hua he
 The comments - ravivaar ko vadodara ke 60 gaanvon se aae kshatriyon ne bhi aarakshan kii maang ko lekar teen sitambar ke din raily karne kaa faisla kiya he
 - Around 5000 Kshatriya Rajputs took out a rally in Godhra and have also submitted a memorandum to the Collector
 - kshatriya rajputon kii is raily main panchmahal, mahisagar or dahod se log jamaa hue the
 - Brahmin Samaj and Raghuvanshi Samaj also took out a rally in Amreli, Saurashtra to demand for reservation
 - is raily main 30,000 ke kareeb log shaamil hue or colector ko gyaapan diya gaya
 In response to these rallies, Thakor Samaj also rallied in Ahmedabad on 23 August
 - thakor samaaj bhi patelon kii tarah aarthik or raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee mana jaataa he
 Is it not that reservation has become a popular and effective model, if there is or was a development model in Gujarat, then there should be the most opportunities for merit and equality
 vahaan ke noujvaan aarakshan ke liye kyon majaboor hue
 Well, the Patel community hoisted the flag of their economic success in Gujarat and abroad and got political power in return
 ab vahi samaaj aarakshan kii baat kar rahaa he
 If the person who is considered the richest asks for reservation, then the question should be about reservation or the reality of that richness
 jiemdisi maidan main ladakon kii bheed ko dekhte hue soshal media main gujarat ke baahar ke noujvaan aarakshan ke khilaaf likhane bolne lage

 bhale hi aap mujhe na dekhen lekin tivi kam dekhie
 Many people are now making fun of those channels on social media
 ek to pehle shridevi kii dukhad maut hui uske baad har channel ne shridevi ko apane apane hisaab se maaraa or use dekhne vaale har darshak ne latifa banaakar apane apane hisaab se maaraa
 You must have understood that TV has the power to eliminate your sensitivity
 koi pehla mauka to nahin he, is tarah se news channel hazaar baar kar chuke hai or aage bhi karte rahenge
 But one question you ask yourself, have you really decided that you and your society should be destroyed
 agar aapane tay kar liya he to phir aapako yah jaanakar khushi honi chahie ki kai rajyon main aapke bacchon ke padhane ke liye dhang kaa ek college tak nahin he
 Those colleges do not have teachers and those who are teaching on contract are being given twelve thousand rupees
 agar aap mata pita hai to apane bacchon ko kahie ki hamane tumhaari barbaadi kaa intazaam kar diya he chalo milakar tivi dekhte hai
 If you think I'm not right then ndtv
 in par jaakar uniwarsity series ke sabhi 27 ank dekh jaaiye or phir apane bachche ko dikhaaiye ki ham tumhen is college main barbaad hote dekhnaa chaahate hai, lekin abhi chalo tivi dekhte hai
 Let's see the bathtub of death
 aalochana ke baad bhi channelon kii nirlajjataa par koi asar nahin padaa
 Will not have to do any further kya isamen aapaki sahmati nahin he, ye jaanane ke liye aap fasebuk or whats ap ke massej check kiijie ki aap kya pard rahe hai, kya likh rahe hai or kya share or like kar rahe hai
 These channels will get the best channel award for a few days, an anchor will be the winner and then all will be well with the congratulatory messages
 tivi kam dekhie
 On this, there is either propaganda of lies, the leader's leadership is going on, a Hindu Muslim debate is run to convert you or your child into a human bomb
 26 farvari ko hamane prime time kii series main kuch bainkon ke shauchalay kaa haal dikhaaya tha
 The effect has been that Allahabad Bank, State Bank of India, Syndicate Bank and Indian Bank have come into action
 in sabane circular bhejkar mahilaon ke liye har branch main sau fisadi shauchalay kii vyavastha karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The lines running on your screen are the same circular
 patna ke pant bhawan main indian bank kii shakha main shauchalay kii vyavastha ko lekar khub meeting hui
 Allahabad Bank also mentioned its circular dated January 9, but did not say what happened during these circulars in a month
 elahabaad bank kaa circular kahata he ki purush or mahila donon ke liye shauchalay or pine ke pani kii uttam vyavastha honi chahie
 The message of the State Bank of India states that enditivi mahila karmchaariyon ke shauchalay kii suvidha par survey kar rahaa he, magar halke se chetavanee de di gai he ki chhavi ko nuksaan na pahunche yani banker mujhe kuch na bataaen
 now it's too late
 mujh tak bahut sari jaankariyaan pahunch chuki hai
 We have also seen many messages in which officers above the regional head talk to the branch manager in abusive language
 wo aisa karnaa jaldi band kar den varanaa un gaaliyon ko tivi par dikhaa duungaa
 How much do banks spend on their advertising? teen teen saal tak swatchta kaa binar taange rahe, tab unhone har shakha main mahilaon yaa purushon ke liye alag alag badhiya shauchalay kyon nahin banaaya
 Well now when it is made, the banks should inaugurate the prime time audience, as they are the viewers who were watching the series on the banks of a Zero TRP anchor, leaving the gimmick of channels on the tragic death of Sridevi
 aap sabhi darshakon ko aadhi badhai
 Full congratulations when the toilets are built
 neerav modi se ginen to bank series kaa yah 9waan ank he vaise bainke ke bheetar jo durdasha he uske hisaab se yah chatha ank hona chahie
 You should not lose heart by seeing this toilet, just increase the will power to control the stomach
 yah punjab ke kisi bank ke kisi shauchayal kaa he
 Promise to the sender that if i do not tell the name, i am playing
 darvaaze main kundi nahin he isliye baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 Female employees are not presently, but this toilet has to be used when it comes for investigation or with cash
 baahar koi khadaa rahata he
 You should also focus on why you have placed a chair next to the commode
 zarur kuch gir rahaa hoga, jise rokane ke liye kursi tikaa di gai hogi
 Think that when this chair has come here, what would have been kept where it was
 shaayad yaheen kii kursi toilet main rakhi he tabhi yahaan khatiya rakh di gai he
 Work is done by sitting on a cot
 is tarah se khaanaa garam karne kii mashin rakhi hui he
 Your banker is working in these circumstances
 is duusari tasviir ko dekhie
 Once there used to be a toilet, if there is no space, files have been kept
 badi sankhya main bank kii shakhaon se graahakon, reportron or peedit paksh ne feedback bhej die hai
 This feedback is the golden egg for any government
 chaahe to thik kar do din main vaahvahee lut sakati he
 If this happens, then i will not have to do this series till July
 is tarah se lagaataar to nahin magar bich bich main karata rahoonga
 The big officers of banks are smart
 jab shauchalay kii haalat dikhaai tab unhen hosh aayaa
 When i said that i will do this series till Diwali, many banks have started taking news of their branch
 yah himachal pradesh ke ek gramin bank ke shauchalay kaa haal he
 By seeing its picture, you will get to know how banks take care of their employees
 yah video kanpur ke punjab neshnal bank kii shyaam nagar shakha kaa he
 There is only one toilet outside the bank

 purush or stri donon ke liye ek hi shauchalay he
 i am not interested in reason and excuses, i am interested in showing what i have
 kend sarkaar kii mahilaon ko 180 din kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he
 Together mothers can take child care leave for up to two years
 yaa to ek saath le sakati hai yaa phir 18 saal hone tak tukdon-tukdon main
 Can take that two-year leave
 magar usee kend sarkaar se niyantrit sarkari bainkon main mahilaon ko maatrutiv avkaash maatr 6 maheene kaa miltaa he
 Why is there such a difference? kya chairman sahab log ek din main mahila bankeron kaa maatrutiv avkaash ken sarkaar main kaam karne vaali mahilaon ke baraabar nahin kar sakate hai
 How is this difference so far
 hamaare enditivi main to ham purushon ko 15 din kaa pitrutv avkaash miltaa he
 The condition of male officers is also bad
 jo sheersh ke do pratishat adhikari hai rizanal head tip unki kaaphi mouj he, magar neeche ke manageron ko raat ke nau nau baje tak bank main rukna padataa he
 After all, how does someone like banking work from ten in the morning to ten in the night
