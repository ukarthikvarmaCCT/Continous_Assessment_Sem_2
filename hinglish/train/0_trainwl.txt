 The 70-year-old Ramdulari, who lives in a dilapidated house in Cajiana Mohalla, adjacent to the high security "yellow Zone" on the south side of the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi complex in Ayodhya, has his eyes blurred
 beemaari ke kaaran baayan haath kaam nahin karata
 But the fight that her husband Shyamlal left unfinished seven years ago has continued that fight

 Not only Ramdulari, Ramanand Maurya of this locality and all 23 families, including Rajitram, Ramjeet, Ranjit, Tasadum Hussain, Ansar Hussain, whose valuable ancestral land has been acquired for the campus, residing in the western side Vashistha Kund from the Ram Janmabhoomi acquired premises
 They have been fighting a war of compensation for over a decade
 lekin yah antaheen silsilaa khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 Several times during the last year and a half, the court-ii of the Additional District and Sessions Judge of Faizabad ordered to present the original documents related to the acquisition of Ram Janmabhoomi from the land teaching office of the district

 court ke aadesh ko karyaalay pahunchane ke dedh maheene baad 27 november ko india today ne bhoomi adhyapti adhikari shreebasanta se dastavej na bhejne ke babat poocha to unka jawaab tha, ‘‘main pichley ek saal se faijabad main tainaat hum

 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ke duusare moon mishan Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching takneekee kaarnon se roak di gai he
 56 from launch
 24 minute pehle chandrayan-2 kaa countdown roak diya gaya
 2 in the morning of 15 July
 51 baje chandrayan-2 ko desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya janaa tha
 According to isro's trusted sources, when the countdown was stopped, it seems that the launch vehicle connecting the cryogenic engine and Chandrayaan-2 was not creating the right pressure for launch
 isliye launch ko taal diya gaya
 After stopping the launch, ISRO scientists are trying to find out where this technical flaw came from before the launch
 isro ke vaigyanik puraa prayaas kar rahe hai ki chaar dinon ke andar chandrayan-2 ko launch kar diya jaae nahin to yah teen maheenon ke liye tal jaaegi
 The moon is far away
 
 
 antim samay main Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching taalane ke peeche ye he karantakneekee khami launch whical main thi, jieselvi-emke3 rocket yaa chandrayan main nahiisro ke vishwast sutara ne bataaya ki khami rocket yaa chandrayan-2 main nahin he
 The drawback came in the launch vehicle connecting gslv-mk3's cryogenic engine and Chandrayaan-2
 praathmik jaanch main launch whical main pressure li kii kami dekhi gai
 So now all the parts of the rocket will be tested separately
 chandrayan-2 abhi jis haalat main he, use usee sthiti main surakshit rakhaa jayega
 It would take a long time to disassemble and test the rocket
 wo 11 bade maukey jab ISRO ne apni takat se puri duniya ko hairaan kar diyaaiye
 
 
 Know what kind of investigation process ISRO will undergo after stopping the launching
 sabase pehle rocket se eendhan khaali kiya jayegisero vaigyanik ab sabase pehle jieselvi rocket ke sabhi charnon se eendhan nikaalane kii prakiya shuru karenge
 This is called defueling
 yah prakriya jatil or khatarnaak hoti he, lekin isro vaigyanik ise pehle bhi kar chuke hai
 Therefore, there will be no problem
 isamen boosters, pehla stage, doosraa stage or cryogenic ingine sabhi shaamil hai
 Fuel filled in all these will be extracted
 isamen sabase zyada mahatvapurn cryogenic ingine se nikaala jane vaala liquid oxigen or hydrogen he
 Because they have to be kept at minus 156 degrees Celsius
 chunki, rocket khule aasmaan ke neeche hota he, taapmaana kam-zyada hota rahata he, isliye aise jvalansheel eendhan ko jald hi khaali kiya jayega
 2
 rocket ko chandrayan-2 se alag kiya jayegaindhan nikaalane ke baad sabase pehle jieselvi-emke3 rocket ko chandrayan-2 se alag kiya jayega
 This process is called rocket decking
 taaki puure moon mishan kii kaayade se jaanch kii ja sake
 Will there be a human settlement on the moon? What to expect from Chandrayaan-2 3
 phir banegi analysis cameti, jo takneekee khami khojegichandrayan-2 kii takneekee khami ko jaanchane ke liye isro ke vibhinn centres ke vaigyanikon kii ek analysis team banaai jaaegi
 This team will test the entire GSLV rocket and launch vehicle
 computer ne jab launch kii prakriya roki, us samay se thik pehle se tay automated launch shedul ko dekha jayega
 Then there will be a physical investigation of that flaw
 use sudhara jayega
 After this, all the necessary tests related to rocket, launch vehicle and Chandrayaan-2 will be done back again
 4
 The next date will be announced back, the rocket and Chandrayaan-2 will be assembled, after doing all the necessary tests, the next launching date will be announced
 iske baad, isro vaigyanik jieselvi-emke3 rocket or chandrayan-2 kii dobaaraa essembling karenge
 a relaunch schedule will be inserted into the computer
 taaki dobaaraa launch se pehle lonching kaa puraa system computer ke paas aa jayega
 a countdown of 20 to 24 hours or more will be resumed
 countdown shuru hone ke baad computer phir se puure otemeted launch shedul kii prakriya kii jaanch karegaa
 If everything goes well then it will be launched otherwise it can be stopped again
 sarhad ke sipaahi se khet ke kisaan tak, kaise sabake liye madadgaar he isroaktubara main ho sakati he chandrayan-2 kii lonchingjieselvi-emke3 ko alag-alag karke jaanch karne or usamen ai takneekee khami ko sudhaarney main kaaphi samay lagegaa
 If scientists are not able to launch within four days even after trying their best, then launching Chandrayaan is not possible in the next few weeks
 aglaa launch windo oktober main aayega
 The launch window is the appropriate time when the moon's distance from the Earth is short and the probability of hitting satellites orbiting around the Earth is extremely low
 Chandrayaan-2, jaane-kyon or kitna ahm he ISRO kaa ye mishoctober main kyon kii jaaegi moon mishan kii lonchinglaunch windo kaa faisla isro ke trivendrum sthit spes physics lab karegaa
 The next launch window can be between 10 October to 26 October
 kyonki is dauraan prithvi se chand kii duuri ausat 3
 It is 61 lakh km
 agar 15 july ko chandrayan-2 kii lonching safal rahati to use kareeb 3
 Had to travel 84 lakh km
 yani kareeb 23 hajaar kimi zyada duuri tay kerani padati

 The trend of declining crude oil prices in the international market started in 2014 when crude oil was at $ 114 per barrel in the international market and petrol was being sold at Rs 72 a liter in Delhi, the country's capital
 2014 se shuru hui yah giravat 2015 main jari rahi or phir 2016 aate hi kachche tel kii giravat ne sabhi record tod die
 While crude oil was at $ 48 per barrel in January 2015, by January 2016, it reached below $ 30
 mana jane laga ki vah din dur nahin jab kaccha tel ek bottle mineral water se sasta ho jayega or keemten tut kar 20 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch jaaengi
 In January 2016, petrol was being sold in Delhi at Rs 60 per liter
 ab ek baar phir kaccha tejantararashtriya bazarmen majbootee kaa rukh dikhaa rahaa he
 Crude oil has currently reached above $ 55 per barrel, recovering for the past several weeks
 bazaar ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki tel utpaadan karne vaale deshon main kuch sahmati banane ke asaar dikhaai de rahen hai, lihaaja aane vaale dinon main keemton main or bhi majbootee hi dekhne ko milegi
 Due to this, currently, petrol is being sold in Delhi at Rs 67-68 per liter
 saal 2016 khatm hote-hote kaccha tel utpaadak deshon ke sanghathan OPEC ne agle maheene se utpaadan ghataane kaa faisla kiya he
 Due to this, the price of crude in the international market has jumped by 18 percent in 5 days
 mana ja rahaa he ki bharat samet duniyabar ke bade kaccha tel emport karne vaale deshon main saste petrol or dijal kaa daur ab khatm ho gaya he
 So in the first six months of 2017, the price of petrol in the domestic market can reach 80 rupees
 pichley 2 saal se rus, saudi arab or anya crude utpaadak desh lagaataar apana production badha rahe the
 That is why prices were continuously falling
 ab in deshon main aapasi samjhauta ho jane ke baad giravat kaa yah silsilaa ruk chukaa he
 All these countries were trying to strengthen their economy by earning more and more from crude oil amid the global recession

 maharashtra main maratha aarakshan andolan devendra fadanvis kii sarkaar ke gale kii fans ban gaya he
 The demand for Maratha reservation which has arisen in the state ahead of next year's Lok Sabha and Assembly elections has also created trouble for the BJP
 fadanvis sarkaar chaahakar bhi ise amalijama pahanaati he to obisi samudaay kii naaraazgi jahaan uthaani padegi, vahiin bijepi shasit duusare rajyon main bhi is tarah kii maang uth sakati he
 In view of this, the party is completely silent on this matter
 bataa den ki pichley kaaphi samay se maratha samaaj shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main 16 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahaa he
 The state government has recently put out advertisement for reinstatement of 72 thousand posts, in which the Maratha community is agitating on the road to demand reservation for themselves
 andolan kii kaman maratha kranti morcha ne sambhaal rakhi he
 Banners and posters seen in Mumbai have been put up by Maratha Kranti Morcha itself
 inamen saaf taur par likhaa he ki gujarat main bijepi senchuri puri nahin kar pai
 The hint is clear, if the Marathas were not given reservation in Maharashtra, then in the next election, the figure of 50 in the state would not be crossed
 vartmaan main bijepi ke paas rajya kii kul 288 siton main se 122 siten hai
 The warning of the Maratha reservation movement means that if the Fadnavis government does not meet their demands, then there may be voting against BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 rajya main maraathon kii aabaadi 28 se 33 fisadi he
 Maratha votes are considered to be decisive in 20 to 22 seats out of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra and 80 to 85 seats out of 288 assembly seats
 haalanki bijepi is baat ko bakhubi samajhati he ki maratha uske paramparaagat voter nahin hai
 The Marathas' first choice is NCP, followed by Shiv Sena and Congress at number three
 jabaki bijepi kaa mul vot obisi samudaay he
 In such a situation, the Fadnavis government does not want to annoy the OBC community by accepting the demand for Maratha reservation
 kyonki agar marathaon ko aarakshan diya gaya to unhen obisi cote se hi dena padegaa
 obcs constitute 52% of the state's population
 fadanvis sarkaar ke liye mushkil he ki supreme court kii taraf se nirdhaarit pachaas fisadi se alag kaise aarakshan de
 In such a situation, if the government included Marathas in the 27 per cent quota for OBC, then a separate OBC movement would start in the state
 obisi samudaay aarakshan main kisi tarah ke badlaav ke khilaaf he
 In such a situation, the BJP does not see fit to stand fully with the Marathas
 ye bilkul aisi hi sthiti he jaisi gujarat main patel aarakshan kii maang par bijepi kii thi, vahaan bhi patel banaam obisi ke chakkar main bijepi funs gai thi
 Significantly, the previous Congress government in Maharashtra passed the bill relating to reservation to Marathas in the Vidhan Sabha, but it was stayed by the court
 court ne pichhada varg ayog se maratha samaaj kii aarthik or saamaajik sthiti par report maangi thi
 Last year too, the Maratha community took to the road for agitation demanding reservation
 iske baad mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne sidhe taur par aarakshan kii maang ko to nahin mana, lekin us disha main aage badhane ko lekar ahm kadam uthaane kii baat kahi thi
 CM Fadnavis said in the Assembly that the demand for Maratha reservation has been referred to the Backward Classes Commission, which will study the basis and prospects of giving reservation to Marathas
 haalanki abhi tak kamishan ne apni report nahin saunpi he
 NCP and Congress are openly with the Marathas to demand reservation

 i later thought that i should not have used Dawood's name
 unhone kaha lekin sabir ali ko bijepi main shaamil kiye jane ko lekar meraa virodh ab bhi jari he
 There has been an uproar within this party after JDU expelled leader Sabir Ali joined the BJP
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne to sabir ali ke shaamil hone kaa kadaa virodh jataate hue kataaksh kiya tha ki ab daaud bhi jald hi bijepi jwine kar saktaa he
 BJP leader Balbir Punj is also unhappy with Sabir Ali joining the party, although former party president Nitin Gadkari says that it is necessary for everyone to come together to defeat the Congress
 unhone sabir ali kaa bijepi main swaagat kiya he
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's displeasure over the issue of Sabir can be gauged from the fact that he openly vented his anger on Twitter

 Earlier, praising bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Sabir Ali said, "modi can improve the country by giving it the right direction
" maine mahasoos kiya ki modi ke bare main pehle main jo sochataa tha, vah galat tha
 This is the reason why i joined BJP
 ' sabir ne bijepi ke mishan ko aage rakhte hue kaha ki ve bhrashtachar va mahangaai ke khilaaf ladaai ke liye is party main shaamil ho rahe hai
 Sabir Ali hit the JDU in a press conference, saying, "when i saw the difference between his words and his actions, i decided to change the party
" 'sabir ali ne bihar siem nitish kumaar par talkh tippanee karte hue kaha, 'nitish kehete hai ki piem pad ke liye vahi sabase yogya ummidavaar hai
 His ego is revealed by his talk
 'gauratlab he ki narendra modi kii tarif kiye jane par jediu ne unhen chand dinon pehle hi party se nikaal diya tha

 Here, people waving arms in their hands have put handcuffs in the hands of the administration
 haal hi main kaalichak kii ghatana se puraa desh sann he lekin yahaan ke halaat kii gaharaai sirf prashasan kii jaanati he
 It would not be wrong to say that this region has become Afghanistan of India
 jahaan fal rahe drug or hathiyaaron kaa vyapaar nipraadh ko had se zyada panaahade di he
 Raj Kanojia, director of the Intelligence Branch of West Bengal, said, "it is true that this area is the main center of illegal drug trade and fake note-making racket because of its presence on the international border
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'khaastaur par kaalichak hinsa ke baad jila prashasan is maamle par najar rakh rahaa he
 The administration has taken appropriate action on this and it will double after the police investigation
 'niojit thi kaalichak hinsasthaneey adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki 3 janvari ko hui kaalichak hinsa akhil bharat hindu mahasabha netaa kamalesh tiwari kii aapattijanak tippanee ke khilaaf pradarshan ke bahaane ek dharm vishesh dwaara jaan-boojhkar kii gai ghatana thi
 Around 35 vehicles were set ablaze, government properties were also damaged and Kalichak police station was set on fire
 police se badla lene kii koshikapana naam na bataane kii shart par ek police adhikari ne kaha, 'puri hinsa, sthaneey prashasan ko aatankit karne ke liye kii gai thi, taaki police se badla liya ja sake or police stesan main rakhe ahm sabooton ko nasht kiya ja sake
 'it is thriving that illegal businesses like Gopalganj, Kalichak, Mohabbatpur, Mothabari and Danga are the main centers of anti-national activities and the biggest hand behind this is the growing trade in drugs
 chaahe baad nakli noton kii ho, avaidh pravaasana kii ho yaa drug or hathiyaaron kii supplai kii ho, malda iskaa hub ban rahaa he

 Due to pollution in a metropolis like Delhi during the cold season, people have little access to natural vitamin-d from the sun's rays
 aise main logon ke sharir main vitamin-di kii kami hona laazmi he
 Numerous researches have been conducted on the proper time to sunbathe during the day and to maintain adequate levels of vitamin-d
 aamtaur par kaha jaataa he ki sharir kaa 20 pratishat hissaa yani bina dhakaa haath or pairon se pratidin 15 minute dhoop kaa seven karne se vitamin-di acchhee maatra main liya ja saktaa he
 The next question is which time of the day is most suitable for exposure to sunlight
 san-block kriim lagane se bachenam dharna ke anusaar, subah kaa dhoop or der shaam kaa 'san bath' sharir ke liye upyukt hota he
 Whereas the truth is that between 10 to 3 in the morning, sun bath between the body gets vitamin-d
 haalanki dhoop ke seven ke dauraan twachaa par san-block kriim yaa loshan nahin lage hone chahie
 In cities like Delhi, where sunlight cannot reach people due to pollution, people can consume vitamin d through dairy products and food
 mahilaon main vishesh rup se pre-menopaujal or post-menopaujal kii shrenee kii mahilaon main osteoporosis or osteomalaysia hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Damage from covering the body completely, women who cover themselves completely and women who apply sun cream also have very low vitamin-d, because sunlight does not penetrate their skin
 vahiin bacchon main vitamin di kii kami se rickets kii samasya hone lagati he
 It is necessary to provide children with adequate diet as well as good sunlight in the beginning
 bacchon ko khaas kar un bacchon ko jinhone maa kaa doodh pinaa chhod diya he, unhen vitamin di se bharpoor khaadya padaarthon kaa seven karana aavashyak he
 At the same time, exercising in good amount helps to keep bones healthy in winter
 kasarat se haddiyon kaa ghanatv bana rahata he, jisase osteoporosis jaisi samasyaon se bachaa ja saktaa he

 The Bihar Board has ordered an inquiry into the results of the students who topped the Intermediate Examination
 somvaar ko 'aaj tak' ne intmediat main top karne vaale chaatro kii asaliyat dikhaai thi ki kis tarah unhen apane vishay kii basic jaankaree bhi nahin he
 After this news, there has been a stir in the education department that despite such monitoring, how did such children get topped
 vahiin vaishali ke vishundev raay college ke purv professor ne kai ahm khulaase kiye hai
 In the presence of the students, the copy will be reproduced again, Ruby Kumari, who topped the investigation Intermediate, does not have knowledge of her subject, saying 'political' sinns as 'product' science or having knowledge about teaching about cooking in political science
 Crisis has started falling on the female student

 During this, his handwriting will also be investigated
 yahi prakriya science main top karne vaale chaatrsaurabh shreshthapar bhi apanaai jaaegi
 The process of copy checking is happening in front of the students because it is feared that someone else has written their copy
 patna main hui thi pehle copy kii jaanchvishundev raay mahavidhyalay main professor ke pad par kaam kar chuke amarendra kumaar singh bataate hai ki is college kii copy, moolyankan kendra se dobaaraa yahaan laai gai thi
 This work cannot happen without the collusion of the board
 professor ke mutabik vaishali jile ke sabhi intermediat skool or college kii copy camoor jile ke moolyakan kendron par bheji gai thi, keval vishundev raay college kii copy patna ke rajendra nagar sthit skool main bheji gai thi
 However, the board argues that in view of the earlier history of this college, it was kept in Patna to keep a special watch on it
 lekin amarendra kumaar singh kaa kahana he ki patna main is college se jude logon ne sab kuch parde ke peeche se apane haq main karvaa liya
 Amrendra Kumar Singh, who was a professor in the same college from 2011 till the establishment of several Rajvishunadev Rai College, opened the former professor of the college, saying that there is no facility of writing in the college, but grading according to money is as much as two numbers
 Get iske liye college main e, bi, si, grad bane hue hai

 pakistan ko vishwa cricket main aisi team mana jaataa he jiske pradarshan main sthirataa nahin he
 On a particular day, it easily defeats the top teams of the world, sometimes it loses to a second-class team
 gendbaaji ke maamle main to is team ko kaaphi acha aanka jaataa he lekin ballebaaji isaki badi kamajori rahi he
 Most of the times in recent matches, due to poor performance of the batsmen, it has suffered defeat
 pakistan team ke do yuva ballebaajon umr akmal or ahamed shahzad ko kaaphi ooncha rate kiya jaataa he lekin anushaasan kii kami or pradarshan main sthirataa kaa abhaav inaki kamajori mana jaataa he
 Due to this, both of them also have to be subjected to criticism from fans
 ek samay in donon ballebaajon kii bharat ke viraat kohli ke saath tulana kii jaati thi lekin aaj viraat har formet main duniya ke sheersh ballebaajon main shumaar hai jabaki umr or shahzad kaa pakistani team main hi andar-baahar hote rahete hai
 By the way, Omar Akmal has slammed people comparing him to Virat Kohli
 unhone kaha ki viraat kohli se meri tulana uchit nahin he kyonki team india ke captain number 3 par batting karte hai
 Omar told Wisden India, 'people compare me to Virat Kohli but it is not good in any way
 yah batting kram kaa maamla he
 From the very beginning of his career, Virat is batting at number 3 while i bat at number 6
 mujhe number 3 par batting karne dijie or kohli ko number 6 par phir hamaari tulana kiijie
 The 26-year-old Pakistani batsman said that the comparison of Kohli and Pakistani batsman Babar Azam can be considered more rational as they both fall on the same batting position (number 3)
 umr ne kaha, 'viraat kii babar ajam se tulana kiijie jo number 3 par lagaataar acha kar rahe hai
 They are good form and you can compare Virat to Babur
 ' gauratlab he ki pakistani wicketiper kamran akmal ke chote bhai umr akmal ne 116 vanade main keval do shatak banaae hai jabaki viraat 179 maichon main 27 shatak jamaa chuke hai
 Virat's record in T20 is much better than Omar
 pakistan kii test team main umr lagaataar andar-baahar hote rahe hai
 He has played only 16 Test matches so far and has scored only one century in it
 vaise, umr akmal ne unki tulana viraat kohli se karne vaale logon ko aade haath liya he
 He said that my comparison with Virat Kohli is not fair because the captain of Team India batting at number 3
 umr ne vijaden india se kaha, 'log meri tulana viraat kohli se karte hai lekin yah kisi tarah se thik nahin nahin he
 It is a matter of batting order
 apane kariyar kii shuruyaat se hi viraat number 3 par batting karte hai jabaki main number 6 par ballebaaji karata hum
 Let me bat at number 3 and compare Kohli to number 6 again
 ' 26 saal ke is pakistani ballebaaj ne kaha ki kohli or pakistani ballebaaj babar ajam kii tulana ko adhik tarksangat mana ja saktaa he kyonki ye donon ek hi batting pojishan (number 3) par aate hai
 Omar said, 'compare Virat to Babar Azam, who is consistently doing well at number 3
 ve achche form hai or aap viraat kii babar se tulana kar sakate hai
 It is worth noting that Omar Akmal, younger brother of Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, has scored only two centuries in 116 odis while Virat has scored 27 centuries in 179 matches
 tii20 main bhi viraat kaa record umr se bahut behatar he
 In Pakistan's test team, Omar has been constantly in and out
 unhone ab tak mahaj 16 test match hi khele hai or isamen keval ek shatak banaaya he

 Today is the 98th death anniversary of mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan
 unka nidhan 26 april 1920 ko hua tha
 Ramanujan was from a very poor family
 unke paas apane shauk puraa karne ke paise nahin the
 It is famous that Ramanujan could make a mathematics question in more than 100 ways
 isi khaasiyat ne unhen duniya main ganit ke guru kaa darja dilaa diya
 Know the special things related to them
 
 
 shrinivas ramanujan kaa bachapan anya bacchon jaisaa saamaanya nahi tha
 He was born on 22 December 1887
 3 saal kii umr tak wo bol nahin paae the, jisaki vajah se mata-pita ko chintaa hone lagi thi ki ramanujan gunge to nahin he
 He was rich in unique talent
 unki pratibha kabhi umr kii mohataaj nahin rahi
 Ramanujan's life lasted only 33 years
 is beemaari se bharat main har saal hoti hai 2 lakh mautanhin lagata tha padhai main manramanujan kii shuruaati padhai tamil bhashaa se hui
 Initially, he did not feel like studying
 par aage jaakar primary pariksha main puure jile main pehla sthaan praapt kiya
 For the first time, he went to higher secondary school for further studies from here, started the study of mathematics
 aisa tha shakespeare kaa jivan, padhein unke 10 anmol vichaar
 
 
 Asked to ask questions, Ramanujan was fond of asking questions since childhood
 or ve kabhi kabhi aisa prashn poochhate the ki shikshakon ke dimag chakra jate the
 Actually, he was very curious to know any question
 kehete hai ki wo apane adhyapakon se aisa sawaal bhi poochhate the ki 'sansar kaa pehla insaan koun tha? akaash or prithvi ke bich kii duuri kitni he? samudr kitna gaharaa or kitna bada he? 
 
 
 
 7veen kaksha main bie ke chaatr ko dete the shikshayah bhi mashhoor he ki saatvin kaksha main padhai karne ke dauraan hi bie ke chaatr ko ganit bhi padhaayaa karte the
 It was only at the age of thirteen that he solved the famous Trigonometry by Loni
 ise hal karne main bade se bade vidwaan bhi asafal ho jate the
 He died at the age of 16

 Carr
 dwaara krit“a Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics”kii 5000 se adhik prameya ko pramanit or siddh karke dikhaaya tha
 Top in Mathematics, Felaramanujan, who was in other subjects, studied so much in Mathematics that he could not pay even a little attention to other subjects
 iskaa nateeja ek baar aisa hua ki 11veen kii pariksha main ganit main to top kar liya jabaki anya sabhi vishyon main fail ho gaye
 Ramanujan's life was spent a lot of struggle after breaking up with his studies
 bhikhaari thakur: ek aam aadmi jisane bhojpuri ko bana diya khaas
 
 
 In the British Raj, Ramanujan had neither a job nor a large degree to get it
 naukari kii talash main unki mulaakaat dipti colector shri ve
 Ramaswamy married Iyer
 ayyar bhi ganit ke bahut bade vidvan the
 He recognized Ramanujan's talent and then arranged a monthly scholarship of 25 rupees for Ramanujan
 baad main ramanujan kaa pratham shodhpatr “barnauli sankhyaon ke kuch gun” shodh patr jarnal of indian mathematical socity main prakashit hua
 a few months later, Ramanujan also got a clerk's job at the Madras Port Trust to keep track of accounts
 ramanujan ko apane ganit prem ke liye samay milane laga
 In this way Ramanujan started writing many new mathematical formulas
 sabase mjedaar baat yah ki shrinivasana ne ganit seekhney ke liye kabhi koi vishesh prashikshan nahin liya tha
 He died on 26 April 1920 at the age of 33

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) a report released by the central government regarding the Chhapra Mid-day meal incident has exposed the claims of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 isamen saaf kaha gaya he ki agar rajya sarkaar sachet hoti to nahin jaati naunihaalon kii jaan
 In this report of the Center it is clearly written that despite the refusal of the children on the day of the incident, they were forced to eat food
 bihar main sushasan kaa dam bharne vaale mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke daawey par report main itane sawaal uthaaye gayi he ki nitish ko jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 Center's Joint Secretary Amarjit Singh in his report has exposed the good governance of Nitish
 report ke mukhya ansh- ghatana ke din bacchon ko badboodaar or kadava khaanaa diya gaya
 - The children had refused to eat food after the first Kaur
 - bacchon ko jabaran daantkar khaanaa khilaayaa gaya
 - Principal Meena Devi bought goods from her husband's shop
 - anivaary hone ke baad bhi minaa devi ne khaanaa test nahin kiya
 The question has been raised in the report that how did it happen that the Principal kept taking the goods from her husband's shop and no government official even raised the question
 jab pehle hi centre ne chetavanee di thi tab bhi sudhaar ke liye koi kadam kyon nahin uthaaya gaya? principal minaa devi kaa gunaah to kanoon tay karegaa lekin nitish sarkaar bhi apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakati
 The report of the Center further states that the local administration and officers did nothing for hours after the incident
 report ke mutabik khaane ke turant baad bachche biimaar hone lage to prisimple bhaag khadi hui
 There was no one to see the sick children
 sarkari afasar haath par haath dhare baithe rahe
 The local dispensary did not even have a doctor
 agar prashasan harakat main aata to bacchon kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 The report clearly states
 ye ghatana saraasar laaparvaahee kaa nateeja he
 The implementation of the scheme has several drawbacks
 bihar main 70 hajaar skool hai lekin 18 hajaar main skool building tak nahin
 Mid-day meal is made in the open and in dirty places
 zyaadaatar jagahon par anaaj rakhane kaa koi intjaam nahin he
 It is clear from the report of the Center that it would not have happened if Nitish government implemented the mid-day meal scheme properly
 or haadase ke baad bhi agar sarkari afasar kuch kadam uthaa lete to keemtee jaane batch sakati thim? People were waiting for the teaser of Salman Khan's upcoming film 'tubelight'

 Today, while Bollywood filmmakers are cashing in on remakes and the practice of making films on someone's life, the famous actress Waheeda Rehman says that she is not in favor of such films
 abhinayta-filmkaar gurudutt or gayak-abhinayta kishor kumaar ke jivan par banane vaali filmon kii khabaron ke bich wahidaa kaa maananaa he ki kisi ke jivan par film bananaa thik nahin he kyonki isse ek kalakaar ke nijee jivan kii bahut si jaankariyaan saamne aa jaati hai
 Waheeda said in an interview, "there were many ups and downs in the lives of Gurudutt and Kishore Kumar
 unke jivan main kaaphi dukh tha
 i think this film can prove to be a tragedy
 yah aisa hoga ki maano ham unki nijee jaankariyaan uplabdh karvaa rahe hai
 i don't think it's a good idea
 ’’ Another trend in Bollywood is to make old popular films in today's style
 aisi filmon main kahani kii mul bhaavana waisi hi rahati he lekin wahidaa iske bhi paksh main nahin hai
 Waheeda said, "I don't believe in remake films
 mujhe lagata he ki mul filmein kuch alag hai or koi bhi mul film jaisi film nahin bana saktaa
 Even if they do, then there will be comparisons between the two, which is not a good idea
 ’’ Due to different types of films being made today, famous actors Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor and many others believe that this is the best time to be in the film industry
 wahidaa is baat par apni sahmati jataati hai
 Waheeda said, "I definitely think this is the best time to be in the film industry
" pehle filmein prem kahani, paariwarik naatak ke tay praaroop par banaai jaati thim
 But today different types of films are being made and are being accepted by the audience

 Waheeda said, "the awards have lost their charm
 aaj kisi bhi cheez ke liye puraskaar baante jate hai
 In our time, hearing the announcement of the winner's name made people chew their nails in panic
 ham hameshaa yah jaanane ke liye utsuk rahete the ki ham vijeta banenge yaa nahin
 That experience of getting the award is completely lost now
 ’’tippaniyan Waheeda remains aware of the films released and the productions given in them due to her association with SAFTA

 Waheeda feels that it is not right to make a film on someone's life as it reveals a lot of personal life of an artist, amid reports of films made on the life of actor-filmmaker Gurudutt and singer-actor Kishore Kumar

 Now it is neither easy nor appropriate to immediately understand such a curved case or catch someone as a thief
 ab yahaan ek or sawaal jo mujhe samaj main aa rahaa he or jo main aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 For example, how can a company named Mossack Fonseca have all its customers
 niyamon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi company banane yaa kareedne main phonseka kii madad letaa he
 The drug mafia also seeks the help of the same company to deposit its black money
 bank luutane vaala giroh bhi paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye phonseka kii madad karata he
 It seems that Fonseca is a ghat where a goat comes to drink water, a deer comes and a tiger
 jahaan magaramchh bhi sustaata rahata he
 Is not the existence of a company like Fonseca a challenge to the world battling terror and various types of corruption
 agar kisi netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa he to phonseka jaisi companiyon ke astitv ko lekar hi bechaini kyon nahin he
 Then these 370 journalists should declare reading one crore documents for a year a useless practice
 par itnaa bekaar hota to bharat sarkaar ne jab ek kanoon banaaya to uske dar se 2000 karod rupaya kaise waapas aa gaya
 i wish i had known that this money came from Panama or from Mokama
 mokama bihar main he or main jis kanoon kii baat kar rahaa hum uskaa sambandh videshon main maujuud sampatti se he
 The Indian Express has published a news report about Syria, which may help to understand this issue
 chah saal se syria main grih yuddh he lekin yah grih yuddh ek tarah se laghu vishwayuddh bhi he kyonki yah apni tarah kaa anokhaa grihayuddh he jisamen rus bhi bam gira rahaa he, america, france, jordan, saudi arab, turki, australia ye sab milakar bam gira rahe hai
 Far from being the solution, the world is facing another new terrorist organization ISIS and it is said that more than two and a half million people have been killed and millions displaced from Syria in this mini world war cum civil war
 aapako yaad ho to november 2015 main rus ke raashtrapati putin ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke paas 40 deshon ke naam hai jinase aatanki sanghathan iesas ko paisa miltaa he
 Putin has also been named in the Panama Papers for allegedly using the help of Mozak Fonseca to hide his money
 ab aap aatank ke khilaaf yuddh ladane ke bhaashanon ko yaad kiijie or aatanki sanghathan se lekar pratibandhit mulk siria kii madad karne vaali companiyon ke network kii hakeekat ko dekhiye
 The game you are being lied to in the name of fighting terror can make some sense
 is yuddh main siria ke raashtrapati ko bhi aaropee mana gaya he or unki sarkaar par america ne kai prakaar kii pabandi lagaai he
 Even after this, many companies are supplying oil and gas to Syria, which its fighter planes are flying
 panama papers se pataa chalata he ki kai companiyon ne apana ek network banaakar siria ko pambadi ke baad bhi supplai jari rakhi he
 Three such companies were also banned by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
 inamen se ek company ke liye lau form mosac phonseka ne bhi kaam kiya
 a spokesperson for Mossack Fonseca told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that his firm reviews and background checks those clients through intermediaries such as banks and other law firms that it sends to Mossack Fonseca
 america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) kii paabandiyon ke daayre main aane vaale qareeb 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mosac phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 The records say that Mossack Fonseca has made money by creating fake companies for suspected financiers of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 iske alaava mexico, guatemala or purvi europe ke drug maffia, iran or uttar korea main atom bam banane se judi jaankariyaan failaane waalon or dakshin africa ke arms dilers ke liye bhi shell companiyaan banane main mosac phonseka kaa role rahaa
 If this is true, then you should not have any difficulty in understanding the danger of having a company like Mossack Fonseca and relationship with it or taking convenience from it
 ye kisi eemaandaar or sajjan company he jo aatankwaadi sanghathan ke liye bhi company khulavaa detii he or drug mafia ke liye or niyamon ke aadhaar par safai de detii he ki ham to kuch hai hi nahin
 The bank has to review its customers and they give us a clean chit in opening the company for whom
 vaah re duniya
 So do you understand what the banks and lawyers are feeding together? is khulaase se pataa chalaa he ki varshon tak swiss banking company UBS or panama kii mosac phonseka ek duusare ke saath munaafe vaali saajhedaari main raheen
 UBS had customers who needed fake companies, ie shell companies, in other countries to hide their money
 mosac phonseka aisi companiyon ko banane main maahir thi
 But in 2010, UBS feared that it might face tax evasion and hawala cases in the US
 UBS bank ke diarector iske baad shell company ke is kaarobaar se baahar hone kii firaaq main lag gaye
 On 28 September 2010, in a meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, there was considerable tension in which UBS said that Mossack Fonseca is responsible for identifying the owners of shell companies behind the secret accounts, not the bank
 yaad kiijie abhi mosac phonseka kya kah rahi he
 She is saying that banks are not responsible for identifying dangerous customers
 to donon footbal khel rahe hai lagata he
 Dieter Buchholz, an employee of Mossack Fonseca, said his firm did not know who the real owners of some companies created for UBS customers were because the bank did not disclose it
 tippaniyan More than 500 banks, their subsidiaries and their branches had registered about 15,600 shell companies with Mossack Fonseca
 baad main ubis bank is khel se baahar ho gaya, apni nitiyaan badal lee
 How much we and you trust banks
 mosac phonseka ne aatankwaadi sanghathanon se lekar drug mafia ke liye farzi companiyaan khulawaain
 Helped to locate the money of the rich
 us phonseka se 500 bainkon ke rishte rahe
 Is it not a ruckus that no one wants to spoil this game of accumulation of capital in hands? kya yahi wo khel he jiske kaaran ek pratishat logon ke paas 90 fisadi sampatti par kabza he
 If everyone gets an equal chance in capitalism, then why is the whole pan on the side? kya ye sara khel poonjeevaad ke mul siddhant ke khilaaf nahin he
 By the way, i do not even know what the basic principle is, but i am asking you to understand and talk to you
 bharat main kya is vajah se bhi shanti he ki kisi bade netaa yaa dal kaa naam abhi tak nahin aayaa he yaa is vajah se ki udyogajagat ke naam aae hai or inke khilaaf koi bolnaa nahin chahta
 Despite this, the Indian government ordered an inquiry as soon as the news was published, the Congress gave the statement to hand over all the papers to the Supreme Court, but what else could happen after that
 baharhaal indian express akhbaar ne jin naamon ko chapa he unamem se amitabh bachchan or vakil harish salve kii safai ai he
 India Bulls, DLF and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also gave clarification on Monday
 amitabh bachchan ne safai main kaha, 'media ne jin companiyon kaa naam liya he main kisi ke bare main nahin jaanata
 i have never been a director in these companies
 ho saktaa he ki mere naam kaa galat istemaal hua ho
 i have paid all my taxes
 maine baahar jo kamaaya he wo kanoon ke daayre main hi kamaaya he or bhartiya kanoon ke anusaar tex bhi diya he
 Even the report of Indian Express does not tell what illegal work i have done
 mashhoor vakil harish salve ne kaha ki 'maine 2012 main crestbrit naam se ek holding company banaai thi lekin company ke paas koi sampatti nahin he, isaki aay shunya he
 i have been sending money out of law since 2003
 maine kuch paise england kii companiyon or america ke ek patent main lagaae hai
 Since 2014, i have been paying tax in two places, in England and India
 maine crestbite main kabhi paisa nahin rakhaa
 ' zyaadaatar logon kii safai main yahi baat nikal kar aa rahi he ki unhone niyamon ke tahat aisi companiyaan kholin or paison kaa nivesh kiya
 But can there be a question as to why there are taxports like Panama or British Virgin Islands in the world
 kya ham daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki panama jaise desh duniya bhar ke kaale dhan ko chhipaane ke adde nahin hai
 Everyone there opens the company and puts money according to the rules of their own country
 ek anumaan ke tahat aise 80 desh hai or yahaan hazaar baarah sau kharab rupee rakhe gaye hai
 Those who are hidden and who roam around the world
 ab itane ghumaavdaar maamle ko turant samaj janaa yaa kisi ko chor bataakar pakad lenaa na to aasaan he na hi uchit he
 Now here is another question which i understand and which i want to put before you
 jaise mosac phonseka naam kii kanoonee salaah dene vaali company ke sabhi graahak kaise ho sakate hai
 The wealthy industrialist following the rules also seeks Fonseca's help in building or buying the company
 drug mafia bhi apane kaale paise ko jamaa karne ke liye usee company kii madad letaa he
 The bank robbery gang also helps Fonseca to find the money
 aisa prathit hota he ki phonseka ek ghat he jahaan pani pine ke liye bakrii bhi aati he, hiran bhi aata he or baagh bhi aata he
 Where the crocodile also lives is cool
 kya phonseka jaisi company kaa astitv aatank or tarah-tarah ke bhrashtachar se jujh rahi duniya ke liye chunauti nahin he
 If no leader's name has come up, why is there no restlessness about the existence of companies like Fonseca
 phir to ye 370 patrakaron kaa saal bhar tak ek karod dastavezon kaa padhanaa ek bekaar abhyaas ghoshit kar dena chahie
 But if it was so useless, then when the Government of India enacted a law, then how did 2000 crore rupees come back for fear of it kaash ye bhi pataa hota ki ye paisa panama se hi aayaa he yaa mokama se aayaa he
 Mokama is in Bihar and the law i am referring to relates to the property that exists abroad
 indian express ne syria ke sandarbh main ek khabar chhaapi he jisase is masale ko samajhane main shaayad kuch madad mil sakati he
 There has been a civil war in Syria for six years, but this civil war is also a kind of small world war because it is a unique civil war of its own in which Russia is also dropping bombs, America, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Australia all together
 Dropping bombs
 samaadhaan hona to dur duniya ko ek or nae aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or bataaya jaataa he ki is laghu vishwayuddh sah grihayuddh main dhai lakh se adhik log maare gaye hai or lakhon log syria se visthapit ho gaye hai
 If you remember, in November 2015, Russia's President Putin alleged that he has the names of 40 countries from which the terrorist organization ISIS receives money
 vaise putin kaa bhi naam panama papers main aayaa he ki ve kathith rup se apane paise ko chhipaane ke liye mozaaq phonseka kii madad le rahe the
 Now remember the speeches of fighting the war against terror and see the reality of the network of companies helping the militant organization from banned terrorist countries
 aatank se ladane ke naam par aapako jo jhansa diya ja rahaa he wo khel kuch kuch samaj aa saktaa he
 The President of Syria has also been accused in this war and his government has imposed many kinds of restrictions on his government
 iske baad bhi kai companiyaan siria ko tel or gas kii supplai kar rahi hai jisase uske ladaaku vimaan ud rahe hai
 The Panama Papers show that many companies have continued to supply Syria even after the ban by creating a network of their own
 aisi teen companiyon par america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) ne pabandi bhi lagaai
 Law firm Mossack Fonseca also worked for one of these companies
 mosac phonseka ke ek pravaktaa ne international concortium of invastegative jarnlists (ICIJ) ko bataaya ki unki form bainkon or duusari lau ferms jaise bichauliyon ke zarie hi un graahakon kii samiksha karti he or unka becoground check karti he jinhen wo mosac phonseka ke paas bhejtaa he
 Mossack Fonseca has worked with close to 334 people and companies under the restrictions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department
 record kehete hai ki pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh financers ke liye farzi companiyaan banaakar mosac phonseka ne paisa kamaaya he
 In addition, Mossack Fonseca also played a role in building shell companies for drug mafia in Mexico, Guatemala and Eastern Europe, atom bomb makers in Iran and North Korea and arms dealers in South Africa
 agar ye baat sahi he to kya aap mosac phonseka jaisi company ke hone or usase sabake rishte yaa usase suvidha lene kaa khatra samajhane main dikkat nahin honi chahie
 What kind of honest and gentle company is this that makes the company open even for terrorist organization and gives clarification for the drug mafia and on the basis of rules that we are nothing
 bank ko apane graahakon kii samiksha kerani hoti he wo jane kis kis ke liye company khulwaane main hame clin chit dete hai
 Wow ray world
 to aapako kya ye samaj aa rahaa he ki bank or vakil milakar kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 This disclosure showed that Swiss banking company UBS and Panama's Mossack Fonseca had been in a profitable partnership with each other for years
 UBS main aise graahak the jinhen apane paise chhupaae rakhane ke liye duusare deshon main farzi companiyaan yani shell companiyaan chahie thim
 Mossack Fonseca was an expert in creating such companies
 lekin 2010 main UBS ko dar ho gaya ki america main us par tex chori or hawala ke maamle chal sakate hai
 The directors of UBS Bank then followed up with the idea of shell going out of business
 28 sitambar 2010 ko switsraland ke jurikh main ek baithak main kaaphi tanaav ho gaya jisamen UBS ne kaha ki sikret accounts ke peeche shell companiyon ke maalikon kii pahchaan ke liye mosac phonseka zimmedaar he, bank nahin
 Remember what Mossack Fonseca is saying right now
 wo kah rahi he ki khatarnaak graahakon kii pahchaan ke liye bank zimmedaar hai wo nahin
 So both seem to be playing football
 mosac phonseka ke karmchaaree Dieter Buchholz ne kaha ki unki form ko nahin pataa ki UBS ke graahakon ke liye banaai gai kuch companiyon ke asli maalik koun hai kyonki bank ne isaki jaankaree nahin di
 The comments 500 se zyaada bainkon, unki sahyogi companiyon or unki shakhaon ne mosac phonseka ke saath qareeb 15,600 shell companiyaan register kii thim
 Ubis Bank later dropped out of the game, changing its policies
 ham or aap bainkon par kitna bharosa karte hai
 Mossack Fonseca opened fake companies ranging from terrorist organizations to drug mafia
 amiron ke paise thikaane lagane main madad kii
 500 banks had links with that Fonseca
 kya isliye hangaamaa nahin he ki chand haathon main puunji jamaa hone ke is khel ko koi kharaab nahin karnaa chahta
 Is this the game that causes one percent people to own 90 percent of their property? poonjeevaad main agar sabko baraabar kaa chance miltaa he to sara palada ek pratisht kii taraf hi kyon hai
 Isn't this whole game against the basic principle of capitalism
 vaise mul siddhant kya he ye main bhi thik se nahin jaanata magar samajhane or aapse baat karne ke liye kah rahaa hum
 Amitabh Bachchan said in the cleanliness, 'I do not know of any companies the media has named
 main in companiyon main kabhi nideshak nahin rahaa
 My name may have been misused
 maine apane saare tex diye hai
 What i have earned outside, i have earned within the purview of law and have also given tax as per Indian law
 indian express kii report bhi nahin bataati he ki maine kya gaiyrkanoonee kaam kiya he
 Eminent lawyer Harish Salve said that 'I formed a holding company in 2012 named Crestbright but the company has no assets, its income is zero
 main kanoon ke anusaar 2003 se paisa baahar bhej rahaa hum
 i have invested some money in companies in England and in a US patent
 2014 ke baad se main do jagah tex de rahaa hum, england or bharat main
 i never put money in Crestbait
 ' The same thing is coming out in the cleaning of most people that they opened such companies and invested money under the rules
 par kya ye sawaal ho saktaa he ki duniya main panama yaa british varjin island jaise tex adde kyon hai
 Can we say with a claim that countries like Panama are not denominations of black money around the world
 vahaan par har koi apane apane desh ke niyam ke anusaar hi company kholta he or paise lagaataa he
 According to an estimate, there are 80 such countries and 12 thousand trillion rupees have been kept here
 jo chipa kar rakhe gaye hai or jo duniya bhar main ghoomte rahete hai
 Now it is neither easy nor appropriate to immediately understand such a curved case or catch someone as a thief
 ab yahaan ek or sawaal jo mujhe samaj main aa rahaa he or jo main aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum

 So both seem to be playing football
 mosac phonseka ke karmchaaree Dieter Buchholz ne kaha ki unki form ko nahin pataa ki UBS ke graahakon ke liye banaai gai kuch companiyon ke asli maalik koun hai kyonki bank ne isaki jaankaree nahin di
 The comments 500 se zyaada bainkon, unki sahyogi companiyon or unki shakhaon ne mosac phonseka ke saath qareeb 15,600 shell companiyaan register kii thim
 Ubis Bank later dropped out of the game, changing its policies
 ham or aap bainkon par kitna bharosa karte hai
 Mossack Fonseca opened fake companies ranging from terrorist organizations to drug mafia
 amiron ke paise thikaane lagane main madad kii
 500 banks had links with that Fonseca
 kya isliye hangaamaa nahin he ki chand haathon main puunji jamaa hone ke is khel ko koi kharaab nahin karnaa chahta
 Is this the game that causes one percent people to own 90 percent of their property? poonjeevaad main agar sabko baraabar kaa chance miltaa he to sara palada ek pratisht kii taraf hi kyon hai
 Isn't this whole game against the basic principle of capitalism
 vaise mul siddhant kya he ye main bhi thik se nahin jaanata magar samajhane or aapse baat karne ke liye kah rahaa hum
 The same thing is coming out in the cleaning of most people that they opened such companies and invested money under the rules
 par kya ye sawaal ho saktaa he ki duniya main panama yaa british varjin island jaise tex adde kyon hai
 Can we say with a claim that countries like Panama are not denominations of black money around the world
 vahaan par har koi apane apane desh ke niyam ke anusaar hi company kholta he or paise lagaataa he
 According to an estimate, there are 80 such countries and 12 thousand trillion rupees have been kept here
 jo chipa kar rakhe gaye hai or jo duniya bhar main ghoomte rahete hai
 Now it is neither easy nor appropriate to immediately understand such a curved case or catch someone as a thief
 ab yahaan ek or sawaal jo mujhe samaj main aa rahaa he or jo main aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 For example, how can a company named Mossack Fonseca have all its customers
 niyamon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi company banane yaa kareedne main phonseka kii madad letaa he
 The drug mafia also seeks the help of the same company to deposit its black money
 bank luutane vaala giroh bhi paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye phonseka kii madad karata he
 It seems that Fonseca is a ghat where a goat comes to drink water, a deer comes and a tiger
 jahaan magaramchh bhi sustaata rahata he
 Is not the existence of a company like Fonseca a challenge to the world battling terror and various types of corruption
 agar kisi netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa he to phonseka jaisi companiyon ke astitv ko lekar hi bechaini kyon nahin he
 Then these 370 journalists should declare reading one crore documents for a year a useless practice
 par itnaa bekaar hota to bharat sarkaar ne jab ek kanoon banaaya to uske dar se 2000 karod rupaya kaise waapas aa gaya
 i wish i had known that this money came from Panama or from Mokama
 mokama bihar main he or main jis kanoon kii baat kar rahaa hum uskaa sambandh videshon main maujuud sampatti se he
 The Indian Express has published a news report about Syria, which may help to understand this issue
 chah saal se syria main grih yuddh he lekin yah grih yuddh ek tarah se laghu vishwayuddh bhi he kyonki yah apni tarah kaa anokhaa grihayuddh he jisamen rus bhi bam gira rahaa he, america, france, jordan, saudi arab, turki, australia ye sab milakar bam gira rahe hai
 Far from being the solution, the world is facing another new terrorist organization ISIS and it is said that more than two and a half million people have been killed and millions displaced from Syria in this mini world war cum civil war
 aapako yaad ho to november 2015 main rus ke raashtrapati putin ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke paas 40 deshon ke naam hai jinase aatanki sanghathan iesas ko paisa miltaa he
 Putin has also been named in the Panama Papers for allegedly using the help of Mozak Fonseca to hide his money
 ab aap aatank ke khilaaf yuddh ladane ke bhaashanon ko yaad kiijie or aatanki sanghathan se lekar pratibandhit mulk siria kii madad karne vaali companiyon ke network kii hakeekat ko dekhiye
 The game you are being lied to in the name of fighting terror can make some sense
 is yuddh main siria ke raashtrapati ko bhi aaropee mana gaya he or unki sarkaar par america ne kai prakaar kii pabandi lagaai he
 Even after this, many companies are supplying oil and gas to Syria, which its fighter planes are flying
 panama papers se pataa chalata he ki kai companiyon ne apana ek network banaakar siria ko pambadi ke baad bhi supplai jari rakhi he
 Three such companies were also banned by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
 inamen se ek company ke liye lau form mosac phonseka ne bhi kaam kiya
 a spokesperson for Mossack Fonseca told the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that his firm reviews and background checks those clients through intermediaries such as banks and other law firms that it sends to Mossack Fonseca
 america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) kii paabandiyon ke daayre main aane vaale qareeb 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mosac phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 The records say that Mossack Fonseca has made money by creating fake companies for suspected financiers of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 iske alaava mexico, guatemala or purvi europe ke drug maffia, iran or uttar korea main atom bam banane se judi jaankariyaan failaane waalon or dakshin africa ke arms dilers ke liye bhi shell companiyaan banane main mosac phonseka kaa role rahaa
 If this is true, then you should not have any difficulty in understanding the danger of having a company like Mossack Fonseca and relationship with it or taking convenience from it
 ye kisi eemaandaar or sajjan company he jo aatankwaadi sanghathan ke liye bhi company khulavaa detii he or drug mafia ke liye or niyamon ke aadhaar par safai de detii he ki ham to kuch hai hi nahin
 The bank has to review its customers and they give us a clean chit in opening the company for whom
 vaah re duniya
 So do you understand what the banks and lawyers are feeding together? is khulaase se pataa chalaa he ki varshon tak swiss banking company UBS or panama kii mosac phonseka ek duusare ke saath munaafe vaali saajhedaari main raheen
 UBS had customers who needed fake companies, ie shell companies, in other countries to hide their money
 mosac phonseka aisi companiyon ko banane main maahir thi
 But in 2010, UBS feared that it might face tax evasion and hawala cases in the US
 UBS bank ke diarector iske baad shell company ke is kaarobaar se baahar hone kii firaaq main lag gaye
 On 28 September 2010, in a meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, there was considerable tension in which UBS said that Mossack Fonseca is responsible for identifying the owners of shell companies behind the secret accounts, not the bank
 yaad kiijie abhi mosac phonseka kya kah rahi he
 She is saying that banks are not responsible for identifying dangerous customers
 to donon footbal khel rahe hai lagata he
 Dieter Buchholz, an employee of Mossack Fonseca, said his firm did not know who the real owners of some companies created for UBS customers were because the bank did not disclose it
 tippaniyan More than 500 banks, their subsidiaries and their branches had registered about 15,600 shell companies with Mossack Fonseca
 baad main ubis bank is khel se baahar ho gaya, apni nitiyaan badal lee
 How much we and you trust banks
 mosac phonseka ne aatankwaadi sanghathanon se lekar drug mafia ke liye farzi companiyaan khulawaain
 Helped to locate the money of the rich
 us phonseka se 500 bainkon ke rishte rahe
 Is it not a ruckus that no one wants to spoil this game of accumulation of capital in hands? kya yahi wo khel he jiske kaaran ek pratishat logon ke paas 90 fisadi sampatti par kabza he
 If everyone gets an equal chance in capitalism, then why is the whole pan on the side? kya ye sara khel poonjeevaad ke mul siddhant ke khilaaf nahin he
 By the way, i do not even know what the basic principle is, but i am asking you to understand and talk to you
 aisa prathit hota he ki phonseka ek ghat he jahaan pani pine ke liye bakrii bhi aati he, hiran bhi aata he or baagh bhi aata he
 Where the crocodile also lives is cool
 kya phonseka jaisi company kaa astitv aatank or tarah-tarah ke bhrashtachar se jujh rahi duniya ke liye chunauti nahin he
 If no leader's name has come up, why is there no restlessness about the existence of companies like Fonseca
 phir to ye 370 patrakaron kaa saal bhar tak ek karod dastavezon kaa padhanaa ek bekaar abhyaas ghoshit kar dena chahie
 But if it was so useless, then when the Government of India enacted a law, then how did 2000 crore rupees come back for fear of it kaash ye bhi pataa hota ki ye paisa panama se hi aayaa he yaa mokama se aayaa he
 Mokama is in Bihar and the law i am referring to relates to the property that exists abroad
 indian express ne syria ke sandarbh main ek khabar chhaapi he jisase is masale ko samajhane main shaayad kuch madad mil sakati he
 There has been a civil war in Syria for six years, but this civil war is also a kind of small world war because it is a unique civil war of its own in which Russia is also dropping bombs, America, France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Australia all together
 Dropping bombs
 samaadhaan hona to dur duniya ko ek or nae aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he or bataaya jaataa he ki is laghu vishwayuddh sah grihayuddh main dhai lakh se adhik log maare gaye hai or lakhon log syria se visthapit ho gaye hai
 If you remember, in November 2015, Russia's President Putin alleged that he has the names of 40 countries from which the terrorist organization ISIS receives money
 vaise putin kaa bhi naam panama papers main aayaa he ki ve kathith rup se apane paise ko chhipaane ke liye mozaaq phonseka kii madad le rahe the
 Now remember the speeches of fighting the war against terror and see the reality of the network of companies helping the militant organization from banned terrorist countries
 aatank se ladane ke naam par aapako jo jhansa diya ja rahaa he wo khel kuch kuch samaj aa saktaa he
 The President of Syria has also been accused in this war and his government has imposed many kinds of restrictions on his government
 iske baad bhi kai companiyaan siria ko tel or gas kii supplai kar rahi hai jisase uske ladaaku vimaan ud rahe hai
 The Panama Papers show that many companies have continued to supply Syria even after the ban by creating a network of their own
 aisi teen companiyon par america ke tregeri department ke offis of fahrren asets control (oefasi) ne pabandi bhi lagaai
 Law firm Mossack Fonseca also worked for one of these companies
 mosac phonseka ke ek pravaktaa ne international concortium of invastegative jarnlists (ICIJ) ko bataaya ki unki form bainkon or duusari lau ferms jaise bichauliyon ke zarie hi un graahakon kii samiksha karti he or unka becoground check karti he jinhen wo mosac phonseka ke paas bhejtaa he
 Mossack Fonseca has worked with close to 334 people and companies under the restrictions of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Treasury Department
 record kehete hai ki pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh financers ke liye farzi companiyaan banaakar mosac phonseka ne paisa kamaaya he
 In addition, Mossack Fonseca also played a role in building shell companies for drug mafia in Mexico, Guatemala and Eastern Europe, atom bomb makers in Iran and North Korea and arms dealers in South Africa
 agar ye baat sahi he to kya aap mosac phonseka jaisi company ke hone or usase sabake rishte yaa usase suvidha lene kaa khatra samajhane main dikkat nahin honi chahie
 What kind of honest and gentle company is this that makes the company open even for terrorist organization and gives clarification for the drug mafia and on the basis of rules that we are nothing
 bank ko apane graahakon kii samiksha kerani hoti he wo jane kis kis ke liye company khulwaane main hame clin chit dete hai
 Wow ray world
 to aapako kya ye samaj aa rahaa he ki bank or vakil milakar kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 This disclosure showed that Swiss banking company UBS and Panama's Mossack Fonseca had been in a profitable partnership with each other for years
 UBS main aise graahak the jinhen apane paise chhupaae rakhane ke liye duusare deshon main farzi companiyaan yani shell companiyaan chahie thim
 Mossack Fonseca was an expert in creating such companies
 lekin 2010 main UBS ko dar ho gaya ki america main us par tex chori or hawala ke maamle chal sakate hai
 The directors of UBS Bank then followed up with the idea of shell going out of business
 28 sitambar 2010 ko switsraland ke jurikh main ek baithak main kaaphi tanaav ho gaya jisamen UBS ne kaha ki sikret accounts ke peeche shell companiyon ke maalikon kii pahchaan ke liye mosac phonseka zimmedaar he, bank nahin

 is dosti main bani kai baar shikaayat karte dikh jaati hai lekin aisa pehali baar hua he jab gaurav bhi ghar ke anya sadasyon se bani ke vyavhaar ke bare main baat karte dikhenge
 Gaurav will also complain to Manveer about this behavior
 jahaan bani or gaurav kii ghar dosti khatre main hai, vahiin manvari or manu bhi captainsi ko lekar aapas main jhagad chuke hai
 In such a situation, it has to be seen whether Gaurav and Bani will learn anything from this or will sacrifice their friends in this battle of power

 bani or gaurav kii dosti par aksar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Many times the caller who calls in the house has also asked what is the secret of this friendship
 haal hi main viand ke apisod main salmaan khan ne yahaan tak kah diya ki aap donon pati-patni kii tarah ladate hai
 According to the information, there is going to be a quarrel between Bani and Gaurav in this work of ongoing captivity within the house

 Bani has to cry on this matter
 bani se is vyavhaar se gaurav itnaa pareshaan hote hai ki vah saare points bani ko dekar vahaan se chale jate hai
 In this friend, Bani is seen complaining many times but this is the first time Gaurav will also be seen talking to other members of the house about Bani's behavior

 supreme court main vakil or bijepi netaa ashvini upaadhyaay kii ore se daakhil yachika main kaha gaya he ki 35A samvidhan ke moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf he
 This is a clear violation of the right to equality

 It is expected that along with the same original petition, the questions raised in this petition will also be heard
 upaadhyaay kii daleel he ki samvidhan main sanshodhan kaa adhikaar raashtrapati ke paas nahin he
 This is the right of Parliament, but Article 35A decades ago was added to the Constitution in 1955 by a government order signed by then President Dr
 Rajendra Prasad
 hairat kii baat he ki tab se ab tak ise sansad ke saamne manjuuri ke liye laayaa hi nahin gaya
 According to the petition, even if the rest of the citizens of India are left out, the people of Dalit and Valmiki society who have been living in Jammu and Kashmir since 1955 have also not been given the right to equality
 unako samanta, vyapaar, soochna, swasthya or shiksha kaa adhikaar nahin detaa
 It has been said in the petition that because of 35A they are not getting these rights
 lihaaja inhen sab vajahon se 35A samvidhan ke mul dhaanche or bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Therefore, either it should be removed or appropriate provisions should be added by debating it in the Parliament so that it is compatible with the spirit of the constitution and because of this, basic rights are not violated

 upi main bijepi kii baari badhat ne ek baar phir siyasat main piem narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ke varchasv par muhar laga di he
 While bjp's explosive edge in UP has proved Amit Shah to be the 'chanakya' of politics, Narendra Modi has emerged as a 'dream merchant'
 in chunaavon ne piem modi ke notebandi or sargical strike jaise sakht faislon par muhar laga di he
 With this, it has been proved that Modi and Shah are the most recent phase of Indian politics and with the passage of time this period will be known as modi-shah era
 is jodi kii aakraamak style kaa hi yah nateeja rahaa he ki upi or uttarakhand jaise rajya kesaria rang main sarabor ho gaye hai
 Amit Shah has emerged as Chanakya because he has retained his dominance in UP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main upi main bijepi ko 71 siten mili thim or is baar bhi amit shah ne apane khaas andaaj main hi khaskar upi main chunaav ladaa
 Alliances with small parties
 pichde varg or dalit votbank ko apni taraf laane ke liye duusare dalon se party main aane vaale pratyaashiyon par bharosa jataayaa

 Even in the most divided party, there was dissatisfaction with the ticket distribution and before the start of elections, it was believed that Akhilesh could be the worst
 lekin upi chunaav shuru hone ke saath piem modi ke prachaar main utarane ke saath hi puraa maahaul badalanaa shuru ho gaya

 Actually, about PM Modi political analysts believe that he fully understands the public sentiment and takes decisions accordingly
 iske chalate janata ke jehan main is daur main vah puri tarah se haaavee ho chuke hai
 Perhaps this is the reason that even after taking tough decisions like demonetisation, people get immense support and win the hearts of the people by taking decisions like cross-border surgical strikes

 avishvaas prastaav par charchaa evam voting ke liye loksabhaa adhyaksh ne shuukravaar kaa din mukarrar kiya he
 Politics is going to be a twenty-twenty match on the pretext of no confidence motion in the Lok Sabha, in which both the power and the opposition have a lot of opportunity to bat immediately before 2019
 congress sahit zyaadaatar vipakshi dal ekajute hai, lekin modi sarkaar ise lekar zyada ashankit nahin dikh rahi he
 Modi has enough numbers, in such a situation the government will easily cross the fire test of the no confidence motion in the House
 aise main endie sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh avishvaas prastaav laakar piem modi ke daanv main kahin funs to nahin gaya he
 Let us tell that Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan did not accept the no-confidence motion on the issue of failures of Modi government by Congress, but he approved the no-confidence motion on the issue of special status status given to Andhra Pradesh by TDP
 bijepi ke netritv vaali endiemen tidipi ek samay partner rahi he
 TDP is separated after breaking ties with Andhra Pradesh on special package issue
 iske baad se lagaataar avishvaas prastaav kii maang karti rahi, jiskaa samarthan congress sahit vipaksh kii duusari partiyaan bhi kar rahi thim
 On the very first day of the monsoon session, parties like TDP, Congress, NCP again proposed a no-confidence motion
 is par loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne tidipi ke dwaara laae gaye avishvaas prastaav ko manjuur kar liya
 After this, the day of discussion and voting was also fixed
 haalanki modi sarkaar pichley do satr se vipaksh ke dwaara laae jane vaale avishvaas prastaav se bachati rahi he
 The Lok Sabha speaker did not approve the no-confidence motion despite several attempts by Congress and YSR Congress in the budget session
 aise main avishvaas prastaav ko monsoon satr ke pehle din hi notice kar lenaa or charchaa or voting kaa din bhi tay kar dene se kahin piem modi ke 'trep' main vipaksh funs to nahin gaya
 The Lok Sabha with 545 members currently has 535 mps
 yani bijepi ko bahumat hasil karne ke liye mahaj 268 saansad chahie
 The BJP currently has 273 members, replacing the Lok Sabha Speaker
 iske alaava bijepi ke sahyogi dalon main shivasena ke 18, algepi ke 6, akali dal ke 4, araspi ke 3, jediu ke 2, apana dal ke 2 anya ke 6 sadsy hai
 In this way the total number is reaching 314
 aise main bijepi ko avishvaas prastaav ko giraane or sarkaar ko bachaane main koi dikkat nahin hone vaali
 The no-confidence motion is a litmus test for the Modi government
 loksabhaa main philhal bijepi ke paas akele 273 saansad hai
 While for the majority it needs a figure of 272 mps
 aise main bijepi ke paas bahumat se ek sadsy zyada he
 But at present, many BJP mps are rebel
 inamen shatrughna sinha, kirti aaazaad or savitri bai phule shaamil hai
 In such a situation, if the three seats are reduced, the BJP has a figure of 270, whereas it needs only 268 votes for the majority
 matlab modi sarkaar ko avishvaas prastaav giraane ke liye sahyogiyon kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 Talking about the opposition parties, Congress currently holds the maximum 48 seats in the Lok Sabha
 avishvaas prastaav laane vaali tidipi ke paas 16 siten hai, jabaki jedies ke 1, ensipi ke 7, argedy ke 4, tiemasi ke 34, sipiiem ke 9, sapa ke 7 sadsy hai
 Apart from this, there are 4 members of Aam Aadmi, 11 of TRS, 4 of YSR Congress, 3 of AUDF and 20 of BJD
 inhen mila lete hai phir bhi 268 ke aankade ko chhu nahin paa rahe hai
 It is thus clear that the motion of no confidence in the house is set to fall
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne niti ayog kii baithak main ek baar phir se apane soobe ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa maamla uthaaya
 In the fourth meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog held at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Sunday, Nitish Kumar made strong arguments in favor of granting special state status to Bihar
 is dauraan unhone kai suzav bhi die or kaha ki mid de mile skim se vidhyalay ab bhojashala banakar rah gaye hai
 Therefore, it would be better to provide funds to the children for nutrition, so that a reading environment can be created in schools
 siem nitish kumaar ne rashtriya fasal beemaa kaa bhi maamla uthaaya or kaha ki beemaa yojana main adhikansh premium beemaa companiyon ko chalaa jaataa he, isliye bihar rajya fasal sahaayta yojana kii shuruyaat kii he
 He said that liquor ban, child marriage and anti-dowry campaign are going on in Bihar
 iske liye niti ayog kaa vishesh sahyog milanaa chahie or atirikt sansaadhan uplabdh karaae jane chahie
 Nitish Kumar first demanded the grant of special state status to Bihar and said that if the data related to the level variation of inter-regional and inter-state development is reviewed, it will be found that many states are significantly above the national average on various parameters of development Are below
 in maapdandon main prati vyakti aay, shiksha, swasthya, urja, maanav vikaas suchakank aadi shaamil hai
 He said that a rational economic strategy would be the one which would encourage such investment and transfer system, which would help the backward states to reach the national average of development in a stipulated time frame
 hamaari vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang is avadharana par aadhaarit he
 We are constantly demanding from the Central Government to give special status to Bihar
 biharko vishesh rajya kaa darja praapt hone se chahumukhi vikaas hoga
 The state will have the opportunity to use its resources in other development and welfare schemes
 vahiin, duusari ore vishesh rajya kaa darja praapt rajyon ke anuroop kendriya jiesti main anumaanya pratipurti milane se nijee nivesh ko protsaahan milegaa
 The state will have factories, new employment opportunities will be created and people's living standards will improve

 Confusion was spread among the people

 Nitish made it clear that he has not taken the decision to leave the CM post after getting emotional

 The decision was taken after talks with party members because extraordinary circumstances had arisen in front of us

 Also spoke to the party president
 lekin koi saathi shuru main taiyaar nahin hua
 He said, 'the day the results were coming, people felt that i was saying in the flow of emotion
 ek din kaa intjaar kiya
 Talked to colleagues
 vichaar prakat kiye
 Friends felt that the decision was based on moral values
 unhone kaha aap ye faisla le sakate hai
 Then resigned
 'istife ke baad mache siyaasi bavaal par nitish ne kaha, 'vidhayak dal kii baithak bulaai
 The atmosphere was like this
 koi baat sunne ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Unanimously decided that we choose you again
 maine puri baat bataai
 Even then they persevered
 maine kaha ki vichaar karne ke liye samay dijie
 Then called the meeting
 kal jo baithak main ek ek baat saamne rakhi
 After that we talked separately and in groups with MLA colleagues
 log santusht hue
 When the Legislature Party met today, the 'moral' of those people rose
 unhone kaha ki hamen is faisle par garv he
 This is not a simple decision
 hamaare saamne asaadhaaran halaat hai
 Extraordinary decisions have to be made to fight them
 'jedy(you) netaa ne kaha, 'hamane chaatr jivan main, jepi andolan main rahete hue sangharsh kiya

 Today nobody in Bihar can say that the work did not happen

 Now they will sit in the party discussing with all colleagues

 We will make an action plan about this
 lekin vidhayakon ne mere faisle ko sweekaar kar liya he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to surprise by referring to a whatsapp video of a beggar using a swipe machine at an election public meeting in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh on 3 December

 However, he may have been deliberately trying to put a political coating on the facts which obstruct it
 notebandi ke baad jis tarah se bahes kii disha ko kaale dhan se cashles or phir les cash iconomi kii taraf modaa gaya, usase sarkaar kii hataasha jaahir ho gai
 The government realized that the country's structure is not ready for such a big change overnight
 aabaadi ke lihaaj se nakadi lenden ke aparyaapt buniyadi dhaanche ke saath rigerv bank or sarkaar kii aadhi-adhuri taiyaari kaa hi nateeja tha ki nal ke pani kii tarah jivan style kaa hissaa ban chukaa atm kaa samoochaa tantra thahar-sa gaya
 The main reason for this was that till November 8, ATM had become the only means of cash withdrawal
 adhikansh logon ko shaayad hi yaad hoga ki 8 november se pehle ve kab bank kii shakha main gaye honge
 But even after a month of demonetisation, endless queues outside the atms and no-cash (not banked) boards at the banks of banks are in the news
 aise main yah sawaal lajimi he ki sarkaar or arabiai ke daawey or prabandhan kahaan dhare rah gaye
 Scattered with misinterpretation, just one and a half hours after Prime Minister Modi's address to the nation, the first information is given to the ATM network networks at 8 pm on November 8 that RBI Governor Urjit Patel called a meeting on 9 November
 is baithak main chaar bade bank—esbiai, exis bank, isiisiaai, echdiefasi, atm network kii do badi company ensiaar korporation, dybold or cash logisticks ke pratinidhiyon ko bulaayaa gaya
 New notes were shown for the first time in this meeting
 sutron ke mutabik, is baithak main urjit patel ne teen kaam tatkaal karne ke nirdesh die
 One, as much as Rs 1000-500
 ke puraane note atm network main hai, use 48 ghante main waapas laana
 He named it OHD (old high-denomination Currency Evacuation)
 duusare, atm ricalibrasion (nae note ke aakaar ke hisaab se trey main badlaav) kaa kaam yuddh str par shuru karen
 Thirdly, as long as the entire process is underway, cash logistics companies will make Rs 100-100 at atms
 ke note bharen
 But the amount of payment for this additional work could not be fixed and no single mechanism for coordination could be established
 isliye cash logisticks company ne puraani karency kii nikasi to kii lekin atm ricalibrasion kaa kaam nahin shuru ho sakaa
 According to sources, on November 13, after the Prime Minister returned from Japan, a note dealing with the problem of demonetisation was prepared by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Energy Minister Piyush Goyal before the Prime Minister
 uske baad 14 november ko arabiai kii ore se ricalibrasion kar atm ko nae note ke aakaar ke hisaab se taiyaar karne ke liye ek badi task force gathit kii gai
 Then, for the first time a Common Action Plan (CAP) was prepared
 mumbai ke vikroli main samanvay se jude 50 logon kii team bulaakar—paisa nikasi, ricalibrasion, paisa bharne kii prakriya ko tay vakt ke saath karne kii ruparekha banaai gai
 The work of repairing the ATM was started on 15 November, a week after the demonetisation
 atm or cash tantra kii mushkilenetm kaa puraa tantra outsource he
 The entire network of how much cash to put in an ATM, how to raise cash from banks and cash processing according to the ATM is different from the banking system
 is vakt desh main kareeb 2,25,000 atm hai, jinamein 25,000 cash diposit ke liye hai
 The rest is with individual companies (see box)
 bank in atm ko do model- capex or opex model par chalaati he
 The capex has a machine with its own capital, while the opex has outside machines and is maintained by companies
 companiyon ke paas kareeb 25,000 atm ejeeniyar hai, jinhone is kaam ko anjaam diya
 Cash logistics companies play the role of last mile connectivity in this
 atm network main esbiai, exis, echdiefasi or isiisei kii hissedari 65 fisadi tak he
 Cash Logistics has leading companies like sis-prosigor, CMS, Brinks, Writer Safeguard, logicash
 aankadon ke mutabik, cash prabandhan main 10,000 cash vine hai, jisamen 8,800 panjikrut hai
 There are 300 cash vaults and a total of 48,000 employees, including drivers, security personnel, cash custodians, vault officers, cash processing personnel, etc
 lekin notebandi ke baad itane kam mainpavar se is oparation ko anjaam dena sambhav nahin tha
 Rituraj Sinha, president of the Cash Logistics Association, says, "there has been unprecedented work after demonetisation
 shuruaati chaar raat so nahin paae
 We asked our employees to do whatever is needed in a campaign against black money
 is ladaai main jo yogadan dena chaahate hai, ve do jodi kapadaa or toothbrush lekar aa jaaen
 Our personnel contributed commendably to this
 " jabaki atm prabandhan main agrani company ensiaar korporation ke emdi navroj dastur ne kaha ki har atm par ejeeniyar ko jaakar casets main component change karnaa tha, jise yuddh str par kiya gaya
 However, the cost of this entire operation is still going on
 dastur kehete hai ki is kaam kaa atirikt bhugtan karnaa hoga
 At present, RBI has formed a separate committee under the SBI COO Prashant Kumar for additional payment of these companies
 lekin atm thap kyon pade hai? dastur kehete hai, ''atm kharabi kii vajah se nahin balki cash kii kami kii vajah se thap pade hai
 "bridging the cash shortage may be far-fetched and the RBI may make a million claims, but due to the speed of printing the note and transporting it to bank-atms, no one is in a position to say when the situation will be normal
 logon kii jivan rekha bani atm ke aage lambii qatari kii vajah karency kii kami he
 According to sources, at the time of ATM pay-pension before 8 November, from 1 to 10 date daily, 10-12 thousand crore rupees
 bhare jate the or baaki dinon main 7-8 hajaar karod ru
 But the post-demonetisation situation is pathetic
 sutron ke mutabik, cash logisticks companiyon ko kul milakar pehle se ek-tihaai se bhi kam nakadi atm main bharne ke liye uplabdh karai ja rahi he
 An official says that even at the time of salary, only 2800-4000 crores to be filled in the ATM
 kii raashi upaladbradh ho paa rahi he
 However, the arguments of Dastur and Sinha are different in this case
 unka kahana he ki yah aadha sach he kyonki pehle atm ke jariye zyada nakadi nikaali jaati thi, lekin aaj bank or pioes madhyam par bhi boj badha he jisase nakadi kaa hissaa bant gaya he, isliye cash logisticks ko kam mil rahaa he
 The laggard government in the digital framework, 98% of transactions in India are in cash
 aankade bataate hai ki pichley paanch saal main 15 fisadi salanaa kii dar se karency cirkulation badha he
 Cash velocity has also increased due to increase in population, shops and more bank-atms
 lekin jis gati se arthvyavastha badi he, us anupaat main mani tranjaction kaa dhaancha badhaane kii disha main sarkaar or arabiai ne thos kadam nahin uthaae
 Following Prime Minister Modi's appeal, the BJP and the government have been continuously campaigning to promote digital transactions
 lekin is maamle main sarkaar tathyon se munh chhipaati dikh rahi he
 It is constantly being publicized that the cash-to-gdp ratio in India is quite high
 japan main bharat ke mukaable yah kareeb doguna he
 Compared to other countries like India, this attempt to spread illusion is far from the truth
 bharat main prati 10 lakh par 108 bank shakhaaen, 149 atm or 889 pioes mashine hai
 (see comparative graphic of other countries) Rupay card or debit card is mostly used for cash withdrawal from atms
 modi sarkaar bhale ise aitihaasik kadam bataae, lekin jaankaron kii maane to isse digital lenden 2-3 fisadi se zyada nahin badaae vaala
 In such a situation, how much the people struggling with the mess of problems will change, perhaps Modi has understood well
 maldive main supreme court or sarkaar ke bich takaraav bad gaya he
 The situation has become such that the Supreme Court has ordered the arrest of President Abdulla Yameen
 jabaki raashtrapati ne court kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 The Maldives army surrounded the parliament complex on Sunday
 is siyaasi tufaan ke bich supreme court ne bharat samet duusare loktantric deshon se madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 Why the controversy arose, the Supreme Court of Maldives on Thursday ordered the immediate release of other inmates, including exiled former President Mohammad Nasheed
 magar, raashtrapati abdulla yamin ne court kaa ye order maanane se inkaar kar diya
 The court ordered release of 9 political prisoners including Nasheed and reinstatement of 12 Members of Parliament
 court ne kaha tha asantushton ko avashya reeha kiya janaa chahie kyonki unke khilaaf mukadmaa raajnneeti se prerit or galat tha
 What the court said: "nothing prevents the prosecutor from prosecuting them once the order is followed and the prisoners are released
" 'yamin kii kursi ko khatradarasal, 12 saansadon ko behaal karne ke supreme court ke aadesh se maujuuda raashtrapati abdulla yamin kii party alpamat main aa jaaegi
 After which they may face the risk of impeachment
 aisa isliye, kyonki ye saansad satta paksh se alag hokar vipaksh main shaamil ho gaye the
 Two mps arrested Meanwhile, the police have arrested two opposition mps
 ye saansad ravivaar ko hi swadesh laute the
 The statement of the opposition, the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), said that they were not allowed to hold the meeting
 sarkaar ne surakshabalon kaa istemaal kar unhen meeting nahin karne di
 There is a long confrontation situation in Force Postanatmaldev inside Parliament
 yahaan kii sansad 'pipuls majalis' ke andar pichley saal march se sashastr bal tainaat hai, jab yamin ne unhen ansatusht saansadon ko nikaalane kaa aadesh diya tha
 What is the government's side, it has been said on behalf of the government, that any decision of the Supreme Court to arrest the President would be unconstitutional and illegal
 isliye police or sena se kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi asanvaidhanik aadesh kaa anupaalan na karen
 'old controversy is' The current opposition leader Mohammad Nasheed became the first elected President of Maldives
 march 2015 main unhen aatank ke aaropon main 13 saal jail kii sajaa sunai gai
 After which Abdullah Yameen became President
 beete guuruuvaar ko supreme court ne nashid ke khilaaf cese ko raajnneeti se prerit bataaya or unhen reeha karne kaa aadesh diya
 At the same time, the Supreme Court gave orders for the reinstatement of 12 mps who broke away from Yameen's party
 agar, supreme court kaa aadesh lagu hota he to maujuuda raashtrapati kii kursi ja sakati he
 This is the reason why they are refusing to obey the order, due to which the Supreme Court has requested India to help save democracy and the Constitution
