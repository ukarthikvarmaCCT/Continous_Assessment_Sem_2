 dilli ke paryaton mantri kapil mishra ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko patr likhakar mahabuuba mufti se puche gaye apane sawaalon par jawaab maanga he
 Kapil has asked Amit Shah in the letter that he met Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday
 maine unase chaar sawaal puche
 i asked her if she considers Burhan Wani a terrorist? Does Afzal consider Guru a terrorist? Every day our brave soldiers in Kashmir are being martyred by uttering Bharat Mata Ki Jai, will Mehbooba Mufti speak Bharat Mata Ki Jai? Kapil Mishra has written that he did not answer any of these three questions out of four, and what is his answer, You also know this and the whole country
 chauthaa sawaal maine unase JNU main desh virdohi or afjal guru ke samarthan main lage naaron ke bare main poocha
 He responded to this by saying that raising such slogans in the university is part of democracy
 25 march ko maine aapako ek patr likhaa tha, or yahi sawaal aapse puche the ki jab mahabuuba mufti or unki party PDP khuleam desh virdohi or aatankiyon kii samarthak he tab bhi bhaajapa unke saath sarkaar kyon bana rahi he
 You have not given any answer
 ye sawaal uth rahe the ki JNU main jin kashmiri ladakon ne naare lagaaye mahabuuba mufti ke dabaav main centre sarkaar ne un par koi karrwai na karne kaa nirnay liya
 On Tuesday, Mehbooba Mufti made a similar gesture that she does not want any action to be taken on the JNU issue
 ye kya he sar? kahaan gai bhaajapa kii deshbhakti or rashtraprem kii badi badi baaten
 Such a big compromise for power? This is a fraud with the whole country
 kapil mishra ne poocha he ki jaraa sochie hamaare sena ke manobal par kya asar padataa hoga jab unhen pataa chalata hoga kii jin aatankiyon se wo ladate he, jin aatankiyon ko wo maarthe hai
 The Chief Minister does not consider him a terrorist
 kapil mishra ne poocha he ki sochiye sainikon ko kitna dukh hota hoga ye jaanakar ki desh kii sattadhari bhaajapa aise logo ko samarthan de rahi he jo burhan vaani or afjal guru ko hero banaate hai
 What will happen to the army soldiers when they see you laughing, talking, running the government with Mehbooba Mufti, how much of the army's morale will be broken on the day the ISI came to investigate Pathankot
 kitne shaheedon kii atmaaen tadpi hongi us kaale din
 What is the compulsion of friendship with such people who have a soft corner for terrorists? Will you answer the questions to which Mehbooba Mufti did not answer? Apart from this, Kapil Mishra also questioned in the letter about not snatching the status of the most favored nation from Pakistan
 chitthee ke akhir main kapil mishra ne amit shah se 2 sawaal bhi puche hai-1
 Who has stopped you from declaring Pakistan as a terrorist nation by calling a session of the House? Why not declare Pakistan a terrorist country? 2

 Former Home Minister Buta Singh called senior BJP leader LK Advani a 'grandfather' of the 2G spectrum scam and demanded that he be questioned in the matter and advised social activist Anna Hazare to stay away from politics
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To participate, Buta Singh, who attended a mass wedding ceremony organized by a religious organization in Jalandhar, said that the UPA government at the Center alone is not to blame for the 2G spectrum
 isaki tah tak janaa jaruri he
 This scandal has been happening since LK Advani was the information broadcasting minister
 vahi is ghotaale ke sutaradhar hai
 Chidambaram is guilty in 2G scam: Swamibuta insisted that Advani should also be questioned in this case so that the correct information can be revealed
 iske liye samprag sarkaar or congress par sara dosha madhnaa uchit nahin he
 Chidambaram set to go to jail: When asked about Anna Hazare's appeal not to vote for Congress in Shahnawaz Hussainhisar Lok Sabha by-election, he said that Anna Hazare should avoid this politics or else his image will be tarnished
 unhone kaha ki anna ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 There is no doubt that it is in the national interest but they need to avoid politics
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki mahagathbandhan ke sheersh netaaon main behatar samanvay he
 The judicious people of Bihar have given a historic majority by giving immense support and infinite respect to the policies and programs of the Grand Alliance
 yah bahumat janata ke sarokaaron ke prati samarpit va patibaddh he
 BJP and their supporting institutions are not shaving our unity
 2019 main bijepi ko haraane main mahagathbandhan kii sabase ahm bhoomika hogi
 Apart from this, some leaders of the coalition also keep making unnecessary statements about personal interests so that they remain in the news
 party main chal rahi bayaan baaji par tejasvi ne kaha ki har dal main kuch aise vyakti hote he jo mandet yaa janabhaavana kaa samarthan naa karke apane nijee hiton ko sarvopari rakhte hai
 Such people have their own personal beliefs and sufferings which they associate with the party and coalition through the media
 haalanki vaastaviktaa main aisa nahin he
 The intention of a party in the media can only be given by its official spokesperson
 ve kehete hai ki unke dal kii taraf se sabhi media pratishthanon ko pradesh adhyaksh kii taraf se kai baar chitthee bhi bheji ja chuki he
 It clearly states that only designated spokespersons are authorized to make official statements on the issues related to the party but still that request and information is not followed by them and they take the statement from the unauthorized person of their choice and send it to the party
 Let's go by telling the official statement
 media ko bhi mirch-masala chahie hota he isliye aise vyakti kaa bayaan chalaate hai jo party kii taraf se bolne ke liye namit nahin he
 They further say that some such people have disciplinary action on behalf of the party and further violations will be taken
 ve kehete hai ki unki party bhale hi maas party ho lekin ve anushaasan se koi samjhauta nahin karenge or kisi ke nijee mantavya or hit ko party ke mat se jodne kii koshish karne vaale par karrwai karenge
 The right to make a statement on the alliance is reserved only by the national president rather than a legislator or leader
 kisi bhi surat main gathbandhan se sambaddh maamla teenon partiyon ke rashtriya adhyakshon kaa masalaa he
 In such a situation, it is not worth commenting on it
 agar kisi ko kisi prakaar kii pareshaani he to media ke bajaay sambandhit plateform par hi uski baat kii jaani chahie
 They are very serious about this
 unhone aage kaha ki mahagathbandhan himalay kii tarah majboot or atoot he
 The bjp's intention to win Bihar is never going to be fulfilled
 bihar kaa mahagathbandhan to desh kii vartmaan raajnneeti kaa sabsesuneharaa evam sakaaratmak adhyayhe
 It is due to this grand alliance that from November 2015 to March 2017, the country was living in peace and brotherhood, otherwise since the UP elections, the whole country is living in an atmosphere of chaos and panic
 kab teen logon kaa jhund kis vyakti ko dharm, bhojan, pahanaave yaa chhadam rashtrawaad ke naam par maar den koun jaanata he?bijepi pryojit bheed ne loktantr ko daratantr main tabdeel kar diya he
 Therefore, the regional parties of the entire country are under pressure from the judicious and fanatical people there to form a grand alliance like Bihar and defeat the fascist forces that break the country
 jo log mahagathbandhan tuutane kii aashaa kar rahe he unke liye itnaa hi kahana he kii yah sapana puraa nahin hone vaala he
 The Grand Alliance will have the most important role in defeating the BJP in 2019

 CM Chavan says that he will not share the stage with the PM at the inauguration of Nagpur Metro on August 21
 darasal, bhupendra singh hooda ne kaithal main piem modi ke saath manch saajha kiya
 During this, there was a fierce hooting against Hooda

 But they are repeatedly giving political color to government programs

 The Congress high command has also been shocked by the Haryana Chief Minister's hooting

 php / target-audience-media The Kejriwal government of the Aam Aadmi Party government, which holds the power of Delhi, is once again preparing to raise its issue loudly to give Delhi full statehood
 dilli ke siem aravind kejariwal ne dilli ke shahari vikaas mantralay ko chitthee likhakar kaha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye kis tarah se janamat sangrah karavaaya ja saktaa he is par ek physibility report taiyaar karen
 Remember that Kejriwal had raised the issue with PM Narendra Modi in his first meeting as soon as he became CM in February this year
 saath hi kejariwal kii taraf se grahamantri ke saath uske baad bahut si baithak main purna rajya kaa mudda uthta rahaa
 The comments kejariwal jabase sarkaar main aae hai tabase apane liye zyaada adhikaar kii maang kar rahe hai kyonki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja nahin he or isliye yahaan par aajkal ye hi saafe nahin he ki ek chuni hui sarkaar or ek niyukt alji ke kya-kya adhikaar hai or kahaan tak hai
 Therefore, the matter is going on in court
 raajnneeti ke lihaaj se ye mudda mahatvapurn he kyonki bijepi pehle dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahi thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main usne ye maang band kar di or yahaan tak baat ho gai ki bijepi apana menifesto bhi nahin laa pai kyonki is maang par bijepi main hi matbhed ho gaye the
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to the Urban Development Ministry of Delhi and asked him to prepare a feasibility report on how a referendum can be held to give Delhi full statehood
 yaad rahe ki kejariwal is saal farvari main jaise hi siem bane the unhone apni pehali mulaaqaat main hi piem narendra modi ke saath ke mudda uthaaya tha
 Also, in many meetings with Kejriwal on behalf of the Home Minister, the issue of full state continued to arise
 tippaniyan Ever since Kejriwal has come into the government, he has been demanding more rights for himself as Delhi does not have full state status and hence it is not clear here today what are the rights of an elected government and an appointed LG
 And up to where
 isliye maamla court main chal rahaa he
 This issue is important from the political point of view as BJP was earlier demanding full statehood status to Delhi, but in the assembly elections 2015, it stopped demanding that even BJP could not bring its manifesto because There were differences within the BJP itself on this demand

 On the same day, Donald Trump's administration vetoed its first national security strategy and described India as a "top global force and a stronger strategic and defense partner" and called China a "rival"
 Made an announcement

 piele ke salaahkaaron ne south china morning post ko bataaya ki iskaa makasad ''hind mahaasaagar kshetra main (china ke) badhate samudr-paar hiton kii hifaazat karnaa" he
 The announcement came at a time when the Trump administration outlined a plan to strongly oppose China's rapidly growing influence and presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and asia-pacific
 trump kii ranneeti main ''pratidwandvi takaton" ke taur par china or rus kii saaf-saaf pahchaan kii gai

 "the strategy has left untold how Washington will do this job, especially as many countries have been dragged deeper into China's economic circle in the first year of Trump's term

 In September, the PLA carried out the first live-fire drill at its new base in the Djibouti desert
 yah kavayad ahm thi kyonki yah 1979 main vietnam yuddh ke baad se piele kii pehali samudr-paar (sanyukt raashtra shanti abhiyaanon se alag) live-firing tainaati thi
 Matthew Dushatel, Senior Policy Fellow of the European Council on Foreign Relations, writes that the turning point behind this changed math in China and the recent spurt in activities to spread its footprint across the seas came in 2015, when tens of thousands of people in Libya and Yemen The PLA was engaged in the campaign to rescue and drive out thousands of Chinese citizens
 chini yojanakaaron or media reporton ke mutabik, jibooti ke baad do or ioaar addon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 China is said to have held initial talks with the Seychelles, while many Chinese observers believe that Gwadar would be a natural place in Pakistan
 iske alaava, srilanka or bangladesh main china bandargahon kaa nirmaan yaa dekhbhaal bhi kar rahaa he
 These developments, says Dushatel, show that China's foreign policy is undergoing tremendous changes and is moving away from its traditional policy of "non-intrusive" to "militarization" gradually

 The Outcome Budget of Delhi Government has been declared by the Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, as a juggler of figures

 By which the people of Delhi would know that the targets on which they had given the command of Delhi to the Aam Aadmi Party, to what extent and how far they have been achieved
 gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar ne badi chaalaaki se sari baat ko ghumaakar apane drushtikon se sari prastuti di
 In which the government presented only the Outcome Indicators and Output Indicators on the projects run by their own means and the work done on them, which was not the way to do the work done by the Government in the right perspective
 gupta ne kaha ki outkam bajet tabhi sarthak hota jab ise sarkaar apane sabhi chunavi vaayadon par pregentation eemaandaaree se detii
 Vijendra Gupta alleged that Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had constructed 500 schools, arranged 30 thousand additional beds in hospitals, built 1 thousand Aam Aadmi Clinics, opened Aam Aadmi Canteen in places, set up mohalla meetings, bought 2000 new buses
 , Did not give a presentation on the promises like making 50,000 women toilet and setting up wi-fi all over Delhi
 jabaki inhen vaayadon ke bare main chunaav se pehle hallaa machaa kar bade paimaane par yuvaaon or mahilaon ke vot hasil kiye gaye the
 But in the last 3 years nothing worked on it in the government, so all these things were missing from the Outcome Budget

 a new study has revealed that yawning or yawning is a sign of sexual attraction
 ab tak mana jaataa tha ki yah sone kii ichha ke prakatikaran kaa madhyam he
 At the first international yawning conference held in Paris, scientists claimed that this action of humans could actually reveal other emotions, including interest pressure and even a desire for sex

 Quoting Dutch educationist Walter Süntgens, who is considered an expert on yawning science, the newspaper said that we can send man to the moon but we cannot explain these activities in the slightest

 After which Councilor Kishanwati sent a defamation notice of Rs one crore crore to BJP Councilor Anita Tanwar for accusing her of taking bribe
 notice main kaha gaya he ki bijepi netaa turant unase likhit main maafee maangen yaa phir court main cese jhelane ke liye taiyaar rahen
 In fact, last month, both the councilors had gone to a surprise inspection of mid-day meal at a primary school
 jahaan donon ke bich jamkar bahes hui thi or ek duusare par aarope-pratyarope lagaae the
 Now Aam Aadmi Party councilor Kishanwati alleged that BJP councilor Anita Tanwar had falsely accused her of taking bribe in front of the media there
 unka kahana he ki is aarope se unki chhavi dhoomil hui he
 For this reason, they are forced to send a defamation notice of Rs 1 crore to the BJP councilor
 haalanki is dauraan bijepi parshad anitha tanvar se jab ajtak ne sawaal poocha to unhone jawaab dene main asamarthta jataai or kaha ki abhi tak unke paas notice nahin aayaa he
 'AAP MLA had also sent a notice of one crore, in fact, last month, Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Sangam Vihar and Deputy Chairman of Delhi Jal Board Dinesh Mohania also sent a defamation notice of Rs 1 crore to a complainant

 BJP leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who has been in the limelight with the controversial statements, has once again made a controversial statement
 unhone kaha ki koi musalmaan videshi nahin he, bharat ke sabhi muslmaan ram ke vanshaj hai
 Giriraj Singh said, 'no Muslim is a descendant of Babur inside India, no Muslim is a foreigner
 hindustan kaa musalmaan ram kaa vanshaj he, hamaare purvaj ek hai, puja paddati alag ho sakati he
 Giriraj did not stop here, he targeted AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and called him a breaker of the country
 unhone kaha, 'wo to makka madina jaaenge, ham kahaan jaaenge? kya pakistan main ram mandir banegaa? ovaisi jaise log, jinke dil main jinna kaa jinn pravesh kar gaya he, desh ko todna chaahate hai
 'this is not the first time Giriraj Singh has described Muslims as descendants of Lord Ram
 isse pehle bhi wo kai baar ye baat doharaa chuke hai ki hindu or muslim donon ke purvaj ek hi hai
 Both are descendants of Rama
 haal ke dinon kii baat karen to unhone november 2017 main kaha tha ki muslim alag nahin hai
 The ancestors of him and Hindus are the same - Lord Rama
 vahiin, beete 4 farvari ko unhone kaha ki bharat ke andar koi bhi babar kii aulad nahin he
 Here all Rama's children are from the family of Rama
 agar main dharm parivartan kar luun to kya mere bacchon ke, aane vaali pidiyon ke purvaj badal jaaenge
 They will remain Hindus

 Sheila Dixit, who was the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 years continuously, again got the command of the State Congress in 2019
 aaj bhi dilli main congress ke baaki netaaon main unki sweekaaryata zyada dikhti thi
 This is the reason that despite being 81 years old, Sheila Dixit became necessary for the Congress in Delhi
 unki khaasiyat yah bhi thi ki vah apane faislon se kabhi peeche nahin hatin
 Whether it was the matter of contesting elections with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi during Lok Sabha elections 2019 or taking a decision while being Chief Minister, Sheela never backed down from the decision she once made
 It is true that 2013 Sheila Dixit had to face defeat from Arvind Kejriwal of Aam Aadmi Party in the Delhi assembly elections
 yah bhi sach he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shila dikshit ko bijepi pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne haraa diya, phir bhi congress ke liye shila dikshit ke yogadan ko bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa kyonki vah congress ko itnaa vot share dilaa gayi ki party duusare number par pahunch gai
 In Delhi, in which the Congress got 8 seats in 2013 in the 2013 assembly elections and in the next election only this number reached zero
 jis dilli main loksabhaa chunaav 2014 or 2019 main bhi sabhi siten janata ne centre main sattadhari bijepi kii jholii main daal di
 Under the leadership of Sheila Dixit, the Congress sent the ruling Aam Aadmi Party to the third position in the same Lok Sabha elections in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and in most of the areas, even forfeited bail
 dilli kii sabase chaheti CM raheen shila dikshit ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan coment karenshila dikshit hi thim jo 2019 ke lok sabha chunaav main arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan ke khilaaf majbootee se dati raheen
 When the results were out, it was known how correct his decision was
 shila dikshit kaa maananaa rahaa ki agar congress AAP ke saath dilli main chunavi samjhauta karti he to use dilli kii maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar kaa shikaar hona padegaa
 She proved to be 100 percent right
 tamaam mushkilon ke baavjood shila dikshit aagaamee dilli vidhansabha ke chunaavon ke liye jor-shor se juty hui thim
 Sheila Dixit was constantly battling not only with the leaders of the opposition party but also senior leaders of the Congress
 shila dikshit or dilli prabharee pisi chaako kaa jhagada to aakhir tak khatm nahin hi ho sakaa
 On one side, she was struggling with her health and on the other, with the letters of Chako, in charge of Delhi
 vaise chaako kii chitthiyon se beparwaah shila dikshit apane tareeke se congress ko majboot karne main lagi raheen
 He had also appointed district heads according to his calculations
 yah baat alag he ki dilli congress prabharee pisi chaako aakhir tak shila dikshit ko patr likhte rahe
 In most of the letters, there was talk of reversing the decisions of Sheila Dixit and the new order
 haal ke ek patr main pisi chaako ne shila dikshit se kaha tha ki unki tabiyat thik nahin rahati, isliye vah kaaryakari adhyakshon ko faisle lene den
 It is clear that Sheila Dixit may have been making a strategy to strengthen the Congress till the last moment, but regrets will never be implemented
 afsos to pisi chaako ko bhi hoga hi ki ab vah shila dikshit ko koi patr nahin likh paaenge
 The government has recommended an inquiry under the Visakha Committee against an officer of Chhattisgarh's Kikondgaonki district panchayat
 unpar aarope he ki wo apane adhinsth mahila karmchaariyon ko watsap par massej bhej kar unhen pareshaan kiya karte the
 Three women workers under him have accused him of this
 mahilaon kaa kahana he ki manaa karne ke baad bhi wo unhen lagaataar massej bhejte the
 After this allegation, he was immediately transferred and attached to the ministry
 vahiin kondagaanv jila panchayat adhikari ke mutabik unpar jo aarope lagaae ja rahe hai, wo bebuniyaad hai
 He said that these women employees were negligent in government work, due to which they have been issued SCN several times

 com / i5prort5n8 england daure ke ekmaatr tii-20 match main team india jiti hui baaji haar gai
 After the defeat, some fans on Twitter are blaming captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, as he did not deliberately take a single in the last over, showing extreme self-belief
 bharat ko jeet ke liye aakhri do gendon par paanch ran banane the
 Dhoni struck strongly on the fifth ball
 single kaa puraa mauka hone ke baavjood vah ran lene ke liye nahin daude or duusare chor par khadey ambati rayudu ko waapas bhej diya
 Now Dhoni had to score six on the last ball to win, which he could not do
 agar rayudu strike par aate to aakhri gend par unhen chaukaa jamaana hota
 Due to this 'superstition', Dhoni is being criticized a lot on social media
 lekin unhone is 'vivaadaaspad' faisle kaa bachaav kiya he
 Dhoni said that he was able to middle the ball while Rayudu was unable to do it, so he thought it better to strike himself
 a captain who doesn't trust his teammates to deliver does not deserve to be captain # Dhoni— The Bad Doctor (@doctoratlarge)september 7, 2014I guess Dhoni should now do all the batting and bowling for the entire team as well, and use the other players only as fielders— The Bad Doctor (@doctoratlarge)september 7, 2014dhoni refused "singles" because he is married
 - Fun With Hashtags (@funwithhashtag) September 7, 2014 However, the Indian captain admitted that he missed at least two chances to hit the boundary in the last over
 dhoni ne 18 gend main naabad 27 ran banaae lekin aakhri do overon main khud strike rakhane ke liye kam se kam teen baar ek ran nahin liya
 During this time there was no tail batsman at the other end, specialist batsman Ambati Rayudu, who scored a half-century in the last ODI was present
 kai baar chijen aapke paksh main nahin jaatin: dhonaapane faisle kaa bachaav karte hue dhoni ne kaha, ‘antim over main maine kam se kam do aise shot ganvaae jin par main boundry jad saktaa tha
 It was a difficult task and it was one of those days when things did not go in your favor
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe laga ki gend mere balle ke bich main aa rahi he isliye mujhe jimmedaari uthaani chahie lekin aisa nahin hua
 Rayudu came at the same time he could not 'middle' the balls he played, so i thought i had to take responsibility
 ’dhoni ne kaha, ‘kul milakar hamane lakshya kaa acchhee tarah peechha kiya lekin hamane aakhri overon main kaaphi ran de die jabaki bich ke overon main hamane acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 England captain Eoin Morgan said that he had patience during the match which led to the victory
 england kii ore se 32 gend main 71 ran kii pari khelkar main of da match bane morgan ne kaha, ‘puure match ke dauraan khilaadiyon ne dhairya banaae rakhaa
 We got a good score and later the bowlers bowled brilliantly

 He said that Kovind hails from Koli community in Kanpur

 unhone kaha- 'ramnath kovind bahut hi yogya vyakti hai
 He is completely right for this position
 vah pichhadi jati se aate hai or hoicourt or supreme court main vakil bhi rah chuke hai
 Only anti-dalit people will oppose him

 varun gandhi ko pramod mahajan 2004 ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan bhaajapa main laae the
 Announcing this, he had joked, "half the Congress is with us and half with them
" '' asal main gandhi upnaam hi yuva varun kaa euaspy he
 However, one of his conditions in the BJP was that he would not campaign against his Tai Sonia Gandhi and brother-in-law Rahul Priyanka
 lekin ve apni tai kaa majaak udaane se baj nahin aae
 In a press conference called to announce his joining the BJP, he said that although he has a speech written but he will not read it, "otherwise you will think that i am a reader (reader), not a leader (leader)
" '' jaahir he yah tai sonia par kataaksh tha jo sansad main likhaa bhaashan padhane ke liye jaani jaati hai
 Mahajan later joked that since he read his speech, he is the real Gandhi
 firoz varun kii bahan priyanka ke saath khaasi atmiyata thi
 On many public occasions, many pictures will be seen of Priyanka in the lap of little Varun, especially on the birth anniversary of Indira Gandhi
 isliye priyanka ke dhikkaar se unka man sabase adhik aahat hua hoga
 But Priyanka, who is following Buddhism, must have been equally hurt
 lekin sonia or rahul gandhi ne varun par hamalaa na karne kii saavdhaanee barti
 Whereas the fiery Maneka never hesitated to attack Sonia
 donon kii tulana ke bare main menka aksar patrakaron se kahatee, ''aap ise do bahuon kii ladaai mat kahie
 Where is the comparison between us ve pehali baar saansad banakar ai hai or main chah baar mantri rah chuki hum
 "it was in 2001 that Maneka was removed from the post of culture minister
" tab kii afvaahon ke mutabik menka ko jab hataaya gaya to unhone iske liye sonia ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He claimed that Vajpayee removed him to please the Congress president, as he needed the support of the Congress to pass several bills in Parliament
 menka ne sibiai ko kaig kii ek report saunpi thi, jisamen ijnsie main kosh ke ghotaale kii khabar thi, jab sonia isaki adhyaksh hua karatin
 While Rahul was contesting his first election from Amethi in 2004, Varun visited Uttar Pradesh but did not go towards the Gandhi family stronghold
 lekin bhaajapa netritv is mukhar yuva se khaasaa prabhavit ho chukaa tha
 Mahajan told his friends that "it remembers all history
" '' varun kii na sirf yaaddaasht acchhee he balki unka adhyayan bhi kaaphi he
 Mahajan used them in the 2004 Maharashtra assembly election campaign
 varun chaahate the ki bhaajapa unhen usee tarah aage badaye, jaise congress unke bhai rahul ko badha rahi thi
 The day he became eligible to contest, he wanted the BJP to field him in the Vidisha by-election
 lekin tab tak bhaajapa kaa is yuva se moh bhang ho chukaa tha, jo apane bare main khaasi khushrahemiyaan paale hue tha
 According to party sources, LK Advani wanted to join Varun and make him party secretary but the offer was turned down as Varun wanted to become general secretary according to sources
 lekin adwani ke man main varun ke liye naram konaa he
 Probably because Varun is a nerd like him and keeps quoting topical writers in his speeches
 varun ko paay hi khan market kii aaleeshaan coffee shop main kaaphi pite or raajnneeti par bahes karte dekha ja saktaa he

 Tejpal was not tolerated to take off the turban
 unhone kadaa virodh jataayaa, tab qatari main lagane diya gaya

 On the issue of rhetoric in the UP assembly elections and the question of the BJP not fielding a single Muslim candidate, Union Minister Gadkari has said that politics should not be done in the name of caste and religion
 unhone kaha ki hamaara agenda rajya kaa vikaas karnaa he or ham desh ke garibi dur karnaa chaahate hai
 Read Nitin Gadkari's entire conversation with Aaj Tak
 sawaal- rahul gandhi or akhilesh kehete hai ki aap log nafrat kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai, dhruvikaran kii koshish kar rahe hai?jawaab- ham aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf hai, musalamaanon ke khilaaf nahin or naa hi ham daliton ke khilaaf hai
 We do not want to spread hatred nor do politics on the basis of caste and religion
 ham kisi ko ladaana nahin chaahate
 It is our goal to remove poverty from the country and we are running similar schemes
 sawaal- rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki ab modi ji kii awaz chuuhe jaisi ho gayi he?jawaab- jo chunaav harata he, wo apana sanyam kho detaa he
 Rahul and Akhilesh's alliance is under compulsion
 mulaayam khud nahin chaahate the ki gathbandhan ho
 But when Akhilesh finds out that he is losing, then he has taken the crutches of the Congress, whoever has taken the crutches of the Congress, the Congress is submerged, the companion is also submerged
 sawaal- mayawati ne amit shah ko sabase bada aatankwaadi kaha he?jawaab- janata ne mayawati ko bhi dekh liya, unhone bhi garibi dur nahin kii or jab koi chunaav harata he to bhashaa par sanyam kho detaa he
 In such a situation, the loser should be pardoned while keeping a big heart in politics
 sawaal- rahul gandhi kaa hamalaa sidhe piem modi par hota he or kaaphi tikhaa hota he?jawaab- dekhiye modi ji sirf bijepi ke netaa nahin balki desh ke pradhanmantri hai
 Nehru ji, Indira ji, Rajiv ji, Chandrashekhar ji, Morarji Desai, Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh were the pms of the country, then our party respected the dignity of the PMM
 bada durbhaagya he, hamaare piem modi ne duniya main bharat kaa gaurav badhaayaa he or unke bare main aisi ochhi baaten karnaa vipakshiyon ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 In such a situation, the people who are doing such petty things for the PM, they are destroying whatever little respect the public has about them
 sawaal- virdohi kah rahe hai ki isaki kya vajah he ki pradhanmantri vikaas kii baat karte-karte shmashaan or kabristaan aa gaye?jawaab- piem kii baat ko galat samajha gaya
 Electricity, small road, cemetery should be the talk of everyone in the election, PM said about it
 kisi jati yaa sampradaay kii taraf unka rukh nahin tha
 But SP, Congress and BSP deliberately want to win the election by dissolving it in the poison of religion and caste
 in virdohi dalon kii raajnneeti hameshaa se hi jati or dharm ke aadhaar par baantkar chali he
 Question- BJP does not have face in UP, will there be loss or not? Answer- No loss of any kind is going to happen due to lack of face
 raab ne kaha ki hiraasat, sambhavit durvyavhaar or sanchaar thap hone kaa mudda unhone bhartiya videsh mantri ke saath uthaaya

 bhartiya khel praadhikaran ke diji jiji thamsan kehete hai ki ham list kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 We will shorten this list and send it to the ministry in a week's time aakhri faisalaa lenge
 There are other reasons for concern for Indian sports officials
 agar bhartiya boxing sangh ke chunaav vakt par nahin hue to Indian boxers may stay out of the Asiad

 agar cricket team inchiyan jaati to hamen khushi hoti
 We do not fund cricket
 lekin, iskaa matlab ye nahin ki ham cricket ko asian khelon main badhaava nahin den

 BJP suffered due to the displeasure of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh's Kairana and Nurpur by-elections
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main puure 'ganna land' main bijepi camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Taking a lesson from the defeat in the by-elections, the Modi government has made arrangements to make the sugarcane farmers happy, so that its kingship in the sugarcane land of UP will continue in 2019
 kairana upachunaav main thokar lagane ke baad centre kii modi sarkaar kii ankhen khuleen
 The government has announced a huge relief to the sugarcane farmers and to pay their dues of 20 thousand crores
 saath hi sarkaar ne chini se niryaat kar bhi hataa diya he
 Making several announcements of relief for sugarcane farmers, said that a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugarcane will be created
 ol india kisaan sangharsh samiti ne sarkaar kii ore se liye gaye faisle par kaha ki in sab ke peeche kairana kaa asar he
 Uttar Pradesh is the largest producing state of India
 ganna land main pashchimi upi se lekar purvanchal or madhya upi kaa kshetra shaamil he
 Western UP is called the sugarcane bowl
 bagpat, kairana, mujffarnagar, saharanpur, bijanour, meerut, muradabad, gajiabad, amroha, aligarh, lakhimpur khiri, sitapur, shahjahanpur, barabanki, hardoi, faijabad, gorakhpur, kushinagar, maharajaganj, devaria, baliya or mau sahit kareeb 40 loksabhaa siten hai jo ganna land ke daayre main aati hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP and allies won 73 out of 80 seats in UP
 ganna land kii to sabhi siten bijepi ke naam rahi
 But the defeat of the Kairana seat has forced the BJP to think
 modi sarkaar ke ganna kisaanon par meharbaanike peeche makasad 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav mana ja rahaa he
 Resentment among farmers is increasing with BJP and opposition is united against Modi
 aise main modi sarkaar ne ganna kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne or unke dil main phir se jagah banane ke liye masterstroke chalaa he
 Through this, the BJP hopes that once again its magic will remain in the sugarcane land
 darasal kairana upachunaav ke samay ganna kaa mudda bahut jor-shor se uchhaala gaya tha
 Which was also supported by many opposition parties
 unke mutabik ganna se jude desh bhar ke kisaanon kaa kareeb 20 hajaar karod kaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Political experts believe that one of the main reasons for bjp's defeat in Kairana by-election was the non-payment of sugarcane farmers' money
 bataa den ki upi ke ganna kisaanon kii badahaali jagajaahir he
 Sugarcane farmers of the state owe Rs 13 thousand crore to the sugar mills
 jabaki yogi sarkaar ke ganna mantri suresh rana kairana loksabhaa kshetra se aane vaali thanabhavan vidhansabha seat se vidhayak hai
 Despite this, the sugarcane farmers have to face trouble for payment
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pashchim upi ke bagpat main kairana upachunaav main matdaan se ek din pehle ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan kii baat kahi thi
 Apart from this, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had assured farmers payment within 14 days at Shamli rally
 par kisaanon kaa dil nahin pighla or bijepi ummidavaar mriganka singh ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 rld's Tabassum won from this seat
 ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan ke liye modi sarkaar kaa ye kadam sirf upi hi nahin balki maharashtra main bhi raajnneetik phayda dilaa saktaa he
 UP is the largest producer of sugarcane, as it is estimated at 145
 39 million ton ganne kaa utpaadan karata he, jo akhil bhartiya utpaadan kaa 41
 28 percent
 iske baad maharashtra 72
 The second place with an estimated production of 26 million tonnes, that is 20 of the all India sugarcane production
 52 pratishat he
 Both Congress and NCP are together
 bijepi is kadam se pichley chunavi nateezon ko doharaana chaahati he
 Karnataka comes after Maharashtra
 karnataka 34
 It comes in third place with 48 million tonnes of sugarcane production, which is about 11 percent of the country's total sugarcane production
 rajya main kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa ek bada mudda tha
 The Congress and the JDS combine and hold power
 aise main is saath ko maat dene ke liye ye sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Tamil Nadu is the fourth largest producer of sugarcane, which is 26

 ahmedabad dhamaakon ke silsile main police ko tawqir kii talash he
 Abu Bashir, Sajid Mansoori and Tauqeer
 teenon ve aatankwaadi hai, jinhone 26 july ko ahmedabad ko dhamaakon se tharra diya tha
 a dreadful conspiracy was hatched to shake Surat
 or jinka haath bangalore or jaipur ke dhamaakon main bhi hone kii ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 Abu Bashir and Sajid are now under police custody
 gujarat police kaa daawa he ki abu bashir ne apana gunaah kabool kar liya he
 Meanwhile, clashes continue from different parts of Rajasthan
 savaimadhopur or kota jaise ilaakon main police ke haath suraagon ke taar lagaataar lag rahe hai
 The Chief Minister of Rajasthan has also claimed that the police have found many more clues related to the blasts
 dhamaakon kii sajeesh ke teen ahm taron main do to police ke haath lag chuke hai
 The third wire Tauqir from Mumbai is still free
 tawqir vahi shaks he, jisapar bam banane kaa aarope he
 According to the police, it was Tauqir who sent an e-mail to the name of Indian Mujahideen from the IP address of American citizen Ken Haywood to several news channels
 ek ke baad ek judati kadiyon se ummid banati ja rahi he ki bahut jald na sirf tawqir bhi shikanje main hoga, balki dehshat kii is khaufnak saazish kaa mukammal khulaasa bhi ho jayega

 However, garbage is sold near the street street
 sarkari daftaron ke galiyare daagdar hai, duusari ore nijee offis complex kii saaf-suthri seedhiyaan mobile par batiyaane kaa pasandida thikaana hai
 Cleanliness campaigns are hailed, but the issue of cleanliness goes beyond the call of volunteering and makes cleanliness a problem like power, education, health, which are unmatched by the stubborn shortage of infrastructure
 shaharon main ab saaf or gandi imaaraten, aspataal or saarvajanik sthal ek saath dikhte hai or yah fark logon kii ichhashakti se nahin balki suvidhaon kii aapurti se aayaa he
 Cleanliness is the last in the government's responsibilities, so public places with government management are smelly, while sanitation in privately managed public places is a natural part of daily functioning
 kya khub hota ki aam logon ko jhaadu uthaane ke protsaahan ke saath, karmchaariyon kii kami, kachra prabandhan kii chunautiyon, buniyadi dhaanche ke abhaav or sansadhano ke intjaam kii charchaa bhi shuru hoti, jiske bina safai kaa sirf dikhaava hi ho saktaa he
 It is important to remember the story of Surat because the hollow symbolism of the cleanliness campaign rings out after knowing it
 1994 main plig failane ke baad gujarat ke surat shahar kaa puraa prashasan hi nae sire se gadha gaya tha
 Deployment of supervisors by dividing the city into six zones and 52 sanitary districts, new staff for round-the-clock sanitation, construction of large scale facilities, use of private companies in waste management, strict daily monitoring and plague after illegal construction is banned Became the cleanest city in India in 18 months
 97 fisadi kachra vyavasthit dhang se sangrah kiya jane laga
 Why was this Gujarat model not mentioned during the latest cleanliness events? There was a huge investment in changing the 'surat' of Surat, the administration changed its habits and later it was linked to public participation
 sadaken buhaarti chhaviyon kaa daur khatm hote hi gandagi apni jagah mustaid dikhne lagati he, kyonki nagarpalikaon main prati din lagbhag 1
 More than 1
5 million tonnes of waste is released and according to the 12th Five Year Plan, there is no provision of solid waste disposal in India
 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar, class van or tu shaharon main 80 fisadi sivej kaa treetment nahin hota
 The 2011 census reported that 37 percent of the houses in cities are connected by open drains while 18 percent of the households have water flowing on the road
 barsaati pani sanbhaalane ke liye 80 fisadi sadakon ke saath drenez nahin he
 The Eicher Ahluwalia Committee had assessed that five lakh crore rupees to build sewage, solid waste management and rainwater drains in cities
 kii jarurat he
 Can any volunteering be an option for this huge need for resources? It is important to note that the matter of cleaning the cities has already started, even the brick of sanitation infrastructure has not been laid in the villages
 kachra or gandagi badhati aabaadi kii anivaary buraai he isliye safai aitihaasik taur par yudhstareey chunauti he
 New York in 1894 was so dirty that Theodore Roosevelt, then head of the New York Police Commission (later to become America's 26th president), did not agree to take over the city's cleanliness
 unki salaah par neuyork ke meyar wiliam strang ne purv karnal or sena main ghudsawaari daston ke visheshgy jorge vering ko city clining department kaa jimmaa saunpa
 Colonel Waring's war against the dirt was full of controversies, various kinds of rigor and heavy expenditure
 lekin 1898 main jab ve cuba main sanitessan kaa jimmaa lene ke liye ravaanaa hue tab tak neuyork kaa cheharaa badal chukaa tha
 Experiences in various cities of the world show that sanitation, sewage and waste management are daily battles that take huge resources and people
 isamen koi motaa phayda nahin hota isliye nijee nivesh bhi simit rahata he
 Administration of local bodies is the axis of daily cleanliness but the municipal bodies in India are the most impoverished and poor part of the administrative structure
 edibi ke teen saal puraane adhyayan ke mutabik, nagar nikaayon kaa rajasav jidipi kii tulana main sirf 0
 54 percent
 desh ke kul kar sangrah main inkaa hissaa dashakon se 1
 Is stable at 7 per cent
 1992 main 74wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke baavjood nagar nikaayon ko na adhikaar mili or na hi rajasav strot
 Thus, the maintenance of the municipal bodies of the country was Rs 22,649 crore against the requirement
 kam kharch karte hai
 To improve their financial health, cleanliness campaigns will be seen only on TV
 achraj nahin ki surat nagarpalika aaj bhi apni website ke jariye adhikariyon ke field work, safai or kachra sangrah kaa masik byoraa, shikaayat nivaaran kii jaankaree detii he
 Jan Jagriti Abhiyan is the last in preference because Shramdaan can make Gandhi platform a expressway
 bharat main lambey or safal abhiyaanon main sirf polio unmoolan najar aata he
 However, it took 15 years to cure this disease by delivering the medicine to children once or twice a year
 rojaanaa safai kii chunauti isaki tulana main bahut badi or mahangi he
 Therefore, the motives of cleanliness are as stubborn as questions like head, but inadequate facilities, scarcity of resources, poor municipal bodies, garbage cannot be removed by stealing

 India topped Pool b after defeating Zimbabwe by six wickets in the last league match

 com / gr5b76exji stadium main viru hi viru After four phases of Lok Sabha election 2019, out of the total 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, now 41 seats are from Awadh and Purvanchal areas
 pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi ke purv adhyaksh rajnath singh, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kii siten isi kshetra main he
 In such a situation, the area of awadh-purvanchal has turned into a political battleground
 inhen ilaakon kii siton kii jimmedaari congress main priyanka gandhi ke kandhon par he
 In such a situation, Priyanka is playing on the front-foot, which has intensified the war of supremacy between SP-BSP, Congress and BJP
 uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav ke abhi teen charan kii voting baaki he
 There are 41 seats in them
 2014 main do siten congress, ek seat sapa or baaki 39 siten bijepi ne jiti thi
 These seats are from Purvanchal and Awadh areas
 is ke baar ke siyaasi sangram main sapa-basapa gathbandhan, congress or bijepi teenon badi majbootee ke saath chunavi jang lard rahe hai
 Nobody wants to show themselves less than anyone
 congress mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha tha, 'uttar pradesh main congress ne chun -chunakar ummidavaar utaare hai, jo jeetenge yaa phir bijepi kaa vot kaatenge
 On the same day, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing an election rally in Barambaki, said that the key to remote control of BSP President Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is with Narendra Modi
 sapa-basapa par narendra modi dabaav daal sakate hai, lekin mujh par nahin he
 i am not afraid of Modi but he is afraid of us
 rahul-priyanka ke bayaan se sapa or basapa ke alaakaman bhadak gaye hai
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said that there is no difference between Congress and BJP
 congress kaa janata main koi aadhaar nahin he, isliye wo is tarah ke bahaanaa bana rahi he
 Congress is benefiting BJP by taking down its candidate
 akhilesh yadav ne rahul gandhi ke un aaropon ko bhi nakaarte hue kaha tha, 'hamen koi bhi niyantrit nahin karata he
 We are a political party
 yah sapa-basapa-areldi kaa gathbandhan he, jo uttar pradesh main sattadhari dal ko chunauti de rahaa he
 On the other hand, Mayawati also attacked the Congress and said that like the BJP, the Congress too has started to talk nonsense
 congress or bijepi ek hi thali ke chatte-batte hai
 These two are working to benefit each other
 akhilesh-mayawati ke bayaan ke baad ajtak ne priyanka gandhi ne shanivaar ko kaha ki 'main yah kah rahi hum ki main jaan de duungi lekin bijepi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye madad nahin karuungi
 i can never compromise with that destructive ideology
 kabhi nahin, puri jindagi main nahin
 Whatever candidates the Congress has fielded, they are fighting strongly or will win the vote of BJP, and no one else
 main is bare main bahut spasht hum
 In the political battle of awadh-purvanchal, there is a fierce fight between the SP-BSP alliance, Congress and BJP
 upi main hue chaar charnon chunaav main congress bhale hi mukhya mukaable main na dikhi ho, lekin baaki ke bache charan main party ke dedh darjan ummidavaar majbootee se lard rahe hai
 These include Lok Sabha seats like Dhaurahra, Barabanki, Sitapur, Rae Bareli, Amethi, Barabanki, Bahraich, Banda, Fatehpur, Sultanpur, Kushinagar, Salempur, Mirzapur, Pratapgarh, Bhadohi, Sant Kabir Nagar, Basti and Maharajganj
 isiilie priyanka ke bayaan par sapa-basapa ne palatwaar kiya he
 akhilesh-mayawati understands the fact that if not a counter-attack against the Congress, then the political battle of Purvanchal should not be confined between Priyanka vs Narendra Modi
 congress ne jis tarah kai siton par sapa-basapa se aae netaaon ko chunaav maidan main utarkar gathbandhan ke sameekaran ko pehle hi bigaad diya he
 That is why both akhilesh-mayawati leaders have become restless with the statements of Priyanka and Rahul
 haalanki congress ke candidet bijepi ke sameekaran ko bhi gadabada rahe hai
 During an event on August 15, Babulal Gaur caught hold of the Congress flag
 mangalvaar ko gaur ne bhale hi is maamle main safai di, lekin bijepi ne ise gambhir mana he
 At the same time, the Congress says that there was nothing wrong in this, about which a dispute is being raised
 maamla 15 agast kaa he jab bhopal mencongresske vidhayak aarif akil ke ek kaarykram main pradesh ke purv siem babulal gaur ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 Gaur was the chief guest of the program
 gaur ko swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene ke liye sammanit kiya gaya tha
 But something happened during the program, which nobody had imagined
 'majdoor se mukhyamantri BJP ne banaaya'kaarykram ke dauranbabulal gaur ne congress kaa jhanda thamaor baqayda use laharaaya bhi
 Babulal Gaur on Tuesday clarified the issue of holding the Congress flag
 unhone kaha ki wo ek kaarykram main gaye the, jahaan unka sammaan hua
 He was then asked to show the flag at the rally, then he showed it
 iskaa ye katai matlab naa nikaala jaae ki wo bijepi chhod rahe hai
 According to Gaur, he will stay in this party all his life because the party has made him a laborer to chief minister and has taken him from floor to hail
 aise main wo kahin or jane kii soch bhi nahin sakate
 The party is not trying to force Gaur: Gaur has been speaking on many issues against his own government since he was discharged from the Congress cabinet
 ab congress kaa jhanda thaamne kaa video aane ke baad pradesh kii raajnneeti main kai kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 At the same time, the Congress has made it clear that the Congress is not lashing them, but it is definitely standing with Gaur's ideology
 gaur ko dena hoga jawaab: bijepibabulal gaur kii safai kaa bijepi par koi asar nahin padaa he
 bjp's state vice president Rameshwar Sharma has taken a tough stance and has keenly sought answers

 lekin root ne puchhlle ballebaajon stuart broad (47) or anderson ke saath ardhashtakeey saajhedaariyaan karke tisare din kaa khel khatm hone tak england kii sthiti thodi behatar kar di
 The first and third sessions of the day were in the name of England and the second session was entirely from India
 ishanth kaa ab tak kaa sabase 'khatarnaak' spel!subah ke seshan main bhartiya gendbaajon ko koi wicket nahin mila lekin duusare seshan main ishanth ke khaufnak spel kii badaulat bharat ne 74 ran ke andar england ke chah wicket chatka die
 Some decisions, however, were also controversial

 Although the replay seemed like the ball had taken the edge of the bat but Australian umpire Bruce Oxenford had lost his finger
 robasan ne apni pari main 142 gend kheli or aath chauke lagaae
 Ian Bell opened the account with a four on the next ball but it did not affect Ishant, who was in full swing
 unhone behad khubasurat gend par balance ko elbeadblyoo out kiya or is baar kisi ko andeh nahin tha
 The innings of the balance was limited to 167 balls and 9 fours
 viketon kaa patan shuru ho gaya tha
 Ishant bowled England out with a dependable Bell (25)
 bel ne teji se uthati short pich gend par galat shot khilne ke prayaas main wicket ke peeche kaich thamaya
 Moin Ali (14) also fell victim to short pitch ball but this time the bowler was Shami
 gend ballebaaj ke dastaanon ko chuumati hui slip main shikhar dhawan ke paas pahunchi thi
 Bhuvneshwar then sent Matt Prior (5) and Ben Stokes (0) to the pavilion in one over

 However, this was not the case with Stokes and the ball was caught in Dhoni's gloves by taking the edge of his bat

 bhubaneshwar kii khubasurat inaswinger par haalanki broad puri tarah gachha kha gaye or pavilion laute
 Broad hit nine fours in his 42-ball innings and shared a 78-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Root
 bhubaneshwar ne iske baad liyaam plunket ko bold karke apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya
 In the same way that Bhuvneshwar and Shami shared 111 runs for the tenth wicket in the Indian innings, so far Anderson has given good support to Root
 in donon ne bharat kii england kii pari tisare din hi sametane kii ichha puri nahin hone di
 Root and Anderson have added 54 runs for the last wicket so far, with Shami taking two wickets for 98 runs to give India their first success as captain Alastair Cook yesterday

 After the Sukma attack, BSF jawan Pankaj Mishra questioned Home Minister Rajnath Singh in his video

 Pankaj wants to appeal in court through his lawyer
 unhen apni jaan kaa khatra he
 BSF jawans feel that by killing him, he will be shown suicide

 He says that Rajnath Singh did not even go to the martyrs' house
 haalankipradhanmantri modiki tarif karte hue pankaj kehete hai ki ab to ummid sirf modi se hi he ki wo dekhen ki unke javaanon par bade adhikari jurm dha rahe hai
 'jawans are considered big officers', says Pankaj, that most of the senior officers in the army consider the soldiers to be their servants
 unhone kaha, 'ham sena main desh seva ke liye gaye lekin philhal jo halaat he usamen shahid hone par parivaar ke liye sochane vaala koi nahin he
 Pankaj has alleged that after the video went viral, the senior officers of the army beat him and abused him
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe najarband kar diya gaya, lekin main vahaan se bhaag niklaa, kyonki mujhe nyaaypalika main bharosa he
 Separate commission should be made to investigate the matter so that milk becomes milk and water of water
 'bataa den ki sukama hamale ko lekar biguef jawan pankaj mishra ne apane video main grahamantri rajnath singh par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 This video of BSF jawan went viral

 Under his rule, the soldiers are eating sticks and getting martyred
 'bijepi ko nahin, modi ko diya vot'video main pradhanmantri modi kaa zikr karte hue pankaj kehete hai ki 'rajnath singh ji hamane aapako yaa bijepi ko vot nahin diya, modi ko vot diya he or aap jaise log pradhanmantri modi ko sahi sabit nahin hone de rahe hai
 "he says," Rajnath Singh gives wrong feedback to Modi and is the result of the mistakes of the jawan home minister killed in Sukma
 rajnath javaanon se apane juute pahante hai
 Targeting General VK Singh, Pankaj said, "he (VK Singh) even leaked his strategy that we are not in a position to fight with China
" phir bhi unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 He is still taking pension
 duusari taraf ham jaise jawan hai jo har haal main desh ke liye apni jaan ganvaa rahe hai
 In view of BSF jawan Pankaj Mishra's attitude, it would not be wrong to call him another Tejbahadur

 The terrorist attack on the batch of Amarnath pilgrims is being condemned in the country and the world
 somvaar shaam hue is hamale main 7 shraddhaluon kii maut ho gai or 19 yatri ghayal ho gaye
 While people are demanding retaliation from the government, a big flaw is coming from the security agencies
 khufia agenciyaan or rajya sarkaar is ghatana ke liye bas maalik or driver par hi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki amarnath yatra ke liye usne jaruri registration nahin karaayaa tha or na hi basasuraksha maanakonka paalan kar rahi thi
 This bus belonged to a private travel company in Gujarat, which has called these things a lie
 travel company ke maalik jawahar desai ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki driver ke saath-saath saare bhakton ke paas registration tha or ye kaagaj hamale ke baad bas main hi chhot gaye the
 Opening the claims of security agencies, he also showed all the documents to Aaj Tak and said that without registration, no one can go to see Baba Barfani
 aatankiyon ne do baar banaaya tha bas ko nishanabata den ki anantnag mechmarnath yatriyonki bas par aatankiyon ne ek baar nahin balki do baar hamalaa kiya tha
 a report sent to the Union Home Ministry by the Jammu and Kashmir government stated that two groups of terrorists attacked the bus with automatic rifles
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar kii do pannon kii report main likhaa he ki yah bas shaam chaar bajkar 40 minute par srinagar se jammu ke liye ravaanaa hui thi
 Upon reaching the Sangam area of anantnag, the driver told the passengers that the tire of the bus was punctured, which took about an hour to change
 iske baad bas jab aage badi, to 8:17 baje khanaabal ke paas us par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kar diya
 However, during this time the bus driver Salim Sheikh continued to run the bus without being nervous
 vahiin mahaj 75 gaj aage pahunchane par bas par aatankiyon ke duusare gut ne hamalaa kar diya
 The bravery of the bus driver did not stop the bus even after the salute bus driver took the passengers to the police station
 driver saleem shaikh kii is bahaduree kii sabhi tarif kar rahe hai or gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopani ne unhone veerta puraskaar dilaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Explain that the intelligence department had already issued an alert regarding the terrorist attack on the pilgrims for the Amarnath Yatra that began on June 29
 iske baad suraksha ke kade intazaam kar die gaye the
 Around 40 thousand security personnel were deployed to protect the passengers

 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan, who emerged as the largest party in the general elections of Pakistan, is currently being considered as the dearest of the country's powerful army
 lekin kareeb chah saal pehle unhone bayaan diya tha ki pakistan main sena ke din ab lad gaye hai
 Imran's party PTI has emerged as the largest party at a time when his rival parties and many commentators believe that the former cricketers have now become army fighters and the army is working behind the scenes to help them

 In an interview to news agency PTI during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland in 2012, Imran said, "army days are over, you will soon see a true democracy in Pakistan
" ’imran ke is bayaan ke baad jab pakistan main chunaav hue the to unki party PTI kuch hi siton par simat gai thi
 But in the results coming after Wednesday's election, his party seems to be performing brilliantly
 gauratlab he ki sena ke bare main imran kii raay main bhi ab bada badlaav aa gaya he
 In an interview to the US newspaper New York Times in May this year, Imran said, "this is Pakistan's army, not the enemy's army
" main sena ko apane saath lekar chaluungaa
 'since the independence of Pakistan in the year 1947, the army has been ruling there for almost half the time
 pakistan kii loktantric taur par chuni gai asainya sarkaron main bhi sena kaa dakhal rahaa he
 Changed attitude on India: Imran's opinion on India also seems to change now
 saal 2012 main imran bharat ke saath behtareen rishte chaahate the, lekin is baar ke chunaavon main unhone bharat par pakistani sena ko kamjor karne or purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif se milakar sajeesh rachane ke aarope lagaae
 After winning the current elections, Imran said that Pakistan is ready to improve relations with India and if India takes one step forward then it will take two steps forward
 unhone kashmir main maanavadhikaron ke kathith hanan kaa mudda uthaate hue kaha ki kashmiri logon ko takalif se guzarana pad rahaa he
 In an interview to the agency in Davos again in Davos in 2013, Rastaal had told that Imran had emphasized that the forces are not able to find solutions to bilateral problems of India and Pakistan
 unhone afsos jataayaa tha ki sangharshaviram ulanghan kii ghatnaon se shanti prakriya peeche ja rahi he
 At that time, Imran had said that India and Pakistan should resolve pending issues on their own and there should be continuous dialogue
 imran ne kaha tha, ‘dushmani bharat or pakistan ke logon ke hit main nahin he
 
 
 Ultimately, the solution is to be at the negotiating table and peaceful negotiations are needed to resolve the differences
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya bharat or pakistan kii senaaon ko sheersh str par or zyada sampark main rahanaa chahie, is par unhone kaha tha, ‘hamen majboot (raajnneetik) netritv kii jarurat he
 Issues with the army are not going to be resolved
 sena ke log raajnneetik samaadhaan talash paane main sakasham nahin hai
 'america's tissue paper is PAK Imran Khan said,' Ultimately only the leaders with big mandates can resolve the issues between the two countries
 ’us vakt imran ne kaha tha ki america, pakistan kaa istemaal ‘tissue paper’ ke taur par karata rahaa he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see how his attitude towards America
 saal 2012 kii apni daavos yatra main imran ne bhartiya vyapaar chambaron kii ore se yojit samarohon main hissaa liya tha jinamein bharat ke corporate or raajnneetik jagat ke netaaon ne bhi shirkat kii thi
 Imran also said that there is nothing wrong in talking to organizations like jamaat-ud-dawa in his political journey
 purv cricketer imran ne kaha tha, ‘agar main unhen (charampanthiyon) mukhyadhara main waapas lekar aauun to isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he or agar aap charampanthiyon kaa samarthan karne ke bare main baat karen to kya america ne taliban kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha?’satta main aane par bharat ke prati niti ke bare main puche jane par imran ne vaada kiya tha ki rishte saamaanya banane or vishwaas bahaali upayon ke liye tej kadam uthaae jaaenge
 In his recent statement, he has also emphasized on improving relations with India
