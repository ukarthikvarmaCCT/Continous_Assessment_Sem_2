 After the election was over, Bikram Singh Majithia filed a defamation case against Arvind Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh and Ashish Khaitan in the Amritsar district court
 cese main sunwaayee ab nirnaayak mode par thi or kejariwal ko ye ahsaas ho gaya ki is manahani ke cese kaa faisla unke khilaaf aa saktaa he
 After this Kejriwal wrote a letter to Bikram Singh Majithia and apologized

 Rajkumar Verka, spokesperson of Punjab Congress and MLA from Amritsar, said that it is now clear that AAP and Akali Dal are fixing matches in Punjab

 Will Kejriwal also apologize to Jaitley? The biggest case in the defamation case is Arvind Kejriwal vs Arun Jaitley

 The picture of both the leaders was quite discussed on social media
 gadakari ne bhi kiya tha manahani kesadelli siem ne 2014 main bijepi adhyaksh rahe nitin gadakari par bhi aarope lagaae the
 Kejriwal had released Gadkari's name in the list of most corrupt leaders
 jiske baad gadakari ne unpar manahani kaa cese daayar kiya tha
 In this case, the Magistrate Court had ruled against Kejriwal, after which Kejriwal reached Delhi High Court regarding the case
 haalanki, 2015 main kejariwal ne dilli hoicourt se maamla waapas le liya tha
 Why apologize? According to Aam Aadmi Party sources, Kejriwal will apologize to the leaders concerned in all the defamation cases going against him
 isi kram main kejariwal ne majithia se maafee maangi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that due to the court cases, the Chief Minister of Delhi is wasting a lot of time
 saath hi aam aadmi party or vyaktigat taur par mukhyamantri ke sansaadhan barbaad ho rahe hai

 Their uniforms have gathered dust thereby depriving them of right to education & a sense of normalcy

 On Monday itself, Mehbooba Mufti reacted strongly to PM Modi's speech at the 'howdy Modi' program
 unhone kaha tha ki aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki is faisle ko isliye liya gaya taaki jammu or kashmir ke "vishesh hiton" ko surakshit kiya ja sake, yah is desh kii vidambnaa he
 Happiness is being celebrated elsewhere in this decision, but the people of the state (jammu and Kashmir) are not happy with it, where it is expected to be the biggest beneficiary
 in sab ke bich bade unmaad kii madad se is puure nirnay ko sahi sabit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 He said before the removal of Article 370 that BJP should not play with fire when it is of special status in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone saath hi chetavanee di ki anuchhed 370 khatm karnaa, rajya kii bharat se aazaadee hogi
 Mehbooba Mufti said that if you free Jammu and Kashmir from Article 370, then you will also free the state from the country

 When you break this bridge, India will also lose its legitimacy on the state
 vah kabja karne vaali takat ban jayega
 The former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir was reacting to the bjp's manifesto, in which the party reiterated its commitment to abolish Article 370

 mahabuuba mufti (mehbooba Mufti News) ne kaha tha ki bhaajapa morchon par asafal hui he, chaahe vah berogari ho, kisaanon kaa mudda ho yaa mahangaai ho
 Now they are exploring issues which they can use to garner votes
 ' pidipi netaa ne chetavanee di ki bhaajapa ko aag se khilne se parhez karnaa chahie
 He had said that any change in the special status of the state could endanger the whole of South Asia
 unhone kaha tha ki jammu kashmir pehle hi visphotak ke dher par he or hamane uski jhalak pulavama main dekhi
 If the BJP does not stop making such statements and does not give up such intentions (about Article 370), it will burn not only Jammu and Kashmir but the entire region
 'unhone kaha tha ki isliye meri bhaajapa ko chetavanee he ki vah aag se khelnaa band kare
 There is explosive in Jammu Kashmir
 yadi aapane chingaari lagaai, sab kuch aag kii lapaton main hoga
 
 
 There will be no Jammu and Kashmir and India
 ' isse pehle mufti ne kaha tha ki anuchhed 370 samaapt hone par bhartiya samvidhan rajya main lagu nahin hoga
 He had a tweet why waste time in court
 bhaajapa dwaara anuchhed 370 samaapt karne kaa intjaar karen
 It will automatically stop us from contesting elections, because the Indian Constitution will not apply in Jammu and Kashmir

 mahaj 19 saal kii umr main film industry main kadam rakhane vaali divya bharti kam samay main hi yuvaaon ke dil kii dhadkan ban gai thim
 His beauty and tremendous acting fascinated the audience

 The matter reached the police
 police ne report main sharaab ke nashe main balakani se gir janaa hi maut kii vajah bataaya tha
 His death was, however, murdered by some
 jiskaa shaq unke pati sajid nadiadwala par tha
 Sajid was about to start the film 'ladla' at the time of Divya's death
 baad main us film main divya bharti kii jagah shridevi ne kaam kiya tha
 The case of Divya Bharti's death remained in discussions for several days

 The surprising thing is that the death of Divya Bharti, entangled between murder and suicide, is a puzzle even today

 Having the right justice will instill fear in the officers and they will be afraid of wrongdoing
 singh ne kaha ki ham isiilie lokapal kanoon bana rahe hai

 pichley maheene dilli sarkaar ne rajdhani ke imaamon kii tankhwaah badhaai, to ab baari uske naam par siyasat chamakaane kii aa gai he
 The Delhi Waqf Board called the Imams to read the Delhi Government's instructions, but instead many Imam salaries were still inverted due to insufficient
 gussa dekhte hue siem shila dikshit ne imaamon ko har saal badhotaree kaa bharosa dilaayaa, vahiin vakf board ke mukhiya matin ahamed ne bebaaki se kah diya ki agar phayda imaamon kaa he to congress ko siyaasi phayda kyon na mili
 The politics of Sheila Dixit is shining in the court of Imams
 haalanki ye koi siyaasi jalsa nahin he, phir bhi jab chunaav aane vaale hai or imam ek saath jute hai to siyaasi takreer honi bhi lajimi he
 Therefore, the Imams also did not say what to the opponents of Sheela from the stage

 But while shopping for marriage, Kush realizes that there is a love affair between him and his brother's fiancé
 teen saal pehle isi subject par diarector onir ne film 'sori bhai' banaai thi
 But Sorry Bhai


 was a film full of bold scenes while Writer Ali Zafar's 'mere Brother Ki Dulhan' is a light hearted romantic comedy
 yahaan bhartiya darshak bold subject kaa pressure mahasoos nahin karegaa
 Katrina's desire to grow slowly from one brother to another
 kahin koi jhatka nahin lagata
 Friendly Open Straightforward and Bindas Katrina's character has a good mix of naughtyness and innocence, which will make you see the film smiling
 yahaan 'maay nem iz khan' ke shahrukh kaa spoof bhi he
 Ali Zafar in the role of Sweet Sobar and Confused Bhai is impassive but why did he adopt a maleism like Dev Anand
 film main kuch kamiyaan bhi hai
 Some scenes are absolutely impractical and immaterial
 heroin hero kaa kidanap tak kar leti he
 The story is also slow
 or climex par jab lagata he ki film kaa di and ho gaya



 Even then the story keeps moving forward

 yadi corporate kshetra main lone kii maang sust ho to ham sasta lone kahaan se denge
 He indicated that at present, the scope of cutting interest rates for certain loans is very limited

 Bhattacharya also drew attention to the fierce competition in the retail market, which limits the scope for the loan interest rates to come down during the festive season

 Even the police did not understand how Vishal came here
 guuruuvaar ko pahchaan hui kilashvishaal kii he
 Vishal's family came to Ghaziabad on Thursday and identified Vishal
 rajasthan ke sikar kaa rahane vaala vishaal aakhri baar 2 may ko apane taaoo ke ghar dilli ke uttam nagar main tha
 It is alleged that on the last date, he took this girl of his neighborhood to Tau Suresh's house in Uttam Nagar area of delhi and said that both want to get married

 On 2 May, the girl's family reached Vishal's tau's house
 taaoo ke ghar pahunche ladki ke parivaar waalon ne kaha ki in donon kii shaadi nahin ho sakati
 He said that he is taking both Vishal and the girl along
 ve kuch der main vishaal ko hidaayat dekar waapas bhej denge
 but that did not happen
 vishaal kii laash 2 may ko hi der raat hai profile socity main aa gai
 Vishal's relatives allege that Vishal was murdered by the girl
 ye honor kiling kaa maamla he
 On April 29, Vishal ran away from home with his alleged girlfriend
 rajasthan police ko bhi is baat kii jaankaree di gai thi
 But suddenly in this way he went to Tau's house and went there with the girlfriend's family
 iske baad uski laash milane se kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kya hua
 The matter has also become complicated for the police
 rajasthanse dilli or phir upi ke gajiabad tak ke bich maut kii is story main asal main kya hua ye sab ab jaanch kaa vishay he
 The family of the girl is absconding that the girl's family is absconding
 jaanch ke liye rajasthan main bhi police ne team bheji he
 Vishal's corpse has been sent for the post-mortem
 lekin agar ye vaaki honor kiling kaa maamla he to ek baar phir saaf ho gaya he ki pyaar karne kii sajaa vishaal ko maut ke rup main di gai hai

 He said, according to information received from the control room, these workers were returning from Sandhurst Road station doing night duty
 aisa jaan padataa he ki shaayad ve chalati train ko nahin dekh paae kyonki us samay andhera tha
 'it is worth mentioning that earlier on November 3, 2013, four gangmen were killed by the speeding train going to Kolhapur between Thakurli and Kalyan railway stations in Thane district
 congress kaa aarope, notebandi kaa phayda uthaaya ajit dowaal ke bete nemanjit thakurgruuvaar ko congress mukhyalay main samvaadadaataaon se baat karne ke liye jairam ramesh aae to unke haath main ek parchaa tha
 Smiling Ramesh showed that paper and said that it is a 2011 report which is prepared by the National Security Advisor today
 jaahir he, vah ajit dowaal kaa zikr kar rahe the
 In that report, it was said that all the tax havens (such countries where there is a concession in taxes on investing in India) should be exposed to expose black money and also monitor these tax havens Should be done
 ramesh iske baad patrakaron kii taraf mukhaatib hue or bataaya ki vivek dowaal rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke bete hai or notebandi kii taarikh ke thik 13 din baad unhone ek jienvai-asia naam kii company gathit kii or is company ke jariye caiman island main dhan jamaa kiya
 However, depositing money in a tax haven is not illegal as per Indian laws
 par ramesh aage kuch tathy pesh karte hai
 "the data of investment in India from the tax havens like Cayman Islands makes some new signs
" san 2000 se 2017 ke bich kariban 8300 karod ru
 Was invested in the country
 lekin notebandi ke thik ek saal ke bheetar itani hi rakam kaa nivesh bharat main hua he
 Ramesh says the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should make public the details of investments from Cayman Islands to know which companies have invested so much in India
 congress netaa kaa kahana tha ki notebandi ke thik baad company kii sthapana or phir itani badi maatra main nivesh shaq paidaa karata he or aise main isaki sachaai baahar aadi chahie
 Ramesh further says that one of the two directors of gny-asia is Vivek Doval and the other is Don W
 ibanks hai
 His name is recorded in Paradise Papers and Panama Papers
 vah kehete hai, padosi desh pakistan main ek pradhanmantri ko panama papers main naam hone par jail kii hawa khaani padati he
 In such a situation, if the government talks about honesty, then the facts in this context should be brought forward
 ramesh ashanka jataate hue kehete hai ki is puure prakaran main paison ke roundtripping kii shaq ho rahaa he
 Accusing the BJP, Ramesh says, the son of leaders in this party has allegations of corruption
 chaahe vah abhishek singh hon, dushyant singh ho, anuraag singh ho yaa phir ajit dowaal ke donon bete
 Such questions may make the BJP uncomfortable just before the election
 khaskar, tab jab party agar khud ko bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khadi bataati he
 Everyone is now waiting for the bjp's cleanliness and facts from the government
 aamtaur par jab kisi nae hero kii pehali film hit ho jaati he tab uske paas 4 se 6 filmon kii line lagati he
 Then 2 to 3 films of that hero are released in the year, but this did not happen in the case of Jackie Shroff's son Tiger Shroff
 pehali film 'heropanti' kii safalata or tiger ko mili dher sari saraahna ke baad bhi tiger kii duusari film baagi do saalon baad arhi he
 After the success of Heropanti, Tiger also got many offers but Tiger decided not to hurry the decision, and despite being a hit actor, he has only 2 films
 darasal tiger samaj chuke hai ki kam kaam karo lekin acha kaam karo or yahi vajah he ki unke paas abhi sirf 2 filmein hai jinamein se ek film he baagi or duusari film he flying jatt
 The comments tiger kehete hai- main jaldbaazi nahin karnaa chahta
 i had quick success
 heropanti ji safalata ke baad industry ho yaa darshak sabaki ummiden mujhase bad gayi isliye maine soch samajhakar kadam rakhana behatar samajha
 i don't want to do something like that in a hurry
 maine soch samajhakar nirnay liya he or acchhee film or kahani kaa intazaar kiya he
 This is the reason why the second film is coming after 2 years
 main shukraguzaar hum meri film baagi ke nirmaataa sajid nadiadwala or nirdeshak sabir khan kaa jinhone ek or acchhee film kaa mujhe hissaa banaaya
 Let me tell you that along with the story characters in Bollywood these days, the most important is a big producer who markets the film well and releases well
 is maamle main tiger ne sahi raah chuni he
 Baghi is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala while Flying Jatt is produced by Ekta Kapoor
 heropanti kii safalataa ke baad tiger ke paas bhi kai ofer aae magar tiger ne faisla jaldbaazi main na lekar soch samajhakar nirnay liya or hit actor hone ke baad bhi unke paas keval 2 filmein hai 
 Actually Tiger has understood that do less work but do good work and that is why he has only 2 films out of which one is Baghi and the other one is Flying Jatt
 tippaniyan Tiger says- i don't want to rush
 mujhe jaldi safalataa mil gai
 After the success of Heropanti, the expectations of everyone, be it the industry or the audience, increased from me, so i thought it better to take a careful step
 main nahin chahta ki jaldbaazi main kuch aisa vaisaa kaam karun
 i have taken a conscious decision and have waited for a good film and a story
 yahi vajah he ki duusari film 2 saal baad aa rahi he
 i am thankful to Sajid Nadiadwala, the producer of my film Baghi and director Sabir Khan who made me a part of another good film
 aapako bataa den ki aajkal bollywood main kahani kirdaar ke saath saath sabase zyaada zaruri he ek aisa bada nirmaataa jo film ko acchhee tarah se market kare or acchhee tarah se release kare
 In this case, Tiger has chosen the right path

 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha he ki wo chathe number par ballebaaji karne ko taiyaar hai or is tarah unhone sanket diya ki unki team buudhvaar ko yahaan england ke khilaaf shuru ho rahe pehle test main paanch gendbaajon ko utaarne kii taiyaari main he
 On the eve of the opening Test of the five-match series, Dhoni said on Tuesday, 'I should be ready to bat at number six as this is the crucial stage in the match from where you can change the course of the match
 ' unhone kaha, 'agar aapako kuch boundry milani shuru ho jaati hai or anya ballebaajon ke saath aap sakaaratmak ballebaaji karte ho to acha he or match kaa yahi samay hota he jab aap teji se kuch ran bana sakate ho kyonki gend thodi puraani ho jaati he or gendbaaj thode thak jate hai
 But you have to make sure that you get a good start and the important thing is that you can benefit from it
 'dhoni ne kaha, 'aisi bahut kam timen hai jo paanch gendbaajon ke saath khelti hai
 Therefore, it is a big challenge in itself
 up mahadweep ke baahar paanch gendbaaj hona shandaar he or ham kal wicket dekhenge tabhi faisla karenge
 'this means that India can feed Stuart Binny as the all-round option at number seven
 gendbaaji-ballebaaji donon kar saktaa he binnijab is vikalp ke liye binni kaa naam bolaa gaya to dhoni ne thodaa ghumaakar jawaab diya
 Dhoni said, 'stuart is a player who can bowl a little bit and bat as well
 agar aap use achche maukey do or use aage badhaao to vah aisa khilaadi ban saktaa he jo hamaare liye agle chah-aath maheene tak badhiya khel dikhaa saktaa he
 He will not be as prolific as Jack Kallis but he will be a player who can bowl 10 overs and bat a little
 'paanch gendbaajon ko khilaane se bharat ko apane teen gendbaaj or ek spinner ke gendbaaji akraman main madad karne kaa mauka milegaa jise dakshin africa or newjiland main pareshaani hui thi
 The team had reached victory in Johannesburg and Auckland but could not register a win in these matches
 gendbaajon par daaromadardhoni ne kaha, 'hamen teen tej gendbaajon or ek spinner ke saath khelnaa padaa or agar pich oochaal nahin le rahi he to tej gendbaajon ko sanyukt rup se kaaphi jimmedaari uthaani padati he
 If you look in these Test matches, the fast bowlers bowled their best
 lekin kabhi kabhaar cricket main aapako thode bhagya kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 We need to give credit to the opposition team but overall i think the bowling department did well
 'jab dhoni se poocha gaya ki kya jahir khan kii anupasthiti ne gaiyr anbhavi gendbaaji akraman kii mushkilen badha di hai to unhone kaha, 'acchhee cheez he ki hamen yahaan halaaton se anukulit hone kaa thodaa samay mil gaya
 We worked a lot on fitness in the last 10-12 days
 ab ham aise charan se guzar rahe hai jahaan ham tej gendbaajon se thodaa bhaar kam kar rahe hai
 He said, 'they are bowling in the right field and that's the important thing
 overol ve achche dikh rahe hai
 Hopefully the players in our team do not suffer as much injuries as they did in 2011 in the previous series
 mujhe yaad he ki hamaare sheersh khilaadiyon ko nau yaa 10 ke kareeb chotein thim
 Ishant also praised Ishant Sharma
 bhartiya captain ne kaha, 'jahaan tak ishanth kii baat he to vah acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa he
 It is very important to get a good rhythm
 abhi tak vah acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa he or vah aisa khilaadi he jo hamaare kuch anya gendbaajon se zyada oochaal hasil kar saktaa he

 tamaam survey main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey trishanku hone kaa anumaan saamne aayaa he
 Now most bookies in Satta Bazar are also betting on the Trishunk assembly in Karnataka assembly elections

 It is worth noting that the betting market is an illegal market, where betting on the elections also plays a lot
 kai bookies kaa kahana he ki karnataka chunaav ke liye betting kaa dhandha kareeb 3,000 karod rupee tak pahunch saktaa he
 BJP will form the government with the help of JD (S)! Karnataka Assembly has 224 seats with 113 seats required for majority
 ek buki ne akhbaar se kaha, 'ham amit shah kii ranneetik kushalta par bharosa kar rahe hai or hamaara yah maananaa he ki devgauda kii jedy (es) kii madad se bijepi sarkaar bana legi, kyonki nattejey trishanku vidhansabha ke ho sakate hai
 The bjp's estimate of getting about 95 seats is a separate assessment of the Satta market

 This time also the bookie says that the BJP will not be able to cross the figure of 95 seats in Karnataka
 bijepi ke zyada se zyada 95 siten jeetne par daanv lag rahaa he to bookies is par bhi puure bharose ke saath daanv laga rahe hai ki use 80 se kam siten nahin milengi
 The JD (S) is betting on winning 20 seats and the bookies are confident that this party will support the BJP to form the government

 The Supreme Court will pronounce its verdict on April 24 on the plea of external Affairs Minister SM Krishna challenging the Lokayukta police investigation into a case of alleged involvement in illegal mining during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Karnataka
 nyaayamurti altamas kabir or nyaayamurti eses nijjar ne krishna ke khilaaf praathmiki par hone vaali kaarywahi par roak laga di thi
 After the Karnataka High Court refused to grant relief, the Supreme Court had earlier said on Krishna's plea, "we are inclined to stay the proceedings
" parinamswaroop, karnataka lokayukta ke aadesh par maamle main darj praathmiki ke aadhaar par hone vaali kaarywahi par roak lagi rahegi
 Krishna, in his petition, challenged the January 20 order of the High Court
 peeth ne kaha ki lokayukta police dwaara jaanch kaa aadesh ‘samaypurv’ tha, kyonki poorak report jamaa nahin hone ke kaaran lokayukta ke samaksh kaarywahi ‘adhuri’ thi
 The case of demonetisation has been referred by the Supreme Court to a bench of five judges and has stayed the hearing going on in various High Courts
 lekin sarkaar ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki court ne puraane noton ko aavashyak sevaaon me chalan kii seemaa badhaane se inkaar kar diya
 The court left it completely to the government and said that this government is the responsibility and the government should sensitively take appropriate decision on it

 All cases will be heard by the Supreme Court

 But the bad news for the government is that the demonetization case has been sent to the Constitution Bench of five judges for judicial review of the government's decision
 court ne 9 sawaal taiyaar kiye hai, jin par sanvaidhanik peeth sunwaayee karegi
 The bad news for the government is that during the first hearing, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had told the court that the court cannot review the government's decisions taken in financial matters
 par court ne sanvaidhanik bench bana kar maamle kii samiksha kaa aadesh de diya he
 On Friday morning, on behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibalne had requested the court to direct the government to extend the exemption of payment exemption from the old notes of 500 and 1000 for essential services, but the court left the decision to the government

 haryana ke panchkula hinsa maamle kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti kii team ne gurmeet ram rahim ke samadhi or purv congress vidhayak harminder singh jassi se saadhe paanch ghante tak poochtacha kii
 But even after this, SIT officials could not extract anything from Jassi
 police sutron ke mutabik purv congressharminder singh jassise kareeb teen darjan se zyada sawaal puche gaye jinka jawaab usne gol-mol diya
 During questioning, most of the questions were raised regarding Panchkula violence
 jassi se jo sawaal puche gaye unamem se kuch khaas prashn ye the-aap in dangon kii planning ke baaren main kya jaanate hai?25 agast ko gurmeet singh ko jab doshi qaraar diya gaya, to aap kaha par the?kin aropiyon ko aap pehle se jaanate ho, kiske sampark main aap rahe ho?kya aap kii sicyorti ke punjab police ke mulgim baba ke karcade main thi?kya aapane faraari ke samay haniprit kii madad kii he?kya dere se saamaan gaayab karne va sakshya mitaane main aap ne koi role play kiya he?sutron kii maane to jassi ne police ko bataaya ki vah 25 agast ko panchkula main the hi nahin
 Whereas according to the Punjab Police, on August 25, Punjab Police personnel were deployed along with Jassi
 police ab yah maan kar chal rahi he ki jassi gurmeet ram rahim ke kafile main shaamil to tha lekin vah kahin raste main idhar-udhar ho liye the
 According to police sources, the truth is being tested on the answers given by Harminder Singh Jassi in the interrogation conducted in Panchkula on Wednesday
 agar unke bayaan satyata se pare hue to unako dobaaraa poochtacha ke liye saman bheje jaaenge
 Police suspect that Harminder Singh Jassi sent police personnel posted on August 25 along with Gurmeet Ram Rahim under his protection
 haniprit kii faraari ke shuruaati dinon main jassi ke suraksha guard uske saath bhi dekhe gaye the
 It is also alleged that Jassi had taken Honeypreet Insa out of the dera under the guise of her z Plus security
 darasal, police yah bhi pataa lagaana chaahati he ki kya haniprit insa deraa se nakadi or jevaraat lekar baahar nikali thi to uskaa saath kisne diya tha
 And where is he hiding those precious things? haniprit or abhi tak faraar chal rahe doctor aditya insa kaa madadgaar kahin harminder singh jassi hi to nahin the
 On the other hand, Harminder Singh Jassi did not talk to the media when Panchkula came out of Sector 20 police station after questioning
 vah no coment kah kar chalate bane
 Now the question is arising whether Harminder Singh Jassi wants to hide anything
 kyonki isse pehle vah kai baar aaropon ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 But this time his lips were stitched
 ye sawaal bhi sir uthaa rahaa he ki kya harminder singh jassi police ke nirdesh ke mutabik media se baat karne se kataraa rahe hai
 Significantly, after Gurmeet Ram Rahim goes to jail, Jassi has seen a lot of interference in the dera management
 vah aksar gurmeet ram rahim ke bete jasmit insa or apni beti ke saath deraa parisar main dekhe gaye hai
 Sources even say that Jassi wants the dera to be commanded by Jasmeet Insa

 Rajasthan's caste equation: If there is a 10 percent vote bank of any caste in Rajasthan with a population of more than seven crore, then it proves to be enough to form and topple someone's government
 rajasthan main kul 272 jatiyaan hai
 Among these, 51 percent are Other Backward Classes (out of which 91 castes, Jat 9 percent, Gurjars 5 percent, Mali 4 percent), 18 percent Scheduled Castes (59 sub-castes of which Meghwat 6 percent, Bairwa 3 percent), 13 percent Scheduled Tribes
 (there are 12 sub-castes with Meena 7 per cent, Bhil 4 per cent) and 18 per cent others (brahmins 7 per cent, Rajput 6 per cent, Vaishya 4 per cent)

 loksabhaa chunaav ke bich electronic voting mashin (EVM) kaa mudda phir se garma gaya he
 The Trinamool Congress has received a setback on the charge of writing the party's name (BJP) with evm's election symbol 'kamal'
 chunaav ayog ne trinmul kii is shikaayat ko khaarij kar diya he
 Trinamool Congress general secretary Subrata Bakshi complained to the Election Commission on April 26 in this regard
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki pashchim bengal ke barrackpore sansadeey kshetra main iviem main bhartiya janata party ke chunaav chinh ke thik neeche party kaa naam (BJP) likhaa he
 BJP candidate Arjun Singh is from here
 is shikaayat ke baad shanivaar (27 april) ko dilli main congress or trinmul congress ke netaaon ke pratinidhimandal ne mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda se mulaakaat kii
 The delegation told the Election Commissioner that it is illegal to name the party with the symbol on the ballot paper and it should be investigated
 saath hi aane vaale charnon main ye iviem hatni chahien
 The complaint was made about this ballot paper
 The Election Commission, while replying to this complaint, has said that there is nothing on the ballot paper, which implies the name of the party (BJP) with Symbol (kamal)
 ayog ne yah bhi bataaya ki bhartiya janata party ke simbel main aakhri baar 2013 main badlaav kiya gaya tha
 The same design was then used in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki shanivaar ko chunaav ayukta se milane vaale pratinidhimandal main shaamil congress ke varisht netaa ahamed patel, abhishek manu singhvi or trinmul congress ke derek o bryan va dinesh trivedi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki 'camel' ke saath bijepi likhaa hua spasht dikhaai de rahaa he
 Congress spokesperson Singhvi had said that the name of the BJP in the EVM is clearly visible under its election symbol (lotus)
 jabaki duusari kisi party kaa naam chunaav chinh ke neeche nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 Singhvi also said that we have urged the Election Commission to remove such machines or ensure that the names of other parties are clearly visible on these machines
 barrackpore se trinmul congress ke ummidavaar dinesh trivedi ne daawa kiya ki yah janata ke saath spasht rup se dhokhaa he or iviem ko hack karne kii koshish he
 However, just one day before the fourth phase of polling, the bjp's symbol in the EVM, along with the party's name, the complaint being rejected by the Election Commission, is seen as a setback to the opposition's fight over evms

 jaipur main ek aisa muslim ilaaka he, jahaan par rajkeey sanskrit vidhyalay main 500 muslim bachche sanskrit padhate hai
 Like the Quran, he remembers Sanskrit verses on the tongue
 jaipur kii bhatta basti kaa sarkari rajkeey sanskrit vidhyalay he jahaan par keval muslim bachche padhate hai

 The parents themselves are happy with children's Sanskrit studies
 sanskrit ke teacher mahesh kumaar sharma ne kaha ki shuru-shuru main abhibhavakon main dar tha ki muslim bachche hai
 What will they do by studying Sanskrit, but when the school started getting good numbers, parents also started teaching Sanskrit to the children

 When the BJP leaders were agitating against the Muslims, the Muslim boys were stepping stones, but the people here say that the people outside spoil the atmosphere, there has never been any enmity between the language and religion

 Tikamgarh mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii ghoshnaa ke baad ab madhya pradesh ke tikamgarh jile ke vibhaajan kaa kaary sarkari taur par shuru ho gaya he
 The government is going to make Niwari Tehsil a new district and the Revenue Department has also started demanding claims and objections for it
 lekin, is vibhaajan ke saath virodh bhi tej ho gaya he
 The biggest protest is about Orchha, the princely state of the Ramraja government
 ise tikamgarh rajvansh kii aasthaa or tyaag kii nishaani ke taur par mana jaataa he, isliye yahaan logon ne orchha ko tikamgarh se juda nahin karne ko lekar andolan shuru kar diya he
 Four of the bjp's five mlas themselves are also surprised to see Orchha and Mohangarh tehsils remain part of Tikamgarh
 darasal, pichley dinon siem shivaraj singh jab niwadi aae the to unhone vahaan ke vidhayak anil jain ke kehane par niwadi ko pruthak jila banane kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Since then, the politics of the partition of two districts started intensifying
 haal hi main prashasan ne niwadi ko alag jila banaae jane kii prakriya shuru kar di
 Under this, preparations started to include Orchha, Mohangarh and Prithvipur tehsils with Niwari in Niwari district
 rajasav vibhaag is par daawey aapattiyaan maang rahaa he
 So the people there have started opposing this decision
 is bantwaare kii khilaafat ke liye orchha bachaao samiti kaa gathan kar virodh karne vaale pushpendra singh kehete hai, ye jilon kaa nahin dilon kaa bantwaaraa he
 CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who talks about Ramraj, is cutting the boundaries of the rule of the Ramaraja government
 tikamgarh kaa kshetrafal keval 5055 varg kilometre se ghatakar aadha ho jayega
 It is an injury to faith
 tikamgarh ke patrkaar ranjit singh parihaar kehete hai, tikamgarh orchha riyasat se pruthak ho jayega yah chaunkaane vaali baat he
 The politics of erasing the history of the sixteenth century
 jo bantwaaraa ho rahaa he vah bhautik str par bhi sahi nahin he, kyonki tikamgarh jile se kuch hi duuri par sthit mohangarh tehsil bhi niwadi jile main shaamil ho jaaegi
 For people here, the journey of the district will be increased from 14 km to 80 km
 kya he orchha kaa itihaas - baat solahavin sadi kii he
 Ganesh Kunar, the wife of King Madhukar Shah, came here from Ayodhya when he brought the idol of Lord Rama
 mandir main thodaa kaam shesh tha to unhone murti ko apane rajmahal main hi rakh liya
 After the temple was built, the idol did not arise when it was lifted from there
 iske baad rajmahal ko hi ramraaja sarkaar kaa mandir maan liya gaya or raja madhukar shah orchha kaa raaj unhen sonpakar tikamgarh chale gaye
 Since then, Tikamgarh and Orchha became historic
 yahaan di jaati he donon pahar kii salaamiramraaja sarkaar kii manyata puri duniya main hai
 There is a fair of domestic and foreign tourists here
 yahaan jitna prakritik saundarya he usase kahin adhik yahaan kii dharmik manyata bhi he
 Because, Orchha is the only place in the world where Lord Rama is considered to be a lively king
 yahaan pratidin sarkari police ke jawan aarti ke pehle donon samay salaami dete hai
 Also, on reaching Orchha, no salute is given to any ruler and administrator
 *** The Aam Aadmi Party is trying to capitalize on the success achieved in the Delhi Assembly elections in the Lok Sabha elections as well, but everything is not well in the party for the last few days
 pratyaashiyon kii ore se tikat lautaane ke saath hi kai anya muddon par kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi jagajaahir he
 At the same time, the names of Rajasthan candidates have also been added to the list of angry people
 khabar he ki pradesh main party ke kai bade netaa arvind kejariwal va anya netaaon se niraash chal rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, the AAP has fielded candidates for all 25 Lok Sabha seats, but three of them have left the field so far, while the rest are disappointed with the stance of the big party leaders
 pradesh ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki rajasthan main ab tak arvind kejariwal samet koi bhi bada netaa unke samarthan main prachaar karne nahin aayaa he
 The party's Lok Sabha candidate from Jaipur, Dr
 virendra singh rajya ke sabase bade savai maan singh aspataal ke adhikshak pad se viares lekar 'aap' ke tikat par maidan main hai
 But the party's big leaders are disappointed at not getting support
 kadi dhoop main 'aap' kaaryakartaaon ke sahare chunaav prachaar kar rahe virendra kaa chunaav prachaar bade netaaon ke nahin aane kii vajah se jor nahin pakad rahaa
 Virendra Singh says, 'if Kejriwal does not come then the situation will be a bit difficult
 yahaan har koi chahta he vah arvind kejariwal kii ek jhalak paae
 They are revolutionary
 unki kranti se hi prerana paakar hamane naukari chodi
 If Kejriwal comes, we will win this seat with good margins
 'gauratlab he ki pradesh main 25 main se teen loksabhaa kshetra jalor, baaraa-jhalawad, or ajmer se 'aap' pratyaashee ab tak maidan chhod chuke hai
 In baran-jhawar, the party candidate refused to contest the election, saying it was late in getting tickets, while the Ajmer candidate withdrew his name at the last moment
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bhaajapa ko mili chunavi haar ne uttarakhand main party kaaryakartaaon ke paune do saal ke intjaar ko aakhirkaar ek maukey main badal diya
 The wait was the appointment of office bearers of various corporations, councils and boards lying vacant
 in teenon rajyon main bhaajapa kii haar ke baad mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat 2019 ke liye sachet hue
 He came to the idea of removing the anger of the workers first
 vidhansabha chunaav nateezon ke mahaj 11 din baad yani 22 disambar ko ravat ne 14 pramukh kaaryakartaaon ko daayitv baant die
 The Chief Minister was assuming that with this step he would be able to indicate that he was serious about the interests and expectations of the workers, but he felt the reverse
 suchi jaise hi baahar ai, mukhyamantri par yah aarope laganaa shuru ho gaya ki unhone sirf apane karibiyon ko pad die hai
 There was a lot of controversy because there is no name of any MLA in it
 apane liye kursi kaa intjaar kar rahe vidhayakon ko jab suchi main sthaan nahin mila to unhone iske baad ke liye dabaav badhanaa shuru kar diya ki rajya sarkaar main mantriyon ke rikt do padon ko tatkaal bharaa jaae
 It is not easy for the Chief Minister to decide on this
 jaankaar maanate hai ki agar mukhyamantri ab ek-do rikt pad bharenge to jatigat or kshetreey samikarnon ko sadhana unke liye sabase badi chunauti ban sakati he
 In fact, till now, apart from the Chief Minister and the Speaker of the Assembly, four ministers are from Garhwal
 kumaun ke hisse main sirf chaar mantri pad aae hai
 Many senior legislators in both the circles are in the queue of ministers, who according to their stature have not received due consideration
 paanch baar ke vidhayak or purv pradesh adhyaksh rahe bishan singh chuphaal hon yaa aathvin baar ke vidhayak harvansh kapur yaa phir chaar baar ke vidhayak munna singh chouhan, purv cabinet mantri banshidhar bhagat yaa purv mantri balavant singh bhauryaal sabhi mantri pad paane kii jor-aajamaaish kar rahe hai
 BJP insiders say that some mlas are being considered for liability
 sarkaar ne jo daayitv suchi philhal nikaali he usamen andolankariyon ke sammaan ke liye bani andolankaaree sammaan parishad ke daayitv shaamil na kiye jane se andolankaaree is suchi kaa virodh karte najar aa rahe hai
 After becoming Chief Minister, Rawat was close to him
 es
 Panwar was appointed as Industrial Advisor and Naveen Baluni as Health Advisor while both were not considered to be more active in BJP
 iske alaava ity salaahkaar narendra singh bhi mukhyamantri hi kii pasand the
 The Chief Minister had also appointed Usha Negi as the Chairman of the Child Protection Commission despite opposition from party leaders
 ab pehali khep main jin 14 logon ko pad die gaye hai unamem andolankariyon main se koi naam na hone se bhi naaraazgi he
 One of the nominees named is Muslim leader Shamim Alam, while Deepti Rawat, a migrant Uttarakhandi, has also been included in this list
 do purv vidhayakon kaa naam is suchi main shaamil he
 Looking at this list, it is clear that the government's effort is to appease the workers who could not be given tickets and which are important to be used in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 is suchi main gadhwal or kumaun mandal vikaas nigamon ke adhyakshon kii ghoshnaa bhi vivaad kaa kaaran bani hui he
 On the one hand, the government has announced the integration of both the corporations and on the other hand, questions have also arisen due to the formation of their separate president
 jaateey santulan ke hisaab se is manonayan main thakur samaaj se paanch or brahman samaaj se teen daayitvadharee bane hai
 Only two Dalits have been given the chair
 thakuron main gajraj bisht, gyaan singh negi, mahavir rangarh, dipti ravat or shamsher singh satyal shaamil hai jabaki brahmanon main vijay badthwaal, mohan prasad thapalial, or kedaar joshi shaamil hai
 Kedar Joshi and Deepti Rawat are both migrants from Mumbai and Delhi, Uttarakhandi
 is prakaar pravaasiyon ko bhi pratinidhitiv mila he
 But the trick of the matter is that Rawat has missed a bit in showing mastery in this art of giving position and responsibility
 isi vajah se, pad hasil karne main naakaam rahe kaaryakartaaon main asantosh barkaraar he
 Those who have got a share in the cake of power are fine, but the disgruntled section can sabotage the preparations of the bjp's Lok Sabha

 Every rally of the BJP used to mention Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the first ancestor of the party and the founder of the Jana Sangh
 unke naare ‘puraa kashmir hamaara he’, kii hunkaar lagati thi
 Mukherjee, once a minister in the Nehru government, was of right-wing temperament and did not get along well with Nehru on the Kashmir issue
 pachaas ke dashak ke shuruyaat main jammu kashmir jane ke liye permit lene kii jarurat padati thi
 Apart from this, the flag and constitution of that state were also different
 mukherjee ne naaraa diya ki ek raashtra main do vidhaan, do nishaan nahin chal sakate
 He reached Kashmir without a permit and was arrested
 yahaan sandehaaspad paristhitayon main unki jail main mrityu ho gai

 Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal will be with him
 yah endie kii pehali raily hogi modi ko kaman saunpe jane ke baad
 In this, Narendra Modi will show the first glimpse of the changed aggressive hardcore strategy of BJP
 1996 ke baad se hi party ne apane un kor muddon ko kinare kar diya tha
 Due to which she became a force in the North Indian states
 jinaki badaulat jati se pare jaakar shahari matadaataaon ne uskaa samarthan shuru kiya tha
 These issues were the Ram temple, the abolition of the Uniform Civil Code i
e
 Section 370 and the elimination of state opposition in Kashmir
 magar phir party ko samaj aa gaya ki in muddon ke chalate samaajawaadee jahaaj se naav lekar utre ‘secular’ dal uske saath nahin aa paaenge
 There were some compromises for the sake of power and the family started growing
 badhate badhate 23 tak pahunch gaya or kor mudde kinare ho gaye
 But then when the tide descended and the account was on the verge of emptying, the BJP understood that the time had come to connect these old issues with national security
 narendra modi jab kashmir kii seemaa par is raily ko sambodhit karenge, to makasad sirf vahaan maujuud logon tak nahin, balki desh ke us kattar madhyavarg tak ye nayaa sandesh pahunchaana hoga
 It will be told that the issue of Kashmir is stuck with the inferior attitude of the Central Government
 isko paidaa karne vaale pandit nehru hai or unke vanshaj aaj tak ise sulajhane nahin de rahe
 It will talk about the militancy of the valley and the difficulties of the army deployed here
 yaad dilaayaa jayega ki bade aatankwaadi hamalon main kaise ghati ke ek khaas sampradaay se jude noujvaan pakade jate rahe hai
 These are the notes and tones that the BJP used to repeat everywhere after the Ram Mandir movement
 rajnatik pandit kitni bhi gardan ghumaayen, yah bhi satya he ki shaharon main bijepi inhen kade kattar se lagate tewaron ke chalate jagah banaati gai
 People felt that in the name of Muslim appeasement, governments were not showing strictness regarding the security system
 aaj ke halaat kii baat karen, to ram mandir kaa mudda janata ko lubhaane se rahaa
 Most have understood that everything will be fine only if your Ram stays fit
 aise main madhya varg do hi chijen chahta he
 One, a great economic environment, so that he gets a job
 tarakkee mili or desh kaa basic infrastracchar durust ho
 Roads should be spectacular
 bijli kii killat na ho
 The second important thing is a sense of security
 jab bhi aatankwaadi hamale hote hai, ye madhya varg kasmasaane lagata he
 He feels that the loose attitude of the government is responsible for all this
 in halaat main saamne aa rahe hai bijepi kii taraf se narendra modi
 On the economic front he has the Gujarat saga
 vah logon ko bataaenge ki gujarat kaise tarakkee kar rahaa he
 How are the roads there
 bijli kitni aati hai, kisaan kitne samrudh hai
 The matter of law will come on the other side
 chaha anchaaha sach yahi he ki gujarat dangon ke baad beete 11 barason main na to unke rajya main koi hinsa hui
 Nor a terrorist incident
 buddhijivi modi ke tareekon par ungali uthaate hai, magar shahari madhya varg is bahes main pade bina yahi doharaata he ki modi main aatankwaad se sakhti se ladane kaa madda he
 This leader of Gujarat realizes this
 tabhi centre sarkaar ke saath har meeting ke baad vah naksalwad or aatankwaad par garajte hai
 Lack of failures at the level of central government policy
 modi jaanate hai ki suraksha or vikaas, in do pahiyon ke sahare unki gaadi satta ke singh dwaar tak pahunch sakati he
 The bjp-led NDA is now a small family
 party mukhyalay ashok road par chal rahe ek taaja chutakle kii maane to chota parivaar or sukhi parivaar ho gaya he
 There are only two parties left in the alliance
 shivasena or akali dal(badal)
 Both are known for their radical mood swings
 unhen dharm ke raajnneeti main mail se koi gurej nahin
 This attitude of his was never acceptable to the BJP
 jinke chalate use secular hone kii topi pahanani padi thi, ve saath nahin rahe
 So it is certain that the BJP will now be seen in the same color manner as it looked in the era of Advani
 fark bas itnaa hoga ki tab adwani maharathi the or modi kochavaan, lekin ab adwani nepathy main honge or modi maharathi kii mudra main
 The country's prestigious Jawaharlal University is ready to elect its next student union president

 presidential dibet ke dauraan campus ke muddon ke alaava dhara 370 hataane or mob linching jaise mudde bhi chhaae rahe jiske jariye ummidavaaron ne apane virodhiyon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Presidential candidate Manish Jangid on behalf of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a student unit belonging to the Sangh and the BJP, began his address with slogans of 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' and 'vande Mataram'
 unhone apane virodhiyon par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jammu kashmir se dhara 370 hataae jane ke baad ek ore ham log jashn manaa rahe the to vahiin vampanthi vichaardhaara ke log sena ko gaaliyaan de rahe the
 He blamed the 'crumbling gang' for blaming treason on JNU
 manish ke bhaashan ke dauraan enesayuai or left sanghathanon ke chaatr lagaataar shor machaate rahe
 The issue of jobs to Lankesh, Presidential candidate for Congress-affiliated student organization NSUI, Prashant Kumar, while opposing Manish Jangid's statement on the sedition case, said that the matter is still in court and should not be politicized
 unhone apane bhaashan main modi sarkaar kii ore se 2 karod naukariyaan dene ke vaade kaa majaak udaate hue kaha ki aakhir naukariyaan kahaan hai? manish ne uniwarsity ke laapata chaatr najeeb kaa bhi mudda uthaaya
 After this, Ishi Ghosh, from the left unity, in her speech targeted the government on the killing of activists like Gauri Lankesh and Kalburgi
 adhyaksh pad kii ummidavaar aishi ghosh ne arthvyavastha se lekar mob linching ke mudde par centre kii bijepi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He accused of weakening the Right to Information Act and criticized the central government for implementing stringent laws like UAPA
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne kashmir ko barood ke dher par rakh diya he or vahaan maanavadhikaron kaa hanan kiya ja rahaa he
 Like this, Bapasa candidate Jitendra Suna appealed to his party to win this time, targeting the ideologies of both Right and Left
 kashmir ke halaat par chintajitendra kumaar ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi desh main dar kaa maahaul failaa rahi he
 He said that the Sangh and BJP are really anti-nationals
 chaatr rajd ummidavaar priyanka bharti ne saamaanya varg aarakshan die jane ke mudde par centre sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Accusing the privatization of education, he said that the government does not want to allow the backward and Dalits to study because our ignorance is the knowledge for them
 priyanka ne kaha ki sarkaar sirf kashmir kii jameen chaahati, log vahaan kii ladkiyaan lenaa chaahate hai, unhen kashmir kii awam se koi sarokaar nahin he

 VHP said, 'nothing wrong in returning home' The particular thing is that when he sold his bungalow, members of the same Hinduist organizations played the role of middlemen in the deal, who opposed him in the area

 logon ke bich hinsa, sankramak rogon or jalwaayu parivartan ne kareeb 4 hajaar saal pehle sindhu ghati yaa hadappa sabhyataa kaa khaatmaa karne main ek badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 This claim has been made in a new study
 north carolina sthit appalchian state uniwarsity main nrivigyaan (anthropology) kii associat professor dow
 Gwen Robbins Sug said in a statement that climate, economic and social changes all played a role in the process of urbanization and eradication of civilization, but little is known about how these changes affected the human population
 shodh-patr kii pramukh lekhak shug ne kaha, sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ant or maanav aabaadi kaa pun:sangathit hona lambey samay se vivaadit rahaa he
 This paper has been published in the journal Ploss One
 uniwarsity ne ek press vijyapti main kaha ki shug or anusandhankartaaon kii ek antarrashtriya team ne hadappa ke teen kabristaanon se praapt maanav kankal avasheshon main abhighaat (troma) or sankramak beemaari ke saboot kii jaanch kii
 Harappa was one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization
 press ko jari bayaan main kaha gaya ki unka vishleshan lambey samay se chale aa rahe in daavon ke vipareet he ki sindhu sabhyataa kaa vikaas shantipurna, sahyogaatmak or samtamulak samaaj ke rup main hua, jahaan koi saamaajik bhedbhaav, vargeekaran nahin tha or aadharbhoot sansadhano tak pahunch main koi pakshpaat nahin tha
 According to the analysis, some communities in Harappa have suffered more from climate change and socioeconomic damage than others, especially socially disadvantaged or marginalized people who are more vulnerable to violence and disease
 shug ne kaha ki purv ke adhyayanon main kaha gaya tha ki paristhitijanya kaarak patan kaa kaaran bane, lekin un siddhanton ko sabit karne ke liye koi sambandhit sakshya nahin tha
 In the last few years, existing technologies in this area have improved
 unhone kaha, jalwaayu parivartan ke ghatnakramon kaa maanav samudaayon par vyapak asar padataa he
 Scientists cannot predict that climate change will always have the same effect as violence and disease
 shug ne kaha, haalanki, is maamle main aisa prathit hota he ki sindhu shaharon main teji se hui nagarikaran kii prakriya, or vyapak saanskrithik sampark ne maanav aabaadi ke liye nai chunautiyaan khadi kar deen
 Infectious diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis were probably transmitted in a contact area, which spread to Central and South Asia
 shug ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki sindhu sabhyataa ke nagareey charan ke dauraan hadappa main kusht rog saamne aayaa, or samay ke saath yah failata gaya
 New diseases like tuberculosis also emerged at the end of Harappan civilization and after the phase of urbanization
 unhone kaha ki us samay khopadi main chot jaise nishaan hinsa kii ore ishaara karte hai or yah tathy kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Shug said evidence of violence in prehistoric South Asian sites generally is quite rare
 shug ne kaha ki adhyayan ke parinaam kaaphi jhakzor dene vaale hai, kyonki us samay hinsa or beemaari kii ucch dar ke chalate maanav aabaadi shaharon ko chhod rahi thi
 However, another interesting result is that the dead bodies were found to have the highest rates of violence and disease among those removed from formal cemeteries in the city
 shahar ke dakshin purv main ek chote kabristaan main purushon, mahilaon or bacchon ko ek chote se gadde main dafnaaya gaya tha
 The rate of violence in this sample was 50 percent and evidence of leprosy infection was found in more than 20 percent of these people
 shug ne kaha ki sindhu sabhyataa ke parinaam aadhunik samaaj par bhi lagu hai
 Researchers wrote, 'human populations in the semiarid regions of the world, including South Asia, are currently facing anomalous effects from global climate change

 ye shor abtak bijepi kii chunavi reliyon main nazar aata tha
 But now the same noise is being heard in exit polls of 3 states
 uttar pradesh ke agsit pole nateezon main to modi kai ilaakon main 800 fisadi tak siten badhaate dikh rahe hai or upi kii satta main bijepi kii dhamaakedaar tajposhi kaa sehara bhi unke sir bandhata dikh rahaa he
 This is perhaps the biggest strength of Prime Minister Modi, who took charge of the country in the fakery style, who has retained the magic of Modi name in the entire country as was shown in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 us vakt namo magic ne desh kii satta main 30 saal baad prachand bahumat vaali sarkaar banaai to aaj namo-namo kaa ye jaap un chunavi rajyon main bhi dikh rahaa he, jahaan agsit pole ke mutabik bijepi ko jabardast kamyaabi milti dikh rahi he
 Modi, who brought 71 BJP mps from UP to the Lok Sabha on the strength of his magic, also spoke in the assembly, at least this is what the exit poll results show
 india today exis maai india ke agsit pole main bijepi ko 251 se 279 seat milane kaa anumaan he, congress ke saath gathbandhan karne ke baavjood espi 88 se 112 seat tak simatati dikh rahi he to bispi ko mahaz 28 se 42 seat milane ke sanket mil rahe hai
 These results of the exit poll give a picture of the Modi wave going on in UP, because every party had its own face, its maharathi in UP elections
 lekin bijepi kaa iklauta cheharaa the pradhanmantri modi
 Prime Minister Modi was the only Maharathi of BJP
 piem modi kii bedaag chhavipiem modi kaa jaadu barkaraar rahane kii vajah bhi he
 The reason is his impeccable life
 isliye jab wo bhrashtachar or gundaraj ke khilaaf bolte hai to janata us par puraa-puraa yaqiin karti he
 The whole battle was against Modi vs Opposition and the exit poll results prove that in the war of UP, PM Modi single handedly heaped all the opposition
 upi ke sirf aakhri charan ne hi modi kii takat kaa puraa nazaaraa vipakshiyon ko de diya
 Before the last phase of voting, the magic of Modi is how the magic of Modi is speaking to the people, the hallmark of this is found only in one phase of marathon election campaign of UP
 8 march ko upi main saatven or aakhri charan kii 40 siton ke liye matdaan hue the
 For this, PM Modi camped in Varanasi for 3 days and see the picture Exit Poll is giving estimates on these 40 seats
 aakhri charan kii 40 siton par saal 2012 main bijepi ke khate main sirf 4 siten thim
 But this time the exit poll shows BJP getting 34 seats
 satta main rahete hue bhi samaajawaadee party piem modi ke aage chaaron khaane chit nazar ai
 In the exit poll estimate, the sp-congress alliance is reduced from 23 seats to just 1 seat
 ye modi ke sirf 3 din kaa kamaal he, jisane 40 siton par bijepi kaa kayakalp kar diya
 The seats increased by nearly 800 percent in one stroke
 itnaa hi nahin, agsit pole main to modi lahar ne to upi main bijepi ko itihaas kii sabase badi jeet kaa elaan kar diya he
 Since 1991, BJP has never got as many seats in UP as in the exit poll of 2017
 upi chunaav main bijepi kaa purana parformens1991- 221 seat1993- 177 seat1996- 174 seat2002- 88 seat2007- 51 seat2012- 47 sitmodi ke jis jaadu ke saath uttar pradesh kii janata ab sidhe judane ko betaab he
 Modi already realizes this
 isiilie wo is baat kaa shukriya bhi apane hi andaaz main pehle hi adaa kar chuke hai
 Riding on Modi wave in exit poll, BJP is moving towards historic victory, now the Chief Minister of UP wants to choose the same
 jo is lahar ko kaayam rakhe, piem modi ke vaayadon par khara utre

 BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has asked that why Nitish Kumar, who demanded strict action against black money and benami property, is unable to show courage to take action against both sons of Lalu, who created illegal property? Asked the question to Nitish, why are he compromising with his policy of zero tolerance against corruption? If Modi believes, Nitish himself is avoiding taking action against Lalu's sons for fear of falling the government and going to the chair and wants the central government to take action against him so that the snake also dies and the sticks do not break
 susheel modi ne nitish se poocha ki lalu or unke parivaar kaa patna main jo 750 karod kaa aaleeshaan mal ban rahaa he, vah paryaavaran kii niyamon kii dhajjiyaan udaate hue ban rahaa he
 Yet Nitish Kumar is not taking any action against him
 modi ne aage sawaal uthaaya kii MLA ko-oparative ke niyamon ko taakh par rakhkar lalu ne kareeb aadha darjan plot hathiyaa liya he, lekin iske baavjood bhi nitish kumaar koi kaarywahi nahin kar rahe hai
 Referring to the soil scam, Modi said that without any reason, the soil of Tejashwi Yadav's mall was spent in Patna's zoo and earned millions of income through it
 modi ne sawaal poocha ki is puure maamle ke ujagar hone ke baavjood bhi nitish kumaar ne tejasvi or tejpratap ke khilaaf koi karrwai kyon nahin kii?modi ne aage kaha ki swasthya mantri tej pratap yadav ne aurangabad main apane naam se kharidi gai karodon kii 45 dismil jameen ko ghoshnaptr main chupa liya
 But the Chief Minister has not been able to take any action so far
 gauratlab he ki susheel modi pichley 2 maheene se lalu or unke donon beton ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope laga rahe hai or unke dwaara yojit kii gai hajaaron karod rupee kii sampatti kaa dastavej ke saath saboot pesh kar rahe hai

 All hail # karunnair # indvseng # paytmtest # cricket # india # england There has been a decrease in the incidents of stone pelting in Jammu and Kashmir in the last one year
 algaavvaad se prabhavit is rajya main grahamantralay ke anusaar 2016 ke mukaable 2017 main patharbaji kii ghatnaayen kam hui hai
 This figure is significant because Kikendra Sircar's claim that the violence on the instigation of separatists in Kashmir has decreased after demonetisation
 grahamantralay dwaara rajya sabha main diya yah jawaab isaki pushti karata he
 According to the reply given by the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir to the Rajya Sabha, there were about 2808 stone pelting incidents in Jammu and Kashmir in 2016
 vahiin notebandi ke baad uske asar se 2017 main november takpattharbajeeki ghatnaayen lagbhag ek tihaai kam yani 1198 rah gayi
 In such a situation, the government claims that this was due to the ban on the funding of separatism due to demonetisation
 kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ne kaha ki rajya sabha main likhit sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue aage kaha ki vyavastha banaae rakhane ke liye central arm police force (capfs) ke javaanon kii paryaapt maatra main rajya main tainaati kii gai he
 These soldiers are helping the Jammu and Kashmir Police
 vahiin ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main ahir ne kaha ki suraksha kaarnon se javaanon kii tainaati asal sankhya bataai nahin ja sakati he
 Let us tell you that the central government has been continuously insisting that demonetisation has hurt the funding promoting terrorist and separatism in Kashmir
 isse pehle agast main vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main anudaan kii poorak maang par bahes kaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki, "2008 se 2010 tak hamane sadakon par hajaaron patharbaj dekhe
 In the last few months, there have been no more than 25-50 or 100 stone pelters on the roads
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah he ki aatankwaadiyon kaa vittaposhan ghat gaya he
 "jaitley said that, 'lack of funds to terrorists is a direct result of demonetisation
 yah na sirf kashmir ghati main ho rahaa he, yah chhattisgarh main bhi ho rahaa he
 ' desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua
