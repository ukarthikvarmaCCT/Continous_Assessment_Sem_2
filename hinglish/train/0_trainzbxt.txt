 Car companies, which are facing buyers' anger, are raining offers on new cars
 taaki kuch nuksaan jhelkar hi sahi kisi tarah se bikri ke girte aankade ko sambhala ja sake
 Car companies facing recession are very much looking forward to Indian market
 isliye lagaataar girti bikri ke baavjood companiyaan bharat main naye model launch karne se gurej nahin kar rahi
 But there is also a truth that to increase the sales of cars, car companies have to give huge discounts and offers to their existing models
 philhal car companiyon kii taraf se baari chhot ke ophers is prakaar hai:- maaruti wagon aar par 62 hajaar rupee ke ofer
 - 86 thousand rupees on s x 4 diesel
 - ritz par 51 hajaar rupee
 - General Motors is offering Rs
 33,000 to Rs
 66 thousand on almost all its cars
 - vahiin lagjri car company ne bhi apni kaaron ko aasaan kishton par pesh kiya he
 - And Volkswagen is offering 3 years free insurance and maintenance
 - vahiin kai companiyaan car kii booking karaane par lucky vinurs ko videsh main saiyr sapate kaa mauka bhi de rahi he
 However, industry experts also believe that such offers do not benefit the buyers
 piechdi chambar of commers ke idi saurabh sanyaal ke mutabik is tarah ke ophers main companiyaan pehle hi sab kuch jod leti hai
 Right now the condition of car companies is in trouble and in such a situation, the companies do not want to leave any chance to attract buyers
 lekin in ophers kii baadh main kharidaaron ko apni zarurat ke mutabik samajhadaari se faisla lene kii zarurat he

 desh ke sakal gharelu utpaada main kareeb 19 fisadi kaa yogadan karne vaale donon rajyon ke liye udyogon kaa mahatv kahin zyada he kyonki agar kaarkaane band hote hai to sthaneey logon ko uskaa khamiyaja bhogana padataa he
 The Congress is strongly promoting economic slowdown and wants to make an issue
 lekin vishleshak iske baavjood bhaajapa kaa palada baari maan rahe hai
 Industries are very important for both these states
 india brands equity foundation (ibief) ke mutabik, haryana desh ke sabase bade automobile hub main shumaar he kyonki yahaan par desh kii do tihaai kaaren, 50 fisadi tractor or 60 fisadi motorcycilen banati hai

 The Congress claims that the progress of Haryana and Maharashtra has taken place under the Congress rule
 ibief ke mutabik, maharashtra ne desh kii jidipi main 2017-18 ke dauraan 14
 The contribution has been 89 percent

 Mumbai is India's largest industrial city and is also becoming a global financial hub
 maharashtra main mukhyarup se iti, electronics, menufactoring industry kaa ek bada saamaajik or audyogic dhaancha karyrat he
 Senior Congress leader and former MP Sanjay Nirupam says that we are trying to bring the economic slowdown among the people to the public
 sarkaar ne vaada kiya tha ki do karod logon ko rojgaar diya jayega lekin rojgaar dene ke bajaay rojgaar chhin rahe hai
 Mumbai, which is the financial capital of India, we are trying to make it an issue
 lekin bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke log jaan boojhkar puri bahes ko 370 aadi muddon par lekar jane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Recession can become an issue if people are willing to listen to it
 nirupam kaa kahana he ki desh main do sabase zyada pragatisheel rajya hai haryana or maharashtra
 The first 15 years in both the places have been the Congress government
 donon infrastracchar or nivesh ke maamle main kaaphi aage nikal chuke hai
 Gurgaon became an IT hub in the Congress era today
 ye donon pradesh main aarthik mandi kii maar mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Actually, different regions have their own issues in Maharashtra
 kuch ilaakon main baadh to kuch main sookhaa
 There is also the issue of jungle cutting and bullet train in Aarey Colony in Mumbai
 kamaal ye bhi he ki kuch ilaake jo sookhe kii maar se peedit the ab barish se trast hai
 Problems with the weather have changed
 purv saansad or congress netaa sanjay nirupam kehete hai is baar baadh or sookhaa donon mudda rahenge
 The victims of the devastation caused by the drought have not yet received compensation
 isi bich barish ne kahar barapa diya
 Rainfall in Kolpahur, Pune and Solapur caused a lot of damage
 ham maanate hai ki barish prakritik aapadaa he
 The city of Mumbai was submerged four times
 lekin sawaal ye he ki barish kaa pani nikalne kaa rasta aapane band kyon kar diya
 Certainly public issues will become an election issue
 bhaajapa apane paanch saal ke kaamon par vot maang rahi he or rashtrawaad ke dharaatal par congress se zyada majboot dikhti he
 Political analyst Abhay Kumar Dubey says these recession and economic slowdown will not be an election issue
 bhaajapa aasaani se maharashtra or haryana kaa chunaav jeet jaaegi kyonki vahaan ke saamaajik sameekaran hai ve bhaajapa ke paksh main hai
 Elections are usually won on the basis of social equations, unless the economic condition is very bad
 abhi aarthik kshetra main samasya he, halaat kharaab jarur hai lekin itane bhi kharaab nahin hai ki wo chunaav parinaam ko ulat de
 Right now there are no big social movements against the Bharatiya Janata Party
 jab andolan chalate hai to koi saamaajik sameekaran kaam nahin aata
 There is Jat vs Non Jat in Haryana which is in favor of BJP
 maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena kaa gathbandhan majboot he
 Congress remains the number two force in both states
 baharhaal, matdaan hone main abhi teen hafte se zyada kaa vakt he or chunaav nateezon se pataa chalegaa ki aarthik mandi kaa maahaul in rajyon main koi chunavi asar chhod paata he yaa nahin
 *** uttar pradesh main do charnon kii voting ho chuki he or paanch charnon kii voting baaki he
 For these steps, strong leaders are addressing rallies to the parties and trying to influence more and more voters
 chote kaaryakarta sthaneey netaaon ke saath jansampark ke kaaryakramon main lage hue hai or votaron ko party nitiyaan samajhane main lage hue hai
 While the ruling party Samajwadi Party and Congress alliance are claiming victory in this election, BJP is seeing Modi wave this time and they too are sitting in the hope of returning to power
 is chunaav main teesri sabase badi takat bahujan samaaj party kii dikhaai de rahi he jisaki mukhiya mayawati roj reliyon ko madhyam se votaron ko party ke liye vot karne ko kah rahi he
 Amidst this entire electoral atmosphere, the most surprising thing is that Rahul Gandhi is addressing the most number of rallies on behalf of the Congress party
 samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan ke baad bhi sapa netaaon ke liye vot maangane ke liye sapa kii ore se kisi congress netaa ko bulaayaa nahin gaya
 Sources say that even though the Congress Party has listed many parties among the star campaigners to the Election Commission, only Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi have been sought for election campaigning from the ally Samajwadi Party candidates
 
 congress party ke sutron kaa kahana he ki priyanka wadra (gandhi) or sonia gandhi ke chunaav prachaar ko lekar abhi kuch tay nahin he
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party is not excited about the election campaign of the second line leaders in the Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa isliye bhi congress party ke netaaon se duuri banaae hue hai kyonki congress party ke netritv main centre main upie kaarykaal main kai ghotaale hue the
 At this time Samajwadi Party wants to stay away from tainted leaders of Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi sansad se lekar chunavi sabhaaon main upie sarkaar ke samay hue ghotaalon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai or yahaan tak kii purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi nishane par hai
 Therefore, the leaders of the Samajwadi Party do not want to bear the brunt of the Congress scams
 abhi tak yah dekha gaya he ki rahul gandhi ke baad congress kii ore se rajbabbar hi chunaav prachaar main zyada sakriy hai
 The comments abhi tak yah bhi dekha gaya he ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa to congress ummidavaaron ke liye vot maang rahe hai lekin congress ke ummidavaaron ke liye sirf congress netaa hi vot maang rahe hai or sapa netaaon ne unki jarurat mahasoos nahin kii he
 On behalf of the Congress, Salman Khurshid in Farrukhabad and Sriprakash Jaiswal in Kanpur are campaigning for their candidates
 vahiin, sabase aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki uttar pradesh main congress ke prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad bhi sapa ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar nahin kar rahe hai
 It is a different matter that Priyanka Gandhi was requested to campaign for the Samajwadi Party but Priyanka Gandhi has not yet gone to the state to appeal for the vote according to her schedule
 is asamanjas ko lekar samaajawaadee party ke netaa naaraaz bataae ja rahe he
 Explain that towards the SP regarding the propaganda of leaders of second line in the Congress like P
 Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal, Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma, Shakeel Ahmed, Sheela Dixit, Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Digvijay Singh, Manish Tiwari There is no demand from is puure chunavi maahaul ke bich sabase aashcharya karne vaali baat yah dikhaai de rahi he ki congress party kii ore se rahul gandhi hi sabase zyada reliyon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 Even after the alliance with the Samajwadi Party, no Congress leader was called by the SP to seek votes for the SP leaders
 sutron kaa kahana he ki star prachaarkon main congress party ne bhale hi kai partiyon kii suchi chunaav ayog ko di ho, lekin sahyogi dal samaajawaadee party ke pratyaashiyon kii ore se keval rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or priyanka gandhi ko chunaav prachaar ke liye maanga gaya he
 Sources in the Congress Party say that there is no definite decision regarding the campaigning of Priyanka Vadra (gandhi) and Sonia Gandhi
 vahiin congress main duusari qatari ke netaaon ke chunaav prachaar ko lekar samaajawaadee party utsahit nahin he
 It is believed that the Samajwadi Party leaders are also distancing themselves from the leaders of the Congress Party because many scams took place during the UPA tenure at the Center under the leadership of the Congress Party
 is samay samaajawaadee party congress ke daagi netaaon se dur rahanaa chaahati he
 It is believed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is targeting the scandals during the UPA government from Parliament to the election meetings and even former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also targeted
 isliye congress ke ghotaalon kaa khamiyaja samaajawaadee party ke netaa nahin bhugatna chaahate hai
 So far it has been seen that after Rahul Gandhi, Raj Babbar is more active in campaigning from Congress
 tippaniyan So far it has also been seen that Samajwadi Party leaders are seeking votes for Congress candidates but only Congress leaders are seeking votes for Congress candidates and SP leaders have not felt their need
 congress kii ore se farrukhabad main salmaan khurshid or kanpur main shriprakash jaiswal apane ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the most surprising thing is that Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, is also not campaigning for SP candidates
 yah alag baat he ki samaajawaadee party kii ore priyanka gandhi ko chunaav prachaar ke liye aagrah kiya gaya tha lekin priyanka gandhi abhi tak apane tay kaaryakramon ke hisaab se vot kii apil karne ke liye rajya main nahin gai he
 Samajwadi Party leaders are said to be angry about this confusion
 bataa den ki congress main duusari qatari ke netaaon pi chidambaram, kapil sibbal, ahamed patel, jairam ramesh, anand sharma, shakeel ahamed, shila dikshit, sachin payalat, jyotiraditya sindhiya, digvijay singh, manish tiwari jaise netaaon ke prachaar ko lekar sapa kii taraf se koi maang nahin he

 Anushka said, "I have a scene with him in this film but it is quite effective

 is film main ekatarfa prem kii kahani ko darshaya gaya he or yah 28 oktober ko relies hogi

 maharashtra navnirmaan sena (manase) ne is film kii relies par pratibandh laga diya tha

 Timur Lung was from the Shia sect

 It was named Tajiya

 On the one hand, while all the parties of the state are keeping a distance from their anger and loss in the eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Allahabad, to demand the implementation of three-tier reservation in the UP Public Service Commission examinations, Anupriya directly with her party Has jumped into this movement

" aarakshan samarthak andolan main kudakar anupriya inhen naaraaz jatiyon ko apni ore khinchne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 "apna Dal, a party with a strong presence in the Kurmi fraternity, particularly in Purvanchal, is trying to unite the backward and extremely backward castes angry with the SP and BSP

 He says, "since the formation of Akhilesh Yadav's government in the state, the sp's penetration among the backward and most backward castes has increased and smaller parties have become increasingly marginalized

 Everything changed after the untimely death of Sone Lal Patel in a road accident on October 17, 2009
 is ghatana ke 15 din pehle hi anupriya kaa vivaah lakhanu ke ek civil ejeeniyar ashish kumaar se hua tha
 Anupriya, the third of the four sisters, recovered from the shock of her father's death and attended the party's condolence on October 26, 2009 in Rabindralaya, Lucknow
 is maukey par anupriya ke bhaavnaatmak bhaashan ne party netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko is kadar prabhavit kiya ki sabhi ne ek swar se prastaav paarit kar unhen apana netaa chun liya
 The new Tevar Anupriya of the party is engaged in strengthening the organization
 unhone party ke tevar or taur-tareekon main bada badlaav kiya he
 In order to ensure uniformity in the party's statements, they send a letter to all the leaders on every issue and give official information about the party's strategy
 unki is ranneeti ke bare main bijepi ke varisht kurmi netaa santosh gangavar kehete hai, ''yah samay raajnneeti main badlaav kaa he
 Anupriya cannot proceed by capturing only one caste
 agar ve vaaki badlaav chaahati hai to unhen samaaj ke anya tabakon ko bhi apane saath jodpha hoga
 "anupriya may have realized these needs of politics and now she is trying to move forward by breaking the regional and ethnic beds of her party
" 17 aktubar ko sonelal patel kii punyatithi par mirzapur ke chaanbe vidhansabha kshetra man7 ek badi raily karke unhone purvanchal main apni dhamak dikhaa di
 On a constant call from Android activists to get updates from their activists and rally at the frenzied English-speaking Anupriya, slogans shouted: 'anupriya-anupriya-anupriya, a messiah of the poor and the backward
 'saamaajik nyaay kii yodghupana dal kii pahchaan bhale hi purvanchal ke kuch jilon main kurmi jati main paith rakhane vaale dal ke rup main ho, lekin anupriya patel pichhadaa, pasmanda or dalit bhagidaari par aadhaarit saamaajik nyaay or bhagidaari ke sidghant ko lekar aage bad rahi hai
 He has also reached out among the youth of Yadav caste

 She says, "in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat, the Chief Minister comes from backward classes
 baavjood iske uttar bharat main satta or isse jude kendron main pichhadon kaa pratinidhitiv behad kam he, jo raajnneeti kaa ek sankraman kaal he
 "women's empowerment is also high on Anupriya's agenda and she has been very vocal against female harassment
" aarakshan samarthakon ke saath khadey hokar anupriya ne yuvaaon ke bich bhi khaasi lokapriyata batori he
 Undoubtedly, Anupriya is emerging as a strong voice of marginalized people in Indian society

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got five percent or less votes in 38 of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 duusari 14 siton par use 10 fisadi yaa usase kam vot mili the
 Due to these figures, it was assumed that SP-BSP-RLD alliance will not have any significant effect this time by keeping Congress out of the state
 par priyanka gandhi ke siyasat main kadam rakhane ke saath hi congress paanch saal pehle kii tarah mahaj ek or party bhar nahin rah gai he
 The contest in this most important state of the country has become triangular in terms of elections
 kya is ticone mukaable ke natijatan vipakshi voton ke bant jane kaa phayda gaddinshin bhaajapa ko hoga? 2014 main uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan ke teen bhagidaaron kii jholii main kul milakar 42
 The vote was 7 per cent, while BJP 42
 3 fisadi vot hissedari ke dam par 71 siten jiti thim
 The votes polled by the Congress in such a close contest can prove to be decisive
 congress ke ummidavaaron kii suchi kii chaanbin karne par pataa chalata he ki party jahaan kuch siton par mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon main send laga sakati he, vahiin duusari siton par yah gathbandhan ko madad hi karegi
 For example, in Saharanpur, there is a tough fight between the two sides
 mahagathbandhan kii teenon partiyon ke netaaon—bahujan samaaj party (basapa) supremeo mayawati, samaajawaadee party (sapa) pramukh akhilesh yadav or rashtriya lokdal (ralod) ke mukhiya ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary—ne 7 april ko devband main jabardast raily kii
 Two days later in Priyanka's roadshow, a large crowd gathered in the same constituency
 congress or mahagathbandhan donon hi kaaphi had tak musalmaan voton ke bharose hai
 In Saharanpur, the Congress got 34 percent of the votes in 2014 and was second only to the BJP with 40 percent votes
 yah upi kii un nau alpsankhyak prabhutv vaali siton main se ek he jahaan party ne tagada muslim ummidavaar maidan main utarkar mahagathbandhan ko sidhi chunauti di he
 The remaining eight seats are Bijnor, Sitapur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Deoria, Farrukhabad, Badaun, Moradabad and Kheri
 congress ko ummid he ki vah in siton par muslim voton or bhaajapa se naaraaz maane ja rahe savarna voton ko apane paale main laakar gathbandhan ko peeche chhod degi
 The strategy of the Congress has been built around the upper castes in Uttar Pradesh
 ek adhyayan ke mutabik, rajya main oonchi jatiyon kii hissedari 19 fisadi he, par 44 fisadi vidhayak inhen jatiyon se aate hai
 Among the upper castes, Brahmins are said to be particularly angry with the BJP and their displeasure is due to the increasing dominance of Thakurs in the state administration
 hindu voton ko lubhaane ke liye congress ne aksar party adhyaksh rahul gandhi or bahan priyanka gandhi kii hindu or brahman pahchaan par jor diya he
 The Congress will benefit from the split in Muslim votes only when it is able to gain the support of Hindus
 centre for da study of develping societes kaa adhyayan bataata he ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab congress ne upi main 21 siten jiti thim tab party ko 25 fisadi muslim or 31 fisadi brahman vot mili the
 This time the possibility of Muslim votes being divided has made the Grand Alliance worry, so it makes sense
 isi vajah se mayawati kii saharanpur main musalamaanon se ekamusth gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ko vot dene kii apil par hairaani nahin hoti
 The SP has been avoiding the counterattack on the Congress's confrontational attitude
 basapa ne amethi or raibareli ko chhodkar un 15 nirvachan kshetron main se kai par tagade ummidavaar utaare hai jahaan congress jeet kii sambhaavna dekh rahi he
 One of these is Dhaurahra where the Muslim population is more than 20 percent
 basapa ne bhale aisa nahin kiya he, par sapa ne kanpur, unnav or kushinagar sareekhee kai siton par taqatvar ummidavaar utaarne se parhez kiya he or saajha dushman bhaajapa ke khilaaf congress ko jeet kaa behatar mauka muhaiyaa karaayaa he
 In return, the Congress has either fielded weak candidates or left the field vacant in the strong seats of SP and RLD in Azamgarh, Kannauj, Mainpuri, Baghpat and Muzaffarnagar
 iske alaava 50 ke aasapaas siton par congress ne sanghathan kii kharaab haalat ke chalate kamjor ummidavaar utaare hai jisase bhaajapa ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan ko madad milani chahie
 However, SP and BSP defectors are also among the Congress candidates, which Akhilesh and Mayawati may not have liked
 asal main upi main congress ke niskriy kaaryakartaaon ko jagaane kii priyanka kii ranneeti main duusari partiyaan chhodkar aane waalon ko shaamil karnaa bhi rahaa he
 Savitri Bai Phule and Ashok Kumar Doher of BJP, Kaiser Jahan of BSP and Nasimuddin Siddiqui and Rakesh Sachan of SP are some of such big leaders in the Congress's court
 50 ke aasapaas siton par congress ke kamjor hone ke kaaran bhaajapa or mahagathbandhan ke bich sidhaa muqabla hogacongress ko ummid he ki vah muslim prabhutvvali siton par muslim voton or bhaajapa se naaraaz maane ja rahe savarna voton ko apane paale main laakar gathbandhan ko peeche chhod degi
 The Uttar Pradesh unit of the Congress has demanded the Samajwadi Party (SP) government of the state that the Lokayukta has recommended to take further action by filing a case against the former senior ministers of the erstwhile government after investigation

 If you have done so this year, you will feel that during the time we were busy in the formation of the new government, we were busy celebrating the rise of the most brilliant leader of the decade, kiran-kejriwal's tu-tu-main-i Having fun and arguing over the planes allegedly flying between planets during the Vedic period, the structure of the economic and strategic power of this world changed in a very interesting way
 is saal ke dablyooef kaa agenda spasht taur par is badlaav ko dikhaa rahaa he
 As the WEF has been accused, instead of celebrating this capitalist splendor, a lot of questions arise here
 ye sawaal khud par bhi uthe or poonjeevaad par bhi
 This time there were so many panels on the inequality in the income distribution rather than on the rise, and on the negative effects of climate change in the economic boom years, that the very first morning i was forced to comment that it seems like my favorite poverty lovers Have captured Davos or may have come to this court
 is saal ke dablyooef ke kuch hisse aise the jinhen dekhakar aapako aisa lag saktaa he ki aap vishwa saamaajik manch (dablyoosef) main maujuud hon
 European scholars have a valid argument for this: Everyone hoped that the growth in the boom years might not benefit everyone equally, but substantial wealth would percolate downward, bringing prosperity to the general population

 Decadent economies, old-fashioned conflicts between uniformed forces (ukraine), global and domestic-funded Islamic terror (france and Belgium), Russia being seen as a demonic nation and on its southern edges (syria, Iraq and Turkey) and Africa The emergence of a demon called ISIS in the northern coastal areas in some parts of the world — this is a change in the balance of global power that has been achieved through photographs, pa Can be seen the same map and structure
 iskaa ek ahm nateeja yah hua he ki dablyooef bhumandalikaran ke jis buniyadi vichaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, use chunauti mili he
 Falling economies, debt traps, desperate populations and new threats to security have forced most European countries to think in their own privacy as isolated nations, something they had forgotten in decades of Europeanization

 yahaan tak ki iran ke dussahas ko bhi usase hawa milegi
 Conversely, the equation is reversed at $ 45 per barrel

 Maneka Gandhi said that he was an accused and he would have been hanged from court anyway
 unhone kaha ki aisa hone lage to phir phayda kya he kanoon kaa, phayda kya he system kaa
 Maneka said, "in this way there is no benefit of exchange and law, whoever wants to pick up a gun, who needs to be killed

 party pravaktaa prakaash javdekar ne kaha, 'ham modi par jairam ramesh kii bhaddi tippanee kii ninda karte hai
 This is very embarrassing
 ' Ramesh today attacked bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, saying that speaking on the Lokayukta is like 'asaram talking about brahmacharya'
 ' The Congress leader said this yesterday when asked questions about Modi's mocking of the Lokpal Bill during a rally in Uttarakhand by Modi
 aksar vivaadaaspad bayaan dene vaale gramin vikaas mantri ne modi kii tulana us asaram se kii he jin par yon hamale kaa aarope he
 Modi had questioned why the Congress, which emphasized the Lokpal Bill, is not implementing the Lokayukta Act enacted by the previous BJP government led by Bhuvanchand Khanduri in Uttarakhand
 ramesh ne us par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne das saal tak apane rajya main lokayukta niyukt nahin kiya
 He has no right to speak on the issue of anti-corruption legislation
 unhone kaha, 'jo vyakti 10 saal tak lokayukta kii niyukti nahin karata ab vah lokayukta par upadesh de rahe hai
 It is like Asaram talking about brahmacharya

 This was my biggest idiot
 in sab afvaahon kii vajah se main kaaphi chidchida mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 The new avatar of 'balika Vadhu', Haircut, appeared in this look Avikalekha but later i realized that this is all just a nonsense because there is nothing between me and Avika and we both know this
 avika mujhase bahut choti he
 Anyway, these kinds of things don't affect me anymore and now we mostly meet in connection with work
 avika bhi manish kii baat se sahmati rakhti hai or donon aapas main ek acchhee camestry shayr karte hai, jiskaa credit avika manish ke saath apni dosti or unke bich ke majboot bond ko detii hai
 On the rumor with Avikamnis openly speaking on the relationship, Avika says that Manish is only a few years younger than his father, so there is no scope for any such romantic relationship between them
 donon hi dosti kaa ek anoothaa bandhan share karte hai, jo baaki logon kii samaj se baahar he
 According to Avika, both of them are still together due to mutual understanding, respect for each other, honesty and bonding
 avika or manish kii baton se to yahi lagata he ki donon ke bich sach main kuch nahin he, lekin phens to unke bare main aisi atakaley lagaate hi rahenge

 Yes, it is a sight to promote Sinha in the local areas of Patna
 ve bade hi santosh ke saath is bheed ko apane samarthan ke rup main dekhte hai
 They wipe sweat from their foreheads and their convoy rises further to their destination
 dekhne par hi pataa chal jaataa he ki ve thodaa thak chuke hai lekin is behate paseene kaa mol ve bakhubi jaanate hai
 That's why he says, "I don't see any competition against myself here
" ''shatrughna sinha apni jansabhaon main bhrashtachariyon ko sangrakshan or garibon se jhuthe vaadon ke liye upie sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa karte hai
 Sinha is contesting from Patna Sahib parliamentary seat after delimitation on BJP ticket
 ise shahari jansankhya bahul sansadeey kshetra mana jaataa he
 Around 8 here
 85 lakh matadaata hai
 And these tall and powerful politicians, also known as Bihari Babu, seem confident that if they do not win the record then they will surely win a big victory
 ve daawa karte hai, ''meraa aadar or sweekaaryata isliye nahin he kyonki main ek film star hum
 i am always with my people every moment
 or isliye ve meraa saath dete rahe hai
 Now let's move the matter forward
 kuch hi kilometre kii duuri par diziner shart pahane ek khubasurat shaks is baat se katai sahamat nahin he
 It is Shekhar Suman who is the Congress candidate against Sinha
 apane patna sthit awaas par aaraam se baithe suman ne india today se kaha, ''yah sab shabdon kii baazeegari he
 Just ask Sinha how many hospitals were built or developed in Bihar during his tenure as Union Health Minister
 or jahajrani mantri rahane ke dauraan bhi unhone rajya ke liye kya kiya
 He cannot have any answer for this because he did not do anything
 '' suman aage kehete hai, ''jab desh ke anya hisson main jabardast aarthik vruddhi or sakaaraatmakataa kaa daur he, bihar hamen bharat ke pichde hone kii yaad dilaataa he
 We should show the way to those who have not lived up to their promises
 ''apni filmi haisiyat ko rajnatik takat main tabdeel karne ko lekar ve bhi sinha jitne vishwaas se labarej najar aate hai
 They think something and then a sudden sarcastic smile comes on their face and they say, "don't forget that my elder brother (shatrughan Sinha) has never won an election before but has lost an election
" 
 jabaki main to abhi shuruuaat hi kar rahaa hum
 "it is clear that they want to tease the pain of their opposition
 sanyog se, sinha kii loksabhaa main pravesh paane kii pehali koshish vyarth hi gai thi
 In 1992, he was defeated by Rajesh Khanna of Congress in the by-election for the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 laalkrishna adwani ke istipha dene ke baad is sansadeey kshetra ke liye loksabhaa chunaav hua tha
 It is no wonder that Suman's supporters are second to none in finding similarities
 ve bhi rajesh khanna kii tarah bollywood ke sitare hai
 His colleagues say, "history always repeats itself
 ''agar yuddh kaa pehla siddhant apane pratidwandvi kii kamiyon ko jaananaa or ujagar karnaa he to suman ne apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam diya he
 Not only this, if Sinha is the head of popularity here, Suman is not far behind
 iskaa udhaaharan google par suman ko lekar 0
 There are 1,92,000 search results in 27 seconds
 yah bhi koi hairat kii baat nahin ki in donon filmi hastiyon ke patna sahib se chunaav maidan main utarane se is loksabhaa seat ke nattejey sabaki dilchaspee kaa centre bane hue hai
 Of course, whether it is due to being a film personality or being political, Suman is drawing tremendous crowds which could not happen with many of his films
 suman daawa karte hai, ''jab sarvshereshth prashikshakon ko laga ki sicks pack banane kaa meraa samay guzar chukaa he, us samay maine yah karke dikhaaya
 i did three hours daily before the album came to market
 main dhun kaa pakkaa insaan hum
 "of course they can be but Sinha is not far behind
 sambhawatah kuch ziddee bhi
 That's why even before the party's official announcement, he had declared himself ready as a BJP candidate from Patna Sahib
 apane virodhiyon ko jhatka dete hue ve tikat hasil karne main safal bhi rahe
 Suman's election is also such a shocking incident
 congress ne isliye unhen patna sahib se utaara kyonki sinha kaa jawaab dene ke liye uske paas koi upyukt ummidavaar tha hi nahin
 But will it be good enough for Suman? Many people are thankful to this matter
 in logon kaa maananaa he ki suman ne us party se kariyar shuru kiya he jo bihar main pichley do dashak se ekadam niskriy he
 Suman himself may be weighty but he may have chosen the wrong time to go to the right party
 kuch vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki suman badlaav kii kisi majboot yojana ko pesh karne main asafal rahe hai or unhone congress or apni shakhsiyat par adhik bharosa jamaaya hua he
 Also they are not completely aggressive
 par suman vyangy karte hai, ''main bhi gear badal luungaa
 Keep watching ''udhar, sinha kii bhi apni kuch kam pareshaaniyaan nahin hai
 There is a section in the BJP itself that does not want to see them becoming mps from Patna Sahib
 par is baat ko adhik tavajjo na dete hue ve kehete hai, ''main jaanata hum kuch log meraa virodh kar rahe hai
 In politics, you may have to face opposition and opposition within your party as well
 is bare main chintaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Sometimes some people see your insecurity in your popularity
 '' lekin itnaa saaf he ki kuch logon ko shaayad sinha kuch kadam aage chal rahe lagata he
 They are also seeking votes in the name of strengthening Nitish Kumar
 mana jaataa he ki unke sambandh nitish kumaar ke saath bahut achche nahin hai
 Sinha, however, denied any rift
 ve nitish kii prashansa karte hue kehete hai, ''ham logon ke sambandh bahut hi badhiya hai or kisi prakaar kii koi daraar nahin he
 "one thing that is worth seeing is that both star leaders who have come to politics from films are facing the same type of accusation
" inhen ''bahari'' kaha ja rahaa he
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) candidate Vijay Sahu is weighing both of them in the same scales from Patna Sahib seat
 unka kahana he ki in donon kaa bihar se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 Ramakripal Yadav, president of rjd's campaign committee, says, "people of Patna should not waste their vote on these two stars
 ye to waapas mumbai laut jaaenge
 "but it will be considered as the result of the powerful arguments of Sinha and Suman that they have not allowed this issue to take much weight
" lekin chunaav kii tapish ne is baat ko to jaahir kar diya he ki yah koi saidhantik maamla nahin rah gaya he
 As promised by both of them initially
 agar suman ko lekar koi prashn daagate hai to is baat kii sambhaavnaaen he ki aapako kuch kshan ke liye sinha kii ankhon main kuch angaar dikhen
 Sinha napa-tula replies, "I don't know why he (shekhar Suman) came
" pataa nahin kisne unako yahaan bhej diya he
 Till yesterday he was trying to join BJP
 ab ratorat, unhone congress main shaamil hone se pehle hi apana namakan bhar daalaa
 "sinha smiles and shakes hands before going to her crowded next public meeting
" or aakhir main apane style main apni esayuvi ke footerest par khadey hokar baanhen failaakar abhivadan karte hai
 At each other corner of Patna, Suman is busy campaigning among the people by riding on a motorcycle
 or yuvaaon kaa shor baharaa kar dene vaala he
 But Suman talks with them
 yani donon hi sitare satta kii jang main ek-duusare ko shikast dene ke liye puri tarah qamar kase hue hai

 *** a new song from the Akshay Kumarki film 'gabbar Is Back' has been released by drinking coffee
 is gane koshruti hasanor akshay kumaar par filmaaya gaya he
 Both lead actors are seen performing romantic dance in the song
 is gane ko gaaya he dev negi or paroma das gupta ne
 This song is composed by Charantan Bhatt
 1 may ko relies hone ja rahi is film ke pramotion main akshay or shruti joro shoron se jute najar aa rahe hai
 The film was earlier named 'gabbar' but later changed to 'gabbar Is Back'
 dekhen film'gabbar ij back'kaa gaanaa 'coffee pite pite': Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reputation is at stake on the defeat or victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Bihar
 ye unke virodhiyon kaa nahin balki khud unki party ke adhyaksh amit shah kaa kahana he
 At the party's rally in Patna on Thursday, there was uneasiness about the result of the election more than the confidence in the speech of the leaders
 shuruyaat bihar ke varisht netaa or mukhyamantri pad ke sabase prabal daavedaar susheel modi ke bhaashan main dikhaa, jab unhone ye vaada kiya ki nitish sarkaar kisi karmchaaree yaa sarkaar se jude logon ko jitna vetan badhane kaa vaada kar rahi he, usase 25 pratishat zyada badha kar unki sarakar degi
 Sushil Modi has been the Finance Minister of Bihar for 8 years
 agar yahi daawa nitish kumaar yaa lalu yadav ne kiya hota to wo jarur sawaal karte ki iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 But, when it comes to his turn, he does not think it necessary to answer it in the same way as he does raise questions about the expenditure on the publicity of the Janata Dal United, but from where the money is coming for the promotion of the BJP
 Don't understand the need to give information about anyone
 amit shah ke bhaashan se pehle jo bijepi ke poster lage the, usase saafe tha ki bijepi ko philhal kisi muslim netaa kii koi jarurat nahin
 Be it Shahnawaz Hussain, make a statement against Nitish Kumar for a short circuit fire at Patna Medical College Hospital, or campaign in every village and assembly constituency or keep running delhi-patna for Iftar Party of every party leader
 But at present, the jugglers of the new elections of the party do not need them
 iskaa ek arth lagaaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarah bihar main bhi bijepi kii koshish hogi hindutv ke mudde par chunaav ladaa jaae, jisamen muslim matadaataaon ke nitish-lalu ke prati dhruvikaran kii baat kii jaae, jisaki pratikriya main hindu samaaj ke matadaata bijepi ke paksh main golband hon
 Also, the way BJP kept Bihari Babu away from his poster or stage, it has become clear that Modi-sah's team has no need of Advani supporters or people associated with them and if they are in Kop Bhawan then stay
 amit shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki bhale bijepi ke netaaon ko jaateey janaganana kii report jari naa karne ke liye har din ek nayaa tark dena pad rahaa ho, lekin agar chunaav bihar main he to pradhanmantri modi pichhadaa bhi hai or ati pichhadaa varg se bhi aate hai, isliye is aadhaar par bhi bijepi vot maangegi
 Although the BJP leaders will say that the election will be on development, but on the issue of development, BJP leaders believe that they could not fulfill the promise they promised and many of the schemes which they are counting their achievement, many of them during the UPA rule
 Were introduced in
 haa, shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki unke nishane par nitish se zyada lalu yadav or rabari devi kaa shasankaal khaskar jangal raaj rahegaa kyonki jitna jangal raaj kii baat karenge utana voter unke paksh main lamaband hoga
 But, the other side of it is that the number of times Paswan has given a clarification in favor of Lalu, telling him innocent in front of the media, the tape of his allegation will be further weakened after his tapes are played in public
 tippaniyan Also, the statements made by BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Nand Kishori Yadav and Mangal Pandey against Jitan Ram Manjhi in their alliance are shown in public, then this move can be reversed for the BJP
 haa, amit shah ne apane bhaashan main ye sanket diya he ki agle hafte pradhanmantri narendra modi jab bihar ke mujffarpur kaa daura karenge tab bihar ke liye badi badi yojana kii ghoshnaa karenge
 But, BJP leader Sushil Modi, the announcements made at the last moment of election in the rain of elections do not have much impact on the public
 baaki yahaan bhi janata dal united ke netaaon kii maane to wo taiyaari karke baithe hai ki modi ne pradhanmantri banane se pehle bihar ke kosi kshetra ke purniya main ye ghoshnaa kii thi ki bijepi sarkaar aane par bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja, vishesh aarthik package or vishesh dhyaan diya jayega to us vaade kaa kya hua? The beginning was reflected in the speech of Sushil Modi, the senior leader of Bihar and the most powerful contender for the post of Chief Minister, when he promised that the Nitish government would increase the salary by 25 per cent more than any employee or people associated with the government
 Will give their government
 susheel modi 8 varshon tak bihar ke vitt mantri rahe hai
 If Nitish Kumar or Lalu Yadav had made the same claim, they would have definitely questioned where the money will come for it
 lekin, apni baari aane par wo iskaa jawaab dena usee prakaar aavashyak nahin samajhate kii jaise wo janata dal united ke prachaar par ho rahe kharch ke bare main prashn to jarur uthaate hai, lekin bijepi ke prachaar ke liye paise kahaan se aa rahe hai, uske bare main kisi ko jaanakri dene kii jarurat nahin samajhate
 The BJP posters that were put up before Amit Shah's speech, it was clear that BJP does not need any Muslim leader at the moment
 bhale shahanvaj hossain patna medical college hospital main short circuit se lagane vaali aag ke liye nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karen yaa gaanv-gaanv or vidhansabha kshetron main ghumkar prachaar karen yaa party ke har netaa ke iftaar party ke liye dilli-patna daud lagaate rahen, lekin filhal party ke nae chunaav ke baazeegaron ko unki jarurat nahin
 It is being interpreted that like the Lok Sabha elections, in Bihar also the BJP will try to contest on the issue of Hindutva, in which the polarization of Muslim voters towards nitish-lalu, in response to which the voters of Hindu society BJP Be rounded to the side
 saath hi bijepi ne bihari babu ko apane poster yaa stage se jaise dur rakhaa usase ye baat spasht ho gai he ki modi-saah kii team ko adwani samarthak yaa unase jude logon kii koi jarurat nahin or agar wo coup bhawan main hai to rahen
 It was clear from Amit Shah's speech that even though BJP leaders are having to make a new argument every day for not releasing the caste census report, if the election is in Bihar, then Prime Minister Modi is backward and also backward class Come, so on this basis also BJP will ask for votes
 bhale bijepi ke netaa kahen ki chunaav vikaas par hoga, lekin vikaas ke mudde par bijepi ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki jitna vaada unhone kiya use puraa nahin kar paae or jin yojanaon ko wo apni uplabdhi gina rahe hai, unamem se anek upie ke shashan kaal main shuru kiye gaye
 Yes, it was clear from Shah's speech that the target of Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi's reign over Nitish would be especially Jungle Raj because the more Jungle Raj they talk about, the more votes will be mobilized in their favor
 lekin, iskaa doosraa paksh yah he ki lalu ke paksh main paswan ne jitani baar safai di he, media ke saamne unhen nirdosh bataaya he, uskaa tepe janata main chalane ke baad shayad janata main is aarope kii dhar or kamjor hogi
 The comments saath hi unke gathbandhan main shaamil jithan ram maanjhi ke khilaaf bijepi netaaon susheel modi, nand kishori yadav or mangal pandeya ne jitne bayaan die use public main dikhaaya jane laga to shayad bijepi ke liye ye chaal ulti pad sakati he
 Yes, Amit Shah has indicated in his speech that next week when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Muzaffarpur in Bihar, he will announce a big plan for Bihar
 lekin, bakaul bijepi netaa susheel modi, chunavi varsha main chunaav ke ain maukey par kii gai ghoshnaaon kaa janata par bahut jyada asar nahin hota
 The rest of the leaders of Janata Dal United are also sitting here, if they believe that Modi had announced in Purnia of Koshi region of Bihar before becoming Prime Minister that Bihar would get special state status, special economic package and What will happen to that promise if special attention is given? agar yahi daawa nitish kumaar yaa lalu yadav ne kiya hota to wo jarur sawaal karte ki iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 But, when it comes to his turn, he does not think it necessary to answer it in the same way as he does raise questions about the expenditure on the publicity of the Janata Dal United, but from where the money is coming for the promotion of the BJP
 Don't understand the need to give information about anyone
 amit shah ke bhaashan se pehle jo bijepi ke poster lage the, usase saafe tha ki bijepi ko philhal kisi muslim netaa kii koi jarurat nahin
 Be it Shahnawaz Hussain, make a statement against Nitish Kumar for a short circuit fire at Patna Medical College Hospital, or campaign in every village and assembly constituency or keep running delhi-patna for Iftar Party of every party leader
 But at present, the jugglers of the new elections of the party do not need them
 iskaa ek arth lagaaya ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarah bihar main bhi bijepi kii koshish hogi hindutv ke mudde par chunaav ladaa jaae, jisamen muslim matadaataaon ke nitish-lalu ke prati dhruvikaran kii baat kii jaae, jisaki pratikriya main hindu samaaj ke matadaata bijepi ke paksh main golband hon
 Also, the way BJP kept Bihari Babu away from his poster or stage, it has become clear that Modi-sah's team has no need of Advani supporters or people associated with them and if they are in Kop Bhawan then stay
 amit shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki bhale bijepi ke netaaon ko jaateey janaganana kii report jari naa karne ke liye har din ek nayaa tark dena pad rahaa ho, lekin agar chunaav bihar main he to pradhanmantri modi pichhadaa bhi hai or ati pichhadaa varg se bhi aate hai, isliye is aadhaar par bhi bijepi vot maangegi
 Although the BJP leaders will say that the election will be on development, but on the issue of development, BJP leaders believe that they could not fulfill the promise they promised and many of the schemes which they are counting their achievement, many of them during the UPA rule
 Were introduced in
 haa, shah ke bhaashan se spasht tha ki unke nishane par nitish se zyada lalu yadav or rabari devi kaa shasankaal khaskar jangal raaj rahegaa kyonki jitna jangal raaj kii baat karenge utana voter unke paksh main lamaband hoga
 But, the other side of it is that the number of times Paswan has given a clarification in favor of Lalu, telling him innocent in front of the media, the tape of his allegation will be further weakened after his tapes are played in public
 tippaniyan Also, the statements made by BJP leaders Sushil Modi, Nand Kishori Yadav and Mangal Pandey against Jitan Ram Manjhi in their alliance are shown in public, then this move can be reversed for the BJP
 haa, amit shah ne apane bhaashan main ye sanket diya he ki agle hafte pradhanmantri narendra modi jab bihar ke mujffarpur kaa daura karenge tab bihar ke liye badi badi yojana kii ghoshnaa karenge
 But, BJP leader Sushil Modi, the announcements made at the last moment of election in the rain of elections do not have much impact on the public
 baaki yahaan bhi janata dal united ke netaaon kii maane to wo taiyaari karke baithe hai ki modi ne pradhanmantri banane se pehle bihar ke kosi kshetra ke purniya main ye ghoshnaa kii thi ki bijepi sarkaar aane par bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja, vishesh aarthik package or vishesh dhyaan diya jayega to us vaade kaa kya hua? The BJP posters that were put up before Amit Shah's speech, it was clear that BJP does not need any Muslim leader at the moment
 bhale shahanvaj hossain patna medical college hospital main short circuit se lagane vaali aag ke liye nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karen yaa gaanv-gaanv or vidhansabha kshetron main ghumkar prachaar karen yaa party ke har netaa ke iftaar party ke liye dilli-patna daud lagaate rahen, lekin filhal party ke nae chunaav ke baazeegaron ko unki jarurat nahin
 It is being interpreted that like the Lok Sabha elections, in Bihar also the BJP will try to contest on the issue of Hindutva, in which the polarization of Muslim voters towards nitish-lalu, in response to which the voters of Hindu society BJP Be rounded to the side
 saath hi bijepi ne bihari babu ko apane poster yaa stage se jaise dur rakhaa usase ye baat spasht ho gai he ki modi-saah kii team ko adwani samarthak yaa unase jude logon kii koi jarurat nahin or agar wo coup bhawan main hai to rahen

 MLA from Chhattisgarh Kemarvahividhan Sabha seat Amitjogi is leaving this time for his father and former CM Ajit Hoagie
 ye seat jogi parivaar kii paramparaagat maani jaati he
 This seat has been very popular since the time of Madhya Pradesh, Ajit Jogi had the distinction of becoming the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh by winning from here
 bilaspur jile main aane vaala marvaahee vidhansabha kshetra madhyapradesh kii seemaa se laga hua he
 Reserved for tribal community
 is vidhansabha kshetra kii ek or khaasiyat he ki ye dalbadalu netaaon ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 In fact, every MLA from Marwahi has changed his party once or left the party and fought
 ye parampara is baar phir dekhne ko milegi, chaahe amit jogi lade yaa phir ajit jogi
 Both people have separated from Congress
 marvaahee kii khaasiyatye ilaaka ghaney jangalon se ghira hua he
 The forest is spread in about one and a half million hectares
 bhaaluon ke liye bhi ye ilaaka kaaphi mashhoor he
 Rare white bears are also found in this area, but now these bears have become the biggest problem here
 bhaaluu yahaan kii sabase badi samasyajungal main rahane vaale graminon par lagaataar bhaaluu ke hamale kii khabar aati rahati hai
 Jogi had announced to run Operation Jamwant to deal with this problem while being the Chief Minister, but this plan was also lost as soon as Jogi left
 yahi vajah he ki har chunaav main yahaan duusare muddon ke saath bhaaluu bhi ek bada mudda hota he
 In 2013, there were 11 candidates in the fray for the 2013 assembly election
 congress se amit jogi ne pita kii viraasat ko bachaane main hi nahin balki record maton se jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Amit Jogi received 82 thousand 909 votes

 The remaining candidates could not even save their bail
 2008 vidhansabha chunaavcongress ke ajit jogi ko 67523 vot mili the
 bjp's Dhyan Singh Parote received 25431 votes

 In 1985, the party cut his ticket and became Deendayal MLA of Congress
 bhavar singh naaraaz hokar congress chhod di or bijepi kaa daaman tham liya or 1990 main vidhayak bane
 In 1993 BJP again cut his ticket and Congress wrestler Singh Marawi became MLA from this seat
 jogi kaa aise bana garh2001 ke baad se ye vidhansabha jogi kii hokar rah gai
 Ajit Jogi continued to be an MLA from 2003 to 2008
 2013 main amit jogi ne is seat ko chhod diya tha
 Now Amit is leaving the seat for his father in 2018
 raajnneetik itihaas bataata he ki yahaan se bhale hi do baar bijepi ke vidhayak bane hai, lekin isaki taasir congressi hi he
 However, Amit Jogi believes that it is not Jogi's stronghold, but of Congress
 bilaspur se 150 kilometre dur marvaahee kii pidaa ye he ki yahaan kaa adivasee, vikaas to dur apane jila mukhyalay se bhi itani dur he, jahaan tak pahunchane kii himmat nahin juta paata

 british parliament ne 250 pannon kaa ek dastavej jari kiya he
 This is actually a copy of a lawsuit done in the US on Facebook

 The document contains Facebook's internal emails and other documents that were ordered sealed after an ongoing lawsuit between Facebook and an app developer

 There are two findings in this entire document - the first one is about data privacy and the second is competition
 data prisi kii vajah se hi fasebuk par mukadmaa kiya gaya or yah dastavej lim lite main aayaa he
 This document is from 2012 and experts are saying that by understanding this document, it can be said that Facebook can place the user's privacy at stake for its growth
 member of parliament demian colins ne twit kiya he
 In it, he wrote, 'I think it is in the public interest to issue this document
 ye dastavej fasebuk dwaara treet kiye gaye fasebuk yujar data par gambhir sawaal khadey karata he
 How does the Facebook app work with developers, what is the company's policy and how are they ruling the social media market? Let me tell you that a committee there is investigating Facebook privacy and in that order Documentation has been acquired from the six4tree App developer
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is dastavej main yah saaf taur par he ki company apane khaas developers ko policy ke khilaaf ja kar bhi yujar data kaa acces detii he
 a Facebook spokesperson said, "these documents are misleading
 duusare bijness kii tarah hamaare paas bhi kai internal canvarseshan hote hai

 lekin fact saaf he ki hamane kabhi logon kaa data nahin bechaa he’six4three naam kaa ek ap develpar he jisane yujar ke fasebuk frends kii jaankariyaan ikaithi karata tha
 The developer sued Facebook, as Facebook blocked the app from Facebook in 2015
 technical turm main kahen to fasebuk ne API acces block kar diya
 One such API was from Cambridge Analytica which illegally collected information from Facebook about 87 million users
 report ke mutabik is dastavej se yah samajha ja rahaa he ki fasebuk colect kiye gaye data ko kaise manage karen or isse kaise paise kamaaye ja sakate hai iske bare main vichaar kar rahi thi
 Earlier too, according to a Wall Street Journal report, some executives were thinking of selling access to user data
 is dastavej main yah bhi he ki kuch developers ke saath fasebuk ne khaas deal kii thi taaki wo fasebuk ke kadai ke baad bhi yujar data acces karte rahen
 Kangana Ranaut's film Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi released on 25 January
 critics or phens ne movie ko pasand kiya
 But Bollywood remained silent on the film based on the struggle of Rani Laxmibai's life

 lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ek samay mumbai indiens kii team 9wein over main 2 wicket par 74 ran bana chuki thi, lekin usee score par vah do wicket ganvaakar dabaav main aa gai
 First, opener Evin Lewis (48 runs) became the victim of Amit Mishra, who was stumped by wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant

 Captain Rohit Sharma (13) and Hardik Pandya (27) added 43 runs for the sixth wicket, but could not take the team closer to victory

 Rohit (13), the fifth ball of Harshal Patel, throwing the 14th over, bounced towards long on
 apni bain ore bhaagate hue maxewal ne ek baar phir kaich pakad liya, lekin khud ke kadam boundry ke baahar jane se pehle unhone gend bolt kii ore phenk di
 Bolt eventually completed that catch
 yani ye do judawaan kaich is ipel ke behtareen kaich maane ja sakate hai
 However, Bolt's name was recorded in the catch catcher on the score board
 jabaki un donon kaichon ko maxwell ne banaaya tha
 Anyway, this 'jugalbandi' of Maxwell and Bolt will be memorable
 maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ke bich rassakashimaharashtra main satta kii chaabi ensipi ke haath menmaharashtra main bijepi-shivasena ke bich mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ghamaasan jari he
 The Shiv Sena is not ready to take a step back from the 50-50 formula, so the BJP wants to keep the CM post with it
 aise main sharad pavaar ke netritv main 54 siten jeetne vaali ensipi ke haathon main maharashtra ke satta chaabi he
 In such a situation, with whom Sharad Pawar stands with BJP or Shiv Sena, cm's chair will be in his hand
 kingmekar kii bhoomika main hone ke baad bhi ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se lekar ensipi ke tamaam netaa sarkaar banane se zyada vipaksh main baithne ko lekar sahamat hai
 However, Chhagan Bhujbal has invited Shiv Sena to break with the BJP and join the NCP
 ensipi ke aise stand par sabhi kii nigahen hai
 If the NCP continues to sit in the opposition, then the Shiv Sena will have no other option but to form a government with the BJP
 shivasena maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad ko lekar apane stand par abhi tak kaayam he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Rauten on Monday once again reminded the BJP to follow coalition religion and said that the BJP should follow the 50-50 formula
 saath hi unhone ensipi ke saath jane kii atakalon par bhi apane pattey khole or kaha ki raajnneeti main vikalp khule rahete hai
 Whereas, BJP spokesperson JVL Narasimha Rao said on Monday that a bjp-led government in Maharashtra would soon form for five years
 maharashtra bijepi pravaktaa shweta shalini ne kaha ki siem bijepi kaa tha, he or aage bhi rahegaa
 We have 15 independents with us
 chote dalon ke kuch or vidhayak sampark main hai
 On the day of the Maharashtra election results, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said, "the Shiv Sena has an open offer to come with us and form the government by taking the post of Chief Minister
" shivasena ko bijepi ke saath jaakar upmukhyamantri pad chahie yaa hamaare saath aakar mukhyamantri pad, ye tay kar le
 However, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar has refused to go with anyone after the results of the assembly
 sharad pavaar ne yah kahkar shivasena ke armaanon par pani pher diya tha ki unki party ke saamne maharashtra main sarkaar gathan karne kaa vikalp nahin he, lihaaja ve janadesh ke mutabik vipaksh main baithenge
 On the question of supporting the Shiv Sena, Pawar said, 'we have no such option
 logon ne hamen vipaksh main baithne kaa aadesh diya he
 We accept the mandate
 'ensipi vipaksh main baithne ke bayaan par kaayam rahati he to shivasena ke mukhyamantri pad ke armaanon par pani phir saktaa he
 In such a situation, there will be no other option but to form a government with the BJP, because the Congress does not have enough number of mlas to support the Shiv Sena on its own and form a government
 haalanki ensipi agar bijepi ke saath chali jaati he to bahumat kaa aankada aasaani se puraa ho rahaa he
 If the NCP and BJP meet then the government is set to be formed
 jabaki, shivasena sarkaar congress-ensipi kii badaulat hi bana sakati he
 In this way, if the NCP stands with the Shiv Sena, it will also need the support of the Congress
 shivasena or ensipi ke milane ke baad 110 kaa aankada pahunchataa he, lekin bahumat ke liye 145 vidhayakon kii sankhya honi chahie
 In such a situation, people will keep an eye on the Congress strategy

 aise main bijepi or shivasena apane-apane sameekaran ko durust karne main jute hai
 In such a situation, we have to see how the politics of Maharashtra changes

 The Constitution Amendment (126th) Bill in the Rajya Sabha has already been passed by the Church of the People's Lok sabha
this bill was discussed by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Derek o'brien during the discussion on the Constitution Amendment (126th) Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 unhone kaha ki aap (sarkaar) 2 saansadon kii seat le sakate hai lekin kabhi bhi anglo indian main se indian nahin chin paaenge
 He also concluded his speech by kissing the book of the Constitution
 bill main loksabhaa or rajya vidhansabhaon main anusuchit jati tathaa anusuchit janajati samudaayon ke aarakshan ko das varsh badhaane kaa praavdhaan he
 Apart from this, there is a provision to abolish 2 seats of MP from Anglo Indian quota
 ye bill loksabhaa se pehle hi paas ho chukaa he
 What did Derek o'brien say? TMC MP Derek o'brien said that the government was extending SC-ST reservation for 10 years
 ye 6 baar pehle bhi ho chukaa he
 We welcome it
 hamaari bas yahi maang he ki sirf 10 saal ke liye kyon
 You extend for 20 years or 30 years
 ham aapkaa saath denge
 You bring amendments unhone kaha ki aap ye sab yahaan kar rahe hai, lekin bengal main beete 1 hafte se aap essi-asti ko apamaanit kar rahe hai
 Because we want to bring the SC commission bill in the assembly
 vahaan ke rajyapal ne hastakshar nahin kiya he
 TMC MP said that what is in your bill is fine, but i will talk about what is being left out
 iske baad unhone anglo indian kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that Anglo Indian has always been a forward community
 main yahaan par ek anglo indian ke taur par apni baat rakh rahaa hum
 This is a very small community
 3 se 3
 There are 5 lakh people
 hamaara samudaay chota he, lekin bahut asardaar he
 In the last 72 years, only one Anglo Indian was selected and sent here
 ye sirf mamata banerjee ne kiya
 Anglo Indians work in institutions like Army, Railways
 unhone kaha ki aap hamase 2 saansadon kii seat le sakate hai
 But never take Indian out of Anglo Indian
 ye sirf anglon indian kaa maamla nahin he
 This issue is big

 There was no agreement between the Congress and NCP on the seat sharing in Maharashtra
 der raat tak sonia gandhi ke awaas 10 janpath par chali baithak main party kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch saki
 After the meeting, Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan said that the agreement will be announced soon
 maharashtra main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar congress ke netaa aapas main hi bante hue hai
 Even after the meeting that lasted till late Wednesday in Delhi, 10 Janpath may have indicated to move forward on the agreement with NCP, but the formula which NCP and Congress will adopt has not been decided yet
 sutron kii maane to maharashtra main deshmukh camp chahta he ki formula pichhali baar kii tarah ho, yani 21 siton par ensipi or 27 par congress chunaav lade
 But the camp of Chief Minister Ashok Chavan is in favor of finding a middle ground with this formula
 ek rasta yah bhi sujhaayaa gaya he ki arpiai netaa ramdaas athavle ko is baar congress ke cote main jagah di jaae
 In this way, the matter of NCP will also remain and the formula will not change
 lekin maharashtra ke kuch congressi netaa is baat ko bhi hawa de rahe hai ki congress agar akele chunaav lade to phayda hoga
 But the question is whether the Congress will be willing to lose both the government and the coalition in Maharashtra
 halaat aise lagate nahin
 It is believed that the agreement will be announced in the next two days
 supreme court dwaara alok verma ko ek baar phir kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) ke nideshak pad par behaal karne kaa centre sarkaar ne swaagat kiya he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on the Supreme Court's decision that the government had taken the decision based on the recommendation of the CVC to save the credibility of the CBI
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne sirf sivisi kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par hi sibiai ke donon sheersh adhikariyon ko chuttee par bheja tha
 Arun Jaitley said that we will follow the decision of the Supreme Court, although the government will study the decision now
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki ye maamla abhi khatm nahin hua he
 He said that the government has no attitude in favor or fairness of any individual, when the government acted on the recommendation of the CVC only after the allegations were made
 vitt mantri ne supreme court ke faisle par kaha ki isse sibiai ke diarector ko sangrakshan mila he
 In the case that was going on, there was a round of accusation
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki sibiai ke maamle main do tareeke ke praavdhaan hai
 In the first, if there is a case related to the transfer, then it goes to the High Level Committee, but if there is a case related to corruption, then the recommendation of the CVC can also be worked out
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar ne lakshya sirf sibiai kii swytta ko bachaana tha
 Significantly, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court, while delivering a major decision, quashed the order of the Central Government, in which Alok Verma was sent on leave
 supreme court ke is aadesh ke baad alok verma dobaaraa sibiai ke nideshak pad par behaal honge, jabaki rakesh asthana, nageshwar raav special diarector ke pad par behaal honge
 Let us tell you that the Opposition has called this decision of the Supreme Court a big setback for the Modi government

 Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa's performance against corruption is in the news as he lost his chief minister's chair due to allegations of corruption
 jameen ghotaale main unhen jail bhi janaa padaa tha or avaidh khanan ke maamle main sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 In such a situation, when Yeddyurappa will raise his voice against corruption, it will obviously be discussed
 yediurppa bhrashtachar virdohi apane morche ko rajbhavan tak le janaa chaahate the, lekin police ne unhen bijepi ke duusare netaaon ke saath vidhansabha parisar main hi hiraasat main le liya
 This front of BJP mlas and mps led by Yeddyurappa demands that the four ministers in the Siddaramaiah government be immediately sacked
 unke mutabik rajya ke grahamantri keji jorge, khaadya aapurti mantri dinesh gundurav, alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri camerul islam or sahakaarita mantri mahadev prasad par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai, isliye unhen mantrimandal main bane rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 However, after the report of Lokayukta Santosh Hegde in illegal mining and the name of the land scam, the then opposition Congress demanded Yeddyurappa's resignation, he said that he should not be held guilty until the court pleaded guilty
 And therefore he will not resign
 lekin jab bijepi par dabaav badha, to party alaakaman ne jaise-taise unase istipha le liya
 After that, angry Yeddyurappa left the party and formed a new party in the name of Karnataka Janata Party
 baad main jab bijepi main narendra modi kaa prabhaav badha, to to yediurppa kii bijepi main vaapasi ho gai
 Today, Yeddyurappa is playing bugle against corruption, so it is not easy for the listeners to take it seriously

 uttar pradesh main pehle charan ke matdaan ko ab do hafte kaa hi vakt rah gaya he, lekin pradesh ke muslim matadaata duvidha main hai ki unka vot kis raajnneetik dal yaa gathbandhan ko jayega
 Aaj Tak / India Today Reporters went to the Muslim-majority areas of the state and tried to know their stand
 har jagah baat karne se nichod yahi niklaa ki muslim matadaataaon kaa vot usee raajnneetik dal yaa gathbandhan ko jayega, jo bijepi ko haraane kii sthiti main dikhegaa
 However, at no place did Muslim voters say with certainty which political party or coalition their vote would go
 ye sach he ki upi main beete dhai dashak main muslim matadaata adhiktar mulaayam singh yadav par hi bharosa jataate rahe hai
 This time the command of Samajwadi Party is not in Mulayam Singh's hands but with his son Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh necongresske saath gathbandhan kar musalamaanon ko shashakt vikalp dene kii koshish kii he, jisase musalamaanon kii duvidha khatm ho sake
 Uttar Pradesh has 20 percent of Muslim voters
 samaajawaadee party-congress gathbandhan kii khwaahish yahi he ki musalamaanon kaa ekamusth vot use mili or wo bahumat ke aankade ko chhu sake
 However, Muslims in western and eastern Uttar Pradesh are not ready to openly tell which election symbol they will press the button
 lekin jamini hakeekat ye bhi he ki adhiktar musalmaan akhilesh ke netritv vaale gathbandhan ko hi bijepi ko chunauti dene ke liye sabase behatar sthiti main maan rahe hai
 Of the 403 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, about 130 to 135 seats are where Muslim votes prove to be decisive
 inamen se zyaadaatar siten pashchimi uttar pradesh, tarai vaale ilaake or purvi uttar pradesh main hai
 Here it is difficult for any candidate to win without gaining the trust of Muslims
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main espi-congress gathbandhan par daanv?ye sach he ki musalamaanon kaa ek bada varuakhilesh sarkaarase mujffarnagar dangon ke baad se hi naaraaz rahaa
 Muslims were unhappy with the attitude of Akhilesh government on issues like love jihad, Kairana migration and conversion
 yahi vajah he ki pichley kuch vakt se pashchimi uttar pradesh main musalamaanon kaa rujhaan samaajawaadee party kii bajaae bispi kii taraf khisakta najar aa rahaa tha
 But now the Samajwadi Party's alliance with Congress may change the picture
 pashchimiuttar pradesh menmujaffarnagar, saharanpur, meerut, bagpat, hapur or gajiabad jaisi siton par ab sameekaran badalte dikh rahe hai
 a large section of Muslims can go towards the Akhilesh-led coalition
 lekin yahaan muslim matadaata ye kahana bhi nahin bhoolatey ki aakhri vakt main jo bhi bijepi ko haraata dikhegaa, unka vot usee taraf jayega
 That is, Muslim voters can press the button on his name too if the BSP candidate looks strong in many seats
 meerut jile ke zyaadaatar musalamaanon kaa rukh espi-congress gathbandhan kii taraf najar aata he
 But at the same time, in the seat from which Haji Yakub is a candidate, Muslims can vote for the BSP
 yahi baat bispi ke anya majboot ummidavaaron ke liye bhi kahi ja sakati he
 Talking about western UP, there is a significant number of Muslim voters here
 meerut or iske aasapaas ke janapadon main musalmaan votaron kii sankhya 35 se 45 fisadi tak he
 Bijnor district has around 40 per cent Muslim population
 meerut main musalmaan vot 35 se 40 fisadi hai, to mujffarnagar main ye lagbhag 35 fisadi hai
 The percentage of Muslims in Hapur is about 35 to 40 percent
 bagpat main musalamaanon kii sankhya 35 pratishat ke aasapaas he
 In all these districts, sp-congress alliance is the first choice of Muslims, BSP is seen on the second number
 lekin ummidavaaron kii majbootee ko dekhte hue ye pasand badal bhi sakati he
 Akhilesh Yadav is still the first choice of Muslims in Meerut
 meerut main musalamanespi-congress gathbandhan kohi vot dena pasand kar rahe hai
 Describing Akhilesh as the secular leader of the new era, most Muslim voters are inclined towards him
 unka kahana he ki akhilesh unako pasand karte hai or wo akhilesh ko
 Akhilesh has a different image among the young voters by running schemes like distributing laptops to students
 meerut ke muslim matadaataaon jaisi hi soch mujffarnagar or saharanpur jilon main bhi dekhne ko mili
 Muslim voters constitute about 35 to 40 percent of the seven assembly seats in Saharanpur
 saharanpur kii behat, devband va gangoh vidhaan sabha siten muslim bahul hai
 Here the Muslim voters thought that whatever would be the most powerful candidate against the BJP, they would vote for it, irrespective of the party
 tanzim ulema-e-hind ke pradesh adhyaksh moulana nadeem-ul-vaazidi ke mutabik akhilesh ko apni sarkaar kii naakaamiyon kii vajah se congress se gathbandhan ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Wajidi says that the Samajwadi Party will definitely get the benefit of this alliance because in the seats where there is no Congress candidate, 7 percent fix vote of the Congress will go to the Samajwadi Party account
 unhone saath hi kaha ki musalamaanon ko usee ummidavaar ko vot dena chahie jo bijepi ko haraata dikhe
 In Deoband, ordinary Muslim voters were also seen as the first choice of sp-congress alliance
 purvi uttar pradesh ke sameekaran alagapurvi uttar pradesh main sameekaran thode alag hai
 Here also, the Samajwadi Party is definitely the first wish of the Muslims, but here the BSP has also made a big dent in this section
 agar ansaari bandhuon ne mayawati kaa daaman thama to bispi kii taraf musalmaan jhuk saktaa he
 At least in areas like Ghazipur, Mau Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Muslims can turn to the BSP
 mukhtaar ansaari ke basapa ke tikat se mau sadar vidhaan sabha se chunaav ladane ke sanket milte hi mau main chunavi sameekaran badalata najar aa rahaa he
 The Muslim voters of Sadar are now planning to ride on elephants
 lakhanu or avadh kshetra kaa rujhanalkhanau or avadh kshetra main musalmaan samaajawaadee party or congress ke saath jayega isaki sambhaavna zyada he
 The religion guru of Sunni Muslims of Lucknow does not speak openly, but praises Akhilesh's work openly
 vahiin, shiya musalamaanon ke netaa philhal akhilesh ke saath khadey najar nahin aate
 In this area too, sp-congress alliance may be the first choice of Muslims, but wherever BSP candidates appear more strong, Muslim voters can turn to them
 varanasi main alag-alag raipradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main muslim matadaataaon kaa rukh kis or he, is bare main alag-alag raay dekhne ko mili
 If Muslim religion gurus are to be believed, it is totally wrong to see religion divided on the basis of caste
 lekin maujuuda halaat kii baat kii jaae to varanasi ke muslimon kaa rujhaan bispi kii ore badha he
 However, a section of Muslims is calling the sp-congress alliance a good step
 varanasi main muslimon kii taadaad 15
 85 percent, 28 in Azamgarh
 07 fisadi, mau main 22
 74 percent, 13 in Ghazipur
 89 fisadi or mirzapur main 10
 63 percent
 bundelkhand main sameekaran saaf nahinsmajawaadee party kii upi ke ilaakon main sabase kamjor kadi koi mana jaataa ho to wo bundelkhand he
 But the party is going to play its trumpcard here
 congress ke saath gathbandhan se yahaan phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Also, Akhilesh can contest elections here
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki bundelkhand main bispi kaaphi majboot maani jaati rahi he
 In such places, where the strong candidate of BSP will be seen, Muslims may like to bet on BSP

 The PM told the workers, 'you must have heard the statement of a coalition leader recently
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki centre main ek majboot nahin, majaboor sarkaar kii jarurat he
 You can understand why they expect a forced government
 'bataa den ki bispi supremeo mayawati ne july main apane ek bayaan main kaha tha, 'bispi ke janmdata or sansthaapak kanshiram kii ye raajnneetik aawaaj aaj sateek baithti he ki vartmaan halaat main majboot nahin majaboor sarkaar kii jarurat he
 It means that there should be such a coalition government at the center so that the sword of working in the interest of the country is hanging on it and the government cannot behave in the manner of dictatorship as is seen today in the BJP era
 'bijepi ke khilaaf ban rahe mahagathbandhan par piem modi ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha, 'gathbandhan kii chintaa aap chhod dijie
 These are the people gathered with compulsion, who are on bail
 wo log khud ko bachaane kaa rasta dhund rahe hai
 They have not gathered for the betterment of the public, they have only one purpose to remove Modi
 'piem ne booth kaaryakartaaon ko 'meraa booth, sabase majboot' kaa mantra dete hue kaha ki chunaav jeetna hamaare liye kisi ko parrast karne kaa ahankaar nahin he, hamaare liye ye seva karne kaa ek avasar he

 Uttar Pradesh Home Department principal secretary Devashish Panda had said that the state government would not allow stones to come to Ayodhya for the Ram temple
 unhone kaha tha, 'chunki maamla court main vichaaradhin he, lihaaja sarkaar ayodhya mudde ke babat koi nai parampara shuru karne kii ijaajat nahin degi

 baccha skool main to duusare bacchon ke saath milakar kaaphi kuch sikh-pard letaa he lekin ghar par use padhaanaa thodaa mushkil he
 Usually parents do not know what is the right way to teach a child
 unhen lagata he ki bachche ko daant dena yaa maar dena hi ek vikalp he taaki darkar vah padhai karne lage
 But the question is whether this is really the right way
 nahin, bilkul nahin! bachche ko daraakar aap use apane saamne to padhane ke liye majaboor kar sakate hai lekin aapaki najar hatate hi vah padhai ko boj samajhakar taal degaa
 In such a situation, it is very important for the parents to know how to teach the child so that he will enjoy the education and his interest in studies will increase
 bacchon ko padhaane se pehle yah jaan len ki is kaam main aapako dhairya kii aavashyaktaa he
 The child will ask you the same question many times and you will have to explain it
 iske alaava bachche ko padhaane ke dauraan in baton kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhen :1
 If the child is very young, try to teach him with the help of photo book, book of poems or video of poems
 2
 There are many toys for teaching young children
 unka istemaal bhi bahut phydemand hoga
 Your child will learn a lot in sports
 3
 Talk with children full of information
 unke sawaalon kaa taarkik jawaab dene kii koshish karen
 Anything is understood more quickly by listening
 4
 Do not tie the child in the house
 bachche samaaj main chizon ko dekhakar or duusare bacchon se milakar bhi kaaphi kuch sikhte hai
 5
 bacchon ke saath sakhti baratane ko ekmaatr vikalp nahin maane
 Try to explain it differently to children
 ve jid kar sakate hai lekin ek baar unke man se maar yaa daant kaa dar nikal gaya to ve aapaki izzat karnaa bhi chhod denge

 com / npsmggefla In a debate on the issue of politics in the name of religion, actor Prakash Raj and BJP spokesperson Malvika Avinash came face to face
 darasal, bijepi pravaktaa malvika avinaash ne samvidhan ko lekar prakaash raaj se ek sawaal poocha to actor ne malvika ko samvidhan padhane kii salaah de di
 The occasion was a session in India Today's 'karnataka Panchayat' held in Bengaluru (karnataka)
 isamen prakaash raaj, congress netaa khushboo sundar, bijepi pravaktaa malvika or kendriya rajya mantri babul supriyo ne shirkat kii
 At the end of the debate Malvika asked Prakash, 'when the Indian Constitution was written, what was its preamble?' In response, Prakash Raj said, 'if you don't know then go and read
 'prakaash raaj ne aage kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa aap bataaiye
 Will you all come and talk on the subject
 ' babul ne bhi is par prakaash raaj se jawaab maanga
 After this Malvika said, 'I tell you
 samvidhan kii prastaavna main likhaa he ki bharat ek samprabhu loktantric ganraajya he
 In response Prakash Raj said, 'the preamble does not say that India is a Hindu nation
 ' malvika boleen, 'ye hindu muslim kii baat nahin kahata
 When Modi's minister and Prakash Raj clashed with each other over religious bigotry, in the first debate, Prakash Raj attacked the BJP on the question of Hindutva and culture and also claimed that the politics of BJP in Karnataka failed
 kis hindutv se he dikkat? sawaal ke jawaab main prakaash ne kaha, aaj reeti-rivaajon ko dharm maan liya gaya he
 According to the Hindutva in which there is talk of spraying go-urine on the stage, according to this, they should drink a glass of urine daily, because this too is a belief
 lekin aap mujhase aisa karne ke liye nahin kah sakate
 Prakash said that every religion, irrespective of Hinduism, always teaches to be tolerant of others
 modi ke mantri babul bole- maine bhi khaaya he bif, kai pakistani mere dostbabul supreyo ne kaha, dharmik sahishnutaa kaa matlab yah nahin he ki main apane dharm kaa aadar na karun
 The biggest thing is that if i do not respect my religion myself, how will anyone else do it? i have visited both the temple and the mosque
 bachapan kaa zikr karte hue bataaya, main kisi tarah ke puja-paath par vishwaas nahin karata, lekin mujhe yaad he meri daadi mujhe masjid le jaaya karti thim
 She used to do this for her eyes in childhood

 He had not consulted his father (filmmaker David Dhawan) in this regard

 a change was taking place in him, where he could not see this change on his own
 
 i have met many people in my life who have suffered tremendous mental and physical wounds but currently they are engaged in small business

 Famous flute player Pandit Ronu Majumdar said in a special conversation, 'I have brought a mixer from Germany, using which one can enjoy the resonance (echo), resonance and folk style juices in the flute and use it to control the voice can be done
 ’ isse bansuri kii dhwani main tabdili ke bare puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘takanic ke prayog se kisi vaadya yantra kaa mul swar prabhavit nahin hona chahie balki ise shrotaaon ko mul dhwani kaa ahsaas karaane main madadgaar hona chahie
 'he said,' This mixer is not directly connected to the flute but is connected to the microphone
 iske prayog se bansuri kii dhwani main syntheticapan (banaavatipan) nahin aayegaa or isaki asli khushboo khatm nahin hogi balki shrota ko aditorium main iske vividh swaroopon kaa anubhav hoga

 ’ iske alaava bansuri ko samrudh karne waalon main pandit raghunatha seth, pandit vijay raghav raav or pandit devendra gurudeshwar pramukh he
 The contribution of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia in this is incredible
 gauratlab he ki ronu majumdaar ne hi shankh bansuri kaa izaad kiya he or iske liye vah assam se saadhe teen foot lanbaa bans kaa tukdaa lekar aaye the
 He says that the bamboo flute has its own classical identity and no one can steal the sweetness of its notes
 majumdaar ne kaha ki kisi bhi vaadya yantra main badlaav kaaphi gambhirtha se kiye jane chahie taaki mul swaroop main parivartan naa aane paye
 He gave examples that like applying metal horns in shehnai makes a difference in its original form
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, aisa mana jaataa he ki bansuri krishna se bahut pehle hi astitv main aa chuki thi
 Bamboo clumps in the forests made insects clue and when the wind passed through it, the sweet sound began to float throughout the atmosphere
