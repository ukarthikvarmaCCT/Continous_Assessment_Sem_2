 dilli dairedevills ne ipel nilaamee ke dauraan yuvaraj singh ke liye 16 karod rupee kii baari bharkam boli lagaai thi, lekin ab tak is toornament main yah khilaadi phiseddi hi sabit hua he
 The team management is now giving clarification on how to bid so high for this aging player
 dilli dairedevills ke siio hemanth dua ne kaha ki ipel ke bazaar ne yuvaraj singh kii 16 karod rupee kii keemat nirdhaarit kii or frenchiji is umradraj star kii is satr main asafalataa ke baavjood puraa samarthan karti he
 Let us tell you that Yuvraj has 18 in 12 matches in the current season
 63 kii ausat se mahaj 205 ran banaae hai or unki team plyaaf kii daud se lagbhag baahar ho chukaa he
 On the questions raised about this decision of the team, Dua says, 'we are talking about 14 crore, 16 crore rupees, but it is all set on the market
 yuvaraj ne (vishakhapattanam main) sahi kaha tha ki unhone kabhi is keemat ke liye nahin kaha tha
 It was based on the market
 ' He admitted that he would have liked to buy them at a lower price, but when the bidding started, it reached far ahead
 dua ne kaha, 'kya ham chaahate ki yah 16 karod rupaye tak pahunche
 No
 ek frenchiji ke rup main main chahta ki yah jitna sambhav ho utana kam ho
 But there were also rivals (anti-franchisees) and they wanted the price to keep rising
 isliye maine kaha ki yah sab bazaar ne tay kiya
 ' dua ne jahaan saaf kiya ki frenchiji puri tarah se yuvaraj ke saath he, lekin sweekaar kiya ki badi keemat ke bare main lagaataar yaad dilaae jane se khilaadi prabhavit hua, kyonki aakhir main 've bhi insaan hai
 Comments dua ko puraa vishwaas he ki yuvaraj kharaab daur se ubar jayega
 He said, 'he will overcome the kind of player he is and as a franchise we support him in every way
 ham ise unki galati ke rup main nahin dekhte hai
 He is here to perform and is trying his best
 ' Dua was asked if he was involved in Daredevils' long-term plan keeping in mind the age of Yuvraj and Zaheer Khan, adding, "if they are happy to play more then we have no problem
" lekin unka sharir kab sanket dena shuru karata he yah puri tarah se un par nirbhar he
 Deciding on a career is a personal one and i cannot comment on it
 ' Delhi Daredevils CEO Hemant Dua said that the IPL market set Yuvraj Singh's price at Rs 16 crore and the franchise fully supports the aging star despite his failure this season
 aapako bataa den ki yuvaraj ne maujuuda satr main 12 maichon main 18
 He has scored just 205 runs at an average of 63 and his team is almost out of the playoff race
 team ke is faisle ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par dua kehete hai, 'ham 14 karod, 16 karod rupee ke bare main baat kar rahe hai, lekin ye sab bazaar par nirdhaarit he
 Yuvraj was right (in Visakhapatnam) that he had never asked for this price
 yah bazaar par aadhaarit tha
 ' unhone sweekaar kiya ki ve unhen kam keemat par khareednaa pasand karte lekin jab boli shuru hui to phir vah kaaphi aage tak pahunch gayi
 Dua said, 'do we want it to reach 16 crores
 nahin
 As a franchise i want it to be as low as possible
 lekin vahaan pratidwandvi (virdohi frenchiji) bhi the or ve chaahate the ki keemat badhati rahe
 So i said that the market decided it all
 ' Dua made it clear that the franchise is completely with Yuvraj, but admitted that the player was impressed by the constant reminder about the big price, because in the end 'he too is a human being
 'tippaniyan Dua is confident that Yuvraj will recover from a bad phase

 His name had become bigger than that
 police ke paas naam pataa tha lekin uski koi tasviir nahin thi
 Extortion from traders, kidnapping, murder, robbery, unrestrained rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bas yahi uskaa pesha tha
 And whoever came between it did not delay at all to kill him
 lihaaja log to log police tak usase darati thi
 He was later killed by the STF in Ghaziabaz

 Subhash was jailed in UP for many years
 mukhtaar ansarikai kukhyat aparaadhiyon kaa garh mana jaataa he upi kaa purvanchal
 Although many leaders came from Purvanchal but one such name comes from this region which came into politics from the world of crime and became the Robinhood of Purvanchal
 us bahubali netaa kaa naam he mukhtaar ansaari
 Mukhtar Ansari has been ranked first among the mafia leaders of the state
 unka janm upi ke gajipur jile main hua tha
 The fearless and overbearing Mukhtar student was active in politics since his teens
 purvanchal ke vikaas ko lekar kai yojanaayen jab shuru hui to vahaan jameen kabjane ko lekar do gang ban gaye
 In front of Mukhtar Ansari, Brajesh Singh of Sahib Singh Gang formed his own separate gang
 brajesh singh ke saath mukhtaar kii dushmani ho gai thi
 After student politics, he had ventured into the world of crime due to ground business and contracts
 purvanchal ke mau, gajipur, varanasi or jonpur main unke naam kaa sikaa chalane laga tha

 Firing hamale main mukhtaar ke teen log maare gaye
 Brajesh Singh was injured in this attack
 uske maare jane kii afvaah thi

 He wanted to become a big gangster
 use jonpur ke sthaneey dabang mafia gajraj singh kaa sangrakshan mila
 In 1984, Munna killed a businessman for plunder
 phir jonpur ke bhaajapa netaa ramchandra singh kaa katl kiya
 In the 90s, he joined the gang of Bahubali mafia and politician Mukhtar Ansari
 wo sarkari thekon ko prabhavit karne laga
 But BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai began to challenge him
 munna ne mukhtaar ke kehane par 29 november 2005 ko krishnanand raay ko bhun daalaa tha
 He was jailed for the last several years
 haal hi main munna bajrangi ko court main peshi ke liye jhaansi se bagpat laayaa gaya tha, lekin jail ke andar hi uski goli maar kar hatya kar di gai

 His political opponents Harihar Singh and Panchu Singh worked together with colleagues
 raajnneetik varchasv kii ladaai main pita kii maut ne brijesh singh ke man main badale kii bhaavana ko janm de diya
 Due to this feeling, Brijesh inadvertently stepped into the world of crime
 aage chalakar usne apane pita ke paanch hatyaron ko maut kii neend sula diya
 But enmity with Mukhtar Ansari cost him dearly
 isi ke chalate hi brijesh singh ke chachere bhai satish singh kii din dahaade hatya kar di gai
 The entire Purvanchal was shaken by this incident

 However, in order to get control of the ever increasing crime in Ghaziabad, the police have also tightened their gears as there have been frequent encounters between the police and the miscreants here in the last few months and the miscreants have also been arrested
 kuch maheene pehle colors channel or darshakon ke fevorett kamedian kapil sharma ke bich kuch anban ho gai thi
 For this reason, Colors replaced Kapil's show 'comedy Nights with Kapil' and started 'save Comedy Nights' instead
 lekin ab matbhedon ke baavjood colors 'kamedi nits vid kapil' ke puraane episods ko ravivaar ko phir se telecast kar rahaa he
 It is being said that Kicklers has taken this step in view of its declining TRP on Sunday
 darasal kai dinon se ravivaar costar plus or soni tiviki tiarapy colors se zyada aa rahi thi
 On Sunday afternoon, Star Plus telecasts serials like 'saath Nibhana Saathiya', 'diya Aur Baati Hum', 'jana Na Dil Se Door' and 'humko Tumse Ho Gaya Pyaar Kya Kare'
 vahiin soni par 'da kapil sharma sho' nambar van bana hua he
 This is the reason that Colors are having to make episodes of Comedy Nights with Kapil
 gauratlab he ki yah sho darshakon ke baach kaaphi lokapriy tha
 Perhaps Colors found it right to increase his TRP

 The Avengers is a popular Hollywood film series
 isaki final kadi april main relies hogi
 According to the theory of a fan group, The Hulk and Bruce will be seen separately in 'avengers: End Game'
 yadi aisa hua to phans ek hi screen par bruce or halk ko milakar dushmano se ladate dekh paaenge
 In the films of Marvell, the director has done this before
 spidar main-3 main mekars ne spidar main ke achche or bure donon swaroopon ko ek saath parde par laakar khadaa kar diya tha jise phans ne khub enjoy kiya
 Bruce's angry appearance in The Avengers Infinity War did not come out
 bruce ke kaaphi koshish karne par bhi vah baahar nahin aata or natijatan phans is mega movie main halk kaa ection miss kar dete hai
 Apparently, many fans have not been able to see their superheroes in the fight scenes but if the news is to be believed then all those complaints will be cleared in the second part of the film
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki mekars aisa karenge kaise? to bataaya ye ja rahaa he ki ek time travel theory kii madad se puraane halk ko waapas laayaa jayega, taaki vah bruce kii madad kar sake
 The result would be that both Bruce and Hulk would be together to take on the enemy
 haalanki, in sabhi baton se itar ek tathy yah bhi he ki film ke trailor video main halk kii koi jhalak najar nahin ai he
 Also, no official announcement has been made by the makers
 to kya mekars halk ke phans ko sarprise karnaa chaahate hai? yaa vakt ke saath mekars film kaa ek doosraa trailor launch karenge, jisamen kai nae raaj khole jaaenge? shaayad phans ko iske liye thodaa or intjaar karnaa hoga

 adbhut ection or apane alag style se lash tom krooj kii film kisi bani he,aaie jaanate hai
 Review: Disappoints 'saheb Biwi Aur Gangster 3', Story and Direction Neutralized: The film's story begins with a dream, where Tom Cruise (ethan Hunt) finds himself in the lurch
 ithan ko khabar milti he ki atomic bam banane vaale hathiyaaron kii chori ho gai he, jiskaa istemaal duniya ke vinaash ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the IMF mission ends badly and Solomon Lane (sean Harris) escapes from custody and the world faces dire consequences
 ithan hunt is vifaltaa ko apane upar le letaa he or apane kaam ko puraa karne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Seeing his actions, the CIA starts questioning Ethan
 isi ke saath ithan mishan par nikal padate hai or apane sabhi doston ke saath alag-alag deshon main jaakar dushmano kaa peechha karte hai
 In this way of saving the world, he has to fight with the murderers as well as his old comrades, and as always this time the story ends at such a turn
 sarprise element barkaraar rahete hai
 Dhadak Review: Like Agaaz Sairat, but see the consequences
 Film: This film is a thrilling action and stunt-filled film
 ek bahut hi romaanchak stant filmaaya gaya he, jiskaa naam long line he
 The stunt was shot in New Zealand, in which Tom Cruise had to climb a helicopter flying 2,000 feet above the ground with a rope and then jump off the rope with a payload 40 feet above
 wo film main jabardast tareeke se darshaya gaya he
 Although the first part of the film runs quite slowly, the second half is very good and especially the last 20 minutes
 film main aapako samay-samay par isaki signechar dhun bhi sunai padati he jo kahani ko or bhi dilachasp bana detii he
 Tom Cruise is once again seen doing tremendous and amazing feats on cars, helicopters, ships and bikes
 iske alaava baaki kirdaaron ne bhi badhiya kaam kiya he
 Cinematography is good along with directions
 weekend par aapke paas ek aisi film he jo puure parivaar ke saath dekhi ja sakati he

 bengalooru ke police kamishnar praveen sood ne jaankaree di ki madhukar reddy naam ke shaks kii giraftaar kii khabar hamen mili he jisaki jaanch ke liye ham apni team bhej rahe hai
 Dr
 SC Chandra, former Medical Superintendent of Delhi's Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, has opened his front against Arvind Kejriwal
 unhone alji ko i-mail bhejkar shikaayat kii he ki jo aarope lagaakar mukhyamantri ne unhen medical suparitendent ke pad se hataaya he, wo bebuniyaad hai
 This has severely damaged his image
 lihaaja arvind kejariwal yaa to unase bina shart maafee maangen, nahin to unke khilaaf wo avmaananaa kaa maamla darj karavaaenge
 Significantly, Chief Minister Kejriwal conducted a surprise inspection of the hospital on 25 May and during this time he noticed deficiencies in the hospital
 iske baad dow essi chandra ko unke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Dr
 SC Chandra told NDTV that in an email sent to the Lieutenant Governor, he has written that the allegations made by the honorable CM against me are all wrong
 maine ye sabit kar diya he
 Now the Chief Minister does not apologize either unconditionally and if he does not do so, i will have to file a defamation case against him
 25 may ko mukhyamantri ne auchak nirikshan main paaya ki vahaan dawaaon kii kami he, do test nahin ho rahe hai or contract par kaam kar rahe karmchaariyon ko nau maheene se vetan nahin mila he
 In response, Chandra wrote that medicines were 82% in our hospital that day and consumability 86
 5% tha jo baaki aspataalon ke mukaable yaa to baraabar tha yaa phir kuch aspataalon se kahin zyada tha
 Two tests were not being done, because we did not have a rate contract from any hospital
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad hamen rate mila or hamane turant karrwai shuru kar di
 The comments pehle to mukhyamantri kejariwal ne 25 may ko ection teken report maanga
 Still, when he was not satisfied, he wrote a letter to LG on 31 May asking him to remove MS
 jaankaree ke mutabik unhone kaha ki essi chandra kaaphi prabhavi hai, isliye is pad par bane hue hai
 While Dr
 SC Chandra says something else
 unke mutabik wo emes nahin bananaa chaahate the or unhone inkaar bhi kiya tha
 The reason for this is that his mother is ill and on dialysis
 unhone 17 march se pad sambhala
 Then how does his accountability for nine months salary become? If the contractor does not bill, how will the hospital release the salary? ab sarkaar kah rahi he is shikaayat ke peeche bijepi he
 In this regard, when Delhi government minister Gopal Rai wanted to know the government's side, Rai said that BJP is behind this complaint
 jab kamiyaan pai gayi to kya mukhyamantri ke paas emes ko bhi barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he

 jab kamiyaan pai gayi to kya mukhyamantri ke paas emes ko bhi barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 On May 25, the Chief Minister, on surprise inspection, found that there is a shortage of medicines, two tests are not being done and the employees working on the contract have not been paid for nine months
 iske jawaab main chandra ne likhaa he ki hamaare aspataal main us din dawaai 82% the or kanjumability 86
 5% which was either equal to or more than some hospitals
 do test nahin ho rahe the, kyonki hamaare paas rate kontract nahin tha kisi aspataal kaa
 After much effort, we got the rate and we immediately started taking action
 tippaniyan First, Chief Minister Kejriwal sought an Action Taken Report on 25 May
 phir bhi jab wo santusht nahin hue to unhone 31 may ko alji ko chitthee likhakar emes ko hataane ko kaha
 According to the information, he said that SC Chandra is very effective, so remains in this post
 jabaki dow essi chandra kaa kahana kuch or he
 According to him, he did not want to become MS and he also denied
 isaki vajah ye he ki unki maa biimaar hai or dialysis par hai
 He held the position from 17 March
 phir nau maheene kii selary ke liye unki javabdehi kaise banati he? contractor agar bill na de to aspataal kaise selary jari karegaa? Now the government is saying that BJP is behind this complaint
 is babat dilli sarkaar ke mantri gopal raay se jab sarkaar kaa paksh jaananaa chaha gaya, to raay ne kaha ki is shikaayat ke peeche bijepi he
 When deficiencies are found, does the Chief Minister not have the right to sack MS as well
 pehle to mukhyamantri kejariwal ne 25 may ko ection teken report maanga
 Still, when he was not satisfied, he wrote a letter to LG on 31 May asking him to remove MS

 pradooshan par ection plan banane ke liye neshnal green tribunel (engiti) nedillisarkaar ko 31 disambar tak kaa vakt diya he
 The court has asked the government to make full preparations and explain what factors are responsible for increasing pollution in Delhi and how they can be overcome
 phir chaahe wo construction se judaa pradooshan ho yaa dilli main vaahanon ke istemaal se judaa ho yaa phir kheti ke chalate hone vaala pradooshan ho

 Gaurav Kumar Bansal, who used the 14-year-old data application, says that the government is still using the data of the 2004 Climate Change Action Plan
 iskaa arth he ki sarkaar 14 saal puraane data ko istemaal karke nayaa ection plan banaaegi jabaki pichley dedh dashak main dilli ke paryaavaran or pradooshan kii sthiti main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he

 climet change ko lekar apana ection plan taiyaar karenengiti ne 2 saal pehle hi dilli sarkaar nirdesh diya tha ki vah climet change ko lekar apana ection plan taiyaar kare
 In this action plan, the Delhi government had to make a guideline as to what steps to be taken to increase the level of pollution

 main raveesh kumaar
 Dera and Danda are used in sannyas tradition as if everything is temporary, but in Punjab Haryana, dera means permanent and stands outside Danda Dera
 jiske saamne chunaav ayog kii press conference hote hi hamaari raajnneeti sar jhukaane chali jaati he
 The leaders know that devotees of Babas can vote at their behest
 isliye ab netaa bhi apane bhakt banane lagen hai
 The voter also has an identity as a devotee
 haryana punjab main jo bhi ho rahaa he, uski buniyaad main samaaj sarkaar sansthaaen sab hai
 You voters, ie the audience, know very well that the leaders rotate around these camps in turn
 kya congress, kya bijepi, ye pi, wo pi, sab jate hai
 In this election, BJP went to Ramraheem with many of its candidates
 jeetne ke baad dhanyavad gyaapan ke liye bhi gai
 It is being said that Rampal also supported the BJP
 imam se lekar yoga guru tak sab vot ke samay raajnneetik dalon ke campen manager ban jate hai
 The race to make a devotee a voter and a voter a devotee begins
 aapke paas good sant or bed sant main fark karne kaa vikalp tak nahin bachaa he
 There is a gland to make India a world guru, which is stuck, to make it, sometimes we start to see the political future of India in a religious face or sometimes in some political face, the religious future
 samvidhan main likhaa he ki vaigyanik soch kaa prachaar-prasar kiya jayega, lekin plastic surgery kaa udgam kuch or bataa diya jaataa he
 Even then, one would think that in the presence of so many ashrams and followers, spiritual tolerance has increased or there has been more fanaticism
 hisar ke rampal koi pehle nahin hai or hamaare samay main akele nahin hai
 Rampal, a junior engineer for eighteen years, is from Dhanana village in Sonepat
 khud ko kabirpanthi bataate hai or dharti par avatar naam kii kitaab main kabir inhen raushan aashirwad bhej rahe hai
 You can also learn about Rampal from his website
 kitaab ke achche khaase hisse main aryasamaj or dayanand saraswati ke vichaaron kii aalochana he
 Different interpretations of all religious texts have been introduced
 rampal kaa kahana he ki paramatma niraakaar nahin he
 He is real
 vedon ko satya maanane vaale maharishi dayanand tathaa unke bhakt bhi paramatma tathaa veda gyaan se apirichit rahe hai
 Whereas the divine in the Vedas is formless
 vah sasharir aata he
 So, in this background, there will be situations of confrontation between the Aryasamajis and the followers of Rampal who are called Kabirpanthis
 jisamen kai log ghayal hue or kuch kii hatya hui
 The lawsuit is going on in these contexts
 janm mrityu se sambidhat tamaam karmkaandon ke virdohi hai
 Temples and pilgrimages refuse to go

 haraar kaa zikr kiya he
 There may not be a Julvern in French, but i read it as written
 padhate hue hairaani hui ki hamaare apane jyotishiyon ne koi bhavishyavaanee nahin kii kya
 Like Kiro and Harar
 in sab bhavishyavaaniyon main rampal ko avatar bataaya gaya he
 1990, 1998, 2000, 2006, referring to different types of years and centuries to the twentieth and twelfth centuries
 in bhavishyavaaniyon kii bhashaa aapke ankar ko bahut aakarshith karti hai
 All incarnations occur in the first half or the second half of the century, ie the last part

 Anyway patrakaron par police kii barasati laathiyon ko dekhakar kya aap haryana ke police mahanideshak kii baat par yakeen karenge ki police kii aisi koi manshaa nahin thi
 Do the sticks run automatically without the intended order? Two soldiers were also shot and 105 policemen were injured in the shootout between the ashram and police, around 80 were also injured
 dijipi esen vashishtha is ghanghor lathicharge ke baad bhi bol rahe hai ki haryana sarkaar media kaa sahyog kar rahi hai
 Is Lathi's new name Sahyog? Can the police be without command even after so much deployment? ek ke baad ek hoti ja rahi aisi ghatnaon ke prati ham sahishnu hote rahe to dabaav ke aaropon se dabi press or dab jaaegi
 Till date our partners are also included in all the injured journalists including AVBP channels
 mukesh, siddharth, cameraman fahd talha, sachin gupta, ashvini kumaar or ashok mandal in sabko lathi lagi he
 The DGP has said that those who attacked the media will be arrested
 ek rampal ko giraftaar to kar nahin sake or ab media par lathi chalaakar police ko hi giraftaar karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Why is the government scared in the name of faith? Is it because the government also uses faith? saurav ganguli guuruuvaar ko tab kuch samay ke liye pareshaani main pad gaye jab vah eden gardens ke club house main lagi 29 saal puraani lift main funs gaye or is purv bhartiya captain ko stool kii madad se baahar nikaala gaya
 On the eve of the second Test match against New Zealand, Bengal Cricket Association (CAB) President Ganguly was coming to his office on the first floor but the old lift with hand operated doors got stuck in the middle
 surakshakarmiyon ne haalanki furti dikhaai taaki koi durghatana na ghate
 a security official said, "we immediately switched off the power and opened the door by hand
 iske baad ek stool neeche latakaaya gaya or dada us par chadhakar upar nikle
 "this incident happened at five in the evening
 adhikari ne kaha, "jab aisi ghatnaayen hoti hai to ham turant hi bijli band kar dete hai or gril ko haath se kholte hai
 "comments cab ke ek purv sachiv ne bataaya ki yah lift 1987 main stadium main navinikaran kaary ke dauraan lagaai gai thi jab yahaan vishwa cap final hua tha

 Nowadays film awards ceremonies are everywhere
 har sitara kisi na kisi samaaroh main najar aa rahaa he, or kai to aise hai adhiktar sabhi puraskaar samarohon main raunak bikher rahe he
 New types of awards are being announced
 kai jagah to aisa bhi dekhne ko mila ki ek heroin ko puraskaar dene kaa bahaanaa chahie tha to unki fitness ko hi bahaanaa bana liya gaya, or unhen puraskaar se navaj diya gaya
 There are some people in Bollywood who like to stay away from awards and award ceremonies
 aisa hi ek namakangana ranotka bhi he
 It is not that their films do not attend this function or that they do not do films which can get awards
 pichley saal jahaan 'queen' puraskaar samarohon main chai rahi thi, vahiin is saal unki film 'tanu vaids manu riterns' adhiktar category main apni jagah banaai hue he
 Then his character of Datto has become hard-hearted
 chaliekangana se hi jaanate hai ki aakhir unhen puraskarasmaroh kyon pasand nahin hai, 'main jaanati hum ki system ke khilaaf khadaa hona aasaan nahin he
 But it is not easy to do the right thing every time

 ye puraskaar samaaroh jenuin nahin hai
 i know these are commercial ceremonies aimed at trps and earning money

 The main category goes to those who can help raise trps
 chaahe ve upyukt paatr hon yaa nahin, yah myne nahin rakhata
 i think it should not happen
 is parampara ko badla janaa chahie
 The organizers should be honest and say that this is not just an award ceremony but a procession
 main kisi bhi beyimaan cheez kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahati
 That is why i criticize him
 vaaki kaam to khud bolta he or yah batakanganakai maukon par khud hi siddh kar chuki hai

 oxigen chahie to sawaalon ko ropate-ugaate rahiye
 Democracy gets oxygen from this greenery
 sawaal jitne lahalahaayenge, gahare, ghaney or chhatnar hote jaaenge, loktantr kaa praan utana hi shaktishaalee ho jayega
 See, lack of oxygen (questions) suffocated the children in Gorakhpur
 purvi uttar pradesh main inseflitis ko rokane ko lekar yogi adityanath kii gambhirtha sansad ke record main darj he lekin jo kaam ve apane puure sansadeey jivan ke dauraan lagaataar karte rahe, unke mukhyamantri banane ke baad vah kaam dhimaa padaa or band ho gaya
 The task was to question the government and its system
 uttar pradesh ke purab main machharon se upji mahamari har saal aati he
 Yogi Adityanath used to wake up Delhi by constantly questioning preparations to deal with it
 unhen in sawaalon kii takat akhabaaron or logon kii pratikriyaaon se milti thi
 This would keep an eye on the mistakes, the medical system used to be rattled intermittently and the system was not allowed to sleep to such an extent that patients forget to give oxygen
 sarkaar badalane ke baad na to japani bukhaar ke machhar mare, na purvi uttar pradesh main gandagi kam hui or na hi aspataal sudhare lekin inseflitis se jude sawaalon kii oxigen kam ho gai
 Result: 60 children died panting
 hairaani is baat par thi ki bacchon kii maut ke baad apni pehali press vaarta main, mukhyamantri unheen sawaalon par khafa the jinhen lekar ve har saal dilli jate the
 There are more samples
 railway ko hi len
 Improving the system by learning from past mistakes is a regular process
 pichley teen saal se railway main kuch sevaayen sudharin lekin saath hi kai pahaluon par andhera bad gaya jin par sawaalon kii roshni padai chahie thi lekin prashnon ko lekar bahut sahajata nahin dikhi
 Then came cag's latest report on the plight of catering, cleaning, electrification in the railways, which reversed the entire pink campaign
 notebandi ke dauraan jab log iske asar or kriyanyavyan par sawaal uthaa rahe the, tab un sawaalon se naaraaz hone vaale bahuterey the
 Now, eight months later, when the names of those who died in the queues of banks are seen in the report card of this exercise, those questions are being remembered
 sawaalon kii koi rajnatik party nahin hoti
 Asking questions is not fashion
 vyavastha par sawaal kisi bhi gavarnence kii buniyadi jarurat he
 a senior minister in the previous BJP government tried it interestingly
 yadi unka vibhaag khabaron se baahar ho jaae to ve patrakaron se poochhate the, kya hamaare yahaan sab aman-chaiyn he? ve kehete the ki main antaryami to hum nahin jo apane har daftar or karmchaaree ko dekh sakuun
 Questions and criticisms are my political power through which i can fix the system
 adityanath yogi ho sakate hai lekin ve antaryami haragij nahin hai
 Even after going to Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, he could not know that there was a lack of oxygen for the last several weeks
 praan vaayu kii supplai ke liye chitthiyaan filon main tahal rahi hai or bacchon kii maut badhati ja rahi hai, jabaki is kshetra ke saansad ke taur par unke paas yah sari jaankariyaan rahati thim or inhen par sawaal uthaakar ve centre or pradesh sarkaar ko jagaate the
 The whole country is shocked by the incident in Gorakhpur
 bhaajapa or sarkaar bhi kam asahaj nahin hai
 Leaders and officials are now saying that the right information is not reaching those who have to take a decision
 sawaalon se parhez or aalochanaon se dar puri vyavastha ko anjaane khataron kii taraf dhakel detaa he
 The chair will be heard exactly what she wants to hear
 sarkarein hameshaa apana prachaar karti hai or loktantr kii anya sansthaaen hameshaa us par sawaal uthaati hai
 These questions reduce the political risk of leaders by saving them from being cut off from their roots
 bharat kaa samvidhan likhane vaali sabha ne adhyakshiya loktantr kii tulana main sansadeey loktantr ko shaayad is vajah se bhi chunaa tha, kyonki yah satta ke sabase bade haakim se bhi sawaal poochne kii chhot detaa he
 The Westminster model of democracy has a question hour tradition in Parliament in which the Prime Minister is also responsible for questions as a minister
 adhyakshiya loktantr main is tarah kii parampara nahin he
 Do not stop the questions from rising, otherwise you do not know how many will be choked
 sayaanon ne bhi hamen sikhaaya tha ki koi prashn moorkhtapurna nahin hota, kyonki murkh kabhi sawaal nahin poochhate

 Input IANS rajasthan ke purv mantri babulal nagar ke khilaaf ek nayaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The minor has given a statement in front of the magistrate against the former minister that the people of Nagar gangraped him by keeping him in his house
 nagar ke hi vidhansabha kshetra kii rahanevaali 16 saal kaa naaballig ladki ne magistrate ke saamne bayaan diya he
 The girl alleged that seven people abducted her and kept her in the house of Prithviraj Nagar of Babulal Nagar in Jaipur and gangraped
 uske baad khud babulal nagar ne use dhamkee di ki kahin muh kholaa to uske or uske parivaar ko maar daalaa jayega
 In the second lawsuit filed against the women's organizations, Nagar has also accused the government of not taking action
 mahila sanghathanon kaa aarope he ki ek naaballig ne pichley saal magistrate ke saamne apane 164 ke bayaan main kaha tha ki nagar ke longon ne uskaa apharan kar samuhik balaatkaar kiya or kai dinon tak nagar ke ghar par rakhaa
 But the police did nothing and the victim family, fearing civil threats, finally left Rajasthan and went to Gujarat
 saamaajik kaaryakarta sukhpreet bansal ne kaha ki ‘ladki ne apane 164 ke bayaan main kaha he ki babulal nagar ne phone par dhamkee di ki kisi ko kuch kaha to tuje or tere parivaar ko jaan se maar daalenge
 The girl was later kept in the house of Prithviraj Nagar in Nagar for two weeks
 ’purv mantri par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaanevaali peedita ne phir aarope lagaaya he ki police suraksha ke baavjood use dhamkiyaan mil rahi he or ghar chhodane kaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 The victim has also questioned the government's intention of not arresting Nagar yet
 udhar sibiai ko jaanch shuru kiye paanch din biit jane ke baavjood babulal nagar se poochtacha nahi hui he
 The victim, who accused former Rajasthan Dairy Minister Babulal Nagar of rape, has once again said that she is still receiving threats and being chased
 peedita ne kaha ki us par ye bhi dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he ki wo apana ghar chhodkar kahin or chali jaae
 After the threats received last time, the state government has provided police protection to the victim
 ’ peedita ne kaha ki mere or mere parivaar ko khatra he, mujhe ab bhi dhamkee mil rahi he ki yahaan se chhodkar chali jaao
 'police has taken the victim's statement thrice and has interrogated 24 times
 iske pehle magistrate ke saamne 164 ke bayaan bhi ho chuke hai
 The CBI has also interrogated the victim for two hours and said that she will be questioned again
 jabaki babulal nagar se ab tak poochtacha nahin hui he
 The victim objected to Nagar's statement to the police that she had intimate relations with the victim and often met at a place outside the house
 peedita ise nagar kii sajeesh bataa rahi he
 The victim has alleged that the investigation has not yet been corrected
 peedita ne kaha ki ‘jaanch sahi disha main hoti to nagar ab tak giraftaar ho gaya hota
 The lawyers are also saying that after the arrest, there should have been a medical and DNA test, but nothing like this is being done

 netaa bhi man masoskar rah ja rahe hai
 What did the Election Commission do in the election season? The leaders cannot even secretly join the Ravana Army or the Vanar Sena by putting on masks, as Election Commission cameras are constantly keeping a close watch on Leela forums

 For this, the Ramlila committees had to lobby
 apane kaaryakartaaon ke saath lila sthal par pahunchakar apni lokapriyata kaa graph ooncha dikhaane kaa bhi mauka hota tha
 This time the leaders are afraid of even the invitation letter of Ramlila
 unka asli dar yah he ki aachaar samhita kii 'lakshmana rekha' paar karte hi 'rambaan' lag jayega
 When Ravan dies, then he will die, but his political career will collapse without getting a ticket
 dilli kaint main sadar bazaar main pichley saath saal se ho rahi raghunandan lila samiti ke adhyaksh deepak singhl ke mutabik, pehali baar chunaav ayog ke shikanje kii vajah se vidhayak or tikat ke daavedaar hi nahin, balki saansad tak lila manch tak aane se kataraa rahe hai, jabaki lila shuru hone se pehle unhone apane aane kii taarikh tak tay kar di thi
 Now as soon as the order of the Election Commission came, everyone got 'satak Sitaram'
 koi is babat baat karne ko bhi taiyaar nahin he
 Mohanlal, an official of the Election Commission monitoring team, says that he sends his report to the commission daily along with video recordings of the Ramlilaon stage
 iske baad chunaav ayog tay karata he ki aachaar samhit kaa ulanghan kahaan or kis tarah hua he
 Accordingly, it will be decided where and what action is needed

 kaashi vishwanath mandir nyaas parishad kii baithak main liya faislamandir main 200-250 litre doodh kii roj hoti he khapedgar aap varanasi main sthit baba kaashi vishwanath main aasthaa rakhte hai to ye khabar aapke liye behad jaruri he kyonki kaashi vishwanath mandir nyaas parishad ne baba vishwanath par chadhane vaale packet ke doodh par tatkaal prabhaav se roak laga diya he
 What is the reason? Among the twelve Jyotirlingas, Sarvoparibaba Kashi Vishwanath will no longer be able to offer pasteurized milk of the packet as only raw milk can be offered on the Shivling in classical legislation
 unka kahana he ki packet kaa milk kai baar garm or thanda karne kii prakriya se gujarata he
 This decision has been taken in the Vishwanath Temple Trust Council meeting
 faisle ke bare main zyada jaankaree dete hue kaashi vishwanath mandir nyaas parishad ke esadm vinod singh bataate hai ki nyaas parishad kii baithak main yah faisla liya gaya he ki packet ke doodh shastreey paddati ke anusaar shivlinga par chadhaane yogya nahin hai
 They say that this milk is of several days and it is heated and cooled several times under the process
 amul doodh kii briki par lagi rokais faisle ke baad se mandir parisar main purv main sthapit amul doodh ke counter se bhi amul doodh kii briki par roak laga di gai he
 At the same time, the temple complex has started selling milk of its own cowshed
 mandir prashasan ke alaava jo shraddhalu baahar se bhi doodh laakar chadhaate hai to uski gunvattta bhi samay-samay par check kii jaati he
 Because there was a chemical complaint in the external milk also
 isliye shuddh bahari doodh bhi baba kaashi vishwanath par chadhaaya ja saktaa he
 SDM Vinod Singh said that about 200-250 liters of milk is consumed daily for milking and if there is less milk than Kashiwashwanath's cowshed, then the shortage will be done by taking milk from outside gopalakas too
 dukandaaron ne jataayaa virodevahin mandir ke baahar ke dukandaar vishwanath mandir kii ore se lagaae jane vaale nae pratibandhon ko galat bataa rahe hai
 Many shopkeepers told about selling packet milk, while many gave information about bringing cow's milk from the market
 dukandaaron kaa kahana he ki is faisle se na keval dukandaar balki aane vaale shraddhaluon ko bhi dikkat hogi
 Many pujas are not available from inside the temple and cannot be bought from outside shops, which causes a lot of trouble

 After the last royal bath of Vasant Panchami at the world's largest religious congregation (mahakumbh Mela) running on the Sangam coast in Tirtharaj, Prayag, the akhadas are now covering their beds
 ek baar phir naga sanyasi desh-duniya ke liye adrishy ho jaaenge or inkaa jivan phir se rahasyamay ho jayega
 Although there are two royal baths (maghi Purnima and Mahashivratri) still left in the Mahakumbh Mela, but Naga Sadhu of Akharas considers Vasant Panchami as his last royal bath, concluding the Mahakumbh fair
 15 farvari ko sampann hue vasant panchami ke snaan parv ke baad ab akhaade meley se vidaai lene lage hai
 The sages and nagas of all the 13 akharas who have come to attend the Mahakumbh Mela have started from here and have left for their city of Kashi, including their own beds
 kaashi main manaayenge holiatal akhaade ke mahant anandeshwar swami kaa kahana he ki akhaadon ke sadhu or naga ab mahakumbh se prasthaan ke baad kaashi main ek maheene tak rahenge or vahaan holi kaa tyohaar dhooma-dham se manaayenge
 After that they would disappear into caves and tendons

 One has to wait for six years to see these Naga ascetics
 dharm kii raksha ke liye naga bane sanyasiyon kaa jivan hameshaa rahasyamayi rahaa he
 Where do they come from and where do they go, why are they never seen apart from Kumbh, they also have answers to these questions
 ab phir gufaaon main laut jaaengesoona akhaade ke pravaktaa mahant hari giri kaa kahana he ki akhaadon main aae ye naga sanyasi kandaraon or gufaaon se mahakumbh meley aae the or ab phir ye vahiin laut jaaenge
 He said that many Naga sannyasis will move to the caves or hills of Junagadh in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat
 naga sanyasi in gufaaon main maheenon rahenge or phir kisi duusari gupha main chale jaaenge
 In the same way, these Nagas immersed in devotion to the caves and Bhole Baba will spend their lives on the help of herbs and tubers
 jangalon main ghoomte aise hi naagaon kaa samay biit jayega or agle ardhakumbh main jab ye gufaaon se baahar niklenge to phir puri duniya rahasyamayi naagaon ke darshan karegi
 Some Naga saints will do austerity by wearing clothes and some nude will stay in a secret place
 ardhakumbh ke maukey par logon ke saamne aaenge

 Becoming a father under the age of 25 can prove dangerous
 nae shodh ke anusaar, kam umr main pita banane se jaldi maut ho sakati he
 Evidence has shown that young men who become fathers at an early age do not have good health and die earlier than those who become fathers at an early age
 shodhakartaaon ne ullekh kiya he kisi ko kam umr main pita banane ke liye paariwarik vaataavaran, saamaajik aarthik paristhitiyaan or jin ko jimmedaar mana ja saktaa he
 The comments nishkarsh tak pahunchane ke liye shodhakartaaon ne 1950 finnish janaganana ke ek rashtriya pratinidhi namoonay kaa istemaal kiya
 It included 30,500 men born between 1940 and 1950, who became fathers at the age of 45
 vahiin 1985-2006 kaa mrityu dar data upyog kiya gaya jisamen 45 or 54 saal tak ke pitaaon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 In this, men who became fathers from 25 to 26 years were taken as references
 isamen paaya gaya ki 25yaa 26 kii apeksha 22 saal kii umr main pita banane waalon main maut kaa khatra 26 pratishat zyada hota he
 Similarly, a person who becomes a father at the age of 22 or 24 years, his risk of death is 14 percent higher
 iske saath 25-26 saal kii umr main pita banane kii bajaay 30 or 44 saal kii umr main pita banane waalon main maut kaa khatra 25 pratishat kam hota he
 With this, becoming a father at the age of 27 and 29 is also dangerous
 iske alaava lekhak ne suzav diya he ki kam umr ke pita apane bachche ke achche vyavhaar ko badhaava de sakate hai
 Researchers used a nationally representative sample of the 1950 Finnish census to reach conclusions
 isamen 1940 or 1950 ke bich paidaa hue 30,500 purushon ko shamil kiya gaya, jo 45 saal kii umr main pita bane
 On the other hand, mortality data for 1985–2006 were used in which fathers aged 45 and 54 died
 isamen 25 se 26 saal tak pita banane vaale purushon ko sandarbh ke taur par liya gaya
 It was found that the risk of death among those who become father at the age of 22 is 26 percent more than 25 or 26
 isi tarah jo vyakti 22 yaa 24 saal kii umr main hi pita ban jaataa he, uski maut kaa khatra 14 pratishat adhik hota he
 With this, instead of becoming a father at the age of 25-26 years, the risk of death among those who become a father at the age of 30 and 44 is 25 percent less
 iske saath 27 or 29 saal kii umr main pita bananaa bhi khatarnaak he
 In addition, the author suggests that younger fathers may promote good behavior for their child
 isamen paaya gaya ki 25yaa 26 kii apeksha 22 saal kii umr main pita banane waalon main maut kaa khatra 26 pratishat zyada hota he
 Similarly, a person who becomes a father at the age of 22 or 24 years, his risk of death is 14 percent higher
 iske saath 25-26 saal kii umr main pita banane kii bajaay 30 or 44 saal kii umr main pita banane waalon main maut kaa khatra 25 pratishat kam hota he

 ' Most of us spend most hours of our day sitting in front of the screen
 wo chaahe computer screen ho yaa phir mobile screen
 Sitting in front of a digital screen for hours has the worst effect on our eyes
 jisase tanaav, anidra or kai duusari bimariyon ke hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 This problem related to the eyes is called Digital Eye Strain
 Digital Eye Strain ko hi pehle computer vision syndrome ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 This disease is increasing day by day in people
 pehle sirf computer par kaam hota tha lekin ab laptop, tablets, smart phone bhi hamaari jindagi kaa ahm hissaa ban chuke hai
 Digital Eye Strain becomes a problem due to excessive use of these things
 isaki shuruyaat ankhon main halke dard se ho sakati he
 But if the treatment is not done in time, then the eyesight can also go in the future
 Digital Eye Strain ke shuruaati lakshan:ankhon main khinchaav mahasoos hona, ankhon main pani aana, dard hona, dhundhala dikhnaa, lala hona, iske shuruaati lakshan hai
 Also, there may be headache and nervousness
 kai baar ye chidchidepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 It may be that you have less trouble in the morning, but as the day progresses, this problem starts to increase
 rokthaam or upachaar-1
 It has become our need to use digital products
 aise main hamen unke istemaal kaa sahi tarika bhi pataa hona chahie
 It can be dangerous to use these things very near or far from the eyes
 in chizon ko ek nishchit duuri par rakhkar hi istemaal karnaa chahie
 2
 jis kamare main baithkar aap in chizon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai vahaan paryaapt roshni honi chahie
 Otherwise the eyes will be stressed
 3
 The office should not sit in front of the AC vent
 isse ankhon kaa pani suukh jaataa he
 Rules of 20-20-20 should be followed
 jo log offis main computer or laptop main der tak kaam karte hai, unhen har 20 minute par 20 feet dur par rakhi cheez ko 20 second ke liye dekhnaa chahie
 It reduces eye strain
 4
 The screen should not be too bright and the font size should not be too small
 5
 When you work on the computer for a long time, your eyelashes blink 6-8 times in a minute while blinking of the eyelids 16-18 times is normal
 aise main aavashyak rup se har chah maheene main ekbar ankhon kii jaanch kara len
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was dreaming of defeating the BJP in the assembly elections of the three states, but the BSP President Mayawati has thrown all the hopes of Rahul Gandhi
 mayawati ne saaf kaha ki rajasthan or madhya pradesh main congress ke sathgathabandhananhin karegi
 While the BSP has already rebelled against the Congress in Chhattisgarh and formed an alliance with Ajit Jogi, who formed a separate party
 mayawati ke tevar se saaf ho gaya ki teenon rajyon main congress ke saath basapa gathbandhan kii sari ummiden khatm ho gai hai
 With the BSP not coming to the Congress, the BJP is once again looking to retain power
 teen rajyon main hone hai chunaavmadhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main isi saal oktober-november main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 There are BJP governments in these three states
 empi or chhattisgarh kii satta main bijepi 15 saal se kabiz he
 In these two states, the Congress leaders were trying for an alliance with the BSP, but on Wednesday, Mayawati has deflated all plans
 basapa-congress na hone se shivaraj kii ummid jaagimadhya pradesh main takreeban 15 fisadi dalit matadaata hai
 In 2013, BSP fielded candidates in 227 out of 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 basapa yahaan 6
 It managed to win four seats with 42 per cent of the vote
 rajya main 75 se 80 siton par basapa pratyaashiyon ne 10 hajaar se zyada vot hasil kiye the
 Whereas there were 17 seats where the BSP candidates secured more than 35 thousand votes
 bijepi or congress ke bich 8
 There was a difference of 4 percent vote share
 bijepi ko 165 siten or congress ko 58 siten mili thim
 In such a situation, Shivraj's equation could have deteriorated if both of them had entered the electoral battle
 chitrakoot vidhansabha seat par upachunaav main basapa ke na ladane kaa phayda congress ko mila tha
 In view of this, the Congress was trying to contest elections with parties like BSP and Gondwana Ganatantra Party
 lekin mayawati buudhvaar ko congress ke saath gathbandhan ke kayaason par purnaviram laga diya he
 bsp's base in Madhya Pradesh is quite good in areas adjacent to UP
 chambal, bundelkhand or baghelkhand ke kshetra main basapa kii acchhee khaasi pakad he
 The absence of the BSP with the Congress is considered a good sign for Shivraj
 rajasthan main hathi bigaadega haath khelrajasthan main kareeb 17 fisadi dalit matadaata hai
 The BJP has 163 seats out of the total 200 seats in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly
 2013 main hue chunaav main bijepi ne 45
 Had secured 2% votes
 jabaki congress 33
 21 seats and 3 with 1%
 4% vot ke saath basapa 3 siten jeet pai thi
 The BSP was runner-up in three seats and contested the BJP
 jabaki 2008 main basapa ne 6 siten jeetne ke saath 7
 It had secured 6 percent votes
 dilachasp baat ye he ki daliton kii party kahi jane vaali basapa ko teenon jeet saamaanya siton par hi mili thim
 While the BJP won 33 seats out of 34 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and one seat was won by others
 vidhansabha chunaav main har baar kii bhaanti is baar bhi 3 se 4 pratishat vot swing hone kii sthiti main parinaam kaaphi badal saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Congress wants that the BSP gets the vote so that it can directly prevent the BJP from coming to power, but Mayawati has turned these hopes on the Congress
 chhattisgarh main bijepi-congress ke bich ek fisadi kaa antarchhattisgarh main raman singh ke netritv main bijepi teen baar se satta par kabiz he
 But there is only one percent difference between Congress and BJP
 basapa ko pichley chunaav main 4
 5 percent votes were received
 2013 ke chunaav main rajya kii 90 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi ne 49 siten jiti thim
 While Congress got 39 seats and BSP one seat
 saath ladate to alag hoti tasvirbaspa-congress ek saath milakar chunavi jang main utarate to rajya kii raajnneetik tasviir badal jane kii sambhaavna thi
 Had the BSP and Congress come together in 2013, the results would have been different
 bijepi ko 11 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padataa or 38 siten milteen
 Whereas the congress-bsp alliance would have come to power with 51 seats
 yahi vajah thi ki congress ke pradesh adhyaksh lagaataar basapa ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat rah the, lekin baaji congress se baghawat kar alag party banane vaale ajit jogi ke haath lagi he
 In 2013, the BSP managed to win the Jaizepur assembly seat
 jabaki pamgarh or chandrapur main basapa duusare sthaan par rahi
 Apart from this, BSP candidates finished third in Alaktara, Biligarh and Sargund
 mayawati or jogi ke bich hue gathbandhan main 35 siten basapa ke khate main ai hai or 55 siton par jogi janata congress ko mili he
 While Jogi has a tribal vote, the BSP has a good hold over Dalit voters
 aise main congress ko basapa ke alag chunaav ladane kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The bsp's lack of association with the Congress is considered a blow to Rahul Gandhi's opposition unity
 iske chalate congress ko jahaan madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Apart from this, it is difficult to say that the BSP remained with the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 basapa 2019 main bhi isi tarah se alag hokar ladati he to congress ko kai rajyon main dalit maton kaa nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 After the BJP and Congress, the BSP is the only party with a national base

 Naveen Chawla will be the next Chief Election Commissioner
 raashtrapati pratibha patil ne iske liye manjuuri de di he
 Chawla will take over on April 20
 gauratlab he ki vartmaan mukhya chunaav ayukta en gopalswami ne chawla par ranithik dalon se pakshpaat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue raashtrapati se unki barkhaastagi kii maang kii thi
 For this, Gopalaswamy also wrote a letter to the President
 raashtrapati ne unki maang ko baad main khaarij kar diya tha
 There was also a lot of controversy after Gopalaswamy's letter
 bhaajapa ne jahaan ise uchit kadam tehraaya tha vahiin congress iskaa virodh kar rahi thi
 Significantly, the BJP first accused Chawla of colluding with political parties
 lekin raashtrapati kii manjuuri ke baad ab chawla ke mukhya chunaav ayukta banane ke raste main koi aadchan nahin he
 On the other hand, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court against Naveen Chawla
 yachika main chawla ke chunaav ayukta bane rahane ko chunauti di gai he
 The court has approved the petition for hearing and now it will be heard on 20 March
 kisi raajnneetik party ne yah yachika daayar kii he
 Political thinker KN Govindacharya has said that the alliance of BJP and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir will be 'immoral'
 govindacharya ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, jammu-kashmir main bijepi or pidipi ke bich yadi gathbandhan hota he, to vah aniatik gathbandhan hoga
 He said that long term loss is not right for short term gain and it would be unfair for BJP
 govindacharya kii yah tippanee jammu-kashmir main bijepi or pidipi dwaara gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ke bich ai he
 In the recently concluded assembly elections, PDP won 28 seats and BJP 25 seats
 unhone centre sarkaar kii nitiyon par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, modi kii niyat par andeh nahin he, lekin nitiyon or nitiyon kii praathamikta par aitraaj he
 
 
 The country needs poor policies, but the government is giving rich policies
 bhoomi adhigrahan adhyadesh ko kisaanon ke liye 'jaanaleva' bataate hue unhone kaha ki is adhyadesh se kisaanon or desh kaa nahin, balki audyogic gharaanon kaa vikaas hoga
 Govindacharya alleged that just as the previously acquired lands are either lying abandoned or used by industrial houses, similarly the land acquired under the current Land Acquisition Ordinance is also only for industrial houses
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan endie sarkaar ke ghatak dalon ne pichhali sarkaar ke adhigrahan adhyadesh ke khilaaf jansamarthan hasil kiya tha, lekin sarkaar main aane ke baad endie ke log pichhali sarkaar se bhi zyada khatarnaak adhyadesh lekar aae hai
 This should not be acceptable in any way

 lg's Delhi press release has said that "the truth behind 400 files should be revealed to the public"
 agar sab kuch kanuunan sahi he jaisaa ki daawa kiya gaya to chuni hui sarkaar sach ke saamne aane se dar kyon rahi he? kuch maamalon main aisi galtiyaan dikhi he, jinke chalate wo sibiai ko jaanch ke liye bheje ja rahe hai'
 LG said that they were surprised that the Delhi cabinet called the Shunglu committee unconstitutional
 alji ne kaha ki filon ko alji daphtar ne talab yaa zabt nahin kiya, balki ye wo filein hai jo khud sarkaar ke mantriyon ne bheji, kyonki wo khud maanate hai ki usne isamen tay prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya
 According to LG, the committee will submit its report in the next 6 weeks
 isse pehle dilli sarkaar kii cabinet ne ek sankalp paarit karke dilli ke alji najeeb jang ko shungalu samiti bhang karne kii maang kii
 Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia gave this information to the media at a press conference

 We have the right to advise LG sir
 isaliye hamane salaah dete hue kaha ki is samiti ko bhang kiya jaae'

 Indian security agencies have been successful in preparing to bring back Nirav Modi, the main accused in the Punjab National Bank scam
 antarrashtriya agency interpol ne neerav modi ke khilaaf red corner notice jari kiya he, isaki apil bhartiya agenciyon ne hi kii thi
 Will it really help in finding any way to find Nirav Modi and bring him back to India? ye dekhnaa hoga, red corner notice jari hone se kya fark padegaa yahaan samajhie
 
 
 Will arrest be easy? Actually, when some kind of extradition case comes up, then this notice is issued to know the location of a particular person
 haalanki, ise sidhe taur par giraftaar warrant nahin mana jaataa he
 Interpol only states under this notice that an arrest warrant is issued against this particular person in any country, it is entirely up to that country what action he takes on it
 red corner notice interpol ke sadsy desh ke anurodh par pradhan sachivalay dwaara kisi apradhi ke khilaaf sadsy desh dwaara giraftaar warrant ke aadhaar par jari kiya jaataa he
 In the case of Nirav Modi, it has been released at the request of the Government of India
 isse pehle daaud ke maamle main bhi aisa hi hua tha
 This notice applies to the 192 member countries of Interpol
 or kitnon ke khilaaf jari he notice?aisa pehali baar nahin he ki bharat ke kehane par kisi ke khilaaf red corner notice jari hua ho
 In the past, it has been issued against about 160 people, including big names including Masood Azhar, Dawood Ibrahim
 hawaii yatraaen hongi mushkil
 
 kai baar is prakaar kii khabaren ai ki neerav modi lagaataar kai deshon kii yatraaen kar rahaa he, lekin ab uske liye ye aasaan nahin hoga
 In 192 countries, it will be difficult to travel under Nirav
 haalanki, aisa jaruri nahin ki vah airport par giraftaar hoga
 For example, Christian Michael against whom such a notice was issued in 2013, although he has not been able to come to India till date
 hameshaa ke liye nahin he notice
 
 
 It is not that if an Interpol notice is issued against a person, it will be there forever
 isse pehle jab lalit modi ke khilaaf ye notice jari kiya gaya tha ki to unke vakil kii aapatti ke baad ye hat gaya tha
 Have you ever been successful? It is not that success has never been achieved
 2015 main daaud kaa kareeb chota rajan bhi isi notice kii vajah se bharat aa paaya tha
 At the same time, in 2002, Abu Salem was also caught in India for this reason
 aapako bataa den ki neerav modi par punjab neshnal bank se kareeb 13,000 karod rupye kaa ghapala karne kaa aarope he
 Nirav issued a fake LOU and took loan from the bank and now escaped
 interpol ne apni website par bhi neerav modi ke khilaaf jari red corner notice kii jaankaree di he
 Recently, the ED recommended it to Interpol after releasing its charge sheet
 is notice main neerav modi kii tasviir ke saath-saath uski jaankaree or usapar lage charge bhi hai

 Now the question is, how did such a big carelessness while making overbridge? Why was the road not encircled in the same way as it is at the time of construction of the metro line in Delhi
 duusari laaparvaahioverbrij nirmaan ke dauraan sadak par trephic kyon chalane di gai thi? peedblyoody vibhaag ne overbrij banane ke pehle ehtiyaat kyon nahin bartaa? 2019 ke chunaav ke maddenjar pul banane kii jaldbaaji main kya kaam kii quality se samjhauta kiya gaya
 The biggest question is who is responsible for such a big accident? UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed regret over the incident
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi khed jataa diya
 Yogi also announced compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the relatives of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh to the injured
 lekin sarkaar ke is maraham se is haadase par uthte sawaal khatm nahin hote
 These compensation does not equal the account of this accident, this compensation cannot bring back the lives lost in this accident
