 Although India scored a score of 192 after winning the toss of the West Indies, the West Indies won in response to that by batting brilliantly
 toss haar janaa bhi bharat ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 The target of 192 was achieved by the West Indies playing strongly in spite of three wickets
 duusari taraf bharat ke gendbaajon ne aaj sabase kharaab gendbaaji kii
 The West Indies team is considered to be very adept at playing shirt pitch ball and the Indian bowlers bowled a small ball which resulted in West Indies batsmen hitting many sixes
 bharat ke gendbaajon ne kai no ball bhi phenkin jo bharat ke liye ghaatak sabit hua
 Charles survived the dismissal of these no hairs twice and was not out by scoring 82 runs for West Indies
 tippaniyan India's batsmen batted very well
 acchhee shuruyaat ke baavjood bharat 200 ran tak nahin pahunch paaya
 If 20 more runs were scored then the result would have been different
 os bhi bharat kii jeet main roda sabit hui
 Bowling to Indian bowlers was not easy due to dew
 sabase zyada dikkat spin gendbaajon ko ho rahi thi
 The ball was neither spinning nor falling at the right place due to hand slipping
 spin gendbaaj ravichandran asina or rabindra jadeja ne kaaphi ran die
 Pandya and Bumrah also failed to stop the run

 duusari taraf bharat ke gendbaajon ne aaj sabase kharaab gendbaaji kii
 The West Indies team shirt is considered to be quite adept at playing pitch ball and the Indian bowlers bowled short balls which led the West Indies batsmen to hit several sixes

 Despite a good start, India could not reach 200 runs
 agar 20 ran or banate to ho saktaa he rigelt alag hota
 Dew also proved to be a hindrance in India's victory
 os ke kaaran bhartiya gendbaajon ko bowling karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The biggest problem was facing the spin bowlers

 If the pace of global growth is anticipated by the international body IMF in 2018, if it remains the same, it can increase the economy by half percent
 rojgaar ke maukey paidaa karnaa badi chunautidesh main rojgaar ek badi chunauti he
 The survey said that due to lack of comprehensive data on employment in the country, it is very difficult to make any guesses on this front

 The challenge of giving better jobs to the youth of the country will remain in the middle period before the government

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Australian players may have had trouble playing the spinners of the Board President's XI, but opener Ed Cowan believes that the turning wicket actually gave his team a good opportunity to practice before the upcoming Test series

 We need to practice on the balls taking turn
 gend turn le rahi thi or farward difens shaat khelnaa sabase khatarnaak rahaa
 You have to find some other way to score runs
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar aap rakshaatmak ravaiya apanaate ho to phir spinneron ke haathon main khelte ho
 In fact, the player who scored the ball hit the ball instead of just playing defensively
 hamaare ballebaajon ne shot lagaaye lekin ve jis tarah se shot lagaana chaahate the vaisaa nahin laga paye
 "usman tried to sweep but unfortunately the ball did not come properly on his bat
" maine kuch sweep shot khele
 You cannot sweep every ball, it will know about you
 aapako line or length kaa pataa hona chahie
 Matthew Wade played well sweep shots
 chotii ke teen ballebaajon ne sweep kiye
 It is not a question of sweeping every ball as it can put you in more trouble

 Our bowlers know how to reverse the ball at a good speed
 aap jitani tej gend karoge reverse swing khelni utani hi mushkil hoti he

 Manmohan Singh's feat is undesirable
 ve abhi bhi tay nahin kar paa rahe hai ki unhen bharat kii janata ne nirvaachit kiya he yaa sonia gandhi ne chunaa he
 It is worth giving credit to 'both', which runs fine under normal circumstances but gets shattered at the very first signal of a difficult time
 sonia gandhi kii samasya pratikulata kii pechidagi haih aap mukti vahini ko to kah sakate hai ki yah koi sena nahin hoti lekin yah nahin kah sakate ki koi mukti yaa moksh nahin hota
 Rahul Gandhi is not the Congress face of salvation but Manmohan
 yahi sarkaar or party ke bich algaav paidaa karata he
 Hence, senior party officials like Digvijay Singh have no qualms in ignoring Manmohan on their own
 digvijay singh bihar chunaav abhiyaan kii vipadaa yaa tamilnadu main sharmnaak haar ke baad bhi kya rahul gandhi kii aalochana karne kii himmat juta sakate hai? nahin
 They know where the livelihood is in the Congress
 ve unke pratifal hai jo lagaataar maang karte hai ki rahul gandhi ko fouran manmohan kii jagah baithaaya jaae
 The imaginary prime minister has more dominance in the Congress than the national prime minister
 sapanom kaa samrajya khadaa karne vaale ek diggaj vyapaaree kaha karte the ki agar car ek driver chalaa rahaa ho to raste se bhatakane kii sambhaavna hameshaa rahati he; lekin agar do driver hon to car kaa durghatnagrast hona tay he
 The UPA government has three drivers, all sitting in the front seat
 manmohan singh ko car kii chaabi thamaaye bina stearing wheel par baitha diya gaya he
 If nothing progresses, they are convicted
 jab ve koshish karke use aage badhaate hai to driver or dishanirdeshak praayah alag-alag lakshya kii ore bad rahe hote hai
 Sonia Gandhi's agenda is based on populist measures, she believes that those measures will make Rahul Gandhi eligible to be elected; Manmohan is limited in the limits of financial responsibilities
 bhrashtachar ke kshayakaari prabandhan yaa kuprabandhan samet har mudde se aantarik virodhabhas jhlakane lagate hai
 Manmohan became Prime Minister in 2004 but had to share power with a higher authority
 2007 ke baad unhen apane pad ke visheshadhikaron se bhi vanchit kar diya gaya
 He is rushed to such a waiting room where he has to wait till the day Rahul Gandhi becomes fully ready to do his favor by becoming the Prime Minister
 lekin raashtra ke paas aise pradhanmantri par afsos jataane kaa vakt nahin he jo apane jaij adhikaar bhi nahin jataata
 Every waiting room has a door
 aap hameshaa usee daravaaje se baahar nikal sakate hai, jisase andar jate hai
 Manmohan seems to be fiercely strutting instead of moving, whether he is in control or exiting
 yah akadan unki swar nalee main bhi he kyonki aise maahaul main vinamrata saaf jhlak sakati he jisamen unke party netaaon ko saarvajanik rup se un par tanjakarne kii ijaajat he
 Manmohan is a humble man, but an effective prime minister is not forced to admit his mistake in a situation of embarrassment
 unhen lambey samay se apni swar nalee ko dhili karne ke liye manaaya ja rahaa he, or hamen pataa chalaa he ki ve media ke saath ''niyamit'' rup se, shaayad har hafte chaay pienge
 It is always better to talk to the messenger than to kill him, but here surely the question arises whether there is a solution to the contradictions that have held the regime
 koi sarkaar shashan ke bina kitne lambey samay tak bani rah sakati he? iskaa takneekee jawaab sabko maaloom he
 a majority in Parliament is often described as "cruel" because it can be impregnable for public sentiment
 agar congress maanati he ki sarkaar or vipaksh, donon ho sakati he, vah satta ke laabh uthaate hue ek bali ke bakre pradhanmantri ke khilaaf janabhaavnaaen bhadkaa sakati he to use agle chunaav main mahangi keemat chukaani hogi
 Repeatability does not work
 manmohan kam bolne vaale aise insaan hai, jinaki bhavanaaen shaayad hi dikhti hai
 But they do not hide their trouble for long
 unhone saarvajanik taur par kabhi kahkahe nahin lagaae, yahaan tak ki khushi kii ghadiyon main bhi nahin, lekin unhone yada-kada vah muskaan bikheri jo unki daadhiyon se footkar baahar nikali, bahut saadagi ke saath
 He resigned after the victory over the Nuclear Bill, which set the mood for re-election in 2009
 apni jindagi ke behtareen palon ke do saal ke bheetar hi unki muskaan gaayab ho gai he
 They should either bring that smile or go home

 ”- Konkona Sensharma (@konkonas) September 6, 2018 What is in section 377? Section 377 refers to 'unnatural sexual relations as a crime
 iske mutabik jo bhi prakruti kii vyavastha ke vipareet kisi purush, mahila yaa pashu ke saath younachaar karata he, use umrakaid yaa das saal tak kii kaid or jurmaane kii sajaa ho sakati he

 The issue was first raised by the NGO Naz Foundation in 2001 in the Delhi High Court
 hoicourt ne sahmati se do vayaskon ke bich samalangik rishte ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar karte hue isse sambandhit praavdhaan ko 2009 main gaiyr kanoonee ghoshit kar diya tha
 An Assistant Chef about Amitabh Bachchan told, 'we had planned that we will serve Amitabh Bachchan with kebabs and mutton dishes like Nihari, but he likes to eat vegetarian food
 ' shef ke mutabik amitabh bachchan (amitabh Bachchan) brakefast ke dauraan ek gilaas doodh or bina mirch vaali andonki bhurji hi lete hai
 During lunch, Amitabh Bachchan likes to eat only two to three rotis, pulses and green vegetables
 amitabh bachchan chaaval khaane se bachate hai
 The chef told that only one day Amitabh Bachchan asked for Paneer Bhurji
 uske alaava unhone kabhi kuch or khaane kii demand nahin kii
 When they are late from the shooting, they only take soup at dinner
 yahaan tak ki kuch din unhone keval soup hi liya or khaane se parhez kiya
 a member of the film crew told that Amitabh Bachchan is the most simple actor on the set
 unhone bataaya kii amitabh bachchan kabhi set par kisi vishesh bhojan ke liye koi anurodh nahin karte balki wo sirf muramureor chane jo set par sabake liye hote hai, vahikhaate hai
 Amitabh Bachchan's passion for Bollywood and cinematographers seems to be increasing with his age, and this can be gauged by watching the trailer of his upcoming film Wazir
 film main ahm kirdaar adaa kar rahe mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne apni is film ko lekar kai baaten ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main share kii
 In a special conversation with Rajdeep Sardesai, consulting editor of India Today Group, Amitabh answered many questions
 aaie jaanate hai kya kaha big star big bi ne:is umr main bhi yang stars ke saath aap ek ke baad ek filmein kar rahe hai itnaa pishan kaise aata he?main apane har din ko chunauti kii tarah dekhtaa hum, har roj kuch nayaa seekhney kii koshish karata rahata hum or karata rahoonga
 Tell me about your character in the film 'wazir'? The film 'wazir' is a very powerful film, its biggest feature is the story of the film which goes ahead with the game of chess
 is film main main ek kashmiri pandit ke kirdaar main hum jinka naam 'onkaar nath dhar' he
 He belongs to Kashmir but now lives in Delhi
 ek ghatana kii vajah se unhone apni taange kho di hai or shatranj ke khel main bahut maahir hai, bacchon ko shatarant bhi sikhaate hai
 But he has a special motive, a pain whose fight he fights in the style of Shataranj
 is tarah se film main aapako shatranj ke khel kaa har kirdaar dekhne ko milegaa phir chaahe vah vajeer ho, pyaadaa ho yaa phir ghoda
 There are reports of clashes between FTII students and Gajendra Chauhan once again, what would you like to say on this, your wife Jaya Bachchan has also been a well-known student of this institute? See, i have not been a student of this institute, so i Can not say anything about this, yes, if she is living, then she can answer this question better
 kaha jaataa tha ki kaala pathar film ke dinon main aapke or shatrughna ke bich kuch man mutaav kii kaaphi charchaa rahi thi or shatrughna par haalia relies biography Anything but Khamosh main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 Shatrughan says that Amitabh was jealous of my stardom? Do you still have estrangement between me? There was never any conflict between me and Shatrughan ji
 yahaan tak kii haal hi main unki kitaab main is kitaab kii riter bharti pradhan ne mujhase shatrughna ke bare main kuch sawaal poochne ke liye sampark bhi kiya
 i would like to say one thing, i highly admire the two men of the industry, one of whom is Vinod Khanna and the other is Shatrughan Sinha
 kyonki in donon ne hi har tarah ke role adaa kiye
 Shatrughan Sinha proved himself well as a hero from Villain and i did only hero films
 iske alaava donon hi stars ne raajnneeti main bhi kadam rakhaa usamen bhi safal rahe, lekin main raajnneeti main fail ho gaya
 In this way, i consider Shatrughan Sinha more capable and successful than me
 aap kab apni kitaab likhenge?hansate hue, mere paas kitaab likhane ke liye saamagree nahin he or mujhapar par aadhaarit kitaab boring hogi
 Even at this age you only sleep for 5 hours or less? Why this? i sleep at 2 pm because at that time i talk with the fans of my country and abroad on social media
 videsh ke samay main or hamaare desh ke samay main antar hone kii vajah se sone main der ho hi jaati he
 When do you spend time with your granddaughter Aaradhya? Whenever she gets time, she spends time with them, cannot spend much time because she too goes out of the country for work with her parents Huh
 sach kahen to mujhe time management bilkul nahin aata, jaise hi shooting ke liye kol aayaa to shooting ke liye nikal lete hai
 What are your upcoming projects? Besides Vazir, 3 more films are coming this year
 jinamein se ek 'ankhe 2' he,'tii3en'he, ek film shujit sarkaar kii he jisaki shooting dilli main shuru hogi, yah film soshal awarenes ke mudde par besd he, ek or film he jiske bare main abhi kuch nahin bataa saktaa
 Apart from films, i am also contracted for a TV show when there is no information about when the shooting will start
 dekhen amitabh bachchan kaa ajtak ke saath film 'vajeer' ko lekar EXCLUSIVE intervyuu: Actress Kangana Ranot has paid her respects to the Indian Army through a video
 ek bayaan ke anusaar, 'lav yor country' sheershak vaale is gaan ko shuukravaar ko online jari kiya gaya
 The video also focuses on social issues such as rape, female feticide, child marriage, dowry and apathy
 kareeb teen minute ke video menkanganasainikon ko salaami dete hue najar aa rahi hai
 The anthem is sung by Siddharth Sharma, Piyush Wasnik and Yash Chauhan
 is gaan menkanganasafed kapade main 'du you vot' bolti hui najar aa rahi hai
 At the same time, Kangna has also supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Clean India campaign in another video before this
 is video main vah logon ko 'clinaliles ij next tu godlines' kaa sandesh detii huin najar ain thi
 Watch video 
 
 kai baar aapaki mohatarama aap par bhadak padati hongi or aap sir khujate rah jate honge ki bhala kis baat par vah itani naaraaz hai
 Actually, the fault is neither theirs nor yours
 baat sirf yah he ki mahilaon ko purushon kii kuch aadaten pasand nahin aatin
 What are those habits, do not let go and do those things from the beginning
 
 
 apni aiyyaashi, chipa kar hi rakhenhakikat main aapaki saathi ko is baat se koi pareshaani nahin hogi ki aap apane kapade kahin ke kahin patake dete hai
 But she will definitely have problems when she sees empty glass or bottles rolling in the entire house after your party with friends made in their absence
 isliye unke aane se pehle yah sab saaf kar dene main hi bhalaai hoti he
 Do not inquire more
 Both of you are working and share each other's account, so do not talk about their purchase
 agar vah aapse kabhi aapaki partiyon par hue kharch kaa hisaab nahin maangati, to badale main apni shopping ko lekar bhi kisi tarah kii rokatoke kii ummid nahin rakhti
 In such a situation, she has bought something new from the market or has come to spend a lot on her look or hair cut, so do not ask questions about how much money she has shed on it
 bas unke luk kii tarif karen or nai cheez ke badale main party maang len yaa dene kaa vaada karen
 So that peace is not spent behind the money that has been spent
 lekin haa, aapke is vyavhaar ke baad vah mil kar agle maheene main paise bachaane kaa plan jarur bana lengi
 Do not call them with a surname even when you are talking, because the first thing that will come in their mind is that you are planning a breakup from them
 bas phir kya, aapkaa mood kitna hi romantic kyon na ho vah apane man main aapako lekar brallep kii baton main kho jaanegi
 And yes, women do not like to talk in code language or numbers
 bhale hi unhen gym jaakar aapkaa workout karnaa pasand ho, lekin vah is baat main jaraa bhi ruchi nahin leti ki aapane gym main kya kya workout kiye
 So please be careful while talking to them
 bhavishya main unhen den jagaukasar dekhne main aata he ki purush apane bhavishya ko lekar khaase sajag hote hai
 But the trouble is there, when he talks about his future, but does not keep his girlfriend somewhere in that frame
 aisa karne se unke man main yah sanshay ho uth saktaa he ki aap unhen lekar gambhir nahin hai
 So if you do not want to annoy your girlfriends, then definitely add them in your future plans
 badlaav, bilkul nahinaapane unhen paa liya he, ek patni yaa garlfriend ke taur par vah aapse judy hai
 Everything is going well, but if you stop trying to attract them, you may have to take them
 mahilaon ko yah badlaav katai pasand nahin
 She would not like to see any change in your behavior after you were tied to marriage or love
 29 saal kii priti kaa kahati hai ‘‘main or meraa premi ab shaadishuda hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah to nahin ki vah meraa dil jeetne kii koshish na kare
 'if you expect your partner after marriage or after being bound in love, now a little seriousness will come in his behavior
 to aap bilkul galat hai
 She will always want the same behavior as you, while proposing to her
 aap jaraa badale nahin ki gaye kaam se
 Careful on their computers, women have no idea what you do at night in their beds, often looking for porn on the Internet
 lekin haa, agar aise computer par porn dekh rahe hai, jise vah bhi istemaal karti hai, to history delit karnaa na bhoolen
 Because even though they are not averse to watching your porn, they will not like to open a porn site repeatedly while doing some searching on the internet

 The threat of floods in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam has been averted due to the artificial lake created after landslides in Tibet
 china ne somvaar ko yah raahat kii khabar di

 ) adaalat se 2 saal kii sazaa, or vidhansabha se sadsyta ganvaane ke baad pawai se bijepi vidhayak prahlada lodhi ne hoicourt main apil kii he
 On the other hand, the Chief Electoral Officer of Madhya Pradesh has sent a notice to cancel the membership of Lodhi to the Central Election Commission
 prahlada lodhi samet 12 logon par aarope tha ki unhone ret khanan ke khilaaf karrwai karne vaale rapura tehseeldaar ko bich sadak par rokkar marpet kii thi
 The state BJP suffered a delay of two days in this case, according to sources, the high command is also angry with this, after which the top leaders of the state met the Governor today
 madhyapradesh vidhansabha adhyaksh enpi prajapati ne kaha is sambandh main certifii copy mere saamne rakhi gai, jisko baad mere dwaara aadesh jari ho gai tatsambandhi jaankaree rajptr main chhapane ke liye evam chunaav ayog ko suchit kar diya gaya he ki vidhansabha main ek pad rikt ho gaya he
 At the same time, BJP leader Prahlad Lodhi said in this case, it has not happened till date when the court has given me time till December 12, they should have given it too, they did it in 24 hours immediately
 unhone ye sochaa bijepi ke vidhayak kam ho jaaen hamaare badhenge
 By the way, according to mathematics, Netaji made the correct decision, because the Madhya Pradesh Assembly has 230 members
 prahlada lodhi kii vidhayaki khatm hone se sadsy sankhya 229 ho gai yani philhal apane 115 vidhayakon ke saath congress ko purna bahumat he, use 4 nirdaleey, 2 basapa , 1 sapa ke vidhayak kaa bhi samarthan he
 BJP now has 107 mlas in the House
 is maamle main court jane ke alaava purv vidhansabha adhyaksh sitasharan sharma sahit bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ne rajyapal kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 After the meeting with the Governor, Sitasharan Sharma said, "we have told the Governor the legal position, it has been told that the order of the Speaker is non-constitutional
 i am firmly saying that in 192 this provision is written, who disqualifies
 
 
 yaa to sadan karata he yaa governor
 It is very clear
 rajyapal ne kaha he wo ise dekhenge
 In this case, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly is the guardian of mlas, it is not the decision of the guardian, it has been decided in a hurry with political malice to give political benefit to a particular party which cannot be called fair
 vahiin cabinet mantri jitu patawaari ne kaha bijepi jab jab sarkaar ko asthir karne kii baat karenge vot kaa apmaan hoga bijepi ke vidhayak dukhi hokar sarkaar kaa samarthan karenge
 The matter is now in the court of the High Court, if the postponement of the sentence is granted, Prahlada Lodhi's membership will remain intact, experts are also saying that after taking the opinion of the Election Commission under Article 192, only the Governor can take a final decision on termination of membership Not the president
 vaise prahlada lodhi par faisla guruuvar ko aayaa or vidhansabha ne do dinon baad vidhayaki radd kii
 Now questions are arising within the BJP that ignoring the rules is one thing, but why the officials of the organization have remained relaxed for two days, according to sources, the state BJP organization has been awakened after the displeasure of the central leadership from Delhi in this matter
 bisisiai ke kuch sadasyon ne ipel saat ke maamalon ke sanchaalan ke liye en shrinivasana kii jagah sunil gavaskar ko antarim adhyaksh banane ke supreme court ke faisle ko dekhte hue sthiti kaa jayja lene ke liye board kii aam sabha kii vishesh baithak bulaane kii maang kii he
 a top official of the BCCI recognized unit said, "yes, some of us have called for a special meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the events that have happened in the past
" court ke gavaskar ke naam kaa suzav dene ke turant baad maine bisisiai ko patr likhaa tha
 He said that but i am not sure whether the meeting can be called or not because the matter is in court
 aam raajnneetik samaj yahi kahati he ki dilli main aam aadmi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke samarthan dene ke peeche koi tuk nahin he
 Ultimately, the AAP won the victory in Delhi Assembly elections on the basis of anti-congress and anti-corruption issues
 joint killer kejariwal ne to dilli kii purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko unke ghar main dhul chataayee
 After all this, Kejriwal would never have expected that the Congress would give him unconditional support to form the government
 aakhir congress itani udaar kyon ho gai? yah us aatmachintan kaa nateeja to nahin jiskaa zikr rahul gandhi ne vidhansabha chunaavon main mili haar ke baad kiya tha yaa phir iske peeche bhi he koi siyaasi chaal? aisa lagata he ki rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepi ke haathon mili karaari haar ke baad congress netaaon ne party kaa bhavishya dekh liya he
 They have come to realize that the party's defeat in 2014 is certain
 koshish yahi he ki mukhya virdohi narendra modi kii jeet ke daayre ko kam kiya jaae, or isi vajah se congress aam aadmi party ko badhaava de rahi he
 The hope is that Kejriwal, who left a mark in the voters' heart on the anti-corruption issue, will be able to dent bjp's vote share, especially in urban areas
 darasal, 2009 loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtra ke chunavi aankadon par najar daalen to pataa chal jaataa he ki aakhir congress kya hasil karnaa chaahati he
 Before the elections, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena Supremo Raj Thackeray was constantly threatening to leave North Indians to leave Mumbai and respect the Marathi manoos
 giraftaar kii baari maang ke baavjood congress-ensipi sarkaar ne raaj thakare ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii
 As a result, MNS activists got encouraged, they created a ruckus in Mumbai and surrounding areas
 kabhi dukaanon ko band karavaaya or to kabhi taxi chalaane vaale uttar bharatiyon par hamale kiye
 The congress-ncp government could have arrested Raj Thackeray, could have easily stopped the violence so that the MNS workers get a strong message
 lekin, sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar raaj thakare ko marathi maanush kaa champion banane diya
 The police did not take any action against Raj Thackeray until the court intervened
 lekin tab tak emenes supremeo media main hui is publicity ke jariye marathi matadaataaon tak apni baat pahunchaa chuke the
 In the subsequent Lok Sabha elections, MNS made a tremendous dent in Shiv Sena stronghold
 shahari ilaakon main party par badi sankhya main marathi votaron ne bharosa dikhaaya
 The result was that the bjp-shiv Sena alliance lost 10 out of 11 seats on which the MNS had fielded its candidate
 mumbai, thane, nasik, bhiwandi or pune kii 6 siton par to congress-ensipi gathbandhan ke ummidavaaron ke jeet kaa antar emenes ummdeevaar ko mili vot se kam tha
 Fantasyly, if the MNS had not contested the election, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance would have won 10 more seats

 Had the MNS candidates not performed well, the bjp-shiv Sena would have got 30 seats and the congress-ncp would have got only 15 seats, which would have changed the political equation of the state
 apane mukhya virdohi ke vot share main send lagane ke liye ek or virdohi ko aage badhaane kii ranneeti behad hi kutil or khatarnaak hoti he
 This political move has been part of the Congress strategy
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki kya congress aam aadmi party ke kandhe par bandook rakhkar modi kaa shikaar kar sakegi? iske bare main india today group ne desh ke jane-maane chunaav vishleshkon se baat kii
 Yashwant Deshmukh, Chief Editor of Sea Voter, said, 'aam Aadmi Party is a middle class phenomenon and the middle class no longer settles only in cities
 lagbhag 200 siton par middle class kaa bada share he
 Suddenly the fight on these seats has become fun
 agar puure desh main AAP kaa vot share 5 fisadi rahaa to wo bijepi ko 50 siton par nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 If they get 10 per cent vote share, then BJP will get a shock on 100 seats, and there may be a close fight between BJP and Congress in these seats
 lekin aam aadmi party ne 15 fisadi vot share hasil kar liye to in siton par party kii jeetne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he, jaisaa dilli main hua
 At the same time, Professor Sanjay Kumar, associated with CSDS, said, "arvind Kejriwal has emerged as an attractive option compared to Modi in urban areas
 AAP nishchit taur par modi kii lokapriyata main sendhamari karegi lekin iskaa asar shahari kshetron main padane vaale voton main hoga na ki bijepi ke seat share main
 Due to AAP, BJP can lose 5 to 7 seats in Lok Sabha, not more than that
 'oxs investment ke chairman surajeet bhalla kehete hai, 'agar AAP kaa vot share dilli chunaavon main mili vot ke anupaat main rahaa to wo bijepi se zyada congress ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 i estimate that the AAP would win 7 seats in 300 urban parliamentary constituencies, which would probably go to the BJP account
 'narendra modi or bijepi haikaman shahari pocket main uske vot share main AAP dwaara sendhamari lagaae jane kii sambhaavna ko lekar kaaphi chintit he
 In every meeting in this regard, the leaders of the party are fiercely attacking Kejriwal Factor
 haalanki, saarvajanik taur par ve aam aadmi party kii chunauti ko darkinar karte hai
 GVL Narasimha Rao, election analyst and member of the bjp's National Election Management Committee, told India Today Group, 'the Congress successfully used the vote-cut strategy in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh in the 2009 elections
 lekin iske baad yah ranneeti punjab main manpreet badal kii pipipi or gujarat main keshubhai patel ke saath flop rahi
 This time the message has gone that the Aam Aadmi Party is with the Congress
 isliye AAP rashtriya paridrishy main congress virdohi voton kaa phayda nahin uthaa sakegi
 Now AAP is also a part of the system, so now they are not a big challenge for BJP outside Delhi
 agar aane vaale kuch maheenon main dilli kii sarkaar acha kaam nahin karti to log niraash ho jaaenge
 After this, he will not be a challenge for Modi even in Delhi
 'haalanki congress us puri theory ko khaarij kar rahi he jiske mutabik modi ko maat dene ke liye party arvind kejariwal kaa saath de rahi he
 Information Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said, 'the Congress supported the AAP so that elections are not once again imposed on the people of Delhi
 haalanki yah avadharana ki kisi ek shaks ko rashtriya chunaav main maat dene ke liye hamane ye siyaasi chaal chali, bilkul galat he
 The Congress has the ability to fight its own battles without helping others
 'aam aadmi party bhi in aaropon ko khaarij kar rahi he ki unke or congress ke bich match fiks he
 AAP senior leader and well-known election analyst Yogendra Yadav told India Today Group, 'this is the drawing room theory of a Congress leader from South Delhi, with no truth at all
 congress hi kya or aam aadmi party ko bhi ye nahin pataa ki aane vaale samay main ye nai party kiske vot kaategi
 Without any proof, this theory is nothing more than a fun political googly
 'chunavi itihaas gavaah he ki jab bhi congress ne kisi rajya main najdiki phaayde ke liye ek kshetreey party ko tavajjo di he, iskaa nuksaan hameshaa hi party ko hua he
 The Congress, which has been crippled by corruption charges, has joined hands with its adversary this time, but it may be that the party does not create a bogey in the meantime that poses a threat to it
 pakistan ke itihaas main aisa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua sirf chaar din adaalat baithi or chauthe hi din adaalat ne chah saal kii maasoom jainab ke guhagaar ko faansee kii sazaa suna di
 This is the record for the fastest execution in Pakistan
 aapako bataa den ki pichley maheene paanch janvari ko lahore ke najadik chah saal kii jainab ghar ke paas se gum ho gai thi
 Later, his body was found on a pile of garbage
 jainab kaa apharan karne ke baad uske saath balaatkaar kiya gaya or phir use maar diya gaya
 This accident gave a panic to the whole of Pakistan, just like the Nirbhaya incident rocked the whole of India six years ago

 Still it has been six years but Nirbhaya's culprits still have not reached their end
 jabaki pakistan main chah saal kii maasoom jainab ke gunahagaar ko faqat chaar din main faansee par latakaane kaa faisla aa gaya
 Yes, the death of Zainab, whose death had brought the whole of Pakistan to a boil, the death sentence of the same Zainab is sentenced by the Special Court of Pakistan

 56 witnesses, 4 days and then the Faisalpakistani police filed a charge sheet against the accused Imran Ali in Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore on 13 February in the court of ATC Judge Sajjad Hussain
 iske baad adaalat main jainab ke bhai or chachaa samet kul 56 gavaahon ke bayaan darj hue
 Reported for forensic report and polygraphy test
 tamaam gavaahon or sabooton ke maddenjar adaalat imran ali ko jainab ke apharan, rape, hatya or uske saath aprakritik ghatana ko anjaam dene kaa doshi mana
 Justice Sajjad Hussain sentenced Imran to death in 4 cases concurrently, while delivering the verdict on February 17, just the fourth day of the execution of the death sentence in 4 cases
 inamen jainab kaa apharan, rape, murder or phir laash ke saath usne jo suluk kiya wo bhi shaamil tha

 iske baad khud imran ke vakil ne pairvi karne se hi inkaar kar diya
 Demand to hang the convict publicly, now Imran has 15 days to appeal in the High Court
 haalanki khabar aa rahi he ki jurm kabool karne ke baad ab wo faansee ke faisle ko hai court main chunauti nahin degaa
 If this happens, he will be hanged within the next few days
 adaalat ke is tej faisle par jainab ke gharavaalon ne bhi santosh jataayaa he
 But Zainab's father demands that Zainab's culprit should not be hanged publicly but inside the jail
 taaki imran jaise baaki log isse naseehat le saken

 Reid Collins, Chief Creative Officer, Ogilvy & Mather Group, Hong Kong, who started the campaign says, “this is a unique campaign of its kind
 
 
 isamen nayaapan he
 
 
 This will make people connect
 
 
 yah hamaara khud kaa vaigyanik prayog he, jise ham somaajik badlaav laane ke liye istemaal kar rahe hai
 
 
 Garbage is a very big problem in Hong Kong, and thanks to technology we are now able to show the face of garbage mongers by avoiding the sight of everyone, and force people to think twice before spreading garbage
 
 
 " So, if you are going to Hong Kong, or are planning to leave in the near future, then make sure that you do not spread garbage at all
 
 
 tippaniyan However, in this video below, let's see how this campaign and scientific process works
 
 
 sadakon par failaa kachra hamaare hi desh kii nahin, bahut-se deshon kii sabase badi samasyaon main se ek he, lekin isse nipatane or isaki rokthaam karne ke raste main sabase badi rukaawat yah he ki aamtaur par log baaki sabhi kii nazaren bachaakar kachra phenk jate hai, or unhen maukey par nahin pakadaa ja paata
 
 
 But now on the road, chewing wrappers and those throwing empty packets of chips should be careful, because maybe a big poster with your big picture in a corner of the city in a while Be seen 
 
 is poster main bhale hi aapkaa naam nahin hoga, lekin aapkaa cheharaa to 'kachra failaane vaala' ke rup main 'mashhoor' ho hi jayega
 
 
 But at present the idea is not adopted in India, but in Hong Kong, where a campaign titled 'the Face of Litter' has been launched, to combat the 'epidemic' of litter Science is being resorted to
 
 
 is anuthe safai jaagrukta abhiyaan ke tahat kachra failaane waalon ko dand yaa jurmaane kii chetavanee dene ke sthaan par diene phenotyping (DNA phenotyping) kii madad se kachra failaane vaale kii tasviir banaai jaaegi, or shahar-bhar main chipka di jaaegi
 
 
 The campaign launched on the occasion of Earth Day will focus on areas of Hong Kong where garbage is the biggest problem
 
 
 abhiyaan ke liye kaam kar rahe log dastaane pahanakar kachra uthaaenge, or prayogshaala main pahunchaayenge, jahaan techniciyanon kii team kachare par se diene data ekatra kar kachra phenkane vaale kii tasviir bana daalenge
 
 
 After this, the pictures of these people will be pasted across the city, they will be made online, so that not only the garbage spreaders are ashamed, but also those who throw garbage will get a lesson
 
 
 is abhiyaan ko shuru karne vaale ogilvi and methar group, honkong ke chif creative officer read colins kaa kahana he, "yah apni tarah kaa anoothaa abhiyaan he
 
 
 There is newness in it
 
 
 isse logon kaa judaav hoga
 
 
 This is our own scientific experiment, which we are using to bring about social change
 
 
 kachra honkong kii behad badi samasya he, or takanic kii badaulat ab ham sakasham hai ki sabaki nazaron se bache rahakar kachra failaane waalon kaa cheharaa zaahir kar saken, or logon ko kachra failaane se pehle do baar sochane ke liye majaboor kar saken
 
 
 " so, agar aap honkong ja rahe hai, yaa nikat bhavishya main jane kaa kaarykram bana rahe hai to is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki aapako kachra katai nahin failaana he
 
 
 The comments baharhaal, neeche die is video main dekhte hai, yah abhiyaan or vaigyanik prakriya kaise kaam karti he

 isisi world cap-2019 main team india ko england se mili karaari shikast ke baad kai khilaadiyon ke pradarshan par sawaal uthne lage hai
 Team India may have had an unbeatable campaign before this match, but the performance of many players of the winning combination has been poor so far
 ab aage ke mukaable pressure vaale honge, aise main coach or captain dwaara tay kiye jane vaale plaing-11 par sabaki najar hogi
 KL Rahul vs Dinesh Karthikashkhar Dhawan After the injury, KL Rahul was tried as an opener
 rahul bataur openar kuch khaas nahin kar paae
 He scored 34 from 6 matches
 40 kii ausat se 172 ran banaae hai
 His strike rate of 69
 07 he
 This includes just a half-century
 saath hi jis akramak ballebaaji ke liye rahul jane jate hai, vah andaaj bhi unka nahin dikhaa
 He has not been able to progress his innings even after playing dot ball continuously
 rahul ke vikalp ke taur par team main rishabh pant or dinesh karthik hi rah gaye hai
 However, Dinesh Karthik has not been able to do anything special as an opener, but he knows to play under pressure
 karthik 91 vanade match main 17 baar opening kar chuke hai
 His best innings in this was against West Indies (67 runs)
 karthik ne pichley saal (18 march, 2018) nidahaas trophy main karishmai ballebaaji karte hue cricket kii duniya main dhooma machaa di thi
 R
 of Colombo premdasa stadium main karthik ke balle se 8 gendon main 29* (6, 4, 6, 0, 2, 4, 1, 6) ranon kii barish ne bangladesh kii jeet kii ummiido par pani pher diya tha
 At the same time, Rishabh Pant has impressed in the IPL, but the pressure of the World Cup will be different
 igland ke khilaaf world cap debyue match main unki ballebaaji main gambhirtha nahin dikh rahi thi
 Kedar Jadhav has also been a flop show in the Kedar Jadhav vs Ravindra Jadejais World Cup, but he remains a part of the team in the affair of the winning combination
 kedaar ne is world cap main 6 match khele hai or 80 ran banaae hai
 It includes a half-century
 saath hi captain kohli unase gendbaaji bhi abhi tak nahin kara paae hai
 At the same time, Ravindra Jadeja is proving to be a game changer for the team as a Substitute Fielder
 australia ke khilaaf unhone maxwell kaa kaich liya tha, jo team india kii jeet main ahm sabit hua
 Similarly, he was out of the team against England, but while fielding, he took 2 catches
 isamen ek kaich jesan roy kaa tha, jise unhone boundry ke paas dive lagaate hue pakadaa
 Due to his catch, the England team could not reach beyond 350, because no Indian bowler could stop the rhythm in which Roy was playing
 is world cap main in 2 kaichon ke saath hi sabstitute ke taur par khelte hue jadeja ke naam 4 kaich ho gaye hai
 Jadeja is also heavier than Kedar because he saves a lot of runs from his fielding
 saath hi ek phul gendbaaj kii bhi puri bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In such a situation, now in his next two matches, Kohli takes the field with which team and combination, now everyone's eye is on it

 com / 4rcs67json— ANI (@ani)july 3, 2019 The Congress on Friday defended Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda's statement that marriage was inappropriate in a gotra as the controversy over Khap panchayats over consanguineous marriages continued
 congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘mukhyamantri ne samaaj ke sandarbh main yah baat kahi thi or unka aashay aisa bilkul bhi nahin tha, jaisaa kii kaha ja rahaa he
 Asked whether a Chief Minister can publicly express a private opinion on such matters, he said that anyone can have a personal opinion but the reference to the Chief Minister's statement was very different
 samgotra vivaah par congress ke ruukh ke bare main puche jane par congress pravaktaa ne kaha ‘is vishay main congress kaa rukh bilkul spasht he
 The party believes that it is not right to force violence on the subject
 ’ baharhaal, haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hudda ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki rajya kii puraani paramparaon ke anusaar ek gotra main shaadi karnaa galat he tathaa aaj bhi samaaj ise sweekaar nahin karata
 In an event at IMT Manesar, the Chief Minister said that it is not a matter of khap panchayats but the old tradition of Haryana state that marriages do not take place in any caste in any caste
 khap panchayaton dwaara mrityu dand dene ko hooda ne galat tathaa gaiyr kanoonee qaraar diya
 Earlier this year, Aj Namo was chosen as the first Tibetan fashion designer for Chinese Fashion Week, the country's largest fashion show
 lekin jab aayojakon ne unke liye modelon kii peshkash kii, jinamein kuch china kii namchin bhi thim, to unhone manaa kar diya
 He selected a small plains town in western Sichuan near Tibet and some young Tibetans from his hometown of Kangba
 yahi nahin, unhone chamakili roshni or tej sangeet ke saath paaramparik bhavy fishan sho ke udghaatan se bhi manaa kar diya, jise china ke log pasand karte hai
 Instead his elder sister Kelsung sang a Buddhist prayer
 32 varshiya aj namo kahati hai ki ''maine use gane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki tibeti samskruti main logon ko shanti or anand kaa anubhav karaane kii kshamta he
 Reciting the prayer helped, as it attracted the audience
 " jab 13 varsh pehle aj namo beijing gai thim, to vahaan keval sarkari chaatravrutti paane vaale tibeti chaatr yaa visthapit charvaahe hi the, jo shahar kii sadakon par hastshilp bechakar guzaara karte the
 There are about six million Tibetans in China, which is 1
 4 arab aabaadi (jinamein 90 fisadi se zyada haan chini hai) kaa maatr aadha fisadi he
 Aj Namo quickly gained prominence as a singer and came on television at a time when Chinese audiences began to pay attention to the art and culture of ethnic minority groups
 ab jabaki china ke kai tibetiyon main apni samskruti or pahchaan kii bhaavana ke kamjor padane kii chintaa he, ve bhi yuva tibetiyon main apni jadon ko phir se talashne kii vyapak tadap dekhati hai
 Young Tibetans, she says, have realized that many parts of their culture are missing and are trying to find them again
 sthapit gayika or ubhartee fishan diziner ke rup main aj namo khud ko beijing main tibeti samskruti ke doot ke rup main dekhati hai
 She wants to change Chinese perceptions of Tibetans and their culture, who consider them backward
 iske liye yah sahi samay bhi he, kyonki badi sankchaya main yuva haan chini ''khud kii talash" ke liye tibet kii yatra kar rahe hai or fishan wyk ke liye unka chayan hua he

 Then Akshay Kumar's debut film 'saugandh' was released in 1992
 'saughandh' ke liye bhi ravi shrivastav ne hi nirdeshak raaj sippi se akshay ke naam kii sifarish kii thi
 If you are a little upset with your wife, then hear Akshay Kumar giving some knowledge
 
 
 ravi shrivastav in dinon kidney kii samasya se peedit hai or unhen transplant ke liye paise kii sakht jarurat he
 Ravi Shrivastava's condition was mentioned on Twitter by a fan of Akshay Kumar
 saath hi is sambandh main ek lekh kaa link bhi diya
 Akshay replied on this - 'yes sir, my team has reached them
 pehle hi care kii ja chuki he
 ' congress kii duusari list main bhale hi do purv saansad mahabal mishra or ajay maakan kaa naam thodaa chaunkaane vaala ho kyonki dwarka vidhansabha se mahabal mishra chunaav ladenge jo loksabhaa kaa chunaav haar chuke hai
 Whereas, by giving Ajay Maken a ticket from the Sadar Assembly, the Congress has made it clear that Ajay Maken will be the captain of the Congress Delhi elections
 lekin, is list main sabase zyada chaunkaane vaala naam suresh kumaar kaa he
 Suresh Kumar joined the Congress two years ago
 ve dilli main bijepi ke varisht netaa jagadish mukhi ke damaad he
 Two years ago, when he did not get the councilor's ticket from the BJP, he joined the Congress by getting angry
 haalanki jagadish mukhi ne unhen tikat dilaane kii ji tod koshish kii thi
 The political ambition of Suresh Kumar is not hidden from anyone
 jab bijepi se tikat nahin mila to unhone nirdaleey chunaav ladane kii thaanee thi, lekin jagadish mukhi ke dabaav main apana namakan waapas le liya tha
 Now the Congress has made the contest interesting by making him its candidate from Janakpuri
 ab agar bijepi apane puraane ummidavaar yani jagadish mukhi ko tikat detii he to muqabla sasur or damaad ke bich hoga
 However, from this seat, Congress's own Sanjay Puri, son of senior leader Mukesh Sharma and relative of Mahabal Mishra also tried hard for the ticket
 janakapuri bijepi kii paramparaagat seat rahi he or is vidhansabha main bijepi ke teen parshad bhi hai
 Jagdish Mukhi has been an MLA five times 
 pichhali jagadish mukhi sirf 3000 voton se janakapuri kii seat se jeet paae the
 He had a tough fight with Aam Aadmi Party candidate Rajesh Rishi
 pehle aap party ke arvind kejariwal ne unke poster lagaakar kai baar survey karaae or apane ko unase upar dikhaaya
 Now the challenges facing his own son-in-law have definitely increased Mukhi's difficulties

 More than one lakh people are killed every year in road accidents in the country and in Uttar Pradesh this dreadful figure is around 15,000 annually
 duniya main sadak durghatnaon main sabase zyada mauton kaa saamana karne ke baavjood desh main jis tarah se aankh mundakar driving license jari kiye jate hai, usase shaq hota he ki ye driving license hai yaa maut kaa paravaanaa
 In the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh, 11,22,428 driving licenses were issued in the last financial year and in almost 90 percent of the cases, there was no confirmation whether the licensee knows how to drive a vehicle
 license or nateejajari license:11,22,428prati adhikari license:10,000bina jaanch ke jari:90%sadak durghatnaayen:21,985sadak durghatana main maut:14,829pradesh main driving license banane kaa jimmaa uthaane vaale riginal transport daftaron (artio) kaa haal yah he ki vahaan na to itani jagah he or na hi itnaa staff ki driveron kii niyamanusaar jaanch kii ja sake
 There is so much of files in offices that half the space is spent in keeping them
 iske alaava dallalon kii bharmaar or ugaahi kii vyastata aise kaam hai jinke chalate niyamon kaa paalan karaane kaa vakt hi nahin miltaa
 The condition of the RTO office in Ghaziabad, adjoining the capital Delhi, is that about 300 applications are received every day for getting driving license and about 150 of these people are issued licenses without having to drive
 gajiabad main har maheene kareeb 5,500 driving license jari hote hai
 These include 300 driving licenses for heavy vehicles such as trucks and 3,000 learning for small vehicles and 2,000 permanent licenses
 daftar main driving test lene ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Recently, when an inspector saw a driver driving a car in front of the license issuing window, he hit the car in front
 is ghatana main license khidki ke saamne kaa khambha hi ukhd gaya
 Vehicles are now parked on the 20-foot space in front of the window
 gajiabad ke artio lalji choudhary ne apane daftar ke haal ke bare main mana ki ''gajiabad main vaahan chalavakar dekhne kaa koi intjaam nahin he
 We are forced to issue a license without driving
 baari vaahanon ke bare main bhi yahi baat lagu hoti he
 He said that if his office complies with the Citizen's Charter, fewer licenses will be made, as according to the charter, only 20 to 22 licenses can be made in a day, whereas 150 licenses are normally made here
 unke mutabik license banavaane ke liye log itani badi sankhya main aate hai ki agar niyamon kaa sakhti se paalan hone lage to 90 fisadi log khaali haath lautenge
 This can make things worse
 choudhary ne gadiyon ke fitness praaanpatr jari karne main bhi niyamon kaa puri tarah paalan na ho paane kii baat sweekaar kii
 He said that for issuing the license, it is mandatory for the concerned person to come to the office and get photographed, so that the fake license is banned
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki bagaiyr test liye license jari hona bhi sadak durghatnaon kaa ek sabab he
 In fact, most offices in the state are similar to Ghaziabad
 noida main artio ke paas apni imaarat tak nahin he
 There was a proposal to get new land for office in Noida Extension but the matter there is pending in court
 gajiabad ke artio daftar main 1979 ke baad se ab tak kii 10 lakh se adhik filein rakhi hai or aadha se zyada daftar filon se pata he
 At the same time, outside the office, the brokers have put their bags, which are worth Rs 1,000 to get the license
 tak lete hai
 On the other hand, the condition of Agra, which leaves a mark on the tourism map of the whole world, is worse
 yahaan bhi sirf cheharaa dekhakar license jari kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no arrangement to get the vehicle seen
 yahaan ke artio karyaalay kii kaary pranali kii kalai pichley dinon tab khuli jab ek mahila eartio par ek trek clinar kii hatya kaa aarope laga
 It is alleged that ARTO paid Rs 50
 na dene par driver or clinar kii do police waalon se itani pitayee karwaai ki clinar kii maut ho gai
 The National Human Rights Commission has summoned a reply from the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh in this matter
 agra kaa artio daftar bhi har maheene kareeb 6,000 driving license jari karata he
 Despite the office staff fully coming to the surface, Agra RTO Vinod Kumar Sonkia was seen defending himself
 unhone kaha ki jahaan tak sambhav ho paata he, license jari karne main niyamon kaa paalan karavaaya jaataa he
 At the same time, outside Jhansi's RTO office, brokers have decorated shops
 yahaan bhi bina kisi test ke license jari ho rahe hai
 When the department cracked last year, a gang of RTO employees and brokers in Barabanki, Lakhimpur Kheri and Gonda districts were exposed for wrongly issuing licenses
 is sabake baavjood pradesh ke parivahan ayukta rajan shukla sarathi project se aas lagaae baithe hai
 The license issuance process is being completely computerized under this project started by the Central Government
 rashtriya soochna centre kaa taiyaar software aavedakon ke photo or donon haathon ke anguuthon ke nishaan darj karata he, taaki ek vyakti do license na banavaa sake
 "the Sarathi project is under review," says Shukla
 isse jilon main license banane kii gadabadiyaan dur kii ja sakengi
 "however, a senior officer of his office accepts the collusion of brokers and employees
" unka kahana he ki artio karyaalay or police adheekshak karyaalay main talmail kii kami he
 Due to this, brokers are unable to act immediately despite complaining
 ab jaraa puure pradesh ke sadak parivahan mahakme ke haal par najar daalen
 The number of people driving license here is increasing by an average of 10 per cent annually
 2009-10 main jahaan 10,32,221 license bane vahiin 2010-11 main yah sankhya 11,22,428 tak pahunch gai
 The responsibility of making the license belongs to the RTO or ARTO, but this work has been entrusted to the inspectors in the state
 vidambnaa yah ki pradesh main mahaj 117 inspector hai, yani ek inspector saal bhar main 10,000 se zyada license jari kar rahaa he
 This fraud in issuing licenses was also revealed in surveys of the Institute for Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) in Delhi
 santhaan ke senior faillo es
 P
 singh ne bataaya, ''santhaan ne 2007 main 1,000 trek driveron par kiye surveykshan main paaya ki 50 fisadi driveron ke paas ek se adhik driving license the
 In a similar survey conducted in 1997, the number was 40 per cent
 '' unhone kaha ki jis tarah se license jari kiye ja rahe hai, usase ye kaagaj ke tukade zyada ahmiyat nahin rakhte or sadak durghatnaon kaa bada kaaran hai
 The latest report of the World Health Organization 'decade of Action on Road Safety 2011 to 2020' is a reflection of how dangerous these pieces of paper are making the country's roads
 report ke mutabik bharat main har saal ausatan 1,05,000 log sadak durghatnaon main marate hai or durghatana mrityu kii suchi main bharat china ko pachhadkar sabase upar aa gaya he
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, in 2009, 1,21,626 people died in 4,21,628 road accidents in the country, while in Uttar Pradesh, the figure is 14,829 deaths in 21,985 accidents
 bharat main sadak durghatana kaa shikaar hone vaale 67
 5 percent of the people do not survive
 agar kuch raahat najar aati he to vah he gujarat or haryana rajyon se, jahaan driver training kii sahi vyavastha ko amal main laayaa ja chukaa he
 Apart from these states, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have also succeeded to some extent in making the license issuance process IT enabled
 magar jahaan tak uttar pradesh or baaki rajyon kaa sawaal he to license ram bharose hi jari ho rahe hai
 And maybe that's why people keep the license or not, God definitely keep on the dash board of the car

 Let us tell you that NDTV had shown the news a few days ago about irregularities in loan waiver
 hamanen dikhaaya tha ki kis tarah se sarkaar (MP Government) ke tamaam vaadon ke baad bhi kisaanon (jai Kisan Loan Scheme) kaa puraa karj maaf nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Alam is that some farmers (jai Kisan Loan Scheme) have got loan waiver of just Rs 200 and some have had to be satisfied with just Rs 13
 sarkaar (MP Government) dwaara rin maafi kii prakashit suchi par kisaan aapatti jataa rahe the
 Only after this news was shown, the government (MP Government) decided to set up a control room at the district level to address complaints related to debt waiver
 is khabar ke baad mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kisaanon kii shikayaton or rini kisaanon kii aapattiyon ko gambhirtha se liya he
 Please tell that by registering complaints in this control room, within two days maximum of the facts have been confirmed or investigated and the complainant has been informed
 enditivi ne apni khabar main yah bhi dikhaaya tha ki kis tarah khargun, agar-malwa, chhindwara jaise kai zilon main karjamaafee ko lekar kisaan khud ko thaga mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Significantly, in Madhya Pradesh, under the Jai Kisan Debt Mukti Yojana, farmers had complained about debt waiver
 kisaanon kaa kahana tha kisarkaari daftaron main chipkaai ja rahi he suchi sahi nahin he
 If there is a loan waiver of 30 rupees in front of someone's name, then one hundred and fifty rupees
 sabase badi dikkat sarkari bainkon main he jahaan par ye list angreji main aa rahi he
 The farmers said that studying in English is not a matter of anyone and in such a situation no one is able to know whose name is there or not

 The decision received a lot of accolades from the Congress, but there is a lot of confusion among the farmers about it from the beginning
 haalat yah he ki kisaanon ab bhatak rahe hai

 lekin is form ko bharne ke baad khargun ke kisaan bhi hairaan the,kai ke naam 25, 50, 150, 180 or 300 rupee tak darj hai
 Farmer Ratan Lal Mahajan said that he had not taken any loan for 2 years, but still Rs 180 in front of his name
 karjamaafee likhaa he
 Hameed Khan, who belongs to Chief Minister Kamal Nath's area of chhindwara, has a debt of Rs 10,000 but has waived only Rs 232

 When we contacted Kamal Faruqi on behalf of the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board, he said that he would not say anything about it right now, because the atmosphere in the country is bad
 aise main court main sunwaayee aage bade tabhi unka bolnaa uchit hoga
 It is not appropriate to speak anything in this regard, which is peace and brotherhood in the country
 philhal puure desh or duniya kii nigahen supreme court par tiki hai ki sunwaayee kii disha or ruparekha kis tarah aage badhati he
 Explain that 9,000-page documents and 90,000-page witnesses related to this case are recorded in various languages including Pali, Persian, Sanskrit, Arabic, on which the Sunni Waqf Board had asked the court to translate these documents
