 The report said that if the contractor company does not complete the work within the time limit after getting the six-lane contract, the toll tax collected by them during this delay should be deposited in a 'pending amount' account
 yah paisa tab tak thekedaar ko nahin milanaa chahie, jab tak vah pehla mil stone puraa nahin kar letaa or aglaa mil stone sahi samay par puraa nahin kar letaa
 As long as the interest in the amount will remain in the account, there is a rule to give interest to NHAI

 Nobel Prize-awarded international economist Paul Krugman has said that he was very surprised by the Narendra Modi government's decision on demonetisation in India
 krugaman kaa kahana he ki notebandi jaise kadam se kaledhan or bhrashtachar par lagaam nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he

 unki daleel he ki bharat duniya main sabase adhik kaamkaaji jansankhya vaala desh he lihaaja itani kam vikaas dar ko kisi haalat main uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 According to Krugman, under these circumstances, India's growth rate should have been 8 to 9 percent
 haalanki krugaman kaa kahana he ki unhenmodi sarkaarake notebandi faisle ke baad jitne bade nuksaan kii ummid thi utana dekhne ko nahin mila
 But it is certain that the advice given to the government to take note ban was wrong

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh desh main 52 hajaar jagahon par alag-alag prakaar kii dainik, saptahik, masik gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan karata he
 The number of daily meetings has increased by 3,000 in the last one year
 sangh kaa daawa he ki dainik gatividhiyon main hissaa lene waalon main 75 fisadi log 45 saal se kam aayu ke the
 But despite this, the Sangh is finding itself at a crossroads with relations with its political organization BJP
 bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko doosraa kaarykaal dene ko lekar sangh main uhapoh jarur he, lekin vah iskaa phayda party main gadakari virodhiyon ko dene ke mood main katai nahin he
 After the meeting of All India Executive Board held in Chennai last week (2-4 November), the Sangh is seen giving this message
 sangh pramukh mohan madhukar raav bhagwat sangh kii chhavi ko bijepi se jodakar dekhte hai, kyonki yah parivaar kaa ekmaatr rajnatik cheharaa he
 Therefore, when he took charge of the Sangh, the leaders sitting in Delhi were first called 'D-4' and excluded from the race for the presidency
 itnaa hi nahin, bhagwat ne party main junior or rashtriya chhavi nahin rakhane vaale maharashtra ke tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh gadakari ko dilli bhejkar saaf sandesh diya tha ki netaa nahin, sanghathan bada he
 But with the ongoing campaign within the party over not giving Gadkari a second term, the Sangh fears that the removal of the current president may lead to LK Advani himself in the event of the Delhi sitting leader or any other name not being agreed upon
 While the Sangh is not in any mood to hand over the reins of the party to its command and decided its strategy with the decision of the BJP core group meeting on 6 November Is forced to express b
 gadakari ke swami vivekanand or daaud ibrahim kii ikyuu kii tulana vaale vivaadaaspad bayaan or unki company purti par lag rahe bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke baad ram jethmalani sareekhe netaaon ne saarvajanik taur se morcha khol diya, to aisa maahaul banaaya gaya ki gadakari istipha dene ko baadhya ho jaaen
 But according to sources, Gadkari apologized for the first statement on the instructions of Sangh chief Bhagwat
 iske baad bhagwat ne loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj, rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali or purv party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko phone kar chetavanee di
 The effect of this rebuke also showed and a joint statement was issued with the signature of sushma-jaitley in defense of Gadkari
 sangh ne dakhal dekar party ke bheetar chal rahe vivaad ko fori taur par thaamne kii koshish kii he, lekin chennai kii anaupchaarik baithak main sangh netaaon kaa asamanjas barkaraar rahaa
 However, the Sangh believes that troubled by corruption charges, the Congress has conspired and targeted Gadkari
 lekin iskaa rajnatik phayda kshetreey partiyon ko milegaa
 a senior Sangh leader says of Bhagwat's plan that Gadkari is likely to be given a second term, but if there is a problem, instead of the leaders sitting in Delhi, someone like Sangh Gadkari can bring a trump card
 chennai baithak ke baad sangh ke sarkarywah suresh joshi urf bhaiyaji ne gadakari kii company par lage aniyamittaaon ke aarope par spasht taur par kaha, ‘‘mahaj aaropon ke aadhaar par ham kaise kah sakate hai ki ve (gadakari) galat hai
 Neutral investigation is needed
 ’’ haalanki chennai main baithak se thik pehle 31 aktubar or phir 5 november ko sangh ke kareeb darjanabhar varisht netaaon ne bijepi main machi halchal par gahan vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 According to sources, the Sangh decided that if no legal obstruction or lawsuit was filed against Gadkari or finger pointing in the report of a government agency, he should be given a second term
 lekin usne is bare main abhi antim faisla nahin liya he
 After Deepawali, Bhaiyyaji Joshi will move to Delhi on November 19-20 and brainstorm on this subject with senior BJP leaders

 The 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign started on Thursday through a rally in Gurdaspur, Punjab

 Whereas no party has yet blown the election bugle from the opposition parties
 is tarah se is saal kii sabase badi siyaasi ladaai main bijepi badhat banaati hui najar aa rahi he
 Prior to the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections, PM Modi has focused on holding rallies in 123 Lok Sabha seats in 20 states, which the BJP could not win despite the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 aise main ab piem ne sarkari kaaryakramon or jansabhaon ke jariye in siton ke matadaataaon tak pahunchane kii ranneeti banaai he
 The BJP lost power in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in the recently held assembly elections
 in teenon rajyon main kul 65 sansadeey siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 62 of these seats were won
 aise main 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav main pichley nateezon ko doharaana party ke ek badi chunauti he
 If the results of the assembly elections are converted into Lok Sabha elections, then the BJP may reduce by about 28 to 30 seats
 aise main modi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke elaan se pehle hi apane kile ko durust karnaa shuru kar diya he
 For this, he has focused first on the 123 seats lost in the last election
 iske peeche bijepi kii ek ranneeti or bhi he ki in siton par apana saansad na hone ke kaaran sthaneey str par satta virdohi rujhaan kaa khatra bhi kam he
 In such a situation, there is a strategy to use lotus of Modi's face in these seats to feed lotus in the elections

 More than 4000 BJP workers had the responsibility of meeting one lakh people and telling them the achievements of the government

 At the same time, opposition parties like SP, BSP, NCP, TMC including Congress have not yet entered the electoral battle
 itnaa hi nahin vipaksh modi ke khilaaf ekta kii baat kar rahaa he, lekin abhi tak bihar or maharashtra ko chhodkar baaki rajyon kii gathbandhan kii tasviir saaf nahin ho saki he
 With the recent victory of three states by the Congress, people are beginning to see possibilities, but when will Rahul Gandhi enter the political battle
 ise lekar abhi tak koi ghoshnaa party kii ore se nahin kii gai he
 The Congress is yet to see him surrounded by Modi on any other issue except the Rafale deal
 jabaki bijepi ne paanch rajyon ke chunaav ke dauraan hi piem modi kii reliyon kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya tha
 Regarding bjp's Lok Sabha election preparations, SP mentor Mulayam Singh had to say that SP is still lagging behind in preparations

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator Planting more and more trees and not damaging any tree has been an unbreakable part of our country's glorious tradition
 dharamshastron main kuch pedo ke kaatane kii saaf manaahi he
 Peepal is at the top of such trees
 pipal ko na kaatane ke peeche kai tarah kii manyataayen hai
 These things have been discussed here
 
 
 1
 It is believed that Peepal has got the blessing of Vishnu that whoever worships Peepal on Saturday will be blessed by Lakshmi
 iske ulat, pipal ko kaatane vaale ke ghar kii sukh-samruddhi nasht hone kii ashanka rahati he
 This prevents people from cutting peepal
 2
 Even in the scriptures, Peepal has been considered useful in every way
 iske dharmik mahatva ko aadhaar banaakar ise na kaatane kaa niyam he
 3
 zyada se zyada oxigen chhodkar paryaavaran ko laabh pahunchane main pipal kaa shaayad hi koi jod ho
 Keeping in mind this importance of Peepal, it was forbidden to cut it in the scriptures
 4
 It is believed that the worship of Peepal brings blessings of Shani Dev
 iske anusaar, agar koi pipal ke vriksh ko nuksaan pahunchaata he, to use shani kaa coup jhelana pad saktaa he
 5
 shastron main to yahaan tak kaha gaya he ki agar koi pipal ko katate hue dekhtaa bhi he, to use bhi shanidosh lagata he
 For this, the law of peepal worship and donation etc
 has been told
 darasal, shastron kii rachana karne waalon ne is tarah ke niyam banaae, jisase manushya ke saath-saath paryaavaran or puri prithvi ko laabh ho
 In such a situation, it is quite natural to refuse the cutting of trees like peepal

 In the wake of Lok Sabha Election 2019, the Rashtriya Lok Dal's desire to get the desired seat from the SP-BSP alliance in the politics of UP has died
 ant-ant tak manachaaha seat paane kii ichha rakhane vaali areldi ko aakhirkaar sapa-basapa gathbandhan main mahaj teen siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal wanted four to five seats from the BSP-SP alliance in the Lok Sabha elections, but in the alliance of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav, this wish could not be fulfilled and now it can field its candidates in only three seats
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar sapa-basapa (SP-BSP Alliance) ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa hone ke baad areldi ko teen siten milin, vahiin sapa 37 or basapa 38 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Rashtriya Lok Dal has got the seats of Mathura, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat in western UP, from where three RLD candidates can try their seats
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki mujffarnagar se ajit singh or bagpat se jayant choudhary chunaav lard sakate hai
 However, there is no indication of who will be RLD candidate from Mathura so far
 sapa or basapa ke gathbandhan main shuru se hi areldi kii yah koshish rahi kii kam se kam use paanch siten mili
 Initially the RLD had demanded 5 seats from the SP-BSP alliance, while the SP-BSP alliance was ready to give three seats to the RLD right from the beginning
 areldi ne in paanch siton kii maang kii thi- hathras, kairana, bagpat, muzaffarnagar or kairana
 However, he had to settle for only three seats
 mangalvaar ko akhilesh yadav ne sahyogi party areldi ko lekar bhi tippanee kii
 He said that we are giving three seats to RLD in this election
 is elaan ke baad areldi ke netaa jayant choudhary ne kaha ki RLD uttar pradesh main teen loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladegi
 He said that the RLD would join the BSP-SP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 hamaare kaaryakarta athak parishram karenge, taaki rajya kii har seat par gathbandhan kii jeet sunishchit ho sake
 There was also discussion in political circles that initially Akhilesh Yadav was ready to give some more seats to RLD from his quota, but Mayawati was adamant on her decision
 jab aisi hawa chali ki areldi sapa-basapa gathbandhan main manmutabik seat nahin milane par alag ho sakati he to akhilesh yadav ne apane cote se kuch siten dene kii bhi baat kahi
 But then later it became clear that none of the SP and BSP would give more than three seats to the RLD
 lekin teen-paanch ke is siyaasi khel main aakhirkaar jayant singh or ajit singh baaji nahin jeet paae or unhen basapa-sapa gathbandhan main mahaj teen siton par hi santosh karnaa padaa
 However, for four to five seats the RLD tried everything possible
 iske liye akhilesh yadav se kai baar jayant singh ne baatcheet bhi kii
 But there was no success of any kind
 bataa den ki mayawati kii party basapa or akhilesh yadav kii party sapa baraabar-baraabar siton par apane ummidavaar utaaregi

 Minister of State Ravindra Vaikar while speaking to NDTV India objected that, the Cabinet Minister of my department, who is the CM himself, does not give me work
 jo adhikaar hai, use bhi kam karne kii koshish ho rahi he
 This is not right
 is babat maine mukhyamantri ko khat likhaa he
 If this is going on then what is the point of staying in office rajasav rajyamantri sanjay rathod ne sahyogi rajyamantri vaayakar ke sur main sur milaayaa he
 Rathod also met Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray regarding his resignation
 lekin, unhen thame rahane ko kaha gaya
 Shiv Sena has a total of 10 ministers in the Maharashtra government, of which five are ministers of state
 jabaki bijepi ke paanch rajyamantri shivasena ke cabinet mantriyon ke matahat kaam kar rahe hai
 Holding the same thread, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told reporters that no BJP minister of state had ever complained against the senior minister of the Sena
 rajyamantrion ko kya kaam diya jaae, yah kanoon main vidit he or usee lihaaz se kaam kaa bantwaaraa hua he
 One may feel that he is capable of doing more work
 lekin aisa karne ke liye kanoon main sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 Minister of State for Revenue Eknath Khadse appears to have retaliated by replying to the allegations against him, despite the mood to resolve the Chief Minister's case through negotiations
 khadse ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha he ki, rajyamantriyon ko vishisht kaam ke liye aagrah nahin karnaa chahie
 After this rhetoric, this dispute between the bjp-shiv Sena government of Maharashtra is not taking its name

 PM Modi to give victory mantra to bjp's 1 crore booth workers from 15000 places aisa kyon he ki doordarshan kaa naam hameshaa galat kaarnon se hi saamne aata he? desh kaa pramukh tivi news prasarankarta doordarshan lagaataar apni jagah khota ja rahaa he
 But there was never any effort to re-establish it in its old place
 mantri aate hai or khanaapurti karke chale jate hai
 It is an autonomous institution to say, but looking at its functioning it does not seem that it is truly independent or the government machinery is not dominating it
 lekin usase bhi dukh kii baat to yah he ki iskaa str lagaataar girtaa hi rahaa he
 The fame it had earned in the eighties did not know when
 isaki prasaaran quality ko dekhakar lagata nahin ki yah ek rashtriya channel he
 Neither newness in news nor freshness in programs
 aisa lagata he ki ek aupchaarikta puri kar rahaa he doordarshan
 Or is this institution serving the interests of certain people
 taaja maamla he bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi ke intervyuu kaa
 Only a third of this 56-minute interview was blown up and more than that, the goodwill that Modi had spoken to Priyanka Gandhi or Ahmed Patel was also removed
 agar samay kaa abhaav tha to kuch anya hisse nikaal die ja sakate the
 Today, while all parties are seen with great contempt and all are using offensive words against each other, in such a manner, these polite words would improve the atmosphere
 inhen sampadit karke doordarshan ke adhikari kya sabit karnaa chaahate hai, yah samajhnaa kathin he
 Then when such a big interview is being broadcast, then not giving any information about it to the public is like a crime
 har tivi channel apane bade kaaryakramon ke promo, tiger vagairah dikhaata rahata he
 It is a common thing but the hidden manner in which Doordarshan aired it really surprises
 yah khanapuri kaa ek bada hi bhadda tarika tha
 Doordarshan officials forget that this institution runs with public money and hence their accountability to the public is also formed
 sarkaar ne bhi ek ajeeb niti bana rakhi he
 On the one hand, it has declared Prasar Bharati as an autonomous institution and on the other hand officers like IAS are there to govern it
 wo log jinka prasaaran yaa samaacharon se koi rishta nahi he
 He is sitting there in important positions
 parde ke peeche se soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke adhikari yahaan kaa prashasan chalaate hai
 There is no trace of autonomy here
 ab nai sarkaar banegi, kya ham ummid kar sakate hai ki isaki swaittata phir se behaal hogi or ek nishpaksh tathaa peshewar doordarshan hamaare saamne nae rang-rup main hoga? aisa ham isliye kah rahe hai ki chunaav ke dauraan baaten to badi-badi kii jaati hai lekin baad main kuch hota nahin

 court ne is par apni sahmati jataate hue kaha, 'hamen pataa he ki yahaan lagane vaali kareeb 50 fisadi yachikaayen blackmel ke liye hai
 The court said that is why we do not take notice on all the petitions now
 balki jin yachikaaon main hamen paryaavaran se judi gambhir samasyaayein najar aati hai ham unheen par aage sunwaayee karte hai
 'actually, a person from Vrindavan had petitioned the NGT that the construction of ISKCON temple is being done near Yamuna and this could pose a big threat to the ecological system there
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki ismandir ko banavaaneke liye alag-alag vibhaagon se enosi bhi nahin liya gaya he
 But during the hearing, the court found that NOC has been taken from all places for the Chandrodaya temple being built in Vrindavan
 takreeban 300 karod kii laagat se banane vaale is mandir ko 700 feet lanbaa banaaya ja rahaa he jo dharmik smarak ke lihaaj se vishwa main sabase ooncha hoga

 Input: from language vailentins de par madhya pradesh ke neemuch se ai ye real life story aapako andar tak jhinzod degi
 This story is of Akash and Bharti
 donon mangalvaar ko yani 'vailentins de' par hi court main shaadi ke bandhan main bandhe
 But the struggle of the two to see this day is difficult to exemplify
 akaash or bharti donon baanchada samudaay se hai
 The same Banchara community which has put a stain on the forehead of Malwa for pushing minor girls into prostitution
 bataaya jaataa he ki malwa ke neemuch, mandsaur or ratlam jilon ke kareeb 68 gaanvon main baanchada samudaay ke 250 dere hai jahaan khuleam veshyavriti hoti he
 In this community, there is no one but the parents who push the little girls into the swamp of the body trade
 mau-neemuch haive ke aas-paas chand rupayon kii khatir bacchiyon ke saath ye darindagi hoti he
 Surprisingly, all this has been happening for decades, but no serious initiative was ever taken to stop it
 kehete hai ki keechad main hi camel khilata he
 The same can be said for the sky
 baanchada samudaay main bacchiyon ke saath is tarah kaa bartaav dekhakar akaash kaa bachapan se hi khun khulata tha
 When Akash grew up, he took the initiative to save the minor girls of the community from this situation
 akaash iske liye 'freedom form' naam ke enjio ke saath milakar kaam karne laga
 Nearly 60 girls have been saved from being trapped in the swamp of the body trade by joining an NGO campaign
 akaash teen saal pehle aise hi ek rescue mishan par tha ki uski mulaakaat bharti se hui
 At that time, the minor Bharti told her that she wanted to study but her mother wanted to push her into the body trade
 akaash ne kisi tarah koshish kar bharti ko neemuch ke ek hostel main bhartee kara diya
 After this, Akash and Bharti started talking often on mobile
 lekin kuch hi din baad bharti ko uski maa hostel se nikaal kar phir dere par le gai
 Bharti's mobile was also taken away
 yaheen nahin apane samudaay kii panchayat bulaakar akaash ko bharti se dur rahane kaa farmaan bhi sunwaa diya gaya
 After some time, with the help of Akash, a dera was raided in the action of NGO and police, from where Bharti's mother was caught while carrying out a body trade with five girls
 phir akaash ko bharti kaa bhi pataa lag gaya
 Through the NGO, Bharti's living arrangements were made in Neemuch's ashram
 vahiin akaash ke prayaason se bharti kii padhai bhi shuru kara di gai
 Due to being late, Bharti could get admission in ninth class only
 akashnaballigaladakiyon ko bachaane kii muhim main jab laga tha, tabhi usne faisla kiya ki wo elelbi karegaa jisase is ladaai ko or behatar dhang se lard sake
 22-year-old Akash is currently studying for the sixth semester of LLB
 bharti bhi is saal 21 janvari ko balig ho gai
 Akash and Bharti decided to fight together to eradicate the stains on the forehead of the Banchara community
 saath hi shaadi kii door main bandhane kaa bhi
 On Tuesday, the time came for both of them to become life partners
 neemuch ke espi manoj singh ne is maukey par akaash or bharti ko sukhi jivan ke liye aashirwad diya

 america ke neuyork sthit trump tower main shanivaar ko aag lag gai jisamen ek vyakti kii maut ho gai he or chaar log ghayal hue hai
 According to media reports, the fire broke out on the 50th floor of the Trump Tower at 6 pm on Saturday
 ghatana sthal par damakal gaadiyaan turant pahunchin or aag par kaabo paa liya
 Earlier in January, there was a fire in this building, in which no one was injured
 bataa den ki yahatrump towamerica raashtrapati donald trump kaa he
 No members of the Trump family were present in the building at the time of the incident
 bijnesaman rahe raashtrapati trump kaa sara kaarobaar isi trump tower se sanchalit hota he or unka parivaar bhi isi imaarat main rahata he
 The Trump Tower is the second home of US President Donald Trump
 unka aadhikarik awaas 'white house' he
 However, Trump has spent very little time here since he went to the US presidential election
 aag se safaltaapurvak nipatane par raashtrapati trump ne twit kar agnishman karmiyon or ghatana kii soochna dene waalon ke prati aabhaar prakat kiya he
 Fire at Trump Tower is out
 Very confined (well built building)
 Firemen (and women) did a great job
 THANK YOU!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) April 7, 2018 According to the news agency Associate Press, an officer reported that Melania Trump and Barone Trump were in Washington DC
 america agnishman vibhaag ke mutabik aag imaarat ke us hisse main lagi he jo logon ke rahane ke liye bana he
 It can be clearly seen in the pictures on social media that flames are coming out of the 50th floor of the Trump Tower
 is ghatana main ek vyakti ke maare jane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Gandhi's basic training consists of not just books between teachers and students
 iske bich ek aisa hissaa bhi he, jo bacchon ko unke jivan kii sachai se jodta he
 This part was disappeared from our curriculum, knowing that it was Gandhi's only fundamental invention, he used to say about everything else that he had taken from the society
 buniyadi talim is jamaane main beete dinon kii baat hi lagati he, kyonki isamen shram par jor diya gaya he
 Emphasis has been laid on farming, farming, sanitation, cooking, sewing, embroidery, painting and many more activities, now if these works are included in the school curriculum, then it will not take long to become a newspaper or TV channel
 gandhi kii kitabon main likhi buniyadi talim kaa jeevant rup dekhne ko mila sewagram main
 The same Sevagram, where the Mahatma left the Sabarmati Ashram and built a hut
 takreeban 80 saal se mitti kii bani yah baapu kuti, aadi nivas or aakhri nivas ab bhi waisi hi avasthaa main he, jabaki har saal takreeban saat lakh logon ke pairon kaa vazan yahaan padataa he
 It is also part of Nai Talim in this campus, where Gandhi's thinking of basic education took shape
 desh main jab shiksha main amulchul parivartan hone ke baad shram ko ek tarah se aparaadh kii shrenee main daal diya gaya, usee daur main anand niketan skool gandhi ke is sapane ko jamini rup de rahaa he
 Recently went to this school
 pehla hi paath safai kaa
 There is a board outside the school
 blike board par kaksha kii safai kii jimmedaariyaan likhi hui hai
 There are groups of children for this
 har samooh kaa ek khubasurat naam he, mogra, sadafuli, camel, chameli, madhumalati, parijaat, shevanti, gulab
 Along with the name of each in-charge teacher
 saikil stand se lekar classroom tak
 Children are doing well for everyone
 par kya aisa duusare skulon main sambhav ho paata hoga, yaa jivan main or apane aasapaas kii safai kaa kya mahatv he, ise kis umr main aakar siikhaa janaa chahie
 Is it not a strange situation for our society that simple lessons of cleanliness were taken away from our curriculum and then we had to carry out all kinds of campaigns to teach this lesson! Competitions had to be held in cities and number one and number two had to be made
 bacchon ko saaf-safai karte dekh, apane kheton main kaam karte dekh hamen apane skool ke din yaad aa gaye, jab ham bhi aise hi sahaj bhav se apni shaala ko sundar banane kii jugat main rahete the
 However, this was because there was no peon in our school from classes one to eight
 ham chahen, to ise bacchon par atyaachaar kaa naam bhi diya ja saktaa he, lekin har shanivaar ko baari-baari se gaanv se gobar laane, pani laane or lipane kii kaksha hamen apni kaksha se prem karnaa hi sikhaati rahi
 Even in coming to the middle classes, we classmates decided to move from Acacia bushes to Bagdar to plant saplings
 haa, yah zarur tha ki isamen koi bhedbhaav nahin tha
 There was no caste-fraternity restrictions in this, so how did these lessons of life become so difficult with development
 
 
 ? bhedbhaav kii deevaaren kahaan se ain
 
 
 The Shouldn't the falling down of these walls start from childhood
 
 
 ?itnaa saral nahin he yah kaam
 Especially in this era, when it is not too late to stand up even on small matters
 yahi chintaa he is skool kii nideshak tai sushamaa sharma kaa
 Tai, who has been handling this new training-based school since 2005, worries that it is a highly sensitive subject, but necessary
 keval safai kaa masalaa hi nahin, kheti kaa paath bhi padhaayaa jaataa he
 Gandhi's concern was also that schooling is not village based
 usamen gaanv kii drushti nahin he
 The city does not even have a vision
 aise main anand niketan skool ek nazir he, jo bacchon ko unke aasapaas se jodatii he, har kaksha kaa ek khet he, khet main tarah-tarah ke beej hai, bachche unhen haath se laga rahe hai, kam pani main fasal lagane kii chintaa unhen pani or paryaavaran bachaane se jod detii he, uske liye alag se koi abhiyaan chalaakar yaa paath padhaakar jaagruk karne kii zarurat nahin padegi
 Every child in the school has a thong charkha, a class is also made of yarn from yarn
 chote bacchon ko nahin pataa, ve yah kyon kar rahe hai, bas shram kaa paath pard rahe hai, yah jaruri nahin he ki har kaary ke pehle uske siddhant ko jaan hi liya jaae, yadi ham siddhant se adhik vyavhaar ke paath padhaate, to shaayad hamaari schuli shiksha kii itani durgati nahin hui hoti, skool insaan bhi bana rahe hote
 a few km from the same school is the Gandhi Gyan mandir-bajaj Science Center in the city of Wardha, where about five hundred children study practical education every year
 10veen class ke nikhil takreeban 70 kilometre dur se yahaan aae hai
 It takes about five hours to travel, yet they like to come here because they get to experiment with books, learn by themselves, and learn in sports
 vahaan bhay nahin lagata
 There is a laboratory in every classroom
 kya ham apni buniyadi shiksha par itnaa nivesh kar rahe hai, kya aise prayogon ko or nahin badhaayaa janaa chahie
 After all, why should experiments like Anand Niketan or Science Center be called experiments, not mainstream

 It is now heard that Big b can be seen in the role of Sunil Dutt in this biopic
 aapako bataa den ki sanjay kii zindagi kii dastaan parde par ranbir kapur nibhaate dikhenge
 Sources reveal that since Sanjay Dutt is very close to the Bachchan family, Abhishek considers Abhishek as brother and Big b as father, hence the entire Dutt family wants to see Amitabh Bachchan as Sunil Dutt in the film
 film ke nirdeshak rajkumaar hiraani bhi is faisle se sahamat hai kyonki unhone kabhi senior bachchan ke saath kaam nahin kiya
 Apart from this, Hirani feels that no one other than Big b will be able to justify a person like Sunil Dutt
 biopic main drugs ke saath sanjay ke stregl, maa kii mrityu, naakaam shaadiyon ke alaava unke jail ke din bhi shaayad darshaaen jaaenge
 Ranbir was also chosen for this role along with his acting talent because he is also one of the closest people to Sanjay who will be able to do justice to Dutt's character as he knows him well
 agar amitabh bachchan kii sahmati is role ke liye mil jaati he to darshakon ko is film kaa besabri se intazaar rahegaa

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) In the case of the murder of anti-superstition social activist Narendra Dabholkar, the CBI believes that Sarang Akolkar may be one of the killers
 virendra taavade ke rup main pehali giraftaar ke baad sibiai ko is maamle main kuch ahm saboot mili hai
 Interpol issued notice against Akolkar to check the email of Virender Tawde of CBI arrested in this case of murder, a senior member of the organization had told Tawde to focus only on Dabholkar
 vahiin saarang do maheene pehle ghar lautaa tha
 a notice was also issued against him in 2009 by Interpol
 thane, vaasi or goa blast kaa aaropee he akolkarmumbai ke thane or vaasi sahit goa main hue blast main bhi vah aaropee tha
 He was on the radar of the investigating agency since his email contact with Tawde in 2013
 sibiai ke mutabikataavade ko giraftaar karne ke liye keval ye hi iklauta email nahin tha balki or bhi kai email the
 The emails that were sent before Dabholkar's murder were in contact with Akolkar, 46-year-old ENT surgeon Virendra Tawde
 akolkar kaa bhi sanathan sanstha se sambandh rahaa he
 All of these were sent before Emelsdabholkar was killed
 email se pataa chalata he ki sanstha ke 5 yaa 6 log is hatya main shaamil the
 Dabholkar's name in 18 emails of tawde-akolkar, CBI sources said that there were 18 emails in conversation between Tawde and a senior member of Sanatan Sanstha and Akolar in which Dabholkar was mentioned
 2010 kii teen email to or bhi mahatvapurn hai
 Foreign literature codewords were used for domestic guns and foreign guns for indigenous guns
 code verde main baat karte the taavade or akolkarye teenon apni baatcheet ko incode karne ke liye sanskrit main bhi baatcheet karne kii koshish karte the
 From the date and time of the email it appears that they were plotting the murder
 istemaal kiye gaye code kaarkaana ko dicode karne kii bhi koshish kii ja rahi he
 According to the ballistic report of Dabholkar, Pansare and Kalaburgi, the ballistic report of the Banglore Forensic Lab said that Hipnasare was also murdered with the weapon used in Dabholkar's murder
 pansaare kii hatya main istemaal kiye gaye duusare hathiyaar se kalburgi kii jaan lee gai thi
 After Tawde's arrest, the investigating agency can soon resolve both of these murder cases
 hindu virodhiyon ko mitaane ke liye thi sari taiyaarisibiai ko email ke jariye yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki akolkar or taavade hindu virdohi tatwon ke liye 15 hajaar kii sankhya main logon kii tainaati karnaa chahta tha
 Both started planning the murder of Dabholkar in the year 2008 itself
 sibiai ne sij kiya sanathan sanstha kaa sarvarasibiai ne sanathan sanstha kaa sarwar bhi sij kar diya he
 Dabholkar and Pansare's names are also recorded in the data recovered from this
 torget list main kuch police afasaron ke bhi naam hai

 -input language anna hajaare ke saathi kaaryakartaaon ke saath khule matbhed rakhane vaale rajd pramukh lalu prasad par team anna ne ravivaar ko paroksh rup se nishaanaa saadhaa
 Addressing supporters at the Ramlila ground during Anna's fast, Arvind Kejriwal said that the constitution was enacted by Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar
 unhone duniya kaa behtareen samvidhan banaaya, lekin agar unhen pataa hota ki netaa hi chaara kha jaaenge or kalaadhan swiss bainkon main jamaa kar denge, to vah sambhavat: isse nipatane ke kade praavdhaan karte
 Significantly, the former Bihar Chief Minister and former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad is accused in the fodder scam
 lalu ke hajaare paksh se tikhe matbhed hai
 When the Hazare side met Lalu as part of a dialogue with the leaders of political parties to clarify their stand on the Lokpal issue before the monsoon session of Parliament, the RJD chief tried to surround him on several issues

 While addressing Hazare supporters at Ramlila Maidan, Kejriwal once said that the Lokpal Bill should not be sent to a standing committee consisting of Members of Parliament like Lalu Prasad
 gauratlab he ki lokapal vidheyak ke liye sansad kii sthaayee samiti main lalu sadsy hai
 The ratio of success of Hindi medium students in UPSC exams has been in constant discussion for the past few years
 haal hi aae civil services pariksha ke parinaam ne bhi hindi madhyam se pariksha kii taiyaari main jute chaatro ko behad niraash kiya he
 The condition is that the candidates who take the exam through Hindi medium are not able to make a place even in the top-50
 haalanki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he or isliye sawaal hindi medium ke chaatro ke tallent ke saath hi khud hindi ko lekar bhi uthne lage hai
 The question is whether there is a shortage of talent in Hindi medium students? Is his thinking not worthy of the most prestigious service of the country? Or as the students are alleging after the result, are the students of Hindi medium really being discriminated against? What about the changed pattern of main exam? Answering these questions, TN Kaushal, a 2011 batch IFS (indian Foreign Service), who quit the IFS job these days, is teaching Hindi medium students success in Mukherjee Nagar, Delhi
 sawaal: 2015 ke civil services ke rigelt main hindi medium ko aap kahaan dekhte hai?jawaab: nishchit rup se is rigelt ko acha nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The future of any country determines its national language and if only the people speaking that language will not be in the highest service of the country, then obviously the future signs are not good
 sawaal: hindi pattee ke chaatro kaa safalataa graph achaanak se itnaa kyon gir gaya he? iske peeche kya vajahen aap mukhya maanate hai?jawaab: is kharaab sthiti ke kai kaaran hai
 The main reason behind this is the growing gap between India and India
 hindi aaj bhi bharat main angreji se kahin zyada boli jane vaali bhashaa he
 But it is not the language of the elite class
 yah gramin kshetron or chote shaharon ke saadhaaran janon or vanchiton kii bhashaa he
 Candidates of Hindi medium are backward in all respects, economically, socially and educationally, compared to candidates of English medium
 yaha maamla hindi angreji bhashaa kaa utana nahin he, jitna ki garib-amir, gaanv-shahar, sarkari or kanvent skool ke bhed kaa he
 Overall, this match is non-equal, so you can guess the result
 aap pichley kai varshon kaa rigelt dekhie
 Most of the toppers are coming out of big cities like Delhi and their family, financial condition is also much better
 sawaal: 2013 seupiessi kii parikshake mens kaa pattern badla, kya aap ise hindi medium kii safalataa graph girane ke liye jimmedaar maanate hai?jawaab: dekhie ek baat main spasht kar dena chahta hum ki hindi madhyam ke abhyaarthee kabhi bhi IAS kii pariksha main laabh ki sthiti main nahin rahe hai
 They have always been marginalized
 vigat 5 varshon se safalataa kii dar main kami aane kaa kaaran yah he ki pariksha kaa pattern teji se badla he or is sthiti se hindi madhyam ke abhyaarthee nipatane main vifal rahe hai
 Question: How do you think the changed pattern of the main examination for the students of Hindi medium has become crooked? Answer: Yes, you are absolutely right
 hindi madhyam kaa chaatr pariksha ke badalte swaroop main saamanjasy nahin bitha paa rahaa he
 Question: How responsible are the Hindi medium-run coaching institutes for UPSC exam for this result? Answer: No coaching institute can make a person an IAS
 yah baat jitani hindi madhyam ke liye sahi he utani hi angreji madhyam waalon ke liye bhi
 The difference is that most of the candidates of Hindi medium do not understand this and are completely dependent on the coaching institutes
 jabaki angreji madhyam ke adhikansh abhyaarthee koching to karte hai, saath hi anya sroton se bhi apni taiyaari ko apadet karte rahete hai
 Students of IIT institutions here are in a better position because they get the support of their seniors who have been selected for civil service
 aap dekhen ki angreji madhyam kii dilli ke karolbaag sthit sabase badi koching main bhi ek batch main adhiktam 200 ke aas-paas student hote hai
 But in a batch of Hindi medium coaching in Mukherjee Nagar, 700 to 800 students are studying
 itane chaatro ke bich pravachan ho saktaa he padhai nahin
 This difference proves that the tendency of sheep movement in Hindi medium is relatively high
 sawaal: aapako kya lagata he badale hue pattern main hindi medium ke chaatro ko safal hone ke liye kya ranneeti banani chahie?jawaab: darwin ke siddhant 'sarvival of phitest' ke anukool samay ke saath apni ranneeti main parivartan karke hi hindi madhyam ke chaatr is pariksha main safal ho sakate hai
 If you watch any topper's interview, one thing you will find common in all is that there is no shortcut to success in this exam
 apni kamajoriyon ko samajhate hue 2 se 3 saal kii ek thos yojana banaakar adhyayan karnaa chahie
 If you are serious for civil services, then you should not wander towards examinations like SSC, Railways
 sawaal: aapane taiyaari ke dauraan donon pattern main exam diya he? vyavhaarik taur par aap donon main kya antar dekhte hai?jawaab: puraane pattern or nae pattern main antar yah he ki ab rate-rataae uttaron vaale prashn is pariksha main nahin puche jate
 Now, instead of studying, questions based on thinking are asked, whose direct answers are not found in books
 sawaal: aap 2011 batch ke IFS (bhartiya videsh seva) hai or naukari chhodkar hindi medium ke chaatro ko padhaa rahe hai? aapako kya lagata he hindi medium ke chaatro ke saath kya dikkatein hai?jawaab: sarvice se brake lekar jab maine hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko padhaanaa shuru kiya tab mukhya samasya CSAT ko lekar thi
 But now the problems have become more complicated
 isliye maine sarvice se rizoin dekar is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya he
 i think Hindi medium has many problems
 inamen behatar gidence kaa abhaav jo ki IIT, IIM, AIIMS jaise sansthaaon se padhe angreji madhyam ke chaatro ke paas he
 Secondly, the student of Hindi is mostly a student of Arts and the mode of study and teaching in our universities is going back 25 to 30 years
 natijan saamaanya vishvavidhyalayon se padhaa chaatr IIT jaise santhaan se padhe chaatr ke saamne apane aap ko bouna paata he
 Those with arts have a university like JNU, but conduct their courses in English medium
 yuddh jeetne ke liye manobal ke alaava behatar hathiyaar, behatar takanic or behatar ranneeti kii jarurat hoti he
 Success can only be achieved by following one's own strategy and not by designing your own superior strategy
 isliye meri approach main mukhya antar yah he ki maine angreji madhyam kii ranneeti ke andhanukaran kii jagah hindi madhyam ke anukool ranneeti kaa vikaas kiya he, jo hindi ke abhyaarthiyon kii kamajoriyon or shaktiyon donon ko dhyaan main rakhkar taiyaar kii gai he
 i am preparing my students for UPSC in 3 phases
 pehle phej main meraa focus unki schuli shiksha kii kamiyon ko dur karne par he
 In the second phase, the emphasis is on enabling them to compete with the students of institutions like iits using technology like internet, youtube and in the third phase there is an emphasis on developing a sense of victory simply because the battle cannot be won by the loser
 
 sawaal: 2015 ke rigelt ke baad ek massej teji se soshal media par circulet ho rahaa he ki IAS bananaa he to angreji madhyam main padho? aapako kya lagata he hindi medium ke saath kamishan bhedbhaav kar rahaa he?jawaab: yah hindi medium ke chaatro ko bhatakaane kaa ek nayaa mudda he
 i know many students who went from English medium to English medium and the result is worse than before
 kami madhyam main nahin ranneeti main he
 Question: In the new pattern, what changes should be made by the students of Hindi medium in their learning strategy? Answer: Avoid the trend of shorthand and shortcuts adhyan kii vyapak ranneeti banaaen or maanak pustaken padhein
 The candidates will have to make the strategy three-tier
 1) pehle charan main apni kamajoriyon ko dur karen
 Overcome the shortcomings of your school education by reading standard books like NCERT
 2) duusare charan main IIT jaise sansthaaon ke chaatro ke mukaable main ignu jaisi paathya saamagree kaa prayog karen
 Use new technologies like Internet also in this phase
 3) tisare charan main librari kaa prayog karen or apni lekhan style ko viksit karen
 Let me tell you that TN Kaushal has received school education from Navodaya School in Kanpur countryside
 vah elahabaad uniwarsity se graduate or jeenyu se hindi sahitya main post graduate hai
 In Hindi literature, JRF TN Kaushal passed the UPPSC exam in 2005 and was elected to the Treasury Officer
 2006 main ve upi main dipti colector bane
 Passed the exam of UPSC in 2010 and became Assistant Income Tax Commissioner (IRS) and was then elected to the Indian Foreign Service in 2011
 lekin training ke baad kaushal ne naukari chhod di
 With the impact of demonetisation and GST, the country's economy is slowly recovering
 aise main buudhvaar ko aa rahe oktober-disambar timahi ke jidipi aankade modi sarkaar ke liye acchhee khabar laa sakate hai
 It is expected that the GDP growth rate during this period is 6
 9 fisadi rah sakati he
 If this happens, India can overtake China in this case
 pichley hafte hi aeroiters polmein ummid jataai gai he ki oktober se disambar timahi ke bich bharat kii jidipi kii raftaar 6
 May remain 9 percent
 jo anumaan royatres pole main lagaaya gaya he, agar aankade usee tarah aate hai to bharat china se aage nikal jayega
 With its help, India will become the fastest growing economy in the world
 jidipi ke aankade buudhvaar ko shaam ke kareeb 5

 bataa den ki oktober-disambar timahi main china kijidipi kii raftaar6
 It was 8 percent
 isse pehle 2016 main bharat kii jidipi main tej vruddhi dekhne ko mili thi
 It grew rapidly during the last three months of 2016

 Six teams have come together to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi's victory chariot
 in dalon ko milakar nai party gathan karne kaa elaan jediu adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kiya
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party, Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United, Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's Janata Dal Secular, Om Prakash Chautala's INLD and Kamal Morarka's Samajwadi Janata Party will form a new party
 sharad yadav ne kaha- sthirataa kii koi guarantee nahimbuudhvaar ko mulaayam singh yadav ke ghar par chali lambii baithak ke baad vilay kaa elaan kiya gaya
 Sharad Yadav said, 'SP, JDU, RJD, JDS, INLD and Sajpa will merge together
 aaj hui baithak main nae dal ke gathan kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The new party will be headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 vah hi party ke sansadeey board ke adhyaksh bhi honge
 'story of the scattered past names of the Janata Parivar, the flag and the election symbol are not yet decided
 Let me tell you that no decision has been taken yet on the party's name, flag, election symbol
 iske liye ek kamity kaa gathan kiya gaya he, jisamen echdi devgauda, lalu yadav, om prakaash chautaala, sharad yadav, ram gopal yadav or camel morarka honge
 This committee will decide the blueprint of the merger process and the strategy of the new party
 modi sarkaar ko chunauti dena hamaara maksadah lalu yadavalalu yadav ne kaha ki is vilay kaa makasad centre kii bijepi sarkaar ko chunauti dena he
 He said, 'we will visit the whole country and send the message to the public
 ham samaajwaad kii raajnneeti karke bijepi ko satta se bedakhal karenge or yahi hamaari niti he
 Bihar will be the first battleground
 'bijepi ko nahin roak paaegaa janata parivaara shahanvaj hussainis vilay par bijepi kii pratikriya bhi aa gai he
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said, 'this merger of Janata Parivar has been done
 wo bihar ko dhyaan main rakh kar hua he
 These people are scared
 unhen lagata he ki mil jaaen to bijepi ko roka ja saktaa he
 But this does not have to happen
 inamen vivaad hi zyada he
 Talked about merger but neither the flag was fixed nor the election symbol
 'argedy-jediu kii najar bihar chunaav parvilay kaa sabase bada siyaasi phayda rashtriya janata dal or janata dal united ko hota dikh rahaa he
 Till now, both the parties have been at loggerheads in the elections, many times even damaging each other's vote bank
 vilay hone ke saath donon partiyon ke votbank kaa saath aana tay mana ja rahaa he
 In terms of statistics, RJD got 18 in the last assembly election
 84 fisadi vot mili the jabaki jediu 22
 It was the largest party in the state with 58 percent of the vote
 aise main ab rajya main bijepi or narendra modi ko majboot chunauti milegi
 And if the BJP loses in the assembly elections, its effect will also be seen in the Uttar Pradesh elections
 nae janata parivaar kii loksabhaa main kul 15 siten hai
 (total Members - 543, NDA- 336, UPA - 56) SP-5 RJD-4 JD (U) - 2 JD (S) - 2 ANLD - 2 The new party has a total of 40 members in Rajya Sabha
 (kul sadsy- 250, endie- 57, upie- 80)espi- 15jedy(you)- 12argedy- 1jedy(es)- 1ieneldi- 1janata parivaar ko milegaa rashtriya party kaa tamgaa?nai party ko loksabhaa main kul 15 saansad hai or rashtriya vot kaa 7
 06 percent
 ye aankade to yahi bataate hai ki janata parivaar ko rashtriya party kaa darja mil jayega
 According to the current law, any political party which managed to win 2 percent of the total seats of the Lok Sabha or its members and elected its members from at least three different states, in such a situation, this party will be recognized as a national party
 
 takneekee taur par nai party ko rashtriya party mana jayega
 However, the Election Commission will have to decide on this because this merger is taking place not before the election

 Lokayukta of Karnataka Santosh Hegde said that a 'mafia-like' mining network is operating in Bellary where the state minister Reddy Bandhu has considerable influence and illegal mining is like a 'single window system of corruption'
 khanan ghotaale par report pesh karne ke baad hegade ne kaha ki unki reporton or siforeeshon par sarkaar kaa ricard kaaphi kharaab rahaa he
 Significantly, due to Hegde's report on illegal mining, the BJP leadership had to ask Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to resign, heading the first BJP government in the south 
 2 agast ko sevanivruth hone vaale hegade se jab unki siforeeshon or report par karnataka sarkaar kii pratikriya ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ‘kaaphi kharaab
 Hegde, a former Supreme Court judge, said, "the Lokayukta Act is stronger in Karnataka than in other states but its nature is in the nature of recommendation
" ise kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa yaa lagu nahin kiya jaataa
 Hegde said that many of his suggestions were not implemented in the interim report presented by him on illegal mining in December 2008
 taaja report main hegade ne kaha ki lokayukta ne bellari or usase lage jilon main mafia jaise network kaa khulaasa kiya he
 He said, 'you essentially have to pay 40 to 45 percent of your production and they (big people) will take full responsibility to deliver it to your chosen destination
 ’ reddy bandhu kii ore ek tarah se ishaara karte hue hegade ne ise bhrashtachar kii ekal khidki pranali kii sangya di
 The Reddy brothers have considerable influence in the Malamal Bellary from the mineral wealth and the Lokayukta report blamed them along with others
 unhone kaha ki bade paimaane par avaidh khanan ke kaaran aam logon kii pidaa hriday vidaarak he
 Hegde said the report mentions three companies being opened in different countries, including Singapore
 yah puche jane par ki kya ye companiyaan rajya ke mantri janardhan reddy or karunakar reddy kii he, hegade ne kaha, ‘haa, haa
 The Lokayukta has recommended in its report that the case of theft of foreign currency be sent to the Enforcement Directorate for investigation
 report main videshi mudra chori kii raashi par hegade ne kaha, ‘hamane iskaa akalan nahin kiya kyonki jo saamagree (niryaatit) darj he uskaa avamulyan kiya gaya he or iskaa akalan karnaa aasaan he kyonki ricard main iskaa mulya diya gaya he or jitani saamagree gai uske anuroop dhan waapas nahin aayaa
 Asked about the BJP central leadership's direction to resign Yeddyurappa after being convicted in the report, Hegde said he had nothing to say on the subject
 unhone kaha, ‘main koi raajnneetijna nahin hum
 He said that five Lokayukta officers worked without taking leave for 11 months on the report
 hegade ne kaha, ‘aap andaja laga sakate hai, agar aapako report taiyaar karne ke liye 40 lakh praptiyon or chaar lakh ricard ko dekhnaa pade

 The CBI sought a cancellation of his bail by a Delhi court without permission of Abhay Chautala, son of INLD chief OP Chautala, accused in the case of possessing more assets than a known source of income

 Special Public Prosecutor Ajay Kumar Gupta argued that it is not necessary for the court to write in the bail order that the accused seek permission before leaving the country
 unhone kaha, 'yadi adalati aadesh main iskaa zikr nahin he to kya iskaa matlab hota he ki aaropee sabooton ke saath chhedchhad kar saktaa he
 Similarly, it implies that the accused has to get permission from the court before going abroad
 ' After hearing the arguments, Special CBI Judge Sanjay Garg i reserved the order for 22 August on this issue

 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne kaha tha ki khilaadi prashaasak or indian olympic association ke purv adhyaksh hone ke naate abhaya 2-25 agast ke dauraan olympic main shaamil hone gaye hai

 Hindustan has swiftly dealt with its share of work, but Pakistan's malfeasance says that it is constantly screwing up and obstructing the path of holy darshan at Nankana Sahib
 unheen baadhaon ko dur karne ke liye donon deshon main aaj phir wagha border par baithak hui
 But the way Pakistan has been adopting evasive attitude, it does not seem to be going towards a solution
 khalistaan samarthakon par naarazgibaithak se thik pehle pakistan ne khalistaan samarthak gopal singh chawla ko vahaan ke sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti se hataa diya
 This is a major effect of diplomatic pressure

 But just before the meeting, when Pakistan released a new list of Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Khalistani supporters were also considered in it

 pakistan iske liye bhi raji nahin he
 Hindustan wants the pilgrims to have no visas or fees, but the neighboring country does not agree
 bharat chahta he ki pravasi bharatiyon ko bhi mauka mili, lekin pakistan sirf bhartiya shraddhaluon kii jid par ada he
 There are many such concerns of India which Pakistan has so far ignored
 lekin lahore pahunchi ajtak kii team ne vahaan logon se baat kii to unhone kartarpur coridor ko lekar donon deshon ke sambandh sudharne kaa bharosa jataayaa

 lekin anuj tyaagi ke dost ne use jhagada karne ke liye manaa kiya or use ghar aane ke liye bol diya tha

 khokhe kaa maalik sachin mritak anuj tyaagi or uske dost ko pehle se hi jaanata tha

 rashtriya janata dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ko samaajawaadee party main ho rahi foot kii vajah se behad chintit dekha gaya
 He also played an important role in reconciliation between father Mulayam Singh Yadav and son Akhilesh Yadav
 gauratlab he ki lalu prasad yadav rishte main mulaayam singh ke samadhi lagate hai
 Therefore, it is considered natural for Lalu to be worried
 lalu yadav ne is naate mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav donon se alag-alag phone par baat bhi kii or pita-putr ke bich sulah karne kaa suzav bhi diya
 Lalu says that he does not want the Bharatiya Janata Party to benefit from the sp's division in UP
 ve isse pehle shivpal or akhilesh ke bich upje vivaad main bhi apni ore se sulah ke prayaas karvaa chuke hai
 Lalu Yadav asked Mulayam Singh not to get caught in outsiders
 bahari se unka matlab amar singh se he
 At the same time, Akhilesh was also inspired to meet Mulayam Singh Yadav himself
 sulah kaa rasta bhi yaheen se niklaa
 
 
 It was a coincidence that at the time when Mulayam Singh Yadav was talking to Lalu Prasad on the phone, Azam Khan was also present there
 mulaayam singh ne unhen akhilesh ke paas bheja or unhen saath laane ko kaha
 Azam Khan went to meet Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, at his residence
 isi baatcheet ke baad akhilesh or ramgopal kaa nilabann vaapasi ke aadesh jari kiye gaye
 In this way, Lalu Yadav did the work of melting the ice that is frozen in the relationship between Mulayam and Akhilesh
 maaloom ho ki akhilesh or ramgopal ko ek din pehle samaajawaadee party se 6 varshon ke liye nishkasit kar diya gaya tha or 24 ghante ke bheetar hi unki party main phir vaapasi ho gai

 adishkti films praivet limited prastut is bhojpuri devi geet main khesari laal yadav or chandani singh kii hit jodi ne behtareen dance kiya he

 aajaglobaligeshan ke is daur main akasar yah sunne ko miltaa he ki rashtriya asmitaayen mitati-si ja rahi hai
 National definitions are becoming outdated by large-scale spontaneous and continuous movement
 mere bare main to yah bilatiort sahi he
 i was born in the Soviet Union, raised mostly in England, but also in Germany and Scotland
 ek dashak se main praha or moscow main kaam kar rahaa hum
 Most of my family lives in the US, i am married to a Russian and my children have more passports than teeth
 isliye rashtriya asmitaaon ke maha utsav vishwa cap kii baari aati he to main kuch uljhan main pad jaataa hum
 The passion of football stays on my head
 lekin main kiske paksh main aavaj buland karun, kismen josh bharun?maine jivan kaa 65 pratishat hissaa england main bitaayaa he (thik-thik kahen to landan main, jo sahi arthon main england nahin he)
 My heart says 'support England' and i know his team very closely
 main itnaa angrej bhi hum ki england kii naakaami par nathune phoolne lagate hai
 But i am also an Englishman, who knows that the first generation migrant cannot be such a true Englishman that the concerns of the country should rise above his head and speak
 aap shaayad aisa america main mahasoos kar sakate hai
 It seems strange here
 sachcha angrej banane ke liye teen peedhishaan lagati hai
 The first generation may be "russian / Polish", the second generation "russia / Poland, etc
", and the third generation may be English only
 torry diggaj norman tebit kaa vah mashhoor 'cricket sawaal' chakra dene vaala he jiske jariye kisi apravasi kii vafadariyon kii pariksha lee jaati ki uskaa dil cricket main england ke liye dhadkta he yaa nahin
 Only a newcomer will show his tendency towards England, which is not familiar to the British
 germany main baat alag he, jahaan meri kishoravay umr gujri he
 For decades after World War II, football was the only thing in which the people of Germany could proudly express their patriotism
 maine apane doston ko, jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan apane dada-naanaa kii karatuuton se sharmasaar bhale na hon par jhenpate jarur the, 1990 ke vishwa cap main khulkar apni vijayi team kaa jashn manaa rahe the, tab unki arya bhaawanaaon kii captaini mashin jaisi safai se khilne vaale lothar maithyuj karte the
 The rise of West Germany's football team coincided with the country's economic success with the end of the Cold War
 germany ke ekikaran ke baad ke dashakon main team kuch ghabrahat main dikhti thi, maano ekikrut germany kii team baari kamyaabi se duniya ko daraakar kuch jhenp-si rahi ho
 Now a new team emerged, which is full of non-german names — for example, Ozil, Khedira, Podolski, Gomez, Close et cetera
 yah team aakarshak, kisi dhara kii tarah bahati footbal khelti he
 Even if they lose, never because of their skilled feet
 is nai team ne germany ke logon main ek nai, bhumandalikrut german rashtriyata ko sweekaarya banaaya he or germany ke nae pravasi bhi is rashtriyata ke ang kii tarah ehsaas kar paa rahe hai
 The irony of the new multicultural nature of this national team is that Germany has generally rejected multiculturalism, with even Angela Merkel insisting on emigrating the German look
 1999 tak naagarikta khun ke rishte tak hi simit thi
 Multicultural England has greater acceptance in terms of public policies
 lekin jab baat footbal kii aati he to germany zyada khulaa desh ho jaataa he
 i think the people of Germany will welcome my madness to their team
 haalanki aisa karne kii maine abhi kalpana nahin kii he
 In Germany i went to a 'european school'
 yah nai tarah kii rashtriyata ke poshan ke liye europea sangh kii sthapana karne waalon ke jariye khadi kii gai vishesh sansthaaon main ek he
 According to Jean Monnet, the EU source, students from European schools will be "european in heart" and will be ready to realize a unified progressive Europe
 '' inamen anek chaatr europea sangh ke netaaon, afasarshahon or duusare patrakaron ke bete-beti the, jaise main
 The school was divided into classes of different languages, English, German, French, Dutch, etc
 ham mul paathyakram ek bhashaa main padhaa karte the or itihaas tathaa bhugol kisi videshi bhashaa main
 There were many good aspects to this experiment
 skool main har koi kam-se-kam teen bhashaaen jaanata tha
 But this experiment in front of Asmita's politics failed
 chaatr 'man se europea' hone ke badale apane deshon ke prati atirek main dub gaye
 His patriotism reached such an absurd level, whose visions are especially in the World Cup
 mujhe gustao kii yaad he, vah motaa-thulathula ladkaa apane italvi mul ko sabit karne ko is kadar utawala rahata ki vah duusari bhashaa main bolne se inkaar kar detaa tha
 Gustavo never lived in Italy
 vah brussels or francfort main bada hua tha
 Europe did not give him that feeling of life
 lekin kunbe-rashtriya mul kaa vah ehsaas mere liye mushkil he
 i was born in a country which is now missing from the map
 aupchaarik formon main janmabhumi ke khaanon ko bharna mere liye hameshaa duvidha vaala rahaa he: main soviet sangh likhata aayaa hum lekin ab internet par deshon ke naam kii suchi main vah nahin he
 That's why i now write Ukraine: i was born in Kiev
 lekin umr ke kisi bhi daur main mujhamen ukrainewasi hone kaa ehsaas nahin jagaa
 i used to be teased in English school as 'russian'
 mujhe saarvajanik jagahon par anglo-roosi kaha jaataa rahaa he
 When i tried to identify my origins, i lived in Moscow
 main vahiin tha jab roosi footbal team uthakar khadi hui
 In Euro 2008, with the inspiration of Arshwin, the team reached the semi-finals with amazing passes
 euro 2008 main rus ke bare main kai acchhee baaten huin
 That was when President Dmitry Medavdev moved towards liberal-oriented reforms
 pehali baar roosi team ko gas hindic ke rup main videshi coach mila
 His appointment was strongly opposed by the nationalists, but the success showed that Russia could succeed on the European path
 mujhe apane roosi doston ko holland ko haraate dekh khushi manaate, moscow ke stallin avenue par jhande lekar roosiyon ko jashn manaate, raat main chamchamati marcides par daudte dekh bada sukun mila
 Since then, Vladimir Putin stole that success through his right-wing nationalist political agenda
 ab ek baar phir roosi team ke coach fibio kapelo hai lekin ve kremlin kaa paisa paane vaale sankethik europea hi hai
 They do not have moral stamina
 is saal rus ne kreemia kaa adhigrahan kiya or ukraim main chhadam yuddh shuru kiya to mujhe pehali baar ukrainewasi hone kii bhaawanaaon kaa ehsaas hua
 i woke up in the middle of the night realizing that my grandfather was from Odessa, my mother and his family were from Kiev, my father was from Jarnowitz — and all these places are now shaking from the tank
 achaanak, yah ehsaas saaf-saaf ghar kar gaya ki bhumandalikaran ke tamaam sapanom ke baavjood rashtrawaad behad jaruri cheez he: yahi ekmaatr vah seemaa he jahaan har vyakti kii swatantraaa surakshit he
 So, i would have supported Ukraine in this World Cup
 samasya yah he ki vah team qualifi nahin kar pai
 Or maybe it is more relief from the problem
 ab england or rus bhi baahar ho chuke hai isliye main chaiyn se footbal kaa anand le saktaa hum
