 He said, i am against the word tolerance

 Why should you tolerate everything? It is an idea that you either accept or not accept? Why should you tolerate this? unhone kaha, ashishnutaa isliye hai, kyonki aap ise sahan kar rahe hai
 Do not bear it muslimon yaa hinduon ko apane sah-nagarikon kii tarah sweekaar kiijie
 Do not tolerate them

 aaj 'shiksha' kaa arth sakshartaa or suchanaatmak jaankariyon se samrudh hona he or aaj kii shiksha kaa uddeshy kisi shaskeey, ashaaskeey karyaalay kaa vetanbhogi adhikari-karmchaaree bananaa bhar he
 In this sense, education is far from its true form and purpose and is generating a crowd of unemployed people with half incomplete abilities by generating so-called education
 aadhunik shiksha kii isi apurna or asafal avadharana ko lakshya kar kabhi rashtrakavi maithilisharan gupt ne iske naash kii kaamana karte hue 'bharat bharti' main likhaa tha -shikshe! tumhaara naash ho ,tum naukari ke hit baniin
 This deceptive form of education in India came into existence in the British era
 angrejon kaa uddeshy angreji shiksha ke madhyam se bharatiyon main ek aise nae varg kaa nirmaan karnaa tha jo rajkaaj main unki sahaayta karke british rajya kii ritiyon-nitiyon ko sanchalit karne main tathaa unke shashantantr ko sthapit karne main sahaayak siddh ho
 He did not need nor did he make any effort to achieve the necessary objectives through self-awareness, value-consciousness, wisdom-sense etc
 through education
 unhen apane samrajya-rath ko khinchne ke liye tathakthith shikshit yuvaaon ke rup main aise ashv chahie the jo keval dana-pani or thodi si suvidhaon ke liye apane saanskrithik mulyon se katkar unki chakri main hi jivan kii sarthakata sweekaar karen
 Unfortunately, this disguise of education has developed in our country even after attaining independence
 parinamtah shikshiton ke naam par natikmulya-viheen suvidhajiviyon kii aisi baari bheed samupasthit he, jo kartavya-bodh se bahut dur he or adhikaron kii prapti ke liye hinsak andolanon par utaaru he
 a large group of about 422 pilgrims from the Jain community traveled by the 'indore Howrah Shipra Express' on August 31, 2018 at 6 am for a visit to Jainathirth Sammed Shikharji, located in Jharkhand, according to a news report published on September 1, 2018
 Arrived at Ganjbasoda railway station for but five unauthorized occupants of Bihar occupying the previously reserved seats of pilgrims The hundred youths, who were returning from Indore after returning from the railway examination, did not allow the pilgrims to travel
 jhagada, patharav, chenpuling jaisi avaanchhneeya gatividhiyon dwaara unhone niyamanusaar yatra ke liye paatr nagarikon ko unke nyyochit adhikaar se vanchit kar diya or apni suvidha ke liye aparaadh ke str tak jaakar aaj kii shiksha-vyavastha par gambhir prashnchinh laga diya
 What is this educated generation that misuses youth power by turning it into a crowd, in which it is aware of its responsibility; Neither has knowledge of his duty; Neither the law of our country and the sense of respect of citizens
 aisi tathakthith shikshit peedi se ham kis svarnim bhavishya kii aashaa kar sakate hai ? yuvakon kii apni samasyaayein ho sakati hai, kintu inkaa yah samaadhaan kadaapi nahin ho saktaa ki ve anya nagarikon ke adhikaron ke hanan par utaaru ho jaaen
 What public service will do after getting a job of such a unresponsive full mindset? This is a big question! Such occasional incidents of Bali accidents are a testimony to the fact that our current education system is failing to make good and disciplined citizens
 aae din ghatane vaali aisi durghatnaon ke liye keval yuvakon ko hi doshi tehraana uchit nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Education system, teachers, society and failing law and order are also responsible for this
 ham apane bacchon ko anushaasan kaa paath padhaane main asafal ho rahe hai
 Complete arbitrariness of parents, family members and teachers is unresponsive, and the purpose of education is being left behind
 shikshan-sansthaaon kii sankhya nirantar bad rahi he, kintu shiksha kaa str gir rahaa he
 Many reasons are responsible for the neglect of human values in the curriculum, non-availability of resources in educational institutions, loyalty of teachers and lack of teaching skills, unnecessary interference in politics in education sector
 shiksha keval sakshartaa athwa suchanaatmak samruddhi nahin he
 It is the art of making man a man; Is an effective factor of validating human values; Is a means of developing the conscience; Awareness of rights is accompanied by a sense of loyalty and dedication to duties
 shiksha kaa pratham tathaa antim lakshya desh or samaaj ke liye samarpit suyogy naagarik rachana he
 This requires major changes in the education sector
 yadhyapi swatantraaa-prapti ke pashchaat shiksha ke kshetra main parivartan ke liye anek prayog hue; ayog banaaye gaye; shiksha-nitiyon main parivartan kii duhai bhi di gayi kintu shiksha kaa swarup lagbhag pehle jaisaa hi bana rahaa
 Despite two-thirds failure, on the basis of one-third success, learners were sent to the next level
 keval kagaji praaanpatron ko hi yogyata kaa maanak maan lene se vaastavik yogyata kii pariksha sambhav nahin hui or har kshetra main alpakushal evam alpayogy jan pratishthit hue jisase lokseva kaa path baadhit hua
 At the practical level, more qualification and quality is required than certificates and titles because in the practical field, skill of work is required, not paper records
 yuvasakti ko uchit disha die bina ham shashakt, samrudh or surakshit bharat kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakate or shiksha kaa vikaas-rath yugin apekshaaon ke anuroop uchit path par agrasar kiye bina charitravaan-anushaasit yuvakon kii peedi kaa vikaas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The expected development of the country is possible only with positive future changes in the world of education
 isliye is disha main gambhir vichaar or praytn apekshit hai

 i have Head of Department - Hindi *** pus maheene kaa antim din poornima kaa hota he or is din mahasnan kii sambhaavna banati he
 People all over the world bathe in the holy rivers on Paush Purnima
 pus kaa maheenaa suryadev kaa mana jaataa he or poornima kii tithi chandramaa kii tithi hoti he
 Paush Purnima is found in such a wonderful combination of sun and moon

 That is, the day the moon is in full shape is called the full moon
 har maah kii poornima par koi na koi tyohaar avashya hota he
 But the full moon of Paush and Magha month is considered to be of great importance, especially for Hindus in North India, it is a very special day
 2018 main pus poornimavarsh 2018 main vaise to poornima tithi kaa aarambh 01 janvari se ho rahaa he lekin jis samay tithi kii shuruyaat ho rahi he usase pehle hi suryoday ho chukaa he
 Therefore, according to the opinion of the scholar, Paush Purnima will be considered from sunrise the next day
 is prakaar 2018 main pus poornima 2 janvari, mangalvaar ko he
 On this Mokshadayini Purnima, which welcomes the holy month of Magh, devotees worship Lord Shiva and meditate, earn virtue from charity
 pus poornima kaa mahatvapush maah kii poornima ko moksh kii kaamana rakhane vaale bahut hi shubh maanate hai
 Because after this the month of Magha starts
 magh maheene main kiye jane vaale snaan kii shuruyaat bhi pus poornima se hi ho jaati he
 It is believed that a person who bathes lawfully in the morning on this day is entitled to salvation
 use janm-mrityu ke chakkar se chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he arthath uski mukti ho jaati he
 Since the month of Magha is considered to be very auspicious and every day of it is considered auspicious, so whatever work is started on this day is considered fruitful
 is din snaan ke pashchaat kshamta anusaar daan karne kaa bhi mahatv he
 Magh baths start from Paush Purnima
 magh maheene main punyatoya nadiyon main snaan kaa vishesh mahatv bataaya gaya he
 It is said that those who wish to attain heaven in the land of death should bathe in the rivers during the whole month of Magha
 pus poornima tithi va muhurtapurnima tithi aarambh - 11:44 baje se ( 01 janvari 2018 )poornima tithi samaapt - 7:53 baje (02 janvari 2018 ) So, Asaram is a child rapist

 He is inside Siwan jail after the Supreme Court revoked the bail of former RJD MP Shahabuddin but now in his absence his wife has opened a front against the Bihar government
 shahabuddin kii patni hina shahaab ne bihar sarkaar ke mukhiya nitish kumaar par waar kiya he or kaha ki 'lalu prasad kaa saath dene kaa badla le rahe hai nitish kumaar
 Shahabuddin's wife Hina Shahab alleges that in 2005 when Nitish Kumar's government was formed in Bihar for seven days, Shahabuddin supported Lalu Prasad at that time, Nitish Kumar is taking revenge for the same day today
 yahi kaaran he ki patna hoicourt se mili jamaanat ko supreme court main chunauti dekar bihar sarkaar ne radd kara diya
 Shahabuddin's attitude was an attacker on Nitish Kumar by the time he got out of jail on getting the bail and went to jail on bail
 ab jab shahabuddin jail kii salaakhon ke peeche he to unki patni hina shahaab ne mukhyamantri nitish par hamalaa karne kaa silsilaa jari rakhaa he
 Hina Shahab said that when Shahabuddin came out of jail, Nitish Kumar felt that the atmosphere of fear has been established in Bihar but whether after his going to jail, there is now an atmosphere of peace, peace and brotherhood in Bihar
 hina shahaab ne siwan ke jila prashasan par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki sarkaar ke dabaav main aakar jila prashasan siwan kii kanoon vyavastha ke bare main galat report karti thi jabaki siwan main waisi koi baat thi hi nahin
 If law and order were bad in Siwan, how could such a large number of people reach Siwan
 hina shahaab ne kaha ki anyaay ke khilaaf ladaai jari rahegi, unhen apane samarthakon par puraa bharosa he or jab tak insaaf nahin mil jaataa wo shant baithne vaali nahin he
 Hina Shahabane also accused BJP MP from p Sivan, Om Prakash Yadav, that his rhetoric begins with Shahabuddin and ends with him
 hina ne kaha ki kab tak om prakaash yadav shahabuddin ke naam par siwan kii janata ke ankho main dhul jhonkate rahenge
 The people of Siwan are waiting for development and BJP mps are trying to confuse people only in the name of Shahabuddin

 The tensions between Sourav Ganguly and former India coach Greg Chappell are not taking any name, and now the former India captain has called this Australian 'crazy'
 sachin tendulkar or anya bhartiya ballebaajon kaa tilism todane main austrailian gendbaajon kii madad karne kii rapaton par ganguli ne kaha ki bhartiya team ke liye yah acchhee khabar he
 Ganguly said, "he has been the selector and also the head of his academy (australian Center of Excellence in Brisbane)
 vahaan se bhi unhen hataa diya gaya
 When he came to India, it was said that the Australian mentality would not work here but he could not work in the Australian structure either
 ’purv bhartiya captain ne kaha ki chapel koching ke har kaam main vifal rahe hai jo yah sabit karata he ki galati unheen main he
 He said, 'people should understand that the fault lies in the chapel itself
 vah galati par galati karte hai
 a person can be wrong once, but if he repeats that mistake again and loses the job due to this, then that person will be called crazy
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe khushi he ki vah austrailian team se jude hai
 This is good news for the Indian team
 main hairaan nahin hum
 Recalling Chappell's tenure, Ganguly said that the Australian coach was so domineering that the then captain Rahul Dravid did not have the courage to speak out against him
 unhone ‘aaj tak’ se kaha, ‘rahul dravid aisa vyakti he jo sab kuch acha chahta he
 He knew that something was going wrong but he did not dare to revolt
 mere saath zimbabwe daure par jo kuch hua, uske baad koi bhi captain dressing room main shanti banaaye rakhana chahega jo sahi bhi tha
 Ganguly, who played a key role in making Chappell the coach of the Indian team, was severely criticized by Chappell in his autobiography, saying that he used to spread restlessness in the team
 ganguli ne kaha ki chapel ke jehan main kabhi bhi bhartiya cricket kii bhalaai nahin thi or vah apni yojanayen thopane main lage rahe
 He said, 'greg Chappell's thinking was not cricket based
 vah nijee agenda lekar yahaan aaye jo bhartiya cricket main nahin chalaa
 His mind used to work differently

 shivasena ke varisht netaa or maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri joshi ne kaha, 'bilkul, yah udaar taanashaah kii style he
 This was Balasaheb's style and Uddhav too has adopted the same style

 Uddhav also mixes with various leaders, office bearers and does his work

 He said that the international honor and fame that Pachauri has received for his contribution in facing the challenges of climate change is his right
 singh ne dilli satat vikaas ke dasven shikhar sammelan kaa udghaatan karte hue kaha ki ipisisi kii prakriya or uske netritv main bharat ko puraa vishwaas he or vah uskaa samarthan karegaa

 Nobel laureate Pachauri is facing severe criticism from various regions for some aspects of the 2007 report of the IPCC in which the pace of melting of the Himalayan glaciers has been "wrongly" mentioned

 lekin saath hi yah bhi spasht kiya ki yah svaichhik patibaddhta he or baatcheet ke zarie kinhi kanoonee baadhyataaon se nahin bandhi he
 He said that it would have been better than the ambitious agreement which could not be implemented completely, the target that could be implemented fully would have been set
 singh ne kaha, ‘‘yah aisa sabak he jo hamane kyoto protocol ke sandarbh main siikhaa he
 An ambitious agreement that could not be implemented in its entirety would only place the prestige of the entire process at stake
 ’’ himalayan glaciaron ke pighalane par ipisisi kii report ke bare main chal rahi charchaa ke bare main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki isse sanyukt raashtra kii ikai ke mukhya anumaanon ko chunauti nahin milti

 sadan main kaarywahi nahin chalane dene ko lekar vipaksh apni jid par adi he
 The all-party meeting called by the government has also failed
 somvaar ko baithak main vipaksh ne saaf kar diya ki vah daagiyon ke istife se kam par maanane vaala nahin he
 Although the government also offered to discuss the issues, the meeting was a total failure! Prime Minister Narendra Modi opted out of the all-party meeting, whereas earlier it was discussed that he would participate
 sarkaar kii ore se venkaiya naidu or rajnath singh ke kandhon par vipaksh ko manaane kaa bhaar tha
 But the opposition did not listen to him
 baithak ke baad sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha, 'hamane sonia ji se sadan kii kaarywahi chalane dene kii apil kii thi
 We are ready for debate on every issue

 People are asking about their issues
 'congress kii ore mallikarjun khadge ne party line par chalate hue kaha ki jab tak sarkaar daagiyon kaa istipha nahin leti, ham virodh karte rahenge
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the opposition only wants to create a ruckus
 sarkaar har mudde par bahes ke liye taiyaar he
 There was a fierce uproar in both houses, before the opposition created a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi ko hangaame ke kaaran kareeb ghante bhar ke liye do baar sthagit karnaa padaa, jabaki baad main use dinabhar ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya
 The opposition also objected to Sushma's statement in Rajya Sabha
 up-sabhapati se bayaan ko record na lene kii apil bhi kii gai he
 As soon as the proceedings of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha begin on Monday, the opposition has adopted an aggressive attitude
 congress saansad kaali pattee baandhakar sadan main pahunche hai or hangaamaa kar rahe hai
 The opposition is demanding the resignation of Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan from the government
 hangaame or vivaad ke bich pradhanmantri bayaan de sakate hai
 At present, the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha have been postponed till 12 o'clock, while again due to uproar till 2 o'clock in the day

 Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj stood up and said that the opposition is making unnecessary fuss, while he has been ready for discussion for the past several weeks
 sushamaa ne kaha, 'main beete kai hafton se charchaa ke liye taiyaar hum
 But the opposition's intention is not to discuss
 vah to bas hangaamaa karnaa chaahati he
 All the allegations against me are baseless
 congress ne jin tathyon ke aadhaar par notice diya he, vah tathy puri tarah niraadhaar hai

 Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has also tweeted about this

 iske baad vipaksh ne hangaam shuru kar diya
 In the Lok Sabha, slogans of 'stop Speech' were raised

 An all-party meeting has been convened on Monday to end the opposition's stubbornness and opposition in Parliament

 Venkaiah said, "if the opposition demands in the All Party meeting, then the Prime Minister can give a statement
 ' sansad kamansoon satr21 july se shuru ho chukaa he, jabaki congress or vamadal pehle din se hi aakraamak tevar apanaae hue he
 Opposition parties have been demanding the pm's statement from the beginning

 Along with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also present in the meeting
 baithak main faisla kiya gaya ki jab tak sarkaar vipaksh ke maangon ko puraa nahin karti virodh jari rahegaa
 On the other hand, the government and BJP are not giving any indication to accept the demands of Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 congress or vam sahit vipakshi dal jahaan ‘istipha nahin, tab tak koi charchaa nahin’ par ade hue hai, vahiin bijepi netaa or mantri lagaataar yah kah rahe hai ki koi istipha nahin hoga or sarkaar vipaksh ko ‘upakrit’ karne nahin ja rahi he
 If the resignation is not work, meanwhile, the JDU has again said that work will not be allowed without the resignation of the ministers

 is bich, unhone danniel smith (42 gend par 62 ran) ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 146 ran kii record saajhedaari kii, jisase new south wales pehle ballebaaji kaa nyauta milane par do wicket par 203 ran bana gaya

 He said this on the question of journalists at his residence
 jab patrakaron ne sawaal kiya kii ek baar phir ek mahila ke saath thane ke andar durvyavhaar hua he, isapar aapkaa kya kahana he? to unhone sirf itnaa hi jawaab diya kii is bare main uparajyapal or police kamishnar hi koi jawaab denge, vahi maamle ko dekh rahe hai
 It is clear that the Chief Minister again cried the Delhi Police
 shila dikshit hameshaa se hi kanoon vyavastha kaa thikra uparajyapal par phodtii ai hai, is baar bhi unhone aisa hi kiya
 Bhagwan Singh, the SHO of the same police station, has been suspended and misbehaved with the rape victim at the police station in Delhi

 dilli main 7 farvari ko nai sarkaar ke liye vot daale jaaenge or main is baar aam aadmi party yshravind kejarivalko vot nahin duungaa
 i have many reasons for not voting for them, 10 of which are these
 1
 Arvind Kejriwal's government was engulfed in controversies during his 49-day tenure
 unhone kuch upyogi faisle jarur liye, lekin sarkaar chalaate hue ek prakritik sahajata kaa abhaav unke kaarykaal main dikhaa
 He called Janta Darbar, it flopped
 unhen sachivalay main media kii entry par roak lagaani padi
 Then, as Chief Minister, many people did not like to sit on his dharna
 main ajay maakan ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 2
 anbhavi ko kyon na chune?arvind kejariwal kaa kam raajnneetik anubhav bhi ek vajah he
 It has been a little more than two years since he entered politics
 usamen bhi sarkaar chalaane kaa anubhav mahaj 49 din kaa he
 In such a situation, why should we not choose an experienced representative to run our state
 main kiran bedi ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 3
 aarope lagaao kii raajnneetikabil-e-tarif he ki kejariwal kaa andolan mul rup se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf rahaa
 But at times why his campaign is limited to just a press conference and making allegations
 4
 What is the ideology? There is also a lack of clarity among the activists and people about the political ideology of the Aam Aadmi Party
 unke naaron main 'bharat mata kii jai' or 'inkulab jindabad' shaamil hai, lekin unka rujhaan na rashtravaadi najar aata he or na hi vampanthi
 In such a situation there remains an ambiguity about the policies
 5
 Whose occupation of the party? What is the reason that most of the leaders separated from the AAP cite lack of internal democracy in the party? The party seems to have a monopoly of Arvind Kejriwal
 haalanki bijepi or congress main bhi chuninda logon kii hi chalati he
 But the AAP has always claimed to run on ethical standards different from the bjp-congress
 kya AAP ko bhi vahi rog lag gaya?main kejariwal ko vot duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 6
 mila hua mauka ganvaayamahaj 49 dinon ke baad aayaa apratyaashit istipha ek badi vajah he
 Kejriwal apologize a million, you try a million to forget this fact, but this mistake still remains the backbone of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sarkaar main tike rahane ko lekar ab bhi unki vishwasaneeyata sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Opportunities lost in politics do not get repeated, and Arvind has lost an important opportunity
 main ajay maakan ko vot nahin duungaa, kyonki
 
 
 7
 kis aarthik niti ke pakshadharavittiya masalon par aam aadmi party kii raay abhi khulkar saamne nahin ai he
 For example, is his economic policy neo-liberal or socialist? He opposed FDI in the grocery sector, but is he completely against the concept of FDI? On which issue does she stand on the issue of investment? 8
 nai naukariyaan paidaa kar paaenge?bahut saare yuva kehete hai ki arvind kejariwal kii niyat to saaf hai, lekin unki kshamtaaon par sanshay he
 For example, if he comes to power, how will he create new jobs and opportunities? Will you be able to do it or not? i will not vote for Kiran Bedi, because

 The political modalities that Babbolapan Airwind uses seem populist
 gobhi jab 35 or 40 rupee kilo bik rahi thi, tab bhi ve chunaav prachaar ke dauraan use 60 rupee kilo bataa rahe the
 There is a kind of babbling in his nature
 10
 Where to get 20 thousand? Even if the Aam Aadmi Party puts the accounting of the funding on the website
 lekin usne aisi dinar partiyon se fund jutaya he jahaan 20 hajaar rupee kii thali milti he
 Obviously, the common man cannot buy a plate of 20 thousand rupees
 iskaa ek matlab yah bhi nikalataa he ki agar main kejariwal se milanaa chaahun to meri jeb main 20 hajaar rupee hone chahie
 Even if there are economic compulsions, it is not good for the leader of the common man

 2014 ke aam chunaav main wiesar ne congress ko pachhadte hue duusare number par pahunch gai thi
 After the YSR Congress came into existence, the influence of Congress in the entire state has come down sharply
 yahi kaaran he ki 2014 ke aam chunaav main zyaadaatar siton par congress ummidavaar 2 fisadi tak hi vot hasil kar sake

 google play store aae din charchaa main rahata he
 The news is made mostly for the wrong reasons
 khatarnaak eps, scam or mailaware vaale eps is par aplod kar die jate hai or ye yugers ke liye sar dard kaa kaaran banataa ha
 There is a similar report once again
 do saal tak chali ek study main paaya gaya he ki google play store par 2 hajaar se zyada eps nuksaandeh hai
 Some of these apps require more permissions, while some of them are completely malware
 ye report university of sidney or CSIRO ke Data61 ke hawaale se he
 Significantly, 10 million Google Play pss have been included in this research
 is research main baari maatra main play store par mailaware vaale eps or farji eps mili hai
 Apps that do not require location also access location
 is tarah ke eps bhi mili hai
 Location is an example, many apps have been found, which do not require permission, they are also accessing those apps
 Temple Run or Hill Climb Racing kaaphi popular game hai ye bhi in eps main shaamil hai jo jarurat se zyada parmishan lete hai
 Taking more permissions from your smartphone directly indicates that the developer can interfere with your data
 researchrs ne 10 million eps ko proces karne ke liye neural network or mashin larning kaa sahaara lene kaa daawa kiya he
 This algorithm was designed to identify apps with a type of text description and a variety of icons that resemble 10,000 popular apps in the Play Store
 is research main total 7246 eps ko khatarnaak mark kiya gaya or inamen se 2040 eps ko phek or hai risk vaala bataaya gaya
 Of these, 1565 apps demand at least five sensitive permissions
 acchhee baat ye he ki ye eps ap store se hataa die gaye hai or google ke mutabik ab ap sabamishan ke liye riject karne kaa pratishat badha diya gaya he
 This means that the up company allows selective apps to make the Google Play store secure

 The Guar crop has become a similar excuse for the farmers of Jaisalmer
 kuch samay pehle tak kisaan jisaki kheti se ji churaayaa karte the, ab usee ko lekar jamkar utsaah main hai
 This enthusiasm is bound to happen because they have an example like Mukesh Gaur of Kodiyasar village
 kuch samay pehle tak sir par khud kii chat ke liye tarasane vaale goud ke paas ab sirf ghar hi nahin he balki ve scorpiyo kii sawari bhi karte hai or nai jameen kharidne ja rahe hai
 There are many stories of changing life from guar in Jaisalmer
 vishesh rup se desh ke shushk ilaakon main boi jane vaali guar kii fasal main ai oochaal, videsh kii hi dein he
 In many countries of the world including America, the demand for guar gum powder for pasting in wells dug for oil and gas has increased so much that the prices of guar are touching the sky
 or iske saath hi, kisaanon ko guar main nae sapane dikhne shuru ho gaye hai
 If a farmer is buying a gleaming new car, then someone is trying to fulfill his dream of a lover

 However, it did not benefit the farmers as much as the traders because the farmers in large numbers got their crops from 70-80 rupees
 ke bhav par nikaal di thi
 Despite this, the farmers did not remain in deficit

 The list of such farmers is constantly increasing
 kisaan pehle guar kii boriyaan khule main hi chhod dete the lekin isaki badhati keemat ke kaaran chori ke maamle bhi saamne aa rahe hai
 However, it is natural to raise many questions about the speed of this crop
 jaisalmer main guar ke vyapaaree or guar gam factory chalaa rahe kaarobaari meetha laal mohataa kehete hai, ''yah vaaki apratyaashit teji he
 The reason for this is the tremendous demand for guar gum abroad
 jiskaa sabase zyada istemaal tel gas ke kuon main pasting ke liye hota he
 "they say that due to the great demand for gum abroad, many well-known industrial houses of the country are also trying their hand in this business

 Today, guar has made farmers and traders millionaires, which is why farmers are giving priority to guar cultivation

 Guar has been sown in 4 lakh hectare area alone
 is tarah 60 fisadi se bhi zyada ilaake main guar kii fasal kii buaai hui he
 If all goes well, this time Jaisalmer alone could produce around 20 lakh quintal of guar, with a potential value of Rs 40 billion
 se bhi zyada kaa ho saktaa he
 Many farmers have changed their fortunes through guar

 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri auratelugu desham partike adhyaksh chandrababu naidu jab endie se alag hue tabhi se kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki vah congress ke saath ja sakate hai
 But their intentions were different, they took the Congress along and are also trying to unite other opposition parties
 raajnneetik samikshakon kaa maananaa he ki naidu ne pehle hi bhaanp liya tha ki modi ke khilaaf ek majboot vikalp banakar ubharna he to alag raah chunani hi hogi
 Nitish Kumar could have been a strong choice, but he is currently in the NDA
 If Nitish had been out, he might have received more attention from Naidu
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki naidu kaa asli nishaanaa andhra pradesh he jahaan 2019 main loksabhaa ke saath vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 Assuming Rahul Gandhi as all party leaders, it cannot be said with assertion, Mayawati is ready to contest elections with Akhilesh, but it cannot be said whether SP-BSP will be able to form an alliance with Congress
 congress ko agar sammanit siten nahin milin to vah donon ke saath chunaav main jaaegi yaa nahin is par bhi sanshay he
 In such a situation, Chandrababu Naidu wants to be an alternative
 telugana main chunaav hone ja rahe hai, vahaan ke liye tidipi or congress se gathbandhan kii baat chal rahi he, haalanki congress ne yahaan pehle hi kah diya he ki vah 95 siton par ladegi
 One of the motives for talking to Rahul may also be that he wants more representation in Telangana
 119 siton valitelugana vidhansabhake liye 2014 main chunaav hue the jisamen tiares ko 62, congress ko 24, tidipi-bijepi ko 22 or anya ko 11 siten mili thim
 Somewhere in Andhra's electoral arithmetic, the real reason is that critics believe that tdp's coming together with Congress and moving away from BJP is the primary cause of Andhra's electoral arithmetic
 chandrababu naidu ko lagata he ki bhaajapa ke saath hone se muslim matadaata unase dur chhitak jate hai
 Muslims constitute around 9% of the population in Andhra Pradesh
 andhra pradesh vidhansabha main kul 176 siten hai pichley chunaav main bhaajapa or tidipi saath milakar chunaav ladi thim
 In this, TDP got 103 seats and BJP 4 seats
 yuvajan shramik raithu congress party (YSRCP) ko 65 siten mili thim
 The TDP feels that even if the BJP had not been together, their government would have become comfortable
 bhaajapa ke saath rahane se unhen duusare pradeshon main sweekruti nahin mil paati
 If they want to be strong choices then they have to go their own way
 kya bhaajapa ke khilaaf jane kaa phayda milegabajpeyi kii endie sarkaar main bhi naidu saath the, lekin baad main vah alag ho gaye the
 He also contested with Modi but then split
 aise main unhen yah bhi sabit karnaa he ki vah vaaki main bhaajapa se dur hai or use agali sarkaar banane se rokane ke liye vastav main prayaas kar rahe hai
 The stronger this perception is, the Muslim voter will come in their favor and they will benefit
 naidu guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se mili or donon ne bhaajapa ko haraane kaa sankalp liya
 He then met Sharad Pawar of Rankapa, Farooq Abdullah of National Conference, Sitaram Yechury of CPI (M), Mulayam Singh Yadav, patron of SP
 isse pehle vah basapa supremeo mayawati se bhi mil chuke hai
 She has also spoken to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on this issue
 lekin sabko saath lekar chalanaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 Uttar Pradesh, which has the largest number of Lok Sabha seats, has not been finalized between the SP-BSP and the Congress
 mamata banerjee ke bare main bhi yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah congress ke saath haath milaane ko taiyaar hongi yaa nahin
 Whether or not Mamata Banerjee will meet Naidu met Sitaram Yechury of CPI (M)
 phir bhi naidu se mulaakaat ke baad netaaon ne jis tarah kaa respons diya he usase garabijepi dalon ke ekajute hone kii aas dikhaai dene lagi he
 It is to be seen whether any concrete form comes out of this meeting
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke mukhiya mohan bhagwat ne ichha jataai he ki puri duniya bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaae
 On the occasion of the release of a book written on the life of the late Madan Lal Aggarwal, the co-founder of Friends of the Tribal Society, Bhagwat said, 'we want the whole world to speak' Bharat Mata ki Jai '
 ham bharat ko samrudh, shoshan se mukt or atmasamman se bharpoor bananaa chaahate hai
 For this, we have to live India in our life
 ’'puri duniya bharat ko salaam kare'bhagwatne kaha ki sanghathan chahta he ki desh shoshan mukt or aatm sammaan se purna bane or puri duniya bharat ko salaam kare
 He said that Vedas, 'dev Bhasha', 'adi Bhasha' and Sanskrit grammar were also composed in the territory of Pakistan
 sangh ke pramukh ne kaha ki bantwaare ke baad pakistan ne ‘bharat’ ke naam par daawa nahin kiya kyonki vah un gunon ko sweekaar nahin kar saktaa jo bharat main he
 Read: Simranjit Singh Maan said - 'mata ki jai ki jaye ho tohon hoon hoga' Lucky i am leading the Sangh 'bhagwat said,' But he (pakistan) adopted his name and left the name 'bharat' Because they cannot accept the qualities that are in India
 ’ ramayana kaa zikr karte hue bhagwat ne kaha, ‘ham kehete hai ki yah kaaphi pracheen he lekin yah itihaas he
 In a lighter vein, Bhagwat said that he is lucky to be leading the RSS
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe nahin maaloom ki chunaav hone par kya hoga
 But an appointment has been made here

 Bhaiya aur Bhehno if you're not looking at the BJP website right now- you're missing outxivya spandana ne ek din pehle twit kiya ki agar aap abhi bijepi kii website ko nahin dekh rahe hai, to aap miss kar rahe hai
 Let us know that the screenshots containing the memes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi got flooded on social media
 is mim ke neeche 'bohemian rapasodi' kaa mujeec video bhi laga he
 a meme has also been mocked, showing that Modi walks out when he steps up to join hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel
 unhen parade par dekhte hue teen peedhishaan jawan hui hai
 His work gained recognition and a long list of films
 unhone kalt se lekar blockbster filmein di hai
 The major parts of the 1980s and the 1990s have been his names
 ve hameshaa apane dance ke liye jaruri garima or khaas andaaj se bani-banaai chhavi ko todatii rahi hai
 Now 46-year-old Madhuri Dixit is coming again with Dedh Ishqiya to spread magic on the big screen
 is baar unke saath 27 varshiya huma kuraishi hai
 Huma's film journey has just begun, but she has gained popularity with acclaimed Gangs of Wasseypur and critics like love-shave Te Chikan Khurana and Ek Thi Dion around the world
 10 janvari ko relies hone vaali abhishek choube nirdeshit dedh ishkia ke pramotion ke dauraan donon ne kuch samay nikaalkar india today kii samvaaddatrasmita bakshise parade par aadhunik stri or antarangta par vistaar se baatcheet kii
 What did you think of each other when you first met? Madhuri: When i saw Gangs of Wasseypur, i thought, 'this is good
 yah actress he koun?’ phir dedh ishkia main acting ke liye huma ko sin kiya gaya
 We went to see the script in Shemaroo Studio
 ve platjo main thim or ekadam saadhaaran andaaj main
 She was looking at me and eyes were waiting to collide
 huma: mujhe yakeen hi nahin ho paa rahaa tha ki ye maadhuri dikshit hai!maadhuri: lekin shooting shuru hui to main inase kaaphi prabhavit hui
 i found it fast and beautiful
 huma: mujhe nahin maaloom ki mam ke bare main aisa kya kahuun jo pehle nahin kaha gaya he
 They are truly complete actresses
 ab main yah bhi jaan pai ki ve behatar insaan bhi hai
 Despite so much popularity, his humility touched my heart
 aap donon ke bich set par kya baatcheet hoti thi or kisi boding thi?maadhuri: film main ham aparaadh main ek saath hai
 We used to do Khusur on the set and everyone became insecure
 ham uske papa ke restaraan se lekar
 
 
 
 tamaam chizon par batiyaati thim
 Huma: (to Madhuri) How do your children rock
 
 
 maadhuri: ve bahut hi shararti hai
 We also talked about filmmaking, how it used to be before and what is the view now
 aajkal kaaphi badal gaya he
 We used to talk about my songs which he (huma) likes
 huma: inke saath kaam karnaa bada aasaan he
 (from Madhuri) i was quite surprised on the first day
 main saamaanya bane rahane kii koshish kar rahi thi
 Often when i get excited by someone's presence, i try to be extra ordinary
 ve mere liye halaat or mushkil bana sakati thim lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 Everyone was looking at them on the set, they are superstars but they were normal
 main unase yahi siikhnaa chaahati hum
 What big difference do you see in the cinema of the 1990s and today? Madhuri: There is no longer a borderline that it is a commercial film and this art film
 mujhe yaad he jab maine mrityudand kii thi to khub hallaa machaa tha
 People were asking why i was doing an art film and then i used to say 'what has happened, this is also a film
 ’ mujhe khushi he ki ab ye baaten puraane daur kii ho gai hai
 Now, all that remains is that it is a good film and it is not good
 asal main film to film he, use khaakon main kyon baanta jaae?aap sahamat hai ki in varshon main mahila paatro main ekadam nayaapan najar aata he?maadhuri: mujhe lagata he ki ab stri paatr sirf peedit yaa badla lene vaali hi nahin rah gai hai
 They are normal human beings
 vaaki isse taazgi kaa ehsaas hota he
 Huma: They are not goodies
 pehle auraton par filmein ronaa-dhonaa yaa maut ko lekar hoti thim
 There were no happy stories
 ve majboot aurat kii kahaniyaan nahin hoti thim
 She could have been a housewife or a begum, now she could be anything
 asal jivan ke kareeb
 If you are a step mother today, you are not necessarily bad
 jab main filmein dekhati thi us samay aurat yaa to behad khubasurat hoti thi yaa phir hataasha-niraashaa ke gart main dubi hui
 Today you do not have limited options
 yah achche daur kaa sanket he
 What difference do you see between the heroines of today and the leading actresses of 20 years ago? Huma (smiling): It is important for them to be beautiful even today
 maadhuri: pehle dance kaaphi ahm tha
 You had to succeed in every case
 aaj aap kah sakati hai, 'mujhe dance acha nahin aata’, phir bhi kaamyaab ho sakati hai
 You should just get good acting
 huma bahut acchhee hai
 She is today's Khanty girl
 dance to aap sikh sakati hai or mujhe puraa yakeen he ki ye ve film karengi jisamen hindi filmon kii mukammal heroin hon
 Huma: Yes, i will try my next film Dance Movie
 maadhuri: tumhen karnaa chahie
 It is also important
 huma se kya phayda mila or aapane film ke liye ek-duusare kii kis tarah madad kii?maadhuri: unhone sahajata or chizon ko aage badhaane ke liye josh bharne kaa kaam kiya
 His character of Muniya is quite complex
 aap katai andaja nahin laga sakate ki vah kya karne vaali he
 He has perfected the touch of mystery in the character
 isamen aisi koi baat nahin thi ki koun lead seen karegaa yaa koun baaji maaregaa kyonki us samay kairactor beasar ho jate
 Huma: We used to take care of each other about who is saying what
 is tarah hamaare bich dostana rishta ban gaya
 Today, intimacy is shown differently in films
 yah asal jindagi ke kaaphi kareeb he, 1990 ke sankethik gaanon jaisi nahin rahi he
 Has it taken a long time to come here? Madhuri: The audience is a new era
 aaj samaaj pehle se zyada khul gaya he
 Now there are multiplexes and you can make films for the audience you want
 yani koi film bacchon ke liye ho sakati he to koi puure parivaar ke liye yaa phir vayaskon ke liye
 Huma: Showing intimacy on screen is a bit tricky
 agar aap use sundar bana saken to behatar he varanaa vah acha nahin bhi lag saktaa he
 i feel especially uncomfortable because you have to rely too much on others
 is film main antarangta ke kai drishy hai lekin aise nahin hai ki das saal baad mujhe unhen dekhakar jhijakna pade yaa apane pote-potiyon se kahana pade ki film na dekhnaa
 Today our directors know how to handle a subject better
 yah uttejk nahin hai

 Police is investigating the case
 dilli main ek bujurg dampatti achaanak gaayab ho jate hai
 The only daughter of the house finds him everywhere
 par tamaam koshish ke baad bhi jab donon kaa koi suraag nahin miltaa to kuch din baad wo police main jaakar apane maa-baap kii gumshudagi kii report likhaa detii he
 But still there is no trace of both
 kai din or biit jate hai
 Then one day, a suitcase is seen floating in a stream
 log police ko khabar dete hai
 The police open the suitcase
 suutakes main maa band thi
 After this, another suitcase is obtained from the same drain
 duusare suutakes main baap band tha
 The girl was careless walking around with her boyfriend and police
 apane mata-pita ke kaatil ko talash rahi thi
 But know its reality
 wo khud hi apane maa-baap kii kaatil thi
 a murderer who first kills the parents
 phir laash ke haath pair todatii he
 After this, put the corpse in a suitcase and then throw it in the suitcase drain
 jab aaj tak ke reporter ne kaatil beti se poocha ki aisa kyon kiya to wo bataati he ki personal ishyu the kuch
 Would not like to know what were his personal issues with his parents
 to suniye
 She was married
 bwoyfriend hone kii vajah se pati se bani nahin
 In-laws left
 maa-baap ke saath rahane lageen
 Then the eye fell on the parents' house
 wo inaki zid ke aage jhuke nahin
 So in turn it killed them both
 reporter- kya personal ishyu the
 Sonia- Family Problem was Sir
 reporter- kya family problem thi
 Sonia - i do not have any hope of this
 ab aaiye jaanate hai
 
 ki aisi kya family problem thi jo maa-baap ko maar daalane ke baad bhi ye bataa nahin paa rahi he
 
 to suniye iske paapon kii ye kahani shuru hoti he isi maheene kii aath taarikh se
 On the evening of March 8, in this stream flowing in the Nangloi area of delhi, people caught sight of a strange thing
 wo maharun rang kaa bada sa suutakes tha, jo band tha lekin naale main aadha duba aadha baahar tha
 Seeing such a large suitcase lying in the drain, a passenger passing by suspected it and he informed the police
 foran dilli police mauka-e-vaardaat par thi or usne safaikarmiyon kii madad se suutakes ko baahar nikalvaaya
 But the police was surprised when the body of an elderly woman was found in the opening of this heavy suitcase
 laash ke haath-paanv tod kar use jis tarah se suutakes ke andar thunsa gaya tha, use dekhakar se saafe tha ki qaatilon ne apane shikaar ko kitni dardanaak maut di hogi
 However, the police began to identify the corpse and after a few hours of effort, the police also got success in it
 kyonki jo mahila gaayab hui thi, uski beti sonia ne laash milane se thik chaar din pehle yani 4 march ko pashchim vihaar thane main apni maa kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai thi
 That woman was Jagir Kaur
 sonia ne to apni maa jaagir cor ke saath-saath pita gurmeet singh kii gumshudagi kii report bhi thane main likhavai thi
 In such a situation, the police now felt that the killers had not taken Gurmeet Singh's life like Jagir Kaur? The police also felt that Gurmeet Singh was the only one who had escaped after killing his wife
 lekin kisi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle police tasalli karnaa chaahati thi
 And in this effort, the police continued their search operation even after finding the body of Jagir Kaur in this drain of Nangloi
 police kaa pehla shaq sahi niklaa
 After several hours of hard work, the police got another suitcase from this drain
 ye suutakes bhi thik pehali suutakes kii tarah hi baari-bharkam tha
 Now, without delay, the police opened the second suitcase and see seated that Jagir Kaur's elderly husband Gurmeet Singh came out of this suitcase
 par murda
 Now the biggest question was who ultimately killed both the elders and why? After all, what enmity was there with them? Was the murder due to looting or due to some rivalry? The questions were many and the police had to find answers to these questions and reach the killer
 ab police ne maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii
 He was to work on several angles simultaneously, but the first clue was also expected to be met by the family
 police ne is koshish main sabase pehle bujurg jaagir cor or gurmeet singh ke saath rah rahi unki beti sonia se poochtacha shuru kii
 Sonia had reported the disappearance of both of them to Paschim Vihar police station on March 4, while questioning neighbors and relatives revealed that both of them had not been seen many days before
 aise main police ko unki beti sonia par pehla shaq hua
 He had no firm answer to the question as to why did he delay so much in writing the missing report? While his other relatives were saying that Jagir Kaur and Gurmeet Singh were last seen around February 20-21
 ab police ne sonia par apana shikanja kasnaa shuru kar diya
 The police asked Sonia many questions
 sonia ne un sawaalon ke jawaab to diye, magar ruk-ruk kar
 
 
 Stuckingly 
 
 or to or sonia in dinon main jahaan-jahaan apni maujuudagi bataa rahi thi, uske mobile phone kii lokation se uski baat se match nahin kar rahi thi
 That is, Sonia was lying about her being there or not
 isi bich police ne ek or ajeeb ittefaq par gaur kiya
 Police noticed that Sonia's boyfriend Prince and two of his friends came to her house on February 21 and March 2, and Jagir Kaur and Gurmeet Singh were last seen alive in these two days
 gurmeet singh kaa to 21 farvari ke baad se hi koi pataa nahin tha, jabaki punjab gai jaagir cor ek march ko dilli lauti thi or 2 march ko rahasyamayi tareeqe se gaayab ho gai
 In such a situation, it was obvious that what was the relation between the disappearance of the two elders with the presence of Sonia's boyfriend Prince at her house? So when the police confronted Sonia with this question, Sonia once again started to falter
 or akhirkaar use maananaa hi padaa ki ye vahi he jisane apane bwoyfriend or uske saathiyon ke saath milakar apane bujurg mata-pita kii jaan lee
 This disclosure of Sonia was enough to shock anyone
 wo isliye ki akhir koi sagi beti apane hi maa-baap kii jaan itani vahashiana tareeqe se kaise le sakati he? or kyon? to police ko ab in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane the
 So now the police were asking and Sonia was telling
 sonia ne bataaya ki uski maa jaagir cor ke kisi kaam se punjab chale jane ke baad uske pita gurmeet singh ghar main akele the
 She wanted to get rid of her father
 usne 21 farvari ko mauka dekh kar apane pita kii chaay main nashili goliyaan daal deen
 He fainted after drinking tea
 chunki maut kii saazish pehle se taiyaar thi
 On receiving the gesture, his boyfriend Prince reached his house with his two companions and all unconsciously strangled Gurmeet Singh and put the corpse in a suitcase and disposed of it in the drain
 lekin abhi kaam aadha hi hua tha
 Because Jagmeer Kaur, Gurmeet Singh's wife, was still alive
 bujurg gurmeet singh kaa qatl ho chukaa tha
 The corpse was also disposed of
 kareeb hafte bhar kaa vaqt bhi guzar gaya or kisi ko kaanon-kaan khabar tak nahin hui
 In such a situation, the courage of Sonia, her boyfriend Prince and the rest of the killers was on the seventh sky
 unhen lagane laga tha ki ab isi tarah wo apni maa jaagir cor ko bhi thikaane laga denge or kisi ko pataa nahin chalegaa
 This happened to a large extent
 jaagir cor ek march ko punjab se waapas aa gai
 And the very next day, on 2 March, Sonia mixed tea with her mother and sipped tea
 phir behosh hote hi apane bwoyfriend or uske saathiyon kii madad se unki bhi galaa ghont kar hatya kar di
 The killers, like Gurmeet Singh, filled his corpse in a suitcase and threw it into the drain of Nangloi
 ab kaam puraa ho chukaa tha
 Within ten days, Sonia was relieved by setting up the parents' hideout
 lekin yahaan qaatilon se kai galtiyaan hui
 The first mistake was that he forgot to throw Jagir Kaur's corpse in deep water like the body of Gurmeet Singh and that suitcase was seen from a distance
 or suutakes dekh kar kisi ne police ko khabar de di
 The second mistake was that Sonia delayed writing the missing report of her parents
 jaagir cor kii laash milte hi pehla shaq sonia par hua
 After this, the rest of the lies in Taftish's light were gradually exposed
 sonia ne police ko bataaya ki maa baap kii jaan lene ke peeche personal dispute tha
 They did not bear my expenses
 magar, sach sirf itnaa nahin he, jitna ye beti is vakt bataa rahi he, balki police kii maane to ye beti apane maa-baap kii lakhon kii property hadapna chaahati thi
 She was so blinded by this greed that she did not even have to live with her parents

 India got independence from British rule on 15 August (15 August) 1947 and that is why the day of 15 August is very special for everyone

 Which we know from 'trist with Destiny'
 yah bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ke dwaara sansad main diya gaya pehla bhaashan he
 The Indian Prime Minister hoists the flag from the Red Fort on every Independence Day
 lekin 15 agast, 1947 ko aisa nahin hua tha
 According to a research paper of the Lok Sabha Secretariat, Nehru hoisted the flag from the Red Fort on August 16, 1947
 bharat or pakistan ke bich seemaa rekha kaa nirdhaaran bhi 15 agast ko nahin hua tha
 This was decided with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line on 17 August
 british house of comons main indian independence bill 4 july 1947 ko pesh kiya gaya
 The bill proposed the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan
 yah bill 18 july 1947 ko sweekaara gaya or 14 agast ko bantwaare ke baad 14-15 agast kii madhyaraatri ko bharat kii aazaadee kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 Mahatma Gandhi did not attend the celebration of India's independence
 jab bharat ko aazaadee mili thi tab mahatma gandhi bengal ke noakhli main hinduon or muslimon ke bich ho rahi sampradayik hinsa ko rokane ke liye anshan kar rahe the

 At the same time, some historians believe that Mountbatten considered the date of August 15 as auspicious, hence he chose this date for India's independence
 15 agast kaa din mountbeton ke hisaab se shubh tha kyonki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay 15 agast, 1945 ko japani army ne aatmasamarpan kiya tha or us samay mountbeton alide forces ke commander the

 The highest institution of democracy should be deeply concerned about how its role in determining India's economic and financial policies is shrinking
 During the last four years, the Modi government has completely ignored the role of Parliament in taking major economic decisions of the country
 lihaaja, aarthik faislon ko lekar agar kisi ko chintit hone kii jarurat he to vah swayan sansad he
 The control of parliament-legislatures on the financial behavior of the Government is based on two principles: One - no tax without representation and second - Government's wallet i
e
 control of public representatives over expenditure
 isliye bharat main sarkarein (centre va rajya) sansad kii manjuuri ke bina na koi tex laga sakati hai or na kharch kii chhot he
 The Budget (revenue and Expenditure) is taken from Parliament through the appropriation bill, Demands for Grants, Finance Bill, Consolidated Fund (consolidated Fund)
 bharat main sarkaar sansad kii manjuuri ke bina keval 500 karod ru
 And that too from the Contingency Fund, whose size in 2005 was Rs 50 crore
 se badhaakar 500 karod ru
 it was done
 pichley ek dashak main sarkaar ke kharch or rajasav kaa dhaancha badalane se sarkari vitt par sansad or vidhansabhaon kaa niyantran kam hota gaya he
 GST is the latest sample
 jiesti se pehle tak apratyaksh kar vitt vidheyak kaa hissaa hote the, sansad main bahes ke baad inamen badlaav ko manjuuri milti thi
 The entire process of tax on consumption is now out of the control of Parliament-legislatures
 jiesti kanoon ko manjuuri dene ke baad janata ke chune hue numaayindon ne indirect tex par niyantran ganvaa diya
 The GST Council is not a Parliament
 yahaan do darjan mantri milakar har maheene tex kii daren badal dete hai
 Read this: MODI @ 4: Where did the country's stock market reach in the last four years, what is the logic of these changes? Who benefits from this? Why is the discussion in the GST Council not public? How much does the GST Council stand for representation to impose tax? What will be the role of Parliament and CAG in relation to GST? Parliament and legislatures should discuss these questions
 bharat main sarkaron kii kharch bahaduree bejod he
 Increased dependence on debt makes interest payments a new record every year
 karj par byaaj kii adaayagi bajet kharch kaa 18 fisadi he, jis par sansad kii manjuuri nahin (chajrd expendichar) lee jaati
 Grants from state governments, panchayati raj institutions and other agencies account for 28 per cent of the budget expenditure
 sieji kii pichhali kai report bataati rahi hai ki kareeb 20 fisadi anudaanon par sansad main matdaan nahin hota yani ki lagbhag 38 fisadi (byaaj or anudaan) kharch sansad ke niyantran se baahar he
 The merger of the Railway Budget into the General Budget (2017) did not do any good to the Railways, but Parliament's direct control over the Railway Budget was over
 rail kaa kharch or rajasav kisi duusare vibhaag kii tarah bajet kaa hissaa he
 In the last three years, on the financial decisions, money bill (lok Sabha only) has been used a lot to cut off Kanni from Rajya Sabha
 gambhir vittiya faislon main ab puri sansad bhi shaamil nahin hoti
 After liberalization, the role of Parliament should be increased for transparency in economic decisions but
 
 
 swadeshi ko lekar aasmaan sir par uthaane vaale kya kabhi poochna chahenge ki videshi nivesh ke udaarikaran ke faislon main sansad kii kya bhoomika he, in faislon ko sansad kabhi parakhti kyon nahin he
 International investment, trade and tax concession treaties do not even see the face of Parliament
 vishwa ke kai deshon main in par sansad kii manjuuri lee jaati he
 When this is the condition of the role of Parliament in economic decisions, what will be the position of legislatures? When the government does not need to ask the Parliament for spending more than one-third of the Union budget, and one-third of the revenue to be taxed or changed outside the Parliament, then they should worry which in the democracy Vows to be omnipotent
 desh main alag-alag sectoron se lagaataar aa rahi mandi kii khabaron or share bazaar main giravat ke bich shuukravaar vitt mantri nirmata sitaraman ne ek mahatvapurn press conference kar ek ke baad ek kai elaan kiye
 Nirmala Sitharaman assured the country that the Indian economy is strong and doing better than countries like china-us
 vitt mantri nirmata sitaraman ne maang badhaane, udyog jagat kii chintaaon ko dur karne or bazaar ko sakaaratmak sandesh dene ke liye kai ahm elaan kiye
 However, economic experts are describing their efforts as insufficient in the current situation
 sitaraman kii in ghoshnaaon par india today (hindi) ke sampadak anshuman tiwari kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne aisa koi kadam nahin uthaaya he, jiske chalate arthvyavastha ko sthaayee majbootee milane kaa bharosa jage
 At the same time he expressed his opinion on many issues
 vitt mantri kii ghoshnah bainkon ko 70 hajaar karod rupavishleshanbbainkon main 70 hajaar karod rupee daalane kii ghoshnaa nai nahin he
 It has already been announced in the budget
 sarkaar bonds ke jariye paisa jari karti he
 Banks are not going to get any benefit from this immediately
 bainkon ke npas kaaphi zyada hai
 Finance Minister's announcement: Surcharge back on FPI Analysis: This decision of the government will not have much impact on the stock market sentiment
 haalanki kuch dinon ke liye teji jarur dekhi ja sakati he
 The problem is not that the surcharge was announced in the budget
 asal main samasya real iconomi main he
 Where growth is declining, savings are falling and expenses are also decreasing
 uske liye na bajet main kuch tha or na hi ab sarkaar ne uske liye kuch raahat package diya he
 Withdrawal of surcharge will not give such strength to the stock market, so that the permanent growth in the stock market can be seen
 auto sector or real estate sector ke sheyaron main giravat sarcharge ke itar, mandi ke chalate companiyon kii bigadati haalat ke kaaran bhi he
 Finance Minister's announcement: Will increase demand for auto sector Analysis: Government still has not done anything special to give relief to auto sector
 auto sector kii maang philhal tex main chhot or nai nitiyon kii he, jise lekar koi raahat bharaa elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 Finance Minister's announcement: Angel tax withdrawal from startups: When the economy declines, there is no demand

 Due to which the effect of withdrawal of angel tax will not be seen much
