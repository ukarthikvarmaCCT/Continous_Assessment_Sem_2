 desh main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii bahan priyanka gandhi kii raajnneeti main entry ko lekar unpar hone vaale nijee hamale thamane kaa naam nahin le rahe
 BJP MLA Surendra Singh, who is often in the discussion about his controversial statements, compared Rahul Gandhi to Ravana, while Priyanka Gandhi was called Shurpanakha
 darasal priyanka gandhi ko congress ne party mahasachiv banaate hue purvi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar saunpa he
 In this regard, when the MLA from Baria in Ballia district of UP was asked the question, he said that when there was going to be a war between Rama and Ravana, Ravana sent his sister
 ab ram kii bhoomika main modi hai or ravan ke rup main rahul ne apni shurpanakha ke rup main apni bahan priyanka ko maidan main utaara he, to maan ke chaliye lanka vijay ho gai
 Apart from this, Surendra Singh said that Congress is a broken boat
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main essi / asti act ke chalate chunaav jeet gai
 But now he is not going to apply any sandalwood
 bataa den ki jab se priyanka gandhi kii sakriy raajnneeti main antr hui he bijepi netaaon dwaara unpar hamale tej ho gaye hai
 Earlier, Vinod Narayan Jha, a minister and BJP leader in the Bihar government, said that Priyanka Gandhi is still a novice
 congress ko ye samajhnaa chahie ki sundar chehre se vot nahin miltaa
 After this, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi called Priyanka a woman with a tainted spouse
 vahi bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ne ek bayaan main kaha tha ki priyanka ke saath dikkat he, jo saarvajanik jivan main upyukt nahin
 She beats people
 priyanka kab santulan kho dengi ye koi nahin jaanata, desh ke logon ko yah pataa hona chahie
 Apart from Swamy, senior BJP leader and general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had said in his statement that he (congress) does not have a leader, so he wants to go to the polls through a Chokletti face
 
 
 
 
 koi karina kapur kaa naam chalaata he, koi salmaan khan kaa, kabhi priyanka gandhi ko le aate hai
 However, later clarifying in the matter, Vijayvargiya had said that he used the word 'chocolate' for Bollywood stars
 priyanka gandhi ko purv uttar pradesh kaa prabharee mahasachiv banane ke baad bijepi ke bade netaa unpar vivaadit tippanee kar chuke hai
 According to a media report, Upendra Tiwari, a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government in UP, said that by the time of Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka Gandhi's boys will also enter politics because Rahul Gandhi does not have them

 The pain of the 'doll of Delhi' reminded Amitabh Bachchan of the century superstar of his father's 'khoi Gujariya'
 amitabh ne twit main likhaa ki media ne pratik rup main jis ladki kaa naam 'gudiya' likhaa he use dekhakar unhen apanepita harivansh raay bachchan kii likhi ek kavita khoi gujariyaayaad aa gai
 Amitabh writes that a little girl who is lost in the fair, her mother is singing this song in search of her child
 vah apni kavita dwaara dusron ko aagaah karti he ki koi bhi uski gujariya ko naa to chheden or naa hi galat tareeke se pesh aaen
 Read this poem 'khoi Gujariya' by Harivansh Rai Bachchan
 meley main khoyi gujariya, jise mili mujhase milaaye,uskaa mukhadachand kaa tukdaa,koi nazar na lagaayejise mili mujhase milaaye
 Lost Gujariya at the fair, meet anyone you meet
 khoye-se naina,totare bainaa,koi na usko chidhaaye
 Join whomever you meet
 meley main khoyi gujariya, jise mili mujhase milaaye
 Beige curry, without brim, no one can embarrass her
 jise mili mujhase milaaye
 Lost Gujariya at the fair, meet anyone you meet
 tan kii goli,man kii bholi,koi na use bahakaae
 Join whomever you meet
 meley main khoyi gujariya, jise mili mujhase milaaye
 Will bring Chawni, who is my Munni, to bring Kaniya
 jise mili mujhase milaaye

 desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi or kabhi unke saathi rahe shankar singh waghela kii ek story in dinon surkhiyon main he
 This story has appeared in the English newspaper 'the Hindu' which is being widely shared on social media
 is story main modi or waghela kii kareeb 24 saal pehle kii ek 'train jarney' kaa zikr he jisamen in do netaaon ne apane vinamr swabhaav se do ajanabi mahilaon par gahari chhap chhod di thi
 Leena Sharma, a senior officer in the Indian Railways (traffic) Service, recounted her journey to Ahmedabad in the 90s in which she met Modi and Vaghela
 haalanki, safar ke dauraan hue parichay main modi or waghela ne apana naam bataaya to jarur tha lekin leena ko inke naam yaad nahin rahe
 Yes, this journey has been so memorable that these two leaders have not been forgotten
 baat us vakt kii he jab assam kii rahane vaali leena sharma apni ek bachmet ke saath dilli se ahmedabad ja rahi thim
 Leena was then a probationer in the railway service
 leena or unki bachmet kaa tikat conform nahin ho sakaa tha
 She met First Class Bogi's TTE, whom she assured to help
 kuch der main titii inhen ek kupe kii taraf le gaya jahaan safed khaadi kurta-pyjama pahane do netaa baithe the
 These two hitchhikers gave Lina and her friend a place to sit
 baatcheet kaa silsilaa chalaa to raajnneeti par charchaa hui
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was mentioned
 yahaan tak ki in do netaaon ne apane saath safar kar rahi in do mahilaon ko yah kehete hue gujarat bijepi jwine karne kaa nyotaa bhi diya ki wo tallent kii kadra karte hai
 Four veg thalis came at dinner time
 sabane bhojan kiya or sabhi kaa bill modi ne chuktaa kiya
 When it came to sleep, these two leaders got up from their seats and gave their seats to the two women officers and lay down on the floor laying themselves on a sheet
 train jab subah ahmedabad pahunchi to in do netaaon ne mahila afasaron ko dikkat hone kii sthiti main apane yahaan thaharne kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 Writing this story, Leena Sharma has mentioned the incident of one night before, when she was coming to Delhi from Lucknow
 us train main bhi unke dibbe main kai netaa the lekin unka aacharan bilkul bhadda tha
 The writer mentioned this incident in 1995 for the first time in an article written for an Assam newspaper
 us vakt leena ne gujarat se taalluk rakhane vaale do agyaat rajanetaaon ke naam yah lekh liya tha
 At that time, the writer had no idea that the two politicians whom she was referring to in her article would become famous in the coming days
 1996 main jab waghela gujarat ke siem bane to leena sharma ko behad khushi hui vahiin, jab modi 2001 main siem bane to lekhika kii khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 Today Modi is the PM
 leena sharma jab bhi modi ko tivi par dekhati hai, unhen 24 saal pehle kii wo 'train jarney' barabas yaad aa jaati he

 He has made a great contribution to the Indian team so far and has given us many championships
 lekin hamen unhen ghar bhejne kii itani jaldbaaji bhi nahin kerani chahie
 "he has already said goodbye to Test cricket
" ab apane bhavishya kaa faisla vah khud karen
 i think we should give them an opportunity to decide their own future
 'ejeeniyar ne kaha, 'mujhe vah acha lagata he, kyonki vah mujhe meri yuvavastha kii yaad dilaataa he
 Every player thinks that when he leaves the game, people ask why he is leaving, not people ask why he does not leave
 isliye unhen apane bhavishya kaa faisla khud karne den
 Appreciating the Indian Test team captain Kohli, the engineer said that he should be given a little more time before being handed the captaincy of all formats
 unhone kaha, 'viraat shandaar khiladeehain or nishchit taur par captain ke daavedaar hai, lekin mere khyal se abhi unhen thodaa vakt diya janaa chahie

 'input- IANS You are with Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka or not, but Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij is with him
 unhone kaha he ki ve mukhyamantri khatter se baat karenge
 The Chief Minister has said that he is an honest officer but the government has the right to transfer
 maamla itnaa simpal hota he is baat par dimpal pad jate
 If the transfers of the officers were beyond doubt, there would not have been all kinds of instructions from the order of CAT to Supreme Court
 24 saal main 46 baar tabadalaa ho to ho saktaa he ki thak haar kar aap hi kehane lagen ki khemka hi khwamkhah pange karte honge
 But if there was no habit of punishing, the BJP would not make an issue on their investigation, argue in Parliament and you would not know all this about a powerful person like Robert Vadra
 ab to haryana sieji ne bhi khemka kii jaanch ko sahi paaya he jisase pataa chalata he ki khemka khwamkhah pange nahin karte hai
 Thoughtfully put hands jis afasar main itane taqatvar shaks par haath daalane kii fitrat ho use khwamkhah koun apane paas rakhana chahega
 The CAG has said that Vadra's investigation was correct but the chargesheet filed by Hooda government on him is still intact
 tab bhi khatter sahab kehete hai ki ve eemaandaar hai or vij sahab kehete hai ki main unke saath hum
 Understanding what happens in transport departments across the country is not rocket science
 pocket science he
 In August 2014, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said that money runs in RTO a lot, so soon it will be scrapped and bring a new system
 magar aise kisi system ke aane se pehle hi khemka jaise afasar hataa die gaye
 So is this question also in your mind that there was no strict punishment in the department running more money than the car? If Khemka is honest, according to Chief Minister Khattar, is there no need for an officer like him in an honest department like Transport
 khemka 128 din bhi transport sachiv ke pad par nahin rah paae
 The Hooda government sent him to the archive department
 khatter sahab ne orcological department main bhej diya
 From the archives to the museum
 khatter sarkaar aate hi khemka ko transport vibhaag main sachiv banaaya gaya or hooda ke principal secreti eses sandhu ko purattav vibhaag main bhej diya gaya
 Now Sanghu Saheb has become the Additional Chief Secretary of Transport
 2013 main bhi archive department se raaton raat tabadalaa kar chunavi duty par bhej diya gaya tha
 Even then there was a lot of controversy about it
 tabadale ke adhikaar sarkaar kaa hota he or iske kai kaaran hote hai
 But is what is happening with Khemka really so normal? ol india civil sarvice act ke rule ke tahat diarector se upar ke adhikari kaa kaarykaal do saal kaa hona hi chahie
 In November 2013, the Supreme Court had directed the central and state governments to establish a civil services board
 jo tabadale se lekar posting, pramotion or jaanch vagairah kaa kaam dekhe
 The court also said that the Executive can reject the suggestions of the Board of Civil Services, but this will set a process and everything will be on record
 adaalat ne teen maheene ke bheetar board banane kii baat kahi thi, 30 march 2015 kii hindustan times kii report he ki sirf chaar rajyon ne hi aise board banaae hai
 Haryana, Maharashtra Chhattisgarh and Mizoram
 baaki rajyon ne nahin banaae hai
 77 pils had filed a PIL in the court to prevent arbitrary transfers and fixed tenure
 yah baat saarvajanik rup se jaahir nahin he ki khemka ke tabadale main civil services board kii koi bhoomika rahi he yaa nahin lekin ekaadh baar ko chhodkar unhone kahin tik kar kaam nahin kiya
 Not allowed to do
 centre ke carmik mantralay ne janvari 2014 main niyam bhi bana diya ki iees ipies or iesces kii posting kam se kam do saal kii hogi
 Hridayesh Joshi has again filed a report that changing the government does not change the days of honest officers
 inkaa istamaal vipaksh main hi zyada acha hota he
 Similar is the case of Sanjeev Chaturvedi of Haryana
 5 saal main 12 tabadale hue hai
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi had exposed several scams at AIIMS but Harshavardhan removed him from the post of Chief Vigilance Officer
 aise bhi tathy saamne aae ki chaturvedi ke tabadale ke liye maujuuda swasthya mantri nadda sahab ne patr likhaa tha
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi has filed an affidavit in the CAT or Central Administrative Tribunal and has raised questions on the Central Cabinet Committee for appointments
 is cameti ke adhyaksh pradhanmantri hi hote hai
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi has presented 14 such cases in front of CAT in which the Central Government has relaxed the rules and transferred many officers within 2 to 4 months
 dilli sarkaar ne isi sanjeev chaturvedi ko apane yahaan bhejne ke liye kaha tha magar aaj tak nahin bheja gaya he
 According to the news of Indian Express, Ashish Joshi, Member Secretary, Delhi Dialogue Commission, was charged within a month
 akhbaar ne sutron ke anusaar khabar likhi he ki ashish joshi ne aam aadmi party ke volatinr ko cordinator banane se inkaar kar diya tha
 According to reports, Ashish Khaitan called and asked him to step down
 is par dilli sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hoga jo shaayad sanjay singh is sho main de den
 But the whole thing is that why should not the transfer of Khemka be understood that an honest officer is being tortured
 eemaandaar afasar ke maamle main saare dal ek se hai

 After which the army recovered a cache of weapons by conducting a joint operation with the CRPF and the police
 mana ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon kaa yah thikaana kaaphi purana he kyonki yahaan kapade or hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 This indicates that the terrorists must have been here before
 sena ke sutron ke mutabik yah thikaana 10 saal purana ho saktaa he jahaan aatanki apane hathiyaar chhipaane ke liye jagah kaa istemaal karte hon

 vishwa hindu parishad (VHP) ke nae kaaryakari adhyaksh vishnu hari sadashiv kokeje aaj ayodhya main ramalala ke darshan karne pahunche
 Meanwhile, he answered many important questions related to the Ram temple
 ram nirmaan ke ek sawaal par unhone kaha ki ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan kab hoga, yah to bhagwaan ram hi tay karenge
 This is Kokje's first visit to Ayodhya after taking command of VHP
 ram mandir vivaad kii supreme court main chal rahi sunwaayee or is vivaad ko court ke baahar sulajhane kii koshishon ke bich kokeje kaa yah daura behad ahm he
 Know what Kokje had said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 
 
 
 Question- What will be the strategy for the construction of Ram temple and when will it be built? Kokjeka Answer - Ram Janmabhoomi is a symbol of our faith
 sabhi log ram mandir nirmaan ke liye patibaddh hai
 The efforts that have been made for this till date will be carried forward
 aaj kii sthiti bhi bhagwaan ram kii banaai hui he or aage bhi bhagwaan ram ke aashirwad se nyaayalay main ham jeetenge or bhavy mandir kaa nirmaan karenge
 After becoming the President of VHP, i came to visit Ramlala before going to India
 yaheen se hamaara andolan shuru hoga
 Lord Rama will fulfill our dream
 sawaal- kya VHP usee stand par adig he ki faisla chaahe jo ho, par mandir vahiin banegaa?jawaab-nyaayalay par avishvaas karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 Our side is justice and we will get justice
 nyaayalay ke faisle ke baad kya hoga, yah sab ham log saath baithkar tay karenge
 We have collective decisions here
 akelaa adhyaksh faisla nahin letaa he
 After the decision of the court, we will decide how to proceed
 At the moment, we are awaiting the verdict
 abhi tak intjaar antaheen tha, lekin ab nahin he
 The matter has now gained momentum, people who wanted to delay it
 har baar hastkshep karke ise rokane or isamen der karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 It was also tried that there should be no hearing on this issue before 2019, but now the court has decided that the verdict will be given after hearing the parties and taking into consideration the records which are in evidence
 hamako ummid he ki supreme court ram mandir par jald se jald apane nirnay suna degaa
 Question- The court will only look at the title suit and the land dispute? Answer - The task of placing the parties in the court has been given to senior lawyers
 nyaayalay main majbootee ke saath hamaara paksh rakhaa jayega
 However, we cannot discuss it publicly
 saat hajaar prishthon kaa hamaara uttar he
 Now it is up to the dignitaries who are advocating it and advocating it with full capacity
 sawaal- agle saal loksabhaa chunaav hai, to kya 2019 ke pehle ram mandir par faisla aa jayega?jawaab-hamen lagata he ki yah faisla loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aayega
 However, this has nothing to do with the election
 saal 1980 se ab tak kai chunaav ho chuke hai
 It is a question of faith of Hindus
 ise chunaav se jodakar nahin dekha ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, all political parties are Hindus and believe in it
 isamen ham raajnneeti nahin karte or na hi raajnneeti dekhte hai
 Question- With the arrival of Modi and Yogi in the state, it was expected that the Ram temple would be built soon, but not yet
 modi sarkaar kaa kaarykaal puraa hone vaala he, to kya aapako lagata he ki saal 2019 se pehle ram mandir par faisla aa jayega or iskaa nirmaan shuru ho jayega?jawaab-ram mandir par supreme court kaa faisla jald se jald aayega

 The occasion was the Samajwadi Party's backward leaders to start the Samajik Nyay Yatra and Adhikar Rath Yatra for the rights of the backward, which Mulayam and Akhilesh flagged off
 mulaayam ne kaha ki congress sarkaar kii niyat thik nahin he or yah aarakshan khatm karne kii sajeesh kar rahi he

 pradhanmantri ke is mishan kashmir ke kai pahalu hai
 On one side is the measure of development, on the other hand it is of agenda election
 dilachasp ye bhi he ki piem banane ke baad jammu-kashmir kii ye duusari yatra he
 When Modi reaches Ladakh, he will also have two gifts for the area
 modi aaenge to kargil main ek manch se suuni pahadiyon ko sapanom ke nae sabjbag dikhaaenge, jo sapane chunavi bhaashanon main dikhaae unhen hakeekat main badalane kaa bharosa doharaaenge
 Hence, the wait of the people for Modi is also unrestrained
 besabr isliye bhi, ki modi ladakh or kargil kshetra ke liye apane saath do tohfe bhi le ja rahe hai
 Therefore, according to the visit after becoming Prime Minister, Ladakh will also be important for Modi
 ye baat party or sarkaar kii taraf se bad chadhakar bataai bhi ja rahi he
 kargil-leh will get this gift - Modi is going to inaugurate two hydroelectric projects in Kargil-including 44 MW Chutak and 45 MW nimu-bazgo Project
 -iske alaava leh-srinagar transmishan line kii aadharshila bhi rakhenge
 Through this line, the Ladakh region will be connected to the northern grid of the country, thereby removing the power shortage in Leh and Kargil
 modi jis transmishan line kii aadharshila rakhane ja rahe hai, uski ghoshnaa 2003 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kii thi
 Since then, the hanging project has grown from Rs 300 crore to Rs 1700 crore
 ghoshnaa ke baad se leh srinagar transmishan line kaa puraa survey or physiblity study upie sarkaar main puri hui, lekin uski buniyaad rakhane kaa saubhaahgya manmohan singh ko nahin mila
 The gift for Ladakh is now in the hands of Narendra Modi, it is a reality
 iskaa ek siyaasi pahalu ye bhi ki ladakh ke logon ne modi kii lahar main bharosa dikhaaya
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP won the Ladakh seat
 modi ke liye acha mauka he logon ko shukriya adaa karne kaa
 The people of Ladakh have raised hopes
 ye modi kii yatra kii pehali kamyaabi he
 Modi will address these expectations

 Vijay Mallya-owned airlines company Kingfisher Airlines, which was given a loan of Rs 900 crore by state-run IDBI Bank, was still struggling with a huge financial problem
 2009 main march main company ko lone diya gaya tha
 This year the company reported a loss of Rs 1600 crore
 aisa nahin tha ki bank ko kingfisher airlines ke ghate ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 The IDBI Bank notes found that an internal note mentioned about these losses
 yani lone die jane se pehle yah note company ke baari ghate kii ore ishaara kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, a second note has also been found
 is note main company ke kaaphi prashansa kii gai he
 There is a lot of talk about the brand value of Kingfisher Company
 is brand ko coletral ke taur par plage kiya gaya, aisa note kah rahaa he
 Due to this, an unsecured loan was also given to Vijay Mallya's company at a lower interest from the market
 duusare note main vijay maalya kii kingfisher company dwaara korporate guarantee bhi di gai thi
 The airlines of this company were several hundred crore owned shares
 ascharyajanak rup se bank ke adhikariyon ne pehle note ko nazarandaaj karte hue duusare note ko zyada tarjeeh di or vijay maalya kii baari ghate main chal rahi kingfisher airlines ko 900 karod rupee kaa lone de diya
 Now investigators involved in the investigation of the case say that Vijay Mallya took a lot of this money abroad illegally
 bataa den ki ab is company ke maalik vijay maalya vivaadit tareeke se desh chhodkar landan ja chuke hai
 There is a demand for time given to Mallya when summoned by ED
 company ke ore se videsh dhan bheje jane ke maamle main safai dekar kaha gaya he ki videshon main airlines company ke bakaae ko chukaane ke liye inkaa prayog kiya gaya
 Two types of investigations are going on in this whole case
 ek jaanch idi kar rahi jo is maamle main mani londring kii jaanch kar rahi he
 At the same time, the CBI is investigating that there was no nexus between bank officials in giving loans
 tippaniyan In the absence of Mallya, the CBI has asked IDBI the names of the officials who prepared the two notes
 iske alaava un adhikariyon ke naam bhi sibiai ne puche hai jinhone maalya ko lone ko sweekaar kiya tha
 The CBI has already questioned Yogesh Aggarwal, then the head of IDBI
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki unhone vijay maalya se mulakaaton par zyada jaankaree nahin di he
 He also questioned that the decision of his officers should not be questioned
 iske saath hi unhone apane bachaav main yah bhi kaha ki jab unhone bank choda tab bhi kisi ne kingfisher airlines ko lone die jane par sawaal nahin uthaaya
 It was not that the bank was not aware of the losses of Kingfisher Airlines
 idibiai bank ke mili note bataate hai ki ek internal note ne in ghaaton ke bare main zikr kiya tha
 That is, this note was pointing to the company's huge losses before the loan was given
 vahiin, ek doosraa note bhi mila he
 The company has been highly praised in this note
 isamen kingfisher company ke brand vailu kii khub baat kahi gai he
 The brand was pledged as collateral, saying such a note

 In the second note, corporate guarantee was also given by Vijay Mallya's Kingfisher Company
 is company ke airlines kai sau karod ke malikana haq vaale share the
 Surprisingly, the bank officials ignored the first note and preferred the second note and gave a loan of Rs 900 crore to Vijay Mallya's huge loss making Kingfisher Airlines
 ab is maamle kii jaanch main lage jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki vijay maalya is paise kaa kaaphi hissaa gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se videsh le gaya

 is puure maamle main do tarah kii jaanch jari he
 An investigation is being carried out by the ED which is investigating the money laundering in this case
 vahiin, sibiai yah jaanch kar rahi he ki lone dene main bank adhikariyon kii koi santh-ganth to nahin thi
 The comments maalya kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main sibiai ne idibiai se un adhikariyon ke naam puche hai jinhone donon note taiyaar kiye the
 Apart from this, the names of those officers have also been asked by the CBI who accepted the loan to Mallya
 tatkaaleen, idibiai ke pramukh yogesh agarwal se sibiai pehle hi poochtacha kar chuki he

 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@isapnachaudhary) on Jul 28, 2018 at 8:28 am PDT lagaataar chauthi baar sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit karne par china dwaara vito lagane or pakistan kaa har tarah se lagaataar saath dene par china ne khud ko bharat kii suraksha ke virodhiyon ke pratham qatari main khadaa kar liya he
 Due to which there is deep anger and resentment towards China across the country
 abpakistan ke saath saath china ko bhi deshvasi desh kii suraksha kaa dushman maan rahe hai
 To give voice to this outrage and fury, the Confederation of India Traders (CAIT) has called for a boycott of Chinese goods from more than 40,000 trade organizations spread across the country, representing around 7 crore traders
 cat ne holi ke maukey par aagaamee 19 march ko desh bhar main chini vastuon kii holi jalaaye jane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he 
 The event will take place at Sadar Bazar, a stronghold of Chinese goods in the capital Delhi
 vahi desh bhar main lagbhag 1500 sthanon par vyapaarik sanghathanon dwaara yah holi jalaai jaayegi
 CAT has demanded the government to impose 300 to 500 per cent custom duty on goods imported from China in the first phase and keep a close watch on imports from China as it is expected to deal with large amounts of hawala transactions
 cat ne sarkaar se yah bhi maang kii he ki chini vastuon or ro material par nirbharta kam karne ke liye sarkaar gharelu laghu udyogon ko ek special package de
 CAT national president BC Bhartia and national general secretary Praveen Khandelwal told NDTV that the goods being imported from China raise some very serious questions in which what is mainly being imported is actually about the country's economy and development
 Is it important for the government, is the government getting the right revenue on the goods imported from China, is the reference to import from China Is there any transaction, whether the money given to the exporters of China is not used in the development of terrorist activities in India! Bhartia and Khandelwal said that in 1991, when the country's economy opened to global trade
 When we went, it was very clear that only the projects which require huge cost, yah dukhad he ki china ke maamle main in teenon kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 The imports from China are large quantities of ordinary commodities that are used in common use
 jo saamaan china se aata he wo acchhee quality kaa he yaa nahin isko dekhne vaala koi nahin he
 If the quality of Chinese goods is tested then our indigenous products will prove to be far better and we will not need to import from China
 unhone aage kaha ki yah bhi dekha gaya he kii china se jin vastuon kaa aayaat hota he unki keemat vaastaviktaa se kaaphi kam hoti he jiske kaaran unki vailuation bhartiya port par kaaphi kam aanki jaati he or usee ke anusaar us par custom duty or ijiasti lagati he jisase sarkaar ko rajasav kii badi chapat lagati he
 There is definitely complicity of officials in this
 isliye china kaa saamaan bazaar main sasta bikta he kyonki gharelu utpaadon par puraa tex lagata he
 This is proved by the fact that people who give IGST on Indian ports generally do not take IGST claim
 isse saafe jaahir he kii china se aayaat main baari gadabadi rahati he
 Therefore, CAT asks the government to conduct a high-level inquiry into the matter

 paakhi (sitambar-2011)sampadakah prem bharadwajindependent media inishiative socity,noida, uttar pradeshkimtah 70 ru
 The September 2011 issue of Pakhi magazine focuses on Rajendra Yadav
 visheshankon main amuman kisi rachanaakaar ke lekhan or vichaaron kaa vibhinn sandarbhon or vyapak pariprekshya main vishleshan karte hai
 But the analysis of Rajendra Yadav's personality in this issue is more, less of his literate, while his reputation as a narrator in post-independence India is unequaled
 hindi lokvrutt main ek saahitiyik patrika hans ke sampadak or saamaajik muddon ke vishleshak ke rup main unki bhoomika 1990 ke baad ek utprerak kii bani
 Yadav, who has seen eighty-two spring, is the messiah of lower class, anti-friction writers and activists
 samakaleen hindi sahityakaron main unka vyaktitv sambhawatah sabase zyada vivaadaaspad he
 The same contentiousness may have inspired the editor of Pakhi to draw a special mention on him, since the Hindi society has been in a festive mood for the past year with the magazine, seminars and seminars about the centenary year of its idols
 sampadakeey main prem bharadwaj ne rajendra yadav ko meraa naam joker ke hero raju ke man ke saath joda he
 He writes that "rajendra Yadav cannot be the great show man of literature" Raj Kapoor
 ''puure ank main rajendra yadav par vichaar karne vaale ve lekhak or banate hue lekhak zyada hai jinaki vishwasaneeyata abhi ban nahin pai he
 For this reason, the critical analysis article is short in this issue of 320 pages
 iske baavjood manager pandeya, priyadarshan, madan kashyap, asagar vajahat, tejendra sharma, bharat bharadwaj, rohinee agarwal or virendra yadav ke mili-jule moolyankan or sansmaranparak lekhon main apane-apane nazariye se rajendra yadav ke vyaktitv (zyada) or sahitya (kam) par ek najar daalane kii koshish kii gai he
 Among those writing in his favor and opposition, there is almost a general consensus about manager Pandey's statement that "rajendra Yadav is now a person of that mindset that is becoming rare in Hindi, which is called democratic
" ''yadav ke vichaaron ke centre main teen mudde khaas rahe hai-stri, dalit or bhartiya musalmaan
 His editorials on these three have been well known

 However, the interviews of Sudha Arora and Maitreyi Pushpa included in this issue definitely create a role to understand Yadav's female discourse
 aroda ke is kathan par barabas dhyaan jaataa he ki ''sharaarat karnaa jisaki fitrat main ho, vah khuraafaat karnaa apana janmasiddh adhikaar samajhta he
 "yadav's daughter Rachna almost adopts the posture of the accused
 ''ve sach nahin bolte
 They may be like an open book in front of the world, presenting themselves as an open book, people are convinced of their openness, but i do not believe that
 khaskar apane paariwarik jivan main ve gol-mol rahe hai
 
 
 He failed to apply his thinking in his life
 yadav vaise khud apane bare main bhi kehete hai, ''shikaayat dusron se nahin apane aap se hai
 
 
 The complaint till date is that despite hundreds of dissertations, my writing has not been evaluated realistically
 '' paakhi kaa yah visheshank nikalne ke baad bhi yah shikaayat bani hi rah jaati he
 Nevertheless, the editors of Pakhi deserve congratulations for the efficient combination of this special issue

 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi sthagitisase pehle rajyasabha kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi hangaame kii bhent chadh gai
 Due to uproar over Lalit Modi and Vyapam case, the proceedings have been postponed till Tuesday
 congress ke saath hi duusarevipakshi dallalit modi maamle main sushamaa swaraj, rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or vyapam maamle main shivaraj ke istife kii maang ko lekar ade hue hai
 Last week too, there was a lot of ruckus on these issues inside and outside the House
 shuukravaar ko hangaame kii vajah se loksabhaa kii kaarywahi somvaar ke liye sthagit kar di gai thi
 Congress mps will register their protest by putting a black band on Monday, while Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan can call an all-party meeting to end the deadlock in Parliament
 kahavatein or puraane sandarbhon kii lehren ek ke baad ek dimag main hiloren maar rahi hai, lekin koi lahar aisi chhap nahin chhod rahi, jisamen arvind kejariwal kii yah jeet samaa sake
 After pulling all the lines and running rubber on them, it seems that this is a farewell of old politics
 kam se kam dilli se to he hi
 Congress came down to zero, Congress is not surprised
 vah to isse hi khush he ki rahul gandhi kaa road sho kaamyaab rahaa or party main ajay maakan jaisaa koi vafaadaar he, jo bali kaa bakra banane ko taiyaar ho gaya
 Syapa is about the BJP, which is witnessing such a massive defeat at the peak of Narendra Modi's popularity, as he saw in the wave that followed the 1984 assassination of Indira Gandhi
 tab uske paas loksabhaa main do siten bachi thim aaj vidhansabha main uske paas 3 siten bachi hai
 Even many critics of Modi cannot say from the claim that the Prime Minister committed such a crime in Delhi in the last nine months that his party's purge should be cleared
 haa, unhone 10 lakh kaa suut pahanakar obama kaa swaagat jarur kiya lekin ise to aam aadmi party ne chunavi mudda nahin banaaya
 The sweeping victory of the swinging party in one cradle and the elimination of two hoarse national parties is a new kind of kink, which even the voters themselves cannot solve
 haa, ek cheez saaf he ki dilli waalon ne chaar saal pehle shuru hue andolan se janmi ek party ko 60 se upar siten di hai
 At the same time, two old types of political parties have been destroyed in Delhi, doing politics since above 60 years
 to kya dilli waalon ko raajnneeti khatm karne ke vaade or janata kaa raaj laane ke iraade se saamne aae kejariwal itane pasand aa gaye ki vah puraane raajnneetik dalon ko phooti aankh nahin dekhnaa chaah rahi
 Delhi's mandate rests entirely with the agitator who promised the public that the direction of his movement will now be only constructive and will not have the elements to go off the road every now and then
 janata ne mana ki sharaab baantne vaali raajnneeti, netaaon ke paanv choote kaaryakartaaon kii bheed vaali raajnneeti, jaat or dharm ke oche sameekaran saadhane vaali raajnneeti or chunaav ke baad janata ko sadqachhaap samajhane vaali raajnneeti ab use nahin chahie
 He needs the prime minister to use a muffler on his ears in case of a cold, instead of the prime minister who hangs a shawl unnecessarily on his shoulder, and the crown prince who is wearing a blank sleeve
 use vah netaa chahie to badi reliyaan yaa road sho ke bajaay nukkad sabhaaon par jor de rahaa he
 Overall, after fulfilling the great ambition of making Modi the Prime Minister, the public came out full scope to give his heart to Kejriwal, who became a common man from the country's top officer
 lekin dil ke rishte bade najuk hote hai
 The big promises that Kejriwal made to the public have been given to him by a large majority
 janata ab kadial mahajan ho gai he
 She lends her vote support to you on the credibility of your promises, but if you do not get the return of money on the fixed tenure, then your attachment will not stop
 ab tak shila dikshit, rahul gandhi or narendra modi yah dekh chuke hai
 The people of new moods are doing the old politics by-bye, but the imposition of the old terms on the new politics will not deter
 kal se dilli main free vaai-fi kii maang shuru ho jaaegi
 People will say that they are waiting for an ambulance at home faster than home delivery of pizza
 vot main taanaashaahee dikhaane vaali janata dilli ke aspataalon kii opidi kii lambii line bardaasht nahin karegi
 Slum dwellers would now like to have as many toilets installed in their slums as there are television viewing umbrellas
 ve yah bhi chahenge ki unke bachche sahab logon ke bacchon kii tarah acchhee talim paaen
 Many more good things are embedded in his dreams
 log isi ko nai raajnneeti maan rahe hai or isi kii khatir unhone puraani raajnneeti se tauba kii he
 Kejriwal sir, Delhi people have given you 96 percent seats, you will have to fulfill at least 48 percent promises
 or iske liye aapke paas kitna vakt he, yah janata nahin bataaegi
 You should ask this while drinking Modi ji's tea
 police kii giraft main aae bhartiya police seva (ipies) ke ek adhikari kii nishandehi par 25 kilogram heroin baraamad kiya gaya he
 The latest consignment of heroin has been seized from the Nyagaon flat in Vasai area of mumbai

 Significantly, on Sunday, an IPA officer Shaji was arrested along with Herine
 baharhaal, puure maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 The history of the world of crime is replete with the misdeeds of many dreadful criminals
 inhen main aise kaatil bhi shaamil hai, jinhone ek do nahin balki kai kai katl kiye
 Not only the murder, but the dead bodies of those who died, the extent of humanity was also shown
 aisa hi ek naam he rus ke kukhyat serial killer andrei shikatilo kaa
 In Russia, this name is nothing short of awe
 wo pehle mahilaon kii hatya karata tha
 Then he had a physical relationship with his corpse
 andrei shikatilo kaa janm 16 oktober, 1936 ko soviet rus ke ukraine main hua tha
 He was a teacher by profession
 lekin wo bachapan main yon hin bhaavana se grast ho gaya tha
 As a result, he used to think about it all the time
 uske sir par junun savaar ho jaataa tha
 In which he was ready to do anything
 yahi vajah thi ki use mahilaon kaa katl kar apni havas mitaane kii lat lag gai thi
 Statistics from Russia's criminal history show that between 1978 and 1990, Andrei Chicatillo murdered more than 56 people
 uske nishane par adhikar mahilaayein hoti thim
 He would have killed women by throwing women into his web on the pretext of drugs
 use ek ajeeb tarah kaa shauk tha
 He used to expose women before murder
 phir unke haath-pair baandh detaa tha
 After this, until the woman could understand something, he would kill her
 hatya ke baad wo mahila kii laash ke saath shaareerik sambandh banaata tha
 After erasing his lust, Andrei would take his victim's eyes out
 uske baad wo mahila ke privet part kaat diya karata tha
 As if Satan used to ride on his head at that time
 rus ke police record ke mutabik andrei shikatilo ne apana pehla shikaar 1981 main 17 saal kii ek ladki ko banaaya tha
 He was so infamous with his disgusting and creepy incidents that he was also known as Butcher of Rostov, The Red Reaper and The Rostov Reaper
 lekin kehete hai ki jurm ke paanv nahin hote
 Finally one day this freak killer got caught by the police
 police ne 20 november, 1990 ko andrei shikatilo ko giraftaar kiya
 Surprisingly, despite being caught, he did not confess his crime
 adaalat main maamla chalata rahaa
 But on 14 February 1994, he was sentenced for his crimes
 uske sir main goli markar uski hatya kar di gai thi
 Fukrey fame Pulkit Samrat is often in the news for his personal life
 salmaan khan kii raakhi bahan shweta rohira se alag hone ke baad wo actress yami gautam ke saath relationships main rahe
 But after some time both of them broke up

 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke loksabhaa saansad pappu yadav ne aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal kii shaan main kaside padhate hue kaha he ki narendra modi se mukaable ke liye kejariwal kii zarurat he
 According to Pappu Yadav, Kejriwal is the great hero of 42 crore youth of the country and the country desperately needs him to fight Modi's lies
 pappu yadav kaa suzav janata parivaar ke ekikaran ke saath-saath zarurat kejariwal ko bhi usase jodne kaa he, tabhi nayaa ban rahaa morcha modi ko majboot takkar de paaegaa
 Let it be known that the exercise to connect the Janata Dal family is going on
 jediu, jedies, argedy, samaajawaadee party jaisi tamaam partiyaan aapas main milakar ek majboot party banane kii koshish hai
 a big meeting has also been held in this regard in Mulayam's house
 ab tak yahi mana ja rahaa he ki isaki kaman mulaayam singh yadav ke haathon main hogi
 Pappu Yadav is not raising any direct questions on the leadership of Mulayam Singh Yadav, but he is of the opinion that forward Kejriwal will be able to reach the youth who are associated with Kejriwal in lakhs
 yah puche jane par ki jis kejariwal ne mulaayam or lalu par na sirf parivaarwaad kaa aarope lagaaya, balki bhrashtachar ke liye bhi inhen jamkar kosa, kaise unako mulaayam or lalu saath le sakate hai, pappu yadav ne sapaat shabdon main kaha ki bade mukaam ke liye choti-choti baton ko bhula dena chahie
 On the question of why only Kejriwal will join such parties on which he has been raining, Pappu Yadav said that Kejriwal has to understand the practicality of political entrenchment
 kejariwal ke dilli main 49 dinon ke shashan kaa gungan karte hue pappu yadav kehete hai unhone system se ladane kii or use badalane kii koshish kii
 This quality inside him makes him great
 lekin ab sawaal he ki kejariwal jin netaaon ko khalanaayak bataate rahe hai, ab vah unhen apana naayakatv kyon dene lage
 In fact, Lalu, weakened by the electoral defeat, is not in a position to take any disciplinary action, otherwise taking this suggestion of his party MP

 Baba Ramdev praised bjp's PM candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi with a line of lawsuits against the Congress government of Uttarakhand
 ramdev ke trust ke upar farji tareeke se jameen kii kharid-farokht ko lekar haridwar ke jiladhikari nidhi mani treepathi kii taraf se 81 mukademe darj kiye gaye hai
 Though complaints and irregularities have been common on Ramdev for many years, but suddenly on Wednesday, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna called a special press conference for the cases against Baba Ramdev, giving information about the case against him
 Somewhere vijay bahuguna ne ramdev ko behad chaalaak or shaatir kehete hue un par ye aarope lagaaya ki unhone haridwar main shantarshah or aurangabad ke kshetra main kai jagah jamine kharidin or galat tareeke se paison kaa len-dein kiya
 Vijay Bahuguna also accused Ramdev of manipulating Rs 10 crore in a big way, along with many more cases were filed in a week
 ramdev ke trust ke upar itani badi taadaad main darj kiye gaye mukademon ko aane vaale loksabhaa chunaavon se agar jodakar dekhen to kahin na kahin bijepi ko ek or mudda mil gaya he
 Ever since the incident at the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, Ramdev had been averse to the eyes of the Congress and he has once again made the Congress government of Uttarakhand his enemy by tying bridges of praise to Narendra Modi
 sachai kya he ye to jaanch ke baad hi pataa chal paaegaa lekin ramdev ke upar museebaton kaa daur kam se kam uttarakhand main to shuru ho hi gaya he
 Legislative assembly elections in five states have started with a tremendous turnout in Punjab and Goa
 ab sabhi kii nazren desh ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh par hai
 The first phase of voting will be held in Uttar Pradesh on February 11, in which voting is to be held in 73 assembly seats in 15 districts including Aligarh, Meerut, Baghpat
 sabhi raajnneetik dal apane star prachaarkon ke dam par apni puri takat jhonk kar votaron ko apni ore aakarshith karne main lage hai
 There are many such seats in the state where it is auspicious for any party to win, so that its government can be formed in the state
 aisi hi ek seat he meerut jile kii hastinapur vidhansabha kshetra, yahaan par bhi pehle charan main hi voting he
 If we look at the electoral history so far, it has happened most of the times that the government of the same party has won the Hastinapur assembly seat in Lucknow
 kya kehete hai aankadendesh main 1952 main pehle chunaav hue lekin tab hastinapur vidhansabha kshetra nahin tha
 But in the elections of 1957, Hastinapur got the status of assembly and it came on the electoral map of the state
 1957, 1962 or 1967 main hastinapur se congress ke pratyaashee ne jeet darj kii to lakhanu main bhi congress kii sarkaar bani or kramash: sampoornanand, chandrabhanu gupta, charan singh mukhyamantri bane
 At the same time, in the elections held in 1969, the candidate of the Bharatiya Kranti Dal won and the Bharatiya Kranti Dal government formed in the state and Chaudhary Charan Singh became the Chief Minister
 jepi andolan kaa bhi asar1974 main congress pratyaashee yahaan se jeeta to congress ke en di tiwari mukhyamantri bane, 1977 main jepi andolan kaa asar yahaan bhi dikhaa or yahaan se janata dal kaa pratyaashee jeeta or lakhanu main janata dal ke ramanaresh yadav mukhyamantri bane
 In 1980, 1985, the Congress repeated its victory and returned to power in the state
 1989 main janata dal kaa vidhayak hastinapur se jeeta to lakhanu main janata dal kii ore se mulaayam singh mukhyamantri bane
 At the same time, Kalyan Singh became the Chief Minister for some time in 1991, but due to the demolition of Babri Masjid, he had to withdraw and till 1993, there was no Presidential rule in the state
 kshetreey dalon kii entry1993 ke baad se rajya main kshetreey partiyon kaa bolbalaa rahaa to 1996 main hastinapur main hue chunaavon main nirdaleey pratyaashee ne jeet darj kii or lakhanu main asthir sarkaar bani, is dauraan mayawati, kalyaan singh,rajnath singh mukhyamantribane to raashtrapati shashan bhi laga
 If the SP candidate won from here in 2002, Mayawati became the Chief Minister with the support of the first SP in the state, but later Mulayam Singh became the Chief Minister
 phir 2007 main basapa or 2012 main sapa pratyaashee ne jeet darj kii to rajya main bhi kramash: inaki hi sarkaar bani
 Samajwadi Party has relied on its sitting MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki for the 2017 elections in Kaun Hai Maidan and former BSP MLA Yogesh Verma is in the fray
 bijepi kii ore se dinesh khatic or ralod ne kusum pradhan ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he
 Why is Hastinapur special? Hastinapur has its own history of Mahabharata, it is also called Mahabharata period Dharrati, so here is the holy place of Jainism, Jambudweep

 In the recently presented budget, the central government has met the demand of the last 60 years to connect Hastinapur with the railway line

 If Dravid batting 'consultant' and Zaheer bowling coach, is Shastri more "team director" again? The poor performance of the Indian football team continued unabated against Iran here on Tuesday and they lost 0–3 in a one-sided match, their third consecutive defeat in a qualifying match for the FIFA World Cup 2018
 iran kii taraf se sardaar ajmun (29wein ), andranik temorian (47wein) or mehadi taremi (51wein minute) ne gol kiye
 The Iranian team easily scored three points without struggling
 isse vah teen maichon main kul saat ank lekar group di main sheersh par pahunch gaya he
 India is ranked fifth and last in the group
 pehle half main kaaphi dhimaa khel hua
 Both teams took time to test each other
 shaareerik rup se majboot iran ke saamne bhartiya captain sunil kshetri ko gol mukh se kuch gaj duuri par gend mili lekan unka shaat goalpost se kaaphi baahar nikal gaya
 Iran scored the first goal in the 29th minute of the game while Sardar Azuman drove a free kick into the goal
 iske baad bhi iran ne aglaa gol karne kii kaaphi koshish kii lekin bhartiya rakshak kisi tarah se bachaav karne main safal rahe
 The score kept Iran in favor of the score 1-0
 duusare half ke shuru main hi iran ne do gol daag die jisase bharat kii haar sunishchit ho gai
 Iran started aggressively in this half which also benefited immediately
 unhone gend ko lagaataar bhartiya baks main rakhaa or aakhir main temorian ne team kaa score 2-0 kiya
 The Indian defense was disintegrated while Iran continued the invasion
 aise main taremi ko baks main gend mili or unhone use gol main daalane main koi galati nahin kii
 The comments vishwa main 155wein number kii team bharat ke liye yah raahat kii baat ho sakati he ki uski rakshapankti ne match ke adhiktar samay main irani farward ko ghere rakhaa or zyada gol nahin hone die
 The Indian team tried their best but there was nothing to threaten Iran
 duusari taraf iran ne kisi tarah kii dhilaai nahin barti
 He kept control of the ball for most of the time and proved why he is finally Asia's best ranked team
 bharat ke paas gol karne kaa sarvshereshth mauka tab aayaa jab jaikichand singh gend lekar aage bade lekin unke cross par jeje kaa header golkeeper ne bachaa diya
 Due to today's defeat, India still have not been able to open their account in the qualifying round
 vah isse pehle oman or guam se haar gaya tha
 India's next match will be against Turkmenistan on 8 October

 NRC ke liye centre sarkaar ne saal 2003 main banaaya tha kanoondoor-tu-door survey kar taiyaar hoga neshnal register of citigensnational register of citigens yani enarasi ke liye sarkaar ko kisi nae kanoon ko banane kii jarurat nahin hai
 Supreme Court Senior Advocate Upamanyu Hazarika said that in 2003, the Central Government created Citizenship (registration of Citizens and Issues of National ID Cards) Rules 2003
 isi niyam ke tahat door-tu-door survey ke jariye enarasi lagu kiya jayega
 Senior advocate Hazarika said that there is no need to enact a separate law to implement NRC
 iske tahat agar kisi kii naagarikta par koi ashanka nahin he to yah maan liya jaataa he ki bharat main rahane vaale log naagarik hai
 However, if there is any kind of apprehension over one's citizenship, it is investigated
 hajarika ne bataaya ki saal 2003 ke niyam ke tahatenarcimen naam chadhvane ke liye kisi khaas dastavej kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 This is because NRC is prepared through door-to-door survey
 edwocket hajarika kaa kahana he ki enarasi ko lekar jahaan tak assam kaa sawaal he to vahaan ghuspaith badi samasya he
 Hence this rule was reformed in the year 2009 and some documents were made necessary to prove citizenship
 aapako bataa den ki naagarikta sanshodhan adhinium or enarasi ko lekar desh ke kai rajyon main hinsak pradarshan ho rahe hai
 The protesters are constantly arson and sabotage

 And it cannot be judged
 'or kahin yah maamla'khud ko mahaan samajhane'kaa to nahin he
 Former BJP leader Ram Jethalmalani is fighting this case on behalf of Kejriwal and without any hesitation asked Jaitley to answer the question why the claim of defamation? On this matter, Arun Jaitley said that he did not say anything about criticism in political life, but this time i had to come to court and file a defamation case, because this time my loyalty and truth were questioned

 He will visit three cities in Myanmar

 Since the 1990s, the two countries have been working together on a number of infrastructure projects

 China can also accuse India of interfering in its strategy here

 # myvalentine # Forever # lovea post shared by Dia Mirza (@diamirzaofficial) on Feb 13, 2017 at 11:42pm PST There has been a continuous tension between India and China in the recent past
 sikkim border ko lekar shuru hua vivaad lagaataar bad rahaa he
 There is also continuous rhetoric from both countries
 ab buudhvaar ko chini videsh mantralay ne bharat par panchasheel samjhauta todane kaa aarope lagaaya he, china kaa kahana he ki bharat ne hi isaki neenv rakhi thi or bharat hi ise tod rahaa he
 Understand what this Panchsheel agreement was 63 years ago, here
 
 
 
 The Panchsheel agreement was signed on 29 April 1954, 63 years ago
 ye samjhauta china ke kshetra tibet or bharat ke bich vyapaar or aapasi sambandhon ko lekar ye samjhauta hua tha
 It had five principles that were the backbone of India's foreign policy for the next five years
 ye samjhauta tatkaaleen pradhanmantrijwahar laal nehruke netritv main hua tha, china ke pehle premier (pradhanmantri) chaauu en laai ke bich hua tha
 Only after this agreement, slogans of hindi-chinese brother-brother were raised and India adopted a non-aligned attitude
 haalanki phir 1962 main china ke saath hue yuddh main is sandhi kii mul bhaavana ko kaafii chot pahunchi thi
 Actually, the term Panchsheel is derived from historical Buddhist inscriptions which are the five prohibitions that determine the behavior of Buddhist monks
 pandit jawahar laal nehru ne vahiin se ye shabd liya tha
 The agreement was held on 31 December 1953 and 29 April 1954, after which it was signed in Beijing
 panchasheel mudde main ye 5 mukhya bindu the ahm1
 Respect each other's integrity and sovereignty2
 paraspar anakraman3
 Not to interfere in each other's internal affairs 4
 samaan or paraspar laabhakaari sambandh5
 Under this peaceful co-existence agreement, India accepted Tibet as a territory of China, thus the treaty at that time removed the tension between India and China to a great extent
 china ne dhamkayisase pehle buudhvaar ko china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne kaha ki bharat ko ek baar phir se sabak sikhaane kaa samay aa gaya he
 This time India will be worse than 1962
 beete dinon bharat raksha mantri arun jetali ke bayaan ke baad chini akhbaar kii itani tikhi tippanee dekhne ko mili he
 Indeed, China had reminded India of the 1962 defeat after tensions over the Sikkim sector, in response to which Defense Minister Jaitley said that since 1962 the situation is different now
 bharat ko 1962 kaa desh samajhane kii bhul nahin kerani chahie
 These cases are based on a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court on 28 July in which Sharif was disqualified
 saath hi court ne sharif or unke parivaar ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke teen maamle tathaa vitt mantri ishak daar ke khilaaf ek maamla darj karne kaa aadesh bhi diya tha
 The political future of Nawaz Sharif, who heads the country's most influential political family and the ruling PML-N party, has been hanging in the balance ever since
 bataa den ki doshi paae jane par unhen jail ho sakati he
 However, Sharif's family alleged that the cases were politically motivated
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Now call it pressure from friends or friends or fond of showing off, but the truth is that about 100 million mobile phone users in India do not give up the temptation to buy new smart mobile phones every year
 jab bhi bazaar main koi nayaa smart phone aata he to aapaki jeb machalane lagati he
 If there is no problem in spending, then you may own more than five phones simultaneously
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki aap apana purana phone bechakar nayaa kharidne kii yojana bana rahe hon
 The question is not how much you want to sell your phone but the real question is how much the shopkeeper is willing to pay you
 bazaar kii chaal ab ulti he
 This market belongs to the buyer and not to the seller
 lihaaja agar aap pehali baar apane puraane phone kaa sauda karne ja rahe hai, to aapke saamne chaunkaane vaali baaten aa sakati hai
 Therefore, we are going to tell you about the truths of the second hand phone market so that you can know the true value of your phone
 aajkal ricel bazaar main capacitive tachascreen, androed oparating system, aplication or achche camere vaale phone kii zyada maang he
 Honey Singh, an old phone dealer in Delhi's Ghaffar Market, says, "there is no longer a demand for Qwerty keypad
 puraane phone kharidne vaale tachaphone maangate hai
 Android based phones are popular and we have a lot of demand for them
 ''lekin agar aapke paas koi desi brands he jise istemaal kar ke aap thak chuke hai, tab kya karenge? mobi phone network privet limited, dilli ke maalik mohit vadhava kehete hai, ''lava or carbon jaise brands kii ricel vailu bade shaharon main zyada nahin he
 These phones are relatively cheap and last less
 lekin chote shaharon, kasbon or gaanvon main inaki maang kaaphi zyada he
 "we tried what we said and got it right
" hamane micromax or lemon ke kuch puraane kvarty keepad or wiphoi vaale phone bechney kii koshish kii
 Most shopkeepers refused to take him on hearing the name, some asked, "is Micromax Bling 2?" Is your Lemon Phone Android Based? ek ne kaha, ''ham aise chote yaa chinis brands main deal nahin karte
 Show it if you have Nokia or Samsung
 ''ant main hamen ek dukandaar mila jisane inkaa daam 800 ru
 Levied (while actual price Rs
 5000 tha)
 Since those phones looked brand new and were working properly, we got their deal for Rs 1,000
 main kar sake
 But one thing has to be kept in mind
 agar phone par scrtch ho yaa uski mul packing or accessories gaayab hon, to yah kooday se behatar nahin
 The entire scenario of the fast emerging mobile handset market has now changed
 yaad kariye jab koi purana phone bechnaa kitna aasaan hua karata tha
 Generally, a popular model of Nokia used to get up to 60 percent of its price while lower brands were also sold at up to 40 percent
 ab yah tarika kaam nahin karata kyonki ab oparating system or nae model kii maang he
 Among all popular platforms, Android and IOS are in high demand in the second-hand market, yet it is limited to certain types of phones
 masalan, samsung gallexi es-2 or gallexi note kaa ricel mulya kahin behatar he
 If you have Apple's iphone 4S or iphone 4, then it will be fun to bargain but the price of HTC Incredible S, Evo 3D, Sony Ericsson Arc s or Xperia will not be available according to your thinking
 ricel market main sabase zyada nuksaan nokia ko hua he
 Previously Nokia was the most in demand, today buyers prefer it at the end
 yadi aapke paas simbian plateform par kaam karne vaala nokia kaa set he, to bazaar main uske maujuuda daam kaa 30 fisadi hi nikal paaegaa
 If that model is now discontinued, you will get 30% of its last price
 bagaiyr kisi scrtch ke nokia i 7 par ab 7,000 ru
 9,000 to Rs
 ke bich hi waapas mil paaenge, jabaki uski aakhri keemat 19,500 ru
 was
 usase kuch lokapriy nokia en8 bhi 8,000 ru
 i am leaving nokia ke windos phone yaa anya brands kii bhi haalat kuch alag nahin he
 Of this, only 50 percent of the current price will be able to come out, even if your phone is ten days or a month old
 yadi body par scrtch hai, to keemat or kam ho jaaegi
 In this case, Research in Motion (RIM), Blackberry is also not popular
 sirf blueberi 8520 se hi aap teen se saadhe teen hajaar tak kii ummid paal sakate hai, vah bhi tab jab aapke paas original bill or dibba ho
 Says Manish of Mahesh Telecom, Mumbai, "second-hand cellphone buyers ask for more features at a lower price
 yahaan tak ki ve samsung gallexi es2 yaa aipal iphone 4 / 4es jaise sabase zyada bikne vaale model kii bhi maang karte hai
 "now you must have realized that it is not easy to charge the old phone
 lekin hamaare nuskhe ko aajamaakar aap apane phone kii behatar keemat vasuul sakate hai
 Union Agriculture Minister and NCP leader Sharad Pawar has raised a new controversy by calling his own government weak
 akhbaar 'indian express' ke mutabik pavaar ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha ki upie kii pichhali sarkaar ke dauraan liye gaye faislon ko lekar maujuuda sarkaar vivaadon main ghiri he
 He said that at such a time, a strong central government was needed, but due to this, the judiciary and other forces rose
 unhone rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee jaisi congress kii mahatvakankshi yojanaon par bhi sawaal uthaae
 Pawar said that after spending huge subsidy on oil and fertilizer and Rs
 40 thousand crore on NREGA, what is left for development
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne upi kii kaman ab mahendra nath pandey ke haathon main saunp di he
 After taking over the command of UP, Pandey had a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 pandey ne kaha ki pradesh par zyada focus karne ke liye mantri pad se istipha diya he

 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that BJP will get 73 plus seats in 2019
 upi bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki 2019 kaa lakshya ham sabake liye behad jaruri he, kyonki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main amit shah kii aguwai sabase zyada sweekaarya he
 He said that our party is such a big party that when do the workers have to work in it
 yah party tay karti he
 Who will be the minister, will not remain, the leadership will decide on the question of resignation of ministers, he said that it is a matter of leadership and what analysis has to be done on this subject, it will decide the supreme leadership
 koun mantri rahegaa, nahin rahegaa, kya kaam karegaa yah party netritv kaa faisla he
 Pandey said that the Prime Minister is a performer himself, so he wants his ministers to perform as well
 har kaaryakarta behatar rigelt de
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that i did not even have the clue to be made the state president
 unhone kaha, 'main chandauli main apane sansadeey kshetra main kaam main laga tha, tabhi mujhe rashtriya adhyaksh kaa nirdesh aayaa ki aap dilli aaie or aane par mujhe yah bataaya gaya ki mujhe pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Uma Bharti and Kalraj Mishra said that Uma Bharti and Kalraj Mishra are our respected leaders
 unka pradesh main ahm yogadan rahaa he
 Kalraj Mishra has always been a blessing to me
 maine kaha ki party tay karti he ki kisko kahaan lagaaya janaa chahie or party ne hi mujhe jimmedaari di he
 He said that the party leadership will decide what role to give to the ministers from whom the organization has been discharged
 yah sab hamaare aadarneey varisht netaa hai, pradesh main jahaan unki upyogita hogi
 They will be used
 'samanvay samvaad ke liye party main janaa chahta hum'pandey ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main ham log sabhi virgon ko saath lekar chalenge
 Yogi Adityanath, Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya will all co-ordinate together
 main party kaa purana netaa or ek purana kaaryakarta hum
 i want to go to the party for coordination and dialogue and definitely i will work with full devotion towards this
 taaki party main sabake bich samanvay ho
 Desire to work for the public, i never lived up to the aspirations
 sanghathan main jab bhi jo jimmedaari di gai, puri lagan se maine puri kii
 Always thought that i will go to the assembly and become the voice of the people
 loksabhaa laduunga or desh kaa vikaas karuunga
 i got this chance iske liye bahut abhaari hum

 congress ke varisht netaa pranab mukherjee kii bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) netaa evam purv kendriya mantri arun shouri ne prashansa karte hue kaha ki vitt mantri behatar pradhanmantriyonmen shumaar ho sakate hai, jiskaa desh ko abhi tak intjaar he

 He is the main pillar of the present government
 lekin mujhe vishwaas he ki vah aaj desh kaa shashan chalaane main bhi sakasham sabit ho sakate hai

 shouri ne kaha, "jab bhi koi samasya aati he to pranab mukherjee ko bulaayaa jaataa he
 So, i believe he can prove to be a better Prime Minister, which we are waiting for
 " For the past few days, you must have been constantly reading the news of the worldwide ransomware attack in Internet, TV and newspapers
 yah kaaphi gambhir he or ab tak lagbhag 150 deshon ke lakhon computer isse prabhavit hai
 Hackers are targeting computers for money
 haalanki ab aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki ab Windows ke nae apadet ke baad isapar lagaam lagaai ja chuki he
 But when we talked to some hackers, they told that it is not easy to rein in it
 yah kisi virus kii tarah failega or ise rokane ke liye sarkari sansthaanon ko havers kii tarah hi sochna padegaa or unhen unheen kii bhasha main jawaab dena hoga
 After this ransomware attack, Windows computers are once again under question
 kyonki aakhir aisa kyon he ki yah atake sirf Windows computer main hua? kyon isse aipal ke computer prabhavit nahin hue?jawaab saaf he
 Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP long ago
 or microsoft ke oparating system sabase zyada pyrated uplabdh hai
 But this is not the case with Apple
 zyaadaatar aipal computers yaa laptop nae varjan se apadated hote hai isliye bhi unamem khatarna nahin hota
 Apart from this, pirated Mac OS is also not found so easily and is also not in practice
 ye sabase aam vajah he jisase aipal ke computer is ranjamvayer atake se kamobesh mahfuj hai
 However, in order to avoid this ransomware, Microsoft released a security update in March itself
 lekin bharat main zyaadaatar customers or santhaan pyrated windos yuj karte hai
 In such a situation, possible security updates are meaningless to them
 itnaa hi nahin jinke paas original windos oparating system bhi he wo bhijyadaatar baar aise apadats ko ignorakarte hai
 Sometimes this is done in negligence, sometimes due to the internet being slow
 kyonki aise apadats ke liye broadband kii jarurat hoti he or bharat main isaki sthiti kisi se chhipi nahin he
 The danger is not averted, but it seems that now the rangmeyer attack is over
 lekin sahi myanon main aisa nahin he
 Because hackers have caught some loopholes through which they can once again carry out large scale cyber attacks
 kya he wannacry ranjamaware or kaise kaam karata he yabritish security research kaa kahana he ki kuch samay ke liye yah ruka he lekin aane vaale samay main yah or bhi badhegaa
 It is also known as Wnaa Decrypt, wannacryptro or WCRY
 yah duusare ranzware kii hi tarah kisi computer ko paise na milane tak block kar saktaa he
 Where does rangware come from? This rangware has come from the flaws of Windows
 reports ke mutabik enese ne ek hekking tul banaaya tha jise kuch havers ne li kar diya jise shadow havers ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 We have discussed the matter with Manan Shah, an ethical hacker from India
 is dauraan unhone ye bataaya he
 Why this ransomware spread so fast, most ransomware is hidden in Word or PDF files that are usually sent by email
 yaa jo computers havers kii jad main hai wo ise torget computers tak pahunchaate hai
 How much loss has happened so far According to an estimate, around 3 lakh computers and 150 countries have been targeted so far
 kya Windows 10 ko bhi isse khatra hanheen, agar aapke paas apadated Windows 10 he to aapako isse koi khatra nahin he
 How You Can Avoid These Attacks According to Microsoft's Malware Protection Center you can protect yourself from these steps Keep up to date anti-virus software like Microsoft Security Essentials and keep it updated
 sunishchit karen kii aapkaa computer apadated hekisi anjaan link ko clic na karen jo aapke email par aayaa heinternet explorer main smart screen on rakhen to jo website se fishing or mailaware se bachaayegaa
 Use pop blocker, as malware also comes as pop up add
