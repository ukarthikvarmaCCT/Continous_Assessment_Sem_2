 saath hi sharad pavaar ne kaha ki agar donon thakare bhai mil jaaen, to maharashtra ke liye behatar hoga
 Now there are speculations whether a new equation can come up in Maharashtra? ncp's 'power house' Sharad Pawar spent his energy in two directions
 pehali bijepi or pradhanmantri ko 'utaarne' main, duusari shivasena ko 'sanvaarane' main
 At the Mumbai election rally, Sharad Pawar targeted Narendra Modi and said that the Prime Minister is an institution, but regretted that Modi is busy in conducting personal attacks while holding this post
 ab ise congress se judaai kaa asar kahie yaa modi ke brands nem kii chintaa ki sharad pavaar ne shivasena kii badi tarif kii
 While remembering the possibility, he remembered Bala Saheb Thackeray and Uddhav also liked the mind
 sharad pavaar ne yah bhi kaha ki donon bhai mil jaaen, to unhen khushi hogi
 He said that his mail will send a good message among others
 sharad pavaar ne shivaji kaa naam bhi liya, lekin gujarat ko 'utaarne' main
 Sharad said, 'why do the leaders of the state where Shivaji has a corrupt text take Shivaji's name?' uttar pradesh ke barabanki jile main paisa jamaa karaane bank main gai ek mahila ko 50 hajaar kii chapat lag gai
 The woman was lying in line outside the bank
 isi dauraan mahila ke peeche hi khadi ek duusari mahila ne uske shaatiranaa andaaj main uske purse se 50 hajaar rupee nikaal liye or maukey chanpat ho gai
 In Barabanki, LI was engaged to deposit money outside SBI Bank
 gita naamak mahila bhi cash jamaa karaane ke liye line main lagi thi
 During this time, a woman standing behind Geeta started talking to him and on the pretext, the woman cut off the Geeta and took out 50 thousand rupees
 gita jab counter par cash jamaa karne ke liye pahunchi or usne purse kholaa to uskaa purse cat chukaa tha
 50 thousand rupees kept in it were also missing
 purse khaali dekhakar us mahila ke hosh ud gaye
 Geeta complained about the case to the bank manager and the police
 shikaayat ke baad bank kaa sisitivi footage khangala gaya
 In which another lady was seen cutting Gita's purse
 ghatana ke baad gita ne kotwali pahunch kar is sambandh main maamla darj kara diya he
 Now the police is searching for the accused woman based on CCTV footage
 'phukare' kahani he, chaar ladakon kii jinaki jeben khaali hai or jo dilli ke college main admician ke liye paise kaa jugad karne nikal padate hai
 You will be seen in the role of four Fukars, Honey (pulkit Samrat), Chucha (varun), Zafar (ali Fazal) and Lalli (manjot Singh)
 paise kaa jugad karne ke liye ye funs jate hai, richa chaddha ke jaal main or phir ye chaaron usase kaise nikalate hai, yah aap film dekhakar hi jaan paaenge
 First thing is the shortcomings of the film, revolving around Delhi in this film takes a lot of time to introduce the four characters to the audience, although this does not reduce the entertainment, but the story gets less grip
 tippaniyan Honey and Chucha, the two characters of the film, are blatant throughout the film, but they may have been lacking in detailing their characters, such as who their family is, where their home is
 
 
 unki karstaniyon par unka parivaar kuch kyon nahin kahata
 Apart from this, the third character Ali Fazal was not threaded properly in the story
 yah kirdaar rahasyamay-sa lagata he
 Well, now for the merits, all the actors in the film have done a good job, especially Varun
 inke alaava kuch chote rolls vaale kalakaaron ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 The camera looks amazing in the film
 film aapako hansane par majaboor kar sakati he
 Overall a tight screen play and good direction from Mrigdeep Singh Lamba makes the film better
 iske kuch gane bhi achche hai
 3 from my side to the film
 5 stars
 They are trapped in the trap of money, they will get into the trap of Richa Chadha and then how will these four get out of it, you will only know by watching the film

 5 stars bollywood ke varisht abhinayta manoj kumaar ko varsh 2015 ke liye dada sahab phalke puraskaar diya jayega
 The award is given by the Government of India for significant contribution to the film world

 Based on his films, he is known as 'bharat Kumar'
 manoj kumaar ko unke abhinay kii khaas style or samvaad adaayagi ke liye bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 In Bollywood in the 70s, Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha gave blockbuster movies more than one
 lekin unki blockbster filmon kaa ‘silsilaa’ ek baar thama to phir dobaaraa donon ko screen par ek saath dekhne ke liye darshak taras hi gaye
 Although in some films like 'om Shanti Om' and 'surma Bhopali', both of them appeared in a film, but in different frames
 haalanki is babat prashansakon kii 30 saal se bhi zyada puraani ichha ab jald puri hone vaali he
 It is reported that after a long time, the two are going to be seen together in the film 'shamitabh'
 haalanki abhi tak yah saaf nahin he ki donon film main ek frem main najar aaenge yaa nahin
 But fans are happy with the arrival of both of them in 'shamitabh' and are hoping that the chemistry of both will be seen once again
 LOOK whom I'm sharing screen space with in shamitabh

 — rafnvir_ darrhoraeey_ (@ranvirshorey)may 16, 2014 The 19-page proposal made by former India head coach Anil Kumble to the BCCI regarding restructuring of contracts was the highest priority for salaries and demanded that the head coach's earnings should be 60 per cent of the captain's projected earnings
 
 pitiai ko kumble ke is prastutikaran kii prati mili he, jo unhone 21 may ko ipel final ke dauraan prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ko saunpa tha
 In the 12th page of this document titled Salaries and Contract Restructuring of the people associated with the Indian cricket team, Kumble has proposed an increase in the salary of the support staff
 ipel se rashtriya kochon kii kamai kaa samarthan kiyadastavej main saath hi ipel se rashtriya kochon kii kamai kaa samarthan kiya gaya tha, jisase ki unki aay main ijapha hoga
 But he did not clarify whether it was a conflict of interest or not
 kumble ne saath hi suzav diya tha ki khilaadiyon ke kendriya anubandh kaa 20 pratishat hissaa vairieble pe hona chahie jo unke fitness str par aadhaarit ho
 The former Indian captain has given a four-column chart under point number-10 'the Sustained Change: Enablers'
 kumble ne aneblers shabd kaa istemaal sahyogi staff ke liye kiya he
 Kumble suggested increasing the current salary of six and a half crores to seven and a half crores and wrote in the comments column - 60 per cent of the captain's projected income is eligible for a variable bonus of 30 per cent of his salary based on the team's performance
 kamai main ijapha ek june 2016 se lagu hopurv coach kaa yah prastaav sanket tha ki jab bhi kohli ko bisisiai se adhik kamai hogi, tab anupaat ke aadhaar par unka vetan bhi badhegaa
 The chart suggested that Sanjay Bangar's salary be increased from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2
5 crore, while r Sridhar received Rs 1 crore 75 lakh in place of the current one crore and this increase will be effective from June 1, 2016
 kumble ke in sujhaavon main haalanki jisane bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon kaa dhyaan khinchaa vah rashtriya kochon kii ipel se aay kaa suzav he
 Significantly, former COA member Ramachandra Guha had raised the issue of national coaches earning from the IPL while separating from the group and termed it a clear issue of conflict of interest
 kai logon ne ise guha kaa rahul dravid par nishaanaa mana tha, jo bharat-e or under 19 team coach hone ke alaava ipel kii dilli frenchiji dairedevills ke saath bhi yahi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 a BCCI official had said the issues are relevant
 Hankumble wrote in the ninth point of the 11th page in the guidelines for enablers, "players are kept out of contract during two months of the IPL window
 isi tarah kochon ko bhi anubandh se baahar rakhane kii jarurat he jisase ki vah ipel kaa hissaa ban saken isse unki aay main ijapha ho sakegaa or unhen adhik anubhav milegaa, visheshkar tii20 maichon main
 a BCCI official studying Kumble's proposal said the issues were relevant, but his proposal on the IPL was contrary to what Guha had written in his letter
 agar ham guha ke likhe mutabik chalate hai to anil ne jo maang kii he vah hiton ke takaraav kaa spasht maamla he
 Our Sequamahon of Goods and Services Tax should have ended when the government decided to introduce a three-tier GST
 dakiyanoosee jiesti model kanoon dekhne ke baad jiesti ko lekar utsaah ko niyantrit karne kaa doosraa mauka aayaa tha
 After Parliament's approval of the loose constitution amendment bill, the expectations about GST should have been rationalized
 lekin jiesti ke jatil or samvedansheel sudhaar ko lekar romantic hona baari pad rahaa he
 Within three months of the Parliament's approval, there is a need to save the GST which we consider to be India's greatest reform
 sansad se nikalne ke baad jiesti main vahi khot pawast hone lage hai jinase bachaane ke liye jiesti ko gadha ja rahaa tha
 Doubt was raised only after the second meeting of the GST Council, because in this meeting, the council decided the rules of registration and return in GST without taking the opinion of the taxpayers, which are on the lines of the old draft law and would be a problem for taxpayers
 pichley saptaah council kii teesri baithak ke baad ashankaon kaa jinn bottle se baahar aa gaya
 There was a fear from day one of the imposition of a very high tax structure in GST
 council kii taaja baithak main aashay kaa prastaav charchaa ke liye aayaa he
 The central government also wants to levy cess on the GST, which is never expected in the modern tax structure like GST
 council kii teen baithkon ke baad jiesti kaa jo praaroop ubhar rahaa he vah ummiido ko nahin, balki ashankaon ko badhaane vaala haih centre sarkaar ne jiesti council kii baithak main guds and services tex ke liye chaar daron kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 These rates will be 6, 12,18 and 26 percent
 sone ke liye chaar fisadi kii dar alag se hogi
 That is, the total five rates structure is in front
  maujuuda vyavastha main aam khapat ke bahut se saamaan va utpaada waite yaa exise duty se mukt hai
 Some products attract 3, 5 and 9 percent VAT while some have 6 percent excise duty
 jiesti kar pranali ke tahat 3 se 9 fisadi waite or 6 fisadi exise vaale sabhi utpaada 6 fisadi kii pehali jiesti dar ke antargat honge
 The system of zero duty goods may not exist, so this rate of tax may be inclined towards increasing inflation
  centre sarkaar ne jiesti ke do standard rate prastaavit kiye hai
 It is unique and unexpected
 jiesti kii puure desh main ek dar kii ukvamid thi
 Four rates are being kept here, of which two will be standard rates
 baarah fisadi ke tahat kuch jaruri saamaan rakhe ja sakate hai
 This is the new peak of complication in GST
  yah maanane main koi harj nahin he ki zyaadaatar utpaada or sevaayen 18 fisad dar ke antargat hongi kyonki antarrashtriya vyavastha ke mutabik jiesti main guds or services ke liye ek samaan dar kii pranali he
 Under this arrangement, the tax rate on services will increase from the present 15 per cent (including cess) to 18 per cent
 yani in daron ke is str par jiesti khaasaa mahangaa pad saktaa he
  The fourth rate is 26 per cent, which will be on tobacco, expensive cars, aerated drinks, luxury goods
 aishwarya par lagane vaale is kar ko sin tex kaha ja rahaa he
 Rates on many products in this category are above 26 per cent, while some are slightly below this level
 is dar ke tahat upabhokta keemton par asar kamobesh simit rahegaa
 है It is difficult to understand that only 4% tax on gold is for the benefit of the poor
 is samay par sone par keval ek fisadi kaa waite or jewelri par ek fisadi exise he, jise badhaakar kam se kam se 6 fisadi kiya ja saktaa tha
  Nobody expected the government to introduce GST, advocating a transparent tax structure, and would propose to levy a cess on the backdoor GST rate (26 per cent)
 ses na keval apaardarshee hai balki kooparative federlism ke khilaaf hai kyonki rajyon ko inamen hissaa nahin miltaa he
 The Central Government wants to mobilize resources to offset the loss of GST to the states through cess
 alabatta rajya yah chahenge ki jiesti kii peak rate 30 se 35 fisadi kar di jaae, jisamen unhen zyada sansaadhan milenge
 The same cess derailed the last meeting of the GST Council and no decision could be taken
 agar jiesti 4 yaa 5 kar daron ke dhaanche or ses ke saath aata he to yah input tex credit ko buree tarah pechida bana degaa jo ki jiesti system kii jaan he
 In this arrangement, the tax paid on raw material or service during production or supply is refunded
 yahi vyavastha ek utpaadan yaa seva par baar-baar tex kaa asar khatm karti he or mahangaai rokatii he
 The central government is in a hurry over GST
 jiesti se desh kii surat or sirat badal jane ke prachaar main iske praavdhaanon par vichaar vimarsh or taiyaari khet rahi he
 Businessmen, entrepreneurs, consumers, tax administration are out of the process of compiling GST
 jiesti council kii baithak main maujuud rajyon ke mantri iske praavdhaanon par khulkar sawaal nahin uthaa rahe hai yaa phir unke sawaal shant kar die gaye hai
 Looking at the three meetings of the GST Council, it seems as if this reform has been confined only to the revenue concerns of the Center and the states
 karadaataaon ke liye kai panjikaran or kai ritern bharne ke niyam pehle hi manjuur ho chuke hai
 Now it is the turn of many tax rates that will make GST like the old VAT filled with imperfections
 guds and services tex kaarobaari sahajata kii redh maarane, kar niyamon ke paalan kii laagat (compliance cost) badhaane or mahangaai ko nae daant dene kii disha main teji se aage bad rahaa he
 Will we be able to save GST or will we be buried under the burden of this reform? papa fardin khan in dinon apane ghar aae nanhe mehmaan kaa swaagat karne main biji hai

 jab se ye khabar ai he kifardin bete ke papaabane hai, tab se unke is nanhe rajkumaar ko dekhne ke liye sabhi betaab hai

 chunaav main buree haar ke baad loksabhaa ke andar netaa pratipaksh koun hoga is par charchaa chal rahi he
 In the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on Saturday, Sonia Gandhi has been authorized to make her decision on the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha
 haalanki, dilachasp baat ye he ki congress party ab netaa pratipaksh kaa daawa loksabhaa main nahin karegi
 Congress's media in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala told the press conference that we do not have sufficient number of mps
 unhone kaha ki aadhikarik taur par 10 fisadi saansad kii jarurat hoti he or hamaare paas 2 saansadon kii kami he, aise main hamaare paas netaa pratipaksh nahin ho saktaa he or jab tak hamaare paas 54 saansad nahin honge, ham is post kii maang nahin karenge
 Before this issue, Surjewala surrounded the Modi government on inflation
 surajevaala ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne bina sabsidi vaale gas silendar ke bhav 25 rupee badha die hai or sabsidi vaale silendar kii keemat 1
 23 has been increased by Rs
 unhone kaha ki lagaataar chauthe maheene rasoi gas ke daam bade hai
 Surejawala said that on 16 May 2014, the subsidized cylinder used to be available in Delhi for Rs 412, now its price was Rs 497
 37 paise ho gaya he
 If a family buys 12 cylinders in a year, then the increase of more than one thousand falls on it
 iskaa sabase zyada asar ujjwala yojana ke tahat silendar kharidne vaali bahanon par padegaa
 Apart from this, Surjewala said that on 16 May 2014, the cylinder without subsidy was available in Delhi for Rs 414, now 737
 50 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Surjewala said that PM Modi had appealed to give up subsidy in the first term
 us samay silendar kaa daam 323
 50 rupees, now it has increased to 737
 50 rupee ho gaya he
 In such a situation, is it not an injustice to the 125 crore families who have left the subsidy
 surajevaala ne kaha ki hamaari maang he is badhotaree ko waapas liya jaae
 On the US decision to abolish GSP status, Randeep Surjewala said that this is a danger bell
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko special trade states 24 november 1975 ko mila tha, jab indira gandhi pradhanmantri thi or 44 saal baad 5 june se yah waapas liya ja rahaa he
 India used to export the most to the US, so this decision is going to affect 16% of exports
 surajevaala ne kaha ki ek taraf berogari charam par he
 GDP is at the bottom of five years
 aise main agar bharat kaa niryaat prabhavit hoga to swaabhaavik taur par naukariyaan prabhavit hongi
 At the behest of America, India stopped buying oil from Iran, on the other hand America withdrew special status

 barad ne is baar sonia, rahul ko hameshaa ghere rakhane vaali mandali par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He has said that these big leaders of Congress treat ordinary workers worse than stray dogs
 punjab ke purv saansad barad ne kaha, ‘saal dar saal, ye kuch bade vyakti hai jo aam kaaryakartaaon se aawaara kutton se bhi bura vyavhaar karte aa rahe hai
 He said, 'they have built a big wall between the general workers and the Congress leadership
 ye wo netaa hai jinhen har vakt tom ford or kanali suut pahane puunjipatiyon ke saath dekha ja saktaa he
 Brar's disputed statement on Sonia and Rahul had earlier blamed the defeat of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in the Lok Sabha elections, saying that if they take two years' leave, then there is' no harm '
 barad kaa kahana tha ki congress ke sabase kharaab haar ke baad sabhi mahasachivon ko istipha de dena chahie or party kii kaman naye netaaon ko saunp deni chahie
 He had said, 'this is a collective responsibility
 main nahin kah rahaa hum ki keval sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi par jimmedaari daal di jaae
 Everyone has to take responsibility
 ve bhi jimmedaar hai
 What i am saying is that if a person has been the party president for so many years, then there is no harm in taking leave of two years

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kafile main kareeb 500 surakshakarmi chalate hai
 But after a scathing reply from a Delhi Police constable, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) was forced to reconsider the need for such a large convoy
 ab piemo ne dilli police se kafile main apane javaanon kii sankhya ghataane ko kaha he
 Actually, on 2 October, the Prime Minister went out to launch the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 is dauraan unhone mandir maarg thane main pulicekarmiyon se poocha ki vah apane kaam karne kii jagah ko saaf kyon nahin rakhte?consteble ram kumaar (badla hua naam) ke munhfat lekin spasht jawaab ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 He told the Prime Minister that the police stations are not able to be cleaned because most of the policemen are busy in the work of security route and they do not get time to do anything other than this
 PMO ne jari kiye nae nirdeshram kumaar ke is jawaab ke baad thodi hi der main modi rajghat ravaanaa ho gaye
 Later when the PMO talked to Delhi Police about this, it was found that more than 50 policemen were deployed at a barricade at a place like Tis Jan Marg
 vah bhi us sthiti main jab udhar aane vaale trephic ko roak diya gaya tha
 Then what was there
 agle hi din piemo ne suraksha intjaamon ke sambandh main nae nirdesh jari kar die
 On the condition of anonymity, a senior police officer said, 'on October 3, new guidelines came from the PMO
 isamen kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri kii suraksha main jarurat bhar ke javaanon kii hi duty lagaai jaae
 This does not require the siege of the entire city
 'ab police mukhyalayon main viipi rooton par javaanon kii tainaati main katautee karne kii charchaaen hai
 Police officers are now working in this direction that with the passing of the Prime Minister's convoy, the common people have to face little trouble
 yah nae nirdesh aise samay main aae hai jab pradhanmantri haal hi main america yatra se laute hai
 Significantly, in the US, the president is often seen mingling with the common people without security arrangements

 After the close look between Pilot and Rahul Gandhi, it is common discussion among Congress workers that now Sachin Pilot will be the face of Congress in the elections
 is baat par bhi logon kaa bharosa he ki agar congress satta main aati he sachin payalat mukhyamantri banenge

 It is noteworthy that this event in Jaipur was an election conclave for the Congress
 rahul ne gahalot-payalat ko milwaaya galishok gahalot dilli main congress ke mahasachiv ban chuke hai lekin phir bhi kehete rahete hai ki main rajasthan se dur nahin hum

 So, he was seen making a balance on the stage
 jab sabha kii shuruyaat hui to ek taraf sachin payalat ko baithaaya to duusari taraf ashok gahalot ko baithaaya or ant main donon ko gale milwaaya
 Gehlot will continue to do good work for the party, let us know that Ashok Gehlot has been the President of the State Congress twice and the Chief Minister twice
 aise main party par unki pakad he lekin sachin payalat ke saade chaar saal ke congress ke adhyaksh rahane ke dauraan jis tarah se party ne bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf sangharsh kiya he payalat ko uskaa phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has said that the struggle in the party will bear fruit
 ishaare-ishaare main gahalot ne kah diya ki unhen mukhyamantri nahin banaaya jaataa he to party ke liye kaam karte rahenge

 The indomitable enthusiasm with which he solved the initial difficulties of the newborn Republic, he made an indelible place in the political map of the world

 Merger of princely states After becoming Home Minister, he was entrusted with the responsibility of merging Indian princely states
 unhone apane dayitvon kaa nirvahan karte hue chah sau choti-badi riyasaton kaa bharat main vilay karaayaa
 The merger of princely states was the first achievement of independent India and Patel undeniably contributed to it
 swatantra bharat ke pehle teen saal sardaar patel desh ke up-pradhanmantri, grahamantri, soochna prasaaran mantri rahe
 Patel merged those princely states into the Indian Union, which were sovereign in themselves

 iske parinamswaroop teen riyaasaten- hyderabad, kashmir or junagarh ko chhodkar shesh sabhi rajvaadon ne swechha se bharat main vilay kaa prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 The unification of 562 princely states by August 15, 1947, except Hyderabad, Kashmir and Junagadh, the remaining Indian princely states had joined the Union of India, which was a major achievement in Indian history
 junagarh ke nawab ke viruddh jab vahaan kii praja ne vidroh kar diya to vah bhagkar pakistan chalaa gaya or is prakaar junagarh ko bhi bharat main mila liya gaya
 When the Nizam of Hyderabad rejected the proposal for merger with India, Sardar Patel sent the army there and surrendered the Nizam
 nihsandeh sardaar patel dwaara yah 562 riyasaton kaa ekikaran vishwa itihaas kaa ek aashcharya tha
 If you want to see Patel, it will cost money
 
 
 ye hai tikat retlakshyadweep samooh main bhi thi ahm bhoomikalakshadweep samooh ko bharat main milaane main bhi patel kii mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 The people of this region were cut off from the mainstream of the country and they came to know about India's independence several days after August 15, 1947
 haalanki yah kshetra pakistan ke najadik nahin tha, lekin patel ko lagata tha ki is par pakistan daawa kar saktaa he
 Therefore, to avoid any such situation, Patel sent an Indian Navy ship to hoist the national flag in Lakshadweep
 iske kuch ghante baad hi pakistani nausena ke jahaaj lakshadweep ke paas mandaraate dekhe gaye, lekin vahaan bharat kaa jhanda laharaate dekh unhen waapas lautnaa padaa

 The Supreme Court of India has attached the application of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to rebuild the Ram temple in Ayodhya with the main case
 adaalat ne kaha ki is mudde ko lekar supreme court main hi civil yachika par sunwaayee lambit he
 In such a case, this petition cannot be heard
 bataa den ki bijepi netaa swami ne is ore nai yachika daayar kar kaha tha kiraam mandir kaa purnirmaanusi jagah kiya jaae, jahaan ram kaa janm hua tha
 In the year 1994, the Center had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court and said that if it is proved that the temple was here, then it will build the temple
 jabaki ASI ne kaha he ki ram mandir ke avshesh mili hai
 The affidavit of the Narasimha Rao government cites that after the court's stand, Abaswamy's plea will be heard along with the appeal filed against the order of the Allahabad High Court
 supreme court ne yah bhi saaf kiya swami is maamle main daakhil kii gai apilon kii sunwaayee ke dauraan hi apni baat rakhen
 Swamy, in his petition, citing the 1994 Narasimha Rao government's affidavit, demanded the construction of a Ram temple
 'masjidon ko shift kiya jaataa rahaa he'subramanyam swami ne somvaar ko ayodhya main vivaadit sthal par ram mandir nirmaan ke sambandh main CJI kii adhyakshata vaali bench ke saamne yachika darj kii he
 It states that mosques have been shifted in many Islamic countries on public issues such as road construction, but the temples are not removed once built
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki ayodhya main vivaadit dhaanche ko sarayu nadi ke paas se kahin or shift nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On this, the Supreme Court has said that only the bench hearing the other matters related to the Ram mandir-babri Masjid dispute will hear this matter as well
 '
 
 
 Then the land will be handed over to the Hindus 'it is worth mentioning that in 1994 Narasimha Rao's government had given affidavit in the Supreme Court,' If it is proved that there was a temple at the disputed place, then the land will be handed over to the Hindus
 ' swami kaa kahana he ki archelogical survey of india kii taraf se kii gai khudaai main yah sabit ho chukaa he ki babari masjid hindu mandir ko todakar banaai gai thi
 Swamy has said that the Ram temple cannot be built anywhere else, as it is a matter related to the tradition and faith of Hindus

 The house is small or big, it looks good only when it is completely clean and tidy
 ghar main kisi bhi prakaar kii gandagi swasthya ke liye hanikaarak hoti he
 If there are children or asthma patients in the house, then it is necessary to keep the house clean
 ghar kii safai ko lekar mana jaataa he ki jis ghar main gandagi hoti he vahaan paison kii killat rahati he
 So our elders always instruct us to keep the house clean
 vaise to safai sabhi kar lete hai lekin safai ke dauraan kuch aisi galtiyaa karaten hai jisase ghar puri tarah se saaf naa hone kii vajah se sehat par bura asar daalata he
 So while cleaning the house, keep these things in mind
 1
 Non-vacuuming after dusting: Often people are satisfied only by dusting while cleaning
 unhen lagata he ki unka ghar saaf ho chukaa he
 But please tell that after dusting your house must be cleaned with Kovacume cleaner
 kyonki dusting karne se dhul mitti floor par hi rah jaati he
 Due to which many types of diseases can engulf you
 american college of allergy, asthma and immunology ke anusaar dust se allergy hoti jisamen khujali, chhinke, khaansee hone ke saath asthma kaa atake bhi aa saktaa he
 2
 fafundi par dhyaan na dena:fafundi kai prakaar kii hoti hai
 According to experts, it is important to keep many things in mind while cleaning mold
 neshnal public health institute ke anusaar fafundi ke kaaran log asthma ke shikaar bhi ho sakate hai
 Experts say that mildew should be cleaned with detergent with hot water
 fafundi ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye saaf karne ke baad disimphected jarur daalen
 3
 kichan ke samaan ko saaf karnaa na bhoolen:aam taur par log safai to kar leten hai lekin yah bhul jate hai ki aap jis cheez se safai kar rahe hai wo kitna saaf he
 With the cleaning of the house, you should keep changing the dusting clothes on time, always wash and dry the wipes, clean your microwaves daily by wetting them with a clean cloth, wash the sink periodically with mild warm water
 
 taaki bacteria aapaki sehat ko nuksaan na pahunchaa saken
 4
 jaldbaaji main safai karnaa:aajkal bhaag daud bhare jivan main samay naa hone kii vajah se log har kaam jaldi-jaldi karnaa chaahante hai
 But cleaning the house in a hurry can be dangerous for you
 kyonki jarmas or bacteria ko puri tarah se saaf karne ke liye sabhisenitizer or disimphectedco kam se kam 60 senkend se 10 minute tak chhodana jaruri hota he
 Because washing sprays germs
 5
 Washing the window during sunlight: It is often seen that people wash the windows of the house in the sun
 lekin export kii maane to khidakiyon ko dhoop main dhone ke bajaae shaam ke samay hi dhonaa chahie
 Because the sun dries the water quickly
 jis vajah se shishe par dhaariyaan pad jaati hai

 His father Sachin Tendulkar may be cricket's biggest superstar, but Arjun Tendulkar wants to make his own identity
 arjuna ke mahaan banane kii khwaahish main diggaj pakistani cricketer wasim akram kii choti si madad bhi unke liye bahut kaam aegi
 Akram spent some time with Arjun Tendulkar in the past and he praised Arjun's love for cricket and hoped that his future would be very bright
 akram ne enditivi se kaha ki haal hi main mumbai main hui mulaakaat main arjuna baayen haath se swing gendbaaji ke bare main jaananaa chaahate the

 karnataka main sirf ek vyakti kii sarkaar hone par congress mukhar he
 Even after 18 days, Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa could not set up his Council of Ministers
 congress ne samvidhan kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki rajyapal mantriparishad ke paraamarsh par kaam karte hai to phir 18 dinon se kaise bina mantriparishad ke sarkaar chal rahi he
 On behalf of the Congress, party spokesperson VS Ugrappa also questioned the silence of the Governor and asked whether the government is running according to the rules of the Constitution in the state? How can a chief minister be called a government? The Congress spokesperson said that the governor should sack the government taking this issue into consideration
 phir dilli aane kii taiyaari main yediurppamantriyon kii suchi final karne ke liye beete saat agast ko dilli pahunche bies yediurppa ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah yah kahkar lautaa chuke hai ki abhi baadh raahat evam punarvaas par dhyaan den
 Public safety is more important than the Council of Ministers
 ab sutara bataa rahe hai ki 15 agast ke baad 16 agast ko bies yediurppa bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se bhent karne ke liye dilli aa sakate hai
 Since the numbers are in favor of BJP after the fall of JD (S) -congress government in Karnataka, the ground is not very strong
 aise main yediurppa chaahate hai ki sabhi samikarnon ko dhyaan main rahakar hi vah mantriparishad gathit karen
 So that there is no resentment about the Council of Ministers
 is naate vah kendriya netritv se is masale par paraamarsh ke baad hi apane str se mantriyon kii suchi final karnaa chaahate hai
 When Yeddyurappa was sworn in when the JD (S) -congress coalition government fell
 kai dinon kii uthapatak ke baad bijepi ne sarkaar banaai
 On 26 July BS Yeddyurappa was sworn in as the Chief Minister
 unke saath kisi bhi mantri ne shapath nahin lee thi
 Because so far BS Yeddyurappa has not prepared a list of ministers after consulting with the top leadership of BJP

 Rebel candidates from BJP are contesting elections in a dozen places in Delhi and rebels from Aam Aadmi Party in more than ten places
 pichhali baar dilli vidhansabha chunaav main aam aadmi party or bijepi ke bich mahaj paanch fisadi voton ke antar ne raajnneetik paridrishy badalakar rakh diya tha
 If rebel candidates breach the traditional vote bank of these two parties, then it can have a direct impact on 10 seats
 nagloi jat vidhansabha jo bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa he pichley baar bijepi ke manoj shaukeen ne yahaan se jeet darj kii thi
 Here Bijender Shaukeen of Aam Aadmi Party was a councilor from BJP, this time he switched sides
 saath hi narendra bindal jo 30 saal bijepi main rahakar is baar gilaas chunaav chinh se nirdaleey chunaav ladakar bijepi ke pratyaashee ko pani pilaa rahe hai
 Narendra Bindal says that the BJP created a bogey for Arvind Kejriwal and gave tickets to the people who had defected from the Aam Aadmi Party
 jabaki saalon se kaaryakarta ke rup main lage logon kii andekhi ho rahi he
 That's why i have made up my mind to contest elections, i have the support of BJP and Sangh pracharaks
 ye mushkil sirf bijepi ke saath hi nahin he aam aadmi party ke saath bhi he
 Ambedkar Nagar has the least number of candidates in the Delhi Assembly elections
 yahaan sirf 4 pratyaashee chunaav lard rahe hai
 Three of them belong to the Aam Aadmi Party
 pichhali baar aap party ke tikat se chunaav jite ashok chouhan ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 At the same time, Rajbir Singh is contesting from the BSP ticket unhappy over not getting the ticket
 choudhary prem singh ko chhodkar baakiyon kaa taalluk aap party se hi he
 Rajbir Singh says that i was a loyal worker of the Aam Aadmi Party, but AAP party is fighting Ajay Dutt from here for money
 isi ke chalate maine bispi se chunaav ladane kaa man banaaya he
 This time the AAP party is contesting elections by giving tickets to many leaders of other parties, while the BJP cadre base parties have also fielded Aam Aadmi Party leaders like Vinod Kumar Binny and Dhir
 yahi vajah he ki donon hi partiyon main kaaryakartaaon ke bich khaasaa asantosh he

 BJP has taken up the matter of eating chicken before going to Rahul Gandhi's temple
 rajya ke bijepi pramukh or siem pad ke ummidavaar bies yediurppa ne is maamle main ek twit bhi kiya
 Yeddyurappa said on Tuesday that Rahul Gandhi had eaten 'javari Chicken' before going to the temple
 unhone likhaa tha, 'ek ore 10 percent siem siddharmaiya fish khaane ke baad manjunath dharmashala gaye or duusari ore hindu rahul gandhi javari chikan khaane ke baad narsimha swami ke darshan karne gaye the

 Yeddyurappa (@BSYBJP) February 12, 2018 The case also received a lot of attention on social media
 logon ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne mandir kaa apmaan kiya he
 However, this entire story is based on speculation
 ho saktaa he ki yah sach bhi na ho
 According to India Today Group reporter Nagarjuna Dwarkanath, the news was broken by a local reporter who did not see Rahul Gandhi eating chicken
 sthaneey reporter ne nagarjun ko bataaya ki unhone espiji ko khaane ke packet le jate hue dekha tha
 The local reporter asked the SPG what is in this packet, so he said - fish and chicken
 iske baad sthaneey reporter is nattejey par pahunch gaya ki rahul ne mandir jane se pehle chikan khaaya
 This story of Rahul Gandhi eating chicken and visiting a temple started because of a regional reporter
 This is what he told me
 Regional Reporter: i saw SPG carrying food, asked them what's in it
 SPG: Chicken and fishrr: good story
 RG eats meat before temple visit
 1 / n— Nagarjun Dwarakanath (@nagarjund)february 14, 2018india today ke reporter nagarjun ne jab sthaneey reporter se poocha ki tumhen kaise pataa ki chikan or fish rahul ne hi khaaya hoga
 On this, the reporter said that if he had not eaten, then Rahul should clarify the matter
 Me to RR : how do you know RG ate meat? Maybe he looked at the food & said no i don’t want this
 Gimme Bread butter
 RR: I’ll run whatever i want
 It's up to RG to give clarificationme (shocked): how's this journalism
 You can’t run false newsrr: there’s no journalism today— Nagarjun Dwarakanath (@nagarjund)february 14, 2018is par nagarjun ne poocha ki kya yahi patrakarita he to sthaneey reporter kaa jawaab tha ki aajkal koun patrakarita karata he
 The BJP then started broadcasting and publicizing the news that Rahul had eaten chicken before going to the temple
 nagarjun ne bataaya he kiraahul gandhi is rajya ke daureke dauraan sarkari guest house main hi ruke the or unhone khaanaa bhi yaheen khaaya tha
 No one was allowed to enter this guest house, so no one saw Rahul eating chicken

 Sitting on foreign soil, Rahul not only laid siege to the current central government and BJP, but now he is also seen playing in the 'attacking mode' in the election summer
 isse bhi badi baat ye ki rahul ab sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi par waar kar rahe hai
 Recently, Rahul Gandhi in his tweets took a dig at PM Modi
 mudda chaahe jo ho rahul ne modi ko hi nishane par liya
 In the last one week, Rahul has made several direct attacks on PM Modi and that too in the style of rhyme and rhyme
 aaj hogi jumalon kii barishasomvaar ko modi gujarat gaurav yatra ke samaapan samaaroh main shaamil hone ahmedabad pahunche bhi nahin the ki rahul ne twit kar daalaa
 In his tweet, Rahul wrote, 'weather conditions, before the election, there will be rain of jumal in Gujarat today' yani piem modi jab tak gujarat pahunchakar bhaashan de pate, usase pehle hi rahul ne unke bayanon ko jumalebaji kii sangya de daali or ek nai bahes ko janm de diya
 On October 15, Rahul also took a jibe at PM Modi through a tweet 
 darasal, ek amareeki-canadai danpati hakkaani network ke changul se aaazaad karaayaa gaya tha, jis par america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne twit kiya tha
 Trump described Pakistan's move as the beginning of new relations
 trump pakistan se khush najar aae to rahul ne phir piem modi ko gher liya
 Rahul wrote, 'modiji, hurry up, Trump wants to be embraced once again'
 Modi ji quick; looks like President Trump needs another hugpic

 When the situation of India's condition worsened in the Global Hunger Index, Rahul also took a dig at it
 rahul ne baqayada hindi kavi dushyant kumaar kii panktiyon se sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Rahul wrote, 'if you have hunger, be patient, if not bread, then what is the issue in Delhi nowadays
 chand par le jaaenge modiisase pehle jab rahul gujarat main chunaav prachaar kar rahe the, tab bhi unhone apane nae rup kaa namoona dikhaaya
 In public meetings, Rahul Modi was criticizing the government and the BJP, but also took a strong toll on Twitter
 rahul ne us dauraan likhaa, '2028 main modiji gujarat ke har vyakti ko chand par ek ghar denge or 2030 main modiji chand ko dharti par le aaenge'
 In 2028, Modiji will give every person from Gujarat a house on the moon and in 2030 Modiji will bring the moon to the earth — Office of RG (@officeofrg) on October 11, 2017, when BJP national president Amit Shah's takeover of Betejay Shah's company When a website was revealed, Rahul also targeted PM Modi on this too
 rahul ne twit main likhaa, 'modiji, jai shah- 'jaada' kha gaya

 It appears that he speaks someone else's voice rather than his own

 Addressing an election rally, Jaya said, 'A myth has been created that Gujarat ranks first in India

 The fact is that Gujarat specializes in its marketing, but under my leadership, Tamil Nadu is focusing more on work rather than on hollow claims
 ' Earlier, intensifying the attack on the AIADMK and the DMK, Modi accused both parties of being interested in settling each other and said that they had nothing to do with working in the interest of the people

 a day after the announcement, shares of rcom along with the other six companies of the group fell below the mark, in which rcom shares plunged by 48 per cent

 Ambition on the head This rise and fall of one of the most controversial businessmen in India in more than a decade is a perfect example of knowing that unbridled ambition can spread hands and feet in many businesses simultaneously and cannot handle them
 How can an unfavorable business environment shatter a business empire, along with indiscriminate borrowing to spread business

 After his death Mukesh, a chemical engineer with a management degree from Stanford, became chairman of RIL and MBA Anil managing director from Wharton

 is bich reliance infrastracchar railway, bijli or sadakon kii pariyojnaon ke liye bhi boli laga rahaa tha
 The cash-starved Anil's current condition was described by his lawyer Mukul Rohatgi while advocating on his behalf during the hearing of the Erikson case this February
 rohtagi ne adaalat se kaha, ''koi bhi apni company ganvaana pasand nahin karata
 Unfortunately, bad days have come on rcom
 maine ise bachaane kii koshish kii, par nahin bachaa sakaa
 "in the presence of Chhota Ambani, who is standing there and watching the court proceedings," Rohatgi said, "now it is up to the IRP (interim Solution Professional to be appointed for the insolvency process)

 a stock market commentator, who does not want to be named, says, "his decisions did not come out of precautionary tactics
 ye faisle mahatvakanksha ke pher main padakar liye gaye the
 Another commentator says that it was fashionable (in those days) to bid for heavy projects in which funds were levied through public sector banks (psbs) at the behest of political parties
 2008 main liman bros ke dharashayi hone ke fouran baad ai aarthik susti ke thik pehle maahaul yah tha ki apane desh or videsh donon main adhigrahan or vistaar par khulkar rakam kharch kii jaae

 Anil then got embroiled in a long legal battle with Mukesh
 isamen jhagade kii jad us gas kii keemat thi, jo ke-ji basin main mukesh ke tel kshetron se uttar pradesh ke dadri main anil ke prastaavit 4,000 megawatt ke bijli sanyantr ko di jaani thi

 $ 2 per million metric British thermal unit (MMBTU) had to be agreed, while in 2005 the two brothers were 2 for 17 years
 34 dollar mmbitiu kii keemat par raji ho gaye the
 Experts say that this may have given wrong signals to the international community to fix the price of natural resources, but due to the legal battle-fighting, the estrangement between the two brothers deepened
 2014 main anil ne jameen hasil karne main aa rahi dikkaton or gas kii supplai se jude muddon kaa hawala dekar dadri pariyojna se haath khinch liye
 However, the media showed an exaggeration of Anil's meetings with Mukesh, whether they were at a business conference or more recently at family events, including Mukesh's daughter Isha's marriage to Anand Piramal, son of businessman Ajay Piramal
 Has apparently never forgiven Anil for this legal quarrel

 Anil's agreement to buy the telecom business was seen as a good gesture from Mukesh, but he refused to become the guarantor of his brother's liabilities and allowed the deal to happen again
 In his business relationship with the United States, he showed his true stand
 ek vishleshak kehete hai, ''anil ko bachaane ke liye mukesh tinke kaa sahaara bhi nahin denge
 The example of brothers coming together again is very rare in the business houses of India
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki is dushmani kii jaden donon bhaaiyon se bhi aage parivaar main gaharaai tak faili hai

 The same thing has happened with the 700 crores allegedly offered by the UAE to help the Keralite victims
 jise lene se bharat kii sarkaar ne manaa kar diya kyonki bharat kii niti, bharat kaa swabhimaan is baat kii manzuri nahin detaa ki wo apni aapadaa main videshi madad le
 The money with which the swords were drawn in India's parties, the money for which the political parties were bent on degrading the government of their own country, that money was never actually offered by the UAE
 yuai ne saafe kaha he ki hamane sirf madad kii peshkash kii he
 Where the figure of 700 crore rupees came from, we do not know
 yuai se700 karod rupemilne kii baat sabase pehle kerala ke mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan ne kahi
 a press release from his office was posted on Facebook on 9 August 56 minutes on August 21, in which he wholeheartedly thanked Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE that he raised Rs 700 crore for Kerala
 Announced help
 yahi press release kerala ke mukhyamantri ke twitor handle se twit bhi kii gai
 On August 22, there was also a tweet from the UAE Prince Nahyan
 is twit main unhone sankat kii is ghadi main bharat kii har sambhav madad kaa bharosa diya
 But nowhere did it say that UAE is giving 700 crore rupees for the flood victims of Kerala
 twit main unhone ye bhi likhaa ki bharat ke pradhanmantri se baat karke unhone apni peshkash unke saamne rakh di he
 Thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the tweet was tweeted in response to Prince's tweet
 us twit main bhi kahin is baat kaa zikr nahin tha ki yuai ne 700 karod rupye kii madad kaa elaan kiya he
 However, it was revealed from the CM of Kerala that the Malayalam industrialist of the UAE has informed them about getting 700 million rupees from the UAE
 is khabar ke baad kerala main sarkaar chalaa rahi left partiyon ke netaaon ne desh kii sarkaar chalaa rahi bijepi par ye kahkar nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya ki apane desh kii sarkaar ne sirf 600 karod rupye hi die, jabaki yuai kii sarkaar ne 700 karod rupye kii madad kaa elaan kar diya
 The matter escalated even further when India refused to seek any financial assistance from the UAE and the Left alleged that the government was discriminating against Kerala, so the offer of help was turned down
 is baat par ab bharat main yuai ke rajdoot ne saafe kar diya he ki unki taraf se bharat ko madad kaa bharosa zarur diya gaya, lekin 700 karod rupye kaa aankada kahaan se aayaa, unhen nahin pataa
 Surprisingly, the political parties came down on demoralizing their own country with money that was never given
 aise main sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya kerala ke siem ne 700 karod rupye par jhooth bolaa? On this Guru Purnima, Bollywood stars wished fans on social media in their style
 kisi ne massej likhaa to kisi ne apane idal ke saath tasviren share kin
 But actor Varun Dhawan went a step ahead
 unhone apane vairiphoid twitor handle se ek buumarang video share kiya jisamen varun karan johar ke pair choote najar aa rahe hai
 varun-alia's stigma shooting stopped for 15 days, this is the reason: In the video, Varun Dhawan is wearing Karan Johar's feet wearing jeans T-shirt and sports shoes, and Karan is blessing him by wearing a coat-pat tie in the formal look Huh
 yah video kaaphi dilachasp he or ise ab tak takreeban 3 lakh logon ne like kiya he
 In the caption of the video, Varun Dhawan wrote, "happy Guru Poornima
 "happy guru purnimaa post shared byvarun Dhawan(@varundvn) onjul 27, 2018 at 6:41am pdtvarka front kii baat karen to varun pichhali baar film 'oktober' main najar aae the

 Talking about upcoming films, Varun will soon be seen opposite Anushka Sharma in the film Sui Dhaaga
 malayalam filmon kii ek actress ke saath apharan or yon utpeedan kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad khulaasa hua he ki pehle bhi aisi teen ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 Actor-director Lal has said that there have been incidents in the past in which women were kidnapped and sexually harassed
 abhinayta ne kerala police se yahsuchana milane kaa daawaakia he
 
 abhinayta laal ne kaha ki purv kii ghatnaon ko report nahin kiya gaya
 Lal is the same actor whose home reached South Indian actress after harassment
 shuukravaar raat hui thi ghatnarajya main ek giroh ne malayalam kii ek lokapriy abhinetri ke saath haal hi main kathith taur par yon utpeedan kiya tha
 Five people kidnapped the actress on Friday night in a busy area
 idhar, ghatana ke khilaaf yojit ek virodh sabha main kai filmi sitare pahunche the
 Addressing them, Lal said that when the actress reached her house after the incident, soon after that she called up Kerala DGP Loknath Behera to tell her
 dijipi ne actor ko bataaya
 
 
 He told- 'during our conversation, the DGP told me that three such incidents have happened recently with people associated with the Malayalam film world
 lekin kisi ko bhi isaki jaankaree nahin mili
 Perhaps it was suppressed by giving money or abandoned because of fear of humiliation
 ' First the father and then the son! After Asaram, son Narayan Sai also finally reached jail
 vahi jail jahaan jane se bachane ke liye usne puure 13 karod rupee main police, nyaaypalika, sarkari doctor or jail staff ko kharidne kii naakaam koshish kii thi
 After being in the custody of Surat Police for 14 days, the court sent Narayan Sai to jail on Thursday
 ab asaram jodhpur jail main hai to vahiin betaa narayan sai surat jail main
 Narayan Sai finally reached the jail
 
 
 baap aage-aage betaa peeche-peeche, par manzil donon kii ek hi nikali wo bhi jail
 The only difference is that the father reached the jail three months and 17 days ago and the son has reached now
 asaram baapu to pichley teen maheene 17 din se jodhpur central jail main band hai
 With the passage of time, they are heard, they also fall asleep in jail
 par bete narayan sai ko pehali baar jail kaa didaar guuruuvaar ko hua
 It will take some time to get into the color of the jail, some nights will still pass heavily
 baap-bete ko jamaanat kaa intjaar
 
 
 Narayan Sai has been sent to jail on Thursday after the 14-day-long police custody ended
 ab narayan sai thik apane baap kii tarah tab tak jail main hi rahegaa jab tak ki use jamaanat nahin mil jaati
 Now the father has not got bail for three and a half months, even though he is old, so there is little hope that the son will get the deposit so soon
 narayan sai ke khilaaf pukhta chargeshit kii taiyaari main police
 
 
 As such, the Surat Police has taken full advantage of 14 days of police custody
 sutron kii maane to is dauraan hui poochtacha ke baad police ne narayan sai ke khilaaf tamaam jaruri saboot juta liye hai
 Now the preparation of the police is to prepare a strong and strong charge sheet against Narayan Sai
 surat police sutron ke mutabik jail jane se pehle narayan sai ne jo kuch kaha he wo sab camere main kaid he
 The victim girl's statement is also against her
 or to or police hiraasat ke dauraan hi police, nyaaypalika, sarkari doctor or jail staff ko kharidne kii uski sajeesh kaa khulaasa hone ke baad uski musiibat or bad gai he
 Last week, Surat police arrested six people, including a sub-inspector of the crime branch, and revealed that Narayan Sai had prepared a deal worth Rs 13 crore to buy police, judiciary, and jail staff
 inamen se paanch karod police ne baraamad bhi kar liye the
 Narayan Sai is under strict surveillance in the jail
 
 
 jail staff ko kharidne kii koshish ke baad ab police is baat par bhi najar rakhe he ki jail main rahane ke dauraan kahin narayan sai ko koi khaas suvidha to nahin di ja rahi? vaise sutron ke mutabik is khulaase ke baad khud jail staff bhi daraa hua he
 He knows that the police are keeping an eye on him, so if any jail staff makes any small concessions with Narayan Sai, then he will immediately come under suspicion

 It is worth noting that even after the arrest of Ashok Kumar, there were persistent reports that the main accused in the murder was someone else, which was why the Haryana government handed over the case to the CBI under pressure

 Sawant, who directed Laila in the film Wafa, is also waiting for her
 laila ne unki film jinnat main ku chha drishyon kii shooting karwaai or phir aise gaayab hui ki phir najar nahin ai
 Sawant was eyeing Laila at an audition held in Delhi in 2004
 chhante gaye sheersh 10 pratiyogiyon main vah mumbai main hue screen test main safal rahi thi
 Sawant told India Today, "she did not refuse to film an intimate scene with Rajesh Khanna
 '' laila ''acchhee, shant or kaam main man lagane vaali'' thi or film ke liye die gaye saadhe teen lakh ru
 Was satisfied with ve kehete hai, ''shelina dabang or haaavee rahane vaali thim or laila kii jindagi or kaam main lagaataar dakhal detii thim
 Laila intended that if she could not succeed more in Mumbai, she would try in the South's film industry
 filmon main apane kariyar ko khatm hota dekh vah afgaan khan jaise rahasypurna vyavsaayiyon ke saath samay bitaane lagi thi, jisase vah 2007 main lokhandwala ke ek hukka baar main mili thi
 Afghan Khan was in regular contact with Laila and the police say that she had received an SMS from Afghan Khan on Laila Khan's mobile requesting Laila not to leave Mumbai
 saavant kaa kahana he ki unhen laila ke ku chha jaan-pahchaan vaale log sandigdh lage the
 In December 2009, Laila invited Sawant to his bungalow in Igatpuri
 usne saavant kii mulaakaat arab ke do niveshkon se karwaai
 He says, "they wanted him to produce 15-20 crores in the production of a film
 kaa nivesh karen, or main us paise ko apana dikhaaun
 i refused, as i did not want to face the Income Tax Department questions
 '' baatcheet bina kisi nattejey ke samaapt ho gai
 Sawant lost contact with Laila after February 2011
 saavant kaa kahana he ki unhone laila kaa naam agali baar tab suna, jab vah srinagar main ek mujeec album kii shooting kar rahe the
 a state government official told him that a police team has gone to Mumbai to find out about the missing actress
 mumbari lautne ke baad march main saavant ne oshivara police thane main gumshudagi kii ek report darj karwaai, jiske bare main unka kahana he ki police ne use gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Laila's father Nadir Shah Patel had already filed a report
 farvari, 2011 main yah pataa chalane par ki is parivaar ko aakhri baar nasik main dekha gaya tha, maamla nasik police ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Police have not been able to find any clue in the investigation since then
 charchaa he ki is parivaar kaa sambandh sitambar, 2011 main dilli hycourt main hue visphot se he, lekin jaanch karne waalon kaa kahana he ki unhen iskaa koi saboot nahin mila he
 The Jammu and Kashmir Police has two arguments to confirm what the Mumbai Police believes
 ek theory maan kar chalati he ki afgaan khan jaise doston kii pratadna ke dar se shelina, laila or uske bhai-bahan vastav main desh chhodkar bhaag gaye hai
 The second theory is more disturbing
 iske mutabik, is parivaar ko sachmuch us shaks ne khatm kar diya jo uski sampatti par kabja karnaa chahta he
 Laila never got fame like Divya Bharti, but in her disappearance, she has also created the same mystery as her ideal divya was in her death

 The next year's assembly elections, the BJP has completed four years of its rule in Rajasthan
 is maukey par hui ghoshnaa ko agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 As the Congress is constantly besieging the BJP over the violation of democratic values, the BJP is trying to encircle the Congress in the name of democracy with its stakes like Democracy Defense Fighter and Democracy Defense Honor Fund
 yojana main kiya gaya badlavarajasthan main chunaavkarib aae to bijepi sarkaar ne phir immergency ko yaad kiya
 People who have been jailed for a year in the emergency already receive pension, but with slight changes the plan has been named - Democracy Defense Honor Fund
 ab is yojana ke tahat un logon ko bhi pension milegi, jo jail main band rahane ke vakt vyask nahin the
 Those Rajasthanis will also be entitled to pension, who have been in jail outside Rajasthan
 nae naam jodne ke liye bhi kanoon main kuch badlaav kiye gaye hai
 It is fine to give respect or pension to those fighting for democracy, but questions are also being raised on Vasundhara government
 zyada din nahin beete jab vasundhara sarkaar ko apana wo adhyadesh waapas lenaa padaa tha, jisamen sarkari afasaron or jajon ke khilaaf aaropon par uski manjuuri ke bina reporting karne tak se media par roak lagaai gai thi
 In such a situation, it is inevitable that with which mouth this government is talking about democracy

 The battle of the Election Commission is getting worse and worse
 pehle bijepi ne chunaav ayukta naveen chawla par congress se santhganth ke aarope lagaae
 Now the Congress has alleged a nexus between the Chief Election Commissioner and the BJP
 is bich sarkaar ne kamobesh saaf kar diya he ki gopalswami ke ritair hone ke baad naveen chawla hi mukhya chunaav ayukta honge
 For this, the Central Government will also send a proposal
 mukhya chunaav ayukta gopal swami kii chitthee ko lekar siyasat garmai hui he
 More or less all the parties have been mobilized, but the government, which has so far avoided speaking anything openly on this issue, has opened its mouth for the first time
 kanoon mantri hansraj bharadwaj ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle ayog ke bheetar uthaa vivaad acha nahin he
 It would have been better if the Election Commission had paid more attention to its work

 However, the Law Minister admitted that the letter of the Chief Election Commissioner had come to him from the Prime Minister's Office and he would soon send his opinion on it to the President
 chunaav ayog ke bheetar kii is khinchataan se bijepi ko ek auki mauka mil gaya he
 The party is vigorously raising its old demand to remove Naveen Chawla

 However, many questions have also arisen from Gopalaswamy's letter which is going to create confusion about the rights of the Chief Election Commissioner and the other two Election Commissioners and for the health of democracy which needs to be answered
