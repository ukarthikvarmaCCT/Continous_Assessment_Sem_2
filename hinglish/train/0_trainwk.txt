 sutron kii maane to maanjhi apane se milane vaale har netaa se yahi kehete hai ki chaahe lalu yadav hon yaa nitish kumaar yaa sharad yadav, vah unke saamne jhukne vaale nahin
 His political understanding behind this is that now he will not get any special political benefit from Janata Dal United and if he continues to maintain his rebellious attitude, then it can prove to be a very big 'asset' not only in Bihar politics but also for BJP
 Huh
 lekin philhal rajnatik jaankaron kii maane to jab tak rashtriya janata dal or janata dal united kaa vilay nahin hota, maanjhi kii kursi bachi rahegi

 Due to Gaurav's telling Priyanka her points, she looked quite upset and wept in front of Rahul

 Lopa asks Gaurav to get her points back from Priyanka, but Gaurav says she does his evil behind him and has a double face

 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor is again in the discussion regarding his 'hindu Pakistan' statement
 unhone india today se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki agar bijepi deen dayaal upaadhyaay ko follow karne kaa daawa karti he to vah desh ko hindu pakistan banane kii hi koshish karegi
 He said that RSS and BJP follow the ideology of Hindutva
 bijepi netaa saavarkar, gowlavkar or deen dayaal upaadhyaay ko apana menter maanate hai
 These people did not follow the Constitution
 congressi netaa ne kaha ki yah khatra lagaataar bana hua he ki ve apni vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par is desh ko hindu pakistan banane ja rahe hai
 Tharoor said that he has read seriously the writings of RSS and BJP leaders
 vah unke likhe hue ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 The RSS gave the principle of Hindu Rashtra
 sabase pehle saavarkar ne aisa likhaa
 BJP has also put his picture in Parliament
 saavarkar or deen dayaal upaadhyaay ne bhi isi vichaar ko aage badhaayaa
 Tharoor further said that the Prime Minister has given instructions to every ministry that programs should be organized for Deen Dayal Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay bharat ke samvidhan ko nakaarte the
 He followed Savarkar and Golwalkar
 isi aadhaar par upaadhyaay samvidhan dwaara di gai bharat kii paribhaasha ko nakaarte hai or kehete hai ki bharat kaa matlab kisi kshetra se na hokar hinduon se he
 People of other religions living here are outsiders
 yahi vichaar maujuuda sarkaar ke hai
 i am only trying to tell people what these people think about the nation
 unhone aage kaha ki ab agar bijepi sarkaar yah kahati he ki vah in logon ke vichaaron ko nahin maanati he or ve ab is desh ko hindu raashtra nahin bananaa chaahate hai to ve meri aalochana kar sakate hai
 He has not yet announced his withdrawal from the views of these people
 isliye desh ke 'hindu pakistan' banane kaa khatra kam nahin hua he
 This worries the Liberals like me and is not ready for it, because we have grown up in an era of socialism, brotherhood and inclusiveness
 'nahin hatoonga bayaan se peeche'tharur ne kaha ki agar 2019 main bijepi kii jeet hogi to hamaara desh 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega
 Tharoor said that he has no intention to back down from this statement and he will keep repeating it again and again
 congressi netaa shashi tharur ne guuruuvaar ko twitor or fasebuk par apane bayaan ko lekar safai bhi jari kii he
 Tharoor has said on Twitter that his bjp's victory in many places has distorted the statement of India becoming a 'hindu Pakistan'
 isliye vah apane bayaan ko phir se spasht kar rahe hai
 Along with this, he has given a link to his Facebook post
 Since some have bizarrely misconstrued my statement on the BJP seeking to turn India into a # hindupakistan, a short explanation of what the term means:https: / / t
 co / 8h5euzk5gy — Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor) July 12, 2018 He wrote on Facebook, 'I have said this before and will say it again
 pakistan kaa nirmaan bahusnkhyakon ke dharm ke aadhaar par hua tha
 This discriminates against religious minorities and does not give them equal rights
 bharat ne yah tark kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya jisase desh kaa vibhaajan bhi hua
 But the idea of BJP / RSS Hindu Rashtra is to make the country like Pakistan
 aisa desh jahaan alpsankhyakon ke dharm ko bahusnkhyakon kaa dharm ke adheen samajha jaataa he
 By doing this the country will become 'hindu Pakistan' and our freedom struggle was not fought
 na hi aise desh kaa vichaar hamaare samvidhan main sankalit he
 'BJP bid- Rahul demands apology
 Let me tell you that Tharoor said on Wednesday that if the BJP wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Constitution of India will be in danger
 bharat 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega
 He had said that democratic values would be jeopardized by bjp's victory in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 congress saansad shashi tharurake is bayaan par bijepi ne palatwaar bhi kiya tha
 BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi should apologize on Tharoor's statement
 haalanki congress ne tharur ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he
 On Tharoor's statement, Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot said, "he will tell what he said and what his intention was
" meraa maananaa he ki aap agar sarkaar kii aalochana kar do to aap rashtradrohi ho

 lekin agar ginati ke lihaaj se dekhen to is seat par zyaadaatar samay congress jitati rahi he
 The seat has also been represented by senior Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and his wife Deepa Das Munshi, who are currently the mps of the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M), known for their opinions in the House
 sansad kaa koi aisa satr nahin hota he jisamen mohammad saleem ne apane tarkpurna vaktavy se sadan ko aakarshith na kiya ho
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a strong base in West Bengal

 In this context, saving this seat in the Lok Sabha elections 2019 can be challenging for the CPI (M)

 is seat par congress lagaataar 1971 tak jitati rahi jo bataata he ki yahaan jawahar laal nehru kaa asar kaayam rahaa

 Disputes arise from time to time
 2005-06 main uttarakhand main tatkaaleen narayan dutt tiwari sarkaar ne dharmik paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye chardhaam vikaas parishad kaa gathan kiya tha
 Under this council, there were plans to bring such temples including Badri, Kedar, Gangotri, Yamunotri, which have annual offerings of more than one crore rupees
 lekin yah muhim us vakït dhari rah gai, jab tatkaaleen tehri naresh or saansad raja maanavendra shah ne iskaa virodh shuru kar diya
 a similar controversy is once again raising its head
 is baar yah kumaun mandal ke almoda jile ke ek pramukh shiv mandir jageshwar main jilaster par bani cameti ko lekar he
 It happened that the Nainital High Court issued a directive regarding the Jageshwar temple to form a committee under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate to oversee the temple and keep an account of the expenditure
 cameti main chaar sadasyon ko rakhane kii baat kahi gai
 According to the court order, the District Magistrate appointed a committee nominated on behalf of the Governor and vice-chairman and another person as manager, by constituting a committee in his presidency
 rajya puraatatv surveykshan vibhaag ke adhikari ko bhi sadsy banaaya gaya to pujaariyon ke bich se bhi ek chaynit sadsy rakhaa gaya
 Now this committee is under dispute
 jageshwar gram panchayat ke pradhan mohan chandra bhatta kehete hai, ''yah cameti hi galat tareeke se bani he
 The intention of the High Court has been denied
 " unka aarope he ki teenon sadasyon ko mandir ke ek hi dhade se le liya gaya
 Pankaj Bhatt, a social activist, argues, "since ancient times, there have been three types of priests in the operation of the Jageshwar temple - one a morning priest, another a bhog priest and a third panda
 cameti main sirf praat: pujari gut se sadsy chun liya gaya
 "according to Sashti Dutt Bhatt, the eldest priest of the Mahamrityunjaya temple, the committee constituted for the temple has wrongly counted the priests
 ve kehete hai, ''jila prashasan ne mandir main pujaariyon kii sankhya 74 darj kii, jabaki mandir main maatr 12 pujari hai
 These are known as pandas
 bhoga pujari or praat: pujari to mandir ke karmchaaree hai
 "the committee has fixed different rates of worship in the temple, due to which there is anger among devotees
 ab pujari samaaj iske khilaaf hycourt jane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 State Governor Aziz Qureshi on August 15, 2014, directed the state government to set up an authority for the development and management of all religious places in Uttarakhand and said that religious sites should be developed by making a Shrine Board on the lines of Vaishnodevi or Tirupati
 
 isse paryaton ko badhaava milegaa
 After his statement, there has been a panic among the Mahants and Matadhis who occupied the religious places
 haalanki hycourt bhi kai baar in dharmik sthalon ke liye kaaryayojna banane ke nirdesh de chukaa he
 But all the exercises seem helpless in front of the effective people running these temples and the trusts established here
 haridwar ke ek saamaajik kaaryakarta je
 P
 badoni ne mandiron ke naam par ho rahe ghapale or dhaandhliyon ke khilaaf rajya hycourt main ek janhit yachika darj kar haridwar ke teen mandiron kii ore adaalat kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 Badoni argued, "the Swayambhu trusts built for the maintenance and arrangement of the Har ki Paadi, Manasadevi and Chandidevi temples are actually built by encircling government land, forests or Nazul land
" haalat yahaan tak pahunch gai he ki chandi devi mandir ke paanch mahanton par to kutarchit vasiyat banaakar dhokhadhadi karne tak kaa maamla darj he
 Despite this case lodged at Shyampur police station a year ago, the police have not arrested any of them till now
 darj report ke anusaar, police ne in paanchon par dhara 420,119 bi, 467 or 468 ke tahat mukadmaa jarur panjikrut kiya
 "badoni also claims to have built the second major temple of Manasadevi on forest land
 unke mutabik, sarkari jaanch-paimaaish main bhi yah baat sabit hui he ki mandir ko 0
 4 hectares of land was leased
 mandir ke vistaar ke liye mandir chalaane waalon ne 
 Took possession of 07 hectares of land and illegal encroachment
 badoni kehete hai ki mandir ke paas bhi 40 dukaane banaakar bech daali gai hai or mandir trust kaa navinikaran tak kai varshon se nahin karaayaa gaya he
 On the other hand, Ramanand Puri Maharaj, who describes himself as the president of the temple trust and owning the temple, claims that his predecessor Mahant had obtained the will from a woman named Saraswati Devi
 ve kehete hai, ''sarkaar is mandir ko shrin board main nahin le sakati
 We have built a temple by purchasing land, investing money
 sarkaar ham par kaise pratibandh laga sakati he?" ve kehete hai ki hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf unhone supreme court main maamla darj kiya he
 The High Court has directed to issue a receipt instead of placing a donation in the temple
 ve kehete hai, ''isse shraddhaluon kii shraddha main fark padataa he
 People want to give secret donations
 "hakeekat yah he ki in sabhi mandiron main na keval dukaane bechakar vyapaar chal rahaa he, balki mandiron ke agal-bagal mandir banaakar unhen bhi oonchi daron par theke par diya ja rahaa he
 The temple built to tie Kalava in Chandi Devi and Mansa Devi temple is worth crores of rupees per year
 ke theke par uthaaya jaataa he, jiskaa koi hisaab nahin hota
 Mahants are using the income from temples to build their hotels, institutes and farm houses in personal interests
 kalava bandhavane ke liye 10 ru
 Mandatory, while offering is required separately
 har kii padi par prati varsh anumaanath: paanch karod shradghaalu aate hai
 So about 4 crore devotees visit Mansa Devi and Chandi Devi
 rajyapal ke pehle kai jaanch aayogon ne bhi shrin board ke tahat in mandiron kii vyavastha kiye jane kii baat kahi he
 After the death of 22 people during an accident on Somavati Amavasya in 1996, the then UP government constituted the Justice Radhakrishna Judicial Commission of Inquiry, which suggested the formation of a Shrine Board
 sattar ke dashak main upi ke tatkaaleen rajyapal em
 Chennaiireddy had talked about setting up a Shrine Board
 saansad rahete hue vijay bahuguna ne bhi sarkaar ko chennareddy or radhakrishna nyaayik ayog kaa hawala dete hue shrin board gathit karne ke liye patr likhaa tha
 The security committee set up for the state under the chairmanship of the chief secretary had identified 34 temples in Uttarakhand as sensitive religious sites
 2009 main gathit is samiti ne kedarnath main kisi khatarnaak sankat kii aahat tabhi vyakt kar di thi
 He also asked for encroachment in Kedarghati and removal of massive construction work from the river banks
 lekin sarkaar ne is sujhav ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Now the time will tell how seriously the government will take the instructions to set up a Shrine Board for all temples including Chardham on the lines of Vaishno Devi and Tirupati
 dekhen, sarkaar pandon-mahanton-mathadhishon ke dabaav main chuppi saadhe rakhti he yaa phir kedarnath kii traasadee se sabak lekar kadam uthaati he

 On Monday, the Congress had issued a booklet describing the central government as a 'u-turn government'
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki bocolate jari karne ke samay hi congress saansadon ko nirdesh de diya gaya tha ki yah masalaa sirf bocolate tak hi simit nahin rahegaa or sansad se sadak tak party is mudde ko uthaaegi
 The booklet was released on Monday
 Earlier, on completion of six months of the Modi government, the Congress released the booklet called 'U Turn Government' on Monday
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne bocolate jari karte hue kaha ki modi sarkaar apane 180 dinon ke kaarykaal main kul 25 baar vaade se palati he
 That is, every week the government is overturned by one of its promises, which is sheer deception of the public
 congress netaa ne kaha ki bijepi ne vot batorne ke liye janata ko jhuthe sapane dikhaae or ab sapanom ko todane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Making the issue of black money in the booklet, the Congress said that the government had promised that it would bring back the black money within 100 days, but the money was not returned yet
 dukhad to yah he ki ab sarkaar ke mantri or netaa aisi kisi dedline kii baat ko maanane ke liye bhi taiyaar nahin hai
 While Rajnath Singh himself talked about the return of black money in 100 days
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi netaa pehle jahaan khule taur par videshon main kaledhan kii rakam ke aankadon kaa bakhaan karte the, vahiin ab khud pradhanmantri 'man kii baat' main kehete hai ki unhen nahin pataa videshi bank khaaton main kitna kalaadhan he
 Whereas Nitin Gadkari had said that there is 21 lakh crores black money abroad
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki paisa vaapasi par sabhi ko 15 lakh rupee bhi milenge

 The sooner you start planning about money, the better
 aisa na karne par aksar baad main pachhataanaa hi padataa he
 When we are young, it seems that this is the time to have fun
 lihaaja hamen apni jindagi jini chahie
 This happens especially between 20-25 years of age
 lekin baad main samaj main aata he ki samay rahete agar paison kii keemat na samajhi jaae to ham bahut kuch achiv karne se rah jate hai
 Here are 5 major mistakes that youth often make during the age of 20-25 years: 1
 kariyar ke liye sahi plan na karnazyaadaatar bhartiya yuva yaa to doctor bananaa chaahate hai yaa phir ejeeniyar
 People do not understand their interest and capacity properly
 nateeja yah hota he ki koching main paise or apni mehnat barbaad karne kii res main shaamil ho jate hai
 Therefore it is important that you choose the right career at the right time and spend money and time in it
 2
 Relying on parents for money, there are many people who, despite earning themselves, are not able to give up the support of their parents completely
 aisa aksar pehali or duusari job main hota he ki yangsters rahane, khaane or baaki ke shauk ko puraa karne main sari selary maheenaa khatm hone se pehle hi kharch kar dete hai or phir parents se maangate he
 To avoid such a situation, it is important to learn money management
 3
 There should always be a responsibility to save money during the first and second jobs or even in college life
 bahut se log ek maheene bachaate hai or duusare maheene nahin
 Due to such negligence, their savings account remains empty and they have nothing at the time of need
 isaki ek vajah jarurat kii chizon main kharch karne kii jagah phaltu kharch karnaa bhi he
 4
 practical finance or mani management na samajhanaafinance kii practical nolej kaa hona behad jaruri he
 You should know that only by making small savings, you are able to buy things like home and car
 iske liye kuch financial blog aadi padhate rahanaa chahie jissenivesh ke munaafe vaale tareekon se waakif rahen
 5
 dur kii na sochnaamtaur par yangsters aaj main jeene main vishwaas rakhte hai or kal kii chintaa nahin karnaa chaahate
 But this irresponsible style forces them to repent later
 kuch samay baad ehsaas hota he ki pehle bachat kii sochane vaale dost aaj property or car kemalik ho chuke hai or ve vahiin ke vahiin rah gaye hai

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko dilli main obisi sammelan main coca cola or makdonald companiyon kaa hawala kya diya ki us par soshal media par chatkhaare liye jane lage
 What Rahul said earlier, he tells
 coca cola ko lekarrahul gandhi kaha tha, 'coca-cola company kaa naam aapane suna hoga, yahaan aisa koun vyakti he jisane coca-cola company kaa naam naa suna ho
 Who started the coca-cola Company? koun tha ye
 anyone knows
 main aapako bataata hum
 The man who started coca-cola was a shinkey seller
 wo america menshikanjibechata tha
 Used to add sugar to water
 uske experions kaa aadar hua
 Honor is respected, the money found became a coca-cola company
 'iske baad rahul nemacdonaldacompany ko lekar kaha, 'makdonald company kaa naam suna hoga aapane, aap sabane suna hoga
 Who commissioned it
 kya karata tha, wo koi mujhe bataa saktaa he
 He used to run a dhaba
 aap mujhe hindustan main wo dhaba vaala dikhaa do jisane coca-cola company banaai ho, kahaan he wo
 'let us tell you how these two famous companies of the world started
 coca-kolah kuch aise aayaa hamaare bichakoka-cola duniya main sabase zyada pahachaane jane vaale brand main se ek he jise 200 se zyada deshon main bechaa jaataa he
 coca-cola was started in 1886 by Dr
 John S
 Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, USA
 pembaraton ne america civil waar ke dauraan faujee ke taur par yuddh main hissaa liya tha or usamen buree tarah ghayal ho gaye
 After the war was over, Pemberton began resorting to morphine (opium extract) for pain relief, but being a pharmacist he knew that taking Marfin for a long period of time could be dangerous and addictive
 May take
 yahi vajah thi ki unhone aisi drink banane kii sochi jisamen opium nahin ho balki coca kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 Pemberton made a drink combining cocaine, cola nuts and another plant, which was previously named Pemberton's French Wine Cola
 is drink ko bechney ke liye pembaraton ne atlanta main apane ghar ke paas kii hi ek dukaan ko chunaa jiskaa naam jaikabs formasi tha
 Pemberton would take his syrup to the jug there and mix it with soda and sell it
 logon ko ye drink khub pasand aayaa
 The credit for naming coca-cola goes to the Pemberton accountant named Fancor Robinson
 unhone hi khaas tarah se cola-cola likhane kaa dizin banaaya jise aaj tak usee tarah se likhaa jaataa he
 But Pemberton, who discovered this world's most famous deink, could not take much advantage of it
 pembaraton kaa nidhan 1888 main hua
 But before that he had slowly sold his company
 aisa candler naam ke ek bijnesaman ne coca-cola kii takat ko pahachaanaa or isaki sari hissedari kharid lee
 Candler played the biggest role in leading coca-cola to this position
 aaj coca-cola duniya main 'oke' ke baad sabase zyada pahachaane jane vaala shabd he
 You can guess how much coca-cola is consumed in the world by the fact that if all its bottles are put in one line, then this line can return to the moon 1,677 times

 It is very important to spread awareness about this terrible disease where 30 million people are suffering from pneumonia
 haalanki iske lakshan saamaanya flu, chaati ke sankraman or khaansee ke lakshanon se milane kii vajah se isaki pahchaan kar paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Pneumonia is a type of infection in the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses and fungus, which causes a fluid to accumulate in the lungs and obstruct the flow of blood and oxygen
 agar aapako balgam vaali khaansee, seene main tej dard, tej bukhaar or gahari saanse aa rahi hon to ho saktaa he ki ye nimonia ho
 If you have a flu or a cold and despite all your efforts, it is not healing, then it is better that you go to the doctor immediately
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan (dablyuechao) kii ek report ke mutabik, paanch saal se kam umr ke bacchon ke marane or biimaar padane kii pramukh vajahon main se stryptococus nimonia pramukh he
 In this regard, the Secretary General of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr
 K
 ke
 Aggarwal says that pneumonia is most likely to occur in young children
 iske alaava samay purv prasav se janme bacchon main bhi nimonia hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 Children whose lungs are not fully developed, the air duct is tight, nutritional deficiency and those who have weak immunity are more at risk of pneumonia
 gande maahaul, kuposhan or stanpan kii kami kii vajah se bhi nimonia peedit bacchon kii maut ho sakati he
 Pneumonia spreads in many ways
 virus or bacteria aksar bacchon ke naak yaa gale main paae jate hanore agar ve saans se andar chale jaaen to fefdon main ja sakate hai
 They can also be spread via air ducts with cough or sneeze drops
 iske saath hi janm ke samay yaa uske turant baad khun ke sankramit ho jane se bhi nimonia fail saktaa he
 Pneumonia can be prevented through vaccines, proper nutritious diet and environmental hygiene
 nimonia ke bacteria kaa ilaaj antibiotic se ho saktaa he lekin keval ek tihaai bacchon ko hi antibiotic mil pate hai
 In such a situation, it is important to keep the children warm in winter
 dhoop ke sampark main kuch samay bitaane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae or kamaron main sillen na panpane di jaae
 In addition, they are also required to get proper nutritious diet and necessary vaccines
 niumococal konjuget vaxin or hymophills anfaluenza tip bi do pramukh vaxin hai, jo nimonia se bachaati hai
 But the problem is that 70 percent of the children do not get this vaccine due to expensive price and lack of information

 chunaav ayog kii sakhti ke baad bhi bhaashanon main sena kaa zikr kam nahin ho rahaa he
 When Chief Minister Yogi called the Indian Army as 'modi's Army' at a meeting in West UP, the Commission warned that to be cautious about such things in future
 nausena ke purv pramukh admiral el ramdaas ne chunaav ayog ko patr likhaa tha ki kya mukhyamantri ne modi kii sena bolkar aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya he? chunaav ayog ne niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ko bhi aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke maamle main chetavanee jari kii he
 The Election Commission has also found Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh guilty of violating the code of conduct and has written to the President for action, but the phase of apprehensions about the Election Commission is not over
 66 purv naukarshahon ne raashtrapati ko patr likhaa he or kaha he ki sattadhari party ke lagaataar aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke saamne chunaav ayog kamazor dikh rahaa he jo ki thik nahin he
 Julio Ribeiro, Dev Mukherjee, Harsh Mander, NC Saxena, Meena Gupta, Pia Dasgupta, Vibhapuri Das, Aditi Mehta, Sonalini Mirchandani, Meera Borwankar, Rashmi Shukla, Deepak Sanan, Najeeb Jung, Siraj Hussain, Jawahar Sarkar, S
 Balabhaskar, C

 Like many IAS, IPS, IFS and other services naukrashas have written letters
 raashtrapati ko likhe patr main kaha gaya he ki jis tarah se centre kii sattarudh party khuleam aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kar rahi he use dekhakar gahari chintaa ho rahi he
 The Election Commission seems weak in taking action against these violations
 dar rahaa he
 Some examples are given that the Prime Minister addressed the nation on 27 March 2019 on the successful testing of ASAT
 aachaar samhita ke kaaran isaki ghoshnaa diardio par chhod deni chahie thi
 Not only this, the announcement has not been made through the Public Broadcast Service
 chunaav ayog ne paaya ki koi ulanghan nahin hui he
 We believe that the Election Commission's decision was not based on standards of fairness
 hamaare samooh ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki chunaav khatm hone tak kisi bhi netaa ke jivan par film or documentry jari karne kii ijazat na di jaae
 The reply to our letter was not received, but it has been reported that the film is releasing on April 11
 jis din matdaan he
 We believe that all the money to make and promote the film should be cut from the Prime Minister's expenses

 Rather, they are asking to vote in the names of the martyrs of Pulwama and the airmen involved in the subsequent attack
 pehali baar vot kar rahe matadaata se ve apana vot nota ko samarpit karne ke liye nahin kar rahe hai, bijepi kaa naam nahin le rahe hai magar saaf he ki ve bijepi ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 Questioning the army is not right, so how is it right to use the army in elections? Now, in the name of the martyrs, if they will be asked to vote openly in this way, then how will this matter stop? shahid desh ke liye jaan detaa he yaa bijepi yaa congress ke liye? chunaav ayog ne haal hi main mukhyamantri yogi ko chetavanee de chukaa he ki bhartiya sena ko modi kii sena na kahen? yahaan pradhanmantri pulavama ke shaheedon or balakot strike main shaamil javaanon ke naam par apana vot samarpit karne ke liye kah rahe hai
 Is this election being held in the name of the army, then why should not the army also contest the election? Why are political parties contesting elections? When the second installment was to be given under the PM Kisan Samman Yojana, a code of conduct was introduced
 1 april ko dena tha
 The Election Commission gave his permission
 uske alaava do karod or adhik kisaanon kii pahchaan kar lee gai thi magar unhen donon kishte nahin mili thim, unhen bhi paisa dene kii anumati di gai
 After the imposition of the code of conduct, but on the other hand, the Commission banned the Kalia scheme of Naveen Patnaik in Odisha
 ise lekar naveen patnayak bhubaneshwar main chunaav adhikari ke karyaalay pahunch gaye
 Naveen Patnaik says that the BJP had complained about the ban
 kaaliya skim main paanch kishton main 25, 000 dene kii baat kahi gai he

 Today Tarun Pratap Singh, an onlooker from Farrukhabad district of UP, sent us a picture of a primary school

 Don't you think that the color of this school matches the bjp's flag? kuch din pehle hamane baliya se isi tarah ke ek skool kii tasviir dikhaai thi, jise hamaari report ke baad safed rang main rang diya gaya
 Now look at this school
 kisi adhikari ko agar aachaar samhita kaa basic gyaan hoga to vah is tarah ke rang se rangane nahin detaa
 There was a time when the elephant statues at Ambedkar Park in Lucknow were covered before the election, as the photograph of the elephant resembled the BSP flag
 aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad ilaake main afasaron kii awajahi bad jaati he
 It is not possible that no one has noticed

 Tarun told that he has taken this picture today

 Whenever the election comes, there are reports from the villages that the people of such and such village are boycotting the election
 har rajya se is tarah kii awaz aati he
 Obviously, facilities do not reach the villages properly

 Now this news is from a village in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh
 jepi kaa gaanv kaha jaataa he
 Daljit Tola of Sitabadiara and people of Bhavan Tola village have said that they will not vote
 nadi ke kataan ke kaaran gaanv gaayab hota ja rahaa he
 These villages are not included in the dam being built in the area, so the people of this village have taken an oath that they will boycott the Lok Sabha elections
 hamaare sahyogi karunaa sindhu ne yah jaankaree di he
 There is similar news from a village in Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu
 skool suvidha nahin hone ke kaaran logon ne kaha he ki ve chunaav kaa bahishkaar karenge
 Meanwhile, just 48 hours before the first round of voting, five people, including BJP MLA Bhima Mandavi, died in a horrific Naxalite attack in Bastar area of chhattisgarh
 ye vaardaat dantewada zile ke nakulnar ilaake main hui
 The first round of voting is to be held in Bastar and today was the last day of campaigning there
 
 
 bhima mandavi ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kar laut rahe the ki ghaat lagaae naksaliyon ne ek iidi ke istemaal se unki gaadi ko uda diya
 
 
 The explosion was so terrible that it blew away the car and caused a huge hole in the ground

 All four were in the Chhattisgarh Police

 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also criticized the attack and called the slain MLA Bhima Mandi a dedicated worker of BJP and sent his family's consolation
 
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi has intensified as soon as the Lok Sabha elections are over
 guuruuvaar ko raibareli main sonia gandhi ke namakan karne ke baad rahul ne ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhrashtachar par bahes karne kii chunauti di
 Rahul said that if the Prime Minister says yes, then he is ready to come to the race course and debate
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khuli chunauti dete hai ki vah bhrashtachar par unase bahes kar len
 Rahul said that if there was a debate, it would be known that the watchman is a thief
 unhone is dauraan supreme court ke dwaara rafel par punarvichaar yachika ko sweekaar karne kaa bhi tark diya
 Explain that the Central Government had received a clean chit from the Supreme Court earlier on Rafael, but on Wednesday, the court accepted the papers printed by a newspaper as a document
 vahiin, rafel par punarvichaar yachika sweekaar kar lee
 Since then, the Congress party has been an attacker again on this issue, Rahul also said on Wednesday that the Supreme Court has agreed that the watchman has committed theft
 Rahul Gandhi: There have been many people in Indian history who had arrogance to believe that they're invincible & bigger than the people of India
 Narendra Modi for the last 5 yrs has done nothing for the ppl of India
 His invincibility will be in full view after election resultspic

 pradhanmantri 15 minute bhi unke saamne tik nahin paaenge
 Rahul Gandhi gave the slogan 'chowkidar Chor Hai' only after the Rafale controversy, since then he has been moving forward on this matter
 rahul ne vaada bhi kiya he ki agar unki sarkaar aegi to vah rafel ke kagajaton kii jaanch karaayenge or chaukeedaar jail main hoga

 Unlike Dhoni's Bollywood style biopic, "sachin: a Billion Dreams" has its master blaster at its center
 yahi baat film ko special bhi banaati he
 The story is of a ten-year-old child
 jiske liye ek saamaanya khel pishan ban jaataa he or is pishan kaa rigelt aata he 2011 main jab bharat cricket world cap jeet jaataa he
 Nanhe Sachin's visit to coach Achrekar, flying blows of legendary bowlers, love for Anjali, betting on cricket and setting a century soon after his father's death are moments that give a lot of passion, action and emotion
 routine bollywood filmon se hatakar yah ek acha efort he
 Again and again Sachin and his voice make nostalgic
 sachin actor nahin hai, lekin jitne simple, pashnet or inocent ve cricket ke maidan main rahe, utane hi film main bhi hai
 But in the film A
 aar
 Rahman's music is very average
 lekin diarector ne jis sayaanepan se vijual or sachin kaa istemaal kiya he wo film ko salid banane kaa kaam karata he
 "sachin: a Billion Dreams" is a great film to get to know the inadvertent aspects of the life of the God of cricket and the person who has touched emotions in cricket
 yah film sachin ke junun or jazbe ko sailyut karti he
 It is no less than a treat for those who have not been witness to the Sachin era and also have a chance to relive the old memories of those who have lived with Sachin for almost two and a half decades

 There is a need to improve the supply of goods
 unhone jor dekar kaha, isamen se zyaadaatar kaary rajya sarkaron ke adhikaar kshetra main aate hai

 kohli with the ICC Champions Trophy on his arrival in englanda post shared by Team India (@indiancricketteam) onmay 25, 2017 at 5:20 am PDT lambey samay se bollywood se gaayab raheen amisha patel susi ganeshan kii film ‘shortkurt romeo’ se lead role main kambek kar rahi hai
 Amisha has left no stone unturned to make her comeback a success
 film ke hero ke rup main apni pahchaan bana rahi amisha ne na sirf pehali baar negative kirdaar nibhaayaa he balki apni superhit film 'gadar' ke baad ek baar phir lovemeking seens se apane kairactor main jaan daalane kii koshish kii he
 In 'gadar: Ek Prem Katha' (2001), where Amisha was a devotional wife, in 'shortcut Romeo', she has become a rich woman bored of her married life
 apane paison ke dam par apni kaam ichha kii tripti ke liye vah bahari jariya apanaati hai or shortkat romeo ke changul main funs jaati hai
 If sources are to be believed, then persuading Amisha to do anything for her lovemaking scenes proved to be crooked for director Susie Ganesan
 kaaphi samajhane ke baad amisha is seen ko karne par raji huin
 It remains to be seen how much Amisha's move brings color because 'gadar' was her super-duper hit film, 'shortcut Romeo' takes her to far

 sabane bharat main badhate bev siries ke craij par baat kii
 Richa is appearing in the web series 'inside Edge'
 unhone kaha ki filmon kaa model ab kaam nahin kar rahaa
 If films are made in 3 crores today, then 5 crores will have to be put on release
 kai filmein relies par atak jaati hai
 If i live in Mussoorie, then i have to go to Dehradun to see films like 'masan'
 distribution kaa panga he
 That's why small budget films get beaten up
 theatre main raashtragan galat, notebandi sahi: manthan 17 main sonu nigam ke 10 bade bolweb siries ke pressure ke bare main unhone kaha ki pressure to bahut he
 The effort was more in 'inside Age' and that's why i took the money from the film
 web siries log apane pes par dhire-dhire dekhte rahete hai
 At the time of our parents, good shows like 'nukkad', 'buniyaad' used to come on TV
 ab tivi ke darshak bhi badal gaye
 'buniya' viewers may be able to relate less to new serials
 jo log hollywood tivi shoj dekhte hai unhen hamaara sho utana acha nahin lagata
 Present is not Digital Future
 unhone kaha ki maine digital par bakawaas chijen bhi dekhi hai
 People forcefully abuse
 yah freedom kaa missuj he
 Censorship will come in this in a few days
 sonu nigam ne kaha- main sampradayik nahin, PAK ke raashtragan kaa bhi sammaan karuungahalanki tivi ke shoj ko log digital par bhi dekhte hai
 Content is being viewed both
 richaa kaa maananaa he ki cinema ko digital se khatra he
 Small audiences do not come to watch short films
 produsar gul khan ne 'tanahaiyaan' web siries banaai he
 He has been active on TV for about 15 years
 unhone 'ishkbaaj', 'kabool he' jaise shoj banaae hai
 During the program, he said - Web series is not dependent on our personal choice
 yah duniya kii maang he
 There is no distribution problem in this
 logon kii lagata tha tivi chota medium he
 People wanted to do films, but now times have changed
 web siries main aap ek aisa sho bana sakate hai, jo sirf ghar kaa ladkaa dekhen
 a show can become something that only a mother-in-law can watch
 tivi par shoot bahut lambii chalati hai
 The shooting of the web series ends very quickly
 hamanen 'tanhaaiyaan' hot star ke liye banaai thi
 TV and digital audiences are the same
 gul kaa maananaa he ki ham tivi kaa jitna bhi ham majaak uda, lekin ye khatm nahin hoga
 89 percent of web audiences also watch TV
 unhone aage kaha- nagin, dian ke sho pataa nahin kaise chal rahe hai
 The serial shows the girl waking up in the morning, worshiping, solving all the problems, but i did not want to show girls like that in my shows
 haalanki supernatural element hollywood main bhi he
 People do not want to adopt new things
 tivi kaa majaak udaana aasaan he
 Nakul Mehta, who appeared in the show 'ishqbaaz', also produced a web series called 'I don't watch TV'
 unhone kaha- main bahut dinon se apana content banane kii soch rahaa tha
 We depend on actor writers
 tivi kii duniya bahut atarangi he
 Three years ago, when i went to the people with the idea of web series, people said, "make it in the phone
" roni scruwala ko meraa idia pasand aayaa
 Content depends on what people would like to see
 unhone kaha ki web siries ke actors bhi bahut popular hote hai
 Sumit Vyas (permanent Rooms fame) is very famous
 tivi main popularity aasaan he, lekin web siries ke actors bhi popular hote hai
 We want the audience to see whatever work we do
 manthan 2017: pariniti boli- golmaal mere kariyar kii sabase badi film, dhamal karne ai puri team'permanent rummets' ke mikesh yani sumit vyas ne bhi web siries par apni raay rakhi
 He said- 'permanent roommates' in 2017
 uske baad bahut badlaav aayaa
 If i wanted to do something on the Internet, the producers thought that this is our hobby, we are not serious
 lekin ham syriasli kaam karte the
 We had no money at that time
 us samay tivi par aise shoj aate the, jisamen dikhaaya jaataa tha ki 50 saal pehle kya hua hoga
 Strange things (flying vehicles) were also being shown in films
 rosemara kii jindagi nahin dikhaai ja rahi thi
 When asked if people come for money and fame in TV and films
 is par unhone kaha- mujhe nahin lagata ki sab paise kamaane or fame ke liye hi aate hai
 Some people also come to tell the story
 unhen mauka miltaa he ki wo apni tarah se kahani suna saken
 He told that the web series earns from the brands
 kahani main brands ko dikhaaya jaataa he
 'tripling' featured 'tata Tiago'
 agar brand kahani kaa hissaa ban jaataa he to wo utana bura nahin lagata
 On censorship in web series, he said - Audience is sensible
 unhen pataa he ki unhen kya dekhnaa he
 You are not being forced into web medium
 aap khud mobile yaa laptop main khol kar web siries dekhte hai

 The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Bachelet also asked to ensure that the National Civil Register (NRC) verification in Assam does not deprive people of the nation
 unhone kashmir par kaha ki unke karyaalay ko niyantran rekha ke donon taraf kii maanavadhikaar sthiti ko lekar report mil rahi he
 In the inaugural address of the 42nd session of the Human Rights Council, he said, 'I am extremely concerned about the impact on the human rights of Kashmiris by the recent steps of the Government of India including internet communication and ban on peaceful assembly and detention of local leaders and activists Is included
 bharat dwaara jammu kashmir kaa vishesh darja samaapt karne ke liye anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ko samaapt karne or rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baantne ke nirnay ke baad bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav bad gaya he
 Pakistan had reacted strongly to this
 bachalet ne kaha, 'main bharat or pakistan kii sarkaron se yah aagrah karti hum ki maanavadhikaron kaa sammaan or raksha ho
 i have particularly urged India to relax the current ban or curfew that would ensure people's access to basic services and that all due process rights of those detained should be respected
 'bachalet ne kaha ki yah mahatvapurn he ki aise kisi bhi nirnay kii prakriya main kashmir ke logon se mashvira kiya jaae or unhen shaamil kiya jaae jiskaa unke bhavishya par prabhaav padataa he
 India has said that it is an internal matter to abolish most of the provisions of Article 370
 bharat ne saath hi 'gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaanbaji' or bharat virdohi or uske aantarik muddon par uksaave vaale bayaan dene ko lekar pakistan kii kadi aalochana kii he
 Bachelet also said that the recent National Citizen Register verification process in Assam has generated a lot of uncertainty and concern, under which about 19 lakh people have been excluded from the final list published on 31 August
 unhone bharat sarkaar se anurodh kiya ki apil kii prakriya ke dauraan uchit niyamon kaa paalan ho, logon ko waapas na bheja jaae yaa hiraasat main nahin liya jaae or sunishchit kiya jaae ki log raashtra viheen na hon
 India says that updating NRC is a statutory, transparent, legal process carried out at the behest of the Supreme Court of India
 bharat sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki enarasi se baahar hone se assam ke nivasee kisi vyakti ke adhikaron par koi prabhaav nahin padegaa
 The Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued last week, 'those whose names are not in the final list will not be taken into custody and they will continue to get all the rights they have until the options given to them under the law are exhausted

 taanashaah kim jong un kii harkaton se pehle hi puri duniya se alag-thalag pad chukaa north korea ab or ghirne laga he
 He can also lose his friendship with China
 is duniya main china hi un gine-chune mulkon main ek he, jiske north korea se thik-thaak rishte hai
 But now, due to North Korea's nuclear tests and the growing tensions with the US, China has started thinking about changing Kim Jong Un's rule in North Korea
 is masale par pehali baar china main khuli bahes kii shuruyaat hui he, jis par ab tak kanoonee pabandi thi
 That means the dictator of North Korea is a bit more besieged
 kim halke main lene kii galatinarth korea kaa taanashaahakim jong unduniya ko tabah karnaa chahta he
 Especially to US President Donald Trump
 jo use halke main lene kii galati baar-baar kar rahe hai
 He sometimes called him Rocket Man
 kabhi mad main
 So freak man sometimes
 is baat ko jaan kar bhi wo naa jane kyon anjaan hai ki uske paas 5-5 parmaanu or hidrogen bam hai
 If that crazy freak becomes crazy, then it will bring such devastation that its entire world will suffer
 china ke badale tevarlekin north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un or america raashtrapati donald trump kii dushmani to ab jagajaahir he, is story main ab nayaa pench ye he ki kim jong un kii harkaton par china kaa mizaaj bhi tikhaa ho chalaa he
 Yes, that China, which alone is considered to be the closest country to North Korea in the whole world, has started thinking about Kim Jong Un's rule
 china main ise lekar nai or khuli bahes chhid gai he ki kya ab north korea se kim jong un kii hukumat khatm honi chahie?kim se naaraaz dragonakal tak koi china main aisi bahes ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa tha, lekin ab lagata he ki north korea main lagaataar hote parmaanu pareekshanon ko dekhte hue ab china kaa rukh bhi badalane laga he
 It is another matter that even now China's official agenda is to prepare North Korea and America for talks, so that there will be peace in the world
 lekin lagata he ki kim ke ravaiye se ab china bhi bidakane laga he
 Debate in China: Now North Korea is getting surrounded
 kim kii karatuuton par china ne bhi ankhen tareri hai
 a debate has begun in China over changing the regime of North Korea
 to kya kim ke kilaaf khadaa ho jayega china? ye sawaal ahm he
 However, it is also true that recently America has defied North Korea badly
 trump ne kim ko pagal, sanakee or naa jane kya-kya kehete hue barbaad kar dene kii dhamkee di he
 Even if such a common man is challenged, he too gets angry
 trump ne kim ko kaha meadmansbase pehle jaaniye ki aakhir maajaraa he kya
 Why did this devastation hit the world
 to iske liye sabase pehle america raashtrapati donald trump kii jubaan suniye
 He said, 'will teach Madman such a lesson, will remember it for a lifetime
 kim aisa pagal he, jo apane logon kii parvaah nahin karata
 Will shoot so much that the world will keep watching
 kim ke saath bheeshan jang kabhi bhi ho sakati he
 'america is making it difficult for a common man to be challenged in this way, then Jalal should also come
 ye to phir bhi kim jong un
 Do not tolerate listening to anyone in front of you
 phir bhi sabakuch jaanate boojhte hue america raashtrapati use taish dilaane vaale jumale suna rahe hai
 So he has also threatened to create such destruction in the Pacific Ocean with his hydrogen bomb that the whole world will come in his JD
 hydrogen bam se karegaa hamalaajo hydrogen bam kii takat ke bare main nahin jaanate
 They should hear again that this is such a powerful bomb that apart from the tsunami, it will bring water from sea to land and land will start to move from its place
 prashanth mahaasaagar main girakar north korea ke marshall kim jong un kaa hydrogen bam kya gazab dhane vaala he, isaki tafsil jaanakar aapke hosh ud jaaenge
 It is important to know how serious Kim Jong Un is about this feud and this threat
 kim ne trump ko di salaahkorean central news agency kii taraf se jari bayaan main kim jong un ne kaha 'ek daraa hua kutta zyaada jor se bhunkata he
 i would like to advise Trump that when he says something in front of the world, he should pay attention to his choice of words
 america raashtrapati kaa ek puure ke puure desh ko barbaad karne dene kii dhamkee dena unke maansik diwaaliyepan kaa subut he
 Since sitting in the President's chair, Trump has kept the whole world restless with his blackmailing and threatening talk
 wo kisi bhi desh kii sena kaa supreme commander banane ke qaabil hi nahin he
 Actually, he is not a politician, but a gangster who is fond of playing with fire
 donon ke jhagade main duniya kaa nuksaanaye to mahaz us gusse kaa izhaar he jo tamaam takat hone ke baavjood north korea kaa ye marshall apane kaleje main dabaae baitha he
 You must have guessed from his statement that how much of a threat from Trump has been inside his heart
 uske khilaaf ugale gaye har us alphaz kaa badla lene ke liye jo america raashtrapati donald trump ne uske liye kahen hai
 So it is a reward that one step he went back and one step he came back
 kyonki agar ye donon ek duusare ke khilaaf aise hi aag ulagate rahe to uski aanch main yakeenan puri duniya jhulas jaaegi
 China may leave Kim's side, but it seems that China can also leave North Korea
 abtak china main north korea main hukumat badalane ko lekar kisi bhi bahes par kanoonee roak thi
 But perhaps China now wants to put pressure on North Korea
 or tabhi usne sanyukt raashtra kii taraf se north korea par lagaae gaye nae or kathin pratibandhon kaa samarthan bhi kiya he
 Controversy once again arose on the statement of senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar
 is baar unki bhagwaan ram ko lekar kii gai tippanee par bavaal machaa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has tightened up on Aiyar's statement related to Ram Janmabhoomi, asking that he tell himself where he was born
after questioning Ram's place of birth, BJP on Tuesday asked Mani Shankar Aiyar to tell himself where Were born? BJP spokesperson Shalabh Mani Tripathi tweeted and asked Iyer that 'mani Shankar, who speaks a low language for Prabhu Ram, should first state in which room he was born

 She denies Ram Sethu, its leader Kapil Sibal is trying to hang the Ram temple issue in court, which is how Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement has come
 unhone kaha kimanishankar kaa bayansidhe taur par hindu aasthaa kaa khulaa majaak he
 The amount of condemnation is less
 gauratlab he ki ayyar ne somvaar ko ek kaarykram main kaha tha ki' mandir vahiin banaaenge kaa kya matlab he? dasharath ek bahut bade maharaja the
 It is said that there were ten thousand rooms in his palace
 koun jaanata he ki koun sa cameraa kahaan tha? isliye yah kahana ki ham sochate hai ki bhagwaan ram yaheen paidaa hue the, isliye yaheen mandir bananaa he, kyonki yahaan ek masjid he
 First we will break the mosque and instead we will build a temple
 yah galat he

 - If your Aadhaar is already linked to PAN, then the message will also come
 kyon aadhaar pan link karnaa jaruri?1 july se inakam tex ritern bharne or nayaa pan number praapt karne ke liye 12 ank kaa aadhaar number dena anivaary ho jayega
 The biometric facility provided through Aadhaar will make it easier for the tax department to catch tax frauds

 These 2
 87 karod logon main 1
 62 crore people filed tax returns but did not pay even a single rupee in tax
 aisa isliye ki badi sankhya main log tex chori kar le jate hai yaa tex dene se batch jate hai
 Therefore, to increase tax collection in the country, the Income Tax Department has made Aadhaar linking mandatory for filing returns
 is linking ke baad tex chori ko rokna aasaan ho jayega
 Having done AADHAR-PAN linking, now the Aadhaar card of 112 crore people has been made in the beneficiary

 The introduction of uniform tax system (gst-goods and Services Tax) across the country is the most important decision in Indian economic history
 kendra sarkaar 1 july se deshbhar main jiesti lagu karne kii kavayad ke chalate maujuuda sansad satr main jaruri kanoon ko paarit karaane kii koshish main he
 For this, after the broad consensus in all the states and the Center, the decision making system with transparency and the guarantee of the Central Government to compensate the states for the loss due to the new tax system, this decision is indeed the biggest ever for the tax system
 Will be an economic decision
 lekin ise paarit karne ke liye abhi bhi kai aise mudde hai jinpar kisi sahmati kaa elaan abhi tak nahin kiya gaya he
 Consent on these issues is also important because only after that a strong GST will take place in the country
 1
 a political consensus has to be made to keep the standard rate of GST at 18 percent
 If the central government wants to give the biggest benefit of GST to the consumer, then it is necessary that a consensus should be made to keep the standard rate of GST at 18 percent
 philhalarajyon main state waite kii standard dar14
 5 per cent and the rate of service tax is 15 per cent, while the rate of central excise is around 12 per cent

 In such a situation, neither the cost of business in the country can be reduced nor the prices can be controlled
 lihaaja, ek majboot jiesti ke liye ahm he ki desh main ej of duing bijness ke liye in chizon ko jiesti ke daayre main laane par sahmati bane

 But when this compensation is stopped, the challenge will be to increase revenue in front of economically weaker states
 lihaaja, kendra sarkaar ko abhi se kamjor rajyon main aarthik gatividhiyaan badhaane kii kavayad kerani hogi nahin to jiesti lagu hone ke baad aise rajyon kaa pichhadanaa bhi tay he
