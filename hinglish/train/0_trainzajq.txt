 Like other Babas, they too have declared themselves to be God
 magar ye bhagwaan hone ke saath ye daleel detaa tha ki uske ashram kii sabhi ladkiyaan uski 16 hazaar raniyaan hai
 Know who this god of 16 thousand queens is
 dilli kaa 'ram rahim'dilli main ek or 'gurmeet ram rahim' kaa khulaasa
 Another Baba's pole has started opening
 hone laga ek or dhongi kaa pardaafash
 In the capital Delhi, a hypocritical Baba who has been hypocritical in the name of devotion has been exposed
 aisa aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki dilli ke rohinee ilaake main is aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay main bholi-bhali ladakiyon or maasoom bacchiyon kaa aasthaa ke naam par saalon se shoshan ho rahaa tha
 That too under the government's nose
 magar khulaasa ab jaakar hua he
 In the garb of the ashram, this 'ram Rahim' of Ayyashidilli is named Virendra Dev Dixit
 jo khud ko aadhyatm guru kahata he
 The story of this Baba is very strange
 tamaam duusare baabaaon kii tarah ye khud ko bhagwaan kaa avatar to bataata hi he
 But it wanted to make sixteen thousand queens
 dilli jaise bade shahar main aasthaa ke naam par chal rahe ayyashi ke is khel kii puri kahani janenge to hairaani hogi
 Who is this Baba Virendra Dev Dixit
 ye jaanane ke liye sabase pehle iske ashram ke bare main jaaniye jiskaa naam he aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay
 Baba's story of Ayyashi started from here and seems to end here
 aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay kaa sachkhud ko bhagwaan bataane vaale is baba kaa sach kya he
 What happens inside this building known as his spiritual university
 ye tamaam sawaal zehan main uthte hai jab aap rohinee ke vijay vihaar ilaake main 'aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay' ke baahar panhuchate hai
 To know the same reality, Delhi Police Police, Women's Commission and High Court team had reached here
 iske baad vahaan shuru hua hangaamaa
 And now this crowd of hundreds of people is desperate to know the truth inside this building
 'bhatti' main jhokin jaati hai ladkiyancolony ke bich chaaron taraf se band is imaarat par baahar aadhyatmik vishvavidhyalay likhaa hua he
 But what happens inside the building, as many things as possible
 gupha ke andar 'bhatti' main jhokin jaati hai ladkiyaan!
 'pornography' is distributed in the ashram in the name of Prasad
 ashram main ladakiyonko diya jaataa he drugs
 When the truth of this spiritual university built in Rohini, capital of the country came to light, the ground slipped under the feet
 oonchi-oonchi deevaaron ke bich is uniwarsity main sex kaa khel chal rahaa tha
 It was messing with innocent girls
 kile kii tarah bane is vishvavidhyalay ko baba virendra dev dikshit chalaa rahaa tha
 We are not saying this, but the girls rescued from this university are saying
 bacchiyaan bhi ashram main kaidais imaarat ko chaaron ore se gril se jakadaaa gaya he
 Something has been gripped in such a way that no Parinda can kill even here
 is vishvavidhyalay ke baahar logon kii bheed juty hui he
 Many people, who are upset and crying in the crowd, have reached to take their daughters
 unka aarope he ki unki bacchiyon ko ashram main kaid kar liya gaya he
 The raids on the order of the High Court are facing charges of holding the minor girls and women hostage
 This spiritual university has been raided on the order of the Delhi High Court
 kai ladakiyon ko surakshit bhi nikaala gaya he
 The High Court had ordered the police to investigate the spiritual institution of North Delhi immediately
 santhaan par ek enjio ne ladakiyon or mahilaon ko usee dhang se bandhak banaakar rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya tha, jaise halaat haryana main gurmeet ram rahim ke ashram main dekhne ko mili the
 CBI will investigate Ayyashi Ashram, Delhi High Court expressed concern that it is very dangerous that women and girls are being held hostage in the name of faith
 philhal is maamle main do logon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Simultaneously, orders for CBI investigation have also been given
 haalanki ahm sawaal ye he ki aakhir kaise itane lambey samay se rajdhani dilli main is tarah ke aadhyatm ke naam par dhokhaa kiya ja rahaa tha
 But this is just the beginning, just like Baba Ram Rahim's Sirsa Dera, the stories behind the walls of this spiritual university are yet to be filtered out
 purv diggaj spinner anil kumble ne bhartiya cricket team ke coach pad se istipha de diya he
 Kumble gave this resignation due to a dispute with captain Virat Kohli
 anil kumble ke istife ke baad se hi kai tarah kii baaten saamne aa rahi hai, kai purv khilaadiyon ne kumble kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki team india anil jaise coach ke laayak nahin he
 But do you know when and why this dispute started between Virat and Kumble
 aaie is par ek najar daalate hai -1
 According to the news, the differences between Virat Kohli and Anil Kumble started from the series against Australia in March
 yah vivaad dharmashala test ke dauraan hua tha
 2
 viraat kohli chot ke kaaran is match kaa hissaa nahin the, or ajinkya rahane team ke captain the
 In this match, Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav was given a chance
 kohli iske khilaaf the, ve amit mishra ko khilaanaa chaahate the
 3
 media reports ke anusaar, yah faisla viraat ko bina bataae liya gaya tha, or plaing ilevan par nirnay liya gaya tha
 4
 iske alaava bataaya ja rahaa he ki viraat kohli purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ko grad-e main shaamil kiye jane se bhi khafa the
 5
 kohli kaa maananaa tha kyonki dhoni ab test cricket se sanyas le chuke hai, to unka grad-e main rahanaa sahi nahin he
 But coach Anil Kumble had a different opinion
 6
 It is said that coach Kumble was very strict about discipline in Team India
 kai maukon par vah practice ke dauraan khilaadiyon ko latad bhi laga chuke the
 At the same time, he was also against the girlfriends and wives of the team players on several rounds
 haalanki, is bare main kabhi unhone khulkar koi bayaan nahin diya
 7
 media reports kii maane, to coach ke taur par viraat kohli kii pehali pasand ravi shastri hai
 He was associated with Team India before Kumble as a director and coach
 unke alaava team ke kai khilaadi bhi shastri niti se khush the, khilaadi shastri ke khuli chhot dene ke ravaiye se khush the
 8
 champions trophy main pakistan ke haathon haar ke baad coach kumble or captain viraat ke bich sulajhata hua maamla phir ulajh gaya tha
 Virat openly objected to Kumble before the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) a day before the final
 jisase salaahkaar samiti pasopesh main thi
 
 
 
 is team ke saath to world cap jeetne se rahe viraat kohli?pak se haar or kumble ke istife se dukhi ek fain kaa khulaa khat- viraat bhai, aap to aise na the 21 days have passed since the academic session started in CBSE schools but till now CBSE books have not come in the market
 hairat kii baat ye bhi he ki kitabon kii dukaane khole skulon main bhi nahin ai hai
 This is not a new approach of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)
 barason se ye hi gathjod chal rahaa he, sibiesai or nijee prakashkon kaa
 In the market, the same books of private publishers are being sold indiscriminately in the name of guides, which CBSE will bring to market after few months
 tab tak shaayad aadha satr to nikal chukaa hoga
 NCERT (national Council of Educational Research and Training) prints most books for the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth
 yahi karikulam (vishay vastu) bhi taiyaar karata he
 cbseto maintains its breadth in English, Sanskrit, Computer Science, French, Disaster Management and Biotechnology
 nauveen se barahavin kii aath kitaaben angreji kii or chaar kitaaben computer science kii chhapata he
 Apart from this, Sanskrit Manika and Grammar of the ninth tenth, four in French, three in Disaster Management, two books of Biotechnology
 isamen hi itnaa bakhera ki puure desh main chaatro ke bich traahi-traahi much jaati he
 Earlier NCERT had the same condition, but now there is improvement
 jab bazaar yaa kahen nijee sarkari skulon tak kitaaben nahin pahunchi to avasarwaadi or gathjod vaale prakashkon ne apni kitaaben dugune daam par bazaar main utaar di hai
 People are also buying under compulsion, this happens every year
 kahawat bhi he ki jab asli sikke tijoriyon main band ho jate hai to nakli sikke bazaar main chalane lagate hai
 CBSE spokespersons also hoped that books would start going on the market in the next 15 days
 garmi kii chhuttiyaan tab tak honi shuru ho jaaengi
 CBSE schools will re-open in July
 skulon ko vyavsaayikta se mukt karne kaa farmaan to sibiesai ne suna diya
 Schools will not have uniforms, books and stationery shops or stalls
 lekin pustak mela ke naam par teen dinon kaa kitaab utsav manaane se to nahin roka gaya
 Schools will surround the parents by that route
 jab tak sibiesai is bare main jaagega kai satr nikal chuke honge
 Parents will take it right there under compulsion
 dimag kii lalabatti jab tak nahin utregi tab tak kaaron se laal batti utaarne kaa kya phayda
 
 sarkaar nishcint he
 Sent a letter, it will all be fixed
 alcon internation skool ke principal ashok pandeya ke mutabik abhibhavakon ko ham to suvidha muhaiyaa kara rahe hai
 Where to find books of different publishers
 so hamane sab ek hi jagah ek saath muhaiyaa kara rakhi hai
 On the other hand, Ramesh Vashist, secretary of the bookseller Hitkari Sangh, says that in January itself, the schools should put a list of books on their website, options for meeting places and uniform meeting places
 isse abhibhavakon ke aage vikalp rahenge
 Then whether parents take it from school or elsewhere
 skool mahasang sibiasaike is farmaan par adaalat jane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the bookseller Hitkari Sangh says that if this happens, we will also interfere and in favor of the guardians and publishers in the court, ignoring the decisions of the High Court and other courts in previous years
 adalati ladaai apni jagah he lekin philhal to chaatro ke aage samasya ye hi he ki class main shikshakon kii jhidki sunen
 The helplessness of the parents is that every two days, go to the bookstore and ask, brother, did the books of CBSE come? a loud voice comes from behind the counter "not now"

 bharat ko canada ke kamjor khel kaa phayda mila or 60wein minute main referi ne mejabaanon ko ek or penalty corner diya
 Varun did not make a mistake this time in converting the penalty corner and gave his team a 3-0 lead

 a party leader said that we are likely to benefit from the announcement of the Chief Ministerial candidate in Goa, unlike Punjab
 unhone kaha ki party ko gomes kii svachh chhavi se bhi ummiden hai
 On joining the Aam Aadmi Party, associated with Gomes AAP, in the same year, Gomes said that while staying in the government system, he saw and realized injustice from close quarters

 notebandi kii ghoshnako 8 november ko ek saal puraa ho rahaa he
 On this occasion, the government is preparing to celebrate the benefits caused by it
 modi sarkaar ke mutabik notebandi kaa ek phayda yah bhi hua ki ham cashles iconomi kii taraf bad rahe hai
 The government intends to strengthen the cashless economy even further
 sweden pehali cashles iconomihalankikashles iconomike sapane ko puri tarah hakeekat kaa rup dene se pehle modi sarkaar ko kuch hakeekat se rubaru hona jaruri he or iske liye modi sarkaar sweden kii taraf dekh sakati he, jo duniya kii pehali 100 fisadi cashles iconomi badhane kii taraf bad rahaa he
 More than 90 per cent of transactions in cash paid to the common man are cashless
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki sweden duniya kii pehali aisi arthvyavastha banane ja rahaa he, jahaan 100 fisadi cashles lenden hoga or nagdi kaa ansh nahin hoga
 There is another aspect of Sweden becoming cashless, which the common man is paying here
 cashles iconomi kaa bhaar aam aadmi ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 One has to pay for keeping money in the bank
 Chargesweden has been trying to mold itself as a cashless economy for many years, but it is proving a little difficult for the common people
 logon ko bank main apane paise rakhane ke liye charge dena pad rahaa he
 This is putting additional burden on the common man's pocket
 bharat main ye he notebandi kaa asarbhartiya bainkon kii baat karen, to inhone bhi bachat khaaton par byaaj dar main katautee shuru kar di he
 After demonetisation, many banks reduced the interest rate to 3
 50 fisadi tak kar di he
 Apart from this, the interest rate on fixed deposits has been cut
 iskaa sabase zyada asar un logon par pad rahaa he, jinka bachat kaa sabase bada saadhan epady or bachat khate hai
 Cyber-attackless transactions deal via electronic means
 isaki vajah se isko lekar sibar hamalon kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 We have heard reports of sbi's debit card and ATM hack of some banks in the last months
 aise main jab tak majboot sibar suraksha gheraa taiyaar nahin ho jaataa, tab tak cashles iconomi ke sapane ko saakaar karnaa kaaphi kharchila sabit ho saktaa he
 Shopkeepers do not take cash
 Outside many shops in cashswidan, you will find such boards written on which we do not accept cash
 sweden central bank ke ek survey ke mutabik yahaan 41 fisadi log 700 rupee se kam lenden ke liye aaj bhi cash ke hi istemaal karne ko tarjeeh dete hai
 It consists mostly of senior citizens and people who do not have much knowledge of digital transactions
 dukandaar nahin lenge cash to
 
 
 There is a large part of the population in India, which also needs the cooperation of another to withdraw money from atms
 digital lendenko lekar jo madhyam maujuud hai, vah aaj bhi unase anjaan hai
 In such a situation, the government should prepare people for it before creating a cashless society
 kyonki jis din dukaanon ne cash lenaa band kar diya, us din se cashles lenden na jaanane waalon ko sabase zyada dikkatein pesh aaengi
 Infrastructure: To realize the dream of a cashless economy, India will not only have to work on financial awareness, but will also have to create strong infrastructure for it
 bhale hi modi sarkaar lagaataar cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene main juty hui he, uske baavjood kai dukaanon ke paas aaj bhi pioes mashine nahin hai
 For cashless societies, strengthening financial awareness and infrastructure should be a priority

 shastri ne kaha, agar world cricket kii baat karen to koi bhi team aisi nahin he jo apane videshi dauron par zyada kamyaabi hasil kar rahi ho, khaskar jab test maichon kii baat aati he
 If you see a team that has been doing well in the last two years, it is India
 team india ke liye videshi daure mujhe ek chunauti ke rup main lagata he, kyonki koi team acchhee tarah se yatra nahin karti he or is team ko ek aisi team banane kaa mauka mil rahaa he, jo acchhee tarah se yatra kar sake
 Shastri said, if you look at the performance of Team India in the last two-three years, then they have defeated England in the ODI series
 australia ko twanti -20 siries main 3-0 se haraaya he, hamane srilanka ko lagaataar do baar test siries main maat di he
 When you work hard, the results are also good

 He decided to show the life of an unhappy Tawaif
 phir uski life main ek kunvaara kam umr aashiq aae or donon duniya kii tamaam buree takaton or yakeenon se ladate hue apana ashiana banaaen or phir bachaaen
 To give more hue in the story, some characters of eunuchs were put in, so that in the name of manhood, the woman had to slap more in the mouths of the marketers
 is tarah kahani puri hui
 The gentleman inside the brother awakened and he realized that it had nothing to do with it
 ve bhul gaye or kissa bhoot ho gaya
 Then after twenty thirty years this ghost rode on Vishwas Patil
 unhen is kahani kaa ilm hua
 Decided to make a live film
 actress kangana ranot ke paas pahunche
 Playing the role of Tawaif Rajjo on the screen is very challenging, Kangana agreed with this learning
 bataate hai ki apane role ko asal dikhaane ke vaaste unhone kai kothon main jaakar veshyaaon or naachne waaliyon ko kareeb se dekha or samajha
 The youngsters auditioned for the role of Ashik Chandu and pinned the needle on Paras Arora who played the lead in the serial Veer Siva Ji
 hijadon ke mukhiya begum ke role main film vastav se vaastavik sambhaavnaaen jagaakar phir gum ho gaye diarector or actor mahesh manjrekar ko liya gaya or lead villen bhande bhai ke role ke liye aae ection filmon ke comic krur khalanaayak prakaash raaj
 Even in reading, the film seems to be growing on the right path, but believe it is very funny and ripe
 itani ki jo puri film dekhegaa, wo apana naam kisi veerta puraskaar ke liye bhej saktaa he
 The story of the film is a mockery of a katla in the name of the story
 chandu cricketer he or hormonium bhi acchhee bachaata he
 The father is a professor
 ek din match jitata he apni team ko to car gairaaj chalaane vaala uskaa adhed dost or team spancer use maje karaane ke liye kothe par le pahunchataa he
 Here Chandu meets Rajjo who dances with a lot and is stuck here due to the situation
 halaat kya
 Also listen to this
 ek pahari gaanv kii pyaari si bacchee thi, jise uski sagi bahan or jija mumbai le aae or ek hijde begum ko bech diya kuch paison ke liye, taaki ve mumbai main flats kharid saken
 However, Chandu Rajjo meets and falls in love
 phir ek tuntpujie samajasevi ke vichaaron ke aaveg main aakar donon byaah kar lete hai
 Begum, who beat Rajjo on the matter, does not object to this
 udhar ek dance baar ke jariye or paise kamaane kii aas main rajjo kaa maldaar graahak bhande bhaau jab uske liye kothe par pahunchataa he, to pataa chalata he ki rajjo to gai byaah karke
 He gets angry
 udhar ghar waalon se tiraskaar jhel rahe ye pyaar ke panchi ek gramin se shahari ilaake main nae sire se jindagi sanvaarane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Then the war of love begins
 vaise ladaai aap bhi lard rahe hote hai ram ram kar is film ke puure hone ke intjaar main
 Kangana Ranot is very artificial and raw in the role of Rajjo
 unke chehre par bhav is teji se badalte hai ki aap samvednaa ke bajaay sitpita se jate hai
 Paras Arora is a staunch child and if he tries on TV now, better
 mahesh manjrekar ko bekaar main kharch diya gaya
 Seeing Prakash Raj in such a roll makes one feel drowsy
 gane ke naam par ek julmi re julmi he, jisamen kangana se aise naach karavaaya ja rahaa he, kores girls ke saath, goyaa kisi film aword ke sho ke manch par thumake lag rahe hon
 The rest are Joe, So are and contribute their share in a terrifying film
 agar aapako lagata he ki aapmen dhairya kuta kuta kar bharaa he or is yogic divine gun kaa imtihaan lenaa chaahate hai, to rajjo jarur dekhie
 The film has been given half a star for the immense courage and patience with which so many people made this film

 We all know that the Earth's only satellite is the Moon, but scientists say that there were probably two Earth's moons earlier and one of these smaller sized moons collided with the larger one
 khagolavidon ne kaha ki shaayad yah is takkar kaa hi parinaam he ki maujuuda chandramaa ke donon hisse ek duusare se bilkul alag hai
 He says that the nearest part of the moon is low and flat, while the far part is mountainous and high
 samachar patr daily mail ke mutabik vaigyanikon kii raay is bare main alag-alag he
 a new theory has been given about the fact that the collision of two moons has caused the height of a portion of the existing moon to become smaller
 unka kahana he ki donon chandramaaon main takkar dhire-dhire hui
 In such a situation, it is possible that those mountains have been built, which we see today in the distant part of the moon

 this act is performed by a professional ' This disclaimer must flash whenever Dhoni does his own stuff for runouts! The audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was kept in Parliament on the last day of the sixteenth Lok Sabha term, which was awaited for a long time
 sieji kii report ne modi sarkaar ke 2016 main 36 rafel ladaaku jahaajon kii kharid ke liye 60,000 karod ru
 Audited the deal
 report ne sarkaar par lagaae vipaksh ke un aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya ki sarkaar ne france se jo jahaaj kharide hai, uske liye pichhali sarkaar se tay keemat se zyada rakam chukaai he
 The report has brought a major relief to the government ahead of the May 2019 general elections
 sieji ne report main ullekh kiya ki 2007 or 2014 ke bich saat saal main upie ne saudebaaji ke baad jo keemten tay kii thim, maujuuda sarkaar ke kharide gaye jahaaj uski tulana main bhi 2
 86 percent are cheap
 haalanki report modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ke us daawey ko bhi atiranjit bataati he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is sarkaar ne 2016 kii vaarta main rafel kii jo keemten tay kin, ve pichhali sarkaar kii tay keemat se 9 pratishat kam hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has dismissed this report as a 'cover-up' report protecting the government
 unke mutabik, ''is saude main bank guarantee nahin he or report main us guarantee kii laagat kii andekhi kii gai he
 At the same time, the cost of the changes made keeping India in mind is also suspiciously high
 ''pichley saal 14 disambar ko supreme court kii ore se mili sakaaratmak faisle ke baad ab sieji kii report, modi sarkaar ke liye ek or sanjivani ke rup main ai he
 Responding to four pils, the apex court had said that there was no reason to doubt the government's purchase of Rafale jet
 sarkaar ne gopneeyata kaa hawala dete hue iskaa khulaasa karne se inkaar kar diya tha ki puri tarah se las rafel ke liye usne kitna bhugtan kiya
 The Supreme Court had taken details of Rafale prices in sealed envelopes from the government
 sieji ne bhi gopneeyata banaae rakhi or keval keemton or pichley saude se is saude main laagat ke antar kaa pratishat ke rup main ullekh kiya he
 The CAG signed the UPA government's tender for Medium multi-role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA), in which Rafael was at the forefront, and the NDA-2 government's inter-governmental agreement in 2015, with the Modi government canceling the UPA agreement directly in France
 Decided to buy 36 flyaway Rafaels from the government, investigating both
 congress kaa daawa he ki uskaa sauda behatar tha kyonki 108 jahaaj license ke tahat bharat main hi banaae jane the
 The nature of the two deals was different
 is vajah se keemton ko lekar sieji zyada chaukas he
 Its report says that the 2007 and 2015 offering had its own difficulties in comparison to the prices under offer as the 2007 deal included license production prices while the 2015 offering only included the acquisition of 'ready to fly' aircraft made in France
 is
 is saal janvari main raksha mantralay ne sieji ko bataaya tha ki usne upie ke kaarykaal main hue saude se 9 pratishat kam keemton par rafel kharidne kaa sauda kiya tha
 However, the CAG found that savings only 2
 86 pratishat kii thi
 This figure is primarily based on changes made in India at high altitudes such as cold start, tow decoy array (the ability to dodge aircraft piercing missiles) and electronic warfare systems that make Rafael unique to India
 , 17 in
 08 pratishat kii kami ke madhyam se aayaa
 The CAG said that if the Ministry of Defense had bargained a little more with Dasso Aviation, especially with regard to bank guarantees, then some more money could have been saved
 2007 kii apni peshkash ke vipareet daso ne 2015 main koi bank guarantee nahin di thi
 This guarantee was for 15 percent advance payment which would remain outstanding till the delivery of the ships started
 saudebaaji ke liye gaye bhartiya dal ke naukarshahon ne bhi bank guarantee nahin hone par aapatti kii thi, jise khaarij kar diya gaya
 The CAG has also mentioned a point like the absence of a sovereign guarantee raised by the Law Ministry as Rs 36,000 crore
 laagat kaa lagbhag 60 pratishat bharat sarkaar daso ko pehle hi bhugtan kar chuki he
 The government has just received a letter of comfort from the French government which is not legally binding
 haalanki report is baat kaa jawaab nahin de paati ki praudyogiki ke hastantaran ke saath bhartiya vaayu sena kii 126 ladaaku jahaajon (saat squadran) kii jarurat kab or kaise france main hi taiyaar 36 ladaaku jahaajon kii ekamusth kharid main badal gai
 The CAG report says, "the audit has not revealed any other proposal with the ministry to fill this wide gap in the operational preparedness of the Indian Air Force
" '' raksha mantralay ne sieji ko bataaya tha ki usne jahaajon kii kami kaa faasla paatane ke liye ranneetik saajhedaari ke tahat single-ingine ladaaku jahaajon ke liye aapurtikartaaon se prastaav kii sharten rakhi thim
 The Air Force was looking for 126 light combat aircraft for 19 years
 yah sankhya kam kyon kii gai, jis par ki vivaad he, report is par maun he
 However, it also questions the procurement process under which Rafael emerged as the winner in 2012, beating out various suppliers
 sieji kii tippanee he ki paanch saal kii saudebaaji ke dauraan rafel ke liye daso kii boli ko kai baar ayogy tehra diya janaa chahie tha
 The deal was saved every time by concessions from the Ministry of Defense
 2012 main daso ko sabase kam boli lagane vaala ghoshit karne ke turant baad hi isaki mulya nirdhaaran prakriya main gadbaditon kii shikaayatein shuru ho gai thim
 a committee for inquiry was formed, which in March 2015 submitted the report to the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar
 isane chah sansanikhej nishkarsh die—daso vaayu sena kii gunatmak jaruraton kaa anupaalan nahin karata or use takneekee moolyankan ke charan main hi ayogy ghoshit kiya janaa chahie tha; boli pesh karne kii taarikh bitne ke baad daso ke atirikt vyavsaayik prastaavon kii sweekruti 'vittiya swaamitv ke siddhant ke viruddh' thi
 Dasa's dialect was not in the prescribed format
 chunki daso 'el1' yaa sabase kam boli lagane vaala nahin tha, so uske saath anubandh nahin ho saktaa tha
 Eurofighter's proposal also does not comply with the terms of the proposal
 madhyam bahuupayogi ladaaku jahaaj ke prastaav kii sharton (mmrsie arpeef) ko hataa diya gaya or sarkaar ne 2016 main tatkaal aapurti kharid kaa vikalp chunaa
 The CAG noted that Rafael was first rejected by the Technical Evaluation Committee in May 2008
 yah 2012 main aakhirkaar rafel ko chune jane se pehle hue kai avishwasaneey sanyogon main se pehla tha
 In 2009, Rafael was again rejected on the grounds that it did not meet the needs of the Air Force
 report kahati he ki may 2009 main tatkaaleen raksha mantri ne gunvattta jaruraton main pherbadal par chhot ko manjuuri di
 The CAG believes that this is a violation of the fixed procedure (DPP) for any capital defense procurement by the Ministry of Defense
 sieji ne kaha ki raksha mantralay ke baad ke javaabon main kaha gaya he ki chunki raksha adhigrahan parishad (dissi) ne dipipi main maamuli badlaavon ko manjuuri de di he isliye ise dipipi kaa ulanghan nahin mana jayega
 The note in the report says, "that's why Dasso Aviation's proposal was accepted
 '' rafel ke 14 gunvattta jaruraton main vifal hone par raksha mantralay ne takneekee gaiyr-anupaalan se jude faislon ko vaarta samiti par chhod diya
 The CAG commented that it was 'unfair'
 antim aapurtikartaaon ke rup main rafel or eurofiter typhone ko chunaa gaya lekin unki boliyaan form or nishchit laagton kaa ullekh na karne kii vajah se anupaalan yogya nahin pai gayi
 The CAG commented that "therefore their bids were eligible to be rejected as non-responsive bids
" '' par aisa kuch bhi nahin hua
 The Ministry of Defense started bargaining over prices on the basis of which it could be decided which of the two aircraft was cheaper
 2012 main isane rafel or eurofiter, donon kii mulya boliyaan kholin
 Rafael was found to be a low price bidder and hence the Ministry of Defense formed a contract negotiation committee to discuss the price
 yah paaya gaya ki taiyarshuda vimaan ke liye raksha mantralay kii nirdhaarit benchmark keemat sabase kam boli lagane vaale rafel kii vaastavik keemat se 47 pratishat kam he
 Although the French jet was found cheaper, there was a big bag here
 or sieji kii report kaa yahi sabase zyada ghaatak hissaa he
 According to the CAG, Dasso calculated the cost of manufacturing Rafale in India according to man hours in French industry
 apane utpaada kii bharat main keemat kii gananaa ke liye use apane maanav ghante main 2
 Multiply by a factor of 7
 aisa kiya gaya hota to rafel sabase sasta na hota
 The Eurofighter would have cost less and would have been the cheapest
 yahaan tak ki 2007 main daso kii lagaai boli us praaroop main nahin thi jisamen keemton ke moolyankan ke liye saat vistrut laagat tatv shaamil the
 The manufacturers of the Eurofighter stated prices following that format
 daso ne keval do hisson main laagat bataai-sidhe france se banakar aae udaye ko taiyaar jahaajon kii keemat or praudyogiki hastantaran kii keemat (tioti)
 These issues are important issues raised by the CAG regarding the change in terms, most of which took place during the Congress-led UPA government
 congress kaa ek aarope yah bhi he ki endie ke rafel saude main udyogpati anil ambani ko anuchit laabh pahunchane kii koshish hui or unhen puure saude main se 30,000 karod ru
 Offset of haalanki, sieji ne daso-reliance airospes limited (diareel) ke ofaset sahit 100 se zyada ofaset bhagidaaron main se kisi kaa bhi ullekh nahin kiya he
 This is because work on these offsets will start from September 2019, three years after the signing of the deal
 sieji kii report khaarij karne or rahul gandhi ke 'chaukeedaar chor he' jaise bayaan jari rakhane ke sanketon ke saath, rafel kii bahes ab ek aisi bahes prathit hoti he jo aam chunaavon main chai rahegi
 Strathafel's Ragadag CAG report recounts a number of irrational decisions of the Ministry of Defense between 2007 and 2014 that kept Rafael at the forefront of the procurement of fighter ships
 Failed to complete jabaki anya chaar daavedaar—eurofiter typhone, gripen, epa-16 or epa-18 keval chaar aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne main naakaam rahe the
 2009: Ministry of Defense exempts Rafael from following quality requirements and requests for conditions of proposal (RFP)
 rafel ke liye raksha kharid prakriya ke ulanghan kii anumati di gai, jo keval 'maamuli' vichlan kii anumati detaa he na ki '14 maapdandon main badlaav kar dene kii
 2010: Rafael fails to meet 14 criteria related to quality requirements
 mahanideshak adhigrahan kaa kahana he ki inamen se teen maapdandon par anubandh vaarta samiti (siensi) ko baatcheet kerani chahie
 2011: Bids of both Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon do not disclose the firm and fixed prices that are mandated in the RFP and may be technically disqualified for this reason
 haalanki, kharid kii prakriya phir bhi jari he
 2012: The lowest bidder was found in the bids for the Rafale MMRCA (medium multi-role Combat Aircraft)
 kaig kaa kahana he ki daso ne nirdhaarit praaroop main laagat boli jamaa nahin kii
 The Life Cycle Cost was not calculated correctly because Dasso did not bid for the capital expenditure associated with setting up the plant for production under the ship's license
 2012: daso ne bharat main license praapt vimaanon ke utpaadan kii laagat kii gananaa francisi maanav ghanton kaa upyog karke kii
 CNC ignored this, estimating the benchmark price and the lowest bidder
 2015: tatkaaleen raksha mantri manohar parrikar ko saunpi gai raksha mantralay kii report main vibhinn aniyamittaaon kii suchi di gai heru daso sabase kam boli lagane vaala nahin tha or isliye iske saath anubandh nahin hona chahie tha
 The lowest bid count was faulty
 rafel ne bhartiya vaayu sena kii jaruraton kaa anupaalan nahin kiya he or takneekee moolyankan charan main hi use ayogy ghoshit kiya janaa chahie tha
 Additional commercial offers were accepted by Dasso after the bid submission dates, which were unprecedented and against the treaty tradition of financial ownership

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appeared in full action after he finished the sit-in from the Lt
 Governor's office
 ghar lautate hi aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon or kaaryakartaaon se mukhaatib hue kejariwal ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko ab dilli main purna rajya ke darje ko lekar taiyaari karne ke nirdesh die hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, who has been targeting social media for the past 9 days, from LG Anij Baijal to PM Narendra Modi, ended the picket with his minister Gopal Rai and reached the CM residence at 6 Flag Staff Road
 yahaan pehle se hi vidhayakon or party netaaon kii baithak chal rahi thi
 During this, Arvind Kejriwal addressed the workers and discussed further strategies
 sabhi dalon ne diya samarthandharane kaa anubhav saajha karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, 'pichley 9 din kaa anubhav acha rahaa, aaj sabhi kii jeet hui he
 Except bjp-congress, all parties in the country supported, for which we are thankful to them
 jo kaam 4 mantri alji daphtar ke andar nahin kar pate, baahar aap logon ne karishma kar dikhaaya he'
 Kejriwal told the workers that now Delhi has to get the status of full state, get ready for this struggle
 aage kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli kaa dhaancha ajeeb he, yahaan sarkaar ko koi power nahin he
 During Sheila Dixit's time, Delhi was half the state, but now PM Modi has made Delhi a 10 percent state
 thodi bahut power thi wo bhi chin lee, na purna rajya kaa darja diya
 This revealed to the whole country that the Modi government is strangling democracy
 pradhanmantri par aarope lagaate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki wo dilli kaa kaamkaaj thap karana chaahate hai
 In Delhi, the Prime Minister is going on strike by IAS officers which is sad
 unhone kaha ki ham koi hindustan-pakistan nahin isi desh ke log hai
 Our ideology may be different but politics should not be with the people of the country
 ek phone se hadtaal khatm
 
 
 During this, Kejriwal also gave a strange reason for ending the strike
 unhone kaha ki aaj adhikariyon kii hadtaal kaise khatm hui? darasal ek phone kol gaya alji offis se ki meeting main jaao
 After this, the strike was over within a minute, no meeting was needed
 lekin dilli ke uparajyapal kaa hadtaal karwaanaa ek galat baat he
 Arvind Kejriwal praised the IAS officers, calling the dharna a small victory
 kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaare iees afasar bahut achche hai
 The work of electric water could be done only through the officers, but the officers are threatened by the LG residence and they are prevented from working
 rajasthan main pehle charan ke loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar buudhvaar se namakan shuru ho gaya he lekin bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke ghar ke andar aisi mahabharat machi he ki abhi bhi 6 loksabhaa siton par ummidavaar tay nahin ho paa rahe hai
 The ruling Congress of the state has decided the names of all its 25 Lok Sabha candidates but there is no consensus between the central leadership and Vasundhara Raje for 6 seats inside the BJP
 sutron kaa kahana he ki sabase zyada vivaad dausa, dhaulpur- karauli seat ko lekar he
 Meena caste leader and Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena may return to BJP before the assembly elections, but Vasundhara Raje does not like her
 bijepi ke kendriya netritv or purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke bich abhi bhi asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he
 The BJP is unable to decide how to field a candidate from the likes of Kirori Lal Meena or Vasundhara Raje
 naam par asahmatiaisi baat saamne aa rahi he ki vasundhara raaje kirodi laal meena ke ghor virdohi or nirdaleey vidhayak om prakaash hudla kii patni ko dausa se chunaav main khadaa karnaa chaahati hai, lekin is naam par sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 Significantly, due to the opposition of Kirori Lal Meena, Om Prakash Hoodla could not get a ticket from Mahua in last year's assembly elections, due to which he fielded as an independent candidate and won
 haalanki baad main vah bijepi ke saath aa gaye
 Harish Chandra Meena, BJP MP from Dausa, has joined the Congress and has become an MLA
 isi tarah se rajsamand loksabhaa seat ko lekar vasundhara raaje or bijepi ke kendriya netritv bich vivaad bana hua he
 a section of the BJP wants to nominate former Jaipur princess Diya Kumari from there, while Vasundhara Raje wants a local person to be given a ticket
 rajsamand loksabhaa seat se saansad hariom singh rathod ne elaan kar diya he ki vah swasthya kaarnon se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai
 Barmer and Nagaur are also stuck
 Two big Jat seats for the seat of BJP, Barmer and Nagaur also remain a sore throat
 jaisalmer loksabhaa seat se saansad karnal sonaaram barmer se vidhansabha chunaav haar gaye the, lihaaja inako badalane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 IPS Mahendra Chaudhary has taken VRS to fight from there, but Vasundhara Raje's opposing camp wants Sonaram to be brought down from Barmer once again as only Sonaram can contest Manvendra Singh
 nagaur seat par kendriya mantri siaar choudhary kaa virodh chal rahaa he
 Many mlas of Vasundhara Raje are opposing CR Chaudhary
 aise main kaha ja rahaa he ki rajasthan ke jhagade se sheersh netritv itnaa pareshaan ho chukaa he ki unase kah diya gaya he ki jaipur main faisla kar naamon kii elaan kar de
 For Nagaur seat it is also being said that BJP leaders have also held talks with National Democratic Party MLA Hanuman Beniwal

 Let me tell you, in the trailer, Kartik Aaryan is telling his friend Aparshakti Khurana, 'if we ask for sex from your wife, then we beggar, if we refuse sex to your wife, then if we get tortured and somehow get sex from her by juggling We are also rapists
 '“aur kisi tarah biwi se sex haasil kar le, toh balaatkaari bhi hum” Joking about marital rape is not okay
 # patipatniaurwoh # patipatniaurwohthis misogyny needs to end! a woman's power to consent is not something to joke about and what makes it worse is that 20-something year olds are being part of such projects
 # patipatniaurwoh # Hindifilmindustry # maritalrapekarwika aryan (kartik Aaryan) ke is dialog par sawaal khadaa karte hueek twitor yujar ne likhaa, 'kya 'pati patni or wo (pati Patni Aur Woh)' film kaa dialog marital rape kaa bachaav kar rahaa he

 bihar board intermediatpariksha2018 ke nattejey buudhvaar kii shaam ghoshit kar die gaye
 Talking about the Faculty of Science, this time Kalpana Kumari, who was the NEET topper across the country, also topped the 12th Science Faculty of Bihar Board and got 434 marks
 haalanki, kalpana kumari ke bihar board kevigyansankay main top karne kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad ek bada vivaad shuru ho gaya, jisko lekar bihar vidhyalay pariksha samiti ne jhooth bolkar apni izzat bachaane main behatari samajhi
 The dispute did not arise about Kalpana Kumari's knowledge but about the poor education system of Bihar and the Bihar Board
 desh ke kisi skool kii baat karen to yah bahut aam si baat he ki agar aap 10veen yaa 12veen board kii pariksha main baithte hai, to aapako kaksha main nunatam upasthiti hona anivaary hota he
 In many places, the minimum attendance for students is 75 per cent
 bavaal magar isliye uthaa he, kyonki bihar board ne is baar ek aisi chaatra ko vigyaan sankaay kaa topper bana diya, jisane kabhi apane skool main class kaa munh tak nahin dekha
 In fact, soon after topping the NEET exam last week, Kalpana Kumari told in an interview in many places that she was preparing for medical for the last 2 years from Akash Institute in Delhi
 isi dauraan bihar board se 12veen kii pariksha dene ke liye kalpana ne apane grih jila shivahar ke tariyani main sthit YKJM college main daakhila bhi liya hua tha
 Kalpana had filled the Bihar board form from this college to take the 12th board examination
 is pariksha ke vigyaan sankaay main vah top kar gayi
 In such a situation, the question arises that when Kalpana was preparing for medical from Akash Institute in Delhi for the last 2 years, then how was she registering minimum attendance in the class of college of Shivhar? Questions arose on the Bihar board that when the attendance of a student in a school is less than the minimum or it is non-existent, then such a student should appear in the Bihar board examination How permitted Atne? Seeing the controversy escalating, Bihar School Examination Committee chairman Anand Kishore lied and tried to end the whole controversy
 anand kishor ne aanan-fanan main yah elaan kar diya ki bihar ke skulon main kisi bhi chaatr ke liye nunatam upasthiti kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 This means that you can only enroll in a government school in Bihar or in any school recognized by the board of Bihar, do not take classes and also give the board exam comfortably and top it
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki jab anand kishor is baat kaa elaan kar rahe hai ki bihar ke skulon main nunatam upasthiti kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Then why has the state government opened more than 70 thousand schools in the state and what is the point of restoring teachers in these schools? The question also arises that when there is no provision for minimum attendance for students, then why do crores of rupees are spent on education every year ? Bihar has probably become the only state in the country where there is no provision for minimum attendance for students in government schools
 yani chaatr skool aae naa aae koi fark nahin padataa, bas pariksha main baith jaaie or top kar jaaie
 The conclusion of this dispute is that Kalpana Kumari is not a fake student by any means, but she is really a topper, but she has once again exposed the bad education system of Bihar
 pichley 2 saalon se lagaataar topper ghotaale kii vajah se badanaami jhel rahe bihar vidhyalay pariksha samiti ne is baar ek aisa jhooth bolaa he jiske baad uski or zyada badanaami ho rahi he
 In Badaun, the victim's family has been surprised by the report of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the case of the bodies of two minor cousins hanging from the tree, according to which it is not a case of rape and murder, but a case of suicide

 The family wants the truth to be revealed and the culprits are punished
 mritak ladakiyon main se ek ke pita ne kaha ki sibiai ne ladki or gaanv ke hi ek ladke ke bich premaprasang kii jo kahani sunai he, vah gale se neeche nahin utarati
 Since the investigating agency has not been able to explain why the other teenager committed suicide if they had a love affair
 graminon kaa daawa he ki donon kishoriyaan kisi baat ko lekar tanaav main nahin thim
 a family member said, "suicide is a completely fabricated story"
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki kishoriyaan bhala 20 phute oonche aam ke ped par kaise chadh gayi? The verbal war has erupted after this CBI report

 Sibal, one of the representatives of the government in the 10-member draft committee, however, clarified that the government will take a decision on the issue only after the draft of the bill goes to the cabinet

 When Rahul Gandhi said that he was ready to take all possible steps to stop his mother from becoming Prime Minister, what did he really want to say? Tell me, to what extent could he go? Is there any kind of violence in it Or the matter of busting
 ve bahut chintit the
 He said that you know, my grandmother was murdered, my father was murdered and i suspect that if my mother becomes Prime Minister, she will be murdered within six months
 unhone jo kaha he, ve uske khilaaf nahin ja saktin or samajhadaari bhi isi main thi
 For this i give full numbers to Rahul that he prevented his mother from doing work that could threaten her life
 lekin koi satta kaa itnaa virdohi he to congress party kaa netritv kaise kar saktaa he?ye donon alag mudde hai
 Why? It happened in 2004
 ve party ke upaadhyaksh nahin the, party main koi or pad unke paas nahin tha
 It was a matter between mother and son
 unhone satta kii bajaae maa ke jivan ko praathamikta di
 But tell me, to what extent could they go? As you have written that Sonia had tears in her eyes? You know that Rahul is a very strong-willed man
 or unki raay bahut thos hoti he, bhale hi unhen apana jivan daanv par lagaana pade
 Are you trying to say that he had threatened that he could even take his own life? No, he did not say so
 lekin yah ekadam spasht tha ki ve apni maa kii jaan khatre main nahin daalane denge
 Do you believe that Sonia and Priyanka were worried about the book for that reason? Yes
 yah mukhya vajah he?haa, yahi vajah he
 Only three or four people know about this
 jaisaa aapane kaha, agar yah ateet kii baat he to isse unhen chintaa kyon honi chahie? yah to ek bete kii apni maa ke prati chintaa hi darshata he
 You should ask this only to them
 lekin sonia or priyanka yahaan ai thim
 He made any indication as to why this book should not be published? Sometime around 15 or 20 April Suman Dubey, my friend and good man, called me for lunch
 uske turant baad priyanka kaa phone aayaa, “main aap se mil sakati hum?” maine kaha, “kal aaen, saath coffee pite hai
 "so Priyanka came and said," My mother sent me to talk about the book to you
 aap kya likhane ja rahe hai?” mere liye yah mushkil kaam tha
 i have known this family since 1944
 maine priyanka se kaha, “tum jaanati ho, sach aakhir sach hota he or hameshaa sach rahata he” maine priyanka se kaha ki pichley 8-10 saal main congress or unki maa ne mere saath kya kiya he
 Sonia came a short time later
 maine kaha, bharat ke alaava duniya ke kisi bhi desh ne volkar report par dhyaan nahin diya
 He set up a Pathak Inquiry Committee which acquitted me and said that there is no evidence that Natwar Singh personally benefited from the financial dealings
 maamla yaheen khatm ho janaa chahie tha lekin aisa hua nahin
 i continued to be harassed
 sonia kaa jawaab tha ki unhen is bare main jaankaree nahin he
 i said that no one would believe it
 congress main aisa kuch nahin ghatata jisaki jaankaree aapako na ho
 Even the leaf does not move
 vah mulaakaat bahut acchhee rahi or main bahut hi shaleenta se pesh aayaa
 Every day she came, that is, on 7 May, after that the attitude of Congressmen changed towards you? Yes, in many people
 mere saale amardinr (singh) or main da oberoi main lunch kar rahe the
 Digvijay Singh came there with his family and started asking when your book is coming out
 main sonia gandhi ke saath roj ghanton baat karata tha
 Used to talk to him on every subject in the world — on every subject, including Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky
 ham itane kareeb the ki ve mujhase vah baat bhi kar letin jo rahul or priyanka se nahin kar paatin
 For him, coming to my house was like surrendering in a way
 kitaab baahar aane ke baad aapako kya ummid he?main kah nahin saktaa
 Maybe they go to court
 lekin mujhe parvaah nahin
 Rahul will be the most affected
 unke saath aapke sambandh kaise hai?main unhen tab se jaanata hum, jab ve bachche the
 There is a lot of age difference between us
 yah antar to priyanka se bhi kaaphi he
 Yes, but i have met Priyanka more than Rahul
 udhaaharan ke taur par ek din jab ham unki maa ke dringroom main baithe the to priyanka boleen, “meri maa ne aapako bataaya ki main duusari baar maa banane ja rahi hum
 "and Rahul came in and said," Can you make a mistake in my great-grandfather? " i would reply, "this is a difficult task
 ve mere hero hai or main unki puja karata hum
 "but everything changed after the Volcker report came out
 main tab francfort main tha
 i saw the news in which a Congress spokesperson said that the Congress is clean but Natwar Singh should improve himself
 main gusse main tha or ummid kar rahaa tha ki shaayad sonia is bare main kuch nahin jaanati hongi
 Those people told Sonia that they (I) are so close to you, people will say that you have given them money
 lekin paisa kahin tha hi nahin
 i do not know who took the money
 mujhe isamen dilchaspee bhi nahin he
 After this, documents of 70,000 pages were taken by Virender Dayal but he was never shown to the Pathak Committee
 jab main pathak se mila to unase poocha ki un dastavejon kaa kya hua? unka jawaab tha ki yah ek lambii kahani he
 You believe that the money went to the Congress
 congress main kis ke paas?koi nahin jaanata
 If you look at the attachment of the Volcker Report, it is known that Congress has been mentioned till 1997
 meraa naam march, 2005 main shaamil kiya gaya
 The Volcker report was to expose the misdeeds of UN (UN) officials, especially the son of the secretary-general
 ab ve sab batch gaye or maine kuch kiya hi nahin
 Madam Sonia said that i have to be implicated in this matter
 aapako kis liye thik karnaa tha
 You know, they don't like disobedience
 aapane kis tarah avagya kii?main dusron kii tarah unase milane nahin gaya or unase yah nahin kaha ki mujhe maaf kiijie, aap mujhase naaraaz kyon hai?aktubar, 2005 main jab aap francfort se waapas aae to unase mili nahin?main unase kisi tarah ke samvaad kii ummid kar rahaa tha ki ve puuchhen “yah sab kya ho rahaa he?” or main apni taraf se spashtikaran detaa
 If you talk about practicality, that would have been a wise move but for me it had become a moral issue
 jab unhone mujhase raksha saude ke bare main sawaal kiya tab bhi maine jawaab diya, “aap meri eemaandaaree par shaq kar rahi hai, jo mujhe manjuur nahin he
 "but apart from that there are many good memories
 jab meri beti kaa nidhan hua to ve kai din tak mere ghar aati raheen
 She used to come to the hospital every day when i had bypass surgery
 main kai baar unase miltaa, sirf gapbaajee ke liye
 We used to discuss books
 ve bahut padhaaku hai, maine gabriel garsia markege kii kitaab van handred iers of solitude ke bare main pehle kabhi nahin suna tha
 Sonia told me after reading that book
 ham bahut-si kitabon kii adla-badali karte the
 One aspect of his personality is very good
 kya he vah?ve maanati hai ki main bahut vivekshil vyakti hum or apane parivaar ke prati samarpit hum
 So they come to my house and open it
 kai baar sharmaa jaati hai or unke dimple gahare ho jate hai
 His sense of humor is very amazing
 unhen gap-shap pasand he? aasapaas kii ghatnaon ke bare main ve jaananaa chaahati hai?ve har cheez ke bare main jaanati hai
 Rahul comes to a place in your book, along with a puppy who chews the book
 aap kii unke bare main yahi raay he?mujhe ve bahut achche lagate hai
 They are very good human beings
 ve kuch kar dikhaaenge
 On what basis are they saying? Hereditary qualities are in them
 ve rajnatik parivaar main paley hai
 He is a man of modern thought
 aap se unhone kabhi raay nahin lee
 AAP had become unacceptable ever since he became active in the party
 main jawaharlal nehru memorial fund kaa aaajeevan trustee hum
 So they meet in four or five months
 sonia bhi vahaan aati hai lekin main unase baat nahin karata
 Just empty condition
 aapane ek dinar kaa hawala diya tha jisamen unhone aap se baat nahin kii
 She was sitting there
 main bhi vahaan tha
 The President of Czechoslovakia was also sitting there, and he did not even talk to one of us while at other dinner parties we used to laugh a little
 main kuch mjedaar baaten likhata, ve use padhakar apane purse main rakh letin
 Such a relationship was not with anyone else
 yah sambandh guru-shishyaa jaisaa tha yaa doston jaisaa?guru shabd to bahut bada ho jaataa he
 We were very good friends
 umr main kaaphi antar ke baavjood?haa
 There is a sentence in the book, no Indian could do what they did
 haa, yah ekadam sahi he
 What do you mean by this? They are very strict inside
 jo bhartiya mahilaon jaisaa gun nahin he
 For example, an Indian will not treat a person older than himself, the tradition in our country is that you respect elders, do not misbehave
 aisa vyavhaar sirf mere saath nahin he
 The Prime Minister knows that she did not talk to him (for example, Narasimha Rao)
 ve kehete the, kya karun main, pradhananmatri hum, main unase milanaa chahta hum
 This is the only non-indian quality among them? They have been here since the age of 19
 ve bhartiya nari kii tarah kapade jarur pahenti hai lekin hamaare dharmik granthon ke bare main zyada nahin jaanateen
 Well most of us don't know
 ve saare vrath or tyohaar manaati hai

 My son has nothing to do with this
 aap nahin maanate ki congress aisa kah sakati he?main to kahuunga ki “aap congress ko kitna jaanate hai?” ve joker mujhase aisa kaise kah sakate hai? sonia gandhi ko ve kitna jaanate hai?kyonki aap kitaab ko modi se milane ke prasang par khatm karte hai
 Yes, i went to meet him
 main hairaan tha ki paanch maheene biit jane ke baad bhi unhone videsh niti ke bare main ek shabd nahin kaha
 i went to him and said, "I did not come to ask you for anything
 main aap se kehane aayaa hum ki agar aap pradhanmantri hai to or antat aap videsh mantri bhi hai
 "they said, 'tell' i said," Start with the neighbors

 The Kashi Vidhyat Parishad had last week announced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be conferred with the title Rashtra Rishi (national Saint)
 parishad kii ore se iske liye apaat baithak bulaakar prastaav bhi paarit kara diya gaya
 But now the council has been divided into two groups
 ek gut ne ise raajnneeti se prerit bataate hue is sammaan kaa virodh kiya he
 The title given to PM Modi has now come under controversy
 piem ko oopaadhi par parishad ke hi mahasachiv shivaji upaadhyaay ne niyamon kaa anupaalan naa kiye jane kaa hawala dete hue is par sawaal uthaae he
 At the same time, dismissing the allegations, the council's secretary Dr Ram Narayan Dwivedi said that this decision has been taken within the scope of the rules
 vidwat parishad ke sachiv ne kaha ki apaat baithak kii jaankaree mahasachiv upaadhyaay samet kaaryakarini ke sabhi sadasyon ko phone ke madhyam se di gai thi
 He could not attend the meeting
 doctor dvivedi ne daawa kiya ki piem ko oopaadhi dene kaa tab upaadhyaay ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 Now know why he came down in protest
 unhone parishad ke do gut main bantane kii khabaron ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki kaaryakarini main koi gutbaji nahin he
 Most members agree to confer the title of Rishi on the Prime Minister
 kaashi vidwat parishad ke sachiv ne kaha ki 15 june ko kaaryakarini kii baithak bulaai gai he
 If there is any confusion in the mind of any member or official regarding a point, it will be resolved
 parishad ke mahasachiv ne lagaae the yah aropkashi vidwat parishad ke mahasachiv shivaji upaadhyaay ne faisle raajnneeti se prerit bataate hue kaha tha ki sattadhari dal ke prati jhukaav rakhane vaale kuch logon ne gaiyr raajnneetik sadasyon se vimarsh kiye bagaiyr hi oopaadhi dene kii ghoshnaa kar di
 For this neither the necessary procedure was adopted nor the resolution was passed in the council meeting
 rishi dvivedi samet parishad kii kaaryakarini ke kai sadasyon ne bhi upaadhyaay kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki is aashay kaa prastaav kab or kis meeting main paarit kiya gaya, isaki jaankaree hamen nahin he
 According to the claim, if the resolution for this was passed in the emergency meeting itself, the information of the meeting should have been given to all the members
 chunaav se purv lobing kaa bhi laga tha aaropaparishad kii ore se pehle piem modi or siem yogi adityanath ko oopaadhi pradaan karne ke liye lobing ke aarope bhi lage hai
 a member of the council's executive had alleged that two members were approached by a BJP central leader and a minister, when 90 per cent of the executive members opposed the awarding of degrees to the two leaders
 is sadsy ne kaha ki piem modi ko niyamon ko taak par rakh jaldbaaji main oopaadhi pradaan karne kii ghoshnaa kar di gai he
 This has damaged the image of the organization

 karnataka, kerala upi or bihar main alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri musalmaan hai lekin kai rajyon main aisa nahin he
 The Central Government's Minority Affairs website reveals a lot
 yahi ki is mantralay ke liye adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ke 118 pad sweekrut hai or itane kam kshamta ke baad bhi 42 pad khaali hai
 The budget of this ministry is only 3777 crores
 19 fisadi aabaadi ke kalyaan ke liye ye bajet kaaphi he yah sawaal unke liye he jo alpsankhyak mantralay ko dekhati badi baari tushtikaran dekhne lagate hai

 Just as the name of the Ministry of Minority Welfare starts to be seen through the spectacles of appeasement of the Muslim community, in the same way, we start seeing Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia as soon as their educational institutions are named
 jabaki ham bhul jate hai ki is desh main alag-alag samudaayon ke or bhashaaon ke aadhaar par bhi 13 hazaar se adhik alpsankhyak shikshan santhaan hai
 In Punjab itself, there are minority institutions of Jain society, Arya Samaj and Sikh society, there are colleges
 isi tarah se jain or isai samaaj ke bhi bade bade kalege hai
 These institutions also have the same rules as those for Jamia or Aligarh Muslim University

 pataa nahin kyon baar-baar ye sansthaaen vivaadon ke ghere main aa jaati hai
 If the government has problems, then open two or ten college universities
 baar baar e em you or jamiya millia ko lekar ye vivaad kyon paidaa kiya jaataa he jaise inke alpsankhyak hone se bada baari nuksaan ho rahaa he, tushtikaran ho rahaa he, haal hi main kuch jagahon par chapa ki sarkaar jamiya millia se alpsankhyak kaa darja waapas lene ja rahi he, jabaki sarkaar ne apni taraf se kuch bhi aisa nahin kaha he, isse pehle 2016 main bhi aisi khabaren chhapi thim or is baar bhi, On August 7, Ritika Chopra of the Indian Express reported that the central government was going to withdraw its affidavit from the court, the express came to know from sources, it is to be cautioned here that the minister has not formally announced
 ritika chopra ne likhaa he ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay dilli hoicourt main apana nayaa paksh rakhegi, mantralay adaalat se kehane ja rahaa he ki jamiya milia islamia kabhi alpsankhyak santhaan tha hi nahin kyonki ise sansad ke act se kaayam kiya gaya he, centre sarkaar ise fund karti he, 15 janvari 2016 ke indian express main hi khabar chhapi thi ki bharat sarkaar ke mahadhivaktaa ne tatkaaleen mantri ko salaah di he ki wo apana raay badal sakati hai yani jamiya alpsankhyak santhaan nahin he,tippaniyan Is it written somewhere that if the fund will be taken from the center then that institution will not be a minority, second we have to understand what is the motive behind establishing a minority educational institution and who are the people, if in a country with one nation one tax The argument to end the Minority Institution is being run in Whats Up University, so do they know that the same argument will also apply to Jain, Buddhist Sikh institutions, It is better that we define Minority in the Constitution
 unke kalyaan ke hue banane jane vaale sansthaanon kii sthiti ko thik se samaj len, baat sirf jamiya kii nahin he baat he kai hazaar minarity sansthaanon kii

 ritika chopra ne likhaa he ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay dilli hoicourt main apana nayaa paksh rakhegi, mantralay adaalat se kehane ja rahaa he ki jamiya milia islamia kabhi alpsankhyak santhaan tha hi nahin kyonki ise sansad ke act se kaayam kiya gaya he, centre sarkaar ise fund karti he, 15 janvari 2016 ke indian express main hi khabar chhapi thi ki bharat sarkaar ke mahadhivaktaa ne tatkaaleen mantri ko salaah di he ki wo apana raay badal sakati hai yani jamiya alpsankhyak santhaan nahin he,tippaniyan Is it written somewhere that if the fund will be taken from the center then that institution will not be a minority, second we have to understand what is the motive behind establishing a minority educational institution and who are the people, if in a country with one nation one tax The argument to end the Minority Institution is being run in Whats Up University, so do they know that the same argument will also apply to Jain, Buddhist Sikh institutions, It is better that we define Minority in the Constitution
 unke kalyaan ke hue banane jane vaale sansthaanon kii sthiti ko thik se samaj len, baat sirf jamiya kii nahin he baat he kai hazaar minarity sansthaanon kii
 The data shows that Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the Union Minister, holds the responsibility of many communities
 ye zarur he ki mantralay kii website sirf do bhashaaon main he
 In Hindi and English
 kaayade se gurmukhi main to ho hi sakati thi
 By the way, there can be a press release in Urdu
 jis tarah alpsankhyak kalyaan mantralay kaa naam aate hi use muslim samudaay ke tushtikaran ke chashme se dekha jane lagata he usee tarah inke shikshan sansthaanon kaa naam lete hi ham aligarh muslim uniwarsity or jamiya milia hi dekhne lagate hai
 While we forget that there are more than 13 thousand minority educational institutions in this country based on different communities and languages
 punjab main hi jain samaaj ke, aryasamaj ke or sikh samaaj ke alpsankhyak santhaan hai, kalege hai
 Similarly, Jain and Christian societies also have big colleges
 in sansthaanon main bhi vahi niyam hai jo jamiya yaa aligarh muslim uniwarsity ke liye hai
 Justice Suhail Siddiqui, the first chairman of the National Commission for Minorities Educational Institutions, said that in his view, these are the only two qualified universities for Muslims in the entire country
 kuch or hongi lekin naam bhar kii hai
 i do not know why these institutions are surrounded by disputes again and again
 agar sarkaar ko dikkat he to do nahin das kalege uniwarsity khol den
 Why is this controversy arising again and again about AMU and Jamia Milia as if it is causing huge losses due to their minority, appeasement is being made, recently the government printed some minority status from Jamia Milia Is going to take, while the government has not said anything like this on its behalf, earlier in 2016, such reports were printed and this time also, 7 agast ko indian express kii ritika chopra kii khabar chhapi ki centre sarkaar court se apana halafanama waapas lene ja rahi he, express ko yah jaankaree sutron se pataa chali he, yahaan yah saavdhaanee baratani hogi ki mantri ne aupchaarik rup se elaan nahin kiya he
 Ritika Chopra has written that the Ministry of Human Resources will present its new side in the Delhi High Court, the Ministry is going to tell the court that Jamia Millia Islamia was never a minority institution because it has been established by the Act of Parliament, the central government would fund it Is, the Indian Express of January 15, 2016 itself had reported that the Advocate General of the Government of India advised the then Minister to change his opinion
 May be, Jamia is not a minority institution, comments kya yah kahin likhaa he ki agar centre se fund liya jayega to vah santhaan minarity nahin rahegaa, doosraa hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki alpsankhyak shikshan santhaan kaayam karne ke peeche makasad kya hota he or koun log hote hai, agar van nesan van tex vaale desh main minarity santhaan khatm karne kii daleel whats ap uniwarsity main chalaai ja rahi he to kya unhen pataa he ki yahi daleel jain, buddha sikh sansthaanon par bhi lagu hogi, behatar he ki ham samvidhan main minarity kii paribhaasha
 Understand the situation of the institutions that are going to be made for their welfare, it is not just about Jamia, it is about thousands of minorities
 isi tarah se jain or isai samaaj ke bhi bade bade kalege hai
 These institutions also have the same rules as those for Jamia or Aligarh Muslim university

 5 Directors: Kabir Sadanand Kalakar: Vijender Singh, Mohit Marwah, Kiara Advani, Arif Lamba and and Jimmy Shergill have often seen in Bollywood films that directors want multiple messages in a single film

 Their right thinking spoils the entire flavor due to poor execution
 aisa hi kuch kabir sadanand ke saath bhi hua
 The film incorporates friendship, fun and finally social message

 Only Jimmy Shergill is handling the acting front
 vahi, aise kalakaar hai jo film main kuch chhap chhodte najar aate hai
 The film earns its own distinct mood
 aisa hi kuch is film ke saath he
 The film tries to introduce friendship, patriotism and the evils spread in the society

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni admitted that the team lost a lot of wickets early in the match against South Africa but also expressed happiness over the overall performance of the team in the ICC World T20
 bharat ne super aath ke aakhri lig match main dakshin africa ko ek ran se haraaya lekin net ran rate main pakistan se pichhadane ke kaaran vah semifinal main nahin pahunch paaya
 Dhoni said after the match, 'if you leave the match in Australia in which the rain was interrupted, then we did well in other matches
 hamane baaki sabhi match jite lekin duusari timen kaisaa pradarshan karti hai ham is par niyantran nahin rakh sakate
 The Indian captain made this remark regarding Australia's performance against Pakistan in the first match today
 australia vah match 32 ran se haar gaya, lekin iske baavjood vah semifinal main pahunch gaya
 Due to Pakistan's big win, India's difficulties were increased
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘main kul milakar team ke pradarshan se khush hum
 There were some occasions when we should have scored ten or 15 runs more
 hamaare khilaadiyon ne har match main acha khel dikhaaya
 If we talk today, it was expensive to lose a lot of wickets in the beginning
 ’divilliars ne kaha, ‘iske liye niraashajanak shabd paryaapt nahin hoga

 sanchaar sthapit hua to khadaa ho saktaa he vikram landagar khadaa ho gaya to rover bhi baahar nikal paaegachand kii sataha par vikram lander ke girane se isro abhi niraash nahin hua he
 It is different that Vikram Lander has fallen on the moon land about 500 meters away from his fixed place, but if it is approached then he can stand back on his feet
 isro ke vishwast sutron ke mutabik chandrayan-2 ke vikram lander main vah technology he ki vah girane ke baad bhi khud ko khadaa kar saktaa he, lekin uske liye jaruri he ki uske communication system se sampark ho jaae or use cmand risive ho sake
 Although the expectation of the success of this work is only 1 per cent, but ISRO scientists believe that at least one per cent is true, but there is hope
 vikram lander main onboard computer he
 It can do many things by itself
 vikram lander ke girane se vah antina dab gaya he jiske jariye communication system ko cmand bheja ja saktaa tha
 Right now ISRO scientists are trying to somehow give Vikram Lander the command to stand back on his feet through that antenna
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki gira hua vikram lander khud-ba-khud apane pairon par kaise khadaa hoga
 Will someone pick him up there
 aaie jaanate hai ki kaise apane pairon par khadaa hoga vikram landerisro ke sutron ne bataaya ki vikram lander ke neeche kii taraf paanch thrusters lage hai
 Through which it had to make a soft landing on the surface of the moon
 iske alaava, vikram lander ke chaaron taraf bhi thrusters lage hai, jo antariksh main yatra ke dauraan uski disha tay karne ke liye on kiye jate the
 These thrusters are still safe
 lander ke jis hisse main communication antina dabaa he, usee hisse main bhi thrusters hai
 If the command sent from the ground station located on the earth is received directly or through the orbiter by a suppressed antenna, its thrusters can be turned on
 thrusters on hone par vikram ek taraf se waapas uthakar apane pairon par khadaa ho saktaa he
 If this happens, all the experiments related to this mission will be possible, which ISRO scientists had already decided about Chandrayaan-2
 11 din bache hai vikram ko waapas apane pairon par khadaa karne ke lieisro pramukh ke
 Sivan had said on Sunday that isro's team was constantly trying to establish communication with Lander Vikram and that contact would be established soon
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik unke paas vikram se sampark saadhane ke liye 11 din hai
 Because Lunar Day is going on right now
 ek lunar de dharti ke 14 dinon ke baraabar hota he
 Out of this, 3 days have passed
 yani agle 11 dinon tak chand par din rahegaa
 After that there will be night on the moon, which is equal to 14 days of Earth
 raat main usase sampark karne main dikkat hogi
 Then ISRO scientists will have to wait

 afjal ke saamaan ke bare main yasin ne kaha ki ab ve bahumoolya hai

 yasin ne kaha ki yaa to ve hamen vahaan aane ke bare main bataa den yaa ham shav or saamaan lene ke liye khud se vahaan ja sakate hai
 He said that the family wants to deliver Afzal properly
 unhone kaha ki parivaar ne is sambandh main tihaad jail ke adhikariyon or baraamula ke upayukta ko ek patr likhaa he
 Significantly, 43-year-old Afzal was hanged on February 9 in Delhi's Tihar Jail
 parivaar ko afjal kii kabr par ‘fatiha’ padhne kii anumati dene par sarkaar ke vichaar karne ke grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ke bayaan par yasin ne kaha ki iskaa koi phayda nahin he
 He said, 'where will we study Fatiha? We want to bury them here in Sopore
 ’yasin ne afjal kii faansee ke bare main parivaar ko suchit karne vaale tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ke patr ko ‘nirdayee majaak’ qaraar diya
 The letter was received by the family on Monday
 yasin ne kaha ki patr kaa somvaar ko pahunchnaa parivaar ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane jaisaa he
 These wounds will never heal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki desh ke netaa afjal kii faansee par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 Yasin said that hanging Afzal was right or wrong, we do not want to go into it but leaders should not do politics

 Even after 65 years of independence in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh, railway tracks may not be laid, but this district is trying to give direction to the country in the field of solar energy on its own strength
 jile kii jhiranya tehsil ke kai gaanvon ko bijli ke maamle main aatmanirbhar banane kii ummid jagaai he nemit gaanv ke ek yuvak 37 varshiya dow

 saura urja main doctoret hasil karne vaale solanki iity-bombai main associat professor hai or gambhir bijli sankat se jujh rahe gaanvon ko saura urja se raushan karne kii muhim main jute hue hai
 Solanki knew that it would not be easy to prepare the villagers to adopt the new technology and no one would install solar energy pumps at their behest, so he started an education park in Kodla village in 2010 called Education Park to raise awareness of its importance School opened
 unhone is skool kii chat par bade-bade solar panel lagaae or graminon ko bataaya ki isse kis tarah bijli banaai jaati he
 This school is illuminated only by the electricity produced by solar energy and the water pump here also runs with the help of the same
 aglaa charan tha schuli bacchon ko is prakritik urja se jalane vaale lamp muhaiyaa karwaanaa taaki ve bijli ke abhaav main raat ke vakt bhi padhai kar saken
 So far, they have distributed 2,250 such lamps to school children free of cost
 apni ‘van child, van lamp’ yojana kaa vistaar karte hue solanki ne puure khargun jile main ek lakh schuli bacchon ko 15 agast, 2013 tak lamp dene kaa lakshya tay kiya he
 "solar energy is a better alternative to kerosene and diesel," he says
 yah na keval sasta he balki paryaavaran ke lihaaj se bhi acha he
 The local administration also praised Solanki's effort
 khargun ke colector navaneet kothaari kehete hai, ‘‘saura urja kaa vikalp un kisaanon ke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit ho saktaa he jinke kheton tak bijli kii pahunch philhal mushkil he
 The state government has given Rs 20 lakh to help Solanki plan
 sweekrut kiye hai
 "kisan Urja Kendra" has also been built in the education park, the roof of which has been prepared with solar panels
 is centre kaa uddeshy kisaanon ko saura urja ke prati jaagruk bananaa he
 In fact, due to the power crisis, the farmers of the district have a lot of problem in irrigating the fields and diesel pumps are expensive
 solanki bataate hai ki dijal pump se ek cubic meter pani khinchne kaa kharch jahaan 1
 57 Rs
 aata he vahiin saura urja se chalane vaale pump main yah kharrcha ghatakar mahaj 52 paisa rah jaataa he
 Self-reliance will come, so separate

 Ghanshyam Gaur of Shivna village says, "we are seriously thinking about installing solar pumps for irrigation of fields
 ’’ nemit gaanv ke manoj solanki kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar jitani sabsidi dijal par de rahi he agar utani hi solar pump par de to gaanv ke adhikansh kisaan dijal janarator kii bajaae solar takanic ko apana lenge
 "the government should make an alternative energy policy effective," says Bharat Jhanwar, a chartered accountant who is supporting Solanki's noble cause

 rafel vimaan saude main raksha mantralay ke decent note ke khulaase par mache siyaasi bhuuchaal ke bich is maamle main niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (kaig) kii report taiyaar ho gai he
 The report related to Rafale was ready for print on Friday and it is believed that it can be sent to Parliament on Monday
 sansad ke bajet satr ke ab aakhri 3 din bache hai, aise main sarkaar rafel saude se judi kaig report sadan ke patal par rakh sakati he
 On Friday, an English newspaper claimed through documents on the Rafale deal that officials of the Ministry of Defense had lodged an objection to parallel negotiations by the Prime Minister's Office in the matter
 haalanki raksha mantralay kii aapatti par raksha mantri kaa jawaab is report main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi made serious allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the revelation of the report published in the newspaper
 to vahiin sansad main bhi vipaksh ne ise mudda banaakar satta paksh ko gherne kii koshish kii lekin raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne apane jawaab main spasht kar diya ki yah report adhure dastavej par aadhaarit thi
 Because it did not include the reply of the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki piemo is saude main saamanantar baatcheet nahin kar rahaa tha balki prakriya kii nigaraanee kar rahaa tha
 On the other hand, details of the CAG audit report related to the Rafale deal were sought under the Right to Information Act
 jiske jawaab main kaig kii taraf se kaha gaya ki abhi rafel maamle main ankekshan kii prakriya jari he or sansad ke samaksh report ke prastut hone se pehle iskaa khulaasa karnaa sansad ke visheshadhikaar kaa hanan hoga
 Earlier, while dismissing the petitions related to the alleged scam in the Rafale deal, the Supreme Court had said that there was no flaw in the process of the plane deal
 isliye maamle main jaanch kii jarurat nahin he
 However, there was a lot of controversy over a comment made in the order of the Supreme Court
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rafel kii prais detail kaig ke saath saajha kii gai he or kaig kii report kaa ek hissaa sansad kii lok lekha samiti (piesi) ke samaksh rakhaa gaya or vah public domen main he
 On this comment made by the Supreme Court regarding the CAG report, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and PAC President Mallikarjun Kharge made a joint press conference that the report mentioned in the court's decision did not come in the PAC
 congress ne is maamle main modi sarkaar par supreme court ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Seeing the matter growing, a request was made by the government to improve the remarks made in relation to the CAG in the order of the Supreme Court
 jisamen sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki uski taraf se die gaye silband note main kaha gaya tha ki sarkaar kaig ke saath pehle hi price detail saajha kar chuki he
 The woman told, 'he started telling me how disappointed and sad he is in his married life
 unhone mujhase yah bhi poocha ki main apane pati ke saath kaise rahati hum or kya mujhe har din sex karne kii jarurat nahin padati
 i said that i do not want to talk about all these issues and i called the cab

 uttarakhand ke rajyapal ajij kuraishi surkhiyon main hai
 The reason, his petition filed in the Supreme Court, in which he expressed his intention to do two or two hands with the Modi government
 unhone supreme court se fariyaad kii ki aakhir rajyapal kii kursi kii yah kisi tauheen ki kendriya grih sachiv phone karke usase istipha dene ko kah de
 However, the Union Home Ministry, in its reply filed in the court, said that Qureshi's conduct is reducing the dignity of the post of Governor
 kendriya grih sachiv anil goswami ne supreme court main daakhil jawaab main kaha ki kuraishi ne haal hi main ek bayaan diya jisamen unhone kaha ki balaatkaar jaise maamle to khuda ke dakhal se hi ruk sakate hai
 Goswami says that a person sitting in such a sensitive constitutional post should not make such an irresponsible statement
 haalanki rajyapal kuraishi is baat se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 They say that it will be decided by the people of Uttarakhand whether their conduct is dignified or not
 pichley dinon 22 june se 22 july ke bich jab ve uttar pradesh ke kaaryvahak rajyapal bane to maheene bhar kaa unka kaarykaal kuch chhap chhod gaya
 During this time he had a confrontation with the central government
 unhone samaajawaadee parrty ke kaddavar netaa mohammad ajam khan ke sanchaalan vaale moulana mohammad ali johar vishvavidhyalay kii varshon se lataki file ko ek jatke main paas kiya or uniwarsity ko alpsankhyak uniwarsity kaa darja de diya
 Qureshi says that as soon as the Central Government got the idea, Home Secretary Goswami got a call that the Governor should not sign the file
 lekin rajyapal karyaalay ne grih sachiv ko bataaya ki rajyapal file par dastakhat kar chuke hai
 Qureshi says, "it is my privilege to approve a university named after Maulana Mohammad Ali Johar, the leader of the Khilafat movement, which became the first example of Gandhiji's hindu-muslim unity
" ’’ghatnakram par tippanee karte hue ajam khan kehete hai, ‘‘ham rajyapal mahoday ke shukraguzaar hai
 Prior to this, Raj Bhavan was not passing this file for years only, why should Mohammad Azam Khan be Chancellor of Taumra University? Raj Bhavan stood against the training of Muslims in opposition to just one person
 ’’in taaja vaakyaat se lagata he ki kabhi indira gandhi kii taraf se chune gaye pehle 100 congressi kaaryakartaaon main shaamil bhoupal ke kuraishi apni rajnatik prishthbhumi ke kaaran bijepi sarkaar se takaraav lene kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahe
 But 74-year-old Qureshi, who was a minister in the Congress governments of Madhya Pradesh and a Congress MP from Satna, is a bellow
 pichley do saal ke kaarykaal main unhone pradesh kii congress sarkaar ko bhi apni atisakriyata se hairaan kar rakhaa he
 Qureshi assumed the post of Governor of Uttarakhand on 15 May 2012
 unhone badrinaath dham kii yatra kii
 Apart from this, the demand for passing the Act from the Legislative Assembly or Center for the operation of the four dhams of Uttarakhand was also raised
 unka kahana tha ki tirupati balaji yaa ajmer kii dargah sharif kii tarj par in dhaamon kii vyavastha honi chahie, taaki tirth purohit or baaki sabhi pakshon ke hit surakshit rakhe jaaen
 Qureshi came into the limelight even during the Kedarnath accident in June last year
 us samay mukhyamantri ke centre sarkaar se sampark karne se pehle hi rajyapal ne centre se suraksha bal bhejne or raahat abhiyaan shuru karne kii maang kar di thi
 As soon as he heard the news of the June 16 disaster, he instructed the entire government machinery, including the district administration and police, to be active by phone all night
 dilli kii ek mahila ne rajyapal ko phone par dilli ke teen sau schuli bacchon ke is kshetra main fanse hone kii jaankaree di to kuraishi ne un bacchon kii surakshit nikasi sunishchit karai
 For five days after the disaster, he kept in touch with officers through phone, SMS and email from the Raj Bhavan of Nainital, away from the capital Dehradun and kept giving instructions like the Chief Minister
 yahaan tak ki unhone tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna kii sarkaar kii shikaayat centre kii upie sarkaar se kar di
 The condition of their availability in the people was that even the mule-makers were calling them to get their mules safely
 lekin nirvaachit sarkaar kii maujuudagi main rajbhavan kii itani sakriyata kitni jaij he? is sawaal par itr sanjone ke shaukeen kuraishi kehete hai, ‘‘jab main uttarakhand kaa rajyapal bana to haridwar ke ek namchin baba, jinase bada koi nahin he, ne kaha ki ek mustande ko devbhumi kaa rajyapal bana diya he, vah yahaan kya karegaa
 i am answering this with my work
 ’’badrinaath dham main bas haadase ke baad vahaan pahunchnaa or bhagwaan ke darshan karnaa
 After this, it has been their way of working for millions of people to contact Sulabh International immediately for adequate toilet arrangements
 rajyapal hone ke baavjood unhone sarkaar ko aagaah karne se gurej nahin kiya ki kai dharmik sthalon par kuch log kundali maare baithe hai or vyavasthaaon ko tabah kar rahe hai
 Qureshi says how the elderly and sick will travel to Chardham by road, why the state government does not give them subsidized air tickets? Not only this, Qureshi, who received his phd from Hamidia College in Bhopal, considered any insult to the Vice Chancellors of the Universities of the state as an insult to the Chancellor
 kulapatiyon ke sammelan main unhone afasaron ko taakid kii ki ve shikshavidon se adab se pesh aaen or zyada saahabgiri na dikhaaen
 But on the other hand, they have not allowed the Congress government of the state to appoint a vice-chancellor in Govind Ballabh Pant University
 ve sarkari prastaav ko yah kahkar khaarij kar de rahe hai ki santhaan kii garima ke hisaab se naam sujhaayaa jaae
 He also advocates making Pantnagar University a central university instead of becoming an arena of politics under the state
 yani ve apni marji ke hisaab se kaam kar rahe hai or rajbhavan ke bhavy lekin neeras protocol main khud ko baandhne ko raji nahin hai
 The Home Secretary is arguing that his statement to remove him from the post has also been given as the Governor of UP
 centre kii sarkaar badalane ke baad rajbhavan main badlaav tay he, phir bhi adalati aadesh par sabaki najar rahegi
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has changed her schedule for the Kolkata Knight Riders reception
