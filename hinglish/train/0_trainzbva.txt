 India believes that the Pakistani army runs a "network of terror", under which terrorists are recruited and trained for attacks like Pathankot and Uri in 2016 and incite firing on the Line of Control for their infiltration

 Meanwhile, BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey had said that Gupta felt that by his actions this time he would not get a ticket from the BJP, so he sought his new home, Gupta, who is a big businessman, on the 2009 SP ticket Fought from Phulpur but had to face defeat

 He insisted on keeping a full watch on the money being spent on organizing the Games and determining accountability and also demanded an independent agency to audit the expenditure incurred so far on organizing the Commonwealth Games
 jadyu netaa ne kaha ki chunki rashtramandal khelon par hone vaale kharch ko lekar aalochanaayen ho rahi hai, aise main aam aadmi kharche kaa hisaab jaananaa chahega, isliye ab tak hue kharch kaa audit kisi swatantra agency se karaayaa jaye kyonki yah desh bina kisi javabdehi ke karadaataaon ke paise ko pani kii tarah bahaane ko bardaasht nahin kar saktaa
 JDU leader Sharad Yadav said that the amount of money being spent in the name of Commonwealth Games was never made available to the Sports Ministry for the development of sports in the country

 He said that if the preparations for the Commonwealth Games were completed on time, it would have saved a lot of money

 The Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee and the Central Government were stunned when the Committee challenged the government's decision to hold it responsible for making information public under the Right to Information Act

 jab aspataalon main bed hi nahin hoga, to kisi ko ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa laabh bhala kaise mil paaegaa? lekin durbhaagya yah he ki swasthya kshetra ke buniyadi dhaancha vikaas kii gati bahut dhimi he, isi vajah se sehat ke morche par nijee kshetra kii lut jari he
 The second finance minister of the Modi government formed for the second time is expected from Nirmala Sitharaman that she will take some effective steps on this front in the budget
 swasthya kshetra kii sehat badtaranational health profile 2018 ke mutabik desh ke kareeb 23,582 sarkari aspataalon main 7,10,761 bed hai
 Only one allopathic doctor is available in every 10 thousand people in the country
 isamen se bhi mahaj 10 fisadi sarkari aspataalon main karyrat hai
 In this way, there is only one bed in a government hospital for every 2000 people
 sava sau karod se zyada kii jansankhya main yah kshamta oont ke munh main jira jaisaa hi he
 There are currently 476 medical colleges and 562 dental colleges in the country
 inamen kareeb 87,000 student padhai karte hai
 Likewise every year 1
 30 lakh general nurse midwife nursing sansthaanon main or 46,795 student farmesi collejon main padhai karte hai
 About 70 crore population of the country live in rural areas, but only 1 to meet their health needs
 56 lakh swasthya up centre, kareeb 26 hajaar praathmik swasthya centre or 5,624 saamudayik swasthya centre hai (31st March 2017 tak)
 Thus there is a huge shortage of doctors and hospitals in rural areas
 jhola chhap doctoron kii bharamarvishwa swasthya sanghathan kii ek report ke anusaar, gramin ilaakon kii 75 fisadi praathmik swasthya seva jhola chhap doctoron ke bharose hai
 Only one doctor out of every five in rural areas is eligible to practice medicine
 jhola chhap doctoron kii samasya ko ujagar karte hue dablyuechao kii is report main chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 This report, which came out in the year 2016, says that 31 of the people who describe themselves as allopathic doctors in villages
 4 fisadi sirf 12veen tak padhe hai, jabaki 57
 3 so-called doctors have not taken medical education from anywhere
 samasya bas itani nahin he
 The equipment which is available in government hospitals is also not being used
 niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (CAG) kii ek report se yah khulaasa hua he ki aspataalon main clinical equipment kii 27
 31 per cent and 56 of non-clinical equipment
 33 fisadi kami he, lekin yah tathy bhi chaunkaane vaala he ki kai mahatvapurn medical equipment kaa paanch-paanch saal tak istemaal nahin ho paata kyonki unke salanaa rakrakhaav kaa contract nahin hua he
 In this way, it is clear that if the government wants to improve the health sector of the country, then its infrastructure development will have to be revolutionized in the same way as the Modi government has done in the matter of roads
 antarim bajet main kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne health sector kaa bajet kareeb 16 fisadi badhaakar 61,398 karod rupee karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin isamen kareeb 6,400 karod rupaya ayushmaan bharat yojana ke bare main he
 It is expected that in this full budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will take some major steps to improve the health of the healthcare sector of the country

 Employees working in the private sector can get a big gift today
 kendriya mantrimandal gracuty bhugtan kanoon (payment of Gratuity Act) ke tahat kar-mukt gracuty seemaa doguni kar 20 lakh rupee karne se jude sanshodhan vidheyak ke masaude par aaj vichaar kar saktaa he
 It has been recommended that people working in the private sector should also get gratuity up to a maximum of Rs 20 lakh, just like central employees
 kanoon main sanshodhan ke baad privet sector amployies 20 lakh rupee tak kii texfri gracuty ke hakdaar ho jaaenge
 The comments pichley dinon shram mantralay kii baithak main privet companiyon ke karmiyon ke naukari chhodane par 10 lakh rupee kii jagah 20 lakh rupee tak gracuty dene par sahmati ban gai thi
 After the proposal is passed by the cabinet, it will be introduced as a bill in Parliament in the next part of the budget session
 dhyaan dilaa den ki saatven vetan ayog ne gracuty kii seemaa das se badhaakar bees lakh karne kii sifarish kii thi jise centre sarkaar or kai rajya sarkarein lagu kar chuki hai
 In a meeting chaired by Labor Minister Bandaru Dattatreya, it was decided to bring such a bill in Parliament that whenever the amount of gratuity of central workers is increased, the gratuity in the private sector also automatically increases
 yah sanshodhan vidheyak aay str main vruddhi ko dekhte hue kanoon main sanshodhan sansad ke bajaae sarkari aadesh ke jariye karne kaa adhikaar centre sarkaar ko dene kii baat kahata he
 Quoting the source, the news agency Bhasha said, "the Union Cabinet may consider the bill related to amendment of gratuity payment law on Wednesday
 ' Recently, in the meeting of the Ministry of Labor, it was agreed to give gratuity up to Rs 20 lakh instead of Rs 10 lakh for the employees of private companies
 cabinet se prastaav paas hone ke baad ise bajet satr ke agle hisse main sansad main vidheyak ke rup main pesh kiya jayega
 It may be noted that the Seventh Pay Commission had recommended raising the limit of gratuity from ten to twenty lakhs, which has been implemented by the Central Government and many State Governments
 shrammantri bandaaru dattatreya kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main faisla liya gaya ki sansad main aisa vidheyak laayaa jaae ki jab bhi kendriyakarmiyon kii gracuty kii raashi main badhotaree hogi to nijee kshetra main bhi gracuty main apane aap ijapha ho
 In view of the increase in the income level, this amendment bill calls for giving the right to the Central Government to amend the law through government order instead of Parliament

 prashasan ab yah kah rahaa he ki shashan str yani lakhanu se koi nirdesh milane ke baad hi modi ko raily ke liye maidan uplabdh karaayaa jayega
 In fact, the way the communal tensions are arising at different places in Uttar Pradesh, the administration is very cautious

 It also includes a serious incident like setting fire to a police station in Katera town

 It is worth noting that 278 crores of the film industry are on Sanjay Dutt

 Those whose films are stuck are also pleading for some mercy for Sanjay Dutt from the Supreme Court
 film nirmaataa apurv lakhiya ne bataaya, ‘hamane ek letters likhaa he, jisamen likhaa he ki jabatak kaam khatm nahin hota unhen chhot milani chahie
 On the other hand, Jabunnisa had pleaded for relief from the court citing her age
 70 saal kii jabunnisa kidney ke cancer se peedit hai, uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Jabunnisa said in her petition that she not only needs to be constantly under the care of doctors, but also always a caregiver
 usne kaha tha ki is haalat main jail main rahete hue vah batch nahin paaegi
 The answers to Sanjay Dutt's arguments also pose some legitimate questions
 wo sawaal kuch yun ho sakate hai:-film banaakar kya desh par ehsaan kar rahe hai sanjay dutt?-kya project se jude logon kaa rojgaar sthaayee he?-jab maaloom tha ki hai court se sajaa mil chuki he, supreme court kaa faisla bhi jald aayega, to phir nai filmein sin kyon kii?-munna ke aadhaar par narmi ho to kaancha-china, khalanaayak or duusare gunahagaaron kii bhoomika par kya sakhti honi chahie?-sanjay dutt kii 7 filmein relies nahin hongi to kya desh ko bada nuksaan ho jayega?kuch sawaal kanoon ke jaankaar bhi puch rahe hai:sanjay dutt jaise hi aarope or waisi hi sajaa paae 1993 mumbai dhamaakon ke teen gunahagaaron jabunnisha, kaaji or abdul gafoor kii mohalat kii yachika supreme court ne mangalvaar ko hi khaarij kar di thi
 In such a situation, the path of getting time for Sanjay Dutt is not easy

 a promotional video for this event was also to be shot
 lekin kaajol ke pair main chot ke kaaran isamen der ho rahi he
 The film established Aditya Chopra as film director in Bollywood
 pesh he is film se judi kuch rochak baaten-ddlj ke liye shahrukh nahin the pehali pasandshahrukh khan ke 30wein janmdin ke kuch din pehle film 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' relies hui thi
 Shah Rukh Khan's character in the film Raj Malhotra rode on people's minds overnight
 lekin is role ke liye shahrukh khan pehali pasand nahin the
 Aditya Chopra had previously offered the film to Saif Ali Khan
 kaajol ko nahin pataa tha shahrukh unhen patakane vaale hai
 
 
 The song 'ruk Ja o Dil Deewane' in the film
 
 
 ' ke ant main shahrukh kaajol ko jameen par patake dete hai
 Interestingly, Kajol did not know about it
 darasal, aditya chopra kaajol kaa natural riection shoot karnaa chaahate the
 So he did not tell this thing to Kajol
 kaajol ne shahrukh ke seene par lagaae the lipstick ke nishanapako wo seen to yaad hi hoga jab shahrukh khan apni shart hataate hai or seene par lage lipstick ke nishaan dikhaate hai
 In fact, before the shoot of the scene, Kajol had made those marks on Shahrukh's chest
 is seen ko shoot karne main kai tech lene pade the kyonki jab-jab shahrukh khan apni shart hataate the, kaajol kii hansi chhot jaati thi
 The song was rejected 24 times, 'mere khwabon mein jo aaye
 
 
 ''mere khwaabon main jo aae
 
 
 kalyan-anand had lost sweat in preparing the music of the song
 aditya chopra ne puure 24 baar iske alag-alag dhun ko riject kiya tha
 The tune that was finally finalized is still on people's tongue
 duusare film ke liye shoot hua tha gaanaa 'mehandi lagaake rakhana
 
 
 'it was the same song through which Farah Khan's entry into the Yash Raj Camp
 lekin is gane ko kisi or film ke liye record kiya gaya tha
 Kiran Kher had suggested the title of the film, Kiran Kher, wife of Anupam Kher, who played Shah Rukh Khan's father, suggested the title of the film
 vahiin, film main hero kaa naam rajkpur ke naam se prerit tha
 The film established itself through Aditya Chopra through three-three directorial films given to Bollywood, Karan Johar and Arjun Sablok playing Shahrukh's friends are known in Bollywood today as film directors

 Amid speculation about joining the Congress, Munde told reporters after meeting opposition leader Sushma Swaraj at his residence, 'I was in BJP and i am in BJP
 is sambandh main jo khabaren aa rahi hai, vah galat he
 When asked about the meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel, he said, "he never met the Chief Minister of Maharashtra or Ahmed Patel during his ongoing talks with top BJP leaders 
 is tarah kii khabaren niraadhaar hai
 Asked about the party's solution to the suffering of its supporters and supporters, Munde said, "I have never made my suffering public
" maine ise party ke sheersh netaaon ke samaksh rakh diya he or ab unhen hi iskaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa he
 When asked about the suffering of Munde, Sushma Swaraj said, 'the sufferings are kept in proper place, it is not made public
 munde ne apni pidaa uchit sthaan par rakh di he
 Its solution will come out
 ’ party chhodane or congress main shaamil hone kii khabaron ke bare main puche jane par sushamaa ne kaha, ‘is tarah kii afvaahen munde kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye failaayi ja rahi he
 Munde himself has clarified that the reports coming in this regard are false
 ’ sushamaa se 40 minute kii mulaakaat se pehle loksabhaa main party ke upanetaa munde ne sweekaar kiya ki unhen bahut si baton ko lekar ‘pareshaaniyaan’ hai or in sab par vah sushamaa sahit party ke varisht netaaon se koi samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye baatcheet kar rahe hai
 He will also meet some other senior leaders of the party
 sawaalon ke jawaab main unhone congress yaa samprag sarkaar main shaamil hone kii charchaaon ko bhi khaarij karte hue unhen mahaj afvaahen bataaya
 Sushma said that she was not in Delhi during Munde's meeting with top party leaders two days ago
 munde ne unase milane or unke samukh apni baat rakhane kaa aagrah kiya tha

 The public's confidence in the Mamta Banerjee government is losing

 The ruling TMC has consistently targeted the BJP
 isi kram main aaj tiemasi ne jansangh sansthaapak shyama prasad mukherjee kii punyatithi manaai
 TMC has paid tribute to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on his death anniversary
 bengal ke mantri sowndeb chatarji ne rajya sarkaar kii taraf se kolkata ke kokaratala main mukherjee kii pratimaa par maalyaparn kar shradhanjali arpit kii
 Sovandeb Chatterjee said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak' that BJP Dr
 shyama prasad mukherjee ko ek sampradayik netaa ke rup main project kar rahi he jaisaa ki uski vibhaajan vaali raajnneeti ko suut karata he
 He said, 'while the reality is that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee as the VC of Calcutta University established Islamic Studies in the university
 vah bengal ke sachche sapoot the
 His true legacy needs to be disseminated to the public
 agar shyama prasad mukherjee jinda hote to unhe bijepi kii raajnneeti par shame aati
 On behalf of the BJP, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi also mentioned the incidents of violence in West Bengal in a conversation with Aaj Tak
 unhone kaha ki 'pashchim bengal main sanvaidhanik mashinari puri tarah dhwast ho gai he

 Recently, Shah Rukh Khan, who has completed 25 years in Bollywood, said during a conversation with a daily newspaper that i like to talk and whenever someone calls me to give a speech, i take it as an opportunity
 khaas baat ye he ki king khan oxford ke liye apni spich khud hi likhnaa chaahate hai
 He said that i do not like anyone writing for me

 However, at the moment he has no idea on which topic he will talk to the students in Oxford

 The impact of Jaswant Singh's rebellion is visible in many places in Rajasthan
 pradesh main kai jagahon par nae tarah ke poster lagaae gaye hai, jisamen atal, adwani ke saath jaswant singh najar aa rahe hai
 As far as the ticket from Barmer seat is concerned, on Saturday, the party president Rajnath Singh made it clear that now the candidate from Barmer will not be changed
 iske baad jaswant ne elaan kiya ki ve 24 march ko bataaenge ki unhen kya karnaa he
 Taunting his own party, he said, 'I will tell, is it real BJP, what is fake
 ' gauratlab he ki jaswant singh pehle hi kah chuke hai ki ve barmer se nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par chunaav ladenge
 MJ Akbaris, who came to BJP, is a matter of relief for the BJP that another big name has been added to the list of those joining the party

 ) chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mere mobile main bijepi netaa ashvini upaadhyaay kaa ek esemes barbar peen-peen karata rahaa- dilli ko 15 din main bhrashtachar mukt or 3 maheene ke bheetar aparaadh mukt kar denge
 The promises of the Aam Aadmi Party regarding corruption are also no less
 iske alaava bhi is chunaav main aapane itane vaade or daawey sune honge, jinako dekhte hi lagata he ki partiyon ke paas koi alladin kaa charaag he, jise kursi par baithte hi siem jala degaa
 However, in this case, BJP President Amit Shah has shown some clearness that Modi's promise to bring black money of 15 lakh rupees to the bank account was an election jumla
 to behatar hoga ki chunaav ke baad jab netaa aapako bataaen ki unke vaade chunavi jumale the, usase pehle hi aap hakeekat par najar daal len-nirbhaya ko nahin bachaa saktaa siem-dilli kii kanoon vyavastha or police sidhe centre sarkaar ke haath main hoti he
 In this case, the Chief Minister of Delhi can do as much as any common man
 jo bhi party aparaadh mitaane kaa daawa kar rahi he vah solah aane jhooth bol rahi he
 But what should the parties also do? Crime and other crimes against women in Delhi automatically become an electoral issue, in such a case the parties cannot live without claiming them
 isliye ganth baandh lijie ki siem kisi party kaa bane, dilli ke aparaadhon kii jimmedaari grahamantri rajnath singh kii hogi, kisi kejariwal, kiran bedi yaa ajay maakan kii nahin hogi
 The promises of electricity are also aerial - in the campaign, the Prime Minister repeatedly said that such arrangements will be made that you will take electricity connection from whichever company
 unhone aasaan shabdon main bataaya ki jaise mobile oparator badal sakate hai vaise hi bijli company badali ja sakegi
 Let me tell you here that the then government of Sheila Dikshit in Siddhantarup had passed this system
 lekin bijli mobile signal kii tarah mobile tower se na aakar bijli ke taron se aati he
 Apart from this, there are many operational compulsions, due to which the arrangement could not be implemented despite everyone agreeing in principle five years ago
 or isi chunaav abhiyaan main aisi koi buniyadi baat nahin kahi gai, jisamen in oparational majaburiyon ko badalane kii baat kahi gai ho
 On the other hand, cheap electricity of AAP will only come from subsidies
 uske kehane par bijli companiyaan kisi surat main daam kam nahin karengi
 On the contrary, if the government tries more, they will disturb Delhi's electricity supply, summer is coming after a month anyway
 or agar sarkaar ne sabsidi di to iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 The Nizam of the Delhi Government runs with the help of the Center
 jaahir he kejariwal sarkaar bani to haar se baukhalaaye modi kam se kam sabsidi ke liye to use paisa dene vaale nahin hai
 So there is no possibility of getting excited over electricity
 haryana pani nahin degaa-pichley 10 saal dilli or centre main congress sarkaar thi, lekin haryana ne dilli ko atirikt pani nahin diya
 If Haryana does this, what will be the Chief Minister's answer to his farmers? isiilie 10 janvari kii pradhanmantri kii raily main maujuud hone ke baavjood haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter pani ke mudde par puri tarah khamosh rahe
 Center, MCD and DDA - It has been said above that the police are near the center
 iske alaava dilli vidhansabha main koi vidheyak rakhane se pehle use centre kii manjuuri leni hoti he
 This system does not apply in any other state, but being half the state, the Chief Minister of Delhi has to do every work by asking the big court
 pichhali baar lokapal ko lekar bhi yahi pech fansaa tha
 Kejriwal brought the bill without the Centre's permission and the Congress did not support it by citing the rules
 yani centre se achche rishte ke bina vidhansabha main patta nahin hilegaa
 The second issue is the MCD and the rest of the municipal bodies
 dilli kii mukhya sadaken or fli over to 15 saal main shila dikshit itane banavaa chuki hai ki ab banavaane kii jagah hi nahin he
 Roads inside the colonies come to the MCD
 shahar kii saaf-safai bhi inhen nikaayon ke paas he
 That is, the world of streets and settlements is completely out of the cm's hands as soon as Delhi is removed from the streets
 yani yahaan ke bare main bhi aap mukhyamantri se sawaal na karen
 If there is an issue of building houses for the poor, then the DDA is in possession of Delhi's land
 jab tak didie haa na kare, dilli sarkaar ke paas nae nirmaan karne ke liye jagah nahin hogi
 No clash, find a way Cmatto Can the Chief Minister of Delhi do nothing
 aisa bhi nahin he, vah chaahe to shiksha or swasthya par dhyaan de saktaa he
 In addition, Delhi Jal Board can focus on better management of the water already existing
 shahar ko khubasurat banane ke bhi uske paas vikalp hai
 But all these works are not going to make sensation or news despite development
 aise main behatar hoga ki mukhyamantri centre, didie yaa nikaay ke kaamon main dakhal dene ke bajaay apane simit kaaryakshetra main kaam kare
 The sooner the Chief Minister of Delhi accepts that he is the incomplete Chief Minister of the incomplete state, the sooner he will be able to serve the people of Delhi better
 agar usne duusare mukhyamantriyon se apni tulana kii to dilli vaale haath malate rah jaaenge
 Anyway, the Chief Minister's chair is too small in terms of the election campaign in Delhi
 mumbai hamalon ke pratyakshdarshi gavaahon ke mumbai kii aatankwaad nirodhak adaalat main die gaye bayanon ko bharat saboot ke taur par pakistan bhejega
 Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam gave this information
 sabooton main magistratka bayaan bhi shamilunhone bataaya ki adaalat ne abhiyojan paksh kii us apil ko manjuuri de di he jisamen abhiyojan paksh ne bayanon kii pramanit pratiyaan maangi thi
 In a day or two, these statements will be sent as evidence to Pakistan through diplomatic means
 pratyakshdarshi ke bayaan ke saath us magistrate kii gavaahi bhi he jiske samaksh pakistani aatankwaadi mohammad ajmal kasaab ne ikbaalia bayaan diya tha or pichley saal 26 november ko hue hamale main apni kathith bhoomika sweekaar kii thi
 Kasab is the only surviving terrorist captured during the Mumbai attacks
 lakhvi ke khilaaf paak main chal rahi he sunwaayeenicum ne bataaya ki bayanon ke alaava kuch videshi nagarikon kii gavaahi kaa byora or taj, obaroy hotalon tathaa nariman house se baraamad kuch saamaan bhi pakistan bheja jayega
 The terrorists were attacked in Taj, Oberoi hotels and Nariman House itself
 magistrate ke bayaan ko mahatvapurn samajha ja rahaa he kyonki usne nichali adaalat main kaha tha ki kasaab ne uske samaksh sweekaar kiya tha ki hamale kaa shadyantr pakistan main jackieur rahamaan lakhvi sahit lashkar e taiyaba ke kartadhartaaon ne rachaa tha
 a hearing is going on in Pakistan court against Lakhvi
 epabiai ke adhikariyon kii gavaahi bhi shamilbayaan main epabiai ke adhikariyon kii gavaahi bhi hogi
 He had said in the lower court that the mobile phones recovered from the scene of the incident were used by the terrorists in conversation with their masters in Pakistan during the attack
 videsh kii ek mobile company ke adhikariyon ne bhi adaalat main video conference ke madhyam se gavaahi di ki aatankwaadiyon dwaara prayukt mobile phone china se pakistan mangavaaye gaye the
 According to Nikam, among the items recovered from the terrorists are rubber boats and food items etc
 labeled with "made in Pakistan"
 in saamaanon ko bhi pakistan bheja jayega taaki yah sabit kiya ja sake ki hamale kaa shadyantr pakistan main rachaa gaya tha or aatankwaadi pakistan se bharat aae the
 India has already given evidence in this case the Government of India has already sent evidence to Pakistan
 isamen kasaab kaa ikbaalia bayaan or adaalat main police dwaara daakhil aaropapatr shaamil hai
 However, the Pakistani court called these evidences "insufficient" to frame charges against Lakhvi and six others
 in sabake khilaaf pakistan kii adaalat main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 Nikam said that the confession given by Kasab in the anti-terrorism Court has been described by the magistrate as "voluntary"
 aise main kasaab ke khilaaf pramaan na keval pukhta balki ‘‘nishpaksh or vishwasaneey’’ bhi ho jate hai
 He said the statements of all the witnesses reinforce the prosecution's claim that the conspiracy to attack was hatched in Pakistan
 magistrate ke bayaan se sabit hota he ki isamen lashkar e taiyaba kaa sansthaapak hafiz said kii bhoomika bhi thi
 Hearing in Noida's famous Aarushi murder case has been postponed in CBI court

 There was a lot of speculation in the court about the appearance of doctors Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar

 Also ordered the Talwar couple that the case be heard in the lower court

 Delhiites will not be able to beat to the tune of rock singer Brian Adams as the organizers who organized his show in Delhi have made it clear that Adams' program will no longer be held
 iske pehle yah saaf nahin tha ki mumbai or bangalore main pradarshan dene ke baad adams dilli main bhi kaarykram kar paaenge yaa nahin
 For this, the Delhi Police had attributed the security reasons
 netsurf intertenment ke prabandh nideshak sujith jain ne ek press vijyapti main kaha, ‘20 farvari ko punarnidhaarit kiya gaya bryan adams kaa kaarykram kuch taarkik kaarnon ke chalate radd kar diya gaya he
 ' upi main laalach dekar kuch muslim pariwaron kaa dharm badalane kii koshish kaa maamla lagaataar garmata ja rahaa he
 AIMIM MP in the Lok Sabha, Asaduddin Owaisi, alleged that both the BJP and the SP were merged and were merely doing nooriety
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki maamla saamne aane ke do din baad hi ection nahin liya gaya
 Pointing to SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, he said, 'if you and BJP are not united, you don't take action against RSS and Bajrang Dal? You stop giving nourishment
 'ovaisi ne apni aawaaj or talkh karte hue kaha, 'mujhe jitna fakhr hindustani hone par he, utana hi fakhr musalmaan hone par bhi he
 Neither Christians will be afraid, nor will Muslims be afraid
 aap lakh koshish kar lijie, ham majahab tabdeel karne vaale nahin hai
 If you want to save the country, stop your clowns, stop your spoons
 
 
 'iske jawaab main kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki dharmantaran ke mudde par raajnneeti karnaa galat he
 He said that the central government does not believe in discrimination
 vipaksh ke joardaar hangaame ke bich vankaiya naidu ne kaha, 'mujhe khud ke aresas becoground kaa hone par garv he

 saath saal baad 2013 main bangaloru main ek teen saal ke bachche kii daant ke ilaaj ke dauraan ensthesia kii sahi maatra na dene se maut ho gai
 But no one knows how many such cases have happened over the years
 ab aankade bolne lage hai or jaruri sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 Dr

 ashish jha ke 2013 ke adhyayan (asurakshit swasthya seva kaa vaishvik paridrishy) ke mutabik, duniya bhar main salanaa 42
 1 crore people are admitted in hospitals and around 4
 27 karod log chikitsakeey chook ke shikaar hote hai
 Two-thirds of these cases occur in low-income and middle-income countries
 bharat main aise maamle salanaa kareeb 52 lakh hai
 These include writing the wrong medicine, wrong amount of medicine, merging something and assuming something else, wrong surgery, wrong medicine at the wrong time
 logon main jaagrukta badaae ke saath-saath muaavje kaa daawa or mukademe bhi bad rahe hai
 Currently 3 in the consumer courts of the country
 5 lakh maamle lambit hai
 In such cases the Appellate Authority Registrar of Delhi Medical Council, Dr
 girish tyaagi ke mutabik, pichley do saal main maamle teji se bade hai yani har maheene 15 shikayaton se badhkar ab ye 40 ho gai hai
 These include cases ranging from high fees, absurd investigation, wrong doctor to wrong decision

 Inadequate law is a major problem that patients, doctors and hospitals get caught in a vicious cycle
 vellore ke chrishchiyan medical college ke lau officer samual abraham kehete hai, ‘‘doctor or nyaaypalika alag-alag bhashaa main bolte hai
 Generally, doctors behave courteously at the summons of the courts and the courts consider it to be a mistake
 ’’ zyaadaatar aspataalon main apane kanoonee adhikari nahin hai isliye maamle ulajh jate hai or lambey khinchate hai
 "the problem for most hospitals is that they don't even think about reconciliation," he says
 sarvice dene main thodi bhi kami rah gai ho to uski bharpai kii hi jaani chahie
 But after losing a place in the hospital, they keep on appealing and everyone is wasting time, energy and money
 ’’lekin lagata he ki kanoon main khaamiyon kii vajah se marij or doctor donon hi ke paas koi or rasta nahin bachataa
 Sushil Bajaj, a barrister at Integrated Law Consultancy in Delhi, says, "in India, the compensation for long-term medical negligence was not thought of
" uskaa dayera simit he or uske niyam nahin banaae gaye
 "currently, there are only two ways to get compensation
" ek, lau of tort (shaareerik kshati) or doosraa 1995 kaa upabhokta rahna kanoon (sipie)
 "but there are problems with both," he explains
 ’’ sipie main vastuon or sevaaon ke sabhi upabhoktaaon kii baat he
 In it, everything from a broken toaster to a patient dying of medical negligence is weighed in the same pan
 uski bhashaa bhi ‘‘gunvattta vaali seva’’ se sambandhit he jo chikitsakeey laaparvaahee kii baaten nahin karti
 He says, "so, judges have to do a lot of work
" haalanki unke paas chikitsa sambandhi maamalon kii baarikiyon main jane kaa na samay hota he, na visheshgyata
 There is not much possibility of cross examination
 aise main jaj sirf halafnaamon or reporton ko hi aadhaar banaate hai
 In the ordinary civil court, the patient-doctor case is viewed from the perspective of tort law
 bajaj kehete hai, ‘‘is maamle main bhi bharat main kanoon nahin banaae gaye hai
 "the biggest problem of the law is that nothing has been said about" fair compensation "
 ‘‘kunal saaha kaa maamla ek aadhaar banaata he kyonki pehali dfa hamane mana ki muaavje kii duusari mad bhi ho sakati hai
 It is necessary to look at modern references to tort
 ’’ ye paariwarik rishte se vanchit hone kii ‘‘kshatipurti’’ se lekar laaparvaahee ke liye ‘‘dand swaroop muaavja’’ or bhavishya kii galatiyon ko rokane ke liye ‘‘misaal ke rup main jurmaana’’ jaisaa ho saktaa he
 He believes that if the best doctor in the world also makes a mistake, he should also pay compensation once being a professional
 or yah muaavja paryaapt hona chahie
 He argues that after all, the "loser" must find a solution
 ’’uljhe halaat‘‘meraa anubhav doctoron ko apni raay dene se darayega
 This is called defensive treatment

 Director of Institute of Robotic Surgery and Head of Center for Chest Surgery and Lung Transplantation at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi
 arvind kumaar kehete hai, ‘‘mukademon kii baadh se chaaron ore baari dar baithne laga he
 All doctors realize the risk
 yahaan tak ki puri lagan or vivek se kaam karne vaale doctoron ko bhi mukademe kaa andeshaa bana rahata he
 "they tell that doctors are also terrified of touching patients with various problems
" jo mukademon main funs chuke hai ve hataash ho jate hai or aksar unamem aatmghaatee pravritiyaan ubhar aati hai
 The most adverse effect is seen in the relationship between the patient and the doctor
 kai doctoron ko puraa yakeen he ki marij aksar badhate bill ko dekhakar jaan-boojhkar hallaa machaana shuru karte hai
 Dr
 arvind kumaar kehete hai, ‘‘aise maamle puure desh khaskar mahanagaron main zyada ho rahe hai
 There is tremendous pressure on doctors
 koi bhi bura nateeja ‘‘chikitsakeey laaparvaahee’’ main darj kar liya jaataa he
 Relatives and friends of the patient often threaten to call television channels waving hospital bills
 ’’isse doctor badi rakam kii profeshnal indemnati policy lene par bhi majaboor ho rahe hai
 Convenor of medico-legal Group of Chandigarh, Dr

 The annual installment of Rs

 For this, the doctor will have to see a lot of patients daily and his fees will also have to increase a lot
 ‘‘mukademon ke badaae se har kisi ko apni jeb dhili kerani hogi
 "just like patients are both good and bad, in the same way, there are good doctors and bad doctors
" yah baat mushkil he ki kiskaa dukhada royaa jaae
 Was the cancer surgeon in Mumbai who, last year, said, "my successful career collapsed without a mistake," because he had declared a patient dead, but he came out alive? Or that person in Delhi, who has been fighting a case for years for not saying "sorry" to the doctor after the death of his cancer-stricken wife in the hospital? Everyday the matter is becoming more clear and it is the public's demand

 Kalra says, "this is becoming the biggest reason for change
" doctoron or aspataalon ko vahi karnaa hoga jo marij kii maang he
 "" Its results can be positive

 But only when patients can understand the danger of changing this balance
 kya doctoron or marij ke bich vishwaas ke mitane se kisi ko phayda hoga?mukademe kaa jaharek baar mukademe kaa dansh jhelane par doctor har maamle main dobaaraa sochate hai

" ’’beshak, chikitsakon ko peshey main galat or sahi ko nai roshni main dekhnaa hoga
 The matter is not just about money and money, but also the relationship between the patient and the doctor should be sacred

 After receiving the corpse, many questions arose, then the Adarsh nagar police immediately came on the defensive
 magar sawaal police kaa peechha nahin chhod rahe hai
 Adarsh nagar Police says that Sompal jumped down from the third or fourth floor of the police station to escape

 Fell to the ground uske donon ghutane tut gaye
 He went out but neither any policeman present in the police station heard nor heard his voice
 police kaa kahana he ki jis kamare main sompaal ko rakhaa gaya tha, wo lock nahin tha
 This is also very childish in itself because the police caught someone and made him sit in the police station just like that
 sompaal kilashsadak ke kinare kuch is tarah se mili thi ki aisa lage ki vah kisi durghatana kaa shikaar hua ho, lekin ab tak kii jaanch main diaiu kii team ko majalis park metro stesan ke paas se aisa koi suraag nahin mila he, jisase ye accident sabit ho sake

 Amid reports of a rift between BJP and Shiv Sena, Congress is also exploring possibilities in the state
 congress ke saamne aisi party kii ore dosti kaa haath kaa badhaane kaa vikalp he, jisane use hameshaa se apana ghanghor raajnneetik pratidwandi samajha he
 Shiv Sena founder Bala Saheb Thackeray has been aggressive and aggressive on the Congress during his lifetime, so the Congress is moving quickly towards any such option
 shuukravaar ko shivasena ke saath sambhavit dosti par charchaa karne ke liye maharashtra congress ke netaa antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi se milane aae the
 Sonia Gandhi, who had seen the Sena during the era of Balasaheb Thackeray, is not very enthusiastic about this political alliance, she has asked the party leaders to work on the policy of 'wait and watch'
 lambey intjaar ke baad congress netaaon se milin soniyashuukravaar ko maharashtra ke purv siem ashok chavaan, or prithviraj chavaan, maharashtra congress adhyaksh balasaheb thoraat, or maanik raav thakare milane aae the

 On this, Congress leaders told the party president that on many issues, it is more elegant for Congress to talk to Shiv Sena than BJP
 ram mandir kaa muddasonia or congress netaaon ke bich baatcheet ke dauraan ram mandir kaa mudda aayaa
 Please tell that the Shiv Sena has been taunting the Bharatiya Janata Party many times over the Ram temple issue
 isapar congress netaaon ne kaha ki ram mandir par supreme court kaa jo bhi faisla aayega use har party ko paalan karnaa hi padegaa
 What is the guarantee of joining the Shiv Sena? Sonia asked her party leaders if there was any guarantee that the Shiv Sena would come with the Congress by breaking the alliance with the BJP, because the Shiv Sena is the NDA constituent at the Center
 lambey manthan ke baad sonia ne congress ko kaha ki is mudde par party ko abhi or intjaar karnaa chahie

 retail main 100 ke aankade ko paar kar gaya pyaaj2
 Faced with a 5% tax, Lucknow vegetable vegetable prices have once again made everyone cry
 lanbaa arsa ho gaya lekin abhi pyaaj kii keemton main giravat ke koi asaar nahin dikh rahe
 Onion prices have now crossed Rs 100 in many places
 rajdhani dilli ho yaa lakhanu har ore retail bazaar main pyaaj kii keemat teen ankon yani 100 rupee ke aankade ko bhi paar kar chuki he
 2 in addition to onion shortage in Lucknow
 5 fisadi tex se bhi logon ko pareshaani ho rahi he
 First, let's talk about the capital Delhi, till yesterday the onion which was selling 75 to 80 rupees in the retail market
 wo pyaaj ab thok mandi main hi 80 se 90 rupee bik rahaa he
 The constantly increasing price of onions is becoming a big problem for the people
 thok mandi main 80 se 90 rupee kilo bikne vaala pyaaj retail bazaar main 110 se 120 rupee bik rahaa he
 Traders believe that onion prices will increase further in the coming days
 gajipur mandi ke esady gupta kehete hai ki yahaan pyaaj sirf rajasthan alvar kii mandi se hi aa rahaa he
 This is the only market in the country which is supplying onions all over the country, which is not being supplied
 aise main pyaaj ke daam lagaataar badhate ja rahe hai
 Shopkeepers say that they used to consume 15 to 20 trucks daily, but now only 1 to 2 trucks are coming in the market, which is too heavy for them to sell
 gujarat mandi se jald aayega pyaajdusari taraf asia kii sabase badi mandi ajadpur mandi main pyaaj 85 rupee kilo bik rahaa he
 Onion trader Rajendra Singh says that Rajasthan and Afghanistan onion is being sold in the market, which is priced from 55 to 85 rupees
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki agle 1 hafte main gujarat kaa pyaaj mandi main utarana shuru ho jayega jiske baad pyaaj ke daam kam ho sakate hai
 Vijender, a daily onion trader, says that a farmer who sells goods from the market is a broker and a trader who sells in the retail market is nervous at the moment
 pyaaj kii jo keemat 80 se 90 rupee thok mandi main he to kiraaya haada or mehtaanaa lagaakar yah pyaaj 100 se lekar 120 rupee tak retail market main bik rahaa he, lekin thok mandi se pyaaj le jaakar bechnaa retail bazaar ke kaarobaari ke liye bhi baari padataa najar aa rahaa he
 Businessmen say that now people are cutting down onion buying daily, stocking onion can prove fatal for them
 isliye vah pyaaj kaa stock rakhane se kataraa rahe hai
 Talking about the market of Lucknow and Lucknow, besides Delhi, the prices of onion are touching the sky, due to which the tears of both onion sellers and buyers are coming out in bulk
 thok par bechney waalon kii maane to 80 rupee kilo pyaaj pad rahaa he jisase khudara bazaar main 100 rupee kilo bik rahaa he
 Taxes will become cheaper, onions and bulk traders are able to supply and supply onions from outside by trucks because the onion coming from Bengaluru and Rajasthan has become very expensive due to which they have got two and a half percent to the government
 Separate tax has to be paid
 unki maane to agar dhai percent tex ko hataa liya jaae to pyaaj kii badi keemton se kuch raahat to milegi hi saath hi baahar se pyaaj laane par jab vah lakhanu tak pahunchataa he to tut-foot se nuksaan bhi jo jaataa he
 Because of which we do not profit at the rate at which we bring onions
 is vajah se hafte main ek hi baar abpyajalayaa ja rahaa he, vahiin kharidne waalon kii maane to pyaaj itnaa mahangaa he ki isko bech paanaa kaaphi mushkil ho rahaa he
 Now take a sack onion, then sell it for a week because the customer who used to take 2 kg onion earlier is taking only 250 gm or half kg
 isaki vajah se pyaaj bikri main kaaphi kami ai he
 Today, onion has become quite expensive and its conditions are not right now
 lakhanu ke thok vyapaaree rakesh kaa kahana he ki pyaaj bahut hi zyada mahangaa ho gaya he
 If we keep more onions then the government says that they are hoarding
 ham logon ne 30 se 40 rupee kilo main bhi pyaaj bechaa he, lekin aaj sthiti anukool nahin he

 Dawood Ibrahim's name is at number eight in India's 50 most wanted fugitives
 or vaise bhi is suchi ko waapas le liya gaya he
 Dawood's name is much lower than lashkar-e-taiba's chief Hafiz Saeed and isi's Major Sameer Ali
 vah ''mumbai main hatyaein karne ke iraade se bam visphot karaane kii sajeesh rachane'' ke maamle main vaanchit he
 Memories may blur nearly 18 years after the 1993 bombings that killed more than 250 people
 iesai ne daaud giroh ke sadasyon ko hathiyaar chalaane or visphotak lagane kaa prashikshan diya tha
 He had sent around 3 tons of RDX, AK-47 rifles and grenades
 phir bhi un visphoton ko iesai samarthit 26 / 11 ke hamalon jaisi aatankwaadi sajeesh ke vipareet saamaanya aapraadhik maamla mana jaataa he
 Because of this, India's case against Dawood has become weaker
 bhartiya khufia agency ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he, ''daaud par utana dhyaan nahin diya jaataa jitna hafiz mohammad said yaa moulana masood ajahar par diya jaataa he
 "that is because the Dawood gang is still considered a mafia gang, not a terrorist organization like lashkar-e-tayyaba or jaish-e-mohammed
" bharat kii pakistan ke saath koi pratyrpan sandhi nahin he
 There is another serious obstacle: Pakistan categorically denies that the gangster-terrorist is with it
 2002 ke agra shikhar sammelan se pehle raashtrapati parave
 j Musharraf told the then Home Minister LK Advani: "mr
 Advani, let me tell you clearly that Da Oud Ibrahim is not in Pakistan
" ''ek ore jahaan bharat ne donon deshon ke adhikariyon kii har mulaakaat main sabase vaanchhiton kii suchi thamana jari rakhaa he, vahiin pakistan daaud kii upasthiti se saaf inkaar karata rahaa he
 India has failed to put enough political pressure on Pakistan to extradite Dawood
 vah uske pratyrpan ke sabase kareeb 2003 or 2004 main us samay pahunchaa tha jab adwani ne daaud kaa maamla america ke saamne uthaaya tha
 The US Department of Finance, under an executive order, termed it as a 'specially designed global terrorist', which would have seized his assets in the US and banned his dealings with a US citizen
 kuch samay tak laga ki pakistan antat daaud kii maujuudagi ko sweekaar kar legaa lekin bharat se rajnatik dabaav kam hone ke saath hi vah phir purana raag alaapne laga
 Since then Dawood has been using its underworld network to carry out terrorist operations in India and increasing its share in fake Indian banknotes and hawala transactions for terrorist organizations
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki daaud ko us vishesh shrenee main daalane kaa maamla banataa he jisamen rashtriya suraksha ke liye khatarnaak logon ko rakhaa jaataa he
 Ajit Doval, former head of the Intelligence Bureau, says, "the US did not pursue Osama bin Laden just because he had conspired for the 9 / 11 attacks but was a clear and constant threat to him
" ''kanoon ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki daaud ko pratyrpit karaane ke duusare vikalp dhundhale padane ke saath hi bharat ko use pratyrpit karaane ke liye pakistan par america se dabaav dalwane kii jarurat he
 Ujjwal Nikam, Special Public Prosecutor in the 1993 blasts case, says, "america first declared Dawood an international terrorist, now India should tell America to pressurize Pakistan not to shelter it
" ''2006 main vishesh aatankwaad or vidhvansak gatividhi (nirodhak) kanoon (tada) adaalat ne mumbai hamale ke 129 main se 100 abhiyukton ko doshi qaraar dekar dandit kiya tha
 It is the longest running trial in the history of India
 bhartiya jaanchakarta sweekaar karte hai ki koi aisi jaanch nahin he jisamen 1993 ke visphoton ko nirnaayak taur par daaud se joda gaya he
 There is only a confessional statement linking Dawood to those blasts, in which a man confesses to the police that he saw Tiger Memon and three ignorant Pakistanis plotting the blast
 sibiai ke purv nideshak joginder singh kaa kahana he, ''agar ham daaud ko yahaan le bhi aaen to kya ham use 1993 ke visphoton ke maamle main doshi qaraar de sakate hai? hamaare paas police ke saamne diya gaya iklauta ikbaalia bayaan he jo adaalat main maanya nahin he

 He is honest and takes responsibility
 unhone loksabhaa chunaav ke baad (party ke kharaab pradarshan kii) jimmedaari lee or istipha de diya

 ' Senior journalist and editor Alok Mehta is the big face of television debates these days
 kalam kii tej dhar or chehre par mridu muskaan unki khaas pahchaan he
 Mehta has also been famous for her excellent relationship with clarity in her writing and ideas
 satta ho yaa vipaksh, ve chaahe jis bhi santhaan main rahe hon, unki patrakaariya nishpakshta par sawaal nahin uthe
 Not only in the journalistic world of the capital, in the political world, he has a lot of success today
 par is sampadak, patrkaar alok mehta kaa nirmaan ek din main nahin hua
 a long experience is also behind this
 saal 1971 main 'hindustan samachar' main sansadeey or raajnneetik maamalon ke reporter se patrakarita kii shuruyaat karne vaale mehta saal 1976 se 1979 tak dilli main 'saptahik hindustan' samvaadadaata ke rup main karyrat rahe
 In 1979, Mehta was selected as Editor in the Hindi Department of the Voice of Germany, Cologne, where he remained until 1982
 jab bharat laute to saptahik 'dinmaan' main raajnneetik samvaadadaata ke rup main kaary karne lage
 After contributing as local editor of 'navbharat Times' Patna from 1988 to 1993, he became the editor of 'navbharat Times News Service' in Delhi
 saal 1994 se sitambar 2000 tak 'dainik hindustan' ke kaaryakari sampadak rahe
 Was editor of 'dainik Bhaskar' from October 2000 to July 2002
 phir naiduniya dilli main kaarybhaar sambhalala, par isse pehle vah 'outluk saptahik' ke bhi sampadak rahe
 He was also the President of the Editors Guild of India
 is pad par chune jane vaale vah hindi ke pehle sampadak the
 Mehta was also a member of the Press Council of India
 iske alaava vah neshnal book trust, raja rammohan raay librari foundation or prem bhaatia memorial trust ke nyaasi ke saath-saath videsh mantralay kii hindi se judi salaahkaar samitiyon or unesco main bhartiya rashtriya ayog ke sadsy bhi rahe
 Alok Mehta was awarded the 'bharatendu Harishchandra Award' in 2006 on his book 'journalism's Laxman Rekha'
 isi varsh unhen hindi academy kaa 'sahityakar-patrkaar sammaan' tathaa uttarapradesh hindi santhaan ke pratishthit 'patrakarita bhushan puraskaar' se nawaja gaya
 He also received the 'turmeric Valley Honor' in the year 2007
 iske alaava vah 'rashtriya sadbhaavna puraskaar', 'rashtriya tulsi sammaan', 'indira priyadarshini puraskaar' tathaa 'sarvotkrisht patrakarita puraskaar' se bhi navaaje ja chuke hai
 In 1999, he was awarded the Delhi Academy's Best Writing Award on his book 'aastha Ka Aangan' and in 2004 the 'makhanlal Chaturvedi Journalism Award' of Sapre Museum Bhopal
 sahitya ajtak par padhie hindi patrakarita or sampadakon kii bhoomika par likhi unki pustak 'kalam ke senapati' kaa ansh
 This book is the story of the glorious era of Hindi journalism on the pretext of Mehta's memoirs as well as his business being transformed under market pressure
 pustak anshah kalam ke senapatikalam ke sipaahiyon kaa mahanayake senapati sampadak hi kaha ja saktaa he
 The era of swords, cannon, tanks, fighter aircraft or ships or missiles, the army personnel prepare continuously
 unhen yuddh avashya lagaataar nahin karne hote, lekin sampadak kaa vaicharik dwandv vyuh rachana, apni kalam ke chamatkaar dikhaate hue apni sampadakeey team ko nirantar sajag, sateek, sanyamit, dhardaar, eemaandaar, nishpaksh or safal banane kii chunauti har din bani rahati he
 There is a system of treatment as soon as the soldiers see the wounds, but it is not easy to see the pain and pain of the editor - it is very difficult to understand
 kalam ke chamatkaar dekhakar lakhon-karodon log abhibhoot hote hai, prashansa karte hai, asahmat rahane par aalochana bhi karte hai
 The editor's fairness and dignity consider him a 'star', but very few people get the inkling of his struggle
 apni 45 varshon se adhik lambi patrakarita yatra ke dauraan mujhe kam umr se sampadakon, prakashkon, maalikon, rajanetaaon ke saath najdiki sampark ke avasar mili hai
 Opportunities to work with the best editors and those who did not work as well, with many such senior editors being associated as active officers of the Editors Guild, provide information about the struggles behind their successes
 gine-chune nami sampadakon ne apni aatmakathaayen likhin, lekin adhikansh sampadakon ne akhbaar yaa pustak main nahin chhaapin
 The stories of the conflict were not kept in front of the world
 isliye chakachaundh vaale padon ke peeche rahe andheron, nukile panjon, kathinaaiyon, khataron kii jhalak bataanaa mujhe aavashyak lagata he
 At every step one has to cross the trench for the nectar vase
 shiv kii tarah swayan jehar pinaa padataa he
 Have to fall down
 antarman se ghayal rahakar baar-baar uthakar apni kalam se jinda rahane kaa ahsaas samaaj ko karwaanaa padataa he
 After taking a deep dip in the river one has to swim out and reach the shore
 sampadak kii daud, tairaaki, udaan kaa antim padaav kahin dikhataa hi nahin he
 The editor has a strong mindset of showing the edge of the pen till the last breath
 aazaadee ke aandolan kii patrakarita kii tulana karnaa mujhe na to uchit lagata he or na mere liye sambhav he
 Similarly, the impact of that journalism remained for 20-25 years after independence
 ise saubhaahgya hi kahuunga ki lagbhag 1970 se patrakarita main sampadakon ke utthan, sangharsh, jai-paraajay ko dekhne-samajhane ke avasar mili
 It would not be unfair to call it an era of revolutionary change in journalism
 sampadakon se har str par apekshaaon main bhi parivartan aayaa
 The roles were seen changing
 raajnneeti, satta, prabandhkeey puunji, karporate or bazaar kii maang, doordaraj ke pathakon kii pathakeey bhukhnpyas, apane hi saathiyon ke sahyog, virodh-daanvpench ko kareeb se dekhne, jhelane ke avasar mili hai
 First of all it is necessary to give a glimpse of the struggle journey associated with its editor Rajendra Mathur, one of the best Hindi editors of modern India
 indore ke pratishthit college main praadhyaapak rahete hue rajendra maathur ne pradesh ke pramukh akhbaar ‘naiduniya’ main likhnaa prarambh kiya
 His comments on national and international affairs surprised not only the readers, but also the managers and their senior partner Principal Editor Rahul Barpute
 isliye 1970 main akhbaar kii prishth sankhya 8 se 12 tak rakhane ke liye sampadakeey vistaar ke saath rajendra maathur ko praadhyaapak kii naukari chhod purnakalik sampadak ke rup main jod liya gaya
 a few months later, on the basis of a written competition in a workshop, i got an offer to join Ujjain as a deputy editor-reporter in the editorial department instead of a part-time reporter
 itani kam umr main itnaa aakarshak prastaav swikaarna hi tha
 Then there was the proud pleasure of Rajendra Mathur's first selected journalist
 sampadakeey vibhaag main simit staff ke baavjood british patrakarita kii tarah news or sampadakeey prishth kii saamagree ke liye subah-shaam kii baithkon main rajendra maathur kii adbhut sampadakeey netritv kshamta se bahut kuch seekhney ko miltaa
 Despite being the most junior and youngest, in a few months, Mathur Saheb entrusted the task of writing articles on the editorial page, with full page feature writing, page composition etc
 samachar or lekhan main sampoorn swatantraaa, lekin tathyon kii pushti evam painaapan rahete hue sanyamit bhashaa kaa prayog akhbaar kii pratishtha badhaata rahaa
 Thus, Rajendra Mathur had a close friendship with editorial colleagues Sharad Joshi and Prabhash Joshi before becoming full-time
 isliye raajnneetik-saamaajik antararashtriya vishyon par garmagarm bahes kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 In fact, Rajendra Mathur was associated with 'naiduniya' as a first part time assistant editor while being a professor of English at a college in Indore
 1970 main naukari chhodkar purnakalik sampadak bane
 Rahul Barpute, Rajendra Mathur, Abhay Chhajlani, Narendra Tiwari would come up with a definite opinion on several issues
 yah akhbaar laabhchand chhajalani, narendra tiwari or vasantilal sethiya ne milakar sthapit kiya tha
 Being a supportive supporter of the freedom movement had an impact on the newspaper and without investing money, editor Rahul Barpute's influence was nothing less than a boss-partner
 is drushti se rajendra maathur or abhaya chhajalani lagbhag samaan aayu varg ke kaaran sabake priy the or abhayaji kuch had tak pratiyogi maanate the
 Abhayji's role was in keeping with the daily coverage of the newspaper and also keeping pace with advertising
 is drushti se rajendra maathur vichaaron or samaacharon kii shreshthata par sarvaadhik dhyaan dete rahe
 The problem started when Rajendra Mathur started raising proposals to take the newspaper out of the territorial border
 santhaan ke paas puunji simit thi, lekin sampadakeey gunvattta shreshth thi
 i was young, but understood that Rajendra Mathur got more support from Narendra Tiwari and Rahul Barpute
 main to dedh varsh main itnaa sikh gaya or subah 10 se raat do baje tak kaam ke anubhav se mahasoos hua ki asli kaaryakshetra to desh kii rajdhani dilli hona chahie
 Rajendra Mathur and Abhay Chhajlani explained that Delhi is the ocean, identity will be lost there, but i thought it necessary to accept the challenge of becoming a correspondent in Hindusthan News Agency
 maathur sahab kaa aashirwad mila
 So he did not have to return after three months of probation
 rashtriya patrakarita ke sagar main laharon ke thapede khaaye, magaramchh to nahin ban sake, lekin duube bina pahchaan avashya bani rahi
 However, at this time the focal point is Rajendra Mathur
 1978 ke aasapaas navabharat times main jab prasiddh sampadaknsahityakar sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan sampadak bane, to unhone rajendra maathur ko sahaayak sampadak banakar aane kaa prastaav diya
 Had a nice chat prabandhakon ne sweekruti de di, lekin us kaal main times main bhi vetan kii seemaa thi
 The problem before Mathur was that his wife Smt
 Mohini Mathur was not able to meet the income due to the amount of salary he was getting in Indore as a college professor
 
 Despite being the most eminent in the Times, Agnay could not get his colleague to pay more than the limit
 unhone lekhak shaani or antararashtriya radio patrkaar gaurishankar joshi, pro
 The associates like Siddheshwar Prasad must have added, but the management did not even give the complete exemption to prepare a good team of correspondents for the expansion of Navbharat Times
 yah baat isliye jaanata hum ki agyeya ne mujhe or ramsharan joshi ko jodne ke liye prabandhan ke saath baithkar aupchaarik intervyuu bhi kar liya tha, lekin prabandhan ne baad main brake laga diya
 i was still working in Hindustan anyway and after a few months i moved to Cologne as the Hindi Editor of Radio Voice of Germany
 udhar der-saber rajendra maathur ko indore ‘naiduniya’ main rakhane ke liye 1981 main pradhan sampadak bana diya gaya, lekin unhen bhi vistaar ke bina chatapataahat hoti rahi
 Those who raise the issue of editorial supremacy after 1990 or 2000 should also look at such facts as Agnayya, Rajendra Mathur, Manohar Shyam Joshi, S
K
 nihaal singh, kuldeep naiyar, bi
 Yes
 vargeez, khushvanth singh jaise nami sampadakon ko bhi prabandhkeey simaaon se nipatna padataa tha or der-saber santhaan chhodane bhi pade
 In the early months of 1982, managerial preparations started in the Times also to improve the Navbharat Times
 nayi printing press kharidne kii sambhaavna ko dhyaan main rakhkar germany ke duusaldorf shahar main hone vaale printing mashiinon ke vyapaar meley ‘droopa’ ke liye times ke mahaprabandhak rameshchandra colon pahunche
 At the same time, there were long discussions on the change of Navbharat Times during the meal at my friend Madhusudan Anand and my house
 ham log bhi pardes se waapas swadesh jane ke mood main the
 Like Indore, i also saw limited scope for Hindi journalism in Cologne
 tabhi yah baat bhi hui ki 1978 main na sahi, 1982 main to times rajendra maathur ko sampadak ke rup main uchit vetan ke saath laa saktaa he
 Even then i had not resigned from the weekly Hindustan and i could go there, but i also agreed to join the Times when Mathur saheb came
 july, 1982 main ghar vaapasi hui, to indore main maathur sahab se mulaakaat hui
 He admitted that he was ready to appear in 'navbharat Times', but a few months later
 aisi sthiti main tab tak mujhe ‘dinmaan’ main mil rahe raajnneetik samvaadadaata kaa pad sweekaar lenaa chahie
 i did the same thing
 jab rajendra maathur oktober main ‘navabharat times’ ke sampadak banakar aa gayi, to ‘dinmaan’ main rahete unhone meri khabaren ‘navabharat times’ main chhapni shuru kar deen
 It is natural that this initiative caused great pain to the old colleagues of the old leaked 'navbharat Times'
 baharhaal, maathur sahab to akhbaar ke kayakalp ke liye aaye the
 He opened up all fronts to replace stereotyped journalism like old machines
 lagbhag ek varsh ke interval main mujhe vishesh samvaadadaata ke rup main ‘navabharat times’ main khinch laaye
 The specialty of Rajendra Mathur was that no matter what the views or relations of politicians or managers were, they did not let the impartiality and sharpness of their speech fall short
 parichit mukhyamantri, kendriya mantri yaa vipaksh kaa netaa ho- milanaa chaahe to daftar yaa ghar ke daravaaje bhi khule rakhkar chaay par swaagat karte, lekin vipareet tathy hone par unheen netaaon kii asaliyat, gadabadiyaan ujagar karne vaali pramanik khabar yaa aalochanatmak tippanee likhane-likhavane-chhapane main tanik sankoch nahin karte the
 That is why Congress, Sanghbhajpa, Socialist, Communist thought leaders or supporters always remain in confusion
 sampadak kii tarif karen yaa ninda? sahi arthon main aatank failaaye bina satta vyavastha ko aainaa dikhaane kaa kaam rajendra maathur kii patrakarita ne kiya
 Two or three stories related to ourselves
 satta se jude chandraswami kaa asli naam nemichand jain tha
 Therefore, he had also made some connections with the Jain family, the owner of the Times, and occasionally stayed in his bungalow's guestroom
 ek baar maine chandraswami ke raajnneetik shadyantron ko ujagar karne vaali visphotak khabar likhi
 The first news editor Parsadas Jain got an eye
 ve daudte hue meri mej ke paas aakar bole, ‘jaanate hai, yah koun he ?’ maine sahajata se kaha, ‘haa, varshon se jaanata hum, raajnneetigyon ko thagne vaala chandraswami
 'the news editor said annoyingly,' Hey brother, just think, whatever it is, it also stays in the owners' guest house
 samajhate ho, chhapane par kya hoga?’ maine phir sahajata se uttar diya, ‘kya hoga, yah maathur sahab jaane
 i told them
 ab aap likhi hui report unhen dikhaa dijie
 If they do not think it is appropriate, they will tear and throw it away
 mujhe koi aapatti nahin hogi
 i only know the editor
 chandraswami yaa maalikon se mujhe kya lenaa-dena
 'I said my point and left
 samachar sampadak ne maathur sahab ke saamne jaakar apni baat kahi or report kii kapi dikhaa di
 Mathur saheb read the 'tick' without cutting anything and said that you print it
 ab unase bahes kii himmat kise hoti? ab waisi ek nahin, kam se kam paanch-saat khabaren chandraswami ke bhandaphod par chhapin
 i never got to know if he had any talk with the management
 yah thi nirbhik patrakarita kii misaal
 The second anecdote is connected to Rashtrapati Bhavan
 gyani gel singh raashtrapati the
 He had great respect and affection with Hindi editors and journalists
 ‘navabharat times’ ke sampadak ke naate rajendra maathur kii izzat karte the or niyamit rup se akhbaar bhi padhate the
 Sharad Joshi also used to make sarcastic remarks about Gyanji in the column of satire
 vishesh samvaadadaataaon ke santhaan press association ke padaadhikari ke naate ek baar jab maine aagrah kiya to gyaniji ne sabhi rajdhani ke vishesh samvaadadaataaon ko sapatnik shaam ko chaay or alpaahar par aamantrit bhi kiya, lekin ekedo varsh baad hi punjab main aatankwaadi ghatnaayen badhane ke baad maine ‘navabharat times’ ke liye ek report likhi, jisamen raashtrapati bhawan main aatankwaadi gatividhiyon se jude ek vyakti ko atithi kaksh main rakhe jane jaisi gambheer soochnaaon kaa vivaran tha
 Mathur saheb did not cut a single line in that report and the news was prominently printed on the first page
 sidhe gyaniji ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya gaya tha, lekin raashtrapati bhawan ke press sachiv gyaniji ke varisht vishwasaneey sahyogi kaa naam usamen aayaa tha
 This news was also taken from the case taken by the government's Enforcement Directorate to the court
 isliye isaki pramanikta par koi prashnchihn nahin tha, lekin bharat main sambhavtah yah pehla avasar tha, jabaki sidhe raashtrapati bhawan or aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ke sutron kaa sansanikhej rahasyodghatan kisi akhbaar main prakashit hua
 The ruckus was natural
 agle din pradhan sampadak ke alaava company ke adhyaksh or kaaryakari nideshak tak raashtrapati bhawan se naaraazgi pahunchaai gayi, lekin vah rajendra maathur hi the, jinhone is mudde par nidarta dikhaayi or kisi tarah kii kshamaa-yachana yaa bhul-sudhaar jaisi baat nahin chhaapi
 Similarly, during the period 1985-86, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had very good relations with the Jain or Dalmia families
 hindi akhbaar hone ke naate dharm sambandhi khabaren, pravachan yaa lekh aadi bhi chhapate rahe, lekin unheen dinon vishwa hindu parishad ke hisaab-kitaab main gadabadi ko lekar ke ek chartered acountint kii report ke hawaale se vistrut khabar likh di or maathur sahab ne chhap di
 People grieved from the bottom to the top
 gwalior ke sindhiya parivaar se jude sardaar ongre kaa zikr bhi us report main tha
 Sardar Angre, the princely litterateur, through an acquaintance also sent a threat that the writing would crush the reporter or editor with a truck, but Mathur Sahib laughed it off and said that now the king-maharaja is nobody, any of the Sardars There cannot be panic
 is maamle main bhi kisi tarah kaa spashtikaran nahin chhapana padaa
 Mathur saheb's very sharp remarks about terrorism in Punjab kept threatening letters from angry organizations
 maathur sahab ko sarkaar se suraksha lene tak kii salaah di gayi, lekin unhone ise sweekaar nahin kiya
 Apart from his car, he did not worry about going to his house by normal bus if needed
 arjuna singh, narayandutt tiwari yaa laalkrishna adwani jaise varisht netaa vyaktigat rup se maathur sahab se sammanpurvak milte the
 Arjun Singh was familiar with him only from Madhya Pradesh
 meraa bhi arjuna singh se acha-khaasaa parichay tha, lekin 1987 ke aasapaas arjuna singh ke churhat vidhansabha kshetra main chunaav ke dauraan maine unke samarthakon dwaara kii ja rahi jyadatiyon ko lekar ek ankhon dekhi report ‘navabharat times’ ke liye likhi or maathur sahab ne use pehle prishth par pramukhataa ke saath prakashit kiya
 Similarly, i wrote a long and detailed report with photos of Arjun Singh being the Governor of Punjab, near his grand building being built near the Kerwa Dam in Bhopal and was appreciated by Mathur Saheb
 kabhi yah ahsaas nahin ho paaya ki arjuna singh ne apni aprasannataa kis tarah kitni vyakt kii
 The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh were also very pleased with the sharp remarks of Mathur Saheb for nationalist views on the situation in Punjab
 kendra main congress kii sarkaar bhi aatankwaad se ladane ke kaaran unke vichaaron se sahmati vyakt karti thi, lekin adwani kii rathyatra ko lekar maathur sahab ne mandir se adhik raashtra kii raksha ke muddon par bebaak dhang se likhaa
 Meaning LK Advani's entire program was criticized
 vahiin maathur sahab ne unki rathyatra kii khabaron yaa uske samarthan main sampadakeey sahyogi dwaara likhe gayi lekh ko prakashit karne main kabhi koi anakani nahin kii
 Similarly, on serious cases of corruption in the purchase of Bofors cannon, Mathur sailed the Congress Government on serious cases of corruption
 boforce cond main dallali se jude kai naye tathyon se bhari meri khabaren bhi lagaataar akhbaar main pramukhataa se chhapate rahe
 Many people have the impression that the newspaper is supporting Vishwanath Pratap Singh due to his associate executive editor Surendra Pratap Singh by Mathur Saheb
 kuch dinon baad vishwanath pratap singh pradhanmantri bhi ban gayi or mandal ayog kii report lagu karne se desh bhar main aandolan kii aag faili, tab surendra pratap singh or kuch anya sahyogi mandal ayog kii report ke samarthan main lekh likhte rahe
 Rambahadur Rai, working in the bureau, kept writing reports while accompanying the visit of Vishwanath Pratap Singh, but Mathur Saheb himself continued to write prominently in his editorial comments and some other colleagues or writers who were critical
 ve ise loktantric patrakarita kii sangya dete the
 Mathur saheb made some sarcastic remarks in his speech when Chandrashekhar became the Prime Minister in his presence at a function of the Times Institute
 je
 P
 aandolan or loktantric abhivyakti ke samarthak hone ke baavjood chandrasekhar saral-sahaj swabhaav se kii gayi tippanee ko bardaasht nahin kar sake or agle din prabandhakon ke samaksh apana kadaa virodh prakat kiya
 The managers conveyed their displeasure to Mathur Sahib
 samvedansheel maathur sahab ko yah jaanakar behad dukh hua
 He did not expect such from Chandrasekhar
 vah andar hi andar duhkhi rahe
 On the other hand, editorial colleagues having good relations with Vishwanath Pratap Singh and Chandrashekhar, in their own way, also expressed their disagreements about the leadership of Mathur Saheb to the management
 durbhaagya yah tha ki jin varisht sahyogiyon ko maathur sahab ne hi akhbaar ke saath joda tha, ve apane nijee swaarthon ke liye jane-anjaane maathur sahab ko kinare karne ke abhiyaan chalaate rahe
 a major change in 'navbharat Times' was giving Hindi journalism a new direction
 rajendra maathur ke prastaavon or prayaason ko prabandhan kaa samarthan mil rahaa tha
 Hence newspaper editions from Lucknow, Patna and Jaipur also started
 mumbai main to pehle se hi sanskaran tha
 Mathur Saheb kept saying inside the office and also in public forums that a newspaper can claim to be a national newspaper only if there are editions in most states of the country
 vah dakshin ke rajyon main bhi hyderabad, bangalore or purvi rajyon main pashchim bengal yani kolkata main ‘navabharat times’ kii upasthiti dekhnaa chaahate the
 Being initially a neighboring country at the international level, he also had a desire to have his correspondents in Pakistan
 isi kram main unhone mujhase bhi kaha tha ki kya main pakistan jane ko taiyaar ho jaaoongaa? maine unke aadesh par kahin bhi jane ke liye apni sweekruti di hui thi
 Due to diplomatic differences and limitations, it was not possible, but the pressures of politics and unionism were put more by the pressures than the management of Lucknow, Jaipur and Patna editions
 times main vistaar ke saath vibhinn vibhaagon ke liye naye-naye prabandhak bhi bhartee hue the
 People with good MBA education and marketing of consumer goods also criticized media institutions in their own way
 iskaa bhi dilachasp kissa he
 Rajendra Mathur stayed in Lucknow for a few weeks continuously to launch the Lucknow edition
 unke thaharne kii vyavastha to ek achche hotel main thi, jiskaa kharch company uthaa rahi thi
 Working with his editorial colleagues from morning till late at night, Mathur Saheb used to go to a dhaba and dine around the office
 ekaadh maheene ke baad unki lakhanu yatra ke bill jab prabandhan ke paas pahunche to haath se likhe dhabas ke bilon par yah aapatti saamne aayi ki hotel ke kharch kii to purv sweekruti thi, lekin dhabas ke bilon par purv sweekruti nahin thi
 The ridiculous thing was that the hotel accommodation bill was in the hundreds of rupees and the dhaba bills were only between four and six hundred rupees
 is par maathur sahab uttejit nahin hue
 He laughed and asked his assistant to get approval from Ramesh Chandra or Account General Manager for this, the young managers could not understand their way
 prabandhan main santhaan ke adhyaksh ashok jain or yuva upaadhyaksh samir jain rajendra maathur kaa bahut sammaan karte the
 Sameer Jain also used to discuss with Mathur Sahab for two hours to resolve his doubts
 duusari taraf patna sanskaran main deenanath mishra ko sthaneey sampadak niyukt kiye jane par unheen ke puraane sahyogi or samaan vichaaron vaale nandakishor trikha ne baqayada apni neshnal union of jarnlist kii taraf se prabandhan ko virodh kii lambi-chaudee chitthee bhej di
 The decision to send Dinanath Mishra to that protest did not change, but Mathur saheb and i were deeply saddened by the mutual acrimony of the journalists
 avasar aane par ek baar maine usee union kii baithak ke liye is tarah kii gatividhiyon par apana virodh bhi pahunchaaya
 Mathur Sahib also faced opposition from the Times Union for editorial changes in the initial months
 jo patrkaar din bhar taale kii dukaan chalaakar shaam ko akhbaar main reporter ke rup main khanaapurti ke baad tankhwaah lete the, unhen nayi sampadakeey nitiyon se dukandaaree band hone kii samasya khadi ho gayi thi
 One such journalist, being active in municipal politics, used to get his full salary even when he came to the office for only two or four days, he also faced a lot of trouble when he was asked to work, but the impact of such holiday protest and unionism Neither happened on Mathur Sahab nor on management, but around 1990 senior colleagues blew the idea in Sameer Jain's mind that 'navbharat Times' along with 'times of India' Also, a Hindi version of the Times should be extracted separately to bring the content to the market
 us samay ‘navabharat times’ main times kii ekaadh koi vishesh khabar hone par avashya chap jaati thi, lekin apni moulikta banaaye hui thi
 i was introduced to him when Surendra Pratap Singh was in 'dharmayuga'
 jab vah ravivaar main sampadak bane, tab main ‘saptahik hindustan’ main rahete hue unke vishesh aagrah or manohar shyaam joshi kii anumati se kabhi-kabhaar raajnneetik report bhi ravivaar ke liye likh detaa tha
 Even from Germany, i wrote some features for Sunday
 isi tarah rajendra maathur bhi ravivaar main surendra pratap singh kii safalataa se prabhavit the
 So when Surendra Pratap Singh wrote a letter to Mathur Saheb to join the Navbharat Times, Mathur Sahib made a role to bring him
 lakhanu sanskaran main rakhane ke liye der ho chuki thi, lekin mumbai sanskaran main sthaan hone par surendra pratap singh ko mumbai sanskaran kaa sthaneey sampadak niyukt kar diya gaya
 From the point of view of English newspapers, the headquarters of the Times was considered to be Mumbai at that time
 isliye samir jain bhi kuch din mumbai main hi bitaate the
 At the same time, Surendra Pratap Singh tried to impress Sameer Jain on the formula of editorial quality and high profits through marketing
 isi vajah se ek-dedh varsh baad es
 P
 singh ko dilli sthaanantarit kar kaaryakari sampadak bana diya gaya
 This helped to replace the loose-style work of the pre-1982 team
 surendra pratap singh ke santhaan main aane se pehle bhi ek baar maine samir jain ko navabharat times ke aadhunikeekaran kii drushti se maathur sahab ke saath kisi kaaryakari sampadak ko rakhe jane or kuch anya parivartanon ke suzav kaa ek patr diya tha
 Then Sameer Jain had told me that i have more importance to increase his income than what is printed in the newspaper
 prabandhan kaa kaam akhbaar kii copy ginana nahin, balance shit ko majboot hote dekhnaa he, lekin isamen koi shaq nahin ki samir jain gunvattta ko banaaye rakhkar adhikadhik munafa badhanaa chaahate the
 From the point of view of age and experience, he used to express his disagreements with Rajendra Mathur and Girilal Jain, but was not able to make any direct intervention
 navabharat times main surendra pratap singh or times main dilip padaganvkar ke jariye samir jain ko apane formulon par amal main suvidha dikhne lagi
 Therefore, he decided to implement the translated newspaper of the Times
 surendra pratap singh ne to ek baar yah suzav diya tha ki maathur sahab ek bade buddhijivi sampadak hai, isliye unhen navabharat times ke bajaay readers diguest jaisi ek shreshthatam patrika nikaalane kaa daayitv saunp diya jaae, lekin dharmayug or dinmaan ke rahete company ke adhyaksh yaa kaaryakari nideshak is tarah kii patrika ke liye sahamat nahin ho sakate the
 Then the assistant editor Vishnu Khare, who was brought by Mathur Saheb, was cleverly forwarded to the translated newspaper of the Times
 vishnu khare ke saath do sahaayak sampadakon kii bhi niyukti kar di gayi
 There was no discussion with Rajendra Mathur for this plan of translated newspaper
 apane hi santhaan main is tarah ke akhbaar nikaale jane kii taiyaari par maathur sahab or rameshchandra jain behad duhkhi the
 This unhappiness also reached the company president Ashok Jain and after a few months it was completely put on hold
 vah anudit akhbaar kabhi nahin niklaa, lekin maathur sahab ke nidhan ke baad anuwaad or masaaledaar banaakar nabhata bradshit rahete hue teblide style kaa ho gaya
 It also seems necessary to mention some events between 1988–1991
 patna sanskaran kii katipay vifaltaaon or kuch gambheer shikayaton ke kaaran maathur sahab ne sthaneey sampadak badalane ke surendra pratap singh ke prastaav ko sweekruti di
 Surendra Pratap Singh proposed to place Arun Ranjan, who was already working there for the local editor, but Mathur Saheb considered Bihar as a big challenge, so he offered me to handle the Patna version
 surendra pratap singh or kuch anya sahyogi shaayad yah nahin chaahate the
 He did not express direct opposition to Mathur Saheb, but kept many arguments till Sameer Jain
 unamem ek haasyaaspad tark yah bhi tha ki ek sangeet kii mehfil main pakistan ke rajanyikon ke saath alok mehta baithe hue the or uske pramaan ke rup main photo bhi mila hua he
 This means that they do not know whether their relations are related to any agency of Pakistan
 usee times prabandhan ke samaksh pehle kabhi yah shikaayat kii gayi thi ki hindusthan samachar main rahane ke kaaran mere gahare sambandh rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se rahe honge
 Rajendra Mathur and Rameshchandra ji used to laugh at such ridiculous things
 isliye patna sambandhi prastaav bhi do-teen maheene tak lataka rahaa, lekin antatogatva adhyaksh ashok jain ne maathur sahab kii sifarish par mujhe hi patna bhejne kii sweekruti de di
 a few months later, three to four new deputy editors and correspondents were to be placed in the Patna edition
 tab pradhan sampadak ke naate rajendra maathur swayan patna pahunche or kareeb 30 logon kii likhit pariksha lee
 Then in the interview, i and the general manager of Patna sat together and picked four young journalists
 sthaneey str par unhen niyukti patr bhi de die gayi
 About two weeks later Nandita Jain (daughter of Ashok Jain), in charge of the regional editions of the Times, was informed through Surendra Pratap Singh that there were four new appointments in Patna
 nanditaji ne mujhe phone kar poocha ki vahaan chaar nayi niyuktiyaan kaise hurin? maine unhen bataaya ki rajendra maathur ne pariksha or intervyuu ke baad unka chayan kiya or ve kaam karne lage hai
 In those days there was no mobile and only a few minutes could be talked on a normal phone
 isliye nanditaji ne sankshep main hi kuch tikhe andaaj main kaha ki rajendra maathur niyukt karne vaale koun hote hai ? maine apni taraf se unhen uttar diya ki pradhan sampadak ke naate main to sirf rajendra maathur ko hi jaanata hum
 Must be doing the same with management
 iske liye aap unheen se samaj sakati hai ki niyuktiyaan kaise hurin
 Nanditaji said in the tone of the order that those people should be relieved by four o'clock this evening
 unhone phone rakh diya
 After a while i called Mathur Saheb and said that i want to send my resignation on Telex
 unhone kaaran jaananaa chaha, to maine unhen bataaya ki nandita jain aapako hi jaanane se inkaar karti hai, to mere rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 i only know you
 maathur sahab ne tatkaal badi gambheertha ke saath kaha ki aap kuch nahin karenge
 You sit quietly, whatever i want to do, i will do it
 sambhavtah unhone ashok jain or kaaryakari nideshak rameshchandra jain ko is tarah ke hastkshep kii jaankaree di
 Both of them also expressed their displeasure over such a thing and said that you should inform Patna that there is no need to remove the newly appointed people
 is tarah maamla thanda ho gaya
 At that time, the companies associated with the Times Institute used to have sugar mills and a pilgrimage center of Jainism also used to come in the United Bihar region
 isliye prabandhan kii gahari ruchi bhi bihar main thi, lekin kisi tarah kaa hastkshep nahin hota tha
 We were the first to publish the authentic and documentary news exposing the much talked about fodder scandal
 tab tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav ke samarthakon ne times kii printing unit par hamalaa kar aag lagane kaa prayaas bhi kiya, lekin rajendra maathur kii sampadakeey dridhtaa kaa hi nateeja tha ki mujhe yaa kisi sampadakeey sahyogi ko prabandhan se kabhi kisi hastkshep yaa virodh kii soochna nahin mili
 Some top colleagues, journalists and managers took undue advantage of Rajendra Mathur's democratic nature
 yahi nahin, maalikon ko khush karne ke liye ghatiya str ke chote-chote adnge lagaaye
 Due to external political commitments and selfishness, they continued to benefit from the system
 maathur sahab raashtrapatiyon-pradhanmantriyon, company ke maalikon ke saamne spasht kadavi baaten likh yaa bol sakate the, lekin apane-paraaye kahalaane vaale kuch logon kii dushtataa par andar hi andar duhkhi hote the
 Probably many things must have been told to Mrs
 Mohini Mathur or deep friend Sharad Joshi
 daawa to nahin kar saktaa, lekin pehla param shishy hone ke naate man kii kuch baaten mujhe bhi suna-samajha dete the
 Saddened by the internal tussle and external environment of the company, he once told me that if i leave the Times Group in case of water rising above the head, i will write a column like Khushwant Singh
 ’ matlab shadyantron yaa matibhrasht ke kaaran company unhen kahin kinare baitaane kii koshish karti, to vah tatkaal istipha de dete
 On the other hand, colleagues like us were also realizing that some of the efforts and talks of his oldest friend Prabhash Joshi were hurt
 antim kuch varshon main prabhashji kaa unke ghar aana aghoshit varjit sa tha
 Prabhash Joshi and some of his most dear companions, Mathur Sahib, considered Prabhash Joshi to be a very successful editor instead
 aise andaruni ghaavon ke kaaran sanvadensheel maathur sahab keval 56 varsh kii aayu main aakasmik heart atake ke kaaran is duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Navbharat Times became like an orphan after his departure, it became a bit of a fuss for the progress of the best Hindi journalism
 nidhan se dedh maheene pehle hi unhone sari adngebaaji ke baavjood prabandhan se meraa tabadalaa dilli kara diya tha, lekin unke bina akhbaar ke sampoorn dhaanche ko surakshit rakh paane kii shakti kisi ke paas nahin thi
 In fact, any management can be said to be concerned about profitability, because in the present era most companies do not run news institutions to bring service and social awareness like the 'gandhi-nehru' era
 teen peediyaan nikal gayin, lekin patrakaron-sampadakon kii mahattvakankshaon, swaarthon, swamibhakti ityadi se sampadak kii sanstha or sampoorn patrakarita ko adhik nuksaan hota rahaa he
 Navbharat Times is also the result of the same situation
 maathur sahab ke baad times samooh ne kisi ko pradhan sampadak to kya ghoshit ek sampadak tak niyukt nahin kiya
 Due to rules and regulations, the mention of local editor or executive editor responsible for news and delhi-mumbai market started appearing in the print line in minimum 8 points
 kaaryakari sampadak ke rup main es
 P
 singh samir jain ke bhi sabase kareebi the, lekin unhen company main nideshak pad tak kaa prastaav kiya gaya, ecchhatra sampadak nahin banaaya
 S
 a few months later
 pi
 Singh resigned
 aisa nahin tha ki yah gaaj keval hindi akhbaar par padi, bagal main baithe times aaf india ke ati mahattvakankshi sampadakon kaa bhi vahi hashr hua
 Those who, along with senior colleague Dilip Padgaonkar, exposed the shortcomings of Editor Girilal Jain to Sameerji or his managers, could never in the true sense get the post of Girilal Jain's stature
 kabhi unhen kaaryakari sampadak, kabhi salaahkaar sampadak jaise padon ke saath baari-bharkam tankhwaah avashya company detii rahi
 Therefore, instead of blaming the owners, journalists and editors should consider the damage caused by their actions, utterances, internal attacks

 state bank of hyderabad ne 31 march, 2011 ko samaapt vittvarsh main shuddh munaafe main 42 pratishat vruddhi darj kii he

 The maximum sentence of a minor to the greatest offense can also be only three years
 yahi maujuuda kanoon he
 The court said that the Juvenile Justice Board should constitute a committee

 This committee may also include ngos and social workers

 Mayawati has said that after staying in power for more than four years, she has been informed about the development of Rae Bareli today
 mayawati ne kaha ki congress kii rail coach industry maamle ko tool dekar aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main laabh uthaanaa chaahati he
 Addressing a press conference in Lucknow, Mayawati said that raising the issue of the rail coach industry right before the Lok Sabha elections is a part of the dirty politics of the Congress
 mayawati ne sawaal kiya ki raibareli ke vikaas ko lekar phikrmand sonia gandhi bataaen ki aakhir pichley chaar saalon main unhone jile jile ke kitne logon ko rojgaar muhaiyaa karaayaa
 The BSP supremo said that the Congress, which called our government anti-development, should first look into its predecessor whether it is not anti-development to obstruct projects like Ganga Expressway, Yamuna Expressway and Hindon Expressway
 Mayawati said that the UPA government at the Center has been dealing with our government in Uttar Pradesh from the very beginning
 thane police ne 13 varshiya ‘kho kho’ khilaadi kii sadak durghatana main maut ke maamle main uske team manager par cese darj kar liya he
 This is the first case of its kind that a case has been registered against the manager of his team for the death of a player in a road accident
 31 janvari 2016 ko ghodbandar road par hue sadak haadase main kho kho khilaadi karthik hardaas kii maut hui thi
 Karthik, who lived with his family in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, was the only child of his parents
 ahmednagar ke kho kho khilaadiyon kii team main karthik shaamil tha
 The manager of this team was Sumit Chavan
 haadase ke vakt 19 saal kaa sumit ab 21 saal kaa he
 Sumit, who became the manager of the team at such a young age, belonged to a poor family
 wo chahta tha ki uski team bahut saare toornament jite or rashtriya str par use pahchaan mili
 Sumit wanted to be recognized as a big coach
 janvari 2016 main thane main ‘meyar arts and sports meet’ kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The Kho Kho team from Ahmednagar also went to participate in it
 team main karthik samet 11 khilaadi the
 Only players under 14 years of age could participate in this tournament
 team ke saath coach ke taur par sumit bhi saath tha
 How the accident happened? The lost Kho team from Ahmednagar was staying in a building on Ghodbunder Road
 haadase ke din raat 11 baje team ke sadasyon ne sadak ke paar ja kar mal main icecream khaane kaa faisla kiya
 There was no overbridge or signal to cross the road outside the building where the team was stationed
 sadak ke bich main ooncha divyder tha
 In such a situation, the team members made a pair of two and crossed the divider and went to the other side of the road
 sumit bhi saath tha
 When he was returning after eating ice cream at the mall, Karthik's balance on the divider deteriorated and he fell down the road
 tabhi vahaan raftaar se aa rahi car ne karthik ko kuchal diya
 Karthik was rushed to the hospital where he died during treatment
 durghatana ke vakt koi sisitivi aasapaas maujuud nahin tha
 After receiving information about the accident, the Mayor of Thane expressed grief over the death of Karthik
 saath hi uske parivaar ko ek lakh rupye kii madad kaa elaan kiya
 Kapurbavadi police station lodged an FIR against the unknown car driver
 is agyaat driver kaa abhi tak pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 Karthik's father blamed Sumit, though Karthik's father Baba Saheb blamed team manager Sumit for the death of his son
 baba sahib kaa kahana he ki team ko bas kii suvidha mili hui thi
 Then why not use the bus to go to the mall on the day of the accident
 baba sahib kaa kahana he ki manager ke naate team ke sabhi sadasyon kii suraksha kii jimmedaari uski thi, phir kyon nahin usne saavdhaanee barti
 Why didn't the team cross the road by signal or zebra crossing? According to a police officer, Karthik's father sent 21 complaint letters to the police in this case
 karrwai ke dabaav main police ne haal main vakeelon se raay lee or haadase ke do saal baad nayaa cese darj kiya
 In the new case, the police have charged Sumit with cruelty against the child under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 and endangering human life under Section 336 of the IPC
 police ne do saal pehle jo maamla darj kiya tha usamen agyaat car driver ko ipisi kii dhara 304 e ke tahat aaropee banaaya tha
 The issue of debate in this case is how Sumit is responsible for Karthik's death
 sadak par raftaar se aa rahi kaarne karthik kii jaan lee
 Some teachers and coaches are also considering this incident as an accident, they do not agree to blame coach Sumit for negligence
 is haadase ko lekar kuch bhi tark die jaaen lekin sachai ye he ki karthik ko kuchalane vaali car kaa driver kaa abhi tak koi pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 While Karthik was snatched away, the budding coach is facing a legal battle

 vishwa cap vijeta captain kapil dev ne kaha ki viraat kohli kii farm chintaa kaa vishay nahin he kyonki aagaamee champiens trophy main bharat kaa bhagya sirf bhartiya captain par hi nirbhar nahin he
 The Champions Trophy will start in the first week of June in Inland and Kohli is unable to score much runs in the current IPL
 kohli kii farm se pratishthit vanade toornament main bharat ke abhiyaan ko asar padegaa to1983vishwa cap vijeta captain kapil ne kaha, ‘kya aapane dharmashala main austrailia ke khilaaf test match dekha?har kisi ne kaha tha ki agar kohli nahin khelte hai to bharat haar jaayegaa
 But we know what happened
 ’unhone kaha, ‘team ke anya sadasyon ko yah sochate hue is tarah kamatar aankna ki bharat kaa bhagya sirf un (kohli) par nirbhar he to yah kahana anuchit he
 The former 58-year-old all-rounder said, "kohli is an important member of the team, he is a big player and he knows how to play and when to play
 ’madam tusaad dilli main kapil kii mom kii murti kaa anaavaran kiya gaya
 Kapil said that India definitely has a winning potential but it depends on how they execute their plans during the tournament
 kapil ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki team acchhee dikh rahi he
 The Indian team has been playing well for the last five years but it depends on how they perform on match day
 hame nishchit rup se jeet darj karne kii kaabiliyat he
 But how they keep themselves free from pressure and pressure on the rival team will be important
 ’yah poochne par koi vishesh gendbaaj bhartiya team ke liye mahatvapurn sabit ho saktaa he to unhone kaha, ‘yah sirf ek gendbaaj kii baat nahin he kyonki team jitati he
 One can take the lead in bowling but without the team all have to perform in unison only then the team will have a chance to win
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki aaj ke yuva khilaadiyon main shaayad hamase zyada junun he,ham aparipakk the lekin aaj ke yuva peshewar hai
 The Indian selectors have preferred the experience over the younger players who have done well in the IPL
 team ke chayan ke bare main poochne par kapil ne kaha, ‘agar unhone yuva team chuni hoti to aap kehete ki unhone senior khilaadiyon kii andekhi kii he
 Therefore, it is not right to criticize the selectors
 unhone acha kaam kiya he
 My opinion may be different but it is not my job to criticize them
 ’bharat ke paas abhi tak unki tarah kaa gendbaaji aal rounder nahin he or yah poochne par ki kya desh se koi doosraa kapil dev nikalegaa to unhone kaha, ‘yah asambhav he
 i wish that 100 Kapil Dev better than me leave India
 ’unhone kaha, ‘lekin yah ek tej gendbaaj aal rounder nikalne kii baat nahin he
 If you look at r Ashwin or Ravindra Jadeja, he has become a good all rounder for India
 isaliye mujhe lagata he ki hamaari team main kaaphi aal rounder maujuud hai’
 Kapil said, 'I think the team looks good
 bhartiya team pichley paanch varshon se acha khel rahi he lekin yah isi par nirbhar karata he ki ve match ke din kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 We definitely have the ability to win
 lekin ve khud ko kaise dabaav mukt banaaye rakhte hai or pratidwandvi team par dabaav banaate hai,yahi ahm hoga
 "when asked if a particular bowler can prove important to the Indian team, he said," It is not just a matter of a bowler because the team wins
 koi gendbaaji main aguwai kar saktaa he lekin bagaiyr team sabhi ko ekajute hokar pradarshan karnaa hoga tabhi team ke paas jeetne kaa mauka hoga
 "he said," i think that today's young players probably have more passion than us, we were immature but today's youth are professionals
 ’bhartiya chayankartaaon ne yuva khilaadiyon ke bajaay anubhav ko tavajjo di he jinhone ipel main acha pradarshan kiya he
 Asked about the selection of the team, Kapil said, 'if they had chosen the young team, you would have said that they have ignored the senior players
 isaliye chayankartaaon kii aalochana karnaa sahi nahin samajhataa
 They have done a good job
 meri raay bhale hi alag ho sakati he lekin unki aalochana karnaa meraa kaam nahin he
 "india does not yet have a bowling all rounder of their kind and when asked if any other Kapil Dev will come out of the country, he said," It is impossible
 mai kaamana karata hum ki mere se zyada behatar100kapil dev bharat se nikalen
 "he said," But it is not a matter of being a fast bowler all rounder
 agar aap aar aswin yaa ravindra jadeja ko dekho to ve bharat ke liye achche aal rounder bane hai
 That is why i think there are a lot of all-rounders in our team

How did the descendants of Dinkar remain silent?" Arrangements are made in the name of the system and then the public is made in the name of the system

We said, fight with the enemy and the war is politics, you too said it with love, pick it up, speak openly, say it is Rajmukt on Lois, whatever you want, Lois wet flame How would we keep silent when the descendants of Dinkar kept quiet?

 s asked to openly speak, but he was asked to bear everything citing crowns
