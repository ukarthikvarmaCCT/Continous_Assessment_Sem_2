 bindaas actor arjuna kapur apni nai film panipat main apane abhinay ko lekar charchaa main hai
 He played the role of Sadashiv Rao Bhau in this film
 arjuna kii tulana ranvir singh se kii ja rahi he
 Actually Ranveer Singh has played the historical character of the film Bajirao Mastani Bajirao
 ranvir se apni tulana par arjuna kaa kehete hai, 'yah galat he
 i should not be compared to Ranveer
 isaki vajah he ki sadashiv raav or bajirao donon ke vyaktitv main antar he
 These two are warriors of the Maratha army
 lekin sadashiv raav jahaan ek sthir kairactor he vahiin bajirao uske vipareet charitra he
 'are these two characters based on the thinking and understanding of the two directors? To this, Arjun clarifies, 'ashutosh Gowariker and Sanjay Leela Bhansali are experts in their art
 bhansaali ne bajirao mastaani acchhee film banaai thi or bajirao kaa aakarshak kairactor pesh kiya tha
 Ranveer also played that character well
 lekin ashutosh itihaas ke jaankaar hai or unhone jodha akbar jaisi film banaai thi
 He has also done a lot of research for Panipat
 unhone sadashiv raav ke kairactor par kaaphi mehnat kii he
 Not everything is written in the pages of history
 isliye jab aap sadashiv raav dekhenge use dekhakar aap bajirao se tulana nahin kar paaenge
 Ashutosh's film is the story of the third war of Panipat in Panipat
 bakaul arjuna, 'is film main jo khaas he wo isaki kahani he jise itihaas ke pannon main puri tarah se darshaya nahin gaya he
 What we read in the books tells about the end
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki yah ek period film se zyada deshbhakti film he
 This is the story of those who formed a joint army for the first time in India to fight the outsiders
 kyonki isse pehle tak akramanakari aate rahete the, hindustan se chijen le jate rahete the
 But for the first time people united for the country
 yah pehla yuddh tha united india kaa
 i think it is very important to tell this story
 ' arjuna is film ko lekar behad utsahit hai
 They believe that it is necessary to tell those untouched aspects of history today
 kyonki itihaas hamen sab kuch nahin bataata he
 As a filmmaker, Ashutosh has done more work than any historian and should not only like his work but also add it to the pages of history
 is film main sadashiv raav ke kairactor ko sajiv karne ke liye arjuna ne apane sar mudwa liye
 He says, 'if the head is not twisted, i do not feel the real Peshwa
 sadashiv yoddha tha lekin vah ek shant prakruti kaa insaan tha
 In the books, he is described as a stubborn warrior
 magar wo adiyal kyon tha?wo sabaki sunata tha par karata apni tha
 Why was his stream of thinking like this? He was working for United India
 jis tarah se unka ant hua, kaash ye ant nahin hota
 Ashutosh has created this character in his film
 ' arjuna yah bhi kehete hai ki is film ke liye ashutosh ne apni najaron se itihaas ko dekha he
 Arjun further states that when Ashutosh came to him with the proposal of this film, he was himself surprised that what he saw in him
 sadashiv raav kaa photo dekhakar arjuna dwaara prastaav sweekaar karne ke baad ashutosh ne unki sari filmein dobaaraa dekhi
 Ashutosh was not ready to take his look test
 baad main apni jid par arjuna ne luk test diya or yah mana ki wo sach main sadashiv raav dikh rahe hai
 Arjun says that in the film, Sadashiv Rao is not shown screaming like Bajirao while speaking dialogues
 yah donon ke charitra main fark he
 Because Sadasiva interacts normally among his people
 ashutosh ke saath ek aitihaasik film main arjuna ne pehali baar kaam kiya he
 About him, he says that Ashutosh is an Institution of Cinema and his dream of working with a good director has also been fulfilled
 film main sanjay dutt ne ahamed shah abdali kii bhoomika kii he
 When Arjun came to know about this, he went to meet him at his house
 iske baad set par apane senior actor sanjay dutt ke saamne arjuna ko nervas hone kaa mauka nahin mila
 There has been a lot of ups and downs in Arjun's life
 filmi kariyar main bhi unhone safalataa or asafalataa kaa swaad chakhaa he
 With his sour sweet experience, he has tried to balance life and career
 wo kehete hai ki vahi actor lambey res kaa ghoda hota he jo girakar uthe or aage bade
 Everyone loves this moving actor
 arjuna apni asafal filmon ko peeche chhodkar aage badhate hai
 He says, "if you are in the sorrow of failure, then the pace of life will stop
 sakaaratmak soch rakhni chahie
 I'm not into the number game
 mujhe acchhee filmein kerani he or mujhe acchhee filmein mil rahi he
 i am working on a remake of a South film, whose rights were taken by my father
 abhi script par kaam chal rahaa he
 'during the conversation, Arjun also gets emotional and says,' Everything is there in my life
 lekin kahin na kahin ek adhuuraapan bhi he, meri madar nahin hai, jinase main sab kuch kahata tha

 jab ranchi ko local bhashaa main dab kiya to kaaphi logon ne coment karke bataaya ki acha kar rahe ho

 dashahara par ravan dahan kii rasm hoti he
 Which is considered a symbol of the victory of good over evil
 lekin jab tak duniya ke chaar rawanon kaa dahan nahin ho jaataa shanti mumkin nahin he
 By the way, Ravan is full around the world
 lekin ye wo chaar ravan hai jinhone pichley bees-tees saalon main hindustan ko sabase zyada jakhm die or khun ke aansu rulaae
 The world's largest Ravan who crushes goodness with his evilness every day
 jo har pal bas insaaniyat kii maut bun rahe hai
 As long as these alive Ravanas do not end, good will not triumph over evil in the true sense
 jinaravanone hamen sabase zyada jakhm die hai
 Who have been constantly lamenting our country
 jo har vakt bas hindustan main khun-kharabe kii sajeesh hi bunate rahete hai
 They are sitting in the lap of Pakistan, our neighbor
 pakistan main jinda baithe chaar ravanahafiz said, moulana masood ajahar, saiyad salauddin, daaud ibrahim bas in chaar chehron ko dekh lijie
 Then remember all the cities of India that have been injured and bled in the last twenty-five years
 goliyon or bamon se laraje logon ke bare main sochie to inhen ke chehre aapaki ankhon main tairne lagenge
 Even today, their nefarious eyes arise towards our country, so our cities are targeted at them
 kyonki yeravanabakhubi samajhate hai ki agar kisi ke mustakabil ko syah karnaa he to uske khwaabon par hamalaa karo
 Priyam Ravanaj, sitting on the lap of Pakistan, has a reward of more than one million dollars on her head
 use phir bhi pakistan ne apni god main bitha rakhaa he
 The purpose of this Ravana is to cause bloodshed in India
 hindustan ko sabase zyada agar kisi ne khun ke aansu rulaae hai to wo yahi he
 The extent is that even America has placed a bounty of millions of dollars on its head
 lekin phir bhi yeravanpakistan main khulaa gum rahaa he
 The ten million dollar prize trying to set fire to Kashmir by wearing a Kashmiri cap is perhaps the only terrorist in the world who roams freely

 Hafiz Saeed is the biggest Ravan, the biggest of the Mumbai attack is seen from Hafiz Saeed Qaid, the biggest of these four Ravans is Ravana
 kyonki jitne jakhm isane hindustan ko die hai utane kisi ne nahin die
 Although he was born in this country before partition
 haryana ke rahane vaale hafiz said ke parivaar ke kuch log bantwaare ke dauraan dangon main maare gaye the
 After that he went to Pakistan
 bas tabhi se wo har vakt hindustan kii barbaadi kii sajishein bunata rahata he
 The Pakistani army received Hafiz's support
 Hafiz Saeed's name was first heard by the world when he laid the foundation of terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba in 1990 with the help of Pakistan intelligence agency ISI
 iske baad hafiz said ke ishaare par lashkar ne jammu-kashmir samet hindustan ke kai ilaakon main ek ke baad angintantakavaadi hamalonko anjaam diya
 In which hundreds of people died
 darasal hafiz said ne aatank kii apni dukaan kii shuruyaat kashmir ke naam par kii thi
 His motive behind doing this was to infiltrate fundamentalist forces in Pakistan's army and gain the sympathy of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI
 is makasad main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab bhi rahaa
 a large part of the Pakistani army consists of Hafiz Saeed's supporters
 yahi vajah he kisanyukt raashtra tak se aatankwaadi ghoshit qaraar die jane ke baad bhi pakistan main uske khilaaf kabhi koi karrwai nahin hui
 Because the Pak army has its support
 hafiz ne bharat ko die jakhmakashmir or chote-mote tamaam hamalon ko chhod den to hafiz said ne bharat ko sabase bada jakhm 2006 or 2011 main diya tha
 Hafiz Saeed was the brain behind the Mumbai serial train blasts on 11 July 2006 and the 26 / 11 Mumbai attacks
 yahaan tak ki in hamalon ke silsile main uske khilaaf tamaam pukhta saboot bhi pakistan ko die gaye
 But the Pakistani court acquitted Hafiz Saeed because of the Pakistan Army and the ISI having their hands on the head
 sargical strike main maare gaye hafiz ke gurgeuri hamale ke jawaab main baariya sena ne elosi main ghus karsargical oparationakia

 khabar he ki bhartiya sena ke sargical oparation ke baad hafiz said ko paak sena or iesai ne aagaah kiya he ki wo apni movement kam kar den

 The environment ministry strongly recommended the demolition of the 31-storey building of the controversial Adarsh residential Society located in the Colaba area of mumbai as unauthorized and said that ignoring the law cannot be an excuse for not following it
 paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ke dastakhat vaale is aadesh main kaha gaya, puure dhaanche ko hataa diya jaae, kyonki yah anaadhikrut he or iske nirmaan ke liye tateey niyaman kshetra (siarjed) adhisuchana 1999 ke tahat koi manjuuri hasil nahin kii gai he
 The ministry strictly stated in its order that the unauthorized structure be dropped and that area be brought back to its original position within three months
 kolaba sthit is imaarat ke liye mul rup se chah manjilon kaa nirmaan hona tha or isamen kargil yuddh ke shaheedon ke parijanon ko awaas die jane the
 The environment ministry said in its report that 31 floors were built without obtaining the necessary approval
 paryaavaran mantralay ne adarsh sosayadi ko uski 31 manjila imaarat ke nirmaan ke bare main pichley varsh 12 november ko ek kaaran bataao notice jari karte hue kaha tha ki kyon na uski avaidh manjilon ko gira diya jaae
 However, Ramesh said in a two-pronged final order of the environment ministry that apart from demolishing the building, two other options were also considered
 ek vikalp yah tha ki agar upyukt praadhikaar se jaruri manjuuri lee gayi hoti to imaarat kii atirikt manjilon ko hataane ko kaha ja saktaa tha
 Ramesh said the option to demolish some floors was rejected because suggesting doing so would have been like regularizing or waiving a very serious violation of the CRZ notification
 paryaavaran mantralay kii report kahati he ki is ek or vikalp par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ki sarkaar ko is imaarat kaa niyantran lene kii sifarish kii jaae, taaki baad main imaarat kaa kisi saarvajanik uddeshy ke liye istemaal karne ke bare main vichaar kiya ja sake
 Ramesh said that this option was also considered, but it was also rejected, because even though the final use would have been in the public interest, it would have made regularization of the CRZ Notification 1999 violation
 unhone kaha, is maamle main (imaarat ko gira dene kii sifarish ke itar) koi anya faisla karnaa supreme court or vibhinn hoicorton dwaara unke nirnyon main sthapit kiye gaye kade purv udaahranon ke mukaable narmi baratane jaisaa hota
 The Adarsh residential Society has violated the original spirit of the CRZ notification, the ministry report says
 sosayadi ne is adhisuchana ke tahat manjilon ke nirmaan ke liye manjuuri lene kii jarurat ko bhi nahin pahachaanaa
 Whether or not the Society was aware of such a need, it does not matter, because the law is ignored, there can be no excuse for not complying with it
 mantralay ne adarsh sosayadi ko die apane nirdesh main saaf taur par kaha ki 31 manjila imaarat ko gira diya jaae or us kshetra ko teen maheene ke bheetar uski mul sthiti main laa diya jaae
 The ministry said that in case the building is not demolished, it will be forced to take steps to enforce its directives legally
 ramesh ne is report ke jariye yah bhi spasht kiya ki 7 janvari se amal main ai nai siarjed adhisuchana 2011 se adarsh awasaiya sosayadi jaise maamalon par koi asar nahin padegaa or aise maamalon se purv kii adhisuchana ke anuroop hi nipta jayega
 In a meeting of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority held on 11 November, there was a consideration of the alleged violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification by the Adarsh residential Society
 is baithak ke agle hi din 12 november ko mantralay ne sosayadi ko kaaran bataao notice jari kar diya
 After this the Society was given time to file the reply and it was further extended for a time

 robert wadra ne mangalvaar ko dilli ucch nyaayalay se mani londring maamle main unki agrim jamaanat ko chunauti dene vaali pravartan nideshaalay (idi) kii yachika par jawaab daayar karne ke liye samay maanga he
 Justice Chandrashekhar gave Vadra two weeks to file an answer to the plea challenging his anticipatory bail and fixed the matter for September 26 for further hearing
 wadra ke vakil ne kaha ki vah us samay bharat se baahar the jab yachika par adaalat kaa notice unhen mila or vah 11 july ko laute hai
 Vadra is accused of money laundering in London's '12 Bryanston Square 'for buying property worth 1
9 million pounds
 maamle kii jaanch dhanshodhan rokthaam adhinium ke tahat kii ja rahi he
 Let me tell you that earlier in March this year, he was questioned by ED in Delhi office
 darasal idi ne kaha tha ki hamen robert wadra ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kerani he
 We have enough evidence against Robert Vadra
 wadra saboot mitaa sakate hai
 The ED had said that Vadra has a case of serious economic offenses
 ise halke main nahin lenaa chahie
 If there is a very big man, it does not mean that he will escape the investigation
 wadra kii agrim jamaanat khaarij ho
 The court reserved the verdict on Vadra's anticipatory bail till April 1
 (input-bhashaa) In the aarushi-hemraj murder case, the court directed the CBI to provide the necessary documents to the Talwar couple
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee ke liye 14 may kii taarikh mukarrar kii gai he
 During the hearing in the CBI court of Ghaziabad, the CBI said that it is ready to give the documents to the Talwar couple
 sibiai ne kol detail se sambandhit kagajaat talwaar danpati ko dene se inkaar kiya
 The special CBI court reserved its order till 14 May on the plea of nupur and Rajesh Talwar, the main accused in the Aarushi and Hemraj murder case, that all the CBI documents related to the case have not been provided to them
 atirikt jila or satr nyaayadhish shyaam laal kii adaalat, jise sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke taur par praadhikrut kiya gaya he, ne talwaar kii yachika par apana aupchaarik faisla 14 may tak ke liye surakshit rakhaa, kyonki maamle ko satr adaalat ko bheje jane ke baad pehle hi din talwaar danpati ke vakil ne shikaayat kii thi ki unhen maamle se jude sibiai ke tamaam dastavej muhaiyaa nahin karaae gaye hai
 Responding to the Talwar couple's plea, CBI counsel RK Saini told the court that the agency had provided all relevant documents to those people and had only withheld documents which had no justification for their prosecution
 nyaayadhish ne pehle sibiai se maukhik rup se kaha ki ‘nyaay ke hit main’ main tamaam dastavej talwaar danpati ko den
 Since the Talwar couple had formally applied to the court to obtain the documents, the next hearing of the case was set for May 14 to pronounce a formal order on them
 apni yachika main talwaar dampati ne kaha tha ki sibiai ne maamle se jude sabhi dastavej unhen muhaiyaa nahin karaae hai
 These include the report prepared by the first investigating officer of Uttar Pradesh Police, Datram Nauneria and the record of his telephone calls
 sibiai ne haalanki iskaa joardaar virodh kiya
 Special judicial magistrate Preeti Singh had earlier referred the matter to the sessions court on May 9
 unhone talwaar dampati kii is daleel ko thukraa diya ki is maamle par abhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa kyonki unhen abhiyojan sambandhi tamaam dastavej nahin die gaye hai
 Aarushi was assassinated on the intervening night of 16-17 May 2008 at her Noida residence
 ghar ke naukar hemraj kaa shav bhi agle din makaan kii chat se baraamad kiya gaya tha
 The Aarushi massacre, which has been a puzzle for the whole of India for the last 4 years, is reaching a new turning point
 aarushi hatyakand par ghaziabad seshan court main trial shuru ho gaya
 CBI suspects Talwar couple in the killing of Aarushi and Hemraj
 aarushi-hemraj hatyakand main talwaar danpati par sibiai ke shaq karne kii ek-do nahin, balki kai vajahen hai
 The key to Aarushi's room was lying in the lobby, while the Talwar couple always kept it with them
 vaardaat ke baad jagah-jagah khun ke nishaanon ko poncha gaya tha
 After Aarushi's murder, the Talwar couple sent the police out in search of Hemraj
 itnaa hi nahin, khun ke nishaan milane par bhi talwaar danpati ne police ko chat kii chaabi nahin di
 Rajesh Talwar refused to identify Hemraj's corpse found on the roof
 aarushi kii postmortem report main herpher karne ke liye dabaav bhi banaaya gaya
 Even after getting the missing golf stick after the murder, the Talwar couple polished it
 aarushi or hemraj kaa galaa khaas sargical blade se kaata gaya, jise doctor istemaal karte hai
 The Scotch bottle placed on the dining table had blood marks of Aarushi and Hemraj
 doctor talwaar ne internet ko subah 3 bajkar 43 minute par band kiya, jabaki aarushi kaa katl raat 12 se ek ke bich hua
 There was a wooden wall between the Talwar couple and Aarushi's room, yet Aarushi's scream was not heard
 16 may, 2008 ko hue aarushi-hemraj hatyakand kii kadiyaan kahin na kahin talwaar danpati se judati hai, lekin sibiai bhi maanati he ki dohare hatyakand main talwaar danpati ke khilaaf pukhta saboot nahin hai
 In such a situation, now everyone's eyes are on the court
 madhya pradesh ke khandwa jile ke adivasee bahul kshetra khalwa kaa langoti gaanv duusare gaanvon se zyada alag nahin he
 But the story of a well made here has made this village different from any village in the country
 pani kii samasya se trast gaanv kii 20 mahilaon ne chattaanon ko 25 foot tak gaharaa khod daalaa or dharti kaa seenaa cheer pani nikaal dikhaaya he
 Says 25-year-old Mishribai, forcing her to explode continuously on the hard rocks, saying, “the men of the village used to make us laugh
 kehete the, kuan khodna auraton ke bas kii baat nahin he
 We have responded to them with our work
 hamen khud par bhi bharosa ho gaya ki ab hamen kisi bhi kaam ke liye kisi ke aage gidgidaane kii jarurat nahin he
 “the village of Langoti has a population of over 2,000, while the sources of water are extremely limited
 pani kii saal-dar-saal gaharaati ja rahi samasya ko hal karne ke liye gaanv kii mahilaon ne panchayat se lekar prashasan tak, sab taraf guhaar lagaai lekin mili to keval aashwaasan
 It was becoming difficult for him to bring water from two to two and a half kilometers away everyday
 sarpanchapati ke seetaram patel kehete hai, “kuch handpump band hai to kuch kuon kaa pani pradooshit he
 Water source also remains in summer
 ” is par mahilaon ne apane hi parivaar ke purushon se kuan khodne ko kaha
 But they too were not willing to work for free
 phir kya tha! mahilaon ne khud hi kuan khodne kii thaan lee
 Now the problem was that where the well dug and where to get the land from
 iske liye bhi ek mahila 60 varshiya ramakalibai hi aage ain
 He donated his land for this noble cause
 is jameen par pani kis jagah ho saktaa he, iskaa andaja gaanv ke ek bujurg ne apane anubhav ke aadhaar par lagaaya
 In April 2012, women started digging just two years ago at the same site
 din-raat is kaam main juty in mahilaon ne ek maah ke bheetar hi kareeb 12 foot tak khod daalaa
 But the challenge for these impudent women was not over yet
 khodate-khodate ek din unki kudaliyaan kathor chattaanon se takaraa gayi
 Seeing this, once again, he got emboldened
 ek aashaa thi ki unhen is tarah mehnat karata dekh panchayat pasijegi or aage kaa kaam puraa karne kii jimmedaari khud uthaa legi
 But she did not get any help from the lady sarpanch Khanaibai
 gaanv ke seetaram bataate hai, “haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan is kshetra ke vidhayak or pradesh ke cabinet mantri vijay shah yahaan naljal yojana kii ghoshnaa kar gaye the
 But women who have been deceived from all sides, it is better to complete this work on their own rather than trusting anyone
 ”31 janvari, 2014 ko phir se gaanv kii 20 mahilaon ne kudaal, sabbal, chheni, hathaudaa or tagariyaan lekar kuen par morcha sambhaal liya
 After handling all the household chores, Phulwati, 26, used to go to the well every morning at 9 am with tools and food
 yahaan 20 varsh kii yuvatiyon se lekar 70 varsh kii mahilaayein bhi bina thake subah 9 se shaam 5 baje tak duty puri karti hai
 In less than a month, these women made the well 25 feet deep
 mahilaon kii dilari dekh chattaane bhi shaayad pasij gayi
 On 7 February, a stream of water came out of this well
 mishribai kahati hai, “ab hamen kisi ke sahyog kii jarurat nahin he
 We have done so much work ourselves, we will do the rest
 ab koi purush aage aakar madad kii peshkash bhi karata he to ham saaf manaa kar dete hai
 “the discussions of the women of the village are reaching far and wide
 lekin inkaa hausala badhaane koi janpratinidhi yaa adhikari khalwa nahin pahunchaa he

 a tourist bus accident was reported on Saturday afternoon, carrying more than 50 passengers
 news agency shinhua ke mutabik, santa katrina praant main ek ghumaavdaar raste par bas ke driver ne niyantran kho gaya or bas sadak se utarkar khai main ja giri
 As soon as the accident was reported, a lodge ambulance was sent to the scene, but due to the darkness in the evening, rescue operations were hampered
 -input IANS se The wide spread of air that surrounds the Earth is called the Earth atmosphere
 vayumandal kii upree parat ke adhyayan ko vayuvigyaan (aerology) or nichali parat ke adhyayan ko ritu vigyaan (meterology) kehete hai
 According to the volume, there is a mixture of different gases in the atmosphere within 30 miles which are as follows- Nitrogen 78
 07 fisadi, oxijan 20
 93 percent, carbon dioxide
 03 fisadi or argon 
 93 percent
 vayumandal main pai jane vaali kuch mahatvapurn gas1
 Nitrogen: The percentage amount of this gas is more than all gases
 nitrogen kii upasthiti ke kaaran hi vayudab, pawanon kii shakti or prakaash ke paravartan kaa abhas hota he
 This gas has no color, smell or taste
 nitrogen kaa sabase bada laabh yah he ki yah vastuon ko teji se jalane se bachaati he
 If there was no nitrogen in the atmosphere it would have been difficult to control the fire
 nitrogen se ped-paudhon main proteinon kaa nirmaan hota he, jo bhojan kaa mukhya kaa ang he
 This gas extends up to 128 kilometers in the atmosphere
 2
 Oxygen - It works with other substances to burn
 oxijan ke abhaav main ham idhan nahin jala sakate
 It is the main source of energy
 yah gas vayumandal main 64 kilometre kii oonchai tak faili hui he, par 16 kilometre se upar jaakar isaki maatra bahut kam ho jaati he
 3
 carbon-daai-oxide-yah sabase baari gas he or is kaaran yah sabase nichali parat main milti he phir bhi iskaa vistaar 32 kimi kii oonchai tak he
 This gas is permeable to radiation coming from the Sun and inaccessible to radiation reflected from the Earth
 4
 Ozone - This gas is a special form of oxygen
 yah vayumandal main adhik oonchaaiyon par hi ati nune maatra main milti he
 It absorbs a fraction of the ultraviolet radiation coming from the Sun
 yah 10 se 50 kimi kii oonchai tak kendrit he
 a decrease in the amount of ozone gas in the atmosphere can cause the sun's ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth in greater quantities and spread terrible diseases such as cancer
 (a)gaison ke atirikt vayumandal main jalawaashp or dhul ke kan bhi upasthit hai
 (b) The color of the sky is visible due to blue dust particles
 (c)jalawaashp surya se aane vaale surya tap ke kuch bhaag ko avashoshit kar letaa he or prithvi dwaara vikarit ooshmaa ko sanjoe rakhata he
 Thus it acts as a blanket
 isse prithvi naa to adhik garm or naa hi atyadhik thandi ho sakati he
 (d) Water vapor is the most variable and unevenly distributed gas in the atmosphere

 The displaced people of the Sardar Sarovar Dam Project have received a major relief from the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne sardaar sarovar baandh project ko lekar buudhvaar ko aham sunwaayee kii
 The court has ordered compensation of 681 displaced families at 60 lakhs per 2 hectare
 sarkaar pehle 5
 58 was paying compensation per 2 hectares
 narmada ghati vikaas praadhikaran (NVDA) visthapit pariwaron ke muaavje ke paise greevans redresal athurity ko degaa
 Within 2 months, the Grevens Redressal Authority will pay the money to displaced families
 court ke aadesh ke anusaar 31 july tak visthapit pariwaron ko project kii jameen ko chhodana hoga (jo hissaa jalmagn ho jaayegaa)
 1358 displaced other families will get compensation of Rs 15 lakh per family
 un 1358 visthapit pariwaron ko jo pehle muaavja mil chukaa he wo 15 lakh rupee main se gata diya jayega
 In this way, the court disposed of all pending cases
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne kaha tha ki kanoonee masale se koi hal nahin nikalegaa
 This will neither benefit those people whose land has gone nor the government
 yahaan tak ki sardaar sarovar baandh kii oonchai kaa kaam puraa ho chukaa he lekin uskaa asar nahin dikh rahaa
 It would be better if the state government and Narmada Bachao Andolan come to court with a plan and practical solution
 tippaniyan The court had said that suggest a name for a committee to decide the compensation at the current rate
 darasal supreme court narmada bachaao andolan kii yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he jisamen baandh ke liye jamine kho dene vaale logon ke liye raahat or punarvaas ke aadesh dene kii maang kii gai he
 Chief Justice JS Khehar said that litigation like this will do nothing
 iske liye practical samaadhaan khojane kii zarurat he
 However, it was said by the state government that many people are not ready to take land
 lekin court ne kaha ki sarkaar logon ko banjar jameen nahin de sakati
 Either the government should arrange for double compensation to the people
 darasal sardaar sarovar baandh kii oonchai badhaane ke kaam main gujarat, maharashtra or madhyapradesh ke kareeb 45 hajaar logon kii jameen lee gai he
 a hearing on rehabilitation is going on in the Supreme Court about this
 1358 visthapit duusare pariwaron ko 15 lakh rupee ke hisaab se prati parivaar muaavja milegaa
 Those 1358 displaced families who have received compensation earlier will be reduced from Rs 15 lakh
 is tarah court ne sabhi lambit maamalon kaa nistaaran kar diya
 In the last hearing, the court said that no solution will be found to the legal issue
 isse naa to un logon kaa phayda hoga jinaki jameen chali gai he or naa hi sarkaar ko
 Even the height work of Sardar Sarovar Dam has been completed but its effect is not visible
 behatar ye hoga ki rajya sarkaar or narmada bachaao andolan koi yojana or practical samaadhaan lekar court aaen
 The comments court ne kaha tha ki ek cameti ke liye naam sujhaayen jo vartmaan dar se muaavja tay kare
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a petition of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, which has sought an order for relief and rehabilitation for those who have lost land for the dam
 mukhya nyaayadhish jees khehar ne kaha ki is tarah mukademebaaji se kuch nahin hoga
 There is a need to find practical solutions for this
 haalanki rajya sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki kaaphi log jameen lene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 But the court said that the government cannot give barren land to the people
 yaa to sarkaar logon ko dugana muaavja dene kii vyavastha kare
 Actually, in the work of increasing the height of Sardar Sarovar Dam, land of about 45 thousand people of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh has been taken
 isi ko lekar supreme court main punarvaas ko lekar sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The court had said that suggest a name for a committee to decide the compensation at the current rate

 The uproar arose after Manohar Lal Panth alias Mannu Kori, the Minister of State for Labor of Uttar Pradesh Government and MLA from Mehroni, wrote a letter to the Health Minister
 darasal shram mantri ne berozegaar bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko sanvidakarmi ke taur par sarkari vibhaagon main niyukt karne ko lekar sawasthya mantri ko patr likhaa he
 The Samajwadi Party has started protesting on this letter of the Minister before the contractual workers appointed in the Health Department express their protest
 sapa kaa aarope he ki sanvida karmiyon kii niyukti paatrata or kaabiliyat ke aadhaar par hoti he na ki kisi party ke kaaryakarta ke thappe ke baad
 The minister has broken the constitutional decree by writing such a letter, so the government should act on them
 darasal lalitpur jile kii maharauni vidhansabha se chunaav jitkar vidhansabha pahunche manohar laal panth urf mannu kori sarkaar main shram rajyamantri kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai
 He often makes headlines about his statements, but this time there is no statement in the headlines but a letter written by him to the state health minister
 yah patr unke hi offis ke kisi karmchaaree ne viral kar unki pareshaani ko badha diya he
 In a letter written to the Health Minister, the Labor Minister is demanding the removal of contract workers appointed in Lalitpur district
 saath hi likhte hai ki sanvida karmi sapa maansikta ke hone ke kaaran thik dhang se kaary sampadit nahin kar rahe hai, isliye inhen hataakar bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon kii niyukti kii jaae
 Now Samajwadi Party has created a ruckus regarding this letter
 lakhanu se lekar lalitpur tak raajnneeti garam ho gai he
 After this letter, Samajwadi Party leaders are beginning to put the BJP government's intentions in the dock, in which there is a plan to place BJP workers in departmental posts in an unconstitutional manner
 samaajawaadee party ke purv rashtriya koshadhyaksh or rajyasabha saansad chandrapal singh yadav shram mantri manohar laal panth par karrwai kii maang karte hue kehete hai, shram mantri ne samvidhan kii shapath kii maryaada todi he
 What does he want to prove by writing such a letter after being in such a big position
 kya yah sarkaar sirf bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke liye he
 Not for the common man
 unka yah kahana ki ye duusari party ke log naukari paae the or ab hamaari party ke log naukari karenge, jabaki party ke log naukari thodi karte hai
 The contract officers are appointed on the basis of administrative officer competence
 to kya ab bhaajapa sarkaar is adhikaar ko apane mantri yaa netaaon ko dene ja rahi he
 According to Chandrapal Singh, till now administrative officials had the responsibility of appointing them by looking at their merit and ability, but this is the first time that ministers and leaders have started giving direct guidelines in their appointment
 vahiin samaajawaadee party ke pradesh adhyaksh naresh uttam ne to lakhanu main isko lekar pradarshan kiya
 Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Ahmed Hassan, along with the state president, has even demanded the dismissal of Labor and Employment Minister Manohar Lal Panth from the Yogi government
 unhone kaha, jo patr likhaa gaya vah behad sharmnaak he or pratibhavan yuvaaon ko partiyon kii rang main baantne kaa prayaas he
 What is written in the letter? Value

 The contract workers who work here do Netagiri every day and do not do the work properly
 atev aise sanvida karmchaariyon ko hataakar suyogy karmchaaree rakhana chahie, jisase aam janata ko sahi dhang se laabh mil sake
 The contractor is not paying PF, PSI
 nai vyavastha ke tahat nae carmikon kii niyukti nahin kii ja rahi he
 In this regard, the appointment of qualified and hard-working new workers is required as per the rules
 bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko naukari dene kii bhi likhi batanshram mantri ne swasthya mantri ko likhe patr ke aakhri para main anurodh ke saath likhaa he ki, sapa sarkaar main niyukt carmikon ko hataate hue bijepi party ke suyogy evam karmath kaaryakartaaon ko sanvida par niyukti pradaan karaane kaa ksht karen, jisase party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal badhaayaa ja sake
 Health officer rejected the minister's point: Dr
 Lalitpur Chief Medical Superintendent
 sanjay baswani ne shram mantri kii us baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki aspataal bhraman ke dauraan sanvida karmiyon ke kisi party vishesh kaa samarthak hone or kaam nahin karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 Dr
 baswani kehete hai, unke yahaan jo sanvida karmi kaary kar rahe hai un par kisi bhi raajnneetik gatividhi main lipt hone kaa aarope nahin he
 He is satisfied with his work
 jabaki shram mantri apane patr main likhi baton par ab bhi kaayam hai
 Panth says, he has informed the health minister about the situation here only on the feedback of the health officials of the district
 hamane apana paksh swasthya mantri ke saamne rakhaa he
 Now they have to decide on this
 jabaki, mantri ke bayaan ke baad sanvidakarmiyon ne abhi tak apana munh sil rakhaa he

 - Input IANS safed baagh, vaigyanikon ke liye to bengal tiger kii saamaanya prajati main hue maamuli genetic muteshan se zyada kuch nahin he, lekin madhya pradesh ke vindhyas kshetra ke liye vah apni bagheli shahi thasak kaa ek purana muhaavara he
 Only when the white tiger safari was inaugurated at Mukundpur village in Satna district on April 3, the atmosphere was passionate and passionate like the election process
 taaja daale gaye koltar par, apni chappalein chipki chhod aae gaanvvaalon ko is baat kii tasalli thi ki jis safed baagh ko 1951 main raja martand singh ne apane mahendragarh kile main paalkar duniya ko safed baagh se rou-ba-rou karaayaa tha, aakhir uske vanshaj—kahawaton se nikalakar phir ilaake main laut aae
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, sitting on the platform, his right hand in Rewa, local MLA and Madhya Pradesh cabinet minister Rajendra Shukla, Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Prakash Javadekar were comforted that the tiger roar in their stronghold, the Congress walls Will move
 baagh safari ke is rajnatik sanket ko samajhnaa ho to pichley vidhansabha chunaav ko jehan main laana hoga
 In spite of a landslide victory for the BJP in this election, the seven districts of Rewa and Shahdol divisions had a narrow victory
 us samay yahaan kii 28 vidhansabha siton main se bijepi ko 16 or congress ko 12 siten mili thim
 At the same time, two seats went to bsp's account
 lagaataar teesraa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke baavjood bijepi ko kasak thi ki congress ke divangat diggaj netaa arjuna singh or reva ke buudhe 'safed sher' shrinivas tiwari ke kad kii chaaya main camel khulkar nahin khil paa rahaa
 Therefore, Shivraj Singh Chauhan's mission Vindhya has continued continuously since that election
 iskaa ek hissaa congress ke puraane netaa or kaaryakartaaon ko bijepi se jodne kaa he, to doosraa hissaa vindhyas kshetra yaa baghelkhand ke logon ko yah ehsaas karana ki party jitani tavajjo chambal, malwa, mahakaushal, nimad jaise duusare kshetron ko detii he, utani hi unhen bhi di ja rahi he
 Only then, despite Gauri Shankar Shejwar being the Forest Minister, the Chief Minister gave open hand to Shukla, Minister of Departments like Energy, Minerals and Public Relations to make White Tiger Safari, on the other hand by pulling the historic Maihar seat of Satna district from the Congress through a by-election
 He was also made the chief strategist for the BJP
 yah ranneeti un puraane dinon kii yaad dilaati he, jab mukhyamantri rahete hue digvijay singh kaha karte the ki reva ke mukhyamantri to shrinivas tiwari hi hai
 It is the effect of this pair of chauhan-shukla that Narayan Tripathi, who won the assembly elections on a Congress ticket from Maihar in 2013, not only gave up his legislature, but won it again in February this year by contesting on a BJP ticket
 kehane ko jeet choti he, lekin is jeet ne puure ilaake main bijepi ke maahaul kaa behatar kiya he
 The effect of this environment is that Rewa Naresh Pushpraj Singh, who was a three-time Congress MLA from Rewa, was not only present on the inaugural stage of the tiger safari, but was also embroidering in praise of Chauhan and Shukla
 unke putr divyaraj singh reva kii sirmaur seat se bijepi vidhayak hai
 If the raja-maharaja is being brought towards the party, the deprived section is also on the party's radar
 adivaasiyon ko party se jodne ke liye anuppur main shabari mahakumbh, to daliton ko party se jodgaye ke liye sant ravidaas mahakumbh kaa aayojan isi saal kiya gaya
 By adding a large crowd to these programs, Shivraj has changed the traditional politics of the BJP
 aisa nahin he ki congress shivaraj kii is ranneeti se nawakif he
 That is why, a day before the inauguration of the safari, three Congress mlas from Vindhya region Sundarlal Tiwari, Jitu Patwari and Sukhendra Singh Banna moved a motion calling attention to the assembly regarding the safari
 van mantri shejavaar ne safari nirmaan main bhrashtachar kii baat bhi sweekaar kii
 Shejwar also informed about the action taken against the then officials in this case
 lekin congress vidhayak isse sahamat nahin hue or unhone sadan se bahirgaman kiya
 But insisting on keeping this politics aside, Shukla told India Today, "we were always suffering that if other areas of the state get one rupee from Bhopal, then Vindhya gets four visits
 mukhyamantri ji ne pehali baar vindhyas ke liye sava rupye kaa intjaam kiya he
 If you travel by road from the famous Khajuraho of Bundelkhand to Rewa in Baghelkhand, then it is clear that a large number of dry fields are seen in Bundelkhand without sowing, while in Baghelkhand, thresher-sawdust-barned barns are seen
 isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki reva ke chaar lakh hectare ilaake ko bansagar baandh pariyojna se pani milane laga he
 —however, when some farmers protested against not getting the right compensation in this project, Chauhan said to the forum, "I have seen your placards
" jab tak shivaraj jinda he, koi vindhyavaasi pareshaan nahin rah saktaa
 You meet me after the program

 The white tiger safari is a step in the same direction
 '' sthaneey logon ko lubhaane ke liye mukhyamantri ne reva main lo cost airport chaalu karne kii bhi ghoshnaa kar di or reva ko pramukh shaharon se jodne vaale raaston ko behatar banane kii baat kahi
 Before doing all these things on the stage, all the leaders enjoyed the Tiger Safari by sitting in a battery cart

 Modi, who came to know about the well being of children suffering from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur, said that the BJP wants to elect Bihar assembly at the right time
 unhone kaha ki nitish apane vidhayakon ko vidhansabha bhang karwaane kii chetavanee de rahe hai
 Describing the horse trading allegations on BJP for the Rajya Sabha by-election in Bihar as baseless, he said that Nitish Kumar himself has been adopting wrong methods to save the government
 idhar, bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mangal pandeya ne bhi nitish par bihar kii janata ke saath vishwasghaat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki satta ke liye 17 varsho tak bijepi sampradayik party nahin thi
 He said that Nitish is now doing politics of opportunism and is also ashamed of his statements

 ab jald hi dilli main bhi freshli brued bear yani ki taaji bear milegi
 It was being awaited for a long time and after about three years, the Delhi Cabinet approved the proposal of the Excise Department to open micro breweries in the capital
 jaahir taur par is faisle se na keval dilli, balki noida or aasapaas ke ilaakon kebear premiyonmen khushi kii lahar he
 Earlier people had to turn to Gurugram for fresh beer
 gurugram main kareeb kareeb 50 choti badi micro bruaries hai
 On weekends, a large number of youth of the capital and NCR used to reach Gurugram after struggling with long traffic
 ab dilli main bhi micro bruaries khulte hi in logon ko raahat milegi
 After this order, the owners of micro breweries of Gurugram have also welcomed it openly
 unka kahana he ki isse unke bijness par zyada fark nahin padegaa
 Rohit Lohani, brand head of Prankster, Sector-29, Gurugram, says that i am happy that this decision is coming on the new year
 taaji bear kii demand bahut zyada he or supplai utani nahin he
 Therefore, if such pubs are opened in Delhi too, it would be a good move for beerindustry

 The lovers of fresh breary do not experiment

 The Supreme Court has given the BS Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka till 4 pm to prove its majority
 haalanki rajya vidhansabha main jis tarah ke halaat hai, use dekhakar lagata he ki bijepi ke liye apni sarkaar bachaana aasaan nahin hoga
 However, the government claims that it will be able to get a vote of confidence in the House
 lekin abhi takkarnatakavidhansabha chunaav kii sthiti par najar daalen to yah itnaa aasaan nahin lag rahaa
 In the results of 222 seats in the Karnataka Assembly elections, BJP got 104 seats, and this number is 8 less than the majority
 duusari ore, congress ko 78 or jedies ko 37, basapa ko 1 or anya ko 2 siten mili hai
 Kumaraswamy has won 2 seats, so 111 mlas are needed for a majority
 aise membijepiki is nai sarkaar ke liye shanivaar kaa din behad ahm sabit hone ja rahaa he
 It is not that the Yeddyurappa government has no hope of survival
 yahaan bhi agar-magar kii sthiti he
 What is the alternative? BJP needs the support of 111 mlas to save a two-day government
 jedies ke netaa kumaraswami ne 2 siton par jeet hasil kii he, aise main inkaa ek hi vot maanya hoga
 Let us know the options that are possible in which the government can get a majority and Yeddyurappa can continue on the chair
 vikalp 1party line se alag hokar vipaksh ke 7 vidhayak vishwaas prastaav ke samarthan main vot den
 In such a case, the BJP with its 104 and 7 mlas will touch 111 and get a majority
 vikalp 2vipaksh ke 14 vidhayak matdaan ke dauraan gairmaujuud rahen
 Thus, after the 14 mlas in the House having 221 mlas, 207 mlas will be present in the House and for the majority, BJP will need the support of 104 mlas which it already has

 Earlier on Friday, the Delhi High Court refused to stay the release of Juvenile in the Nirbhaya case
 20 disambar ko uski sajaa puri ho rahi he, iske baad vah aaazaad ho jayega
 However, a committee of the Juvenile Justice Board will monitor it for two years
 court ke is faisle par niraashaa jataate huenirbhaya kii maa ne kahaaki kanoon bhagwaan nahin banataa he
 The offender should be punished by changing the law
 chif justise ji
 While hearing the case, Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath said that the convict, who was a minor at the time of the crime, cannot be kept in the correctional home after December 20
 doshi ko reeha na karne ke liye jo bhi tark die gaye wo sab sahi he
 But court hands are bound by law
 kisi naaballig ko bade se bade gunaah kii adhiktam sajaa bhi sirf teen saal hi ho sakati he
 This is the current law
 court ne kaha ki juvenil justise board ek cameti banaae
 This committee will monitor the conviction and his behavior after the release
 is cameti main enjio or saamaajik kaaryakarta bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 On the next hearing of this matter, on March 28, this committee should also submit its report
 adishnal solicytor general sanjay jain ne kaha ki juvenil ko yojanabaddh tareeke se reeha kiya jayega
 'change the law to punish the guilty' Court's hands are bound by the law, to which Nirbhaya's mother said that the law here does not make God
 yadi kanoon ban saktaa he, to use badla bhi ja saktaa he
 In which law it is written that six people together and wrong a girl child
 yadi ve kanoon tod sakate hai, to unhen kanoon badal kar sajaa kyon nahin di ja sakati he
 Our three-year struggle was defeated, crime won
 'jari rahegi nirbhaya ke insaaf kii ladaai'court dwaara juvenil main sudhaar kii gunjaaish par unhone kaha ki hamen or samaaj ko bhramit kiya ja rahaa he
 He was free even three years ago and will be free again
 hamen hoicourt se nyaay kii kuch ummid thi, lekin hamen nyaay nahin mila he
 Our fight will continue
 ham ab supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 Till the convicts are punished, the soul of Nirbhaya will not get peace
 supreme court tak jayega mahila ayogkendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha kii court ne jo kaha he, us par ham sawaal nahin kar sakate hai
 But if the perpetrators of the truth are of any age, if they roam freely, then the result will not be right
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal kaa kahana he ki is maamle main supreme court or raashtrapati tak se apil kii jaaegi ki nirbhaya ke sabase bade gunahagaar ko reeha na kiya jaae

 In this sting operation, we caught some people in khaki uniform talking on camera like khap panchayats

 They do not even care about the law

 ASI Karmaveer of the Asaudi outpost of Bahadurgarh says, "take the boat and slam it into the river
" jane do jahaan chali jaaegi
 
 
 'so Kali Ram, the ASI of Kharawar garrison of Rohtak, says,' i will shoot him and you too- or if there is more problem
 
 Beat him to death ’greater noida ke esai ajay singh to kehete hai ki khap panchayat thik kar rahi he
 Our Investigating team first arrived at the Kharawar police post in Rohtak, making the excuse that our girl Guddi had eloped with a boy of her own gotra
 vahaan hamaari mulaakaat eesai kaali ram se hui
 We explain what ASI Kaliram said
 
 ASI Kaliram- We will hand over the girl to you and threaten the boy to make a case against you
 lekin hamane eesai kaali ram se saaf kar diya ki hamen to ladke or ladki dono waapas chahie
 Then the policeman came to his true colors and started demanding bribe
 kaali ram- ab ham aapke liye itnaa kooperate kar rahe hai
 Will not let any trouble happen
 wo aap dekho ki kitna meetha karnaa he, kitna feekaa karnaa he
 We had understood his gesture, we asked him how much it would take, he said - Kali Ram - 5 thousand
 
 
 chalo, de jaao
 This is his very religious work
 ankhon main rishwat kii chamak daudi to police vaala hamaari madad ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 We told Kali Ram that the boys and girls were waiting for someone in a nearby temple
 or yahi mauka he ki eesai kaliram unhen pakadakar hamaare hawaale kar de
 By law it is the duty of the police to present the boy and girl in the court, but in the heat of money, the police humbly forgot everything and walked with us towards the temple
 vahaan ghar se bhagkar shaadi karne vaale ladke-ladki ke bhesh main hamaare do reporter the
 After reaching there, we voiced (reporter) - reporter - Ae Munni
 
 Boy - no matter what you want to talk to me
 reporter- are hat ja
 
 ladkaa- nahin mujhase baat karo
 
 guddi- nahin main nahin jaaoongitab tak eesai kaali ram apane rang main aa chukaa tha
 He reached the police station with a boy and a girl
 ladke ko police stesan main baitaakar ladki se poochtacha ke liye hamaari gaadi main aa gaya
 Kali Ram- What is the name, Teralarki - Guddikali Ram - Nobody cares about you, your parents, your brother
 itnaa bada laanchhan laga diya, kya hoga samajhati he
 Understand how big a thing has happened, what has happened to respect
 ladki- use (ladke ko) chhod dokali ram- goli maar duungaa use or tuje bhildki- chhod doreporter- vaah besharm vaah, dekh rahe hai sahabakaali ram- kahaan gayi thi, kiske paas jaakar rahi thi
 Hanlarki - Where is it kept? Kali Ram - i will not leave him, will shoot you
 Why would you shoot Kali Ram - Kali Ram went inside the police station after threatening us with utter threat
 
 
 kyonki ab wo apane imaan kii keemat chahta tha
 
 
 Kali Ram - How many reports - Panchakali Ram - and Kara De Koi Reporters - Okay, i will give it to Kali Ram - and now i will hand it over to the boy (father)? Reporter - No, send it with us to Basakali Ram - will take it And then make me baseriporter - then i will make it a little more Ram - tight
 
 Yes, you take the reporter - Hey, take a thousand rupees and bring Ram, sit here and leave the chase
 thik he
 Otherwise life will be ruined
 dobaaraa shikaayat nahin aegi, thik he naa pandit ji
 And if the complaint comes again, then it will not be okay
 haa
 We were surprised to see how easily the policeman was ready to hand over the girl's house instead of presenting the girl-boy in court

 We also told the same fictional story to Karamveer that our girl escaped with her lover and now we want to take both of them into our possession
 eesai karamvir ne badi aasaani se hami bhar lee ki wo ladkaa-ladki ko hamaare hawaale kar degaa
 Also, he told about the easy way of honor killing
 eesai karamvir- ab to ye he ki agar wo mil jate hai to ladki ko ham aapako de denge
 Get her married
 agar naakhush he to jo aapkaa vichaar he wo karo, lekin main ijaajat nahin duungaa ki wo kaam karo
 Is the biggest sin
 or zyaada dikkat aa jaae, to 
 
 
 Beat the same thing reporter- yahi karnaa padegaa ab to
 Karamveer - If you do this work, then outside your area
 
 
 kahin jhaadiyon-vodiyon main daal do
 
 ghar ke paas nahin
 
 
 Reporter- Yes, away from home, what else? 
 
 karamvir- kisi nadi-vadi main daal do
 
 
 Will melt
 
 
 
 
 kii chali jaaegi kahin
 
 khaaki ko khap panchayaton kaa himachati banane kaa rog sirf haryana main he yaa duusare rajyon main bhi ye sankraman fail chukaa he
 To find out, we reached the Kulesra police post of Greater Noida in UP adjacent to Delhi
 vahaan hamaari izzat daanv par lagane kii kaalpanik kahani sunate hi sab inspector ajay singh maanavadhikaar ayog ko kosne lage
 Ajay Singh, SI- All these commissions these days are human rights commissions, these laws which have been passed around the world, these have passed in Parliament, these only
 
 
 
 Are to protect them
 ise achche aadmi kii madad ke liye nahin banaaya he
 Today if someone has a reward of 50 thousand rupees and the police kills him, then the police
 
 i have nothing against him
 usne meraa koi nuksaan nahin kiya, mere parivaar kaa kuch nahin bigaada he
 But we kill him
 maarthe hai samaaj ke hit ke liye, kyonki wo zindaa rahegaa to pataa nahin kitno ko or maaregaa
 Fine
 lekin usko maarane ke baad bhi kitne aise mukademe hai, jo police jhel rahi he
 It was clear from the words of Sub Inspector Ajay Singh of Kulesra post that he hated the law of the country and sympathized with the Khap Panchayats
 ladki ne apni marzi se shaadi kar lee, to birdari main naak cat gai
 There is no shortage or lack of such thinking people who are helpful to those who take their lives for saving false pride
 apane sting oparation ke dauraan hamaara saamana aise kai police waalon se hua
 a policeman involved in the same network of Khap police told that such a way, even if the snake dies and sticks are not broken
 is saal march main karnal ke veda prakaash ko police kii maujuudagi main khap panchayat ne peet petakar maar daalaa kyonki usne apane gotra kii ladki sonia se shaadi kar lee thi
 We are narrating this statement so that you can know how the policemen also agree with the decrees in Khap Panchayats

 Sheeshpal, Head Constable - Hum again from the girl
 
 
 aegi to he hi ladki
 
 ladki hamaare saamne aakar bolegi kuch
 
 
 Think ahead
 maan lo agar shaadi kar rakhi ho, court marij kar rakhi ho to aap kya kar loge? to naa tum karo naa ham kuch kar paaenge
 Brother, if the court is kept in marriage, then i do not agree that we are capable of speaking anything, nor are you worth speaking
 vahaan dikkat aegi naa
 Why should we talk nonsense
 head consteble shishpal ne apana tazurba bataaya ki ladke ko farji cese main fansaana koi badi baat nahin hai
 Shishpal -
 
 
 ko jail bhej denge
 Somewhere
 
 
 ko thok-peet ke jail main bhej denge
 In the case of NDPS
 
 
 ladki ko cese main kyon laaun? nahin to ladki ko yahaan laana padegaa, court ke chakkar kyon katwauun?rohtak se greater noida tak ham jin police chaukiyon main gaye, vahaan hamen ek bhi aisa police vaala nahin mila, jisane ghar se faraar premi jode ko pakad kar adaalat main pesh karne kii baat kii ho
 When Aaj Tak's under cover team came out to conduct a sting operation of the policemen, the story of the girl's escape was fictitious
 phir bhi police waalon ko saaf-saaf bataa diya gaya tha ki ladkaa-ladki donon balig hai
 By law, the policemen should have filed all the reports in the journal, but nothing like this happened
 police waalon ne bas paison kii dling kii or shuru ho gaya unka gaiyrkanoonee ection
 While starting the action on our fictional story, these policemen did not even enter the police station's entry, even though this should have been their first job
 ulate police vaale kanoon kaa hi makhul udaate hai
 According to the experts of the law, even if a case comes to the police, it can investigate the FIR by filing it
 wo ladke or ladki ko castady main lekar unhen adaalat main pesh kar sakati he or phir aage kaa kaam adaalat kaa he
 Whether the boy or the girl is a minor or a minor, it is decided by the court
 ladki naaballig ho to ladke par apharan kaa mukadmaa chalata he or ladki agar balig ho to wo khud faisla karti he ki use kiske saath rahanaa he
 But, these policemen kept the court-law aside and became the guard of Khap mentality themselves
