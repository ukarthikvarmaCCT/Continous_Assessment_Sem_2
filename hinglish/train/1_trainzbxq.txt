 Input: IANS pragati maidan ke haul number 12 main vishwa pustak mela 2019 ke lekhak manch par 'sahitya ajtak' kaa yah satr sabase alahada tha
 This was due to the presence of Shruti Aggarwal, the translator of the book 'jorba the Greek' by the Greek writer Nikos Kazanzakis Nikos Kazantzakis
 bhartiya bhashaaon main likhi kitabon, arth, khel, maanviya samvednaa, kashmir or kedarnath haadase ke baad ab ham vishwa sahitya kii taraf, vah bhi ‘nirvana’ jaise vishay kii taraf bad chuke the
 Nikos Kazanzakis was one of Europe's greatest writers, who has been recommended for the Nobel Prize almost nine times
 unki yah prakhyat pustak, hindi main ab jaakar chhapi he
 The special thing of this session is that by the time the book fair was over by this time, the enthusiasm of the audience was not lacking
 'jorba da greek' ke bare main anuvadak shruti agarwal kahana tha ki jab is kitaab ke anuwaad ke baad mujhe isaki bhoomika likhane ke liye kaha gaya to maine ek line main sabase upar likhaa, jivan ko mukt hokar jeene kii kala sikhaati pustak
 Here i would like to clarify that it teaches life to be free and not free
 mukt or unmukt donon main bahut antar he
 In 1946, this book came in Yunani language
 isaki ahmiyat kaa anumaan aise laga sakate hai ki jab apane prakaashan ke chha saal baad 'jorba da greek' kaa angreji anuwaad chapa, to angl sahitya jagat ne ise apni badi bhuulon main se ek qaraar diya ki is kitaab ke angreji main aane main itane saal lag gaye
 Think, when the English literature world felt this, it took more than seventy years for this book to be published in Hindi
 maatrubhaasha, ham jab sabase pehle bolte hai to maa shabd aata he
 The happiness and comfort in Hindi is not in any other language
 maine isiilie is kitaab kaa anuwaad hindi main kiya
 'jorba the Greek' is the story of a man named Jorba
 ek aise vyakti ki jisase ek unani lekhak miltaa he
 This writer is Nikos himself
 vah vyakti jivan kaa utsav manaata he or buddhatv paata he
 While living life he finds nirvana like Buddha
 bhartiya patrakarita kaa pind he rashtrawaad, phir isse gurej kyon?is kahani main jorba kahata he ki vah jaanata he ki vah kabhi nahin maregaa
 So he lives every moment as if his life is yet to go on
 isiilie jab vah koi galati karata he, koi bhul karata he, kyonki vah dwitiya vishwayuddh kii vibhishika ko na keval jhel chukaa hota he balki usamen shaamil bhi rahaa he
 He has not only fought wars, committed murders and rapes, committed many wrongdoings, so to repair them, he does not repent and drown in depression, but starts a new chain of life, and other people who are wrong
 Tries to stop them
 kehete hai na ki agar aapako everest kii chadhaai kerani he to peeth kaa boj kam karnaa hoga
 The introduction of this book in Hindi was also important because not only suicides are happening due to depression but people are giving up their lives
 osho, jinhen is sadi kaa sabase bada vichaarak kaha jaataa he unke adhikansh vichaaron par is kitaab kaa asar he
 This book is about a person who is wandering here and there in search of Buddha, he does not join anyone, because he feels it is a bond of attachment
 tab uski jindagi main ek karmchaaree ke rup main jorba aata he
 Jorba tells him that unless you live life enthusiastically, do not drown in it, then how will you be detached from it
 2013 kii tabaahi shiv kaa sandesh tha ki kedarnath main mandir ke sivaa kuch or nahinjorba use bataata he ki jab vah chota tha to use cheri khaane kii aadat thi
 He loved her so much that he used to eat it anyway
 cheri ke liye kai baar vah maar bhi khaataa tha
 Used to steal several times
 ek baar usne chaandi kaa sikaa churaayaa or teen-chaar tokariyaan cheri le aayaa
 At first i ate full for two-three days, but if the cherry is not finished, then started swallowing it
 iske chalate vah itnaa biimaar ho gaya ki se cheri se hi nafrat ho gai
 In the book, Nikos says that if you have to go towards Nirvana, then you have to go on living, and if you do not enjoy every aspect of it then how will you get Nirvana
 is kitaab main do mukhya charitra hai bos or jorba
 Both are living in their own way, but the path of Nirvana is the path of Jorba
 isiilie 'jorba da greek' ke baad 'jorba da buddha' kitaab bhi ai
 This book is not just a book
 yah ek aisi kitaab he jo aapkaa jivan badal degi
 Translator Shruti Agarwal said that i quit my job for this book
 vajah yah thi ki nicos kaa sandesh bahut bada tha
 He does not run away from life and encourages him to live vibrantly
 vah kehete hai ki agar kahin koi galati ho jaae to use jis had tak ho sake sudhaarney kii koshish kariye
 God also believes in punishment, not correction
 yah kitaab vishwa kii sarvaadhik bikne vaali kitabon main he
 The film made on this book had come before my birth in 1964, now i was able to translate it at the age of forty

 samiti main samaaj ke sadsy aravind kejariwal or prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki naagarik ghoshnaptr or saarvajanik shikayaton ko lokapal ke adhikaar kshetra main rakhane ke alaava sarkaar ne pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika tathaa sansad ke bheetar saansadon ke bhrasht krityon ko lokapal ke daayre main laaye jane kaa virodh kiya
 He said that today's proposals of the government were worse than their earlier proposals
 un prastaavon kii bhartsana kii gayi or unhen khaarij kar diya gaya
 Kejriwal said that in the latest bill of the government, the Prime Minister was placed under its ambit but the government backed away from it
 samiti ke sadasyon ke bich aaj sahmati nahin ban paane ke kaaran sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki vah matbhed ke in muddon par rajyon or raajnneetik dalon ko likhegi or unki raay maangegi
 After this, on June 6, after knowing the opinion of all the parties, he will again discuss in the committee
 sibbal ne kaha ki rajyon kii raay jaanane kii jarurat he kyonki lokayuktaon kii niyukti vahaan kii jaani he
 Bhushan said that government representatives told him that by bringing the post of Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal, he will be executed
 unhone dhyaan dilaayaa ki sarkaar ke vidheyak main bhi pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke tahat laane kaa praavdhaan he tathaa abhi tak vah bhrashtachar ke muddon par jaanch ke daayre se baahar nahin he
 Bhushan said, "we only want it to fall within the purview of an impartial agency and not an agency that is under self-government
" isse hiton kaa takaraav hota he
 'kejriwal lamented,' The Prime Minister wants his activities to be investigated not by an impartial agency but by an agency like the CBI which is under him
 ’ samiti kii baithak main mukherjee ke saath saath sarkaar kii ore se grih mantri pi chidambaram, kanoon mantri kapil sibbal, alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri salmaan khurshid or kanoon mantri em virappa moili ne bhi bhaag liya
 Hazare, Shanti Bhushan and Prashant Bhushan, Kejriwal and Santosh Hegde attended the meeting on behalf of the society
 samaaj ke sadsy chaahate he ki lokapal ke paas yah adhikaar hona chahie ki vah puri naukarshahi main kisi bhi vyakti ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kar saken or is maamle main varishthata kii koi seemaa nahin tay kii jaani chahie
 In this case, the Government is of the view that only officers of the level of Joint Secretary or above should come under the purview of this law
 saansadon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki lokapal yaadi sansad ke baahar ke bhrashtachar ke muddon kii jaanch karata he to use koi aapatti nahin he
 But it opposed the proposal to allow the Lokpal to investigate acts of corruption by mps within Parliament
 kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki vidheyak ke daayre se raksha adhikariyon ko alag rakhaa janaa chahie
 He said that the government is of the view that the offices of the Chief Vigilance Commissioner and CBI should not be merged with the Lokpal
 baharhaal, samaaj ke sadasyon ne sarkaar ke daavon ko khaarij kar diya or uski pratikriya par niraashaa jataayi
 Kejriwal said that there were many fundamental differences on the bill today
 sarkaar chaahati he ki ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke bheetar saansadon ke krityon main bhrashtachar ke mudde par ‘‘aatm niyaman’’ hona chahie

 mumbai main rashtriya aadhunik kala sangrahalay (engieme)main pichley hafte chitrakaar prabhakar barve kii smriti main ho rahi ek charchaa ke dauraan diggaj abhinayta or nirdeshak amol palekar ko apane vichaar rakhane ke dauraan baar-baar tokaa gaya
 With this, the debate on freedom of expression once again took place
 palekar ko apane vishay par hi kendrit rahane ko kaha gaya
 An invited speaker was not allowed to speak what they wanted to say, rather the decision was made by the people who invited him to speak
 or phir jaise hi unki baat jabariyaa samaapt karwaai gai, engieme ke nideshak ne microphone par unhen yaad dilaayaa ki ve 'ek sarkari gailaree' main bol rahe the, maano unhone santhaan ko palekar ke haathon hone vaale kisi aparaadh se bachaa liya
 Jessel Thakkar, the curator of Barve's overview, is not formally affiliated with the NGMA
 par unhone jor dekar kaha ki kaarykram barve ko yaad karne ke liye kiya gaya tha or palekar kaa bhaashan vishay se bahut bhatak rahaa tha
 She says, "I stand for art and artists and i was not opposed to Palekar at all
 meraa iraadaa unhen apana bhaashan puraa karne se rokna bilkul nahin tha
 It was just to request them to share as many tales or memories about an artist whose event was being held 24 years after his death
 '' ek kalakaar or mumbai main engiemke kii salaahkaar samiti ke purv adhyaksh suhas bahulkar kii baton kaa bhi kuch aisa hi labbolubaab tha
 The bottom line of Palekar's complaint was that he had heard, the NGMA is planning to abolish advisory committees and in fact the committees have already been dissolved, so now government officials will likely decide on ideological or ethical grounds
 phone par baat karte hue bahulkar kehete hai ki unhone sarkaar ko kathith prakriyaatmak badlaavon ke bare main likhaa tha, lekin ''barve kii pradarshnee ko kalakaar kii nishtha or eemaandaaree ke liye samarpit hona chahie tha
 "they say it is 'really sad' that the issue has been politicized
" sarkaar kii ore se engieme kaa daawa he ki salaahkaar samitiyon kii vyavastha ko samaapt nahin kiya gaya he
 All that has happened is that the tenure of those committees is over and they are now 'in the process of restructuring'
 palekar kii chintaa kaa ek paksh engieme kii us niti ke prati bhi he jisamen sanstha ne apane sthaayee sangrah ke hi zyada se zyada pradarshan kii spasht ichha darshai he, jisase nae kaam ke liye kam jagah milti he
 For this reason, instead of displaying the work of artists like Sudhir Patwardhan and Mehli Gobhai earlier, it could not be found in its gallery and the program had to be canceled
 shaayad palekar ke uthaae gaye vishyon par pratikriya dete hue engieme ne kaha he ki kiraye ke liye kitni jagah uplabdh hogi, is par nirnay hona abhi baaki he
 In a press conference and various interviews, Palekar said he was shocked by the way in which he was troubled by questions on his justification
 ek kalakaar ke sirf kaam par charchaa karne ke alaava kalakaar kii uplabdhiyon par charchaa ke anya tareeke bhi hai
 He said that he would not have accepted the invitation if he had known what to speak and what he would not have decided to discuss with Thakkar in advance
 palekar ne kaha ki ve unki baat main lagaataar khadi kii ja rahi rukaawaton or kamare main baithe 'varisht kalakaaron' kii chuppi se 'aahat' the
 No explanation has been given as to why they could not conclude the speech
 haalanki aayojakon kaa maananaa tha ki ve jo baaten kah rahe the ve kaarykram ke anuroop nahin thim
 An invited speaker who is also a big artist himself and who knew Barve personally, why can't he be given the freedom to speak openly even if he is going a little off topic

 hamane tab bhi aisa hi kiya tha or ab bhi aisa hi karenge
 " ye series test main best kaa elaan karegi
 Many experts are saying that after the series, the gap between the world's No
1 team India (121 points in ICC rankings) and the world No

 From strategy, mind games and opposition khilari to sledging, the kangaroo is seen in the tavar lagam
 duusari taraf bhartiya team ek hi andaaz main baat kar rahi he
 Like coach Anil Kumble, captain Virat is focused on his team's goal while the visiting team seems to be adjusting according to the Indian strategy
 tippaniyan The picture is clearly visible on the Pune pitch
 isliye pehle test kii ranneeti yaa team chayan ko lekar koi bada sarprize saamne nazar aata nahin dikhataa
 Pitch curator Pandurang Salgavkar says that the pitch will turn from the second or third day but this pitch will not prove to be a strong turner
 captain viraat kohli bhi kuch aisi hi pich kii ummid kar rahe hai
 The Australian team, who usually make sledging a big weapon, is careful about their attitude towards Virat Kohli
 magar viraat in sabase beparwaah dikhte hai
 Speaking to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar also says that there is an excessive emphasis on sledding before the series

 By the way, Virender Sehwag believes that if Dij seems to be the law of averages, then the Indian team can play a Test draw or even lose in the series

 But Virat seems to be most inattentive
 NDTV se baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar bhi kehete hai ki series se pehle sledging par zarurat se zyaada jor diya ja rahaa he
 Captain Virat, who has been away from defeat in 19 consecutive Tests, is clear that Team India will try to break them by constantly pressing against Australia like in the previous series

 sadabahaar jaik kallis ke bejod shatak or shuru main hi do karaare jhatkon se baikfoot par pahunche bharat ne salaami balalebaj gautam gambhir or sachin tendulkar kii satark pariyon se dakshin africa ke khilaaf tisare or antim test cricket match ke duusare din acchhee vaapasi kii
 Kallis played his 39th century by playing the role of anchor
 unhone antim ballebaaj ke rup main out hone se pehle 161 ran banaae, jisase dakshin africa ne 362 ran kaa chunauteepurn score khadaa kiya
 India then lost two wickets for 28 runs, but the unbroken partnership of 114 runs in 39 overs for the third wicket between Gambhir (65 not out) and Tendulkar (49 not out) left them two wickets till the end of the second day's play
 But managed to reach 142 runs
 bharat ab bhi dakshin africa se 220 ran peeche he
 South Africa were up for 283 for eight wickets and found it difficult to reach 300 runs, but Kallis added 79 runs with the last two batsmen Paul Harris (7) and Lonwabo Tsotsobe (8 not out) giving the team
 Reached a good score
 bharat kii taraf se srisanth ne 114 ran dekar paanch, jahir khan ne 89 ran dekar teen or ishanth sharma ne 77 ran dekar do wicket liye
 India did not have a good start and Dale Steyn soon cooled off Virender Sehwag's (13) offensive stance
 iske baad rahul dravid (5) bhi ran out hokar pavilion laut gaye, lekin do jeevandaan paane vaale gambhir or pagabaadha kii do vishwasaneey apilon se bachane vaale tendulkar ne bharat ko aage jhatka nahin lagane diya
 Dravid took a cautious approach, but ironically he was run out on the ball that Gambhir missed
 sotsobe kii gend par gali main elviro petersan ne gambhir kaa kaich choda, lekin slip main kshetrarakshan kar rahe abi divilliars ne daud lagaakar gend pakadi or striker chor par wicket ukhadkar dravid ko pavilion bhej diya
 After Gambhir was on 60, De Villiers left his catch in the slip on the same ball of Sotsobe
 tendulkar ne sahajata se apni pari aage badhaai
 Meanwhile, Morkel tried to remove pressure on the team by hitting two fours in one over
 paul haris ne 26wein over main unke khilaaf pagabaadha kii vishwasaneey apil kii, lekin simon tuffel ne use thukraa diya
 However, from the replay it seemed that the ball would have been on the leg stump
 gambhir ne iske baad agle over main sotsobe par midwicket par chaukaa jadkar apana 15waan ardhashatak puraa kiya
 However, both of these batsmen were extremely cautious and scored very slowly in the last hour and a half
 gambhir ne ab tak 159 gend kaa saamana karke aath chauke or tendulkar ne 106 gend khelkar paanch chauke lagaae hai

 It is believed that if Naresh Aggarwal, Raja Bhaiya and Shivpal Yadav play with their supporters then it will be difficult for the BSP candidate to win, but after the victory this alliance is fresh and it seems that their mlas are from the party Hardly the path of revolt is chosen and this is what is striking the BJP the most
 dalit ke khilaaf vaishyarajya main sattarudh bijepi kii ek badi samasya yah bhi he ki usne dalit candidet or vah bhi bhimrao ambedkar ke naam ke candidet ke khilaaf apana ummidavaar utaara he or vah bhi vaisya jati kaa
 In such a situation, BJP trying to make inroads among Dalits may also have to answer why it tried to defeat the name of Bhimrao Ambedkar
 bataa den ki upachunaav ke nateezon ke pehle bijepi ne samaajawaadee party ko bhi haraane kaa man banaaya tha
 This is the reason he had two more candidates, but with the defeat of the Rajya Sabha, both those candidates withdrew their pamphlets
 ek taraf gathbandhan jeet-haar ke bhavar main fansaa he to bijepi dalit ke khilaaf vaisya ummidavaar utaarne ke kashmakash main fansi he ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki rajyasabha kaa yah chunaav kis par kitna baari padataa he
 The robbers broke into a bank and looted cash and ornaments worth fifty lakh rupees while carrying out an audacious incident in Mainpuri district of Uttar Pradesh
 dindahaade hui is lut kii vaardaat se puure shahar main hadkamp much gaya
 The case is about the crowded court route of Mainpuri
 jahaan ativyast kachhari maarg par sadar tehsil bhawan ke paas kenrabenkki shakha he
 Where it was quite crowded due to being a Monday
 police ne bataaya ki dopaher paanch sashastr nakaabposh lutere ne bank main ghus gaye
 The robbers first locked all the employees and consumers there in a room at gunpoint
 is dauraanluteronke do saathi bank shakha ke main get par khadey ho gaye
 As soon as he took possession of the branch, he removed the leads of all closed circuit television cameras installed in the premises
 sutron ke mutabik nakaabposh luteron ne bank ke strang room par dhaava bol diya
 The crooks escaped from the spot by looting cash and jewelery kept there
 ve bank se pachaas lakh kii nagdi or gahane lut le gaye
 After the incident, the shopkeepers and others present in the nearby neighborhood took out the bank employees and customers in the room after hearing the noise
 iske baad police ko vaardaat ke bare main soochna di gai
 Police and bank top officials also reached the spot as soon as the information was received
 police ne shahar kii nakebandi kar luuteron ko talashne kii koshish kii lekin unka koi suraag nahin mil sakaa
 The police have registered a case and started searching for the robbers
 piem modi kii varanasi yatra kai myanon main mahatvapurn he lekin unhone vahaan ke lakhon bunakaron kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye jo baaten kahin ve sargarbhit hai
 His saying that every mother wants her daughter to wear a Banarasi sari on her wedding is a very forward looking statement
 banarsi saadiyaan sadiyon se saadiyon kaa sirmaur rahi hai
 They are a heritage given at the daughter's wedding
 banarsi saadiyon ne na keval varanasi ko ek pratishtha di he balki vahaan hajaaron bunakaron or kaarigaron ko roji-roti di he
 This keeps the economy there and also burns a stove in thousands of homes
 lekin haal ke varshon main jaise ki banarsi sari ke vyavsaay par grahan lag gaya
 Their sales started decreasing
 nai peedi kii ladakiyon main iske prati ruchi kam ho gai, bichauliyon ne bhi bunakaron ko khub thaga, rajya sarkaar ne unke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 As a result, Banarasi saris, once called the pride of India, started getting lost in the darkness of oblivion
 ek ore bunakaron ke saamne roji-roti kii samasya khadi ho gai duusari ore ek faltaa-phulataa vyavsaay thaharne laga
 The ancestral business of weaving sari started to end and weavers and artisans started migrating in search of employment
 kisi ne unki sud nahin he
 Despite the fact that most of the weavers are minorities, the political parties who talked long and wide about their interests remained silent
 unke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Now by referring to this, the PM has tried to weave a golden future for thousands of weavers engaged in the work of Banarasi sarees
 jo log bhartiya arthvyavastha ke vibhinn pahaluon se parichit hai unhen pataa hoga ki saikadon varshon se chal rahaa bhartiya kapadaa udyog desh kaa doosraa sabase bada udyog he or yah saade teen karod logon ko sidhe rojgaar detaa he or lagbhag itane hi log isamen apratyaksh rup se lage hue hai
 The British did much to destroy it but they did not succeed
 lekin isane vipareet paristhitiyon main bhi apane ko bachaae rakhaa
 Millions of artisans living in every corner of the country cut their stomach and saved it
 bharat ke kapade sari duniya main export hote rahe hai lekin 2009 main ai mandi ne ise musiibat main daal diya
 Our exports had a bad effect and thousands of units were shut down
 lakhon karigar berozegaar ho gaye
 China's silk put our silk industry in jeopardy and the question of survival was raised in front of it
 iskaa asar banarsi saadiyon par bhi padaa
 It is a matter of pleasure that PM Modi has attracted the attention of this industry by referring to Banarasi sarees
 ummid kii ja sakati he ki unki baat suni jaaegi or is udyog ko badhaava dene ke liye bade kadam uthaae jaaenge

 Inflation of petrol and diesel prices has started to show on inflation and due to this, inflation rose to 10 in June
 55 pratishat par pahunch gai
 Inflation 10 a month ago
 16 pratishat thi
 However, one reason for the high inflation in June is also the comparative figures a year earlier
 beete saal june main mudrasphiti shunya se 1
 Had fallen by 01 percent
 mudrasphiti lagaataar chauthe maheene dohare ank main bane rahane se rigerv bank par pramukh byaaj daren badhaane kaa dabaav bad gaya he or vah 27 july ko maudrik niti samiksha baithak main kuch kade kadam uthaa saktaa he
 The Reserve Bank has raised key rates three times later this year and experts expect rates to rise by a further one-fourth percent
 udhar, vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne bharosa jataayaa ki kharif kii fasal bazaar main aane ke saath saal ke ant tak mudrasphiti ghatakar 5-6 pratishat par aa jaaegi
 On the other hand, PMEAC member Govind Rao said, 'july figures will be slightly up
 rigerv bank or chauthai pratishat kii badhotaree pramukh daron main kar saktaa he
 This time the increase in petroleum prices by the government in the last week of June had an impact on the inflation figures
 sarkaar ne motor eendhan ke daamon ko niyantran mukt karne kaa nirnay karte hue mitti ke tel or rasoyee gas ke daam bhi badaye
 Kerosene prices increased by 9 percent, electricity by 4 percent, petrol by 2 percent and LPG by 3 percent during the month
 7 pratishat kii badhotaree darj kii gai
 The government's Chief Economic Advisor Kaushik Basu said last month that he expected inflation to rise by one percent as fuel prices rose
 isse pehle jari sarkari aankadon ke anusaar 19 june ko samaapt ke khaadya vastuon ke mulya suchakank par aadhaarit khaadya mudra sfiti kuch kam ho kar 12
 Came to 63 percent
 isse purv ke aatha saptaah se khaadya mudrasphiti 16 pratishat se upar chal rahi thi
 With inflation remaining in the double digits, there may be pressure on the Reserve Bank to raise key rates
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki july main mudrasphiti or badhane kii sambhaavna he kyonki petrol or dijal ke bade hue daamon kaa puraa asar abhi saamne aana baaki he

 If the longest poem of famous poet Vinod Kumar Shukla is played on the raipur-bilaspur division stage, what will be the result? When the ruggedness of this long poem opened in front of a select audience in Raipur (chhattisgarh), it became more effective than the text
 nirdeshak yoga mishra the or use saakaar kiya tha abhinayta sanjeev mukherjee ne
 If the thing in the text came into the scene then it became a text
 na paath ne drishy kaa aadhiky machaaya or na drishy ne paath kii mahatta dhoomil kii
 This concordance became the central beauty of the color conversion of this poem
 aam taur par pragatishiltaa main dubkee lagaakar apana kumbh snaan samajhane vaale nirdeshak kavita ko janagit se upar uthakar dekh nahin pate
 Yog Mishra abruptly broke the illusion that poems that encircle the questions are just an object of screaming in an incoherent manner
 haalanki unhone kisi gey yaa layadaar frem vaali kavita ke gayan main apni urja nahin ganvaai
 His fondness for poetry put him on Shukla's early poetry collection, the man wearing a new hot coat, the most famous poem of the kind, Raipur Bilaspur division
 bina kisi chhedchhad ke unhone ise ek abhinayta se taiyaar bhi kar liya
 This poem communicating with itself like a monologue, seems to be the entire structure of Chhattisgarh

 The whole poem is as if there is a rousing song
 anand is baat kaa ki manchan rajdhani main saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke agua afasar subhash mishra ke nivas ke angan main ho rahaa tha
 The greenery spread around the back of the wall, acting like wings

 So many body movements that the poem is close to the audience
 prayog pehla lekin pehlepan kii koi ladkadaahat nahin
 Many new audiences did not say that the innovation of yoga was meaningful

 ’ The government has started the process of framing rules for auction of coal blocks just before the commencement of the session of Parliament after drafting an ordinance on coal

 Experts are saying that when the Supreme Court has canceled all the coal block allocations, the Center has a golden opportunity to auction the coal mines in a phased manner and preserve the mines in dense forests and biodiversity areas for now
 
 supreme court ne pichley dinon 214 koyala blokon ke aavanton ko radd kiya tha, jinamein se kam se kam ek tihaai ghaney jangalon vaale ilaake main he
 Many of these coal blocks are in areas where tribals live and these areas are known for biodiversity and prized flora
 isliye in kol blox ke aasapaas maujuud paryaavaran or saamaajik parivesh kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa bhi jaruri he
 For example, Sonbhadra has been struggling on this basis for a long time with the forests of Mahan nearby
 koyala ghotaale main yachikakarta rahe sudeep shrivastav kehete hai ki desh main jitna koyale ke bhandar hai unamem 15 fisadi se bhi kam ghaney jangalon main hai
 The rest of the coal blocks - which are outside the dense forests - have enough coal to meet India's needs for 70 to 80 years, so what is the need to auction these densely forested coal blocks first? ” ye baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki supreme court ke saamne jab koyala ghotaale par bahes hui to khadaanon ke aavanton ko lekar paryaavaran or saamaajik parivesh par padane vaale asar par charchaa nahin hui
 However, many cases were pending before the National Green Tribunal (NGT)
 isliye is maamle par abhi ek asamanjas bana hua he ki aage kya hoga
 It is believed that once the auction of densely forested coal blocks is done again, many cases may come up for hearing before the tribunal once again

 2019 kaa chunaav vah avasar lekar aayaa he jisamen bhaajapa ko apane dam par bahumat na mila to kshetreey dalon kii bhoomika mahatvapurn ho jaaegi
 However, kcr's ambitions exceed the expectation of this political opportunity
 ve itnaa hi nahin chaah rahe hai ki centre main upie yaa endie bahumat se dur rahen or sarkaar banane ke liye kshetreey dalon par nirbhar hona pade
 Based on his feedback, Rao is assuming that the Congress will be reduced from 100 to 110 seats and the BJP will not be able to win more than 125-150 seats
 tiares netaa ve
 Vinod Kumar says that "both BJP and Congress together will not be able to win more than 250 seats in total
" jabaki gaiyr bhaajapa-gaiyr congress dalon kii siton kii sankhya 150-160 hone kii ummid he
 "but how will the government be formed at the center with so many seats?" In Kumar's opinion, "that is why KCR is in touch with Stalin and Palaniswami
" '' arthath kesiar upie or endie main shaamil dalon ko bhi sanyukt morche ke binar tale laakar centre main sanyukt morcha sarkaar banane kii pahal main gambhirtha se lage hai
 How easy it is that Rakescr may be taking initiative for united front but his path is not easy
 bada sawaal morche ke netritv ko lekar he
 Among the contenders are leaders like Mamta, Mayawati, Chandrababu and KCR themselves
 inamen aapas main hi ek duusare ko lekar sahmati bananaa kathin he
 Another major problem will be the involvement of UPA and NDA partners
 ensipi, rajd, diemke, lojpa, lospa, shivasena, apana dal jaisi partiyon ke netaa rashtriya dalon ke sahyogi ke rup main judye main sahaj hote hai lekin rashtriya dalon ke binar se pare jaakar aise gathbandhan main hissedari se parhez karte hai jiske netaa yaa dal kaa swaroop rashtriya nahin hota
 The third problem is that many of the parties that are being involved in the front have contested in their states against each other
 masalan chandrababu naidu or jagan mohan reddy andhra pradesh main, tiemasi or left partiyaan bengal main
 In the midst of all these adversities, what is the hope of a united front or the future of the initiative? Says a leader close to KCR, "given the kind of opposition Modi has in most political parties in the country, the formation of a united front is simple and possible, despite all the adverse situations
" congress yaa upie main shaamil partiyaan bhi aasaani ke saath is morche kaa saath dene ko raji ho jaaengi
 Because stopping Modi is the first priority of all parties
 '' philhal kesiar sanyukt morcha banane ke liye lagaataar vibhinn dalon ke netaaon se sampark main hai
 Very soon he will meet Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Sharad Pawar, Tejashwi Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Naveen Patnaik
 tiares ke netaa is baat kii pushti karte hai ki agle kuch dinon main kesiar kai dalon ke netaaon se milane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 And you will meet at least till 23 May
 thussiyasat kii muskanchennai main diemke ke stallin se milte telugana ke mukhyamantri chandrashekhar raav The T20 World Cup league match will be played between India and Pakistan on Saturday
 is match main koun jitegaa yah kahana to mushkil he, lekin yah ummid kii ja rahi he ki donon timen shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue darshakon ke dil jeetne main kaamyaab hongi
 Do you know that the oldest captain of this World Cup, Shahid Afridi, has a unique record
 yah ek aisa record he, jis record kaa hakdaar koi bhi khilaadi nahin bananaa chahta he na hi afridi ne aisa chaha hoga
 Afridi holds the record for the most number of dismissals in T20 World Cup
 afridi tii20 world cap ke pehle captain hai jinke naam yah record he
 Afridi has been out for zero five times in 31 innings
 is record ne na sirf afridi lki srilanka ke ballebaaj tillakaratne dilashaan ko bhi pareshaan karke rakhaa he
 Dilshan has also been out at zero five times and he is at number two in this list, but Afridi has many such records that he would be happy about
 shahid afridi ne tii20 world cap main sabase teji se ran banaae hai, kehane kaa matlab yah he ki tii20 world cap main sabase zyada strike rate se kisi ne ran banaae hai to vah hai shahid afridi
 Afridi has scored 505 runs in 31 innings at an average of 20 and his strike rate is close to 156
 strike rate main duusare number par pakistan ke imran nazir hai or tisare number par england ke kevin petersan
 The comments tii20 world cap main shahid afridi ne apane aapako ek kaamyaab bowler ke rup main bhi sabit kiya he
 If we talk about taking the most wickets in the T20 World Cup, Afridi is second with 37 wickets while playing 31 matches, while Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is in first place
 malinga ne 31 match khelte hue 38 wicket liye hai
 But if we talk about T20, Afridi has got 95 wickets playing 95 matches
 kisi bhi bowler ke naam tii20 main yah sabase zyada wicket lene kaa world record he
 Shahid Afridi also holds the record for most T20 matches played
 kya aap jaanate he ki is world cap ke sabase bujurg captain shahid afridi ke naam ek anokhaa record he
 This is a record that no player deserves to be the record that Afridi would have wished
 tii20 world cap main sabase zyada baar shunya par out hone kaa record afridi ke naam he
 Afridi is the first T20 World Cup captain to hold this record
 afridi 31 inings main paanch baar shunya par out hue hai
 This record has not only upset Afridi but Sri Lankan batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan
 dilashaan bhi paanch baar shunya par out ho chuke hai or is list main vah duusare number par hai, lekin afridi ke naam kai aise ricards bhi hai, jise lekar vah khush honge
 Shahid Afridi has scored the fastest runs in T20 World Cup, to say that someone has scored the highest strike rate in T20 World Cup, then he is Shahid Afridi
 afridi ne 31 inings main kareeb 20 kii ausat se 505 ran banaae hai or unka strike rate 156 ke kareeb rahaa
 Pakistan's Imran Nazir is at number two in strike rate and England's Kevin Pietersen at number three
 tippaniyan Shahid Afridi has also proved himself as a successful bowler in the T20 World Cup
 agar tii20 world cap main sabase zyada wicket lene kii baat kiya jaae to afridi 31 match khelte hue 37 wicket ke saath duusare number par hai, jabaki srilanka ke tej gendbaaj lasith malinga pehle sthaan par hai
 Malinga has taken 38 wickets while playing 31 matches
 lekin agar tii20 kii baat kii jaae to afridi 95 match khelte hue 95 wicket hasil kar chuke hai

 bahujan samaaj party ne mangalvaar ko mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium (manaregaa) ke sambandh main congress mahasichav rahul gandhi dwaara mukhyamantri mayawati par lagaae gaye aaropon ko puri tarah jhootha evam galat bataaya
 The BSP said that the Chief Minister never spoke of the need for MNREGA
 basapa ke pradesh adhyaksh swami prasad maurya ne mangalvaar shaam ek bayaan jari kar rahul gandhi dwaara manaregaa ke sambandh main die gaye unke bayaan ko janvirohi bataaya or kaha ki unke ravaiye se spasht prathit hota he ki manaregaa ko lekar uttar pradesh kii sarkaar ke khilaaf damanaatmak kaarywahi kii ja rahi he
 He said that it seems from Rahul's statement that the central government wants to close the MNREGA in Uttar Pradesh
 gyaat ho ki rahul ne mangalvaar dopaher rajya main ek chunavi jansabha ke dauraan kaha ki jab centre sarkaar ne manaregaa shuru kiya to mukhyamantri mayawati ne kaha tha ki rajya main isaki jarurat nahin he
 People will not benefit from this
 main bhi maanata hum ki uttar pradesh main janata ko manaregaa se phayda nahin hoga kyonki sara dhan to mantri, afasar or thekedaar kha jaaenge
 Maurya said that the Chief Minister is strongly opposed to politics done about MNREGA
 manaregaa ke sambandh main pradesh kii janata ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he jabaki sabhi avgat hai ki pichley teen varsho main manaregaa ke kriyanyavan main uttar pradesh anya rajyon se kaaphi aage he
 Also, Uttar Pradesh is the first state in the country to fix minimum wages
 maurya ne kaha ki congress ke yuvaraj ko pataa hona chahie ki uttar pradesh main pichley do dashakon se janata congress ko haashie par daal chuki he
 The Congress's existence in the state is gradually shrinking, but Yuvraj says that the public is against the BSP
 maharashtra sarkaar ne khule main shouch par lagaam kasne ke liegud morning dastabanane kaa nirnay kiya he
 The government is engaged in making many efforts to stop open defecation, so that the mindset of such people can be changed
 sarkari sankalp jiaar main kaha gaya he ki ye good morning timen un ilaakon main nigaraanee karen jahaan yah chalan ab bhi chal rahaa he
 Also, see if people have access to toilets or not
 isamen kaha gaya he ki in tiimon main sthaneey nikaay, swayan sahaayta samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, chaatro ke pratinidhi or kshetra main swatchta ko lekar kaam karne vaale saamaajik kaaryakarta shaamil honge
 The GR states that these teams will have the power to take up the pending construction of toilets with the local body and help expedite the work
 khule main shouch jane waalo par kare sakht karrwaijiaar main kaha gaya he ki agar team ko aise log milte hai jo shauchalay kii suvidha hone ke baavjood khule main shouch ke liye jate hai to yah un par baari jurmaana lagaaegi
 Take strict action against them
 taaki jisase logon main is baat kii samaj viksit ho sake kii khule main shouch janaa sahi nahin he
 The government says that this campaign can prevent people from defecating
 jyotiraditya sindhiya (jyotiraditya Scindia) se jab samvaadadaataaon ne singhar dwaara purv mukhyamantri singh par lagaae gaye aaropon ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha, 'aarope gambhir hai or is par jarur donon pakshon ko baitaakar baat honi chahie
 The government should run on its own and on the basis, no one should interfere in the government
 isamen koi do raay nahin he
 'he further said,' Government should work independently
 jo mudde aae hai, us par mukhyamantri ko mantri umang singhar kii bhi baat sunani chahie or jo satya he usapar bhi karrwai honi chahie
 'let us tell you that former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh had written a letter to the ministers asking for an appointment, which went viral
 isse van mantri singhar naaraaz the
 He then accused Digvijay of giving protection to liquor traders, illegal miners
 is par rajya sarkaar ke jansampark mantri pisi sharma ne singhar ko aade haathon liya tha
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath intervened when the case caught on
 mukhyamantri se singhar kii mangalvaar raat mulaakaat hui
 According to sources, the Chief Minister instructed Singhar during the meeting
 singhar buudhvaar dopaher media ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki unki 'mukhyamantri kamalnath va pradesh prabharee baavariyaa se baat ho gai he
 Have put their point in front of them, now they have nothing to say
 'is bich, bhopal main vanmantri umang singhar ke ghar ke baahar unka hi putala jalaayaa gaya, putala jalaane vaale congressi kaaryakartaaon ne kaha ki jabatak umang singhar digvijay singh se maafee nahin maangege wo unka virodh karte rahenge
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia said that there should be no external interference in the government
 sarkaar ko swatantra hokar kaam karnaa chaiye, jo mudde aae hai mukhyamantri ko umang ji kii baat sunanaa chaiye jo satya he usapar kaary hona chaiye
 Digvijay Singh should also be talked to
 vahiin congress ke varisht vidhayak andal singh kanshana ne umang singhar ko barkhaast karne kii maang kar di
 He said that the Chief Minister should take immediate action against the ministers making such statements
 unhone kaha ki digvijay singh ne sarkaar banaai, sarkaar banane main sabase bada yogadan digvijay singh kaa hi rahaa unka jivan bedaag he
 He demanded that Chief Minister Umang Singhar, Govind Singh, Govind Singh Rajput, Imarti Devi Pradyuman Singh Tomar be sacked
 inamen se lagbhag saare naam sindhiya sarmathkon ke hai
 The answer also came from another faction, pro-scindia Transport Minister Govind Rajput also targeted Digvijay Singh and said that Digvijay Singh has no right to interfere in the government
 vah mantriyon ke adhikaron kaa hanan kar rahe hai or swatantraaa se kaam nahin karne de rahe hai
 At the same time, Labor Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia said that the people gave a majority to the Congress and formed a government in the state, rejecting the slogan of BJP, forgive Maharaj
 digvijay singh ji us samay kahaan the jab congressi sadakon par sangharsh kar rahe the
 At the same time, cabinet minister from Jabalpur, Lakhan Ghanghoria, in favor of Digvijay said that he did not do anything wrong by writing a letter to the ministers
 He is a big leader and can answer any question from any minister
 vahiin alirajpur jila congress adhyaksh mahesh patel ne umang singhar ko bijepi kaa dalal bataate diya
 Dhar MLA Hiralal Alava has also expressed dissatisfaction with the government
 alaava ne kaha ki sarkaar adivaasiyon ke hiton kii raksha nahin kar rahi he, to nirdaleey vidhayak surendra singh shera ne bhi spasht taur par kaha ki is sarkaar main hamaara bhavishya surakshit nahin he
 On the other hand, BJP is laughing at the pull of Congress
 bijepi pravaktaa rahul kothaari ne kaha congress kaaryakartaaon kaa ek hi kaam he apane sanghathan kii fajihat karnaa jo wo kar rahe hai, sindhiya ho, digvijay hon, umang singhar ho or khud kamalnath ke log koi peeche nahin chal rahaa he, ek raajnneetik kaaryakarta ke rup main isse kharaab din hamane kisi party ke nahin dekhe

 The flat dry land with famine-festoon cracks is bare bare like the saintly wife of the impotent husband

 a cow nearby is feeding the famine news paper

 The man has also gone away from cow and bull in this case

 Once i was eaten

 i cut it and swallowed it with water
 din bhar bhukh nahin lagi
 Nowadays, only half the pages of newspapers are published with news of famine and starvation
 agar akaal grast aadmi sadak par padaa akhbaar uthaakar utane panne kha le, to maheene bhar bhukh nahin lage
 But the man of this country is a fool
 ann khaanaa chahta he
 Don't want to eat the news of starvation

 a story by Blasphemy Raschekhav is missing
 ek stri kisi saheli ke pati kii ninda apane pati se kar rahi he
 He is a very sneaky, traitorous man
 beyimaani se paisa kamata he
 It is said that if i had been the place of that friend, i would have abandoned such a husband
 tab uskaa pati uske saamne yah rahasy kholta he ki vah swayan beyimaani se itnaa paisa kamata he
 The woman is shocked after listening
 kya usne pati ko tyaag diya? ji haa, vah duusare kamare main chali gai
 Sometimes it happens that if someone does what we do not have the ability to do, then our fluffy ego gets pushed, we get inferiority and remorse
 tab ham uski ninda karke usase apane ko acha samajhakar tusht hote hai
 All this is coming to mind about ten to twelve hours after meeting a friend
 ab kuch tatasth ho gaya hum
 When i was sitting with him in the morning, i used to drown in the Black Sea of self-condemnation, was chanting
 bada ras he na ninda main
 Surdas has therefore called it blasphemous Sabd Rasal

 Why go left? Sadho man of our country cannot follow rules

 He will walk in the middle of the road, but will not move left

 The angels will say go left

 Sadha, the soul is immortal
 sadak par durghatana main sirf deh marati he, aatma thode hi marati he
 Why should the learned learn so much discipline for this frivolous body that they walk on the left side of the road? saadho, main to police kaa bhakt hum so fouran baayen baaju ho jaataa hum
 I'm a coward

 xxxthis is honestly one of the most adorable things that I've ever seen 🥰 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi prachand bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi kii he
 The exercise to form a new government has intensified
 vahiin, duusari ore bijepi sanghathan main pherbadal ke kadam uthaae jane hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has reached Parliament by winning the Lok Sabha elections for the first time and his term as party president has already been completed
 aise main ab agar shah ko duusari baar phir bijepi adhyaksh chunaa jayega yaa ve modi sarkaar main mantri banenge or koi doosraa netaa adhyaksh banegaa?bataa den ki 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh the
 Rajnath was relieved of the post of party president when he was given the responsibility of the home minister in the Modi government after coming to power at the Center with a strong majority
 iske baad bijepi adhyaksh ke taur par amit shah kii tajposhi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad hui thi
 In this way, Amit Shah completed the remaining two-year tenure of Rajnath
 iske baad janvari, 2016 main amit shah duusari baar bijepi ke adhyaksh bane
 Shah's full term of three years has been completed in January 2019 this year
 haalanki shah kaa kaarykaal puraa hone se pehle hi sitambar 2018 main party kii kaaryakarini kii baithak main sankalp liya gaya tha ki party 2014 chunaav se badi jeet hasil kar 2019 main satta main lautegi
 For this, Amit Shah will be the temporary president of the party till the Lok Sabha elections
 is tarah se shah kii aguwai main ab bijepi ne 2014 se bhi zyada siten 2019 main jitkar satta main vaapasi kii he
 The interesting thing is that according to the constitution of the BJP, a man can become the president of the party for the full term only twice
 haalanki amit shah ne pehla kaarykaal rajnath singh kaa hi puraa kiya tha
 So technically, he has completed only one term
 bataa den ki bijepi ke samvidhan ke mutabik party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh vahi vyakti ho saktaa he jo kam se kam 15 varshon tak party kaa sadsy rahaa ho
 Apart from this, the 'election' of the National President in the BJP is done by the electoral college, which consists of members of the National Council and members of the State Councils
 bijepi ke samvidhan main ye bhi likhaa he ki nirvaachak mandal main se koi bhi 20 sadsy rashtriya adhyaksh pad ke chunaav ladane vaale vyakti ke naam kaa sanyukt rup se prastaav kar sakate hai
 This joint resolution must come from at least five states where elections to the National Council have been completed
 saath hi saath namakan patr par ummidavaar kii sweekruti jarur honi chahie
 The crushing defeat of the Congress in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections is perhaps the deepest crisis ever for the 129-year-old party and a major challenge for the family carrying forward its legacy
 rabindranath tagore ne bhartiya swatantraaa sangram or bharat kii jo avadharana sabase pehle vyakt kii thi, uski drushti or viraasat khatre main he
 It is not that the Congress has been wiped out, but rather that the nature of the winner matters a lot
 aresas ke netritv vaali takaton kaa bhartiya rashtriya andolan se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 The RSS had also asked its cadre to stay away and conserve their energy for the 'real' fight even during the 'quit India' movement, the last boom of the freedom struggle
 unki asli ladaai kaa matlab musalamaanon ke khilaaf laduya tha
 The same forces were also responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 isi vajah se aaazaad bharat ke pehle grahamantri ne aresas ko pratibandhit kiya tha or uske 25,000 kaaryakartaaon ko jail main daal diya tha
 These forces have now taken over the power of the country with an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha
 to kya iskaa matlab yah hua ki hamaare rashtravaadi netaaon ne bharat kii jo avadharana gadhi thi, vah ab dam tod chuki he? ek-tihaai se bhi kam votaron (kareeb 31 fisadi) ne bijepi ko vot diya he
 Despite this, they got a large number of seats due to our 'whoever won the vote, the election system'
 is chunaav pranali main sudhaar kii sakht jarurat he
 But will the Congress be able to make full use of the capabilities of a large number of people who have not voted for the divisive image of the BJP and its right-wing agenda to reverse this situation? The answer to this question will depend on whether the Congress How accurately she is able to understand the reasons responsible for the unprecedented situation and can also examine the fact that the BJP is so big Why did
 uski vaapasi is par bhi nirbhar karegi ki vah bhavishya ke liye kisi spasht ranneeti banaati he
 We can start with a statement by veteran BJP leader LK Advani
 unhone kaha tha ki bijepi kii jeet congress ke kushasan, mahangaai rokane main sarkaar kii vifaltaa or narendra modi kii 'event management’ kii laajawab yogyata ke bal par is sthiti kaa phayda uthaae jane kaa nateeja he
 Some other factors can also be added to these reasons responsible for the defeat of Congress and the rise of BJP
 pehla, bijepi ne uttar pradesh, pashchim bengal, assam or gujarat jaise bade rajyon main hindu voton kaa joardaar dhruvikaran kiya
 Second, the successful promotion of the right-wing economic agenda in the Indian corporate world in such a way that they decided to give their full support to a divisive communal alliance, almost unanimously for the first time in Indian history, to support Modi
 germany main vyapaaree or kuleen varg ne bhi adolf hitler ko satta main pahunchane ke liye isi tarah kaa samarthan diya tha
 The corporate world of the country gave this cooperation only to fulfill their dreams
 korporate jagat ke sapanom main paryaavaran or karodon garib bharatiyon ke saamaajik, loktantric sarokaaron ko kahin jagah nahin di gai
 The acquisition of the Land Acquisition Bill has become out of tolerance for the corporate world in a series of rights-based laws recently passed by Congress
 do dashakon se zyada samay tak korporate jagat ke dulaare rah chuke manmohan singh ekaek asweekaarya ho gaye, kyonki unhen korporate varg ko tarah-tarah ke ghotaalon ke jariye phayda pahunchane or prakritik sansadhano par kabja dilaane main aksham vyakti ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Third, the Congress campaigned without enthusiasm and without leadership
 desh ke ek bade hisse main unhen takkar dene vaali party ke taur par bhi nahin dekha gaya
 Even in a strong Congress-based state like Rajasthan, she did not appear in the election arena with stamina
 ek baat yaad rakhni chahie ki jin rajyon main kshetreey dalon ne modi ko jamkar takkar di, vahaan modi kii tsunami nadaarad ho gai
 For example, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Telangana
 yahaan tak ki congress ne bhi punjab jaise rajya main itnaa kharaab pradarshan nahin kiya kyonki vahaan usne aage badhkar muqabla kiya, jisaki vajah se bijepi ke star netaa ko bhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Fourth, the scattering of partnership between the party and the government
 yah bhagidaari upie-1 ke samay or upie-2 main kuch samay ke liye bahut acchhee tarah barkaraar thi
 Due to this disintegration, the government completely disappeared and in the last two years, there was a perception of complete destruction
 'kamjor’ yaa 'anishchaypurna netritv’ ko is shoonyata kii vajah mana gaya
 Modi was seen as a 'strong' and 'messianic' leader to fill this empty space
 aakhri or shaayad sabase ahm vajah yah thi ki congress vikaas karne or prabhavi dhang se vitaran karne main apni safalataa kaa prachaar karne main vifal rahi
 It seemed as if one section of the Congress (mainly associated with the Prime Minister) considered itself responsible for development and another section (mainly associated with Sonia Gandhi) considered itself beneficial to the poorer section of the society
 maje kii baat yah he ki donon hi ek-duusare kii safalataa ko nakaarne ke taur par dekhe gaye
 Even after running the program of providing such a rate of growth to India and employing the poor (which is one of the biggest poverty alleviation programs in the world), the growth rate which could not be thought of till a few decades ago The Congress failed to take credit for any one
 koun yakeen karegaa ki yahi vah party thi, jisane apni saarvbhaumikta se samjhauta kiye bina bharat ko vaishvikaran ke daur main pahunchaaya
 At the same time, the interest of the poor was also preserved
 yah kaam kisi or desh ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 What Congress needs to do now in future
 pehla, ise ek majboot or patibaddh netritv khadaa karne kii jarurat he
 a leadership who deeply understands the ideology of the Congress and has been engaged in this endeavor for a long time
 congress ko akasar anya logon kii raajnneeti karne kii salaah dene vaale or ek gaiyr-rajnatik gut kii salaah par aadhe-adhure man se kaam karne vaale netaa party kaa bhala nahin kar sakate
 This group has been advising to promote Hindutva in the name of not hurting the sentiments of the majority and sometimes promoting minority communalism and caste politics in the name of upliftment of the underprivileged
 aisa karne se jativaadee or sampradayik log duusare dalon (mayawati, mulaayam singh yadav or bijepi) ke saath chale jate hai
 Because of this kind of politics, Modi gets the benefit of the opposite effect and starts claiming equal conduct with all the citizens of the country
 congress ko indira gandhi ke jamaane ke us naare ko yaad karnaa chahie, jisamen kaha gaya tha— ''na jaat par, na paant par, indira ji kii baat par, mohar lagegi haath par
 "the Congress should continue on its left-leaning, fully secular and inclusive path (without promoting racist and communal politics)
 vah rasta jo ek sadi se is party kii visheshta rahaa hai
 a more important need is that the Congress should seriously try to restore its democratic character, like Mahatma Gandhi reorganized the party in 1920 and this work continued till the 1960s
 rajeev gandhi or rahul gandhi ne baar-baar party main khulaapan laane, jamini str par sampark banane or 'satta ke dallalon’ ko darkinar karne kii baat kii
 He also took some small steps, but these efforts were lost somewhere in the immediate concern of ruling the country
 ab ise apana mukhya mudda mudda banane kaa mauka he
 Let us not forget that the forces that the Congress had built through the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution have created an army of three million elected representatives at various levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions
 hamaare loktantr ko majboot banane ke liye jamini str par is urja kaa upyog karnaa hoga
 The Congress should once again undertake a massive campaign to increase membership and allow its members to elect officials from village to taluka, district, province and national level
 isamen eisisi, kaaryakari samiti or party adhyaksh kaa chunaav bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Even the biggest leaders of the Congress like Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose had to face elections for various positions and sometimes even had to face tough competition
 is kaam main farji sadsyta jaisi kuch vyaavhaarik samasyaayein aaengi, lekin congress ko in chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa hi hoga
 j em
 Clean elections should be held in the party with the support of veterans like Lyngdoh
 aaj ke samay main yah koi badi samasya nahin he
 If the Congress succeeds in this task, it will once again be the only party in the country which will have internal democracy
 yah desh kii duusari partiyon ke liye ek misaal ban sakati he
 If the Congress is able to do so, it will be able to avoid all the criticisms like doing politics of dynasty, closing the door for the underprivileged, getting away from the people and giving opportunities to the sycophants
 congress ko ek baar phir khud ko uddeshypurna or ek nishchit drushti vaali party ke taur pesh karne kii jarurat he, na ki aisi party jo sirf satta kii bhukhi he, jaisi vah dinodin hoti ja rahi he
 In this endeavor, the party will have to work with humility and wholeheartedly support the individuals, groups and organizations who agree with the views expressed by its veteran leaders about India

 ek shaatir chor dilli police ke hathe chadha he
 It wears a gold ring in each finger
 mahangi lagjri kaaron main baithkar chori karne vaala yah chor farrotedaar angreji bhi bolta he
 Fond of branded clothes, this thief opens any locks in a few minutes with his hands and a special device
 dilli main aisa hi chor kuch saal pehle bhi pakadaa gaya tha
 The name was Bunty
 banty ke karnaamon par bollywood main ek film ‘oy lakki, lakki oy’ bhi bani thi
 Bunty is currently behind bars in jail, but for the last few days, another person had been beheaded by police on the lines of Bunty
 yah chor yani sanjay pahadiya ab police ke hathe chadha he
 However, Sanjay's exploits are two steps ahead of Bunty
 darasal south dilli ke hyprophile ilaakon main pichley kai dinon se choriyaan ho rahi thi
 a thief was executing these incidents very cleanly
 dilli police ne is chor ko pakadaney ke liye apane tej tarraar afasaron ke saath special cell ko laga diya
 But this thief was so vicious that he did not leave any trace after the incident
 chori se pehle wo ghar ke andar or baahar lage sisitivi camere bhi band kar detaa tha
 How did he get caught? However, during a robbery at Sarita Vihar, he made a mistake and his picture was captured in the CCTV camera
 saath hi police is chor kii car main ek monitering divaais lagane main kaamyaab ho gai jiske baad yah police ke hathe chadh gaya
 When Delhi Police caught Sanjay, at that time he was doing Ayyashi with his girlfriend in a luxurious hotel in Surajkund

 When people leave the house to go to work, then they also have their eyes on the environment of the country
 aajkal ikkaa-dukka bache aise akhbaaron ko bhi log dekh lete hai, jo desh ke vaastavik halaat bataane se baaj nahin aate
 Some TV channels also keep from the travesty of the athletes
 yani aisa nahin he ki hakeekat der tak chhipi rah sake - chaahe khud kii ho, chaahe desh kii, derasber mali haalat khud bhi bolne lagati he
 In Bhagalpur, there are new revelations in the case of illegal withdrawal of crores of rupees from government account
 ab tak kii jaanch main jo baat saamne ai he vah yah he ki 'srijan' ek gaiyr sarkari sanstha he, jo jile main mahilaon ke vikaas ke liye kaary karti thi, asal main is sanstha kaa mukhya dhandha karodon kaa gorakhdhandha tha
 With the connivance of banks, this institution made illegal withdrawals of more than Rs 300 crore from the government deposit account
 shuukravaar ko 'aaj tak'bhagalpurke sabor block main pahunchaa, jahaan par 'srijan' kaa mukhya daftar tha
 Although this office has been sealed by the Economic Offenses Wing, which is investigating this entire racket, but the 'aaj Tak' team went inside this office and found that it is here to empower women and provide jobs
 Papad, spices, saris and handloom clothes were made by this institution
 is daftar main paae gaye masaale or papad sabhi 'srijan' brands se bazaar main beche jate the
 The crores of scam will come out
 Now it has become clear that the business of making papad and spices was only to mislead the world and in fact the illegal work of illegal withdrawal of crores of rupees from the government treasury was the main task
 jaanch main yah baat saamne ai he ki ab tak 300 karod rupee se zyada jo is sanstha ne sarkari khajaane se avaidh rup se nikaale the
 Invested this money in the market, as well as in real estate
 in paison se logon ko 16% byaaj dar par lone bhi muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 Giving information about illegal withdrawal 'till today' in two ways, Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said that this institution used to do illegal extraction from this entire government treasury in two ways
 ek tarika tha swip mod or doosraa tha check mod
 Through the swipe mode, huge amounts were deposited by the state government or central government in the government accounts of Bhagalpur district
 swip mod main rajya sarkaar yaa centre sarkaar ek patr ke madhyam se bank ko suchit karti thi ki kitni raashi bank main jamaa kara di gai he
 Bank officials were also involved in this whole racket
 vahasarkarikhate main is paise ko jamaa nahin dikhaakar 'srijan' ke khate main is puure paise ko jamaa kar diya karte the
 The second way was the check mode, where whatever money the state government or central government had to deposit in the government accounts of Bhagalpur district, it was done through check
 ek baar sarkari khate main check jamaa ho jaataa tha to phir jiladhikari ke daftar main shaamil kuch log jo ki is gorakhdhandhe main hissaa the, jiladhikari ke farji hastakshar se agle din vahi raashi 'srijan' ke acount main jamaa kara diya karte the
 The mastermind of Gorakhndhe was Manorama Devi Gaur, saying that so far 7 people have been arrested and 5 firs have also been filed in this whole case
 'srijan' ke sansthaapak manorama devi ke putr or bahu, amit kumaar or beti priya kumaar philhal faraar chal rahe hai or police unako giraftaar karne ke liye dabish de rahi he
 Manorama Devi, who was the mastermind of this entire gorakhandha, died in February this year

 The Delhi High Court on Tuesday dismissed the petition challenging the decision of the lower court of Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-sikh riots case
 nichali adaalat ke faisle main kumaar par yahaan sultanpuri ilaake main chah logon kii hatya ke maamle main aarope tay kiye jane kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 Judge Suresh Kait dismissed the plea of kumar accused of inciting rioting, murder and destruction of property and ordered a hearing against him
 tippaniyan Kumar had challenged the order of the lower court in which charges were framed in July 2010, including five accused, in connection with the murder of six people after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984

 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar bihar main janata dal (you) or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke bich siton ke bantwaare ko lekar rassakashi kaa daur ek maheene ke bheetar khatm ho saktaa he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that after the meeting between him and BJP President Amit Shah last week, the proposal will come from the BJP in the next three-four weeks
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke bich do baar mulaakaat hui thi
 In which there was a long discussion about the coordination of seats
 ab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki agle kuch hafton main siton ko lekar bijepi kii taraf se prastaav aayega
 Regarding which things will be clearly revealed to the public
 jedy(you) ko barabari kaa darja de sakati he bhaajapahalanki rajnatik galiyaaron main is baat ko lekar charchaa joro par he ki aakhir bijepi kya prastaav degi? 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bade bhai kaa darja praapt jedy(you) ko lekar kayaas lagaae ja rahen he ki bijepi, jedy(you) ko barabari kaa darja de sakati he
 Because BJP knows that JD (U) may not win the elections alone, but the face of Nitish Kumar will make a big difference to the alliance
 yah baat 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sabit bhi ho chuki he
 It is believed that BJP and JD (U) can contest 16-16 seats
 jabaki baaki siton main 6 par ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party (lojpa) or 2 par upendra kushvaha kii party chunaav lade
 The constituents will get respectable positions
 It is also being speculated that BJP can contest 19 seats while JD (U) will get 13 seats
 yah tab sambhav ho paaegaa jab donon partiyon main is baat ko lekar sahmati ban jaae ki vidhansabha ke chunaavon main jedy(you) ko zyada siton par chunaav ladane kaa mauka mili
 The JD (U) has only 2 seats in the current Lok Sabha
 vahi bihar se bijepi ke 22 saansad hai
 It is believed that some honorable proposal will come from BJP for JDU
 kyonki amit shah ne guuruuvaar ko hi apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki ham apane gathbandhan main shaamil ghatak dalon kaa khyaal rakhana jaanate hai
 The rage on the elder brother and younger brother is over! Now, how much BJP takes care of Nitish Kumar, everyone's eyes are on it
 haalanki jedy(you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar va bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke bich guuruuvaar ko mulaakaat ke baad donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich bayaanbaji bilkul band ho gai he
 Even this dispute is over who will be the elder brother and who will be the younger brother? Now wait, what proposal does BJP bring for JDU on its behalf? teen din ke baad ganatantr diwas he or puure desh main aatankwaadiyon ko lekar alert jari he
 But terrorist organizations are also not sitting quietly
 ve desh ke naujavaanon ko gumraah karne kii apni napak sajeesh main lage hue hai
 And now these terrorists are sending messages on their mobiles to mislead the youth
 aatankwaadiyon kii is nai sajeesh kaa khulaasa noida se hua, jahaan ek noujvaan isi tarah kaa massej aane ke baad police main shikaayat darj karaane pahunchagaya
 According to the complaint lodged, a message came on the youngster's mobile to join the terrorist organization of Osama bin Laden
 massej main aage likhaa he, "osama bin laden khudaahai
 Become a terrorist for Jihad
 " shikaayat darj hone ke baad police ko ashanka he ki na jane desh ke kitne naujavaanon ko is tarah kaa massej bheja ja rahaa ho
 Shailendra Sharma, a resident of Noida, has been receiving such messages continuously since January 10
 pehle to shailendra ne massej ko ignor kiya, lekin massej lagaataar aata rahaa
 But in view of the alert of terrorist attack in view of 26 January, Shailendra filed a complaint at Sector-24 police station
 police ne bhi maamle kii gambhirtha ko samajha or turant FIR darj kar lee
 The police also informed the intelligence agencies in this regard
 isse pehle bhi soshal site ke jariye iesai kii taraf se desh ke naujavaanon ko aatanki sanghathan main shaamil hone ke liye bargalane ke maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 But when the Indian government started taking strict measures regarding the content of social sites, now the terrorists have taken out this new method to trick the youth of the country
 kyonki zyaadaatar aatankwaadi unheen naujavaanon ko apana nishaanaa banaate hai, jo zyada padhe likhe nahin hote yaa phir berozegaar hote hai
 Therefore, it cannot be denied that through text messages on mobiles, these terrorists are planning to create terrorists against the country itself
 police ab shailendra ko sabhi madhyamon se is tarah chemasej bhejne vaale logontak pahunchane kii koshish main jute gai he
 The police will also investigate what is the intention of the sender and what is the purpose of the sender

 Shashi's father (47) Akhilesh Kumar Gaur studies till 12th and he earns Rs 400 every day by plastering the walls
 shashi kii maa kabhi skool nahin gayin
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier announced that a resident of the national capital has decided to bear the expenses of the education of Vijay Kumar, who secured his seat at IIT Delhi by taking advantage of the free coaching scheme

 Earlier only talented dalit students could get the facility of free coaching
 lekin sarkaar ne haal main iske daayre main pichde evam saamaanya shrenee se aane vaale aarthik rup se kamjor chaatro ko bhi shaamil kiya he

 mark spitz ne ye karishma 1972 main munich olympic main kiya tha
 The government put a stop to Wednesday on speculation about the demonetisation of 2000 rupee notes and said additional security measures have been put in place to control the problem of counterfeit notes
 grih rajya mantri kiran rijiju ne rajyasabha main kaha ki is sambandh main chal rahi afvaahon par zyada dhyaan nahin diya janaa chahie
 It is worth mentioning that Madhusudan Mistry of Congress had questioned in the Question Hour that there is speculation in the market that 2000 rupee notes can also be closed
 is par rijiju ne kaha, aisi afvaahon par mat jaaie
 The rumors should not be ignored
 unhone kaha ki nakli note baraamad kiye jane ke zyaadaatar maamle gujarat or pashchim bengal se aae hai
 He said that it is not correct to say that the notes cannot be identified
 rijiju ne kaha ki nae noton main suraksha ke kai nae upaay kiye gaye hai
 He said that he can assure the House that it is not possible to copy 100 percent of the new notes
 unhone kaha ki suraksha ke liye swadeshi digaayan ke alaava atirikt upaay bhi kiye gaye hai
 He said that the government is vigilant about fake notes and strict punishment provisions have been made in such cases
 unhone kaha ki aise maamalon ko lekar vibhinn khufia agency ke bich samanvay par jor diya gaya he tathaa logon ke liye prashikshan evanjagrukta kaarykramshuru kiya gaya he
 He said that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) recovered 22,677 notes of 2000 rupees from Gujarat and West Bengal
 subramanyam jaishankar ko desh kaa nayaa videsh mantri banaaya gaya he
 The immediate challenge before him will be to balance relations with the US and Iran and deal with China's growing influence in India's neighboring countries
 janvari 2015 se lekar janvari 2018 tak videsh sachiv rahete hue unhone modi ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan unki videsh niti ko aakaar dene main ahm bhoomika nibhaai, jiske chalate pramukh deshon khaskar america or arab deshon ke saath bharat ke sambandh ko mahatvapurn vikaas vistaar mila
 He was India's Ambassador to the US since 2013 before becoming the Foreign Secretary
 is dauraan unhone america prashasan or modi sarkaar ko kareeb laane main badi bhoomika nibhaai
 It is believed that PM Modi was impressed by his work
 ab videsh mantri ke rup main unke saamne kai chunautiyaan hongi
 According to Indian Express, India wants to play a leadership role on international forums like G20, SCO, BRICS, indo-asean, india-africa Forum
 iske liye nae videsh mantri ko kaaphi mehnat kerani hogi or in sabhi sanghathanon main bharat ke hiton kii raksha kerani pramukh chunauti hogi
 PM Modi himself is very active in building relationships with different countries of the world, in such a situation, s Jaishankar as foreign minister will always have to keep his waist tight and he will not have a chance to relax
 padosi deshon se rishtepakistan ke maamle main bharat ke liye ab bhi yah chunauti he ki kis tarah se aatankwaad or baatcheet saath-saath na hone ke apane rukh par kaayam rahete hue usase rishton ko saamaanya banaaya jaae
 In addition, there is the challenge of strengthening ties with BIMSTEC countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, where China has already gained influence
 china kii chunautihamaare pados main china jaisaa desh he jo apni aakraamak samrik niti kii vajah se hameshaa mushkil khadaa karata rahaa he
 We have many unresolved issues with China
 nae videsh mantri ko piemo or anya pramukh agenciyon ke saath samanvay banaakar china ke saath rishton ke maamle main samekit prayaas karnaa hoga
 This ability cannot be doubted given s Jaishankar's role in resolving the Doklam dispute
 madhya purv ke deshon kii jatiltakhadi deshon se rishton ke maamle main bharat ne apane paanv majbootee se jamaa liye hai
 About 8 million Indians live and work in the Middle East
 tel-gas yani bharat kii urja suraksha ke lihaaj se yah kshetra kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 But it is also very difficult for India to handle this relationship due to the mutual disharmony of the countries of the region and their relationship with Pakistan
 america or ruthemerica ke saath hamaare rishte kaaphi majboot hai
 But there are many issues on the H1B visa and business front
 iran or tarriff ke kai masalon par america se rishte thode bigade bhi, lekin abhi ise saamaanya hi kaha ja saktaa he
 India is now engaged in strengthening its relations with Russia in the fields of defense, nuclear power and space
 haalanki ek bade sainya sajo-saamaan ayatak hone ke naate isse duuri america bhi nahin chahega

 It is special that the producer also welcomed my decision
 ' shaayad yah baat aapako pataa hogi ki kuch saal pehle tak in dinon ke prem ke kisse khub popular hua karte the, or nitu ko apane deshi andaaj ke liye janaa jaataa he

 It is a matter of great surprise that if a team loses 5 out of its 6 matches, the situation becomes such that if one match is lost then it is out of the tournament
 jaraa sochie ki team ke khilaadiyon ko ponting ne koun si ghutti pilaai hogi ki kisi ne hausala nahin haara
 It is said that a coach is as good as his team
 lekin is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kabhi kabhi coach kii bhoomika se bhi team ke bhagya kaa faisla ho jaataa he
 Rohit Sharma also admits that Ricky Ponting has enhanced his captaincy, which makes him easy to move forward with the team
 ponting ke tricks rohit or team ke liye kaaphi laabhadaayak rahe
 After winning the IPL, Ponting said in the style of a Bollywood hero, 'I already said, i have come here to win
 ' or shaayad isi ek line ne is baat ko bhi bayaan kar diya ki riki ponting kis bhalaa kaa naam he

 yah muqabla shaam 7 baje se khelaa jayega
 Dhoni had dropped the catch of Shahid Afridi, Nehra had abused him
 
 If you look at the current form of Team India, winning the ODI series against New Zealand, then the host team seems to have the upper hand
 lekin khel ke is praaroop main kiviyon ne hameshaa bharat ko shikast di he
 The Indian team has never been able to win a T20 match over New Zealand, including the T20 World Cup and other series

 i have come to cast my vote before writing this article
 usee skool main jahaan maine pehali baar 1977 vaale aam chunaav main vot daalaa tha indira gandhi ko haraane ke liye
 What was the election, what was the atmosphere, what was the desire in the heart! Not just in my heart, but in everyone's heart because it was to defeat a dictator who had taken away our basic rights
 is baar usee skool kii taraf jab gai to dekha ki gali tivi waalon kii gadiyon se khachaakhach bhari hui thi
 Little surprised
 phir yaad aayaa ki jis skool main meraa matdaan centre he vah rahul gandhi ke ghar se do kadam hi dur he
 
 
 This Majma of the media people was waiting for him
 agar 1977 ke chunaav kii khalanayika thi unki daadi, to 2009 ke is aam chunaav ke hero rahe hai rahul baba
 They have become such a big hero that it is no longer appropriate to say Rahul Baba
 ab to bhavi pradhanmantri kahana hoga shaayad or yah bhi swikaarna padegaa ki anya loktantric yuvaraajon se to achche hai
 At least at the national level, political issues are talked about, work properly
 unki raajnneeti kaa aadhaar na jatvaad he, na majahab
 Someone can compete with them only their younger sisters and she speaks Hindi only because she is good, and meets face-grandmother
 ek aise desh main jahaan aam janata ab bhi maanati he ki raaj agar kisi ne kiya he to sirf indira gandhi ne, unke 'karishma' se he unki pota-potee kaa aakarshan
 i got a little disappointed when this idea came
 yaad aayaa ki agar bharat kii ginati sabase garib deshon main aaj bhi he to dosha sabase zyada he indira gandhi kaa, jinhone raaj kiya 'garibi hataao' jaise jhuthe naaron ke sahare
 Those who put right economic and political policies, Apna Charisma, Apna Family
 unhone desh ke sabase puraane raajnneetik dal ko ek nijee company main parivartit kar daalaa
 This clever political trick was named 'qurbani'
 chaal itani kaamyaab rahi he ki rahul-priyanka aaj bhi baaten karte hai apane parivaar kii 'kurabaniyon' kii
 Is it sacrificial to consider India as our own personal property? Well, Kasur is ours too
 ham jaanate hai ki bharat main asli pragati pichley 15 varshon main hi hui he
 And that progress would not have been possible if economic reforms had not been done during Narasimha Rao
 in sudhaaron ke kaaran desh thodaa sampann hua kyonki arthvyavastha kii vaarshik vruddhi tiguni-chauguni ho gai
 Had we not abolished the license raj, we would have made this poor country even worse because as long as the nehru-gandhi family ruled, the annual growth rate of the economy never went above 3 percent
 jo log aaj bhi kehete hai ki aarthik sudhaaron kaa laabh sirf bade udyogpatiyon ko hua he, ve shaayad samajhe nahin hai ki desh main agar nijee niveshkon kaa paisa na aata to sadaken nahin banatin, bijli kii paidaavaar nahin badhati, skool-aspataal na ban sakate or in sab chizon kii jarurat garibon ko he, amiron se zyada
 Wealthy Indians do not need government electricity or water, nor a government school-hospital
 in janasevaon main behatari kaa laabh sirf garibon ko miltaa he
 Today the situation is that even middle class Indians are able to buy private services
 madhyavarg kii baat ai to yaad aayaa ki 1977 main madhyavargeey bhartiya itane thode the ki na hone ke baraabar
 Today, if more than 30 crore Indians are counted in the middle class, then due to the same economic reforms which had overturned the 'socialist' economic policies of Indira Gandhi
 agar kuch nahin mila hamako nehru-gandhi parivaar kii puja karne se, to kyon aaj bhi is parivaar kaa asar itnaa zyada he? kyon rahul gandhi ko itani aasaani se ham desh ke bhavi pradhanmantri ke rup main dekh sakate hai? is sawaal kaa jawaab dena chahie un virdohi dalon ko, jo aaj tak ek aise raajnneetik dal kaa virodh nahin kar paae hai jo ek parivaar kii nijee company ban kar rah gai he
 What is the answer to the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is today the largest opposition party? Why has she not been able to compete with Congress till date? Why could not a nation have such a leader who can end the familial democracy? Is it not true that if the Bharatiya Janata Party had given more attention to the real political issues except the temple-mosque issues, it would not Happen? The common man has tried to find an alternative to the dynastic Congress party on his behalf
 isse hi sabit hoti he yah baat ki 1989 ke baad kisi raajnneetik dal ko puraa bahumat nahin mila he loksabhaa main
