 jahaan health kii sari suvidhaayen hon auki vahaan technology se kaam hota ho
 The second is to promote preventive health whether it is in the name of yoga or in some other form

 Another aspect is that such a system be provided to a family, under which the government will pay the expenses of sickness up to five lakh rupees in a year
 iske kaaran garib kii jindagi main jo sankat aata he usase mukti milegi
 Secondly, this scheme will create a good network of private hospitals

 The Sports Ministry ordered its sexual harassment committee to investigate these allegations
 lekin in aaropon ke baad pad se istipha dene vaale kowshik ne haaki india par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki khel sanstha unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin hone ke baavjood unhen fansaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Kaushik resigned after hockey player Ranjitha Devi recently complained about sexual harassment to Hockey India during a tour of Canada and China

 "the Ministry has ordered its sexual harassment committee to investigate the recent allegations against MK Kaushik," the ministry said in a statement
 samiti us puri prakriya ko apnayegi jo mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne vishakha maamle main nirdhaarit kii thi
 The ministry also said that the committee will also look into the report of the panel of Hockey India which was set up by the institution to investigate the allegations against Kaushik
 mantralay ko haalanki abhi isaki report nahin mili he
 The statement said, "the report of the Hockey India inquiry committee is yet to be received by the ministry and the committee will also consider it
" ’samiti main khel mantralay kii paanch senior mahila adhikari or enjio kii ek mahila sadsy shaamil hogi
 The committee will elect one member from the Delhi Women's Commission
 is bich kowshik ne apane khilaaf police or sarkari karrwai kii sifarish karne ke haaki india ke adhikaar par sawaal uthaaya
 He objected that Hockey India admitted without verifying the allegations that Ranjita Devi's complaint against him was 'credible'
 unhone kaha ki paanch sadasyeey jaanch samiti kii report main keval tathy the or koi sifarish nahin kii gai thi isliye haaki india unke khilaaf karrwai kii sifarish nahin kar saktaa
 Kaushik said in a hastily called press conference, 'I object to Hockey India's decision not to use my services and recommend Delhi Police to take action against me
 jaanch samiti ne koi sifarish nahin kii thi to phir haaki india aisa kaise kar saktaa he
 "he asked," i object to Hockey India general secretary Narinder Batra's statement that Ranjita Devi's written reply was credible and specific allegations were made
 report main kaha gaya he ki aaropon ko koi satyaapan nahin kiya gaya
 So it is contradictory, on the one hand you are saying that its side is reliable and also that it is not proved
 aisa kaise sambhav he
 "in front of the media, presenting his lawyers Mandira Mitra and Praveen Aggarwal, Kaushik said," i am again saying that all these allegations against me are baseless and fabricated
 haaki india ne mere khilaaf karrwai kii sifarish kaa jo patr khel mantralay ko bheja he maine uskaa jawaab diya he
 Mitra said that his client would look at the situation for some time and then go to court if needed
 unhone kaha, ‘vah adaalat jaaenge yaa nahin yah kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 If needed, we will go to court, but first we are replying to Hockey India's letter to the government

 ) Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of Congress President after the Lok Sabha elections
 congress kareeb do maheene baad bhi rahul kaa vikalp nahin talash pai he
 There is confusion in the Congress party about this
 vahiin, priyanka gandhi lagaataar sakriy hai
 This is the reason why senior Congress leaders demanded Priyanka Gandhi to be the president, then Priyanka herself tweeted a tweet and said that she is in politics
 aise main congress main kuch sugabugahat dekhne ko mili rahi he, jinke sanketon se lagata he ki shaayad party kii kaman ab priyanka ke haathon main saunpi ja sakati he
 Many names like Ashok Gehlot, Sushil Kumar Shinde, Mallikarjun Kharge, Mukul Wasnik have been speculated for the new president of Congress, replacing Jutterahul Gandhi in making senior Congress leader Priyanka as president, but did not make a result
 aise main ho rahi deree ke bich congress ke kuch netaaon ne priyanka gandhi ko party adhyaksh banane kii maang kii he
 For this, leaders have started preparing roles within and outside the party
 congress ke in varisht netaa ko lagata he ki congress main rahul kii jagah lene ke liye priyanka se behatar koi vikalp nahin he
 However, Rahul Gandhi himself has made it clear that the next president of the party will not be from the Gandhi family
 iske baavjood yah maang isliye uth rahi he, kyonki priyanka gandhi ke netritv ko lekar congress netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko kaaphi ummiden hai
 Priyanka did not leave after the defeat, Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of Congress President, taking responsibility for the defeat of the Lok Sabha election
 iske baad congress ke kai pradesh adhyaksh or kai netaaon ne apane-apane padon se istipha de diya he
 Not only this, Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was made general secretary with Priyanka Gandhi and in-charge of Western UP, also resigned from his post
 lekin priyanka ne apana pad nahin choda
 While the Congress got just one seat in Priyanka's eastern Uttar Pradesh, the party leaders' bail was forfeited on the remaining seats
 congress ko mili karaari haar ke baad bhi priyanka ab tak apane pad par bani hui hai
 Priyanka Congress leader is completely inactive after continuous Lok Sabha election results
 jabaki priyanka gandhi lagaataar sakriy he
 The party is constantly churning with leaders and workers to defeat UP
 iske alaava vah party ke bhitarghaat karne vaale netaaon kii talash main bhi juty he
 At the same time, for the last few days, Priyanka has been attacking fiercely on the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh
 ise uttar pradesh ke 12 vidhansabha siton par hone upachunaav ke saath-saath 2022 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Tweeting on entry into politics, Priyanka Gandhi has spoken about her political entry while sharing an old picture on the occasion of Nelson Mandela's birth anniversary
 priyanka ne twit kar kaha he, 'mandela ne kaha tha ki mujhe raajnneeti main hona chahie
 The world feels the lack of individuals like Nelson Mandela today more than ever
 unka jivan satya, prem or aazaadee kii misaal he
 'through this, Priyanka wants to say clearly that her political ability Nelson Mandela was recognized in 2001
 iske jariye ve bada raajnneetik sandesh dena chaahati hai
 Does the son also want Priyanka to become the Congress president? Does Priyanka Gandhi's son Rehan Vadra also want to see his mother as the Congress president
 yah sawaal isiilie uth rahaa he ki rehaan wadra ne apane fasebuk acount par ek news story share kii he, jisamen congress ke varisht netaa priyanka gandhi ko party adhyaksh banane kii baat kahi gai he
 Whereas till now, Rehan had not shared any such news
 yahi vajah he ki siyaasi galiyaaron main priyanka gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ke kayaas lagaae jane lage hai

 These include Vikas Marg, ITO, Rajghat, Aruna Asaf Ali Road and Maharaja Ranjit Singh Marg
 in raaston par kisaanon kii raily ke liye dur-dur se kisaanon ke jatthe pahuch rahe hai
 Along with these, the opening of the trade fair to the general public is also causing heavy jam

 Prashant Bhushan, who broke away from the Aam Aadmi Party, has now come forward openly against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 bhushan ne shanivaar ko subah-subah hi press conference kar kejariwal ke janalokapal bill ko mahajokapaal bataaya
 Earlier on Friday evening, tweeting Janlokpal was said to be breaking the principles which they had decided together
 prashanth bhushan ke mutabik dilli sarkaar apana lokapal bill somvaar ko sadan main pesh karne vaali he
 Delhi Lokpal bill trashes all principles of an Ind Janlokpal that we had drafted: Appt & removal not under govt; Ind Inv agency under Lokpal — Prashant Bhushan (@ pbhushan1) November 27, 2015 8 attacks on Kejriwal of Prashant 1
 anna kaa andolan swatantra lokapal ke liye tha
 Lokpal should be independent of the government
 aap us andolan se nikali jinhen swatantra lokapal laana tha, lekin kejariwal ke dilli janalokapal bill main wo aatma nahin he
 Kejriwal's bill is Mahajokpal
 2
 This government should have brought Janlokpal as soon as it arrived
 lekin saadhe nau maheene baadayah bilaaya
 He is also Mahajokpal
 hamen isaki ek copy bhi badi mushkil se mili
 Why was this bill kept secret like this? kejariwal ko ab istipha de dena chahie
 3
 tab ek drafting kamity bani
 We had 5 people in it, both Santosh Hegde, Kejriwal, Anna and us
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki lokapal ko hataane kaa adhikaar raajnneeti se jude logon ko nahin hoga
 But all was handed over to the government and leaders
 4
 There should be a recommendation of the committee of the Supreme Court to remove the Lokpal
 uttarakhand ke lokapal main bhi yahi tha ki sarkaar kaa sirf ek aadmi hoga
 But from the appointment to control and removal of this Lokpal, all is in the hands of the government
 5
 When the Aam Aadmi Party government was formed in 2014, the resignation was on the grounds that Jan Lokpal did not appear
 uskaa aadhaar sirf kejariwal ko pataa tha
 Lokpal passed in the cabinet, then we wrote a letter asking for Lokpal and asked to make it private
 6
 Now the Lokpal has been made such that it will remain in the government's possession
 chaar main se teen sarkaar ke log honge
 In this bill, the Lokpal has been empowered to be removed by a two-thirds majority
 7
 The bill brought that the Lokpal of Delhi will investigate the officer of the center
 yah praavdhaan isliye rakhaa gaya taaki centre ise paas hi na kare
 It will be stuck again
 kejariwal ke man main swatantra lokapal kaa iraadaa nahin tha
 8
 kejariwal kaa rukh ab badal gaya he
 Once we come to power then we will not allow accountability
 yah us andolan or logon ke saath dhokhaa he

 iske baad nikaay chunaavon main srinagar ke dalgate ward ke 15 ummidavaaron main shaamil mujammil jaan ne apana naam waapas le liya
 The terror of this incident was sustained in the first phase of the election ie till 8 October and only 8 out of the total 84,000 voters
 2 pratishat hi vot dene ko baahar nikle
 Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo has threatened to 'blind her by putting acid in the eyes of the candidates'
 aatankwaadiyon kii dhamkee ke alaava ghati ke donon pramukh dalon, ensi or piples democratic party (pidipi) ke chunaav ke bahishkaar ke kaaran bhi matdaan kaa pratishat kam rahaa
 Former minister Naeem Akhtar called it a "fraudulent election in which outsider candidates are being imposed on the people" and said that this would "undermine the confidence of the Indian state in the hearts of Kashmiris"
 '' pidipi ke varisht netaa kaa aarope he ki bhaajapa ghati main apni maujuudagi darj karaane ke liye in chunaavon kaa beja istemaal kar rahi he
 The BJP does not have a single assembly seat nor a Lok Sabha seat in the valley
 uskaa ghati main koi aadhaar hi nahin he isliye vah nagarpalika chunaavon kaa istemaal, pichley daravaaje se apni jagah banane ke liye kar rahi he
 By winning maximum seats in the civic elections in the Valley, the BJP is securing majority in seven municipalities in its first attempt
 aatankwaadiyon kii dhamkee or ensi-pidipi ke chunaavon ke bahishkaar kii badaulat bhaajapa ke 70 ummidavaaron ko nirvirodh nirvaachit ghoshit kiya jayega

 There will be no election in 244 of the 598 municipal wards of the valley as only one candidate has filed his nomination in these seats
 167 ward aise hai jahaan kisi ne parchaa nahin bharaa isliye in vaardon kaa koi pratinidhitiv nahin hoga
 The State Election Commission is planning to conduct 'by-elections' in these wards sometime in January after the panchayat elections
 ensi ke mahasachiv ali mohammad sagar ne ise 'jamhuriyat kaa majaak' bataaya
 The Valley was more keen on civic elections as the names of the candidates were not known to anyone, including voters
 aatankwaadi khataron ke kaaran bahut zyada gopneeyata barti gai or pratyaashiyon ne vot maangane ke liye koi prachaar nahin kiya
 At the same time, Akhtar says, "prime Minister Narendra Modi has also adopted the same old Congress structure without holding the valley, without participation of the valley?" 70 BJP candidates were elected unopposed in the valley because NC-PDP has boycotted —east Jolly and Moazzam Mohammed avaidh khanan par ai lokayukta kii report main purajor tareeke se karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa, reddy bandhuon or kai anya logon par aarope lagaaya gaya he or unke khilaaf bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium tathaa anya kanoonon ke tahat abhiyojan kii sifarish kii gayi he
 Pointing to the evidence against the Chief Minister, the Lokayukta, headed by former Supreme Court judge Santosh Hegde, said in its report that a mining company had donated Rs 10 crore to a trust run by the chief minister's family, which gave a mining company a plot was also sold for Rs 20 crore
 vishwaas nahin ki sarkaar report par karegi koi karrwiah santosh hegadoonulagnkon samet 25,228 pannon vaali apni report jamaa karte hue hegade ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki unhone khanan maamle main mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa, purv mukhyamantri tathaa jedies netaa ech di kumaraswami, reddy bandhu (rajya sarkaar main mantri or khanan udhyami), unke kuch sahyogiyon or ek anya mantri ech shriramulu, congress saansad anil laad kii patni tathaa 600 se adhik adhikariyon ke naam liye hai
 He said in the report that illegal mining between 2006 and 2010 caused a loss of Rs 16,085 crore to the exchequer
 mukhyamantri ke parijan dwaara sanchalit trust ko diye gayi daan ke sandarbh main hegade ne kaha, ‘bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium ke tahat aparaadh hone ke nattejey par pahunchane ke saath maine rajyapal se aage kii karrwai ke liye sifarish kii he
 'first Prime Minister, Home Minister Resign' on Telecom Issue: Yeddyurappa also said, 'I have recommended prosecution on every person
 maine rajyapal ko yah bataaya he
 Now they have to take action
 ’ ek sawaal ke jawaab main hegade ne fataak se jawaab diya, ‘bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium ke tahat karrwai honi chahie
 what else?' In the report, the ruling BJP government has been blamed for not being able to stop the irregularities and illegal activities in mining in the state since May 2008
 hegade kii mukhya report 943 pannon kii he
 He said, 'the investigation has revealed involvement of officers, administration and influential people both at the grassroots level
 ’ hegade ne kaha ki jaanch ke dauraan unhen pataa laga ki louh ayask ke vyapaar se judi ek company ne mukhyamantri ke parivaar ke sadasyon dwaara sanchalit trust ko 10 karod rupee daan kiye the
 Hegde said that a mining company suggested 1 acre of land from the trust
 40 karod rupee kii dar se kahin zyada 20 karod rupee main kharidi
 He said, 'this payment was made to the trust which had nothing to do with the donor company
 company kaa kaamkaaj acha nahin chal rahaa tha lekin usne ek anya company se dhan udhaar lekar trust ko daan diya
 It is very difficult for me to understand this unusual high price
 ’hegade ne kaha, ‘ham is nirvivaad nishkarsh par pahunche hai ki yah daan or bikri vaastavik kaarnon se pare anya vajahon ko sochakar kiye gayi
 He confirmed that the report named the Chief Minister, his family, Reddy brothers, Sriramulu, Kumaraswamy and more than 600 officials

 Hegde said that it is very difficult for him to assume that a company that does not have financial resources would have borrowed from other companies to donate
 hegade ne kaha, ‘isliye bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium ke tahat aparaadh hone ke nattejey par pahunchane ke saath hi maine rajyapal se is sambandh main (mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa ke khilaaf) aage kadam uthaane kii sifarish kii he kyonki mukhyamantri ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye samaksh praadhikaar pradesh ke rajyapal hai
 He said that the Lokayukta has submitted the report to the government and a copy of the report with attachments has been sent to the governor for further action
 reddy bandhu ke bare main hegade ne kaha ki karnataka main khanan nahin karne ke unke daawey ke vipareet tathyon ko sabit karne ke liye paryaapt dastavej hai
 He said that different types of irregularities have been found and there are documents in his support
 hegade ne kaha, ‘anek logon or companiyon dwaara kiye gayi aparaadhon ko anek kanoonon ke daayre main laayaa jayega or bhartiya dand samhita, van adhinium, ebbemardie tathaa bhrashtachar rokthaam adhinium ke anuroop karrwai kii jaaegi
 He said that the Lokayukta had recommended that the government should revoke the mining license, calculate the loss and recover the money at the market price from the people concerned, considering it a 'stolen iron ore'
 lokayukta kii jaanch main yah baat saamne ai he ki bellari, chitradurg or tumkur main teji se avaidh khanan hua jiske chalate sthaneey logon ne anek samasyaon kaa saamana kiya
 Describing more than 100 companies involved in illegal mining, Hegde said, "if illegal mining stops, the Central and State governments can get millions of crores of rupees from excise and VAT tax
 ’ hegade ne sarkaar se is baat kii bhi sifarish kii he ki lokayukta ke adhikariyon ke dal ko suraksha milani chahie kyonki unhen khatra ho saktaa he

 jisamen hajaaron kii sankhya main jawan ghayal hue

 5 Star Artist: Kangana Runot, R
 madhavan, deepak dobariyaal or swara bhaskaradiarector:anand el raay2011 main ek kangana najar ai thi lekin is baar do hai
 Flirtatious bindaas

 That means double the fun
 film'tanu vaids manu riterns'dekhakar yah kehane main ek second nahin lagata ki filmkanganake kandhon par he
 Then with the arrival of two Kangana, the attention is divided to a large extent from the story
 shaayad anand el raay is baat ko bakhubi samajhate the
 Therefore, he has kept the story very much like last time, just added a new character named Kusum Sangwan
 kai baaten khatkati hai, jaise jimi shergill or madhavan kii kismat kaa phir se takaraana
 Tanu's flirt with a rickshaw
 tanu kaa vahi purana andaaj
 a middle-aged man's college love with Kihriyanavikanya and a wild love story
 or bhi kaaphi kuch he lekin yah kusum or tanu hi hai, jo apane swaigar se film ko bakhubi aage dhakelti hai
 Overall, this is the story of Prem's post-wedding and Prem's ghost after marriage
 jise chutile sanvaadon or achche sangeet ke saath sajaayaa gaya he
 How much glory in the story begins with the marriage of Madhavan and Kangana (tanu)
 donon phir landan chale jate hai
 Bidhan begins to grow in conflict between Tanu and straight Manu
 donon manochikitsak ke paas jate hai or manu ko gusse kii vajah se paagalakhaane main daal diya jaataa he
 Kangana then returns
 manu bhi bharat aata he to yahaan uski mulaakaat kusum sangwan se hoti he jo tanu jaisi dikhti he
 The agony of old love awakens
 udhar, tanu phir se apni flert life jeene lagati he, phir use pataa chalata he ki manu kaa afaire chal rahaa he to kahani palat jaati he
 The work that Anand has been able to succeed in tying time through Kusum is because the story is average
 kusum tanu par baari padati he or vah everej kahani ko apni acting se bulandiyon par pahunchaa detii he
 Editing is tight
 uttar bharat or khaskar hariyaanvi andaaj film ko khaas banaate hai
 The kind of acting Kangana performs is an example for many Bollywood stars
 kangana everej kahani ko bhi apane andaaj se pankh laga detii hai
 It seems that Kusum and Tanu are two different human beings
 queen ke baad kangana kaa yah ek or yaadgaar role he
 Madhavan is right-handed
 lekin unhen thodaa apane wet par control karnaa chahie
 They say a lot with their grin and silence
 jimi shergill auraswara bhaskarabhi pehle jaise hi hai
 Deepak Dobriyal tickles
 kamai kii batisamen koi do raay nahin ki film ko lekar acha craij he, or kangana aise dheron maukey detii hai, jab sitiyaan bajati hai or haul main jamkar shor hota he
 While watching the film, if the mind finds someone, it is Kusum Sangwan
 dil ko jeet leti he
 She goes down to the depths and she tells that there is no one like her
 film kaa sangeet acha he
 There is also a wedding atmosphere
 uttar bhartiya conect bhi he
 Then its budget is about 50 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 The film is not going to be a loss deal as Kangana is keen to take it to the box office

 choudhary veerandra singh ko 22 akbar road kaa bangala janvari main aavantit to ho gaya, lekin wo vahaan jate kaise, kyonki vahaan to ab bhi ambika soni dati huin thi
 Ambika Soni first refused to vacate the house
 unki daleel thi ki rajyasabha ke saansad ke taur par vah is bangale kii hakdaar hai
 When she was given notice to vacate the bungalow, she went to court
 unke saath hi purv mantri kumari shailaja bhi court gayi, jo apane mantri vaala bangala khaali karne ko taiyaar nahin thim
 When the matter reached the High Court, the court strongly reprimanded both Ambika Soni and Kumari Selja
 yahi nahin, in donon par 25 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya
 But Ambika Soni and Kumari Selja did not give up and appealed against this decision in the High Court double bench
 ambika soni ne ab court se yah kaha ki ve 22 akbar road kaa bangala khaali karne ko taiyaar hai, lekin unhen ek dhang kaa ghar diya jaae
 The search for a new Type 7 bungalow now begins for Ambika Soni
 khoj khatm hui 84 lodhi astate ke bangale par, jisamen choudhary virendra singh rah rahe the
 But in the court, Ambika Soni's lawyer Kapil Sibal argued that till this house is vacated, how will they be able to see whether this house is worth their living or not
 22 number akbar road paane kii ummid main choudhary virendra sihan ne aanan-fanan main ye ghar khaali kar diya
 Virendra Singh had been living in this house for the last four years and was still in it after becoming a minister
 lekin ambika soni ne court ko kaha ki yah ghar rahane ke laayak nahin he
 At present, Chaudhary Virendra Singh is without a government house, as the bungalow at Akbar Road is not yet vacant and the bungalow at Lodhi Estate is being renovated to make it worthwhile for Ambika Soni to live
 saat sitambar ko hoicourt kii dabl bench ne bhi apane faisle main yah kah diya he ki ambika soni or kumari shailaja maheene bhar ke bheetar mantri vaala bangala khaali kar den
 But Rural Development Minister Chaudhary Virendra Singh is afraid that he does not know whether he will get the magnificent bungalow of Akbar Road even after a month

 agar vah paise ko waapas bharat nahin laate to vyaktigat taur par court main pesh ho
 The bank association told the Supreme Court that it had transferred $ 40 million from the Diego deal to the children's account and maintained a trust
 SBI or duusare bainkon ne supreme court se maang kii or kaha ki maalya ne karnataka hoicourt ke aadesh kaa ulanghan kar diego deal se mili 40 million dollar ko bacchon ke acount main transfar kiya he
 Banks have sought to deposit US $ 40 million from the deal in the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Earlier, on the petition of Vijay Mallya, the court issued notice to the banks and sought reply

 Actually, on the court's order, Mallya had filed the details of his property overseas

 darasal court ke aadesh par maalya ne desh videshi apni sampatti kaa byoraa daakhil kiya tha

 Farmer suicides are not mere figures
 yah ek traasad samay se guzar rahi kisaanon kii jindagi kii charam pariniti he
 i have lived this terrible change in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra while working among farmers for a long time
 aaj jo vidarbha kapaas kii nakadi fasal ke chaupat ho jane yaa keemten gir jane se barabaad ho rahaa he, kabhi uskaa swaroop alag tha
 Till three decades ago, there was traditional farming and there was a better balance between crops
 lekin phir sarkaar hi nakadi fasalon kii niti lekar ai
 The government itself inclined farmers towards these crops
 lekin 1997 main jab se nakadi fasalon se sabsidi khatm hui, tab se kisaan puri tarah bazaar kii dayaa par aa gaye
 During the cultivation of cotton for such a long time, tremendous exploitation of ground water was allowed
 ab jameen ke andar pani nahin he or monsoon kharaab hone par varsha se bhi sinchai nahin ho paati he
 These things make the farmer in crisis
 lekin sankat tab or bad jaataa he jab kisaan bahut oonchi keemat par beej kharidta he or phir fasal kharaab ho jaati he
 Turmeric seed Rs 20,000
 kilo tak bik rahaa he or papite ke khaas kism ke beej kii prati kilogram keemat lakh ru
 Leaves above
 kisaan ye beej kharidne ke liye karj letaa he
 The situation in Maharashtra is that if 20 percent of the farmers have taken loans from banks, then 80 percent of the farmers have taken loans from moneylenders
 yahaan sahuukaar kaa matlab paaramparik pagadi lagaae or naak par chashma atkaaye vyakti se nahin he
 Relatives, government employees, teachers and policemen have all come into this business according to the time
 yah maharashtra kii samaantar gramin arthvyavastha jaisaa ho gaya he
 This is the reason that even if governments forgive the debt, it would not benefit large sections of farmers
 duusari samasya yah he ki kisaan aatmahatya ke 90 fisadi maamalon ko police or prashasan kisaan aatmahatya maanata hi nahin he, aise main kisaan ke khudakushi karne ke baad uskaa parivaar puri tarah sadak par aa jaataa he yaa rishtedaaron ke rahamo-karampar aa jaataa he
 As far as the package given by the Maharashtra government is concerned, nothing is going to happen
 isse pehle 2005, 2006, 2008 or 2009 main bhi kisaanon ke naam par baribharakam package die gaye, lekin inase kisaan aatmahatya rukne kii bajaae badi hi hai
 Because the original purpose of these packages was to give some people a chance to fill their pockets instead of taking away the misery of the farmers
 sarkaar ko sidhe kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar dena chahie
 After this, attention should be paid to restore the traditional way of crops in the village
 kisi bhi surat main 50 fisadi se adhik kisaan nakadi fasalon kii ore na jaaen or baaki kisaan dalhan, tilhan kii ore rukh karen
 Better health services should be provided to the farmers
 unke bacchon ko padhai ke behatar saadhan uplabdh karaae jaaen
 Prices of fertilizer and seeds should be controlled in such a way that the cost of the farmers does not increase much
 ye sari chijen suvyavasthit rup se lagu karne par kisaanon kii dasha main dhire-dhire lekin buniyadi sudhaar aayega
 Education and health may not be directly related to agriculture, but the expenditure on health has a great relation with farmer suicides
 food sicurity jaisi pahal ko amal main laayaa jaae
 This will not cause the farmer to die of hunger in the least drought or other critical situation
 lekin dekhne main yah aa rahaa he ki is tarah ke sakaaratmak sudhaar karne kii bajaae sarkaar sudhaar ke naam par kisaan virdohi nitiyon par chal detii he
 Basic measures are necessary to prevent farmer suicides
 isse bahut adhik bhavukta yaa bhaashanbaaji se nahin nibata ja saktaa

 ) har ladke ke jivan main aise pal aate hai jab use kisi ladki se sachhee mohabbat ho jaati he
 He feels that he wants to spend life with the same girl
 kai baar ladakon ko apni kareebi dost se bhi pyaar ho jaataa he
 Because she is a friend, the boys are afraid to speak her heart
 dar lagata he ki kahin dosti naa tut jaae
 If a girl falls in love with her friend, then there is the same fear in her mind
 jaaniye wo baaten jinhen notice kar aap samaj sakate hai ki dost ko aapse pyaar he ki nahin
 
 
 1- If she talks hesitantly about her old boyfriends
 aapse apni lav life discus karti he to aapako samaj janaa chahie ki aap uske liye ek dost se badhkar kuch nahin hai
 2- If your friend tells or introduces you about another girl or says that think about such and such girl then the meaning is clear
 vah aapaki parvaah to karti he lekin pyaar nahin karti
 These are 7 habits, then you will prove 'bad' husband! 3- Body language also clears a lot
 aapke haath pakadaney kaa tarika ho yaa phir aapke peeth thapthapaane kaa
 If she keeps a necessary distance from you then you should think before proposing to her
 4- agar aap use bulaate hai coffee ke liye or vah apane doston ko saath laati he to bos ye aapke liye achche sanket nahin hai
 5- If she calls her surname or uses words like bro and bud instead of loving your name, then you should think before giving heart
 shaadi ke bandhan main bandhane se pehle apane life partner se kar len ye jaruri baaten6- agar vah aapse koi madad lenaa pasand nahin karti masalan vah khud ko ghar se pick karwaane ke bajaay raste main kahin milanaa pasand karti he
 Or if Bill always tries to do 50-50, then you should understand that you are just friends for him
 nakad lenden ko hatotsahit karne ke liye kendriya mantrimandal ne buudhvaar ko card or digital bhugtan par adhibhaar, seva kar or suvidha shulk samaapt karne kaa faisla kiya he

 The fire in the forests of Uttarakhand has destroyed all the records of the past years
 uttarakhand main 4 may tak 3,500 hectare jangal chal chukaa he, jo pichley varshon kii tulana main kahin zyada he
 According to experts, the cause of the fire is pine leaves, which act as flammable substances

 Savita says, “uttarakhand usually gets rains three to four times in the month of April and the maximum temperature goes up to 35–36 ° C
 par is baar barish nahin hui or taapmaana main bhi achaanak teji se badhotaree hui
 In such a situation, friction in the pine needles (its leaves are needle-shaped) increased and this became the cause of the fire
 ”uttarakhand main kul kshetrafal kaa 64
 65% is forest area, of which 22% is dense forest
 yahaan wanon main chid kii taadaad sabase zyada hai
 The area of the state's forest cover is 34,000 square kilometers, of which the pine itself is about 17,000 square kilometers
 baaki hisse main banj, saal, shisham, buransh, kafal jaisi vibhinn prajatiyon ke ped hai
 Pine is the main tree species of the Himalayas
 duniya bhar main isaki 105 prajatiyaan hai
 The main center of pine in the Himalayas is considered to be Uttarakhand, where two species of pine are rip pine and blue pine

 Singh explains, "pine leaves contain a chemical called lignin, which makes them highly flammable and quickly caught fire
 is saal do karod ton se adhik chid kii pattiyaan jangalon main jamaa thim, jo kam nami or shushk mausam kii vajah se badhate paare ke saath dahakani shuru ho gayi or aag ne vikaraal rup le liya
 "in Himachal Pradesh also, 573 incidents of forest fires have taken place so far this year, in which 5,195 hectares of forest has been hit by the state
" logon kii dein he yah aag?dow
 Savita says, "there is a myth in Uttarakhand that the grass that grows after setting fire is more nutritious for the animals
 isliye kai maamalon main dekha gaya he ki sthaneey log hi jangal main aag laga dete hai
 Similarly, no Timber Mafia is being held responsible for the fire on 5 hectares of land in Gambhir Muglah and Bathoni villages of the border district of Rajouri in Jammu
 jammu-kashmir ke van mantri choudhary laal singh kehete hai, “darasal, garmiyon main jangalon main jo log pashuon ko charaane ke liye jate hai, adhiktar maamalon main aag ke peeche unka hi haath hota he
 However, they also say that no evidence has been found so far that we can file a case against such people
 darasal, jangalon main chid ke ped kii pattiyaan girane se nai ghaas tab tak nahin ugti, jab tak in pattiyon ko hataa nahin diya jaataa
 New grass can grow, so people set the leaves on fire
 van mantri ke mutabik, aag lagane kii duusari vajah april-june ke shushk mausam main pashu charaane vaale logon kaa jangal main bidi-cigarette phenk dena bhi he
 Sometimes in this season the pine leaves automatically catch fire
 laal singh kehete hai, “aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye sarkaar ko jangal main baad lagaani hogi or isamen kareeb 8,000 karod ru
 Spend will be spent
 ”vrikshon kii chotii tak pahunchi agek anumaan ke mutabik, uttarakhand main har saal chid kii 51 lakh ton pattiyaan jinhen pirul bhi kaha jaataa he, pedo se girakar jangalon main bich jaati hai
 They do not take off from the forest and also take time to disintegrate
 pichley chaar saal se yah pirul jangalon main hi jamaa rahaa
 This time it took the form of gunpowder due to less rain, less moisture and rising mercury, the result of which is in the form of terrible fire
 chid kii ati jvalansheel or amleey pravriti kii pattiyon kii vajah se har saal aag lagati he
 According to studies, Uttarakhand's average 1,000 hectares of forest is exposed to fire every year due to dry pine leaves
 bhartiya van surveykshan ke aankade bhi isaki pushti karte hai
 But this fire is extinguished at the ground level and there are very few cases of it reaching the peak of the trees, but this time the fire reached the peak of the trees, which is a matter of concern
 jangalon main bade paimaane par lagi aag kii vajah se pradooshan kaa str bhi bad gaya he
 Senior Scientist of Pollution Control Board in Himachal Pradesh, Dr
 manoj chouhan kehete hai, “may maah main jangalon main aksar aag lagati he
 Hence the pollution level increases in this month compared to April
 ” haalanki is saal to april main hi pradooshan kaa str bad gaya he
 Vineet Kumar, Member Secretary, Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board, says, "no details of how much air pollution levels have increased due to fire in the forests are available, but this is due to the data available with our centers for measuring SPM
 It is found that the amount of suspended periculate in the air is higher than normal at the end of April and beginning of May
 ” pradooshan niyantran board kaa keval rajdhani shimla kaa hi espm kaa paimaana dekhen to is saal ab tak yah 40

 shimla, sirmaur or solan sabase adhik prabhavit jile hai
 Apparently, forest fires are polluting the state's air
 aag bujhaata rajasvakumaun vishvavidhyalay main forestry department ke vibhaagadhyaksh professor jeet ram ke mutabik, chid himalay kii sabase sakht prajati he or yah aag lagane ke saath badhati he
 The pine forests shed an average of three tonnes of leaves per hectare every year
 aag se bachane ke liye inaki pattiyon kaa niyamit uthaav jaruri he
 According to Jeet Ram, the only solution can be the commercial use of these leaves

 However, an attempt of this variety is continuing in Pithoragarh district
 yahaan is pirul se bijli banane ke liye 9 kilowat kaa bijli sanyantr lagaaya gaya he or philhal yah 200 gharon main roshni pahunchaa rahaa he
 It was started in 2009 by a company called Avni Bio Energy
 company ab chacharet naamak jagah par 120 kilowat kaa ek or bijli sanyantr lagane kii yojana bana rahi he
 Rajneesh Jain, associated with this company, explains, "the pine leaves are cut and burned by supplying controlled oxygen to a gasifier, giving a mixture of carbon mono oxide, methane and hydrogen
 ise saaf or thanda kar ek jenerator main bharkar isse bijli hasil kii jaati he
 "in 1997-98, an mou was made between the forest department and some entrepreneurs to make bricks used for fuel through these leaves, but this plan could not be realized due to the high cost of lifting the trees from the forest
 har haalat main jinda rahata he chirchid jangalon ke punarjanan main behad sahaayak hota he
 This is because this species can also live in areas where the soil has little nutrients
 chid main aag pratirohak kshamta bhi hoti he
 Especially the greenery in the Himalayan plateau is attributed to the pine

 Singh does not consider it appropriate to hold Chir responsible for the fire
 ve kehete hai, “uttarakhand main aag swaabhaavik taur par na to pattharon kii chinagaari se lagati he, na hi pedo kii aapasi ragad se, jaisaaki bataane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The reason is anthropogenic
 mumkin he aag van vibhaag ke control burning ke vakt lagaai gai ho, jo baad main fail gai ho yaa phir gaanvvaalon ne is dharna se lagaai ho ki barsaat main ghaas kii koplein jaldi ugkar nai ghaas jaldi milegi
 "on the involvement of forest smugglers in the fire incident, Dr
 ajay ravat kehete hai, “agar van taskar aag lagaate to pakade jate kyonki bade vrikshon ko uthaane kii mashkkat karte hue unhen pakadia aaj aasaan ho gaya he
 So forest smugglers cannot be the cause of this fire in the forest

 Wildlife and flora are the biggest threat to the wildlife here due to fire in Khatraj forests

 Lalit Tiwari, Professor, Department of Botany, Kumaon University, says, "many vegetation may be on the verge of extinction due to fire

 It is not surprising if large animals such as lions and tigers are hiding in the bushes to escape the fire
 unke mutabik, repatiles kii prajatiyon par bhi is aag ne khatra paidaa kar diya he
 Apart from this, all the breeds of butterflies were also killed
 prakritik sroton par bhi is aag kii maar padi he
 Scientists estimate that the haze and carbon dioxide produced in the atmosphere are harmful to the glaciers here
 khatra yah he ki carbon ke kan jab barish ke saath jameen par girenge or glaciaron main chipkenge to unki galan dar bad jaaegi or isse kai prakritik aapadaaon ko badhaava mil saktaa he

 "the rains in Himachal and Uttarakhand in early May brought news of relief for the burning forests of Chir and Banj

 com / xyvzqv1ug8— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag)april 1, 2017 The talk of Marathi film producer Atul Tapakir committing suicide has come to light, which has shocked the entire Marathi film industry
 aapako bataa den ki atul tapakir marathi film 'dholtashe' ke nirmaataa rah chuke he or marathi film industry kaa janaa mana cheharaa rah chuke he
 Atul committed suicide in a hotel in Pune adjacent to Mumbai
 jis hotel main atul ne aatmahatya kii us hotel kaa naam da president hotel bataaya ja rahaa he jahaan atul ne pehle to apni puri kahani fasebuk par likhi or uske baad jehar khaakar suicide kar liya
 In his suicide note, Atul clearly wrote that how he is troubled in his life and the reason for his trouble is his wife Priyanka
 atul ne apane suicide note main likhaa ki priyanka naa sirf unhen maansik pratadana detii thi balki unhen unke bacchon se bhi dur rakhti thi
 Priyanka was also abusive with Atul's family members
 saath hi atul ko 6 maheene pehle priyanka ne ghar se bhi nikaal diya tha
 Atul's trouble was not only his wife Priyanka but also a lot of debt on Atul, which he mentioned in his suicide note
 atul ne marane se pehle ye saaf jaahir kiya kii kis kadar mahilaayein kanoon kaa galat phayda uthaati he or purushon ko julm sahane padate he
 Atul appealed to the government on the go that he should listen to men also

 The DDA is building around 10,000 new flats here, but the situation here is such that investors do not see much benefit
 nae flats ke paas hi didie ke puraane flats hai
 There are around 1800 One Bedroom Flats in Sector 10 of Narela
 yahaan 1993 se lekar ab tak flats aavantit ho rahe hai
 Nevertheless, about 40 percent of the flats are empty
 na inke uchit daam mil rahe hai or na hi khariddaar
 According to the property dealer AS Khatri, this area is far from development
 koi metro connactivity nahin he
 Roads are in shabby condition
 shopping complex nahin hai
 There are no good schools for children
 college or aspataal nahin he
 And the biggest thing is that there are no proper security arrangements in the area
 aise main praparty kii keemat sthir si ho gai he
 Nearby is Sector B-2
 yahaan ke van vedroom flats 2006 main logon ko aavantit hue

 At the same time, the relationship between India and Israel has strengthened in the last 25 years, but so far no Prime Minister of the country has visited Israel
 lihaaja, is yatra ko kar pradhanmantri modi israel jane vaale desh ke pehle pradhanmantri honge
 Israel and America: Due to the geopolitics of geopolitical angels, Donald Trump, who won the recent US election, made important promises during the campaign

 Although the Jewish people still have sensations about this place, but due to the seriousness of the case, there is no attempt to clear the situation by archaeological excavation here
