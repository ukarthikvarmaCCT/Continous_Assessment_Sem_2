 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher

 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65

 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received

 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi

 For the last five days, the students here were performing in the morning and evening

 The administration also wrote letters to family members to scare students

 But the students did not back down

 There are 17000 students studying in Jamia, if not the freedom of the union here, then how will the students here fight for freedom of expression on all issues
 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised

 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union
 chaatr sangh bhi spes aaf protest he
 On October 13, the Kerala High Court issued an interim order that the campus of the college not be protected, as the institutes are meant for study, the campus should remain at stake and protest free

 There are 17000 students studying in Jamia, if not the freedom of the union here, then how will the students here fight for freedom of expression on all issues
 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised

 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union

 This institution reports to the Governor, the Governor reports to the President that there is no exploitation and exploitation in the tribal area
 in netaaon kaa aarope he ki is council ko niskriy kar diya gaya taaki audyogic gharaanon ke hiton ke liye unke sansadhano ko bechaa ja sake
 There is also a stir in the Bhil dominated area of rajasthan regarding the fifth schedule

 The same situation is with student politics
 magar kai jagahon par chaatr is fremawork se baahar aakar apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The movement has been launched by the name of Mumbai University Bachao

 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them

 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman

 haal hi main yah sanghathan khadaa hua he
 Bhil demands the territory
 bhil pradesh vidhyaarthee morcha ne chaar-chaar college main abivipi or enesayuai ko takkar di he
 That is why i am saying that let the debate of India's democracy come out of the framework of debates thrown by Congress and BJP
 bahut kuch nayaa hota milegaa aapako
 In this 16th issue of the University Series, we will talk about student movements going on in some colleges
 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad
 uniwarsity series ke dauraan kisi bhi shikshak sangh ne is baat kii zarurat nahin samajhi ki sampark kar or bhi jaankaree di jaae
 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left
 yahi haal chaatr raajnneeti kaa bhi he
 But in many places students are coming out of this framework and fighting their battles
 mumbai uniwarsity bachaao naam se andolan laanch ho gaya he
 Due to online copy checking there has been a delay of months in getting the results and there have been a lot of messes in the results
 mumbai uniwarsity ke chaatr lagaataar andolan kar rahe hai
 On 31 October, banners were brought on which was written Save Mumbai University
 is andolan main purv rajyasabha saansad or purv visi mungekar bhi shaamil ho gaye hai
 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai
 And due to the delay in the result, Mumbai University should help in the admission in other institutions which have not been admitted
 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email
 jawaab main likhaa he ki ve uniwarsi series dekh rahe hai magar ye nahin sochaa hoga ki ham unheen tak pahunch jaaenge
 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not
 ghaziabad ke santosh medical uniwarsity ke shikshak colector ke daftar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 It also has non-teaching and students

 Santosh Medical University is a centralized deemed university
 pi mahalingam sahab iske sansthaapak hai jinaki buudhvaar ko yani 1 november ko adishnal district magistrate ke saath baithak hone vaali he
 Institute records have also been checked in ADM
 shikshakon kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke baas se unhen niyamit selary nahin mil rahi he
 Management is not giving reasons while admissions are also completed
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki 2013 se pief kaa farm jamaa nahin ho rahaa he
 These teachers have been protesting for a month
 ye shikshak bhi apane virodh se pehle chaatr sanghathanon ke pradarshnon par hansaa karte honge, aaj inhen khud pradarshan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Registrar Dr VP Gupta has ordered that post-graduate and under-graduate studies be discontinued from October 30 until further orders due to unavoidable reasons
 uniwarsity ne apana ek imhataan bhi radd kar diya he
 We spoke to the registrar of Santosh Medical College
 ve pi gupta ne kaha ki pichley saal se piji or bidies kii siten khaali chali gayi hai jisase college aarthik chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Gradually the situation will be fixed
 dhire-dhire ham saare logon kii selary release kar rahe hai
 It is good that the Ghaziabad administration has taken initiative in this matter and after meeting with the college chairman on November 1, an attempt will be made to resolve the problem
 har jagah kii samasya ek hi he magar sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted
 somvaar raat paune nau baje yani prime time shuru hone se pehle chaatro ne andolan samaapti kaa elaan kar diya
 The administration has accepted most of the students' demands
 pichley paanch dinon se yahaan ke chaatr subah shaam pradarshan kar rahe the
 Their main demands were from security to water and sanitation
 andolan kaa nateeja hi tha ki hastal or college ke campus main nayaa water cooler aa gaya
 Cleanliness was also done
 prashasan ne chaatro ko daraane ke liye parivaar waalon ko bhi patr likhaa
 In which it was said that if your children continue to perform like this, then the semester may be missed
 magar chaatr peeche nahin hate
 He slept in the classroom, did not go to his room
 ab samjhauta ho gaya he or maange maan lee gayi hai
 Miran Haider, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia, has been on hunger strike for 7 days
 unke saath kai or chaatr hadtaal par hai or din raat dharne par baith rahe hai
 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse
 shamsi mustafa or imran ahamed bhi bhukh hadtaal par baithe the jinhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before
 maine khud cover kiya he magar vahaan bhi pradarshan band kar diya gaya
 The park was created
 vot club par raily kii tasviir aapako veepi singh, devilal, choudhary charan singh, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar kiske ghar par nahin hogi, magar vahaan to kab se yah sab band ho chukaa he
 The NGT has not given any other place but has said that the movement will go to another place like Kari Ramlila Maidan
 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year
 wo ise muft main nahin dena chaahati he
 MCD is the institution of democracy, its representatives come from the public and they are now saying that they will not give grounds to perform free
 spes of protest, pradarshan kii jagah kaa sthaan loktantr main janata kii sansad ke samaan hota he
 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 But in this PG college of Dhar, 39 student representatives of tribal students' organization have won, out of which 35 are girls

 In 2011, ABVP flourished in this college

 The new organization, Jayas, has waved its glory
 alirajpur ke sondva kalege main sabhi padon par adivasee chaatr sangh ke ummidavaar nirvirodh jite hai
 This is another student organization whose demand is similar to Jayas but they are not ABVP and NSUI
 gondvanaa student union ne bhi 21 siten hasil kii hai
 The news of Jayas' victory has been featured prominently in the Dhar edition of the magazine
 isi ke saath madhya pradesh main ek nae sanghathan or nae yuvaaon kaa udai hota he
 What will happen later, who will split between them, buy them, this will happen, but their success in the field of Dhar Bhojshala controversy is not modest
 paanchavi anusuchee ke anusaar adivasee bahul kshetron ko visheshadhikaar hasil he
 Their involvement in planning and implementation has been ensured and security has been provided to ensure that this area is not exploited and exploited, but where it happens
 dilli se yojana banakar jaati he or vahaan se andolan kii khabaron ko naksal frem main rakhkar gaayab kar diya jaataa he

 Members of which are Scheduled Tribe mps and mlas
 kaayade se is council kaa mukhiya bhi adivasee hona chahie magar mukhyamantri hote hai
 This institution reports to the Governor, the Governor reports to the President that there is no exploitation and exploitation in the tribal area
 in netaaon kaa aarope he ki is council ko niskriy kar diya gaya taaki audyogic gharaanon ke hiton ke liye unke sansadhano ko bechaa ja sake
 There is also a stir in the Bhil dominated area of rajasthan regarding the fifth schedule
 haal hi main vahaan bhi chaatr sangh ke chunaav hue hai
 The news of ABVP and SFI or NSUI winning came in the media of Delhi but you look at the magazine newspaper edition

 Bhil Pradesh Vidyarthi Morcha has won the four posts of president, vice-president, general secretary, joint secretary in the four colleges of Dungarpur, Sagwara, Seemalwara

 Recently this organization has stood up
 bhil pradesh kii maang karata he
 Bhil Pradesh Vidyarthi Morcha has contested ABVP and NSUI in four colleges
 isliye kah rahaa hum ki bharat ke loktantr kii bahes ko congress or bijepi kii phenki hui bahason ke fremawork se baahar nikal dekhie
 You will find a lot of new things happening
 uniwarsity siries ke is 16 wein ank main ham kuch collejon main chal rahe chaatr andolanon kii baat karenge
 The teachers movement too
 in donon andolanon kii haalat bahut karaab he
 During the University Series, no teachers' union thought it necessary to contact and give more information
 sab congress bijepi or left ke fremawork main bante hue hai or fanse hue hai
 The same situation is with student politics
 magar kai jagahon par chaatr is fremawork se baahar aakar apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The movement has been launched by the name of Mumbai University Bachao
 online copy checking ke kaaran nattejey aane main maheenon kii deree hui he or nattejey main kaaphi gadabadiyaan hui hai
 Students of Mumbai University are continuously agitating
 31 aktubar ke din binar lekar aa gaye jis par likhaa tha seve mumbai uniwarsity
 Former Rajya Sabha MP and former VC Mungekar has also joined the movement
 in chaatro ne kalina campus ke mahatma jyotirav phule bhawan ke saamne baithkar dharna diya he
 It is also written on their banner that education is not for sale
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki sabhi chaatro ko paas karo, das din ke bheetar nateeja ghoshit karo
 Students are seeking written assurance

 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them
 inhen is baat kaa dukh he ki sohit ne jane se pehle prabandhan ko kyon nahin bataaya
 Think of yourself, if we had told, would the management take it to its teachers that yes, now say that you are not getting salary
 chairman nandu ji ne likhaa he ki unhen pichhadi jati ke hone ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 He says that 'all the allegations of teachers are baseless and factless

 We want to assure you that the maximum salary will be paid before May 2018
 zyaadaatar shikshak do teen saal puraane hai to 2011 se selary na milane kii baat kaise sahi ho sakati he
 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai
 Go away quickly
 hamane pachaason college or bison uniwarsity kii kharaab haalat par siries kii he
 Chairman Sahib is the first to defend himself from such weak arguments

 Talk over
 lab nahin chal rahe hai to chalaa dijie
 We are not quoting the entire aspect of their mail, otherwise the Chairman would say that the hour we speak you should show that hour
 sohit mishra apni report par kaayam hai
 The Chairman has written that he is my fan
 mujhe aise fain par niraashaa hui or aapse bhi nivedan he kisi kaa fain mat banie, system dekhie wo thik ho rahaa he yaa nahin

 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised

 During the University Series, no teachers' union thought it necessary to contact and give more information

 The same situation is with student politics

 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he

 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party

 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them

 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai

 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader

 In this 16th issue of the University Series, we will talk about student movements going on in some colleges
 shikshakon ke andolan kii bhi
 The condition of both these movements is very bad

 All are divided and trapped in the framework of Congress BJP and Left

 These students have staged a sit-in in front of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Bhawan on Kalina Campus
 inke binar par yah bhi likhaa he ki shiksha bikaoo nahin he
 Students say that pass all the students, declare the result within ten days
 chaatr likhit aashwaasan maang rahe hai

 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar chairman Nandu Tasgaonkar has sent his reply via email
 jawaab main likhaa he ki ve uniwarsi series dekh rahe hai magar ye nahin sochaa hoga ki ham unheen tak pahunch jaaenge
 He is sad about why Sohit did not tell the management before leaving
 aap hi sochie, ham bataa kar jate to prabandhan kya apane shikshakon ke paas le jaataa ki haa ji ab bolie ki aapako selary nahin mil rahi he
 Chairman Nandu ji has written that he is being targeted due to being a backward caste
 unka kahana he ki 'shikshakon ke saare aarope aadharahin or tathyaheen hai
 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 Meeran Haider and his colleagues demand that when there is a teacher union, there is an employee union then why is there no student union
 jamiya ne ek ranneeti ke tahat chaatr sangh ko khatm kar diya he
 Whenever there is talk of forming a student union, there is a delay
 jab chaatro ke pratinnidhi mandal ne is cese ko lard rahe vakil se mulaakaat kii tab bataa chalaa ki 2011 ke vaais chancelar chaatr sangh nahin chaahate the
 The University is an autonomous institution
 prashasan chaahe to aaj chunaav ho saktaa he jaise jeenyu main hota he
 The VC says that the matter is stuck in the court, but the students say that this is an excuse
 shamsi mustafa or imran ahamed bhi bhukh hadtaal par baithe the jinhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 MP Ali Anwar has also come in support of this Jamia movement
 auskar furnandis bhi aae hai
 Many alumni leaders of Jamia are coming
 diu se bhi ratan laal or sachin narayan yahaan bhaashan de chuke hai
 jnu's student organization and teachers' organization have also lent their support
 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government
 andolan nahin honge to awaz kaise uthegi
 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he
 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society
 adaalat kaa aadesh he to police or endiemasi ne sabko bason main thuns kar yahaan se hataa diya
 The echo of the Nirbhaya movement was heard here, Anna Hazare started the movement from here, who would not have performed the BJP Congress Left here
 bahut se kamazor log yahaan dharne par baithe mil jate the ki yahaan aate jate media kii nigaah pad jaae or baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaae
 a command snatched the voice away
 yahaan ab gamale lagaae jaaenge
 Similarly, there were demonstrations behind the Red Fort once before
 maine khud cover kiya he magar vahaan bhi pradarshan band kar diya gaya
 The park was created
 vot club par raily kii tasviir aapako veepi singh, devilal, choudhary charan singh, sharad yadav, lalu yadav, nitish kumaar kiske ghar par nahin hogi, magar vahaan to kab se yah sab band ho chukaa he
 The NGT has not given any other place but has said that the movement will go to another place like Kari Ramlila Maidan
 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year
 wo ise muft main nahin dena chaahati he
 MCD is the institution of democracy, its representatives come from the public and they are now saying that they will not give grounds to perform free
 spes of protest, pradarshan kii jagah kaa sthaan loktantr main janata kii sansad ke samaan hota he
 Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan told that there was a 55-55 days' strike in the Statue Circle of Jaipur
 shahar ko pataa chalaa, log jude or desh ko pataa chalaa ki soochna ke adhikaar jaisaa koi adhikaar mil saktaa he, manaregaa jaisaa kanoon ban saktaa he
 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city
 aisa nahin he ki hamen or aap ko pradarshan kii zarurat nahin he, kaayade se har jagah sarkaar ko pradarshan karne kii jagah muft deni chahie, vahaan tak jane ke liye bas deni chahie, har tarah kii suvidha honi chahie kyonki jo pradarshan karata he wo loktantr ko sundar banaata he, jeevant banaata he
 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 The news of ABVP and SFI or NSUI winning came in the media of Delhi but you look at the magazine newspaper edition
 khabar kisi nae sanghathan ke aahat kii baat kar rahi he
 Bhil Pradesh Vidyarthi Morcha has won the four posts of president, vice-president, general secretary, joint secretary in the four colleges of Dungarpur, Sagwara, Seemalwara
 yah morcha bhi paanchavi anusoochi ko lekar mukhar he
 Recently this organization has stood up
 bhil pradesh kii maang karata he
 Bhil Pradesh Vidyarthi Morcha has contested ABVP and NSUI in four colleges
 isliye kah rahaa hum ki bharat ke loktantr kii bahes ko congress or bijepi kii phenki hui bahason ke fremawork se baahar nikal dekhie
 You will find a lot of new things happening
 uniwarsity siries ke is 16 wein ank main ham kuch collejon main chal rahe chaatr andolanon kii baat karenge
 The teachers movement too
 in donon andolanon kii haalat bahut karaab he
 During the University Series, no teachers' union thought it necessary to contact and give more information
 sab congress bijepi or left ke fremawork main bante hue hai or fanse hue hai
 The same situation is with student politics
 magar kai jagahon par chaatr is fremawork se baahar aakar apni ladaai lard rahe hai
 The movement has been launched by the name of Mumbai University Bachao
 online copy checking ke kaaran nattejey aane main maheenon kii deree hui he or nattejey main kaaphi gadabadiyaan hui hai
 Students of Mumbai University are continuously agitating
 31 aktubar ke din binar lekar aa gaye jis par likhaa tha seve mumbai uniwarsity
 Former Rajya Sabha MP and former VC Mungekar has also joined the movement
 in chaatro ne kalina campus ke mahatma jyotirav phule bhawan ke saamne baithkar dharna diya he
 It is also written on their banner that education is not for sale
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki sabhi chaatro ko paas karo, das din ke bheetar nateeja ghoshit karo
 Students are seeking written assurance
 or rigelt main deree ke kaaran duusare sansthaanon main jinke admician nahin ho paae hai, usamen mumbai uniwarsity madad kare
 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them
 inhen is baat kaa dukh he ki sohit ne jane se pehle prabandhan ko kyon nahin bataaya
 Think of yourself, if we had told, would the management take it to its teachers that yes, now say that you are not getting salary
 chairman nandu ji ne likhaa he ki unhen pichhadi jati ke hone ke kaaran nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 He says that 'all the allegations of teachers are baseless and factless
 pief ke maamle main kanoon apana kaam kar rahaa he
 We want to assure you that the maximum salary will be paid before May 2018
 zyaadaatar shikshak do teen saal puraane hai to 2011 se selary na milane kii baat kaise sahi ho sakati he
 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai
 Go away quickly
 hamane pachaason college or bison uniwarsity kii kharaab haalat par siries kii he
 Chairman Sahib is the first to defend himself from such weak arguments
 shikshak kii selary nahin mil rahi he to koi jhooth kyon bolegaa, nahin mil rahi he to de dijie
 Talk over
 lab nahin chal rahe hai to chalaa dijie
 We are not quoting the entire aspect of their mail, otherwise the Chairman would say that the hour we speak you should show that hour
 sohit mishra apni report par kaayam hai
 The Chairman has written that he is my fan
 mujhe aise fain par niraashaa hui or aapse bhi nivedan he kisi kaa fain mat banie, system dekhie wo thik ho rahaa he yaa nahin

e
 November 1
 ediem main santhaan ke record bhi check kiye hai
 Teachers say that they are not getting regular salary from demonetisation bass
 prabandhan kaaran nahin bataa rahaa he jabaki admician bhi puure hue hai
 The teachers allege that since 2013, the PF form has not been submitted
 ye shikshak ek maheene se virodh kar rahe hai
 These teachers must have laughed at the demonstrations of the student organizations before their protest, they have to demonstrate themselves today
 register doctor ve pi gupta ne aadesh nikaala he ki aprihaary kaarnon se post graduate or under graduate kii padhai 30 aktubar se agle aadesh tak ke liye band kii jaati he
 The university has also canceled one of its examinations
 hamane santosh medical college ke register se baat kii
 VP Gupta said that since last year the seats of PG and BDS have gone vacant due to which the college is facing economic challenges
 dhire-dhire halaat thik ho jaaenge
 Slowly we are releasing the salary of all the people
 acchhee baat he ki ghaziabad prashasan ne is masale main pahal kii he or ek november ko college ke chayaraman se baithak ke baad samasya ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya jayega
 The problem is the same everywhere, but everyone is fighting his own battle
 dilli ke skool of planning and architect ke chaatro ne apni maangen manavaa lee he
 The students announced the end of the agitation before the commencement of prime time at 9
45 pm on Monday night
 prashasan ne chaatro kii zyaadaatar maange maan lee he
 For the last five days, the students here were performing in the morning and evening
 suraksha se lekar pani or safai kii vyavastha unki mukhya maange thim
 The result of the movement was that a new water cooler arrived in the hostels and college campuses
 safai bhi ho gai
 The administration also wrote letters to family members to scare students
 jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki agar aapke bachche isi tarah pradarshan karte rahe to semester miss ho saktaa he
 But the students did not back down
 classroom main sote rahe, apane kamare main nahin gaye
 The agreement has now been reached and demands have been agreed
 jamiya milia islamia ke chaatr miraan haidar 7 dinon se bhukh hadtaal par hai
 Many more students are on strike with them and are sitting on dharna day and night
 miraan haidar or unke saathiyon kii maang he ki jab yahaan shikshak union he, karmchaaree union he to chaatr sangh kyon nahin he
 Jamia has ended the student union as a strategy
 chaatr sangh banane kii jab bhi baat hoti he taalamatol hone lagati he
 When the students 'delegation met the lawyer who was fighting the case, it was revealed that the Vice Chancellor of 2011 did not want the Students' Union
 uniwarsity swytt sanstha he
 If the administration wants, elections can be held today as it happens in JNU
 visi kehete hai ki maamla court main atka he magar chaatr kehete hai ki ye bahaanaa he
 Shamsi Mustafa and Imran Ahmed were also on hunger strike who were admitted to the hospital
 jamiya ke is andolan ke samarthan main saansad ali anwar bhi aa chuke hai
 Oscar Fernandes has also arrived
 jamiya ke kai purv chaatr netaa aa rahe hai
 Ratan Lal and Sachin Narayan have also given speeches here from DU
 jeenyu ke chaatr sanghathan or shikshakon ke sanghathan ne bhi apana samarthan diya he
 There are 17000 students studying in Jamia, if not the freedom of the union here, then how will the students here fight for freedom of expression on all issues
 chaatr sanghathan nahin hone se college main jane vaale chaatr awaz nahin uthaa pate
 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries
 har taraf chuppi he
 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader
 andolan kii zarurat aapako he, sarkaar ko nahin
 If there are no movements then how will the voice be raised
 ab sochie dilli main pradarshan jantar mantar par nahin hoga to kahaan hoga
 The comments vaise ab jantar mantar par nahin ho sakegaa
 Jantar Mantar has been evacuated following orders from the National Green Tribunal
 aam janata kii kai maangen is choti si jagah se uthi hai or yahaan se kareeb main bani sansad or sarkaar tak pahunchi hai
 The noise from the loudspeaker was stopped here
 gali mohalle main laudspikar se shor ho rahaa he koi band nahin kar rahaa he magar loktantr ke liye jo jagah he wo dhwani pradooshan ke naam par band kar di gai or samaaj main kisi prakaar kii bechaini nahin hui
 If the court orders, then the police and NDMC dumped everyone in buses and removed them from here
 nirbhaya andolan kii gunj yaheen sunai di thi, anna hazaare ne yaheen se andolan kiya, bijpi congress left kisne yahaan pradarshan nahin kiya hoga
 Many weak people used to meet sitting on dharna here so that the media would get noticed while coming here and the matter should reach the government
 ek aadesh se awaz chhin gai
 Pottery will now be planted here
 isi tarah pehle kabhi laal kila ke peeche pradarshan hote the
 i myself have covered but the performance was stopped there too
 park bana diya gaya
 On Vote Club, you will get the picture of the rally VP Singh, Devi Lal, Chaudhary Charan Singh, Sharad Yadav, Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar, whose house will not be there, but it has been closed since then
 engiti ne koi duusari jagah nahin di he magar kaha he ki andolan kaari ramlila maidan jaisi duusari jagah jaaenge
 The one-day performance in a 12-acre Ramlila ground is Rs 50,000
 isse emsidi ko saal main 3 se 4 karod kii kamai hoti he
 She does not want to give it away for free
 loktantr kii sanstha he emsidi, iske pratinidhi janata se chunakar aate hai, wo ab kah rahe hai ki free main pradarshan karne ke liye maidan nahin denge
 The space of Protest, the place of demonstration, is similar to the Parliament of the people in a democracy
 mazdoor kisaan shakti sanghathan ke nikhil de ne bataaya ki jaipur ke stechu cirkil main 55-55 dinon kaa dharna chalaa
 The city came to know, people connected and the country came to know that any right like right to information can be obtained, a law like MNREGA can be made
 nikhil ne kaha ki artiai main jab pehle saal upie koi sanshodhan karnaa chaahati thi to iske khilaaf jantar mantar par pradarshan hua or unki jeet hui tab unke saathi shankar ne ek gaanaa likhaa tha jantar kii mantar kii jai jai bolo
 Today you cannot perform a sit-down near the Statue Circle in Jaipur
 shahar main pradshan kii jagah nahin he
 It is not that we and you do not need to perform, as always the government should give free space to perform everywhere, just to go to that place, there should be every kind of facility because the one who performs democracy Beautifies, makes it lively
 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union
 chaatr sangh bhi spes aaf protest he
 On October 13, the Kerala High Court issued an interim order that the campus of the college not be protected, as the institutes are meant for study, the campus should remain at stake and protest free
 uniwarsity siries ke is 16 wein ank main ham kuch collejon main chal rahe chaatr andolanon kii baat karenge

 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union
 chaatr sangh bhi spes aaf protest he
 On October 13, the Kerala High Court issued an interim order that the campus of the college not be protected, as the institutes are meant for study, the campus should remain at stake and protest free

 sohit mishra mumbai se sate raigarh zile ke karajat ilaake ke ek privet college yadavarao tasagaonkar college main chal rahe pradarshan kaa gauge lene gaye
 The teachers here have alleged that they have not been getting regular salary since 2012
 kabhi miltaa he to kabhi kai maheene ke baad miltaa he
 Spread over 70 acres, the campus has 2 engineering colleges, a pharmacy college, a polytechnic, a management and a school
 ye saare mumbai uniwarsity se sambanddh hai
 About five and six thousand students study here
 sohit mishra ne dekha ki college to baahar se thik thaak dikhataa he magar andar se haalat karaab he
 The Engineering College lab has machines but is closed for two to three years
 barsaat ke samay chat tapakati he to pani ko jamaa karne ke liye kai jagah plastic kii bottle rakhi mil gai
 The condition of the toilet is also very bad
 aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki lakhon kii fees dekar chaatr kis tip ke ejeeniyar ban rahe hai
 The teachers have covered their helplessness like a dushala, they say that the salary fixed by the government is 65,000 then teachers get 30,000 here
 yahi nahin, yahaan jo post graduage paas karata he, use hi shikshak bana diya jaataa he
 Many teachers have left the college due to non-payment of salary
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ejineering and technalji college main jahaan 111 shikshak the ab 65 hi rah gaye hai
 There are only 6 professors in 26 in the mechanical department
 civil department main 26 main se 8 professor hi hai
 The teachers allege that the college has stopped filling the Provident Form
 in shikshakon ne apane shoshan ke khilaaf college ke management, shiksha mantri, mukhyamantri sabase baat kii, prativedan diya magar mila sirf aashwaasan or bhaashan
 Teachers are saying that if they do not get salary, then they are not able to pay even the school fees of the children
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki is saal maatr 3 maheene kaa vetan nahin mila he
 16 months of salary has been left so far
 jab shikshak hi chaatro ke andolan ko protsaahit nahin karenge to ek din unki bhi haalat yahi ho jaaegi
 There will be no one to speak for those teachers as well
 desh bhar main shikshak sanghon ke patan kii nishaani he ki ab aapako unke zarie uniwarsity kii badtar haalat par koi awaz sunai nahin detaa kyonki sab apane apane dal kii sarkaar main set ho chuke hai

 The law is doing its work in the case of PF
 ham aapako aashwast karnaa chaahate hai may 2018 se pehle adhiktam selary kaa bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Most teachers are two to three years old, so how can the right to not get salary since 2011? hamaare yahaan 50 se 60 fisadi chaatr pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati ke hai
 50 to 60 percent of our revenue comes from scholarship and freeship, so salary is related to revenue
 ham 40 fisadi rajasav ke sahare kaise santhaan chalaa sakate hai
 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018
 nahin mil rahi hogi tabhi to kah rahe hai ki may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 Nevertheless, the Chairman feels that this story is wrong
 chairman sahab ke jawaab main pad kii garima kam dhamkee zyada he
 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late
 jaldi chale jate hai
 We have done a series on the poor condition of fifty colleges and twenty universities
 chairman sahab pehle hai jo itane kamazor tarkon se apana bachaav kar rahe hai
 If the teacher's salary is not available, then why would anyone lie, if it is not available then give it
 baat khatm
 If the labs are not running, then run them
 ham inke mail ke saare pahalu ko kot nahin kar rahe hai varna chairman sahab kahenge ki ham jitna ghanta bolenge aap utana ghanta dikhaaiye
 Sohit Mishra stands by his report
 chairman sahab ne likhaa he ki ve mere fain hai
 i felt disappointed at such a fan and also request you not to become a fan of anyone, see if the system is getting well or not

 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere
 jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai wo apane jokhim par kar rahe hai baaki tamaasha dekhte hai tab tak jab tak ve khud kisi shoshan kaa shikaar nahin ho jate or kisi chaatr netaa yaa shikshak netaa kii talash main nahin lag jate
 You need the movement, not the government

 Now imagine where the protest will be at Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 tippaniyan By the way, Jantar Mantar will not be available now
 neshnal green tribunel ke aadesh ke baad jantar mantar ko khaali karvaa diya gaya he

 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year

 Nikhil said that when the UPA wanted to make any amendment in the RTI first year, there was a protest against it at Jantar Mantar and when he won, his partner Shankar wrote a song called Jantar ki Mantar ki Jai Jai Bolo
 aaj aap jaipur ke stechu cirkil ke paas dharna pradarshan nahin kar sakate hai
 There is no place of presentation in the city

 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie
 Sohit Mishra went to observe the ongoing demonstration at Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College, a private college in Karjat area of raigad district adjoining Mumbai
 yahaan ke shikshakon kaa aarope he ki unhen 2012 se hi niyamit rup se vetan nahin miltaa he
 Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it after several months
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he
 These are all related to Mumbai University
 yahaan kareeb saadhe paanch se chah hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 Sohit Mishra saw that the college looks fine from outside but the condition is bad from inside
 enginirinring college ke lab main mashine to hai magar do teen saal se band hai
 When the roof drips during the rainy season, plastic bottles were found in many places to store water
 shauchalay kii haalat bhi bahut karaab he
 You can guess what type of students are becoming engineers by paying fees of millions
 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he
 These teachers spoke against their exploitation, the management of the college, the education minister, the chief minister, gave the report but got only the assurance and speech
 shikshak kah rahe hai ki selary nahin milti he to ve bacchon kii skool fees tak nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party
 yadavarao tasagaonkar ke chairman nandu tasganvkar ne email ke zarie apana jawaab bheja he
 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them

 We want to assure you that the maximum salary will be paid before May 2018
 zyaadaatar shikshak do teen saal puraane hai to 2011 se selary na milane kii baat kaise sahi ho sakati he
 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi
 If we are not getting it then we are saying that we will get it by May 2018
 phir bhi chairman sahab ko lagata he ki ye story galat he
 The dignity of the post is less threatening in response to the Chairman
 ve jab yah kehane lagate hai ki kya aapane in shikshakon kaa paanch saal muster role check kiya he, inamen se aap paaenge ki inamen se 40 se 70 fisadi baar ye log let aate hai
 Go away quickly

 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader

 Today you cannot perform a sit-down near the Statue Circle in Jaipur
 shahar main pradshan kii jagah nahin he
 It is not that we and you do not need to perform, as always the government should give free space to perform everywhere, just to go to that place, there should be every kind of facility because the one who performs democracy Beautifies, makes it lively
 vot dena loktantr main sabase aakhri kaam he, usase pehle jo sabase zaruri kaam he, lagaataar kisi jagah par pahunch kar awaz uthaanaa
 Hence the demand of Jamia students that there should be a student union
 chaatr sangh bhi spes aaf protest he
 On October 13, the Kerala High Court issued an interim order that the campus of the college not be protected, as the institutes are meant for study, the campus should remain at stake and protest free
 70 acre main faile is campus main 2 ejineering college he, ek farmesi college he, ek polytechnic, ek manjament or ek skool bhi he

 shikshakon ne apni laachaari ko dushaala kii tarah odh liya he, unka kahana he ki sarkaar se tay vetan 65,000 he to yahaan shikshakon ko 30,000 miltaa he
 Not only this, the post graduate who passes here is made a teacher
 vetan na milane ke kaaran kai shikshakon ne college chhod diya he
 Yadavrao Tasgaonkar College of Engineering and Technology, where there were 111 teachers, is now 65
 mecanical department main 26 main sirf 6 professor rah gaye hai
 There are only 8 out of 26 professors in the civil department
 shikshakon kaa aarope he ki college ne providend farm bharna band kar diya he

 Teachers are saying that this year only 3 months salary has not been received
 abhi tak 16 maheene kaa vetan baaki ho chukaa he
 When teachers will not encourage the students' movement, then one day their condition will also be same
 un shikshakon ke liye bhi bolne vaala koi nahin rahegaa
 It is a sign of the decline of teacher unions across the country that you no longer hear a voice through them on the worsening condition of the university because everyone has been set in the government of his party

 It is written in response that they are watching the Universi series, but would not have thought that we would reach them
 inhen is baat kaa dukh he ki sohit ne jane se pehle prabandhan ko kyon nahin bataaya

 We have 50 to 60 percent students backward and very backward caste
 hamaara 50 se 60 fisadi rajasav scolership or friship se aata he to isliye selary kaa sambandh rajasav se he
 How can we run an institution with 40% revenue? chaatro kii sankhya nahin hone ke kaaran college kaa ek ejineering college band kar diya gaya he isliye unke lab band hai
 ' chairman ne yah bhi kaha ki aapane kitne shikshakon se baat kii, kya aapako lagata he ki 10 fisadi shikshakon se baat kar lene se story jenuin ho jaati he, to kya sau fisadi shikshakon se baat kerani chahie thi, kya aisa hota he, agar do hi shikshakon ko selary nahin mil rahi he jiske bare main khud chairman kehete hai ki adhiktam selary may 2018 tak mil jaaegi

 By the way, where there are no teachers in the college, there is no movement for rigging the appointments of teachers, their low salaries

 The students who are agitating are doing it at their own risk and watch the rest of the spectacle until they themselves become victims of exploitation and start looking for any student leader or teacher leader

 An engineering college of the college has been closed due to lack of students, hence their labs are closed
 ' The chairman also said that how many teachers did you talk to, do you think that talking to 10 percent teachers makes the story genuin, then should you have talked to 100 percent teachers, does it happen, if two The teachers are not getting salary, about which the chairman himself says that maximum salary will be available till May 2018

 When they start saying that if you have done the muster roll check of these teachers for five years, you will find that 40 to 70 percent of these times these people are late

 The students of Delhi's School of Planning and Architect have got their demands accepted

 jamiya main 17000 chaatr padhate hai, yaheen union kii azaadi nahin to yahaan ke chaatr tamaam muddon par abhivyakti kii azaadi kii ladaai kaise ladenge
 Due to not having a student organization, students attending college are unable to raise their voice
 vaise jahaan hai vahaan bhi college main shikshakon ke nahin hone, shikshakon kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee, unke kam vetan ko lekar andolan nahin he
 There is silence everywhere

 Many demands of the general public have arisen from this small place and have reached the Parliament and Government built from here
 yahaan laudspikar se shor ho rahaa tha to band kar diya gaya
 There is noisy noise from loudspeakers in the street, but there is no place in the name of noise pollution and there is no restlessness in the society

 12 acre ke ramlila maidan main ek din ke pradarshan kaa kiraaya 50,000 rupaya he
 With this MCD earns 3 to 4 crores in a year

 Voting is the last thing in a democracy, the most important thing to do before that is to reach out to a place and raise voice
 isliye jamiya ke chaatro kii maang main dam he ki chaatr sangh hona chahie
 The Students' Union is also the Space of Protest
 13 aktubar ko kerala hai court ne antarim aadesh jari kiya he ki kalege ke campus main protest nahin kiya jayega, kyonki santhaan adhyayan ke liye bane hai, campus ko hadtaal or pradarshan mukt rahanaa chahie

 India said that Pakistan, which talks about human rights, should first look at the condition of minorities in Pakistan whose number has gone up from 23 percent to 3 percent
 pakistan ko itihaas nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 Deshidisha Maitra, an ideologue of Pakistan hatred, said that the old law of India which has been removed, Pakistan is spreading wrong things on it

 The people of India need not give advice or advice from any other country

 India said that Imran Khan has misused the UN platform

 unhone kaha ki kabhi cricketer rahe imran khan jo jentalman ke game kii baat karte the, aaj bandooken uthaane or yuddh kii baat karte hai
 India spoke of Imran's speech in the United Nations saying that he has misused this global platform

 takanic ke sahare shaatir thag logon ko chuunaa lagane se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 The problem is that the police also seem helpless in such cases
 taaja maamla gajiabad ke indirapuram ilaake kaa he
 Actually, the vicious thugs first hacked the landline number of Connaught Place police station in Delhi and then called a businessman and got caught in his hoax
 is dauraan thagon ne kaarobaari ke saath kareeb 3 lakh rupee kii thagi kar daali
 It happened that in the Shipra Krishna Vista Society of Indirapuram police station area of ghaziabad, the chemical business is with Amit Agarwal family
 unki fectry anand vihaar ilaake main he
 On the morning of September 19, at around 10:30 in the morning, an unknown person called him from the number 011-23747100
 yah landline number dilli ke conot place thane kaa he
 The caller, describing himself as a policeman from there, told Amit Aggarwal, "people are being called for extortion from their mobile phones and sometimes indecent things are being done
" kai logon ne pareshaan hokar thane main aapke mobile number kii shikaayat kii he
 Amit was shocked to hear this
 unhone phone karne vaale se kaha ki unke number se kisi ko aisi kol nahin kii gai he
 Nor has such things been said to anyone
 is sambandh main mobile sarvice prowider company se sidiaar nikalwakar dekhi ja sakati he
 After this, the phone was disconnected
 agle din yani 20 sitambar kii subah amit ke paas airtel company se ek kol ai
 The caller said that complaints have been lodged in several police stations regarding his number
 amit ne phone karne vaale se kaha ki unke number se aisi koi kol nahin kii gai he
 The caller told Amit Aggarwal that his number had been checked
 aisa lag rahaa he ki kisi ne unke mobile number kaa clon bana liya he
 After hearing all this, Amit was not sure how all this could happen to him
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hui agle din phir se unke paas east dilli ke ek thane se aisa hi phone aayaa or thik agle din vais hi company kii taraf se bhi kol ai
 Now Amit was convinced that someone had cloned his number
 iske baad phir se amit ko company kii taraf se ek kol ai
 This time, the customer care officer trapped him in his bluff
 amit ko email par ek link bheja gaya or kaha gaya ki wo is link se dot sicyor naam kaa ek ap apane mobile main downlod kar len
 Amit did the same at his behest
 wo phone main downlod karne ke baad amit ke phone ke sabhi massej us ap main khulne lage
 The biggest thing is that for 24 hours neither a call came nor went on their mobile
 20 sitambar kii hi raat kareeb 1 baje unke khate se 5 hajaar rupee ke online tranjaction kaa otipi aayaa lekin wo us esemes ko nahin dekh paae
 On the same night, the vicious thugs made a transaction of about three lakh rupees from their credit card
 is baat kaa pataa amit agarwal ko phone se nahin balki american express bank se ai email se chalaa
 Then they came to know that someone had transacted with their credit card
 thagiki is ghatana ke baad peedit amit agarwal ne number ke aadhaar par dilli ke conot place thane ko is sambandh main jaankaree di
 But the staff there categorically denied anyone making such a call or receiving a complaint
 iske baad amit ne thane ke staff se landline number ke paas lage sisitivi camere kii footage use dikhaane kii guzarish kii lekin thane ke pulicekarmiyon ne iske liye bhi manaa kar diya
 The victim Amit Agarwal went to his bank after this
 unhone bank ko ghatana kii sari jaankaree di or poocha ki unke credit card kii jaankaree kaise li ho gai
 How they cheated him so much
 amit kaa aarope he ki bank kaa koi karmchaaree is ghatana main shaamil he
 For this reason, even after four days of the complaint, the bank is only telling them that the IT team is investigating the matter
 amit ke mutabik 4 din baad bank ke staff ne bhi unke phone uthaane band kar die
 They are not even answering calls or emails
 isi baat se pareshaan hokar peedit amit ne indirapuram thane main shikaayat darj karai he
 According to CO Indirapuram, the police is investigating the matter seriously
 prem ehsaason kaa samundar hota he
 In these senses, lovers drift towards a strange destination
 jivan kii kathin laharon ko muskuraakar khete hai
 Each other hugs at the point of the storm
 aah! jivan kitna khubasurat hota he
 Everything looks like a beautiful dream
 lekin sapane or hakeekat main shaayad yahi fark hota he
 There also comes a day when you realize that it was not yours that you had become
 sirf ek insaan kii kami aapako duniyabar ke gamon se bhar jaati he
 This is how love is, but life does not stop for anyone
 koi naa koi aapako is duniya main mil hi jaataa he jisase aapako phir se prem ho jaataa he
 As such, it is futile to try to give any tips in love, but if you take care of some basic things, then you will be a little less tenacious in pain
 ye chaar baaten ganth baandh lijie, dobaaraa prem karne se pehle dhyaan rakhiegaa
 1
 jo biit gaya so biit gaya
 You cried in the memory of someone, gave up eating and drinking, but now someone else has come in your life
 aapaki harkaton kaa usapar bhi asar padegaa isliye puraani baton ko puri tarah bhula dijie or nae saathi ke saath jivan shuru kiijie
 Don't forget to mention old things in front of your new partner
 isse unke man ko chot pahunchati he bhale hi ve naa kahen
 Erase photos, videos, chats and completely separate yourself from the past
 puure samarpan ke saath apane nae saathi ko prem karen
 Believe you will like it
 2
 Understand your mood before getting into a relationship for the second time
 partner chunane main bilkul jaldbaaji naa karen
 If you like being in seclusion, then choose a partner who understands your personal space
 agar aapako aise log nahin pasand jo nasha karte hai to bhi partner ke chunaav ke samay iskaa baat rakhen
 Because everything looks good in the beginning but with the passage of time these small things become bigger
 soshal media par is vigyaapan kii ho rahi he khub aalochana3
 Attachment in love is understandable, but what is so much that the relationship becomes toxic
 isliye partner haaavee hone vaala or 24 ghante hukum chalaane vaala naa ho iskaa dhyaan rakhen
 Relax is important
 bharat main teji se paanv pasaar rahaa he ye khatarnaak virus4
 Some compromises have to be made in life, but keep in mind that you are not the only one
 aapkaa partner bhi agar saportive he to aap uske saath jivan kii gaadi aage badhaane ke bare main soch sakate hai

 philhal petm ne is development ke bare menadhikarik taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 It is not yet clear whether a special app will be launched for this or whether this feature will be added through an update in the existing Paytm app itself
 baharhaal agar aisa hi bhi to company ke liye yah bada chalange he
 Because its number of rivals is high here and their hold is very much around the world including India

 Former Union Minister and Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that no certificate is required from anyone on national security, if the biggest injury was to Pakistan, then during that time there was Congress government in the country
 pakistan ko aadha kar do hisson main baant diya gaya tha
 The Congress leader said that from 1971 to 2019, the Congress remained committed to national security
 lekin congress ne uskaa raajnneetikaran nahin kiya
 The surgical strike was not the first time
 1998 se lagaataar strike hote rahe hai
 Responding to the Congress leader's allegations, Union Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar said that when Bangladesh was formed in 1971, Atal ji called then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as Durga and did not ask for evidence
 aap turant chunaav main gaye the jo 1972 main hone vaala tha
 Javadekar said, "this is the basic difference
 ye hamen samajhnaa chahie
 You are asking for proof
 pehle sargical strike kaa poocha
 
 
 People showed how the target was pierced, how big a blast was inside
 building waisi hi bani rahi, lekin andar kaa sara vinaash ho gaya
 Instead of glorifying the might of the army, evidence is being sought
 "ajtak suraksha sabha kaarykram ke dauraan kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar or congress netaa manish tiwarikendriya mantri ne aage kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav pichley baar jitne samay main samaapt hue the is baar bhi utane hi samay main samaapt honge
 But Mamta ji is saying two months of elections are going on, she will strike another in the middle

 There is so much fear that everything will end
 kendriya mantri ne kaha, "darie mat desh majubat hoga to ham majboot honge
 The economy of number 11 has come down to number 6
 naye bharat kaa nirmaan karne ja rahe hai isamen janata shirkat kar rahi he
 We are seeking votes on the basis of development

 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne spasht kiya ki nai loksabhaa main chaahe sankhya bal kuch bhi ho, agar centre main endie kii sarkaar bani, to keval narendra modi hi pradhanmantri banenge
 In an interview to PTI on chartered aircraft, Rajnath said, "modi will become the Prime Minister in the NDA government under any circumstances
" bijepi adhyaksh kaa yah bayaan us sawaal ke jawaab main aayaa, jisamen unase poocha gaya tha ki agar endie bahumat se peeche rah gai or nae sahyogiyon ne modi se itar duusare netaa par jor diya, tab party kaa kya rukh hoga
 Rajnath said, the country runs not only on the basis of law, but from a leader who has moral strength
 keval vahi vyakti, jise pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar yaa mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he, uske paas hi vah naitik bal hota he
 He dismissed the subject of Modi's refusal to wear a 'gol hat' (skull cap) as a 'non-essential controversy'
 rajnath ne kaha, yah gaiyr jaruri vishay ko raajnneetik pratidwandviyon dwaara anaavashyak rup se tool dene kaa prayaas he
 i wear a dhoti-kurta, he (modi) wears a kurta-pajama, you wear shirt pants
 kya yah koi mudda he? ve (pratidwandvi) desh kaa sampradayikaran karnaa chaahate hai
 He supported the statement by the bjp's prime ministerial candidate refusing to appeal to any particular community to seek votes
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, kisi bhi jati, dharm yaa sampradaay se kisi vishesh rup main vot ke liye apil nahin kii jaani chahie
 Everyone has the freedom to exercise his franchise and it should be freely
 ham samaaj ke sabhi varg ke logon se bina kisi bhedbhaav ke apil karte hai
 In response to a question about the concerns of Muslims, Singh said, "we are gradually removing the apprehensions
" 
 
 baatcheet ke jariye yah bhay dur hoga
 Asked if Modi would hold talks with Muslim leaders, Rajnath only said, the conversation goes on
 modiji bhi unase baatcheet karte hai
 You must have seen that Muslims are now supporting Modi
 unhone daawa kiya ki samudaay ke log (muslim) ab gujarat main adhik surakshit mahasoos karte hai or unki prati vyakti aay desh main anya ilaakon se behatar hui he
 Rajnath said, gradually the message is reaching the Muslims that this was the planned propaganda of Congress and other so-called secular parties
 ve modi or bijepi ke kareeb aana jari rakhenge or bhay kii bhranti samaapt hogi
 Asked whether Modi should apologize for the 2002 riots, Rajnath questioned, most of the riots took place during the Congress rule
 kya unhone maafee maanga? jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kya congress ko pehle maafee maangana chahie, iske baad modi maafee maangenge, unhone kaha, main aisa nahin kah rahaa hum
 If Modi had made a mistake, if he had not tried to stop the riot, he could have apologized
 rajnath ne kaha, lekin mukhyamantri ke taur par unhone dangon ko rokane ke liye adhiktam prayaas kiya, puri koshish kii
 He never attempted to obstruct the investigation
 tab phir abhi bhi maafee kii maang kyon? yah congress kii badale kii bhaavana vaali raajnneeti he
 Describing Modi as the most disturbing political, Rajnath said that the Congress is targeting Modi because he is frustrated with his popularity
 rajnath singh pratidin ausatan teen se chaar reliyon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 He was asked if Modi would have been more acceptable if the 2002 riots had not happened
 unhone kaha, modi kii sweekaaryata abhi bhi he or yah bad rahi he
 No one is unhappy with them from any caste or religion
 log samajhate hai ki congress ne hameshaa sampradayik card khelaa he

 G-7 summit main aaj narendra modi-donald trump kii mulakatjammu-kashmir ke masale par ho sakati he batmadhyasthata ko lekar kai baar bayaan de chuke hai trumpabharat ne bataaya he ki aantarik maamlapradhanmantri narendra modi is vakt france main hai or vahaan par jari G-7 summit main bataur atithi hissaa lene pahunche hai
 Apart from this summit, the meeting that everyone is watching is the meeting between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump
 darasal, beete dinon bharat sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir par jo faisla liya or uske baad se hi donald trump yaa america prashasan kii ore se jo bayaanbaji hui us bich ye mulaakaat kaaphi myne rakhti he
 Trump has been talking about mediation on the Kashmir issue, but has also come back from his point
 aise main agar aaj donon netaa milte hai, to is masale par baat hoti he yaa nahin or agar hoti he to kya baatcheet ho sakati he isapar nazar rahegi
 Amid the changing stance, Trump and Modi met American President Donald Trump in a statement that had caused a stir in the politics of the Indian subcontinent
 imran khan ke saamne trump ne kaha tha ki vah kashmir masale par madhyasthata ko taiyaar hai or iske liye unhone piem modi se bhi baat kii he
 This statement of Trump caused quite a ruckus, the Government of India gave a clarification on this and later called Trump's claim as false
 bharat sarkaar ke jawaab ke baad america ke kai seenet, white house kii taraf se aanan-fanan main safai di gai or bataaya ki jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa dwipaksheeya maamla he, isamen tisare paksh kii jarurat nahin he
 Trump has repeatedly turned around, when the controversy arose after his first statement, Donald Trump once again gave a statement and said that if the Prime Minister of India and Pakistan asks him for mediation, then he is ready for it
 yani vah apni us baat se mukar gaye hai, jahaan unhone modi ke dwaara peshkash kaa daawa kiya tha
 And recently, a few days ago, he again repeated this and asked to be ready for mediation
 is sabhi ke bich somvaar ko donald trump or narendra modi mil rahe hai
 Before leaving for France, Trump had said that he would talk to Modi on the Kashmir issue
 isse pehle donon phone par bhi baat kar chuke hai, aise main ye dekhnaa hoga ki jab donon netaa aamane-saamne honge to kya faisla hota he or rukh kis tarah kaa rahata he
 Because India has made it clear every time and on every platform in the world that whatever dispute about Jammu and Kashmir is between India and Pakistan, the decision regarding Article 370 is India's internal issue

 netaji subhaashachandr bose kii akeli santan anita bose fof germany ke ogsburg main arthshaastri hai
 He spoke to Sandeep Unnithan on the issue of the files related to Netaji being made public by the Government of India
 unhone apane pita ke aakhri palon ko lekar bose parivaar ke bich bhi matbhed hone kii ore ishaara kiya
 He has also demanded a DNA test to conclusively confirm that the bones kept in the Renkoji temple in Japan belong to Netaji, and said that the bones should be brought to India to end the dispute
 prah aap netaji se judi filon ko saarvajanik kiye jane se kitni santusht hai?uh kai itihaaskaar va shikshavid varshon se in dastavejon ko saarvajanik kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai, isliye yah kiya janaa behatar hi tha
 Now after looking at some of those files, i do not understand why certain files were kept confidential
 prah kya filon ko saarvajanik karne se aapke pita kii maut ko lekar chal rahaa vivaad khatm ho jayega?uh isse vivaad to khatm nahin hoga kyonki aap kitne bhi sakshya laakar saamne rakh den, lekin kuch log un par yakeen hi nahin karenge
 All available evidence points to the fact that my father survived only a few hours after the plane crash
 meri samaj se to jin filon ko abhi saarvajanik kiya janaa baaki he, unase bhi koi naatakeey jaankaree saamne aane vaali nahin he
 But still let's see what more secrets are revealed
 prah japan main aapke pita kii asthiyon ko lekar chal rahe vivaad kaa kya hoga?uh main nijee taur par yah mahasoos karti hum ki unka diene pareekshan kiya janaa chahie
 Nowadays, DNA technology has become so advanced that it is possible to tell whose bones are those
 kam se kam taarkik logon ke liye to isse is masale par viraam lag jayega or ve ise sweekaar kar lenge (ki ye asthiyaan netaji kii hai), khaas taur par mere parivaar ke log
 The priests of the temple would not agree to this without the permission of both India and Japan governments
 diene pareekshan kii baat justise mukherjee kamishan ne bhi kahi thi
 And then, even if those bones are not of Netaji, it does not prove that the plane crash did not happen
 prah kai shodhakarta kehete hai netaji bharat main sadhu banakar rahe the?uh main gumnami baba ko lekar is bakawaas main vishwaas nahin karti
 If my father was not in touch with his family members then why would he have come to India? Justice Mukherjee Commission also concluded that Gumnami Baba was not Netaji
 prah koi aise sawaal hai, jinke jawaab abhi tak aapako nahin mili hai?uh haa, kuch baaten hai jinako jaanane main meri bahut ruchi he

 Sai (sports Authority Center) in Bhiwani (haryana) is where 'star Vijender' was born
 yaheen se unhone boxing sikhi or aaj duniyabar ke mukkebaaz unke naam se khauf khate hai
 Vijender has been the star of Bhiwani's Sports Authority Center since no one knew him internationally
 unke peeche chalane vaale yuva, jo in dinon koching le rahe hai, vijender par garv mahasoos karte hai
 Recently 37 boxers are taking trains in Sai
 sabhi usee raah par chalanaa chaahate hai, jis par unke senior vijender singh chale or naam kamaaya
 Two of the 37, Sandeep Bhati and Neeraj Kumar Singhal, live in the same room (number 21), where Olympic medalist Vijender Singh lived for 8 years
 vijender ko lekar kya sochate hai uske gaanv walesandip ne junior world championships main silver medal jeeta he to niraj do baar junior neshnal champion rah chukaa he
 Vijender is an icon for all the boxers training here including both
 lekin haal hi main vijender singh par ai afat ne boxing kii is peedi ko dukhi kar diya he
 He feels that boxer as well as the image of this center (sai, Bhiwani) is at stake with the news of Vijender's association with drug smugglers
 haalanki unhen is baat kaa puraa bharosa he ki vijender nirdosh hai or ve jald hi is keechad se baahar nikal aaenge
 Neeraj told, 'all the boxers living here consider Vijender Bhai as their ideal
 hamen is baat par bhi garv hota he ki ham usee centre kaa hissaa hai, jahaan kabhi vijender ne training lee thi
 But it is also important that Vijender Bhai come forward with the truth and prove that all the allegations against him are false
 main aashaa karata hum ki vah nirdosh sabit honge, nahin to bharat main boxing kaa upar uth rahe graph par bura asar padegaa or is training centre kaa naam bhi kharaab hoga
 'all boxers are desperately waiting for Vijender to say something in this matter
 19 varshiya sandip isi saal senior category main shift hue hai
 Sandeep shares memories of his days when he came to the center new and Vijender was a rising star
 sandip ne kaha, '7-8 saal pehle jab maine yahaan jwine kiya tha, tab vijender yahaan star the
 i have never seen him smoking or drinking alcohol or breaking any rules
 vijender par lage aarope jhuthe hai
 But the world needs proof and if Vijender Singh has not really done anything, he should prove it
 'vijender singh ke saath ek hi kamare main rahe unke dost manish bharadwaj ne kaha ki vijender kah chuke hai ki ve nadaa (NADA) yaa wada (WADA) kisi bhi test se guzarane ko taiyaar hai
 If Vijender had done something wrong, he would not have said this
 manish bhi neshnal level ke mukkebaaz rah chuke hai
 Manish says that he will prove himself innocent
 manish bharadwaj yah bhi kehete hai ki maine vijender ke saath room share kiya he or maine use kabhi nasha karte nahin dekha
 But even then they should go through all the tests, so that the image of the game is not hit
 is train centre ke prashaasak (admin) brishabhaan ne vijender ko shuru se ab tak dekha he ki ve kaise saadhaaran se star hue
 He is also the admin and wrestling coach of the center since 2007
 unka kahana he ki vijender se judi khabar centre ke logon ke liye bada jhatka thi
 We still believe that Vijender cannot be linked to any drugs mafia
 har koi vijender singh ke bhavishya kii ore dekh rahaa he
 The people of the center believe that the boxing image has definitely got a punch with this development

 isiilie bijepi ne ek aisa daanv chalane kii taiyaari kii he, jisase pichley das saal se satta vaali emsidi uske haath se na phisal paae
 bjp's MCD formuladilli According to bjp's formula, the party will field with brand new and young faces
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwariko apni is yojana ke liye haikaman se hari jhandi bhi mil gai he
 According to Manoj Tiwari, the party will select good candidates, who will not only work at the grassroots level, but their ground report should also be fine
 tiwari ke mutabik nae chehron se emsidi ke kaamkaaj main nai urja or utsaah laayaa ja sake, isiilie ye faisla kiya gaya he
 However, according to sources, the real reason behind this decision is something else
 pehali to ye ki pichley das saal se emsidi main bijepi kabiz he
 To weaken the anti-incumbency wave, BJP wants to remove its old councilors from the ground
 taaki nae chehron ke saath party nai yojanaon or nae vaadon ko lekar janata ke bich ja sake
 The second big reason is also related to this and that the Aam Aadmi Party, which is in the Delhi government, has been making the issue of the lack of corruption and corruption in the MCD
 emsidi chunaav main bhi uskaa focus isi baat par rahane vaala he
 So that the issue of anti-incumbency can be redeemed
 aise main bijepi puraane parshadon ke tikat kaategi, to use nae or yuva chehron ke jariye votaron ko lubhaane kaa mauka mil jayega
 Along with this, according to sources, the party can also ban the giving of tickets to close relatives of the current councilors
 dilli main april maheene main hi emsidi ke chunaav honge or ab chunaavon kaa elaan kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, bjp's decision to completely replace the current councilors is not only a big political move, but can also be risky
 aisa isile, kyonki agar bijepi ye formula lagu karti he, to emsidi kii siyasat main saalon se sakriy kai diggaj netaaon ke raste band ho jaaenge
 It is obvious that the party has decided, but it also poses a danger of internal arrogance

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) January 23, 2019 team anna ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sarkaar ne rajyasabha main hue naatak ko rachaa kyonki uski manshaa ek majboot bhrashtachar virdohi sanstha banane kii nahin thi
 Arvind Kejriwal, a member of Team Anna, said, "the manner in which the polling was avoided in the Rajya Sabha proves that the government is cheating one after the other
 unka kahana he ki vah ek majboot lokapal vidheyak pesh karnaa chaahate hai, lekin unki aisi manshaa nahin he
 'anna Hazare's supporters said that if the government had accepted the three amendments, it could have passed the bill
 ye teen sanshodhan hai- sibiai kii swatantraaa, chunane va hataane kii prakriya or lokayukta ko alag karnaa
 Kejriwal said that the bill introduced in the House was not only weak but also 'dangerous', because the Lokpal was completely under the control of the government
 kejariwal ne kaha, ‘yah ek matboot lokapal kii shuruyaat ho sakati thi
 Another member of the team, Prashant Bhushan, said, "now the fight will be to save democracy
" ’ udhar, kejariwal ne kaha, ‘televijan channelon ne din kii khabaron main bataaya tha ki rajd sadsy aadchan paidaa karenge or kaarywahi ko der raat tak kheechenge, taaki vidheyak par charchaa nahin ho sake
 The script of what happened in the Rajya Sabha was written outside the House
 kuch logon ne bilkul iske anusaar kaam kiya
 
 yah sansad main match phixing kaa spasht maamla tha
 ' prashanth ne kaha, ‘kaarywahi baadhit karne, vidheyak ko hataane or vidheyak paarit kiye bagaiyr sabhi logon kaa ghar janaa sunishchit karne ke liye logon ko niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Another member of the team, Shanti Bhushan, said that the opposition had been unanimous on the three amendments
 unhone kaha ki sadan ke andar loktantr kii ‘hatya’ ke vakt pradhanmantri bhi vahaan maujuud the
 The government said on Monday that it did not give anyone the right to tap the phone of a political leader and, in an investigation into allegations made in a report published in a magazine about this, they had no confirmation
 vipaksh ke baari hangaame ke bich grih mantri pi chidambaram ne loksabhaa main prashnkaal ke baad die ek bayaan main kaha, ‘main spasht rup se yah kahana chahta hum ki purvavarti samprag sarkaar dwaara kisi bhi raajnneetik netaa ke telephone ko na to tap kiya gaya or na hi unki baatcheet suni gayi
 The current UPA government also did not authorize any such activity
 ’unhone kaha, ‘23 april 2010 ko patrika ke uplabdh ank main prakashit ek report main lagaae gaye aaropon kii vyapak jaanch kii gayi
 These allegations have not been confirmed in the records of the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), or elsewhere
 ’ chidambaram ke bayaan ke dauraan sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan de rahe sapa or rajd ke sadasyon sahit sampurna vipaksh kathith phone tanping ke khilaaf narebaaji karata rahaa or is bare main grih mantri kii jagah pradhanmantri se bayaan kii maang karata rahaa
 In a report published in Outlook magazine, allegations have been made of tapping the phones of some leaders including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI-M leader Prakash Karat and Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 chidambaram ne kaha ki sarkaar ne patrika ke is teen may ke ank main prakashit report main antiaro ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon ko dekha he
 He said, 'the allegations leveled in the magazine are being investigated further
 agar koi saboot saamne aayaa to maamle kii uchit agenciyon dwaara vyapak jaanch karaayi jaaegi
 "he said," Our intelligence agencies operate within the law
 vah puri tarah sarkaar ke prati javabdeh hai
 Under the Telegraph Act and the Information Technology Act, personal approval from the Union Home Secretary has to be obtained in every case that is monitored over telephone or electronic communication and the monitoring committee headed by the Cabinet Secretary reviews it
 aparaadh se ladane, rashtriya suraksha ke liye yaa aatankwaad virdohi hamaare prayaason ke liye is tarah kii nigaraanee yadi aavashyak hoti he to us par bhi kai str par niyantran or nigaraanee rakhi jaati he
 The Home Minister said, "both the previous and present governments of the UPA have respected the laws of the country in this regard
 ham prayek bhartiya naagarik ke adhikaron kii raksha karne, jisamen unki niztaa kaa adhikaar bhi shaamil he, ke liye patibaddh hai
 We will respect the individual rights of citizens in the Indian Constitution
 ’is bich, vipakshi sadsy grih mantri ke bajaay pradhanmantri se is bare main bayaan dene kii maang par ade rahe or kai partiyon ke sadsy asana ke samaksh aakar is bare main narebaaji bhi karte rahe
 Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee said that he has approached the Prime Minister respecting the demand of senior BJP leader LK Advani regarding this and he is ready to give a statement in this regard at 3:30 pm in the House
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri chunki afghanistan ke raashtrapati ke saath abhi baatcheet main vyast hai or unke saath dopaher ko hone vaale bhoj ke baad vah is bare main sadan main aakar bayaan dene ko raji hai
 Mukherjee said that if the opposition members agree on this then it is okay otherwise the Home Minister is ready to give a statement in this regard
 rajd or sapa sahit vipakshi sadsy is par sahamat nahin hue or hangaamaa thamate na na dekh adhyaksh mira kumaar ne chidambaram ke bayaan ke kuch minute baad sadan kii baithak do baje tak sthagit kar di
 Earlier in the morning the matter arose when the House met and the senior BJP leader LK Advani demanded a statement from the Prime Minister, calling it a very serious matter
 hangaame ke kaaran kareeb 15 minute baad hi baithak dopaher 12 baje tak sthagit kar di gayi thi

 '' dilli kii ek adaalat ne kaha he ki check jaise madhyam kii vishwasaneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye jaruri he ki check bouns ke maamalon main aisi sajaa di jaae, jo misaal kaayam kare
 The court made this remark while retaining the eight-month imprisonment of a person
 is vyakti ko ek magistrate adaalat ne yah bhi nirdesh diya ki vah check bouns ke maamle main shikayatakarta ko 20 lakh rupye kaa muaavja bhi de
 The comments atirikt satr nyaayadhish pulastya parmachal ne magistrate ke aadesh ke khilaaf is vyakti kii ore se daayar apil ko khaarij kar diya
 He agreed with the lower court that he wanted to take strong measures to set precedent against incidents of check bounce
 jaj ne kaha, 'check jaise madhyamon, jo ki kisi tarah ke lenden main kisi vyakti ke dainik jivan kaa hissaa hai, unki vishwasaneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye, misaali sajaa di jani chahie
 Therefore, i do not see any wrong in imprisonment
 is tarah, vyakti kii apil main koi dam nahin dikhataa or ise khaarij kiya jaataa he
 The court upheld the sentence of imprisonment and the amount of compensation, saying that the compensation of 20 lakhs was double the amount for which the check was issued on 30 September 2010
 lagbhag saat saal kharaab ho chuke hai, isliye muaavje kii raashi vaazib he
 Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Paramchal dismissed the appeal filed by the man against the magistrate's order
 unhone nichali adaalat ke saath sahmati jataai ki vah check bouns hone kii ghatnaon ke khilaaf misaal kaayam karne ke liye majboot upaay karnaa chaahate hai
 The judge said, "to ensure the credibility of mediums like checks, which are part of a person's daily life in some type of transaction, Misali should be punished
" isliye mujhe kaid kii sajaa main bhi koi gadabad najar nahin aati
 In this way, the person's appeal does not show any merit and is dismissed
 ' adaalat ne kaid kii sajaa or muaavje kii raashi ko barkaraar rakhte hue kaha ki 30 sitambar 2010 ko jis raashi kaa check jari kiya gaya tha, 20 lakh kaa muaavja uskaa duguna he
 Nearly seven years have gone bad, so the compensation amount is reasonable
 jaj ne kaha, 'check jaise madhyamon, jo ki kisi tarah ke lenden main kisi vyakti ke dainik jivan kaa hissaa hai, unki vishwasaneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye, misaali sajaa di jani chahie
 Therefore, i do not see any wrong in imprisonment
