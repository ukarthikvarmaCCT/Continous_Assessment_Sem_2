 In the eyes of them all, Dawn with a slim 5-foot-5-inch thin body and trademark mustache was like a fearless Robinhood; Whereas in reality he used to keep a check to hide himself for fear of being arrested or even more likely to be killed in an encounter

 "gawli's friendship with the Shiv Sena came to an end when he killed Thackeray's aide Jayant Jadhav and Shiv Sena MLA Ramesh More in 1996
 jaahir taur par isliye kyonki thakare uski andekhi kar rahe the
 Even Jadhav's killers put a call to Gawli from his mobile phone, so that he could hear the sound of gunfire

 Suicide bombers entered the Army School of Peshawar in Pakistan, and made a hundred and fifty children die
 is hamale ne pakistan ko hi nahin, puri duniya ko jhakzor daalaa he
 The incident is widely condemned, but are terrorists, or even Pakistan itself, responsible for the biggest terrorist attack on any school in Pakistani history
 
 
 ? Today's human is not so much saddened by his grief as it is by seeing the happiness of others, and this is fully applicable to Pakistan
 jab se pakistan bana he, use bharat kii shanti or tarakkee raas nahin aa rahi
 Pakistan is bent on disturbing the peace of India by promoting terrorism in Punjab, sometimes in Kashmir
 
 
 vahi haal he ki apana ghar kabhi sanbhala nahin, lekin paraaye ghar main dakhsandaazi zaruri he
 
 
 In the year 2010, the then President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari admitted that Pakistan had created and sheltered terrorists to fulfill some objectives
 pichley maheene wagha seemaa ke kareeb 55 logon kii jaan lene vaale bam dhamaake, or ab peshawar ke skool main hua hamalaa isi baat kaa saboot he ki 'bhasmasur' ab banane vaale ko hi khatm karne par amada ho gaya he
 According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, Pakistan has 12 domestic terrorist organizations, and has sheltered 32 international terrorist organizations
 varsh 2002 se lekar ab tak pakistan main 405 aatmghaatee hamale hue hai, jinamein 6,120 log maare ja chuke hai or 12,791 ghayal hue hai
 Now Pakistan has to understand where the mango tree was sown, where to get mangoes
 yahaan ek baat or haasyaaspad lagati he ki pakistan ne apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se aatankwaad kii vyakhya kii hui he - acha aatankwaad, bura aatankwaad
 
 
 Those who attack in India are freedom fighters (jihadis) for Pakistan, and those who attack Pakistan are terrorists
 ab jo pakistan ke anusaar aatankwaadi hai, unke khilaaf usne kai abhiyaan ched rakhe hai
 The attack in Peshawar today is a response to one of those campaigns
 hamale kii jimmedaar taharik-e-taliban ke anusaar, usne paak sena dwaara uttari wajiristaan main chal rahe oparation 'zarb-e-azab' kaa badla liya he
 It is noteworthy that 1,858 Taliban have been killed in this military operation going on for the last six months
 lekin duusari ore, pakistan 26 november ke mukhya aaropee hafiz said or daaud ibrahim jaise un aatankwaadiyon ke liye special train chalaata he, or unhen ghar main rakhkar viipi treetment detaa he, jo bharat main 'most wonted' hai
 
 
 Pakistan keeps talking to Kashmiri separatists and provoking them against India
 phir bhi dekhne vaali baat yah he ki pakistan kii itani koshishon ke baavjood kashmir kaa haal pakistan jitna bura nahin hua he
 The Kashmiri separatists who keep calling India and the Indian Army bad and do not get tired of praising Pakistan, are they unaware of the fact that it is due to the efforts of the Indian Army that Kashmir is saved from becoming hell
 varanaa vah bhi barbaadi kii kagaar par pahunch gaya hota
 Whenever there is a disaster on Kashmir, the Indian Army stands as a shield
 vah bhartiya sena hi thi, jisane baadh main logon ke jaan-maal kii raksha kii
 There was also a news in the middle that the troops of the army which had saved the people were stoned and some soldiers were also attacked
 peshawar ke schuli hamale main jo bachche maare gaye hai, kya pakistan unke maa-baap kaa dard samaj paaegaa
 
 
 The Will Pakistan still not take lessons and change its dual policy towards terrorism? 
 
 ? or bharat main jo log sirf dharm ke aadhaar par apane aapako pakistan se judaa samajhate hai, gharon main pakistan kaa jhanda lagaate hai or pakistan team ke liye chiyar karte hai, kya ve apane bhavishya kaa aisa haal dekhnaa pasand karenge
 
 
 The khabar to pakki he
 Only the formality of an official statement remains
 nitish kumaar phir sebihar siem kii kursi sanbhaalane vaale hai
 Then what is the wait? Of Delhi election results
 ji haa, dilli ke nateezon kaa bihar kii satta par sidhaa asar hone vaala he
 Delhi has elections on 7 February and the results will come on 10 February
 15 farvari ko patna ke gandhi maidan main jediu kii raily he
 JDU is in power in Bihar and currently Jitan Ram Manjhi is the Chief Minister
 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi kaa bhi daawa he ki 15 farvari tak jeethanram maanjhi ko mukhyamantri pad se hataakar nitish kumaar phir se siem ban sakate hai
 Sushil Modi's statement may be political, but seems quite accurate
 halaat to yahi sanket de rahe hai
 Keeping an eye on the Delhi results, Aishtesh is constantly making statements in support of Arvind Kejriwal
 aisa lagata he jaise dilli main bijepi kii sarkaar nahin ban paane kii sthiti main kejariwal or congress se kahin zyada bihar main baithe nitish kumaar ko sabase zyada khushi hogi
 This is what his recent expressions are saying
 to kya dilli ke nattejey modi lahar ke damakham ke saboot honge
 Not entirely, it can be considered to a great extent
 pratyaksh taur par bhale na sahi, par ye charchaa to ye thi hi ki nitish ne modi ke chalate hi bihar ke siem kii kursi chodi thi
 Manjijitan Ram Manjhi, who is running unbridled, was told to be remote control of Nitish Kumar when he took oath as Chief Minister
 jaise jaise din bitate gaye unke tevar badalte gaye
 Like a disenchanted player in politics, Manjhi Nitish began to hide the policies of governance, his favorite officials and even many of his dream projects
 maanjhi ne nitish kumaar ke sabase chahete afasar ko chalata kar diya
 It is believed that all of Nitish's dream projects were run under his supervision
 kehete hai ki nitish ko chhodkar us afasar ko na to koi netaa pasand karata he or na hi koi afasar
 Manjhi took full advantage of it
 ek hi tir se unhone tamaam nishane saadh liye
 It is discussed that some more such officers are on Manjhi's target
 duusari taraf maanjhi ne naukarshahi main apane logon ko tarjeeh dena shuru kiya
 In this way, he also began to establish himself as the great leader of the Mahadalits
 unke kai bayaan isaki misaal bhi hai - or pramaan bhi
 Why should anyone eat the fruit? NDA government was formed in Bihar with great difficulty
 phir nitish ne ji jaan laga kar sushasan babu kaa tamgaa hasil kiya
 Time changed, things changed and Nitish broke with the BJP
 itnaa hi nahin, jiske bare main baat karnaa manjuur nahin tha usase unhen gale tak milanaa padaa
 Now Nitish feels that if the door is loose, then Lalu Prasad Yadav will leave no stone unturned to trap him
 isi saal oktober-november tak vidhaan sabha ke chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, Lalu gives a lot of air to Manjhi's antics
 ye baat bhi nitish samaj chuke hai
 The BJP is in the process of putting a different hurdle
 dilli to kab kii dur ho chuki he, patna bhi pakad main nahin aa sakegaa – agar apane begaane ho gaye
 Nitish has become alert so that it does not get late
 par kya maanjhi ko nitish aasaani se manaa lenge? ye itnaa aasaan to nahin lagata
 Manjhi wants to see a Mahadalit as the next Chief Minister
 bhale uskaa naam kuch bhi ho
 And that name is not Nitish Kumar

 ve ek lambii saanskrithik viraasat kii kadi the kyonki ve sufi (hazrat osman haruni) or lekhakon-kaviyon ke khandaan se taalluk rakhte the
 Majaz had a romantic attitude towards Pyaar, Arzoo and the world, although his desire was to bring about revolutionary reforms / social changes, especially in the role of women
 majaaz ne 'mazdooron kaa geet' likhaa or usamen unki aatma ko jagaaya (dekhie kaise: 'mehnat se ye mana chur hai ham / aaraam se koson dur hai ham

 In the same year, the Supreme Court redefined medical negligence with new things in it - overdose of medicine, not telling the patient about the side effects of the medicine, not paying extra attention for diseases with high mortality and on behalf of the hospital Not providing basic facilities to the patient — also added, as in the case of Anuradha Saha

 These are the words that, upon hearing, a picture of a fallen person flashes in the mind, certainly these words cannot have anything to do with any saint, saint, priest and Baba
 lekin is duniya ke kuch aise baba hai, jo havas or ranginiyon main is kadar duube ki unki karatootein dekhakar or sunakar vishwaas kii najuk door se bandhe haath khul gaye or ab aise besharm baabaaon kii is lambii pherarist main ek or naam baba paramanand kaa jud gaya he
 The shameless act of Babas: Actually this country belongs to Baba, from the treasure of crores to the hearts and minds of a large population is occupied by these Babas
 baba ishaara karte nahin ki duniya charnon main lot jaati he
 Wealth, dignity, fame, honor, dignity, sensation and everything are at Baba's footsteps and Baba is taking advantage of this kind of innocence of his devotees and feeding them more than one
 koi naach rahaa he, koi nagin dance kar rahaa he, koi ladakiyon ke saath jhule jhul rahaa he to koi bistar par apni shishyaa ke saath atakheliyaan kar rahaa he, iske alaava koi swimming pool main ladakiyon ke saath nahaane kaa lutf uthaa rahaa he
 The shameful acts of these Baba's street raids and blasphemous acts continue
 kyonki bhakton ko apane bhagwaan par yakeen he jisaki vajah se wo in paakhandee logon tak khinche chale aate hai
 Baba Parmanand was arrested by the police, but these new gods of the new age have blown away the truth that lies are lying

 But here all of them are Baba

 By chance, Baba too laid his hands on the aching veil of his devotees and claimed to have charismatic power in the matter of procuring children
 dharm-karm kii baton ke bich bhagava chole ne logon kii nigahon par aisa pardaa daalaa ki ab log aankh moond kar un par yakeen karne lage or is paakhandee baba ko isi maukey kaa intjaar tha
 He used to meet the women in the room alone, now he would call the women who wanted Aulad and son in the room alone
 unke saath jyaadati karata or kamare main lage chupe hue camaron se uski video bana letaa, phir jaise hi ye mahilaayein ek baar uske jaal main funs jaati, phir to baba inhen videos ke zarie unhen blackmel karnaa shuru kar detaa, kabhi rupee-paison ke liye blackmel to kabhi apni gandi jehniyat ke liye blackmel, lekin kehete hai naa ki jab paap kaa gadaa bharta he, to foot bhi jaataa he to ek roj is baba ke paap kaa gadaa bhi achaanak foot gaya or wo bhi kuch aise, jaise koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha

 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko lekar puure desh main lag rahe 'har-har modi' naare par jyotishpeethadhishwar, jagadguru shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne etraj jataayaa he
 Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati said that giving the slogan of Har Har Har Modi like Har Har Har Mahadev is against the Sanatan tradition
 mahadev bhagwaan hai or modi insaan
 In this way man is being promoted equal to God
 yah kisi bhi surat main sweekaarya nahin he
 Saraswati further said that he is not opposed to Modi, but Modi has also come to his ashram, but the slogan being given is against Hindu belief and faith
 shankaracharya se jude logon kaa kahana he ki swami swaroopanand ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ko bhi apni is bhaavana se avgat kara diya he
 Two undertrials tried to escape from Tihar Jail, considered Asia's safest prison
 ek pakadaa gaya to ek bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa
 This way of escaping from film style has destroyed the security in Tihar
 tihaad main kaidiyon ke bhaagane kii ye teesri ghatana he
 Earlier, Charles Sobhraj, Sher Singh Rana and 16 under consideration have escaped in separate incidents
 14 hajaar se zyada kaidiyon vaali tihaad jail main shanivaar kii shaam jail number saat main kaidiyon kii ginati hui to pataa chalaa ki javed or faijan naam ke do kaidi gaayab hai
 Faizan was caught in a while, but Javed absconded, according to officials, something like this happened
 tippaniyan Such escaped prisoner - 21 kaidiyon ke saath rojaa ward main band javed or faijan pehle jail number 7 kii 13 feet oonchi diwaar koode
 - Then another wall about 12 feet high
 - phir 16 feet oonchi or 2 feet moti teesri diwaar main suraakh kiya
 - After leaving here, crossed another wall about 13 feet high
 - or phir jail ke naale main aakhri jump maari
 Faizan was injured and caught by falling into a drain
 - jabaki keechad main sanaa javed bhaag gaya
 According to Tihar Jail Spokesperson Mukesh Kumar, the Superintendent of Jail No
 2 has been entrusted with the investigation in the matter and has been asked to submit a report in 2 days
 hairaani ye bhi he ki tihaad prashasan ne police main 24 ghante baad maamla darj karaayaa gaya
 Now the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has also conducted an investigation on its behalf
 dilli ke grahamantri satyendra jain kaa kahana he ki is maamle main doshi logon par bahut sakht kaarywai kii jaayegi
 According to the police, Javed and Faizan have cases of burglary, which is why they specialize in building tunnels or tearing walls
 isse pehle alag-alag ghatnaon main charles shobhraj, sher singh rana or 16 vichaaradhin bhaag chuke hai
 In Tihar Jail with more than 14 thousand prisoners, the number of prisoners in Jail number seven on Saturday evening was counted, it was found that two prisoners named Javed and Faizan were missing
 thodi der main faijan to pakadaa gaya lekin javed faraar ho gaya adhikariyon ke mutabik ghatana kuch aise hui
 The comments aise bhaaga kaidi Javed and Faizan, locked in Rosa ward with 21 prisoners, first jumped 13 feet high wall of jail no
7
 - uske baad kareeb 12 feet oonchi ek or diwaar faandi
 - Then hole 16 feet high and 2 feet thick in the third wall
 - yahaan se nikalne ke baad kareeb 13 feet oonchi ek or diwaar paar kii
 - And then the last jump in the prison drain
 - naale main girakar faijan jakhmi hua or pakadaa gaya
 - While Sana Javed ran into the mud
 tihaad jail ke pravaktaa mukesh kumaar ke mutabik jail number 2 ke supretendent ko is maamle kii jaanch saunpi gayi he or 2 din main unhen report dene ke liye kaha gaya he
 It is also surprising that the Tihar administration registered a case with the police 24 hours later

 Delhi's Home Minister Satyendra Jain says that very strict action will be taken against those guilty in this case

 Rahul Gandhi claimed that it is not right to talk about Paytm in the name of cashless economy

 The comments unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa notebandi kaa faisla 'bold' nahin, 'bekaar' faisla he, jise lene se pehle kisi se koi salaah-mashvira nahin kiya gaya, or kisi parinaam ke bare me sochaa hi nahin gaya
 Jyotiraditya Scindia of Congress and Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal United also appeared among the opposition leaders along with Rahul Gandhi during the protest

 The Congress on Tuesday turned to the Election Commission regarding BJP President Amit Shah's statement about its manifesto related to the Telangana Assembly elections

 a party delegation met the Election Commission, besides issuing notices to Shah on complaints related to evms in Madhya Pradesh, the arrest of Telangana Congress Committee Working President Revanth Reddy and the acting Chief Minister of Telangana

 After meeting the Election Commission, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said that Amit Shah had made a misinformation about the Congress manifesto in Telangana

 Raising the issue of precautionary arrest of Revanth Reddy in the case of allegedly threatening Chandrasekhar Rao, Sibal said that all this has been done during the election and the commission should take cognizance of it
 madhya pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh kamalnath ne kaha ki rajya se iviem ko lekar bahut shikaayatein aa rahi hai ki adhikari gadabadi kar rahe hai

 shah ne ye daawa telugana ke rangareddy jile ke aamangal main raily main bolte hue kiya
 For the Congress, Amit Shah said, "friends, they have promised to forgive the power of the mosque and the church, i ask them what is the fault of the temple, why won't you forgive the power of the temples, only you will do the mosque and the church

 fasebuk data li ke baad se company kii mushkilen kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 An internal memo from Andrew Bosworth, now close to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a top executive of the company, has surfaced, stating that we want growth at any cost
 bajfid kii report main fasebuk ke internal memo kii baat kii gai he, jisamen fasebuk ke vaais president andryu basworth ne kaha he, ‘ham logon ko conect karte hai, isliye jo bhi kaam ham apane growth ke liye karte hai wo nyaaysangat yani sahi he
 Whether it is the language that connects each other and makes people worth finding
 wo sabhi kaam jo zyada communication laane ke liye kiye jate hai
 The work that we will ever do in China

 If people make it negative then it is bad
 shaayad yah kisi kii jaan bhi le saktaa he’unhone yah bhi likhaa he, ‘hamaare tuls kii vajah se shaayad aatanki hamale main koi maaraa bhi ja saktaa he’bajfid ke mutabik is internal memo kaa naam ‘the Ugly’ he
 This memo is dated 18 June 2016
 is memo main likhi gayi wo baaten jo aapako janani chahie-- ham logon ko ek duusare se conect karte hai- agar log ise sakaaratmak banaate hai to yah acchhee baat he
 People can probably find love here
 shaayad yah jaan bhi bachaa saktaa he
 So we connect people
 - agar log ise nakaaratmak banaate hai to yah bura he
 Perhaps it can endanger the lives of others by exposing them to the wrong antics
 shaayad hamaare tuls kii vajah se koi aatanki hamale main apni jaan bhi ganvaa saktaa he- bura sach ye he ki ham logon ko conect karne main itnaa zyada yakeen rakhte hai ki iske liye hamen jo bhi karnaa hoga, wo vastav main acha hi hoga
 One thing comes out of this memo which is quite dangerous and that is that Facebook can go to any extent to connect people

 Rahul Gandhi is going to be our new leader
 pranab ke bayaan ko tab bahut mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he jab congress netaaon ne rahul gandhi ko bhavishya kaa netaa or bhavi pradhanmantri ke rup main samarthan kiya he
 During the Durga Puja celebrations at his ancestral residence in Virbhum district, he said, what the BJP is doing is its internal matter
 pranab ne vibhinn rajyon main haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ke pradarshan par bhi prashn khadaa kiya

 There is no possibility of the Election Commission banning the broadcast and publication of pre-poll survey for the Lok Sabha elections to be held in the coming month as the Commission has told the Law Ministry that it does not want to take such a step by using the authority obtained under the Constitution And he wants the government to enact laws on this issue
 kuch samay pehle hi vidhi mantralay ne chunaav ayog ko suzav diya tha ki vah anuchhed 324 ke tahat apni shaktion kaa upyog karte huu chunaav purv surveykshan par roak laga saktaa he
 The Commission responded to this by telling the government that it would be a better idea to enact a law in this regard
 chunaav ayog ko lagata he ki anuchhed 324 ke tahat chunaav purv surveykshan ko pratibandhit karnaa kanoonee taur par banaaye rakhane yogya nahin hoga
 The Commission told the Law Ministry that since exit poll is prohibited under the law, a similar procedure should be adopted regarding pre-election survey
 chunaav ayog ne prastaav kiya he ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav kii adhisuchana ke baad chunaav shuru hone se antim charan kaa matdaan puraa hone tak chunaav surveykshan kaa prasaaran or prakaashan pratibandhit hona chahie
 Under the current law, the Election Commission is allowed to restrict pre-election survey 48 hours before the vote

 While the rules were suddenly changed, the tender was issued to the Italian company in 2009

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is not in the mood to withdraw his resignation from the post of President even after all the man-pleas
 rahul ke istipha die hue kareeb dedh maheene hone ja rahaa he, lekin abhi tak unke vikalp kii talash puri nahin ho saki he
 This is the reason why Rahul has made it clear on Wednesday that the party should have an election for the post of president at the earliest, he is no longer in this position
 nae adhyaksh ke liye ek maheene kii ded line bhi tay kar di he
 Whereas, the BJP, led by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, has returned to power after registering a major victory

 congress varking cameti seedblusi kii kai baithken hone ke baad bhi rahul kii jagah adhyaksh pad ke liye kisi duusare netaa kii talash puri nahin ho saki he
 While all the names including Congress's Sushil Kumar Shinde, Ashok Gehlot, Mallikarjun Kharge, AK Antony came in the discussion, but no one has been confirmed yet
 jabaki loksabhaa chunaav main prachand jeet ke saath duusari baar satta main aane ke baad hi bijepi ne adhyaksh kaa faisla kar liya he
 The decision was taken by the party when Amit Shah was given the responsibility of the Union Home Ministry in the Modi government
 aise main unhone party adhyaksh kaa pad kisi anya vyakti ko die jane kii baat kahi thi
 It was only after this that the meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Board approved the appointment of JP Nadda as the Executive Chairman
 haalanki amit shah ne adhyaksh pad se istipha nahin diya he
 In such a situation, it is believed that Amit Shah will remain the national president of the party for the next 6 months
 amit shah ke saath milakar hi jepi nadda party kaa kaam kaaj dekhenge
 In this way, the BJP has two presidents and the Congress president is seen devoid of it

 aise vimaanon kii vajah se kitne payalton kii durbhagyapurna maut tak ho chuki he
 Pilot Meet Kumar, who lost his life in an accident in Kangra in Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, flew with one such aircraft which was supposed to be 'decommissioned' from duty, which should have been taken out of service
 maut se kuch minute pehle wing commander meet kumaar ne radio par pathankot air base ke air trephic control (ATC) se sampark kiya tha or tatkaal waapas aane kii ijaajat maangi thi
 Wing Commander Kumar, about 12 from Pathankot Airbase
 20 baje udaan bhari thi or kuch samay baad hi unka mig vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 He flew with Type 75 mig-21 aircraft, considered to be the second oldest fighter aircraft of the Air Force
 'oh, sab kuch thik he na sar?' atisi ne wing commander se poocha, yah jaanane ke liye ki ladaaku vimaan kaa sanchaalan thik se ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 The aircraft was recently serviced after about 200 hours of flight
 kumaar 'first air test shorty' se udaan bhar rahe the jise saamaanya oparational udaan ke liye hi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Such aircraft are usually flown by experienced pilots only
 wing commander kumaar ko mig 21 vimaanon ko udaane kaa 800 ghante kaa anubhav he
 The Wing Commander responded to ATC that weather standards are not suitable for 'first Air Test Shorty' due to clouds
 atisi ne unhen tatkaal landing kii ijaajat de di, lekin mig 21 vimaan radar se gaayab ho chukaa tha
 Within a few minutes, the fears of 26 Squadron of the Indian Air Force of Pathankot base came true, the aircraft had crashed
 is maamle main jaanch ke aadesh to die ja chuke hai ki durghatana or wing commander kumaar kii maut kaise hui
 Only after investigation will be able to confirm what was the reason
 lekin do chijen gaur karne kii hai
 Both the Auto Pilot of the Type 75 mig-21 aircraft and Wing Commander Kumar's experience of flying hours are considered the best
 gauratlab he kibadalon kii sthiti mempailat vimaan ko auto payalat mod main daal dete hai
 But the real thing is that Type 75 mig-21 aircraft should have been decommissioned a year ago

 Significantly, the Air Force has 9 Tejas fighter aircraft, but none of them have been approved for operational flight yet
 dukhad yah he ki abhi vaayu sena tip-75 mig 21 vimaanon kaa istemaal kuch or saal tak karti rahegi
 Actually, the Indian Air Force needs to deploy at least 42 squadron fighter jets to maintain its strength on the border, but if the Type-75 mig-21 aircraft are withdrawn from service, the Air Force will also have 30 squadrons
 Fewer combat aircraft will remain

 Farmers are protesting in four big states of the country regarding debt waiver
 madhyapradesh main kisaanon ke andolan ne hinsak rup le liya he
 6 farmers have died in police firing
 is bich ye sawaal uthne lage hai ki chunaav se pehle tamaam raajnneetik dal kisaanon kii karj maafee samet fasal ke sahi daam jaise vaade karte hai
 But after winning the elections, the problems of the farmers are forgotten
 hakeekat bhi darasal kuch aisi hi he
 Governments change, ruling parties change, but the picture of farmers' plight does not change
 is bich sawaal ye bhi he ki kya vaaki partiyon ko kisaanon kii karj maafee jaise vaadon se siyaasi phayda miltaa he?upi main bijepi ko mila phaaydaupi vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main bijepi ne kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa vaada kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself promised to forgive the debt of the farmers of the state in the election public meeting
 modi ne sidhe kisaanon ko sambodhit karte hue aahvaan kiya ki upi main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad pehali cabinet meeting main hi kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa faisla kiya jayega
 The effect of this appeal of Modi was seen in the election results
 upi main bijepi ko prachand bahumat hasil hua
 After the formation of the government, UP CM Yogi Adityanath fulfilled the promise made by PM Modi to the farmers and waived the loan of 36 thousand crores
 2009 main congress ko mila phaaydacongress ke netritv vaali upie sarkaar ne 2008 main deshbhar ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa faisla kiya
 Manmohan government waived 65 thousand crore debt of farmers
 manmohan sarkaar ke is bade faisle ko congress netaaon ne 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main jamkar bhunaaya
 The result was that once the Congress government was formed at the Center
 bijepi-inelo gathbandhan ko mili thi jeetakarjamaafee ke vaade ke saath haryana main bhi bijepi ko bada phayda mila tha
 The BJP and the Indian National Lok Dal contested the 1987 assembly election in an alliance
 gathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav se pehle karj maafee kaa naaraa diya
 As a result, the alliance won 76 out of 90 seats and formed a government under Devilal
 sarkaar ne kisaanon ke 25 hajaar rupee tak ke sahakaari bainkon ke karj maaf kiye
 Even though the BJP in UP, the Congress at the Center and the BJP-INLD alliance in Haryana have benefited from the promise of debt waiver
 lekin kai baar aisa bhi hua he jab partiyon ko niraashaa haath lagi
 Kejriwal's Failam Man Party in Punjab made many big promises to farmers in the 2017 assembly elections
 baqayada kisaanon ke liye moga main ghoshnaptr jari kiya gaya
 The manifesto promised to make all farmers debt free by 2018
 saath hi kisaanon ko 12 ghante muft bijli, fasal barbaad hone par 20 hajaar rupee prati acre muaavja or kaam na hone par kisaan mazdooron ko har maheene 10 hajaar rupye dene kaa vaada kiya
 All these promises of Arvind Kejriwal could not make his party reach the pinnacle of power in Punjab and the Congress Captain turned the tide of winds against the Badal government
 dilli ke kisaanon ko muaavja bhi nahin aayaa kampunjab main karjamaafee ke vaade se pehle mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke kisaanon ko sabase zyada muaavja dene kaa daawa kiya
 In 2015, Arvind Kejriwal gave a compensation of 20 thousand rupees per acre to farmers suffering 70 percent and above crop loss
 kejariwal ne sabase zyada muaavja dene kaa daawa kiya
 When the MCD elections were held in 2017, Kejriwal's party could not even gain power here and the BJP won all three mcds
 veepi singh ko bhi nahin mila phaaydasaal 1990 main pradhanmantri ve pi singh ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa nirnay kiya
 The then Central Government waived farmers loans up to Rs 10,000
 haalanki, kisaanon kii karj maafee ke faisle se centre sarkaar par 10,000 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj bhi padaa
 After this, in 1991, when the Lok Sabha elections were held, there was a change of power in the center and the Congress government was formed
 baharhaal, kabhi kisi party ko kisaanon ke muddon par phayda mila he, to kahin unke vaade unki naiyya paar lagane main naakaam sabit hue hai
 But the reality is that debt-ridden farmers are still committing suicide
 2011-15 tak 15 saalon main desh ke 2 lakh 34 hajaar 642 kisaanon aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 The parties and governments may claim to have their debts forgiven, but the farmers of the country still owe 12 lakh 60 thousand crores
 bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ne upi sarkaar par muaavje ko lekar dohari niti apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Making the Dadri violence case an issue, he said on Tuesday that there have been more incidents of violence in the state, but why the victims were not given financial help
 sakshi maharaj ne kaha, 'uttar pradesh main hinsa kii or bhi ghatnaayen hui hai

 aisi dohari niti kyon he?'upi menkanoon-vyavasthaapar prahaar karte hue unhone kaha ki jab sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav khud kehete hai ki rajya main kanoon-vyavastha nahin he, to unka aisa kahana anuchit kaise ho gaya
 Sakshi Maharaj also targeted Azam Khan, a SP leader and a minister in the state government
 unhone kaha, 'jis tarah se dadri kii ghatana kaa raajnneetikaran ho rahaa he, yah nindaneey he
 Now today Azam Khan is also going there

 congress mahasachiv shakeel ahamed ne twit kiya, ‘soshal media par bhaajapa netaa or gramin vikaas mantri munde kii badi uplabdhi kii baat ho rahi he

 They take leave to discuss plans with their children and go out on the mountains for a trekking holiday *** narendra modi mukhyamantri the to bijepi desh bhar main gujarat ke vikaas model kii duhai dete nahin thakti thi
 Riding on the chariot of this Gujarat development model, Narendra Modi conquered the throne of Delhi in 2014
 saath hi modi kaa kad itnaa bada ho gaya ki uski chaaya ke neeche puri bijepi hi dab kar rah gai
 It would be called a political irony that the development horse which had run for Modi in 2014 on the Rajpath was now being said in Gujarat for the same - 'vikas Gando Thayo Chhe' means 'vikas has gone mad'
 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle ‘vikaas gando thayo che’ kii gunj itani jor se sunai dene lagi ki modi ko khud hi gujarat main aakar kahana padaa- 'hum vikaas chhu, hum gujarat chhu' yani ‘main vikaas hum, main gujarat hum
 It was not even five months after Modi's coronation as Chief Minister in Gujarat that the state witnessed a terrible phase of violence after the Godhra incident in 2002
 yaheen se ‘hindutv’ kaa aisa jowar uthaa ki ‘modi yug’ ne majbootee se gujarat main paith bana lee
 But soon Modi's strategic stakes such as 'vibrant Gujarat' led to such a makeover as 'vikas Purush' that he was projected as the 'biggest face of development'
 modi ne kareeb saadhe 12 saal gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahane ke baad 2014 main centre kaa rukh kiya
 The last election of Gujarat Legislative Assembly in 2012 was fought under Modi's leadership
 aise main 2017 main gujarat vidhansabha kaa chunaav jo ladaa ja rahaa he, wo 2002 ke baad pehla mauka he, jab rajya main modi ke bina bijepi netritv kii pariksha he
 Modi also knows this thing very well
 isiilie ye chunaav unke liye khud bhi saakh kaa sawaal ban gaya he
 Therefore Modi and his master strategist Amit Shah do not want to leave any stone unturned in Gujarat
 yahi vajah he ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar ke liye modi tabadatod reliyaan karenge
 As far as the main opposition party Congress is concerned, it has been out of power in Gujarat for the last 22 years
 modi ke centre kii satta main hone ke saath congress ne gujarat bijepi ke netaaon ke antarvirodhon, satta virdohi lahar, hardik patel-alpesh thakor-jignesh mewaani kii yuva tikdi ke andolanon se upje janaakrosh ke dam par gujarat kii satta main waapas aane kii jo ummiden paali hai, party jaanati he ki modi-shah kii jodi unhen aasaani se paravaan nahin chadhane degi
 Congress is also playing its bets carefully on Election Chaucer only after assessing all the political gains and losses
 kareeb dhai dashak se gujarat main haashie par khadi congress ke liye ye chunaav ‘karo yaa maro’ kii sthiti vaala he
 The Congress knows that the results of this election were the same as if every election of Gujarat assembly has been coming since 1995, then the existence of Congress in the state will be questioned
 congress gujarat main kaise phoonk-phoonk kar kadam uthaa rahi he, iskaa saboot isi se miltaa he ki wo aisa koi sandesh nahin dena chaahati jisase ki bijepi ko us par ‘hindutv’ kaa janaa-parkhaa ‘chunavi rambaan’ daagne kaa mauka mil jaae
 The Congress, while calling itself the biggest Alambardar of 'secularism', may not say it out of mouth, but this time in Gujarat, it is seen strategically holding the line of 'soft Hindutva'
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne chunavi bigul bajaane ke liye saurashtra main road sho shuru kiya to pehle dwarikadhish ke saamne sheesh navaya
 Then saw mother Chamunda at Chotala
 madhya gujarat ke duusare daure main santaram mandir, bhathiji mandir jaakar maathaa teka
 According to sources, the Congress is also trying to show its senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel away from this election in Gujarat as part of a well thought-out strategy
 sab jaanate hai ki haal main hue rajyasabha chunaav main ahamed patel ne kis tarah amit shah kii tamaam kilabandi ko dhwast karte hue jeet hasil kii thi
 The Congress is, of course, keeping Ahmed Patel away from the Gujarat Assembly elections, but Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, in a press conference on October 27, regarding the two alleged terrorists arrested in Surat, must take the name of Ahmed Patel on the backfoot Tried to go
 roopaani ne aarope lagaaya ki giraftaar kiye gaye do kathith aatankiyon main se ek ankleshwar ke sardaar patel aspataal kaa karmchaaree tha, jisase ahamed patel jude rahe hai
 Rupani also demanded Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to resign Ahmed Patel
 roopaani ke is bounsar kaa jawaab dene ke liye ahamed patel ke saath congress ko bhi saamne aana padaa
 Ahmed Patel said in a tweet that BJP should not do politics on the issue of national security
 saath hi kaha ki aatankwaad se ladate hue bijepi gujarat ke shantipriy logon ko naa baante
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also strongly defended Ahmed Patel, saying that Ahmed Patel resigned in 2014 only from the hospital the BJP is talking about
 iske baad unka is aspataal se koi judaav nahin rahaa
 In such a situation, if someone is caught in any charge, how can the trustee of the hospital of 2014 be held responsible for it
 ye raajnneeti kaa contrast hi he ki bijepi ne 2007 or 2012 main gujarat kaa vidhansabha chunaav jis vikaas kii kashti par savaar hokar jeeta, usee ‘vikaas’ ko lekar soshal media main bijepi par sabase zyada tanj kase ja rahe hai
 To capitalize on this situation, the Congress has also opened its horses
 congress patidaar, obisi or dalit card ke saath soft hindutv kaa daanv bhi bade sadhe andaaj main khel rahi he
 According to political experts, after 2002, the bjp's attempt in Gujarat was to show that the Congress, while following the policy of appeasement, thinks only of minorities, especially Muslims and thinking of the betterment of Hindus is not on its agenda
 
 raajnneetik jaankaar kehete hai ki ye sandesh dekar ek tarah se bahusnkhyakon ko ye dar dikhaaya jaataa rahaa, wo tay kar len ki congress gujarat kii satta main waapas aa gai to kiske hit ke liye kaam karegi
 The Congress too, considering this political multiplication, is not taking any such step on its part, so that the BJP gets a chance to attack it by accusing it of Muslim appeasement
 rahul gandhi ke gujarat jaakar mandiron main maathaa techne ke nihitarth samajhe ja sakate hai
 Rahul and Congress in Gujarat have tried to break the image that BJP has coined for them by following the line of soft Hindutva
 rahul kii sari mashkkat kaa yuva varg main party kii chhavi badalane ke liye kuch phayda hota bhi dikh rahaa he
 60 percent of the total voters of Gujarat are under the age of 40
 congress gujarat ke yuva votaron main patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani kii kitni ahmiyat he, ise bhi bakhubi samajhati he
 So she wants to keep this trio with her in any way to cash out the anger against BJP
 alpesh to congress main hi shaamil ho gaye hai, vahiin jignesh dalit samudaay kii ore se congress samarthan kii khule taur par baat kah chuke hai
 However, the practice of Patidar leader Hardik Patel is proving to be a crook for the Congress as well
 hardik ne do took kaha he ki congress 7 november tak saaf kar de ki wo kaise patidaaron ko aarakshan degi
 If it is not done, then it will be the same as it was with BJP President Amit Shah in Surat
 yahaan ye bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki gujarat main yuva votaron main bada tabaka bhi aise yuvaaon kaa he jinhone beete 22 saal main bijepi ko hi gujarat main raaj karte dekha he
 The development which has always been talked about by Narendra Modi and the BJP has been cut off due to unemployment, privatization of education, illegal sale of liquor despite prohibition, distress of farmers due to the burden of debt, no real value for the crop
 Issues like meeting are being raised by the youth leaders doing caste politics
 or kaaphi had tak in yuva netaaon kii baton kaa unke samarthakon par asar bhi ho rahaa he
 It has to be seen whether the bjp's mantra of development in Gujarat remains effective even in this assembly election, for which Modi himself has to go ahead and say, 'I am Vikas, i am Gujarat
 ’ yaa phir congress yuva tikdi ko apni naav par saath lekar soft hindutv kii patavaar se gujarat kii chunavi dhara kaa rukh 22 saal baad apni ore modane main kaamyaab rahati he
 The political camel sits in Gujarat on December 18, it cannot be said right now, but it is clear that whatever the outcome will be, it will definitely decide the condition and direction of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to some extent
 sansad ke monsoon satr main lagaataar gatirodh bana hua he
 The Congress party will raise the issue of mob lynching in the Lok Sabha on Friday
 congress kaa kahana he ki sarkaar is mudde par soi hui he, unhen jawaab dena chahie
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that we have wanted a long debate on this issue, but the government is not responding
 khadge ne kaha ki ham log apane 6 saansadon ke nilamban kaa mudda nahin uthaanaa chaahate hai, ham bas mob linching ke mudde par bahes chaahate hai
 During the monsoon session of the Parliament, the Congress created an uproar in the Lok Sabha on the issue of mob lynching during the debate
 loksabhaa main spikar sumitra mahajan kii ore kaagaj oochhaalane vaale 6 congress saansadon ko suspend kar diya he
 The speaker has suspended Gaurav Gogoi, k Suresh, Adhir Ranjan, Ranjit Ranjan and Sushmita Dev for 5 days
 mob linching par charchaa kii maang ko lekar ye saansad hangaamaa kar rahe the
 The Congress had introduced the dossier to tell you that earlier this week, the opposition including Congress had debated this issue in Parliament
 congress ne sansad main 40 pannon kaa dogier pesh kiya tha
 The BJP overturned a 40-page dossier given by the Congress in Parliament
 sambit paatra ne press conference kar kaha ki dogier main algaavvaadiyon kaa naam nahin he, congress bas sansad ko thap karnaa chaahati he
 In this, Congress has not made any mention in this dossier on the issue of Ayub Pandit
 sambit paatra ne kaha tha ki hamaari sarkaar kisi bhi film ko bain nahin kar rahi he, balki congress indu sarkaar par bain lagane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The PM has given statements on cow guards several times, yet the Congress wants to make it an issue
