 '2017 main counselling ke dauraan mujhe jo fees bataai gai thi uske anusaar tution fees 8 lakh 55 hazaar or hostel fees 2 lakh rupye thi
 After this, when i came to join the college, the index college management asked me for two lakh rupees in the name of cash money and extra-curricular activity
 chunki main madhyamvargeey parivaar se hum isliye atirikt fees nahin chukaa sakati thi lekin neet pariksha ke baad bamushkil mila piji karne kaa ye avasar haath se naa nikal jaae isliye maine do lakh kaa phir lone liya
 After this, as soon as i arrived to join the college management again demanded two lakh rupees
 iske baad raat bhar ke prayaas ke baad maine apni seat khone ke dar se maine vyavastha bhi kii lekin college ne tution fees 8 lakh 55 hazaar se 9 lakh 90 hazaar kar di or sabhi chaatro se yah fees jamaa karne ko bolaa
 Apparently, it was difficult for everyone to bear the one lakh and 35 thousand fee increase, so all of us went against it to Jabalpur High Court
 iske baad college prabandhan ne mujhe vyaktigat taur par pratadit karnaa shuru kar diya
 Apart from this, on the phone, i was threatened to withdraw this case
 iske baad court ne index college ko nirdhaarit fees lene kaa aadesh diya lekin iske baad phir agle saal 9 lakh 90 hazaar rupye maangane lage
 
 
 i deposited only 8 lakh 55 thousand as per court order

 Uttarakhand is still moaning due to the flood of devastation that came ten days ago
 vahaan tabaahi ke aae sailaab ne sabase zyada vinaash kaa tandav machaaya khud kedaar dham main
 There is nothing left but the temple
 das din baad kedarnath ke mandir kaa kya haal he, iske liye puure 24 ghante tak cameraman sanjay choudhary ke saath kedarnath main ruk kar halaat kaa jayja liya hamaare samvaadadaata ashok singhl ne
 The scene of death spread at the rate of the god of destruction, that even after 10 days, there is a frightening silence
 chaaro dham main se ek bhagwaan kedarnath kaa mandir bhi kedardhaam ke vajood ko bataane ke liye bachaa he
 Otherwise everything was destroyed
 aasmaan se badalon ko faadte hue aisi tabaahi barsi ki baba kedarnath ke is mandir ke sivaa yahaan kuch nahin bachaa
 The torrential currents of the Mandakini and Saraswati rivers kiss the footsteps of Lord Shiva and proceed here
 lekin 16 june ko kedarnath ke chaaron taraf maujuud parvat shrinkhalaaon se khaufnak sailaab kii aahat sunai padi
 For those who were in the temple at that time, it was no less than the flood of flood
 baba kii nagari tabah hone lagi
 Great buildings started collapsing
 parivaar ke saath, apane gaanv- shahar ke logon ke saath jatthon main aae log, jatthon main hi laharon main tairne lage
 Large stones coming with strong waves began to mattify the most sacred land of Devbhoomi
 sadiyon main jo devanagari aabaad hui thi, wo lamhon main barbaad ho gai
 Aaj Tak is telling you the condition of Baba reaching the rate of Kedarnath
 
 
 sailaab kii dhar main bhagwaan to batch gaye hai lekin bhakt nahin
 The temple of God has also survived, but now there is no echo of devotion on his platform
 nandi bhi virajman hai lekin ab nandi kii sud lene vaala koi nahin
 In the city where the glory of Shiva Dhun has never stopped, nothing is left except the silence of death and the possibility of untowardness
 jahaan har har mahadev kii gunj sunai padati thi, vahaan ab baba ke naam kii ghanti nahin baj rahi he
 Nor did Bhole Bhandari's Jalabhishek
 jab sailaab aayaa to ek bada pathar aakar mandir ke peeche lag gaya
 This saved the temple safely, but there was nothing left behind or right-left
 sailaab kaa sitam khatm hua to tabaahi or vinaash ke bich bas mandir hi bachaa rahaa
 The havoc of nature shook the biggest center of devotion
 ab intjaar he ki jald se jald mausam khule or phir se kedarnath ke dar par raunak laute

 bhavi pradhanmantri narendra modi or unki patni ne ek chat beshak saajha na kii ho, lekin unki patni jashoda ben ko apane pati jaisaa hi suraksha kavach jarur mil saktaa he
 a former senior IPS officer said that as per the SPG rules, 62-year-old Jashoda Ben is entitled to 100 per cent of the cover of the High Level Special Protection Group (SPG) and that along with Modi becoming Prime Minister, Jashoda Ben will also be provided security
 
 purv sachiv (suraksha) or madhya pradesh police ke purv mahanideshak subhash chandra treepathi ne pitiai ko bataaya ki espiji adhinium sidhe taur par kahata he ki use pradhanmantri ke parivaar ke sadasyon ko suraksha uplabdh karwaani hogi
 Therefore, despite the factuality of the relationship between Jashodaben and her husband, this rule also applies to them
 treepathi purv pradhanmantri aaike gujral ke kaarykaal ke dauraan suraksha sachiv rah chuke hai
 Jashoda Ben lives with her two brothers in a small village called Ishwarawada in Mehsana district of northern Gujarat
 espiji adhinium varsh 1988 main lagu hua tha or isamen varsh 1991, 1994 or 1999 main sanshodhan hua tha
 The Act provides 'proximate security' to the Prime Minister and his own family members
 purv pradhanmantri or unke apane parivaar ke sadsy bhi unke pad se hatane ke 10 saal baad tak espiji suraksha lene ke adhikari hai
 People in the office said that the person taking the security can also refuse for the security cover, but this is possible only when there is no danger
 yadi suraksha lene vaale vyakti ko jaraa sa bhi khatra hota he, to uske liye suraksha lenaa anivaary ho jaataa he
 Modi, while filing his nomination from Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, admitted for the first time that Jashoda Ben was his wife

 jaaniye koun-koun hai vaartakalmerica kii ore se baatcheet kar rahe hai afgaan mul ke america rajanyik jalami khalilzad to taliban kii ore se 14 sadasyeey team is vaarta main shaamil he
 The leader of Taliban negotiators is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar
 baradar osama bin laden or mullah umr kaa kareebi rahaa he or taliban kaa sansthaapak or number do sthaan par mana jaataa he
 The Taliban team also includes Anas Haqqani, the brother of the leader of the Haqqani faction
 vaartakaron kii team main cuba kii kukhyat gvantanamo be jail main band rahe 5 purv taliban ladaake bhi shaamil hai
 Those who were freed by the Taliban from the US in 2014 in exchange for the release of the American sergeant
 taliban ke purv ladaakon ko vaarta kii teble par laakar america shanti kaa rasta dhundne or 18 saal se jari afgaan vivaad se jaldi se jaldi peechha chhudaane kii koshish main he
 Russia and China are making separate efforts to make this dialogue a success
 america is vaarta ko safal banane ke liye pakistan se bhi kaaphi ummiden lagaae hue he kyonki wo jaanata he ki taliban ko banane, paalane or bachaane main pakistan kii sidhi bhoomika he
 Who is the main Taliban interlocutor Mullah Baradar? Taliban chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Gani Baradar is one of the founders of the Taliban and is considered to have a great influence on the people of the organization
 vah america main 9 / 11 ke aatanki hamale ke pehle osama bin laden kaa nikat sahyogi tha
 In 1994, he worked with Mullah Omar to establish the Taliban
 baradar ko taliban ke mukhiya mullah umr ke baad duusare number par mana jaataa tha
 He held several positions in Afghanistan until the fall of the Taliban government in 2001
 mullah abdul gani baradar ko iesai or siie ke ek sikret oparation ke tahat 2010 main pakistan ke karachi shahar se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He remained in jail till 2018
 lekin vaarta ke liye america ne use reeha karavaaya
 He has since run a Taliban diplomatic office in Qatar
 kya hai donon pakshon kii maangen?is vaarta main taliban kii mukhya maang he ki afghanistan se videshi suraksha bal baahar chale jaaen
 In return for this demand from the Taliban, America wants an assurance that it will not allow the land of Afghanistan to be used as a base of terrorists
 khaskar alqaida or iesas jaise sanghathanon ko vahaan badhaava nahin degaa
 Apart from this, prisoners will be exchanged from both sides and travel ban imposed on some Taliban leaders can also be removed
 haalanki, isamen pech afgaan sarkaar or pakistan ke bich jari matbhed ko lekar bhi he
 In fact, Afghanistan has been accusing Pakistan of providing safe haven to Taliban and Haqqani network terrorists
 america ke liye bhi sthiti dodhari talwaar par chalane jaistybhi afghanistan main nato deshon ke 20 hajaar se adhik sainik tainaat hai
 Most of which are American soldiers
 jo aatankwaad rodhi oparation ke alaava afgaan sainikon kii training, takneekee sahaayta or samrik taiyaariyon main jute hai
 On the other hand, except for the capital city of Kabul, a large part of Afghanistan today has considerable control of Taliban factions
 america ke liye do badi chunautiyaan saamne hai
 On the one hand, where the American troops are to be withdrawn, the election of Afghan President to be held in September is also to be done peacefully
 videshi sainikon ke hatane ke baad taliban ke vibhinn gut phir gorilla yuddh main jute na jaaen iskaa khatra alag se he
 What the United States achieved After the 9 / 11 attacks in 2001 from the Afghan War, the United States fought in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaeda
 tab se america vahaan ek kharab dollar kharch kar chukaa he
 The US no longer wants further damage to the lives of its soldiers in the Afghan war
 pichley hafte hi ek hamale main do america sainikon kii maut ho gai
 So far this year, the US has lost 14 soldiers in the Afghan war
 ab trump jald se jald america sainikon ko vahaan se waapas bulaanaa chaahate hai
 But experts believe that any agreement between the US and the Taliban will not only bring peace in Afghanistan, but the Taliban will also have to negotiate with the us-backed Afghan government and form an agreement
 taliban ko lekar kya he daravaarta se thodi ummiden hai to taliban ke bhavishya ko lekar sanshay zyada hai
 The Taliban has repeatedly given the message that it can attack anywhere, it has control over a large part of Afghanistan's land and without it there can be no political solution
 america ke jane ke baad agar taliban satta main hissedaar banataa he to taliban ke ugr islamic agenda ke lagu hone se kshetra main phir kattarwad ko badhaava milegaa
 Because after coming to power, there will be no one to stop the Taliban
 or 2001 se pehle taliban apane krur or kattar shashan kii jhalak afghanistan main dikhaa chukaa he
 Today, Afghanistan has started on the path of modernity due to modern projects of India
 taliban or pakistan kaa kattarpanth phir afgaan logon kii tarakkee ke raste main baadha na ban jaaen
 India's main concerns about the Taliban and Pakistan Since the Afghan war broke out in 2001, India has initiated several projects for development and revival there
 bharat ne afghanistan ke vikaas ke liye 4 billian dollar se adhik kaa nivesh kiya he
 Reconstruction of Afghan Parliament, construction of Salma Dam, construction of Zaranj Delaram Road, cooperation in construction of Garland Highway, construction of road from Bamiyan to bandar-aabbas, construction of Kabul Cricket Stadium and 4 mig-25 attack helicopters
 afgaan raksha balon ko bharat training bhi de rahaa he
 The Taliban do not take Afghanistan on the path of fundamentalism
 India is concerned about the strategic situation with Pakistan and the security of its development projects and investment in Afghanistan after the departure of foreign troops
 bharat, taliban ko manyata nahin detaa he or kahata rahaa he ki taliban apane kattar agenda se baahar nahin nikal saktaa
 In such a situation, the pakistan-taliban jugalbandi should not use the soil of Afghanistan for anti-india activities
 china ko lekar bhi bharat satarkiske alaava america ke hatane ke baad pakistan or china kaa agar prabhaav afghanistan main badhata he to ye bharat kii chintaa badhaane vaali sthiti hogi
 Pakistan will use its influence on the Taliban to try to connect Afghanistan with China's One Belt One Road project, which could be dangerous for India's economic and strategic interests

 In an event, Shivpal said, "durga had taken action there due to conspiracy of some parties
 ' unhone durga ke nilamban ko sahi faisla qaraar dete hue kaha ki akhilesh soch samaj kar faisla lete hai
 He said, 'durga Shakti Nagpal, SDM of Gautam Buddha Nagar, got caught in a conspiracy by opposition parties to demolish the mosque wall and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has taken a mature step by suspending them
 'yadav ne ‘chote lohia’ ke naam se mashhoor janeshwar mishra kii 81veen jainti par yojit kaarykram se alag ek baatcheet main kaha, ‘kai vipakshi dal sampradayik danga bhadakaane kii sajeesh kar rahe the
 As part of the conspiracy, he gave a complaint letter to Nagpal for raising the wall of the mosque
 unki sajeesh main aakar nagpal ne diwaar girava di
 'he said,' The wall of the mosque could have caused a riot anytime anywhere
 diwaar nahin girani chaiye thi
 That matter could be settled by negotiation
 jab kisi ko etraj nahin tha to diwaar kyon giraayi gayi
 On the question whether the Chief Minister took action to suspend Durga Shakti due to inexperience, Yadav clarified that Akhilesh had been an MP
 unamem anubhav kii kami nahin he
 He made a mature decision
 pradesh main agar koi adhikari is tarah kii karrwai karegaa to uske khilaaf kadam uthaaye jaaenge
 Yadav did not comment on the demand of his senior cabinet colleague Azam Khan to suspend the District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar

 ’ report main kaha gaya he ki is masjid ke nirmaan ke liye sapa ke ghoshit loksabhaa pratyaashee narendra bhaati ne teen maheene pehle 51 hajaar rupee diye the tathaa uskaa udghaatan kiya tha
 It is worth mentioning that Durga Shakti Nagpal, a sub-inspector of Gautam Budh Nagar, who came to the well-known as a campaign against the mining mafia, was suspended on 27 July last on charges of spreading communal tension by demolishing the wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village of Rabupura area

 Sushil Modi accused the JDU of remaining silent on the issue because of votebank politics
 iske jawaab main jediu kaa kahana he ki ve har chote mudde kaa shrey nahin lete hai
 Sushil Modi tweeted, 'JDU party calling Ishrat Jahan a daughter may also declare Yasin Bhatkal as son-in-law of Bihar (as she is married in Samastipur)'
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki susheel modi kii ore se siyaasi hamalon kii shuruyaat guuruuvaar ko hi ho gai thi
 He tweeted, 'why is the Bihar police not taking the credit for Yasin Bhatkal's arrest for taking the credit for arresting petty criminals? Is it because of vote bank politics? ”when Sushil Modi attacked, the answer came from JDU too
 jediu pravaktaa ajay alok ne susheel modi par ghatiya raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki bijepi dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Ajay Alok said, 'sushil Modi has become politically bankrupt
 modi sasti raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The reason for not patting our own back is not votebank politics
 balki bijepi hi raajnneeti or dharm ko milaane kii koshish kar rahi he

 Anjali's room is decorated with flowers and the mobile is filled with birthday messages
 par is khushnuma din ke mahaj 72 ghante baad hi bhopal ke shahpura sthit farchun galori main is kamare kii tasviir badal gai
 Anjali said goodbye to her life before the flowers kept in the vase could dry completely
 vaayu sena kii purv flying adhikari, jo aasmaan naapane ke sapane dekha karti thi, anjali ne pankhe se latak kar jaan de di
 The feuds that followed along the shadows did not leave her in the last moments, leaving behind her unhappy relationship with group Captain Amit Gupta and a life of unhappiness
 shahpura police ne nagpur main padasth 49 varshiya group captain amit ko dhara 306 ke tahat anjali ko khudakushi ke liye uksaane ke aarope main giraftaar kiya he
 It is said that Anjali was in a live-in relationship with Amit for the past about eight years, i
e
 both were living without marriage
 anjali ne bhopal sthit gupta ke ghar main hi aatmahatya kar lee
 a four-member team of the Air Force arrived in Bhopal under the leadership of Wing Commander RS nakel and Sergeant Officer Balia, who interrogated Captain Gupta at the Shahpura police station after which he was formally arrested by the police
 darasal amit ke shuruaati bayaan virodhabhasi rahe hai
 According to him, he was out of Bhopal during the incident but it is learned that he had reached Bhopal before Anjali committed suicide
 anjali kii short postmortem report bhi bataati he ki is ghatana ko 18 ghante tak dabaa kar rakhaa gaya
 Anjali was the first woman officer of the Indian Air Force to be court martialed
 2001 main bangaloru main airforce stesan par aircraft system ke testing ystablishment kii prabharee rah chuki anjali ne farvari 2005 main teen varisht adhikariyon par shaareerik pratadna, sheelbhang kaa prayaas jaise gambhir aarope lagaae the, jiske baad vaayu sena ne anjali ke khilaaf anushaasanheenata or aarthik gadabadiyon ke aarope main court marshall kii karrwai kii or 8 disambar, 2005 ko unhen paanch binduon par doshi qaraar dete hue unhen barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Tales of his dismissal became the headlines of Pakistan
 vahaan kii website pakistan think tanks main bhartiya sena main shaareerik pratadna jaise kisse chatkhaare lekar chalaae gaye
 As a result, Anjali also received sympathy from a section of the Air Force
 vivaadon or maansik tanaav se guzar rahi anjali apane varisht adhikari shaadishuda captain gupta ke najadik aa gai
 This led to his wife being separated from him and he and Anjali Liv in relationship
 anjali ke parijanon kaa aarope he ki uskaa kariyar or ab uskaa jivan khatmakarne vaale gupta hi hai, unke hi kaaran anjali vah maamla police tak lekar gai
 Anjali's sister Alka Garg has told the police that Gupta had promised Anjali that she would marry him after divorcing his wife, but did not marry after eight years
 is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe siespi rajesh bhadauria bataate hai ki anjali kii maut ek naakaam liv in rilaship kaa maamla he
 Anjali these days was working in a private company in Bangalore
 jab ve bhopal pahunchin to amit apane parivaar ke kisi kaarykram main shariq hone dilli chale gaye, unhone police ko bataaya ki jab ve laute to dekha ki anjali apane kamare main thi or daravaaje band the isliye ve arera colony sthit apni sasuraal chale gaye
 And when he returned home on Sunday morning, he saw that Anjali had died by hanging from the fan
 anjali ke kamare main police ko petrol se bhare do kavn bhi mili hai
 It seems that perhaps she wanted to die by setting fire but later she got hanged
 baharhaal vaayu sena ne captain gupta ko vayusena adhinium ke tahat seva se nilambit kar diya he
 Wing Commander RS nakel said that Gupta will remain suspended until the judicial process and investigation in the matter is completed

 In Madhya Pradesh, onion is now shedding the tears of farmers
 banpar paidaavaar se mandiyon main kisaan ko uchit keemat nahin mil rahi he, upar se sarkaar ne pyaaj kharidni band kii to kisaanon kii ankhon se aansu nikalne lage
 In such a situation, the farmers of Madhya Pradesh can also cry onion tears to the Shivraj government in the elections to be held on November 28
 fasal barbaad ho yaa banpar paidaavaar, kisaan behaalchhindwara ke aas-paas jilon se saikadonkisanhjaron quintal pyaaj or lahasun kii khep mandi main lekar aa rahe hai
 This time there is a bumper crop of onion and garlic but the farmer is still crying
 jab mausam kii maar fasal kharaab kar detii he to tab bhi nuksaan uthaata he
 Now there is more yield, so this time the price is not available in the market
 sarkaar pyaaj kharid nahin rahi he, isliye chhindwara ke kisaan bichauliye or thekedaaron ke sahare hai
 Kisan Ramkumar is one such farmer who has brought 2000 kg of onion to the market, Kisanram Kumar said in conversation with Aaj Tak, the price of onion has come down to 608 rupees per kg, so the cost of harvest is hard and more If you get the cost of living, nothing is left in the name of profit
 ram kumaar jaise mandi main aise kai log hai, jinka kahana he ki sarkaar kii berukhi or girti keemat se kisaan kisaani hi chhod denge
 Ram Kumar says that if this situation happens then how will we do farming
 sarkaar kii yojanaon se badha utpaadanhaalanki chhindwara shahar kii mandi ke adhyaksh vijay vagadi kaa kahana he ki is saal utpaadan zyada hone ke chalate keemat kam ho gai he
 The chairman of the mandi says that due to the government's plans, the farmer is getting 24 hours of electricity, hence the bumper production is going on and if the production is high then the price will fall
 rajya main congress kii sarkaar banavaa sakate hai kisansusheel kumaar kaa kahana he kishiwaraj singh chauhanan madhya pradesh main acha kaam kiya lekin kisaanon ke bich kai muddon ko lekar aisi naaraazgi he
 Due to this, farmers can also vote for change this time
 unka kahana he ki congress ne kisaanon kaa karj maafee ke saath-saath kai ghoshnaaen kii hai
 In such a situation, farmers can make changes in the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh this time
 lekin vah yah bhi chetavanee dete hai ki agar congress ne kisaanon se kiya vaada puraa nahin kiya to 4 maheene baad loksabhaa chunaav main kisaan congress ko buree tarah haraayenge
 The government's bonus on maize crop is not only onion, but this time there is a bumper yield of maize in Chhindwara
 chhindwara ko corn city yani makka kaa shahar bhi kaha jaataa he
 Thousands of sacks are spread in the market of Chhindwara, the yield is so that there is no place to keep it in the market
 sarkaar bhi makka nahin kharid rahi he, isliye kisaan sirf duusare rajyon se aane vaale thekedaaron or sethon ke sahare baithe hai
 However, farmers are benefiting from the additional bonus of 500 rupees per quintal or Bhavantar scheme by the Shivraj government
 susheel kumaar 200 rupee prati quintal ke hisaab se makka lekar mandi main 2 din se bikne kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Saying that the price of Rs 100 per quintal, the farmers will not get the cost
 lekin sarkaar dwaara 500 rupee prati quintal kaa bhavantar milane se ghaataa hone se bachaa ja rahaa he
 Sushil says that this is the problem with the farmer every time
 jab sarkaar nahin kharid rahi to thekedaaron ko one paune daam main anaaj bechnaa padataa he
 But Shivaraj government survived the loss due to Bhavantara

 aswin ne kaha ki kohli jab lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ran banaate hai, to unki ballebaaji dekhte hi banati he
 When Ross Taylor dropped the catch of Kohli in the Mohali ODI, he had made his half-century shortly after
 isse ye pataa chalata he ki wo kitni teji se lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ran banaate hai

 Ashwin said that Kohli is as low as he is praised and there are no words to compliment Kohli
 agar unhen koi naam dena hi he to unhen 'model' kaha ja saktaa he
 Because they are big role models of everyone
 kohli kii akramakata main ai kami: ashvinamtaur par viraat kohli ko log gusse vaala or behad akramak vyakti kehete hai
 But it is not like they belong to the second generation
 pichley kuch samay se unhone apane gusse or akramakata par control kiya he
 When Kohli hit his 26th century, he celebrated it comfortably and when he reached 150, he did not celebrate

 Hunger is the biggest problem of this state and that is why the UPA central government has implemented the food bill
 unhone bataaya ki khaadya suraksha bill ke paas hone ke samay maa (sonia gandhi) kii tabiyat kharaab thi, lekin uske baavjood vah sadan main khadi raheen, jabaki maine unhen manaa kiya
 Actually, she wanted to vote on the bill

" lekin meri najar main adivaasiyon kii izzat sabase badi baat he or yah raajnneeti kii baat nahin he
 All the promises of the government regarding development in this state have proved to be hollow

 Congress will be the government and it will respect the tribals, women, youth, poor and Dalits, who will not do it, then we will see it
 unhone bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya ki vah aam aadmi, adivaasiyon, garibon or dalit ko sansad, vidhansabhaon or panchayaton main nahin dekhnaa chaahati
 This causes loss of the country
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon main adivaasiyon kii sankhya bahut kam he or yah is desh main bahut badi kami he
 We want to change this in the coming time, till the voice of the tribals reach the Lok Sabha and the assemblies, your picture will not change

 Here only corruption has taken place, rape has taken place and hunger is dominated here
 unhone unicef kii ek report kaa hawala dete hue kaha, madhyapradesh main bhukh kii sthiti africa jaisi he
 When someone is hungry, then the matter of development does not even begin
 bhaajapa sarkaar ke vikaas kaa paimaana sadaken hai, ek taraf sadak bana do or duusari ore adivasee ko khadaa kar vahaan se chamakati hui gaadiyaan nikaalo
 Is this their development? congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki vah nae prakaar kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai, jisamen netaa, aam aadmi ke paas jaae, uske saath khaanaa khaae
 Aam Aadmi should appear in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha and fulfill the dream of development of the country and state

 or agar sadakon kii baat karen to bataa den ki upie ne endie se teen guna sadaken banavaai hai
 Attacking the state government, Rahul said, Madhya Pradesh is a university of corruption

 unki film da adventures of tintinah da sikret of da unicorn 11 november ko bharat main relies hone ja rahi he
 Excerpts from India Today's Associate Copy Editor Narendra Saini's conversation with Spielberg in Paris (france) on different occasions: When did you think a film should be made on Tintin? lekin mujhe ehsaas hua ki film ko banane ke liye us samay sahi technology maujuud nahin thi
 i postponed making films and started making other films
 lekin 21veen sadi ke shuru main mujhe tintin ko parade par utaarne kii technology mil gai or maine phir se tintin ke adhikaar hasil kiye
 Created the script and i started looking for an animation company that could do it like never before
 main apane dost jouj luka
 i could go to Ireland to work with J's company because i made many films in Ireland
 lekin kuch kaarnon se mujhe laga ki yah mauka peter jackson kii company veta ko diya janaa chahie
 i asked Veta to do a test on Snowy
 main jaananaa chahta tha ki digital dog kaisaa dikhataa he
 He did it
 unhen teen maheene kaa samay laga or nattejey saamne the
 i reached my company to see the result and as soon as i turned on the projector, there was Snowy in front
 snoi behtareen tha
 Captain Haddock also appeared on the screen immediately
 capten haddock ke kapadon main koi or nahin balki peter jackson hi the
 He said, 'steven, i wanted this opportunity, when you are testing Snowy, i can also play Captain Haddock
 ' yahi screen test bhi tha, beshak gambhir rup se nahin, lekin peter ne puraa screen test kiya
 That way i could see how Snowy would treat humans and do good work
 kya aapako heraje se milane kaa mauka mila tha?main sirf phone par hi unase baat kar sakaa tha
 i told him that i am a tremendous fan of his art and stories
 badale main unhone bhi kaha tha ki ve meri filmon khaskar indiana jonesh reders of da lost ork ke jabardast prashansak hai
 They kept talking about the Raiders released on the phone some time ago
 maine unase 1983 main baat kii thi or reders 1981 main relies hui thi
 i told him that i had called him so that i could meet him
 main unki book ko film main tabdeel karnaa chahta tha
 You know, Herje had said that i am the only director who will be able to complete justice with his book
 unhone yah shabd phone par kahe the
 You believe, i am not boasting about my boast
 unhone mujhse kaha tha ki kya main agle hafte unase milane aa saktaa hum? lekin main aisa nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki main us samay landan main indiana jones kii shooting kar rahaa tha
 i set an appointment with him three weeks later
 ham bahut khush the or hamane kaha ki ab ham aamane-saamne baithkar baat kar sakenge
 We hung up
 or do hafte baad unki maut ho gai
 The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is releasing in India 6 weeks before the US, special reason? We are looking to introduce Tintin as an original movie in the US because people in America do not know Tintin too much
 
 ham ummid kar rahe hai ki ve tintin ko bhi usee tarah janenge jis tarah indiana jones, iti, star vars yaa avatar jaisi filmon ko janaa tha
 These films had nothing to do with books, but Tintin has sold 220 million copies worldwide
 isiilie film ko pehle europe or asia main relies kiya ja rahaa he
 Have you fully judged animation and live action? Yes
 isliye kyonki sabhi paatro main ekadam se jaan aa gai he
 They contain all the expressions that humans have because all the roles humans have played
 lekin anemator ne unke chehron, ankhon or vyaktitv main aisi jaan foonki he ki ham kah sakate he ki hamane kar dikhaaya
 i am not praising myself
 iskaa sara shrey main veta or team ke anya sadasyon ko detaa hum, saath hi un anemetars ko jinhone is khwab ko sach kar dikhaaya
 How would you explain the combination of technology and story in the current scenario? Technology has made things easier but it is not paramount
 agar aapke paas ek mahaan vichaar yaa majboot kahani nahin he to aap sirf technology ko aadhaar banaakar ek badi yaa kaamyaab film banane ke bare main soch bhi nahin sakate hai
 Which is your favorite character in The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn? Captain Haddock
 vah bahut jindadil he, uski baaten kuch hatakar hai or bahut hi mazaakia he
 His ideas do not balance with the rest of the people, and Herje has created a variety of character features for Captain Haddock
 professor calculas ke kirdaar ko hataanaa mushkil faisla rahaa tha?nahin
 We did not remove that, it was not in the book
 vah red rackehams teragers main aata he agar ham sequel banaate hai to ham jarur hi professor calculas ko usamen shaamil karenge
 This part will be directed by Peter Jackson
 is baat kii puri guarantee he
 You and Peter Jackson are planning two more Tintin sequels? This will only be known over time
 agar yah film us tarah kii kamyaabi hasil kar leti he jaisi ham sochate hai or tintin kii romaanch bhari or yatraaon kii maang aati he, to main or peter jarur ise puraa karenge
 We are completely obsessed and interested in making more films of Tintin
 beshak, ham jarur ise karnaa chahenge?reliance antertenment ke saath milakar aap filmein bana rahe hai
 Will anyone else collaborate with India? Can't say anything right now
 lekin reliance big media antertenment mere dreamworks kii filmon main finance kar rahe hai or hamaare liye har sambhav film banane kii koshishon main lage hai
 Our next film is War Horse
 waar horse main bhi kya technology kaa jabardast tadakaa lagaaya gaya he?nahin, waar horse main koi technology nahin he
 It has only artists and horses
 yah ek old skool film he
 We have shot real horses, real locales and film in opposite seasons

 khaas lamhaa:jab daagi saansadon se sambandhit adhyadesh ko bakawaas bataygar 2013 kaa saal vipakshi kheme ke liye ghatana pradhan rahaa, bijepi ne congress kii tarah vyakti ko zyada ahmiyat dete hue narendra modi ko pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar banaaya or ve party se bade ho gaye, to duusari ore congress ne bhi rahul ko sheersh par laane kii kavayad shuru kar di
 The 128-year-old party made 43-year-old Rahul the vice-president of the party at the Jaipur Chintan Camp held in January 2013
 rahul ne apane bhaashan main party ke liye bhavishya kii ruparekha tay karne kii jagah parivaar kii viraasat par hi jor diya
 On the eve of the election year for a party which has been in power for almost 10 years and which is being held responsible for most of the current problems of the country, nothing could be more worrying
 rahul ne jaipur main kaha, ''ab shashan, prashasan or raajnneeti main faisle lene kii kendrikrut or gaiyr-jimmedaarana vyavastha par sawaal uthaane kaa samay aa gaya he
 The answer is not that people say, the system needs to run better
 iskaa jawaab vyavastha ko behatar tareeke se chalaane main nahin he
 The answer is that the system needs to change completely
 ”ve darasal kya kahana chaahate the, iskaa arth vahaan maujuud congress ke logon kii samaj main bhi nahin aayaa
 When Rahul told that his mother came to his room before he was given the post and started crying, ganga-yamuna started flowing from the eyes of the spies present there and they were seen wiping their tears with handkerchiefs
 out-of-form chal rahe kisi ballebaaj kii tarah rahul ne apni viraasat or party se baahar logon kii ummiido ke saath apane nazariye ko jodgaye kii naakaam koshish kii
 Whatever Rahul tried to say from his speeches last year, his message became even more blurred, because his words showed abstractness rather than clarity
 unhone april main kancederation of indian industry (siiai) ke sammelan main udyogpatiyon se kaha tha ki ''bharat madhumakhi kaa chhatta he or yahaan kii jatiltaaon ko dekhte hue vyapaariyon ko pashchim kii tulana main pratispardhaa kaa zyada laabh milegaa
 He was dubbed # Pappu, making fun of his speech on social media
 modi ne rajasthan kii ek jansabha main kaha, ''rahul gandhi kehete hai ki bharat madhumakhi kaa chhatta he, lekin hamaare liye bharat hamaari maa he
 "and when the results of the assembly elections came, the public rejected Rahul's complicated and obscure things instead of simplicity
" isi tarah rahul ne aktubar main dilli main anusuchit jatiyon ke liye yojit rashtriya jaagrukta shivi main kaha tha ki dalit samudaay ko safalataa paane or bharat main daman ke saamaajik dhaanche se baahar nikalne ke liye jupiter kii ''escape velocity” kii darkaar he
 Perhaps they are not aware that the term escape velocity is commonly used to refer to social uplift
 lekin jis sandarbh main unhone iskaa istemaal kiya, vah logon kii samaj main aa hi nahin sakaa
 Rahul set another example of this when he sidelined Ajay Maken, the head of the Department of Communication, at the party's function at the Press Club of India, declaring that the UPA government should protect the tainted mps from disqualification in elections
 The proposed ordinance of "is utter nonsense and should be torn and thrown away
" yah meri nijee raay he
 "but his impunity did not affect the voters
 ab vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne ho saktaa he unhen kuch kar dikhaane ke liye jhanser diya ho
 At the FICCI meeting on December 21, he said, "I want to start with acknowledging that my last quarter results have not been very good
 main jaanata hum ki jab aap buree khabaron ke saath baithak main jate hai to kaisaa mahasoos hota he
 The year ends with Rahul's confession
 samay kam he, aise main unhen khud ke liye escape velocity yani dushchakr se baahar aane vaali raftaar kii sakht jarurat hogi

 Indian bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who performed brilliantly in the third ODI against Sri Lanka, has worked to enhance his career by learning from the bowler of the opposition team
 apane kariyar kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karne vaale tej gendbaaj bumraah ne pallecol vanade main jeet ke baad kaha ki vah har naye match main kuch nayaa seekhney kii dhun se maidan par utarate hai
 Bumrah, who took 5 wickets for 27 runs in the third ODI against Sri Lanka, said he learned a lot from Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga while playing for Mumbai Indians
 bharat kii 6 wicket se jitamen ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale bumraah ne kaha ki vah pehali baar srilanka ke daure par aae hai or isse pehle yahaan kabhi nahin khele isliye alag paristhitiyon main khelnaa hameshaa badi chunauti hoti he

 bumraah ne kaha ki jab vah 2013 main 19 saal ke the tab vah mumbai indian ke saath hai
 He was quite young then, having not even played first-class cricket, so talking to Malinga and learning from him was very useful for Bumrah

 The special thing was that he won the title of becoming the oldest President of America
 ek research study ke mutabik ek baar phir aisa sanyog ban rahaa he ki koi aisa netaa jisaki umr 70 saal se adhik he, vah america kaa raashtrapati ban saktaa he
 According to research, people now live longer than before
 logon ke swasth hone ke ausat maamle bhi bade hai isliye raashtrapati kaa adhik umr kaa hona unki fitness ke liye koi chunauti nahin he
 Researchers have found that age is not a relevant factor in deciding the presidential candidacy for the highest position in the country, because age is simply a 'mere number'
 adhyayan ke lekhak or illinois vishvavidhyalay ke es joy olshanoski ne kaha ki yah adhyayan pehali baar vigyaan aadhaarit gananaa kii baat karata he ki ummidavaar kii umr par bilkul bhi vichaar nahin kiya jayega
 According to the researchers, the four leading candidates of both the Democratic and Republican parties who are contesting the US presidential election in 2020 are 70 or above
 inamen america saansad joy biden kii umr 76, barney sanders kii 77 or elizoth warren kii umr 70 saal he
 All three future candidates belong to the Democratic Party
 republican ummidavaar or vartmaan raashtrapati donald trump kii umr 73 varsh he
 With this, altogether, out of 27 candidates in the presidential election, the age of 7 in January 2021 will be 70 years or more
 janvari 2021 main hi america kaa aglaa raashtrapati kaarybhaar sanbhaalenge
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that the oldest person should take the oath of office on that day
 isse pehle june 2019 main kiye gaye survey main 10 main se chaar vyaktiyon kaa kahana tha ki kisi ke liye bhi raashtrapati ke pad ke liye 70 varsh kii umr adhik he
 But according to the study, old age will not be accepted as the only disqualification to become President
 (IANS input ke saath) The issue of farmers and traders always remains in every election of the country, every political party constantly talks about improving the conditions of these two classes
 desh kii 2 sabase badi partiyon bijepi or congress kii koshish in virgon se badi sankhya main vot hasil karne kii hoti he
 The Modi government has promised to double the income of farmers by 2022, while the Congress has talked about preparing a separate budget for the farmers
 congress kaarobaariyon ko lubhaane ke liye ek ank (single disit) jiesti laane ke prastaav par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 Along with the election manifesto and the headlines, the farmer and businessman are on top in another matter in the elections for the 17th Lok Sabha
 2019 ke aam chunaav main kismat aajamaa rahe ummidavaaron main sabase badi sankhya inhen 2 virgon kisaan or bijnesaman kii he
 This means that the maximum candidates are farmers and businessmen this time

 According to the affidavits filed by the candidates of this Lok Sabha election, 24 percent of the candidates declared their profession related to agriculture

 Historically speaking, earlier the occupation of more than half the candidates used to be related to farming, but now it has come down to a quarter
 yah ek bada badlaav he
 Doctor Giles Vernier says that people are now getting involved in business which is indicative of major changes at social, economic and political levels
 pehle ke daur main chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaaron ko 3 chijen chahie hoti thi, pehla agadi jati kaa darja, jameen or congress kaa tikat
 But now you get your caste number, money (mostly business people arrange money) and tickets from big party
 jameen kii mahatta abhi bhi he, lekin pehle se thodi kam ho gai he
 According to Dr
 Giles Vernier, as more and more businessmen are contesting elections, elections are also becoming more expensive
 aise main raajnneeti main koi or pravesh karnaa chahta he to uske liye raah pehle se or mushkil ho gai he
 Says Vernier, "it is easier for businessmen to bear the expense of entering politics than others
" krishi se alag koi bhi aarthik gatividhi ho amuman zyada munafa detii he, aise main hairaani kii baat nahin ki raajnneeti main kaarobaariyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 Many things make it easier for them to invest in politics such as status, political contacts, access to contracts and resources, protection from government, etc
 raajnneeti main aane ke myne aksar or nijee hit saadhane se bhi jod kar dekhe jate hai

 The central leadership of the BJP is trying to find a solution to the crisis in Karnataka, but the formula of reconciliation between the Chief Minister and the anti-party camp may prove to be a big setback for CM Yeddyurappa
 nahin jaaegi yediurppa kii kursikarnataka bijepi ke bheetar mache ghamaasan main mukhyamantri yediurppa kii kursi nahin jaaegi, ye baat to tay ho chuki he, lekin mumkin he ki unki kursi kii takat pehle jaisi na rahe
 The high command is engaged in reconciliation between the Reddy brothers of Yeddyurappa and his rival camp
 samjhaute kaa jo formula pesh kiya he, wo ek tarah se mukhyamantri yediurppa ke par katarne jaisaa he
 According to the focus on the complaints of the opponents, Yeddyurappa's very special and Rural Development Minister Shobha Karandlaje can be shown the way out of the cabinet
 reddy bandhuon kii shikaayat rahi he ki shobhaa unke mantralay ke kaamon main bhi dakhlandaji karti he
 Karunakara Reddy will be given the responsibility of the Home Ministry, more powerful than the Ministry of Revenue

 The toll on iron ores will be reduced
 haal hi main yediurppa ne ise badhaakar prati trek 1000 rupee karne kaa prastaav kiya tha
 Clearly, if Yeddyurappa and the Reddy brothers agreed on this formula, Yeddyurappa's position as chief minister could suffer a major setback

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) hit back at the BJP after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Delhi
 AAP sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne shanivaar ko press conference karke modi par na sirf 'counter-atake' kiya, balki manch se kiye gaye unke daavon kii hawa bhi nikaali
 He told Amit Shah, who is claiming inflation to be the price of vegetables, to show an ordinance regulating unauthorized colonies, and even took a pinch of 'bajpai bulb' which reduced electricity bills
 gauratlab he ki narendra modi ne ramlila maidan main apni raily menkejariwal ko naam liye bagaiyr na sirf jhootha or arajak bataaya, balki jangalon main naksaliyon ke saath jaakar kaam karne kii naseehat bhi de daali
 Hours later, Kejriwal appeared in front of the media and said that the BJP had no issue left and now it has come down to the politics of negativity
 unhone kaha, 'modi ji ne mujhe jhootha, arajak or dharna karne vaala bolaa
 We never made personal remarks, always did politics of issues
 main jo bhi hum, isse fark nahin padataa
 i am not corrupt at least
 maine bijli ke bill aadhe kiye the
 He said that all the BJP leaders did not utter a single word against their speeches against the 49-day government
 yani unhone paroksh rup se mana ki hamaara kaam acha tha
 The BJP has no agenda, so it is embarking on a personal attack; Arvind Kejriwal # delhiwithkejriwalpic
 twitter
 com / 8k0q1f1mtg — Aam Aadmi Party (@aamaadmiparty) January 10, 2015 In response to a question, he said, 'we do not comment on anyone's personality
 dilli kii janata jaanati he ki kejariwal kya he
 He (modi) said that Kejriwal is anarchic, did it reduce the electricity bills? Problems solved? Whoever i am, i had reduced the electricity bills by half
 'yogendra yadav, ashutosh, manish sisodiya or ashish khetaan jaise party netaaon kii maujuudagi main kejariwal ne andolan ke samay ko yaad karte hue kaha, 'ye vahi ramlila maidan he jahaan par anna hajaare ne dharna kiya tha
 Where after independence there was probably the biggest dharna till date
 aaj usee dharne kaa usee ramlila maidan se majaak udaaya gaya
 'significantly, in 2011, Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal's movement was also supported by Narendra Modi
 us vakt vah gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 But at Saturday's rally, he called Kejriwal a 'dharna master'
 'kahaan kam hui mahangaai, subjiyan nahin kharidte amit shah'kejariwal ne narendra modi or amit shah ke daavon ko ek-ek karke khaarij kiya
 On the issue of inflation, he said, 'today Amit Shah said that inflation has come down
 hamaari sarkaar ke dauraan matar 15 rupee kilo milti thi
 Amit Shah does not have to go to get vegetables
 main jaataa hum, meri patni, maa jaati hai
 Now we get 40 peas

 Last year, carrots were Rs 10 a kg, now Rs 50 a kg
 logon ke ghar subjiyan nahin hai or aap majaak uda rahe hai
 "haryana government has reduced the age of retirement" Kejriwal said that the government has not passed any bill to regularize unauthorized colonies, but BJP is spreading lies about it
 unhone kaha, 'aaj mauka tha, wo bataa dete ki in coloniyon main registry kab shuru hogi or siver kii line kab dalegi
 They only know how to do politics
 sabase bada jhooth bolaa ki sarkari karmchaariyon kii umr nahin ghataaenge
 This is a copy of the order of the Haryana government
 haryana main sarkari karmchaariyon kii ritairement kii umr 58 saal kar di gai he
 Chief Minister Khattar Saheb was also present on the stage
 centre sarkaar bhi aisa order banaakar baithi hui he
 Everyone knows the employees of Delhi, their networking is very good
 'kejariwal bole, 'balb he yaa shigupha'bijli ke ahm chunavi mudde par kejariwal ne kaha, '6 maheene pehle desh main chunaav hue the
 In 6 months, he (BJP) did not fulfill his promise
 unhone dilli main 30 fisadi bijli ke daam ghataane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But in six months, in contrast, the price of electricity was increased twice
 you-turn liya, vaadakhilaphi kii
 Today, they have brought new Shigufa that they have a scheme
 koi balb lekar aae hai, jise lagane se saal main 300 rupee ke bill kam ho jayega
 300 rupees a year, i
e
 around 25 rupees a month
 ham kah rahe hai ki bijli ke bill aadhe karenge
 Meaning if someone's bill comes to 2000, then it will become 1000
 yani ab dilli kii janata ko tay karnaa he ki use maheene main 25 rupee bachaane hai yaa bill aadha karwaanaa he
 "quit 2022, what will you do now?" Arvind Kejriwal also reminded BJP of the promise of granting full statehood to Delhi
 unhone kaha, 'pichhali baar inhone dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 We are reminding him of his promise from day one
 lekin unhone apane bhaashan main usko bhi tavajjo nahin di
 Before the election, he promised not to break even a single slum
 lekin pichley 6 maheene ke andar dilli main ek ke baad ek jhuggiyaan todi gai hai
 Slums are broken in Vasant Kunj, Wazirpur and Okhla
 ye ab nayaa shagufa lekar aae hai ki 2022 tak sabko makaan denge
 So what will those who are still homeless do for seven years? 2022 kisne dekha he, ab kya karoge? gujarat main bhi inhone 5 lakh ghar banane kaa vaada kiya tha, 5 hajaar makaan bhi nahin bane
 The slogan is going on, when the BJP has come, the slums have come in trouble
 ''dharna dena bhi aata he or gavarnence bhi'aap sanyojak ne ek-ek karke modi ke sabhi jubaani hamalon par palatwaar kiya
 On the issue of corruption, he said, `` On corruption, Modi said that it took seven months to clean the PMO itself
 abhi secretary, dipti secretary, afasar, assistant afasar kii baari he
 Then when will your street number come? We ended bribery in 49 days
 bijepi parshadon kii baithak main bhi yah baat kahi gai thi
 Now there can be two reasons that either they do not know how to reduce corruption or their intention is bad
 karnaa nahin aa rahaa to hamen bataa den, ham sikhaa denge
 We know how to picket and govern
 ''mahilaayein bachche paidaa karne kii mashin hai?'kejariwal ne mahila suraksha ke masale or bijepi saansadon kii badjubaani ke bahaane bhi centre sarkaar ko gheraa

 angreji calendar ke anusaar maharana pratap kaa janm 9 may, 1540 ko hua tha
 If the Hindu calendar believes of Vikram Samvat, his birth anniversary is celebrated every year on Tritiya Tithi of Jyeshtha Shukla Paksha
 kaha jaataa he ki maharana pratan ek aise yodwa the jinhen mughalon ke aage jhukna manjuur nahin tha
 Maharana Pratana had chewed the enemies with the help of his small army
 aaie jaanate hai maharana pratap ke bare main kuch rochak or khaas baaten
 Maharana Pratap was born in Kumbhalgarh in Mewar, Rajasthan to Maharana Udai Singh of Sisodia dynasty and mother Rani Jeevat Kanwar
 maharana pratap ne kabhi kisi adheenta sweekaar nahin kii
 His name is immortal for his valor and determination in history
 itihaas kii maane to maharana pratap ko bachapan main kika kaha jaataa tha
 Not only this, it is also said that Maharana Pratap had done 11 weddings in his life
 haldighati kaa prasiddh yuddh maharana pratap or mughal badshaah akbar ke bich 18 june, 1576 i
 Was fought
 mana jaataa he ki maharana pratap or akbar ke bich yah yuddh mahabharat yuddh kii tarah vinaashkari siddh hua tha
 However, neither Maharana Pratap was defeated in this war nor Akbar could win
 kaha jaataa he ki akbar kii takat ko dekhne ke baavjood maharana pratap unke aage jhukne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Akbar tried to merge Mewar with his princely state by sending his envoy several times
 maharana pratap ke ghode kaa naam chetak tha, jo kaaphi tej daudta tha
 To save his king, he jumped over a 26 feet long drain
 maharana pratap ke ghode chetak kaa ek mandir bhi bana he jo aaj bhi haldi ghati main surakshit he
 Maharana Pratap's sword, armor is still preserved in the museum of Udaipur royal family

 Prior to Singh and Suu Kyi's meeting in Yangon, Foreign Minister SM Krishna said that Suu Kyi is one of Myanmar's important leaders and that the Prime Minister will meet in good faith and agree a national reconciliation to enrich the democratic process of this country It is only natural to wish them well
 yah puche jane par ki myamar main loktantr kii samruddhi main madad ke liye bharat kii kya patibaddhtaayen ho sakati hai, krishna ne kaha ‘‘loktantric prakriya ke liye or patibaddhtaayen jataane vaale ham koun ho sakate hai
 It is an independent, sovereign country with which we have diplomatic and other relations
 ’’ bharat main shikshit or nobel shanti puraskaar se sammanit 66 varshiya su chi ke saath singh kii mulaakaat, pradhanmantri kii myama ke raashtrapati thine seen se baatcheet ke ek din baad hogi
 In the last one year, credit for initiating political reforms in Myanmar goes to Thein Sein
 in sudhaaron ke kaaran myamar main maahaul bahut badla he jisaki badaulat hi singh raajnneetik daayre main vipaksh ke netaaon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 During the past few years, former President APJ Abdul Kalam and Vice President Hamid Ansari had come to Myanmar but could not meet the detained Suu Kyi then
 singh kii su chi se mulaakaat ko is baat kaa saaf sanket samajha ja rahaa he ki nayi dilli is loktantric kaaryakarta ke saath apane rishte majboot karnaa chaahati he
 It had previously faced criticism over Myanmar's ties with the former military junta
 agle maah 67 saal kii hone ja rahi su chi kaa nayi dilli ne hameshaa sammaan kiya he
 New Delhi gave him the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Award in the year 1993
 lekin suraksha or urja ke mudde tathaa myamar main china ke badhate prabhaav kii vajah se bharat ko apana ruukh badalanaa padaa jiske saath sainya junta se najdiki shuru hui
 India then invited former senior general Than Shwe on an official visit in 2004
 sutron ke anusaar, bharat ne myama ke gharelu raajnneetik vivaad main kisi kaa bhi paksh lene se hameshaa inkaar kiya or is desh ke netritv ke samaksh yah spasht kiya he ki vah kisi bhi sarkaar ke saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar he
 The meeting between Singh and Suu Kyi is taking place at a time when Suu Kyi's image is changing from a leader opposing the military junta to a political one in a democratic country
 yah badlaav do may se shuru hua jab su chi ne sansad sadsy ke taur par shapath lee
 Just a week before this, he had refused to take oath as per the constitution prepared by the army, which created a political crisis
 vah chaahati thim ki shapath sambandhi bayaan ke praaroop ke ek shabd ko badla jaae
 Suu Chi later changed his mind and was sworn in as a Member of Parliament
 yah raajnneetik bandi se sarkaar main loktantr ke nae charan ke liye unke sangharsh kaa ek or kadam tha
 Sui Chi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, was placed under house arrest for more than two decades and released in late 2010
 tab shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa hoga ki vah loktantr kii jujharu netaa se keval 18 maah main hi ek padaadhikari ban jaaengi
 The comments shapath lene vaale bayaan main su chi jis shabd ko badalanaa chaahati thim, use badalane bina baad main unke shapath lene se saaf pataa chalata he ki aane vaale samay main unhen koun si chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The army still has influence in Myanmar and the civilian government is the proxy government of the army
 raashtrapati thine seen kii sarkaar ne kai raajnneetik sudhaar kiye jinamein raajnneetik bandiyon kii rihaai, mulnivaasee vidrohiyon ke saath sanghasharviraam karnaa, media kii sensorship main chhot or sansadeey up chunaav karana aadi shaamil hai
 It is because of these by-elections that Sui Chi's National League for Democracy (NLD) has reached Parliament
 yangon main singh or su chi kii mulaakaat se pehle, videsh mantri es em krishna ne kaha ki su chi myamar ke mahatvapurn netaaon main se ek hai or pradhanmantri kaa sadbhaavnavash unase mulaakaat karnaa tathaa is desh kii loktantric prakriya ko samrudh karne ke liye rashtriya sulah sahmati kii khatir unhen hamaari shubhakamanaayen dena swaabhaavik he
 Asked what India's commitments could be to help the prosperity of democracy in Myanmar, Krishna said, "who can be the ones who make more commitments to the democratic process
" yah ek swatantra, samprabhu desh he jiske saath hamaare kootnithik or anya tarah ke sambandh hai
 Singh's meeting with 66-year-old Suu Kyi, who is educated in India and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, will take place a day after the Prime Minister talks to Myanmar President Thein Sein
 beete ek baras main myamar main raajnneetik sudhaaron kii pahal karne kaa shrey thine seen ko hi jaataa he
 Due to these reforms, the atmosphere in Myanmar has changed a lot, due to which Singh is meeting the leaders of the opposition in the political realm
 pichley kuch varsh ke dauraan purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam or up raashtrapati hamid ansaari myamar aae the lekin tab vah najarband su chi se nahin mil paae the
 Singh's meeting with Suu Kyi is seen as a clear indication that New Delhi wants to strengthen its relationship with this democratic activist 
 purv main use myamar ke purv sainya junta ke saath sambandhon ko lekar aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 New Delhi has always respected Suu Kyi, who is going to be 67 next month
 varsh 1993 main nayi dilli ne unhen pratishthit jawaharlal nehru award diya
 But the issue of security and energy and the increasing influence of China in Myanmar forced India to change its stand with which the military junta began its close proximity
 phir bharat ne 2004 main purv varisht general thaan shwe ko aadhikarik daure par aamantrit kiya
 According to sources, India has always refused to favor anyone in Myanmar's domestic political dispute and has made it clear to the leadership of this country that it is ready to work with any government
 singh or su chi ke bich mulaakaat aise samay par ho rahi he jab su chi kii chhavi sainya junta kaa virodh karne vaali netaa se badal kar loktantric desh kii ek raajnneetik ke taur par ban rahi he
 The change began on May 2 when Su Chi was sworn in as a Member of Parliament
 iske thik ek saptaah pehle hi unhone sena dwaara taiyaar samvidhan ke mutabik shapath lene se manaa kar diya tha jisase raajnneetik sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 She wanted one word in the format of the oath-related statement to be changed
 baad main su chi ne apana iraadaa badla or sansad sadsy ke taur par shapath le lee
 This was another step in his struggle from political captives to a new phase of democracy in government
 varsh 1991 main nobel shanti puraskaar se sammanit kii gayi su chi ko do dashak se bhi adhik samay tak najarband rakhaa gaya or 2010 ke aakhir main reeha kiya gaya
 Then hardly anyone would have thought that she would become an officer in only 18 months from a militant leader of democracy
 tippaniyan His subsequent swearing without changing the word Suu Kyi wanted to change in the sworn statement clearly shows what challenges he faces in the future
 myama main ab bhi sena kaa hi prabhaav he or asainya sarkaar sena kii hi chhadam sarkaar he
 The government of President Thein Sein made several political reforms including the release of political prisoners, ceasefire with indigenous rebels, relaxation of media censorship and holding of parliamentary by-elections
