 On the one hand, PM Modi is taking the initiative to abolish hundreds of laws applicable in the country, on the other hand, his own minister seems to have a tendency to bring some new laws
 ab swasthya mantralay desh main khule cigarette kii bikri par roak lagane ke liye kanoon main badlaav karne kii baat kar rahaa he
 An expert panel has recommended stricter measures to curb tobacco in the country, including one ban on the sale of open cigarettes
 isi tarah ek or sifarish he ki tambaakoo-cigarette kharidne kii nunatam umr badhaakar 18 se 25 saal kar di jaae
 Those violating them will have to pay a fine
 panel kii yah sifarish world health organijeshan ke kanvension se prabhavit he jisamen yah baat kahi gai he ki khule cigarette kii bikri ko nirutsahit kiya jaae
 The reasoning behind this is that children are attracted to open cigarettes
 nai sarkaar ne tambaakoo ke khilaaf ek jang chhedi he jiskaa swaagat kiya janaa chahie
 But then the same question arises whether any bad habit can be overcome by making laws
 Take the issue of alcohol
 kai rajyon ne sharabbandi kii or kade kanoon banaae
 But what happened? Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, etc
 all prohibited liquor in their homes, which did not yield any results
 ulate aparaadh bad gaye
 People involved in making money by smuggling liquor later started committing common crimes
 isi tarah sharaab kharidne ke liye umr seemaa tay karne kaa kanoon bana
 Everyone knows what his fate is
 ab tak kitne vikritaon yaa kharidaaron par is dhara ke tahat karrwai hui?darasal is tarah ke kanoon jab banate hai to inkaa karyanvayan bahut hi kathin hota he or police bhi kuch nahin kar paati
 On the contrary, it becomes a cause of corruption
 pulicekarmi vasuuli karne lag jate hai or phir yah dhandha chalata rahata he
 How will the government stop the sale of open cigarettes? To prevent this, only the police who already have the workload will do it
 kya sarkaar aisa kanoon banane se pehle usase poochhegi? aakhir vah kaise ise lagu karegi? desh kii har gali or har muhalle main cigarette bikta he
 How will these be monitored? Millions of people are making a living by selling cigarettes, tobacco and pan masala
 ab sarkaar police ko unase vasuuli kaa adhikaar dene ja rahi he
 One thing to understand here is that of course the Central Government should make laws, it is to be followed by the State Governments only because law and order is a state issue
 kai rajyon main kanoon-vyavastha kii haalat itani kharaab he ki unke bare main baar-baar charchaa hoti hi rahati he
 In such a situation, it is meaningless to talk of implementing such laws there
 kanoon sirf kitabon ke liye nahin hona chahie, uskaa paalan bhi hona chahie
 It would be better to ask those who follow that law whether it will be possible
 aakhir iskaa jimmaa unhen hi uthaanaa hoga or jab kanoon aisa ho ki uskaa taalluk har gali tathaa har muhalle se ho to use lagu karne ke pehle jarur sochna lenaa chahie
 Law cannot be cured for any social evil, but it can be overcome only by awareness
 janata ko uske dukhad parinaamon se avgat karnaa hi iskaa samaadhaan he
 We should learn from the way in which awareness has been spread among children against firecrackers
 desh ke bacchon main isse kaaphi jaagrukta paidaa hui or bade paimaane par bachche aaj pataakhon se dur rahete hai
 This applies to every bad habit
 kanoon banaakar aisi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan katai sambhav nahin he
 It would be better for the government to launch a big awareness campaign instead

 He has said that there will be no restriction on this at the moment
 siem nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'rajya main tambaakoo par koi pratibandh nahin lagaaya jayega
 However, he also said that farmers should consider the new option of cultivating khaini
 ' isse pehle kaha ja rahaa tha ki bihar sarkaar rajya main kheni ko pratibandhit karne par vichaar kar rahi he
 Because of this, it was speculated that the state government had written a letter to the Center recently
 is patr main kheni ko khaadya utpaada ke rup main suchit karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha
 After being notified as a food product by the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI), the government has the power to ban khaini on health grounds
 bihar ke pradhan sachiv (swasthya) sanjay kumaar ne kaha tha ki bihar main har paanchvaan shaks kheni kaa seven karata he
 He said that we have rules that govern the use of tobacco in the form of cigarettes, but consumption of khaini is high which needs attention
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki bihar main tambaakoo kii khapat main kul milakar giravat darj hui he
 However, the number of people consuming khaini (raw tobacco) has been worrying
 ye bhi paaya gaya he ki munh main cancer hone ke peeche kheni hi mukhya kaaran rahaa he

 hindustan shuru se aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par rahaa he
 But in this episode, now an conspiracy of the world's most maligned terrorist organization ISIS has been revealed which, if successful, would have caused great devastation in India
 anginat log sirf nafrat or koon-kharabe kii bhent chadh jate
 Rather, the enemies of the country would have a chance to weaken us
 magar, 15 agast yani swatantraaa diwas se thik pehle desh kii suraksha agenciyon ne is aatankwaadi saazish ko benaqaab kar naa sirf dushmano kii chulein hilaa deen, balki kai begunaah logon kii jaan bhi bachaa lee
 So what was this plot? And how was it disclosed? Let me tell you what it was - Operation Green Bird
 hindustan par 'aatank kaa parinda' mandara rahaa he
 Many cities, including the capital Delhi, are in danger
 ISIS ne dehshatgardi kii nai saazish rachi he
 Which is revealed by the group on the Telegram app
 swatantraaa diwas se ain pehle dhamaake kii planning kaa khulaasa hua he
 What is isis's Operation Green Bird? Intrigue Number 1- Bengali 138, Intrigue Number 2 - Islamic Hind, Intrigue Number 3- Flames of War, Intrigue Number 4 - al-mutarajim Foundation and Finally the Biggest and Most Dangerous Intrigue Number 5 i
e
 Green Birds
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki aakhir telegram app ke ye pejej kiske hai, iske myne kya hai or sazishon ke in pannon main akhir wo koun si baaten likhi hai, jisane suraksha agenciyon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he? to aaie silecelewar tareeqe se aapako puri kahani sunaae dete hai
 One is the policy of zero tolerance of the government against terrorism, the second is the elimination of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir and the third is the celebration of India celebrating Independence Day
 ye wo baaten hai jinhone hindustan ke dushmano ko baukhala diya he
 In any case, they want to kill innocent people by spreading disturbances somewhere
 hindustan ko koon ke aansu rulaanaa chaahate hai
 But before these terrorists could succeed in any such plan, the security agencies of India twisted the neck of isis's Operation Green Bird
 par, sawaal ye he ki akhir kya he iesas kaa oparation green bird? kya he iske myne? agar vakt rahete nahin khulata oparation green bird kaa raaj, to kya ho saktaa tha iskaa anjaam? to aaj vaardaat main ham ek-ek kar is oparation green bird ke tamaam raaj kaa khulaasa karenge
 First, let us tell you about the few pages of the telegram message of conspiracy
 aatankwaadiyon kii har harakat par nigaah rakhane or unka peechha karanevaali desh kii suraksha agenciyon kii nigaah achaanak isi saal 29 april ko iesas ke ek aise telegram group par padi, jise is aatankwaadi sanghathan ne bade khufia tareeqe se creat kiya tha
 The purpose of this group was not only to prepare the terrorists for the attack on India, but also to recruit them for this job
 kehane kii zarurat nahin he ki iske liye aatank ke aakaa isi group main naa sirf khufia tareeqe se apni puri saazish kaa raftaa-raftaa khulaasa kar rahe the, balki logon ke dilon-dimag main gair muslimon ke khilaaf zehar kaa wo khuraaq daalane main the, jisase paar paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 And this is the reason that the number of members of groups such as Bengali 138, Islamic Hind, Flames of War and Green Birds was continuously increasing and the strings of intrigue were also getting deeper
 lekin ain maukey par iesas kii is saazish kaa bhanda foot gaya
 These groups of terrorists were doing their job well, but in one such group, when the terrorists presented an objectionable picture of the Red Fort for the first time, the ears of the security agencies stood up
 is tasveere main aatankiyon ne naa sirf jald hi laal kile par hamalaa karne kii baat kahi thi, balki ye bhi likhaa tha ki jald hi hindustan ko bhi islam kii hukumat yani khilaafat kaa hissaa bana liya jayega
 In fact, in these groups, terrorists used to speak their language using code language, so that intrigue is not common
 or to or wo is baat kaa bhi khyaal rakhte the ki kahin koi gair shaks yaa police kaa mubir dhokhe se unke group kaa member naa ban jaae
 But that is exactly what ISIS feared
 di-code hua aatankwaadiyon ko code!hindustani agenciyon ne akhirkaar oparation green bird kaa code dicode kar liya
 According to this code, Green meant three cities of India, Delhi, Bhopal and Trivandrum
 jabaki bards B1RDS likhaa tha jisamen ai kii jagah van likhaa tha
 And in this, B-1 meant the train coach number B-1
 aar kaa matlab tha rajdhani express
 Whereas DS meant Delhi South
 is hisaab se dekhen to iesas ke aatankwaadi pandrah agast se ain pehle 13 agast ko south dilli ke kisi stesan yani nizamuddin se guzaranevaale kisi train yaa phir rajdhani express ke bi-1 coach main iidi ke zarie dhamaakaa karanevaale the
 For this, full training was being given to terrorists from making ieds to detonating them through mobile phones
 lekin isse pehle ki aisa ho paata, suraksha agenciyon ne naa sirf unka raaj fash kar diya, balki anginat begunaahon ko bemaut maare jane se bachaa liya

 aaj puure pradesh main 130 bal panchayaton main 3,250 bal patrkaar kaam kar rahe hai
 "journalists teach the tricks of journalism to teenagers elected from panchayats
 iske liye puure rajya main patrakarita kii har vidya main paarangat 72 bal patrkaar bataur prashikshak sakriy hai
 "before becoming a member of the core group, we are made aware of the nuances of news, feature, story writing and comics production," explains Nirmala, the core group member of Umang in Garsain
 iske alaava photo kheenchna, video va audio clip bananaa bhi sikhaaya jaataa he
 "deepa has traveled to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, on behalf of the monthly magazine editor Deepa Zhiquin Group to understand how children use media mediums
" in bacchon ko deshbhar main bal patrkaar taiyaar karne kaa prashikshan dene ke liye bhi bulaayaa jaataa he
 In November 2011, Renu Sakalani from Rudrayag and Anjana Juyal from Pauri Garhwal participated in the training program in Cambodia and Ghana
 deepa ko jaipur main rajasthan patrika se desk par kaam karne kaa ofer bhi mila he
 The Umang Group has also advocated questions related to children before the United Nations Children's Rights Committee
 is group kii kor samiti ke sadsy geneva main sanyukt raashtra bal adhikaar samiti ke saamne do baar apni report pesh kar chuke hai
 Gajendra Nautiyal recounts that the first-time children to go to Geneva were Lakshman Singh and Archana from a rural background and studied in junior high school at that time
 umang kii ore se geneva main yuansiarsi ke saamne uttarakhand main bal adhikaron kii sthiti ko lekar duusari baar vaikalpik report bhi pesh kii gai
 Newspaper medium was used in this report
 isamen bacchon kii samasyaon se jude samachar, feechar or comics kaa bharpoor istemaal hua tha
 Says Nautiyal, "the first such news report was submitted to a UN committee, which was highly appreciated
" '' is report ke baad centre va rajya sarkaar kii ore se kai sakaaratmak nitigat badlaav kiye gaye
 In the same month, the school made a report regarding the disaster management mechanism, in which child journalists from all 13 districts participated
 in bacchon kii patrakarita is arth main mahatvapurn he ki usne kai jaruri sawaalon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he, gambhir mudde uthaae hai or parivartan kii jameen taiyaar kii he
 By drawing a picture of a father beating a young child in one of his comics, the group drew attention to violence against children in Indian families
 yah bachche mukhya dhara ke patrakaron ke liye preranastrot ho sakate hai
 Respected Chief Justice of India, mujhe ummid he ki patiala house court main patrakaron, vakeelon or raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ke saath marpet kii ghatana se aapkaa naagarik or nyaayadhish man vyathit hua hoga
 Our courts detect the amount of poisonous carbon particles in the air and provoke all organizations
 waisi samvedansheel adaalaton par bharosa na karne kaa koi kaaran nahin banataa ki loktantr kii hawa karaab hote hi unhen fark nahin padegaa
 Rather, your institutions have extended the understanding of democracy from time to time more than politicians and academics
 adaalaton ke faisalon se loktantr kii vyakhya spasht hi hoti gai he
 What the group of lawyers did in the Patiala House Court is an attack on the years of achievement of the courts
 behad chunauteepurn samay main tamaam jajon ne loktantr ke haq main lambey-lambey faisale likhe, unki samaj or saahas kii viraasat par hamalaa hua he
 An incident like Patiala House Court will make it difficult to decide who the judge is
 kya vakeelon ko ijazat he ki ve samooh banaakar jaj ban jaaen or jaj se pehle adaalat parisar ke bheetar kisi ko apradhi yaa aatankwaadi sabit kar den? kya unhen adhikaar he ki mananeey adaalat ke parisar se logon ko maar maar kar baahar kar den? insaaf hona hi nahin chahie, hote hue bhi dikhnaa chahie
 If the reporter does not go to court, people will not go, then who will see justice being done
 koun batayega ki insaaf hua bhi he
 What happened in Patiala House Court on Monday is not normal
 vakaalat ke har skool college main yahi padhaayaa jaataa he ki sunwaayee kaa haq sabko he
 When the terrorists do not even get a lawyer, then the courts give a lawyer
 aparaadh kaa hona or aaropee kaa apradhi sabit hona iske bich kanoon kii kitni avasthaaen hai
 The process is fixed for each stage
 kya vakeelon ne insaaf ke is taqaaze par hamalaa nahin kiya he? ateet main kai vakeelon ne aatankwaadiyon kaa cese ladaa or baad main ve kin-kin dalon main pratishthit hue iskaa zikr nakaaratmak lahaze main nahin karnaa chahta balki kahana chaahunga ki un vakeelon ne aatankwaadiyon kaa cese ladke insaaf kii paribhaasha ko sarthak kiya he
 If the lawyers who beat up the Patiala House Court still have faith in their understanding, they should request the Bar Council not to read the chapter of the Law Colleges books from now onwards, from the killer to the terrorist
 It is right to have a lawyer
 apana paksh rakhane kaa haq he
 i would not have written this letter if the number of lawyers committing violence in Patiala House Court would have been one to two, but the journalists present there said that a large number of lawyers had turned to violence
 isse aapako bhi chintaa honi chahie balki hui bhi hogi
 It is not just about the Patiala court
 desh ke kai rajyon kii choti badi adaalaton main is tarah kii ghatana ho chuki he
 i request you to make an arrangement on this
 vakeelon se kahen ki aisa karnaa uchit nahin he
 In many district courts, i have seen that there is no proper seating arrangement for lawyers
 unke kaam karne kii sthiti bahut kharaab he
 When their family members see the place of work, then their self-respect will be hurt
 dilli kii kuch adaalaton main to sthiti behatar hui he par zila adaalaton main haalat bahut kharaab he
 They have to tie their table and chair to the chain
 agar aapaki pahal se is sthiti main kuch sudhaar ho jaae to mujhe acha lagegaa
 The Government of India should also take initiative for this
 sar, un vakeelon kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki patrakaron kii zarurat nahin he
 We want to know if the courts also think so
 ham patrakaron kii asuraksha bhi khuli chat ke neeche tiperiter lekar baithe vaqeel kii tarah hi he
 But as long as we are journalists and doing information work, is it not the responsibility of the institutions of democracy to keep us safe? a scared journalist produces a dead citizen in a democracy
 hamaari soochnaaon se naagarik sakasham hota he
 His faith increases
 ham agar ye kaam nahin kar paaenge to loktantr main sirf bheed hi paidaa hoti rahegi
 The job of journalism is not to create crowds but to create a competent citizen equipped with information
 tippaniyan We journalists have been killed
 yuddh ke morche par maare gaye hai
 Police bullets and leaders have been killed by operatives
 main yah patr isaliye nahin likh rahaa ki patiala court main patrakaron kaa maaraa gaya he
 If this trend continued to spread in the court premises, the lawyers would behave like political activists, then how would the poor man get justice
 kya aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki kisi corporate ke saath raajnneetik dal kaa yaarana ho jaae or donon milakar garibon ko visthapit kar den or jab ye garib insaaf ke liye adaalat kii dahleez par aaen to us dal ke samarthak vaqeel garibon ko vikaas virdohi, raashtra virdohi bataakar maarane lage
 What will happen then How insecure the citizen of the country will feel
 kamazor or garib hi corporate or raajnneetik nexs se sataae nahin jate hai balki madhyam varg bhi kabhi kabhi chapet main aa jaataa he
 Your time is valuable
 phir bhi aap in sab sawaalon ke jawaab ke taur par vyakhya den to ham sab kaa hausala badhegaa
 You are the guardian of democracy
 ek naagarik ke taur par aap hi hamaare adarsh hai
 i will forgive any errors in my writing
 sar, kya adaalat yah bharosa de paaegi yaa koi mukammal vyavastha karegi ki kisi bhi adaalat main vaqeel bheed banakar hinsa na karen
 i trust that there will be uneasiness about these questions in the judiciary's top people and the world of advocacy
 aapkaa, ravish Kumar, ek naagarik or patrkaar i hope that your citizen and judge will be disturbed by the incident of assault with journalists, lawyers and political activists in Patiala House Court
 hamaari adaalatein hawa main zahreele carbon kanon kii maatra ko bhaanp leti hai or sabhi sansthaaon ko khadkaa leti hai
 There is no reason not to rely on such sensitive courts that they will not be deterred once the air of democracy is bad
 balki aapaki sansthaaon ne rajanetaaon or academik logon se zyaada samay-samay par loktantr ke prati samaj ko vistaar diya he
 The judgments of the courts make the interpretation of democracy clear
 patiala house court main vakeelon ke samooh ne jo kiya wo adaalaton kii varshon kii arjeet uplabdhi par hamalaa he
 In a very challenging time, many judges wrote long-term decisions in favor of democracy, their legacy of understanding and courage has been attacked
 patiala house court jaisi ghatana se tay karnaa mushkil ho jayega ki jaj koun he
 Do lawyers have permission to form a group and become a judge and prove someone inside the court premises before the judge as a criminal or a terrorist? Do they have the right to kill people out of the premises of the honorable court? There should be no justice, it should be seen in spite of it
 agar court main reporter nahin jaaenge, log nahin jaaenge to insaaf hote hue koun dekhegaa
 Who will tell that justice has happened? somvaar ko patiala house court main jo hua he wo saamaanya nahin he
 Every school of advocacy is taught in the college that everyone has the right to be heard
 jab antkavaadi ko bhi vaqeel nahin miltaa to adaalatein vaqeel detii hai
 There are so many stages of law between the crime being committed and the accused being proved guilty
 har charan ke liye prakriya tay he
 Have not the lawyers attacked this argument of justice? In the past, many lawyers fought the case of terrorists and later on which parties they became prominent, they do not want to mention it in a negative tone but would like to say that those lawyers have made the definition of case justice of terrorists meaningful
 agar patiala house court main marpet karne vaale vakeelon ko ab bhi apni samaj par bharosa he to unhen baar council se guzarish kerani chahie ki ab se lau kalejon kii kitabon ke us chapter ko nahin padhaayaa jaae jisamen likhaa he ki hatyare se lekar aatankwaadi tak ko bhi vaqeel rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 They have the right to present their case
 patiala house court main hinsa karne vaale vakeelon kii sankhya ek do hoti to main yah patr nahin likhata lekin vahaan maujuud patrakaron ne bataaya ki badi sankhya main vaqeel hinsa par utaaru ho gaye the
 This should worry you too, but it must have happened
 baat sirf patiala court kii nahin he
 This type of incident has happened in small big courts of many states of the country
 main aapse guzarish karata hum ki is par ek vyavastha den
 Tell lawyers that it is not appropriate to do so
 kai zila adaalaton main maine dekha he ki vakeelon ke baithne kii uchit vyavastha nahin he
 Their working condition is very poor
 unke parivaar ke sadsy jab kaam karne kii jagah dekhte honge to unke aatm sammaan ko thes pahunchati hogi
 In some courts of Delhi, the situation has improved but in the district courts the condition is very bad
 unhen apni mez or kursi chen se baandh kar rakhni padati he
 i would love if your initiative improves this situation
 bharat sarkaar ko bhi iske liye pahal kerani chahie
 Sir, those lawyers also said that journalists are not needed
 ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya adaalatein bhi aisa sochati hai
 The insecurity of us journalists is like a lawyer sitting under a roof type with a typewriter
 lekin jab tak ham patrkaar hai or soochna dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai tab tak kya hamen surakshit rakhana loktantr kii sansthaaon kaa daayitv nahin he? ek daraa hua patrkaar loktantr main mara hua naagarik paidaa karata he
 Our information enables the citizen
 uskaa vishwaas badhata he
 If we are not able to do this work then only a crowd will be born in democracy
 patrakarita kaa kaam bheed paidaa karnaa nahin balki soochnaaon se las sakasham naagarik kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 The comments ham patrkaar maare gaye hai
 Have been killed on the war front
 police kii goliyon or netaaon ke gurgon se maare gaye hai
 i am not writing this letter because journalists have been killed in the Patiala court
 agar adaalat parisar main yah pravriti failati gai, vaqeel raajnneetik kaaryakarta kii tarah vyavhaar karenge to garib aadmi ko insaaf kaise milegaa
 Is it possible that a political party gets involved with a corporate and both of them together displace the poor and when the poor come to the court threshold for justice, the pro-poor poor of that party should be anti-development, anti-national He started beating after telling them
 tab kya hoga? desh kaa naagarik kitna asurakshit mahasoos karegaa
 The weak and the poor are not only persecuted by the corporate and political nexus, but the middle class also sometimes suffers
 aapkaa vakt keemati he
 Nevertheless, if you give an explanation as an answer to all these questions, then we will all be encouraged
 aap loktantr ke abhibhavak hai
 You are our ideal as a citizen
 mere likhane main jo chook hui ho use maaf kar dijiyegaa
 Sir, will the court be able to give credence or will it make any complete arrangement that violence should not happen in any court as a legitimate mob
 mujhe bharosa he ki nyaaypalika ke sheersh logon or vakaalat kii duniya main in sawaalon ko lekar bechaini hogi
 your, raveesh kumaar, a citizen and journalist patiala house court main vakeelon ke samooh ne jo kiya wo adaalaton kii varshon kii arjeet uplabdhi par hamalaa he

 australia ke is purv khilaadi ne kaha, ‘main ashes ko lekar utsuk hum
 i had previously predicted a 5–0 win but now i think the difference will be 10–0 as Australia finished the previous series 5–0
 ’ek brands ke liye yahaan pahunche maikgra ne kaha australian team bahut acha khel rahi he jabaki world cap ke nock out daur se baahar hone se england ke vishwaas main kami ai he

 Data released by the Association for Democratic Reforms shows that both these major parties have given tickets to a large number of leaders against whom serious criminal cases are going on
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi kii taraf se ghoshit 62 ummidavaaron main se 23 ke khilaaf aparaadhik or 14 aise hai jinpar gambhir aparaadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 Similarly, out of 126 Congress candidates, 33 criminal and criminal cases against 10 were found
 matlab 30 fisadi aise logon ko tikat mil chukaa he jinke khilaaf koi naa koi aparaadhik maamla chal rahaa he
 These figures have given the leaders of many other parties full opportunity to attack the two big parties of the country
 jediu netaa sharad yadav kehete hai ki samay aane par ham ye mudda uthaaenge
 Last time too, the public had defeated tainted leaders and this time will also teach the same lesson

 In such a situation, the question is that despite knowing why the parties are giving tickets to tainted leaders? Anyway, the names of many candidates are yet to be announced
 un ummidavaaron kii chhavi kisi hogi, yah bhi jald hi pataa chal jayega
 But a bitter truth is that if tainted leaders win and reach Parliament and later they are proved guilty then by May 2015 they too will be out of Parliament towards Lalu Yadav

 However, in such an alliance the governor has the discretion not to allow any possibility of horse-trading and invites the appropriate claimant to form the government

 Shahzad's sentence will be debated on Monday
 paanch saal pehle jamiya nagar ilaake ke bottla house main ek encounter hua tha
 Two terrorists were killed in that encounter
 dilli police ke ek jaanbaaj inspector emasi sharma bhi shahid hue the
 Now, after five years, the verdict of the court on the reality of this encounter has to come
 is faisle se kai baaten tay hongi
 The first of which is that what happened on September 13, 2008, was it exactly the same as is visible from the police documents or is it something else? Apart from this, the court is the only suspected terrorist in this case, Shahzad alias Pappu
 Can also be decided about
 police ne shahzad urf pappu ko uttar pradesh ke azamgarh se giraftaar kiya tha
 The police accuse Shahzad that the police encounter with the terrorists at the Batla House in Jamia Nagar was present in the same house where the terrorists were staying
 adaalat main daakhil police kii chargeshit ke mutabik shahzad hi vah aatanki he, jisane police par firing kii or uski hi ek goli se inspector asi sharma kii jaan gai
 In his charge sheet, the police have said that during that encounter, Shahzad along with his friend Junaid jumped from the balcony and escaped
 is maamle main police kii taraf se 29 april 2010 main daakhil kii gai chargeshit ke mutabik mohammad saf, mohammad aatif, amin urf bashir or mohammad sajid ko aaropee bataaya gaya he, jabaki usee chargeshit main ye bhi darj he ki do aatanki is encounter main maare gaye the
 According to the police, all these terrorists were from the Indian Mujahideen terrorist organization, which was involved in the Ahmedabad and Delhi blasts, and they were planned to carry out further blasts in Delhi
 is encounter main dilli police ne mohan chandra sharma jaisaa apana ek jaanbaaj sipaahi bhi khoyaa, lekin iske baad bhi yah encounter kaaphi sawaalon ke ghere main bhi rahaa samay-samay par kuch logon ne ise phek encounter kehane main bhi der nahin kii
 On the other hand, the Delhi Police is confident that their case is quite strong
 police ke mutabik enechaarsi kii report or hai court kaa faisla unke haq main he or is maamle ke tamaam saboot adaalat ke saamne hai
 Hence the police hope that accused Sahajad can be punished
 kya he batla house encounter cese19 sitambar 2008 ko hua batla house encounter kareeb dedh ghante tak chalaa tha
 In fact, the Special Cell of Delhi Police had received the news that the terrorists suspected of serial blast in Delhi on September 13, five days ago, were hiding in a house in Batla House
 iske baad police inspector mohan chand sharma ke netritv main us ghar ko gher leti he
 Inspector Sharma had killed 60 terrorists in his 21-year police job, while arresting over 200 dangerous terrorists and criminals
 lekin encounter specialist ke taur par mashhoor is jaanbaaj inspector mohan chand sharma ke liye batla house kaa yah encounter aakhri sabit hua

 However, according to the protocol, Scotland Yard will not look into the extradition request until the accused is produced before the court

 But the porn star that is in discussion these days is half Canadian and half Punjabi
 porn kii duniya main log is america ladki ko bele nox ke naam se jaanate hai, jabaki uskaa asli naam lauren he
 Well, the special thing is that the reason Lauren became a porn star is not very new, but is also not very popular
 darasal, duk uniwarsity main padhai karne ke liye vah porn star bani he
 According to the news, Lauren, who is doing graduation, has no option when her American doctor father and Indian mother posted in Afghanistan cut her education money
 aise main use mahangi padhai ke liye paise jutaney kaa ek hi tarika soojha
 But the bitter truth is that when his religious Catholic father returned home, he came to know that his daughter has become very famous now, but not because of the kind of hope a father might have

 vahiin, lauren kaa kahana he ki usne padhai puri karne ke liye yah rasta apanaaya
 Not only this, he claimed that high middle class and low income families are fighting the burden of debt

 Land acquisition of the previous UPA government of the Center is not responsible for the stalled projects in many states across the country
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik is baat kaa khulaasa RTI ke jariye hua he
 While the NDA government blamed the UPA government's land acquisition bill for the stalled projects
 darasal, centre keemodi sarkaarne pichhali sarkaar kii bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko deshbhar ke kai rajyon main ruke hue projectus ke liye jimmedaar bataaya tha
 The government had argued that the Land Acquisition Bill needs to be reformed to deal with such cases
 lekin activist venkatesh nayak ne RTI ke jariye jab ye jaanane kii koshish kii to sachai kuch or thi
 It has been revealed in the RTI that only 8% of the projects across the country are those which have been stopped due to the previous government's land acquisition bill
 zyaadaatar maamalon main paryaavaran vibhaag se clearence naa milane, builder ke paas paise kii kami yaa bazaar ko hi jimmedaar mana gaya he
 According to this RTI report sent by the Finance Ministry, there are 145 luxury projects out of a total of 804 projects, including hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes, golf courses and racing tracks
 saath hi sirf 11 aise projects hai jinamein 5 slam main rahane waalon ke basaane ke liye, 2 bajet home ke liye, ek old age home ke liye prastaavit he
 This report also revealed that 78% of most stalled projects are from private companies or people and only 22% of projects are government
 aaj kii bhagdaud bhari jindagi main agar koi cheez sabase adhik ast-vyast hui he, to vah he khanpan
 In this case, due to wrong habits, many such diseases are acquired at home, which we do not even know immediately
 khanpan ke sambandh main ayurveda main kai aisi mahatvapurn baaten he jinke bare main jaanakar ham kai bimariyon se batch sakate hai
 Eating certain things together can prove to be poison to the body
 yahaan ham aapako aise nau bemail khaadya padaarthon ke bare main bataa rahe hai jinka ek samay main saath khaanaa aapke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 1
 khaane se pehle or khaane ke turant baad falon kaa seven karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa haifal behad supachya hote hai
 But when these fruits combine with grains and reach the digestive system, they take time to digest
 pachan tantra main hi inkaa kindwan shuru ho jaataa he
 This causes damage to the intestinal walls and causes acidity
 2
 Consuming meat and starch is dangerous
 Meat contains rich protein
 aise main protein or carbohydrate kaa seven agar ek saath kiya jaae to donon hi poshak tatv phayda pahunchane ke badale nuksaan kar sakate hai
 Different digestive enzymes work in digestion of both and when both things are eaten together, there can be a reaction between enzymes
 isaki vajah se gas or pet main marod kii samasya ho sakati he
 3
 neembu ke saath cap seerup lene se ho sakati he pareshanineembu kii vajah se wo anzime straavit nahin ho pate hanjo cholestrol ko todane kaa kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, the main elements found in Kapha syrup do not break down and their full benefit is not available
 saath hi galaa block hone kii bhi ashanka bad jaati he
 4
 tamaato or carbohydrate kaa mail he khatarnakatmatar main amleey gun hota he or agar aap iske saath hi kisi haivi starch yaa carbohydrate se yukt cheez kaa seven karte hai to yah khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 This affects digestive function and may cause abdominal pain
 5
 Never eat together Use of fruits and yogurt and any dairy products together can prove dangerous
 isse sinus or saans se judi duusari samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 Eating yogurt with fruits in particular can be harmful
 raajnneeti main parivaar shabd thik nahin he magar yah unke saath bhi joda jaataa he jo duusare ke parivaarwaad kaa virodh karte hai
 Two families stood up against the politics of Congress's dynasticism
 janata parivaar or sangh parivaar
 But if you study the background of the representatives present in Parliament and Legislative Assemblies, then you will find that the whole of Indian politics is in the possession of the families
 naam ke liye kahin adhyaksh pad parivaar se free he to kahin pradhanmantri kaa pad
 Somewhere there is opposition to familism and somewhere there is agreement with the adversarial familyism opposing the front
 aaj dilli main ek parivaar bana he
 Public family mujhe yaad he raashtrapati pad ke liye chunaav ho rahe the
 The meeting was going on at the house of CPM leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet
 mulaayam apane ummidavaar par ade the
 Hundreds of media cameras were waiting outside Surjit's house
 mulaayam baahar aae or mike ko hataate hue kah kar chal diye ki koi morcha vorcha nahin he
 Today, when he saw the same Mulayam Singh Yadav sitting narrowly buried between Sharad Yadav and Deve Gowda, he felt how much time and age was spent
 jis netaji ko kisi ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye netaa nahin mana
 Sonia Gandhi refused to support, the leader today was accepted by the leaders of five other parties as her leader
 raajnneeti main aise milan hote rahe hai
 There have been many hugs from one to the other
 ramvilas paswan yahi kah kar raajnneeti karte rahe ki gujarat dangon ke baad mantrimandal se istipha dene kaa saahas akele unhone kiya he
 He is a minister in the Ram Vilas Paswan Narendra Modi government
 jo mulaayam singh yadav sonia gandhi se baghawat paale rahe vahi das saal tak unki party kii sarkaar bachaate rahe
 Therefore, on such occasions, the statements of ideal or old sentences have no meaning
 congress virodh ke naam par in pariwaron kaa udai hua tha
 The BJP also got the benefit of the Congress opposition but due to the union, the BJP continued to emerge as an organized party
 vahiin janata parivaar bikharata chalaa gaya
 But we will see carefully that this family is not erased
 gujarat main hi puri tarah mit jane kaa udhaaharan he
 Now no one knows where the party that gave the government of Chiman Bhai Patel went there
 lekin bihar, uttar pradesh, haryana, karnataka, urisa or jammu kashmir main iskaa kisi na kisi rup main vajood bachaa hua he
 Socialists have formed governments twice in many states
 urisa main to biju janata dal se nipatane ke liye bijepi ko aaj tak koi formula nahin soojha
 In UP, Mayawati formed the government with an absolute majority by making Mulayam Singh Yadav's Gundaraja an issue in 2007
 iske baad bhi 2012 main akhilesh yadav kii cycle ne sabko peeche kar diya
 Nitish Kumar was formed twice
 bijepi ke alag hone ke baad bhi apni sarkaar bachaane main safal rahe
 Even after it was felt that Narendra Modi and BJP had taken Jeetan Ram Manjhi under their influence and it was easy to disband Janata Dal United, the Janata Parivar was successful in saving its existence and Nitish again became the Chief Minister
 kul milakar raajnneeti ke is hisse main bikharane or tuutane kaa anubhav he to satta khokar hasil karne kaa bhi anubhav he
 They have come to rule over the years
 ab ve congress virodh vaala vipakshi khemaa nahin rahaa
 This is also a ruling class of Indian politics
 agar inkaa vajood itnaa hi kamazor hota to jammu kashmir main janata parivaar kaa hissaa rahi pidipi se bijepi ko haath milaane ke liye majaboor na hona padataa
 Therefore, the Janata Parivar cannot be dismissed on the basis of history
 1977 se 1990 ke bich janata parivaar kisi na kisi tareeke se judata rahaa or use kai baar pradhanmantri banane kaa mauka bhi mila lekin inaki sabase badi yahi uplabdhi rahi ki inhone gathbandhan ko asthirataa se jod diya
 The people, considering it a reality, continued to choose the alliance on the basis of the party that gave stability
 lekin unki sarkaron kii ekmaatr kamyaabi asthirataa hi nahin rahi hogi
 The Janata Parivar began to disintegrate from the year of 1990
 sabaki apni apni party ho gai or sab apni apni party ke netaa
 Nobody knew that a person named Narendra Modi would enter his stronghold
 raajnneeti ke is samaajawaadee dhade kii ek aitihaasik pravriti or he
 They are always united in front of their strong opponents or enemies
 jai prakaash narayan ke netritv main ye kahin se bhi aa gaye, kisi se bhi mil gaye
 But later their existence did not depend on the presence or absence of Congress or BJP
 indira gandhi ke baad ye pehali baar ho rahaa he ki janata parivaar ke puraane bhaaiyon ko gaanv kii yaad aa rahi he
 Where they have gone again to find the head of the joint family
 taaki is baar ek nae virdohi se ladaa jaae
 BJP should be united in the name of protest
 kya hoga koun jaanata he, jo ho rahaa he use to dekha hi ja saktaa he

 The BJP has made the watchman a big weapon for Rafale to sabotage the Congress's watchman thief
 bijepi ne apane nae naare main bhi chaukeedaar ko desh bhar main pahunchane kii muhim ched di he
 Team Modi started the Main Hoon Chowkidar campaign a few days ago
 pradhanmantri ne khud apane twitor handle par naam ke aage chaukeedaar jodakar is muhim kii shuruyaat kii or phir to ye silsilaa chal padaa
 BJP President Amit Shah, all Union Ministers, all big leaders adopted the watchman tag
 ab bijepi chaukeedaar vaale naare ko jan-jan tak pahunchane main jute gai he
 Today, there will be a mega program at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself will connect with more than 500 areas of the country

 Rahul Gandhi surrounded the BJP with this slogan in every assembly

 The term Chowkidar for himself was also used by PM Modi in 2014
 tab pradhanmantri modi ne khud ko chaukeedaar bataate hue congress ko bhrashtachar par gheraa tha
 In 2014, Narendra Modi said that you do not make me Prime Minister, do not make me a janitor
 main dilli main chaukeedaar kii tarah baithunga or aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum
 You will set such a watchman that no one will allow you to fall on the chest of India

 Ache din anyone? kiran bedi ne kaha ki dilli main takaraav hota he to nuksaan hota he
 We have lost governance in this one year
 par unhone yah nahin bataaya ki is ek saal main kasam garvanence ke naam par chunaav kyon nahin hue
 It was not that she was speaking just like a lecher
 unke bheetar kaa ek netaa bhi tha, jo aane vaale dinon main or ubharegaa
 Delhi bjp's search for a leader has been completed, but Kiran Bedi's quest to become a leader is beginning
 bedi ne kaha ki bijepi kaa kaaryakarta saamaajik sudhaarak banegaa
 Will be engaged in cleaning the slums from now itself
 pradhanmantri ne kaha he ki jahaan jhuggi vahaan makaan lekin main kahati hum ki svachh jhuggi, svachh makaan
 There are three weeks left in the election
 bijepi jaanati he ki aam aadmi party kaa saamaajik aadhaar kahaan hai, isliye jhuggiyon main makaan banane or safai karne ke sahare vah vahaan aap ko chunauti degi
 Arvind Kejriwal also held a dialogue program in Trilokpuri on Friday evening to regularize the colonies
 kiran bedi ke swaagat sthal se thodi hi dur par bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh talkatoraa stadium main bol rahe the
 Where BJP organized Dalit Conference
 dilli main 25 pratishat dalit hai or 12 reserve siten hai
 In the last election, the Aam Aadmi Party had got 9 seats
 bijepi ko sirf do siten mili thim
 So the battle of Delhi is not only happening on the face level, the role of castes and localities is also coming out
 kiran bedi akele shaamil huin to shazia ilmi ko kai or netaaon ke saath bijepi main shaamil kiya gaya
 Shazia met BJP national president Amit Shah and became a member
 unke saath di loyan of punjab, jimi, singh sahab di great, agnipath, haale dil, shoot out at lokhandwala, masti jaisi mashhoor filmon ke sangeetkaar anand raaj anand bhi shaamil hue
 Shazia said that she will not contest elections, will work for the party
 aam aadmi party kii kathani or kerani kaa fark logon ko bataaengi
 Meanwhile, Ajay Maken told the Nidhi Vice Chancellor that Kiran Bedi lied to get into politics
 inaki beti ke medical main admician sahi tareeke se nahin hua tha ye sab tathy saamne laae jaaenge
 BJP has fielded Kiran Bedi in the posters
 daftar ke baahar lage poster main satish upaadhyaay aage hai or kiran bedi peechhein
 But today's speech made it clear who is behind
 acha he kiran bedi ne apni soch kaa ek khaakaa rakh diya
 Maybe she will say more things in the coming days, but whatever she said today, she felt that she is declaring from her side that the bjp's chief ministerial candidate is there

 The Aam Aadmi Party's traders wing has strongly objected to the Chief Minister's decision and has also threatened to shut down Delhi to protest if the decision is not reconsidered in the cabinet meeting
 sarkaar ne nahin kii apni hi party ke treders wing se koi charchaa!alag-alag treders association ne kejariwal sarkaar ke is faisle ko sarkaar kii anti-tryder policy kaa hissaa bataate hue virodh pradarshan kaa maahaul bananaa shuru kar diya he
 Convenor of aap's Traders Wing, Brajesh Goyal said that calls from more than 100 merchant groups have come to him on the sudden decision of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and all the merchant organizations are shocked
 dilli main pehle se hi nunatam vetan baaki rajyon kii tulana main tees fisadi tak zyada he
 In such a situation, there is no point of increasing 50 percent
 goyal ne kaha ki party main loktantric tareeke se is masale ko uthaaya jayega
 The traders want the cabinet meeting to be reconsidered and the decision taken back
 is baat par aage jate hue goyal yah bhi kehete hai ki party ke treders wing ke liye vyapaariyon ke hit sarvopari hai or agar sarkaar faisle par kaayam rahati he to dilli band kar tryder wing apni hi sarkaar ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan kiya jayega
 If this decision comes into force, then all industries will start migrating from Delhi because doing business in Delhi will become a loss deal
 kya kejariwal chaahate hai ki ham kaam-dhandha band kar den?enditie yani nai dilli treders association ke mahasachiv vinay bahal kehete hai ki vot maangate hue kejariwal ne kaha tha ki sarkaar har tabake ko saath lekar chalegi lekin ab vyapaariyon ko puri tarah bhula diya gaya he
 Considering the way anti-trader decisions are being taken, it seems that business will have to be stopped

 Comparing the ongoing agitation against corruption in the country with fireworks, Govardhanamath Puri Peethadhishwar Nischalananda Saraswati said that such movements are like firecrackers that are first shone and then puffed up

 He said that to carry forward the movement against corruption in a positive direction, spiritual and religious guidance is needed and those running the movement for prevention of corruption and political reforms should also have taken religious guidance
 saraswati ne kaha, ‘aise andolan aatishbaajee kii tarah hai jo pehle chamakate hai or phir phuss ho jate hai
 He said that the reservation system in the country is a hindrance to progress
 unka maananaa he ki is vyavastha se pratibha kii haani hoti he
 He said that nowadays politics has taken the place of Rajdharma and chaotic elements have come to dominate, so cultural consciousness is needed

 Have you ever thought, come back home from your office or somewhere else, and before you unlock the lock, you get rooted in panic, because there are two pythons hanging from the roof of your house, which appear to be 'very angry'
 , And fighting each other
 
 
 ji haa, queensland (australia) main based ek parivaar ke saath sachmuch yahi hua
 
 
 On the social networking website Facebook, 'sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24 / 7' has posted a video of a creeping video on its page, in which two very large sized pythons are seen fighting each other hanging from the ceiling
 
 
 video ke saath pej par likhaa gaya he, "sanpon main garbhadhaaran kaa vakt shuru ho gaya he, so agle do maheene tak puure tateey ilaake main nar ajagaron ke bich is tarah ke jhagade dikhaai dena bahut saamaanya baat hogi

 Oh my God
 
 
 ! By the way, we are quite sure that you too must be thinking on this line, because the second thought that came to our mind was, what if these pythons bite each other while fighting, or say that in this way What do these pythons want to achieve by fighting? 
 
 is sawaal ke jawaab main sunshine coast sneke cachars ke ek sadsy kaa kahana tha, "ye ajgar ek duusare ko katate nahin hai, yaa ek duusare kaa dam ghontne kii koshish nahin karte, kyonki is ladaai kaa uddeshy sirf khud ko shaareerik rup se zyaada taqatvar sabit karnaa hota he

 manchester main team india or newjiland ke bich khele ja rahe world cap 2019 ke pehle semifinal main barish ne khalal daal diya
 The rain knocked in the match at a time when Team India had strengthened their grip in the match
 team india ke tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar jab 47wein over kii duusari gend phenkane ja rahe the tabhi barish baadha banakar ai
 New Zealand's innings 46 until rain came
 1 overon main 5 wicket ke nuksaan par 211 par thi
 New Zealand's experienced batsmen Ross Taylor and Tom Latham were at the crease
 aise main ab ye sawaal uthta he ki barish ne kis team ko phayda pahunchaa
 Will rain help New Zealand or will it be a vane for Team India
 🔷 🇮🇳 need to bat at least 20 overs for a result🔷 If possible, a result will be reached today🔷 If not, the game will continue tomorrow🔷 If still no result is possible, 🇮🇳 will progress to the # cwc19final, as group winners # indvnzhttps: / / t
 co / xim0zbscug — Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) July 9, 2019 By the time the match stopped, there were two conditions
 pehali ye ki match main DLS Method kaa istemaal kiya jaae yaa rigerv de ke din match ko phir vahiin se shuru kiya jaae jahaan se khatm hua tha
 The ICC was trying to end this match today
 aisa DLS Method kaa istemaal kar hi ho saktaa tha
 This meant that overs were reduced and India would have got a set target
 agar DLS Method lagu hota to team india ko kya target miltaa?46 over main banane hote 237 ran40 over main banane hoto 223 ran35 over main banane hote 209 ran30 over main banane hote 192 ran25 over main banane hote 172 ran20 over main banane hote 148 ranaise main ye sthiti bharat ke liye phydemand nahin rahati
 Previously, if the rain did not disrupt the match, then the way Team India held New Zealand, it would have given them a target of 240 or 250
 aise main is score se team india ke captain viraat kohli bhi santusht hote
 The match has to be started on Reserve Day, in the reserve conditions second to none for Team India
 yani ki newjiland kii pari 47wein over kii duusari gend se shuru hogi or use 23 gendon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The Indian team will have to bat most of the day on Reserve Day
 use puure 50 over milenge
 In such a situation, the Indian batsmen will come out to bat fully refreshed
 47 over kii gendbaaji ke baad khilaadiyon ko aaraam karne kaa bharpoor mauka milegaa
 Team India all-rounder Hardik Pandya walked out of the ground for some time today after suffering from upper leg pain, he will also get a chance to rest
 vahiin, agar rigerv de main bhi barish hoti he or match shuru nahin hota he to match kaa nateeja points ke base par nikaala jayega or jis team ke zyada point honge, vah final kaa tikat paaegi
 India is on top in the points table, while New Zealand is in fourth place
 aise main bharat ko final kaa tikat milegaa
 Overall, the Indian camp must be celebrating that there is no match today and the match starts on Wednesday

 is film kaa nirdeshnameghna gulzarkar rahi hai
 His opposite Vikrant Messi will be seen in the film
 film kii kahani acid atake cerviver lakshmi agarwal ke jivan par aadhaarit he
 You must have often heard people say that life changes completely after marriage
 par kya ye vaaki sach he? pehle to ye jaan lenaa bahut jaruri he ki jindagi badal jane kaa matlab nakaaratmak hi ho, ye jaruri nahin
 These changes can also be positive
 shaadi hone ke saath hi do log, do parivaar ek ho jate hai
 It is possible that the synergy between you and your partner is so good that every difficult life seems to be small, but it should not be so
 kai maamalon main do logon ke bich talmail nahin ban paata or jindagi boj lagane lag jaati he
 But no situation arises in a day
 aap donon ke bich sabakuch sahi nahin haito iske lakshan shuruyaat main hi najar aane lagenge
 If something similar is happening to you too, then it is time for you to recover
 isse pehle kii sabakuch barbaad ho jaae, sthiti ko sambhaal lenaa behatar rahegaa
 1
 paise kii baat par ladaikya aap donon ke bich har roj paise bachaane or kharch karne kii baat par bahes hoti he? kya aap donon ke bich paison ko lekar talmail nahin ban paa rahaa or isaki vajah se ghar kaa bajet bighad rahaa he? agar haa, to ye aapke liye sanbhalane kaa vakt he
 2
 kya aapkaa partner dusron ko zyada tavajjo detaa he?kya aap donon ke bich ek khalipan he? kya aapke saath aisa hota he ki aap apane partner ke saath baithe hote hai or wo mobile par dusron se baat karne main biji rahata he? use is baat se fark nahin padataa he ki aap uske saath baithe hai or aap donon ek acha vakt bitaa sakate hai? agar aapke ghar main bhi aisa hona roj kii baat ho chuki he to behatar hoga, sanbhal jaaie
 3
 kya aap donon kii soch alag he?aapako ghoomana pasand he or aap kisi din baahar ghoomane kaa plan banaate hai lekin aapkaa partner jane se manaa kar detaa he
 If this happens to you too, there is no thinking between you and your partner about any plan, then be concerned about your relationship
 4
 Does your partner like to spend the night with friends? Does your partner like to stay with his friends at night? Has this become his habit? If yes, then understand that everything is not right between you and they are ignoring you

 har ladki kii khwaahish hoti he ki uski shaadishuda jindagi hameshaa khushhaal rahe
 Every girl also tries for this, but sometimes we inadvertently make such small mistakes that ruin our relationship
 ye aadaten dhire-dhire aapaki khushhaal shaadishuda jindagi ko grahan laga detii hai or hamen pataa tak nahin chalata he
 We are going to tell you that due to small mistakes, you are ruining both your husband and marriage
 1- paise kharch karne ke maamle main naadaani-ek kahawat he ki jitani chadar ho, utana hi pair pasaarna chahie
 Every wife should spend her household income keeping in mind and make a budget
 aap agar paison ke maamle main samajhadaar nahin hai to yah aapako baad main mahangaa pad saktaa he
 It is not a good thing to keep constantly complaining about the lack of luxurious things
 agar aapke pati karj main doobenge to isse un par tanaav badhegaa or aisi sthiti main aapse bhi manmutav ho saktaa he
 You may not be able to buy the bag that you have been wanting to buy for months, but your husband will surely appreciate that you respect him and you are happy in what he offers you
 Huh
 isse ek-duusare ke prati pyaar or sammaan donon badhata he
 These are 7 habits, you will prove bad husband 2 - Constantly negative things - You hate your hair, the noise around the house, the behavior of neighbors, the dumb colleague of your office, the bad work of a maid
 har vakt agar aap har kisi kii shikaayat karti rahati hai to iskaa aapke hi rishte par bura asar padataa he
 May be your criticism is right at times, yet you should not do evil to everyone in front of your husband
 isse unke man main aapaki ek nakaaratmak chhavi banati chali jaaegi
 As soon as your husband enters the house, you should remove all the negative things from your mind
 ladakon ko chizon ko suljhaana pasand hota he or agar aap shikayaton ke dher se unhen gher lengi to shaayad vah aapse dur hote chale jaaen
 Every man wants to keep his wife happy but if he realizes that he is not able to do it then he gets frustrated
 kabhi-kabhi unase shikawa karnaa to thik he lekin ise apni dincharya main shaamil naa kar len
 3- Always keep other things in your priority - When your child, mother, friend or career comes in front of you, you ignore your husband and make them realize that they do not have any special importance in your life
 sochie ki har roj, kai saalon tak aapako lagaataar yah jataate rahe to aapako kaisaa lagegaa? yakeenan aapaki bhaawanaaon or aapke aatmavishvaas ko thes pahonchegi
 Nowadays, one of the reasons for the divorce of many couples is that they do not take care of each other and do not give importance to each other
 aisi galati anjaane main bhi naa karen
 4 - Running away from expressing love - Every husband also wants a physical effect from his wife
 agar aap lagaataar unase dur bhaag rahi hai to unhen yah bura lag saktaa he
 Never control Intimacy as a weapon to control your husband
 aapke rishte main pyaar or romance aapke rishte ko majboot karne ke liye jaruri he
 5- Do not do everything in a gesture - If you want to say anything important to your husband, then tell him in easy and clear language
 uske liye aap sanketon main baat naa karen jinhen aapke pati samaj hi naa paaen
 Tell your feelings honestly
 agar vah aapse poochhate hai ki kya hua he to 'kuch nahin' kahkar unase sab kuch samaj lene kii ummid naa karen
 If you say everything round and round, it will only make your relationship more complicated

 This is the area that will go to the polls in the shadow of the riots
 yahaan bijepi, sapa-congress gathbandhan, basapa ke saath hi choudhary ajit singh bhi siyaasi maidan main hai
 Everyone has their own strategy, but the strategy of alliance and BSP is most interesting
 akhilesh or rahul kii ranneetidarasal, pashchimi upi ko congress or sapa kii kamazor kadi mana ja rahaa he
 The SP has already been weak in this Jatland, as Yadav voters are very few here
 aise main congress ke sahare sapa muslim vot bank ko apane paale main laane main juty he
 But he is afraid that in the name of BJP opposition, Muslim votes should not go to the bsp's court because BSP also has the base vote of Dalits
 isiilie sapa or congress ek taraf to jat netaa ajit singh par nigahen gadaaye hai
 They feel that Chaudhary will harm the BJP
 duusari taraf, wo puure pashchimi upi ko jor-shor se bataaenge ki, upi menmayawati 3 baar chunaav ke baad gathjod kar chuki hai, aage bhi kar lengi
 At the same time, the attempt is to make the battle of western UP versus BJP, so that the Muslim voters remain in the alliance and in the cross-border battle, the votes of the BJP opposition and the Muslim vote will cross the alliance
 isiilie congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi apni sabhaaon main nishane par bijepi ko rakh rahe hai
 According to the strategy, Rahul Gandhi says that i do not think it is necessary to talk about BSP because it is not in the fight
 saath hi 11 farvari ke din jab pehle charan kaa matdaan hoga, usee din piem ke sansadeey kshetra banaras main rahul,akhilesh 5 ghante kaa saajha road sho kar rahe honge, jisase pashchimi upi ke pehle charan ke matdaan par asar daal saken
 Mayawati, who became the CM of Mayawati's Jat Land Plan by creating a dalit-brahmin equation in 2007, has changed her strategy this time
 tab mayawati ke saamne bijepi badi chunauti nahin thi
 This time Mayawati has entered the electoral arena with a new strategy
 is baar mayawati ne dalit-muslim sameekaran ko aadhaar banaaya he, jiskaa sabase bada imtihaan pashchimi upi main hi hona he
 Mayawati has fielded over 100 Muslim candidates from here
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan mayawati bijepi par zyada hamalavar rahati hai
 He even joined hands with the Ansari brothers of Bahubali and tainted image to convey the message to the Muslims, because of whose tainted image Akhilesh collided with mulayam-shivpal and did not allow him to join the SP
 aise main ab gathbandhan kii tarah hi mayawati bhi ladaai ko basapa banaam bijepi bananaa chaahati hai
 In such a situation, Maya feels that in the wake of the Dalit base vote, with the help of 100 Muslim candidates, the Vodalit Muslim alliance will be able to gain the BJP opposition vote
 isiilie mayawati kahati hai ki, congress to kahin he nahin or sapa main jhagade ke chalate sapa hi sapa ko haraa rahi he, isliye bijepi ko haraane ke liye gathbandhan ko vot dena vot kharaab karnaa hoga
 The bjp's simple and simple policy, as much as the BSP and the alliance talk about Muslim voters, the BJP feels that without doing anything Hindu voters will mobilize in its favor, so that it will also make a dent in the Dalit vote bank
 saath hi uski ummid he ki, basapa ne 100 se zyada muslim ummidavaar utaare hai, to vahiin akhilesh ne congress se gathjod karke tay kar diya he ki, muslim matadaata do jagah bantega aurabijepi kii raah aasaan ho jaayegi
 Also, BJP feels that it has a trump card as Narendra Modi
 kul milakar upi kaa dangal koun jitegaa isaki neenv pashchimi upi se hi rakh di jaayegi
 At the same time, everyone feels that the initial phase which will come out in the election of seven phases, the atmosphere will be in its favor in the coming stages
 isiilie filhal to pashchimi upi puure upi kii siyaasi disha tay karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ko taiyaar he

 notebandi ko ek saal puraa ho gaya
 Farmers say that they have only killed a year
 kisaanon kaa aarope he ki cashles tranjection ne bhi unke bure haal kiye hai
 How did a farmer spend the entire year like this? 
 
 ye samajhane kaa prayaas kiya 'ajtak' ne
 On visiting the main vegetable market of Pune, it was found that onion market has increased these days
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki pichley maheene lagaataar barish hone se nai pyaaj kii fasal barbaad hui he or isiilie jin kisaanon ke paas purana pyaaj rakhaa hua tha unhen acha munafa ho rahaa he
 Onion from Vinayak Kothale farmer who grows onion crop in Sangvi Surya village of Ahmednagar district has received a price of forty rupees
 lekin iske baavjood uske chehere par khushi nahin jhalak rahi he
 According to Vinayak Kothale, a farmer from Ahmednagar district, due to demonetisation, now farmers have started getting crop money very late
 cash paisa to milegaa nahin, or check bhi ek maheene baad uske haath aayega
 The trader gets the check a month after selling the crop, and the check is passed eight days later
 jisase vinayak ko ghar chalaane main or kheti main kaam karne vaale mazdooron ko paise dene main bahut dikkatein aati hai
 The same is true of other farmers
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki notebandi se kisaanon kaa bahut nuksaan hua he
 The laborers who work in the field are not educated and they do not agree to give their account check or do RTGS
 isiilie unhe nagad paise dene padate hai or bank se do hajaar kii note milti he to mushkil ja rahi he
 Farmer Bachhindra Bhakre explains, "before demonetisation, the farmer used to sell his goods at the farm dam, but now traders do not come to buy goods in farming
 paise transfar karne main takalif hoti he
 If the merchant gives us the check, the check is not cleared for 20 days
 kisaan ko paise kii bahut jarurat hoti he
 Today, onion has got a slight price but last year there was nothing
 principal bhi nahin niklaa
 "the team of 'aajtak' arrived in the area to know how farmers do their passing in Sangvi Surya village in Ahmednagar district
 maaloom padaa ki adhiktar kisaan saal main do baar hone vaali fasal or use bechakar hone vaali aamadani par puure saal guzaara karte hai, notebandi ke saath-sathcashales tranjectionke kaaran vinayak jaise anya kisaanon ko dohari maar jhelni pad rahi he
 With Govind Dhumal and his family having no money, he is also finding it difficult to make ends meet
 govind dhumal kii kahani bhi thik waisi hi he
 They do not receive money for two months by paying with a check
 jisase unki haalat kharaab he
 He says that the rain has been good this time
 fasal bhi acchhee nikali he
 But due to lack of money, they have to go to the bank for two days and due to lack of operating cashless system, a merchant has not given them money for a year
 unhen check bhi likhnaa nahin aata jisase unke das check kharaab ho gaye hai
 Workers are also worried about not giving money to the workers on time
 govind dhumal ne bhi ek saal se kisaanon ke haal sunaae, "pyaaj kii kheti karte hai, do-chaar acre pyaaj ugaate hai, kharchaa bahut he lekin keemat utani nahin milti
 The check comes from the merchant but no money is being received
 kyonki check bouns bhi hota he
 Payment gets delayed
 majdoor utane din rahete nahin he
 If money does not come quickly, workers do not stop
 ghar kaa kharchaa chalaanaa bhi mushkil ho jaataa he
 Petrol, diesel and other expenses become the problem
 majdoor chale jate hai to loding karne main mushkil aati he
 There is such a problem
 "kheti main kaam karne vaale mazdooron ke bhi bure haal hai
 Ujjwala Rajaram Dhawale told how he gets the payment from the check and then the laborers who work in the field take money every day to eat bread
 bahut choti-choti problem hai
 There is a lot of food for people associated with farming
 notebandi or cashles tranjectionke bich fanse hai majdoor-kisaan or vyapaaree
 The workers are worried that the farmer does not pay
 kisaan pareshaan he ki vyapaaree check deree se de rahaa he
 The businessman is upset that if the cash is not in his hands - the farmers have to send it empty
 kul milakar bazaar main ek saal baad teji aane ke baavjood kisaanon ke chehre par khushi nahin he
 Things like Pune, Ahmednagar, Nashik are not limited to western Maharashtra only, even today the cash is seen in vegetable mandis across the state
 paisa haath main nahin milane ke kaaran bazaar se shuru hone vaali mushkil kisaan or mazdooron ke ghar tak pahunchate-pahunchate or bhi badi ho jaati he
 According to farmers, for the last one year, people dependent on agriculture are living their lives by cutting their stomachs

 Akshay Deshmane of Huffington Post has done a long story about the claim of Ease of Doing Business
 akshay ne likhaa he ki is rapat ke liye unhone baithkon ke minutes ke saikadon panne dekh liye hai
 Have talked to many prominent people and seen government correspondence as well and then reported it
 report 20 november ko chhapi he
 The report is how the Modi government made changes in the ranking process by lobbying with the World Bank to improve the ranking
 jab usase kamyaabi nahin mili to kuch maamuli sudhaaron ke zarie ranking ko hasil karne kii koshish kii gai
 Economists like Lavish Bhandari say that the World Bank in turn influenced India's economic reforms
 akshay ne soochna ke adhikaar se kai dastauez hasil kar dikhaaya he ki kaise vitt mantri jetali ne pratiyogi pariksha kii chaalu tarkeebon kaa istamaal kar rekking main sudhaar hasil kar liya or koi thos badlaav bhi nahin kiya
 It also did not benefit the economy significantly
 modi sarkaar ke shuruaati daur main vitt sachiv rahe arvind mariyam ne sawaal kiya he ki agar ranking sudhar rahi he to nivesh kyon nahin bad rahaa he
 India's 2011 ranking of Ease of Doing Business was not good when investment was 38 per cent of GDP in 2011, but when it became very good in 2018, then why the investment is 27 per cent of GDP
 aap khud bhi is report ko padhein or samajhen
 The Business Standard reports Ishaan Bakshi's November 26 Daily Employee Provident Fund (EPFO) data
 isse judane vaale karmchaariyon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki logon ko naukariyaan mil rahi hai
 The data shows that this number is seen to increase because the company gets a government grant due to the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY)
 is laabh ke liye jo log pehle se naukari main the vahi zyaadaatar jude hai
 It does not show that new jobs have increased or people already working are involved to take advantage of the scheme
 ishan ne likhaa he ki zyaadaatar 15000 se kam kii selary vaale logon ko PMRPY kaa laabh miltaa he
 This also shows at which level formal jobs are being created
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki teen saal baad jab sarkaar apana hissaa jamaa karnaa band kar degi tab kya companiyaan in karmchaariyon ko EPFO main inkaa hissaa jamaa karaayengi yaa phir inhen kaam se hataa dengi
 You know that the government has made a rule to freeze the share of companies for three years
 jo hissaa companiyon ko dena he, wo sarkaar de rahi he
 In a way, by giving money to the public, the government is buying data for the public, not giving employment
 agast 2016 main PMRPY launch hui thi
 In the first year there was not much enthusiasm about it
 maatr 425,636 nae labhaarthi EPFO se jude
 This number increased rapidly between September 2017 and September 2018
 kareeb 80 lakh labhaarthi jude hai
 New data shows that the number of new beneficiaries under PMRPY is 74 lakhs
 jabaki is ek saal main EPFO se judane waalon kii sankhya kareeb 80 lakh hi he
 As of October 2018 the number of institutions registered under PMRPY is 1,27,122
 74 lakh nae labhaarthi jude hai
 So on an average, 62 employees are added to an institute
 anual survey of industry (ASI) ke aankadon main jo ausat karmchaariyon kii sankhya nikalati he wo PMRPY main panjikrut sansthaanon main kaam karne vaale logon ke baraabar hi he
 You will not see such an investigation in Hindi newspapers
 behatar he aap bhi is rapat ko dekhen or isaki kamiyon yaa khoobiyon par vichaar vimarsh karen
 i have been explaining this to an audience friend for several days
 ham log har vishay ko nahin samaj sakate hai magar jo unhone likhaa he or mujhe bataaya he main aapke saamne rakh rahaa hum
 He gave an example that in Madhya Pradesh there is a rule that the same contractor who has registered 20 people in EPFO will participate in the government tender
 isse hua yah ki thekedaar tender lene ke liye dost rishtedaaron ko karmchaaree kii jagah dikhaane lage
 Submitted their one month's salary
 EPFO kaa niyam he ki ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa karne ke baad uskaa khaataa 36 maheene tak sakriy rahata he
 Even if you don't collect anything after that
 isse aankade to bad gaye lekin rojgaar nahin badha
 There are an average of 300 types of contractors in a district
 aankadon main is tarah 6000 rojgaar paidaa ho gaya lekin asal main kitna hua, is par andeh he
 Many times the institutes pay 15 days salary and stop giving work, but their registration remains in EPFO
 data main aapako dikhegaa ki ek ko rojgaar mila he or vyavastha aupchaarik ho rahi he magar yah aupchaarik kahaan hui
 The wage was 20 days and the figure increased by one employment
 ham patrakaron ko yah bhi dekhnaa chahie aise kitne santhaan hai jo 1 yaa 2 karmchaariyon kii vruddhi ke kaaran EPFO ke daayre main aae, tab vaastavik vruddhi 1 he yaa 20
 You know that there are more than 20 employees who have to register with EPFO
 19 karmchaaree hai tab aapane panjikaran nahin karaayaa
 But you had to do a new one
 khate main yah 20 rojgaar dikhegaa lekin vaastaviktaa to yahi he ki 19 to pehle se hi kaam kar rahe the
 Every institute has to deposit its share of employees every month
 ise ECR REMITTENCE kehete hai
 There was a kind of receipt
 lekin jab aap IWU

 When you click IN / CAIU / defweblist, you will see the number of institutes that have not given the latest information
 desh bhar ke bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ke 120 karyaalay hai
 More than 100 offices have not given the latest information about the organizations falling in their jurisdiction
 ye to haal he jabaki aisa karnaa anivaary he
 So you will not be able to check if a company had 20 people in the month of October, then in November there are only 20 or less
 to aapako pataa hi nahin chalegaa ki kitna rojgaar paidaa hua
 There are many companies that collect data for a single month
 tippaniyan i am including their conversation in this post so that if any of you are knowledgeable about this subject or have the ability, then go to the website and check

 bijness standard main 26 november ke rose ishan bakshi kii report karmchaaree bhavishyanidhi fund (EPFO) ke aankadon ko lekar he
 Based on the number of employees joining it, it is being claimed that people are getting jobs
 data se pataa chalata he ki yah sankhya isliye badi hui dikh rahi he ki pradhanmantri rojgaar protsaahan yojana (PMRPY) ke kaaran company ko sarkaar se anudaan miltaa he
 People who were already employed for this benefit are mostly connected
 isse pataa nahin chalata he ki nai naukariyaan badi hai yaa pehle se kaam kar rahe log hi yojana kaa laabh lene ke liye jude hai
 Ishaan has written that most people with salary below 15000 get the benefit of PMRPY
 isse bhi pataa chalata he ki kis level kii aupchaarik naukariyon kaa srijan ho rahaa he
 It will also have to be seen that after three years, when the government stops depositing its share, then will the companies deposit these part of these employees in the EPFO or remove them from work
 aap jaanate hai ki sarkaar ne teen saal tak companiyon ke hisse ko jamaa karne kaa niyam banaaya he
 The government is giving the share that has to be given to the companies
 ek tarah se sarkaar janata kaa paisa dekar, janata ke liye aankade kharid rahi he, rojgaar nahin de rahi he
 PMRPY was launched in August 2016
 pehle saal main ise lekar khaasaa utsaah nahin tha
 Only 425,636 new beneficiaries joined EPFO
 sitambar 2017 se sitambar 2018 ke bich yah sankhya tezi se badi he
 About 80 lakh beneficiaries are connected
 nae data se pataa chalata he ki PMRPY ke tahat nae labhaarthi kii sankhya 74 lakh he
 While the number of people joining EPFO in this one year is only 8 million
 oktober 2018 tak PMRPY ke tahat panjikrut sansthaanon kii sankhya he 1,27,122 he
 74 lakh new beneficiaries have been added
 to ausatan ek santhaan main 62 karmchaaree judate hai
 The average number of employees in the Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data is equivalent to those working in institutions registered with PMRPY

 unhone ek udhaaharan diya ki madhya pradesh main niyam he ki sarkari tender main vahi thekedaar hissaa legaa jisane 20 logon kaa EPFO main panjikaran karaayaa he
 As a result of this, the contractor started showing the relatives of the employee to the friend to take the tender
 unka ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa kar diya
 The EPFO rules that after depositing one month's salary, his account remains active for 36 months
 bhale aap uske baad kuch na jamaa karen
 This increased the figures but did not increase employment
 ek zile main ausatan 300 prakaar ke thekedaar hote hai
 In the figures, 6000 jobs were created in this way, but how much actually happened is doubtful
 kai baar santhaan 15 din kii hi selary dete hai or kaam dena band kar dete hai magar uskaa panjikaran EPFO main rahata he
 In the data you will see that one has got employment and the arrangement is being formalized but where has it been formalized
 mazaduri mili 20 dinon kii or aankadon main ek rojgaar bad gaya
 We journalists should also look at how many such institutions have come under the ambit of EPFO due to increase of 1 or 2 employees, then the actual increase is 1 or 20
 aap jaanate hai ki 20 se adhik karmchaaree hone par EPFO main panjikaran karana padataa he
 You did not register when there are 19 employees
 magar ek nayaa aayaa to aapako karana pad gaya
 This 20 jobs will be seen in the account, but the reality is that 19 were already working

 is aalekh main di gai koi bhi soochna athwa tathy athwa vyakt kiye gaye vichaar NDTV ke nahin hai, tathaa NDTV unke liye kisi bhi prakaar se uttaradaayi nahin he
 As of October 2018 the number of institutions registered under PMRPY is 1,27,122
 74 lakh nae labhaarthi jude hai
 So on an average, 62 employees are added to an institute
 anual survey of industry (ASI) ke aankadon main jo ausat karmchaariyon kii sankhya nikalati he wo PMRPY main panjikrut sansthaanon main kaam karne vaale logon ke baraabar hi he
 You will not see such an investigation in Hindi newspapers
 behatar he aap bhi is rapat ko dekhen or isaki kamiyon yaa khoobiyon par vichaar vimarsh karen
 i have been explaining this to an audience friend for several days
 ham log har vishay ko nahin samaj sakate hai magar jo unhone likhaa he or mujhe bataaya he main aapke saamne rakh rahaa hum
 He gave an example that in Madhya Pradesh there is a rule that the same contractor who has registered 20 people in EPFO will participate in the government tender
 isse hua yah ki thekedaar tender lene ke liye dost rishtedaaron ko karmchaaree kii jagah dikhaane lage
 Submitted their one month's salary
 EPFO kaa niyam he ki ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa karne ke baad uskaa khaataa 36 maheene tak sakriy rahata he
 Even if you don't collect anything after that
 isse aankade to bad gaye lekin rojgaar nahin badha
 There are an average of 300 types of contractors in a district
 aankadon main is tarah 6000 rojgaar paidaa ho gaya lekin asal main kitna hua, is par andeh he
 Many times the institutes pay 15 days salary and stop giving work, but their registration remains in EPFO
 data main aapako dikhegaa ki ek ko rojgaar mila he or vyavastha aupchaarik ho rahi he magar yah aupchaarik kahaan hui
 The wage was 20 days and the figure increased by one employment
 ham patrakaron ko yah bhi dekhnaa chahie aise kitne santhaan hai jo 1 yaa 2 karmchaariyon kii vruddhi ke kaaran EPFO ke daayre main aae, tab vaastavik vruddhi 1 he yaa 20
 You know that there are more than 20 employees who have to register with EPFO
 19 karmchaaree hai tab aapane panjikaran nahin karaayaa
 But you had to do a new one
 khate main yah 20 rojgaar dikhegaa lekin vaastaviktaa to yahi he ki 19 to pehle se hi kaam kar rahe the
 Every institute has to deposit its share of employees every month
 ise ECR REMITTENCE kehete hai
 There was a kind of receipt
 lekin jab aap IWU

 When you click IN / CAIU / defweblist, you will see the number of institutes that have not given the latest information
 desh bhar ke bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ke 120 karyaalay hai
 More than 100 offices have not given the latest information about the organizations falling in their jurisdiction
 ye to haal he jabaki aisa karnaa anivaary he
 So you will not be able to check if a company had 20 people in the month of October, then in November there are only 20 or less
 to aapako pataa hi nahin chalegaa ki kitna rojgaar paidaa hua
 There are many companies that collect data for a single month
 tippaniyan i am including their conversation in this post so that if any of you are knowledgeable about this subject or have the ability, then go to the website and check
 companiyon kii suchi main jaakar dekhe ki kitne log pichley maheene kaam kar rahe the or kitne log is maheene kaam par hai
 Only then will we be able to understand the government's claims properly

 mujhe kai dinon se ek darshak mitra is bare main samajha rahe hai
 We cannot understand every subject, but what they have written and told me, i am placing before you
 unhone ek udhaaharan diya ki madhya pradesh main niyam he ki sarkari tender main vahi thekedaar hissaa legaa jisane 20 logon kaa EPFO main panjikaran karaayaa he
 As a result of this, the contractor started showing the relatives of the employee to the friend to take the tender
 unka ek maheene kaa vetan jamaa kar diya
 The EPFO rules that after depositing one month's salary, his account remains active for 36 months
 bhale aap uske baad kuch na jamaa karen
 This increased the figures but did not increase employment
 ek zile main ausatan 300 prakaar ke thekedaar hote hai
 In the figures, 6000 jobs were created in this way, but how much actually happened is doubtful
 kai baar santhaan 15 din kii hi selary dete hai or kaam dena band kar dete hai magar uskaa panjikaran EPFO main rahata he
 In the data you will see that one has got employment and the arrangement is being formalized but where has it been formalized
 mazaduri mili 20 dinon kii or aankadon main ek rojgaar bad gaya
 We journalists should also look at how many such institutions have come under the ambit of EPFO due to increase of 1 or 2 employees, then the actual increase is 1 or 20
 aap jaanate hai ki 20 se adhik karmchaaree hone par EPFO main panjikaran karana padataa he
 You did not register when there are 19 employees
 magar ek nayaa aayaa to aapako karana pad gaya
 This 20 jobs will be seen in the account, but the reality is that 19 were already working
 har santhaan ko har maheene karmchaariyon kaa hissaa jamaa karana hota he
 This is called ECR REMITTENCE

 salaami ballebaaj ajinkya rahane kii naabad pari or gendbaajon ke kamaal ke pradarshan se rajasthan ne tii-20 lig 6 ke behad ekatarfa mukaable main yahaan mumbai par 87 ran kii shahi jeet darj kii
 Rahane scored an unbeaten 68 off 54 balls with the help of eight fours and a six
 unke alaava shen watasan (25 gend par 31), dishanth yagnik (24 gend par 34) or bread haaj (15 gend par naabad 27 ran) ne bhi upyogi yogadan diya
 After winning the toss, Rajasthan came out to bat first and scored 179 runs for three wickets
 ajit chandila ne apane pehle do overon main sachin tendulkar or riki ponting ko out kiya
 Mumbai could not recover from these tremors till the end and its entire team 18
 2 over main 92 ran par dher ho gayi
 Only three of his batsmen reached double digits
 inamen se dinesh karthik (32 gend par 30) or ambati rayudu (29 gend par 27) hi krij par kuch samay bitaa paye
 James Faulkner was the most successful bowler for Rajasthan
 unhone 16 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 Chandila and Stuart Binny took two wickets each
 rajasthan kii yah paanch match main chauthi jeet he or vah aath ank lekar ankatalika main sheersh par pahunch gaya he
 Mumbai have their second defeat in five matches and have slipped to fourth place with six points
 acchhee farm main chal rahe rohit sharma (2) ne powerple samaapt hone ke baad sidvarth trivedi kii pehali gend par pul karne kii koshish kii lekin unki timming sahi nahin thi or vah sidhe watasan ke surakshit haathon main chali gayi
 Stuart Binny uprooted the middle stump of Kieran Pollard (1) and destroyed Mumbai's true expectations
 karthik or rayudu ne bich main chaar over tak wicket girane kaa kram roka lekin is bich ve ran banane ke liye jujhate rahe
 Karthik, who is in good form, is not scoring runs, whose pressure was clearly visible on him
 aakhir main isi dabaav main unhone long aan par kaich oochaal diya
 The Mumbai lower-order batsmen also showed haste to return to the dugout
 uski taraf se karthik or rayudu ke alaava keval mishael janson (11) hi dohare ank me pahunche
 Earlier Rahane shared an unbroken partnership of 62 runs with Watson for the first wicket, 53 runs for the second wicket with Yagnik and 53 runs for the fourth wicket with Haj
 maalinga ne pehle do over main 20 ran diye or ye sabhi ran chaukon se bane
 This Sri Lankan bowler could not leave an impact on both Rahane and Watson
 ponting kaa powerple ke dauraan rishi dhawan or pragyan ojha ko aajmaana bhi kargar sabit nahin hua
 Watson returned to the pavilion soon after the powerplay ended, catching wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik off a ball going out of Pollard's off stump
 unhone apni pari main paanch chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Pollard plundered 16 runs in the next over, including Yagnik's six over midwicket
 yah wicketiper ballebaaj is chakke ke alaava chaar chauke jadne ke baad harbhajan singh kii gend reverse sweep se third main par uthaane kii koshish main tendulkar ko kaich de baitha
 All-rounder Binny could not walk but Haj scored good runs in the death overs
 unhone harbhajan or janson chakke bhi lagaaye
 Johnson scored 19 runs in the last over of the innings, which included three fours from Rahane besides Haj's six
 pakistan ke dhakad gendbaaj or rawalpindi express ke naam se mashhoor shoeb akhtar ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane kaa virodh kiya he
 Akhtar reiterated the same false claim that the Pakistani government often keeps on saying that the Indian government is persecuting the citizens in Kashmir
 akhtar ne soshal media par ek photo share kii, jisamen ek bacchee kii tasviir he, jisaki ek aankh par pattee bandhi he
 It is written on this picture, you define renunciation
 ham aapaki aazaadee ke liye prarthana karte hai or is makasad ke liye jeena shandaar he
 The Pakistani government has always objected to the inclusion of Jammu and Kashmir in India
 anuchhed 370 hataae jane par pakistan tilamila gaya he
 The Imran Khan government has reduced diplomatic relations with India
 bhartiya ucchayukta ajay bisaaria ko pakistan ne nishkasit kar chukaa he
 Apart from this, Samjhauta Express between India and Pakistan has also been canceled
 is kadam ke baad bharat ne dilli se ataari ke bich chalane vaali link express ko radd kar diya
 Apart from this, other bus services including delhi-lahore have been closed between the two countries
 pakistan duniya bhar ke deshon se kashmir mudde par bharat sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf samarthan hasil karne ke liye gidgidaa rahaa he
 But many countries have made it clear that the Indian government's decision on Jammu and Kashmir is its internal issue
 lekin baavjood iske pakistan bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalane se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah has even said that there is no voice in the sticks of Allah
 agar chal gai to narendra modi kaa gurur khaak main mil jayega
 Qureshi said that he would raise the Kashmir issue in the United Nations
 agar ham ekajute nahin hue to itihaas hamen maaf nahin karegaa

 Mamta believes that the move will fade and weaken the saffron party's charge of 'muslim appeasement' against her

 usee tarah jaise 2012 main muslim imaamon or muajjinon ko masik wajife ke bhugtan ke saath hua tha, jis par hycourt ne 2013 main roak laga di thi
 Believing that the courts can quash the worship practices, a TMC minister says, "the move has sent the message that we are secular and we are as Hindu as some parties are claiming to be Hindu

 kaa boj padegaa par rajya ke khajaane par mamata kii durga puja kii revadigoon kii vajah se*** Film Name: Bareilly Ki barfidirector: Ashwini Iyer tiwaristar Cast: Rajkumar Rao, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Pankaj Tripathi, Seema Pahwa Duration: 2 Hour 02 Minutes Certificate: u / a Rating: 3 Ashwini Iyer Tiwari has worked in the background of staraid Agency The first film Nil Batte Sannata was highly appreciated
 haalanki bijness ke hisaab se vah film nahin chal paayi thi
 But Ashwini, along with Bareilly's Barfi, has made a slightly more commercial film this time with a small town story
 dekhte hai ye kitni kamai kar paati he!chote shahar kii bitti kii kahaneeyah kahani bareli ke rahane vaale mishra parivaar kii he jisamen bitti (kriti sinan) apane mata (seemaa pahwa) or pita (pankaj treepathi ) ke saath rahati he
 Bitti's parents want her to get married but Bitti tries to run away from the house due to repeated questions from the boys
 isi bich uske haath bareli kii barfi naamak kitaab lagati he or uske lekhak preetam vidrohi (rajkumaar raav) se use man hi man pyaar ho jaataa he
 In search of Pritam, Bitti meets Chirag Dubey (ayushmann Khurrana), the owner of the printing press
 inhen mail-mulakaaton ke saath kahani aage badhati he or jaisaa ki trailor se hi jaahir hota he- lav triengal banataa he
 Why Kapil Sharma did not shoot KBC with Amitabh Bachchan in Bareilly's Barfi taste of Ashwini Iyer Tiwari is very good and in terms of locations you feel that you are in the same city where this whole story is happening
 camera work badhiya he or shooting kaa tarika bhi acha he
 The dialogues of the film should be specially praised which constantly make the audience laugh
 kai jagah to seen khatm hone ke baad bhi chehre par muskaan bani rahati he
 Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa have done excellent work as parents and as usual this time they also manage to laugh as well as win hearts
 vahinkruti sananbilkul hi alag avatar main lagi hai or is film ke baad unhen alag tarah ke kirdaaron ke liye jarur chunaa jayega
 However, in many places she seems to copy Kangana Runot
 vahiin is tarah kii filmon main ayushmaan khurana pehle bhi jamate rahe hai or is baar bhi unka kaam sahaj he
 But Rajkummar Rao will be called the best
 unke kai saare panch aise hai jo aapako aakhir tak yaad rah jate hai
 Know what movie was Kriti and Sushant's Rabta
 
 
 jahaan tak gaanon kii baat he to film kaa sangeet thik he or khaastaur par sweety tera
 
 
 Song is a hit before the film's release
 twist kamariya kii sunne laayak he
 But Bareilly's Barfi as a Complete Album does not provide much remembered music
 yahaan kharaab hota he testabareli kii barfika cliimax kaaphi predictable he
 It could be tightened further
 duusare hisse main film thodaa bor karti he
 It could be repaired without increasing the length unnecessarily
 box offis ke aankadefilm kaa bajet 20 se 25 karod bataaya ja rahaa he or saath hi toilet ek premakatha pehle se hi kai theatre main chal rahi he
 But due to the distribution of films like Bahubali to Anil Thadani, the film is expected to get a good release
 agar darshakon kii sahi tarif mili to film ke acchhee kamai karne kii puri gunjaaish he

 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain sunil gavaskar aaj apana 68waan janmdin maan rahe hai
 Gavaskar's contribution to the Indian cricket team cannot be forgotten
 vah duniya ke mahanatam ballebaajon se ek rahe hai
 Gavaskar was a defensive batsman and he had courage, combativeness that set him apart from other batsmen in the world
 6 march 1971 main khelaa tha pehla test maichgavaskar ne apana pehla test match duniya kii sabase majboot team westeindies ke khilaaf 1971 main khelaa tha
 He scored 65 runs in that match with the help of any fours and sixes
 yah wo daur tha jab westeindies duniya kii sabase majboot team hua karti thi
 The West Indies had a very creepy fast bowler
 jinke saamne ballebaaji karnaa aasaan nahin hota tha or gavaskar bina helmet ke un gendbaajon ke khilaaf behad yaadgaar paariyaan kheli
 While batting, Gavaskar's timing and shot selection were amazing
 gavaskar ne bhartiya team ko banaaya majbootajab gavaskar ne antarrashtriya cricket main kadam rakhaa tab bhartiya team ko behad kamjor samajha jaataa tha
 But Gavaskar with his combative batting turned the Indian team into one such team
 jise haraa paanaa aasaan nahin hota tha
 Gavaskar's record has been unmatched, 51 in 214 innings of 125 Test matches
 12 kii ausat se 10122 ran banaae

 dilli kii haar ke baad pradhanmantri world cap ke khumaar main duubate nazar aa rahe hai
 Yesterday on Thursday, the Prime Minister, with the name of Team India and all his players, tweeted 16 from his Twitter handle, not only wishing these players to win the cup, but also praised the strong side of each player and tried to cheer them up
 Of
 shuukravaar kii subah unhone chaar or twit kar ye bataaya ki unhone pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz shareef, afghanistan ke raashtrapati ashraf gani, bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina, or srilanka ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati sirisena se baat kar unhen world cap kii shubhakamanaayen deen hai
 Bilateral talks with Pakistan are postponed and in this case, this conversation over the phone has its own importance
 apana kootnithik mahatv bhi kyonki america se jaankaree aati rahi he ki wo bharat ko pakistan ke saath baatcheet ke raste kholane ko lagaataar kah rahaa he
 Well, this time the teams of 5 SAARC countries including India are participating in the World Cup and on this occasion the Prime Minister has also made a big diplomatic announcement
 wo ye ki ve desh ke nae videsh sachiv es jaishankar ko saarc deshon ke bich aapasi samjhauton ke majbooti dene ke liye jald hi ‘saarc yatra’ par bhejenge
 The interest of any Prime Minister in the World Cup is nothing new
 aapasi rishton kii behatari ke liye bharat ke pradhanmantri or pakistan ke pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati (jinaki bhi satta ho) kai baar saath baith kar cricket match dekh chuke hai
 It is named the cricket diplomacy between the two countries
 pradhanmantri kii taraf se world cap jaise bade aayojanon se pehle bhartiya team ko shubhakamanaayen dene kaa chalan pehle bhi rahaa he
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tweeting one after the other about the Cricket World Cup has generated a lot of interest
 kya pradhanmantri modi dilli kii haar ke baad relax hone kii koshish kar rahe hai or cricket world cap unhen ye mauqaa de rahaa he? kya iske zarie wo khabaron main apni khoi hui jagah paanaa chaahate hai, kyonki tivi, akhabaaron main pehle sirf modi chal rahe the or aajkal sirf kejariwal chal rahe hai? kya bharat main opium kii tarah kaa nasha ban chuke cricket par focus kar wo ek baar phir se 'janata kaa aakarshan duusari taraf' le janaa chaahate hai? haar se betkalluf dikhnaa chaah rahe hai? sawaal tamaam hai jinka chota jawaab shaayad haa main he
 Indeed, the massive victory of Arvind Kejriwal drew a big streak in front of Modi's victory
 or ye lakeer sidhi bhi nahin he balki modi kii lakeer ko katati hui khinchi gai he
 Although there is a big difference that Modi won the entire country in the Lok Sabha elections, Kejriwal has just won Delhi
 lekin ye sirf ek raajnneetik ladaai nahin he
 There is also a battle of perception, in which the media is playing an important role
 media kaa ek tabaka jis tarah se modi kii jeet ke baad unke jaygaan main laga rahaa, vaise hi doosraa tabaka kejariwal kii jeet ke baad unke jaygaan main jute gaya he
 Kejriwal is seen climbing
 modi utarate dikh rahe hai
 These ups and downs matter for personalities made up of tv-based popularity
 khaastaur par tab jab unhen ehsaas ho ki vaayadon ke mutabiq zamin par kaamkaaz yaa to nahin ho hua he or agar kuch hua bhi he to logon ko uskaa pratifal nahin mila he
 The public does not mean as much by the efforts of politicians as by the results
 kejariwal kii kaamayaabi 49 dinon kii pichhali sarkaar ke dauraan kii gai koshishon se utani nahin mili jitani ki zamin par wo kuch nateeja de paae, usase mili he
 Such as reduction in electricity, water price and police ban on recovery
 isliye shaayad ab modi ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki bhavishya kii zamin banani or bachaani he, to media kaa kolahal to chahie hi, zamin par kaam bhi karnaa hoga
 Advertisement announcing the cleanliness of "our village, our city, our street, our neighborhood, our school our hospital" has slowed down nowadays
 jhaadu ne kuch or hi buhaar diya he
 Modi has spent so many promises in his speeches that i am starting to get worried thinking about what he will say in Bihar and then Bengal elections
 ek sawaal ye bhi he ki kya ve apana vahi lay-sur or taal usee aatmavishvaas ke saath waapas hasil kar paaenge, jise dilli ke chunavi nateezon ne paddalit kar diya he? ab to shaayad wo apana naam likhaa suut bhi kabhi nahin pahan paaenge, jisane unhen nasibavaala se kam nasibavaala bana diya
 Recall that he was talking of giving 'development' like the results of 20-20 matches before the Lok Sabha elections
 satta main aa gaye to behatar nattejey ke liye match ko 50-50 overon tak khinchne kii maang karne lage
 'give me some time
 congress ko saath saal diya hamen saath maheene to dijie
 
 
 The media did not even give a 100-day honeymoon period
 
 
 aadi aadi’
 By the way, Kejriwal has also come to power with a free hit of promises
 dilli kii geeli zamin par is baar unki koshish pair jamaa kar khilne kii hogi
 This time the team is complete
 ek bhi khilaadi kam yaa chotil nahin
 This time there will be no excuse for slipping
 or modi se kejariwal kaa yahi muqaabala twanti-20 ke do dhurandharon ko ‘test match’ main utarane ko majaboor kar diya he
 Pausing, watching every ball, ticking, if needed, batting both without the extra danger of taking extra risks, going to the backfoot, testing the weak ball and giving proper respect to the good ball
 apana score bada karnaa he
 Kejriwal has just taken the strike after winning the toss
 pehle uttejnaa main dikhte the, par is baar jeet se paidaa hue agreshan ko santulit karne kii koshish karte dikh rahe hai
 This is necessary to perform well
 udhar modi ko abhi kuch dinon tak kshetrarakshan karnaa he
 Fielding has to be done at such a place, where they can be seen running and running on the field and also come on TV
 fielding kii unki har galati ko ection riple kar baar baar dekha jayega
 Especially when Sangh is also watching the match in the stand just next to the pavilion
 modi kii har galati se kejariwal ko extra ran milegaa
 Anyway, Kejriwal has mastered to run one run between two wickets and get a run
 test match main ye majbooti detaa he
 However, Kejriwal also insists on umpires to call him a 'no ball' by hitting a weak ball so that he can score seven runs in one ball
 negative campan ke overthro kaa kejariwal ne kaisaa phayda uthaaya ye to dilli match ke nattejey main ham dekh chuke hai
 They are difficult to dismiss easily
 aise main donon chor se kasi gendbaazi or kaich lapakane kii siddahastata hi modi ke liye batting kaa aglaa mauqaa lekar aayega
 That's why Modi is being attentive
 is haar se agar ve sanbhal gaye hai to ve apni team ke khilaadiyon par anyathaa dabaav banane kii bajaay dressing room main unhen puraa sammaan dete hue unako jaanane samajhane kii koshish karenge
 Like Kiran Bedi, instead of bringing in players from outside, they will try to recognize the talent of their players and give them a chance accordingly
 vaise hi jaise twit kar team india ke har khilaadi kii khubi ko saraahaa he
 When they can identify and write the skills of the players of the Indian cricket team in this detail, then why not use the members of your cabinet and other senior leaders of the party according to their ability
 aisa ho paaegaa yaa nahin ek alag sawaal he
 It is possible that they will fear that such a strong player may come out, who takes away his captaincy
 vaise ye to hota aayaa he or hota rahegaa
 From Kapil Dev to Gavaskar and Azhar, Ganguly, Tendulkar to Dhoni, everyone has to go through the captaincy one day
 yaad sirf ye rah jaataa he ki koun ab tak kaa behtareen captain he
 At the moment, Modi wants the attention of media and public to stay away from the modi-kejriwal match
 khud ko riargenise karne ke liye unhen thodaa time chahie
 That is why they want to bring attention to the Cricket World Cup
 cricket apane aap main ek khel he lekin raajnneetik khilaadi khud ko maidan main phir se jamaane ke liye isse bhi khel ja saktaa he
 In the end, just so, Prime Minister, the country is thankful to you for trying to energize the team
 hamaari bhi shubhakamana saath he ki is baar aap 'chaay par charchaa' karen 'world cap' haath main lekar
 
 
 With Team India
 ham aapke twits par nazar banaae hue hai
 You have not left any other window to peep into your personality
 bindaas anoushka sharma,mohabbat he to mohabbat he
 No team can win more than love
 acha hua jo worldcup khitaab jeetne se ek kadam pehle ham haar gaye
 Someone has rightly said that such a country does not deserve to win the World Cup title or reach the final
 anoushka sharma tum tab tak wo har match dekhne janaa, jab tak ye jaahil desh kisi khel ko apane hasyabodh ke liye mahila se jodna na band kar de
 Unless we citizens of this country stop watching the victory or defeat of a game by associating it with women, then you keep going in the crowd of that audience
 camere bhale hi tumhaara peechha karen
 Facebook, Twitter may be following you like a leech, but you keep going to make this country feel like we are
 cricket ke itihaas main agar satte ke daur ko hataa diya jaae to shaayad hi koi khilaadi yaa team hogi, jo haarane ke liye kheli ho
 As the camera turned into Anushka Sharma in the match, the rounds of chokes started in Facebook, Twitter
 bachi kuchi kasar viraat kohli ke ek ran par out hone ne puri kar di
 Fated to read such idiots on Facebook and Twitter, who called Anushka even a witch
 ye us desh kii kahani he jo vishwa vijeta banane ke liye subah se match se dili taur par apane apane utsaah or junun se judi hui he
 In the Navratras, worshiping the mother and praying for victory did not stop her from enjoying commentary with a woman
 anoushka ham bahut maukaparast hai
 Did not get a chance that the eagle does not come from showing his creativity
 jindagi hanskar jini chahie, is sabak ko hamane kuch zyada hi syriasli le liya he
 But for the sake of this laughter, we are not deterring anyone from cracking down on one's personal life
 maamla like or coment kaa he
 Who does not like 'hahahaha, lol' type comment on his Facebook post
 anoushka sharma yaa viraat kohli hamaari post dekhne thodi aa rahe hai
 Therefore, say whatever you want
 celebrity hai, itnaa to jhelana hi padegaa
 Had to live a private life quietly, then go to the Himalayas
 socity main rahoge to apane coment or hasyabodh kii khatir ham commentnuma rape karte rahenge
 Shame that we think so
 anoushka, aaj jab viraat kohli ke out hone ke baad soshal media par najar gai to tum par kiye bhadde coment se meraa ji uchat gaya
 What kind of thinking has happened, all of us
 vakt badalata gaya, khilaadi or mahilaayein badalati gayi
 Deepika Padukone in 2011 and now Tum
 sab badalata gaya, ban hamaari soch nahin badali
 i myself am also a cricket fan but i do not consider your visit to the stadium responsible for the defeat of my country
 tumhen bhi to ek cricket fain hone ke naate stadium main jane kaa baraabar haq tha or haq he
 Anushka is one more thing
 ham thode kanphyus log hai
 We are pulling you today
 ham vahi the jo film enech-10 main tumhaari acting or mahilaon ke khilaaf ho rahe atyaachaar par stats likhte dikh rahe the
 We grew up and started being called matures
 lekin samaj or apni khushiyon ke liye ham aaj bhi sabase aasaan or kamjor dikh rahe shaks kaa sahaara lenaa nahin bhuule
 But you do not pay attention to all these Anushka
 tum wo karti rahanaa jo tumhaara man kare or ye tab tak jari rakhana jab tak ham sahi galat ke pher se upar na uth jaaen

 " The political deadlock may remain in Maharashtra, but it is being said that Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi is quite happy about the recent developments

 Party sources said that the divided Congress and its ally Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have once again united due to the separation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena in the state
 unke liye yah ghatnakram kisi vardaan se kam nahin he
 Even after getting a majority in the recently held assembly elections, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance has broken down on the claim for the post of Chief Minister
 rajya main congress 20 varsho se congress or rakanpa ke rup main vibhajit rahi he or saath hi baari matbhedon ko jhelane ke baad bhi ek-duusare kaa samay-samay par sahyog karti ai he
 From 1999 to 2014, Congress and NCP activists were busy fighting insurgencies and fighting each other and inadvertently giving political advantage to their rivals
 yahaan tak ki oktober ke ant tak, donon partiyon ke purush or mahila kaaryakarta aapas main raajnneetik bayaanbaji karne main lage hue the
 The parties tarnished each other's image

 This time in the assembly elections held in October, Congress won 44 seats and NCP won 54 seats, while in the year 2014, this figure was 42 and 41 respectively
 donon dal kaa manobal to jarur badha, lekin donon abhi sarkaar banane se bahut dur hai
 The two allied parties may not form the government, but their condition seems to be stronger in the state due to the breakdown of the bjp-shiv Sena alliance and the separation of Shiv Sena from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
