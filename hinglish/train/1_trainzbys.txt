 Many other people of Muslim society also participated in the rise of Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar ne bhi baqayda muslim samaaj ke logon ke saath shaam kii namaaj padhi or uske baad rojedaaron ko khud pani or fal khilaayaa
 However, fewer guests were invited to Nitish's residence this year than many previous years

 a royal meal was also arranged for the guests, which included casserole, chicken, mutton, curd and kheer, after Rojedar broke the fast
 party ke dauraan nitish sabhi mehmaanon kaa khud haal chaal jaan rahe the or dhyaan rakh rahe the

 The mandate of the people of UP is clear and straightforward, but the path to be elected CM is equally confused and crooked
 11 march ko nateezon ke elaan ke baad bijepi kii jholii main 325 siten ain to laga to upi main sarkaar banane kii raah ab koi roda nahin
 But this victory became the biggest reason for the delay in finding a face for the UP government
 tamaam naamon ke bich upi kii kaman sanbhaalane ke liye jaruri yogyataon kii list main manoj sinha kaa naam sabase aage chalaa gaya he
 The factor who took Manoj Sinha's profile ahead of him in the claim of UP CM
 
 
 -manoj sinha pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke bagal kii sansadeey seat gajipur se saansad he or pehle railway rajya mantri or ab swatantra prabhaar ke taur par sanchaar mantralay ko sambhaal rahe hai
 According to Manoj Sinhaperformance, PM has been a dear minister of Modi, who is known for doing his work quietly
 -sinha ko modi or amit shah ke plon main sabase feet mana ja rahaa he or vikaas kii sadak par bhi manoj sinha tej chal sakate he
 Which is necessary for the mission 2019
 -manoj sinha teen baar gajipur se saansad chune gaye hai
 That is, experienced leader of Purvanchal
 -wo bhoomihaar jati se hai, jiskaa upi kii raajnneeti main zyada prabhaav nahin he
 That is, there will be less mutual conflict between the other castes about their election
 -manoj sinha vivaadon se bhi dur rahe hai, or unka kabhi koi vivaadit bayaan nahin aayaa he
 a village minister of Ghazipur in UP is going to become the chief minister's village
 mohanpura ke log duaen kar rahe hai ki manoj sinha kii tajposhi ho jaae
 BHU of Varanasi, from where Manoj Sinha started student politics
 puraane doston ko is bade faisle kaa intjaar he
 Education started from the primary school in the village itself
 -ganit or vigyaan ke vishyon main unki khaas dilchaspee thi
 Further studies were done at the Government City Inter College in the district
 -manoj sinha ke schuli dinon ke saathi umashankar gupta bachapan ke dinon ko yaad karte hue bataate he ki city inter college ke dinon main wo viechpi ke sampark main aae
 Manoj Sinha studied b
tech from BHU after passing the intermediate examination first class
 yahaan raajnneeti main unka dakhal kuch or badha, or 1982 main wo biechayu chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh bhi nirvaachit hue
 After completing studies, he joined politics instead of job
 padhai ke dauraan manoj sinha kaa parivaar varanasi aa gaya tha, isliye varanasi se bhi unka gaharaa lagaav he
 Manoj Sinha, inherited from his father in politics, was a principal in school but was active in social service and politics
 -manoj sinha ne gajipur main rail network ko badhaane ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he
 Now with the candidature of his CM, the expectations of the people of Purvanchal have increased even more

 Narendra Modi's 'tsunami' in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 has given a shocking defeat to the party leaders
 rahul gandhi congress adhyaksh pad se istipha waapas na lene par ade rahane kii sthiti main party ke varisht netaa ek kaaryakari adhyaksh banaae jane ke model ko antim rup de rahe hai
 a meeting is being chaired by senior party leader AK Antony on Wednesday for Rahul's replacement
 isamen sachin payalat, jyotiraditya sindhiya se lekar priyanka gandhi or ashok gahalot sahit kai naam shaamil hai
 Any one of whom can be made Executive Chairman
 darasal congress main nae kaaryakari adhyaksh kii niyukti kar party rahul gandhi ke kandhon se kaam ke kuch boj ko kam kar sakegi
 Apart from this, while the executive president will focus on day-to-day work, Rahul Gandhi can focus on efforts to rejuvenate the party and towards the larger goal
 yahi vajah he ki rahul ke nae uttaradhikari ke naam ko lekar party main lagaataar manthan ho rahaa he
 Sachin Pilot's name as the working president of the Congress is at the forefront, according to those who closely watch Sachin Pilotangress
 payalat mukhar vaktaa or jameen se jude hue netaa ke taur par jane jate hai
 He is 41 years old and can play an important role in connecting the youth to the party
 iske alaava unhen congress ke vafaadaar ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he or party ke diggaj netaa rahe swargeey rajesh payalat ke betaa hai
 Let me tell you that in 2013, after the crushing defeat of Congress in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot was sent to Rajasthan to make the party again
 payalat kii paanch saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja tha ki 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unke chehre ke sahare congress ne satta main vaapasi kii, lekin party alaakaman ne mukhyamantri pad kaa taj ashok gahalot ke sir sajaa diya or sachin payalat ko dipti siem banaaya gaya
 Sachin Pilot is considered close to Rahul
 aise main unki congress kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par niyukti hoti he to vah party ke kayakalp main ahm role adaa kar sakate hai
 Ashok Gehlot: The name of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is also in the race for executive chairman
 rahul gandhi ke liye gahalot utana hi vishwaasapaatr hai jitna sonia gandhi ke liye ahamed patel rahe hai
 Gehlot has acceptance in Congress
 captain amarinder singh, kamalnath or ashok chavaan jaise kshetreey kshatrapon ke saath unka jabardast talmail he
 Gehlot is seen as a hardcore outfit man
 ek mukhyamantri or saansad hone ke alaava, gahalot ne kai padon par kaary kiya he, jisamen pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh or akhil bhartiya congress ke mahasachiv se lekar sanghathan mahasachiv main apana yogadan diya he
 Gehlot was in-charge in the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections, where the Congress chewed Nako Chana to win the BJP
 iske alaava pichley saal karnataka main congress-jedies sarkaar banavaane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Jyotiraditya Scindia is also the name of Jyotiraditya Scindia Kam, who is considered close to Rahul Gandhi as the Executive President of Congress
 sindhiya kaa bahut bada raajnneetik kad nahin he, aise main gandhi-nehru parivaar ke liye upyukt or feet baith sakate hai
 But given the way he has performed in the Lok Sabha elections, it may be difficult for him
 sindhiya upi ke prabharee the, jahaan party ne kaaphi kharaab pradarshan kiya or khud bhi guna seat par haar gaye hai
 Even more important is that in Madhya Pradesh, Congress is considered a center of factionalism
 kamalnath, digvijay singh or jyotiraditya sindhiya main se koi hai kaman ke kareeb jaataa dikhegaa to doosraa gut uski raah main roda atakaayegaa
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadrakas As the Executive President, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is named in the race, the name is the perfect choice for the gandhi-nehru family
 aise main congress ke netaa duusare gandhi ke haathon main kaman die jane kaa swaagat kar sakate hai
 Priyanka Gandhi has a lot to offer
 vah yuva hai or kaaryakartaaon se sidhe judati hai or sabase acchhee baat yah he ki hajir javaabi hai lekin loksabhaa chunaav main koi khaas prabhaav nahin dikhaa saki hai
 Priyanka has been active mostly in the constituencies of her mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi
 aise main sawaal yah he ki kya vah ek purnakalik rajaneta banane kii icchhuk hongi? priyanka gandhi kii raah main duusari baadha yah he ki unke pati robert wadra ke khilaaf aarthik aparaadh ke maamle chal rahe hai
 BJP has surrounded the Gandhi family on the pretext of Vadra regarding all these allegations
 aise main kya priyanka gandhi congress kii kaman sanbhaalengi
 Apart from this, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is against the appointment of Priyanka
 congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par in chaar naamon ke alaava bhi kai naam hai
 These include Jairam Ramesh, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Digvijay Singh
 aise party ek kaaryakari adhyaksh kaa chunaav karne kaa faisla karti he to kise chunaa jayega? yah dekha janaa dilachasp hoga

 West Bengal Governor MK Narayanan has strongly condemned the incident of Dhakamukki and misconduct in the capital Delhi on Tuesday along with Mamata Banerjee and her finance minister Amit Mitra
 rajyapal ne ek press relies jari kar kaha, "rashtriya rajdhani main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or duusare mantriyon par hua afsosna or purvaniyojit hamalaa behad durbhagyapurna he or bharat ke loktantric mulyon par ek dhabba he
 This sentence should be condemned in sharp words
 jo hamale ke liye zimmedaar hai or jin logon ne unhen uksaaya, ve ek loktantric chaukhate ke bheetar kaam karne kaa haq kho chuke hai
 This kind of attack on the democratically elected Chief Minister, Finance Minister and his ministers is unique in the modern history of India and is so serious that the cpm's Politburo should apologize on this
 is bich, main trinmul ke kaaryakartaaon or pashchim bengal ke sabhi logon se aagrah karata hum ki ve shanti banaae rakhen or bhaawanaaon main na bahen
 " idhar, sipiem ne bhi mamata or mitra par hamale kii ninda kii he
 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury has said that the party will investigate the incident, but has also condemned the attacks on the offices of left parties across the state by Trinamool Congress workers
 ullekhneey he ki esefai ke ek kaaryakarta sudipto gupta kii maut ko lekar vampanthi dalon ne dilli main mangalvaar ko pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 Meanwhile, the protesters also scrambled with state finance minister Amit Mitra
 hathapayee ke dauraan unke kapade fat gaye
 The comments vam sanghathanon ke pradarshnakariyon kaa ek samooh ayog ke karyaalay ke baahar trinmul congress pramukh kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 When the Chief Minister reached Mitra with the Deputy Chairman of the Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia at four o'clock, the protesters raised slogans against him
 mamata ko police ne salaah di thi ki vah apni car se baahar nahin nikalen or andar chali jaaen, lekin mukhyamantri ne naare laga rahe evam takhtiyaan laharaa rahe pradarshnakariyon ke bich se bhawan ke andar janaa pasand kiya
 SFI and CPI-M members shouted slogans like 'mamta Banerjee hi-hi, Trinamool Congress hi-hi, Killer Mamta Sharm Karo'
 kshubdh mukhyamantri yah kehete hue bhawan ke andar pravesh kar gayi ki yah asabhy vyavhaar he
 He said, you know why they are performing
 mere saath 10 lakh log hai
 i can bring them to Delhi
 ve pashchim bengal kaa vikaas nahin chaahate

 mamata ne buudhvaar ko pi chidambaram ke saath prastaavit apni mulaakaat bhi radd kar di or kolkata lautne kaa faisla kiya

" is vaakye kii tikhe se tikhe shabdon main ninda kii jaani chahie
 Those responsible for the attack and those who instigated them have lost their right to work within a democratic frameworks
 loktantric dhang se chuni hui mukhyamantri, vittamantri or unke mantriyon par hua is tarah kaa hamalaa bharat ke aadhunik itihaas main apurv he or itnaa gambhir he ki is par sipiem ke paulitte beuro ko aam maafee maangani chahie
 In the meantime, i urge the Trinamool activists and all the people of West Bengal to maintain peace and not get carried away by emotions
 " Here, the CPM has also condemned the attack on Mamta and Mitra
 sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne kaha he ki party is ghatana kii jaanch karegi, lekin unhone trinmul congress ke kaaryakartaaon dwaara rajya bhar main left partiyon ke daftaron par hamalon kii bhi ninda kii he
 It is noteworthy that the Left parties held a protest against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday in Delhi over the death of Sudipto Gupta, an activist of SFI
 isi dauraan, pradarshnakariyon ne rajya ke vittamantri amit mitra se hathapayee bhi kii
 His clothes ripped off during the scuffle

 lekin donon dalon ke netaaon kaa kahana hai ki ek darunda seat jahaan bijepi ke sthaneey netaa baagi ummidavaar ke rup main chunaav maidan main hai or jiske kaaran trikoniya muqaabala he
 If we look at the results of the last Lok Sabha election on all the remaining seats, then certainly the LJP has a heavy weight in one Lok Sabha seat Samastipur, then the candidates of Janata Dal United in Nathnagar, Belhar and Simri Bakhtiarpur
 baat karen kishanganj seat kii to yah congress party kaa garh rahaa he or yahaan par filhal koi ulatpher kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Daronda seat and where Janata Dal United had a lead of 26987 votes and then candidate Kavita Singh, whose husband Ajay Singh is currently the party's candidate in the Vidhan Sabha, is said to have cast half a dozen people in the Lok Sabha
 During the election, he promised to make a candidate for the Legislative Assembly elections in exchange for help, but at the same time, he himself came to the ground with a ticket
 puure ilaake main unke badhate raajnneetik prabhutaa ko bhi kam karne ke liye bhi ek muhim chali hui he
 After this, in Belhar seat where Janata Dal United had a lead of 29722 votes in the Lok Sabha elections and there was a triangular fight at that time, but this time the party's candidate is the brother of current MP Giridhari Yadav
 janata dal united kaa maananaa he ki is seat par jeet darj karnaa bahut mushkil nahin he
 As far as the Lok Sabha elections in both Simri Bakhtiyarpur and Nathanagar, Janata Dal United candidates were ahead with 41209 and 36462 votes
 vaise hi kishanganj sitaur trikoniya sangharsh ke baad congress party ko loksabhaa chunaav main aath hazaar voton kii badhat hasil kii thi jiske kaaran bhi is baar BJP ke ummidavaar ke maidan main rahane ke baavjood mana ja rahaa he ki congress party ko yahaan koi bahut dikkat nahin honi chahie
 And perhaps this is the reason that while Nitish Kumar did not campaign more than one public meeting, apart from his public meeting BJP leader Damkham did a road show in addition to the public meeting to celebrate the coalition religion
 vahiin tejasvi yadav kaa puraa dhyaan un chaar vidhaan sabha ilaaqon main rahaa jahaan unke party ke pratyaashee the
 Though after a lot of criticism, he finally held a meeting in favor of the Congress candidate in Samastipur Lok Sabha seat, but after the election results this time, if the Congress avoids the party then it is no surprise

 Imran, who was the captain of the team during Pakistan's 1992 World Cup win, said in the promotional program, "we do not know who is the captain of Pakistan yet three weeks before the World Cup

 haal hi main hui padam puraskaron kii ghoshnaa main ek naam odisha ke daitri nayak kaa bhi he, jinhen padmashri dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 Let us tell that Daitri Nayak is the person who built a canal in a mountainous plateau area to bring water to his village
 kisaan nayak ne apni is mehnat se gaanv ke kai or kisaanon kii mushkil dur kar di thi
 The 70-year-old doctor had taken nearly 3 years to construct this canal and in these three years he dug a canal long canal on his own
 bataa den ki pehle kendujhar jile ke bansapal, telkoi or harichandpur block ke logon ko pichley kaaphi samay se pani ke abhaav main jeena padataa tha or kheti par bhi asar pad rahaa tha
 However, people are getting plenty of water after their hard work
 nayak ne yah kaam shuru karne se pehle pani laane kii thaan lee thi or unhone apana vachan puraa karke hi dam liya
 His family helped him in this work and the canal was built by breaking the stones
 haalanki daitri nayak ke bare main pataa chalane par prashasan ne sud lee or aavashyak madad kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 The story of Daitri Nayak is similar to that of Dashrath Manjhi of Bihar
 bataa den ki dasharath maanjhi ne 20 saal se zyada samay tak ek pahaad katkar apane gaanv ke liye rasta banaaya tha
 It is said that the people of Dashrath Manjhi's village also had a lot of difficulty due to the mountain, so they broke that mountain and made way

 The defense magazine Indian Defense Review has released part of the report on its website
 isse pehle report ko australian patrkaar neville maxwell ne jari kiya tha
 The Henderson Brooks report is an analysis by the Indian Army officers of the 1962 war, Lieutenant General Henderson Brooks and Brigadier PS Bhagat, who belonged to the Indian Military Academy at the time
 report main tatkaaleen raajnneetik or sainya dhaanche kii aalochana kii gai he
 This report was categorized as a top secret document and the government has been rejecting the demand till the last year
 maxwell ne yuddh kii vyapak reporting kii thi or unhone henderson brooks report ke kuch hisse ko apni website par jari kiya tha
 The Ministry of Defense avoided reacting to any published report

 Therefore it would not be appropriate to comment on the content put on the web by Neville Maxwell
 ' The Henderson report criticized the then government, military, and intelligence agencies for basing their belief that the Chinese would not promote the war, while military should have thought it 'the exact opposite'
 report main kaha gaya he ki aage badhane kii niti main china ke daawey vaale kshetron main sainya chowkiyaan banane tathaa aakraamak gasht shuru karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 This increased the possibility of conflict

 BJP and Congress clashed with each other over the contents of the report
 mukhya vipakshi party bhaajapa ne congress par yah kehete hue hamalaa kiya ki usne tab bhi suraksha ke saath samjhauta kiya or vah abhi bhi vahi kar rahi he
 At the same time, the Congress retaliated and accused the BJP of doing 'cheap politics' on this issue before the Lok Sabha elections

 Ambika Singh says, 'when we entered Yasmin's house, he tried to run away

 In the raid on Yasmin's house, the police received one and a half kg of heroin, Rs 85,000 cash and nine mobiles
 'chhapemari main praapt heroin kii keemat antarrashtriya bazaar main sava karod rupee aanki gai he
 Yasmin has been associated with her husband Abdul Hasan alias Tony for the last decade and a half in this illegal business
 vah jaitpura thane kaa historishiter he
 Of the 16 cases filed against him, 10 belong to the NDPS Act
 pichley 16 varshon main vah 10 baar jail ja chukaa he, lekin har baar chhot jaataa he
 Tony managed to escape this time too, but confident Faramati Yadav says, "soon we will arrest Tony as well

 'abdul Hasan used to run this business alone before
 lekin jab khub paisa aane laga to usne apni patni ko bhi is dhandhe main laga diya
 Not only this, he also involved his brother-in-law's daughter in this illegal business
 ambika singh kahati hai, 'jab ham log yasmin ke ghar main ghuse to andar kaa najaara dekhakar bilkul hairaan rah gaye
 There was no such thing of comfort, which was not in that house
 itnaa paisa or aishoaaraam to ham log apni puri naukari ke dauraan bhi ikattha nahin kar sakate, jitna yasmin ke yahaan maujuud tha

 bakaul mishra, 'barabanki se laakar heroin puure shahar main bheji jaati he
 The goods reach the ghats on the banks of the Ganges

 The gang's wires are also connected to Bhabua and Sasaram in Bihar

 However, the four accused have been sent to jail, but the real kingpin Tony is still roaming free

 sonia gandhi aspataal se discharge hokar ghar to aa gayi hai, lekin agle kuch hafton tak doctoron ne aaraam kii salaah di he
 So, on the day of August 15, the question came, who will hoist the flag at the party headquarters this time? The answer was simple - Rahul Gandhi
 phir bhi sawaal uthaa kyonki 1998 main party adhyaksh banane ke baad mahaj ek baar hi aisa hua tha, jab saal 2011soniyapani beemaari ke chalate videsh main thim or ummid lagaai gai ki sonia kii jagah rahul jhanda fahraayenge
 Rahul also came to the Congress headquarters wearing a Gandhi cap, but on this occasion he requested the treasurer and senior leader Motilal Vora to hoist the flag and Vora hoisted the flag honoring Rahul's words
 tab iske do myne nikaale gaye
 The first is that Rahul is the party general secretary, so technically, in terms of rank, there is more general secretary in the party, in which the senior most Motilal Vora was given the responsibility
 doosraa ye ki congress kaa sanchaalan sonia or unki team ke haathon main hi he, abhi timrahulsirf di gai jimmedaari tak hi simit he or turant team rahul tech over nahin karne ja rahi he, ye sandesh bhi diya janaa tha
 But this time the party officially announced that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi will hoist the flag at Congress headquarters on 15 August 2016
 aakhir ab wo aadhikarik taur par party ke upaadhyaksh hai yani party main number do
 By the way, now everyone also knows that only the date is announced or else the coronation of Rahul Khan has been decided
 rahul ke jhanda fahraane ke siyaasi mynesiasi halkon main tab motilal vora or ab rahul ke jhanda fahraane ke myne nikaale ja rahe hai
 The message is simple that in the coming days, the command of the Congress is to be handed over to Rahul
 sonia gandhi apni jimmedaariyon kaa transfar teji se raahal ko kar rahi hai
 On the other hand, according to sources, Rahul himself has agreed to take command of the party with the coordination between old and new leaders
 isiilie is baar sonia kii beemaari ke chalatecongressmukhyalay main jhanda fahraane kii jimmedaari khud rahul nibhaayenge
 Many of the Congress programs postponed due to Sonia's illness, the party wanted to limit the use of Sonia, but she was ready to capitalize on Sonia's campaign on important occasions and places
 kaashi ke baad elahabaad main sonia kaa kaarykram agast maheene main hi ban rahaa tha, lekin philhal ab is kaarykram ko taal diya gaya he
 Also, future programs of Sonia Gandhi have also been put on hold
 jab tak sonia puri tarah swasth nahin ho jaatin, tab wo kisi saarvajanik kaarykram main hissaa nahin lengi
 Like Rajiv Gandhi on his birthday on August 20, the chances of his participation in the program of Sadbhavna award are not being mentioned
 sonia kii jagah rahul ke kaarykram karaane kii taiyaariupi or punjab chunaav ke maddenjar ab sonia gandhi kii jagah rahul gandhi ke kaarykram nae sire se taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 For instance, in Allahabad, the program of Rahul Gandhi is going to be prepared by extending the Congress program a little further
 mahasachivon se mulaakaat kar rahul hi karenge faislerajya sanghathanon se jude maamle hon yaa phir rashtriya raajnneeti se jude faisle, sonia ke thik hone tak antim faisla rahul kaa hi hoga
 By the way, Rahul was still making most of the important decisions of the party, on which Sonia used to stamp
 lekin us surat main kuch ek faisle sonia ke darbar main rivyuu ho jaaya karte the yaa kah sakate hai ki sonia vito power kaa istemaal kar liya karti thim
 But now only Rahul will decide and he will be the last
 sonia ke thik hone par hi rahul sanbhaalenge party kii kamanasootron ke mutabik, party ne tay kiya tha ki sansad kaa monsoon satr khatm hone ke baad se sahi vakt dekhakar rahul kii tajposhi kar di jaaegi
 But now Team Rahul only says that only a decision will be made in this regard only after Sonia's health is fine
 sonia ke biimaar rahete rahul kaa party kii kaman sanbhaalanaa thik nahin rahegaa or naa hi iske liye khud rahul raji honge
 Priyanka's role also increased, so Priyanka is constantly active behind the scenes within the party
 apni maa sonia ke loksabhaa kshetra raibareli ke logon kaa saptahik janata darbar bhi unheen ke yahaan lagata he

 The challenge presented in front of the court's ranks today has been embraced by the emperors themselves, and the situation is that all attempts to draw a big line parallel to the line seem to be inadequate
 desh ke pradhansevak narendra modi ke liye varsh 2019 ek behad chunauteepurn saal he
 This challenge seems to be more difficult than the time of Modi's rise in 2013
 2013 main modi ne sitambar ke maheene main bhaajapa kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa cheharaa banane ke baad prachaar ke rath khol die the
 a magician who showed a 3D film of dreams and hopes stood before a 10-year-old government surrounded by allegations of corruption

 There were promises
 jo nahin hua he, use kar dikhaane kaa sankalp tha
 There was a mirror in which everything looked good on sight
 log is aaine kogujrat modelkahate hai
 People believed this magical mirror showing good images and after seeing their images as true, they were fascinated by their changed picture
 naaraa uchhla- achche din aane vaale hai
 Losing faith from one side of the river of politics, the public liked the decoration on the other side
 modi kaa prachaar dhire-dhire lahar banataa ja rahaa tha or us lahar ke saamne raajnneeti ke tamaam kunbe kamazor padate chale gaye
 With the same propaganda and management, the Modi wave saw the existence of a non-congress government with a majority for the first time since independence and Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country
 dhwast hota tilismalekin 2019 kii pehali subah tak saadhe chaar saal se zyaada arsa biit chukaa he

 Instead of living up to the criteria of Gujarati Mirror, it is becoming blurred with grime and stains

 The work of recognizing and expressing the image of India at the global level is not being done by other countries but India itself
 pradhanmantri ke paas anginat videsh yatraaon kii suchi he, lekin uske mukaable uplabdhiyaan bahut kam
 Terrorist attacks on India from Pakistan have neither been mitigated by Modi's speeches nor by his tea drinking and hugging

 Diesel prices have broken the back of farmers

 Crop insurance promises for farmers crying for fertilizer and seeds have proved superficial and cheap

 Nakel's promises on black money and corruption seem to be all round
 modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa kalpatr risati hui gaagar banakar rah gaya he
 It is not without reason that the people who were not ready to listen to a word against the first Prime Minister have now started speaking bitter words of criticism
 rajasthan, punjab, telugana, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, bihar or dilli main janata pehle hi modi model ko khaarij kar chuki he
 The dream of Congress-mukt Bharat has already collapsed before reaching its ultimate goal
 modi banaam modihalanki, modi kaa jaadu abhi puri tarah se chur ho gaya he, aisa nahin he
 In face-based politics, Modi is still overshadowing the faces of his party and other parties
 lekin loktantr keval ek chehre se chalane vaali gaadi he nahin
 Decentralization and participation from power to power is the greatest beauty and strength of democracy and without it any magic fades
 vipakshi or kshetreey dalon se to modi ko kadaa muqabla karnaa hi he, lekin 2019 main usase bhi badi chunauti he 2014 ke modi ke samaanaantar ek badi lakeer khinch paanaa
 It does not seem to be happening right now
 modi kaa muqabla khud modi se he
 At the moment there is no chance of a wave like 2014 and the magic of unseen dreams is going to work
 har baat par, har vaade par 2019 main logon ke saamne khadey modi kii tulana 2014 ke modi se hogi
 Modi with good dreams will stand in front of rocky truths
 log 2019 ke modi kii tulana baar-baar 2014 ke modi se karenge
 Modi had dreams to show last time
 is baar modi ke paas paanch saal ke kaarykaal kaa lekhajokha hoga
 And functioning proves not by telling, but by obeying
 janata agar in paanch saalon ko sapanom se zyaada sajila maanegi, tabhi modi ek or lahar, ek or vaapasi kaa khwab dekh sakenge
 Of course, 2019 is going to be the toughest year for Modi
 or is mukaable main modi ke saamne vipaksh to he hi, khud 2014 kaa modi bhi khadaa he
 It is to be seen whether Modi will be able to draw a big line or his pen will dry before he can create history

 Leena Maria, the heroine who made an entry in Hindi films through John Abraham's film through South Indian films, turned out to be the biggest trickster of recent times
 agar chennai police kii maane, to leena maaria ne apane boyfrand ke saath milakar kai sau karod kii thagi kii he
 Leena did all this cheating only to fulfill her expensive hobby

 Just think, when sitting in these cars ranging from one to four crores, she would leave the world to lime, then who would not have caught herself in the trap of her eye and beauty? The policemen themselves are not ready to give her less title than 'lady Natwarlal', given the story of Leena Maria, the heroine who is going to kill Bollywood entry from Bollywood movies of South
 dilli or chennai police ke joint oparation ke tahat giraftaar kii gai leena par iljaam he ki wo pichley ek saal main hi desh bhar main logon ko kai sau karod kaa chuunaa laga chuki he, jinamein kuch rashtrica bank tak shaamil hai
 She used to do all this work together with her lover
 jaanate hai kyon? taaki wo apane mahange or ayyash shauk ko puri kar sake
 The daughter of a minor engineer working in Dubai has a lot of hobbies, which has been on modeling and film screen for only two years
 boyfrand pehle se thagi ke dhandhe main tha
 The trickster heroine came along, and the business went on
 donon milakar laal batti kii kaaron yaa phir mahangi kaaron main aam bijnesaman se lekar sarkari bank ke senior afasaron se milte
 Maria was used as a baby doll in these meetings
 boyfrand deal karata or heroin apni dilkash adaaon se un deal ko anjaam tak le jane main madad karti
 After completing her studies from Dubai in 2011, Maria arrived in Mumbai to try her luck in the modeling world
 vahiin uski mulaakaat shekhar reddy urf balaji se hui
 Moving around in expensive vehicles, wearing expensive clothes and five star living soon brought Maria closer to Balaji
 donon main pyaar ho gaya
 Balaji then got Maria some modeling assignments and then took her to Chennai
 chennai main maaria ko balaji kii madad se kai filmon main heroin kaa lead role mila or wo dakhte hi dekhte tollywood main mashhoor ho gai
 While spending time together, Maria came to know that the means of Balaji's earnings were fraud
 farrotedaar angreji bolne vaala balaji khud ko iees afasar bataakar nae-nae project paas karaane ko lekar aam bijnesaman se paise letaa yaa phir bank se lone
 After that, he would slip the money as soon as he got his hands
 baad main is kaam ke liye usne maaria ko apana partner bana liya
 It is said that Balaji and Maria looted hundreds of people in Chennai in a similar manner
 iees afasar ke alaava balaji khud ko kabhi tamilnadu ke purv mukhyamantri karunanidhi kaa pota bataata tha, to kabhi purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda ke bete nikhil gauda kaa jigari dost
 In the name of getting people to do work, he would take huge amount of money from them
 chennai police ke mutabik balaji or maaria ke khilaaf chennai main alag-alag hisso main dhokhaadhadi ke sau se zyada maamle darj hai
 But the exploits of both of them came to the headlines when Balaji took a loan of 19 crore 75 lakhs from Chennai's Canara Bank with the help of Maria and then disappeared as soon as the loan amount was received
 balaji ne bank main khud ko iees afasar bataaya or ek project ke naam par ye lone liya tha
 Later on the complaint of the bank, the Chennai police started searching for both
 police se bachane ke liye maaria balaji ke saath isi maheene chennai se bhagkar dilli aa gai or farmahouse kiraye par le kar rahane lagi
 At present, the police is engaged in investigation that during their stay in Delhi, who did these people defraud and where did the nine expensive cars come from? Since no case has been filed against Mariya in Delhi yet, Chennai Crime Branch has taken Leena Maria to Chennai on transit remand after the arrest of Lina Maria, while the Delhi Police is still on the lookout for Balaji

 " bharat or australia ke bich esasiji par trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke dauraan sachin tendulkar ke ran out hone ko lekar vivaad paidaa ho gaya
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni strongly criticized Australian fast bowler Brett Lee for standing in the way of this star batsman
 tippaniyan It was the last ball of the seventh over of the Indian innings on SCG, which was famous for the 'monkeygate scandal' four years ago
 yah over lee ne kiya tha
 Gautam Gambhir sounded for a run and Tendulkar also ran but David Warner dismissed him
 lee tab unki raah main aa gaye the
 Tendulkar was very disappointed to be dismissed in this manner
 saath jaahir tha ki lee ne jis tarah se unka rasta roka tha usase vah khush nahin the lekin ampire simon tuffel (tab squaire leg par khadey) or billy boden ne kuch der charchaa karne ke baad ballebaaj ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya
 Dhoni hit Lee at the press conference for the match
 dhoni ne kaha ki australian tej gendbaaj ko tendulkar ke raste main aane kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 He said, 'I don't believe you can justify that Lee Point was going towards the fielders
 main nahin maanata ki use tab vahaan jane or tendulkar ke aage khadey hone kii jarurat thi
 This meant that Tendulkar had to go a long way
 us ran out par yah meraa akalan he
 ' chaar saal pehle ‘mankigate cond’ ke liye mashhoor rahe esasiji par bhartiya pari ke saatven over kii vah aakhri gend thi
 It was over by Lee
 gautam gambhir ne ek ran ke liye aawaaj lagaai or tendulkar bhi daud pade lekin david warner ne unhen ran out kar diya
 Lee then came in his way
 tendulkar is tarah se out hone se kaaphi niraash the
 It was also evident that Lee was not happy with the way his road was blocked, but umpires Simon Tuffel (then standing at square leg) and Billy Boden ruled against the batsman after some discussion
 dhoni ne match ke samvaadadaata sammelan main lee ko aade haathon liya
 Dhoni said that there was no need for the Australian fast bowler to get in the way of Tendulkar
 unhone kaha, ‘main nahin maanata ki aap is baat ko sahi qaraar de sakate ho ki lee point kshetrarakshak kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 i do not believe that he then needed to go there and stand in front of Tendulkar
 iskaa matlab tha ki tendulkar ko lanbaa rasta tay karnaa padaa
 This is my assessment on that run out

 portal While there is still uncertainty about whether Kapil Dev has been removed from the bcci's one-time beneficiary list, the former captain said that the Cricket Board officials are the boss and it is their decision
 kapil ne kaha, ve bos hai
 Let them do what they want
 is masale par baat karne kaa kya matlab banataa he
 Kapil, the captain of India's 1983 World Champion team, has not been invited by the BCCI to the four places in the IPL where former cricketers are being honored by giving them checks to serve the Indian cricketer
 kapil ne 131 test or 225 ekadivasiy antarrashtriya match khele or unhen cricket jagat ke sarvakalik mahaan oleroundaron main gina jaataa he
 According to bcci's plan, they should get Rs 1
5 crore

 maine bharat kii taraf se khilne kaa lutf uthaaya or yah mahatvapurn he
 i can do nothing but this
 main nakaaratmak baaten karke sahaj mahasoos nahin karata
 i am a very positive person and i do not talk about negative things
 mana ja rahaa he ki bisisiai ne kapil ko isliye, nazarandaaj kiya kyonki vah indian cricket lig main shaamil the or unhone board kii maafee sweekaar nahin kii thi

 i enjoyed playing for India and this is important
 main iske alaava kuch nahin kar saktaa
 i do not feel comfortable talking negatively
 main behad sakaaratmak insaan hum or main nakaaratmak chizon ke bare main baat nahin karata
 It is believed that the BCCI ignored Kapil because he was involved in the Indian Cricket League and did not accept the Board's apology
 bisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ne jahaan kaha ki kapil kaa naam laabh paane vaale khilaadiyon kii suchi main shaamil he, vahiin kuch anya adhikariyon ne kaha ki unhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya

 There will be deaths, hostages will be made, and the government will get the conditions

 Arvind Kejriwal said that i want to congratulate Mamata Banerjee that she fought against the CBI

 In the survey conducted in 70 seats of Delhi, many of the BJP leaders will be able to win the election this time
 survey ke mutabik is baar chunaav main jagadish mukhi, sahib singh chouhan, mohan singh bist or essiel gupta ke liye jeet mushkil he
 The party is confident of winning only eight seats and it also has a Greater Kailash seat from where Minister Kiran Walia is an MLA
 iske alaava party walia, harun usuf or narendra nath ko bhi haraane kaa sapana dekh rahi he
 In the survey conducted by the party, the seats of Delhi have been kept in three different categories
 pehle category wo jisamen party aaraam se jeet jaaegi, duusari wo jisamen party ranneeti or ummidavaar main badlaav karke hi chunaav jeet sakati he or teesri category main party ko jeet kii koi ummid nahin he
 The party has kept only 8 seats in the a category i
e
 those seats from where the victory is confirmed
 is survey ke mutabik jo siten party pakkaa jeetegi usamen shiksha mantri kiran walia kii greater kailash seat hi shaamil he
 Apart from this, all those seats in this category are those which are already with the BJP
 b category main wo siten shaamil hai, jinpar party ko khaasi mashkkat kerani padegi yani yaa to ummidavaar badalane padenge yaa ranneeti
 There are about 32 to 35 seats in this category
 mjedaar baat ye hai ki is category main bijepi ke ab tak ke garh rahe ilaake shaamil hai
 If the survey fits well then Jagdishmukhi from Janakpuri, Sahib Singh Chauhan from Ghonda, Naresh Gaur from Babarpur and Mohan Singh Bist from Karawal Nagar will have to either cut their tickets or change their strategy considerably
 is category main harun usuf kaa balli maaraan, dow e
 K
 walia kaa lakshmi nagar, kiran walia kaa malviya nagar, narendar nath kaa shahdara or anil kumaar choudhary kaa patapadganj bhi shaamil he
 That is, if the party works hard, then it can take away these seats from the Congress
 teesri category main un siton ko rakhaa he jo jeetna naammumkin he
 There are about 25 seats in this category
 inamen lavali kii gandhi nagar, prahlada singh saahani kii chandani chowk or rajkumaar chouhan kii mongolpuri ke alaava shueb ikwaal kii matia mahal , kanvar karan singh kii model toun , tarvinder marwaah kii jangpura, or amrish gautam kii kondli kaa naam he
 Overall, if this party's survey is to be believed, then the coming election of Delhi will be full of vicissitudes
 dono hi partiyon ke kai dhurandhar mushkil se chunaav jeetenge or kai mantri ghar jaaenge
 BJP will have to cut the ticket of its leaders and it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to form BJP government

 It is being told that the outpost incharge injured by the bullet was out on patrol at that time
 gambhir rup se ghayal SI santosh yadav ko ilaaj ke liye varanasi ke biechayu troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 The injured are posted at Loda police post of Alinagar police station of Daroga Chandauli
 udhar chaowkee incharge par hamalaa kar bhaag rahe teen badmaashon main se do ko graminon kii madad se police ne pakad liya, jabaki teesraa badmaash faraar ho gaya
 In fact Santosh Yadav, in-charge of Loda Police Outpost, went out on a motor cycle patrol late at night
 unke saath duusari motor cycle par do sipaahi bhi the
 While patrolling, Websani was going towards the village
 tabhi chaowkee incharge kii najar barhuli gaanv ke paas ek puliya par baithe teen yuvakon par padi

 Shiv Sena, bjp's partner in the central and state government of Maharashtra, has been consistently giving statements in praise of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 is par bihar sarkaar main bijepi kii saathi jediu kaa kahana he ki shivasena kaa bayaan chaunkaane vaala he
 Shiv sena-bjp are old friends, they are the only party that matches bjp's views
 unhone kaha tha ki balasaheb thakare ke netritv main shivasena kaa janm congress ko haraane ke liye hua tha
 JDU leader KC Tyagi said that the statement actually made by Shiv Sena is of resentment and anger
 kya shivasena aisa maanati he ki congress party kii dharmanirpekshata thik he? kya shivasena congress ke babari masjid ke ravaiya ko maanati hai? aisa nahin he par kahin naa kahin shivasena kii naaraazgi bhaajapa ke prati he isliye vah is tarah kii bayaanbaji kar rahi he
 But the words coming out of the mouth of the oldest friend will also bother the BJP, i believe
 unhone kaha kigujarat, karnataka, himachalke nattejey bhi disha tay karenge
 We have never called Rahul Gandhi a Pappu
 He is a member of a family of the Congress Party who participated in the freedom struggle
 tyaagi bole ki bhale hi unki paripakvata utani naa ho lekin unako under kam aankna uskaa majaak udaana bhi sahi nahin he
 Tyagi said that his party is still the main opposition party of the country, Congress party did not suffer such a bad and terrible defeat even in 1977
 lekin anubhav or spich delivery ke aadhaar par modi ji abhi bhi rahul gandhi se aage he
 Let us tell you that in the Aaj Tak program Mumbai Manthan, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that there is huge crowd in Gujarat to listen to Rahul Gandhi
 janata kisi ko bhi pappu bana sakati he, rahul gandhi ab pappu nahin hai
 What Rahul Gandhi says, what he does
 kisase miltaa he
 People of this country have started taking interest in him
 iskaa matlab he ki rahul gandhi bhi is desh ko leadership de sakate hai
 Sanjay Raut said - BJP government is running with our support, Sanjay Raut said in conversation with Aaj Tak that we have never done politics of two faces
 unhone kaha ki ham dohare chehre nahin karte hai, wo karte hai jo kuch chunaav main kehete hai
 After coming to power, some say, they do politics with mockery
 raut ne kaha ki ye devendra fadanvis nahin bol rahe hai, ye mukhyamantri bol rahe hai
 These are his happy words but he should keep in mind that his government is running with our support
 hamen satta main rahane kaa koi shauk nahin he
 We have never broken an alliance, BJP has broken the alliance
 unhone kaha ki maharashtra main janata ke bhale ke liye ham ek saath hai
 We came together for Hindutva
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle unhone gathbandhan todaa tha
 Now they feel that if they can win the elections alone then they should decide on the alliance
 hamane to hameshaa gathbandhan dharm nibhaayaa he
 Film Name: Tumbadadirector: Rahi Anil Barve, Anand gandhistar Cast: Soham Shah, Ranjini Chakraborty, Deepak Damle, Anita Date, Harish Khanna Duration: 1 hour 53 minutes Certificates: a Rating: 3
 5 starsoham shah ne gulab gang, talwaar or simran jaisi filmon main alag alag role main najar aae hai
 He made his debut in 2012 in Tumbad, a fictional story of a village called 'tumbad' in Maharashtra
 filmako anand el raay ne saport kiya or ab yah relies hone ko taiyaar he
 Let's know how this film is made after all
 
 
 kahani:yah film teen chaptars main banti gai he
 The story begins in 1918 where Vinayak Rao (soham Shah) lives with his mother and brother in village Tumbad in Maharashtra
 lekin vahaan ke baade main ek khajaane ke chupe hone kii baat kahi jaati he
 Whose mother is also looking for him
 lekin kuch aisi baaten hoti hai, jisaki vajah se uski maa, use pune lekar chali jaati he
 After 15 years Vinayak again goes to Tumbad and starts searching for the treasure
 uski shaadi or bachche bhi ho jate hai, lekin khajaane kaa lobh use baar-baar pune se tumbad jane par vivash karata rahata he
 Eventually such an event happens, which is also a big lesson
 ise jaanane ke liye film dekhni padegi
 Know why you should watch the film, although the story of the film is fictional but tremendous
 pehle frem se lekar aakhir tak aapako seat par baandhe rakhti he
 The funny thing is that you do not get time to pay attention to the mobile phone
 kyonki puri tarah se aapako screen par dhyaan dena padataa he ki kahin koi cheez chhot naa jaae
 In the film, there is a very big talk about man's biggest fascination and greed
 jo raahi anil barve ne darshaayi he
 The background score of the film is amazing and the filming style is very good
 ek tarah se film 2di main 3di kaa majaa dilaati he
 In the film Kaisa Hai, the actor has played a very good character in terms of acting, Soham Shah and his hard work is also seen on the screen
 kaaphi mushkil seen hai, lekin unhen bakhubi har kirdaar ne nibhaayaa he
 The locations are amazing and in a way this film is a visual treat
 film kaa tital trek bhi kahani ke sang-sang chalata he
 Weak Links: The weak link of the film is probably its certification, which is 'A'
 yani kii sirf edlt log hi is film kaa dekh paaenge
 Also, there is no big star in the film
 is vajah se bhi darshakon ko theatre tak khinch paanaa bahut hi bada kaam hoga
 Most people still do not know that this film is releasing
 lekin jinhen ek baar bhi isaki khabar milegi, wo jarur apni seat surakshit karenge
 Box Office: The budget of the film is quite low, but with it Jalebi is releasing in production of Govinda's Friday, Kajol's helicopter Eela, Mahesh Bhatt
 screens kii maaramaari ke bich ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki film kaa haal kaisaa hoga
 Do you know what is written by luck? Gauhar Hassan, who secured 137 rank in this year's Civil Services Examination, fit these lines very accurately, which failed four times without fail and finally he was successful in the fifth attempt
 uttar bihar ke motihaari main gauhar hasan kaa shuruaati bachapan beetaa, iske baad ve apane bade abbu ke paas pusa chale aae jahaan ke campus public skool main unki padhai hone lagi, lekin jaise hi ve paanchavi class main pahunche bade abbu ritair ho gaye jo vahaan rajendra agriculture uniwarsity main padasthapit the
 Gauhar once again came to Motihari and passed the matriculation examination by securing 70 percent number from Iqra Public School
 metric paas karne ke baad ve dilli aa gaye jahaan unhone jamiya milia islamia se computer science main diploma kiya, uske baad saal 2008 main inhone ek america bahurashtriya company CSE main kaam karnaa shuru kiya saath hi jamiya milia islamia ke evining course ke jariye apni bi-tech kii degree bhi hasil kar lee
 In his conversation with NDTV, Gauhar explains that when he was in the final year of engineering, he decided to give civil services only and started devising his strategy from that time
 khaas baat ye he ki gauhar us vakt ek acchhee naukari main the lekin ye baat unke man main baith chuki thi ki agar desh kii pragati or samaaj ke vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa he to uske liye civil sarvent hi bananaa hoga
 Gauhar has been aspiring to work for the backward class from the beginning
 gauhar ke saath ek anuthi baat ye bhi rahi ki unhone kabhi bhi koching kaa sahaara nahin liya balki isaki jagah taiyaari ke liye ve hamdard study group kaa hissaa ban gaye saath hi mock test ke liye vijan iees se jud gaye
 He opted for Urdu as an optional subject, and with his 286 points, he proved that his election was the right one, by taking the highest number in Urdu
 gauhar bataate hai ki urdu main to unhen koi khaas dilchaspee nahin thi lekin ve mashhoor shaayar mirza gaalib ke bahut bade fain rahe hai or shaayad yahi shero shaayari kaa shauk unhen urdu ke kareeb laayaa or phir urdu ne unhen ye mukaam hasil karaayaa
 Gauhar says that he kept complete confidence in himself during the preparation, he says that documentation is very important in this exam, you read a lot of things, make it a habit to write them in one place
 facts aapako yaad rahen iske liye unka baar-baar revijan behad jaruri he
 Gauhar's message to those who prepare for the Civil Services Examination is that you first confirm your intention and if this happens, then you have won half the battle
 kisi ne sahi hi kaha he: "apane hausalon ko ye mat bataao ki tumhaari pareshaani kitni badi he
 Tell your worries how big your spirits are
 " The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, is also using the 'friendship' of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in his campaign
 darasal unki party ne chunaav prachaar ke liye ek poster bhi taiyaar kiya he jisamen piem modi or benjamin netanyahu saath dikh rahe hai
 However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party has put up photo banners with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to woo voters
 iske saath hi benjamin netanyahu ne apane twitor handle se ek video bhi share kiya he jisamen yah teenon netaa ( modi, trump or putin) shaamil hai

 At the same time, the friendship of PM Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu is also confirmed
 beete saal deepawali main hindi main ek aisa twit kiya tha jisane sabhi bharatiyon kaa dil jeet liya tha
 He wrote, 'on behalf of the people of Israel, i would like to wish my dear friend PM Narendra Modi and the people of India a happy Diwali

 Sunil Grover come back the Kapil Sharma show Two questions are currently under discussion regarding Sunil Grover and Kapil Sharma
 pehle sawaal par to kai maheenon se baat ho rahi he ki kapil or sunil kab saath kaam karnaa shuru karenge? doosraa sawaal, di kapil sharma sho kii shuruyaat ke baad lagaataar poocha ja rahaa he- kya kapil ke sho main sunil grover kii vaapasi hogi or hogi to kab tak?jawaab he- haa, kapil or sunil isi saal di kapil sharma sho main saath najar aa sakate hai
 The reason for this is a special 'pressure connection' between the two questions above
 ji haa, salmaan khan
 There are signs of this for some time
 darasal, kapil kaa sho tivi par aate hi chaa gaya he
 This time Salman is behind Kapil and is producing the show
 ve duusare celibrity guest ke taur par bhi pita or bhaaiyon ko lekar sho main pahunche
 The show has been included in the top 2 list in TRP ratings after just a few episodes
 sunil grover kyon saath aa sakate hai, iskaa jawaab salmaan hai
 This time Salman is gearing up to make Kapil's show on TV
 agar reports kii maane to sunil or kapil ke bich salmaan ne hi sulah karai he
 Everything is fine between the two kings of comedy
 pichley dinonajatakse khaas baatcheet main sunil grover ne bhi is baat ko doharaaya ki donon puraani baton ko bisar kar aage bad chuke hai
 Salman is currently working with both stars
 ek ore jahaan bataur tivi produsar kapil ke sho ke saath salmaan ne debyue kiya he, vahiin wo sunil grover ke saath bharat main kaam kar rahe hai
 The closure of "kanpur Wale Khuranaz" is also a big indication of Sunil's arrival in Kapil's show
 sunil kii maane to khuranaj ke kuch episod ke liye hi unhone sho sin kiya tha
 That is, Sunil has no other show on TV
 bhavishya main bhi unke aise kisi sho kii gunjaaish najar nahin aati
 It is believed that Sunil will return to the show with Kapil after he finishes shooting for India
 phens kii bhi yahi demand he

 a post shared bysunil Grover(@whosunilgrover) onjan 31, 2017 at 7:43am pstbarawa kii shooting ke baad sunil kya karenge?sunil grover ne soshal media par elaan kar diya he ki 40 dinon ke liye wo salmaan kii film bharat kii shooting main vyast hai
 But after that the question has been made in which project he will work
 pehle mana gaya tha ki kanpur vaale khuranaj sho se brake lekar sunil phir isi par waapas aaenge
 But the comedian himself has announced the closure of the show
 aise main unke kapil ke saath aa jane kii baat maanane ke paryaapt bahaane or maukey hai
 Kapil's show is on top
 sho ke produsar salmaan chahenge hi ki ye top par bana rahe
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak recently, Sunil also indicated that if he gets a chance in future, he will definitely work with Kapil
 yani bharat ke baad sunil ke liye ye "mauka" di kapil sharma sho hi ho saktaa he
 No, Sunil would not call Salman Bhaijaan
 to ye maanakar chalaa ja saktaa he ki kapil ke sho main sunil kii vaapasi ho sakati he
 If this happens, it is no less than a gift for those who like comedy
