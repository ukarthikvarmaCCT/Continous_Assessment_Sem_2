telugana ke karimnagar kii ek bank dakaiti ke baad vahaan kii sisitivi main ye dikh gaye
 The robbery of Karimnagar took place in February 2014
 uske teen maheene baad may 2014 main bengalooru-guwahati train main dhamaakaa hota he
 Two months later, on 10 July 2014, he is accused in the bomb blast in Farsakhana, Pune
 chennai or haryana main bhi hue ek bam dhamaake main inamen se kuch kaa naam aayaa tha
 In February 2016, Telangana police caught them from Rourkela in Odisha
 jis ghar se pakadaa vahaan ye chaar log the or inke saath ek budhi mahila bhi thi
 It is evident that his record was such that he would not have been kept in the common barrack of the Central Jail in Bhopal
 aiji bhopal kaa kahana he ki in sabhi ko alag-alag baiyrakon main rakhaa gaya tha jo alag-alag sector main hai
 There were three in two sectors and two in one
 agar police kii ye baat sahi he ki teen alag-alag baiyrakon ke cell main band ye aatankwaadi ek saath ek samay par darvaaze tod kar baahar aae yaa chaabi se khol kar
 No one noticed while breaking the doors of different cells
 kya ramashankar yadav ke paas chaabi thi
 The officers posted in different jails, on the condition of anonymity, told that the key should not be with the guard
 jailer ke paas hoti he
 It is not easy to come out of the cell of three barracks, then come from the barracks
 cell main bhi daravaaza hota he or barrack main bhi daravaaza hota he
 Inmates must break two doors between the cell and the barrack blocks
 tab bhi jail ke bheetar tainaat surakshakarmiyon ko khabar nahin hui
 Where was Ramashankar Yadav stationed and where do he encounter these criminals
 ye jaanch kaa vishay he
 Even if they run out of the barrack, can a 16 to 21 feet high wall be set only with the help of sheets and blankets
 jab ye inke sahare diwaar phaand rahe the tab jail kii bahari diwaar ke kone par bane watch tower par tainaat hathiyaarband surakshakarmi kya kar rahe the
 There is also a question that there is a power cord on the wall of the Central Jail
 kya us vakt bijli kii taar kaam nahin kar rahi thi yaa inhone taar kaat di
 Madhya Pradesh government has suspended Jail Superintendent, DIG Jail, ADG Jail
 purv police pramukh is maamle kii jaanch karenge
 The NIA will also investigate
 ye sabhi faraar qaidi ke maar diye jane kii khabar ko lekar bhi sawaal hone lagate hai
 Now two types of videos have arrived
 police kah rahi he ki inaki satyata kii abhi jaanch honi he
 a policeman refuses after shooting a video in a video as the video recording is taking place
 ek or video aayaa he jiskaa audio encounter kii theory ko sandigdh karata he
 The truth of this video also has to be proved
 jab paanch haath hilaakar sarender karnaa chaahate the to goli kyon maari gai
 The video does not show that five people want to attack the police
 sawaal abhi uth hi rahe the ki in do video ne maamle ko or bhi sandigdh bana diya he
 The runaway criminals are definitely the accused in the terror case, but their escape and the video of the encounter add many questions
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh kaa bayaan encounter ke thik baad kaa he
 The video was not revealed until then
 sawaal tab uthaa jab rajya ke grahamantri ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki faraar qaidiyon ke paas koi hathiyaar nahin tha
 They had knives and plates, with which they managed to kill and escape
 tippaniyan It is being said that the incident happened when the duty was being swapped
 tab to jail main atirikt satarkta honi chahie
 Even for a moment, if everyone was so careless, at the time of changing duty that eight prisoners escaped
 duty kii adla badali ke vakt kya baiyrakon yaa cell ke taale bhi khole jate hai
 The same thing happened in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that the terrorists took advantage of the attack amidst the exchange of units
 zarurat he ki ham seemaa se lekar jail ke bheetar tak duty or unit kii adla badali ke samay vishesh rup se satark rahen
 However, after escaping from jail, where did the weapons come from
 kyonki police kaa kahana he ki inhone police par goli chalaai
 IG Yogesh Chaudhary says four indigenous guns and three sharp-edged weapons have been recovered from the SIMI activist
 lekin ek video main sunai detaa he ki teen bhaag rahe hai or paanch khadey hokar baat karne kaa ishaara kar rahe hai
 The question is also that if the police claim is true, then how did the gun come with such a weapon within a few hours of their escape
 agar kisi giroh ne inaki madad kii he to wo kahaan the
 Did they go missing with weapons? yah bhi jaanch kaa vishay hona chahie
 Digvijay Singh of Congress has questioned the incident
 congress ke jyotiraditya sindhiya ne is ghatana par rajya police ko shaabaashi di he
 All these prisoners were members of the banned organization SIMI
 inke kilaaf alag-alag rajyon kii alag-alag adaalaton main bank lut se lekar bam dhamaakon ke aarope main maamle chal rahe the
 In the case of terror, all the security agencies of the Center and the state were looking for it
 is cese main jo aath qaidi faraar hue inamen se teen qaidi oktober 2013 main madhyapradesh kii khandava jail se bhi bhaag chuke the
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir from Hyderabad said that one of the seven prisoners who had fled from Khandwa surrendered and one was arrested
 baaki paanch aaropee lambey samay tak gaayab rahe or is dauraan bhayankar kism kii aapraadhik or aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil rahe
 In April 2015, the Telangana police killed two of these five absconding criminals
 tab telugana police ne maare gaye do logon ko group kaa leader bataaya tha
 He was seen on CCTV in Karimnagar in Telangana after a bank robbery
 karimnagar kii dakaiti farvari 2014 main hui thi
 Three months later, in May 2014, a bangalore-guwahati train explosion takes place
 do maheene baad 10 july 2014 ko pune ke farskhanaa main hue bam dhamaake main inhen aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Some of these names also came up in a bomb blast in Chennai and Haryana
 farvari 2016 main telugana kii police ne inhen urisa ke rourkela se pakadaa
 These four people were there from the house where they were caught and they were accompanied by an old woman
 zaahir he inkaa record aisa tha ki inhen bhopal kii central jail kii saamaanya barrack main nahin rakhaa gaya hoga
 IG Bhopal says that all these were kept in different barracks which are in different sectors
 do sector main teen-teen the or ek main do the
 If the police is right that these terrorists locked in the cell of three different barracks came out at the same time by breaking the door or opening it with the key
 alag-alag cell ke darvaaze todate vakt kisi ne nahin dekha
 Did Ramashankar Yadav have the key? alag-alag jelon main tainaat adhikariyon ne naam na bataaye jane kii shart par bataaya ki chaabi prahari ke paas nahin honi chahie
 The jailor has
 teen-teen baiyrakon ke cell se baahar aana, phir barrack se aana aasaan nahin he
 The cell also has a door and the barrack also has a door
 cell or barrack ke block ke bich kaidiyon ko do darvaaze todane pade honge
 Even then, security personnel inside the jail were not informed
 ramashankar yadav kahaan tainaat the or unki muthbhed in aparaadhiyon se kahaan hoti he
 This is the subject of investigation
 agar ye barrack se nikal bhi bhaage to 16 se 21 feet oonchi diwaar kya sirf chaadaron or kambalon ke sahare faandi ja sakati he
 When they were tearing down the walls with their support, what were the armed security guards deployed on the watch tower at the corner of the outer wall of the jail
 ek sawaal yah bhi he ki central jail kii diwaar par bijli kii taar hoti he
 Was the electric wire not working at that time or did they cut the wire
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne jail adheekshak, diaiji jail, ediji jail ko suspend kar diya he
 The former police chief will investigate the matter
 enie bhi jaanch karegi
 All these absconding prisoners also have questions about the news of being killed
 ab do tarah ke video aae hai
 Police are saying that their veracity is yet to be investigated
 ek video main ek goli chalaane ke baad ek pulicekarmi inkaar kar detaa he kyonki video recording ho rahi he
 There is another video whose audio suspects the theory of the encounter
 is video kii bhi satyata pramanit honi he
 Why was the bullet shot when five wanted to surrender with shaking hands? is video se nahin lagata ki paanch log police par hamalaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Questions were still arising that these two videos made the case even more suspicious
 bhaage hue apradhi aatanki maamle main aaropee zarur hai lekin unke bhaagane kaa tarika or encounter ke ye video kai sawaal jod dete hai
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh's statement is just after the encounter
 tab tak video saamne nahin aayaa tha
 The question arose when the state Home Minister while talking to NDTV said that the absconding prisoners had no weapons
 unke paas chaaku or plate the, jinaki madad se ve hatya karne or bhaagane main safal rahe
 The comments yah kaha ja rahaa he ki ghatana us vakt hui jab duty kii adla badali ho rahi thi
 Then there should be extra vigilance in the jail
 ek pal ke liye maan bhi len to kya sab itane beparwaah the, duty badalane ke vakt ki aath kaidi bhaag nikle
 Do barracks or cell locks are also opened during the exchange of duty
 jammu kashmir ke udi main bhi yahi baat ai thi ki unit kii adlabadali ke bich aatankwaadiyon ne faaydaa uthaakar hamalaa kar diya
 We need to be especially vigilant at the time of exchange of duties and units from the border to the jail
 baharhaal jail se bhaagane ke baad inke paas hathiyaar kahaan se aa gaye
 Because the police say that they opened fire on the police
 ai ji yogesh choudhary kaa kahana he ki simi activist ke paas se chaar desi bandook or teen tej dhar vaale hathiyaar baraamad hue hai
 But in one video it is heard that three are running away and five are standing and pointing to talk
 sawaal ye bhi hai ki agar police kaa daawa sahi he to inke paas bhaagane ke chand ghante ke bheetar itane hathiyaar wo bhi bandook kaise aa gai
 If a gang helped them, where were they
 kya ve hathiyaar dekar laapata ho gaye
 It should also be the subject of investigation
 congress ke digvijay singh ne is ghatana par sawaal kiya he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia of Congress has given praise to the state police on this incident
 hyderabad se hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya ki khandava se bhaage saat kaidiyon main se ek ne sarender kar diya or ek giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 The remaining five accused were missing for a long time and during this time were involved in horrific criminal and terrorist activities
 april 2015 main telugana police ne in paanch faraar aparaadhiyon main se do ko maar giraaya
 Then the two people who were killed by the Telangana police described the leader of the group

 Film Name: manjhi-the Mountain Mandirector: Ketan mehtastar Cast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Radhika Apte, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Pankaj Tripathi Duration: 124 minutescertification: u Rating: 3 starjonner: Biopic, drama'manjhi-the Mountain man'kohan Kaatan Keethan Mehta It would have been if we had known that opening 1
 40 karod se hogi to acchhee film hi bana letaa
 Why would Dalits make khichdi with the temper of politics in exploitation, love, and inspiration
 kethan mehta ko yah bhi mahasoos ho rahaa hoga ki bhale hi navazuddin aaj logon kii najar main badhiya actor hon lekin wo star nahin hai
 Even today people have not been able to rise above Shahrukh's romance, Salman's body and Akshay's action and then it is irresponsible to expect the audience to watch the film without an item song
 baharhaal dekha jaae tokethan mehta hi nahin bollywoodke ek or diggaj diarector ne is saal apana mahatvakankshi project puraa kiya tha ji haa anuraag kashyap
 Anurag made the same mistake with 'bombay Belvet' which Ketan Mehta did to 'manjhi - The Mountain Man'
 galati thi art or commercial cinema ko milaane kaa prayaas
 Now after these two, Vikas Bahl, who became King from 'queen', is also bringing a great film, the trailer is fantastic but it will be fun to see how great the film will be
 khayr ham waapas lautate he kethan mehta kii'maanjhi-da mountain main'par or jaanate he film main kya kamiyaan rah gayi jinpar agar kaam kiya jaataa to nishchit taur par 'maanjhi-da mountain main' awords dilaane ke saath-saath world level par indian cinema kii saakh bhi badhaati
 directionketan Mehta is known for his fine art films
 phir chaahe vah film 'sardaar' ho yaa 'rangarasia'
 Talking about the film 'manjhi - The Mountain Man', Ketan Mehta tried his best to make the film a mix of art and commercial, but in the vicinity of the mix, Ketan made a prize winning story
 alag-alag muddon ko film main shaamil karne ke chakkar main unhone kahani kii mul story ko halkaa kar diya
 The film does not appear to be focused on a single theme, due to which the emptiness in the film remains from beginning to end
 film kii kahani ko rochak tareeke se dikhaane ke liye unhone seens kaa sikvence aage peeche bhi kiya lekin vah sikvence justiphid nahin lagate balki chubte hai
 There are also some scenes in the film which seem to lighten the weight of the original story
 kul milakar kaha jaae to kethan mehta kii kaabiliyat kii tulana main film kaa diarection kamjor he
 In the acting film, Nawazuddin Siddiquin has imbibed the character of Dashrath Manjhi as well as the madness and passion of Manjhi which is not an easy thing for any actor
 navazuddin ke dialog bolne ke andaaj or aawaaj ke utaar-chadhaav kii samaj se navazuddin ne sabit kar diya ki vah shandaar bhi hai or jabardast bhi
 Radhika Apte lived up to Fagunia's innocence and showed that she is ready for every role
 film main mukhiya kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe tigmanshu dhulia ne apane role ke saath nyaay kiya
 Although there is a lack of newness in his acting
 film ke anya kirdaaron main ashraf ul haq ne kamaal kii acting kii he
 Ashraf played Manjhi's father very well
 film main pankaj treepathi ne apane chir-parichit andaaj main acting kii he vahiin gaurav dvivedi ne patrkaar kaa kirdaar vakubi nibhaayaa he gaurav ke kirdaar kii sabase behtareen baat yah rahi ki unka kirdaar samay ke saath maior hota dikhaai detaa he
 Screenplay Screenplay is written by Jakhar Mahendra and Ketan Mehtane
 screenple main kahani ko ghuma phiraa ke dikhaane ke chakkar main kahani kaa plot kanfujing ho gaya he
 The film consists of three plots running together that cannot connect with each other
 chaahe vah maanjhi ke padosi kii bivi kii hatya kaa seen ho yaa phir maanjhi kaa paidal dilli aana
 The scene of the Naxalite movement in the film also seems strange
 skinpldhurepan se jujhataa he or maanjhi kii jununee mohabbat kii kahani bayaan nahin kar paata he
 While watching the film, one sometimes feels that the film is a documentary made in Bollywood style
 editinaalanki is tarah kii kahani ko parde par utaarna aasaan nahin hota lekin pratik chetalia ne film main kai jagah laaparvaahee bhi barti he
 In the first half, the film does not appear to be in flux, Sean seems to be from Attapte
 film main pahaad todane ke process or seens par zyada kaam nahin kiya gaya he jisase shuruuaat se aakhir tak dimag main ek hi sawaal rahata he ki yah pahaad kaise koi ek hathode se tod saktaa he jiskaa jawaab pahaad tut jane ke baad bhi nahin miltaa he
 Had the story not been true, hardly anyone could have believed that the mountain could be broken by watching the film
 film ke ek seen main maanjhi saanp ke jehar se bachane ke liye apana angootha kaat daalata he lekin kuch seens ke baad lagata he ki angootha waapas ug gaya he
 Similarly, the climax of the film also seems monotonous
 cinemetographycenemetograr rajeev jain ne us samay ke gaanv ko camere main kaid kar hamaare saamne parosane kii ek safal koshish kii he
 But in the film, the mountain keeps growing small
 jab maanjhi pahaad chadhataa he to bilkul nahin lagata ki vah pahaad chadhana itnaa mushkil tha lekin camere main pahaad bahut vishalkay dikhataa he
 However, during the drought, the scenes of the migration of the villagers and the scenes of Manjhi craving for water make Rajiv Jain realize his ability
 lekin camere ke saath maanjhi kii kahani or bhi behatar dhang se kahi ja sakati thi

 The Central Government has raised its hands on the cleanliness of the Ganga River, the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne vaada kiya tha ki sarkaar banane ke baad ganga nadi kii safaai karvaa di jaaegi
 However, even after the creation of a separate department in the name of Namami Gange, this work has not been completed
 yahi vajah he ki piem narendra modi kii sarkaar jald corporate or aam logon ko ganga nadi kii safai ke liye aage aane ke liye kahegi
 Let us tell you that after forming the government in 2014, PM Modi created a separate department under the Ministry of Water Resources under the name Namami Gange
 saath hi mantri uma bharti ko is vibhaag kaa jimmaa saunpa
 Uma Bharti had also announced that making Ganga completely pollution free and cleaning Ganga is the biggest objective of her life
 haalanki piem modi uma bharti ke teen saal ke kaam se santusht nahin hue or unhen cabinet vistaar main jal sansaadhan mantralay se haath dhonaa padaa
 In such a situation, despite more than three years, there is not much progress on the cleanliness of the Ganges river, Narendra Modi's government has made a plan
 is yojana ke tahat ab sarkaar corporate or aam janata koganga nadeeki safai ke liye aage aane ko kahegi
 Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari has prepared a proposal
 iske tahat sarkaar ganga kinare nae ghat banane, puraane ghaaton kii saaf-safai or marammat karne, ganga kinare bane shmashaan grihon kii marammat, solid west management, nadi kii sataha kii safai, vriksharopan or ganga kinare jan-suvidhaon ke liye corporate sector or aam janata se aage aane ko kah rahi he
 Under this, the corporate sector will be asked to come forward for cleaning the Ganga under Corporate Social Responsibility
 iske liye baqayda har ghat kii safai / marammat, vriksharopan samet tamaam kaaryon ke liye anumaanit kharch kii seemaa tay karke website par daalaa gaya he jo kuch lakh se lekar karondon rupee tak he
 In its website in the Ganga, the Ministry has given information about the construction and reconstruction of new 74 ghats on the river Ganga according to the requirement on the five states through which the Ganges passes
 saath hi ganga safaai ke liye 220 puraane ghaaton kii jaankaree di gai he
 Along with this, the corporate sector and general public have been asked to come forward to build and rebuild the cremation ghats on the Ganges
 is yojana ke tahat genga nadi kii safai main madad karne waalon ko jal sansaadhan mantralayapiem modise sammanit bhi karaayega
 Let me tell you that there is one and a half year left in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the government is worried that the public will then take account of all the claims made by the government regarding the Ganga cleanliness

 In fact, the Rajya Sabha Secretariat released a list of 22 mps who repeatedly disrupt the proceedings of the House
 is list main 20 saansad bijepi ke hai or anya 2 saansad telugudesham party ke hai
 The surprising thing is that no Congress MP is named in the list
 jaise yah suchi saamne ai bijepi ne sadan main kadaa virodh jataayaa
 The BJP demanded the government to withdraw the list, angry and walked out of the House
 is list main bijepi saansad smriti irani, tarun vijay or dharmendra pradhan jaise netaaon kaa naam he
 Reacting to this list, former Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha and BJP MP Najma Heptulla said that what the speaker did is absolutely wrong
 sadan kaa har sadsy wel ke paas jaakar virodh karata he
 BJP MP Tarun Vijay has reacted sharply after being named in the list
 unhone twit kiya, 'pakistan murdaabaad kehane ke liye or antni ke bayaan par safai maangane ke liye bijepi ke 20 saansadon ko rajyasabha main hangaamaa karne vaale saansadon kii suchi main rakhaa gaya he

 shankarabhai vegad Shortly after Rahul Gandhi's attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party hit back, saying that the Congress vice-president is still a 'diaper baby'
 rahul ne saadhaa tha PM par nishanarahul ne kaha ki vasundhara raaje sarkaar kaa ‘remote’ landan main lalit modi ke paas he
 To this, the BJP replied that the Congress used to run the government with remote control and considered it the ideal, but it is not so in the BJP
 rahulne bhoomi bill or lalit modi vivaad sahit kai muddon par kendra or rajasthan sarkaron ko nishaanaa banaaya to bijepi sachiv siddharth nath singh ne bhi turant hi press conference kar rahul par palatwaar kiya
 Remembrance of Lalit Modi's tweet to Rahul, the alleged scandal under the Congress-led UPA government and the controversial land deals of Rahul's Jijarbert Vadrake as a weapon to target Rahul, saying that Rahul is wearing a 'diaper' , They have to get out of that
 rahul kii tippaniyan or vyavhaar hamen yaad dilaataa he ki vah abhi bhi diaper pahanane vaale ‘baby’ hai
 Referring to a tweet by Lalit Modi, he said through Rahul's aunt about a possible deal of Rs 500-600 crore that Rahul should speak about
 'rahul chota baccha'siddharth ne kaha ki rahul gandhi bhoomi, remote control or 56 inch par bole
 'as i have said that Rahul is a' small child 'and giving advice to a small child is not a good thing
 lekin congress unhen badi jimmedaari de rahi he isliye ham rahul ko ek nek salaah dena chaahate hai
 You have the right to criticize us but criticize us based on the facts
 ’ siddharth yaheen nahin ruke, unhone rahul ko salaah di ki vah adhik rachanaatmak bhoomika nibhaaen
 He jokingly said, 'you (rahul) wasted ten years

 'input language beshak kori anderson ke pradarshan se team india in dinon behad pareshaan he, lekin ipel frenchijis khush hai
 Yes! Due to the kind of performance Anderson has done in recent days, all IPL teams are desperate to bid on him
 17 saal baad shahid afridi ke sabase tej vanade shatak kaa record todane vaale anderson ne bharat ke khilaaf lagaataar acha pradarshan kar sandesh de diya he ki ve bade khilaadi hai or keemat bhi badi hi lenge
 The year 2014 was a big bang for Anderson
 unhone 1 janvari ke din hi shahid afridi kaa 37 gendon main banaaya sabase tej shatak kaa record tod daalaa
 Corey Anderson created a stir in the cricket world by scoring a century in 36 balls against the West Indies
 kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki kori anderson ke dwaara banaaya gaya sabase tej shatak mahaj ek tukka bhi ho saktaa he, lekin ab jis tarah se anderson ne team india ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he, usase unki kaabilayat par se shaq dur ho jaataa he
 When Mumbai Indians bought Glenn Maxwell of Australia for one million dollars at last year's auction, everyone's eyebrows were raised
 lekin kori anderson ne ab tak jis tarah ke karname anjaam die hai usase saaf he ki ve is baar ke 'million dollar baby' ban sakate hai, or shaayad is baar kisi ko koi hairaani bhi naa ho
 All franchises will try to include this player in their team
 anderson naa sirf tufaani ballebaaji karte hai, balki shandaar gendbaaji karaane main bhi sakasham hai
 Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians are believed to be in the forefront of the purchase of Corey Anderson in particular, as the coaches of all three teams come from New Zealand
 chennai ke coach stephen fleming hai to bangalore kii koching is baar danniel vittori kar rahe hai, udhar mumbai indiens kii koching kaa jimmaa bharat ke purv coach jon rhite ke paas he
 But it is said that the father is not the biggest brother, so the team that makes the biggest bid will take Anderson

 Right from the beginning of the IPL, we saw big foreign entertainers, in which Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Shahid Afridi, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Symonds, Brendon mccullum, Chris Gayle, Kerron Pollard thrilled the audience, but this time it can be That we see such an entertainer, in front of which everyone's brightness fades

 He defeated the BJP led by Narendra Modi in the Bihar elections
 yah 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad duusari sabase badi siyaasi fatah thi
 However, this success can be gauged from the distance that the two set in 2015 to come closer to each other
 pehle ye dost the, phir kattar dushman bane or beete saal dobaaraa dost ban gaye
 The condition in January was that Nitish's political career was almost on the verge of disintegration
 loksabhaa chunaav main hui sharmindagi ke baad mukhyamantri kaa pad chhodie or us par jeethanram maanjhi ko baitaane kii unhen jo keemat maanjhi ke apane daanvpech ke chalate chukaani padi, uske baad unke saamne party sanghathan ko jode rakhane kii badi chunauti thi
 He finally removed Manjhi from the post in February 2015 and was rejuvenated as a courageous, articulate and risk-taking leader
 unhone janata se maanjhi prakaran ke liye maafee maangi or dhire-dhire congress kii ore mudate gaye, jo ki aitihaasik rup se lalu kii argedy ke kareeb thi
 Lalu's condition was worse
 teen vidhansabha or do loksabhaa chunaavon main kharaab pradarshan karne ke baad lalu apana siyaasi vajood bachaane kii jang lard rahe the
 Worse, he was disqualified from contesting elections as he was convicted in the fodder scam
 ab ve ek pareshaan pita banakar ubhare jo apane donon beton ko raajnneeti main sthapit karne kii ladaai lard rahaa tha&thode satark, thode ghabaraae hue or phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakhane vaale shaks
 Together, the two managed to consolidate the mathematics of the vote, which became formidable for the opposition NDA
 chunaav haalanki ganit se aage kii cheez he
 The question was always how close the two would be
 lalu ne bhale hi mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa bananaa manjuur kiya or aakhirkaar mukhyamantri pad ke liye nitish ke naam par muhar laga di thi, lekin bich-bich main yah gathbandhan bhram, algaav or niraashaa kii chapet main fansata or dikhataa rahaa
 This situation remained till August
 iske baad haalanki chizon ne teji se karavat badali
 The ideal balance and harmony between Lalu and Nitish remained, from the distribution of seats to the announcement of candidates and finally the plan to campaign for each other's candidates
 ek se ek kaddavar rajnatik jodisson ke liye bhi yah jodi aaj rashk kaa kaaran he
 Behind the common man's big bang: Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister, Delhi This year was not to be named after Arvind Kejriwal, there was no such scope visible at a distance
 desh ke tamaam siyaasi panditon or nazoomiyon kaa yahi andaja tha ki purv iskar adhikari, artiai kaaryakarta, lokapal andolan ke netaa, aam aadmi party ke mukhiya kaa vakt aayaa or biit gaya
 But the former Chief Minister of Delhi weaved such a narrative of a return to power, and made the bjp-based political machine redundant, which was never seen and heard in Indian politics
 2015 main kejariwal ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko unke nae garh main chunauti di or bijepi ko aisi galtiyaan karne ko uksaaya ki usne dilli kaa mukhyamantri pad lagbhag unhen tashtaree main paroskar saunp diya
 In his victory in 67 seats out of a total of 70, the bjp's haste to declare an outsider Kiran Bedi as a leader on the last occasion was helpful
 iskaa asar aisa aitihaasik hua ki isse ajey modi fike dikhne lage
 They were surrounded by opposing voices from all around
 lekhakon-kalakaaron ne “sammaan vaapasi” kii muhim chalaai to saal ke ant main nitish kumaar or lalu prasad ne bihar ke chunaavon main bijepi kii chulein hilaa deen
 Chief Minister Kejriwal remained in the news throughout the year
 pehle, apni party main yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan jaise “asantushton” ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya or phir bhrashtachar tathaa pradooshan par aguai lekar ve surkhiyaan lutate rahe
 Kejriwal also showed the acrobatics of using them in his own right as the central government created obstacles for him through Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung
 apane radio prasaranon or bekhauf intervyuu se ve desh main modi ke baad surkhiyaan paane vaale sabase kaddavar netaa sabit hue
 -kunal Pradhan Heir of his land: Rahul Gandhi, Vice President, Before the Congress year 2015, Rahul Gandhi continued to make headlines on important issues of the country, especially with his silence, or the blatant apathy
 unki chuppi maukey-bemauke kuch naatakeey harkaton se tuutati rahi
 For example, tearing down copies of an ordinance of his own party-led government called it "rubbish"
 yaa daliton ko adhikaar sampann karne ke liye “brihaspati grah jaisi aswabhaavik gati” kaa formula pesh kiya jise kuch to samaj nahin paae, baakiyon ke liye hansi kaa masala ban gaya
 Then, the summer of 2014, like humiliation of insults rained
 congress apane sabase bure daur 44 saansadon tak simatakar rah gai
 Rahul proved redundant even before taking command of the party
 aise hi vakt main 2015 kaa padaarpan hua
 The Congress vice president mysteriously disappeared
 unki party ne 23 farvari ko sansad kaa bajet satr shuru hone ke baad unki chuttee kaa elaan kiya
 But Rahul found his voice in this era of anonymity
 ve apane 56 dinon kii gumnami main teen hafte vipashyana karte rahe, jiske dauraan puraa maun rakhaa jaataa he
 Then, he appeared at the Congress rally against the Land Acquisition Bill at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on 19 April and led his party's mps to almost stall the rainy session of Parliament
 ve abhi bhi chutile sanvaadon or muhaavaron kii talash main the

 court main mangalvaar se is par sunwaayee chal rahi thi
 Now Asaram will be in judicial custody for 14 days
 haalanki bachaav paksh ke vakeelon ne kaha he ki aadesh ke adhyayan ke baad ve hai court main jamaanat ke liye applai karenge
 The government side said that his arguments were won and the court did not release Asaram as he could come out and influence the evidence and investigation
 asaram philhal jodhpur central jail main band he
 Asaram had mobilized an army of top lawyers from Delhi and Mumbai for his bail
 vah subah se jail main baichaiyn tahal rahe the or do vakil jamaanat kii arji par aayaa faisla bataane ke liye vahi baithe the
 But in his decision given at five o'clock in the evening, the court broke his hopes and gave his decision
 ab hai court main bahes tak to unka jail main rahanaa tay hi he
 Here are two reasons for Asaram's bail to be rejected: Asaram's lawyer was saying that the girl is an adult and therefore the FIR filed under sexual assault of a minor should be dismissed
 magar sarkari paksh ne ladki kaa hai skool kaa certificate pesh kiya or supreme court ke ek maamle kii nazeer di
 Asaram's lawyer said that my client is very old and sick, he needs medical help
 is par sarkari paksh ne kaha ki aadmi boodha tab hota he, jab dimag kuch or soche or sharir use maanane se inkaar kar de
 Asaram is fully active, was preaching from place to place, now suddenly there was talk of illness
 bel khaarij hone main doosraa ahm point rahaa, asaram ke do bhagode vaanchhiton shilpa or prakaash kaa police kii giraft se dur hona
 Government lawyer Anand Purohit argued that if Asaram comes out on the jail, the investigation into the case will be affected and may trick the remaining accused
 police, peedit or media ko dhamkee kaa bhi rahaa angelrajasthan police ke asipi chanchal sharma ne on record bataaya ki unke disipi ko lagaataar dhamkiyaan mil rahi hai asaram ke gut kii taraf se
 The victim's father also told the court that he was being threatened to withdraw the case
 court ke faisle ke khilaaf ho rahe pradarshnon ne bhi asaram kaa maamla kamjor kiya
 Said the government lawyer, i have 100 Anandjeet's zealous Anand Purohit, who first taught the media knowledge on discipline
 phir kaha ki mere khyaal se aise krity karne vaale ko isse bada jhatka hindustan main koi nyaay palika nahin de sakati
 Justice considers everyone equal
 aadmi bada yaa chota nahin hota
 i thank the media for raising such matter well
 aakhri main purohit bole ki unke paas ek hathiyaar tha, to main bhi bahes main 100 hathiyaar lekar gaya tha

 com / 7gj1lie9qh— Captains (@dhonikohli_fc)june 11, 2017 Uttar Pradesh 10th and 12th board examinations have started from today
 pichley saal nakal par nakel kasne main badi uplabdhi hasil karne ke baad is baar bhi pariksha main nakal rokane ke liye kade kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 Even before this, the UP government has done many things to raise the level of education in the state
 jaanate hai mukhyamantri yogi adityanath sarkaar ne aakhir koun-koun se ahm kadam uthaae hai
 
 
 New software prepared this time to avoid changes in answer sheets, a software has been created, which will monitor the entire process
 saath hi ek chaar step vaala process taiyaar kiya gaya he, jis prakriya ke tahat kaapiyon kaa bantwaaraa kiya jayega or unhen janchi jayega
 Also, codes will be placed on the copies and sets of paper will also be made
 samay par parikshaayen or nattizeyyogi sarkaar parikshaon ke sahi samay par aayojan karne or pariksha khatm hone ke kuch din baad hi nattejey jari karne main safal hui he
 Last year too, the government had released the results soon after conducting the exam, due to which the students studying after 12th should not have difficulty in getting admission
 is baar bhi pariksha kaa aayojan farvari main kiya ja rahaa he or bataaya ja rahaa he ki pariksha ke rigelt bhi jald hi jari kar die jaaenge
 Restriction on copying - The government has claimed that the board has succeeded in curbing duplication
 sarkaar kii ore se nakal rokane ke liye uthaae gaye kadam kii vajah se pichley saal bhi nakal par nakel kii vajah se 10 lakh parikshaarthiyon ne bich main hi pariksha chhod di thi
 Because of this, less people have applied this time for fear of copying
 is baar bhi ummidavaaron kii sankhya main 9 lakh kii kami hui he
 NCERT course-up Board has also planned to introduce NCERT course to enhance the level of education
 pichley saal janvari main kiye gaye is faisle main kaha gaya tha ki ab upi board ke vidhyaarthee bhi ensiiarti course kii padhai bhi karenge
 Foreign Language - Every board exam also has a subject in third language and such was the case in UP board
 haalanki ab in bhashaaon main videshi bhashaaon ko jodne kii baat bhi saamne aa rahi he
 With this, students studying in UP board will also be able to study foreign languages
 paas honge pariksha centre-upi board main pehle pariksha centre ko lekar kaaphi dikkat hoti thi, lekin ab sarkaar kii nai niti ke anusaar ummidavaaron kaa pariksha centre 20 kilometre se zyada dur nahin hoga

 " gyaat ho ki rus ne gaddaphi ke saath sambandh sthapit kiya tha or abhi haal tak vah nai libian sarkaar ko manyata nahin dena chahta tha
 At present, there is no trace of Gaddafi's whereabouts
 libya main rus-italy urja samjhaute kaa bhavishya spasht nahin he, kyonki pashchimi deshon ne bhi elephant pariyojna main apni ruchi dikhaai he

 @ shahidkapoor # mirakapoora post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Sep 6, 2018 at 5:39 am PDT maharashtra or haryana main bijepi kii sarkaar ban rahi he
 Devendra Fadnavis and Manohar Lal Khattar will be the chief ministers
 pradhanmantri modi or bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne donon ke pichley kaarykaal kii tarif kii he or aage ke liye badhai de di he
 The public has also strengthened the opposition in this election
 satta nahin di he
 If we look at the opposition camp, the Nationalist Congress Party and Jananayak Janata Party fought the rest of the Congress, it is being said that its candidates were fighting but the party could not be seen
 maharashtra ke chunaavon kii do tasveeron kii baat se is chunaav kii kahani shuru karte hai
 Which prevailed over those who prepared the storm of publicity
 barish main bhaashan dete hue sharad pavaar kii yah tasviir 19 aktubar kii he
 Of Satara Lok Sabha constituency
 79 saal ke pavaar bheegate rahe or aadhe ghante tak bhaashan dete rahe
 In the Satara Lok Sabha by-election, Pawar was campaigning against the candidate who won the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from his party
 shivasena ke vanshaj maane jane vaale udayan raaj bhonsle apni seat se istipha dekar bijepi se lard rahe the
 Udayan Raj had won this seat thrice but lost from BJP ticket
 ab pavaar kii bheengti hui is tasviir ke saamne bijepi kii is tasviir ko dekhie jise bijepi ne ikonic pikchar bataaya tha
 It seems that this picture has been taken from the whole planning so that Prime Minister Modi's profile matches Shivaji's profile
 donon ek hi frem main ek jaise nazar aane lage, lekin is ikonic seat kaa khaas nateeja nahin niklaa
 It is true that this is the picture of Panvel and the BJP candidate has won from here
 agar is ikonic seat kaa jaadu chalata to bijepi akele sarkaar bana rahi hoti
 Pawar's picture definitely became iconic
 unki sarkaar bhale na bani magar unki party ne apana kila phir se majboot kar liya
 This photo of Pawar will be seen and heard like a legend among the leaders of the opposition
 shivasena kii kya bhoomika hogi? uddav thakare 50-50 formule kii baat kar rahe hai
 The formula for Chief Minister of BJP and two and a half years was decided by two and a half years
 yah formula na to sapa-basapa ke bich upi main chalaa or na hi jammu kashmir main pidipi-bijepi ke bich chalaa
 Shiv Sena has not got 63 seats like last time, but BJP has reduced by 20-22 seats
 shivasena ko laga tha ki use phir se bada bhai banane kaa mauka mila he
 Uddhav Thackeray said that Amit Shah may also need to come to talk about how the government will be, but the head of the government was announced in Delhi itself
 tab bhi jab uddhav thakare ne yah bhi kaha ki ve har baar bijepi ke liye jagah nahin chodenge
 One party is not dominant in Maharashtra politics
 jaisaa pehle tha vaisaa ho gaya he
 It was felt that Devendra Fadnavis has dealt with everyone within and outside his party, he is not
 shivasena, ensipi ke alaava congress ne bhi acha hi kiya he
 Independents and new parties have 31 seats
 maharashtra main janata ne chunaav ladaa he
 The public was fighting for their issues, but the parties were fighting the people on their issues
 media sattadhari party ke saath chunaav lard rahaa tha
 The storm of publicity failed in front of the public wind
 maharashtra kisi ek kaa nahin he, magar bijepi sabase badi party he
 Why did Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis have to say that 15 illiterate mlas have approached him and he is ready for support
 sharad pavaar bhi kah rahe hai ki shivasena ke saath sarkaar nahin banaaenge
 NCP did well
 jise mana ja rahaa tha ki samaapt ho jaaegi
 Congress was also said to be clean, but its candidates have done well, but this is not done by the performance of Congress
 ek majboot vipaksh kii bhoomika mili he
 In terms of politics, the wealthier society through which Pawar was tried to stop
 pavaar kii party ne dhanagar bahul kshetra main bijepi se zyada siten jiti hai
 Pankaja Munde lost the election by 30,000 votes
 baraamati se ensipi ke ajit pavaar maharashtra main sabase adhik voton se jeetne vaale netaa hai
 Defeated BJP candidate by 1 lakh 65 thousand 265 votes
 sharad pavaar shuukravaar ko satara ja rahe hai dhanyavad karne
 Will visit the state after Diwali
 haryana main kya hua? eggzet pole ke daavon ke hisaab to nahin hua, lekin pichhali baar kii tulana main 7 siten kam hone ke baad bhi pradhanmantri modi haryana kii jeet ko abhootpurv bataa rahe hai
 The opposition and experts are telling Manohar Lal Khattar the reason for the bjp's poor performance, but the Prime Minister praised Manohar Lal Khattar
 unhen phir se mukhyamatri banaae rakhane kaa elaan kar diya
 Jananayak Janata Party has got 10 seats and Congress 31
 congress ko 16 siton kaa phayda mila

 The most auspicious day of Shiva worship is Monday and a large gathering of devotees can be seen in this Shiva temples
 saare devon main shiv hi aise dev hai jo apane bhakton kii bhakthi-puja se bahut jaldi hi prasann ho jate hai
 Shiva Bhole is considered to be Adi and Anant who is seated in every element from earth to sky and water to fire
 shiv puja main bahut si aisi chijen arpit kii jaati hai jo anya kisi devtaa ko nahin chadhaai jaati, jaise- aak, bilvapatr, bhaang aadi
 Similarly, there are many such things in Shiv Pooja which can harm you instead of giving the fruits of your worship
 
 
 1
 Turmeric: Turmeric enhances the taste of food as well as turmeric has been considered an important place in religious functions
 lekin shivaji kii puja main haldi nahin chadhaai jaati he
 Turmeric is mainly used in cosmetics
 shastron ke anusaar shivlinga purushatv kaa pratik he, isi vajah se mahadev ko haldi nahin chadhaai jaati
 2
 phool:shiv ko kaner or camel ke alaava laal rang ke phool priy nahin hai
 It is prohibited to offer Ketki and Kevade flowers to Shiva
 3
 Kumkum or Roli: According to the scriptures, Kumkum and Roli are not applied to Shiva
 4
 Shankh is prohibited in Shiva worship: Shankh is very dear to Lord Vishnu, but Shiv ji was a devil hunter named Shankhchur, hence Shankh is considered taboo in worship of Lord Shiva
 5
 Coconut water: One should not acclaim Lord Shiva with coconut water as coconut is considered to be the form of Lakshmi, hence coconut is taken as a Prasad in all auspicious work
 lekin shiv par arpit hone ke baad nariyal pani grahan yogya nahin rah jaataa he
 6
 tulsi dal:tulsi kaa patta bhi bhagwaan shiv ko nahin chadhaanaa chahie
 In this context, there is the story of Asura Raj Jalandhar, whose wife Vrinda became the plant of Tulsi
 shiv ji ne jalandhar kaa vadh kiya tha isliye vrinda ne bhagavanshiv kii puja main tulsike patton kaa prayog na karne kii baat kahi thi
 Things that are offered in Shiva worship are milk, curd, honey, ghee, sugar, perfume, sandalwood, saffron, cannabis
 in sabhi chizon ko ek saath milakar yaa ek-ek cheez shivlinga par chadha sakate hai
 It is told in Shivpuran that bathing the Shivling with these things fulfills all desires
 10 chijen or unase milane vaale fal1
 Offering water on the Shivling while chanting mantras calms our nature
 aacharan snehamay hota he
 2
 shahad chadhaane se hamaari vaani main mithaas aati he
 3
 doodh arpit karne se uttam swasthya miltaa he
 4
 dahi chadhaane se hamaara swabhaav gambhir hota he
 5
 shivlinga par ghi arpit karne se hamaari shakti badhati he
 6
 itra sesnan karwaane se vichaar pavitra hote hai
 7
 shivaji ko chandan chadhaane se hamaara vyaktitv aakarshak hota he
 Honor is received in society
 8
 By offering saffron we get mildness
 9
 By offering cannabis, our disorder and evils are removed
 10
 Sugars increase happiness and prosperity
 shiv pujan kii saamaanya vidhijis din shiv pujan karnaa chaahate hai, us din subah snaan aadi nity karmon se nivrutt hokar pavitra ho jaaen
 After this, go to the temple of the house itself or any Shiva temple
 mandir pahunchakar bhagwaan shiv ke saath mata parvati or nandi ko gangaajal yaa pavitra jal arpit karen
 After offering water, offer sandalwood, rice, bilvapatra, figure flowers and datura on the Shivling
 pujan main is mantra kaa jap karenmandaramalanklitalakayai kapaalamaalankitshekharai

 How does it feel to miss home, ask these questions to someone living away from home
 
 
 jawaab main ek nahin chaar baaten bataai jaaengi
 The challenge is that going away from home, the challenge of studying and working is doubled rather than easy
 lekin kai tareeke hai jisase aap apni homasicnes ko kam karne ke saath behatar thug se jindagi guzaar sakate hai
 1
 ghar phone karen:yah bhale hi kaaman sens kii baat lage lekin yah bahut madadgaar sabit hota he
 Now do not do that even four to five times a day, you are calling at home
 din main ek baar hi phone karen or sakaaratmak baaten karen
 If you are missing your friends and family, then calling them may ease your pain a little
 2
 Go home: You can also recharge yourself by going home
 kuch din ghar rahakar puraani dincharya ko doharaaen
 Eat your mother's food
 apane room main soen
 This will make you feel good
 lekin zyada ghar janaa aap par ulta pad saktaa he
 It increases home sickness
 jarurat mahasoos hone par hi ghar jaaen
 Do not make it a routine for every week
 3
 Go out with college friends: Sometimes going on a night out with your college friends can change your mood
 isse aapako apane ghar ko bhuulane main madad milegi
 4
 puraane doston ko phone karen:ho saktaa he ki skool khatm hote hi saare dost alag-alag collejon main chale gaye ho
 Always call friends who are in your hometown
 unase baat karne se aap rifresh mahasoos karenge
 Keep making plans to meet friends who are in your city
 5
 Get out of your room: It is very easy to sit in your class in college
 lekin ye aapako nae logon se milane se, nai chijen tri karne se or college life kaa anubhav karne se roktaa he
 Go out of your class room
 college ke cantienmen bainthe, librari jaaen, activities main hissaa len
 Put your mind elsewhere
 isse aap duusare kaamon main biji rahenge or aapako ghar kii yaad nahin aegi

 Now in Sarabjit, some similar questions arise about Aishwarya Rai
 film ek galati se jindagi bhar dard jhelane vaale shaks or uske parivaar ko parade par us tarah nahin utaar paati he, jaisaa utaarna chahie tha
 It is also amazing whether Aishwarya is trying to make her USP screaming after her return to Bollywood or Bollywood directors are deliberately getting her to do so

 He is a farmer

 If anything is worth watching in the film, he is Randeep Hooda
 unhone khud ko jis tarah role main utaara he vah kamaal he

 rajasthan kii bhoomi par chunavi ran kaa aarambh ho gaya he
 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje herself is taking charge of the election campaign for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and today the Congress national president Rahul Gandhi is reaching Jaipur to flag off the Congress campaign
 yani congress ke chunavi bigul kaa shankhanaad jaipur kii dharti se ho rahaa he
 This is the first time that Rahul is reaching Jaipur after getting the command of the Congress party and is doing road shows there
 jaipur na sirf rajya kii rajdhani he, balki siton ke lihaaj se bhi yah jila sabase zyada mahatvapurn he or is par congress kii najar he
 Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot has also said that he will prove the bjp's claim to be strong in Jaipur false
 haalanki, payalat ne jaipur ko lekar ek or vajah bhi bataai
 According to him, Gandhi is coming to the state for the first time after becoming the party's national president and this is the city from where he was made the party's vice-president
 is kaaran se congress party ke liye jaipur ek mahatvapurn sthaan he
 There are a total of 19 assembly seats in the Mathematics Jaipur district of Jaipur district
 inamen se 14 siten saamaanya hai, 3 anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hai or 2 anusuchit janajati ke liye arakshit kii gai hai
 This district with 13 tehsils has a Hindu population of about 87 percent
 jabaki 10 fisad ke kareeb muslim jansankhya hai
 Scheduled Caste population in the district 15
 1% or anusuchit janajati kii jansankhya 8% he
 52 in this district to be seen in terms of urban and rural population
 4% log shahari kshetron main rahete hai, jabaki gramin aabaadi 47
 6%
 aamtaur par shahari aabaadi main bhartiya janata party ko majboot mana jaataa he
 The election results also seem to confirm this
 rajya ke pichley do vidhansabha chunaav kii baat kii jaae to jaipur jile main bhi parinaam bijepi ke paksh main hi gaye hai
 Result of 2008 assembly election (jaipur) In this election the district had a total of 35,38,921 votes and 22,58,054 (63)
 8%) logon ne apane maton kaa istemaal kiya tha
 39 to BJP
 4%, congress ko 37
 8%, Independents 16% and Bahujan Samaj Party 3
 1% vot mili the
 While BJP won the maximum 10 seats
 bijepi- 10 sitcongress- 7 sitaloktantric samaajawaadee party- 1 sitanirdaleey- 1 seat2013 vidhansabha chunaav kaa rigelt (jaipur)is chunaav main jile main kul 39,11,600 matadaat the or 28,76,745 (73
 5%) people used their votes
 bijepi ko 47
 6% and Congress 34
 2% vot hasil hue the
 While 8
 8% vot nirdaleey ummidavaaron ke khate main gaye the
 The National People's Party received a total of 7 percent of the vote
 bijepi- 16 sitcongress- 1 sitanirdaleey- 1 sitnational pipuls party- 1 seat2008 ke chunaav main congress sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi or use 96 siten mili thim
 Whereas BJP had to satisfy 78 seats
 17 anya ke alaava bispi ko 6 or sipiem ko 3 siton par jeet mili thi
 The Congress formed the government in Rajasthan under the leadership of Ashok Gehlot, but in Jaipur district, the BJP won 3 seats more than the Congress while retaining the lead over the Congress
 ye bhi padhein-rajasthan main baja chunavi bigul, ye he vidhansabha kaa ganitiske baad 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab satta virdohi lahar chali to bijepi ne puure rajya sahit jaipur jile main lagbhag clin sweep kar diya
 BJP won 163 out of the total 200 assembly seats and its candidates won 16 out of 19 seats in Jaipur
 jaipur main congress mahaj ek seat hi hasil kar pai
 In this way, when the BJP did its best, its candidates won most of the seats in Jaipur district and Congress collapsed
 aisa hi kuch 2017 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main dekhne ko mila tha
 Where the Congress could win only 3 seats out of 18 seats in Surat district, which proved to be a big factor in the bjp's return to power and won 15 seats
 jabaki gramin kshetron main congress ko ummid se behatar nattejey mili the
 The mention of Surat is also important because Ashok Gehlot played the most important role in the election there
 gahalot ke pradarshan se rahul gandhi santusht bhi najar aae the, jiske baad unhen rashtriya raajnneeti main ahm jimmedaari di gai
 Although, Ashok Gehlot is not directly in command in Rajasthan, but his role is considered very important
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki sachin payalat ke netritv main upachunaav or sthaneey nikaay chunaav main behatar pradarshan kar rahi congress jaipur fatah karne ke liye kya ranneeti apanaati he
 It will also be interesting to see how the combination of young Congress leaders Rahul and Sachin Pilot in the presence of a big strategist like Ashok Gehlot can affect the urban population of Jaipur
 ye bhi padhein-kya ninama kii ghatol seat par ek baar phir hoga parivartan? The Modi government's cabinet on Thursday approved a policy for coal linkage to power companies, which has been named 'shakti'
 shakti policy ke tahat bijli companiyon ko koyala dene ke niyamon main sarkaar kai badlaav karne ko taiyaar he
 Coal linkage will also be available to power companies through auction
 jin power companiyon ke paas kol linkage nahin he, unako nae niyam se phayda milegaa
 Those who have PPA (power Purchase Agreement) will be given priority over coal linkage
 pradhanmantri narendra modiki adhyakshata main aarthik maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti (CCEA) ne letters of astaurance holders (LOA) ke saath eendhan aapurti qaraar (FSA) par dastakhat ko manjuuri de di he
 Companies which do not have coal linkage even after PPA, will also get relief under Shakti policy
 aise kareeb 12 hajaar megawatt ke plant hai, jinke paas pipie to hai lekinkoyla nahin he
 After this policy, now power companies will be able to bid on Coal India Notified Price to get coal linkage
 lekin ye linkage central janarating companiyaan, state or joint ventures ko power ministry kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par hi power companiyon ko milegaa
 In this way, allocation of coal linkage in future will be transparent and bidding based
 policy main power sector ke project ko koyale kii uplabdhta par jor dene se iffrastracchar or banking sector ko bhi teji milegi
 PPA holders will reduce tariffs for linkages, which ultimately will result in cheaper electricity rates for consumers

 bukhari, mulaayam singh yadav ke grih jile itawa se samaajawaadee sarkaar kii vaada khilaaphi ke viruddh 21 april se abhiyaan chhedenge
 On Friday, when the Samajwadi Party, the state government was immersed in the happiness of completing its one year, then there was silence on 3, Vikramaditya Marg
 ye kothi he sarkaar ke kaddavar mantri or party ke muslim netaajam khanki, jinhen shaayad apni party kaa jashn raas nahin aayaa
 It is being told that Azam, Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh did not even go to meet Yadav
 sutara bataate he ki ajam apane ghar se baahar nahin nikle or na hi kisi se bhi mili jo unke ghar pahunche the unase milane
 The guard at the gate told that the health of the minister is bad
 vahin sunaane main aa rahaa he ki ajam aajkal akhilesh or mulaayam donon se hi naaraaz hai
 Why this resentment could not be known, but this news is also believed to be confirmed that the minister, who has spoken about the illness, has left his home district Rampur after catching a train at night
 bukhari or ajam kii sarkaar se berukhi ke baad sawaal uthne laga he ki sapa sarkaar kii pehali varshgeth par hi uski muslim raajnneeti ke karnadhaar unase alag khadey najar aaye
 Maulana accused the Samajwadi government that at the time of the 2012 assembly elections, it supported the SP on the promise of equal participation to Muslims

 do minute 26 second
 The entire Kahani, which gives a heart-wrenching feeling from Delhi's zoo, is limited in just two minutes and 26 seconds
 ek insaan or jaanavar ke darmyaan jindagi or maut ke bich shah or maat kaa ekatarfa khel khelaa gaya
 a game whose life and death had been decided before it even started
 makasuud ne apni jindagi beshak gumnami ke andhere main nikaal di, lekin maut ne use naam de diya
 Few people were aware of Maqsood, who lived in Anand mountain area of delhi
 jo use jaanate bhi the to bas ek manamaujee or dimagi taur par biimaar shaks ke taur par
 But Maqsood got such a death that his picture reached every house
 rickshaw chalaata tha makasuudamakasood in dinon industrial aria main rickshaw chalaa kar 60-65 rupee kama liya karata tha
 On Tuesday too, he had left the family by asking to go to work
 lekin kaam par naa jaakar wo chidyaghar pahunch gaya or phir der saver gharavaalon tak uski maut kii khabar pahunchi
 The family members also got her married to a girl from Vardhman in West Bengal
 lekin shaayad makasuud kaa mizaaj hi tha, jiske kaaran uski bivi bhi use chhodkar chali gai
 a tiger that has never hunted any goat in the last 6 years, the same tiger killed Maqsood in 2 minutes 26 seconds
 is ghatana ke peeche kii hakeekat afsos paidaa karti he, kyonki jaankaron kii maane to apane baade main aa gire maksadu ko ye baagh maarna nahin chahta tha
 But known and unknown humans made that mistake, after which the tiger got angry and he took the life of an helpless person
 tasviren gavaah hai ki baagh makasuud ko nahin maarna chahta tha
 At least this is what the pictures of the initial few moments say
 makasuud kii surat main ek insaan ke baade main aa girane ke baavjood baagh ne us par hamalaa nahin kiya, balki use samajhane yaa phir usase khilne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 If a tiger named Pattharvijay, who became the trigger of death, could attack him as soon as he fell into the enclosure of Maqsood
 use daboch saktaa tha
 But he came close to Maqsood and started watching him carefully
 yahaan tak ki vijay ne ek-do baar panjon se use chune or samajhane kii koshish kii or hawa main apni dum kuch aise hilaataa rahaa, jaise wo usase khilne kii koshish kar rahaa ho
 But Honi probably had something else approved
 darasal, chidyaghar prashasan kii laaparvaahee ke bich logon kii bheed hi apane tareeke se makasuud ko bachaane kii koshish karti rahi
 But in the same attempt, as soon as the crowd hit the tiger with a stone, an angry tiger grabbed Maqsood's neck
 maut kii un dardanaak tasveeron ko dekhne vaale wild life exparts kaa bhi kahana he ki agar ju prashasan ne tab mustaidi dikhaai hoti, to makasuud kii jaan bachaai ja sakati thi
 The Zoo administration itself also believes that this tiger of six years never hunted in his entire age
 aadamkhor hona to bahut dur kii baat he, kyonki vijay kii paidaaish lakshmana or yamuna naam ke ek aise jode se hui, jo pehle se reva ke ju main band the
 In such a situation, Vijay did not get hunting training from his mother nor did he ever kill any animal
 alabatta dilli main ju prashasan se har roj milanevaale das kilo maance se hi wo apana kaam chalaata tha
 Even in terms of food, Vijay is lazy
 ju ke karmchaariyon kii maane to wo roj milane vaala das kilo maance bhi jaldi main nahin, balki kai ghanton main gum phir kar khaataa he
 It is quite possible that on Tuesday, Vijay would have spared Maqsood who had fallen in his enclosure, if the Zoo administration had managed to divert him from Maqsood before he had already diverted his attention
 uske liye jo sabase pehali or jaruri shart thi, wo thi uske baade ke paas se duusare logon ko dur karnaa
 But in doing all this, the administration's kahili proved fatal for Maqsood

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke khasmkhas rahe mukul roy ne shuukravaar ko bijepi kaa daaman beshak tham liya lekin wo utsaah nahin dikhaa jo amuman aise maukon par dikhaai detaa he
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and bjp's Bengal in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya were also present to welcome former Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy at the BJP headquarters in Kahane to be called
 lekin naa to samarthakon kii ore se koi narebaaji kii ja rahi thi or naa hi gulab kii pankhudiyaan dikhaai de rahi thim
 It seemed as if the decision to accommodate Roy in the party was taken out of mind
 roy ke daaman par kathith bhrashtachar ke daagon se haath aasaani se nahin dhoe ja sakate
 Roy Sarada has been on the radar of the cbi's investigation into the chit fund scam
 ye vahi ghotaalaa he jise pashchim bengal main bijepi kii reliyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah uthaate rahe hai
 However Roy has always denied any of his role in the scam
 vahiin trinmul congress se jude sutron ko ashanka he ki kahin roy CBI ko aise ahm suraag naa muhaiyaa kara den jisase ki agency ko TMC ke anya netaaon par abhiyog lagane main aasaani ho
 Sarada is one of the scams which has affected the lower middle class and the poor the most
 unke jivan bhar kii kamai is ghotaale ke bhent chadh gai
 After this came the Narada scam in which TMC leaders were seen taking bribe in the sting
 TMC main mamata banerjee ke baad kabhi sabase taqatvar netaa samajhe jane vaale roy ke rutabe kaa andaaj isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 2012 main manmohan singh mantrimandal main unhen railway jaise ahm mahakme kaa mantri banaaya gaya tha
 Now the same Roy will be the face of BJP in West Bengal
 bijepi ke paas aisa koi rabar nahin he jo roy kii slate se us ateet ko mitaa de ki sting main unka bhi naam aayaa tha or CBI ne unke khilaaf FIR bhi darj kii thi
 Roy also came under the scrutiny of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 aise main shuchita or naitikta kii tamaam duhai dene vaali partibijepi kekendriya netritv kii roy ke saath manch saajha karne kii duvidha ko samajha ja saktaa he
 In a brief speech, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called Roy an experienced leader but then took a quick farewell from the event citing busyness elsewhere
 isse pehle bhi roy ko ‘11, ashok road’ sthit bijepi mukhyalay ke baahar kuch der intjaar karnaa padaa kyonki kailash vijayawargeey tab tak nahin pahunche the
 Roy did not want to give the impression that he had to wait to join the BJP
 kahani yaheen nahin khatm ho jaati
 The bjp's West Bengal unit appeared completely alienated by Roy's entry into the saffron camp
 chandra bose ko chhodkar bengal bijepi se koi ahm cheharaa is maukey par nahin dikhaai diya
 Let me tell you that Chandra Bose has also recently held the bjp's lotus
 haalanki bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv rahul sinha, jo party kii bengal unit ke purv adhyaksh bhi rah chuke hai, ke roy ke saath achche rishte bataae jate hai
 Actually, Rahul Sinha had also invited Roy on his birthday a few days ago
 lekin rahul sinha jaisi baat roy ke liye or bijepi netaaon ke bare main nahin kahi ja sakati
 Even Bengal BJP President Dilip Ghosh did not tweet from his official handle about Roy's reception in BJP
 haalanki jab ghosh ke sahyogiyon ne dhyaan dilaayaa to unhone kaaphi der baad kailash vijayawargeey kii ore se roy kii bijepi main entry ko lekar kiye gaetvit corettvit bhar kar diya
 Rupa Ganguly, a Rajya Sabha MP who is considered the female face of BJP in West Bengal, did not bother to tweet about Roy till the time of writing this report
 yahi baat locket chatarji ke liye bhi kahi ja sakati he
 An insider associated with the Bengal BJP said on condition of anonymity, 'all this will depend on what role Roy plays in Bengal in the coming days
 agar wo apane hisaab se chizon ko chalaane kii koshish karenge to vaaki unke liye rasta aasaan nahin sabit hoga
 'whenever Roy's name is taken, the name of Siddharth Nath Singh, currently minister of UP and former Bengal party convenor, automatically comes to mind
 kabhi singh ke kolkata ke ek maidan se die jumale ne bahut surkhiyaan batori thim or wo tha- ‘bhaag mukul bhaag’
 a lot has changed in two years
 lekin ek baat ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa ki bijepi main, centre or rajya main donon jagah, bahut saare netaaon ko mukul raay kii entry ko hajam karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Because he had raised the ground against serious allegations of corruption against the same Mukul Roy, who has now become a 'valuable member' of the BJP

 The National Congress Party (NCP) wants to field Shankar Singh Vaghela in Gujarat's Gandhinagar seat against Amit Shah
 haalanki gujarat main ensipi or congress ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa abhi tak nahin hua he
 But there are reports in the political circles that Shankar Singh Vaghela may be the candidate from the NCP against Amit Shah

 jab waghela gandhinagar seat bhaajapa ko dilaa sakate hai, to ensipi ko kyon nahingujarat ensipi ne waghela ko amit shah ke saamne utaarne kii maang ko party alaakaman ke saamne rakhi he
 The NCP believes that in 1989, when no one knew the BJP on the Gandhinagar seat, Shankar Singh Vaghela had put this seat in the bjp's seat
 to is baar vah yah seat ensipi ko bhi dilaa sakate hai
 Vaghela left this seat for Advani in 1991
 iske baad se is par bhaajapa kaa kabja rahaa he
 The Thakor community will get votes in Gandhinagar, Shankar Singh Vaghela Gandhinagar has 7 assembly seats in the Lok Sabha constituency

 Vaghela had already said that he will not contest this time, Sheshankar Singh Vaghela has already announced that he will not contest the Lok Sabha election this time
 aisi khabar he ki ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar agar shankar singh waghela ko manaaen to vah chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar ho sakate hai

 - input bhashaa se There has been an increase in the incidence of smartphone burst since last month
 samsung kaa flagship Galaxy Note7 ho yaa phir Galaxy S7 Edge
 In addition to these two smartphones in recent times, there have been reports of several smartphones bursting
 Galaxy Note7 to ek whical main aise fata jise dekhakar laga ki vahaan koi bam blast hua he
 However, Note7 is neither the first smartphone to have a battery problem nor is it after all
 is tarah ke problem pehle bhi aate rahe hai or tab tak ye maamle bane rahenge jabatak smartphone main Lithium-ion cell lagaae jate rahenge
 Most cases of smartphone burst occur during charging
 lekin haalia ghatnaon se lagata he ki ye kabhi bhi fat sakate hai
 Experts believe that most such cases are due to batteries
 jaaniye kyon fatate hai smartfonsasmartfones main lagi Lithium betry amuman in do vajahon se fatati he- garm ho kar or damege hone par
 In case of battery over heat, most of the cases come due to battery heating and bursting
 charging circuit or input power main kuch folt hone se aisa hota he
 It keeps charging even when the battery is hot and does not get cold and bursts or melts
 aise main yujar kaa haath jal saktaa he yaa jahaan par phone rakhaa he wo jagah bhi jal sakati he
 The specialty of Physical Damage Lithium Batteries is that they are soluble, they can be charged easily and give high output
 jaahir he ye halki hai to iskaa parat or electrode ko alag karne vaali parat bhi kaaphi kamjor hoti he
 If it falls from a height, then there is a risk of short circuit and if shot circuit occurs, bursting is inevitable
 galat charger or betry ke istemaal seagar aap apane phone ke liye kisi duusare smartphone kaa charger yuj kar rahe hai to isse aapaki betry zyada garm hogi or iskaa protection circuit damege ho saktaa he
 If you have bought a third party battery then it can also cause trouble

 Audiences around the world on Netflix and Amazon are liking crime-zone content
 bharat main bhi web siries kaa jamkar bolbalaa he
 This medium has opened up new doors of success for Indian creators
 krime or duusari alag-alag kahaniyon par haal hi main kai siries aa chuki hai
 Amazon's series "mirzapur" is also debated in this episode
 kuch bhartiya web siries ko kaaphi saraahaa bhi gaya
 Especially Netflix's Sacred Games, which influenced audiences around the world
 mirzapur main masterbation seen, shweta boleen- coffee pine jitna sahajaweb siries popular kyon ?darasal, sensor na hone kii vajah se is madhyam main kahaniyon ko kehane kaa spes mil rahaa he
 Because of this, all the things that used to be censored in films till now are easily shown here with cinematic liberty
 moulikta main chizon ko hoobahoo dikhaane-dekhne kaa yah andaaj bhartiya darshakon ke liye bilkul nayaa he
 This is not possible in films and TV because of censor rules
 gaur karen to bhartiya web siries main krime, sex or vaayalence kaa cocktail khub bikta dikh rahaa he
 Roasting this cocktail in various series like Sacred Games, Breath, Lust Stories, Inside Age, Love Lust and Confusion, tried to impress the audience
 inhen khub dekha ja rahaa he
 But the truth is that there have been many controversies about such content and people have even demanded a ban on it
 secred genms ke baad "mirzapur" main is cocktail ko jamkar bhunaane kii koshish hui he
 The uncensored scenes of violence in Mirzapur are terrifying
 atadiyon kaa baahar nikal aana, goli se bheje ko udaana, sadak par khun bahna or screen par maance ke lothede ko bikharate dekhnaa, bahut daraavna he, lekin bilkul alag tarah kaa romaanchak anubhav bhi
 Similarly, freedom is being seen in web series about uncensored sexual scenes
 ye duusari baat he ki tamaam kahaniyon main inkaa dikhaaya janaa kitna jaruri or arthpurna he? mirzapur main bhi sex or vaayalence ko lekar aise bahut saare seen hai jin par vivaad ho saktaa he
 The methods of the killings in the web series are frightening
 kai baar krurta dikhaane ke liye aise drishyon kaa istemaal bematlab najar aata he
 Like the carpet brother's son, Munna Tripathi, repeatedly taunting Radhia
 gajagamini kaa masterbation vaala seen
 How accurate is it to be shown? While the helpless father-in-law "rapes" his feet by blackmailing Kalina Bhaiya's second wife Bina Tripathi, this is a very amazing scene in the series
 isamen tamaam chijen na dikhaakar bhi bahut kuch kah diya gaya he
 There is a secret package in Mirzapur Kulbhushan Kharbanda's acting, these 6 characters are heavy to be remembered? Right now the filmmakers in India have a lot of leeway for censorship on web series
 unhen is chhot kii maryaada or had ko nirdhaarit karnaa padegaa
 Because after Sacred Games and Lust Stories the way a faction is seeking to create a system to monitor it, there will be fundamental creativity affected by censorship
 bematlab kii hinsa or yon drishyon ko dikhaane kii andhi res se bachane kaa rasta nikaalnaa jaruri he
 While filming scenes of sex and violence, it is important to keep in mind that such scenes remain meaningful according to the mood of the story
 moulikta ke naam par bhedchaal hui to ye madhyam bhi sankatagrast ho jayega

 - When it comes to strengthening india-africa relations, it also has the concern of the world
 - jab apni dharti ke logon ko pidaa hoti he to aap bhi jarur sochate honge
 You must also be pained - the government runs a foreign department
 jo sochataa he ki duniya bharat se jude
 - The true ambassadors of India are Indians spread across the world
 duniya ko jodne kii takat bharatiyon main hi he
 Earlier, PM Modi said on Twitter, 'hello Kenya! This friendly country was delighted to come, with which India has a historically close relationship
 'iske pehle pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne saal 1981 main kenya kii yatra kii thi
 This is the first visit of an Indian Prime Minister to this country during these 35 years after him

 Janata dal-u national general secretary and spokesperson KC Tyagi has written a letter to former party president Sharad Yadav saying that reading the statement of your participation in the RJD rally in newspapers was surprising and sad because RJD organized this rally To cover the corruption of the people of his family
 unhone kaha is raily main aapaki upasthiti se nishchit hoga ki aapane na sirf ucch aadarshon or siddhanton ke khilaaf aacharan kiya he balki swechha se jadyu kaa tyaag bhi kar diya he
 Sadly, you continued to conduct parallel anti-party activities in Patna itself and you did not consider the platform of the party to be the appropriate platform to speak
 aise main aashaa he ki aap niti, siddhant or aadarshon ko praathamikta dete hue bhrashtachar bachaane ke naam par yojit argedy kii raily main shaamil hone se parhez karenge

 Another trend of Bollywood has emerged in the last few years, in which more than one great trailer is released before the release of a film, and sometimes these trailers are more preferred than the whole film

 Titled 'akhilesh Returns', i
e
 'akhilesh 2', the trailer is trending right now, and is based entirely on Bollywood king Shah Rukh Khan's 'don 2'
 
 
 trailor main siem sahab 11 march ko apni zordaar vaapasi kaa elaan karte nazar aa rahe hai, jo darasal matganana kaa din he
 
 
 The reason for liking this video is that this video posted on 15 February so far has about 1
 90 lakh baar dekha ja chukaa he
 
 
 In this video of less than two minutes, Akhilesh Yadav's interview, clips of speeches are taken and Shahrukh Khan's dialogues are pasted on him

 At the end of the video, Akhilesh Yadav says, "I thought, go and do some good work, but you guys didn't give me a chance to change
" 
 
 " The video, featuring Akhilesh Yadav as a Bollywood action star, also has a line about demonetisation, and in addition to high-speed car chases, and jumping from planes, like any Hindi masala film
 
 
 khayr, ham aapako iske bare main bahut zyaada bataakar aapkaa mazaa kirkira nahin karnaa chaahate, so, aap khud hi dekh lijie yah video

 In the trailer, CM Sahab is seen announcing his strong comeback on March 11, which is actually counting day
 
 
 is video ko pasand kiye jane kaa alam yah he ki 15 farvari ko post kiye gaye is video ko ab tak lagbhag 1
 It has been viewed 90 million times
 
 
 do minute se bhi kam avadhi ke is video main akhilesh yadav ke intervyuu, bhaashanon kii clip lekar un par shahrukh khan ke dialog chipkaae gaye hai
 
 
 Apart from these, in this trailer, the voice of the character Roma played by Priyanka Chopra has acquired the voice of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seen in the role of Vishal Malik, a police officer played by the late actor Om Puri

 Maihar, famous for a temple in the Satna district at the foothills of the Kaimur Hills, was an interesting alternative to the party's campaign campaign for Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath
 unhone november main sambhavit vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye 1 agast se yahaan se prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 It was from this city that Kamal Nath started campaigning in 1998, when the Congress emerged victorious after overcoming all odds
 sharada mata mandir main darshan ke baad usee daur ko yaad karte hue kamalnath ne jansabha main badi sankhya main jute logon se kaha, "1998 main jab maine maihar se prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii thi, to sharada mata ne congress ko jeet kaa aashirwad diya tha
 Now there is no but, Congress will win in the upcoming assembly elections as well
 ''nauveen baar loksabhaa saansad bane kamalnath ko rajya main jad jamaa chuki (15 saal se satta main) bhaajapa se mukaable ke liye apane ab tak ke anubhavon se hasil sari rajnatik sooyeeboojh kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 And what better way to do this than to beat Vireidhi with his own tricks in the game? At a public meeting in Ganj Basoda, Vidisha on 2 September, Kamal Nath promised that if the Congress came to power, a gaushala would be set up in every gram panchayat
 unhone kaha, "bhaajapa goraksha kii baat karti he par usne kiya kuch nahin
 Cows are dying on the streets every day
 '' nai jimmedaari milane ke chaar maheene ke bheetar kamalnath ne sanghathan ko majboot karne ke saath shuruyaat kii, jo ki bhaajapa kii mukhya takat he
 Out of 63 District Congress Committee (DCC), 31 heads were removed who were inactive or "causing problems"
 '' baaki ko saaf kah diya gaya he ki ve ummidavaaron kaa samarthan karen
 Kamal Nath has understood that block level leaders will have a very important role in mobilizing support for the party before and during the election as well, hence they have divided the 11 administrative blocks of their Lok Sabha constituency Chhindwara into 120 units
 haalanki samay kam hone kii vajah se ve ise madhya pradesh ke sabhi 487 block main lagu nahin kar sakate
 Taking lessons from the experiences of Kerala, two new organizational levels - Mandalam and Sector have been created
 congress ke kai sakriy vidhayakon or jila cameti pramukhon ne bharosa diya he ki chunaav ke din har booth par smartphone se las kam se kam ek kaaryakarta or anya 10 kaaryakarta party kii aankh-kaan kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 The Congress has learned one more thing from the bookkeeping of the BJP - meeting representatives from different communities
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh c1haan kii panchayaton kii tarah, jinako samudaay or peshey ke mutabik sangathit kiya gaya he, kamalnath vibhinn samudaayon ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 In a similar effort, on August 28, he met representatives of the Kushwaha community
 pichley chaar maheenon main kamalnath ne yadav, gurjar, bohari, vaisya, lodhi, sindhi, patidaar, banjaaraa or balaai samudaay ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kii he
 He has promised that if the Congress party comes to power, all the grievances of these communities will be resolved and their interests will be protected
 unke mahaj 100 din ke netritv main bhopal sthit congress mukhyalay main nattejey dikhne lage hai
 Kamal Nath has implemented a semi-corporate style methodology in the Pradesh Congress Committee
 kaaryakramon or dauron kii yojana, sakht samay-saarini, suchi or appointment aadi ke bare main chapa hua vivaran maujuud he
 Kamal Nath spent an unprecedented 20 days in Bhopal, meeting ticket claimants and party officials and analyzing the constituencies
 tikaton ke daavedaaron se poocha gaya ki unki jeetne kii ranneeti kya hogi
 Kamal Nath himself spoke to the people to gauge their merit, while his office provided details of ticket seekers and their constituencies
 unhone jansabhaon kii shuruyaat bhi kar di he, haalanki prachaar abhiyaan kii vidhivat shuruyaat rahul gandhi ke sitambar main hone vaale road sho se hogi
 The show is not divided according to the area of influence of the leaders of Madhya Pradesh State Congress
 gwalior-chambal kshetra main jyotiraditya sindhiya, mahakaushal main kamalnath, malwa, nimad or bundelkhand main digvijay singh or baghelkhand main netaa vipaksh ajay singh kaa asar he
 Earlier, only those who had allegiance to these leaders got tickets
 lekin party sutron kii maane to yah formula ab nahin chalegaa
 The Congress is relying largely on several surveys conducted by agencies, as was done in Gujarat and Karnataka
 is baar survey kaa sample sies har vidhansabha main 5,000 voters se badhaakar 15,000 kar diya gaya he, taaki zyada sateek akalan ho sake
 Based on the survey results, it will be decided who will be the final candidate, not loyalty to any leader
 congress kii yojana bhaajapa se pehle hi tikat vitarit karne kii he
 In the 50 seats where the party has not won in the last five elections, the candidates can be announced only in mid-september, which will be a record for the party
 shivaraj-bhaajapa, donon par nishanasal 2013 tak madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh c1haan congress ke hamale kaa mukhya nishaanaa the
 It was being tried to tarnish his image by raising the issues of Vyapam and Dumper scams and highlight the alleged involvement of his family members in illegal sand mining
 lekin centre or rajya kii jaanch agenciyaan jab chouhan ke khilaaf kuch nahin nikaal sakin, to is ranneeti se milane vaala phayda simit hone laga
 This time the Congress has changed the way and it is preparing for joint attack on Chauhan and BJP
 prashasnic morche kii vifaltaaon ke liye jahaan chaihaan par hamalaa kiya jayega, vahiin sarkaar ke nichle str par bhrashtachar ke liye bhaajapa par aarope lagaae jaaenge
 Further, in line with Kamal Nath's goal of localizing the elections, the Congress plans to take up legislative issues and publicize local scandals so as to divert attention from Chauhan and also wrap up existing BJP mlas
 digvijay factompani jan aashirwad yatra ke dauraan chaihaan lagaataar digvijay singh par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai or logon ko yaad dilaa rahe hai ki 1993 se 2003 ke bich kii unki satta ke dauraan kathith rup se rajya kis tarah se badahaal tha
 It is a bit difficult for the Congress in this matter, as it cannot stand away from Digvijay
 unke aaj bhi congress sanghathan or vidhayakon main kaaphi vafaadaar hai
 Apart from this, a number of populist steps were also taken during Digvijay Singh's tenure, such as free electricity to farmers, bill waivers, etc
, which the Congress wants to take credit for
 haalanki party yah nahin chaahegi ki chunaav bhaajapa shashan banaam digvijay ke 10 saal ke shashan ke masale par ladaa jaae
 This is why Digvijay's emphasis is on working within the party
 unhone "ekta yatra'' nikaali thi, jisamen unhone congress ke sabhi guton ko saath laane kii koshish kii or vachan liya ki pehle ve bhaajapa ko baahar karne ke liye kaam karen, matbhed to baad main bhi sulajhaa liye jaaenge
 The Congress is preparing to use the slogan "chhindwara model" of development on the lines of Narendra Modi's "gujarat model" during its campaign
 congress ke netaa jansabhaon main jorshor se is baat ko uthaa rahe hai ki kis tarah se chhindwara se nau baar saansad bane kamalnath ne apane vijan se is adivasee jile ko audyogic rup se viksit or samrudh jile main badal diya
 Congress leaders are also reminding voters of Kamal Nath's association with the nehru-gandhi family, which was even called "the third son of Indira Gandhi"
 is tarah se nehru-gandhi parivaar ke prati aadar rakhane waalon ko jodgaye kii koshish kii ja rahi hai
 Strengthening of SP-BSP There is a lot of news in the Digamedia that the Congress is going to tie up with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), in many reports, the seats were also mentioned
 Coalition partners can be found
 lekin congress ke sheersh netaaon kaa kahana he ki abhi gathbandhan dur kii kaudi he
 The reason is being told that BSP supremo Mayawati has told the Congress leaders that they are the advisors of the alliance
 si
 Discuss with Egypt
 vaise bataaya jaataa he ki rahul gandhi ne gathbandhan par sahmati jataa di he, lekin yah party ko nuksaan kii keemat par nahin hoga
 The BSP is seeking most seats in areas where Jyotiraditya Scindia has influence, such as Ambah, Dimani (which the BSP won in 2013), Sheopur, Sumauli, Morena, Bhind (on which the BSP stood second)
 
 vah kuch siten un ilaakon main maang rahi he jo ajay singh ke garh maane jate hai, jaise-mangwan, raigaanv (jinamein basapa ko jeet mili thi) or rampur baghelan, semaria, devatalab or reva (jahaan vah duusare sthaan par thi)
 These two leaders will not be very excited at the prospect of alliance, as they will lose these seats
 aage kii chunautiyancongress kii reliyon main to baari bheed dikh rahi he, lekin party main bhitari ghamaasan ab bhi ek chunauti he
 In July, AICC Secretary General Deepak Babaria was allegedly abused by Congress workers in Rewa after he did not name Ajay Singh as one of the possible contenders for the Chief Minister
 rahul ne is masale ko dilli main congress ke sheersh netaaon ke bich uthaaya or iske baad pisisi ne chah kaaryakartaaon ko nikaal diya
 There have been many such incidents
 baharhaal, pahari ke neeche maihar main sharada mata mandir ke paas hi ek akhaada he, jahaan janashrutiyon ke mutabik, madhyakaal ke prasiddh yoddha aalha or oodal kushti ke daanv aajamaaya karte the
 Both the brothers had fought the valiant ruler Prithviraj Chauhan in a battle, his Chandel army could not win but it had hurt Chauhan a lot
 madhya pradesh kaa rajnatik akhaada bhi apane ko isi tarah ke aitihaasik chunavi jang ke liye taiyaar kar rahaa he
 An army involved in this war is again headed by a Chahan
 kya aadhunik yug main chunauti dene vaale yoddha isi itihaas gati ko praapt honge? ise jaanane ke liye aapako november tak intjaar karnaa hoga

 He said, 'I think there are very beautiful models like Kamal Sidhu and Lakshmi in our country
 ' isha kii tasviir 2010 ke kingfisher swimasoot calendar main chhapi thi
 He said that foreigners find our models beautiful and different
 unhone kaha ki purvottar se lekar dakshin bharat tak hamaari modells kii apni ek alag pahchaan or khubsuurati he
 Isha made her film debut this year with Mahesh Bhatt's film Jannat-2, which also featured Emraan Hashmi and Randeep Hooda

 Amid concerns over its efforts to increase influence in South Asia, China has called India its 'rival partner' and has agreed to work with other SAARC countries, including it, to improve regional connectivity
 china kii up videsh mantri phu ing ne bhutan or nepal kii apni yatraaon se lautne ke baad kaha, ‘mere vichaar main china or bharat pratidwandvi nahin, balki saajhedaar hai
 In recent years, there has been strong progress in china-india relations for which the consent of the leaders of both countries should be thanked
 ’phu ing ne bhutan or nepal kii apni yatra ke dauraan in donon deshon ke netaaon ke saath gahan vaarta kii
 He outlined China's policy initiatives in South Asia in an interview with an official newspaper, saying that improving the relations with SAARC countries of this country would not affect other countries' interests
 bhutan or nepal ke saath bharat ke najdiki sambandhon ke sandarbh main kshetra main bharat or china ke bich ranneetik pratidwandvita ke bare main puche jane par phu ing ne kaha bhutan or nepal sahit dakshin asian deshon ke saath sambandh sudhaarney ke china ke prayaas kaa nishaanaa koi anya teesraa desh nahin he, naa hi isse anya deshon ke hit prabhavit honge
 Instead, it will only increase the prosperity of the region
 unhone kaha, ‘china kshetreey vikaas ko protsaahit karne ke liye bharat ke saath sahyog badhaane ko taiyaar he
 For example, if China, India and South Asian countries work together and benefit from strong development in the region itself, then the need for connectivity can be better met
 ’ aisa sambhavat: pehali baar he jab china ne swayan or dakshes deshon ke saath ‘sampark’ ke bare main baat kii he

 While the US assured them to lift the visa ban, China invited them to come
 ab is kadi main japan bhi jud gaya he jisane modi ke swaagat ke liye palken bicha di hai
 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo AB said in Singapore that he was ready to welcome Narendra Modi and would take steps to further strengthen the relationship in the two countries
 unhone singapore main is baat kaa sanket diya ki modi jaldi hi japan kaa daura karne vaale hai
 He also said that India, Japan and America together can set a new example of friendship
 teenon deshon main sambandhon ko gaharaa banane main japan ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaana chahta he
 AB wants a tripartite agreement between the three countries
 japani pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah narendra modi ke swaagat ke liye betaab hai jo ek nishpaksh chunaav main jitkar aae hai
 He said that India and Japan want to restore peace and law in Asia
 dhyaan rahe ki kai muddon par japan or china main matbhed he or japan chahta he ki bharat uskaa saath de
 Narendra Modi visited Japan during his Chief Ministership and has deep connections with the leaders there
 ab japan ko lag rahaa he ki vah unke saath milakar is kshetra main ek nai vyavastha kaayam kare
 On the other hand, the Prime Minister also has good relations with China and he also wants to take advantage of the opportunity so that India does not go too close to Japan or America

 Rahul tweeted that it was a great pleasure to have a press conference in Bengaluru today
 jin logon ke sawaal nahin le paae unase maafee chahta hum
 But, our Prime Minister has not held a single press conference in the last four years, but i will keep doing it

 rahul gandhi ne is dauraan bhartiya janata party or pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul Gandhi retaliated against the attack on his mother Sonia Gandhi for continuing to be Italian
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, '' meri maa italy se hai, lekin unhone apni jindagi kaa kaaphi hissaa bharat main bitaayaa he
 He is more Indian than many Indians
 rahul gandhi ne kaha, ''meri maa ne is desh ke liye balidaan diya he''
 He has suffered a lot for this country
 rahul bole, ''agar pradhanmantri meri maa ke bare main kuch coment karte hai, to vah unka str bataata he
 Big talk of Rahul Gandhi's press conference

 Sindhutai Sapkal will be seen at the hot seat in the first Karmaveer episode of this season of Kaun Banega Crorepati
 kebisi ke manch par isse pehle kai samajasevi aa chuke hai
 Wednesday's episode featured a short clip about Sindhutai
 ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai ki koun hai sindhutai jo is sijan ke pehle karmveer episod main najar aane vaali hai
 Sindhutai is a Marathi activist working for orphans
 maharashtra ke wardha jile ke pipari gaanv main janmin sindhutai ke pita ek charvaaha the or vah apane parivaar kii sabase naapsand bacchee thim
 He was called as chinthi (tattered cloth) in the house
 pita unhen padhaanaa chaahate the lekin maa virodh karti thim
 The father taught him against the mother's wish but due to household responsibilities he soon had to leave school
 10 saal kii umr main sindhutai kii shaadi 30 saal ke srihari sapkaal ke saath kar di gai
 Sindhutai's personal life has been full of problems and troubles
 unhone apana puraa jivan anaath bacchon ko samarpit kiya he
 That is why they are called mai or mother
 unhone kul 1050 bacchon ko god liya he or unke laalan paalan kaa kharch uthaa rahi hai
 Sindhutai has been awarded with a total of 276 awards, including the Ahilyabai Award, which has been conferred by the President
 wo sadakon par bheekh maangati taaki anaath bacchon kaa pet bhar sakensindhutai ke bare main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki jab vah 9 maheene kii pregnent thim tab unhen ghar se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Later, when her husband turned 80, he came to live in an orphanage in Sindhutai
 kaha jaataa he ki sindhutai ne unhen ek bete ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 All the social workers who have come on the show before, have heard emotional stories
 sindhutai ke episod main darshakon ko kaaphi kuch sunne ko milegaa
 The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad has banned tainted sadhus at Nashik Kumbh Snan
 yah roak do mahamandaleshwaron par aapraadhik aaropon ke chalate lagaai gai he
 Swami Sachchidananda and Radhe Maa have been banned from the Akhada Council
 They have been ordered to impose monasteries of Swami Sachchidanand, a monk, and Radhe Maa from Mumbai, both of them due to criminal charges, Swami Sachchidanand and Radhe Maa have been banned due to criminal charges
 The ban has been imposed due to the removal of criminal people who have entered among saints
 mahamandaleshwaron par ye he aropaswami sachchidanand urf sachin dutt par dhokhadhadi, jameen hadapney jaise kai aapraadhik cese hai, dutt noida main pita rajendra kumaar ke saath real state kaa bijness chalaata tha, jo baad mensadhuban gaya, vahiin radhe maa ke khilaaf mumbai ke kandivali police stesan main dahej pratadna or 6 logon ke saath dhokhadhadi ke cese darj hai
 When new love spreads, girls want to say a lot to their lover
 jitne bhi imoshans unke andar ghumdate hai, unako ve apane boyfriend se turant share karnaa chaahati hai
 But many times this honesty is also very heavy and instead of coming close to you, he starts finding excuses to run away from you
 to yaad rakhen ki ye chaar baaten aapako rishte kii shuruyaat main katai nahin kehani hai-tum mere eks kii tarah dikhte hokoi bhi ladkaa yah nahin sunanaa chahega ki aapkaa eks or vah ek jaise dikhte hai, unki aadaten milti hai aadi
 If you have liked him for this reason, then your relationship will not last and due to these things you may get away from you very soon
 tumhaare dost ke kapade tumse behatar hote hanaapaki sari tarif uske liye honi chahie or agar aap abhi se hi uske doston ko usase behatar bataaengi to apana rishta hi kamjor karengi
 Maybe he just smiles in front of you, but the feeling of security growing inside will cause problems for both of you
 tum hamaare bachche kaa naam kya rakhogemana ki aap us par fida hai lekin shaadi or bacchon ke bare main baat karne kii itani jaldi kya he
 Boys are often nervous about the name of marriage anyway and if you pressurize them in a hurry, then they will run away instead of coming close
 tumhaare dost mujhase bardaasht nahin hoteap use pasand hai, lekin aapke liye vah apane dost nahin chhodana chahega
 Even if you get irritated by seeing their habits, but keep quiet in this matter for the good of your relationship
 agar aap yah soch rahi hai ki jab or muddon par usase khulkar baat ho jaati he to is par kyon nahin, to hamaari baat note kar len ki aap apana relation khud hi kharaab karengi
