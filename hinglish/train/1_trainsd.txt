 Nigeria took vigilance and kept the ball in their possession in the first six minutes following Sigurdsson's attacks

 musa ne 49wein minute main victor mosej ke cross par acchhee tarah se niyantran jamaane ke baad shot jamaaya or heness halderson ke paas use rokane kaa koi mauka nahin tha
 Nigeria then played more aggressively

 Moses first overtook Kari Aronson with his quickness and skill, and then scored easily, hitting goalkeeper Haldersson

 He did not play in the previous match, but before that in his last World Cup match played in Brazil in 2014, he scored two goals against Argentina
 aam chunaav 2019 kaa bigul foonka ja chukaa he
 With the announcement of election dates, the code of conduct has come into force in the country and the countdown of the new government is going on
 ye chunaav behad hi khaas hone vaala he, ek taraf narendra modi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party dobaaraa satta main aane kii koshish kar rahi he
 So the Congress will try to come back to power under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kai mudde hai jinako lekar paksh-vipaksh aamane saamne hai or jo loksabhaa chunaav kii dasha-disha tay kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, there are many such challenges before the bjp-congress, which they have to face in the coming 70 days
 kya hai sabase bade mudde1
 The issue of national security is at its peak after the Pulpwama terror attack
 ek taraf bhaajapa kah rahi he ki unhone pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya he or unke kaarykaal main ek baar sargical strike or ek baar airstrike kii gai he
 So the Congress is also an attacker on this issue and is accusing the Modi government of scam in the Rafale deal
 congress kaa aarope he ki modi sarkaar ne rashtriya suraksha ko taak par rakh apane sahyogiyon ko phayda pahunchaaya
 2
 anndaata ke saath koun?2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa vaada lekar satta main ai modi sarkaar ne chunaav se ain pehle kisaanon ko package kaa elaan kiya
 Under the new scheme, 6000 rupees are being given annually to the account of small farmers, on which the BJP is thrashing
 to vahiin congress bhi lagaataar kisaanon kii badahaali kaa mudda uthaa rahi he or aarope laga rahi he ki beete 5 saal main kisaanon kii khudakushi ke maamle main badhotaree hui he

 abaki baar, rojgaar par raar!bijepi kii ore se arthvyavastha ke masale par jiesti or notebandi ke mudde ko frontroot par rakh kar aage badha ja rahaa he, to vahiin congress party rojgaar ke aankadon par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gher rahi he
 The Congress alleges that it is failing in the BJP which promised 2 crore jobs every year
 4
 Failure of schemes versus dynasty! BJP has been besieging the Congress for a long time on the issue of familism, whether Rahul Gandhi is going to be president or Priyanka Gandhi's recent entry into politics
 har baar bijepi kii ore se congress par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 At the same time, the Congress is also trying to surround the government on the failures of their schemes, the biggest issue in this is that of Make in India
 iske alaava bhi kisaan, dalit, mahila suraksha aadi ko lekar bhi nishaanaa sadhana jari he
 5
 jati par chhid gai raar!congress kii ore se lagaataar aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he ki modi sarkaar ke raaj main daliton par atyaachaar badha he
 Be it the Una incident or the Rohit Vemula case, the violence during the Bharat Bandh on April 2 last year is also included
 to vahiin bijepi kii ore se aarthik aadhaar par die gaye aarakshan par bhi dam thoka ja rahaa he, bijepi ko bharosa he ki unke is daanv se savarna voter unke paksh main vot denge

 Apart from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, other Hindu organizations including the VHP are aggressive about the construction of the Ram temple, on the other hand, the Congress has also moved towards soft Hindutva in the last few elections
 rahul gandhi gujarat, karnataka, rajasthan or madhyapradesh samet kai vidhansabha chunaav main mandir-mandir maathaa tekte hue najar aae hai

 com / qfiodidohr — ANI (@ani_news) September 18, 2015 agar aap aksar hawaii yatra karte hai to yah khabar aapke liye he
 a Saudi airline has banned entry of passengers who want to travel by air in short clothing, sleeveless clothes or tight clothes
 yun kahen ki jis yatri kii khuli bahen or pair najar aa rahe hai, unhen is airlines main yatra karne kaa mauka nahin milegaa
 Not only this, airlines have also banned men wearing shorts
 saudi airlines ne haal hi main yah dress code jari kiya he
 These natural contraceptives are a million times better than pils
according to the airlines, during the journey, the clothes of the passengers should be such that the passenger sitting next to them does not get upset or hurt his feelings
 isliye khaastaur se mahilaon ko hawaii yatra ke dauraan aise kapade nahin pahananaa chahie, jisamen unki khuli bahen or taange dikhen
 Even women traveling in tight and transparent clothes is prohibited
 in niyamon kaa paalan na karne vaale yatriyon kii tikat radd kii ja sakati he
 The most surprising thing is that these rules of airlines also apply to foreign passengers
 bataa den ki saudi main mahilaon ke paridhaan ko lekar kai kade niyam hai
 For example, in public places they have to wear loose-fitting clothes and have their head covered
 kudarat se khilwaad
 
 
 The This child is not only a parent, but a third also had a similar case with United Airlines in March before Sasaudi Airlines, in which two girls were stopped from traveling just because they wore tight clothes
 
 airlines kaa kahana tha ki use yah tay karne kaa adhikaar he ki yatriyon ne uchit kapade pahan rakhe hon
 If it is not so, it can cancel the passenger ticket

 Modi said in the Chief Ministers Conference that the fight against terrorism requires a clear vision and strong political will
 iske liye ranneeti ko antim rup dene ke liye gambhir najariya chahie
 He said that we will not be able to achieve the expected target due to the efforts made in part
 purv ke prayaason or karravaayiyon kii vyapak samiksha kiye bina ham agenciyon or sanghathanon kaa gathan to kar denge, lekin ve apana uddeshy hasil karne main vifal rahengi
 Modi accused the Center of altering the relationship between the Center and the state under the Constitution and changing well-defined boundaries
 saath hi kaha ki haal ke kuch ghatnakram sangheey dhaanche ke khilaaf jate hai, masalan railway suraksha bal kanoon, biguef kanoon main sanshodhan
 He urged the Center to follow the current political realities and change its way of thinking to gain political space through the governmental order of twisting

 Australia captain Steve Smith, who has completed the journey from leg-spinner in international cricket to a batsman scoring a century in the World Cup 2015 semi-finals, feels before his 100th ODI match that he has matured for international level matches
 smith ne kaha, ‘‘ mujhe lagata he ki main white ball player (limited overs player) ke rup main ubhara hum

 P
 je
 i called him at Abdul Kalam's office to tell him that i had come back to India Today and that we were planning a conclave where he would like to address him
 kalam ne vaada kiya ki ve is hafte mujhase milenge
 Sadly, this could not happen
 main jaanata hum ki ve mujhase milte hi apni natkhat muskaan ke saath abhivadan karte or kehete, ''kya, tumne dobaaraa apni canfigareshan badal lee!''mujhe unke jivan ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhane kaa saubhaahgya mila tha
 While doing this, the most shocking thing about Kalam to me was that he always found a positive side even in adverse circumstances
 kalam mandiron ke shahar rameswaram main ek musalmaan parivaar main paidaa hue the, jahaan unke pita maanjhi the or unhen kaaphi kattarta jhelni padati thi
 At school, when he sat next to a Brahmin boy, his teacher got angry and forced him out of the classroom
 maine jab kalam se unke ehsaas ke bare main poocha, to unhen sirf acchhee chijen yaad thim
 He was moistened after telling how another Brahmin from the village heard this incident, and he invited him to his house to eat and ordered his bashful wife to serve him food
 jab unki naav ek tufaan main nasht ho gai, tab unki bahan ne apane gahane girvee rakhkar unhen ejineering main diploma karwaane ke liye madras institute of technology main padhgaye bheja tha
 His professor
 e
 V
 pandlai yaad karte hai ki vaise to kalam ke sarvshereshth rahane ke koi pratyaksh sanket nahin the, phir bhi ve jo paanaa chaahate the, uske liye kisi bhi baadha se takaraane kaa kalejaa rakhte the
 Kalam was very hardworking
 saaf goi, sankalp, mehnat or vinamrata jaise gunon ne unhen asambhav ko sambhav karne main madad kii
 Kalam told me that he wished to become a fighter pilot and was disappointed when he failed an Air Force interview
 tabhi unhone tay kiya tha ki agar ve ud nahin sake to kya hua, ve udaye vaali mashine banaaenge
 He was recruited as a junior scientist
 phir unki badali bangaluru ke aronotical deveopment divijan main ho gai
 He designed the indigenous hovercraft on his own, and among those who were impressed by seeing it, M
 ji
 K
 menon bhi the
 He recommended Kalam to Vikram Sarabhai, who was planning India's space program at the time
 bharat ke shuruaati rocket ko nirmit or prakshepit karne main safaltaapurvak madad karke kalam jald hi sarabhai ke chahete ban gaye
 Sarabhai's successor Satish Dhawan, however, nurtured Kalam's abilities as a team manager and made him the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle SLV3
 videsh se doctoret kii oopaadhi hasil kiye unke kai sahakarmiyon ko yah baat buree lagi ki ejineering main diplomadhari ko unke upar baitha diya gaya he
 He tried his best to fill the inferiority complex in Kalam, but it was not possible to humiliate young Kalam so easily
 kalam ne mujhe bataaya tha ki unhone idhar ke varshon ko apane nirnaayak dinon ke taur par dekha or maargdarshan ke liye sarvshereshth shikshak unhen uplabdh the
 He learned from Sarabhai what the importance of vision is
 dhawan se unhone janaa ki drushti ko mishan main kaise tabdeel kiya jaataa he or trutiheen pranaliyaan kaise viksit kii jaati hai
 He learned from the soft-spoken Brahmaprakash, the first director of the Space Center, how a mission can be transformed into achievable goals
 in sab ne milakar kalam ko praudyogiki kaa ek shandaar prabandhak banaaya, jo durlabh kism kaa tha
 The important thing was that the teachers of Kalam taught them how to overcome failures
 eselvi3 kaa pehla prakshepan 1979 main kiya gaya tha jo bengal kii khadi main ja gira
 Dhawan took the responsibility of this on his shoulders
 kalam ko bachaa liya jo istipha dena chaahate the
 Dhawan then taught Kalam how to ensure a rigorous quality control system
 saal bhar baad eselvi3 kaa safal prakshepan kiya gaya jisaki vajah se upgrah prakshepan ke maamle main bharat chhathvaan raashtra ban gaya
 Dhawan retreated quietly and gave the credit to Kalam
 kalam ne bataaya ki prakshepan ke baad unhen bechaini mahasoos hone lagi
 They wanted to meet new challenges
 tatkaaleen raksha mantri ke vaigyanik salaahkaar parmaanu vaigyanik raja ramanna kisi aise shaks kii talash main the jo maranasann raksha anusandhan or vikaas prayogshaala (diardl) main jaan phoonk sake or parmaanu hathiyaaron ke vahan ke liye misile bana sake
 When he came to know that Kalam was in search of some new work, he gave all his strength to give him the command of this laboratory
 aisa pehali baar tha jab sheersh antariksh vaigyanik raksha pariyojna kii kaman sambhaal rahaa tha
 i asked Kalam why when he was so focused on building Aman vehicles under the space program, why did he choose to build war weapons
 kalam ne jawaab diya, ''mujhe koi dikkat nahin thi or donon ke bich koi takaraav nahin dikhataa tha
 By making such a stock of war, i was really ensuring peace for my country
 ab koi bhi desh ham par hamalaa karne kaa dussahas nahin karata
 i am making weapons of peace
 '' yahi dilachasp virodhalankar baad main jaakar bharat ke parmaanu or missile itihaas par likhi meri kitaab kaa sheershak bana
 Kalam, with his hippie hair and worn slippers, soon revived the DRDL, which at the time was producing Agni and Prithvi missiles
 ve lakshya tay karte the, prayoktaaon kii maujuudagi main kathin samikshaayen karte the or apni vishisht style main nattejey praapt karne ke liye vaigyanikon ko prerit karte the
 Kalam told me that he always came fully prepared for the meeting and summoned the answer with generous discipline from whomever he had assigned any work to
 unke ek sahyogi ranga raav kehete hai, ''aapako mahasoos hi nahin hota ki ve aapke bos hai
 It was as if they already existed
 '' ve log kalam ko pitatulya maanate the
 Kalam's style has never been confrontational and his patience was huge
 apane faislon ko thopane kii bajaae ve hameshaa aam sahmati banane kii ore kaam karte the
 They were rarely uprooted
 agar koi unhen niraash karata to ve bas itnaa kehteh phani gaai, yaa phir, ye hero koun he? kabhi ve kehete us mashhoor mechanic ko mere paas bhejo
 When no country was ready to sell missile technology to India, Kalam targeted self-reliance and developed all important technologies in a native manner
 diardl main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kalam nideshak ke bangale main rahane nahin gaye or sirf ek kamare main guest house main tike rahe
 He kept awake until after midnight and reviewed the progress of the project
 (maine unase jitne saakshaatkaar liye, adhiktar raat dedh baje ke baad ke hai jab ve khaali hote the)
 Its fruit was also received
 bharat ke itihaas main ek vaigyanik sanstha ke shandaar kayapalat kaa shrey kalam ko jaataa he
 By the mid-nineties, short-range nuclear-capable ballistic missiles Prithvi and long-range nuclear missile Agni had validated
 india today ne 1994 main unhen missile main kaa naam diya
 This name became his permanent identity
 us samay kalam ne mujhe bataaya tha, bharat ab missile power he jo kisi bhi samay or kahin bhi mixilon kii shrunkhlaa taiyaar kar saktaa he
 No restriction can scare us
 ek aalochana yah thi ki kalam kaa bas naam chamak rahaa he jabaki unki vaigyanik kshamtaaon par sawaal uthaae gaye the
 Taking such criticisms generously, Kalam used to say, "I was just a part of the success of the missile team"
 He gave me the freedom to talk in private with all my directors
 unhone meri pandulipi ko dekhne kaa kabhi aagrah nahin kiya or mazaakia lahaze main poocha, "mujhe ummid he ki tum mujhe mushkil main nahin daloge" maine unase kaha, "meraa bharosa rakhen, main nishpaksh rahoonga" unhone kabhi bhi shikaayat nahin kii
 Kalam's success made him the scientific advisor to the defense minister and made him director general of DRDO
 ve lutiuns dilli main kendriya sachiv str ke ek bangale ke adhikari the, phir bhi ve diardio ke guest house main ek kamare main hi tike rahe or apni puraani jeevanstyli ko unhone choda nahin
 One of the tasks Kalam was entrusted with was to develop India's nuclear war reserve along with top scientists of the Atomic Energy Commission
 tab tak kalam ke avivaahit rahane ke bare main yah jumala chalane laga tha ki bharat kii nai urja ke peeche bachaler kii takat he
 i had asked Kalam why he had never married and he smilingly said, "our family was very large so one among us could live without a child
" maine brahmacharee banane kaa faisla kiya!"jab aai
 K
 gujral pradhanmantri bane to unhone kalam ke kaam or saadagi bhari jeevanstyli kii saraahna karte hue unhen bhartiya vigyaan kaa sadhu qaraar diya
 It was the government of Gujral who awarded Kalam the Bharat Ratna
 isse pehle vipaksh ne, khaskar bijepi ne gujral kii kaaphi aalochana kii thi ki ve bharat kii suraksha ke liye paryaapt kaam nahin kar rahe the
 By honoring Kalam, Gujral had won on many fronts, "I wanted to give a powerful message not only to my country but to the whole world that how much India values its security
" yah sandesh unke liye bhi tha jo musalamaanon par bharosa nahin karte hai
 i have given Kalam the Bharat Ratna and closed his mouth
 ''gujral ke baad pradhanmantri bane atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi kalam se utane hi prabhavit the
 In May 1998, within a few months of coming to power for the second time, Vajpayee ordered five nuclear tests and declared India a nuclear weapon state
 pareekshanon ko dekhne ke baad pokaran main maujuud kalam shairana ho gaye
 He told me, "when we shook the earth and it passed below our feet, i was delighted
 mujhe yah bhi laga ki hamane parmaanu sattaaon ke varchasv ko tod diya he
 Now our country with a population of one billion, no one can say what we have to do
 hamen jo karnaa he, vah khud ham tay karenge
 Kalam retired from the DRDO in 1999 and planned to devote the rest of his life to academic initiatives, but destiny was somewhat more accepted
 bijepi ke netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar ne 2002 main unhen raashtrapati pad ke liye chunaa jisaki aanshik vajah unka muslim hona tha
 This was appropriate for the ruling party, as it could testify to its secularism
 maine jab unhen bataaya ki bahut se log aisa kah rahe hai ki unhen unke dharm kii vajah se raashtrapati banaaya gaya he, to unhone jawaab diya, ''vaaki? eemaandaaree se kahuun to maine is tarah se kabhi sochaa hi nahin
 i have always considered myself Indian
 ''yah vidambnaa hi kahi jaaegi ki jis shaks ne jindagi bhar ek kamare main jivan bitaayaa, vah ab desh ke sabase bade awaas main rahane ja rahaa tha
 When i told them that they would now have to wear formal clothes and host a meal, they said, "it will be a new experience for me, but you can do a lot of work while eating
" ''kalam kaa yogadan kya tha? apni pustak leading mindsah ain anatomi of leadership main harvard gardenar ne doordarshee netaa ke bare main likhaa he ki vah aisa shaks hota he ''jo kisi maujuuda kahani se judye main yaa phir sudur yaa haalia ateet kii kisi daastaan ko jinda karne main santosh nahin paata
 Such a person actually creates a new story, one that most people do not already know, and manages to achieve this story to an extent in an effective way
 ''meraa maananaa he ki kalam aise hi netaa the
 His life was an extraordinary narrative in itself
 ek maamuli maanjhi kaa betaa jisane bhedbhaav or garibi kii diwaar ko laanghte hue pehle sheersh vaigyanikon kii qatari main apni jagah banaai or phir bharat ko antariksh, missile or parmaanu takat banane main ahm yogadan diya
 He was then elected to the highest post in the country where he earned the identity of being "the President of the people" by his ease and humility
 in sab ne milakar awul pakir jainulabdin abdul kalam ko sachcha bhartiya nayak banaaya he
 During a meeting with US President Barack Obama, the organization strongly criticized the Pakistani Prime Minister for promising to take action against the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba
 aatankwaadi sanghathan ke pravaktaa abdulla gaznavi ne email se jari ek bayaan main kaha, 'pradhanmantri navaj sharif kaa sanghathan ke khilaaf karrwai kaa vaada nai dilli ko khush karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 He said that Sharif's statement 'has hurt the sentiments of Kashmiri Muslims' and this statement will have a wide impact in the state
 usne kaha, 'sharif kii karrwai ko kashmiriyon ke swatatranta sangharsh ke liye sahi or phydemand nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Sharif promised action against all terrorist networks, including lashkar-e-taiba, in a joint statement issued after his talks with Obama yesterday

 sanyukt raashtra ke baan kii moon ne aagaah kiya he ki nai bastiyaan basaane kii israel kii yojana se philstin ke saath shanti kii sambhaavna ko ‘karaara jhatka’ lag saktaa he
 The comments israel ne kareeb teen hajaar yahudee bastiyaan basaane kaa elaan kiya he, haalanki usne sthaan ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya he
 Media reports said that the new construction will also take place in the 'E-1' area of the west coast
 moon ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, purvi jerusalem or west bank main israel kii ore se nai bastiyaan basaane ke elaan se sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv ne gahari chintaa or niraashaa jataai he
 He said, settling settlements is illegal under international law

 The roar of the Shiv Sena bearing the roaring lion's logo (insignia) is rarely heard these days
 rashtriya falak par narendra modi ke udai se pehle raajnneeti main shivasena kii jo dhamak hua karti thi wo ab kahin kam najar aati he
 In the last 5 years, Shiv Sena's role in Maharashtra politics has become more like 'younger brother' than 'elder brother'
 sansthaapak bal thakare ke daur main khud ko number van hone kaa ehsaas karaane vaali shivasena aaj apana 53waan sthapana diwas manaa rahi he
 On June 19, 1966, keeping in mind the Maratha identity, the foundation of Shiv Sena was laid by Bala Saheb Thackeray to fight for the rights of the local people of Maharashtra
 shivasena kii pahchaan hinduvadi raajnneetik dal ke rup main he
 Bal Thackeray, who laid the foundation of politics Shiv Sena in the name of Marathi Manush, was originally a cartoonist and made sharp comments on political topics through a weekly political magazine named 'marmik', as well as voicing the rights of the people of Maratha society
 
 bataur cartoonist apaar kamyaabi ke baad unhone raajnneetik morche par utarane kaa faisla liya
 To date, the Shiv Sena is active in many states, but its political influence is highest in Maharashtra
 shivasena ko rajyastareey party kaa darja praapt he or chunaav ayog kii ore se use dhanush-baan chunaav chihn mila hua he
 The ideals of Bal Thackeray Shivaji Chhatrapati Shivaji was the ideal of Bal Thackeray and he was a great devotee of Maa Bhavani
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone maa bhavani ke vaahan sher ko shivasena ke pratik chinh ke rup main apanaaya
 On the day of Vijayadashami on October 30, 1966, the Shiv Sena organized the first rally at Shivathirtha which was a huge success
 party ne 1967 main marathi maanush ke mudde ko pehali baar uthaaya or is par raily yojit kii
 Khata Shiv Sena contested the first election in 1971 after coming into existence in the third attempt, but the new fledgling party did not succeed
 1973 main shivasena ke tikat par 39 corporators ko jeet mili
 In its third attempt in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena won for the first time
 iske baad 1990 main shivasena ne maharashtra vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladaa or 52 siton par jeet hasil kar lee or rajya main vipakshi dal kaa darja hasil kiya
 The 1989 deal with the BJP, the Shiv Sena's dominance in Maharashtra politics after the 1990s, is still intact, although the dominance has come down slightly
 party ne 1989 main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saath raajnneetik qaraar kiya
 This alliance first formed the government in 1995, but the Shiv Sena has been in opposition with the BJP since 1999
 tutaa gathbandhanhaalanki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle seat bantwaare ko lekar gathbandhan tut gaya or bijepi se alag ho gai
 Both contested separately in which the BJP emerged as the single largest party, but in the meantime Shiv Sena had announced to sit in the opposition
 haalanki kai daur kii baatcheet ke baad shivasena bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ko raji ho gai or yaheen par shivasena ko chote bhai ke darje ke rup main satta main bhagidaari kerani padi or devendra fadanvis ke rup main bijepi se mukhyamantri mila
 After this, the two parties fought together in the election of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Shiv Sena kingship continued in Mumbai
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se kareeb dedh saal pehle 2018 main shivasena ne bijepi or endie sarkaar se alag hone kaa faisla kiya, lekin isi saal farvari main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke prayaas ke dam par shivasena ne bijepi ke saath rajya main chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya or hisse main ai 23 siton par chunaav ladaa or 18 siton par jeet hasil kar endie main number 2 kii haisiyat hasil kar lee
 Although only one MP got a place in Narendra Modi's cabinet this time, the Shiv Sena is claiming the post of deputy speaker in Lok Sabha
 bal thakare ke baad uddhav thakare kii aguwai main shivasena ke paas 16veen loksabhaa main 18 loksabhaa saansad rahe or is baar bhi yahi sankhya rahi
 Since 2014, the importance of BJP in the politics of Maharashtra is increasing with the Shiv Sena
 2014 kii tarah 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena apni seat kii sankhya 18 se badhaane main naakaam rahi he jabaki bijepi ne 25 siton par chunaav ladakar 23 main jeet hasil kar liya
 In the last 5 years, the bjp's graph has been steadily rising in Maharashtra
 ab jab kuch maheene baad maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or donon partiyaan baraabar-baraabar siton par ladane ke liye sahamat hui hai
 Although the elections in the state will also be contested this time under the leadership of BJP, but the formula for the post of Chief Minister is not decided yet
 haalanki shivasena kaa kad narendra modi ke rashtriya raajnneeti main aane ke baad se rajya main gata hi he

 Rammana Kumar was aghast at the manner of maintenance of the jewelery of the temple and suggested further accountability and transparency in the matter
 unhone kahah mandir ke jewaron ko do rajpatrit adhikariyon kii nigaraanee main dohare taale vaali vyavastha main rakhen; rosemara ke aadhaar par jevar ke hastantaran or unke rakrakhaav kaa puraa byora rakhen, usamen samay, din or vyakti kaa naam likhaa jaae; titidi kaa sanyukt kaaryakari adhikari maheene main ek baar nirikshan kare; or titidi ke varisht adhikariyon kii maujuudagi main vaarshik jaanch kii jaae

 In addition, the connoisseurs who have used TTD to test jewelery are not experts in their field, so the valuation is not based on current market rates
 aise main in aabhushanon kii sahi keemat aankane ke liye visheshgyon kii samiti banane kii jarurat he, jo unki vyapak suchi taiyaar karen or har paanch saal par unke asli mulya ko aank saken
 The condition of recording and accounting is so pathetic that the total wealth of TTD in the country cannot be ascertained

 Ramna Kumar said that based on the vigilance reports of 2007 and 2008, no action was taken against the black marketing on the advance booking of tickets
 unka kahana he, ‘in karmchaariyon ko ishwar kaa koi dar nahin he, dand kaa bhay nahin he or unamem katai eemaandaaree nahin he
 He suggested that it should be investigated by the Andhra Pradesh Police and the system should be corrected by taking action against the culprits
 lekin ise nazarandaaj kar diya gaya
 Meanwhile, Director General of Police V
 dinesh reddy ke netritv main satarkta evam pravartan vibhaag ne anushthanon or darshan ke tikat kii kalabazari karne ke maamle kii swatantra jaanch kii
 He found that it consisted of three members of the TTD board — M
 anjaiya, kaale yadaiya or ji
 Subrahmanyam (all removed from the board last month) - was involved
 reddy ne titidi karmchaariyon, trevell agenton or dallalon samet 54 logon ke khilaaf dandatmak karrwai karne kii sifarish kii he
 The report states that the board members appoint personal assistants who, through their assistants, blacklist the tickets for the discretionary quota of service and philosophy of the board members
 usamen bataaya gaya he ki tikaton kii kalabazari main thirumala main kaam karne vaale titidi ke kuch karmchaaree bhi shaamil hai
 It also describes how tickets to the most popular folk ceremonies — such as Vashtram and Abhishekam — were issued by 2060 and deprived genuine pilgrims
 iske liye kuch beyimaan trevell agenton ne karmchaariyon kii mileebhagat se titidi kii website ko hack karke sari booking kar di
 At the time of the controversial members of the board leaving the post, Joint Executive Officer A

 Accused Dharma Reddy of indulging in such scams

 dinesh reddy ne 13 agast, 2010 ko rajya sarkaar ko 158 panne kii report saunpi, jisamen is ghapale ko rokane ke liye kai upaay karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 These are: - Proof of identity of the devotees should be sought after booking and their identity should be mixed when it comes at the time of rituals and darshan
 -titidi board ke nyaasiyon ke vivekadhin cote ko kam kiya jaae
 The provision of strict punishment should be made to treat such sale of tickets as a major offense
 is tarah ke suzav or upaay saamaanya hai
 Smaller institutions would have implemented them already
 lekin titidi kaa prabandhan dhaancha or variyatakram inhen lagu karne main baadhak he
 They do not allow any initiative to be implemented
 vidambnaa he ki audikesavulu ke netritv main board ne 2006 se mandir prashasan kii gatividhiyon kii vyapak jaanch karaane ke liye rajya sarkaar se sifarish karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 This is an acknowledgment of the board's failure to play the role of advisor
 lekin iske liye mukhyatah board ke ve 14 sadsy jimmedaar hai, jo ise mahatvapurn pad maanate hai
 He could do 'A' favoritism while in this position and in recent times his colleagues sold huge amount of money even to the ticket of Darshan
 agar unka koi faisla dharm yaa titidi ke vittiya hiton ke viruddh ho to sarkaar ke paas unhen rokane kaa adhikaar he
 For this the executive officer simply needs to inform the government
 titidi apni akut sampatti kii vajah se niyantran se baahar ho gaya he
 It will have to focus on managing its finances and outsourcing all other activities along with providing devotee-centric services such as hassle-free philosophy, security, prasadam and accommodation
 kharch kam karne ke saath hi lekha-jokha jaisi aantarik vyavasthaaon ko majboot karnaa hoga or vivekadhin cote ko kam karnaa hoga kyonki yah bhrashtachar kaa centre ban gaya he
 Unskilled and incompetent people have taken jobs as if it was a hereditary profession

 An insider from TTD said, 'god alone can remove chaos
 ’kisi tarah kaa sakht upaay karnaa mushkil he kyonki jhagadaalu karmchaaree titidi prabandhan kii aisi-taisi kar denge
 Many of them are not eligible for jobs and do not have career training opportunities
 par araajaktaa dur karne ke liye rajnatik hastkshep kam karnaa hoga or raajnneetikon ko titidi board se mukt karnaa hoga
 It should have representatives from donors, renowned public servants and experts who can improve the functioning of the board
 iske liye titidi ko jimmedaar korporate kii tarah chalaanaa hoga
 At the same time, government people useful in management of administration, finance, security and religious affairs will have to be involved
 rosaiya ko in sudhaaron ko lagu karne ke liye atyaadhunik vishisht praadhikaran ko hdhotsahit karnaa hoga

 bollywood ke ection king akshay kumaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa intervyuu liya
 The highlight of this interview is that the interview is based more on the personal life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi than politics
 akshay kumaar se baat chit par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane jivan ke kai dilachasp kisson ko saajha kiya he, unhone bataaya ki wo kaise khud ko feet rakhte hai
 PM Modi treats colds in this way - In a question, Akshay Kumar asked the PM, what do you do when you have a cold? In response to this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, they do 3 things when there is a cold
 pehla- zukam ke samay vah sirf garam pani hi pite hai
 Secondly, they fast, that is, they stay only after drinking hot water for 24 to 28 hours
 teesraa- garam sarson kii tel kii kuch boonden apni naak main daalate hai
 During PM Modi-interview, Akshay Kumar told Narendra Modi that he heard that you only sleep for 3 hours, whereas the body needs at least 7 hours of sleep
 isapar piem ne bataaya, 'main keval 3 se saadhe teen ghante kii hi sota hum
 My body cycle is like this
 mujhe 3 ghante se zyada neend nahin aati he
 My sleep is complete in a short time
 ' piem modi ne yah bhi bataaya ki purv raashtrapati obama bhi unhen bharpoor neend lene kii salaah dete hai or jab bhi milte hai unhen neend badhaane ke liye kehete hai
 Narendra Modi further said, 'I have come here after living a very difficult life
 main ayurveda main vishwaas rakhata hum
 He told about fatigue, i used to tie on the hot foot and put small wood on the middle of the foot, which brought pressure
 is tarah puri body kii main khud massage karata tha
 'how does PM Modi calm the anger? PM Modi told that if any such incident happens, which he did not like, he used to sit alone with the paper
 us ghatana kaa varnan likhte the, kya hua, kyon hua? phir us kaagaj ko fadkar phenk dete the
 Even after this, if the mind was not calm, then i used to write that event again
 isse unki sari bhavanaaen likhane ke baad jal jaati hai
 It also makes sense that they too are wrong

 a bench of Chief Justice g Rohini and Justice RS Andlaw rejected Vikas's appeal seeking parole for three more weeks after a week's parole was granted by a single bench of the High Court
 peeth ne kaha ki maamle ke tathyon or paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue hamen ekal nyaayadhish dwaara teen hafte kii parole se inkaar karne or keval ek hafte kii hiraasat main parole dene ke vivekadhikaar main hastkshep jaruri nahin lagata
 The bench held that awarding of parole is essentially discretionary, though the discretion exercised in it is based on several facts
 vikaas kii teen hafton kii parole kii yachika par ucch nyaayalay ne 20 april ko aadesh surakshit rakhaa tha
 He had sought parole for filing a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the judgment and the sentence pronounced by the High Court

 On Monday, the last meeting of the Select Committee took place on Sunday, in the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, except the Congress, all other parties agreed to the bill
 congress ke teen sadasyon ne is par decent note dekar apni asahmati jataai
 The Select Committee is to have its last meeting on Monday after which it will be presented in Parliament
 congress ko ab bhi is bill kii kuch baton ko lekar virodh he
 The Center will make full compensation of the losses of the states, because the government has managed to get the consent of most parties on this because now the central government has agreed to compensate 100 percent of the losses due to the states for the first five years

 Recently, in a flat in Dehradun with our son, we saw a bright table lamp placed on his desk
 hamen kuch santosh or abhimaan hua
 This table lamp was gifted to us by renowned Hindi writer Krishna Sobti
 hamane ise apane bete ke paas bhej diya- is pratikatmak ummid ke jaadu se vasheebhoot ki yah lamp usko krishna sobati ke hisse kii kuch roshni degaa
 This morning a loud voice told that Krishna did not sob
 unhone safadarajang ke ek aspataal main aakiri saans lee
 This hospital had become like their second home in the last few days
 beete saal jis din unhen gyanpith sammaan dene kii ghoshnaa hui thi, tab bhi ve aspataal jane kii taiyaari kar rahi thim or jis din unka aayojan hua, us din bhi ve aspataal main hi thim
 Will Priyanka Gandhi prove to be the trump card? But it would be completely wrong to infer from the hospital movement that Krishna Sobti was helpless or katar from somewhere
 94 baras kii is apratim hindi lekhika kii apni shaareerik pareshaaniyaan rahi hongi, umr kaa kuch dabaav rahaa hoga, lekin man se ve puri tarah swasth thim or kush bhi
 Jeevat was the seed word of his literature, in fact it was also the basic mantra of his life
 ve apni nayikaon kii tarah diler thim
 In the case of her heroines, the frustration of being 'victim' or 'victim' is never seen in them
 jivan unke liye apni zid par amal kaa naam he
 They are fearless, fearless, stereotypical women who repeatedly challenge the status quo, do not accept life on its given terms, try to change it in their own way
 saradari se pitati hui mitro kahin se laachaar najar nahin aati, vah apni daihikta ke taap kaa nibasancoch zikr karti he, saradari laal ke doston ke saath khul kar gap karti he, or apni saas or devraniyon ko bhi jab tab yaad dilaa detii he ki vah unke ulahnon or unki tohamaton ke paar he
 Of course, these heroines sometimes go back to an extent, but it is their decision to return
 yah jeevat unhen jujharu banaata he, sundar banaata he or jane-anjaane ek chhuti hui ladaai kaa sipaahi banaata he
 Her memoir books such as' Hum Hashmat ', from' Dar Se Bichhidi ',' Zindaginama '' a Girl ',' Surajmukhi Dark Ke Ke 'to' Samay Sargam 'and Pakistan Gujarat to Hindustan Gujarat' - all this biography, a mirror of combativeness and warmth
 narendra modi ko gathbandhan kyon daraata he?hindi sahitya main aaj bahut si lekhikaayen hai
 Like an explosion like female writing and female discourse is in front of us
 lekin yah sthiti anayas nahin bani he
 Its sources also go to some people whose writing, Krishna Sobti was important
 ve jis daur main likh rahi thim, vah multah purush lekhakon kaa daur tha- us lekhan main madhyavargeey jivan kii bahut sari kashmakash thi lekin striyon kii jagah nahin thi yaa thi bhi to purushon dwaara nirmit chhavi ke aasapaas thi
 Then there were very few writers who distinguished themselves among the writers of their time
 mahadevi verma or subhadra kumari chouhan jaisi kavyitriyon ke baad- khaas kar gadhy lekhan main- krishna sobati or mannu bhandari ko is silsile kii praarambhik kadiyon main gina ja saktaa he
 These two writers competed against the storytellers of their time - Rajendra Yadav, Kamleshwar, Mohan Rakesh, Bhishma Sahni, Nirmal Verma etc
 on a level of fame
 baad main mridula garg, mamata kaaliya, ushaa priyanvada, chitra mudgal or nasira sharma jaisi lekhikaon ne is parampara ko or pukhtagi di
 Of course, the shadow of Krishna Sobti's prolific Virat writings overshadowed the entire Hindi literature and society
 achaanak ve shokh, bebaak or ziddi nayikaayen aam ho gayi jinaki kahaniyaan kehane se log bachate the
 Although these ideological formulas of women, freedom or equality did not come from zero in the writings of Krishna Sobti or did not exist like a single stubbornness, they were part of an overall ideology in which the culture of free India and the ideal of equality was also in place
 was
 lahore main padhi or dilli ko apana thikaana banane vaali krishna sobati ko vibhaajan kii takaleef maaloom thi or yah baat samaj main aati thi ki raajnneetik yaa sampradayik kattarataayen manushyata se apni kitni badi qeemat vasuul karti hai
 This is the reason why he did not hesitate to raise voice in recent times against the increasing communalism and intolerance
 ham sabko seenchne vaale namvar aspataal main hai94 saal kii umr main un jaise jeevat kii kalpana karnaa mushkil he
 Whenever she met, she used to meet with great enthusiasm, not about her problems, she would talk about the country and the world
 unke liye maujuuda daur ke raajnneetik halaat bahut ahmiyat rakhte the
 He felt that this is not what is being created in his imagination
 kareeb do saal pehle jab main unase milane gaya tha to unhone bahut shiddat se in sab par baat kii
 We were just overwhelmed to see how mentally fit this ninety-plus writer is
 aaj subah meri jansatta ke purv sampadak or buddhijivi om thanvi se baat hui
 He was remembering that even in these days of illness, he had not given up his arrogance
 thanvi ji ne bataaya ki kuch din pehle jab ve baahar the or krishna sobati se mil nahin paae to krishna ji kaa mobile par record kiya hua ek sandesh unhen mila- aapke bina dilli kuch kam dilli lag rahi he
 i thought - even without Krishna Sobti, the world has become a world, Hindi has become a little Hindi and Delhi has become less Delhi

 Kuldeep Yadav said after the match that the intention of the team was to improve the run rate so that they finished the match in 14 overs
 jaldi khatm karne kaa kya hua phayda?match ko 6
 The advantage of winning as soon as 1 over was that KKR pushed CSK to number two in the points table despite Chennai and Kolkata teams having 8-8 points
 kyonki ran rate ke maamle main kolkata chennai se kahin aage nikal chuki thi
 If this match was drawn for 20 overs, Rajasthan's run rate could have deteriorated
 kuldeep ne aage kaha ki jaipur kii pich kaaphi dhimi thi
 It was difficult for me to bowl there, but the pitch was good for the other bowlers in the team
 yahi kaaran he ki piyush chawla or harry garne ne kifayati gendbaaji kii or rajasthan kii team 139 ran hi bana saki
 Kuldeep also said that we performed as a team, which gave us success

 Ajit Singh has simultaneously launched a political attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party
 mayawati jitani bhaajapa par baraseen, utani hi congress se bhi khaufjada dikhin
 Akhilesh and Ajit tried to woo the Dalit votes in Mayawati's presence
 mayawati ne do took kaha, ‘piem ko jab is mahareli kii apaar bheed kii jaankaree milegi to ve gathbandhan se ghabaraakar pagalaa jaaenge
 He blamed both BJP and Congress equally for the current situation in the country
 raily main mayawati ne kataaksh kiya ki chunavi mausam main hi in donon partiyon ko garibon ko paise dene kii yojanaayen, dharmasthalon main maathaa techne ke alaava ganga yatra or khaat yatra yaad aati hai
 Mayawati cautioned Muslims especially the Congress and Akhilesh called the Congress and the BJP one
 ajit ne to aawaara maweshiyon ko ‘yogi or modi’ kah daalaa
 Mayawati was the first and the last to speak in the Maharaeli of Deoband
 unhone shuruuaat pradhanmantri narendra modi par apane bhaashan main hamale se kii
 She said, PM Modi from the alliance is nervous and can say anything after 'it'
 aazaadee ke baad centre or desh ke adhikansh rajyon main congress or bhaajapa kii sarkarein satta main raheen
 The Congress is out of power due to its anti-people policies and BJP is going to be out
 is baar chaukeedaar kii naatakabaaji bhi kaam aane vaali nahin he
 The BJP, which came to power by luring every class, did not fulfill even a quarter of its promises
 pulavama hamale ke din bhi bhaajapa kii naatakabaaji se inke rashtravaadi hone kaa pardaafash ho chukaa he
 The central government of the BJP spent thousands of crores of rupees from the public exchequer for its own benefit, which could be spent in the poor interest
 mayawati ne ganna mulya ke bakaayaa par bhaajapa ko gheraa or yaad dilaayaa ki basapa ke shashan main ganna bhugtan na karne vaale mil maalikon ko jail bheja gaya tha
 In the case of brokerage in defense deals, Mayawati attacked the Congress and the BJP together and instructed her votebank to beware of lies in the media, opinion polls and electoral surveys
 musalamaanon ko bhi aagaah kiya ki congress is laayak nahin he, jise vot diya jaae
 SP National President Akhilesh Yadav called this Lok Sabha election a history maker and said that West UP is the land of farmers
 aaj ganna kisaan badahaal hai or pashchimi upi ke pehle charan ke chunaav vaale jilon main hi chini milon par ganna kisaanon kaa 5 hajaar karod rupee kaa bhugtan bakaayaa he
 Youth are unemployed, countries of the world have progressed, but our country has lagged behind
 jis desh ke naujavaanon ke gyaan-vigyaan se aage badhanaa tha, vahaan nafrat kii deevaaren khadi kar di gai
 After the British, the BJP has implemented divide and rule in the country
 bhaajapa vaale dharm ke thekedaar banate hai, lekin kumbh main kaise nahaate hai yah puri duniya ne dekha
 If you see the Kumbh Snan of the UP Chief Minister, then people stop taking a bath

 This is an election of change and brotherhood
 bhaajapa vaale gathbandhan se ghabaraae hue hai or loksabhaa upachunaav ke nateezon main ham bhaajapa ko jawaab de chuke hai
 He said that the Congress is the BJP and the BJP is the Congress
 congress bhi badlaav nahin laana chaahati he
 Chaul, the head of Rallod
 ajit singh ne apana puraa focus kisaanon or daliton par rakhaa
 Said, the Constitution has given us the right to vote and the Constitution is given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 bhaajapa ise chhinana chaahati he
 If this is the right, all parties take a certificate from the public every five years and if it is not there, nothing will be left
 modi par kataaksh karte hue vah bole- sirf pradhanmantri ke achche din aae
 He eats for free, changes suit three times a day and travels abroad at government expense
 aisi sarkaar ko thokar maar deni chahie
 Modi had promised that as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, farmers would be paid 150 per cent of the cost of production of crops and sugarcane in 14 days, but nothing happened
 bhaajapa kii sarkaar ne ganne kaa daam ek rupaya nahin badhaayaa, lekin mayawati or mulaayam singh yadav kii sarkaron ne ganne kaa daam khub badhaayaa
 Mayawati took strict steps against the non-paying mill owners
 west upi kii arthvyavastha ganne kii fasal par nirbhar karti he
 Earlier there was a sugar mill within a radius of 25 km, but they made this distance 15 km
 unke prayaason se 15 saalon main 47 nai chini milen lageen
 Earlier one third used to go to sugarcane mills, but due to more sugar mills, all the sugarcane mills started going
 akhilesh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa kisaan virdohi he or mujffarnagar main dange karakar satta main ai
 Ajit also discussed the impact of demonetisation and GST and took a dig at the stray cattle trampling farmers' crops, calling them Modi and Yogi
 teenon hi netaaon ne gathbandhan pratyaashiyon ke liye alag-alag vot dene kii apil logon se kii
 This rally of the crowd in terms of crowd was similar to the rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which the participation of Dalits, Muslims and Jats was seen
 kuch noujvaan bhim army pramukh chandrashekhar ke poster bhi manch ke saamne laharaate rahe, lekin mayawati ne is par koi dhyaan nahin diya
 However, it is definitely said that the BJP will try to cut votes through some fake organizations and parties, so be careful

 He said that the tremendous mandate further increases the responsibilities

 But the 2019 election broke the wall and connected hearts

 In the Central Hall of Parliament House, he said, there can be no distinction line for the people's representative

 This election is a positive vote election
 phir se sarkaar ko laana he, kaam dena he, jimmedaari deni he
 This positive thinking has given such a big mandate
 piem ne kaha, 2014 main bhaajapa ko jitne vot mili or 2019 main jo vot mili, unamem jo ijapha hua he, vah kareeb-kareeb 25 pratishat he
 But in the global scenario, our increment is as much as the number of votes the President Trump received

 This not only increased the political stir, but PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti also started protesting
 ab sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki grih mantralay main philhal aisi koi kavayad nahin chal rahi
 There was no discussion about delimitation in the meeting of Home Minister Amit Shah
 vahiin aisa koi prastaav bhi grih mantralay ke kisi teble par nahin he
 In fact, after Amit Shah became the Home Minister, there were reports in the media that the Central Government is preparing to delimit Jammu and Kashmir
 in atakalon ko jor tab mila, jab amit shah ne grih mantralay sanbhaalane ke baad jammu kashmir ke rajyapal satyapal malik ke saath baithak bhi kii
 In this context, it was believed that Mission Kashmir is their special target

 jammu-kashmir bijepi ke adhyaksh kavindra gupta ne bhi kaha tha ki vah rajyapal ko parisemen ke liye likh chuke hai, taaki jammu, kashmir or ladakh kshetra ke saath nyaay ho
 What BJP leaders want: Jammu and Kashmir has 111 assembly seats
 philhal 87 siton par hi chunaav hote hai
 The reason for this is that according to section 47 of the Constitution, 24 seats are kept vacant
 darasal, khaali 24 siten paak adhikrut kashmir ke liye chodi gayi thim
 Sources are telling that local BJP leaders want these 24 empty seats to be added to the account of Jammu region, so that it can benefit
 kyonki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi yahaan kul 37 main se 25 siten jeet chukin hai
 Due to this, BJP is considered to be the dominant in Jammu
 kab hua tha aakhri parisemanjammu-kashmir main aakhri baar 1995 main parisemen hua tha
 According to the state's constitution, there was to be delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir after every 10 years
 magar tatkaaleen siem faruk abdulla ne 2002 main is par 2026 tak ke liye roak laga di thi
 Other states in the country have been delimited based on the 2002 census

 aise main ve log kahaniyon main khalanaayak ho jate the jo inamen feet nahin baithte the
 At one time the mill owners were also villains

 ab utane kattar naitik mulya bhi nahin rahe
 It is no longer considered wrong to be clever and opportunistic
 ab koi vichaar yaa naitik mulya kaala yaa safed athwa galat yaa sahi nahin rahaa

 antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) ne srilanka ke ballebaaj kusaal perera ke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai waapas le lee he or pratibandhit dawaaon ke kathith istemaal ko lekar un par lagaaya gaya asthaayee nilamban bhi waapas le liya gaya he
 Kusal Perera may now return to domestic and international cricket with immediate effect
 isisi ne yah faisla katar main wada kii manyata praapt lab dwaara mul jaanch kaa nateeja waapas liye jane ke baad liya
 ICCK chief executive David Richardson said, "we want to make it clear that no evidence has been found that Perera consumed the banned drugs
" ham use bhavishya ke liye shubhakamana dete hai
 In November 2015, the accredited lab of WADA in Qatar had informed the ICC that an examination of Pereira's urine samples outside the competition found him guilty of consuming 19 norandrostenedione which is a steroid included in wada's banned list
 iske baad saat disambar 2015 ko isisi ko perera ko doping nirodhak niyamon ke ulanghan ke aarope main asthaayee taur par nilambit kar diya tha
 The ICC sought further information from Qatar's lab and continued to extend Pereira's legal team for further investigation and analysis
 katar kii lab ne bi namoonay kii jaanch kii jo perera ne janvari 2016 main diya tha
 He then confirmed that samples of this steroid were found in the samples
 haal hi ke patr main perera ke vakeelon ne namoonay main paye gaye steroid ke sambhavit sutara kii jaankaree di
 For the first time it also stated that Qatar's lab may have misidentified the impurities found in the samples as norandrostenedione had very light amounts in the samples
 isisi ne swatantra visheshgy se katar kii lab ke jaanch kii samiksha karai
 The expert said that the lab's result was correct but also said that for many scientific and technical reasons, it cannot be ruled out that norandrostenedione was born naturally in the player's body

 There is a Municipal Corporation Primary Children's School in Sant Ravidas Nagar K-block in Jahangirpuri, Delhi, where about 600 children from first to fourth class are forced to sit on the sackcloth even in cold weather
 bacchon ko thand na lage iske liye skool ne sirf dabl taat-pattee kar di he
 However, the cold air from the broken windows of the windows is entering the rooms and shaking the innocent
 saath hi class khatm hone ke baad bacchon se safai kaa kaam bhi karavaaya jaataa he
 The MCD schools of Jahangirpuri ward do not have benches to seat children
 chote bachche thande farsh par baithne ko hi majaboor hai
 According to a statistic, about 26,000 children sit on the ground in MCD schools
 bi block sthit yah skool sirf ek baangi bhar he jahaan pehali se chauthi class tak ke kareeb 600 bachche farsh par baithne ko majaboor hai
 In 19 schools, children are forced to sit on the sackcloth for the last 10 years
 parshad punam bagdi kaa kahana he ki kai baar adhikariyon ko avgat karaane ke baad bhi ab tak in skulon ke liye bench nahin mili
 About 19,400 benches are needed in 6 schools of Jahangirpuri ward
 ek adhyapika ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par kaha ki ye bachche to unifarm hi nahin puure pahane hote hai, ham inke maa-baap ko dabl kapade pehanaane ko kehete hai, jisase inhen thand naa lag jaae par ye nahin maanate
 The condition of the corporation school located in the c block is even worse
 skool chuta nahin kii bachche taat-pattee class room se baahar ke kamare main rakhane ja rahe hai
 The girls are cleaning the class room
 bachche kursi dhone ko majaboor hai or apane sir par teble lekar ja rahe he
 Many children were seen carrying litter buckets to dustbin
 wo bhi saream teachers kii ankhon ke saamne, lekin kisi ne bhi bacchon ko nahin roka
 It seems that this is the daily habit of the mousse, but the question is why are the children forced to do this? When we talked to the North MCD Mayor Adesh Gupta, he said that there should be a tender of about 15,000 benches Already happened
 unhone daawa kiya ki jaldi hi bench skulon main aa jaaenge
 The North MCD Mayor has called for action against those who work for children

 The reason for this is the formation of a substance in the body's tissues and blood, which is called bilirubin
 koi bhi sthiti jinke kaaran billirubin kii gatividhiyaan rakt se liver or sharir se baahar baadhit hoti hai
 It causes jaundice
 billirubin pile rang kaa pigment he, jo ki liver main mrit laal rakt koshikaon ke tuutane se banataa he
 Apart from this, there are many other ways through which bilirubin is formed
 isamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap ke kaaran pilia kii beemaari hoti he yaa bina unki ijazat ke kisi kii raily main jane par shraap dene se pilia hota he
 If we are not spared from this daily practice of foolishness, then one day we will understand our ignorance as science
 koi itihaas ko lekar jhooth bol detaa he, koi vigyaan ko lekar kuch bhi bol detaa he
 Are we ready to teach these idiots in school books now? vaigyanik or maanavtawaad main ham kis kadar fail hue hai, iskaa ek krur namoona dikhaata hum
 Not only institutions, but also in society, there are so many layers of cruelty that we do not know where humanism and brotherhood has ended, or when the proof of its end will come in front of us
 sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died
 iske liye jaanch kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This is not the first incident, in recent times, there have been so many incidents across the country which show that a section is becoming increasingly large which has determined not to tolerate a particular section on the basis of caste and religion
 Have taken jati or dharm ke naam par nafrat failaane kii raajnneeti kaa yah nateeja ham dekh rahe hai
 a news was published in the Times of India on 21 March 2018
 mehsana ke ek dalit kaaryakarta ke artiai ke jawaab main jaankaree saamne ai ki gujarat main 2017 ke saal main 1515 maamle darj hue the jo pichley 17 saal main sabase adhik tha
 Today, Amit Shah was talking about the oppression of Dalits in Karnataka
 jo ki sahi bhi hoga, magar kya ve gujarat kii baat kar sakate hai
 According to NCRB data, Gujarat ranks 10 and Karnataka 6 in Dalit oppression
 kis rajya main yah nafrat nahin he or is nafrat ko kis raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke logon se prashray mil rahaa he
 It is getting a boost
 karnataka chunaavon ke dauraan loktantr ke khatare kii khub baat hui he
 But you will not see any leader in danger
 khatare main to lok rahata he
 Whenever you are alone, apart from the crowd, you realize that you are in danger, not a leader talking about democracy
 duniya main chaahe jitani badi braking news ho jaae, noujvaan har din yahi massej karte hai ki naukari series par kab lautenge
 Talk about our job
 magar yahi noujvaan nafrat kii raajnneeti main jalaavan ke kaam bhi aa rahe hai
 It is difficult to understand what is the priority of the youth
 ve is vakt nafrat kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai yaa naukari kii baat zyaada soch rahe hai
 Hopefully they will understand the words of hate
 naukari kii baat unke alaava koi or nahin samajhegaa
 Neither the leader nor the media
 phir bhi ham naukari series par laut rahe hai
 It is really being unfair to the youth
 jis vakt noujvaan naukari maang rahe hai, us vakt koi unki naukari kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The job is only on hoarding during elections
 ham koshish karenge ki apane simit sansadhano ke sahare ki alag-alag rajyon main phir se laut kar denkhenge ki jwining letters milane main kyon deree ho rahi he, kitni deree ho rahi he, vigyaapan nikalne ke baad pariksha main deree kyon ho rahi he, aap naujavaanon se ummid he ki primetimewithravish@gmail
 Send in detail on com and write your number
 ham sabhi kii samasyaayein to nahin dikhaa paaenge, yah baat abhi kahana zaruri bhi he, magar koshish hogi ki jiskaa dayera bada hoga, ham dikhaaenge
 Its effect will be only when you are more interested in the matter of others than you, otherwise you will see with the intention of seeing your own, the system will not matter
 banaras kaa ek chaatr hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ke paas aayaa
 He claims that he had passed the examination of the staff selection but the information of passing did not arrive in time and he could not get the document checked
 uskaa rank 12waan tha, iske baad bhi vah naukari se rah gaya
 This boy named Akash Pandey is wandering here and there
 ab uske kaam na to hindu muslim vaale aa rahe hai na bhagwaan
 Went to court
 magar is vakt sthiti yah he ki akaash ko naukari nahin mili
 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked
 baharhaal is baat ko lekar chaatro main naaraazgi he
 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure
 naukari series ke pehle charan main hamane dikhaaya tha ki siechaesel 2015 or sijiel 2016 kii pariksha main paas kiye chaatro ko paas karne ke baad bhi jwining letters nahin mil rahaa he
 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain
 There is not much good within the banking world
 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 He was hit by three abuses

 In protest against this murder, bank employees took out a candle march in Muzaffarpur

 The bank series will also return, provided the bankers continue to tell us the inside things honestly

 He has said, "unless someone from your state and district team goes between you till taking the instructions of Omprakash Rajbhar, then if anyone goes close to any party, then understand that Omprakash Rajbhar will curse him, what will happen There will be curse, he will have jaundice
 
 You have come here, think it will cause jaundice, it will happen only when Omprakash Rajbhar's medicines are taken, then only jaundice will be fine or else it will not be right
 
 
 ' They are telling the public not to go to another party rally because Omprakash ji will curse and when he curses, he will get jaundice
 hamaare netaaon ko vaigyanik prashikshan kii sakht zarurat he
 At least Om Prakash Rajbhar should go to the National Health Portal of the Government of India where the reasons for jaundice have been explained
 un kaarnon main kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap dene se pilia kii beemaari hoti he
 Not only this, after getting jaundice, Rajbhar ji also gives medicines to recover, from which lab is that medicine available, only he can tell
 bharat kii raajnneeti main netaa kuch bhi bol kar nikal jate hai
 This confidence of him should be praised
 koi vipaksh ke netaa ko kutta billi saanp chhuchhuundar kah detaa he, koi rajyapal ko kutta kah detaa he

 The term jaundice is used to refer to yellowing of the skin and whitening of the eyes
 iskaa kaaran sharir ke utakon va rakt main ek padaarth kaa nirmaan hota he, jise billirubin kehete hai
 Any condition due to which the activity of bilirubin is obstructed by blood from the liver and outside the body
 uske kaaran pilia hota he
 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver
 iske alaava kai anya tareeke hai jinke madhyam se billirubin banataa he
 It is not written anywhere that jaundice is caused by Omprakash Rajbhar's curse or jaundice is caused by cursing when he goes to any rally without his permission

 i show a cruel example of how much we have failed in scientific and humanism
 sirf sansthaaen hi nahin, samaaj main bhi krurta kii itani paraten hai ki maanavtawaad or bhaichara kahaan khatm ho gaya he yaa iske khatm hone kaa pramaan kis rup main kab hamaare saamne aa jayega ham nahin jaanate
 Think, what would have been the crime, what could have been the reason for hating this person so much that he is being tied and killed in this way
 gujarat ke rajkot kii ek factory se mila yah video he jise vidhayak jignesh mewaani ne twit kiya tha
 The man who is being killed has died
 police kii shikaayat ke anusaar auto part kii factory ke maalik ke aadesh par ise is tarah baandh kar maaraa gaya
 His wife was also killed
 mukesh vania cheekhta rahaa, chillaata rahaa magar maarane waalon par koi fark nahin padaa
 Jignesh told that Mukesh Vaniya is from Dalit community
 ye aaj ke hindustan kii tasviir he
 Even after how much debate took place in 2016 after the Una incident in Gujarat, there was no difference within the society
 jati yaa amir hone kaa ahankaar itnaa bada kaise ho jaataa he ki ek manushya ko is tarah baandh kar maaraa jaataa he
 Mukesh's wife somehow ran away, asking for help from the villagers, but by the time she returned, Mukesh was lying on the floor
 astapatal le jate jate uski maut ho chuki thi
 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin
 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail

 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
 hamane esayssi ko jawaab ke liye email kiya he, jab aayega yaa agar aayega to dikhaaenge magar hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr system ke dhimi gati ke shikaar hote rahenge to kaise chalegaa
 These students are so timid or say that they are nervous that they cannot even make their videos
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr hai, inaki maang bhi jaays he phir bhi agar saamne nahin aaenge to ham dikhaaenge kaise
 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously
 bich main chhod diya kyonki baat aage bad nahin rahi thi
 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada
 is hatya ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ne muzaffarpur main candal march nikaala

 Please provide your number ye janata se kah rahe hai ki duusare dal kii raily main nahin jaae kyonki omprakash ji shraap de denge or jab shraap de denge to pilia kii beemaari ho jaaegi
 Our leaders are in dire need of scientific training
 kam se kam om prakaash rajbhar bharat sarkaar ke rashtriya swasthya portal par chale jaaen jahaan pilia hone ke kaaran bataae gaye hai
 Nowhere is it written that the curse of Omprakash Rajbhar causes jaundice
 yahi nahin pilia ho jane par rajbhar ji thik hone kii dawaai bhi dete hai, wo dawa kis lab se paas he, vahi bataa sakate hai
 In India's politics, leaders leave by speaking anything
 unke is aatmavishvaas kii prashansa kii jaani chahie
 Some call the Leader of the Opposition a dog cat snake petals, others call the Governor a dog
 kisi ko plastic surgery kaa mul ganesh ji main dikh jaataa he to kisi ko aaj kii duniya kii har chiz us daur main dikh jaati he jiske pramaan kabhi mili hi nahin
 Look confidently that on Constitution Day, Ambedkar also chants Ambedkar's name, forgetting that the development of scientific attitude has been described in the Constitution as the duty of every citizen
 pilia shabd kaa upyog twachaa ke peelepan or ankhon kii safedi bataane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The reason for this is the formation of a substance in the body's tissues and blood, which is called bilirubin
 koi bhi sthiti jinke kaaran billirubin kii gatividhiyaan rakt se liver or sharir se baahar baadhit hoti hai
 It causes jaundice
 billirubin pile rang kaa pigment he, jo ki liver main mrit laal rakt koshikaon ke tuutane se banataa he
 Apart from this, there are many other ways through which bilirubin is formed
 isamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki omprakash rajbhar ke shraap ke kaaran pilia kii beemaari hoti he yaa bina unki ijazat ke kisi kii raily main jane par shraap dene se pilia hota he
 If we are not spared from this daily practice of foolishness, then one day we will understand our ignorance as science

 sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died

 banaras kaa ek chaatr hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ke paas aayaa
 He claims that he had passed the examination of the staff selection but the information of passing did not arrive in time and he could not get the document checked
 uskaa rank 12waan tha, iske baad bhi vah naukari se rah gaya
 This boy named Akash Pandey is wandering here and there
 ab uske kaam na to hindu muslim vaale aa rahe hai na bhagwaan
 Went to court
 magar is vakt sthiti yah he ki akaash ko naukari nahin mili
 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked

 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure

 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain
 There is not much good within the banking world
 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 He was hit by three abuses
 alok navada ke varasaliganj thane ke kutary gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 In protest against this murder, bank employees took out a candle march in Muzaffarpur
 haal hi main jaipur main bankeron ne apni suraksha or anya maangon ko lekar dharna diya tha
 The bank series will also return, provided the bankers continue to tell us the inside things honestly

 The term jaundice is used to refer to yellowing of the skin and whitening of the eyes
 iskaa kaaran sharir ke utakon va rakt main ek padaarth kaa nirmaan hota he, jise billirubin kehete hai
 Any condition due to which the activity of bilirubin is obstructed by blood from the liver and outside the body
 uske kaaran pilia hota he
 Bilirubin is a yellow pigment formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells in the liver
 iske alaava kai anya tareeke hai jinke madhyam se billirubin banataa he
 It is not written anywhere that jaundice is caused by Omprakash Rajbhar's curse or jaundice is caused by cursing when he goes to any rally without his permission

 Some lie about history, some tell anything about science
 kya ham taiyaar hai ki skool kii kitabon main inhen moorkhtaaon ko ab padhaayaa jaae
 i show a cruel example of how much we have failed in scientific and humanism
 sirf sansthaaen hi nahin, samaaj main bhi krurta kii itani paraten hai ki maanavtawaad or bhaichara kahaan khatm ho gaya he yaa iske khatm hone kaa pramaan kis rup main kab hamaare saamne aa jayega ham nahin jaanate
 Think, what would have been the crime, what could have been the reason for hating this person so much that he is being tied and killed in this way
 gujarat ke rajkot kii ek factory se mila yah video he jise vidhayak jignesh mewaani ne twit kiya tha
 The man who is being killed has died
 police kii shikaayat ke anusaar auto part kii factory ke maalik ke aadesh par ise is tarah baandh kar maaraa gaya
 His wife was also killed
 mukesh vania cheekhta rahaa, chillaata rahaa magar maarane waalon par koi fark nahin padaa
 Jignesh told that Mukesh Vaniya is from Dalit community
 ye aaj ke hindustan kii tasviir he
 Even after how much debate took place in 2016 after the Una incident in Gujarat, there was no difference within the society
 jati yaa amir hone kaa ahankaar itnaa bada kaise ho jaataa he ki ek manushya ko is tarah baandh kar maaraa jaataa he
 Mukesh's wife somehow ran away, asking for help from the villagers, but by the time she returned, Mukesh was lying on the floor
 astapatal le jate jate uski maut ho chuki thi
 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin
 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail

 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
 hamane esayssi ko jawaab ke liye email kiya he, jab aayega yaa agar aayega to dikhaaenge magar hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr system ke dhimi gati ke shikaar hote rahenge to kaise chalegaa
 These students are so timid or say that they are nervous that they cannot even make their videos
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr hai, inaki maang bhi jaays he phir bhi agar saamne nahin aaenge to ham dikhaaenge kaise
 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously
 bich main chhod diya kyonki baat aage bad nahin rahi thi
 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada
 is hatya ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ne muzaffarpur main candal march nikaala
 Recently, bankers staged a sit-in in Jaipur for their security and other demands

 Not only institutions, but also in society, there are so many layers of cruelty that we do not know where humanism and brotherhood has ended, or when the proof of its end will come in front of us
 sochie, aisa kya gunaah rahaa hoga iskaa, is vyakti se itani nafrat hone kii kya vajah rahi hogi ki is tarah se baandh kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 This is a video from a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat, which was tweeted by MLA Jignesh Mevani
 yah aadmi jise maaraa ja rahaa he, wo mar gaya
 According to the police complaint, on the orders of the owner of the auto part factory, it was tied and killed like this
 isaki patni ko bhi maaraa gaya
 Mukesh Vaniya shouted, kept shouting but there was no difference to those who killed him
 jignesh ne bataaya ki mukesh vania dalit samudaay se he
 This is a picture of today's India
 2016 main gujarat main oona kii ghatana ke baad kitni bahes hui uske baad bhi samaaj ke bheetar koi fark nahin padaa
 How does the ego of caste or getting rich become so big that a human being is tied and killed like this
 mukesh kii patni kisi tarah bhaagi, gaanv waalon se madad maangi lekin jab tak vah lauti, mukesh zamin par adhamra padaa tha
 He had died while carrying him to the hospital
 isaki jaan lene vaale paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya or essi / asti act ke tahat mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 His names are Chirag Vora, Divyesh Vora, Jaisukh Radadia, Tejas Zala
 paanchavaa abhiyukt 18 saal se kam kaa he magar use bhi hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Police are investigating the claims of both the sides but Mukesh Vaniya has died
 iske liye jaanch kii koi zarurat nahin he
 This is not the first incident, in recent times, there have been so many incidents across the country which show that a section is becoming increasingly large which has determined not to tolerate a particular section on the basis of caste and religion

 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain
 There is not much good within the banking world
 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai
 He was hit by three abuses
 alok navada ke varasaliganj thane ke kutary gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 In protest against this murder, bank employees took out a candle march in Muzaffarpur
 haal hi main jaipur main bankeron ne apni suraksha or anya maangon ko lekar dharna diya tha
 The bank series will also return, provided the bankers continue to tell us the inside things honestly

 Think, what would have been the crime, what could have been the reason for hating this person so much that he is being tied and killed in this way
 gujarat ke rajkot kii ek factory se mila yah video he jise vidhayak jignesh mewaani ne twit kiya tha
 The man who is being killed has died
 police kii shikaayat ke anusaar auto part kii factory ke maalik ke aadesh par ise is tarah baandh kar maaraa gaya
 His wife was also killed
 mukesh vania cheekhta rahaa, chillaata rahaa magar maarane waalon par koi fark nahin padaa
 Jignesh told that Mukesh Vaniya is from Dalit community
 ye aaj ke hindustan kii tasviir he
 Even after how much debate took place in 2016 after the Una incident in Gujarat, there was no difference within the society
 jati yaa amir hone kaa ahankaar itnaa bada kaise ho jaataa he ki ek manushya ko is tarah baandh kar maaraa jaataa he
 Mukesh's wife somehow ran away, asking for help from the villagers, but by the time she returned, Mukesh was lying on the floor
 astapatal le jate jate uski maut ho chuki thi
 a case under murder and SC / ST Act has been registered against the five people who killed it
 inke naam hai chiraag vora, divyesh vora, jaysukh radadia, tejas jaala
 The fifth accused is under 18 years of age but has also been detained
 police donon pakshon ke daawey kii jaanch kar rahi he magar mukesh vania kii maut ho gai he
 There is no need to investigate for this
 yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, haal philhal ke dinon main hi desh bhar main itani ghatnaayen ho chuki hai jo bataati hai ki ek tabaka lagaataar bada hota ja rahaa he jisane jati or dharm ke aadhaar par ek khaas tabake ko bardaasht na karne kii zid thaan lee he
 We are seeing this result of the politics of spreading hate in the name of caste and religion
 21 march 2018 ke times of india main ek khabar chhapi thi
 An RTI reply by a Dalit activist from Mehsana revealed that Gujarat had 1515 cases registered in the year 2017, the highest in the past 17 years
 aaj hi amit shah karnataka main dalit utpeedan kii baat kar rahe the
 Which will also be right, but can they talk about Gujarat
 enciarabi ke data ke hisaab se dalit utpeedan main gujarat kaa sthaan 10 he or karnataka kaa 6
 Which state does not have this hatred and which political ideology is getting this hate from people
 badhaava mil rahaa he
 There has been a lot of talk of the danger of democracy during the Karnataka elections
 magar aapako koi netaa khatare main nahin dikhegaa
 Public remains in danger jab bhi aap akele hote hai, bheed se alag, aapako pataa chalata he ki aap khatare main hai, loktantr kii baat karne vaale netaa nahin
 No matter how big the breaking news is in the world, every day youngsters make the message that when will they return to the job series
 hamaari naukari kii baat kiijie
 But the same youth are also using firewood in the politics of hate
 samajhnaa mushkil he ki naujavaanon kii praathamikta kya he
 They are thinking more of hate at the moment or are thinking more about jobs
 ummid he ve nafrat kii baton ko samajhenge
 No one else will understand the job
 na netaa na media
 Nevertheless, we are returning to the job series
 naujavaanon ke saath vaaki ninsaphi ho rahi he
 At the time when young people are seeking jobs, no one is talking about their jobs
 naukari kii baat sirf chunaavon ke samay hording par hoti he
 We will try to return to different states again with the help of our limited resources to see why there is a delay in getting the joining letter, how much it is delayed, why the examination is delayed after the advertisement is out, you Youngsters are expected primetimewithravish @ gmail

 a student from Banaras came to our colleague Ajay Singh
 uskaa daawa he ki usne staff salection kii pariksha paas to kar lee thi magar paas hone kii soochna samay se nahin pahunchi or wo document kii jaanch nahin kara paaya
 His rank was 12th, even after that he remained in the job
 akaash pandeya naam kaa yah ladkaa yahaan vahaan bhatak rahaa he
 Now neither Hindu nor Muslim are coming to his work
 court main gaya he
 But this time the situation is that Akash did not get a job
 junior wireles officer kii pariksha paas karne ke baad, 12wein rank par aane ke baad bhi samay par soochna nahin milane ke kaaran naukari nahin mili
 Its examination for 51 posts took place on 18 November
 isamen ye ladkaa paas kar gaya
 Akash felt that information would come from SSC
 wo regular esemes or email check karata rahaa
 Also used to check the website periodically
 kai dinon baad akaash ne jab website dekhi to uske hosh ud gaye
 The result was out and all the dates were gone
 akaash kaa daawa he ki jab usne staff salection kamishan se artiai ke zarie soochna maangi to jawaab mila ki website par thode samay ke liye soochna di gai thi, aapako dekhnaa chahie tha ye aapaki galati he
 What does short notice mean? iske baad akaash yahaan vahaan pataa karne laga
 When asked the nearby students, they came to know that they had received an email and an SMS
 magar akaash kaa daawa he ki use na to esemes aayaa na email se soochna mili
 Even by bringing 12th rank in the restoration of 51 posts, Akash is unable to understand why this happened to him
 agar koi chook thi to kya yah itnaa bada maamla tha jise thik nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 More than half of May has passed, but do you know what the result of the CBI investigation of the Staff Selection Commission examination in the month of March has been
 media kii khabaron se pataa chalata he ki 27 march ko upi police ke special task force or dilli police ne milakar chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 Then 50 lakh rupees were also recovered from them
 iske aage kya pragati hui he, sibiai kii jaanch kis str par saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 The matter of leaking of question papers in the SSC examination throughout March was raised with great noise, because the students gathered in large numbers outside the Staff Selection Commission office for several days
 congress, bijepi or swaraj india ke netaa inke bich aate jate rahe
 On 6 March, Home Minister Rajnath Singh also ordered a CBI inquiry
 chaatro kii maang thi ki is saal 17 farvari se 22 farvari ke bich jo parikshaayen hui thim, unamem bade paimaane par prashn patr li hue hai
 The students were waiting for the report of the inquiry when the news came that the staff selection commission chairman Aseem Khurana's tenure has been extended by one year
 donon main koi sambandh nahin he basharte prashn patron ke li hone kii jaanch ho jaati
 However, there is anger among the students about this
 swaraj india ke anupam ne bayaan jari kar khurana ke kaarykaal badaye jane kii aalochana kii he
 In the first phase of the job series, we had shown that students who passed the CHSL 2015 and CGL 2016 exams are not getting the joining letter even after passing
 series ke baad kai hazaar chaatro ko jwining letters mila he? pichley hafte se sieji main assistant audit afasar ke pad par 1000 chaatro kii jwining ho rahi he
 As soon as we join, send us a message of thanks
 kaash sabake saath aisa ho jaataa
 Why many students of CHSL 2015 still have not received the joining letter
 inkaa kahana he ki kai vibhaagon ne niyukti patr to de die, chaatro ne jwine bhi kar liya magar abhi bhi kuch vibhaag aise hai jo niyukti patr nahin de rahe hai
 Address on the phone says that the appointment will be in july-august
 bataaiye agast 2017 main rigelt aayaa or ek saal lagegaa niyukti hone main
 With this, now those students are upset who have given the CGL 2016 exam, the result has come but the appointment letter is not being received
 ham jis pariksha kii baat kar rahe hai uskaa notification oktober 2016 main niklaa tha
 Advertisement was issued for 6708 posts
 postal sahaayak ke liye 3295 or eldisi ke liye 2878 pad the
 The exam goes on for two years
 naujavaanon kii ummiido ke saath aisa kyon hota he
 The Staff Selection Commission website shows that the result was released on February 16, it has been revised in May
 hamane esayssi ko jawaab ke liye email kiya he, jab aayega yaa agar aayega to dikhaaenge magar hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr system ke dhimi gati ke shikaar hote rahenge to kaise chalegaa
 These students are so timid or say that they are nervous that they cannot even make their videos
 hazaron kii sankhya main chaatr hai, inaki maang bhi jaays he phir bhi agar saamne nahin aaenge to ham dikhaaenge kaise
 Some students have sent audio recordings
 tippaniyan You viewers know that we were doing bank series continuously
 bich main chhod diya kyonki baat aage bad nahin rahi thi
 Some banks have ordered to construct toilets for women bankers
 ab itnaa vakt to ho hi chukaa he ki shauchalay ban janaa chahie
 The basic demand of bankers is also salary due to working conditions, stresses, so we wanted to look into them through these things, so we do not care about the holiday in addition to cross selling, worrying about the transfer of women bankers Doing it, whether it is a female or a male banker, not getting discharged if they fall ill or the family members get sick, all these things are also important
 hamane yah bhi dekha ki is bich kuch bankeron par hamale bhi hue
 There were also reports of suicide
 banking duniya ke bheetar kaaphi kuch acha nahin he
 On 21 May, Alok Chander, who was posted as manager at the Bank of Baroda in Arwal, Bihar, was shot dead
 unhen teen gaaliyon maari gayi
 Alok was a resident of Kutri village of Warsaliganj police station of Nawada

 Hopefully they will understand the words of hate
 naukari kii baat unke alaava koi or nahin samajhegaa

 phir bhi ham naukari series par laut rahe hai
 It is really being unfair to the youth
 jis vakt noujvaan naukari maang rahe hai, us vakt koi unki naukari kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The job is only on hoarding during elections
 ham koshish karenge ki apane simit sansadhano ke sahare ki alag-alag rajyon main phir se laut kar denkhenge ki jwining letters milane main kyon deree ho rahi he, kitni deree ho rahi he, vigyaapan nikalne ke baad pariksha main deree kyon ho rahi he, aap naujavaanon se ummid he ki primetimewithravish@gmail

 banaras kaa ek chaatr hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ke paas aayaa
 He claims that he had passed the examination of the staff selection but the information of passing did not arrive in time and he could not get the document checked
 uskaa rank 12waan tha, iske baad bhi vah naukari se rah gaya
 This boy named Akash Pandey is wandering here and there
 ab uske kaam na to hindu muslim vaale aa rahe hai na bhagwaan
 Went to court
 magar is vakt sthiti yah he ki akaash ko naukari nahin mili
 After passing the Junior Wireless Officer examination, even after coming in 12th rank, the job was not found due to not getting timely information
 51 padon ke liye isaki pariksha 18 november ko hui
 This boy passed in it
 akaash ko laga ki esayssi kii taraf se soochna aegi
 He kept checking regular SMS and email
 bich bich main website bhi check kar letaa tha
 After several days, when Akash visited the website, his senses flew away
 riselt nikal chukaa tha or sari tareekhen ja chuki thim
 Akash claims that when he asked for information through RTI from the Staff Selection Commission, he got the answer that the information was given on the website for a short time, you should have seen this is your mistake
 thode samay kii soochna kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Akash started to find here and there
 paas hue chaatro se poocha to pataa laga ki unhen email bhi aayaa tha or esemes bhi aayaa tha
 But Akash claims that he neither received an SMS nor received an email notification
 51 padon kii bahaali main 12waan rank laakar bhi akaash aaj samaj nahin paa rahaa he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 If there was a lapse, was it such a big case that it cannot be fixed
 aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked
 baharhaal is baat ko lekar chaatro main naaraazgi he
 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure
 naukari series ke pehle charan main hamane dikhaaya tha ki siechaesel 2015 or sijiel 2016 kii pariksha main paas kiye chaatro ko paas karne ke baad bhi jwining letters nahin mil rahaa he
 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
 We have emailed SSC for an answer, when it comes or if it will show, but how will thousands of students continue to fall prey to the slow pace of the system
 ye chaatr itane darpok hai yaa kah lijie ki ghabaraae hue hai ki apana video tak banaakar nahin bhej pate hai
 There are thousands of students, their demand is also valid, but if we do not come forward then we will show how
 kuch chaatro ne audio recording bheji he
 The comments aap darshakon ko pataa he ki ham lagaataar bank series kar rahe the
 Left in the middle because the thing was not moving forward
 kuch bainkon ne mahila bankeron ke liye shauchalay banane ke aadesh die hai
 Now it is already time that a toilet should be built
 kaam karne ke halaat, tanaavon ke bahaane bankeron kii mul maang selary bhi he isliye ham in baton ke zarie unke bheetar jhaank kar dekhnaa chaahate the, isliye hamaare liye cross sailing ke alaava chuttee na milanaa, mahila bankeron ke tabadale main unki chintaa kii parvaah na karnaa, mahila ho yaa purush banker, inke biimaar padane yaa ghar waalon ke biimaar padane par chuttee na milanaa, ye sab baaten bhi mahatvapurn hai
 We also noticed that some bankers were also attacked in the meantime
 khudakushi kii bhi khabaren ain

 21 may ko bihar ke araval main bank aaf baroda main manager pad par tainaat alok chander kii goli maar kar hatya kar di gai

 Please provide your number aadha se adhik may biit gaya lekin kya aapako pataa he ki march ke maheene main staff salection kamishan kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch kaa kya nateeja niklaa he
 Media reports show that on March 27, the UP Police Special Task Force and Delhi Police together arrested four people
 tab inke paas se 50 lakh rupee bhi baraamad hue the
 What progress has been made beyond this, at which stage the CBI investigation is not public information
 march bhar esayssi kii pariksha main prashn patron ke li hone kaa maamla jor shor se uthaa, wo bhi isliye ki chaatr kai dinon tak staff salection kamishan ke daftar ke baahar badi sankhya main jamaa hue
 Leaders of Congress, BJP and Swaraj India kept coming among them
 6 march ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh bhi die
 The students were demanding that a large number of question papers were leaked in the examinations that took place between February 17 and February 22 this year
 chaatr jaanch kii report kaa intazaar kar rahe the ki khabar ai ki staff salection kamishan ke chairman aseem khurana kaa kaarykaal ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 There is no relation between the two, provided the question papers are leaked
 baharhaal is baat ko lekar chaatro main naaraazgi he
 Anupam of Swaraj India has issued a statement criticizing the extension of Khurana's tenure
 naukari series ke pehle charan main hamane dikhaaya tha ki siechaesel 2015 or sijiel 2016 kii pariksha main paas kiye chaatro ko paas karne ke baad bhi jwining letters nahin mil rahaa he
 How many thousand students have joined the joining letter after the series? Since last week, 1000 students are joining the post of Assistant Audit Officer at CAG
 jaise jaise jwine karte hai, hamen shukriya kaa sandesh bhej dete hai
 i wish this had happened to everyone
 kyon abhi bhi siechaesel 2015 ke kai chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 They say that many departments have given appointment letters, students have also joined, but there are still some departments who are not giving appointment letters
 phone par pataa karne se bolte hai ki july agast main niyukti hogi
 Tell us the result came in August 2017 and it will take one year to get the appointment
 isi ke saath ab ve chaatr pareshaan hai jinhone sijiel 2016 kii pariksha di he, rigelt aa gaya he magar niyukti patr nahin mil rahaa he
 The notification for the exam we are talking about came out in October 2016
 6708 padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha
 There were 3295 posts for Postal Assistant and 2878 for LDC
 do-do saal to pariksha chalati rahati he
 Why does this happen to the expectations of young people
 staff salection kamishan kii website se pataa chalata he ki rigelt isi 16 farvari ko niklaa he, may maheene main ise rivaaiz kiya gaya he
