jaise math hota he usee tarah assam main satr hota he
 The abbot is called an authority there
 assam ke satron kii jameen par bangladeshi musalamaanon ke kabze ke kaaran naaraazgi badi he
 Officials have also expressed their displeasure over the targeting of the Sangh
 dhai sau satradhikaron ne parivartan kii baat kahi thi
 Devotion, dance, music teaching, training runs in these sessions
 sangh ko chunauti dene vaale yaa sangh mukt bharat kii baat karne waalon ko kya sangh ke is dhaanche or kaaryakartaaon kii patibaddhta kaa ilm he
 It is not that this foundation of the Sangh always gives BJP victory but if the fight is to fight the Sangh then what is the preparation of the fighters
 is baar 250 satradhikaron yani dharmik mathadhish parivartan kii baat chalaane lage
 The series of devotees associated with these monasteries weakened the Congress base within
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya congress kabhi in satradhikaron ke jariye naram hindutv kii raajnneeti karti thi
 When we asked this question that it is so powerful, why couldn't we first make a change in bjp's favor
 iske jawaab main yah bataaya gaya ki bangladeshi musalamaanon ke prati congress sarkaar kii sahansheeltaa se log aajiz aa gaye the or sangh ko target kiye jane se yah naaraaz ho gaye
 The BJP continued to raise the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims at the national level, but it could not make it to Assam
 is bich badaruddin ajmal kii party ban gai or lagaataar siten jeetne lagi
 This time Ajmal himself has lost the election, defeating Congress candidate Wajid Ali Chaudhary by 16,723 votes
 agar congress isi tarah ajmal ko saamne se chunauti detii to us par muslim sampradayikta ke poshan kaa aarope nahin lagata
 Experts say that Ajmal encouraged Muslim communalism, in response to which the Congress was forced to move towards soft Hindutva
 lekin yahi ajmal 2009 main upie ko baahar se samarthan bhi de rahe the
 If the Congress had been serious about Hindutva-based communalism, it would have also fought Muslim communalism
 haalanki ajmal kehete hai ki unki party sirf musalamaanon kii party nahin hai
 Also gives tickets to people of other religions
 ab sangh kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kii pahchaan kar unhen baahar bhejnaa hoga
 Will the BJP really identify and remove Muslims on such a large scale? sangh kii maane to is aadhaar par uski sarkaar kii pariksha honi he
 BJP fielded 9 Muslim candidates, only two could win
 jammu-kashmir main sabase adhik musalmaan hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 Thereafter in Assam, there is a BJP government
 tippaniyan In Assam, the Bharatiya Janata Party has also dispelled the myth of the Muslim vote
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kaha jaataa tha ki upi main itani siten muslim bahul hai
 Even after this, BJP won more than 70 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 upi main virdohi dalon ke alag ladane se laabh mila jaise assam main mila
 In Assam too, if Congress and AUDF were to fight together, the vote percentage of both would be higher than BJP
 congress ne na to ajmal ko khulkar chunauti di na hi haath milaayaa
 You can gauge the strength of Muslim votes in Assam from the fact that once the Maulana Asad Madni of Jamiat Ulema Hind had said that the Congress government was toppled if its 18 demands were not met
 aaj assam main jo sarkaar ban rahi he usamen na to ajmal kaa asar he na madani kaa
 The BJP weakened the electoral strength of the Muslim vote by its strategy
 assam kii jeet bijepi ke liye badi he
 The Prime Minister is being welcomed in the Assam tradition at the BJP headquarters
 jab pradhanmantri banakar narendra modi bijepi daftar main aae the tab unhone devdas apte kaa naam liya tha
 This is the same Apte who went to Assam from Nagpur in 1963 as a Jan Sangh pracharak
 jab pradhanmantri apane raajnneetik prashikshan ke daur main dilli aae the tab apte ji hi bijepi mukhyalay ke incharge the
 Nana ji took Deshmukh Apte from Awadh Tirhut Mail to Assam
 apte ji abhi 80 saal ke hai lekin 24 saal kii umr main assam gaye the
 When he spoke to Apte, he told that it took a long time to convince Assam about the issue of Bangladeshi Muslims
 apte ji ne 1964 main anti infiltreshan cameti banaai
 The capital of Assam was then Shillong
 vahaan kii librari se sensos kii report lekar aae
 Praja Socialist Party MLA Madhusudan Das was associated with this issue
 apte ji is jeet par khush hai
 The Sangh is not involved in this scene of victory but it is not his victory
 uske apano kii hi khushi he
 There is no such institution in India that has so many schools in one state
 koi privet sanstha bhi sangh se is maamle main match nahin kar sakati he
 In Assam alone, there are about twelve hundred and fifty branches of the Sangh at this time
 sangh kii ek or sanstha yahaan kaaphi kaam karti he jiskaa naam he seva bharti
 It was found in the conversation that seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work
 inhen swasthya rakshak kaha jaataa he
 The union gives them training in homeopathy and natural medicine which also becomes the means of their employment
 sangh 14 saal se har saal aath dinon kii ghanavantari seva yatra nikaalata he
 About 200 MBBS doctors are brought from all over the country
 inaki team aath-aath dinon tak alag-alag ilaake main camp lagaati he
 And a truck medicine is distributed among the poor by asking people
 sangh kaaryakarta ne bataaya ki ham logon ko apni vichaardhaara or seva se prabhavit karte hai
 Whoever wants to vote never says, but if someone in politics turns upside down, then it is our job to keep an eye on him
 tamaam sansthaaon se jude pandrah bees hajaar kaaryakarta chunaavon ke samay apni jimmedaari khud samaj jate hai
 Especially when their organization is abused, then they will never vote on the side that causes abuse
 isi baatcheet main ek dilachasp baat yah pataa chali ki is baar assam ke satradhikaar kaaphi naaraaz the
 As there is a monastery, so is the session in Assam
 mathadhish ko vahaan satradhikaar kehete hai
 Resentment has increased due to the occupation of Bangladeshi Muslims on the land of Sessions of Assam
 satradhikaron ne bhi sangh ko target kiye jane se naaraazgi jataai he
 Two hundred and fifty officers had talked about change
 in satron main bhakthi, nrity, sangeet kaa shikshan, prashikshan chalata he
 Do those who challenge the Sangh or talk about a Sangh-mukt Bharat, have the conviction of the Sangh's structure and the commitment of the workers
 aisa nahin he ki sangh kaa yah aadhaar hameshaa bijepi ko jeet hi dilaa detaa he lekin agar sangh se ladanaa he to ladane waalon kii taiyaari kya he
 This time 250 magistrates, ie religious monks, started talking about change
 in mathon se jude bhakton kii shrinkhalaa ne congress ke aadhaar ko bheetar hi bheetar kamjor kar diya
 Now it has to be seen whether the Congress ever used the politics of soft Hindutva through these authorities
 hamane jab yah sawaal poocha ki yah itane hi taqatvar hai to pehle kyon nahin bijepi ke paksh main badlaav kara sake
 In response to this, it was told that the Congress government's tolerance towards Bangladeshi Muslims was disenchanted and it angered the target of the Sangh
 bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa mudda bijepi rashtriya str par uthaati rahi lekin isse assam main vah jagah nahin bana saki
 Meanwhile, Badruddin became Ajmal's party and continued to win seats
 is baar ajmal khud chunaav haar gaye hai, unhen congress ke ummidavaar waajid ali choudhary ne 16,723 maton se haraa diya he
 If the Congress had similarly challenged Ajmal from the front, he would not have been accused of nurturing Muslim communalism
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ajmal ne muslim sampradayikta ko badhaava diya jisaki pratikriya main congress naram hindutv kii taraf jane ko majaboor hui
 But the same Ajmal was also supporting the UPA in 2009 from outside
 congress agar hindutv aadhaarit sampradayikta ke prati gambhir hoti to muslim sampradayita se bhi sangharsh karti
 However, Ajmal says that his party is not just a party of Muslims
 duusare dharmon ke logon ko bhi tikat detii he
 Now the Sangh says that the BJP government will have to identify and send out Bangladeshi Muslims
 kya vaaki bijepi itane bade str par musalamaanon kii pahchaan karegi or nikaalane kaa kaam karegi
 If the Sangh believes, its government will have to be tested on this basis
 bijepi ne 9 muslim ummidavaar utaare the, do hi jeet sake
 Jammu and Kashmir has the most Muslims, there is a BJP government
 uske baad assam main hai, vahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The comments assam main bhartiya janata party ne muslim vot ke myth ko bhi dhwast kar diya he
 During the Lok Sabha elections it was said that there are so many Muslim majority seats in UP
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne 70 se adhik loksabhaa siten upi main jeet leen
 Separate fighting of opposing parties in UP benefited as it did in Assam
 assam main bhi congress or eudief milakar ladate to donon kaa mat pratishat bijepi se adhik hota
 The Congress neither openly challenged or shook Ajmal
 assam main muslim maton kii takat kaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki ek baar jamiyat ulema hind ke moulana asad madani ne apni 18 maangen puri na hone par congress kii sarkaar hi gira dene kii baat kah di thi
 Neither Ajmal nor Madani has influence in the government that is being formed in Assam today
 muslim vot kii chunavi takat ko bijepi ne apni ranneeti se kamjor kar diya
 Assam's victory is big for BJP
 bijepi mukhyalay main assam kii parampara main pradhanmantri kaa swaagat ho rahaa he
 When Narendra Modi came to the BJP office as Prime Minister, he took the name of Devdas Apte
 yah vahi apte hai jo nagpur se 1963 main jansangh ke prachaarak banakar assam gaye the
 When Prime Minister came to Delhi during his political training, Apteji was the incharge of BJP headquarters
 naanaa ji deshmukh apte ji ko avadh tirhut mail se assam le gaye
 Apte ji is now 80 years old but went to Assam at the age of 24 years
 apte ji se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki lanbaa vakt lag gaya assam ko bangladeshi musalamaanon kaa masalaa samajhane main
 Apte ji formed the Anti Infiltration Committee in 1964
 tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 They brought the census report from the library there
 praja socialist party ke vidhayak madhusudan das ko is masale se jod diya
 Apte ji is happy with this victory

 uskaa kahana he ki ram or krishna ke janmasthalon vaale is aadhyatmik pradesh main sharaab kaa kaarobaar puri tarah band hona chahie
 Maulana Tauqir Raza Khan, president of the ittehad-e-millat Council, which is a bugle organization against alcohol, said that drinking alcohol has been called bad in almost all religions and Uttar Pradesh is a spiritual state for both Hindus and Muslims
 is rajya main to sharabkhori par puri tarah pratibandh laganaa chahie
 He said that Uttar Pradesh is the head of all the states of the country, so the echo of the message emanating from here will be heard the farthest

 Referring to Gujarat, he said that when alcoholism can be banned at Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace, then why cannot it be in the territory of Lord Ram and Krishna
 islam main to sharaab ko har buraai kii jad mana gaya he
 Maulana said that it is very difficult to ban Kishrab completely, but campaigning against it can definitely stop the access of alcohol to minors
 unhone kaha 'main to saarvajanik manch se kah chukaa hum ki musalamaanon kii vajah se sharaab mahangi ho gai hai or hinduon kii vajah se maance kii keemten bad gayi hai
 If liquor is banned, heinous crimes like murder, rape and robbery can be prevented

 Maulana said that the council will launch a campaign against alcoholism after the panchayat elections in the state
 is abhiyaan ko abhi isliye nahin shuru kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki isse yah raajnneetik rang le saktaa he
 He said that he will also campaign to demand widespread irregularities in meat trade and curbing arbitrariness

 At the same time, in its report on the last Shukrawar in Parliament, the CAG said that if the war breaks out, then the Indian Army does not even have enough gala to fight the war for 10 days
 pakistan or china ke saath kai morchon par jari tanaav ke bich ai yah report bhartiya sena kii sthiti ko kamjor karata he
 The CAG in its report has blamed the Ordnance Factory Board for this shortage of ammunition with the Indian Army
 haalanki is killat ke liye kai duusare kaarak maane ja rahe hai
 How did such a shortage of ammunition happen? In this report, the CAG said that despite the concern expressed by the central auditor in 2015 and the preparation of a high-level report on defense preparedness, the working of the aging factories No improvement was noted
 kaig kii report main kaha gaya ki golabarood kii nirmaan or supplai quality or quantity donon hi maamalon main kharaab rahaa
 Such a large number of soldiers is also one of the reasons why Indian Army is the third largest army in the world, which has more than 1
3 million soldiers
 sainikon kii itani badi sankhya kii vajah se hathiyaaron or golabarood kaa stock banaae rakhana mushkil ho jaataa he
 At the same time, there is a problem of maintenance of ammunition in large quantities in military installations
 aam taur par goliyon or golon ko acchhee tarah se rakhaa jaae, to vah dashakon tak sahi rahete hai
 But storing large quantities of ammunition causes such quality to deteriorate and cause problems during use

 Defense experts say that due to the antiquated practices of red tape and bureaucracy, the defense sector has been facing obstacles year after year
 vahiin ek report ke mutabik, isi lalaphitaashahee kii vajah se saal 2008 or 2013 ke bich lakshith seemaa kaa mahaj 20 fisadi gola-barood hi aayaat ho paaya
 Make in India became road, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's emphasis on Make in India initiative for the defense procurement was also considered as a reason
 is mahatvakankshi yojana ke tahat piem modi ne saal 2014 main hathiyaaron or gola-barood kaa aayaat kam karte hue bharat main inkaa nirmaan badhaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The initiative of the Prime Minister was well appreciated, but in this too, red tape showed to be a bottleneck

 Reacting to reports of differences in the Indian team in the Safarnamedia of 'nawab of Najafgarh', Srinivasan said that he has asked the media manager and the board need not be worried about anything
 shrinivasana ne yahaan ipel sanchaalan parishad kii baithak ke baad kaha, ‘aapako isaki koi jaankaree nahin he

 'he said,' He was answering such questions in the press conference
 yah prayek match ke baad hota he
 i talked to the media manager there
 mujhe lagata he ki reporton ko badha chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya he
 BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, special on Mahendra Singh Dhoni, also denied reports of differences in the team
 unhone kaha, ‘sahvagaka bayaan tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya he
 This is what we came to know
 team main koi matbhed nahin he
 This is speculation by the media
 mujhe nahin lagata ki koi samasya he
 The BCCI is in constant touch with the team
 ’roteshan pranali ne kaaphi vivaad khadaa kar diya he, iske bare main poochne par shukla ne kaha, ‘antim ekadash kaa faisla team prabandhan karata he jisamen manager, captain or coach shaamil hai
 The team management has adopted the rotation system for only three openers, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, after which reports of differences are coming
 sabase pehle matbhed kii baat tab khulkar saamne aayi jab gambhir ne match jaldi khatm nahin karne ke liye mahendra singh dhoni kii aalochana kii lekin captain ne ise raay main bhinnata qaraar karte hue nakaar diya
 Dhoni publicly blamed the fielding abilities of the three players and said that these three are not being fed together as they are slow fielders which could cause the team to lose an extra 20 runs
 iske baad sahvaag ne kaha ki seniyaron ko kabhi nahin bataaya gaya ki kshetrarakshan hi roteshan pranali ke istemaal kaa kaaran he
 Senior players resorted to press conferences for comments against each other and the literal war between them could not escape the eyes of the media, which has consistently written about the poor performance of the players

 In the all-party meeting to be held on Friday with the Election Commission, the issue of evms will remain in place
 iviem mashin ko lekar sabase aakraamak rukh aam aadmi party apnayegi
 Saurabh Bhardwaj, who participates in this meeting on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party, will demand in the meeting that a committee be formed to conduct an in-depth examination of the EVM machine which includes people from all parties
 lekin iviem mashin ke sawaal par baaki vipakshi partiyon se aam aadmi party ko aadha-adhuraa samarthan hi milegaa
 Parties like Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party will stand with the Aam Aadmi Party on the EVM machine
 congress kuch had tak iviem kaa sawaal uthaaegi
 But, it will not adopt an aggressive attitude about it
 congress kii taraf se is baithak main vivek tankhaa, deepak amin or vipul maheshwari shaamil honge
 But parties like the Left parties and Janata Dal United are clearly saying that they do not consider it right to hold the EVM machine responsible for the election results
 haalanki paper trail vaali iviem mashin laane par zyaadaatar partiyon kii sahmati he
 In Friday's all-party meeting, the Election Commission is also going to put two such proposals in front of the parties, which can be changed if the consensus is reached
 chunaav ayog vot ko prabhavit karne ke liye rishwat dene ke aparaadh ko cognijeble offence yani sangyeya aparaadh banane kii maang karegaa
 This means that the police can arrest anyone without a warrant on charges of bribing
 chunaav ayog ye bhi maang karegaa ki bade paimaane par rishwat kii shikaayat aane par kisi seat par chunaav radd karne kaa adhikaar bhi use mili
 At present, the Election Commission has the right to cancel the election only if the booth is looted
 chunaav ayog partiyon ke saamne jo duusari maang rakhega agar vah puri ho jaati he to chunaav kii tasviir kaaphi kuch badal jaaegi or kai netaa raajnneeti main darkinar ho jaaenge
 The Election Commission will propose that a leader should contest the election only after the charges are framed by the court
 maujuuda kanoon ke hisaab se kisi netaa ke chunaav ladane par tabhi pabandi lagati he jab adaalat use doshi ghoshit kar de
 The Election Commission believes that if the election is banned only after the charges are framed, then the election will be very clean because many times the leaders with criminal image keep taking advantage of prolonged litigation
 in donon prastaavon ko lekar partiyon kii raay alag-alag he
 CPM leader Prakash Karat says that the Election Commission should be empowered to cancel the election if the bribe is given because it has become common practice to bribe for votes
 lekin sirf aarope tay ho jane par chunaav ladane par roak lagane ke vah khilaaf hai
 The CPM will argue in the meeting that if this happens, the ruling party can get them out of the election by falsely prosecuting the leaders of the opposition before the election
 janata dal united kii taraf se sarvadaleey baithak main bhaag lene ja rahe kasee tyaagi kaa kahana he ki chunaav ayog ke donon prastaavon kaa unki party baithak main samarthan karegi
 All the parties keep accusing each other of bribing voters
 lekin iske aadhaar par chunaav radd karne kaa adhikaar chunaav ayog ko dene ke liye partiyaan taiyaar hogi yaa nahin kahana mushkil he
 Prohibition of contesting elections on filing of charge sheet is one such proposal which can hardly be agreed
 kyonki argedy jaise kai aise dal hai jin ke bade netaa mukademon main fanse hue hai
 In this all-party meeting, the Election Commission will also decide how to open the challenge to hack the EVM machine and the date for it

 When you are in a romantic relationship with someone, you never think about her break up and neither do you want to
 aap rishte main aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 You have a lot of expectations from that relationship
 aap apane partner kii ankhon main apana bhavishya dekhne lagate hai or aapaki ankhen gulabi sapane bunane main mashgool ho jaati hai
 But if you are in a relationship that is slowly hurting you, will you ever realize this? Keeping these 10 things in mind, you will be able to decide that it is time to go ahead and end the relationship right here
 Gone: That spark no longer: You don't know why you are in this relationship? Now neither romance is left between you two nor is there any idea of chemistry and companionship
 or aap donon bina kisi khaas vajah ke ek-duusare kii jindagi main maujuud hai
 Sometimes silently you also think that you are both together
 aapako chot pahunch rahi he:aapako har vakt galat samajha ja rahaa he, aapako chot pahunchaai ja rahi he or aap gusse main hai
 Sometimes you don't even know why this is happening and you just think that your partner is hurting or bothering you
 ghar kii murgi daal baraabar:aapkaa partner aapako yuj kar rahaa he
 Is using your wise behavior cleverly and understands you no matter how good you are with him
 aap is ummid main sabakuch sahan karte ja rahe hai ki ek din aapke saathi ko aapke nishchal pyaar kaa ehsaas ho jayega or wo ek din badalakar aapke paas laut aayega
 No idea of the future: You are satisfied with your relationship and are happy too
 lekin jab bhi aap akele hote hai to aap yah dekhne kii koshish karte hai ki aakhir aap donon kaa rishta ja kahaan rahaa he
 Your mind says that there is no future for your relationship
 aap behatar kal ko dekhne kii chaahe kitni bhi koshish kyun na kar len, lekin aap apane lover ko long turm partner ke taur par nahin dekh pate
 How far are the distances too: Your partner is not interested in playing an important and active role in your life, nor did he ever try to understand your life properly
 aapaki jindagi main wo bhaavnaatmak rup se shaamil nahin hai or nadaarad hai
 Sex life: You don't even remember when was the last time both of you were lost in love moments
 aap bedroom main phir se jaan daalane kii puri koshish kar rahe hai, lekin aapke saathi karavat badalakar bed ke duusare kone main sona pasand karte hai
 And then you feel very bad when both of you are going and your partner praises other girls on the way
 vishwaas kii kami:ab aapako apane saathi par jaraa bhi vishwaas nahin
 Maybe there is a solid reason for this belief or maybe when it comes to trusting you both may have different expectations from each other
 lekin jab tak aap rishte main ai silavaton ko dur nahin karenge tab tak pyaar dhundhala hota jayega or phir ek din gaayab hi ho jayega
 Then the same three parts of Dhaka happen every time
 pehle bahut sara pyaar or phir badi takaraar
 After this, the two of you interact with each other and then a big debate ends with love
 or agali baar phir yahi hota he
 Do jisma, do jaan: You feel that you love your partner a lot and you are happy in this relationship
 lekin, aap donon bas saath main rah rahe hai or aap donon main kuch bhi ek jaisaa nahin
 Compliment on compliment: Your partner puts his full strength in impressing someone, but he never does anything for you
 sammaan:kya aap apane partner kii izzat karte hai? kya aapke saathi aapako sammaan dete hai? ek safal rishte main ek-duusare ko izzat dena behad jaruri he
 If there is no respect for each other, then understand that there is no future for this relationship

 To overcome the shortage of water in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has prepared a plan to adopt foreign technology
 dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki rashtriya rajdhani dilli main jald hi singapore kii tarj par siver kaa pani saaf kiya jayega
 Kejriwal is also the chairman of the Delhi Jal Board
 ab wo din dur nahin, jab dilli main siver ke trited pani ko dobaaraa treet kar gharelu istemaal ke liye supplai kiya jayega
 On the lines of Singapore, the Kejriwal government has also decided to treat the water in the sewage treatment plant in Delhi to take care of the water problem
 dilli jal board ne is plan par kaam karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 The government has hoped that in the next two years, 15 to 20 percent water availability in Delhi will be increased through STP
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne buraadi main ban rahe 70 mjidi ke sivej treetment plant kaa jayja liya
 This plant is very important for Delhi Jal Board, because through it the government is also going to do a new experiment
 is plant se rojaanaa treet hue pani ko yamuna main choda jayega
 The water will be released in the part of Yamuna from where Yamuna enters Delhi, after which treated water will reach Yamuna water along with Yamuna and then the same water from Wazirabad will be used for Chandrawal and Wazirabad plant
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne yah bhi kaha ki bhavishya main rithala plant se pehle 80 mjidi pani treet kar pallaa tak pahunchane kii yojana he
 According to the Aam Aadmi Party government, 900 MGD water is prepared daily in Delhi at present, but due to lack of its source, there is still a shortage of water in many areas
 ab sarkaar ne alag-alag madhyam se agle do saal main 15 se 20 fisadi or paanch saal main 50 fisadi tak pani main badhotaree kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 This is the government's plan to treat the increased water - 50 MGD in Dwarka and 130 MGD plant in Chandrawal
 - uttar pradesh se aane vaali kachi nahar ko pakkaa kiya jayega
 This will save 150 MGD of water
 - dilli ke 36 anya STP ke pani kaa istemaal badhaayaa jayega
 200 new ponds will be built in Delhi and attention will also be given to the beauty of these ponds
 - pallaa main 10 MGD pani ke liye 70 se zyada boring lagavaaye jaaenge
 - Rain water harvesting system will be improved by next year
 - jin ilaakon main pani kii samasya zyada he, vahaan kii ek list taiyaar kii gai he
 CM Arvind Kejriwal claimed that after the launch of these schemes, the amount of water in Delhi will increase by 50 per cent
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki yamuna safai ko lekar bhi naalon main interceptor lagane kaa kaam kareeb-kareeb puraa ho gaya he, jiske baad yamuna main gande naale kaa pani nahin daalaa jayega
 Under this, the small drains that go to Najafgarh drain will be surveyed so that not a single drain is connected to the Najafgarh drain

 The Kejriwal government of Delhi has received a major setback in the matter of making 21 mlas as parliamentary secretaries
 guuruuvaar ko dilli hai court ne dilli sarkaar dwaara 21 sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti ko radd kar diya
 Significantly, the Delhi government, through its order of 13 March 2015, made 21 party mlas as parliamentary secretaries
 jise adaalat main chunauti di gai thi
 The Delhi High Court said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appointed the 21 Parliamentary Secretaries of Delhi Government without the approval of the Lieutenant Governor and hence they are deemed to be unconstitutional
 court ne kaha ki dilli centre shasit pradesh he
 The court said that under Article 239AA it is necessary to obtain the approval of the Lieutenant Governor for making such appointment
 hai court ne kaha ki pichley maheene hamane uparajyapal auradilli sarkaarake adhikaron ko lekar apana faisla suna diya he
 Based on that, these appointments are illegal
 court ne is maamle main kejariwal sarkaar ke march 2015 ke us notification ko hi radd kar diya jisamen 21 sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti kii gai thi
 The Lieutenant Governor can complain: The High Court also said in this case that the Central Government, through the Governor, can decide what action can be taken in this matter
 agar uparajyapal chahen to 21 sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti par ab tak kharch hue sarkari paise kii recovery kar sakate hai
 Also, no action can be taken for not taking their approval
 lekin court iskaa adhikaar uparajyapal ko diya he
 The order of the court which came after the appointment, Delhi government also admitted that the approval of the Lieutenant Governor was not taken in this case
 sarkaar ne ye bhi kaha ki 21 sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti march 2015 main kii thi or hai court kaa aadesh pichley maheene aayaa he
 This petition was filed by the National President of Rashtriya Mukti Morcha Ravinder Kumar in the High Court last year and said that no state government can appoint parliamentary secretaries more than 10 percent
 yani 70 vidhayakon me se sirf saat ko hi parliamentry secretary ke taur par niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, their appointment should be canceled
 chunaav ayog ke paas bhi abhi ye maamla vichaaradhin he

 Despite this, the final decision on Kumaraswamy cabinet has not been done
 is bich congress ke saamne kal hone vaale shapath-grahan samaaroh se pehle teen pramukh chunautiyaan munh-baayen khadi hai, jo party ke sheersh netritv ke liye chintaa kaa sabab bani he
 First challenge: The biggest challenge before the Congress leadership is that its strength can be seen during the swearing-in
 aisa isliye kyonki 78 siton ke saath congress duusari sabase badi party he or vah jedies (38 seat) se kaaphi aage he
 Despite this, the Congress has given the post of CM to JDS and is seen standing in the role of junior himself
 aise main mishan 2019 ke saath aage bad rahe congress haikaman bhale hi yah tasviir raas aa jaae, lekin sthaneey netritv or congress vidhayakon ke liye ise pachaa paanaa utana aasaan nahin hoga
 Second challenge: However, till now it is being revealed that the formula for 20 ministership for Congress and 14 for JDS has been prepared, but no official announcement has been made
 aise main congress ke 78 vidhayakon main se mantrimandal kii chaah rakhane vaale vidhayakon ko ekajute rakhana bhi congress netritv ke liye badi chintaa kaa vishay he
 In today's meeting, if a decision is taken on the cabinet, it can take a more serious problem before the eclipse tomorrow (wednesday)

 As such MB Patil, Deshpande, D

 In such a situation, the resentment of two-three mlas can also give a big blow to the congress-jds alliance and a golden chance for the BJP which has suffered in the house

 In a major decision, the government has now included the unmarried, widowed and divorced daughters of the employees and pensioners before January 1, 2006 in the family pension eligibility list of employees and pensioners
 ek janvari 2006 va uske baad ke liye yah vyavastha pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 While implementing the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, the government had decided to include unmarried, widowed and divorced daughters in the eligibility list of family pension of employees and pensioners
 pehle patni va anya sharton ke anusaar parivaar ke duusare sadasyon ko fimali pension kii vyavastha thi
 The government had ordered the names of such daughters of employees and pensioners after January 1, 2006 to be included in the eligibility list, but pre-2006 employees and pensioners were not included in that order

 In the last Lok Sabha elections, some questions were raised about the role of the Election Commission from the day of voting to counting
 aarope lage ki ayog ne vipakshi partiyon ko barabari kaa mauka nahin diya
 This raised many questions on the commission's credibility during the entire election process
 jin muddon ko lekar chunaav ayog par aarope lage unamem model code of conduct (adarsh aachaar samhita) kaa sahi se paalan na karnaa, iviem ke rakh rakhaav or vipakshi partiyon par inakam tex or idi ke chaape shaamil hai
 On many occasions, the resentment was so high that the Supreme Court itself had to interfere and former President Pranab Mukherjee was required to remind the Election Commission that it would uphold the integrity of the institution
 bhartiya loktantr ko akshunn rakhane ke liye nishpaksh chunaav karwaane main chunaav ayog kii bhoomika ahm he
 The new government will have to immediately consider accepting the long-standing demands for significant changes in the constitution and functioning of the Commission
 chayan kii prakriya ko or vyapak karnasanvidhan kii dhara 324 chunaav ayog ko ye adhikaar detii he ki wo chunaav kii prakriya kaa nirdesan kare, saath hi ye ek swatantra sanstha kii tarah kaam kare jisamen vidhayika kaa koi dakhal na ho
 Also, the government should appoint the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioner on this basis
 "chunaav ayog main mukhya chunaav ayukta or chunaav ayuktaon kii niyukti samay-samay par raashtrapati dwaara hoti he
 Changes in their appointments should be done by the President after the approval of Parliament
 "2015 kii lau kamishan kii report bataati he ki samvidhan sabha main mukhya chunaav ayukta or chunaav ayukta kii niyuktiyon ko lekar bahes hui jisamen raay di gai ki is tarah kii niyuktiyon ko sansad main do tihaai bahumat se paas karaayaa jaae
 However, the joint session of Parliament rejected the proposal and gave Parliament the authority to pass legislation on the matter
 aazaadee ke 70 saal bitne ke baad bhi is tarah kaa koi kanoon nahin banaaya gaya
 Every time the government has been appointing Election Commission officers as per its choice, while the truth is that many committees and commissions, the Law Ministry and the Election Commission itself have demanded that the appointment of Commission officials be bipartisan, with discussion And in a more transparent way
 1990 main goswami cameti ne kaha tha ki mukhya chunaav ayukta ko raashtrapati, mukhya nyaayadhish or netaa vipaksh kii raay se niyukt karen
 In this way, the opinion of the Chief Election Commissioner should also be taken in the appointment of other Election Commissioners and the whole process should be legalized
 is bare main 1990 main sanshodhan draft taiyaar bhi hua, lekin baad main use waapas le liya gaya
 a similar arrangement was made in the 2007 report of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa spikar, netaa vipaksh, kanoon mantri or rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ko milakar chunaav ayukta chunanaa tha magar ye vyavastha bhi fail ho gai
 In 2015, the Law Commission proposed three member collegiums in which the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Chief Justice make such appointments
 aaiye ab dekhte hai ki videshon main aisi niyuktiyaan kaise hoti hai
 In the US, the Federal Election Commissioner elects the President in which the Senate's opinion is taken
 canada main house of kaaman kii raay par ayukta chune jate hai, jabaki dakshin africa main ye chunaav neshnal assembly ke jariye hota he
 In India also, the election of Lokpal, Lokayukta, CEC, and Information Commissioner, CBI Director and CVC is done the same way
 isse pehle chunaav ayog kii takat ko kisi ne nahin pahachaanaa jab tien sheshan chunaav ayukta bane to unhone ayog ko ek majboot or swatantra sanstha kaa rup de diya tha, lekin philhal vaise halaat nahin dikhte
 Like the Chief Election Commissioner, the process of removing the Election Commissioners cannot be removed easily, even the Election Commissioners, Section 324 (5) gives protection to the Chief Election Commissioner like a judge of the Supreme Court, but it is not so about the Election Commissioner , They work on the will of the government or the will of the Chief Election Commissioner
 code of conduct ke maamle main kuch netaaon ko clin chit dene ke masale par pichley dinon siisi sunil aroda or chunaav ayukta ashok lavasa ke bich saarvajanik matbhed ye bataate hai ki chunaav ayuktaon ko bhi sanvaidhanik suraksha milani chahie
 Permanent Staff Election to the Commission: The Commission should also get a permanent and independent secretariat which defends its staff, all the senior officers of the Commission are drawn from the Civil Services
 zyaadaatar duusare pradeshon se hote hai or sirf depyutesan par aate hai
 Only lower level employees are permanent
 duusari swytt sansthaaon kii tarah lambey samay se ayog kii maang rahi he ki unki apni bhartee honi chahie
 Parliament has the right to form a recruitment board and commission
 1990 main rajyasabha main aisi koshish kii bhi gai, lekin 1993 main ise waapas le liya gaya jab chunaav ayog ko 3 sadasyeey cameti main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 However, the time has come to revisit it once again
 bihar main endie sarkaar ke gathan main or lalu -rabadi shashan ke khatme main purv vit mantri arun jetali kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 After his death, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced on Saturday that apart from laying his life-size statue in Patna, his birthday will be celebrated as a state function
 shanivaar ko patna main endie kii ore se ek shradhanjali sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 On this occasion, Nitish Kumar while discussing his role in the formation of the NDA government in Bihar said that he had a special relationship with him, especially when he became the BJP in-charge of Bihar and two elections were held in the assembly, no one forgot him
 can
 nitish ne kaha ki vipareet paristhiti main halaat ko sanbhaalane main arun jetali kii tulana prakhyat samaajawaadee madhu dandavate se kii
 The CM of Bihar said that even though he was not a resident of Bihar, his love and harmony towards Biharis was more
 virodhiyon se bhi jo samvaad karne kii kala arun jetali main thi
 Apart from this, talking openly and despite his poor health did not show any effect on his memory and neither did he look upset
 jiesti par arun jetali ke saath apane anubhav kii charchaa karte hue bihar ke urja mantri bijendra yadav ne kaha ki ye unke prayaason kaa fal he ki jiesti counsil main kabhi kisi bhi vishay par voting nahin hui or sabhi baton kaa samaadhaan charchaa kar nikaala gaya
 At the same time, RCP Singh of Janata Dal said that in order to pay real tribute to him, a resolution should be taken by securing a larger mandate in the next year's assembly elections from 2010

 Because many mlas are running dissatisfied with the Kamal Nath government at this time
 congress ke paanch vidhayak mantri na banane ke kaaran asantusht hai
 If sources are to be believed, these mlas have also met Amit Shah during the Lok Sabha elections
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad basapa or sapa ke vidhayak bhi paala badalakar bijepi ke saath aa sakate hai
 In such a situation, the BJP is trying to oust the Kamal Nath government by running the floor test

 Indian hockey captain Sardar Singh threatened legal action against the woman who accused him of sexual harassment
 sardaar ne daawa kiya ki is mahila ne unke soshal media acount kaa galat istemaal kiya
 Sardar, the captain of the Punjab Warriors team currently playing in the Hockey India League, said that as soon as he gets the documents related to this woman's complaint, he will give a proper answer to these allegations
 haryana police main dspi pad par kabiz sardaar ne doharaaya ki shikaayat karne vaali mahila or vah mahaj ‘achche mitra’ hai
 In a press conference held at Sector 42 Stadium here, he said, 'my entire focus is on hockey
 ye jo aarope lagaaye gaye hai, wo galat hai
 When the report comes, i will see if legal action can be taken
 ’ sarkaar ke saath unke vakil bhi the, ‘unhen is mahila se rishte or uske dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon ke bare main bhi kaaphi sawaal puche gaye
 The midfielder also dismissed allegations that he had forced the woman to undergo an abortion last year
 unhone kaha, ‘is tarah kii koi cheez nahin hui
 i have learned this from you only
 jab report aegi or aglaa kadam kya hoga, main aapako suchit kar duungaa
 'this woman had alleged that Sardar refused to marry her
 yah poochne par ki kya unki is mahila se sagaai hui thi to unhone kaha, ‘dekhie, pichhali baar jab main spain main khel rahaa tha, usne mere email dekhe or password nikaal liya
 Some tweets were also misused

 ' bhartiya cricket board kii haalat ye he ki uske koshadhyaksh aniruddh choudhary ke paas teen daftar hai
 His Delhi office runs from an expensive suite at the seven-star Hotel Maurya Sheraton, with the BCCI spending 40 lakhs on two rooms
 is hotel kaa kiraaya ek saal kaa karodon main he
 This information has been extracted by Aditya Verma of Bihar who went to the Supreme Court against Srinivasan and finally Srinivasan had to leave the BCCI chair
 yadi aditya verma kii baat ko sahi maane to aniruddh choudhary ne adam chadvik ko bisisiai ke museum samiti kaa sadsy banaaya, jiske liye ek badi dhan raashi conslatesan fees ke taur par lee gai
 Adam Chadwick is also the curator of MCC
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa duun ki bisisiai ke koshadyaksh kaa daftar pune or chennai main bhi he, haalanki bisisiai ke sabhi padaadhikari avaitnaik hote hai
 But this milch board is not short of money and people take advantage of it
 aditya verma ke aaropon kii list kaaphi lambii he, unka kahana he ki pehle board ne bengalore kii neshnal cricket academy ko bhang kar diya or ab board ke adhikari jaise ratnakar shetty or aniruddh choudhary duniyabar ke bordon main gum rahe hai ki neshnal cricket academy kaa sahi blue print kya hona chahie? These officials have visited England, Australia and South Africa
 darasal, aniruddh choudhary ko shrinivasana camp kaa mana jaataa he
 His father Ranveer Mahindra has also been the President of BCCI
 ve haryana main congress ke vidhayak bhi rah chuke hai or aniruddh ke dada bansi laal haryana ke mukhyamantri bhi rah chuke hai, haalanki aniruddh choudhary apane upar lage sabhi aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataate hai
 He says that not much has been spent on the decoration of his office
 tippaniyan Chaudhary says that the board is financed by the Finance Committee, which also approves the Board's working committee
 saath hi aniruddh choudhary kaa yah bhi kahana he ki adam chadvik ko mujium samiti kaa sadsy shashaank manohar ke kaarykaal main banaaya gaya tha, lekin bisisiai ke ek purv adhikari ne majaak main kaha ki cricket board kaa yah haal he ki ganimat samajho aniruddh ne koshadyaksh kaa daftar bhivani main nahin kholaa, kyonki ve vahiin ke rahane vaale hai
 This has happened in the history of BCCI, when Jyoti Vajpayee became treasurer, he used to work from Kanpur and in a way the office was also there
 magar tab bisisiai kaa apana koi aadhikarik offis nahin hota tha
 Now there is an office of the board, which is in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, but where the president is there, the staff of the BCCI shifts
 jagmohan daalamia ke adhyaksh banane ke baad sara kuch chennai se kolkata ja rahaa he
 The rent of this hotel is in crores of a year
 yah jaankaree nikaali he, bihar ke aditya verma ne jo shrinivasana ke khilaaf supreme court gaye or aakhirkaar shrinivasana ko bisisiai kii kursi chhodni padi
 If Aditya Verma's words are correct, then Anirudh Chaudhary made Adam Chadwick a member of the BCCI Museum Committee, for which a huge amount of money was charged as consultancy fees
 adam chadvik emsisi ke curator bhi hai
 For your information, let me tell you that the BCCI treasury office is also in Pune and Chennai, although all the officials of BCCI are unpaid
 magar is dudharu board ke paas paise kii to kami nahin he or isi kaa phayda log uthaate hai
 The list of accusations by Aditya Verma is long, he says that earlier the board disbanded the National Cricket Academy of Bangalore and now board officials like Ratnakar Shetty and Anirudh Chaudhary are roaming around the world boards that the right of National Cricket Academy What should be a blue print? gaye adhikari englad, australia or dakshin africa kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Actually, Anirudh Chaudhary is considered to be from the Srinivasan camp
 unke pita ranvir manhidra bhi bisisiai ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 He has also been a Congress MLA in Haryana and Anirudh's grandfather Bansi Lal has also been the Chief Minister of Haryana, although Anirudh Chaudhary calls all the allegations against him baseless
 unka kahana he ki unke daftar kii saajasja par itnaa kharch nahin kiya gaya he
 The comments choudhary kaa kahana he ki kharch par muhar board kii finance samiti lagaati he, jise board kii kaarysmiti bhi anumodith karti he
 At the same time, Anirudh Chaudhary also says that Adam Chadwick was made during the tenure of Shashank Manohar, a member of the museum committee, but a former BCCI official jokingly said that it is the condition of the cricket board that consider Anirudh to be a treasurer
 The office was not opened in Bhiwani, as they are living there
 aisa bisisiai ke itihaas main ho chukaa he, jab jyoti vaajapeyi koshadhyaksh bane the tab vah kanpur se hi kaam kaaj kiya karte the or ek tarah se daftar bhi vahiin tha
 But then the BCCI did not have an official office of its own
 ab baqayda board kaa ek offis he, jo mubani ke vankhede stadium main he, magar jahaan kaa adhyaksh hota he vahiin bisisiai kaa amala shift ho jaataa he
 After Jagmohan Dalmiya became president, Sara is moving from Chennai to Kolkata

 45 of the three seats in Jharkhand, which will go to polls on Monday
 26 lakh se zyada voter 59 ummidavaaron kii kismat tay karenge
 Union Minister Sudarshan Bhagat is trying his luck from Lohardaga (ST) seat
 desh kii mobile companiyaan 2ji or 3ji spectrum kii nilaamee main 86 hajaar karod rupee tak kii boli laga chuki hai
 They hope that they will recover this cost from the increasing internet usage in India
 lekin fasebuk ke ek plan ko lekar bharat main oparate kar rahi mobile companiyaan chintaa main pad gai hai
 This is internet
 org project
 Who is going to give free internet to people
 1
 Project Features: Facebook's internet
 org project main duniya kii us do-tihaai aabaadi kii baat kii gai he, jo internet se maharoom he
 In order to reach the internet to these people, Facebook has made free surfing of some websites by entering into an agreement with a mobile service provider
 yani in website ko acces karne ke dauraan data charge nahin dena hoga
 It includes several news websites, Wikipedia besides Facebook and its messenger service
 ye aise logon ke liye phydemand he, jo mahangi daron kii vajah se apane mobile par internet kaa upyog nahin karte
 2
 koun he partner:asia main bharat pehla desh he, jahaan internet
 The org feature has been launched
 fasebuk ne yahaan apana partner reliance ko banaaya he
 Internet only on Reliance SIM
 org kii suvidha mil rahi he
 This facility has been started in 6 out of 22 mobile regions of the country
 isamen kerala, tamilnadu, andhrapradesh, telugana, maharashtra or gujarat shaamil hai
 It is to be launched across the country in the next two months
 3
 What is the business model: It is certainly beneficial for the consumer, but it is a great deal for the partner company like Reliance and the websites involved in this mission
 muft internet suvidha lene ke liye na sirf nae graahak balki duusari companiyon se jude log bhi reliance sim kaa istemaal karenge
 The advantage of websites is that when the burden of data charge will not be on the minds of the people, then they will be surfing more and more without worry
 website par jitani zyada hits hongi, utane zyada vigyaapan milenge
 4
 airtel ko pareshaani kya he:airtel ke pramukh sunil bharti mittal ne free internet ke maamle main fasebuk ke sansthaapak mark jakarberg par kataaksh kiya he ki yadi unhen bhalaai hi kerani he to ve samajaseva karen
 Actually, internet
 org kaa bharat main partner reliance he, jisaki airtel se pratispardhaa he
 Out of 22 circles in the country, Airtel's 3G service is in 13 circles, while Reliance has 15 circles
 free internet se reliance ko bhale hi maamuli phayda ho, lekin airtel kaa nuksaan zyada hoga
 However, Airtel offers internet in Africa
 org kaa partner he
 5
 free-internet dene kii koshishon main microsoft or google bhi:bharat main free internet dene ke liye microsoft bhi prayasarat he
 It is talking to the government to provide 200–300 mhz white space of spectrum
 yah abhi doordarshan ke paas he or vahaan iskaa istemaal nahin ho rahaa
 Internet can be operated like wifi up to a radius of 10 km on this bandwidth
 isi tarah google bhi apane loon project se duniya ke un doordaraj hisson tak internet pahunchane kii koshish main laga hua he, jahaan abhi iskaa koi infrastracchar nahin he
 Balloons in the project are designed as mobile hotspots
 bharat main internet

 The bjp's 'ad war' against Aam Aadmi Party convenor and CM candidate Airevind Kejriwal continued on Monday
 lagaataar tisare din akhabaaron main bijepi ne vigyaapan ke jariye kejariwal par nishaanaa saadhaa

 While making the Republic Day celebrations and parade passes an issue, the BJP slammed Kejriwal in the advertisement, while Arvind Kejriwal reacted strongly saying that it is hurting the entire Agarwal society

 Meanwhile, in the matter of day-climbing, bjp's hands and feet also swelled

 In the advertisement, Kejriwal has been quoted as saying, 'if i don't listen to you, the program on January 26 will also go to waste
 
 
 or ek saal baad viipi paas kii guhaar bhi lagaaunga!'vigyaapan main neeche bijepi ne kejariwal ko 'he andolankaaree' kehete hue sambodhit kar likhaa he, 'desh ke karodon log ganatantr diwas ko rashtriya parv manaate hai, is par garv karte hai
 And your unruly gotra was ready to interrupt it too
 ab dekhie is saal kisi palati khai
 
 
 VIP pass expected on Republic Day program
 'vigyaapan ke ant main bijepi ne likhaa he, 'are bhai tay kar lo ek baar

 Trouble in the ruling BJP and opposition Congress has intensified over the winter session of Parliament
 congress ne sarkaar par gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar sheetakaaleen satr main deree karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the government knows that if the session is called then it will be surrounded on issues like unemployment, Jai Shah and GST
 congress ne mangalawar ko sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue ek press conference kii
 The Congress alleged that the government implemented demonetisation and GST without consulting the opposition parties
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki november main hone vaale satr ko bevajaah taala ja rahaa he, sarkaar ke mantriyon ko bhi vajahon kaa pataa nahin he kyonkinirdesh sidhe pradhanmantricaryaalay se aate hai
 Encircling the government on the economy, the Congress alleged that the figures disclosed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were wrong, as it was the same in 2012
 congress ne kaha ki sarkaar ko kai muddon parasadan main jawaab denaapadegaa
 Where is employment, the government is surrounded by the defense deal, along with demonetisation and GST, the public is still suffering
 congress netaa aaazaad ne kaha ki hamen sarkaar chahie thi, lekin modi sarkaar chunaav ladane-ladaane kii mashin kii tarah kaam kar rahi he
 If the session is called, the government will open its doors
 isi vajah se satr main deree kii ja rahi he
 On the allegations of opposition, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Meghwal has said that the government will soon call a CCP meeting and announce the dates for the winter session
 unhone kaha ki satr main koi deree nahin ho rahi he, taarikh aage-peeche hoti rahati hai
 In retaliation, Meghwal said that this has been happening even during the Congress era and his allegations are the foundation
 jharkhand main eczit pole ke nattejey aane ke baad sabaki jubaan par ek hi sawaal he, 'koun banegaa mukhyamantri?' If you are in Ranchi and keeping an eye on the elections in Jharkhand, no one has a clear answer to this date
 sab naamon kii charchaa to karte hai, lekin asal jawaab, jisamen ek prashn bhi chipa hota he vah yah ki is sawaal kaa jawaab keval do vyaktiyon ke paas he
 They are - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 jo party ke dilli ke netaa hai, unka kahana he ki ek baar rigelt aa jane dijie, naam bhi maaloom chal jayega
 But whose name will it be and whether it will be tribal or non-tribal, it all depends on the actual number of election results
 alabatta kuch chijen spasht hai ki agar party ko prachand bahumat nahin mila, to vah saaf-suthri chhavi ke netaa ko kursi dene par punarvichaar kar sakati he
 If the BJP did not get the majority figure and once again came to form a mixed government, then the reins of power could be entrusted once again to Arjun Munda, who was chief minister three times
 arjuna munda ko milijuli sarkaar chalaane main maharath hasil he
 But the party is sure that Munde will not have the time to hand over the reins of power once again and will get the majority figure on his own
 aise main nishchit rup se pradhanmantri modi or amit shah jharkhand ko nae saal ke gift ke rup main kisi saaf-suthri chhavi ke netaa ko rajya kii gaddi saunpenge, kyonki jharkhand kii janata kii unase yah apeksha he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's office has refused to give information related to the Chief Minister's educational qualifications and his official residence in the capital Lucknow under the Right to Information Act
 yah khulaasa artiai kaaryakarta sanjay sharma kii ore se daayar kii gai artiai par mukhyamantri karyaalay ke anubhag adhikari or jan soochna adhikari basant kumaar tiwari dwaara die gaye ek jawaab se hua he
 According to the news agency IANS, Sanjay Sharma filed an RTI in the Chief Minister's office on May 5 last year and proof of the educational qualifications of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath from class 8 onwards, renovation work done at the Chief Minister's residence after Yogi's swearing in Information was sought on 8 points in relation to expenditure including recommendations, electricity bills and outstanding taxes of Municipal Corporation Lucknow etc

 RTI expert Sanjay says that the Public Information Officer has refused to give information on the wrong grounds
 bakaul sanjay unke dwaara maangi gai suchanaaen mukhyamantri or unke awaas ke aadhikarik kriyakalapon se sambandhit hai
 Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the Chief Minister's office of a state is not aware of the educational qualifications of its recent Chief Minister, renovation work done in the Chief Minister's residence, electricity bill and the outstanding tax of Municipal Corporation Lucknow

 rahul gandhi kaa agle ek maheene ke bheetar congress kaa adhyaksh bananaa tay ho gaya he
 Although Rahul's coronation was postponed for a long time due to different reasons, today the working committee meeting of the Congress announced the dates for the election of the new president of the party
 haalanki jo taarikh saamne ai hai use lekar raajnneeti ke jaankaar bhi chakra gaye hai or sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir congress ke man main kya he?ye hai congress adhyaksh chunaav kii tarikhenek disambar ko congress ke nae adhyaksh pad ke chunaav ke liye adhisuchana jari kii jaaegi
 After that, by December 4, interested candidates can submit their nomination papers
 5 disambar ko namakan patron kii jaanch kii jaaegi
 December 11 is the last date for withdrawal of nominations
 jarurat padane par 16 disambar ko voting hogi
 The votes will be counted on 19 December
 yani congress ke nae adhyaksh kaa naam 19 disambar ko saamne aayega
 Rahul will be elected as the Speaker on December 4! According to the election dates, nominations are to be made on December 4
 ummid he ki rahul gandhi ke saamne shaayad hi koi congressi netaa chunaav ladane ke liye aage aae
 Rahul Gandhi's dominance over the party's policy decisions and organization has been evident for a long time
 sonia gandhi swasthya kaarnon ke chalate pichley kaaphi lambey samay se sakriy nahin rahi hai
 In such a situation, it is not possible that there should be opposition in the party running on the gestures of Rahul Gandhi
 agar yah kayaas sach hote hai to 4 disambar kii shaam rahul gandhi congress ke agle adhyaksh ghoshit kiye ja sakate hai
 Announcement can also be slashed till 11 or 19 December! If anyone other than Rahul Gandhi files nomination papers, this announcement can slip by 11 December
 kyonki 11 disambar naam vaapasi kii antim taarikh he
 It is expected that by this day the nomination papers can be returned by removing the resentment of the Congress who have filed their nominations
 yani 11 disambar ko hi rahul ke nayaa congress adhyaksh banane par muhar lag sakati he lekin agar rahul ko chunauti mili or voting kii naubat ai to 19 disambar ko matganaa ke baad rahul kii tajposhi kaa elaan hoga
 Is the connection of gujarat-himachal elections when the news of the connection of Rahul's coronation in november-december first came to the question that the Congress wants to take advantage of this coronation in the gujarat-himachal Pradesh elections
 aisa isliye kyonki nae netritv se party ke kaaryakartaaon main nae josh kaa sanchaar hota lekin chunaav tareekhen jis tarah se nirdhaarit kii gai hai usamen party adhyaksh chunaavon kii matganana 19 disambar ko hogi jabaki 18 disambar ko gujarat-himachal chunaav ke nattejey aa chuke honge
 With this, Congress does not seem to have any intention of taking advantage of Rahul's coronation in these elections
 haar kaa thikra rahul ke sir nahin baandhna chaahati congress18 disambar ko chunavi nattejey aane ke agle din nae adhyaksh ke naam kaa elaan hone se ek sawaal ye bhi uth rahaa he ki phayda uthaane ke vipareet congress nahin chaahati ki chunaavon main kisi tarah kii vifaltaa ko rahul gandhi kii tajposhi se joda jaae
 Therefore, the 19th date has been deliberately kept for counting so that the results come only after that Rahul Raj starts in the Congress
 haalanki agar party kii yahi ranneeti he tab bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir kaise is maamle ko 19 disambar tak khinchaa jayega
 Because if there is no candidate against Rahul who has a lot of chances, then Rahul will become the president on 4 December itself
 tab 9 disambar or 14 disambar ko hone vaali gujarat chunaav kii voting unke chune jane ke baad hi hogi or nattejey bhi tabhi aaenge
 Apart from this, even if a Congress has filed nomination against Rahul on December 4, then the full seven days time has been given for withdrawal of name
 yani 11 disambar tak rahul ke khilaaf bharaa hua namakan patr waapas liya ja saktaa he
 If this happens, Rahul will be elected president unopposed on 11 December
 yani gujarat main duusare daur kii voting se teen din or matganana se puure 7 din pehle
 In such a situation, how will the party be able to separate Rahul from the election results? uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke ali or bajrangbali vaale bayaan kii chaahe jitani bhi aalochana hui ho lekin ek baat par sabhi raajnneetik pandit ekamat hai ki yogi adityanath kii upasthiti ne uttar pradesh main ram mandir mudde ko chunaav ke dauraan thanda rakhane main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 The issue of Ram Mandir, which has been the subject of controversy for a long time, suddenly got buried shortly before the election
 kya yah sirf modi lahar kaa nateeja tha yaa phir bijepi kii ek badi ranneeti kaa hissaa? yah sawaal uttar pradesh main kattar hinduvaadiyon se lekar raajnneetik panditon ke bich main gum rahaa he
 Why Ram temple issue remained untouched by this election? Yogi Adityanath has proved to be the biggest weapon to keep the saints and Hindus under control
 yah ek aashcharya kii baat he ki aisa chunaav jisamen mandir kaa mudda aisa ho gaya ki sadhu-sant bhi mandir chhodkar pehle modi kii baat karne lage
 Not much time has passed in Ayodhya when from October to December last year, from Vishwa Hindu Parishad to Hinduist organizations and Shiv Sena, the sky was raised over the date of the temple before the elections
 lekin aisa kya hua ki ek-ek karke sabhi shant hote chale gaye or puure chunaav main aisa laga jaise ram mandir to is desh main mudda kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Did Yogi become the armor of the temple issue? Actually, the BJP made both long-term and short-term strategies on the temple issue
 yogi adityanath ko jab mukhyamantri banaaya gaya to bijepi kii yah pasand kaiyon ke gale nahin utari lekin 2019 ke chunaav main prachand bahumat main ram mandir mudde kaa rattibar bhi yogadan nahin dikhaa to pataa chalaa ki yogi kii upyogita modi or shah kii jodi ne dhai saal pehle hi bhaanp lee thi
 Sensing that the temple issue will take time, Yogi Adityanath first launched the Deepotsav in Ayodhya
 vahaan diwaali manaai, ayodhya ke soundaryikaran or bhagwaan ram kii duniya kii sabase oonchi murti kaa project ayodhya ke logon or sadhu santon ke saamne rakhaa
 Due to which the anger of common people and saints and saints in Ayodhya was put under control
 kumbh ne mandir mudde par logon ke vishwaas ko majboot kiya?yogi adityanath ne prayag ke ardhakumbh ko pehle to kumbh kaa naam diya or phir kumbh ko bahut hi shandaar tareeke se aayojan kar tarif bhi khub batori
 Crores of pilgrims from all over the country praised the Kumbh of Prayagraj, which had an impact on the Hindu public, and people relied on the assurance of PM Modi and Yogi on the matter of the temple issue
 yogi adityanath naaraaz sadhu santon se lagaataar mandir mudde par charchaa karte rahe or mandir banane kii baat par unhen aashwast karte rahe
 Yogi Adityanath also appealed for patience to sages and saints
 ram mandir mudde ko dabaakar kaise upi jiti bijepi?yogi adityanath ati rashtravaadi or hinduvaadi vaicharik prishtabhumi se aate hai or duusare mandir andolan ke agua rahe gorakshnath peeth ke peethadhishwar hai
 Even today, every word originated from Gorakshnath Peeth is considered like a command in a large part of the monk-saint sect
 doosraa ram mandir se jude jitne bhi sadhu sant or sanghathan hai, yogi adityanath inke rag-rag se waakif hai, inaki kamiyon or inke prabhaav ko yogi se behatar koi nahin samajhataa
 In such a situation, when Yogi Adityanath was instructed to follow the temple issue as per the Supreme Court, then in UP, Yogi succeeded in convincing the sage saints on this issue that Modi's return will clear the path of Ram temple
 upi bijepi ke pravaktaa or yogi adityanath ke kareebi dow chandra mohan kehete hai ki ek taraf modi kii lokapriyata or unke kaam ne logon main vishwaas paidaa kiya
 So at the same time, due to the yogi among the sage saints and Hindu organizations, the belief that the temple will be built will be because the time is favorable and it is necessary to bring Modi back to the temple
 yah chunaav modi ko waapas laane ke liye jitna yaad kiya jayega utana hi bagaiyr ram mandir mudde ke liye bhi yaad kiya jayega
 The Delhi High Court has given a big relief to private schools, giving an important verdict on the nursery admission case in the capital
 court ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki aage se sabhi admician ganguli cameti ke disha nirdeshon ke mutabik kiye jaaen

 abhibhavakon ke ek samooh ne iske khilaaf yachika daayar kii thi
 Keeping his judgment safe, Justice Manmohan also prevented the Delhi government from issuing new notification for nursery admission for the upcoming academic session in the national capital
 adaalat ne donon pakshon kii daleelon ko sunne ke baad apane aadesh ko surakshit rakhane ke dauraan kaha tha ki yachikaayen nirarthak ho jaaengi agar sarkaar nae disha nirdesh jari karti he
 Now the rigging of the schools will start: After this instruction of the admission expert, the experts now believe that now the school administration will be completely independent
 har skool apane hisaab se niyam or kanoon banaaenge
 Experts believe that the way the management quota was cut last year
 ab is adhyadesh ke baad skool prashasan pichley saal kaa bhi harjaana vasuul kar lenge
 If the school administration does not act in the interest of parents after this decision, then this decision will also be challenged in the court in the coming days

 CM Fadnavis said - In this shameful case, the Chief Minister of the state Devendra Fadnavis said that it is extremely shameful that women in the 21st century have to fight for the worship of God

 kabhi sochaa he ki kya ho jab aapako pataa chale ki jinda rahane ke liye aapke paas sirf kuch saal hai? yaa kuch din yaa phir sirf chand ghante? maine bhi nahin sochaa
 We are so busy in the race of life that we forget to live life
 ham ye bhi bhul jate hai ki ek din hamen ye duniya chhod deni he
 All the people of this world have to leave
 apana parivaar, dost, pats, sapane or yaaden sabakuch
 And have you ever thought what will happen after you leave? Life is unpredictable, we call it unpredictable in serious language
 wo hamaari soch ke mutabik nahin chalati hamen uske mutabik chalanaa padataa he

 kahanijindagi kii jang or usamen sabakuch gavaan kar bhi jeene kii kahani he priyanka chopra kii film 'da ski ij pink
 'the story of the film is about a girl and her family
 ladki he aaysha choudhary (jaayra wasim), jo paidaa hone ke baad se hi SCID yani Severe Combined Immunodeficiency jaisi gambhir beemaari se jujh rahi he
 This means that Ayesha's body does not have an immune system, she can catch allergies very quickly and cannot go into the crowd
 agar usne koi bhi bacteria pakadaa to bahut jaldi bahut biimaar ho jaaegi
 Later, he also gets pulmonary fibrosis, which is incurable
 aaysha ke maa-baap niren choudhary (farhaan akhtar) or aditi choudhary (priyanka chopra) uske paidaa hone ke baad se hi use dilli ke har doctor ko dikhaa chuke hai or aage jaakar unhen landan main beti kaa ilaaj karwaanaa padataa he
 Aditi and Niren have no money and their child's life is in danger
 aditi kaa bada bhai ishan (rohit saraaf) bachapan se soch rahaa he ki use apni bahan ko bachaana he
 If you think that money can give you everything, then you are thinking completely wrong
 kyonki paisa aapako lagbhag sabakuch to de saktaa he lekin aapke kareebi kii jaan nahin lautaa saktaa
 And sometimes it cannot be saved
 niren or aditi ne din-raat kaam karke paise kamaaye or apni beti ke ilaaj main laga die
 Everyone knows what was the result
 asal jindagi kii kahani par aadhaarit is film main chupaane vaali koi baat nahin he
 All of us must have read or heard Ayesha's story at least once
 varanaa priyanka chopra or farhaan akhtar kaaphi samay se film kaa pramotion kar rahe hai, unhone is kahani ko sabhi ko bataaya he
 But still this story seems new to you
 aaysha kii jindagi, uske maa-baap kaa stregal or uske bhai kaa dar sab asli he or parde par jab aap use dekh rahe hote hai, to foot-footkar rone kaa man karata he
 Talking about performance, Toprianka Chopraka is a good Bollywood comeback
 ye film kaaphi imotional or khubasurat he or PC ne isamen badhiya kaam kiya he
 a girl who is brave and extremely stubborn, later becomes a never-give-up mother
 wo maa, jo apni beti kii jindagi bachaane or use ek or din jinda dekhne ke liye apane puri jaan laga detii he
 Priyanka Chopra's performance in the role of Aditi Chaudhary is powerful
 farhaan akhtar, aaysha ke pita niren choudhary ke kirdaar main hai
 Farhan's acting is different, you must believe this
 jab wo parde par hote hai, to or koi nahin hota
 a father who is always troubled, going to another country asking for money for the treatment of his child, a father who does not tell the pain he is feeling, who worked hard day and night to earn money
 In order to save her girl's life
 ye sab jab farhaan aapako is film main karke dikhaate hai, to aapkaa man unhen gale lagane ko karata he
 We all have fathers like this, who do everything for us and keep their sorrows hidden
 wo aapako strong rahane ko kehete hai bhale hi wo andar se kitne bhi kamjor hon
 In the film, Farhan and Priyanka leave each other behind in terms of performance
 aapako kuch seens main farhaan jabardast lagate hai to kuch main priyanka
 i think Ayesha was lucky enough to have a brother like Ishaan
 jahaan main or meraa bhai ek duusare se dhang se baat nahin karte, vahiin aaysha or ishan kaa rishta kaaphi gaharaa tha
 Rohit Saraf has done a great job in Ishaan Chaudhary's role
 ek badhiya seen film main he, jo unhone bataaya tha ki unke liye bahut mushkil tha
 But they have perfected that scene
 ab baat karte hai hamaari aaysha ke bare main
 Dangal actress Zaira Wasim is playing the character of Ayesha in this film
 jaayra ko hamane dangal or sikret superstar jaisi filmon main badhiya kaam karte pehle hi dekh liya he
 It was a completely different role, which he performed quite well
 jaayra film ko narat kar rahi hai
 His witty style, his work in the role of a sick girl
 sab kaaphi acha he
 Direction director Shonali Bose has worked hard to make this film available to all of us and he looks like it
 da ski ij pink, imotions se bhari he
 Never give up, always stand up, try something new in the daughter's life, try to give her a love life, take her to life's memorable adventure, Aditi (priyanka) and Niren (farhan) on screen You are just watching everything silently
 aapako samaj nahin aata ki inke dukh main hanse yaa khushi main roe? yaa phir kuch bhi naa karen
 There are many silent moments in the film, which are the most powerful
 film kaa mujeec bahut acha he, jo film khatm hone ke baad bhi aapke saath rahata he
 But this does not mean that the film does not have flaws
 kabhi-kabhi film main kuch silli moments bhi aate hai, actors kii acting thodi over yaa banaavati bhi lagati he
 It is also a little slow in many places
 lekin phir bhi ye film khubasurat he or aapako jindagi kii ahmiyat bataati he
 China is engaged in building a manned submersible that will be able to reach the foothills of all the oceans of the Earth

 In India, especially in Bollywood, the romantic genre films hold a special place
 filmon main hameshaa drametic andaaj main romance ko filmaaya jaataa rahaa he
 DDLJ, Silsila, Hum Aapke Hain Koun, Mohabbatein are examples of this
 hamaare samaaj kii maansikta kuch aisi he ki ek kapal ke liye puri aazaadee ke saath pyaar karnaa yaa relationships main rahanaa, samaaj ko hajam nahin hota
 If someone lives in a live-in, then it is considered a big crime in the eyes of the society
 natijatan kisi bhi kapal ke liye chhupakar pyaar karne ke alaava koi doosraa vikalp nahin batch paata
 Always have a fear in mind, fear of family, fear of patrons of religion, how can a love between them all breathe in the open air
 isliye film luka chuphi ke donon kirdaar guddu ( karthik aryan) or rashmi (kriti senon) bhi chhipakar pyaar karte hai
 The film's title has also been kept as 'luka Chuppi'
 movie kii ek khaas baat ye he ki isamen ek pyaar karne vaale jode ke jariye ye dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki nae yug main bhi liv in relationships ko lekar samaaj kaa kaisaa ravaiya he
 How do we impose a marriage on the youth? kaise aae din pyaar kaa katl hota he, man kii kasak, ek tis ban dilon main chubhti rahati he
 People get married without adopting marriage, they accept living with someone unknown
 relationships ek samjhauta nahin he, saath hi pyaar or shaadi do alag alag chijen hai
 The film tries to explain why it is right to live in a live-in before marriage
 kahani-film kii kahani guddu maathur kii he jo mathura main ek televijan reporter he
 Guddan falls in love with a girl named Rashmi
 rashmi ek dabang netaa trivedi ji (vinay pathak) kii beti he
 Trivedi is a staunch Hinduist and is full of old beliefs
 unki najar main wo log sabase zyada bure hai jo liv in main rahete hai
 Now Trivedi ji's daughter Rashmi, who loves Guddu but does not want to get married
 wo us shaks ko achche se jaan lenaa chaahati he jiske saath use apni puri jindagi bitaani he
 Even after being aware of her father's wrath, she does not want to compromise her life and wants to live in live
 magar guddu ko shaadi kii zyada jaldi he
 Due to fear of his family and Rashmi's father, he is afraid to stay in the live
 guddu ek middle class family se he
 There is a large family and it is generally the same as every middle class family
 samaaj main izzat se rahane or maan maryaada ke saath jivan vyateet karne vaala parivaar
 In such a situation, Guddu is assisted by his well-to-do friend, Abbas (aparshakti Khurana), but Raita spreads with the help of Abbas, as well as the challenges he faces to live and marry
 To know this, spend a little money and enjoy this two-hour entertainment film
 majaa bharpoor aayega
 Pankaj Tripathi plays a very interesting character in the film
 kyon dekhen film-film kii kahani bahut zyada prabhavi nahin he, magar jitani bhi he use filmaaya behad khubsuurati se gaya he
 The way the interesting characters are introduced in the film will not let your laughter stop from the beginning to the end
 karthik aryan or kriti kii acting bhi acchhee he
 Kriti is playing the role of a sensible girl in the film who makes a lot of decisions in her life
 vahiin karthik ko har cheez main jaraa jaldbaaji si rahati he
 It is interesting to see the way both of them struggle to get married in the film
 movie ke ek seen main kriti or karthik, liv in ko aparaadh qaraar die jane par kehete hai ki ye ek aparaadh nahin mudda he
 So the film has also been made on the same issue, just keeping the way of filming is not kept serious, due to which the audience can enjoy the film very much
 kyon naa dekhen film-film naa dekhne kii koi badi vajah nahin he
 Today, every person is under stress of work
 aise main luka-chuphi aapke liye best time paas sabit hogi
 If you are accustomed to seeing more scenes full of romance in the film or your favorite genre is a romantic film, then hide and seek may disappoint you a bit
 film main karthik or kriti ke bich kii chemistry or pyaar, kamedi kaa overdoj daalane ke chakkar main kahin dab gaya he
 The comic character of Pankaj Tripathi and Aaparshakti has been seen to dominate the romance of karthik-kriti
 donon ne alag-alag to acha abhinay kiya he magar ek kapal ke taur par unki camestry koi khaas prabhavi nahin he
 So Luka Chuppi should be considered less of a romantic-comedy film, more of a comedy-romantic film
 box offis-box offis par film joardaar kamai kar sakati he
 Pankaj Tripathi, who is rich in acting variety in the film, has done many scenes
 iske alaava ye film puri tarah se yuva kendrit he
 The film's earnings are likely to be bang
 14 november hameshaa bacchon ko khush kar jaataa he kyonki yah din unke naam he
 India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's birth anniversary was named after the children
 na jane kitni pidiyon ne apane skool main bal diwas manaaya
 But this year, this day looks like surrounded by some controversies
 har vishay par vivaad karnaa or raajnneeti karnaa ham bharatiyon ke swabhaav kaa hissaa ho gaya he
 In the events of Abachacha Nehru's birthday, the Congress sparked a new controversy by not calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that it is the prerogative of the Congress not to invite and call on the occasion
 ek najar main yah baat to saamaanya si lagati he lekin gaharaai main jaakar dekhne par lagata he ki congress netritv modi sarkaar dwaara sardaar patel ko ati mahatv die jane se naakhush he
 The Congress always tried to call Nehru the greatest leader of the country after Gandhi
 wo log jinase nehru ke vichaar vaimnasy the unhen congress ne dur hi rakhaa jinamein doctor rajendra prasad, sardaar patel, subhash chandra bose sareekhe netaa the
 The Congress did this as a political strategy because it wanted to make the personality of Nehru so big and wide that it would be easy for those with his legacy to remain in power
 matlab saaf tha ki is tarah se nehru ke vaarison ko desh main atirikt mahatv mili or unhen satta ke kendra main rakhaa ja sake
 This went on for a long time and remained a major part of Congress politics
 nehru ne kya kiya or kya nahin in par hajaaron panne likhe ja chuke hai
 But Narendra Modi's blatant entry into the country's politics turned everything around
 unhone sardaar patel ko tyaag or deshbhakti kii adwitiya pratimurti bataakar ek nayaa mudda uthaaya
 This was an attempt to keep him parallel to Nehru and the Congress felt it was an indirect challenge to him
 jaahir he apane pratik chinh ko peeche hote dekhnaa congress ke liye mushkil he
 It was a political shock for him
 shaayad isliye unhone nehru jayanti par pradhanmantri modi ko bhi bulaanaa uchit nahin samajha
 The Congress lost here because Pandit Nehru would always be counted among the top leaders of the country, not just the Congress, and invitations to some and not to others on his birth anniversary show his narrow mindset
 yah ek ghabaraai hui party kaa ulta kadam he jisase nehru jaise vishaal hriday vaale rajaneta kii galat tasviir pesh hoti he
 There was often a quarrel between a husband and wife
 jhagade ke dauraan patni hameshaa yahi dhamkee detii ki wo apni jaan de degi
 The two then quarrel one day
 par is baar patni sachmuch khud par mitti kaa tel daal leti he
 Matchbox is in his hand
 patni tab kichen main thi or pati kichen ke baahar
 Then the husband suddenly picks up the mobile and calls the family members of the wife
 idhar, wo phone par rote hue ghar ke halaat bataa rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, at the same time, his wife suddenly burns the matchstick
 ab aage sab kuch live tha
 Kuldeep- Look at this, she is sitting with a match in her hand and what is she doing now
 abhi daravaaza kholaa or ye bhaiyyu gir gaya
 Bhaiyu was also inside
 or ye mitti ke tel main puri nahaai hui he

 He lured the businessman that if he incurred the cost of lab test then he can also earn big profit
 munaafe kaa laalach dekar lab test ke liye ve kaarobaari se samay-samay par paise ugaahne lage

" unhone mujhe bataaya ki richard atonbaro kasturba ke role ke heroin kii talash main shahar aa rahe hai
 Doli asked me to meet him
 maine kasturba ke role ke liye audishan diya or main salect ho gayi
 Everyday, the essay with the message of celebrating Gandhi Jayanti was received by Rohini, the role of Sarahakasturba, but for this he had to work very hard
 kirdaar main dhalane ke liye unhenvajan ghatanapada
 Because on the screen, he had to show Kasturba's journey of 27 to 74 years

 Kingsley and Rohini had to practice spinning wheel
 vah donon rojaanaa do ghante charkha chalaane kii practice karte the
 Apart from this, Rohini had to extract a lot of spun
 apana sabase mushkil seen bataate hue rohinee ne kaha, shooting ke vakt budhaape ke seen shoot karnaa sabase mashkil tha
 Because aging is a gradual process

 The Supreme Court has lifted the ban on the decision to convict Bollywood's overbearing actor Salman Khan in a black buck hunt case
 ab salmaan britain jaise kai deshon main nahin ja sakate, kyonki in deshon main kisi bhi maamle main doshi vyakti ko vija nahin miltaa
 Not only this, Salman will also have to get permission from the court every time before going abroad
 court ne kaha ki agar salmaan chahen to hoicourt ja sakate he or hoicourt phir se is par vichaar kar saktaa he
 The Supreme Court during the hearing of the case had criticized the Rajasthan High Court, saying that the case may be good for suspension of sentence but not for stay of conviction
 kanoon sabhi par samaan rup se lagu hona chahie
 There should be no partiality with the culprits, however, on 27 August last year, Salman Khan filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating that the courts have always treated him as an ordinary citizen and never given him any special facility
 darasal, rajasthan hoicourt ne 12 november 2013 ko apane aadesh main kaale hiran ke shikaar prakaran main salmaan khan kii 2006 kii doshasiddhi par roak laga di thi, jiske khilaaf rajasthan sarkaar ne supreme court main apil kii thi
 The government argued that according to the UK visa rules, visas cannot be granted to those convicted for more than four years, so Salman took a suspension on the convict for going on the shooting
 rajasthan kii nichali adaalat ne salmaan khan ko 26-27 sitambar 1998 main bhavad main film shooting ke dauraan kaale hiran kaa shikaar karne ke aparaadh main doshi tehraate hue paanch saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 Salman had also been in jail in this case, but later he came out on bail
