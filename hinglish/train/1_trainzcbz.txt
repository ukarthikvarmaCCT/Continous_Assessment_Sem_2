 com / utjjwmtmoh bhartiya sena kaa jawan chandu babulal chouhan 21 janvari ko pakistan se reeha hokar swadesh lautaa or aath din baad apane bade bhai or dadaji se mila
 Met twice in two days
 chandu or bhushan bhai hai
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Bhushan told about the torture he had with Chandu
 chandu se mulaaqaat ke bare main bhushan ne bataaya ki " chandu bolaa kam or royaa zyada, unhen is baat kii khushi he ki usne sabhi ko pahchaan liya"
 Bhushan said that Chandu kept on crying for more than half of an hour's meeting, "mentally did not take much problem, but when asked about Nani told that Nani is no longer in this world, she started crying even more"
 chandu nani kaa laadla tha
 Chandu was very young when his parents died
 thik tarah se chal bhi nahin paata tha
 Nani grew up by raising Chandu, so for her Chandu was like a mother
 ab wo nani bhi is duniya main nahin he
 Bhushan said that Chandu has not been able to walk properly since returning from Pakistan
 chandu ke ghutane main chot lagi he
 He is having difficulty walking
 doctor ke kahe anusaar das dinon main jakhm thik ho jaaenge
 There have also been many injuries in the fingers of his hand
 pakistani phogiyondvaara kiye gaye torchar ke bare main chandu ne bhushan ko bataaya ki use khud ke saath hone vaali chizon kaa kuch pataa nahin tha
 They used to give him frequent injections and also had trouble eating
 use hardam kalkothri main hi rakhte the
 Whenever he was taken, he used to take black cloth on his face
 amritsar main jab bhushan or chandu kii mulaakaat hui tab unke aas-paas bhartiya faujee the
 There were restrictions on asking more questions
 bhushan ne bataaya ki wo chandu se zyada baaten nahin kar paae
 He could not ask more questions because the military officers were not allowing more questions
 chandu ne bataaya ke saadhe teen maheene lagaataar injection lagane kii vajah se vah sudhabudh kho chukaa tha
 Half was in a state of unconsciousness
 chandu ne bhai ko bataaya ki use do yaa teen din main ek baar khaanaa diya jaataa tha
 He did not see the light in three and a half months
 jab roshni dekhi to koi uski dadhi kaat rahaa tha to koi uske bal kaat rahaa he
 Chandu was still in a state of half-unconsciousness at that time
 chandu ke sharir par chotein to dikhaai de rahi thi lekin bhushan kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne use jinda waapas kiya yah myne rakhata he
 Now that the enemy's army has taken hostage, it is but natural to be tortured
 apni baat samajhane ke liye bhushan ne bataaya ki kaise gadee kaa accident hone par kai baar chotein aati hai, khun nikalataa he lekin ham khud ko khushnaseeb samajhate hai ki jaan batch gayi
 It should be understood that Pakistan left Chandu alive and left soon
 bhushan chouhan ne phir ek baar bhartiya fouj ke aalaa adhikario kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Thanked the Government of India and expressed confidence that his brother would soon come back to the village to meet his family well

 purv pakistani cricketer shahid aafridi kashmir par die gaye apane bayaan se palat gaye hai
 Now he has said that his statement on Kashmir was not presented properly
 shahid aafridi ne kashmir ko lekar do twit kiye hai or apni safai pesh kii he
 In his first tweet, he has said that part of his statement has been shown to be incomplete and in the second tweet that his statement has been misinterpreted
 My clip is incomplete & out of context as what i said before that is missing
 Kashmir is unresolved dispute & under brutal Indian occupation
 It must be resolved as per UN resolution
 Myself along with every Pakistani support Kashmiri freedom struggle
 Kashmir belongs to Pakistan
 - Shahid Afridi (@safridiofficial) November 14, 2018 In the first tweet, he wrote, 'my clip is incomplete and is cut out of context
 isse pehle maine jo kaha vah gaayab he
 Kashmir is an unresolved quarrel and subject to the brutal rule of India
 ise sanyukt raashtra ke samjhaute ke anusaar suljhaayaa janaa chahie
 Along with every Pakistani, i also support the freedom struggle of Kashmir

 His statement got a lot of resistance in Pakistan and it was highly praised by the media in India
 iske baad unhone apane puraane bayaan se pair khinch liye
 Shahid Afridi had said that because Pakistan does not manage its four provinces, Pakistan should not worry about Kashmir
 shahid aafridi yahaan apni sanstha shahid aafridi foudansion se jude kisi kaarykram main hissaa lene aae the
 Statements on Kashmir have been given many times
 It is worth mentioning that even before this, Shahid Afridi has spoken many times on the issue related to Kashmir
 pichley saal bharat main hue tii-20 vishwacap ke dauraan ek match main shahid ne kaha tha ki hamen saport karne ke liye kai log kashmir se bhi aae the main unka dhanyavad karata hum
 This statement of Shahid also created a ruckus
 bayaan ke alaava shahid kashmir kii azaadi ke samarthan main kaaphi twit kar chuke hai
 He tweeted in 2017 that Kashmir is a paradise that has been a victim of violence for a long time, now is the time to resolve the issue
 is twit main unhone likhaa tha ki 'ai stand wyeth kashmir, kashmir soliderity de
 Shahid wrote, 'the situation in India-occupied Kashmir is becoming fragile
 vahaan par azaadi kii awaz ko dabaaya ja rahaa he or begunaahon ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 But it is surprising to see that the united nation is still there
 sanyukt raashtra is tarah kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye koi karrwai kyon nahin kar rahaa he'

 Inflation is going up because of high food prices
 news agency royatres ke ek surveykshan main desh ke pramukh iconomist ne yah anumaan lagaaya he
 However, there are still some relief points for the Modi government after inflation has steadily increased, due to which the Reserve Bank may once again cut interest rates

 3 fisadi rahegi jo ki pichley 10 maheene kaa sabase ooncha str he
 Its first retail inflation rate in the month of July
 15 fisadi thi
 Why is there still relief for the government, according to the officials, due to heavy floods in the south-western states, there was a supply disruption, which is expected to increase inflation in August

 isi prakaar mukhya mahangaai (khaadya or urja keemton ko chhodkar) main bhi agast maheene main teji aane kii ashanka he
 The reason for this is that due to deep global economic slowdown, gold prices have gone up sharply and reached a six-year high

 isi bich sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi congress kaarysmiti kii baithak se baahar aa gaye
 Sonia Gandhi said that it was not fair for her to be involved in the process of being elected president nor did Rahul

 When the Congress was going all out to elect the president, Rahul Gandhi's arrival and departure left many questions
 mana ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi ko yah bataane ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha ki sabhi samitiyon ne unheen ke hi naam par raay jaahir kii he
 But Rahul Gandhi has already resigned from this post, so he turned down the offer and walked out
 or sach bhi yahi hua jab congress kii aadhikarik press conference hui jisamen randeep singh surajevaala ne saaf kaha ki paanchon cametiyon main rahul gandhi kaa hi naam aayaa lekin rahul gandhi ne vinamrata purvak ise thukraa diya or phir congress ke antarim adhyaksh ke taur par sonia gandhi ko yah jimmedaari di gai jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 The meeting ended about 1 hour after Rahul left
 rahul aae to sahi baithak main hi the lekin or kashmir par bhi baat hui hogi lekin vah asli baat ko chipa gaye ki unhen isliye bulaayaa gaya tha taaki phir jimmedaari un ko saunpi ja sake

 Even though many measures are being taken regarding pollution, the burning of waste at the Ghazipur landfill site in Purvi Delhi is teasing everyone
 janata jahrili hawa main saans lene ko majaboor he
 Hazardous smoke from the fire at the Ghazipur landfill site is threatening the entire area, but this is not the first time
 yah jarur he ki isko lekar pehali baar emsidi apni purvi dilli nagar nigam ne apni laachaargi jataai he
 Actually, a mountain of garbage has formed at the Ghazipur landfill site, from which methane gas comes out
 isaki vajah se aag lag jaati he, lekin ise rokane kaa tarika philhal emsidi ke paas nahi he
 MCD Mayor Neema Bhagat says that at this stage the MCD is trying to keep the water tanker at the Ghazipur landfill site, but it takes a lot of time to do it
 ab emsidi ko bharosa neshnal haive othirity of india kaa he ki vah kude kaa istemaal sadak nirmaan ke liye karegi
 From November, 2500 metric tons of waste will be used in road construction, but it will take about two years to finish the National Highway Authority of India
 philhal emsidi ke paas aag se or usase nikalne vaali jahrili gas se nibatane kaa koi intjaam nahi he
 Many times, due to hot weather or even a small spark, a gas ignites
 iske saath hi kooday ke dher ke neeche bhi kai dinon tak aag jalati rahati he jo hawa ko or jaharila banaati he
 According to the corporation officials, because the height of the landfill site is about 50 meters and the pipe that is laid to extinguish it when it is on fire, it takes time, which makes it very difficult to control the fire that spreads rapidly
 ajadpur mandi ke kooday ko lekar gopal raay ne alji ko likhaa patradusri taraf, dilli ke vikaas mantri gopal raay neazadpur mandike kude ko lekar alji anil baijal ko patr likhaa he
 The letter is about the Bhalswa landfill site, where LG has banned the dumping
 vikaas mantri gopal raay kaa tark he ki bhalswa leadphil site ko pratibandhit kiye jane ke baad ajadpur mandi kaa kooda tikri khampur main daalaa ja rahaa tha, jahaan logo ne iskaa virodh kiya
 After this, the waste of Azadpur Mandi is rotting in Mandi itself
 isse bimaariyaan failane kaa khatra he
 He has requested the Lieutenant Governor to direct the Commissioner of Northern Municipal Corporation to dump garbage at the Bhalswa landfill site
 mandi se kooda nagar nigam uthaata he, jiske liye mandi samiti prati varsh 1 karod 70 lakh rupee nagar nigam ko detii he
 Joint Commissioner Mukesh Meena in Delhi ACB has been transferred to Andaman Nicobar
 mangalvaar ko jari hue ipies afasaron ke tabadale kii list main meena kaa bhi naam he
 Meena will have to leave Delhi by April 1
 meena ke tabadale se kejariwal sarkaar ke liye raahat kii ummid lag rahi he kyonki meena ke asibi yani anti karpshan branch se jane se mukhiya adishnal kamishnar es
 s
 yadav ho jaaenge jo kejariwal sarkaar kii taraf se niyukt hue hai or kejariwal ke vishwaas praapt afasaron main hai
 But the picture is not completely clear right now as Meena was transferred to Arunachal Pradesh earlier from April 1, 2015 but she was not relieved and posted in Delhi ACB on 8 June 2015 and was considered as ACB chief due to being senior 
 tippaniyan Due to this, the weapon named ACB went from Kejriwal's hand, which led him to take action against corruption
 haalanki kejariwal sarkaar ne iskaa virodh bhi kiya lekin court ne kaha ki meena kanoon ke hisaab se kaam karen
 One thing is also going to see if LG Najeeb Jung will replace another officer in Meena? Or if no officer of this level is appointed, then ACB will again come into Kejriwal's hands

 lekin abhi tasviir puri tarah saafe nahin he kyonki meena kaa tabadalaa pehle bhi ek april 2015 se arunachal pradesh ho gaya tha lekin unako relive nahin kiya gaya or 8 june 2015 ko dilli asibi main tainaat kar diya gaya or senior hone kii vajah asibi pramukh maane gaye
 The comments iske chalate asibi naam hathiyaar kejariwal ke haath se chalaa gaya jisase wo karpshan ke khilaaf karrwai kar raaje the
 Although the Kejriwal government also opposed this, the court said that Meena should work according to the law
 ek baat ye bhi dekhne vaali he ki kya alji najeeb jang kisi duusare afasar ko meena kii jagah lagaayenge? yaa phir agar is str ke kisi afasar kii niyukti naa hui to asibi phir se kejariwal ke haath main aa jaayegi

 hilaal mir kaa makaan
 Time, early nineties
 kirdaar, dow
 Mir and his wife Ghazala
 halaat, dow
 Mir has sheltered some militants at home for treatment
 or aise main dari hui gajala apane shuhar hilaal se puuchhati he
 Which side are you on? kuch thaharkar puri sanjidagi ke saath ankhen mila doctor sahab jawaab dete hai
 life
 is kathan ke saath shakespeare ke naatak se prerit or kashmir kii prishthbhumi par aadhaarit film 'haidar' apana tampo set karti he
 Life that is swinging between freedom and terrorism
 or siyasat ke pher main na maaloom kitni hi jindagiyaan apni saanson kii door ko majbootee se thame noummidi ke barfile daur main puri garmaahat ke saath cheekh rahi hai
 'hyder' is a story woven from silence born after screams
 ek film sameekshak ke taur par aap aisi hi filmon kaa intjaar karte hai
 Days, weeks, months and sometimes years
 kyonki 'haidar' jaisi filmein aapako apane kahan ke dhang, vishay kii jatilta ko baratane ke andaaj, kirdaaron ke reshon kii gathan, sangeet, adaakaari, samvaad or in sabake kul jamaa jaadui asar se samrudh karti hai
 a new lesson in cinema provides a new lesson
 agar aap achche cinema ke shaukeen hai, to is film ko kisi bhi keemat par dekhne jaaie
 Hyder's helpless 'haider' is the story of a boy named Hyder
 use uske pita dow
 Mir sends him away from Kashmir to Aligarh
 taaki betaa aman bhang ke daur main mahfuj rahe
 Meanwhile, the doctors caught in the crime of sheltering the militants disappear
 matampursi ke liye pahunchaa haidar dekhtaa he ki uski maa gajala to uske chachaa or peshey se vakil khurram ke saath kahkahe laga rahi he
 There is a slight crack inside Hyder
 or iske saath hi ek kashmakash kii shuruyaat hoti he
 After all, who is the villain? The Indian state, which captures Hyder's father
 pakistan, jo in charampanthiyon ko badhaava de rahaa he
 The political leaders of Kashmir became the pawns of both of them
 uski maa, jiske chehre par us vakt shikan nahin he, jis vakt haidar maujuud nahin he
 His uncle Khurram, who has been betraying his mother, and eventually the consent of the two, leads to their marriage or even Hyder's own helplessness and confusion
 baharhaal, haidar apni dost or mashooqa or peshey se patrkaar aarshia or uske police captain pita ke saaye tale baap kii talash shuru karata he
 During this time, he is also jealous of the growing relationship between mother and uncle
 khud apane hisse kii ooshmaa bhi aarshia se hasil karata he
 And then politics is represented in his life with two different faces
 ek ujbak chaal vaala aadmi ruhadaar use uske baap ke bare main, unke paigaam ke bare main bataata he
 Here is Khurram, who reads the truth of his part about these silsils or say that statement in front of Hyder
 in sabake bich haidar apane intkaam ke mansoobon ko amali jama pehanaane main jute jaataa he
 Not every character in 'haider' movie can be painted in one color
 or yahi is film kii ek bahut badi khubi ban jaati he
 Hyder seated on the throne of the enchanted flock watching Arshiya's careless dance
 laal chowk par raajnneeti kii khilli udaata haidar
 Loves the father, but is driven by the emotional blackmail of the mother
 khunriji andaaj main mishanri tareeke akhriyaar karata haidar
 This is just a sample
 har kirdaar kii yun hin kai paraten najar aati hai
 And obviously this is possible due to the story, screenplay and dialogues written in depth
 kashmir besd patrkaar bashaarat pir kii kitaab 'karfude nits' aap sabko padhani chahie
 The Kashmiris came to understand the truth
 or inhen bashaarat ne vishaal ke saath milakar pehle 'hamelet' ke mul dhaanche ko samajha
 And then raised him alive on Indian soil
 acting aisi ki jism dhadkna band kar deecting kii agar baat karen, to mujhe yaad aa rahaa he tamaam logon kaa shahid kapur ko chalaa hua hathiyaar bataanaa
 He also had his reasons for this
 magar is film ke jariye shahid ne bataa diya ki 'kamine' mahaj ek ittfa nahin thi
 This boy has acted in many places that even seeing him forgets to beat and breathe
 shraddha kapur ne bhi aarshia ke role ko jo jindagi bakshi he
 She provides a variety of comfort and faith
 so cold menstream cinema kii yah glamras new entry aisa bedaag kirdaar kis khubsuurati se nibhaati he
 Now talk of Tabu, KK Menon and Irrfan
 mujhe yaad aa rahaa he tulsidas ji kaa likhaa kuch
 When Mahakavi understood that at one place in the Ramacharit Manas, all the similes had been missed, he wrote, "ram to Ram
" siya si siya
 'that means, with the help of these two and anything, it is inadequate
 kuch aisa hi in teen actaron ke bare main kehane kaa ji karata he
 Had Hyder's name also been Ghazala, there would have been no inferiority
 isi se aap samaj lijie ki film kii ridh tabboo kaa kirdaar he
 And the duality of the story is also that of Hyder and Ghazala
 khurram ke chalbaaj, magar ekant main dua ke liye thartharaate hadh badaye insaan ko khub jiya
 He has admonished the man's authoritarian and every possible plotting attitude to get his purported rights
 irfan ruhadaar ke role main kuch der ko aate hai
 But when he comes, just like Nasim comes
 or us vakt aap sab kuch bhuulakar ek saanp kii tarah ho jate hai
 Sudar Bisar used to pour on the snake bean
 film ke baaki kirdaaron ke liye bhi jitna likhaa jaae utana kam he
 Have Narendra Jha in the role of Hyder's father
 yaa phir salmaan kaa role karte do actor
 In the Indian theatrical tradition, the responsibility of creating the conditions of Haas is responsible for the clown
 shakespeare ke yahaan bhi aisa hi he, magar ek atirikt jimmedaari ke saath
 His comic characters are also intimate partners of tragedy
 'haidar' main video librari chalaane vaale do bhai or salmaan ke maha vikat fain is ferj ko bakhubi anjaam dete hai
 Their presence takes the film to a different corner
 'haidar' ke kirdaar sirf jism, jubaan or jaan vaale hi nahin he
 The valley also makes its presence felt without speaking
 or yahi tark sangeet ke aivaj main bhi diya ja saktaa he
 You can listen to each song written by Gulzar repeatedly during frantic meditation to fumigate
 or ye shabd jis sur kii algani par latak jhuumate hai
 Vishal has made it
 kahin saral, to kahin pravaahman to kahin bharpoor naatakeeyata liye ye sangeet film kaa ek or ahm kirdaar he
 The film's dialogues convey the complexity of the subject without being loud
 apane paigaam main haidar se dow
 Mir says right-hearted
 meraa intkaam lenaa bete
 The rooster asks
 or bivi kaa kya
 So Mir speaks
 use allaah ke insaaf ke liye chhod dena
 And when the scales of justice are felt by Haider
 to vah bolta he
 Your mother
 aap jehar khubasurat hai
 Beauty does not last for one piece
 apni kabr khodo or so jaao
 Or, who is going to be massacred, like a corpse, like dialogues, can interpret thousand interpretations in his womb
 vishaal bharadwaj adbhud chitere hai
 Films like 'spider', 'blue Umbrella' and 'kaminey' are in his account
 or ek alag hi almaari he shakespeare kii, jahaan vishaal or bhi vishaal ho jate hai
 And i would like to say with a claim that 'haider' is the most spectacular film of this director Vishal ever
 baat kashmir kii
 
 
 This is the talk of the film
 ab baat kashmir kii siyasat or use is film main jo pairahan diya gaya, uski
 Suppose Kashmir is a woman
 ek khubasurat or apni hi dillagi main masaroof aurat
 One day, two men choose this woman to decorate the battle of strength
 donon ke apane apane daawey hai
 And the disquiet that is taking place in these contenders, she is a woman
 film 'haidar' kii khaasiyat ye he ki yah dukh kii kahani kahati he
 Grief that is a woman herself
 or ye kahani kehete hue ye kisi ke bhi prati sahanubhuti paidaa karne kii hadabdaahat nahin dikhaati
 Grief in itself can be very uninteresting
 tamaam vajahon or logon ke baavjood, ye 'haidar' ke aatmraag ko sun samajha ja saktaa he
 'haider' is also the story of a woman
 gajala kii kahani
 Whose existence and importance rests on the institution of family name and the pillar of male name
 ye aurat pati ke saath he or bete ke moh main he
 But when this woman turns to someone else
 to bete ke bheetar kaa purush jaag jaataa he
 This is a strange duality of sexuality
 or agar haidar kii taraf khadey hokar dekhen
 So it is like trying to burn fire with fire
 haidar, ek jagah ruundhe gale se kahata bhi he
 There were other ways to break away from Abbu
 bete ko maa kaa ye premika vaala tarika ek kism ke vishwasghaat sa laga
 And mother, she is silent in front of the son
 bhale hi uske bheetar kii aurat mukhar hona chaahati ho
 Because she knows that she cannot explain this truth to him to understand his situational thinking
 to aise main 'haidar' ek aurat ke pyaar par apane apane hisaab se kabje kii ladaai bhi ban jaati he
 Which has Khurram on one side, Hyder on the other side
 or ain is jagah gajala gajala na rahakar kashmir ban jaati he
 If we talk about Kashmir, then cinema has been stubborn about it for a few decades
 agar vahaan ke logon kii aawaaj buland karo to turant aapaki deshbhakti par sawaal uthaa die jaaenge
 If you set the heels according to the attitude of the army, you will be told to be ruthless and bound in the boundaries of the border
 aise main diarector or riter ke liye badi mushkil thi
 But he was handled very diligently
 ugravadiyon ke taur tareeke, kashmiri panditon kaa palaayan, gaayab hote log, bevaa auraten, yateem bachche, fouj, clashinkove, seemaa paar janaa, siyasat chamakaana
 Or to be young in such times
 kitna dikkat bharaa he ye sab
 And after narrating the story of all these problems, Hyder is finally pushed into such a trench
 jahaan use chunaav karnaa hi he
 The father says
 meraa intkaam lenaa haidar
 Mother says
 intkaam se sirf intkaam hi paidaa hota he, aazaadee nahin
 Hyder chooses and that is why this film also becomes courageous
 'haidar' sirf intkaam kii kahani hi nahin
 It is also a collection of many love stories
 apane abbu se faij ahamed faij ke sher sunata betaa
 Who considers them like God and does not want to be away from them even for a single moment
 apane bete se beintahaan muhabbat karti maa
 When Arshiya and Hyder's love, which clings between the hollows of a pillar of Chinar, itself, in the words of Gulzar itself, 'I am the sky, you are my land'
 ek prem kahani salmaan khan or unke diwane do salmaan kii bhi he
 There is also a love story of Arshiya and her policeman Papa
 dekhie to jaraa
 Here how a woman weaves, dismounts and then ends up wrapped in it
 aarshia apane pyaare papa ke liye ek laal oon kaa mafalar banaati he
 Then the same muffler ties his father in Hyder's hands for his understanding and partnership, so that he does not run away
 or jab aadhi duniya khatm hoti he, to baaki aadhe ko yaad karte hue aarshia use udhed detii he
 Wool does not remain wool, becomes a trap in which he is imprisoned
 vallaah, ye aadmi vishaal bharadwaj celulide par kitni maarmik, pavitra or sureeli katha kavitaayen rachataa he
 Go and listen to it, behold and then listen to it for years

 Every relationship comes with ups and downs and the girlfriend-boyfriend relationship is not untouched
 kai baar aisa hota he ki rishta itane bure mode par aa jaataa he ki usase alag ho janaa hi behatar lagane lagata he
 Being separated from someone is not as painful as going to the front to tell the truth
 aap donon ke bich sambandh chaahe jitne kharaab kyon na ho chuke honkoshish kerani chahie ki jab aap apane saathi ko ye bataa raheto aapaki bhashaa or vyavhaar shaleen rahe
 Many times it happens that separation does not hurt as much as the breakup method
 agar aapane ye tay kar liya he ki ab alag hi hona he tokhud main himmat paidaa kiijie or shaleen tareeke se isrishte ko khatm kiijie
 But often the end of a relationship becomes so bad that it keeps piercing throughout its life
 aise main in tareekon se bachanaa hi behatar he:1
 Trying to hide is not going to help you
 wo aapse mulaakaat karnaa chahta he par aap usase chhip rahi hai
 The boy constantly calls and messaging you, but you run away from him
 ye tarika galat he
 It will be in the interest of both of you to tell the truth in front
 2
 Telling him now you will be friends, although you do not become rude by saying this, but this is also not the right way
 isse pehle aap ek gahare sambandh main the or ab aap apana peechha chhudaane ke liye use dosti kaa rang dene kii koshish karne lagi hai
 It would be difficult for him to consider you as a friend to his girlfriend in just one stroke
 3
 It is really wrong to ask another friend to bring a third person in the middle of your relationship
 agar aapmen himmat he to aapako khud jaakar ladke ko kahana chahie ki aap ye rishta khatm kar rahi hai
 It is absolutely wrong to make a friend a medium and to convey your point to him
 4
 It is wrong to cheat you to cheat him
 use bina suchit kiye or bina koi vajah bataae aap usase alag hokar kisi or se pyaar karne lag jaati hai
 The person in front of you will be sad because of this he may also get angry
 chizon ko uljhane or dhokhaa dene se behatar he ki aap sach bol den
 5
 massej kar denahalanki ye sabase aasaan tarika he lekin sahi nahin
 You start to feel free by sending a message, but many questions arise in the mind of the person reading the message, which can be solved only by talking
 6
 By changing the status on social media, many girls breakup in this strange way too
 ve apane fasebuk kaa states badal detii hai or apane aapako single ghoshit kar detii hai
 7
 saarvajanik rup sekai ladkiyaan doston ke samooh main khadey hokar, behad kathor shabdon main ladke ko brallep kii baat kahati hai
 She misbehaves with the boy and expresses that the boy is the only reason for the end of the relationship

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi today appealed to the voters of Delhi that in view of the functioning of the BJP ruled states, they should bring the BJP in governance here for development and not those who sit on the dharna
 unhone congress or khaskar aap ko nishane par lete hue donon dalon par 'jhooth failaane', 'jhuthe vaayade' karne or parde ke peeche aapas main santh-ganth karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 ' The Prime Minister said that Delhi today needs a 'sensible and sensitive government' and a person at the top post of the state who has an understanding of human values and who has worked for the people of the city
 modi ne kaha ki pichley saal aap or congress ne dilli main sarkaar banane ke liye parde ke peeche aapas main haath milaayaa, lekin phir se chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi ve donon media main kuch sthaan paane ke liye aise jhooth failaane kii aapasi pratispardhaa main jute gaye jinase sansani faile
 In the election meeting of Dwarka here, he said that Delhi needs a government that has the understanding to solve the problems of the national capital
 aap netaa kejariwal kaa naam liye bina unhone unhen nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki agar aise vyakti ko vot diya gaya jo tivi media main jagah paane ke liye 'dharna' dene main vishwaas rakhata ho na ki janata kii samasyaayein sulajhane main to isse dilli ko bahut nuksaan hoga
 He said, 'running the government is a serious task
 sarkarein media main jagah banane ke kaary karke nahin balki logon ke dilon main jagah bana kar chalaai ja sakati hai
 ' is baar chunaav main bijepi ko purna bahumat se jitaane kii apil karte hue modi ne kaha ki agar dilli main bijepi kii sarkaar bani to uske mukhyamantri ko 'modi kaa bhay' hoga or vah kaam karke dikhayega
 He said, 'delhi needs a majority government
 ek aisi sarkaar kii jis par vishwaas kiya ja sake
 If you vote for the BJP government, then whoever is here (chief Minister) will fear Modi and the central government
 lekin koi aisa bana jiske upar koi nahin ho to vah vyakti keval vinaash hi laaegaa

 The OTP was able to run for 18 days, during which many complaints of OTP were received, after which a report was prepared and sent to the Lieutenant Governor

 dilli main congress kii kaman aise samay main sanbhali thi, jab pradesh main party sangharsh kar rahi thijab dilli kii satta sanbhali thi, tab sarkaar or congress ke saamne kai chunautiyaan thimson 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad shila ko congress main haashie par dhakel diya gayarashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli kii 15 saal tak mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit kaa shanivaar ko nidhan ho gaya
 Sheila Dixit died at a time when the Congress is going through its worst phase

 Assembly elections are to be held in this union territory only after a few months
 party ko ummid thi ki shila 1998 kaa itihaas doharaate hue congress ko satta tak pahunchaayengi
 But before the election, Sheela went to make everyone's eyes moist
 loksabhaa chunaav main tisare sthaan par rahi congress ko shila ne sanjivani di
 The Congress had done well in the recent Lok Sabha elections as its state president
 shila dikshit ne swayan bhi vipakshi bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke khilaaf purvi dilli loksabhaa kshetra se chunaav ladaa tha
 However, she herself lost the election and the Congress also failed to open an account
 lekin party south dilli sansadeey kshetra ko chhodkar sabhi chah siton par duusare sthaan par rahi
 Sheila Dixit took the Congress to the top in Delhi at a time when the party was struggling in the state
 dilli rajya kii satta par bhartiya janata party kabiz thi
 During the BJP rule, three Chief Ministers of Delhi were changed

 Under Sheela, the Congress came to power by defeating the opposition BJP in the electoral fray
 dilli kii satta par 15 varsh tak jamaaye rakhe paanvashila dikshit ne jab dilli kii satta sanbhali thi, tab sarkaar or congress ke saamne kai chunautiyaan thim
 Speed up Delhi's development journey with better coordination in power and organization
 unhen aadhunik dilli kaa shilpkaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 The result of this is that Sheila Dixit remained like Angad's feet on Delhi's power
 vipakshi bhaajapa ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main badi jeet hasil kii, lekin dilli kii gaddi se maharoom hi rahanaa padaa
 After the defeat, the Congress was pushed back, then called Balaasan, Sheila was marginalized in the Congress after the defeat in the 2013 assembly elections
 party ne unhen rajyapal banaakar raajnneeti se nepathy main bhej diya tha
 Sheila also took this decision of the party head-on
 shila rajyapal banakar dilli kii raajnneeti se dur ho gayi
 But Ajay Maken and Arvinder Singh Lovely, who took charge of the party after him, failed to strengthen the party
 party ke lagaataar kharaab pradarshan or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mahatvapurn rajya uttar pradesh ke 2017 vidhansabha chunaav se thik purv congress ko shila dikshit kii yaad ai
 The party even announced him as its chief ministerial candidate at one time

 Later, he was given the command of Delhi Congress and this also led to good results
 shila ke netritv main congress loksabhaa chunaav main sattadhari AAP ko pachhadte hue tisare se duusare number par aa gai
 Sheila Dixit, who breathed her last at the age of 81, accepted the tough challenge of getting the Delhi Congress out of a difficult phase even at an age at which people are resting after retirement

 Everyone is giving you tips on how to celebrate Valentine's Day differently this time
 lekin hamaari maniye, to janaab is baar thande pad jaaie
 Sit quietly or have fun with friends
 lekin date ko kar dijie by by
 Let us tell you some special reasons for not celebrating Valentine's Day: 1
 pitayee kaa he khatra:kabhi bajrang dal to kabhi shivasena, koi na koi haath dhokar lover couples ke peeche padaa hi rahata he
 'this is not love but just understand this, there is a river of fire and you have to drown'
 janaab meerut shahar kaa wo kissa abhi dhundhala nahin padaa hoga jab mahila pulicekarmi ne ladke to kya ladakiyon par bhi danda barasaa die the
 So get out on this day carefully
 2
 Save from pocket cutting: Amitabh Bachchan is shouting that diamond jewelery starts from Rs 8000 - but if you have 8000 or 1000 rupees, then put in an FD
 aapkaa partner sach main pyaar karata he yaa karti he to uske liye chatapate momos, nukkad kii chaat or ek icecream bhi chalegi
 On this day, everything from gifts to food and drinks are available at many times more cost
 thodaa sabar rakhiye
 Your love will not end once February 14 is over, will it? Will go on date after a day
 celibrasion ke liye agle din kaa muhoort nikalava lijie!3
 Avoiding Flowers: Once on Valentine's Day, the price of each flower starts touching the sky, and from above those flowers wither in two days
 to apane pyaar ko vaise murajhaane se bachaaie or dil main sahej kar hardam mahaktaa rakhie
 4
 khud ko motaa hone se rokie:chocolate ho yaa kek, vailemtine de par mithe se parhez mushkil ho jaataa he
 Now there is a danger to teeth as well as your figure
 5
 Avoid standing in line: On Valentine's Day celebrations every restaurant gets booked a month in advance
 ab khud sochie ki kya aapmen apane partner ke saath ghanton tak ek restaurant ke baahar line main khadey rahane kaa peshens he?6
 Stand out from the crowd: From Facebook status to red dress - every person is just immersed in Valentine's Day celebrations
 sabake states bhi ek se hi hote hai
 Think of something different
 sara pyaar 14 farvari ko kar lenge, to baaki saal kya karenge?7
 Keep an eye on your mom-dad: Remember that 'mother's Day' and 'father's Day' when your mom-dad's longing eyes were watching you
 unke liye ek toffee bhi naa laane vaale aap aaj apane lover ke liye behtareen party de rahe hai? iske baad nazren mila paaegein aap apane mom-dead se? sabko baraabar kaa darja dijie!8
 Pyaar means not just from 14 February: This topic has always been popular for satire and discussion
 lekin is sachai ko koi nahin jhuthla saktaa ki vailemtine de kaa jo jashn ham aaj dekhte hai wo bazaarwaad kaa hi badla swaroop he
 Love was also there earlier
 jashn pehle bhi hota tha
 But on February 14, such a craze that is seen in every street traveled today, it was not there before
 khud sochiye, ki apane partner ke liye pyaar dikhaane ko yah sirf ek hi din he? saal ke baaki din kya pyaar ke rang main laal nahin ho sakate? is bazaarwaad se kinaaraa kar saadagi se manaaie vailemtine de! The World Economic Forum (WEF) of all world bigwigs, business tycoons has gathered in Davos for 2018

 Davos is a very beautiful place in Switzerland, and it has a gathering of veterans of the world, due to which many people wish that i too could go there
 diggajon ke alaava isamen WEF ke sadsy-partner shaamil hote hai, lekin sach to yah he ki isamen shaamil hona bahut mahangaa sauda he
 The membership fee of WEF is around 40 lakhs to 4 crores, if we talk about Indian rupees
 is kaarykram main shaamil hone vaale rashtradhyakshon, kaarobaari diggajon, kala-samskruti, civil socity jagat ke diggajon se koi shulk nahin liya jaataa
 If other people want to join this program, then first of all it is necessary to be a member or partner
 world iconomic forum kii partnership or sadsyta shulk 60,000 se 6 lakh swiss frank tak he, jo bhartiya rupee ke mutabik 40 lakh se 4 karod rupee tak hota he
 This difference actually depends on your level of involvement in the program
 daavos sammelan main hissaa lene ke liye sadsyta ke alaava or rakam deni hoti he

 One of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's favorite projects, Make in India, has benefited the Defense Ministry immensely
 is abhiyaan ke kaaran raksha mantralay ke kareeb 1 lakh karod rupye bache hai

 pichley teen saal main desh ne teen raksha mantri dekhe hai
 Arun Jaitley, Manohar Parrikar and now Nirmala Sitharaman have consistently stressed on manufacturing in the country
 yahi kaaran he ki diardio kaa bhi role bada he

 Some of these missiles, drdropers, have been in operation for a long time
 iske baavjood bhi diardio ne haal hi main kuch samay main kai or project ke kaam ko aage badhaayaa he
 According to the news received by Mail Today, the work of DRDO has saved a lot of money from the country's treasury
 udhaaharan ke taur par SRSAM jo ki navy kaa project tha, jisaki keemat kareeb 3 xxrep 4 0 karod rupye tak aanki ja rahi thi
 After which the DRDO proposed to make short range air defense missile
 DRDO ke is prastaav ke baad sarkaar ne european missile ko kharidne ke plan ko taala or ise mek in india ke tahat banane kii shuruyaat kii
 The Ministry of Defense is now dependent on foreign countries only for the goods identified
 diardio ne sarkaar ko akaash missile ke letest varjan ko pesh kiya, jise tatkaaleen raksha mantri arun jetali ne sweekaar kiya tha

 The India today-axis-my-india exit poll has revealed an interesting narrative of the thinking of Gujarat voters
 eczit pole se nikali 5 baaten jinase bijepi hogi baag-baag, saath hi 5 wo baaten jo udaayengi party kaa chaiyn
 suhana-suhana 1 for BJP
 congress kaa majboot adivasee kila darkagujrat ke adivasee ilaake lambey samay se congress kaa garh maane jate rahe hai
 From the India Today Conclave 2013 forum, the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi had described in detail the development work done in tribal areas with great sentiment
 narendra modi or amit shah, donon ke liye bada sapana rahaa he ki gujarat ke adivasee votaron par congress kii majboot pakad ko kaise kamjor kiya jaae
 This dream of modi-shah finally seems to be coming true in 2017 elections
 exis-maay-india pole kaa anumaan he ki adivasee voton kaa 48% hissaa bijepi kii jholii main aa rahaa he
 At the same time, Congress seems to get only 42% vote share of tribals
 ye pehali baar he ki gujarat ke adivasee votaron kaa samarthan hasil karne main congress par bijepi badhat lene ja rahi he
 The BJP is projected to get 17 seats out of the 28 seats dominated by tribals in Gujarat
 vahiin congress ko mahaj 11 siton se hi santosh karnaa padegaa
 If the BJP is able to bear the loss in Saurashtra and Kutch, then a big reason for this is the success of wooing the tribals of Gujarat
 2
 For urban Gujarat, Modi still resented the BJP leadership's resentment over the 'hriday Samrat' GST, but in the end the party managed to keep its traditional merchant vote bank and keep it in its fold
 jiesti ko jis tareeke se kaarobaariyon ke gale main utaara gaya usase wo bhannaae jarur, lekin unke liye congress ab bhi adhik badi dushman rahi
 There was a fear in the minds of businessmen that if the Congress comes back to power, then Latif Raj (fear of gangster Abdul Latif, who was active in Gujarat in the eighties-nineties), riots, curfew, anarchy, will not return again
 isi dar ne kaarobaariyon ko bijepi se fevicol ke jod kii tarah chipkaae rakhaa
 Out of 55 urban seats of Gujarat, BJP is going to perform brilliantly by hoisting the victory in 42 seats
 vahiin shahari kshetron kii sirf 13 siton ke votaron kii ore se hi congress par bharosa rakhane kaa anumaan he
 Of the 16 seats in Ahmedabad, BJP is projected to account for 13 seats
 isi tarah surat kii 9 siton main se bijepi ko 8 par vijayshri milti dikh rahi he
 All 5 out of 5 seats in Vadodara's urban area are seen going to BJP
 ek gujarati ke desh kaa pradhanmantri hone ke gaurav ne rajya ke shahari kshetron main votaron par bada prabhaav daalane vaale utprerak ke taur par kaam kiya
 Gujju bhai did not think it appropriate to leave a fellow Gujju when he was speaking in a direct language

 The anger among the successors in keeping the Patidar fire under control had drowned the bjp's loot in the 2015 rural panchayat elections
 chunaav campagne main sawaal jorshor se uthta tha ki kya patidaar andolan kii aag bijepi ko 2017 chunaav main jhulasa degi
 In Saurashtra and North Gujarat, the Patidars are actually seen falling out of the bjp's court
 saurashtra or kuccha kii 54 siton par leuva patelon main 56% or kadva patelon main 60% matadaataaon ne congress ke liye vot kiya
 The BJP could get only 36% support among Leuva Patels and 33% among Kadva Patels
 uttar gujarat kii 32 siton par bhi kamovesh aisi hi surat rahi
 In these seats, Congress led by 6% more votes over BJP
 saurashtra-kuccha or uttar gujarat main bijepi ko jo bhi nuksaan hua uski bharpai usne dakshin or madhya gujarat ke saath ahmedabad kii siton par kar lee
 Talking about 40 seats in central Gujarat, 62% of Leuva Patels and 58% of Kadva Patels voted for BJP
 yahaan congress leuva patelon main mahaj 27% or kadva patelon main 31% votaron kaa hi samarthan hasil kar saki
 35 seats in South Gujarat also had a bumper support position for the BJP
 yahaan patelon main bijepi ko congress kii tulana main 25% se zyada vot milane kaa anumaan he
 4
 matadaata jitna zyada shikshit utana hi bijepi kaa zyada samarthakabijeypi samarthakon ke liye bade utsaah vaali baat ye bhi he ki shiksha or bijepi ke liye matdaan kii ichha ke bich sidhaa sakaaratmak rishta dikh rahaa he
 The axis-my-india poll indicates that the more educated the voter is, the more inclined he is to vote for the BJP
 vahiin matadaata jitna zyada ashikshit he utana hi uskaa congress ke paksh main matdaan karne ke liye jhukaav he
 52% of the state's post graduates and 50% of the graduates indicated to the Axis that they had voted for the BJP
 vahiin congress ke paksh main 36% post graduates or 39% graduates ne vot diya
 Among the illiterate voters of the state, the Congress showed the most support
 ashikshit matadaataaon main 47% ne congress ko vot dene kaa sanket diya he
 Uneducated voters are the only category where Congress has a 5% lead over BJP
 shiksha se judi anya ketegory main bijepi ko 5% se 16% badhat hasil hone kaa anumaan he5
 Massive support for women voters a less-mentioned, but important conclusion of the axis-my-india exit poll is that women have supported BJP in greater numbers than men
 ujjwala yojana jaise kadamon, jisamembipiel pariwaronki mahilaon ko muft rasoi gas conection diya jaataa he, muft elidi balb baante janaa, in sab ne garibon ko laabh pahunchaaya
 It also extended the support base of the BJP
 ye dekhnaa dilachasp he ki matadaataaon ne rajya sarkaar kii ore se chalaai ja rahi kalyaan yojanaon ko yaad karne main ruchi nahin dikhaai
 BJP secured 49% female voters in Gujarat, while 46% of male voters voted for BJP
 kaante kii takkar vaale chunaav main mahilaon ke 3% atirikt voton ne bijepi ko nirnaayak dhar dene kaa kaam kiya
 Danger bell for BJP 1
 rajya ke bijepi diggaj rapatili jameen parexis-maay-india chunaav surveykshakon ne gujarat ke sabhi 182 nirvachan kshetron main jaakar alag alag har kshetra main 200-200 se adhik pratibhaagiyon se baat kii
 The region-wise analysis has revealed alarm bells for some of bjp's biggest faces in the state
 ye unki siton ke parinaam kaa anumaan nahin he balki un siton par ladane vaale netaaon kii lokapriyata kaa paimaana he
 Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel is ranked behind rival candidate Jeevabhai Patel on the scale of popularity
 isi tarah mukhyamantri vijay rupani ko rajkot west seat par virdohi congressi diggaj indranil rajyaguru se lokapriyata main kareeb kareeb baraabar dikhaaya gaya he
 Gujarat BJP President Jitu Vaghani is seen trailing behind Congress's Dilip Singh Gohil in the Bhavnagar West seat
 vahiin botad main bijepi diggaj saurabh patel congress ke di em patel se kaante kii takkar main uljhe hai
 If they are upset in bjp's Surma Maidan, then even if BJP wins Gujarat, then some of the shine of that victory will be lost

 BJP is no longer a magnet for youth; The biggest reason for concern for the BJP is the decline in popularity among the young voters of Gujarat
 anya rajyon ke haalia chunaavon main, yahaan tak ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi desh ke yuvaaon, ummiden sanjone vaale matadaataaon ke liye bijepi chumbak kii tarah sabit hui thi
 But not meeting those expectations could prove to be a ground tunnel for the BJP
 basharte ki gujarat main yuva votaron ne jo trend dikhaaya he wo desh ke anya rajyon main bhi failata he
 Working with Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakore and Jignesh Mevnika Rahul Gandhi in close coordination, a large chunk of young voters have shied away from the BJP
 gujarat main sirf 18 se 25 ke aayu varg main hi congress vot share ke maamle main bijepi ko maat dene main kaamyaab rahi he
 45% of the youth indicated voting in favor of Congress
 vahiin bijepi ko 44% yuva matadaataaon kaa hi samarthan miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Talking about the students of Gujarat, the Congress is in a close competition with the BJP in terms of popularity
 chaatro main bijepi or congress, donon ko hi 43%-43% vot share mil rahaa he
 In the last elections, BJP has got a clear edge over the Congress among the students
 bijepi kii sabase zyada lokapriyata gujarat main 60 varsh se adhik aayu vaale varg main barkaraar he
 This class counts the 'bad old days' during the Congress rule in the state

 Hardik Patel Challenges for the Future Hardik Patel's opponents have been writing political mourning for him for the past several months
 pehle unke khilaaf rajdroh kaa cese darj kiya gaya, phir gujarat se tadi paar kiya gaya, jail bheja gaya
 When the election campaign was in full swing, several sex-cds emerged
 hardik par chhintakashi hui
 The political manipulation was that Hardik would be 'exposed' and the base of his support would shrink
 lekin ek ke baad ek kai badi reliyon ko sambodhit kar hardik ne sabit kar diya ki ve gujarat main bijepi ke liye akele badi chunauti ke taur par ubhare hai
 The Congress is projected to get three seats out of the 4 seats dominated by Kadva Patel in the state
 bijepi ko sirf ek seat milti najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, Congress is projected to lead in 8 of the 12 seats under the influence of Leuva Patels
 yahaan bijepi ke khate main sirf 4 seat jaati najar aa rahi hai
 The BJP has managed to overcome Hardik's challenge in this election, it is because of the non-patidar communities uniting in his support
 haalanki aisa nahin ki hardik kii reliyon main saare yuva patidaar hi hote hai
 To some extent, hearty youth have emerged as a symbol of resentment
 jo bhi nai sarkaar aati he agar wo yuvaaon kii naaraazgi vaale lambit muddon ko nahin sulajhaaye jate to hardik patel agle chunaavon main asal chunauti ban kar saamne aa sakate hai
 Hardik has already indicated to India Today that he is willing to join the Congress if he is given a serious offer
 agar congress aantarik asahmati par kaabo paa kar agle chunaav ke liye hardik ko party kaa cheharaa banaati he to hardik kii khud kii apil or party mashinari 2022 chunaav main bijepi ko tagdi chunauti pesh kar sakate hai
 But in Indian politics, it takes five years
 aise main dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki hardik khud ko agle kuch varshon main kaise sambhalate hai

 gujarat model kii pahunch puure rajya tak nahingujarat main anti inkambency (satta virdohi rujhaan) saurashtra or kuccha, uttar gujarat main sabase zyada dikhi
 bjp's failure to provide drinking water to the citizens of Saurashtra has damaged the party's prospects in the region
 audyogikaran kii drushti se zyada behatar dakshin or madhya gujarat main matadaataaon ne majbootee se bijepi kaa samarthan kiya
 But such enthusiasm for the BJP did not show in the voters of the less developed regions of the state
 saurashtra or kuccha kii 54 siton par congress ko bijepi ke upar 7 siton kii badhat he
 On the other hand, in 32 seats in North Gujarat, the Congress is ahead of the BJP by 4 seats
 agar bijepi dobaaraa gujarat kii satta main aati he nai sarkaar ke liye saurashtra, kuccha or uttar gujarat main vikaas kaaryon par praathamikta se kaam karne kii jarurat hogi
 5
 gramin kshetron kii badahaali asal samasyagaramin gujarat kii baat kii jaae to yahaan bijepi ko congress se kareeb-kareeb barabari kii takkar mili he
 Here the BJP has had to fight the most difficult and exhausting battle
 gujarat kii 127 gramin siton main bijepi ko 64 par badhat he
 At the same time, Congress is ahead in 62 seats
 gramin gujarat main bijepi or congress main sirf do seat kaa hi antar he
 Another figure in the axis-my-india exit poll also shows a similar appearance in rural Gujarat
 gujarat ke kisaanon main bijepi or congress ko baraabar-baraabar yani 45%-45% lokapriyata hasil he
 Except for the farmers, the BJP has an edge over the Congress in all its occupations
 uttar pradesh ke itawa main chal rahe saifai mahotsav main sattarudh samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv or mulaayam singh yadav ke bhai ramgopal yadav bole ki sapa raaj main upi main gundgardee ho rahi he or agar aise hi chalaa to dobaaraa satta nahin milegi
 On this occasion, the head of the party, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that all except the Left parties are opposing us
 hamen sajishon ke bich saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 SP MP Jaya Bachchan said that i tried to bring my husband here, but he did not come
 ‘mere kuch saathi karte hai modi kii tarif’mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki upi main bijepi or congress sajeesh rach rahe hai, jisamen bispi bhi unka saath de rahi he
 Mulayam said that despite all this, we will not give up our principles
 musalamaanon ko lubhaane kii ek baar phir koshish karte hue mulaayam ne kaha ki jaise pehali sarkaar main hamane sarkaar ganvaane kii keemat par masjid bachaane ke liye karsevakon par goli chalavaai thi, vaise hi is baar bhi apane siddhanton se samjhauta nahin karuunga
 Referring to bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, Mulayam Singh Yadav said, "I know some of my colleagues are also praising Modi
" unhone kaha ki modi kii badai or mulaayam ko gaali, jaisi har chunauti ko sweekaar karne ke liye main taiyaar hum
 Mulayam's brother said, 'SP officials are getting hooliganism' Akhilesh ji is not able to work 'on this occasion, Samajwadi Party General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav warned the Akhilesh government that in the election agenda we promised the poor people It was said that the poor would walk with their heads raised and the criminals would tilt their eyes
 lekin hamaari sarkaar ke netaaon ke sangrakshan main apradhi sar uthaakar chal rahe hai
 Ramgopal said that the officers are not being allowed to work, hence the Chief Minister, stop hooliganism or else power will not come again
 ‘koshish ke baavjood nahin laa pai pati amitabh ko’is maukey par sapa saansad jaya pradaa bhi pahunchi
 When Amitabh Bachchan was asked questions related to sharing the stage with anti-up leader Raj Thackeray, he expressed his love for the party
 jaya boleen ki maine amitabh bachchan ko laane kii koshish kii thi, lekin vah nahin aae
 He said that i am his half-mouth, but i cannot leave Akhilesh
 main use oochaaniyon kii bulandi par dekhnaa chaahati hum
 The Pakistan Army and its intelligence agency ISI have a major game plan behind the terrorist violence in Kashmir
 khufia agenciyon ne iskaa khulaasa karte hue bataaya he ki bharat main hamale ke liye pioke main maujuud lashkar or jaish ke aatankiyon ne nayaa plan banaaya he
 Under this, there are plans to try to infiltrate India through Nepal and Gulf countries
 jaankaree ke mutabik, aatankiyon ke farji passport banawaye ja rahe hai taaki inke jariye ve nepal or gulf deshon ke raste aasaani se bharat main ghuspaith kar saken
 For this, many new centers have been built in pok, where recruitment and training of new terrorists has been intensified
 is nai ranneeti ke tahat bade mahanagaron main aatmghaatee hamalon ko anjaam dena he
 According to Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir, it has become clear from the recent incidents that Pakistan is directly inciting the fire of terror in Kashmir
 pioke main pakistani sena ek baar phir se aatankwaadiyon ko ekajute kar rahi he
 Several special warlords of Hafiz Saeed are constantly visiting pok with the help of Pak Army and ISI
 raksha visheshgy ritred major general bhupesh kumaar maanate hai ki pakistani sena khulkar aatankiyon ko madad kar rahi
 a big reason behind this is that before December, Pakistan Army Chief Raheel Sharif wants to increase his tenure by putting pressure on PM Nawaz Sharif
 aatanki ab tak pir punjaal ke dakshin se ghuspaith ko anjaam dete the, jo prakritik lihaaj se adhik sugam he
 For the terrorists, the inaccessible mountainous terrain of North Peel Panjal is full of oddities, which they find overwhelming
 aise main kuch aatanki shiviron ko uttari ilaake main pahunchaakar paak sthit aatanki aakaaon kii koshish badi sankhya menatankwaadiyonko bhejne kii he
 There are now more than 40 terrorist training camps across the border
 2000 se zyada aatanki ghuspaith kii firaaq main hai
 Kriti Sanon, Ayushmann Khurrana and Rajkummar Rao's collection of the film 'bareilly Ki Barfi' did not give a good indication, but breaking the perception, 'bareilly Ki Barfi' made a good collection in the first two days at the box office is
 Movie Review: acchhee kamedi kaa swaad liye he bareli kii barfi'bareli kii barfi' ne shuukravaar ko 2
 42 crores and 3 on Saturday
 85 karod rupye kaa collection kiya he
 The film has so far 6
 27 karod rupee collection kar lee he
 From this, it can be said that the audience is enjoying the sweetness of Banibareli under the direction of Ashwini Iyer Tiwari
 ise junglee pikchars or biaar studios ne produs kiya he
 Let me tell you that the budget of the film is being told to be 20 to 25 crores and at the same time a toilet is already running in many theaters

 rajasthan main basapa ke sabhi 6 vidhayak hue congress main shamilcabinet or sanghathan main ab pherbadal kii lag raheen atakalenrajasthan main mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kii siyaasi chaal se basapa ke sabhi chah vidhayakon ke congress main shaamil hone ke baad rajya kii cabinet or pradesh sanghathan main pherbadal kii sambhaavna dikh rahi he
 There is a discussion in the political corridor that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot wants that political and social balance can be established in the state through a reshuffle
 iconomic times kii report ke mutabik, congress ke halkon main bhi mana ja rahaa he ki rajya main aagaamee nagar palika or panchayat chunaav se pehle pradesh congress kaaryakarini main bhi pherbadal ho sakati he
 Within the Congress, suspense has increased on whether the party is going to get a new state president or a new deputy chief minister in the government
 is vakt rajasthan congress main ashok gahalot ke pratidwandi maane jane vaale sachin payalat pradesh congress adhyaksh pad par hai
 But Ashok Gehlot has fallen heavily on Sachin Pilot after including six mlas in the Congress with his strings
 sachin payalat, up mukhyamantri ke saath congress kii sanghathan kii bhi jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai
 Due to dual responsibilities, there is a demand for full time state president in the Congress
 haalanki payalat donon padon kii jimmedaariyon ko lekar bahut aatmavishvaas se bhare najar aate hai
 He does not appear to be uncomfortable with dual responsibilities
 magar nae siyaasi ghatnakram ke kaaran atakalein lag raheen hai ki sachin payalat se pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad lekar kisi nae chehre ko diya ja saktaa he
 There has been a long-standing demand for one person-one post in the Rajasthan Congress
 chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri ne congress adhyaksh kaa pad chhod diya
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath is also preparing to leave the post of state president
 ab rajasthan main bhi yahi mudda bana hua he
 Sources are telling that the leaders of backward castes are holding the post of Chief Minister and State President in Rajasthan
 aise main party mukhyalay ne brahman, jat, dalit, meena aadi jatiyon ko pratinidhitiv dene ke liye kaha he
 Speaking to The Economic Times, the Rajasthan Chief Minister claimed that there is no link to the cabinet reshuffle with the merger of BSP mlas into Congress
 unhone kaha ki main saubhagyashaalee hum ki bijepi kii koshishon ke baavjood rajya main horse trading nahin hui
 All the six BSP mlas joined the Congress without any condition or bargaining
 kyonki ve yah sunishchit karnaa chaahate the ki rajasthan main raajnneetik sthirataa aae
 Looking at Indian cricket very closely in the last ten months, it is really difficult for me to believe how India's performance during Test matches on foreign soil is going from bad to worse
 itani baat to samaj main aati he ki apane pramukh khilaadiyon kii chot kii vajah se england ke liye uski taiyaari utani umdaa nahin thi
 But there is really no excuse for his helplessness in Australia
 perth ke match ke baad to bhartiya cricket kii ankhen khul jaani chahie thim
 The BCCI should have clearly understood this message because of the seven consecutive Test matches on foreign soil
 yahi ki bharat jis tarah se cricket khel rahaa he, usamen kahin koi baari gadabadi he
 a team which until recently was the number one team in the world, cannot afford to be a lion at home only
 bhartiya team ne jis nirihata ke saath aatmasamarpan kiya he, vah puure asian up-mahadweep ke liye khaasaa sharmindagi bharaa he
 When i arrived in Karachi on 17 January last year after receiving a brief interruption from TV commentary duty in Australia, friends took a dig at me
 vah isliye kyonki maine hi ek baar kaha tha ki bharat ke paas australia main siries jeetne kaa yah behtareen mauka he
 In order to maintain their dominance in the world cricket, there is a dire need for the Asian teams to perform consistently well in the field
 duniya antat champion ko hi pyaar karti he
 Whether it is financial power or politics of power, all these things are used in the meetings held within a room
 vah bhi jab aapaki team maidan par acha pradarshan karne main kaamyaab rahe
 But it has to be said with great sadness that India has failed to maintain its dominance in Australia
 australia main test match to pakistan bhi haara he
 In the days when i was part of the Pakistani team, our team was beaten 3–0 but we were able to carry the game to at least the fifth day
 perth kii haar to kahin se bhi hajam nahin ho paa rahi
 The criticism of the Indian team is completely justified
 mahendra singh dhoni senior khilaadiyon kii kramshah vidaai kii baat kar rahe hai or puri duniya kaa bhi kuch aisa hi maananaa he
 The Indian selectors are now on the wicket, who will have to make some very bold decisions
 rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana or sachin tendulkar mahaan khilaadi hai lekin beete dinon kii bahaduree ke boote par match thode hi jite jate hai
 You have to accept the truth and move forward
 perth or sidney main khel kii dashaon ne ek buudhe ho rahe cricketer kii shaareerik aakshamataaon ko ujagar karke rakh diya
 Humid and silly weather can make anyone tired
 or vaaka par teen varisht bhartiya ballebaaj puri tarah se thake najar aae
 After fielding for two consecutive days, his footwork was not working and he was getting sweaty playing wavy balls
 40 kii ore badhate cricketer ko kai aise sanket milane lagate hai ki ab use antarrashtriya cricket se kinare ho lenaa chahie
 There are also questions about Dhoni's captaincy
 mere hisaab se ve van de ke achche captain hai lekin test maichon ke liye nahin
 Laundry on foreign soil has removed the "cool" captain's fame
 yuva khilaadiyon ko prerit karne main unki naakaami ne ham camentator ko chaunkaaya he
 Vinay Kumar is an example of this
 yah yuva gendbaaj jab david warner ke haathon pit rahaa tha to kitni baar dhoni ne use protsaahit kiya? ek sachin hi the jo gendbaajon se baat kar rahe the
 India needed to keep the atmosphere alive
 team kii dehbhasha hi udhaas or swaarth bhari dikhne lagi thi
 Indian cricket is in a worrying phase
 test captain ke rup main dhoni ke vikalp ke rup main main kisi ko dekh nahin paa rahaa hum
 The coaching staff is also not doing a very good job
 meraa maananaa he ki dancan flechar ke bataur coach saal bhar puure hone par unke kaam kii samiksha ho
 Eric Simmons also needs to work harder on the bowlers
 perth kisi bhi tej gendbaaj ke liye swarg mana jaataa he
 But i was disappointed to see Vinay Kumar throwing the ball at the speed of 120 km in the first over
 laga ki jaise ve varrup kar rahe hai
 Are they playing a Ranji match against Kerala? He should have warmed up before throwing the first ball
 simons ko yah sab dekhnaa hoga
 India will now have to think ahead
 ve vanade maichon par dhyaan kendrit karen
 Players playing in odis will have a better chance to check in Adelaide
 rohit sharma par jarur najar daali jaani chahie

 It now depends on Shahrukh Khan

 "the film, released in 2004, is one of the few films in which Shah Rukh and Sunil worked together
 farah aage kahati hai, "mere paas film ke duusare bhaag ke liye ek bahut acha idia he
 'main Hoon Na' is still shown on all television channels and people still like it

 Anna is hovering over Hazare
 behad khatarnaak khatra
 The danger is his life
 khatra anna par hamale kaa
 Danger to stop Anna's efforts
 khatra anna kii sabha main sajeesh kaa
 Aaj Tak has documents that are disclosed
 dilli police ke rojnaama main darj he ye sajeesh
 Anna Hazare is on the target of many conspiracies, but these conspiracies are not political
 ajtak ke paas hai wo dastavej jinamein darj he anna ke khilaaf rachi gayi ek behad khatarnaak sajeesh
 These documents found from the intelligence agencies of the country and the Delhi Police are recorded in the story of a dreadful murderous conspiracy against Anna
 anna par mandara rahaa tazaa khatra behad bada he
 The power that Anna gets from the crowd is hidden in the middle of that crowd, a deadly threat against Anna
 jin anashnon se anna sarkaar ko hilaa dete hai unheen anshan main afra-tafari failaa kar sajeesh ko anjaam dene kii firaaq main hai anna ke dushman
 For Anna, the purpose and strength is greater than life
 anna ke dushman unki isi takat kaa istemaal unke khilaaf karnaa chaahate hai
 Ramleela-2 has been chosen to carry out the plot
 yani agar sheetasatr main majboot lokapal nahin aayaa or anna phir se disambar 27 se dharne par dilli ke ramlila maidan main baithte hai to unki jaan ko khatra he
 In this horrifying plot of terror, the attacker will not shoot, throw grenades, detonate bombs, nor carry any sharp weapons
 balki wo bheed main afra-tafari failaa kar anna ke najadik pahonchega or phir karegaa waar
 Delhi Police is investigating the conspiracy
 There is a lot of conspiracy against Anna and we are not saying this, but the letter received by the Delhi Police and the complaint lodged in the Delhi Police daily
 or ye chitthee ajtak ke haath bhi lag chuki he
 The crowd which remains Anna's biggest strength so far

 Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) defeated Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) by 5 wickets in the match played on Friday in IPL-12
 kolkata nite rides kii jeet main star olerounder andre rasel kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 kkr's team managed to win the match thanks to Russell's 48-ball innings of 48 runs
 RCB ek vakt jeet kii ore bad rahi thi, lekin rasel ke maidan par utarate hi match kaa pasa palat gaya
 Russell, who is famous for power hitting, said that i do not believe that any cricket ground in the world is big
 mujhe lagata tha ki australia ke ground kaaphi bade hai, lekin jab maine vahaan bhi chakke jad die to uske baad main hairaan ho gaya
 Let us know that when Russell got out to bat, KKR needed 67 runs from 26 balls
 rasel ne iske baad 18wein over main teen chakke or 19wein main 4 chakke jadkar apni team ko shandaar jeet dilaai
 'no ground is big for me', after playing a quick innings of 48 runs, Russell said that some grounds are big in Australia, but i brought the ball to the stand even in those grounds, which also surprised me
 mujhe lagata he ki mere liye koi bhi maidan bada nahin he
 i just believe in my strength
 meri bat speed acchhee he
 i believe in him unhone aage kaha ki lo phul toss ke liye haath or aankh kaa samanvay hona mahatvapurn he, kyonki aisi gendon ko hit karnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Russell hit 7 sixes in the match and with this he has hit 22 sixes in this IPL
 unhone is dauraan 77 gendon kaa saamana kiya he
 Andre Russell said that when i got down to bat, i was confident of winning
 dinesh karthik ne mujhase kaha ki wicket kaa swabhaav dekhne ke liye kuch gend dekh lo
 i was watching the match on TV in the pavilion and i knew how the wicket was playing
 mere dimag main bas yahi baat thi
 He further said that in T20 all you need is a good over

 To say that since MS Dhoni has been associated with Team India, success has been kissing his footsteps but a lot has happened between 4 July 2010 to 4 July 2011 which neither he will ever want to forget, nor Sakshi nor the whole country
 
 pyaar kaa ek saal, 'hamasafar' kaa ek saal, duaon kaa ek saal, kamyaabi kaa ek saal
 Yes yes thik ek saal pehle, puri duniya ko chhakaate hue, sabko chaunkaate hue team india kaa captain apane liye dulhaniya lekar aayaa tha
 At first, everyone was longing for a glimpse of them, and as soon as they appeared, the beauty of this couple was not catching in the eyes
 aaj puraa ek saal ho chukaa he maahi or sakshi kii shaadi ko
 No matter how much they stare from the cameras before the wedding, after marriage, the couple was seen full of joy
 jahaan-jahaan dhoni-vahaan-vahaan sakshi
 Like a glamorous first lady ever
 kabhi safalataa kii prarthana karti pativrata kii tarah
 It would not be wrong to say that such a pair never appeared in Indian cricket
 saajhedaariyon ke is khel main maidan se pare ye ek aisi saajhedaari he jisane ek saal main bhartiya cricket kii tasviir badal di
 Sakshi came into Dhoni's life as Lady Luck
 yun to maahi pehle hi kismat ke bahut dhani the
 But the comfort that this fellow gave to Dhoni under the pressure of international cricket, he appeared again and again in the form of results on the field
 australia ko test or van-de donon main dhul chataana, champions lig main duniya bhar kii tiimon ko patkhni dena, ipel main lagaataar duusari baar champion bananaa
 But the biggest success - winning the world
 aaj maahi vishwa vijeta captain hai or sakshi unki prerana, unki kismat, unki shakti
 Every cricketer dreams of becoming world champion
 is sapane ko puraa hote dekhne ke liye naa jane kitni ankhen saalon se bechaini ke saath intjaar kar rahi thim
 Eventually, the dream came true and that too because of a lady luck
 jis world cap kaa intjaar 28 saalon se puraa desh kar rahaa tha wo aakhirkaar puraa hua 2 april 2011 ko
 The victory of the World Cup was tied on the head of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and behind him was Lady Luck i
e
 his holy witness
 sakshi jo saae kii tarah pichley 9 maheene se dhoni ke har kadam par taal se taal milakar saath de rahi thim
 Now if we don't call it Lady Luck then what to say that Dhoni, who was captaining the World Cup for the first time, made Team India an ODI captain
 ye wo saal tha jab dhoni kii captaini katghare main thi
 Even in the league matches of the World Cup, questions were raised on Team India's claim after seeing the performance of the team
 cricket panditon ne to yahaan tak kahana shuru kar diya tha ki world cap ke nattejey ko dekhakar dhoni kii kismat kaa faisla hoga
 But beyond all the criticism, Dhoni's mind was calm and stable because there were witnesses in his life who stood with him in every difficulty of Dhoni
 sakshi kii maujuudagi ne dhoni main ek nayaa josh bhar diya
 On this occasion, Dhoni showed his captaincy in such a way that everyone was left watching and Team India became world champion
 vishwa cap main pehali baar captaini kar rahe dhoni kaa vishwavijeta bananaa, or shaadi kaa pehla saal - ek sanyog to ho saktaa he par is baat se bhala koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki har kaamyaab aadmi ke peeche ek mahila kaa haath hota he
 So why should Lady Luck be the witness behind this success of Dhoni
 disha paatani ke liye 2018 kaaphi acha biit rahaa he
 Baaghi 2 with Tiger Shroff previously proved to be a block buster at the box office
 is safalataa ke turant baad unhen badi film mili he
 She has got a role in Salman Khan's film India
 disha ke liye ye badi baat he
 He is getting congratulations from the film's star cast
 priyanka chopra ne bhi apane andaaj main disha kaa swaagat kiya he
 Priyanka wrote on Twitter- "bareilly Representative is a lovely thing
 '' bataa den ki disha bhi priyanka kii tarah bareli se hi hai
 Disha made her film debut with MS Dhoni Untold Story

 i can no longer wait to work in the film
 atul sar or ali abbaas sar kii main fain hum
 Priyanka had told in an interview some time ago that she has completed the shooting of the films "A Kid Like Jack" and "easy It Romantic" and that the film is going to return to Bollywood from India
 pati-patni kii bhoomika nibhaayenge priyanka-abhishek? beti banengi jaayra vasimbata den ki bharat ek period film he or isamen 70 saal kaa itihaas dikhaaya jayega
 The film is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar
 film kii relies 5 june, 2019 rakhi gai he
 The government is lethargic and thieves are cool
 jo karodon rupee kaa waite or upkar hi nahin, balki sarkari thekon main bhi ghotaalaa kar rahe hai, vahi bhrasht afasaron kii mileebhagat se mouj kaat rahe hai
 According to government records, between 2015 and 2017, only three companies made a dent of Rs 15 crore in the Punjab government coffers from Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) contracts
 kendriya satarkta ayog (CVC) ke nirdeshon ke ulat single tender ke jariye companiyon or sarkari baabuon kii mileebhagat se ye gorakhdhandha jari he
 Complaints against Arun Enterprises, Tricolite Electrical Industries Limited and Shipra Engineering Works, a firm supplying electrical equipment to several states including Punjab, were also canceled when PSPCL also canceled the orders of some companies including Arun Enterprises
 
 PSPCL kii march main hui meeting ke dastavej ajtak ke paas maujuud hai, jinamein arun enterprijej ke ek lakh four in van boxej ke order radad kiye jane kii baat he
 Despite these ostentatious steps, such companies are running rampant in states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Chhattisgarh, because only the officials responsible for stopping them are meeting these corrupt people
 PSPCL ke ucch padasth sutron ke mutabik ye companiyaan aapas main milakar sabhi tender khud hi uthaati hai, kyonki ye keemat kisi or quality ke upkaran kii bataati hai va supplai kuch or quality vaale samaan kii karti hai
 These companies take tenders by stating the price of copper wire equipment is very low and then supply iron or aluminum wire equipment
 ajtak ke haath lage saboot main yah baat saamne ai ki gajiabad ke dipti kamishnar or vaanijya kar nodel adhikari ne bhi inaki kar chori kii tasdik kii he
 Arun Enterprises, like Punjab, earned a name in Yogi Raj in UP
 janvari 2018 main jari do prashasnic patron se ye baat saaf ho jaati he ki arun interprijej ne sarkaar ko waite bhugtan paanch fisad kii dar se kiya, jabaki asli dar 14
 It makes up 5 percent
 in donon maamle main bhi farjivada karne vaali company ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne kii baat to kahi gai, lekin abhi tak hua kuch bhi nahin
 Interestingly, complaints of this fraud and complicity have been made from the departmental officer to the people holding high positions in the government
 is gorakhdhandhe kii tasdik kii baat ek RTI ke jawaab main bhi di gai he
 However, the action was done in the name of Khan
 aamtaur par android ke mukaable yphone ko zyada sicyor mana jaataa he
 There are several reasons for this, one of which is Apple's policy with which the company never compromises
 isi tarah aipal kii cloud sarvice icloud he jise kaaphi sicyor cloud spes mana jaataa he
 But hopefully after this report you will not consider icloud as secure as you have already believed
 agar aap ye sochate hai ki yphone, mcbuk yaa ypad par internet browj karke uski history delit kar diya or sef ho gaye taaki koi doosraa ye naa jaan sake kii aapane internet par kya dhundha he
 If so, you may be wrong
 delit kii gai history nahin hoti khatm!rus kii hekking tul banane vaali company Elcomsoft ke siio kemutabik aipal safaribraujar kii browjing history icloud par ek saal se zyada tak seve rakhti he
 That is, even if you delete history, it remains on icloud for one year
 Elcomsoft ke siio vladmir katalo ne forbs ko bataaya he ki yphone mekar icloud par tombstone naam se ek khaas spes rakhte hai jahaan dilit kii gai web visits store kii jaati hai
 He has told that he came to know about it when he was looking at the history of Safari browser on his iphone
 iske baad unhone Elcomsoft phone braker software yuj karte hue icloud se data nikaala to unhen pichley ek saal puraani browjing history mili jo pehle unhone delit kar di thim
 They have said, 'we have found that browsing histories live forever on the cloud', according to Forbes Magazine, when they tried to learn browsing history from icloud from Elcomsoft's phone breaker software, as of November 2015, when they received about 7000 records
 is history main website ke yuarel, google search, visit, count or date or time jaisi jaankariyaan thim
 At the moment it is not clear why Apple is doing this
 lekin agar aisa he to yphone yugers ke liye gambhir samasya ho sakati he
 Especially for those users for whom privacy and security are more important
 forbs megsine kii report ke mutabik is khulaase ke baad jaldi hi alcomasoft ke siio or kuch duusare sutron ne kaha ki unki puraani browjing history icloud se khud mit rahi hai
 He claims that Apple is doing this, but there is no statement from the company
 Elcomsoft ke is khulaase par aipal ne kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kiya he
 State Bank of India has given great relief to its customers
 esbiai kii ore se mininum acount balance ke niyamon main badlaav kiya gaya he, bank ke nae niyam 1 oktober 2017 ko lagu ho jaaenge
 Apart from this, old MRP goods will not be available in the market from October 1
 kyon aapke liye jaruri hai ye do nae niyam ?pehla niyam -kam hui bank balance kii limitne niyamon ke tahat bank ne metro centres main minimum acount balance kii limit 5 hajaar rupye se ghataakar 3 hajaar kar di he
 However, there is no change in the limits of urban, semi-urban and rural centers
 ab itnaa lagegaa chargemetro or urban centres category main minimum balance na rakhane par lagane vaale charge bhi 20-50 fisadi tak kam kar die gaye hai
 Now, there will be a charge of 50 rupees in metro centers and 30 rupees in urban centers every month for not keeping minimum balance
 vahiin semi-urban or rural centres par har maheene ab 20 se 40 rupye ke bich charge lagaaya jayega
 Rebating them, Bank said that at present it has 42 crore savings account holders
 inamen se pradhanmantri jandhan yojana or duusari laabhakaari yojana paane vaale 13 karod khataadharakon ko pehle se hi chhot di gai he
 These are the account holders, who do not have to pay monthly charges even if there is no minimum balance in their account
 doosraa niyam -puraane emarpy kaa saamaan nahin milegaek july se GST lagu hone ke baad companiyon ko puraane saamaan ko clear karne ke liye 3 maheene kaa vakt diya tha
 The limit of which is now ending on 30 September

 Earlier on the night of Thursday 17 November, a notice of prohibition was pasted outside the IRF office in Dongri
 notice main zakir nike or unase jude jo bhi maamle darj hai un sabhi kii jaankaree di gai he
 The notice placed outside the institution clearly states that Dr
 Zakir Naik has been encouraging his followers to try and increase the feeling of enmity, hatred and disharmony among various religious communities and groups on the basis of religion

 Statements from those arrested in the terrorist incident or sympathizing with ISIS show that all is inspired by Zakir Naik's statements
 notice main likhaa he paristhitayon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ye mat he ki IRF ko tatkaal prabhaav se ek gaiyr vidhipurna sanghathan ghoshit karnaa jaruri he
 Therefore, now, under different sections of the Unlawful Activities Act 1967, the Central Government declares the Islamic Research Foundation as an unlawful association

 What did not Baghdadi do to shake the world? And the world did nothing to kill Baghdadi
 ek aatanki sanghathan kitna bhi majboot kyon na ho
 But how and for how long can he compete face-to-face with the raging forces of the world? Even if someone is helping Baghdadi secretly, can Baghdadi do this Mahamukabala with that help? Not at all
 to phir aisa kya he iesas ke paas jo pichley kareeb 6 saalon se wo iraq or syria se khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 He made the youth a jihadi, the world remained silent
 usne auraton ko fidaayin banaaya duniya chup rahi
 He poisoned the minds of innocent people
 duniya ne nazarandaaz kar diya
 But now who is doing this, if he is ignored then perhaps the world will not be visible
 ab agar duniya khamosh rahi to puri insaaniyat par khatra mandaraayega or ab chup rahanaa apni hi maut ko daavat dene ke baraabar hoga
 Because Baghdadi has opened the production house of terror directly this time, in which weapons, ammo, grenades, mortars and guns are being made
 bagdadi ke is production house main desi rocket, iidi, grenade or mortar bhare pade hai
 Baghdadi has placed the silencer in front of a gun
 isaki lambaai 20 centimetre or 35 millimetre chaudaai he
 This is the latest tool from the production house of Baghdadi
 ise lagane ke baad bandook se nikalne vaali goli kii awaz kareeb kareeb khatm ho jaati he
 Believe it, Baghdadi terrorists have created a furore by putting it in front of the gun
 ab tak mili khabaron ke mutabik kareeb do darjan irakiyon ko bagdadi ke aatanki silencer vaali bandook se maar chuke hai
 This silencer is mostly used by Baghdadi snipers
 jo sadak par chalate-chalate apane dushmano ko target kar rahe hai
 An Iraqi army officer sitting in a white car was shot dead by ISIS militants with a similar silencer
 sadak par log chalate rahe
 No one even knew that he was killed in the car running with him
 kaali car main savaar ek shaks ke saath bhi aise hi hua
 The Iraqi government is upset with this murderous murder
 uske liye sabade badi mushkil ban gaya he bagdadi kaa ye silencer
 By installing this silencer in the production house of Baghdadi, the henchmen of terror have become inferior
 ab wo aamane saamne kii ladaai ke bajaae chhupakar bina awaz kiye iraqi sainikon ko maar rahe hai
 Although these natives of Baghdadi were in the battlefield for the past several weeks, they have not yet done as much damage
 usase kai guna nuksaan wo apni bandook ke aage is silencer ko lagaakar kar chuke hai
 Baghdadi has given them a decree that neither a single bullet should be fired nor where the bullet came from
 bagdadi ke 'desi' hathiyaar* grenade* mortar* iidi* rocketbagdadi kii is ghaatak taiyaari kaa khulaasa tab hua jab iraq or syria main aatanki thikaane par sena ne kabza kiya
 This place of terror was awash with these indigenous weapons made by terrorists
 pakade gaye hathiyaaron kii banaavat or us par kii gai marking se ye baat bilkul saaf thi ki ye hathiyaar bagdadi ke kaarkaane main hi bane hai
 The US had previously revealed the danger of dangerous chemical weapons at Baghdadi bases
 magar use bhi andaaza nahin tha ki bagdadi keatankikhud hi hathiyaar banane main jute hai

 In a special conversation with IANS, Swami Adhokshajanand said that the work of lobbying to become Prime Minister has already started from Rajnath
 jis vyakti ne upra main bijepi kii puri ikai ko tahas-nahas kar diya vah aane vaale dinon main pradhanmantri banane ke laalach main puri party kaa bhi vinaash kar degaa
 Adhokshajanand said, 'I want to appeal to the people of Lucknow that people like Rajnath are misleading the society
 ek bhagode kii bajaay janata ek shashakt or jameen par rahakar kaary karne vaale netaa ko apana pratinidhi chune
 Asked if Rajnath would get support from Muslims, he said that if people like LK Advani can go to Pakistan and offer a sheet on Jinnah's tomb, then Rajnath can kneel at the rate of Muslims for his personal benefit
 inhone hameshaa se hi baantne vaali raajnneeti kii he
 Swami said, 'rajnath's dream of becoming Prime Minister will never be fulfilled
 ye samaaj ko gumraah karne vaale log hai, inke liye vikaas kaa koi myne nahin he
 Attacking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh simultaneously, Adhokshajanand said, "rajnath and Modi's plans to become Prime Minister will never be fulfilled and if the Sangh is supporting communal people like these, then He is also the biggest traitor
 'swami adhokshajanand ne kaha ki puure desh main jis tarah kii hawa banane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he, vastav main vaisaa kuch nahin he
 BJP will not form government at the center
 hinduon ko gumraah karne waalon ko bhagwaan kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Adhokshajanand said, 'there is no wave in the whole country
 modi or rajnath mugalate main hai
 After the election, their status will be known
 ye donon pradhanmantri banane ke liye aapas main hi ladakar khatm ho jaaenge
 'he said,' bjp's ideology has always been isolationist
 ye log hinduon or musalamaanon ko ladaakar apni raajnneetik rotiyaan sekate rahe hai
 Jagatguru said that his claim in the name of development is hollow
 in logon ne ek baar ram mandir kaa mudda uchhaalkar sarkaar banaai thi, lekin jab sarkaar ban gai tab inhone karodon hinduon ko gumraah kiya
 Later he selfishly abandoned issues like Article 370 and Ram Mandir
 shankaracharya ne modi par kataaksh karte hue kaha, 'jo vyakti apni patni ke prati 'saat pheron' vaala vachan nahin nibhaa paaya, use desh kii janata ko vachan dene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he

 Gorakhpur government hospital became a graveyard for innocent children
 yahaan aspataal kii laaparvaahee ne kai bacchon ko maut kii neend sula diya
 One by one, 33 innocents died inside the hospital
 is ghatana ko jaanane or samajhane gaye yogi sarkaar ke swasthya mantri siddharthanath singh or ashutosh tandon ne aakade pesh kar ghatana par lipa-potee shuru kar di
 The ministers of the Yogi government started the figures in the same way as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did in 2014 on the deaths of children in Malda, West Bengal
 gauratlab he ki malda medical college and hospital main laaparvaahee ke chalate darjanon bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 In the last three years, 600 newborns died here, after which CM Mamta also said that by taking the data, people of the surrounding districts bring their children to the hospital when their condition becomes critical
 isi bajah se unhen bachaa paanaa kaaphi mushkil ho jaataa he
 Like Mamata, this time the Health Ministers of Yogi Government, Siddharth Nath Singh and Ashutosh Tandon also defended their government by presenting statistics
 ghatana kii vajah bataane ke bajaae donon mantri sirf pichley kuch saalon ke aakade bataane main lage rahe
 He also said that in this medical college of Gorakhpur, patients from nearby districts and neighboring states of Bihar and Nepal come for treatment
 itnaa hi nahin jo bachche ilaaj ke liye aspataal laae jate hai, ve kaaphi gambhir haalat main hote hai, jinhen bachaa paanaa doctoron ke liye mushkil ho jaataa he
 In the last few years, Siddharth Nath Singh defended the government by presenting statistics of children who died of Japanese fever
 unhone kaha ki ye ghatana koi pehali baar nahin hui he
 Every year in the month of August, children die like this
 aise hi 2014 main 567 bacchon kii maut hui thi
 During the entire press conference, the two ministers tried to say that there is no fault of the government
 unhone kaha ki 9 agast ko mukhyamantri yogi adityanath gorakhpur aspataal gaye the
 Then he had also visited the hospital, but the problem of supply of oxygen cylinder was not put in front of him
 shuukravaar ko achaanak7
 Beep started at 30 in the evening, that is, the gas supply started to decrease
 vyavastha ye rahati he ki oxigen supplaai kam hone par gas silendar lage rahete hai, to uski vyavastha turant shuru ho gai thi
 In such a situation, it is proved by these pleas of the government that instead of taking responsibility for the death of these innocent children, the government is simply engaged in the marketing of data
 pakistan ke rawalpindi main suraksha balon ke vaahan ko nishaanaa banaakar aatmghaatee hamale main do varisht sainya adhikariyon sahit kam se kam paanch logon kii maut ho gai
