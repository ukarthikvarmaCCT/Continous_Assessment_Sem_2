 If the crop becomes good even after the drought or excess rain, then everyone will be generally happy
 lekin sanyukt raashtra kii ek report main kuch chaunkaane vaali baaten saamne ai hai
 According to a report by the United Nations Environment Program, if plants (crops) get too little water (in drought) or they get too much (excess), they find new ways to live
 fasalon par mausam kii marakrushi visheshgy doctor tii haq ke mutabik aise main fasal ke paudhe aasapaas se milane vaale kisi bhi tarah ke poshak tatv ko apni jadon se sokhne main gurej nahin karte jisaki vajah se mitti main maujudchemicals, pastisidaur minerals bhi jarurat se zyada maatra main paudhon ke bheetar jamaa ho jate hai
 Even in the condition of overgrowth, the chemical or pesticide deposited on the soil surface also collects more in one place from where the plants absorb it
 jaahir he ki zyada maatra main ye fasalon ko insaan or jaanavar donon ke liye jahrili banaate hai
 The impact of the weather on 70 percent of the crops can be gauged by how bad the situation is that this report said that 70 percent of the world's crops will not be able to eat both man and animals if the temperature and weather deteriorates at this speed
 fasalon main jamaa hone vaale jahrile padaarthon main nitrate or prusik acid shaamil hai
 Nitrate is found in large quantities after drought in crops like wheat, maize, barley and soybean
 duusari taraf ativrishti ke baad prusik acid makka, cheri, coffee or seve jaisifasalon main ghaatkastar tak pahunch saktaa he
 Under normal circumstances, plants convert nitrate into protein, but in the event of drought or excess rainfall, they are unable to do so and these chemicals gather in large quantities and make them poisonous
 jahrili fasal jaanavar ke liye bhinuksaandehisase pehle bhi kai studies main ye baat saamne ai he ki agar is tarah kii fasal yaa paudhon ko agar jaanavar bhi khate hai to unke khun kii oxigen kaa vaahak haemoglobin prabhavit hota he or uski oxigen le jane kii kshamta ghat jaati he
 In a country like India where most of the farming is dependent on rain and where drought and excess rainfall are common, this danger can cause even more trouble

 How when all the children unite and curse him for being a Hindu, his best friend also speaks the same language, should it be assumed that the fight in Kashmir is only political That is or could be also called the Battle of religion and society? i do not k if i 27 years do not hate anyone, there is my enemy

 Bajrang Dal activists forcefully raised slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai by slapping an Imam out of the mosque in Hisar, Haryana and slapping him for not doing so
 haryana kii ye ghatana akeli ghatana nahin he, jab kisi khaas sanghathan or vichaardhaara ke logon ne jabardastee bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagavaayen hon
 Earlier in Mumbai, the video of a Muslim autorickshaw driver shouting slogans went viral
 sawaal ye he ki jo log bharat mata kii jai ko lekar andolit hai, unhen pataa bhi he ki bharat mata aakhir hai koun? doosraa sawaal ye ki kisi se jabaran bharat mata kii jai bulawaane se aakhir koun sa makasad hal hota he, isse rashtrawaad majboot hota he yaa sampradayik ekta?ukt sawaalon ke pariprekshya main mahatma gandhi or pandit jawahar laal nehru ke vaktavy or lekh mahatvapurn hai
 This helps us understand the significance of the definition of Bharat Mata and the slogan of Jai
 nehru ne bataaya tha, koun hai bharat mata?pandit nehru ne discovery of india main spasht rup se is bare main likhaa or samajhaayaa he
 Pandit Nehru arrived in a village on a tour
 yahaan unke swaagat main graminon ne bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagaae
 On this, Nehru questioned the villagers that the Bharat Mata Ki Jai slogan, can you tell who this Bharat Mata is

 After this, Pandit Nehru told that our mountains, rivers, forests, land, forest wealth, minerals
 
 
 hi bharat mata hai
 He said that if you raise slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai, then you hail our natural resources
 nehru kaa kahana he ki hindustan ek khubasurat mahila nahin he
 Hindustan or India are the bare and hungry farmers
 ve na to khubasurat hai, na dekhne main achche hai, kyonki garibi acchhee cheez nahin he
 That's a bad thing
 isliye jab aap 'bharat mata kii jai' kehete hai, to yaad rakhie ki bharat kya he, or bharat ke log nihaayat buree haalat main hai- chaahe ve kisaan hon, majdoor hon, khudara maal bechney vaale dukandaar hon, or chaahe hamaare kuch noujvaan hon
 This is India
 bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaana inaki hi jai kaa naaraa lagaana he
 Thousands of Hindus chanted the slogan of Allah Hu Akbar on 8 September 1920, in an article written in Young India, Mahatma Gandhi had appealed to raise three slogans to strengthen unity among the people of the country
 ye the- allaah ho akbar, bharat mata kii jai or hindu-musalmaan kii jai
 Gandhi had said that there should be no problem in arranging these three slogans in a systematic way
 haalanki yang india ke ek-duusare patr main mahatma gandhi ne likhaa he ki kisi par bhi koi naaraa thopa nahin janaa chahie
 Mahatma Gandhi's emphasis on social unity was that no one should have any trouble in raising the slogan of Allah ho Akbar because it means that God is great
 gandhi kii apil par swatantraaa andolan ke dauraan hajaaron hinduon ne vande maataram or allaah ho akbar kaa naaraa ek saath lagaaya
 Gandhi also said that the slogan of Bharat Mata ki Jai is incomplete without the slogan of Jai of Hindu Muslims
 yani agar aap bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa lagaate hai, to aapako hindu musalmaan kii jai kaa naaraa bhi lagaana chahie
 Mahatma Gandhi always stressed the plurality of ideas and social unity and not his emphasis on any one slogan

 Four smartphones from Samsung's flagship series - Galaxy S10, S10 Plus, S10e and S10 5G
 in sabhi smartfones ko mobile world congress ke dauraan shokes kiya gaya
 Yes, Galaxy Fold was also kept for the showcase, but it was not allowed to be used
 baat karte hai disple kii
 We have used these smartphones for a while, we can say that their display is much better than the previous version and their rival may have problems with it
 kyonki disple ke maamle main samsung pehle se hi king rahaa he or is phone ke saath company ne or bhi kamaal kiya he
 Let us tell you the real life experience of the phone which has been allowed to use
 pehali najar main ye sabhi smartfones achche lagate hai
 Design and Build is Quality Solid
 inhen hold karnaa bhi kaaphi aasaan he
 If you want a compact smartphone that fits in your hand and does not have any sense in quality, then Galaxy S10e is for this
 ye chota he or haath main feet baithta he
 Build quality is also good
 bharat main samsung ke ye teenon smartfones 6 march ko launch ho rahe hai
 Prices have been announced and their pre-booking is also on
 Galaxy S10 Plus sidhe taur par iphone XS Max ko takkar dene kii kshamta rakhata he
 This is because the Infinity o display given has HDR 10+ certification
 yuj karne main kaaphi shandaar lagata he
 The battery is also big and the 16 megapixel rear wide angle lens provided in it adds four moons to its photography
 is smartphone main dynemic super amolade infinity o disple di gai he
 We clicked some pictures, recorded videos, and with both cameras you can record 4K videos
 yujar interphes kii baat karen to ye vaaki badhiya he
 Earlier the company's own user interface was quite heavy, but Samsung has changed it and the Samsung One UI has also been optimally optimized
 parformens kii baat karen to isamen top ke hardware die gaye hai
 But we will talk about user experience here
 phone main koi lag feel nahin hota, kai eps ek saath chalaae, videos or strimming eps ek saath chalaane main koi dikkat nahin he
 Gaming, Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality based games run without lag
 disple behatar hone kii vajah se isamen gaming kaa alag expirience he
 Artificial Intelligence Best Samsung's own virtual assistant Bixby also works well and slowly the company is customizing it with a smartphone like this
 aisa lagata he kuch saal main ye lagbhag har samsung flagship yujar ise yuj karenge
 It is not used much now
 samsung ke in smartfones main headphone jaik hai, micro esady card slot he or yuasabi tip si port he
 And that's good
 kyonki ab tak bina headphone jaik vaale phone main logon ko dikkatein to hoti hi he
 The bottom line is that after using all the smartphones of the Galaxy S10 series, you feel that you have used an advanced and new smartphone
 khaas kar iskaa camera or parformens
 One can say that no revolutionary changes have been made in the design and the company is following its signature pattern
 ye bhi baat sahi he ki abhi ham ise bina rivyuu ke puri tarah jaj nahin kar sakate hai
 From battery testing, camera testing to performance, you will read in detail on our website in review

 Sources said that the current MP from Varanasi seat Murli Manohar Joshi asked Rajnath Singh in the presence of Narendra Modi if Modi will contest from Banaras? Joshi said, who is spreading this news and if it is not, then why are they not denied? vahiin sushamaa swaraj ne daagi netaaon se gathbandhan karne ke mudde par poocha ki ye faisle koun kar rahaa he? rajnath ke yah kehane par ki rajya ikaayiyon ke siforeeshon par aisa ho rahaa he, jis par sushamaa ne talkhi se poocha ki phir dilli main netaa kisalie baithe hai?

 Every year, toppers scam, pictures of cheating bets in matriculation and intermediate exams have become common in Bihar
 sawaal magar yah uthta he ki aakhir buniyadi str par hi kya kami he jisaki vajah se chaatro ko sahi shiksha nahin mil paati he or pariksha main paas karne ke liye unhen nakal ke saath-saath anya tarkiben bhi lagane padate hai
 Till date, the team reached Muzaffarpur town, 70 km from Patna, to assess the problems that students face in Bihar
 hamen jaankaree mili thi ki shahar ke bichobich ek aisa skool he jahaan par skool ke naam par sirf ek cameraa he or usee ek kamare main kai kakshaen ek saath chalati he
 To take stock of this, we reached the Bahlkhana area of the city
 yahaan pahunchane ke baad ham skool kii imaarat dhund rahe the magar vah nahin mili
 We just got a room in Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation, where a government school named Government Primary School runs
 skool main pehali se lekar paanchavi tak ke chaatr padhai karte hai
 In all, the school has 73 students and girls and 3 female teachers
 chaunkaane vaali baat thi ki kabadkhane jaisaa yah cameraa ek skool tha jahaan par ek saath 5 kakshaen chalati he
 But soon we came to know that this school like junkyard is also very dangerous
 khatarnaak isliye kyonki isi kamare ke andar in sabhi bacchon ke liye madhyanh bhojan banaaya jaataa he
 That is, in this one room where 73 children study, midday meal is made for children daily at the same place, and every day children keep their lives on their palm and study here
 yah baat aasaani se samajhane vaali he ki jis kamare main chulhaa jala kar khaanaa banaaya jaataa he vahaan par koi bhi durghatana kabhi bhi ho sakati he
 Talking to the headmistress of this school, Anita Gupta, she said that when she came to this school in 2007, the condition of the school was still the same and even after 10 years, the condition of the school is the same today
 anitha gupta kahati hai ki yah dikkat skool ke bachche or shikshakon donon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab he
 Anita Gupta says that the smoke that arises due to the preparation of midday meal daily makes it very difficult for the children
 mahjabeen ansaari jo paanchavin kaksha main padhati hai vah kahati he ki kamare ke andar himedhyanabhojan banane kii vajah se unki ankhon main jalan hoti he or unhen apni jaan kaa khatra bhi mahasoos hota he
 Mahazbeen says that because of having 5 classes together in the same room, he does not understand what he is taught many times
 is khastahal skool ko lekar aaj tak ne jab mujffarpur ke jiladhikari dharmendra kumaar singh se baat kii to unke paas bhi aashwaasan dene ke sivaa or koi vikalp nahin tha
 The District Magistrate said that a search for land is going on to build a building for this school and as soon as the district administration gets any land, a school building will be built on it
 to baat saaf he !! rajya main jis skool ke paas apana bhawan bhi naa ho or ek hi kamare main 5 kakshaen chalati ho vahaan par kis tareeke se padhai hoti hogi or vahaan ke bacchon kaa bhavishya kya hoga yah samajha ja saktaa he
 jdu's national executive meeting in Delhi ended
 tamaam bade netaaon kii maujuudagi main party ne nitish kumaar ko 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se jude rajnatik faisale lene ke liye adhikrut kiya

 nitish kumaar phir doharaaya ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja hamaare liye ahm mudda he
 Nitish Kumar said in his speech that no talks have been held on seats yet
 unhone kaha ki sabase karaab sthiti main bhi jediu ko 17 pratishat vot mila tha
 Nitish says that he who ignores us in politics will himself become ignorant in politics

 This meeting of JD (U) is being held in Bihar in the middle of a row over seats from its ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 aapako bataa den 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon main jad(you) akele ladate hue maatr 2 siton par hi apni jeet darj kar pai thi
 The BJP had won 22 seats
 lekin jedy(you) lagaataar is baat kii maang kar rahi he ki bihar vidhansabha main uski takat ko dekhte hue zyada siten di jaae
 Read this: 'politics' to pressure BJP, nitish-paswan's meeting today, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is being annoyed by bjp's 'big brother' attitude and in this order, he has enough to call former Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav
 Have given hints
 bihar ke badalte raajnneetik ghatnakram ko bhaanpate hue, bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah 12 july ko patna ja rahe hai, jahaan unki mulaakaat nitish kumaar se bhi hogi
 Probably during this meeting, Nitish will keep his mind on what his role will be in the NDA for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ullekhneey he ki jad(you) ab bihar se baahar apane pair pasaar rahi he
 So in this meeting, Nitish can also talk to the state heads of the party about the 'bihar Plus' scheme
 jad(you) is saal ant main chaar rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon me apane pratyaashee khadey kar sakati he
 Therefore, in the presence of JD (U) units of 22 states, Nitish Kumar's address to the National Executive today is considered as important in the current political developments

 When he searched Harsha's note book, e-mail and Facebook post, it was found out that his 15-year-old son now writes his words in code, not in common words
 yah aparichit jubaan thi
 Codes in numbers and letters, cryptic words and some slang words that seemed to be from a secret mission
 saathiyon kaa ek jhund bear kii botalon ke bich baitha tha or post par Ridneck, pichhali raat MWI ho gaya tha, PIR TTYL jaise akshar chamak rahe the
 When unaware of Harsh's cyber world, the architect's mother could not solve the mystery of these words, he put them on some websites that show the Facebook code of the teenagers
 tab unhen isamen chhipe gupt sandesh padhgaye ko mili-‘‘shame aati he,’’ ‘‘kal raat nashe main tali ho gaya tha’’, ‘‘parents kamare main hai,’’ baad main baat karte hai

 Like Harsh, millions of teenagers on Facebook and Chaut across India are learning a new language related to code, a language that is unknown to not only their parents but sometimes even the generation immediately before them
 esoes signal se lekar drugs ke liye code or sex kii baton ke liye sankshipt shabdon vaali yah nai language ban rahi he or duusare logon ko chakaane ke liye he
 They distribute 'E' (ecstasy drug), ask for 'juice' (weed), say to hot girls in the chute window, TDTM (talk dirty to me ie talk dirty to me) and instantly after declaring it That they are 'legal' (age 16 and allowed to have sex)
 saaf kehete hai, IWSN (ai waant sex nau yani mujhe sex karnaa he)

 kaha jaataa he ki pyaar se insaan duniya jeet saktaa he or nafrat apano ko bhi dur kar detii he

 Vandana Chawla, Principal of New Era Public School says, "all teachers are devoted to teaching
" lekin ek baat hamane mahasoos kiya he ki bachche usee shikshak ko adhik pasand karte hai jo unhen pyaar se padhaaen
 Children easily assimilate what such teachers teach to children
 ’vandana kahati hai ‘lekin shikshak agar daant fatkaar kar bachche ko padhaate hai to donon ke bich ek duuri ban jaati he or bachche vishay ko samaj nahin pate
 As a result, children pay less attention to the subject and their grip on it also becomes weaker
 ’manovigyaani madhu priya kahati hai ‘yah sach he ki bacchon ko pyaar se samajhaana aasaan or unke liye hi behatar hota he
 The reason for the low marks of the child in a subject is due to the lack of interest in the subject
 us vishay ke shikshak kaa vyavhaar bhi myne rakhata he
 If the teacher who rebukes the teacher will teach the child, the child will be scared
 agar bachche ko kuch samaj main na aaye, to vah shikshak kii daant ke dar se puch bhi nahin paaegaa
 As a result the child may be weak in that subject

 us samay congress ke netaaon kaa kahana tha ki rahul gandhi kaa vivaadit sthal par janaa thik nahin hoga
 Priyanka Gandhi is going to Ayodhya at a time when the Supreme Court has set up an arbitration committee and talks are being held with all the parties regarding the disputed site

 Millions of people living in Todapur, Dasaghara, Mochibagh, Jhilmil and Tahirpur Raza villages are getting ownership of their homes after a hundred years
 in paanch gaanv kii jameen dilli main nai dilli yani lutian jone banane ke liye 1911 main adhigrahit kar lee gai thi
 Like Raisina and Malcha villages, these villages too had to be relocated, but the British did not need land and these five villages survived
 lekin yahaan rahane ke liye inhen angrejon ke banaae gaye najul vibhaag ko ek aana prati chulhaa tex dena padataa tha
 Due to this, its name became Chulha Tax
 haalanki aazaadee ke baad 1984 tak is tex ko vasula jaataa tha, iske baad tex bahut kam hone ke chalate nigam ne inhen vasula janaa band kar diya
 Since then, Chulha tax paying villages have been fighting for the ownership of their homes
 todapur ke numberdaar parivaar se taalluk rakhane vaale braham yadav bataate hai ki unke dada ko chulhaa tex vasuul kar angrejon ke khajaane main jamaa karwaanaa hota tha
 The British had taken away the land from us and had to pay even wages to pay this tax
 agar unke numberdaar dada is tex ko vasuulne main naakaam rahete to unki tehsil main pitayee tak karwaai jaati thi
 However, DDA is charging fees for giving ownership to the stove tax payers
 jin logon ke naam par chulhaa tex kii parchiyaan he unhen 575 rupee meter ke hisaab se paisa didie vasulegaa, jabaki jinhone chulhaa tex waalon se ghar kharida he unhen 3500 rupee meter ke hisaab se fees deni padegi
 Kulbir, who lives in Dasghra village, is angry with this fee
 vah kehete hai ki jinke paas 200 gaj yaa usase zyada bada makaan he, unhen lakhon rupee fees bharani padegi
 First, 1300 acres of land in our village were acquired
 ab makaan ke malikana haq ke badale paise liye ja rahe hai
 Todapur and Kasaghra villages are just five km from Rashtrapati Bhavan
 lekin in gaanv ke ek taraf sena kaa signal kor he, to duusari taraf pusa agriculture institute
 There is no land left in the village, in such a situation, the ownership of these villages will increase the price of these villages, but it is very difficult to build new houses

 Bihar Food and Consumer Protection Minister Shyam Rajak, who was once a favorite of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, accused him of mastering the 'gimmick'

 Students say that after so many years, the railway vacancy came and the age limit was reduced from 30 to 28
 isse teen se chaar saal se taiyaari kar rahe chaatro kii neend ud gai he
 They are very upset
 unki sankhya hazaron main he
 Not all of them will be able to take the exam
 rail mantri inase ek baar mil len to pataa chal jayega ki in naujavaanon kaa dard kitna gaharaa he
 On 3 February 2018, Centralized Employment notification has been released
 sahaayak loko payalat or or technician catagori ke liye
 There is a vacancy of 26,502 posts
 is baar farm bharne kii umr seemaa 30 se gata kar 28 kar di gai he
 When the recruitment for this post was released in 2014, the maximum age limit was 30
 yahi nahin, is baar farm bharne kii fees 500 rupee rakhi gai he
 When the vacancy came in 2014, the fee for filling the form was Rs 40
 40 rupee kaa farm 460 rupee mahangaa ho gaya jabaki aavedan online ho rahaa he
 Online should be cheap but became expensive
 har baar ke farm main likhaa hota he ki seat kii sankhya ghatai badhaai ja sakati he so is baar bhi likhaa hua he
 4000 seats were reduced after the final phase in the 2015 examination
 rail mantri ko dekhnaa chahie ki umr seemaa main do saal kii katautee karne se naujavaanon par kya asar padataa he
 All mps should also keep this problem with the Railway Minister
 dilli ke mukherjee nagar main vibhinn parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye yahaan kunjee waalon, kitabon kii duniya, akhbaar or news channelon kii duniya se alag he
 There are many books related to the examination of Railways, the forms are being sold

 The concentration of preparation is seen on his face
 koching chalaane vaale bhi kah rahe hai ki railway kii jo bhartee nikali he usamen adhiktam umr seemaa 30 varsh honi chahie thi, use ghataakar 28 saal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 This has left thousands of students who have been preparing for many years
 railway kii naukari ke liye desh main kitne lakh noujvaan taiyaari karte hai, ham or aap nahin jaan sakate hai
 If the TV space was not filled with nonsense spokespersons, today you would have seen this face of India on TV
 hamane bihar chunaav ke dauraan aara shahar main dekha tha ki noujvaan kaise ped ke neeche baithkar railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai
 These youngsters cannot afford coaching, so they gather and prepare under the tree
 maine apane jivan main aisa drishy nahin dekha tha
 In a college building in Ara, young men were preparing to bow down
 hamen dilli main baithkar pataa bhi nahin chalata he ki naukariyon ke liye bharat kaa noujvaan kis maansik, aarthik or manouvaigyanik halaat kaa saamana karata he
 Students say that restoration has come after so many years
 ham sab is bhartee kii aas main kai maheenon se taiyaari kar rahe hai or ab umr ke kaaran imtahaan se pehle hi baahar ho gaye
 Our preparation went in vain
 ye tasviir bataati he ki noujvaan naukari kii aas main dadhichi rishi kii tarah haddi galaa rahe hai
 Along with this, their parents are also losing their earnings
 aap jab in naujavaanon ke nazadik jaaenge to pataa chalegaa ki is vakt wo kya sunanaa chaahate hai
 On 2 March 2017 i wrote a blog
 blog kaa aadhaar tha times of india main chhapi pradeep thakur kii report
 There was news that two lakh jobs have been reduced in Railways
 agar do lakh naukariyaan kam hongi to in naujavaanon par kya beetegaa, kya inhen bataaya gaya he ki aap apni taiyaari na karen, kyonki sarkaar naukariyaan kam karne vaali he
 In my opinion, they should be told
 2 march 2017 ko maine railway kii bahaali par ek blog likhaa tha
 Many people used to get annoyed even before reading my blog, but now after three to four years, my writing can also be evaluated whether what was written was on time or not, how much was right and how wrong
 is blog kaa aadhaar tha us rose times of india ke aakiri pannon par chupake se chhapi pradeep thakur kii report
 Pradeep wrote in his report that from 2015 to 2018 there will be no change in the manpower of the railway
 kya vaaki aisa hua? iske liye hamane bajet patr main die gaye aankadon ko hi aadhaar mana he
 If you want, you can check this figure by clicking the link of the budget
 expendichar profile main part 4- establishment and public enterprijes ke pehle section main janaa hoga
 We checked with the 2014 budget
 railway main naukariyon kii sankhya 13 se hi kam hoti ja rahi he
 It remains the same from 2014 to 2018
 railway ke mainpavar kii sankhya main koi change nahin he
 In the 2014-15 budget, as of 1 March 2013, manpower was - 13,07,109 2015-16 ke bajet main 1 march 2014 tak mainpavar tha- 13,33,966 In the 2016-17 budget, as of 1 March 2015, manpower was - 13,08,472 2017-18 ke bajet main 1 march 2016 tak mainpavar tha- 13,08,472 The manpower in the 2018-19 budget as of 1 March 2017 was- 13,08,472 teen saal se railway ke mainpavar main koi vruddhi nahin he
 The loss of jobs was started from the time of UPA
 1 janvari 2014 ko manzur kshamta yani sanctioned strength tha 15 lakh 57 hazaar
 Even then only 13 lakh seven thousand people were working
 is tarah pichley kuch saalon main aap kah sakate hai ki railway main do lakh naukariyaan kam hui hai
 It is a matter of statistics, so there should be a scope for making mistakes
 railway kii naukariyon kii taiyaari kar rahe chaatro ko saansad hi jaakar bataa sakate hai ki aap taiyaari na karen
 Two lakh jobs have been reduced in Railways
 vaise bhi paardarshita kaa zamana he, saansad ke munh se sunakar ki do lakh naukariyaan kam hui hai, bharat kaa koi bhi noujvaan deshhit main kuch nahin bolegaa
 Will clap suresh prabhu jab rail mantri the tab unhone 12 disambar 2014 ko rajyasabha main ek bayaan diya tha ki railway main sangraksha se jude 1 lakh 2 hazaar pad khaali hai
 i don't think 1 lakh vacancy has come since then
 rail mantri chahen to das minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 Then all the mps can read that tweet to the youth of their respective areas
 railway kii naukariyon par march 2017 ke baad oktober 2017 main ek or blog likhaa
 By then the minister had changed in rail
 suresh prabhu kii jagah piyush goyal aa chuke the
 We have seen what statements Piyush Goyal has made so far on employment on September 30, and how it has been published
 kai baar hota he ki vahi vaale topic ke kaaran aise bayanon par thik se charchaa nahin ho paati he
 In district editions, such news is smaller than a printed single column
 29 oktober 2017 ko bayaan chhapata he ki railway paanch saal main 150 arab rupee kaa nivesh karegaa or 10 lakh atirikt rojgaar paidaa karegaa
 No one knows concretely what this additional employment is
 jab 2013-2018 ke bich railway ke mainpavar main koi badhotaree nahin he to kis hisaab se 13 lakh mainpavar vaale railway main das lakh log or jud jaaenge
 Was it a deliberate statement or simply said and the headline was printed
 1 oktober 2017 ko rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah doosraa bayaan mila jisamen ve daawa kar rahe hai ki ek saal ke bheetar das lakh rojgaar paidaa ho sakate hai
 The Minister of Railways says the rail ecosystem instead of railways
 yah sidhe-sidhe railway main job nahin hoga magar railway ke iko system ke bheetar ek saal ke bheetar kam se kam 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar sakate hai
 It has been 5 months since Piyush Goyal became the Railway Minister, so has more than 4 lakh jobs been created in the railway ecosystem? If 10 lakh jobs can be created in less than 12 months, then about 4 lakh 20 thousand jobs are created in 5 months or not
 yaa yah bhi hedline bhar ke liye tha
 The headline appeared, good feeling came and then the news disappeared
 yah khabar saare pramukh akhabaaron main chhapi thi
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's statement talking about creating one million jobs is also strange
 7 oktober ke iconomik times or vir main mantri ji kaa bayaan chapa he
 At the World Economic Forum, Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that 200 big companies of India are reducing jobs every year
 agar ye 200 badi companiyaan naukari nahin dengi to puure samaaj ko saath lekar chalanaa kathin se kathin hota jayega
 Then Piyush Goyal said that what Sunil Mittal has said that jobs are getting low is a very good sign
 sachai yah he ki kal kaa yuva naukari khojane vaala nahin hoga, vah naukari dene vaala bananaa chahta he
 The country wants to see more and more youth as entrepreneurs
 naujavaanon ko hi sochna chahie ki kahin unki soch or sarkaar kii soch main antar to nahin aa gaya he
 The government wants to see you as an entrepreneur and you are wasting time seeking jobs from him
 railway main naukariyaan aa nahin rahi hai or noujvaan naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage hai
 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker
 hamase naukari na maangen
 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker
 sikar yani rajasthan vaala sikar nahin, angrezi vaala sikar yani naukari maangane vaala nahin, naukari dene vaala bana rahe hai
 Amit Shah is Sirius this time
 unhone is baar pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko jumala nahin kaha
 When Kishore Ajwani questioned the matter of giving 15 lakhs to everyone in the elections, Amit Shah said that it was a jumla
 pradhanmantri ne jab zee news ke sudhir choudhary se kaha ki pakora tal kar jo 200 rupye kamata he wo bhi to rojgaar he
 Do not know why some people were hoping that Amit Shah would also speak this time that it was a jumla
 magar amit shah ne is baar jumala nahin bolaa
 This means that they are very serious about frying or frying dumplings
 lakhanu ke kuch noujvaan naukari dene nahin, maangane ke liye lakhanu main jamaa hue
 Our colleague Kamal Khan reports that during the Akhilesh government, interviews of 40,000 people had either taken place or were about to take place, but the Yogi government stopped the allegations as soon as they came
 sarkaar ko aae 11 maheene biit gaye hai, lekin na to isaki jaanch hui he na hi inhen naukari mili he
 For three years, politics has created so much debate about the tricolor on the news channels that now even the youth have understood its strength
 inke haathon main tirangaa tha or maang thi ki 9 maheene tak kisi ko adhinsth chayan seva ayog kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya
 The court also rebuked
 itani deree se hamaara jivan barbaad ho rahaa he
 These are performances that never reach the screen of the media, even if they reach, they are put on some edge
 agar ye noujvaan pakora bech rahe hote to aaj inkaa puraa din ek maamuli naukari ke liye pradarshan karne main karaab nahin hota
 By the way, our focus is not on Pakoda, it is on this, so the examinations are being done, for which people are working in the selection commission, a personnel minister is happy, what is the result of them all

 Sometimes a debate is necessary, but it is shameful for our society to search and debate it
 ab ham kuch naam lenge taaki chaatro ko bharosa ho jaae ki unki shikaayatein pahunch gai hai

 We are not going to postpone
 naukariyon par hamaari 12veen series ho gai he
 So many mails have come, now we will have to restore the postal officer
 kai log tabadale ko lekar bhi likh rahe hai yaa naukariyon ke vivaad ko, pleez aisa na karen
 We will try to come to everyone, let's see
 yahi nahin, is baar farm bharne kii fees 500 rupee rakhi gai he
 When the vacancy came in 2014, the fee for filling the form was Rs 40
 40 rupee kaa farm 460 rupee mahangaa ho gaya jabaki aavedan online ho rahaa he

 In my opinion, they should be told
 2 march 2017 ko maine railway kii bahaali par ek blog likhaa tha
 Many people used to get annoyed even before reading my blog, but now after three to four years, my writing can also be evaluated whether what was written was on time or not, how much was right and how wrong
 is blog kaa aadhaar tha us rose times of india ke aakiri pannon par chupake se chhapi pradeep thakur kii report
 Pradeep wrote in his report that from 2015 to 2018 there will be no change in the manpower of the railway
 kya vaaki aisa hua? iske liye hamane bajet patr main die gaye aankadon ko hi aadhaar mana he
 If you want, you can check this figure by clicking the link of the budget
 expendichar profile main part 4- establishment and public enterprijes ke pehle section main janaa hoga
 We checked with the 2014 budget
 railway main naukariyon kii sankhya 13 se hi kam hoti ja rahi he
 It remains the same from 2014 to 2018
 railway ke mainpavar kii sankhya main koi change nahin he
 In the 2014-15 budget, as of 1 March 2013, manpower was - 13,07,109 2015-16 ke bajet main 1 march 2014 tak mainpavar tha- 13,33,966 In the 2016-17 budget, as of 1 March 2015, manpower was - 13,08,472 2017-18 ke bajet main 1 march 2016 tak mainpavar tha- 13,08,472 The manpower in the 2018-19 budget as of 1 March 2017 was- 13,08,472 teen saal se railway ke mainpavar main koi vruddhi nahin he
 The loss of jobs was started from the time of UPA
 1 janvari 2014 ko manzur kshamta yani sanctioned strength tha 15 lakh 57 hazaar
 Even then only 13 lakh seven thousand people were working
 is tarah pichley kuch saalon main aap kah sakate hai ki railway main do lakh naukariyaan kam hui hai
 It is a matter of statistics, so there should be a scope for making mistakes
 railway kii naukariyon kii taiyaari kar rahe chaatro ko saansad hi jaakar bataa sakate hai ki aap taiyaari na karen
 Two lakh jobs have been reduced in Railways
 vaise bhi paardarshita kaa zamana he, saansad ke munh se sunakar ki do lakh naukariyaan kam hui hai, bharat kaa koi bhi noujvaan deshhit main kuch nahin bolegaa
 Will clap suresh prabhu jab rail mantri the tab unhone 12 disambar 2014 ko rajyasabha main ek bayaan diya tha ki railway main sangraksha se jude 1 lakh 2 hazaar pad khaali hai
 i don't think 1 lakh vacancy has come since then
 rail mantri chahen to das minute main twit kar bataa sakate hai
 Then all the mps can read that tweet to the youth of their respective areas
 railway kii naukariyon par march 2017 ke baad oktober 2017 main ek or blog likhaa
 By then the minister had changed in rail
 suresh prabhu kii jagah piyush goyal aa chuke the
 We have seen what statements Piyush Goyal has made so far on employment on September 30, and how it has been published
 kai baar hota he ki vahi vaale topic ke kaaran aise bayanon par thik se charchaa nahin ho paati he
 In district editions, such news is smaller than a printed single column
 29 oktober 2017 ko bayaan chhapata he ki railway paanch saal main 150 arab rupee kaa nivesh karegaa or 10 lakh atirikt rojgaar paidaa karegaa
 No one knows concretely what this additional employment is
 jab 2013-2018 ke bich railway ke mainpavar main koi badhotaree nahin he to kis hisaab se 13 lakh mainpavar vaale railway main das lakh log or jud jaaenge
 Was it a deliberate statement or simply said and the headline was printed
 1 oktober 2017 ko rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah doosraa bayaan mila jisamen ve daawa kar rahe hai ki ek saal ke bheetar das lakh rojgaar paidaa ho sakate hai
 The Minister of Railways says the rail ecosystem instead of railways
 yah sidhe-sidhe railway main job nahin hoga magar railway ke iko system ke bheetar ek saal ke bheetar kam se kam 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar sakate hai
 It has been 5 months since Piyush Goyal became the Railway Minister, so has more than 4 lakh jobs been created in the railway ecosystem? If 10 lakh jobs can be created in less than 12 months, then about 4 lakh 20 thousand jobs are created in 5 months or not
 yaa yah bhi hedline bhar ke liye tha
 The headline appeared, good feeling came and then the news disappeared
 yah khabar saare pramukh akhabaaron main chhapi thi
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's statement talking about creating one million jobs is also strange
 7 oktober ke iconomik times or vir main mantri ji kaa bayaan chapa he
 At the World Economic Forum, Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that 200 big companies of India are reducing jobs every year
 agar ye 200 badi companiyaan naukari nahin dengi to puure samaaj ko saath lekar chalanaa kathin se kathin hota jayega
 Then Piyush Goyal said that what Sunil Mittal has said that jobs are getting low is a very good sign
 sachai yah he ki kal kaa yuva naukari khojane vaala nahin hoga, vah naukari dene vaala bananaa chahta he
 The country wants to see more and more youth as entrepreneurs
 naujavaanon ko hi sochna chahie ki kahin unki soch or sarkaar kii soch main antar to nahin aa gaya he
 The government wants to see you as an entrepreneur and you are wasting time seeking jobs from him
 railway main naukariyaan aa nahin rahi hai or noujvaan naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage hai
 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker
 hamase naukari na maangen
 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker
 sikar yani rajasthan vaala sikar nahin, angrezi vaala sikar yani naukari maangane vaala nahin, naukari dene vaala bana rahe hai
 Amit Shah is Sirius this time
 unhone is baar pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko jumala nahin kaha
 When Kishore Ajwani questioned the matter of giving 15 lakhs to everyone in the elections, Amit Shah said that it was a jumla
 pradhanmantri ne jab zee news ke sudhir choudhary se kaha ki pakora tal kar jo 200 rupye kamata he wo bhi to rojgaar he
 Do not know why some people were hoping that Amit Shah would also speak this time that it was a jumla
 magar amit shah ne is baar jumala nahin bolaa
 This means that they are very serious about frying or frying dumplings
 lakhanu ke kuch noujvaan naukari dene nahin, maangane ke liye lakhanu main jamaa hue
 Our colleague Kamal Khan reports that during the Akhilesh government, interviews of 40,000 people had either taken place or were about to take place, but the Yogi government stopped the allegations as soon as they came
 sarkaar ko aae 11 maheene biit gaye hai, lekin na to isaki jaanch hui he na hi inhen naukari mili he
 For three years, politics has created so much debate about the tricolor on the news channels that now even the youth have understood its strength
 inke haathon main tirangaa tha or maang thi ki 9 maheene tak kisi ko adhinsth chayan seva ayog kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya
 The court also rebuked
 itani deree se hamaara jivan barbaad ho rahaa he
 These are performances that never reach the screen of the media, even if they reach, they are put on some edge
 agar ye noujvaan pakora bech rahe hote to aaj inkaa puraa din ek maamuli naukari ke liye pradarshan karne main karaab nahin hota
 By the way, our focus is not on Pakoda, it is on this, so the examinations are being done, for which people are working in the selection commission, a personnel minister is happy, what is the result of them all
 prime time kii naukari series 8 main hamane rajasthan kaa haal bataaya tha
 In Rajasthan, 77,413 conscription courts are stuck
 kai maamalon main court ne niyukti ke aadesh de die hai magar wo bhi puri nahin ho rahi hai
 January of 2013 to 2018 passed
 rajasthan lok seva ayog ne varisht adhyaaapak madhyamik ke liye 13 july 2016 ko vigyaapan nikaala
 It was told that the examination will be taken between 20 and 25 November 2016, but the date of examination was changed four times
 ant main jaakar yah pariksha hoti he july 2017 main
 Written examination takes place one year after the advertisement is taken out

 306 candidates have been declared successful for science
 punjabi bhashaa ke liye 27 ummidavaaron ko safal ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Results of 1269 posts in Hindi, 626 in English and 1531 in Social Sciences are yet to be announced
 har nattejey ke baad kuch na kuch vivaad hota he
 Due to this, examinations also hang, but this problem is also with UPSC
 to phir upiessi kii koi pariksha teen saal ke liye atakati he, kabhi aapane suna he
 We had told in series eight of prime time that the recruitment of 77,413 posts in Rajasthan are stuck in the court
 61,800 bhartiyon congress shashan ke samay kii hai, 15,613 bhartiyon bhaajapa shashan ke samay kii hai
 There were 33,000 recruitments for school assistants since 2013, with no appointment yet
 is maamle main ham intazaar kar rahe hai ki sarkaar jaldi kuch karegi
 The results of two subjects of senior teacher secondary education, the contestants feel that our series is showing some speed
 tippaniyan It is very encouraging that a large number of youth have sent me an affidavit that they will not commit Hindu Muslims, neither will see any TV debates on this topic
 ummid he ve shapath par kaayam rahenge
 Sometimes a debate is necessary, but it is shameful for our society to search and debate it
 ab ham kuch naam lenge taaki chaatro ko bharosa ho jaae ki unki shikaayatein pahunch gai hai
 Many departments of SSC are still not getting the assurance of appointment
 textile mantralay ke afasar zaraa hendicraft vibhaag ke liye chune gaye naujavaanon ko jaldi chitthee bhej den
 It is being learned from many places that there are round things in the letter so that the matter is postponed
 agar maamla talegaa to ham naukari series april tak karenge
 We are not going to postpone
 naukariyon par hamaari 12veen series ho gai he
 So many mails have come, now we will have to restore the postal officer
 kai log tabadale ko lekar bhi likh rahe hai yaa naukariyon ke vivaad ko, pleez aisa na karen
 We will try to come to everyone, let's see
 dilli ke mukherjee nagar main vibhinn parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye yahaan kunjee waalon, kitabon kii duniya, akhbaar or news channelon kii duniya se alag he
 There are many books related to the examination of Railways, the forms are being sold
 yahaan aaenge to hazaron kii sankhya main noujvaan sarkari naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage milenge
 The concentration of preparation is seen on his face
 koching chalaane vaale bhi kah rahe hai ki railway kii jo bhartee nikali he usamen adhiktam umr seemaa 30 varsh honi chahie thi, use ghataakar 28 saal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 This has left thousands of students who have been preparing for many years
 railway kii naukari ke liye desh main kitne lakh noujvaan taiyaari karte hai, ham or aap nahin jaan sakate hai
 If the TV space was not filled with nonsense spokespersons, today you would have seen this face of India on TV
 hamane bihar chunaav ke dauraan aara shahar main dekha tha ki noujvaan kaise ped ke neeche baithkar railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai
 These youngsters cannot afford coaching, so they gather and prepare under the tree
 maine apane jivan main aisa drishy nahin dekha tha
 In a college building in Ara, young men were preparing to bow down
 hamen dilli main baithkar pataa bhi nahin chalata he ki naukariyon ke liye bharat kaa noujvaan kis maansik, aarthik or manouvaigyanik halaat kaa saamana karata he
 Students say that restoration has come after so many years
 ham sab is bhartee kii aas main kai maheenon se taiyaari kar rahe hai or ab umr ke kaaran imtahaan se pehle hi baahar ho gaye
 Our preparation went in vain
 ye tasviir bataati he ki noujvaan naukari kii aas main dadhichi rishi kii tarah haddi galaa rahe hai
 Along with this, their parents are also losing their earnings
 aap jab in naujavaanon ke nazadik jaaenge to pataa chalegaa ki is vakt wo kya sunanaa chaahate hai
 On 2 March 2017 i wrote a blog

 1 oktober 2017 ko rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah doosraa bayaan mila jisamen ve daawa kar rahe hai ki ek saal ke bheetar das lakh rojgaar paidaa ho sakate hai
 The Minister of Railways says the rail ecosystem instead of railways
 yah sidhe-sidhe railway main job nahin hoga magar railway ke iko system ke bheetar ek saal ke bheetar kam se kam 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar sakate hai
 It has been 5 months since Piyush Goyal became the Railway Minister, so has more than 4 lakh jobs been created in the railway ecosystem? If 10 lakh jobs can be created in less than 12 months, then about 4 lakh 20 thousand jobs are created in 5 months or not
 yaa yah bhi hedline bhar ke liye tha
 The headline appeared, good feeling came and then the news disappeared
 yah khabar saare pramukh akhabaaron main chhapi thi
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's statement talking about creating one million jobs is also strange
 7 oktober ke iconomik times or vir main mantri ji kaa bayaan chapa he
 At the World Economic Forum, Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that 200 big companies of India are reducing jobs every year
 agar ye 200 badi companiyaan naukari nahin dengi to puure samaaj ko saath lekar chalanaa kathin se kathin hota jayega
 Then Piyush Goyal said that what Sunil Mittal has said that jobs are getting low is a very good sign
 sachai yah he ki kal kaa yuva naukari khojane vaala nahin hoga, vah naukari dene vaala bananaa chahta he
 The country wants to see more and more youth as entrepreneurs
 naujavaanon ko hi sochna chahie ki kahin unki soch or sarkaar kii soch main antar to nahin aa gaya he
 The government wants to see you as an entrepreneur and you are wasting time seeking jobs from him
 railway main naukariyaan aa nahin rahi hai or noujvaan naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage hai
 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker
 hamase naukari na maangen
 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker
 sikar yani rajasthan vaala sikar nahin, angrezi vaala sikar yani naukari maangane vaala nahin, naukari dene vaala bana rahe hai
 Amit Shah is Sirius this time
 unhone is baar pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko jumala nahin kaha
 When Kishore Ajwani questioned the matter of giving 15 lakhs to everyone in the elections, Amit Shah said that it was a jumla
 pradhanmantri ne jab zee news ke sudhir choudhary se kaha ki pakora tal kar jo 200 rupye kamata he wo bhi to rojgaar he
 Do not know why some people were hoping that Amit Shah would also speak this time that it was a jumla
 magar amit shah ne is baar jumala nahin bolaa
 This means that they are very serious about frying or frying dumplings
 lakhanu ke kuch noujvaan naukari dene nahin, maangane ke liye lakhanu main jamaa hue
 Our colleague Kamal Khan reports that during the Akhilesh government, interviews of 40,000 people had either taken place or were about to take place, but the Yogi government stopped the allegations as soon as they came
 sarkaar ko aae 11 maheene biit gaye hai, lekin na to isaki jaanch hui he na hi inhen naukari mili he
 For three years, politics has created so much debate about the tricolor on the news channels that now even the youth have understood its strength
 inke haathon main tirangaa tha or maang thi ki 9 maheene tak kisi ko adhinsth chayan seva ayog kaa adhyaksh nahin banaaya
 The court also rebuked
 itani deree se hamaara jivan barbaad ho rahaa he
 These are performances that never reach the screen of the media, even if they reach, they are put on some edge
 agar ye noujvaan pakora bech rahe hote to aaj inkaa puraa din ek maamuli naukari ke liye pradarshan karne main karaab nahin hota
 By the way, our focus is not on Pakoda, it is on this, so the examinations are being done, for which people are working in the selection commission, a personnel minister is happy, what is the result of them all
 prime time kii naukari series 8 main hamane rajasthan kaa haal bataaya tha
 In Rajasthan, 77,413 conscription courts are stuck

 January of 2013 to 2018 passed
 rajasthan lok seva ayog ne varisht adhyaaapak madhyamik ke liye 13 july 2016 ko vigyaapan nikaala
 It was told that the examination will be taken between 20 and 25 November 2016, but the date of examination was changed four times

 306 candidates have been declared successful for science

 Results of 1269 posts in Hindi, 626 in English and 1531 in Social Sciences are yet to be announced
 har nattejey ke baad kuch na kuch vivaad hota he
 Due to this, examinations also hang, but this problem is also with UPSC
 to phir upiessi kii koi pariksha teen saal ke liye atakati he, kabhi aapane suna he
 We had told in series eight of prime time that the recruitment of 77,413 posts in Rajasthan are stuck in the court
 61,800 bhartiyon congress shashan ke samay kii hai, 15,613 bhartiyon bhaajapa shashan ke samay kii hai
 There were 33,000 recruitments for school assistants since 2013, with no appointment yet

 The results of two subjects of senior teacher secondary education, the contestants feel that our series is showing some speed
 tippaniyan It is very encouraging that a large number of youth have sent me an affidavit that they will not commit Hindu Muslims, neither will see any TV debates on this topic
 ummid he ve shapath par kaayam rahenge
 Sometimes a debate is necessary, but it is shameful for our society to search and debate it
 ab ham kuch naam lenge taaki chaatro ko bharosa ho jaae ki unki shikaayatein pahunch gai hai
 Many departments of SSC are still not getting the assurance of appointment
 textile mantralay ke afasar zaraa hendicraft vibhaag ke liye chune gaye naujavaanon ko jaldi chitthee bhej den
 It is being learned from many places that there are round things in the letter so that the matter is postponed
 agar maamla talegaa to ham naukari series april tak karenge
 We are not going to postpone
 naukariyon par hamaari 12veen series ho gai he
 So many mails have come, now we will have to restore the postal officer
 kai log tabadale ko lekar bhi likh rahe hai yaa naukariyon ke vivaad ko, pleez aisa na karen
 We will try to come to everyone, let's see
 ye noujvaan koching kaa karcha nahin uthaa sakate isliye ped ke neeche jamaa hokar taiyaari karte hai
 i had never seen such a scene in my life
 aara ke ek college kii imaarat main noujvaan sar jhukaae taiyaari kar rahe the
 We do not even know from sitting in Delhi what mental, economic and psychological conditions the young Indian of India faces for jobs
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki itane saal baad bahaali ai he
 We all have been preparing for this recruitment for many months and now due to age, have already passed out of examination
 hamaari taiyaari bekaar ho gai
 This picture shows that Dadhichi is strangling the bones like a sage in the hope of employment
 inke saath inke maa baap bhi apni kamai galaa rahe hai
 When you get close to these young people, you will know what they want to hear right now
 2 march 2017 ko maine ek blog likhaa tha
 The basis of the blog was Pradeep Thakur's report published in the Times of India
 khabar thi ki railway main do lakh naukariyaan kam kar di gai hai
 If two lakh jobs will be less, then what will be spent on these youth, have they been told not to prepare themselves, because the government is going to reduce jobs
 meri raay main inhen bataa dena chahie
 On 2 March 2017 i wrote a blog on the restoration of railways
 tab bahut se log meraa blog padhane se pehle hi naaraaz ho jate the magar ab teen chaar saal baad apane likhe kaa bhi moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he ki jo likhaa wo samay ke anusaar tha yaa nahin, kitna sahi tha kitna galat tha
 The basis of this blog was Pradeep Thakur's report printed secretly on the last pages of that daily Times of India
 pradeep ne apni report main likhaa tha ki 2015 se 2018 tak railway ke mainpavar main koi badlaav nahin hoga
 Did that really happen? For this, we have considered only the data given in the budget paper
 aap bhi chahen to bajet kaa link chatka kar yah aankada check kar sakate hai
 Part 4 of the expenditure profile has to go to the first section of Establishment and Public Enterprises
 hamane 2014 ke bajet se check kiya he
 The number of jobs in the railway is decreasing by only 13
 2014 se lekar 2018 tak vahi barkaraar he
 There is no change in the number of railway manpower
 2014-15 ke bajet main 1 march 2013 tak mainpavar tha- 13,07,109 In the 2015-16 budget, as of 1 March 2014, manpower was - 13,33,966 2016-17 ke bajet main 1 march 2015 tak mainpavar tha- 13,08,472 The manpower in the 2017-18 budget as of 1 March 2016 was - 13,08,472 2018-19 ke bajet main 1 march 2017 tak mainpavar tha- 13,08,472 There is no increase in railway manpower for three years
 naukariyon main kami upie ke samay se hi hone lagi thi
 On 1 January 2014, the sanctioned strength was 15 lakh 57 thousand
 tab bhi 13 lakh saat hazaar log hi kaam kar rahe the
 In this way, in the last few years you can say that there have been two lakh jobs in the Railways
 aankadon kii baat he isliye bhulchook leni deni kii gunzaaish rahani chahie
 mps can go to the students preparing for railway jobs and can tell you not to prepare
 railway main do lakh naukariyaan kam kar di gayi hai
 As it is a time of transparency, no youth of India will speak in the national interest after hearing from the mouth of the MP that two lakh jobs have been reduced
 tali bajaaega
 On December 12, 2014, when Suresh Prabhu was the Railway Minister, he gave a statement in the Rajya Sabha that 1 lakh 2 thousand posts related to safety have been left in the Railways
 mujhe nahin lagata ki tab se lekar ab tak 1 lakh vekainsee ai he
 If the Railway Minister wishes, he can tweet in ten minutes
 phir us twit ko sabhi saansad apane apane kshetra ke naujavaanon ko padhaa sakate hai
 Wrote another blog on railway jobs in March 2017 followed by October 2017
 tab tak rail main mantri badal gaye the
 Piyush Goyal had come in place of Suresh Prabhu
 hamane dekha ki 30 sitambar ko rail mantri banane ke baad piyush goyal ne rojgaar ko lekar abhi tak kya kya bayaan die hai or use kaise chapa gaya he
 Many times, such statements are not discussed properly due to the same topic
 zila sanskarnon main aisi khabaren chhapate chhapate single kollam se bhi choti ho jaati hai
 On 29 October 2017, the statement printed that Railways will invest 150 billion rupees in five years and create 1 million additional jobs
 yah atirikt rojgaar kya he, kisi ko thos rup se nahin pataa
 When there is no increase in the manpower of the railway between 2013-2018, then according to which way one million people will be added to the railway with 13 lakh manpower
 kya yah soch samaj kar diya gaya bayaan tha yaa yun hi kah diya gaya or hedline chap gai
 On 1 October 2017, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal got this second statement claiming that one million jobs can be created within a year
 rail mantri railway kii jagah rail echosystem kehete hai
 It will not be a direct job in the railways, but within the railway's eco system, it can generate at least 10 lakh jobs within a year
 piyush goyal ko rail mantri bane hue 5 maheene ho gaye hai, to kya railway ke echosystem main 4 lakh se adhik rojgaar paidaa hua he? agar 12 maheene se kam main 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa ho saktaa he to 5 maheene main kareeb chaar lakh 20 hazaar rojgaar paidaa huya yaa nahin
 Or was it to fill the headline too
 hedline chhapi, good feeling ai or uske baad khabar gaayab
 This news was published in all the leading newspapers
 das lakh rojgaar paidaa karne kii baat karte karte rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah bayaan bhi ajeeb he
 The Minister's statement has been published in the Economic Times and Wire of October 7
 vishwa aarthik forum main airtel ke sunil mittal ne kaha tha ki bharat kii 200 badi companiyaan har saal naukariyaan kam kar rahi hai
 If these 200 big companies will not give jobs, then it will become difficult to carry the whole society together
 tab is par piyush goyal ne kaha ki jo sunil mittal ne kaha he ki naukariyaan kam ho rahi hai vah ek bahut acha sanket he
 The truth is that tomorrow's youth will not be job seekers, they want to be job seekers
 desh zyaada se zyaada yuvaaon ko udhyami ke rup main dekhnaa chahta he
 Young people should think that there is a difference between their thinking and the thinking of the government
 sarkaar aapako udhyami ke rup main dekhnaa chaahati he or aap hai ki usase naukari maangane main time karaab kar rahe hai
 Jobs are not coming in the railway and the youth are preparing for jobs
 sarkaar ko bhi in naujavaanon ko email bhej dena chahie ki ham chaahate hai ki aap naukari dene vaala bane, naukari maangane vaala nahin
 Do not ask for a job from us
 vaise sarkaar apni yah baat har morche par kah rahi he ki ham yuvaaon ko job sikar nahin, giver bananaa chaahate hai
 Sikar means Rajasthan, not Sikar, English is a Sikar, not a person seeking a job, but a job-seller
 amit shah is baar sirius hai
 He did not call the Prime Minister's statement this time as a jumla
 chunaavon main jab har kisi ko 15 lakh dene kii baat par kishor ajavani ne sawaal kiya to amit shah ne kaha ki wo jumala tha
 When the Prime Minister told Sudhir Chaudhary of Zee News that the one who earns 200 rupees by frying pakodas is also employed
 pataa nahin kuch log kyon ummid kar rahe the ki amit shah is baar bhi bol denge ki wo jumala tha
 But Amit Shah did not speak this time
 iskaa matlab he ki pakora talane yaa talawaane ko lekar ve kaaphi gambhir hai
 Some youth of Lucknow gathered in Lucknow to ask for not giving jobs
 hamaare sahyogi kamaal khan kii report he ki akhilesh sarkaar ke dauraan 40,000 logon ke intervyuu yaa to ho gaye the yaa hone vaale the lekin yogi sarkaar ne aate hi gadabadi kaa aarope lagaakar roak laga di
 11 months have passed for the government, but neither it has been investigated nor they have got a job
 raajnneeti ne teen saal tak news channelon par tirange ko lekar itani bahes karai ki ab noujvaan bhi samaj gaye hai isaki takat
 He had a tricolor in his hands and demanded that no one be made the chairman of the Subordinate Selection Service Commission for 9 months
 court kii fatkaar bhi lagi
 Our lives are being ruined for so long
 ye wo pradarshan hai jo kabhi media kii screen par nahin pahunch pate, pahunchate bhi hai to kisi kinare laga die jate hai
 If these young men were selling pakodas, then today their whole day would not be bad for performing for a modest job
 vaise hamaara focus pakora par nahin he, is par he to parikshaayen ho rahi hai, jiske liye chayan ayog main log naukari kar rahe hai, ek carmik mantri mouj karata he, un sabakaa kya nateeja he
 In the prime time job series 8, we told the condition of Rajasthan
 rajasthan main 77,413 bharatiyaan court ke kaaran ataki padi hai
 In many cases, the court has ordered the appointment, but they are also not being fulfilled
 2013 se 2018 kaa janvari biit gaya
 Rajasthan Public Service Commission released advertisement for Senior Teacher Secondary on 13 July 2016
 bataaya gaya ki 20 se 25 november 2016 ke bich pariksha lee jaaegi lekin chaar-chaar baar pariksha kii taarikh badali gai
 Finally this exam is done in July 2017
 vigyaapan nikaalane ke ek saal baad likhit pariksha hoti he
 After six months, results come but that too of two subjects
 vigyaan ke liye 306 ummidavaaron ko safal ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 27 candidates for the Punjabi language have been declared successful
 hindi ke 1269, angrezi ke 626, saamaajik vigyaan ke 1531 padon ke nattejey aane baaki hai
 There is some dispute after every result
 is kaaran bhi parikshaayen latakati hai magar ye dikkat to upiessi ke saath bhi he
 Then any UPSC exam is stuck for three years, sometimes you have heard
 hamane prime time ke series aath main bataaya tha ki rajasthan main 77,413 padon kii bhartiyon court main ataki padi hai
 61,800 recruitments are during Congress rule, 15,613 recruitments are during BJP rule
 2013 se vidhyalay sahaayak ke liye 33,000 bhartiyon nikali thim, abhi tak niyukti nahin hui he
 In this case, we are waiting for the government to do something quickly
 varisht adhyaaapak madhyamik shiksha ke do vishyon kaa jo rigelt aayaa he, pratiyogiyon ko lagata he ki hamaari series ke kaaran kuch tezi aati dikh rahi he
 The comments yah behad utsahjanak baat he ki badi sankhya main naujavaanon ne mujhe shapath patr bheja he ki ve hindu muslim nahin karenge, na to is topic par koi tivi dibet dekhenge
 Hopefully, they will uphold the oath
 kabhi kabhi koi bahes zaruri ho jaati he magar aae din khoj khojkar is par dibet karnaa hamaare samaaj ke liye sharmnaak he
 Now we will take some names so that the students are confident that their complaints have reached
 esayssi ke kai vibhaagon se bhi abhi niyukti kaa bharosa nahin mil rahaa he
 Officers of the Ministry of Textiles should send a letter to the youth selected for the Department of Handicrafts
 kai jagah se pataa chalaa rahaa he ki chitthee main gol mol baaten hai taaki maamla tal jaae
 If the matter is deferred, we will do the job series till April
 ham nahin talane vaale hai
 We have our 12th series on Jobs
 itane mail aa gaye hai ab hamen bhi postal afisar behaal karne pade jaaenge
 Many people are writing about the transfer or the dispute of jobs, please do not do this
 ham koshish karenge ki sabhi kii baat aa jaae, dekhte hai

 The loss of jobs was started from the time of UPA

 Even then only 13 lakh seven thousand people were working
 is tarah pichley kuch saalon main aap kah sakate hai ki railway main do lakh naukariyaan kam hui hai
 It is a matter of statistics, so there should be a scope for making mistakes
 railway kii naukariyon kii taiyaari kar rahe chaatro ko saansad hi jaakar bataa sakate hai ki aap taiyaari na karen
 Two lakh jobs have been reduced in Railways

 We have seen what statements Piyush Goyal has made so far on employment on September 30, and how it has been published
 kai baar hota he ki vahi vaale topic ke kaaran aise bayanon par thik se charchaa nahin ho paati he
 In district editions, such news is smaller than a printed single column
 29 oktober 2017 ko bayaan chhapata he ki railway paanch saal main 150 arab rupee kaa nivesh karegaa or 10 lakh atirikt rojgaar paidaa karegaa
 No one knows concretely what this additional employment is
 jab 2013-2018 ke bich railway ke mainpavar main koi badhotaree nahin he to kis hisaab se 13 lakh mainpavar vaale railway main das lakh log or jud jaaenge
 Was it a deliberate statement or simply said and the headline was printed
 1 oktober 2017 ko rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah doosraa bayaan mila jisamen ve daawa kar rahe hai ki ek saal ke bheetar das lakh rojgaar paidaa ho sakate hai
 The Minister of Railways says the rail ecosystem instead of railways
 yah sidhe-sidhe railway main job nahin hoga magar railway ke iko system ke bheetar ek saal ke bheetar kam se kam 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar sakate hai
 It has been 5 months since Piyush Goyal became the Railway Minister, so has more than 4 lakh jobs been created in the railway ecosystem? If 10 lakh jobs can be created in less than 12 months, then about 4 lakh 20 thousand jobs are created in 5 months or not

 The headline appeared, good feeling came and then the news disappeared

 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's statement talking about creating one million jobs is also strange

 Then Piyush Goyal said that what Sunil Mittal has said that jobs are getting low is a very good sign
 sachai yah he ki kal kaa yuva naukari khojane vaala nahin hoga, vah naukari dene vaala bananaa chahta he
 The country wants to see more and more youth as entrepreneurs

 The government wants to see you as an entrepreneur and you are wasting time seeking jobs from him
 railway main naukariyaan aa nahin rahi hai or noujvaan naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage hai
 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker
 hamase naukari na maangen
 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker
 sikar yani rajasthan vaala sikar nahin, angrezi vaala sikar yani naukari maangane vaala nahin, naukari dene vaala bana rahe hai

 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker

 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker
 sikar yani rajasthan vaala sikar nahin, angrezi vaala sikar yani naukari maangane vaala nahin, naukari dene vaala bana rahe hai

 pradhanmantri ne jab zee news ke sudhir choudhary se kaha ki pakora tal kar jo 200 rupye kamata he wo bhi to rojgaar he
 Do not know why some people were hoping that Amit Shah would also speak this time that it was a jumla

 This means that they are very serious about frying or frying dumplings

 So many mails have come, now we will have to restore the postal officer
 kai log tabadale ko lekar bhi likh rahe hai yaa naukariyon ke vivaad ko, pleez aisa na karen
 We will try to come to everyone, let's see
 1 oktober 2017 ko rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah doosraa bayaan mila jisamen ve daawa kar rahe hai ki ek saal ke bheetar das lakh rojgaar paidaa ho sakate hai
 The Minister of Railways says the rail ecosystem instead of railways
 yah sidhe-sidhe railway main job nahin hoga magar railway ke iko system ke bheetar ek saal ke bheetar kam se kam 10 lakh rojgaar paidaa kar sakate hai
 It has been 5 months since Piyush Goyal became the Railway Minister, so has more than 4 lakh jobs been created in the railway ecosystem? If 10 lakh jobs can be created in less than 12 months, then about 4 lakh 20 thousand jobs are created in 5 months or not
 yaa yah bhi hedline bhar ke liye tha
 The headline appeared, good feeling came and then the news disappeared
 yah khabar saare pramukh akhabaaron main chhapi thi
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal's statement talking about creating one million jobs is also strange
 7 oktober ke iconomik times or vir main mantri ji kaa bayaan chapa he
 At the World Economic Forum, Airtel's Sunil Mittal had said that 200 big companies of India are reducing jobs every year
 agar ye 200 badi companiyaan naukari nahin dengi to puure samaaj ko saath lekar chalanaa kathin se kathin hota jayega
 Then Piyush Goyal said that what Sunil Mittal has said that jobs are getting low is a very good sign
 sachai yah he ki kal kaa yuva naukari khojane vaala nahin hoga, vah naukari dene vaala bananaa chahta he
 The country wants to see more and more youth as entrepreneurs
 naujavaanon ko hi sochna chahie ki kahin unki soch or sarkaar kii soch main antar to nahin aa gaya he
 The government wants to see you as an entrepreneur and you are wasting time seeking jobs from him
jobs are not coming in the railway main naukariyaan aa nahin rahi hai or noujvaan naukariyon kii taiyaari main lage hai
 The government should also send an email to these youth that we want you to be a job-giver, not a job-seeker
 hamase naukari na maangen
 By the way, the government is saying this on every front that we want to make the youth a giver, not a job seeker

 We will try to come to everyone, let's see
 das lakh rojgaar paidaa karne kii baat karte karte rail mantri piyush goyal kaa yah bayaan bhi ajeeb he
 The Minister's statement has been published in the Economic Times and Wire of October 7
 vishwa aarthik forum main airtel ke sunil mittal ne kaha tha ki bharat kii 200 badi companiyaan har saal naukariyaan kam kar rahi hai
 If these 200 big companies will not give jobs, then it will become difficult to carry the whole society together
 tab is par piyush goyal ne kaha ki jo sunil mittal ne kaha he ki naukariyaan kam ho rahi hai vah ek bahut acha sanket he
 The truth is that tomorrow's youth will not be job seekers, they want to be job seekers
 desh zyaada se zyaada yuvaaon ko udhyami ke rup main dekhnaa chahta he
 Young people should think that there is a difference between their thinking and the thinking of the government
 sarkaar aapako udhyami ke rup main dekhnaa chaahati he or aap hai ki usase naukari maangane main time karaab kar rahe hai
 Jobs are not coming in the railway and the youth are preparing for jobs
 sarkaar ko bhi in naujavaanon ko email bhej dena chahie ki ham chaahate hai ki aap naukari dene vaala bane, naukari maangane vaala nahin
 Do not ask for a job from us
 vaise sarkaar apni yah baat har morche par kah rahi he ki ham yuvaaon ko job sikar nahin, giver bananaa chaahate hai
 Sikar means Rajasthan, not Sikar, English is a Sikar, not a person seeking a job, but a job-seller
 amit shah is baar sirius hai
 He did not call the Prime Minister's statement this time as a jumla
 chunaavon main jab har kisi ko 15 lakh dene kii baat par kishor ajavani ne sawaal kiya to amit shah ne kaha ki wo jumala tha
 When the Prime Minister told Sudhir Chaudhary of Zee News that the one who earns 200 rupees by frying pakodas is also employed
 pataa nahin kuch log kyon ummid kar rahe the ki amit shah is baar bhi bol denge ki wo jumala tha
 But Amit Shah did not speak this time
 iskaa matlab he ki pakora talane yaa talawaane ko lekar ve kaaphi gambhir hai
 Some youth of Lucknow gathered in Lucknow to ask for not giving jobs
 hamaare sahyogi kamaal khan kii report he ki akhilesh sarkaar ke dauraan 40,000 logon ke intervyuu yaa to ho gaye the yaa hone vaale the lekin yogi sarkaar ne aate hi gadabadi kaa aarope lagaakar roak laga di
 11 months have passed for the government, but neither it has been investigated nor they have got a job
 raajnneeti ne teen saal tak news channelon par tirange ko lekar itani bahes karai ki ab noujvaan bhi samaj gaye hai isaki takat
 He had a tricolor in his hands and demanded that no one be made the chairman of the Subordinate Selection Service Commission for 9 months
 court kii fatkaar bhi lagi
 Our lives are being ruined for so long
 ye wo pradarshan hai jo kabhi media kii screen par nahin pahunch pate, pahunchate bhi hai to kisi kinare laga die jate hai
 If these young men were selling pakodas, then today their whole day would not be bad for performing for a modest job
 vaise hamaara focus pakora par nahin he, is par he to parikshaayen ho rahi hai, jiske liye chayan ayog main log naukari kar rahe hai, ek carmik mantri mouj karata he, un sabakaa kya nateeja he
 In the prime time job series 8, we told the condition of Rajasthan
 rajasthan main 77,413 bharatiyaan court ke kaaran ataki padi hai
 In many cases, the court has ordered the appointment, but they are also not being fulfilled
 2013 se 2018 kaa janvari biit gaya
 Rajasthan Public Service Commission released advertisement for Senior Teacher Secondary on 13 July 2016
 bataaya gaya ki 20 se 25 november 2016 ke bich pariksha lee jaaegi lekin chaar-chaar baar pariksha kii taarikh badali gai
 Finally this exam is done in July 2017
 vigyaapan nikaalane ke ek saal baad likhit pariksha hoti he
 After six months, results come but that too of two subjects
 vigyaan ke liye 306 ummidavaaron ko safal ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 27 candidates for the Punjabi language have been declared successful
 hindi ke 1269, angrezi ke 626, saamaajik vigyaan ke 1531 padon ke nattejey aane baaki hai
 There is some dispute after every result
 is kaaran bhi parikshaayen latakati hai magar ye dikkat to upiessi ke saath bhi he
 Then any UPSC exam is stuck for three years, sometimes you have heard
 hamane prime time ke series aath main bataaya tha ki rajasthan main 77,413 padon kii bhartiyon court main ataki padi hai
 61,800 recruitments are during Congress rule, 15,613 recruitments are during BJP rule
 2013 se vidhyalay sahaayak ke liye 33,000 bhartiyon nikali thim, abhi tak niyukti nahin hui he
 In this case, we are waiting for the government to do something quickly
 varisht adhyaaapak madhyamik shiksha ke do vishyon kaa jo rigelt aayaa he, pratiyogiyon ko lagata he ki hamaari series ke kaaran kuch tezi aati dikh rahi he
 The comments yah behad utsahjanak baat he ki badi sankhya main naujavaanon ne mujhe shapath patr bheja he ki ve hindu muslim nahin karenge, na to is topic par koi tivi dibet dekhenge
 Hopefully, they will uphold the oath
 kabhi kabhi koi bahes zaruri ho jaati he magar aae din khoj khojkar is par dibet karnaa hamaare samaaj ke liye sharmnaak he
 Now we will take some names so that the students are confident that their complaints have reached
 esayssi ke kai vibhaagon se bhi abhi niyukti kaa bharosa nahin mil rahaa he
 Officers of the Ministry of Textiles should send a letter to the youth selected for the Department of Handicrafts
 kai jagah se pataa chalaa rahaa he ki chitthee main gol mol baaten hai taaki maamla tal jaae
 If the matter is deferred, we will do the job series till April
 ham nahin talane vaale hai
 We have our 12th series on Jobs
 itane mail aa gaye hai ab hamen bhi postal afisar behaal karne pade jaaenge
 Many people are writing about the transfer or the dispute of jobs, please do not do this
