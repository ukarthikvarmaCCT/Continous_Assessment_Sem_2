 pien mishra ne kaha ki hai court ne mana tha ki muslim is babat koi saboot nahin de paae ki babar ne banaaya tha
 There is no evidence that the mosque was built in 1528 and there is no evidence that it was built by Babur
 pien mishra ne kaha ki yah to spasht he ki masjid ko mandir ke upar banaaya gaya tha kyonki mandir ke avshesh us jagah se mili hai
 Some people believe that the temple was demolished and a mosque was built while some believe that the temple was demolished and the mosque was built
 pien mishra ne kaha elahabaad hoicourt ne apane faisle main kaha ki yah sabit nahin ho paaya he ki vivaadit jameen par mandir ko todakar masjid kaa nirmaan babar ne karaayaa tha yaa aurangzeb ne? mishra ne kaha ki babar vivaadit jameen kaa maalik nahin tha
 In such a situation, i say that when there is no evidence, the Muslim party cannot be given possession or share of the disputed land
 mishra ne kaha ki babar ne masjid kaa nirmaan nahin karaayaa tha or na hi vah vivaadit jameen kaa maalik tha
 When Babur was not the owner of the land, the Sunni Waqf Board did not have any claim in the case
 justise bobade ne pien mishra se teen bindu spasht karne ke liye kaha ki vahaan par ek dhaancha tha is bare main koi vivaad nahin he, par kya vah dhaancha masjid he yaa nahin? bahes yah he
 To whom was that structure dedicated? PN Mishra stated that Shah Jahan ruled in 1648 and Aurangzeb was the ruler of Gujarat
 is par muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne aapatti jataai
 Rajiv Dhawan said that till now Mishra has gone out of context and told stories
 justise chandrachud ne kaha ki yah apane tathyon ko rakh rahe hai, lekin unhone mishra se bhi kaha ki sirf sandarbh bataaen
 PN Mishra said that only the court can guide me, not my fellow lawyer
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki aap swatantra hai apane tathy rakhane ko, aap aapkaa paksh rakhen
 Mishra said that there is no evidence that the mosque was built by Babur
 justise bobade ne poocha iskaa matlab he ki babar jameen kaa maalik nahin tha? pien mishra ne kaha ki hoicourt ne bahumat se mana tha ki is baat ke saboot nahin hai ki babar jameen kaa maalik tha
 He said that the High Court had believed that the construction of the mosque was done by destroying the temple
 hai court ne mana tha ki masjid kaa nirmaan mandir ko dhwast kar kiya gaya tha
 Mir Baqi was constructed at Babar's behest
 justise chandrachud ne poocha ki iskaa matlab he ki hoicourt ne bahumat se yah mana tha ki is baat ke saboot nahin ki masjid kaa nirmaan babar ne karaayaa tha? mishra ne kaha ki haa, is baat ke saboot nahin hai ki masjid kaa nirmaan babar ne karaayaa tha
 PN Mishra debated about the mosque building, what are the laws to build a mosque in Islam
 ek masjid usee jagah par banaai ja sakati he jab uskaa maalik masjid banane kii ijaajat de
 The land given to Waqf must be owned by the owner
 mishra ne kaha ki quran main yah nahin bataaya gaya ki is tarah kii zamin par masjid banaai ja sakati he
 Mishra said that according to Islam, a mosque cannot be built at that place by demolishing or demolishing another place of worship
 aisi zamin jis par do logon kaa kabza ho or ek masjid banane kaa virodh kare to us jameen par bhi masjid nahin banaai ja sakati
 He said that it is Capricorn to demolish any other religious place and build a mosque using it
 unhone kaha ki yah satya he ki kisi duusare ke dharm sthal ko jabardastee giraakar us par masjid nahin banaai ja sakati, masjid allaah kii ibaadat ke liye banaai jaati he
 PN Mishra said that the disputed structure was opened only for 2-3 hours for the namaaz
 islamic kanoon ke anusaar agar kahin masjid main ajaan hoti he or do samay kii namaaj nahin hoti he to vah masjid nahin rah jaati he
 Justice Bobde asked whether a king could make waqf from the property of the state or he would have to buy the property first? Mishra, citing Tarkhi Feroz Shahi, said that the victor from the conquered property owns 1 / 10 as remuneration
 or apane paarishramik main se vah ek vakf bana saktaa he
 Mishra said that until 1860 there was no evidence of Muslims offering prayers in the disputed structure in Ayodhya
 justise chandrachud ne poocha ki kya koi raja kisi kii sampatti ko vakf kar saktaa he? mishra ne aitihaasik vaakye kaa hawala dete hue badshaah or mufti ke bich hui baatcheet kaa zikr kiya
 Its essence was that the king could charge Jaziya but could not waqf by snatching someone's land
 mishra ne islam ke itihaas main hazrat mohammad or unke anuyaayiyon ke bich khaybar main kharidi zamin ko lekar hui baatcheet kaa byora diya
 That is, you can build a mausoleum, mosque or religious building only by purchasing land
 jabaran dhamkaakar, chhinakar yaa kabza kar nahin
 Mishra said that no matter how big a king or ruler is, one cannot establish anything other than the rules of Islam
 koi raja kitna bhi shaktishaalee kyon na ho, yah nahin kah saktaa ki ham chaahate hai ki ab se haj hamaari sultanate main hi ho, ye nahin ho saktaa
 The mosque is recognized as a mosque only when there is a Friday Friday congregational prayer and azaan with all five
 do vakt kii namaaz kaa naga ho gaya to masjid kii manyata nahin hoti
 Even in the time of Jaziya tax, Muslim soldiers or people used to offer prayers in temples as Jaziya for three-three days, but this never made a temple mosque
 kyonki jajia ke rup main vah jagah namaaz padhane ke liye lee jaati thi
 Jiziya tax remained in force till 1860
 iske evaj main mughal or muslim mandiron kii imaarat main namaaz padhate rahe the
 The court asked that when there could be prayers in the temple building, could there not be worship in the mosque building? Mishra said that Hindus have been worshiping there since centuries
 muslim to baad main jabaran vahaan namaaz padhane lage
 The hearing of the case will continue on Friday

 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki jab is sammaan samaaroh ko patidaaron ke liye rakhaa gaya he to isamen amit shah or vijay rupani jaise gaiyrpatidaaron kaa sammaan kyon ho rahaa he
 Hardik said that i am being maligned by BJP
 saath hi is andolan ko kamjor karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Atarajhardik objected to the use of the word Patidar when legislators and leaders of other societies are coming to the event
 to isamen kyumpatidarshabda kaa istemaal kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 Not only this, Patel lashed out at the BJP saying that the BJP could not go among the Patidars since the Patidar movement
 isliye wo is tarah ke kaarykram yojit karvaa kar patelon ke bich main aane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Hardik also gave his reaction to the protest by the Patels for this honor ceremony
 hardik ne saaf kiya ki patidaaron kii ore se virodh lagaataar jari rahegaa or is baar virodh kii kya ranneeti he? use bataane kii jarietrat nahin he
 The companions are leaving the Patidar movement
 It is worth mentioning that in the last 15 days, three partners of Hardik Patel's Patidar movement have left together
 patel ne khud ke kamjor padane par bhi safai dete hue kaha ki ye sab bijepi kaa jhootha prachaar he
 If i have become weak then why have i kept under house arrest
 ekbar chhod de phir dekh le ki koun kamjor or koun majboot he
 Hardik Patel had filed a habeas corpus petition against the Rajasthan government in the Jodhpur High Court for keeping him under house arrest in Udaipur

 In the year 2017, the Aadhaar card has become such a document, which was not only the most discussed, but it is also necessary to link it to more than 100 government schemes
 is saal ke khatm hote-hote bhi aadhaar ek ahm mudda bana hua he
 In 2017, Aadhar Card has emerged as the strongest document

 Aadhaar has become mandatory in 2017
 Aadhar card has been made mandatory for many government schemes

 vahiin, is dastavej ne aam aadmi kii raah aasaan karne kaa kaam bhi kiya
 For example, a special benefit is being given to the subscriber by linking Aadhaar to the provident fund
 agar aapkaa pief khaataa aadhaar se link ho to aap aasaani se online apana pief viddraow kar sakate hai
 In addition to bookpf for 12 train tickets in a month, the option to link IRCTC account with Aadhaar was also introduced in 2017
 iarsitisi acount se bhale hi aadhaar ko link karnaa anivaary nahin kiya gaya he, lekin aisa karne se aapako phayda jarur diya ja rahaa he
 In October itself, Indian Railways said that any person who links his Aadhaar to IRCTC can book 12 tickets in a month
 jabaki jinka aadhaar link nahin he, ve sirf 6 tikat hi ek maheene main book kar paaenge
 Also read: Whenever Aadhaar is being used wrongly, then take this discussion from the Kadamgali-gali to the Supreme Court on the basis of which the year of 2017 has increased, the importance of Aadhaar has also increased rapidly
 ek taraf jahaan ise kai sarkari yojanaon ke liye anivaary kiya gaya

 in par sunwaayee karte hue hi sarvocch nyaayalay ne bank khaataa or mobile number samet anya yojanaon ko aadhaar se link karne ke liye march tak samay diya
 Apart from the Supreme Court, the Aadhaar card remained an important issue of debate among the common man
 kal tak voter idi or driving license ko pahchaan patr ke taur par dene vaale log ab sirf aadhaar card ko pahchaan patr ke taur par istemaal karne lage
 Not only this, in many places, Aadhaar is being given priority while seeking identity cards from common people

 The Delhi government, including some 'petty explanations', again sent the file of apology petition of Afzal Guru, convicted for terrorist attack on Parliament, to the Lieutenant Governor on Wednesday
 uparajyapal tejindar khanna ne dilli sarkaar kii tippanee par atirikt spashtikaran ke liye mangalvaar ko yah file lautaa di thi
 The Delhi government had advocated for the death sentence of the Guru, but also said that the aspect of law and order impact should be studied in depth while executing the death sentence
 dilli sarkaar ke ek sheersh sutara ne bataaya, ‘hamane kuch chote-mote spashtikaran dete hue file waapas bhej di he
 He (lt
 Governor) wanted some clarification from our side and we have included them '
 unhone kaha, ‘samvidhan ke anuchhed 72 ke tahat kshamayachika par rajya sarkaar ke vichaar badhyakaari nahin hai or dilli main hamaare paas kanoon-vyavastha kii shaktiyaan bhi nahin hai’
 The source said that meanwhile, the Delhi government had already told the Union Home Ministry in a separate message that the file was 'actively under consideration'
 yah baat usne is mudde par kendra ke solahaven reminder par kahi thi
 The Lt
 Governor's office on Tuesday returned the file saying that the Delhi government's comment on the issue was not very clear and sought clarification on it
 baharhaal, up rajyapal karyaalay or dilli sarkaar donon ne spashtikaran kii prakruti ke bare main kuch kehane se inkaar kiya ki yah bahut hi samvedansheel mudda he
 The Delhi government recently sent this file to the Lieutenant Governor's office on Monday after the sixteenth reminder from the Union Home Ministry
 adhikariyon ke anusaar dilli sarkaar ne apana vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha tha ki guru kii sajaae maut par amal kiye jane par use koi dikkat nahin he, lekin isapar amal karte hue kanoon-vyavastha par iske prabhaavon kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 Opposition parties have criticized the Delhi government for allegedly citing the matter for about four years
 mumbai hamalon ke silsile main pakistani aatankwaadi ajmal aamir kasaab ko sajaae maut sunaae jane ke baad guru kii sajaae maut kaa yah mudda ek baar phir sukhiryon main aayaa

 The Delhi High Court on 29 October confirmed Guru's death sentence
 uske do saal baad chaar agast 2005 ko ucchtam nyaayalay ne guru kii apil khaarij kar di thi
 After this, the Guru filed an apology with the President

 Anupam Kher did not stop here, he took off his tie and coat and put it on the floor in the middle of the stage and folded both arms of his shirt like Rahul
 rahul par vyangy kasate hue or chutki lete hue anupam kher ne ye bhi kah daalaa ki ab bahen modane kaa koi simbolic matlab nahin he
 Anupam Kher gave an interesting 34-minute speech, but did not give anyone a chance to get up from his seat
 bhaashan bhi dete or chutki bhi lete
 He also went among the audience to break the monotony of the speech
 darshakon ke bich baithi ek mahila ko neend aate dekh, anupam kher us mahila ko pani se bhari bottle de aae
 In a speech to Pramod Mahajan, Kher praised Pramod Mahajan's qualities and said that Pramod Mahajan had a very good human test
 kiske saath kitna vakt gujaarna he, kise kya chahie, kise kya takalif he, ve jaldi pahchaan jate the
 This was one of his great specialties

 isiilie chota bhai hone ke naate unka ferj he ki vah bade bhai kii raksha karte rahen
 Anupam Kher, on the charge of imposing nationalism instead of standing 52 seconds of respect for the national anthem, said that when asked to stand in a queue to eat food in a hotel, stand silently for 10-15 minutes without saying anything
 People go, when they have to stand in the line of a cinema ticket, they stand for fifteen to twenty minutes, but to show respect for the country, standing 52 seconds seems to impose patriotism on them

 Additional Sessions Judge Pawan Kumar Jain held Turkman Gate resident Hussain Bano and his elder son Naseem guilty of torturing and burning alive Gulnaaz, wife of younger son Naseeruddin, for dowry based on the victim's pre-death statement
 adaalat ne kaha ki gulnaj dwaara die gaye mrityu purv bayaan main usne apni maut ke kaarnon kaa khulaasa kiya he
 While convicting the accused based on the pre-death statement, the court rejected the argument of the defense counsel that even the prosecution witnesses could not confirm the final statement of the victim
 abhiyojan paksh kaa gavaah gulnaj kaa pati tha jo baad main apni gavaahi se mukar gaya tha
 The judge said, "I sentence both the convicts Hussain Bano and Nasim to life imprisonment for rigorous imprisonment
" ’ iske saath hi donon par baarah-baarah hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya he
 On October 22, a day before the incident in 2008, Hussain and Naseem had beaten Gulnaaz for not bringing dowry
 police kaa kahana he ki agle din jab gulnaj so kar uthi to hossain uske saath jhagada karne lagi, isi dauraan naseem ne us par mitti kaa tel daal kar aag laga di
 Hearing the scream of Gulnaz, her husband Naseeruddin and nephew Shoaib reached there

 They went to attend someone's wedding
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki donon ne gulnaj se kabhi dahej kii maang nahin kii thi or use pratadit nahin kiya tha
 The court rejected both the arguments as they did not have sufficient evidence to prove it

 On Thursday, last week, a picture of Bihar Education Minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma went viral in which it was seen that he is sitting in a room with a glass of wine on the table in front of him
 is tasviir main unke saath kuch anya log bhi dikh rahe hai or teble par dry fruits, angoor or seb rakhe hue hai
 With this picture going viral, opponents raised questions on Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma, and at the same time there was a discussion about the minister drinking alcohol despite the ban on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Kebihar
 haalanki, yah tasviir kab kii thi or kahaan khinchi gai? is baat ko lekar guuruuvaar ko zyada kuch to spasht nahin hua tha magar shiksha mantri se lagaataar sawaal puche ja rahe the
 But, Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma has come out about the truth of this picture and he has told that this picture belongs to him and has been taken on 16 February
 verma ne bataaya ki isi din vah aurangabad gaye the jahaan par unhen purv mukhyamantri karpuri thakur jayanti main shaamil hona tha
 During the visit to Aurangabad, he was invited to his house by local leader Sanjay Singh Kushwaha and there he was watered in a glass of colored Sesharab
 mantri ne spasht kiya he ki tasviir main teble par rakhaa gilaas bhale hi sharaab kii tarah dikh rahaa ho, lekin vah sharaab nahin he, balki sharaab ke rang kaa gilaas he, jisamen pani he
 Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said that behind making this picture viral there is a conspiracy to defame him and the Bihar government

 In the Bihar by-election results, the Rashtriya Janata Dal has gained a big lead in the Araria Lok Sabha seat and its victory is almost certain to be decided
 argedy kii ye jeet kai myanon main khaas he, kyonki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main narendra modi kii aguwai main bijepi ne bihar main badi jeet hasil kii thi or maujuuda samay main nitish ke saath aa jane se mana ja rahaa tha ki bijepi or jadyu kaa gathbandhan argedy par baari pad saktaa he, lekin aisa nahin hua or argedy apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Not only this, the RJD has also challenged the BJP-JDU alliance in the Jehanabad and Bhabua Assembly by-elections
 bijepi bhabhua vidhansabha seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 However, in Jehanabad, the BJP-JDU coalition has suffered a crushing defeat
 lalu ko jail, argedy ko mili sahanubhuthabihar upachunaav main bijepi-jadyu gathbandhan kii haar se yah spasht ho gaya he ki nitish se alag hone ke baavjood lalu yadav kamjor nahin sabit honge
 RJD Chief's jail term has proved to be a plus point for RJD in the by-election
 janata ne lalu ke prati samarthan jataate hue arriya or jahanabad main janamat argedy ke paksh main diya he
 The victory of Araria and Jehanabad will be very difficult for the BJP-JDU to digest
 lalu ke paksh main feet baitha muslim-yadav samikarbarariya upachunaav kaa parinaam nitish kumaar ke liye badi chintaa kaa sabab he, kyonki yahaan lalu ke paksh main muslim-yadav sameekaran feet baitha he
 In Araria, where 42 percent of the Muslims are voters, 10 percent are Yadavs
 in donon virgon ko lalu kaa vot bank mana jaataa he or faisla argedy ke paksh main rahaa he
 What is worrying for Nitish is that when he was with the NDA in the first innings, JDU used to get Muslim votes in the 2004 and 2009 elections, and Nitish's party candidate won both times
 lekin 2014 or ab 2018 ke upachunaavon main muslim voter nitish se chhitaka he
 And this is not a good sign for JDU
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main argedy ke mohammad taslimuddin ko jahaan 4,07,978 vot mili the, vahiin bijepi ke pradeep singh ko 2,61,474 vot mili
 Not only this, Vijay Kumar Mandal of JDU got 2,21,769 votes
 yahi nahin chunaavon se thik pehle sukhdev paswan ne bijepi se naata todakar argedy kaa daaman thama
 Apart from this, former CM Jitanram Manjhi also separated from NDA and befriended RJD
 ye sameekaran bhi argedy ke paksh main ekadam feet baithe hai
 In Bihar, sons have saved their father's legacy
 In Syria, where the late Mohammad Taslimuddin's son Sarfaraz Alam was in the field, the challenge was to save the legacy of his father late Mundrika Yadav in front of Suday Yadav in Jehanabad
 or donon log is par khare utre hai
 Sarfaraz Alam was earlier an MLA from JDU

 In Jehanabad, RJD candidate Krishna Mohan aka Suday Yadav has won
 unhone jediu ke abhiram sharma ko 35036 voton se haraaya he
 The seat was vacant after the death of his father Mundrika Singh Yadav, after which RJD gave him a ticket
 arriya or jahanabad main beton ne pita kii viraasat ko bachaane main kamyaabi pai he
 And the same is true for Tejashwi Yadav
 bihar main nitish kaa lalu ko dagaa denaabihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ek mahagathbandhan kii shakl main janata ke daravaaje par pahunche the
 The public gave a grand majority to the RJD-JDU coalition in favor of the Grand Alliance, but Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar joined the BJP, shocking Lalu Yadav
 arriya-jahanabad upachunaav parinaamon se yah bhi mana ja saktaa he ki janata ne bijepi ke saath jane ke nitish kumaar ke faisle ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 Not only this, the people of Araria and Jehanabad have expressed confidence in the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav as Lalu Yadav's successor

 jaahir he ki 2014 ke chunaavon main narendra modi ne janata se jitne vaade kiye the, un par centre kii sarkaar khari nahin utari he
 There is an atmosphere of anger among the public about bread and employment
 rojgaar ke mudde par chaatr sadakon par hai, to apane haq kii maang kisaan bhi kar rahe hai
 This is the reason why the BJP had to face defeat in the elections from Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh and in the up-bihar by-elections, the BJP has also suffered defeat
 upi main jahaan bijepi ko sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke haathon munh kii khaani padi he
 On the other hand, RJD in Bihar, Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have beaten the BJP

 Maitra added, "pakistan misused the United Nations platform

 bharat ne imran khan ke sambodhan ke jawaab main apane rhite tu riplai kaa istemaal kiya
 The Prime Minister of Pakistan, while chanting the Kashmir issue, demanded that India should remove the 'inhuman curfew' in Kashmir and release all the prisoners
 imran khan kaa yuddh raag piem modi ke usee manch se kuch samay pehle diye gayi shanti sandesh ke thik ulat tha
 Modi said that India is a country that gave the world "war not Buddha"
 pakistan kashmir mudde kaa us samay se antarrashtriyakaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he jab bharat ne paanch agast ko jammu kashmir kaa vishesh darja samaapt kar diya tha
 However, India has termed most sections of Article 370 related to this as an 'internal matter'
 bharat ke is faisle ke baad pakistan ne kathor pratikriya dikhaate hue bharat ke saath apane rajanyik sambandhon ko kamatar kar diya or bhartiya ucchayukta ko apane desh se nishkasit kar diya
 Khan, in his address at the Sanra, referred to India's decision to remove Article 370 and criticized the Indian government for banning media

 ’ RJD chief Lalu Yadav, known as the uncrowned king of Bihar's politics, is in jail these days
 iske baavjood wo raajnneeti main ulatpher karne main lage hai
 Last year, PM Narendra Modi gave Nitish Kumar a big political defeat by separating him from the Grand Alliance and joining Lalu Yadav
 aise main argedy bhi modi se hisaab baraabar karne kii taiyaari main he
 The RJD has indicated to two of its allies to join them

 Kushwaha's friendship with the BJP is that in 2014, the BJP won the political battle with small parties of Bihar
 inamen upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party (RLSP) or ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party bhi shaamil thi
 The result of the alliance with the BJP was that the RLSP party was successful in winning 3 seats in the Lok Sabha and when Modi government was formed, Upendra Kushwaha was awarded the post of minister

 Leaving Nitish Lalu and joining the NDA again, he is running the government

 iske liye upendra kushvaha unke vaaste turup kaa patta sabit ho sakate hai
 Kushwaha hails from Koiri society, Bihar has around 3 per cent of this community's vote, which is extremely useful for Lalu
 bhale hi wo jail main hai lekin unke bete tejasvi in dinon bihar ke daure par hai

 team india buudhvaar ko pehle test match main galle ke maidan par srilanka se do-do haath karegi
 In this match, team India has a heavy eye on Sri Lanka
 lekin is maidan ke aankade viraat kii sena ko daraa rahe hai
 The reason for this is the record of Team India in Gaul
 galle ke maidan par bhartiya team kaa record acha nahin rahaa he, pichhali baar is maidan par bhartiya team ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Two years ago, the Indian team was bowled out for 112 on Gaul's Maidar chasing a target of 176 on the fourth day
 srilanka ne ye match 63 ran se jeeta tha
 That is why Team India is being threatened by Gaulbharat has played a total of four Test matches against Sri Lanka in Gaul, out of which they had lost in 3
 pichley 2 maichon main bharat ko munh kii khaani padi or aise main unka lakshya yahaan haar kii hetric se bachanaa hoga
 India started with defeat at this ground
 srilanka ke khilaaf saal 2001 main 14 se 17 agast tak khele gaye test match main bhartiya team ko 10 wicket se haar mili thi
 After this, India defeated Sri Lanka by 170 runs in the second Test match played from 31 July to 3 August in 2008, but after this, India's journey on this ground was not easy
 srilanka ne 2010 main 18 se 22 july tak khele gaye tisare test match main apni haar kaa badla lete hue bharat ko ek baar phir 10 wicket se haraaya, vahiin saal 2015 main 12 se 15 agast tak khele gaye chauthe test match main srilankai khilaadiyon ne bhartiya team ko 63 ranon se pahada tha
 Team India's record in Gaul Aug 12-15 Aug, 2015 means that Team India will have to avoid a hat-trick of defeats on this ground and Indian captain Virat Kohli in the Sri Lankan team For wrecking the Ube are fully prepared
 kyon galle main srilanka kaa palada he barisrilanka kii baat kii jaae, to usne is maidan par kul 29 match khele hai, jisamen se 17 par usne kabja jamaaya he
 He had lost six matches and had drawn six matches
 srilankai team yahaan do-do maukon par austrailia or pakistan se haari he jabaki ek-ek maukey par use bharat tathaa dakshin africa se haar mili he
 Sri Lanka's recent record in Gaul is much better
 yahaan khele gaye pichley chaar maichon main srilanka ne jeet hasil kii he

 indraprastha prakaashak se prakashit hue kavita sangrah 'raat sapane main' kitaab ke lekhak ramdarsh mishra hai
 The poet Dushyant Kumar once wrote in the spring of the burning forest, "now descending the slope of age, i / i know how to forget you
" apane uttar jivan main pahunchakar vayasashreshth kavi ramdarsh mishra apni kavitaaon, kahaniyon, sansmaranon or upanyaason main apane pichley dinon kii ore laut rahe hai to yah swaabhaavik hi he
 Recently he wrote a novel centered on his wife Saraswati Mishra, and in the same year he recalled her on the pretext of a novel on his character actor late son Hemant Mishra
 in dinon ve bade falak kaa koi kathy bhale na uthaa rahe hon par baithe-thaale unki rachana ke karghe par gazalen, kavitaayen utarati rahati hai or aane-jane waalon ko use sunaakar ve jaise lekhan ke sukh se bhar uthte hai
 Ratna Sapne has a recent collection of her twenties
 ek vakt tha, vasant aata to sidhe unki kavitaaon main utar aata tha, tithi-tyohaar or maan-manuhaar unke geeton main gunj uthte the
 Her rustic heroine used to admire her beloved, did not play the flute again and again
 laharon ke paar bulaao na piya
 When Ramdarsha Mishra, identified with songs, poems and stories, turned to ghazals, it was not known and till now he has written hundreds of such ghazals that Munavvar Rana is romantic by remembering him
 raat sapane main padhate hue lagata he ab ve kavitaaon kii khoj main nahin jate, kavitaayen unki khoj main aati hai, titliyon kii tarah udati hui
 The eyes that have seen a century of traditionalism, modernity and postmodernism, have seen the market silently spread from homes and drawing rooms to an infinite unquenchable plot of desires, those old eyes still have young dreams
 har kavita unke dekhe-sune-bhoge or anubhav kii kaaya main page jivan kaa vrittant he
 In the very first verse, the water and fire that they wish to speak of, in the verses of cooperation, speak of the cohesion of the opposing elements, the same is the embodiment of our common faith; ve pustakon ko apana saathi maanate hai, duniya kii hulchalon se dur rahete hue bhi kavita ke sang jite hai

 com / 0a7gb7fmgn shanivaar der raat mumbai main kalina masjid ke paas rajjak compound main bhupendra veeraa naam ke shaks kii goli markar hatya kar di gai
 The reason for the murder has not been clear yet
 vacola police hatya kaa maamla darj kar aaropee kii talash kar rahi he or saath hi saath hatya ke kaarnon kaa bhi pataa lagane main juty he
 The Aam Aadmi Party criticized the brutal murder, saying that the 72-year-old deceased was an RTI activist and a supporter of his party
 party kaa kahana he ki usne bhu-mafia ke khilaaf kalina main morcha kholaa hua tha
 AAP says that like many properties in the area, the land mafia was also eyeing Bhupendra's property
 haalanki police ne uske aam aadmi party se jude hone kii pushti nahin kii he
 The comments isi bhu-mafia or purv congress korporator ne kareeb chaar saal pehle bhupendra veeraa ke bete ko bhi maar diya tha, jiske baad unhone bhu-mafia ke khilaaf ladane kii bahaduree bharaa kadam uthaaya
 The relentless efforts of Bhupendra resulted in the BMC ordering the demolition of 4 illegal buildings linked to this land mafia
 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki mafia ne bhupendra kii jaan usee din lee jis din yah swayambhu sadhu maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke saath stage par dikhaa
 The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded arrest of the real culprits
 aam aadmi party ne is nrushans hatya kii aalochana karte hue kahana he ki 72 varshiya mritak ek artiai kaaryakarta tha or unki party kaa samarthak tha
 The party says that it had opened a front against the land mafia in Kalina
 AAP kaa kahana he ki ilaake kii kai property kii tarah hi bhu-mafia kii najar bhupendra kii property par bhi thi
 However, the police have not confirmed his involvement with the Aam Aadmi Party
 tippaniyan The same land mafia and former Congress corporator also killed Bhupendra Veera's son about four years ago, after which he took the brave step to fight against the land mafia
 bhupendra ke hi athak prayaason kaa asar hua ki biemasi ne is bhu-mafia se judi 4 avaidh imaaraton ko giraane kaa aadesh diya
 It is no coincidence that the mafia killed Bhupendra on the same day that this self-proclaimed monk appeared on stage with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 aam aadmi party ne asli doshiyon ko giraftaar karne kii maang kii he

 He said that Matthew Wade was present behind the wicket, he clearly saw that if the ball did not hit the stokes, it would have been in the stumps

 However, even after the match was over, Oyen Morgan and Steven Smith had an inside discussion on the issue, in which the two were seen to be dissimilar to each other

 Morgan, however, made it clear that their disagreement did not mean Smith should have withdrawn his appeal
 unhone is pahalu par kaha, unhen apil karne kaa adhikaar he
 He would have appealed if he thought Stokes was out
 tippaniyan On the other hand Steven Smith is justifying the attitude of the Australian team in this matter
 unhone kaha ki wicket ke peeche mathew vade maujuud the, unhen spasht taur par yah dikhaai de rahaa tha ki gend stokes se nahin takaraati to stamps main lagati

 bijepi gupachup hi sahi modi ke peeche-peeche daudane lagi he
 But JDU also has to set its agenda and the matter may get stuck in this affair

 JDU has said that it has set the principle in the matter of the post of Prime Minister
 jediu saansad ali anwar ansaari ne kaha, 'hamane siddhant tay kar diya he
 The candidate for this post should be of secular background and should carry all along and should be the spokesperson for the rights of backward states
 'unhone kaha ki endie apane pradhanmantri pratyaashee ke bare main faisla legaa or bade ghatak ke rup main bhartiya janata party ko ek naam prastaavit karnaa hoga
 He said, 'the final decision will be taken in the NDA meeting

 While the opinion of Shiv Sena is somewhat different

 Actually JDU national executive meeting is going to be held in Delhi on 13th of this month
 do din tak chalane vaali is baithak main party ke sabhi diggaj maujuud rahenge
 It is believed that during this time, BJP will be asked to clear the stand on the candidate for the post of PM

 Regarding bjp's prime ministerial candidate in the next Lok Sabha election, Nitish said that this is an internal issue of BJP, we do not need to interfere in it
 unhone mediakarmiyon se kaha ki JDU kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main jo raay banegi usase NDA ke saath-saath aap sabhi ko avgat karaayaa jayega
 Ever since the discussion of Modi's name in BJP has intensified, a short distance between JDU and BJP has started coming
 bihar BJP ke kuch netaa bhi lagaataar modi ke gungan me jute hue hai
 Which has had an impact on the relationship between the two parties
 NDA ke PM pratyaashee ko lekar JDU adhyaksh sharad yadav ne ishaaron main narendra modi kii daavedaari ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 He said, 'we are not against any person
 par hamaare kuch siddhant hai jinke saath samjhauta nahin ho saktaa he
 At the same time, his own party MP Maheshwar Hazari said that Nitish Kumar has already clarified his position regarding the PM candidate
 BJP kise apana ummidavaar bananaa chaahati he yah unka andruni maamla he
 We will decide when the time comes
 haalanki BJP ne bharosa jataayaa he ki NDA gathbandhan ko koi khatra nahin he
 BJP leader Kirti Azad said that there is no threat to the alliance
 hamaara gathbandhan or bhi majboot hua he
 Kirti Azad also made it clear that the party's parliamentary committee will take the final decision on the PM candidate
 JDU-BJP ke bich tanaav kii khabaren saamne ain to virodhiyon ko chutki lene kaa mauka mil gaya
 Congress leader Harish Rawat said that Modi wants to create an image that does not match his deeds

 a few days ago, bjp's main ally JDU had targeted Narendra Modi, saying that he was 'desperate' to become Prime Minister, while his model of Gujarat development is non-inclusive
 JDU netaa shivanand tiwari ne kaha ki modi pehle hi maan chuke hai ki ve BJP ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hai
 However, BJP had said that its parliamentary board will decide the prime ministerial candidate
 ’udhar punjab ke upmukhyamantri sukhvir singh badal ne kaha he ki akali dal BJP dwaara ghoshit pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar kaa samarthan karegaa
 Though the Shiv Sena has a different opinion
 shiv sena pramukh uddhav thakare kaa kahana he ki NDA pehle apana ummidavaar tay kar len phir ham apni raay rakhenge
 Obviously, the political confusion of NDA is stuck around Modi
 gandhinagar se dilli kii ore farrata daud laga rahe modi ab baadha daud main funs gaye hai
 And hindrance is his old rival Nitish Kumar

 In the monsoon session, the party feels that this time there are many issues on which all the regional parties will also stand against the government and the government will have to go on backfoot
 congress ne muddon kii talash main is baat kaa khaas khyaal rakhaa he ki us pargandhi parivaarake liye hi sirf ladaai ladane kii tohamat na lage or vipakshi chhitak na jaaen
 The Congress will come up with issues that are related to the people or the rights of the state governments, so that it can strengthen the opposition unity
 congress ne is baar apane muddon kaa top 5 banaaya he, jiske jariye wo sarkaar ko gheregi-1
 Role of Center and Governor in Arunachal and Uttarakhand: Congress will seek answers from the government on this issue
 usko lagata he ki tamaam raajnneetik dal is mudde par uskaa saath denge
 Even after the stand of the government's ally Shiv Sena, it is quite excited
 2
 Inflation: This is the issue against which the opposition can be mobilized easily
 lekin congress kaa kirdaar ahm rahe, isiilie 20 july ko party jantar-mantar par bada virodh-pradarshan bhi isi mudde par karegi
 The party should be prepared for the upa's tenure with today's inflation and the BJP leaders should be reminded at that time
 3
 Kashmir issue: The situation in Jammu and Kashmir is worrisome, the party will also raise this issue in the Parliament and the blame will fall on the central and state government
 4
 Foreign Policy: Pakistan's bullying on Kashmir, the nsg's case and China's attitude on Kashmir, combined with all this, will put the government under siege on its foreign policy
 5
 Center and State Issues: After the recent meeting between the Center and the state, the Congress has gained strength due to the stand of Mamta, Kejriwal and Akalis
 wo chaahati he ki centre ke rukh kii kshetreey dal aalochana karen or wo aguva ban is mudde par vipakshi ekta ke saath sarkaar se bhide
 In contact with the leaders of opposition parties, Congress is in touch with all the parties like JDU, NCP, RJD and Left on these issues
 upi chunaav ke lihaaj se wo bispi or espi ko lekar jarur satark he
 Congress on backfoot on GST bill After all parties agree on this bill, Congress is definitely on backfoot
 sarkaar or party ke bich 18 fisadi par cap ko samvidhan sanshodhan main rakhane par vivaad he
 However, according to sources, the party, taking a flexible approach on this, will no longer insist on keeping it in the Constitution amendment
 sarkaar se iske liye vikalp ke taur par kisi kanoonee suraksha kii maang karegi or sarkaar ke jawaab kaa intjaar karegi
 Even on everyday issues, if a big issue comes up during the Parliament session, then the party will not delay in catching it too
 rajyasabha par pehle kii tarah rahegaa jorcongress ko maaloom he ki loksabhaa main uskaa ankaganit kamjor he
 Therefore, more emphasis will be on Rajya Sabha
 darasal, rajyasabha ke hi chalate wo apana plan upi tay karne main deree tak kar rahi he, kyonki upi ke prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa hai, rajbabbar , sanjay singh, pramod tiwari, pi el punia bhi rajyasabha saansad hai

 com / edwzgap3wt— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi)july 17, 2019 The health of women is taken care of both before and after pregnancy
 pregnancy ke dauraan jahaan doodh-fal or protein zyada lene kar kii salaah di jaati he to vahiin delivery ke baad khaane main thos aahaar ko praathamikta di jaati he
 Pure native ghee of cow is very beneficial for health
 gaay kaa ghi swasthya ke liye phydemand hone ke kaaran adhiktar doctor delivery ke baad mahilaon ko iskaa seven karne kii hidaayat dete hai
 Why Ghee is beneficial: Ghee contains more nutrients than vegetable oil
 is kaaran rojaanaa ghi kaa ek baar seven karnaa jaruri he
 Ghee after olive oil is very beneficial for health, but excessive use of ghee is also harmful to health
 zyada calories vaala khaanaa khaane se bachendelivery ke baad mahilaon ko adhik calories vaala bhojan nahin karnaa chahie
 Especially, more oily foods should not be consumed at all, but after delivery women also need to eat good food for health
 aise main doctor ghi se bani chizon kaa seven karne kii hidaayat dete hai
 Benefits of eating Ghee
 
 
 1
 There is a lack of lubrication in the joints of women after delivery
 isliye calcium yukt bhojan kaa seven karnaa chahie
 These foods made in ghee provide more amount of nutrients
 2
 Women who are migraine patients must use the pod after vodilivari
 3
 Eating ghee is also beneficial to avoid weakness after delivery

 - Never do Rudrabhishek without seeing Shiva's abode, bad effect happens
 - shiv ji kaa nivas tabhi dekhen jabamanokamana purti ke liye abhishek karnaa ho
 When Shiva ji's residence is auspicious? Mahadev, the god of gods, roams the universe
 mahadev kabhi maa gauri ke saath hote hai to kabhi-kabhi kailash par virajte hai
 According to astrologers, Rudrabhishek should be done only when the residence of Shiva is in auspiciousness

 - Mahadev stays on Kailash even on Panchami and Dwadashi of Shukla Paksha

 - In Shukla Paksha's Tritiya and Dashami, Mahadev hears problems of the gods
 - krishnapaksh kii tritiya or dashami ko nataraj krida main vyast rahete hai
 Nataraja is also busy in sports on the Chaturthi and Ekadashi of Shuklapaksha
 - krishnapaksh kii shashthee or trayodashi ko rudra bhojan karte hai
 - Rudra feeds on Saptami and Chaturdashi of Shuklapaksha
 - in tithiyon main manokamana purti ke liye abhishek nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 When dates are not considered? Some fasts and festivals are always auspicious for Rudrabhishek
 un dinon main tithiyon kaa dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 
 
 - Shivaratri does not consider Shiva's abode on Monday of Pradosh and Sawan
 - siddh peeth yaa jyotirling ke kshetra main bhi shiv ke nivas par vichaar nahin karte
 - For Rudrabhishek both these place and time are always favorable
 shiv krupa se aapaki sabhi manokamana jarur puri hongi to aapke man main jaisi kaamana ho vaisaa hi rudrabhishek kariye or apane jivan ko shubh ore mangalamay banaaie

 It is being said that due to this, the inspector was suspended
 bollywood film 'bade miyaan-chote miyaan' ke govinda vaale gane par pakistan ke daaroga ek mahila ke saath dance karte hue najar aa rahe hai
 The video of these daroga ji dancing to the songs of Govinda is becoming very viral in India and Pakistan
 aap bhi pehle is video ko dekh lijie
 It is being said about this video viral on social media that what this policeman of Pakistan Police did on Govinda's song, it was suspended
 hamane is video kaa viral test kiya
 This video, which is going viral on social media, is being told that the person dancing in uniform is named Inspector Arshad, who is posted in Pakpatan area of central Punjab province of Pakistan
 jab is viral video ke bare main pakistan police ke adhikariyon ko pataa chalaa to unhone aanan-fanan main arashad ko suspend kar diya
 This news also made a lot of headlines in Pakistan's media
 lekin hamaare viral test main to kahani bilkul palat gai
 We came to know that the man dancing in a police uniform in the video is not an inspector, but an actor, and is named Shehzad Ashi
 yah video ek kaarykram ke abhyaas ke dauraan kisi ne bana liya or use use soshal media par viral kar diya
 Now Shahzad Mian has become conscious
 ek news channel se baat karte hue shahzad ashi or saathi adaakara khubasurat caff ne bataaya ki unka police se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 On the other hand, another video went viral in Pakistan's Pakpatnam area and in that video also a policeman was in uniform, but he was not dancing

 After the video went viral, Arogaad, while talking to private channels, said that this video was actually uploaded on social media by my nephew
 use andaja nahin tha ki main police uniform main hum
 i am very embarrassed about this
 is video ko na chalaaya jaae
 The misunderstanding spread because the actors Shahzad Ashi and Daroga Arshad face each other, so people considered Shahzad Ashi as Daroga Arshad
 baad main abhinayta shahzad ashi or viral video main dikhne vaali ladki ne pakistan ke ek news channel main jaakar viral hue video ke bare main bataaya or ek baar phir usee gane par thumkaa lagaaya

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ” RJD chief Lalu Yadav is telling his victory over reservation case to professor and associate professor in college and university
 lalu yadav ne do din pehle hi ye daawa kiya tha ki ujisi kii taraf se vishvavidhyalayon ko speed post se aadesh bheja gaya he ki professor or associat professor ke padon par obisi kaa aarakshan khatm kar diya jaae
 After that, Lalu Yadav lifted the sky on his head
 ujisi ne lalu ke daavon ko nakaralalu yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ye sab sangh ke ishaare par kar rahi he or mohan bhagwat ne pehle hi aarakshan khatm karne kii baat kahi thi
 Lalu Yadav said that he will not tolerate abolition of reservation and agitate for it
 jab maamle ne tool pakadaa to ujisi ne is bare main spashtikaran jari kiya or kaha ki aarakshan ke bare main nitiyon main koi badwaal nahin hua he
 Just then what was the basis of this explanation of the UGC, Lalu claimed victory and tweeted, 'this is the effect of the powerful voice of 85% majority of the country, not Lalu
 kendra ko kal hi chetaya tha or kal hi role back kar liya'
 The logic of the UGC - there is no change in the rule but the truth is something else
 ujisi ke vaais chairman ech devraj ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main saaf kaha ki koi rolebag nahin hua he
 As before, reservation is not applicable at any level except Assistant Professor
 ech devraj ne saaf kiya ki 2007 se lekar abtak ujisi main aarakshan ko lekar koi badlaab hua hi nahin he isliye rolebag kaa koi sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota
 The law made in 2006 is still continuing that there are three posts of teachers in college and university
 sabase shuruaati assistant professor jise pehle lekcharaar kaha jaataa he
 He is followed by Associate Professor and then Professor
 anusuchit jati ke logon ko in teenon padon paraarakshanka laabh miltaa he or wo abhi bhi jari he
 In 2006, the UPA decided to give 27 per cent reservation to the obcs in the reinstatement of the earliest post, ie Assistant Professor, which was implemented from 2007, the same system has been in place ever since
 isliye lalu yadav ujisi ke jis faisle ko rolebag karaane kii baat kar rahe hai wo faisla darasal hua hi nahin he
 It is the rule to ring the bell before entering inside the temple for worship
 isaki vajah sirf dharmik nahin, vaigyanik bhi he
 It is said that when the bell is rung, vibration is created in the atmosphere and it goes far due to the atmosphere

 4 vajahen jiske liye bajaani chahie mandir main ghanti :1
 The ringing of the bell is believed to awaken consciousness in the idols of the deities installed in the temple, after which their worship and worship become more fruitful and impressive
 2
 The auspicious sound of the bell empowers the mind-brain to lead to spirituality
 subah or shaam jab bhi mandir main puja yaa aarti hoti he to ek lay or vishesh dhun ke saath ghantiyaan bajaai jaati hai
 This leads to a feeling of peace and divine presence
 3
 When the creation started, the sound (sound) echoed when the bell rang
 ghanti isi naad kaa pratik maani jaati he
 This is also awakened by the utterance of Nad'onkar
 4
 The bell or hour outside the temple has also been considered a symbol of time
 manyataon main pralay se bachane ke liye ghanti bajaanaa bataaya gaya he
 These are 10 famous temples of Lord Vishnu
 
 
 vahiin mandiron main ek nahin, 4 prakaar kii ghantiyaan hoti hai
 These are -1
 garud ghanti: yah choti ghanti hoti he jise ek haath se bajaayaa ja saktaa he
 2
 dwaar ghanti:madhyam aakaar kii ghanti jo dwaar par lataki hoti he
 3
 haath ghanti:pital kii thos ek gol plate kii tarah hoti he jisko lakdi ke ek gadde se thokkar bajaate hai
 4
 ghanta:yah bahut bada hota he or ise bajaane par aawaaj kai kilometre tak jaati he
 Chant these mantras for success

 He said that the government of Gujarat should investigate and whosoever is guilty should be punished
