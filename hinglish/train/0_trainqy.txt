 Relief on this biography states that "haphazard pieces cut from a cardboard that has grown old for half a century by shaking eyes with anonymous and unknown seasons like summer, winter, rain, sun-shade, or so Say that most of the paper of this book is so wet that it is ready to be applied on the present tahrir, but the insistence of the author of this book has made every effort to make it orderly

 Because the demand for relief is everywhere in the country and abroad
 idhar deepak ke paas koi dhang kii naukari bhi nahin so paise kii tangi alag par is sabake baavjood deepak ruhani ne hausala nahin khoyaa
 This was a very important moment for Deepak when Red Venge Kesari, the publisher of Redgrab Books, offered to write this biography to him
 venus khud urdu gajalon main maharath rakhte hai tathaa ek behtareen kitaab urdu kii ghazal ke vyakaran par likh kar apni salaahiyat kaa loha manavaa chuke hai
 It was helped by Shira publisher Parag Aggarwal, partner of Venus, who hails from Indore

 Publishers also made serious efforts to release this biography on the stage of Sahitya Aaj Tak 2019

 Biographer Deepak Rouhanideepak is born in Awadh Bhadarikalan, Lalganj where Khanty Awadhi is spoken
 par shuru se hi deepak ko shaayari se lagaav tha, lihaaja urdu kii talim bhi hasil kii
 In the early stages, he had a lot of wisdom in the town, he has contributed a lot in grooming the intellectual character of many, even in writing the phd of many, but "how many people have come back and forth, we did not like the pen disease
" ''

 But even in these days of poverty, he would have great dreams in the world of glory

 Deepak's stature when he translated a very challenging translation of Mir's poem 'indian Poetry and Indian Aesthetics' by Shamsur Rahman Farooqui for the Indian Jnanpith and Waris Kirmani's former Department Head of the Personnel Department of Aligarh Muslim University titled 'swirling River' Realized ab jab do saal pehle uthaaya raahat saab kii jeevani kaam puraa hone ko aayaa to jaise raahat saab kii duaen bhi faleebhoot huin or deepak madhubani main assistant professor ban chuke hai or raahat sahab par apni jeevani se ve bhi ek lekhak ke bataur khaasaa makabool ho rahe hai
 When asked how the idea of writing a relief biography of Rahat Sahab came to mind, Deepak Rouhani said that he was related to the poetry of Rahat Sahab long back, but the idea of writing a biography of Rahat Sahab was suggested by Bhai Parag Agarwal
 unka raahat sahab se purana sampark tha
 Parag hails from the neighboring district of Dhar in Indore and is a great fan of Rahat Sahab
 main khwaab main bhi nahin soch saktaa tha ki raahat sahab mere jaise aadmi ko mil sakate hai or wo bhi apni zindagi kii daastaan bataane ke liye
 After two years of tireless hard work Deepak had a meeting with him about eight or ten times in Indore and twice in Lucknow for this biography of Sahab
 rishtedaaron se bhi do-teen baar, kuch doston se bhi ekaadhik baar
 Dewas had to go to meet relatives many times, then he had to go to Pune to meet a childhood friend of his
 aksar log kisi sine celibrity par likhte hai uski makabuuliyat ke kaaran is lihaaj se ek shaayar ke rup main aisi kya khaasiyat unamem lageen ki ve is jeevani ke centrebindu bane
 Deepak says, as a poet, Rahat Sahab does not have one or two specialties but a lot of features, which are mentioned in this book in order
 mukhya khasiyaton main raahat sahab kaa vyaktigat swabhaav sarvopari he
 Apart from this, his democratic commitment, political awareness, linguistic consciousness, the maintenance of traditional subjects, the way of presenting the lion and remaining loyal to his ideology are also some of his special features
 main unase poochta hum log intervyuuj main apni nijee jindagi ke panne bahut kam hi kholte hai, kaise lage raahat saab aise nijee sawaal par bolte hue
 He openly answered a lot of questions in private life
 kuch bhi chupaane jaisaa unke swabhaav main nahin dikhaa, balki kai baaten maine unase jaanane ke baad bhi khulkar nahin likh paaya, sach to yah ki unhone apane kisi aib ke bare main kahin kuch nahin chupaaya,'' deepak ne mere sawaal kaa uttar dete hue kaha
 While writing biography, something which has touched the mind, any such incident which has become memorable, Deepak said, "while writing biography many things came to the fore that touched the heart
 kuch baaten to unke rishtedaaron or doston kii bataayi hui thim to kuch unki khud kii bataayi hui thim
 Especially those things which touched the heart of childhood and youth were very much touched
 bachapan se hi ve kamai main mubtila ho gayi or kis-kis tarah se sangharsh karte hue yahaan tak pahunche, yah kehete hue ve bhavuk ho uthte the
 Relieved to be happy with this biography, the author is often not convinced by critics about his assessment
 lekhak ko sabase raahat kii baat yahi lagati he ki koi unhen thik se samajhe
 Today, when the book is in front, all the pages of Rahat Saab's life are open, there is a curiosity to know what Rahat Saab's opinion will be on this
 raahat saab ek video main kehete hai, '' meri shanaakht or meri pahchaan kaa jo marahala he usamen is kadar bikharaav hai ki mujh tak pahuchanne main khud mujhe bhi koi aadhi sadi se zyada guzar gaye par badi dushwari ai
 For a long time, there was a desire that there should be a way to get such a person, to help me reach my identity and reach me personally
 yah kaary dushwaar tha magar meri mulaakaat khushnaseebi se ek aise shaks se hui deepak ruhani ki jisane meri ruh tak ko chhu kar mujhe pahchaanane kii koshish kii or ek aisi kitaab tarateeb de di jise har varak par mujhe pard kar aisa mahasoos hua ki main to apni shaksayit yaa banaavat ke is pahalu se waakif hi nahin tha
 This was a great feat
 main iske liye unhen mubarakawaad pesh karata hum
 There were dozens of people from my family that i did not even meet
 unase meraa taaruf deepak ne is kitaab main karavaaya or yah ek meri jindagi kaa lagbhag ek mukammal dastavej he or chahta hum ki is kitaab ko log padh kar mujhe pahachaanen or mere baad bhi, mir kii tarah lakhanu ke city stesan kii kisi patari ke bich main dabaa hua na houn balki log mujhe is hawaale se bhi jaan saken ki yahaan vah jagah he jahaan raahat saab dafn hai
 "rahat Saab, reading this book, has called it a black white film of the fifties
" bakaul raahat, ''mujhe is baat kaa etr he ki main us tamaashe ko bhi dikhaane main kahin-kahin taqalluf barat gaya hum jo tamaasha mere aage hota rahaa he
 This book is like a black and white film of the fifties and sixties in which a recognizable picture sometimes loses its voice and sometimes screams, i wish people would recognize this picture which they have no effort in making whose picture is
 
 
 ''is pustak ke bare main raahat sahab farmaate hai ki ''is pustak main meri jindagi, main mushaairon kaa jo safar he vah aadhi sadi se kuch zyada he
 And the incidents that took place in these Mushayars, the accidents that happened, the meetings that happened with the people, these were written, or if they were given a book, i think a big story would be ready
 lekin deepak ne in baton se gurej to nahin kiya un tamaam nijal baton ko liya he jinke bagaiyr meraa portate teyar nahin ho saktaa tha
 It is a matter of happiness that many such things which had not reached me or had reached me, i had forgotten many times, they are included in this
 "meri bahut puraani khwaahish thi ki aisi koi kitaab aae or ye kitba aaj hamaare hatho main he
 It is a spectacle of a way that i cannot even see myself and cannot even tell, but with my name, with my name, with my clan, with my children, with my family, With my poetry, with my mood, with my love, my picture is reaching the world, it is a matter of pride and respect for me
 '' raahat sahab kaa apni hi jeevani ko pard kar ye baaten kahana na keval unke jeevanikar deepak ruhani ke liye ek inam kii tarah he balki unke karodon chaahane waalon ke liye yah ek aisi jindagi kaa safarnama he jo unki jaati jindagi ke aise anek lamahon se rubaru ho sakenge jinase hokar shaayari phuli fali or paravaan chadhi he
 This biography is divided into nine chapters, the biography of Rahat Saheb, which will be launched in this time, today, his biography Deepak Rouhani has written from Roh
 unke saarvajanik va jaati jindagi ke ek ek pahalu ko badi baariki se sanjoya he deepak ne
 Each chapter of this biography, divided into nine chapters, is based on the rough lion of Rahat Saab
 aksar shaayar yaa kavi apni aatmakatha nahin likhte
 Yevantushko used to say that the poem of the poet is his autobiography
 raahat kii shaayari main unki aatmakatha bhi piroi hui dikhti he
 Their joys, sorrows, their feelings are all part of their lives
 
 
 jivan jo shaayari me utani hi shiddat se guntha hua he
 Our sharara is found through such dervishes, my spring is in the vase of my house, its picture will be complete in this way, any picture made in my vatha made with jewelery, i sell it with a ghazal ferry, rahate-indore: Rahat Indorei, someone else Just like you, you do not know the relief, Gajal says in the support of the everyday stone, like the research car done in the Appendix with Purulaf and Manikhej chapters
 If, awards, films, has saved the pictures
 raahat indore main 1 janvari 1950 ko kapadaa mil ke karmchaaree raftullah kuraishi or makabool un nisha begum ke yahaan janme
 He got his initial training at Nutan School Indore
 islamia kareemia college indore se 1973 main unhone snaatak kiya or 1975 main barkatullah vishvavidhyalay, bhopal se urdu sahitya main eme karne ke baad 1985 main bhopal vishvavidhyalay se urdu sahitya main piechdi kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 Later, for some time, Rahat Sahib started teaching Urdu literature at Indrakumar College, Indore
 par shaayari or mushaairon kii vyastataayen raahat sahab ko zyada der tak isse baandh kar nahin rakh sakin or ve desh videsh main shaayari ke chaahane waalon ke dilon main nivas karte rahe
 a whole world of relief and poetry is not just relief in this biography, they are, the princely state of Indore, there is an atmosphere, there are khandari people, siblings, sharike hyatt, children and nate relatives too
 yahaan tak ki jo bhi raahat ko jaraa bhi jaanata he or uske paas raahat ke jivan kii koi na koi ahm vakya he use darj karne kaa bidaa deepak ruhani ne yahaan uthaaya he
 That is why this two and a half hundred biography by adding straws is a complete document of the last two days of relief
 bahut kam log jaanate honge ki raahat kaa jivan sangharshon se hokar gujara he
 He also learned painting to get employment
 kalaarthi se raahat studio tak kaa safar bhi unke hisse main he
 He had many companions in this journey
 unki jindadil tasviren yahaan unke saath darj hai
 She did not receive any inheritance
 indore ke adbi maahaul se unhone bahut kuch siikhaa or pehle mushaayare se lekar aaj tak unhone apni pahchaan kaa paracham puri duniya main fahraaya he
 Even like the houses of music, he populated a house of poetry in Indore
 shaayari main indore kalam kii apni pahchaan he
 By now it is difficult to count the number of mushairas in Rahat Saab
 jab mushaairon main unki charam lokapriyata ko choote hue unki shaayari kii khushboo baliwood tak pahunchi to filmon main bhi geet likhane kii shuruyaat kii
 There they acquired new experiences
 unke jivan kii anek choti choti kahaniyaan yahaan deepak ne bayaan kii hai
 His court is always open for anyone to come
 ek baar kii baat he ve morari baapu ke saath landan main the
 Bapu had sent separate food items in his room
 raahat saab aalasy kii vajah se apane kamare main hi manga kar kuch kha lete the
 Before going to the restaurant and eating something, a Bhopal gentleman living in London came to meet him
 kaaphi samay unase guftgu main guzar gaya bina khaae piye
 At last, when the gentleman left and there was no news till late, he was seen unconscious when the door was opened
 raahat sahab ko sugar thi, jisamen thodethode samay par khate rahanaa jaruri hota he
 His BP was quite low at that time
 doctoron kii team ne kisi tarah unhen thik kiya
 When Rahat washed his clothes at a small station in Jaunpur, today he may have his reign in Mushayars and his presence every year on the most spectacular literary stage in the country, but he has narrated an early story that once he went to Banaras Mushaire Was and was going from Lucknow to Jaunpur via Benares
 kapadaa vahi tha jise pahana tha or vah ganda ho chukaa tha
 The second was not so, after getting down at the Zafarabad station before Jaunpur, he washed and dried clothes on a handpipe, and after wearing them again, reached another place in Varanasi
 us vakt mushaairon main pement itnaa kam tha ki usase ek dhang kaa kapadaa kharid paanaa bhi mushkil ho jaae
 This was the struggle of a poet in favor of adulthood by raising enemies
 aaj bhi ve shaayari main satta kii kasidekari nahin karte balki aam aadmi kii baat karte hai
 His trance shayari may not be digested by all, but every man who likes it is fond of relief shayari
 aksar ve mushaairon main padhate vakt pehle darshakon va samayin kii maansikta va unke str ko pahchaanane kii koshish karte hai
 If the cheerleaders are in public then they work with light shayari
 par yadi sanjeeda shrota hue to ve clasik str kii shaayari ke khajaane ko ek-ek kar kholte hai
 Once Tufail Chaturvedi told him that why don't you read your amazing ghazals on stage, Rahat Saab said that Samayin does not want that
 usee raat auditorium main hue mushaayare main raahat sanjeeda shaayari se shuruyaat kii
 Most silent
 pratikriyavihin ki raahat saab ne kone main baithe tufail ko dekh liya or kaha ki tufail tum puch rahe the na ki mushaairon main main adab kyon nahin padhata
 See what would happen when you read the adobe
 ab dekho yahaan se mushayara shuru kar rahaa hum
 Then Rahat Saab returned to his tried game and filled the auditorium with the noise of the audience
 jo log raahat sahab ko pasand karte rahe hai, ve is baar bhisahitya ajtakake manch par unka jalawaa dekhenge
 Not only the poet, Seema, a homemaker's wife, says about Rahat Saab, saying that even though i came on a rented bicycle, i never let myself feel the lack
 unhone har dam meraa khyal rakhaa
 Before i spoke, i used to present what i wanted
 kiraaye kii cycle vaala bhi unase kiraaya nahin letaa tha kyonki ve painting kaa kaam jaanate the or jab jarurat hoti thi ve yah kaam uske liye muft kar dete the
 The father's financial condition was not good for this, when he studied in Nutan High School, from then on he started learning to work in Jyoti Arts nearby
 skool se ghar aate ki kha pi kar jyoti arts kii taraf
 Colors would get involved in the work of brush banners etc
 iske liye chagan guru jo bhi mehtaanaa dete ve rakh lete, kabhi maanga nahin
 That is, Rahat was not just a poet, he was also a qualified son and householder who helped a caring husband and father
 gaye chaar dashakon se shaayari kii mehphilon main logon ke dilon par raaj karne vaale raahat clasiki shaayari or lokapriy shaayari ke bich pul banane vaale shaayar hai jinhone urdu shaayari ko puri duniya main failaayaa he
 Like the Ajan facing Anant, the life-giving reliefs in shayari not only have a distinct identity in the relief crowd but are also heard and appreciated due to their different voices
 ek shaayar kaa jivan uski shaayari ke nepathy main dabaa rahata he vah kitna ujala he kitna matamaila yah koi us par likhane vaala hi bataa saktaa he
 Deepak has given a strong instrument in the life of relief under the pretext of his biography which is in discussion these days
 iske duusare khand par bhi unka kaam chal rahaa he jahaan raahat apni jindagi se baahar nikal kar desh duniya ke halaat or apane samakalinon ke bare main bhi khul kar bolenge, aisi ham ummid karte hai
 So this time a chance to meet Rahat Indori
 sidhe unhen sunne or unase kitaab hastakshrit karaane kaa mauka na chuken

 In order to bring development to the village in the Naxal-affected Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, the police have shown the difficult task of constructing a road by cutting the mountain
 pehle jahaan upar pahunchane ke liye paidal chalanaa mushkil tha ab vahaan motor car pahunchane lagi he, jisase police ke prati logon kaa vishwaas badha he
 From Chhattisgarh's North Bastar Kanker district headquarters, move towards the Naxal-affected Amabeda area, Mardakoti Gram Panchayat, which is surrounded by mountains, about 20 kilometers to the south, welcomes you
 ghati kshetra vaali is gram panchayat ke antargat paanch gaanvon kaa samooh he jisamen jurramaari, heeraadah, mardakoti, malajkudum or marrapi gaanv aate hai
 The natural beauty of the region binds you just like you, but the people living in the villages situated on the mountains here live life in very difficult conditions
 inhi gaanvon main se ek gaanv he marrapi jo lagbhag saat sau meter oonchi pahari par basaa he
 There is now road, electricity, clean drinking water, school and there are teachers in the school
 lekin chah maheene pehle tak yah sab buniyadi suvidhaayen yahaan ke logon ke liye sapana thim
 The police here have tried to make this dream a reality
 mardakoti gram panchayat kii sarpanch asita kumeti ke pati ramanand kumeti bataate hai ki sadiyon se based is gaanv kii jansankhya 380 he
 a few months ago, the biggest problem was to reach this village
 sidhi chadhaai vaale pahaad ke upar based gaanv tak pahunchane ke liye ek pagadendi thi
 Through this trail, villagers used to come from here only with the help of sticks
 kumeti kehete hai ki gaanv main paanchavi kaksha tak skool he lekin lambey samay tak vahaan shikshak nahin tha
 When the teacher was appointed, he seldom used to come here because he had to reach the school by climbing his bicycle or motorcycle under the mountain
 gaanv main koi biimaar ho jaae to use kanvad ke sahare neeche utaarna hota tha or phir motorcycle yaa anya sadhano se aspataal pahunchaana hota tha
 The nearest hospital from here is at the district headquarters of Kanker
 unhone bataaya ki pahaad par chadhane or utarane ke dauraan aksar log girakar gambhir rup se ghayal bhi ho jate hai
 Apart from this, there was no clean drinking water system in the village
 rashan kii dukaan nahin tha, bijli nahin thi
 This means that there was a village, there were also people, but there was nothing for them
 lekin pichley saal nanvabar ke baad yahaan badlaav shuru hua
 The road was built with the help of police, then reached the district administration and now there is a hand pump in the village, there are teachers in the school, there is also a small grocery store
 gaanv kii praathmik shaala ke pradhan pathak rasaalu ram kavasi bataate hai ki skool main 34 chaatr chatraayen hai
 He is currently teaching in his village Marrapi
 isse pehle vah antagarh vikaskhand main the
 Kavasi says that he lives in Marrapi so there is no problem in reaching school
 lekin duusare shikshakon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 He used to leave his vehicle below in the village and climbed the mountain and reached the school
 barish ke dinon main samasya or bad jaati thi
 He says that once a villager was taken ill, he was brought down in a basket
 pahaad katkar sadak banane or gaanv tak vikaas pahunchane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale kanker jile ke police adheekshak ke el dhruv kehete hai ki pichley varsh sitambar main unka tabadalaa bijapur jile se kanker jile main hua
 When he was making his strategy against the Naxalites here, it was decided that the hearts of the villagers should be won so that they do not deviate from the mainstream
 is dauraan unhen marrapi or kuch duuri par based jeevalamaari gaanv ke bare main jaankaree mili
 When the villagers of Marrapi and Jeevlamari village came to meet them at the district headquarters, they demanded a road to the village and invited them to come there
 dhruv bataate hai ki marrapi gaanv pahunchane par pahaad kii sidhi chadhaai ne unhen graminon kii samasya kaa ahsaas dilaa diya or unhone usee din vahaan sadak banane kaa iraadaa kar liya
 For this, the villagers also assured full cooperation
 police adheekshak bataate hai ki november main marrapi tak rasta banane kaa kaam shuru hua or pahaad kaatane kii mashiinon ke saath police ke jawan, mahila commando or gramin sadak banane ke is kathin kaam main jute gaye
 In this extreme Naxal-affected area, the villagers would work for road construction and provide police protection
 kshetra main police saptaah bhar shivi lagaati, sadak banati phir waapas aa jaati
 This cycle continued and in two months, a road of about six kilometers was completed
 yah gaanv waalon or police javaanon ke liye kisi sapane ke puure hone jaisaa tha
 Dhruv says that after the completion of road construction work, a public troubleshooting camp was organized here in January this year, for the first time after independence, a collector reached this village
 is shivi main jila prashasan ne bhi graminon ko puraa sahyog karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Later, hand pumps were installed in the village, paddy mowing machines and help was made to open ration shops
 police adheekshak bataate hai ki sadak nirmaan ke dauraan naksaliyon ne graminon ko police ke khilaaf bhadakaane kii koshish kii
 The Naxalites told the villagers that the police would build a camp here after the road was built, but the Naxalites also did not oppose the road when the villagers did not listen to them
 vah kehete hai ki police ne sadak to bana di he lekin barish main agar sadak bah gai to mushkilen phir bad jaaengi, lihaaja yahaan pakki sadak banane ke liye jila prashasan or van vibhaag se baat ho rahi he
 It is expected that construction of a paved road will start soon
 dhruvakehte hai ki marrapi tak sadak banane ke baad kshetra main logon kaa police par vishwaas badha he
 The work of cutting the mountain has also been started to construct a road to Jeevlamari, some work is still remaining
 in donon sadakon ke nirmaan ke baad gramin ab zyada sankhya main madad maangane police tak pahunchane lage hai
 They realize that the road connects not only the villages or cities, but also the hearts

 When NDTV asked him if Prashant Kishore was present when he met KC Tyagi, Shivpal said, "I don't know Prashant Kishore who he is

 The comments haalanki aise gathjod kaa jo pehla sawaal he, uskaa jawaab dene se sabhi batch rahe hai- mukhyamantri koun hoga

 In such a situation, many more leaders including Nitish Kumar, Ajit Singh and HD Deve Gowda can join Mulayam on the same platform so far
 haalanki congress is manch par hogi yaa nahin, is par andeh he
 Neither Congress has been invited so far, nor is Shivpal willing to recognize Prashant Kishore, the current Congress strategist in UP

 tippaniyan However, everyone is avoiding answering the first question of such alliance - who will be the chief minister
 na muddon par koi baat hui he
 After meeting Shivpal, when Ajit Singh was asked if Akhilesh Yadav would approve as the alliance's chief ministerial candidate, he said, "we and Shivpal will talk on this
" aapse is bare main kyon baat karen"
 Whereas Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary told NDTV, "there is talk of Mulayam Singh to Ajit Singh

 Not only this, how much others will trust Mulayam who left Nitish in Bihar
 haalanki congress is manch par hogi yaa nahin, is par andeh he
 Neither Congress has been invited so far, nor is Shivpal willing to recognize Prashant Kishore, the current Congress strategist in UP
 jab enditivi ne unase poocha ki kya kasee tyaagi se mulaakaat ke dauraan prashanth kishor vahaan maujuud the, shivpal ne kaha, "main prashanth kishor ko nahin jaanata ki wo koun hai
 
 
 i had gone to invite "
 tippaniyan However, everyone is avoiding answering the first question of such alliance - who will be the chief minister
 na muddon par koi baat hui he
 After meeting Shivpal, when Ajit Singh was asked if Akhilesh Yadav would approve as the alliance's chief ministerial candidate, he said, "we and Shivpal will talk on this
" aapse is bare main kyon baat karen"
 Whereas Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary told NDTV, "there is talk of Mulayam Singh to Ajit Singh
 baatcheet acchhee chal rahi he
 But issues or seats have not been discussed yet
 
 
 gathjod abhi dur he"
 But there are questions beyond this
 congress or bispi se alag ye morcha kitna kaamyaab hoga- khaaskar tab jab samaajawaadee party kii kaman or disha ko lekar bheetar hi ghamaasan jari he
 Not only this, how much others will trust Mulayam who left Nitish in Bihar
 haalanki aise gathjod kaa jo pehla sawaal he, uskaa jawaab dene se sabhi batch rahe hai- mukhyamantri koun hoga
 There has been no talk on issues
 shivpal se mulaakaat ke baad jab ajit singh se poocha gaya ki kya gathjod ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par akhilesh yadav unhen manzur honge, to unhone kaha, "is par ham or shivpal baat karenge
 Why talk to you about it "
 jabaki ajit singh ke bete jayant choudhary ne enditivi se kaha, "mulaayam singh se ajit singh kii baat hui he
 The conversation is going well
 lekin muddon par yaa siton par abhi baat nahin hui he
 
 
 The alliance is far away "
 lekin is baat ke aage bhi sawaal hai
 Unlike the Congress and BSP, how successful will this front be - especially when there is fierce fighting within the Samajwadi Party's command and direction
 yahi nahin, jin mulaayam ne bihar main nitish kaa saath choda, un par duusare kitna bharosa karenge
 But there are questions beyond this
 congress or bispi se alag ye morcha kitna kaamyaab hoga- khaaskar tab jab samaajawaadee party kii kaman or disha ko lekar bheetar hi ghamaasan jari he

 RBI or CBI ke baad ab ek or badi sanstha ne modi sarkaar par ishaaron main sawaal uthaa die hai
 Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said that we had received an RTI in relation to intentionally handing over the list of defaulters who did not repay the loan
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baavjood arabiai ne ye suchi saarvajanik nahin kii
 Earlier, one such RTI was also put up, in which the Information Commissioner ordered the name to be revealed
 ek din pehle hi siaisi ne jaanboojhkar bank karj nahin chukaane waalon kii suchi kaa khulaasa karne sambandhi supreme court ke faisle kaa paalan nahin karne ke liye arabiai governor urjit patel ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya tha
 The CIC has also asked the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make public the letter of former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on the debt owed
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baavjood 50 karod rupee or usase adhik kaa lone lene or jaanboojhkar use nahin chukaane waalon ke naam ke sambandh main soochna arabiai dwaara nahin uplabdh karaane ko lekar naaraaz siaisi ne patel se yah bataane ke liye kaha tha ki faisle kaa paalan nahin nahin karne ko lekar un par kyon na adhiktam jurmaana lagaaya jaae
 The Supreme Court upheld the then information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi's decision to disclose the names of those who did not pay the loan intentionally
 siaisi ne yaad dilaayaa ki patel ne 20 sitambar ko sivisi main kaha tha ki satarkta par sivisi kii ore se jari disha-nirdesh kaa uddeshy adhik paardarshita, saarvajanik jivan main eemaandaaree or satyanishtha kii samskruti ko badhaava dena tathaa uske adhikaar kshetra main aane vaale sanghathanon main samgr satarkta prashasan ko behatar bananaa he
 Information Commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said that the Commission believes that there is no mismatch between what the RBI Governor and Deputy Governor say about the RTI policy and what their website says
 jayanti laal maamle main siaisi ke aadesh kii ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara pushti kiye jane ke baavjood satarkta reporton or nirikshan reporton main atyadhik gopneeyata rakhi ja rahi he

 akhilesh yadav kaa mulaayam singh yadav ko party adhyaksh pad se hataanaa bhartiya raajnneeti ke sabase naatakeey kisson main gina jayega
 Akhilesh became the political heir of his father and left him ahead
 akhilesh ke rukh se saaf he ki is baar wo samjhauta karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 The Election Commission has announced elections in five states including UP
 akhilesh ko acchhee tarah pataa tha ki janvari tak chunaav ghoshit ho jaaenge or chunaav aachaar samhita lekar aaenge, jiske baad wo na to laptop baant paaenge or na metro kaa feeta kaat paaenge
 All these works were done by Akhilesh in December itself
 alam ye tha ki akele 20 disambar ko unhone 5 ghante main 51 hajaar karod rupye kii 51 pariyojnaon kaa shilanyas or udghaatan kiya
 All these schemes of the SP government can play an important role in wooing the voters in the forthcoming elections, but the figures seem to be telling something else
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa vaale din akhilesh ne hindi-angreji ke lagbhag sabhi akhabaaron main puure panne kaa ek vigyaapan diya or apni uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan kiya
 In which it is written that if the intention is true then everything can happen
 lekin agar akhilesh ke vigyapanon kaa vishleshan karen to sach kuch or najar aata he
 Regarding the Samajwadi Yuva Rozgar Yojana, the government has claimed through advertisements that between 2012 and 2016, they have given benefits of this scheme to 1,35,228 people
 iske liye unhone 180 lakh rupye kaa bajet nikaala tha
 Now the viewer at one time may feel that because of Akhilesh government, the budget of 180 lakh was spent for the betterment of the public and about one and a half lakh people will benefit from it
 lekin thodaa ganit lagaaya jaae to pataa kuch or chalata he
 When 180 lakh rupees will be distributed among 1,35,228 people of UP, then only 133 in each share
 10 rupye, rupye hi hota he
 On top of this, between 2007-12 only 33 lakh rupees were distributed
 51,652 logon main
 He gave six times the money to three times the people
 2007 se 2012 ke bich ke aankade bataate hai ki is yojana ke tahat labhaarthiyon ko mahaj 63
 88 rupees received
 yakindhkhileshke aankade behatar hai
 But, in such a way, the government, which has given compensation of 20 rupees instead of 10 rupees, can also say that it increased the compensation by 100 percent
 lekin isse logon kaa kuch bhala hoga kya
 This has been happening since the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh
 yojanaon ke naam par logon ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 Akhilesh is awake, but after a crushing defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 wo chunaav unke liye kisi bure sapane se kam nahin he, jise wo kabhi yaad nahin rakhana chahenge
 Yet there was no improvement in the fate of UP
 kairana, mujffarnagar danga, bulandshahr hive gangrape, akhlaaq hatyakand ye sab upi ne akhilesh kaarykaal main hi dekha he
 The government has the deadline of Goods and Services Tax i

 GST in April 2017 and the government will have to work hard to implement it
 bharat ke sabase bade tex sudhaar kahe ja rahe jiesti ko buudhvaar ko rajyasabha ne paas kar diya
 It is being described as the biggest victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since coming to power
 ab loksabhaa main iske paas hone kaa rasta aasaan ho gaya he kyonki sarkaar vahaan bahumat main he
 After that GST is required to be passed by at least 15 of the 29 states in the country
 sarkaar chaahati he ki yah kaam agle 30 dinon ke bheetar puraa ho jaae
 Although Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does not have a cordial relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that he is willing to do what he can for his side for GST
 bihar vidhansabha kaa monsoon satr guuruuvaar ko samaapt ho chukaa he lekin nitish kumaar ne vitt mantri arun jetali ko phone kar prastaav diya ki jiesti ko paas karne ke liye vah sadan kaa vishesh satr bhi bula sakate hai
 The Chief Minister had earlier said that with the implementation of GST, Bihar's revenue will increase by about Rs 8000 crore every year
 sansad or uske baad rajya jise paarit karne kii prakriya main hai vah ek samvidhan sanshodhan he jo sarkaar ko nai kar shakti pradaan karegaa
 Later a new law regarding the new rate and scale of GST will be sent for a separate review

 haalanki sarkaar ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ne 18 fisadi kii dar kaa suzav diya he lekin vitt mantralay ke sutron kaa kahana he isaki dar isse zyada ho sakati he
 The main opposition Congress has said that if the GST rate is more than 18 percent then it will oppose it
 tippaniyan Since GST is applicable to consumption, the states producing the things have been assured to recover the loss due to the Center by 5 years
 visheshgy kah rahe hai ki ek nae iti system ko sthapit karnaa, hajaaron tex karmiyon ko prashikshan dena or companiyon ko hone vaale badlaavon ke bare main bataanaa jiesti ko samay par lagu karne kii raah main sabase badi chunauti sabit honge
 The GST, which is being called India's biggest tax reform, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 ise satta main aane ke baad se pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sabase badi jeet bataaya ja rahaa he
 Now in the Lok Sabha it has become easier to pass because the government is in majority there
 uske baad jiesti ko desh ke 29 rajyon main se kam se kam 15 rajyon se paarit hona aavashyak he
 The government wants this work to be completed within the next 30 days
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke vaise to pradhanmantri narendra modi se madhur sambandh nahin hai, lekin unhone kaha ki ve apni taraf se jo kar sakate hai, jiesti ke liye vah karne ko taiyaar hai
 The monsoon session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly ended on Thursday but Nitish Kumar telephoned Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to propose that he can also call a special session of the House to pass the GST
 mukhyamantri ne pehle kaha tha ki jiesti lagu hone se bihar ke rajasav main har saal kareeb 8000 karod rupee kaa ijapha hoga
 The Parliament and then the states which are in the process of passing it is a constitutional amendment which will give new tax power to the government
 baad main jiesti kii nai dar or uske paimaane ko lekar nayaa kanoon alag se rivyuu ke liye bheja jayega
 State governments are broadly supporting GST as it would increase their share of central taxes and make intra-state trade more accessible
 rajyon ke pratinidhi jiesti kii dar tay karne ke liye vitt mantri ke saath sahyog karenge
 Though the Chief Economic Advisor to the government has suggested a rate of 18 per cent, sources in the finance ministry say the rate may be higher
 mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne kaha he ki agar jiesti kii dar 18 fisadi se adhik hoti he to vah iskaa virodh karegi
 The comments chunki jiesti khapat par lagu hota he, isliye chizon kaa utpaadan karne vaale rajyon ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai 5 saal tak centre dwaara kiye jane kaa bharosa diya gaya he
 Experts are saying that setting up a new IT system, training thousands of tax personnel and informing companies about the changes will prove to be the biggest challenge in the way of timely implementation of GST

 About 20 countries signed the Solar Alliance on Tuesday in the ongoing climate change conference in Morocco, which has been talked about continuously for the last one year
 lekin is saura alliance kii shuruyaat feeki hi rahi kyonki isamen abhi bharat or brazil ke alaava keval ek hi ek bada desh he or vah he france jo pichley saal is solar alliance kii neenv daalane main bharat kaa sahabhaagi tha
 Under the Solar Alliance, there is a need to create a joint organization of about 120 countries with good potential for solar energy
 ye desh purna rup se yaa aanshik rup se makar rekha or kark rekha ke bich padate hai jisaki vajah se yahaan saura urja kii acchhee sambhaavna he
 The purpose of Solar Alliance is to promote solar energy and through this, increase the demand for solar energy and reduce its price
 jalwaayu parivartan ke khatre or dharti ke badhate taapmaana ko dekhte hue yah alliance kargar ho saktaa he kyonki ye saura urja kii disha main krantikari vichaar he lekin is alliance ko lekar sabase badi phikr paise or technology kii he
 Some experts say that no fund has been prepared for the Solar Alliance, nor is it clear how the Solar Alliance will achieve its objective
 tippaniyan Big countries like China and Germany are not yet part of it and the US has refused to join it, after which there are many doubts about the future of this alliance
 jaankaron ke mutabik jab tak bade vikasshil desh iskaa hissaa nahin banenge tab tak paise or finance kii dikkat bani rahegi kyonki bahut saare garib desh to is alliance main sirf madad kii aas lekar aa rahe hai
 Environment Minister Anil Dave said in a conversation with NDTV India in Morocco, "we need technology as well as research which will require money but we have started and the path will go on its own
 finance ko lekar bharat ne apni pahal kii he or sasti acchhee or prabhavi technology laane kii koshish karenge
 " solar alliance ke tahat saura urja kii acchhee sambhaavna vaale kareeb 120 deshon ke ek saajha sanghathan banane kii baat he
 These countries lie completely or partially between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer, due to which there is a good possibility of solar energy
 solar alliance kaa makasad saura urja ko badhaava dena or uske zariye solar energy kii maang badhaakar isaki keemat ko kam karnaa he
 Given the threat of climate change and the rising temperature of the earth, this alliance can be effective because it is a revolutionary idea towards solar energy, but the biggest concern about this alliance is money and technology
 kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki solar alliance ke liye abhi na to koi fund taiyaar hua he or na hi ye spasht he ki solar alliance apane makasad ko kaise hasil karegaa
 The comments china or germany jaise bade desh abhi iskaa hissaa nahin bane hai or america ne to isamen shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya he jiske baad is alliance ke bhavishya ko lekar bhi kai shankaaen hai
 According to experts, until the big developing countries do not become part of it, then there will be a problem of money and finance, because many poor countries are only waiting for help in this alliance
 paryaavaran mantri anil dave ne morocco main enditivi india se baatcheet main kaha,"hamen technology bhi chaiye or research bhi kerani hogi jiske liye paise kii zarurat hogi lekin ham chal pade hai or rasta apane aap banataa chalaa jaayegaa
 India has taken its initiative regarding finance and will try to bring cheap good and effective technology

 The cabinet of the new government is breathless
 ummid he, sarkaar aage niraash nahin karegi
 On the very next day of the swearing in of the Modi government, this remark by international investment firm Credit Suisse was taken aback
 nishkarsh tathysangat tha lekin tippanee kuch jaldbaaji main kii gai lagati thi
 However, last week, a big foreign investor asked me in a twisted way what is Plan b of the Modi government? So i am not surprised because from the political to the corporate corridors, the question has started to get confused whether the time has come for Narendra Modi to do a big surgery of his government
 yah sawaal keval sarkaar ke kamjor pradarshan se hi prerit nahin he
 An echo of sushma-vasundhara's love for Lalit, Smriti Irani's controversy over the idolatry and modi-shah's Iqbal on the government and the party can also be heard in this question
 modi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone tak yah sach lagbhag pach gaya tha ki apekshaaon va manshaa ke mukaable nattejey kamjor rahe hai
 But no one feared that the new government would be embroiled in controversies that could not only swallow the enthusiasm of governance but also the Narendra Modi and Amit Shah dominance in the government and BJP, without realizing any tangible changes
 Will be at stake pichley ek saal main modi sarkaar ke do chehre dikhe hai
 One face is grand and spectacular events and effective dialogue strategies
 lekin iske vipareet doosraa cheharaa gavarnence main thos yathasthiti kaa he jo pigal nahin saki
 This stay is also disturbing the Prime Minister himself
 sarkaar kii is bechaini ko tathyon main baandha ja saktaa he
 Take, for example, a bureaucratic reshuffle
 pichley 12 maah main centre kii naukarshahi main teen bade pherbadal ho chuke hai
 This arrogance is a travesty of confusion in running the government
 modi sarkaar beuroperesi ko sthir or swatantra bananaa chaahati he jabaki tabadatod pherbadal ne ulataa hi asar kiya he
 Similarly, due to the challenges of implementation, the targets and provisions of all major announcements have been changed
 agar van rank van pension, khaadya mahangaai, ucch padon par paardarshita jaise bade chunavi vaadon par kirakiri ko isamen jod liya jaae to mahasoos karnaa mushkil nahin he ki dhalaan saamne he or vaapasi ke liye sarkaar kii surat va sirat main saahsee badlaav karne honge, kyonki abhi chaar saal gujaarne hai
 Narendra Modi can no longer proceed without surgery of his government
 mantrimandal ke pehle punargathan tak yah baat saaf ho gai thi ki tajurbe va peshewar logon kii kami ke kaaran team modi apekshaaon ke mukaable behad lachar he
 The report card of the last one year proves that most ministers have not been able to leave any impact
 vajah chaahe mantriyon kii aakshamata ho yaa unhen adhikaar na milanaa, lekin modi kaa mantrimandal unki manshaaon ko jameen par utaarne main naakaam rahaa he
 The vacant top posts in important institutions show that even after a year, the size of the government has not been completed
 agar modi agle teen maah main apane mantrimandal main akarmanyata kaa boj kam nahin karte to niti shoonyata or kamjor gavarnence kii tohamatein unka intjaar kar rahi hai
 Modi may be known for not listening to the advice, but now he needs think tanks and advisors ranging from economy, foreign policy to his speeches that can give the government a new understanding of policies, programs and laws
 nai packaging main upie kii skiimon ke doharaav ke kaaran bade-bade mishan chote nattejey bhi nahin de paa rahe hai or asafalataaen badaae lagi hai
 The Modi government also needs sensible changes in the implementation structure for which it has to rely on the understanding of professionals as it happens in other countries of the world
 narendra modi apni sarkaar or party main naitikta va paardarshita ke oonche mandandon se samjhaute kaa jokhim nahin le sakate, kyonki unki sarkaar ko mili janadesh kii prishthbhumi alag he
 The cases of Vasundhara, Sushma, Smriti, Pankaja are more crucial to Modi's politics than BJP
 in maamalon ne modi ko dohari chot pahunchaai he
 One, his clean government has now become tainted
 doosraa, pad na chhodie par ade netaa modi-shah ke niyantran ko chunauti de rahe hai
 Modi's challenges in terms of governance and transparency are bigger than Manmohan's
 manmohan ke daur main bhrashtachar va niti shoonyata kii tohamatein gathbandhan kii majaburiyon par madhi ja sakati thim
 This was the reason that a large part of the stigma of the UPA government went to the Congress Party's account
 alabatta bijepi main to sarkaar or party donon modi main hi samahit hai or unki apni hi party ke netaa daagi ho rahe hai
 Therefore, all the gifts will be recorded only in Modi's account
 musiibat yah he ki nai sarkaar ke kai myth achaanak ek saath tuutane lage hai
 Contrary to the legend of Modi's tight grip on ministers and chief ministers, senior ministers and chief ministers appear to be tainted, while the absence of concrete results is disappointing people despite the tremendous strategies of mass dialogue
 sarkaar ek saal ke bheetar hi film set kii tarah dikhne lagi he jisamen baahar bhavyata he lekin peeche upie jaisi apaardarshita or niti shoonyata bajbaja rahi he
 The manner in which Modi emerged in the national politics of BJP and won elections, the success of his political success is in the success of his governance
 yadi sarkaar asafal yaa daagi hui to party par unke ikbaal kaa pani bhi tikaoo sabit nahin hoga
 There is growing anxiety about the government, but the trust is still intact
 narendra modi ko kuch do took hi karnaa hoga, unke liye bich kaa koi rasta nahin he
 If there is a delay in the bold changes in the government and the party, then for the next four years, Modi will be forced to run a defensive government that will lose its face in the face of opposition attacks
 yakeenan, narendra modi ek kamjor va lizliji sarkaar kaa netritv kabhi nahin karnaa chahenge
 Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has said that the Akhilesh government of UP was warned by the ministry

 At the same time, 21 per cent of the voters reported it as average
 dilli ke logon ke liye sabase bada muddasrvey main dilli ke logon ne naala, naalee or saaf-safai ko sabase bada mudda bataaya
 This can be a big reason for this, because Delhi has an AAP government and the BJP is in control of all three mcds

 Ashutosh said, 'there are four things in favor of AAP - electricity, water, education and health

 Electricity and water have certainly satisfied a large section of the population living below the poverty line

 On the other hand, election analyst Yogendra Yadavathodi has a different opinion
 unke mutabik AAP sarkaar simit str par hi safal rahi he, lekin ise kisi asli vipakshi chunauti kaa saamana nahin he
 Yadav said, 'I would say that it is limited and a little bit successful

 On Tuesday, a hearing was held in the Supreme Court on Section 377 which brings homosexuality under the offense
 is maamle kii sunwaayee buudhvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 On Tuesday, the arguments of the lawyers of the petitioners seeking to declare homosexuality as guilt-free were heard
 is maamle kii sunwaayee supreme court kii sanvaidhanik peeth kar rahi he
 The five judges of the bench include Chief Justice Deepak Mishra besides four more judges, including RF Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra
 desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne somvaar ko is maamle kii sunwaayee main deree se inkaar kar diya tha
 The central government wanted that the case should be heard after at least four weeks
 padhie, supreme court main hui sunwaayee ke apadet-- arvind daataar ne kaha ki samalangikta beemaari nahin he
 Both sexual attitudes and sexual identities are equally facts of one's natural instinct
 - arvind daataar ne kaha ki agar kisi vyakti kaa yon rujhaan alag he to ise aparaadh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 This cannot be called against nature
 - arvind daataar ne adaalat se kaha- agar yah kanoon aaj lagu kiya jaataa to yah sanvaidhanik taur par sahi nahin hota
 On this, the court said to them- Please assure us that if such a law is made today, it will not be permanent
 - bench main iklauti jaj indu malhotra ne kaha ki samalangikta keval purushon main hi nahin jaanwaron main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 She was commenting on Datar's homosexuality as normal and non-violent and a form of human sexuality
 - yachikakartaon kii ore se arvind daataar ne kaha ki 1860 kaa samalangikta kaa code bharat par thopa gaya tha
 It also did not represent the will of the then British Parliament
 - mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ne tippanee kii ki yah maamla keval dhara 377 kii vaidhata se judaa hua he
 It has nothing to do with marriage or other civil rights
 vah bahes duusari he
 - Tushar Mehta said that this case should be limited to Section 377
 iskaa uttaradhikaar, shaadi or sambhog ke maamalon par koi asar nahin padana chahie
 - Tusshar Mehta is appearing for the central government
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar is par aaj apana paksh rakhegi
 On this, Rohatgi said - Yes
 british upniveshvaadiyon ke 1860 ke naitik mulyon se prakritik sex ko paribhaashit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The morality of ancient India was different from that of Victorian morality
 - justise nariman ne rohtagi se poocha ki kya yah unka tark he ki samalangikta prakritik hoti he?- rohtagi ne mahabharat ke shikhandi or ardhanarishwar kaa bhi udhaaharan diya ki kaise dhara 377 yon naitikta kii galat tarah se vyakhya karti he
 - Rohatgi said - Section 377 violates human rights
 samaaj ke badalane ke saath hi naitiktaayen badal jaati hai
 We can say that 160 years old moral values will not be today's moral values
 - rohtagi bole- dhara 377 'prakritik' yon sambandh ke bare main baat karti he
 Homosexuality is also natural, it is not unnatural
 - rohtagi ne kaha- pashchimi duniya main is vishay par shodh hue hai
 Such sexual instincts have hereditary reasons
 - rohtagi ne kaha- is cese main gender se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The case of sexual instinct is also different from choice
 yah prakritik hoti he
 It comes into being as a human being
 - mukul rohtagi bole- yon rujhaan or ling (gender) alag-alag chijen hai
 This case is related to sexual orientation
 - rohtagi kaa tark- dhara 377 ke hone se algebiti samudaay apane aap ko aghoshit apradhi mahasoos karata he
 Society also looks at them differently
 inhen sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon se surakshit mahasoos karnaa chahie
 - Rohatgi is arguing against Section 377

 - centre sarkaar kii ore se adishnal solicytor general tushaar mehta pesh hue hai
 The appeal of the Center was rejected
 Earlier, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra turned down the Central Government's request to defer the hearing
 justise mishra ne kaha ki sunwaayee taali nahin jaaegi
 The Center had said in the Supreme Court that in this case the government has to file an affidavit which may be important in this case
 isse pehle, chif justise deepak mishra kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 377 ko barkaraar rakhane vaale apane pehle ke aadesh par punarvichaar karne kaa nirnay liya tha
 Justices Mishra had said, 'our earlier order needs to be reconsidered
 ' adaalat ne yah aadesh iaiti ke kareeb 20 purv or maujuuda chaatro, enjio naaj foundation or algebiti rhite activiston kii yachikaaon par diya tha
 These petitions have stated that Section 377 of the IPC is a violation of Article 21 (right to Live) and Article 14 (right to Equality) of the Constitution
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ne 2013 main apane ek aadesh main dilli hoicourt kesamalangikta ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baharakarne ke faisle ko palat diya tha
 The Delhi High Court gave this ruling in 2009

 In January this year, the Supreme Court had accepted a petition for reconsideration of its old decision
 is dauraan court ne tippanee kii thi ki apni pasand ko apnaane vaale logon ke man main koi dar nahin hona chahie
 Along with this, the court had also accepted that 'the work that is natural to one may not be natural to another because social morality varies from time to time

 'significantly, in December last year, the government brought an ordinance, making changes in the land law
 in badlaavon main paanch kshetron-audyogic coridor, pipipi projects, gramin avasanrachana, kifayati awaas or raksha ke liye sahmati kii shart ko bhi hataa diya gaya tha
 Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's advice to bjp's staunch leaders to keep quiet, some party leaders are uncontested
 aise hi hai karnataka ke belgavi (gramin) se bijepi vidhayak sanjay patil
 An FIR has been filed against Patil on a controversial statement recently
 is bayaan main unhone kaha tha ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav sadak or pani ke mudde par nahin balki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich ho rahaa he
 Patil has now said that the statement he is not refusing from it belongs to him but the context in which he said it was not presented in the same way
 yani patil ne yahi kahana chaha ki unke bayaan ko tod- marod kar pesh kiya gaya he
 Patil said on Monday, 'there is a Muslim who shouts slogans of Pakistan Zindabad
 koi to musalmaan he jo cricket match main pakistan ke jeetne par pataakhe phodta he
 There is someone who walks around with the flag of Pakistan in hand
 hindustan main use hi to dhundhna he
 Patil demonstrated strength through road shows before filing nominations for the assembly elections
 safa pahane unke samarthakon ne haathon mentirange or bhagava jhande thamehue the
 Patil himself rode the chariot
 unhone rath par hi ‘ajtak’ samvaadadaata se khaas baat kii
 Patil further clarified his point saying, 'it is not only road and sewer development, it is also the responsibility of the leaders to protect religion and culture
 hindu banaam muslim (chunaav) nahin ho saktaa lekin agar koi musalmaan hindustan ke khilaaf kaam karata he to use rokna hamaara ferj he
 According to the reports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday addressed the mps and mlas of the Namo App Parbajp and warned them to exercise restraint in speaking and to let the spokespersons in the party who have the responsibility to speak
 pradhanmantri ne saath hi kaha tha ki apni galatiyon ke liye media ko jimmedaar naa tehraaen, kyonki ye galtiyaan hi media ko masala detii hai
 Patil told 'aaj Tak' that the Karnataka assembly election will be on the issue of protecting religion and culture along with development
 patil ke mutabik chunaav main vikaas, naukari jaise mudde to rahenge hi lekin sabase pehle desh kaa mudda hona chahie
 Only then the country will develop
 patil ne puure tevar ke saath kaha, ‘bharat mata kii jai or vande maataram kehane main kyon shame aati he wo bhi agar khate yaheen par hai pite yaheen par hai
 Whoever will be Hindu, will be Hindustani, Bharat will love mother, he will sing praise of Mother India
 ’patil ke mutabik unke kathith bayaan ko lekar jo video aayaa wo kaaryakartaaon ke saath ho rahi baatcheet kaa tha
 Patil also questioned that his statement is that if a Ram temple should be built in India, what is wrong with it, if there is no Ram temple in India, then where will it be built in Pakistan
 patil ne kaha, ‘maamla kisi ek community ko target karne kaa nahin he, isiilie maine kaha ki video ko tod marod kar pesh kiya gaya
 Patil also accused Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of dividing the Lingayat community
 patil ne kaha, jo lingayat samaaj hajaaron saal se bhai chaare ke saath rah rahaa he unako tod diya
 If the demand for Lingayat is of a different identity, then why did the Congress government remember this at the time of the elections
 rajya main congress kii sarkaar bane 5 saal ho gaye, pehle kyon nahin yaad aayaa
 Patil said that the people of Karnataka know everything, wait till May 15, the public will tell with whom the Lingayats are with
 patil ke mutabik karnataka kii ek sachai he ki devgauda ko vokaliga kaa netaa mana jaataa he
 Yeddyurappa is considered the leader of the Lingayat society in the same way as Siddaramaiah, the leader of the Kurbar society
 patil ne siddharmaiya kii shuru kii gai shaadi bhagya yojana par bhi bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya
 Patil said that whether this scheme is only for Muslims, in any other society, people of any other religion, there are no poor people? Patil left no stone unturned in praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but also said that in Karnataka They consider it their duty to bring forth what is going on
 pradhanmantri kii naseehat ko lekar patil ne kaha ki unka aadesh to hamaare liye bhagwaan kaa prasad he
 Refusing to accept his statement as controversial, Patil said, "you are saying this, i am telling the truth

 In the petition, youtube, Google, the central government and CBFC have been made party
 is yachika par dilli hai court main somvaar ko sunwaayee hogi
 Regarding the controversy over over 5 crore viewfilms received by the trailer of Accidental Prime Minister, Anupam Kher said, "it is ridiculous to say that people chose a political party because of Sanjay Baru's book and there was a change in the government
 isi tarah yah kahana bhi badi bachakaani baat he ki yah film is saal chunaav ke nattejey badal degi
 "explain that the film is directed by Vijay Ratnakar Gutte
 isamen akshay khanna sanjay baru ke role main hai
 Apart from this, Ahana Kumra and Arjun Mathur will appear in the film
 rape cese main sajaa kaat rahe ram rahim dwaara punjab-haryana hai court main daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke baad sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Along with this, the plea related to the demand of life imprisonment to Ram Rahim was accepted by both the sages
 vakil esake garg narwanaa ne bataaya ki hai court main ram rahim ko nirdosh bataaya gaya he
 According to the information, Ram Rahim, who is facing the charge of impotent 400 sadhus, is playing new bets to get out of jail
 beete 7 oktober ko ram rahim ne punjab-haryana hai court main yachika daayar kii thi
 In this, he told the court that after 1990 he himself became impotent
 isi par hai court main aaj sunwaayee hui he
 Aroparam Rahim, who had not conducted a potency test, had said in the petition that all the rape cases registered against him were fake
 uskaa sexual potency test nahin karavaaya gaya
 This proves that he cannot form a physical relationship
 usne donon sadhviyon ke 6 saal baad halafanama darj hone par sawaal uthaae hai
 There is also talk of not coming in front of a sadhvi writing anonymous letters
 court ne CBI ko jari kiya noticeram rahim ne court se guhaar lagaate hue sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke faisle ko nirast karne kii maang kii he
 He says that he is innocent in all these cases and he should be released soon
 hai court main repist baba ram rahim kii is yachika par somvaar ko sunwaayee hui, jise sweekaar karte hue court ne sibiai ko notice jari kiya
 On the other hand, on the other side, both the Sadhvi victims of rape also filed a petition in the haryana-punjab High Court
 unhone ram rahim ko hui 20 saal kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel karne kii maang kii he
 This petition has also been accepted by the court
 donon sadhviyon ke saamne aane ke baad ram rahim ke karname duniya ke saamne aae or iskaa khulaasa hua
 Let us assume that the special court of CBI has sentenced Ram Rahim to 20 years in the case of the rarest of the rare case
 court ne do sadhviyon se rape cese main alag-alag 10-10 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 Apart from this, a fine of Rs 15 lakh was also imposed in both the cases
 court ne ram rahim par sakht tippanee karte hue aparaadh ko reerest of di rer maanate hue sajaa di thi
 Physical and mental abuse was done by the CBI court, which said that girls who worshiped her like a god, have abused them
 aisa karke doshi ne unka vishwaas todaa he
 The victims have been physically and mentally abused
 peedita ram rahim ke sangrakshan main rahati thim
 This action was done with him there
 ye maamla castodial rape se kam prathit nahin ho rahaa he
 The case of the rare case was told by the CBI court judge Jagdeep Singh, in his judgment, while considering the charges against Ram Rahim, was very serious and said that he is not entitled to mercy
 court kaa maananaa tha, 'doshi ne khud ko bhagwaan ke rup main pesh kiya or apni takat kaa durupyog karte hue maasoom ladakiyon ke saath rape kiya
 This case falls under the category of rarest of the rare case
 ' The proceedings of both the Houses of Parliament were interrupted several times on Monday over the Constitution Amendment Bill providing for reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) during promotions, but eventually the Rajya Sabha passed the Bill

 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has said that our party can change the power in Maharashtra anytime in today's political climate
 partiyon kaa naam liye bagaiyr sanjay raut ne kaha ki shivasena ke saamne yah haal hi main bani hui partiyaan hai
 He said whether to establish power by uniting with unions parties like BJP? This question always remains in the mind of Shiv Sena, it is easy to form a government with the support of the parties against which the Shiv Sena had contested and fought
 lekin ye to janata se gaddari hogi ye hamen sochna padataa he
 With the election ready all the time, Sanjay Raut said with full force that if elections were to be held now, Shiv Sena would get majority and Shiv Sena would establish power on its own
 raut bole ke jo bol rahe he ye aatmavishvaas maharashtra kii janata ke man main bhi he or shivasena ko bhi bahumat hasil karne kaa utana hi aatmavishvaas he
 On the differences between the wrong policies and daily relations of the BJP, Raut said, 'even though in the Maharashtra government, the Shiv Sena keeps on giving the BJP the opposite hand every day, all the time, every time, hands and lots of bjp's wrong policies
 And the Shiv Sena is doing this only and only for the benefit of the farmers
 naded main haarana badi baathaal hi main nanded nagar nigam chunaav main bijepi kii karaari haar par kushi jaahir karte hue raut ne kaha ki nanded kii haar kaa kaaran bijepi sarkaar kii hukumshahi ke saath-saath unki asafal aarthik nitiyaan hai jo janata par thopi gayi
 Raut did not stop to say that it has happened many times that many power changes have started with the election of Nanded
 isiilie congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok chavaan ne jo kaha he ke bijepi kii ulti ginati shuru ho gayi he wo sahi he
 Raut was here to visit three assembly constituencies in Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune
 unhone shivasena kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithak kar party ke kaaryakramon kaa jayja bhi liya

 He said that the liar has lied again
 rajasthan ke alvar main kathith gorakshakon ke dwaara kii gai rakabar khan kii hatya kaa maamla ab tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 The case has resonated from Parliament to the country's largest court
 ab congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi is maamle main police ke gaiyr jimmedaarana ravaiye par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 On Monday, while tweeting about the matter, Rahul wrote that when the hospital is just 6 km from mouka-e-vardat
 kii duuri par hi tha to police ko rakabar ko vahaan le jane par 3 ghante kyon lage
 Rahul questioned that the policemen were enjoying tea on the way
 unhone kaha ki ye modi kaa krur new india he, jahaan maanavtaa kii jagah nafrat ne lee he or logon ko dabaaya ja rahaa he or unhen marane ke liye choda ja rahaa he
 What is the truth of the negligence of the police? According to the FIR and the news, about 12 to the police
 40 baje rakabar kii soochna mili
 But the police rushed Rakbar to the hospital at around 4 am
 sabase badi baat ghatnasthal se aspataal mahaj 6 kilometre tha
 In such a situation, how did the police take about 3-4 hours
 doctor kaa kahana he ki rakabar ko aspataal laane main deree hui or jab wo aspataal pahunchaa tab tak uski jaan ja chuki thi
 After all, how the police delayed Rakbar to reach the hospital, when the team of 'aaj Tak' investigated him, one of the shocking revelations came out
 laaparvaahee number-1aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki police rakabar ko aspataal le jane se pehle chaay kii chuskiyaan lene pahunchi
 If Rakbar's condition was serious, why did the police stop the car and drink tea on the way? laaparvaahee number-2aarope he ki police ne gaadi gandi naa ho iske liye pehle keechad main sane rakabar ko nahalaaya dhulaayaa
 Negligence number-3 is being told that before reaching Rakbar, the cows were taken to Gaushala at around one o'clock, while Rakbar continued to police
 kya he alvar maamla?aapako bataa den ki rajasthan ke alvar jile main mob linching main rakabar khan kii maut ke maamle main rajya police par kai gambhir aarope lage hai
 It is alleged that the police preferred to bring the recovered cows to Gaushala first instead of taking Rakbar to the hospital
 yahi nahin, police ne khud bhi rakabar kii pitayee kii
 Due to this, Rakbar was delayed for three hours to reach the hospital and he died
 ukt aaropon par alvar ke espi rajendra singh ne ajtak se kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch kii jaaegi

 What happened on August 18, 1945? Did Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's plane get into an accident in Formosa (now Taiwan) and Netaji was killed? Or did he survive and move to Serbia? Or was the 'plane crash' just a 'cover' to let them get out safely? These are some of the questions that have been haunting and haunting Indians, especially Bengalis, for 70 years
 lekin, rahasy he ki beparda hone kaa naam hi nahin letaa
 a section of Netaji's heirs (including his daughter Anita Faf) and some elderly warriors of the Indian National Army (INA) of Subhash Chandra Bose believe that Netaji died in a plane crash and their ashes are safe at the Renkoji Temple in Tokyo Is kept lekin, netaji ke parijan, prashansak, shodh karne vaale haadase kii is kahani se sahamat nahin hai
 And, the number of those who believe so is very large
 anita phalf 2013 main kolkata ai thim
 He had said, 'it would have been a fantastic homecoming for Netaji
 unki asthiyaan bharat laai jaatin or unhen yahaan ganga main pravaahit kiya jaataa
 ' netaji ke vanshaj or harvard vishvavidhyalay ke professor saugat roy bhi yahi maanate hai ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main hui thi
 He strongly cites the testimony of those who survived in this accident
 netaji ke maamle kii jaanch shahanvaj khan samiti (1956), ji
 D
 khosla samiti (1970) or em
 K
 mukherjee ayog (2006) ne kii
 Investigation was done, but no result was found
 shahanvaj khan samiti or ji
 D
 khosla samiti ne mana ki vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut hui thi, lekin mukherjee ayog ne is baat ko khaarij kar diya ki netaji kii maut kisi haadase main ho chuki he
 However, the government did not accept the Mukherjee Commission report
 is maamle main shodh karne vaale or lekhak anuj dhar mukherjee ayog ke nateezon se sahamat hai
 Dhar said, "in the letter sent to the Mukherjee Commission and also to me, the Taiwan authorities have said that there was no accident on August 18, 1945
 ' He said, 'there are many such confidential files, which will prove that the incident of the plane was deliberately spread by the Japanese and Netaji so that they could get a chance to leave Soviet Russia
 ' However, Lakshmi Sehgal, who was Netaji's associate, did not agree
 unka kahana tha ki vimaan haadasa or usamen netaji kii maut ek sachai he
 The record is not because the Japanese destroyed all documents to cover up their war crimes before they were defeated
 netaji ke vimaan haadase ke dastavej isi kii bhent chadh gaye
 Now there is a demand from Netaji's family members and their fans that the Central and West Bengal governments should make all the files related to this matter public
 isse saaf ho jayega ki vimaan haadase main marane vaala ek japani sainik ichiro okura tha, na ki netaji
 The comments netaji ke sahyogi karnal habiburrahaman ne shahanvaj samiti se kaha tha ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main hui thi
 It is said that Colonel Rahman was with Netaji at the last moment and survived the accident
 lekin haadase kii kahani se asahmat logon kaa kahana he ki karnal rahamaan ne sach nahin bolaa or unhone aisa netaji ke kehane par hi kiya
 Colonel Rahman was interrogated by Netaji's elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose
 sharat chandra bose ke pote chandra kumaar ne apane pita ameey nath ke hawaale se bataaya, 'sharat chandra bose ne ghanton karnal rahamaan se vimaan haadase ke bare main poochtacha kii thi or phir unki baat ko khaarij kar diya tha
 ' netaji ke vaarison kaa ek dhada (jisamen unki beti anita phalf bhi shaamil hai) or subhaashachandr bose kii indian neshnal army (iene) ke kuch bujurg yoddha maanate hai ki vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut hui thi or unki asthiyaan tokyo ke rankoji mandir main surakshit rakhi hui hai
 However, Netaji's family, fans and researchers do not agree with this story of the incident
 or, aisa maanane waalon kii sankhya bahut adhik he
 Anita Faf came to Kolkata in 2013
 unhone kaha tha, 'yah netaji ke liye shandaar ghar vaapasi hoti
 Their bones were brought to India and they were flown here into the Ganges
 ' Saugata Roy, a descendant of Netaji and a professor at Harvard University, also believes that Netaji died in a plane crash
 vah is haadase main jinda batch gaye logon kii gavaahi kaa purajor hawala dete hai
 Investigation of Netaji's case Shahnawaz Khan Committee (1956), G
 di
 Khosla Committee (1970) and M
 ke
 Mukherjee Commission (2006)
 jaanch to hui, lekin nateeja nahin niklaa
 Shahnawaz Khan Committee and G
 di
 The Khosla Committee admitted that Netaji had died in the plane crash, but the Mukherjee Commission rejected that Netaji had died in an accident
 haalanki sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report sweekaar nahin kii
 Anuj Dhar Mukherjee, an author and researcher in this case, agrees with the Commission's results
 dhar ne kaha, 'mukherjee ayog ko or mujhe bhi bheje gaye patr main taiwan ke adhikariyon ne yahi kaha he ki 18 agast, 1945 ko koi haadasa nahin hua tha
 ' unhone kaha, 'aisi kai gopneey filein hai, jo sabit kar dengi ki vimaan haadase kii baat japaniyon or netaji ne jaan boojhkar failaai thi taaki unhen soviet rus nikal jane kaa mauka mil sake
 ' lekin, netaji kii sahyogi rah chukin lakshmi sahagal isse sahamat nahin thim
 He said that the plane crash and Netaji's death in it is a fact
 iskaa record isliye nahin he, kyonki haarane se pehle japaniyon ne apane yuddh aparaadhon par pardaa daalane ke liye sabhi dastavej nasht kar die the
 Documents of Netaji's plane crash went to him
 ab netaji ke gharavaalon or unke chaahane waalon kii maang he ki centre or pashchim bengal sarkaar is maamle se judi sabhi filon ko saarvajanik kare

 In a special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adopted in Monaco, the world has been cautioned to take some immediate steps
 iske mutabik samudr or prithvi par barf se jame ilaakon (cryosphere) main jo abhootpurv badlaav aae hai, un par praathamikta se gaur karne kii jarurat he
 For this, the world should unite and take action in a timely manner

 Glacier ice is melting
 isse jameen khisakane, barfile tufaan, chattan girane, baadh jaisi aapadaaon kaa khatra pehle kii tulana main kahin adhik bad gaya he

 According to the report, these changes in the eco system will increase the risk of flooding
 samudr or thande ilaakon kii sanrachana badalane se kuch dweepiya deshon main insaan kaa rahanaa mushkil ho jayega
 Tropical cyclonic winds, rain, increase in the speed of release of greenhouse gases will also increase sea level rise and the hazards associated with coastal areas

 Mixing of water surfaces has reduced due to the warming of the ocean

 She has been out of power in Assam and Kerala, and in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, her condition has become worse than before
 congress kii itani badi haar kii 4 ahm vajahen -1
 Despite the alliance in the 140 seats of anti-incumbency in Kerala and Assam, the Congress was ahead in 23 seats till noon
 vahiin assam kii 126 siton main se 23 siton par uski badhat darj kii gai
 He lost government in both states
 kerala mencongress gathbandhanane vam dalon se sarkaar chhini thi
 Opponents continued to agitate against the style of Oman Chandy
 vahiin assam main 15 saal tak mukhyamantri rahe tarun gogoi bhi vikaas kaaryon ke sawaal par ghire rahe
 The anti-government atmosphere at both places played a role in ousting him from power
 2
 Crisis of trust due to blindfolding from the Left parties led the Congress to contest elections against the Keralites and with the Left Front in West Bengal despite the alliance
 cader aadhaarit vam dalon main congress ke is ravaie se bharosa nahin ban paaya
 This love and hate relationship between the Congress and the Communists did not bring color
 yahi vajah rahi ki congress kerala main sarkaar se gai or pashchim bengal kii 294 siton main gathbandhan ke baavjood 40 siton ke aasapaas hi badhat banaati dikhti rahi

 kendriya or sthaneey netritv ke samanvay main kamijab rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav chal rahe the tab congress kaa kendriya netritv duusari vajahon main ulajhaa hua tha
 At the time of preparation, the central leadership was taking time to politicize the National Herald case, the agustawestland Chopper Deal Scam during the elections and earlier anti-national slogans at JNU and Rohit Vemula's suicide at Hyderabad Central University
 duusari ore, congress kaa rajya netritv prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan in aaropon kii bhi safai dene main vakt jaaya kar rahaa tha
 In Rahul Gandhi's frequent visits, instead of the local issue, the attack on the central government and cleaning itself was dominant

 sonia-rahul could not respond to modi-shah's strategy, be it a matter of alliance with regional parties or aggressive style of campaigning
 Congress high command Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi did not have the answer to bjp's strategy of kemodi-shah
 assam main bijepi ke uthaae muddon par congress adhiktar chup rahi
 At the same time, the Congress was also entangled due to strong satraps in other states, targeting Modi and BJP
 tamilnadu kii kul 232 siton main karunanidhi kii party diemke ke saath milakar bhi congress dahaai seat tak par badhat nahin bana pai
 Even if different parties win in four states, all are non-congress in political views
 isecongress virdohi laharke taur par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Its strategists are also considered to be the pairing of PM Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri ve narayansami ne kaha ki sarkaar kendriya mantriyon ke khilaaf lagaaye gayi team anna ke aaropon ko gambhirtha se nahin legi
 Narayanasamy told reporters after coming here from Delhi that i do not want to make any personal comments about him but we do not take him seriously

 The government rejected this demand
 narayansami ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne mukherjee kii ummidavaari par sabhi dalon se sahyog karne ko kaha he
 He hoped that Mukherjee would be elected unopposed
 isse purv jahajrani mantri ji ke vaasan ne kaha tha ki sarkaar is tarah ke aaropon ko adhik mahatv nahin detii
 We do not give much importance to baseless allegations
 team anna ke sadsy aravind kejariwal ne jodhpur main kaha tha ki mukherjee sheersh sanvaidhanik pad ke liye ummidavaar the tathaa is pad par baithne vaala vyakti bedaag hona chahie
 BJP national president Amit Shah also publicly thanked Nitish Kumar for giving strong support at a time when around 15 opposition parties have united against the government on the issue of demonetisation
 donon pakshon ke bich is tarah ke sauhardpurn bartaav kii vajah se galatchhemiyaan bhi paidaa huin, or ve itani bad gayi ki nitish kumaar ko rajya sarkaar main apane sahyogi rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke vidhayakon ko sambodhit kar spasht karnaa padaa ki bijepi ke saath dobaaraa meljol kii koi sambhaavna nahin ban rahi he
 The comments guuruuvaar ko hi nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) ne bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chetaya tha ki notebandi ke mudde par die gaye samarthan kii 'expyri date' bhi he
 Senior party leader Pawan Verma had said that now we are also seeing the problems being faced by the public, and will review the support after December 30, seeing the impact of demonetisation
 
 
 unhone kaha tha, "ham dekhenge ki jis lakshya ko saamne rakhkar yah kadam uthaaya gaya tha, kya yah uske kaam aayaa
 
 
 ? " so, shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri kii tippanee ke baad philhal yah nahin lag rahaa he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ko apane rukh ke bare main punarvichaar karne kii koi zarurat he
 
 
 On Thursday, Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal United (JDU) also warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is also an 'expiry date' of support given on the issue of demonetisation
 party ke varisht netaa pawan verma ne kaha tha ki ab ham janata ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ko bhi dekh rahe hai, or 30 disambar ke baad notebandi kaa prabhaav dekhakar samarthan kii samiksha karenge
 
 
 He had said, "we will see if the goal that was taken in front of it, did it work for it
" 
 
 ?" So, after the Prime Minister's remarks on Friday, it does not seem that the Chief Minister of Bihar needs to reconsider his stand
 
 
 so, shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri kii tippanee ke baad philhal yah nahin lag rahaa he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ko apane rukh ke bare main punarvichaar karne kii koi zarurat he

 Krishna, for whom writing like music has become a subject of discipline, says, "I think that writing expanded as my dialogue with life

 ve apni simaaon ke vistaar kaa prayaas kaise karte hai? ve bataate hai, ''main 'simaaon ko badhaane' jaisi baat ko hi nahin maanata kyonki isse lagata he ki yah aatmahin he
 Does this mean that i sing rare ragas, perform complex compositions, perform arithmetic calculations, mesmerize the audience with the sensation on stage? i am not interested in any of these things
 isliye, shaayad main koi nai simaaen nahin tay kar rahaa hum
 "music brings together many of their identities
" ve kehete hai, ''har baar jab main us shaashvat note ko gaata hum, to mujhe ek insaan ke rup main apni simaaon kaa samaran ho jaataa he, jo mujhe aasapaas kii har cheez ke prati samvedansheel banaati he

 Shopping with a credit card is convenient and the needy can be easily taken even if the cash is not in hand
 lekin samajhadaari se iskaa yuj nahin karne par aap bahut badi pareshaani main funs sakate hai
 Credit cards become even more important during the festive season
 vaise, tamaam achche ophers ke chalate bhi is dauraan shopping karne kaa or man karata he
 However, it is also true that a little bit of greed increases during the purchase of a credit card and then it is difficult to control oneself
 aise main thodi samajhadaari dikhaanaa jaruri he
 It is not that you end all the credit card limit in one go and then you will have trouble or you may have to stop the necessary expenses when you give the install later
 credit card phaayde kii cheez he
 So know such 5 tips, which along with good shopping this season will show how to use credit card wisely- 1) Every time you earn reward points while shopping with credit card
 aksar 100-250 kii kharid par aapako 1 point miltaa he
 However, it depends on the individual card and bank
 samajhadaari isi main he ki aap apane jutaaye hue points se apadet rahen or shopping kii pement karne ke dauraan inako bhi yuj kar len
 This way you can get significant savings
 2) credit card se kharidari ke baad apane mobile main sari pement detel or installment ke reminder laga len, jisase aapako yaad rahe ki du date se pehle hi aapako ise clear kar dena he taaki baad main byaaj kaa zyada boj na paden
 Try not to do any more shopping until you make the previous payment
 3) phaltu ke kharch se bachane kii koshish karen
 Never think of bumper offers or sale, think that you can take all the benefits right now
 hameshaa dhyaan rakhen ki companiyaan or brands aksar koi na koi ofer lekar aate hi rahete hai
 So do not be tempted
 varanaa baad main byaaj samet iskaa zyada boj aapaki jeb par pad saktaa he
 4) Make a target to spend a little less than the budget
 agar aapke credit card kii limit 1 lakh he to koshish karen ki aap 80 hajaar main hi apni shopping nipta len
 By doing this, you will be able to use this saved credit at the time of need
 5) har maheene apane credit card kii statement saavdhaanee se check karne kii aadat daalen
 a good way is also to always keep the bill of goods purchased through credit card till the payment is clear
 isse aap aasaani se statement ke saath bill ko vairifai kar paaenge ki kahin koi extra charge to nahin laga yaa koi or gadabadi to nahin he
 Apart from this, cyber security is also a big issue
 kabhi bhi apane credit card kaa pin number or securiticode kisi ko na den
 There is only protection of your money in this
 pehali cheez, yadi aapaki salanaa kul aay par inakam tex du (bakaayaa) he to jitna yah du he, us par 1 april 2017 se lekar jis din bhi aap tex bhar rahe hai, us taarikh tak byaaj dena hoga
 This tax rate is 1 percent per month
 padhein- kahin radd na ho jaae aapkaa pan card! 31 agast tak kar len yah kaam Secondly, on filing your income tax return after the due date, you will be asked what is the reason for this last delay
 ab yah akalan adhikari ke vivek par nirbhar karata he ki vah der se file karne ke liye bataai gai aapaki vajahon ko kitna vaazib maanata he
 If he does not accept your reason and reason, then you may have to pay a fine of Rs 5000
 yah jurmaana atirikt rakam hogi jo aap chukaayenge
 Because, from 1 April 2017 till the date on which you are filing returns, you will also have to pay interest at the rate of 1 percent
 haalanki yah byaaj aapako tabhi dena hoga jab aapkaa du hoga
 Read - even if your PAN number has not been deactivated, check as such teesri cheez, yadi koi bakaayaa nahin banataa he to aapako byaaj nahin dena hoga

 Bollywood's Mr
 Perfectionist Aamir Khan always surprises the fans with his different look in films
 wo apane har kairact ke saath experiment karte hai
 He plays every character of his film with full devotion
 actor har film se pehle apane bal or dadhi badhaate hai
 Now the reason has come to know why Aamir grows hair and beard before every film
 diene kii khabar ke mutabik, aamir apni har nai film se pehle apane bal or dadhi badhanaa isliye pasand karte hai kyonki isse unhen alag-alag luk ke saath khilne main madad milti he
 With this, they can adopt multiple looks in a film and can easily play different characters in the same film
 unki sabhi filmon jaise sikret superstar, dangal or thags of hindustaan aadi main unke alag-alag kirdaar is baat ke pruf hai ki aamir apane kairactor ko lekar bahut syrius rahete hai
 He works hard for his look in every film
 apane luk ko or adhik natural banaae rakhane ke liye, aamir kisi bhi hair ekstansion kaa upyog nahin karte hai

 In this meeting, the Khap Panchayat will decide that a review committee should be put up in the Supreme Court regarding reservation for Jats
 is baithak main rigerveshan hataae jane ko lekar virodh pradarshan kaa faisla bhi kiya jayega
 Significantly, expressing disagreement over the Centre's view of Jat being considered as a backward community, the Supreme Court quashed the notification issued by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 4, 2014, in which the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in nine states Under Jats, reservation was also announced
 nyaayamurti ranjan gogoi or nyaayamurti rohinton fali nariman kii peeth ne kaha, 'ham centre sarkaar ke is mat se sahamat nahin ho sakate ki nau rajyon main jat samudaay pichhadaa varg main aata he, isliye centre sarkaar kii anya pichhadi jati (obisi) vaali suchi main unhen shaamil kiya jaae
 'let us tell you that the UPA government had made a provision to give reservation under OBC to benefit Jats in education and government jobs

 The bjp-led NDA government also supported the previous government's decision
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sushasan kii style ab saamne aane lagi he
 On the instructions of PM Modi, his cabinet secretary Ajit Seth has asked government departments to be more agile in taking decisions
 iske liye sabase pehle ek file ke guzarane ke desk ko kam kar chaar tak simit karne ko kaha gaya he
 It has also been said that the file of any such case should be sent to the Prime Minister's Office or the Cabinet Secretariat, on which there is a doubt
 cabinet sachiv ne ek letters jari kar sabhi mantralayon ko aavedan patr ke aakaar ko ghataane ko lekar bhi nirdesh diya gaya he
 It states that the application form should be reduced to one page as possible
 cabinet sachiv somvaar ko is bare main mantralayon ke ection plan se sambandhit ek meeting lenge
 The directive, issued by Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting in which all ministries were asked to focus on improving the quality of government work and making government work easier for the people
 anaavashyak puraane kanoonon ko khatm karenis meeting main sabhi mantralayon ko yah bakhubi samajha diya gaya he ki mukhya focus kaary samskruti main sudhaar par he
 All ministries have been asked to eliminate at least 10 rules, procedures and outdated laws which are now unnecessary and which do not cause any harm in the process upon removal
 labboluab yah he ki ab kisi bhi maamle main filein chaar paraton se zyada nahin ghumengi
 Currently, a file starts with a Section Officer, goes to the Deputy Secretary or Director, then passes through the Joint Secretary to the Secretary and finally it reaches the Minister's desk
 kai maamalon main to filein seva mantralayon yani kanoon, carmik, vitt or yojana ayog ke hafton chakkar lagaati rahati hai
 However, this circular does not say how long it should take to settle a file (previously it was scheduled for three days)
 filon kaa ricard rakhana jaruricabinet secretary ne yah bhi kaha ki filein or kagajen niyamon ke anusaar hi nikaalen, inke ricard ko sahej kar rakhen jisamen digitaliseshan bhi shaamil he
 Along with this, it has also been instructed that this entire work should be finished in three to four weeks
 seth ne vibhaagadhyakshon or sachivon ko yah bhi kaha ki janata kii shikayaton ko samay se nipataane kii prakriya par dhyaan den
 It also states that the entire department should work like a unit and provide information and add value during the entire process
 sabhi vibhaagon ko yah bhi kaha gaya he ki upie-2 ke lakshyon or uske states kaa vishleshan karen or isaki soochna ko pradhanmantri ke saamne pesh kiye jane vaale pregentation kaa hissaa banaaen
