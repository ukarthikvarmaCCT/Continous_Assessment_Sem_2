 Aggarwal has sent his resignation to the party high command
 haalanki unka istipha abhi tak sweekaar nahin hua he
 In the last election, the Congress had got 43 seats
 is baar party ko sirf 8 siton par hi santosh karnaa padaa
 Coordination or factionalism in the party and the organization was revealed when Sheila Dixit said that she did not get the support of the organization that she should have got

 sutron ke mutabik inakam tex chhot kii seemaa ko 2
 It can be increased from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh
 iske alaava 5 lakh se 8 lakh rupee kii aay par 10 fisadi ke tex slab kaa elaan sambhav he
 If this happens, the tax slab will change for the first time after 5 years
 iske alaava nivesh par tex chhot kii seemaa ko 1
 Announcement of Rs 2 lakh from Rs 50 lakh is possible
 lekin sawaal he ki iskaa phayda aam logon ko kaise milegaa
 Let us understand in this report
 
 
 abhi kya he tex slab ?abhi tex slab 2
 50 Lakh starts at Rs
 yani 2
 There is no tax on annual income up to Rs 50 lakh
 vahiin 2
 People earning between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 5 lakh are included in the 5% tax slab
 jabaki 5 lakh se 10 lakh kii kamai par 20 fisadi kaa tex lagata he
 Apart from this, people earning more than 10 lakhs per annum fall in the tax slab of 30%
 vahiin nivesh par tex chhot kii seemaa 1
 50 lakhs
 iske alaava standard didction 50 hajaar rupee kaa he
 Explain that standard deduction is that part of your annual income, on which you do not have to pay any tax
 is chhot kaa phayda uthaane ke liye aapse iskar vibhaag kisi bhi tarah kaa document bhi nahin maangata he
 The amount of the first standard deduction was 40 thousand rupees
 bataa den ki tex ke saath 4% kaa ses bhi lagata he
 What if there is a change? If according to the sources there is a change in the slab, then people earning up to 3 lakh will be freed from the tax net
 vahiin 5 lakh se 8 lakh rupee kii aay par 10 fisadi kaa slab lagu hua to ek bahut bade varg ko raahat milegi
 If you understand from the example, Ramesh has an annual income of Rs 8 lakh
 uskaa ramesh kamai ke hisaab se 20 fisadi ke slab main aata he
 Understand in a straight language, Ramesh has to pay a rebate of Rs 12,500 + 20% of the total (total earnings - Rs 5,00,000) + 4% cess on earning 8 lakhs
 agar slab main badlaav hua to ramesh ko 8 lakh kii kamai par sirf 10 fisadi tex dena hoga
 However, taking advantage of Ramesh's investment and standard deduction exemption can avoid tax mess
 antarim bajet main kya hua tha badlaintarim bajet main 5 lakh tak kii kamai vaale logon ko ribet kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 This means that this rebate will be applicable only to those income tax payers whose annual income is up to five lakh rupees
 agar taxperes kii aamadani 5 lakh se 10 rupee bhi zyada hogi to use iskar chhot kii praarambhik seemaa2
 Taxes will have to be paid on the entire income of more than 50, that too with cess and surcharge
 haalanki, paanch lakh rupee se zyada kii aamadani vaale ykardaata kai tarah ke nivesh ke jariye apni aamadani ko ribet ke daayre main laa sakate hai

 Bua-nephew ie Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have made up their mind to come together to name a political party in UP and it is expected that there will be a formal announcement about the SP-BSP alliance on Saturday
 haalanki, abhi tak upi main mahagathbandhan kii ghoshnaa hui bhi nahin ki siton ko lekar sahyogiyon main khinchataan kii khabaren aane lagi hai
 According to information received from Rashtriya Lok Dal sources, the RLD has become part of the grand alliance, but the seats have not been agreed yet
 areldi pramukh ajit singh ne kaha he ki unki party sapa-basapa mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa he, magar abhi tak siton par baat nahin hui he
 Ajit Singh said that the SP and BSP will decide on the Congress whether to keep it in the coalition in view of the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, sutron kii maane to areldi ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan se 5 siton kii maang kii he, jabaki sapa-basapa gathbandhan areldi ko teen siten dene ko taiyaar he
 In fact, the five seats RLD has demanded are Hathras, Kairana, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Kairana
 haalanki, abhi tak siton par puri tarah se sahmati nahin bani he
 Actually, Jayant Chaudhary went to Lucknow to meet Akhilesh Yadav two days ago to finalize the negotiations on the seats
 vahaan akhilesh yadav ne unhen siton ko lekar bharosa dilaayaa he
 Bahrahal will not attend Jayant Chaudhary's press conference at the shared press conference of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati on Saturday
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko lakhanu main taj hotel main akhilesh yadav or mivati saajha press conference karengi or mahagathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan karengi
 At the same time, it is also news that before the formal announcement about Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav's SP-BSP, the UP Congress team will also hold a marathon meeting in Delhi and discuss the strategy ahead
 congress bhi basapa-sapa gathbandhan ke maddenjar bhavishya kii ranneeti par charchaa karegi or isamen raaj babbar or piel puniya shaamil honge
 There is such a discussion in the political corridors that these two big parties of Uttar Pradesh i
e
 SP-BSP will contest together in 37-37 Lok Sabha seats
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii kul 80 siten hai
 There is also a discussion in the political streets of UP that the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli will be left in the BSP-SP alliance and no candidate will be fielded there
 iske baad jo siten batch rahi hai usase rashtriya lokdal or anya choti partiyon ke liye choda jaayegaa
 That is, if the alliance between SP and BSP is proved right, it means that the Congress will not be a part of this alliance and SP-BSP will make a strong effort to connect other regional parties of UP
 is tarah se dekha jaae to sapa-basapa kaa sangam hota he to congress bada jhatka to hoga
 At the same time, it will not be less than a big setback for BJP
 bataa den ki vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan bijepi ko 39
 SP and BSP got 22% if they got 6% votes
 donon ke voton ko mila den to 44 fisadi ho jaataa he
 The Congress got only 6 percent of the votes

 On Friday evening, Nitish Kumar, along with Governor Kesarinath Tripathi, staked a claim to form the government

 Nitish met the Governor and claimed the support of 130 mlas
 jeethanram maanjhi: ek mukhyamantri kaa ant, ek mudde kaa janm
 After meeting the governor, Nitish confirmed to reporters that the governor has accepted his claim

 The governor has given Nitish three weeks to prove his majority
 nitish kumaar 22 farvari, shaam 5 baje patna ke gandhi maidan main bihar ke agle mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lenge
 Earlier, after the resignation of Jitan Ram Manjhi from the post of Chief Minister of Bihar, former CM Nitish Kumar attacked the BJP fiercely in a press conference and alleged that the script of this entire game was written by BJP
 nitish ne maanjhi ke istife ke bare main kaha ki ab unki haalat 'khisiani billi khambha noche' jaisi ho gai he
 Nitish apologized to the people of Bihar for his resignation and promised not to take such a decision by running away in spirit again
 puraane tevar main laute nitish
 
 
 After a long time Nitish was seen in his old attitude
 unke haav bhav dekhakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki unke sir se ek bada boj utar gaya ho
 Nitish also used stringy tones and idioms
 nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'ham log pehle se hi maang kar the ki bahumat par faisla bajet satr se pehle kiya janaa chahie
 The governor seemed to agree with this, but you saw what happened later
 aaj jo kuch hua he vah anokhi ghatana thi
 Perhaps for the first time in parliamentary history, the Chief Minister has submitted his resignation before addressing the budget session
 isse vicitra sthiti utpann ho gai he, satr ko bulaayaa lekin sadan main jane se pehle maidan chhod diya
 The high voltage drama continued till last night
 log munh dhakkar andar baahar kar rahe the aapane to sab kuch dekha hi
 "who would do the least gracefully" while taunting the BJP, Nitish said, "yesterday the BJP came out in support of Manjhi
 maanjhi jo chaah rahe the wo bijepi kara rahi thi
 What was said after the resignation was even more ridiculous
 vidhansabha adhyaksh par doshaaropan kiya gaya, aaropon main koi dam nahin tha
 He was tried in court, resorting to court
 ant main samaj main aayaa ki tikadam ke baavjood koi tutaa nahin
 Which did at least gracefully

 bahumat kaa jugad fail ho gaya
 Whatever has happened in Bihar, there has been a spate of BJP everywhere

 From day one we knew that we had majority

 'the script of the entire game was written by BJP
 Nitish said,' BJP has given the air to the game knowing everything
 is puure khel kii script bijepi ne hi likhi thi
 We did not interfere in government work
 meri aadat nahin
 
 
 He left the work he left
 sabane maanjhi ko samajhaayaa ki bijepi ke game plane ko samajhie
 'I had given resignation on the basis of sentiment, i apologize,' Nitish said, 'I took action on the matter of the people
 main maanata hum ki bhaavana ke aadhaar par tyaagptr diya tha, jo ek galati thi
 Hearing everyone's voice, they are ready to work again
 ab hamen mananeey rajyapal ke nirnay kaa intjaar he
 If i get a chance to work, then i would definitely like to say one thing to the public that they will work the same way they worked for eight and a half years
 saarvajanik taur par apni galati sweekaar karata hum, biharvasiyon se maafee maangata hum
 It would have been nice if Manjhi respected the party
 mahadalit shabd kaa izaad maine hi kiya tha
 Is the attack on Bihar president not an insult to Mahadalit? There is no caste identity, the Chief Minister is the Chief Minister and the Governor is the Governor
 bijepi dharm kii raajnneeti ke baad ab cast card khelnaa chaahati he
 Bihar has moved forward and it has to be taken further
 desh kii pragati main bihar kaam karegaa
 'thanks to fellow parties' Nitish said,' Congress, RJD mlas stood firmly with us
 unako shukriya
 Also thanks to Mamta Banerjee and sister Mayawati

 "good governance is our USP

 i would like to tell the people of Bihar not to get caught in the BJP

 Bihar has to be elevated

 The Congress party, which has been away from power in the state of Uttar Pradesh since 1989, is dreaming of coming back in the forthcoming assembly elections
 haalanki congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi is baat kaa andaja he ki uttar pradesh main bhale hi ve akele chalem lekin gathjod jaruri hoga
 In view of this, Rahul Gandhi, in his Kisan Yatra from Deoria to Delhi, had also filled the form with the general public for loan waiver of farmers and half the electricity bill
 ise unhone kisaan maang patr kaa naam diya tha
 It is believed that these demand letters will also play an important role behind ticket distribution in different assemblies
 congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne banaai thi ranneeticongress party ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor is ranneeti ke saath bad rahe the
 Everything was going well too
 isi bich note bandi ne saare muddon ko peeche chhod diya
 Despite this, it was decided that the Congress would proceed on its program, due to this, on Wednesday, in the Congress headquarters, two crore farmers' letters filled with the people of UP were presented to the media
 aaj tak ne in patron kii sachai jaanane kii koshish kii
 Aaj Tak found in its investigation that a large number of people were involved in this campaign, but the hawkers who did the rigging did not come
 aaj tak ke paas aise bhi dastavej maujuud he jo bataate hai ki bhale hi zyaadaatar kisaan maang patr sahi hai lekin kai aise bhi dastavej hai jisamen phone number nadaarad he
 Apart from this, there are many such farmer letters which have been filled in the same handwriting
 aise main kahani kuch or hi ubhar kar aati he
 However, Rahul Gandhi says on this whole matter that he will submit this entire demand letter to the government
 do karod kisaanon ke maang patr puure uttar pradesh se bharva kar laae gaye hai
 Rahul left the rest of the decision on the Modi government
 Now Congress and Rahul say that the decision has to be taken by the Modi government
 ve kisaanon ko karje se maafee na milane kii sthiti main sarkaar ko andolan kii chetavanee dete hai
 However, despite all these news and progress, the question still remains as to why the Congress, which is making Sheila Dikshit Chief Ministerial candidate in Uttar Pradesh, is now talking of alliances at the door of Samajwadi Party
 aise bhi party ko yah jald se jald tay karnaa he ki aakhir vah kis disha main janaa chaahati he
 Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar is upset Uttar Pradesh Congress President Raj Babbar is upset that Prashant Kishore's meeting with Mulayam and Akhilesh is troubling the workers and potential candidates
 vecongress ke kaaryakartaonke bich asamanjas kii sthiti dekhte hai
 In such a situation, it also becomes necessary for the Congress to decide whether it will go with the SP, b
 sa
 Will wait for Pa or proceed in Sheila's name
 ab is baat se to sabhi waakif hai ki shila sirf chanakya kaa ek daanv hai
 In such a situation, the party will soon have to decide which way it will go
 congress party aise main wet and watch kii policy par chal rahi he

 supreme court ne sharaab pine evam uski bikri par pratibandh sambandhi bihar ke kanoon ko darkinar karne ke patna hoicourt ke aadesh par roak lagaai
 The Supreme Court sought a response from all the defendants, including the liquor manufacturers, on whose petition the liquor manufacturers had bypassed the ban law
 in prativaadiyon kii yachika ke aadhaar par hi hoicourt ne nitish kumaar sarkaar ke pratibandh kanoon ko avaidh or asanvaidhanik qaraar diya tha
 The Supreme Court will now hear the case after 8 weeks

 bihar sarkaar kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ke sharabbandi kanoon ko radd karne se bihar sarkaar kii sharabbandi kii muhim ko jhatka laga
 The High Court, while repealing the policy, did not see that the Article of the Constitution empowers 47 states to make such policies under the Directive Principles of Policy
 khud supreme court ne bhi apane kai adeshon main kaha he ki rajya sarkaar sharabbandi ko lekar notification jari kar sakati he
 The comments hoicourt main ek jaj maanate hai ki sharaab pinaa moulik adhikaar ke tahat he jabaki bench main shaamil chif justise ke vichaar isse alag hai
 The liquor prohibition law in Bihar is in the public interest and has been praised by large sections of the society, especially women, because their household income has been lost due to alcohol, debts have been incurred and the health of the families has been destroyed

 supreme court ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ab 8 saptaah baad karegaa
 It is noteworthy that a hearing was held in the Supreme Court today against the High Court's order to repeal the liquor ban law in Bihar
 bihar sarkaar ne 30 sitambar ke patna hoicourt ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti di thi
 The Bihar government's petition has said that the repeal of the High Court's prohibition of liquor law was a setback to the Bihar government's prohibition
 hoicourt ne policy ko radd karte hue yah nahin dekha ki samvidhan kaa artical 47 rajyon ko niti nirdeshak tatv ke tahat aisi policy banane kaa adhikaar detaa he

 (also from the input language) ullekhneey he ki aaj bihar main sharaab bandi kanoon ko radd kiye jane ke hoicourt ke aadesh ke khilaaf supreme court main sunwaayee hui
 The Bihar government challenged the Patna High Court order of 30 September in the Supreme Court
 bihar sarkaar kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ke sharabbandi kanoon ko radd karne se bihar sarkaar kii sharabbandi kii muhim ko jhatka laga

 ) You must have seen the school, Dharamshala, workshop, but have not heard of the referendum
 janamatshaala matlab jahaan har vakt janamat ko apni taraf karne ke liye chhaviyon ko gadha jaataa he
 Today every political party has a professional referendum, which keeps creating images all the time
 kharaab chhaviyon ke samaanaantar aisi chhaviyon kaa utpaadan or prasaaran kiya jane lagata he, taaki netaa ji phir se mahaan dikhne lage
 With the strategy that bad images will blur
 is dilli shahar main aisi kai janamatshaalaayein khuli hui hai
 To me, the whole city feels like a link to the referendums
 patrkaar banane ke baad ham hameshaa khud ko oparation theatre main pate hai
 Every issue looks like a disease, by cutting and pruning a part of it, they consider themselves maharathi doctors
 jabaki puure sharir kaa us beemaari main kya role rahaa yaa us oparation se puure sharir par kya asar padaa, pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We are deprived of the thrill and stress of becoming a citizen or voter, because we are doing the whole operation to tell the other less for our happiness or betterment
 yah baat aapse isliye kahi ki ek voter ke taur par aap kaise tamaam raajnneetik ghatnaon se guzarate honge
 Your guts will be hit by which ghats
 rajaneta yaa raajnneetik dal har vakt aapaki nigaah main hone ke liye kasarat karte rahete hai
 They must have been fearful that they should not fall in your eyes or someone should fall
 haalanki yah har daur main hua he, magar apane daur main dekh rahaa hum ki jab bhi netaa kii chhavi girti he, vah nai chhaviyon ko gadhane main lag jaataa he
 Is politics just a game of managing images
 chhaviyon kii chintaa karnaa or nirantar samvaad karte rahanaa jaays raajnneetik prakriya or adhikaar he, lekin kya aap is jaays chintaa or propeganda main fark kar pate hai
 It may be that people from the entire department are worried, but from whatsapp to Facebook, pictures are piled up about a man's work
 yah propeganda he
 To make the real questions short, lay a web of such true pictures, which make it seem that those questions are not really important
 kya voter in chhaviyon ke nirmaan kii prakriya se aage jaakar nahin dekh paata hota
 Will he forget those questions and become fascinated with the new campaigns posted on Twitter, Facebook? jab bhi koi netaa vivaadon main ghirta he, lagata he ki logon kii nigaah main gira he, to vah tarah-tarah kii kavayad main jute jaataa he
 Starts going among people, spreading some other good things
 soshal media ke zariye positive yaa kuch kaam karte hue apni tasviren laga laga kar vah apni kharaab chhavi par ek tarah se mitti kii nai paraten daalane lagata he
 For this purpose, one to one expert people are employed in the referendum, who have the experience of selling everything from water bubble to soap-surf
 rose twitor or fasebuk par aise abhiyaanon ko dekh rahaa hum
 If someone is cutting the lace, a picture of someone signing the file has been released
 in tasveeron se netaa ko athak prayaas karata hua dikhaaya jaataa he, jabaki inamen se koi bhi abhiyaan mul sawaalon se nahin takaraate
 Rather, those questions are used to create other images
 kisi kii madad kar dete hai, to koi nayaa skim launch kar dete hai
 Somewhere, they give long speeches
 twitor par aisi tasviren theli jane lagati hai
 a new campaign for TV is launched
 raajnneeti main jansampark jari rahanaa chahie, lekin jansampark kaa matlab janata se sampark kii jagah janata ke paas jaakar apni chhavi chamakaana bhar rah jaae, to ek voter ko apane kaan khadey kar lene chahie
 Public relations has just become a department of image management
 isamen logon se judane or unhen sunne kii eemaandaaree nazar nahin aati he
 Advertisements from remote states have started appearing in newspapers in Delhi
 karodon rupee kharch kar dilli main yah abhiyaan kyon chalaaya jaataa he, apane rajyon main kyon nahin
 Does this mean that people writing in newspapers here do not see outside Delhi
 baahar kii tasveeron ko khud chalakar dilli kii taraf aana hota he
 Between covering images with images, the public or the voter must see if his life is changing
 uske aas-paas kii zindagi badali he yaa nahin
 Whether or not relatives change her life
 sirf chhaviyon ke dam par nai chhavi garh dene kii soch janata kii sahaj buddhi ko kam aankna he
 The purpose of writing this is to know how much you see all these efforts
 kya sachmuch aapke liye yahi badi baat hoti he ki koi netaa aapke bich aa gaya yaa twitor par badhai sandesh de diya yaa aap in sab chhaviyon kii dhundh se pardaa hataakar asli kaam ko dekh pate hai

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has denied the possibility of an alliance in Delhi only after the Congress's refusal for an alliance in Haryana after Punjab, and said that if the BJP is ruling again after the elections, then the Congress is responsible for it
 Will be
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri evam aap (AAP) netaa manish sisodiya (manish Sisodia) ne shanivaar ko kaha, “congress ne kal (shuukravaar kii) raat haryana main bhi aap (AAP) ke saath gathbandhan se inkaar kar diya he, aise main sirf dilli main congress se gathbandhan ke liye aap taiyaar nahin he
 "manish Sisodia said, 'AAP (AAP) had taken the initiative of coalition only to prevent the' modi-shah 'pair from coming back to power, but the Congress is engaged in mathematics of seats
 uskaa maqasad modi-shah kii jodi ke khatare se desh ko bachaana nahin he
 However, he still said on the question of a full stop on the alliance talks, "we have done everything possible on our own behalf
" ab congress ke upar he ki vah kya karti he
 i do not think the Congress is ready to stop the BJP
 ” is dauraan gathbandhan ke liye baatcheet kar rahe aap ke rajyasabha sadsy sanjay singh ne kaha ki agar chunaav baad modi shah kii jodi satta main vaapasi karti he to iske liye congress jimmedaar hogi

 congress andruni taur par khud maanati he ki haryana main unki haalat bahut kharaab he
 The Congress, which was behind AAP and JJP in Jind's by-election, also got a clear indication of this
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki haryana main milakar chunaav ladane ko lekar kai formulon par baatcheet ke baad congress or jejepi haryana main 7-2-1 ke formule (congress saat, jejepi do or aap ek) par taiyaar ho gayi
 But on Friday night, the Congress turned away from it
 sisodiya ne kaha ki congress se mili sandesh main kaha gaya he ki party sirf dilli main aap ko chaar seat dene ke liye taiyaar he
 It is clear that the Congress is not ready for an alliance
 sisodiya ne congress ke saath gathbandhan par antim daur kii baatcheet ke liye aap pratyaashiyon ke namakan ko somvaar tak ke liye sthagit karne ke faisle main badlaav ke sawaal par kaha ki namakan somvaar ko hi hoga
 It is clear that the option of deferment given by AAP till Monday on Monday to reconsider its stand remains intact
 sutron ke anusaar congress par dabaav banane ke liye aap kaa yah antim prayaas he

 prashanth bhushan par saream hamale kii is ghatana ke mahaj kuch ghante ke bheetar hi ise lekar raajnneetik dalon main raajnneeti bhi shuru ho gai
 The two largest parties of the country condemned the incident, but after the condemnation, they were equally impatient to accuse each other on the pretext of attack
 sabase pehle bayaan aayaa congress party kii ore se
 Although party general secretary Digvijay Singh is known as an opponent of Team Anna, but this time he got an opportunity to target the BJP on the pretext of his
 congress ke aarope par bijepi kii ore se bhi kadi pratikriya ai
 Digvijay Singh's allegations were wrongly stated
 badale main ye bhi kaha gaya ki prashanth bhushan par hamale kii sajeesh main congress bhi shaamil ho sakati he
 Whose statement is so close to the truth is difficult to say at the moment, but the political parties from which Anna's members keep distance
 ab unhen bhi unke kandhe par hi bandook rakhkar apana raajnneetik hit saadhane kaa mauka to mil hi gaya
 Family planning is important for any couple

 Eat a healthy diet Many couples do not pay attention to this, while both food and reproduction are intimately linked to each other
 iske liye santulit or poshak aahaar kaa seven karen, jisamen vitamin or aayran se bharpoor subjiyan jaise paalak, brokeli tathaa sabut anaaj, jaise sabut gehun, brown rice tathaa bajra or paneer, anda, machhlee, soyabean jaise protein vaale padaarth shaamil hon, processd food, maida or shakkar se duuri banaakar rakhen
 Stay fit and active does not mean that you spend most of your time in the gym
 lekin apni dincharya main ek saamaanya eksrasij yaa physical activity ko shaamil karen
 This helps to maintain hormone balance and blood circulation and increase the chances of conception
 aapke liye brisk walk, lite jogging, cycling or swimming jaisi activities behatar sabit hogi
 Use a Fertility Monitor During each natural cycle of women, there are only a few days when there is a possibility of conception
 prayek danpati ke liye yah aavashyak he ki ve swayan ko apane garbhadhaaran ke sabase adhik sambhaavna vaale dinon ko lekar sajag karen, kyonki prayek mahila kaa chakra alag hota he jo ki unamem hormones ke str ke hisaab se niyantrit hota he isliye fertility monitor kaa prayog karne se bahut badi madad mil sakati he
 These monitors can identify at least 6 most likely days of conception of your cycle
 inito, daiji jaise brands ke fertility monitor aajkal bahut lokapriy hai
 Not stress: Both stress and anxiety decrease the release of fertility hormones and can hinder the process of ovulation
 to tanaav mahasoos hone par meditation yaa yoga ke dwaara khud ko niyantrit karne kaa prayaas avashya karen
 Share your feelings with your spouse, friends or family, this lightens the mind
 caffeine or alcohol ke seven se bachencaffeine ke seven ko ghataana or alcohol se duuri bananaa bhi garbhadhaaran ke avasaron ko badha saktaa he
 Although it is safe to consume small amounts of tea or coffee, it should be avoided

 Jadeja took a run on the next ball
 iske baad khalil ahamed bhi ek ran ke liye daude
 So India had to score one run from the last two balls to win

 Among the most spectacular wins on foreign soil in India's cricketer history, this unprecedented victory is credited to Mohammad Kaif and Yuvraj Singh as well as captain Sourav Ganguly, who is known for his combative thinking, attitude and disturbing opposition players
 He was famous for answering the antics of 'jaise Ko Tit'
 
 
 saurav ganguli ne lagbhag 'asambhav' jeet ke baad lords kii balcony main apni shart utarkar use puure josh se laharaaya tha, or uske baad maidan main jaakar caff ke upar kudakar unase lipatakar khushi zaahir kii thi

 Among the most spectacular wins on foreign soil in India's cricketer history, this unprecedented victory is credited to Mohammad Kaif and Yuvraj Singh as well as captain Sourav Ganguly, who is known for his combative thinking, attitude and disturbing opposition players
 He was famous for answering the antics of 'jaise Ko Tit'
 
 
 saurav ganguli ne lagbhag 'asambhav' jeet ke baad lords kii balcony main apni shart utarkar use puure josh se laharaaya tha, or uske baad maidan main jaakar caff ke upar kudakar unase lipatakar khushi zaahir kii thi
 
 
 Indian fans saw Ganguly's act as a befitting reply to a similar act by Andrew Flintoff of England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in February 2002
 
 
 flintoff ne bhi mumbai match jitkar shrunkhlaa ko 3-3 se baraabar karne kii khushi shart utarkar or bhaagate hue stadium kaa chakkar lagaakar zaahir kii thi
 
 
 The comments haalanki saurav ne baad main kaha tha ki unki vah harakat 'vakti josh' kii vajah se hui, lekin kuch log ise lords kii shandaar or samrudh viraasat ke naam par dhabba bataate rahe hai
 
 
 But Virender Sehwag, who considers Saurav to be his 'real life hero' even today, remembers it with pride

 (input bhashaa se) Five years ago, he had named his own murderer during his life
 paanch saal baad ab adaalat ne bhi unheen logon ko kaatil qaraar de diya he
 That is, before the murder, he had already told the decision of his murderer
 par kaatilon kaa naam bataate vakt khud use pataa nahin tha ki uskaa katl kis hathiyaar se hone vaala he
 While in the underworld, he was unaware of the new weapon of the underworld, because the specialty of this new weapon was that it would have taken life and nobody even knew
 suresh bhagat, urf mataka king
 
 
 This is the name of a man who had been ruling Mumbai's underworld and matka market unabated for the last twenty years
 itane saalon main jue ke apane dhandhe se suresh ne karodon kamaaye or usase bhi zyada kharch kar die
 To maintain his place in the world of crime
 mumbai kii is kaali duniya par mataka king raaj karata bhi rahata
 Had the Underworld not used its new weapon against it
 
 
 ek hathiyaar, jisase dushman kii maut honi tay he, lekin vah apane peeche kaam ho jane ke baad koi saboot nahin chodta
 This weapon makes every death an accident whose truth no one knows
 lekin pehali baar mumbai police kii tahakikat main saamne aayaa tha anderworld kaa apane dushmano ko maut kii neend sulaane kaa wo tarika, jise sunakar khud mumbai police chaunk gai thi
 Matka King himself told the story of his own death before dying
 kehane ke kuch vakt baad sachmuch mataka king ko maar diya gaya, par ek anokhe tareeke se
 What was that method and why Matka King was killed? Five years after the death of Matka King, a Mumbai court on Friday convicted six people for their murder
 in chah logon main khud mataka king kii wo bivi or betaa bhi shaamil hai, jinka naam usne jite ji ajtak ke camere par liya tha
 The punishment for the slayer of Matka King will now be announced on Monday, but know the story of life and death of Matka King, which was first heard and narrated in the underworld
 mataka king ke katl ke iljaam main chah logon ko doshi qaraar de diya gaya he
 Now you would like to know what is the weapon that the underworld used against Suresh Bhagat, the Matka King of Mumbai? To give him a silent death, on which no one could lift a finger
 darasal anderworld ke in shaatir gangsters ne banaaya tha bhagat ke khilaaf ek aisa phul pruf plan, jiske naakaam hone kii koi surat nahin thi
 This weapon was the most important part of this plan
 suresh bhagat urf mataka king kii mumbai ke mataka bazaar main tuuti bolti thi
 Suresh spread this gambling business known as Kalyan Matka to Gujarat and Rajasthan outside Mumbai and Maharashtra
 is dhandhe main suresh bhagat ne karodon kaa munafa kamaaya, lekin dhandhe main din dooni, raat chauguni tarakkee karne vaala bhagat apane hi gharavaalon se maat kha gaya
 Suresh's wife Jaya and his son Hitesh turned against him for the business
 ab suresh ko apni hi bivi or bete se jaan kaa khatra sataane laga
 So Suresh has also filed a written complaint against his wife and son with the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police
 darasal suresh bhagat jaanata tha ki uski bivi jaya ke arun gavali gang ke badmaash suhas roge ke saath tallukaat the
 Suresh also knew that Jaya could ever take Suhas's help in finding her whereabouts
 aise main police main shikaayat darj karaane ke baavjood suresh bhagat apane aap par mandara rahe khatre se hoshiyaar rahane laga tha
 He had increased his security further
 lekin maamla karodon ke dhandhe kaa tha, lihaaja bhagat kii bivi bhi haar maanane vaali nahin thi
 With the help of Suhas Rogge he spread the gangsters of Gawli gang against Bhagat
 chunauti thi bhagat ko aise thikaane lagaana ki saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi naa toote
 Eventually, the gang men decided that neither a knife nor a gunshot would be used to stab Suresh
 badmaashon ne mataka king ko bam se udaane kaa idia bhi darkinar kar diya, kyonki unhen chahie tha murder kaa ek aisa tarika, jisase unka kaam bhi ho jaae or peeche koi saboot na chute
 Eventually, the gang members decided to use a weapon that nobody in the underworld had heard before
 gavali gang ne suresh bhagat kii maut kaa din tay kar diya
 The date was thirteen June
 us roj jab mataka king suresh bhagat ko sadak ke raste alibagh se mumbai lautnaa tha
 The time had come when the underworld had to try this weapon for the first time
 gang ke gurgey iske liye alibagh se mumbai ke raste par ghaat laga kar baith gaye
 The maneuver had already taken its place
 
 
 or bas ab in sabhi ko intjaar tha mataka king ke guzarane kaa
 Suresh Bhagat went to Alibaug in connection with a case against him that day
 court kii karrwai se nipatane ke baad use sidhe mumbai lautnaa tha
 So he rode in his Scorpio car to Mumbai with six of his colleagues
 driver ne gaadi chalaane se pehle hameshaa kii tarah bhagwaan ko yaad kiya, phir nikal padaa mumbai kii ore jane vaale raste par
 Unaware that his death awaits him on the way
 bhagat or uske saathi abhi aadhe raste hi pahunche the ki saamne se aa rahe ek trek ne unki gaadi ko itani jor kii takkar maari ki bhagat kii gaadi ek jatke se sadak se neeche ja giri
 The collision was so strong that the Scorpions went flying
 suresh bhagat or uske chah saathiyon kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 With this, the plan of the underworld succeeded, under which the Matka King of Mumbai was removed from the road forever
 gavali gang ke badmaashon ne darasal badi hi chaalaaki se bhagat ko khatm karne ke liye bandook kii bajaae ek trek ko hathiyaar bana liya tha
 The gang henchmen knew that if they used any other method for the murder of Matka King, the police would find them out soon
 isiilie unhone kisi sharp shooter kii bajaae ek trek driver ko supaari dekar is katl ko ek accident kii shakl de di
 But since Suresh Bhagat had already predicted his death, both the face of the murderer and the motive for killing him were cleared in the police investigation
 police ne maukey se faraar trek driver samet use teen lakh kii supaari dene vaale harish mandvikar or harish ko pantalis lakh kii supaari dene vaale gavali gang ke badmaash suhas roge ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 Later, the whole story came to light during the investigation
 chunki khud mataka king bhi apane jite-jite apane hi kaatilon kaa naam le chukaa tha, lihaaza insaaf kaa kaam or aasaan ho gaya
 Now what the court punishes the culprits, it will have to wait till Monday

 This is England's fifth major victory over India in terms of runs
 james anderson or stuart broad ne bhartiya pari ko tharra kar rakh di
 Anderson took five and Broad took three wickets, leading the world number one Indian team to 261 runs after chasing a difficult target of 458 runs
 bharat kii taraf se yuva suresh raina (78) or vivies lakshmana (56) hi kuch der tak sangharsh kar paye
 Sachin Tendulkar was expected to make a memorable 100th international century in this historic Test match but he was inexpensively limited in both innings
 england ne yah match jitkar chaar maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kii
 If Ishant Sharma's small spell is dropped on the fourth day of the match, then England dominated the entire team in this 100th Test match
 usne apni pehali pari aath wicket par 474 ran par samaapt ghoshit karne ke baad bharat ko 286 ran par out kar diya tha
 After this, in the second innings, he was able to keep his upper hand heavy with the great batting of wicketkeeper batsman Matt Prior and Broad
 raina ne ek chor sanbhale rakhaa lekin duusare chor se sahyog nahin milane ke kaaran vah haar kaa antar hi kam kar paye
 Finally, Anderson dismissed him as the ninth batsman
 raina ne 136 gend kaa saamana karke das chauke lagaaye
 In the next over, Broad completed the England victory ceremony by lbw to Ishant

 Chasing a target of 458 runs, India lost the wicket of opener Abhinav Mukund on Sunday

 In the early overs of the day, the ball that was put in Anderson's good length area took the edge of Dravid's bat and went into the gloves of wicketkeeper Prior
 isse pehle kris tremelet kii gend par forward short leg par khadey ian bel ne unka mushkil kaich choda tha lekin pehali pari main shatak jadne vaale dravid iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye
 Laxman was also on 48 when England resorted to DRS for a catch behind the wicket against them but it was clear from the hot spot that the ball did not go with his bat
 lekin sankat ke samay kai behtareen paariyaan khilne vaale lakshmana apana 53waan ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad anderson kii kam oochaal vaali gend par pul karke midwicket par khadey bel ko kaich dekar bharat ko sankat main daal gayi
 Laxman played 113 balls and hit eight fours
 lekin greem swaan ne agle over main gambhir ko pagabaadha karke bharat kii sthiti najuk kar di
 Swann's direct ball hit Gambhir's pad and after considering the long appeal, Asad Rauf's finger woke up
 tendulkar lunch ke baad vah sahaj hokar nahin khel paye
 Stuart Broad's credible appeal of lbw against him was turned down by Billy Boden
 iske baad anderson kii gend par andrew strans ne unka kaich choda lekin tendulkar iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye or ek gend baad hi pagabaadha out ho gayi
 Anderson's direct ball hit the pad next to Tendulkar's bat and this time Boden did not take any time to lift a finger
 tendulkar jab pavilion laut rahe the to darshakon ne khadey hokar unhen vidaai di
 In this way, the dream of Tendulkar's century on the corn of cricket remained incomplete
 unhone lords par 21
 He has scored 195 runs at an average of 66 and his highest score here is 37 runs
 raina ne chaay ke vishram se pehle hi apana ardhashatak puraa kar liya tha
 He kept his feet still after this but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16) failed to repeat his 2007 performance at this ground
 unhone tremelet kii aisi gend par kharaab shaat khilne ke prayaas main praayar ko kaich thamaya jisamen na to teji thi or naa hi movement
 Anderson then dismissed Harbhajan Singh (12), who caught a short pitch ball at mid on
 raina ne anderson kii swing leti gend par wicketiper ko kaich diya jabaki broad ne is bich pehle praveen kumaar or phir ishanth ko out kiya
 Kevin Pietersen was adjudged Man of the Match for his unbeaten double century in the first innings

 The closer we are, the more it affects our personality and thinking
 isliye apane eks ko bhulane ke liye zaruri he ki ham khud main kuch (achche)badlaav laaen, apana mekaover karen- baahar se bhi or andar se bhi
 Stop calling, messaging your x after the breakup
 unhen apane tamaam soshal media acount se anfriend / block kijiye
 Do not think that you can be friends even after the breakup
 aisa mumkin nahin
 If you think so, then this will only increase your problem
 gahare rishte ke tuutane ke gam se ubar paanaa aasaan nahin
 It often happens that due to stress, people give up drinking or start eating more fatty food
 ve khud ko kamare main band kar lete hai, baahar nahin nikalate, logon se baat bhi nahin karte
 All these have a bad effect on their health
 isliye paushtik khaanaa khaaen or apane Return to the fitness routine
 yaad rakhie, 'pehla sukh nirogi kaaya'
 So unless you are healthy, there is no question of makeover
 brallep ke baad laazmi he aapke andar jajbaton kii tsunami umad rahi ho
 But the best way to calm him is by shopping
 ye vaala formula ladakon par bhilagu hota he
 People first change their look after a breakup
 nae kapade, nayaa heirkat, nayaa style aapke brakeover main madad karegaa
 This whole process stresses you mukt or 'unase' dhyaan bhatakaane main madadgaar sabit hogi
 After the breakup, do something you have never done before, or are afraid to do
 kisi adventure sport ko tri karen, akele baar jaaen, gym kaa sabase 'khatarnaak'eksrasise karen, kisi ajanabi se baat karen
 Saying this means that you increase your scope
 isse aapkaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 Where have you always wanted to go? Go there abhi
 If your 'X' kept you from going there, then definitely go
 doston ke saath janaa mumkin na ho, tehkele jaaiye
 Take care of your safety
 solo trip kii soch rahe hai to parivaaravaalon or doston kii bhi salaah zarur len
 They say, whatever happens is for good
 mana ki aap apane brallep se behad dukhi hai
 But the good aspect of it is that it will give you a lot of time to think about your own decisions, shortcomings, difficulties and merits

 mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke sahaaaropee tahawwur hossain rana ke khilaaf america main somvaar ko shuru sunwaayee ke dauraan abhiyojan paksh ne kaha ki pakistani guptchar agency iesai ke rana or david hedli ke saath sambandh the
 During a hearing at Chicago's Durksen Federal Building, US Assistant Attorney General Sarah Stryker said Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, told Headley, a pakistani-american citizen, after the Mumbai terror attack that the Indians were worth it
 varsh 2008 main hue is hamale main 166 log maare gaye the
 The striker said that Rana helped his old friend Headley, who took photographs while reconnaissance of the targets being targeted there before the Mumbai attack
 iske saath hi rana ne hedli ko apane chicago sthit avrajan udyog ke pratinidhi ke rup main pesh kiya
 The hearing of Rana is widely watched by the world as it may reveal suspicious ties between Pakistan's terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba and Pakistan's Intelligence Agency, which were blamed for the Mumbai attack
 gat do may ko alqaida sargana osama bin laden ke abtabad main maare jane ke baad se iesai jaanch ke ghere main he
 50-year-old Rana has not confessed his crime but his friend Headley (50) of Pakistan's military school time confesses his crime
 is maamle kii sunwaayi 12 sadasyeey peeth kar rahi he
 Charlie Swift, an American lawyer appearing for Rana, says his client was betrayed by his Pakistani-origin friend and suspected terrorist David Coleman Headley
 rana ko nahin pataa tha ki uske vyapaar kaa istemaal apane bachane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Swift said, Rana's only fault is that he was Headley's friend and a business partner with her
 hedli ne mere muvakil ko dhokhaa diya
 He said that Rana did nothing more than start a business with this friend
 striker ne kaha, prativaadee ne na to bandook uthaayi or na hi grenade phenkaa
 Not all members working in a complex conspiracy use weapons
 aisi sajishon ko samarthan dene vaale prativaadee jaise logon uski safalataa ke liye bahut ahm hote hai
 Rana's lawyer said that his client was cheated by his old friend and did not know what was in store
 swift ne peeth ko bataaya ki hedli ek jodtod vaala vyakti tha jo kai kai kaamon main santulan sthapit kar chalata tha
 This included working for lashkar-e-taiba, the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and the US Drug Enforcement Administration at the same time
 baharhaal, striker ne kaha ki rana ko acchhee tarah se pataa tha ki vah kya kar rahaa he
 He said that Rana provided Headley with a means to conceal his identity because he (headley) introduced him (rana) as a representative of his Chicago-based immigration industry
 unhone kaha, prativaadee ko acchhee tarah se pataa tha ki jab hedli videsh ke kisi desh kii yatra karata he to log maare ja sakate hai
 He said that the government would show evidence to the bench which included messages from emails between Headley and Rana which were written in secret signs
 unhone kaha ki hedli rana ko vishwa main apana sabase sarvshereshth mitra maanata tha
 Rana is the seventh accused in the charge sheet and the only defendant who is in custody

 Along with his look, experimentation is also for the saturation of Abhishek's different work style
 ek baat to tay he ki aalia kaa yah nayaa luk raf or unki persenality se match nahin hone ke baavjood bade sarprise dene vaala he
 From the first look, it seems that Alia is a daily wage laborer
 aalia ke chehre par akpressant se zyada dark tone par kaam kiya gaya he
 Alia's skin color in this film is three shades darker than her skin color, so that she can justify the character of her Bihari girl

 Recently, Priyanka Chopra and Zaira Wasim's upcoming film 'the Sky Is Pink', director Shonali Bose, asked for the removal of article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 Has expressed his anger

 It has been two weeks since the unprecedented communication blockade of Jammu and Kashmir
 My heart is heavy as the sky is dark over India's democracy right now
 My heart has always ached for the terrible human rights violations in the Valley - right from the times of the Congress government in the 90's
 The disappearances and killing of innocent youth is not new
 Nor is the opening of fire on demonstrations
 But this government has crossed every line with it's draconian measures
 i want to ask every Indian - every Bengali, Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamilian et al - how would you feel if your State was split overnight and converted into a Union Territory? Leave Article 370 aside for a moment and answer that honestly
 For me the shock and anger at this unconstitutional act is laced with sorrow at how our own people must be feeling in this part of our country
 Feelings we can only imagine - as there is still a blackout! On a personal level i have never known anyone before in the State
 But now i have a child there
 Zaira Wasim - the heart and soul of The Sky is Pink
 i have known her and her family over one year - spent marvelous times with them in both Srinagar and Jammu
 i was with them in Jammu just a day before this happened
 Zaira was very worried that something terrible was afoot because of the sudden influx of massive troops
 i reassured her not dreaming something so draconian and unprecedented could be carried out
 And since then I'm besides myself with worry at not being able to reach her
 To give her strength at this difficult time
 To wish them Eid Mubarak
 I'm sure they couldn't celebrate it
 We parted with the promise to stay in touch every day
 Echoing a promise she and her brother make to each other in the film in a brilliantly acted and moving scene
 But i can't reach my baby right now
 # notmyindiaa post shared by Shonali Bose (@shonalibose_) on Aug 17, 2019 at 10:16pm PDT Shonali Bose wrote a long post on his Instagram account expressing concern for Jammu and Kashmir (zaira Wasim)
 unke mutabik, 'jammu-kashmir main sanchaar par pabandi ko ab do hafte ho gaye hai or meraa dil bhartiya loktantr par kaale badal gahraate dekh baari ho rahaa he
 My heart always hurts about human rights violations in the Valley
 maasoom logon ko maarna ye nai baat nahin he lekin is sarkaar ne sari hadein paar kar di hai
 i would like to ask every Marathi, Tamil and Gujarati people how you would feel if your state was cut in one night and made into a union territory
 anuchhed 370 ko kinare rakh bhi den to bhi sachai ke saath iskaa jawaab dijie
 'shonali Bose further said,' My anger at this unconstitutional act has now turned into misery
 main sochati hum ki hamaare apane desh log vahaan kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 i did not know anyone there personally before but now i have a baby girl Zaira Wasim
 'da ski ij pink' kaa dil or aatma
 i have known her and her family for almost a year
 main ye sab hone se ek din pehle jammu main uske saath thi
 Zaira was very upset thinking that something big is going to happen
 haalanki tab maine use dhankos bandhaaya tha ki kuch bhi bura mat sochaa aisa kuch nahin hoga
 Now i am not able to reach him in this difficult time
 isko lekar main kaaphi pareshaan hum
 i know that they would not have celebrated Eid
 ham ye kahkar ek-duusare se alag hue the ki ham hameshaa tach main rahenge
 Although i am not able to reach my child

 ' The last Maharaja of Jaipur and Brigadier Bhanwani Singhka is his birthday today (october 22, 1931)
 bhavani singh kii rajshahi or sena main kiye gaye unke kaary ke bare main har koi jaanata he, lekin kya aap jaanate hai kijaipurke is maharaja ko chunavi ran main ek aam netaa se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He received this defeat several times from Jaipur MP Girdhari Lal Bhargava and it was a historic election
 baat saal 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii he, jab rajasthan kii rajdhani jaipur loksabhaa seat se har baar kii tarah bhartiya janata party ne girdhaari laal bhargav ko chunavi ran main utaara
 While there, Maharaja Bhawani Singh of Jaipur was in front of him
 bataa den ki girdhaari laal bhargav saamaanya prishthbhumi se aate the or unka ek naaraa'jiskaa koi na puche haal, uske sang girdhaari laal'bahut mashhoor tha
 This election was between a king and a common man
 der raat shaadiyon main pahunchate thebhargav logon ke sukh-dukh main shaamil hone vaale netaa the
 He was the one who immersed the ashes of many unclaimed dead bodies and he continued to do this during his tenure
 sthaneey jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is chunaav ke dauraan bhi wo prachaar main kaaphi vyast the, lekin wo raat ko do baje shaadi main pahunchate the or laavaaris shavon kaa sanskaar karne kaa kaam karte the
 Apart from this, he preferred to do public relations in the city on a scooter
 is chunaav main bhavani singh ke liye chunaav jeetna thodaa mushkil tha
 So he made a lot of effort to join the common man and gave a slogan against the Girdhari Lal Bhargava slogan - 'me Thanka Aur The Mahara'
 iskaa matlab he 'ham aapke or aap hamaare'
 It is said that during that time the 'tripolia Gate' built for commuting for the royal family of Jaipur was also opened to the common man
 haalanki bhavani singh ke sabhi daawein fail ho gaye or lambey prachaar ke baad bhi is aitihaasik chunaav main bhavani singh kareeb 84 hajaar 497 voton se haar gaye

 Is it a coincidence or a well thought out conspiracy? kai sawaal uthte hai
 After all, what is the reason for this turmoil? Bahujan Samaj Party has not contested the elections of urban bodies since 1995 on its election symbol
 naa koi upachunaav ladaa naa hi panchayaton ke chunaavon main ummidavaar banane kii ijaajat apane kaaryakartaaon ko di, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh se ek bhi seat naa jeet paane ke jatke or 2017 main hue vidhaan sabha chunaav main 23 fisadi vot ke saath sirf 19 siten hi paane ke afsos ne party ko duusare vikalpon par bhi vichaar karne ko majaboor kar diya he
 In view of the party's poor condition in urban areas, on April 19, the party supremo Mayawati announced that now the party will contest the election of urban bodies in the next months on its elephant symbol
 iske liye shahari str par cametiyaan banaakar kaaryakartaaon ko sakriy hone ko kah diya gaya
 Activists also became active
 iske turant baad se hi khun kharaba or maahaul bigaadane kaa kaam shuru ho gaya
 On 20 April, Ambedkar Yatra was leaving in Dudhli

 Two days later, on May 23, the spark erupted after BSP supremo Mayawati held a public meeting in the guise of public relations

 The next day, a man was shot at five o'clock in the morning

 shiv sena ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko aade haathon liya he

 After visiting Kokrajhar and adjoining area in Assam, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) International CEO Pravinbhai Togadia said that Bangladeshi intruders who have been inhabited and given voter ID cards, endangering national security, are out of the country

 bihar main mal or mitti kharid maamle main ravivaar ko ek nayaa mode us vakt aa gaya jab argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne sweekaar kiya ki haa jis zamin par mal ban rahaa he wo unke beton ke naam par he or party ke saansad prem gupta ne yah jameen unke beton ke naam kii he
 BJP leader Sushil Modi, while stating that he did not give his facts as a minister in the annual Declaration, has once again demanded Nitish Kumar to sack both his cabinet colleagues Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav
 rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ne kaha ki har aadmi chahta he ki uskaa ladkaa dhandha kare or gudadi main lipat kar na rahe
 Also, in the light of asking questions from the media about his under-construction mall in Patna, he said that if i have land, we will not use it commercially
 (lalu ke beton ke paas he 30 karod kaa plot, yahi he kai ghotaalon kii asli vajah : bihar bijepi) Lalu Yadav was addressing a press conference in Patna on Sunday in which he was accompanied by Prem Gupta, who was at the center of the party's parliament and disputes
 prem gupta, jinaki company is mal kii jameen kii maalik thi or baad main usne ise lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi or unke beton tejpratap yadav or tejasvi yadav ke naam kar diya
 Gupta admitted that he had transferred the land but he did not give a clear answer to why
 haalanki donon netaa bijepi netaa susheel modi se khafa dikhe lekin modi dwaara lagaae gaye adhikansh aaropon ko lalu or gupta ne sweekaar kiya
 Prem Gupta claimed that he had not sold the land but the transfer of the shares
 bijepi netaa sushil modi ko chunauti dete hue prem gupta ne kaha ki wo pradhanmantri ke paas jaakar jaanch kara len, unhen koi aapatti nahin hogi
 And also said that due to the threat of Modi's lawsuits, there was no industry in Bihar
 ('lalu yadav ne chaar lakh rupee main 72 karod kii jameen beton or patni ke naam karai
 
 
 ') Comments vahiin rashtriya janata dal ke supremeo lalu yadav ne kaha ki agar susheel modi ko lagata he ki unke prabhaav ke kaaran railway ne gaajar ke daam par do hotel lij par diya he to rail mantralay se radd karvaa len
 Lalu asked Modi to raise the soil issue in Sanjay Gandhi Organic Park instead of making the mall land controversial
 nishchit rup se lalu or prem gupta mal ke mudde par lag rahe aaropon se pareshaan dikhe
 Prem Gupta said that if the mall is opened then people will get employment and the government will get the benefit of revenue
 (jab lalu mitti ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar hai, phir CM nitish der kyon kar rahe hai? : susheel modi) Meanwhile, BJP leader Sushil Modi said why Lalu Yadav is not answering why his two minister sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav did not discuss this land and their involvement in the company in their annual statement
 modi ne ek baar phir is aadhaar par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se donon dwaara is sachai ko chhipaane ke liye barkhaast karne kii maang kii
 Modi challenged Lalu Yadav to make his other benami property also public, saying that if he did not, then i have all the papers and i will make it public myself
 lalu yadav ravivaar ko patna main ek sanvadata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the jisamen unke saath party ke sansad or vivaadon ke centre main rahe prem gupta bhi maujuud the
 Prem Gupta, whose company was the owner of the land in the mall and later renamed it to Lalu Yadav's wife Rabri Devi and his sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav
 gupta ne mana ki unhone jameen kaa hastantaran kiya lekin kyon kiya uskaa unhone saafe saafe jawaab nahin diya
 Although both leaders appeared angry with BJP leader Sushil Modi, most of the allegations made by Modi were accepted by Lalu and Gupta
 prem gupta ne daawa kiya ki unhone jameen bechi nahin balki share kaa transfar kiya gaya he
 Challenging BJP leader Sushil Modi, Prem Gupta said that he should go to the Prime Minister and get him investigated, he will not have any objection
 or ye bhi kaha ki modi ke mukademon kii dhamkee ke kaaran bihar main koi industry nahin lagi
 ('lalu Yadav got 72 crores of land for sons and wife for four lakh rupees)
 
 
 ') tippaniyan On the other hand, Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Yadav said that if Sushil Modi feels that due to his influence, the railways have leased two hotels at the cost of carrots, then get the railway ministry canceled
 lalu ne modi se poocha ki wo mal kii jameen ko vivadaspad banane kii bajaay sanjay gandhi jaivik udyaan main mitti kaa mudda uthaaen
 Of course, Lalu and Prem Gupta were upset with the allegations on the mall issue
 prem gupta ne kaha ki agar mal khulegaa to logon ko rojgaar milegaa or sarkaar ko rajasav kaa laabh hoga
 (when Lalu is ready to investigate the soil scam, why is CM Nitish delaying ?: Sushil Modi) is bich bijepi netaa susheel modi ne kaha ki lalu yadav is baat kaa kyon jawaab nahin de rahe ki aakhir unke donon mantri bete tejpratap or tejasvi yadav ne apane vaarshik byore main is jameen or company main apni bhagidaari kii charchaa kyon nahin kii
 Modi once again demanded the dismissal of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on both grounds to hide this truth
 modi ne lalu yadav se jald apni anya benami sampati bhi saarvajanik karne kii chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar unhone nahin kiya tab mere paas saare kagajaat hai or main khud ise saarvajanik karuunga

 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the CBI, had said that Kumar was in charge of the investigation of the SIT and allowed the seizure of the seized mobile phones and laptops from the accused, which had a significant record of alleged involvement of political officials in the scam

 Immediate work started on regularizing them, regularizing irregular colonies, raising the level of government schools to the same level as public schools, creating Jan Lokpal, formation of Mohalla Samiti, setting up 500 government schools, giving loans to Dalit entrepreneurs at 0% interest rate, etc

 aam aadmi party bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan se is mukaam par pahunchi he, lekin kya yah sambhav hoga? jab ramlila maidan main anshan kiya to anusuchit jati / janajati parisangh kii ore se ek raily samanaantar kii gai or inase sawaal kiya gaya tha ki kyon nahin apane bill main udyog jagat, media evam enjio ke bhrashtachar ko shaamil kiya?lokapal main aarakshan dene kii bhi baat nahin thi to hamane bahujan lokapal bill pesh karke daliton, adivaasiyon, pichhadon va alpsankhyakon kaa aarakshan sunishchit karaayaa
 The way the media, ngos and industry support them, if i get even half of this, then perhaps it can affect the society more
 ab bhi mere sanghathan ke baraabar ke kaaryakarta inke paas nahin honge lekin media jis tarah se 24 ghante inako dikhaa or likh rahaa he, logon kii soch inaki bandhua ban gai he, yah bhi ek tarah kaa fasiwad he
 Will the country improve by condemning the corruption of officials and leaders? Why don't they say something about corruption of industry, media and ngos? Unless it is social justice, will it be healthy politics? Arvind has not yet shown any commitment to social justice
 18 sutreey maang par jo patr inhone sonia gandhi ko likhaa he, usamen aarakshan nahin he or isi se inaki maansikta kaa pataa lagata he
 Arvind has been active on the platform of anti-reservation organization - Youth for Equality
 dekhnaa he ki kya unke jan-lokapal bill main udyog jagat ke bhrashtachar ko shaamil karenge? kya aarakshan kaa praavdhaan usamen hoga? jo dikh rahaa he, vaisaa he nahin kyonki aam aadmi party ne bhi jaateey sameekaran ke aadhaar par tikat diya he—jaise, ambedkar nagar, trilokapuri, sultanpuri or mongolpuri se balmiki pratyaashee utaare jahaan par is jati kii sankhya zyada he
 The Aam Aadmi Party definitely has some achievements and that is their simplicity and some initial honesty
 haalanki arvind kii shuruyaat ford foundation ke anudaan se hui he
 Foreign donors definitely have some purpose
 paaramparik partiyon ke netaaon ke ahankaar, bhrashtachar or mahangaai se log pareshaan hai or yah bhi ek kaaran tha ki ve inaki ore mukhaatib hue
 In 2011, Anna Hazare's agitation against corruption suddenly created an atmosphere

 arvind or unke saathi iradatan sakriy rahe ki aage chalakar is sabakaa laabh uthaanaa he or ant main hua bhi yahi
 From the unnecessary propaganda Arvind is making to form the government, it seems that he has less confidence in work and more in talking
 vaise arvind jaisaa daawa kar rahe he, waisi sarkaar chalaa jaaen to isse acchhee baat desh ke liye kya hogi?(lekhak indian revenue sarvice main arvind kejariwal ke senior rahe

 rahul ke saath chaatro ne icecream kaa lutf bhi uthaaya
 During this time, the NSG team was stationed outside the cafe
 kai logon ko to hotel ke baahar suraksha kaa ye baari taam-jhaam to samaj main hi nahin aayaa
 It is believed that Rahul Gandhi will also hold similar meetings with different sections of society
 rahul gandhi isse pehle bhi kai baar achaanak kabhi kisi dhabas par to kisi restaurant main jaakar logon ko chaunkaa chuke hai
