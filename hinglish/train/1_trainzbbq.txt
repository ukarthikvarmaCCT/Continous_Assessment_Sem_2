 5 fisadi ghar main bukamp se zyada khatra he
 At the same time, 85
 5 fisadi gharon ko thode kam nuksaan kaa khatra he
 The controversy has arisen due to a Facebook post by BJP MLA Banwari Lal Singhal from Alwar city of Rajasthan
 is post ke baad jab shahar vidhayak banavaari laal singhl se baat kii gai to unka kahana tha ki desh main muslim samaaj ke dwaara 2030 tak puure desh ke shashan kii bagdor apane haathon main lene ke liye sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat muslimon kii aabaadi badhaai ja rahi he
 The Hindu legislator at risk says that Hindu couples are producing one or two children, while Muslim couples are producing 8 to 14 children
 kai baar to muslim dampati santan paidaa karne ke liye mahilaon ko kharidkar laate hai or bachche paidaa karte hai
 The rapid pace with which the Muslim population is increasing will threaten the existence of Hindus in the coming years
 unhone kaha ki muslim aabaadi adhik hone par zyada se zyada rajyon main mukhyamantri, desh kaa pradhanmantri or raashtrapati muslim honge
 After this, such laws will be made by Muslims that the existence of Hindus will be endangered
 musalmaan hinduon ko jail main thuns denge or hinduon ke sansadhano kaa khud istemaal karenge
 Singhal says that he has posted this post after getting a video
 video main ek sant ne channel kii live dibet ke dauraan tathyaatmak or sankhyatmak tathy prastut kiye hai
 The figures given by the saint are correct, he took the Facebook post to awaken the people of the society, considering it as the base
 ladkiyaan kharidkar kar rahe hai shaadividhayak ne bataaya ki video main kaha gaya ki jis desh main musalamaanon kii jansankhya 30 fisadi se adhik ho jaati he us desh main muslimon kaa kabja ho jaataa he
 Such examples have been seen in history in our country in the past
 yahi nahin alvar main aise bhi kai maamle saamne aae hai jahaan santan paidaa karne ke liye muslim samaaj ke logon ne bihar, bengal se ladakiyon ko kharid kar laayaa gaya or unase duusari shaadi kar bachche paidaa kiye ja rahe hai taaki vanshavriddhi ko teevr gati di ja sake
 Banwari Lal Singhal says that education and development is of no importance to the people of Muslim society, their only aim is to increase the maximum population and declare the country as a Muslim nation, and the occupation of power here is a goal
 gives
 bijepi vidhayak kaa kahana he ki hinduon ke dwaara desh ke vikaas ke liye jo tex diya ja rahaa he us aarthik sansadhano ko muslim samaaj ke log chat karne main lage hue hai
 Also, the contribution of Muslim society in the economic progress of the country is negligible
 unhone kaha ki desh main rahakar muslim samaaj ke log hinduo ore desh se pakistan jaisaa vyavhaar karte hai isse sharmnaak ghatana desh ke liye kya ho sakati he
 India Today editor Prabhu Chawla spoke to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi at the Aaj Tak direct talk program
 kuch anshahapane ek statement diya ki raajnneeti meraa mishan he, ambishan nahin
 i tell the younger generation, do not dream of becoming something, do not see anything done
 jab banane ke sapane dekhte ho to kuch kar nahin pate ho, lekin kuch karne ke sapane dekhoge to karte-karte duniya tumhen sahi jagah pahunchaa degi
 What is your mission in politics? Politics is the decision making process
 maan lo main ajukeshan main kaam karnaa chahta hum or 100 skool chalaa saktaa hum
 But if i am in the decision making process, then i can fix the schools in the country, state, district, wherever i am responsible
 raajnneeti kaa uddeshy satta prapti he na?main nahin maanata
 Even if power is not available, a lot can be done in political life
 kuch aadarshon kii purti ke liye raajnneeti ek madhyam he or raajnneeti main shashan vyavastha ek madhyam he, uskaa upyog karo
 What do you mean by ambition? Ambition means go to hell, i will be this
 aapkaa mishan bhi vahi he
 My mission is to benefit the good of my Gujarat, the poor man here
 meraa samay, meri jindagi uske kaam aae
 Why do you say Gujarat, my Gujarat, why don't you say my India? When i serve Gujarat
 
 
 kar lee na aath saal
 If Gujarat does well, it is not the benefit of the country? Do you think that there is no acceptance in the rest of the states, so have given up? i have not tried to know whether i am acceptable or not
 aap sweekaarya to hai hi gujarat main
 You have been picked twice from there
 gujarat kii janata ne mujhe bharpoor pyaar diya he
 These days i am going to the election rallies across the country

 yah sochna ki nagarpalika main acha kaam karnaa desh kaa kaam nahin he, isse desh kaa bahut nuksaan hoga
 Why do you do Gujarat vs India? It is not
 main kah rahaa hum, mujhe is baat kaa anand he ki main hindustan kaa hissaa hum or aisa kaam karke main apane desh kii seva kar rahaa hum
 Statistics show that the work done in the last six years in Gujarat did not happen that fast in other states
 har suchakank par aap aage hai
 Investment is the highest
 logon ko lagata he ki narendra modi aise vyakti hai jo vikaas purush hai or louh purush bhi
 Gujarat has grown, i am glad to hear this from your mouth
 abhi pradhanmantri chunaav daure par aae the, to unhone bhi kaha ki gujarat kaa vikaas hua he
 People say that you are a dictator
 main abhaari hum logon kaa ki ve ek dictator ke bare main himmat ke saath aisa kehete hai
 As Chief Minister, what is the message for the minority Muslim brothers of the country? i do nothing for the minorities nor for the majority
 karuunga bhi nahin
 i owe it to all the citizens of Gujarat
 na main unka sampradaay, na jati or na hi unki birdari dekhtaa hum
 i am a strong opponent of all those who weigh everything from the scales of the sect
 aapke gathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ne aapako apane pradeshon main prachaar ke liye nahin aane diya
 Like, Nitish Kumar did not allow
 main aapse vinati karata hum ki nitish kumaar ne aisa ek vaakya bhi bolaa ho to use dikhaaiye
 Your special love or quarrel in elections is always with the Sonia Gandhi family
 aap unhen mudda banaate hai, wo aapako mudda banaati hai
 Is there any mutual understanding? There is no more personal acquaintance with them, so there is no question of that
 ve aap par prahaar karte hai
 You attack them
 mere paas aisa karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 The one who handles the system is discussed
 aap samarpit kaaryakarta hai
 If seats will increase in your name in Gujarat, Maharashtra, then only Advani will become Prime Minister
 maharashtra main siten badhen yaa kahin or, mujhe shrey dene kii jarurat nahin
 We are contesting elections under the leadership of Advani
 rajnath ji hamaare adhyaksh hai
 This is the collective result of a team
 raashtra ko phayda ho aapke anubhav kaa
 Make your mind a little bigger from inside, not even i can ever become Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri banane kaa jo khwab nahin dekhte, ve bade man ke nahin hai? jo raajnneeti main nahin aae hai, ve bhi bade man ke log hai
 Those who do not desire any position, they are also people of great mind

 '' Two young faces have knocked on the plank of the country's Dalit politics
 inamen ek gujarat main dalit andolan se nikle jignesh mewaani hai to duusare uttar pradesh ke saharanpur main dalit-rajput hinsa se surkhiyon main aae bhim sena ke mukhiya chandrashekhar ravan
 Both these young faces have increased the anxiety of BSP chief Mayawati as they are becoming a challenge for her politics
 yahi vajah he ki mayawati apane 62wein janmdin par apane samarthakon ko in netaaon se sachet karti dikhin
 Mayawati, frightened by Jignesh? Mayawati, on her 62nd birthday, alerted party supporters to Gujarat's Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani
 unhone kaha ki jignesh ne nirdaleey rup main jarur chunaav jeeta he, lekin usamen daliton ke vot kaa yogadan nahin he
 Jignesh became MLA after joining hands with Congress
 congress ab parde ke peeche rahakar jignesh ko desh main jagah-jagah bhej rahi he
 Under the guise of this, she wants to take advantage
 isse dalit samaaj ko sachet rahane kii jarurat he
 Let the equation of Dalit politics tell that about 20 percent of the Dalit voters are all over the country
 ek daur main dalit voter pehle congress ke saath rahe, lekin 1980 ke baad dalit raajnneeti main bada badlaav aayaa
 BSP founder Kanshi Ram played an important role in this
 80 ke dashak main hi mayawati kaa bhartiya raajnneeti main udbhav hua
 Kanshi Ram brought Mayawati into politics
 unhone dalit vichaardhaara ko andolan kaa rup dekar siyaasi dal banaaya, jisane aage chalakar uttar bharat kii raajnneeti badal di
 Mayawati's emergence from BSP: bsp's hard-earned BSP took power in UP, the country's largest state
 1995 main pehali baar mayawati mukhyamantri baniin
 After this, Mayawati changed Bahujan's slogan to Sarvajan with changing times
 nateeja acha rahaa or mayawati kii ye bispi 2007 main purna bahumat ke saath upi kii satta main ai, lekin 2012 main bispi satta main vaapasi nahin kar pai or uski ulti ginati shuru ho gai
 Not a single BSP MP won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2017 main bhi bispi ke satta main aane kaa sara khwab bijepi ne chur kar diya or party soobe main tisare paaydaan par ludhak gai
 What will be the danger for Mayawati Jignesh? Even though Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani has become an independent MLA from Gujarat, he has left to play an active role in the rest of the states of the country
 manuwaad or samantvaad hameshaa hi mayawati kii raajnneeti ke nishane par rahe hai
 Jignesh Mevani is also moving forward through the same mantra
 pichley dinon jantar mantar par jignesh mewaani ne piem narendra modi ko samvidhan or manusmriti main se kisi ek ko chunane kii baat kahi
 In this way, he is challenging Mayawati's political formula by making her his weapon
 mayawati ke mukaable jignesh mukhar hai, yuva hai or soshal media kaa istemaal jaanate hai
 His popularity among Dalit youth is increasing
 gujarat, dilli, maharashtra se lekar uttar pradesh tak main unke jane par bheed umad rahi he, jisane mayawati ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Chandrashekhar Ravana, the chief of Ravana's knock-off army in the fort of Mayawati, is from Uttar Pradesh and belongs to the same caste as Mayawati
 ravan ne saharanpur main daliton ke sanghathan bhim sena kii sthapana kii thi
 In 2016, these organizations began to emerge rapidly and within a short time Chandrashekhar became popular among the Dalit society
 pashchim upi mayawati kaa majboot durg mana jaataa he
 There are about 19 percent Dalit voters in UP, Jatavs also have 16 percent participation among them
 mayawati isi samaaj se aati hai or chandrashekhar ravan bhi
 Chandrasekhar associated the Dalit youths of Saharanpur in western UP with the help of big boards of 'the Great Chamar' outside the village
 upi main yogi sarkaar banane ke ek maheene ke baad saharanpur ke shabbirpur main dalit or rajput samaaj ke bich hinsa hui
 Many houses were burnt in the violence
 police ne chandrashekhar par is hinsa kii sajeesh rachane or bheed kaa netritv karne ke aarope lagaakar unhen jail main daal diya
 Chandrasekhar is still in jail
 mayawati shabbirpur kii baat to karti hai, lekin chandrashekhar ravan ke liye ek shabd nahin boltin
 According to experts, Chandrasekhar is having political fear from Ravan somewhere
 congress ke liye turup kaa ikkaa banenge jignesh-ravanjignesh mewaani kaa congress conection jagajaahir he
 If the party succeeds in bringing Chandrashekhar Ravan into its ranks, then through these two young faces it can dent Mayawati's Dalit votes
 saath hi desh main bhi dalit netaaon kaa ek nayaa vikalp de sakati he
 The Congress hopes to return to its good days on the strength of dalit-muslim-backward alliances
 wo isamen kitni safal hoti he ye to 2019 main pataa chalegaa lekin philhal kanshiram ke kandhon ke sahare or dalit maton ke dam par khadi huin bispi supremeo mayawati ke maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren saaf najar aa rahi hai

 Bollywood is full of bold films, whether these films play or not but Sunny Leone has become the face of these films

 Both small and big curtains are covered with linen
 apni tarah kii is star ke berthde par ek fain ne unako likhaa he dil se khat
 
 
 Dear Sunny, Bollywood has been witness that whenever a bold Bala's entry is in the industry, then some days that actress's hangover remains in the hearts and minds of the audience, but gradually her craze starts to fade
 magar tumhaare ke cese main aisa nahin he
 Before entering the film industry, many of us had 'seen' you a lot, despite this, the footfall of fans in theaters for your Hindi films did not decrease
 kyonki fain to fain he jo apane star ko har rup main dekhnaa chahta he
 But one thing i want to tell you is that your beauty and innocence never let this bold image become a slut
 porn star hone kii babat tumhaara craij to darshakon main tha lekin maine khub padhaa or dekha he ki tumhaare liye yah raah itani bhi aasaan nahin rahi
 You are getting work, while many industries coming from 'decent Background' are sitting vacant
 past vaali baat par tum puri eemaandaar ho or yahi khubi tumko duusari hot actress se alag banaati he
 The good thing is that you do not regret the past at all, because you have taken it as a presentation
 tumhaare andar maine ek gajab kii strength bhi dekhi he
 Then, through the questions woven under the guise of porn star image, many interviews tried to make you uncomfortable or uncomfortable
 lekin tum na darin or na hi sahamiin or na hi aise halaat haarin
 Every unorthodox question was answered without any hesitation and since then many 'big people' of the industry have been with you
 bahut se buddhijiviyon netum percinema main ashleelata parosane kaa aarope lagaaya lekin ve shaayad 70 or 80 ke dashak kii filmon ko bhul gaye jab shaayad tum paidaa bhi nahin hui thim
 Many big filmmakers had by then shown 'a lot' on screen
 tumhaari life story padhi he
 At the age of 15, working in a bakery, you were taking up household responsibilities
 shaayad isi vajah se tum jaanati ho ki mushkil halaat ko kaise fais karnaa he, kaam ke prati puri lagan rakhni he or dusron kii phijul baton par kaise dhyaan nahin dena he
 The result of this spirit of yours is that among those who were not wanting you, you have become 'sunny' among them
 
 
 tumhaari ek wel visharasani leonko abhi bhi aap jaan nahin paae hai to unke bare main ye anjaani baaten jarur jaane

 On Sunday evening, the campaign stopped at this seat
 apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan abdulla ajam khan ne jaya pradaa kaa khulkar naam to nahin liya lekin ishaare main bahut kuch bol gaye
 Abdullah Azam Khan's trouble increased, Abdullah Azam Khan's trouble has increased on the statement of Anarkali
 abdulla ajam khan ke bayaan par rampur nirvachan adhikari ne sangyaan liya he
 The Rampur Returning Officer has sent the report of Abdullah Azam Khan's controversial statement to the Chief Electoral Officer of Uttar Pradesh
 rampur nirvachan adhikari ne apni report main abdulla ajam khan ke bayaan kii footage bhi bheji he
 Abdullah Azam Khan, son of Darsal SP leader Azam Khan, targeted BJP candidate Jaya Prada without a name
 gauratlab he ki abdulla khan ke pita ajam khan rampur se sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Jaya Prada is from BJP against him
 abhi haal main ajam khan ne jaya pradaa ke khilaaf ek behad aapattijanak bayaan diya tha jisaki shikaayat chunaav ayog tak pahunchi thi
 Taking the statement seriously, the Election Commission had banned the campaign of Azam Khan
 ek taraf unki tippanee kaa sangyaan lekar mahila ayog ne ajam ko notice bheja to vahiin, duusari taraf unke khilaaf rampur ke shahbaad thane main cese darj karaayaa gaya
 Disturbed by his remarks, Jayaprada said that if this man wins the election, what will happen to democracy? What place will women get in society and how will they be protected? He said emotionally, "will i be satisfied when i die?" Jaya Prada said, "this is nothing new to me
 ajam ne had paar kar di he
 My character is being abused

 "every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox
 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Suppose, what would have happened if these twin elections had taken place four months ago, ie with the Lok Sabha elections
 maharashtra kii ankatalika hoti kuch is tarah- bijepi 144, shivasena 108, ensipi 24 or congress 12
 Similarly, Haryana would have a scoreboard - BJP 63, INLD 18 and Congress 9
 aap puuchhenge kyon
 So the answer is that during the Modi wave in the Lok Sabha elections, all the parties in these states had won the Lok Sabha seats in the same proportion
 maharashtra main congress ko do or haryana main mahaj 1 loksabhaa seat par kamyaabi se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 But after four months the results have changed
 bijepi 144 nahin 110 ke aasapaas he or congress 12 nahin 40-50 ke aasapaas he
 Siswena is swinging between 50-60 instead of 108 and Sharad Pawar's party fork is also hitting 50
 maharashtra main chaar maheene main aisa kya badal gaya? kam se kam congress ne koi aisa mahaan kaam to nahin kiya ki chaar maheene main uski sambhavit siton main 350 fisadi kaa ijapha ho jaae
 And NCP, which has been badly maligned by allegations of corruption in the media, came just below the 2009 level
 to phir badla kya he! badla he wo junun jo loksabhaa chunaav ke samay tha
 Narendra Modi's aggressive rallies, his virginal image at the center's politics and a highly aggressive election campaign
 unke saamne kisi pratidwandvi kaa na hona
 Rahul Gandhi was there to say, but he was just to say
 us chunaav main jab ham patrkaar gaanvon se guzarate hue shahar dar shahar ghoomte the to modi-modi kii sansani hawa main ghuli thi
 Perhaps that sensation has subsided in four months
 modi ab lokapriy netaa hai
 But there are no waves, thunderstorms or tsunamis
 loktantr ke liye yah acha sanket he
 Just remember last October
 tab modiji ko haldi chadhi thi
 BJP had said that it is its groom for the post of Prime Minister
 uske baad madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke chunaav main janata ne vipaksh ko ek-ek seat ke liye tarasaa diya
 In Chhattisgarh, it was expected that there would be a wave like sympathy of the Congress leaders who died in the Zeeram Valley but there was no wave ahead of the Modi wave
 bijepi ne dilli bhi fatah kar hi lee thi, wo to bich main kejariwal kaa nayaa prayog saamne khadaa ho gaya
 After that in the Lok Sabha, all the satraps of North India came in the form of straw
 modiji kii aisi baadh ai jaisi kabhi indira gandhi yaa rajeev gandhi kii ai thi
 But when this aggressive propaganda campaign came to an end, all the bypolls held after the Lok Sabha BJP lost one after the other
 iske liye kam voter turnout ko bhi ek vajah mana gaya
 At the same time it was also said that the public felt that she has become more Modi-friendly, so it is important to be alert
 aise main maharashtra or haryana kaa janadesh swasth loktantr kaa sanket he
 People have only voted for the party, they have not kept the heart out
 vipaksh ke liye bhi gunjaaish chodi he
 This is very important because the biggest contradiction of the democracy of the whole world is that the one whom you beat, for the next five years, you appear to be more benevolent
 sansad main janata kii aawaaj kabhi satta paksh nahin uthaata, vipaksh uthaata he
 Perhaps it was this voice that made Ram Manohar Lohia, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani and Sharad Yadav popular leaders, when the public at that time gave majority to Nehru, Indira or Rajiv
 janata loktantr kii is ulatbaansi ko dil se lagaae rahegi loktantr majboot hota rahegaa

 Because the king of that princely state felt that he would make his sultanate even more beautiful than paradise
 itnaa khubasurat kii duniya ise dekhne ke liye majaboor ho jaae
 But even before becoming a paradise, some people started plotting to make him a soul
 tab ek chitthee ne us jananath ko jahannum banane se bachaa liya
 Which is called the Instrument of Accession
 magar isi instrument of exceshan main darj thi ek dhara
 Section 370
 15 agast 1947bharat ko jab british hukumat se aazaadee mili
 At that time there were 565 princely states i
e
 independent princely states in the current border of the country
 aazaadee ke baad inamen se 3 riyasaton ko chhodkar sabhi bharat main vilay ko raji ho gayi
 These were princely states
 jammu-kashmir, junagarh or hyderabad
 At that time, with the efforts of the government, Junagadh and Hyderabad were merged with India
 magar jammu-kashmir ke maharaja hari singh chaahate the ki unka kashmir swatantra rajya rahe
 Hence he initiated stand still agreement with India and Pakistan
 us samjhaute kaa makasad tha ki unhen bharat yaa pakistan main vilay karne ke liye kuch or vakt mil jaae
 Pakistan had made this agreement with Maharaja Hari Singh but India thought it better to wait in those circumstances
 darasal bharat kashmir ke vilay kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha or maharaja hari singh aaazaad kashmir kaa sapana paale hue the
 24 October 1947 Pakistan broke the pact and invaded Kashmir under the guise of the tribes
 wo kisi bhi vakt rajdhani srinagar par kabza karne vaale the
 And if that had happened, Kashmir would have been part of Pakistan today
 magar maharaja hari singh ne pakistan ke saamne jhukne ke bajaae bharat sarkaar se sainya madad maangana behatar samajha
 But the Government of India placed a condition to help Maharaja Hari Singh
 shart thi ki bharat main vilay
 Therefore, Maharaja Hari Singh agreed to the merger due to the chance of opportunity
 or agali hi subah sardaar patel ke kareebi afasar veepi menon halaat kaa gauge lene dilli se kashmir ravaanaa ho gaye
 Menon was the Secretary of the Ministry of States headed by Sardar Patel
 menon jab maharaja hari singh se srinagar main mili tab tak hamalavar baraamula pahunch chuke the
 In such a situation, he asked the Maharaja to leave for Jammu immediately and he himself returned to Delhi with the Prime Minister of Kashmir, Meherchand Mahajan
 26 oktober 1947halaat aise the ki kisi bhi vakt kashmir kii rajdhani par hamalaavaron kaa kabja ho saktaa tha
 Maharaja Hari Singh was hoping for help from India
 aise main lord mountbeton ne sardaar patel ko salaah di ki kashmir main bhartiya fouj bhejne se pehle hari singh se instrument of exceshan par hastakshar karvaa liya jaae
 So Menon was once again sent to Jammu
 or menon ne isi din maharaja hari singh se instrument of exceshan par hastakshar karwaae or use lekar ve fouran dilli waapas laut aae
 What was the Instrument of Accession, in Hindustani, this question still arises that what was there in the Instrument of Accession of Jammu and Kashmir at that time? In fact, the Instrument of Accession for Jammu and Kashmir was that the Center would have the right to make laws related to defense, foreign and communications of Jammu and Kashmir only
 baaki masale rajya khud dekhegaa
 In clause 5 of this, Raja Hari Singh had clarified that this instrument of accession could not be changed through any amendment
 isko badalane kaa adhikaar sirf raja hari singh ke paas hoga
 And unless Hari Singh signs another instrument of accession, the old one will be valid
 bhavishya main bharat kaa samvidhan banane par unhen use sweekaar karne ke liye patibaddh nahin mana jayega
 Nor will they be asked for any agreement with the Government of India as per the future constitution
 27 oktober 1947idhar, maharaja hari singh ne vilay ke samjhaute par hastakshar kiye or udhar agle hi din yani 27 oktober ko us vakt azaad bharat ke governor general lord mountbeton ne bharat kii taraf se samjhaute ko manjuuri de di
 However, the situation in which Kashmir became a part of India was a period of violence
 or bharat kii policy ye thi ki vilay karne vaali jin riyasaton main kuch bhi dikkat he
 There the referendum means to get the referendum merged according to the intention of the people
 na ki raja kii marji se
 But this could not happen on the issue of Kashmir
 us vakt lord mountbetten ne bhi kaha tha ki sarkaar kii ye ichha he ki jaise hi kashmir main kanoon vyavastha behaal ho jaati he
 Similarly, the decision to include the state in India will be taken according to the opinion of the people there
 27 may 1949 ko paas hua tha artical 370saal 1948 main bharat sarkaar ne jammu kashmir par pesh kiye gaye shwet patr main likhaa ki bharat main kashmir kaa shaamil hona puri tarah se asthaayee or alpakaaleen he
 On 17 May 1949 Vallabhbhai Patel and N
 Sheikh Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 gopalswami ingar kii sahmati se likhe ek patr main purv pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne bhi yahi baat doharaai thi
 And the draft prepared by the Jammu and Kashmir government at the time of the merger
 us par sahmati banane ke liye kareeb paanch maheene tak baatcheet chalati rahi
 After this, article 306 a was passed on 27 May 1949
 jise baad main 370 ke naam se janaa gaya
 This article has been termed as temporary in the constitution, that is, it was to end after a few years but later governments did not abolish it and this article continued
 balki 1954 main tatkaaleen raashtrapati dow
 By order of Rajendra Prasad, Article 35A was made a part of Article 370
 iske tahat jammu kashmir ko apana alag samvidhan banane or kuch dhaaraon ko chhodkar bhartiya samvidhan ko lagu na karne kii ijaajat de di gai thi
 So now the question arises as to how Kashmir joined India
 instrument of exceshan kii madad se yaa dhara 370 se? to isamen pehla pul to instrument of exceshan hi he
 Because it was signed only in 1947
 dhara 370 to 1949 main vajood main ai
 But Article 1 which is mentioned in the Article 370 by law
 usee ke jariye jammu kashmir ko bharat ke rajyon kii suchi main shaamil kiya gaya he
 There has been a debate for the last 70 years about these special rights given to Jammu and Kashmir
 or ab 5 agast, 2019 ko grahamantri amit shah ne iske do hisse karne kii baat kahi he
 That is, the 1
25 billion population of Maharaja Hari Singh's riyasat-e-kashmir and the area of two and a quarter million square kilometers will now be divided into two parts

 Who killed even his father, brother and relatives for the throne
 ab agar aise kisi taanashaah kii gaddi par uskaa koi adhikari nazar gadaaye to zaraa sochie ki ye unka kya hashr karenge
 It is obvious that he will be given such a dreadful death that people will tremble after hearing about him
 aapane aise tamaam krur tareekon ke bare main suna bhi hoga
 But have you ever heard that to kill someone, they should be thrown in front of piranha fishes in the aquarium
 nahin? to ab suniye, ye krur sazaa uttar korea ke rashtradhyaksh kim jong un ne apane 5 adhikariyon ko di he
 Kim Jong Un
 
 In today's era, this person's name is enough to create fear
 magar phir bhi isaki aksar ye koshish rahati he ki duniya main iskaa dabadabaa kam naa hone paae
 Because the fear is over, it will be difficult to maintain the Sultanate in Korea
 or uttar korea main to iske ek general ne isaki hi satta palatney kii sajeesh rach daali
 This may not be a big mistake in Kim's Sultanate
 zaahir he kim jong ko apane is general ko aisi sazaa deni thi ki phir koi aisa karne kii sapane main bhi naa soch paae
 So Kim Jong Un took time to decide the punishment for his general's betrayal
 or wo tamaam filmein dekhi jisamen maut dene ke liye krur se krur tareeke apanaae gaye
 She then set her eyes on James Bond's You Only Live Twice film, released in 1965
 jisamen ek mahila ko maut dene ke liye use piranha machhliyon bhare tanks main phenk diya jaataa he
 Where piranha fishes with their sharp sharp teeth do what no one can even think of in a dream
 sabase pehle jaaniye ye piranha machhlee aakhir kis bhalaa kaa naam he
 Piranha fish are among the most dangerous fish in the world
 jinke daant is kadar paine hote hai ki ek puure insaan ko kha jane main unhen chand seconds kaa hi vakt lagata he
 You can guess how dangerous and dangerous these fish are by looking at their teeth
 jis pani main ye machhliyaan hoti hai
 No other water creature survives there
 or to or ye machhliyaan insaanon ko khaane main bhi gurez nahin karti hai
 And North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong-un put his general in a tank full of these fish and punished him for his betrayal
 aapako bhale is khabar par yakeen karne main vakt lage magar ye kim jong un he
 It does not spare the traitors of its Sultanate
 or naa hi iske paas galati karne waalon ke liye maafee kii koi gunjaaish nahi he
 Marshal Kim Jong Un of Uttarkoria, inspired by this James Bond film, threw his general into the tank of these man-eating fishes by throwing his general into the tank of these man-eating fish
 ye daawa britain ke ek tebloid news paper daily star ne kiya he ki kim ne vafadari par shaq hone kii vajah se apane general ko piranha machhlee se bhare talab main phenkava diya he
 Not only this, the Daily Star claims that Kim has built a big pond in her Rongsong bungalow in Pyongyang
 jisamen piranha machhliyaan pali hui hai
 And it is believed that Kim threw his general alive in this pond
 ek or theonri ye he ki usne apane general ke haath-pair katwakar talab main phenkava die
 And the rest of the cruelty with the corpse of his general was carried out by piranha fishes
 haalanki general kii maut piranha machhliyon ke hamale se hui yaa pehle hi unhen markar inke talab main phenkaa gaya
 It has not been confirmed yet
 sunne main ye khabar naakaabile yakeen lagati he magar uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un kii barbarta kaa jaisaa itihaas rahaa he use dekhte hue ye mumkin bhi he
 The same British newspaper has claimed that these piranha fishes have been sourced from Brazil in hundreds in a tank built in Kim's home
 isse pehle bhi kai baar adhikariyon ko maut kii sajaa dene kii khabar north korea se aati rahi hai
 But on some occasions such reports have also proved to be false and those who were claimed to be dead have also come before everyone again
 yahi nahin america ke saath samjhauta nahin ho paane ke baad north korian shaasha kim jong un ke apane 16 ucch adhikariyon ko maut kii sajaa dene kii khabar bhi kuch vakt pehle saamne ai thi
 This year will be witness to the battle of Hrithik Roshan and Kangana Ranot
 in donon kii ladaai ne khub tool pakadaa, roj nae-nae khulaason ke saath inaki khabaren aati rahi
 For some time, both are calm and busy in their work
 par ab itane dinon baad rithik ke pita rakesh roshan apni chuppi todate najar aae hai
 In an interview to a newspaper, Rakesh Roshanne said, 'hrithik likes to be very calm and dignified
 agar wo sabake saamne sach lekar aata he to log hairaan ho jaaenge
 Rakesh Roshan also said that Kritik is still busy with his film
 vah jaise hi free hote hai, vah is bare main baat kar sakate hai, yah unka faisla hoga
 Where did Mamlakangana use the term 'silly X' while giving an interview to Pinkvilla
 darasal, kuch samay pehle khabar ai thi kikanganako film 'aashiqui 3' se rithik ke kehane par hi nikaala gaya tha
 When asked about this, he said, 'I am hearing many strange rumors
 ek naasamajh bhi andaja laga saktaa he ki ye afvaahen kahaan se aa rahi hai? main nahin jaanati ki eks aapaki atension paane ke liye is tarah kii paaglon jaisi baaten kyon karte hai
 From my side, this chapter is over and now i do not want to dig the grave of those things
 'iske thik baadarithik ne twitakarke kaha tha ki media jin mahilaon ke saath mere sambandh kaa zikr kar rahaa he, usase zyada sambhaavna he ki meraa sambandh kisi pope ke saath ho

 indian commercial payalat association ne air india ke siemdi ko chitthee likh maujuuda halaaton ke bare main avgat karaayaa he
 In the letter, he has written that about 23 per cent of the planes are not working because of this, because they do not have spare parts
 is khat main payalat association ne siemdi ke saamne kadi aapattiyaan darj karai hai
 He wrote that apart from spare parts, due to planning, coordination and finance, the flight of many aircraft is being affected
 jiske kaaran kaaphi asuvidha kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In this letter, he also gave some examples
 associationaki taraf se likhaa gaya he ki airbas A321 ke 20 aircraft air india ke paas hai, lekin usamen se 12 hi oparational hai
 Meaning 40 per cent of the planes are on the ground, due to the lack of spare parts only and only
 unhone likhaa he ki ye sabhi wo aircraft hai jinka istemaal domestic root par kiya jaataa he or inamen siten bhi kaaphi adhik hai
 If such a number of planes remain on the ground, then it is a crime
 naa sirf isse yatriyon ko pareshaani ho rahi he, balki hamaare revenyu par bhi kaaphi fark pad rahaa he
 It has been written that because of this, many flights are being canceled every day, causing inconvenience to passengers
 iske alaava bhi aakhri samay par kai fliton main change kiya ja rahaa he
 All the results of the assembly elections in Haryana have been declared
 yahaan 90 main se 40 siten jitkar bhartiya janata party ek baar phir sabase bade dal ke rup main saamne ai he
 However, it still lags behind the majority figure (46)
 duusari taraf bijepi ke mukhya pratidwandi dal congress ne 31 siten jitkar rajya main apni sthiti ko sudhara he
 Moving away from these two strong parties, Dushyant Chautala's new party Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) has surprised ten seats
 indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) ko sirf ek seat par hi fatah hasil hui he
 Haryana Lokhit Party (HLP) has got one seat and won seven independents
 chunaav parinaam ke baad ubhare haryana ke raajnneetik paridrishy main yahaan trishanku vidhansabha bananaa tay ho gaya he
 Now the JJP and Independent mlas have come to power in Haryana
 haryana main congress or jejepi haath mila len to sarkaar nahin bana sakenge kyonki donon kaa kul aankada 41 tak hi pahonchega
 In this situation, they will have to resort to independents
 duusari taraf 'is baar 75 paar' kaa naaraa dene vaali bijepi apane balboote sarkaar kaa gathan karne laayak sthiti main nahin pahunch pai
 It got 40 seats and was trailed by six seats by the majority figure
 ab bijepi kii najar nirdaliyon par lagi he
 If six of the seven independents also support him, then the way to form his government will be cleared
 haalanki bijepi yadi jejepi se samarthan leti he tab bhi vah sarkaar aasaani se bana sakati he, lekin shaayad bijepi jejepi ke saath molbhav ke chakkar main padana nahin chaahati or isliye usne jejepi ke bajaay nirdaliyon par najar jamaa lee he
 Anyway, since the BJP has become the largest party in Haryana after the elections, its claim for formation of the government will be made first
 swaabhaavik rup se rajyapal bhi use sarkaar ke gathan ke liye aamantrit kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, forming a government with the support of BJP is almost certain
 haryana main mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke netritv main bijepi vidhansabha chunaav main pichley chunaav ke mukaable pichad gai
 It lost seven seats
 vah 90 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bahumat ke jaadui aankade ko chune main vifal rahi
 Apart from this, the BJP suffered a major setback due to the defeat of its ministers
 party ke pradesh pramukh subhash baraala sahit kai mantri parajeet ho gaye
 Not only this, the BJP also fielded famous players like Yogeshwar and Babita Phogat in this election, but it got disappointment from them
 maidan main baaji maarane vaale khilaadi chunaav maidan main chit ho gaye
 BJP may have lost confidence
 anuchhed 370 khatm karne ko lekar chaahe vah apni peeth thapthapa le lekin matadaataaon ke man main uske liye jagah kam ho gai
 On the other hand, the Congress, which has reached very weak condition in Haryana, has improved its situation significantly through this election
 congress ne pichley chunaav ke mukaable is baar 16 siton kii badhat hasil kii
 It has become the second largest party in the state by winning 31 seats
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke liye yah safalataa raajnneetik jeevandaan kii tarah he
 Hooda was no longer in a strong position in the party
 unke party main bhavishya ko lekar bhi sawaal uthne lage the
 The results of this election increased his political power
 is chunaav main navgathit jananaayak janata party (jejepi) kii apratyaashit safalataa se haryana ke raajnneetik samikarnon main ek bada badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 This party, less than a year old, has registered a strong presence in Haryana politics by winning 10 seats
 jejepi kaa janm pradesh ke pramukh kshetreey dal indian neshnal lokdal (inelo) se tuutakar hua tha
 While the JJP showed its impact in the first place itself, the INLD has suffered a major setback after losing 19 seats
 trishanku vidhansabha ke asaar ke chalate purv mukhyamantri or congress netaa bhupendra singh hooda ne sarkaar banane ke liye jejepi samet bijepi virdohi anya dalon ko congress ko samarthan dene kii apil kii he
 On the other hand, BJP is trying to get the support of independent mlas
 in nirdaliyon main gopal kanda sirsa vidhansabha kshetra se, choudhary ranjit chautaala rania se, rakesh daulatabad badshahpur se, nayanpal ravat pruthalaa se, sombir sangwan dadri se or balraj kundu maham vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav jite hai
 Of these, Balraj Kundu, Nayanpal Rawat and Sombir Sangwan were in the BJP till the elections
 in teenon ne tikat na milane par party se naata todakar chunaav ladaa tha
 The BJP is trying to take power with these mlas
 haryana ke chunaav parinaam aane ke baad ab sabaki nazren sarkaar ke gathan kii ore lagi hai
 While the Congress is trying to move ahead with the anti-bjp parties, the BJP has confidence in the independents
 banate-bigadate satta ke samikarnon ke saath jald hi sthit or saaf ho jaaegi

 a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@itssapnachoudhary_) on Aug 15, 2018 at 10:54pm PDT Within six days, 20 soldiers died, that too on the law of control, but not in cross-border shelling but because of icy storms and avalanches
 sunakar vishwaas nahin hota lekin yahi sachai he
 It is also not that there will be no more deaths due to snowfall on the loc
 sena kii maane to wo kisi bhi haalat main apni chaowkee nahin chhod sakate bhale hi isaki keemat unhen jaan ganvaa kar chukaani pade
 The reason why the army cannot believe Pakistan under any sunset is because once believed during Kargil, the cost of paying about 600 soldiers had to be paid
 aapako ye bataa den ki kargil jang yani ki 1999 se pehle bharat or pakistan kii sena thand ke dinon main ek duusare par bharosa karke durgam ilaakon kii oonchi chowkiyaan har saal khaali kar diya karti thi lekin jabase pakistan ne dhokhaa diya tab se bhartiya sena ne apni chowkiyaan khaali karnaa band kar diya
 Now, if we talk about Gurez, there is a road closure since December due to snowfall
 vahaan pahunchane kaa ek maatr jariya hota he helicopter
 This is because due to terrible snowfall, only snow mountains are seen all around
 puri kii puri seemaayi chowkiyaan barf ke neeche dab jaati hai
 On January 25, the entire party of the army, which went to patrol the Neeru post of Gurez, was hit by avalanche and no one could be saved
 somvaar ko jab mausam saaf hua to in javaanon kaa shav srinagar laayaa ja sakaa
 Not only this, on January 28, five soldiers arrived in Machil sector of Kupwara due to snowfall
 badi mushkil se in javaanon ko bachaaya ja sakaa, lekin mausam kharaab hone kii vajah se do din unhen vishesh ilaaj ke liye srinagar nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 Today, when brought to Srinagar, his life could not be saved
 kargil jang ke baad se sena ko aise post par kabja banaae rakhana bahut baari pad rahaa he
 It is not only expensive but also the lives of many soldiers are lost every year
 tippaniyan It is also not that only the Indian Army has such a problem but the Pakistani Army is also facing such a problem
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik paak sena ne bhartiya sena se phir se kaha he ki wo kargil se pehle vaale maukhik samjhaute lagu kare jiske tahat donon mulkon kii senaayen sardi ke mausam main neeche ke post par chali jaati thi
 But the Army says that the Pakistan Army has a history that it has been breaking even written agreements, so what can be the condition of oral agreements, it can only be guessed
 bataaya jaataa he ki pakistani sena bhi aisi hi paristhitiyon se jujh rahi he
 According to one information, the Pakistan Army has urged the Indian Army to re-implement such verbal agreements several times after the ceasefire, but the Indian Army is not ready for this at all
 ab agar gurej kii baat karen to vahaan par disambar ke baad se barfbaari kii vajah se sadak maarg band ho jaataa he
 The only way to get there is by helicopter
 aisa isliye kyonki bhayanak barfbaari ke kaaran chaaron ore sirf barf ke pahaad hi najar aate hai
 The entire border posts are buried under snow
 gurej ke niru post par 25 janvari ko petrol karne gayi sena kii puri party himaskhalan kii chapet main aa gai or kisi ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 When the weather cleared on Monday, the bodies of these soldiers could be brought to Srinagar
 itnaa hi nahin, 28 janvari ko kupwada ke machhil sector main barfbaari kii jad me paanch jawan aa gaye
 With great difficulty these soldiers could be saved, but due to bad weather, they could not be brought to Srinagar for special treatment for two days
 aaj jab srinagar laayaa gaya to unki jaan bachaai nahin ja saki
 Since the Kargil war, it is very heavy for the army to retain such post
 ye sirf kharchila hi nahin he balki har saal kai javaanon kii jaane bhi chali jaati hai
 The comments aisa bhi nahin he ki keval bhartiya sena ke saamne aisi dikkat he balki pakistani sena bhi aisi pareshaani se jujh rahi he
 According to information received from the sources, the Pakistan Army has again asked the Indian Army to implement the verbal agreement before Kargil under which the armies of both the countries used to go to the post below in the winter season
 lekin sena kaa kahana he ki paak sena kaa itihaas rahaa he ki vah likhit samjhauton ko bhi todatii ai he to maukhik samjhauton kii kya haalat hogi, iskaa to bas andaja hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 It is said that the Pakistani Army is also struggling with similar situations
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik, paak sena ne sijafire ke baad kai baar aise maukhik samjhauton ko phir se lagu karne kaa aagrah bhartiya sena se kiya he par bhartiya sena iske liye katai raji nahin he
 It is also not that only the Indian Army has such a problem but the Pakistani Army is also facing such a problem
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik paak sena ne bhartiya sena se phir se kaha he ki wo kargil se pehle vaale maukhik samjhaute lagu kare jiske tahat donon mulkon kii senaayen sardi ke mausam main neeche ke post par chali jaati thi

 Al Qaeda leader Osama continues to dominate US politics even a year after his death
 america main raashtrapati chunaav ke liye republican party ke sambhavit ummidavaar mit romany ne jahaan raashtrapati baraak obama par is mudde ko lekar raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya he, vahiin obama ne isse inkaar kiya he
 On the other hand, American analysts say that terrorism has not ended yet and Pakistan still remains a base of terrorism
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki uttari africa or madhya purv ke deshon main aatankwaad bad rahaa he
 The death of Osama's death marked a year before the war between Obama and Romney began when Obama, in a web ad related to presidential campaigning, questioned whether Romney also showed similar work from the Oval Office
 Can? In response, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Soll said Obama is doing cheap politics on Osama's death
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf romany kii nitiyon ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 Reacting to this, Obama said on Monday that the decision taken against Osama was absolutely clear
 unhone jo kaha tha, use kar dikhaaya
 Meanwhile, Richard N
, president of the Council on Foreign Relations
 haas ne kaha ki osama kaa maaraa janaa vaishvik aatankwaad ke khilaaf ek badi jeet he
 But two realities need to be remembered
 pehali to yah ki aatankwaad kaa vikendrikaran ho gaya he or doosraa yah ki pakistan main ab bhi kuch khatarnaak aatankwaadiyon ne sharan le rakhi he or pakistan aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh main bahut kam bhagidaari nibhaa rahaa he
 Former US intelligence agency CIA official Brush Reidel agrees, "osama's death is a setback for Al Qaeda, but terrorism is still a threat to the world
" yah beshak rakshaatmak ho gaya he, lekin abhi yah parajeet nahin hua he
 Another former CIA officer, Reuel Mark Gerech, also agreed, "I don't think Osama's death will affect the upcoming plans of the jihadists of Pakistan and Afghanistan

 apane is faisle main court ne rajyapalon par bhi mahatvapurn tippanee kii he
 In its 331-page judgment on Arunachal, the Supreme Court has made these important remarks: 1) Governors cannot act on their own accord, bypassing the constitutional provisions and the rules of business of the Legislative Assembly
 rajyapal apni marji se kabhi bhi or kahin bhi vidhansabha kaa satr nahin bula sakate
 2) Under the Constitution, the Governor acts on the advice of the Cabinet
 lekin is maamle main rajyapal ne cabinet kii salaah kii upeksha kar apni marji se faisla liya
 3) If the circumstances of the state were such where the Governor did not feel right to accept the advice of the Cabinet, then he should have taken the matter to the President
 lekin unhone akele faisla liya
 4) If the governor felt that the state government did not have the support of the legislators, he could have asked him to prove his majority in the assembly
 lekin unhone apni taraf se vidhansabha kaa satr bulaakar spikar ke khilaaf prastaav par charchaa ko kaha
 5) The governor should not be a part of political controversy

 India face Pakistan on Sunday in the Champions Trophy
 bharat ke khilaaf jeetne ke liye taras rahe pakistan kii team har daanv ajama rahi he
 In the recent times, Pakistan has lost its senses due to the way Team India is showing the game led by Virat
 isliye vah team ke har khilaadi par daanv ajama rahaa he
 To stop Virat Kohli, he first tried to create a bogey in the name of fast bowler Junaid Khan
 itnaa hi nahin junayd khan ne bayaan diya ki viraat kohli bhale hi duniya ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj hon lekin chaar maichon main unhone teen baar viraat ko out kiya he
 But this mentally strong team India has no effect because Junaid was not technically very strong when he dismissed Kohli but in the last 2 years, Virat has overcome all his weaknesses
 
 ab unki ballebaaji dekh kar aisa lagata he ki viraat sirf apni hi galati par out ho sakate hai
 The comments vahiin pakistan ne ab nayaa shigupha choda he
 After the practice match against Bangladesh, Pakistan's media has started to consider 23-year-old allrounder player Faheem Ashraf as the biggest trump card
 shanivaar ko bangladesh ne abhyaas match main pakistan ke gendbaajon kii dhajjiyaan uda rakhkar rakh deen or 341 ranon kaa lakshya de daalaa
 In pursuit of such a big goal, Pakistan's team started to falter and its 8 wickets fell
 lekin fahim ashraf ne 30 gendon 4 chaukon or 4 chhakkon markar 64 ran banaae or pakistan ko jeet dilaa di
 During his innings, Hasan Ali also scored 27 runs in 15 balls with the help of two fours and a six
 iske baad se fahim ashraf ko pakistan ne hero maan liya he or use 'vander bvoy' kaha ja rahaa he
 In Pakistan's domestic cricket, Faheem has been known as a fast bowler, but in a match, he surprised everyone by hitting a century
 vah gharelu cricket main ab tak 1207 ran bana chuke hai or 94 wicket bhi khate main hai
 The Champions Trophy will be his first international match
 lekin maansik rup se behad majboot team india par iskaa koi asar nahin padataa dikhaai diya he kyonki junayd ne jab kohli ko out kiya tha to vah takneekee rup se bahut majboot nahin the lekin pichley 2 saalon main viraat ne apni sabhi kamajoriyon ko dur kar liya he
 Now looking at his batting, it seems that Virat can be out only on his own fault
 tippaniyan At the same time, Pakistan has left a new Shigufa
 bangladesh ke khilaaf abhyaas match ke baad pakistan kii media 23 saal ke olerounder khilaadi fahim ashraf ko hi sabase bada turup kaa ikkaa maanane lagi he
 On Saturday, Bangladesh kept the Pakistani bowlers flying in the practice match and set a target of 341 runs
 itane bade lakshya kaa peechha karne utari pakistan kii team ladkadaane lagi or uske 8 wicket gir gaye
 But Faheem Ashraf scored 64 runs by hitting 30 balls 4 fours and 4 sixes and gave Pakistan the victory
 unki is pari ke dauraan hasan ali ne bhi 15 gendon main do chauke or ek chakke kii madad se 27 ranon kii pari kheli
 Since then, Faheem Ashraf has been considered as a hero by Pakistan and is being called 'wonder Boy'
 pakistan ke gharelu cricket main fahim ko tej gendbaaj ko taur par janaa jaataa rahaa he lekin ek match main unhone shatak markar sabko hairat main daal diya
 He has so far scored 1207 runs in domestic cricket and also has 94 wickets in the account

 san 2010 main ise badhaane kaa prastaav rajya sarkaar ko bheja gaya tha jiske tahat ab mumbai ke parshadon kaa mehtaanaa pratimah 25 hajaar rupee hoga
 The rest of the metros will also see an increase

 aise main logon kii samasya sulajhane ke liye kaafii mehnat kerani padati he
 In such a case, the councilor has no other source of income
 jis vajah se use ek sammanjanak mehtaanaa milanaa chahie
 Significantly, during the recent government in Maharashtra, the wages of mlas were increased from Rs 75 thousand to Rs 1
5 lakh every month
 jabaki purv vidhayakon kaa pension pratimah 40 hajaar rupee kiya gaya he
 In Maharashtra, there has been a hierarchical classification of metropolitan municipalities, under which the wages have been fixed from 10 thousand rupees to 25 thousand rupees

 unhone bataaya ki patna main 80 fisadi machhlee andhra pradesh se supplai hoti he
 In such a situation, if the sale of fish in Andhra Pradesh is banned, then it will affect the entire fish traders
 unka bada nuksaan hoga

 Not only this, the traders association can also take shelter of the court against this decision

 It affects the digestive system of a person
 isse pet dard se lekar diaria tak hota he
 There is also a risk of getting cancer including serious kidney and liver diseases
 "machhlee ko sadane se bachaata he formolin
 
 
 a fish trader said that in fact, the formoline is used to protect the fish from rotting
 unhone kaha ki andhra pradesh se aani vaali machhliyaan vaise to barf main rakhkar laai jaati rahi hai
 But when these fish are packed, traders are not aware of them
 vahiin, patna ke raja bazaar ke machhlee gali ke vyapaaree sundar sahani bataate hai ki formolin kaa istemaal karne kii khabar jab se ai he log machhliyaan nahin kharid rahe hai
 The worst effect has been on the fish coming from Andhra Pradesh
