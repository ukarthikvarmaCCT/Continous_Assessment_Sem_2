 The US attack on Syrian government air bases following a chemical attack has led to confrontation between the US and Russia
 america syria ke jis ilaake main hamale kar rahaa he, vahaan par syrian suraksha balon ke saath roosi sena bhi maujuud he
 In such a situation, there is every possibility of Russian security forces being killed in the US attack
 isse pehle roosi rajdoot syria par hamale ke khilaaf america ko cheta chuke hai
 The statement issued by the Pentagon said that the US military was vigilant about the Russian and Syrian security forces
 america kii koshish he ki is hamale main ilaake main maujuud roosi or syrian surakshakarmiyon ko kam se kam nuksaan pahunche
 More than 100 people have died in this chemical attack, while more than 400 people have been injured
 vahiin, america videsh mantri jald hi rus kaa daura karne vaale hai
 The purpose of his visit is to improve relations between the US and Russia
 US ne kaha-hamale kii de di thi jaankaree, rus ne nakarasirian sarkaar ke hawaii thikaanon par hamale ke baad america ne kaha ki hamale ke pehle rus ko isaki jaankaree de di gai thi
 However, Russia says that the US has not taken its consent
 iskejavaab main americane kaha ki usne rus ko hamalaa shuru karne kii jaankaree di he, lekin usko rus se manjuuri lene kii jarurat nahin he
 Russia said that this attack by the US will make it difficult to eliminate the world's most dreaded terrorist organization Islamic State (IS)
 syrian raashtrapati par chemical atake kaa aropmangalvaar ko syria ke idlib main huechemical atacke liye america ne syrian raashtrapati ko jimmedaar tehraaya he, jabaki rus syrian raashtrapati bashar al-asad kaa khuleam samarthan kar rahaa he
 He also supported Bashar in the UN Security Council, which has led to worldwide criticism of Russia
 rus or syrian raashtrapati ne vidrohi guton par lagaaya aropasyrian raashtrapati bashar al-asad or rus nechemical atake karneke america ke aarope ko sire se khaarij kiya he
 Russia and Assad say rebel groups have carried out this chemical attack
 is hamale ke baad se rus or america ke bich pehle se hi tikhi jubaani jang jari he
 In such a situation, the tension has been deepened by the US firing 60 cruise missiles
 trump ke aane ke baad bhi nahin sudharenge america-rus rishtesyria ko lekar purv america raashtrapati baraak obama ke shashan ke dauraan rus or america ke rishte behad bighad gaye the, lekin donald trump kii roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin ke najdiki hone ke baad yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki ab donon deshon ke rishte behatar honge, lekin syria main chemical atake ke baad yah ummid dhundhlee hoti dikh rahi he
 Since the chemical attack, relations between the two countries have become tense again due to Trump's changed stance
 america shuru se hi asad ko syria kii satta se bedakhal karne ke paksh main he, jabaki rus asad kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Russia has been continuously carrying out air strikes on Syrian rebels and IS militants on behalf of Assad
 america saansadon ne trump kaa kiya samarthanasyria par chemical atake ke baad sainya karrwai karne ke america raashtrapati donald trump ke aadesh kii america main jamkar saraahna ho rahi he

 Team India is going to tour Australia in January
 vahaan use 5 vanade or teen tii-20 mukaable khilne hai
 Meanwhile, there is a possibility that the captaincy of the Australian team against Team India can be handed over to David Warner, not Steven Smith
 australia ke captain smith ko hip or takhne main chot lagi he or westeindies ke khilaaf ho rahi test siries ke baad hi aanka jayega ki wo kitne feet hai
 But it is believed that keeping in mind the upcoming T20 World Cup, the Australian selectors will not want to further aggravate Captain Smith's injury
 isi ke maddenjar smith ne khud ko australia kii mashhoor big bash lig se alag kar liya he or usamen nahin khelenge
 The comments australia ke coach deran liman kaa maananaa he ki smith abhi 26 saal ke hai, lekin maidan par aise daud rahe hai jaise ki 36 saal ke hon
 They are very important for the future of Australia and we have to give them rest at the right time
 in sabake bich david warner ko bharat ke khilaaf kaman mil sakati he jo is akramak baayen haath ke ballebaaj ke liye ek nayaa hi anubhav hoga
 When Team India went on an Australian tour last year, Warner got involved on the field with India's captain Virat Kohli and some other members on several occasions
 aise main unako kaman milane par yah daura rochak ho saktaa he
 Australia captain Smith has suffered a hip and ankle injury and will be judged only after the Test series against the West Indies
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale tii-20 vishwa-cap ko dhyaan main rakhte hue australian chayankarta nahin chahenge ki captain smith kii chot or bade
 In view of this, Smith has separated himself from Australia's famous Big Bash League and will not play in it
 tippaniyan Australia coach Deron Lehman believes Smith is 26 years old, but is running on the field like a 36-year-old
 wo australia ke bhavishya ke liye behad ahm hai or hamen unhen sahi samay par aaraam dena padegaa
 Amidst all this, David Warner can get a command against India, which will be a new experience for this aggressive left-handed batsman
 pichley saal jab team india australian daure par gai thi, tab warner kai maukon par bharat ke captain viraat kohli or kuch anya sadasyon ke saath maidan par ulajh gaye the
 In such a situation, this tour can be interesting if they get command

 zyada kaa vakt biit chukaa he lekin asaram baapu kii museebataan khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Asaram, who claims to have got rid of people from their difficulties, has been entangled in the problems of his own problems today, and so too does the practice of sadhana or any tantra-matra
 bhavasaagar main apane bhakton kii naiya ko paar lagane vaale asaram aaj khud court kii tarikhon ke bhavar main ulajh kar rahe gaye hai
 Asaram's entire family is stung by the poison of sin
 chatapata rahaa he
 Now there is no sorcery going on
 naa tantra mantra ki sadhana
 The wind of the God of hypocrisy has blossomed
 asaram ne apane ateet main badanaami, besharmi or kukarmon ke jo kaante boe the, ab wo khun chus rahe hai
 Day, night, in the changing jails of the prison, all night in open-eye windows, repeated bail pleas, Ahmedabad police transit remand
 asaram ne ekantavaas kaa jo baikunth banaaya tha wo ekantavaas ab asaram ke kunbe ke liye agyatavaas ban gaya he
 Asaram is hidden in the bill by not knowing the whole family by applying the vaccine of hypocrisy
 baba kaa kunba faraar he or paapon se pardaa ughadta hi ja rahaa he
 Sometimes with allegations of rape and sexual exploitation, sometimes with big revelations of a hut of hypocrisy
 asaram and family par aarope lagane vaali ladakiyon kii sankhya badhati hi ja rahi he
 Everyday, some girl is coming up with sensational allegations
 to asaram ke ashramon se ghinauni sachai saamne aa rahi he
 Sometimes by becoming a shameless disease, now by becoming a shameless herb
 asaram ke ashram se niklaa rahasy pehle asaram kii dhyaan kutiyaa kaa raaj baahar aayaa to koharaam much gaya
 But now you will be surprised to hear the secret that has come out of his ashram
 food and drug vibhaag ke ek chaape ke dauraan asaram ke ashram se aisi dawaaon kaa bhandar mila he jo sex vardhak maani jaati hai
 The Food and Drug Department also says that the chemicals caught in Asaram's ashram use such chemicals, which they have not been allowed
 do bahanon ke rape or yon shoshan ke iljaam ke baad surat kii police asaram ke ashramon red maar rahi he
 Asaram's clan may not have been found in the police raid yet, but the Food and Drug Department has got the Besharam herb in the ashram of Surat
 duniyabar main gum ghumkar bhagavat bhakthi kii baaten karne vaale asaram par pehle bersham beemaari yani peedophilia hone kaa iljaam laga
 The pedophilio, after being victimized, the person loves to have physical relations with children and now the secret of Besharam herb is revealed from Asaram's ashram
 asaram ke ashram main aisi dawaaon kaa bhandar tha
 Which are considered as sex enhancers
 asaram ke ashram se jo besaram booti mili he, uskaa naam he sapt dhaatu vardhak booti
 The Food and Drug Department also says that the chemicals caught in Asaram's ashram use such chemicals, which they have not been allowed
 asaram ke surat main jahangirpur ashram se chhapemari main, naa sirf shakti vardhak dawaaen mili hai balki 5 duusari aisi dawaaen bhi mili hai jinke chemical par food and drug vibhaag ko shaq he or un dawaaon ke naam hai- baan booti, trifala tablet, aanwala churna, kaph syrup or rasayan tablet
 The Food and Drug Department has sent samples of suspected and sex-enhancing drugs from Asaram's ashram for investigation
 yani baba ke liye shakti vardhak booti afat vardhak booti ban sakati he
 The whole family is accused of Asaram and his entire family is surrounded by allegations of sexual exploitation of girls
 kya betaa narayan sai, kya beti bharti or kya patni lakshmi
 Everyone is facing serious allegations
 lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki duniya ko satya or ahimsa kaa paath padhaane vaala asaram kaa puraa parivaar, khud par aarope lagane ke baad se hi gaayab he or police un sabhi kii talash main khaak chaan rahi he
 Sachnarayan Sai of Asaram's family made a big argument for Asaram's innocence
 unako jal kii salaakhon se baahar laane kii har mumkin koshish kii
 But Narayan could not succeed in his attempt
 awwal khud un par hi balaatkaar kaa sangeen aarope lag gaya or jaise hi police ne unke khilaaf lukout notice jari kiya wo bhi faraar ho gaye
 Bharti herself has gone missing after Asaram's daughter Bharti Asaram and Narayan Sai were accused of rape and the girls were named in a sexual abuse case
 sirf betaa-beti hi nahin balki asaram kii patni lakshmi bhi gaayab hai
 He is also accused of accompanying Asaram in Rasleela
 
 
 asaram kii patni lakshmi par aarope he ki wo asaram tak ladkiyaan pahunchane kaa intjaam karti thim
 Not only the manner of executing the act, but also the tactics to avoid the law after the charges were leveled by Narayan Sai, which was chosen by his father Asaram
 
 
 lekin lagata he ki kaanoon se bachane ke liye asaram or unka puraa parivaar ab khud hi apni bichaai bisaat main buree tarah ghir chukaa he
 Asaram will have to spend a few more days in jail
 jodhpur court ne gujarat police ko asaram kii transit remand de di he

 Bulk vote vote against indifferent public representatives will not mean boycotting the election nor pressing the NOTA option in evms
 kyonki isse chunaav ladane vaale vidhayak par koi asar nahin padataa
 The strategy of the farmers is to stop voting for the public representatives who have not paid attention to their demands

 Bigg Boss-10 is going to start from today
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi salmaan khan sho ko host kar rahe hai, or weekend main apana jalawaa dikhaaenge
 But due to the weak celebrities who came to the Bigg Boss house last time, the style of entertainment could not look like that of Bigg Boss
 salmaan khan ne kai maukon par ghar ke sadasyon ko jhaad bhi pilaai or unase sho kii kharaab tiarapy reating ke bare main bhi kaha
 While at that time the selection of baddies for the show was a reason for the TRP to fall behind, the one coming on Colors, the other show was moving fast and from its launch day it was making number one on TRP
 
 ye shomauni roy kaa ichhadhari nagin par aadhaarit nagintha
 The show remained at number one in the TRP race from day one

 When Naagin Mouni Roy came on the show, Salman told the house members that Naagin is also ahead of you in the race for TRP
 naginako aage hona bhi tha kyonki ekta kapur ke is sho main kalpana ke ghode khub daudaaye gaye the, or kisse-kahaniyon kaa sara masala bharaa gaya tha
 While the children were having quarrels in the Big Boss house, the members of the house were spitting each other and drinking
 matlab ghar ke sadsy us str par utar gaye the jisamen manoranjan shunya ho gaya tha, or tuchhi apane charam par thi
 Salman was also surprised to see these antics on the show
 sho main saare task kalesh main tabdeel hokar khatm ho jate the
 Now Salman Khan is once again present with his team, and Udharanagin has come to Shivanaki's daughter Shivangi who is himself a wishful serpent
 is baar bhi kahani ne nae mode lenaa shuru kar die hai
 On the other hand, new experiments are being done in Bigg Boss house
 aam aadmi ko bhi ghar kaa hissaa banaaya gaya he
 It has to be seen that if the old raga in the name of entertainment is repeated in the house of Bigg Boss, will it be good for Salman's image and show? hathras main itiai kii pravesh pariksha ke liye abhyarthiyon ko pravesh patr dene main paison kii vasuuli kaa maamla saamne aayaa he

 ---input IANS se After the elections in five states, the talks between the Samajwadi Party and the BSP have started in UP for the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ko lekar abhi bhram he ki vah iskaa hissaa hogi yaa nahin, lekin siyasat ke jaankaar kehete hai ki teen rajyon main congress kii jeet ke baad bane maahaul main gathbandhan main congress kaa hona phydemand he
 Analysts believe that if these three parties come together, it can pose a tough challenge for the BJP
 samaajawaadee party main chunaav ke maddenjar sammelnon kaa silsilaa jari he
 The organization's work has been going on long before the alliance was made
 sanghathan ke har hisse ko kaam par lagaaya ja rahaa he
 Akhilesh refuses to explain the alliance ahead of time
 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se jab poocha gaya ki “teen rajyon main congress ne jeet hasil kii he
 No one from your party and BSP went there


 Is the alliance in UP definitive? He said, "there is no talk on that yet
 ” samaajawaadee party ke emelsi sunil saajan kaa kahana he ki samaajawaadee party lagaataar aisa prayaas kar rahi he ki ham ek aisa gathbandhan kaa swaroop nikaalen jisase kam se kam uttar pradesh main bhartiya janata party kaa safaya ho
 The BSP contested elections in 1996 in alliance with the Congress in UP
 mayawati kahati hai ki unka vot to congress ko transfar hua lekin congress kaa unhen nahin mila
 In the last assembly election, the Samajwadi Party aligned with the Congress


 but it did not succeed as expected
 teen rajyon main congress kii jeet ke baad siyaasi maahaul badla he
 Politicians say that now there is a more forgiving atmosphere for the Congress for the alliance
 jaankaar kehete hai ki teen rajyon kii jeet ke baad agar congress zyaada siten na maange to gathbandhan se teenon dalon ko faaydaa hoga
 Rahul Gandhi's stature has grown after these elections

 peeks media research ke chunaav vishleshak shamashaad khan kehete hai ki “jo basapa kaa sabase kam percent he vah 19 percent he or sapa kaa 22 percent or congress kaa chah
 If it is added to it, it gets almost 46% votes
 
 
 47 percent ke aasapaas
 If this alliance becomes one, then out of the 73 seats BJP has in today's time, BJP will be reduced to just 15 seats

 ab tak china karata rahaa he virodhhalanki, china suraksha parishad ke vistaar kaa kadaa virodh karata rahaa he
 But according to sources, he wanted to vote on this proposal of discussion for a year on the structure of reform, but he did not get the support of other members on it, after which it did not insist on this
 isse sidhe taur par bharat kaa phayda hua
 In fact, if China were to pressurize voting, India would have had to work very hard to strengthen other members in its favor
 vahiin, america or rus ne bharat kii sadsyta kaa maukhik rup se samarthan to kiya lekin likhit taur par iskaa koi aashwaasan nahin diya
 This will be the next step

 24 disambar ko jharkhand vikaas morcha (jeviem) ke 56 varshiya pramukh babulal marandi ne ranchi se dilli kii flite pakadi kyonki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko janata dal-united (jedy-you) ke rajyasabha sadsy ke
 C
 tyaagi ke ghar par gathbandhan ko antim rup dena tha
 The JD (U) and JVM are now trying to bring Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with them after forming a formal alliance
 yah gathbandhan bhale hi nayaa ho lekin iskaa makasad purana he ki vibhajit janadesh aane par koi bhi vijeta banakar ubhar saktaa he
 Babulal Marandi, who started this alliance, has just two mps in the Lok Sabha, but his motives are high
 marandi kaa yah vishwaas hawa main hi nahin balki isaki vajah in chaar rajyon ko milaane se milane vaali loksabhaa siton kii sankhya he
 Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha have 117 Lok Sabha seats, which is more than one-fifth of the total number of Lok Sabha seats
 is samay trinmul congress (tiemasi), biju janata dal (bijedy), janata dal-united or jeviem ko milakar kul 55 saansad hai
 "in 2014, this number may increase further," says Marandi
 ham pehle se zyada siten hasil kar sakate hai
 Marandi, the school teacher, became the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand in November 2000 about 13 years ago
 ve gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke nafe-nuksaan se bakhubi parichit hai
 In March 2003, he was forced to step down as BJP chief minister as coalition partners revolted against him
 aise main bijepi ne unka saath dene kii bajaae unki jagah arjuna munda ko kursi saunp di thi
 Marandi left the party in May 2006 and formed a new party called JVM
 rochak baat he ki us samay unhen mukhyamantri ke pad se hataane main sahyog dene vaale chaar mantri tatkaaleen samta party ke the, jo apane party ke varisht netaa nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane jate the
 The Samata Party was merged with JD (U) in October 2003
 marandi kehete hai, ‘‘samay pehle se badal gaya he
 Now you can no longer be a frog of a well
 ’’marandi or nitish main kareebi hone kii vajah yah he ki donon kaa congress or bijepi se mohabhang ho chalaa he
 Both leaders want to stay away from national parties
 marandi ne 2006 main bijepi se naata tod liya tha or nitish ne 2013 main
 The Congress has rejected Nitish for supporting Lalu Prasad Yadav
 udhar, 2009 main congress ke saath milakar jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav ladgaye kaa marandi kaa anubhav bhi acha nahin rahaa
 The party gave him only 25 seats, out of which Marandi won 11
 baad main congress ne marandi kaa saath chhodkar jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) ke shibu sorain se haath mila liya
 Soren has been a fierce opponent of Marandi
 sambhawatah loksabhaa chunaav ke baad astitv main aane vaale tisare morche ke vipareet marandi chauthe morche kaa gathan chunaav se pehle karne kii koshishon main jute hai
 "formalities related to this alliance are yet to be prepared, including the allocation of seats," he says
 ’’koi rashtriya agenda na hone se unhen phayda hi he kyonki chaaron partiyaan apane-apane rajyon main hi chunaav ladengi or ek-duusare ke bich koi takaraav nahin rahegaa
 Before the elections, their emphasis will be on getting their traditional votes to their alliance partners
 jharkhand main marandi kii party jeviem ke paas loksabhaa main do or vidhansabha main 11 siten hai, yah jedy (you) ke saath milakar apana koiri-kurmi vot bank majboot karnaa chaahati he
 JD (U) has two mlas in Jharkhand
 iske badale main marandi bihar main adivasee vot jedy (you) ke paksh main dilaane kii koshish karenge
 Nitish may not benefit much in terms of votes, but by bringing a tribal leader like Marandi with him, he will be able to improve his declining image of a leader of mass support
 marandi pakke iraadon vaale shaks hai
 Despite the image of an impeccable and efficient ruler, he could not complete his five-year term as Chief Minister
 ve is saal apni adhuri ichha kii purti karne kaa avasar hasil kar sakate hai
 Marandi, who belongs to an ordinary family, has graduated in geography
 unhone 1981 main skool adhyaaapak kii naukari isliye chhod di, kyonki unka vetan dene ke liye ek clerk unase rishwat maang rahaa tha
 He says, "I quit a government job because if i had to pay a bribe to get my salary, i would have to compromise my self-esteem
" maine bijepi chhod di kyonki uske saath rahane se main logon ke vishwaas ke saath dhokhaa karata
 "marandi has demonstrated his steely intentions many times
 ve jharkhand ke kuch gine-chune netaaon main se hai, jinhone khulkar maovadiyon kaa virodh kiya he
 That is why the Maoists attacked and killed his son during a cultural event in Giridih in 2007 and his brother somehow escaped
 2003 main maovadiyon ne marandi ke kafile par hamalaa kiya tha, lekin ve batch gaye
 Marandi joined BJP in 1981
 iske dashak bhar baad unhone dumka nirvachan kshetra se shibu sorain ke khilaaf loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa tha
 Marandi suffered a heavy defeat in that election by 1,34,000 votes
 1996 main ve dobaaraa shibu sorain ke khilaaf lade or is baar bhi haar gaye, lekin sirf 6,000 voton se
 He eventually won the Lok Sabha elections from Dumka in 1998 and 1999
 in donon chunaavon main unhone pehle shibu sorain ko or phir unki patni rupi sorain ko haraaya tha
 He was made Minister of State for Environment and Forests in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 ek saal baad november, 2000 main jab bihar kaa vibhaajan karke jharkhand bana to ve rajya ke pehle mukhyamantri bane
 When four mlas who joined his party returned to the BJP before the 2009 assembly elections, people had assumed that Marandi had reached the margins of politics
 lekin jeviem ne 81 siton vaali vidhansabha main 28 pratishat voton ke saath 11 siten hasil kin
 If he could not form the government, it was only because he contested a total of 25 seats and left the remaining 56 seats for his coalition partner Congress
 lekin congress kaa pradarshan bahut niraashajanak rahaa tha
 Marandi has learned his lesson
 in anubhavon ke baad unhone 2014 ke liye apni yojana taiyaar kar lee he or ve pehle se zyada saavdhaan ho gaye hai

 - Input IANS internet ke agrani search ingine google kaa kahana he ki varisht america adhikariyon, sainya adhikariyon, patrakaron or chini raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ke jimail khaaton ko nishaanaa bana kar ek sibar jasusi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he or is abhiyaan kaa mul strot china main he
 Eric Gross, director of Google's security team, said in a post posted on his blog on Wednesday, "recently we came to know of a campaign that has been conducted to collect users' passwords

 unhone kaha ki is abhiyaan ke prabhaviton main varisht america adhikari, chini raajnneetik kaaryakarta, sainya adhikari, patrkaar or khaas taur par dakshin korea sahit kai asian deshon ke adhikari shaamil hai

 An engineering student died of drowning in Telangana's twin city of Cyberabad
 mritak chaatr apane doston ke saath nahaane ke liye jhil main utraa tha
 Friends are accused that during the accident, they were making a video of the incident instead of saving the deceased student
 police ne is maamle main mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 The incident is from the Hayatnagar area of cyberabad
 mritak chaatr kaa naam manoj kumaar tha
 According to the police, the deceased student Manoj came to meet another friend Aditya here on Friday along with his 4 friends
 sabhi chaatr alag-alag collejon se ejineering kii padhai kar rahe hai
 After meeting Aditya, all the friends decided to take a bath in a nearby lake
 nahaate vakt manoj gahare pani main utar gaya or vah doobane laga
 Manoj's friends say that he made a lot of efforts to save Manoj, but those people could not save Manoj
 is dauraan uske doston ne mobile se ghatana kavideobhi banaaya
 Friends are accused of trying to make videos instead of saving Manoj during the incident
 police ne gotakhoron kii madad se manoj ke shav ko jhil se baahar nikaal liya he
 The police have registered a case in this case and started investigation
 'khamosh' 
 Nobody said this
 bas maahaul hi aisa tha 
 Quiet silence
 rahul gandhi chhotevaale couch par baithe hue the
 a red colored cube stool was placed next to the bean bag
 rahul ko is par aksar study lamp rakhana acha lagata he
 At that time a girl was sitting there
 rahul ke saath ladki ko dekh log hairaan ho uthe
 Sonia was shocked to see the girl, 'she!' a lot of pressure came out of his mouth
 sonia hi nahin balki baaki log bhi aashcharyachakit the, wo ladki bhi
 Rahul knew that this would happen
 wo yun hi khamosh or shant rahe
 If anyone was the most comfortable among the people present, then she was Priyanka
 'yaa
 
 
 Mama, Xi
 ' haa main sir hilaate priyanka kii ye baat or hairaan karanevaali thi
 With this ease of Priyanka, Sonia understood that it is not what she sees
 ladki sonia ko ekatak dekhe ja rahi thi
 At times, Priyanka would have lost sight of Rahul's face as well
 uske liye hairaani kii baat ye thi ki aakhir sonia ko uske bare main kaise pataa? rahul ne sonia ko is bare main kuch bhi nahin bataaya tha
 The girl knew this
 sirf priyanka ko uske bare main pataa tha
 There was talk of Sonia also, but neither did she ask where Rahul is - nor did Rahul mention this
 sonia is baat se bephikr thim ki lalu ji ne rahul ke liye jo kuch plan kiya he usase behatar unke liye haal philhal to kuch bhi nahin sujh rahaa tha
 Priyanka did not like keeping Sonia in suspense for too long
 phir priyanka ne bataaya ki ladki koi or nahin balki rahul kii interprator he
 She agreed to Sonia because she was named 'she'
 china mul kii shi kii padhai likhaai landan main hui jiske baad usne america se sin language main diploma kiya
 Xi received the first assignment in Thailand, but it was discovered on the way that the client's trip had been canceled
 isi bich rahul kii team unke liye ek interprator khoj rahi thi
 Contact was made by viewing Xi's profile via Facebook - and the matter was confirmed
 rahul vaise hi chupchaap baithe hue the
 There was no anger at all in the face
 aas paas fate hua kaagaj yaa uske tukade bhi nahin najar aa rahe the
 Further story was told by Shea, some of whom also knew Sonia
 rahul gandhi political study live par janaa to chaahate the, lekin desh se baahar nahin
 He was looking for a place where there was a natural environment
 shanti jarur ho
 For this, people who were nearby were also like minded
 kisi ne bengalooru kaa nechuropathy centre to kisi ne hyderabad kaa centre sajest kiya
 One even suggested the Patanjali Yoga Peeth of Haridwar
 sabake sab riject kar die gaye
 Someone advised Vipassana for introspection, but that course ends in 10 days, so he auto-rejects
 is mashwara meeting main lalu yadav bhi baithe hue the
 Lalu suggested the name of Bihar's Munger Yoga Peeth - and it was finalized immediately
 munger yoga peeth main rahul ne 'maun vrath' kaa khaasaa abhyaas kiya
 They started enjoying it a lot
 phir unhen ek aise shaks kii jarurat samaj ai jo unke mook sanvaadon ko dusron ke liye shabd de sake
 Rahul was then advised to learn sign language
 desh main rah kar ise siikhnaa isliye mushkil lag rahaa tha kyonki isamen khalal padane kii ashanka thi
 In between, Rahul also kept talking
 shi rahul kii bhaawanaaon ko shabd detii rahi, 'aisa isliye kiya kyonki ye mama kaa fevorett he
 "mama, night after day - and day after night the cycle goes on
" ye kudarat kaa niyam he
 The same rule applies in politics
 ek chup pradhanmantri ke baad desh ko ek bolta piem mila he
 Now it is the turn of the silent PM once again
 taaki raajnneetik sristi kii ye satat prakriya chalati rahe
 "silence has permanence, mama
" khamoshi hajaar shabdon par baari padati he
 'my silence is better than thousands of answers, i don't know how many questions have been kept'
 ye sunakar tumne kaise thahaake lagaae the, mama
 After all, how many times has this happened when you have laughed out loud
 ''mama, jo tum kahogi vahi karuunga
 But be quiet agar main aapako khush kar paaya to mere liye ye sabase badi khushi hogi
 On the gestures of Rahul, Shea explained to Sonia
 sonia behad chintit najar aa rahi thim
 The tension on his face was increasing
 aisa dekh priyanka bhi thodaa gambhir ho gayi
 Then Xi told one such thing that everyone's faces changed on hearing
 rahul ji ne hafte main sirf ek din maun vrath rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 But for this, they would need Mama's approval
 ye sunate hi sonia puri tarah sahaj ho gayi, isliye priyanka bhi
 Then someone came and told that Digvijay has come, wants to meet
 sabhi log uth khadey hue
 She also joined him after getting Rahul's gesture
 asal main, digvijay ji sin language main bhi maahir bataae jate hai
 She could also do the work of Xi, but then how would the other work be done? kulbhushan jadhav international court main sunwaayee ke mudde par atorni general mukul rohtagi ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki bharat ko kulbhushan yadav ke maamle main safalataa milegi
 It is worth mentioning that from today on the issue of Kulbhushan Yadav is being heard in the international court
 is bare main atorni general of india mukul rohtagi ne kaha, 'bharat kaa cese acha he
 Pakistan has violated all international agreements
 vienna sandhi kaa bhi unhone ulanghan kiya he
 It is clear that he has no evidence in this case
 jo trial hui he is cese main usamen dam nahin he
 The trial took place in military court which was closed to the public
 yah apane aap jaahir karata he ki isamen dhokhadhadi he
 We have every hope, we have complete preparation
 bharat ko safalataa milegi is cese main
 On Pakistan's statement that the decision of the international court is not admissible to the military court, Mukul Rohatgi says that this statement of Pakistan is wrong
 pakistan or bharat main vienna sandhi he jis par donon ne sin kii he
 Counselor access should have been granted under this treaty
 mere hisaab se hamen puri safalataa mili chahie
 If an agreement applies to the entire country, then it will also apply to its court
 isamen koi fark nahin padataa he
 Mukul Rohatgi said that India fully hopes that Kulbhushan Jadhav will be freed from Pakistan's captivity
 unhone kaha, 'main yah bhi ummid rakhata hum international pressure kii vajah se pakistan ko samaj aa jaae ki yah kaam galat he
 He should leave Jadhav himself
 yah donon deshon ke friendli relations ke liye acha hoga
 Pakistan is wrong, if it is understood by Pakistan itself, it will be good for the relations of both countries
 'pakistan ke antarrashtriya court main shaamil hone ke mudde pachhatorni janaralaka kahana he ki pakistan isamen shaamil to jarur hoga, lekin pakistan yah jarur baat ki uske military court ke upar iskaa faisla implement nahin hoga
 The point will be that you cannot dispose against us
 ham ise nahin maanate hai
 But the court has the right to reject it and say that the decision it makes will apply to both countries
 gauratlab he ki antarrashtriya adaalat ne kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee kii sajaa par roak laga di he
 But Pakistan has refused to accept this
 uskaa kahana he ki antarrashtriya adaalat kaa faisla pakistan ke military court par maanya nahin he
 The matter is now being heard in an international court
 bharat baar-baar yahi apil kar rahaa he ki pakistan ne vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Papala was rescued while firing at the police station
 The deal was going on between the miscreants and the accused
 Police have arrested two people in the case of papala Gurjar being released from the police station in Behror, Rajasthan
 police ne aropiyon ke paas se cash bhi jabt kiya he
 However, the interesting thing is that these arrests have taken place after the police made fun of them on social media
 darasal, kukhyat badmaash papala gurjar ko bahrod police ne giraftaar kar hawalat main rakhaa tha
 32 lakh rupees were also seized from his car
 daawa he ki bahrod ke sarpanch vinod swami or kailash gurjar papala gurjar ko chhudaane ke liye thane pahunche or kuldeep gang ko thane ke bare main jaankaree di
 After this, the crooks who brought ak-47s, firing on the police station, rescued Papala
 is ghatana ne bahrod kii police par sawaal khadey kar die
 Even the police was made fun of on social media
 is puure ghatnakram ke baad bahrod road thane ke esechao sugan singh ne soshal media par likhaa ki vah na to bhrasht hai or na hi nikamme hai
 He stated in the cleanup that the pistol was jammed
 unhone chaar baar fire kiya, magar fire hi nahin hua
 After joking everywhere, the police now arrested the two accused
 police ne bahrod ke sarpanch vinod swami or kailash gurjar ko giraftaar kiya he
 Also, cash has been seized from them
 haalanki, aarope ye bhi lag rahe hai ki papala gurjar kii gaadi se baraamad cash baantne ke liye police or aropiyon main saudebaaji chal rahi thi
 It is being said that this deal could not be done and after making fun of the police everywhere, the police made arrests in this case
 karnataka main lagaataar chal rahe naatakeey ghatnakramon ke baad rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne guuruuvaar ko bijepi ke bies yediurppa ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene ke liye kaha he
 After this, all eyes are now on the floor test to be held in the assembly
 karnataka ke rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne bijepi netaa ko sadan main bahumat sabit karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya he
 Meanwhile, elections will also be held on the assembly seat of RR Nagar, where the voting could not take place on May 12
 agar is bich matganana puri ho jaati he to bahumat sabit karne ke liye bijepi ko 113 kaa aankada choona hoga
 However, the election date for the second assembly seat Jayanagar has not been announced yet
 floor test se pehle kaa testsiob sadan main hone vaale floor test se bhi zyada ahm agle vidhansabha spikar kaa chunaav ho gaya he
 The election of the new assembly speaker will decide a lot on his discretion
 bijepi or jedies-congress donon hi khemon ne agle spikar ke mudde par mantranaa shuru kar di he kyonki pehle floor test main spikar kii bhoomika ahm hogi
 On the other hand, it has become very important for the BJP that the speaker be of its choice
 bijepi ko ummid he ki yaa to vipaksh ke kuch vidhayak istipha denge yaa phir bijepi main aa jaaenge
 In this way, the bjp's majority will end with 8 seats
 ab yaheen se shuru hoti he siem yediurppa kii asli parikshabijepi sadasyon ke shapath kii taiyaariyon ke saath hi nae spikar ke chunaav kii ranneeti bananaa shuru ho gai thi
 The jds-congress will field one of its candidates for the post of speaker
 voting main sankhyabal ke maamle main 116 sadasyon ke saath congress-jedies, bijepi ke 104 par baari padenge
 How important is the role of the speaker? Opposition parties may agree on the Speaker's election, but it is unlikely to happen in the present situation
 protem spikar floor test nahin kara saktaa he, protem spikar kii niyukti nae vidhayakon ko shapath dilaane ke liye kii jaati he
 Floor tests are conducted by the selected speaker
 'anti defections lau' ke tahat shikayaton kii sunwaayee karne main bhi spikar kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 In many cases, mlas go against their party's whip and vote, but the speaker does not have the mandate to give an immediate decision
 isse pehle ke kai aise udhaaharan rahe hai jahaan spikar ne maamle par tunrat karrwai nahin kii
 Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker Keshari Nath Tripathi, speakers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana kept the case hanging
 chunki spikar ko maamle par nirnay dene ke liye kisi samay seemaa main baandhakar nahin rakhaa gaya he isliye sattarudh party kai maheenon tak power main rah sakati he
 The current Speaker of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, KB Koliwad, did not disqualify the 7 JDS mlas who had cross-voted in favor of the Congress candidate during voting in the Rajya Sabha
 ek bijepi netaa ne kaha, yahaan tak ki hai court bhi yahi kahata he ki in vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar diya janaa chahie lekin spikar maamle par hathper haath dhare baithe rahe
 Both the BJP and congress-jds camps have submitted an official letter to the governor, presenting the claim to form the government
 ek varisht congress netaa ne bataaya, aakhirkaar spikar kaa chunaav hi sabase nirnaayak hoga jo vishwaas maton kaa nirikshan karegaa
 The choice of the speaker is a kind of floor test in itself
 bijepi kaa bhi aisa hi maananaa he
 a party leader said, "we are discussing the issue of whom should we make a speaker who is seen as a right and fair person
" assam main enarasi ke mudde par congress netaa shashi tharur kii bhi pratikriya aa gai he
 He has raised the issue of NRC without naming the government
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki rabindranath tagore ne kaha tha ki rashtrawaad or videshi logon ko na pasand karne main antar hota he
 At the same time, hatred of foreign people gradually turns into hatred of Indians
 "there is a thin line between nationalism and xenophobia —besides, hatred of the foreigner could later turn into a hatred of Indians different from oneself
 "- Rabindranath Tagore
 The prescience of a great man! # NRC— Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor)august 31, 2019shashi tharur ne yah baat aise samay kahi he jab assam main enarasi kii final list jari kii gai he
 The final list of Assam's National Citizenship Register (NRC) was released on Saturday, of which about 19 lakh people were evicted
 antim suchi se 19,06,677 log nikaale gaye hai
 The list has 3,11,21,004 people as Indian citizens
 vahiin enarasi ke aankade jari hone ke baad congress ne antarim adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke awaas 10 janpath par baithak chal rahi he
 The Congress will try its best to surround the government on this issue
 lihaaja baithak main isi ko lekar ranneeti bhi banaai ja sakati he
 Senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Gaurav Gogoi are also present in this meeting
 baharhaal, jin 19 lakh logon ko enarasi list main jagah nahin mili he, unke liye ab bhi mauka he
 These people will have to appeal in the Forests Tribunal in 120 days
 assam sarkaar rajya main rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) kii antim suchi se nikaale gaye logon se sambandhit maamle dekhne ke liye 400 forenurs tribyoonles sthapit karegi

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Saturday strongly criticized the icc's decision to impose a fine on Ravindra Jadeja, saying that many things were not taken into consideration in this case and he could not ignore them if his players were abused
 jadeja ko trentbrij main england ke tej gendbaaj james anderson ke saath ghati ghatana ke liye khel bhaavana ke khilaaf aacharan karne kaa doshi paaya gaya jiske liye un par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana kiya gaya
 Dhoni said on the eve of the third Test match against England, 'personally it was a very hurtful decision for me
 is maamle main faisla karte samay kai chizon par dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 ' bhartiya captain ne trentbrij kii ghatana ke bare main bhi bataaya
 He said, 'if you see what really happened, the umpires announced lunch and we started going towards the pavilion
 main kisi anya khilaadi kaa naam nahin lenaa chahta hum
 We were leaving and another player started using profanity against Jadeja
 jab ham seemaa rekha tak pahunche tab maine sochaa ki sthiti sanbhal gai he
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'jab ham khilaadiyon ke kshetra main pahunche to main jadeja se aage tha
 He was a little behind me
 phir kuch hua
 Something was said to him and he was pushed again
 vah bamushkil apana santulan bana paaya
 He turned back to see what was happening and was fined on the ground
 ' The Indian captain said, "I don't think Jadeja would have shown even a little bit of anger and that's why i am very hurt by the decision
" ' The ICC found Jadeja guilty under Level 1 and Dhoni also considered it laughable
 unhone kaha, 'aarope level do ke lage the or jadeja ko level ek ke liye sajaa mili
 The specialty of Level 1 is that you cannot appeal against it, but the BCCI and the legal team are working on it
 ham nishchit taur par faisle se khush nahin hai
 i have told what is the truth ' Dhoni said, "if tomorrow i tell my players not to say anything on the field, then it will happen again in such a way that whatever happens, we will be fined 50 percent of the match fees
 isliye main bhi apshabdon kaa upyog kar saktaa hum kyonki anya khilaadi ke aapke liye apshabd kehane par bhi aapako 50 pratishat match fees ganvaani hi he
 ' bhartiya captain ne iske saath hi kaha ki unhone bisisiai se kaha tha ki vah nishchit taur par chaahate hai ki vah is faisle ke khilaaf apil kare

 dilli kii satta main aam aadmi party bade nuksaan kii taraf bad rahi he
 While the top leaders are worried about the election to 20 seats, the other mlas of the party are busy in deciding the strange definition of ministerial post or MLA
 49 dinon kii sarkaar ke dauraan kejariwal sarkaar main kanoon mantri rahe somnath bharti kaa kahana he ki 'aap' main mantri, vidhayak yaa sansadeey sachiv banakar sona nahin mil rahaa he
 Somnath Bharti, who arrived in the High Court to give legal support to 20 mlas, was asked if he could get the responsibility of Law Minister again in Delhi government
 iske jawaab main bharti dilachasp jawaab dete nazar aae
 He said, "the legislator to whom the party gives responsibility is discharged
 hycourt main apane saathiyon ke saath khadey hone aayaa hum
 As a lawyer, it is my duty to stand there whenever the party needs legal fight or advice
 "bataa den, sadsyta ganvaane vaale 20 vidhayakon main ek mantri bhi shaamil hai
 On the question of responsibility, Somnath Bharti goes on to say, "brother in this party, neither is getting gold by becoming a minister, nor is getting gold by becoming a parliamentary secretary and neither by getting an MLA
 aam aadmi party main ghis-ghiskar kaam karnaa hota he
 Nobody dreams of an MLA or MP in this party
 ye chakachaundh bijepi or congress main hoti he
 There is no glare in the Aam Aadmi Party
 "haalanki khud vakil hone ke naate aam aadmi party ke vidhayak somnath bharti ko bharosa he ki unhen court se raahat milegi
 Bharti says that for the sake of justice, the High Court will move to a double bench and then to the Supreme Court
 aam aadmi party ko vishwaas he ki chunaav ayog kii harakat ko supreme court yaa hycourt nazarandaaz nahin karegi
 For the last 3 years, we are hearing that the order of Delhi Government will not be valid until LG Saheb signs it
 sansadeey sachiv ke order par alji sahab ne sin nahin kiya tha
 "when asked the question of making laws after making appointments to Somnath Bharti, he sat claiming that 20 mlas were never appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries
 bharti ke mutabik aadhe adhure order par maamla banaakar 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar de diya gaya
 When asked questions on taking advantage of the post from Somnath Bharti, he said, "neither the car, nor the bungalow, nor the office, nor a pen have been taken, then how was the profit made?" vidhansabha ke andar spikar mahoday ne rakrakhaav par kharchaa kiya tha, jo unka haq he
 Officially the mlas did not get any office, but what is the harm if the table and chair is called as office, which is used to work for the public
 "aam aadmi party ke vidhayak somnath bharti kaa maananaa he ki hycourt ek sanvaidhanik sanstha he or is sanstha se nyaay milane kii ummid isliye he kyonki sansadeey sachiv kii niyukti par hycourt ne hi roak laga di thi

 Will India go on an independent path to meet its energy needs or will America go wherever it is? The Times of India is heading that Nikki Helle is speaking out in stern language that imports from Iran will have to be stopped
 nikki hele sanyukt raashtra main amareeki rajdoot hai or bharat kii yatra par hai
 America wants India to bring oil imports from Iran to zero
 obama ke kaarykaal main jab iran par pratibandh laga tha tab bharat chah maheene ke bheetar 20 pratishat aayaat kam kar rahaa tha magar ab trump chaahate hai ki ek hi baar main puraa band kar diya jaae
 The statement of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is printed in the Indian Express
 aap is bayaan par gaur kiijie jiskaa maine express se lekar anuwaad kiya he
 It seems that the oil minister is the foreign minister and he has given a sharp reply to Trump
 agar aisa he to pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantri ko aupchaarik rup de dena chahie taaki janata ko pataa chale ki iran pratibandh ko lekar bharat kii kya niti he
 "india's position has become so strong in the last two years that no oil producing country can ignore our needs and expectations
 mere liye meraa hit hi sarvopari he or main jahaan se chaahunga vahiin se bhu-raajnneetik sthiti or apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se kaccha tel khridoongaa
 We will buy crude oil from where we want
 " This statement is of Dharmendra Pradhan
 aapako hansi aani chahie
 If India has become stronger in two years, then why does India not say clearly
 jabaki isi express main isi bayaan ke bagal main ek kollam kii khabar lagi he ki tel rifineriyon ko kaha gaya he ki ve vikalp kii talash shuru kar den
 He was told this by the Oil Ministry, whose minister is Dharmendra Pradhan
 sutron ke hawaale se is khabar main likhaa he ki taiyaari shuru kar den kyonki ho saktaa he ki tel kaa aayaat bahut kam kiya jaae yaa phir ekadam band kar diya jaae
 See the statement of the minister against this
 saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki jo america kahegaa ham vahi karenge or ham vahi karte rahe hai
 There is no question of 56 inches in it
 aap rupee kii keemat par politics kar logon ko murkh bana sakate hai, bana liya or bana bhi lenge lekin uskaa girnaa thode na roak sakate hai
 In the same way, Trump cannot be denied directly
 zarur bharat ne america se aayaat kii ja rahi chizon par shulk badhaayaa he magar is suchi main wo motorcycle nahin he jis par aayaat shulk ghataane kii soochna khud pradhanmantri ne trump ko di thi
 Now you can understand politics, see propaganda? bijness standard ke pej chah par nidhi verma kii khabar chhapi he ki bharat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 You tell me, should there be such a big news on the inside page? It is written in this news that the oil ministry has asked the refineries to start alternative arrangements
 yah pehla sanket he ki bharat sarkaar america kii ghudki par harakat karne lagi he
 India has said that it does not recognize unilateral sanctions on behalf of any country
 vah sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 But when this is said, then why is this thing not being repeated when Nikki Haley comes to Delhi and is clearly saying that imports from Iran will have to be zeroed
 hindi akhabaaron main ye sab jaankaree nahin milegi
 i bring it to you with hard work so that you can understand the world by reading them
 zaruri nahin ki aap bhakt se no bhakt ban jaaen magar jaan kar bhakt bane rahanaa acha he, kam se kam afsos to nahin hoga ki dhokhaa kha gaye
 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him
 jab khud unki party mazaar mandir jane kii rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kar chuki he to itani jaldi to nahin janaa chahie tha
 When you went, you did not have to say the wrong thing
 magahar main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki "aisa kehete hai ki yaheen par sant kabir, guru nanak dev ji or guru gorakhnath ek saath baithkar aadhyatmik charchaa karte the" jabaki teenon alag-alag sadi main paidaa hue
 Similarly, in Karnataka, Bhagat Singh lied that no one went to meet him
 aap sochie, jab pradhanmantri itnaa kaam karte hai, to unke paas har duusare din bhaashan dene kaa vakt kahaan se aata he
 You track the wrong facts in their work, travels and speeches and speeches, you will be sad that the leader whom the public loves so much, why does that leader lie so much
 kya majaburi he, kya kaam vaaki kuch nahin hua he
 The comments aaj nahin, kal nahin, saath saal baad hi sahi, puuchhenge to sahi
 What is wrong about Kabir, Nanak and Gorakhnath? kya galat or jhooth bolne se hi janata bevakoof banati he? kya bharat ko vishwa guru banane kii baat karne vaale modi bharat ko bevakoof bananaa chaahate hai?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki yah kiskaa or kaisaa paisa he? kaala dhan nahin he to kya legal tareeke se bhi bhartiya amir apana paisa ab bhartiya bainkon main nahin rakh rahe hai? kya unka bharosa kamazor ho rahaa he? 2015 main sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ek sakht kanoon paas kiya tha jiske tahat bina jaankaree ke baahar paisa rakhana mushkil bataaya gaya tha
 There was a provision for imprisonment ranging from 6 months to 7 years along with fines
 vitt mantri ko report dena chahie ki is kanoon ke banane ke baad kya pragati hui yaa phir is kanoon ko kagaz par boj badhaane ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 Currently, there are two Finance Ministers
 donon main se kisi ko bhartiya rupee ke ludhakne par likhnaa chahie or bataanaa chahie ki 2013 main sansad main jo unhone bhaashan diya tha, vahi baat kar rahe hai yaa usase alag baat kar rahe hai or unka jawaab manmohan singh ke jawaab se kyon alag he
 The price of one dollar has crossed Rs 69 and it is being talked about going to Rs 71
 jabaki modi ke aane se 40 rupee tak le aane kaa khwaab dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 Keep an eye on the news about Iran's ban on Iran
 kya bharat apni urja zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye swatantra raah par chalegaa yaa america jidhar haankega udhar jayega? times of india kii heading he ki nikki hele sakht zabaan main bol rahi hai ki iran se aayaat band karnaa padegaa
 Nikki Helle is the US Ambassador to the United Nations and is visiting India
 america chahta he ki bharat iran se tel kaa aayaat shunya par laae
 When Iran was banned during Obama's tenure, India was reducing imports by 20 percent within six months, but now Trump wants to be completely stopped at one go
 indian express main tel mantri dharmendra pradhan kaa bayaan chapa he
 Consider this statement, which i have translated from Express
 aisa lagata he ki tel mantri hi videsh mantri hai or inhone trump ko do took jawaab de diya he
 If this is the case then the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister should be formalized so that the public knows what is India's policy regarding the Iran ban
 "pichley do saal main bharat kii sthiti itani majboot ho chuki he ki koi bhi tel utpaadak desh hamaari zaruuraton or ummiido ko nazarandaaz nahin kar saktaa he
 For me, my interest is paramount and from where i want, i will buy crude oil according to my geo-political situation and my needs
 ham jahaan se chahenge vahaan se kaccha tel khreedenge
 " ye bayaan he dharmendra pradhan kaa
 You should laugh agar do saal main bharat kii sthiti majboot ho gai he to bharat saaf-saaf kyon nahin kah detaa he
 Whereas in the same express, a column has been reported next to the same statement that oil refineries have been asked to start looking for alternatives
 unhen ye baat tel mantralay ne hi kahi he jiske mantri dharmendra pradhan hai
 In the news quoting the sources, it is written that they should start preparations because the import of oil may be greatly reduced or it should be stopped altogether
 iske barakes aap mantri kaa bayaan dekhie
 It should be clearly said that we will do what America says and we have been doing the same
 isamen 56 eench kii koi baat hi nahin he
 You can fool people by doing politics at the cost of rupees, they will be made and even made, but it can not stop its fall
 vaise hi trump ko sidhe-sidhe manaa nahin kar sakate
 Sure, India has increased the duty on things being imported from America, but this list does not have the motorcycle on which the Prime Minister himself had informed Trump about the reduction of import duty
 ab aap politics samaj paa rahe hai, propeganda dekh paa rahe hai? Nidhi Verma's news has appeared on page six of the Business Standard that India has agreed to zero oil imports from Iran
 aap hi bataaiye kya itani badi khabar bheetar ke pej par honi chahie thi? is khabar main likhaa he ki tel mantralay ne rifineriyon ko kaha he ki vaikalpik intazaam shuru kar den
 This is the first sign that the Government of India has begun to act on the whims of America
 bharat kah chukaa he ki vah kisi desh kii taraf se iktarafa pratibandh ko manyata nahin detaa he
 It follows the UN ban
 lekin jab yah kaha he to phir is baat ko tab kyon nahin doharaaya ja rahaa he jab nikki heli dilli aakar saaf saaf kah rahi hai ki iran se aayaat ko shunya karnaa padegaa

 Either of the two should write on the Indian rupee depreciation and state that the speech he gave in Parliament in 2013 is speaking or talking differently and why his answer is different from Manmohan Singh's answer

 Think, when the Prime Minister does so much work, where does he have the time to give a speech every other day
 aap unke kaam, yatraaon or bhaashan or bhaashanon main galat salat tathyon ko trek kiijie, aapako dukh hoga ki jis netaa ko janata itnaa pyaar karti he, wo netaa itnaa jhooth kyon bolta he
 What is helplessness, is nothing really done? tippaniyan Not today, not tomorrow, only after sixty years, if asked correctly
 kabir, nanak or gorakhnath ko lekar galat bolne kii kya zarurat he

 The statement of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan is printed in the Indian Express
 aap is bayaan par gaur kiijie jiskaa maine express se lekar anuwaad kiya he
 It seems that the oil minister is the foreign minister and he has given a sharp reply to Trump
 agar aisa he to pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantri ko aupchaarik rup de dena chahie taaki janata ko pataa chale ki iran pratibandh ko lekar bharat kii kya niti he
 "india's position has become so strong in the last two years that no oil producing country can ignore our needs and expectations
 mere liye meraa hit hi sarvopari he or main jahaan se chaahunga vahiin se bhu-raajnneetik sthiti or apni zaruuraton ke hisaab se kaccha tel khridoongaa
 We will buy crude oil from where we want
 " This statement is of Dharmendra Pradhan
 aapako hansi aani chahie
 If India has become stronger in two years, then why does India not say clearly
 jabaki isi express main isi bayaan ke bagal main ek kollam kii khabar lagi he ki tel rifineriyon ko kaha gaya he ki ve vikalp kii talash shuru kar den
 He was told this by the Oil Ministry, whose minister is Dharmendra Pradhan
 sutron ke hawaale se is khabar main likhaa he ki taiyaari shuru kar den kyonki ho saktaa he ki tel kaa aayaat bahut kam kiya jaae yaa phir ekadam band kar diya jaae
 See the statement of the minister against this
 saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki jo america kahegaa ham vahi karenge or ham vahi karte rahe hai
 There is no question of 56 inches in it
 aap rupee kii keemat par politics kar logon ko murkh bana sakate hai, bana liya or bana bhi lenge lekin uskaa girnaa thode na roak sakate hai
 In the same way, Trump cannot be denied directly
 zarur bharat ne america se aayaat kii ja rahi chizon par shulk badhaayaa he magar is suchi main wo motorcycle nahin he jis par aayaat shulk ghataane kii soochna khud pradhanmantri ne trump ko di thi
 Now you can understand politics, see propaganda? bijness standard ke pej chah par nidhi verma kii khabar chhapi he ki bharat iran se tel aayaat ko shunya karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he
 You tell me, should there be such a big news on the inside page? It is written in this news that the oil ministry has asked the refineries to start alternative arrangements
 yah pehla sanket he ki bharat sarkaar america kii ghudki par harakat karne lagi he
 India has said that it does not recognize unilateral sanctions on behalf of any country
 vah sanyukt raashtra ke pratibandh kaa hi anusaran karata he
 But when this is said, then why is this thing not being repeated when Nikki Haley comes to Delhi and is clearly saying that imports from Iran will have to be zeroed
 hindi akhabaaron main ye sab jaankaree nahin milegi
 i bring it to you with hard work so that you can understand the world by reading them
 zaruri nahin ki aap bhakt se no bhakt ban jaaen magar jaan kar bhakt bane rahanaa acha he, kam se kam afsos to nahin hoga ki dhokhaa kha gaye
 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him
 jab khud unki party mazaar mandir jane kii rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kar chuki he to itani jaldi to nahin janaa chahie tha
 When you went, you did not have to say the wrong thing
 magahar main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki "aisa kehete hai ki yaheen par sant kabir, guru nanak dev ji or guru gorakhnath ek saath baithkar aadhyatmik charchaa karte the" jabaki teenon alag-alag sadi main paidaa hue
 Similarly, in Karnataka, Bhagat Singh lied that no one went to meet him
 aap sochie, jab pradhanmantri itnaa kaam karte hai, to unke paas har duusare din bhaashan dene kaa vakt kahaan se aata he
 You track the wrong facts in their work, travels and speeches and speeches, you will be sad that the leader whom the public loves so much, why does that leader lie so much
 kya majaburi he, kya kaam vaaki kuch nahin hua he
 The comments aaj nahin, kal nahin, saath saal baad hi sahi, puuchhenge to sahi
 What is wrong about Kabir, Nanak and Gorakhnath? kya galat or jhooth bolne se hi janata bevakoof banati he? kya bharat ko vishwa guru banane kii baat karne vaale modi bharat ko bevakoof bananaa chaahate hai?disclemur (asveekaran) : is aalekh main vyakt kiye gaye vichaar lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 "pichley do saal main bharat kii sthiti itani majboot ho chuki he ki koi bhi tel utpaadak desh hamaari zaruuraton or ummiido ko nazarandaaz nahin kar saktaa he
 For me, my interest is paramount and from where i want, i will buy crude oil according to my geo-political situation and my needs
 ham jahaan se chahenge vahaan se kaccha tel khreedenge
 " ye bayaan he dharmendra pradhan kaa
 You should laugh agar do saal main bharat kii sthiti majboot ho gai he to bharat saaf-saaf kyon nahin kah detaa he
 Whereas in the same express, a column has been reported next to the same statement that oil refineries have been asked to start looking for alternatives
 unhen ye baat tel mantralay ne hi kahi he jiske mantri dharmendra pradhan hai
 In the news quoting the sources, it is written that they should start preparations because the import of oil may be greatly reduced or it should be stopped altogether
 iske barakes aap mantri kaa bayaan dekhie
 It should be clearly said that we will do what America says and we have been doing the same
 isamen 56 eench kii koi baat hi nahin he
 You can fool people by doing politics at the cost of rupees, they will be made and even made, but it can not stop its fall
 vaise hi trump ko sidhe-sidhe manaa nahin kar sakate
 Sure, India has increased the duty on things being imported from America, but this list does not have the motorcycle on which the Prime Minister himself had informed Trump about the reduction of import duty
 ab aap politics samaj paa rahe hai, propeganda dekh paa rahe hai? Nidhi Verma's news has appeared on page six of the Business Standard that India has agreed to zero oil imports from Iran
 aap hi bataaiye kya itani badi khabar bheetar ke pej par honi chahie thi? is khabar main likhaa he ki tel mantralay ne rifineriyon ko kaha he ki vaikalpik intazaam shuru kar den
 This is the first sign that the Government of India has begun to act on the whims of America
 bharat kah chukaa he ki vah kisi desh kii taraf se iktarafa pratibandh ko manyata nahin detaa he
 It follows the UN ban
 lekin jab yah kaha he to phir is baat ko tab kyon nahin doharaaya ja rahaa he jab nikki heli dilli aakar saaf saaf kah rahi hai ki iran se aayaat ko shunya karnaa padegaa
 All this information will not be found in Hindi newspapers
 mehnat se aap tak laata hum taaki aap inhen padhate hue desh duniya ko samaj saken
 It is not necessary that you become a devotee from a devotee, but knowing that it is good to remain a devotee, at least you will not regret having been cheated
 ab dekhie, mul sawaalon par charchaa na ho isliye sarkaar yaa bhaajapa kaa koi na koi netaa itihaas ke gade murde ukhaad laata he
 That too wrong salat
 tu tu main main kii politics chalaane ke liye
 Every day you open the channel and see for yourself, you will know where the country is going
 jin netaaon ke paas janata kii samasya padhane or niraakaran kaa vakt nahin he, wo achaanak aise bayaan de rahe hai jaise subah subah uthte hi itihaas kii ek kitaab khatm kar lete hai
 They also speak wrong in that
 ab dekhie pradhanmantri magahar gaye kabir kii jayanti manaane
 What did he deliver there
 kitna kabir par diya or kitna mayawati akhilesh par diya, isse aapako pataa chalegaa ki unke liye kabir kaa kya matlab he
 When his own party has criticized Rahul Gandhi's politics of going to Mazar temple, it should not have gone so soon
 jab gaye to galat salat to nahin bolnaa tha
 In Maghar, the Prime Minister said that "it is here that Saint Kabir, Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Gorakhnath used to sit together and have spiritual discussions" while the three were born in different centuries
 karnataka main isi tarah bhagat singh ko lekar jhooth bol aae ki koi unase milane nahin gaya

 hindi akhabaaron main ye sab jaankaree nahin milegi
 i bring it to you with hard work so that you can understand the world by reading them
 zaruri nahin ki aap bhakt se no bhakt ban jaaen magar jaan kar bhakt bane rahanaa acha he, kam se kam afsos to nahin hoga ki dhokhaa kha gaye
 Now see, the original questions are not discussed, so some leader of the government or the BJP, uproots the issues of history
 wo bhi galat salat
 To run the politics of tu tu main main
 har din aap channel khol kar khud se dekh len, pataa chalegaa ki desh kahaan ja rahaa he
 Leaders who do not have time to read and solve the problems of the public, are suddenly making such statements as soon as they wake up in the morning, they finish a book of history
 usamen bhi galat bol dete hai
 Now see Prime Minister Maghar to celebrate the birth anniversary of Kabir
 vahaan bhaashan kya diya
 How much Kabir gave and how much Mayawati gave to Akhilesh, you will know what Kabir means for him
 jab khud unki party mazaar mandir jane kii rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kar chuki he to itani jaldi to nahin janaa chahie tha
 When you went, you did not have to say the wrong thing

 ab dekhie, mul sawaalon par charchaa na ho isliye sarkaar yaa bhaajapa kaa koi na koi netaa itihaas ke gade murde ukhaad laata he
 That too wrong salat
 tu tu main main kii politics chalaane ke liye
 Every day you open the channel and see for yourself, you will know where the country is going
 jin netaaon ke paas janata kii samasya padhane or niraakaran kaa vakt nahin he, wo achaanak aise bayaan de rahe hai jaise subah subah uthte hi itihaas kii ek kitaab khatm kar lete hai
 They also speak wrong in that
 ab dekhie pradhanmantri magahar gaye kabir kii jayanti manaane
 What did he deliver there
 kitna kabir par diya or kitna mayawati akhilesh par diya, isse aapako pataa chalegaa ki unke liye kabir kaa kya matlab he
 When his own party has criticized Rahul Gandhi's politics of going to Mazar temple, it should not have gone so soon
 jab gaye to galat salat to nahin bolnaa tha
 In Maghar, the Prime Minister said that "it is here that Saint Kabir, Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Gorakhnath used to sit together and have spiritual discussions" while the three were born in different centuries
 karnataka main isi tarah bhagat singh ko lekar jhooth bol aae ki koi unase milane nahin gaya
 Think, when the Prime Minister does so much work, where does he have the time to give a speech every other day
 aap unke kaam, yatraaon or bhaashan or bhaashanon main galat salat tathyon ko trek kiijie, aapako dukh hoga ki jis netaa ko janata itnaa pyaar karti he, wo netaa itnaa jhooth kyon bolta he
 What is helplessness, is nothing really done? tippaniyan Not today, not tomorrow, only after sixty years, if asked correctly
 kabir, nanak or gorakhnath ko lekar galat bolne kii kya zarurat he
 Does the public become stupid by lying and lying? Does Modi, who talks of making India a world guru, want to fool India? Disclaimer (disclaimer): The views expressed in this article are the personal views of the author

 According to research, one in every 20 mobile phone users cleans their phone screen once every six months
 is shodh ke dauraan shodhakartaaon ne yphone, samsung or google ke phone ke screen kii jaanch kii
 During this time, it was found that the consumer using the phone is not very aware of his phone
 yahi vajah he ki bazaar main phone kii screen saaf karne ke liye tamaam utpaada uplabdh hone ke baad bhi vah unka istemaal nahin karte hai
 Research has been told that if the phone users do not change their habits in time, then they may have to bear the brunt of it further

 During this research, the researchers examined the screen of the phone of iphone, Samsung and Google
 is dauraan pataa chalaa ki phone kaa istemaal karne vaale upabhokta apane phone ke prati zyada jaagruk nahin he
 This is the reason why they do not use them even after all the products are available to clear the phone screen in the market
 shodh main bataaya gaya ki agar samay rahete phone upabhokta apni in aadaton ko nahin badalte hai to unhen aage iskaa bada khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he

 The Government of India had cut the salary of ISRO scientists just before the launch of Chandrayaan-2
 centre sarkaar ne 12 june 2019 ko jari ek aadesh main kaha he ki isro vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ko saal 1996 se do atirikt vetan vruddhi ke rup main mil rahi, protsaahan anudaan raashi ko band kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the situation when the whole country is proud of the achievements of ISRO scientists
 ab isro ke vaigyanikon ke sanghathan spes ejiniers association (SEA) ne isro ke chairman dow
 K
 sivan ko patr likhakar maang kii he ki ve isro vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah main katautee karne vaale centre sarkaar ke aadesh ko radd karne main madad karen
 Because scientists have no other means of earning other than salary
 SEA ke adhyaksh e
 Maniraman has written in a letter to the ISRO chief that any deduction in the salary of a government employee cannot be done until a very serious situation arises
 tankhwaah main katautee hone se vaigyanikon ke utsaah main kami aegi
 We are extremely shocked and saddened by the decision of the Scientific Central Government
 padhe, ajtak ne sabase pehle bataaya tha ki chandrayan-2 se pehle kaati gai ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahaishaia ne isro chif ko likhe patr main binduvaar ye maange rakhi hai
 
 
 Two additional increments for ISRO scientists were given by the President
 taaki desh main maujuud behtareen talents ko isro vaigyanik banane kaa protsaahan mili
 Also, ISRO scientists could also be inspired
 ye atirikt vetan vruddhi supreme court ke aadesh ke baad 1996 main antariksh vibhaag ne lagu kiya tha
 The Supreme Court order said that this increment should be clearly considered as 'salary'
 chathe vetan ayog main bhi is vetan vruddhi ko jari rakhane kii sifarish kii gai thi
 It was also said that ISRO scientists should continue to get its benefits
 do atirikt vetan vruddhi isliye lagu kiya gaya tha ki isro main aane vaale yuva vaigyanikon ko niyukti ke samay hi prerana mil sake or ve isro main lambey samay tak kaam kar saken
 The Central Government order mentions the Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS)
 ham yah bataanaa chaahate hai ki atirikt vetan vruddhi or PRIS donon hi puri tarah se alag-alag hai
 One is incentive, while the other is salary
 donon ekadusre kii purti kisi bhi tarah se nahin karte
 No deduction in the salary of a government employee can be made until a very serious situation arises
 isro vaigyanikon ke sanghathan dwaara isro chif ko likhi gai chitthee
 Letter written by ISRO Scientists Organization to ISRO Chief
 ye tha centre sarkaar katankhwaah kaatane valaadeshis aadesh main kaha gaya he ki 1 july 2019 se yah protsaahan raashi band ho jaaegi
 After this order, scientists of the D, E, f and g category will no longer get this incentive
 isro main kareeb 16 hajaar vaigyanik or ejeeniyar hai
 But by this government order, about 85 to 90 percent of isro's scientists and engineers will lose 8 to 10 thousand rupees
 kyonki zyaadaatar vaigyanik inhen shreniyon main aate hai
 ISRO scientists are angry about this
 bataa den ki vaigyanikon ko protsaahit karne, isro kii ore unka jhukaav badhaane or santhaan chhodkar nahin jane ke liye varsh 1996 main yah protsaahan raashi shuru kii gai thi
 The order issued by the central government said that on the basis of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, the Finance Ministry and the Department of Expenditure have advised the Department of Space to discontinue this incentive
 isaki jagah ab sirf parformens related incentive skim (PRIS) lagu kii gai he
 Till now ISRO was providing both incentive and PRIS scheme facilities to its scientists
 lekin ab centre sarkaar ne nirnay kiya he ki atirikt vetan ke taur par di jane vaali yah protsaahan raashi 1 july se milani band ho jaaegi
 Recruitment of ISRO scientists is in c category, the incentive amount used to be given on promotion
 Recruitment of any scientist in ISRO starts from c category
 iske baad unka pramotion D, E, F, g or aage kii shreniyon main hota he
 Each category has a test before promotion, the one who passes it gets this incentive grant money
 lekin ab jab july kii tankhwaah agast main aegi, tab vaigyanikon ko usamen katautee dikhegi

 Any special occasion in our country is not considered complete without creating henna
 par menhadi tabhi khubasurat lagati he, jab uskaa rang gaharaa ho or yah sahi se rache
 Mehndi has a special dark red color that looks very beautiful on the hands
 kai baar aisa hota he ki menhadi lagi to bahut acchhee hoti he lekin sahi se na rachane ke kaaran khubasurat dizin bhi khilakar nahin aa paata
 In such a situation, you can make deep and beautiful henna by adopting these measures
 haalanki pehle yah sunishchit kar len ki aapaki menhadi kaa ghol achche se taiyaar kiya gaya ho
 By adopting these remedies, henna will get deeper: 1
 menhadi lagane ke baad dhairya rakhana bahut jaruri he
 Allow the henna to remain on the hands for at least five to six hours
 isse menhadi kaa rang gaharaa chadhataa he
 2
 neembu or chini ke ghol ke istemaal se bhi menhadi kaa rang gaharaa chadhataa he
 Actually, by applying this solution, henna sticks in the hands for a long time and this makes its color darker
 3
 Putting a few cloves buds in a frying pan and taking their smoke on hand is also an effective solution
 aisa karne se menhadi kaarang gaharaa ho jaataa he
 4
 menhadi chhudaane ke liye pani kaa istemaal na karen
 If possible, avoid using water on hands for 10 to 12 hours
 sabun ke istemaal se dur hi rahen to behatar hoga
 After weaning the henna, rub mustard oil on your hands
 in upayon ko apnaane se menhadi kaa rang gaharaa chadhataa he

 Narendra Modi, who brought the BJP to power for the third time in a row on his own in the Gujarat assembly elections, is being considered as the party's strongest contender for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Modi has proved that you like him or Disappointed, cannot ignore them
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke prachaarak ke taur par kaam karne ke baad raajnneeti main aae 62-varshiya modi ne gujarat main vikaas ke naam par alag chhavi banaai he
 However, he also has a deep connection with controversies
 2002 main godhracand ke baad bhadke gujarat dangon kaa daag un par aaj bhi kaayam he, jisamen muslim samudaay ke 1,000 se adhik log maare gaye the
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat, who has been called the 'laboratory of Hindutva' of the Sangh Parivar, has also been accused of polarizing the communal grounds in the state
 modi ke virdohi bhi un par jamkar nishaanaa sadhate hai
 However, the number of fans and supporters outside the party and beyond is also not small
 modi ne pradesh main muslimon ko lubhaane ke kai prayaas kiye, lekin unke virdohi hameshaa unki chhavi is samudaay kaa dhyaan nahin rakhane vaale netaa ke taur par pesh karte rahe hai
 His critics say that he will always be stained by the Gujarat riots
 modi ne haal hi main ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki agar unhen doshi paaya gaya, to vah faansee par latakane ke liye taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, Modi's supporters also acclaim him as 'hindu Hriday Samrat'
 gujarat main halaat is kadar badalte hai ki 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main modi ko 'maut kaa saudagar' kehane sambandhi congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bayaan se bakheda khadaa ho gaya tha
 Modi, who has 11 years of experience as the Chief Minister of Gujarat and third successive success on his own, can present himself as a strong contender for the party's post of Prime Minister in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 modi ne aise samay main lagaataar teesri baar chunaav jitkar itihaas banaaya he, jab party ko centre kii satta main lautne ke liye majboot netritv kii jarurat he
 In 2001, Modi became the Chief Minister in place of Keshubhai
 keshubhai ne is saal bijepi se alag hokar apni nai party 'gujarat parivartan party' bana lee
 The comments mukhyamantri modi ne muslim samudaay ko lubhaane ke anek prayaas kiye, lekin is chunaav main ek bhi muslim ummidavaar ko tikat nahin diya
 In the 150th birth anniversary year of his idol Swami Vivekananda, he took out a journey in Gujarat and made direct contact with the public
 2002 ke dangon ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne modi ko apana 'raaj dharm' nibhaane kii naseehat di thi, lekin laalkrishna adwani or divangat pramod mahajan ne modi ko mukhyamantri ke pad par bane rahane main madad kii

 62-year-old Modi, who came into politics after working as a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has created a different image in the name of development in Gujarat
 haalanki vivaadon se bhi unka gaharaa rishta rahaa he
 The Gujarat riots that raged after the Godhraq in 2002 still haunt them, in which more than 1,000 people of the Muslim community were killed
 jab-tab sangh parivaar ke 'hindutv kii prayogshaala' kahe jane vaale gujarat ke mukhyamantri par rajya main sampradayik aadhaar par dhuvrikaran ke bhi aarope lagate rahe hai
 Modi's opponents also target him fiercely
 haalanki party or uske baahar unke prashansakon or samarthakon kii sankhya bhi kam nahin he
 Modi made several attempts to woo Muslims in the state, but his opponents have always portrayed him as a leader who does not care about the community
 unke aalochak kehete hai ki un par hameshaa gujarat dangon kaa dhabba laga rahegaa
 Modi recently said in an interview that if he is found guilty, he is ready to be hanged
 duusari taraf modi ke samarthak unhen 'hindu hriday samraat' kahkar bhi vaahvahee karte hai
 The situation in Gujarat changes so much that Congress President Sonia Gandhi's statement that Modi was called a 'merchant of death' in the 2007 assembly elections was upset
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par 11 saal ke anubhav or apane dam par lagaataar teesri safalataa hasil karne vaale modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main khud ko party ke pradhanmantri pad ke majboot daavedaar ke taur par pesh kar sakate hai
 Modi has made history by winning elections for the third consecutive time at a time when the party needs strong leadership to return to power at the Center

 Keshubhai split from BJP this year to form his new party 'gujarat Parivartan Party'

 After the 2002 riots, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had asked Modi to follow his 'raj Dharma', but LK Advani and the late Pramod Mahajan helped Modi to continue as the Chief Minister
 uske baad modi ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha

 Why would Taliban be happy with 'mother of All Bombs'? The target of US attack in Nangarhar on Thursday was the Khorasan module of ISIS
 ye modul pichley kareeb 2 saal se afghanistan ke purvi hisson me afgani taliban ko chunauti de rahaa tha
 After the revelations of Mullah Omar's death in 2015, Mulla Akhtar Mansoor was elected the leader of the Taliban
 lekin sanghathan kaa ek hissaa is faisle se khush nahin tha or taliban se tuutakar IS ke saath jud gaya tha
 Many Pakistani Taliban terrorists also joined this module after the action of the Pakistani Army
 lihaaja is karrwai ne afgani taliban ke dushmano ko hi khatm karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Why does the ISI need to be scared? But even then the ISI has very few reasons to be happy
 ISIS ke khurasaan modul ko pakistan ke kai aise sunni charampanthi sanghathanon kaa bhi sidhaa samarthan hasil he jo ISI kii upaj hai
 American action has taken place just 60 kilometers from the Pakistani border
 ye ilaaka ISI kii aatanki gatividhiyon se hameshaa sargarm rahata he
 With this attack, President Trump has shown that he will not miss out on attacking terrorists when needed
 ye jagajaahir he ki afgani taliban ke sabhi sargana or unke parivaar pakistan ke queta main rahete hai
 Therefore, the ISI will surely have to worry about whether Quetta will also be a target for Trump

 There is talk of action against those involved in Gokshi, but action against those involved in the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh is not there in this release
 yah bhi tathy he ki police subodh kumaar singh kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye esaiti bana chuki he or mukhyamantri ne unke parivaar ko 50 lakh muawza or ek sadsy ko naukari kii baat kahi he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla is continuously reporting this incident
 unhone un saat logon kaa pataa kiya jinke naam gokshi vaali exiaar main hai
 Saurav Shukla says that the complainant in Gaukashi's case is Yogesh Raj
 jabaki khet rajkumaar pradhan kaa tha

 It is not right to take the name of the organization, it is written in which police manual of the world

 Subodh Raj is absconding

 That's quite right video main nahaaya dhoyaa lagata he

 Even the lawsuits that may affect the future of these youth

 The big leader has done his job by giving them the pill of ideology
 kisi ko isaki chintaa nahin he ki kathith rup se gokshi ke maamle main koun shaamil he, bas jo bhi saamne he vahi aaropee he
 Today many of these young men must have run for the murder charges
 jinaki bandook se goli chali or subodh kumaar singh kii maut hui, wo zindagi bhar apane gunaah se bhaagta rahegaa
 After becoming assassins, big leaders will also make a distance

 In a video, a voice is heard about where the meat allegedly came from, who brought it, who cut it
 police jaanch kar rahi he
 Those who had come to know of meat in their fields did not want to quarrel, but people from other villages came to quarrel

 Tractors, carts, weapons, stones, poles were all brought

 The sound of the bullet comes but when the camera reaches this officer, the man withdraws from the frame
 peeche chalaa jaataa he
 The voice comes, oh yes! iske baad sab bhaagane lagate hai

 The letter is named after bjp's block chief Prabhendra Yadav, BJP assembly convenor, Vijay Kumar Lodhi, Mandal president Mukesh Bhardwaj, BJP city general secretary Sanjay Srotiya
 dastakhat bhi hai
 Manoj Tyagi is the name of former MP
 saansad ne patr milane kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he magar kya kuch karrwai bhi kii gai thi, is bare main nahin bataaya
 Many types of videos have been found
 ek video main awaz sunai de rahi he ki kathith rup se maance kahaan se aayaa, koun laayaa, kisne kaata
 The Police is investigating
 jinke khet main maance milane kii khabar ai thi wo jhagada nahin chaahate the, lekin duusare gaanv se log jhagade ke liye aa gaye
 His complete preparation is seen before arrival
 tractor, katte, hathiyaar, pathar, danda sab lekar aae the
 Watching a video of it is like placing a stone on the heart
 khet main jeep khadi he
 Watching the video, it seems that someone takes close to Subodh Kumar Singh with a pistol
 goli kii awaz aati he magar camera jab is adhikari ke paas pahunchataa he to vah aadmi frem se hat jaataa he
 Goes back
 awaz aati he are ye to esao
 After this, everyone starts running
 mangalvaar kii raat main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne bulandshahr kii ghatana ko lekar vishesh baithak bulaai
 Subodh Singh is not even mentioned in the press release issued after this incident
 press release main likhaa he- upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne aaj yahaan apane sarkari awaas par bulandshahr kii ghatana ke sambandh main mukhya sachiv, police mahanideshak, pramukh sachiv, grih, apper police mahanideshak ke saath baithak kii
 After reviewing this incident, the Chief Minister has instructed that strict investigation should be taken against all the persons involved in cow slaughter
 unhone kaha ki ghatana ek bade shadyatr kaa hissaa he
 All direct and indirect elements related to cow slaughter should be arrested in a timely manner
 unhone yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki abhiyaan chalaakar maahaul kharaab karne vaale tatwon ko benakaab kar is prakaar saazish rachane waalon ke viruddh prabhavi karrwai kii jaae
 It is not clear who are the elements who spoil the atmosphere by campaigning? Is the Chief Minister talking about action against the mob, then why is Subodh Kumar Singh not named in this press release
 gokshi main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat he, magar subodh kumaar singh kii hatya main shaamil logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat is relies main nahin he
 There is also the fact that the police has formed an SIT to investigate the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh and the Chief Minister has called for 50 lakh compensation to his family and a job to a member
 hamaare sahyogi saurabh shukla is ghatana kii lagaataar reporting kar rahe hai
 He found out seven people whose names are in the Gokshi FIR
 saurav shukla kaa kahana he ki gaukashi ke maamle main shikayatakarta yogesh raaj he
 While the farm belonged to Prince Pradhan
 ho saktaa he ki maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue subodh kumaar singh ne un naamon ko darj kar liya jinke sahi hone par vivaad ho rahaa he
 Not only this, the names of two children of Nayabas village have also been put in the FIR
 ek 11 saal kaa he or doosraa 12 saal kaa he
 His father told Saurabh that such young children cannot do this work and they had gone to Bulandshahr at that time
 hamaare sahyogi saurabh shukla ne rajkumaar pradhan kii patni se baat kii thi, jinke kheton main maance phenkaa gaya tha
 He told Saurav that we did not want to pursue the matter
 lekin bheed aa gai or jabardastee trali main daalkar aage le gai
 Needless to say what motive this mob had come
 rajkumaar pradhan ke khet ke bagal main premjit kaa bhi khet he
 Pieces of meat were lying there too
 prem jeet singh ne hi saurabh se baat karte hue bajrang dal kaa naam liya
 There is a lot of detail in the media about Yogesh Raj, one of the names in the FIR
 print, vir, scrol kii site par yogesh kii tasviren or twit hai
 When he is seen participating in the program of the Sangh, he is taking a picture with a stick on the jeep
 bajrang dal kaa zila sanyojak he
 But the police is not naming any organization on its behalf
 kya police ko un sanghathanon kaa naam lene main dar lag rahaa he
 In the press conference on Tuesday, ADG LA & Order Anand Kumar said why the organization is not important
 sanghathan kaa naam lenaa kadaapi uchit nahin he, yah baat duniya ke kis police manual main likhi he
 When was this Qaeda formed? subodh raaj faraar he
 But his statement is going on whatsapp
 wo kaaphi thik he
 The video appears bathed
 gulabi kurte main dikh rahaa he
 Still looking relaxed isliye yogesh kii chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 The FIR has 26 names besides Yogesh Raj
 exiaar ke ek hissaa main likhaa he- bheed ke namit uparokt vyakti hinsa ke liye bhadakaate rahe, jisamen is bheed ke samooh main sammilit sabhi logon dwaara uparokt vyaktiyon ke netritv main ek raay hokar avaidh asalhon, dhardaar hathiyaaron, lathi dandon se jaan se maarane kii niyat se ham police waalon par hamalaa kar diya jisamen prabharee nireekshak subodh kumaar singh ko goli markar va gambheer chot pahunchaai tathaa prabharee nireekshak syana ko ghekar unki nijee licency pistal va teen mobile phone ek main sarkari siusi sim tha, ko bhi chhinakar le gaye tathaa lagaataar firing karte rahe
 Broke government wireless sets and set fire to government and private property of the outpost
 kshetradhikari syana apni jaan bachaane ke liye jab chaowkee ke kamare main ghuse to bheed or ugr ho gai or maaro maaro kaa shor karte hue chaowkee main aag laga di
 The police were constantly retreating for self-defense, and the said mob of chaotic elements was constantly growing angry and attacking, making the noise of the beatings
 tippaniyan Where did the crowd, stones, bullets, weapons come from? Is all of this suddenly gathered by chance or is it part of some preparation
 kya subodh kumaar singh kii chhavi khaas tareeke se gadhi gai thi jiske chalate unhen nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 a letter from BJP leaders from across the district has been received which he wrote to his brother-in-law Bhola Singh on this one September
 patr ke ek hisse main likhaa he- aapako avgat karana chaahate hai ki prabharee nireekshak syana subodh kumaar singh kaa vyavhaar aam janata ke prati abhadra he
 In the area, theft, animal husbandry, illegal vehicles are increasing, in the name of vehicle checking in the area, residents are being unnecessarily harassed and illegal recovery is being done
 hinduon ke dharmik kaaryon ke aayojan main aadchan paidaa kar hindu samaaj main aakrosh punap rahaa he
 Please take departmental action against such police officers immediately by transferring them

 There are also signatures
 manoj tyaagi purv saansad kaa naam he
 The MP has accepted the receipt of the letter but did not say whether some action was also taken
 iskaa video dekhnaa kaleje par pathar rakhane jaisaa he
 Jeep is standing in the field
 video dekhne se lagata he koi pistal lekar subodh kumaar singh ke kareeb jaataa he
 The sound of the bullet comes but when the camera reaches this officer, the man withdraws from the frame

 In Bihar's Samastipur, the mob once again lynched the accused of mobile theft
 logon ne choron ko zanjeer se baandhakar ghanton pitayee kii
 Actually, 4 thieves who caught stealing mobiles at the railway station were caught red handed
 iske baadabheed ne kanoon haath main lete huecharon ko peet-petakar adhamra kar diya
 The police remained mute spectators during this time
 supreme court ne dahej virdohi kanoon ke durupyog par chintaa jaahir kii he
 The court said that the misuse of the anti-dowry law by 'disgruntled' wives against their husbands and other in-laws is a matter of concern
 iske saath hi court ne nai vyavastha di he ki police maamle main aaropee ko apane aap giraftaar nahin kar sakati he
 The reason for such a step in the case will be given which will be judicially reviewed
 supreme court ne kaha ki pehle giraftaar or phir baaki kaarywahi karne kaa ravaiya 'nindaneey' he jis par ankush lagaana chahie
 The court directed all state governments to ensure that the police do not resort to arrests for the offenses punishable with imprisonment up to seven years, including the dowry torture case
 jaj chandramauli kumaar prasad kii adhyakshata vaali khandpeeth ne kaha, 'ham sabhi rajya sarkaron ko nirdesh dete hai ki vah apane police adhikariyon ko hidaayat de ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 498-k ke tahat maamla darj hone par vah apane man se giraftaar nahin kare
 First satisfy yourself about the requirement of arrest under the criteria provided in Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure
 'kavach kii bajaay hathiyaar kii tarah istemalcort ne kaha ki police adhikari ko giraftaar karne kii jarurat ke bare main magistrate ke saamne kaaran or saamagree pesh kerani hogi
 The judge said, "section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code was included with the intention of curbing the problem of harassing the woman by her husband and her relatives
" dhara 498-k ko sangyeya or gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh hone ke kaaran praavdhaanon main ise sandigdh sthaan praapt he, jise asantusht patniyaan kavach kii bajaay hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karti hai
 'the arrest is hindered in the independence case, the judges said,' The easiest way to harass is to arrest the husband and his relatives under this provision
 anek maamalon main pati ke ashakt dada-daadi, videsh main dashakon se rahane vaali unki bahanon ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya
 The arrest disrupts and humiliates the person's freedom and stains them forever
 koi bhi giraftaar sirf isliye nahin kii jaani chahie ki aparaadh gaiyr jamaanti or sangyeya he
 The judges said, "the right to arrest is one thing and justifying its use is another
" giraftaar karne ke adhikaar ke saath hi police adhikari aisa karne ko kaarnon ke saath nyyochit tehraane yogya hona chahie
 No immediate arrest should be made on the basis of a person being accused of committing a crime
 doordarshee or budhimaan police adhikari ke liye uchit hoga ki aaropon kii sachai kii thodi bahut jaanch ke baad uchit tareeke se santusht huye bagaiyr koi giraftaar nahin kii jaae
 Referring to the crime figures, the court said that in 1977, under the Section 498-A, 197762 persons were arrested for the offense and under this provision, about one fourth of the persons arrested were women like husbands' mother and sister who were arrested
 Taken in the trap
 court ne kaha ki bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat hue aparaadhon main kul giraftaar vyaktiyon kaa yah chah fisadi he
 4 of the total offenses committed under various sections of the Penal Code
 5 fisadi he, jo chori or chot pahunchane jaise aparaadhon se itar kisi anya aparaadh se adhik he
 In such cases the rate of filing of chargesheet 93
 6 fisadi tak he, jabaki sajaa dilwane kii dar sirf 15 fisadi he
 Five members of the same family, including two women, were killed by some unidentified men with sharp weapons in Jammu Colony here
 police ne bataaya ki shanivaar subah dhardaar hathiyaaron se satpal (40), unki patni vinaa rani (45), betaa mukesh (25), bahu suman (23), ke alaava ek or bete rinku (22) kii hatya kar di gayi
 Satpal's brother informed the police about the incident
 police ne bataaya ki veena rani kaa shav bhandar ghar main paaya gaya jabaki parivaar ke anya sadasyon kaa shav ghar ke ek kamare se mila
 Satpal ran a marriage bureau
 unhone bataaya ki farkapur police stesan main is hatya ke silsile main ek maamla darj kiya gaya he or maamle kii chaanbin kii ja rahi he
