 The Supreme Court will hear on 30 July the petitions challenging the practice of circumcision of minor girls prevalent in the mostly settled Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community in Gujarat and Maharashtra
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha dharm ke naam par koi kisi mahila yaa ladki ke yon ang kaise chhu saktaa he
 Cutting of sexual organs is against the dignity and respect of women

 The central government supports the ban
 centre sarkaar ne ye bhi kaha ki iske liye dand vidhaan main saat saal tak kaid kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan bhi he

 According to the petition, this tradition of circumcising girls is neither valid in human form nor in the light of law
 kyonki ye samvidhan main samanta kii guarantee dene vaale anuchhedon main 14 or 21 kaa saream ulanghan he
 Therefore, the practice of circumcising girls under the guise of religion has been requested to declare it a non-bailable and cognizable offense
 yachika main kaha gaya ki ye to amanviya or asamvedansheel he
 So until the government enacts more stringent laws on this, the court should issue a guide line
 is parasarkaar ne courtko bataaya ki kanoon to pehle se hi he
 But the provisions contained in it can be seen again
 taaki maujuuda daur ke mutabik use samasamyik or upyogi banaaya ja sake

 When children lie they repeat the same thing over and over again

 Before the assembly elections due next year, all those old diseases have emerged inside the BJP which has been in exile of power for 14 years in UP, due to which it became the third party in the state
 gujarey 1 april ko lakhanu ke city maantesri skool parisar main chunavi varsh main upi bijepi kii pehali kaarysmiti kii baithak ho rahi thi
 There it was understood that all is not normal in the party
 isaki baangi tab dikhi, jab lakhanu ke saansad or kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh baithak main dikhaai nahin die
 While on the same day, he reached Lucknow on his three-day tour
 sawaal yah uthta he ki jab kaarysmiti kii pichhali sabhi baithkon main sthaneey saansadon ne bad-chadhakar hissaa liya tha to phir lakhanu ke saansad ne duuri kyon banaae rakhi? agar rajnath singh kisi duusare kaarykram main vyast the to unki uplabdhta ke hisaab se kaarysmiti kii baithak kyon nahin tay hui, jabaki ve agle din lakhanu main hi the?kaarykram sthal ke sabhaagaar main bhi bade netaaon ke saath rajnath kaa chitra na hona spasht kar rahaa tha ki samuhikta kii baat karne vaali party philhal apni niti se bhatak chuki he
 The matter did not end here
 kaarykram vaale din, raat main pradesh bijepi pravaktaa aai
 P
 singh ne fasebuk par 'bada hua to kya hua jaise ped khajur
 By writing a couplet of Kabir, attacked the Rajnath Singh in a gesture like 'do not shade the pantheon'; india today se unhone kaha ki pradesh kaarysmiti kii baithak main rajnath ke na aane se ve vyathit hai
 However, state president Laxmikant Bajpai shows the photo of Rajnath appearing on the last page of his presidential address book in the working committee, saying, "it is wrong to say that Rajnath Singh was ignored in the meeting
" vyastata ke kaaran ve nahin aa sake the
 "party leaders give lakhs cleanly, this whole episode has given rise to the camp of leaders in UP BJP
" party ke is chirparichit rog kaa hi nateeja he ki chaar maheene se party upi main nae pradesh adhyaksh kaa chunaav nahin kar pai he
 That is why the outline of any strong movement against the SP government could not be prepared even in the meeting
 loksabhaa chunaavon main bhagava dal se maat khain pramukh vipakshi partiyaan apane ummidavaar ghoshit kar vidhansabha chunaav ke maidan main taal thokkar khadi ho gai hai, jabaki duniya kii sabase badi party hone kaa daawa karne vaali party ko pradesh adhyaksh kaa chayan karne main paseene chhot rahe hai
 After the Lok Sabha elections, the election of the state president has become a sore throat for the BJP, which claims to have more than one crore members in UP
 varisht netaaon ke antarvirodhon main jakadi party abhi tak koi aisa cheharaa nahin khoj pai he, jo sarvamaanya ho
 This is the reason that during the last six months, the BJP has not been able to organize a single big protest against the anti-people policies of the ruling SP government
 vastav main bijepi netritv ke saamne sabase badi chunauti pradesh se us chehre kaa chayan karnaa he, jo upi bijepi prabharee om maathur, rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or grih mantri rajnath singh kaa bharosemand ho
 The name of Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha is currently at the forefront of these three criteria
 1 april ko hui bijepi pradesh kaarysmiti kii baithak ke dauraan kaarykram sthal par lagi hording main jis pramukhataa se manoj sinha ke chitra lage the, usase to yahi sanket mila ki kaaryakarta or netaa bijepi netritv kii manshaa soongh chuke hai
 Many leaders who have been involved in the race for the post of UP BJP President, are now trying to fit the equation to be part of the national president Amit Shah's team
 baat keval pradesh netritv ke chayan tak hi simit nahin he
 Out of a total of 90 districts and metros, the party has been able to deploy new presidents only in 58, while the deadline for it has expired in January itself
 gajiabad, saharanpur, varanasi, agra, kanpur jaise mahatvapurn jilon main lambit pade sanghathanaatmak chunaavon ne kaaryakartaaon main hataasha bhar di he
 Disputes among the big leaders in the mahalup BJP fueled by controversies came to light when on March 12, UP in-charge Om Mathur was holding a meeting of all state and regional officials
 lakhanu sthit pradesh karyaalay main sabhi netaa baithak main maujuud the, jabaki pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpeyi apane kaksh main baithe kaamkaaj nibata rahe the
 Later, when the meeting was issued by the party, the name of the state president was missing
 bajpeyi baithak main na jane kii vajah bataate hai, ''mujhe sanghathan mantri sunil bansal ne baithak kii koi jaankaree nahin di thi
 The factionalism between the state president and the organization minister has encouraged factionalism in the BJP since last year
 upi ke kai jile aise hai, jahaan bade netaaon ke aapasi vivaad se party ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 These controversies surfaced during the MLC election last month
 agra main emelsi pratyaashee tii
 P
 singh ne brajakshetra adhyaksh purushottam khandelwal ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he to meerut main bhi emelsi chunaav ko lekar kshetreey mahaamantri jayakaran gupta duusare netaaon ke nishane par hai
 Due to this factionalism, BJP could not win even one, which fielded 21 candidates in UP
 bijepi bhale hi aglaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne laayak taiyaari na kar pai ho, lekin bade netaaon ke mukhyamantri pad par daavedaari jataane se kai jagah vivaad kii sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 Last month, the city president of Hindu Yuva Vahini in Faizabad, Shambhunath Jaiswal, sought to make Yogi Adityanath, the MP from Gorakhpur, the chief ministerial candidate by putting up more than two dozen hoardings across the district
 'mishanh 2017—yogi nahin to vot nahin, desh main modi pradesh main yogi' jaise naaron vaali hording lagane ke baad bijepi or hindu yuva vahini kaaryakarta aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 The BJP, which won 71 seats from UP in the Lok Sabha Lok Sabha elections, has made the path of the next assembly elections in the state difficult
 janata or sanghathanaatmak kaaryon main ruchi na lene se kai saansad janata ke bich alokapriy hote ja rahe hai
 On July 4 last year, many mps did not even participate in the dharna organized in front of the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow against the SP government of the state
 rajyasabha ke teen saansadon ko milakar upi se bijepi ke kul 74 saansad hai
 MP from Kanpur Dr
 murali manohar joshi, gorakhpur se yogi adityanath, varun gandhi, kanvar singh tanvar, hukum singh, nepal singh, sakshi maharaj samet 30 se adhik saansad soochna paane ke baad bhi dharne se gaayab rahe
 Professor in the Department of Political Science of Lucknow University, Dr
 ramesh dikshit kehete hai, ''upi main modi lahar main jeetne vaale bijepi ke zyaadaatar saansad rajnatik rup se aparipakv hai
 The unpopularity of these mps in the Assembly elections may be overshadowed by the BJP
 ''pichley saal november ke antim saptaah main upi bijepi prabharee om maathur or rashtriya sah-sanghathan mahaamantri shiv prakaash ne saansadon ko sanghathan ke saath patari bithaane kii naseehat di thi
 How the advice of these leaders also proved to be ineffective, its poll was revealed to Narendra Modi himself
 14 march ko nai dilli main kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ke awaas par modi upi ke saansadon se mukhaatib the
 Modi asked, "how many villages have electricity reached since the formation of the BJP government at the Center?" No one had an answer
 aglaa prashn tha, ''kitne saansadon ke mobile main centre sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kii jaankaree dene vaala mobile ap he?'' kisi saansad kaa haath nahin uthaa
 In the state working committee meeting of Lucknow, the biggest challenge before the party that has given the slogan of 'gundai-no corruption', this time BJP government, is to overcome its internal issues

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Rajkot, Kutch and Anand district today (sunday)
 aanand pahunchepiem modine amul deyari plant kaa uddhatan kiya
 After this, PM Modi will also inaugurate the newly constructed Mahatma Gandhi Museum at Alfred High School in Rajkot
 bataa den ki mahatma gandhi ne 1887 main is skool se metric kii pariksha di thi
 After independence, this school was renamed Mohandas Gandhi High School
 adhikariyon dwaara ise museum main tabdeel karne ke uddeshy se 2017 main band kar diya gaya tha
 UPDATES- PM Modi said that the time has come that we should give importance to innovation and value addition
 hamaare desh main ek samay tha jab ham abhaav ke prabhaav main jite the
 Then the decision-making process of governance was different
 aaj hamaare saamne sankat abhaav kaa nahin he, aaj desh ke andar chunauti vipulata kii he
 - PM Modi said, i have told many dairies of Gujarat to also work on the sweet revolution, which is related to bees
 mujhe maaloom he ki banaas deyari or amarelli kii deyari ne is disha main saraahneey kaam kiya he
 i urge more dairy to pay attention to this
 - piem ne kaha, ham doodh prasanskaran main kaaphi acha kar rahe hai lekin ham isse behatar kar sakate hai
 i am confident that we will think in this direction
 yah nishchit taur par jaldi hoga
 - PM said, we are focusing on Jan Dhan, Van Dhan and Gobar Dhan
 isse kisaanon ko madad milegi
 Some time ago i went to Kutch and talked about the need to popularize camel milk there
 us samay logon ke ek samooh ne meraa majaak banaaya
 But today camel milk with camel milk is quite popular
 - piem modi ne kaha, lambey samay se, hamaare paas gandhinagar main baithe hue kuch aise log hai jo sahakaarita ko naapsand karte hai
 He prevented the region from gaining hold in Saurashtra
 - piem ne kaha, keval amul hi nahin uttari gujarat ke logon ne bhi sahakaari kshetra main kaam kiya he
 We have Banas Dairy, Dudhsagar Dairy
 in sabhi prayaason ne gujarat main khaastaur se kisaanon kii madad kii
 - The Prime Minister said, Pritam Rai Desai, directed by Sardar Patel, worked on a large scale cooperative housing in Ahmedabad
 in prayaason ne kai logon kii aakankshaon ko pankh die
 - PM Modi said, Sardar Patel joined politics a decade ago
 unhen dariyapur se jeet mili
 He won by only one vote
 jab unhone nagar nigam main offis sambhala to unhone shahari vikaas, yojana par jor diya or usamen sahakaari awaas par kaam kiya
 - PM said, great men like Sardar sowed the seed which has emerged as a model of the third economy today, where neither the government will take possession nor Dhanna Seth will take possession of it, it will be the cooperative movement, with the cooperation of farmers and citizens, that system will grow and every Someone will be his partner
 - piem modi ne kaha, aaj amul puri duniya main prerana ban gaya he
 People from abroad also ask me about Amul
 amul na keval doodh prasanskaran he balki yah shashaktikaran kaa ek utkrisht model ban gaya he
 - PM Modi said, the people of Anand have come in such large numbers to bless us
 main unhen garmjoshi or pyaar ke liye dhanyavad karata hum
 Today, development projects worth Rs 1,100 crore have either been inaugurated or their foundations have been laid
 iskaa bahut sakaaratmak prabhaav padegaa
 In the security agency alert mode, tell that security agencies are in alert mode before the Prime Minister's visit
 darasal, beete somvaar ko kuccha ke bhachaau tehsil ke chobaari ke paas se satellite phone ke signal milane se hadkamp much gaya tha
 After receiving the signal, the security agency was alerted and started investigating the whole matter
 narendra modi kaa loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan ek bada vaada kathith taur par videsh main jamaa kaale dhan ko lautaa laane kaa tha
 Even after assuming the post of Prime Minister, Modi kept saying many times that this hidden wealth can change the picture of development in the country and speed up the pace of economic growth
 unhen sansad main tikhe hamale bhi jhelane pade, jab sheetakaaleen satr main vipaksh ne unhen apana vaada na nibhaane ke liye aade haathon liya
 So, ten months after assuming power, the Union Cabinet on 20 March approved a new bill aimed at bringing back the lost wealth of the country
 lekin aghoshit videshi aay or sampatti (karadhaan) vidheyak, 2015 (yuafeity) jaise hi sansad main pesh kiya gaya, uski tikhi aalochanaayen hi zyada huin
 What is most striking in this bill to all people from the industry, is the unbridled powers given to the Income Tax Department, Directorate of Enforcement (ED), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and other departments
 akalan karne vaale adhikariyon ko aparaadh prakriya samhita (siarpisi) ke tahat kuch nyaayik adhikaar bhi de die gaye hai
 Not only this, the scope of interpretation is also left in some rules and procedures
 iske alaava isamen ek vyakti ko ek hi aparaadh ke liye kai tarah ke maamle chalaane ke raste bhi khol die gaye hai
 Hiding taxable income is generally considered a civil matter, but this bill of black money has made criminal cases by putting undisclosed money stored abroad as a crime

 C
 joshi ke mutabik ise faujadaari aparaadh banane kaa suzav kaale dhan ke maamalon kii nigaraanee ke liye supreme court ke nirdesh par modi sarkaar kii ore se gathit vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) kii ore se aayaa tha
 One provision in the Bill is to classify black money as a crime listed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki jaise hi adhikariyon ko kisi karadaata kii videsh main jamaa aghoshit sampatti yaa kamai ke strot kaa pataa chalegaa, piemele kanoon ke tahat karrwai shuru ho jaaegi
 It is a very stringent law and is usually implemented in cases of serious crimes such as drug and arms trafficking
 vitt mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik videsh main jamaa kaale dhan ko piemele kanoon ke tahat laane or use aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhane kaa ek makasad videsh se suchanaaen hasil karne kii koshish he
 Normally banks and government officials are not willing to share information under the provisions of the Double Taxation Prohibition Treaties, if there is no criminality involved
 haalanki, sibiditi ke purv sadsy es
 s
 khan kehete hai, ''nae prastaavit kanoon se (videsh main jamaa kaale dhan ke bare main) soochna yaa saboot paane ke nae daravaaje nahin khulenge
 For this, the authorities will have to depend on double taxation prohibition treaties and tax information exchange agreements
 ''kar visheshgy tathaa taxindia online dotcom ke sampadak shailendra kumaar kehete hai ki vidheyak ke praavdhaanon kii bhashaa or bhaawanaaon par gaur kiya jaae to pehali baar bharat main kaale dhan ko piemele jaise sakht kanoon ke tahat laakar sarkari gambhirtha dikhaai gai he
 However, experts fear that after taking the shape of this law, Inspector Raj will be returned to the tax system
 isaki mukhya vajah yah he ki vidheyak main kar akalan, jaanch-padtaal or apil (ayukta, panchat, hycourt yaa supreme court) ke liye vyapak kanoonee mashinari khadaa karne kaa prastaav he
 This machinery will do fine, prosecution in courts and tax collection
 yah kul milakar usee vyavastha kaa nayaa rup he jiskaa utpeeda aarthik udaarikaran ke pehle ke daur main anek log jhelte rahe hai
 Not only this, according to this bill, every jurist and in-charge of the business of a company entangled in the charge of tax evasion will be held guilty
 iskaa vyaavhaarik arth yah hua ki sirf company kaa maalik hi nahin, balki company ke sabhi aalaa adhikari kanoonee karrwai or sajaa ke hakdaar honge
 Experts say that under the proposed law, many types of legal procedures can be carried out against a person in a single year
 agar kisi maamle main do bhinn-bhinn kanoonon ke praavdhaanon ko mila diya jaae to use do tarah ke kar aakalnon ke alaava do tarah kii apil prakriya, dand prakriya or mukadmaa tak jhelana pad saktaa he
 Along with this, the ED can take separate action under the PMLA law
 kar visheshgy tathaa kansaltent form emicas raaras ke mukhiya somesh aroda kehete hai, ''is vidheyak (kaala dhan vidheyak) ko piemele se jodgaye kii koi tuk samaj main nahin aati kyonki vidheyak main kar ugaahne ke kade praavdhaan maujuud hai
 Apart from this, one can go to appeal only after depositing the amount of tax assessment after a certain level
 '' aroda kehete hai ki hajaaron aise maamle hai jinke liye idi ke paas jaanch-padtaal or karrwai karne kaa tarika nahin he
 He says, "why should the PMLA law be combined with more laws without clarifying the financial limits of the crime?" It is similar to finding the throat of someone according to the size of the hanging noose
 ''lekin vitt mantralay ke pravaktaa di
 s
 malik kehete hai ki vidheyak kaaphi sakht nahin hai kyonki isamen durupyog rokane kii khatir kai tarah ke upaay kiye gaye hai
 "taking care of compliance with natural justice and legal process, the bill has made it mandatory to provide notice before taking action against the accused person," he said in response to an India Today e-mail
 '' unke mutabik prastaavit kanoon main yah vyavastha he ki har sandigdh ko sunwaayee or saboot pesh karne kaa mauka diya jayega
 Provisions have been made to prevent misuse, recording every cause, ordering in writing and taking action within the time limit
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki vidheyak main videsh main aghoshit aamadani yaa sampatti rakhane vaale nivasee bharatiyon ko apni sampatti ghoshit karne, kar chukaane or jurmaana bharne kaa ek baar ekamusth avasar dene kaa prastaav he
 Instead they will not have to pay property tax on these assets and they will not have to face action and litigation under Income Tax law, Property tax law, Customs law, Foreign Exchange Management law and Company law
 lekin is yojana ke kargar hone par sirf saidhantik hi nahin, balki prakriyaagat sawaal bhi uthaae ja rahe hai
 Shailendra Kumar says, "it is not clear in the language of the bill whether the person declaring the undisclosed property will be asked about the source of the income or the property
 or agar koi gaiyr-kanoonee strot se aamadani kii baat kabool karata he to isaki koi guarantee nahin he ki yah maamla piemele kanoon ke tahat karrwai karne ke liye idi kii ore nahin bheja jayega
 "he warns," one might recall that after the VDIS (voluntary Income Proclamation Scheme) scheme was over, sales tax officials of some states sent notice of payment of tax on the amount received from the declared additional sales to some traders and firms
 gave
 ''lekin vitt mantralay ke malik jor dekar kehete hai ki yah koi aam maafee yojana nahin he kyonki isamen dand se chhot kii peshkash nahin he
 He says, "this is just an opportunity for people to clean up their debts and pay taxes before the strict provisions of the new law come into force
" '' haalanki kar vanchanaa kaa khulaasa karne vaali yojanaayen ab tak 12 baar- 1991 main aay udghoshnaa se lekar 1997 main vidiies tak-jari kii ja chuki hai or bahut safal nahin rahi hai
 The basic reason for this is the general belief that the government is unable to show seriousness in curbing tax evasion
 bharat main bade rasukhdaar or oonchi pahunch vaale log amuman bina kisi dand yaa jurmaane ke chhot jate hai
 Conversely, according to reports, the US has raised $ 5 billion in tax revenue through its offshore voluntary disclosure program
 isi tarah italy main 56 arab euro kii rakam waapas laane ke alaava 1
 Tax revenue of 4 billion euros has been raised
 so, aashcharya nahin ki in donon deshon ke alaava europe ke kai deshon ne apane iraade kii gambhirtha dikhaane ke liye kai bade rasukhdaar logon par karrwai kii
 The bill puts black money deposited in foreign accounts as a crime, but the government is still silent on the black money generated in the country
 vitt mantralay ke paas desh or videsh main kaale dhan ke bare main koi thos soochna nahin he
 He had tasked three government think tanks to assess the total amount of black money stashed in India and abroad and find out the reasons for its creation, but no report has been released till date
 baharhaal, bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke maamle main janata kii samvedansheeltaa ko dekhte hue kisi rajnatik dal se is vidheyak kaa puri tarah virodh karne kii ummid to nahin kii ja sakati, phir bhi sarkaar ko iske kuch vivaadaaspad praavdhaanon par jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 Incidentally, this is a Finance Bill so it will not be necessary to debate in Rajya Sabha
 ise nichle sadan loksabhaa main simit bahes main paarit kiya ja saktaa he
 According to some critics, the government is also trying to avoid any kind of protest

 a meeting of the Punjab cabinet was called on Monday
 jisamen siddhu ko mili badi raahat mili he
 Actually before the meeting, speculations were being made that some ministers may decide to raise the issue in the cabinet by meeting separately
 siddhuse yaa to bayaan waapas lene ko yaa maafee maangane ko kaha ja saktaa he yaa mantri pad se istife kii baat bhi manavaai ja sakati he
 However, no major decision could be taken on the issue
 punjab cabinet kii aaj kii baithak main siddhu ke 'koun he captain'' bayaan kaa mudda nahin uthaa
 Following strict instructions from the High Command, Captain Amarinder Singh and the Ministers of the Government of Punjab remained silent on Sidhu's case
 cabinet meeting main sirf routine mudde hi discus kiye gaye
 Several ministers including Aruna Chaudhary, Sadhu Singh, Sukhwinder Randhawa, OP Soni, Manpreet Badal arrived at the cabinet meeting at the residence of Captain Amarinder
 vahiin navjot singh siddhu aaj chunaav prachaar ke liye rajasthan ke nagaur main rahenge
 That is why he did not attend the meeting
 haalanki, aaj vah raily or press conference karenge
 Let me tell you that Sidhu recently made a statement that his Captain is not Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh but Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 jiske baad punjab sarkaar ke kai mantriyon ne siddhu kaa istipha maanga he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu gave the first clarification on the ongoing dispute with Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh before the 'do not wash dirty sheets in front of everyone'
 rajasthan ke jhalavad main media se siddhu ne kaha ki captain amarinder singh unke pita ke samaan hai, vah unka sammaan karte hai
 Whatever dispute is there, they will meet and resolve it
 is bich siddhu ne twit bhi kiya, ''bure din jane vaale hai, rahul gandhi aane vaale hai''

 After independence, Congress had the distinction of being with people of all religions and sects
 usne ise chunaavon main khub bhunaaya bhi
 This has been the case for many years, but gradually the system got the eye of other parties and the Congress's huge support base shifted
 90 kaa dashak aate-aate congress ke paale se dalit puri tarah se alag ho gaye
 He neither had strong Dalit leaders nor Dalit vote banks
 mayawati daliton kii sabase badi netri banakar ubharin or unhone unke vot bank ko jhatak liya
 As a result, he got tremendous success in UP

 Along with BJP, she also held the post of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 lekin samay ke saath unhone ek baat samaj lee ki agadi jatiyon kaa virodh karke vah taumr satta main bani nahin rah saktin
 So he resorted to social engineering and took the Brahmins with him
 yah krantikari kadam tha or logon ne ise badi hairaani se dekha
 The results of this were clearly visible in the election
 mayawati ne uttar pradesh jeet liya
 This was amazing of social engineering
 samay badal gaya he
 The BJP camp is no longer heard echoing the Ram temple
 party ko yah samaj main aa gaya he ki nayaa sameekaran banaakar vah kuch kar sakati he
 In this episode, he also started resorting to a new type of social engineering
 usne sabase pehle maharashtra main arpiai (athawale) kaa saath liya jo apane ko daliton kii hamdard party bataati he
 Influenced by Baba Saheb Ambedkar's ideology, there have been many pieces of this party, yet it has good influence in some pockets
 lekin ab ram vilaas paswan kii algepi ke uske saath aane kaa manshaa jataane se use bihar main ek saathi mil gaya he
 Paswan's party may not have done much in the last election, but it is true that his supporters are enough
 vah apane boote bhale hi vot bank main tabdeel na ho paae, lekin bijepi jaisi party ke saath milakar kai siton par prabhaav chhod sakati he
 After Paswan, now Dalit leader and former bureaucrat Udit Raj has also joined BJP
 vot kii raajnneeti main beshak unki koi khaas takat nahin he lekin vah ek pratik chinh ke taur par party ko suut karte hai
 This time the BJP has made an attempt for social engineering
 vah congress ke vot bank main send to lagaana hi chaahati he bahujan samaaj party jaisi partiyon ke samarthakon ko bhi ek sandesh dena chaahati he
 It is his intention to take this large population of the country along with him because his support will be needed to hoist the flag at the Red Fort

 unhone kaha, ‘unhen baatcheet karne dijie
 We should not guess in advance
 ham aapasi chintaaon kaa lekhajokha taiyaar karne se pehle moolyankan karenge
 Regarding Xi's statement that it is not easy to solve the boundary question easily, sources said that India has always said that its resolution will take time
 adhikariyon ne kaha, ‘hamane kabhi nahin kaha ki iskaa samaadhaan aasaan hoga
 'india has always felt that both countries should move in the direction of betterment in business and positive field
 unhone kaha, ‘ek mudde (seemaa) ko sambandhon ke aade nahin aane den
 The officials said that there is a positive message from the Indian side to the Chinese leadership

 congress kii dilli ikai ne jiesti ke virodh main 18 july ko sansad gheraav kaa elaan kiya he
 State Congress President Ajay Maken said that recently in Surat lakhs of people demonstrated against GST, it was not only the business class but also the employees and general public
 maakan ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne bhi jiesti kaa virodh isliye kiya he kyonki centre sarkaar ne jiesti ke 6 slab banaae hai or isamen 40 fisadi tak kii adhiktam seemaa tay kii he
 Whereas Congress wanted to levy GST with a maximum limit of 14%
 maakan ne kaha ki dilli kaa vyapaaree varg jiesti ke kaaran apane aapako thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe he
 Maken said that many business organizations in Delhi are telling the Congress party their problems
 congress pradesh adhyaksh ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki modi sarkaar ne scooter or marcides car parek samaan jiestilgaia he
 Maken said that Modi government imposes 28 percent GST on Mercedes car and applies the same on scooter
 bijepi kii inhen jan virdohi nitiyon ke kaaran ab party 18 july ko pradesh ke lakhon kaaryakartaaon or vyapaariyon ke saath milakar sansad kaa gheraav karegi
 From the beginning, the Congress party has been demanding to fix the maximum limit of GST
 party kii ore se pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki vah jiesti ke khilaaf nahin he lekin jis tareeke se centre sarkaar ne ise lagu kiya use lekarparty kii naaraazgi he

 bhartiya rigerv bank kii ore se nitigat daron main badhotaree ne mahange karj kii jameen taiyaar kar di
 But on the other hand it also opened the way for interest rates on deposits to rise
 beete ek hafte main desh do diggaj bainkon (esbiai or echdiefasi) chuninda avadhi ke phicsad diposit (epady) par milane vaale byaaj kii daron main badhotaree kii he
 Investing in fds is the most popular among risk-free options among investors
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki 5 saal se zyada kii epady karaane par tex benefit bhi miltaa he
 However, we recommend avoiding this investment
 epady karwaane se kyon bachein?-epady main nivesh jokhim rahit hota he
 But the returns on it are many times lower than inflation
 desh main nitigat daren (repo rate) nichle str par hoti hai to bank jamaa par byaaj daron ko gata dete hai
 In such a situation, the return on FD is less than that of inflation
 aisa koi bhi nivesh jo mahangaai kii tulana main kam ho paroksh rup se puunji kaa hraas karata he
 - Return on investment in FD is added as income, which is taxable
 agar koi niveshkarta kar yogya aay ke daayre main aata he to epady par milane byaaj uski aay or tex kii dendaree ko or badha detaa he
 Financial expert Jitendra Solanki says that the two reasons for not being able to return to inflation, and then the amount of return to be taxable, do not make investing in fds better
 aam niveshak isko nahin jaan pate hai
 They turn to fds due to features such as risk-free investment, anytime FD withdrawal facility
 epady nahin to vikalp kya?solanki maanate hai ki epady se zyada behatar hoga ki niveshak mutual funds main nivesh karen
 While there is an option for equity mutual funds for the long term, on the other hand, debt, liquid or ultra short term mutual funds can be switched for short to medium term
 isse niveshak ko sidhe taur par do phaayde honge
 First, the return on investment will be higher than FD
 vahiin duusari ore ritern par long turm capital gen tex kaa phayda milegaa
 Solanki says that there are a variety of options in different categories of mutual funds
 jahaan koi niveshak ek hafte, 6 maheene yaa phir kuch varshon ke liye bhi nivesh kar saktaa he
 Risk is also limited in debt mutual funds
 aise main niveshkon ke liye behatar hoga ki apane nivesh ke liye epady kaa rukh na karke mutual funds main uplabdh vikalp ko talaashen

 The drama that has been going on in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the last 24 hours is deemed to be over with the belief of Kumar Vishwas
 kejariwal and company kumaar ko manaane main kaamyaab rahi
 Not only that, showing confidence in them, he also gave them new responsibilities
 saath hi party ne kumaar vishwaas kii sharton ko bhi maan liya he
 It was decided to suspend Amanatullah
 aise main sawaal ye he ki is tamaam uthapatak main kumaar vishwaas ko kya mila? aap kumaar vishwaas ko manaane ke saath kin chizon ko apane tareeke se saadh gai
 That is, Kumar did not lose his 'faith' from the party and Kejriwal also put responsibilities on Kumar's shoulders for the next mission
 jimmedaari badhaakar khush karne kii koshish?jaahir he kikumar vishwasako bijepi kaa agent bataane vaale amanatullah ke khilaaf ection kaa faisla kumaar vishwaas kii sharton ko puraa karne ke liye hi kiya gaya he
 After Kumar agreed, Sisodia said that even though Vishwas is constantly saying that he has no greed for the post and the party, the party has made him in charge of Rajasthan, increasing his responsibilities
 kumaar vishwaas ko rajasthan kii jimmedaari dene kaa matlababta den ki rajasthan main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai auraam aadmi party yahi se daanv khelaa he
 Kumar Vishwas was constantly questioning the party leadership
 kejariwal ne unhen rajasthan kii jimmedaari dekar un par vishwaas dikhaaya he
 Kumar Vishwas does not have much time and will have to do something in Rajasthan
 varanaa kumaar ke khilaaf ek baar phir awaajen uthengi?rajasthan se kumaar vishwaas kaa he khaas rishtadusari ore prabharee banaae jane ke baad spasht he kirajasthan chunaav main aam aadmi partiki ore se kumaar vishwaas chunaav main mukhya cheharaa honge
 Kumar Vishwas has a special relationship with Rajasthan and his wife Manju Sharma is also from Chittorgarh, Rajasthan
 khud kumaar vishwaas rajasthan main gum-gum apni kavitaayen gaate rahe hai or unki apni fain phaloing he
 Vishwas's close association with his wife is that while going out after Kejriwal's house meeting, Kumar Vishwas and his wife were also present
 yani aane vaale dinon main party main unki bhoomika badhegi or kumaar vishwaas ke saath rajasthan main unki patni bhi morcha sanbhaalengi
 It can be said that the husband and wife set the pieces together
 yahi nahin 2014 ke aam chunaav main amethi se rahul gandhi or smriti irani ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke samay kumaar vishwaas ke saath unki patni bhi saath raheen
 That is, politics is not new for Manju Sharma and has been active behind the scenes for a long time
 rashtrawaad par spasht he vishwaas kaa vichaarhaal hi main rani padmini ko lekar hue vivaad main bhi kumaar vishwaas ne apane tareeke se hastkshep kiya or rani padmini par kavita gaakar unhone bhaawanaaon ko apane paksh main bhi modaa liya
 There is a different atmosphere in Rajasthan regarding patriotism and nationalism
 kumaar vishwaas ne jis tarah haal hi main jari kiye gaye video ko lekar maafee maangane se inkaar kiya
 Their tendency is also clear from that
 kaha ja saktaa he ki kejariwal and company ne kumaar vishwaas ko jimmedaariyaan dekar unhen saadhane kii koshish kii he
 At the same time, taking the charge of Rajasthan, Kumar Vishwas laid the foundation of making his height bigger in future
 agar rajasthan main kumaar vishwaas party ko aashaatheet safalataa dilaane main kaamyaab rahete hai, to unka kad badhegaa or phir kejariwal ke baraabar khadaa hone se unhen koi roak nahin saktaa
 In the drama that has been going on for the last two-three days, it came out that there was a faction of mlas along with Kumar Vishwas and on his instigation Kumar kept the pressure
 
 
 vishwaas ke maan jane ke baad unke samarthakon main banty mithaiyaan or jashn se saaf he ki kumaar vishwaas kaa gut baaji maar le gaya

 4 trillion dollars (rs 90 lakh crore), two-thirds of it is entirely dependent on cash
 desh main saamaan kharidne ke liye, sevaaon ko lene ke liye or selary aavanton main cash kaa bharpoor istemaal hota he
 Now, since the announcement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November, there is chaos in this two-thirds of the economy
 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency amaanya kii ja chuki he or 500 or hajaar kii nai note dhire-dhire arthvyavastha main pahunch rahi he
 Meanwhile, currency notes of 100 rupees and 50 rupees have become a commodity in themselves
 jarurat kii kharidari inhen karency se ho rahi he lihaaja log ise khulkar kharch karne se kataraa rahe hai
 Know where in the country the business is in cash and only in cash - most of the business of freight and public transport through trucks on transport and freight traffic is dependent on cash
 desh main chal rahe lakhon trek sirf or sirf cash iconomi par daud rahe hai
 Transport companies rely on cash to ship their trucks from one corner of the country to the other because of the cost of fuel, drivers and other staff on trucks, tolls and octroi taxes as well as malfunctioning of trucks during travel But the repair work only and only on the cache
 vahiin desh main public transport jaise train, bas, metro or shahari awamgan jaise auto, rickshaw cash vyavastha par hi puri tarah nirbhar hai
 Food and Grocery Market India's Food and Grocery Market is the sixth largest market in the world
 is kshetra main lagbhag 70 fisadi ritel kaarobaar he
 In the food and grocery market, small shopkeepers (retailers) and consumers shop on cash only and only
 iske sheersh par baithi galla mandiyon main cash kii shuruyaat tab hoti he jab kisaan apana anaaj lekar mandiyon main bechney pahunchataa he
 Farmers expect cash only for their flocks as modern banking means like checks, drafts, account transfers are not trusted
 iske alaava in mandiyon main bikwaali kai str par hoti he or aamtaur par kisaan or upabhokta ke bich teen-chaar bichauliyon kii maujuudagi rahata he jise cash vyavastha se hi phayda hota he
 Construction goods- Cement, rebar, sand, brick, etc
 In the construction sector, the common man has to depend entirely on cash for retail purchases like cement, rebar, sand, brick for construction of houses
 iske chalate puure real state par cash haaavee rahata he
 The direct impact of the currency crisis started on November 8 is visible on the cement and saria cell
 jahaan cement companiyaan maan rahi hai ki nai karency kii uplabdhta nahin hone se unki ritel bikri 50 fisadi se zyada gir gai he vahiin is sector kaa doosraa ahm utpaada saria kii sthiti zyada kharaab he
 Where the bulk sale of cement is done by check or draft but retail sales are completely dependent on cash, advance orders of bulk purchases are being postponed
 vahiin bazaar main saria puri tarah se cash par nirbhar he
 According to the salarywish Bank report in Labor and Unorganized Industry, about 1 million people join the workforce every month in India
 inamen se adhikansh badi-choti factriyon or real estate sector main bataur lebar shaamil hote hai
 Labor's daily wages in these sectors are completely dependent on cash till demonetisation
 shram mantralay ke mutabik desh main lebar ko pratidin ausatan dehadi 250 se 300 rupee tak milti he
 In this day, labor costs about 20 rupees per day for food, because usually 5-6 laborers get the money and shop for food
 lekin notebandi ke baad se desh main badi se badi company or chote se chote construction site par kaam lagbhag ruk gaya he kyonki sabhi ko karency kii samasya kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The result is that most of the labor is forced not to work because they have no choice but to work on credit
 iske chalate notebandi ke baad se zyaadaatar lebar apni jamaapunji par guzar-basar is ummid par kar rahe hai ki jald se jald cash kii samasya khatm ho jaae
 Jewelery and gold, silver are the current marriages of the country
 yah vakt jewelery ke tej kaarobaar kaa bhi tha
 But due to the decision of demonetisation, the purchase of gold, silver and jewelery in the country has also been in crisis
 faisla aate hi kuch logon ne apane aedcounted cash ko thikaane lagane kii koshish kii lekin yah tarkeeb bhi kuch ghanton se zyada safal nahin ho saki
 In fact, whether it was buying jewelery for marriage or buying gold and silver to secure unaccounted money, it was completely dependent on hard cash
 is sector main kharidaaron se cash milane ke chalate jewalers apane kaarobaari curent acount main badi maatra main cash jamaa karte the
 Apart from this, small and big jewelers also used to buy gold and silver in bullion market with the help of cash
 lekin notebandi ke faisle se jahaan graahakon ke saamne shaadi-vivaah jaise upkram ke liye jewelery kharidne kii chunauti khadi he vahiin jewalers bhi ab cash pement se bachane ke liye bullian market ko die advance order ko cancel karne par majaboor hai

 During this time, the Supreme Court said that this petition contained many reasons for the action taken against Asthana
 haalanki, inamen se zyaadaatar kaa janhit yachika se koi sambandh nahin he
 The court said that it contained many such things, some of which have nothing to do with the petition
 haalanki, kuch seva nyaayaadhikrnon ke adhikaar kshetron main aa sakate hai, lekin anya adhikaar kshetra main nahin he
 The petition was filed by petitioner ML Sharma in the petition against Asthana being made DG of BCAS
 court main sunwaayee ke dauraan unhone aarope lagaaya ki sivisi ne sibiai ko exiaar darj nahin karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The court told them that what is your point and in what context it is not clear
 kuch bhi or sab kuch nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Sharma then argued that Asthana was given the post of DG of BCAS and challenged the decision of the High Powered Committee of 10 January
 jiske baad court ne kaha ki ucchadhikaar praapt samiti ke nirnay kaa kisi bhi cheez se kya lenaa-dena he? iske baad court ne unki yachika khaarij kar di

 yahi nahin, centre ne asthana ke kareebi maane jane vaale teen anya adhikariyon kaa kaarykaal bhi samaapt kar diya tha
 Let us tell you that the fight erupted due to the bitterness between the former CBI director Alok Verma and the second place in the hierarchy, Rakesh Asthana
 jiske baad 23 oktober ko centre ne asthana or alok verma se unke adhikaar chin kar unhen jabaran chuttee par bhej diya tha
 Actually, the two officials had accused each other of corruption

 beete shanivaar dilli ke basantkunj main sadak ke gadde main girane se hui ek shaks kii maut ke baad laaparvaahee baratane vaali agenciyon par karrwai to nahin hui lekin kejariwal sarkaar or dilli police ke bich aarope pratyarope kaa khel jarur shuru ho gaya he
 Accusing PWD of not allowing road pits to be fixed, Minister Satyendra Jain said that the police business is to ask people for money
 sadakon ke gaddhon kii marammat main rukaawat daalane kii baat ko jab dilli police ne nakaara, tolfthdh mantri satyendra jainase kai sawaal puche gaye-1
 The police rejected your claim that permission is not required for small maintenance? Answer: Permission is never needed
 dilliki sadaken PWD khud thik kar saktaa he
 But the traffic police and Delhi Police confiscated their vehicles and did not let them work
 8 july, 14 july or 21 july ko police ko patr likhaa
 2
 kya kaaran tha PWD kii gaadi rokane kaa?jawaab:ho saktaa he paise chaahate hon
 Their business is to ask people for money
 kisi se bhi maang sakate hai

 dilli police or sarkaarake aarope-pratyarope ke bich ek aadmi kii maut kaa jimmedaar koun?jawaab:letters likhe to kyon karrwai nahin hui
 We wrote that your people are harassing and are not allowing you to work
 magistrate jaanch baitha di gai he
 Whose fault will be taken
 4
 When will the road pits be corrected? Answer: Out of 30 thousand roads in Delhi, 1260 km is near PWD
 sadak par gadde hai to 1077 kol kar sakate hai turant thik kar denge
 No Deadline Required
 PWD ho, DDA yaa MCD, jis agency ke ilaake main jo sadak aati he vahaan ke gadde ko thik karne kii jimmedaari aadhikarik agency kii hi hogi
 How will Delhi become a world class city? On one hand, the Kejriwal government claims to make the country's capital a world class city, on the other hand, the condition of Delhi's roads is nothing short of a scary dream
 ring road shahar ke bade bade ilaakon se hokar guzarati he lekin iske baavjood agenciyaan gaddhon ko nazarandaaj kar rahi hai
 When the questions were raised on the government, AAP leader Dilip Pandey was asked, he said that 'the person did not die due to being trapped in the pit but because the truck climbed up
 PWD ke paas 1250 kilometre sadak he jise wo menten kiye hue hai
 And the people of PWD will take care that there are no pits
 'philhal ye gadde bike chaalkon ke liye sabase badi musiibat ban gaye hai
 The most busy ones are the pits on the Ring Road passing through the Kale Khan bus station and near the railway station, it is also filled with rain water
 bike chaalkon kaa kahana he ki ab sadak par chalate hue dar lagata he
 The government should give serious attention to the work of repairing the pits

 After Aam Aadmi Party's major defeat in the Municipal Corporation elections in Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party leader in Punjab and MP from Sangrur, Bhagwant Mann has also blamed the party's wrong strategy and high command for the defeat in the Punjab Assembly elections

 But why were these posters taken down and why Bhagwant Mann is pursuing rebellion
 in sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke liye bhagwant maan ke ghar par koi bhi maujuud nahin he
 Bhagwant Mann's car is parked outside the house, but Bhagwant Mann is inside the house or he is somewhere else, or no one is coming out from Punjab to tell about this
 gauratlab he ki bhagwant maan ne apana mobile bhi switch of kar liya he
 So in Punjab, Leader of Opposition and AAP leader HS Phoolka has also blamed the big leaders of Delhi for the defeat

 ) After taking oath as Chief Minister, Uddhav Thackeray announced a cabinet meeting of Rs 20 crore for the construction of Shivaji Fort in Kirayagarh - said the government will work for the prosperity of farmers on Thursday after the political struggle in Maharashtra for more than a month
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has formed a government with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress Party
 unhone mumbai ke shivaji park main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 Six ministers were also sworn in with him
 shivasena ke cote se ekanath scindia or subhash desai ne mantri pad kii shapath lee, to ensipi cote se chagan bhujabal or jayant patil ne shapath lee
 Apart from this, senior leaders Bala Saheb Thorat and Nitin Raut have been made ministers from the Congress quota
 guuruuvaar ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene or sarkaar banane ke fouran baad uddhav thakare ne cabinet kii baithak kii
 Several decisions were taken at the first cabinet meeting of the Uddhav Thackeray government
 uddhav thakare sarkaar kii pehali cabinet kaa pehla faislis baithak ke badaudhav thakrene kaha ki yah sarkaar aam janata ke liye kaam karegi
 The blessings of the public should remain
 uddhav thakare ne raigarh ke shivaji kile ko sanvaarane kaa bhi elaan kiya he
 He informed that the first decision taken by this cabinet is to sanction Rs 20 crore for the development of Raigad, which was the capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

 In fact, since the election results came, the Shiv Sena and the BJP were cold-headed for the post of Chief Minister
 chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad se shivasena ne thaan liya tha ki is baar mukhyamantri uskaa hi hoga
 Due to this insistence of Shiv Sena, alliance with BJP was broken, then a new alliance was formed with NCP and Congress
 guuruuvaar shaam ko mumbai ke shivaji park main maharashtra kii raajnneeti kaa itihaas rachaa ja rahaa tha
 This was the first time when Congress and NCPK flags were also being waved along with Shiv Sena's saffron

 ' deraa sachcha sauda kaa pramukh gurmeet ram rahim bhale hi jail kii salaakhon ke peeche ho, lekin use haniprit se lekar deraa kii sampatti tak kii chintaa sata rahi hai
 Baba Bachman is in jail
 raat ko use neend nahin aati
 The peace of his day is also blown
 ab uskaa ek purana saathi uski ye baicheni dur karne main laga hua he
 With the help of which Baba is preparing the strategy ahead
 rohtak kii jail main band gurmeet ram rahim singh insa baichaiyn he
 He has many types of tension
 hanipritse lekar gaddi tak kii chintaa use sata rahi he
 He is worried about the property of crores and the seat of the dera
 ek ke baad ek baba ke karnaamon ke khul rahe chitthey ne bhi uski mushkilen badha rakhi hai
 In such a situation, Baba wants to understand every legal trick that can save the camp
 baba kaa vakil gurdas singh usase milane rohtak kii sunaaria jail pahunchaa
 Gurdas Singh called on Baba for about an hour
 jiske baad wo gaadi se mohali kii ore nikal gaya
 Let us tell you that Gurdas Singh often comes to Rohtak Jail to meet Baba
 or wo naa sirf ram rahim kaa vakil he balki uskaa kareebi bhi mana jaataa he
 Gurdas Singh is the same person who was carrying his suitcase while being brought to jail on 25 August after Ram Rahim was convicted
 jisaki khabaren media main chalane ke baad haryana sarkaar ne gurdas singh ko pad se hataa diya tha
 In such a situation, Gurdas not only gives law advice to Baba but also helps Baba in personal opinion
 jail main sajaa kaat rahe baba ke saamne samasyaon kaa ambara hai
 Baba is taking advice from Gurdas
 masalan deraa kaa uttaradhikari kise banaaya jaae
 Although the first name in this list was of Honeypreet, but after that the speculation of Ram Rahim's son Jasmeet to become the Dera chief started intensifying
 phir khabar ai ki abhi baba khud dere kii kaman apane haathon main hi rakhega
 If sources are to be believed, Baba is seeking legal opinion in this regard
 bhale hi jasmit insa ke deraa pramukh banane kii khabaren ai hon lekinram rahimahaniprit ko bhi naaraaz nahin karnaa chahta kyonki use pataa he ki haniprit kii naaraazgi use kanoonee rup se bhi mahangi pad sakati hai
 Honeypreet knows every secret of Baba well
 haniprit abhi to munh par taala lagaae baithi he
 The police has failed to extract any big secret from him
 ram rahim apane vakil gurdas se ye bhi jaanane kii koshish main laga hua he ki agar haniprit ne munh kholaa to wo uske liye kitni badi samasya khadaa kar saktaa he
 The third problem for Ram Rahim is the wealth of the dera
 jise bachaana he
 Here too, his only support is Gurdas, who understands the legal bets well
 saaf hai gurmeet ram rahim salaakhon ke peeche hai
 But the worry of Honeypreet, Dera's throne and the wealth of the Arabs has kept her restless

 If you have seen Vivo V9, then you will be able to relate it to that smartphone in the design
 haalanki company ne is baar rier panel par kaam kiya he or ise pehle se zyada premium banaaya he
 It is easy to hold and also has a good feel to use
 yah phone slee yani patala he or isamen blike aluminium frem kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The back of the smartphone is of glass and its ends are curved at the back so that it is quite easy to hold
 dayee taraf walue rocker kies or lock batan hai, jabaki bain taraf koi bhi batan nahin miltaa he
 Right next to the USB jack in the SIM and memory card tray bottom
 rier panel par aapako dual vertical camera seoup miltaa he jiske neeche esaidi flash he
 The lack of USB Type c is missing, because USB 2 in it
 0 diya gaya he
 There is a speaker grill next to it
 front kii baat karen to yahaan aapako 90 fisadi disple milti he or upar noch diya gaya he jisamen sensor he jo andhere main aapako dekh kar analock hota he
 The headphone jack has been given in the top of the phone
 kul mila kar is smartphone kii bild quality or dizin premium he
 Display Vivo X21 has a full HD Plus display, which looks quite good to see
 company ne amolade panel yuj kiya he
 The display looks colorful and bright
 The bezel is kept to a minimum, is negligible
 diarect sanlite main bhi screen ke contant achche se dekh or pard sakate hai
 The display also has a notch like the iphone x where the company has installed a sensor which is for Face Unlock
 yaheen selfi camera or flash bhi he
 Display Size 6
 28 inch he or aspect reshyo 19:9 kii he
 This time the company has also given Always On Display, which you can customize according to your own
 olves on disple main aap notifications or time dekh sakate hai
 It looks good because the display is better
 sabase acchhee baat ye he ki disple ke neeche kii taraf fingerprint ikon dikhataa he jo olves on kii tarah hi he
 You have to unlock the phone by placing your finger here
 yahaan aapako teen dilachasp anemation bhi milte hai jo dekhne main kaaphi behtareen hai
 Performance Now let's talk about how this smartphone performs in real life
 Vivo X21 main company qolkom snapadragon 660 procesar diya he
 It has a variant in India which has 128GB internal memory with 6GB of RAM
 haalanki procesar flagship nahin he, lekin rosemara ke istemaal main hamen is baat keem mahasoos nahin hui
 One thing is also that Snapdragon 845 processor has been given in oneplus 6 of this budget, which is the flagship
 Vivo X21 lag nahin karata he or ek ap se duusare ap main switch karnaa aasaan he
 The loading time is short and this phone is also better for multi tasking
 mid range chipset hone ke baavjood yah smartphone acha parform karata he
 For this, the RAM and internal memory given in it are also responsible
 is smartphone par hamane kai lite or heavi game khele hai, lekin koi lag notice nahin kiya he
 However after playing the Asphalt 8 for a while the phone heats up
 ek saath lagbhag darjanon eps ko becoground main rakhkar soshal media or browjing bhi kii he or isamen bhi koi lag nahin mila
 Because of 128GB internal memory, you can keep apps and files wherever you want, because the user gets enough memory
 micro esady card se bhi aap memory badha sakate hai
 After about 10 days of use, we can say that even if there is no Snapdragon 845 in it, even the end user, you will not see any significant difference
 haa agar aap power yujar hai, heavi yujar hai to aapako fark jarur samaj aayega
 Under Display Fingerprint Scanner Since this technology is new, we have also reviewed it
 aam standard smartfones main yaa to front main yaa back panel par fingerprint scinar miltaa he, lekin is divaais main disple par hi fingerprint scinar he
 In the box below the display, you will see an icon which can be pressed and open the phone
 fingerprint register karne main thodaa vakt lagata he
 Can scan more than one finger
 analock karne ke liye aapako sahi tareeke se finger place karke hold karnaa hota he
 The animation will appear as soon as you hold a few seconds and the phone will unlock
 hamen kai baar ise analock karne main kuch atempts lene pade yani ek baar main nahin khulaa, lekin zyaadaatar baar yah analock hota he
 If the company fixes it with a software update, it is a good thing or else it can become a problem for many users
 yujar interfessoyah smartphone android 8
 The company based on 1 Oreo runs on its own skin
 is smartphone main iphone x jaisaa hi jescher saport bhi diya gaya he or dilachasp ye he ki yah kaam bhi shandaar karata he
 After Nokia i think now slowly the Android smartphone companies will shift towards gestures, because gestures are easy to use
 yujar interphes company ke duusare hai and smartphone jaisaa hi he
 Camera Vivo X21 has a dual rear camera and a single selfie camera
 camera seoup vertical he or primericamera 12 megapixl kaa he jisame f / 1
 8 aperture is given
 doosraa camera 5 megapixl kaa he jiskaa aparchar f / 2
 4
 selfi ke liye isame 12 megapixl kaa camera diya gaya he jo f / 2
 0 is aperture
 camera interphes kii baat karen to yahaan aapako kai opshan milte hai
 These include portrait mode, live photos, HDR, flash and setting icons
 bottm main phase beauty, video jaise fitures hai
 Selfies can be improved through Face Beauty
 selfi bhi potrade mod par rakh kar clic kii ja sakati he
 AR stickers are also given which work fine
 agar aap profeshnal photographer nahin hai to aapako is smartphone se clic kii gai sabhi tasviren shandaar lagengi
 If you look at the photo on the computer, the detailing will also be seen, even if you zoom, the quality is not bad
 ise khaasiyat kaha ja saktaa he
 Bokeh effect i
e
 background blur clicked photos also looks good, but for better photos that are in detail, you have to turn off portrait mode
 echdiaar mod badhiya he or uljhi hui tasveeron main bhi echdiaar achche se kaam karata he
 The camera does not perform as well under low light, more grain and noise will be found
 kul mila kar is smartphone kaa camera department badhiya he or yah company ke daavon par khara utarataa he
 The camera sample battery Vivo X21 has a 3,200mah battery and it supports fast charging, which the company calls dual engine fast charging
 darasal ye qolkom quick charge he
 Its battery runs throughout the day in full use with full charge
 haalanki heavi yuj bhi kar rahe hai to 10 ghante tak aapako byaap milegaa
 Heavy use means browsing, watching videos, gaming and more use of social media
 kya aapako ye smartphone khareednaa chahie?is segment main kuch duusare smartphone hai jo ise takkar dete hai inamen se ek he oneplus 6 jise bharat main haal hi main launch kiya gaya he
 The specification and camera of oneplus 6 are much better and because of this, it falls heavily on it
 lekin agar aapako ek kadam aage kii technology disple ke andar fingerprint scinar chahie to market main iske alaava aapako paas doosraa opshan he hi nahin
 If you are a fan of Vivo, you cannot miss it
 under disple fingerprint scinar ke alaava overol bhi yah smartphone behtareen he

 He replied that the Prime Minister is making this appeal to him when he is mourned
 raaj kehete hai, ‘unhone samamuch unhen jhidak diya tha
 Shastriji must have felt ashamed, because Indira said this in my presence

 Jai says, 'I thought honestly that Indira Gandhi was the right person to join the new cabinet
 ’vah likhte hai, ‘jab indira gandhi ko ahsaas hua ki unki buaa vijay lakshmi mantri ban sakati hai, tab unhone mujhe se shastri ji se mulaakaat kaa samay tay karwaane ke liye kaha

 *indira gandhi ne sarvapalli radhakrishnan ko duusari baar raashtrapati banane se roka tha or unki jagah jakir hossain ke naam ko aage badhaayaa

 * Going to London, Nehru once asked his barber if he needed anything
 usne kaha, ‘sar kabhi-kabhi main deree se pahunchataa hum kyonki mere paas koi ghadi nahin he
 If you get it then it will be very good
 ’ nehru ne uske liye landan main ghadi kharidi or use bhent kiya

 aarushi-hemraj hatyakandake aaj paanch saal puure ho gaye hai
 This shocking incident took place on 16 May 2008
 itane lambey samay se aarushi ko ab bhi insaaf kaa intjaar he
 On the other hand, Ghaziabad's CBI court has granted Aarushi's parents and the murder accused Rajesh and Nupur Talwar two days to file their appeals in the Allahabad High Court
 agar elahabaad hoicourt se unhen 2 din main raahat nahi milti he, to unhen gajiabad court main pesh hokar apana bayaan darj karana hoga
 The court pulled up the Talwar couple and said that since May 6, the trial of the case has been postponed continuously, which is not right
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki aropiyon kii suvidha ke hisaab se maamle kii sunwaayee nahin chal sakati he
 The court clearly said that they have to record their statement under section 313 on May 17, else their bail can be canceled
 sibiai ne talwaar danpati par hatya kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Though the Talwar couple are constantly trying to prove their innocence, the police and the CBI have some strong evidence that are clearly pointing towards the Talwar couple
 aarushi hatyakand ab tak16 may 2008 ko aarushi kii hatya ke baad uske pita rajesh talwaar 23 may 2008 ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 This high profile case left the police under control
 police baar-baar bayaan badalati rahi or cese kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch paa rahaa tha, jiske baad 31 may 2008 ko cese sibiai ke supurd kar diya gaya
 In June, Rajesh Talwar's compounder Krishna was arrested by the CBI
 10 din baad talwaar ke dost ke naukar rajkumaar or vijay mandal ko bhi police ne hiraasat main le liya
 The CBI was investigating, but in December 2010 the CBI finally got tired and a closure report was filed saying that it suspected Rajesh Talwar, but there was no evidence against him
 uske baad talwaar danpati is closer report ke khilaaf court chale gaye
 The court also rejected the report and in a dramatic development re-issued summons to the Talwar couple and the CBI was ordered to rehear the case
 farvari 2011 main gajiabad kii special court nerajesh talwaar or nupur talwaar par trialshuru karne ke aadesh die sibiai court ne adaalat main maujuud naa rahane par talwaar danpati ke khilaaf gaiyr-jamaanti warrant jari kar diya
 Nupur Talwar was arrested in April 2011
 aakhirkaar may 2011 main court ne rajesh talwaar or napur talwaar par hatyakand ko anjaam dene or saboot mitaane kaa aarope tay kar diya
 Nupur Talwar got bail in September 2011
 april 2013 main sibiai ke adhikari ne court main kaha ki aarushi or hemraj kii hatya talwaar danpati ne hi kii he
 The CBI also told the court that Aarushi and Hemraj had met in an objectionable state
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne 3 may ko special court ke saamne apil kii ki vah 14 hawahon ko court main bulaae
 The CBI opposed this appeal
 6 may 2013 ko talwaar kii is arji ko trial court ne khaarij kar diya
 Also ordered to record the statements of Rajesh and Nupur
 13 may ko supreme court ne talwaar dampatti ko kadi fatkaar lagaate hue unki arji ko khaarij kar diya
 Overall the date went on, but Aarushi is still waiting for justice

 Tarun Tejpal of Tehelka, who has been accused of sexual exploitation with his own team's female journalist, is now almost impossible to escape from the law
 7 november, 2013, shanivaar ko goa ke is five star hotel main tahalaka kaa think fest chal rahaa tha
 Many famous faces of the world were part of this fest, including Tehelka editor-in-chief and noted journalist Tarun Tejpal
 or inhen namchin chehron ke bich ek cheharaa us gumnaam ladki kaa bhi tha, jo ai to thi is fest main apni duty nibhaane, lekin isse pehle kii wo apana ferj adaa kar yahaan se lautati, wo khud apane hi bos tarun tejpal ke napak iraadon kaa shikaar ban gai
 According to the girl, Tejpal tortured not one, but two or two times and threatened the bad consequences of opening his mouth
 tahalaka kii managing editor shoma choudhary se kii gai shikaayat ke baad jab is ladki ne goa police ko apane saath beeti puri kahani bataai, to sunne vaale bas sunate hi rah gaye
 Because it was that face of Tejpal, which nobody had seen till now
 goa police ko die ladki ke bayaan ke mutabik, us raat jab vah ek guest ko uske kamare tak chhod kar waapas laut rahi thi, to isi hotel ke block 7 ke ek lift ke saamne use uske bos tarun tejpal mil gaye
 Tejpal suddenly asked the guest to wake him up and dragged him back inside the same lift, but now this girl could understand that in the meantime, Tejpal started pressing the elevator button so that neither the elevator stopped nor the door Open
 or tab tejpal ne isi band lift main jo kuch kiya, jab uske raaj khule to aksar apane sting oparation or khulaason kii badaulat siyaasi halkon main tahalaka machaane vaale tarun tejpal kii jindagi main hi tahalaka much gaya
 In a statement given to the Goa Police, a good friend of Tejpal's daughter, the victim told that Tarun Tejpal then started molesting her in the lift
 tejpal kii ye harakat uske liye jitna bada jhatka tha, kahin usase bhi bada sadma, kyonki ab tak wo tejpal ko apane pita kaa dost maanati rahi thi or khud tejpal kii beti uski acchhee dost he
 According to the victim girl, when Tejpal was torturing her in a closed lift, she was crying about these relationships
 or to or usne tejpal ko unki beti se apni dosti kii yaad dilaai, lekin tejpal ke sir par jaise koi bhoot savaar tha
 The situation became such that when the lift stopped after a while, he somehow managed to get out of the lift by taking care of his clothes, but this was not the end of this girl's troubles
 duusari baar bhi lift main hi kii chhedhkhanius raat to is ladki ne apane phone par apane bwoyfrand ke alaava doston ko is vaakye ke bare main bataaya, lekin agle din mauka milte hi phir se usee hotel kii ek lift main tejpal ne uske saath vahi harakat doharaai or ab uske liye ye sabakuch bardaasht se baahar ho chukaa tha
 And after this, this girl told her best friend and Tejpal's daughter the complete misdeeds of her father
 lekin jaanate hai, tab tejpal kii beti ne kya jawaab diya, ladki kii maane to usne kaha ki usne pehle bhi apane pita ko tab ek duusari aurat ke saath aisa karte dekha tha, jab uski umr sirf 13 saal kii thi
 Till now only talk was being done about sexual exploitation
 ilzaam lag rahe the, ilzaamon kaa jawaab dhundha ja rahaa tha
 But whatever happened now is sure to be overshadowed by Tarun Tejpal

 Tejpal is being defamed by raising the consent point
 usne think fest main maujuud tahalaka ke sahakarmiyon se baatcheet kaa byoraa bhi diya he
 Apart from this, he has also submitted a copy of SMS and email sent to Tejpal
 bayaan main ladki ne ye bhi kaha he ki managing editor shoma choudhary ne uski koi madad nahin kii
 Rather, pressure was also made on Tejpal's relatives not to give a statement to the police
 goa kii bijepi sarkaar par fansaane ke aaropagova police ke mutabik, ladki kii shikaayat or magistrate ko diya bayaan ghatana ke baad tahalaka prabandhan ko bheje i-mail se match karte hai
 Tejpal may change his statement about the incident, but the victim girl is adamant on his statement
 goa police apni taraf se shuruaati tafteesh or tejpal par kanoonee shikanja kasne kii puri kar chuki he
 But Tejpal and his close ones say that they are being implicated and this is being instigated by the BJP government of Goa
 lekin goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ne un aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya
 However, the answer to the question of the Chief Minister's arrest was deferred
 ye kehete hue ki ye police kaa maamla he or ise un par hi chhod dena behatar he
 Action has begun
 tejpal ke goa police ke saamne hajir hone kaa saman bhi jari ho chukaa he
 Police say that if Tejpal ignores summons, a non-bailable warrant will be issued against him

 The case of rape was registered by the Goa police after Tejpal's sexual abuse case
