 Entering this stone garden is to recognize the world with a new eye
 yah samajhnaa he ki hamaare aasapaas bikhri jo bhi chizein hai, jinhen ham bekaar, bemaani, asundar, anupayogi maanakar apane jivan se dur kar dete hai, unako chahen to apane sparsh se kuch or bana sakate hai, unamem ek jivan, ek spandan daal sakate hai
 Incidentally we are living in a world where sensitivity to beauty is decreasing
 har shai- khud sundarataa bhi- bas upbhog or kareed-bikri kaa saamaan ho gai he
 Everything is charged at a price, weighed and discarded after work
 hamaare jane-anjaane hamane puri sabhyataa ko apane upbhog ke kabad main badal daalaa he
 But in the same junk, a man descends, discovers the shape of the stone in the movement and the shapeless things, and gradually builds and settles a garden in which stone flowers bloom, stone trees grow, stone birds
 Chirps play, stone creatures and waterfalls flow
 yah ek kalakaar kaa jaadu he, jisane pattharon ko, or bahut saare phaltu kabad ko is tarah dekha ki ve saans lene lage, unke bal ug aae, or vah hamase aankh se aankh milakar baat karne lage
 The comments hamaara samay lagaataar badhate hue patharilepan kaa samay he- mahapraan niraala kii vednaa kii tarah kaa- aaj jivan bah gaya he, ret jyon tan rah gaya he
 If there is any retaliation of this stone-like truth, this sandiness, it is within art, within sensation
 yah kala sookhti ja rahi he, yah samvednaa marati ja rahi he, kyonki ham unhen dekhte bhi hai to bas sailaani nigahon se, or aage bad jate hai
 i wish that we would stop, look and understand that if this life is valuable then we build it in our own way, give it shape and shape, give it name and identity
 yah samvednaa na ho to jivan pathar ho jaataa he or agar ho to pathar bhi saans lene lagata he

 We knowingly and unknowingly have turned the entire civilization into a junk of our consumption
 lekin isi kabad main ek aadmi utarataa he, pattharon main harqat or beakaar chizon main aakaar khojataa he or dhire-dhire ek aisi bagiya bana or basaa daalata he, jisamen pathar ke phool khilte hai, pathar ke ped-paudhe ugte hai, pathar kii chidiya chahakati he, pathar ke jeev-jantu khelte hai or pathar ke jharne behate hai
 This is the magic of an artist who saw stones, and a lot of extra junk, in such a way that they began to breathe, their hair grew, and he talked to us eye to eye
 tippaniyan Our time is a time of ever-growing stonyness - like the pangs of the mahaprana nirala - Today life has flowed, the sand has remained as it is
 is pathar jaisi sachai kaa, is retilepan kaa agar koi pratikaar he to vah kala ke bheetar he, samvednaa ke bheetar he
 This art is drying up, this sensation is dying, because even if we see them, the tourists just move on, and move on
 kaash ki ham ruken, dekhen or samajhen ki yah jivan agar moolyawaan he to isliye ki ham use apni tarah se gadhate hai, rup or aakaar dete hai, naam or pahchaan dete hai
 If this sensation is not there then life becomes a stone and if it is, then the stone also starts breathing
 hamaara samay lagaataar badhate hue patharilepan kaa samay he- mahapraan niraala kii vednaa kii tarah kaa- aaj jivan bah gaya he, ret jyon tan rah gaya he

 According to Stockholm-based SIPRI, which estimates the 1990 dollar-value import data, India's total arms imports during the five years (2010-2014) have been slightly more than $ 21 billion, the second-most
 Major importers are nearly three times Saudi Arabia

 unhone kaha, ‚Äòumesh yadav or mohammad shami jis str par khel rahe hai, unhen koching kii jarurat nahin he
 They do not have to tell the basics

 ‚Äôgrih mantri ne kaha, ‚Äògrih mantralay ne eemaandaaree se atarni general ko yah jaankaree de di he

 agar aap kisi ke saath apane sambandhon ko khatm kar rahi hai to ho na ho uski koi badi vajah to hogi hi
 This is especially true in the context of women
 wo ek baar jab kisi ke saath rishta jodatii hai to use ant tak nibhaane kii koshish karti hai
 But if a woman is taking the initiative and ending the relationship, then there will be a serious reason behind it
 haalanki apwaad har jagah hote hai or use nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Yet women are more sensitive than men to relationships
 agar aap kisi ke saath relationships main hai or is rishte ko ek paaydaan aage lekar janaa chaahati hai lekin man hi man main dari hui hai to ekbar phir sochie

 Indra Kumar's multistarrer film Total Dhamaal is a similar film
 film ke trailor se hi saaf ho gaya tha ki is film main logic or tark vitark kii sambhaavna naa ke baraabar hogi lekin ye bhi sach he ki ye indra kumaar hi hai jo 'dil' or 'ishk' jaisi mazedaar romantic kamedi filmein bhi bana chuke hai par total dhamal kisi bhi myne main acchhee kamedi film ke taur par apni jagah nahin bana paati
 The story of the film keeps Chori's money commissioned by Boman Irani in a hotel, but Ajay Devgn as Guddu and Sanjay Mishra as Johnny appear to have the money and steal it

 ye durbhaagya hi he ki arshad varsi or javed jaafaree jaise talented kalakaaron ko aisi script par ashrith hona pad rahaa he jahaan ve apni comic timming ke baavjood hansaane main naakaamayaab rahete hai
 Ajay Devgan had shown in Golmaal that he can do comedy with a good script, with this film he also proved that he is ineffective if not a good film
 film ummid ke mutabik hi chalati rahati he or isamen koi shwking factor nahin he
 Sanjay Mishra keeps going bro-bro throughout the film and finding depth in his role is a disappointment
 film ke dauraan kai baar aisa bhi feel hota he ki is frenchizi kii pehali film ko dekh rahe hai
 However, this film does not look as effective as Dhamaal and just a few scenes in the pieces are good
 is film ko dekhakar baar-baar sirf indra kumaar ke filmon ke graph main girte str par hairaani hoti rahati he
 Indra Kumar has given the iconic song 'dhak-dhak' featuring Madhuri Dixit and Anil Kapoor in the film Beta and only Madhuri Dixit and Anil Kapoor's chemistry in this film is worth watching

 Hollywood star Monkey Crystal also appears alongside Ajay in the film

 unhone kaha ki said ko yahaan se bhaagna bhi padaa
 Bablu Khan said that some fundamentalists, who do not want to have mutual harmony in Ayodhya, need to be careful with such people

 bharat or dakshin africa ke bich tii20 series kaa aakhri match guuruuvaar ko kolkata main khelaa jayega
 Team India has nothing to lose in the match
 aise main plaing ilevan main kya is baar koi badlaav dikhegaa? yah sawaal har fain ke jahan main uth rahe honge
 If we look at the practice session of Team India before the match, then the picture is getting clear
 abhyaas seshan ke dauraan do khilaadi maidan par sabase zyada pasinaa bahaate najar aae
 The first player is Stuart Binny and the second player is Ajinkya Rahane
 rahane ko ambati raidu kii vajah se team se baahar rakhane ke liye captain emes dhoni kii khub aalochana ho chuki he
 Looking at this, the captain may have changed his mind and made up his mind to give Rahane a chance
 raidu ab tak khele donon tii20 maichon main khaataa bhi nahin khol sake hai
 In such a situation, he is certain to be out of the team
 harbhajan singh ne rahane kii tarif ke pul jarur baandhe, lekin khilne ke bare main chuppi saadh lee
 Harbhajan said, "rahane is a good player but the team management will take the final decision on his playing
 ' All agree that Rahane is an expert T20 batsman but his figures for IPL and international matches show different picture
 rahane ne ipel ke 81 maichon main 2195 ran banaae hai lekin antarrashtriya tii20 maichon main unka pradarshan ausat rahaa he
 This Mumbai batsman scored 21
 00 kii ausat se 13 maichon main 273 ran banaae hai
 This includes just a fifties innings
 tippaniyan Binny was included in the team as a batsman all-rounder in the Test series in Sri Lanka
 kolkata kii slo trek ko dekhte hue binni ko mauka milane kii ummid jataai ja sakati he
 While Binny practiced batting with Suresh Raina during practice, he was seen sweating even in bowling
 vaise binni ne pichley dinon karnataka premier lig khelaa he
 Binny's performance in this league has been nothing special
 unhone 7 maichon main sirf 106 ran banaae or gendbaaji karte hue ek wicket liya
 If we talk about international team matches, Binny has 32 in 13 matches
 57 kii ausat se 228 ran banaae hai
 Captain MS Dhoni has been criticized for keeping Rahane out of the team due to Ambati Rayudu
 is baat ko dekhte hue shaayad captain ne apana vichaar badalte hue rahane ko mauka dene kaa man bana liya he
 Rayudu could not even open an account in both T20 matches played so far
 aise main unka team se baahar hona tay he
 Harbhajan Singh certainly tied the bridge to praise Rahane, but kept silence about playing
 harbhajan ne kaha, 'rahane ek achche khilaadi hai lekin unke khilne par aakhri faisla team management legaa
 ' sabhi maanate hai ki rahane tii20 ke maahir ballebaaj hai lekin ipel or antarrashtriya maichon ke unke aankade alag-alag tasviir dikhaate hai
 Rahane has scored 2195 runs in 81 matches of IPL but his performance in international T20 matches has been average
 mumbai ke is ballebaaj ne 21
 Has scored 273 runs in 13 matches at an average of 00
 isamen sirf ek ardhshtkeey pari shaamil he
 The comments binni ko srilanka main test series main ek ballebaaj ol-rounder ke taur par team main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Given the slow track of Kolkata, Binny can be expected to get a chance
 binni ne abhyaas ke dauraan suresh raina ke saath ballebaaji kaa abhyaas kiya to gendbaaji main bhi ve pasinaa bahaate najar aae
 By the way, Binny has played Karnataka Premier League in the past
 is lig main binni kaa pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa he
 He scored just 106 runs in 7 matches and took one wicket while bowling
 agar antarrashtriya team maichon kii baat karen to binni ne 13 maichon main 32
 Has scored 228 runs at an average of 57

 kalakatta hoicourt ne di thi jamaantphir saman jari karne kii taiyaarikendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne kolkata ke purv police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ko kalakatta hoicourt kii ore se agrim jamaanat die jane ke aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti dene kii taiyaari kar lee he
 In Rajiv Kumar Kosharda Chit Fund case, there was anticipatory bail
 sibiai se jude sutron ne ajtak ko bataaya ki hai court ke aadesh kaa adhyayan karne ke baad agency sheersh adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayegi
 The CBI has already expressed its intention to arrest IPS officer Rajiv Kumar
 agency rajeev kumaar ko agrim jamaanat milane ko asthai jhatka maan rahi he
 The source said that we want to interrogate Rajiv Kumar in custody
 hamaara saboot or dastavej pehle supreme court or kalakatta hai court kii ore se dekha ja chukaa he
 Earlier, the Calcutta High Court had rejected Rajiv Kumar's plea in which he had requested the central agency to exempt him from arrest
 hai court ne50 hajaar ke bond pardi thi jamaantarajiv kumaar ne nichali adaalat se jhatka milane ke baad agrim jamaanat ke liye hai court main yachika lagaai
 The High Court gave huge relief to Rajiv Kumar and granted anticipatory bail on a personal bond of Rs 50,000
 saath hi rajeev kumaar ko jaanch main sahyog dene kaa nirdesh bhi diya gaya
 There was no trace of Rajiv Kumar for the past two weeks
 kam se kam paanch baar saman kiye jane ke baavjood wo agency ke saamne pesh nahin hue
 CBI searched more than a dozen locations
 rajeev kumaar kii patni or staff se bhi unke pate thikaane ke bare main poochtacha kii gai, lekin agency unka pataa nahin laga saki
 CBN will then issue summons, another summon will be issued to Rajiv Kumar on behalf of CBICBI to appear before the agency
 saath hi agency kalakatta hai court ke aadesh ko chunauti dene ke liye ek hafte main supreme court ja sakati he
 According to the CBI, Rajiv Kumar has been involved in tampering of evidence, as well as accusing him of protecting some leaders from investigation in the Saradha and Rose Valley Chit Fund scams
 rajeev kumaar ko panshchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kaa vishwaasapaatr bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 China is also badly stung by the statement of Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in the United Nations General Assembly
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne sushamaa swaraj ko ahamkaari bataaya he
 However, he confessed that Pakistan is a refuge for terrorism
 darasal, shanivaar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko sambodhit karne ke dauraan sushamaa swaraj ne aatankwaad ko lekar pakistan par jamkar hamalaa bolaa tha
 At the same time, he also took a dig at China, who had put a hindrance in India's efforts to declare jaish-e-mohammed leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main videsh mantri swaraj ne bharat or pakistan kii uplabdhiyon kii bhi tulana kii
 He said that the two countries got independence together
 bharat iti kaa super power ban gaya, jabaki pakistan aatankwaad kaa panaahagaah
 At the same time, this dilemma of China has surfaced after Masood was surrounded on the international stage
 global times ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya ki pakistan main aatankwaad he, lekin kya aatankwaad kaa samarthan karnaa desh kii rashtriya niti he?ise bhi padhieh UN main sushamaa kaa sambodhan- ham garibi se lard rahe hai or hamaara padosi PAK hamsechini akhbaar ne kaha ki aakhir aatankwaad kaa niryaat karke pakistan ko kya phayda mil saktaa he? kya pakistan ko aatankwaad kaa niryaat karke paisa yaa sammaan mil saktaa he? global times ne doklam vivaad, van belt van road pariyojna or pakistan se apane rishte kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that his interest is hidden behind these arguments of India
 dragon ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat se ulajhane kaa uskaa koi iraadaa nahin hai
 It is also not good for China to have enmity

 Film Name: Ae Dil Hai mushkildirector: Karan joharstar Cast: Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Anushka Sharma, Fawad Khan Duration: 2 hours 37 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 2
 5 star'kuch kuch hota he', 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam', jaisi filmon ko diarect karne ke baad saal 2012 main karan johar ne 'student of da year' or 2013 main 'bombai tokies' film ke ek segment ko diarect kiya tha, ab karan ne ranbir kapur, aishwarya raay bachchan or anoushka sharma jaise actors ko lekar apni agali film diarect kii he jise 'i dil he mushkil' naam diya gaya he, aakhir kisi bani he ye film,aaie pataa karte hai
 The story of the film is about Ayan (ranbir Kapoor), who wants to become a singer in life but studies MBA due to fear of his father, where he meets Alijeh (anushka Sharma) and Ayan has an affair with Alijeh
 Although Alijeh gives it the name of friendship
 phir kahani aage badhati he or sabaataliar khan (aishwarya raay bachchan)kii entry hoti he
 There are many twists in the story and can Ayaan's unrequited love meet? You will have to watch the film to know this
 kyon dekhenfilm ke actorsranbir kapur, aishwarya raay bachchan, anoushka sharmaake diwane hai, to ye film aapako khud ba khud aakarshith karegi
 Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma have done a great job
 film main shahrukh khan, lija heden or aalia bhatta ke special apiyarence bhi hai or jaise hi shah rukh kaa cheharaa screen par aata he sarprise vaali taliyaan jarur bajati hai
 The film is a musical and visual treat, due to which a freshness remains throughout the film
 agar aapako sher o shaayari kaa shauk he to film ke dauraan aise kai maukey aate hai jab aap acchhee shaayari or van lainurs sun lete hai
 Weak episodes make the second half of the film seem quite big, due to so many ups and downs, these questions start running in the mind of where the film will end
 aishwarya raay bachchanaur shahrukh khan kii maujuudagi film kaa baj kriyet karne main phydemand tha lekin filmakan ke dauraan unhen or zyada cash kiya ja saktaa tha ,saath hi in donon kii entry bhi interval ke baad hi hoti he
 After a while, there are also questions in the mind that what do these characters ultimately want from each other? After the interval, there is a very complex story
 padhein: farji pradarshan, vasuuli ke dam par chalata mumbai kaa gunda'raaj'box offisfilm kii shooting landan paris austria ke saath- saath bharat main bhi kii gai he, prachaar prasar ke saath is film kaa bajet lagbhag 85 karod bataaya ja rahaa he, saath hi 2500 se zyada screens main'i dil he mushkil'relies bhi kii ja rahi he
 If the film does a business of 105 crores, then the money will be recovered, in the same way, after earning 115 crores, the film will be called a hit and after earning 155 crores the film will be called superhit
 vaise film ko dharma productions ne produs or fox star studios ne distribute kiya he, dekhte hai kaisaa hota he weekend

 Khaira Police Station President Daljit Jha said that when the family members were questioned, it was found that they did not have any idea that child marriage is a crime
 unhen to yah tak pataa nahin tha ki isamen sajaa kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 Daljit Jha said that if marriage had taken place, a case would have been registered
 lekin abhi shaadi nahin hui thi, isliye sabhi logon ko poochtacha kar va band paper par hastakshar karvaa kar chhod diya gaya

 In the four months from January to April 2018, 72 husbands lodged complaints with their wives against the police, while in second place, 52 husbands from the capital Bhopal have filed complaints against their wives
 isi avadhi main puure pradesh main 802 patiyon ne patni pratadna kii shikaayat darj karwaai he
 The official said that from January 2018, the Dial 100 team created a new category of 'beating husband event' along with other categories for callers on this number
 ab tak ye aankade gharelu hinsa kii vrihad shrenee main hi shaamil kiye jate the or inkaa alag se kahin ullekh nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Just like this, the general belief is that domestic violence only happens to women, while the second trend of the picture also came after becoming a category of beating husband event
 sharma ne bataaya ki dial 100 ne janvari se pradesh main beating hasband event or beating wif event kii shrenee ko gharelu hinsa kii shrenee se alag kar diya

 After this, women of Jabalpur, Gwalior and Chhindwara in the category have reported the highest number of complaints
 tippaniyan Arvind Chauhan, professor of social science at Barkatullah University, said that every form of domestic violence is condemnable in itself, but with changing times, there is a change in society
 sadiyon se apane astitv or adhikaron ke liye sangharsh kar rahi mahilaayein ab shiksha, prachaar madhyamon or kanoonee adhikaron kii jaankaree ke chalate pratirodh karne lagi hai
 Like incidents of assault with women in male dominated Indian society, incidents of assault on women along with men are condemnable

 Curiously, he has neither seen nor read Alan's stage productions
 phir bhi ve maanati hai ki unki khaas style kaa vyangy jivan bhar prabhavit karne vaala he
 After this, Alan's references are naturally spontaneous and coincidental
 kalki kahati hai, ‚Äúdarasal, jab kisi ne mujhe bataaya ki yah unhen alan kii yaad dilaataa he to maine faisla kar liya ki main iske baad unka naatak bilkul nahin padhuungi taaki mere upar kahin se bhi uskaa prabhaav na padane paae

 PM Narendra Modi has written a blog after returning from a 10-day tour of Myanmar, Australia and Fiji
 apane videsh daure par pehali baar modi ne pehali baar koi blog likhaa he
 In his long blog, the PM has told what was his success on his 10 day tour and why this tour was important for India
 piem ne apane blog main bataaya he ki har desh ke netaa ke saath unki kya-kya baat hui or bharat ko lekar is vakt duniya ke netaa kya sochate hai
 Dear friends, The evening of November 19 was a visit to Myanmar, Australia and Fiji
 main swadesh lautate hue raste main videsh yatra ke 10 dinon ke bare main soch rahaa tha ki bharat ne isse kya hasil kiya
 It was during this time that i thought that i should share my thoughts through the blog
 shuruyaat karne se pehle yah jaruri he ki is videsh yatra kaa aitihaasik mahatv samajha jaae
 As far as Australia is concerned, it was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in 28 years
 isi prakaar se fiji pahunchane main 33 saal lag gaye
 In this era of information revolution, people from all over the world are getting closer, but we could not reach these countries
 ye donon hi raashtra behad mahatvapurn hai
 i thought this situation should change
 
 
 maine kul paanch ahm baithkon main shirkat kii
 They also hosted one, which was held in Fiji
 maine kul 38 world leaders ke saath mulaakaat kii
 These include 20 bilateral talks
 main duniya ke har hisse se aane vaale netaaon ke saath mila
 All these meetings were very good
 kuch hamaare liye laabhakaari bhi raheen
 During this time i met many business leaders
 in sabhi baithkon ke dauraan maine gaur kiya ki duniya bharat kii ore behad sammaan or utsaah ke saath dekh rahi he
 The global community is very keen to connect with India
 hamane har netaa ke saath charchaa kii ki kaise rishton ko or vistaar diya ja saktaa he
 Strengthening trade-commerce and promoting industry in India were central to the negotiations
 jin netaaon se main mila, unamem bahut saare aise the, jo 'mek in india' ko lekar kaaphi utsuk dikhe or bharat aana chaahate hai
 i found it positive
 isse bharat main yuvaaon ko avasar milegaa or expoger bhi
 The leaders of some countries also showed interest in our plans for Next Generation Infrastructure and Smart Cities
 videsh yatra ke dauraan mujhe australia or fiji kii sansad ko sambodhit karne kaa bhi avasar praapt hua
 Being a representative of the world's largest democracy, visiting the temples of democracy and sharing ideas is a very pleasant experience
 loktantric deshon ke bich judaav ke liye isse behatar koi or tarika ho hi nahin saktaa
 One, through this, i got the opportunity to reach the leadership of these countries, the second opened new avenues of cooperation
 in deshon ke saansad mujhe bharat ko lekar behad ashaavadi lage
 The Parliament of Australia and Fiji was addressed for the first time by an Indian Prime Minister
 mujhe to yahaan tak bataaya gaya ki fiji kii sansad ko pehali baar kisi world leader ne sambodhit kiya, lekin main ise nijee sammaan ke rup main nahin dekhtaa
 This is a respect for 125 crore Indians
 ji-20 main bharat ne kaale dhan kaa mudda uthyaa
 i am glad that the global community paid attention to this, because this is an issue whose impact is not limited to any one nation
 aatankwaad, mani londring or narkotics trade main kaala dhan bade paimaane par istemaal hota he
 Since democratic forces are devoted to the 'rule of Law', it becomes our responsibility to fight together against it
 yah mudda uthaane ke liye ji-20 se behatar manch or kya ho saktaa tha
 During the ASEAN Conference, i got an opportunity to meet all the member states
 meraa maananaa he ki asian or bharat nae aayam bana sakate hai
 My conversation with Myanmar President Thein Sen focused on 3C - culture, commerce and connectivity
 pradhanmantri abot or main urja, culture, suraksha or parmaanu urja jaise muddon par bahut kam samay main tej gati se aage bade hai
 a 'make in India' roadshow will be organized next year to invite Australian companies to India
 australian kaarobaari bharat aane ke icchhuk hai
 In such a situation, the road show will be very effective
 main is videsh yatra ke dauraan anivaasee bharatiyon kii ore se mili pyaar or sammaan se abhibhoot hum
 When i announced the merger of OCI and pios in Australia and Fiji and Visa on Arrival, the faces of nris blossomed
 pravasi bharatiyon ko vikaas yatra main shaamil karnaa hamaara lakshya he or sarkaar iske prati puri tarah samarpit he

 Apart from this, issues related to documents also became a reason for delay
 sutron ne bataaya tha ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya

 haalanki unhen bhartiya khilaadiyon ke kamjor basics par shikawa jarur he

 ‚Äô unhone aage kaha, ‚Äòjamini str par vikaas or choti umr main pratibha ko nikhaarane par bahut adhik dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he

 This is not the first time a leader or chief minister has been troubled by journalism and wants to teach him a lesson
 kabhi jagannatha mishra ne yah koshish kii, kabhi rajeev gandhi ne yah koshish kii, or to or lalu yadav ne bhi ek daur main pili patrakarita kii shikaayat kii thi
 Now Arvind Kejriwal is making this complaint
 yah itihaas or purana he
 The British put him in jail
 us par jurmaana lagaaya, uski pratiyaan jabt kin
 Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency
 tab patrakarita saham gai, vah ghutanon ke bal chalane nahin, rengne lagi
 But Indira Gandhi could not save her power
 darasal sach kii sifat kuch aisi hoti he, or sach kehane kii deewangi kuch itani hoti he ki use dabaane kii sari koshishen bemaani ho jaati hai, takhto-taj ludhak jate hai
 Those who threaten the media forget that journalism grew up in prisons in India
 beshak, vah ujali parampara ab nahin bachi he
 Journalism is now a bargain, a compromise, blackmailing too
 lekin dilachasp ye he ki netaaon ko ye sauda bura nahin lagata, samjhaute nahin saalte, blakemeling tak bhi nahin khalati
 The comments patrakarita unhen tab khalati he jab vah sach bolti he
 When she does not come under the temptations of politics, when she does not raise the flag of fake movements, when she refuses to come under the guise of Kejriwal who calls herself a revolutionary
 aise main koi unhen jail main daalane kii baat karata he or koi apana akhbaar yaa channel nikaalane kii sochataa he
 But then he forgets that the leaders in this country also run newspapers and channels, the capitalists also did all the experiments
 lekin har peshey kii apni ek maryaada hoti he
 Journalism is also ultimately a business of truth
 jab vah jhooth kii ore mudati he to pakadi jaati he, jab vah khel karti he tab uskaa mazaaq banaaya jaataa he, lekin jab vah sach bolne nikal padati he to log usko salaam karte hai
 This is the mirror that shows us our face
 kejariwal yah aainaa todna chaahate hai, bhul jate hai ki is koshish main unka cheharaa bhi chur-chur hoga
 It is history and old
 angrejon ne use jail main daalaa
 He was fined, confiscated copies of it
 indira gandhi ne immergency lagaai
 Then the journalism stopped, she started crawling, not walking on her knees
 lekin indira gandhi apni satta nahin bachaa sakin
 Actually the truth is something like this, and the madness to tell the truth is so much that all the efforts to suppress it become meaningless, the throne and crown are rolled
 jo log media ko dhamkaate hai, ve bhul jate hai ki bharat main patrakarita jailkhanon main hi pali-badi
 Of course, that Ujjali tradition no longer survives
 patrakarita ab sauda bhi he, samjhauta bhi he, blakemeling bhi he
 But the interesting thing is that the leaders do not like this deal, the agreement is not negotiated, even the blackmailing does not stop
 tippaniyan Journalism kills her when she tells the truth
 jab vah raajnneeti ke pralobhanon main nahin aati, jab vah nakli andolanon kaa jhanda nahin uthaati, jab vah khud ko krantikari bataane vaale kejariwaalon ke jhaanse main aane se inkaar karti he
 In such a situation, someone talks about putting them in jail and someone thinks of taking out their newspaper or channel
 magar phir vah bhul jaataa he ki is desh main netaaon ne bhi akhbaar or channel chalaae, puunjishahon ne bhi sab prayog kiye
 But every profession has its own dignity
 patrakarita bhi antat: sach kaa hi kaarobaar he
 She is caught when she turns to a lie, she is made fun of when she plays, but when she comes out to tell the truth, people salute her
 yah vah aainaa he jo hamen hamaara cheharaa dikhaata he
 Kejriwal wants to break this mirror, forgetting that his face will also be broken in this effort

 The event 570 AD
 kii he, jab arab kii sarajameen par darindagi apni charam seemaa par thi
 Then God sent a messenger (prophet), who freed the Arab land from suffering and after introducing the formless God (allah), conveyed the message of God to the humans, who are the 'deen' of Allah
 ise islam kaa naam diya gaya
 'deen' did not come only for Muslims, it was for everyone, because in deen (islam) basically good actions have been guided and ways have been given to prevent and prevent bad works
 jab deen (islam) ko mohammad sahab ne failaana shuru kiya, tab arab ke lagbhag sabhi kabeelon ne mohammad kii baat maanakar allaah kaa deen kabool kar liya
 Seeing the number of tribes with Mohammad, Mohammed's enemies also came with Mohammad at that time (some in appearance and some out of fear)
 lekin ve mohammad se dushmani apane dilon main rakhe rahe
 Mohammed's eight June, 632 AD
 ko dehanth ke baad ye dushman dhire-dhire haaavee hone lage
 The first enemies attacked the house of Mohammed's daughter, Fatima Jahra, which broke the door of the house and fell on Fatima Jahra, and on August 28, 632 AD
 ko vah is duniya se chali gayi
 After many years, as soon as the opportunity came, the enemies, while reciting the Namaz (worship of God) in the mosque, killed the sword by killing the sword on the head of Mohammad's son-in-law Hazrat Ali
 uske baad dushmano ne mohammad ke bade naati imam hasan ko jehar dekar shahid kiya
 The enemies wanted to eliminate Mohammed's entire family, so after that, the enemy started pressuring Imam Hussain, Mohammed's younger grandson, that he would obey the command of Yazid (a Muslim by name only), the forcible Khalifa of that time
 Confess Khalifa to Yazid '
 yajid jo kahe use islam main shaamil karen or jo vah islam se hataane ko kahe vah islam se hataa den
 That is, replace the 'islam' created by Mohammad
 imam hossain par dabaav isliye tha, kyonki vah mohammad ke chahete naati the
 Regarding Imam Hussain, Mohammad said, 'hussain-o-minni wa ana minal Hussain' means Hussain and i am with Hussain, that is, he who hurt Hussain
 us samay kaa bana hua khalipha yajid chahta tha ki hossain uske saath ho jaaen, vah jaanata tha agar hossain uske saath aa gaye to sara islam uski mutthi main hoga
 Even after a lot of pressure, Hussain refused to accept any of his things, so Yazid planned to kill Hussain
 chaar may, 680 i
 Imam Hussein left his home in Medina and reached the town of Makke, where he intended to perform Haj, but came to know that the enemies could come and disguise the Hajis
 hossain ye nahin chaahate the ki kaaba jaise pavitra sthaan par khun bahe, phir hossain ne haj kaa iraadaa badal diya or shahar kufe kii ore chal die
 On the way, an army of enemies surrounded them and brought them to Karbala
 jab dushmano kii fouj ne hossain ko gheraa tha, us samay dushman kii fouj bahut pyaasi thi, imam ne dushman kii fouj ko pani pilwaaya
 Seeing this, 'hazrat Hurr', the chieftain of the enemy army, met Hussein with his family
 imam hossain ne karbala main jis jameen par apane kheme (tamboo) lagaae, us jameen ko pehle hossain ne kharida, phir us sthaan par apane kheme lagaae
 Yazid continued to pressurize Imam Hussain through his chiefs to accept Hussain, when Imam Hussain did not obey Yajid's conditions, the enemies finally put a guard of the army on the canal and prevented Hussain from entering the camps
 Has been applied teen din guzar jane ke baad jab imam ke parivaar ke bachche pyaas se tadapane lage to hossain ne yajidi fouj se pani maanga, dushman ne pani dene se inkaar kar diya, dushmano ne sochaa hossain pyaas se tut jaaenge or hamaari sari sharten maan lenge
 When Hussain did not listen to Yajid even after three days of thirst, the enemies started attacking Hussain's camps
 iske baad hossain ne dushmano se ek raat kaa samay maanga or us puri raat imam hossain or unke parivaar ne allaah kii ibaadat kii or dua maangate rahe, 'meraa parivaar, mere mitra chaahe shahid ho jaaen, lekin allaah kaa deen 'islam', jo naanaa (mohammad) lekar aae the, vah bachaa rahe
 '10 October, 680 AD

 By the way, there were only 75 or 80 men with Imam Hussain, including children from 6 months to 13 years
 islam kii buniyaad bachaane main karbala main 72 log shahid ho gaye, jinamein dushmano ne chah maheene ke bachche ali asagar ke gale par teen nok vaala tir maaraa, 13 saal ke bachche hazrat kasim ko jinda rahete ghodon kii taapon se rond dalwaaya or saat saal aath maheene ke bachche oun-mohammad ke sir par talwaar se waar kar use shahid kar diya
 After the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the enemies also burnt the camp of Imam and took the women and sick men and children of the family hostage
 jo log ajadaari (moharram) manaate hai, vah imam hossain kii qurbaaniyon ko hi yaad karte hai

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi expressed displeasure over Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid calling Narendra Modi 'impotent' and said that i do not like this kind of language at all
 kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ne buudhvaar ko apane bayaan kaa bachaav karne kii koshish kii thi or kaha tha ki meraa arth 'naakaabil' se tha, lekin vah is sandarbh main kaaphi halkaa shabd tha
 
 
 i am not a doctor to comment on his (narendra Modi) physical abilities
 
 
 raajnneeti main 'napunsak' shabd kaa istemaal 'naakaabil' logon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 
 
 It was about 'nakabiliyat', but it would have been a much lighter word in this context
 
 
 " Significantly, this new comment of the foreign minister against bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was made by questioning the manner in which the Chief Minister dealt with the riots after the Godhra incident of 2002
 khurshid ne pehle ek baar modi kii tulana medhak se kii thi, jo abhi-abhi kuen se baahar niklaa he
 Without naming Modi, MP from Farukhabad Khurshid questioned why a person aspiring for the post of Prime Minister of the country could not do anything during the 2002 riots
 kuch log aate hai, hamalaa karte hai or chale jate hai or aap raksha nahin kar sakate
 You are not a strong person? He said, we do not call you (modi) accused of killing people
 
 
 hamaara aarope he ki tum napunsak ho
 You could not stop the killers
 madhyapradesh main misa bandiyon kii pension ko kamalnath sarkaar pradesh ne philhal asthai taur par band kar diya he
 The government is saying that those who get pension will be resumed after the investigation
 haalanki is jaanch main kitna vakt lagegaa yah abhi saaf nahin he
 The General Administration Department, while putting a temporary moratorium on pension, attributed this to physical verification of pensioners and making the process of pension distribution more transparent
 iske liye sieji kii report ko aadhaar banaaya gaya
 In Madhya Pradesh, more than 2000 MISABANDI are currently taking a monthly pension of 25 thousand rupees
 saal 2008 main shivaraj sarkaar ne misa bandiyon ko 3000 or 6000 pension dene kaa praavdhaan kiya
 Later the pension amount was increased to Rs 10,000
 saal 2017 main misa bandiyon kii pension raashi badhaakar 25000 rupee kii gai
 It costs about 75 crores annually
 bijepi kah rahi he ki vah katautee sahan nahin karegi
 The Congress believes that the BJP looted the government treasury on its own
 purv mantri vishwaas saarang ne kaha misabandi loktantr kii raksha karne vaale prahari the jinhone loktantr kii raksha ke liye tyaag kiya
 If the government takes such action, it will be completely retaliatory action which will not be tolerated
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki bijepi ne 25000 rupee pratimah pension ke naam par misabandi ke logon ko paisa baanta he
 Freedom fighters were not getting pension
 
 But gave pension to Misabandis
 rajya main purv mukhyamantri babulal gaur, shivaraj singh chouhan, thavarchand gahalot, purv kendriya mantri sartaaj singh jaise logon ko bhi misa bandi ke tahat pension milti he

 In Chandauli, eastern Uttar Pradesh, the forest department team has rescued a rare species of chinkara
 van vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii maane to aawaara kutton ke hamale se dar kar chinkaara gramin ilaake main aa gaya tha
 At present, this chinkara has been released in the Chandraprabha Sanctuary under Kashi Wildlife Division after rescuing it
 darasal chandauli ke junglee ilaake naugarh or is ilaake se guzarane vaali karmnasha nadi ke kachaar main chinkaara prajati ke hiran bahutayat main paae jate hai
 This chinkara deer also wandered from this area and came to the Chahaniya area of chandauli district
 isaki soochna 2 din pehle van vibhaag kii team ko graminon se mili thi
 The villagers had told the forest workers that a buck has been seen in the fields around the village of Meharkha in Chahaniya block
 iske baad van vibhaag kii team chahania range ke ranger khaliq ahamed ke netritv main is hiran kii talash main jute gai
 After 2 days of tireless hard work, it was found out that it is a rare deer species
 iske baad gheraabandi karke van vibhaag kii team ne ise pakadaa or ise chandraprabha abhayaarany main chhod diya gaya
 This chinkara species deer is considered a rare species in wildlife and is placed in schedule-1 of wildlife
 isaki khaasiyat he ki yah kaaphi tej gati se daudta he or isaki speed 120 se 150 kilometre prati ghanta ho sakati he
 Its hooves are very sharp, due to which it is adept at holding ground, but during rainy days, this special feature sometimes becomes an enemy of its life
 barsaat ke dinon main jameen geeli hone kii vajah se yah hiran tej nahin daud paata kyonki nukile khur hone kii vajah se iske pair jameen main dhansane lagate hai
 In such a situation, when stray dogs get sight of this buck, they want to hunt it
 yah hiran apni jaan bachaakar bhaagta he lekin jameen geeli hone kii vajah se tej gati se daud nahin paata or aksar isi vajah se yah kutton kaa shikaar ban jaataa he
 This chinkara got lucky this time and escaped from the stray dogs and came towards the village
 is bare main van vibhaag ke chaniya range ke ranger khaliq ahamed ne bataaya ki yah ek durlabh prajati kaa chinkaara hiran he jo kutton ke hamale ke dar se bhagkar gramin ilaake main aa gaya tha
