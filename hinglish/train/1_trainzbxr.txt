 Gadar's director Anil Sharma does not consider the earnings of the film 'baahubali 2' to cross 1500 crores continuously at the box office
 anil sharma kaa kahana he ki aaj aankadon ke hisaab se dekha jaae to unki film gadar ne 5000 karod kaa aankada paar kiya tha
 Regarding the film Baahubali, which is breaking new records every day at the box office, Anil Sharma says that this is a matter of time
 unki film 'gadar ek prem katha' saal 2001 main ai thi or us samay film ne 265 karod kii kamai kii thi
 If we look at it today, this figure is 5000 crores

 If a good film comes, the records will be broken

 He further said that as i mentioned earlier that Gadar had earned 265 crores in 2001, at that time the ticket used to be only 25 rupees
 agar aaj ke samay se isaki tulana kii jaae to ye 5000 karod rupee hota he or bahubali 2 ne sirf 1500 karod hi kamaaye hai
 Bahubali-2 became the most profitable film, know how much profit was made for Karan Johar, Anil Sharma's son Utkarsh played the role of 'gadar' Sunny and Amisha's child
 ab vah 'jeniyas' film se debyue karne ja rahe hai

 This clarification has come at a time when the voice against the sanction given to GM mustard is getting louder and Swadeshi Jagran Manch associated with the Sangh Parivar has written a letter to the Prime Minister requesting that the government should not approve the approval of GEAC because GM mustard Is toxic and will not increase yields

 '' Prior to GM mustard, India's organization has questioned the Bt brinjal
 beati coton ke anubhav par bhi bahes chal rahi he
 Many organizations associated with the Sangh Parivar are also opposed to GM mustard

 In Delhi, a woman got burnt due to high tension wires
 us samay mahila chat se apane bachche kii gandi dyper phenk rahi thi
 Suddenly the wires near the house pulled him towards him
 mahila ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan uski haalat gambhir bani hui he
 According to the information, this case is of Bindapur area
 mritak mahila annu apane bete ke saath himachal pradesh se dilli mamaa ke ghar ai thi
 At 11 o'clock last night Annu went to the terrace to dry his clothes
 usee samay peedita ne bachche kii gandi dyper ko ghar ke peeche phenkane lagi
 Suddenly the high-tension wires passing over pulled him
 iske baad annu ko tej bijli kaa jhatka laga
 She fell back on the roof
 uski chillane kii aawaaj sunakar ghar ke log chat par pahunche
 By that time the victim was quite scorched
 fouran use aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan se use safadarajang aspataal refer kiya gaya
 He is undergoing treatment in the hospital

 Before Unmukt Chand's unbeaten 111-run innings, the Under 19 World Cup cricket final match had only two centuries to date
 wasim akram ke mutabik unmukt kaa shatak aaj tak unka dekha junior cricket kaa sabase behtareen shatak tha
 Brett Williams (australia) and Stephen Peters (england), who scored centuries before, are not known to any average cricket lover
 ab 34 baras ke ho chuke peters ne pratham shrenee ke cricket main 12,000 se zyada ran batore, lekin kabhi england ko jeet nahin dilava sake jabaki williams ne cricket chhodie se pehle sirf chaar pratham shrenee ke cricket match khele
 Four years ago, after India's victory in Malaysia in the Under-19s, Virat Kohli, who was the captain of the team, said, "I had said the most to go there and play as if it was the last game of our lives
" ” aaj kohli 87 pariyon main 13 ekadivasiy shatak ke saath cricket ke akaash par sitare kii tarah chamak rahe hai
 He made his first Test century in Adelaide against Australia in January
 yah baat alag he ki unki team ke baaki saathiyon ke liye kualalampur kaa vah din iklauta yaadgaar din ho saktaa he kyonki kohli yaa yuvaraj singh (2000 main vijeta bhartiya team ke main of da toornament) ke alaava darjanon aise khilaadi hai, jinke liye junior cricket kaa vishwa cap final hi unki jindagi kaa sabase ahm kshan he
 Ravneet Rikki, for example, was the top-ranked batsman in the U-19 batting order in 2000, but the last time he played Ranji was in 2008
 isi saal 14 wicket lene vaale shalab shrivastav ko ek gharelu match main phixing kaa aaropee paae jane par paanch saal ke liye pratibandhit kar diya gaya tha
 In an event organized to honor the 2008 winners, Rahul Dravid told how difficult it is to get from junior to the main team, i would like to remind you that only one member of the team that won the Under-19 World Cup in 2000 ( Yuvraj Singh) today is part of the Indian team in Brisbane (which won the CB Series of three countries)
 yah aapke liye sochane vaali baat he
 i played for the Under-19s in 1991 and i was the only person in my team who went on and played for India
 yah aap sabaki jindagi main ek nirnaayak charan kii shuruyaat he
 What you do after here will matter
 ”aaj jab bhartiya cricket main bade paimaane par nae chehron kaa aana ho rahaa he, koi aashcharya nahin ki under-19 vishwa cap ke nayakon ko lekar logon main itnaa utsaah he
 But except Unmukt, the rest are not even guaranteed to play Ranji on behalf of their state
 bhale hi is fatah se ve surkhiyon main aa gaye hon, lekin asli khel to aage he
 Virat Kohli's two other teammates Ravinder Jadeja and Saurabh Tiwari also won India in the Under-19s
 haalanki in donon main se koi bhi bhartiya team kaa niyamit hissaa nahin ban sakaa he
 Manish Pandey, the first Indian to score a century in IPL, still has a long way to go to reach the team
 team kii jarurat ke hisaab se lambii pari khilne ko apni aadat bana chuke unmukt chand ke paas bhartiya team main pravesh paane ke liye lambii chalaang lagane kii maansik takat or kshamta maujuud he
 Baba Aparajith, who lifted the team from a dangerous position of 8 for 3 against Pakistan in the quarter-finals, has also got his iron back, while Harmeet Singh has kept the balance and control under tremendous pressure to take the team to the threshold of victory
 Demonstrated patience
 apni marji ke mutabik yorker maarane vaale or gend ko jaadugar kii tarah ghumaane vaale sandip sharma tathaa balle or gend donon se kaushal dikhaane vaale kamaal passi ne bhi logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 But as Dravid said, what they do after here will matter more and decide whether they will be the next Kohli or Yuvraj or will be lost in a crowd of unknown names

 bachapan main hui apni shaadi ko apnaane se inkaar karne vaali jodhpur kii yuvati kii kahani ab sibiesai kii kitaab main padhane ko milegi
 CBSE has included the story of the girl in the book 'human Rights and Gender Studies' in class 11th and 12th from this session
 human ritis and gender studies ko isi satr se nae vishay ke rup main jagah di ja rahi he
 20 years ago, when Lakshmi of Luni village in Jodhpur district was just 1 year old, she was married to 3-year-old Rakesh of Sutlana village
 jab lakshmi kii umr 16 saal hui to use apni is shaadi ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Since then, she has been continuously refusing to consider herself married
 is dauraan use apane sasuraal paksh ke logon or pati rakesh kii kuch buree baton or aadaton ke bare main bhi pataa chalaa
 Due to this, Lakshmi decided to oppose her cowherd and her brother Hanuman also supported her in this decision
 akshay tritiya ke maukey par lakshmi kaa gauna hona tha, jiske baad use apane sasuraal main hi rahanaa tha, lekin usne iskaa virodh karne kaa man bana liya
 Meanwhile, Lakshmi and her brother saw an interview of Sarathi Trust managing trustee and rehabilitation psychologist Kirti Bharti against child marriage on a local channel
 bhai-bahan ne kirti se sahaayta maangi
 Lakshmi told that she was not happy with this marriage in childhood and she also told her parents about this, but they did not agree
 iske baad usne bharti se sahaayta maangi
 Bharti told 'aaj Tak' aide newspaper 'mail Today' that at first her intention was to somehow prevent her from being counseled or legally 'gowna', but Lakshmi feared that her father-in-law would again go to Gowana a few months later
 Will insist on doing and he will have to go to their house forever
 lakshmi ke is dar ko dekhte hue hi bharti ne uski samasya ke sthaayee hal ke bare main sochaa
 After this, the marriage of the two was legally canceled with the consent of Lakshmi's husband Rakesh in the presence of a public notary in Jodhpur on 24 April 2012
 bharti ke anusaar bachapan main hui shaadi kii radd karne kaa yah pehla maamla he
 Though Rakesh initially wanted to keep the marriage going, he relented after counseling
 lakshmi kii kahani ko kitaab main duusare adhyay ke rup main ‘gender related ishyus’ main jagah di gai he
 The chapter has been named 'indian Teenager Annals Every Child Marriage', which is on page number 207 in the 11th grade book
 haalanki is adhyay main yah nahin bataaya gaya he ki badi hone ke baad lakshmi ne apni pasand ke vyakti se 31 janvari 2013 ko shaadi kar lee he
 Her husband's name is Mahendra

 film kaa naam:koun kitne pani mendyrector:nila maadhab pandasster cast:kunal kapur, radhika apte, saurabh shukla, gulshan groveevadhi:113 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:1
 5 Starrahim ji has a couplet, 'rahiman pani ashhiye, bin pani sub sunin', that is, the presence of water is very important
 2011 main ek film relies hoti he 'oy em kalam', jise kaaphi saraahaa jaataa he, phir saal 2012 main 'jalapari' or 2014 main 'bablu happy he' jisko darshakon ne bilkul nahin saraahaa
 Now the director of these films Neela Madhab Panda has made a film based on the problem of water named 'kaun Kiya Pani Mein', now will this film make the director's thinking public? Let's know how this film is: Kahaani
 This is a story of two villages which are divided on the basis of caste, in the upper part Vraj Singh Dev (saurabh Shukla), a descendant of the ancestral king, lives with his people and in the Kheri wrestler in Barry part
 (gulshan Grover) lives with his people and daughter Jahnavi (radhika Apte)
 vruj singh dev kaa betaa raaj singh dev (kunal kapur) jab padhai likhaai karke apane gaanv aata he to dekhtaa he kii har taraf pani kii samasya he or apane pita ke saath milakar kuch aisa swang rachataa he kii bairi bhaag se pani milane lage
 Eventually the people of both the villages agree on one conclusion and the happy ending
 script, abhinay, sangitafilm kaa mudda to kaaphi gahan he lekin script or screenple main kaaphi feekaa sa ho jaataa he
 While there is a king on one side but he also does not have water, the entire film shows water more than money, like by marrying water, marry and cohabit by giving water and the priest blesses you in this village
 nila ne film kaa khaakaa to kaaphi acha banaaya he lekin vyangy dikhaane kaa dhang kaaphi kamjor he
 One of the dialogues of the film was quite special that 'thirsty has no caste, thirsty is just thirsty
 'raja kii sampatti nahin bik rahi kyonki gaanv main pani nahin he, raja kaa betaa dushman gaanv main jaakar kaam karne lagata he
 In today's twenty-first century, the way of showing this film could have been even better because the issue of water is very serious and the attempt to show it as satire seems a failure
 abhinay kii agar baat karen to saurabh shukla, gulshan grover or radhika apte ne umdaa kaam kiya he or shaayad kai dinon ke baad silver screen par aane kii vajah se kunal kii acting kii dhar kam ho gai he
 Looking at Kunal, you are unable to agree with his character
 film main orisa kaa loakgeet 'rangabatti' to kaaphi acha he lekin ek lav sang bhi he jo ki film kii raftaar ko kaaphi kamjor karata he
 Why see if you are a fan of Kunal Kapoor, Radhika Apte, Saurabh Shukla or Gulshan Grover, then watch this film
 kyon naa dekhenmehanat kii kamai ko pani kii tarah naa bahaaen, weekend par or koi opshan kii talash karen

 To find out the truth of the viral post, when we reverse-searched the picture, we found a news article confirming the incident on the local news website
 yah pul jamnagar-junagarh rod par sathudad gaanv ke paas, jamakandorna taluka se kareeb 14 kilometre kii duuri par sthit tha
 On the afternoon of June 19, the bridge suddenly collapsed
 haalanki iskaa udghaatan teen maheene pehle pradhanmantri modi ne nahin kiya tha
 Sub-divisional magistrate of Dhoraji, GK Meyani said that this culvert was more than 50 years old
 vahiin kshetra ke agxcutive ejeeniyar (maarg-makaan karypalak) jevi joshi ne bhi bataaya ki yah puliya 50 saal se bhi adhik samay pehle bani thi
 Looking at the picture carefully, it can be said that the pillars of this culvert were made of big stones, whereas nowadays such bridge is constructed with concrete etc
 ‘ajtak’ se baat karte hue sathudad gaanv ke sarpanch jitendra singh jadeja ne bataaya, ‘yah pul 50 saal se bhi zyada purana tha or khandhar haalat main tha
 We had several times asked the administration to get it repaired, but no action was taken on it
 puliya ke upar sadak kareeb dedh saal pehle durust kii gai thi
 'jadeja also told that' PM Modi never inaugurated this bridge
 ’hamane bhi is udghaatan sambandhi khabar talashne kii koshish kii, lekin internet par hamen is tarah kii koi khabar nahin mili
 The last time PM Modi inaugurated the four-lane bridge over the Narmada River in Gujarat in March 2017
 is udghaatan kii khabar kareeb kareeb harmedia housene cover kii thi
 It became clear in the investigation that the claim being viral is misleading
 jamnagar-junagarh puliya tuutane kii khabar sahi he, lekin is puliya kaa teen maheene pehle piem modi ne udghaatan nahin kiya tha

 Experts believe that this meeting may prove to be inconclusive
 kyonki ek taraf saudi apane rukh par ada hua he
 At the same time, Iran is also strengthening its position not to increase production

 vaise to ladakiyon kii adaaon par lattu hona ladakon kii fitrat hi hoti he
 Nevertheless, it is not very easy to impress boys
 ladakiyon ko yah jarur pataa hona chahie ki ve jise dilojaan se chaahati hai or jiske saath rishta aage le janaa chaahati hai, uske saath date par kis tarah pesh aayaa jaae
 Actually, it is very difficult to read the mind of a person
 agar koi ladkaa kisi friend ko zyada ahmiyat de, to iskaa yah matlab katai nahin he ki vah usase tikaoo rishte main hi bandhana chahta he
 Boys can accept anyone for a short time, but trouble may arise at some point in the future
 yahi vajah he ki ladakon par apana bharpoor asar daalane ke liye kuch baton kaa khyal rakhana jaruri he
 Here are some tips: 1
 ladke ke saath date par jane se pehle apni dress kaa khaas khyal rakhen
 The dress should be such that you look completely decent
 ise acchhee tarah samaj len ki dress ekadam nai yaa mahangi hona katai jaruri nahin he
 The dress modern will work, but it should not reflect any kind of clumsyness
 2
 Whatever you say, speak thoughtfully
 jitna pehle se soch-samajhakar gai hai, use mauka milte hi fatafat kahana na shuru kar den
 Even in less words, your words can be said in a more effective way
 aisa na ho ki pehle bina vichaare kuch bhi kah diya jaae, phir us par ghanton baithkar afsos kiya jaae
 3
 aam taur par ladakon ko aisa lagata he ki ladkiyaan baat-bebaat, baaten bahut zyada karti hai
 Girls should not be seen to 'seal' their image on this image at least in the initial stages
 saath hi ladke se zyada se zyada sawaal dagkar unhen jhunjhalane par majaboor na karen
 4
 ladakiyon kaa adaa ke saath sharmaana to ladakon ko khub bhaataa he, par isamen balance bahut jaruri he
 Do not be so shy that something important remains untold, but do not even open so much that your image becomes 'different'
 5
 Try to look just like you are
 impresson daalane ke chakkar main banaavati labaadaa odhane se bachein
 The foundation of a long-lasting relationship can only stay on the ground of truth
 6
 Avoid excessive use of perfumes
 halki khushboo vaale parafum kaa istemaal bhi behad kam maatra main karnaa hi thik rahata he
 7
 ladakon ko kabhi bhi paise ke chashme se dekhne kii koshish na karen
 Emotional boys would like someone to measure their relationship on the scale of wealth

 The Congress' land acquisition law was not in favor of industries but it came out of a long political consensus that included all parties including BJP, whose governments are in different states
 jameen antat rajyon kaa vishay he isliye rajyon ne nae kanoon ke tahat apane tareeke se kisaanon ko sahamat karne va rajya ke kanoon main badlaav ke jariye udyogon kii chintaaon ko jagah dene kii kavayad shuru kar di thi
 The Uttar Pradesh government took about 30,000 hectares of land from farmers in two years
 yah ekamusth adhigrahan nahin tha balki prayek bhuswami se jiladhikariyon ne sidhe baat kii or unhen nae kanoon ke tahat muaavja dekar jameen kii registry sarkaar ke naam karai
 If the figure of the Uttar Pradesh government is correct, then about 28,000 such registries have been done
 bade bhoomi adhigrahanon main prabhaviton par saamaajik-aarthik asar ke akalan or 80 fisadi bhuswamiyon kii sahmati kii shart buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon main deree kii vajah ban sakati he
 Rajasthan proposed to increase the compensation amount to the farmers in the state's Land Acquisition Act to find a solution
 kuch suzav rajya vidhansabha select cameti ne die jisase kanoon kamobesh santulit ho gaya
 The states of the west and south facilitated land acquisition through land pooling
 is prakriya main jameen ke chote-chote hisson ko kisaanon se jutakar sarkaar bada package banaati he or vahaan buniyadi dhaancha viksit karne ke baad usase vikaas kii laagat nikaal kar jameen waapas bhuswamiyon ko de di jaati he jisase bhoomi kii keemat bad jaati he or vikritaon ko nijee developers se achche daam milte hai
 The Andhra Pradesh government has raised 30,000 acres of land from farmers in just three months through land pooling to make Vijayawada its new capital
 chhattisgarh sarkaar ne nayaa raipur basaane ke liye land pooling kaa thik usee tarah safal prayog kiya jaisaa ki gujarat main hua
 After the storm of politics on the ground, Andhra Pradesh will now find it difficult to raise 15,000 acres for Vizag Airport and land pooling in the capital Delhi will also not be comfortable
 jameen samvedansheel he
 State governments can handle its acquisition more practically
 behatar hota ki udyog kii jaruraton ke hisaab se rajya apane kanoonon ko badalte jaisaa ki uttar pradesh or rajasthan main hua yaa phir land pooling jaisi koshishen karte jo pashchim or dakshin ke rajyon ne kin
 But the Modi government has overconfined itself in the complex politics of the land and has also weakened the efforts of the states
 ek sajag sarkaar ko gramin arthvyavstha kii taaja surat dekhte hue khetihar jameen par thahar kar baduya chahie tha
 The new government stopped increasing support prices as soon as they arrived
 isse mahangaai to nahin ghati lekin kheti se aay jarur kam ho gai
 Monsoon was worse than average
 duniya main krishi utpaadon kii keemten ghatin jisase niryaat bhi kam hua
 The rate of increase in wages in rural areas has now come down
 is bich 2014 main kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke maamalon main 26 fisadi ke ijaphe se kheti ko lekar badi chintaaon kii roshni main, bhoomi adhigrahan ko udaar karne ke liye rajnatik jameen katai sakt ho chuki he
 For the first time in ten years, the rise in land prices in villages has stopped
 sone kii keemton main narmi bhi gramin maang kam hone kii vajah se he
 The market for two-wheelers, consumer products, gensets, cement and building materials in India is largely dependent on the rural economy
 in utpaadon kii companiyon ke aankade bikri or aay main badi giravat dikhaa rahe hai
 The concern of the companies is that the light of growth has not yet shone in the urban and industrial economy
 bhoomi adhigrahan ke baad agar gaanvon main rajnatik maahaul bigadaa to rahi sahi maang or chuk jaaegi
 This was not the right time to behead the land acquisition
 aarthik growth va rojgaar waapas lautne ke baad is taraf mudtha behatar hota jabaki bijepi ke netaa bhunbhuna rahe hai ki party ne chunaav ke dauraan bhoomi adhigrahan par munh tak nahin kholaa or satta main aane ke baad, ab unhen aag kaa yah gola kisaanon ke gale utaarne kii jimmedaari di ja rahi he
 After examining the political and economic temperature for land acquisition, it hurts the perception that leaders always read the pulse of the public correctly
 baat keval itani nahin he ki bhoomi adhigrahan par adhyadesh kii jaldbaaji ne hataash or bikhare vipaksh ko ekajute hone kaa mauka de diya he balki is kanoon par gatirodh se desh ke maahaul main upja feel good khatm ho rahaa he
 Even if the change in land acquisition is passed from Parliament with stubbornness, the atmosphere will not be better
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan pradhanmantri ne congress par tanj ksaa tha ki mujhe raajnneeti acchhee tarah se aati he, lekin bhoomi adhigrahan par badali siyasat to kuch or hi ishaara kar rahi he
 Probably the greatest joy in a person's life is being a father
 lekin sochie jab aapako yah khushi mili to aap uskaa gavaah banane ke liye vahaan par maujuud naa ho
 Yes, something similar has happened with Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja

 When Modi sat in the power chair in this oath, he had a light yellow kurta on his body
 donon baaju batandaar aasteenon main chhipe hue the
 He was wearing a golden colored Nehru jacket
 bina frem kaa vahi chir-parichit chashma or safed baalo vaale sir ke neeche khulaa maathaa or gambhir ankhen
 There was a sense of responsibility more than euphoria in a calm looking face
 modi khush kam, nirnaayak zyaada nazar aa rahe the
 Modi, like a controlled and disciplined MP, took the oath of office and secrecy as the Prime Minister, beyond the taunts and sporadic conversations of other mps around him
 ye modi dilli ke liye nae the
 Delhi was new to him

 It was anticipated that the victory celebration would be bigger this time
 aisa hua bhi
 The largest and grand oath-taking ceremony in the history of independent India was held in the premises of Rashtrapati Bhavan

 Sinha clarified that, 'DRI (directorate of Revenue Intelligence) did a survey of these vehicles, but they could not work properly, that's why we decided to proceed strictly in the case of duty evasion
 ’ car ke maalik ko car jimme namaa ke aadhaar par car waapas karne kaa matlab yah he ki vaahan kii pahchaan kar lee gai he or jab bhi kanoonee maamle main car kii jarurat hogi use prastut kiya jayega

 sinha ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko sibiai kii karrwai ko raajnneetik sajeesh qaraar diya gaya, lekin yah chhapemari sibiai kii drushti se bilkul thik thi or ham apana kaam kar rahe the
 We had reasonable doubt that Karunanidhi's grandson had one such car, and we were looking for the same car

 BJP has emerged as the largest party in Karnataka although the party is a few seats behind when it touches the magic figure of majority
 rajya main chunaav ke nateezon ke dekhen to trishanku vidhansabha he
 In such a situation, both jds-congress and BJP are trying to form a government
 karnataka main 222 siton main se bijepi ko 104 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 In this way, it will need at least 7 seats to form the government
 congress 78 to jedies 38 siton par aage he
 The other 2 seats are leading
 raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to manipur, goa or meghalaya kii tarah yadi congress bahumat se kuch seat bhi dur rahi to bhaajapa karnataka main bhi sarkaar bana legi
 Prior to this, the BJP managed to form its government despite not reaching the majority figure in many state elections
 goa main 40 siton par vidhansabha chunaav hua tha
 21 seats were necessary for a majority
 congress ne 17 siten jiti thim
 Whereas BJP had won 13 seats
 bhaajapa ne emjeepi or anya dalon ke saath rajya main sarkaar bana lee
 Similarly, 31 seats were needed for a majority in Manipur
 congress ne 28 or bijepi ne 21 siten jeetin thim
 But the BJP formed the government along with other parties, including the NPP
 sabase bada jhatka congress ko bijepi ne meghalaya chunaav main diya tha
 Here Congress won 20 seats, while BJP won only 2 seats
 iske baavjood enpipi ke netritv main 6 dalon ke saath bijepi ne sarkaar bana lee
 If the BJP has not got a clear majority in the Karnataka assembly election results, then its path will not be so easy
 bijepi ko karnataka kii satta se baahar rakhane ke liye congress-jedies ne sanyukt rup se sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he

 magar raajnneeti main jaraa bhi dilchaspee rakhane waalon ke liye immergency ek behad jaruri paath he
 It is important to remember this for those who value democracy and also for those who gain strength from democracy
 25 june 1975 kaa din, jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne aantarik updraviyon kaa hawala dete hue desh main apatkaal lagu kiya tha
 With this, all the opposing leaders, including Jayaprakash Narayan, were put in jail
 sansad kaa kaarykaal paanch baras se badhaakar chah baras kaa kar diya gaya tha
 All fundamental rights were revoked
 court ke par katar die gaye
 The press was silenced through censorship
 in sabake saath hi indira kii sarkaar or unke chote shahjade or raajnneetik vaaris sanjay gandhi kii manamanion kaa silsilaa bhi chal niklaa
 On paper, it was called a five-point program
 sanjay gandhi apane naanaa pandit nehru ke samaajwaad or mummy kii kathith garib samarthak nitiyon se katai prabhavit nahin the
 He was a devotee of the Capitalist system
 or saath main betarah adheer bhi
 He got unlimited power without doing anything
 bina kisi javabdehi ke
 And they took advantage of it brutally
 magar immergency sirf indira or sanjay ke karnaamon kaa chittha hi nahin he
 Many people had gathered around these two to lick the rubbing of power
 ye unki bhi kahani he
 And more than this, it is the story of those anti-leaders, activists and common people who have suffered the brunt of this autocracy
 immergency par desh main kai kitaaben, lekh or sansmaran likhe gaye
 These were broadly of two types
 ek, jinhone ise bhoga
 He wrote his point of view
 masalan, indian express kii samachar agency ke us samay sampadak rahe kuldeep naiyar kii kitaab, immergency retold
 Or historians wrote it as a chapter in Indian politics
 iske liye tamaam first hand acount, akhabaari report or immergency kii jaanch ke liye janata sarkaar dwaara banaae gaye shah kamishan kii report ko aadhaar mana gaya
 In the first there was a lot of subjectivity and in the second there was a lot of interactivity
 donon kaa hi apana mahatv he
 But now a book has arrived, which brilliantly balances the two
 is kitaab kaa naam he da immergency- e personal history
 The book has been written by Consulting Editor of Indian Express Kumi Kapoor
 kumi immergency ke vakt indian express akhbaar ke saath bataur reporter judi thim
 Her husband Virender Kapoor was with the Financial Express
 virender kaa ek roj sanjay gandhi kii khaas yuva netaa ambika soni se jhagada ho gaya
 As a result, Virender Kapoor was also jailed under the sections of the DIR
 yahaan se kumi kaa doharaa sangharsh shuru hua
 To make all the news of Emergency as a reporter
 apni kuch maheenon kii bacchee ko paalna
 And lobbying and running around for Virender
 yah to hui personal baat
 But for the book, Kumi did long interviews of all the important people of that period
 har uplabdh likhit shabd ko khangala
 There should be a three-volume report of the Shah Commission or the newspapers of that period
 baad ke dashakon main likhi gai kitaaben hon yaa phir samay samay par hone vaale khulaase
 And all these together presented a complete picture of the Emergency, before and after it
 kitaab bahut hi rochak he
 Its language is simple
 isamen kisson kii bharmaar he
 But beneath their surface, many important lessons of politics appear to be fidgeting
 355 pannon ko padhane ke dauraan kahin bhi boriyat nahin hoti
 Due to short chapters, reading is easy
 maruti kii kahani ho yaa bansilaal kii chatukaarita, lalit narayan mishra kaa karpshan or maut ho yaa jagmohan kaa bulldozer
 Be it Rukhsana Sultan's sterilization campaign, or with the government of Jordan Fernandes and Subramanian Swamy
 sabamein ek dharawahik si nirantarata, romaanch or gaharaai he
 It is important to know the death of actress Snehlata Reddy to remember the cruelty of that era
 jaiprakash narayan kii pidaa ko samajhnaa jaruri he
 Overall, this is a very important book
 ummid he ki jald hi ise hindi main bhi relies kiya jayega
 Those interested in political anecdotes and their results, and of course the youth, must read this book

 Assembly elections are going to be held in some states including Maharashtra
 ab chunaav se pehle bahut kuch vaade kiye jaaenge
 There will be talk about the problem of farmers
 kisaanon ke liye kai yojanaon kii ghoshnaa hogi
 After the election all these promises will prove to be hollow because if the political parties had fulfilled their promise then the farmer would not have committed suicide today
 bank se lone nahin letaa
 If the farmers had got the right price for their crops, then the farmer who fed others would not be hungry

 About a month ago, Ujjwala's husband also committed suicide

 After a farmer commits suicide, no one thinks about his family
 hindu businessline main radheshyaam jadhav ne ek report likhi he jisamen kaha he ki jab kisaan aatmahatya kar letaa he to uske parivaar ko lekar koi gambhir nazar nahin aata he
 It was also said that many widows get out of the government scheme and do not even get homes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 saamaajik kaaryakarta vidhwaa pension ke rup main kisaanon ke parivaar ke liye 1000 rupee pratimah kii maang kar rahe hai lekin sarkaar ke taraf se sirf 600 rupaya diya ja rahaa he or yah 600 rupaya bhi zyaadaatar vidhwaaon ke paas nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 In the month of June, the Maharashtra government said in the assembly that between 2015 and 2018, a total of 12021 farmers have committed suicide
 2011 se 2014 ke bich maharashtra main jab congress or ensipi kii sarkaar thi tab 6268 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 Between 2015 and 2018, this number has increased to 91 percent
 sochie agar fadanvis sarkaar ne 2014 main kisaanon ke liye jo vaada kiya tha wo sahi tareeke lagu hota to kisaan aatmahatya karne ke liye majaboor hote?isi maheene main punjab ke barnaala jile ke gaanv bhotna main 22 varshiya yuvak lovepreet singh ne karz ke kaaran aatmahatya kar lee
 5 people from four generations of this peasant family have committed suicide due to debt
 jis karj ke kaaran is parivaar kii chaar pidiyon ke 5 logon ne apni jaan de di unka naa to karj maaf ho sakaa naa hi parivaar ko koi aarthik sahaayta mil saki

 Lovepreet's father committed suicide about 18 months ago
 punjab sarkaar karj maafee kii baat karti rahati he lekin punjab main kisaanon kaa haal thik nahin he
 According to the news of Indian Express, 1280 farmers have committed suicide in Punjab in the last two years
 kuch din pehle punjab or haryana hai court ne kaha tha ki kisaanon ko fasalon kaa thikthak daam milanaa chahie
 The court had said that farmers should get MSP three times the cost
 ab yah dekhnaa he punjab sarkaar ise lekar kya kadam uthaati he
 The most interesting thing is that after 2016, there is no data of the total number of farmers who have committed suicide in the country
 2018 main loksabhaa main ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue krishi mantri radhamohan singh ne kaha tha ki neshnal krime record beuro ne 2016 ke baad kisaan aatmahatya kaa koi data publish nahin kiya he
 NCRB works inside the Ministry of Home Affairs and collects data on crime , including suicide
 NCRB kii website par uplabdh data ke hisaab se 2015 main desh main 8000 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he or sabase zyada maharashtra main 3030 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 According to the report, most farmers have committed suicide due to debt and crop failure

 haryana main bhi vidhaan sabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has said that 10 lakh farmers of Haryana who have taken loan from Agricultural Cooperative Society, District Cooperative Central Bank and are unable to return the money
 yaa jin kisaanon kaa khaataa NPA main tabdeel ho gaya he unhen penalty or byaaj se chhutkaaraa milegaa
 The question is that why did the government remember the farmers before the election? The farmers union says that the government should have forgiven the entire loan
 agar kisaan karj chukaane ke sthiti main hote to karj chukaa diya hota
 They are unable to repay the loan, hence their loan has become NPA
 kisaan union kaa kahana he kisaanon ne neshnal bank se bhi lone liya he, jo bahut zyada he lekin sarkaar vah maaf nahin kar rahi he
 Farmers can only take a maximum loan of 90 thousand from the cooperative bank, whereas the National Bank can take a loan of more than 90 thousand
 isiilie zyaadaatar kisaan neshnal bank se liye gaye lone ko lekar pareshaan hai lekin sarkaar aise kisaanon ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 The condition of farmers is bad in almost all states
 kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he
 The government should be more serious about the problem of farmers
 sirf skim kii ghoshnaa kar dene se kisaanon kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin ho jaataa he
 It also needs to be seen whether the scheme is implemented correctly

 Let me tell you that the hero of Modi's victory in 2014, Prashant Kishoreka's name was revealed when it was learned that he had prepared a strategy for BJP in the 2014 general elections

 Prashant Kishore is also considered to be the brainchild of Nitish Kumar's image
 chunaavon ke baad bhale hi jediu duusare number par rahi lekin nitish kumaar rajya ke mukhyamantri banane main kaamyaab rahe
 Prashant Kishor took over the electoral management of Congress in 2016
 congress ne prashanth kishor kii ipake yani indian political ection kamity ko upi vidhansabha or punjab vidhansabha chunaavon kii jimmedaari di gai

 In UP, the Congress did not get the expected success
 haalanki punjab main pike kii ranneeti safal rahi or punjab main captain amarinder singh mukhyamantri bane
 It is also not right to hold PK directly responsible for the Congress results in UP
 kyonki jaise-jaise chunavi paara chadh rahaa tha vaise-vaise vahaan ke sthaneey netaaon or prashanth kishor ke bich takaraav kii khabaren bhi saamne aati raheen

 The TMC currently has a government in the state, so it is not going to be less of a litmus test for PK as the BJP is steadily strengthening there and the party is working hard for the assembly elections there
 prashanth kishor kii ranneeti mamata banerjee ke aakraamak tevar or tiemasi ke badalte rukh main saaf najar aa rahaa he ab dekhnaa hoga ki unki mehnat kitni rang laati he
 Now PK has also taken the responsibility of formulating strategy for the Aam Aadmi Party in the assembly elections

 sena pramukh ke isi bayaan ke baad congress or anya partiyon ne kaha ki general ravat ko is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se pehle sochna chahie
 National Conference leader Mustafa Kamal had said that 'goons use this kind of language
 'tippaniyan On the other hand, Jitendra Singh has accused the Congress that the party is so disappointed with itself that it is bringing words which have not been used in the history of democracy till date
 unhone kaha ki sena pramukh ne chintaa jataai he, na ki chetavanee di he
 It was an appeal that no one should come close to the firing line but the Congress is showing something else
 jitendra ne kaha ki congress jo apane aapako rashtriya dal kahati he, sasti raajnneeti ke liye algaavvaadiyon kii bhashaa bolne par majaboor ho gai he
 Regarding the complaint by the soldiers on social media, the army chief had said that with this he also said that there are some of our jawans who may be adopting such a stance through propaganda in social media, but their kind If attitude is there, we will act strictly
 guuruuvaar ko sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne hidaayat bhare lahaze main kaha tha ki sainya oparation ke dauraan javaanon par patharav karne vaale logon ko aatankwaadiyon kaa sahyogi mana jayega or unase sakhti se nibata jayega
 General Rawat said that those who want to help terrorism by showing the flag of ISIS and Pakistan will be considered anti-national and will not be spared
 sena pramukh ne yah bhi kaha ki - main chetavanee nahin, samajhane ke liye apni taraf se hidaayat de rahaa hum ki agar aap baj nahin aate hai or agar aap suraksha balon ke oparation main baadha banate hai to ham sakhti se karrwai karenge
 After this statement by the Army Chief, the Congress and other parties said that General Rawat should think before using such language
 neshnal conference ke netaa mustafa camel ne kaha tha ki 'is tarah kii bhashaa to gunde istemaal karte hai
 Comments udhar jitendra singh ne congress par aarope lagaaya ki he ki party khud se itani niraash he ki aise shabd laa rahi he jise loktantr ke itihaas main aaj tak istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 He said that the army chief has expressed concern, not a warning
 vah ek apil thi ki koi bhi firing line ke kareeb na aae lekin congress kuch or hi dikhaa rahi he
 Jitendra said that the Congress, which calls itself a national party, has been forced to speak the language of separatists for cheap politics
 soshal media par javaanon dwaara shikaayat karne ko lekar sena pramukh ne kahatha ki iske saath unhone yah bhi kaha ki hamaare kuch jawan hai jo soshal media main propaganda ke jariye ho saktaa he is tarah ke rukh ko apana rahe hon, lekin unka is tarah kaa ravaiya rahaa to ham sakhti se pesh aaenge

 The act of Asaram, who describes himself as a religious teacher, has made him a spectacle, but this spectacle is showing disrespect to the law
 asaram ke bol vivaadon ko janm dete rahe
 Finger kept on his ashram and religious activities
 in par kai gambhir aarope lage or ab to unhone ek nae bol se ek nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 This time, he is speaking for the Chief Minister of the state whose police can arrest Asaram in the rape charges
 khud ko 74 saal kaa boodha bataane vaale baba asaram ab jagah-jagah safai dete phir rahe hai ki wo balaatkaari baba nahin hai
 Ram forgot his name, Kirtan forgot Bhajan
 kya karen, aarope hi aisa laga he
 a 16-year-old girl has accused Baba of rape
 balaatkaar ke aaropon ne asaram ko niraashaaram kar diya he
 All the evidence and the statements of the girl are making Baba in the dock, Baba has dodged the law many times, but for the first time he is caught in a rape case
 kanoon kaa shikanja unke ird gird kas rahaa he
 a minor girl accused Asaram that he raped her in a farmhouse near Jodhpur, but see that the Rajasthan government did not act
 aakhir ashok gahalot kii chuppi kaa sabab kya he? kahin asaram ne gahalot ke puraane rishte to kanoon ke raste main pathar nahin ban gayi hai?asaram baapu abhi tak kanoonee shikanje se dur hai
 The matter has also reached Parliament and there is a lot of uproar but both Rajasthan government and administration are running away from speaking on Asaram Bapu
 aakhir kyon ashok gahalot asaram ko giraftaar na karne ke bahaane bana rahe hai
 Asaram Bapu said in Ahmedabad that i keep sending messages to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 wo bhi mujhe jaanate hai, wo kai baar mere paas aa bhi chuke hai
 He is such a man that many times he comes and goes to our cowshed without calling, there is so much love for our cowshed
 wo bhi in batoo main aakar kaise kaccha-pakkaa bol gayi ki saadhuon ko apana aachran vyavhaar sudhaarna chaiye
 i wonder
 ashok gahalot ke saath asaram ke rishte pehle kaarykaal se hi behad achche ban gaye the
 It was in Gehlot's first term that Asaram opened his ashram in Rajasthan
 gahalot sarkaar ne to gaushala ke naam par tonk jile ke nivai main 100 bigha jameen asaram ko de diya jiskaa, udghaatan khud ashok gahalot ne kiya tha
 Apart from this, Asaram has 23 ashrams in Rajasthan and more than 6 farm houses
 rajasthan main asaram ke samarthak badi taadaad main hai to ashok gahalot ke liye kisi votbank se kam nahin
 Asaram's tall stature in the eyes of the Rajasthan government can be gauged from the same evidence that when Aaj Tak tried to talk to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan on August 23, then it was said that whatever we had to say, we said it yesterday, the rest You talk to the police
 rajasthan ke dijipi harishchand meena ke kamare ke baahar do ghante tak aaj tak ke samvaadadaata baithe rahe, kyonki kaha gaya ki sahab so rahe hai or jab jaage to kaha gaya dijipi sahab somvaar ko milenge
 After Rajasthan BJP President Vasundhara Raje waited 6 hours outside the Dholpur City Palace, it was said that Madam did not have time till nine o'clock in the night
 camere se itar police ke adhikari bhi baatcheet main saaf-saaf kah rahe hai ki unke paas is baat ke thos saboot hai ki 15 agast ko asaram or ladki jodhpur se 30 kilometre dur mathania ke hariom ashram main hi the
 But the arrest of Asaram has not been allowed by the police yet
 jaahir si baat he jab aaropon ke kathghare main khadey asaram khud ashok gahalot ke saath rishton kaa hawala de rahe hai to phir koi himmat kaise dikhaaen?safai to thik he, lekin sawaal he ki balaatkaar jaise sangeen aarope ke baavjood asaram kii giraftaar kyon nahin hui? aakhir kyon kanoon kaa haath asaram tak ab tak pahunch nahin paaya? aakhir koun he jo asaram ko bachaa rahaa he?rajasthan kii congress sarkaar ko dargiraftaar se dur asaram ko lekar sawaal isliye bhi saamne hai, kyonki cese darj hone ke kai din baad tak rajasthan kii gahalot sarkaar maun he
 The compulsion of political betting is such that the questioning should have been from Asaram, but from the ACP to the commissioner, he is questioning the victim itself
 darasal iske peeche asli kehani ye he ki gahalot sarkaar ko asaram ke sindhi samaaj or unke andhabhakton ke vot kaa haath se nikalne kaa dar sata rahaa he
 Sindhi society has its influence in about 40 seats in Rajasthan, of which Asaram has a deep penetration
 congress ko dar he ki kahin asaram se bair saal ke aakhir main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main unke liye ghate kaa sauda sabit na ho jaae
 BJP is also growing seeing votebank BJP is not behind in Votbank politics
 vasundhara raaje or bijepi netaaon se asaram kii gahari najdiki he
 That is why the blind BJP is also standing with Asaram instead of the victim
 rajasthan bijepi kii mahila morcha kii adhyaksh suman sharma hon yaa uma bharti, bijepi bhi apana vot bank dekhakar chal rahi he

 The Central Information Commission has pulled up the environment ministry for not being transparent in the matter of genetically modified (GM) food
 kendriya soochna ayog ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah jiem mustard (sarson) se judi sari jaankaree or aankade 30 april se pehle saarvajanik kare
 Although GM Mustard is not yet allowed to grow and sell as a crop in the fields, it has been developed
 agar sarkaar kii genetic ejineering apruval cameti – jo ki is maamle main niamak body he - iske liye anumati detii he to jiem sarson pehla jiem khaadya hoga jise kheton main ugaaya jayega
 At present, only GM cotton is grown in our country
 tippaniyan Kavita Krugunti, an environmental activist, had sought information from the government about this, but after the information was not given by the environment ministry, she had to turn to the Central Information Commission which has ordered this information to be revealed
 jiem fasalon ko lekar pehle bhi vivaad hota rahaa he
 Earlier, GM brinjal could not even get permission to grow, fearing health hazards
 paryaavaran kaaryakartaaon kii shikaayat rahi he ki sarkaar kii genetic apruval cameti is bare main paardarshita se kaam nahin kar rahi he
 The Central Information Commission has asked the government to make all the information and data related to GM Mustard (mustard) public before 30 April
 jiem mustard ko haalanki abhi kheton main bataur fasal ugane or bechney kii ijaajat nahin he lekin ise viksit kiya ja chukaa he
 If the Government's Genetic Engineering Approval Committee - which is the regulatory body in this case - allows for this, GM mustard will be the first GM food to be grown in the fields
 abhi hamaare desh main keval jiem kapaas ko hi ugaaya jaataa he
 The comments is bare main ek paryaavaran kaaryakarta kavita kuruganti ne sarkaar se jaankaree maangi thi, lekin paryaavaran mantralay kii ore se jaankaree na diye jane ke baad unhen kendriya soochna ayog kaa rukh karnaa padaa jisane is jaankaree ko zaahir karne kaa aadesh diya he
 There has been controversy about GM crops before
 isse pehle swasthya sambandhi khataron kaa dar jataate hue jiem bangan ko ugane kii anumati bhi nahin mil pai
 Environmental activists have complained that the government's genetic approval committee is not working transparently about this

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while refusing to sign the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, today clarified that the proposal of Group Eight banning enrichment and reprocessing technology will have no effect on India as there is no consensus in the Nuclear Suppliers Group
 
 apni haal kii videsh yatraaon se utpann sthiti ke bare main loksabhaa main sadasyon kii chintaaon ko dur karte hue singh ne is bare main bahut safagoi se kaha ki main ek baar phir yaad dilaanaa chahta hum ki jab tak vishwa paimaane parmaanu nirastrikaran nahin hota he, bharat dwaara ek gaiyr parmaanu hathiyaar sampann desh ke rup main parmaanu aprasar sandhi main shaamil hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 He also clarified that there would be no pressure on India to use enrichment and reprocessing materials and technology, not to use foreign origin used fuel for its security features
 singh ne italy main haal main sampann samooh aath kii baithak main paarit us prastaav kaa zikr kiya jisamen sanvardhit evam purnprasanskaran praudyogiki ko enpiti par hastakshar nahin karne vaale deshon ko nahin hastantarit karne kaa praavdhaan he
 He said that our group does not have any kind of civil nuclear agreement with eight, but separate bilateral agreements with France, Russia and America

 When asked about the notice, Raut said that he is out of town and he is not aware of any notice
 haalanki is puure maamle ko itnaa tool die jane par kuch adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki jin logon ko senior bachchan ke saath stage share karne kaa mauka nahi mila ye unki harakat ho sakati he
 An official, on the condition of anonymity, said what he had done wrong
 mahanayake ke saath koun nahi naachna chahega
 The funny thing is that Chief Minister Raman Singh himself welcomed Amitabh with state facilities
 bachchan pehle singh ke yahaan hi tehre jis par sthaneey media main khabaren bhi ai
 After this the state government announced that Amitabh would give his voice in the promotional video of the state

 Kale Khote is his business, o owner! Where have all the good brothers, o owners? This tinkling lion belongs to Aziz Ansari who is a big signature of Urdu poetry and lives in Indore
 yon to indore shaayari ke kshetra main raahat indori ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The tone of relief is undoubtedly special
 par haal hi main meri nigaah indore ke hi shaayar azeez ansaari ke hindi main aae shaayari ke collection -hawa josh main he- par gayi to laga indore kii aabhohawaa main hi yah khubi he ki vahaan raahat ke pehle hi azeez ansaari jaise shaayar paidaa hue hai, jinaki shaayari bhi kam raahat dene vaali nahin he
 Aziz Ansari, who was eight years older and seventy-six years old from relief, continued to work in various positions in All India Radio
 naukari ke aakhri saalon main indore akashwani se 2002 main centre nideshak pad se sevanivrutt hue tathaa gazalon, geeton, naat, bhajan aadi vidhaon main apana haath ravaan karte rahe
 So far, many collections of his ghazals have been overshadowed, but due to hesitancy to print his writing late, he remained somewhere in the back
 azeez ansaari kii gazalon main aise gahare abjakarvations hai jo hamen jivan kii pechidagiyon se vabsta karaate hai
 How few people in the world became rich from dishonest and swords came in the hands of reading and writing community
 unki gajalen is baat ko apane andaaj main kahati hai-kal talak to nange bhukhe the sabhi is gaanv mesub ye kothi or ye kaaren kahaan se aa gayin?inako padhane hamane bheja tha kalam dekar 'azeez'inke haathon main ye talavaarein kahaan se aa gayin ?azeez ansaari kii shaayari kii nigaah jivan kii un sari buraaiyon par he, jis par maamuli aadmi kii nazar nahin jaati
 In the years that have gone by, politics has ruined the country in the name of hindu-muslim, temple-mosque, that instead of the country's basic progress, we have imported foreign technologies and we have changed into a country consuming electronic goods
 viksit deshon kii puunji ne hamen nirantar kamjor tathaa takanic ke maamle main parashrayi banaaya he
 The compromises we have made in terms of ecology have proved to be a hindrance in the way of the betterment of our country
 ansaari saab kii ek or ghazal ke chand, ashaar mulaahijaa hai-kaale khote inke dhandhe, i maalikkahaan gaye sab achche bande, i maalikinaki ibaadat, inaki akidat dikhalavamandir masjid inke dhandhe, i maalikruth gayi hariyaali mere angan sebaithe he khamosh parinde, i malikzeez ansaari kii shaayari insaaniyat ke jazbe se bhari he
 In it, there are shadows of the sunlight of life, poignant tahrirs of reality
 bolchaal kaa lahaza unki shaayari ko jeevant banaata he, to jivananubhav unki shaayari main vishvisneeyata kaa rang bharte hai, ve insaan ko jivan main faili visangatiyon kii yaad dilaate hai to uske upachaar kaa rasta bhi
 The Ghazals of Bade Bahr are with him and he has written a lot in Chhoti Bahar too
 jahaan ve is ahsaas ko jite hai ki-sahamaa-sahamaa apana jivan chaaro oresulag rahaa he jaise rindhan chaaro oravahin is ullas ko bhi mahasoos karte hai-fail gayi he uske aane se khushboomahak rahaa ho jaise chandan chaaro ore
 Even though his name has not been included in the famous poets, his poetry is composed from the architecture of the Urdu Jadid poetry
 unke kehane kaa andaaj apana he
 In what way do they say this - Our whereabouts of all the sorrows, our hearts, where the mother does not eradicate, the mother will eradicate the hunger, Who is the grain on earth, who has a treasure of injuries, 'azeez' will get you treasure Nowhere 'hawa josh main he' sangrah azeez ansaari ko hindi pathakon kii jamaat main lokapriy banayega, isamen andeh nahin
 The way they offer better life through their poetry is reflected somewhere in their ghazals
 main-main karti is duniya main ve kis tarah ham ke hami dikhte hai, unki hi ghazal kaa ek sher dekhen-jahaan main uski izzat kam nahin helbon pe jiske main he, ham nahin he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very fond of building new relationships
 lekin in rishton kii aad main aap piem sahab se zyada ummiden na laga lijiega
 Explain har insaan siaidi kaa inspector dayaa nahin ho saktaa, jo saare band daravaaje tod de
 These days Modi is asking the countries, industrialists and all the investors from all over the world to come to India and manufacture anything
 is nyote or skim ko piem mahoday ne 'mek in india' kaa naaraa diya he
 But dear friends, sisters and brothers of my and Modi ji, you should know that there are some such sad tears about which PM Modi cannot say to anyone, 'less Make in India'
 jaaniye PM modi kin maamalon main nahin kahenge aaie 'mek in india'1
 Youth medicine: Our friend Rupi cannot say to anyone that you make medicine to make young people in India, because if such a drug is made, then the desire to be young can boil in the mind of LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi is
 aise main piem sahab ke 2019 chunaav ke armaanon par yuvaaon (adwani or joshi) ko mauka dene kii majaburi baari pad sakati he
 That is why Modi cannot say about this drug, Make in India
 2
 Rahul Gandhi's image building: Tiny and cute looking Rahul Gandhi is a staunch opponent of Modi
 rahul kii lokapriyata modi ke mukaable utani nahin he
 Above all, he is also the opposition leader of Modi's Cute
 aise main modi kisi se bhi ye nahin kah sakate ki bharat main aaie or rahul gandhi ko lokapriy banaaie
 Does anyone dig a pit for themselves? haa ye baat bhi he ki khilne kudane kii umr main bacchon ko jabardastee raajnneeti main laane ke liye lod nahin daalana chahie
 3
 dharna:vikaas kii raah par sabase bada roda uskaa virodh he
 Anyway, those who have Kejriwal in their own country, how can they ask someone else to sit
 isiilie modi kabhi kisi se nahin kah sakate ki aaie aap bharat main dharna dijie yaa dharne ke liye ekajute hoie
 Thankfully India is self-sufficient in this matter
 thanks tu 'aap'
 4
 jasusi upkaran:jasusi or chugali karnaa paap he
 The Snoopgate case upset Modi as much as he dreamed of becoming PM, either God knows it or Amit Shah
 vipaksh modi par 'cobra' ke mafik lipatane laga tha
 In some way, now Modi has emerged
 aise main modi kisi se 'aaie bharat main jasusi upkaran banaaie' kahkar gade murde thodi ukhaadenge
 5
 shaadi par film:oh
 Once again the aching veil
 do alag namakan main vivaahit or avivaahit bharne par fanse or baad main shrimati jashodaben modi kii khabaren media main aa jane ke baad modi kaa cheharaa bhale hi band kamare main lekin laal to jarur hua hoga
 In such a situation, PM sahib cannot say to any director, producer, Hollywood and any person of Bollywood, that let's make a film or documentary on my wedding
 khaali-pili film kii philim banane se acha he na kaho,' kam mek in india'
 6 
 nai sarkaar:modi kaa bhagavat puraana rupi bhaashan, lakhon kaaryakartaaon or amit shah kii aidi se lekar chotii tak kaa jor lagane ke baad bijepi kii sarkaar ban pai he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot say in any country that let's form a government in India
 apane pet par
 Oh sorry, no one dares to kick his patriotic dreams, friends
 7
 UPSC questions in Hindi: Except Rajinikanth, no one in the world has the courage to understand the questions of UPSC exam in Hindi
 ye baat bharat kaa lagbhag har shaks samajhataa he
 That is why PM sahib cannot say to any country like tablet computer (tablet computer) that let's understand the Hindi of UPSC exam in India or make a software for translation
 isiilie is maamle main bhi dont mek in india
 8
 live tivi intervyuu:ab tak ke itihaas ko dekhte hue yah lagbhag tay he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kisi tivi channel se ye nahin kah sakate ki aaie bharat main meraa live intervyuu lijie
 So don't make this one in India
 iske peeche vajah sambhavat: desi patrakaron ko is baat kaa dilasa dena he ki tum nahin, to koi bhi nahin
 Opponents need to relate it with the feeling of indigenous love
 9
 Windmill: It is a dirty habit of people
 jahaan modi naam suna nahin, hawa or lahar kii baat sunate hi bahes karne lag jate hai
 In such a situation, PM sahab cannot say to anyone that low make windmill in India
 kyonki vipaksh ise modi lahar se jodakar kah saktaa he ki darasal modi hawa sirf duusare logon kii vajah se he
 That is why listen to the song 'naa aana ish deshi meri lado' from the windmills and be quiet
 10
 Culture: BJP, RSS and Modi himself are also supporters of Indian culture
 aise main modi kisi se bharat main aakar kisi nai samskruti ke vistaar ke liye nahin kah sakate
 Especially Western culture
 jahaan 'khullam-khulla pyaar karenge ham donon' pratha kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 Uma Bharti, who is trying to make a new culture in India by cleaning the Ganges, Ramdev and Yogi Type Star campaigners shaking the ribs can be considered bad and not taking everyone along is against the mood of PM Narendra Modi
 note:agar aap kisi ke samarthak urf bhakt hai or is vyangy ko padhate hue aapaki aatma ko dhachaka pahunchaa ho
 Sorry about that but just one thing for you
 sabase pehle plis mek loktantr in india
 Thanks to the readers for giving me the freedom to speak and write
 congress ne vasundhara ke bangale kii jaanch kii maang kicongress boli- raaje ne bangale par kharche 2,000 karodabijepi ne kaha- gahalot ne shuru kii thi yah parampararajasthan main purv mukhyamantriyon ke bangale khaali karaane or suvidha khatm karne ke rajasthan hai court ke aadesh ke baad bijepi or congress main aarope-pratyarope kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Congress leader Ghanshyam Tiwari has alleged that former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje brought a bill related to housing and facilities of former chief ministers in the assembly in 2017 to save her house
 tiwadi ne kaha ki us awaas par vasundhara raaje ne 2 hajaar karod rupye kharch kiye hai
 It is not the residence of any former chief minister but the palace, which should be investigated
 hai court ke aadesh ke baad logon ko us awaas ko dikhaanaa chahie ki aakhir sarkari paise kaa durupyog kaise kiya gaya he
 Let us tell you that Ghanshyam Tiwari has been organizing the movement for this house of Vasundhara Raje for a long time
 udhar, is faisle ke baad 2017 main vidhansabha main is vidheyak ko pesh karne vaali vasundhara sarkaar ke tatkaaleen sansadeey kaary mantri or ab bijepi ke rajasthan vidhansabha ke up netaa rajendra rathod ne vasundhara raaje kaa paksh liya he
 He said that former Chief Ministers are people sitting in very large positions, who need many facilities
 unhone kaha ki inhen jaruraton ke maddenjar hamane in suvidhaon ko lagu kiya tha
 Now the order of Rajasthan High Court has come, then we will study it first
 lekin ek baat tay he ki bijepi ne congress ke parampara ko hi aage badhaayaa tha
 Rathore said that all former Chief Ministers of the Congress, from former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, had bungalow facilities and it all started in the Congress Raj
 yahaan tak ki satta main aane ke baad bhi mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne is vidheyak ke liye hai court main pairvi kii thi
 On the matter of vacating the residence of former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, Rajendra Rathore said that this is his personal matter, but when the order of Rajasthan High Court has come, we feel that everyone should follow it
 hai court ke aadesh ke khilaaf supreme court main janaa he yaa nahin, iskaa faisla rajasthan sarkaar ko karnaa he, bijepi rajasthan hai court ke faisle kaa swaagat karti he
 Explain that the Rajasthan High Court has given a big blow to the former Chief Ministers
 justise prakaash gupta ne rajasthan mantri vetan sanshodhan adhinium 2017 ko avaidh ghoshit kar diya he
 Under this Act, there was a provision of many facilities in Rajasthan to former Chief Ministers
 ab court ke faisle ke baad rajya ke sabhi purv mukhyamantriyon ko 2 maheene ke andar apane bangale khaali karne padenge or sarkari staff lautaanaa padegaa
 According to the decision of the court, the former chief ministers will be given 2 months and after that if they do not vacate, then they will be charged money from the market price
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne media main chal rahi un khabaron kaa khandan kiya he jisamen daawa kiya ja rahaa tha kiandiemen loksabhaa chunaav ke liye siton kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya he
 Sushil Modi said by tweeting that no formal decision has been taken for the general elections in the NDA in 2019, nor is there any dispute about it
 haalanki seat bantwaare ko lekar abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 We have a target of winning only all 40 seats
 endie main 2019 ke chunaav ke liye seat bantwaare par na koi aupchaarik faisla hua he, na koi vivaad he
 We have a target of winning only all 40 seats
 sabhi ghatak isi udeshy par kaam kar rahe hai

 com / jxovwcfscp— Sushil Kumar Modi (@sushilmodi)august 30, 2018upmukhyamantri modi ne kaha ki sabhi ghatak isi udeshy par kaam kar rahe hai
 Those who see bird's eye do not see anything else
 isse pehle sutron se yah khabar aa rahi thi ki endie ke ghatak dalon ke bich seat bantwaare kaa formula taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 Out of 40 seats in Bihar, NDA had won 31 seats, of which BJP won 22 seats, Lokjan Shakti Party in 6 seats and Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP won 3 seats
 is baar janata dal united (jediu) ke endie main shaamil hone kii vajah se jo nayaa formula taiyaar hua he, uske anusaar bijepi 22 ke badale 20 siton par, lokjanshkti party 6 siton ke badale 5 siton par or upendra kushvaha kii party ko 3 ke badale 2 site milengi
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumarki Party JDU which won just 2 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, this time it will get 12 seats
 ek seat kushvaha kii party se alag hue arun kumaar ko mil sakati he, lekin susheel modi ne twit karke is formule ko khaarij kar diya he

 The law and order of which the Yogi government does not get tired of patting itself, the same law and order was seen on Monday evening when a man carrying money in a cash van near Raj Bhavan was shot dead by criminals
 hatya ke baad badmaash paise kii thili lootakar chalate bane
 The murder and plunder of Lucknow's most posh area near Raj Bhavan and Vidhan Sabha has woken the Yogi government
 lut or murder kasanasanikhej vaakyatab hua jab ek bike savaar ne dindahaade bank ke saamne khadi cash vine main baithe guard ko goli markar hatya kar di
 At the same time, the custodian present with the guard also fired and escaped with a bag full of notes
 bag main lagbhag 6 lakh 30 hajaar rupe maujuud the
 The mob and the police rushed to the hospital where the guard died
 ghatana itane viviipi aria main hui jahaan ek taraf rajbhavan or lagbhag 500 meter kii duuri par mukhyamantri kaa awaas maujuud tha
 Police reached the spot and are searching for the accused with the help of CCTV footage
 cash vine kaa darwaja khatkhataakar maari golijankaree ke mutabik lakhanu ke sabase viviipi road rajbhavan ke paas exis bank ke saamne sarvice len main esaypiel company kii cash vine khadi thi
 Inside the cash van, security guard Indra Mohan was sitting with a bag of cash in his hand
 tabhi motor cycle savaar ek badmaash aayaa or usne cash vine ke darvaaze ke shishe par dastak di or get kholane ko kaha to indra mohan ne sheesha kholaa
 Then the miscreant shot Indra Mohan and snatched the cash bag from his hand
 goli kii aawaaj sunakar paas main khadaa castodian umesh vahaan pahunchaa to badmaash ne uske bhi pair par goli maar di or cash kaa bag lootakar faraar ho gaya
 When some people gathered on hearing the sound of the bullet, two people were bled to see the police was informed
 police ne donon ghayalon ko aspataal pahunchaaya jahaan guard indra mohan ko mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya, jabaki umesh kaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 After the incident, the driver of the cash van, Ram Sewak, is being questioned by the police regarding the incident
 is vaardaat ke baad upi police ke hosh ud gaye, kyonki yah ghatana uttar pradesh ke sabase surakshit maane jane vaale ilaake main hui thi
 Estimate the flow of hands and feet of the police with the fact that soon after the incident, the DGP also reached the spot and took charge of the investigation
 mukhyamantri awaas or vidhansabha ke bich hui lut or hatya kii vaardatjis jagah par bekhauf badmaash dwarahatya or lootki sansanikhez vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya, us jagah se kuch hi duuri par kanoon mantri brijesh pathak kaa bangala bhi he
 Apart from this, the incident site is at such a place from where VVIP movement keeps happening throughout the day
 iske alaava ghatana sthal se agar dekha jaae to mukhyamantri awaas vidhansabha kii duuri bhi do-do sau meter ke daayre main hi he
 The location of the incident near Raj Bhavan puts a question mark on the police's promptness
 akhilesh ne lut or hatya kii vaardaat par twit kar ksaa tandhkhilesh yadav ne twit kar kar upi sarkaar ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki rajyapal or mukhyamantri kii naak ke neeche hatya or lut kii vaardaat ho gai or ab dekhte hai ki encounter vaali sarkaar kya bataati he
 Recently, the SSP was transferred to Lucknow because some crimes were committed in the city, but after this big incident it remains to be seen what kind of action Yogi Adityanath takes
 video-aadamkhor baghin avani ko maaraa gaya a week before the 2010-11 railway budget, noted social activist and leader of Narmada Bachao Andolan, Medha Patkar has demanded from Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee that she announce maximum participation of local people in this task while announcing the new 'catering Policy'
 Make sure patkar ne kaha, ‘bhartiya railway dwaara lagu vartmaan khanpan niti main bhartiya railway khanpan evam paryaton nigam (iarsitisi) kaa nivida prakriya main ekadhikaar he
 In the new policy, railways should ensure maximum participation of local people in this process
 ’duusari ore, railway sutron kaa kahana he ki rail mantri mamata banerjee dwaara loksabhaa main pesh kiye jane vaale rail bajet main nai khanpan niti kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi athwa nahin, yah abhi tay nahin he, lekin yah nishchit he ki yah ab se kisi vakt bhi aa sakati he
 Social activist Medha Patkar alleges that the selfish people rooted in the current 'catering policy' of the railways try to hinder the process by filling up the rates in the tenders so that it is delayed and in the meantime they can influence the concerned authorities
 is bare main poochne par iarsitisi bhopal main padasth mukhya kshetreey prabandhak virendra singh ne kaha ki railway board ne nai nividaayen aamantrit karne se manaa karte hue koi likhit nirdesh jari nahin kiye hai
 He said that the new catering policy is being considered by the Railway Minister and this policy can come anytime
 ullekhneey he ki pichley saal disambar main rail mantri ne bhartiya railway par ‘shwetapatr’ pesh karte vakt kuch operataron dwaara khanpan license jhatak lene ke masale par kaha tha, ‘khanpan license main ekarupata laane or sthaneey logon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke liye is vyavastha kii samgr samiksha kii jarurat he
 'social activist Medha Patkar has also asked Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee to rehabilitate those removed from railway stations due to the current catering policy
 unhone kaha ki railway kaa kaam keval laabh kamanaa hi nahin he, balki adhik se adhik logon ko rojgaar ke avasar pradaan karnaa bhi he
 Politics begins with scope
 22 janvari ko jab pashchim bengal ke malda main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii raily main thik-thaak bheed jute gai to yah shaayad usee gunjaaish kii khoj thi ki bhagava party desh ke madhya or pashchimi ilaakon se hone vaale siton ke sambhavit nuksaan kii bharpai nai jameen se karnaa chaahati he
 The importance of this rally can be understood from the fact that Shah reached Malda was meditating with fever but the rally was not postponed
 isi sabha main bhaajapa netaa rahul sinha ne chikhakar kahah ladaai saraasri bijepi banaam trinmule
 
 
 Jikhene Padma Phool like this, Oikhene chhoto-chhoti Ghaser Fuller's type? (the fight is directly between BJP vs Trinamool
 
 
 jahaan camel kaa phool aa chukaa he, vahaan ab chote-chote ghaas (trin) ke phulon kii kya darkaar?) bhaajapa yahi chaahati bhi he
 It wants to directly contest the electoral battle in West Bengal versus BJP and is eyeing the swing votes that were in the communists' court till the last elections and are generally anti-mamata votes
 bhaajapa ko ashanka he ki rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main use aadhi siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the party has started Mission 123 to make up for it
 yah abhiyaan un 123 loksabhaa siton main se adhiktam par jeet hasil karne kaa he jinhen prachand modi lahar ke baavjood party 2014 main jeet nahin pai thi
 Only last year, the BJP divided these 123 seats into 25 groups and appointed them in charge
 ab, jab chunaav bilkul sir par hai, party ne booth str par dhyaan kendrit kar diya he
 This is the strategy of Narendra modi-shah which has given good results in almost all the assembly elections in the last four and a half years
 in 123 sambhaavnashil sansadeey siton main se 77 to sirf pashchim bengal, assam or odisha main hai
 Of these, the BJP could win only 10 in 2014
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa ko agar bahut urvar jameen maaloom pad rahi he to yah mahaj khamakhyali nahin he
 In the last panchayat election, the saffron party achieved good results despite the dominance of the ruling Trinamool Congress and came second behind the Left Front
 ab bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron kii najar lagbhag 22 siton par he
 The BJP has only two seats in the current Lok Sabha from West Bengal - Asansol and Darjeeling
 par taaja ranneeti ke tahat bhaajapa kaa mukhya rankshetra soobe kaa jangal mahal ilaaka he
 The BJP has been very active in this area for some time
 shah ne chah maheene pehle hi, 28 june ko purulia jile main party netaaon ke saath baithak karke iraade jataa die the
 At the same time, Prime Minister Modi also held a 'krishi Kalyan Samagra' rally in Midnapore
 sanket spasht hai
 By the way, the Jungle Mahal spread over Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore districts was once a strong Maoist stronghold and has six Lok Sabha seats
 is ilaake se bhaajapa ke liye haal main acchhee khabaren hi ai hai
 In the recent panchayat elections, the basic vote bank of the Trinamool Congress has shown a change in support of the tribals, due to which the Trinamool has lost at least 34 per cent panchayat seats in three districts
 jangal mahal main kai safal sarkari yojanaon ke baavjood trinmul jhadiram ke kuch adivasee panchayat kshetron main namakan daakhil nahin kar saki or bhaajapa ko badhat lene se roak nahin pai
 Sources in the Trinamool state that all forces in the Jungle Mahal area have united against Mamata
 in jilon main in takaton ne bhaajapa ko gupt samarthan diya or party ne purulia jile kii ek-tihaai gram panchayaton main jeet hasil kii tathaa jhadiram jile main takreeban aadhi siten bhi jeet leen
 Therefore, the entire focus of the BJP is on tribal dominated seats of North Bengal and Jungle Mahals like Balurghat, Cooch Behar, Alipur Duar, Jalpaiguri, Malda North, Purulia, Jadagram, Medinipur, Krishnanagar and Howrah
 par bhaajapa kaa mishan bengal itnaa aasaan bhi nahin rahane vaala
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP had got two Lok Sabha seats and 16 in the state
 8 fisadi vot mili the
 But in the 2016 assembly elections, bjp's vote share fell to 10
 2 fisad ho gaya
 Actually, there are other aspects of the mathematics of the BJP
 2014 main bhaajapa teen loksabhaa siton par duusare number par rahi thi
 Last time the BJP was in alliance with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in the hilly areas and due to this the Darjeeling seat came to its account
 par is baar darjeeling seat kii raah bhi aasaan nahin hogi
 In 2014, Trinamool Congress won the famous footballer Baichung Bhutia from BJP
 es
 Was fielded against Ahluwalia
 jijeem kii madad or modi lahar ke veg se bhaajapa is chunauti ko paar kar gai thi
 But this time the GJM-BJP alliance has broken
 aise main maujuuda seat par bhi khatra mandara rahaa he
 In 2014, two of the three Lok Sabha seats where the BJP finished second, fall in the urban area of kolkata
 bhaajapa kii chintaa he ki kolkata mamata kaa apana ilaaka he
 The third seat of bjp's second position was Malda Dakshin seat, where the Muslim population is more than half of the total population
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main jin saat vidhansabha siton main bhaajapa duusare sthaan par rahi thi, unamem adhiktar chhitrai hui hai
 The BJP is looking for some acceptable faces in the state to cross the electoral stalemate
 kaddavar trinmul congress netaa mukul roy pehle hi bhaajapa main shaamil ho chuke hai or saumitr khan ke aane ke baad bhaajapa ab sirf roopa ganguli or locket chatarji jaise chehron par nirbhar nahin he
 The grassroots leaders like Rahul Sinha and Dilip Ghosh of West Bengal BJP are struggling but their mass base is not much wider
 aise main, party kuch lokapriy or mashhoor pratyaashiyon kii khoj main he
 Actress Moushumi Chatterjee has also recently joined BJP after Khan joined BJP
 bhaajapa sutron kaa kahana he ki trinmul ke kam se kam chah saansad unke sampark main hai
 Most of these are considered close to Roy
 pashchim bengal ke chunaavon main muslim vot behad faislakun sabit hote hai
 In fact, one of the many reasons behind the collapse of the Left's fort was the change of Muslim votes and standing behind Mamata
 par uttar bengal main adheer ranjan choudhary or divangat ab gani khan choudhary ke parivaar kii shashakt maujuudagi kii vajah se us ilaake kii kam se kam chah siton par congress majboot he or vahaan kaa muslim voter congress ke paksh main he
 Of the four seats that Congress won in 2014, all of them are in North Bengal
 malda, murshidaabad or uttari deenajpur main muslim aabaadi bahusankhyak he jabaki dakshini choubees pargana, uttari choubees pargana, nadia or veerbhum jilon main ek-chauthai se adhik aabaadi musalamaanon kii he
 The truth is that the election of Muslims in Bengal has proved to be a victory
 2006 tak muslimon kaa saath vam morche ko hasil tha or uski jeet bhi utani hi vishaal thi
 But the scenario began to change with the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, when the trinamool-congress alliance won a total of 26 parliamentary seats, winning nearly sixty percent Muslim-majority seats
 aisa hi 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi hua
 But in 2014, Trinamool's alliance with the Congress was broken, yet Mamata remained a favorite of Muslims
 trinmul ko 34 siten hasil huin
 In the last four elections, Trinamool won 39% Muslim majority seats
 haalanki, is baar bhaajapa kaa daanv he ki vam morcha kaa janaadhar jin sthanon par chhija he vahaan uske vot bank main send lagaai jaae
 There are 36 assembly seats in the state where the Muslim population is relatively less, where the lead on the rest of the Trinamool parties decreases to 12 per cent
 yaheen ve siten hai jahaan hindu voton ko dhruvikrut karke bhaajapa jeet ke sapane sanjo sakati he
 On the other hand, there are at least 14 Lok Sabha seats where the Muslim population is up to 40 per cent
 yahaan vot share kaa antar (vam morcha banaam congress banaam trinmul) 10 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 Here the BJP is hoping for a possible split in Muslim votes from a multi-cornered contest and polarization of Hindu votes
 agar, yahaan muslim voton main bikharaav hua to bhaajapa kii baanchhein khil sakati hai
 The party is understanding the importance of Muslim votes in the state
 isliye panchayat chunaav main party ne kareeb 850 muslim pratyaashee utaare the or unamem se kareeb aadhe log jeet bhi gaye the
 The bjp's strategy is not to allow the Muslim votes to go outright in Bengal and to consolidate the Hindu votes by dividing it into a multi-cornered contest
 hindu voton ko ekajute karne ke liye hi bhaajapa ne soobe main rathyatra nikaalane kii yojana banaai thi
 The three-phase visit would have touched 77,000 polling stations in the state
 par rajya sarkaar ne yatra ko manjuuri na dekar party ke mansoobon par pani pher diya
 At a Malda rally on January 22, Shah said, "mamata didi feared that the final visit of the Trinamool government in the state would come out if our rath yatra came out
 ''hindu voton ko ekajute karne ke liye shah hi nahin, malda main manch se sabhi netaaon ne ek swar se bangladesh se hone vaali ghuspaith, vahaan se sharnaarthi bane gaiyr-musalamaanon kii naagarikta kaa mudda uthaaya
 Shah clearly said, "durga Puja immersion will not be allowed here, will the immersion be done in Pakistan?" Is trying to emotional bhaajapa kii bengal main chautarafa ranneeti main se pehali he alag-thalag pade voton ko apane paksh main karnaa
 For this, the BJP is fielding its star campaigners
 modi or shah ke alaava, rajnath singh, yogi adityanath or shivaraj singh chouhan agle do maheenon main soobe kii 32 siton par 100 se adhik sabhaayen karne vaale hai
 The party has planned a total of 300 meetings till the Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh jaiprakash majumdaar kehete hai, ''modi ji is baat kii taraf dhyaan dilaayenge ki kaise is tarah ke (vipaksh ke) avasarwaadi gathbandhanon kii vajah se sarkarein girti rahi hai or baar-baar chunaav karaane pade
 "clearly, the BJP is trying to bring anti-mamata votes into a court
" bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik, vam morcha ne jin 34 loksabhaa siton par duusare paaydaan par rahakar kam se kam 3 lakh vot hasil kiye the, un par mamata virdohi voton ko vah apane paale main kar legi
 To strengthen its penetration in the state, the BJP is making Bengal's symbol men a part of its election campaign
 malda main juty baari bheed ke saamne shah kehete hai, ''mamata ne jab brigade ground kii raily kii, to kisi ne bharat mata kii jai yaa vande maataram kaa naaraa nahin lagaaya
 Apart from Modi, he is not thinking anything now
 ''yah mahaj sanyog nahin tha ki shah kii raily main manch par subhaashachandr bose kaa bada-sa katout maujuud tha or shah ne apane bhaashan main na sirf netaji bose, balki swami vivekanand, rabindranath tagore, ramakrishna paramhans, bankimchand chattopadhyaay , shyama prasad mukherjee, batukeshwar dutt or suryasen kaa kai baar zikr kiya
 Now the BJP is preparing for Modi's four rallies in different parts of the state before the election is declared
 inamen se pehali 8 farvari ko kolkata main honi thi, lekin mamata kii vishaal raily ke baad ise kuch dinon ke liye sthagit kar diya gaya he
 Now the BJP wants to prepare to show a huge crowd in its rally
 bhaajapa ab mamata par puri tarah hamalavar ho sakati he kyonki ab use jiesti par samarthan kii aas main naram rukh apnaane kii koi majaburi nahin he
 Mamta has also become very alert due to aggressive attitude of BJP
 unhone trinmul ke netaaon ko apane-apane nirvachan kshetron main bane rahane ke nirdesh jari kar die hai
 Mamta said, "whenever BJP spreads lies, you should immediately oppose it
" '' lekin shaayad itnaa hi kaaphi nahin tha
 Mamta has also taken other measures
 2 farvari ko uttari 24 pargana ke thakurnagar main hone vaali modi kii raily kii jagah pehle se trinmul ke netaa ne book kara lee
 On January 29, Shah's rally in East Midnapore was to be held at a BJP supporter's farm
 par kathith rup se trinmul ke uksaane par padosi kisaan ne police main apane khet kharaab hone kii ashanka kii rapat likhaa di
 This led to apprehensions on Shah's rally till the night of 28 January
 23 janvari ko kendriya mantri smriti irani ko veerbhum ke suri main apni raily radd kerani padi kyonki mamata prashasan ne sarkari helipad par unka helicopter utaarne kii anumati nahin di
 The BJP, of course, sees a conspiracy in this
 pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh kehete hai, ''sarkaar ne 22 janvari kii shah kii raily main bhi yahi gandi raajnneeti kii
 Mamta's uneasiness is reflected in these steps
 bhaajapa jis tarah soobe main pair pasaar rahi he usase yah bechaini lajimi bhi he
 —with Romita Dutta *** desh kii pehali purnakalik mahila kendriya vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla aam bajet sansad main pesh kiya
 In his budget, Nirmala Sitharaman took special care of women along with all sections of the society
 bajet bhaashan main nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki mahilaon kaa vikaas kiye bina desh kii tarakkee nahin ho sakati he
 Calling 'nari Tu Narayani', Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the budget, announced that an overdraft facility of Rs 5000 will be provided to women holding Jan Dhan account
 saath hi mahilaon ke liye alag se ek lakh rupee ke mudra lone kii vyavastha kii jaaegi
 What will be the benefit for women? Since the coming of the Modi government in 2014, the work of opening bank accounts has been done under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 jis mahila kaa jandhan khaataa he, agar uske khate main ek bhi paisa na ho tab bhi wo usase paise nikaal sakati he
 Till now women could withdraw only 2 thousand rupees from their Jan Dhan account, which has now been increased to 5 thousand rupees
 ise hi overdraft kii suvidha kaha jaataa he
 On the other hand, this time, women will also be able to take advantage of the Modi government's first term Mudra scheme
 modi sarkaar kahati rahi he hi ki mudra lone kaa istemaal kar desh main bade str par rojgaar ke avasar paidaa hue hai
 Now presenting the first budget of the new government, Nirmala Sitharaman said that women will be able to take loans up to 1 lakh under this scheme
 haalanki, yah suvidha SHG se judi mahilaon se liye hoga

 supreme court main us vakt maahaul badal gaya jab ek maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe justise jees kehar ne yachikakarta ke haathon par lage laal rang par sawaal uthaaya
 Actually, the petition of Jai Mahabharata Party was going on in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main alag alag rajyon main party ne 25 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar khadey kiye
 But the Election Commission gave eight different election marks to the candidates, which caused a lot of trouble
 yachika main maang kii gai he ki chunaav ayog panjikaran ke vakt hi party ko chunaav chihn de de
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had also expressed its displeasure with the Election Commission and said that different election marks should not be given in this way and the Commission should take steps on its own or else the Supreme Court will issue an order for it
 somvaar ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan chunaav ayog ne kaha ki is disha main kaam kiya ja rahaa he or nattejey par pahunchane ke liye vakt lagegaa
 Justice Kehar said that the Election Commission should resolve it in 6 weeks
 isi dauraan apana paksh rakh rahe party ke adhyaksh vishwa mohan ke laal haathon ko dekhakar justise kehar ne poocha ki haathon par kya lagaaya gaya he
 The petitioner said that he worships Lakshmi
 jaj ne kaha ki aage se laal rang lagaakar court na aae kyonki ye rang unka dhyaan bhatkata he
 Meanwhile, Vishwa Mohan said that his party will form the government in the country in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is baat par justise kehar ne kaha ki peeche atarni general baithe hai or unhen aisi baaten acchhee nahin lagati
 Along with changing the character of the actor on the silver screen, his image in the public's mind often changes
 ‘khalanaayak’ se ‘munna bhai’ tak ke lambey safar main sanjay dutt ne bhi logon ke aise hi pyaar kaa swaad chakhaa
 But the emotion in the books of the law is not beating like this, so when the Supreme Court verdict came, today's hero finally turned out to be a 20-year-old villain
 53 varshiya sanjay dutt ko bhi aise hi faisle kaa andeshaa tha tabhi 21 march ko supreme court main aakhri sunwaayee se pehle unhone apane vakil satish maanscindia se kaha tha ki ve har tarah se adaalat ko samajhane kii koshish karen ki unka vyaktitv badal gaya he
 Cite his social service, his marriage and two children
 kehete to yahaan tak hai ki sanjay dutt ne kaha tha, ‘‘unase kahana ki mujh par raham karen
 'but Justice P
 es
 Satsivan and B
 es
 Chauhan's bench convicted him of possessing arms and ammunition under the Arms Act 1959 and sentenced him to five years imprisonment
 adaalat kaa kahana tha ki unke aparaadh kii paristhitiyaan or swaroop itane gambhir hai ki unhen yun hi nahin choda ja saktaa
 "perhaps his fate was in jail
" bhale hi naadaani main kiya ho lekin aparaadh to aparaadh he
 i am shocked by this
 ’’ abhinetri jaya pradaa ne puure ghatnakram par kuch is andaaj main pratikriya di
 Sanjay Dutt, 53, was found guilty of unlawfully possessing weapons in 2007, including those taken from terrorists involved in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts
 ke
 56 rifles included
 lekin tada ke tahat daayar mukademon kii sunwaayee ke liye gathit vishesh adaalat ne in dhamaakon kii sajeesh yaa inamen shaamil hone ke aarope se sanjay ko bari kar diya tha
 Anyway, TADA law is over now
 mumbai north central se congress saansad or sanjay dutt kii bahan priya dutt aakhri sunwaayee par supreme court main maujuud thim
 He was accompanied by MLA Krishna Hegde
 kehete hai, priya dutt ne congress party ko samajhane kii koshish kii thi ki bhai ke khilaaf kadaa rukh na apanaaya jaae
 Priya Dutt, passing through the journalists, just said in a low voice, "don't know what to say
" ’’dilli main desh kii sabase badi adaalat jab desh par hue pehle itane bade aatankwaadi hamale kaa aakhri faisla suna rahi thi, us samay sanjay dutt mumbai ke bandra main gyarahavin manzil ke apane flats main kismat ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Sanjay Dutt, who has spent 18 months in jail since 1993, will now have to remain in jail again for 42 months, while the Hindi film industry owes him around Rs 250 crore
 kaa daanv laga rakhaa he
 The court granted him four weeks' time to surrender
 faisla aane ke baad sanjay dutt ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘‘main faisle kii prati dekhuunga or kanoonee vikalpon par gaur kar rahaa hum
 i still have faith in the court, my family is with me and i am still strong
 ’’ sanjay dutt supreme court kii usee peeth ke chaumbar main sunwaayee kii punarvichaar yachika is aadhaar par daayar kar sakate hai ki record main sarsari taur par chook najar aati he
 If this method is not successful, they can petition the "curative" that the principles of spontaneous justice have been violated
 agar is yachika par vichaar hua to sweekruti ke liye supreme court ke liye teen sabase varisht nyayadhishon ko isaki prati di jaaegi
 However, the country's famous lawyer Ram Jethmalani believes, "the Supreme Court did nothing wrong with Sanjay Dutt
" ’’ balki sanjay ko to sajaa main ek saal kii riyaayat hi adaalat se mili he
 On the other hand, film director Mahesh Bhatt said in philosophical tone, "it was a happy moment for me when the court was giving its verdict on the biggest terrorist attack in the country, but in the middle when the sentence of Sanjay Dutt was sentenced
 So i was shocked
 ’’us daur kii yaad karte hue bhatta ne kaha, ‘‘uske paas ek aise daur main gan baraamad hui, jab desh aatankwaad ke bade hamale kaa saamana kar rahaa tha
 "in fact, it is impossible to molest any accused in the scale on which the 1993 bomb blasts rocked the country
" sochi-samajhi yojanadaalat ne aadesh diya he ki kaid ke dauraan sanjay dutt ko kisi film kii shooting karne kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 This is yet another setback for his up-and-coming career, supported in 2012 by films like Agneepath and Son of Sardar
 2013 main unka calendar shooting or filmon ke pramotion se bharaa hua he
 His films slated for release include Polisgiri, a remake of the 2003 Tamil hit Sami
 nirdeshak apurv lakhia kii remek zanjeer bhi adhar main he jisamen sanjay dutt puraani zanjeer ke pathan sher khan kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale the
 Actor Pran's role of Pathan is considered a milestone in the history of Hindi films
 lekin haathon main roomaal lekar masti main naachte sanjay dutt darshakon ke paas pahunchate usase pehle hi kanoon kaa paravaanaa unhen salaakhon ke peeche liye ja rahaa he
 Director Lakhia, who was involved in cutting the first trailer of the film, was not available to say anything
 policegiri 14 june ko relies honi he, uske baad rencil disilva kii ungali 6 sitambar ko relies hogi, jisamen sanjay dutt imran hashmi ke saath dikhenge
 But the third film of the popular Munna Bhai series Munna Bhai Chale Delhi is stuck now
 nirdeshak hiraani ne 2003 main munna bhai embibies or 2006 main lage raho munna bhai se sanjay dutt ko phir se bharosemand star bana diya tha
 He declined to say anything on the decision
 hiraani ne aamir khan or anoushka sharma kii 2014 main aane vaali film pike main bhi sanjay dutt ko shaamil kiya he
 Apart from this, Sanjay Dutt and his wife Manyata had a big plan to start their production house in 2013, which was planned for the remake of Amitabh Bachchan's 1982 hit Satte Pe Satta
 patrkaar se film produsar bane pritish nandi ne twitor par kaha, ‘‘duusari baar jail is aadmi ko tabah kar degi
 Supreme Court verdict on Mumbai blasts is good
 par haa, sanjay dutt meraa dost he
 i feel sorry for him
 vah apni bevakoofi kii sajaa bhugat rahaa he
 He is not a traitor
 usne ek galati kii or uski keemat chukaa rahaa he
 According to renowned lawyer Majid Memon, who has stood in the court on behalf of many accused in the Mumbai bomb blasts, the path of Sanjay's escape is now very difficult
 memon ne kaha, ‘‘ab unke paas badi peeth ke saamne jane yaa punarvichaar yachika daayar karne ke alaava koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 That too is possible only if a stay order is obtained from the court on today's order
 ab unhen jail janaa hi hoga
 Sanjay Dutt has often been accused of taking advantage of his political connections to escape from jail
 kehete hai ki 1995 main duusari baar giraftaar ke samay unke divangat pita congress saansad sunil dutt ne shivasena pramukh bal thakare se vaada kiya tha ki agar ve bete ko jamaanat dilaane main madad kar den to sunil dutt loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 It is also said that this is the reason why Narayan Athawale could easily win the Mumbai North Central seat in 1996
 2007 main jab tada adaalat ne sanjay dutt ko tada ke tahat gambhir aaropon se bari kiya or sirf kahin lacheele hathiyaar kanoon ke tahat doshi tehraaya to sibiai ne is faisle ko chunauti nahin di
 If convicted under TADA law, Sanjay could have been imprisoned for life
 lekin jo sajaa hui he use bhi 53 saal kii umr main kaatna aasaan nahin hoga
 The iron man of the film screen will need a steely heart and an inspiration of Gandhism to take the punishment

 is khaas baatcheet kii shuruyaat main ajtak ne ovaisi ne poocha ki bijepi ke paas rashtrawaad he, bharat mata kii jai he lekin aapke paas kya he? iske jawaab main asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha, 'hamaare paas baba bhim raav ambedkar kaa diya hua samvidhan he, jo in tamaam bijepi ke muddon se bada he
 Whoever has the constitution will have the greatest power
 isiilie jab main samvidhan kii baat karata hum to sangh parivaar, bijepi ke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin hota
 Asaduddin Owaisi was asked the next question that he does not remember the constitution at the time of elections and talks about beef biryani
 aisa kyon? iske jawaab main asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha, 'jab 2014 ke chunaav ho rahe the us vakt narendra modi chunaav prachaar main kah rahe the ki pakistan ke log bharat aae the jinhen hamane biryani khilaai
 i made such a statement to remind him of his jumla
 'asaduddin ovaisi ne pulavama hamale par bhi apni raay rakhi
 He said, 'BJP is in play now, issues are raised repeatedly to hide their weaknesses
 pulavama kaa jo hamalaa hua uski jimmedaari kis par jaati he
 We believe that Pakistan helped those people (terrorists) but why you (PM Modi) were silent
 itani badi taadaad main vahaan ardex kaise gaya
 Who is responsible for this? aapane kis mantri ko, kisi adhikari ko kyon nahin hataaya
 The government is yours in the country, the governor in Jammu and Kashmir is yours, so its political responsibility also falls on you but is not ready to take any action
 'asaduddin ovaisi par aksar bijepi kaa agenda chalaane kaa aarope lagata he
 On this, he said that we are not running anyone's agenda but are exposing BJP
 bijepi pulavama kii jimmedaari lene ke liye taiyaar isliye nahin ho rahi kyonki unhen maaloom he ki ve expoj ho jaaenge
 In response to the demand for evidence of the Pulwama attack and how many terrorists were killed in it, Asaduddin Owaisi said that 'there was an air strike against Pakistan'
 hamen aitraaj is baat kaa he ki kya rajnath singh sach bol rahe hai yaa bharat sarkaar ke videsh sachiv ne jo rakhaa wo sach he
 i believe that the stand given by the Foreign Secretary is true
 jo bhartiya vaayu sena ke pramukh ne kaha wo sach he
 The rest of Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Ahluwalia, Agriculture Minister are all trying to bake their political bread
 koi kahata he 250, koi kahata he 300, koi kahata he 150, ahaluwalia kehete hai ki maarna makasad nahin tha
 Therefore, they should be told about Pulwama that RDX reached them by mistake
 'asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki desh kaa mizaaj aisa ban gaya he ki agar narendra modi ke khilaaf kuch bolte hai to deshadrohi qaraar die jate hai
 Let's talk about going to Pakistan
 ye mizaaj hamen bardaasht nahin kyonki ham khilaaf main bolte rahe hai
 Thinking against Muslims has increased in the last five years
 is soch ko badalanaa padegaa
 It is not right to doubt Muslims again and again
 mulk main philhal sabase ahm mudda kya he, is sawaal ke jawaab main asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki naujavaanon ke liye rojgaar sabase bada mudda he
 The institutions of the country
 uski majbootee bhi kaaphi jaruri he
 When he associated Narendra Modi with Jumla Politics, he said about Rahul Gandhi that he is becoming a politician right now
 priyanka gandhi ke bare main ovaisi ne kaha ki ve unhen nahin jaanate kyonki abhi abhi raajnneeti main ai hai
 Regarding Nitin Gadkari, Owaisi said that he could lose the election due to infighting in his party in Nagpur
 loksabhaa chunaav prachaar apane antim charan main pahunch chukaa he or sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne saatven charan ke liye apni takat jhonk di he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is on a visit to Punjab on Monday, where he said at an election rally held in Khanna, Punjab that the justice scheme will create jobs in the country

 centre kii modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki narendra modi hindustan ke pradhanmantri bane or unhone desh ke yuvaaon ko har saal naukari dene kaa vaada kiya, lekin unke vaade kaa kya hua
 The 56-inch prime minister also promised that 15 lakh rupees would be added to people's accounts
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki nyaay yojana se badi sankhya main rojgaar banenge
 Within a year of coming to power, 2
2 million vacant posts will be filled soon
 yuvaaon ko panchayat ke jariye rojgaar die jaaenge
 He said, 'I challenged PM Modi to have an open debate
 mahaj 15 minute kii bahes main sab kuch saaf ho jayega
 i will do 4 questions today
 vah mere sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de sakenge
 But the Congress will tell the truth to the people
 'rahul gandhi ne notebandi ko lekar modi sarkaar ko gherte hue kaha ki notebandi ke faisle ne sabhi ko line main laakar khadaa kar diya
 People had to struggle for their money
 unhone vaada kiya tha ki kisaanon ko unke fasal kii acchhee keemat di jaaegi, lekin kya hua
 What happened to Make in India? bain taraf dekho to india, dayee taraf dekho to india, lekin sarkaar logon ko rojgaar dene main naakaam rahi
 Encouraging the government on debt waiver, Rahul Gandhi said that Narendra Modi did not waive the debt of a single farmer, but he forgave thousands of crores of rupees from 15 rich people
 jabaki ham garibon ko paisa dena chaahate hai

 iske baad jaisadigvijayne elaan kiya tha ki yatra puri karne ke baad wo koi pakora nahin talenge balki, khulkar raajnneeti karenge
 He also appeared
 ek taraf yatra kaa samaapan ho rahaa tha to duusari taraf manjar bataa rahaa tha ki, yahaan se digvijay kii bhavishya kii siyasat kaa armbh bhi ho rahaa he
 From the stage, all the stalwarts of Madhya Pradesh Congress started coming slowly and slowly among the saints on this religious platform of politics
 kamalnath, pradesh adhyaksh arun yadav, purv kendriya mantri or saansad kantilal bhuriya, rahul kii kareebi minakshi natarajan, varisht netaa suresh pachori, saansad or congress kii legal cell ke mukhiya vivek tankhaa samet rajya ke prabharee mahasachiv deepak baavariyaa bhi manch par baithe
 The stage was religious, so political talk did not happen, but there were bridges of praise of Digvijay on the tongue of every speaker
 diggaj kamalnath ne to ye tak kah diya ki digvijay mere bhai hai, main unako salaam karata hum
 He is our pride vahiin raajnneeti main kismat aajamaane kaa khwab sanjoye abhinayta ashutosh rana ne digvijay ko rajarshi bataa daalaa
 Rana said that Digvijay is a king, but after revolving around Narmada, he also became a sage
 isliye main unako rajarshi kahuunga
 Digvijay was showing his dominance in politics on the stage, only then what was going to happen in the politics of Madhya Pradesh Congress, he also got a glimpse of it
 aakhir manch par jyotiraditya sindhiya or satyavrath chaturvedi maujuud nahin the
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak soon after the conclusion of the program, Digvijay made his intentions in terms of the politics of the Center and the state
 gutbaji khatm karenge digvijaydigvijay singh ne kaha ki wo madhya pradesh ke siem pad kii daud main katai nahin hai, balki alaakaman kahegaa to wo rajya congress kii gutbaji, aapasi khinchataan or fasaad ko khatm kar sabko congress kii khatir ekajute karne ko taiyaar hai yani rajya congress kaa haal wo khud bayaan kar dete hai
 It is clear that Digvijay now wants to become a kingmaker, not a king of Madhya Pradesh Congress politics
 2003 main rajya main party ko haar ke baad siem rahe digvijay ne agle 10 saal chunaav nahin ladane or rajya kii siyasat main sidhaa dakhal nahin karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 After which he went to the Rajya Sabha elections in 2014 and became an MP
 ab unki nigahen phir rajya kii raajnneeti par hai, lekin chanakya yaa pitamah kii bhoomika main
 Along with the state, Digvijay's plan for the politics of the center is also ready
 party ke bheetar kii siyasat main apana dakhal badhaane kii chahat main wo phulpur or gorakhpur upachunaav main congress ke ladakar jamaanat nahin bachaa paane ke sawaal par wo khulkar kehete hai ki ye faisla unki samaj se pare tha, jisaki unhen jaankaree bhi nahin thi
 At the center of the party's stature, Digvijay wants his big stature in national politics rather than just taking charge of a state as general secretary
 isiilie wo kehete hai ki 14 saal mahasachiv rah liya, ab kitna kaam karuunga
 If Rahul changes me on the lines of Janardan Dwivedi, then i have no problem
 lekin digvijay yaheen nahin rukate
 He also adds that Rahul should take any decision for change, he is with him
 par rahul ko yuvaaon or anbhavi netaaon ke bich saamanjasy rakhana hoga
 Elections are due in Madhya Pradesh in November, during the Narmada Yatra, Digvijay has gone to about 114 seats in the state
 unke kareebi bataate hai ki, unka aglaa plan puure rajya kaa daura karnaa he
 Perhaps that's why Digvijay says that if the election is to be won, the state leaders will have to go among the people and listen to their minds
 digvijay ke karibiyon ke mutabik, wo rajya main kisi ko siem kaa cheharaa banane ke haq main nahin hai
 After all, it is with this bet that they want to become kingmakers
 lekin siyasat ke maahir khilaadi congress kii samskruti se bakhubi maahir hai
 That is why it is said that the politics of the state or the center or its political future, they will first discuss with the party president Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ko mili khuli chhotakentre kii siyasat ke lihaaj se wo amit shah or piem modi par tikhe hamale jari rakhte hai, jisase rashtriya raajnneeti main kad bada rahe
 At the same time, in the future, the Center advocates joining the Congress and the rest of the opposition parties, but saying that where the Congress is weak, there should be alliances
 vaise digvijay jaanate hai ki, ab party main bos sonia nahin rahul hai
 That is why, considering the comparison of Sonia and Rahul to be meaningless, they talk of giving Rahul a free hand
 aakhir main rahul ke bayaan ko aage badhaate hue phulpur-gorakhpur kaa hawala dete hue digvijay kehete hai ki, ranneeti sahi ho to modi ko banaras main or bijepi ko desh main haraaya ja saktaa he
 Overall, Digvijay could not play in the last series of politics
 isliye nae homework or apni siyasat ke keel kaante dobaaraa durast karke wo siyasat kii nai siries main utar rahe hai
 This time they flop or become the man of the series, it will have to be kept an eye on Digvijay's forward politics

 white bread or pasta khaane se aap depressant ke shikaar ho sakate hai, zyada maatra main carbohydrate aapke bheetar chidchidapan or chintaa badha saktaa he

 Initially the company kept it on default and because of this there was a ruckus about the privacy
 baad main company ne hameshaa kii tarah yujar welfare kii daleel dete hue ise opshanal bana diya
 However, this feature has flopped till now
 ye baat alag he ki fasebuk ne ab tak is feechar se na jane kitne yugers kaa phase data ikaitha kar liya hoga

 You might not need to write email and password after this feature comes

 This feature sounds strange, because Facebook does not design hardware
 agar aisa hua to is par ek baar se privesi ko lekar mark jakarberg sawaalon ke ghere main honge
 Because the face data of billions of users of Facebook will be directly with Facebook and this will obviously be a problem regarding privacy
 twit main jo screenshot share kiya gaya he usamen facial othentication register karne ke steps die gaye hai
 The first thing is to record a video selfie

 rafel saude ko lekar mache ghamaasan ke bich centre kii modi sarkaar ne apane bachaav main safai pesh kii he or kaha ki hamane court ko gumraah nahin kiya he, balki hamaari daleel ko court ne galat samajha
 The Center on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking an amendment to the apex court's decision on the Rafale fighter jet deal which contains references to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report and the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament
 
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki uske note kii alag-alag vyakhya ke kaaran vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 The Center has stated in its petition that paragraph 25 of the verdict appears to be based on a note that was deposited in a sealed envelope with a price statement but is being interpreted differently from the word used by the court
 centre ne saaf kar diya ki vah yah nahin kah rahaa ki kaig report kaa piesi ne pareekshan kiya tha yaa sampadit hisse ko sansad ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 He clarified that the note stated that the government had shared the price statement with the CAG
 yah vaakya bhootkaal (past tens) main likhaa gaya he or yah ‘‘tathyaatmak rup se sahi’’ he
 The petition states that the said note has been written in bold letters
 isamen mote aksharon main likhe gaye vaakya main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar mulya vivaranon ko kaig ke saath saajha kar chuki he
 PAC is examining the CAG report
 report kaa sampadit hissaa sansad main rakhaa gaya or yah sabake saamne he
 According to the petition, the word 'has been (has been)' used in the past, written about which the government has already shared the price details with the CAG
 yah bhootkaal main he or tathyaatmak rup se sahi he 
 The second part of the sentence deals with PAC
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kaig kii report kaa piesi pareekshan kar rahi he 
 In the judgment, 'has been' instead of 'is'
 centre ne sheersh adaalat ke aadesh main aavashyak sanshodhan kii maang karte hue kaha ki isi tarah faisle main yah kathan he ki report kaa sampadit hissaa sansad ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 It was said that the edited portion of the report was placed before Parliament and is public
 yachika ke mutabik, note main centre kii ore se yah kaha gaya he ki kaig report kaa piesi pareekshan kar rahi he
 It is an explanation of the process that is commonly adopted, but in English, "has been" means "has been" meaning "has already" in place of "is"
 sarkaar ne aise vakt yachika daayar kii he jab vipakshi congress or anya ne mudde par sawaal uthaae hai or sarkaar par kaig report ko lekar sheersh nyaayalay ko gumraah karne ke aarope lagaae hai
 Giving great relief to the Modi government, the Supreme Court on Friday said that it is "satisfied" with the decision-making process in the Rafale fighter jet deal
 sheersh adaalat ne jaanch kii maang khaarij kar di jiske baad is faisle ko lekar bhaajapa or congress ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 The Supreme Court said that it sees no reason to interfere in the "sensitive issue" of purchasing 36 aircraft from France
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party or congress samet tamaam vipakshi dalon ne rafel saude ke maamle main centre kii modi sarkaar par supreme court main jhooth bolne or court va sansad ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh has written a letter to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha demanding that the Attorney General be summoned to Parliament
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki rafel maamle main sarkaar ne sirf sansad hi nahin balki supreme court ko bhi gumraah karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 Kharge said - The government did not present the correct facts in the court
 a day after the Supreme Court gave its verdict in the Rafale case, Mallikajurn Kharge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said on Saturday that he was the Attorney General and Comptroller and Auditor General ( CAG) and will ask them when the CAG report was presented and when the PAC investigated it
 varisht congress netaa ne yahaan media se kaha ki sarkaar ne sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh sahi tathy pesh nahin kiye or adaalat main 'jhooth' bolaa he
 He said, 'the government showed there that the CAG report has been submitted and the PAC has examined it
