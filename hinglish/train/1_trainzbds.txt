 Lata Mangeshkar said, 'I felt as if the mountain had broken on my head after hearing the news of former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee's death
 kyonki main unako pita samaan maanati thi or unhone mujhe apni beti banaaya tha
 He further said, 'I loved him so much that i used to call him Dadda
 atalji ke bhaashan main sab sach hota tha
 He was a true and good man
 kabhi kisi kaa dil nahin dukhaaya
 '5
 chamatkaarik vyaktitvabaat 1957 kii he jab atal bihari vaajapeyi balrampur loksabhaa seat se 10 hajaar voton se jitkar pehali baar loksabhaa pahunche the
 Taking lessons from the previous defeat, in the 1962 general election, the Congress fielded Gandhian Shubhadra Joshi against her to defeat Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 donon hi bharat chodo andolan kaa hissaa rahe the, lekin vichaardhaara ke str par alag the
 The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was impressed by hearing the speech of young Atal for the first time reaching Parliament
 ve unhen bhavishya kaa pradhanmantri maanate the
 He considered Vajpayee a big threat to the Congress victory from Balrampur seat
 matadaataaon par apana prabhaav jamaane ke liye unhone shubhadra joshi ke paksh main lokrpriy film abhinayta balraj saahani se chunaav prachaar karaayaa
 As a result, Vajpayee lost the election
 samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii 80 main se '73 se zyada' siten jeetne ke bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke daawey par tanj kasate hue aaj kaha ki mahagathbandhan kii taiyaari maatr se ghabaraae bhagava dal ko yah mansuba bhul janaa chahie
 On the occasion of distribution of laptops to the meritorious students, Akhilesh told the reporters that the Samajwadi people are ready for the Lok Sabha elections and they will not reveal their strategy yet
 unhone bhaajapa ko naseehat dete hue kaha ve kehete hai ki 73 se zyada siten jeetenge, lekin unhen yah bhul janaa chahie or baat 70 plus kii kerani chahie kyonki upachunaav main teen siten to vah haar hi chuke hai
 Asked about the Grand Alliance, Akhilesh said, "discussions in the media about this grand alliance are in full swing, then the Grand Alliance is almost certain to happen
 jahaan tak upi kii baat he, to gathbandhan yahaan bhi hoga
 We have stolen what the BJP had created and now we are trying it on it
 'gauratlab he ki bhaajapa adhyakshmit shahne haal main chandauli main yojit raily main kaha tha ki bhaajapa agle loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh kii 80 main se 73 se bhi zyada siten jeetegi
 This figure will not be less than 73
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa or uske sahyogi apana dal ko kul 73 siten mili thim
 Former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav claimed that the people of the state have seen how the BJP betrayed him, how castes were entangled in the castes for political gains, how hatred was spread in the name of religion
 yadav ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav najadik aane par bhaajapa notebandi jaisi puraani baaten bhuulakar raksha galiyare jaisi nayi baaten kar rahi he
 Today, when common roads are not being built and bridges are not being allowed, how and when will this corridor be built? The SP President said that he would like to remind the BJP government of that promise by giving laptops to the meritorious students
 , Which he did in his election manifesto
 ham jo laptop de rahe hai, yah koi raajnneetik stant nahin he
 Today, laptops are needed by every child, that is why the SP government distributed laptops during his reign

 bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi bhi varanasi se ummidavaar he to is kshetra main sapa or basapa kii bhi majboot pakad he
 Let's know in a special conversation with Aaj Tak about what is in the heart of Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav regarding these elections
 
 
 
 
 sawaal -is umr main bhi kaaphi mehnat kar lete he
 The answer has to be taken, Samajwadi Party is at the forefront
 sawaal -modi kaa daawa he ki san 84 main congress ko jaisi safalataa mili thi is baar waisi safalataa bijepi ko milegi
 Answer - As far as Modi is concerned, it was initially thought that there is a good atmosphere
 lekin tab bhi aisa maahaul nahin tha jaisaa unka vichaar he upi or desh ke bare main
 That condition is no longer in UP
 aam janata main bhi kuch acha prabhaav tha wo ab nahin he
 Question - What is the reason behind this
 jawaab -vajah he ki duusari partiyaan ne bhi apni baat rakhi he
 There is tremendous dissatisfaction among the minorities about the incident that happened in Gujarat
 duusari baat ye ki choti-choti jatiyon main bante logon par modi kaa asar nahin he, badi jatiyon par modi kaa asar he
 Question: In western UP, bjp's publicity was quite high, there was wind in favor of BJP and Modi
 jawaab -mujffarnagar ke samaajawaadee voter hai vahaan ke musalmaan
 BJP tried to run hindu-muslims there but Muslims voted for the Samajwadi Party
 jab maine unase poocha, 'tumhaare saath to bahut atyaachaar hua, to unhone kaha ki atyaachaar to bahut jagah hua, lekin upi sarkaar ne hamaari acchhee or paryaapt madad kii he
 After counting the names of the Samajwadi Party government and the leaders who helped, tell us that we have been helped
 is vajah se samaajawaadee party ko mila he or doosraa jo hua he wo to bijepi ne karaayaa
 Question- Your opponents say that your party got rioted and Azam also has his hand
 jawaab -mujhe aashcharya is baat kaa he ki ajam sahab ko is ghatana kii jaankaree bhi nahin hui
 Azam Saheb came to know when the whole incident happened
 hamane unako telephone kiya, vastav main unako jaankaree nahin thi
 Then i said, let's go and you, then he said that we and you will definitely go
 lekin ghatana kii puri jaankaree kar lete hai, iske baad maukey par ajam gaye
 Question- Aajam is accused of making inflammatory speeches, due to which the Election Commission imposed a ban
 jawaab -ajam sahab ke saath pakshpaat hua he
 i do not expect this from constitutional institutions
 loktantr main puraa adhikaar or swatantraaa he bolne kii
 If there is a serious incident, then there is a right of action, but this Election Commission has done wrong and has done anti-constitutional work
 sawaal -aap raksha mantri bhi rahe hai or tamaam ilaakon main gaye bhi hai
 It is fair to say that the battle was won because of a particular class
 jawaab -unhone ek varg kii baat nahin kahi
 He said the right thing
 ek musalmaan tha jo ladaa or shahid hua or sahi he ki abdul hamid ne akele ladaai main jeet nahin dilaai
 If he had not jumped, what would have been the condition of the Indian army and what would have been the result of the fight? ham jab kah rahe hai to ellection kamishan kuch nahin kah rahaa he lekin ajam kehete hai to ellection kamishan ection letaa he
 This is what i want to ask that we are saying the same thing and saying it continuously and even today we have come to say it, so why not take action on us? sawaal -aapke or ajam ke tareekon main antar hoga
 Answer - Now find a way but we say the same thing
 sawaal -aapke bare main bhi aajkal kaha ja rahaa he jo pehle kaha jaataa tha
 Amit Shah has accused Maulana Mulayam, Samajwadi Party of capturing booths
 jawaab -amit shah kya kah rahe hai or amit shah kya hai?
 It would not be appropriate to speak anything about them
 ye sara desh jaanata he
 It is a strange situation that people like Amit Shah should be sent to UP after making election charge
 shah ko koun nahin jaanata ki amit shah ne kitne katleam karwaae hai
 i have seen the tyranny of Amit Shah with eyes
 ladakiyon or mahilaon par kiye gaye atyaachaar se meri ankhon main aansu aa gaye
 This had happened and now that Modi will become Prime Minister, what will happen to the country
 vaise wo banenge to nahin main kah saktaa hum
 Even if they are formed, they will not get majority
 bahumat nahin aa rahaa he unka ki 272 siten jeet rahe hai
 But even if a majority comes together, there are people sitting there that they will not get a chance
 sawaal -jaise koun baithe hai
 Answer - Now they will not tell, they all know that the candidate is someone else's prime minister
 sawaal -modi ke jo samarthak he korporate india ke wo kehete hai ki hamen ek aadmi chahie jo vikaas kaa kaam kare or jo taqatvar ho
 Answer - How many years has it been in Gujarat
 lekin kya kar diya vahaan
 See, the most unemployed youth is inside Gujarat
 vahaan ke log pani ko taras rahe hai
 Many districts have no water, what did they do
 isi tarah se 37 hajaar bacchiyon kaa pataa nahin he, pataa hi nahin he kahaan gaye main bol to rahaa hum roj
 Now they say that Mulayam Singh is doing our intelligence
 37 hajaar to laapata hai
 How many people are sick there, no medicine
 agar aspataal he to doctor nahin he
 This is the condition of Gujarat today and 21 districts do not even have drinking water
 sawaal -wo hawala dete hai ki krishi utpaadan vahaan 10 fisadi he jabaki puure desh main 3 fisadi he
 There is a road in the village and there is also internet
 jawaab -upi se wo gujarat kaa muqabla kar hi nahin sakate
 There is 8 hours of electricity in Gujarat
 naa sadakon ke bare main naa pani ke bare main naa vikaas ke bare main or naa bijli ke bare main
 There are big industrialists who are promoting this
 ye unki majaburi he
 The truth is that if you ever take a delegation, then you will see how many girls are missing
 bijli kitne ghante aati he
 What is development and for drinking water, even today, when i am speaking, 21 districts are not there
 jo bol rahaa hum sach bol rahaa hum or isliye modi sahab pareshaan hai ki mulaayam singh sach bol rahaa he
 Modi has done all this by lying
 6 bade udyogpati jo kharbapati hai wo chup hai
 He also has newspapers which Modi speaks of while he is printed in them
 wo dare hue hai ki hamen barvaad kar degaa so udyogpati chup hai or kai udyogpit to unke saath lag gaye
 Will not take name main jaanata hum persenalee unhone kam se kam 10 hajaar karod rupaya diya he
 Question- Do you believe that there is a Modi distinction to deny outright
 jawaab -modi sahab ne jo bhi gujarat main vikaas kii baat kahi he wo bilkul galat he or upi ke baraabar nahin he
 For 8 hours electricity comes there and it is said that they are giving full electricity
 pataa nahin kyon jhooth bol rahe hai sab log or jhooth ko sahi maan rahe hai
 Question - But most people believe that Modi is a powerful leader
 jawaab -kaahe kii takat, kushti ladenge kya
 
 56 inch kii baat karte hai unhen hamaare bare main pataa he
 When you were tortured and oppressed, you did not see how many inches of chest
 mujhe ahmedabad aane se ye kahkar roka tha ki aap agar aa rahe to aapaki jaan chali jaae to main jimmedaar nahin hum
 SP stopped me but i did not stop
 
 
 maine kaha mujhe giraftaar karo, mujhe jail main daal do yaa goli maar do
 Question - Due to the failures of the previous government, people are holding hopes from Modi
 jawaab - desh main mahangaai he lekin gujarat main mahangaai upi se zyada he
 i am telling this thing to Modi sir through you that there is more inflation, i do not know why lies are being propagated everywhere
 sawaal-aap jo kah rahe hai to bijepi ke to number aaenge nahin to kya congress kaa koi chance he
 Answer - It is true that there is a resentment from the Congress
 pichley 10 saal main congress ne janata ke liye koi aisa kaam nahin kiya hai
 So that he can say that we have done this work
 congress se naaraaz hone kii vajah se uskaa laabh bijepi ko mil saktaa he thodaa bahut
 But they will not get that benefit alone
 tamaam dal hai jinhen laabh milegaa
 He did not say anything in the Lok Sabha even when China is attacking
 maine adwani ji se bhi bolaa, kuch to bolie
 Countries talk of devotion but Advani did not speak even on my appeal when China was occupying
 sawaal -har pita kaa ek sapana hota he or aapkaa ek sapana saakaar ho gaya
 But the dream of Samajwadi Party people is to see Netaji as PM
 jawaab -wo to main nahin kah saktaa lekin hamaare kaaryakarta kaaphi mehnat kar rahe hai
 You will understand when you see our meetings
 janata kaa rujhaan to samaajawaadee party kii taraf he
 The party does what it says
 jo bhi vaayada kiya tha wo hamaari sarkaar ne puraa kiya he
 Hope is gathered from the crowd that is happening
 hamane janata se yahi kaha he ki hamen takat do
 Question- If it comes to the third front, then you have to take support from outside
 jawaab -ham ye chaahate hai ki tisare morche kii sarkaar bane
 Because the public is angry with Congress and BJP
 bijepi ne pehle bhi sarkaar chalaaya he or koi chamatkaari kaam nahin kiya he
 But the Deve Gowda or Gujral government of the Third Front did a lot of work with the truth
 seat nahin aane par dekhenge
 It is not said that we will not support from outside, not that we will not join the government
 congress ke kai leader kah chuke hai ki ham baahar se sirf samarthan nahin denge, matlab he ki ham bhi shaamil ho jaaen

 karan kehete hai 'pichley do saal main aalia ne kai acchhee filmon main kaam kiya he
 i apologize for the film 'fantastic'
 iske alaava, '2 stats' or 'hampti sharma kii dulhaniyaan' or ab 'kapur and sans' ko box offis par acchhee pratikriya mil rahi he
 Alia is the proud girl of Dharma Productions
 ' Karan, the producer of the recently released film Kapoor & Sons, said, 'when i launched Alia Bhatt and Siddharth Malhotra in the first film, i didn't think i would see them on screen
 maine jab aalia ko 'haive' main dekha to ronaa aa gaya
 i could not believe that she had gone so far as an artist

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's media advisor has now come to his rescue
 unka kahana he ki pradhanmantri khub bole, unhone kaaphi kaam kiya or unke samay main desh main tarakkee hui
 In support of these things, he came down with figures
 inke jariye unhone yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki jaisaa dikhataa he, vaisaa sach nahin he
 He called Manmohan Singh a 'development man'
 lekin in baton par shaayad media ne khaas dhyaan nahin diya, kyonki aankade chhalte hai or kai baar jhooth kaa ek madhyam hote hai
 If the advice of the media advisor is accepted, then Manmohan Singh gave around 1200 speeches
 ab sawaal he ki itane saare spich kisne suna or unka kya asar hua? unki awaz dur-dur tak kyon nahin gunji?agar unhone gaanvon or kisaanon kii bhalaai ke bade kaam kiye, to unhen shaabaasi kyon nahin mili? unke samay main vikaas hua, to uski charchaa aaj kyon nahin ho rahi he? sansad main kai aise maukey aae jab vah bol sakate the, lekin vah bole nahin
 He got a chance to speak from the ramparts of the Red Fort many times, then what did he say there? Many such questions arise in Zehn
 aakhir yah vahi manmohan singh to hai, jinke aarthik sudhaaron se desh kii janata mohit hui thi or unki jai-jayakaar hui thi
 This is the same Manmohan Singh whose people cheered when he became Prime Minister

 It cannot be said to be great by giving statistics and figures should also be used to deceive people

 Today Manmohan Singh is being attacked and his party is silent
 unki saakh par batta lag gaya, to unhen khud hi bachaav main aana pad rahaa he
 All this is sad, because Manmohan Singh is credited with many achievements of the country
 unhone jo kuch kamaaya tha, vah sab apni chuppi se ganvaa diya, kyonki maun rahanaa hameshaa faldaayak nahin hota he, kabhi-kabhi yah kaaphi kshtdaayak hota he

 This decision of the Supreme Court has brought great relief to the Central Government
 saamaanya varg ke logon 10 fisadi aarthik aadhaar par die aarakshan kii adhisuchana par roak lagane se supreme court ne inkaar kar diya he

 During the hearing in the Supreme Court, senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan had described the 50% limit as part of the basic structure of the Constitution

 "the police of 12 countries are waiting for Don, but it is not impossible to catch Don"
 ye dialog ek hindi film kaa he
 After Gurmeet Ram Rahim went to jail, when his close Honeypreet absconded, some similar stories were being made about him
 magar 'ajtak' ne puri script hi badal daali
 Aajtak's reporter showed that, which even the police of seven states did not do
 ajtak ne haniprit ko talash kar usase har us sawaal kaa jawaab le liya, jo sirf paheli bane hue the
 But some questions still remain
 haniprit ne intervyuu main kaha he ki baba ke jail jane ke baad wo depressant main chali gai thi
 He said that he had no idea that the special CBI court of Panchkula on 25 August would consider Baba Ram Rahim guilty of rape
 us din ke baad se hi haniprit duniya kii najaron se ojhal ho gai thi or wo ab tak police kii giraft se baahar he
 But was Honeypreet really a victim of depression or was she waiting for the right opportunity to escape from the legal gripes
 darasal, gurmeet ram rahim jaise hi jail gaya uske baad har din nae khulaase hote rahe
 Baba's blog of black exploits went on in front of the world
 is dauraan haniprit apane thikaane badalati rahi
 Sometimes she stayed at her devotee's house, sometimes took shelter of her brother-in-law
 ek taraf haniprit police kii pakad se dur rahi or duusari taraf police-prashasan sirsa dere se lekar baba ke duusare thikaanon par chhapemari karata rahaa
 In Panchkula, the people who instigated the violence kept tightening the screws
 lekin jaise hi ye maamla kuch shant hua,haniprit dilli pahunch gai
 On 25 September Honeypreet was claimed to be in Delhi
 wo lajpat nagar main apane vakil se milane ai or dilli hai court main agrim jamaanat yachika daayar kii
 However, the High Court dismissed Honeypreet's plea
 hai court ne saaf lafjon main haniprit ko sarender karne kaa aadesh de diya
 Now when Honeypreet has no choice but to go to the punjab-haryana High Court, she came in front of the media
 ajtak ko die intervyuu main bhi haniprit ne hai court main jane kii baat kaa zikr kiya

 It is worth noting that Ashok Tanwar, former president of the Congress unit of Haryana, has decided to put full emphasis on the defeat of the Congress in the state assembly elections on October 21 after leaving the party
 
 unki yojana har nirvachan kshetra main kisi bhi party ke pratyaashee, yahaan tak ki nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko bhi samarthan dene kii he, taaki congress ko haraaya ja sake

 This is the reason why his presence always makes him feel special

 In fact, the Supreme Court had recently withdrawn the exemption from arrest by granting seven days of anticipatory bail to Rajiv Kumar, close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 yah avadhi 24 may ko khatm ho rahi he
 Thus, if Rajiv Kumar does not get anticipatory bail from the competent court, then the CBI can arrest him

 During his century innings, Kohli got one and Rahane got two lives, but he was not deterred by this and continued to strengthen the team
 kohli or rahane ne apane desh ke liye aitihaasik emsiji par chauthe wicket ke liye pehali or record shatkeey saajhedaari ko anjaam diya
 a record partnership of 262 runs between Kohli and Rahane, India has played a total of 12 Test matches at this ground so far but before that the batsmen could not make a century partnership for the fourth wicket on a single occasion
 kohli or rahane ne haalanki is myth ko todate hue 262 ranon kii saajhedaari ko anjaam diya he
 The special thing is that this partnership between Kohli, who scored a third century in the current four-match series and Rahane, who scored a third century on foreign soil this year, was very aggressive as both scored at an average of more than four
 in donon ne is maidan par bharat ke liye kisi bhi wicket ke liye sabase badi saajhedaari ko anjaam diya he
 Not only this, both of them have made the biggest partnership for India outside Asia in the last 10 years

 There are many reasons for Lalu Yadav's concern
 saal 1997 main unhone janata dal ko todakar 17 saansadon ke saath rajd kaa gathan kiya tha
 This is the first Lok Sabha election since the party failed to win a single seat in Bihar
 vidambnaa ki rajya kii 243 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main 81 vidhayakon ke saath rajd ab bhi bihar kii sabase badi party he
 May be this status is not maintained for a very long time
 loksabhaa chunaav ke voting pattern se pataa chalata he ki vidhansabha main rajd kii aguai main mahagathbandhan ko hasil 81 siton main se 63 siton main bhi vah endie se peeche chalaa gaya he
 These include Mahua, which is the constituency of Lalu Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav

 nitish kumaar ke mahagathbandhan chhodkar jane ke baad se hi hamen pataa tha ki endie saamaajik taur par kitna majboot he

 isse nikalne kaa rasta yahi tha ki ham duusare saamaajik dhadon or khaskar aarthik taur par pichde virgon (ibisi) ke nae netaaon ko taqatvar banaaen
 Instead, the party entrusted this responsibility to external leaders like Mukesh Sahni, Jeetan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha

 Two EBC candidates of BJP also won

 In contrast, the JD (U) still has two EBC leaders in the upper house (ramnath Thakur and R
K

 The yadav-muslim base of the RJD (30 per cent of the total votes) has failed to stop Nitish Kumar in the elections, as the Chief Minister has established a strong nexus between the EBC and Mahadalit votes

 In such a situation, in front of Tejashwi and RJD, a very difficult challenge of the next year's assembly elections is on the face

 piem ko janmapatri nikaalnaa pasand he: rahulrahul gandhi se poocha gaya ki modi ne congress netaaon ko chup rahane ko kaha he kyonki unke paas sabakijanmapatrihe isapar wo kya jawaab dena chahenge? jawaab main rahul ne kaha ki piem modi ko jo karnaa he wo karen
 Who has refused to remove the horoscope, but do all this in his spare time because he likes to peek in the bathroom of others, spend time on Google, remove the horoscope, but take out the promises he made to the public
 gauratlab he ki piem ne sansad main manmohan singh par kataaksh kiya tha ki doctor sahab ko bathroom main bhi renkot pahanakar nahaana aata he
 Apart from this, in the meeting of Uttarakhand, Modi said that if you check on Google, then most of the jokes are found only on the Congress leader (rahul Gandhi)
 'modiji ko javaanon kii chintaa nahin'rahul ne kaha ki har saal do karod logon ko rojgaar kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin sirf ek lakh rojgaar hi de paae
 But on the other hand, loan of one lakh 40 thousand crores was waived for only 50 families
 kashmir main jawan mar rahe hai lekin modi ji ko google karnaa, janmapatri dekhnaa, logon ke bathroom main jhaankna acha lagata he
 Rahul asked what Modi ji has done for the people of UP in the last two and a half years
 kya rojgaar diya, kya kisaanon kii madad kii, nahin kii
 They just put people in line
 koi sootboot vaala line main nahin laga lekin garib aadmi kii jeb main padaa rupaya kaagaj ho gaya
 Whatsapp has increased the trouble of many people with features like blue tick and double tick
 pehle kisi bhi chating ap yaa google tok par aab kis se baat kar rahe hai online hai yaa nahin kisi duusare ko pataa nahin chalata tha
 But in this app, as soon as you are online, all your contacts come to know that you have used whatsapp
 whatsap main logout ke opshan naa hone kii vajah se yah hameshaa on rahata he or internet se conect hote hi notifications aapke mobile ko kai baar hang bhi kar dete hai
 We tell you some ways by which you can stay invisible by closing unwanted whatsapp notifications and calls
 aise karen whatsap last seen hydais feechar yujakarne ke phaayde bhi hai or nuksaan bhi
 The advantage is that no one will be able to see your last scene
 yani kisi ko yah pataa nahin chalegaa ki aapane whatsap kab kholaa tha
 The disadvantage is that you will not be able to see the last scene of anyone else
 agar phir bhi aap ise hide karnaa chaahate hai to whatsap ke settings main ja kar privesi teb main se last seen opshan ko Nobody kar den
 In this way, if you want to hide your whatsapp status then go to the settings, here you will find the privacy tab where click on the status and Nobody
 ab aapkaa status kisi ko nahin dikhegaa
 In such a way that the profile photo is wanted, if people do not see your profile photo, then go to the settings for it and select the profile photo in the Privacy tab and Nobody
 ab aapaki profile photo bhi koi nahin dekh saktaa
 How to turn blue tick off-line tick is causing many problems
 iskaa matlab aapane kisi ke bheje gaye massej ko pard liya he
 To hide this, go to the privacy option of whatsapp account where you will get the option of 'read Receipts'
 ise anchek kar den
 After this, you will read someone's message, yet there will be no blue tick
 par iskaa nuksaan bhi he aapako bhi yah nahin pataa chalegaa ki aapkaa massej kisi ne padhaa he yaa nahin
 There is no logout option in whatsapp Force stopwhatsapp but still you do not want this app to interfere in your life for a while, then you can force stop it
 iske liye android yugers apane mobile ke settings main jaakar ap opshan se whatsap ko force stop kar den
 After this, neither whatsapp nor notifications will be able to call on it
 jab aapako whatsap kii talab ho to aap whatsap open karen phir aap pehle jaise whatsap yuj kar paaenge

 ' punjab ke jalandhar main padhane aae ek africa chaatr kii berahami se pitayee kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The student from the African country of Burundi was beaten three months ago by some people after which he went into a coma and is hospitalized in Patiala
 use kuch samay se ventilator par bhi rakhaa gaya he
 It is being told that there was a fight between some local boys and students over something in which the African student suffered a major head injury
 jalandhar police ne is maamle main do logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 On the other hand, the student's father says that he wrote a letter twice to Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal for help but did not get any response

 rajyasabha main guuruuvaar ko real estate bill paas ho gaya he
 There are many such provisions in the bill, which is expected to prevent arbitrariness of builders
 yani sidhaa phayda graahak yani hamako-aapako milegaa
 But the special thing is that it will take about six months for the bill to come to the surface from the House, while during this time the market will see many big effects in view of the bill
 'india today' hindi patrika ke sampadak or aarthik visheshgy anshuman tiwari kehete hai ki aane vaale chah maheenon memrial estate kii duniyabadalane vaali he
 Its consumers will not only benefit, but the industry will also get growth
 ve kehete hai-1) contract main hoga badlaav, badalengi shartenrial estate bill ke aane se pehle bilders kii koshish rahegi ki vah graahakon ke saath apane contracts main har us cheez ko badal den, taaki maamla regulator tak na pahunche
 Obviously the conditions will change in this order and transparency will increase in this direction
 iskaa laabh sidhe taur par graahak ko milane vaala he
 2) Beneficial for builders Even till now there is no clear framework in the real estate market because of the arbitrariness of the builders
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki real estate bill ke aane se bilders main bhi bazaar ke niyamon ko lekar spashtataa aegi
 Simply put, he will know what to do and what not to do
 haa, is kaaran unhen apane puure bijness model ko phir se taiyaar karnaa hoga
 3) Offloading of houses will be the first effort of the builders to sell the houses already built as soon as possible
 yani makaanon kii ofloding shuru hogi
 The number of houses built in the market will increase and due to having more houses, the customers who are planning to buy houses now will get the benefit
 4) mandi kaa daur, ghategi keemtengale chah maheene main bazaar main adhik se adhik makaan bechney par jor rahegaa
 This is a period of recession, due to this, there can be a tremendous reduction in house prices
 yani paas main paisa he to makaan kharidne kaa isse behatar samay nahin milane vaala
 5) Emphasis on position where it is late, this time is going to be beneficial for those who have not received the position in time
 kyonki bilders yahi chahenge ki regulator ke aane se pehle aise saare maamle nipta die jaaen or kanoonee pacharon main funsane se bachaa jaae
 The social media site Twitter is now going to give a big feature to its users

 This will be possible because the company has bought video sharing and editing platform snapptv

 This technique makes it instantly visible on Twitter and other social media

 Breaking news can also be shown immediately

 Twitter's director product management Baljit Singh said that Twitter is investing a lot in video
 isliye hamaare liye yah jaruri ho gaya tha ki ham tivi broadcast karne waalon, bijness or event prodyucers ko hai quality video share karne kaa mauka den
 snapptv said that with Twitter we will maintain an open platform for live coverage

 Twitter has been putting more emphasis on videos and photos for some time

 agle saal loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 Opposition parties are trying to unite against the National Democratic Alliance
 samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyakikhilesh yadavane 6 janvari ko ek meeting kii
 All the opposition parties were invited to this meeting
 mudda tha, iviem kii bajaae ballat paper se chunaav karwaae jaaen
 But sources believe this issue was only an excuse
 is mudde ko aadhaar banaakar sabhi dalon ko ekajute karne kii koshish karnaa tha
 However, the BSP kept itself away from this opportunity
 haalanki abhi yah tay nahin he ki agar gathbandhan bana to koun-koun se dal iskaa hissaa banenge
 But the fragrance of the alliance is starting to pick up
 aise main agar gathbandhan bana to kuch phaayde honge to chunautiyaan bhi kam nahin
 Based on the previous report card, how much will the parties benefit and what will be the challenges? 21 in Samajwadi Party Legislative Assembly election
 8 pratishat vot paakar 47 siten hi jeet saki
 It was second in 31 seats, winning five seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 22
 5 percent votes were received
 phayda: basapa ke saath gathbandhan hone par dalit-yadav-muslim matadaataaon kii tikdi jitau sabit ho sakati he
 Challenge: In the event of an alliance, there is a possibility of polarization from the BJP in non-muslim votes
 siton par fansega pech
 22 in the BSP Legislative Assembly election
 2 pratishtvot paakar keval 19 siten hi jiti
 In 2014 Lok Sabha elections, despite being second in 35 seats, could not win a single seat
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 19
 8 percent votes were received
 phayda: gathbandhan hone kii dasha main agle loksabhaa chunaav main vot pratishat badaae ke saath kai siten jeetne kii sambhaavna
 Advantage status in eastern UP
 chunauti: party ke sheersh netaa sapa ke saath gathbandhan ke virdohi
 Skeptics on seat coordination and acceptance of Mayawati as the leader of the coalition
 congressspa ke saath gathbandhan kar lade vidhansabha chunaav main 6
 Won only seven seats with 2 percent of the vote
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 7
 Only Amethi and Rae Bareli seats won 4 percent of the votes
 chah siton par hi duusare number par thi
 Advantage: The seats increased due to the solidarity of anti-bjp votes when it was able to form a grand alliance with SP and BSP
 chunauti: pichley chunaavon main gathbandhan se bahut laabh nahin mila
 The top leaders of the state are not in favor of any kind of alliance

 *** Advocate and Anna Hazare party member Prashant Bhushan on Wednesday alleged that right-wing group Sriram Sena was responsible for the attack on him
 unhone maang kii ki is sanghathan par pratibandh lagaaya jaae or uskaa saamaajik bahishkaar kiya jaae
 Bhushan said, this is an organization which needs to boycott socially and the government should ban it
 is tarah ke sanghathan ko kanoonee rup se astitv main rahane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 He said, the Shriram army is known for attacking its hooligans and unarmed people without provocation
 unki ek chhap he jo unhone bangalore main chodi thi jab unhone restraan or pub ke baahar kai yuvak-yuvatiyon ko peeta tha
 They are known to beat girls wearing skirts
 khud par hamale kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki teen yuvakon kaa ek samooh aayaa, jisamen se ek ne khud ko isi sanghathan kaa pramukh bataaya
 The three entered his chamber and hit him with punches and sticks
 unhone kaha, ve kashmir ke bare main kuch kah rahe the, lekin unhone mujhase kisi baat par charchaa karne tak kii jahamat nahin uthaayi
 Bhushan said that the youth arrested has been identified as Inderveer, who describes himself as the state president of the Sri Ram Sena
 apane samarthakon or shubhachintakon se shriram sena ke kisi sadsy ke khilaaf hinsa nahin karne kii apil karte hue unhone kaha ki hinsa kaa jawaab hinsa nahin he
 He said, legal action will be taken against these people
 unamem se ek ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 
 
 There will be legal action but certainly no violence against the members of the organization
 sanghathan ke taur-tareekon kii tulana germany ke hitler se karte hue unhone kaha ki is tarah ke tatwon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai honi chahie
 He said that Hitler's soldiers on the storm in Germany used to go out and beat every person who did not agree with them
 is tarah ke logon ko roka janaa chahie
 Earlier in the day, lawyer Prashant Bhushan, a member of Anna Hazare's core team, entered the Supreme Court chamber and thrashed him strongly
 ek hamalavar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he, tathaa prashanth bhushan ko jaanch ke liye aspataal le jaaya gaya he
 The names of the three attackers are Indra Verma, Arun Kumar and Tejindra Pal Singh
 inamen se pakade gaye yuvak indra verma ne kaha ki usne kashmir ke mudde par die bhushan ke bayaan se naaraaz the
 According to sources, Prashant Bhushan said that the attack was due to his statement on the Kashmir issue
 prashanth bhushan hamalaa karne waalon kii anna hajaare ne kadi ninda kii he
 They say that they should not do such work with the law in hand
 anna ne kaha ki vah prarthana karenge ki aise yuvakon ko bhagwaan sadbuddhi de
 Anna said that he will negotiate and find out the reasons behind this attack and after that he will formulate further strategy
 gauratlab he ki prashanth bhushan se kuch samay purv kashmir main refrandam ke jariye yah pataa lagane kii vakaalat kii thi ki vahaan ke log jahaan janaa chahen unhen vahaan jane diya jaae
 (also from input language) bachchan sahab to kah gaye ki jisaki bivi moti uskaa bhi bada naam he
 But the boys are poor confuse whether the fat girl will be right for them or not
 bura na maniye, ham kisi par fabtiyaan nahin kas rahe
 But tell you some advantages and disadvantages of fat wife: Disadvantages: 1
 public main aap use sabase milwate hue sharmaate hai
 Now believe it or not, but if your wife is fat, then you hesitate to open your friend's circle or social party
 2
 One has to talk thoughtfully
 samay or kismat kaa kya pataa kis baat kaa bura maan jaae
 It is heard that fat girls are very sensitive
 3
 Big car is required
 agar bivi moti ho to dopahiyaa par zyada lambey samay tak chalanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 So the cost of the car increases but if the budget is of small car, then you may have to take a big car, given the size of the wife
 4
 If wife is thick then she will also be lazy
 ab aalsee bivi hone se kya kya nuksaan ho sakate hai ye aap khud sochie
 You may have to do all the work from washing utensils and clothes till the doorbell opens
 5
 Will have to buy strong furniture
 halkaa yaa sasta furniture tik paaegaa isaki koi guarantee nahin
 Advantages 
 
 1
 Fat wife is not selective about clothes
 yahaan aap chaiyn kii saans le sakate hai
 They will understand what will suit their figure
 unki shopping or kharch bhi aapako shaayad dukhi na karen
 2
 agar aap khaane ke shaukeen hai to aapaki moti bivi khaane ke liye aapako tokati nahi he
 On the contrary, he himself will give you company
 3
 Figure is the best friend for girls
 wo apane pati se zyada shishe ke saath samay bitaati hai
 But it is also not a problem with a fat wife
 wo aapako bharpoor time degi
 4
 kehete hai garlfriend ho yaa bivi, ladke hameshaa unke liye bodyguard kaa kaam bhi karte hai
 But a fat wife will be your bodyguard
 5
 Possibility about your partner or the fear of losing it hurts a lot
 lekin bivi moti hogi to aapako ye dar bhi nahin rahegaa
 Now we have given your suggestion
 faisla aapako lenaa he
 Well, there is no need to take these things to heart because the word fat or thin does not matter in itself, it is dependent on comparison

 The pressure of the Pakistani government on the Pakistani government is clearly visible
 magar ab imran khan kii in dhamkiyon kaa bhi zyaada asar padane vaala nahin he
 Because the way Pakistan got the answer to Pulwama in Balakot
 uske baad imran khan bhi phoonk phoonk kar kadam rakh rahe hai or baar baar yahi duhai de rahe hai ki jang se kuch hasil hone vaala nahin hai
 But in the Pakistan whose politics starts from Kashmir and ends on Kashmir, there is a compulsion of the government to show attitude on this issue
 imran khan ne pakistani sansad main kaha "inhone phir aaazaad kashmir main kuch karnaa he
 Result will come
 inhone ection lenaa he
 It cannot be an attack in Pakistan and we do not respond
 wo bhi jawaab denge
 We will also answer
 kanvension war hogi to kya hoga
 War can also go against us
 agar hamaare khilaaf gai to ham kya karenge
 We will have two paths
 ek bahadur shah jafar or doosraa tipu sultan kaa
 Accept one defeat or the other fight like Tipu Sultan to the last gorge of blood
 main ye sawaal poochta hum khun ke aakhri katare par ladenge to wo koun si jang hogi
 "now it can be like Raddemal, Imran Khan Pulwama attack
 kul milakar pakistani pradhanmantri dhara 370 khatm kiye jane ke jawaab main bharat ko aatanki hamale kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 At the same time, Imran Khan even said that this step of India will worsen the situation in Kashmir
 or mumkin he ki halaat yuddh jaise ban jaaen
 And if that happens, it will affect the whole world
 anuchhed-370 par bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav har guzarate din ke saath badhata ja rahaa he
 Stung by this decision of the Government of India, Pakistan and PM Imran, who were completely surrounded in their own parliament on this issue, held a meeting of the National Security Committee, or NSC, amid this emergency situation
 jisamen pakistani sena ke teenon pramukh maujuud the
 According to reports, all possible options were discussed in this meeting to counter India's move
 or ye tay kiya gaya ki pakistan sarkaar bharat ke kadam ke khilaaf kootnithik hamalaa karegaa
 Imran Khan gave these open threats to India in the Emergency session of the Pakistani Parliament called on Tuesday
 jahaan imran khan ne daawa kiya ki unhen bishkek sammelan ke dauraan hi kashmir main kisi anhoni kaa andaja ho gaya tha
 Imran Khan's difficulty is that he has to delay his country in Kashmir over the abolition of Article 370
 saath hi unhen dar is baat kaa bhi sata rahaa he ki kal ko agar bharat ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir par ection le liya to pakistan ke paas kya rasta bachegaa
 One of the major reasons for Imran Khan's disillusionment is that Donald Trump had agreed to mediate on Kashmir issue on Imran Khan's request
 magar bharat ne sire se hi imran kii shaatir chaal ko naakaam karte hue
 Denied Trump's arbitration option
 ab imran khan ko is baat kii chintaa sata rahi he ki kashmir main dhara-370 khatm ho gai or pakistan kii koi sun hi nahin rahaa
 All hopes of Pakistan against abolishing special status of Kashmir rests on United Nations and America
 lekin america ne pehle hi ek bayaan dekar is masale se khud ko alag kar liya
 The US has taken cognizance that the Indian government has strictly described this step as its internal matter
 to kul milakar kashmir se dhara-370 ke khatme ke saath hi kashmir se pakistan kii napak ummiido kaa bhi khaatmaa ho gaya he
 Pakistan is also threatening war
 lekin pakistan khud bhi jaanata he ki ab kashmir ko lekar uske paas koi zyada vikalp bache nahin he
 And his extreme economy does not allow him to fight
 zaahir he bharat se aamane saamne kii jang pakistan ke liye mushkil he
 So to spread unrest in India along with the valley, Pakistan will take the same path that it has been following for the last three decades
 yani dehshat kaa rasta
 And this terror policy of Pakistan will be responsible for its 4 important representations of terror
 jinamein hafiz said, masood azhar, saiyad salauddin or daaud ibrahim ke naam shaamil hai
 These four were currently underground to improve the image of the country
 kyonki vazeer-e-aazam imran khan ko pichley maheene july main america kaa daura karnaa tha
 And on the issue of terror there, he did not want to do any kind of gritty
 magar ab america daura bhi khatm ho gaya he or ghati main dhara 370 bhi
 Therefore, sources are quoting from the reports that the Pakistani Army and ISI are reactivating these modules of terror
 magar pakistan shaayad ye bhul rahaa he ki bharat ko in aatankiyon ke thikaanon kaa ilm he
 Hindustan not only knows the whereabouts of these terrorists but also the experience of doing airstrikes like Balakot
 yani dehshat failaane kii koi bhi pakistani chaal us par baari pad sakati he
 Anna Hazare said that he was quite surprised by the nomination of cricketer Sachin Tendulkar for the Rajya Sabha and said that he could not understand what was going on
 anna ne sawalia lahaze main poocha ki sachin ko rajyasabha bhejne kii kya jarurat he, jabaki unhen bharat ratna diya janaa chahie tha
 At the same time, Anna defended Baba Ramdev on his comments, saying that what Ramdev has said is not wrong
 gauratlab he ki ramdev ne saansadon ko insaan ke bhesh main shaitan bataaya tha
 Anna said, "there is nothing wrong in what Ramdev said
 aaj kai logon ke khilaaf saboot hai
 When the party gives the ticket, why do they give it to the tainted person? "he said," The parties only think about the vote
 ve yah nahin sochatin ki jinhen ve khadaa kar rahi hai, ve apradhi hai
 What will happen to the temple of democracy if such people enter there
 ’’ Significantly, Ramdev had described the mps as Satan in the guise of humans
 anna ne kaha, ‘‘ramdev ne jo kuch bhi kaha usamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 There is evidence against many people today
 jab party tikat detii he, to ve daagdar vyakti ko kyon detii hai?’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘partiyaan keval vot ke bare main sochati hai
 She does not think that those whom she is standing for are criminals

 com / ulaqnw4uey — Shahid Afridi (@safridiofficial) February 5, 2018 Let us know that even before this, there have been many former players' tournaments
 khaas baat yah he ki ye chalange khud ICC kii ore se diya gaya tha
 Earlier, Sachin Tendulkar, Shane Warne also appeared in a tournament in the US for the ICC
 centre sarkaar ne IPC kii dhara 499 or 500 kii vakaalat karte hue kaha he ki aparaadhik manahani maamle kii sunwaayee 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko bheji jaani chahie
 However, the Supreme Court said that it would consider the issue during the hearing
 sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar kii ore se pesh atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki is maamle main ham euke jaise deshon se tulana nahin kar sakate
 There is a provision for early hearing in all cases
 hamaare desh main civil maamalon ke niptaare main bees-bees saal tak lag jate hai
 In such a case, criminal defamation should remain
 supreme court ne sarkaar se kaha he ki vah apana jawaab court main daakhil karen or ab agali sunwaayee 14 july ko hogi
 Actually, the Supreme Court is hearing petitions to repeal sections 499 and 500 of criminal defamation
 bijepi netaa subramanyam swami, congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal samet anya logon ne dhara ko chunauti dete hue kaha he ki ye kanoon asanvaidhanik he or moulik adhikaron kaa hanan karata he
 The comments pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne in sabhi logo ke kilaaf aparaadhik manahani ke alag-alag maamalon main nichali adaalaton main chal rahi sunwaayee par roak laga di thi or centre sarkaar se jawaab maanga tha
 The court had also stayed the circular issued regarding media of Delhi government but the Supreme Court will hear
 dilli sarkaar ne court main daakhil halafname main kaha he ki uski manshaa is kanoon ke durupyog ko rokane kii thi, lekin agar court ko lagata he ki ye circular galat he, to sarkaar ise waapas lene ko taiyaar he
 During the hearing, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Central Government, said that in this case we cannot compare with countries like UK
 vahaan puri tarah maamalon kii jald sunwaayee kii vyavastha he
 Civil cases in our country take twenty to twenty years to settle
 aise main aapraadhik manahani ko bane rahanaa chahie
 The Supreme Court has asked the government to file its reply in the court and now the next hearing will be on 14 July
 darasal, supreme court aparaadhik manahani kii dhara 499 or 500 ko radd karne kii yachikaaon par sunwaayee kar rahi he
 Others including BJP leader Subramanian Swamy, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have challenged the clause, saying the law is unconstitutional and violates fundamental rights
 tippaniyan In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had stayed the trial in the lower courts in separate cases of criminal defamation against all these people and sought a response from the Central Government
 court ne dilli sarkaar ke media ko lekar jari kiye gaye circular par bhi roak laga di thi lekin supreme court sunwaayee karegi
 The Delhi government has said in an affidavit filed in the court that its intention was to stop the misuse of this law, but if the court feels that this circular is wrong, the government is ready to withdraw it

 An important meeting of the Rashtriya Janata Dal is going to be held in Patna on Saturday 9 March
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle ho rahi is baithak main kai mahatvapurn faisle liye ja sakate hai
 The most important of which is to authorize former Chief Minister Rabri Devi to sign the ticket (symbol) given to the candidates of the Lok Sabha elections
 darasal, argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav chaara ghotaale maamle main jail main hai
 In such a situation, it will not be legally valid for the party president to sign the symbol from inside the jail
 isliye rabari devi ko ye jimmedaari saunpi ja rahi he
 It is worth noting that when RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav was going to jail for the first time in the fodder scam case in 1997, he resigned his Chief Minister and handed over the throne of Bihar to Rabri Devi
 ab phir ek baar rabari devi ko lalu yadav ke jail main rahane ke kaaran ye jimmedaari saupi ja rahi he
 However, Lalu Prasad Yadav has entrusted his political legacy to his younger son Tejashwi Yadav
 unhone mahagathbandhan sarkaar main upmukhyamantri kaa pad dilvaaya or baad main wo argedy ke sanghathan ko bina kisi pad kii jimmedaari ke sambhaal rahe hai, lekin iske baavjood lalu yadav ne ye jimmedaari rabari devi ko dene kii baat kahi he to iske peeche kii vajah party ko ekajute rakhana he
 Not only this, Rabri Devi will also preside over the separate meeting of the State and Central Parliamentary Board of the RJD
 is baithak main loksabhaa chunaav main party kii ranneetiyon par vichaar kiya jaayegaa
 There will be a meeting of the state parliamentary board at 10 am
 is baithak main paarit prastaav ko 12
 It will be presented at the meeting of the Central Parliamentary Board at 30 pm and a final decision will be taken on the proposal
 iske baad 2 baje dopaher main argedy vidhanmandal dal kii baithak hogi jisaki adhyakshata rabari devi karengi
 The decision on the distribution of the symbol by the convict is pending
 RJD was skeptical from the beginning as to whether Lalu Yadav can allot his candidates while in jail
 lekin raajnneetik visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki jail se lalu yadav ke simbel alott karne par jailer kaa counter hastakshar karnaa padegaa
 With this, the NDA can take political advantage in the election that RJD candidates are also set from jail
 rajd ke samvidhan ke mutabik rajd adhyaksh lalu yadav ko adhikaar he ki ve kisi ko bhi kaaryakari adhyaksh niyukt kar sakate hai
 However, the decision of whether the convicts can distribute the symbol or not is still pending at the Election Commission level
 uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati ne rajya kaa naam aatankwaad se jode jane par apni sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki yah jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he uske liye purvavarti mulaayam sarkaar kii galat nitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 At a press conference on Sunday, Mayawati told the Muslim community that no innocent person will be persecuted by associating them with terrorist activities
 saath hi unhone chetavanee dene ke andaaj main kaha ki bina kisi jati or samudaay ko dekhte hue aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 He said that during the tenure of the Mulayam government, terrorists had taken roots in the state
 saath hi unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar aatankwaad ko jad se mitaane ke liye kritasankalp he or isamen centre sarkaar kii puri madad karegi
 Maya said that to fight terrorism in the state, our government has formed anti-terrorism Squad (ATS), which is equipped with information and other modern weapons
 desh or khaskar rajya main badhati aatanki gatividhiyon ko dekhte hue mayawati ne pradesh ke sabhi divijinal kamishnaron, jila adhikariyon or police upayuktaon ko nirdesh dene ke liye ek baithak bulaai thi

 GURMEET RAM RAHIM (@gurmeetramrahim) August 24, 2017 Court rebuke The Punjab High Court has reprimanded the Central and State Government on this issue

 The court has asked to reply by 2 pm
 vahiin court ne deraa pramukh ko bhi notice jari kiya he
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim has been asked to help in law and order

 People are seen flocking to the park and pavements in the city

 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, the Ministry of Home Affairs has sent 167 companies of paramilitary forces
 isamen kul 97 companiyaan CRPF kii hai, jisamen 4 mahila company hai, jo punjab or haryana main tainaat kii gai hai
 Along with this, companies of 16 RAF, 37 SSB, 12 ITBP, 21 BSF have been deployed in Punjab and Haryana
 centre 24 ghante vahaan najar banaae hue he
 Schools and colleges will remain closed on Sunday in Punjab
 punjab, haryana or chandigarh main kul 64 hajaar jawan tainaat rahenge
 At the same time, the central government has sent 9700 CRPF personnel to Haryana to repair the security system
 rajya se lagi simaaon ko har taraf sil karke drone camaron se najar rakhi ja rahi he
 Section 144 is applicable in many districts
 duniya kii mudraon ko takat dikhaata bhartiya rupaya, agar, aapke rashtravaadi uchhaah kaa akelaa pratik nahin he or agar aapako lagata he ki bharat main tej aarthik growth va nae rojgaron ke liye sujh samaj or soch kii chemistry badalanaa jaruri he to ‘mek in india’ kaa idia aajamaaish ke kaabil he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited the whole world to set up production units in India from the Red Fort, to make the country the power of export, so coincidentally, time stands with them
 bharat ko growth kaa ingine shuru karne ke liye nivesh kaa nayaa eendhan chahie jabaki deshi or videshi niveshkon ko bharat main nivesh ke liye dirghakaalik growth kii ummid kii darkaar he
 Here, the world needs a new production center that can compete with China as China is now facing its native economy, so both time and need are suitable for 'make in India'
 kesaria or puraane swadeshi agrahon ko bhale hi yah baat hajam na ho, lekin niryaat kii duniya main kamjor mudra hi asli takat he or sanyog se bhartiya rupaya bhi duniya kii mudraon ke mukaable itnaa pratispardhi ho chukaa he ki vah modi ke mek in india sapane kii buniyaad ban saktaa he
 After getting the invitation for economic liberalization, the investors landed on the coast of India because the market of 100 crore population was waving here, where there was shortage of demand and demand
 utpaadan kaa pehla daur upabhokta maang ko puraa karne main nikal gaya
 Inflation and recession took hold even before the second round of production started and since demand was present and import duty was very cheap
 isliye utpaadan main aatmanirbhar banane chalaa bharat aayaat nirbhar ho gaya
 And general electronics began to be imported from abroad as a result, today electronics is the fourth largest import of India
 mek in india kii sujh ke saath modi bharat kii us aarthik gutthi ko kholane kii koshish kar rahe hai jiske kaaran udaarikaran ke 20 saal baad bhi bharat ke jidipi main rojgarparak menuphaccharing kaa hissaa keval 17 fisadi he jabaki china kaa 50 or malaysia kaa 40 fisadi jidipi factory utpaadan se aata he
 'make in India' is the relevant idea because the weakness of the domestic currency is a necessary condition for us to reach the world of exports
 sanyog se modi ke dilli pahunchane se pehle tak rupaya avamulyan ke ghat par dubkee laga chukaa he
 The current level of the rupee against the dollar is apt to lay the foundation for faster exports
 japan ne 1960 main kamjor yen kii takat chamakaayi thi or niryaat main chaar guna badhotaree ke saath ’70 ke dashak tak duniya par chaa gaya
 In the '70s, South Korea and Taiwan also chose this path
 ’90 ke dashak ke ant main china ne yuan kaa joardaar avamulyan kiya or 2009 main vah japan or korea se bada niryaatak ho gaya
 The decision to win and lose in the competition of export also depends on how weak the currency is in the competitive countries in the market
 is paimaane ke tahat kamjor rupye ke saath bharat ab china par bhi baari he
 Modi's advisers must have told him that since 2007 the Chinese Yuan has strengthened and the rupee has weakened
 isliye global bazaar main ab bharat ke niryaat china ke mukaable pratispardhaatmak ho chale hai
 Although China's manufacturing exports are ten times India's, but since 2007, India's growth in manufacturing exports is more than China
 yahi vajah he ki modi ne menuphaccharing or niryaat ko jodgaye kii koshish kii he
 The path to 'make in India' is not only long but also winding
 sarkaar ke bauddhik niamak or swadeshi ke suurama kamjor rupye ko desh kii kamajori maanenge
 Saffron will be guarded on foreign investment
 vishesh niryaat jone par laanat-malamat hogi or shram sudhaaron par jaldi sahmati nahin banani he
 Despite this, the idea of making India an export engine is appropriate because it was only by holding the finger of exports that investment in manufacturing in China increased, which brought growth and employment
 bharat ke jidipi main menuphaccharing kaa hissaa 1980 ke dashak se 16-17 fisadi par sthir he
 The previous government had announced a new manufacturing policy in October 2011, aiming at 25 per cent of factory production in GDP by 2022, which failed to do much
 achraj nahin ki modi kii manufakcharing niti darasal bharat kii videsh vyapaar niti hi ban jaae
 Narendra Modi's specialty is that they also do what they know very well
 gujarat kii menuphaccharing growth unke mukhyamantritv daur kii dein he jabaki global bazaaron se gujaratiyon kaa sadiyon purana rishta unhen viraasat main mila he
 In a book release program two years ago, Modi said that he wants to build a big waterway up to the Gulf of Khambhat to make Ahmedabad a port city
 yah kalpana 1894 main gujarat ke prasiddh kapadaa vyapaaree ranchhodlal kii thi
 Hence, on the very next day of Independence Day in Mumbai, when Modi told the need to connect ports by railway and road and the export spree between the states, it was estimated that the jugalbandi of manufacturing and export was prepared with full voice from the Red Fort

 New Delhi: Within 75 days of its publication, a dialogue was held at the India International Center Annex on Praveen Kumar Jha's book 'coolie Lines', which was going on for the second edition
 is kaarykram kii adhyakshata lok gayika malini avasthi ne kii
 Yatindra Mishra was present as the keynote speaker
 sanchaalan vaani prakaashan kii pradhan sampadak rashmi bharadwaj ne kiya
 Writer Praveen Kumar Jha said about the book that although many people have written the history of indentured people, more are being written, but for the first time in Hindi, an attempt has been made to put together the history of all the islands
 praveen jha ne bataaya ki girmitiyaa apni chha: peedi ke baad bhi apane aapako bhartiya maanate hai
 Initially their emancipation was prominent for the women who went out as indentured laborers, but later they also tried to save Indian culture
 is kitaab ke bare main lekhak yatindra mishra ne kaha ki har panne main lekhak kaa maanas khulata jaataa he
 Praveen has pierced the circle of history through this book, and whenever there is any research on this subject, this book will be seen as an ideal
 yatindra mishra ke anusaar ek eemaandaar, bhavuk or sahryday lekhak praveen ke andar he, jo is kitaab ke pannon se jhalkata he
 Malini Awasthi said that both the subject and the title of the book attract
 praveen ne us samay ke angrezon ke manovigyaan ko chuaa he
 He said that Indianism is seen more in Mauritius and Fiji
 agar aapako jaananaa he ki aap kya the to aap surinam or trinidad jaaiye, jahaan ke girmitiyaa logon ke vanshajon ne bhartiyata ke mul rup ko samarakshit rakhaa he
 Malini enchanted the audience by singing the song Bidesia on the occasion
 yaad rahe ki yah pustak vishwa ke sabase bade palaayan or apravas kaa itihaas he, jise lagbhag bhula diya gaya
 Millions of people were sent to the ship from the sea, by signing such papers which they could neither understand, nor read
 yah kahani he ek vishaal samrajya ke laalach kii or hindustaniyon ke sangharsh kii
 Many Hindustans away from India
 yah kahani kai gair-adalati sawaal puuchhati he un british sarkaron se, jinhone yah hone diya
 People who could never get justice

 One chapter is also based on Sikh migration to Canada
 bhartiya itihaaskaaron ne is vishay par kam likhaa
 The old indentured depot and office are no more
 girmitiyon ke agreement ke kaagaz ab bharat main puri tarah uplabdh nahin
 They are locked in many archive files of London, France, Netherlands and these Girmitia islands
 yah kuch pahaluon main pratham aisa vistrut prayaas he, jisamen sampoorn pravaas ke itihaas ko sametane kii koshish kii gayi he
 Bihar-born Praveen Kumar Jha is a writer of non-interest
 unhone ek saamaajik vyangy-sangrah ‘chamanlal kii diary', or do yatra sansmaran-iceland or nederland par likhe hai

 aise maahaul main mishra or unki team samaaj main tanaav dur karne or unke sakaaraatkata laane ke liye ek nai ranneeti par chal rahi he
 Here, instead of asking people the reason for their anger or concern, they are meeting in a very intimate way to restore their faith

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal says that in view of the sudden increase in prices of onions, the government has now decided to sell onions itself
 ek press conference ke dauraan pyaaj kii aasmaan chooti keemton ke bare main sawaal poochne par kejariwal ne kaha 'pyaaj kii keemat par dilli sarkaar kadam uthaane ja rahi he, jaise do-teen saal pehle hamane kiya tha
 We will try that around 24 rupees a kilo, we can supply more and more space through all our ration shops and mobile vans
 ' unhone kaha ki 'pyaaj ko transport karne ke liye tender jari kar die gaye hai, or mujhe lagata he ki 10 din ke andar ham log yah supplai shuru kar sakate hai
 According to Rajinder Sharma, an onion wholesaler in Azadpur Mandi, Delhi, "the rains that should have ended a month ago in South India, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are still happening, and where it is raining too much
" Has been isse pyaaj kii fasalon ko bahut nuksaan hua he
 Due to this, onion prices have increased
 ' rajendra sharma ke mutabik agar barsaat ruk jaati hai to agle ek hafte main daam girane shuru ho sakate hai varanaa dashahara ke baad jab rajasthan or haryana kii fasal aegi tab jaakar daam girane shuru honge
 According to traders in Delhi's Azadpur mandi, onion prices have risen due to fears of onion crop deteriorating due to heavy rains in southern states and delay in preparation of new crop
 isse pehle 2015 main pyaaj kaa bhav 50 rupee kilo se upar chalaa gaya tha
 However, the government is repeatedly saying that there is a full stock of onions
 dilli main beete shuukravaar ko pyaaj kii aavak 1,026 ton thi, jabaki dilli main pyaaj kii khapat takreeban 3,000 ton rojaanaa he
 However, due to increase in the price of onion, its consumption has also been affected and it has come down to 2,500 tonnes
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay ke aankadon ke anusaar, dilli main pichley saptaah pyaaj kii khudara keemat 57 rupee prati kilogram rahi
 It was Rs 56 in Mumbai, Rs 48 in Kolkata and Rs 34 in Chennai
 gurugram or jammu main pyaaj 60 rupee kilogram par pahunch gai he
 However, according to the data, by the end of last week, the retail price of onion reached Rs 70 to 80 kg
 isse pichley saptaah pyaaj kii keemat 50 se 60 rupee kilogram thi
 The central government has taken several steps to increase the supply of onions
 iske baavjood pyaaj ke daam chadh rahe hai
 "the government has taken several steps in the last few weeks to increase domestic supply and curb prices," a source said

 The Khattar government of Haryana has dismissed the Delhi Jal Board's charge of giving less water to the High Court

 iske alawa haryana ne kaha ki med isliye banaai gai thi jisase pradooshit pani ko dilli main jane se roka ja sake, lekin agar jal board ko usase etraj he to ham use hataane ko taiyaar hai

 Earlier last week, the Delhi High Court reprimanded the Haryana government over the cuts being made about water coming from Haryana to Delhi
 ab dilli hai court main 13 march se pehle dilli jal board ko apana paksh rijoinder kii shakl main hycourt main rakhana hoga
 Because at present, the Haryana government in its affidavit has dissuaded the Jal Board's charge of reducing the supply of Delhi
 jal board kaa aarope tha ki munak nahar se dilli aane vaale pani ko jagah-jagah roak kar dilli kii supplai ko kam kiya ja rahaa he, jagah-jagah med banaakar pani roka ja rahaa he
 And the result of this is that NDMC and areas of Central Delhi are forced to face water shortage for the last 2 weeks
 haalanki ye pehali baar nahin he ki dilli or haryana ke bich pani ke bantwaare ko lekar aarope pratyarope lage hon
 But this time the Delhi High Court is very serious about the problem
 aise bhi ummid kii ja sakati he ki dilli main aane vaale vakt main pani kii samasya vikaraal rup nahin legi

 This Govt never serious about Parliament It is believed that the stance of 4 political parties BJD, TRS, YSR and AIADMK will be important in the election of the Deputy Chairman

 sabarimala mandir me mahilaon ke pravesh sambandhi janhit yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan travnakor devasam board kii taraf se daleel di gai he ki jab masjidon main bhi mahilaon ke pravesh par pabandi he
 Then, on the basis of just one PIL, why is the temple case being heard only without any strong arguments? Because the case of violation of right to equality also applies to mosques
 travnakor devasam board ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi kii is daleel ke saath hi supreme court main sune ja rahe sabarimala ke ayyappa swami ke mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par pabandi ke maamle main ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 On behalf of the Travancore Devasam Board, it was said that women are not allowed to go to many mosques even during the menstruation phase
 singhvi ne court se poocha he ki desh ke shiya muslim muharram main apane sharir ko hathiyaaron ke waar se lahooluhaan kar lete hai
 There are many temples of Kali in the country where thorns are pierced in the skin
 shraddhalu twachaa main keelein chubha kar khud ko latakaate hai
 Will the Supreme Court ban this as being a promotion choice? The Travancore Devasam Board justified the ban on the entry of women between 10 and 55 years of age, saying that there are so many unique customs and laws on which Hindu Not only non-hindu people also have faith
 lihaaja mahaj ek janhit yachika ke aadhaar par hindu dharm ko nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Hearing the ban on the admission of women to the Sabarimala temple, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra has asked the Travancore Devasam Board to prove that the ban is an integral part of the religious faith
 court ne poocha he ki kya sirf rajaswala avasthaa kii vajah se mahilaayein malin ho jaati hai? lihaaja mahilaon ke mandir main daakhile par hi pabandi laga dena unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron or garima ke khilaaf he
 Taking a dig at the board, the court has asked that in the Kerala High Court it was said that the temple of Dev Ayyappa of Kisabarimala has an exemption for women to enter the first five days of the annual festival
 masalan koi paabandi nahin
 So why is the contradictory statement being made here? Let it be said that the management of the Sabarimala temple located on the Western Ghat hill in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala has argued in the apex court that women 'purity' due to menstruation condition Cannot maintain, so entry of women in the age group of 10 to 55 is forbidden in the temple
 gauratlab he ki is maamle main november, 2016 ko kerala sarkaar ne nyaayalay ko suchit kiya tha ki vah aitihaasik sabarimala mandir main sabhi aayu varg kii mahilaon ke pravesh ke paksh main he
 Initially, the LDF government of the state adopted a progressive approach in 2007, advocating the entry of women into the temple which was replaced by the Congress-led UDF government

 diarector es es rajamauli kii film bahubali ne bollywood or south film industry ke bich ke faasale ko behad kam kiya
 Since Bahubali, the popularity of South Indian films has increased in North India
 bollywood stars south kii filmon main bad chadhakar kaam kar rahe hai
 These include Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt, Vidya Balan
 bahubali fame prabhas ne saaho se bollywood main debyue main kiya
 Apart from Prabhas, the fans are waiting for many more South Indian stars to work in the Hindi film industry
 lekin dekha gaya he ki south ke bade superstars bollywood main kaam karne se kataraate hai
 Fan followings of stars like Mahesh Babu, Vijay Deverakonda, Allu Arjun, Vijay, Vikram, Yash are not only in South but all over the country
 inaki filmon ke hindi varjan ko north india main shandaar vylership milti he
 Why South Superstars do not work in Bollywood movies? The question is why despite being popular among Hindi fans, why do these stars not appear in Bollywood films? Despite the makers' approach, these actors are afraid to enter Bollywood
 iskaa jawaab prabhas kii haalia relies saaho se miltaa he
 Actually, language is the biggest hurdle for regional actors
 rajnikant, camel hasan jaise sitaron ko chhod kam hi riginal stars aise hai, jo hindi main tej tarraar hai

 acchhee koshish ke baavjood prabhas kii hindi parde par kamjor dikhi
 He was also trolled for poor dialog delivery
 sambhav he ki duusare south sitare bhi kharaab hindi kii vajah se duusari industry main jane se kataraate hon
 After gaining stardom and fame in one industry, it is difficult for the stars to establish themselves in another industry
 wo bhi tab jab unhen hindi naa aati ho
 The second reason may be stardom and status
 apni industry ke hero ye south superstars ek khaas stats enjoy karte hai
 If the debut in the other industry did not flop, then it could prove to be harmful for his stardom
 bollywood main jamane ke liye in south superstars ko hindi par kaman or sahi project salection par dhyaan dena hoga

 bhartiya team ke sahaayak coach sanjay bangar ne kaha he ki team prabandhan ke paas rabindra jadeja ko bhi antim-11 main shaamil karne kaa vikalp he jiske bare main vah nishchit taur par vichaar karenge
 In the match played against England on Sunday, leg-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep got a lot of runs
 isi ke saath jadeja ko team main shaamil kiye jane kii charchaa garam ho gai
 However, Bangar has said that Chahal and Kuldeep's failure against England is an occasional occurrence
 bangar ne kaha, 'ham sabhi tarah ke sangyojan aajamaane ke liye taiyaar hai, jahaan hamaare paas teen tej gendbaaj wo bhi hardik pandya alag se, kaa bhi vikalp he to vahiin ham jadeja ko bhi team main shaamil kar sakate hai

 He has done his job in five of the seven matches
 agar aap dakshin africa ke khilaaf match ko dekhenge to unhone rohit ke saath 70 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 He then did what he should have done in the match against Australia as well
