 Venkaiah Naidu said in New Delhi on November 22 in India Today's state of affairs and direction conclave, "india is developing at a fast pace
" lekin hamen yah bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki desh kii 20 fisadi aabaadi garibi rekha se neeche jivan bitaa rahi he or unamem se 20 pratishat nirakshar hai

 He lashed out for the fact that the news of development is missing in the media agenda while the 'news of development can be too spicy'
 unhone kaha, ''vichaaron ko khabaron ke rup main dikhaaya jaataa he, yah nahin hona chahie
 Naidu, known for his one-line sarcasm, advised those who want to succeed in public life
 unhone kaha, ''agar aapke andar glamer, grammer or humar (hasyabodh) he to 'reumor (afvaah) ke liye koi gunjaaish nahin rahegi
 Any one of these properties will not suffice

 krime, anderworld, builder mafia, bollywood or politics se guzarate hue encounter specialists kii kahani kehane ke liye kabir kowshik ne acchhee-khaasi research kii he, jo film main jhalkati bhi he, lekin teji se istemaal kii gai police department kii andruni bhashaa aam janata samaj paaegi, isamen thodaa andeh he
 
 
 Sonu Sood and Naseeruddin Shah's performances are good, the film is interesting till the interval, but after that the story gets lost between successive encounters, and the film starts to get bored

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Front (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti called the Kashmir problem a political problem and said that this political issue needs to be resolved at the political level
 is maamle main pakistan samet sabhi pakshon ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Mehbooba Mufti, who ran the government in Jammu and Kashmir with bjp's support, tweeted on Monday that a political solution to this political issue is needed
 isamen pakistan samet sabhi paksh shaamil hon
 The former Chief Minister said that since 1947, governments have been looking at Kashmir with safety glasses
 nae grih mantri amit shah se bal prayog ke madhyam se twarit sudhaar kii ummid karnaa haasyaaspad he
 Since 1947, Kashmir's been looked through the prism of security by successive governments
 It’s a political problem that needs a political redressal by involving all stakeholders inc Pak
 Expecting a quick fix through brute force by newly appointed HM is ridiculously naive — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) June 3, 2019 Significantly, the Modi government came to power once again with a strong mandate, during the Lok Sabha election campaign, Article 370 and Promised to abolish Article 35A
 bijepi ke sankalp patr main bhi iskaa ullekh tha
 After the party's president Amit Shah has been appointed as home minister in place of Rajnath Singh in the new government, he is expected to deal with the situation in Kashmir strictly
 hurriyat ne bhi jataai ummidamahabooba mufti se pehle hurriyat conference ke adhyaksh mirwij umr faruk ne bhi shuukravaar ko ummid jataai thi ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii baatcheet kii peshkash par endie kii nai sarkaar gambhirtha se vichaar karegi
 The separatist leader Farooq had said that the overwhelming vote in favor of BJP by the people of India gives Modi a chance to play a decisive role in resolving the long-pending Kashmir problem
 mirwij ne ramajaan ke aakhri shuukravaar 'jumat-ul-vidaa' par jama masjid main namaaj ke baad khutaba (upadesh) dete hue yah baaten kahi thim
 Expectations of strictness from Shah: The situation in Kashmir valley has always been worrying for the government
 kuch varsh purv ai bheeshan baadh ke samay ko hataa den jisamen kashmiri madad main jute sena ke javaanon kii tarif karte nahin thak rahe the, lekin ab kashmir se patharbaji kii khabaron kaa aana aam baat he
 Slogans in support of Pakistan, there has always been a demand to deal strictly with those who stone the army
 ab jabaki piem modi ne sakht chhavi ke amit shah ko grih mantralay saunp diya he, logon ko ummid he ki vah isse sakhti se niptenge
 In the capital, a 20-year-old girl, who showed courage, handed over the molested boy to the police
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki yah ghatana mangalvaar kareeb shaam saat baje ghati
 The 12th grade student was walking with her mother in Nehru Park, Chanakyapuri
 us dauraan 22 saal ke yuvak manjit ne uske saath chhedhkhani shuru kar di
 The girl was unheard of at first but when the young man did not listen, the girl informed the police and her family members
 police aane kii baat jaanakar manjit ne bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin ladki ne peechha kar use pakad liya
 At the same time, his family also reached
 police ke pahunchane par manjit ko police ke hawaale kar diya
 On June 18 last year, all the 'rulers' of BJP gathered in Ghaziabad
 centre or rajya ke mantriyon samet kul 14 saansad or 59 vidhayakon ke saath mukhyamantri yogi adityanath bhi is baithak main maujuud the
 Everyone had wrinkles on their foreheads
 isaki vajah thi lagaataar upachunaavon main mil rahi haar
 One by one, the BJP had lost the elections in Phulpur, Gorakhpur, Kairana and Nurpur
 netritv kshamta par khadey hone lage the sawalsube kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad lagaataar paraajay se yogi adityanath kii netritv kshamta par dabe sur main sawaal hone lage the
 The question found in Gorakhpur was that whether Yogi's Hindutva and fundamentalist image was being damaged? Is communal polarization harming the party? Yogi's staunch Hindutva image had come into the dock
 kaha jane laga tha ki jis tarah yogi ke netritv main upachunaavon main pradarshan rahaa he, agar ye silsilaa 2019 ke chunaav main bhi jari rahaa to iskaa puraa thikra unheen ke sir phutegaa
 Just before the general elections of 'ali Bajrang Bali' and 'hara Virus', the SP, BSP got a new formula of victory of 'alliance' just before the general elections of 2019, Yogi quickly sharpened the edge of Hindutva in his familiar style
 firebrands yogi pehle se or zyada ugr ho gaye
 Statements like 'ali Bajrang Bali' and 'hara Virus' are the hallmarks of this
 ab 2019 kaa rigelt aane se pehle hue agsit pole bataate hai ki upi kii janata ko yogi kaa ye andaaj pasand he
 WHAT SAYS Under the exit poll alliance formula, BSP 38, SP 37 and RLD contested three seats out of 80 in the state
 raajnneetik pandit bhi maanane lage the ki is baar bijepi ko upi main sarvaadhik nuksaan hone ja rahaa he
 But exit polls tell these different stories
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole (exit Poll) main soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ko 62-68 siten, sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 10 se 16 siten or congress ko 1 se do siten milti hui dikh rahi hai
 If the exit polls are proved to be correct on 23 May, along with Modi Magic, the brand yogi will have to give credit for this
 yogi ne apni netritv kshamta kaa is baar loha manvaaya he
 As soon as the exit poll comes, Yogi's stature is bound to increase in the coming times
 rashtrawaad kaa chunaav main jamkar istemaalchunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jis tarah se sena kii shauryagatha kaa bakhaan karte hue air strike kaa zikr kiya, usne ek nayaa nerrative set kar diya
 Going a step further, Yogi used fierce Hindutva and nationalism throughout the propaganda
 nae tevar se yogi hindutv ke poster bvoy banakar ubhare hai
 It was the magic of Yogi that in other states too many people were reaching to hear him
 vahiin yogi ke mukaable akhilesh yadav kii pradesh main kaaphi kam reliyaan huin
 The party redeemed the image of staunch Hindutva: Doubt Yogi is one of the leading leaders in BJP in terms of popularity after PM Modi
 unki kattar hindutv vaali chhavi ko dekhte hue hi bijepi ne is baar chunaav prachaar main unhen puri tarah jhonk rakhaa tha
 Not only did Yogi hold rallies and road shows, he was also very vocal in social media
 puure prachaar ke dauraan yogi apni firebrands style main vipakshiyon ko nishane par lete rahe
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, Yogi also held several rallies in the states where assembly elections were held
 9 rajyon main tabadatod 150 chunavi reliyaan-sabhaayen24 april ko saharanpur main vijay sankalp raily ke saath yogi ne loksabhaa chunaav prachaar kaa aagaaj kiya
 After this, Yogi continued to hold rallies continuously without stopping
 uttar pradesh ke baahar yogi kii kaaphi demand rahi
 On the party's orders, Yogi held rallies and road shows in almost all major states
 24 april se 17 may ke bich 9 rajyon main yogi ne takreeban 150 reliyaan or chunaav sabhaayen kin
 Hindutva and nationalism have been on his main agenda ever since Adityanath, who was mentioned in the air strike rallies, took charge of the state
 yogi ne aate hi sloter house par shikanja ksaa to vahiin elaan dekar kaha ki kanvad yatra par kisi prakaar kii roak-tok nahin hogi
 Flowers were also showered on the kawandis
 chunaav aae to yogi ne hindutv ke agenda ko bharpoor dhar di
 By referring to air strikes at rallies, Yogi made nationalism his main weapon
 gathbandhan ko di shikast, priyanka kaa parakram bhi bekaaris baar bijepi ke liye upi kii raah aasaan nahin thi
 Last time BJP won 71 seats and its ally Apna Dal won two seats
 lekin is baar vajood kii ladaai main SP or BSP kii 24 saal puraani dushmani bhi khatm ho gai
 Two Dhruv-like parties struck a friendship
 isse yogi adityanath kii jimmedaari or bad gai, jise unhone bakhubi nibhaayaa
 Talking about Congress, Priyanka Gandhi was roped in to give life to this party
 isse laga ki upi is baar bijepi ke haath se nikal gaya, lekin yogi ne ise bhi vifal kar diya
 Priyanka too could not show any might here
 rahul se zyada nishane par ‘buaa-babua’puure prachaar abhiyaan main yogi ke nishane par rahul gandhi se zyada akhilesh yadav or mayawati raheen
 He quipped several times on bua-babua
 unhone kaha ki 23 may ke baad yahi 'dost' 'dushman' ban jaaenge
 He also honored the SP-BSP with all the metaphors
 bundelkhand main yogi ne inaki dosti par tanj karte hue kabir ke dohe 'jhuthe ko jhootha mili, duna bandhe saneh' bhi sunaaya
 During the 72-hour ban, he also crossed the limit of dignity several times during the message, which he had to bear the brunt
 chunaav ayog ne un par 16 april se teen din kaa bain laga diya
 But, Yogi also made full use of these 72 hours and worshiped and gave a message to the voters
 pehle din yogi lakhanu ke hanuman sethu mandir darshan karne pahunche to agle din ayodhya main ramalala ke darshan kiye
 On the third day Yogi reached Banaras and saw Kashi Vishwanath there
 kya bigade bol se bani baat?chunaav prachaar ke dauraan yogi ne kai baar aise bayaan die, jisane virodhiyon ko mauka diya
 On 5 April, Yogi called the Muslim League a green virus, and on 9 April in Meerut said that Congress, SP, BSP believe in Ali and we also believe in Bajrang Bali
 mukhyamantri banane se pehle yogi kaa ek or bayaan kaaphi surkhiyon main rahaa tha jo unki kattar chhavi ko pesh karata he
 Yogi had said that if they convert one Hindu girl, then we will convert 100 Muslim girls
 yogi ke is bayaan kii kaaphi aalochana hui, lekin yogi kii isi chhavi ne unhen kaaphi siyaasi phayda pahunchaaya
 Yogi has also been the star campaigner of the BJP in the assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Chhattisgarh, just before the elections
 paanch main se chaar rajyon main akele yogi adityanath ne 70 sabhaayen kin
 Yogi held the highest number of 26 election meetings in Rajasthan
 vahiin, chhattisgarh main unhone 19 sabhaayen kii
 He addressed 17 election meetings in Madhya Pradesh
 vahiin, telugana main siem yogi kii 8 sabhaayen huin
 Earlier, Yogi also held several meetings in Karnataka and Gujarat assembly elections
 aankadon ke mutabik gujarat kii 35 main se un 26 siton par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii jahaan par yogi ne sabhaayen kin

 AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj said that nothing has happened as the benefits of the post are being charged

 madhyapradesh kii congress sarkaar ko kargar banane ke liye mukhyamantri kamalnath ne ek nayaa formula taiyaar kiya he
 For this permission, he has also written a letter to Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
 kamalnath ne formule ke tahat pramukh netaaon ke-cote ke mantriyon ko hataakar sarkaar ko samarthan dene vaale gaiyr congressi vidhayakon ko mantri banane kii yejna he
 This information has been given by the news agency INS
 rajya main congress ko purna bahumat hasil nahin he or maujuuda congress sarkaar- bahujan samaaj party (BSP), samaajawaadee party (SP) or nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan se chal rahi he
 At the same time, BJP leaders have been constantly making statements and saying that the government is toppled
 jisaki vajah se sarkaar ko samarthan dene vaale vidhayakon kii naaraazgi bhi surkhiyon main rahi he
 Kamal Nath has designed this formula keeping in mind the interest of non-congress mlas
 rajya sarkaar main kul 28 mantri hai
 It has 10 ministers from Kamal Nath quota and 7-7 ministers from Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia quota
 vidhayakon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par abhi 6 or sadasyon ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, lekin kamalnath in khaali padon ko bharne kii bajaay netaa-cote ke mantriyon kii sankhya kam karnaa chaahate hai or vahiin 6 rikt sthanon ko aisa hi rakhane kaa vichaar bhi bana liya he
 In a letter written to Sonia Gandhi, Kamal Nath has also sought permission for the exclusion of two ministers from the quota of the three top leaders (kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia)
 congress sutron kaa daawa he ki kamalnath ne sonia gandhi ko jo patr likhaa he, usamen kaha gaya he ki agar nirdaleey vidhayakon ko mantri bana diya jaae to bhaajapa kii ore se vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht kii jo koshish kii ja rahi he, vah safal nahin hogi
 Looking at the position of mlas in the state assembly, it is found that in the assembly of 230 members - 114 of Congress, 108 of BJP, 2 of BSP, 1 of SP and 4 are independent mlas
 abhi haal hi main ek seat khaali hui he, kyonki jhabua se vidhayak rahe ji es
 Damore has won the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ko basapa ke 2, sapa ke 1 or 4 nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 In which there is an independent minister, while three are waiting to become ministers
 vahiin samarthan karne vaale anya vidhayak bhi qatari main hai
 In this way, 3 independent mlas and 2 BSP and 1 SP SP mlas are working on a plan to make Kamal Nath a minister, so that the dissent of these supporting mlas is suppressed and there is no threat to the government

 narendra modi kii cabinet main piyush goyal ek aise sadsy hai, jo har vakt urja se labarej hote hai
 The Union Minister of Power, Coal and Renewable Energy can be seen checking his phone every five minutes
 isaki vajah yah nahin he ki unka dhyaan kahin or hota he, balki isliye ki ve apane mantralay se sambandhit taaja jaankariyaan paane ke liye hameshaa tatpar rahete hai
 These details include the amount of daily coal production from all 100 large power plants in the country, the number of sales of electricity-saving LED bulbs and the progress of electrification in the 18,000 villages where the NDA government is in power
 There was no electricity two seasons before the arrival of summer

 Apart from this, they have also opened the doors for renewable energy so that it can be joined step by step with the world facing the challenges of climate change
 aankade bhi goyal kii safalataa kii kahani kehete hai
 3 in India in 2014–15
 1 karod ton koyale kaa utpaadan hua
 This amount is equal to the total production of coal in the four years preceding it
 itnaa hi nahin, 2014 main 66 bade bijli sanyantron main koyale kaa bhandar bahut najuk str par pahunch gaya tha, jiskaa matlab he ki yah bhandar saat din se bhi kam samay ke liye tha
 But today the situation is different and these plants have an average coal stock of 25 days

 Says Goyal, "our mantra is more than necessary, cheap and environmentally friendly electricity with transparency
 ''bijli samavarti suchi main aati he, jiskaa matlab he vibhinn pahaluon par centre or rajya donon kaa samaan adhikaar he
 One of the biggest challenges before Goyal was to bring the states ruled by the opposition parties in line with the government's directives
 unhone ek aakarshak discom (rajya bijli vitaran companiyaan) package 'udai' ke saath un rajyon ko manaa liya
 This package provides huge relief to the State Governments and discoms in payment of interest on the loan
 badale main 'udai' rajyon or discom ko smart meter lagane or bijli chori ke khilaaf abhiyaan shuru karne ke liye baadhya karata he
 So far 18 states have given their consent for this

 lekin aage kii chunautiyaan ab bhi aasaan nahin hai
 The goals facing Goyal's ministries are extremely challenging — doubling coal production to one billion tons per year, increasing power generation by 50 percent by 2020, increasing renewable energy capacity five-fold by 2022, and by 2020 Saving 10% of the current energy consumption
 iity madras main padhaane vaale bijli visheshgy ashok jhunjhunwaala kehete hai, ''bijli ke kshetra main jabardast kayapalat hua he, or yah sector ke lagbhag sabhi maamalon main dekha ja saktaa he
 But if we want that we continue to get electricity without interruption in the whole country, then we still need to do more

 After the Quit India Movement of August 1942, the British government adopted a repressive policy on Indian newspapers, which also suffered the brunt of the National Herald
 1942 se lekar 1945 tak neshnal herald ko apana prakaashan band karnaa padaa
 The magazine resumed its publication in 1945 and Feroze Gandhi was the managing director of the magazine from 1946 to 1950 and the magazine's financial condition also improved during this period
 1970 ke dashak main apatkaal ke baad 1977 ke chunaav main indira gandhi kii paraajay ke baad neshnal herald do saal ke liye band rahaa
 Although the situation came to an end in 1986, the magazine continued to be published after the intervention of Rajiv Gandhi
 saal 2008 main vittiya vajahon se ek baar phir neshnal herald ko apana prakaashan band karnaa padaa
 The Future of the Herald remains connected with the Congress and the Gandhi family
 There is no need to tell the Congress and the Gandhi family
 aise main congress ke bure daur main neshnal herald bhi mushkil main rahaa or achche dinon main akhbaar bhi thikthak chalata rahaa
 But despite being in power in 2008, the newspaper had to cease its publication and in 2014, when the Congress is out of power and in its worst phase, the future of the National Herald is being tried once again

 Apart from this, it is alleged that in 2010, by creating a company named Young Indian, the assets of AJL were renamed as Young Indian Company
 yang indian company main rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi nideshak hai
 It is being said that in order to deal with all these things, preparations were started to be published again in a hurry, so that the Gandhi family's charge of grabbing property could be proved wrong

 ) The sharing of the platform of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has triggered new political equations
 is dosti se kejariwal ke khilaaf awaajen uth rahi hai to lalu bhi nitish se naakhush bataae ja rahe hai
 Kejriwal also seems to have grown weary of the 'ekla Chalo' policy
 siyaasi lihaaj se dekhen tosath-saath chalanadonon netaaon ke liye bura sauda nahin he
 If Nitish is eyeing Bihar elections, Kejriwal is looking at the sky of the future
 jaaniye is dosti se nitish or kejariwal ko kya-kya phaayde ho sakate hai:1
 Kejriwal's image benefits Nitish
 Kejriwal is surrounded by controversies, but his image is that of an honest leader
 anna andolan se lekar prachand bahumat se sarkaar banane tak unka kaamyaab safar chamatkrit kar dene vaala he
 In such a situation, Nitish would like to attract Bihari voters who like clean and honest politics by showing them with him
 kejariwal kii raajnneetik parikshabihar main abhi nahin hui he, lekin desh ke zyaadaatar rajyon main unka apana fain base he, jisamen padhe-likhe yuvaaon kii bharmaar he
 Nitish would like to take advantage of this
 dilli main kejariwal kii nimna aarthik varg or yuvaaon main majboot pakad he
 If Nitish gets any benefit of appearing with Kejriwal, then he will definitely be happy
 2
 In the formal anti-modi front, Kejriwal's formal entry in the Congress is thin and the anti-modi front is struggling with the absence of a popular leader
 nitish ke saath khadey hokar kejariwal us morche main send lagaate hue apni maujuudagi darj kara rahe hai
 Even as a leader of the Third Front in the coming politics, many political experts do not dismiss his chances
 3
 Delhi will get friend Nitish Kumar has helped the Delhi government many times during his tenure and he seems more keen on Kejriwal's friendship
 aapako yaad hoga nitish ne bihar cader ke afasar dilli ke anti karpshan beuro ke liye bhejnaa sweekaar kiya tha
 Whenever Nitish comes to Delhi, he does not return without meeting Kejriwal
 beete do maheenon main paanch baar donon kii mulaakaat ho chuki he
 In such a situation, if Nitish again takes over as the CM chair in Bihar, Delhi will probably get the only 'friend government' in the country, which can help on administrative and other issues
 4
 You will support each other's issues
 You will remember that in the last few months Nitish Kumar has been reacting continuously to the issues of Delhi
 vah kejariwal sarkaar kii dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kaa samarthan bhi kar chuke hai
 He also said on the lg-kejriwal dispute that this is the kind of government that the Chief Minister cannot transfer officers, yet he has all the responsibility
 agar nitish jite to is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki aane vaale samay main vah kejariwal ke or kejariwal unke kuch muddon kaa khulkar samarthan karenge
 This conditional and balanced jugalbandi of both will not be pleasant for BJP

 Kejriwal, a successful face against Modi, is a successful representative of Vijay against Narendra Modi
 bijepi ne pichley dilli vidhansabha main kiran bedi ko siem candidet banaaya, lekin vot modi ke naam par hi maange gaye
 The Prime Minister held four big rallies in Delhi
 badi-badi hordings par unheen kii tasviren lagaai gai thim
 Despite this, the BJP lost the election badly
 70 main se 67 siten jitkar kejariwal kii AAP ne itihaas rachaa or desh main yah charchaa aam hui ki kejariwal ne modi kaa rath roak liya
 In Bihar too, it is Modi versus Nitish
 aise main modi par vijay paa chuke ek shaks ko saath laakar manovaigyanik str par nitish ne ek jaandaar siyaasi daanv khelaa he
 Remember, recently, while sharing the stage in Delhi with Kejriwal, Nitish had repeated a line from the Prime Minister, 'what is the mood of the country, is the mood of Delhi', and further added, 'which is the mood of Delhi , That is the mood of Bihar

 96 lakh voton ke, antar se chunaav jitkar itihaas rach daalaa he
 Earlier, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Anil Basu of Marxist Communist Party 5
 92 lakh maton ke antar se jeet darj karke record banaaya tha, jise ab preetam munde todane main kaamyaab raheen
 In the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also won Vadodara seat of Gujarat by more than five lakh 70 thousand votes and he was deprived of nearly 22 thousand votes by breaking Basu's record, but now Pritam Munde has broken this record on his own party ticket

 Defeated by 96 votes
 preetam ko kul 9,22,416 vot praapt hue, vahiin patil ko 2,26,095 vot praapt hue
 By far the highest difference in the history of Lok Sabha elections in the country (5
 92 lakh vot) se chunaav jeetne kaa record makapa ke anil basu ke naam tha, jo ab pankaja ke naam he
 On the other hand, the record for winning by the lowest margin (9-9 votes) is in the names of Konathala Ramakrishna, who contested on the Congress ticket and Som Marandi of the BJP
 bharat ke chunaav ayog ke aankadon ke anusaar, varsh 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main makapa ke anil basu ne pashchim bengal ke arambagh se chunaav ladaa tha or 5,92,502 maton se jeet darj kii thi

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi is a figure who comes back to former President Pranab Mukherjee's book The Coalition Years
 kitaab main ek badi baat yah bhi he ki mukherjee ko laga tha ki 2012 main sonia manmohan singh ko raashtrapati or unhen pradhanmantri banaaengi
 The Congress president was not on the stage at the launch of the book in New Delhi on 13 October
 alabatta jab makapa ke netaa seetaram yechuri ne purv raashtrapati kii hathi sareekhee yaaddaasht ke kaside padhe, tab sonia muskaraayi or unhone apni do ungliyaan uthaa deen—mukherjee kii darasal do haathiyon sareekhee yaaddaasht thi
 According to the book, Mukherjee's power to forgive also appears to be double
 dilli main dukaanon kii lagaataar ho rahi ceiling ko ek bada mudda banaate hue dilli ke saikadon vyapaariyon ne guuruuvaar ko jantar mantar par confederation of aal india treders (cat) dwaara yojit ek dharne main monitering cameti kii katu aalochana kii
 He said that due to the undemocratic and obstinate attitude of the Monitoring Committee, there is a havoc of sealing in Delhi and even though the seal of a business establishment is not open yet
 vyapaariyon ne kaha ki desh kii rajdhani dilli main lakhon logon ke saamne roji roti kaa ek bada sankat khadaa ho gaya he kyonki pichley ek varsh se dilli main hajaaron dukaane sil hone ke kaaran band padi hai
 CAT has demanded the government to take concrete steps to stop sealing in Delhi now and the government should either bring a bill on the issue in the current session of Parliament or an ordinance immediately after the Parliament session in which a cut-off date is announced
 
 us cat of date tak dilli main jo bhi sthiti thi use barqaraar rakhaa jaae
 There should be a provision in the bill or ordinance to open the seal of shops closed by sealing
 cat ne sarkaar se yah bhi maang kii he ki monitering cameti ke taanaashaahee ravaiye ko dekhte hue sarkaar supreme court se monitering cameti ko bhang karne kii maang kare
 The traders involved in the dharna shouted slogans against the ceiling and monitoring committee and also burnt an effigy of the monitoring committee
 dilli main lagbhag 7 lakh vyapaaree hai jo lagbhag 25 lakh logon ko rojgaar dete hai
 In this sense, sealing is nothing less than a demon for the traders of Delhi
 cat ke rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne bataaya ki dilli main ceiling vyapaariyon evam unke karmchaariyon kii roji roti se judaa hone ke kaaran bada mudda he
 Thousands of shops have been sealed in Delhi in the last one year from December 2017 till now, on the other hand, the ceiling of hanging ceiling hangs on thousands of other shops
 supreme court main maamla lambey samay se chal rahaa he or koi faisla nahin ho rahaa he
 The businessmen's side is not being kept in court
 khandelwal ne spasht rup se kaha ki sarkari zamin par yadi kisi ne qabza kiya he to uske kilaaf karrwai kii jaae, vyapaariyon ko koi etraj nahin hoga
 But it is highly undemocratic to seal the shops of merchants that have been trading for decades without any notice and enough time

 ’chhid jaae vyapaar yudhiske saath hi unhone is baat par jor diya ki unhen isaki parvaah nahin he ki china ke saath vyapaar yuddh chhid jaae
 At the rally, Trump said, "these people say there will be a trade war
" vyapaar yuddh? ham china ke saath 500 arab dollar gavaan rahe hai
 Who cares even if there is a trade war

 There is talk of 500 billion dollars here and telling me about the trade war

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday rallied in three places in eastern Uttar Pradesh, including Mirzapur
 mirzapur raily kii ek tasviir soshal media par khub viral kii ja rahi he, jisamen yah dikh rahaa he ki muslim mahilaayein aage kii pankti main baithkar modi ke liye josh ke saath naare laga rahi hai
 Thousands of BJP supporters on social media are claiming on the basis of this photo that Modi's popularity is now speaking to Muslim women
 yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he ki bijepi, muslim mahilaon kaa dil jitkar alpsankhyakon ke votbank main bantwaare kii lagaataar koshish kar rahi he
 Whether it is about Sharia courts, Hallala or triple talaq
 bijepilgataar yah sandesh dene kii koshish kar rahi he ki sirf vahi ek aisi party he jo muslim mahilaon ke hiton ko lekar chintit he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also raised the question in Azamgarh in his speech during a tour of eastern Uttar Pradesh, whether the Congress, which claims to be the party of Muslims, is only a party of Muslim men? We decided to do a viral test on the photo that has been tried to show the support of Muslim women at the rally in Mirzapur
 photo main burka pahane teen mahilaayein josh main naare lagaate hue dikh rahi hai, jinke gale main bijepi ke nishaan vaala gamchaa he
 Looking at the photo very carefully, it shows that a BJP banner is also visible on the left side
 lekin usamen camel nishaan ke saath bijepi shabd hindi, angreji yaa urdu main nahin main nahin balki kisi or bhashaa main likhaa hua he
 At the Uttar Pradesh rally, the bjp's name is not likely to be written in Hindi or English or in any other language
 isiilie hamane is photo kii khoj kerani shuru kii
 While searching for where this photo came from, we found such a picture, seeing that it is clear that a photo showing the participation of only Muslim women has been made from this photo
 is badi photo ko dekhakar yah baat saaf ho jaati he ki is raily main burka pahane teen mahilaon ke alaava duusare tamaam log bhi baithe hue hai lekin khaas makasad se photo ko crop karke aisi tasviir nikaali gai he jisase sirf muslim mahilaon vaali baat saamne aae
 This photo is actually a rally of Modi during the Karnataka election which was taken on 9 May
 poster par kannada bhashaa main “bijepi” likhaa hua he
 During the Karnataka assembly election campaign, Modi held three meetings in Bangarpet, Chikmagalur and Belagavi on 9 May
 modi ne uske baad khud apane twitor se kai tasviren share kii thim, jinamein se ek tasviir yah bhi thi
 After that many other people also shared it
 karnataka chunaav ke dauraan khud modi dwaara twit kii gai puraani photo ko raajnneetik makasad se upi kaa bataakar bhram failaayaa ja rahaa he
 The photo is real and the rally is also of Modi

 congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne somvaar ko gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par palatwaar kiya
 He has said that Modi should first describe the definition of secularism
 darasal, modi ne ravivaar ko pune main kaha tha ki congress jab sankat main aati he to secularism ke burke main chhip jaati he
 Taking a dig at this statement of Modi, Digvijay said that the secularism of the Sangh and the BJP is different
 ve maanate hai ki ek desh, ek dharm or ek samskruti honi chahie
 Digvijay said, 'what is secularism in the eyes of Modi? What is Modi's definition of secularism? What Modi says about secularism, we would like to hear first
 kyonki jo paribhaasha adwani kii he or jo bijepi-sangh kii rahi he wo alag he
 They believe in one religion, one culture and one nation
 'isi ke saath digvijay ne patrakaron se yah bhi kaha ki ve modi ke bare main sawaal naa puuchhen
 He said, 'you don't ask me more questions about Modi ji, because i don't want to give him preference
 'gauratlab he ki pune kii raily main ravivaar ko modi ne kaha tha ki congress jab sankat main aati he to secularism ke burke main chhip jaati he
 He had said, "look carefully
 jab bhi congress ko chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, chaahe vah bhrashtachar ho, mahangaai ho, supreme court ke nirdesh hon, kisi mantri kaa jail janaa ho, ladakiyon se balaatkaar ho yaa asuraksha kaa maahaul ho, ve logon ko jawaab nahin dete
 Whenever a crisis arises, they wear the 'burqa' of secularism and hide in a bunker
 'isse pehle unhone shuukravaar ko samachar agency royatres ko die ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki unke liye dharmanirpekshata 'bharat pehle' he
 According to Modi, 'what is the definition of secularism? Secularism for me means 'india first'
 meri party kaa siddhant he, 'sabhi ko nyaay mili
 Appeasement not for anyone
 ' hamaare liye yahi dharmanirpekshata he
 ' brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika (biemasi)ke chunaav ho jane or nattejey aa jane ke baad ab satta ke liye sangharsh tej ho gaya he
 There is speculation that there may be an alliance between Shiv Sena and Congress
 shivasena biemasiki satta par kabiz hona chaahati he or iske liye wo sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he
 At the same time, Congress wants to increase the distance between Shiv Sena and BJP
 vishleshkon kaa to yah bhi maananaa he ki agar bijepi ko sabak sikhaane kii manshaa se shivasena, congress se kisi bhi tarah kaa gathjod karti he to wo maharashtra main vahi galati karegi jo upi meghkhilesh yadavane kiya he
 Here Mulayam Singh Yadav's statement is being taken that he gave after sp-congress alliance in UP
 mulaayam singh yadav ne apane bete or upi ke siem akhilesh yadav ko kaha tha ki wo galati kar rahe hai
 Saying this on the same lines, if the Shiv Sena takes the Congress along, it will prepare the way for the Congress to return to the state's politics
 bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko paarit nahin hone dene or iske tahat ek inch bhi jameen nahin dene ke congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bayaan par bijepi ne somvaar ko palatwaar kiya
 Priyanka was also named on behalf of BJP
 Rahul probably means that he will not even give 'one inch' of his brother-in-law Robert Vadra and sister Priyanka Gandhi's land in Himachal Pradesh in Rajasthan and Haryana, acquired through irregularities
 
 rahul ko kaha bacchabijepi ke pravaktaa emje akbar ne ek bhi inch jameen nahin dene ke rahul ke bayaan par kaha, ‘congress ke paas kehane ke liye jab kuch nahin hota, tabhi bhatka bacchachillaataahe

 Himachal Pradesh will not give even an inch of her sister Priyanka Gandhi's land

 Everyone has different opinions

 com / chunkmztfz a violent encounter between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party took place at the BJP headquarters at 11, Ashok Road, New Delhi on Wednesday
 lakhanu or uttar pradesh ke kuch duusare hisson se bhi bijepi or aap ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich hinsak jhadpon kii khabaren ain
 Late in the night, the leaders of both parties appealed to their workers to maintain peace
 aam aadmi party kii nai kism kii raajnneeti is kshetra ke sthapit khilaadiyon ke liye ek badi chunauti pesh kar rahi he
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Delhi Assembly elections, but the government was formed by Arvind Kejriwal's party with the support of the Congress
 dharne or andolan ke boote dilli kii raajnneeti main apni jagah banane vaali is nai party ne bijepi ke paramparaagat samarthak madhya varg or congress ke garib or dalit vot main send lagaai
 a large number of government employees also voted for this party
 49 din kii sarkaar main kejariwal ne jahaan ek ore janhit main tabadatod faisle kiye, vahiin unke swayan ke or kuch mantriyon ke ravaiye ke kaaran sarkaar kii chhavi kuch is tarah kii bani ki ve sarkaar chalaane ke liye gambhir nahin hai
 Analysts believe that Lok Sabha elections are a priority for the Aam Aadmi Party, so when Kejriwal felt that he had tied up here by forming a half-baked government in Delhi, he sacrificed his government in the name of Jan Lokpal
 iske baad se hi kejariwal loksabhaa chunaav ke liye lagaataar apana agenda spasht kar rahe hai
 His attack is on industrialist Mukesh Ambani and by his name he is constantly attacking Congress and BJP
 kejariwal saikadon baar kah chuke hai ki mukesh ambani se rahul gandhi or narendra modi mili hue hai
 But now gradually his attack is becoming less on Rahul and more on Narendra Modi
 upi main kejariwal ke road sho ke dauraan hi unki party kii ore se sanket diya gaya ki agar narendra modi banaras se chunaav ladate hai, to kejariwal unke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utar sakate hai
 Sometimes Kejriwal talks about Modi's air in the country, sometimes he says that the air has been created by TV channel people
 kanpur main unhone elaan kiya ki gujarat ke vikaas kii hakeekat jaanane ke liye vah vahaan kaa daura karenge
 Meanwhile, in response to his alleged detention, Aam Aadmi Party activists staged violent demonstrations at BJP offices in many places including Delhi
 bijepi kii javaabi pratikriya bhi hi utani hi tikhi or hinsak rahi
 The party responded to the brick with stone
 lakhanu main to bhartiya janata yuva morche ke kaaryakartaaon ne aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ko sadak par dauda-dauda kar peeta
 In fact, in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, BJP was eliminated from those big cities of the country, where traditionally BJP has been getting support
 in shaharon main madhya varg ne aarthik sankat kaa safaltaapurvak muqabla karne ke liye upie or manmohan singh ko apana samarthan diya
 This middle class did not express its faith under the leadership of LK Advani
 lekin pichley paanch saal main halaat badale hai
 Issues like inflation, corruption, falling growth rate, rising unemployment have created tremendous anger against the Congress within this middle class
 bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye janalokapal ko lekar dilli main hue anna hajaare or india anguest karpshan ke janandolanon ne sarkaar kii chulein hilaa deen or isi se aam aadmi party kaa janm hua
 This was the reason that when the assembly elections of five states including Delhi were held in november-december 2013, BJP had high expectations from them
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main uski ye ummiden puri huin
 But the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi dashed his hopes
 dilli ke logon ne congress ke khilaaf gussa to dikhaaya, magar iskaa zyada phayda bijepi ke bajaae aam aadmi party le gai
 The BJP was also shocked because it used its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi fiercely in the assembly elections
 ab jabaki loksabhaa ke chunaavon kii ghoshnaa ho chuki he, aam aadmi party rupi sirdard phir bijepi ko pareshaan kar rahaa he
 It is different that all the opinion polls till now are talking about overwhelming support in favor of Modi across the country, but in one part of the media, Arvind Kejriwal is shown with Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi among the prime ministerial contenders
 is
 media main mil rahe is samarthan se kejariwal kaaphi utsahit hai
 The BJP feels that the angry vote from the Congress does not go to the Aam Aadmi Party in other big cities of the country, like Delhi, in which the result can be affected if the votes are divided
 bijepi or uski sahyogi shivasena ke saath aisa pichley loksabhaa chunaav main mumbai main hua tha, jahaan raaj thakare kii party ne unke vot katkar congress ko phayda pahunchaaya tha
 Since Kejriwal's party is a new player in the electoral game, nothing can be guessed about his performance
 baharhaal, nattejey jo bhi aaen, buudhvaar ko donon partiyon ke bich sadakon par jo yuddh hua, vah loktantr ke liye kisi bhi tarah se shubh nahin he
 The battle for votes will not be liked by the middle class, whose BJP and Aam Aadmi Party both need votes

 In June 1984, the army took military action to free the temple complex from terrorists
 'gurudwara sant khalsa' naamak yah gurudwara moga jile ke baghapurana anumandal ke rhode-laande gaanv main usee sthaan par banaaya gaya he jahaan bhindranvaale kaa pushtaini ghar hua karata tha
 The gurudwara was opened to the public on 14 February
 bhale hi anjaan hone kaa dam bhar len lekin sambhaavna yahi he ki pichhali shiad-bhaajapa sarkaar or uske baad congress sarkaar, donon ne ise jaan-boojhkar andekha kiya he kyonki smarak ke nirmaan kaa kaary ek dashak se adhik samay tak chalaa he
 The house was turned into ruins after Bhindranwale's siblings and other relatives left the ancestral home in the village of rhode-lande years ago
 bhindranvaale ke kattar samarthak algaavvaadi dal khalsa ke pravaktaa kanvarpal singh kehete hai, ''unke beton tak ko is gaanv main rahanaa manjuur na hua
 "interestingly, the construction work went on in memory of the person whose views were officially banned by India by declaring them as 'separatists' and 'extremists' and no tone of protest emerged

 However, Kanwarpal insists, "the case of Bhindranwale and the terror that spread after the incident of 1984" are both separate cases
 '' hairat nahin yadi dilli or chandigarh main baithi sarkarein dekhati rah jaaen or dal khalsa ke logon ke man main varshon se chal rahi kai anya smarakon kii yojanaayen puri ho jaaen

 *** Shivaji's descendants need reservation in education and employment for their caste
 yah maang rajya main rajnatik sameekaran ko badal sakati he
 Just last April 4, Sambhaji Raje, a thirteenth-generation descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, undertook a five-km trek from Byculla to Azad Maidan in southern Mumbai and addressed reservations to one lakh people, demanding reservation in education and employment for the Marathas
 rajya main rajnatik sameekaran ko badalane kii kshamta rakhane vaale ahm masale par mumbai main yah pehali badi raily thi
 At the end of the rally, Sambhaji was ceremonially 'anointed' as the leader of the Maratha caste and its organizations present in the state
 rajnatik rup se khaase taqatvar or rajya kii 11
 Reservation is an emotional issue for the Marathas who claim 40 per cent of the 2 crore population
 bharat main jati aadhaarit aarakshan sabase pehle shuru karne kaa shrey isi rajvansh ke shahuji maharaj ko he
 Sambhaji, a 42-year-old descendant of the royal dynasty of Kolhapur, wants the government to include the Marathas into other backward castes (obcs)
 maraathon ko ab tak oonchi jati kaa kshatriya mana jaataa rahaa he
 Raje believes that this move will hurt the reputation of Marathas, but he claims that it will benefit millions of Marathas, who do not provide good education to their children and who do not get government jobs
 kolhapur sthit 200 acre main faile 125 baras puraane apane mahal ke aaleeshaan atithi grih main safed sofe par baithe raaje kehete hai, ‘main hinsak rasta apnaane kii bajaae dabaav banane main yakeen rakhata hum

 teen maheene pehle unka vajan puure 89 kilo tha, jise badi mehnat se unhone 13 kilo kam kiya he taaki aage aane vaali siyaasi jang ke liye ve khud ko taiyaar rakh saken
 Marathas claim that 11 of Maharashtra
 2 karod kii aabaadi main ve 40 fisadi hai
 Of the total 350 mlas (legislative Assembly and Legislative Council) of the state, 200 are Marathas
 kah sakate hai ki unka agenda bahut maheen kism kaa he-ve rajnatik aarakshan ke paksh main nahin hai kyonki vidhansabha main to pehle se hi maratha pratinidhitiv paryaapt he
 Out of a total of 350 legislators of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, 200 are Marathas
 ve aarthik aadhaar par bhi aarakshan ke khilaaf hai kyonki ise court main chunauti mil sakati he
 From India Today, he says, 'I am demanding Marathas to be included in the OBC category
 hamen apni pichhali chamakdaar viraasat kii khushrahmi or ek shreshth jati se aane ke dambh se mukt hokar apane bich ke garibon ke phaayde par sochna hoga
 'sambhaji Raje's inclusive politics can also replace the traditional Marathi politics of hatred against Brahmins
 brahman rajya main ek or prabhutvshaalee jati he, jo kul aabaadi kaa 3
 5 percent
 maratha seva sangh or sambhaji brigade jaise samooh brahmanon kii sansthaaon par lagaataar hamale karte aae hai
 He has been accused that Brahmins "corrupt people's minds"
 ’ yah bhi ki is sandarbh main brahman har baar shivaji ke guru ke rup main do aitihaasik brahman vyaktitvon ko pesh karte hai-samarth ramdaas swami or dadoji konddev
 Raje is strongly opposed to the politics of hate, 'my ancestor Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj gave the highest donation to the Deccan Education Society, a Brahmin institution in Pune
 mujhase to logon ko unase bhi zyada ummiden hai
 i do not believe in criticism of other castes and religions
 ’raaje sabase pehle surkhiyon main us vakt aae the, jab unhone chah saal pehle maraathon kii aitihaasik rajdhani raigarh ke kile main shivaji kii 150 kilo kii ek pratimaa pahunchaai thi
 When the Archaeological Survey of India refused to place this statue there, Raje again persuaded the state government for it
 unhone daleel di ki yahi vah jagah thi, jahaan shivaji apana darbar lagaaya karte the
 Raje has been touring the state continuously since then and has been demanding that five other forts of Shivaji be repaired
 ve saaf kehete hai, ‘main raajnneeti main nahin rahanaa chahta
 But it takes my mind to repair the forts
 ’vidarbha, marathavada or uttari maharashtra ke daure ke baad unhen laga ki maraathon ke aarakshan kii aawaaj unhen uthaani chahie
 He says, 'most of the farmers who committed suicide in Vidarbha were poor Marathas
 marathavada or uttari maharashtra main kareeb-kareeb ek jaisi sthitiyaan hai
 There is no doubt that the Marathas are well represented in the Vidhan Sabha, but because of this their economic and educational status has not improved even a bit
 ’vaise unke is kadam ko lekar obisi netaaon main andeshaa he
 Maharashtra OBC Sanghatna vice-president Shravan Devare believes that if the Marathas are included in the OBC category, the OBC quota will be split
 devare ke shabdon main, ‘bombai hycourt ne apane chaar faislon main saaf taur par kaha he ki maraathon ko obisi main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 'maharashtra already has this figure at 52 per cent as against the 50 per cent cap set by the Supreme Court for caste-based reservation
 raaje ke samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki rajya ko yah seemaa or badhaane kii ijaajat mil jaaegi, jaisaa ki andhra pradesh or karnataka main hua he
 Reservation limits in these two states are 75 and 61 per cent respectively
 haalanki inhen lekar mukademebaaji bhi he
 The state government has formed a committee under the chairmanship of Industries Minister Narayan Rane, who is discussing the issue of reservation for Marathas
 cameti agar koi ‘upyukt’ faisla nahin kar paati he, to congress or ensipi ke paaramparik votbank main sendhamari kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa he
 On 4 April at the Maratha Reservation Rally, angry people present at Azad Maidan rejected the initiative of Raje to approach Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and submit a memorandum of demands
 unka maananaa tha ki ek chhatrapati (raja) ke kabhi kisi sarkaar ke paas jaakar kisi bhi tarah kii guzarish rakhane kii koi misaal nahin milti
 Raje says, 'people wanted the Chief Minister to come there himself and listen to me what i wanted to say
 mukhyamantri ke vahaan na aane kii sthiti main vidhansabha tak padayatra karne kii vahaan logon kii taiyaari thi
 i did not approve any such plan

 ajam ne sahityakaron ke bare main kaha, 'ham unhen salaam karnaa chaahate hai
 Want to tell them that this sacrifice has given life to millions of people of the country
 ' ajam ne shivasena par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki party ke mansoobey thik nahin hai
 Azam also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the controversial statement made on the beef of the Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on the pretext of Modi on the pretext of Khattar
 unhone kaha, 'ham piem se kahana chaahate hai ki unki party ne hindustan main rahane vaale tamaam alpsankhyakon ko bhaybheet kar rakhaa he
 The British, led by Mahatma Gandhi, were asked to leave India

 com / ckzjkeeba9 Let us know that since the bjp's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections, there were speculations about Amit Shah joining the cabinet
 haalankibijapi keek dhade kaa maananaa tha kiamit shah ko philhal bijepi adhyaksh ke pad se hataanaa sahi nahin hoga
 Especially when Assembly elections are due in Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Delhi in the next few months
 rajya sabha main apni sthiti ko or behatar karne ke liye bijepi ko vidhansabha chunaav main bhi behatar karnaa jaruri he
 At present NDA has 99 members out of 250 members of Rajya Sabha
 haalanki amit shah nai cabinet kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 The fasting of ex-servicemen at Jantar Mantar in Delhi has come for 21 days to demand the implementation of 'one Rank One Pension' in the army, but hunger strike is yet to be seen
 haa, itnaa jarur hua he ki guuruuvaar ko rakshaamantri manohar parrikar se mulaakaat ke baad in purv sainikon ko ummid bandhi he ki aane vaale do chaar dinon main koi rasta nikal aayega
 By the way, these soldiers have already made it clear that there will be no agreement on the definition of One Rank One Pension in Parliament and unless the government declares the deadline, then the nationwide demonstration with Jantar Mantar will continue
 tippaniyan Captain Darshan Singh, who rescued Pakistan's sixes in 1965 and 1971 on behalf of the army, says that it is a shame for the government that its soldiers are sitting on a road strike demanding their demand, but what can we do, other than this Is not vaise sarkaar ab is dharne ko jald se jald khatm karne kii firaaq main he, taaki kisaan ke saath jawan virdohi jo uski chhavi ban rahi he usase bachaa ja sake
 It is likely that on Monday or Tuesday, the defense minister will again meet with a group of ex-soldiers and they will be able to give them some solid confidence
 vaise in sainikon ne pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki van rank van pension ko lekar jo sansad main paribhaasha di gai he us par koi samjhauta nahin hoga or jab tak sarkaar dedline kaa elaan nahin karegi, tab tak jantar mantar ke saath deshbhar main pradarshan jari rahegaa
 The comments sena kii ore se 1965 or 1971 main pakistan ke chakke chhudaane vaale captain darshan singh kehete hai ki ye sarkaar ke liye shame kii baat he ki uske sipaahi apni maang ko lekar sadak par hadtaal karne baithe hai, lekin ham kya karen iske sivaay koi chaara bhi nahi he
 However, the government is now looking to end this dharna at the earliest, so that the anti-jawan with the farmer who is becoming his image can be avoided
 sambhaavna yah he ki somvaar yaa mangalvaar ko phir se rakshaamantri kii purv sainikon ke dal se mulaakaat hogi or ve inhen koi thos bharosa de sakenge

 kashmir main algaavvaadi sanghathan ko lekar ab tak kadaa rukh apana rahi centre sarkaar ne you-turn le liya he
 The government, which has so far stopped the talks and talks of separatists with Pakistani leaders, is now giving it the green signal

 Due to this, they can meet and talk to the representative of any country
 ''PAK se baatcheet main third party kaa role nahin'jawaab main wike singh ne yah bhi spasht kiya he ki bharat-pakistan ke bich baatcheet main kisi tisare paksh ko nahin laayaa jayega
 He said, 'india is still firm on the fact that the third party will not play a role in talks with Pakistan
 jaisaa ki shimla samjhaute or lahore main hui ghoshnaa main bhi kaha gaya he
 Talk was canceled due to Hurriyat
 In August 2014, before the talks of the Foreign Secretary level, the Modi government turned down the demand of meeting Pakistan's separatist leaders and later the talks were also canceled
 agast 2015 main pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (NSA) ko bharat aana tha, lekin usase dilli main maujuud pakistani hai kamishnar ne kashmiri algaavvaadi netaaon se baatcheet kii jiske baad bharat ne baatcheet radd kar di thi
 At that time, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had said that Pakistan should choose either India or one of the separatist leaders
 isliye palati modi sarkaaiylgaavvaadi sanghathanhurriyat kii gatividhiyonko lekar modi sarkaar lagaataar kadaa rukh apanaati dikhi he, lekin bangkok main bharat-pakistan ke enese kii mulaakaat ke baad suraksha or aatankwaad jaise muddon par baatcheet kii ummid jaagi thi
 It also became clear that the government is making its way difficult by banning Hurriyat from meeting Pakistani leaders
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi ke baad yah faisla liya gaya
 On March 23 this year, Hurriyat leaders were present at the Pakistan High Commission on the occasion of Pakistan Day

 On Wednesday, India showed strict attitude, saying on Wednesday that it had enough evidence that the Pakistani Army had a hand in this barbaric, brutal and inhuman incident
 iske saath hi bharat ne iske liye jimmedaar sainikon evam cmanderon ke khilaaf karrwai karne ko kaha
 Outraged by this incident, India summoned Pakistan's High Commissioner Abdul Basit and shared the evidence of the incident with the Pakistani High Commissioner

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party ne soobe kii 71 siten jitkar centre main sarkaar banaai thi
 This was the first time after 28 years that a party had got a clear majority
 upi main bijepi ko chauthe paaydaan se pehle number kii party banane main jahaan ek ore narendra modi kaa karishma kaam kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, the strategy of the then party in-charge of UP, Amit Shah, also proved very effective
 modi kii tarah amit shah kaa bhi grih rajya gujarat he
 In order to repeat the results like 2014 in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the same responsibility has once again been handed over to the party leader Govardhan Zadaphia, who hails from Gujarat
 unhen buudhvaar ko upi ke bijepi prabharee banaaya gaya he
 During the riots, Gujarat's Home Minister was Govardhan Zadaphia
 Interestingly, Amit Shah was the Home Minister when Narendra Modi was CM in Gujarat
 jabaki shah se pehle modi sarkaar main gujarat ke grahamantri kii jimmedaari govardhan jhadfia ne haathon main thi
 Gujraj riots took place in the year 2002 when Zadaphia was the Home Minister
 2002 ke baad hi jhadfia said line ho gaye or baad main 2005 unhone party chhod di
 He formed the Gujarat Parivartan Party with Keshubhai Patel, but did not achieve much success
 keshubhai ke saath bijepi se alag ho gaye thehaalanki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad keshubhai or govardhan jhadfia ne milakar jis gujarat parivartan party ko banaaya tha use bijepi main marz kar diya
 Zadaphia has been active in the organization since her return to the BJP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle govardhan jhadfia ko uttar pradesh kaa prabharee banaakar bijepi ne unhen badi jimmedaari saunpi he
 At the same time, there seems to be an alliance between the SP-BSP in the state
 yahi vajah he ki jhadfia soobe kii kaman bijepi ne bahut soch samajhakar di he
 Started from ABVP, Safdarzafia comes from the Patidar (patel) community of Gujarat and he started his political journey through Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad
 unhone sanjay joshi jaise netaaon ke saath sanghathan main kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, he had also made a mark as a farmer leader
 isse saaf samajha ja saktaa he ki jhadfia upi main jaateey sameekaran ko saadhane ke saath-saath sanghathan ko majboot karne main ahm role adaa kar sakate hai
 The society from which Zadaphia comes comes under the OBC in UP
 upi main kurmi samaaj kii aabaadi kareeb 5 fisadi he
 The SP-BSP combine is trying to help them
 is sameekaran ko apane paksh main karne kii badi chunauti jhadfia ke upar hogi
 This time there will be a fire test, during the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections, BJP had given responsibility to Zadafia for cutting of Hardik Patel's Patidar movement
 iskaa nateeja tha ki bijepi kii ek baar satta main vaapasi hui
 Although some seats have definitely reduced
 aise hi upi ke vidhansabha chunaav main unhen soobe ke kisaanon ko saadhane kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 He was successful in this
 iske baad unki agali agnipariksha 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main honi he
 It remains to be seen whether he will be able to repeat the results during Shah

 bijepi in chote dalon ke kor voters ko ekamusth apni taraf laane kii koshishon main juty he
 It is being said that the BJP believes that the Kurmi votes cannot be brought to their court by being soft towards the allied party - Apna Dal
 iske liye yojanabaddh tareeke se kaam karnaa hoga
 This is the reason that Anupriya Patel's leaf was cleared in the first Modi government and now her husband Ashish Patel did not find a place in the Yogi government's cabinet expansion
 mana ja rahaa he ki 2017 ke vidhansabha or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi jatiyon se mili vyapak janaadhar se utsahit bijepi ab duusare dalon ke liye gunjaaish chhodane ke mood main nahin hai
 This is the reason why after Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, the BJP has made bets to keep Apna Dal's core voters in the court
 haalanki bijepi ke netaa chote dalon kii jameen khinchne kii kisi yojana se inkaar karte hai
 He says that this is a natural process of party expansion
 jahaan gunjaaish dikhegi vahiin party khud ko or apane netaa ko majboot karegi
 However, the BJP leaders of UP also talk of having a smooth relationship with Apna Dal as before
 anupriya ke jile main bijepi ne patel netaa ko kiya majbootakahaan to anupriya patel apane pati or apana dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ashish patel ko yogi sarkaar main mantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahatin thim
 Before the expansion of the Council of Ministers, Apna Dal workers were making very confident claims about Ashish Patel becoming a minister, but nothing like this happened
 bijepi ne ashish patel kii jagah mirzapur ke madihaan se apane vidhayak ramashankar patel ko mantri banaakar or majboot karne kaa kaam kiya
 Political analysts believe that the BJP has a big plan to strengthen a Patel leader by giving him a ministerial berth in his 'house'
 yah ek prakaar se anupriya patel parivaar ke samanaantar duusare patel netaa ko ubhaarne kii bijepi kii koshish he
 The message is clear that the BJP is not giving its party and Anupriya a price
 bijepi patel voton ke liye ab anupriya patel ke bharose nahin rahane vaali
 In fact, Anupriya Patel was made the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in the first innings of the Modi government
 magar, modi sarkaar kii duusari pari main anupriya patel ko mantriparishad main jagah nahin di gai
 After this, it was believed that instead of this, BJP would give her husband and Apna Dal national president Ashish Patel a place in the Yogi government
 ashish patel chunki emelsi hai, to mana ja rahaa tha ki unhen rajya main mantri banane ke liye hi bijepi ne emelsi banaaya he
 But during the expansion of the Council of Ministers on Wednesday, Ashish's name disappeared from the list of ministers
 apana dal se berukhi kii vajahakhir anupriya patel parivaar se bijepi kii berukhi kii vajah kya he? saansad hone par na anupriya patel ko modi sarkaar main jagah mili or na hi emelsi hone par pati ashish ko yogi sarkaar main mantri banane kaa mauka mila
 The reason behind this was Anupriya Patel's treatment of BJP during the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi sutara bataate hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan anupriya patel siton ke mol-bhav par utar ai thim
 There were also reports of his Priyanka Gandhi being in touch
 chunki us vakt chunaav kaa mauka tha to bijepi khamosh thi
 The party felt that the Kurmi votes might have to be lost due to any kind of reaction
 magar loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad bhi upi main bijepi 65 siten jeetne main safal rahi or lagbhag sabhi jatiyon main party sendhamari karne main safal rahi to phir party ne anupriya patel ko bhav dena band kar diya
 As the BJP emerged stronger than 2014 in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Anupriya Patel also felt that it was better to stay with the BJP, a loss in becoming a rebel
 vajah ki bijepi se muthbhed lene par anupriya patel ko party main tut kaa bhi khatra mandaraane laga
 Apna Dal has nine mlas and two mps
 jisamen ek saansad khud anupriya patel bhi hai
 BJP has broken many smaller parties in the past
 aise main sutara bataa rahe hai ki centre or rajya donon sarkaron main pratinidhitiv na milane par bhi anupriya patel kii bijepi ke saath rahane kii majaburi he
 BJPBJP, which had already weakened Rajbhar, had aligned with Om Prakash Rajbhar's Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (subhaspa) ahead of the 2017 assembly elections for Rajbhar votes in Uttar Pradesh
 purvanchal main kai siton par rajbhar matadaata nirnaayak sabit hote hai
 BJP got the benefit of the alliance
 nateeja rahaa ki yogi sarkaar main om prakaash rajbhar cabinet mantri bane
 But the BJP gradually started strengthening MLA Anil Rajbhar from Shivpuri seat of Banaras
 ise om prakaash rajbhar ne chunauti ke rup main liya
 Om Prakash Rajbhar also started negotiating seats during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin bijepi ke khilaaf bayaanbaji bhi karne lage
 The party remained silent till the vote
 magar matdaan hone ke baad or nattejey aane se ek hafte pehle om prakaash rajbhar ko yogi ne barkhaast kar diya
 After which CM Yogi handed over Anil Rajbhar to his Backward Classes Department
 ab jaakar bijepi ne anil rajbhar ko cabinet mantri ke taur par pramot kiya he
 It is believed that by strengthening Anil Rajbhar, BJP wants to send a message to Rajbhars that Om Prakash is a more powerful leader than Rajbhar in his caste
 kurmi voton ke liye or bhi daanvbijepi ne kurmi voton ke liye kai daanv chale hai
 For example, where Ramashankar Patel was made a minister
 vahiin isse pehle kurmi jati se hi naata rakhane vaale swatantradev ko party ne pradesh adhyaksh banaaya he
 At the same time, Anandiben Patel has been made the governor
 sutara bataate hai ki isse rajya main kurmi matadaataaon main sandesh gaya he ki unki jati ke logon ko bijepi acha pratinidhitiv de rahi he

 Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said that the government has received the report today
 samvedansheel masalaa he
 There are different views
 adhyayan ke liye kuch samay dijie
 Jitendra Singh said that there was a holiday in the middle, so the government got only four to five days
 upiessi kaa imtahaan taalna maamuli faisla nahin he
 Doing this at the last minute could also lead to the tampering of a constitutional body like the UPSC, but even during the time of the previous government many provisions of the UPSC were changed after political opposition
 dikkat yah he ki vipaksh ke alaava sarkaar ke mantri yaa sarkaar ke dal ke saansadon ne shuru main is andolan ko samarthan diya, jisase ummidavaaron ko bharosa hua ki sarkaar unki maang se praathmik rup se sahamat he or kuch karegi
 Trust is weakening over time
 dharne par baithe chaatro kii pitayee or uthaai kii khabaren mil rahi hai
 Violent confrontation also occurred
 magar inaki pitayee kii khabaron ko lekar angreji media ne dangai likhaa to soshal media par inke andolan ko shantipurna bataaya gaya
 Such pictures were released, in which the students' heads are torn
 sarkaar to do-chaar maukon par hindi bolkar hindi kii champion ho gai, magar apni bhashaa main pratibha kaa parichay dene kii maang karne vaale in chaatro ko hindi medium yani doum darje kaa branded kar diya gaya
 There may be many sides to the demand of these students and it may not be that their demand can be sustained on technical grounds, but the way they have been beaten up and the major part of society, government and opposition has been silent, it tells that we How sensitive are linguistic students
 si-sat virdohi andolan main shariq jatin maanate hai ki isse sirf angreji or technical chaatro ko laabh mil rahaa he
 Ankit is in favor of C-SAT
 kehete hai ki videsh seva main bina angreji ke duniya ke manch par kaise baat rakhenge? vaise bhi yah bhashaa kii jaanch karne vaala imtahaan nahin he
 Aptitude test
 fasebuk par kisi ne likh diya ki is lihaaz se pradhanmantri ke liye bhi angreji anivaary ho jaae
 a plea was found on the bbc's site that why should students who take the exam in English medium answer ten per cent of the questions in any regional language from which they come
 vaise tathy yah he ki iees banane ke baad jis rajya main tainaati hoti he, vahaan kii bhashaa seekhni padati he
 English can also be learned or learned later from this argument
 hamen daleel or batakuchchan main fark samajhnaa hoga
 In this case, i would like to bring the article of IAS officer Shrivats Krishna in the Times of India and Anita Joshua's report in The Hindu also for reference
 shrivats ne likhaa he ki kya koi iaiti, im yaa jimat parikshaon ke liye aisi maang karne kaa saahas karegaa
 a common platform has to be created for all subjects for the All India Examination
 bharat or uski sansthaaen global ho rahi hai
 C-SAT emphasizes the ability to analyze instead of rote learning and test basic English
 agar koi dasvin kaksha kaa ganit yaa angreji kaa parchaa hal nahin kar saktaa to use iees nahin bananaa chahie
 The intrigue that is being spoken against Hindi applies to every examination
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he
 Well in Hindu Anita Joshua has put forward other arguments
 iskaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum taaki andolankaaree chaatro ke samanaantar or bhi daleelein aa saken
 Anita's analysis reveals that 29 of rural backgrounds in 2010 examination
 3 pratishat ummidavaar chune gaye the, jo 2011 main ghatakar 27
 Turned 13
 magar yah kahana sahi nahin he ki si-sat ke kaaran hua
 The decline in rural candidates has also started in the old format
 lihaaza iske kaaran kahin or hai, si-sat main nahin
 In 2011, the number of students who opted for essay in Hindi in Mains was 1682, while in 2012 it was 1956
 bad hi gai
 The same has been seen in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu
 main apni charchaa ko is vivaad ke sandarbh main ghatiya anuwaad ke aas-paas nahin rakhana chahta
 Many things have been done
 kya ham is sawaal ko raajnneetik najariye se dekh sakate hai ki jab koi pradhanmantri china ke saamne hindi bolkar desh ke liye raajnneetik aatmavishvaas kaa pradarshan kar saktaa he to angreji kii taraf jhuki ja rahi hamaari parikshaon ko bhartiya bhashaaon kii taraf kyon nahin modaa ja saktaa
 It should also be kept in mind that in the last two decades there has been a proliferation of English media schools across the country
 har koi english medium skool main daalana chahta he
 We do not have a complete scale of inquiry that talent can only be in villages and local languages

 Published in Hindi and English from Rajkamal Prakashan in 2013, this book has been in discussion since the beginning
 yah duniya main ek anoothaa prayaas rahaa, jisamen tihaad jail kii mahila karagaar number 6 main kaid mahila kaidiyon ko kavita lekhan ke liye prerit kiya gaya or baad main chaar mahila kaidiyon ( rama chouhan, seemaa raghuvanshi, riya sharma or aarti) kii kavitaaon kaa sankalan chapa gaya
 All the color photographs printed in this book have been taken by the prisoners themselves
 ek vishesh anumati ke baad unhen kuch ghanton ke liye ek camera diya gaya tha, jisase ve apni jindagi kii tasviren khud len
 This book has also been printed differently
 kitaab ko kholane par shabd nahin, sirf tasviren dikhaai detii hai maano yah tasveeron kii kitaab he
 Actually all the pages are linked with each other
 unhen alag karne par hi milti he- kavita
 Numerous experiments have been done continuously with this book and songs
 vartika nanda or vimala mehara ne patrakarita or jansanchaar ke vividh madhyamon se aparaadh kii taraf dhyaan dilaane kii koshish kii he
 The song written by him and Vimala Mehra- 'tinka tinka tihar


' has become the identity of Tihar Jail
 limca book of records main apni pustak ‘tinkaa tinkaa tihaad’ shaamil hone par khushi jaahir karte hue dow
 Vartika Nanda says, 'A woman's leave and tears should not be taken lightly
 sambhav he saamaajik drushti se yah tinkaa hi najar aae, lekin dhyaan rahe in tinakon ko bhi bahut kuch kahana hota he
 Keeping this context in mind, we conducted successful experiments on women in Tihar
 is tarah ke prayog aage bhi jari rahenge
 On the other hand, Vimala Mehra also expressed his happiness saying, 'we in Tihar Jail had done a unique experiment in terms of women empowerment
 is prayog se jail main band mahilaon kii srujanshiltaa ko baahar laane main safal rahe
 This boosted his confidence, gave a new identity to his talent
 is tarah ke prayog hote rahane chahie
 On this achievement, Ashok Maheshwari, managing director of Rajkamal Publication Group, while wishing the two editors of the book said, 'our publishing group has always been giving place to such innovations and will continue to do so
 is kitaab main jin chaar mahila kaidiyon ne apni srujanaatmak kshamtaaon ko udaan di he, use ham badhaava dena chaahate the
 Now society has to think how can these creative women in captivity be helped
 ' One of the rare cases in the Navy has occurred
 darasal, ek sevarat nausena kaa navik sex punargathan surgery karwaakar mahila ban gaya he
 Now her discharge from the Navy will begin, as women cannot serve as soldiers in the defense services
 yah maamla ek aise samay main ubhara he jab sashastr bal ladaaku bhoomikaaon main mahilaon ke shaamil hone or sevaaon main mahilaon ko vyapak jimmedaari dene ke liye ek vyapak niti taiyaar karne kii sambandhit jatiltaaon se jujh rahe hai
 a senior Navy source told Mail Today that a few months ago, the sailor decided to change her sex and became a woman
 vah kuch bahari logon ke sampark main aayaa or oparation karwaane kaa faisla kiya
 She herself spent her money to become a woman
 vishakhapatnam main nausena ke ienes eksala base main tainaat ye navik ab sari pahentaa he or bal badha rahaa he
 Sources say that we have recommended his leave from service and action has been initiated in this regard and he will be leaving soon
 nausena ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki jab tak ki navik ko sena se chuttee nahin milti he, tab tak use halki jimmedaariyaan saunpi jaaengin kyonki mahilaon se mallaah kaa kaam nahin karaayaa ja saktaa, kyonki abhi tak isaki anumati nahin he
 Officials said the sailor said that he felt 'like a woman trapped in a man's body', so he made the decision
 uske sutron ke anusaar, vah nausena ke faisle se khush he ki use seva se baahar kar diya jayega
 Sources said the sailor was married before the sex change operation
 maamla raksha mantralay ke saath bhi uthaaya gaya he kyonki yah ek abhootpurv sthiti he
