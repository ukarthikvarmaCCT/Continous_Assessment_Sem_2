 Along with dealing with the devastation caused by tsunamis and earthquakes, Japan will also have to deal with the nuclear threat, as the whole world is apprehensive of the way all the attempts to frost the reactor in the last three days have failed

 Indian team bowling coach Bharat Arun reacted to the Sri Lankan players stopping the game thrice due to pollution on the second day of the third Test match being played at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on Sunday, saying that the attention of the visiting team players may be on pollution Was, not on the match
 din ke duusare satr main srilanka ke takreeban paanch se zyada khilaadi maidan par pradooshan ke kaaran mask lagaakar utre the
 Bharat said that Virat batted for almost two days but he did not wear a mask
 bharat se jab poocha gaya ki kya srilankai khilaadiyon kaa teen baar match rokane kaa makasad bhartiya khilaadiyon kii lay ko todna tha?is par bharat ne kaha, vah shaayad pradooshan par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chaahate the
 His attention was probably elsewhere
 ho saktaa he ki isse hamaari lay tuuti ho
 At that time when the match was stopped, we wanted to continue the match
 din ke duusare satr main bharat jab paanch wicket khokar 509 ranon par tha tabhi srilankai gendbaaj lahiru gamage ko pareshaani hui or khelaa roka gaya
 Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan players complained about the poor environment to the on-field umpires
 jiske kaaran takreeban 15 minute kaa khel rukaa
 The match resumed and Ravichandran Ashwin (4) fell

 The match resumed once the game was halted for five minutes, but five balls later Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal stopped the match due to having 10 players and meanwhile, coach of the Sri Lankan team Nick Pothas came to the ground to talk to the umpires
 isi bich bhartiya dressing room se kohli ne pareshaan hokar pari ghoshit kar di
 Bharat said that it is not right to contradict players like this on the field because the umpires and referees there pay attention to every situation in the match
 unhone kaha
 For an umpire on the field and a match referee, this is the issue
 khilaadiyon kaa kaam jaakar virodh pradarshan karnaa nahin he
 When the game was stopped without any reason, we wanted the match to continue
 kyonki hamaara dhyaan is test match par he or ham ise jeetna chaahate hai
 On what happened to Shastri's umpires on the field, the bowling coach said, Ravi had clearly said not to stop the match to continue
 mehmaan team ke khilaadiyon ke mask pahanane par bharat ne kaha, viraat ne do din tak ballebaaji kii unhen mask kii jarurat nahin padi
 Our focus was on what we wanted to do
 ham ek team ke taur par kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai is par puri tarah se hamaara dhyaan tha
 The circumstances were the same for both teams
 srilankai team ke ravaiye se pareshaan hokar bharat ne apni pari ghoshit kar di thi
 Bharat said on this
 ek tareeke se nahin kyonki ham 550 ke score par dhyaan de rahe the, or iske aasapaas kaa score hamane bana liya tha to hamane sochaa kii hamen pari ghoshit kar deni chahie

 baalkrishna ne kaha ki unhen apana passport lekar uttarakhand ucch nyaayalay ke saamne jamaa karnaa he or isliye vah pesh nahin ho sakate
 Balakrishna, who appeared before the CBI on Wednesday, sent a fax to the officials, saying that he had to submit his travel documents on Friday as per the court order and he was busy taking his documents
 haalanki unhone yah nahin bataaya ki unhen apana passport kahaan se lenaa he
 Balkrishna had earlier claimed that he had submitted his passport to the British High Commission to get a visa
 baalkrishna se passport lene ke liye kathith taur par farji dastavejon ke istemaal se jude maamle main kai sawaal puche gaye the, lekin vah unhen taal gaye

 aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne apane do dinon ke asafal andolan main kaaphi kuch kho diya
 His fierce and obstinate attitude did not appeal to the citizens like common peace
 teen police karmiyon ke nilamban ko lekar vah jis bachakaani jid kii had tak chale gaye uski misaal nahin milti
 The way he declared himself to be chaotic and unknown, it seemed that he had forgotten the common courtesy of democracy
 lakhon logon ko bulaakar rajpath ko bhar dene kaa unka daawa unke ahankaar kaa ek namoona bhar tha
 He probably has no idea how much trouble was caused by this movement of his party for the common man for two days, and in this whole process a large section of his sympathizers got away because they wanted to get rid of their troubles but they Trouble increased
 baharhaal yah andolan ek chote se aashwaasan ke baad khatm ho gaya he or dilli waalon kii jindagi phir se patari par aa gai he
 But it raised many questions
 sabase bada sawaal to yah uthaa ki aakhir ve apane mantri ko bachaane ke liye is had tak kyon gaye? unke mantri ne jo peshey se vakil hai, ek mahila kii aadhi raat giraftaar ke liye edi chotii kaa jor laga diya or vah bhi mahaj andeh ke aadhaar par
 By opening a front against the policemen, Arvind Kejriwal also lost the sympathy he had received by paying him a compensation of Rs one crore to the family of a policeman killed on duty
 unki party ke kaaryakarta saare samay police waalon ke khilaaf naare lagaate dikhe
 Did Kejriwal forget that the Delhi Police is not under the state government and despite being extremely powerful in the party, former CM Sheila Dixit could not get the then commissioner Neeraj Kumar removed after the Nirbhaya incident
 agar vah dilli police ko rajya sarkaar ke andar laana chaahate hai to unhen sansad se anumati leni hogi or yah behad kathin he
 However, it is also surprising that the state police is not in the hands of the state government, just as the land here is not in the hands of the local government
 ab yah andolan kejariwal ko baari padegaa bhale hi unke samarthak unke saath khadey hon lekin jis tarah se yah sara kuch hua, itnaa hangaamaa or shor machaa ki tatasth naagarik party ke bare main sochane par vivash ho gaye
 This party is still in infancy and it is necessary for it to take such steps so that public opinion about it remains the same as it was in the beginning
 ek loktantric vyavastha main araajaktaa ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Kejriwal knows very well how the administration works, so why did he start behaving like a chaotic leader? If he has to play a long innings, then first of all he has to pay attention to the promises he made to the public
 unhen bhuulakar idhar-udhar kii baaten karnaa unke vivek par sawaal khadaa karegaa or party jai se kshay kii ore chali jaaegi

 Uddhav Thackeray's swearing-in ceremony at Shivaji Park Shiv Sena is from Shivaji Park Old Shivaji Park has an old and deep relationship with Shiv Sena
 balsahab thakare apni siyaasi pari kaa aagaaj karne or shivasena kii sthapana se lekar vipakshi partiyon ke khilaaf isi shivaji park se dahaada karte the
 This is the reason why Uddhav Thackeray, the political heir of Balasaheb Thackeray, has chosen Shivaji Park for his coronation
 uddhav thakare kaa shapath grahan samaaroh shivaji park main yojit kiya jayega
 Shivaji Park has great importance in the history of Shiv Sena
 kyonki party ke sansthaapak bal thakare ne 1966 main apni pehali raily isi maidan main kii thi
 Since then, Balsahab Thackeray continued this sequence
 bala sahab thakare isi maidan se har chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karte the
 Every year on the day of Vijayadashami, Balasaheb Thackeray used to hold a big rally in this Shivaji Park and roared against the opposition parties
 maharashtra kii siyasat main shivasena kii pehali baar sarkaar bijepi ke samarthan ke saath 1995 main bani thi
 It was the period of Bal Thackeray
 manohar joshi mukhyamantri bane the or unki tajposhi ke liye isi shivaji park ko hi chunaa gaya tha
 Balasaheb Thackeray died on 17 November 2012, in the same park where he was lit
 bal thakare ke baad unki raajnneetik viraasat sambhaal rahe uddhav thakare ne shivaji park se apana naata jode rakhaa
 That is why Shiv Sena had put all its strength to build Bal Thackeray memorial in Shivaji Park
 sarkaar ne smarak ke liye dhan bhi aavantit kar diya tha, lekin supreme court ne roak laga di thi
 Actually Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is one of the biggest characters in the history of Maharashtra
 16veen shatabdi main maratha samrajya kii neenv rakhane vaale shivaji ko maharashtra main bhagwaan kii tarah puja jaataa he
 After the formation of Maharashtra State in 1960, Chhatrapati Shivaji has always been mentioned in electoral politics here
 yahi vajah he ki bala sahib thakare ne shivasena kii sthapana ke apana adarsh shivaji ko banaaya tha
 The 'hindutva' image of Shivaji like a fighter who fought against the Mughal Sultanate has always liked political parties like Shiv Sena and BJP
 vahiin 'maratha' raja kii chhavi congress-ensipi jaise dalon ko rajya kii maratha samudaay ko apni ore khinchne ke liye madadgaar sabit hui he
 Governments have formed and fallen in Maharashtra on issues related to Chhatrapati Shivaji
 isiilie chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ko shivasena ne apni raajnneeti kii centre hameshaa rakhaa he
 After Bal Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray has kept his relationship with Shivaji firmly linked
 isiilie uddhav thakare ne apane shapath grahan samaaroh ko shivaji park main karne kaa faisla kiya he

 Aam Aadmi Party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award before he entered politics
 2006 main 37 varshiya arvind kejariwal ko antarrashtriya manch par pratishthit yah award diya gaya he
 He was given this award to Kejriwal for two reasons
 ek kaaran tha artiai ke liye jaagrukta laana or prayog karnaa or doosraa anti karpshan muhim
 Kejriwal campaigned a lot against corruption
 ab arvind kejariwal ke ke purv sahyogi rahe sunil laal ne ek baar phir unhen yah puraskaar dene vaali sanstha ko likhe patr kaa reminder bheja he or maang kii he ki ve arvind kejariwal ko die gaye magsese puraskaar ko radd kar den
 When Sunil Lal was talked about in this regard, he said that he wrote a letter to the institute on May 10 last year, but no response has been received yet
 isliye aaj unhone santhaan ko phir reminder bhej jawaab maanga he
 On talking, he says that the institute has written on the site that Kejriwal was awarded this award for two reasons
 isamen ek bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai he to doosraa artiai
 Lal said that ever since the government was formed in Delhi under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, neither corruption has reduced in his own special department nor Delhi government and especially his own office has any special interest regarding RTI
 unhone bataaya ki jin do kaarnon se sanstha ne unhen magsese puraskaar diya tha ab jab vah satta main aae hai donon hi jagahon par ve vifal hai
 He said that Maharashtra Anil Galgale filed an RTI in the Delhi government and asked for the details of expenditure on the advertisement, then the Chief Minister's Office refused to give information
 vahaan dilli shailendra singh ne bhi artiai daayar kar jawaab maanga to unhen bhi jawaab nahin diya gaya
 At the same time, Sunil Lal said that as far as corruption is concerned, here too the government has completely failed
 haal ke aaropon se yah sabit hota he ki dilli sarkaar main bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 Referring to Kapil Mishra, he said that now questions are being raised on Arvind Kejriwal
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki ek iares hone ke naate unhen tex vibhaag ke bhrashtachar par ankush lagaana chahie tha lekin aaj bhi is vibhaag main bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 Arvind Kejriwal's IAC colleague Sunil Lal said, "I have written to the institute that there has been a mistake in checking you
" jab inaki naak ke neeche yah sab ho rahaa he to aapako puraskaar waapas lenaa chahie
 The comments sunil laal se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya santhaan kii ore se koi jawaab aayaa
 He then states that he does not expect an answer
 yah virodh he jo vah kar rahe hai
 Sunil Lal said that if i just go, then i should go to protest in front of the center of the institute in Philippine
 is sambandh main aaj unhone twit bhi kiya he
 He also said that his Twitter account is being hacked
 ve lagaataar password badal rahe hai lekin kuch shararti tatv yah kaam kar rahe hai
 Sunil Lal said that he has also complained to Twitter India in this regard

 Sunil Lal said that he has also complained to Twitter India in this regard
 sunil laal se jab is sambandh main baat kii gai tab unka kahana tha ki unhone santhaan ko chitthee pichley saal 10 may ko likhi thi lekin abhi tak koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 Therefore, today, he has sent a reminder to the institute and sought a reply
 baat karne par unka kahana he ki santhaan ne site par likhaa he ki kejariwal ko do vajahon se is puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 One is the fight against corruption and the other is RTI
 laal ne kaha ki jab se dilli main arvind kejariwal ke netritv main sarkaar bani he tab se na to unke apane khaas vibhaag main bhrashtachar kam hua he na hi dilli sarkaar or khaskar unke apane karyaalay main artiai ko lekar koi khaas ruchi he
 He said that the two reasons for which the organization gave him the Magsaysay Award, now that he has come to power, he has failed in both places
 unhone bataaya ki maharashtra anil galgale ne dilli sarkaar main artiai daayar kar vigyaapan par kharche kaa byoraa maanga to mukhyamantri karyaalay ne jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya
 There, Delhi Shailendra Singh also filed an RTI and asked for an answer, so he was not given a reply
 vahiin sunil laal ne kaha ki jahaan tak bhrashtachar kii baat he to yahaan bhi sarkaar puri tarah fail ho gai he
 Recent allegations prove that corruption is prevalent in the Delhi government
 unhone kapil mishra ke zikr karte hue kaha ki ab arvind kejariwal par hi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Along with this, he said that as an IRS, he should have curbed the corruption of the tax department but even today corruption is prevalent in this department
 arvind kejariwal ke iasi se sahyogi rahe sunil laal ne kaha ki maine santhaan ko likhaa he ki aapako jaanchane main galati ho gai he
 When all this is happening under their nose, you should take back the prize
 tippaniyan Sunil Lal was asked if there was any reply from the institute
 tab unka kaha he ki vah jawaab kii apeksha nahin karte
 This is opposition to what he is doing
 sunil laal ne kaha ki meraa bas chale to main philippine main santhaan ke centre ke saamne virodh karne chale jaaen
 Today he has also tweeted in this regard
 saath hi unhone kaha ki unka twitor acount hack kiya ja rahaa he
 They are constantly changing passwords but some mischievous elements are doing this
 sunil laal ne bataaya ki unhone is sambandh main twitor india se shikaayat bhi kii he
 On talking, he says that the institute has written on the site that Kejriwal was awarded this award for two reasons
 isamen ek bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai he to doosraa artiai

 shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya ki ayodhya main ram mandir kii neenv unki party ne rakhi thi, aise main mandir nirmaan kaa shrey kisi ek dal ko nahin jaataa he
 BJP president Amit Shah said on Monday that according to the wishes of Indians settled around the world, a grand Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya within four months
 shah ke is bayaan par raut ne maharashtra vidhaan bhawan ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘amit shah ne yah sahi kaha he ki aasmaan choota ram mandir banegaa
 But Shiv Sena did the work of laying the foundation of the temple
 ''yah poochne par ki kya iskaa matlab he ki ram mandir ke liye shrey bhaajapa ko jaataa he, raut ne kaha, ‘‘nahin, iskaa shrey lakhon, karodon car sevakon ko jaataa he jisamen vihip, sadhu, sant, bhaajapa kaaryakarta shaamil hai
 Credit does not go to any one party but to everyone
 '' is bich, rajya vidhansabha ke yahaan jari sheetakaaleen satr ke duusare din, bhaajapa vidhayak flex board ke saath aaj vidhansabha tak pahunche jin par shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana' main prakashit ek report darj thi jisamen bemausam barish se prabhavit kisaanon ke liye prati hectare 25,000 rupee kii maang kii gai thi
 In response to a question, Raut said, "now he is keen to read 'saamana' but while in power, the then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis used to say that he does not read Marathi publications
 '' raut ne purv mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii chutki lete hue kaha, ‘‘satta main rahete hue agar ve ‘saamana' padhate to shaayad satta main bane rahete
 '' udhampur main hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad yah jaanane kii jarurat he ki pakistan main aatankwaadi paidaa karne ke liye vahaan kis tarah se 'jannatein' banaai gai hai
 Seeing the picture of terrorist caught in Udhampur, it is easy to guess how young he is
 usase 'samuhik poochtacha' kii jari tasviir main vah jis tarah se betkalluf andaaz main sawaalon ke jawaab detaa dikh rahaa he, usase bhi uski umr kaa allhadpan jaahir hota he
 His natural laughter does not even make him think that he will know the fate of Kasab's life
 aakhir kis tarah kii training di jaati he aatankwaad ke mishan par nikle aise naujavaanon ko ki unhen ehsaas bhi nahin hota ki unke apane mulq ke kuch log kis tarah se unka istemaal karne ja rahe hai
 How they are being pushed to death
 jaise ki is cese main, ek saathi maaraa gaya he or duusare ko ehsaas nahin ki vah doosraa kasaab ho gaya he
 In order to visit areas like Swat and Bajaur in Pakistan, some such information was found that was shocking
 inamen se ek he fidaayin hamalon ke liye taiyaar kiye jane vaale aatankwaadiyon ko 'jananath' main jaakar vahaan kii jindagi dikhaane kaa tarika
 For this, the trainers of the terrorists prepare such 'jannat' in the house of some rooms, in which the adolescent boys are specially lured
 in kamaron kii chhaten nile rang kii hoti hai
 It is the sky that is inserted in the boys' minds
 upree deevaaron par ped-paudhe or titliyaan baniin hoti hai
 It is a green forest for them
 nichali deevaaron par pani kii bahati dhara hoti he
 These are rivers
 tippaniyan The new recruit is brought here and told that this is the paradise
 huuren bhi yaheen basati hai
 Curiosity is created in such a way that it gets fixed on the hurray in heaven
 phir vahaan ek se lekar kai 'hoor' tak chhod di jaati hai
 a young man who sees his sex-related dreams come true reinforces his trust in his trainer
 kuch dinon ke baad use bataaya jaataa he ki jo tumne yahaan 'bhoga' he vah to kuch bhi nahin, asal 'jananath to upar he, vahaan jaaoge to aish karoge'
 It is obvious that boys who believe in such things are also found because there is a severe lack of education in Pakistan, especially in the areas where there is terrorism
 un ilaakon main aadhunik shiksha kii koi kiran kabhi pahunchi hi nahin
 There childhood has been the victim of a special kind of religious education
 vahaan ke alhad kishoron ko sirf apni sharir main panpi jaruraton or dimag kii gadhi fantasiyon main jeena hota he
 Around that, the masterminds of terrorism weave their way
 fidaayin dasta taiyaar karte hai
 For this we also prepare such suicidal jackets in which a 'special part' of their body is saved so that they can rejoice in the 'jannat' above! udhampur main pakade gaye aatankwaadi kii tasviir dekhakar sahaj andaja ho jaataa he ki uski umr kitni kam he
 The manner in which he seems to be answering questions in a derisive manner in the released picture of 'mass interrogation' also shows his agelessness
 uski swabhaavik hansi se yah bhi nahin lagata ki use kasaab kii jindagi ke hashr kaa pataa hoga
 After all, what kind of training is given to such youth on a mission of terrorism that they do not even realize how some people of their own countries are going to use them
 kis tarah se unhen maut ke munh main dhakela ja rahaa hai
 As in this case, one partner is killed and the other does not realize that the other has become Kasab
 pakistan main swat or bajore jaise ilaake kaa daura karne ke kram main kuch aisi jaankariyaan milin jo chaunkaane vaali raheen
 One of these is the way to show the life of the terrorists who are prepared for the suicide attacks by going to 'jannat'
 iske liye aatankwaadiyon ke trainer kuch kamaron ke makaan main aisi 'jananath' taiyaar karte hai jinamein khaas taur par kishoravastha ke ladakon ko bahala phusalaakar laayaa jaataa he
 The ceilings of these rooms are blue
 ladakon ke dimag main daalaa jaataa he yah aasmaan he
 Trees and butterflies are made on the upper walls
 yah unke liye haraa bharaa jangal hota he
 There is a flowing stream of water on the lower walls
 yah nadiyaan hoti hai
 The comments nae recruit ko yahaan laakar bataaya jaataa he ki jananath yahi he
 Huron also lives here
 jigyaasa aisi paidaa kii jaati he ki baat jananath main hone vaali hoor par aakar tik jaati he
 Then there are left from one to many 'hur'
 ek noujvaan jo apane sex se jude sapanom ko sach hota dekhtaa he to uskaa uske trainer par bharosa pukhta hota he
 After a few days, he is told that what you have 'bhoga' here is nothing but the real 'paradise is above, if you go there, you will rejoice'
 jaahir he aisi baton main bharosa paalane vaale ladke isliye bhi mil jate hai kyonki pakistan main shiksha kii ghor kami he, khaas taur par aatankwaad grast ilaakon main
 No ray of modern education has ever reached those areas
 vahaan kaa bachapan ek khaas tarah kii mazahabi shiksha kaa shikaar rahaa he
 The thoughtless teenagers there only have to live in their body-building needs and their mind-boggling fantasies
 usee ke aasapaas aatankwaad ke mastermind apana tanabana bunate hai
 Prepare a feed squad
 iske liye aisa aatmghaatee jacket bhi taiyaar kar pahanaate hai jisamen unke sharir kaa 'khaas hissaa' bachaa rahe taaki upar kii 'jananath' main ve aish kar saken!

 May i ask Why? What is so objectionable in this Tweet? - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) October 7, 2019 Earlier, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh said that why do not they celebrate the birth anniversary of Hedgewar, Govalkar, Savarkar with pomp? Why are they hiding their ideology, what role did the RSS play in the freedom movement after its birth? Why are they not celebrating Hedgewar / Gowalkar / Sawarkar Jayanti with such fanfare?

 pulavama hamale ke baad aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar dohare ravaiye ke kaaran pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan apane desh main bhi ghirte hue najar aa rahe hai
 Because of not taking concrete action against terrorist organizations, India is constantly trying to surround Pakistan in international forums
 ab pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan par vahaan ke vipaksh ne nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) President Bilawal Bhutto Zardari targeted Imran Khan while speaking at the National Assembly
 unhone kaha ki yah kaise mumkin ho jaataa he ki nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko faansee par chadha diya jaataa he, lekin aaropee sanghathanon par pabandi nahin lagaai ja sakati he
 Such action is only against the opposition, but there is no investigation against banned organizations
 mere naashte ke liye sanyukt jaanch team gathit kar di jaati he, lekin pratibandhit sanghathanon ke liye jaanch team nahin banaai jaati he
 Bilawal Bhutto said this in the Parliament of Pakistan
 How is it possible that we hang elected prime ministers but we can't banned orgs on trial? There is ehtesab only for the opposition but none for the banned orgs - There can be a JIT on my breakfast but there can't be a JIT on banned orgs: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Parliamentpic

 koi ek hamaari seemaa ghus aata he, hamaari bahadur pakistani vayusena uskaa vimaan maar giraati he lekin hamane use kuch dinon main hi chhod diya
 On the international forums, Pakistan has the feeling that Pakistan is pretending to take terrorists into custody

 pakistan main isse pehle bhi kai baar jamaat ud daawa par bain kii karrwai hoti rahi he, lekin kai baar wo sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf court ja chukaa he
 Hafiz Saeed was declared a terrorist by the United Nations and announced a reward of 10 million dollars on him
 2012 main lashkar par bain lagaaya gaya tha
 Hafiz then formed the Jamaat-ud Dawa and fallah-e-insaniyat Foundation to carry out his terrorist activities and under his guise, carried out his nefarious plans

 # Repost @kushalz with @make_repost ・・・ Fitness drills of @sushantsinghrajput 😉A post shared bysushant Singh Rajput(@sushantsinghrajput) ondec 24, 2018 at 2:29am PST The BJP said on Friday that the 'revelation' of former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) Vinod Rai has confirmed his allegations that the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and 10 Janpath were informed about corruption like 2G spectrum and coal block allocation
 was
 lekin purv pradhanmantri or congress netritv ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat se sattarudh dal ne yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said, "the revelation of the former CAG has confirmed our opinion that big scams like CWG, 2G Spectrum, brother-in-law (robert Vadra land dispute), coal block allocation and Air India were given to the then Prime Minister
 There was information
 ' He also wrapped the Congress leadership in these corruption, saying, 'there was a division of power in the UPA regime
 bhrashtachar kii javabdehi se congress netritv bhi batch nahin saktaa, kyonki sab jaanate hai ki pradhanmantri pad par manmohan singh the, lekin satta 10 janpath (sonia gandhi kaa nivas) ke paas thi
 The Prime Minister used to get a letter from there
 ' Asked whether the bjp-led Narendra Modi government would take action against Manmohan Singh and the Congress leadership or other convicts, the Information and Broadcasting Minister said, "these matters are in the courts
" bhaajapa nit sarkaar jaanch main hastkshep nahin karegi jaisaa ki samprag sarkaar kiya karti thi or kanoon ko apana kaam karne degi
 
 
 It has been 100 days for our government and we have not done any such interference
 The law is doing its job
 ' Javadekar, in response to reporters' questions about former CAG Vinod Rai's recent remarks about Singh, said that corruption was happening one after the other in the UPA government and it is not possible that the then Prime Minister had no information
 unke anusaar 'yah tatkaaleen pradhanmantri kii jimmedaari thi
 There have been so many cases of corruption one after the other and you say that i do not know anything, it cannot happen
 aise main yah gambhir rahasyodghatan he
 ' vinod raay ko bahut safal kaig bataate hue mantri ne kaha ki unhone kai sari aniyamittaaon ko ujagar kiya
 He said, he (javadekar) had complained about corruption in coal allocation, after which CBI investigated
 purv kaig ne ek saakshaatkaar main singh kii aalochana kii he
 He has said that he believes that Singh was part of decisions on allocation of 2G spectrum on first come first serve basis and coal block allocation without auction
 raay ne kaha he, '
 
 2ji or koyala (block aavanton) maamalon main vah (singh) apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakate
 Regarding 2G, A
 Raja (then Telecom Minister) wrote all the letters to him (singh) and he replied to them all
 lekin maine unhen jo bhi patr likhe mujhe unka jawaab nahin mila
 The former CAG said, 'on one occasion when i spoke to him, the Prime Minister said, i hope you are not expecting an answer from my side, whereas he used to reply to the king twice a day
 aise main un nirnyon ke liye unhen jimmedaar kaise nahin tehraaya ja saktaa?' In Amreli district of Gujarat, 11 people, including three children and several women, were killed when a truck hit an autorickshaw

 palasi tu partishan: a history of modern indiakitab ko 10 saal pehle prakashit karne vaale hyderabad ke publicing house orient blaxwan or kitaab ke lekhak shekhar bandyopadhyaay ko 14 april ko dilli ke ek ritred skool teacher kii ore se kanoonee notice mila
 In this three-page letter, Bandyopadhyay has been accused of using 'derogatory and contemptuous' words for the RSS in his book, while the book has been described by historian Ramachandra Guha as 'the best' and any other historian of the history of the time Has told the most factual details than the book of bandyopadhyaay kehete hai, ''duniyabar main itihaas ke hajaaron chaatr or shikshakon ne ise padhaa he or mujhe ab tak sirf sakaaratmak pratikriya hi mili he
 But i am suffering from the recently filed complaint
 ” 85 varshiya deenanath bataraa kii ore se bheje gaye notice ko dekhte hue publicing house ne faisla kiya ki aisi sabhi kitabon ko prakashit karne se pehle unki samiksha kar lee jaae, jinase aisi pratikriya paidaa hone kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 On 16 May, Orient Blackswan halted the publication and distribution of debutant writer Megha Kumar's book Communalism and Sexual Violence: Ahmedabad Sins 1969
 kitaab ko online bikri ke liye daalaa gaya tha
 Megha, a senior South Asia analyst from her office in London-based think tank Oxford Analytica, told the phone that the publisher had not spoken directly to her about which part of the book was objectionable
 unhone kaha ki yah acadmic kitaab he, jisaki shuruyaat main bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah 1969 se ab tak muslim mahilaayein yon hinsa kaa saamana karti ai hai
 The former teacher of India-born Oxford University's South Asian History and Politics noted for the first time in late April that his book did not exist on the publisher's website
 tab tak kitaab kii 10 pratiyaan bik chuki thim
 He wrote a letter to the publisher, but the answer came from Uday Rao, president of Humanities and Social Science at Orient Blackswan, on May 19
 chitthee main likhaa tha, ''kanoonee karrwai se bilkul alag hamen hamaare lekhakon, staff or unke pariwaron ke saath hinsak ghatnaon ke hone kii ashanka sata rahi he, jisase unke jivan or suraksha par khatra ho saktaa he
 Megha has sought clarification on a number of things in the letter and is also seeking legal advice on her own options for action
 ve kahati hai, ''main to isse baahar nikal sakati hum kyonki main landan main rahati hum
 But this is worrying for India's academics and media
 ”bataraa march, 2014 ko us samay surkhiyon main aa gaye, jab unhone penguin jaise kaddavar publicing house par mukadmaa thokkar use na sirf wendi donigar kii kitaab da hindooj: ain alternetive theory ke prakaashan, vitaran or bikri par roak lagane ke liye majaboor kiya, balki stock main padi sabhi pratiyaan bhi nasht karne par baadhya kiya
 This is not the only story of Batra's success
 ab tak unhone 10 kanoonee ladaaiyaan ladiin, jinamein se nau main kitabon se 'galat tathyon’ ko hataane kii maang kii gai thi— unhen sabhi main jeet hasil hui
 According to Batra, former General Secretary of RSS school Vidya Bharati, sitting in his simple house on the campus of Saraswati Bal Mandir in Naraina Vihar, Delhi, he has nothing to do with Orient Blackswan's decision to remove Megha's book
 aresas kii shaikshanik shakha vidya bharti ke purv mahasachiv bataraa kehete hai, ''yah vishuddh rup se unka apana faisla he

 Bengal and its rites, customs and society of that time are all peeped
 unki kahaniyon ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ye sarvshereshth hote hue bhi lokapriy hai or lokapriy hote hue bhi sarvshereshth hai
 The stories of Rabindranath make Amar Sonar Bangla a magical Bengal - especially rural Bengal - come true in front of us
 unki kahaniyon ke nayak nayika adarshavaadi hai, or unka prem, adarsh, mulya, siddhant balidaan va utsarg kaa paath padhaate hai
 Rabindranath is unique in his stories
 bangala bhashaa or bengal ke kahani ke kshetra main unase pehle koi nahin hua or baad bhi unke jaisi anubhuti viral he
 In his stories, he draws rare scenes of the vast humanity by his imaginative depiction of life
 unki shreshth kahaniyon kii ginati mushkil he, phir bhi 'anadhikaar pravesh’, ‘master sahab’, ‘postmaster’, ‘jivit or mrit’, ‘kabuliwala’, 'aadhi raat main’, ‘kshudhit pashaan’, ‘atithi’, ‘durasha’, ‘tota-kahani’ tathaa 'aparichita' ko pathakvarg ke bich ek khaas mukaam hasil he
 Today, on his birth anniversary, one of his countless stories has been chosen as the best story: Kahani: Aparichita - Rabindranath Tagore Today i am only twenty-seven years old

 The mother was the daughter of a poor household; Therefore, neither did she forget that we were rich, nor would she let me forget

 But my maternal uncle, who was the principal agent of my destiny deity on earth, had a special opinion regarding marriage
 amir kii kanya unhen pasand na thi
 The girls who came to our house with their heads bowed, this is what they wanted
 phir bhi rupee ke prati unki nas-nas main aasakti samaai hui thi
 They wanted an alliance that does not have money, but which does not make an error in giving money
 jiskaa shoshan to kar liya jaae, par jise ghar aane par gudgudi ke badale bandhe hukke main (gudgudi hukka adhik sammaan-suchak samajha jaataa he, bandhaa hukka maamuli hukka hota he) tambaakoo dene par jisaki shikaayat na sunani pade
 My friend Harish used to work in Kanpur
 chhuttiyon main usne kalakatta aakar meraa man chanchal kar diya
 Said, listen, if it is a girl, then she is a good girl
 kuch din pehle hi em
 a
 paas kiya tha
 As far as the sight went in front, he was discharging; There is no examination, no candidacy, no job; There is no worry about seeing your property, not even education, not even desire - in being there was a mother inside and maternal uncle outside
 is avkaash kii marubhumi main meraa hriday us samay vishwavyaapee nari-rup kii marichika dekh rahaa tha- akaash main uski drushti thi, vaayu main uskaa nirishwaas, taru-marmar main uski rahasyamayi baaten
 In such a situation, Harish came and said, if it is the matter of the girl
 meraa tan man vasant vaayu se dolayit bakul van kii navpallav-raashi kii bhaanti dhoop-chhaanh kaa pat bunane laga
 Harish was a rasik, he had the power to describe Ras Undelkar, and my mind was triticatt
 maine harish se kaha, ek baar mamaa se baat chalaakar dekho!baithak jamaane main harish adwitiya tha
 It was everywhere for his sake
 mamaa bhi use paakar chhodana nahin chaahate the
 The talk went on in their meeting
 ladki kii apeksha ladki ke pita kii jaankaree hi unke liye mahatvapurn thi
 Father's condition was the way he wanted
 kisi jamaane main unke vansh main lakshmi kaa mangal ghat bharaa rahata tha
 At this time, consider it as zero, yet there was a little left in the bottom
 apane praant main vansh-maryaada kii raksha karke chalanaa sahaj na samajhakar ve pashchim main jaakar vaas kar rahe the
 The poor lived there like a householder
 ek ladki ko chhodkar unke or koi nahin tha
 Therefore, there will be no hesitation in reversing Lakshmi's components behind her
 yah sab to sundar tha
 But, upon hearing that the girl is fifteen, the maternal uncle felt heavy
 vansh main to koi dosha nahin he? nahin, koi dosha nahin- pita apni kanya ke yogya var kahin bhi na khoj paae
 One was expensive in the bride's court, on the other hand the condition of bow-break, so the father is patiently sitting, but the age of the girl is not patient
 jo ho, harish kii saras rachana main gun tha, mamaa kaa man naram pad gaya
 The wedding part was completed smoothly
 kalakatta ke baahar baaki jitani duniya he, sabko mamaa andaman dweep ke antargat hi samajhate the
 Once in life, he went to Konnagar for a special work
 mamaa yadi manu hote to ve apni samhita main haavda ke pul ko paar karne kaa ekadam nishedh kar dete
 There was a desire in my mind, go and see the girl myself
 par prastaav karne kaa saahas na kar sakaa
 To bless the girl (bengalis have a ritual to ensure the marriage - in which people from the groom's side give some ornaments to the girl and the girl's side bless the groom) those who were sent were our Vinu Dada, My cousin brother unke mat, ruchi evam dakshata par main solah aane nirbhar kar saktaa tha
 After returning, Vinu Dada said, it is not bad, sir! Real gold
 vinu dada kii bhashaa atyant sanyat thi
 Where we used to say 'apoorva', there they used to say 'improvisation'
 atev main samajha, mere bhagya main panchashar kaa prajapati se koi virodh nahin he

 kanya ke pita shambhunath babu harish par kitna vishwaas karte the, iskaa pramaan yah tha ki vivaah ke teen din pehle unhone mujhe pehali baar dekha or aashirwad kii rasm puri kar gaye
 His condition will be around forty
 bal kaale the, muunchon kaa paknaa abhi prarambh hi hua tha
 He was beautiful, his face was the first to be seen in the crowd
 aashaa karata hum ki mujhe dekhakar ve khush hue
 It was difficult to understand because they were taciturn
 jo ekaadh baat kehete bhi the use maano puraa jor dekar nahin kehete the
 Meanwhile, Mama's mouth was moving at an unhindered pace - in money, our place in Maan was no less than anyone in the city, they were promoting this in a different way
 shambhunath babu ne is baat main bilkul yoga nahin diya- kisi bhi prasang main koi 'haa' yaa 'hum' tak nahin sunai padi
 i would have been discouraged, but it was difficult to discourage my maternal uncle
 unhone shambhunath babu kaa shant swabhaav dekhakar sochaa ki aadmi bilkul nirjeev he, tanik bhi tej nahin
 It is a sin to have a strong sense of belonging, even if at all times, therefore, heart-to-heart uncle was happy
 shambhunath babu jab uthe to mamaa ne sankshep main upar se hi unako vidaa kar diya, gaadi main bithaane nahin gaye
 Regarding dowry, both sides were confirmed
 mamaa apane ko asaadhaaran chatur samajhakar garv karte the
 They would not leave any holes in the conversation
 rupee kii sankhya to nishchit thi hi, upar se gahanaa kitne bhar evam sona kis dar kaa hoga, yah bhi ekadam tay ho gaya tha
 i myself was not into these things; Did not know if the transaction has been fixed
 main jaanata tha ki yah sthool bhaag hi vivaah kaa ek pradhan ang he; evam us ansh kaa bhaar jinke upar he ve ek kaudi bhi nahin thagaayenge
 In fact, as a very clever person, maternal uncle was the proud object of our whole family
 jahaan kahin bhi hamaara koi sambandh ho parvat hi buddhi kii ladaai main jeetenge, yah bilkul pakki baat thi
 Therefore, despite our never staying here, and despite the lack of toughness on the other side, we will win, the insistence of our family was - whether anyone survives or dies
 haldi chadhaane kii rasm badi dhoomdhaam se hui
 The tippers were so much that they had to keep a clerk to keep track of their numbers
 unako vidaa karne main avar paksh kaa jo naakon-dam hoga uskaa samaran karke mamaa ke saath swar milakar maa khub hansi
 The bands, the shehnai, the fancy concerts, etc
, where all the loud voices were there, i got into the marriage house by doling out the music of Saraswati by a beautiful elephant like barbaric clamor
 anguthi, haar, jari, jawaharaat se meraa sharir aisa lag rahaa tha jaise gahane kii dukaan nilaam par chadhi ho
 How much was the value of his future mobilization, it was like writing clearly in some quantity and went on to compete with future father-in-law
 mamaa vivaah ke ghar pahunchakar prasann nahin hue
 For one, there was not a place to sit in the courtyard, but the whole event was simple
 upar se shambhunath babu kaa vyavhaar bhi nihaayat thanda tha
 His plea was not Ajsar
 munh main shabd hi na the
 If one of his lawyer friends with seated throat, ganji skull, krishnavarna and macro body is tied in the waist, pairs of hands, shaking heads, humble smiles and giddy words, everyone from Concert Party Kartalar to Varkar repeatedly If i had not anointed abundant enough, the matter would have gone beyond this or that in the beginning
 mere sabha main baithne ke kuch der baad hi mamaa shambhunath babu ko bagal ke kamare main bula le gaye
 Don't know what happened
 kuch der baad hi shambhunath babu ne aakar mujhase kaha, lalaji, jaraa idhar to aaie!'maamla yah tha- sabhi kaa na ho, kintu kisi-kisi manushya kaa jivan main koi ek lakshya rahata he
 Mama's only goal was to not be cheated by anyone
 unhen dar tha ki unke samadhi unhen gahanon main dhokhaa de sakate hai- vivaah-kaary samaapt ho jane par us dhokhe kaa koi pratikaar na ho sakegaa
 The kind of dragging that was introduced in the matter of house rent, gift, farewell of people, etc
, the uncle decided that - depending on this man's mere word about giving and giving will not work
 isi kaaran ghar ke sunar tak ko saath laae the
 Going into the next room and saw, Mama was sitting on a chair
 ek sunar apni taraazoo, baat or kasuti aadi liye jameen par
 Shambhunath Babu said to me, 'your maternal uncle says that he will check all the jewels of the girl before the marriage starts, what is your opinion about it?' i kept quiet with my head down
 mamaa bole, 'vah kya kahegaa
 It will be what i say
 'shambhunath babu ne meri ore dekhakar kaha, 'to phir yahi tay rahaa? ye jo kahenge vahi hoga? is sambandh main tumhen kuch nahin kahana he?'maine jaraa gardan hilaakar ishaare se bataaya, 'in sab baton main meraa bilkul bhi adhikaar nahin he
 "well, sit down and bring all the jewels from the girl's body
" ' yah kehete hue ve uthe
 Mama said, 'what will Anupam do here? He went to the meeting and sat
 'shambhunath bole, 'nahin, sabha main nahin, yaheen baithna hoga
 After some time, he brought ornaments tied in a cloth and spread it on the outpost
 saare gahane unki pitamahi ke jamaane ke the, nae fishan kaa baarik kaam na tha- jaisaa motaa tha vaisaa hi baari tha
 The goldsmith lifted the jewel in his hand and said, 'what should i see? isamen koi milawat nahin he- aise sone kaa aajkal vyavhaar hi nahin hota
 Saying this, he showed a thick baller with the mouth of Makara pressing something, he used to get crooked
 mamaa ne usee samay note-book main gahanon kii suchi bana lee- kahin jo dikhaaya gaya tha usamen se kuch kam na ho jaae
 After calculating, the quantity, rate and weight of the jewel was more than the quantity given
 gahanon main ek joda earing tha
 Shambhunath gave it to the goldsmith and said, "just test it!" The goldsmith said, "this is a luxury item, only the gold part is small in it
" 'shanbhu babu ne earing jodi mamaa ke haath main dete hue kaha, 'ise aap hi rakhen!'mamaa ne use haath main lekar dekha, yahi earing kanya ko dekar unhone aashirwad kii rasm puri kii thi
 The maternal uncle's face turned red, the poor would want to cheat him, but he would not be cheated, he was deprived of this pleasure, and in addition some upper attainment was also achieved
 munh atyant baari karke bole, 'anupam, jaao tum sabha main jaakar baitho!'shambhunath babu bole, 'nahin, ab sabha main baithna nahin hoga
 Let's feed you guys first
 'mamaa bole, 'yah kya kah rahe hai? lagn
 
 
 'shambhuna Tha Babu said,' Don't worry for him- get up now! 'the man was very good, but inside he seemed more obstinate
 mamaa ko uthanaa padaa
 The Baratis also had their food
 aayojan main aadambar nahin tha
 But the kitchen was good and everything was clean
 isse sabhi trupt ho gaye
 When the Baratis finished their meal, Shambhunath Babu asked me to eat
 mamaa ne kaha, 'yah kya kah rahe hai? vivaah ke pehle var kaise bhojan karegaa!'is sambandh main ve mamaa ke vyakt kiye mat kii purna upeksha karke meri ore dekhakar bole, 'tum kya kehete ho? bhojan ke liye baithne main koi dosha he?'murtimati matra-ajna-swaroop mamaa upasthit the, unke viruddh chalanaa mere liye asambhav tha
 i could not sit for food
 tab shambhunath babu ne mamaa se kaha, 'aap logon ko bahut ksht diya he
 We are not rich
 aap logon ke yogya vyavastha nahin kar sake, kshamaa karenge
 It is night, you do not want to increase your suffering
 to phir is samay-mamaa bole, 'to, sabha main chaliye, ham to taiyaar hai
 'shambhunath said,' Then call your car? 'mama said in surprise,' Are you joking? 'shambhunath said,' You have only joked
 majaak ke sampark ko sthaayee karne kii meri ichha nahin he
 'uncle left both eyes oblivious
 shambhunath ne kaha, 'apni kanya kaa gahanaa main chura luungaa, jo yah baat sochataa he uske haathon main kanya nahin de saktaa
 'he did not think it necessary to say a word to me
 kaaran, pramanit ho gaya tha, main kuch bhi nahin tha
 There is no desire to say what happened after that
 jhaad-phanus tod-phodkar, cheez-vastu ko nasht-bhrasht karke baratiyon kaa dal daksh-yajna kaa naatak puraa karke baahar chalaa aayaa
 On returning home, the band, the shehnai and the concert were not all together and asbestos bushes did not know where to attain their salvation by performing their duties above the stars of the sky
 3ghar ke sab log krodh se aag-babula ho gaye
 Kali's father has come so full of pride
 sab bole, dekhen, ladki kaa vivaah kaise karte hai
 But, the girl will not get married, what is the solution to punish the fear that is not there in my mind? i was the only man in Bengal who was returned from public life by the girl's father himself
 itane bade satpaatr ke maathe par kalank kaa itnaa bada daag kis dusht grah ne itnaa prachaar karke gaaje-baaje se samaaroh karke aank diya? baraati yah kehete hue maathaa peetane lage ki vivaah nahin hua, lekin hamako dhokhaa dekar khilaa diya- sampurna ann sahit pakvashay nikaalkar vahaan phenk aate to afsos mitata
 While saying 'I will claim the breach of marriage and loss of honor,' the maternal uncle made a lot of noise, the benefactors explained that the spectacle left by doing this will also be completed, it is meaningless to say, i was also very angry, 'somehow Shambhunath fell on my feet after losing badly,' he only wished while giving a mustache to the line of mustache
 kintu, is aakrosh kii kaali dhara ke sameep ek or strot bah rahaa tha, jiskaa rang bilkul bhi kaala nahin tha
 The whole mind ran towards that unfamiliar
 abhi tak use kisi bhi prakaar waapas nahin mode sakaa
 Left under the cover of the wall
 uske maathe par chandan charchit tha, deh par laal sari, chehre par lajja kii lalaai, hriday main kya tha yah kaise kah saktaa hum! mere kalpalok kii kalpalata vasant ke samast phulon kaa bhaar mujhe nivedit kar dene ke liye jhuk padi thi
 The wind was coming, the aroma was getting, the words of the leaves were listening - it was only late to extend one step - in the meantime, the distance of the foot became infinitely within a moment
 itane din tak roj shaam ko maine vinu dada ke ghar jaakar unako pareshaan kar daalaa tha
 Because of Vinu Dada's very dense brevity of the narration-style, each of his words set fire to my mind like a spooling
 maine samajha tha ki ladki kaa rup bada apurv tha; kintu na to use ankhon dekha or na uskaa chitra, sab-kuch aspasht rah gaya
 Not only did he catch him outside, he could not bring it in his mind - that is why, like a ghost, the mind started wandering outside the wall of that marriage meeting that day
 harish se suna, ladki ko meraa photograph dikhaaya gaya tha
 Must have liked
 na karne kaa to koi kaaran hi na tha
 My mind says that he has hidden that picture in a box
 kamare kaa darwaja band karke akeli kisi-kisi nirjan dopahari main kya vah use kholkar na dekhati hogi? jab jhukkar dekhati hogi tab chitra ke upar kya uske mukh ke donon ore se khule bal aakar nahin padate honge? akasmaat baahar kisi ke pair kii aahat pate hi kya vah jhat-pat apane sugandhit anchal main chitra ko chipa na leti hogi?din biit jate hai
 One year passed
 mamaa to lajja ke maare vivaah sambandh kii baat hi na ched pate
 Mother's wish was, when people of society forget about my insult, then they will try to marry
 duusari ore maine suna ki shaayad us ladki ko acha var mil gaya he, kintu usne pran kiya he ki vivaah nahin karegi
 Hearing this, the mind was filled with joy
 main kalpana main dekhne laga, vah acchhee tarah khaati nahin; sandhya ho jaati he, vah bal baandhna bhul jaati he
 Her father looks at her mouth and thinks, 'why is my girl becoming like this day by day?' Suddenly, someday he comes to her room and sees the girl's eyes filled with tears
 poochhate hai, beti, tuje kya ho gaya he, mujhe bataa? ladki jhatpat aansu ponchkar kahati he, 'kahaan, kuch bhi to nahin hua, pitaaji!' baap kii iklauti ladki he na- badi laadli ladki he
 Like a flower bud in the days of drought, when the girl died completely, then the soul of the father could not bear any more
 maan tyagkar ve daudkar hamaare daravaaje par aae
 after that? After that, the black current flowing in the mind, as if taking a form like a black snake, hiss arose
 usne kaha, acha he, phir ek baar vivaah kaa saaj sajaayaa jaae, roshni jaale, desh-videsh ke logon ko nimantran diya jaae, uske baad tum var ke maur ko pairon se kuchalakar dal-bal lekar sabha se uthakar chale aao! kintu jo dhara ashru-jal ke samaan shubhr thi, vah rajhans kaa rup dhaaran karke boli, jis prakaar main ek din damayanti ke pushpawan main gai thi mujhe usee prakaar ek baar ud jane do-main virahinee ke kaanon main ek baar sukh-andeh de aauun
 after this? After that, the night of grief passed, the rain of new rain, the molten flower raised its face - this time outside the wall, all the people of the world were left, only one person entered
 phir meri kahani khatm ho gai
 4 But the story did not end like this
 jahaan pahunchakar vah anant ho gai he vahaan kaa thodaa-sa vivaran bataakar apana yah lekh samaapt karuunga
 Was going to do pilgrimage with mother
 bhaar mere hi upar tha, kyonki mamaa is baar bhi haavda pul ke paar nahin hue
 Was sleeping in the train jhonke khate-khate dimag main naanaa prakaar ke bikhare swapnon kaa jhunjhuna baj rahaa tha
 Suddenly waking up at one station, it was a dream mixed with light and darkness
 keval akaash ke taragan chirparichit the- or sab aparichit aspasht tha; stesan kii kai sidhi khadi battiyaan prakaash dwaara yah dharti kitni aparichit he evam jo chaaron ore he vah kitna adhik dur he, yahi dikhaa rahi thim
 Mother was sleeping in the car; The green curtain was hanging under the light, the trunk, the boxes, the stuff all scattered on top of each other
 vah maano swapnlok kaa ulataa-pulata saamaan ho, jo sandhya kii hari batti ke timatimaate prakaash main hone or na hone ke bich na jane kis dhang se padaa tha
 Meanwhile, someone spoke in the wonderful night of that strange world, come early, there is room in this box
 laga, jaise geet suna ho
 How sweet the Bengali dialect looks from the mouth of a Bengali girl, it can be fully estimated by suddenly hearing at such an inappropriate place
 kintu, is swar ko niri ek ladki kaa swar kahkar shrenee-bhukt kar dene se kaam nahin chalegaa
 It was the voice of another person, the mind starts saying, 'never heard of this before
 'gale kaa swar mere liye sadaa hi bada satya rahaa he
 The form is also no less a big thing, but the innermost and indescribable in human beings, i think, is the shape of a voice
 chatpat janglaa kholkar maine munh baahar nikaala, kuch bhi na dikhaa
 The guard standing in the dark on the platform shook his one-eyed lantern, the carriage moved; i sat near the forest
 meri ankhon ke saamne koi murti na thi, kintu hriday main main ek hriday kaa rup dekhne laga
 She is like this starry night, which envelops, but cannot be captured
 jo swar! aparichit kanth ke swar! kshan-bhar main hi tum mere chirparichit ke asana par aakar baith gaye ho
 How wonderful you are - the agile of the fickle era bloomed like a flower above the heart, but the movement of its waves did not move any petals, there was no slightest taint in irrational tenderness
 gaadi lohe ke mrudang par taal detii hui chali
 i was listening to the song man-hee-mana
 uski ek hi tech thi- 'dibbe main jagah he
 'what is there, what is the place, how does it get, no one recognizes anyone
 saath hi yah na pahchaanana- maatr koharaa he, maaya he, uske chhin hote hi phir parichay kaa ant nahin hota
 o beautiful voice! Is the heart of which you are a wonderful form not familiar to me? The place is, is called early, i come soon, it is not too late for a moment
 raat main thik se neend nahin ai
 Often, looking out at every station once, it started fearing that the one who could not see it would not get off at night
 duusare din subah ek bade stesan par gaadi badalani thi hamaare tikit first class ke the- aashaa thi, bheed nahin hogi
 After getting down, a group of orderly officers are waiting for the car with the goods
 fouj ke koi ek bade general sahab bhraman ke liye nikle the
 The car arrived only after two or three minutes
 samajha, first class kii aashaa chhodani padegi
 i was worried about the mother in which box i should climb
 puri gaadi main bheed thi
 He started walking through the doors
 isi bich second class ke dibbe se ek ladki ne meri maa ko lakshya karke kaha, aap hamaare dibbe main aaie na, yahaan jagah he
 i was shocked
 vahi adbhut madhur swar or vahi geet kii tech 'jagah he' kshan-bhar kii bhi der na karke maa ko lekar dibbe main chadh gaya
 Often there was no time to deliver the goods
 mere-jaisaa asamarth duniya main koi na hoga
 That girl quickly pulled our beds in the moving vehicle from the hands of the porters
 photo khinchne kaa meraa ek camera stesan par hi chhot gaya- dhyaan hi na rahaa
 After that, i do not know what to write
 mere man main ek akhand anand kii tasviir he- use kahaan se shuru karun, kahaan samaapt karun? baithe-baithe ek vaakya ke baad duusare vaakya kii yojana karne kii ichha nahin hoti
 This time saw the same tone with eyes
 is samay bhi vah swar hi jaan padaa
 Stare towards mother's mouth; He saw that his eyes were not falling
 ladki kii avasthaa solah yaa satraa kii hogi, kintu navayauvan ne uske deh, man par kahin bhi jaise jaraa bhi bhaar na daalaa ho
 Her pace was simple, brilliance clean, beauty pure, uncommon, there was no inertia in it
 main dekh rahaa hum, vistaar se kuch bhi kahana mere liye asambhav he
 Not only this, what color sari she was wearing, it cannot be said correctly
 yah bilkul satya he ki uski vesh-bhusha main aisa kuch na tha jo use chhodkar vishesh rup se ankhon ko aakarshith kare
 She was more than the things around her - situated on a simple vault like the auspicious manjari of Rajnigandha, the tree on which she had blossomed completely
 saath main do-teen choti-choti ladkiyaan thim, unke saath uski hansi or baatcheet kaa ant na tha
 i had taken a book in my hand and put my ear to it
 jo kuch kaan main pad rahaa tha vah sab to bacchon ke saath bachapane kii baaten thim
 Her specialty was that there was no difference of state at all - with the little ones she was spontaneously and blissfully small
 saath main bacchon kii kahaniyon kii sachitr pustaken thim- usee kii koi kahani sunaane ke liye ladakiyon ne use gher liya tha, yah kahani avashya hi unhone bees-pachchis baar suni hogi
 i understood why the girls had so much request
 us sudhaa-kanth kii sone kii chadi se sari kahani sona ho jaati thi
 The girl's entire body-mind was completely filled with life, all her movements and shields were touching her life
 at: ladkiyaan jab uske munh se kahani sunatin tab kahani nahin, usee ko sunatin; unke hriday par praanon kaa jharnaa jhar padataa
 His elusive life enlivened all my sun-rays on that day; i felt that the nature which has washed me from its sky is a world-wide expansion of the aristocratic, acid life of that youth
 duusare stesan par pahunchate hi usne khomache vaale ko bulaakar kaaphi-si daal-moth kharidi, or ladakiyon ke saath milakar bilkul bacchon ke samaan kalhasya karte hue nixsancoach bhav se khaane lagi
 My nature was surrounded by a trap - why i could not ask for a fistful of lentils with that cheerful girl? Why didn't you accept your greed with outstretched hand? maa acha or bura lagane ke bich duchiti ho rahi thim
 Even if i am a man in the box, she is not hesitant, especially she is eating like this greed
 yah baat unako pasand nahin aa rahi thi; or use behayaa kehane kaa bhi unhen bhram na hua
 They thought, this girl is in a state, but did not get education
 maa ekaek kisi se baatcheet nahin kar paatin
 His practice was to live far away with people
 is ladki kaa parichay praapt karne kii unako badi ichha thi, kintu swaabhaavik baadha nahin mitaa paa rahi thim
 At this time the train stopped at a big station
 un general sahab ke saathiyon kaa ek dal is stesan se chadhane kaa praytn kar rahaa tha
 There was no place in the car
 kai baar ve hamaare dibbe ke saamne se nikle
 Mother was rooted in fear, i too was not experiencing peace in mind
 gaadi chhootane ke thodi der pehle ek deshi rail-karmchaaree ne dibbon kii do bainchon ke siron par naam likhe hue do tikit latakaakar mujhase kaha is, dibbe kii ye do bainchen pehle se hi do saahabon ne rigerv kara rakhi hai, aap logon ko duusare dibbe main janaa hoga
 i immediately panicked and stood up
 ladki hindi main boli, nahin, ham dibba nahin chodenge
 The man insisted, saying, there is no choice left
 kintu, ladki ke utarane kii ichha kaa koi lakshan na dekhakar vah utarkar angrej stesan-master ko bula laayaa
 He came and said to me, i am sorry, but listening to this, i cried 'porter-porter'
 ladki ne uthakar donon ankhon se aag barasaate hue kaha, nahin, aap nahin ja sakate, jaise hai baithe rahiye!yah kahkar usne daravaaje ke paas khadey hokar stesan-master se angreji main kaha, yah dibba pehle se rigerv he, yah baat jhooth he
 Saying this, he opened the name stamps and threw them on the platform
 is bich main vardi pahane sahab ardli ke saath daravaaje ke paas aakar khadaa ho gaya tha
 He had earlier made an order to order his luggage in the box
 uske pashchaat ladki ke munh kii ore dekhakar, uski baat sunakar, mukhmudra dekhakar stesan-master ko thodaa chupa or usko oot main le jaakar pataa nahin kya kaha
 It was seen that even after the time of leaving the train, another box was added, then the train left somewhere
 ladki ne apana dalbal lekar phir dubaara daal-moth khaanaa shuru kar diya, or main shame ke maare jungle ke baahar munh nikaalkar prakruti kii shobhaa dekhne laga
 The train stopped in Kanpur
 ladki saamaan baandhakar taiyaar thi- stesan par ek abengali naukar unako utaarne kaa praytn karne laga
 Then the mother could no longer live
 poocha, tumhaara naam kya he, beti?ladki boli, meraa naam kalyani he
 Hearing this, both mother and i were shocked
 tumhaare pita- ve yahaan doctor hai unka naam shambhunath sen he
 Only then did she get off
 upsanhaarmama ke nishedh ko amaanya karke mata kii ajna thukrakar main ab kanpur aa gaya hum
 Kalyani has met her father and Kalyani
 haath jode hai, sir jhukaaya he, shambhunath babu kaa hriday pighla he
 Kalyani says, i will not marry
 maine poocha, kyon?usne kaha, matra-ajna
 When done! Are there matulas on this side as well? Later understood, it is mother land
 vah sambandh tut jane ke baad se kalyani ne ladakiyon ko shiksha dene kaa vrath grahan kar liya he
 But i could not give up hope
 vah swar mere hriday main aaj bhi gunj rahaa he- vah maano koi us paar kii vanshi ho- meri duniya ke baahar se ai thi, mujhe saare jagat ke baahar bula rahi thi
 And, the one who was in my ear in the darkness of the night, 'place is,' she became the music of my life's music
 us samay meri aayu thi taees, ab ho gai he sattaees
 Haven't given up hope yet, but left Matul
 iklauta ladkaa hone ke kaaran maa mujhe nahin chhod sakin
 You must be thinking, i hope for marriage
 nahin, kabhi nahin
 i remember, that is the place of hope of the melodious voice of the unfamiliar jugular of that night
 avashya he
 Otherwise, will i stand up? That is why year after year - i am here
 bhent hoti he, vahi swar sunata hum, jab avasar miltaa he uskaa kaam kar detaa hum- or man kahata he- yahi to jagah mili he, o ri aparichita! tumhaara parichay puraa nahin hua, puraa hoga bhi nahin, kintu meraa bhagya acha he, mujhe jagah mil chuki he
 The director of the film, Hansal Mehta, is disappointed at not receiving any award for the film 'aligarh', which received a lot of praise last year at the 64th National Film Awards
 haalanki hansal ne apni niraashaa main iske liye kisi ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya he
 Hansal Mehta has expressed her disappointment on Twitter
 'aligarh' ek professor kii kahani he jise samalangikta ke kaaran naukari se nikaal diya jaataa he
 The character was played by actor Manoj Bajpayee
 manoj vaajapeyi dwaara is film main kiye gaye abhinay ko kaaphi saraahna mili thi
 In such a situation, Hansal Mehta says that his film was ignored at the National Awards, it is disappointing to ignore his film at the 64th National Film Awards
 lekin, unhone aashaa jataai ki samalangikon ke adhikaron par bahes ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya jayega

 notebandi par pehali baar janata or sarkaar saath ai, kyonki aam taur par janata or sarkaar aamane-saamne hoti he

 Party MP Trivedi, who resigned from the post of Paryalal minister at the behest of Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee, kept avoiding answering questions on speculation about joining the Congress
 ek tivi kaarykram main trivedi ne daawa kiya ki yadi vah istipha dena nahin chaahate to pradhanmantri kabhi unase iske liye nahin kehete
 When the former railway minister was asked if the Prime Minister would keep him in his cabinet even at the cost of losing the support of the Trinamool Congress, he replied in the affirmative
 jab trivedi se poocha gaya ki kya aapke in bayanon se log hairaan nahin honge to unhone kaha, ‘yah sachaai he
 Referring to a statement by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Parliament to 'regret' Trivedi's resignation, the Trinamool leader said that he was told that the Prime Minister would never ask him to resign
 kya yah sandesh kisi vishwasaneey vyakti kii ore se aayaa, is sawaal par unhone kaha, ‘zyada byore main jane kii jarurat nahin he
 i will not do all these things
 yadi maine kuch kaha he to us par kaayam hum
 Trivedi also dismissed the notion that he resigned after receiving any indication from the Prime Minister's Office and the Congress Party
 vah is baat par kaayam rahe ki sarkaar ko asthirataa se bachaane ke liye unhone pad choda
 He said, 'there was no sign from any side
 yadi main us shaam (gat ravivaar ko) istipha nahin detaa to main sarkaar ko hi asthirataa main laa saktaa tha jo meraa kaam nahin he
 Trivedi said that he resigned because his party Trinamool Congress and its leader Mamata Banerjee asked him to do so

 australian cricket team ke upakptain shen watson ne khud ko tisare test ke liye ayogy qaraar die jane ke baad swadesh vaapasi kii raah pakad lee he
 The team management on Monday dropped four players, including Watson, from the third Test starting on March 14 due to breaking protocol
 baaki ke teen khilaadi team ke saath bane rahe lekin watson baghawat kaa sanket dekar swadesh laut gaye
 Cricket Australia (CA) has denied this
 sie ne kaha ki watson apni garbhvatee patni lee furlongs kii dekhbhaal ke liye swadesh laute hai, na ki prabandhan ke faisle se naaraaz hokar
 Watson's wife is due to give birth to her first child later this month
 australian team prabandhan dwaara apane ek aadesh kaa anupaalan nahin karne ko lekar tisare test kii sambhavit team se baahar kiye gaye khilaadiyon main watson ke alaava, james patinson, osman khwaja or mishael johnson shaamil hai
 Actually, what happened was that after the crushing defeat of Hyderabad, coach Mickey Earther gave all the players one homework, under which they had to tell about their three shortcomings
 khilaadiyon ke in sujhaavon ke aadhaar par team prabandhan agle match kii taiyaari karata
 The players were given the task on Tuesday and had until Saturday to make suggestions
 ravivaar raat tak adhikansh khilaadiyon ne i-mail yaa patr ke jariye arthur ko apana homework hone kii jaankaree de di, lekin, watson patinson, khwaja or johnson ne is aadesh kii andekhi kii
 On Monday, Arthur held a meeting with captain Michael Clarke and team manager Gavin Dowe and decided to exclude the disobeying players from the possible list for the third Test
 isaki jaankaree somvaar ko hi media ko mil gai
 After this, on Monday evening, it was also reported that Watson had returned home
 arthur ne kaha, "meraa maananaa he ki ye chaaron khilaadi meri jaruraton ko puraa nahin kar paae, jiske baad chaaron ko agle test ke liye team se baahar kar diya gaya
 i want to make my team the best team in the world
 parantu agar khilaadi is tarah kaa vyavhaar karenge, to main aisa kaise kar paaungaa
 " arthur bole, "hyderabad test main haar ke kaaran team ko kaaphi dukh pahunchaa tha
 We were discussing ways to make a comeback in the series
 hamen visheshtaur par yah maaloom tha ki hamaari team kahaan par hai or shrinkhalaa main kaise vaapasi karegi
 Unfortunately these four did not follow discipline
 " a CA spokesman has said that Watson's wife is pregnant and soon to be a mother
 watson unki dekhbhaal ke liye hi swadesh laute hai
 He has nothing to do with this decision of the management
 pravaktaa ne haalanki yah saaf nahin kiya ki watson 22 march se nai dilli main khele jane vaale chauthe test match se pehle bharat lautenge yaa nahin
 Australia's team consists of 16 players

 Wicket-keeper batsman Matthew Wade is injured
 unke sthaan par bread hedin ko bharat bulaayaa gaya he
 Whether or not Wade will play in the third Test will be decided at the last minute
 tippaniyan Pattinson has bowled brilliantly in this series
 unhone chennai test kii pehali pari main paanch wicket hasil kiye the
 He has taken 8 wickets in the two matches played so far
 vahiin, australia ke ballebaaj bhi kuch khaas pradarshan nahin kar paae hai
 Now Watson's exclusion from the team may add to the team's problems
 arthur ne kaha ki yah unke tathaa captain clark ke liye sabase kathin faisla tha
 "this was a tough decision," said Arthur
 australian cricket se jude sabhi logon ke paas yah sandesh gaya he ki ham apane kaam ko lekar kaaphi gambheer hai or ham is team ko ek nai oonchai tak le janaa chaahate hai

 The CA said that Watson returned home to take care of his pregnant wife, Lee Furlong, not angered by the management's decision
 watson kii patni is maheene ke ant main apane pehle bachche ko janm dene vaali hai
 The players who were dropped from the potential squad for the third Test for not complying with one of their orders by the Australian team management include James Pattinson, Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Johnson, in addition to Watson
 darasal, hua yah tha ki hyderabad kii karaari shikast ke baad coach miki arthur ne sabhi khilaadiyon ko ek-ek homework diya, jiske tahat unako apni teen-teen kamiyon ke bare main bataanaa tha
 Based on these suggestions from the players, the team management would prepare for the next match
 khilaadiyon ko yah kaam mangalvaar ko diya gaya tha or suzav dene ke liye shanivaar tak kaa samay mila tha
 By Sunday night most players informed Earther of their homework via email or letter, however, Watson Pattinson, Khwaja and Johnson ignored the order

 The media got its information only on Monday

 But if the players behave like this, how will i be able to do that? " Arthar said, "the team suffered a lot due to the defeat in the Hyderabad Test

 All the analysis is on dialysis for the Bihar Assembly elections
 kabhi koi analysis dialysis mashin se baahar aata he, to kabhi wo waapas mashin par chalaa jaataa he
 Whose speculation will be right, the fight is about this matter
 ab ladaai endie or mahagathbandhan main nahin he
 Which Exit Poll is right? itane tarah ke riselt aa gaye hai ki main maang karata hum bharat main ek akhil bhartiya eggzet pole niamak ayog bane or uskaa chairman mujhe banaaya jaae, taaki main satyapit karun ki koun sa eggzet pole sahi he
 The comments eggzet pole ke sahi galat hone kaa apana itihaas he or aap to jaanate hi hai
 As soon as on Thursday, Chanakya said that the NDA in Bihar could get 155 seats out of 243 and the Grand Alliance had a tizzy - 83 or so - and the defeat of the victory in the world of the estimators
 jinhen khush hona chahie tha, wo to hue magar bheetar bheetar ve bhi saham gaye honge
 When Axis My India released its survey on Friday afternoon, the ball was swung out instead of in-swing, ie the Grand Alliance claimed 169 to 183 seats and NDA 64
 agar agsit pole niamak ayog na hone kii vajah se ye sab ho rahaa he
 Think NDA is getting 155 seats in one exit poll and only 64 seats in one
 ek main mahagathbandhan 169 se 183 to ek main 83
 i cannot tell if the scales are not right or weighed
 par ye zarur hua ki exis ne ye aankada apni website par daalkar hataa liya
 After the Axis withdrew from the field, Chanakya stands alone in a field that is clearly predicting the bjp's victory
 baaki agsit pole ke anusaar kisi ek paksh ke liye lahar nahin dikhti he
 It is very clear
 isliye aath taarikh ko kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 abp's exit poll has given 108 seats to BJP + and 130 seats to the Grand Alliance
 
 
 5 siten anya ke khate main dikhaai gai hai
 India TV-C voter's exit poll has given 111 seats to BJP + and 122 to the Grand Alliance
 
 
 10 siten anya ko mili hai
 Till date, the exit poll of Cicero gave 120 seats to BJP + and 117 seats to the Grand Alliance
 
 
 6 siten anya ko
 The exit poll of News Nation has given 117 seats to BJP + and 122 to the Grand Alliance
 bihar main beete 15 varshon main is baar sabase adhik 56
 8 percent polling is done
 mahilaon ne purushon se adhik matdaan kiya he
 54 percent of male voters
 1 hi he, jabaki mahilaon kaa 59
 3 percent
 to koun jitegaa bihar chunaav, jo bhi jitegaa antim rup se aath ko hi jitegaa
 Exit polls have their own history of right and wrong and you know
 jaise hi guuruuvaar ko today chanakya ne kaha ki bihar main endie ko 243 main 155 siten aa sakati hai or mahagathbandhan ko thanthan yani 83 to isse haar jeet kaa andaazi-takkar yani aankalan karne waalon kii duniya main hadakamp much gaya
 Those who should have been happy, they did happen, but they must have been scared inside
 shuukravaar dopaher ko exis maai india ne apana survey jari kiya to gend in swing kii jagah out swing ho chuki thi yani mahagathbandhan ko 169 se 183 siten milane kaa daawa kiya gaya or endie 64
 All this is happening if there is no exit poll regulatory commission
 sochiye ek eggzet pole main endie 155 siten paa rahi he or ek main sirf 64
 Grand Alliance 169 to 183 in one and 83 in one
 taraazoo sahi nahin he yaa batkhara ye main nahin bataa saktaa
 But it is sure that Axis removed this data by putting it on its website
 exis ke maidan se hatane ke baad chanakya akelaa maidan main khadaa he jo bijepi ke jeetne kii saaf saaf bhavishyavaanee kar rahaa he
 According to the rest of the exit poll, there is no visible wave for either side
 yah ekadam saaf he
 So anything can happen on the 8th
 abeepi ke eggzet pole main BJP+ ko 108 siten or mahagathbandhan ko 130 siten di gai hai
 
 
 5 seats are shown in the account of others
 india tivi- si voter ke eggzet pole main BJP+ ko 111 or mahagathbandhan ko 122 siten di gayi hai
 
 
 Others have got 10 seats
 aaj tak-siciro ke eggzet pole main BJP+ ko 120 or mahagathbandhan ko 117 siten di gayi
 
 
 6 seats to other
 news nesan ke eggzet pole main BJP+ ko 117 or mahagathbandhan ko 122 siten di gayi hai
 Bihar has the highest number of 56 in the last 15 years
 8 pratishat matdaan hua he
 Women have voted more than men
 purush matadaataaon kaa pratishat 54
 1 is only, while 59 for women
 3 pratishat
 So who will win Bihar elections, whoever wins will ultimately win eight
 agar agsit pole niamak ayog na hone kii vajah se ye sab ho rahaa he

 Amid opposition from the states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies, the Center has stepped up pressure to introduce a Constitution Amendment Bill that paves the way for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the upcoming budget session of Parliament

 This information was given by the BBC on Tuesday

 Here, Syria said the report was not credible, as it was prepared by Qatar, which assists the rebels

 Just imagine if your Gmail gets hacked, ie if someone gets his password, then what havoc will befall you? Your confidential information will be handed over to the hacker
 jab tak aapako is chori kii bhanak lagegi tab tak naa jane kitne raaj beparda ho chuke honge
 If the password went, all went! The essential emails of the office, which you kept in Gmail, the complete details of your salary slip, bank details, investment and insurance, mutual fund slip, LIC premium, online shopping receipts, EMI Details, train and plane tickets, passport scan copy, pan-card, credit-card, hotel booking, raw paper of income tax, income tax return The
 
 
 aap apane jimail ke puraane pannon ko palat kar dekhie to sahi, yaad aayega ki apane kitne raaj aap jimail ke hawaale kar chuke hai
 But keep in mind that if the password goes, all this goes too! You can be the next victim
 If you use an Android phone, then you will know that whatever is in your phone, almost all of it is also locked in Google's locker
 chaahe google plus par bheji gayi tasviren hon yaa 'google drive' main chipa kar rakhe gayi kagajaat
 Millions of passwords are hacked every day
 aglaa number aapkaa ho saktaa he
 There will be only one password for all the applications of Google, then you will know that in Google's world, the key of every lock is the same
 yani google ke sabhi aplications (apps) kaa password ek hi hoga
 Whether it is a chrome browser, gmail chat or you tube
 matlab, aapkaa password pataa chalaa jaae to pal bhar main hi ye bhed khul jayega ki offis main chupchaap aap koun-koun si websites dekhte hai, ghar main cameraa band karke kisase chat karte hai or der raat you-tub (youtube) par koun se video khojate hai
 Not only this, let me remind you that while opening the account on all other websites, you gave the address of Gmail
 yani un websites par agar 'password bhul gaya hum' (forgot Password ?) kaa batan dabaaya jaae to nayaa password jimail par hi aayega
 When so much is locked in Gmail's locker, then the question arises that did you lock your Gmail? a lock whose key is not just your password
 aisa taala ki kisi ne aapkaa jimail kholane kii koshish kii nahin, or aapkaa phone fouran aapako saavdhaan kar degaa
 This is a way to make Gmail hacker-proof
 This method is called two-step verification
 aage badhane se pehle, teen baaten bataanaa behad jaruri he
 If you ignore them, then there is a risk that your Gmail gets locked and you get into trouble
 iske liye aap khud jimmedaar honge
 You need a computer that is always available to you
 The first thing is that you can do the work of two-step verification (2-step verification) on Gmail from any computer in your home or office which is always available to you
 is conmputer ko trusted conmputer bananaa nahin bhoolen (jiskaa tarika aage bataaya gaya he)
 If something goes wrong, by coming to this computer, you can easily fix everything and if you want, you can also turn off two-step verification
 byaap email va byaap mobile number dalendusri baat he ki seoup karte samay apane jimail main ek byaap email (is jimail ke alaava koi doosraa email) or ek byaap mobile number (apane mobile number ke alaava koi doosraa mobile number ) jarur daalen
 This will come in handy if the mobile is stolen or there is some kind of disturbance in the account
 teesri or aakhri baat he ki jimail kaa tu-step veriphication (2- step verification) shuru karte hi ho saktaa he ki aapke jimail se judi kuch duusari services (jaise you-tub, mobile par jimail aadi) kaam karnaa band kar den
 Don't worry, this is very easy to fix
 thik karne kaa tarika aage bataaya gaya he or ye kaam aapako sirf ek baar karnaa hoga
 So, let's start with a strong lock on your Gmail to make it hacker-proof
