 Himachal is not taking the name of resolving the quarrel between Congress President Sukhwinder Sukhu and Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 sukkhu kii kaaryastylee se naaraaz virbhadra haal main sonia, rahul or ahamed patel ko khat likhakar kah chuke hai ki wo naa hi chunaav ladenge or naa hi party ko ladayenge

 sutron ke mutabik, ahamed ne virbhadra ko samajhaayaa or khat media main li hone ko lekar nakhushi bhi jataa di
 At the same time it was decided that after talking to all the parties including Sukhu, Shinde, they would resolve the issue but the matter was not completely resolved
 iske ulat virbhadra aankh dikhaa chuke the isliesonyaase milane kaa unako do din se ab tak vakt nahin mila
 Actually, the high command also wants Virabhadra to leave his arrogance and talk

 Gambhir was bowled by fast bowler Mustafa Iqbal
 unhone 60 ran ke liye 47 gend kaa saamana karte hue ardhashtakeey pari main aath chauke lagaae
 Manvinder Bisla (06), Yusuf Pathan (11), Ryan ten Doeshe (12) and Andre Russell (01) soon returned to the pavilion
 suryakumar yadav (naabad 14) ne ant main team kii jeet sunishchit kii
 Earlier, taking advantage of the poor fielding of Kolkata Knight Riders fielders, Lions opener Ahmed Shehzad played a 59-run half-century, he could be stumped twice, while missing his catch once before being dismissed
 unhone 42 gend kii pari main chaar chakke or paanch chauke jamaaye

 keker ke captain gambhir ne chauthe over main chawla ko gendbaaji par lagaaya lekin is leg spinner ko shahzad ne dho diya
 Chawla was unfortunate as Manvinder Bisla missed an easy stumping off the fifth ball when Shahzad was on 19
 pardaapan kar rahe kuldeep yadav ne apni chinamen gend se prabhavit kiya lekin bisla ke duusari baar kaich lene se chukne ke kaaran unke naam bhi wicket nahin ho sakaa

 com / a6kwiilxam The electoral atmosphere in the country is at its peak
 siyaasi paara lagaataar bad rahaa he or or sabhi rajaneta janata ko rijhaane main lage hai
 On the one hand, the leaders are in the process of getting the public's vote, on the other hand, citizens have the important responsibility to exercise their vote
 lekin isi siyaasi paare ke bich dilli kaa taapmaana bhi lagaataar bad rahaa he
 According to the Meteorological Department, there is a possibility of rain in the areas around Kaithal, Narwana, Jind district of Haryana during the next few hours
 is dauraan halki barish or 20 se 25 kimi pratighante kii raftaar kii tej hawaaen chalane kaa purvanumaan he
 Its effect will also be seen in delhi-ncr
 isse pehle shanivaar ko dilli main taapmaana 40 se 45 degree tak darj kiya gaya
 Now voting in this scorching sun is a challenge in itself
 aise main ravivaar ko dilli main 7 siton par chunaav he to ye bada sawaal hoga ki kya dilli kii janata badi sankhya main apane gharon se baahar aakar apane matadhikaar kaa prayog karti he yaa nahin
 In this connection, when Aaj Tak tried to know the mood of Delhiites, there was a lot of enthusiasm in them
 rajdhani ke logon ko bheeshan garmi or dhoop ke thapedo se takalif jarur he, lekin ve apana matadhikaar chhodana nahin chaahate
 They want to participate in this festival of democracy in a big way
 dilli ke ek naagarik ne kaha ki tej garmi main kathinaayee kaa saamana jarur karnaa padegaa, lekin ve subah jaldi jaakar apana vot karenge
 According to him, "summer is enough, but voting is also necessary
 ab agar chilchilaati dhoop se bachanaa he to subah jaldi voting karne janaa padegaa
 "let us know that the Delhiites themselves are aware, together they are motivating others to vote
 india get par khadey ek yuvak se baat kii to unhone kaha "garmi kabhi voting naa karne kaa bahaanaa nahin ban sakati
 Everyone should vote because the future of the country depends on it
 "ab is baat main to koi do raay nahin ki dilli kii janata jaagruk bhi he or apni jimmedaariyaan bhi bakhubi jaanati he
 But even if the vote percentage is less than the estimate due to high heat, many political equations can change
 isi baat par jor dete hue ek yuvak ne kaha kii tej garmi ke chalate mat pratishat 4 se 5 fisadi tak kam rah saktaa he
 But this is very unlikely
 mausam vaigyanikon kii maane to ravivaar ke din mausam or dinon ke mukaable thanda rahegaa or logon ko bhi garmi se raahat milegi
 Director of Meteorological Department BP Yadav says, "sunday will be a relief compared to days and days
 ausat taapmaana 29 se 40 degree rahane kaa anumaan he
 Light rain is also expected in some places
 to voting ke hisaab se ravivaar kaa din bilkul anukool he
 "let us tell you that the meteorological department's prediction has proved very accurate for the last few years
 aise main agar mausam vibhaag kah rahaa he ki matdaan ke din garmi kam rahegi, to sabhi nagarikon ko bad-chadhakar voting karke duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ko shashakt bananaa chahie

 Legendary spinner Shane Warne of his day believes that he was 'driven by jealousy' when former Australian captain Ricky Ponting criticized his successor Michael Clarke in his autobiography
 ashes se pehle warn ne elistare cook kii bhi kadi aalochana kii or kaha ki england ke captain ko is maheene ke aakhir main shuru hone vaali shrunkhlaa main jeet darj karne ke liye adhik ‘kalpanasheel’ hone kii jarurat he
 Ponting wrote in his book 'at the close of play' that he was disappointed when Clarke was not contributing much while being the vice-captain
 unka maananaa tha ki clark dressing room ke maahaul main khud ko nahin dhaal paa rahe the
 Warne, however, defended his 'best friend' Clarke during a conversation with an England journalist for Ashes coverage of Sky Sports
 warn ne kaha, main riki ke baar main kuch bhi galat nahin kahana chahta hum
 i know that he was very hurt by being the only captain to lose three Ashes series in Australian history
 unhone kaha, isliye meraa riki ke prati koi duraagrah nahin, kyonki vah acha insaan he or apni taraf se sarvshereshth karne kaa prayaas karata he
 But what he wrote about Papp (clarke) was jealous, as Papp was batting very well and Ricky was on the cusp of his career
 vah adhik ran nahi bana paa rahaa tha or pichley kuch varshon se keval team kaa hissaa bana hua tha
 Regarding England captain Alastair Cook, Warne said Cook could be negative and boring
 vah bahut adhik kalpanasheel nahin he or phir jeet rahaa he or khush rah saktaa he
 Cook, he said, needs to be more imaginative
 yadi australia acha kheltaa he or cook jis tarah se captaini kar rahaa he usee tarah aage badhata he to phir mujhe lagata he ki vah shrunkhlaa haar jayega
 i don't think he can continue as captain in this way
 main kisi ke khilaaf nahin bol rahaa hum
 i am saying what i believe
 warn ne kaha, meri najar main maaikel clark abhi duniya kaa sarvshereshth captain he
 He is quite imaginative and knows how to dress fielding for Jonathan Trott or Cook

 In an emailed reply to the clarification sought by Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President Mullappally Ramachandran on PM Modi's alleged praise, former Union Minister Tharoor said, "I have been a vocal critic of the Modi government and i hope i have been a positive critic i am '' maaloom ho tharur ne bayaan diya tha ki pradhanmantri agar sahi kaam kar rahe hai to unki prashansa honi chahie
 After this, there was a stir in the politics of the state
 ramchandran ne tharur ko bheje email main kaha tha ki party adhyaksh sonia gandhi purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii 75veen jayanti ke samaaroh main narendra modi par congress kaa rukh vyakt kar chuki hai
 The Kerala Congress president said, "modi government is unsuccessful on all fronts
" yahaan tak ki niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh ne bhi kaha he ki desh aazaadee ke baad se sabase bure aarthik sankat se guzar rahaa he
 Ramachandran said that the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) has said that unemployment is at its peak in the last 45 years in the country
 jab desh is tarah ke sankat se guzar rahaa ho, aise main pradhanmantri ko nyyochit tehraana durbhagyapurna he
 Tharoor is currently abroad
 unhone apane jawaab main kaha ki unhone kabhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nyyochit nahin tehraaya or kerala pradesh congress cameti sansad main haal hi main diye unke bhaashanon kaa adhyayan kar le
 Tharoor said that Ramachandran should name any leader from the state who has done at least ten percent of his efforts to study, research and oppose the Modi government on every bill introduced in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki vah sansad main 50 se zyada baar hastkshep kar chuke hai or 17 vidheyakon ke viruddh saahas or dridhtaa se apni baat rakh chuke hai
 The Congress MP said, "can any of my critics in Kerala say that they have done this?" He said, "I wrote my pen as a writer for the most holistic and successful criticism in the first term of Modi government And used the power of authenticity
 ''apane bayaan par uthe vivaad ke sandarbh main tharur ne kaha ki yah ek twit par bina sir-pair kii reporting par ai ativaadee pratikriyaaon par aadhaarit vivaad he
 He said, "I issued statements supporting Jairam Ramesh and Abhishek Singhvi, whose identity as influential leaders of the party and official spokespersons of the AICC are both aware of you and me
" ''tharur ne kaha ki vah pichley chah saal se daleel de rahe hai ki ‘‘modi jab bhi kuch acha bolte hai yaa karte hai to unki prashansa kii jaani chahie, isse unki galati par hamaari aalochanaon kii bhi saakh badhegi
 "he said," Modi has done very little work to praise
 lekin vah bharat main apane vot pratishat ko 2014 ke 31 pratishat se 2019 main 37 fisadi tak badhaane main prabhavi rahe hai or aise main donon hi chunaavon main kareeb 19 pratishat par simati rahi congress main ham logon ko samajhnaa chahie ki aisa kyon hua
 "tharoor said," Clearly a large number of voters thought he was working for them
 hamen yah maananaa hoga, lekin uski simaaon ko rekhaankit bhi karnaa hoga
 Yes, they built toilets, but 60 percent did not have water
 haa, unhone garib gramin mahilaon ko gas silendar diye, lekin 92 pratishat mahilaayein duusare silendar kaa kharch nahin uthaa saktin
 In his reply, he made it clear that if we will present such that Modi did nothing but remain wrong and people still voted for him, then we are saying that the people are foolish, on this stand you get votes can not do
 tharur ne party netritv se congress ko satta main waapas laane ke liye jaruri kadam uthaane kaa anurodh karte hue kaha ki iske liye party ko un vishyon par dhyaan dena hoga jinase matadaataaon kaa rujhaan modi kii ore badha
 Tharoor also thanked ordinary Congress workers from Kerala and across the country for standing by him in this 'no-talk controversy'

 K
 pathak ke mutabik, narendra modi sarkaar kii niti saaf he ki seemaa paar se golibari kaa pakistan ko munhtod jawaab diya jaae
 Excerpts from Associate Editor Rahul Tripathi's conversation with him: What is the reason for this sudden and heavy firing? We are also looking for answers to this question
 shuruyaat 2 aktubar ko hui, jab unhone hamaari seemaa chaukiyon par gole daage
 The next day was Dussehra, on that day they fired shells at our villages and we also gave a titular answer
 kuch vakt shanti rahi, lekin id ke pehle vaali raat unhone phir golabari shuru kar di
 And they fired more shells at the villagers than they fired at us
 kya biguef ne endie sarkaar ke aane ke baad seemaa par golibari ko lekar apni niti badali he?pradhanmantri, raksha mantri or grih mantri ne sarkaar kaa rukh saaf-saaf bataa diya he
 And i don't need to say anything more than this
 pakistan ne aarope lagaaya he ki bharat ne sangharsh viraam todaa jisaki vajah se seemaa par halaat bigade
 He took the first action of provocation
 hamane to bas unheen kii bhashaa main jawaab diya
 The BSF follows the high scales of fighting and we never target the common people
 aasapaas based logon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii ashanka ho sakati he
 But Pakistani Rangers directly targeted our common people
 zyaadaatar golibari ares pura sector main hui he jahaan hamaari taraf ghani aabaadi basii he
 There have been reports of infiltration from across the border
 pichley saal samba main aatankiyon ne ek sainik shivi or ek police stesan par hamalaa kiya tha
 There has been no intrusion from the border in the last two years

 But she did not succeed
 jahaan tak samba main hamale kii baat he to koi pakke taur par nahin kah saktaa ki aatanki ghuse kahaan se the
 But they did not cross the border
 kya pehle iidi blast main do javaanon ke ghayal hone ke baad biguef uttejit ho gaya or yah baari golabari kii naubat ai?hamen to kahin se aisi report nahin mili he
 It is incorrect to say that we first opened fire
 yahi nahin, iidi blast ke niyantran rekha par hone kii report thi, lekin golibari seemaa par shuru hui
 Therefore, it is difficult to find any relation between the two events
 philhal seemaa par kitni batalian tainaat hai? kya aapane or tukdiiyon kii maang kii he?tainaati kii jaankaree to main aapako nahin de saktaa
 i can only say that there are enough numbers from which we can follow our order
 ham unhen munhtod jawaab de rahe hai
 Actually, we fired more shells
 seemaa par halaat saamaanya hone main kitna vakt lagegaa?yah to un (pakistan ke) par he
 We are only answering

 This has been the old slogan of the Congress in the elections, but if you are seeking a party ticket in the changes being made in the Congress under the leadership of the party Vice President Rahul Gandhi, then you will have to specialize in the caste arithmetic of your constituency
 supreme court ne jatigat reliyon par bhale hi pabandi lagane kii baat kahi ho, lekin lagata he congress ko to jeet ke liye jati par hi bharosa he
 These days the form of candidature of Congress is being distributed in Rajasthan
 eisisi kii taraf se is baar tikat chaahanewaalon ko form bharna he jisamen unhen bataanaa he ki aapke ilaake main kis jati or dharm ke kitne log rahete hai or aapke saamne kaa ummidavaar kis jati or dharm kaa hoga
 In the five-page detail in the form, also tell which caste and religion you belong to
 is form ke har pej par jis tarah se jati or dharm ko ahmiyat di gai he usase ye saaf lagata he ki is baar congress jisaki lathi uski bhens ke aadhaar par tikat baantegi
 But the Congress officials who distributed the form are also misinformed
 jaipur jila congress ke mahaamantri vimal yadav ne kaha, 'jati-dharm ko vaise to isamen nahi hona chahie tha lekin unhone maanga he to sochakar hi maanga hoga
 Information about caste and religion of candidates has also been sought in the form
 chunaav jitne kaa aadhaar kya he ye jati kii sankhya par bataanaa he
 The younger leaders may not be saying it right, but how can Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot see evil in it
 alaakaman ne tay kiye hai to ye kadam bhi inhen krantikari dikh rahaa he
 These forms of candidature are to be submitted by August 17 to all big and small leaders in the District Congress office
 isamen vipakshi partiyon ke chunavi itihaas kii bhi jaankaree deni he
 The BJP is describing this as the real face of the Congress
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki congress darasal jati or dharm kii hi raajnneeti karti he jo behad sharmnaak he
 But the biggest thing is that these figures have to be given in the form of affidavit and there is also a provision for disciplinary punishment if wrongly filled
 aise main jatigat or dharm ke aadhaar par aankadon ko lekar ummadwaron ke bich jang tej ho gai he
 It is clear that till now, openly playing the game running secretly, there will be politics
 yah baat desh jaananaa chahta he ki kis tarah 2,645 karod ru

 Just a day before this, the retired Director General of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) office, R
 pi
 Singh had reiterated his earlier claim that the estimated deficit in 2G spectrum allocation in the manner of his investigation was just Rs 2,645 crore
 kaa tha, jise sieji vinod raay ne khaarij kar diya tha
 Singh in his remarks also pointed out that Public Accounts Committee (PAC) President and BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi influenced the cag's assessment
 haalanki joshi ne in aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 Singh's charge also encouraged Congress President Sonia Gandhi to make her first comment so far on the 2G scam
 unhone kaha ki singh kii baton se bijepi kii kalai khul gai he
 Singh later withdrew his symbolic allegations, saying that the media had "misrepresented" his talk
 lekin isse congress par koi asar nahin padaa or vah kapil sibbal kii kukhyat ''jiro los theory” ko dohraane main jute gai, jo do saal pehle buree tarah pit gai thi
 By doing this, the party opened its own bed
 tiwari or singh ke daavon ke vipareet sieji ne kabhi yah kaha hi nahin ki ghotaale main nuksaan kii rakam 1
 76 lakh crore Rs
 hi thi
 This figure was one of the four estimates given in the CAG report (see box: What the CAG Said)
 is report ke prishth 54 ko saavdhaanee se padhein to spasht hota he ki sieji ne apane in chaar anumaanon main se kisi ek anumaan ke ekadam sahi hone par koi jor nahin diya
 "it is again reiterated in the audit that the true price of 2G spectrum could have been decided only by effective market-based process, in the absence of which these (four estimates) are indicators that indicate that the government What a loss it might have been
 ”sieji apane uddeshyon ko lekar ekadam paardarshee tha
 On page 56 of the report it says, "the audit effort is only to highlight that by setting the price of spectrum through the process of open market, the price would have been much higher and the government's income would have been higher
" ”agar tiwari ne report kaa chapter 6 padhaa hota to unhone yah bhi dekha hota ki sieji ne ek ore jahaan ghaataa hone kii baat bilkul saaf shabdon main kahi, vahiin ghate ke anumaan par unhone khuli bahes kaa swaagat kiya
 The report said, "in the 2G spectrum allocation, there can be no denial of loss to the public exchequer
 par nuksaan kii rakam kitni thi, is par bahes sambhav he
 Regarding the four estimates that the auditor had finally put forth, Singh claims that he had written to the CAG in May 2010 to dismiss them
 singh ke mutabik unhone estel ke khule prastaav ke aadhaar par kiye gaye akalan ko isliye nakaara kyonki yah prastaav hycourt main waapas le liya gaya tha
 He 1
 76 lakh karod ru
 Also rejected the original figure of
 agar sirf 122 licenson ke liye dekhen to vah aankada darasal 1
 02 lakh crore Rs
 kaa tha jabaki 2007 main die gaye 35 dohari takanic vaale licenson or 6
 The loss from spectrum allocation beyond the 2 mhz limit is estimated at Rs 74,000 crore
 tha
 His argument was that the price of 2G spectrum cannot be compared to 3G spectrum
 supreme court ne 122 jiesem licenson ko radd karte hue farvari, 2012 main is tark ko nakaar diya
 Singh also rejected two of the most logical methods of the four CAG practices
 sieji ke ye do akalan unitech or swaan kii equity beche jane kii keemat par aadhaarit the
 Both sold the stake to foreign investors within 12 months of getting the license
 singh kaa tark he ki ye donon maamle vaid pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadi) ke the, jinhen vitt mantralay se sweekruti bhi mili thi or inamen nijee companiyon ko na to koi phayda hua na hi sarkaar ko koi ghaataa hua
 This argument of Singh is also meaningless
 donon companiyon ke paas spectrum ke alaava koi or sampatti nahin thi, na hi telecom kshetra ke bare main koi visheshgyata thi

 com / mmczyqmr84— Sanjay Raut (@rautsanjay61)november 14, 2019 Rajasthan BJP President Madan Lal Saini has made a controversial statement about Mughal emperor Akbar
 unhone akbar ko yon utpeedan kaa aaropee bataaya he
 Questioning Akbar's character, Saini said that he had tried to molest Kiran Kumari, the wife of Raja of Bikaner, at Meena Bazaar
 maharana pratap kii jayanti ke maukey par jaipur main bhaajapa daftar main saini ne daawa kiya ki minaa bazaar akbar kii gandi harkaton ke liye badnaam tha
 It was started in Akbar Raj
 saini ne bayaan main kaha, ''jin tareekon se akbar gandi harakatein karata tha, vah itihaas ke pannon main darj hai or kiran kumari ne ise roka tha
 He wanted to sexually abuse her
 lekin kiran satark thim
 When Akbar tried to molest, he hit the dagger on Akbar's chest
 '' saini ne aage kaha, ''iske baad akbar ne yah kahkar jaan kii bheekh maangi ki bharat kaa badshaah tumhaare kadamon main he
 Meena Bazaar has been closed since that day
 '' rajasthan bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha, aisi harakat karne vaale shaks kii maharana pratap se tulana karnaa itihaas ke saath majaak karnaa he or yah aane vaale itihaas ko prerana nahin degi
 It is worth mentioning that when the BJP was in power in Rajasthan, it had removed the 'great' in the name of Akbar and it was said that Maharana Pratap defeated Akbar in the battle of Haldighati
 saini ne kaha, ''meraa maananaa he ki maharana pratap kaa atmasamman, unki shoharat kitabon main hataae jane se kam nahin hogi
 Maharana Pratap lives in the hearts of people and cannot be removed from there
 unhen itihaas se hataaya nahin ja saktaa
 They can only remove four lines about them from history

 Some humans become God by giving life to others with their organ donation
 13 agast ko vishvabhar main angadaan diwas manaaya ja rahaa he
 Organ donation means taking healthy organs and tissues from a person and transplanting them to another needy person
 is tarah ke angadaan se kisi kii jindagi bachaai ja sakati he
 Organ donation occurs after death and sometimes even alive
 lekin angadaan ke maamle hamaare desh main jaagrukta kii kami or pichhadaapan saaf dikhaai padataa he
 Know how important your organ donation can be for the life of others and learn about the important facts related to it
 desh main har saal 1
 5 lakh kidneys are required, while 3 thousand can be provided
 2
 Patients require 25 thousand new liver, but only 800 are available
 3
 Six million blind people need eyes, but only 22, 384 people can get them
 
 
 
 Donations can be made in two ways when the cremation took place in the crematorium which took place 72 years ago- Living Donor: While living, any person can live on some part of the body like kidney, bone marrow, liver and some part of lungs
 Can donate relatives
 - brain ded:ise kedewar donor bhi kehete hai
 Youngsters below 18 years of age can register for organ donation if the parents are allowed and older
 brain ded ghoshit hone par kidney, liver, fefde, pancriyaaj, overi, garbhashay, ankhen, haddiyaan or twachaa kaa duusare sharir main transplant karte hai
 In the case of organ donation, the country is far behind in Singapur, Belgium and Spain with 20 to 40 people out of 10 lakh, in USA, Germany and Netherlands 10 to 20 people donate organs
 jabaki bharat main prati 10 lakh main se ye aankada 0
 16 people
 'bharat chodo': desh kaa sabase bada andolan, hill gai thi angreji hukuumatbharat main angadaan na karne ke peeche die jate he kai tarkajaise:- agar marij angadankarta he to uski jaan bachaane kaa prayaas kam kiya jaataa he
 - Our religion does not allow this
 - ang pratyrpan kii keemat, daankarta ke parivaar ko chukaani padati he
 - Lack of awareness about organ donation
 fal-phool rahaa he angadaan ke naam par gaiyr-kanoonee dhandhahar ghante 10 hajaar ang avaidh tareeke se kharide or beche ja rahe hai
 Kidneys account for 75% of the illegal organ trade in the world
 vahiin taskar, avaidh dhang se kidney bechney kaa kaarobaar kar, 2 lakh dollar kii kamai karte hai
 Every organ is necessary
 Tell you that in natural death, organ donation is not limited to the kidneys and eyes only
 balki hriday valve, twachaa, haddiyaan, nasen, or dhamniyaan bhi daan kii ja sakati hai
 Apart from this, it is also possible to donate liver, lungs, pancreas, uterus, hands and toes after brain death
 
 
 
 a superhero who created a spider web is not his own age, age does not matter to the binder's age
 100 saal se zyada ke log bhi apni cornea or twachaa daan kar sakate hai
 - People over 70 years old: Kidney and liver - People over 50 years old: Heart and lungs - People over 40 years of age: Heart valve Is very important
 - maut ke 6 ghante baad hriday or fefde- maut ke 12 ghante baad liver-maut ke 24 ghante baad agnyashay- maut ke 48 ghante baad kidney kaa pratyrpan kiya ja saktaa he
 If you are ready for organ donation to give life to someone, then know the first condition of organ donation
 angadaan ke liye vyakti kaa swasth hona sabase mahatvapurn he
 Also, he should not suffer from HIV, diabetes, cancer, serious infections, kidney and heart diseases

 Hence this road was named Race Course

 Such men are also very emotional

 -mulaayam ne chunaav ayog se kaha ki party ke samvidhan ke mutabik rashtriya adhiveshan main rashtriya adhyaksh ko hataaya nahin ja saktaa he
 It is mandatory to give notice at least 30 days in advance to call a national session, which was not followed

 What is the claim of the Akhilesh group? - On the other hand, when the supporters of Akhilesh Yadav reached the Election Commission under Ram Gopal Yadav, he appealed to the Election Commission to take an early decision in this matter keeping the election dates close

 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has laid great emphasis on Hindi language in the House, he talks to the members in Hindi and follows the rules of the House in Hindi as well
 unhone sansad main vidheyak par voting ke dauraan istemaal hone vaali parampara ko bhi badal diya he
 In the Lok Sabha, the speakers now use 'yes' and 'no' in English instead of 'yes' and 'no'
 yahi nahin sadan main vah saansadon ke liye 'mananeey sadsy' shabd kaa istemaal karte hai
 This is the tradition of the Lok Sabha, when there is a ruckus in the House on some subject, Om Birla is often heard saying 'asan is on the feet'
 is shabd kaa vah kai baar istemaal kar chuke he
 Actually, the posture is on the feet means that the Chairman is standing with the posture and all the members now sit in their seats
 sadan main aisi parampara he ki jab kisi charchaa ke dauraan koi saansad apni baat kah rahaa ho or tabhi agar sabhapati apane asana se khadey ho jaaen to us sadsy ko apni baat rokkar baithna padataa he
 According to the protocol of office in the House, there is no one greater than the Speaker
 vah sadan kaa sangrakshak mana jaataa he or pradhanmantri tak unhen sabhapati mahoday yaa mananeey sabhapati kahkar hi sambodhit karte hai
 In such a situation, if he stands up from his seat, then the members have to stop and sit in his honor
 iskaa doosraa pahalu he ki sadan kii kaarywahi ke dauraan kahi gai baaten likhit main bhi aati hai aise main do logon ke ek saath bolne par use record main lenaa bhi mushkil hota he
 For this reason, the speaker in the House allows only one member to speak at a time, even if someone speaks in the middle, the other has to remain silent till then
 british sansad jaisi paramparabhaarat ke samvidhan kaa bada hissaa britain ke samvidhan se liya gaya he
 Even in the Parliament there, an MP can speak only when the speaker allows him
 saath hi britain kii sansad main bhi parampara he ki jab spikar kisi saansad ke bolne ke dauraan khadaa ho jaae to us saansad ko turant apni seat par baithna padataa he
 a member can raise the speaker's attention to him by raising his hand to speak, but he does not have the right to sit or speak without the speaker's permission
 spikar om birla ne sabhapati banane ke baad sadan chalaane kii prakriya main kaaphi badlaav kiye hai
 He has clearly told the members that during the proceedings, the members will not sit in the seat and talk to each other, if necessary, talk outside the house and then enter the house
 yahi nahin sadan main nae sadasyon ko ab zyada maukey die ja rahe hai or shoonyakaal main vishay uthaane ke liye lunch ke time ko bhi aage badha diya jaataa he
 Doing so gives more members a chance to raise their issues

 The police have registered a case on the basis of the complaint, but they say that they are waiting to get a post-mortem report for further action

 Even before release, there was buzz about this film, but despite this, the film could not show anything special at the box office

 a major reason for the film's business being affected is the collision of Ayushman Khurana's film Dream Girl at the box office and the popularity of the public

 Until now, video content could not be viewed on mobile phones (feature phones) without any special features
 lekin jigsi naam kii ek nai praudyogiki ne saadhaaran mobile phonon par bhi video saamagree dekhnaa sambhav bana diya he
 Crores of customers of the country who use very cheap mobile phones will also be able to enjoy watching video content
 khaas baat yah he ki is suvidha ke liye logon ko kisi atirikt raashi kaa bhugtan nahin karnaa hoga
 However, the phone should be equipped with internet facility
 jigsi ek video strimming praudyogiki he, jiskaa vikaas canada ke toronto kii nai naveli video strimming company 'jigsi ink' ne kiya he
 With this technology, the flow of video content can also be sent over an Internet network with a speed of 50 Kbps, whereas most GPRS enabled phones in the country have an Internet speed of 60 Kbps
 video strimming or vedia ko downlod kar dekhne main fark hota he
 Under streaming, the video content remains with the broadcaster
 aap sirf batan dabaa kar koi bhi saamagree ko dekh sakate hai ise apane upkaran par downlod karne kii usee tarah jarurat nahin hoti he, jaise televijan dekhne ke liye saamagree ko downlod karne kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 90 percent of the country's mobile customers have feature phones
 iskaa matlab yah he ki company ko lagbhag 50 karod graahak mil sakate hai, jo ab tak utyub jaisi strimming seva apane mobile phone par nahin dekh paa rahe hai
 The application named Jigsy Beta will be available from August 15 on various stores such as OVI, Salemania (tata Docomo, Airtel), Appia, and the company's own website, http colon slas am dot jigsee
com
 shuru main sirf java par kaam karne vaale mobile phone par hi yah aplicoshan downlod kiya ja saktaa he, lekin company android oparating system vaale mobile phone nirmaataaon ko bhi apane phone ko is aplicoshan ke liye anukool banane ke liye manaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The specialty of this application is that even if your mobile's internet speed is reduced to 50 Kbps, video streaming can be watched without any interruption
 yani, yah ruk-ruk kar nahin, balki dhara pravaah chalegaa
 This application has the feature that if the mobile battery runs out while watching any video content or if the mobile is turned off due to any other reason, the next time the content can run from where it was stopped
 yah aplicoshan 2ji (jeepiares), 3ji, wifai jaise sabhi tarah ke internet network par kaam kar saktaa he
 35-year-old Ray Naval, founder and CEO of Jigsy, said, Jigsy is not just technology, software or mobile applications, but something more than that
 jigsi hamaara ek aisa tarika he, jiske madhyam se har koi bina kisi bhedbhaav ke shiksha, manoranjan or soochnaparak video saamagree dekh saktaa he
 The issue of changing the syllabus of the school department in Punjab was not yet put to an end that the department has now taken many such decisions, which neither the teachers nor the students are embracing
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki rajya ke shiksha mantri ko shiksha vibhaag dwaara liye gaye kai faislon kii abhi jaankaree tak nahin he
 Punjab Education Minister OP Soni said that the department secretary has drawn two circulars
 inako punjab ke tamaam sarkari skulon main bhej diya gaya he
 In a circular in Punjabi it is written that the farewell party or farewell ceremony to be held at the time of the teachers' retirement will be stopped
 kyonki isse adhyaaapak skool main students kaa samay to adhyapakon kaa dhan barbaad hota he
 At the same time, it has been written in the second circular that students of class 10th and 12th are
 unako antim varsh main skool chhodane se pehle ferewel party di jaati he
 This means that the students' farewell party will also be banned
 vahiin skool shiksha mantri ne farmaan jari kar diya he ki punjab ke sarkari skulon ke adhyaaapak apane manmutabik dress pahanakar skool main nahin aa sakate hai
 Government teachers will have to come to school only after putting on paint-shirts, while women teachers will also have to say no to plazo, capri, trousers, leggings and jeans
 saathi shiksha mantri ne yah bhi kaha he yadi adhyaaapak skool ke din aakar chandigarh main dharna pradarshan karte hai to unke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii jaegipunjab ke purv shiksha mantri dow dalajit cheema ne bataaya ki punjab main shiksha vibhaag aksar surkhiyon main bana rahata he
 Sometimes bad results, sometimes changes in syllabus, sometimes orders issued by education department to students and teachers
 itnaa sab kuch hone ke baavjood bhi shiksha kaa str sudhar nahin rahaa he
 Dr
 Daljit Cheema says that the government should focus on children's education
 naa ki adhyapakon kii dress or ferewel party par
 If a teacher retires after 30, 35 years of service
 vidaai ke taur paraskul castaff or bachche skool time ke baad 10:15 minute chaay-samose ke liye ek choti si party de bhi dete hai to isamen aakhir harj kya he
 Student and teacher have a relationship
 vidaai ke samay sirf is rishte ko nibhaayaa jaataa he
 Therefore, all the decisions of the government are wrong
 ye faisle dakiyanoosee hone ke saath-saath dictatership vaale bhi hai
 Both the teachers and the students studying in schools were not happy on these decisions of the Punjab government
 unka maananaa he ki kyonki ferewel party ek student ko 10 yaa 12 saal lagaataar skool main padhane ke baad milti he to vahiin adhyaaapak ko ritairement 30 se 35saal lagaataarpadhaane ke baad milti he
 Therefore, both the student and the teacher were not happy with these decisions of the government

 britain main purv jasoos ko jehar dene ke maamle main france dwaara apane rajanyikon ko nikaalane ke jawaab main rus ne france ke 4 rajanyikon ko nishkasit kar diya he
 In fact, France also fired 4 Russian diplomats
 francisi videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha ki ham moscow ke kadam par sirf khed jataa sakate hai
 Russia has taken this action in retaliation for the expulsion of diplomats of a former spy in the United Kingdom following the poisoning incident
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki england ke selisbari main rus ke purv jasoos sarjei scripal or unki beti ulia ko jehar dene ke maamle main rus ne abtak apekshit spashtikaran dene se inkaar kiya he
 It may be noted that a day earlier, Russia had evicted 60 US diplomats from the country, 58 of whom were attached to the US mission in Moscow and two were from Yekaterinburg
 unhen kootnithik darje ke anuroop anuchit gatividhiyon ke liye nishkasit kiya gaya
 Russia also ordered the closure of the St
 Petersburg consulate
 bataa den ki ab tak 29 deshon ne euke ke saath ekajutata dikhaate hue 145 roosi adhikariyon ko nishkasit kiya he
 NATO has also ordered the exclusion of 10 Russians from its mission in Belgium
 idhar, america main white house ne kaha ki uske 60 rajanyikon ko nishkasit karne or saint petersburg main america vaanijya duutavas ko band karne kaa aadesh dene kaa rus kaa faisla is baat kaa sanket he ki dwipaksheeya sambandh or bighad rahe hai
 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, "russia's action to expel US diplomats indicates that us-russia relations are worsening
" 'gauratlab he ki rus ne badale kii karrwai karte hue america ke 60 rajanyikon ko 7 din ke bheetar desh chhodane or 48 ghanton ke bheetar saint petersburg vaanijya duutavas ko band karne ke liye kaha he
 Sanders said, "the expulsion of Russia's undisclosed intelligence officers this week by the US and more than 24 countries and NATO allies was a reasonable response to Russia's attack on Britain's land
" 'isse pehle trump prashasan ne rus ke 60 rajanyikon ko nishkasit karne or sietal main desh kaa mahavanijya duutavas band karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Sanders said Russia's response was not unexpected and the US would deal with it
 america ke videsh vibhaag kii pravaktaa hethar nort ne kaha, 'rus kii pratikriya ko tarksangat nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Our action was a reaction to the attack on Britain, a British citizen (former spy) and her daughter
 yaad rakhe ki yah pehali baar he jab nerve agent novichok kaa yuddh se itar mitra deshon kii sarajameen par istemaal kiya gaya
 He said that Russia's decision to expel American diplomats shows that it is not willing to negotiate important topics
 unhone kaha ki roosi jasuson ko nishkasit karne ke america ke faisle main kai desh shaamil hai
 Norte said, 'we did not take these steps without reason

 isi saal 16 may ko lakhanu main vidhanbhavan ke saamne bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradesh mukhyalay main dhol-nagaade baj rahe the
 Four months later, the date was 16 in September, but this time the celebration was in the state office of the Samajwadi Party (SP), two km from the BJP headquarters
 kaaryakarta upachunaav main mili jeet kii khushi manaa rahe the
 This time the BJP lost 7 out of the 10 assembly seats it had won by stopping the SP storm in 2012
 loksabhaa chunaav main apane sahyogiyon ke saath milakar upi kii 80 main se 73 loksabhaa siten jeetne vaali bijepi baad main bhi har manch se sampradayik dangon kaa mudda uthaati rahi
 As soon as bypolls were announced on 11 assembly seats in the state and the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat in August, the party started working directly on the agenda of Hindutva and polarization
 23-24 agast ko vrundavan main hui pradesh kaaryakarini kii baithak main party ne ‘lav jehad’ kaa raag chhedaa or do din ke bheetar hi ise aawaaj dene ke liye firebrands netaa yogi adityanath ko upachunaav ke liye bani party kii prachaar abhiyaan cameti main mahatvapurn bhoomika di
 In order to give a message of protection to those accused of communal riots, the party first gave the MLA from Thana Bhawan Suresh Rana a whip in the Legislature Party and later the ZP Plus security from the Center without the recommendation of the State Government to Sangeet Sangeet Sangeet Som
 Got it done
 saaf tha ki bijepi 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hindutv or dhurveekaran ke astr kii kshamta jaanch lenaa chaahati thi
 BJP national president Amit Shah also pointed this out in an interview given to a private channel on 6 September
 ve bole “agar upi main sampradayik tanaav jari rahata he to main aapako bataata hum ki bijepi upi main purna bahumat se sarkaar banaaegi
 "now that the results are out, Yogi Adityanath clarifies the defeat, saying," To win the election, the selection of the candidate, organizational structure and array design is necessary

 vah satta kaa durupyog rokane main naakaam rahaa
 In July, communal tension erupted after the loudspeaker was installed on a temple in Dalit village in Kanth, Moradabad and BJP came to the fore
 ek maheene tak bijepi netaaon ne muradabad se lekar lakhanu tak is mudde ko garmaae rakhaa
 But in the Thakurdwara assembly by-election of Moradabad, the party had to face the brunt
 is mudde ke bahaane dalit matadaataaon ko apni ore khinchne kii bijepi kii koshishen bhi rang nahin laa sakin
 The BJP made a similar effort in Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat
 sapa rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne is seat ko khaali kar apane pote tej pratap singh yadav urf teju ko chunaav maidan main utaara tha
 The murder case had taken on communal tension after a girl was raped in Alipur Kheda town of Bhogaon assembly constituency in Mainpuri
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ne iske virodh main logon ko uksaane ke liye mainpuri main parche baante
 The strategy of mobilizing voters against the communal riots could not show color in Mainpuri as well and Teju became an MP with more votes than Mulayam Singh
 saharanpur main do maheene pehle hue dange main sikh or muslim aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 Keeping this same equation in mind, BJP had fielded Rajiv Gumbar of Punjabi society in the elections
 yahaan upachunaav main muslim bahul ilaakon main kam matdaan ke kaaran bijepi ko phayda hua
 Professor of Political Science at Lucknow University, Dr
 ramesh dikshit kehete hai, “bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke janamat ko samajhane main bhul kar baithi
 The public liked Modi's development model, but in the by-election, the party was polarized
 puraani galati na doharaate hue sapa is baar vikaas ke mudde lekar saamne thi
 "the caste equation could not be achieved
 Despite not contesting the election of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in the by-elections, there was a possibility of Jat voters going to BJP in western UP, but the party could not establish a balanced equation at the local level
" bagpat se ralod ke netaa kaushalendra singh kehete hai, “ralod ke rashtriya adhyaksh ajit singh kii nai dilli sthit sarkari kothi ko lekar bijepi sarkaar ne jis tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya he, usase jat birdari main bahut naaraazgi he
 "the bjp's strategy to take advantage of not fighting the BSP also did not work
 party ne sabhi surakshit 17 siton par jite saansadon ko upachunaav main prachaar kaa jimmaa saunpa tha, lekin koi bhi daliton ko party ke paksh main lamaband nahin kar sakaa
 Mulayam's skill In the Lok Sabha elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav stunned everyone with his political skills by winning 8 out of 11 assembly seats and one Lok Sabha seat in the by-election
 yah kuch vaisaa hi tha, jaise babari masjid dhwans ke baad 1993 main hue chunaav main mulaayam ne jaateey samikarnon kaa taana-bana bunakar bijepi ko satta se dur kar diya tha
 The sp's ground management was clearly visible in the Hamirpur and Charkhari assembly seats of Bundelkhand
 sapa ne khanan mantri gayatri prasad prajapati ko in do siton kaa prabharee banaaya tha
 She handed over the campaign for the campaign in Muslim-dominated villages to UP Women's Commission chairperson Zarina Usmani and "UP Agro and Seat Authority" chairman Zafar Masood Kichhachavi
 isi daanv ne upachunaav main sapa kii cycle bundelkhand kii un siton par bhi dauda di, jahaan 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party tisare number par thi
 It was Mulayam's political vision that got bsp's Nanpara convenor Bansidhar Buddhist to join the party four days before nomination for the Balha Assembly seat in Bahraich and announced him as the candidate on the eve of the last day of nomination
 maaya kaa fail formulabspi adhyaksh ko 13 sitambar ko hue upachunaav main yah andaja ho gaya tha ki nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko party kaa vot transfar karne kii unki ranneeti fail ho gai he
 The very next day, Mayawati for the second time after the Lok Sabha elections dissolved the bsp's committees from district to booth and also reshuffled the zonal coordinators
 mayawati, jo itani jaldi apane faisle badalane ke liye nahin jaani jaatin, main achaanak aayaa yah badlaav loksabhaa chunaav or upachunaav main party se jude kor dalit aadhaar ke darkane se paidaa hua he
 After not raising the BSP candidate in the by-election, Mayawati had given a message to party supporters to vote for the party-backed Independent candidate
 sabhi 11 vidhansabha siton par bispi samarthit nirdaleey ummidavaaron kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa he (dekhen box)
 The results of the by-election, however, are lessons for all political parties
 shahari siton par sapa kamjor dikhi to bijepi ke hindutv card kaa rang ud gaya
 If the BSP has a challenge to stop its core voters from being shattered, then the dead Congress is expected to Sanjeevani

 Confidential US documents released by wikileaks reveal that the US analyzed India's future military plans under the code 'cold Start'
 gargian akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik ek america sandesh main kaha gaya, ‘mishan kaa yah maananaa he ki bharat ko sambhavat: mishrit parinaam milenge
 Despite the initial growth, the Indian Army may have to face major problems due to logistical difficulties and the slow movement of the Kumuk
 ’bharat main america ke rajdoot tim romar ne farvari main aagaah kiya tha ki bharat dwaara ‘cold start’ kii shuruyaat kiye jane se maamla ‘parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal’ tak ja saktaa he
 This may be the first use of nuclear weapons in the world after Hiroshima and Nagasaki
 unhone kaha tha, ‘ni:andeh bhartiya netaa yah mahasoos karte hai ki ‘cold start’ parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istemaal hue bina simit tareeke se pakistan ko dandit karne ke liye he lekin ve ise lekar aashwast nahin ho sakate ki pakistani netaa is tarah ke hathiyaaron ke istemaal main sanyam baratenge
 US diplomats present in Pakistan were told that Pakistan is working on making small strategic nuclear weapons that can be used against Indian troops during the war
 dainik dwaara prakashit ek sandesh ke mutabik pakistani adhikariyon ne kaha, ‘is tarah ke hathiyaaron ke liye vikhandaneey saamagree ke vyapak bhandar kii aavashyaktaa he
 There is a strategic view that Pakistan is moving towards becoming a major nuclear force, for which it needs a large amount of fissile material
 ’america kaa ek varisht khufia adhikari pakistan ko lekar lagaataar ashankit tha
 According to a leaked US document, South Asia Affairs National Intelligence Officer Peter levoy concluded in 2008 that nuclear-rich Pakistan's economy was in 'danger' and could lose complete control of Pashtun areas in the next few years
 unhone kaha tha ki pakistan ke ek tihaai se adhik log berozegaar hai
 Levoy said, 'pakistan's population is less educated
 desh ke paas logon kii suvidhaon ke liye urja or svachh jal kaa abhaav he
 a few months later, in April 2009, US official Annie Patterson feared something less and said that Pakistan was not a 'failed nation'
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin iske baavjood ham maanate hai ki pakistan ke saamne khatarnaak chunautiyaan hai
 The government is losing more and more areas every day to foreign and domestic terrorist groups and the law and order situation is deteriorating
 ’li hue ek sandesh ke anusaar bharat main america rajdoot timothy romar ne kaha ki yadi vartmaan paristhitiyon main bhartiya sena ‘cold start’ ke siddhant ko karyanvit karti he to iske ‘mishrit parinaam’ hasil honge jis par desh main aam raay nahin he or jise pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne puri tarah angikaar nahin kiya he
 a message written on 16 February with Roemer's signature stated that the 'cold start' doctrine of the Indian Army is a mixture of myth and reality and may never be used on the battlefield due to necessary and serious resource constraints
 But it is a development tactical attack plan that was announced in 2004 and can be implemented within 72 hours during a crisis
 ’isamen kaha gaya, ‘cold start samgr hamale yaa pakistan par kabje kii yojana nahin he
 Instead of 'it said in the message' it aims to punish Pakistan swiftly by infiltrating into Pakistani territory for a quick and definite distance without threatening Pakistani existence or inciting nuclear war in the event of a Pakistan-related terrorist attack on India
 Is a call
 sandesh main kaha gaya ‘cold start kii ghoshnaa 2004 main bhaajapa nit sarkaar dwaara kii gai thi lekin manmohan sarkaar ne ise saarvajanik rup se angikaar nahin kiya or pakistan dwaara parmaanu hathiyaaron ke istemaal par bharat sarkaar kii anischitata ke chalate ho saktaa he ki koi bhi sarkaar bhavishya main ise karyanvit na kare
 It said that if the Indian government implements 'cold start' among the current capabilities of the Indian Army, the American mission collectively believes that it will yield mixed results
 sandesh main kaha gaya ‘bharat sarkaar navambar 2008 ke bheeshan mumbai hamalon ke baad bhi cold start lagu karne main vifal rahi jisase ise kisi bhi rup main shuru karne ko lekar bharat sarkaar kii ichha par sawaal khadey hote hai
 'it said' Pakistan has known about Cold Start since 2004 but despite this information, it did not appear that they want to stop terrorist attacks against India

 a person who has reached the age of marriage thinks about it
 kehete hai pyaar-mohabbat kii koi umr nahin hoti or ye bhi sach he ki aaj vaqt kaaphi badal gaya he
 Freedom of thought has taken humans far ahead
 aaj ke daur par adhiktar log apana jivan-saathi khud chunanaa pasand karte he
 By the way, it has been a different thing that for a successful marital life, whether marriage is a love marriage or arrange, it does not have much effect, nor can the authenticity of marriage be known through love or arrange
 donon hi baraabar ke str par he
 But even today, every person wants to know someone well before making him their life partner, after all the question is about living together for the whole life
 prem vivaah ke achook upayhamare bhartiya samaaj prem vivaah ko utani swatantraaa ke saath log sweekaar nahin kar pate
 Talk, read, write and people with changing thinking with time, love marriage is no longer an issue for such people
 lekin aaj bhi bahut se madhyam varg ke parivaar main maan-baap apane beti-betaa ke liye khud hi uskaa jivan-saathi dekhte hai

 So let us tell you some measures on this issue, which you will get success by doing
 aap apane premi ko lekar man me sahi vichaar rakhte hue “’ lakshmi narayanaay namah’” mantra kaa jaap karen
 Before starting the chant, put the idol or photo of Lord Vishnu and Maa Lakshmi in front of you and use a rhinestone garland for chanting
 saath hi dhyaan rakhe shukla paksh ke guuruuvaar ko is mantra kaa jaap shuru karen
 By doing this you will be able to attract the person with whom you want to marry love
 ek doosraa mantra bhi he, jiskaa jaap shuru karne se pehle apane premi yaa premika kaa dhyaan man main rakhte hue, bhagwaan shrikrishna kii aradhana karte hue is mantra kaa jaap shuru karen
 Which is: "" Keshavi Keshavaradhya Kishori Keshavastuta, Rudra Rupa Rudra Murthy: Rudrani Rudra Deity
 “” aisa karne se prem vivaah main safalataa milti he
 Every Friday, you sit in front of radha-krishna's statue and chant the above-mentioned mantra 108 times
 teen maah tak aisa karne par aapako iskaa asar dikhne lagegaa va prem-vivaah main aane vaale tamaam pareshaaniyaan dur hone lagengi
 We all have seen that people who have a desire for love marriage, make every effort that their families agree or how to correct the bad yoga in the horoscope
 upar hamane aapako kuch mantra bhi bataae he, jisaki madad se prem vivaah me safal hote he
 Apart from all this, lovers and girlfriends have often been seen resorting to palmistry
 ham aapako bataa de ki vaise to insaan kii hatheli par bahut si hi rekhaae nazar aati he, par vivaah rekha sabase choti ungali jisko aap little figure kehete hai- ke neeche vaale bhaag me aadi sthiti me hoti he
 The part under the little finger is called Mount of Mercury
 vaise aapaki hatheli me ek se zyada vivaah rekha bhi ho sakati he or agar vivaah rekha spasht va lalima liye hue dikh rahi he to us vyakti kaa vaivaahik jivan atyant sukhmay hota he
 You can meet an expert who has knowledge of hand lines and understand this issue better
 iske alaava aakhir kaise janm kundali ke madad se aap jaanate he ki prem vivaah kaa yoga ban rahaa he yaa nahin
 So tell that the fifth and seventh house of your horoscope has an important place in love marriage
 panchmesh evam sapthamesh kii yuti kaa pancham yaa saptam bhav main hona yaa phir donon kaa raashi parivartan karnaa, prem vivaah kii sambhaavna darshata he
 Similarly, changing the place of Lagnesh and Saptamesh is also the reason for love marriage
 aapaki kundali agar ye dikhaati he ki aapke lagn me lagnesh va chandramaa he- to yahi aapkaa prem vivaah hoga
 If there is a seventh moon and moon in the seventh, then love can also be married
 aap prem vivaah kii safalataa ke liye aap kuch anya upaay bhi kar sakat he jaise kii shukr dev kii puja karnaa na bhuule, saath hi panchmesh evam sapthamesh kii bhi puja karte hue aap ek panchmesh ratna dhaaran karen
