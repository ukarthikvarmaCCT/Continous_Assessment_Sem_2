 Unemployment has made the movement very creative, but the governments that are there have no effect
 harsha kii jaankaree ke mutabik rajasthan main do lakh 44 hazaar pad khaali hai
 The government promises that 95,667 jobs will be provided by the end of this year
 is vaade ke anusaar bhi sava lakh pad khaali rah jate hai
 What about many students who are waiting for the joining letter by taking exams
 us par sarkaar kaa kya kamitment he
 Students want to know this
 adalati chakkar main atake hone kaa bahaanaa bahut vaazib nahin lagata
 The government and the selection commission may request the courts to demand a quick verdict so that the lives of the students are not ruined
 jis rajya main 70 hazaar se adhik pad court main atake hon vahaan haahaakaar much janaa chahie
 This shows how bad the court is
 nishchit rup se jajon kii sankhya kam hogi
 Number of cases more
 isi kaa nateeja janata bhugat rahi he
 Will the Rajasthan government answer that in 2016, the Police Inspector's forms were filled, why the examination has not been done yet
 harsha kii jaankaree chaunkaane vaali he
 428 crores have been returned to the exchequer as a fee for several examinations
 berojgaaron kii jeb se kya shandaar kamai he
 Do not give jobs, earn 428 crores from them
 tippaniyan This letter may be the result of our job series
 hamane anthve ank main dikhaaya tha ki rajasthan main data entry operator kaa imtahaan june july 2017 main paas kar chaatr jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When we showed up in the job series, now we have started getting appointment letters
 kaayade se sarkaar ko is ek saal kaa bhi vetan dena chahie
 999 data entry operators have started getting the letter
 aap sab ko badhai
 The Hindus will keep their pledge not to do so

 After our job series, students say that joining letter started getting
 naukari series ke tahat jo data sangrah ho rahaa he naujavaanon ko maansik yatnaa dene kaa use lekar koi bhi acha shodh prabandh likh saktaa he
 Letters of assistant engineers of Uttar Pradesh have been received
 inhone pariksha paas kii, naukari jwine kii magar sab barkhaast ho gaye
 The court said that they should be restored but they are not being restored yet
 aakhir kya vajah he ki har rajya main aisa ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, you see these pictures which have come from Rajasthan
 berojgaar chaatr kis tarah pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Pakoda has entered their slogan, but why is no one taking these protests in a peaceful manner seriously
 kya netaaon ko hindu muslim taapic par itnaa bharosa ho gaya he ki ye noujvaan naukari chhodkar phir bahak jaaenge
 In this video, the girls are starting to fall on the minister's feet
 panchayat raaj mantri rajendra rathod ke charnon main gir rahi hai taaki mantri ji jaage
 They demand that the pending recruitments of Panchayati Raj be filled
 nange badan naujavaanon kaa yah march ajmer kaa he jo upachunaav ke vakt niklaa tha
 They were organizing a march to recruit third grade teachers
 berojgaare ne andolan ko kitna rachanaatmak bana diya he, magar jo sarkarein hai un par koi asar nahin padataa he
 According to the information of Harsha, two lakh 44 thousand posts are vacant in Rajasthan
 sarkaar kaa vaada he ki is saal ke ant tak 95,667 naukariyaan di jaaengi
 According to this promise, 1
25 million posts remain vacant
 bahut se chaatr jo pariksha lekar jwining letters kaa intazaar kar rahe hai unka kya
 What is the commitment of the government on that? chaatr ye jaananaa chaahate hai
 The excuse of being stuck in a court affair does not seem very reasonable
 sarkaar or chayan ayog chaahe to adaalaton se guzarish kar jaldi faisle kii maang kar sakate hai taaki chaatro kaa jivan barbaad na ho
 There should be chaos in the state where more than 70 thousand posts are stuck in the court
 yah bataata he ki court kii haalat kitni kharaab he
 Certainly the number of judges will be less
 cese kii sankhya zyada
 The public is suffering as a result of this
 kya rajasthan sarkaar is baat kaa jawaab degi ki 2016 main police inspector ke farm bhare gaye the, abhi tak pariksha kyon nahin hui he
 Harsha's information is shocking
 kai sari parikshaon ke shulk ke rup main sarkaar ke khajaane main 428 karod waapas aa gaye hai
 What a great earning from the pockets of the unemployed
 naukari na do, unase 428 karod kama lo
 The comments yah chitthee hamaari naukari series kaa parinaam ho sakati he
 We had shown in the ninth issue that the students were waiting for joining letter after passing the examination of data entry operator in Rajasthan in june-july 2017
 jab hamane naukari series main dikhaaya to ab jaakar apointment letters milane shuru ho hue hai
 As a rule, the government should also pay this one year
 999 data entry operator ko letters milanaa shuru ho gaya he
 Congratulations to all of you
 hindu muslin na karne ke apane pran par kaayam rahiega
 Do not take dowry
 hamaari naukari series ke baad chaatro kaa kahana he ki jwining letters milanaa shuru ho gaya
 Anyone can write a good dissertation about the mental torture of the young people who are collecting data under the job series
 uttar pradesh ke sahaayak abhiyantaaon ke patr mili hai
 He passed the examination, joined the job but all got dismissed
 adaalat ne kaha ki inhen behaal kiya jaae magar abhi tak inaki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 After all, what is the reason that this is happening in every state
 harsha kii jaankaree ke mutabik rajasthan main do lakh 44 hazaar pad khaali hai
 The government promises that 95,667 jobs will be provided by the end of this year
 is vaade ke anusaar bhi sava lakh pad khaali rah jate hai

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, there seems to be a huge reshuffle in the political equations of Bihar
 kuch partiyon ke bheetar hi bagawati bigul or 'kunmunaahat' sunai pad rahi he, to kuch 'siyaasi lote' idhar se udhar dhanakane ke liye sahi maukey kii talash kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the politics that is boiling is making you feel the heat even in winter
 bihar kii badi partiyaan or uske karta-dharta kya sochate hai, raajnneeti kii gaadi kis disha main aage ja rahi he, votaron kaa man-mizaaj kaisaa he, isaki padtaal sateekta or nishpakshta se kiye jane kii darkaar lajimi hi he
 Here we are presenting the second installment of 'bihar diary before election' by independent journalist Sushant Jha from Bihar
 unke chunavi vishleshan ko aap anya kai kishton main chutile andaaj main pard sakenge

 ''sharad yadav naak ragadkar rah gaye, nitish ne rajyasabha nahin diya
 The same happened to Guru George in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 ab sharadji ko dar he ki kahin madhepura main tisare number par khet na ho jaaen, kyonki madhepura kaa 'bhugol' or 'itihaas' donon badal chukaa he or nae yadav kuker bhagava safa pahanakar taal thok rahe hai
 In such a situation, if Sharadji declares not to contest the Lok Sabha elections, it is no surprise
 2016 ke rajyasabha kii aas ho sakati he
 "" Sharadji, Baji missed out at the same time when Nitish parted ways with the BJP
 ve us samay chaahate to jad(you) main baghawat karwaakar apni marji kaa siem banavaa sakate the
 Now they do not have much left to give to Nitish or snatch it from Nitish
 lekin yadav khopadi pichley 40 saal se bina janaadhar ke bhi kamaal karti ai he
 As a precaution, we are not rejecting them right now
 ''2
 Shivanand, NK Singh and Sabir Ali were asked to fight the Lok Sabha
 shivanand jaanate hai ki baxur main ve jagadanand or lalamuni choube ke bich pis jaaenge
 Whatever favor boyhood has given Nitish
 baba ke naam par vot milegaa nahin or ve chanda laa nahin sakate
 NK Singh was the fund razor, but this time his Seth is chanting modi-modi
 aise main unki upyogita bachi nahin or vaise bhi jad(you) main chunaav ladane 'laayak' rajputon kaa tota he
 So they have been asked to fight Banka, from where they are not ready to be martyred in front of Putul Singh
 vaise bhi donon pariwaron ke bich madhur sambandh hai (haalanki siyasat main iskaa bahut matlab nahin)
 "" It is a matter of Sabir Ali, sabir-thaliwale is the leader
 jitna 'invest' kiya tha, utana vakt rajyasabha main kaat chuke hai
 Now there is no escape in fighting Shivhar or Sitamarhi, although the wicket is very weak
 sitamarhi main yadavon kaa itihaas rahaa he
 In such a situation, in the battle of Yadav and JD (U) Muslim of RJD, any Baniya / Savarna or Yadav leader of BJP will take the seat comfortably
 shivahar main banie or rajput prabal hai, haalanki musalmaan bhi 18 fisadi hai

 Joint Registrar of High Court Anil Kumar Sisodia reserved the verdict on February 3 on the issue of whether the answers were considered or not

 ) Both Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen have arrived in India
 sansad main videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha he ki unhen sajaa-e-maut nahin hogi
 The deadline of the Supreme Court for the return of both Italian accused marines to India ends on Friday
 donon nausainik special vimaan se shuukravaar bharat pahunche
 With this, this big diplomatic victory of India
 italy kii sarkaar ne kaha he ki do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aarope kaa saamana kar rahe apane do marinon ko vah bharat waapas bhejegi
 Italy's announcement is in sharp contrast to its earlier decision by the Foreign Ministry, which stated that the two accused naval men would not be sent back to India
 gauratlab he ki messimilieno lator or sailvator jirone naam ke donon marinon ko italy ke chunaavon main matdaan ke liye swadesh jane kii anumati di gayi thi lekin is shart par ki ve mukademe kaa saamana karne ke liye 22 march tak bharat laut jaaenge
 In February last year, the two marines allegedly shot and killed two fishermen near the Kerala coast
 italy kii daleel he ki ek antarrashtriya samudri lut virdohi abhiyaan ke dauraan antarrashtriya jal kshetra main goliyaan chalin or isliye is maamle main isamen italy kaa adhikaar-kshetra hona chahie tha
 Earlier, Congress President Sonia Gandhi had expressed her anger at Italy, saying that Italy should fulfill the promise made to the Supreme Court regarding its two marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen
 sonia ne yah baat congress sansadeey dal kii baithak main party ke saansadon se kahi
 On March 14, the Supreme Court said that the Italian ambassador cannot leave the country without his permission
 court ne somvaar ko jari ek anya aadesh main prashasan se yah sunishchit karne ko kaha ki italy ke rajdoot danniel mensini desh chhodkar na ja paaen
 The Supreme Court order came after Italy refused to send nine of its soldiers to India, who are on trial in connection with the killing of two Indian fishermen here
 court ne aaropee nau sainikon ko apane desh ke aam chunaav main bhaag lene ke liye jane kii anumati di thi
 Italian ambassador to India, Mensini, then assured the court that the accused would return here after participating in the naval election
 lekin beete saptaah italy ne isse inkaar kar diya
 The BJP government in Karnataka seems to be plunged into a deep crisis following the resignation of two ministers, supporters of former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa and the resignation of 13 mlas, including him, from the assembly
 lok nirmaan mantri siem udaasi or urja mantri shobhaa karandalaaje ne mukhyamantri jagadish shettar ko apana istipha saunp diya
 Hours later, both of them along with 11 other mlas went to the office of the Speaker to submit their resignations
 jab ye sabhi vidhayak istipha dene gaye, tab na to vidhansabha adhyaksh keji bopaiya or na hi vidhansabha sachiv omprakash maujuud the
 The legislators waited for about an hour, after which the angry Yeddyurappa reached there and said that the Shettar government had come in a minority
 bopaiya shahar se baahar hai
 The agitated mlas said that any officer of the Legislative Assembly Secretariat should either accept his resignation or give in writing that he is not authorized to accept the resignation
 vidhansabha ke sanyukt sachiv jayatirth galaali ne vidhayakon se kaha, bataur sanyukt sachiv main ise sweekaar nahin kar saktaa
 Please come and submit your resignation when the Speaker is the Speaker
 haal hi main karnataka janata party (kegepi) banane vaale yediurppa ne kaha, shettar sarkaar alpamat main aa gai he
 They do not have the moral right to remain in power
 unhen apni yatra rokkar shahar main laut aana chahie or istipha de dena chahie
 Yeddyurappa has also targeted Bopaiah and said that he had been informed about the resignation of the mlas and he went on the yatra
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, yah nirlajj sarkaar he
 Shettar should meet the governor and resign his government
 ham rajyapal ko bataaenge ki yah sarkaar satta main bani nahin rah sakati, kyonki yah alpamat main aa gai he
 The comments uttari karnataka kii sarkari yatra par gaye shettar ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki do mantriyon ne istipha diya he
 Udasi said that he was saddened by Shettar's attitude towards the mlas and ministers supporting Yeddyurappa and now the time has come for the strengthening of the KGP
 jab se yediurppa ne pichley saal disambar main apni kejeepi banane ke liye bijepi chodi thi, tab se shettar mantrimandal par anischitata ke badal mandara rahe hai
 The former BJP stalwart has repeatedly shown the government a finger for its stability and claimed the support of 20-30 BJP mlas
 apni sarkaar par khatre ko khaarij karte hue shettar ne kaha tha ki vah 8 farvari ko bajet pesh karenge
 This is the last budget before the Assembly elections to be held in May
 jin vidhayakon ne istife kii peshkash kii he ve hai- siem udaasi, nehru olekar, tippaswami, beepi harish, ech halppa, suresh gauda patil, shobhaa karandalje, esai chikkangaudaar, suresh, ji shivanna, chandrappa, vies patil or basaavraaj patil attur
 Public Works Minister CM Udasi and Energy Minister Shobha Karandlaje submitted their resignations to Chief Minister Jagdish Shettar
 uske kuch hi ghante baad ye donon 11 anya vidhayakon ke saath apana istipha saunpane ke liye vidhansabha adhyaksh ke karyaalay gaye
 When all these mlas went to resign, neither Assembly Speaker KG Bopaiah nor Assembly Secretary Omprakash were present
 vidhayakon ne kareeb ek ghante tak intjaar kiya, uske baad naaraaz yediurppa vahaan pahunche or unhone kaha ki shettar sarkaar alpamat main aa gai he
 Bopaiah is out of town
 uttejit vidhayakon ne kaha ki vidhansabha sachivalay kaa koi bhi adhikari yaa to unke tyaagptr sweekaar karen yaa ve likhakar den ki ve tyaagptr sweekaar karne ke liye adhikrut nahin hai
 Joint Secretary of Legislative Assembly Jayatirtha Galali told the mlas, i cannot accept it as Joint Secretary
 jab vidhansabha adhyaksh hon, kripaya, tab aaie or apane tyaagptr dijie
 Yeddyurappa, who recently formed the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP), said the Shettar government has come in a minority
 unhen satta main bane rahane kaa naitik adhikaar nahin he
 He should stop his journey and return to the city and resign
 yediurppa ne bopaiya ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya he or kaha ki unhen vidhayakon ke istife ke bare main itlla kar diya gaya tha or vah yatra par chale gaye
 The former chief minister said, this is a shameless government
 shettar ko rajyapal se milanaa chahie or apni sarkaar kaa istipha dena chahie
 We will tell the Governor that this government cannot remain in power, because it has come in a minority
 tippaniyan Shettar, who went on an official visit to northern Karnataka, has confirmed that two ministers have resigned
 udaasi ne kaha ki ve yediurppa kaa samarthan karne vaale vidhayakon evam mantriyon ke prati shettar ke rukh se dukhi the or ab kejeepi ke majboot banane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Ever since Yeddyurappa left the BJP to form his own KGP in December last year, Shettar has been hovering over the Cabinet indefinitely
 bijepi ke purv kaddavar netaa ne baar baar sarkaar ko uske sthayitv ko lekar anguli dikhaai he or 20-30 bijepi vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 Rejecting the threat to his government, Shettar said that he would present the budget on 8 February
 may main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle yah antim bajet he
 The mlas who have offered resignation are CM Udasi, Nehru Olekar, Tipaswamy, BP Harish, h Halappa, Suresh Gowda Patil, Shobha Karandlaje, SI Chikkangoudar, Suresh, g Shivanna, Chandrappa, VS Patil and Basavraj Patil Attur

 Leader Kumar Vishwas, who is angry with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), today said in the Delhi High Court that he had repeated Arvind Kejriwal's statements against Union Minister Arun Jaitley
 adaalat main maujuud vishwaas ne nyaayamurti rajeev sahay andla se kaha ki koi bayaan dene yaa jetali se maafee maangane se pehle vah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya kejariwal ne purv main jhooth bolaa tha
 He also wants to know whether Kejriwal lied before apologizing to Jaitley or the reason for his apology is a lie
 adaalat ne vishwaas se 26 april ko yah spasht karne ke liye maujuud rahane kaa nirdesh diya tha ki kya vah manahani ke maamle main jetali se jirah karnaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 After Kejriwal and four AAP leaders Raghav Chaddha, Sanjay Singh, Ashutosh and Deepak Vajpayee apologized to Jaitley, Vishwas is the only person who is facing a defamation suit
 gauratlab he ki kendriya mantri ne in logon ke khilaaf 10 karod rupee kaa manahani kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha
 Jaitley filed a defamation suit in December 2015 against Kejriwal and 5 AAP leaders
 in netaaon ne jetali par dilli or jila cricket association (DDCA) ke adhyaksh rahete hue vittiya aniyamitata karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The BJP leader denied all the allegations
 jetali kii ore se pesh hue vakil maanik dogra ne vishwaas kii is daleel ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya ki unhone apni party ke netaaon kaa hi anusaran kiya tha
 Dogra said that he had claimed to have seen the document while making the allegations earlier
 dogra ne kaha, ‘vah ab nahin kah sakate hai ki unhone vahi kaha jaisaa ki anya logon ne kaha
 'he said that Faith should apologize unconditionally just like other people
 maafee maangane ko lekar kisi prakaar kii dikkat ke bare main nyaayadhish dwaara puche jane par vishwaas ne adaalat main hindi main kaha ki vah jetali ko hue kisi bhi tarah ke nuksaan yaa kshati ke liye dukhi hai lekin maamle ke nistaaran ke liye kya bayaan den is par nirnay lene ke liye unhen or samay kii jarurat he
 The court has listed the matter for further hearing on 28 May at the request of the trust
 aap netaa ne kaha ki kejariwal or anya ne nirnay lene vaali prakriyaaon main unhen shaamil kiye bagaiyr maafee par nirnay liya
 He will find out about it and his apology which has remained unanswered
 adalatake samaksh niptaare ke liye ek sanyukt aavedan daayar kiye jane ke baad ucch nyaayalay ne 3 april ko dilli ke mukhyamantri or aap ke 4 netaaon ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa band kar diya
 a similar petition was also filed on the same day in a lower court which acquitted the Chief Minister and others, abandoning confidence in a criminal defamation case
 purv mukhyamantri je
 Just a year after Jayalalithaa passed away, 'superstar' Rajinikanth, her neighbor in Chennai's Poys Gardens, announced her foray into politics
 apane filmi prashansakon se saptaah bhar chali mulakaaton ke ant main nae saal kii purv sandhya par pyaar se talaiva (bos) kahe jane vaale rajnikant ne elaan kiya ki ve badlaav laana chaahate hai or tamilnadu ko nayaa rup dena chaahate hai
 In his trademark discrete style, he said, "I will enter politics
 maujuuda halaat ko isaki darkaar he
 If i do not take this decision now, i will disappoint people and its guilt will always bother me
 mujhe sangrakshak chahie, kader nahin
 i will supervise these patrons
 ''agar rajnikant ke is faisle ko isaki ghoshnaa ke samay ke aadhaar par hi parkhaa jaae to yah kaha ja saktaa he ki unhone raajnneeti main apane pravesh ko kaaphi hoshiyaari ke saath pesh kiya he
 "will they come, or will they not?" All these things have been going on in the air, "actually the question of his entry into politics has been in everyone's mind since 1996
 ab is sawaal ko hameshaa ke liye khatm karte hue unhone ghoshnaa kii, ''raajnneeti main meraa aana ab tay he
 i have been forced to do this through situations
 '' us samay unhone dramuk ke netritv vaale vipaksh ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya tha or is tarah se annadramuk ke paanch saal ke khaase vivaadit kaarykaal kaa ant hua tha
 His statement, "now even God cannot save Tamil Nadu" warned people against choosing Jayalalitha again
 tab bhi logon ko is baat kii hairaani thi ki kya ve vastav main raajnneeti main utarane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 But then Rajinikanth pulled back
 unhone jayalalita se sulah-si kar lee, baaki netaaon se bhi duuri rakhi or phir apane ekant main chale gaye
 Twenty-one years later, his political ambitions have resurfaced
 yah mauka bhi bilkul durust lagata he jab annadramuk teen spasht guton ke kaaran khaase mushkil daur se guzar rahi he or dramuk bhi apane alag sankraman kaal main he
 On the other hand, neither the BJP nor the Congress are in a position to challenge the Dravidian parties on their own
 iske baavjood is filmi sitare ke saamne chunauti to khaasi badi he kyonki ve tamilnadu main dravid raajnneeti kii paudhashala se nahin ubhare hai
 But Rajinikanth also has an advantage — he is seeking votes as a patron of people's faith, as did the rest of the Tamil cinema stars who became chief ministers
 saaf taur par talaiva apni public apil ke bharose maidan main koode hai
 They have given the impression that they have jumped into the fray to fill the political void, not to pursue any of their ambitions
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki unhone apana rajnatik najariya saaf nahin kiya he
 In short terms, he has asked a long line of enthusiastic fans to refrain from talking about politics till he gives his signal or announces the next assembly elections
 haalanki unke prashansak is baat se niraash jarur the ki unhone apni party ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya
 It is a matter of fact that the flag of his fan club with blue, white and red stripes in the middle has started fluttering with Rajinikanth's picture
 puure rajya main unke vishaal poster bhi deevaaron par chaa gaye hai
 It is a very carefully crafted approach that the last four veteran chief ministers of the Dravidian parties — C
 en
 Annadurai, M
 karunanidhi, em
 Yes
 ramchandran or je
 Is completely different from the path adopted by Jayalalithaa
 ye sabhi lokapriy filmi kalakaar rahe hai lekin dravid raajnneeti se bhi jude rahe hai
 Rajinikanth's entry into politics N
 became a film personality in neighboring Andhra Pradesh
 tii
 The path adopted by Ramrao is also different
 antiaar ne 198 2 main 60 kii umr ke baad telegu desham party banaai thi or unhone rajya main 35 saal tak shashan karne vaali congress ke vikalp ke taur par telegu swabhimaan ke liye abhiyaan chhedaa tha
 Analysts argue that Tamil Nadu desperately needs to come out of the tight grip of both the Dravidian parties and their casteist allies, or the influence of Tamil superstitions with limited influence
 rajnikant ne sanket diya he ki ve in sabase upar rahenge
 He has promised that he will take politics beyond the caste and religious revival that has been seen in the state in recent years
 rajnatik jaankaar en
 "there is a perception in his (rajinikanth) side that Jayalalithaa passed away and DMK leader M
V
 karunanidhi kii gambhir beemaari se ek rajnatik shunya bana he
 But only that much
 unke paas pahchaan ke liye koi party nahin he, aage badhaane ke liye koi niti nahin he, viraasat main paane ko koi sanghathanaatmak takat nahin he or is ain maukey par bhi in sari chizon ko icttha karne kii kisi jaldbaaji kaa ehsaas nahin he
 They are taking it lightly, which usually does not get down from the throats of voters anywhere in the country
 ''yah sahi he ki tamilnadu main filmi duniya se ubharkar raajnneeti main kaamyaab hone vaale netaaon ke maamle main ek shunya paidaa ho gaya he
 However, whether Rajinikanth succeeds or not, it is certain that Tamil Nadu will see significant changes as a leader who publicly expresses his faith in God and religion
 pehle bhi, raajnneeti main utarane ke sawaal par ve yahi kaha karte the ki yah ishwar ke haath main he
 In this sense, when they finally leap into the political arena, they will clearly walk away from the path of Dravidian politics by making religion and spirituality a mainstream political idea
 is disha main sahaj samvaad ke kaushal ke saath aam aadmi tak pahunchane kii unki kaabiliyat hi unki majbootiyon main se ek hogi
 Now 67 years old Rajinikanth does not appear in any hurry
 vaise bhi ve himalay jaakar filmi maahaul se aadhyatmik antaraal lene ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 He said, "before the upcoming assembly elections (which are due in 2021), i will start a political party at the right time and we will all contest 234 seats
" '' unhone ''ek sachhee, sidhi, paardarshee or svachh raajnneeti kaa vaada kiya jisamen koi saamudayik yaa dharmik bhedbhaav nahin hoga
 That would be "spiritual" politics, about which he later clarified that it would be "just and moral values" politics
 rajnikant kaaphi dharmaparayan hai or film udyog main unke mitra sanket dete hai ki ve acha kaam karne main yakeen karte hai
 To assure the people of complete honesty, he said that if he fails to fulfill the promises that his party has so far declared anonymous, he will resign three years after coming to power
 unki ranneeti banane vaali team philhal kaaphi sahaj baton par zyada kaam kar rahi he, jaise annadramuk ke khemon main kathith anischitata, dramuk kii kader takat main kathith kami or 'nirnaayak kaarak' ke bataur tamilnadu ke chunaavon ko bade tareeke se prabhavit karne vaale gaiyr-patibaddh or pehali baar vot dene vaale matadaataaon ke majboot hisse main sambhavit manthan, vagairah
 But one thing is clear that they are ready to take a direct fight with the Dravidian ideology
 bhagavad gita se liye gaye sandarbhon ke saath las unka bhaashan is baat kaa sanket tha ki ve khud ko dravid raajnneeti dwaara ek or maamuli nausikhua ke rup main samajhe jane kaa mauka nahin denge
 Dravidian thinker Periyar E

 Ramaswamy had made fun of the worship of God and identified the Gita as the greatest father of the caste system, due to which the Aryans made the Tamils their cultural slaves
 lihaaja isamen koi hairat kii baat nahin ki superstar ke raajnneeti main pravesh kaa swaagat karne vaali bhaajapa pehali party thi
 Rajinikanth's stance was like music for the ears of the BJP and the Sangh
 unki koshish yahi hogi ki ve unase bhaichara badhayen, jiske boote agle loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle bhaajapa annadramak kaa pallaa chhodkar rajnikant kii party ko endie ke daaman main le
 In this way Rajinikanth's already intimate relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief Amit Shah will be further intensified
 khaas taur par pradhanmantri banane ke baad se to modi rajnikant ke saath niyamit sampark main rahe hai
 Modi considers Rajinikanth a 'good friend' and the actor says that PM is his 'khoobkantak'
 2014 main unke pradhanmantri banane ke baad se hi bhaajapa rajnikant ko apane saath lene kii kaaphi koshish karti rahi he
 During Navratri that year, the party's state president Tamilisai Saundararajan went to his Chennai home when Rajinikanth himself was out for a shoot
 unhone us samay superstar kii patni lata ke saamne yah vichaar rakhaa tha ki ve party ko samarthan de den
 Then Modi, who had met Rajinikanth himself before the Lok Sabha elections, tweeted a birthday wish to Rajinikanth in pure Tamil in December 2014
 in sabake upar endie sarkaar ne 2016 main unhen padam vibhushan se sammanit kar diya
 The BJP, with a mere three per cent vote share in the state, is trying to ride on them by making them electoral partners in the same way as the Congress did with the DMK and the AIADMK
 bhaajapa ke liye yah phaayde kii sthiti ho sakati he, kyonki annadramuk giravat kii ore he or rajnikant kii apil sabhi jatiyon main he
 But Rajinikanth's first priority will be to make a committed vote bank
 ve apane fain klbon ko nirdesh de chuke hai ki ve apane ilaakon main rangaruton kii bhartiyon shuru karen
 They will try to connect the younger generation and first-time voters through social media by building fan clubs
 unke elaan ke baad 24 ghante main hi unki website par das lakh hit or 3,00,000 panjikaran hue
 These supporters and club members will be their core vote banks
 lekin ye kul matadaataaon kaa15 fisadi hi baithte hai, jo 2009 main vijayakaanth kii dmdike ko mili 10 fisadi voton se adhik hai
 It will be a matter of luck for both Rajinikanth and BJP when T

 dinkaran ke turup ke pattey ke taur par ubharne se annadramuk main asthirataa or bad jaaegi
 If the crisis in the AIADMK escalated, the result could be that assembly elections should be held before 2021 with the first Lok Sabha elections
 lekin rajnikant ne lambey samay se lambit sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav ladgaye se inkaar kar diya he jo khud kii takat taulne or sanghathanaatmak dhaancha viksit karne ke liye ek acchhee kavayad hoti
 He is also silent about the next Lok Sabha elections
 vishleshak bhi thode sashankit hai
 Murthy says, "rajinikanth is a lesser-spoken man, as vague as his potential rival Kamal Haasan's long and curved sentences are difficult
 donon ko hi media or vidhansabha ke sapaat or tikhe sawaalon kii garmi kaa saamana karnaa abhi baaki he
 The new generation of voters can test them before giving them a chance
 ''uniwarsity of madras main raajnneeti vigyaan vibhaag ke pramukh pro
 Ramu Manivannan says, "his simple image and background has brought him this far but it is doubtful to assume that he will work in politics as well
" '' lihaaja rajnikant ke chehre ko saamne rakhkar banane vaale kisi tisare vikalp ke prati jan samarthan bade samarthan main tabdeel hoga yaa nahin, yah saaf nahin he
 One thing seems clear, and that is the disillusionment of the Dravidian rule of five decades and the corruption and nepotism that came with it
 is niraashajanak maahaul main badlaav kii sambhaavnaaon ne ummiido ko badha diya he
 Rajinikanth posted a video message on his official Twitter page on social media the day after the announcement, in line with his distinctive on-screen style
 unhone apane prashansakon or rajya kii raajnneeti ko badalane main ruchi rakhane vaale logon se sampark banane ke liye ek khaas web portal or mobile aplication launch karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said in the video, "let us all come together and bring a good change in Tamil Nadu
" tamilnadu or tamil logon kii jai ho
 The video had a logo that became popular in his superhit film Baba with the words 'satya, Shram and Utkarsh' written on it
 abhi prakritik aapadaa (olavrishti) kaa shikaar bane jhaansi jile kekisanonko do saptaah bhi puure nahin hue the, ki kuch kisaanon ke liye duusari aapadaa ne aakar kahar barapa diya
 This time the disaster came on the administrative staff in the fields of these farmers of Kumhrar village
 afasaron or police kii aguwai main kisaanon kii taiyaar ho chuki fasal par tractor chalavakar puri tarah jameen main mila diya gaya
 The peasant women kept their hands begging for mercy for their children, but the sdms present on the spot were ready to listen to them and were not ready to stop
 dekhte hi dekhte puri sarson or gehun kii fasal ujaad di gai
 Actually, the case is of Kumhrar village of Moth tehsil of Jhansi
 yahaan kareeb 20 saal se kai kisaan parivaar ek jameen par kheti karte aa rahe the
 It is alleged that this is government land
 isi jameen par kabje ko lekar ek bijepi netaa ne shikaayat kar di
 On the complaint, the administrative staff showed so much activism that ruined the standing crops in the fields, stating the rules as Dhata
 yahaan kisaanon ne gehun or sarson kii fasal bo rakhi thi
 On Shi kayat, SDM Poonam Nigam went to the spot and ruined the crop in a lawful manner
 jabaki is fasal ko kaatane ke baad kisaanon ko jameen khaali karne kaa mauka diya ja saktaa tha, yaa phir fasal ko sarkari kabje main bhi liya ja saktaa tha
 Principal Secretary told the action taken on dm's order
 In the last days, DM Shivasahay Awasthi had immediately given orders to the sub-collector to free the land from possession
 is maamle main prashasnic amale ne sakriyata dikhaate hue niyamon kii andekhi karte hue tatkaal usee din upjiladhikari punam nigam or thana prabharee kamta prasad kii maujuudagi main tractor se khet main khadi fasal ko rond kar barbaad kar diya
 Most of the farmers whose crops have been wasted are Dalits and do not even have the means to live
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad janapad ke daure par pahunche pramukh sachiv suresh chandra se patrakaron ne sawaal poocha to unhone jameen mukt karaane ke is tareeke ko galat bataate hue maamle kii jaanch karaane or karrwai kii baat kahi he
 What is said by all, this action of farmers administration has been termed as wrong
 kisaan sunita, kusum lata or anand kumaar ne ise prashasnic taanaashaahee bataaya he
 He said that he has been sowing crops on this land for many years
 iske sivaa kuch or saadhan nahin he
 Farmer leader Gauri Shankar Vidua has condemned this action, saying that it is the taunt of the administration
 bina notice kisaan kii fasal nahin hataai ja sakati
 Farmers would not have been harmed if this was negotiated
 fasal par kisaan kaa hi adhikaar tha, jisane use taiyaar kiya
 This should be acted upon

 He repeatedly visited Bengal, held rallies, dined with Dalit voters in the slums, drew many Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders into his party and campaigned against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee accusing him of 'muslim appeasement'
 Keep driving
 uskaa phayda ab unhen mil rahaa haih bengal ke matadaataaon kaa ek hissaa jo trinmul ke saat saal ke shashan se daraa hua mahasoos kar rahaa he, use lagata he ki ab unhen ek acha vikalp mil gaya he
 Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Mamta took an aggressive stand and decided to take the fight to the saffron camp
 bhaajapa ke jawaab main unhone nayaa naaraa gadha, 'aage dilli shamala, pore bhabbi bangla' (pehle dilli sanbhaalo, phir bengal ke bare main sochna)
 The BJP appeared to be a little defensive on this
 desh bhar main hue upachunaavon main haar se pataa chalaa ki notebandi or jiesti kii maar se janata main bhaajapa kaa samarthan gata he, khaskar madhya varg main
 Taking advantage of the growing resentment, Mamta decided to contest the modi-shah duo with a call from 'chalo Delhi'
 2019 kii shuruyaat hote hi unhone hamalaa tej kar diya
 He was accompanied by leaders of 22 political parties at the United India rally in Kolkata on 19 January
 shah ne bhaajapa ke liye rajya kii 42 loksabhaa siton main se 23 jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Meanwhile, Mamta has also given strict instructions to the party leaders that they do not want to lose any one of the 42 seats in the state to help them stake claim for the post of Prime Minister
 ve baar-baar is baat par jor de rahi hai ki 'fasivadi' bhaajapa se desh ko bachaane ke liye kis tarah bengal rasta prashast karegaa
 She is trying to make the matter in the minds of the people in her state that this time the Prime Minister of the country should be a Bengali
 udhar rajya kii ab ek pramukh vipakshi party bhaajapa ke liye mamata kii mahatvakanksha par lagaam lagaana ahm ho gaya he
 Vishwanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Ravindra Bharti University, says, "if BJP wins even 10-12 seats, it will be established that Mamta is no longer invincible
" vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi do saal main hone vaala he
 "here the stakes are so high that ideology has nothing to do
" donon hi partiyaan aise pratyaashee utaarna chaahati hai jo kaise bhi chunaav jeet saken
 Sangh activist Jishnu Basu says, "the RSS has given a free hand to the party (BJP) in Bengal
 ve apni pasand ke pratyaashee chunane ke liye swatantra hai, bas ve chunaav main jeet pakki kara sake
 "such a clear instruction has gone from the bottom to the top among the party functionaries
" kisi tarah kii andruni anban ko saamne nahin aane diya ja rahaa
 The defectors are also being awarded tickets
 tabhi shuru se party se jude rahe paanch mahasachivon ko tikat nahin mil paaya, kyonki unki jagah arjuna singh, saumitr khan or anupam haajra (trinmul se aae), makapa ke khagen murmu jaise dalbadaluon ko tikat de diya gaya
 Former IPS Bharti Ghosh, once close to Mamta, has got a BJP ticket
 ghosh pashchimi midanapur main ghatal se chunaav lard rahi hai, jahaan espi rahete unka acha-khaasaa prabhaav rahaa he kyonki unhone us ilaake ko maovadiyon se mukt karaane main madad kii thi
 The Congress and the Left Front have been marginalized
 unke kai netaa duusari partiyon main khisak chuke hai
 Initially, the two parties thought of contesting the 2019 elections to prevent the split of anti-trinamool votes (in 2016, the bjp's vote was reduced to 10 per cent due to the alliance, which was 17 per cent in 2014)
 par donon main bigaad se bengal kaa chunaav chaar-koniya ban gaya he
 According to political experts, the anti-incumbency sentiment is so full that the BJP can get votes and it can have a great chance to defeat the Trinamool
 yahi vajah he ki mamata is baat ke liye puraa dam laga de rahi hai ki unhen musalamaanon kaa 28 pratishat vot mil jaae
 Analysts say that questioning Pulwama and Balakot is part of Mamata's well thought out strategy
 chakravarti kehete hai, ''mamata murkh nahin hai, ve apane vot bank ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi sawaal uthaati rahi hai
 "the old Congress leader Abdul Mannan says," BJP and Trinamool Congress are bent on destroying the secular fabric of the state by favoring their vote banks
 '' kam se kam 10 siton par sampradayik dhruvikaran saaf taur par dikhataa he
 These seats are North and South Dinajpur, North and South Malda, Basirhat, Bongaon, Barasat, Krishnanagar, Ranaghat and South 24 Parganas where bjp's base has increased significantly in the last five years
 bataate hai, bhaajapa 10 anya nirvachan kshetron par bhi nazren gadaaye he jahaan alpsankhyak aabaadi 15 pratishat he
 Says Prashant Ray, a sociologist and former professor of Presidency College, "the BJP can benefit in Hindu-dominated areas where anti-incumbency prevails, although Hindus are not known to vote on religious grounds
" '' shaayad isi ko mahasoos karte hue mamata chunaav kaa vimarsh badalane kii puri koshish kar rahi hai
 She is focusing her election campaign mainly on demonetisation, collapse of institutions like NRC, RBI and CBI and Rafael deal
 ve pehle se hi chunaav ke baad paidaa hone vaali sthiti par apni badi bhoomika dekh rahi hai
 She is trying to keep alive the hope among the voters that this time there is every possibility of becoming a Bengali Prime Minister in Delhi

 ) Film: One by Twocast: Abhay Deol, Preity Desai, Rati Agnihotri, Jayant Kripalani, Darshan jariwaladirector: Devika Bhagatstar: Two Star (**) At first sight love is no longer in Bollywood
 isliye romantic kamedi banaate hue filmmekar usamen nae twist daalane kii koshish karte hai
 But for the generation that is driven more by its ambitions than being arrested in Ishq, it is necessary to create a balance
 jo akasar filmmekar nahin kar pate
 'one by two' is a feel-good type film that tries to understand love against the dreams of the career and the desires of the younger generation
 film kii jo ekmaatr taaji approach he, vah bhaawanaaon ko samajhane or kendriya kirdaaron ko aam logon kii tarah darshane main najar aati he
 The bad thing is that the film was not written properly
 akaalpanik treetment ne bhi film ko acha nahin banane diya
 a Mumbaikar is the story of Amit (abhay Deol) and Samara (preeti Desai)
 amit ek pakaod he
 Works 9 to 5
 uske kuch chhipe hue musical sapane hai
 His girlfriend has just left him
 samaara jisaki maa alcohalic hai, behatar jindagi kii talash main he
 He needs a break that makes him a star dancer and choreographer
 screenple aisa he ki amit or samaara kii jindagiyaan ek-duusare se milane lagati hai
 This is the first film of director Devika Bhagat
 isse pehle vah jab tak he jaan, aaisha, ladies varsej riki bahal or bachanaa i haseenon jaisi filmon ke screenple likh chuki hai
 But writing is completely different from film direction
 unka naireshan or ksaa hua ho saktaa tha
 The film does not have enough interesting scenes in terms of romantic-comedy
 abhaya ne hameshaa kii tarah eemaandaaree se apni bhoomika nibhaai he
 Preeti Desai is beautiful, but not as comfortable
 haalanki saporting cast ne thik kaam kiya he
 But obviously you will not want to loose your pocket to see their work
 film ke mujeec ko thik tarah se pramot na kiye jane par abhaya ne naaraazgi jataai thi
 Looks like he was right

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has played a big bet to woo the 60 lakh employees of the country and about 13 lakh employees of UP
 yah daanv he congress sarkaar banane par puraani pension bahaali kaa
 Which has been demanded by government employees across the country for a long time
 darasal,unhonebuudhvaar ko yahaan karmchaaree sanghathanon ke pratinidhimandalase mulaakaat ke dauraan aisa aashwaasan diya, jisase karmchaaree nihaal ho uthe
 In fact, during the meeting, the employees kept demanding before him the restoration of the old pension system
 jis par unhone ismudde ko aagaameeloksabhaa chunaav ke liye party ke ghoshnaptr main shaamil karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 Priyanka Gandhi, who was reviewing the party's position in the Lok Sabha constituencies under her charge, met the delegation of the National Movement for Old Pension Scheme (NMOPS)
 mulaakaat ke baad sanghathan ke adhyaksh vijay kumaar bandhu ne bataaya ki unhone congress mahasachiv ko puraani pension behaal karne sambandhi maangon se avgat karaate hue kaha ki ek janvari 2004 ko tatkaaleen atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ne puraani pension vyavastha ko samaapt karke anshadai pension vyavastha lagu kii thi
 This is neither in the interest of the employees nor of the country and the government
 unhone bataaya ki purv main karmchaariyon ko unki aakhri tankhwaah kaa kam se kam 50 pratishat hissaa pratimah pension ke rup main miltaa tha, magar puraani pension vyavastha khatm hone se yah aarthik suraksha khatm ho gayi he
 It is a crime to remain silent outside where injustice is happening inside
 ye ham nahin kah rahe hai
 Guru Ravindra Nath Tagore had told us about ninety years ago
 shaayad ham hi bahere the or ham sirf bahere nahin andhe bhi hai
 Because we do not even see white Posh Chakla houses running in our cities, if it were visible then Muzaffarpur, Deoria and Hardoi would not have happened
 par aap is khushrahmi main ji sakate hai ki inamen aapke shahar kaa naam nahin he, or hota bhi to aapako kya fark padane vaala?jin logon se ham ummid karte hai ki vah majaboor or besahaaron kaa sahaara banakar bada kaam kar rahe hai, wo mujffarpur,devariyaor hardoi main vahshat kaa naach kar rahe hai
 And if you think that it is just three cities and your city is not included in it, then you are definitely in deception
 safedposh aparaadhiyon kii karatutakyonki aparaadh khatm karne kaa iraadaa bhi hamaare hukmaranon main nahin he
 Yes, he definitely avoids the attack on his head by saying that he should punish the criminal
 ab mushkil ye he ki pehle to in rusuukh vaale safedposh aparaadhiyon par haath hi nahin daalaa ja saktaa or agar kabhi ye pakad bhi liye jaaen to is tarah sirf apradhi haath aata he or aparaadh aaazaad hokar kisi duusare safedposh ke badan main utar jaataa he
 The question is that of these respected people
 unke gunahon kaa naash kab, kahaan or kaise hoga? lekin jab ham ye sawaal karte hai, to vah laal ankhen dikhaakar hamase kehete hai
 They say- Do not question, tie the eyes and become Dhritarashtra
 varanaa ankhen khuli raheen to kalyug ke is mahabharat main brajesh thakur jaise duryodhana draupadi ke kapade utaarte rahenge or ham pandavon kii tarah bas haath malkar dekhte hi rah jaaenge
 Do not expect from the government
 unase nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Nitish is silent in Bihar
 upi main yogi or to or
 Enough of the girls being tortured
 ab kii baar modi sarkaar kaa naaraa dene vaale pradhanmantri bhi khamosh hai
 Then what is left now? muzaffarpur main ladakiyon se balaatkarabihar kahiye yaa kahiye puure mulk ke itihaas kaa ye sabase sharmnaak rape cond he
 In which, in the name of Shelter Home, Brajesh Thakur gave drugs to 34 girls
 
 Made not only himself but also a victim of outsiders
 philhal sibiai is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki is dhaage kaa sira kahaan tak jaataa he or prashasan or sarkaar ke kitne log isamen lipte hue hai
 At present, India had not even recovered from the shock that another shelter home came from Deoria in UP
 sharmasaar kar dene vaali khabar
 Just like in Muzaffarpur, the Vindhyavasini Women's Training Social Service Institute of the disgusting Kandadevariya, the process of harassment with daughters started in the evening
 raat ke andhere main santhaan kii majaboor bebas ladakiyon ko ayyaashon kii kaaron main jabaran thuns diya jaataa tha or phir ye giddh sari raat in betiyon kaa badan nochate the
 This generosity was revealed when a girl here escaped after breaking the chains of Zulmo Sitam and she told her emergency police
 ab hardoi main ladakiyon par atyacharupi main devaria ke shelter home main ladakiyon se dhandha karwaae jane kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad ab hardoi ke beniganj main besahaara mahilaon ke ek shelter home se chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 About 19 women are missing from this shelter home in Hardoi
 iskaa khulaasa tab hua jab dm neshelter homeka daura kiya
 It was found that the names of 21 women are registered in the register here
 magar maukey par sirf do hi mahilaayein thi
 The act of white-robed babes after hypocritical babes: Now it seems that it is the turn of white-robed babas after hypocritical babas
 jo upi se lekar bihar tak or naa jane desh main kahaan kahaan
 In the disguise of the Messiah, rapists are roaming more dangerously than Babas
 jo sarkaar se paise lekar besahaara bacchiyon ko shikaar bana rahe hai
 And do not consider it only till Deoria, Muzaffarpur or Hardoi
 jaise jaise vakt beetegaa shelter homes ko lekar kai or khulaase honge
 
 mumkin he kai duusare shaharon main chal rahe shelter home kaa naam bhi fehrist main judata jaae

 The Center on Monday opposed an appeal against a single bench order in the Delhi High Court asking AJL, the publisher of the National Herald, to vacate its premises

 pawan 'jallaad' ke liye yah lokapriyata or shoharat koi nai baat nahin he, kyonki vah ek aise parivaar se aata he jisane jallaad ke rup main kai mashhoor aparaadhiyon ko faansee di he

 kallu ne kul 12 kukhyat aparaadhiyon ko faansee di thi
 Pawan's father Mammu Singh was also the executioner of the Meerut jail, but according to the jail authorities he never hanged a criminal

 iaiti dilli se mere ghar kii duuri zyada nahin he
 Little did i know that IIT students keep doing big 'exploits', but never got a chance to see
 jab mere saathi rajnish se pataa chalaa ki iaiti parisar ke andar kuch workshop dikhaaya jane vaala he, to main vahaan story karne ke liye pahunch gaya
 The duration of my story was not much, because time has to be taken care of inside a story on TV
 mujhe laga ki chaatro ne jo shandaar karname kiye hai, uske bare main bataaya jaae
 Some students complained that media people come, but some do not show
 iaiti parisar main kaaphi bheed thi
 Students from different schools came to see the workshop here
 main pehle iaaiti ke seminar haul main pahunchaa, jahaan meri mulaakaat rishabh agarwal se hui, jo yahaan ke chaatr hai
 Rishabh showed me the innovation, which i was surprised to see
 is seminar haul ke andar mujhe robo hi robo dikhaai de rahe the
 Two robo were playing badminton, while another robo was carrying goods from one place to another
 kuch robo to computer main video game bhi khel rahe the
 Rishabh said that his team of 16 students made this robo and where 85 teams took part in the competition in Pune, "best Innovative Design" award has also been received
 ab ham us seminar haul se nikalakar duusari building ke taraf gaye
 With the help of a student, we reached Mathur Seminar Hall
 vahaan dekha ki kuch bachche ek chadi lekar chal rahe hai
 We thought there is a simple stick, but on asking, it turned out that this stick has something else
 yah chadi un logon ke liye banaaya gaya he, jinhen dikhaai nahin detaa or rasta khojane main dikat hoti he
 This stick is called 'smart Can', which has an ultrasound sensor inside it
 iske jariye teen meter tak kisi bhi vastu ke bare main wibrasion ke dwaara jaankaree mil sakati he
 This stick is now available in the market and anyone can buy
 parisar main ek anya jagah par kuch kisaan nazar aae
 It seemed as if Rahul Gandhi's proposed Kisan Rally was in place
 
 
 lekin aisa nahin tha
 Actually these farmers came here to see the stuff that the students here have made for them
 yahaan iaiti chaatro dwaara taiyaar khudaai karne vaali ek mashin he, jo tractor kii tarah kaam kar sakati he
 Small farmers who lack capital can use it
 anil kumaar or laal singh naamak chaatro ne is mashin ko taiyaar kiya or isaki keemat sirf 20,000 hazaar rupee ke kareeb he, jo tractor ke daam ke mukaable behad kam he
 Now we have an eye on a machine that picks up garbage
 mashin kaaphi choti thi, lekin karnama kaaphi bada
 You can pick up the garbage and move it from one place to another through this machine
 is mashin ko aniket ke saath aayush or pradeep ne milakar banaaya he
 Its price is around 3500
 chalate-chalate hamaari mulaaqaat indra kumaar sahu se hui, jo chhattisgarh ke rahane vaale hai or iaiti main dizine ejineering kii padhai kar rahe hai
 Indra and his partners Jayanto Kumar, Krishna Kumar Gupta and Anoop Kumar have formed a multi utility chair
 is chair main teble lite bhi lagi hui he
 If you feel tired while studying, you can also rest by making this chair a bed
 tippaniyan Now we were returning, then the voice came from behind, listen
 
 
 hamaare bare main bhi thodaa bataa dijie
 This was the voice of Arun
 arun or unke saathi ne ek aisi mashin banaai he, jiske jariye aap barish se apane kapade ko bhigane se bachaa sakate hai
 There was a lot to see here, but we lacked time
 haa, yahaan aakar hamane paaya ki chaatro ne har kisi kii suvidha ke liye kuch na kuch banaaya he, jo bahut jaldi aap logon ke gharon main istemaal ho saktaa he
 The IIT campus was very crowded
 alag-alag skulon se chaatr yahaan workshop dekhne aae the
 i first arrived at the seminar hall of IIIT, where i met Rishabh Agarwal, a student here
 rishabh ne mujhe vah innovations dikhaaya, jise dekhakar main hairaan rah gaya
 Inside this seminar hall, i could see Robo
 do robo badminton khel rahe the, to ek anya robo ek jagah se duusare jagah saamaan lekar ja rahaa tha
 Some Robo were also playing video games in the computer
 rishabh kaa kahana tha ki 16 chaatro kii unki team ne yah robo banaaya he or pune main hui pratiyogita main jahaan 85 tiimon ne hissaa liya the, vahaan "best innovative dizine" kaa puraskaar bhi mil chukaa he
 Now we left that seminar hall and went towards the other building
 ek chaatr kii madad se ham maathur seminar haul pahunche
 i saw some children walking with a stick
 hamen laga koi saadhaaran si chadi he, lekin poochne par pataa chalaa ki is chadi kaa kamaal kuch or he
 This stick is made for those who cannot see and have difficulty in finding the way
 is chadi ko 'smart ken' kehete hai, jiske andar ultrasound sensor laga hua he
 Through this, information about any object up to three meters can be obtained by vibration
 ye chadi ab bazaar main uplabdh he or koi bhi kharid saktaa he
 Some farmers were seen at another place in the campus
 aisa laga maano rahul gandhi kii prastaavit kisaan raily kii jagah ho
 
 
 But it was not so
 darasal ye kisaan yahaan wo saamaan dekhne aae the, jo yahaan ke chaatro ne un ke liye banaaya he
 Here is an excavator machine prepared by IIT students, which can work like a tractor
 chote kisaan jinke paas puunji kii kami he, ve iskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Students named Anil Kumar and Lal Singh designed this machine and its price is only around 20,000 rupees, which is very low compared to the price of the tractor
 ab hamaari nazar ek aisi mashin ke upar padi, jo kachra uthaati he
 The machine was quite small, but the feat was quite large
 aap is mashin ke jariye kachra uthaakar ek jagah se duusare jagah le ja sakate hai
 This machine is made by Ayush and Pradeep together with Aniket
 iskaa keemat lagbhag 3500 ke kareeb he
 On the go, we met Indra Kumar Sahu, a resident of Chhattisgarh and studying design engineering at IIT
 indra or unke saathi jayanto kumaar, krishna kumaar gupta or anup kumaar ne milakar ek multi utility chair banaaya he
 There is also a table light in this chair
 padhai karte vaqt agar thakaan mahasoos ho, to is chair ko bistar banaakar aap aaraam bhi farma sakate hai
 The comments ab ham waapas laut rahe the, tabhi peeche se awaz ai, suniye
 
 
 Please tell a little about us

 teen kisht or chah qatl
 This is probably the most dreadful incident of Delhi in recent times
 in chah katl main se paanch ko maarane ke baad kaatil unhen do alag-alag jagahon par dafnaata he
 The distance between the two places is about 90 kilometers
 kaatil ke nafrat kii intehaa dekhie ki aakhri katl karne ke liye pehle wo apane shikaar ko tihaad jail se baahar nikaalata he
 He then performs the sixth and last murder
 maa-betiyon kaa katl kar zamin main gadaghar kaa mukhiya choudhary munwwar hasan tihaad jail ke andar band tha or jail ke baahar dushman kii nazar uske ghar par thi
 Intrigue and hatred were both intense
 jiske chalate 21 april, 2017 ko meerut ke daurala main tihaad jail se kareeb 90 kilometre dur dushman ne pehla waar kiya
 Three murders were done simultaneously in a single blow
 maa or uski do jawan betiyon kaa berahami se katl kar diya gaya
 After the murder, the three dead bodies were buried in Daurala area
 kisi ko is baat kii kaanon-kaan khabar bhi nahin hui
 The death of a mother and two daughters in Kiyareth, after killing the sons and killing them at home in Burari, Delhi, still three more people were still alive in the family
 do bete or ghar kaa mukhiya
 But the head of the house was lodged in Tihar Jail
 jise jail main ghus kar maaraa nahin ja saktaa tha
 Hence, a conspiracy was hatched to establish the whereabouts of both the sons
 donon bete kaatil ke saath khushi-khushi apane ghar se nikalate hai or sirf aadha kilometre kii duuri par jate hi tabhi unhen ahsaas ho jaataa he ki wo funs chuke hai
 Both are held hostage for 24 hours in an empty house
 iske baad unka bhi vahi anjaam hota he jo unki maa or bahanon kaa hua tha
 On April 22, 2017, both sons are murdered and buried in their house
 ab tak paanch katl ho chuke the
 Now the last slaughter was yet to happen
 perol par jail se baahar aayaa parivaar kaa mukhiyaabaat 17 may, 2017 kii he
 Chaudhary Munawwar Hassan, the head of Burari's family whose five people were put to death, was lodged in jail
 baahar ke dushman ke bare main use kuch pataa nahin tha
 But as soon as he came to know that his wife, two sons and two daughters, the whole family had been missing for a month, he suspected something
 or isi binah par adaalat ne use perol par reeha kar diya taaki wo apane parivaar ko dhund sake
 His partner Bunty helped him in this task
 ghar main ghuskar parivaar ke mukhiya kii hatya20 may 2017 kaa din tha
 Munavvar was searching for his family
 police ko shikaayat darj karai thi
 After returning from the police station, he was on the first floor of his house in Burari
 use jail se baahar aae hue keval teen din hi hue the
 Then suddenly a sound of firing was heard in his house
 darasal, subah-subah vahi dushman vahi serial killer munwwar ke ghar main ghus aayaa or usne munwwar ko goli maar di
 In this way, six people of a family are killed in three installments
 par kyon? aakhir is parivaar se us shaks kii kya dushmani thi?dost hi niklaa dushman!is qaatil kii giraftaar ke baad haal ke dinon ke is sabase sansanikhej murder mistry kii paraten jab khulani shuru hui, to har koi chaunk uthaa
 It is difficult to imagine this story of enmity between two friends will show such a bloody color
 munwwar kaa ek dost hi tha, jisane uski peeth main khanjar ghonpa tha
 Let us now tell you the whole incident in sequence
 raajnneeti ke alaava property kaa kaam karata tha munvvarek-ek kar hue in chah qatl kaa aakiri shikaar or tihaad se perol par baahar aayaa shaks koi or nahin, balki dilli kaa ek bispi netaa choudhary munwwar hasan tha, jo dilli ke hi badali ilaake se party ke tikat par 2015 kaa vidhaan sabha chunaav lard chukaa tha
 Apart from politics, Hassan used to work in property dealing and in this work a man named Bunty was his partner
 jab se hasan kaa parivaar gaayab tha, khud jail main band hasan jitna pareshaan tha, jail ke baahar uskaa dost banty bhi utana hi pareshaan tha
 With the help of this same lawyer, Hassan got Hassan out of jail on parole
 banty hi niklaa puure parivaar kaa kaatilhairaani kii baat ye thi ki hasan ke qatl ke 48 ghante guzarate-guzarate dilli police ne hasan ke usee dost banty ko giraftaar kar liya
 Yes, if the police believe it was Bunty who first killed Hassan's family one by one and finally he got Hassan freed from prison on parole and killed him too
 is kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye banty ne khaufnak sajeesh rachi thi
 50 thousand betel nut for each murder! Three lakh rupees and betel nut for six people
 yani har katl ke liye 50 hajaar rupee
 Munavvar's sons and daughters were aged between 16 and 20 years
 ab sawaal ye he ki agar banty kii dushmani munwwar se thi to uske bivi-bacchon ko kyon maaraa? to police kii maane to ranjish hi aisi thi ki banty kisi ko bhi bakhshane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 That is why he wiped out the entire family in installments
 property kaa vivaad tha dushmani kii vajahek hi parivaar ke chah logon kaa katl or kaatil ek
 After all, what kind of enmity did the murderer face with Maktool or his family? Believing the preliminary investigation results, 44 property quarrel was behind this murder
 wo 44 jaaydaad jo vivaadit thim or jin par munwwar hasan or uske partner banty kaa baraabar kaa hissaa tha
 That is, 22–22 properties had to be part of both
 magar munwwar hasan shaayad vaade se palat gaya
 The enmity between two friends starts from here
 aise hue silsilewar katl!is dushmani ke tahat pehali kisht main teen katl kiye gaye
 On the morning of 21 April, Bunty takes Munawar Hasan's wife Ishrat and two daughters with him to Meerut
 jahaan ishrat kii bahan rahati he
 But the next day, near Meerut, he kills Ishrat and her two daughters Arzu, 18, and Arshi, 17
 katl ke baad teenon laashen meerut ke hi daurala ilaake main dafana detaa he
 After this, Bunty returns to Delhi from Meerut and summons 19-year-old Saqib, 20-year-old Aqib, both sons of Munawar Hasan
 phir 22 april ko buraadi ke khaali pade makaan main un donon kaa bhi katl kar laash vahiin dafna detaa he
 The bullet fired by the prisoner, Munawwar Hassan himself was lodged in Tihar Jail on charges of rape
 lihaaja use parivaar kii gumshudagi kii khabar nahin lagi
 Later, Bunty himself gave this news to no one else
 iske baad banty ne hi uske jail se baahar aane kaa intjaam karaayaa
 Because he wanted Munawar to come out of jail
 17 may ko munwwar ko jail se baahar nikalwane ke baad agle din banty khud uske saath buraadi thane gaya or vahaan parivaar kii gumshudagi kii report likhavai
 But then two days later, on 20 May, someone entered Munawar's house and shot him
 police ke radar par tha bantiis maamle kaa shaatir aaropee banty shaayad itani jaldi pakadaa nahin jaataa
 But Munawar's relatives were suspicious of Bunty's antics
 phir qatl se ain pehle munwwar ke padosiyon ne use uske ghar aate hue dekha tha
 Even the first caller to the police after Munavvar's murder on the morning of May 20 was himself divided
 aise main banty ab police kii radar par aa chukaa tha
 On the basis of this doubt, when the police caught Bunty, he threw out the truth police ke mutabik banty ne munwwar ke parivaar ke safaaye ke liye kiraye ke kaatilon ko teen lakh rupye kii supaari di thi
 Now the police suspect that the man who implicated Munawar in the rape charges was also martyred
 banty kii nishandehi par shav baramadabanti ke bayaan ke aadhaar par police kii ek team meerut ke liye ravaanaa kii gai
 From where the police have recovered the corpses of Munawar's wife and both daughters on his spot
 iske saath hi police ne munwwar ke donon beton ke shav bhi uske ghar se baraamad kar liye hai

 kahin gan point par cash vine se 40 lakh rupee luute gaye to kahin gas agency ke maalik se firing ke baad lut kii gai to kahin par kapade ke showrooms main luteron ne dhaava bolaa
 After three reports of looting together, it is also difficult to believe for some time that there is a rule of law here, but Noida's condition is similar
 upi sarkaar chaahe lakh daawey kare lekin yahaan ke gunde badmaash maanane vaale nahin hai
 The way the masked miscreants have carried out three robbery incidents one after the other, is in itself quite frightening
 cash vine se 40 lakh kii luutanoida ke sector 82 market main bike par aae do luteron ne firing karte hue ek hi jatke main ek cash vine se 40 lakh rupee lut liye or faraar ho gaye
 The cash van reached sbi's ATM at around 2 pm on Tuesday afternoon
 abhi mulaazim vine se cash nikaalkar use atm main daalane ja hi rahe the ki bike par aae do naqaabposh luteron ne firing kar unase cash se bhare do bag lut liye or bhaagane lage
 But the same robber's bike collided with a car and a robber fell down the bike
 jiske baad ek bag se rupee bikhar gaye
 Meanwhile, the guard of the cash van also fired

 iske baad kai round hawaii fire karte hue bhaag nikle
 After this incident, the victim informed the police
 police maukey par bhi pahunchi lekin badmaashon kaa koi suraag nahin mila
 The robbery took place on Monday afternoon in the Dadri area of lootnoida in the showroom on the basis of gun
 ek bike par savaar hokar aae do nakaabposh lutere peter england ke showrooms main ghuse or gan point par 45 hazaar rupee lut kar faraar ho gaye
 The robbers also held the showroom salesmen and other employees hostage for some time for the robbery
 haalanki lut kii ye vaardaat showrooms main lage sisitivi camaron main kaid ho gai lekin is maamle main bhi police ke haath ab tak khaali hai
 Let me tell you that a day earlier, two robbers on a bike tried to rob a woman in Sector 23 and, on failing, ran away by shooting at the car
 is vaardaat main mahila kii jaan bal-bal bachi thi
 It can be inferred from these incidents of looting one by one that the law has become a joke for the miscreants in Noida and the police is helpless

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main basapa-sapa ke gathbandhan par shanivaar ko akhilesh yadav or mayawati ek sanyukt press conference karengen
 It is expected that they can announce the SP-BSP alliance tomorrow
 basapa supremeo mayawati or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav upi kii rajdhani lakhanu main shuukravaar dopaher main sanyukt press brifing karenge
 It is believed that in tomorrow's press briefing, there may be a formal announcement on the BSP-SP alliance
 akhilesh yadav kii sapa or mayawati kii basapa main beete kuch samay se gathbandhan or uski siton par baatcheet chal rahi he
 Last week there were also reports of their meeting in Delhi and some media reports said that talks are going on between the BSP-SP alliance and the Congress will not be included in it
 itnaa hi nahin, bataaya to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki sapa-basapa ke bich 37-37 siton par qaraar hua he
 Not only this, the BSP-SP alliance is also trying to take other small parties of UP with them
 rashtriya lokdal or nishad party bhi is gathbandhan kaa hissaa ho sakati he
 According to information received from the sources, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav have come close to finalizing the seat-sharing formula in view of the Lok Sabha elections to be held this year and the bus is only delayed
 sutron kaa daawa he ki uttar pradesh kii ye donon badi partiyaan 37-37 loksabhaa siton par saath milakar chunaav ladengi
 Let us tell you that Uttar Pradesh has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 upi kii siyaasi galiyaon main charchaa is baat par bhi he ki basapa-sapa gathbandhan main amethi or raibareli kii siten chhod di jaaengi or vahaan kisi bhi ummidavaar ko nahin utaara jayega
 The seats remaining after this will be left for the Rashtriya Lok Dal and other smaller parties
 yani sapa or basapa ke bich gathbandhan kii baat sahi sabit hoti he to iskaa matlab he ki congress is gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hogi or upi kii anya kshetreey partiyon ko jodne kii sapa-basapa purajor koshish karegi
 If seen in this way, if the SP-BSP meets, then the Congress will be a big shock
 saath hi saath bijepi ke liye bhi kisi bade jatke se kam nahin hogi
 To understand the shock of the Congress as well as the BJP, one will need to look at the vote share of Lok Sabha Elections 2014
 darasal, 2014 main bhale hi basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uskaa vot fisadi sapa ke kareeb hi tha
 The 2014 Lok Sabha elections had emerged as the single largest party and surprised everyone by winning 71 out of 80 seats
 us vakt 71 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ne record kareeb 42 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party had 5 seats with about 22 percent votes
 2014 main mayawati kii basapa ko ek bhi seat nahin mil pai thi, magar uske kareeb 20 fisadi vot the
 At the same time, the Congress had won the seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi and secured around 7 per cent vote share

 once again, the magic of Amir Khan is speaking to the heads of the people
 saf ali khan kii beti sara ali khan ke liye film 'kedarnath' dream debyue tha
 The film was scheduled to release this year, but the film hangs due to director Abhishek Kapoor's unprofessional behavior
 is baat se sara ko dukh to bahut hua hoga, lekin khabaron kii maane to wo ab rohit shetty kii film 'simba' se debyue karengi
 india
 com kii report ke mutabik, 'sara ko kedarnath ke alaava bhi kai filmein ofer hui thim, lekin wo sirf kedarnath par focus karnaa chaahati thim, lekin ab kedarnath ke bich main latakane ke kaaran sara chaahati hai ki wo ranvir ke saath debyue karen
 In Saif's daughter Sara's debut film Fansi Legal Pachhde, Yeh Hai Brawl, 'simba' is a Hindi remake of the Telugu film 'temper'
 film is saal 28 disbanr ko relies hogi
 What is controversial is that Kedarnath producers are angry with kriarj Entertainment and T-series, Abhishek Kapoor
 unhen lagaataar aarthik nuksaan ho rahaa he, kyonki abhishek production ko handle nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Ekta Kapoor has invested Rs 8 crore in the film, while t Series and kriarj have invested Rs 15 crore each
 abhishek ko 16 maheene pehle 'kedarnath' puri kerani thi, lekin ye abhi tak nahin hui
 Abhishek Kapoor has also had a dispute with Farhan Akhtar, Anushka Sharma, Rekha
 anban ke baad diarector abhishek kapur ne production house (kriarj antertenment or tii-siries) se naata tod liya he
 Now, kriarj Entertainment has issued a statement on this whole issue
 is actor ke haathon main haath daale ghoomte dikhin sara ali khanikhriarge antertenment ne kaha he ki hamaari company ke khilaaf abhishek kapur ke production house GITS (a guy in the sky pictures) dwaara failaai gai jaankariyaan galat or bebuniyadi hai
 GITS has not done its work properly
 film ke production main kaaphi deree kii gai
 The film has suffered from the very beginning due to GITS
 aage likhaa gaya he ki, kriarj antertenment ne in sabhi laaparvaahee ke baad bhi GITS ko bina shart samarthan diya
 Also continued to invest heavily in the film
 lekin baad main maaloom padaa ki die gaye amount kaa istemaal sahi tareeke se nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 We tried to resolve the dispute several times by talking with GITS but we were unsuccessful
 kriarj, tii-siries or balaji is film ke aadhikarik maalik he
 Hence, co-producers and GITS have no right to remove kriarj from the film
 ham apane ritis ke liye agle hafte bombai hoicourt jaaenge
 We hope that the Honorable Court will do justice to us

 The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) has decided to boycott the communal debates on news channels
 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh or saansad upendra kushvaha ne kaha, 'samachar channel arees or bhaajapa kaa agenda chalaa rahe hai or desh ke liye yah gambhir khatra he
 Fazal Imam Mallik, the party's national general secretary and spokesman, told NDTV that Kushwaha has written to like-minded parties, including the Congress president, that they too should not send their spokespersons to participate in such debates
 mallik ne bataaya ki upendra kushvaha ne rahul gandhi ke alaava rajd netaa tejasvi yadav, ham pramukh jeethanram maanjhi, viipi party pramukh mukesh saahani, sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav, basapa pramukh mayawati, bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri en chandrababu naidu, rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar, loktantric janata dal ke sharad yadav, neshnal conference ke faruk abdulla, jedies ke echdi devegoda ko patr likhaa he
 In the letter, Upendra Kushwaha wrote that 'the role of news channels is constantly in question for the last few years and especially for a few months
 samachar channelon main jis tarah kii bahasein ho raheen hai or ankaron kaa ravaiya vipakshi dalon ke saath jis tarah kaa rahata he vah channelon kii vishwasaneeyata par to sawaal uthaata hi he, channelon kii bhoomika bhi isse sandigdh dikhne lagati he
 It seems that the news channels are taking forward the agenda of RSS and BJP
 yah desh ke saamne gambhir sawaal he
 The channels have deviated from the core issues and are spreading their frenzy by raising issues like temple-mosque, patriot-sedition and hindu-muslim
 vipakshi dalon ko is khel main uljhane kii lagaataar koshish kii ja rahi he
 We should avoid it
 maanjhi bole- kushvaha se kam nahin chahie siten, nahin maane to karenge duusare vikalp par vichaarrashtriya lok samta party saamaajik nyaay kii pakshdhar he
 It is also a very sensitive subject for opposition parties
 hamaara lakshya raajnneetik manchon par samaaj ke dabe-kuchle
 The voice of the backward, the backward, the dalit-mahadalit, the stalwart, the tribal and the deprived, has to be raised vigorously
 ham rojgaar, yuvaaon, kisaanon or samjaki muddon ko lekar lagaataar sangharsh karte rahe hai
 But instead of these issues, the channel and BJP and RSS are constantly trying to indulge in pseudo nationalism and hindu-muslim debates
 hamen inase saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 Therefore, we humbly request you to boycott TV debates on these issues
 hamen in muddon par baatcheet ke liye apane pravaktaaon ko bhejne se parhez karnaa chahie
 The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party has decided that they will stay away from the debate on these issues
 saamaajik or raajnneetik muddon par hone vaali bahason main party jarur hissaa legi
 i hope that you will consider this issue seriously and keep yourself away from debates on hateful topics happening on TV channels
 deshhit ke liye aisa karnaa jaruri he

 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram said that all the passengers of the train are safe

 The CRPF and state police arrived and secured the train after being held hostage for several hours by militants of the People's Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA)
 railgadee kareeb dhai baje dopaher main roki gai thi jabaki iske paanch ghante baad ise chhudaaya ja sakaa
 Home Minister p Chidambaram, who is monitoring the situation in Kharijanai Delhi, demanded Maoists, "the train is safe and passengers are also safe
" ’’ unhone kaha ki ghatnasthal par kisi vipareet paristhiti ke sanket nahin hai
 The train left Bhubaneswar at nine in the morning
 pisipie kii maangon main jail main band apane netaa chhatradhar mahato kii rihaai bhi thi jise pashchim bengal ke mukhyamantri buddhadev bhattacharya ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 The demands were also written on the coaches of the train

 He said that there was also some firing at a place some distance away from the spot in which a civilian driver was injured
 kareeb 400 kii sankhya main aae ugravadiyon ne jhaadgram stesan se 10 kilometre dur bansatla main rail patariyon par vrikshon kii tahaniyaan daalkar railgadee ko roak diya or donon chaalkon ko railgadee se utar jane kaa aadesh diya
 Initial reports suggested both drivers were kidnapped

 Witnesses said that the militants did not harm the passengers and there were many red flags near the tracks

 Shortly before the crisis ended, Bhattacharya rejected the Maoists' demand for the release of Mahato and his arrested leaders and the removal of security forces
 maangen railgadee kii bogiyon par bhi likhi hui thim
 The PCPA, the organization that led the whole incident, also wanted to hold talks with Mamata Banerjee, who insisted that the militants leave the train first and ensure that passengers were safe
 banerjee ne kaha, ‘‘agar koi mujhase baat karnaa chahta he to vah samay le kar hamase baat kar saktaa he

 Any hostel is in itself a whole world where people come from every religion, culture and region
 yahaan har aadaton vaale log maujuud hote hai, aap unhen pasand karen yaa naapsand yah aapke upar he
 And if you talk about Boys Hostel, if any outsider stays here even for a day, then he will be shocked to know in which world he has come
 hostel ke kamare se lekar mess tak kaa maahaul aisa rahata he jisaki kalpana hostel ke baahar nahin kii ja sakati he
 Every type of creature lives here
 koi he ki sota rahata he to koi bhar raat jagaa rahata he
 If someone is calm, someone's voice keeps echoing in the hostel
 yahaan ham aapako hostel ke kuch aise hi kairactors ke bare main bataane vaale hai
 
 
 1
 hameshaa khoe se rahane vaala:pataa nahin is tip ke log kis grah par vicharan karte rahete hai
 Whenever you look at them, it seems that they have lost something and they are trying to find it
 2
 Religious: These are people who do not forget to remember God on everything before giving exams, before coming results, before going anywhere, before presenting the paper
 inke aas-paas ke kamaron main rahane vaale student parv-tyohaar par puja karne ke liye inase phool, agarbatti maang kar le jate hai
 Whatever the trouble is, they leave it to the uplifting
 3
 Brother / Dada: These are people who are ready to help everyone
 masti karte samay inhen koi puche na puche lekin musiibat ke samay sab inhen ko yaad karte hai
 4
 feku number van:koi bhi mauka ho ye jhooth bolnaa nahin chhodte hai
 Before their pole opens, they prepare a new story
 hostelmen juthi baton ko failaane kaa theka bhi inhen ke paas hota he
 5
 game khilne main mashgool:aap inke kamare main jaaen yaa mess main saath khaanaa khaaen, inkaa puraa dhyaan game par hota he or yah hameshaa apana hirecord todneor level paar karne ke chakkar main hote hai
 6
 phone par vyast rahane vaale:inkaa rummet hameshaa inase pareshaan rahata he, ye der raat tak phone par lage rahete hai
 When they understand the problem of roommate, they are found either in the corridor or on the stairs of the hostel
 7
 Reader Number One: The time of examination for them is always close, they neither meet in any party nor go to visit somewhere
 inhen aisi koi bhi activity main hissaa lenaa fijul main samay barbaad karnaa lagata he
 But what to do, despite all efforts, they are not able to top the college
 8
 There should just be a chance, the party arranges will do it themselves: Such boys of the hostel are just delayed to know that the student's birthday is on this date
 paise ke intjaam se lekar kamare sajaane tak kaa kaam ye khud kar lete hai
 Not only this, they are also adept at forcibly taking a party from someone
 9
 Leader Type: As soon as you enter the hostel, you will know who is the leader here, from their attire to their room, it is a testimony that they are leaders of the college
 agar netaa vaicharik rup se kamjor he or paise vaala he to inke aas-paas hameshaa chelon kii bheed jamaa rahati he
 10
 meri aawaaj hi pahchaan he:hostel ke kisi bhi kone main ye rahen lekin inaki aawaaj har taraf aati rahati he
 They never talk calmly
 bahes ho yaa hasi-majaak inhen chillane kii buree beemaari hoti he
 If courageous governments take big decisions, they should not hesitate to tell them the outcome of the decisions
 notebandi ne rojgaar se lekar kaarobaar tak sabakaa bajet bigaad diya to isse sarkaar ko bharpoor tex yaa phir rigerv bank se motaa labhaansh jarur milane vaala hoga! lekin bajet bhi guzar gaya alabatta notebandi ke phaayde-nuksaan ko lekar na to sarkaar kaa bol phuta, na hi rigerv bank ne aankade bataane kii jahamat uthaai
 Despite all efforts to make note ban, the budget and economic review bring out some facts related to demonetisation
 agar unhen ek sutara main baandha jaae to hamen ehsaas ho jayega ki notebandi par bekhudi besabab nahin he, kuch to he jisaki pardadari he
 Arrow! There is a saying that cannot be measured, it is impossible to handle
 vitt mantri kah chuke hai ki nakad kaale dhan kaa koi thos akalan uplabdh nahin he
 So on what basis was such a big decision to close 500 and 1000 notes and declare 86 per cent cash outright illegal? Economic review assumes that the currency rate of currency notes (rate of currency getting soiled and mutilated) Was the basis of the verdict
 soyal rate noton ke istemaal kii jaankaree detaa he
 According to Reserve Bank data, Rs 500
 se neeche ke mulya vaale note main soyal rate 33 fisadi salanaa he yani 33 fisadi gande kate-fate note har saal badal jate hai
 500 Rs
 ke note main soyal rate 22 or 1000 ru
 k note has 11 per cent
 samiksha ne duniya ke anya deshon main soyal rate ko bharat main bade noton ke prachlan par lagu karte hue nishkarsh nikaala he ki notebandi se pehle kareeb 3 lakh karod ru
 There were big notes of which were not fully used in transactions
 is raashi ko kya kaali nakadi mana ja saktaa he jo jidipi ke do fisadi ke baraabar he?is sawaal par samiksha maun he alabatta vah nakadi ke do aayam bataati he
 White money: Cash paid to employees after deducting tax and declaration of tax or money kept in contingencies in homes
 kaala dhanuachoti companiyaan yaa vyapaaree nakad main dhan rakhte hai or chunaav main chanda dete hai
 Target: Budget figures do not provide evidence of sitting on the note ban
 tex ke aankadon main ekamusth koi bahut badi rakam milane kaa akalan nahin he, alabatta aankade itnaa jarur bataate hai ki iskar sangrah main badhat kii dar tej rahegi
 Advance tax payments have increased by about 35 per cent since demonetisation
 agle saal iskar sangrah main lagbhag 25 fisadi kii badhat kii ummid he
 If the assessment is correct, then about 1 in two years
 5 lakh karod ru
 Additional income tax of Rs
 rigerv bank ne nahin bataaya he ki bade noton main kitna dhan banking system se baahar rah gaya he isliye rigerv bank se motaa labhaansh milane kaa akalan uplabdh nahin
 Despite suffering a "no slowdown due to loss", the government has accepted that the growth train has derailed
 aarthik samiksha bataati he ki notebandi ke chalate is saal aarthik vikaas dar main kareeb ek fisadi (pichley saal 7
 6) will decline
 agle saal bhi vikaas dar saat fisadi se neeche rahegi
 Demonetisation has led to loss of employment, loss of income in agriculture and large losses in the unorganized sector based on cash, but its figures are not available with the government
 sarkaar maan rahi he ki nakadi kaa pravaah saamaanya hone ke baad bainkon se jamaa teji se baahar niklegi, notebandi se sarkaar-rigerv bank kii saakh ko dhakka laga he or logon main bhavishya ke prati asamanjas badha he
 Accountability was a monetary decision, so profit and loss would have to be measured in figures
 bajet or samiksha ko khangaalane par hamen iske sirf do thos aankade milte hai
 In the four months of this year after the beneficial demonetisation and about 1 in the income tax collections during the next year
 5 lakh karod ru
 Can be increased
 nuksaan2016-17 main notebandi se jidipi main ek fisadi kii kami aegi jo ki 1
 5 lakh crore Rs
 ke aasapaas he
 For the Reserve Bank, the cost of printing of notes and the interest on bonds issued to balance cash flow in the market will also be added
 agar paroksh nuksaan ko ginati main na liya jaae to bhi iskar rajasav main badhotaree kaa anumaan jidipi ke nuksaan ke bilkul baraabar he
 The rest you yourself are sensible

 If i like a girl, maybe i will settle with her
 varanaa to sab bekaar he, pehle pyaar karo, phir dil tuutegaa, phir avsaad main jeeyo

 " Another airline of the country is on the verge of closure
 vijay maalya kii shandaar airlines kingfisher ko log abhi bhuule bhi nahin the ki ab maaran parivaar kii airlines dhan ke abhaav main ladkadaati dikh rahi he
 He could not have a single flight on Wednesday morning
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki vimaanon ko eendhan supplai karne vaali companiyon ne apane haath khadey kar die
 He says that spicejet owes him a lot and now lending will not be possible
 buudhvaar kii ghatana ke baad ab is nijee airlines ke bhavishya ke bare main chintaa honi zaahir he
 One of the specialties of this airline has been that it gave the common Indian a chance to board the aircraft and gave a direction to the aviation industry
 lekin aaj ise sahare kii jarurat he
 Its financial health has been eroded due to continuous losses
 isane kharch main katautee karne ke liye lij par liye vimaan bhi lautaa die or kai rooton par udaanen bhi radd kar deen
 Still its condition is not improving
 ab ise puri tarah se chalaane ke liye kam se kam 1500 karod rupee chahie
 This amount is so large that the Maran brothers cannot invest on their behalf
 abhi to ve airsel-maxim ke kanoonee vivaad or sibiai ke pachade main fanse huai hai
 Their industrial empire is faltering and in such a situation it will not be possible to raise such huge amount immediately
 sarkaar prayaas kar rahi he ki use kuch lone mil jaae taaki vah apana kaamkaaj sucharu rup se chalaa saken
 spicejet is not a small airline, it flies to 46 cities in India and abroad
 isamen 20,000 log sidhe yaa paroksh rup se kaam karte hai
 What will happen to their families after the shutdown of this airlines will also have to be thought about
 sirf yah kah dene se ki yah airlines karj nahin chukaa paa rahi he, us par karrwai karnaa galat hoga
 Everyone knows how many families have fallen when Kingfisher drowned
 lekin yah samasya kyon khadi hui, is par bhi ek nazar daalana uchit hoga
 The government allowed private airlines to fly but did not formulate a proper aviation policy
 jet eendhan ke daam itane zyada the ki airlinon kii qamar patali ho gai
 States have more than 20% VAT on it
 yah sarkari lut he
 Imposing VAT in this way is utterly wrong
 rajya sarkarein rajasav kamaane ke liye raste to dhundhati nahin hai so ve petrol-dijal par manamaane dhang se tex lagaati hai
 The second case is the new airport, where airlines are paying a lot of fares
 karmchaariyon kaa vetan badhata ja rahaa he or anya tarah ke kharch bhi bad gaye hai
 In such a situation, how can she put herself in a profitable position? There are many obstacles in the way of foreign investment and getting money from there is not an easy task
 baharhaal spicejet ko bachaae rakhana behad jaruri he or iske liye iske pramotaron ko aage badhkar nivesh karnaa hi hoga
 They cannot depend on the loan of banks
 udhar sarkaar ko chahie ki vah ek samuchit or vistrut videsh niti banaae or jet eendhan par lagaae gaye baari bharkam waite ko kam karen
 This industry is important for the country and it has immense potential for employment

 This time in the Kapoor family, the echo of 'ganpati Bappa Morya' will not be heard
 kapur khandaan har saal bahut hi dhoomdhaam ke saath ganesh utsav (ganesh Chaturthi 2019) manaaya karata tha
 But this time this echo will not be heard
 kapur khandaan har saal aarake studio main ganesh utsav kaa aayojan karata tha, jise bahut hi bhavyata ke saath anjaam diya jaataa tha
 But after the sale of RK Studio, Ganpati's Dhoom will no longer resonate in RK Studio
 lekin aarake studio main bhayankar aag ke baad hue nuksaan ke baad ise bech diya gaya tha
 Randhir Kapoor has said about Ganesh Utsav that my father Raj Kapoor started celebrating Ganapati at RK Studios, and now he does not have such a big property on which he can organize Ganesh Utsav in the same way
 ganesh chaturthi (ganesh Chaturthi 2019) ke celibrasion ko lekar randhir kapur ne 'times of india' se kaha, 'vah hamaare liye aakhri ganesh chaturthi celibrasion tha
 RK Studio did not live
 
 
 to kahaan karenge? papa ne 70 saal pehle yah parampara shuru kii thi or vah ganesh ko bahut pyaar bhi karte the, ab hamaare paas jagah hi nahin he to ham aarake studio jaisi celibrasion kahaan karenge
 We love Bappa very much and we also have reverence in him, but i think we cannot continue this tradition
 'aarake studio (RK Studio) main ganesh chaturthi celibrasion ganesh chaturthi (ganesh Chaturthi 2019) or holi kaa jashn bahut hi dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa rahaa he
 It has also been famous all over the country
 lekin samay ke saath chijen badali hai, or ab holi ke baad ganesh chaturthi bhi nahin hogi
 During Ganesh Chaturthi, pandals were held in RK studios, and there was a crowd of people all day
 ganesh chaturthi ke aakhri din bappa ko bahut dhoomdhaam ke saath visarjeet kiya jaataa tha

 pashchimi africa main ibola ke prakope se das lakh se zyada logon ko prabhavit bataate hue vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne chetavanee di he ki is swasthya sankat kaa ‘koi jaldi ant’ hota najar nahin aa rahaa or iske prasar ko rokane ke liye ‘vishesh upaay’ apnaane ke liye kaha he
 According to the latest information released from the World Health Organization, between 10 August and 11 August, 128 new cases of Ebola virus have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, while 56 deaths have occurred
 is tarah virus se prabhavit kul maamalon kii sankhya badhkar 1,975 or mauton kii sankhya 1,069 ho gai he
 WHO Director General Margaret Chan said that more than one million people are affected by the disease and they need to cooperate to meet their daily needs including food
 chaan ne geneva main bataaya, is prakope kaa koi jald ant hota najar nahin aa rahaa
 This is an extraordinary outbreak, which requires extraordinary measures
 yah ek jabardast swasthya sankat he or yadi iske sanchaar ko rokane ke liye or adhik prayaas nahin kiye gaye to yah ek maanviya sankat kaa rup le saktaa he
 Even if you are wearing a very nice dress, but if you are not of inner-wear size and you are not comfortable in them, then your best dress will also look useless
 aise main ye bahut jaruri ho jaataa he ki aapaki bra kaa sies aapke figure ke anuroop hi ho
 Usually girls think that wearing a small cup size bra will keep the breasts tight for a long time
 iske alaava unhen lagata he ki dinabhar bra pahananaa, acchhee figure ke liye jaruri he
 But you will be surprised to know that both these things are completely wrong
 shaayad aapako pataa na ho lekincoubis ghante bra pahananaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Have you ever thought about how it affects your health? 
 
 choubis ghante bra pahanane se twachaa saans hi nahin le paati he or isse kai tarah kii swasthya samasyaayein paidaa ho jaati hai
 Try to remove your bra after coming from office or outside
 aap khud hi raahat mahasoos karengi
 Wearing a bra throughout the day also causes skin scars
 dinabhar bra pahane rahane ke ye 6 said-effect aapako bhi daraa denge:1
 Breast Pen Women who wear bra all day often complain of breast pain
 khaastaur par un mahilaon ko jo sahi sies kii bra nahin pehnateen
 2
 blad cirkulation hota he prabhavitchobis ghante bra pahane rahane sebled cirkulation bhi prabhavit hota he
 Sometimes there is a risk of damage to the breast tissue due to too much bra being tight
 3
 Back pain If you have frequent back pain, your bra may be the reason
 agar aap choubis ghante bra pahane rahati hai to aapako peeth dard kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 Especially for women who wear small size and very tight bras
 4
 Skin Irritation Wearing a bra for 24 hours may cause you to have skin irritation
 kabhi khujali, kabhi jalan, kabhi asahaj hona iske lakshan hai
 5
 hyperpigmentationachobis ghante bra pahanane vaali mahilaon ko hyperpigmentation kii samasya hone kaa khatra rahata he
 6
 fungus ke failane kii aanshkabra pahanane rahane se har samay moishchar bana rahata he
 In such a situation, the possibility of spreading fungus also increases
 tejatarraar maane jane vaale special jaj o pi saini ne tu-ji cese main 1550 pej kaa jajment bade sadhe andaaj main or sooyeeboojh ke saath likhaa he
 It would be a big challenge for the investigating agencies ie prosecution CBI and ED to challenge it
 kyonki jaj opi saini ne saaf shabdon main bina lagalpet ke sibiai or idi ke saath doorsanchaar vibhaag ke baabuon ke saamaanya gyaan, takneekee gyaan or kanoonee gyaan sabaki pole khol kar rakh di
 The court said that there is no record and no evidence from the prosecution that proves the guilt of the accused
 phir chaahe wo cat of date ke fiks karne kii baat ho, yaa 'pehle aao, pehle paao' niti ke manupulation kaa maamla ho, yaa ki companiyon ko spectrum dene main herapheri kii baat ho yaa kalainger tivi ko 200 karod rupee rishwat ke taur par dene kaa aarope ho
 Justice Saini has also said that the charge sheet of this case is like misreading of the official record, selective reading of its meaning and going beyond the context
 faisle ke mutabik jaanch agenciyon ke ye aarope patr jaanch ke dauraan gavaahon kii taraf se di hui maukhik gavaahi par aadhaarit hai
 Because the witnesses never said these things during the testimony in the court
 bataa den ki agar gavaahon ne maukhik taur par bayaan die he or oficial record ke khilaaf jate he to use kanoon main manyata nahin he
 The judgment also says that many of the facts recorded in the charge sheet are wrong, such as the recommendation of revision of entry fees by the Finance Secretary and the recommendation of TRAI for revision of entry fee
 2ji faisle main court ne kaha ki nateeja yahi he or mujhe ye kehane main ye bilkul bhi sankoch nahin he ki aropiyon ke khilaaf cese ko sabit karne main abhiyojan paksh buree tarah se naakaam rahaa
 The court held that the charge sheet is weld choreographed
 court ne adhikariyon ke naakaarepan ko rekhaankit karte hue kaha ki aropiyon ke khilaaf daleelon ko sabit karne vaale pukhta saboot nahin hai
 The prudence of the telecom department officials in understanding the legal and technical terminology is under question
 jaj ne kaha ki unako kai rosemara main istemaal honevaali chizon ke arth tak maaloom nahin the, jirah ke dauraan bhi kai dfa to abhiyojan paksh ye hi tay nahin kar paaya ki wo aakhir sabit kya karnaa chahta he?cat of dats, first kam first sarv theory jaise kai muddon par aropiyon ke khilaaf kisi aapraadhik saazish kaa saboot abhiyojan paksh court main record par nahin de paaya
 The prosecution's argument did not show any synergy between the statements of the witnesses and the evidence presented
 lihaaja adaalat ne sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have been the target of critics after the defeat in the Test series against England but former captain Kapil Dev said that in limited-overs cricket, India has no better captain than them
 kapil ne kaha, ‘test maichon main dhoni kii captaini par aapako jo kahana he kahiye lekin tii20 or vanade main usase behatar koi captain nahin he
 We won the World Cup last year under his leadership and you cannot change it just because he is having a bad time after that
 mere lihaaj se vah ab bhi sarvshereshth captain or khilaadi he
 Another former captain Mohammad Azharuddin, however, said that Dhoni should not captain all formats
 ajaharuddin ne bharat-pakistan shrinkhalaa se pehle ‘aaj tak’ par panel charchaa ke dauraan kaha, ‘jab team acha pradarshan karti he to dhoni acha captain lagata he lekin jab team harati he to vah bhram kii sthiti main lagata he or uske paas koi ranneeti nahin hoti he
 The selectors and the board need to decide soon
 meraa maananaa he ki alag praaroop ke liye alag captain hona chahie

 We? Is it clear when i say this? Are we, the people of India, so united that i am collectively entitled to say 'we'? Doesn't 'we' just feel like me and people like me? For this 'hum', Independence Day is just an annual celebration, a day off
 ham subah jaagate hai, apana fasebuk states badalte hai, twit karte hai, laal kile se pradhanmantri kaa upadesh sunate hai, tivi par ben kingsle ko mahatma gandhi kii bhoomika nibhaate dekhte hai or duusari subah waapas apane kaam main masaroof ho jate hai
 How dramatic is all this? We have been doing this for a long time only on August 15
 jin logon ko is raashtra se phayda hua, ve garv mahasoos karte hai
 It is very easy
 safal hone par ham yah maanate hai ki sab hamaari mehnat or pratibha kaa nateeja he
 While celebrating the celebration of the nation, we pat ourselves on the back and celebrate
 main usee atmamugdh, aatmakendrit or buniyadi rup se apana hit chaahane vaale varg kaa hissaa hum
 After all, what does it mean to be free and independent? Freedom is a collective feeling
 yah duusare logon ke bare main he, mere bare main nahin
 There is compassion in it, not grace
 hamaare swatantraaa senaniyon ne apane saamaajik rutabe kaa kchayaal kiye bagaiyr garibon kii durdasha se baichaiyn hokar ladaai shuru kii thi or ekajute hokar hamaare liye aazaadee kii maang buland kii
 But we have lost the ability to see, feel and hear
 or un sattarudh firangiyon kii jagah aaj hamaare swadeshi dabang virajman hai
 Today whenever 'we' mention the poor, oppressed and marginalized people, there is no compassion but compassion behind it
 main unki nekaniyat par sawaal nahin uthaa rahaa, lekin isse garibon ke sarokaaron se judi baton ko nazarandaaj karne main hamen suvidha milti he
 We have to think and believe that we have got these privileges due to the heritage that has been going on for centuries and caste superiority is part of our way of life
 hamen un sari chizon par 'unke' adhikaar ko maananaa hoga, jinase hamane pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se ab tak unhen vanchit rakhaa
 We cannot be satisfied thinking that we can purify ourselves from caste prejudice by teaching a child who works at home or by giving them a job in his company
 isse hamaare paap nahin dhulenge
 Unfortunately, today the caste has changed its dress and we think we can get rid of it by naming it as 'class'
 yah ek saral lekin khatarnaak daleel he
 Of course, there is still a long way to go for significant change in society
 phir bhi, aaj jati sambandhi charchaa main khulaapan dikhne laga he
 But we still have a self-centered sense of lying to ourselves that needs to be overcome with the same strength — the first division is on the social scale, between gender disparity and female dislike
 stri—purush asamanta ke jariye nasli, jatigat or dharmik vibhaajan hota he
 All these things have been cleverly maintained by the male dominated ideology, therefore, the role of any major change in the society will be prepared on the basis of gender equality and it will have to break the boundaries of words and enter into practice

 How many Dalit cricketers do you know? Cricket is a game of gentlemen, but is it also a game of upper castes? It explores in detail the new book 'foreign Sports at its Ground' by historian and author Ramachandra Guha
 diggaj lekhak ne is kitaab main cricket kaa samajashastreey vishleshan karne kii koshish kii he
 In this book published by 'penguin', he has tried to assess the impact of race, religion, caste and nationalism in Indian cricket
 saath hi bhartiya cricket itihaas ke gumnaam cricketron ke bare main vistaar se baat kii he
 His interview in connection with this book is pesh-e-nazar
 sawaal: penguin hindi se prakashit apni kitaab 'videshi khel apane maidan par' main aapane is par baat kii he kaise vibhaajan ke daur main cricket kaa khel isse prabhavit hua tha
 What was the major impact of the partition of India and Pakistan on the cricket of the subcontinent? What place would an integrated cricket team have in world cricket? Do you see any possibility of a unified team with different existence of countries in the future? Answer: If India had not split then perhaps we would have become the most powerful cricket team in the world
 aap sattar ke dashak ko lijie
 India's batting line-up consists of Gavaskar and Miandad, Vishwanath and Zaheer
 imran khan or sarfaraj nawaz openar hote or gendbaazi bedi se shuru hoti phir chandrashekhar aate
 Sad that it was fantasy and will remain fantasy
 bharat-pakistan kii kabhi bhi ekikrut team banane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Just you can hope and wish that cricket matches played between the two countries should not be played with extreme bitterness
 sawaal: aap ipel ke aalochak rahe hai
 How is it hurting the game? How did it become such an important sport and do you think it has caused huge damage to the old style Test matches? How did IPL become such a big phenomenon? Answer: My opposition to IPL is cricket, social and moral
 20-20 match asal cricket nahin he
 The boundary is ridiculously small (so that sixes can easily be studded)
 ballebaaj apane saare stroke nahin khel pate or keval aade balle vaale or gend hawa main oochhaalane vaale shots khelte hai
 And yes, bowlers have little chance to show their skill in taking wickets
 saamaajik str par ipel ne shahar or gaanv ke bich gahari khai paidaa kii he, aarthik rup se zyaada or kam viksit kshetron ke bich kii duuri badhaai he or saath hi peshewar or mazdoor varg ke bich duuri badhaai he
 Why is it that Maharashtra has two IPL teams and Uttar Pradesh does not have one
 jab bharat, bharat banakar kheltaa he to sabhi naagarik iskaa anand le pate hai or is khel kii uttejnaa ko mahasoos kar sakate hai
 But the IPL matches are mostly upper class watchers
 aakhir main, yah baat hairaan karne vaali he ki zyaadaatar pragatisheel or nai soch rakhane vaali bhartiya companiyon ne koi ipel team nahin rakhi he
 Tata, Mahindra and other such companies have stayed away from it
 duusari taraf, rajanetaaon se kareebi rishton se phayda uthaane vaale badnaam udyogpatiyon tathaa apane karmchaariyon ko vetan nahin dene vaale udyogpatiyon ne ipel tiimon ko badhaava diya he
 In my view, the IPL exposes the worst aspects of cricket as well as Indian society
 sawaal: jaisaa ki aapaki kitaab ke jariye janaa ja saktaa he ki cricket ne tab chal rahe rashtriya swadhinata andolan ko apni tarah se majbootee pradaan kii thi
 Can the same thing be said about cricket in the era of nation building? And today as the nation is moving fast towards a new phase, what role do you see cricket in it? Can there be any such hope from cricket? Answer: When India was a colony, and even in the first few decades of its independence, cricket played a role as an instrument of nationalist aspirations
 isiilie 1926-27 main ek emsisi team ke khilaaf sike naidu ke shatak (jisamen 11 chakke shaamil the) ne aisi vyapak prashansa ko janm diya tha or 1971 main hamaari vijay ke baad pradhanmantri cricketron se mili thim
 Once again, in the 1990s, during the Kargil War and the decade of rebellion in Kashmir, matches between India and Pakistan held political meaning
 lekin ab ise dekhte hue ki ab ham kareeb saat dashak puraane raashtra hai, hamen kam andharashtravaadi hona chahie or ise mahaj ek khel ke rup main hi dekhnaa chahie
 If we lose a match or series from Australia or even to Pakistan, it should not affect our national values at all
 sawaal: aap paryaavaran or raajnneetik itihaas par likhte rahe hai
 How did you come up with the idea of writing a book on the history of cricket in India? Answer: It was almost a coincidence
 maine bombai panchakoniya pratiyogita (jo pehle chatushkoniyathi) par ek kitaab likhane kii yojana banaai thi
 This was our major cricket competition between 1912 and 1945
 tab yah ranjai trophy se bhi adhik mahatvapurn thi
 The first great Indian Test cricketers C
K
 naidu, vijay marchent, mushtak ali, mohammad nisaar, amar singh, vijay hajaare, vinu mankad ne isamen apni nishaniyaan chodi thim
 The purpose of my book was to have a cricketer history, focusing on innings and losses and matches won
 lekin main jitna adhik shodh karata gaya, utana hi maine dekha ki chatushkoniya tathaa panchakoniya raajnneeti or samaaj ke saath aapas main gunthe hue the
 So finally i wrote a book in which race, religion, caste and nationalism were as important as cricket itself
 sawaal: dalit gendbaaj paalvankar baaluu ke bare main pehali baar itani saamagree uplabdh hui he
 What was the idea behind placing sand in the center of the book? Answer: It emerged from within, during research
 mumbai main, main baaluu ke bhattije se mila, jinhone anmol paariwarik dastavej mujhe saunpe (jisamen marathi main chapa ek sansmaran bhi shaamil tha) or apane chachaa tathaa apane pita vitthal (baaluu ke chote bhai or ek pratibhashali ballebaaj) kii yaaden mere saath bantee
 Then, while watching the micro-films of a leading nationalist newspaper Bombay Chronicle, i found interesting material on the personal struggles of the two brothers
 ye donon bhai apane samay ke behtareen hindu cricketer the, lekin dalit prishthbhumi se hone ke kaaran unhen paryaapt sweekruti se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 The Bombay Chronicle itself led the movement honoring Baloo and Vitthal
 iske baad maine biaar ambedkar ke saath baaluu ke kareebi or jatil sambandh ke bare main nai or ab tak andekhi reportein bhi pain
 In this way, Balu finally became the central theme of this book and i think they are totally worth it
 kyonki ve ek shandaar cricketer the or saath hi saath ek ullekhneey insaan bhi the
 Arguably he was the first player from India to become a symbol and he was also the most important Dalit figure in Western India between 1910 and 1930
 sawaal: aapaki kitaab kaa bada hissaa cricket main vanchit tabakon ke sangharsh ko lekar he
 Nearly a century after such first attempts, where does Indian cricket stand today in the case of Dalits? How inclusive has it been? Answer: After Balu and his brothers, some of the best cricketers came from the disadvantaged sections
 1947 ke baad shaayad teen yaa chaar daliton ne bharat ke liye test cricket khelaa, lekin koi bhi khyaati nahin hasil kar sakaa
 i am sure no tribal or North East have played for India till now
 isliye, jabaki bhartiya team main khel prashansakon main se sabhi virgon or dharmon ke log aate hai, lekin sheersh str par khilne vaale khilaadi vyapak rup se shaharon or oonchi jatiyon se aate hai
 The social and geographical diversity of the nation is not fully represented in the Indian cricket team
 sawaal: aapane ek khel ke itihaas ko raajnneetik or saamaajik itihaas kii sangati main pesh kiya he
 Have you ever felt that any history of sports can be written beyond political and social history? What would it be like if such a history were written? Answer: What i have written is the social and political history of Indian cricket, written through the 'prime categories' of race, caste, religion and nation
 nae sanskaran ke liye maine cricket par bazaar or kaarobaar ke asar par (jaisaa ki ipel main dikhataa he) ek puraa nayaa adhyay joda he
 However, it is possible to write a history that focuses its attention on the game itself, without taking social dimensions into account
 mujhe acha lagegaa agar koi baaluu or vitthal kii avadhi ke bitne ke baad khel par raaj karne valichaukadi kii ek jeevani likhe: sike naidu, vijay marchent, vijay hajaare or vinu mankad
 All of them were unmatched cricketers who received few opportunities on the international stage
 mere dimag main ek cricket adhyayan he, jo tab khel jaisaa hua karata tha, uske sandarbh main unki ballebaaji or gendbaaji kii style kaa vishleshan kare, jo maidan par unki mukhya uplabdhiyon kaa vishleshan kare aadi
 Naidu could wash the bowlers with mastery like Virender Sehwag
 marchent or hajaare, rahul dravid ke saanche ke shreshthatam ballebaaj the
 And Veenu Mankad was arguably the greatest all-rounder than Kapil Dev
 ye pratham mahaan bhartiya cricketer the or is mahanata kaa samuchit akalan abhi baaki he
 i hope that some young writer will take over this work
 jharkhand ke jamshedpur se darindagi kii had paar kar dene vaala maamla saamne saamne aayaa he

 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne sakht rukh apanaate hue kaha tha ki aam logon ke paas aisa yantra hona chahie, jo pataa laga sake ki radiation kaa str kya he? court ne kaha he ki mobile toweron se nikalne vaale radiation se pakshi gaayab ho rahe hai
 Or there should be a system, so that people know about radiation
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki radiation ko lekar logon ke man main jo dar he vah dur hona chahie
 What is the standard regarding government's radiation in the country as compared to abroad? Are there violations of rules regarding mobile tower radiation, action taken? The court had asked the Center to answer some questions whether a study was ever done about the radiation of the mobile tower as to how it affects people and birds
 Has the government set any limit for radiation? supreme court mobile toweron se hone vaali radiation ko lekar daakhil yachikaaon par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 On behalf of the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan has said in the Supreme Court that the parliamentary party had said that towers should be removed from places where the population is more, but the Center did nothing

 Is Pakistan buoyed by the action of Indian Army? kya bujdil he pakistan jo hamaare nagarikon ko nishaanaa bana rahaa he
 This question arises from the statement of Army Chief General Bipin Rawat

 He said, our preparations are complete to give a suitable answer to this action of Pakistan

 By doing this, Pakistan is creating panic among citizens
 army chif bipin ravat ke bayaan se yah to saaf he ki pakistan kobhartiya senouski har ek harakat kaa makul jawaab to de hi rahi he
 Also, if Pakistan takes any other way of thinking, then the Indian Army will continue to give a befitting reply to it

 'dekhen film 'ham tum dushmandushman' kaa trailor: Senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, while describing Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi as mere proclamation, said that he has left behind his predecessor Nitish Kumar in this matter
 unhone kaha ki aisi ghoshnaaon se ve janata ko dhokhaa de rahe hai
 Sushil Modi issued a press release on Sunday, saying that Manjhi has made more than a thousand announcements during his tenure of 250 days so far, while he has only 200 days left before the Bihar assembly elections to implement them
 
 susheel modi ne kaha ki maanjhi ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki anusuchit jatiyon janajatiyon ke logon ko theke main aarakshan milegaa or isi samaaj ke 43,000 logon ko gaanvon main 'safai mitra' ke rup main tainaat kiya jayega
 Besides, five villages of every block will be developed under Mukhyamantri Adarsh gram Yojana and girls of class VIII will also be given cycles
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ne gaya, purniya or bhagalpur main hoicourt kii peeth sthapit karne jaisi ghoshnaaen bhi kar daali hai, lekin inhen lagu karne main ve sakasham nahin hai
 Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Council Sushil Kumar Modi said that on January 20, Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi had signed a file for withdrawal of suspension of Patna Municipal Commissioner Kuldeep Narayan, but this order could not be implemented
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ne sabhi schuli chaatro ko chaatravrutti or cycle evam poshaak yojana kaa laabh dene ke liye 75 fisadi hajiri kii anivaaryta samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi, lekin vitt mantri or shiksha mantri ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Sushil alleged that despite seeing the fate of his orders and announcements, Manjhi is making Bihar a mockery of his own, not only by making quick announcements
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki pradesh ke har jile main saikadon jagah par pradarshan, todphod or aagjanee kii ghatnaayen ho rahi hai, bihar sulag rahaa he, lekin sattarudh dal ke netaa khinchataan or bhoj kii raajnneeti main mashgool hai
 Sushil Modi said that his party is committed to giving the state a capable government by rescuing the state from this odd situation with the target of its mission '185 Plus' in the Bihar assembly elections

 This country is secular, but just as no mosque can be built in the Vatican, or a church in Mecca, in Ayodhya, nothing can be built other than a temple
 "uma bharti ne kaha ki 'ham supreme court par koi sawaal khadaa nahin kar sakate kyonki vah hamaare liye bhagwaan kaa mandir he
 But i have a right and no one can challenge that right, that is that Ramlala is sitting there, she is being worshiped and a grand temple will be built there

 This happened in the eighties

 He was a ripe teenager
 uski aawaaj baari hone lagi thi, par abhi aadmi kii aawaaj nahin hui thi
 That is why the other man (of course he was the man, even the good man) whom he accidentally joined at the other end of the line joined him, a breathtaking little heavy and yet strangely innocent woman
 Understood
 us ladke par bhi vikruti kii koi lajij khabt savaar thi or usne us aadmi ko sahi baat nahin bataai
 They just kept talking to each other
 vah unke hakeekat main aamane-saamne kabhi mili bagaiyr khalis phone par lambey vakt tak kaayam rahaa jununee or kaamuk romance tha, jo kareeb 10 saal chalaa
 During that time the boy became a woman, named Ananya, for that man
 usne—yani aadmi—ne kaha ki use anitya kaha jaataa tha
 Anitya tells Ananya that she is a doctor around 35
 shaadishuda
 There is also a son
 ve kai saalon tak phone par antaheen baaten karte the, aksar dopaher ke vakt, kabhi-kabhi der raat ko, jinamein ve aapas main aisi baaten saajha karte jo yahaan likhane laayak nahin hai
 His talk used to be erotic
 donon uttejit ho jate
 The boy often brought himself and Anity to ejaculation
 phir ek din anitya ne ananyaa kaa number kisi duusare aadmi ko de diya, phir kisi tisare ko or phir kisi chauthe ko bhi
 What she would do with all this was not just "phone sex"
 kuch or bhi tha, kuch zyada, jisaki buniyaad mili-jule laad-pyaar, utsukata or majaburi par tiki thi
 They were eager to meet him, but Ananya stubbornly turned down such an offer
 jaldi hi ve uske mohpash main funs gaye or vah unke mohpash main funs gai
 During those ten years, the boy grew up, but he grew up to become such a creature which the world would not even say
 usne aadamiyon ke saath, yaa kahana chahie ki apane hi ling (gender) ke nahin bhi to apane hi ling (sex) ke duusare sadasyon ke saath, ''asal" rishte rakhana shuru kar diya
 He meets them at all kinds of places: trams, buses, parks, roads, toilets, parties, hotels, libraries, offices and homes
 technology bhi teji se badal rahi thi
 The eighties changed in the nineties and then their transformation became meaningless
 mobile aayaa
 Internet has also arrived
 donon ek ho gaye or ek nai smartnes ko janm diya
 With that, Ananya slowly and completely disappeared in the common light of virtual or virtual and her infinite possibilities
 utane hi dhire-dhire or swaabhaavik tareeke se ve duusare aadmi bhi gaayab ho gaye
 Also buried with him is his overbearing ardor, his strange conflagration of lust and trust, his unrestrained distraught craving, stories filled with glorious variations of his life filled with wives, children, mothers, fathers, neighbors and friends
 ananyaa in kahaniyon se utani hi mantrmugdh thi jitani vah phone par unke saath kiye gaye sex se thi
 She would even say that she was addicted to these stories more than sex
 nai sahasrabdi main kisi mukaam par ananyaa phir ek algebiticu kaaryakarta anand main badal gai
 She now had her own "identity", which was simultaneously raw and convincing, private and political, public and professional
 yah aisi pahchaan thi, jise vinamr or mumkin tisare nijee sarvnaam main badalanaa kaiyon ne mushkil paaya

 vah samalangik, vishamalangik aadamiyon, ubhayalingiyon or aise aadamiyon se bhi mil or sex kar chukaa tha, jinhen ratti bhar andaaj nahin tha ki stri, purush yaa ve koun yaa kya hote hai
 He did not even feel any desire to tell them
 kabhi-kabhi ye mulaakaaten itani aksarha huin ki dosti main badal gayi
 The sexuality remained in the friends, or they moved from sex to a kind of shuddering and excited ease and pleasure
 vah aksar apane shaadishuda doston (vishamalangik or samalangik) ko yah kahkar chedhta ki ek hi vyakti ke sang yon sambandh guda maithun se zyada aprakritik he
 He never wanted a "long-time companion"
 use yah lafj hi ubaau dhang se gaiyr-samalangik lagata tha
 Anand would sometimes feel sad to remember Ananya and those supernatural old days he had with her, then his disappearance would have seemed like the death of a homosexual who seemed to have disappeared from the world like a Cheshire Cat, gimmicky behind him
 Leaving nothing but what is called "gender" or gender discrimination
 use yah lafj pasand nahin tha
 He preferred "sex" or sex
 yah kam antiseptic tha
 In those twenties of the eighties or even in the early years of the Internet, the possibility that was open to him was the beginning of more basic ways of inventing himself

 Could it have been a thick enclosure of utter fantasy or imagination, which was not coined by anyone but the crazy, the lover and the poet? After all, was it not a prankster of Shakespeare who claimed long before this entire friction was invented, that the truest poem was the most hypocritical poem?

 maamle main madhepura ke mahila thana main praathmiki darj karwaai gai he, jabaki ladki ko medical jaanch ke liye aspataal bheja gaya he
 According to Pramila, in-charge of Mahila police station, the girl's health had suddenly worsened on July 1, after which the family called 55-year-old tantric Mahendra Mehta, who lives in the neighborhood, for treatment
 tantric ne ladki kii maa se kaha ki us par devi kaa prakope he or ladki ko ekant main le janaa padegaa
 The girl has warts in a tantric relationship, so the mother let the girl go with her
 bataaya jaataa he ki tantric jhaad-phoonk ke bahaane ladki ko bageeche main le gaya or vahaan uske saath rape kii ghatana ko anjaam diya
 On the other hand, the girl told that the next day of the incident when her mother was not at home, the tantric entered the house on the pretext of asking gram
 tantric usase ashleel baaten karne laga or shaam ko bageeche main aane ko kaha
 To teach the tantrik a lesson, the girl also went to the garden at eight o'clock at night and took a knife with her
 
 
 
 And according to the revenge taken from the tantric, as soon as he reached the garden, the tantrik once again started talking obscenely with him
 yahi nahin, usne phir se rape karne kii koshish kii, jiske baad mauka milte hi ladki ne chaaku se tantric ke ling par waar kar diya or vahaan se bhaag gai
 Meanwhile, Madhepura Superintendent of Police Anand Kumar Singh said that the panchayat was also sitting in the village over the matter and the villagers tried to crack the case
 lekin ladki shikaayat lekar purv jila parshad ke paas pahunchi or phir buudhvaar ko mahila thana main maamla darj karavaaya gaya
 Singh informed that orders have been given for the arrest of the accused, Tantrik will be arrested soon
