 There has been a voice from Bollywood in support of isolated comedian Kapil Sharma after his controversial tweet
 abhinayta navazuddin siddiki, arbaz khan ne kapil ke liye apni baat rakhi
 These actors were on the occasion of Eid ul Azha in Mumbai to promote their film 'freaky Ali'
 pichley hafte kapil sharma ke twit main unhone apane daphtar ko niyamit karne ke liye BMC ke logon se 5 lakh rupee ghoose maange jane kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 With this, Kapil, while mentioning his own Rs 15 crore income tax, tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked whether these are good days? is twit ke baad kapil sharma vivaad main funs gaye
 On one hand, there is pressure on them to disclose the names of bribe collectors

 On this occasion, actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui instructed not to give too much weight to the matter and said that the matter is very small

 chaatra kota main rahakar piemti kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 Last night she was found hanging in the hostel room
 maukey se koi suicide note bhi nahin mila he
 The case is related to Mahavir Nagar police station area of coaching City Kota
 jahaan bihar ke khagariyaa kii rahane vaali sneha suman ek hostel main rahakar piemti kii taiyaari kar rahi thi
 Last year, he took admission in a coaching institute in Kottake
 iske saath hi vah gyarahavin kaksha main pard rahi thi
 At five o'clock on Monday evening, she was seen by hostel staff and other girl students
 kareeb 6 baje ke baad usne kamare main jaakar pankhe se fanda lagaakar khudakushi kar lee
 At night, when she did not come out of the room to eat food, other students went to the room to call her
 lekin kamare kaa darwaja nahin khulaa
 On getting the information, the warden also reached the spot and knocked on the door, but no response came
 iske baad police ko soochna di gai
 The police reached the spot and broke the door and reached inside where the student was hanging on the noose
 police ne chaatra ke shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 Information has been given to the relatives of the deceased
 police ko chaanbin main pataa chalaa ki ravivaar ko chaatra kaa koching main test bhi tha
 Prima facie the police is considering the stress of studies as the cause of suicide
 jaanch adhikari kaluram kaa kahana he ki maukey se koi suicide note nahin mila he
 The girl students living with her are being questioned
 gharavaalon ne bataaya he ki uske upar koi dabaav nahin tha lekin bataaya ja rahaa he ki padhai kaa dabaav suicide kii ek vajah ho sakati he
 It is worth mentioning that many teams from the Human Rights Commission to the Ministry of Human Resources and the State Government have given their reports to prevent the incidents of suicide in Kota
 lekin chaatro ke aatmahatya karne kaa sissila thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 So far this year, 16 students have committed suicide in Kota

 ) ibi ke sutron ne ek chaunkaane vaale khulaasa karte hue kaha he ki aatankwaadi sanghathan indian mujahiddeen ne do saal ke andar 40 karod rupee jamaa kar liye hai
 These funds have been raised through donations, extortion and hawala
 is khulaase main sabase hairaan karanevaali baat ye he ki local str kaam karne vaale kai raajnneetik dalon ne bhi aatankwaadi sanghathan indian mujahidin ko paise die hai
 The IB has formed a joint team to investigate the entire matter and 37 suspects related to IM are being detained and questioned
 aisa mana ja rahaa he aatanki sanghathan iem ne itani badi rakam kii ugaahi hathiyaar kharidne, golabarood kaa intjaam karne or network kii takat badhaane ke liye kiya he
 When the Chiefs of Police met in Delhi, this information was submitted to the Home Minister
 puure khulaase main chaukaanewaali baat ek ye bhi he ki aatankwaadi sanghathan iem ko desh ke amuman har ilaake se fund mili hai, lekin goa, mumbai ke kuch hisse, karnataka, purvi upi, pashchim bengal ke kuch hisse or yahaan tak kii dilli main bhi iem ko fund mili hai
 It is said that there are only two such companies in our country who live with us from birth to death
 ek he bata or doosraa he tata
 Tata makes salt to tea to ships
 in dinon tata kaa naam uttaradhikari vivaad kii vajah se phir se surkhiyon main he
 Cyrus Mistry, the chairman of this group, was given a go
 ratan tata phir se is company ko sanbhaalane ke liye aage aa gaye hai
 At the age of 80, when most people take bed after retirement
 ve phir se sabakuch sahi karne ke liye kendriya bhoomika main aa chuke hai
 Obviously, not everything comes into the public eye, but the Tatas are not even crazy people
 log unke is faisle par aitraaj jataa rahe hai, magar is baat se shaayad hi koi asahmat he ki ve akut pratibha or duuradrushti vaale insaan hai
 In such a situation, you should also learn what are the things that make Ratan Tata special in general and what you can learn from them
 1
 They only give priority to work
 
 
 aisa bharat ke kai audyogic gharaanon ke saath hota he ki ve udyog ke saath-saath raajnneeti main bhi dilchaspee lene lagate hai
 At the same time, the Tata group and especially Ratan Tata have always avoided these things
 ve hameshaa apane lakshya ko lekar sanjeeda rahete hai
 They believe that this leads to the loss of both genres
 2
 They take work as worship
 
 
 aisa bhi nahin he ki ve hameshaa se hi is pojishan main rahe hon
 After studying, he was also offered a job by IBM
 haalanki ve family bijness kii ore mud gaye
 There too, he continued to work and understood his work
 3
 Give full respect to others
 
 
 ratan tata ko nijee taur par jaanane waalon kaa kahana he ki ve hameshaa hi shant or saumy bane rahete hai
 They meet with great love from the smallest employee of their company
 4
 Do not disobey your promise 
 
 agar aapako yaad ho to unhone bharat kii janata kolkhatkia kardene ke vaada kiya tha
 No matter how many problems came after that, but they did not give up on their promise
 parinaam ham sabhi ke saamne he
 5
 ek hi saath kai dhandhon main haath daalana
 
 
 Such small but special quality makes a common man a legend
 ve tata group kaa chairman hone ke saath-saath mitsubisi korporation, booj ailen hamiltan or je pi morgan jaisi badi companiyon ke board main sadsy bhi hai
 Obviously everyone wants to take advantage of their experience
 to aap bhi unki qualities ko apni jindagi main shaamil karen or bas chaa jaaen
 Denying any reconciliation talks with the party's central leadership, BJP veteran BS Yeddyurappa in Karnataka said he was considering forming his own party
 yediurppa ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘‘main kisi rashtriya dal main shaamil hone nahin ja rahaa hum
 Maybe i can form a new party
 main sambhavat: disambar main rajya kaa daura karne ke baad apane faisle kii ghoshnaa karuunga
 Earlier it was being said that Yeddyurappa is exploring the option of joining Janata Party, Samajwadi Party or Janata Dal (united)
 party main haashiye par daale jane kii vajah se bhaajapa netritv se naaraaz chal rahe yediurppa ne kisi tarah kii sulah vaarta se inkaar karte hue kaha ‘bhaajapa alaakaman se koi charchaa karnaa mere liye band ho chukaa adhyay he
 Yeddyurappa, a veteran of the Lingayat community, formed the first BJP government in South India in the last assembly elections under his leadership
 unhone kaha ki vah bhaajapa vidhayakon sahit apane samarthakon se apni party main shaamil hone ko nahin kahenge
 The former chief minister said he was firm on his decision not to accept the offer of any post by the party

 party ke aalaa sutron ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki kisi kendriya netaa ko bihar main vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladvaya jayega
 According to sources, the biggest issue for BJP in this election is the alliance of Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar as it involves both jungle raj and lack of development
 party poochhegi ki jo nitish kumaar 17 saal kii umr se congress kaa or pichley bees saal se lalu prasad kaa virodh karte rahe, aaj ve unke saath kyon ja rahe hai? bijepi kaa aarope he ki nitish aisa sirf mukhyamantri banane ke liye kar rahe hai or unhen bihar kii phikr nahin he
 BJP is constantly in trouble with the statements of Shatrughan Sinha
 party sutron ke mutabik unke bayanon par party kii najar he or uchit samay par uchit karrwai kii jaaegi
 The BJP believes that the assembly elections in Bihar should be held between Dussehra and Diwali
 kai duusari partiyon kii bhi yahi raay he jise chunaav ayog ko bataa diya gaya he
 bjp's allies are pressing that the seat-sharing should be done as soon as possible
 magar bijepi jaldbaaji main nahin he
 He says that allies will be spoken at the right time and there is no fixed formula for seat sharing
 bijepi ne yah bhi tay kiya he ki vah apane ummidavaaron kaa naam chunaav ke elaan ke baad hi ghoshit karegi
 The BJP is being asked how she can target the functioning of her government when she herself was with Nitish Kumar for seven years
 is par bijepi ke aalaa netaaon kaa kahana he ki 'puri credit bijepi ko jaati he
 You calculate the seven years of BJP and the remaining three years
 ham puure samay akele hote to zyada acha hota
 If a little development took place, it was due to the strength of ninety mlas of BJP
 'tippaniyan BJP says the election in Bihar will be Nitish Kumar vs Kamal
 party ko bharosa he ki chunaav main uski jeet hogi
 The party claims that the issue of development is in prominence and a large number of people will vote for the BJP to rise above the caste base
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri kaa naam sansadeey board tay karegaa
 BJP has also targeted Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for campaigning in favor of Nitish Kumar
 bijepi kejariwal se poochhegi ki kya ve lalu prasad or congress kaa prachaar karenge yaa nahin kyonki nitish kaa gathbandhan unke saath he
 Top party sources also made it clear that no central leader will be contesting assembly elections in Bihar
 bijepi shatrughna sinha ke bayanon se lagaataar pareshaani main he
 According to party sources, the party is eyeing his statements and appropriate action will be taken at the appropriate time
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki bihar main vidhansabha ke chunaav dashahara or diwaali ke bich hone chahie

 My hope and prayer is that this will never happen

 i know that when my husband asked for help, he said, 'jafri, you are a lot of yourself
 agar aap bachaa sakate hai to khud ko bachaaiye’
 Zakia alleged, "I also know that the Indian justice system may be slow but it is strong
" agar mukhyamantri ne istipha de diya hota yah unhen pad se hataa diya gaya hota, nyaay kaa pahiyaa swatantra rup se or teji se chalata
 But he said that instead of stepping down, he doubled his grip on power and created every possible obstacle to not give justice to the victims

 Rating: 4 Stardirector: Clint Eastwood Artist: Bradley Cooper, Saina Miller, Luke Grimes, and Jack mcdermann: An 84-year-old director dares to bring to the big screen the story of an American hero who killed 160 enemies with his gun during the Iraq campaigns
 is diarector ke hausale buland the or kris kyle naam ke america sena ke itihaas ke diggaj navy cills kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaale iske lead actor breadle kupar ke bhi
 The duo's hard work paid off and the American sniper received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor
 jab clint is film ko banane ja rahe the to usee samay kyle ke pita ne unhen kah diya tha ki film main unke bete kii kahani waisi hi dikhaai jaani chahie jaisi thi
 Clint tries to do the same throughout the film
 yahi nahin, jab breadle kyle ke pita se mili the to unhone kaha ki meraa betaa tumse doguna tha
 Bradley understood his gesture and adapted himself into a Kyle-like height
 unhone vajan badhaayaa, or kyle jaise style ko parade par utaara
 The film is based on Clint Eastwood's 'american Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in US Military History'
 'american sniper' texas ke couboy kris kyle kii kahani he, jo apane jivan main makasad ko khojataa he or aakhirkaar use yah makasad navy cills main jaakar miltaa he
 From where he goes on four expeditions to Iraq
 vahaan vah alag tarah kaa maahaul dekhtaa he or jis tarah ke kaam kii use training mili hoti he, use bakhubi anjaam detaa he
 Loves a girl and also marries
 lekin in abhiyaanon ke dauraan vah apni paariwarik jindagi ko miss karata he
 But when he comes home from duty, he starts living a normal life
 us samay uske saath kuch aisa ghatata he, jo soch se pare hota he
 Bradley gave his best performance so far in this film
 clint kaa film banane kaa apana style he
 The same style is also in American sniper
 film sirf kyle kii jindagi dikhaati he, or har frem main kailes or uski jindagi hi rahati he
 In one scene, if he is battling in Iraq, then in the second scene about his family life
 film main kasaavat he, lekin ant kuch tang karata he, film ekadam se khatm ho jaati he, or kai sawaal adhure rah jate hai
 Maybe this is Clint's style
 vaaki, byopix ke maamle menek shandaar film

 The Chennai bowlers did not allow the Royals to take advantage of a good start before the lavish performances of Hussey (79 not out) and Raina (61)

 chennai kii yah nau match main chhathi jeet he or vah 12 ank lekar ank talika main tisare sthaan par kabiz ho gaya he
 The Royals tasted defeat after three consecutive wins
 uske ab das match main 11 ank hai or vah ank talika main chauthe sthaan par khisak gaya he
 Hussey and Raina did not show any kind of rapture and tried successfully to put pressure on the bowlers, preferring to rotate the strike
 shen warn se shuru se hi gendbaaji main lagaataar badlaav kiye lekin unki yah ranneeti kargar sabit nahin hui
 Chennai had scored 73 runs for one wicket for ten overs
 royles kii taraf se gendbaaji kaa aagaaj karne vaale nayan doshi ko warn ne jab 11wein over main duusare spel ke liye bulaayaa to raina or hassi ne apane haath khole
 Both of them shared 19 runs in this over of this spinner

 Though the shop is just below the house, Bhuvanesh is seen coming from the front
 darasal, wo gali ke hi duusare chor par maujuud mandir main darshan karne ke baad laut rahaa he
 Bhuvanesh used to visit the temple every morning
 uske baad dukaan kholta tha
 That picture is also on the morning of 30 June
 isamen priyanka apni maa ke saath subah saiyr karti nazar aa rahi he
 That is, everything was like normal days in the Rathi family's house on Saturday morning
 bhopal singh rathi kaa doosraa bethaa lalit har mangalvaar or shanivaar kii subah ghar ke kareeb hi mandir jaaya karata tha
 It was Saturday on 30 June
 bade bhai bhuwanesh ke mandir jane ke ek ghante ke baad subah saat baje lalit bhi mandir jaataa he, phir laut kar dukaan par baith jaataa he
 The Rathi family has another shop, in the basement under the same house, or rather the warehouse is of plywood
 30 june ko hi subah kareeb das baje ye godaam bhi khul jaataa he
 One was the summer vacation from Saturday upstairs so the children's schools were closed

 This time he reached a mobile shop to recharge the phone
 dukaan ke sisitivi camere main lalit ko aakhri baar dekha gaya
 After this, Lalit goes to Burari to buy the contents of a havan from a shop
 havan saamagree ke alaava ramanami gamchaa, chunni, coton or doctor tepe bhi kharidta he
 Lalit then sits at the shop for a while
 shaam kareeb saadhe saat baje plywood kaa godaam band ho jaataa he
 But the shop was still open
 chunki dukaan gali main or rozmarra kii chizein bikati hai
 So the shop was usually open till ten o'clock at night
 lekin tees june ko dukaan raat saadhe das baje tak khuli hui thi
 Actually, Lalit had ordered dinner
 raat das baje ke kareeb plastic ke chah stool ghar main laae jate hai
 Lalit's wife Neetu and Lalit's sister are seen in the camera, bringing six stools in a CCTV camera
 jabaki das baj kar bees minute par bhuwanesh or lalit ke bachche neeche kii dukaan se taar lekar upar aate hai
 According to Lalit, there was no cooking at home on the night of June 30
 or khaane main bhi sirf roti khaani thi
 That too outside
 raat thik das baj kar chalis minute priyanka or uske do kazan ghar se neeche utarate hai
 Khan 
 udhar, bhuwanesh ab dukaan kaa shater band karne ja rahaa tha
 That's when a boy reaches for food
 khaane ke naam par kul 20 rotiyaan priyanka ko detaa he
 Some people in the family eat food at the same time
 yani sirf roti
 After this, at eleven o'clock at night, Lalit takes a walk outside the house with his pet dog Tommy
 qareeb bees minute tak lalit kute ke saath baahar tahalta he
 During this, many neighbors also see him
 phir kareeb saadhe gyaarah baje wo ghar laut aata he
 a neighbor of the Rathi family was last seen by a neighbor
 iske baad is ghar se rathi parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy baahar nahin niklaa or naa hi koi ghar ke andar gaya

 film kii kahani aapako le jaaegi pracheen bharat main, jahaan chuaachhut jaisi prathaon se shudra samaaj aahat tha
 
 
 Where some people of Shudra society take up arms against the injustice of the landlords and the entire Shudra society scorches in the fire of the zamindars' anger
 
 
 kahani ko parde par bakhubi utaara gaya he, phir chaahe vah pani ke liye jaddojahad ho, mantron ke jaap par roak ho yaa phir shudra samaaj kii mahilaon ke saath jor-jabardastee
 
 
 The comments shudra samaaj par atyaachaar kii kahaniyaan hamane bahut suni hai, isliye kahani kuch nayaa to nahin kahati, lekin baandhe rakhti he
 
 
 All the actors of the film are new, but since they are from the theater, the stage can definitely be seen in their performances somewhere in the film
 
 
 becoground music or uske bol khaastaur par prabhaav daalate hai
 
 
 Simply, the film lacked two things - first, the tone of the film, which runs at the same level
 
 
 doosraa, iske dialog, jo behatar likhe ja sakate the
 
 
 By the way, this film is made with a good intention, which gives a message to the society and proves that even with a low budget and low facilities, a big message can be given
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star
 
 
 We have heard many stories of atrocities on the Shudra society, so the story does not say anything new, but keeps it tied
 
 
 film ke sabhi kalakaar nae hai, parantu chunki rangamanch se hai, isiilie film main kahin-kahin unke abhinay main stage kii jhalak bhi zarur dikhti he
 
 
 Background music and its lyrics are particularly influential

 congress party ke varisht netaaon ne maharashtra congress (congress)ke netaaon ke sathbaithak kii
 It has been reported from the sources that the Congress will support Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik ensipi (ncp)netaa sharad pavaar ke paas congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi)kaa phone aayaa tha
 Sonia agreed to Pawar over the phone
 sutron ke mutabik abhi tak congress or ensipi ne shivasena ko samarthan dene kii koi aadhikarik pushti nahin kii he
 The Congress has issued a letter saying that it wants to discuss more with the NCP
 bataa den kiisse pehlecongresswarking cameti (CWC) kii baithak hui thi
 After leaving the meeting, senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge had said that the right aspects have been discussed in this meeting which started from 10 am
 aakhir main party kevarisht netaaonne yah tay kiya tha ki ham maharashtra congress ke netaaon ke saath baithak karne ke baad hi kisi faisle par pahunchenge
 He had told that the party has invited senior leaders of Maharashtra Congress for a meeting at four in the evening
 bataa den ki maharashtra main BJP sarkaar nahin banaaegi yah ab saaf ho gaya he
 In such a situation, all eyes are now on the Shiv sena-congress and NCP
 NCP pramukh sharad pavaarane Shiv Sena ke saath sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar bada bayaan diya tha
 He had said that we are not going to take any decision to form the government without talking to the Congress
 udhar, congress party ne maharashtra ke maujuuda raajnneetik halaat ko lekar CWC kii baithak bulaai thi
 Amidst all this, Shiv Sena's only minister in the Center's Modi government Arvind Sawant announced his resignation
 twitorper istife ke faisle kii jaankaree dete hue unhone kaha tha ki shivasena kaa paksh sachai he
 Could not live with a false environment
 yah faisla unhone aise samayamein kiya he jab maharashtra main shivasena, congress or ensipi kii sarkaar banane kii khabaren hai
 With the announcement of Arvind Sawant's resignation, it has been decided that the Shiv Sena is out of the NDA
 shivasena or bijepi kii dosti 30 saal puraani thi
 It is believed that the NCP had put a condition before the Shiv Sena to form a government in Maharashtra that it would have to break ties with the NDA first
 haalanki maharashtra main shivasena or ensipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke bhi samarthan jarurat padegi
 But Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the meeting is going to be held at 10 o'clock today and the decision will be taken according to the instructions of the high command
 lekin uske saath hi unhone kaha ki abhi tak kaa jo faisla he ki hamen vipaksh main hi baithna chahie
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 lagaataar do satron main sansad main vastu or seva kar (jiesti) vidheyak ko pesh na kar paane kii laachaari se hataash hokar kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari main kaha ki congress ke aalaa netaaon ko rukaawat main “parpida sukh” hasil ho rahaa he
 There may be two opinions on the matter of happiness, but the country's oldest party has managed to stop many important bills like GST, Land Acquisition Amendment
 so, is vidhaayi gatirodh ke liye jetali ke doshaaropan ko galat nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But the finance minister cannot blame the Congress for the failures of his government in taking legislative initiatives
 piares legislative research ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik, 26 may, 2014 ko centre main shapath grahan ke baad narendra modi sarkaar kul 74 nae vidheyak yani har saal ausatan 37 vidheyak lekar ai he
 But according to the sessions of Parliament, the bills introduced in the last four sessions have been reduced by half
 masalan, 2014 ke sheetakaaleen satr main 16 vidheyak pesh kiye gaye to 2015 ke sheet satr main aath vidheyak hi pesh kiye gaye
 In fact, in the current budget session, the government did not introduce a single bill in Parliament
 pichley do saal main sarkaar ne sirf 23 nae vidheyakon kaa majamoon taiyaar kiya
 When India Today put this figure in front of Jaitley, the finance minister had only a whole lot to say in defense, "the governance of the country is not just about legislative work
 ”unke sahyogi, kendriya shahari vikaas, awaas tathaa shahari garibi unmoolan or sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar kaa jor “maatra badhaane par nahin, balki gunvattta” par he
 He says, "the question is not just about the number of Bills, but the political will and the introduction of programs at the ground level is only part of the legislative process
 
 
 hamaara antim lakshya vikaas or sushasan he
 According to Naidu, the government is engaged in reviewing and revising the outdated laws for its purpose of "minimum government and maximum good governance"
 ve kehete hai, “mahatv kii baat yah he ki lambey samay se lambit muddon ko nibataya ja rahaa he or behad jaruri hone par hi nae vidheyak laae ja rahe hai
 We passed the Bangladesh Land Transfer Bill which had been hanging since the 1970s
 rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog vidheyak or real estate vidheyak bhi isi shrenee main aate hai
 "but the figures do not testify to Naidu's plea as only eight of the 60 Lok Sabha bills have passed in the 16th Lok Sabha
 14veen loksabhaa main 30 lambit vidheyakon main se chah or 15veen loksabhaa main 37 lambit vidheyakon main se aath paarit hue the
 His junior, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi blames this on the opposition as well
 ve kehete hai, “sansad kii kaary mantranaa samiti main sabhi dalon ke sadsy hai
 When so many bills are pending, the members of the committee prefer only the old legislators
 nae vidheyakon par vichaar nahin kiya jaataa
 "though they admit that the government is somewhat sluggish in legislative work, but also say that the government is not introducing the new bill in Rajya Sabha because of the" politics of stalemate "of the opposition
 ve kehete hai, “ham loksabhaa main to vidheyakon ko paas kar sakate hai lekin ye ucch sadan main jaakar ruk jate hai
 In order to cut the blame for "sadistic attitude", the Congress does not allow these figures to attack the saffron party
 congress ke rajyasabha sadsy ahamed patel kehete hai, “ye aankade hi bataa dete hai ki modi sarkaar ke paas kisi nae vichaar or kanoon banane kii ichhashakti kaa abhaav he
 They may blame the Congress, but we have supported every new and people-oriented bill in the House
 ”unhone fouran upie sarkaar ke vidhaayi kaamkaaj ke piares ke aankadon kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa
 During UPA-1, 245 new Bills were introduced in the 14th Lok Sabha i
e
 49 Bills on an average annually
 upie-2 ke daur main 15veen loksabhaa main 228 nae vidheyak yani salanaa 46 vidheyak pesh kiye gaye
 The lack of legislative functioning in UPA-2 is mainly due to no functioning in the 2010 Lok Sabha cold session
 us samay vipakshi dal bijepi ne 2ji spectrum ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye sanyukt sansadeey samiti ke gathan kii maang ke saath donon sadanon main baari gatirodh paidaa kar diya tha (loksabhaa kaa 94 pratishat samay barbaad hua to rajyasabha kaa 98 pratishat)
 In the UPA-II era, the functioning of the 15th Lok Sabha was the lowest in the last five decades
 vipaksh 2ji ghotaale, koyala block aavanton main aniyamitata, khudara bazaar main epadi ko manjuuri or kendriya satarkta ayukta kii niyukti jaise sawaalon par sansad main gatirodh banaae hue tha
 According to PRS, only 61 percent of the work was done in the Lok Sabha and 66 percent in the Rajya Sabha
 tab jetali ne apni party ke ravaie ko yah kahkar jaij tehraaya tha ki sansad main rukaawat paidaa karnaa loktantric prakriya kaa hissaa hota he
 But now with an overwhelming majority of 282 seats in the Lok Sabha, his party is describing itself as a victim and accusing the Congress of obstructing the legislative work with its strength in the Rajya Sabha
 lekin endie-2 ke satta main aane ke baad sansadeey kaamkaaj kii samiksha se kuch or hi kahani khulti he
 In the first five sessions under the Modi government, 704 hours of work was done in the Lok Sabha out of 711 hours
 ab isaki tulana jaraa upie-2 ke pehle paanch satron se kiijie
 Then 549 hours were worked out of a total of 768 hours
 agar ham bajet satr ko hataa den to pichley chaar satron main loksabhaa main rajyasabha ke mukaable zyada kaamkaaj hua, jo kramshah 97 pratishat or 62 pratishat rahaa
 The 2015 budget session has seen the highest performance
 loksabhaa main 122 pratishat or rajyasabha main 101 pratishat kaamkaaj hua, jo sansad ke pichley 20 satron main sabase adhik rahaa he
 The Congress certainly showed its strength in the Rajya Sabha and nearly 40 percent of the working hours were absorbed, yet six bills were passed without debate in the House
 haalanki 16veen loksabhaa main kuch satron main acha kaamkaaj hua he
 71 percent of the bills were introduced in the 2015 winter session and passed in the same session, the highest in the past 10 years
 phir bhi chaahe jo bhi sarkaar rahe, sansad ke vidhaayi kaamkaaj main lagaataar giravat ai he
 The fact is that during the first eight parliamentary sessions of UPA-2, 38 percent of the time went into stalemate
 congress ke mukhya sachetak jyotiraditya sindhiya endie-1 kii tulana main endie-2 kii susti or upie ke daur main sansadeey kaamkaaj main kami main fark karte hai
 He says, "this government is just a master at raising breathtaking slogans
" vidhaayi kaamkaaj ke liye thos soch or duuradrushti kii jarurat hoti he lekin yah sarkaar to ahankaar main hi mast he
 "former Union Minister Scindia agrees with the current Finance Minister that the country does not just run from legislative work but he challenges the government to implement its" much hyped "schemes Make in India, Jan Dhan Yojana and Swachh Bharat
 Let's tell the reality ve kehete hai, “ye sabhi yojanaayen mahaj prachaar ke liye hai, jameen par unka asar behad kam he
 "the political confrontation has become the sharpest since the Uttarakhand case, so there is a high probability of staying deadlock on bills like GST in Rajya Sabha
 phir 2019 tak ucch sadan main bijepi ke haq main ganit badalane kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 In such a situation, a section in the saffron party is advocating a "time cutting" strategy
 bijepi ke ek saansad kehete hai, “rajyasabha anischitkaal tak vidheyakon ko roak nahin sakati
 If a bill is not rejected or passed and the opposition continues to obstruct, then the government should call a joint session of Parliament, for which we have the strength
 isse hamaara vidhaayi kaamkaaj behatar ho jayega
 However, whether the Congress' "sadistic" opposition or the Modi government's failure to take the opposition along, Parliament has deviated from its original work of legislation
 pakistan cricket board (pisibi) ne sattebaaj se sampark karne kii baat board ko na bataane ke liye harfanmaulaa khilaadi mohammad navaj ko do maheene ke liye nilambit kar diya he
 They have also been fined two thousand dollars

 This ban will come into effect from 16 May
 'pisibi ne kaha he kinvaaj ko board ne bhrashtachar rodhi niyam ke anuchhed 2

 The PAK army said white lies, now said - only one Indian pilot, under our control, knows how expert he is in lying, the whole world knows
 vah khud bhi apni harkaton se yah sabit karata rahata he ki use sach pasand nahin he
 Now once again the spokesman of the Pakistan Army has himself given proof that as much lies are lied against India on his soil

 Even after four months of breaking the JDU-BJP alliance, the leaders of both parties are not full of heart
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki saarvajanik manch par jediu or bijepi vidhayak bhid gaye
 JDU Legislative Councilor and former Bihar government minister Devesh Chandra Thakur gave the title of Asaram to the Mehanar MLA of Vaishali district from the dais

 On his turn, the BJP MLA started discussing the failures of the JDU government in the state
 apni baari aane par devesh chandra ne pehle to sthapana diwas ke manch par raajnneetik charchaa ke liye bijepi vidhayak ko naseehat di phir unhen asaram kii jagah chale jane kii salaah de di
 How much the BJP mlas were stung by the comments of Devesh Chandra can be gauged from the fact that when the media workers spoke on this issue, the cameras started falling off
 haalanki sabha ke baad jediu mantri vrushan patel ne ise halkaa-phulka majaak kah maamle ko rafa dfa karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Time is changing; Politicians who once waded in Asaram's feet are going to hear Asaram's name today

 5 stardharm or aasthaa par pichley kuch saalon main kai filmein banaai gai hai, jaise 'oh maay god' or 'pike'
 These films also earned well, so the formula became a way to earn on religion and in the same episode another film is going to be released this week 'dharam Sankat Mein', now will this film show the same feat, let's know Story of the film
 
 
 'dharam sankat main' paresh rawal ke teen avatargujrat ke ahmedabad main rahane vaala dharmpal trivedi (paresh rawal) hindu he lekin uski maa ke dehanth ke baad jab bank loker kholaa jaataa he tab use pataa chalata he ki vah ek musalmaan kii santan he or maa ne anathalay se kisi karanvash use god liya tha
 He keeps this information to himself and does not even tell his family, then one by one he is confronted by Nawab Nazim Ali Shah Khan Bahadur (anu Kapoor) or sometimes Nilanand Baba (naseeruddin Shah)
 film main ek kaaran hota he jisaki vajah se wo hindu or muslim dharm ke sankat main fansaa rahata he or aakhirkaar sab kuch thik ho hi jaataa he
 In this film full of comedy, Paresh Rawal's best acting and comic timing is seen, while Anu Kapoor gets to hear from all over the Urdu tongue
 nasiruddin shah kii maujuudagi film main stylish baba ke rup main he jo atarangi juuton ke saath saath bike bhi chalaata he, lekin naseer saab kaa kirdaar or bhi anokhaa banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The dialogues of the film are quite interesting, sometimes you get to hear the best Urdu alphas like Gushalkhana, Jahil, Fitnagiri, Iljam, Istakabal, Tasarif, while Neelanand Baba's dialogue 'tum me jahar do, main tumhe duniya' will also be on your face
 Let's bring a smile
 film main hansi ke thahaake kabhi kabhi aise lagate hai ki seen khatm hone ke baad tak bhi aap hansate rahete hai
 The film seems to be lengthening after a time which could have been shorter and especially the number of songs could have been reduced, because the moment the songs arrive, they divert your attention from the story rather than attract it
 diarector phuwaad khan ne videshi film 'da infidel' kii rimek banaai he lekin darshakon kii apeksha par puri tarah se khari shaayad naa utar paae kyonki pehle hi 'oh maay god' jaisi badi hit film ban chuki he or darshakon kii apekshaayen ab usase bhi zyada ho chuki hai
 By the way, if you are a fan of Paresh Rawal, Naseeruddin Shah or Anu Kapoor, then definitely watch this film because sometimes laughter comes right

 The most troublesome thing there is employment, whose only means is tourism

 vah jagah jananath he or hamaari sarkaar ko kashmir ko or acha banane ke liye prayaas karne chahie
 "sonam Arora said about her role in the film," My character was Ravi Kishan's wife

 It is alleged that the four gang-raped the girl while she was alone in her house

 The case is Dhidhaulika, a village in Kemuradnagar police station area

 Meanwhile, the BJP has been working on the social engineering formula to retain its power
 yahi kaaran he ki patidaaron kii naaraazgi kii bharpai ke liye bijepi ne nayaa siyaasi tod nikaala he
 The party's central leadership of the BJP has mobilized the Other Backward Classes (OBC)

 The BJP won 115 seats in the last assembly election with nearly 47 percent votes
 vahiin, congress ne 39 fisadi vot paakar 61 seat jeetne main safal rahi
 BJP has changed its social equation in view of the displeasure of the Patidars
 bijepi ne patidaaron kii jagah apane aapako obasi samudaay kii taraf jhukaa diya he
 Not only did the BJP not satisfy the demand for reservation for the Patidars, while the Patidar community has been angry on one side, it has worked to bring the obcs to themselves
 bataa den ki patidaar gujarat main obisi kii varg main shaamil hone kii maang kar rahe the or obisi samudaay patelon kii is maang ke khilaaf the
 The BJP insisted on 54 per cent of the votes in Gujarat instead of 18 per cent
 bijepi pradhanmantri narendra modi kii obisi card ko cash karaane ke mood main he
 Not only this, the BJP is also making a dent in the recently formed President Ram Kovind's caste (koli)

 Modi comes from Modh Ghanchi (teli) caste
 bataa den ki rajya main ghanchi samudaay kii aabaadi kareeb 6 fisadi he
 In such a situation, the party is trying to make a place among the OBC society through PM Modi's OBC card
 obisi matadaataaon ke bich behatar talmail baitaakar rajya kii siyaasi ladaai ko fatah kar sake
 The state has plans to deal with many backward castes, sub-castes and groups

 About 9 percent of the population of the Koli community is in the state
 coli samaaj congress kaa paramparaagat voter mana jaataa rahaa he, jisamen bijepi send lagane main juty he
 The BJP is making the argument for this that for the first time, the person of Koli society has done the job of putting the country in the highest position
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main obisi matadaata badi sankhya main he
 In such a situation, the BJP has focused its attention on the OBC vote bank for damage control

 Their families also placed stones on the heart and sent them there
 lekin unhen kya pataa tha ki unke laadle vatan lautenge to maut ke tabuton main band ho kar
 Among the 38 remains brought from Iraq were also the remains of Surjeet Maneka residing in Adampur, Jalandhar
 driver or helper ke taur par kaam karne vaala surajeet videsh main acha kamaane kii aas ke saath ek travel agent ke chakkar main funs gaya
 He took the money and promised to send Surjeet to Afghanistan but reached Dubai
 surajeet ke bhai omprakash ke mutabik surajeet ne 2013 main teen maheene bahut mushkil se dubai main gujaarey
 Surjeet kept waiting that one day he would be sent to Afghanistan
 dubai jaise mahange shahar main surajeet simit paise ke saath kaise zyada din guzaar saktaa tha
 After exhausting, he returned to India
 bharat aane ke baad usne parivaar waalon ke saath travel agent ko pakadaa
 According to Omprakash, the travel agent offered to send Surjeet to Kuwait to resolve the matter
 saath hi 45,000 rupye kii or maang kii
 Surjeet again got into the trap

 Omprakash told that Surjeet used to tell from Iraq constantly on the phone how difficult conditions are there

 If you do not work, then you are punished by starving
 surajeet kii aapbeetee sunakar omprakash or parivaar ke baaki sadsy use bharat laut aane ke liye kehete
 Surjeet's answer to him was that it is not possible to return to the situation there
 surajeet ne june 2014 main aakhri baar bhai omprakash ko phone kiya tha
 Surjeet said in that call that he does not know if he will ever be able to return home alive
 tab surajeet ne ek video bhi bheja tha jo us vakt iraq ke visphotak halaat kii khud gavaahi detaa tha
 The blast is clearly heard in that video with black smoke rising from a building

 The reason is unemployment and the worry of raising the bread for the family on 2 June
 surajeet ke bhai omprakash ke mutabik unke ilaake main itani berogari he ki log karen to or karen kya? ye log bacchon ko bhukh se bachaane ke liye har tarah kaa khatra uthaane ko taiyaar hai

 charanjit ke mutabik vahaan jane ke alaava koi chaara bhi nahin he
 There is no such work for them here in the country so that the family can earn enough to earn enough
 charanjit saath hi maanate hai ki khadi desh main kaam karne kii vajah se unke parivaar ko hameshaa unki phikr lagi rahati he
 In such a situation, they always give courage to their family
 punjab ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki kin halaat main rajya ke yuvaaon ko khadi deshon ke liye palaayan karnaa padataa hai
 But here too they do not miss political accusations
 jalandhar se akali dal ke vidhayak pawan singh tinu naujavaanon ke palaayan ke liye system ko dosha dete hai
 Now the second thing is that they have been a part of this system till recently
 tinu kehete hai ki sarkari nitiyaan garibon ke paksh main nahin hai, agar garibon ke paksh main hotin to 70 saal kii aazaadee ke baad bhi yuvaaon ko is tarah berogari ke chalate khadi deshon main jane kaa khatra nahin uthaanaa padataa
 Tinu does not miss to say that he gave government job to 2 lakh people under Akali Dal rule, but before that Congress government could give government job to only 27 thousand people
 raajnneeti apni chaal chalati rahati he lekin ye hakeekat he ki berozegaar yuvaaon kii phikr kisi ko nahin
 In search of livelihood, countless young men like Surjit get caught in the tomb of pigeons and reach the Gulf countries
 ye jaanate hue bhi vahaan jaan ko khatra ho saktaa he
 But if the question of filling up the family is in front, then they do not even care about this danger

 In Delhi, which is battling dengue and chikungunya, the quarrel between the Lieutenant Governor and the Kejriwal government is not taking its name
 aam aadmi party sarkaar bhale hi ek dilli kaa naaraa laga rahi ho, lekin mantri kapil mishra apni chitthee se uparajyapal ko nishaanaa bananaa nahin bhul rahe hai
 Actually, the real reason for writing the letter is the call, where the Lt Governor sent a fax to Manish Sisodia to leave his work in Finland and return to Delhi
 kapil mishrane alji se sawaal poocha he ki bada hi acha hota ki aap mujhe yaa satyendra jain ji ko bulaakar agar aapke man main kuch chintaaen he to baat kar lete
 Kapil Mishra said that on 14th, the Health Minister held a meeting of all the officials
 aapane us meeting ke thik ek ghante baad unheen adhikariyon ke saath ek or meeting bhi kii
 The Health Minister was present at the meeting you called
 vahaan aisi koi chintaa aapaki taraf se nahin saamne ai
 Tell us the secret of sending fax to Manish Sisodiyak in Finland instead of calling and talking sir
 ?kapil ne alji se aspataalon kaa daura karne or saath main foging karne kii apil kii he
 The minister has written in his letter that little by little the Mayor and officials of the Municipal Corporation meet together and review what is being done for the prevention
 shaayad aapke kuch nae suzav bhi mil jaaen
 i have some doubts and suggestions that i am sharing with you: -1
 manish sisodiya ko fax bhejne se lagbhag do din pehle tak aap america main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe the
 This time you had gone on a long vacation
 america main kahaan gaye the, kisi chhuttiyaan manaai vahaan ki koi photo kisi tivi channel ke madhyam se dekhne ko nahin mil pai
 There is a question in my mind, Chikungunya and dengue was spread in the city but you did not finish your vacation in between
 koi khoj khabar bhi nahin lee vahaan se
 On one hand, you came back not less than an hour of your vacation and in the 24 hours of coming to the other side, faxed Manish Sisodia to leave work and come back? Didn't understand this, sir
 2
 Impulse marketing was being done on a channel-specific teleshopping style
 shaayad aap par uskaa prabhaav pad gaya ho
 i want to understand that Manish Sisodia is coming back tomorrow anyway, by sending a fax to him, what do you want to discuss? i and Satyendra Jain are right here, tell me, we come and discuss with you what you want to do with Manishji
 aap is shahar ke administrator he, mantri hone ke naate main samajhaana chahta hum ki aapke aise riection se kisi tivi channel kaa bhala to ho saktaa he par shahar main painic failata he
 Do not do this

 aisi kitni hi dharanaen hai lathi ke bare main
 So, let's tell the story today of sticks
 police kii lathi kii
 No colonel's stick, no union punishment, no harveyor's bond
 
 
 police kii lathi
 Its journey from the beginning of becoming a police weapon to being modern and fashionable
 aksar police bhaanjati he laathiyandesh main bhar main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon (CAA) or enarasi (NRC) ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 Meanwhile, police are charging lathi to maintain law and order and control the crowd
 laathiyaan bhanjakar hi bheed ko niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Despite having one to one sophisticated weapon, lathi means cane is used more by the police
 police kii bent koi aam lathi nahin hoti
 Rather it is specially made
 yahi nahin ise chalaane ke liye baqayda pulicekarmiyon se lekar afasaron tak ko training bhi di jaati he
 It has been used since the British era, when the British ruled India, they used to torture Indians a lot
 kar vasuulne ke liye har tarika istemaal karte the
 Lathi sticks were used to control the crowd of people involved in the freedom struggle
 tabhi se lathi kaa chalan police main aayaa
 Flexible cane, rather than solid wood, was used to make it
 uttar pradesh ke purv police mahanideshak or vartmaan main upiessi ke sadsy alok prasad bataate hai ki police main bent kaa istemaal britishkaal se hi hota aayaa he
 Cane is flexible
 iske waar se fracture nahin hota
 Its purpose is not to harm anyone
 uddeshy ye hota he ki chot lage lekin isse bada nuksaan naa ho
 It can also be called a human aspect of the police
 lathi chalaane kaa prashikshanmuradabad police academy ke ek varisht adhikari ne jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki bent yani lathi chalaanaa bhi rhite control drill kaa ek ahm part hota he
 All the policemen in the police academy are trained in this
 lathi drill ke dauraan is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa jaataa he ki bent insaan ke sharir par kisi aise hisse par naa pade, jahaan use gambhir chot lag sakati ho
 Sticks are often struck on the back of the legs below the torso
 asli uddeshy bheed ko teetar-bitar karnaa hi hota he
 He informed that IPS officers are also given training to run cane in the National Police Academy
 muzaffarnagar main banati hai laathiyanuttar pradesh ke muzaffarnagar jile main bent yaa lathi banane kaa kaam kiya jaataa he
 Many families have been doing cane making in this district for years
 bent banane vaale aag kii bhattiyon main bans ko tapa kar bent or lathi taiyaar karte hai
 There are several Gaushala Road cane factories in Muzaffarnagar
 bent banane ke liye bans bihar or assam se mangaya jaataa he
 Factories bamboo is cleaned and heated in fire
 phir rang rogan kar inhen khubasurat banaaya jaataa he
 Mirzapur's cane is no less; Mirzapur's cane or lathi of UP is also very famous
 jise nepal tak bheja jaataa he
 a special type of bamboo is found in the forests of Kushira in Mirzapur and Manda in Allahabad
 inase bhi kadi mashkkat ke baad bent banaai jaati hai
 According to experts, the wood in the bamboo plant is crooked
 tab karigar der tak uski safai karte hai
 Let's make the cane straight
 use tel lagaakar khule aasmaan ke neeche rakhaa jaataa he
 Then the cane is ready
 kuch pulicekarmi bataate hai ki mirzapur kii bent tej chot karti he
 If the lathidor of modern police changed, then the police also changed
 or aise badal gai police kii lathi
 Lathi also took a modern form
 darasal, kuch saal pehle bent kii bajaay fibre kii lathi bhi chalan main aa gai
 The police started using fiber sticks
 fibre kii lathi bhi bilkul bent jaisi halki or lacheelee hoti he
 Although those who use it say that the fiber sticks are lighter, but the point of cane is something else

 The third song of Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt's film Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania has been released
 'lucky tu lucky main' tital kaa ye gaanaa dance number he
 It is being promoted like a party song and the song lyrics are also slightly different
 is gane main varun dhawan ek baar phir apni daancing skill dikhaate najar aa rahe hai, vahiin aalia bhatta stylish luk main najar aa rahi hai
 The song 'lucky Tu Lucky Main' has been sung by Beni Dayal and Anushka Manchanda

 We hope that this song of the film too becomes a chart buster like 'saturday Saturday' and 'main Tainu Sehwan'

 One such video is viral on social media these days
 is video ke jariye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki jis shaks ko dauda dauda kar bheed peet rahi he wo rajasthan ke dausa se bijepi vidhayak shankar laal sharma hai
 The caption accompanying the video states that "public hands on BJP MLA Shankar Lal Sharma of Rajasthan Dausa have been cleaned, run-and-beaten!" -good days have started
 "kya video main dikh rahe shaks vaaki dausa se bijepi vidhayak shankar laal sharma hai? kya dausa ke vidhayak se kshetra ke log sach main itane naaraaz hai? maamle kii tah tak pahunchane ke liye india today kii viral test team ne isaki padtaal karne kaa faisla kiya
 In this 30-second video, it can be seen that the mob is beating the elderly man dressed in white clothes with sticks and the man is running away to save himself! The video received hundreds of responses
 saath hi badi sankhya main ise dekha gaya
 Watch: Viral video of beating in broad daylight attack
 Angry mob attacked BJP MLA in his area in broad daylight? To find out the truth of this, the viral test team first talked to MLA Shankar Lal Sharma from Dausa
 shankar laal sharma ne naaraazgi jataate hue kaha, 'yah meraa video nahin he, mere naam par is video ko april maheene se viral kiya ja rahaa he, main video main maujuud nahin hum
 In this case my party workers have protested by giving a written complaint to the District Collector
 'ab sawaal ye uthaa kiwideomen bijepi vidhayak shankar laal sharma nahin he to vastav main wo shaks koun he jise bheed dauda-dauda kar peet rahi he
 In an attempt to find answers to these questions, the viral test team also tried to find out which location the video belongs to
 padtaal se saaf hua ki video dausa kaa nahin balki rajasthan ke hi shahar gangapore city kaa he
 Actually this video is during Bharat Bandh on 2 April 2018
 us samay asti-essi adhinium main badlaav ko lekar rajasthan samet kai jagahon par pradarshan hue the
 a protest was also held on this day in Gangapurcity
 tab gangaporesity ke purv vidhayak or congress netaa ramkesh meena updraviyon ko samajhane -bujhane ke liye vahaan pahunche the, lekin prardashankariyon ne unki ek nahin suni or ulta unpar par hi hamalaa bol diya tha
 Ramkesh Meena somehow escaped after saving his life
 isi dauraan kisi ne video bana liya
 (former Congress MLA Ramkesh Meena) We also contacted former MLA Ramkesh Meena about this incident, but he did not agree to speak on it
 gangaporesity main india today network ke savandata ne is ghatana kii pushti karte hue bataaya ki video main jis shaks kii pitayee hote dikh rahi he ve congress netaa ramkesh meena hi hai
 On 27 April 2018, a website called First News India
com published the full news about the incident
 viral test se saaf hua ki video main jis shaks ke dausa ke vidhayak shankar laal sharma hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa tha wo sahi nahin he
