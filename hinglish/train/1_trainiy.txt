 The Chief Secretary of the Delhi government has severely accused the Aam Aadmi Party mlas of assault
 is masale par dilli main siyaasi uthapathak bhi joro par he
 Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash has complained to the Delhi Police about the case
 apni shikaayat main unhone ghatana kaa puraa vivaran diya he
 Following the complaint of Anshu Prakash, the police have registered an FIR against AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan and others
 inke khilaaf aapraadhik sajeesh or sarkari karmchaaree ko kaam karne se rokane ke aarope main cese darj hua he

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kaante kaa muqabla hone ja rahaa he
 The ruling party Congress is going to emerge as the single largest party but the number of absolute majority may remain a few seats away
 india today-karvi incits opinian pole ke mutabik trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main jedies kingmekar kii bhoomika nibhaa sakati he
 Know 10 special things related to the poll
 
 
 opinian pole ke das ahm nishkarsh1
 The Congress is emerging as the largest party in Karnataka, but it will still be behind by a dozen seats with the majority figure
 karvi ke anumaan ke mutabik congress ko 224 siton vaali vidhansabha main 90-101 seat milane ja rahi hai
 2
 bijepike 78-86 siton ke saath duusare number par rahane kii sambhaavna he
 This figure is about 30 seats less than the government formation figure in Karnataka
 3
 Deve Gowda's JDS may emerge as a kingmaker in the state
 karvi kaa anumaan he ki jedies karnataka main 34-43 seat hasil kar sakati he
 Both Congress and BJP will need the help of JDS to form the next government
 4
 When asked by supporters of JDS voters which party Gowda should go with in case of hung assembly, the highest 39% voters said that JDS should support Congress
 5
 a look at the vote share indicates a thorn battle in Karnataka
 donon mukhya partiyon ke vot share main sirf 2% kaa antar he
 The margin of error used in the poll is the same
 congress kaa sambhavit vot share 37% he, vahiin bijepi kaa 35% he
 Polls show that the win-loss gap for 49 seats may be very small
 6
 Voters have a good opinion of the work done by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Karnataka
 38% pratibhaagiyon ne mukhyamantri ke kaam ko acha yaa bahut acha mana
 The highest number of voters has given opinion to see Siddaramaiah as the next Chief Minister of the state
 33% votaron ne siddharmaiya ko mukhyamantri ke taur par pehali pasand mana he
 Yeddyurappa of BJP is considered the second choice i
e
 26% of the voters as the first choice for the Chief Minister
 7
 The voters seem to believe that the Congress will benefit from Rahul Gandhi visiting temples
 42% voter maanate hai ki rahul ke mandiron main jane kii vajah se congress kii chunaav main sambhaavnaaen acchhee hongi
 However, a lot will depend on how the Congress maintains a positive atmosphere for itself at the last moment in the thorn battle
 koi bhi manishankar ayyar yaa chhole bhature jaisaa khud ke pair par kulhadi maarane vaala kadam grand old party ke liye bahut nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 8
 bi es yediurppa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke puraane aarope bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe lagate hai
 40% of the participants believed that these old allegations would go against the BJP in the elections
 9
 Siddaramaiah's strategic stakes such as a separate state flag, making Kannada compulsory in schools, giving Lingayat a separate minority religion status, all seem to be electoral gains for the Congress
 10
 The best hope for the BJP is that the Congress lags behind the simple majority needed to form a government in Karnataka and the BJP then forms the government with the JDS
 haalanki jedies ke muslim samarthakon ko aisa lagane laga ki jedies kii ore se bijepi kaa bhi saath diya ja saktaa he to ve chhitak kar congress kii taraf bhi ja sakate hai

 He has commemorated the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Bipin Chandra Pal
 likhaa he ki bipin chandra paal pidiyon ko apane rashtrawaad or krantikari vichaaron se prerit karte rahenge
 If someone was really inspired by revolutionary ideas and started challenging the government, first of all Piyush Goyal would call him a traitor or his supporters would do it
 ek haftaa tak vah kisi mahapurush se prerit nahin hue
 His tweet does not commemorate anyone's birth anniversary or death anniversary

 pashchim bengal main mukhya vipakshi dal marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ne sharada chit fund ghotaalaa maamle main nilambit trinmul congress saansad kunal ghosh kii giraftaar ke samay par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The CPI (M) has claimed that MP Kunal Ghosh was arrested just after taking the name of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the scam
 makapa kii kor cameti ke sadsy mohammad saleem ne bataaya, 'giraftaar kaa samay hi bahut kuch bataa detaa he
 He (kunal) was arrested the next day after Banerjee was named
 ab maamle kii jaanch kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) se karaayaa janaa behad jaruri ho gaya he
 "investigation remains a joke", he further said, "so far the investigation done in this scam by special investigation has become a joke, because so far it has not yielded any results
" kunal na sirf sharada media samooh kaa mukhya kaaryakari adhikari tha balki kuch samay ke liye mukhyamantri sachivalay main bhi ahm pad par rah chukaa he
 For so long neither Banerjee nor the investigating officers tried to know his (kunal) activities
 ab tak usase sirf ek baar poochtacha kii gai
 "kunal'salim, who was arrested after taking the name of Mamta, further said," But as soon as he started saying bad things for the Trinamool Congress, the investigating officers started clamping down on him
 or jaise hi usne mamata banerjee kaa naam liya use giraftaar kar liya gaya
 "my arrest is a conspiracy", while calling his arrest a "conspiracy", Kunal Ghosh said that the police should enlist the help of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and two leaders of her party to find out the truth in the case
 ghosh ne mamata ke alaava 11 duusare logon se madad lene ke liye kaha
 These include Trinamool General Secretary Mukul Roy, Sports Minister Madan Mitra and party MP Suvendu Adhikari
 ghosh fasebuk par daali postaghosh ne fasebuk par daale gaye apane ek post main kaha, ‘jaanch main un logon kii madad lee jaani chahie jo sen (sharada samooh ke maalik sudipt sen) ko jaanate hai or jinhone sharada samooh se pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh madad lee thi yaa duusare tarah se kuch baaten jaanate hai
 He also said that he is not making any allegations against anyone

 He suspected that his wife had an illicit relationship with a non-resident

 Police have recovered the bodies of the accused's wife and son from his car
 saharanpur police ko soochna mili thi ki dehradun haive par gagalhedi thanashetra main ek sandigdh safed car khadi hui he
 When the police went to the scene and saw a dead body of a woman and child in the car

 When he came to his senses, the man told the police that two people had asked him for a lift while coming from Haridwar
 usne unhen car main baitha liya
 Both the young men strangled his wife and child to death
 police ko us yuvak kii kahani par yakeen nahin hua
 Because there was no loot there
 police ko yuvak se baraamad hue kagajaat se pataa chalaa ki vah haryana ke karnal jile main thana butaanaa ke aivala gaanv kaa rahane vaala he
 His name is Vijay
 mritka uski 30 varshiya patni seemaa or 5 saal kaa betaa jashn tha
 After this, Vijay was strictly interrogated by the police, Vijay broke down against the strictness of the police and he told the police the truth
 darasal vijay ko shaq tha ki uski patni seemaa ke kisi gairmard ke sadhvaidh sambandhthe
 And his son Jashn is not his child
 isi shaq main usne donon kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi
 As part of the conspiracy, he took both of them to Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh
 raste main usne donon ko chaay or doodh main neend kii goli milakar pilaai
 So that both of them slept
 iske baad usne car ke andar hi donon kaa galaa retkar unhe maut kii neend sula diya
 According to the accused, he was in the process of locating the bodies somewhere
 lekin saharanpur main police checking dekhakar vah dar gaya or usne apni gaadi jangal kii taraf mode di

 kai baar haadase ke baad yah sawaal man main aata he ki kya is haadase ko taala ja saktaa tha? mujffarnagar train haadase ke baad bhi kai logon ke man main yah khyaal aayaa hoga, lekin kadava sach yah he ki khatauli train haadasa tal hi nahin saktaa tha
 Because not one or two places, but step by step, railway engineers, officers, employees were taking a dip in the Ganges of negligence
 haadase ke baad jaanch ke liye pahunchi joint invastigeshan team kii report ankhen khol dene vaali he
 After reading this report, the heart cannot be comforted even by saying that if it had not happened, it would have survived the accident
 kyonki khatauli ke paas railway kii laaparvaahee kaa aisa jaal buna hua tha, jisamen musafiron kii maut tay thi
 Report of Joint Investigation Team handed over to Aaj Tak
 is report main kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase hue hai
 Along with this, it has also been revealed that how negligence is spent on the track of the train that trains thousands of people
 joint report main daawa kiya gaya he ki haadasa railway line ke kate hone or usamen gap ban jane ke kaaran hua, lekin aisa hone ke peeche jo vajahen bataai gai hai, wo chaunkaane vaali hai
 How the railway maintenance engineers carelessly cut the track where the train filled with passengers has to pass at a speed of more than a hundred kilometers
 jimmedaar afasar isse beparwaah anjaan bane rahete hai, jo railway ke suraksha system kii ek bhayankar chook ko ujagar kar rahi he
 Regardless of the carelessness with which this information is passed, the employees sitting in the control room also ignore in the same careless manner
 iskaa khamiyaja khatauli train haadase kii shakl main he
 The process of repair on the railway track was not carried out
 The report of the Palanjoint Investigation Team indicated that the standard operating procedure that should have been adopted at the time of repair on the railway track was not followed, While this work was associated with risk of life and property
 jaanch ke dauraan marammat ke kaam main lage ek jei mohanlal meena ke bayaan ke mutabik trek par 20 minute kaa block maanga gaya tha, taaki bees minute tak koi tren us trek se na gujarey, lekin control room ne yaa to ise ansuna kar diya yaa phir is blockege kii maang ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Even the red flag was not put on the track, even after this negligence, there could be a tragedy, but the chain of the negligents did not stop
 railway ke nimayon ke mutabik jab bhi trek par koi marammat kii jaati he, to trek par ek binar flag yani laal jhanda lagaaya jaataa he, lekin kaam kar rahe logon ne is niyam kaa bhi paalan nahin kiya
 Had the flag been flagged, the driver of the train would have received the signal and the accident could have been avoided or at least the loss of life and property could have been avoided, but the flag which should have been placed on the track for warning would be Found folded in place of haadase ke liye jimmedaar vibhaag ke senior ejeeniyar jaanch cameti main shamildilachasp baat yah he ki jaanch report main permanent ve (p-way) vibhaag ko haadase ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he or isi vibhaag ke ek senior ejeeniyar haadase kii jagah par jaanch karne pahunchi cameti main bhi shaamil the
 The SSE or Senior Section Engineer of the p-way department was part of this committee, but as soon as the responsibility came to his department, he did not sign his report

 vahiin sapa netaa revati raman singh ne ram mandir ke masale par charchaa main shaamil hone se inkaar karte hue kaha vi ve ganga safai ke mudde par bolne aae hai
 Swami Avimukteshwaranand, representative of Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, who is presiding in the Dharma Parliament, told 'aaj Tak' that all parties have been invited for the Dharma Sansad to express their views on the construction of Ram temple
 swami avimukteshwaranand kaha ki dharm sansad ke jariye yah prastaav tay kiya jayega ki jab tak ram mandir nirmaan kii shuruyaat kii taarikh nahin pataa chalati tab tak sadhu sanyasi is dharm sansad se nahin hatenge

 The Sadhu Sannyasins who came to Prayagraj for Ardh Kumbh have already expressed their displeasure with the Modi government and now the patience of the Sadhus is also breaking for the construction of Ram temple
 aise main ram mandir ke mudde par do-do dharm sansad se prayagraj main kumbh kaa maahaul garmane ke asaar hai

 us din bhi varun chup rahe
 He met all the top BJP leaders in Delhi as well, and everyone would have said that Varun will stay on the affidavit, because parole does not mean getting rid of NSA

 Amidst all this, today is an important day in Pilibhit

 " pradhanmantri narendra modi kebulate trindream project ko bada jhatka lagane kii khabar ke bich kendra sarkaar kii taraf se safai di gai he ki bullate train pariyojna ke liye funding rokane kaa koi faislajapaanne nahin liya he
 This cleanliness is a joint venture company of the state governments, including the central government, which has been given the responsibility of the bullet train project
 ek pramukh angreji akhbaar ne daawa kiya tha ki bullate train project kii funding karne vaali japani company japan international kooparation agency (jika) ne bullate trail network ke liye fundig ko roak diya he
 According to the report, the Japanese company has told the Modi government that before proceeding on this project, it needs to first look into the problem of farmers in the country
 ek lakh karod rupee kii laagat vaali bullate train yojana ke nirmaan main gujarat or maharashtra ke kisaanon se jameen adhigrahan kaa maamla vivaadon main pad rahaa he
 In view of this controversy, while the Central Government has set up a special committee, the Japanese company has withheld funds and said that the Modi government first needs to deal with the problem of farmers
 'jika japan sarkaar kii agency he or vah japan sarkaar ke liye antarrashtriya str par saamaajik-aarthik nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karti he
 National high-speed rail Corporation Limited (NHRCL) has got the responsibility of bullet trail project in India
 philhal bharat sarkaar kii is agency ko bullate train project ke liye gujarat or maharashtra main kisaanon se jameen adhigrahan karne main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa rahaa he
 The last monsoon rains will collapse before the 2019 elections
 Economy: Both the states involved in the Butel train project, farmers in Gujarat and Maharashtra are demanding more compensation for their land
 is muaavje ke alaava donon rajyon main kisaanon ne jameen dene ke liye shart rakhi he ki sarkaar in ilaakon main saamaanya suvidhaon ke saath-saath saajha talab, skool, solar lite samet gaanv str par hospital or doctor kii vyavastha bhi sunishchit kare
 After this report, the government company has claimed that such reports published in the media are false
 sarkaar ke mutabik is tarah kaa koi faisla jika ne nahin liya he
 At the same time, the government company claimed that a loan agreement of 10 billion yen has been made between Government of India and Zika and no funds are pending for the project from Zika till now
 vahiin kisaanon kii samasya par kaha he ki company is project se prabhavit hone vaale kisaanon kii samasya se waakif he or prabhavit hone vaale kisaanon kii puri jimmedaari company kii he
 The last bet of the monsoon is not to be taken away; it is raining votes for the Modi government that in the 508 km bullet train project, about 110 km of the road passes through Palghar in Maharashtra and the central government faces a tough challenge in taking land from the farmers here

 vahiin gujarat main bhi sarkaar ko lagbhag 85da hectare jameen kaa adhigrahan aath jilon main faile 5000 kisaan pariwaron se karnaa he
 While the Bullet Train Project is the central government's dream project, the Japanese agency funding it has so far released just Rs 125 crore
 bharat or japan ke bich hue samjhaute ke mutabik is project ko 2022 tak puraa karne ke liye japan ko lagbhag 80,000 karod rupee kaa nivesh karnaa he jabaki bachaa hua 20,000 rupee kendra sarkaar yojana main lagaaegi
 Now, following Japan's decision to stop funding, the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Finance are lacking options to complete the project on time

 supreme court kechif justise ties thakur ke anurodhako sweekaar karte hue elahabaad hoicourt ke 68 jajon ne garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main bhi mukademon kii sunwaayee karne kii sahmati de di he
 The Allahabad High Court is the first High Court in the country to do so
 chif justise divai chandrachud kii pahal par hoicourt ke 68 jajon ne ab tak garmi kii chhuttiyon main bhi nyaayik kaary karne kii sahmati di he
 The meeting was decided, according to a letter issued by the High Court Registrar General SK Singh, Chief Justice DY Chandrachud has also taken consent from senior members of the High Court Bar Association and senior judges for judicial work during summer vacation
 baar ke padaadhikariyon va senior jajon ke saath is sambandh main chif justise kii meeting main nirnay liya gaya he ki garmi kii chuttee ke dauraan jail apilon, jisamen jelon main sajaa kaat rahe apradhi or sarkaar dwaara daayar criminal apilon kii sunwaayee, jaj variyata ke aadhaar par karenge
 Criminal appeals will not be heard, some courts will also hear old criminal appeals
 in sabhi mukademon ko notiphoi kar diya jaayegaa jisase vakil apni sahmati de saken
 There is a holiday from June 1 to June 30, it is worth mentioning that the High Court judges have left their summer holidays for the first time
 hoicourt main prativarsh garmi kii chuttee ek june se 30 june ke bich hoti he
 During this time only the necessary cases are heard
 lekin is baar garmi kii chhuttiyon main court kaam karegaa or jail main sajaa kaat rahe aparaadhiyon kii apilon par vishesh rup se sunwaayee bhi kii jaaegi
 There are 9 lakh cases pending in the High Court
 At present, the Allahabad High Court of Asia has about 9 lakh cases pending
 do varsh pehle pending mukademon kii sankhya 11 lakh thi
 In these two years three and a half lakh new cases were also filed
 jajon kii kam sankhya ke baavjood hoicourt main is dauraan lagbhag saadhe paanch lakh mukademon kaa nistaaran kiya gaya
 Now the new initiative has increased the possibility of reducing this burden
 desh main chunavi bigul bajte hi kolkata ke malik ghat flower market or dilli ke gajipur phool mandi main aavak main bada ijapha dekhne ko miltaa he
 When it comes to Deepawali, breathing in both these markets also proves to be a loss for businessmen
 malik ghat market asia kaa sabase bada flower market he or gajipur mandi desh kii sabase badi khapat market
 This is the reason why such a huge increase in the demand for flowers is seen during the elections
 kyon khaas he ye vaali deepavalidilli main is saal deepawali khaas he
 There is a ban on selling firecrackers following the order of the Supreme Court
 lihaaja is saal sef deepawali ke saath-saath pradooshan mukt deepawali kaa bhi naaraa lag rahaa he
 On the night of Chhoti Deepawali and Big Diwali, firecrackers will be seen bursting into the sky this year
 pichley saal kii tarah deepawali kii subah bacchon-buudhon ko saans lene main dikkat ke chalate aspataal main admit nahin hona padegaa
 Will the demand for flowers increase? Flowers and decorative items are expected to remain strong in Delhi this Diwali due to the firecrackers disappearing from the market
 deepawali ke liye nakli phool (kaagaj or plastic se bane) to beete ek maheene se bik rahe hai
 This Diwali is also special for businessmen in Ghazipur mandi who are supplying wholesale of genuine flowers
 pataakhon par lagi pabandi se unhen bhi cell main ijaphe kii aas he lihaaja taiyaari puri he ki is baar do din ke kaarobaar main vah zyada se zyada cell kar len
 For this, almost all the traders have ordered 5 times more flowers than their mangoes
 ise bhi padhein: kaam nahin aayega chini pataakhe-ladiyon kaa 'rashtravaadi' bahishkaar5 guna daam par bikega phool?gajipur mandi main kaarobaar kaa sidhaa niyam chalata he
 Here the flower supply is fixed
 demand main utaar-chadhaav adhik he or sabase bada risk ki kuch ghanton main phool nahin bika to unke saamne padaa 100 rupee kaa ek videshi phool (thailand se aayaa) bhi murjhaa jayega
 Therefore, as the demand for flowers increases in the market, prices start to increase automatically
 gajipur phool mandi main aamtaur par alag-alag phulon ke ye daam rahete hai
 Marigold: Rs 120-150 per kilogram flower: 250-400 per kilogram flower Read: This Diwali will be made in India, due to this, the sale of Chinese goods will be reduced in the retail market by 5 times the higher price
 Let's say, but the question is, what is the cost of these flowers in the retail market? The common man does his shopping from the retail market
 yahaan par alag-alag phool kis keemat par bikate hai usee se is deepawali phulon ke kaarobaar kaa sahi akalan hoga
 On the occasion of Deepawali last year, where the flower of rhinoceros was sold at Rs 250-350 per kg in Ghazipur market, the price of this flower reached Rs 500-600 per kg in the retail market

 It did not feel good to do the same kind of work

 hotel sanchaalak ne ab cameraa number 105 kii saaj sajja puri tarah badal di he
 Here is the details of how long he stayed in this room with the photo of Kovind
 customers bhi kamare main thaharne par ek alag se sukhad anubhav kii baat kehete hai

 do teen hotel dikhe
 i liked the hotel garden view by the room
 maine raat ko yahaan aakar check in kiya to mujhe nahin pataa tha ki kis kamare main jane vaala hum
 In the room i went and saw that there was a picture of the honorable President Kovindka
 unhone 14 disambar 2013 ko ek raat ke liye yahaan ste kiya tha
 “meraj Ahmed, based in Dubai, narrated a similar experience
 meraaj ke mutabik reference se unhen garden vyuu hotel memrashtrapati kovindke naam par suit kaa pataa chalaa
 The best aspect of this hotel operator's initiative is that whatever proceeds from the suite will be sent to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund, which will be of use to the needy

 Jaitley said that in the last 48 hours and since the Indian Meteorological Department has declared forecasts for the lack of monsoon, conclusions are being made in an exaggerated manner, hence it was necessary to express the views of the Finance Ministry on this subject
 share bazaar main pichley teen din se jari giravat ko rujhaan maanane se inkaar karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha ki visheshtaur par apratyaksh karon kaa rajasav sangrah - ek mukhya sanketak ne prabhavi oochaal dikhaaya he
 Jaitley expressed confidence that the forecast of weak monsoon in the northwest region would not affect food production
 unhone kaha ki yah kshetra sinchai suvidhaon se yukt he jabaki desh ke duusare kshetron main monsoon saamaanya rahegaa
 Apart from this, there is a lot of food grains in the country to deal with any emergency
 jetali ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘is bare main jis tarah kii atakalein ham dekh rahe hai or jis tarah ke badhaachadhaakar kiye gayi vishleshan hamen padhane ko mil rahe hai vah upyukt nahin hai
 What is right in this regard is that it will have a significant impact on the Indian economy
 ’ jetali ne kaha ki is sambandh main jo baat prasangik he vah he monsoon kaa bhaugalik aadhaar par vitaran or varsha kaa samay
 On Tuesday, the Indian Meteorological Department, while forecasting the monsoon, said that the monsoon would be 88 percent in terms of long-term average

 After the Meteorological Department's prediction about the monsoon, Jaitley called a meeting of senior scientists of the Meteorological Department on Wednesday and conducted a detailed analysis of the forecast with them
 jetali ne kaha, ‘unke agrim anumaan ke mutabik ham dakshin, madhya or uttar purvi kshetra main kaaphi kuch saamaanya ke kareeb honge
 Which will be a bit lacking, if it happens, it will be in the northwest region and a large area in the northwest is irrigated
 ’ The Finance Minister said, "even assuming the forecasts of the Meteorological Department are correct, it will not have much impact on the production of food grains, given the geographical distribution of rainfall

 The World Cup-1983 win can be called a milestone in terms of Indian cricket
 mahaan harfanmaulaa kapil dev ke netritv main prudential worldcup ke liye bhartiya team jab england pahunchi thi to use vijeta banane kaa to thik, semifinal main pahunchane tak kaa daavedaar bhi nahin mana ja rahaa tha
 The reason behind this was the performance of Team India in the World Cup in 1975 and 1979
 1975 ke worldcup main bhartiya team mahaj purvi africa ko parajeet kar pai thi
 England then won the Indian team by a margin of over 200 runs
 is match main england kii team ne 60 over main 334 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha
 The same story of Team India continued almost even during the 1979 World Cup and they had to face defeat against the deemed Sri Lanka
 baharhaal, bhartiya team ne yah tamaam kasar 1983 ke worldcup main puri karte hue itihaas rach diya
 Kapildev's jambajas captured the winning trophy after Team India defeated West Indies in the final
 is pradarshan main team ke lagbhag har khilaadi ne kuch na kuch yogadan diya, lekin ek khilaadi aisa tha jo behad pratibhavan hone ke baavjood worldcup main koi match nahin khel sakaa
 Many people may not even remember that the Indian team, led by Kapil Dev, was also the fast bowler Sunil Walson
 walsan ko worldcup main koi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila
 If this thing were to happen here, it would be fine
 valsan iske baad bharat kii ore se koi international match bhi nahin khel paae
 Despite being a member of the World Cup winning team, there is not a single international match recorded in their account
 tippaniyan Many former players considered Sunil Walson a cricketer of talent
 gharelu cricket main dilli or railway kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale valsan baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj the
 25 in 75 first-class matches
 35 ke ausat se 212 wicket unke naam par darj hai
 Six times he took five or more and once more than 10 wickets
 gharelu cricket muqablon main unhone duniya ke mahaan openar sunil gavaskar ko out kiya
 Everyone knows how hard Sunny used to get the bowlers for their wickets and dismissing them cannot be an ordinary bowler
 valsan baayen haath ke gendbaaj the
 India have had very few left-arm bowlers since the 80s or earlier
 karsan ghavri ke baad bhartiya team main lambey samay tak koi baayen haath kaa gendbaaj nahin rahaa
 In this sense, Walson could prove to be of use to the team, but unfortunately he did not get a chance to play a single international match
 iske peeche kaaran varsh 1975 or 1979 ke worldcup main team india kaa pradarshan tha
 In the 1975 World Cup, the Indian team could only defeat East Africa
 england ne us samay bhartiya team par 200 ran se adhik ke antar se jeet hasil kii thi
 In this match, England's team scored a huge score of 334 runs in 60 overs
 1979 ke worldcup ke dauraan bhi team india kii yahi kahani lagbhag jari rahi or kamjor maani ja rahi srilanka ke khilaaf bhi use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, the Indian team created history by completing all this cancer in the 1983 World Cup
 kapildev ke jambaajon ne final main team india ne westeindies ko haraakar vijeta trophy kar kabja jamaaya
 Almost every player in the team contributed something to this performance, but there was one player who, despite being very talented, could not play a match in the World Cup
 kai logon ko to shaayad yaad bhi nahin hoga ki kapil dev ke netritv main worldcup champion bani bhartiya team main tej gendbaaj sunil valsan bhi the
 Walson did not get a chance to play any match in the World Cup
 baat yaheen tak hoti to thik he
 Walson could not play any international match for India after this
 worldcup vijeta team ke sadsy hone ke baavjood unke khate main ek bhi interneshal match darj nahin he
 The comments kai purv khilaadi, sunil valsan ko pratibha se bharpoor cricketer maanate the
 Walson was a left-arm fast bowler representing Delhi and Railways in domestic cricket
 75 pratham shrenee ke maichon main 25
 212 wickets at an average of 35 are recorded in his name
 chah baar unhone paanch yaa isse adhik or ek baar 10 se adhik wicket hasil kiye
 In the domestic cricket matches, he dismissed the world's greatest opener Sunil Gavaskar
 har koi jaanata he ki sani apane wicket ke liye gendbaajon se kitni mehnat karaate the or unhen out karne kaa kaam koi saadhaaran gendbaaj nahin ho saktaa
 Walson was a left-arm bowler
 80 ke dashak yaa isse pehle bharat ke paas baayen haath ke gendbaaj bahut kam hue hai
 After Karsan Ghavri, there was no left-arm bowler in the Indian team for a long time
 is lihaaj se valsan team ke liye upyog sabit ho sakate the, lekin durbhaagya se unhen ek bhi international match khilne kaa mauka nahin mil paaya

 Where are they today and where is Ayodhya ?? marxvaadi itihaaskaar swa
 Kishore Kunal, a student of Ram Sharan Sharma, says that there has been a lot of loss of history in this dispute
 vah is zahreele vivaad se ayodhya ke itihaas ko bachaana chaahate hai
 According to him, Marxist historians also did not keep the correct evidence and did not interpret it correctly
 baaki mandir samarthakon ne to kair itihaas ko itihaas hi nahin samajha
 Claimed to make false facts historical
 'main pichley do dashakon se aitihaasik tathyon kii juthi or bhraamak vyakhya ke kaaran ayodhya ke vaastavik itihaas kii maut kaa mook darshak bana hua hum
 In the early nineties, as a negotiator between the Hindu and Muslim communities, i did my duty with integrity, but in the last stages of the hearing in the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court, i felt that the Ayodhya dispute should interfere and i Prepared this thesis
 ' Kishore Kunal has told in his book how historians of Vishwa Hindu Parishad tried to make Bahadur Shahi the written book of the anonymous daughter of Bahadur Shah Alamgir
 jabaki aurangzeb ke bete bahadur shah ko kabhi alamgir kaa kitaab hi nahin mila
 Bahadur Shah had a daughter who had died long ago
 mirza jaan is kitaab ke bare main daawa karata he ki usne is kitaab ke kuch ansh suleman shikoh ke bete kii librari main rakhi ek kitaab se liye hai
 Kunal claims that Suleiman Shikoh had no son
 mirza jaan ne 1855 main ek kitaab likhi he wo itani bhadakaau thi ki use british hukumat ne pratibandhit kar diya tha
 Kunal equally exposes the upsets of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Marxist historians
 unhone bataaya he ki marxvaadi itihaaskaaron kaa daawa galat tha ki dasharath jataka main ram sita ko bhai bahan bataaya gaya he
 Kunal maintains that Rama is remembered with reverence in the early Buddhist text
 kahin anadar nahin hua he
 He says that a careful study of the saga part of the Jataka tales proves that there is nothing objectionable about Rama
 unhone bi en pandey ke kuch daavon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Kunal has criticized Marxist historians as established historians who did not accept any claims of disagreement or truth
 kunal ne vishwa hindu parishad ke samarthak itihaaskaaron ke bare main tippanee karte hue kaha he ki 'main inhen rashtravaadi yaa rudhiwaadi itihaaskaar kii jagah utsaahi itihaaskaar kahana pasand karata hum
 By the way, Karl Marx is also mentioned in this book and that too in a good context! kunal bataate hai ki somnath main mandir todane or lut paat ke baad bhi vahaan ke shaiva pashupatacharya ne masjid kaa nirmaan karavaaya balki aas paas dukaane bhi banavaain taaki vyapaar or haj ke liye jane vaale musalamaanon ko dikkat na ho
 At the same time, he says that it will be difficult for many readers to accept that in 1949 Baba Abhiramdasji, who kept the idol of Ram Lala in the deserted mosque, donated 50 acres of land in 1955 by Qayam Kidwai, a Muslim zamindar of Barabanki
 kunal bataate hai ki in vivaadon se sthaneey str par donon samudaayon main duuri nahin badi
 They did not become isolated from each other
 'logon ko jaanakar hairaani hogi ki tathakthith babari masjid kaa 240 saal tak kisi bhi text yani kitaab main zikr nahin aata he
 Kunal repeatedly calls the so-called Babri Masjid, which has been tamed in our political consciousness by the name of Babri Masjid and in the name of which many people killed each other
 kunal ke paas tamaam dastauez hai jinka yahaan zikr karnaa mumkin nahin he

 Babur of Kunal's book was not a fanatic

 ayoghya ke itihaas ko bachaane or babar ko nirdosh bataane main kunal ne apni zindagi ke kai saal abhilekhagaaron main laga diye lekin saakshyon ko todane marodane vaali raajnneeti is sanatani ramandi itihaaskaar kii kitaab ko kaise sweekaar karegi
 While reading this book, i am thinking that according to Kunal Babur did not break the temple, it was not Babri Masjid, but the people who demolished the history of Ayodhya, who were they but who are they
 ve aaj kahaan hai or ayodhya kahaan he?? Someone associated with the temple construction section said that Babur was innocent
 uske khilaaf us aparaadh ke liye dashakon tak nafrat failaai gai jo usne kii hi nahin' koi maamuli baat nahin he
 Kunal Babar is called a liberal and a fearless warrior
 ham aap jaanate hai ki maujuuda raajnneeti main babar kaa naam lete hi kis kis tarah kii baaten zahan main ubhar aati hai
 Will they be able to digest these claims of the organization and leader Kunal, who did countless provocative arguments calling 'babri ki Auladon'? No water has been shed before and after the demolition of Babri Masjid
 kunal ne ayodhya kaa bada hi dilachasp itihaas likhaa he
 Worth a read
 kunal ke ayodhya main sirf ram nahin hai, rahim bhi hai
 In saving Ayoghya's history and declaring Babur as innocent, Kunal spent many years of his life in the archives, but how will the politics of witnessing the evidence accept the book of this Sanatani Ramanandi historian

 Where are they today and where is Ayodhya ?? kunal ne ayodhya kaa bada hi dilachasp itihaas likhaa he

 So in the evening, film star Sunny Deol is seen campaigning for Rita Bahuguna Joshi

 Due to this, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who came from Congress to BJP on this VVIP seat in Allahabad, has been called from Lucknow to Allahabad to contest elections, but the path from Allahabad to Parliament House is not so easy for Rita Bahuguna

 Inside the Kothi, many old photos of Hemwanti Nandan Bahuguna along with many new photos of Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have also been installed

 wo kehete hai ki vyaktigat taur par reeta bahuguna joshi ke chunaav prachaar ke liye aae hai, jabaki dil se wo congressi hai
 Rita Bahuguna herself has been in Congress for 24 years
 
 
 lekin ab bijepi ummidavaar banakar elahabaad lauti hai
 
 bijepi kii pratyaashee reeta bahuguna joshi kahati hai ki congress kshetreey netaaon ko aage badhane nahin detii he isi vajah se uskaa janaadhar lagaataar kam hua he

 ab bijepi main 25 saal se rahe yogesh shukla congress ke tikat se 24 saal congress main rahane vaali bijepi ummidavaar reeta bahuguna ko takkar de rahe hai
 Congress candidate Yogesh Shukla says that if we have five percent of the vote then why is the BJP nervous
 
 Why does the Prime Minister have to hold a rally in Allahabad again? Pravin Singh, who has been doing journalism in Allahabad for a long time, says it is not easy for Rita Bahuguna to win this seat
 elahabaad ne desh ko paanch pradhanmantri die, lekin ab bijepi or gathbandhan ke diggajon ke chunavi maidan main hone se muqabla dilachasp he

 India's economy could be $ 1 trillion in 55 years, we added $ 1 trillion to its size in 5 years

 According to World Bank data, in 1964, the size of the world economy was 1
 8 trillian tha

 29 trillian dollar tha
 Between 2014 and 2019, the size of the world economy has grown by some 9 trillion

 sarkaar kahati he ki agar paanch saal main 8 pratishat hi jidipi vruddhi dar rahe to lakshya hasil kar sakati he
 The answer is from Slogan
 aashaa, vishwaas or akanjha se
 Why are we adding to the size of the economy, is this the best and accepted concept? Per capita income
 2018 main prati vyakti aay ke maamle main bharat duniya ke 187 deshon main 147wein number par tha

 yahaan bijepi ne andekhi kii thi kyonki 1993 ke chunaav main santon ne prachaar nahin kiya or car seva ke baad babari masjid kaa gumbad giraane vaali lahar main bhi vah haar gai
 When the NDA government was formed at the Center, the VHP suffered more humiliation than the non-bjp governments
 uski saakh ko sabase adhik chot tehri baandh ke khilaaf andolan ne pahunchaai
 At that time, leaders like Sinhala and Giriraj Kishore had threatened water tomb, but they had to retreat later
 sinhal ke dabaav main vaajapeyi sarkaar ne murali manohar joshi kii adhyakshata main ek cameti bana di jinhone tehri baandh ko hari jhandi dikhaai or pipe ke jariye chode gaye pani ko hi vihip ne aviral ganga maan liya
 After the completion of two months of the new government's quest to gain new energy, Sinhal analyzed the 2014 general election in such a way, "those in India whom the secularists speak of wanted to run Muslims against Hindu society and run politics
" lekin musalamaanon ko pehali baar samaj aa gaya he ki unki shakti ke bina bhi desh main sarkaar ban sakati he
 "this statement reflects the vhp's thinking that without aggression its organization cannot get an edge
" lihaaja vah apane vichaardhaara vaali sarkaar hone kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 But the way she is taking advantage of the Modi government creates an atmosphere of communal tension
 baharhaal, modi karodon berozegaron ko rojgaar ke avasar muhaiyaa karakar behatar jindagi dene ke liye patibaddh hai
 That is, the agenda of VHP and Modi does not match
 aise main vah jahaan apni sarkaar kii vajah se duvidha main he, vahiin modi sarkaar ko raashtra dharm nibhaana he
 But whenever it seems that Modi is starting to implement vhp's agenda, then suppose that the situation is getting out of his control

 If sources are to be believed, they have also prepared a road map for cleaning the Ganges
 ganga ko sabase adhik ganda karne vaale shaharon main kolkata, varanasi, kanpur, elahabaad, patna, haavda, haridwar or bhagalpur shaamil he
 These 10 cities are responsible for 70% pollution in the Ganges
 nitin gadakari ne agle teen maheene main un 10 shaharon menganga nadi kii safaika kaam shuru karne kaa ultimatum diya he
 Where the river Ganges is the most polluted
 jahaan se sabase zyada gandagi ganga main chodi jaati he
 The focus will be on setting up sewage treatment plants

 Along with this, necessary instructions will be given on the spot itself
 gauratlab he ki kanpur main chamade kii kai factriyaan hai
 The chemical and dirty water coming out of them falls into the river
 jis anupaat main kanpur main ganga nadi pradooshit hoti he
 In that proportion there is no treatment plant to clean the dirty clean water
 agle teen maheene main kanpur main treetment plant lagaaya jaayegaa
 Tender for this plant will be released next week
 sheeshaamau kanpur kaa sabase bada naala he
 Millions of liters of dirty water falls into the Ganges River
 kanpur kii puri gandagi ko yahi naala laakar ganga nadi main milaataa he
 For this, the dirty water of this drain did not fall in the Ganges, so that the Ministry has ordered the UP government to start the work of diverting the drain with immediate effect
 gauratlab he ki mantralay kii jimmedaari sambhalate hi nitin gadakari ne neshnal sports stadium main adhikariyon ke saath pehali hi baithak menmaami gange pariyojnaki samiksha kii

 He also clearly told the officials that he likes to work and he likes working people

 Every resident of Kasganj is praying that this city should never see anyone's evil eyes

 Officers are keeping vigil in the field and keep an eye on every situation
 rapid ection force kii tukadiyaan ab bhi shahar ke kone kone main flag march kar rahi he
 The effort of the administration is that none of the unruly elements get a chance to commit any crime in the city
 ‘aaj tak’ nekasganjamen jagah-jagah ja kar logon se unke dil kii baat jaanane kii koshish kii
 Wanted to know whether Kasganj would again become Kasganj of Amir Khusro and Tulsidas? Will the message of Ganga Jamuni Tehzeeb be able to return to the country from here? 'aaj Tak' reporter reviewed the three places in Kasganj where the incident which started on Republic Day turned into a violent confrontation and shot dead Chandan Gupta Gaya, along with Naushad was injured in the leg
 ghatana ke ek hafte baad ‘aaj tak’ ne sabase pehle baradvari ilaake kaa rukh kiya
 It was from here on January 26 that Chandan Gupta and his companions left Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai shouting slogans
 baradvari ke logon ko ummid he ki halaat jaldi hi thik ho jaaenge
 Naval, who runs a shop in this area, says that the situation is slowly recovering and it is expected that soon everything will be the same
 26 janvari ko kasganj main jo dukhad ghatnakram hua, uski duusari kadi tha badunagar kaa ilaaka
 There was a ruckus at Veer Abdul Hameed Chowk located here after allegedly provoking slogans
 police ne beete hafte main badunagar main chhapemari ke baad 6 ladakon ko hiraasat main liya
 a week after the incident, 'aaj Tak' reached Veer Abdul Hameed Chowk, where policemen were seen guarding the bayonets at the mouth of the streets
 dukandaar saamaanya dinon kii tarah kaam dhandhe main lage the to sadak par bachche bhi akele aate-jate dikhe
 The people in Badunagar used to say that the situation has now recovered and peace has returned
 badunagar main muslim samudaay ke log badi sankhya main rahete hai
 There were also allegations about the 26 January incident that slogans were raised in support of Pakistan here
 is tarah ke aaropon ko lekar ‘aaj tak’ ne vir abdul hamid chowk par khadey muslim samudaay ke logon se baat kii
 These things are important in what he said
 1
 "if both Hindus and Muslims want, the bitterness between them will end
 ”2
 "we want to take the initiative
 agar hindu bhai 15 agast ko tirangaa yatra nikaalnaa chaahate hai to ham unke saath hai
 We want them to take Muslims along with them
 ‘pakistan murdaabaad’ ke naare lagaae jaaen to ham unase pehle or unase aage jaakar aisa karenge
 'pakistan was Murdabad' and always will be
 ”3
 “muslims bow their heads before Allah only
 vande maataram kaa matlab dharti ke aage jhukna he isliye ham dharti ke aage nahin jhuk sakate
 But we say 'hindustan Zindabad' and also 'jai Hind'
 ham bhi gaate hai- ‘saare jahaan se acha hindustan hamaara
 'we will speak this on the chest of Pakistan
 saath hi hajaar dfa bolenge- pakistan murdaabaad
 "4
 "pakistan se hamaara koi vaasta nahin
 We were born and raised in India, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians all fought together in the freedom struggle and drove the British away from here
 bharat ham sabhi kaa desh he
 "5
 yahaan pakistan ke samarthan main koi naare nahin lage the
 If someone is blaming us like that, then it is absolutely wrong
 badunagar se har insaan sena main bhartee hona chahta he or bataanaa chahta he ki use hindustan se kitna pyaar he
 Those who were talked to in Badunagar also raised the question that most of the poor laborers live here
 unhen har din do june roti jutaney kii hi chintaa rahati he, wo kya danga fasaad karenge
 After Badunagar, the third episode of 'aaj Tak' incident reached Sut Mandi
 kasganj ke dm aar pi singh ke bayaan ke mutabik tirangaa yatra roke jane se naaraaz yuva badale kii bhaavana se haathon main jhande or danda liye yaheen pahunche the
 The house of the accused named in the murder of Chandan Gupta - Salim, Wasim and Naseem is located near Sut Mandi
 inamen se saleem ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 According to the DM of Kasganj, Chandan Gupta was shot on the roof
 saamne aae sisitivi footage main bhi kahani kuch aisi hi dikhaai detii he
 From where the video of the third episode of the incident was made, 'aaj Tak' also reached there
 soot mandi colectrate ke paas sthit is imaarat kii chat se hi video banaaya gaya
 However, the situation now looked completely normal in Sut Mandi
 kasganj main kya hindu, kya musalmaan, har koi yahi chahta he ki shahar main aman-chaiyn hameshaa bana rahe
 At the same time, the poison of politics should be kept away from here, which wants to divide the human being with the man for his benefit

 According to him, 'at first they did not consider me less than a celebrity, but now consider them as their own

 Villagers living in Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh allege that Essar Power M

 (EPMPL) in a coal power plant has destroyed all fields in the surrounding four kilometers of the area due to the breakdown of poisonous residues, that is, artificial ponds built to collect ash

 V
 es
 Chaudhary told, “five children were trapped in a house
 
 
 hamane unhen aadhi raat ke aasapaas bachaaya
 
 
 "in one photograph a layer of white ash can be seen on the ends, faces and chests of all five children
 singrauli, jiskaa kuch hissaa uttar pradesh ke sonbhadra jile main aata he, main 10 koyala aadhaarit power plant hai, jinaki kul kshamta desh ke kisi bhi ilaake main sabase zyaada 21,000 megawatt he
 According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), these power plants have made Singrauli the second most polluted industrial area in the country after Ghaziabad
 EPMPL ne ek bayaan main kaha ki raakh ke talab kaa tootna buudhvaar raat kii ghatana he, or aarope lagaaya ki yah 'saaf-saaf jaanboojhkar kii gai vaardaat' (sabotaj yaa Sabotage) he
 Mr
 Chaudhary told, “about 500 farmers have been affected by the leaking of ash
 
 
 hamane shuruaati jaanch kii maang kii he, jo company kii ore se jari bayaan samet sabhi pahaluon kii padtaal karegi
 
 
 "the collector also informed that state and central pollution control officials are collecting samples
 graminon dwaara mobile phonon ke zariye khinchi gai tasveeron or banaae gaye video main power plant ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main gaad kii baadh ko dekha ja saktaa he, jisamen khetihar zaminein bhi shaamil hai
 This artificial pond is used to deposit the ash that is produced in the coal-fired power plant along with the original product
 koyale kii yah raakh behad hanikaarak hoti he, jisamen arsenic samet kai zahreele padaarth hote hai
 Scientists and social workers say that the leaking of ash around the power plants in such a way can cause the water inside the ground to become very poisonous, and it will have a bad effect on health
 sarkaar tathaa pradooshan niyantran ke niyamon ke anusaar, raakh ke talabon ke chaaron or kancreet kii diwaar banaai jaani chahie, or niyam yah bhi kehete hai ki raakh ke talabon ko kshamta se zyaada istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Activist Jagat Narayan Vishwakarma, who has petitioned the National Green Tribunal (national Green Tribunal or NGT) over pollution in Singrauli, said, "in some areas the ash has accumulated up to six-six feet height
 
 
 do gaanv prabhavit hue hai
 
 
 The ash leaked as the wall of the ash pond broke
 
 
 in deevaaron ko mitti, eenton or kancreet se banaaya janaa chahie, lekin yahaan ye deevaaren raakh se hi banaai gai thim
 
 
 "he said," This is not right
 
 
 yah isse pehle bhi ilaake ke anya power planton main ho chukaa he, lekin kisi ko parvaah hi nahin he
 
 
 "essar Energy said in a statement that the collapse of the pond is a 'deliberate act'
" bayaan main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki is 'sharaarat' ke liye gramin zimmedaar hai
 The company said in a statement released on its website, "our security personnel posted in the plant have given a statement to the local police that they saw four-five unidentified people running away from the scene on the night of the incident
 
 
 hamane 'jaanboojhkar kii gai harakat' kaa aarope lagaate hue FIR darj kiye jane kii arzi de di he, or sthaneey adhikariyon ko bhi ghatana ke bare main jaankaree de di he
 
 
 "the company says that the land on which the ashes have fallen is a non-agricultural land owned by EPMPL
 company ne kaha, "darasal, is zamin par ve parivaar kabza karne waalon ke rup main apni marzi se rahete aa rahe hai, jabaki company baar-baar unase ise khaali karne ke liye kahati rahi he

 The answer is very simple

 Looking at the trailer, it seems that Love Story is The Lunch Box
 magar ye usase kahin aage badhkar khud ko nae sire se samajhane, beete vakt ke andhere main ghire jaalon ko saaf karne or ek nae safar kaa hausala kaayam karne kii kahani he

 sab kuch bhaany bhaany karata hua sa, magar khokhla kar dene vaali chuppi ke saath
 Then one day a lunch box comes to him
 wo kisi or kaa he
 It is not a lunch box, it is an invisible bridge
 ye pul insaanon kaa vajan nahin sah saktaa, magar unke khyaalon ko bakhubi is kone se us kone le jaataa he
 There is an eye, which sniffs, scolds, appreciates and eats dishes placed in glasses and lunch boxes
 udhar pul ke duusare chor par he ek aurat
 Ila (nimrat Kaur) is her name

 Who just comes from office and takes a metropolitan kind of coolness from his wife

 During this journey there is a world between these two and wearing the badge of that world fills the presence of Sheikh (nawazuddin)

 There is a bit of tension, which makes the person who sees this story their royalty
 aap ise dekh rahe hai or is kram main donon kirdaaron ke raajadaar ho rahe hai
 Then without telling yourself, you want to tell these characters something in your own way, about others
 unke tanaav se aap bhi tari hone lagate hai
 This experience is the proof of a story being alive
 film main irfan nahin hai
 a person is politely irritated or, say, reserved
 adhed hone ko abhishpt
 The plaster has started to crumble from the edges of its cuttings
 or jab film main actor na ho
 If you are just a character, then you understand how satisfying the acting must have been
 nimrat cor ko dekhakar laga hi nahin ki vah pehali baar kisi film main kaam kar rahi hai
 Acting will not say, there seems to be a kind of shallowness in the use of this action after seeing them in the rolls of Ila
 kai mode lekar khud main simati ila
 Some hesitated, believed desperately and then proceeded to travel to that country, where no money means happiness and support
 navazuddin kaa chota sa role he, magar uske safe itane baarik or saaf hai ki shaikh main aap khud ko dekhne lagate hai
 So lonely that he felt like an orphan
 itane majboot ki sab kar daaloongaa kaa jajba rakhte
 And then there was a shameful plot to get things like scooters
 film khatm nahin hoti
 You come out and it goes with you

 They keep creating a new story about what will happen to Ila and Fernandes

 Sons would die in this country jahaan ila kii maa (lilit dube) ko ye sukh nahin he ki byaahta beti unki madad kar rahi he
 It is sad that if his son were alive, today he would not have to spread his hand like this
 maa ye kahati he or bechaargi or khiz main bhari beti se phir paise bhi le leti he
 The mother says this and at the same time Ila's daughter is also turning her hand
