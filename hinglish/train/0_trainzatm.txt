 UP CM Yogi Adityanath has been seen speaking very carefully during his one-year tenure
 pradesh main haal main daliton ke andolan kii vajah se kai jilon main kaaphi bavaal machaa
 Anger can be seen among the Dalits of the state on many questions, but CM Yogi says that there is no anger among the Dalits of the state and it is a conspiracy of some people
 india today ke group edetorial diarector raaj chengappa, india today hindi ke sampadak anshuman tiwari or lakhanu ke samvaadadaata ashish mishra se siem yogi ne tamaam masalon par baatcheet kii
 Increasing Caste Conflict Caste conflict is increasing in UP
 haal main hua daliton kaa andolan iskaa udhaaharan he
 Asked what the UP government is doing about it, the CM said, 'never has the upper caste and scheduled caste clash been seen in the state
 upi main 75 jile hai, haal ke bharat band ke dauraan sirf teen-chaar jilon main hi bavaal hua he
 There is no caste conflict behind these incidents
 jo log daliton ke naam par hinsa kii sajeesh rach rahe hai, unka naam ujagar ho gaya he
 We have taken strict action against them
 'to phir sawaal uthta he ki dalito main itnaa gussa kyon he, is par siem yogi ne kaha, 'yah to dalit gusse kaa maamla hi nahin he
 It is a drama sponsored by those who want to politicize the Dalit issue or use them as pawns
 daliton ke liye jitna bijepi ne kiya he, utana kisi or ne nahin kiya he
 Regarding the SC-ST Act, do you think the anger of the Dalits is justified on the decision of the Supreme Court regarding the SC-ST Atrocities Act, on this question, Yogi Adityanath said, 'to show your views to everyone in democracy Is right
 lekin jo log daliton ke naam par hinsak pradarshan kaa sahaara le rahe hai, unka bhandaphod hoga
 Their true intentions will one day be known
 'siem ne kaha, 'duusari baat yah he ki supreme court kaa nirnay koi nayaa nahin he
 About 11 years ago, the Mayawati government passed a similar order
 centre sarkaar ne to yah bharosa bhi diya he ki vah sarvocch nyaayalay main samiksha yachika daayar karegi
 To add 'ramji' to Baba Saheb's name, UP government has added 'ramji' to Baba Saheb Ambedkar's name, is it not politics of symbolism, on this question, Yogi said that two proposals were received by the government in this regard
 
 unhone kaha, 'pehla prastaav rajyapal ke paas se aayaa tha ki unka naam 'ambedkar' he, na ki 'ambedkar' or baba sahab ne samvidhan kii mul prati main apana dastakhat 'bhimrao raamji ambedkar' ke rup main kiya he, isliye unka naam yahi hona chahie
 The second proposal came from Ambedkar Mahasabha, requesting that there should be a picture of Baba Saheb in all the offices of the state government

 "that night was the weirdest night of my life
 main sone vaala hi tha ki mere bistar ke donon taraf rakhe telephone ek saath bajane lage
 Terror-trembling voices were coming from the other side of the telephone - tonight is our last night, we Kashmiri Pandits will be killed by morning
 " jammu-kashmir main 90 ke dashak main ghati main chale khooni khel or kharaab halaat ko kuch aise hi lafjon main bayaan kiya he purv rajyapal jagmohan ne
 The matter of Jammu and Kashmir is in the limelight with the Modi government's decision on Article 370
 vahaan rajyapal rahane ke dauraan jagmohan ne ghati ke khaufnak maahaul ko kareeb se dekha tha
 From the brutal politics of the valley to the violent incidents, he has described in his book 'dahkte Angare'
 jagmohan aise vakt main jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal rahe, jab aatankwaad or hinsa kii aag main ghati ke jhulasane kaa daur tej ho chalaa tha
 He was the Governor from 1984 to 1990
 april 1984 se june 1989 tak or phir dobaaraa janvari 1990 se may 1990 tak vah rajyapal rahe
 It was Jagmohan, who sacked Farooq Abdullah's government as governor
 1994 tak kii ghatnaon ko sametane vaali apni kitaab main jagmohan ne likhaa he,"aaj jo kashmir he, vah apane itihaas kii do hajaar varshon kii lambii yatra ke dauraan ghatit hone vaali sabhi ghatnaon, vishwasghaat or shadyantron kaa malba or dukhaant naatakon kaa pratifal he
 Many wounds that killed him by history still remain fresh
 san 1947 ke madhya main apane itihaas ke sabase nirnaayak mode par use ek aise chikitsak kii jarurat thi jo uske puraane ghaavon ko sil sake or daagon par maraham laga sake
 Unfortunately this did not happen
 "jab afasar ne dar ke maare chhod diya padajagmohan likhte hai-maine ritred diarector general pir gulam hasan shah ko salaahkaar niyukt kiya
 Also made Shah a cabinet minister
 magar dopaher hote-hote shah kaa man badalane laga or unhone bataaya ki vah yah pad nahin sambhaal sakate
 Because this would endanger the life of his family
 us samay mujhe laga ki aatankwaadiyon kii pakad kitni majboot he
 Officers like Ghulam Hasan Shah are also being forced to step down
 jagmohan likhte hai ki ham jhuthe aadarshon or galat devataaon ke bharose rahe
 We did not pay attention to those roots
 jo sataha ke neeche foot rahi thi
 We ignored the cracks that were in our structure
 hamane ghun lagane diya
 Even when the entire building was about to collapse, New Delhi did not take any action
 dhara 370 kaa durupyogh afasaron ke saath hua bhedbhaavjammu-kashmir main kis tarah anuchhed 370 kii aad main bhedbhaav hue
 There are many such stories in Jagmohan's book
 vah likhte hai ki akhil bhartiya seva ke kuch afasaron ne apane awaas ke liye ek koaparative socity banaai
 He registered this society under the name Rajatarangini
 tab neshnal conference ke abdul rashid or sharifuddin shaarik naamak netaaon ne 1988 main rajya vidhansabha main is maamle ko uthaakar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 The officers were compared to the East India Company and described it as a conspiracy to reverse the balance of population
 mukadmaa chalaae jane kii maang kar di
 Due to which the officers had to dissolve the society
 unki jameen bhi chali gai
 Jagmohan writes that think, only in the housing committee of 32 officers, he had a glimpse of colonizing Kashmir
 32 afasaron kii yah socity jab bani thi, tab kashmir kii aabaadi 70 lakh thi
 The officers asked for a little land to live in that there was uproar
 jagmohan ke mutabik, neshnal conference or anya sahyogi dalon ne aisi bhaawanaaon ke jariye janata ko bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya
 Similarly, Jagmohan narrates another incident
 vah kitaab main kehete hai ki centre sarkaar ne 1988 main dharmik sansthaaon kaa durupyog rokane ke liye ek bill paas kiya
 Due to 370, this law came into force everywhere except Jammu and Kashmir
 kyonki jammu-kashmir ne ise manjuuri hi nahin di
 Whereas apart from Jammu and Kashmir, there was no need to implement this law anywhere else
 jab akhabaaron kii kataranon ne hilaa diyajagmohan ne kitaab dahakate angaare main likhaa he," yah 19 janvari 1990 kii dopaher thi
 i was going to Jammu and Kashmir for the second time by plane
 chah varsh purv 26 april 1984 ko main vimaan dwaara jammu-kashmir gaya tha
 Even then the situation there was bad
 pahunchane ke baad maine brifces main se ek file nikaali
 Which was given to me at the airport by an employee of the Resident Commissioner Office of Jammu and Kashmir
 usamen 12 july 1989 jab mainen rajyapal kaa pad choda tha, se aage tak kii akhabaaron kii kataranen thim
 i started looking at them
 dekha ki pakistan kaa swatantraaa diwas 14 agast shaan se manaaya gaya tha, jabaki bhartiya swatantraaa diwas 15 agast par hadtaal or blike out rakhaa gaya
 The news had terrible titles

 BJP vice-president Tikkalal Taplu was shot in front of his house in Srinagar
 nyaayadhish ganju kii hari singh street main nirmam hatya kar di gai thi
 When Jagmohan wrote a letter to Rajiv Gandhi, on 8 April 1989, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on the situation in Kashmir - taking any step today can be a timely task, tomorrow will be too late
 lekin kal ko parason main badalane diya gaya or parason ko phir agle din taal diya gaya or phir agle din par
 Now that the structure has completely collapsed, once sitting in my small seat in an airplane, i had to come to a turbulent state, carrying the unanswered problems of the past
 ramanavami ke din dilli shahdara ilaake main jis tarah se masjid ke baahar jo naare lage, usne ab raajnneetik rup le liya he
 While Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah described the incident as a BJP conspiracy, the BJP has exposed the Aam Aadmi Party by bringing evidence against that incident against AAP
 shahdara ilaake kii masjid main ramanavami ke din kya kuch hua, is bare main hamane shahdara sthit masjid ke secretary wasim se baat kii to unhone mana ki ramanavami ke din masjid ke baahar maahaul khabar karne kii koshish kii gai
 The sentiments of a society were hurt
 masjid ke baahar galat tarah ke naare lagaae gaye
 At the same time, the secretary of the mosque also admitted that the picture which is appearing in the media, he has seen the person present in that picture along with the common man party MLA and Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel
 masjid ke secretary kaa ye bayaan aam admipartike liye kisi nai musiibat se kam nahin he, kyonki jo aarope aam aadmi party bijepi par laga rahi he, use masjid ke secretary wasim kaa bayaan khaarij kar rahaa he or sarkaar ke aaropon ko kahin naa kahin jhuthla diya he
 However, many people refused to reach him
 koun the wo logilake ke aradblue ke adhyaksh rajesh tiwari kii maane to jo log ramanavami ke din jaloos main aae, unhone 15 minute tak masjid ke baahar talavaarein dikhain or sampradayik naare bhi lagaae, jo ki ilaake ke maahaul ko kharaab karne vaala tha
 People living there also believed that whenever there is a dispute between Hindus and Muslims in the country or anywhere, nothing happens in this area
 ilaake ke logon kaa kahana he ki dilli main raajnneetik partiyaan jo is juluus ko lekar raajnneeti kar rahi hai, wo galat he
 Major negligence of the Indian Railways has been revealed in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh
 darasal, shuukravaar kii raat pashchimi uttar pradesh ke murshadpur railway stesan kaa signal incharge sharaab pikar stesan par hi so gaya jiske kaaran vahaan se guzarane vaali trainon ko jagah jagah khadaa karnaa padaa
 The incident stirred the Western Railway
 signal incharge kii is laaparvaahee ke kaaran teen trainon ko line clear hone kaa sanket nahin mila jiske kaaran unhen raste main hi rokna padaa
 During this time, movement of trains on the jammuutvi-howrah railway line was also stopped
 darasal, trainon ke drivers ko signal kaa sanket nahin mila to unhone adhikariyon se sampark kiya
 Officials arrived at the station after receiving the information that the signal incharge was sleeping drunk
 signal incharge kii is laaparvaahee par sangyaan lete hue railway ne use nilambit kar diya he
 There was a duty of signal incharge named Deep Singh at Murshadpur railway station, located about 10 kilometers from Najibabad
 jahaan wo der raat sharaab pikar so gaya
 About 10 at night
 30 baje nazibabad ke stesan master avinaash gupta ne usase sampark saadhane kii koshish kii lekin uski taraf se koi feedback nahin mila
 The officers then reached there and were found sleeping on a bench made at the Signal Inchargeco station
 uske bench ke neeche sharaab kii bottlen thim
 Given the seriousness of the case, the signal incharge has been suspended with immediate effect
 saath hi uskaa medical bhi karaayaa gaya or uske khilaaf jaanch ke aadesh de die gaye hai
 The political mathematics of Karnataka is getting complicated
 congress-jedies ke baagi vidhayakon ke istife par supreme court ne faisla surakshit rakh liya he or aaj is par faisla aayega
 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on behalf of the rebel mlas in the top court, while Abhishek Manu Singhvi of Karnataka Assembly Speaker K
K
 aar
 Ramesh Kumar and Rajiv Dhawan supported Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy
 kanoon ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki supreme court sahit koi bhi adaalat vidhansabha spikar yaa adhyaksh ko tab tak koi aadesh nahin de sakati he jab tak ki vah vidhayakon kii ayogyata ko lekar antim nirnay nahin le lete hai
 This convenience to the speaker of the assembly is achieved by the judgment of the Supreme Court on 18 February 1992 in the case of Kihoto Holon v
 Zachillahu and others
 karnataka sankat par supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan spikar kaa paksh rakh rahe vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne bhi is cese kaa zikr kiya
 The Speaker's rights are mentioned in para 111 of this judgment
 us dauraan paanch jajon kii peeth ne yah faisla diya tha
 What does the party say about the anti-defection law? Everyone has an eye on the anti-defection law in the Karnataka case
 yah kanoon kahata he ki nirvaachit sadsy yadi vishesh paristhitiyon main apni party chhodte hai to iskaa matlab unki sadsyta kaa radd hona hota he
 The 10th schedule of the Indian Constitution is called anti-defection law
 ise 1985 main 52wein sanshodhan ke saath samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The need for this law was felt when members were seen constantly switching sides without thinking for political gains
 avasarvadita or raajnneetik asthirataa bahut zyada bad gai thi or isse janadesh kii andekhi hone lagi thi
 According to this law, if a member goes to the House to vote against the party whip or if a member voluntarily resigns or an independent, goes to a party after the election or if the nominated member joins any party, then their membership will be canceled
 
 varsh 1985 main kanoon banane ke baad bhi jab adla badali nahin rukii to isamen sanshodhan kiya gaya
 In the year 2003, it was decided that if not only one person, but also a collective change of party would be declared unconstitutional
 isi sanshodhan main dhara teen ko bhi khatm kar diya gaya jiske tahat ek tihaai party sadasyon ko lekar dal badla ja saktaa tha
 Now two-thirds of the members will need consent to do something like this
 yahi ahm praavdhaan karnataka kii maujuuda sthiti par bhi lagu hota he, jo sadan main kisi bhi party ke do tihaai se kam vidhayakon ko todane se roktaa he
 Party members cannot be broken so they are kept in a resort outside the city to keep them together
 kanoon kii samiksha kii mangabaharhaal, chunaav ayog is kanoon ko lekar apni bhoomika main spashtataa chahta he
 There has also been a demand in the middle that in such a situation the opinion of the speaker or the speaker should also be reviewed properly
 or to or swechha se dal chhodane ke arth kii bhi thik se vyakhya kii jaae
 Because this law can also be used to prevent a member from speaking out and the party is supreme that the sentiment can be justified

 doshiyon ko faansee, nirbhaya ko insafaur ye saare sawaal is vakt chaar logon kii vajah se uth rahe hai, jinke naam hai mukesh, pawan, akshay, vinay
 These are the four criminals of Nirbhaya whose death sentence has come on their part
 maut se bachane ke inke saare kanoonee daravaaje ab band ho chuke hai
 Only one mercy door was open, which is with the President
 lekin raham kii ummid naa ke baraabar he
 The mercy petition can be dismissed at any time from Rashtrapati Bhavan
 or jaise hi aisa hota he
 Black warrants will be issued from Patiala House Court in the names of these four
 blike warrant yani maut kaa aakhri paigaam
 What is a black warrant? This 58th person who was hanged in independent India as soon as the black warrant was issued
 59wein, 60wein or 61wein gunahagaar honge
 The first execution in the country was done by Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, while the last, the 57th, was given to Yakub Memon in 2015
 tihaad main aakhri faansee afjal guru ko!to kaayade se in chaaron kii maut kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he
 The news of death can now come anytime
 or ye khabar baahar aegi tihaad jail se
 Where Mukesh, Vinay and Akshaya have been closed for the last seven years
 jabaki pawan jo ki ab tak mondoli jail main band tha, use bhi ab mondoli jail se tihaad bhej diya gaya he
 Because there is no arrangement for hanging in Mandoli jail
 sunsaan jagah par he faansee kothi1945 main tihaad jail bananaa shuru hua tha
 Tihar was completed 13 years later in 1958
 or kaidi vahaan aana shuru ho gaye
 a map of the hanging house was also made on the map of Tihar in the British era
 usee nakshe ke hisaab se faansee ghar banaaya gaya
 Which is now called hanging kothi
 ye faansee kothi tihaad ke jail number teen main kaidiyon ke barrack se bahut dur bilkul alag-thalag sunsaan jagah par he
 What is hanging cell, death cell, number three, the building in which there is hanging cell, there are a total of 16 death cells in the same building
 deth cell yani wo jagah jahaan sirf unheen kaidiyon ko rakhaa jaataa he, jinhen maut kii sazaa mili he
 The prisoner is kept alone in the death cell
 24 ghante main sirf aadhe ghante ke liye use baahar nikaala jaataa he tahalne ke liye
 The death cell is guarded by the Tamil Nadu Special Police
 do-do ghante kii shift main inkaa kaam sirf or sirf maut kii sajaa paae kaidiyon par nazren rakhane kaa hota he
 So that he does not try to commit suicide
 isiilie deth cell ke kaidiyon ko baaki or cheez to chhodie pyjame kaa naada tak pahanane nahin diya jaataa
 The prisoners are alone in the death cell
 After the signing of the jailbreak warrant, the court decides the date and time of execution by looking at the suggestions and preparation of the jail administration
 iske baad sabase pehla kaam hota he, faansee ke liye jallaad dhundhna or doosraa kaam fande kii rassi kaa intjaam karnaa
 However, the last three executions in the country, which were given to Kasab, Afzal Guru and Yakub Memon, were done without professional executioner
 teenon hi maamle main liver police vaale ne hi khinchaa tha
 The noose rope of the Manila ropefansi is not made for hanging
 balki ye ek khaas rassi hoti he
 Which is called Manila rope
 faansee ke fande ke liye ye rassi desh main sirf bihar kii baxur jail main taiyaar hoti he
 Manila rope was ordered from Buxar to hang Afzal Guru
 jisaki keemat thi 860 rupee
 However, more money was spent on rent than rope
 afjal guru ke trial main 2 baar tuuti thi rassiek baar manila rope jail pahunchan jane ke baad ab usee rassi se trial hota he
 Trial means the practice of hanging before hanging
 iske liye baqayada faansee par chadaaye jane vaale shaks kii lambaai, vajan gardan kii naap, sab liya jaataa he
 Then a sand bag of exactly the same size and weight is bent
 yahi vajah he ki jis shaks ko faansee di jaani hoti he, uske vajan or lambaai kaa ricard rojaanaa apadet hota rahata he
 During the first trial of Afzal Guru's hanging, the rope was broken twice
 aise taiyaar hoti he faansee kii rassifaansee ke liye rassi kii lambaai bhi kaidiyon ke vajan ke hisaab se tay hoti he
 Actually, the planks on which to hang
 us takhte ke neeche kuen kii gaharaai 15 feet hoti he
 So that there is a complete gap between the ground and the swinging leg
 faansee ke fande par jhulane vaale shaks kaa vajan agar 45 kilo yaa usase kam he to phir takhte ke neeche kuen main latakane ke liye rassi kii lambaai zyada rakhi jaati he
 Which is about eight feet
 jabaki faansee par chadaaye jane vaale shaks kaa vajan agar 90 kilo yaa usase zyada he, to kuen main jhulane ke liye rassi kii lambaai kam rakhi jaati he
 About six feet
 aisa isliye hota he vajan kii vajah se rassi par dabaav zyada padataa he
 The length of the rope is measured not from the head but from the jaw below the left ear
 kyonki faansee ke fande kii ganth vahiin se shuru hoti he
 Hanging together the culprits of Nirbhaya! The hanging cell in Tihar Jail number three was the first and last hanging of two people in the hanging cell on 37 January, 31 January 1982, to Ranga Billa
 chaar logon ko ek saath faansee tihaad main kabhi nahin hui
 But the number of criminals of Nirbhaya is four
 haalanki desh main chaar logon ko ek saath isse pehle bhi faansee ho chuki he
 But she was in Yadavada Jail in Pune
 27 november 1983 ko
 Four people who killed ten people, known as Joshi Abhyakar Case, were then hanged together
 to kya nirbhaya ke chaaron gunahagaaron ko bhi ek saath tihaad main faansee di ja sakati he?do-do karke bhi di ja sakati he faanseetihaad main jo faansee kothi he uske takhte kii lambaai kareeb das feet he
 That means there is enough space
 jiske upar ek saath chaar logon ko khadaa kiya ja sake
 All it needs to do is to fasten the four hanging loops on the iron rod above the planks
 takhte ke neeche bhi lohe kii rod hoti he
 Due to which the board opens and closes
 is rod kaa conection takhte ke said main lage liver se hota he
 On pulling the liver, the lower rod is removed and both ends of the throne open downwards
 jisase takht par khadey shaks ke pair neeche kuen main jhul jate hai
 In a death cell, a person who is hanged a day or two before the last pulsation is removed from the death cell and put into another cell
 chunki faansee kothi deth cell ke kareeb he
 In such a situation, what is going on with the preparation of hanging
 kaise trial ho rahaa he
 They cannot see all this, so it is done
 vasiyat or aakhri mulakatfaansee se pehle agar marane vaala koi vasiyat karnaa chahta he to baqayada district magistrate ko jail bulawaakar unke saamne uski vasiyat likhi jaati he
 Similarly, the last time the relative whom he wants to meet is also introduced to him
 faansee se pehle poochi jaati he chyjis subah faansee di jaani he
 At about four o'clock in the morning, the hanger is picked up
 usase nahaane or nae kapade pahanane ko kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes the prisoner refuses to bathe or wear new clothes
 jaise ranga-billaa ne kiya tha
 On the morning of death, the prisoner is asked only for tea
 cell se faansee ke takhte tak kaa safariske baad blike warrant par likhe vakt ke hisaab se kaidi ko uske cell se baahar nikaala jaataa he
 There are 12 armed guards around him
 kai baar to kaidi ko baqayada kandhe se uthaa kar le jaaya jaataa he kyonki maut ke dar kii vajah se uske pair tak kaanp rahe hote hai
 The prisoner is taken from the cell to the gallows covering his face
 taaki uske aas-paas kya chal rahaa he wo dekh naa sake
 In the presence of a magistrate, how many people will stay in the hanging house
 iske liye bhi jail manyaal main saaf likhaa he
 a doctor who signs the death certificate
 ek sab diviginal magistrate
 Whose surveillance is the whole process of hanging
 jailer or dipti supretendent jailer
 Apart from this, 10 constables and two head constables or equally armed guards are present there
 faansee ke vakt kiskaa kya rolefaansee kothi pahunchane ke baad aam taur par koi bhi jail staff yaa jallaad aapas main baat nahin karte hai
 All remain silent
 iske aage kii sari karrwai ishaaron main hoti he
 The jailer gestures by dropping the handkerchief down as soon as the black warrant arrives
 liver pakade jallaad yaa pulisavaala liver khinch detaa he
 For the first time half an hour after the liver is pulled, the doctor locates the beating and pulse of the person who died
 agar gadkan ruk gai or nabj tham gai tab doctor ke ishaare par faansee ke fande se laash neeche utaar lee jaati he
 During the process of hanging, no one is as heavy as he is in jail; his neck is stretched as much during the execution
 jailer yaa jallaad hameshaa yahi dua maangate hai ki faansee ke dauraan qaidi kii maut gardan kii haddi tuutane se hi ho
 Because this causes death less painful and in less time
 puri faansee kii karrwai ke dauraan jab tak faansee apane anjaam ko nahin pahunch jaati or jab tak laash fande se neeche nahin utaar lee jaae, tab tak puri jail ke andar har kaam roak diya jaataa he
 Every prisoner has his cell in his barrack
 jail main koi movement nahin hota
 It is part of the prison manual
 par ek baar jaise hi faansee kii prakiya khatm hoti he to jail kii zindagi dobaaraa shuru ho jaati he

 Lord Mountbatten once said that while history sometimes seems to move quietly by a glacial movement, sometimes it moves forward leaving everything behind in a hurry
 yah kathan kashmir se zyada or kahin charitaarth hota nahin dikhataa, jahaan kuch daur aise bhi rahe, jab tavaarikh bilkul sann khadi pai gai
 Absolutely impassive like the huge snow-capped mountains that surround the valley — in the words of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, "a wharf of baharas or an iron fort against the palaces of kings
" ''kai daur aise bhi aate hai, jab itihaas kisi nadi kii ufanti laharon-sa aage badhata he or ghati kii chaati ko chirakar use khunrej kar daalata he
 Right now, this is happening in Kashmir
 nae daur ke ugravadiyon kaa nayak burhan vaani jab 8 july ko suraksha balon ke saath ek muthbhed main maaraa gaya, uske baad shuru hue virodh pradarshnon main ab tak 71 se zyada log maare ja chuke hai jinamein do pulisavaale bhi hai
 As the fire raged, around 7,000 people were injured

 The 50-day curfew may have been lifted on August 29, but there is frightening silence
 zyaadaatar aabaadi, khaskar noujvaan bheetar hi bheetar sulag rahe hai
 The situation is critical
 itihaas kashmir main khud ko doharaata-sa bhi dikhataa he
 This is not the first time a 35-member all-party delegation, led by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, is going to visit from September 4 to understand the current crisis in the Valley and start the process of building confidence
 isse pehle 2010 main jab surakshabalon kii kathith farji muthbhedon ke khilaaf ghati sulgi thi, us vakt bhi halaat ko sanbhaalane ke liye kendriya grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram reached Kashmir with an all-party delegation

 Before leaving for Srinagar, Rajnath Neindia Today said, "we have love not only from the land of Kashmir, but also from the people of Kashmir
 ham kashmir kaa sthaayee samaadhaan nikaalenge, lekin isamen samay lag saktaa he
 Despite this statement, Rajnath realizes that the current situation may worsen and it may take time to find a permanent solution
 duusari intifada (baghawat)?jammu-kashmir ke vitt mantri tathaa sattadhari pidipi ke vichaarak haseeb drabu maanate hai ki maujuuda halaat kii tulana haalia ateet ke un duusare maukon se karnaa sarleekaran hoga, jinhone rajya par asar daalaa he
 For example, in 2008 there was an agitation in the state on the question of transfer of land by the Governor to Shri Amarnathji Tirthaboard, which lasted for 60 days and killed 38 people
 uske baad 2010 main sena dwaara kupwada ke machhil sector main kathith farji muthbhed par asantosh bhadkaa tha, jisamen teen naujavaanon ko 'pakistani ghuspaithiya' bataakar maar diya gaya tha, jiske baad hui police golibari main tufail mattu naamak ek pradarshnkaree chaatr kii maut ho gai thi
 That time the valley had been burning for three months and lost 120 lives
 rajnatik tippaneekar prem shankar jha maujuuda pradarshnon ko 'duusari intifada' kaa naam dete hai
 Drabu does not consider it appropriate to compare it to the 1989-90 movement, which many people call the 'first intifada'
 us vakt ke andolan ke peeche ekaadhik kaaran maujuud the—afghanistan main jehad kaa ubhaar, pakistan kii yudhkari maansikta, centre main kamjor sarkaar or rajya kii sarkaar main logon kaa avishvaas—jinke chalate ghati niyantran se baahar hoti chali gai
 It was after this movement that the controversial Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA) was enacted in the Valley in 1990, which gave the security forces free power to crush any mass movement
 isi ke baad algaavvaadi andolan kii ekajutata ol party hurriyat conference ke rup main ubhari, jiskaa istemaal baad main pakistan ne apni chaaya ke bataur kiya
 Drabu admits that what happened in the nineties was a movement of "ethnicity and nationality", while the source of the current rise is very different
 unke mutabik, ''aaj halaat takreeban arajak hai
 There is a series of historical mistakes behind its birth
 udasin vartmaan, sankatagrast ateet or anishchit bhavishya iske peeche he
 It is not just about unemployment or lack of economic development
 yah samaaj main hue badlaav se taalluk rakhata he, jisamen sanchaar ke tareeke badale hai or naujavaanon kii aakankshaayen badali hai
 It is also related to the trends of political freedom around the world
 ye sab milakar maahaul ko or zyada najuk tathaa jwalanth banaate hai
 "the intensity of tension can be understood by this, but there have been some immediate reasons which are to blame for both the state and central governments
" jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla kii daleel he ki hinsa kaa kaaran pidipi ke saath bijepi ke gathjod ke khilaaf logon main ''pal rahaa gussa'' tha
 They point out that "violent protests were mostly concentrated in areas where PDP dominates
" aap jab bijepi ko doshi tehraate hue chunaav prachaar karte hai or yah kehete hai ki aresas ek khatarnaak sanghathan he, uske baad achaanak aap oonche vaade karke uske saath apane gathjod ko sahi tehraane lag jate hai, jabaki ve vaade puure nahin hote
 From that, you make the Chief Minister what the people had thought to be his last hope, a soft separatist who would take Delhi to the public, but he could not live up to his image, then a situation of disenchantment arises
 ''siyaasi uthaa-patkebdulla kaa nishkarsh thod kathor he
 It was just three months before Mehbooba Mufti became the Chief Minister that the entire crisis started after the death of Wani
 ve ab bhi apane pita mufti mohammad said kii maut ke shok se nahin ubar pai thim ki prashasan par apni pakad bana paatin
 Mehbooba had expressed her objection to an alliance with the BJP following the fractured mandate in the 2014 assembly elections
 pidipi ko ghati main adhiktar siten mili thim, jabaki bijepi jammu main baari padi thi
 Mukrati persuaded Mehbooba and the cadre of the party that alliance with the BJP was inevitable
 pehle bhi rajya ke mukhyamantri rah chuke said apni bhoomika ko jammu-kashmir, rajya or centre, bharat or pakistan ke bich ek pul ke bataur dekhte the
 That is why the right-wing BJP and the moderate separatist PDP came together in a historic event by forming a 'government-centric' alliance, which at the time seemed favorable to the state
 said ne jab 1 march, 2015 ko mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee to pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi us aayojan main shariq hue
 The warm embrace of both of them on the stage was a symbol of the distance the two parties had covered
 pakistan aarambh main khandit janadesh par khush tha lekin is ghatnakram ne use spasht rup se asahaj kar daalaa
 In the process of moving the margins of the Hurriyat and adopting the pdp's soft separatism, the Mufti was neatly posed by Islamabad
 pakistan pidipi ko ek aise dal ke rup main dekhtaa tha, jo swaittata ke liye jor laga saktaa tha or dilli kii 'apane main milaane vaali sajishon' kaa pratirodh kar saktaa tha
 The BJP-PDP alliance broke his dream
 iske baad pakistan tatkaal is gathjod ko chhedgaye kii disha main kaam karne laga
 It seems that the plan he had planned went ahead of time and quite easily
 sankat paidaa hone main zyada vakt nahin laga
 At a rally after the swearing in, the Mufti thanked Pakistan and the separatists for not obstructing the election
 is bayaan ko rashtriya media le uda, jiske chalate sattadhari gathjod charmarane laga
 Drabu points out that the Mufti was quoted from the context as he further stated that "pakistan has finally developed an understanding of the benefits and values of democracy
" '' bijepi ko bhi dosha jaataa he ki usne said ke liye har faisle yaa uthaae har kadam par jarurat se zyada pratikriya di
 When he announced the release of Masrat Alam, arrested in 2010 demonstrations, he was forced to reverse the decision
 pratishthit academik or mufti ke salaahkaar rahe amitabh mattu is baat kii ore ishaara karte hai ki marhoom netaa ko hameshaa is baat kaa ehsaas rahaa ki hurriyat or pakistan jaise sabhi paksh suraksha or sthirataa muhaiyaa karaayenge
 Drabu explains that when Mufti came to know that the name of Hurriyat was not mentioned in the pdp's election manifesto, he insisted that he handwrite his name on the printed copies before releasing it
 yahaan tak ki bijepi ke saath gathjod ke agenda main hurriyat se baatcheet ko saaf taur par rakhaa gaya tha
 Despite this, the Modi government took harsh measures against the Hurriyat — and even canceled official talks with Pakistan because its ministers wanted to meet the Hurriyat — hence a serious setback to Saeed's efforts to ease the confidence-building process
 felt
 jaisaa ki mattu samajhate hai, asal masalaa yah tha ki mufti ''rajkaaj or vikaas ko gathjod kaa centrebindu'' maanate the or yah samajhate the ki bijepi ke saath gathjod karne se unhen centre kii ore se jaruri fund mil jayega
 It happened that his initial months passed in the inner turmoil and the whole time remained entangled between politics, economy and development
 centre ne baadh raahat kii raashi kaa vaada karne ke baad jis tareeke se use jari kiya, use lekar ve ghor niraash the
 After the devastating floods in Srinagar, Modi gave the state Rs 44,000 crore
 dene kaa vaada kiya tha, jo rajya ne raahat or punarvaas ke liye maange the
 Drabu says that the Mufti kept asking continuously whether the money reached the beneficiaries or not
 vidambnaa dekhie ki jis din unki maut hui, thik usee din centre ne paisa hastantarit kiya, lekin tab tak ve ja chuke the
 Mehbooba was shattered by the coup's death
 gathbandhan ke kaam karne ke tareeke se bhi unka mohabhang ho gaya tha
 She said that she will not discuss any succession of leadership before 40 days of heat is over
 unhone jamini str se party ko khadaa kiya tha, isiilie ve party kii kaman sanbhaalane main zyada dilchaspee rakhti thim or rajkaaj kaa kaam unhone pita ke jimme chhod rakhaa tha
 Governments in Jammu and Kashmir are elected for six years, so the members of the party also hoped that the command would come into their hands only after half of this period had passed, but the destiny was somewhat different
 mahabuuba ne kaman sanbhaalane se pehle bijepi se is baat kaa aashwaasan le liya ki gathbandhan sarkaar ke agenda main kiye gaye kuch vishisht vaadon kaa vah sammaan karegi
 These included the transfer of land, which was taken by the Ministry of Defense but which was lying vacant
 iske alaava enechapisi dwaara sanchalit do urja sanyantron kaa rajya sarkaar ko hastantaran, hurriyat or pakistan ke saath sanlagnta ko protsaahan or akrasapa ko hataae jane par sangyaan lenaa shaamil tha
 The state unit of the BJP was not very happy with these demands and several rounds of talks failed to break the deadlock
 is dauraan pidipi ke kuch sadasyon ne ek vaikalpik yojana banaai taaki party se alag hokar ek anya morcha banaaya ja sake, jo bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar sake
 Governor N

 Vohra gave a strong instruction to the central government not to try to topple Mehbooba's government or else the state would become unstable
 aakhir main rajnath or modi, donon hi is suzav se sahamat ho gaye
 Due to the rebellion in the party, Mehbooba asked for time to meet Modi in Delhi, but despite waiting for a long time, he could not give him time due to any reason
 ve jhunjhalaahat main srinagar pahunchin or unka man tha ki gathbandhan ko todgaye kaa elaan kar daalen
 When the Prime Minister got information about this, he immediately sent his message to them
 unase kaha gaya ki ve apni maangen puraa karne kaa aashwaasan likhit main lene kii jid na karen or kursi sanbhaalein
 Be assured that all their concerns will be addressed

 He took the step of administrative reshuffle, but his decisions on appointments kept changing
 aisa lagata tha ki unke kai salaahkaar hai jo alag-alag dishaao main khinchataan machaae hue hai
 He was also accused that he transferred senior police officers without any reason and replaced his favorite local Muslim officers
 is dauraan bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandhon main bhi khatas aana shuru ho chuki thi
 Seeing the PDP-BJP alliance in crisis, Pakistan started activating its elements in Kashmir
 barf pighali to elosi par seemapar ghuspaith main ijapha hone laga
 The Indian Army reports that infiltration has doubled since May
 is baat kii bhi report he ki islamabad se ghati main baithe pakistani samarthakon ke paas sidhe paison kii aamad hone lagi
 At the same time, the Hurriyat stepped up its campaign against the Mehbooba government
 mahabuuba ke kursi sanbhaalane ke thik baad hi usne pandit or sainik coloniyon kii sthapana kaa masalaa uthaa diya, jiskaa prastaav sarkaar ne rakhaa tha
 The purpose of the Pandit colonies was to rehabilitate the Kashmiri Hindus who became homeless in the 1989–91 movement
 sainik coloniyon kaa uddeshy rajya ke avkaash praapt sashastr bal karmiyon ko basaanaa tha
 The separatists compared these colonies to Israeli settlements, and Hurriyat president Syed Ali Shah Geelani warned that "people should be prepared to oppose conspiracies that aim to change the face of Kashmir's population
" ''dabaav main mahabuuba ne is yojana ko lataka diya
 He also shelved Mufti's new industrial policy, under which it was proposed to lease the land to industrialists from outside the state for a longer period
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir main un logon ko jameen lene kii manaahi he, jo rajya se baahar ke hon, chaahe janm se yaa vansh se
 Saeed's policy was called an attempt by the separatists to change the population structure here by bringing in large numbers of people from outside the state
 in pradarshnon ne udyogpatiyon ko hataash kar diya, jo vaise bhi yahaan ke suraksha halaat ko lekar chintit the
 By June, security forces had begun to warn both the state and central governments that dissatisfaction lay beneath the surface in the valley and could boil at any time
 ghati kii nigaraanee karne vaali sena kii 15veen kor ke jiosi (general officer commanding) leftinent general satish kumaar dua bataate hai ki unki tukdishaan lagaataar ek nae rujhaan kii report de rahi thim ki jab kisi aatanki ko pakadaaey ke liye oparation chalaaya jaataa tha, sthaneey log baari sankhya main ikattha ho jate the or suraksha gheraa todakar surakshabalon par hamalaa bol dete the
 According to him, a stern warning was issued that if someone tries to disrupt the operation, the army will be forced to take 'appropriate action' against him
 unka kahana tha ki burhan vaani kii maut se kaaphi pehle hi asantosh paidaa ho chukaa tha
 Wani's death: Security sources say that Wani's death in the encounter was not well planned
 surakshabal ek anya aatanki sartaaj shaikh ke peeche the or unhen koi khabar nahin thi ki us thikaane par vaani bhi maujuud he
 When he attacked the hideout and killed three terrorists, he recognized that there was a wani among them
 iske baad vaani kii tasviir whatsap se srinagar bheji gai taaki uski pushti kii ja sake
 The security forces always took Vani lightly because they considered him a hero of social media, not a real threat
 vah bhale hi hijbul mujahidin kaa commander tha, lekin prashikshan lene ke liye baahar nahin gaya tha or use kaccha or shoshebaaj samajha jaataa tha
 The state and central security forces did not expect such a reaction to Wani's death
 uske grihnagar traal main uske janaaje main umadi bheed par ve hairat main the—kuch akhabaaron ne bataaya ki do lakh se zyada log isamen aae the
 During this time, the PDP and other parties started a game of accusation that Wani was killed in an encounter or murdered after being caught
 isse surakshabal kaaphi hatotsahit hue, jo ab tak apane kaam ko shandaar samaj rahe the
 In the wake of the crisis, state and central police forces tightened security on Srinagar and important highways
 unhen virodh pradarshnon ke prakaar, prasar or uske nishaanon kaa pehle se koi andaja nahin tha
 Most of the demonstrations took place in southern Kashmir, a stronghold of the PDP
 bade shaharon kii jagah bheed taluka str par or choti rihaaishon main hamale karne lagi
 The furious mob burnt around 50 police outposts and sub-divisional courts
 yah sab hairatnaak tha
 The most surprising thing was the participation of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 20, who came out in large numbers and threw stones at the security forces
 police kahati he ki unki aguai aatankwaadi kar rahe the, jo grenade phenkate the or golibari bhi karte the
 In the face of this violence, the police started firing pellets, which are not fatal
 isi dauraan kai pradarshnakariyon kii ankhon main chharre lage
 The actual number of sight loss is much lower than what is being reported
 sirf paanch logon kii donon ankhon kii roshni gai he or 15 kii ek aankh kii roshni
 During this time, terrorist groups blocked all entry and exit routes in the villages
 sthaneey adhikariyon kii to chhod den, yahaan tak ki vidhayak bhi apane ilaakon main nahin ja sake
 Seeing the situation go out of control, Modi did two things
 unhone rajnath singh ko ghati bheja taaki ve mahabuuba kaa haath tham saken or unhen har kism kii madad muhaiyaa kara saken
 In addition, Modi convened an all-party meeting to discuss Kashmir and decided to take united action to end the crisis
 mahabuuba kii bechaini ko shant karne main rajnath singh adarsh sabit hue
 He refused to use the chopper to visit the affected areas and went by car to those places to show that he was confident of the security forces
 unhone protocol ko darkinar karte hue mahabuuba ke awaas par ek sanyukt press conference ko sambodhit kiya (koshish kii gai thi ki ise mukhyamantri awaas ke paas kisi or ke awaas main rakhaa jaae lekin jab pataa chalaa ki vah jagah hari nivas he, jo kaaphi samay se khaali padaa he or jiske bare main sthaneey manyata yah he ki usamen rahane vaala ksht uthaane ke liye abhishpt ho jaataa he to is vichaar ko hi chhod diya gaya)
 Even when Mehbooba abruptly ended the press conference, Rajnath did not lose his restraint and was seen making genuine efforts to build trust between the state and the Center
 rajnath or modi se samvaad ke baad mahabuuba kaa najariya buniyadi rup se badla hua dikhaa
 His confidence had returned
 unhone 'apane bacchon' ko marane ke liye chhod dene vaale algaavvaadiyon par aakrosh jaahir kiya or inhen shah dene vaale pakistan ko aade haathon liya
 During this, Omar Abdullah reached out to Modi, leading the all-party delegation and said, "the Prime Minister was very confident and he has spoken of a permanent solution rather than a practical way
" '' udhar, ghati main suraksha balon ke karfu lagane or biguef tathaa anya kendriya balon kii sankhya badhaane ke saath hi halaat shant hone lage
 Despite this, it took a total of 50 days to remove the curfew from most areas and sporadic demonstrations are still going on
 kya kiya janaa chahieane vaale maheenon main rajya or centre ko teen ahm praathamiktaaon par khud ko kendrit karnaa hoga
 The first thing is to restore the rule of law rapidly and normalize the situation
 doosraa, kaam rajkaaj or vikaas ko sambodhit karnaa he, taaki sevaayen abaadh rup se jari rah saken or log swasth tareeke se rojgaar kar saken
 The third, and perhaps most difficult, task is to open the way for dialogue with all parties, so that a 'permanent' and 'sustainable' solution to this six-decade-old dispute can be found together
 kanoon-vyavastha ke maamle main jaruri he ki surakshabalon main aatmavishvaas dobaaraa kaayam kiya jaae
 They should be given complete freedom to control the mob and take possession of their territory
 jaisaa ki ek varisht police adhikari bataate hai, andruni ilaakon main vyavastha kaayam karne ke liye surakshabalon ko 'salaami slis' oparation ko anjaam dena hoga
 Villages that are allegedly under terrorists have to be captured in a systematic way
 iske liye jaruri hoga ki aatankiyon ko pakadaa jaae or hiraasat main liya jaae
 In this order, the forces must be vigilant and prevent the mob from gathering
 khaali padi police chaukiyon par teji se tainaati kii jaani hogi or nasht ho chuki chaukiyon ko dobaaraa banaaya janaa hoga
 To return to normalcy, the government should resume work, schools should be opened and traders should be encouraged to do business

 By the middle of October, there will be snow on the passes and the intrusion will cease naturally

 The fact that many political parties in India, especially the ruling BJP, have always advocated the removal of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gives Jammu and Kashmir a special status in the Indian constitution, and this fact has also been used to add fuel to this fire
 The system is a sign of the signing of the merger of the Government of India with Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Kashmir in 1947

 Way to ensure unauthorized colonies
 There will be 1797 unauthorized colonies in Safdilli
 a long standing demand of regular Delhiites is nearing completion
 centre sarkaar ne avaidh coloniyon main rah rahe logon ko malikana haq dene kii manjuuri de di he
 According to the Delhi government, there are a total of 1797 unauthorized colonies in Delhi
 in sabhi coloniyon main rahane vaale logon ko is pahal kaa laabh milegaa
 Not only this, lawsuits related to land will also end
 dilli ke uparajyapal ne gaanvon main bhoomi vivaad ko khatm karne ke prastaav par muhar laga di he
 For years, the hopes of people living in these illegal colonies of Delhi are going to be fulfilled and a lot will change in these colonies - be it private or government land will get ownership
 1797 Millions of people living in unauthorized colonies will always worry about losing their homes was
 lekin ab aisa nahin hoga
 Now their property will be registered
 unki property ko kanoonee manyata milegi
 The most important thing is that if a colony is situated on government land, it will also get ownership
 nijee jameen par basii yaa sarkari jameen par basii colony ho uske plot, makaan ko kanoonee manyata milegi
 Registry, purchase-horse will be given legal status at a nominal rate, now in illegal colonies, horse-trading will get legal status and property will now be registered
 plot yaa bhawan kii registry ke liye sarkaar kii ore se kuch chhot bhi di ja sakati hai
 It is being told that the government will not charge much for this
 sarkaar kii ore se vichaar kiya ja rahaa he kirgistry kaa shulkkam ho jisase ki log aasaani se registry kara saken
 It is being told that the registration fee can also be relaxed to be paid in two installments
 sadak, park, siver line, jaise honge vikaas ke kamlog in coloniyon main na jane kab se rah rahe hai lekin suvidhaon ke naam par kuch bhi nahin
 After the colonies become legal, now the facility of road, park, sewer line will be available here
 sabase adhik samasya siver line ke nahin hone kii vajah se ho rahi thi
 After the colonies pass, the sewer line will be laid, the park will be facility as well as many development works will start
 property par le sakenge lonin coloniyon main rahane vaale logon kii property par ab tak lone nahin miltaa tha
 If anyone went to buy a flat in these colonies, he was not given a loan from any bank
 yadi kisi ko koi property kharidni bhi hoti thi to use ek baar main hi sari rakam deni hoti he
 If a person living in these colonies needed a loan at the time of trouble or for any important work, he could not take a loan on his property even if he wanted
 ab aasaani se yah donon dikkat dur hogi
 There will be no loss and theft of GPA chains
 Until now, the trading in these colonies was done through the General Power of Attorney (GPA)
 sabase badi dikkat yah he ki jipie ke paper ko sambhalakar rakhana
 There is a whole chain of who, when, whom, property is sold or bought
 jisko sambhalakar rakhana padataa tha
 If by mistake, any paper was lost or stolen, then there was a problem in front of him
 property aapaki he iske liye sabase bada saboot jipie hi he
 This mess will also get rid of once the registry is started
 community centre, health clinics kii hogi suvidhacoloniyaan regularise hone ke baad yahaan kai suvidhaayen di jaaengi, jo ab tak nahin milti thi

 Sometimes a horse wins unexpectedly in horse racing
 aisa kyon hota he aakhir? isliye nahin ki ham use dekh nahin pate, isliye ki hamane uske bare main kabhi sochaa nahin hota
 There are so many horses in the field in the presidential race
 kuch nahin to kam-se-kam pranab mukherjee iklaute hai, jo nirvirodh jeet sakate hai
 Then why would Sonia Gandhi bet on a horse that is not in our mind? This is because in the event of different colored horses present in the field, some special results are also associated with them
 sonia gandhi hi hai, jinhen shuru se lekar ant tak saare faisle karne hai
 Let us calculate from their point of view and start from here that our clean Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has finally bubbled in the tongue that Rashtrapati Bhavan will be the best refuge for his retirement
 sonia jaanati hai ki mahangaai kaa maaraa or bhrashtachar main jal rahaa matadaata ab upie-2 ko bardaasht nahin kar paa rahaa or is dishaheen thake-haare gathjod ke din lad chuke hai
 Hence, it will be a respectful farewell for Manmohan Singh to make room for a new beginning

 The question arises that who will sit on Manmohan's chair again? Manmohan Singh now looks downcast, but he does not look like this when he is abroad

 lekin chunki congress ke bheetar padanukram se samjhauta sambhav nahin, lihaaja manmohan kii kursi par jo bhi aayega, vah antarim hi hoga
 The candidates standing in the queue have no problem with this
 unamem se zyaadaatar to ek din kaa pradhanmantri ban kar hi tar jaaenge
 The problem is that the queue is full

 Chidambaram may be thought of, but his reputation is waning and it will not send the right message to the people of this country who are in the mood to punish him
 yadi sonia gandhi cabinet ko na chheden to unke paas rajyasabha ke sabhapati or loksabhaa adhyaksh, yani hamid ansaari va mira kumaar kaa hi vikalp bachataa he
 Both are worthy, but have their own problems
 kya unhen gathbandhan ke saare saajheedaar sweekaar kar lenge? khaskar jab unhen maaloom he ki congress ko apana raashtrapati niyukt karnaa he?maujuuda upie ke paas 11,50,000 ke electorat main 4,60,000 vot hai
 Therefore, it will need one or two allies outside the alliance

 Even though the Congress had fewer mps at the time, but due to better leadership and public support, an unknown Pratibha Patil got through
 kahin aisa na ho ki sari kataai-chantai karne ke baad puri tarah thak chuki congress dobaaraa pratibha patil ke naam par hi jaakar ruk jaae, jo nishchit taur par sabase kam vivaadit hai
 His reputation has been blurred, but in a culture where leaders also record a period of time in jail in their biodata, what is the problem with believing them innocent and their greatest merit is still that they are Sonia's biggest loyalists Huh
 pratibha patil ke saath ek sabase bada rajnatik lakshan natthi haih yathasthiti

 In 2007, Shiv Sena supported Patil for regional reasons
 ho saktaa he ki sonia bhaajapa ko uparashtrapati pad kaa laalach de daalen
 See, how suddenly an unexpected candidate came into the mind of Sonia Gandhi, who might be leaving behind the other names still running

 Before next year's Lok Sabha elections, there is a constant fluctuation in the politics of Bihar

 RLSP chief Upendra Kushwahane has targeted a former Nitish Kumar government
 kendriya rajya mantri or ralospa pramukh upendra kushvaha ne mangalvaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par apratyaksh rup se nishaanaa sadhate hue aarope lagaaya ki rajya main aparaadhiyon ke man main kanoon kaa dar nahin rah gaya he
 Targeting the Chief Minister: He targeted the Chief Minister on Tuesday after killing a worker of his party at Vaishali District Headquarters Hajipur after meeting his grieving family members
 unhone kaha, 'hatyaein ho rahi hai
 The Chief Minister himself should take cognizance of such incidents and discuss the disorder with his officers
 'upendra ne haal hi main kaha tha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko apane chauthe kaarykaal ke liye daawa nahin karnaa chahie
 Recently, he had given a formula for making 'siyasi Kheer' in which he indicated the alliance of Yaduvanshis and Kushvans
 centre main shasit endie main ahmiyat nahin milane se naaraaz maane ja rahe upendra ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki bihar main sakriy aparaadhiyon ke man se kanoon kaa dar gaayab ho gaya he
 This is a challenge before the administration

 The claim of the government, the situation improved by tweeting that the fall of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) -led Mahagathbandhan government and the return of the NDA government committed to establishing the rule of law has been a big success in the past one year

 BJP in the state seems to be ready to accept Nitish Kumar as his elder brother
 lekin nitish or bijepi main gaharaati dosti, 2014 main modi ke saathi bane upendra kushvaha ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 Perhaps that's why Kushwaha is showing rebel attitude

 Kushwaha then said, 'if you get milk of Yaduvanshi (yadav) and rice of Kushwanshi (koiri Samaj), then kheer will be good and nothing can stop the preparation of that delicious dish
 'baad main unhone ise or spasht karte hue kaha ki yah kheer tab tak swaadisht nahin hogi jab tak isamen choti jatiyon or dabe-kuchle samaaj kaa panchmeva nahin padegaa
 This is the real definition of social justice

 But after Nitish's entry in the NDA, there is not much political space left for Upendra Kushwaha
 aise main kushvaha bhi ek majboot siyaasi saathi ke talash main hai
 The pair of Upendra Kushwaha and Lalu Prasad Yadav may prove to be the trump card for each other

 padosi desh nepal main 2000, 500 or 200 ke bhartiya note par pratibandh laga diya gaya hai
 Not only this, if these Indian notes are caught in Nepal, there can be jail

 Indian buyers or tourists are reluctant to visit Nepal, because only 100 rupees Indian notes are valid in Nepal
 nepal ke birganj kaa adarsh bazaar pehle bhartiya kharidadaaron se bharaa rahata tha, lekin aaj yahaan na ke baraabar bhartiya khariddaar aate hai
 The situation in entire Nepal can be ascertained from Birgunj, located on the indo-nepal border
 nepal main ab sirf 100 rupee ke bhartiya note hi maanya hai
 Indian citizens who go shopping in Nepal do not carry more than hundred hundred notes with them
 wo ek seemaa tak hi aise note le jate hai
 Brajesh Aggarwal, who runs a shop in Birganj, says that we are only taking 100K notes
 baaki bhartiya note nahin chalane kii vajah se vyapaar band he
 Those coming to Nepal will have to follow the rules

 He hoped that there would be a lot of demand for Nepalese liquor in Bihar on this new year, but this decision of demonetisation has dashed his hopes
 ab bihar se kaaphi kam sankhya main log nepal sharaab kharidne pahunch rahe hai
 Liquor wholesaler Ramdhar Prasad Saraf says that the impact of the closure of a big note is, whichever man comes here to take the goods, he comes with a big note and we have started having problems here
 bade note yahaan gaiyrkanoonee ho gaye hai
 Due to this, our business has also reduced slightly
 bihar main sharabbandi se hamaara vyapaar badha tha, lekin notebandi se yah prabhavit hua he
 The business is losing up to 25 percent
 nepal bharat sahyog manch ke rashtriya adhyaksh ashok kumaar vaidya ne kaha, 'nepal sarkaar saal 2020 ko paryaton varsh ghoshit kar rakhaa he, jis par ab prabhaav padegaa
 i have not yet understood why the Government of Nepal has taken this step
 iske liye vaikalpik upaay sarkaar ko khojna chahie, varanaa iske andar aam janata ko khaas karke madhyam varg or nimna varg kii janata ko bahut dikkat jhelni padegi
 Nepal government suddenly imposed ban on large Indian currency, he said, on December 10, the cabinet of Nepal government suddenly decided that Indian currency of two thousand, five hundred and two hundred will no longer run in Nepal
 sarkaar ne yah faisla kyon liya, iske bare main usne janata ko nahin bataaya
 Even those who already have these Indian rupees did not give any time to change them
 saath hi yah kaha ki jinke paas do hajaar paanch sau or do sau ke bhartiya rupee honge, unhen jail ho jaaegi
 After this decision of the government, intensive checking was also carried out by Nepal guards on the border with India and those who found these Indian rupees were sent to jail
 nepal ke vanijyik sangh bhi hairaananepal ke udyog vaanijya sangh bhi sarkaar ke is faisle se bhuchakka he
 Why the government took this decision is beyond comprehension
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he kibharat main notebandike dauraan ek hajaar or paanch sau ke noton ko avaidh ghoshit kiya gaya tha, us samay se nepal main kaaphi rupaya notebandi ke chakkar main fansaa padaa he
 The Government of Nepal has repeatedly pressured the Government of India to change these notes, but India is not ready to change
 bharat kaa kahana he ki usne hameshaa nepal ko sau-sau ke note hi die hai
 In Nepal earlier there were Indian banknotes of thousand and five hundred rupees
 aise main unako badla nahin ja saktaa hai
 Om Prakash Sharma, president of the industry commerce association Birganj, says that earlier even the Nepal government had banned the old Indian note of thousand and five hundred, but allowed to carry up to 25 thousand rupees, but this time nothing like this Due to this, Nepal's economy will suffer up to 90 percent loss
 bharat ke logon ko keval 10 pratishat nuksaan hi uthaanaa padegaa
 Obviously, Nepal is suffering more losses due to the imprisonment in Indian notekey Nepal
 kanoon ke dar se koi bhi bade bhartiya note nepal lekar nahin ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is a huge impact on the business there
 nepal main paryaton aay kaa ek bahut bada saadhan he
 If Indian tourists do not go, then it will definitely affect Nepal's economy

 ' ek abhootpurv kadam uthaate hue dilli cabinet ne aaj prastaav paarit kar mulya-vardhit kar (waite) ayukta ko adhikarmukt karne ke up-rajyapal najeeb jang ke adhikaar ko chunauti di
 The Delhi government says that the VAT commissioner was targeted because he was fighting 'corruption'
 cabinet ne 'raajnneetik atyaachaar' se naukarshahon ko bachaane ke liye ek mantri-samooh bhi gathit kiya
 In the first resolution passed in the cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Jung was asked to clarify the 'binding conditions' due to which the VAT commissioner was relieved of the post
 cabinet ne waite ayukta ke pad se vijay kumaar kaa 'achaanak, bina bataae' tabadalaa karne par gahari chintaa jataai or aarope lagaaya ki ek antarrashtriya food chen or raajnneetik rup se prabhaavshaalee ek automobile dealer ke khilaaf karrwai karne par unka tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 The cabinet proposal claimed that several senior officials told the government that the Lt
 Governor called them and said that if they did not participate in the exercise to disrupt the functioning of the administration, serious consequences would be suffered and the police action would also be threatened

 Rejecting these allegations, the Lt

 The cabinet has asked the Lt
 Governor four questions whether it is true that he called Kumar after passing the discharge order and threatened him to leave Delhi immediately
 yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya kumaar ko vimukt karne ko lekar unhen piemo yaa grih mantralay se koi likhit yaa maukhik nirdesh praapt hue the
 In the second resolution, the cabinet decided to set up a GOM that would protect officials from political tyranny

 There is all-round pressure on the Modi government from inside the house that the law should be brought in the house for the construction of the Voram temple and clear the way for the construction of the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi in Ayodhya
 is sambhaavna par antim mohar lagi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke vijaydashami kaarykram menmohan bhagwatke bayaan se
 The Sangh chief said in his address that a law should be made for the Ram temple
 agar bhagwat yah baat kah rahe hai to wo ek tarah se sidhe sarkaar ko ishaara kar rahe hai ki sangh or bhaajapa ke samarthakon or ram ke prati aasthaa rakhane waalon kii bhaawanaaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue modi sarkaar ko sadan main ram mandir ke liye kaanoon laana chahie
 The pressure on the Modi government to build the temple is no less
 zamin par kaaryakartaaon or matadaataaon ko jawaab dene se lekar khud ko mandir nirmaan ke liye patibaddh dikhaanaa bhaajapa ke liye zaruri hota ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the saints have started to surround the government on the issue that they will not tolerate delay in temple construction
 santon kaa kahana he ki kya bhaajapa mandir nirmaan kaa apana vaada bhul gai he or kyon supreme court ke faisle ke intazaar kaa bayaan party kii ore se baar-baar diya ja rahaa he
 Keep in mind that a large section of saints and Mahants associated with the Ram temple movement have announced the construction of the temple in Ayodhya from 6 December this year
 sant samaaj kaa kahana he ki wo mandir nirmaan kaa kaam shuru kar denge, sarkaar rokna chaahati he to roke
 This call of saints is no less challenging for the government
 centre kii modi sarkaar or rajya main yogi sarkaar ke liye yah bahut mushkil hoga ki santon ko rokane ke liye ve kisi bhi prakaar kaa bal prayog karen
 This may cause the BJP to suffer considerable losses among its supporters
 sant samaaj kii is ghoshnaa ko sangh pramukh ke aaj ke bhaashan se ek tarah kii vaidhata mil gai he
 The Sangh has made it clear that it does not want to wait for the decision of the court for the Ram temple and the government should bring a law for this and clear the way for the temple construction
 sarkaar laaegi vidheyak?aisi sthiti main bhaajapa ke paas ab ek hi rasta bachataa nazar aa rahaa he or wo yah he ki ram mandir ke prati apni patibaddhta ko sthapit karne ke liye modi sarkaar sadan ke aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr main ram mandir ke vidheyak ko rakhe
 BJP also benefits from this
 pehla to yah ki sarkaar logon ke bich chunaav se thik pehle yah sthapit karne main safal hogi ki unki manshaa ram mandir ke prati kya he
 She will be able to tell her voters that at least BJP and Modi are committed to building Ram temple in Ayodhya
 doosraa laabh yah he ki vipaksh ke liye yah ek sahaj sthiti nahin hogi
 Opposition will break this
 congress ke liye yah aasaan nahin hoga ki wo ram mandir par prastaav kaa virodh karke apni soft hindutv kii puri koshishon ko mitti main mila de
 This will also cause a split in the opposition and there will be a dent in the vote bank of parties like SP BSP
 dhyaan rahe ki santon or matadaataaon ke bich sandesh dene ke liye chunaav se thik pehle modi sarkaar ke saamne yah ek ahm or antim mauka he
 Even during the Kumbh starting in Prayag from January, the government will have to clarify its accountability to the temple in front of the Sant Samaj
 modi sarkaar ke liye aagaamee sheetakaaleen satr is sarkaar kaa antim satr hoga
 The subsequent budget session will end with a mid-term budget and the country will enter the general election
 chunaav se thik pehle apane matadaataaon ke bich ram mandir ke liye vishwaas jataana sarkaar ke liye zaruri he
 It remains to be seen how far the government goes to show this belief
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne kaha he ki 26 may ko narendra modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke do saal puure hone se pehle bahupratikshit nai shiksha niti kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 In response to a question asked on the completion of two years of the NDA government during a recent program, he said, the National Education Policy will be before the nation by 26 May
 unhone kaha, nai shiksha niti ke tahat, ensiiarti shiksha vyavastha ke sammukh sabhi chunautiyon kaa samaadhaan karegaa
 He also said that these challenges have to be resolved because even the students say that they know more about Renaissance i
e
 Renaissance rather than Maharana Pratap
 samprag sarkaar dwaara skulon main 8veen kaksha tak pariksha main kisi ko fail nahin karne sambandhi niti par unhone kaha ki samiksha kii ja rahi he or faisla liya jayega
 He said, because of the policy of not failing anyone, students in class nine are not ready to compete

 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting Gujarat today
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or netanyahu ne ahmedabad airport se sabarmati ashram tak road sho kiya, iske baad donon netaaon ne ashram kaa daura bhi kiya
 The Israeli PM paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and also followed the charkha

 During the time when the Israeli PM was sitting on the ground driving Gandhi's spinning wheel, his wife Sara was also with Netanyahu
 piem modi lagaataar unhen charakhe kaa mahatv bataa rahe the
 While the Israeli PM and his wife were standing after the spinning wheel, PM Modi helped his wife Sara stand up
 or haath badhaakar unhen sahaara diya
 This is the historic visit of the PM of Israel
 charkha chalaane ke baad donon desh ke netaaon ne patang bhi udayi, piem modi ne is dauraan patang ke bare main bhi samajhaayaa
 Let us tell you that after the Sabarmati Ashram, both these leaders will address the Business Summit in the evening
 yah duusari baar he jab piem modi kisi videshi netaa ke saath road sho kiya ho
 Earlier, the Prime Minister had a roadshow with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe

 ' As soon as the UP elections are near, the politics regarding Ram temple has intensified

 By the way, the BJP starts remembering Ram and Ayodhya as soon as the elections come closer
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bijepi ke ghoshnaptr main ram mandir kaa zikr tha
 But with the passage of the election, the issue of Ram temple became a bit lost
 vaise pichley kuch chunaavon par najar daalen to saaf ho jaataa he kiraam mandir nirmaan kaa masalaupi chunaav main ab praasangik nahin rah gaya he
 When Lal Krishna Advani, who was the face of the Ram Mandir movement, became the PM candidate in the 2009 general election, the BJP could get only 10 seats in UP
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ayodhya seat par pehali baar samaajawaadee party ne kabja kiya jabaki is seat par 1991 se bijepi kaa hi ummidavaar jeetta aa rahaa tha
 This was an indication that UP cannot win in Ayodhya if BJP only raises the issue of Ram temple
 saal 2012 main hue upi vidhansabha chunaav mensamajawaadee partiko prachand bahumat mila
 The Samajwadi Party has 224 mlas in the UP Legislative Assembly with 403 seats, followed by Bahujan Samaj Party 80, followed by Bharatiya Janata Party with 47 mlas
 jahaan tak ayodhya seat kaa sawaal he to yahaan se samaajawaadee party ke tej narayan pandeya urf pawan pandeya ne pichhali baar chunaav jeeta tha
 Pawan Pandey was also rewarded for winning a seat that had been considered a BJP stronghold for decades when CM Akhilesh Yadav made him a minister
 vaise ayodhya upi ke faijabad jile main padataa he
 Apart from Ayodhya, the district has Bikapur and Gosainganj assembly seats
 ayodhya se satee bikapur vidhansabha seat par 2012 ke chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke tikat par mitrasen yadav vijayi rahe the
 He defeated Lallu Singh of BJP
 beete saal unke nidhan ke baad is seat par hue upachunaav main samaajawaadee party ne mitrasen yadav ke bete ko tikat diya jo vijayi rahe
 The Gosainganj assembly seat adjacent to Ayodhya is also occupied by the Samajwadi Party
 beete chunaav main yahaan se abhaya singh vijayi rahe the
 Abhay Singh defeated Indra Pratap of BSP
 iske alaava milkipur seat se samaajawaadee party ke avadhesh prasad, haidargarh seat se sapa ke ram magan, katehari seat se samaajawaadee party ke shankh laal maanjhi, tanda se sapa ke ajimullah haq pahalwaan, alapur se sapa ke bhim prasad sonkar, jalalpur se sapa ke sher bahadur, akbarpur se sapa ke ramamurti verma vidhayak hai

 Manish Tiwari sought clarification from the Central Government on the matter and said that it is not the habit of the Congress to do it
 congress netaa pisi chaako ne ise tathyon kii galat vyakhya bataaya or kaha ki nehru or bose donon desh ko samarpit the or unki ranneeti alag thi
 The government may have monitored Subhas Chandra Boseke's family to look after them, but the government had no hostile motive

 This was the responsibility of the government
 nehru kaa subhash chandra bose or unke parivaar ke prati shatrutapurna ravaiya nahin tha
 i think this story is the result of misinterpretation

 nariman ne kadi tippanee karte hue kaha ki supreme court kaa faisla maamne ke liye sabhi baadhya hai or iskaa paalan karne ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he

 justise nariman ne kaha ki sangathit rup se court ke faisle kaa virodh bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Justice Nariman and Justice DY Chandrachud wanted to dismiss the petitions

 These judges believed that the decision of Sabarimala would affect the traditions of other religions as well, hence it should be widely seen
 bench ke anya sadasyon kaa maananaa tha ki masjidon main mahilaon ke pravesh se lekar lite tower main parsi mahilaon ke pravesh ko bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie
 This is the reason that the big bench of the court will take all these issues and give a comprehensive verdict on the necessary beliefs, till then the issue has been kept pending
 court ne badi bench kaa faisla aane tak mahilaon kii entry par ste lagane se inkaar bhi kar diya kyonki pehle bhi adaalat mahilaon ko sabarimala mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat de chuki he
 The decision was not implemented properly
 The Supreme Court had allowed women to enter the temple in September last year, despite this, very few women have not been able to enter the temple
 ise lekar mandir trust or raajnneetik dalon ke bich ekarey bhi nahin ban pai
 While the Kerala government made elaborate security arrangements for the entry of women, violence was also witnessed in many areas due to opposition from the followers of Lord Ayyappa
 kerala kii udief sarkaar or bijepi ke bich is mudde par khub siyaasi ghamaasan dekhne ko mila or donon hi dal ek-duusare ko hinsa kaa jimmedaar bataate aae hai
 Why ban the entry of women? Please tell that the entry of women between the age of 10 years and 50 years was prohibited in the Sabarimala temple
 yahaan kii parampara ke anusaar mana jaataa tha ki bhagwaan ayappa brahmacharee the or jo mahilaayein rajaswala hoti hai, unhen mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat nahin di jaani chahie
 a petition was filed against this tradition in the Supreme Court

 tula raashi- is raashi ke bachche bahut chanchal or udaar swabhaav ke hote hai har sthiti main ghul mil jate hai or sab chizon ko sweekaar kar lete hai

 - Input from IANS pashchim bengal sarkaar mangalvaar ko singoor bill ko vidhansabha main pesh karne ja rahi he
 Under this bill, the government will take back 997 acres of land given to Tata Motors to build a Nano plant in Singur and 400 acres of it will be returned to the farmers against whom it was against the land
 in kisaanon ne zamin ke badale sarkari muawza lene se manaa kar diya tha
 Mamta's important election promise was that she would return her 400 acres of land to the farmers, so her cabinet took the first decision on Singur as soon as she came into government
 tata se zamin waapas lene ke baad use muawza diya jayega jo hughali ke zila jaj tay karenge
 After returning 400 acres of land to the farmers, the remaining 597 acres of land will be used by the government for setting up industries and other socio-economic development works

 Nirmala again retaliated on the frequent attacks by the opposition parties and said that the opposition was spreading misinformation on the Rafael deal, as well as the question whether they had become puppets in the corporate rivalry or 36 fighter Trying to damage the purchase of the jet

 The ruling party is trying to fill the ballot box in its favor by roasting the spirit of nationalism for victory
 is vishay par shaayad hi kabhi ek upanyaas kii avadharana ban sake
 Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey have mastered this political art for years
 jabaki is saal matadaataaon kii badhati berukhi ke sanket saaf taur par mili hai
 If you don't have answers to voters' questions about broken promises or unfulfilled expectations, what better way to avoid answering by wrapping yourself in the national flag and declaring yourself the sole protector
 yah ek ranneetik abhiyaan he jisamen sainya shakti kaa istemaal aantarik or bahari dushmano ke khilaaf karke or logon main bhay paidaa karke matadaataaon ke bich vibhaajan ko prerit kiya jaataa he
 As Charles de Gaulle said, "patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first, nationalism is when hatred for people other than your own comes first
 "iske mul main chuphi bhaavana yahi he ki aam chunaav main faisla is baat par hoga ki kya matadaata pradhanmantri modi ko andeh kaa laabh denge or unhen is tarah ek or kaarykaal mil jayega
 Knowing this, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has focused its entire campaign on Modi's personality
 unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa he jo aprihaary hai or jinka koi vikalp nahin he
 Without which there will be neither India's security, nor economic development
 isliye ise 'modi shining' abhiyaan kaha jaae
 During the 2014 elections, the BJP considered Modi a favorable candidate under the circumstances in whose name voters could be wooed and a record majority
 bijepi ne na sirf ise kar dikhaaya balki uttar or pashchim bharat kii siton par usne baari antar se ekatarfa jeet hasil kii
 He won many seats with more than two lakh votes
 voton kaa vah margin is samay kaam aayega kyonki rashtriya pravriti is baar saamaanya ho jaaegi
 In 2014, due to Modi wave, the election ground was very attractive for BJP, while this time the opposition is more united
 aise main vah satta virdohi prabhaav ke maddenjar balakot or pulavama ke sandarbhon ko lekar in chunaavon ko apane paksh main kritrim rup se badalane kii koshish main juty he
 90% of the media is with BJP, which is trying to create a small wave to help Modi
 haalanki yah bharat ke matadaataaon ke aakaar or jatilta ke drushtigat itani aasaani se puraa nahin ho saktaa he
 What was seen in the last five years, the media's unflinching story of the election in the eyes of the voters is dramatically reduced credibility
 mujhe andeh he ki modi ke jayakaaron ke bich jamini patrakaron ko modi virdohi awaajon ko pahachaanakar santulan banaae rakhane main mushkilen saamne aa rahi hai
 After seeing the attack on Arvind Kejriwal in broad daylight in the country's capital under the police's nose, anti-modi voters have become 'yeti' for journalists, who are finding it difficult to find
 ve matdaan centre par hi bolenge
 CM Arvind Kejriwal was slapped during a roadshow in Delhi
 pulavama hamale ke baad upje aakrosh ke baavjood, 26 / 11 ke hamale ko lekar dehshat kii waisi koi maujuudagi nahin he, jo haal ke hamale ke baad srilanka main vyaapt he
 PM has tried in this election story through Pakistan for the benefit
 haalanki imran khan ne farji tareeke se girakar bijepi ko chunavi phayda dene ke liye khud ko musharraf kii tarah khalanaayak ke rup main pesh kiya
 Propaganda has been capped in support of Modi over Balakot and Pulwama, which could have encouraged pro-modi voters and disputed party cadres after the three states lost elections in December
 yah koi choti baat nahin he, lekin chunavi game-changer bhi nahin he, jo ki kuch suzav de rahaa he
 Also, to benefit from the spirit of nationalism after Balakot, it has been beneficial for us to have a quicker and faster election program rather than the miserable long and never ending electoral program
 mujhe andeh he ki punjab, haryana or purvi uttar pradesh main 19 may ko atyadhik taapmaana vaali garmi main badi sankhya main voter ghar se nikal sakenge or rashtravaadi bhaavana matadaataaon ke dimag par haaavee rah sakegi
 Pakistan has been at the center of the bjp's election campaign
 party kaa kahana he ki usne jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi shivi par hawaii hamale kaa aadesh dekar paak ko sabak sikhaaya
 As the BJP has done, relying almost entirely on the propaganda of the message of the nationalist campaign is a very risky strategy
 yadi yah asar kar gaya, to paryaapt chunavi phayda mil saktaa he; haalanki, agar tir galat nishane par laga, to iskaa utana hi ulta prabhaav bhi sambhav he
 Last week, a video of the current MP from West Delhi went viral
 is video main jab ek matadaata ne saansad se unke record par sawaal uthaaya to unhone iske jawaab main "bharat mata kii jai!" kaa naaraa lagaaya
 Earlier, bjp's 'mascot' Anupam Kher had resorted to the same slogan, defending the question of journalists about the record of his MP wife in Chandigarh
 is jabardast or besangi ranneeti se bijepi ke voter santusht ho sakate hai lekin chunavi nattejey tay karne vaala asthir voter chizon ko bahut alag tarah se dekh saktaa he
 Then we have the Prime Minister himself, who is deliberately putting a dozen insulting charges on the nearest opposition leader
 yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki ve kis rajya main hote hai
 They are even trying to appropriate the post of commander-in-chief
 unase "achche din", naukari, notebandi yaa anya aise maarmik vishyon par koi baat nahin kii ja sakati he, jo ki matadaataaon ke liye vaastavik hit ke mudde ho sakate hai
 His confidence and stature increased with each successive phase of the 2014 election
 is chunaav main ulta ho rahaa he
 He made a strong start to Balakot later, but later his speeches showed frustration
 beete saptahanth main to ve vastav main rajeev gandhi kii hatya kaa bhi majaak udaate hue dikhaai die
 It is difficult to see how the PM thought it would be in bjp's interest to insult Rajiv Gandhi in Pratapgarh, a neighboring parliamentary constituency, two days before polling in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the safe and traditional strongholds of the Gandhi family
 spasht rup se yah baari bhul he jo tab hui he jab rashtravaadi maansikta kaa anargal aalaap joro se kiya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that Rajiv Gandhi's life came to an end as 'corrupt number one'
 netanyahu or erdogan ne majboot rashtriya arthvyavasthaaon ko aadhaar banaakar apni rashtravaadi raajnneeti ko chamkaaya
 This brought him into the role of a strong player among the voters and made him credible
 november 2016 main modi ne achaanak desh kaa bhagya vidhaataa banakar notebandi kaa faisla liya lekin iske baavjood jetali ne hamen vishwaas dilaayaa he ki hamaari arthvyavastha us samay se mandi kii chapet main he
 The rural economy and the unorganized sector are yet to recover

 The fall of Jet Airways during the election, poor corporate earnings, the ever-increasing NBFC crisis and the possibility of rising oil prices are all issues that the next government will have to face
 yadi 23 may ke baad in pareshaaniyon ko dur karnaa he to bharat ko ek team ke rup main kaam karne vaale sakasham mantriyon ke cabinet kii jarurat hogi
 The BJP was in trouble due to its ability in its ranks

 Due to this, the Youth Congress workers gathered in front of the Reserve Bank of India office at 12 o'clock at night to celebrate it as a black day on the completion of one year of demonetisation
 congress kaaryakartaaon ne notebandi ke virodh main naare likhi takhtiyaan haath main lekar pradarshan kiya

 Congress workers said that this is the dark day of Indian democracy

 At 30th, Sehwag has an innings of 319 runs against South Africa in Chennai, while at 41st, he has a 309-run historic innings in Multan which he played against Pakistan in 2004
 gauratlab he ki bharat kii ore se itihaas main keval do baar tihare test shatak bane hai, or donon hi virendra sahvaag ke balle se nikle
 Next on the list is 44th ranked India's 'mr

 The stories of this 36-year-old Sughdar Natani, who has been missing for two weeks, and her lavish lifestyle, have now come on people's tongues
 uske pati amarchand rajnat ne ab pradesh ke swasthya mantri or jat lobby ke shashakt netaa mahipal maderna par sidhe-sidhe aarope madha he
 "maderna used to call his wife at my house
 hamane kaha bhi ki saab ham chote aadmi hai, hamen kyon pareshaan karte ho?'' apni gardan funsane kaa andeshaa dikhte hi gahalot ne apratyaashit teji dikhaate hue maamla sibiai ko saunp diya
 State Home Minister Shanti Dhariwal, however, said that with Maderna's consent, the matter has been referred to the CBI
 par yah sabhi ke liye chaunkaane vaala tha kyonki jodhpur ke iji umesh mishra kii aguai main police bhavari ke apharan ke liye lagaae gaye logon ko pakad chuki thi
 One of them, Ashok, was caught from Ramgarh in Sikar district
 ab police bhavari yaa uski laash kii talash main thi
 Instead of waiting for a few more days, Gehlot handed the case over to the CBI
 yahaan bataa den ki bhavari jodhpur ke bilada kshetra ke jaaliwada khurd up-swasthya centre par eenem thi
 There she just went to sign
 kisi kii majaal nahin hui ki use koi pareshaan kare
 The Jodhpur police is sure that Bhanwari was called by Sohanlal Vishnoi, the contractor of the health department
 vah congress vidhayak malakhan singh kaa rishtedaar or divangat congress netaa ramsingh vishnoi kaa betaa he, jinhen gahalot ne apane pichley kaarykaal main mantri pad se hataa diya tha
 One of his sons was caught running an illegal drug factory
 police sutron ke mutabik hiraasat main liya gaya vyakti yah nahin ugal rahaa he ki usne bhavari ko maaraa he yaa nahin par ek police afasar ke mutabik, ''sohanlal or is shaks ne kuch nirnaayak suraag die hai, jo kisi visidi se maamle ke taar jodate hai
 Once the kidnappers confessed to burying the corpse near Jhansi, but a pond came out there
 idhar rajasthan ke khaskar marwar ilaake main har koi bhavari or uske kaamkaaj ke bare main ab zyada se zyada jaananaa chahta he
 That is why he has also started selling the songs of the songs in which Bhanwari has acted
 jodhpur ke shrikrishna casets kaa banaaya album kunwar tejaji jamkar bik rahaa he
 The Ram Bharosa cart and the new Jaun Sasariya are also very much discussed
 in albamon ke jariye log bhavari ko kareeb se dekhne-jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Bhanwari and Maderna had been discussing the VCD for months and Gehlot was also indicated
 is par maderna ko unhone satark rahane ko kaha tha bataate hai
 i do not know whether it is a VCD or that it is a propaganda to degrade Maderna
 gahalot to vaise isse khush hi honge kyonki isse unhen unke pita parsaram maderna se hisaab chuktaa karne kaa mauka milegaa, jinhone gahalot ko mukhyamantri banaae jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 Bhanwari's phone details show that she used to talk to many people
 inhen main nagaur kaa bhi ek shaks tha, jo poochtacha ke liye aane main hichak rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the police are not looking at the call details of Bhanwari's previous years, which may indicate whether Maderna was in touch with him
 kol detel agar ek farji muthbhed maamle main ediji arvind jain or purv mantri rajendra rathod ke khilaaf paryaapt saboot de dete hai to phir is maamle main police kol detel ke byoron ke bare main chuppi kyon saadhe hue he? sandigdh kai dinon se uske kabje main hai
 In this case, sufficient effective evidence can be extracted from them
 behatar hota ki gahalot apni police se peshewar dhang se isaki jaanch karaate or kisi nattejey par pahunchate
 But it seems that as usual, he is more concerned about political results
 maamla sibiai ko dekar unhone jat matadaataaon se apni tatasthta jaahir karne kii koshish kii he, jiske ki maderna pratinidhi hai
 But the encirclement of one of his ministers in this way also questions his chief ministership
