 In Maharashtra, BJP and Shiv Sena have once again entered into an alliance
 18 farvari kii donon partiyon kii ghoshnaa sirf loksabhaa chunaav 2019 tak hi simit nahin he balki ye gathbandhan is saal ke ant main hone vaale maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhi rahegaa
 Significantly, the alliance of BJP and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has been since 1989 Lok Sabha elections and since then till 2014 Lok Sabha elections, both parties contested every Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the state but both contested separate elections in 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections Were
 aakhir aisi kya vajah thi ki donon alag-alag chunaav lade vidhansabha main or ab ek baar phir se 2019 ke chunaav main gathbandhan main ladenge? ek or bada sawaal yah bhi he ki haal ke dinon main jaisi talkhi shivasena kii taraf se dikhaai ja rahi thi achaanak vahi shivasena, bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan ke liye raji kaise ho gayi? kya bhaajapa or shivasena kaa gathbandhan donon kii majaburi thi? in sawaalon kaa jawaab unke puraane gathbandhan ke ganit main chipa he
 Of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, BJP will contest 25 and Shiv Sena on the remaining 23
 2014 main jahaan ramdaas athawale kii RPI(A) ko bhi ek seat di gai thi, unhen is baar NDA gathbandhan main koi seat nahin mili he
 The great thing is that Shiv Sena has got 23 seats, the highest in terms of seats it has got so far
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav se bhi teen seat adhik or kisi bhi loksabhaa chunaav se ek seat adhik
 Chart 1: The number of seats contested by BJP and Shiv Sena in various Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra
 This chart shows that BJP has always contested more seats than Shiv Sena but this is exactly opposite in assembly elections, Whereas since 1990, Shiv Sena has been contesting more seats than BJP
 chart-2 : maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa or shivasena dwaara ladi gai sitenyani maharashtra main bhaajapa or shivasena ke lambey chale gathbandhan kaa mul mantra yah tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa gathbandhan main bada bhai rahegi or vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena ye bhoomika adaa karegi
 But this trend broke in the 2014 assembly elections
 is tut kii badi vajah yah thi ki amit shah ke netritv main bhaajapa maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main bhi gathbandhan ke bade bhai kii bhoomika chaahati thi
 Its scale BJP wanted to make the 2014 Lok Sabha election result which was rejected by the Shiv Sena because it accepted the old formula of alliance
 baharhaal donon partiyaan vidhansabha main alag-alag chunaav ladiin or bhaajapa ek badi party banakar ubhari lekin akele bahumat kaa aankada nahin chhu pai
 Why did it happen that despite the recent Modi wave, the BJP could not touch the majority in the state and once again agreed to an alliance with the Shiv Sena? In fact, the BJP and Shiv Sena alliance is their compulsion in the state
 lambey samay se ek saath chunaav ladane kii vajah se unke bich na sirf siton kii sankhya lagbhag tay hoti thi (kuch ko chhod kar) balki koun si seat kis party ke khate main jaati he yah bhi lagbhag tay rahata tha
 Because of this, the workers and organizations of both the parties remained strong in their assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies, but the base was reduced in those areas where the candidates of the allied party are in the elections
 udhaaharan ke liye agar rajya ke 2014 vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam dekhen to jis loksabhaa kshetra se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar chunaav maidan main hote the unamem aane vaaleen 163 main se 149 par bhaajapa 35 pratishat vot ke saath 81 siten jeetne main safal rahi lekin un 119 siton par jahaan shivasena chunaav ladaa karti thi unamem se 111 par bhaajapa chunaav ladi or sirf 41 siten jeet pai
 It also had only 26 percent of the vote in these areas
 lagbhag yahi haal shivasena kaa bhi rahaa
 In the Lok Sabha seats where Shiv Sena contests, Shiv Sena got 26 percent votes in the assembly seats falling under it, while in other seats their vote was 10 percent less
 2014 kaa vidhansabha chunaav parinaam bhaajapa or shivasena ke liye ek aaine kii tarah tha, donon partiyaan us aaine main apni-apni tasviir dekh chuki hai
 In the 2019 battle, they have a coalition of Congress and NCP
 unase takkar main bijepi akele ladane kaa khatra mol nahin le sakati thi or isi ke parinamswaroop unhen shivasena ko pichley saal ke muqaabale adhik siten deni padin or sambhawatah donon ko gathbandhan ke apane puraane formule par waapas aana padaa

 He said that here too posts will be divided between JDU and BJP based on the number of mlas

 Majrooh, who wrote amazing songs for films, was fond of shero-shayari since childhood and had become an important part of Ilakai Mushayars at an early age, but he did not like the film world

 Majrooh Sultanpuri turned down Kardar Saheb's offer because he considered writing a song for films for a poet not considered a good thing
 jigar muradaabadi ne majaruuh sultanpuri ko tab salaah di ki filmon ke liye geet likhnaa koi buree baat nahin he
 Some of the money they get from writing the song can be sent for their family's expenses
 jigar muradaabadi kii salaah par majaruuh sultanpuri filmon main geet likhane ke liye raji ho gaye
 For composer Naushad, he wrote the first song 'gesu bichhaye, Badal aaye jhoom ke', took a different path in the film world

 Majrooh Sultanpuri wrote 4000 songs for nearly 300 films in a cine career spanning over four decades before saying goodbye to this world on May 25, 2000
 saal 1964 main pradarshit film ‘dosti’ ke ‘chaahunga main tuje sanjh savere’ geet ke liye vah sarvshereshth geetkaar ke ‘film fere’ puraskaar se bhi navaaje gaye
 Majrooh Sultanpuri was awarded the highest honor of Indian cinema 'dada Saheb Phalke' in the year 1993 for his great contribution in the film world

 kaushal vikaas mantri rajeev pratap rudi, jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga safai mantri uma bharti or kendriya shram evam rojgaar mantri bandaaru dattatreya jaise bade naam hai
 All these three names were also associated with the field of employment and employment generation as the special ministry for Uma Bharti was expected to generate huge amount of employment in the country for cleaning Ganga

 Prime Minister Modi was also unhappy with the success graph of Uma Bharti, Minister of Water and Ganga Ministry
 pichley teen saal main ganga safai par sirf nammaatr ke hi kaam hue the
 Along with Uma Bharti, junior minister Sanjeev Balyan has also been shown the way out of the cabinet while he was looking after the work of this ministry for the last one year

 According to reports, big names like Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Women Welfare Minister Maneka Gandhi are discussed in some such names

 pradesh main kanoon kaa raaj hoga
 But when the legislators are sitting as their own goons, how will the rule of law be established
 bijepi vidhayak par rape or hatya kaa aarope laga
 The police could not muster the courage to lay hands on them
 ladki rape kaa daawa karti he to karti rahe
 BJP mlas were free even today and are still free
 sarkaar apni he
 The power is its own
 ab bhala police vaale haath kaise daale
 But the government has its own helplessness
 svachh chhavi kaa sawaal jo he, to karrwai ho bhi rahi he
 The mla's brothers are behind bars
 vardeevaale daud lagaae hue hai
 In secretariat the files are flying gallop
 jaanch nishpaksh dikhe isliye SIT bhi gathan kar diya gaya
 The SIT will investigate whether the rape took place
 peedita ke pita kii castady main maut kaise hui
 Was there a conspiracy? yadi agar sajeesh thi to kya isamen vidhayak ji shaamil the yaa nahin
 The Chief Minister had already given the trust of justice to the victim
 ab siem sahab ne aaj shaam tak esaiti ko report saunpane ko kaha he
 The SIT team is reaching Unnao today
 mukhyamantri ne aaj shaam tak pehali report saunp degi
 Unnao's police was also investigating for 11 months
 ab SIT jaanch karegi
 Leave the arrest of MLA unase ab tak poochtacha bhi nahin hui
 He was accused of rape
 hatya karwaane kaa aarope laga, lekin chehre par ab tak koi shikan tak nahin he
 He was cool even today, he is still cool
 system ke jeb main hone kaa bharosa to dekhie
 Uncle of the victim girl did not even shudder to give advice to forget all
 usko phone par dhamkee de daali
 This MLA, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, says, 'finish the whole battle
 tum hamaare paas aao, ham tum milakar nayaa adhyay shuru karte hai
 'BJP MLA is desperate to write a new chapter, but the previous book of accounts has not been closed yet
 uskaa hisaab koun karegaa
 First of all let it be accounted
 ek ladki se rape or uske pita kii hatya karaane kaa hisaab
 The question is that if the MLA is so truthful then why would he want to silence the aggrieved family
 kyon camere par jaanch kii baat karte hai or parde ke peeche cese khatm karaane kii setting karte hai
 This haste by MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is opening his pole
 lekin upi police ko ye dikhataa nahin he
 How will this look to the UP police, who have accurate information about profit loss? aakhir maamla sattadhari party ke vidhayak kaa jo he
 In this case, taking automatic cognizance of the media report, the Commission has summoned a detailed report from the Chief Secretary of the state and the DGP of Uttar Pradesh
 iske saath hi report main ye bhi jaankaree dene ko kaha he ki un police karmiyon ke khilaaf kya karrwai hui, jinhone exiaar darj karne se inkaar kiya tha
 The Commission has said that the DGP reports that why the report of death in judicial custody was not given to the Commission within 24 hours? The health report of the deceased has also been sought in this case, when he was detained in jail
 iske saath hi poocha gaya ki jail prashasan kii taraf se uskaa kya upachaar kiya gaya
 These reports have to be sent to the Commission within four weeks
 aaj aapse ek baat kehani he
 Are you changing according to news channels or media? On the next day, low level political statements of leaders are discussed
 kahin aisa to nahin ki inhen charchaaon ko aap khabar yaa soochna samaj rahe hai, kya in charchaaon se aapako system kii paardarshita nazar aati he, system jise aap thana, court or afasar samajhate hai, kya aapkaa usame bharosa bad rahaa he
 What happens when you are a victim of a false trial or fight the system over the truth? Many mediums of information have come into your hands, but look closely, most of the information is same
 yah jo ekarupata he darasal yahi suchnaviheenta he
 You have a medium but in the name of information the same Gopal
 inaki itani raily, unke utane bayaan
 The media itself has also weakened and is simultaneously weakening you as well
 naagarik hone kaa matlab he sanvaidhanik adhikaron se las vyakti
 There are many types of institutions in the system for protection
 lekin kya ye sansthaaen aapke adhikaron kaa aadar karti hai? kya aapkaa apane adhikaron par bas he, niyantran he? in adhikaron ke bagair naagarik naagarik nahin rahata, vah loktantr main ek zindaa laash kii tarah ho jaataa he, jo kandhe par apane dastavezon ko laade kabhi police kamishnar to kabhi sampadak to kabhi saansad ke yahaan chakkar lagaate rahata he
 Many such dead bodies are wandering across India
 jhaanv-jhaanv kaanv- kaanv karne vaale amaryadit pravaktaaon ne na sirf itihaas ko footbal kaa khel bana diya he, balki aapke sawaalon se bhi ve footbal samaj kar khelte hai
 i receive many letters every day
 jo pradhanmantri ko bhi likhi hoti hai or raashtrapati ko bhi or mujhe bhi
 Those who write letters often get letters of receipt from the Prime Minister's office and the phone also comes, but nothing happens
 akhir kya baat he ki pradhanmantri karyaalay se phone aane yaa chitthee likhane yaa media main chhapane ke baad bhi system ko fark nahin padataa
 We are starting public hearing in the prime time of such persecuted people of the system
 choti si koshish he ki bakse se bakawaas pravaktaa gaayab ho or aam aadmi ko loktantr main uski jagah mili
 On December 1, while preparing for prime time, 6-7 people from Maharashtra came to meet
 chaar paanch ghante tak meraa intazaar karte rahe ki mil kar hi jaaenge
 When they came to meet him after the program, these people who came to Delhi from Maharashtra did not even know how cold Delhi is
 maamuli thand main bhi hatho main dastaane pahan liye the
 He once spoke to me on the phone, i just said that there are documents in Marathi, i cannot read
 mujhe yakeen nahin hua ki ye mere liye kai dacument hindi main anuwaad kar laae the
 For a year, his news has been published in the English and Marathi newspapers of Maharashtra
 magar iske baad bhi kuch nahin hua
 As these people were taking out photo copies of documents from the bag with me, i started looking at them instead
 aap bhi inaki jagah khud ko dekhie
 How terrible that situation will be when four-five people come to Delhi if they do not get justice in Maharashtra, to meet journalists, meet the Prime Minister, meet the ministers
 ab aapako samaj aayaa ki system kaise aapako nihattha or laachaar kar detaa he
 Stuffs your entire life into documents and stuffs it in the bag
 naveen mumbai se aae log haath jodne lage
 The system has made them so insecure that after the son's murder, the parents are watching their killings everyday
 shahji sonaavne ke 15 saal ke bete ko isliye dabangon ne maar diya kyonki usne ek aisi ladki se pyaar kar liya jo uski jati kii nahin thi
 Shahji Sonawane is a Dalit
 aap kahenge ki dalit kyon kaha kyonki honor kiling main jati ek pahalu hoti he
 Therefore, it is important to declare Dalit
 ye sab dastauez jo aap dekh rahe hai, kagaz nahin hai, swapanil kii laash he
 There is a blood in it and Mamta's lawyer husband Amit
 jise ye log thile main bharkar dilli aae hai
 See how lonely the system has made them
 media or system aapako tabhi tak sakasham samajhataa he jab tak aap kisi badi bheed kaa hissaa hote hai
 As soon as they are alone, they start searching for a building of trust
 aae din aisi kahaniyon ko dhote hue log news channelon se lekar tamaam tarah kii sansthaaon ke chakkar lagaate rahete hai
 Most of the time such stories are returned, as the evening of news channels is cut off by absurd statements
 aisi dastaanon ke liye vaaki mehnat kerani padati he
 Hundreds of pages have to be read
 reporter kii zarur padati he jo ab hai nahin
 Only the anchors who have attained the divine status remain
 kai baar in dastavezon ko samajhane or baratane kii yogyata bhi nahin hoti he
 But the common man is in trouble
 isliye kahata hum ki in bahason se aapkaa hameshaa bhala nahin he
 These debates are singling you out
 isiilie media aise logon ko bhaga detaa he
 Not all letters are worth reporting, but what happens is also thrown away
 aise log bina mili bhaga die jate hai
 i can not handle myself
 itane logon se kaise koi mil saktaa he
 That day survived me as it happened, but i want to tell you the story i got
 19 july 2016 kii ghatana he mumbai ke nerul ilaake kii yaheen par state bank of india ke upabhokta sahaayak shahji sonavane ke 15 saal ke bete swapanil sonavane kii hatya hoti he
 According to the father, some boys take Swapnil from home to auto before killing
 uski pitayee karte hai or phir thane le jate hai
 From the police station, the father and mother of Swapinal get information
 inkaa aarope he ki police chaahati to unka betaa mar saktaa tha magar unke anusaar aaropee police ke saamne hi 'sarat' film tu banane kii dhamkee dene lage
 In Sairat too, those who fall in love by breaking caste are killed
 honor kiling kii ghatana ko 16 maheene ho gaye magar peediton ko bharosa nahin he ki unki or unke liye cese lard rahe vakil kii jaan surakshit he
 This incident has been heavily published by the media of Maharashtra
 media ko 15 saal ke ek ladke kii hatya main 'sarat' film kaa doosraa hissaa nazar aayaa magar swapanil ke maa baap abhi tak khud ko nahin samajha paae hai ki samaaj ke kuch tabakon ke paas itani takat kahaan se aa jaati he ki 15 saal ke abodh ladke kii hatya ho jaati he
 Hindustan Times, The Times of India, Mumbai Mirror, Midday, Navbharat Times, Dabang Duniya, Noon Saamna, Vratratna Samrat, Aapal Mahanagar, Mumbai Chaufferay, Sandyakal, Janmabhoomi, Gujarat News, Divya Bhaskar, Sandesh, Indian Express, NDTV, TV9 featured and featured it
 aapane dekha ki kis tarah media kaa asar kamazor hua he or badal main aam aadmi usase bhi zyaada kamazor hua he
 Even after appearing in 20 types of media, their condition is that sometimes they meet the CM and sometimes they petition to meet the Police Commissioner
 kyon kisi ko bhatakana padataa he
 Why cannot there be a professional investigation of these cases at the station level? Is there any political pressure? 13 people were also arrested in this case
 5 alag-alag kaarnon se zamaanat par reeha bhi hue
 The Indian Express has written that government lawyers were changed thrice
 ek saal tak trial hi shuru nahin hua
 The trial was scheduled to begin on November 13, but on November 12, Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband Amit is attacked with a fatal attack
 hamale ke baad trial tal jaataa he
 Advocate Mamta Jadhav becomes so insecure about her husband's safety that she leaves a one and a half year old child in law and comes to Delhi, pleading with the Prime Minister and the President
 uske saath swapanil ke mata-pita bhi bhatak rahe the
 Lawyer Mamta Jadhav's mother-in-law is in the hospital where Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband is admitted
 4 taarikh ko pati kaa oparation ho gaya magar us vakt mamata jaghav dilli main thim
 Mamta told that when she and her husband started fighting the case of the murder of Shah Sonwane's son Swapnil, they started getting attacked
 ye hamale ruuk hi nahin rahe hai or police unhen suraksha nahin de rahi he
 Mamta also went to the Scheduled Castes Commission, also to the Women's Commission
 swapanil ke pita ne mukhyamantri or police kamishnar ko patr likhaa tha ki vakil amit kataranvare ko surajha di jaae
 Security not provided
 mamata ke pati par 5 sitambar or 12 november ko do baar hamalaa hota he
 Security is not provided even after the September 5 attack
 koi giraftaar nahin hoti he
 The attack on 12 November was fatal
 amit ko rod se maaraa gaya
 He broke his head and was crushed
 koi giraftaar nahin hai
 The trial was scheduled to begin on 13 November, postponed following the attack
 mamata chaahati thi ki exiaar main hamale ke liye police kii laaparvaahee ko bhi zimmedaar banaaya jaae
 According to him, the police wanted the name of the police to be removed
 aap is kahani main dekhie ki system ke saamne koun peedit he
 This is public hearing
 pehle log bolenge phir police apana paksh rakhegi to uskaa paksh aapke saamne zarur rakhenge
 This episode does not favor the police who are the victims
 mamata kahati hai ki 12 november ke hamale ke baad exiaar darj karaane gai to patni hote hue bhi unke naam se exiaar darj nahin kii gai
 It is possible that you will find this story boring
 yaad rakhiegaa, jab aap aisi sthiti main aaenge to baaki darshakon or media ko bhi aapaki kahani boring lagegi or iskaa phayda uthaakar system aapako tod degaa
 The comments mamata jadhav ne bataaya ki jab se swapanil kii hatya kaa cese liya he tab se ek hi maheene main unke upar achaanak danaadan exiaar hone lagati he
 Mamata and her husband are accused in an FIR number i396 / 16 on 6 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR number i400 / 16 main mamata or pati amit aaropee banaae jate hai
 On 8 October 2016, Amit and others are charged in the FIR
 9 aktubar 2016 ko bhi do alag-alag FIR darj hoti he
 In one, the husband-wife and in one the husband are accused
 9 aktubar ko ek or FIR pati amit or anya ke khilaaf hoti he
 On October 13 and 14, an FIR is registered against Mamta Jadhav and Amit
 jo vakil hai unke kilaaf achaanak se itane FIR kahaan se aa jate hai
 In many of these, these lawyer spouses are accused of helping to create fake caste certificates
 kya ye saare exiaar in par dabaav banane ke liye kiye gaye? 15 saal ke ek bete kii hatya hoti he, uskaa cese ek vakil ladane ko taiyaar hota he magar aap dekhie ki kabhi mukademe to kabhi hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mamta says that the attackers sometimes take the name of the minister, sometimes the name of the police
 isliye ham apni shikaayat main inhen aaropee banaate hai
 These people have come to Delhi so that Mamta's husband can get protection and there is no attack
 ye log arji banaakar har jagah de rahe hai
 Mamta Jadhav and Swapnil's father and mother have left for Mumbai
 mamata jadhav ne phone par bataaya ki unke pati kii suraksha main hamale ke baad aspataal main kuch suraksha karmi lage the, unhen hataa liya gaya he
 We tried to talk to the police officers but could not speak
 kuch ne phone kaat diya, kuch ne baat taal di
 Now what does this story tell you, how much a weak side has to fight for justice
 system use or kamazor kar detaa he
 During this, how many deaths he dies, in which insecurity lives
 maut ke sadame ke alaava paisa or vakt kaa to hisaab hi nahin
 The son was also killed and those fighting for justice are dying every day
 ho saktaa he ki inke paksh main kami ho lekin kya yah sahi nahin he ki system aadmi ko maar detaa he
 The common man stands unarmed in front of the system
 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie

 akhir kya baat he ki pradhanmantri karyaalay se phone aane yaa chitthee likhane yaa media main chhapane ke baad bhi system ko fark nahin padataa
 We are starting public hearing in the prime time of such persecuted people of the system
 choti si koshish he ki bakse se bakawaas pravaktaa gaayab ho or aam aadmi ko loktantr main uski jagah mili
 On December 1, while preparing for prime time, 6-7 people from Maharashtra came to meet
 chaar paanch ghante tak meraa intazaar karte rahe ki mil kar hi jaaenge
 When they came to meet him after the program, these people who came to Delhi from Maharashtra did not even know how cold Delhi is
 maamuli thand main bhi hatho main dastaane pahan liye the
 He once spoke to me on the phone, i just said that there are documents in Marathi, i cannot read
 mujhe yakeen nahin hua ki ye mere liye kai dacument hindi main anuwaad kar laae the
 For a year, his news has been published in the English and Marathi newspapers of Maharashtra
 magar iske baad bhi kuch nahin hua
 As these people were taking out photo copies of documents from the bag with me, i started looking at them instead
 aap bhi inaki jagah khud ko dekhie
 How terrible that situation will be when four-five people come to Delhi if they do not get justice in Maharashtra, to meet journalists, meet the Prime Minister, meet the ministers
 ab aapako samaj aayaa ki system kaise aapako nihattha or laachaar kar detaa he
 Stuffs your entire life into documents and stuffs it in the bag
 naveen mumbai se aae log haath jodne lage
 The system has made them so insecure that after the son's murder, the parents are watching their killings everyday
 shahji sonaavne ke 15 saal ke bete ko isliye dabangon ne maar diya kyonki usne ek aisi ladki se pyaar kar liya jo uski jati kii nahin thi
 Shahji Sonawane is a Dalit
 aap kahenge ki dalit kyon kaha kyonki honor kiling main jati ek pahalu hoti he
 Therefore, it is important to declare Dalit
 ye sab dastauez jo aap dekh rahe hai, kagaz nahin hai, swapanil kii laash he
 There is a blood in it and Mamta's lawyer husband Amit
 jise ye log thile main bharkar dilli aae hai
 See how lonely the system has made them
 media or system aapako tabhi tak sakasham samajhataa he jab tak aap kisi badi bheed kaa hissaa hote hai
 As soon as they are alone, they start searching for a building of trust
 aae din aisi kahaniyon ko dhote hue log news channelon se lekar tamaam tarah kii sansthaaon ke chakkar lagaate rahete hai
 Most of the time such stories are returned, as the evening of news channels is cut off by absurd statements
 aisi dastaanon ke liye vaaki mehnat kerani padati he
 Hundreds of pages have to be read
 reporter kii zarur padati he jo ab hai nahin
 Only the anchors who have attained the divine status remain
 kai baar in dastavezon ko samajhane or baratane kii yogyata bhi nahin hoti he
 But the common man is in trouble
 isliye kahata hum ki in bahason se aapkaa hameshaa bhala nahin he
 These debates are singling you out
 isiilie media aise logon ko bhaga detaa he
 Not all letters are worth reporting, but what happens is also thrown away
 aise log bina mili bhaga die jate hai
 i can not handle myself
 itane logon se kaise koi mil saktaa he
 That day survived me as it happened, but i want to tell you the story i got
 19 july 2016 kii ghatana he mumbai ke nerul ilaake kii yaheen par state bank of india ke upabhokta sahaayak shahji sonavane ke 15 saal ke bete swapanil sonavane kii hatya hoti he
 According to the father, some boys take Swapnil from home to auto before killing
 uski pitayee karte hai or phir thane le jate hai
 From the police station, the father and mother of Swapinal get information
 inkaa aarope he ki police chaahati to unka betaa mar saktaa tha magar unke anusaar aaropee police ke saamne hi 'sarat' film tu banane kii dhamkee dene lage
 In Sairat too, those who fall in love by breaking caste are killed
 honor kiling kii ghatana ko 16 maheene ho gaye magar peediton ko bharosa nahin he ki unki or unke liye cese lard rahe vakil kii jaan surakshit he
 This incident has been heavily published by the media of Maharashtra
 media ko 15 saal ke ek ladke kii hatya main 'sarat' film kaa doosraa hissaa nazar aayaa magar swapanil ke maa baap abhi tak khud ko nahin samajha paae hai ki samaaj ke kuch tabakon ke paas itani takat kahaan se aa jaati he ki 15 saal ke abodh ladke kii hatya ho jaati he
 Hindustan Times, The Times of India, Mumbai Mirror, Midday, Navbharat Times, Dabang Duniya, Noon Saamna, Vratratna Samrat, Aapal Mahanagar, Mumbai Chaufferay, Sandyakal, Janmabhoomi, Gujarat News, Divya Bhaskar, Sandesh, Indian Express, NDTV, TV9 featured and featured it
 aapane dekha ki kis tarah media kaa asar kamazor hua he or badal main aam aadmi usase bhi zyaada kamazor hua he
 Even after appearing in 20 types of media, their condition is that sometimes they meet the CM and sometimes they petition to meet the Police Commissioner
 kyon kisi ko bhatakana padataa he
 Why cannot there be a professional investigation of these cases at the station level? Is there any political pressure? 13 people were also arrested in this case
 5 alag-alag kaarnon se zamaanat par reeha bhi hue
 The Indian Express has written that government lawyers were changed thrice
 ek saal tak trial hi shuru nahin hua
 The trial was scheduled to begin on November 13, but on November 12, Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband Amit is attacked with a fatal attack
 hamale ke baad trial tal jaataa he
 Advocate Mamta Jadhav becomes so insecure about her husband's safety that she leaves a one and a half year old child in law and comes to Delhi, pleading with the Prime Minister and the President
 uske saath swapanil ke mata-pita bhi bhatak rahe the
 Lawyer Mamta Jadhav's mother-in-law is in the hospital where Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband is admitted
 4 taarikh ko pati kaa oparation ho gaya magar us vakt mamata jaghav dilli main thim
 Mamta told that when she and her husband started fighting the case of the murder of Shah Sonwane's son Swapnil, they started getting attacked
 ye hamale ruuk hi nahin rahe hai or police unhen suraksha nahin de rahi he
 Mamta also went to the Scheduled Castes Commission, also to the Women's Commission
 swapanil ke pita ne mukhyamantri or police kamishnar ko patr likhaa tha ki vakil amit kataranvare ko surajha di jaae
 Security not provided
 mamata ke pati par 5 sitambar or 12 november ko do baar hamalaa hota he
 Security is not provided even after the September 5 attack
 koi giraftaar nahin hoti he
 The attack on 12 November was fatal
 amit ko rod se maaraa gaya
 He broke his head and was crushed
 koi giraftaar nahin hai
 The trial was scheduled to begin on 13 November, postponed following the attack
 mamata chaahati thi ki exiaar main hamale ke liye police kii laaparvaahee ko bhi zimmedaar banaaya jaae
 According to him, the police wanted the name of the police to be removed
 aap is kahani main dekhie ki system ke saamne koun peedit he
 This is public hearing
 pehle log bolenge phir police apana paksh rakhegi to uskaa paksh aapke saamne zarur rakhenge
 This episode does not favor the police who are the victims
 mamata kahati hai ki 12 november ke hamale ke baad exiaar darj karaane gai to patni hote hue bhi unke naam se exiaar darj nahin kii gai
 It is possible that you will find this story boring
 yaad rakhiegaa, jab aap aisi sthiti main aaenge to baaki darshakon or media ko bhi aapaki kahani boring lagegi or iskaa phayda uthaakar system aapako tod degaa
 The comments mamata jadhav ne bataaya ki jab se swapanil kii hatya kaa cese liya he tab se ek hi maheene main unke upar achaanak danaadan exiaar hone lagati he
 Mamata and her husband are accused in an FIR number i396 / 16 on 6 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR number i400 / 16 main mamata or pati amit aaropee banaae jate hai
 On 8 October 2016, Amit and others are charged in the FIR
 9 aktubar 2016 ko bhi do alag-alag FIR darj hoti he
 In one, the husband-wife and in one the husband are accused
 9 aktubar ko ek or FIR pati amit or anya ke khilaaf hoti he
 On October 13 and 14, an FIR is registered against Mamta Jadhav and Amit
 jo vakil hai unke kilaaf achaanak se itane FIR kahaan se aa jate hai
 In many of these, these lawyer spouses are accused of helping to create fake caste certificates
 kya ye saare exiaar in par dabaav banane ke liye kiye gaye? 15 saal ke ek bete kii hatya hoti he, uskaa cese ek vakil ladane ko taiyaar hota he magar aap dekhie ki kabhi mukademe to kabhi hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mamta says that the attackers sometimes take the name of the minister, sometimes the name of the police
 isliye ham apni shikaayat main inhen aaropee banaate hai
 These people have come to Delhi so that Mamta's husband can get protection and there is no attack
 ye log arji banaakar har jagah de rahe hai
 Mamta Jadhav and Swapnil's father and mother have left for Mumbai
 mamata jadhav ne phone par bataaya ki unke pati kii suraksha main hamale ke baad aspataal main kuch suraksha karmi lage the, unhen hataa liya gaya he
 We tried to talk to the police officers but could not speak
 kuch ne phone kaat diya, kuch ne baat taal di
 Now what does this story tell you, how much a weak side has to fight for justice
 system use or kamazor kar detaa he
 During this, how many deaths he dies, in which insecurity lives
 maut ke sadame ke alaava paisa or vakt kaa to hisaab hi nahin
 The son was also killed and those fighting for justice are dying every day
 ho saktaa he ki inke paksh main kami ho lekin kya yah sahi nahin he ki system aadmi ko maar detaa he
 The common man stands unarmed in front of the system
 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie
 After all, even after receiving calls from the Prime Minister's office or writing letters or appearing in the media, the system does not matter
 ham system ke aise sataae logon kii prime time main jansunwaayee shuru kar rahe hai
 There is a small effort that the rubbish spokesperson disappears from the box and the common man gets his place in democracy
 1 disambar ko jab prime time kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha tab maharashtra se 6-7 log milane aae
 i kept waiting for four to five hours to go together
 jab kaarykram ke baad inase milane aayaa to maharashtra se dilli aae in logon ko jaankaree bhi nahin thi ki dilli kii thand kisi hoti he
 Wearing gloves in the hands even in mild cold
 inaki kabhi mujhase phone par baat hui thi, maine yun hi kah diya ki marathi main dastauez hai, main nahin pard saktaa
 i could not believe that many of these documents were translated into Hindi for me
 ek saal se inaki khabaren maharashtra ke angrezi or marathi akhbaaron main chap rahi hai
 But even then nothing happened
 jaise jaise ye log mere saath bag se dastavezon kii photo copy nikaal rahe the, main inaki jagah khud ko dekhne laga
 You too can see their own place
 vah sthiti kitni bhayanak hogi ki maharashtra main nyaay na milane par chaar-paanch log dilli aate hai, patrakaron se milane, pradhanmantri se milane, mantriyon se milane
 Now you understand how the system makes you unarmed and helpless
 aapaki puri zindagi ko dastavezon main samet kar bag main bhar detaa he
 People from Navi Mumbai started folding hands
 system ne inhen itnaa asurakshit kar diya he ki bete kii hatya ke baad maa-baap rose apni hatya hote dekh rahe he
 Shahji Sonawane's 15-year-old son was killed by the bullies because he fell in love with a girl who was not from his caste
 shahji sonavane dalit hai
 Why would you say that a Dalit is because caste is an aspect of honor killing
 isliye dalit bataanaa zaruri he
 All these documents that you are looking at, are not papers, are the dreams of Swapnil
 isamen or mamata ke vakil pati amit kaa koon he isamen
 Which these people have come to Delhi after stuffing them in bags
 dekhie system ne inhen kitna akelaa kar diya he
 The media and the system consider you competent as long as you are part of a large crowd
 jaise hi akele hote hai bharose kii imaarat khojane nikal padate hai
 Every day people carry such stories from news channels to various types of organizations
 zyaadaatar baar aisi kahaniyon ko lautaa diya jaataa he, kyonki news channelon kii shaam betuke bayanon se cat jaati he
 Hard work has to be done for such tales
 sainkadon panne padhane padate hai
 It is necessary to have a reporter who is no longer there
 paramatma kii shrenee ko praapt ho chuke ankar hi bache hai
 Many times these documents do not even have the ability to be understood and maintained
 lekin aam aadmi to mushkil main pad jaataa he
 Therefore, i say that you are not always well with these debates
 ye bahasein aapako akelaa kar rahi hai
 That is why the media drives away such people
 sabhi chitthiyaan report ke laayak nahin hoti hai magar jo hoti hai wo bhi phenk di jaati hai
 Such people are banished without being found
 main khud sambhaal nahin paata
 How can anyone meet so many people? us din mujhase yahi hote-hote batch gaya, lekin jo kahani mili wo main aapako sunaanaa chahta hum
 The incident of 19 July 2016 is the murder of Swapanil Sonwane, the 15-year-old son of State Bank of India's consumer assistant Shahaji Sonwane, in the Nerul area of mumbai
 pita ke anusaar hatya se pehle kuch ladke swapanil ko ghar se lekar auto main jate hai
 They beat him and then take him to the police station
 thane se swapinal ke pita or mata ko soochna milti he
 They have alleged that if the police wanted to, their son could have died, but according to him, the accused started threatening to make the film 'sairat' in front of the police
 sarat main bhi jati tod kar pyaar karne waalon ko hatya ho jaati he
 It has been 16 months since the incident of honor killing, but the victims are not sure that the life of the lawyer who is fighting the case for them is safe
 is ghatana ko maharashtra kii media ne khub chapa he
 The media saw the second part of the film 'sairat' in the murder of a 15-year-old boy, but Swapnil's parents have not yet been able to explain to themselves where some sections of the society come from so much power that the 15-year-old The innocent boy is killed
 hindustan times, di times of india, mumbai mirar, mid de, navabharat times , dabang duniya, dopaher kaa saamana, vrutaratna samraat, aapal mahanagar, mumbai chaufre, sandhyakaal, janmabhumi, gujarat samachar, divya bhaskar, sandesh, indian express, enditivi, tivi 9 ne ise chapa or dikhaaya
 You have seen how the influence of the media has weakened and in turn the common man has become even weaker than that
 20 prakaar ke media main chhapane ke baad bhi inkaa haal ye he ki ye kabhi siem se milte hai to kabhi police kamishnar se milane kii arji lagaate hai
 Why someone has to wander kyon thane ke str par in maamalon kii peshewar jaanch nahin ho sakati? kya koi raajnneetik dabaav he? is maamle main 13 log giraftaar bhi kiye gaye
 5 were also released on bail for different reasons
 indian express ne likhaa he ki teen-teen baar sarkari vakil badale gaye
 Trial did not start for a year
 13 november se trial shuru hone vaala tha, lekin 12 november ko mamata jadhav ke vakil pati amit par jaanaleva hamalaa hota he
 The trial is postponed after the attack
 vakil mamata jadhav apane pati kii suraksha ko lekar itani asurakshit ho jaati he ki dedh saal ke bachche ko saas ke paas chhodkar dilli aa jaati he, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati se guhaar lagane
 Swapnil's parents were wandering with him
 vakil mamata jadhav kii saas aspataal main he jahaan mamata jadhav kaa vakil pati bhartee hai
 The husband underwent an operation on the 4th, but Mamta Jaghav was in Delhi at that time
 mamata ne bataaya ki jab wo or uske pati ne shah sonavane ke bete swapanil kii hatya kaa cese ladanaa shuru kiya to un par hamale hone lage
 These attacks are not stopping and the police is not protecting them
 mamata anusuchit jati ayog bhi gai, mahila ayog bhi gayi
 Swapnil's father wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and the Commissioner of Police asking for lawyer Amit Katarnavre to be tried
 suraksha nahin di gai
 Mamta's husband is attacked twice on 5 September and 12 November
 5 sitambar ke hamale ke baad bhi suraksha nahin di jaati he
 There is no arrest
 12 november kaa hamalaa jaanaleva tha
 Amit gets hit by a rod
 sar phod diya or paanv kooch diya gaya
 No arrests were made
 13 november ko trial shuru hone vaala tha, is hamale ke baad tal gaya he
 Mamta wanted the police negligence to be made responsible for the attack in the FIR
 unke anusaar police chaahati thi ki police kaa naam hataa diya jaae
 In this story, you see who is suffering in front of the system
 yah jansunwaayee he
 First people will speak and then the police will put their side, then they will definitely put their side in front of you
 is episod main police kaa paksh nahin he jo peedit hai unka he
 Mamta says that after the November 12 attack, the FIR was lodged in her name despite being a wife
 mumkin he aapako yah kahani boring lagegi
 Remember, when you come in such a situation, the rest of the audience and the media will find your story boring and taking advantage of it, the system will break you
 tippaniyan Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone
 ab aapako samaj aayaa ki system kaise aapako nihattha or laachaar kar detaa he
 Stuffs your entire life into documents and stuffs it in the bag
 naveen mumbai se aae log haath jodne lage
 The system has made them so insecure that after the son's murder, the parents are watching their killings everyday
 shahji sonaavne ke 15 saal ke bete ko isliye dabangon ne maar diya kyonki usne ek aisi ladki se pyaar kar liya jo uski jati kii nahin thi
 Shahji Sonawane is a Dalit
 aap kahenge ki dalit kyon kaha kyonki honor kiling main jati ek pahalu hoti he
 Therefore, it is important to declare Dalit
 ye sab dastauez jo aap dekh rahe hai, kagaz nahin hai, swapanil kii laash he
 There is a blood in it and Mamta's lawyer husband Amit
 jise ye log thile main bharkar dilli aae hai
 See how lonely the system has made them
 media or system aapako tabhi tak sakasham samajhataa he jab tak aap kisi badi bheed kaa hissaa hote hai
 As soon as they are alone, they start searching for a building of trust
 aae din aisi kahaniyon ko dhote hue log news channelon se lekar tamaam tarah kii sansthaaon ke chakkar lagaate rahete hai
 Most of the time such stories are returned, as the evening of news channels is cut off by absurd statements
 aisi dastaanon ke liye vaaki mehnat kerani padati he
 Hundreds of pages have to be read
 reporter kii zarur padati he jo ab hai nahin
 Only the anchors who have attained the divine status remain
 kai baar in dastavezon ko samajhane or baratane kii yogyata bhi nahin hoti he
 But the common man is in trouble
 isliye kahata hum ki in bahason se aapkaa hameshaa bhala nahin he
 These debates are singling you out

 Not all letters are worth reporting, but what happens is also thrown away

 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie
 The media and the system consider you competent as long as you are part of a large crowd
 jaise hi akele hote hai bharose kii imaarat khojane nikal padate hai
 Every day people carry such stories from news channels to various types of organizations
 zyaadaatar baar aisi kahaniyon ko lautaa diya jaataa he, kyonki news channelon kii shaam betuke bayanon se cat jaati he
 Hard work has to be done for such tales
 sainkadon panne padhane padate hai
 It is necessary to have a reporter who is no longer there
 paramatma kii shrenee ko praapt ho chuke ankar hi bache hai
 Many times these documents do not even have the ability to be understood and maintained
 lekin aam aadmi to mushkil main pad jaataa he
 Therefore, i say that you are not always well with these debates
 ye bahasein aapako akelaa kar rahi hai
 That is why the media drives away such people
 sabhi chitthiyaan report ke laayak nahin hoti hai magar jo hoti hai wo bhi phenk di jaati hai
 Such people are banished without being found
 main khud sambhaal nahin paata
 How can anyone meet so many people? us din mujhase yahi hote-hote batch gaya, lekin jo kahani mili wo main aapako sunaanaa chahta hum
 The incident of 19 July 2016 is the murder of Swapanil Sonwane, the 15-year-old son of State Bank of India's consumer assistant Shahaji Sonwane, in the Nerul area of mumbai

 thane se swapinal ke pita or mata ko soochna milti he
 They have alleged that if the police wanted to, their son could have died, but according to him, the accused started threatening to make the film 'sairat' in front of the police
 sarat main bhi jati tod kar pyaar karne waalon ko hatya ho jaati he
 It has been 16 months since the incident of honor killing, but the victims are not sure that the life of the lawyer who is fighting the case for them is safe
 is ghatana ko maharashtra kii media ne khub chapa he
 The media saw the second part of the film 'sairat' in the murder of a 15-year-old boy, but Swapnil's parents have not yet been able to explain to themselves where some sections of the society come from so much power that the 15-year-old The innocent boy is killed

 You have seen how the influence of the media has weakened and in turn the common man has become even weaker than that
 20 prakaar ke media main chhapane ke baad bhi inkaa haal ye he ki ye kabhi siem se milte hai to kabhi police kamishnar se milane kii arji lagaate hai
 Why someone has to wander kyon thane ke str par in maamalon kii peshewar jaanch nahin ho sakati? kya koi raajnneetik dabaav he? is maamle main 13 log giraftaar bhi kiye gaye
 5 were also released on bail for different reasons
 indian express ne likhaa he ki teen-teen baar sarkari vakil badale gaye
 Trial did not start for a year
 13 november se trial shuru hone vaala tha, lekin 12 november ko mamata jadhav ke vakil pati amit par jaanaleva hamalaa hota he
 The trial is postponed after the attack
 vakil mamata jadhav apane pati kii suraksha ko lekar itani asurakshit ho jaati he ki dedh saal ke bachche ko saas ke paas chhodkar dilli aa jaati he, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati se guhaar lagane
 Swapnil's parents were wandering with him
 vakil mamata jadhav kii saas aspataal main he jahaan mamata jadhav kaa vakil pati bhartee hai
 The husband underwent an operation on the 4th, but Mamta Jaghav was in Delhi at that time
 mamata ne bataaya ki jab wo or uske pati ne shah sonavane ke bete swapanil kii hatya kaa cese ladanaa shuru kiya to un par hamale hone lage
 These attacks are not stopping and the police is not protecting them
 mamata anusuchit jati ayog bhi gai, mahila ayog bhi gayi
 Swapnil's father wrote a letter to the Chief Minister and the Commissioner of Police asking for lawyer Amit Katarnavre to be tried
 suraksha nahin di gai
 Mamta's husband is attacked twice on 5 September and 12 November
 5 sitambar ke hamale ke baad bhi suraksha nahin di jaati he
 There is no arrest
 12 november kaa hamalaa jaanaleva tha
 Amit gets hit by a rod
 sar phod diya or paanv kooch diya gaya
 No arrests were made
 13 november ko trial shuru hone vaala tha, is hamale ke baad tal gaya he
 Mamta wanted the police negligence to be made responsible for the attack in the FIR
 unke anusaar police chaahati thi ki police kaa naam hataa diya jaae
 In this story, you see who is suffering in front of the system
 yah jansunwaayee he
 First people will speak and then the police will put their side, then they will definitely put their side in front of you
 is episod main police kaa paksh nahin he jo peedit hai unka he
 Mamta says that after the November 12 attack, the FIR was lodged in her name despite being a wife
 mumkin he aapako yah kahani boring lagegi
 Remember, when you come in such a situation, the rest of the audience and the media will find your story boring and taking advantage of it, the system will break you
 tippaniyan Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone

 The Indian Express has written that government lawyers were changed thrice
 ek saal tak trial hi shuru nahin hua
 The trial was scheduled to begin on November 13, but on November 12, Mamta Jadhav's lawyer husband Amit is attacked with a fatal attack
 hamale ke baad trial tal jaataa he
 Advocate Mamta Jadhav becomes so insecure about her husband's safety that she leaves a one and a half year old child in law and comes to Delhi, pleading with the Prime Minister and the President

 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR number i400 / 16 main mamata or pati amit aaropee banaae jate hai
 On 8 October 2016, Amit and others are charged in the FIR
 9 aktubar 2016 ko bhi do alag-alag FIR darj hoti he
 In one, the husband-wife and in one the husband are accused
 9 aktubar ko ek or FIR pati amit or anya ke khilaaf hoti he
 On October 13 and 14, an FIR is registered against Mamta Jadhav and Amit
 jo vakil hai unke kilaaf achaanak se itane FIR kahaan se aa jate hai
 In many of these, these lawyer spouses are accused of helping to create fake caste certificates
 kya ye saare exiaar in par dabaav banane ke liye kiye gaye? 15 saal ke ek bete kii hatya hoti he, uskaa cese ek vakil ladane ko taiyaar hota he magar aap dekhie ki kabhi mukademe to kabhi hamale kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Mamta says that the attackers sometimes take the name of the minister, sometimes the name of the police
 isliye ham apni shikaayat main inhen aaropee banaate hai
 These people have come to Delhi so that Mamta's husband can get protection and there is no attack
 ye log arji banaakar har jagah de rahe hai
 Mamta Jadhav and Swapnil's father and mother have left for Mumbai
 mamata jadhav ne phone par bataaya ki unke pati kii suraksha main hamale ke baad aspataal main kuch suraksha karmi lage the, unhen hataa liya gaya he
 We tried to talk to the police officers but could not speak
 kuch ne phone kaat diya, kuch ne baat taal di
 Now what does this story tell you, how much a weak side has to fight for justice
 system use or kamazor kar detaa he
 During this, how many deaths he dies, in which insecurity lives
 maut ke sadame ke alaava paisa or vakt kaa to hisaab hi nahin
 The son was also killed and those fighting for justice are dying every day
 ho saktaa he ki inke paksh main kami ho lekin kya yah sahi nahin he ki system aadmi ko maar detaa he
 The common man stands unarmed in front of the system
 aap kahaan khadey hai, kya aapako yah sawaal mahatvapurn nahin lagata ki system sabake liye peshewar tareeke se or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke kaam karnaa chahie
 Mamta wanted the police negligence to be made responsible for the attack in the FIR
 unke anusaar police chaahati thi ki police kaa naam hataa diya jaae
 In this story, you see who is suffering in front of the system
 yah jansunwaayee he
 First people will speak and then the police will put their side, then they will definitely put their side in front of you
 is episod main police kaa paksh nahin he jo peedit hai unka he
 Mamta says that after the November 12 attack, the FIR was lodged in her name despite being a wife
 mumkin he aapako yah kahani boring lagegi
 Remember, when you come in such a situation, the rest of the audience and the media will find your story boring and taking advantage of it, the system will break you
 tippaniyan Mamta Jadhav said that ever since the case of murder of Swapnil has taken place, in the same month, a sudden FIR is started against him
 6 aktubar 2016 ko ek FIR number i396 / 16 main mamata or unke pati aaropee banaae jate hai
 Mamata and husband Amit are made accused in FIR number i400 / 16 on 8 October 2016
 8 aktubar 2016 ko FIR main amit or anya ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 Two separate firs are also registered on 9 October 2016
 ek main pati-patni or ek main pati ko aaropee banaaya jaataa he
 On October 9, another FIR is filed against husband Amit and others
 13 or 14 aktubar ko mamata jadhav or amit ke kilaaf FIR hoti he
 Where do all the firs suddenly come against the lawyers who are there
 inamen se kai main in vakil pati-patni par farji jati pramaan patr banavaane main madad kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he
 Were all these firs done to pressure them? a 15-year-old son is killed, a lawyer is ready to fight his case, but you see that sometimes the case is facing attack
 mamata kahati hai ki hamalavar kabhi mantri kaa naam lete hai, kabhi police kaa naam lete hai
 So we make them accused in our complaint
 ye log dilli isliye aae hai ki mamata ke pati ko suraksha mil sake or hamalaa na ho
 These people are making applications and giving them everywhere
 mamata jadhav or swapanil ke pita or maa mumbai waapas ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 Mamta Jadhav told over the phone that some security personnel were employed in the hospital after the attack under the protection of her husband, she has been removed
 hamane police adhikariyon se baat karne kaa prayaas kiya magar baat nahin ho saki
 Some disconnected the phone, some postponed it
 ab ye kahani aapse kya kahati he, ek kamazor paksh ko insaaf ke liye kitna ladanaa padataa he
 The system weakens it further
 is dauraan wo kitni mautein marataa he, kis asuraksha ke maahaul main jeeta he
 Apart from the shock of death, there is no account of money and time
 bete ko bhi maar diya gaya or jo insaaf ke liye lard rahe hai wo rose mar rahe hai
 It may be that they are lacking in favor, but is it not right that the system kills man
 system ke saamne aam aadmi nihattha khadaa he
 Where do you stand, don't you think the question is important that the system should work in a professional manner and without any discrimination for everyone

 It does not need to be a political pundit that why the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh started a debate on reviewing the caste reservation, despite the huge losses in the Bihar elections, not on the design of the Sangh, but on the fact that the government slammed it in the sand And twisted the neck of an urgent debate within the Parliament, whereas a strong government could make it a chance and start a positive debate
 sangh kaa suzav uske vyapak dharmik-saanskrithik agenda se judata he, jo vivaadit he, lekin iske baad bhi haryana ke jat va gujarat ke patidaar andolan kii aakraamakata or samrudh tabakon ko aarakshan ke laabh kii roshni main, koi bhi sangh ke tark se sahamat hoga ki jaateey aarakshan kii samiksha par charchaa to shuru honi hi chahie
 Especially at a time when the country has the latest economic caste census data on which the government is sitting silently
 jaateey aarakshan main yathasthiti banaae rakhane ke aagrah hameshaa taqatvar rahe hai, jinaki vajah se bijepi or sarkaar ko sangh kaa suzav khaarij karnaa padaa
 The government's refusal to review ethnic reservations is, in fact, the departure point of doctrinal disagreements between the BJP and the Sangh that separate the Sangh's cultural agenda from the chemistry of BJP politics
 aarthik va dharmik (ram mandir) agenda par thik isi tarah kii asahmatiyaan atal bihari vaajapeyi va sangh ke bich dekhi gai thim
 The government may deny it, but the debate has started to review the reservation, which is not about the ethnic identity but the job market
 is tathy se koi inkaar nahin karegaa ki aarakshan ne chuni hui sansthaaon (panchayat se vidhayika tak) or rajnatik padon par jaateey pratinidhitiv ko safaltaapurvak santulit kiya he or is aarakshan ko jari rakhane main aapatti bhi nahin he
 The real ground of reservation is about the share in government jobs
 agar rojgaron ke bazaar ko badhaayaa jaae to sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kii basir-pair kii deewangi ko sambhala ja saktaa he
 To understand this non-political context of the reservation debate, it is necessary to understand the job market
 bharat main rojgaar ke bharosemand aankade uplabdh nahin hai isliye aarakshan jaisi suvidhaon ke aitihaasik laabh kii padtaal mushkil he
 Yet according to the figures (world Economic Forum and Economic Review 2015-16), the total number of employed people is only 4
 9 karod he jo 1
 Evidence of unemployment in a population of 28 billion is evidenced
 inamen 94 fisadi log asangathit kshetra main niojit hai, jabaki keval chaar fisadi log sangathit kshetra main hai jisamen sarkari va nijee, donon tarah ke rojgaar shaamil hai
 The latest Economic Review states that in 2012 a total of 2 in the organized sector
 95 karod log kaam kar rahe the, jinamein 1
 76 crore people were in the government sector
 sarkari rojgaron ke is chote se aankade main centre va rajya kii naukariyaan shaamil hai
 Railways, army and banks are the largest employment hubs in the central government, but there is not enough number of jobs in them to accommodate even 10 per cent of the applications
 centre sarkaar kii naukariyon main kareeb 60 fisadi pad group si or kareeb 29 fisadi pad group di ke hai jo sarkari naukariyon main sabase nichle vetan varg hai
 The remaining government sector jobs are in the states and there too the jobs structure is almost like the central government
 is aankade se yah samajhnaa jaruri he ki aarakshan kaa puraa sangharsh, do karod se bhi kam naukariyon ke liye he jinamein adhikansh naukariyaan group si va di kii hai jinke kaaran varshon se itani raajnneeti ho rahi he
 It is worth noting that the size of governments is decreasing with which jobs are to be reduced
 aarthik samiksha bataati he ki sarkari naukariyon main badhotaree kii gati ek fisadi se bhi kam he, jabaki sangathit nijee kshetra main naukariyon ke badaae kii raftaar 5
 6 percent
 lekin sangathit (sarkari va nijee) kshetra keval chah fisadi rojgaar detaa he isliye rojgaar bazaar main is hisse kii ghat-bad koi bada fark paidaa nahin karti
 Most of the employment is in the unorganized sector, whose concrete data is not available, but it is definitely known that services like unorganized sector like trade and retail, small scale industries, transport, building construction, tens of people are giving more jobs than any government system in India
 Huh
 yah sabhi kaarobaar bharat ke vishaal jeevika tantra (livelihud network) kaa hissaa hai jo apni growth ke saath rojgaar bhi paidaa karte hai
 In order to increase jobs, the vast livelihood system in India has to be expanded, which requires further opening up of the Indian market as jobs or livelihoods in India ultimately have to come from the private sector
 yadi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh aarakshan kii bahes ko kaayade se shuru karnaa chahta he to use is tathy par sahamat hona hoga ki bharat main vyapak nijeekaran, nivesh or videshi nivesh kii jarurat he taaki rojgaar kaa bazaar bad sake or mutthibhar sarkari naukariyon ke aarakshan kii siyasat band ho sake, jo antat un tabakon ko hi milti hai jo qatari main aage khadey hai
 There can be two ways to get into the reservation debate
 ek ise rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke nazariye se dekha jaae jo dharmik rashtravaadi agenda kii raah main bichhi jaateey daraaron ko bharna chahta he or doosraa rasta yah he ki ham jaateey raajnneeti ke agrahon main utar yathasthiti ko sweekaar karte hue bahes ko nakaar den jaisaa ki sarkaar ne kiya
 Apart from these, there is a third way where instead of confining the debate on reservation to government jobs, everyone has to take the debate to livelihood
 hamen aisi nitiyon par bahes kerani hogi jo sabko jeevika sunishchit karti hon, vah jeevika kahin bhi, kisi bhi kshetra se aa sakati he, jisamen naukariyaan or udhyamita, donon shaamil hongi
 Only then will the debate on reservation be started with which the whole country would like to join

 After the Supreme Court's decision, the Allahabad High Court is expected to give its verdict on the Ayodhya Proprietorship case soon as one of the three judges of the bench hearing the case, Justice Dharamvir Sharma, is retiring on October 1
 Huh
 isse pehle atarni general ji i vaahnavati ne kaha ki anischitata kii sthiti nahin bani rahani chaiye
 Appearing before a three-member bench of Chief Justice SH Kapadia, Justice Aftab Alam and Justice KS Radhakrishnan, Vahanvati said that the most wanted solution in the case was a negotiated solution, but that did not happen and was unsure The situation remains, it should not be allowed to continue
 supreme court kii teen sadasyeey peeth ne treepathi kii yachika khaarij karne kaa faisla sarvasammati se liya
 In his argument before the bench, the Attorney General said that since 1999, the government is in favor of resolving the matter from negotiations but it could not be done
 unhone kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki maamle kaa kisi na kisi tarah hal nikaala jaye
 We cannot keep the law and order machinery suspended
 vaahnavati ne kaha ki meri sthiti bilkul spasht he
 i think that the case should be decided
 1994 ke janadesh ke anusaar bhi hamen yahi karnaa chaiye
 He also referred to the decision of the Constitution Bench on the acquisition of disputed land in Ayodhya
 unhone rohtagi ke is aaropon ko khaarij kar diya ki kendra is maamle main chuppi saadhe rahaa or keval vivaadit bhoomi ke ek resiver ke taur par bana rahaa
 Vahanvati said that the government is determined to restore the rule of law and is committed to abide by its assurance given to the apex court on 14 September 1994
 atarni general ne rohtagi kii is daleel kaa bhi khandan kiya ki sarkaar baatcheet or vaarta prakriya ke jariye is maamle kaa hal nikaalane ke prati sakriy nahin rahi
 He said that the government believes in respecting the rule of law
 vaahnavati ne rohtagi kii us daleel ko bhi nakaar diya ki elahabaad hoicourt kaa faisla dene vaali peeth ke sevanivrutt hone vaale nyaayadhish kaa kaarykaal sarkaar badhaa sakati he
 He said that the center has no right in this regard
 yah adhikaar hoicourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish kaa he or supreme court kaa kalegium is maamle main kuch had tak sifarish kar saktaa he
 Earlier, the counsel for the party, requesting to postpone the decision on the case, argued that the court and the government could take new initiative to resolve the matter through out-of-court negotiations
 vaise nirmohi akhaade ko chhodkar maamle se jude anya sabhi pakshon ne elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu peeth dwaara saath saal puraane is maamle par sunaaye jane vaale faisle ko taale jane kaa virodh kiya
 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the apex court on behalf of Tripathi, said in the court that it is a matter related to emotions and the court and the government should take active initiative to resolve the matter through negotiation
 elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu peeth ke teen nyaayadhishon main se ek ke sevanivrutt hone par maamle par naye sire se sunwaayee kii ashanka kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki aise upaay hai jinke jariye sarkaar is samasya se nipat sakati he
 The retiring judge can be reappointed or his successor can pronounce his judgment
 rohtagi ne yah bhi daleel di ki 1993 main sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan ke baad malikana haq kaa koi maamla lambit rah hi nahin saktaa
 He said that three judges of the Lucknow bench also agreed on the need to resolve the matter through negotiation and had fixed the period till September 24, but the matter is so closely related to emotions that the time limit cannot be fixed in it
 treepathi ke aagrah kaa virodh karte hue sunni vakf board ke vakil ne kaha ki yah yachika nihit uddeshy se di gayi he or is par sunwaayee nahin kii jaani chaiye
 He said that there should be some basis on which an acceptable solution can be found for all the parties, but it is sad that there is nothing like this here
 varisht vakil ravi shankar prasad ne maamle ke ek or paksh kii taraf se pesh hote hue kaha, ‘vah (treepathi) ek gaiyr sanjeeda paksh hai jo elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth ke samaksh hui lambii sunwaayee ke dauraan vahaan niyamit rup se pahunche bhi nahin the
 He said that this argument should also not be accepted that adverse consequences can come if the verdict is given
 unhone kaha, ‘agar parinaam ke bare main di gayi is daleel ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he to yahaan tak ki jamaanat dene kaa aagrah karte hue daayar yachika ke bhi nakaaratmak parinaam ho sakate hai
 'he said, ' The judges of the High Court tried and tried repeatedly to resolve the matter through negotiation
 ’ varisht vakil ne kaha ki maamle ko adaalat se baahar baatcheet ke jariye hal karne ke liye or samay dene kii jarurat nahin he
 Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee, appearing for another side of the case, agreed with Prasad's plea that the judicial process cannot be held hostage to the result
 purv pradhanmantri ne bhi maamle ko baatcheet se hal karwaane ke prayaas kiye the lekin vah bhi vifal rahe
 Sorabji said, "we are in favor of a complete resolution of the matter but at the same time we are completely against the request that the decision of the case be deferred
" ’ucchtam nyaayalay ne treepathi kii yachika ke aadhaar par gat 23 sitambar ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth ke ayodhya malikana haq vivaad par 24 sitambar ko faisla sunaane par ek saptaah ke liye antarim roak laga di thi
 However, Justice RV Raveendran and Justice HL Gokhale, both judges of the two-member bench of the apex court, hearing Tripathi's petition on 23 September, had differing opinions
 donon nyaayadhishon ke vichaar alag alag hone ke kaaran unhone treepathi kii yachika par sambhddha pakshon ko notice jari kar diya or yah maamla pradhan nyaayadhish ke supurd karte hue badi peeth ke gathan kaa aagrah kiya tha
 Tripathi, in his petition, had requested to be given time and postpone the decision to find a solution to the sixty-year-old matter by negotiation
 aise niyam isliye banaae gaye hai, taaki yadi kisi bhi vakt kisi bhi bank main bahut badi taadaad main jamakartaon ko rakam nikaalane kii zarurat mahasoos ho, to bank paisa chukaane se inkaar na kar sake
 
 
 CRR is a tool through which RBI can reduce the liquidity of cash from the market without changing the reverse repo rate
 
 
 siaraar badaye jane kii sthiti main bainkon ko zyaada bada hissaa rigerv bank ke paas rakhana hoga, or unke paas rin ke rup main dene ke liye kam rakam rah jaaegi
 
 
 In contrast, to increase cash in the market, the Reserve Bank deducts the CRR
 
 
 lekin mahatvapurn tathy yah he ki siaraar main badlaav tabhi kiya jaataa he, jab bazaar main nakadi kii taralata par turant asar na daalana ho, kyonki repo rate or reverse repo rate main badlaav kii tulana main siaraar main kiye gaye badlaav se bazaar par asar zyaada samay main padataa he
 
 
 In the event of CRR increase, banks will have to keep a larger share with the Reserve Bank, and they will have less money to give as loans
 
 
 isi ke vipareet bazaar main nakadi badhaane ke liye rigerv bank siaraar ko ghataya karata he
 
 
 But the important fact is that the change in CRR is done only when the liquidity in the market is not immediately affected by the change in the CRR as compared to the change in the repo rate and reverse repo rate

e
 Sunday
 ek taraf digvijay singh ke bayaan ne jahaan congress kii kirakiri kara di to vahiin shaam hote-hote van mantri umang singaar ke ek bayaan ne congress ke bheetar tufaan laa diya he
 Forest Minister Umang Singhar, who attended an event in Dhar, made a statement against senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, which has confirmed the bjp's question that he is constantly accused of being divided among several factions of Congress
 Has been applying van mantri umang singhar se jab patrakaron ne digvijay singh dwaara kamalnath sarkaar ke mantriyon ko likhi gai chitthee se judaa sawaal poocha to mantri umang singhar ne kaha ki mananeey digvijay singh ji ke bare main sirf yahi kahuunga ki parde ke peeche se sarkaar vahi chalaa rahe hai
 He said that everyone knows this from the party worker to the leader
 mantri umang singhar yaheen nahin ruke unhone digvijay singh par ek or hamalaa karte hue kaha ki unhen chitthee likhane kii jarurat hi nahin thi jab sarkaar hi chalaa rahe hai to chitthee likhane kii jarurat hi kyon? mantri umang singaar ke is bayaan se congress main khalabali much gai he
 Questions have started to arise whether the Congress has not left factionalism despite being out of power for 15 years
 bijepi ne saadhaa nishanajab congress sarkaar ke mantri hi congress ke varisht netaa par hamalaa bol rahe hon to bhala pramukh vipakshi party bijepi peeche kaise rahati
 Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan Many leaders of the BJP lashed out at the Congress after the statement of Minister Umang Singar
 bijepi ne kaha ki vah shuru se yah baat kahati ai he ki madhya pradesh main teen-teen mukhyamantriyon kii sarkaar he or yah baat mantri ke bayaan ke baad spasht ho gai
 BJP asked Congress the question that when the government is running Digvijay Singh from behind the curtain, then what is Chief Minister Kamal Nath doing? Shivraj's attack on Congress Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that there is an unprecedented constitutional crisis in Madhya Pradesh has gone
 mukhyamantri pad kii shapath kamalnath ne lee he lekin sarkaar digvijay singh chalaa rahe hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that the Congress should clarify the situation as to who is the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh? Because we were already saying that there is a government of two and a half chief ministers in Madhya Pradesh
 purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan main siem kamalnath se sawaal poocha ki digvijay singh ko sarkaar ke mantriyon ko chitthee likhane kaa adhikaar kisne diya? digvijay singh mantriyon ko chitthee likh rahe hai, puch rahe hai koun-koun se kaam hue? shivaraj ne congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki digvijay singh ko mantriyon ko dhamkaane kaa adhikaar kisne diya he? shivaraj singh chouhan ne congress adhyaksha sonia gandhi se apil kii he ki wo hastkshep karen or bataae asli CM koun he? haikaman tay kare ki sarkaar koun chalaae kyonki madhyapradesh main ab afasar bhi pasopesh main he ki kiski sune or kiski naa sune

 Despite the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati is in the process of trying a Brahmin card once again
 aam chunaav 2019 ke liye basapa supremeo ne abhi tak jitne bhi loksabhaa prabharee ghoshit kiye hai, unamem sabase badi taadaad brahman samudaay ke netaaon kii hai
 The BSP is believed to be the candidate who is made the Lok Sabha in-charge
 basapa ke liye pashchim upi kii tulana main purvi uttar pradesh thodaa kamjor mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, Mayawati has made a big bet
 basapa supremeo ne ravivaar ko uttar pradesh main 18 prabhariyon ke naam ghoshit kiye hai
 However, many of these names have already been announced
 basapa ne brahman card ke rup main bhadohi se ranganath mishra, sitapur se nakul dube, fatehpur sikri se seemaa upaadhyaay, ghosi se ajay raay, pratapgarh se ashok tiwari or khalilabad se kushal tiwari ke naam lagbhag tay mana ja rahe hai
 Purvanchal Brahmin is considered a strong stronghold
 yahi vajah he ki basapa purvi uttar pradesh se 6 brahman chehre utaarne kaa man bana chuki he
 In fact, in Uttar Pradesh, the bsp's policy of working behind the Brahmin card is working
 2007 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main basapa ne dalit-brahman gathjod kaa bada prayog kiya tha
 Mayawati also got its political advantage
 yahi vajah he ki purvanchal main congress-bijepi kii kaat ke liye basapa brahmanon par ek baar phir bharosa jataayaa he
 The battle for political supremacy between the Brahmins and Thakurs in Purvanchal is well known
 haalanki modi lahar main yah ladaai kund pad gai thi, lekin mayawati ko ummid he ki yogi adityanath ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad brahmanon ko apane paale main wo laane main safal ho sakati hai
 Actually CM Yogi comes from Rajput community
 haalanki congress bhi apana puraa dam-kham purvi uttar pradesh main laga rakhaa he
 Congress has handed over the command of Purvanchal to Priyanka Gandhi
 aise main raajnneetik dalon ke bich brahman voton ko apane paale main laane koshish tej ho gai he
 bsp's betting on a Brahmin candidate in most seats of Purvanchal is part of this strategy

 It is believed that the government may run from Delhi but the road to power passes through Uttar Pradesh
 kyonki piem modi banaras kii seat se ummidavaar hai
 At the same time, amidst this chaos, a daughter of the same Banaras is wandering in Delhi
 kaaran unki naukari par mandaraata khatra he or use ab pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa hi aasraa he
 28-year-old Khushboo Chauhan, a resident of Saket area of varanasi, is sitting on a dharna with her friends on Pandit Pant Marg in Delhi
 isi jagah par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa pradesh karyaalay he
 Nobody is worried about hearing the story of Khushboo in the corridors of power, nor does he hope that there can be any solution to his problem before the elections, but he has only hope that his voice reaches PM Modi 
 apane guest teacher saathiyon ke saath dharne par baithi khushboo pradhanmantri narendra modi se puch rahi he ki 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' naare kaa kya karenge, jab banaras ke raaj mistre kii ye beti naukari nahin kar sakati?darasal khushboo ne akhbaar main pichley saal guest teacher kaa ek vigyaapan dekha or applai kar diya
 She was also selected as a counselor at a school in Shadipur, Delhi and she started living there with a rented room
 isse pehle kii dilli kii bheed main vah puri tarah ram paatin, unhen pataa chalaa kii naukari pakki nahin he or kabhi bhi ja sakati he
 Khushboo says that the future of about 22,000 guest teachers is in the same vein
 jab vah banaras se 15 march, 2018 ko chalin thim, to unka puraa parivaar or dost unhen stesan tak chhodane aae the
 Tears of happiness arose in the eyes of the householders that the daughter of a mechanic would go to Delhi and do a government job and remove all the financial crisis in the house, but this happiness of fragrance did not last long
 is saal 1 march se tamaam guest teacheron ke saath khushboo bhi yahaan vahaan dharna de rahi hai
 There are elections in Delhi as well as in Benaras
 khushboo piem or apane kshetra ke saansad narendra modi se apane or un tamaam guest teacheron ke liye guhaar laga rahi he, jinhen ye pataa nahin kii kal naukari rahegi yaa nahin
 Khushboo says that her father Satyanarayana Chauhan works as a daily mechanic and has taught him in very difficult circumstances
 khushboo manovigyaan main eme hai or gidence or counselling main diploma bhi kar chuki hai
 Khushboo says that her father worked hard to teach her so much and never pressed for a job
 lekin jab khushboo ne sochaa ki ab pita ko madad karne kii unki baari he to naukari haath se jaati dikhi
 His desire to live a financially strong life out of poverty and to lift his family out of poverty remained unfulfilled because neither the previous government of Delhi nor the present Aam Aadmi Party government kept their promise and confirmed their jobs
 ab unhen pradhanmantri se ummid he
 Khushboo says that she does not have much money left
 20 din kaam milane par 30,000 rupye mil jate hai lekin kitne din kaam milegaa ye pataa nahin, kaam kal milegaa ki nahin, ye bhi nahin pataa
 Khushboo is pleading for Modi to be from Banaras and is seeking help for his colleagues, whose condition is almost similar to him
 khushboo kahati hai ki guest teacheron ko permanent karnaa bilkul mumkin he kyonki ye haryana main pehle hi ho chukaa he
 Explain that there are 61168 teachers in Delhi's government schools, out of which 34,323 teachers are permanent and 21,271 are guest teachers

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, once known as 'captain Cool' and 'mr
 Dependable', is going through difficult times
 england main khele ja rahe world cap main dhoni ko apni batting ke liye kaafii aalochana kaa shikaar hona pad rahaa he
 In particular, the way Dhoni's batting against England disappointed his fans and many former cricketers
 dhoni ko cricket kii duniya main best finishars main se ek mana jaataa rahaa he
 Unlike Dhoni who used to score runs in the past, now he can be seen struggling to score runs fast
 2019 world cap ke liye jaise hi bharat ne apane mishan kii shuruyaat kii to dhoni ko lekar kaafii kuch kaha ja rahaa tha
 Dhoni's name has the distinction of being the captain of Team India for the longest time
 38 varshiya wicketiper batsman dhoni ke liye world cap main khilne kaa ye aakhri mauka he
 But his performance in this World Cup has not been the same as he would have hoped
 maujuuda world cap main sabase kamazor tiimon main se ek afghanistan ke khilaaf match main dhoni ne 52 gendon main 28 ran kii sust pari kheli
 He also had to hear a lot of criticism for this innings
 yahaan tak ki master blaster sachin tendulkar bhi ye kehane se apane ko nahin roak sake ki dhoni kii ye pari bahut dhimi thi or usamen positive aprope nazar nahin ai
 Dhoni also had his eye on the match against England
 lekin puure toornament main bharat ko ab tak is match main hi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 India had to chase a score of 338 to win the match and in the last 5 overs, India needed 71 runs
 tab krij par dhoni or kedaar jadhav the
 India were left behind by 31 runs at the end of the match even though India had five wickets left
 best finishr kii jagah dhoni gend ko seemaa rekha se baahar pahunchane or ran kii gati tej karne ke liye jujhate dikhaai die
 Dhoni remained not out after scoring 41 runs in 32 balls
 vahiin jadhav 13 gend par 12 ran bana kar note out rahe
 Both could add 39 runs in the last five overs in which they took 20 singles and played 7 dot balls
 is world cap main bharat ne ab tak apane 8 maichon main se 7 hi khele hai, vahiin ek match barish ke kaaran radd ho gaya tha
 In these 7 matches, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has scored a total of 223 runs and his batting average is 32 runs
 data intelegence unit (DIU) ne dhoni ke ODI (ekadivasiy international) kariyar ke aankadon kaa vibhinn varshon main vishleshan kiya to paaya ki kaise kariyar ke aakhri padaav main unke pradarshan main giravat ai
 DIU analyzed Dhoni's career on these parameters - strike rate (average run per 100 balls), average ball played for every boundary (fours or sixes)
 kareeb apane dedh dashak ke kariyar main dhoni ne 348 match main 10,723 ran banaae jinamein unka batting ausat 50
 58 and strike rate 86
 data bataata he ki apane kariyar ke shuruuaati 3 saal main doni ne kareeb 100 strike rate se ran banaae
 As his career progressed, his strike rate decreased but he remained in the eighties
 haalanki 2017 ke baad se dhoni kaa batting strike rate ghatakar 80 par aa gaya
 This decline was particularly evident in the matches where India had to chase the target
 jin maichon main bharat ne baad main batting kii, 2017 ke baad se dhoni kaa strike rate 71 tak gir gaya
 Dhoni's name was the record for most sixes from India, but Rohit Sharma took this record in his name against Bangladesh
 dhoni ke naam 228 chakke or 1071 chauke hai
 If you look at these figures, Dhoni hit a boundary in every 12 balls of the face
 ye ausat unke kariyar ke shuruaati varshon main behatar tha
 Then on average, he used to put a boundary on every five balls of the face
 dhoni ab boundry lagane or ran gati ko badhaane ke liye sangharsh karte nazar aate hai, khaas taur par jab bharat lakshya kaa peechha kar rahaa hota he
 In the matches played since 2017, Dhoni is making a boundary on 19 balls of every face on an average
 haalanki jin maichon main bharat pehle batting karata he unamem dhoni ausatan phase kii har 9 gend par ek boundry laga rahe hai

 mishra ne bataaya, “kataareji niskriy na sabit hon isliye is tarah ke bebuniyaad aarope lagaate hai
 Arif Akil, PC Sharma, Gajendra Singh Rajukhedi, Arun Yadav, Hazari Lal Raghuvanshi and Tulsi Silavat are Congress leaders whose children have also taken admission in private medical colleges
 ” isi tarah bhargav ne daleel di, “mantri or netaaon ke bachche kahin na kahin to padhenge hi
 Making false accusations to create pressure is wrong
 ” jabaki camel patel ne do took kaha, “gold medalist bacchon ke daakhile par bhi sawaal uthenge to kya kaha jaae?” yani donon partiyon ke netaaon ne dimet ke jariye doctorl peshey main jigar ke tukdon kaa bhavishya sanvaarane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 How to get rid of exposed layers of scam before knowing what demat is really like? Just as Vyapam conducts Pre Medical Test (PMT) for admission to medical, similarly the Association for Private Medical and Dental Colleges (APMDC) conducts demat for the seats of management quota of private medical dental and colleges

 The first case of disturbance came up in Demat-2006, when the examination was canceled by the court

 But four months ago, when the Gwalior SIT arrested a broker named Atul Sharma in connection with the investigation of the Vyapam scam, he referred to a number of fake filings

 When Mohindra, who was already in jail, was questioned, he said that the name was sent to him by Yogesh Kumar Upriat

 After retiring from Vyapam, he started a dental college in Jabalpur

 Even the High Court and Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee spoke against private colleges but neither the state government nor the STF took any action on this issue
 ”maamle kii jaanch se jude ek adhikari ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya, “yah ghapala bhi vyapam ghotaale kii tarah hi he
 In this also the answer book of those people was filled through the demat officers who gave money in it
 yah sab nijee collejon ke saath milakar kiya gaya
 The role of brokers was also important in these examinations
 ”admician cancil karakar hota tha dimat main ghotalaisi baat nahin he ki nijee collejon kaa laalach sirf dimet cote tak hi simit rahaa ho, ye college state cote ko bhi hajam karne main jute rahe
 Many colleges found out the way that by paying money in the PMT exam, some senior students were seated
 piemti paas karne ke baad in chaatro ne in nijee collejon kii state cote kii seat par daakhila le liya or kuch din baad college se naam kataa liya
 In this way colleges became independent again to sell their seats at an expensive price

 While celebrating NCP President Sharad Pawar, who was angry with the government, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described him as a 'great asset' for the central government, while NCP made it clear that neither Pawar nor its other minister in the government Praful Patel Has resigned from the Union Cabinet

 He made it clear that ncp's resentment is about the way the government operates and this has been conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA and Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 is bich, pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pavaar ko manaate hue shuukravaar ko kaha, "vah behad moolyawaan sahyogi hai, jinaki jaankaree, buddhi tathaa anubhav hamaari sarkaar ke liye behad mahatvapurn hai
 " vahiin, patel ne kendriya mantrimandal se pavaar ke istife kii atakalon ko khaarij karte hue sarkaar se alag hone kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 After a nearly two-hour meeting of other NCP leaders, including Tariq Anwar and DP Tripathi, Patel told reporters, "till now we have not formally resigned
 
 Its question does not arise
 or phir mudda istife kaa he bhi nahin
 " isse pehle pavaar kii kareeb 30 minute tak congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se unke 10 janpath sthit awaas par mulaakaat hui thi
 According to the lists, it seems that Sonia managed to persuade the angry Pawar
 samprag main sankat ke sanket tab mili the jab pavaar or patel guuruuvaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main hui mantrimandal kii baithak main nahin pahunche
 There was speculation that the two NCP leaders resigned from the cabinet due to Pawar not getting number two position in the government
 lekin patel ne shuukravaar ko aisi atakalon ko 'bakawaas' qaraar dete hue kaha ki 'congress ke kuch varg hi' 'galat tareeke' se aisi baaten uthaa rahe hai or media main unhen 'sutron' ke naam par uchhaala ja rahaa he
 At the same time, Janardan Dwivedi, president of the Congress's media department, declined to comment on this
 unhone kaha, "ham apane gathbandhan sahyogiyon par tippanee nahin karte
 "comments patel ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ke saath kuch muddon par isaki asahmati bahut pehle se he, lekin ise raashtrapati chunaav se pehle nahin uchhaala gaya
 He said, "we decided to send our message only after the voting ends at 5 pm on Saturday
 " Patel said that the NCP wants the government to prepare for the 2014 general elections
 unhone kaha, "rakanpa pichley aath saal se sarkaar kii sabase adhik jimmedaar sahyogi he or yah isaki majbootee kaa ek stambh he
 We feel that general elections are going to be held in the next two years
 aise main sarkaar ko logon ke samaksh adhik nirnayaatmak or logon ke samaksh muddon ke saath adhik patibaddhta ke saath pesh hona chahie
 " sarkaar se naaraaz chal rahi rakanpa ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ko manaate hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne jahaan unhen centre sarkaar ke liye 'mahaan smapda' bataaya, vahiin rakanpa ne saaf kiya ki na to pavaar or na hi sarkaar main shaamil iske ek anya mantri prafull patel ne kendriya mantrimandal se istipha diya he
 After a meeting of NCP leaders for nearly two hours on Friday, party leader and Union Heavy Industries Minister Patel also dismissed reports of resentment for not getting the position of number two in a conversation with reporters
 unhone spasht kiya ki rakanpa kii naaraazgi sarkaar ke sanchaalan ke tareekon ko lekar he or is bare main pradhanmantri manmohan singh tathaa samprag va congress kii adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko avgat kara diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, celebrating Pawar, said on Friday, "he is an extremely valuable ally, whose knowledge, intelligence and experience are extremely important for our government
" " At the same time, Patel rejected the speculation of Pawar's resignation from the Union Cabinet, there is no question of his separation from the government
 tarik anwar va deepi treepathi sahit rakanpa ke anya netaaon kii kareeb do ghante tak chali baithak ke baad patel ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "is samay tak hamane aupchaarik rup se istife nahin die hai

 And then the issue is not even about resignation
 " Earlier, Pawar met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his 10 Janpath residence for about 30 minutes

 He said, "we do not comment on our coalition partners

 unhone kaha, "hamane shanivaar ko shaam paanch baje matdaan samaapt hone ke baad hi apana sandesh bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 " patel ne kaha ki rakanpa chaahati he ki sarkaar varsh 2014 main hone vaale aam chunaav kii taiyaari kare
 He said, "NCP is the most responsible ally of the government for the last eight years and it is a pillar of its strength
 ham mahasoos karte hai ki agle do saal main aam chunaav hone vaale hai
 In such a situation, the government should be more decisive and more committed to the issues before the people

 england daure kaa hawala dete hue modi ne kaha ki prince charles bharat aakar nijee taur par mujhe nimantran dekar gaye, unhone mujhe nijee rup chitthee likhi
 India, without any discrimination by its behavior, with any country of the world, India did not talk eye to eye nor did it raise eye to eye with anyone but with an eye

 yaad rakhen, sar don breadman, sar vivian richards, riki ponting, alan border, javed miyandad, inzamam-ul-haq, sar gairi sobers main se koi bhi apni aakhri pari ke liye yaad nahin kiye jate, lekin sachin tendulkar kii kai paariyaan umdaa pariyon ke taur par hameshaa yaad kii jaati rahengi
 
 
 The last innings of Sir Don Bradman, who is said to be the biggest name of cricket, was extremely lackluster, and he was dismissed for zero after facing just two balls and by England leg-spinner Eric Hallies
 
 
 lekin is baat kii charchaa shaayad hi kabhi hoti he ki usase sirf ek test match pehle unhone apane 51wein test match main leeds par naabad 173 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 
 
 Sunil Gavaskar, who was once Sachin Tendulkar's role model, played his last innings in the same manner with which he started his career
 
 
 sunil gavaskar ne apana aakhri test match bengalooru main pakistan ke khilaaf khelaa tha, jisamen vah apana 35waan test shatak puraa karne se sirf chaar ranon se chook gaye the, lekin usase pehle apane 124wein test match main unhone 63 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 
 
 Brian Lara of the West Indies, who set the record for the biggest individual innings (400 not out) in Test cricket, was able to score 0 and 49 in the last two innings of his 131st Test, but just before that, in his 130th Test match, Lara repeated in Multan
 He won the heart of fans by hitting a century
 
 
 varsh 2004 main purv australian captain steve wa kii vidaai kii yaaden aaj bhi tazaa hai
 
 
 Steve Waugh had scored 40 and 80 in his last two innings and made him memorable
 
 
 ittfa he ki sidney main khele gaye usee test match main sachin tendulkar ne bhi 241 ranon kii naabad pari kheli thi, jise kai jaankaar bemisaal maanate hai
 
 
 For the last two and a half decades, Sachin Tendulkar's fans kept on wishing 'more' from him and he kept quenching and increasing the thirst of his fans
 
 
 ab eden gardens or mumbai ke vankhede stadium main khele jane vaale unke kariyar ke aakhri 199wein or 200wein test match main sachin ke chaahane vaale unase 'superman' jaisi ummiden laga rahe hai, or lagaataar sunai de rahe hai 'yah dil maange mor

 sharada chitfund ghotaalaa maamle (saradha scam) main supreme court buudhvaar ko tay karegaa ki kolkata police ke purv kamishnar rajeev kumaar ko sibiai kii hiraasat main diya jaae yaa nahin
 The Supreme Court told the CBI that if you prove that Rajiv Kumar did not cooperate in the investigation then we will order the arrest
 kolkata ke purv police kamishnar rajeev kumaar maamle main supreme court main mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai kii ore se solicytor general tushaar mehta ne daleel di kii sharada chitfund maamle main jammu kashmir main giraftaar kiye aropiyon se pashchim bengal police ko sidi or anya pukhta saboot mili the
 But Kolkata Police has not given that evidence to the SIT till now
 unhone kaha ki CBI ko saare saboot eemaandaaree se dene chahie the
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta further said that these are the most important evidence to reveal the scam and reach the real culprits behind it
 rajeev kumaar ne supreme court ke giraftaar se sarankshan dene kaa bejaan phayda uthaaya he
 Rajiv Kumar has been involved in destroying the evidence
 jab tak rajeev kumaar ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha nahin hoti, sach saamne nahin aayega
 We were given a CDR after requesting it several times for four years
 wo bhi aadhi adhuri
 The call detail of the three important mobile numbers used in this entire episode is also not complete
 unhone aage daleel di ki vidhannagar ilaake main police ne 6 or mobile nambaron kii sidiaar bhi he
 During the investigation, Vodafone has given all the details of the call details for the entire year to the Bengal Police and the administration
 lekin wo bhi jaankaree share nahin kar rahi bengal police
 After this, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that when custodial interrogation (inquiry into judicial custody) is so important, you should directly petition for this intention and give arguments on it
 pehle kii baaten karne kaa koi matlab nahin
 The Supreme Court asked the CBI to prove that the Kolkata Police Commissioner did not cooperate in the investigation
 agar ye sabit ho jaataa he to ham rajeev kumaar kii giraftaar kaa aadesh de denge
 The CBI has demanded the Supreme Court to withdraw its order, asking former Kolkata Commissioner Rajiv Kumar not to be arrested or to take stern action
 haalanki vahiin, CBI kii arzi par kolkata ke purv police kamishnar rajeev kumaar ne supreme court main jawaab daakhil kar diya he
 In the affidavit, Rajiv Kumar has said that action is being taken at the behest of BJP leaders Mukul Roy and Kailash Vijayvargiya
 rajeev kumaar ne apane daawey ke samarthan main audio clip bhi court main saunpi he
 In fact, the CBI has demanded the arrest, accusing Rajiv of erasing the evidence of the Saradha chit fund case

 In his Facebook post, Ashish writes, 'there is nothing new in the prohibition of entry into the neo-colonial clubs of Kolkata

 Senior Congress leader from Odisha admitted to involvement in mining scam, BJD said that by imposing fine of Rs 58,000 crore on 27 mining companies for alleged illegal mining, the bjd-led government has admitted itself to be involved in big loot of minerals

 He favored the cancellation of all mining leases and handing them over to the Odisha Mining Corporation of the state government

 ek samay tha jab varasivani congress kaa garh tha, lekin aaj is vidhansabha seat par bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 Congress District President Pradeep Jaiswal leads the ticket race, while the current Municipality President Vivek Patel is also among the contenders
 vahiin bhaajapa kii taraf se vartmaan vidhayak yogendra nirmal prabal daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, the names of Sanjay Singh Masani, Gaurav Pardhi, Chhagan Hanwat are also among the contenders
 vaise to vidhansabha ke chunavi samar main sidhaa muqabla congress or bhaajapa main hota he, lekin basapa apni chunauti pesh karti aa rahi he
 Perhaps this is the reason that both BJP or Congress is in search of such a face to ensure victory
