lekin donon kii yahi ladaai subah puja kii maut main tabdeel ho jaaegi, ye khud usne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Inspector Amitbharat, who is already married, revealed that Amit is already married
 uske do bachche bhi hai
 In such a situation, Amit and Pooja would not have married each other
 lekin bharat ke is bayaan se alag buudhvaar ko puja kii munhaboli bhabhi ushaa ne jo khulaasa kiya tha, wo bhi apane-aap main kam chaunkaane vaala nahin he
 Usha had said that she herself was told by Pooja that Amit had secretly married her and that she had also got abortion
 munhaboli bhabhi ke mutabik puja ne use apni or amit kii shaadi kii tasviren bhi bheji thi
 Who is Bankeezis? There was a fight that night between Amit and Pooja over a boy named Banki, he works in the Merchant Navy
 uskaa asli naam yatendra he
 Since he hails from Barabanki, his friends call him by the name of Banki
 bharat kii maane to uski or banki kii mulaakaat patrakarita ke dauraan hi hui thi
 Both were good friends
 lekin sirf is vajah se puja par ungali uthaanaa thik nahin he
 Inspector Amit under suspicion, Inspector Amit's role in this case has been under question since day one
 haalanki itnaa hone ke baavjood faridabad police ne keval us doctor dampatti ke khilaaf hi khudakushi ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya he, jinhone puja kii shikaayat police se kii thi
 The accused doctor has said that if someone does blackmailing with them and they go to the police, will they be made accused of committing suicide, that too after worshiping them, there was no talk of worshiping them
 
 nae sire se hogi jaandab itnaa sab kuch khulaasa ho jane or puja, amit or bharat kaa audio clip saamne aane ke baad faridabad police ne is maamle main nae sire se tamaam pahaluon ko khangaalane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 But still the investigation of the police in this case will be called one way and half incomplete because despite all that night, the police did not get medical examination of Bharat and Amreen present with Pooja on the spot
 agar sardiyon main afundakhana khub pasand karte hai to phir ye khabar aapke liye he
 Especially in winter people like to eat eggs because they are rich in nutrients and have a good amount of vitamin D
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki kis tarah keinda menzyada vitamin di paaya jaataa he
 If you know this, then you will be surprised and with this you will also start to check how the hen has given this egg! In fact, the chickens which are more in the sun have more nutrients and the amount of vitamin d in them

 reeding uniwarsity ne 270andonper ek shodh kiya jisamen paaya ki jo murgiyaan pijadon or dadabon se baahar khuli hawa or dhoop main rahati hai, unke andon main vitamin di zyada paaya jaataa he
 Chickens that remain locked in cages throughout the day have less amount of vitamin d in their eggs
 to isliye di jaati he raaj anda khaane kii salaah
 
 
 Organic farm chickens mostly live in the open
 isliye shodh main kaha gaya he kii organic farm se aane vaale andon main 25 hydroxy D3 kaa str zyada hota he jo insaanon kii sehat ke liye behatar he
 Research also suggests that 'free-range' eggs contain up to 2 micrograms of vitamin D
 vahiin argenic andon main 2
 2 micrograms and 1 in the rest
 7 microgram vitamin di paaya jaataa he
 Do you know the right time and time to drink green tea? Many guidelines suggest that an adult needs 10 micrograms of vitamin d daily
 vahiin bacchon ko sirf 7 se 8
 Only 5 micrograms is required
 vaise bataa den ki andey ke alaava vitamin di kii sabase zyada maatra machhlee jaise toona, sonman or markel main paaya jaataa he
 At the same time, vitamin d is also available from cheese

 ' The Supreme Court has ruled out a CBI probe under court supervision denying the possibility of any investigation into the 36 Rafale aircraft deal with French company Dassault
 supreme court ne 8
 There is no irregularity in the $ 7 billion defense deal
 mukhya nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki unhen aisa koi sakshya nahin mila jisase kaha ja sake ki sarkaar ne kisi nijee company ko phayda pahunchane ke liye france ke saath samjhauta kiya
 This decision of the Supreme Court has brought relief to the Central Government and the opposition's demand for a CBI inquiry has been rejected

 court main kendra sarkaar ne kaha he ki dasolt se qaraar main ofaset partner chunane kaa daaromadar france kii company ke paas tha
 But the question is that when the responsibility was left to Dassault in this deal between the Government of India and France, on what basis HAL, the aviation unit of the Government of India, fell behind a company that entered into the aviation sector after the agreement

 dilli main pani par jari jabardast siyasat ke bich dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ke chalange kaa jawaab diya he
 Kejriwal said, 'I do not want to do politics over water
 inamen se kisi ko bhi dilli ke pani se sarokaar nahin he
 Dirty politics is being done only on water
 meraa aap logon ke madhyam se ek hi nivedan he agar kahin ganda pani aa rahaa he to aap hamen bataaie ham thik kara denge'
 Earlier on Thursday, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan challenged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and said, "if Delhi's water is pure, then Arvind Kejriwal must declare that RO will be removed from all his offices, tap in all government meetings
" Water will be fed and Delhi government recommends mandating the water standard
 'iske alaava centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ke bich dilli ke pani kii jaanch karwaane ko lekar ek gatirodh bana hua he
 In the latest team, the names of the Director General and Deputy Director General of the Bureau of Indian Standards have been nominated by the Union Government on behalf of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, while Dinesh Mohania, vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board and member of Delhi Jal Board, on behalf of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal

 i have clearly said that in this, nominate the CEO or equivalent officer of DJB ', but the Delhi government is not ready to accept Paswan's demand
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se jab poocha gaya ki ramvilas paswan dilli jal board ke upaadhyaksh dinesh mohaniya ke naam par aapatti kar rahe hai to aise main kya dinesh mohaniya kaa naam saajha team se hataaya jayega to kejariwal ne kaha 'main is raajnneeti main nahin padana chahta

 He does not deny that there have been reports of Fawad taking over in his film, he has also read such news but he has not signed Fawad
 nitin ne kaha, 'shaayad kisi ne bahut khush hokar is tarah kii khabaren chalaa deen hongi
 We are not making a film with any Pakistani authority '
 jabaki pichley saal nitin ne ek jane maane akhbaar se kaha tha ki vah agle saal fawaad ke saath film kii shooting shuru kar sakate hai
 He has been signed for this film
 is vakt ham film ke liye actress kaa chayan karne main jute hai

 jab nitin se poocha gaya ki kya ye faislacennshke pakistani actors ko bain karne kii apil par liya gaya he, to unhone kaha ki koi bhi artist kisi dharm yaa desh se nahin hota
 They are like pigeons coming from across the border to carry the message of peace
 agar aap cricket, theatre, mujeec yaa filmon ko bain kar denge to shanti behaal karne kii antim ummid bhi chali jaaegi

 Therefore, under the Congress leadership, the Prime Minister and the Congress President regretted it twice

 uttarakhand vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii jeet ke baavjood jab harish ravat mukhyamantri nahin ban sake to news channelon ke liye masaaledaar ghatnakram paidaa ho gaya, lekin party kii fitrat ko jaanane waalon ko isse koi khaas hairat nahin hui
 Rather, his first curiosity was that how Rawat, who raised his rights, still remains the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs? Because failing in Congress is not as big a crime as it is being a leader to hold onto the public and make an identity
 isiilie ravat ke liye khatra abhi tala nahin he or congress is maamle main behad chatur he ki vivaad ke samay koi samjhauta nikaal liya jaae or baad main baagi ko thikaane lagaaya jaae
 This is going on in the case of Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh
 jagan ke pita or tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vaai
 s
 rajasekhar reddy kii mrityu ke turant baad jab jan-jowar jagan ke saath tha, tab congress ne unhen kisi had tak samajhakar nai party banane se roak liya
 And now that people have returned to their jobs, Jagan is counting the days in CBI custody
 dakshin ke mashhoor abhinayta chiranjeevi ko congress bade sabjbag dikhaakar apane saath lari, lekin baad main apane thikaanon par pade iskar vibhaag ke chhaapon ke baad yah superster raajnneeti kaa junior kalakaar banakar rah gaya
 The rise of Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra and Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal is also a result of the Congress's policy of not tolerating the veneration
 agar dilli main shila dikshit or rajasthan main ashok gahalot ko chhod den, to congress main kshetreey kaddavar netaaon kaa puri tarah safaya ho chukaa he
 How can Rawat become an exception in such a situation? According to political pundits, the Chief Minister was promised to make Rawat a cabinet minister along with all the promises during the controversy
 lekin ab dur-dur tak aisi kori sugabugahat najar nahin aa rahi
 On the other hand, Vijay Bahuguna is gradually strengthening his position
 unhone dhire se apane virdohi harak singh ravat kaa mantri ke taur par kad badhaayaa or turant baad sitarganj vidhansabha seat se namakan daakhil kar diya
 To deal with the situation, Harish Rawat has also chosen the path of fine diplomacy
 pehle unhone bahuguna mantrimandal main aadhe mantri apane kheme se banawaye to apane samarthak govind singh kunjwaal ko vidhansabha adhyaksh banavaane or mahendra singh maharaa ko rajyasabha bhijwane main kaamyaab rahe
 At the same time, the post of Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission has also been given to Rawat Samarthak Mayuk Meher
 in sabake baavjood ravat satta santulan ke taar ko dhilaa chhodana nahin chaahate
 This is the reason why Meher has not taken over despite becoming the vice president
 unki daleel he, ''main keval kursi hasil karnaa nahin chahta
 i will not handle the work till the government makes it clear that my plans made and approved will be implemented
 '' ravat samarthak dharchula se congress vidhayak harish dhami to sadan main kaali pattee pahanakar pahunch gaye
 The pro-rawat MLA Lalit Farswan is not tired of asking the question why senior mlas were not asked in the Bahuguna cabinet
 ravat jaanate hai ki sirf samarthakon ke ho-hallaa karne se maamla kaabo main nahin aayega
 That is why, in order to show their strength, they are starting the 'ghedera bachao-bachao Bachao' movement in early July
 gadhera choti jaldhara ko kehete hai
 Rawat says, "the movement will start with the blessings of Badrinath and Kedaranathji
" andolan main main logon ko paryaavaran ke prati jaagruk karuunga
 For this, there will be public meetings in different places
 ''itani uthapatak ke baavjood pradesh congress adhyaksh yashpal arya kaa maananaa he ki pradesh congress main kisi tarah kii gutbaji nahin he
 Subodh Uniyal, a MLA from Narendranagar, close to Bahuguna, draws attention to another aspect
 uniyaal kaa kahana he ki tikat vitaran main kai jagah khami rah gai
 His reference is to the assembly seats of Haridwar, Lok Sabha constituency of Rawat
 is loksabhaa kshetra kii 11 siton main se 8 siton par congress ko munh kii khaani padi thi
 In most of these seats, ticket distribution was done as per Rawat's wishes
 ravat par bhi aarope he ki chaheton ke chakkar main unhone kamjor pratyaashiyon ko tikat thamakar congress kii lutiyaa dubo di
 Uniyal said, "rawat is a senior leader and everyone has their own ambitions
 ''lekin lagata nahin ki congressi rahete hue mukhyamantri banane kii ravat kii mahatvakanksha puri hogi
 How long Rawat, who is 'hridayangam with a smile', will hide his smile in a smile and how long the Congress will ignore his activities will depend on the political sentiment of Rawat
 vaise congress kii style or uski maujuuda grahadasha ko ravat or unki party donon behatar jaanate hai

 Singh said that his party believes that the state government has proved to be a complete failure in dealing with Naxalite violence in Bihar and the main reason for this is the government's soft attitude towards Naxalites and indifference to the central initiative

 He said that Naxalites are also a part of the society, no one can deny that but it is also true that this group is a group of murderers and it should be dealt with under the law itself
 singh ne kaha ki congress kaa maananaa he ki pichley do dashakon ke dauraan chaahe rajd ho yaa jadyu donon hi chunaav jeetne ke liye naksaliyon kaa sahaara lete rahe hai or yahi kaaran he ki ugravadi sanghathanon ke viruddh kabhi bhi koi thos karrwai nahin kii gayi or hatyaron kaa yah samooh sarkari sangrakshan main faltaa-phulataa rahaa
 He said that even after the incident on August 29 in Lakhisarai, the state government had not taken any concrete initiative but only kept making statements and during this period, the Naxalites killed a hostage policeman
 singh ne kaha ki bihar sarkaar kii udaseenta kaa isse bada pramaan or kya ho saktaa he ki naksali hinsa main ghayal ek pulicekarmi kaa paanch din guzarane ke baad bhi uske sharir se goli nahin nikaali gayi he or vah patna medical kalege aspataal main jivan or maut ke bich jhul rahaa he
 He said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Home Minister called the meeting of Chief Ministers of the affected states in Delhi twice, considering the Naxalite violence as a major threat to the internal security of the country, but both times the Chief Minister of Bihar did not attend this meeting and Neither showed seriousness towards the special campaign against the Naxalites
 bihar pradesh congress ke pravaktaa ajit pratap singh ne kaha ki unki party naksali hinsa main shahid hue pulicekarmiyon ke prati shradhanjali arpit karti he tathaa shokakul parivaar ke prati samvednaa vyakt karti he
 He said that his party demanded the state government to provide compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the dependent family of the policemen killed in Naxal violence and to provide government job and accommodation to a family member

 Investigating agencies connected each other with hard work with scattered wires of about half a dozen cases against Abhishek Verma
 verma vahi shaks he, jo 2006 ke nausena waar room li maamle ke daag se chamatkaari tareeke se ubarkar south block ke pramukh 'manager’ ke taur par dobaaraa saamne aayaa tha
 But one of his associates (escrow fund manager) c
 edmonds alan ne 2012 main neuyork main jab nae saboot pesh kiye to vah phir pakad main aayaa
 The investigation of the cases going against him was about to reach the final end that the investigating agencies were seen colliding with a digital block
 sabooton kii buniyadavarma ke khilaaf sibiai ko mili zyaadaatar saboot ek buniyaad par tike hai
 That foundation is that he regularly sent a number of documents to Allen by email, which included details of bank accounts, business dealings and confidential documents
 yahi ve dastavej the, jo alan ne 2012 main saboot ke taur par saunpe the
 After this, the process of investigation started
 lekin ab sibiai ne daawa kiya he ki vah yah sabit nahin kar sakati ki inamen se ek i-mail idi evaherzigova@gmail
 com was used only and only by Varma
 adaalat main pesh report kahati he, 'jaanch ke dauraan yah sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa ki is i-mail idi kaa istemaal puri tarah se sirf verma hi karata tha
 In the case in which the CBI has filed a closure report, Verma is accused of producing an alleged fake letter of a CBI officer who gave him a clean chit in the 2009 Naval War Room Leak Case
 sibiai kii report haalanki abhi adaalat ne manjuur nahin kii he
 The reasons for discontinuing the investigation are listed in this
 inamen ek yah vajah bhi shaamil he ki jaali chitthee kaa koi pramanit labhaarthi nahin he
 Another important thing has been said that the email id's direct relationship with Verma could not be proved
 agar adaalat is report ko manjuur kar leti he, to yah verma ke khilaaf sarkari gopneeyata kanoon (oese) ke tahat chal rahe sabase samvedansheel maamalon main khud sibiai ke rukh ke khilaaf ja sakati he kyonki ye maamle isi aadhaar par tike hai kiverma ne is i-mail idise samvedansheel dastavej videsh bheje the
 Digital evidence Most of the evidence against Verma is in the hands of CBI and Enforcement Directorate
 ye saboot do saal pehle is hathiyaar saudagar se jhagada hone ke baad alan ne die the
 If the investigating agencies are unable to prove that Verma sent these documents to Allen by e-mail, then these cases may fall on their face
 i-mail idi ke ypi adress kaa peechha karte hue jaanch agenciyaan verma ke farmahouse pahunchi, jahaan ekmaatr kiraayedaar ke taur par usee kaa naam darj he
 Despite this, the CBI has said in the closure report that it cannot conclusively prove that it was Verma who used this email ID to send the documents
 is bare main alan ne india today se kaha, 'sibiai ke patr kii kathith jaalsaji ke maamle main adaalat agar yah closer report manjuur kar leti he, to bharat kii kai duusari adaalaton main uske khilaaf chal rahe sibiai or idi ke sabhi maamalon ke kanoonee taur par khaarij hone kaa rasta saaf ho jayega

 If you want a government job then never do it
 Keep this worker positive, you may be upset due to not getting internship but do not express your frustration

 For the past several days, the wall of Rampal supporters who had camped outside the ashram in Barwala, Hisar, is now crumbling
 prashasan ke aadesh ke baad badi sankhya main vahaan gherbandi karne vaale samarthak ab ghar waapas jane lage hai or iske saath hi kai rampal kii haqikat bhi saamne aa rahi he
 Supporters returning from the ashram say that they were forcibly detained inside the ashram and even forbidden to talk to the media
 kuch samarthak yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki pichley chaar dinon se khaane−pine ke liye kuch bhi nahin diya gaya tha
 Actually, on the court's order, the same supporters stood as a wall among the police who reached to arrest Rampal, due to which the whole administrative staff kept trying to arrest Rampal, but the success was not on his hands
 is bich court ne rampal ke kilaaf nayaa gaiyr-jamaanti warrant jari karte hue 21 taarikh ko use court main pesh karne ke aadesh die hai
 At the same time, the court has ordered the administration that Rampal should be compensated for the expenses incurred in the arrest efforts
 ek taraf dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang bayaan jari karke asibi par apana adhikaar jamaa rahe hai or kah rahe hai ki unke paas abhi tak aisa koi prastaav nahin aayaa he, jisamen bihar ke police adhikariyon ko dilli anti karpshan branch main niyukt karne kii baat ho or aayega to achche se jaanchenge or faisla karenge
 On the other hand, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia says that Delhi government and ACB have every right to appoint officers
 yah maamla court main bhi chal rahaa he phir bhi halaat aise kyon bane hue hai ki alji or dilli sarkaar phir se aamane-saamne aa gaye hai? jabaki shuukravaar ko hi supreme court or dilli hoicourt main is par sunwaayee hui thi
 In fact, neither did the Supreme Court make any comment on the Delhi acb's authority during the hearing on Friday 29 May, or put a moratorium on the Delhi High Court's order of 25 May, in which the ACB was given full authority to take action in corruption cases in Delhi
 Was
 or dilli hai court main bhi jab sunwaayee hui to court ne niyukti maamle main keval itnaa aadesh diya tha ki haal ke tabadale ke do aadesh prastaav ke taur par dilli sarkaar alji ko bheje, jis par vah charchaa karenge
 That is, because the court neither banned any action on Delhi government or ACB nor ordered any appointment (except for two orders), so the Delhi government believes that what it is doing is constitutional, right
 
 tippaniyan While LG is assuming that the court has not put any restriction on the notification and it has not been canceled, therefore what the Delhi government is doing is wrong and what they are saying is right and constitutional
 dekh lijiye kanoon or uske praavdhaanon kii vyakhya abhi tak donon apane hisaab se kar rahe the or bhide hue the, lekin ab court ke aadesh or sunwaayee kii vyakhya bhi donon apane hisaab se kar rahe hai, jisase maamla aaj bhi vahiin par fansaa hua he jahaan pehle tha

 This matter is going on in the court as well, yet why are the circumstances such that LG and Delhi government have come face to face again? While the hearing was held in the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court on Friday itself
 asal main na to shuukravaar 29 may ko sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne dilli asibi ke adhikaar par koi tipanni kii yaa phir dilli hoicourt ke 25 may ke aadesh par koi roak lagaai, jisame asibi ko dilli main karpshan maamalon main karrwai kaa purna adhikaar bataaya gaya tha
 And when the hearing was held in the Delhi High Court also, the court had given only such order in the appointment case that the two recent transfer orders should be sent to the Delhi Government LG as a proposal, which they will discuss
 yani kyonki court ne dilli sarkaar yaa asibi par kahin kisi tarah kii karrwai par na to koi roak lagaayee na koi niyukti ko lekar aadesh diya (do adeshon ke atirikt) isliye dilli sarkaar maanati he ki wo jaisaa kar rahi he vahi sanvaidhanik he, sahi he
 The comments jabaki alji yah maan rahe hai ki notification par court ne koi roak nahin lagaai or na hi ye radd hua he isliye dilli sarkaar jo kar rahi he vah galat he or vah jo kah rahe hai vahi sahi or sanvaidhanik he
 See, both were interpreting the law and its provisions till now, and were confronting it, but now both the court order and the hearing are being interpreted according to their own, so that the matter is still stuck where Was earlier

 bharat ke sabase pratishthit medical santhaan ames main doctoron se ilaaj karwaanaa ab bahut aasaan ho gaya he
 The premier institute receives an average of 8,000 patients every day and hence it is always cluttered
 doctoron se mil paanaa behad kathin ho jaataa he lekin ab doctoron ko dikhaanaa aasaan ho gaya he
 The hospital has made a new arrangement, under which now time can be taken from the doctors by phone
 yah khabar ek angreji akhbaar ne di he
 According to him, this arrangement has started from August 15
 akhbaar ne ames ke diarector doctor emasi mishra ke hawaale se bataaya ki ab har din 1500 kol doctoron se samay lene ke liye aa rahe hai
 Every caller is given a number called a UHID number
 is number se hi unhen vahaan samay miltaa he
 Patients have to call the institute's phone number 09266092660 for this
 yah kol ek kol centre main transfar kar diya jaataa he jo khaas vibhaag ke liye tithi or samay book karata he
 But the condition is that there is availability on that day
 isamen angreji or hindi main baat kii ja sakati he
 After this a list is given to the concerned doctor and it is also displayed
 santhaan is baat ke liye bhi prayaas kar rahaa he ki lab report online bhi uplabdh karai jaae
 This will reduce congestion there and patients will also get rest
 agar romaanch kii baat kii jaae to dilli ke vidhansabha chunaavon ne tii-20 cricket ko bhi peeche chhod diya he
 Three weeks before the vote, the electoral situation in Delhi is changing every hour, due to the rapid change in the voters of Delhi and other parts of the country as well
 jab chunaav kii baaten shuru ho rahi thim, jab tak aisa maahaul tha ki modi lahar par savaar bijepi ko badhat hasil he or kejariwal kii chunauti lahar ko thaamne kii he
 But soon the fija changed, both BJP and aap's strategies felt like Kejriwal's party had a heavy upper hand and it was bjp's turn to try
 uske baad jab kejariwal ne pradesh bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay kii kundali saarvajanik kii to laga ki aap ne baaji maar lee
 The same thing happened to some extent
 kal tak sabase aage najar aane vaale upaadhyaay achaanak haashiye par chale gaye or haalat yah hui ki unhen vidhansabha kaa tikat tak nahin mila
 He spoke of filing a defamation case against Kejriwal, but his claim did not get the customers
 chunaav ke shuru main bijepi kaa nayaa cheharaa sa dikhne vaale upaadhyaay ab party par boj najar aa rahe hai
 Any big and especially the party winning most of the states in the center and the country would have responded to this attack in their own style
 lekin bijepi ne badi furti dikhaai
 The next day, the party brought in former IPS officer Kiran Bedi
 party is baat se nahin hitchkee ki log kya kahenge? kyonki yah sawaal to uthanaa hi tha ki aakhir loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se saare vidhansabha chunaav bina chehre ke ladane vaali bijepi ko dilli main chehre kii jarurat kyon padi?kya iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki modi ke jis chehre par puure desh main party ko bharosa he vah dilli main naakaafi he
 The second type of question is whether the party is afraid of losing in Delhi? In such a situation, she wants to describe bjp's defeat as Kiran Bedi or local leadership's defeat
 amit shah ke netritv vaali party kii jagah koi or party hoti to satta ke oonche mukaam par pahunchane ke baad isi tarah kii paaramparik soch dikhaati, lekin amit shah bahut furtile hai
 That is why when he announced Kiran Bedi as bjp's chief ministerial candidate on January 19 at 11 pm, he said on similar questions of journalists, "the party will not run away from your questions
" party kaa acha bura hamen maaloom he
 "seeing the ground reality, the Congress could never show this ability to make fundamental changes in strategy when it was at the top of power
" vakt kii nabj ko na samaj paane ke kaaran hi uske kshatrap bikharate rahe or desh main tisare morche kii partiyon ke phool congress ke puraane netaaon ne khilaa die
 BJP took that lesson very quickly from the history of Congress, which Congress is not able to take even in its worst time
 doosraa kaam bijepi ne yah samajhadaari kaa kiya ki aap kii tamaam chunautiyon ke baavjood kiran bedi ko krishna nagar jaisi mahfuj seat se tikat de diya
 With this, the speculation of him fighting against Kejriwal from New Delhi came to an end
 jabaki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kejariwal ne shila dikshit ke khilaaf or phir loksabhaa main banaras se narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladqar aisi ranneeti banaai thi jisamen raja se sidhe raja takaraae
 There is an element of sensation and news in this strategy but traditions have always been against it
 parampada to pyaade ko vajeer se pitwane kii he
 This is what the BJP is following
 chunavi bisaat kii pehali chaal agar kejariwal ke paksh main gai to doosraa daanv bijepi ne maaraa he
 Congress' Ajay Maken is having fun by tweeting in between, but is unable to present the party in a weighty manner
 vaise bhi congress jab tak 2 lakh kii bheed jutakar dilli main badi raily nahin karti tab tak uske panje kii lakeeren badalane vaali nahin hai
 In such a situation, Kejriwal is throwing a new dice again
 unhone bedi ko bahes kii chunauti di he, jisase bedi badi safai se kanni kaat gayi
 Kejriwal will soon be coming up with new tricks
 dekhnaa yah he ki bijepi ne uskaa surakshachakra pehle se hi bana rakhaa he yaa halaat ko dekhakar turant banaaegi
 There are many shocking scenes yet to come at the electoral theater, so know that
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke mantriyon par bhrashtachar kaa sidhaa aarope lagaate hue congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne kaha ki centre sarkaar ne bundelkhand ke garib kisaanon ke vikaas ke liye paisa bheja tha na ki pradesh ke mantri nasimuddin siddki ke rishtedaaron ke tractor kharidne ke liye
 He said that the money was not spent in the right place
 rahul ne kaha ki isi tarah centre sarkaar ne swasthya sevaaon ke liye paisa bheja tha na ki mantriyon or adhikariyon ke khaane ke liye
 Due to this, a minister is caught in the CBI investigation and is traveling to Delhi to save himself
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne maati mukhyalay par congress dwaara yojit ek ati pichhadaa varg raily ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Encouraged by the huge crowd gathered at the rally, Rahul Gandhi said that the central government sends money to the Uttar Pradesh government for various welfare schemes and not for the ministers and officials of the state
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen bada dukh hota he jab pradesh kii garib janata ko kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh nahin mil paata he
 This is the loss of every section of the state
 ’ rahul ne kaha ki bundelkhand ke kisaan apni garibi or durdasha kii baat lekar un tak pahunche the to unhone pradhanmantri se kahkar bundelkhand ke liye vishesh package kii vyavastha karai thi
 But now he comes to know that the state's Public Works Minister Nasimuddin Siddiqui has invested the money for development of Bundelkhand in providing tractors to his relatives instead of giving it to the common farmers and the poor
 rahul ne kaha ki isi tarah centre sarkaar ne pradesh kii swasthya yojanaon ke liye karodon rupee kii dhanrashi uttar pradesh sarkaar ko di
 The state ministers and officials also got together and distributed the money, which the former minister of the state is now suffering, and he is traveling in Delhi to save himself by getting caught in the cbi's affair
 rahul kaa ishaara purv mantri baburam kushvaha kii taraf tha lekin unhone unka naam nahin liya
 Rahul said that due to non-spending of welfare schemes in Uttar Pradesh, people here have to leave their families for employment and run towards cities like Delhi, Mumbai
 rahul ne sawaal kiya ki jin mazdooron ne dilli main metro rail kaa nirmaan kiya he, kya ve majdoor us metro main chadhane kii haisiyat rakhte he? unhone kaha ki agar apane pradesh main rojgaar ke saadhan uplabdh hote to aaj pradesh kii janata ko rojgaar ke liye apane parivaar or bacchon ko chhodkar duusare pradeshon main nahin janaa padataa
 Rahul said that in the name of development in the last 22 years only politics of caste and religion has taken place
 bhaajapa ne dharm or bhagwaan ke naam par pradesh ko lutaa, samaajavaavadi party ne jati ke naam par lutaa or bahujan samaajawaadee party kaa hathi to keval paisa hi khaataa he
 Pointing to the state of the state, Rahul said that in the last 22 years you have chosen different governments and see the result that you are constantly falling behind
 ab ham aap se vaayada karte hai ki paanch varshon ke liye congress sarkaar ko mauka de or uske baad aap fark ko dekh le
 You will not have to go to other states to ask for employment, rather people from other states will come here to ask for employment
 unhone janata se congress ko baari maton se jitaane kaa anurodh kiya
 The Brahmin organizations in Jaipur performed the Parashurama Shobhayatranikali on Sunday
 is dauraan ek thana prabharee par aapattijanak tippanee or farsa chhinane kaa aarope lagaate hue logon ne hangaamaa kiya or hathapayee bhi kii
 In protest, people of the Brahmin community laid siege to the police station for about 2 hours
 baad main jab thana prabharee ko haath jodakar maafee maangani padi tab jaakar maamla shant hua
 According to the information received, Brahmin organizations took out a procession from the Khania Hanuman temple in Jaipur to the 52 feet Hanuman temple
 is yatra kii police prashasan ne pehle se anumati di thi
 Then, as soon as the rally reached the old octroi, some people started committing uproar
 unka aarope tha ki kho-nagoriyaan thana prabharee indraj marodia nebhagwan parashuramke liye aapattijanak tippanee kii
 On hearing this, people became angry and started shouting slogans
 is dauraan kuch logon ke saath thana prabharee va anya pulicekarmiyon kii hathapayee hui
 Seeing the matter growing, some people involved in the rally took the police station in-charge and took him away
 baad main thana prabharee indraj marodia ne varisht adhikariyon ke saamne haath jodakar maafee maangi tab jaakar maamla shant hua
 Also, there was a written agreement that the two sides would not take any action
 bataa den ki is maamle ke baad thana prabharee indraj marodia chuttee par chale gaye hai
 However, till now Jaipur Police has not given any explanation about this
 haath jodakar maafee maangithana prabharee indraj ne logon ke saamne haath jodakar kaha ki-meri bhaavana galat nahin he
 i do not want to offend anyone
 yadi kisi ko laga ho ki maine dharm yaa samudaay vishesh ke liye kuch galat kaha he to nisancoch haath jodakar maafee maangata hum
 i refused to have a weapon because if someone was hurt by the weapon, all responsibility was mine
 phir bhi koi aahat hua he to main haath jodakar or paanv pakadakar maafi maangata hum

 vahiin pragna yah sochati he ki aakhir purab ne abhi ke saamne yah kyon kaha ki vah usase pyaar karata he
 After this, Purab comes into the room and Pragya asks him why did he do this? Pragya tells him that this action will increase the distance between him and Abhi
 vahiin daadi bhi usase bahut zyada naaraaz hoti hai
 The comments purab pragna se kahata he ki vah use apni badi bahan kii tarah maanata he or usne jo kuch bhi kiya, abhi or pragna ko milaane ke liye kiya
 She said that when Alia and Tanu were accusing them, he understood that she was planning something against them, so she did not say anything
 purab ne kaha ki aalia or tanu ko lag rahaa he ki ve donon jeet gai hai lekin unki yah khushi zyada dinon tak nahin tikegi
 Purabh says that Abhi will be jealous of his saying that he loves Pragya and he will say all the things in his heart

 Former Union Minister Milind Deora on Wednesday opened a front against Rahul Gandhi's advisors
 milind devda ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko salaah dene vaale log thik nahin hai
 They have no knowledge of ground reality, nor experience of elections
 lekin jo log salaah lete hai, jimmedaari unhen bhi leni padati he
 At the same time, Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi has also raised the voice of criticism by justifying Milind Deora's point
 haalanki congress ke bheetar devda ke bayaan kii aalochana bhi shuru ho gai he
 Rajya Sabha MP Hussain Dalwai has raised questions on Milind Deora's contribution to the party
 mumbai south sansadeey seat se chunaav haarane vaale devda ne angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' se kaha ki congress kii haar ke peeche 'kai factor' hai or iske liye sirf rahul gandhi ke netritv ko hi doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 He said, 'it was not about the image of a person, but about the people around him
 'my comments are out of emotions of deep loyalty to the party, pain of our performance & a sincere desire to see us bounce back

 There was a whisper in the party that those who were taking decisions had no experience in elections
 na hi party main unka kad, stand, sammaan or vishwasaneeyata thi
 He was in charge of key departments and held important positions
 in logon ke samooh ne party kader or saansadon kii baat nahin suni
 They prevented different views from coming into the discussion and silenced some people
 hamamen se kai jaanate the ki party udasin ho chali he
 If the system had been a little open and inclusive and everyone's views had been heard, reform measures could have been taken
 'pichhali loksabhaa main soochna va prasaaran rajya mantri milind devda ne kaha ki party ke bahut saare logon ko lagata tha ki unki baat nahin suni ja rahi he
 He started to feel that his opinion did not matter

 He said, 'rahul's advisors do not have experience

 He is close to Rahul
 mujhe nahin lagata ki haar kii vajah galat salaab he
 Milind Deora has no contribution to the party
 iske baavjood unhen tikat diya gaya or mantri banaaya gaya, sirf unke pita (murali devda) kii vajah se
 "those seeking advice also have to take responsibility", while taking Rahul Gandhi too, Milind Deora said, "it is not just a matter of advisors
" salaah lene vaale logon ko bhi jimmedaari uthaani padati he
 Everyone has to take responsibility for the advice they give, the advice they take and those who think they could have given better advice
 ' kisi kaa naam liye bina milind devda ne kaha ki ab ekmaatr tarika yahi he ki party ko thodaa kholaa jaae or virodh or bahes kii andruni awaajon ko jagah di jaae
 He called for free and open discussion in the party and the need to ensure accountability

 british akhabaaron main khulkar gujarat dangon or ashishnutaa ke sawaalon ko uthaaya gaya he or guard of honor dene par sawaal kiye gaye hai
 The New York Times and Washington Post have also featured criticism of the Prime Minister's policies in recent times

 Investors are now starting to stretch their hands
 vivekanand foundation ke sushant sareen ne likhaa he ki pradhanmantri ke daure kii ye khaasiyaten ab puraani padane lagi hai
 The essence of Sushant's article is that the seriousness of the Prime Minister's visit is lost in the spectacle of events like Wembley
 vivekanand foundation ke kai log sarkaar kii soch ke kareeb maane jate rahe hai
 Has Prime Minister Modi's foreign visits now clouded the questions, events like Madison to Wembley give a new dimension to foreign policy or reduce their seriousness
 kahin wo pehali baar jate hai to kahin dashakon baad jane vaale pehle pradhanmantri ho jate hai
 The first mention is made on some excuse
 fiji, bhutan, mongolia, nepal, morishas, australia or britain kii sansad ko sambodhit karnaa, salaami se lekar mulaakaat tak kuch aisa hona jo pehali baar hota he yaa bahut dinon baad hota he
 Issues such as permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council and definition of terrorism are permanent and India's relations with each country are said to be stronger than before
 britain ko europea sambandhon kaa pravesh dwaar bataate hai to australia main jaakar pradhanmantri kehete hai ki 28 saal lag gaye kisi bhartiya pradhanmantri ko australia aane main lekin ab chizein badalengi or australia hamaare vijan ke haashiye par nahin balki centre main hoga
 Comparing the speech style of the Prime Minister with his foreign tours at the election meetings of Bihar, there are exactly two different figures
 bahut se log maanate hai ki duniya ke nakshe par bharat ko lekar kuch nayaa ho rahaa he
 The visit of Prime Minister Maudi is changing the image of India
 unki yatra jab bhi aadhakarik charan main hoti he tamaam news channelon par ek hi tarah ke angel se shot chalane lagate hai
 a special kind of discipline is formed
 ek bane banaaye frem main pradhanmantri kaa har kadam pehle se sochaa samajha lagata he
 Foreign policy experts should also include the cameras' eyesight in diplomatic analysis
 kis tarah helicopter se liya gaya british sansad kaa shot ek alag kisse kii rachana karata he
 The top angle shot shows the depth of the Parliament and suddenly the position of the Prime Minister begins to be something else in the mind of the spectator sitting in distant India
 aisa hota he yaa nahin daawey ke saath nahin kah saktaa lekin jab camera chackers main pradhanmantri modi or british pradhanmantri camerun ko dekhtaa he tab donon tej hawaaon ke khilaaf badhate chale ja rahe hote hai
 This picture creates a special kind of intimacy, despite this, in the checkers, from the President of Pakistan to the President of China has also gone last month
 mujhe videsh dauron kaa behatar gyaan nahin he isliye nahin bataa saktaa ki chini raashtrapati ke daure ko camaron ne khaas nazar se cover kiya tha yaa nahin
 Just as the President's residence in India is in Shimla and Hyderabad, the rural government residence of the British Prime Minister is checkers
 ye saare drishy aam se aam aadmi ko sakasham karte honge ki wo bhi videsh niti ko samaj saktaa he
 In 1985, when US President Regan caught the umbrella for Rajiv Gandhi, there was a lot of sensation in India
 pradhanmantri modi ke saath aise kisson kii bharmaar he
 Remember when the audio cassette era was used to ask how much of the live recording of the Royal Albert Hall in London
 ghazal or geet ke saath taaliyon kii gadgadaahat kii dhwani atirikt sangeet kii rachana karti thi
 Jagjit Singh, Lata Mangeshkar and Amitabh Bachchan
 baad main bollywood ke star apni event team lekar duniya bhar main kooch karne lage
 Adjectives such as Blockbuster and Rockstar have started to suit Prime Minister Modi's foreign tours
 landan ke wemble stadium main unke kaarykram ke liye jo paas jari kiye gaye hai us par sho likhaa he
 In the stadium part of his tour, the Prime Minister transforms into a show man
 america kaa medicin scavyar ho yaa australia kaa aalfons arina
 Wembley in London is a very expensive stadium

 But the Prime Minister is also facing opposition in this visit
 sitambar maheene main sanyukt raashtra ke mukhyalay ke saamne pradhanmantri modi kii yatra kaa virodh hua tha jo landan tak aate aate mukhar ho gaya he
 Questions of Gujarat riots and intolerance have been openly raised in British newspapers and questions have been raised about the Guard of Honor
 haal ke dinon main neuyork times or washington post main bhi pradhanmantri kii nitiyon kii aalochana chhapi he
 The British newspaper The Telegraph, Guardian and Time have featured articles in which they have been severely criticized

 3 fisadi
 Growth rate 3 in September
 6 fisadi hi rahaa
 75% of the index of factory output comes from the manufacturing sector with growth rate of 2
 6 pratishat hi dekha gaya he
 The earnings of companies have also declined sharply
 upabhokta mulya suchakank bhi oktober main 5 fisadi ho gaya he
 The first news from the Economic Times is that investment for start-up companies has started to decline
 niveshak ab apana haath khinchne lage hai
 Sushant Sarin of the Vivekananda Foundation has written that these characteristics of the Prime Minister's visit are now getting old
 sushant ke lekh kaa saar yah he pradhanmantri ke daure kii gambhirtha wemble jaise aayojanon ke tamaashe main kho jaati he
 Many people of the Vivekananda Foundation have been considered close to the thinking of the government
 kya pradhanmantri modi ke videsh daure par ab sawaalon ke badal mandaraane lage hai, medicin se lekar wemble jaise aayojan videsh niti ko koi nayaa aayam dete hai yaa phir unki gambhirtha ko kam kar dete hai
 Many people believe that something new is happening about India on the world map
 pradhanmantri maudi kaa daura bharat kii chhavi ko badal rahaa he
 Whenever his journey is in half-term phase, shots are started from the same angle on all the news channels
 ek khaas kism kaa anushaasan ban jaataa he
 In a made-up frame, every step of the Prime Minister seems to be understood in advance
 videsh niti ke jaankaron ko camaron kii nigahon ko bhi kootnithik vishleshan main shaamil karnaa chahie
 How the British Parliament shot from a helicopter creates a different story
 top angel shot se sansad kii gaharaai nazar aati he or dur bharat main baithe darshak ke man main achaanak pradhanmantri kii haisiyat kuch or hone lagati he
 Whether it happens or not can not say with assertion, but when the camera sees Prime Minister Modi and British Prime Minister Cameron in the checkers, both are moving against the strong winds
 yah tasviir khaas kism kii antarangta kii rachana karti he jabaki is baat ke baavjood chackers main pakistan ke raashtrapati se lekar pichley maheene china ke raashtrapati bhi ja chuke hai
 i do not have a good knowledge of foreign tours, so i cannot tell whether the Chinese President's visit was covered by cameras in particular
 jis tarah se bharat main raashtrapati kaa nivas shimla or hyderabad main hota he usee tarah britain ke pradhanmantri kaa gramin sarkari nivas he chackers
 All these scenes will enable the common man that he too can understand foreign policy
 1985 main america raashtrapati regan ne jab rajeev gandhi ke liye chaataa pakadaa tha to bharat main kaaphi sansani faili thi
 There are a lot of such stories with Prime Minister Modi
 yaad kiijie jab audio casette kaa zamana tha tab landan ke royal albert haal kii live recording kii kitni puch hoti thi
 The sound of thunderous applause along with ghazals and lyrics created additional music
 jagajeet singh, lata mangeshkar or amitabh bachchan

 After a continuous defeat, the Congress is in a period of self-churn and the party is considering a variety of formulas, but the plans of Vice President Ahul Gandhi have been sidelined

 But the party has now rejected it and asked for maximum consent

 But the thing to note is that many people found the film so frightening that 100 people left during the screening

 With the start of the new year, US President Donald Trump has attacked Pakistan, a refuge of terrorism
 saath hi pakistan ko tagada jhatka dene kii taiyaari kar lee he
 At the same time, this caused panic in Pakistan
 trump ke bayaan se tilamilaae pakistan ne bhi karaara jawaab dene kii baat kahi he
 In the name of action against terrorism, Pakistan has always misled the world including America, but now everyone has understood this trick
 yahi vajah he ki nae saal ke shuru hoti halmerica raashtrapati donald trump ne aatankwaad ko lekar pakistan ko jamkar latada he
 Trump said that Pakistan has only fooled the US so far in the name of taking action against terrorism
 unhone kaha ki america pichley 15 saalon main pakistan ko 33 arab dollar se zyada kii sahaayta de chukaa he, lekin usne hamen jhooth or chal-kapat ke alaava kuch nahin diya
 Pakistan considers our leaders foolish
 The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools
 They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help
 No more!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) January 1, 2018 He said that the US was not yet able to understand the nefarious move of Pakistan, but now everything is clear
 america pakistan ke aatankwaad prem ko puri tarah samaj chukaa he
 Donald Trump, while giving a clear message to Americans about terrorism, said, "pakistan has so far considered our leaders foolish
 15 varshon main pakistan ko 33 arab dollar kii america madad di gai, jo ek tarah se bekaar gai, kyonki pakistan ne aatankwaad par kabhi lagaam hi nahin lagaaya
 "at the same time, stunned by this statement, Pakistan has said to answer to America
" trump ke bayaan ke baad pakistani videsh mantri khwaja asif ne pradhanmantri shahid khaakaan abbasi se mulaakaat kii
 Khwaja Asif tweeted, "we will soon respond to US President Donald Trump's tweet
" inshallah duniya ko hakeekat kaa pataa chal jayega
 
 
 
 
 There is a difference between a fact and a fictional story
 ''we will respond to President Trump's tweet shortly inshallah
 
 
 Will let the world know the truth
 
 difference between facts & fiction

 pakistan ko america se milane vaali madad bhi band ho jaaegi
 He was promoting terrorism with this help

 company kaa daawa he ki megi main lead kii jo maatra maapi gai he, uskaa tarika galat he
 Also it is wrong to measure Maggi's spice and its noodle separately
 nestle kaa kahana he ki megi ko bain karnaa or nestle ko apane product market se waapas lene kaa aadesh dena, donon hi galat he
 The company has petitioned the Bombay High Court to stay the order of the FSSAI
 nestle india kaa kahana he, 'ham bazaar se megi utpaadon ko waapas le rahe hai
 This process will not be affected by filing a petition in court
 'gauratlab he ki khaadya suraksha athurity dwaara megi kii jaanch main atyadhik maatra main sheesha milane ke baad company ko bazaar se megi waapas lene kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 Many states have also banned Maggi
 FSSAI ne jaanch ke daayre menoodles or pasta jaise anya brandonko bhi shaamil kiya he
 On the other hand, Maggi units of Nestle have started retrenchment of employees

 According to sources, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said that information related to the accounts of Indians in foreign banks has been made available under international treaties
 agar inhen saarvajanik kar degi to bhavishya main koi sarkaar aisi jaankaree nahin degi
 According to sources, it was stressed in the meeting that such information has been made available solely for the purpose of taxation and the government will take this step without making the name public

 It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the government for not providing information about black money stashed in foreign banks

 Shiv Sena has described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent statements about cow protection and Dalits as film dialogue
 shivasena saansad sanjay raut ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki piem modi ko farji gorakshakon kii list saamne laana chahie
 Special conversation with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on the statement of the Prime Minister on cow protection and Dalits - Question - Sanjayji who came to the statement that 80 percent cow guards are fake
 us bayaan ko lekar ke viechpi naaraaz he or sadhu sant or kuch gauraksha se jude sanghathan ki aise bayaan par maafee maangi chahie?sanjay raut- jo 80 percent farji gorakshak unke sanghathan sanstha hai
 Who are these fake people? The Prime Minister should bring his entire list to the people
 yah pehali maang he
 Till today, in 2-3 years, these fake people were doing this fraud
 ab tak saamne kyon nahin aayaa? peeche koun log hai? agar sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he to vah bhi saamne aana chahie
 Therefore, whether it is a fake businessman or a guard
 is desh main farji kuch nahin chalegaa
 We still felt that all the Gorakshakavis belong to the Hindu Council, belong to the RSS
 bajrang dal ke hinduvadi sanghathan ke log hai
 There are people of saints and saints
 lekin pradhanmantri kehete hai ki farji log hai to mujhako yah mudda bahut hi gambhir or bada lagata he
 If the Prime Minister feels fake in the name of Hindu protector, then it is a big issue
 sawaal- do saal ke baad pradhanmantri ko laga, yah sawaal uthaa he ki karrwai kyon nahin kii gai ?sanjay raut- do saal main hi kyon paidaa ho gaye? yah sawaal hamane uthaaya tha ki do saal main hi yah hajaaron lakhon gorakshak kaise paidaa ho gaye? is bare main jaanch honi chahie
 If it is fake, we do not believe it to be fake
 usamengorakshashraddha kaa vishay he
 Some anti-social elements must have entered it
 lekin jo 80 percent kii kii baat kahi he
 It can get angry
 sawaal- pradhanmantri ne gorakshak hi nahin daliton ko lekar bhi bayaan diya he ki mujhako goli maar lo, daliton par atyaachaar mat karo
 How do you see this statement? Sanjay Raut- Do not shoot Kikashmiri Pandits if they add the name of Kashmiri Pandits to the Dalits as well
 daliton ko goli mat maaro
 So Shiv Sena would have enjoyed a lot
 is prakaar ke dialog hamane filmi parde par sune hai
 The Prime Minister has his own sentiment
 pradhanmantri ke munh se goli maarane kii baat acchhee nahin lagi he
 Till now people like such things in salim-javed's dialogue
 pradhanmantri desh kii asmita hai
 Is the identity of the nation
 hamaare himmatvar pradhanmantri ko ection kii baat kerani chahie
 Shot will do nothing
 desh ko unke bayaan se dukh hua he
 We like the Prime Minister
 chaahate hai ki vah 25 saal raaj karen

 andhera isliye adhik tha, ki main seedhiyaan chadhate-chadhate mahasoos kar rahaa tha ki mere paanv waapas laut janaa chaahate hai
 While i was talking to him on the phone, i was still thinking that i should suddenly hang up the phone, stop talking

 i have been equally afraid of aristocracy

 i enter into fearless and cold rooms of directors of big companies
 alshesian or terriaron se meraa parichay he
 But i am scared of aristocracy
 bachapan desi riyasaton main beetaa he, or tab beetaa he, jab riyasaton ke maalik or nawab shikaar khelte the, or europe jate the, or gavaiyon or pahalawaanon ko paalate the, bijness form nahin kaayam karte the, congressi tikat se ellection main nahin khadey hote the, gandhi topi nahin pahante the
 Now that time is no longer there, but i am afraid of aristocracy
 isliye, phone par irine se baaten karte vakt bhi mujhe dar lag rahaa tha or ab, ye tang or andheri seedhiyaan chadhate vakt bhi mujhe dar lag rahaa he
 i do not know what will affect Irene by looking at my slight appearance, and my modest clothes
 magar, ab to chaar-chah seedhiyaan or hai

 And, a woman who looked like a maid half-opened the door, and with her head out, asked whom to search
 meraa naam, dayanand he, miss irine thakur ko milane aayaa he, - kahana khatm bhi nahin kiya tha ki darwaja band ho gaya, naukaraani kii tarah dikhti hui ek aurat kaa cheharaa gaayab ho gaya
 There was a closed door in front, and on the plastic plate on the door was written, Mrs
 Katherine Thakur
 yani, irine kii maan
 i already know that Irene's mother was from France or Belgium or from Czechoslovakia
 irine ke pita ucch vansheey brahman the, or vaayu sena main ucchpdasth afasar the
 Father is no more
 maan bhi nahin hai
 There is only a plastic nameplate
 irine kii maan nahin he, yah sochakar achaanak mujhe bahut dukh hua
 There was a great desire that once i could meet him
 unki ankhon ko, or unke chehre ko or unki baton ko dekhakar sunakar yah samajhane kii koshish karata ki unki aatma main koun-si shakti thi, jo unhen yah saahas de saki ki apana sara kuch tyagkar, khatm karke ve europe se chali ain, hardam ke liye chali ain
 Or, was not Shakti among them, Irene's father? The door then opened, and a girl of twenty-four and twenty-five said to me, "come in
" ""andar aa jaaie" choubees-pachchis kii ek ladki ne mujhase kaha, or muskaraai
 There was no newness in this grin, neither was there aristocracy
 vahi tha, jo bade hotalon yaa bade daftaron ke resepshanist kii muskaraahaton main hota he
 This smile seems familiar to me
 lagata he ki is vyakti se pehle bhi mulaakaat ho chuki he
 It seems, and we suddenly, feel very relaxed and lightness and freshness
 maine yah sab mahasoos nahin kiya, kyonki, yah muskaraahat khud meraa pesha he
 The girl said while moving away - "you sit, sister is taking bath, she will come in ten minutes
" "dringroom itnaa bada nahin tha
 Right in front of me was a long sofa and three girls were sitting on the couch like Japanese dolls
 bain taraf doosraa sopha padaa tha, jis par do praudh vyakti baithe the
 On the right side was the third sofa, on which a young man was sitting alone
 teen sofe par teen ladkiyaan thim, or bich main ek gol tebul tha
 On the table stood a naked silver girl in an old silver vase, and one of her hands was guarding the thighs, the other hand raised above was a few roses of fresh flowers
 donon praudh vyaktiyon ne ek saath kaha- "club kaa vakt ho rahaa he, ham log ab chalem
 "the three girls, looking like Japanese dolls, smiled, and stood up
 akele baithe hue yuvak ne mujhase kaha- "baithiye
 Sister must be coming now
 aapke liye wet kar rahi thim
 Then went to take bath
 "praudh vyakti meri bagal se guzarate hue, or tikhi nigahon se mujhe dekhte hue, kamare se baahar chale gaye
 Got down the stairs
 kamare main do daravaaje the, jaisaa aksar dringroom main hota he
 All three girls left through the second door
 unke peeche vah yuvak bhi chalaa gaya
 Only, the girl who brought me in, stood near the door
 main ek kursi par baithne laga
 "no, sit comfortably on the couch
 didi turant aa jaaengi
 They were waiting for you, ”she told me, and i sat on the couch and lit a cigarette
 kone ke recotebul par aish trey kii ore badha
 He swiftly lifted the ash tray
 or mere sofe kii baanh par rakhane lagi, yaa tebul par rakhane lagi
 And bumped into me
 meraa chashma ankhon se utarkar farsh par gir gaya
 not broken
 vah joro se chikhi, "sori! aai am veri sori
 "I was afraid of his scream
 phir, bolaa- "nahin, sori hone kii koi baat nahin he
 "I assured, then she smiled again, and sat in the front chair
 baithkar meri taraf dekhne lagi
 i started looking at him
 kaaphi der tak dekhte rahane ke baad maine poocha- "aap irine kii bahan hai?""ji haa! sabase badi irine hai
 Then, there is Lilu, the Lilian, who was sitting on the left side
 phir main hoon
 Then, there is Shilu, who was on the right side
 phir, mini
 We are five sisters
 ek bhai he, subhash, jo abhi bheetar gaya he," usne vistaarpurvak uttar diya
 i asked- "you haven't even mentioned your name
 "tabhi irine aa gai
 Come and come, quote- "its name is Shakuntala
 maan un dinon kalidas ke naatak pard rahi thim
 However, those plays have not had any effect on it
 badi batooni he, or bahanon se jhagada karne ke alaava ise koi kaam hi nahin aata
 "shakuntala started blushing
 irine haath main padi kandhi baalo kii ek lat main rokkar, sofe main dhans gai
 i liked Irene's instantly washed face
 chehre par jaraa bhi mechap nahin tha, phir bhi nahin lag rahaa tha ki uski umr tees ko paar kar chuki he
 The foreigner did not look a little in a sleeveless low-cut blouse and a white Khadi sari
 maine suna tha, irine bees-baaise saal france main rah chuki he
 However, nowhere was France on the face or body, Europe was not
 bal khule the or peeth par qamar se neeche fail rahe the
 The arms were open, and appeared to be made of marble
 shakuntla kamare se baahar chali gai
 i sat quietly
 irine ne baalo ko lapetakar temporari juda baandh liya
 During the tying process, my eyes clung to his arms, and i continued to panic
 aatankit isliye hota rahaa ki irine jane-anjaane apane sharir kaa pradarshan kar rahi thi, or uskaa sharir apane-aap main shaareerik abhijatya kaa sundartam udhaaharan tha or pataa nahin meraa swabhaav aisa kyon he ki main nari sharir se or abhijatya se yon hi aatankit hota rahaa hoon
 "beira, let's get coffee for us guys!" Addressing an invisible force, Irene called out with a sultry juggle
 thik minute bhar ke baad coffee aa gai
 a Nepali boy came up with a tray of coffee
 do khaali pyaale, coffee-pot, doodh kaa pyaalaa, chini kaa pyaalaa, ek badi tashtaree, jisamen aam or kele or santare ke tukade the, phulon vaali nangi ladki ko thodaa khiskaakar trey rakh diya gaya
 Irene smiled
 or, coffee banane lagi
