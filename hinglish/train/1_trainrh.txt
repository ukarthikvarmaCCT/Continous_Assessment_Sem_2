 BJP and Shiv Sena have started campaigning for Lok Sabha elections from Vidarbha in Maharashtra today
 is prachaar sabha ke liye donon party ke bade netaa amravati main shuukravaar ke din ikattha hue
 a conference of BJP and Shiv Sena workers was organized in Amravati to resolve differences between them for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jahaan 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehali baar shivasena or bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ek hi manch se ek duusare kii taareef karte najar aae
 To remove the distance between the workers of both sides and the workers should work hard together in the election campaign, that is why both sides were seen waving words at each other
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne apane bhaashan main paanch saal main centre sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye vikaas kaaryo ko ginaya to vahiin shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha ki pichley 15-20 dinon se jab se gathbandhan hui he
 i could not understand what to talk, how to talk because till now there has been a lot of conflict between the two parties
 gauratlab he ki kuch dinon pehle pangarpur kii sabha main uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki chaukeedaar hi chor he
 In Amravati on Friday, he cited the reason for the sharp criticism of the BJP and the Modi government
 uddhav ne kaha ki pichley saade chaar saal ham donon ne ek duusare kii party kii khub aalochana kii
 Uddhav said that even though both did not have bitterness in their mind, they both raised the sword of words against each other
 ab samay aa gaya he ki myaan se talwaar to nikaal di jaae he or ab man main jo naaraazgi he wo bhi dur kii jaae
 In the election campaign and activist conference, Uddhav said that "whatever the two had said against each other, they had made before the public
 25 saal ke gathbandhan or ab saadhe chaar saal main kabhi sangharsh to kabhi dosti, lekin ek baat acchhee he ki ham donon ne kabhi bhi ek duusare ke bich ho rahe sangharsh ko rajya ke vikaas main rukaawat kaa kaaran nahin banaaya
 "uddhav Thackeray exemplified Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to erase the distance between the workers of the two party and to create an amalgamation and said that we have come together with the aim of protecting Hindutva
 saath main kaam bhi milakar karnaa hoga
 Just by chanting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and shouting slogans in the hands of the saffron flag, there will be no alliance between the two sides
 uddhav thakare ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki saamne tarif or peeth peeche kadavaahat agar chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ko dekhi hoti to unhone ham sabhi ko pahari se dhakel dene kii shiksha di hoti
 Uddhav Thackeray did not even say that if the BJP and Shiv Sena had not formed a coalition, we would have lost in the 2019 elections and asked the workers to guess who would have come to power if they had lost
 bhaajapa evam mukhyamantri par tanj kasate hue 2014 kii baat yaad dilaate hue uddhav ne kaha ki ab sharad pavaar kii madad nahin lenaa, unhen party main nahin lenaa, kyonki koi to ho vipaksh main jinaki ham aalochana kar sake
 Devendra Fadnavis, without naming NCP president Sharad Pawar, said that a party captain first announced that he was going to contest the election
 kuch hi dinon baad phir se vahi captain bole ab 2019 kaa chunaav nahin laduunga
 Fadnavis said that Modi ji always says that Sharad Pawar ji recognizes the attitude of wind
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ashok chouhan ne rajya main chunavi hawa kidar ja rahi he ye jaan liya he
 Their defeat is certain and that is why they have decided not to contest

 neeche dekhen vivaadit video: The Ministry of Education of China has ordered all higher educational institutions to make 'sex and love' courses compulsory from this year
 khaas baat yah he ki aisa lag rahaa he ki sabhi chaatr ise lekar utsahit nahin hai or kuch kaa kahana he ki yah bahut neeras he
 The psychological curriculum will be made compulsory for university students from September including 'sex and love'
 mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne sarkari ‘china daily’ se kaha ki mantralay ne is saal june main deshbhar ke vishvavidhyalayon ke sabhi vidhaon ke chaatro ke liye ek anivaary maansik swasthya paathyakram taiyaar karne ke liye kaha
 He said, 'actually such college courses have been ready for many years but they are mainly elective courses
 ’ adhikari ne kaha ki paathyakramon ko anivaary banane kaa mantralay ne faisla isliye kiya he kyonki zyaadaatar vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro ko baari dabaav kii vajah se manovaigyanik dishanirdesh kii madad lene kii salaah di gai he
 He said that there will be seven parts of the new compulsory course
 sex or prem ke alaava is paathyakram main anya manovaigyanik samasyaon se nibatane ko lekar bhi adhyayan suchi he jisamen jivan or padhai main dabaav or ulajhanon se nibatna shaamil he
 However, there has been mixed response to this move of the ministry
 peking vishvavidhyalay main chikitsa vigyaan kii 18 varshiya chaatra gaavo chang ne kaha ki is tarah ke paathyakram naye chaatro ke bich kaaphi lokapriy hai
 He said, 'psychological courses in our school with little knowledge of sex and childbirth are popular but they are still optional
 ’ kuch chaatro kaa haalanki kahana he ki ise anivaary banane kii koi vajah nahin he
 Peking University student Wang Kefai, who took a psychological course in the first year, said it was very boring and it did not benefit him
 is chaatra ke purush mitra hi phang ne kaha, ‘sabhi chaatro ko is tarah kii shiksha kii jarurat nahin he
 Anyway we are university students and most of us know about sex and love

 Everyone wants to buy gold in the festive season, but this time your desire may be a bit expensive
 darasal, har din gold kii keemat ek nayaa record bana rahi he
 Presently, gold is priced at Rs 38 thousand 450 per 10 grams in the Indian bullion market
 lekin bazaar ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki aane vaale dinon main yah bhav 40 hajaar rupee prati das gram ke str ko paar kar saktaa he
 If we talk only about 2019, then the price of gold has seen a rise of more than 20 percent
 12 din main gold kii keemtabeete 12 din ke gold kii keemat kii baat karen to 2750 rupee se adhik kii teji ai he
 Gold was at Rs 35 thousand 710 per 10 grams on 1 August
 iske 12 din baad somvaar ko yah 38 hajaar 470 rupee ke str par pahunch gaya
 But the question is why there is such a huge rise in the price of gold
 aaie jaanate hai iskaa jawaab
 
 1
 The biggest reason for the rise in the price of gold is the global political crisis
 darasal, vaishvik str par america or china ke bich trade war gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Recently, the US has imposed import duty on Chinese goods
 america ke mutabik china apni karency yuan ke saath chhedchhad kar rahaa he
 This is the reason why the US has called China's yuan a 'currency manipulator'
 yahi nahin, america raashtrapati donald trump ne china se vaarta khatm karne ke bhi sanket die hai
 After these decisions, the world is now waiting for China's response
 donon deshon ke bich ban rahe in halaaton main niveshak surakshit nivesh ke liye gold ke vikalp ko apana rahe hai
 Prices are rising due to the demand for gold
 2
 In addition, gold purchases are being continued by most central banks around the world due to concerns over the global economy
 bazaar ke jaankaron kii maane to yah silsilaa aage bhi jari rahane kii ashanka he
 Let us know that recently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has indicated a slowdown in the global economy
 3
 The Government of India has increased the import duty on gold by two and a half percent while presenting the general budget in the month of July
 iske baad gold par duty 12
 5 percent
 emport duty badhane se gold kaa kaarobaar teji se gata he
 Explain that India is a big importer of gold
 yah apni jarurat kaa zyada hissaa aayaat karata he
 4
 beete kuch hafte main alag-alag kaarnon se bhartiya share bazaar kii chaal sust najar ai
 According to market experts, because of this slack, investors are emphasizing on investing in gold by selling shares
 bataa den ki aam bajet main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne videshi nivesh par sarcharge lagane kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then the stock market has seen a tremendous decline
 5
 If a country's central bank cuts the rate, then the price of gold rises
 bhartiya rigerv bank beete 8 maheene main ab tak chaar baar rate cat kar chukaa he
 In such a situation, the prices of gold have also increased
 iske alaava america fed ke byaaj daron main katautee bhi gold main teji kii vajah bani he

 The country's debt was 69% of GDP in FY19
 jabaki 2018 main ye 68

 According to the data, from 2013 to 2017, the government's debt was 341 per cent of its income but in 2018 it showed a slight decline and it was 329
 1 fisadi rah gaya
 This decline occurred because inflation was controlled a bit

 It is also necessary to mention here that in many developed economies, debt and GDP ratio is much higher than in India

 kareeb bees saalon ke baad punjab main hue aatanki hamale ne sabaki kalai kholkar rakh di
 If the terrorists were successful in their nefarious designs, then the number of those who died would have been much more
 is hamale main kul nau logon kii maut hui he
 Only three terrorists entered the border and it took more than 11 hours to kill them
 wo bhi tab jab muthbhed khaali ghar main chal rahi thi
 When the encounter was prolonged, it was argued that the police wanted to capture the terrorists alive, but the entire Punjab was shaken by this terrible attack
 dahalanaa swabhaavik bhi tha kyonki punjab aatankwaad ke un bhayanak dinon ko lagbhag bhula chukaa tha jisamen hajaaron log maut ke ghat utaar diye gayi the
 More surprisingly, the country's home minister not only praised the Punjab Police for this operation but also congratulated it
 tark ye diya gaya ki duniyabar main ye massej dena chahie ki ham aatankwaad ko mudde par ek hai
 Nobody thought it necessary to review this action
 vaise ye hamalaa na to pehla tha or na hi aakhri
 But how to deal with it? Will we deal with terrorists like this? It is not a battle of clutches that one should decide face to face
 agar kisi ne aatankiyon se muthbhed ke vakt kaa video dekha ho to iskaa andaja ho jaayegaa
 Leaving only the SWAT commandos of the police, hardly anyone was fit to fight the terrorists, neither physically, nor mentally, nor with weapons
 punjab police ke kuch jawan to aatankiyon ko lalkaar rahe the ki saamne aakar lado
 While he himself was neither wearing a bullet proof jacket nor a better coverup
 aatanki jis building main chhipakar firing kar kar rahe the wo khaali thi or usamen jo jawan the use aatankiyon ne maar diya tha
 One terrorist was killed initially and the other was killed while removing the grenade pin
 bas ek aatanki wo bhi ghayal phir use maarane main kai ghante lag gaye
 The Punjab Police DGP says about why the Punjab Police soldiers were not fighting the terrorists wearing bullet proof jackets, 150 jackets were seen in the car but they are Punjab Police personnel
 ab aap khud hi sochie ye unki naadaani he, bevakoofi he yaa phir gaiyr peshewar ravaiya
 The enemy standing in front of you is firing from the AK-47 and only three not three rifles are showing bravery with no bullet proof jacket
 pataa nahin ab jabaki oparation khatm ho gaya he to ye maanane main kya buraai he ki punjab police ke paas us vakt vaise hathiyaar nahin the jisase wo aatanki se muqabla kar pate
 That is why this encounter took so long
 haalanki hamalaa hone ke kuch der baad sena ke special force ke jawan pahunch gayi the lekin punjab police ne inkaa istemaal nahin kiya
 If you go back a little, when there was a terrorist attack in Mumbai too, then neither did they have such trained soldiers nor weapons who could compete with the terrorists
 punjab bhi isse achoota thodi he
 It may be possible after this terrorist attack and pay attention to the training and weapons of the soldiers, so that they can counter the terror in every way
 vaise philhal is par sirf andaaj hi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon kaa makasad kya tha
 But one thing definitely came out of these estimates that even the border restrictions are not able to stop the infiltration of terrorists
 yun to pakistan se lage international border par parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa kaa daawa lagaataar biguef karti rahi he par nadi naalon ke raaston se aane vaale aatanki in daavon kii samay samay par dhajjiyaan jarur uda rahe hai
 There is no fencing everywhere, especially where there are rivers and streams
 kehane ko artiphisial abstekal (kritrim baadhaaen) jarur hai par wo zyada kargaar nahin hai
 In the investigation of terrorist attacks on police posts, vehicles and military bases on jammu-pathankot highway, one thing came out that all the attackers had taken advantage of our security flaws and entered this side
 jammu kii tarah yahaan pehle biguef ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi ki international border se hokar aatanki ghuse
 Later, when the GPS was revealed, he agreed that the terrorists had come to Punjab via IB
 tippaniyan Keep in mind that the terrorists were unfortunate and the people of Gurdaspur were unfortunate that the evil intentions of the terrorists could not succeed, otherwise the loss would have been much more
 ye khatra tala to iskaa credit bas driver nanakchand or kisaan satpal ko jaataa he
 Nanakchand did not stop the bus after the terrorists stopped the bus and drove away
 us halaat main jabaki us par fire hua, baavjood iske wo daraa nahin or naa hi ghabaraaya, jisase bas main baithe 76 logon kii jaan batch gai
 Similarly, Satpal saw a bomb on the railway track and then somehow the train was stopped so that hundreds of people sitting in 9 crowded boxes were not even scratched
 khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Punjab may prove to be a weak target for the forces launching attacks in Punjab
 punjab main aatankwaad ke phir badhate kadamon ko rokna vahaan kii sarkaar ke haath main he
 For this, all political parties will have to rise above party politics and give a befitting reply to the nefarious strategy of the enemy or else the path of terrorism which has been turning from twenty years ago to the path of development is again two decades ago
 i will go and stand up
 muthbhed zyada der tak khinch jane par tark diya gaya ki police aatankiyon ko jinda pakadana chaahati thi lekin itane hi puraa punjab is bhayanak hamale se dahal uthaa
 Shocking was also natural as Punjab had almost forgotten the terrible days of terrorism in which thousands of people were killed
 tajjub tab or zyada hua jab desh ke grih mantri ne is oparation par na keval punjab police kii saraahna kii balki badhai bhi di
 The argument has been given that this message should be given worldwide that we are one on the issue of terrorism
 kisi ne bhi is karrwai kii samiksha karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 However, this attack was neither the first nor the last
 par isse kaise nipta gaya? kya aatankiyon se aise niptenge? ye koi guttham guttha kii ladaai to he nahin ki aamane saamne aakar faisla kar liya jaae
 If anyone has seen the video of the time of the encounter with the terrorists, then it will be known
 keval police ke SWAT commando ko chhod diya jaae to shaayad hi koi aatankiyon se ladane ke liye feet tha, na to shaareerik taur par, na hi maansik or na hi hathiyaar se
 Some Punjab Police jawans were daring the terrorists to come forward and fight
 jabaki wo khud na to bullate pruf jacket pahane the or na hi behatar tareeke se kavaap the
 The building in which the terrorists were hiding and firing was empty and the young men who were in it were killed by the terrorists
 ek aatanki ko shuru main hi maar diya gaya or doosraa grenade ke pin nikaalte vakt khud maaraa gaya
 Just one terrorist, he was injured and it took several hours to kill him
 punjab police ke jawan bullate pruf jacket pahanakar kyon nahin aatankiyon se lard rahe the, is bare main punjab police ke dijipi kehete hai 150 jacket gaadi main jaakhe the lekin ye punjab police ke jawan hai
 Now think for yourself whether it is their ignorance, stupid or non-professional attitude
 aapke saamne khadaa dushman eke-47 se fire kar kar rahaa he or keval thri note thri rifl, bina bullate pruf jacket ke sahare bahaduree dikhaa rahe hai
 Do not know now that the operation is over, then what is the harm in assuming that the Punjab Police did not have the weapons at that time that they would be able to compete with the terrorist
 yahi vajah rahi ki ye muthbhed itani lambii khinchi
 Although the Special Army personnel reached the army shortly after the attack, they were not used by the Punjab Police
 agar thodaa peeche jaaen to jab mumbai main bhi aatanki hamalaa hua tha to unke paas bhi na to aise prashikshit jawan the or na hi hathiyaar jo aatankiyon se muqabla kar pate
 Punjab is also a little untouched by this
 ho saktaa he is aatanki hamale ke baad sanbhal jaae or javaanon kii training or hathiyaar par dhyaan de, taaki wo phir har tarah se aatank kaa muqabla kar saken
 At the moment, it is only being speculated on what was the motive of the terrorists
 par ek baat jarur in andaajon se nikal kar aati thi ki seemaa par kii jane vaali tarbandi bhi aatankiyon kii ghuspaith ko roak nahin paa rahi he
 Though the BSF has been claiming that Parinda cannot be killed on the international border along Pakistan, but the terrorists coming from the river drains are blowing these claims from time to time
 har jagah baad nahin lagi hui he, khaskar jahaan par nadi or naale hai
 There are artificial artifacts to say, but they are not very effective
 jammu-pathankot rajmarg par police chaukiyon, vaahanon or sainik thikaanon par hue aatanki hamalon kii jaanch main ek hi baat saamne ai ki sabhi hamalavar hamaari suraksha kii khaamiyon kaa laabh uthaakar is ore ghuse the
 Like Jammu, the first BSF here was not ready to believe that terrorists entered through the international border
 baad main jab jeepies se khulaasa hua tab jaakar wo maane ki aatanki ibi se hokar punjab main aaye the
 The comments dhyaan rahe aatankiyon kii badakismati thi or gurdaspur ke log khudakismat rahen ki aatankiyon ke napak mansoobey kaamyaab nahin ho sake varanaa nuksaan isse kahin zyada hota
 If this danger is averted, its credit goes to the bus driver Nanakchand and the farmer Satpal
 nanakchand ne aatankiyon ke bas rukvane par bas nahin roki or bhaga le gaya
 In that situation, when he was fired on, despite this he did not get scared nor panicked, which saved the lives of 76 people sitting in the bus
 aise hi satpal ne railway trek par bam dekha or phir kisi tarah train rukvaai gai jisase 9 bheed bhaad bhare dabbe main baithe saikadon logon ko kharonch tak nahin ai
 The danger is not yet over
 punjab main hamalon kii shuruuaat karne vaali takaton ke liye punjab ek kamjor lakshya (soft target) sabit ho saktaa he
 In Punjab, the government of the government is there to stop the increasing steps of terrorism
 iske liye vahaan ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko bhi dalgat raajnneeti se upar uth kar dushman kii napak ranneeti kaa munhtod uttar dena hoga varanaa punjab bees saal pehle aatankwaad ke jis raste se mud kar vikaas ke raste par chalaa rahaa he vah phir do dashak pehle ke daur main jaakar khadaa ho jayega

 haalanki hamalaa hone ke kuch der baad sena ke special force ke jawan pahunch gayi the lekin punjab police ne inkaa istemaal nahin kiya
 If you go back a little, when there was a terrorist attack in Mumbai too, then neither did they have such trained soldiers nor weapons who could compete with the terrorists
 punjab bhi isse achoota thodi he
 It may be possible after this terrorist attack and pay attention to the training and weapons of the soldiers, so that they can counter the terror in every way
 vaise philhal is par sirf andaaj hi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon kaa makasad kya tha
 But one thing definitely came out of these estimates that even the border restrictions are not able to stop the infiltration of terrorists
 yun to pakistan se lage international border par parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa kaa daawa lagaataar biguef karti rahi he par nadi naalon ke raaston se aane vaale aatanki in daavon kii samay samay par dhajjiyaan jarur uda rahe hai
 There is no fencing everywhere, especially where there are rivers and streams
 kehane ko artiphisial abstekal (kritrim baadhaaen) jarur hai par wo zyada kargaar nahin hai
 In the investigation of terrorist attacks on police posts, vehicles and military bases on jammu-pathankot highway, one thing came out that all the attackers had taken advantage of our security flaws and entered this side
 jammu kii tarah yahaan pehle biguef ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi ki international border se hokar aatanki ghuse
 Later, when the GPS was revealed, he agreed that the terrorists had come to Punjab via IB
 tippaniyan Keep in mind that the terrorists were unfortunate and the people of Gurdaspur were unfortunate that the evil intentions of the terrorists could not succeed, otherwise the loss would have been much more
 ye khatra tala to iskaa credit bas driver nanakchand or kisaan satpal ko jaataa he
 Nanakchand did not stop the bus after the terrorists stopped the bus and drove away
 us halaat main jabaki us par fire hua, baavjood iske wo daraa nahin or naa hi ghabaraaya, jisase bas main baithe 76 logon kii jaan batch gai
 Similarly, Satpal saw a bomb on the railway track and then somehow the train was stopped so that hundreds of people sitting in 9 crowded boxes were not even scratched
 khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Punjab may prove to be a weak target for the forces launching attacks in Punjab
 punjab main aatankwaad ke phir badhate kadamon ko rokna vahaan kii sarkaar ke haath main he
 For this, all political parties will have to rise above party politics and give a befitting reply to the nefarious strategy of the enemy or else the path of terrorism which has been turning from twenty years ago to the path of development is again two decades ago
 i will go and stand up

 jammu-pathankot rajmarg par police chaukiyon, vaahanon or sainik thikaanon par hue aatanki hamalon kii jaanch main ek hi baat saamne ai ki sabhi hamalavar hamaari suraksha kii khaamiyon kaa laabh uthaakar is ore ghuse the
 Like Jammu, the first BSF here was not ready to believe that terrorists entered through the international border
 baad main jab jeepies se khulaasa hua tab jaakar wo maane ki aatanki ibi se hokar punjab main aaye the
 The comments dhyaan rahe aatankiyon kii badakismati thi or gurdaspur ke log khudakismat rahen ki aatankiyon ke napak mansoobey kaamyaab nahin ho sake varanaa nuksaan isse kahin zyada hota
 If this danger is averted, its credit goes to the bus driver Nanakchand and the farmer Satpal
 nanakchand ne aatankiyon ke bas rukvane par bas nahin roki or bhaga le gaya
 In that situation, when he was fired on, despite this he did not get scared nor panicked, which saved the lives of 76 people sitting in the bus
 aise hi satpal ne railway trek par bam dekha or phir kisi tarah train rukvaai gai jisase 9 bheed bhaad bhare dabbe main baithe saikadon logon ko kharonch tak nahin ai
 The danger is not yet over
 punjab main hamalon kii shuruuaat karne vaali takaton ke liye punjab ek kamjor lakshya (soft target) sabit ho saktaa he
 In Punjab, the government of the government is there to stop the increasing steps of terrorism
 iske liye vahaan ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko bhi dalgat raajnneeti se upar uth kar dushman kii napak ranneeti kaa munhtod uttar dena hoga varanaa punjab bees saal pehle aatankwaad ke jis raste se mud kar vikaas ke raste par chalaa rahaa he vah phir do dashak pehle ke daur main jaakar khadaa ho jayega

 loksabhaa chunaav ke 6 charan kaa matdaan ho chukaa he
 On May 19, the seventh and last phase of votes will be cast
 23 may ko maaloom chal jayega ki pradhanmantri kii kursi par narendra modi kabiz rahenge yaa koi nayaa bagdor sanbhaalega
 Election campaign is in full swing
 narendra modi se lekar rahul gandhi, mamata banerjee se lekar mayawati or akhilesh se lekar priyanka gandhi, koi netaa thodi bhi kasar nahin chhodana chahta
 While on the one hand, in the speeches, PM Modi is again talking of getting the NDA majority, on the other hand Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee and Priyanka Gandhi have increased the tension by opening a front against him
 mamata or modi ke bich tu-tu main-main kis str par pahunch gai he, yah kisi se chipa nahin he
 Mayawati dragged Jashodaben and launched the biggest attack on PM Narendra Modi so far
 mayawati ne kaha ki modi ne raajnneetik swaarth ke kaaran apni patni ko chhod diya
 He said that married women in BJP are afraid of Modi
 vahiin priyanka gandhi uttar pradesh main bijepi or modi factor ko kamjor karne main juty hai
 On Monday, Priyanka Gandhi appeared at the Mahakaleshwar temple in Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh and then at PM Ratlam rally, showering questions on PM Modi
 agar yun kahen ki anya vipakshi netaaon se itar modi kii in teen mardaaniyon se alag ladaai chal rahi he to galat nahin hoga
 In Uttar Pradesh, the challenge before the BJP was to fight the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party
 lekin priyanka gandhi ne achaanak entry markar sirdardi or badha di
 Mamta Banerjee continues to attack PM Modi every day
 mamata ko lagata he ki piem modi bengal or unki chhavi kharaab kar rahe hai
 Actually, the comments of Mamta and Modi government had increased even before the elections started
 bijepi ko bengal se kaaphi ummid he
 That is why both Modi and Amit Shah are repeatedly challenging Mamata in her stronghold
 iske alaava upi kii kii raajnneeti main alag jagah rakhane vaali mayawati bhi lagbhag har raily main piem modi kii nitiyon par kataaksh kar rahi hai
 Mayawati may not have allowed the entry of Congress in the SP-BSP alliance, but with such statements she is fully supporting the Congress backdoor
 piem modi ne chunaav prachaar main mayawati ke prati sahanubhuti dikhaate hue kaha tha ki akhilesh or congress unhen dhokhaa de rahe hai
 But Mayawati will be provoked so much by trying to burglar this idea, she may not have lived
 ab baat priyanka gandhi kii, jo bhai rahul gandhi kii tarah soft hindutv kaa sahaara le rahi hai
 From Jhansi to Siddheshwar temple to Kashi Vishwanath temple, she has also visited and prayed
 ujjain mahakaal mandir main puja ke baad unhone ratlam main kaha ki piem modi khud ko sanyasi kehete hai to garib kisaanon or berozegaron kii sud kyon nahin lete
 For 40 minutes she stayed in the Mahakal temple and was completely absorbed in Shiva bhakti
 apane bhaashanon main vah notebandi, jiesti, berogari or kisaanon ko lekar narendra modi par tanj kasati rahati hai
 Now it will have to be seen whether Narendra Modi has an upper hand on May 23, or these three men will win

 But Bhansali said that no he will do this film, this is his best part
 haalanki deepika ne saath hi ye bhi kaha ki wo koi bhi khatra lene ko taiyaar thim

 CM yogi-keshav prasad maury ke bich varchasv kii jangek duusare ke khilaaf khel rahe hai shah-maat kaa khel2017 main satta main vaapasi ke saath hi chhid gai thi janguttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or unke dipti keshav prasad maury ke bich sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Looking at the recent developments, the two peaks of the top leadership of the UP government are seen rolling up sleeves against each other
 yun to yogi or maury ke bich manmutav kii khabaren inke satta sanbhaalane ke baad se hi satta ke galiyaaron or media main aa rahi thim lekin ab maamla thodaa gambhir ho gaya he
 The situation has become such that whether Yogi or Maurya are both bent on proving themselves to be twenty by showing proactively at each other's subordinate departments
 gauratlab he ki 2019 main siem yogi adityanath ne keshav prasad maury ke peedblyoody vibhaag dwaara pichley 2 saal main karaae gaye tender or bade nirmaan kaaryo kii jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya
 These contracts and construction work are worth about two thousand crore rupees
 siem yogi ko andeh he ki peedblyoody vibhaag main thekon or nirmaan kaaryon main jamkar dhaandhlee hui he
 The message was that through this Yogi wants to keep tight on Keshav Prasad Maurya
 CM ke adheen vibhaag ke afasaron par aaropayogi adityanath ke aadesh ke baad naaraaz keshav maury ne mukhyamantri ko unke netritv vaale vibhaag ld main faile bhrashtachar or rishwatakhori ke bare main ek chitthee likh daali
 Keshav Maurya, in his letter, accused many LDA officials that they were involved in corruption and should be investigated
 dilachasp baat yah he ki keshav maury kii 'gopneey' chitthee media main li ho gai
 This made public the talk of corruption in the LDA under the Chief Minister
 ise yogi ke ection kaa maury kii ore se jawaab mana gaya
 Yogi took the class of officers of the department under Maurya
 In October, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a review meeting of Road Maintenance Unit of PWD
 isamen keshav prasad maury shaamil nahin hue
 In this meeting, Yogi Adityanath put a class of officers in Uttar Pradesh regarding the poor condition of roads and their maintenance and fixed the date of filling the pit of the road by 15th November
 aadhikarik sutron ke mutabik yogi adityanath is meeting main itane naaraaz hue ki unhone pramukh sachiv peedblyoody ko un logon ke khilaaf exiaar darj karaane ke bhi aadesh die jo ki jilon main fund hone ke baavjood sadakon kii marammat or nirmaan kaa kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 At the same meeting, Yogi Adityanath also ordered an inquiry into all the 2-year work of PWD, Urban Development and Irrigation Department
 jawaab main keshav ne phoda 'chitthee bam'yogi ke is kadam ke baad 13 november ko keshav prasad maury ne yogi adityanath ko ld vibhaag main faile bhrashtachar ke bare main chitthee likhi or jaanch karaane kii maang kii
 It mainly mentioned the construction of apartments and all the cases of corruption
 jisamen saaf taur par keshav maury ne aarope lagaaya tha ki privet bilderon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye ld ne niyamon ko taak par rakh diya he
 In his letter, Keshav Maurya questioned the construction of Parijat, Panchsheel, Smriti, Srishti and Sahaj Apartments, asking why these people were not blacklisted
 sirf 9 din puraani companiyon ko construction kaa kaam alot kar diya gaya he
 Keshav Maurya also put the cutting of regional newspapers in his letter to confirm his claim
 chitthee par machaa tha bavaal, hua actionkeshav maury ke chitthee likhane ke baad yogi sarkaar ne jaanch karke lakhanu vikaas praadhikaran main registerd 11 contractor form ko blike list kar diya or kai logon ke khilaaf karrwai ke bhi nirdesh die, lekin siem or dipti siem ke bich kaa cold war kaa nayaa chapter isse khul gaya
 Sources reveal that some special officers have been deployed to monitor Keshav Maurya's PWD department
 saath hi un adhikariyon ko vibhaag se hataaya gaya he, jinke upar keshav maury bharosa karte the
 The latest case is of investigation against Ramesh Kumar Barnwal
 peedblyoody ke vibhaagadhyaksh aarasi baranwaal sahit teen ejiniyaron ke khilaaf iodblyoo, pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana (pimgsavai) ke tahat bani sadakon main hui dhaandhlee kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has submitted this inquiry to the Economic Offenses Branch (EOW)
 baranwaal ko haal hi main pramukh abhiyantaa (vikaas) evam vibhaagadhyaksh kaa atirikt prabhaar diya gaya tha
 Whereas, earlier, Barnwal was also given the responsibility of investigating many cases of construction work
 sutron bataate hai ki baranwaal kii jagah siem yogi adityanath apane vishwasaneey peedbludi ke adhikari aaraar singh ko baithaana chaahate the
 Whereas, Barnaval is close to Kesha, that is why Keshav has publicly sided with the honesty of Barnwal
 vipaksh bana rahaa mudda, centre saadhe he mauncongress ke netaa akhilesh pratap singh is vivaad kii vajah sarkaar main sheersh str par faile bhrishtachar ko maanate hai
 They say that both are blaming each other's departments, but none is being taken
 is maamle kii maujuuda jaj se jaanch karai jane kii maang karte hue akhilesh pratap singh kehete hai ki isamen rajyapal ko dakhlandaji kerani chahie or donon logon ke khilaaf jaanch kerani chahie
 There is also information about the ruckus between the two top leaders of Uttar Pradesh and the big people sitting in the center and the organization
 sutara bataate hai ki mukhyamantri ne keshav maury ko lekar sanghathan ke bade logon se baat bhi kii he or haal ke dinon main hue tamaam maamalon kii jaankaree bhi di he
 On the other hand, Keshav Maurya has also talked to his trusted people of the organization about this
 donon netaaon kii apni-apni lobbying he
 The 'jung', which was crowned by the coronation, actually started the battle of supremacy between Yogi Adityanath and Keshav Prasad Maurya during the coronation in 2017
 inke bich vivaad kii shuruyaat tabhi se ho gai thi, jab saal 2017 main bijepi upi main keshav prasad maury ke adhyaksh main prachand jeet ke saath main vaapasi kii thi or baad main yogi adityanath ko mukhyamantri bana diya gaya tha
 Keshav Prasad Maurya being the president and the bjp's overwhelming victory in Uttar Pradesh, considered himself the most powerful contender for the Chief Minister, but Yogi Adityanath won the contest on one occasion
 aise main keshav prasad maury kii naaraazgi ke baavjood mukhyamantri kaa sehara yogi adityanath ke sir par sajaa tha
 At that time, Keshav Prasad Maurya had also protested, but the top organization somehow managed to calm him down and was awarded the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 upi main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke chand dinon baad hi ek ke baad ek yogi adityanath or up mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ke bich kii takaraar saamne aati rahi hai
 The battle for supremacy between Yogi and Keshav was cleared in January 2018, when all the senior leaders were to attend the first UP Day to be celebrated on January 24
 keshav prasad maury usamen shaamil nahin hue
 Sources reveal that Keshav Prasad Maurya was upset that his photo was not printed on all the boards and flexes of UP Day
 haalanki baad main naa shaamil hone ke peeche netaaon dwaara kaaran yah bataaya gaya ki us din unka mumbai main pehle se kaarykram tha or jab keshav maury program main upi main shaamil hi nahin ho rahe the to unki photo chhapane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 However, no one had a proper answer to why Maurya went to another state, leaving behind a big program in the state
 lambey samay se chal rahaa sangharshaviram tutaa dikh rahisake baad saal 2018 ke main kai aise maukey aae jisamen keshav prasad maury bade kaaryakramon se nadaarad rahe
 On January 20, Keshav Maurya was not invited for the Youth Opening program in Varanasi, then Keshav Maurya did not reach the meeting of ministers on 23 January
 iske baad soobe main lagaataar ho rahi in ghatnaon kii bhanak dilli main lagi to dhire-dhire baat aghoshit tareeke se is baat par santulit kii gai ki up mukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ke vibhaag main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa zyada hastkshep nahin rahegaa
 After this, everything was going normal between the two leaders, but suddenly in July of this year, Yogi Adityanath took on the PWD department headed by Keshav Prasad Maurya
 isi ke baad keshav maury ne palatwaar kiya, jiske baad yah baat saarvajanik hone lagi ki donon sheersh netaaon ke bich varchasv kii jang ab bhi jari he

 Mr
 Perfectionist Aamir Khan's film Dangal not only created many records at the box office but also gave a new definition to Woman Wrestling
 'dangal'ne sabit kar diya ki bina mechap or bina fancy lokations ke bhi ek strong messej vaali damdaar kahani jhande gaad sakati he
 But apart from receiving praise, the film also got stuck in many contrasts
 sabase pehle togita phogatake real life coach ne film par ek legal cese thoka or aarope lagaaya ki bevajaah film main unki bejjati dikhaai gai he, jabaki asal main aisa nahin he or phogot parivaar ke saath unke sambandh bahut achche hai
 After that a new controversy has emerged today when a lawyer named Adil Khatri accused the filmmakers of insulting the national anthem of India
 'jai ho foundation' naam kii ek enjio kii sahaayta se adil khatri ne 'dangal' ke nirmaataaon par kanoonee kaarywahi kii maang kii he
 After the victory of Geeta Phogat at the end of the film, the national anthem of India begins in a very slow tone
 'jai ho foundation' kaa maananaa he ki yah supreme court kii guidelins ke anukool nahin tha
 For this reason Adil Khatri, trustee and legal head of 'jai Ho Foundation', has written a letter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) demanding that legal action should be taken on it
 adil naa sirf is baat se naaraaz hai ki rashtrgan kaa swar bahut dhimaa tha balki unka kahana he ki is seen ke dauraan film nirmaataaon ko ek disclemur bhi daalana chahie tha ki audiyans apni apni seat se uthakar raashtragan kaa sammaan karen

 madhya pradesh congress main chal rahe ghamaasan se sonia gandhi narajasonia ne maamle main madhya pradesh congress prabharee se maangi reportmadhya pradesh congress main andarkhaane chal rahaa ghamaasan ab alaakaman tak pahunch gaya he
 The interim president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, sought a report on the ongoing dispute between Congress leader Digvijay Singh and the state's forest minister Umang Singhar
 unhone yah report madhya pradesh congress prabharee deepak baavariyaa se maangi he
 According to sources, Madhya Pradesh Congress in-charge Deepak Bavaria has submitted his report to Sonia Gandhi
 isamen unhone kaha ki digvijay singh ne mantriyon se unke dwaara kiye gaye kaamon kaa jawaab maanga he
 Some ministers are uncomfortable with this
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki umang singhar ke bayaan se sonia gandhi behad naaraaz hai
 Deepak Bavaria said in his report that Umang Singhar's statements have damaged the party's image
 unke digvijay singh ko lekar die gaye kuch bayaan aapattijanak hai, jisase bachaa ja saktaa tha
 If any leader makes a statement then it will be acted upon
 darasal, madhya pradesh ke vanmantri umang singhar ne purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ko blackmailer bataaya tha
 Simultaneously, Digvijay Singh was accused of running the government from behind the scenes
 iske baad digvijay singh media ke saamne aae the or safai di thi
 He dismissed Umang Singhar's allegations and said that action should be taken against the party leaders who were indiscipline
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki party main anushaasanheenata katai bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia also jumped into this controversy
 buudhvaar ko unhone gwalior main media se baatcheet kii or vanmantri umang singhar kaa samarthan kiya
 He said that the state government should go on its own
 isamen kisi kaa bhi hastkshep nahin hona chahie
 Scindia said that the issues raised by Umang Singhar should be heard well
 mujhe lagata he ki soobe ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ko is maamle par donon pakshon ko baitaakar vivaad kaa samaadhaan jald nikaalnaa chahie, kyonki 15 saal kii kadi mehnat ke baad madhya pradesh main congress kii sarkaar bani he
 He said that it has not been even 6 months since the Kamal Nath government came to power and a dispute has started in the Congress party
 sindhiya ne kaha ki congress sarkaar se logon ko vikaas ko lekar ummide hai
 If any dispute of any kind comes up, Chief Minister Kamal Nath should settle the dispute by sitting on both sides
 kaha jaataa he ki centre kii satta kii raah uttar pradesh se hi guzarati he
 But the path for bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is passing through Varanasi
 yah shahar uttar pradesh or bihar ke sabhi 120 sansadeey kshetron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 The upper castes like Brahmins, Rajputs and Bhumihars constitute about 20 percent of the population
 modi ke paksh main oonchi jatiyon kii golbandi ho sakati he
 The same thing is going to be important for BJP in Hindi heartland
 india today group-sisero ke vishesh varanasi janamat surveykshan se jaahir hota he ki vahaan 12 may ko kya rujhaan rahegaa
 It also analyzes the mood of the people there, so that the picture of the most awaited election battle of 2014 is going to be clear
 modi ko aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaa arvind kejariwal kii chunauti ne is ladaai ko or dilachasp bana diya he
 According to the survey, Kejriwal's magic could not work in Varanasi due to the destruction of Sheila Dixit in Delhi
 modi bahusankhyak voton ke saath badhat banaae hue hai or unke virdohi 50 fisadi se kam vot main hi bantwaaraa karne tak simit hai
 Ajay Rai of Congress has emerged second, while Kailashnath Chaurasia of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Vijay Prakash Jaiswal of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are expected to get less than 10 percent of the votes
 modi 56 fisadi voton ke saath sabhi virgon ke votaron main badhat banaae hue hai
 Most of the Varanasi seat is urban
 shahari ilaakon main modi ko baari badhat (61 fisadi) hasil he jo gramin ilaakon se kaaphi zyada he
 According to the survey, the voters of the higher income group are going to vote for BJP in a big way (60 per cent), which is more than the lower income group (55 per cent)
 yahi rujhaan vibhinn shaikshik varg ke matadaataaon ke maamle main bhi he
 The ethnic arithmetic of Varanasi also fits the overall trend of the state, which emerged in the India Today group-cicero opinion poll in the last week of March and first week of April this year
 varanasi main kareeb ek-chauthai oonchi jatiyon ke voter ekamusth bijepi ko vot dene ja rahe hai
 The share of the remaining parties in upper caste voters has been reduced to just one point
 sirf ajay raay hi 17 fisadi bhoomihaar vot ke saath apwaad hai
 Rai, an MLA from Pindra area of varanasi district, is a popular Bhumihar leader
 lekin apni jati main unki apil oonchi jatiyon main modi kii hawa par fark nahin daal paa rahi he
 BJP seems to get 67 percent Bhumihar votes
 vahiin yadav bijepi (41 fisadi) or sapa (40 fisadi) main bante dikh rahe hai jabaki duusari obisi jatiyon kaa jhukaav bijepi kii ore he
 Even among the bsp's traditional voter Jatavs, about one-third are seen going towards BJP
 vaise bispi 44 fisadi ke saath inamen badhat banaae hue he lekin pichley 15 saal main party ko vot dene vaale jatvon kii yah sabase kam taadaad hogi
 About 20 percent of the total votes of Varanasi's Muslim vote are being distributed among various parties
 paaramparik nazariye main ve bijepi ke khilaaf sabase tagade pratyaashee ko ekamusth vot dete hai
 This logic is only visible to some extent here
 kareeb 40 fisadi muslim congress ko vot de sakate hai jabaki 'aap’ ko 20 fisadi
 The surprise is that 17 percent of the Muslim vote is going to the BJP
 india today group-sisero ke uttar pradesh surveykshan main sanket mil chukaa he ki is baar pradesh main musalamaanon kaa ek chota varg bijepi ko vot karegaa
 If this happens, there will be a question mark on the notion that the bjp's success in the Hindi states is based on hindu-muslim polarization
 varanasi ke sabhi virgon ke janamat surveykshan se saaf he ki dhruvikaran hi bijepi ke bade vot bank kaa aadhaar nahin
 In the opinion of about 54 percent of the voters, communal tension in the city did not increase due to Modi contesting from here
 aashcharya ki 47 fisadi muslim bhi isse sahamat hai
 But if Modi leaves Varanasi seat as MP from Vadodara, will he vote for BJP in the by-election? 29 percent say no
 par 27 fisadi kehete hai ki ve har haal main bijepi ke saath rahenge
 According to the survey, Modi's candidature is the reason for the excitement in Varanasi
 log modi ko chunauti dene ke liye rahul gandhi ke varanasi pahunchane se katai utsahit nahin hai
 Kejriwal, who specializes in attracting crowds, is also facing a question of leaving the government in Delhi on February 24 on the issue of Jan Lokpal
 surveykshan main do-tihaai se zyada logon ne unke us kadam ko galat bataaya
 Varanasi is hoping to give the next Prime Minister to the country
 modi ne varanasi ke aam voter ke is sapane main chaar chand laga die hai
 If he wins, will he be able to fulfill the aspirations of the city? Dhananjay Joshi is an election expert and director of New Delhi's Cicero Associates & Consultants Pvt

 biimaar garibon ke liye ek hi sahaara hota he - sarkari aspataal, lekin uttar pradesh main bulandshahr ke sarkari aspataal ab bimaaron ko zindagi nahin, maut baant rahe hai, or yahaan ke sweepar (safaikarmi) or wardbvoy aajkal doctoron kaa bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 These sweepers and wardboys of Bulandshahar District Hospital do all that, for which MBBS doctors who are getting fat salary are kept in these hospitals
 or is sachai kaa sabase zyaada khatarnaak pahalu yah he ki yah sab aspataal ke siemes, yani mukhya chikitsadhikari, kii jhandabardaari main hi ho rahaa he
 In the hospital on which the state government spends hundreds of crores of rupees every year, due to corruption and commissioning, according to the information of CMS Shishir Srivastava, the cleaning staff stitches the wounds of injured children in the presence of doctors on duty in the emergency ward here
 , And Wardboy injects them
 marijon kii jaan se khilwaad kaa yah silsilaa is ward main kai maheenon se jari he
 The comments yahi nahin, isi jila aspataal ke parisar main siemo, yani jile main swasthya vibhaag ke mukhiya, kaa bhi karyaalay he, lekin vah bhi laaparvaahee main peeche nahin hai
 The CMO is said to have not visited the Emergency ward for several months
 ullekhneey he ki rajya sarkaar pradesh se jholachhap doctoron kaa unmoolan karne par tuli he, lekin sarkari aspataalon main marijon kii zindagi se khel rahe in haathon or jholachhap doctoron main bhala kya antar he
 Now the question is that the Samajwadi Party which came to power in the state by raising slogan of providing law and order and better health facilities to the people, now under the rule of this, will poor and helpless people fall prey to these educated doctors 
 rajya sarkaar jis aspataal par har saal saikadon karod rupee kharch karti he, usee main bhrashtachar or kamishankhori ke chalate siemes shishir shrivastav kii jaankaree main yahaan ke emergency ward main duty par tainaat doctoron kii maujuudagi main hi safai karmchaaree ghayal bacchon ke zakhmon par taanke lagaataa he, or wardbvoy unhen injection lagaataa he
 This sequence of messing with the lives of patients has been going on in this ward for several months

e
 the head of the health department in the district, but he is also not lagging behind in negligence
 bataaya jaataa he ki siemo ne kai maheenon se emergency ward main koi daura kiya hi nahin he
 It is noteworthy that the state government is bent on eradicating the hawkish doctors from the state, but what is the difference between these hands and hawks doctors playing with the lives of patients in government hospitals
 ab sawaal yah he ki jo samaajawaadee party pradesh main kanoon-vyavastha or janata ko behatar swasthya suvidhaayen dene kaa naaraa lagaakar satta main ai thi, ab usee ke raaj main kya garib or bebas log in be-padhe-likhe doctoron ke haathon shikaar hote rahenge

 On the tunnel found in Prayagraj, the people said that the Mahabharata period, the forest named Prayagraj, the lakshagriha of Mahabharata period has come into the discussion again
 kuch din pehle khudaai main is khandhar main pattharon kii ek surang dekhi gai
 This tunnel is about four to five feet wide, but only part of the tunnel is visible now
 baaki hissaa mitti main dabaa hua he
 People are saying about the tunnel that this is the same tunnel from which the Pandavas secretly saved their lives in Dwapara Yuga, when they were trapped in the Palace of Lakh
 ab surang milane ke baad khandhar ko phir se mahabharat kaal kaa laakshagrih ghoshit kiye jane kii maang hone lagi he
 It is noteworthy that Duryodhana had prepared a palace of one lakh on the banks of the Ganges to burn the Pandavas alive, which was known to Vidur and he informed the Pandavas about this intention of Duryodhana
 jaankaree milane ke baad pandavon ne ek surang banaai or usamen se ve log chupchaap baahar nikal aae or unki jaan batch gai
 It is also mentioned in Mahabharata, but the exact information of where Lakshagriha was built is not available
 prayagraj se 50 kilometre ganga kinare ek jangal main khandhar he jise laakshagrih ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The name of this place is also registered in government papers
 surang milane ke baad log ise surakshit karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 However, what remains in this tunnel and what kind of tunnel it is, the suspense remains intact
 ganga kii durdasha, ghatata pani or badhati ret ke bich centre sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi jal parivahan pariyojna ko ekadusre se jodate hue bihar sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki wo kisi bhi surat main ganga main jahaaj chalaane kii anumati nahin degi
 For this, he is ready to go to the Supreme Court
 ganga kii durdasha or iske liye upaay karne ke liye desh or duniya ko jagaane ke liye bihar sarkaar dilli ke india international centre main 18 or 19 may ko ek kafrence karne ja rahi he
 Bihar Water Resources Minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that there is already a tremendous problem of silt in the Ganges
 aise main ganga main paanch se das meter tak dreging yani khudaai karnaa isaki sehat par gambhir parinaam daalega
 Because then the excavated soil will also create silt in the Ganges water
 aise main rajya main baadh kii samasya or gambhir hogi
 Therefore, the Bihar government will not allow that the Ganga be destroyed further without removing silt
 ganga ke bahaav main rukaawat kii dasha ye he ki baxur main bihar main pravesh karne vaali ganga 102 kilometre duuri tay kar patna ke gandhi ghat tak pahunchati he to chaar ghante lagate hai, lekin bhagalpur pahunchate pahunchate nadi thak jaati he
 The 172 km journey from Bhagalpur to Farakka covers in four days
 ab to andaja lagaaya hi ja saktaa he ki vikaas ke naam par ganga kii kya dasha ho gai he
 Rajiv Ranjan Singh says that due to wrong design of Farakka dam, silt is continuously increasing in the Ganges
 farkka baandh ko 27 lakh kusek pani ke bahaav ke hisaab se dizin kiya gaya he, lekin mokama main banaaya gaya pul 32 lakh kusek pani chodta he
 In this case, frozen water has become a big problem
 ve kehete hai ki farkka sahit anya baandh banaaye jane se roka gaya pani to bah jaataa he lekin ret jam jaati he
 There is neither regular flow nor regular drainage
 aise main ganga main milane valisahayak nadiyontak ke muhane jam ho rahe hai
 The law of the Central Government is such that they are not able to take even a single hour of water for the people of the state
 vahiin rajya ko baadh kii vibheeshikaa apane dam par hi jhelni hoti he
 Namami Gange's play is different from that
 gauratlab he ki ganga par banaaye gayi baandhon kii vajah se bihar main ganga apni tay raah chhodkar patna main hi chaar kilometre dakshin kii ore khisak gai he
 The flood affected area is increasing
 isi vajah sehiest flud levelbhi kaaphi upar khisak gaya he
 The Chitle Committee, formed by the central government, in its report has pointed out the problem of silt as well as flaws in the design of the Farakka dam, but nothing happened

 manmohan singh kii sabase badi naakaami yah thi ki ve nakaaratmak sanvaadon kii tsunami ko tham nahin sake, jisane antat sarkaar ko chakanachur kar diya

 Vetal of fiery Hindutva has always been on the back of the BJP, which has come forward by pushing back the virtuous, formless calls of good governance, while on the other hand, the assessment of not being able to do anything concrete in the government or change on the ground is clear
 Reforms that thicken the feeling of emptiness
 sarkaar ke sanvaadon ko sakaaratmak banaae rakhane main vifaltaa kaa kshobh modi ke bhaashanon main jhalkata he
 In his public meetings before going to the US, Modi was cursing the Congress to stop development, while his speeches in the US focused on emotional and nationalist issues rather than 16 months of governance which were part of the efforts to keep the spirit alive
 modi ke in prayaason ke baavjood sarkaar kaa viraat prachaar tantra ummid bhari bahason ko tham paane main chook rahaa he
 Sanctions of the ban are destroying the talk of state governments, development and reforms, while the Union Minister (nitin Gadkari), who is blaming the bureaucracy for sluggishness in work, is becoming the eyes of the government's helplessness
 sanvaadon kaa mizaaj badalane kii do vajahen saaf dikhti hai
 First, Modi's election campaign was an example of spectacular preparations but BJP was not ready for governance
 bhoomi adhigrahan, jiesti, van rank, van pension or videsh main kaale dhan jaise muddon par fajihat sabit karti he ki chunaavon se pehle koi taiyaari nahin kii gai or satta main aane ke baad bhi jatil faislon par samvaad yaa kramshah pragati sabit karne kaa koi tantra viksit nahin hua
 The second reason is probably that Modi has failed to choose an effective symbol to convey his governance
 pichley 16 maah main sarkaar ne kam se kam do darjan nai pahal (mishan, skim, aadi) kii hai lekin inamen se koi bhi prayog mahasoos karne laayak badlaav nahin de sakaa
 All government initiatives are symbolic and state-level, without a concrete implementation framework and lack of coordination with the states
 vaajapeyi kaa kaarykaal kai maamalon main modi ke liye naseehat or nazeer ban saktaa he
 Vajpayee too came to power after three short-lived governments in a spate of expectations and his government was also at risk of radical Hindutva
 vaajapeyi ne vimarsh ko vikaas par kendrit rakhane or ugr hindutv se duuri banane ke liye gavarnence ke lakshyon kaa road map pehle hi tay kar diya tha jinke sahare, 2001 main shila pujan or ram mandir andolan kaa bigul bajane tak sarkaar kai sudharatmak kadam uthaa chuki thi
 Modi's trouble is that he has neither been able to fix concrete floors of reforms and governance around which far-reaching expectations can be discussed, nor has he chosen large infrastructure projects and constructions like Vajpayee's that have led to a strong start of governance Can
 modi ne apekshaaon ko pankh laga die hai, ek-tarafa sanvaadon kii niti chuni he or skiimon ke kachhuon par sawari kii he, isliye kuch na badalane kaa shor tej hone laga he
 On December 24, 2014, in the same column, we wrote that Modi would have to set practical goals of his governance to avoid the fury of militant Hindutva, or else his family yogis, Sakshi and Sadhvi would have him in 2002 for the next few months
 Will make modi kaa taaja asamanjas 2001 ke vaajapeyi jaisaa he, tamaam sudhaaron ke baavjood vaajapeyi ugr hindutv ke agrahon kii chapet se batch nahin sake
 In 2001, a front was opened between the government and the VHP regarding Ayodhya
 2002 kii shuruyaat hone tak, shila pujan ko lekar takaraav, tanaav badha, godhra main train jali, gujarat ke dange hue or maahaul vishakt ho gaya
 Vajpayee tried his best in economic reforms in 2002 and '03
 2003 ke ant main teen vidhansabhaayen bhi jeetin lekin desh ko sabase acchhee gavarnence va sabase tej growth dene vaali sarkaar 2004 main waapas nahin lauti
 The discourse that emerged from the communal tensions of 2002 swallowed the unmatched performance of the Vajpayee government
 yakeenan, loktantr main faislon main apni ek gati he, lekin sarkaar se jude sanvaadon main sakaaraatmakataa anivaary he
 Fresh negative dialogue, move towards disenchantment before Modi has to dismiss the militant Hindutva and return to a solid discussion that arouses expectations while rationalizing expectations
 bharat main is samay shaayad hi koi doosraa netaa aisa hoga jo modi se behatar is baat ko samaj saktaa ho ki agar vimarsh badalen to logon kii raay or siyasat badalane main vakt nahin lagata

 Before i make my point, let me make it clear that this letter is not the name of a 'child' to a 'mamtamayi' minister, but this letter is to another political person who is doing politics of a particular ideology
 sabase pehle main yah spasht kar duun ki main kisi bhi vyakti kii yogyata kaa akalan uski shaikshanik yogyata ke aadhaar par nahin karata hum balki saaf-saaf kahuun to main 'yogyata'(merit) ke puure concept ko khaarij karata hum
 In addition to taking charge of the Ministry of Human Resources, it is expected that you will be responsible for this by honoring their autonomy in the central universities of this country
 rohit vemula ke maamle menaapane kya kiya yah sabake saamne he ki kis tarah se vahaan ke prashasan par aapane dabaav daalaa jiskaa nateeja rohit ke institutional murder ke rup main hamaare saamne aayaa
 But i don't want to talk about all these things right now
 aap baar-baar apni aurat hone kii pahchaan (aaidentity) ko assert karatin hai or isko karnaa bhi chahie kyonki nari jati un dher saare haashiye par kiye gaye logon main ek he jinako sadiyon se shoshit kiya gaya he
 i want to ask you that what is your responsibility as a woman, a Dalit woman who was struggling to give her sons and daughters a respectable place in this society on her own, while taking all the trouble Was it made? Shouldn't you have stood with the woman bowing her head in front of her bravery, saluting the spirit of the woman? Yes, i am talking about Rohit's mother
 jo mahila is brahamnavaadi va pitrusattatmak samaaj se ladi ja rahi thi, apane bacchon ko apane pahchaan se jod rahi thi, us mahila ko aap va aapaki sarkaar uske pati kii pahchaan se kyun jod rahe the? aapako bhi acha lagata hoga kii aapaki apni ek swatantra pahchaan he
 But why were you snatching this right from the woman? Do you also stand in favor of patriarchal and Brahminical society? While stating your full name, you asked questions about your caste and before your speech was over, people removed your caste
 main aapaki jati ke bare main koi dilchaspee nahin rakhata hum or main yah bilkul nahin maanata hum kii agar aap ucch jati ke hote hai to aap jativaadee hi honge lekin aapke vibhaag / mantralay ke taraf se jo chitthiyaan likhi gai usame rohit or uske saathiyon ko jativaadee / caste-ist bataaya
 Madam, do you understand the difference between caste-ism and caste assertion? i think you understand this difference very well because the RSS that runs your government and ministry, considers caste system as the soul of Indian society in the name of varna system and the political determination to implement RSS agenda
 - See you in time
 mujhe ummid he ki aapane manusmriti padhi hogi or aapako jaankaree hogi ki aar es es manusmriti ke mulyon ko lekar kitni raajnneetik patibaddhta rakhti hai

 main ek dalit hone ke kaaran isko pard kar kaaphi apamaanit evam baichaiyn mahasoos karata hum lekin ek nari hone ke kaaran aap ke andar yah baichaini kyon utpann nahin hotin? aadipana bhaashan dete samay jitna bhavuk hone kii koshish karatin hai, lagbhag safal bhi hotin hai, wo bhavukta kya manusmriti padhane ke samay bhi hoti he? agar aapane manusmriti ko ab tak nahin padhaa he to ummid karata hum ki us kitaab ko padhane ke baad ek nari hone ke kaaran aap turant bhaajapa chhodengi or usase pehle kisi dalit saansad, jo kii udit raaj bhi ho sakate hai, ke saath milakar sansad main hin manusmriti kaa dahan karengi
 You screamed in your speech that politics is happening over Rohit's death
 madam shaayad aap itani naasamajh nahin hai ki aap yah nahin jaanati hai ki rohit kii mrityu bhagava raajnneeti kaa parinaam thim
 Rohit was against right-wing politics, whose carrier you are also, which he had to pay for by losing his life
 phir bhi rohit kii mahanata dekhiye ki usne aapako maaf kiya
 Today your government and organization want to make every university in this country a graveyard of students
 pehle IIT madras, FTII, phir HCU, AU, or ab JNU
 In our case you referred to the inquiry committee in Parliament, but don't you remember that your letters going to Hyderabad were pressurizing the decision of the inquiry committee there? What happened in our case? Without being heard, we are de-barred
 lekin kya aapako natural justise kaa ye siddhanth nahin malum he ki ek vyakti kii baat sune bina aap nirnay nahin le sakate he
 Shouldn't you have been careful while reading our name in Parliament that the Inquiry Committee's decision should be awaited? You talked about Mahishasura Martyrdom Day
 kya aapako yah nahin malum he ki is desh main tamaam tarah kii dharmik bhavanaaen (jisamen aapkaa vishwaas nahin he )hai
 The constitution of this country has given everyone equal rights and freedom
 kya aap yah nahin jaanati hai kii is desh ke kuch hisson main dalit va adivasee mahisasur ke saath apni dharmik bhavanaaen jodate hai? mai ek communist hoon or dharm main vishwaas nahin karata, lekin mai yah maanata hoon ki kisi bhi vyakti ko apni dharmik manyataon ko tay karne kaa uskaa apana adhikaar he or rahi baat kisi bhi mahila ke charitra hanan kii to is mudde par bhi je en you ke vampanthi partiyon ke parche hamaare sanghee register ke paas hai
 Please read it by asking for it too
 aapane is desh ke nyaayalayon kii charchaa karte hue yah bataane kii koshish kii ki agar ham nyaayalay ke paas kisi nyaayik upachaar ke liye jate he to ham us sanstha par sawaal nahin uthaa sakate
 You have a very small understanding
 aapke hisaab se agar sochaa jaae to iskaa matlab yah he ki agar koi majdoor kisi kaarkaane main kaam kar rahaa he or vahaan se vah vetan le rahaa he to uske prati hone vaale shoshan vah anyaay ke khilaaf vah nahi bolegaa
 i reject this argument from one end, i believe that in order to make any organization better, it is necessary to ruthlessly debate its faults / shortcomings / weaknesses and improve it further
 iske sivaa bhi aapane or bhi bahut baaten kii
 After listening to all these things, can you really be considered foolish? Or is it something else? We all know that your current government is facing the most challenges in the country from students, farmers and intellectuals
 isiilie aar es es ke nishane par yah varg puri tarah se hai
 The students had opened a front against your fascist attitude even before your government was formed
 aapaki sarkaar aar es es ke saanskrithik rashtrawaad, jise korporate samarthan mila hua he, ke agenda ko lagu karne ke liye puri tarah patibaddh he
 And for that it is necessary that the ability to think and reason with the society should be removed
 chunki vishvavidhyalay tark or vaigyaniktaa kii jagah hote he, isiilie swaabhaavik nishane par ham aae
 You have become so engrossed in implementing the Brahmanical Hindutva nationalism and corporate agenda of the RSS that you have vowed to ruin the value that any university should have to remain
 aap apni raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke prati jo ki bahusamskritwad main vishwaas nahin rakhti he, ke saath khadi hai or ham bahusamskritwad ke saath khadey hai, ham aapse kisi bhi raham kii ummid nahin karte hai or jitna tej ho sake prahaar kiijie ham bhi apni takat bator kar ke puure haunsale se aapkaa saamana karenge
 i will finish my talk by saying the last thing, once someone had protested outside your house, you were trying to cry in front of the camera and citing the fear of your children, but my mother is not crying Yes, just a little worried but still it is being said that do not be afraid to keep fighting Modi

 Amid continuous criticism of the pitches being used in the Test series against South Africa, Team India director and former captain Ravi Shastri has said that there is no flaw in these pitches and stop criticizing it
 unhone do took lahaze main poocha ki kya teen din ke bheetar test match khatm hone main koi buraai he
 He asked why no one questioned the pitch when the Test in Nottingham was over in two days
 ravi shastrine kaha, ‘pichon main koi kharaab nahin he
 i hope to get a similar pitch in Delhi
 mujhe isse koi shikaayat nahin he
 India lead 2–0 in four-match series

 However, South Africa did not complain about it
 shastri ne kaha ki test match teen din ke bheetar khatm hone main koi buraai nahin he
 He even went so far as to say that in Delhi too he wants a pitch similar to Nagpur
 takanic main kami ke kaaran out hueshastri ne kaha, ‘isamen koi buraai nahin he
 The match was a tie in Nagpur
 is match kii perth test se tulana karen to main is match ko dekhnaa chaahunga
 He said that those who criticize pitches should understand that batsmen are out because of the lack of their technique, not because of pitches
 unhone kaha, ‘isse dikhataa he ki krij par lambey samay tak khadey rahane kii kala khatm ho rahi he
 This has happened due to playing more ODI cricket
 is tarah kii pichon par khilne se hi pataa chalegaa ki krij par samay bitaana jaruri he
 Playing with restraint, Shastri said, "when you were watching Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis batting, you must have felt that there was no defect in the pitch
 isi tarah kii pichon par pehle ballebaaj shatak banaate aae hai kyonki ve iske liye taiyaar rahete the
 The former India captain said that batsmen playing with restraint can still score centuries on these pitches
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki sabar se khilne par 80-90 ran, yahaan tak ki shatak banaaya ja saktaa tha
 The way Murali Vijay was playing, he could score a century
 unhone kaha, ‘pich main koi dikkat nahin he
 The pitch is the same for both teams
 is pich par 275 yaa 250 kaa score kaaphi tha
 Stop complaining about this and focus on your work
 ’pich par asmaan oochaal nahin thashasthri ne kaha, ‘misaal ke taur par bangaleru kii pich shandaar thi
 i am sorry that we could not take a 3-0 lead
 acchhee pich par dakshin africa ko out karke hamane bina kisi nuksaan ke 80 ran bana liye the or agle chaar din dabaav banaakar rakh sakate the
 People will not talk about him
 unhone is aalochana ko bhi khaarij kiya ki nagpur main pich main asmaan oochaal tha
 He said, 'where was the uneven boom
 thik hi tha
 After the second or third day, the ball started to slow down
 aap mujhe bataai ki koun sa ballebaaj neeche kii ore jaati gend par out hua, sirf duusari pari main mishra yaa phalf du plasis ko chhodkar
 "we do not complain about foreign pitches" Shastri agreed with the statements of Virat Kohli and r Ashwin that foreign pitches are never complained in India
 unhone kaha ki jab bhartiya team videsh jaati he to kabhi vahaan kii pichon kii shikaayat nahin karti
 He said, 'when we go abroad we don't have options
 aap kyon shikaayat karenge
 Nobody complains
 sirf ve hi shikaayat karte hai jinhone kabhi cricket nahin kheli he
 "let them (former Australian cricketers) sit in Australia and talk about their pitches," he said

 agar aisa bhi ho paata he, to yah iran kii bahut badi jeet maani jaaegi
 But let Messi and his team be like that, it cannot be said exactly before the match

 hamen sahansheel banaata he or rishton kii garima ko samajhakar unhen bikharane nahin detaa balki apnatv ke ahsaas se bharpoor unhen ek nai urja pradaan karata he
 This is the message of Alka's story and the essence of life that every reader is lost by reading the story and that story becomes an event of the life of that reader, and not only the story of Alka's story collection, also has a profound effect on every mind
 'murde itihaas nahin likhte' kahani preranaprad he or man ko jhakzor kar yah sandesh detii he ki yadi apana rasta ham khud banaate hai to hamamen aatmavishvaas bhi jaagrath hota he or hamaari apni pahchaan bhi banati he or yahi pahchaan hamen bheed se alag karti he
 There is an ease in the stories of Alka, the truth of life is why the flow of stories does not stop, but with ease and ease every story moves forward, descends deeply into the heart
 vednaa or phirjivan kii sachchaiko sweekaar kar usase jujhane or ladane kaa saahas bhi alka kii kahaniyon se miltaa he
 The 'tikuli' story is very touching
 'nadi abhi sukhi nahin' main rishton kii sachai he
 Beyond caste and religion, it is only human sensibilities that teach us to live and be devoted to each other
 alka soi hui maanviya samvednaaon ko naa keval apni kahaniyon ke madhyam se jagaati hai balki pathakon ko bhav pravan bhi banaati hai
 Some of the stories in Alka Agarwal's collection are such that they do not even require any word features, but they enter into the tropes of our mind and instill sensations
 alka ke katha sangrah kii kahaniyaan kaalpanik nahin balki satya kathaon kaa sa abhas karaati hai
 Alka does not seem to have had to make any effort but rather the events have taken the shape of words and the story has been created
 apane shilp or kathy donon main hi sabhi kathaayen man par gaharaa prabhaav chhodti hai
 It is hoped that in future also, Alka will provide a new energy to the readers by collecting such a story full of poignant and sensitive feelings

 ganesh gayatonde (nawazuddin Siddiqui) laachaar he or samudr ke bichombich fansaa hua he
 Then there is Trivedi's entry and Ganesh Gaitonde realizes that there are many people ahead of him
 lekin ganesh ko to isa se badla lenaa he
 But Ganesh Gaitonde cannot even do this work of his own free will
 ganesh gayatonde (ganesh Gaitonde) bombai se darbadar ho chukaa he or kenya main sangharsh kar rahaa he
 But he calls Sartaj Singh's father constantly and then gets advice to find a guru for himself
 is tarah guruji kii entry hoti he or pankaj treepathi guruji ke role main najar aate hai
 Not only this, Ganesh takes revenge on Gaitonde Parulkar too and Parulkar has to take revenge on him as well
 kahani pehle se bhi zyada jabardast he or editing bahut hi kamaal kii he

 5 somvaar, 5 agast ko dopaher dhai baje lakhanu main upi ke mukhyamantri nivas kii ore jane vaale kalidas maarg ko vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon, kaaryakartaaon ne gher rakhaa tha
 The protesters carrying flags in their hands were slogans in favor of suspended IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal and demanding suspension of the government
 aisi sabhi gatividhiyon par najar jamaaye mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav apane sarkari awaas 5, kalidas maarg par adhikariyon ke saath soobe main shuru hone vaali kai nai yojanaon ko antim rup dene main vyast the
 Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav discussed in detail the latest political situation in the state with India Today Senior Editor Bhavna Vij Arora and Chief Correspondent Ashish Mishra
 pesh he unase baatcheet ke pramukh anshahapake mukhyamantri banane par janata ne bahut ummiden lagaai thim
 But 17 months after the formation of Samajwadi Party (SP) government in the state, people are disappointed
 unhen lagata he ki pradesh main gunda raaj laut aayaa he?yah saraasar galat dharna he
 Since the formation of the SP government, a lot of good work has been done in the fields of roads, IT, agriculture, health and dairy farming
 in vikaas kaaryon kii koi charchaa nahin kar rahaa
 i promised to give free laptops to the students in the election which is being fulfilled well
 upi ek bada rajya he is kaaran yahaan kai samasyaayein bhi hai jinhen dur karne main thodaa vakt lagegaa
 Development will now become the identity of UP
 ab kanoon vyavastha par sawaal uthne lage hai
 Nearly 100 communal riots have taken place since the formation of the SP government in the state, while there was not a single one during the time of former Chief Minister Mayawati? i agree that there has been tension in some places but due to poor law and order situation
 choti-si baat ko bada banane main vipakshi partiyon kii badi bhoomika he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does the incident and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supports it
 yahi partiyaan upi main gundaraj hone kaa kuprachaar kar rahi hai
 Your government is also facing allegations of Muslim appeasement
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki sapa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main musalamaanon kaa vot paane ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakati he?musalamaanon ne sapa ke liye bahut kiya he
 My government or SP is not appeasing the Muslims
 yah vah tabaka he jo samaaj main dusron ke mukaable kaaphi pichhadaa he
 We are just trying to make them equal
 is par kisi ko aapatti nahin honi chahie
 The real reason for the suspension of Durga is believed to be the action taken against the mining mafia, while your government has tried to get the sympathy of the Muslims by accusing them of demolishing the mosque wall? The truth is that the only reason for the suspension of Durga
 In the month of Rajman, the action was to demolish the mosque wall
 yah karrwai karne main is iees adhikari ne paripakvata kaa parichay nahin diya
 If there was any illegal construction happening then notice should have been given earlier
 uske baad aage kii karrwai kerani chahie thi
 This was a sensitive subject, which was handled in a very irresponsible manner
 isse ilaake main shanti bhang hone kii ashanka thi
 As far as mining is concerned, Durga was never stopped from taking action against it
 sarkari report main is baat kaa zikr he ki behad shantipurna dhang se masjid kii diwaar dhahaai gai or isse kanoon-vyavastha bigadgaye kii koi ashanka nahin thi?mujhe pakki jaankaree he ki durga gaanv main bulldozer, fire brigade lekar gai thim
 He announced in the village that until the wall of the mosque collapses, she will remain in the village, even if it requires two-three days
 gaanvvaalon ne iske khilaaf agle din panchayat kaa elaan kiya tha
 Who would have responded if they had taken a tough decision in the panchayat
 kya aapako pataa tha ki durga ke nilamban kaa maamla itnaa tool pakadega?mujhe is baat kii katai ashanka nahin thi ki yah maamla is str tak pahunch jayega
 In fact, two days before Durga's suspension, there was a statement from Union Minister Jairam Ramesh in which he had said that MNREGA money is being spent less in UP
 tabhi maine pramukh sachiv graamy vikaas se un 10 jilon kii suchi laane ko kaha jinka pradarshan manaregaa main sabase kharaab he
 i also ordered the DM and CDO of two of these 10 districts to be suspended immediately
 yahi nahin ek aadesh agra vikaas praadhikaran ke upaadhyaksh ke nilamban kaa bhi diya jo jile main ‘‘inner cirkil road’’ ke nirmaan main laaparvaahee kar rahe the
 The suspension of the vice president was also signed by the chief secretary
 iske alaava ek anya iees adhikari ke bare main apane karyaalay main sabake saamne cigarette pine kii shikaayatein mil rahi thim
 All of them were to be suspended along with Durga but the order of suspension of Durga went to Bangalore in the very next day and when she returned, the matter had a lot of grip
 agar ye saare afasar kram se nilambit hote to itnaa bavaal nahin hota
 Now due to Durga, her suspension was stopped because if i do this now people will say that i have fallen behind IAS
 durga ke ek mahila adhikari hone or dilli ke najadik tainaati hone kii vajah se media ne is prakaran ko jamkar uchhaala
 But even the IAS officers of the state do not agree with your decision
 iees association ne bhi durga ke samarthan main kai str par prayaas kiye?pichhali mayawati sarkaar main ek pramukh sachiv kii unke ghar par sandigdh maut ho gai thi to yahi iees adhikari apane sahyogi ke paksh main bolne kii himmat tak na juta paae the
 Recently i went to Unnao
 maine vahaan ke dm se kaha ki mujhe vahaan us gehun kharid centre par le chalo jahaan sabase acha kaam ho rahaa ho
 The DM told me that he has not inspected a single center
 mere paas vaazib vajah thi use maukey par nilambit karne kii lekin dm ne turant galati maan lee or maine use maaf kar diya
 Maybe it's my fault
 mujhe adhikariyon ko pehle se hi thik karke rakhana chahie tha
 Private medical colleges in many cities of the country are auctioning doctors' degrees through donations
 ajtakane sting oparation ke jariye ye khulaasa kiya he ki rajdhani dilli se sate ballabhagarh, hapur auki gajiabad jaise shaharon ke kai aise medical college hai jahaan embibies kii siten lakhon rupee main khuleam bechi ja rahi he
 Whereas the Supreme Court directs that no college can charge any donation or capitation fee in the name of admission
