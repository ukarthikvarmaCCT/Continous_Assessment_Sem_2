 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, "there is a trend these days that such activities are carried out, so that free discussion is available
" sarkaar ko doshiyon ke khilaaf sakhti se karrwai kerani chahie
 Thus the incident was also seen in the context of Prashant Bhushan and Sharad Pawar
 ’’ Rudy said, "A few months ago we saw that Ramdev and his supporters were lathi-charged to take them out of Ramlila Maidan
 kathith taur par centre sarkaar kii ore se police kaa aatank logon ko jhelana padaa tha
 "he said," BJP believes that today's incident may have been created by the UPA government
 sarkaar par pehle se andeh he ki bhrashtachar or kaledhan ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon par vah badale kii karrwai karti he
 The UPA government has to prove itself clean in this incident and this matter should be thoroughly investigated
 ramdev kii puri suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie
 '' Comments congress ne bhi is ghatana kii ninda kii or kaha ki ramdev par hamale kaa sarkaar se unke virodh se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Party spokesperson Rashid Alvi said, "whatever has happened is very unfortunate
 sabhi ko apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar he or koi kuch galat karata he, to main uski ninda karata hum
 i am confident that the law will take its action
 ’’ congress ne yah bhi kaha ki har vyakti ko adhikaar he ki vah kisi bhi raajnneetik dal kaa virodh kar saktaa he
 Party General Secretary Digvijay Singh has also condemned the incident and said that a thorough investigation should be carried out on who threw black ink on Ramdev's face
 rajd pramukh lalu prasad ne kaha ki doshi ke khilaaf kadi karrwai honi chahie
 He said that such an event is done to gain cheap popularity
 rudi ne kaha, ‘‘kuch maheene pehle hamane dekha tha ki ramdev or unke samarthakon par ramlila maidan se baahar nikaalane ke liye lathicharge kiya gaya tha
 Allegedly, the police had to bear the terror of the central government
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki aaj kii ghatana samprag sarkaar kii ore se rachi gai ho sakati he
 The government already suspects that it takes revenge on those who raise their voice against corruption and black money
 samprag sarkaar ko is ghatana main khud ko paak-saaf sabit karnaa he or is maamle kii puri jaanch honi chahie
 Ramdev should be provided complete security
 ’’tippaniyan The Congress also condemned the incident and said that the attack on Ramdev had nothing to do with his opposition to the government

 ek haar or badalane lagi bijepi
 
 
 “the people of Bihar change anyone
 ” bihar kii chunavi haar ke baad bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne party netritv ke badale mizaaj or ranneeti ke sawaal par yah sateek tippanee kii thi, jisaki jhalak 8 april ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii ore se paanch rajyon ke adhyakshon kii niyukti main saaf taur par dikhi
 However, it started in Assam itself when the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed the strategy of contesting elections in the states and handed over the command of Assam, advancing Sarbananda Sonowal
 ab party ne usee kadi main saamaajik-kshetreey sameekaran or kad kaa khyaal rakhte hue karnataka, punjab, uttar pradesh, telugana or arunachal pradesh main nae adhyaksh tainaat kiye hai
 While the modi-shah era BJP initially ignored the social equation in choosing the Chief Minister in Haryana, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, the message came from it that the party would prefer the lesser rather than the leaders with strong base
 lekin ab paristhitiyaan badalati dikh rahi hai
 Just a week before becoming the president, when the Uttar Pradesh unit asked Shah for the date of the organization's election, he said, "let me have my election first, then i will decide
" ” darasal, shah kii ranneeti faisle se pehle gahan mantranaa kii thi
 So after a long process of consultation, on 2 April, Lutyens met for two hours in Delhi with Shah, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Organization General Secretary Ramlal, Joint Organization General Secretary Shiv Prakash and bjp's union co-government minister Krishna Gopal coordinating with BJP, After considering various aspects, the presidents of five states were announced
 1990 kaa daur dohraane kii koshingle saal hone vaala uttar pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ke liye behad rochak or chunauteepurn hone ja rahaa he kyonki upi ne hi modi lahar ke jowar main shah ko rashtriya adhyaksh pad kii dahalij par pahunchaaya tha
 But now the election of the state is the biggest challenge of Shah's presidency under the Modi wave
 is paristhiti se waakif shah ne jaldbaaji main koi faisla lene kii bajaae pradesh adhyaksh pad kii daud main shaamil aadha darjan naamon par gambhirtha se vichaar vimarsh kar samuhik nirnay kii disha main kadam badhaayaa
 a panel consisting of Dharmpal Singh from the backward class, Swatantradev Singh, Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha and National Vice President Dinesh Sharma was prepared for the UP President
 lekin 2 april ko sangh ke sah sarkarywah krishna gopal kii maujuudagi main bijepi ke sheersh netaaon kii nirnaayak baithak main sabhi pahaluon par vichaar hua
 According to sources, even before this meeting, the province and regional campaigners of UP had expressed their opinion to make the president from the OBC category
 lihaaja shah kii pehali pasand manoj sinha is daud se baahar ho gaye
 After this, the names of the leaders associated with the OBC were considered
 vinay katiyaar or omprakash singh ke naam par charchaa hui lekin purv ke anubhav or saamaajik samikarnon kii vajah se in naamon ko chhod diya gaya
 Both leaders are from the Kurmi community and the party already has an alliance with the Apna Dal which has influence of this society
 iske alaava lodh samaaj se jude dharmpal singh ke naam ko bhi isliye khaarij kar diya gaya kyonki sutron ke mutabik, purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh or kendriya mantri uma bharti unke khilaaf the or unhen rajnath kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 On the other hand, the BJP, which is strategizing to expand its social base, focused on the new equation
 chunki dharmpal ke kshetra ruhelkhand main party kii sthiti acchhee he, isliye usne is baar teen vajahon se purvanchal card khilne kii manshaa banaai or phulpur se saansad keshav prasad maury kaa sitara chamak uthaa
 First, the bjp's position in the region is so weak that heavyweights like Murali Manohar Joshi and Kesharinath Tripathi have suffered defeat and, barring the 2014 general election, the party's bail has been forfeited in most seats
 duusari- chunaav se pehle hi jis tarah bispi ke paksh main maahaul bana he or mayawati kaa prabhaav bad rahaa he, usase chintit bijepi ne kushvaha voton par chot karne kii sochi jo amuman bispi kaa vot bank rahaa he
 The BJP had once brought Babu Singh Kushwaha, who was close to Mayawati, to the party at the time of the Lok Sabha elections
 maury bhi kushvaha samaaj se hai jiske 3-4 fisadi matadaata hai
 Third- up's Nitish Kumar's JD (U) and Ajit Singh's RLD are going to merge and Nitish Kumar himself is busy building a base in Purvanchal
 bhagava parivaar upi main 1990 ke shuruaati daur main apanaai gai ranneeti par aage bad rahaa he jo bijepi kaa svarnim kaal tha
 The party played the upper and backward cards at that time and the Ram Mandir movement was at its peak, after which the party came to power in 1991 with 221 seats
 1996 tak party kii sthiti thik rahi
 But after that the phase of overthrow started
 is baar bhi party ne savarna voton ko apana maanate hue ati pichhadaa card khelaa he
 On the other hand, from July this year, the Supreme Court will begin hearing on the Ram temple issue in which BJP leader Subramanian Swamy will demand a daily hearing, which will not be possible for the central government to back down
 aise main mandir masalaa rajnatik mudda banataa he to ugr hindutvvaadi chhavi vaale maury bijepi ke siyaasi khaanche main feet baithenge
 a senior BJP leader presently comments, "it is a great feature of the Sangh that it has brought most of the faces of Hindutva-fiery Hindutva - Kalyan, Uma, Katiyar, Sakshi Maharaj, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti etc
 backward
 ”haalanki bijepi ne ati pichhadaa kaa najuk or samvedansheel daanv khelaa he
 But Uttar Pradesh has a different situation than Bihar in political terms
 bihar main savarna 14 to upi main kareeb 27-28 fisadi hai
 In Bihar, due to Lalu Yadav, the upper castes have no option but to BJP, but in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections in UP, Thakur has gone with the SP and in the 2007 assembly elections, the Brahmins have gone with the BSP
 isse waakif shah ab mukhyamantri yaa chunaav abhiyaan ke mukhiya ke liye savarna ummidavaaron par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Tired and defeated in Lingayat and Dalit Dawnkarnataka, the BJP has finally been forced to return to the same path that was sidelined in 2012
 rajya main lingayat samudaay behad prabhavi he, isliye party ne purv mukhyamantri bi
 s
 yeddiurppa ko adhyaksh kii kaman saunp di he
 Although MLA for Karnataka President C
 tii
 Ravi's name was fixed
 lekin sutron ke mutabik, 2 april kii baithak main kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha, “agar 2018 main karnataka main chunaav jeetna he to yeddiurppa ekmev vikalp hai
 He advocated Ravi to be the chairman and Yeddyurappa as the chief minister
 yeddiurppa rajnath ke adhyakshiya kaarykaal main hi upmukhyamantri, mukhyamantri or pradesh adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 After this, it was decided that from now on the project will be made two power centers in the state organization, so the general opinion was that he should be made the state president
 idhar, kanshiram kii janmabhumi punjab main bijepi ne brahman adhyaksh camel sharma ko hataakar dalit card khelaa he
 The command of the state has been handed over to Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Vijay Sampla
 punjab main bijepi mahaj 23 vidhansabha siton par hi chunaav ladati rahi he lekin ab apana vot share badhaakar akali dal ko dabaav main laana chaahati he
 She is considering the middle class with the party in Punjab, while Jats are not seeing Sikhs in their ranks
 isliye bijepi ne pehali baar 34 fisadi daliton ko lubhaane ke makasad se dalit samudaay ke saanpala par daanv khelaa he
 In order to maintain the influence of the leaders in the field, the party is also ignoring the one person, one post principle
 sonoval kii tarah hi saanpala bhi chunaav tak adhyaksh ke saath mantri pad par bane rahenge
 In Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP has a Sangh background in the new state of Telangana, which emerged on the map of the country
 lakshmana ko kaman saunpi he
 The Munuru Kapu community is one of the dominant caste of obcs
 haalanki yahaan bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv muralidhar raav bhi daud main the, lekin unke hi ek saathi mahasachiv ne unke hyderabad kaa maarg avaruddh kar diya
 Lakshman, a fanatic, had opposed the Telangana government's decision to make tennis player Sania Mirza a brand ambassador, saying she was a Pakistani daughter-in-law
 vichaardhaara ke liye patibaddh lakshmana ko rajya kii kaman saunpane kii vajah&telugana main party kii kamajori ko dur kar ek kader khadaa karne kii he
 On the other hand, by taking advantage of the infighting of the Congress, the BJP has formed a government by supporting the rebel faction headed by Kalikho bridge in Arunachal Pradesh, but it is afraid that the politics of ayaram-gayaram may also harm it
 isliye sangh kii salaah par party aise chehre kii talash main thi jo vichaardhaara ke liye patibaddh ho
 Former National secretary-general Tapir Gav fit this equation
 jaahir he ki shah ke purv ke dedh saal ke kaarykaal main jo mukhyamantri or padaadhikari bane, usamen kshetreey-saamaajik santulan gaun tha, lekin ab bhul-sudhaar karte hue party ne sabhi pakshon ko bharose main lekar nirnay lene kii prakriya shuru kar di he
 It remains to be seen whether by showing a similar equation in the list of possible organizations next month, cabinet reshuffle and nomination for Rajya Sabha seats, Shah will show the maturity to complete it or not once again, will become a parikrama basis

 Efforts are being made in the country these days to resolve the Ayodhya dispute by mutual agreement
 aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar se lekar shiya central vakf board adhyaksh wasim rizvi tak ayodhya main ramamandir banane ke mishan par hai
 Discussions are also being held with hindu-muslim parties, but the matter is yet to be seen
 ayodhya maamle main aisa kanoonee pench he ki muslim pakshakaar ek baar vivaadit sthaan par ramamandir ke liye rajamand bhi jaae, tab bhi court se baahar samjhauta naammumkin he
 Waqf Act becomes a snag, no legal right
 In the year 29 of the Waqf Act, it is clear that mosques, cemeteries, khanqahs, imambaras, dargahs, idgahs, mausoleums cannot be sold, transferred or pledged
 Can be done, cannot be gifted nor can the nature of its use be changed
 ye act sunni or shiya vakf board donon ke liye he
 If anyone works on the contrary, it will be considered illegal
 yahi vajah he ki muslim pakshakaar chaahakar bhi samjhauta nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki unhen koi kanoonee adhikaar nahin hai
 High court's verdict in favor of Sunni Waqf Board that Sunni Waqf Board is lobbying on behalf of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya dispute
 is tarah ye property sunni vakf board kii he
 In 1940, the Shia Waqf Board claimed that the mosque belonged to the Shia community and handed over to them
 hoicourt main sunni vakf board ne majboot daawa pesh karte hue pairvi kii
 In 1946, the District Court rejected the Shia claim and approved the Sunni Waqf Board's claim to the Babri Masjid
 bataa den ki sunni paksh ne tark diya tha ki maujuuda samay main masjid kaa mutavalli or imam sunni hai or ramajaan ke maheene main is masjid main taraavi bhi hoti he
 On this argument of the Sunni side, the court rejected the Shia claim and gave a verdict in the Sunni side
 sunni vakf board ne mukademen ko adapt kiyababari masjid main 1949 main murti rakhi gai to ayodhya ke kshetreey musalamaanon ne mukadmaa daayar kar diya
 Subsequently, in 1961, the Sunni Waqf Board has instituted the case
 tab se is mukademen kii pairvi muslim pakshakaron main sunni vakf board kar rahaa he
 Not only the Babri Masjid, but any property of the Waqf Board, Mutavalli is only the guardian and not the owner
 isiilie muslim pakshakaar chaahakar bhi samjhauta nahin kar sakate hai
 Ayodhya case can be resolved only and only through Supreme Court
 is baat ko muslim personal lau board ke log bakhubi samajhate hai isiilie wo court ke faisle kii baat kar rahe hai
 Former Union Minister and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor will have to appear several times before the Delhi Police's SIT
 guuruuvaar ko hui poochtacha ke baad police ne lila hotel kii galiyaaron main kaid sunanda kii maut ke raaj se pardaa uthaane ke liye ek or rasta talash kar liya he
 Not only is the IPL dazzling on this new route, there are also signs of misuse of Sata
 guuruuvaar ko isi silsile main na keval tharur, balki chah logon se lagaataar ghanton tak poochtacha kii gai
 During the interrogation, only Shashi Tharoor was given a chance to attend his predetermined schedule for a few hours
 police sutron kii maane to guuruuvaar ko hui poochtacha ke dauraan focus sunanda kii maut ke pehle unke press conference kaa mudda or ipel main sunanda ke share par tha
 If sources are to be believed, the SIT is looking for answers to two questions
 guuruuvaar ko hui poochtacha main in sawaalon ke jawaab philhal nahin mil paae hai
 Because of these questions, not only Tharoor, but some other people may have to go through SIT inquiries again and again
 darasal, sunanda pushkar kii maut maamle kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti sabase pehle ye jaananaa chaahati he ki 17 janvari ko sunanda ne kis mudde par press conference yojit karne kaa faisla kiya tha or uske paas tharur ke maamle main aisa kya tha ki unhen sabake saamne benakaab kar dene kii baat kar rahi thi
 Significantly, on January 16, 2014, Sunanda spoke to several journalists
 in patrakaron se poochtacha ke dauraan police ko kuch jaankaree mili
 According to sources, on Thursday, Shashi Tharoor was asked several times by the police, but Tharoor kept answering every time that Sunanda did not have anything that would reveal any of his Gupta Raj
 esaiti ko philhal tharur ke is jawaab par yakeen nahin he, kyonki police ke paas kai aisi chijen hai, jo sabit karti hai ki tharur ko keval yahi nahin kai or baton kii jaankaree he
 That is why Tharoor can be called again and again
 lekin tharur philhal media ke kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 The second biggest question of SIT is related to IPL
 jaanch ke dauraan esaiti ko mili jaankariyon ke mutabik kochi team ko kharidne ke pehle kai daanv-pench khele gaye the
 The SIT has also come to know that shares were not given to Sunanda for any money, but rather their shares fall in the category of sweat shares
 sweate yani kisi vyakti kii mehnat ke badale company main milane vaala share
 Now the police want to find out what Sunanda did that she was given a 70 crore rupees share in the IPL company
 yahi nahin, is company kii boli lagane ke samay bhi dhaandhlee hui
 According to sources, the police have come to know many such things that Tharoor, while minister, did some such things during the bidding of the company, which made it easier to buy the Kochi team
 haalaaki loksabhaa main tharur ne kaha tha ki unhone aisa koi kaam nahin kiya
 Significantly, the company started a diamond business in Gujarat, there were many people in this company who did not have money, but got shares in the form of shares
 ipel main sabase mahangi team kochi taskar 700 karod main kharidi gai thi
 But who are the people in this company, it was not told
 police ko shaq he ki sunanda ko share isliye mila, kyonki tharur ne company kii kharid-bikri main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 It is being told that the diamond merchant had first met Tharoor and asked for help, only after this the company bought and sold the deal
 ab sawaal yah he ki vah company jo kisi tarah kaa kaarobaar nahin karti thi, usamen itane log achaanak share holder kaise bane or nirdhaarit boli kii soochna li kaise hui
 According to SIT sources, Tharoor could not give a satisfactory answer to any question related to this case during the interrogation on Thursday
 police ko shaq he ki yahi vah raaj ho saktaa he, jiskaa khulaasa sunanda press conference ke dauraan karne vaali thi
 Due to Tharoor's defiant attitude on questions, the days ahead for him can be troublesome
 police ne unase isse sambandhit kagajaat bhi maange, jinamein se kuch kagajaat tharur ne shuukravaar ko sarojini nagar thane main jamaa karaayaa

 jharkhand main raghuvar das bijepi ke bade obisi netaa hai
 He has won elections from Jamshedpur East seat
 philhal vah bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai
 Das was the Deputy Chief Minister in the Shibu Soren government in 2009-10
 jharkhand ke beete 14 saal ke itihaas main ab tak koi gaiyr-adivasee mukhyamantri nahin bana he
 Meanwhile, sources are quoting from the news that the BJP may form the deputy CM in Jharkhand and the deputy CM will be the tribal face, although no name has been decided for the deputy CM in today's meeting, but the names of two mlas have come up and they Nilkanth Munda and Shivshankar Oraon
 iske saath hi arjuna munda ko party kaa nayaa upaadhyaksh banaaya jayega
 The BJP and its ally All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU) alliance got a clear majority in the elections for the state assembly
 rajya kii 81 sadasyeey vidhansabha main bhaajapa 37 siton ke saath sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari he, jabaki ajasu ko paanch siten mili hai
 (also from inputs agency) jab pradhanmantri narendra modi 15 june ko apane sarkari awaas, 7 lok kalyaan maarg par ratribhoj menaresaiske kshetreey sanghathan mantriyon se rou-ba-rou hone dining haul main aae to ve is baat se bakhubi waakif the ki surajkund main aresas kii baithak main sanghathan mantri centre sarkaar, bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or party ke saansadon ke prati apni naaraazgi vyakt kar chuke hai
 The Prime Minister reassured them by saying, "BJP President Amit Shah will discuss tomorrow (saturday) about the feedback received from the organization ministers and based on that (in which there is a lot of resentment among the activists against the current 154 mps) the 2019 Framework is set Will be ''
 pradhanmantri ke isi line ko amit shah ne 16 june ko surajkund kii baithak main aage badhaate hue sanghathan mantriyon se mili feedback par muhar laga di
 With this, it became almost clear that in 2019 a large number of existing mps will be deducted
 surajkund main do dinon (15-16 june) tak chali kshetreey sanghathan mantriyon kii baithak se jo nichod niklaa vah nishchit rup se bhaajapa ke liye kadavi dawa he
 During the discussion in the meeting, there were more references to the RSS (regional campaigners / organization ministers), such as lack of coordination with BJP central ministers and mps, lack of trust, rude behavior and lack of dedication to ideology
 saath hi sarkari yojanaon or kriyakalapon ke labhaarthiyon main cader kii ghor upeksha kaa zikr bhi khulkar hua
 How most mps are disconnected from the people of their region
 kaise kshetreey sanghathan mantriyon kii taraf se isko lekar di gai soochna kii andekhi saansadon kii taraf se hui, iskaa silsilewar zikr kiya gaya
 An organization minister present at the meeting explains, "the organization minister associated with Sanskar Bharti and the history compilation scheme, with examples, named ministers and explained which ministers he met for his (rss's) work
" mantriyon kaa apointment paane se lekar unhen apni shikaayat bataane tak ke liye kitne papad belane pade
 When talking about meeting in the office of several ministers or by calling on mobile, the introduction (of regional organization ministers) was asked repeatedly
 amit shah ke saamne kshetreey sanghathan mantriyon ne yah baat rakhi ki bahut se aise mantri hai jinase samay lene ke liye bhaajapa ke sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal or aresas main bhaajapa kaa kaam dekh rahe krishna gopal se phone karwaanaa padaa
 Regional organization ministers also spoke to Babaki that the resentment of mps is highest in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka
 kai jagahon par to logon kii ore se yah poster tak lagaaya gaya he ki, "hamaare saansad ko dhundhakar laane waalon ko inaam diya jayega
 "it is becoming difficult for regional organization ministers to tell people why mps are not able to do any development work in the area
" saansad logon kii shikaayat dur karnaa to dur use sunne tak ke liye uplabdh nahin ho paa rahe hai
 According to sources, Amit Shah has been made aware of the names of 154 such mps, people are very angry about them
 in saansadon main kai kaddavar mantri bhi shaamil hai
 After this meeting, the BJP is not worried only about the fact that people are angry with the party's mps
 darasal chintaa kii vajah duusari he
 Feedback has been received that in areas where BJP mps are disconnected from the public, the leaders of the other party or the candidates lost in the last election have made their penetration among the people quite active
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa laabh logon ko dilwane main duusare dal ke log apni bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Opposition parties are helping to get the benefits of popular schemes like Ujjwala Yojana, Saubhagya Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Farmers Loan Waiver Scheme, Housing Scheme
 to kya pradhanmantri ke us nirdesh kaa koi asar nahin hua jisamen ve har baithak main saansadon se yah kehete rahe ki vah apane kshetra main adhik se adhik samay bitaayen? modi ne saansadon se kaha tha ki ve logon kii samasyaon ko sunen or sarkaar kii yojanaon kaa prachaar-prasar karen or yah dekhen ki logon ko sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh mil rahaa he yaa nahin
 a BJP general secretary confesses to this question, "the party has strong information that despite the prime minister's repeated assertions, many BJP mps are less active in their respective constituencies
 yahaan tak ki ve pradhanmantri ke namo ap par bhi unke good morning tak kaa uttar nahin dete hai
 This matter is quite serious
 '' ye mahasachiv sweekaar karte hai ki saansadon ke sakriy nahin hone kii vajah se sarkari yojanaon kaa laabh sahi dhang se sahi logon tak pahunchnaa kathin he
 Right now a scheme called Samparka Sampark is being run by the BJP
 party kaaryakartaaon ko samaaj ke sabhi pramukh logon se milane kaha gaya he
 Every worker has been asked to contact at least 25 people, but in this too complaints of fraud have started
 yah 2019 main bhaajapa kii mushkil badha sakati he
 It was also mentioned in the meeting that there is still enthusiasm among the people about the popularity of the Prime Minister, but the BJP mps are neither holding the bureaucracy nor they are being heard in the government
 saansad sirf pradhanmantri yaa party ke kehane par ek-do din ke liye gaanvon main jaakar thahar rahe hai
 During this, they give assurance to the people but it is not complete
 duusari taraf virdohi dal ke log niyamit rup se logon ke sampark main hai
 Apart from the separation of people from mps in the meeting, it was discussed for three hours separately that negative discussions have started in 2014 on the promises made by the BJP leadership
 kisaanon kii kheti kii samasya kam hone kii jagah bad rahi he
 The youth are not getting employment and the Dalit oppression has increased so much that this section is getting away from the BJP
 petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton par jo sawaal uth rahe hai, uskaa koi santoshjanak uttar na to saansad na hi mantri de paa rahe hai
 These are all issues on which people of the opposition parties are getting better understanding
 yani virdohi dalon kii baton se log sahamat ho rahe hai
 Sources say that Sarkaryavah Bhaiyaji Joshi has cautioned the BJP president on the basis of these feedbacks that it is very difficult to win elections in 2019 only in the name of Prime Minister Modi
 vipaksh netritvheen he aisa sochna aatmghaatee sabit ho saktaa he kyonki sarkaar ke khilaaf mudde or bhaajapa ke khilaaf virdohi dal jis tarah ekajute ho rahe hai usase paar paanaa asambhav nahin to mushkil jarur he
 These are political equations that have the power to prevent the BJP from coming to power in 2019
 aresas kii salaah he ki sarkaar or bhaajapa apane rukh ko lacheela kare
 They should open the way to dialogue with various ideological parties and avoid unnecessary commentary against the allies who are or have been, because in Indian democracy, the election results are not the only government that decides but the post-result equations matter a lot
 
 taaja udhaaharan karnataka he, jahaan nateezon ke baad ke sameekaran se sarkaar ban gai
 The BJP has also been advised to think on what is the reason that the BJP succeeded in forming a government there even after being the number two party in Goa a few months ago, but what has happened now that despite being the number one party in Karnataka He was forced to sit in opposition

 The Election Commission may again write a letter to the Reserve Bank of India to increase the cash withdrawal limit of the candidates
 ayog ke sutron ke mutabik nakad kharch karne ke liye sabko baraabar mauka dene ke liye chunaav ayog ko ye jaruri lagata he ki chunaav lard rahe ummidavaaron ke liye nakad nikasi kii saptahik seemaa 24 hajaar se badhaakar do lakh kar di jaae
 However, the first appeal of the Commission has been rejected by the Reserve Bank
 ayog ke sutara bataate hai kiriserv bankke is kadam ke baad naaraaz ayog ek baar phir thode sakht lahaze main chitthee likh saktaa he
 Because the Commission believes that the cash withdrawal cap of the Reserve Bank may be a policy decision for the common people but it is too much for the candidates contesting the elections
 jab kharch karne kii seemachunaav ayogne tay kar rakhi he to us hisaab se paisa bhi milanaa chahie
 Otherwise, the commission is impacting the spirit of free and fair elections
 ayog ne 24 janvari ko rigerv bank ko chitthee likhakar har ek ummidavaar ke liye nakad nikasi kisimabadhane kii baat kahi thi
 Five days after this letter, the Reserve Bank set aside the Commission's plea that cash withdrawal is not a mandatory condition for free and fair elections

 2015 main vitt mantri ke rup main arun jetali ne kaha tha ki aane vaale chaar saal main korporate tex 30 pratishat se ghataakar 25 kar diya jayega
 He is done
 pehle companiyon ko 34 pratishat se adhik tex dene padate the ab 25 pratishat hi dene honge
 FICCI, CII and Bombay Stock Exchange, ASSOCHAM, and Siam, an organization in the automobile sector, have welcomed
 yahaan par divangat arun jetali ke puraane bajet bhaashan kaa zikr zaruri he
 Before today's decision, only 7000 companies were paying more than 30 per cent tax out of 7 lakh companies in India
 baaki sabhi ko 25 pratishat ke daayre main laayaa ja chukaa tha
 In the 2017-18 budget speech, Jaitley said that only 7000 companies with more than 250 crore turnover will be taxed more than 30 percent
 baaki 99 pratishat companiyaan 25 pratishat ke daayre main aa chuki hai
 In the 2016-17 budget, Jaitley had reduced the corporate tax to 25 percent for companies with a turnover of up to 250 crore
 tab kaha tha ki is ghoshnaa se 99 pratishat sookshm, laghu or madhyam str kii companiyon ko iskaa laabh milegaa
 Then Finance Minister Jaitley had said that this would result in a loss of 7000 crores in revenue to the government
 uske baad 2017-18 ke bajet main bhi 50 karod turnover vaali MSME companiyon kaa tex ghataakar 25 pratishat kar diya gaya tha
 In this context, the entire MSME sector had come under 25 percent tax
 99 pratishat sector 25 pratishat ke daayre main aa to gaya lekin sarkaar kii kul kamai main inkaa hissaa bahut kam tha
 So there was not much difference
 bada hissaa to us 1 fisadi korporate se aata tha jise aaj 25 pratishat ke daayre main laayaa gaya he
 It is another matter that even after three years of giving 25% corporate tax benefit to msmes, there is no special result

 The US military and intelligence agencies were following the messenger whom Osama trusted heavily and used it to communicate with the outside world

 The New York Times said that CIA analysts analyzed images from the satellite in August and September of 2010 to find out who was staying on the campus

 US officials came to know through intelligence reports that the building, built in 2005, had neither a telephone nor an Internet connection, and the occupants burned it in safety rather than throwing it out
 samachar patr ne kaha ki america adhikariyon kaa maananaa tha ki parisar kaa nirmaan vishesh rup se osama ke chhipane ke liye kiya gaya he
 After collecting reliable information, American detectives came to the conclusion that Osama was actually hiding there
 iske baad america raashtrapati baraak obama ne uske khilaaf abhiyaan shuru karne ko manjuuri de di

 Osama and three other people were dead when the shootings stopped
 america adhikariyon ne osama ke shav ko samudr main dafan kar diya

 adhikariyon ne yah nahin bataaya ki alqaida sargana ko kis sthaan par dafan kiya gaya
 The US did not inform its ally Pakistan about this campaign, it was done to keep this operation completely secret

 com / zbi6uiqnha Superstar Aamir Khan is not averse to working with Shahrukh Khan
 yahaan tak kii aamir, salmaan ke saath bhi kaam kar sakate hai, basharte unke koi aisi film or aisa kirdaar aae, jisamen vah shahrukh yaa salmaan ke saath kaam kar saken
 In fact, Farah Khan had said that God could not gather Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir together in a film
 is par aamir ne kaha, "hamane kab manaa kiya he shahrukh yaa salmaan ke saath kaam karne se
 If a film comes in which all three of us can work, then i will definitely work with Shahrukh and Salman
 " There have been no reports of good relations between Aamir and Shah Rukh in the last few years
 aamir or shahrukh ne kabhi bhi ek-duusare ke saath kaam nahin kiya he
 Yes, Shah Rukh and Salman have worked in films like Karan Arjun, 'kuch Kuch Hota Hota' and 'hum Tumhare Hain Sanam' before the quarrel
 aamir or salmaan bhi ek-duusare ke saath film 'andaaz apana apana' main screen share kar chuke hai, lekin yah baat kaaphi puraani he
 After becoming a superstar, the three have not worked with each other
 vaise bhi aamir or salmaan main dosti he
 The two promote each other's films in their own way
 magar aamir or shahrukh main 'cold war' aksar najar aata rahata he
 In such a situation, perhaps a big filmmaker will try to bring the three together by this statement of Aamir, but before that it will be necessary to know the opinion of Shahrukh, whether he would like to work with Aamir and Salman? desh ke pehle grahamantri sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii sabase oonchi murti stachu of unity kaa buudhvaar ko anaavaran ho gaya

 The Congress president tweeted, "it is okay to unveil the statue of Sardar Patel, but the institutions he has built are being destroyed
" desh ke sansthaanon ko is prakaar nasht kiya janaa kisi rajdroh se kam nahin he
 '' Rahul also used # statueofunity with this tweet
 congress ne lagaaya viraasat hathiyaane kaa aaropagauratlab he ki congress lagaataar pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhartiya janata party par congress kii viraasat ko hathiyaane kaa aarope lagaati rahi he
 Even before the statue was unveiled on Wednesday, Congress leader Anand Sharma accused the Modi government that Patel was a big Congress leader, now the BJP is trying to make him his own
 rahul ne subah hi kiya yadabta den ki ajsardaar patelki jayanti bhi he, to vahiin indira gandhi kii punyatithi bhi he
 Rahul tweeted on Wednesday morning remembering Sardar Patel
 rahul ne likhaa tha ki sardaar patel ek deshbhakt the, jinhone aaazaad, ekajute or secular bharat kii kalpana kii
 He wrote that Sardar Patel was a Congressman who did not tolerate communalism
 modi ne kiya congress par hamalabta den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne murti kaa anaavaran karne ke baad bina naam liye congress par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 PM Modi said that there are some people in the country who are seeing this movement through the prism of politics, we are criticized for praising the sons of the country
 jaise hamane koi bahut bada aparaadh kar diya ho, hamaari koshish he ki bharat ke har rajya ko sardaar patel ke vijan ko aage badhaane main koshish kerani chahie

 Chennai Super Kings won the third Indian Premier League title by defeating Mumbai Indians by 22 runs in a volatile final

 Mumbai's Taranhar Kieron Pollard, who landed at the crease in the 18th over, was able to score 27 runs off 10 balls, putting his score to 146 for nine
 chennai kaa yah doosraa final tha lekin vah pehali baar champion bana

 Tendulkar hit a four in the next over of r Ashwin and scored ten runs in the fifth over with Abhishek Nair (27) off the same off-spinner
 unhone albi morkal kaa swaagat do chaukon se kiya lekin iske baad 22 gend tak koi boundry nahin padi
 Nair broke the order with two consecutive sixes off Shadab Jakati in the tenth over, but even after the half-over was completed, Mumbai's score was reduced to 58 for one wicket
 raina kaa aaj bhagya saath de rahaa tha or dhoni ne yah bhaanpakar unhen gend thamane main der nahin lagaayi
 In his first over, Nair and Harbhajan Singh (1), who were sent to bat in the upper order, were dismissed
 ab jakaati kii baari thi jinhone 15wein over main tendulkar ko seemaa rekha par vijay ke haathon kaich karwaane ke baad saurabh tiwari ko khaataa khole bina pavilion kii raah dikhaa di
 Even after this, Mumbai did not field bighit Pollard and sent JP Duminy (6) who became the victim of economical bowler Muttiah Muralitharan
 pollard jab krij par utre to mumbai ko 18 gend par 55 ran kii jarurat thi
 Pollard scored 22 sixes in the 18th over with two sixes and the same number of fours but in the next over, Ambati Rayudu (21) and Pollard were both dismissed and Chennai's victory was a formality

 Thereafter a dharna program will be organized at every district headquarters on December 28, Lalu, who like his ally Janata Dal United leader Nitish Kumar, was supporting the campaign against demonetisation and black money, but he is alleged that now days It is understood later that the Modi government is saving the capitalists on the pretext of demonetisation
 lalu ne kaha ki notebandi ke baad bade-bade udyogpatiyon ke kaala dhan ko safed kiya gaya, jabaki garib kaa paisa jamaa karakar kangaal ho rahe bainkon ko sarkaar bachaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Lalu also invited economist Mohan Guruswami from Delhi to address the party leaders on the issue of demonetisation at this meeting, who read a detailed four-page article in Hindi on the issue
 lalu ne janata ke bich jane se pehle party kaaryakarta ko nae naare jaise puunjipatiyon ko bachaana hai or notebandi kya laayaa hai, haahaakaar machaaya hai
 Although during the meeting and after the meeting, Lalu Yadav claimed that Nitish Kumar was with him in this campaign, but many leaders of his party targeted Nitish Kumar
 khaskar vidhayak bhai virender ne, jinhone ek baar phir party ke netaa or kaaryakartaaon kii nazarandaaji kaa mudda uthaaya
 Bhai Virender alleged that officers of the same caste are posted in most of the districts
 tippaniyan However, Lalu Yadav later said that it is his compulsion to announce the agitation on the issue of demonetisation, because he cannot leave the public, but knowing that Lalu will try that Nitish will take a slight softening in his current stand on this issue
 And be aggressive
 nitish ne saafe kar diya he ki wo filhal 30 disambar tak is mudde par intjaar karenge, lekin unka bhi maananaa he ki centre sarkaar ko is mudde par jitani taiyaari kerani chahie thi, uskaa abhaav he
 However, Lalu Yadav in Saturday's meeting had initially said in his address that after demonetisation, BJP will face the same fate as the Congress party in the 1977 election after sterilization
 jo nishchit rup se congress ke netaaon ko acha nahin laga hoga
 After Nitish Kumar's support to the Modi government over demonetisation, there was a sour relationship between Congress and Lalu Yadav, but at present it is not decided what the Congress party shows on Lalu Yadav's call for a rally on this issue

 Lalu has created a cry for the party worker to save the new slogans like capitalists and brought demonetisation before going public
 haalanki baithak ke dauraan or baithak ke baad lalu yadav ne daawa kiya ki nitish kumaar is muhim main unke saath hai, lekin unki party ke kai netaaon ne nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Especially MLA Bhai Virender, who once again raised the issue of ignoring the leaders and activists of the party
 bhai virender kaa aarope tha kii ek hi jati ke adhikari adhikansh zile main padasthapit hai
 The comments haalanki lalu yadav ne baad main kaha ki notebandi ke mudde par andolan kii ghoshnaa karnaa unki majaburi he, kyonki janata ko wo chhod nahin sakate, lekin jaanakar maanate hai ki lalu kii koshish hogi ki nitish apane vartmaan rukh main thodi narmi lete hue is mudde par or aakraamak hon
 Nitish has made it clear that he will wait till December 30 on this issue, but he also believes that the central government lacks the amount of preparation it should have done on the issue
 haalanki shanivaar kii baithak main lalu yadav ne shuruuaat main apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki notebandi ke baad bijepi kaa vahi hashr hoga, jo nasbandi ke baad 1977 ke chunaav main congress party kaa hua tha
 Which certainly would not have pleased the Congress leaders
 notebandi par nitish kumaar ke modi sarkaar ko samarthan ke baad congress or lalu yadav ke sambandhon main ai khatas kaam hui thi, lekin filhal tay nahin he ki congress party lalu yadav ke is mudde par ek raily ke aahvaan par kya rukh dikhaati hai

 But they were not in a position to do anything about it
 panvar shikariyon par nakel kasne vaale camp ko bhi suchit nahin kar sakate the kyonki unka vaakitoki kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 The solar powered charger was rendered useless due to continuous rains
 kharaab mausam ke chalate panvar ke liye camp tak pahunchnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Panwar's team often faced such problems
 saura urja se chalane vaale lampon ke charge na hone ke kaaran raat ke samay gasht karnaa bhi mushkil bharaa kaam siddh hota tha
 One of the main reasons for not charging is the rain in this area for three to four months
 paristhitiyon main us samay bada badlaav aayaa jab panvar ne bangaloru kii rinuable energy aplications and products company se sampark saadhaa
 The company introduced a cycling charger, which can not only charge walkie-talkies but also illuminate parks
 cycle ke pichley pahiye main dianemo laga hua he jo pedal maarane par upkaran ko charge kar detaa he
 If the cycle paddle is run for 20 minutes, when the walkie talkie gets an hour of talk, then the bulb illuminating the road can burn for two to three hours
 ab adhikariyon ne ati vrishti vaale ilaakon main 10 vaakitoki de die hai
 The walking patrol of the Dandeli Anshi tiger reserve spread over an area of about 1,050 sq km is very difficult
 panvar kaa kahana he, ‘yahaan tak ki jab apat sthiti nahin hoti thi or hamen medical aapurti yaa rashan ke liye kol kerani hoti thi, tab bhi ham funs jate the
 'due to the reserve area of tiger, black leopard, elephant and other animals, contact system is the most important weapon here
 paanch saal pehle jab aakhri baar yahaan baaghon kii ginati ke kaam ko anjaam diya gaya tha to usamen baaghon kii sankhya 33 bataai gai thi
 After eco-friendly bicycle chargers, the Forest Department is now replacing CFL lamps with LED lamps, which only consume half the electricity than before
 pichley kaaphi maheene se chal rahaa cycle charger kaa prayog ab anya parkon ke adhikariyon main bhi ruchi jagaa rahaa he
 Panwar says that the Nagarhole National Park near Mysore is also showing considerable interest in such a device
 unhone media se kaha ki agar netritv kaushal dikhaaya gaya to yah sambhav he kyonki karnataka vidhansabha main hamaare paas milakar bahumat he
 (from input language) jis teji se vittiya lenden karne ke maamle main sugamawa bad rahi he, usee teji se inako lekar frod hone ke naye-naye tareeke bhi dhokhadhadi karne vaale apana rahe hai
 One such fraud has come up in the last days, in which some people call you as your friend-relative and tell themselves to be in trouble
 ye he tareekadarasal dhokhadhadi karne vaale aapako anjaan number se kol karte hai
 During this time, he talks to you as if he knew you very well
 vah aapke kisi rishtedaar yaa dost kaa naam lekar aapako vishwaas main le lete hai
 After this, he tells himself to get stuck in trouble and asks you to send some money
 yahaan ve log puraa dhyaan rakhte hai ki aapke shaq na ho
 Therefore small amount is demanded from you and gradually this amount increases
 rakhen is baat kaa dhyaan:jab bhi aapako kisi anjaan number se aisa kol aae, jisamen koi shaks aapkaa dost yaa rishtedaar hone kii baat kah rahaa he or aap se paise maang rahaa he, to satark ho jaaen
 Even if you feel that it is your friend after listening to the voice of the person in front, there is nothing wrong in confirming it
 rahen satark :conform karne ke liye aap apane dost yaa rishtedaar ke personal number par kol kar sakate hai
 By calling this number, you can find out whether they have made the call or not
 is str par satarkta baratane ke liye jo sambhav ho, vah kadam jarur uthaaen
 Take necessary steps: If ever you are fraudulent with you, then you must take some steps
 frod kaa pataa chalate hi sabase pehle isaki jaankaree police ko den
 Along with this, inform your bank and related financial institution also
 taaki aapkaa nuksaan zyada na ho or dhokhadhadi karne waalon ke khilaaf samay rahete sahi ection liya ja sake

 jeeyo phone launch ke baad se ab tak reliance jeeyo surkhiyon main nahin he
 The reason is that people have booked the phone, but its delivery has not started
 company ne pehle kaha tha ki isaki shipping sitambar ke pehle yaa duusare hafte se shuru hogi
 But now September is about to end and the delivery of the phone has not started
 philhal jeeyo phone kisi bhi retailor ke paas bhi nahin aayaa he
 We have spoken to some retailers, they have told that at the moment they do not even know when the delivery of Jio phone will start
 retaillers ne yah bhi bataaya he ki customers jinhone phone book karaayaa he wo lagaataar puch rahe hai ki phone kab aayega
 It is worth noting that pre-orders for jiophone started from 24 August and its booking was stopped within a week
 philhal ummid ye he ki jiophone kii delivery 1 october se shuru kii ja sakati he
 In the last few reports, it was said that it will be delivered during Navratri, but now it does not seem so
 haalanki jeeyo ne aadhikarik taur par pehle bhi yah nahin bataaya he ki isaki delivery kab hogi, lekin itnaa kaha gaya ki ise 24 sitambar tak deliver kar diya jayega
 At the time of jiophone launch, it was said that this phone will be available on a first come first served basis
 retail stores par bhi jinhone pehle book kiya he use pehle milegaa
 When will pre-orders for jiophone start again? 10 lakh se zyada logon ne pehle hi iske liye register karaae hai
 The company has said that pre-booking for Jio phone will start soon
 haalanki kuch retaillers ne kaha he ki philhal to jaldi isaki pre booking shuru nahin hogi
 Re-booking will also depend on when the delivery of Jio phone starts
 agar october kii shuruyaat main phone kii delivery hui october ke aakhir tak phir se booking shuru hogi
 Voice call with Jio phone will get free voice call with Jio phone, but to run internet, you will have to recharge Rs 153
 mukesh ambani ne kaha ki jeeyo phone ke saath wais kol hameshaa free hogi, lekin isaki sharten abhi nahin bataai gai hai
 Because even when Jio Sim was announced, it was said that calling will always be free
 lekin agar kisi ne 3 maheene tak richarge nahin karaayaa to kol block ho jaati he
 Mukesh Ambani said that Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan plan will be available for Jio phone with just Rs 153 per month
 khaas baat yah he ki iske liye koi fere yuses policy (FUP) nahin he
 That is, there will be no 2GB limit in a day and unlimited data will be available

 vivies lakshmana ko antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kahe hue paanch maheene biit gaye, lekin is diggaj ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki vah ab bhi test praaroop main khilne ke liye feet hai
 When asked about his preference for Laxman, he said, maybe i would like to play in white clothes
 bhartiya ballebaaj jab team ko lagaataar niraash kar rahe hai, tab lakshmana ke paas unke liye salaah he
 This former Indian batsman said, it is just a matter of turning a good start into a big score
 jab bhi koi ballebaaj acchhee shuruyaat ko badi pari main badalata he or anya ballebaaj uske saath khelte hai, to aap saamanyat: acha score bana lete hai
 The figures may not be in Laxman's favor, but he said that after the 2011 World Cup victory, the Indian team did not perform as poorly in limited-overs matches
 lakshmana ne ek prachaar kaarykram ke itar kaha, mujhe lagata he ki in do maichon (pakistan ke khilaaf maujuuda shrunkhlaa ke) ke alaava ekadivasiy praaroop main hamane acha pradarshan kiya he
 i think we had a good performance after the World Cup and we played well in T20 as well
 tippaniyan Laxman said, we could not qualify in the T20 World Cup knockout
 hamane chaar match khele or ek main buree tarah haar gaye or kwalifai nahin kar paae
 "overall we did well in T20 and ODI cricket," he said
 pakistan ke haathon haar par lakshmana ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki in do maichon main pakistan ke gendbaajon ko shrey diya janaa chahie
 He has three aggressive fast bowlers in the form of Junaid, Irfan and Umar Gul
 unhone kaha, maine kolkata main match dekha or junayd tathaa irfan ne chennai kii tarah hi tufaani gendbaaji kii
 So i think the Pakistani bowling attack is very strong
 apane sanyas ke bare main lakshmana ne kaha, maine bharat kii ore se acha pradarshan kiya
 There is a time you have to move forward and i feel that after playing 16 years it was the right time for me

 aankade bhale hi lakshmana ke paksh main nahin hon, lekin unhone kaha ki 2011 main vishwacap jeet ke baad bhartiya team ne simit overon ke maichon main utana kharaab pradarshan nahin kiya
 "I think we have done well in the ODI format apart from these two matches (of the current series against Pakistan)," Laxman said on the sidelines of a promotional event
 mujhe lagata he ki vishwacap ke baad hamaara pradarshan thik rahaa or tii-20 main bhi ham acha khele
 The comments lakshmana ne kaha, ham tii-20 vishwacap ke nokout main kwalifai nahin kar paae
 We played four matches and lost badly in one and could not qualify
 unhone kaha, kul milakar tii-20 or ekadivasiy cricket main hamane acha pradarshan kiya
 On the defeat at the hands of Pakistan, Laxman said, "I think Pakistan's bowlers should be given credit in these two matches
" unke paas junayd, irfan or umr gul ke rup main teen aakraamak tej gendbaaj hai
 He said, i saw the match in Kolkata and Junaid and Irfan bowled the storm like Chennai
 isliye mujhe lagata he ki pakistani gendbaaji akraman kaaphi majboot he
 On his retirement, Laxman said, "I did well for India
" ek samay aapako aage badhanaa hota he or mujhe lagata he ki 16 saal khilne ke baad vah mere liye sahi samay tha
 Laxman said, we could not qualify in the T20 World Cup knockout
 hamane chaar match khele or ek main buree tarah haar gaye or kwalifai nahin kar paae

 Former Australia's World Champion Captain Michael Clarke believes that the Australian spirit is seen inside Team India captain Virat Kohli and the people of Australia love him a lot
 maaikel clark ne pune main yojit ek kaarykram main kaha ki viraat kohli kaa australian darshak behad sammaan karte hai
 Virat's aggressive style is often viewed from the wrong perspective
 clark ne kaha, ‘main is baat ko maanane se inkaar karata hum ki viraat kohli ke australia main phens nahin hai
 i think Australia is filled with a lot of passion inside Virat
 viraat behad hi aakraamak cricket khelte hai, wo maidan par kaaphi jununee dikhte hai, lekin maidan ke baahar wo utane hi shaleen or shant hai
 i do not remember any Australian cricketer who is not like Virat
 viraat kohli ko australian media kii ore se nishaanaa banane par clark ne kaha, aapako australian media main viraat virdohi hi chijen dekhne ko milti hai
 He wants to write against Virat itself but i know how much Virat is respected in Australia
 aapako bataa den ki maaikel clark ke alaava mike hasi ne bhi viraat kohli kii jamkar tarif kii thi
 He described Virat Kohli as a Ponting-like captain
 hasi ne kaha tha, ‘kohli shandaar hai
 i like his captaincy
 main unke aakraamak andaaj or jeet kii lalak kaa prashansak hum
 They keep trying to take the team as far as possible
 jeet ko lekar unki bhukh purv australian captain riki ponting kii tarah hai

 Before Shivratri, there has been a big update on the news of infiltration of 10 terrorists from Pakistan in Gujarat
 grih mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik suraksha agenciyon ne inamen se teen aatankiyon ko maar giraaya he, jabaki baaki saat kii lokation tres kar lee gai he

 bhrashtachar ke aaropon se ghire aam aadmi party ke sadsy kumaar vishwaas ne kaha he ki agar vah doshi paae gaye to party or usase judi sabhi samitiyon se istipha de denge
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, he dismissed the allegations against him outright
 'mere pie ne kavi sammelan ke paise liye or raseed di'kumaar vishwaas ne daawa kiya ki sting oparation karwaane vaale media sarkaar ke anuranjan jha unke mitra hai
 He told, 'they often come to my house with family
 anuranjan jha kaa betaa mere pair choota he
 The same happened on that day
 vah aayaa or bolaa ki uski parichit aaengi, unhen kavi sammelan karana he
 The next day she came
 maine saadhaaran mudra main unase baat kii
 He said many times that Shagun has money, touch it
 maine kaha main paise nahin luungaa
 You talk to the PA
 haa mere pie ne paise liye hai or bakaayade letters had par likhakar raseed di he
 "taking cash money is a crime" Kumar Vishwas also showed the receipt given to the letter head
 unhone kaha ki sting oparation karne vaala channel kya yah kahana chahta he ki is desh main cash liya gaya paisa blikemani he
 Believing himself to be clean, Vishwas said that he has always been giving proper taxes on income
 unhone bataaya ki pichhali baar unhone 11 lakh rupaya tex diya tha or is baar bhi kareeb 15 lakh kaa tex denge
 He said that he takes his fees for the Kavi Sammelan both by cash and check and if it is a crime in this country, then tell me, i will retire from public life today
 siddhu kii tarah 'thoko tali' nahin kah saktakumar vishwaas ne bijepi saansad or purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi ghaseet liya
 He said, 'I am not Navjot Singh Sidhu who leave his parliamentary constituency in Amritsar and keep saying' thoko tali 'in any comedy show
 main kavi hum, paise kamata hum, apni pratibha se kamata hum
 But i am not like those poets who correct the spelling of Sonia Gandhi's speech
 main bijness class main safar karata hum to ramlila maidan main jaakar danda bhi khaataa hum
 'entry is in the account, if you want to check the money, Kumar Vishwas said that the money has not been hidden from anyone
 acount main charted acount ne entry kii he
 Our party has formed a two-member committee comprising Sanjay Singh and Yogendra Yadav
 karpshan se ham koi samjhauta nahin karenge
 Kumar Vishwas said that we have asked for raw footage from Anuranjan Jha and he has promised to deliver it in 24 hours
 lekin ab tak nahin di
 If Anuranjan gives the raw footage, then i am ready to put it on youtube and put it in front of the country
 agar isamen koi galati pai gai to main aam aadmi party or usase sambandhit sabhi samitiyon se istipha dene or ek aam aadmi kii tarah sadak par party kaa sahyog karne ko taiyaar hum
 i grew up in a Hindu family
 hamaare ghar main hameshaa ek puujaghar hua karata tha, jahaan almaari or deevaaron par devi-devataaon ke chitra or painting divangat purvajon kii feeki padati tasveeron ke saath chaspaan rahete the or un par mere shraddhalu mata-pita kii roj jalaai agarbattiyon kii bikhri hui raakh ke nishaan pade hote the
 i have already written about how my early experiences of piety met me watching my father pray
 mere pita har subah snaan ke baad tauliya lapetakar puja ghar ke saamne khadey ho jate, unke geele bal ab bhi ankadhe hote, or sanskrit ke mantron kaa ucchar karte
 But he never pleaded to let me join you, he was a living example of the Hindu view that religion is a very personal matter that prayer would be between you and whatever image of your father you choose to worship
 is
 hindu paddati ke mutabik mujhe apana satya khud khojna tha
 i think i have discovered
 main aastik hum, schuli dinon kii naastikta ke ek chote-se daur ke baavjood (us kism kii naastikta jo tark or vivek kii khoj ke saath aati he or uski simaaon kii sweekaarokti ke saath chali jaati he)
 And i am happy to call myself a believer Hindu: not only because it is the faith in which i was born, but also for many other reasons, although the faith does not need any argument
 ek vajah to saanskrithik haih bataur hindu meraa naata us dharm se hai jo mere apane logon kii pracheen medha or kushaagratha ko vyakt karata he
 i am proud of the history of my religion, on my land: on the countryside of Adi Shankaracharya, who traveled from the southernmost tip of the country to Kashmir in the north, Gujarat in the west and Odisha in the east, with spiritual scholars everywhere
 Preached his beliefs and established monasteries
 purvajon ke prati meri is nishtha kii tasdik harvard kii adhyeta dyna ek ne 'anginat tirthayatraaon kii pagarhndiyon se ek saath guntha' bharat kaa 'pavitra bhugol' likhte hue kii he
 The great philosopher-president of India, Dr
 sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne hinduon ko 'saajha itihaas, saajha sahitya or saajha sabhyataa se judi ek vishisht saanskrithik ikai' bataaya
 Reiterating my allegiance to Hinduism, i am presenting my claim on this geography and history, its literature and civilization, identifying myself as the heir (one of the billions heirs) of that revered tradition, the past
 i go back to ancient times
 main puri tarah sweekaar karata hum ki mere kai dost, hamawatan or saathi-hindu aisi koi jarurat mahasoos nahin karte or aise hindu bhi hai jo hindustani nahin hai (yaa nahin rah gaye hai), lekin main is 'saanskriti' or 'bhugolic' hindu dharm se saath sahaj hum, jo mujhe apane purvajon ke ateet ke saath baandhta he
 But the second reason for my belief in Hinduism, in the absence of a better word, is intellectually 'fit': i am more comfortable with the principles of any other religion than i am, rather than the religion of Hinduism
 - i am more comfortable with principles
 main lambey vakt se khud ko udaar yaa aaazaad khyaal maanata aa rahaa hum, is lafj ke mahaj siyaasi myne main hi nahin, yaa arthshaastron ke usulon ke mutallik bhi nahin, balki jindagi ke prati ravaie ke taur par
 It is my natural instinct or natural instinct to accept people as they meet, to allow them to be what they want, to be, and to do what they want (as long as it does not harm others)
 sakht or min-mekh nikaalane vaali manyataayen mere mizaaj ko raas nahin aatin
 In the matter of religion too, i found that my independent Qiyyal spirit was stronger than the religion in which i was raised
 hindu dharm kai myanon main is vichaar kii dhuree par tikaa he ki yugon-yugon kii or devatv kii chirkaalik budhimata kisi ek pavitra granth tak simit nahin ho sakati, hamaare paas kai pavitra granth hai, or khud apana satya (yaa kai satya) hasil karne ke liye ham unamem se harek main gaharaa ghota laga sakate hai
 As a Hindu, i can claim to be a follower of a religion without the priesthood of the Church or the Pope, of a religion whose rituals and customs i am free to reject, of a religion that i am Do not be compelled to demonstrate my faith by visual recognition, by merging my identity into any congregation, nor by saying a certain day or time or frequency of worship Does In
 (yahaan na koi hindu pope he, na koi hindu vatican, na koi hindu prashnottaree, yahaan tak ki koi hindu ravivaar bhi nahin)
 As a Hindu, i follow a religion that allows rituals and practices to honor (or not to), rituals to follow (or not believe in) options for worship and worship to the worshipers of divinity
 , Features a bouquet for fasts to keep (or not to keep)
 bataur hindu main us panth main vishwaas karata hum jo dharmagranth kii pratibandhkari rudhipoon se mukt he, aisa panth jo pavitra ilham ke ek hi granth kii bedicaon main bandhane se inkaar karata he
 And while i am paradoxically registering the 'reasons' for my faith in a religion beyond comprehension, let me mention the firm argument: Being a Hindu, above all, i belong to the only major religion in the world which is the only one Does not claim to be true religion
 mujhe yah baat behad anukool or sukhad lagati he ki main duusare dharmon ke apane saathi inasaanon kaa saamana is bhitari vishwaas ke boj se dabe bagaiyr kar saktaa hum ki main ek 'sachche maarg' par hum jisase ve chook gaye hai
 This orthodox doctrine lies at the core of 'semitic (or Semitic) religions' — Christianity, Islam, and Judaism
 bible kahata he, ''main hi maarg, satya or jivan hum, koi bhi manushya pita (ishwar) ke najadik nahin aata, lekin keval mere marfat (jon 14:6)'', quran elaan karata he, ''koi bhagwaan nahin, keval allaah he or mohammad uskaa paigambar he'', or nahin maanane waalon ko mukti kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar kar detaa he, moksh or swarg kii to baat hi chhod den
 Hinduism insists that all paths of faith are justified, and that Hindus happily worship and honor saints of other religions and sacred things
 mujhe garv he ki main apane dharm ko dhokhaa die bagaiyr duusare dharmon kii pavitrataa kaa sammaan kar saktaa hum
 Hinduism Yatra The 'hindu family' of 'sangh Parivar' is made up of what? The ideology that laid the foundation of Savarkar, Golwalkar and Upadhyay gave a very simple principle to the members of the RSS
 yah purvajon se judi is manyata par tikaa he ki hindustan pracheen kaal se hi hinduon kii sarajameen he or unki pahchaan isse abhinn he
 Hindutva advocates argue that since ancient times Hindu culture and civilization are the essence of Indian life, Indian nationalism is therefore Hindu nationalism
 hindustan kaa itihaas hinduon ke us sangharsh kii kahani he jo unhone videshi aakrantaon ke hamalon se apane dharm or samskruti kii raksha or hifaazat ke liye kiya tha
 It is true that non-hindus are also inhabited by the territory of India, but whether they are invaders (muslims, Christians) or guests (jews, Parsis), they can be tolerated, which depends on their loyalty to this land
 , But cannot be considered equal to Hindus unless they accept the superiority of Hindus in India and adopt Hindu traditions and culture
 gaiyr-hinduon ko sweekaar karnaa hi hoga ki unke purvaj hindu the, yaa or behatar hoga ki ve apni asli saanskrithik jadon kii ore lautate hue dharm badalakar hindu dharm apana len
 This theory further states that the political forces of India opposing the ideology of the Sangh are wrong, because they make the mistake of recognizing 'national unity' as the unity of all the people who are living on the land of coincidence, then Regardless of their religion or country of origin
 aise log asal main rashtriyata-virdohi hai, kyonki unki asal prerana raashtra ke bahusnkhyakon ke hiton kii parvaah karne kii bajaae chunaavon main alpsankhyakon ke vot hasil karne kii khudgarj ichha he
 Therefore unity and mobilization of Hindus is very important
 hindu log dushmano se ghire hue hai, isliye aisa dhruvikaran hona hi chahie jo hinduon ko tamaam duusare logon ke khilaaf khadaa kar de
 However, Hindus have to be united, the absence of unity is the root of all evils that are troubling the Hindus
 sangh parivaar kaa mukhya mishan yahi ekajutata laana or ise hindu raashtra kii zyada mahaan kirti tak le janaa he
 This theory is simple and clear, but the problem with it is that it refuses to accept the reality of the total bottom line of Hinduism
 aresas ke vaicharik pravaktaa thik unheen chizon ko isaki kamajori ke taur par dekhte hai: iskaa tamaam darshanon or vividhta ko gaiyr-maamuli dhang se grahan karnaa, tamaam kism kii manyataon or prathaon ko iskaa sweekaar karnaa, kisi ek pavitra granth ke rudh siddhanton tak khud ko simit rakhane se iskaa inkaar karnaa, iskaa lagaataar pravaahit hote rahanaa, ise ekarup 'semitic' yaa sami panth ke taur par paribhaashit karnaa naammumkin hona—jise swami vivekanand ne hindu dharm kii takat ke taur par dekha
 The federalist pursuit of polarization and unity also entails the desire to make Hinduism all that it is not, to 'semitize' it, so that it looks like the religions of the 'invaders' —the religion bound by code and orthodox principles, One with a recognizable god (possibly Rama), a head sacred scripture (gita)
 yah hinduon kii vishaal bahusankhya kaa jeeta-jaagta hindu dharm nahin he
 This raises the obvious question: should every believer Hindu be considered a believer in the Hindutva project? Being a Hindu believer in my Hindu religion, i cannot agree with the Hindutvaists
 main us sabase vaaki sharminda hum jo ve mere dharm ke naam par karne kaa daawa karte hue kar rahe hai
 The violence is particularly gruesome: it has led to hundreds of thousands of Hindus protesting across India with placards in their hands and saying 'not in my name' (not in my name)
 maine is kitaab main shuru se aakhir tak bataaya he ki maine hameshaa apane ek aise dharm se jude hone par garv kiya he, jo vishwaason kii ascharyajanak vividhta or vistaar se vabsta he, ek aisa dharm jo ishwar kii upasna ke sabhi tareekon ko jaij maanata he—asal main yah duniya kaa akelaa bada dharm he jo ekmaatr sachcha dharm hone kaa daawa nahin karata
 i am often asked: how does a flock of goons be able to reduce the high-rise glory and grandeur of the Vedas and Upanishads into the twisted fanatics of the politics of its kind? Why should any Hindu allow him to convert Hinduism into the raucous self-glorification of football-bearers, turn a religion-tolerant tolerance into a superstitious violent frenzy? His openness, his respect for diversity, all others Hinduism, with its acceptance of religions, is a religion that has always spoken its words without intimidating others
 lekin yah vah hindutv nahin he jisane babari masjid ko nestnabud kiya, na hi yah vah hindutv he jo sampradayik siyasatdanon ke nafrat bhare jubaani hamalon kii shakl main ulichaa gaya he
 Instead, it is the Hindu religion of Swami Vivekananda
 swami vivekanand kii kuch sabase ahm baton kii vyakhya karnaa jaruri or samichin hoga
 The first thing he said was that Hinduism means "both tolerance and universal acceptance
" ham na keval saarvbhaum sahishnutaa main yakeen karte hai, balki ham sabhi dharmon ko sachche dharm ke taur par sweekaar karte hai
 "he has quoted a hymn, which i have already mentioned, which says that just as the currents coming from different places meet in the same ocean, all the way to the same God Carry
 unhone baar-baar advait ke siddhant kii budhimata par jor diya, jo kahata he ki satya ek hi he, phir bhale hi gyani use alag-alag naamon se pukaarte hon
 The essence of Vivekananda's vision is in the theory of Sasarva Dharma Sambhavya: which is a kind of Hinduism which is considered by the vast majority of Hindus, which is in fact accepted by other religions and methods of worship and has long been prized by our culture
 Has been the criterion
 main is dharna ko khaarij karata hum ki nafrat ke harkare tamaam logon kii yaa yahaan tak ki zyaadaatar hinduon kii jubaan bolte hai
 The ideology of Hindutva is actually a harmful distortion of Hinduism
 yah chaunkaane vaali baat he ki libral party or swatantra udhyam samarthak swatantra party sareekhee beesvin sadi kii ab vilupt ho chuki siyaasi partiyon ke netaa apane hindu dharm kii ghoshnaaon main nitant adig the, libral party ke netaa shrinivas shastri ne ramayana par prakand shodhpatr likhe hai or swatantra party ke sansthaapak si
 Rajagopalachari (rajaji) was a Sanskrit scholar whose lines of history and lectures on aspects of Hinduism are still widely read decades after his death
 donon main se koi bhi hindutv kii ashishnutaa or kattarta ko kisi bhi tarah apane priy dharm ke pratinidhi ke taur par nahin pahchaan pate
 Likewise, many leaders of the Congress party are comfortable in their Hindu beliefs, while they reject the political idea of hindutva
 hindutv ke harkaron ke liye yahi bataanaa muafic padataa he ki hindu dharm kii unki ladaaku vyakhya or 'chhadam-secularon' ke ishwarviheen pashchimikaran ke bich main se hi kisi ek ko chunanaa hoga
 Rajaji and Shastri had proved that you can be a politically liberal person even by performing your Hinduism with gazelle
 lekin hindutv ko rajnatik hindu dharm ke saath ekmec karke us vikalp ko khatm kar diya gaya he, kuch is tarah maano aisa ghalmail hi shraddhalu hindu ke saamne maujuud akelaa sambhav vikalp he
 i reject the idea
 main na keval khud ko hindu or udaaravaadi, donon ek saath maanata hum, balki paata hum ki udaarvaad hi vah siyaasi vichaardhaara he jo mere dharm ke atyant vyapak or khuli maansikta vaale swaroop se mail khaati he
 The irony of insecurity is that the renewed claim of Hindutva gives a glimpse of insecurity rather than confidence
 yah apmaan or paraajay kii baar-baar yaad dilaane kii buniyaad par khadaa kiya jaataa he, muslim fatah or hukumat kii gaathaon se ise majboot kiya jaataa he, tode gaye mandiron or luute gaye khajaanon ke kisse-kahaniyon se ise hawa di jaati he
 All this has imprisoned highly sensitive Hindus in the guise of failure and defeat, while they should have been part of a liberal story of a confident religion that is seeking its place in the world
 ateet kii naakaamiyon kii taraf dekhne se bhavishya kii kamyaabiyon ke liye koi ummid nahin jaagti
 This is one of the most prominent voices of contemporary Hindutva in American Dr
 david fraule ne bhi sweekaar kii he
 They are his basic long boring article Arise Arjun! (1995) write that Hindus "generally suffer from a lack of self-esteem and a inferiority complex, because of which they are genuinely afraid to express themselves and their religion
" sadiyon kii videshi hukumat or unke dharmantaran kii ab bhi jari koshishon ne unhen buree tarah tod diya he
 Frawley's answer is for Hindus to reclaim their Hindu pride, but their own discovery of the reasons for the merger raises questions about their prescriptions
 hindu or hindustani hone ke naate main daleel duungaa ki hindustan ke hone kaa kul matlab hi is vichaar ko khaarij kar dene main he ki rashtriyata ko dharm se tay hona chahie
 Our nationalist leaders never fall into the deceitful trap of agreeing that since partition had established a separate nation for Muslims, the nation that survived was for Hindus
 hindustan ke vichaar ko sweekaar karne ke liye aapako us daleel ko thukraana hoga jisane 1947 main desh kaa bantwaaraa kiya tha
 This is the real problem here
 maine upar bhi zikr kiya he, nehru ne aagaah kiya tha ki bahusnkhyakon kii sampradayikta khaas taur par khatarnaak he kyonki yah khud ko rashtrawaad kii shakl main pesh kar sakati he
 i am proud of Hinduism: i do not want to sacrifice its facts to fundamentalists
 main khud ko hindu or rashtravaadi maanata hum, par main hindu rashtravaadi nahin hum
 Discriminating against another on the basis of one's religion, killing another, destroying another's place of worship is not a part of Hinduism, as it was not even part of Swami Vivekananda's religion
 hindu dharm kii in buniyadi baton kii taraf waapas jane kaa yahi vakt he
 This is the time to bring Hinduism back from the clutches of fundamentalists
 hindu dharm ekarupi nahinvakt-vakt par, hindutvvaadi, mujhe us dharm kii yaad dilaate hue jo paidaaish se hi meraa he, mujhase is achche-bhale naare ko jahiraa taur par gaur se sunne kii maang karne lagata haih ''garv se kaho ham hindu hai
 "well then, let's talk about this
" mujhe sachmuch garv he ki main hindu hum
 But what is it that i am proud of and what i am not? i am not proud of my own co-religionists attacking Muslim homes and shops and sabotaging them
 mujhe un hinduon par garv nahin he jo muslim ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar karte hai yaa muslim maanon kii kokh ujaadte hai
 i am not proud of those Hindu vegetarians who roasted humans alive and celebrated their corpses
 mujhe un logon par garv nahin he jo upanishdon kii udaatt aadhibhautik pariklpanaaon ko pahchaan ke khud apane bodh kii tuchchi kattarta main gata dete hai or is pahchaan kaa daawa bhi ve dusron ke bahishkaar ke liye karte hai
 i am proud of those Hindus, like Shankaracharya of Kanchi, who say that Hindus and Muslims should live like Rama and Laxman in India
 mujhe un hinduon par garv nahin he, masalan 'sadhvi' rutambhraa par, jo kahati hai ki musalmaan hindu bharat ke doodh ko dahi main badal dene vaale khattey neembu kii tarah hai
 i am proud of the Hindus who outrightly reject Hindu communalism
 mujhe un hinduon par garv he jo hindu rashtrawaad or bhartiya rashtrawaad ke bich ke fark ko samajhate or uskaa sammaan karte hai
 Apparently, the majority are never seen as 'separatists', because separatism is by definition the only minority
 lekin bahusankhyak sampradayikta asal main pruthakatawaad kaa hi charam rup hai
 i am proud of the Hindus who believe that both saffron and green have equal connection with the Indian flag
 gaiyr-hinduon ko unke hi swadesh main doum darje kii haisiyat main dhakel dene ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa
 For the Hindus like me, the only possible idea of india is the idea of a nation which is much bigger than the total sum of its parts
 yahi vah akelaa hindustan he jo hamen khud ko na brahman, na bengali, na hindu, na hi hindibhashi, balki theth hindustani kehane kii ijaajat degaa
 How will there be another slogan for Hindus like me? Proudly say we are Hindustani
 bataur hindu, meraa naata duniya main us ekmaatr bade dharm se he jo yah daawa nahin karata ki vahi akelaa sachcha dharm he
 Hindus welcome the saints and texts of other religions
 The federalist quest for polarization and uniformity is in fact a desire to make Hinduism what it is not

 com / 0xmpxxt6ss Now how much more evidence does the BJP need? arvind kejariwal par manamaane dhang se party chalaane kaa aarope gaahe bagaahe lagata rahata he, yadi kejariwal ne aam aadmi party ko apni pakad main nahin rakhaa hota to yogendra yadav, prashanth bhushan jaise log abhi bhi party main hote
 It is not new to have a person in political parties
 sabhi partiyaan aise hi chalati hai, lekin aam aadmi party bani thi sabase hatakar isliye logon ko laga tha ki yahaan aantarik loktantr hoga
 But this did not happen
 virodhiyon ko yahaan bhi darwaja dikhaa diya jaataa he
 His words are not heard here either
 masalaa aam aadmi party kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke pehle kaa he
 In this meeting, AAP had called its founding member Shanti Bhushan, but even before the meeting, Shanti Bhushan called AAP a khap, ie where only a handful of people run
 baaki sab kathputli hai
 The National Council of the Aam Aadmi Party has 300 members and the Executive has 24 members
 prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko nikaalane ke baad kaaryakarini main keval 14 sadsy rah gaye hai
 Outside the meeting, some leaders who were expelled from the party continued to shout anti-party slogans and sit on the dharna to protest
 shanti bhushan ne kejariwal mantrimandal main shaamil kuch mantriyon par bhrashtra hone kaa bhi aarope laga diya
 Not only this, you also fired Munish Raizada, who lives in Chicago
 rayjada ne kejariwal ko niteesha kumaar kaa samarthan dene kaa bhi virodh kiya tha
 He also called Lalu Yadav a criminal
 rayjada dilli ke swasthji mantri satendra jain ke salaahkaar bhi the
 The comments abhi tak aam aadmi party ne shanti bhushan, yogendra yadav, anant kumaar ko party se nikaal chuki he jabaki saansad dharmaveer gandhi or harinder singh khalsa ko nilambit kar chuki he
 Apparently AAP leaders have gone to bed with these allegations
 magar vipaksh ko ek mudda jarur mil gaya he
 Kejriwal should understand that calling politics good and bad before not joining politics, accusing parties of running in a Hitlerist manner is all right, but when it comes to itself, it becomes clear that politics is a soot There are closets where it is very difficult to avoid stains
 rajnatik dalon main ek vyakti kii pakad hona koi nai baat nahin he
 All parties run like this, but the Aam Aadmi Party was formed, but most people thought that there would be internal democracy here
 magar aisa hua nahin
 Opponents are also shown the door here
 unki baat yahaan bhi nahin suni jaati
 The issue preceded the Aam Aadmi Party's National Council meeting
 is baithak main aap ne apane sansthaapak sadsy shanti bhushan ko bulaayaa tha, magar baithak ke pehle hi shanti bhushan ne aap ko khap qaraar de diya yani jahaan par mutthibhar logon kii hi chalati he
 The rest are puppets
 aam aadmi party kii rashtriya parishad main 300 sadsy hai or kaaryakarini main 24
 After the removal of Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav, there are only 14 members in the executive
 baithak ke baahar kuch netaa jinhen party se nikaal diya gaya ve party virdohi naare lagaate rahe or dharne par baithkar apana virodh jataate rahe
 Shanti Bhushan also accused some ministers in the Kejriwal cabinet of being corrupt
 yahi nahin aap ne chicago main rahane vaale munish rayjada ko bhi nikaal diya
 Raizada had also opposed Kejriwal's support of Nitish Kumar
 unhone lalu yadav ko bhrashtra apradhi bhi bataaya tha
 Raizada was also an advisor to Delhi Health Minister Satendra Jain
 tippaniyan So far, the Aam Aadmi Party has removed Shanti Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Anant Kumar from the party, while mps Dharamvir Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa have been suspended
 jaahir he aap ke netaa in aaropon se tilamila gaye hai
 But the opposition has definitely found an issue
 kejariwal ko samajhnaa chahie ki raajnneeti main na aane ke pehle raajnneeti ko bhala bura kahana sabhi ko bhrashtra kahana, partiyon par hitalaravaadi dhang se chalaane kaa aarope lagaana, sab sahi he, magar jab baat khud par aati he tab pataa chalata he ki raajnneeti ek kaalikh kii kothri hai jahaan daag se bachanaa bada mushkil he

 Which other party will have so many Dalit mps and mlas? From Ambedkar memorials to the presidency, the BJP left no stone unturned in embodying Dalit identity symbols
 phir bhi dalit samudaay main bhaajapa ke khilaaf gussa khul rahaa he
 The farmer started cramping with the bugle of 2014 elections
 satta main aane ke baad fasal beemaa, khaad kii aapurti, jandhan se lekar karj maafee tak vah sab kuch kiya gaya jo kisaanon ko rajnatik rup se kareeb rakhane ke liye jaruri tha
 But farmers from Gujarat and Maharashtra to Madhya Pradesh are desperate to raise BJP governments head on
 mudra, start ap, skill india, microfinance
 
 
 The youth may not have done well, but the Modi government has tried its best to keep this very sensitive mass base policies at the center, but youth and students in the country are lighting up the torch of revolt against the government
 post truth (jab saarvajanik samaj akatya tathyon par aadhaarit na hokar bhaavnaatmak yaa aasthajanya prachaar se prabhavit hoti he) samay kaa pehla charan netaaon ke naam tha
 They changed public opinion from the factual emotional upsurge to the plank
 lekin kya log ab bhaavana ke kshitij se utar kar sachaai kii jameen par aane lage hai? sarkaar ke chanakya yah nahin samaj paa rahe hai ki jinhen unhone sabase zyada dulaara-puchakaara, ve hi kyon baagi ho chale hai?bhaajapa sarkaron ke virodh main tani dalit, kisaan or yuva (patidaar, maratha, jat, gujars) mutthiyon ko
 The government party is getting wrapped up in the stories of the opposition conspiracy, but this argument suddenly fills the opposition with so much strength that it does not have
 centre se lekar 20 rajyon main bahumat kii takat se las sarkaron ke saamne vipaksh itane saare andolan kaise paidaa kar paa rahaa he?kuch aisi awaajen bhi sunai padati hai ki sarkaar logon tak apni baat nahin pahunchaa paa rahi he
 Keep in mind that this argument is coming from the government, till recently, whose dialogues were raging on laboratories
 is bahuaiami ghaneebhoot virodh kii vajahen kuch duusari hai jo apni bansuri kii besuri dhun main mugdh sarkaron ko shaayad hi sunai den
 The economic divide layer has risen above the layer of ethnic and religious divisions
 pichley kareeb ek dashak kii mandi ne bhartiya samaaj ko aarthik rup se surakshit or asurikshat virgon main baant diya he
 Government employees, private employment, medium businessmen, big industrialists, pensioners are in the first category
 mandi se inkaa kaarobaar va kamai bhale hi na badi ho lekin unka kaam chal rahaa he
 Their organized influence is reflected in the pay commission or GST concessions
 kisaan or berozegaar yuva asurakshit aarthik tabake kaa hissaa hai, nai sarkaar banane ke baad jinaki dushwariyaan kai guna badi hai
 For example, the telecom industry, which has brought in the most new jobs in the last decade, has lost about 50,000 jobs since 2015
 lagbhag itane hi log 2018 main bekaar ho jaaenge
 It is the farmers' trouble that has made the government head on the support price
 saamaajik arthshaastra bataata he ki mandi hameshaa sabase pehle sabase nichle tabake ko maarthi he or growth sabase pehle sabase oonche tabake ko falti he
 Demonetisation and GST were the first jobs of unskilled people
 jaateey dhaanche main jo sabase neeche hai, aarthik kram main bhi unki vahi jagah he
 Therefore, the pain of economic hopelessness is spreading in the anger of ethnic identities
 raajnneeti main pratikwaad bad rahaa he
 In the last three-four years, the central and state governments of the BJP have left no stone unturned in brightening the symbols of Dalit, Youth and Farmers
 ambedkar ke naam par itnaa adhik prachaar kabhi nahin hua hoga
 Symbolism over a threshold becomes a political risk to governance
 jameen par jab sthitiyaan vipareet hon or badlaav na dikhe to pratikon ko chamakaana chidh paidaa karata he
 The over-hype and zero change of BJP governments is causing annoyance and outrage
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki is baar andolanon kaa charitra badla hua he
 Nothing is being sought from the government, but to protect the right to fight
 daliton, kisaanon or yuvaaon ko yah mahasoos ho rahaa he ki jo unhen mila tha, use bhi chhina ja saktaa he
 Therefore, governments have to repeatedly ask for the status quo
 yah mohabhang he yaa sarkaron par avishvaas, lekin jo bhi he, behad khatarnaak he
 *** ikkisvin sadi main bhi nari man ko abhivyakt karne vaali das shreshth kahaniyon main urmila shiris kii kahani 'cheekh' bhi shumaar he
 It can also be told by the author's representative story, in which he exposes the soft fibers of the female mind under the condolences of a rape victim as well as the condolences of her family, society, parents, brothers, neighbors and friends
 She has been successful in instilling that courage where she dares to stand up despite this accident
 sahitya ajtak kii ore se lekhika urmila shiris kii kahani 'cheekh' unako, or unke prashansak pathakon ke liye shubhakamana swarupahkahaneh cheekh- urmila shirinjab ladki ko hosh aayaa to vahaan koi bhi nahin tha
 There was a black silence shade
 machharon kii bhinbhinaahat tathaa nami kii gandh kamare main vyaapt thi
 The rain had stopped outside, but the loud sounds of water flowing and the heat were going on continuously
 sadak par logon kaa aana-janaa shuru ho gaya tha
 He rubbed his eyes
 
 
 so rahi hoon yaa jaag rahi hoon
 
 
 Nothing was understood until the moment
 kisi or duniya kaa rahasyavrut aasapaas tehra hua laga
 
 
 Then, seeing the jeans slipping under the feet, there was a electric shock
 usne man-mastishk ko
 
 
 Tap your limbs
 haath se sahalaaya
 
 
 Scratch it
 
 
 nakhun or daanton ke nishaan ubhar aaye the
 
 
 The sharp edge of the pain broke out, like a sharp green beak in a soft green branch
 vah cheekh padi jor se
 
 
 No

 That can not be
 
 
 mere saath
 
 
 This is not a dream

 Everything has happened to him

 The Are you sitting in the theater

 The subconscious lives on

 But this place
 
 
 yah kshat-vikshat rup
 
 
 Each scene was clearly visible
 
 
 bhayanak tej barish ho rahi thi
 The color of the earth and the sky had become the same
 
 
 saamne khadaa aadmi tak dikhaai nahin de rahaa tha
 Due to the slap of strong wind, she was slipped twice and kept falling
 roj kii dekhi-jaani pahachaani sadaken thim
 
 
 
 vahi samay tha jab vah badminton kii practice karke lautaa karti thi
 They were the same office
 vahi ghar the
 
 
 Thought, let's stand for a while, although at that time she also remembered the instructions of the mother not to stop, but it was better to stay for a while than standing or falling on the road in fierce water
 
 
 
 or bhi log khadey the
 
 
 Water was not taking the name of freezing
 
 
 sadakon par
 
 
 The water was flowing like ravines
 
 
 andheraa badhata ja rahaa tha
 His heart started to panic
 
 
 chalanaa chahie
 
 
 Whatever happens will be seen
 
 
 aaj kaa din hi kharaab he
 
 
 He started the scooter, but it did not
 “aap scooter start kar denge
 
 
 ! " He told a man who was soaked despite wearing a raincoat
 “plag main pani bhar gaya hoga
 "" Here's the phone
 
 
 
 "" Is in front
 
 
 
 "she ran to the other side
 
 
 magar vahaan do ladakon ko
 
 
 Looking back, she returned and did not know why she did not like to go there
 
 
 ve ladke uske peeche-peeche aakar khadey ho gayi
 
 
 Now there were few people there
 
 
 achaanak hi shater girane kii aawaaj sunai di
 At first he felt loud thunder, somewhere lightning fell
 ghupp andheraa ho gaya tha
 Why shut the shutter? Open, he wanted to run and lift the shutter, but strong hands pulled him towards him loudly, with ruthlessness
 uski awaajen haahaakaar karti barish main villin ho gayin
 word
 
 
 naale main girte pani main bah gayi
 
 
 Even after tireless struggle, she could not protect herself
 
 
 tufaan main
 
 
 She was lying on the ground like an uprooted tree
 
 
 nichode gayi fal ke chhilake kii tarah
 When she got up, someone put hot bars under the thighs
 
 
 besakhta cheekh nikal padi
 
 
 He did not know what this scream would make his life from
 
 
 kya hua? vahi cheekh hawa ke saath laharaakar ek cycle savaar ke kaanon main padi
 
 
 The scream of a thick sheet of trembling shutter forced the man to stop
 palatakar aayaa vah
 Where did that cry come from? 
 
 kshanon tak usne idhar-udhar dekha
 
 
 vision
 
 
 shater par jaakar thahar gayi
 It is not locked
 
 
 isi ke andar to nahin he koi? usne shater uthaayi
 "take me home"
 saamne baithi
 
 
 The girl was speaking eloquently
 
 
 use dar tha kahin yah aadmi bhi use ghasitkar jameen par na daal de
 The man was surprised to see him
 isi bich “dekho kya ho gaya
 
 
 "more people had come for the curiosity"
 
 
 barish ab tak kuch kam ho gayi thi
 "tell me the phone number
 kahan rahati ho?”thodi der baad hi pita saamne khadey the
 The father felt accident, but there was a different scene here
 unke paanvon se jameen dhasakane lagi, ek shilakhand chakanachur padaa tha
 The whispers of the people were increasing, "goth was the brother-in-law
" koun the? kya kisi ne nahin bachaaya? akeli ladki ko dekhakar
 
 
 what will happen now? Poor thing! Life is ruined ”“aajkal kii ladkiyaan bhi to sunati nahin hai
 She goes anywhere

 ”“are! ye to apane verma sahab kii ladki he
 
 
 His family's clan was destroyed
 ”pita nazren nahin uthaa paa rahe the
 Lips were fastened like the deceased
 unhone car kaa darwaja kholaa or teji ke saath ladki ko lagbhag khinchate hue-se baitaakar- itani teji ke saath car chalaakar le gayi, maano is jagah kii dharti fatanevaali ho
 Mother and the others were standing at the gate
 unhone ekadam daravaaje ke paas gaadi ada di
 She was walking tightly and barely moving
 
 
 kuch kadam chalakar bheetar pahunchaa ja saktaa tha
 What happened? Where did it hurt? Who did the accident? Why did not you go to the hospital
 
 
 poochhate logon ko yakaayak hi aasmaan ko tharra dene vaali chikhen sunai padane lageen
 
 
 Uncontrolled hysterical voices
 
 
 lag rahaa tha nadi kii vegavati dhara hajaaron feet gaharaai se jaakar gir rahi ho
 
 
 The same roaring cry
 
 
 sabake hridayon main utarataa ja rahaa tha
 
 
 Lightning broke on everyone's faces
 baichaiyn-se ve sab khidki se jhaankane lage
 The girl's body was lying blind
 ghayal chidipha kii tarah tadap rahi thi vah
 
 
 The sister was sitting on him
 
 
 samajhate der na lagi
 After all, the ugly truth of the world came to the fore
 
 
 yatnadaayi rup main guzarane lagi
 Today nobody asked permission to go
 ek ke baad ek log chale gayi
 Words of regret and concern were on the tongue
 aankhon main dayaa kaa bhav umad aayaa tha
 Suddenly, there was utter silence outside
 bade get par taala laga diya gaya
 Close the door of the room and open the fan at full speed
 pankhe kii dhwani puure kamare main goonj rahi thi gharr
 
 
 House 
 
 or doosraa pankhaa unke apane bheetar chal rahaa tha

 Sanan-sanan

 "what will happen now?
 
 
 ” unka man
 
 
 It was an euphemism
 
 
 magar saamne patni baithi thi sir jhukaaye
 a burden was placed on his head
 aansuon kii dhara ni:shabd bah rahi thi
 Can i cry so silently? The whole body had become paralyzed, it was like seeing them
 unhone paanv thapthapaayen
 
 
 So that they move, but
 
 
 koi harakat na hui unke sharir main
 
 
 Did not go anywhere if anything happens
 
 
 sochakar kaanp gayi ve
 
 
 
 bahin chaay banaakar le ja rahi thi- phir pani
 
 
 Then the clothes
 ghar main sabhi goongon ke samaan baithe the
 
 
 Who should tell? What to tell? Will be able to recognize? " The brother could barely speak, Lawe's heat on his face and red balls were bursting in his eyes
 use lag rahaa tha
 
 
 The disgusting scene of a film is stuck on his consciousness but
 
 
 bahin ko saamne yun padaa dekhakar
 
 
 truth
 
 
 man ko mathe de rahaa tha
 "don't talk now
" ” bahin ne bharraye kanth se kaha
 Her body was full of tremors and whatever she used to lift, she slipped or fell from her hands
 
 
 lag rahaa tha maheenon baad beemaari se uthi ho
 The darkness had turned into gloom and depression
 megh akaash ko aachhadit kiye hue the
 Insects were flying lightly
 barish kaa pani jagah-jagah bharaa hua tha
 
 
 
 kentue-hi-kentue pade the
 
 
 Red earthworm 
 
 ghar main matam-sa sannata chaaya tha magar mrityu ke samay to log paraspar baat bhi kar lete hai
 Together they mourn or mourn, in this mourning, no one was able to sit with anyone, far from talking
 
 
 
 The phone rings continuously
 is baar unhone resiver uthaakar rakh diya
 "must report
 ”“badanaami karwaane ke liye
 ""medical
 
 
 ?”“shobhaa (doctor) ko phone kar do yaa le aao
 ""what will happen now

 “kuch bataaya
 
 
 The Show them to the doctor too

 ”“kaha tha mat bheja karo
 Used to roam alone
 jahaan man main aayaa chal di
 The world is dangerous, people have no faith, but
 
 
 ” kehete-kehete unke jabade bhinch gayi
 Eyes hung in the void
 puraa bhavishya saamne aakar khadaa ho gaya
 If you go among the people of the society, people will not ask what
 
 
 ? koun shaadi karegaa
 
 
 The If someone does, the person in front will make him realize that you are him
 
 
 phir iske bacchon ko bhi pataa chalegaa, bachche kya kahenge? shaadi na karen to? baahar bhej denge aisi jagah jahaan koi na jaanata ho magar kaise? puraa parivaar hi kahin chalaa jaae
 
 
 away
 
 
 tab bhi log kahenge verma ne shahar isliye choda kyonki unki ladki ke saath
 
 
 He felt something swirling in his chest
 ve jor-jor se saans khinchne lage
 
 
 Massage began to be loud, my baby girl! Your life! He woke up 
 
 daudkar baahar gayi
 
 
 In the open air, darkness was dull
 sanasanaata hua
 How long did he stand
 man fadafadaaya, jaakar santvanaa den use
 Apply it on the chest
 magar utani hi teji ke saath peeche palat gayi
 Sat down on the chair with chant
 khuli aankhon ke saamne unhone raat ko bitate hue dekha
 
 
 
 khabaren to failni hi thim, so subah se hi paariwarik-mitron kaa aana shuru ho gaya
 There were expressions of friendship on the faces of friends
 kya puuchhen, kya bataayen vaali man:sthiti thi
 "got something? Reported? What had to happen has been done
 sawaal ye he ki bacchee ko kaise sanbhaala jaae
 It can have a very bad effect
 ”“saamne dikh to jaaen saalon ko goli maar den
 "" The more the world is moving forward, the more life is becoming insecure
 ”“bahu-betiyon kii izzat surakshit na rahe to kya phayda?”“uski tabiyat kisi he?”“sadamein main he
 "showed the doctor?" "she went looking at night
 ”“kahan gayi thi?”“khelkar aa rahi thi
 "" How many were there
 
 
 ?”ekaek puche gayi prashn ne unako bhasma kar diya
 The number of times the arrows of the questions are released - the more times they are consumed and die
 jhuki ankhen na uthaa sake
 Got up and went inside
 mitra ne andar se aati karaahen sunin to bhagkar gayi
 He felt the edge of his words
 “aap itane kamjor pad jaayenge to baaki kaa kya hoga? vah meri bhi to bacchee he
 i can understand 
 
 saamana to karnaa padegaa aapako
 Friends began to hold their shoulders and explain
 
 
 
 "what will happen to him? Where to take it? " Tears were dripping from his eyes
 
 
 pita kii mrityu par bhi ankhen sirf nam hui thim, lekin abhi aansuon main dubi thim
 Nobody was leaving the house
 bhai hi alabatta is bich ek-do chakkar lagaakar aayaa tha us jagah kaa
 Once the mill is full
 
 
 main kisi durdasha
 
 
 I'll do them
 aisi jagah le jaakar maarunga ki chil-coy naunchakar khaayenge
 But when i go out, how will people see me? What would you say? No, my friends are not like that, they too will be sad
 ve meraa saath denge
 It is also possible that they do not know anything, i will not tell myself
 uskaa por-por hajaaron bichchhuon ke maare dank-sa dukh rahaa tha
 
 
 Poison was running all over the body
 aankhon main neend na thi
 No food was eaten
 kitna naaj tha use apni bahin par
 Such a good player
 usee ne to jid karke jwine karavaaya tha
 What will happen to him now? He got up secretly and peeped
 vah karavat liye leti thi
 And if there was time, he would punch back
 din bhar kii baaten bataata
 Listens to her uski saheliyon ke bare main kuch hansee majaak karata
 She would make coffee
 vah do-chaar nakhre dikhaata
 He stood there stopping the sound of steps
 aakhir hua kya jo mere or uske bich itani duuri aa gayi
 Wanted to run and hug
 puchkaar le use, lekin paanv barf kii tarah jame rahe
 The iron inside kept melting
 galata rahaa
 He held his head
 cheekhti-chillaati bahin uske saamne padi he
 Unintentional bodies are broken on it
 
 
 uske munh se anayas nikal padaa- haramjaadon! kaminon! jinda nahin chhodunga

 maar daaloonga
 He came and fell on the bed
 sir main tej dard ho rahaa tha
 He seemed to have deep wounds
 nasen fat janaa chaahati hai
 He tied his head tightly with a dupatta lying nearby
 kaanon main duubataa-chubhta kuch sunai pad rahaa tha
 
 
 "what's your fault?" The whole house is with you
 durghatana thi
 He will be punished
 milani hi chahie
 The sister was explaining it to him
 phir usne suna nickstabdh-raatri ke gahraate duubate andhkaar main kuch sisakiyaan deevaaron se takaraa rahi thim

 And the place with shutter was sealed by the police, because the boy sitting there escaped
 in sab prakriyaaon se guzarate hue ladki pratikriyavihin maspind kii bhanti jo jaisaa kahata, karti jaati
 But after getting into her deep, every moment, every scene was resurrected again and again
 
 
 kai baar to sabakuch swapn prathit lagata
 If you wake up many times, you will tell your sister, but then i realized it was not a dream, i would wake up
 
 
 saans lete sansar main uski chetana ko is satya kaa saakshaatkaar ho hi jaataa
 
 
 
 uskaa ghar tha
 There was a room, there were posters
 chup rahane vaali maan thi, goongi baheri-si
 There was a brother who used to roam the entire house, smiling in restless and anxious moments
 chakkar katata hua
 Where did you go? Where did you come from? No one seemed to know the news
 
 
 uski aankhon main aisi aag dadhakati hui dikhaai detii thi ki vah sihar jaati thi
 While eating food, he used to slam the glass or bounce it around the plate or his own clothes
 anayas hi kisi keede yaa chinte ko paanv se itani shakti ke saath ragad detaa, jaise uskaa naamo-nishaan mitaa dena chahta ho
 Layers of despair and sorrow were being accumulated on the soul
 kitna kuch kahana chaahati he vah magar hont hi nahin khulte
 When used to speak, the tongue started twitching - as if someone has caught a tip from inside
 vahiin ankhen hai
 
 
 But these eyes are crowded with the same gruesome scenes
 
 
 jaise hi baahar kii duniya kaa khyaal aata he, anek chehre saamne aa jate
 
 
 If you go to play badminton, everyone will ask - what happened? What will she tell? If you tell, then how many would they ask? She would have closed her eyes, but then other faces would have come
 college jaaegi to vahaan dost puuchhengi- kya hua tha? kya tuune virodh nahin kiya? bhaag jaati
 Why stop? How did you become so weak? How were you How many were there? 
 
 poochhate vakt kaise chehre banenge un sabake
 
 
 Mercy-sympathy eagerness
 
 
 phir
 
 
 joke
 
 
 phir
 
 
 People from where they will come out will see her and say, this is the girl with whom
 
 
 o bhagwaan! kya iske alaava
 
 
 Nothing will exist in me
 
 
 ekmaatr uski pahchaan kaa kendrabindu
 
 
 This event will be formed
 
 
 nahin
 No
 
 
 main bhaag jaaongi
 
 
 Will go 
 
 is duniya se dur
 
 
 Away from this identity
 
 
 magar man
 Where will he drive it
 
 
 vah to saath main hi rahegaa
 
 
 She got up and stood up
 
 
 puri deh jhunjhuna rahi thi
 She began to shake the inner voices by placing her hands on her ears
 
 
 sara cameraa ghumta hua lag rahaa tha
 The sky was seen descending and the earth was getting knocked down
 andhkaar kaa saghan vaatyachakra chaaron ore gum rahaa tha
 
 
 Someone hold me
 
 
 roko
 Look, I'm flying
 
 
 main jameen main dhans rahi hoon
 
 
 She was screaming in mind
 
 
 magar shabd bhanvar main fasakar rah gayi the
 
 
 After some time
 
 
 usne dekha
 
 
 The sister is giving him glucose water
 
 
 or
 
 
 Oil is rubbing on the head
 
 
 tap tap tapakate aansuon ne uske gaalon ko dho diya tha
 Had not seen outside mouth for four weeks
 nahin dekhi thi subah kii dhoop
 Did not see the brightness of the day
 nahin dekha tha sandhyabela kaa udhaas patjhad-sa tukdaa
 She was locked in a room alone
 kamare se bathroom tak uskaa aana-janaa tha
 It had not spoken to anyone for days
 
 
 yahan tak ki papa tak ko nahin dekha tha
 Sometimes when they would come up or hear their voice, she would sit down or close the door
 ajeeb sa bhay tathaa santaap usko jakad letaa tha un kshanon, bai ne bhi us kamare main janaa band kar diya tha
 The dust had settled on the TV and the cassette player
 
 
 ghar main dubdubaata
 
 
 Nostalgia used to take a shake
 college khulne ke thik ek maah baad bahin gayi thi
 Taking her and her marksheets
 kab rigelt niklaa kab kya hua kisi ko hosh hi na tha
 Phone calls from friends were at home
 donon ek hi college main padhati thim so uski saheliyaan use bhi jaanati thim
 a sister went to college to hide herself from everywhere
 dekhakar bhi andekha kaa bhav liye
 
 
 As she was walking out, she saw Anisha running towards her
 “kya admician nahin karwaanaa he tuje? tum log kyon nahin aa rahi thim?”“bas yun hi
 "are you sick?" Is your face completely black? "" Yes, i was ill
 ” usne taalane kii koshish kii
 "papa was telling you with your sister
 
 
 
 "my father too, has stopped going to college
" ”“tumne kisi ko bataaya to nahin
 
 
 
 
 "she cried out
" “nahin
 
 
 On
 
 
 sabko pataa
 
 
 is
 
 
 main aauungi usase milane
 
 
 How many times did we call
 
 
 ? kaisaa lagata hoga usko sochakar rongte khadey ho jate hai mere to
 Him
 
 
 karant lag gaya ho, is tarah khadi rah gayi nishpraan
 Anesthetic
 to sabko pataa he
 Everyone
 
 
 puri class ko
 To the entire college
 puure shahar ko
 His hands and feet started shivering
 “kyon milanaa chaahati ho? nahin, vah kisi se nahin milegi, vah yahan nahin he
 Saying this, she came out fast
 peeche se aati awaajen usko chumbak kii tarah khinch rahi thim
 He felt that the whole college is raising a finger and telling that it is the same with whose sister
 
 
 usne gaadi kaa get band kiya
 She sat with her head on the wall of the car gate
 saanse tej-tej chal rahi thim
 The car was standing behind the branches of the tree, nothing was visible from outside
 sadak par gadipoon ke avaagaman ke kaaran itnaa tej shor ho rahaa tha ki uski sisakiyaan kisi ko sunai nahin de sakati thim
 What will happen to him? How will she come? Peel off all the skin of the body, even if you die, this thing
 
 
 yah rekha
 
 
 Will be pulled 
 
 
 Get away from here 
 
 magar vahaan koun sanbhaalega use? uske dard bhare kalankit jivan ko
 His tears were not stopping
 ghrinaa kaa bawandar uski nason main daud rahaa tha
 i will make them bleed
 maar daaloongi
 To destroy my sister's life! You will go to hell 
 
 sad-sadakar maroge
 
 
 God will not forgive you
 
 
 
 The pain of a life full of immense torture and water
 
 
 koun anubhav kar saktaa he
 
 
 He felt as if someone was stripping the body
 
 
 
 "mommy, send him out
 
 
 hostel yaa chachaa ke paas
 It is difficult to stay here
 log use jeene nahin denge
 "where alone?" with whom?" Mother's voice started coming from the deep well
 aajkal ve bhi kabhi-kabhaar hi bolti hai
 In the hostel
 yahan to sabhi ko pataa chal chukaa he
 Mother looked at the room with impatient eyes
 
 
 phir rundhe gale se boli, “aavesh main aakar kuch kar baithi to
 
 
 Did not see that day
 ”“kabhi-na-kabhi to nikalnaa hi padegaa
 It is a question of complete life
 
 
 
 "full life
" 
 
 ”sachmuch uski jindagi sivaa sawaalon ke kuch rah hi nahin gayi thi
 She went to her sister
 
 
 hriday umad padaa
 That was love
 chintaa thi
 Hiding his tears and lying on his lap like a child - “your result has been a seventh percentile
 form le aaye hai, let fees ke saath jamaa kar denge
 She said while trying to smile
 use lagata kyon nahin pehle kii tarah sab kuch saamaanya ho jaataa he
 The same noise, screaming
 
 
 chillaanaa
 
 
 To laugh 
 
 der raat tak pikchar dekhnaa
 
 
 To dance 
 
 geet sunanaa kyon nahin yah khamoshi tuutati he! kyon nahin sab ek saath baithkar baat karte
 Why not eat at the dining table
 kyon nahin bhula dete hai sab kuch
 
 
 
 magar kaise?
 
 
 Then there is no end to the fire in the forest
 koi chaaya he jo un sab ke bich main pasri he
 The girl did not even look at the marksheet
 
 
 bahin kaa cheharaa or ankhen dekhati rahi
 
 
 Everyone knows it
 
 
 vah puch rahi thi
 
 
 With eyes
 
 
 bahin ne munh pher liya
 
 
 
 donon bahinon ke bheetar samundar hiloren le rahaa tha
 
 
 Those images
 
 
 tandav
 
 
 Was doing 
 
 dhap
 
 
 o 
 
 unhone ek-duusare kaa haath kasakar pakad liya
 "you have to face everybody with courage
 dard kii aakhri seemaa tak
 To the last extent of insults, disgust, neglect and dictation
 ” bahin use samajha rahi thi
 
 
 
 'didi, shabd to tumhaare hai, lekin dard or wo haadasa to sirf meraa he
 
 
 Will it end with just saying? Will deepen more
 
 
 failata jayega
 
 
 indoor outdoor
 
 
 sab jagah
 i wish that a vein of the brain was cut and thrown so that we would become lifeless
 
 
 saamana karne bhar se yah dard dhul jaataa to main pahaad kii chotii par ek paanv se khadi ho jaati
 The storm would have faced the storm
 
 
 ’ vah kahana chaahati he magar nahin kah paa rahi he
 
 
 Words are stuck inside the gorge like stones
 pita jab bhi idhar aate hai, jhaankakar chale jate hai
 His face has shrunk like a dry tree
 rekhaayen kitni gahari or chaudee ho gayi hai
 Neither her name comes out of her mouth nor she is able to stand in front
 
 
 use samaj main nahin aata ki vah kya karen? meraa kya dosha he isamen? murti par jal chadhaanevaala bhakt kaha jaataa he
 Then why is the living idol of a living idol not considered a sinner? Why is it not excluded? Why does he go round the chest of fearless Belihaz society
 
 
 ve chehre andhere kii parat ko chirate hilaate-dulaate ve badboo bhare chehre
 
 
 They are strict
 
 
 kaanton bhare chehre
 
 
 She drowns in unconsciousness
 
 
 ghutati hui uski saansen or kachi hari doodhbhari shaakh ke upar paini kulhadi ke jor se girane kii khachaak-si cheer bhari awaz ko samete wo dard main dubi lagaataar chatpataati rahati
 Ahh
 
 
 ! nahin! nahin! kahan jaaon
 
 
 The What to do? Why don't i faint? Why does not my memory get mad
 
 
 kaash
 
 
 i would have died
 
 
 vakt kaa wo tukdaa meri chetana se kaise dur hoga
 
 
 Oh god 
 
 koi to rasta sujhaao, kya maut hi rasta he is nirmam ghrunit anubhav kaa? jab court main maamla chalegaa to kaisaa tamaasha banegaa meraa
 
 
 
 main nahin jaaongi court main! jaaongi! nahin! nahin jaaongi! vah do rakshason se bhid rahi thi apane andar
 When it was not tolerated, it started running loud and fast
 
 
 or tej
 
 
 So fast as to faint
 
 
 magar behosh hone se pehle hi yakaayak paanv ruk gayi
 
 
 Saw, Papa is standing in front
 
 
 kshanon tak uski aankhon main siharan kaanpi jaise bhabhuka uthaa ho aag kaa
 
 
 She went to the terrace
 
 
 thande farsh par aundhi padi kaanp rahi thi vah
 The speed of crying was not stopping that father sent his mother
 
 
 maan ne bahin ko
 
 
 
 “kya hua?”“didi, papa kii aankhon main nafrat thi
 ""hatred! No, why would there be hatred
 santaap, laachaargi
 
 
 And it will be painful
 tumhen dekhakar unke dil par kya bitati hogi sochaa kabhi tumne? tum normal ho jaaogi to papa bhi thik ho jaayenge
 Time will heal our wounds
 log bhul jaayenge sab kuch
 Father is thinking of shifting from here
 
 
 
 "" Everyone will see like this
 
 
 poochhega
 
 
 Will talk? "" Life is your own
 kisi par ashrith mat rahanaa
 
 
 Study, do a job baahar chali jaao

 Will always be with you, will never be separated
 
 
 
 "what if everyone forgets you?" 
 
 mere bheetar to vahi chalata rahata he
 
 
 All the same
 
 
 kaat sakogi smriti kaa wo bhayanak rongte khadaa kar dene vaala ansh

 dard kaa gubaar uthta he or
 
 
 Chest
 
 
 kandhe or haath
 
 
 Touching 
 
 nikal jaataa he
 
 
 
 “tum college kyon nahin jate? kya admician nahin lenaa he
 
 
 What would you do?" The sister went to the brother and sat down
 sab kuch saamaanya karnaa chaahati he vah
 Change the atmosphere in some way
 “kaise jaaon? bataao
 i will go crazy, sister
 pataa nahin kis-kisko maaloom hoga
 
 
 How will i face it? What to say? You tell me ”“sab kuch chhodkar baithne se kya hoga?”“meri himmat nahin he didi! aisi aag lagi rahati he ki lagata
 
 
 Burst your head or if you find a bastard
 
 
 ek-ek ko jinda jala don
 
 
 
 ”“isse kya hoga
 
 
 ? "" There was such a big accident and i am sitting like this
 
 
 nakaara
 
 
 Bitchy ” vah swayan ko dhikkaarta hua bolaa
 "go to college
 
 
 ek saal barbaad ho jayega
 
 
 
 ”“hamaara to ek saal barbaad hoga
 
 
 He only has life 
 
 
 Saying that
 
 
 mukke maarane laga
 Agreed to go with great difficulty
 ab tak jitne doston ke phone aate the, manaa karvaa detaa tha yaa miltaa hi na tha
 Even if he went to college a few times, he did not dare to go inside
 scooter khadaa karke offis kii taraf ja hi rahaa tha ki dost mil gaya
 
 
 
 “kahan gaya tha tu? kab se nahin mili ham? admician bhi legaa yaa nahin
 Practicals have started
 ”“baahar gaya tha kaam se

 “ghar main koi problem he?”“khaas nahin
 Did anyone say anything? " He asked apprehensively
 “koi bataa rahaa tha ki
 
 
 Let it go
 
 
 bataa tu college kab se aa rahaa he

 ?”“tera rigelt kya rahaa

 "he began to tremble with charge
 “police main report to kii he
 Something was discovered for years
 fadkar rakh denge
 How many times did i call to go and find out? milakar dhundhen
 But someone 
 
 baat nahin karwaata tha
 
 
 Some find out who they were
 
 
 ” vah jaanata tha college aane par yahi sab hoga
 
 
 These questions will have to follow the sharp edge
 
 
 
 "do not say anything
 ” uski aankhon main nirihata kaa bhav utar aayaa, “honge to aasapaas ke hi
 Meet once

 Man, we were very tense

 How is everyone at home? Sister is fine

 Questioning questions, his friends surrounded him
 
 
 
 "well, tell me he was alone or
 
 
 ?” dost ne shabdon ko chabate hue poocha
 “shut up, all of you
 bhagwaan ke vaaste chup raho
 "he shouted so loudly that people around him started to look shocked
 “sori yaar
 Forgive me
 teri bahin kya meri bahin nahin he? main samaj saktaa hoon tere dil par kya guzar rahi hogi? magar ham bhi kaise bhai hai, hamaari bahin ke saath itnaa bada haadasa ho gaya or ham munh chhupaakar baithe hai
 The friend said with sympathy holding her trembling hands
 
 
 magar
 
 
 that
 
 
 vahaan ruk na sakaa
 
 
 He started the scooter and came home flying in the air
 danaadan sidhiphan chadhataa hua upar aayaa or jor se darwaja kholaa
 Holding the sister's hand in front, she was almost dragged and said, "come on, tell me
" pahachaano koun the ve kamine

 "no brother, no

 "have you gone mad?" Where is it going? " Mother said separating him
 lekin usne maan ko bhi dhakel diya
 
 
 Sister and father came running away
 
 
 
 "leave him
 
 
 chhod do

 “hamaara jeena mushkil ho gaya he
 If you go out of the house, then you know that everyone knows

 He started beating hands on the walls

 “isamen iskaa kya dosha he? bataao
 You are doing these kinds of acts instead

 Girl cunningly
 
 
 roye ja rahi thi
 
 
 
 uski puri deh tharathar kaanp rahi thi
 Hiccups were not stopping
 
 
 
 "where shall we go?" 
 
 kya karen
 
 
 ? "" If your people can be saved from my death, then i die
 mujhase to pucho ki mujh par kya guzar rahi he? isamen meraa kya dosha he? mujhe apane hi sharir se kitni ghin lagane lagi he

 She survived, literally

 Inside the cranium

 Shirah 
 
 sabakuch duubataa-sa laga
 
 
 Ocean of darkness

 There was no sound coming out from the throat
 gardan par dupattey kii ragad se gahare nishaan pad gayi the
 She was lying in a state of half-consciousness
 teenon log use gherkar baithe the
 
 
 Panic rubbing his hands and feet and soles

 Now a new dreadful situation was created - should he not commit suicide
 sab ek-duusare se ankhen chura rahe the
 Sitting in one place, far away
 
 
 hote ja rahe the
 
 
 Such a strong wall was built around them that they all splashed around to get free, but there was someone who would laugh
 
 
 hriday ko phadqe lagata tha
 
 
 The girl opened her eyes
 saghan maun
 
 
 Faces immersed in depression, anxiety and anguish

 Was sitting in the chair

 If they are beaten and beaten, they too can kill the brother

 The girl's heart with this new fear
 
 
 siharne laga
 
 
 He had started worrying more than his brother now
 “pahchaan logi na?” bhai phir saamne tha
 So close that she could not lift her eye
 
 
 usko thik se dikhaai bhi nahin de rahaa tha kyonki ab bhi chakkar aa rahe the
 "yes!" shook her head
 “kaise the ve

 “jab shater giraayi to kitne log the? kaise the?” vah ghutanon main munh dabaakar baith gayi
 His jaws began to clench
 
 
 nason main sanasanaata hua jehar bahane laga, lekin vah dridhtaa se bataane kii koshish karne lagi
 She wanted to scorch the dying girl from inside, but
 
 
 
 "tell, tell, you want me to live

 to bataao
 Throughout my life, i cannot live with this burden that i could not do anything for my sister
