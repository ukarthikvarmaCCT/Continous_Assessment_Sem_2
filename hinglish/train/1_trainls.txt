 'RAW' movie review: ro yani romeo akbar walter (RAW- Romeo Akbar Walter) kii kahani 1971 ke dauraan kii he, jab bharat pakistan ke bich jang chal rahi thi
 Apart from the patriots fighting in the battle of the field, there are some people who are anonymous but do not lose their sacrifice
 'RAW' aisi hi film he jisamen ek jasoos kii kahani dikhaai gai he, jise ek mishan ko anjaam dena he
 John Abraham played this character of a detective
 lekin bina romaanch or khinchi hui kahani kii vajah se majaa kirkira ho jaataa he
 The story of RAW is that of banker John Abraham
 jis par khufia vibhaag ke chif jaiki shroff kii najar padati he or vah use ek under-cover mishan ke liye chun letaa he
 Romeo acquires a new identity and sets out on his mission in Pakistan
 is tarah romeo apane mishan main jute jaataa he, lekin uskaa hashr kya hota he, yah film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Being a film based on the life of John Abraham and Detective, there will be some spice action in it, it would be a big mistake to think about it
 kahani kaa vishay acha hone ke baavjood film kaa treetment jaayaka bigaad detaa he
 Director Robbie Grewal has not been able to put his idea on screen
 film kii chaal dhimi he or kahani bhi kai maukon par kamjor pad jaati he
 These days, the focus of John Abraham is on patriotic films, and he has played the character of Romeo Akbar Walter and he has tried his best to get into the character
 jaiki shroff bhi khufia vibhaag ke pramukh ke taur par thik-thaak hai
 Sikander Kher has acted well
 mauni roy bhi film main hai lekin mauni ko yahi salaah ki unhen badi filmon ke bajaay apane majboot role ke bare main sochna chahie
 In this era of patriotic films, RAW brings a good subject but due to weak directions and drawn story the film derails
 vaise bhi ham ‘raji' jaisi shandaar film dekh chuke hai, aise main ‘RAW' se badi ummiden thim, lekin film us kasuti par khari nahin utarati he

 Police sources told here today that Shahid (17), a resident of Asara village of Ramala police station area, used to work in making umbrellas in Delhi
 vah id par apane gaanv aayaa tha
 Yesterday when he got out of the house to go to Delhi, then someone from his front house gave a voice to Shahid
 is par vah us ghar kii khidki ke paas pahunchaa to andar se ek goli chali, jo uski gardan main lagi or uski maukey par hi maut ho gai
 Angered by this incident, the local villagers created a ruckus in front of the police who came to collect the body for the post-mortem
 hatyaropiyon kii giraftaar kii maang kar rahe graminon ne kareeb chah ghante tak shav police ko nahin saunpa
 Late in the night Additional Superintendent of Police Ajay Kumar reached Asara village and assured the victim family to take strict action against the accused

 The Supreme Court has submitted a petition against the singing of Sanskrit prayers in morning prayers in the central schools to the Constitution Bench

 During the hearing on this petition, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Center, said that Sanskrit shlokas mean global truth and that mere writing in Sanskrit does not make them communal
 vahiin jaj nariman ne kaha ki sanskrit 'shloke' jinka zikr kiya gaya he, vah upanishdon se liye gaye hai
 To this, Mehta said that it is written in every court room of the Supreme Court, 'yato Dharma Stato Jai:', which is taken from the Mahabharata

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav while stating the need to extend the noida-agra Entrance Controlled Expressway to Lucknow and said that it will also benefit the farmers and people of the area concerned
 mukhyamantri ne yahaan shastri bhawan sthit apane sabhakaksh main agra-lakhanu pravesh niyantrit express-ve green field pariyojna par aadhaarit prastutikaran dekhne ke baad kaha ki unki sarkaar pradesh kii khushhaali ke liye ucchstareey gunvattta evam suvidhaon se yukt sadakon ke nirmaan ke paksh main he or noida-agra pravesh niyantrit express-ve ko lakhanu tak badhaayaa janaa chaiye
 He instructed to arrange adequate underway and catalway in the proposed expressway from Agra to Lucknow and said that service lanes should also be constructed on both sides
 akhilesh ne kaha ki agra-lakhanu express-ve jin ilaakon se hokar gujaregaa vahaan mandiyon ke vikaas ke alaava kisaanon kii upaj ko bade bazaaron tak pahunchane kaa avasar milegaa
 Along with this, farmers will get the facility of quickly perishable vegetables and seasonal fruits in urban areas
 unhone kaha ki is express-ve ke ban jane se firozabad main glass city kii sthapana bhi kii ja sakati he
 The completion of this project will reduce the distance and travel time from Delhi to Lucknow
 iske purv, mukhyamantri ke samaksh agra-lakhanu pravesh niyantrit express-ve green field pariyojna par aadhaarit prastutikaran main bataaya gaya ki sadak maarg se agra-lakhanu kii duuri 350 kilometre he
 After the construction of this expressway, this distance will be reduced to about 274 km
 is prakaar agra-lakhanu tak kii yatra maatr teen ghante main puri kii ja sakegi
 It was informed in the presentation that the proposed six-lane expressway will be expanded to 8 lanes

 To protect from the flood, the expressway will be kept very high above the ground surface and a green field strip more than 10 meters will be prepared on both sides
 is pariyojna kii laagat lagbhag 9500 crores rupaye aanki gayi he
 This expressway will pass very close to Firozabad Shikohabad Etawah Mainpuri Kannauj and Malihabad

 The 10 findings that India Today and Aaj Tak managing editor Rahul Kanwal took after covering a week-long campaign in Karnataka - local experts always have a much deeper understanding of the equations for every seat in the state
 lekin chunavi ran main utre sabhi teen partiyon ke ahm yoddhaon ke saath ghanton bitaane or jin kshetron kii hamane yatra kii, vahaan ke matadaataaon se baat karne ke baad maine karnataka ke kaante ke chunaav ko lekar 10 ahm nishkarsh nikaale hai

 bhrashtachar jameen se zyada tivi par bada muddaprime time tivi tok shoj main kai-kai ghante reddy bhaaiyon kii siyaasi bahaali se judi bahes par khapaae gaye or kaise bijepi ke bhrashtachar virdohi raag kii hawa nikali jab party ne bellari ke daagi aayran mafia ke karibiyon ko 8 tikaton se nawaja
 The BJP is attacking the Siddaramaiah government under its campaign, calling it 10% government
 pradhanmantri modi ne bhi mukhyamantri ko 'sidhaa-rupaiya' bataa kar nishaanaa saadhaa
 The sad fact is that the voters are not paying much attention to the allegations of corruption against both parties
 bellari bhaaiyon kii bellari ke aasapaas ke teen jilon main khaasi pakad najar aati he or bahut asaar he ki in jilon kii 22 siton main se bada hissaa bijepi kii jholii main hi jaae
 The Congress has also given tickets to people associated with the mining mafia
 aise mencongress bhi bhrashtacharke mudde par naitikta kii oonchi jameen par hone kaa daawa nahin kar sakati
 Strategists from both parties feel that it is far better to answer some difficult and uncomfortable questions in interviews and press conferences rather than losing seats in the circle of morality lessons
 pradhanmantri ne aise netaaon par prahaar kiye jinhone moped se shuruyaat kii thi or ab ek se badhkar ek lagjri gadiyon main chalate hai or aaleeshaan makaanon main rahete hai
 Such leaders can be seen in all the parties in the state
 netaaon kii ore se shaan-shaukat dikhaane main andhra pradesh ke baad karnataka kaa doosraa sthaan lagata he
 The hapless voter seems to have given up on his fate and is more interested in which leader can help him more

 Lingayat's betting could not be played One of the important issues discussed in this election was the running of Lingayat card by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 mukhyamantri ne iske tahat rajya ke 17% lingayat samudaay ko alpsankhyak darja dene kii peshkash kii
 As soon as the announcement was made by the Chief Minister, there were speculations whether the Lingayat vote would turn towards the Congress
 jameen par, aisa kuch bhi hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Yes, this cannot be said for some of the monasteries who openly advocated this step of Siddaramaiah
 iskaa arth ye he ki alpsankhyak samudaay kaa darja dene kaa daanv bhi bijepi ke lingayat vot-bank ko todane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaya he
 The Veerashaiva community seems strongly in favor of the BJP and its attempt to defeat a man who tried to divide them
 yahaan tak ki congress bhi ye maanati he ki uske paksh main lingayat voton main koi khaas badhotaree nahin hogi
 The top Congress leaders are now claiming that they never expected the BJP to wipe out Lingayat votes in a big way
 haa, lingayat daanv ne itnaa jarur kiya ki is samudaay kii khuli daraaron kaa bhed lene ke chakkar main bijepi ko asthaayee taur par defensive mod main laa diya
 Siddaramaiah played his cards well with a strategy aimed at defeating the enemy on his own pitch

 Rahul Gandhi is getting in his job
 One of the biggest problems of Rahul Gandhi was earlier believed that he fails to carry his own army united behind him
 rahul ke apane cirkil ke logon se hi shikayaton kii lambii fehrist pehle suni jaati thi ki kaise faisle lene main bos kii asamarthta aade aati he or kaise nihit swaarthon kii ore se kaan bharne par prabhaav main aane kii unki pravriti he
 Now it seems that circumstances are changing
 rahul kii sena ab unke peeche adhik majbootee se dati najar aati he
 At the same time, his warriors do not get tired of claiming that Rahul is now a changed person who has finally started taking strong decisions
 rahul bhi ab vahi game khelte najar aa rahe hai jo ki or netaa khelte hai
 While tracking Rahul's campaign, one of his colleagues told us, 'no one can wear a hat to a boss anymore
 ’gujarat campagne ke dauraan bhi aisi kai report ai thim ki rahul pehle se badale- badale najar aate hai
 Since then, his confidence now seems to have moved up a notch
 gujarat main najdiki haar ne rahul ko vahi vishwaas diya jo ab tak modi-shah kii jodi main nihit mana jaataa rahaa he
 Now when speaking of Rahul, a person who looks like he thinks he is winning
 pehle rahul vyaktigat rup se piem modi par hamalaa karne main bahut saavdhaanee baratate the, lekin ab lagata he ki unhone khule prahaar karne kaa rasta pakadaa he
 However, it remains to be seen whether it will be a smart move for Rahul that the man who has no administrative experience wants to fight the paw directly with India's most formidable politician
 lekin rahul kaa ye faisla myne rakhata he
 The way to make your political streak politically is to be created by demolishing the Modi saga
 yahaan tak ki bijepi ke top netaa bhi maan rahe hai ki congress ne is chunaav main tikat bantwaaraa acchhee tarah kiya he
 At the same time, the Congress has also been successful in managing the conflicting interests within the party
 pichley chunaavon main, congress netaaon ke bhitarghaat ne hi kai siton par party ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Rahul seems to have managed to curb this to a great extent
 congress main aise kai netaa hai jo siddharmaiya se khaar khate hai, lekin unamem se koi bhi khule taur par aisa kaam nahin karata dikh rahaa jo party ke hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaae

 bharat ke sabase behatar pradarshan dikhaane vaale CEO- amit shahrahul gandhi kii dikkat yah he ki unka muqabla amit shah jaise shaks se he
 On the one hand, in recent years, the Congress organization has been very flattened, while Shah has rapidly reinvigorated the BJP organization, which in itself is a management success story
 wo kahani jo kisi top ivi lig skool main MBA cese study ke liye puri tarah feet he
 In many states, the Congress has very little real organizational structure
 congress aise majboot sthaneey netaaon ke haathon main he jo apane prabhaav vaale kshetron main party ummidavaaron kii madad karte hai
 If any of these leaders leave the Congress, then the party structure in that particular area goes with them
 is tarah ke jatke congress ko kamjor bana dete hai
 Shah has been continuously cashing in on the bjp's right to this flaw of the Congress
 saath hi amit shah desh ke har nukkad main bijepi ke liye majboot dhaancha banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Shah works on the smallest unit settings
 jis tarah bijepi har ghar main apane sandeshon kii bharmaar karne main samarth rahati he, is maamle main wo congress se milon aage he
 In the current situation, the difference between the Congress and BJP armies is as large as it was between the Indian and Chinese forces during the 1962 war
 bijepi kii ore se nae yug ke eps ke istemaal ke saath kai watsap group kaa sahaara liya janaa, saath hi jameen par samarpit or jujharu kaaryakartaaon kii maujuudagi party ko matadaataaon tak jis str par pahunchane main madad karti he, vaisaa congress nahin kar sakati
 In such a situation, there is little scope for the local leaders to hold the party hostage
 bies yediurppa ke bete tak kaa tikat kaat diya jaataa he or wo kuch nahin kar pate
 Except that you should take the party's decision on your head and forehead by taking your key down the neck
 congress ke paas jamini str par seva dal naam kaa sanghathan hua karata tha, jo aresas kii tarj par hi congress ko chunaav ke vakt aakhri mile tak matadaataaon se sampark karaane main madad karata tha
 Due to the lack of attention for years, the Seva Dal has now become a weak shadow of its strong past
 bijepi sthaneey congress netaaon par dore daal kar apane saath jod hi rahi he, saath hi ye sunishchit bhi kar rahi he ki ye dalbadalu apane saath seva dal ke samarpit kaaryakartaaon ko bhi laaenge
 As long as Rahul Gandhi does not campaign on a war footing to strengthen the Congress organization from bottom to top and does not stand again to give a new edge to organizations like Seva Dal, he will have to face BJP in the election of thorns
 There is no hope
 najdiki ladaai main ye bahut myne rakhata he ki kis ke paas matadaataaon ko matdaan centre tak laane kii adhik kshamta he
 And this often becomes the reason for defeat and victory
 is maamle main bijepi kaa koi sani nahin he

 tej chamak rahaa he siddharmaiya kaa ‘bhagya’jahaan tak tikadmi netaaon kaa sawaal he to bijepi ko karnataka main siddharmaiya se kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 The Chief Minister has shown excellent performance in terms of political capabilities
 siddharmaiya is chunaav ke liye lagaataar agenda set karne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 It is generally seen that it is the BJP that attacks with its political ammunition and the front is forced to come under cover for defense
 vahiin is baar karnataka main chaahe rajya ke liye alag jhanda ho yaa hindi ke khilaaf ladaai yaa phir lingayat card kaa daanv, ye siddharmaiya hi the jinhone frontroot par aakar batting kii or bijepi ko jawaab dene ke liye baadhya hona padaa
 Wherever we went while chasing the campaign, we did not see the anti-incumbency factor being effective against Siddaramaiah
 aise main jab ki karnataka kaa 30 saal kaa itihaas rahaa he ki kisi bhi sattarudh party ko paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa hone ke baad satta dobaaraa nahin mili, siddharmaiya kii ye uplabdhi kam badi nahin he
 While traveling on the car with the Chief Minister, we saw that wherever the convoy passed, the face of people would glow after seeing their Chief Minister
 aayu varg koi bhi ho, logon main mukhyamantri ko lekar vaastavik rup se aabhaar kaa bhav dikhaa
 The Chief Minister's fortune plans have been a big success in the state
 asaliyat main har ghar ko kisi naa kisi sarkari yojana kaa laabh mila he
 It is a different matter that among the upper castes like Vokkaliga there is a great dislike for Siddaramaiah
 siddharmaiya ne unhen apane saath laane ke liye kuch vishesh kiya bhi nahin
 But in the electoral battle of backward and forward, it is always beneficial for the majority of the backward to be on one side
 ek vyakti jo sirf 2006 main hi congress main aayaa, aise vyakti yani siddharmaiya ke liye rajya memparty or sarkaarper puraa dabadabaa banaae rakhana, kam badi uplabdhi nahin he
 He was also in such a situation when opponents from many sides were attacking him
 agar siddharmaiya 15 may ko nattejey aane par congress ko bahumat dilaane main samarth rahete hai to nishchit rup se unka kad congress main rahul or sonia gandhi ke baad tisare sabase mahatvapurn netaa ke taur par ubharegaa
 His close friends in the Chief Minister's team claim that if Siddaramaiah had done the work he had done in a state like UP, he would have become a natural contender for the post of Prime Minister as a strong CM with a good track record of governance

 How effective is the Modi factor under Vindhya? Many political experts have been predicting that Modi factor will not be more effective than Vindhya
 wo galat hai
 Barring what the BJP thinks, the internal feedback of the Congress is also saying that in the last phase of the election campaign in Karnataka, Prime Minister Modi has been successful in influencing the voters of 18 to 25 age group
 ye congress ke thinkatank ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 Karnataka has 65 lakh voters from this age group
 ye rajya ke kul matadaataaon kaa 13 fisadi he
 In modern Indian politics, PM Modi's ability to turn voters is no match
 haalanki bijepi netaa bhi maanate hai ki anuwaad karte vakt raajnneetik sandesh kaa kuch hissaa kho jaataa he lekin iske baavjood bijepi ke tarkash main piem modi hi akele brahmastra hai
 Even after the completion of four years of Modi government, there is no effect of anti-incumbency on Brand Modi
 unki vyaktigat apil ab bhi waisi hi he jaise ki pradhanmantri daftar kaa charge lete samay thi
 Probably no major democracy in the world has a leader who turns every election into political acceptance on the performance of his government and impresses the voters in the same way as Modi does

 As the BJP worries about Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has improved its game, the way Rahul Gandhi has started taking practical decisions out of the line of idealism, the BJP has started worrying that Madhya Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh will come later this year
 What will happen in Rajasthan? rajasthan main, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje party adhyaksh amit shah ke saath yuddh main isliye uljhi hai ki koun rajya main party kaa adhyaksh banegaa
 While Shah is batting for Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Raje has handed over his choice
 bijepi kaa andruni akalan kahata he ki rajasthan main mukhyamantri ke khilaaf baari satta virdohi rujhaan kaam kar rahaa he
 And if immediate remedial steps are not taken, the party will face a big defeat in the state
 vahiin raaje is tarah ke prayaason ko apni sarkaar ko kamatar aankane ke taur par dekhati hai
 Now that the elections in Rajasthan are only six months away, the BJP faces the Bhagirath challenge in the state
 madhyapradesh ko lekar bijepi ummid kar rahi thi ki rahul gandhi vahaan congress ke campagne kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke liye apane dost jyotiraditya sindhiya kii niyukti karenge
 But instead Rahul chose Kamal Nath
 camel nath ko raajnneeti kaa chatur khilaadi mana jaataa he
 He also specializes in gimmick sports in which the bjp's top leadership is considered unmatched
 camel nath ke paas wo sansaadhan bhi hai jo dhardaar campagne ko chalaane ke liye aavashyak maane jate hai
 This development has also made things difficult for the BJP in Madhya Pradesh
 jabaki bijepi ko ab bhi madhya pradesh main jeet kii ummid he
 But the party's top leadership believes that if there is a clever operator in the contest, then the three-term anti-incumbency can be dealt with only if its performance is taken to a very high level
 party ummid karti he ki madhya pradesh chunaav corporate banaam kisaan kii jang main tabdeel ho jaae
 Where Kamal Nath is presented as a cherished eye of the corporate eye and Shivraj Singh Chauhan as the humble son of the earth
 aisa dharti putr jisane rajya main kisaanon kii behatari ke liye bahut kuch kiya

 2019: ekajute vipaksh ke saamne hogi brand modi kii asli pariksharecord par, bijepi netaaon kaa daawa he ki uttar pradesh main mayawati or akhilesh ke saath aane se 2019 ke aam chunaavon main party kii sambhaavnaaon ke liye koi vaastavik khatra nahin he
 But privately, party leaders believe that the 2019 fight with opposition forces will be more difficult than it was supposed to be
 2014 main, bijepi ne upi jaise rajyon main badi jeet hasil kii thi kyonki bahukoniya mukaable main vipakshi vot bant gaye the
 The BJP is now hoping that the aunt and nephew pair face difficulties in implementing their alliance on the ground
 party yah bhi guna-bhaag karti he ki muslim vot jahaan espi-bispi gathbandhan ke paksh main jutenge, vahiin samaajawaadee party ko apane yadav voton ko basapa ummidavaaron ko shift karnaa mushkil lagegaa
 Similarly, BSP will find it difficult to transfer their remaining non-jatav vote bank in favor of SP candidates
 bihar chunaav se pehle bijepi kaa sheersh netritv use puranic yuddh kii tarah bataata tha jisamen ek taraf bijepi kii sena or duusari taraf samoochaa ekajute vipaksh
 The bjp's top leadership thought that the organizational skills of Modi and Shah would get them more than 50 per cent of the vote in the state, but the party leadership is more cautious since the reverse results for the BJP in Bihar
 bijepi ummid kar rahi he ki hindi belt main use agar koi nuksaan hota he to uski bharpai nae kshetron se kar legi
 In the end, everything will depend on the brand Modi
 kya matadaataaon kaa bahumat sarkaar ke paanch saal ke kaamkaaj ke aadhaar par modi ko duusare kaarykaal ke liye mauka degaa

 bijepi or jedies main gupt samjhautabijepi or jedies ke bich karnataka main gathbandhan kii sambhaavna kaa jahaan tak sawaal he to bijepi virodhabhasi sanket de rahi he
 At the same time, the allegations of any kind of alliance with the BJP are being dismissed by the JDS
 haalanki jamini str par yah din ke ujaale kii tarah dikh rahaa he bijepi or jedies ranneetik saajhedaari ke tahat kaam kar rahi hai
 This synergy is clearly visible in parts of Old Mysore, especially in southern Karnataka
 bijepi ne un siton par kamjor ummidavaar utaare hai jahaan jedies ummidavaar congress ko haraane kii behatar sthiti main najar aa rahe hai
 Though the BJP is expecting a majority on its own in Karnataka, it has already started the ground work to materialize the possibility of an alliance with the JDS if it stays away from the majority
 udhar congress bhi jedies ummidavaaron tak sthaneey diggaj netaaon jaise ki karnataka ke urja mantri dike sivakumar or purv jedies diggaj siem ibrahim ke jariye sampark bana rahi he
 The Congress hopes that if it is needed on 15 May, there will be no problem in bringing it with them
 jedies netaa or purv mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ke prati apni khunnas dikhaane main parhez nahin karte
 Kumaraswamy is of the firm view that there is no possibility of any coordination with the Congress until it is brought up from Siddaramaiah
 congress main aise kuch netaa he jo ummid lagaae baithe hai ki agar congress bahumat se dur rahati he to unhen jedies ke saath gathbandhan kii sthiti main khud mukhyamantri banane kaa mauka mil saktaa he

 ab bijepi ko apana game ooncha karne kii jarurat2009 loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke kuch arse baad hi congress ne rashtriya paridrishy par niyantran kho diya tha or phir ise kabhi dobaaraa waapas paane kii sthiti main nahin dikhi
 The ridicule of the Congress government on social media continued to fly and Rahul Gandhi was condemned as Pappu
 congress aisi sthiti se paar paane main kuch nahin kar sakati thi, lekin beete ek saal se congress ne naatakeey dhang se apane media game ko upar uthaaya he
 Randeep Surjewala and Divya Spandana have done a good job in carrying out media and social media operations for the party
 ab ye baat alag he ki donon kii aapas main patari zyada nahin baithti
 The Congress has now come to the conclusion that the attack is the only defense and the only way to fight the modi-shah duo is that the party is constantly in attack mode
 beshak kuch hamale badha chadha kar kiye gaye hon
 The Congress argues in defense that this stance is exactly what the BJP did with the Congress
 isliye congress usee kii style main ab bhugtan kar rahi he
 By adopting such a stance of the Congress, the bjp's social media edge has been hidden
 mote taur par ab donon partiyaan vahaan barabari kii jang par hai
 Though BJP leaders are still more popular than Congress leaders, the Congress has managed to set the agenda on several occasions
 pehle yah congress thi, jise apane soshal media game ko durust karne ke liye madad kii jarurat lagati thi
 But now BJP feels the need to elevate their skills on the social media front before the 2019 elections
 tabhi wo is morche par apni badhat barkaraar rakhane kii ummid kar sakati he
 The BJP leadership now says that social media does not turn to election and it is only useful in shaping the narrative on the media

 sachin se ulat saurav maanate hai ki ekadivasiy cricket kaa maujuuda formet upyukt he or yah aage bhi safal rahegaa

 The World Cup has been very successful
 haal hi main bharat or england ke bich kheli gai shrinkhalaa se bhi sabit ho chukaa he ki 50 over kaa formet safal he

 Tendulkar did this with a view to popularizing the format and balancing the advantages of the team winning the toss
 ise lekar isisi kaa kahana tha ki ekadivasiy cricket kaa maujuuda formet pehle se hi lokapriy he, aise main isamen philhal badlaav kii koi sambhaavna nahin

 The Maoists claim that they are fighting for the rights of poor villagers, but they are also accused of intimidating people, extorting money and taking the entire village under their control

 So far this year 123 security personnel have been killed in 53 explosions of landmines
 yah bhayaavah jaankaree is soochna ke saath aa rahi he ki maovadi uttar-purv ke baagiyon ke saath haath milaane ja rahe hai
 Needless to say, this further complicates security challenges
 isse nibatane ke liye 70,000 ardhsainik balon ko tainaat kiya gaya he
 Most of them are proficient in the techniques of forest fighting, guerilla warfare and suppressing rebellion
 in balon ko kendriya aarakshi police bal (siarpief), bharat-tibet seemaa police, seemaa suraksha bal (biguef), sashastr seemaa bal, commando batalian for rijolute ection (cobra) or nagaland armd police se liya gaya he
 These forces have been deployed in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh
 helicopteron ke istemaal ke alaava upgrah ke jariye ugravadiyon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhana bhi is ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 No one has the right to take up law and order, there will be a need for the cooperation of the State Governments for a comprehensive level of security campaign as well as for equitable development

 This may be indicative of some shortcomings in the pace of development
 ham us pahalu kii ore bhi dekh rahe hai lekin kuch logon or samoohon ko kanoon or vyavastha ko apane haath main lene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Initial successes in the campaign, Maoists propagate their principles by taking advantage of poverty and backwardness and control the area
 yahi vajah he ki ve un kshetron ke sthaneey logon kaa vyapak samarthan bator lete hai jin kshetron par ve rajya-vyavastha ko darkinar karke apni satta chalaate hai
 They take no time to capitalize on rural discontent on the displacement issue arising out of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and lay the groundwork for themselves
 haal hi main centre ne induvar jaise logon kii jaghanya hatya ke khilaaf prachaar abhiyaan chalaa kar aise prayaason ko bhothra karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The massive public outcry and the reaction of his family to the murder of Induvar has become an effective weapon to tell the government that the Maoists are nothing but heartless killers
 iske alaava kuch shuruaati sainya safaltaaen bhi haath lagi hai
 In September, a team composed of Cobra Battalion, Chhattisgarh Police and local tribal policemen destroyed illegal arms-making bases in Kishtaram and Chinta Cave area in Dantewada area of south Chhattisgarh in a fierce encounter with 200 militants
 is hamale main 40 maovadi or chah surakshakarmi maare gaye lekin isse bhi adhik mahatvapurn yah he ki pehali baar suraksha bal chintaa gupha tak pahunche
 This area, considered a refuge of the Maoists, seemed to be out of reach due to landmines
 is abhiyaan ke mahatvapurn hone kii ek vajah or he, vah yah ki isse sambandhit rajyon se jis sahyog kii apeksha kii jaati he, vah is baar najar aayaa
 Due to the lack of such cooperation, anti-maoist campaigns have failed so far
 chintaa gupha abhiyaan ke safal hone kii vajah yah bhi thi ki padosi rajyon andhra pradesh or orissa main police bal tainaat the jo ugravadiyon ke ek se duusare rajya jane kii raah main baadha bane
 This trick of the militants is quite old
 adivasee ilaakon ko mukhyadhara se jodne kii koshishaiske alaava haal hi main cobad ghandi or chhatradhar mahato jaise mahatvapurn maovadi netaaon kii giraftaar ke jawaab main induvar hatyakand or gatchiroli jaise vibhats candon ko anjaam diya gaya
 This forced the Center to start its offensive operations ahead of time
 helicopteron ke jariye nigaraanee or behatar talmail ke boote suraksha balon ne jaldi hi us kshetra ko apane kabje main le liya or ugravadiyon ko unke garh jangal se baahar khaded diya
 It also made it clear that better courage and detailed war planning are ultimately proving very useful for the security forces
 dantewada ke police adheekshak amaresh mishra kehete hai, ''dakshin bastar main ugravadiyon ke paanv jamaane ke baad ab hamaare suraksha bal pehali baar singhnamdugu main pravesh kar sake hai
 "actually the plan is to open the forest paths connecting the tribals
" yah maovadi prabhaav vaale ilaake main naagarik prashasan kii bahaali ke liye kii ja rahi kavayad he, to dakshin bastar ke jangalon ko mukt karne kii disha main pehla kadam bhi
 The Special DG is in the hands of the campaign to intensify the offensive, in fact, is a beginning for the security forces as 2009 has been a very terrible year in the death of Maoist violence
 is hinsa main hui maut kaa aankada jammu-kashmir or uttar-purv main hui kul maut ke aankade se bhi adhik he
 In the 1,450 incidents of Maoist violence, 600 people have lost their lives till September this year and 250 security personnel have been killed
 ab suraksha bal upgrah se praapt tasveeron or jameen par unki pushti se talmail bithaate hue apane suvyavasthit, sangathit abhiyaan chalaakar badi badhat lene kii yojana bana rahe hai
 This intensive campaign is to be carried out in the dense forests of Abujhmad in Bastar, which is the central guerrilla base of the Maoists and where its important workers and resources have made their most important destination

 This is a long-term plan, in which states and the central government will have to give more support by implementing the long pending police reforms
 iske liye rajyon ko pi
 It has to be done according to Chidambaram's plan
 abhiyaan kii safalataa par pad saktaa he asardurbhaagya se naksali hinsa se sarvaadhik prabhavit jharkhand, orissa or pashchim bengal main rajnatik or police avadharanaon main bhinnata he

 In Odisha, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik blamed the central government for not giving money for modernization of its police force or for not deploying CRPF and Cobra commandos in large numbers
 chidambaram kaa kahana he ki centre ne police bal ke aadhunikeekaran ke liye rajyon ko 1,250 karod ru
 Allocated lekin is maamle main matbhed to spasht hai or ye bhay tathaa pralobhan ke centre ke abhiyaan ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 The Maoists have also been moving between Jharkhand and West Bengal due to the loose administration
 lalgarh cond ke peeche ek vajah makapa prashasan kii naakaamiyaan to hai hi, duusari vajah yah bhi he ki ugravadi badi sahajata se jharkhand main chale jate rahe hai
 Apart from these, the dilemma of the West Bengal government is also responsible for the Left Wing Extremism
 na sirf maovadi hamale jaan-maal kii adhik haani kar rahe hai, balki lalgarh par kabja jamaane ke baad unke hausale or buland ho gaye hai
 This is the most domineering performance of his strength

 Only Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have given priority to take possession of Maoist-affected areas and have started development work in them

 iske alaava sarkaar naksal prabhavit kshetron ko behatar chikitsa, swasthya, shiksha or bagwani kii suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kii disha main prayasarat he
 Chidambaram's strategy is mainly based on lessons learned from these states, where there has been a reduction in insurgency
 ab khatra yah he ki yadi vanchiton ke sampurna vikaas ke mudde kii or adhik samay tak upeksha kii gai to maovadi apni gatividhiyon ko or tej kar sakate hai
 Pending cases are also required to be disposed of
 The years-long negligence of the State Governments in the appointment of judges in the special courts set up to deal with the matters relating to the land of the tribals is rendering the purpose for which the courts were set up 
 is tarah dashakon se peedit logon ko nyaay nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Only two of the eight courts set up to handle tribal land matters have judges and a total of 40,000 cases are pending
 aisi udaseenta tathaa prashasnic naakaami or vanchiton kii jaruraton ke prati sarkari samvedanheenata sabhi rajyon main vyaapt he
 The objective of such a multi-pronged strategy to deal with the Maoists is to give the security forces the strength they need
 lekin diwaali ke baad shuru hone vaale bade abhiyaan ke baad hi tasviir saaf ho paaegi
 Chidambaram is the right person for the right job, but a campaign that continues for a long time and with the right synergy can give the expected results
 iske liye rajyon ke bich paryaapt sahyog kii jarurat padegi, is tathy ke maddenjar aisi apeksha oonchi hi lagati he
 Recently Maoists have increased violent incidents
 lekin utsahvardhak baat yah he ki pichley saptaah hue vidhansabha chunaav main gatchiroli main maovadi khatre ke baavjood 70 fisadi matdaan hua
 The Prime Minister has said that there will be positive news about the Maoist problem in the next three months, which means that the strategy deadline has also been set

 But he has left many secrets behind him
 or inhen main se ek he uski haveli
 The mansion of Osama, the mansion which is neither in the caves of the mountains nor in any isolated area
 balki ye haveli bani he pakistan army academy ke bilkul seene par
 The needles of this watch have stopped at half past one and this is the time when a very mysterious incident took place in a very mysterious kothi in Attabad, Pakistan
 amaavas kii kaali andheri raat main uthe sholay chhatne ke baad din ke ujaale main aasapaas ke logon ko ye imaarat bilkul nayi lag rahi thi jise wo paanch saal se roj dekh rahe the
 He could not believe that the world's most dangerous terrorist used to run his own Nizam from within the building
 par ye sachai he ki osama bin laden pichley paanch saal se isi ghar main band tha
 While the US was scouting for him in the hills of Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden was sitting in Pakistan's mehfuz Abbottabad
 laal rang kii car main savaar hokar mahaj ek shaks hi ghar se nikalataa tha or haveli ke bheetar rahane vaale logon kaa ilaake ke kisi shaks se koi raftaa nahin tha
 And when the doors of this house opened to the world, the whole world trembled
 construction company chalaane vaale osama bin laden ke liye ye ghar behad itmeenaan se banaaya gaya tha
 There was a machine in front of which a picture of the person standing in front of the house is shown to the people sitting inside the house and a speaker inside the house is attached to the mike in the plastic box which allows the outside sounds to go inside
 laden kii behad surakshit imaarat kaa ye pehla saboot he
 If permission was obtained from here, this iron gate that was closed now would open and the man would find himself standing in a corridor
 or jab wo galiyara khatm hota tha to ek or lohe kaa get miltaa tha jo ki ek angannuma jagah par khulata tha or usee angan se is mukhya imaarat ke liye rasta tha
 Any person who entered this house was equal to the third floor of the house
 or osama is ghar kii teesri manzil main hi rahata tha
 That is, Osama used to keep an eye on everything
 jis ghar main osama chipa tha uski deevaaren doharin thim or dono deevaaron ke bich main ek khaas tarah kaa fom or kuch duusari chijen bhari gayin thim
 It is believed that this can be a way to make the building soundproof and bulletproof
 is imaarat ke chaaro ore sisitivi camere lage the jinka control room sidhe osama ke paas tha or sisitivi bhi yun lagaae gaye the jo is puri imaarat kaa har konaa cover rakhte the
 Cheating ceilings were built inside the building and one such false ceiling was also discovered by American commanders during the attack
 raat ke vakt ghar kii suraksha ke liye chaaro ore or khaskar get par raushnee ke pukhta intjaam kiye gaye the
 There were electric lamps around the entire house
 osama ke is ghar main ek do nahin kai tivi set the or ye thode puraane tareeke ke the par in par tasviren dikhaane kaa jariya behad nayaa tha
 DTH umbrella on the roof of the house
 yani osama bin laden yaa phir uske saath ke log baraabar tivi setus ke jariye baahar kii duniya se jude rahete the
 Laden was a sick man
 lihaaja uski or ghar main rahane vaale logon kii suvidha ke liye spilit asi bhi lagaae gaye the jinaki kooling unit baahar hoti he or thandi hawa bina zyada shor ke andar kamare main jaati thi
 In this place of Osama, vegetables were cultivated by making green houses in a very modern way in the vacant land
 green house cover to hat gaya he par iskaa dhaancha ab bhi vahiin he
 Vegetables were also grown in the bungalow
 kheton ke kinare kinare ganje ke paudhe badi taadaad main mili hai
 Osama bin Laden kept a cow, a buffalo sail inside the house for the milch children
 iske alaava do khargosh mili hai or ek kutta bhi
 a large number of cricket balls have also been found in Osama's house
 ye gende pados ke bacchon kii hai jo agar ghar ke bheetar chali jaatin thim to baahar nahin aati thim
 Instead of this, children were given hundred to one hundred fifty rupees at the gate
 osama ke ghar ke bheetar kapade kii gathriyon main badi taadaad main gande kapade mili hai aisa lagata he jaise saalon se kapade ikattha kiye gaye hon
 It seems that Osama did not throw away his used clothes and did not finish them, then only these clothes were gathered in large numbers here
 vaise kaha jaataa he ki osama apane ghar ke kooday ko baahar nahin phenkata tha ghar ke bheetar hi jala detaa tha
 But still there was a lot of garbage in his house
 osma kii kothi main phone nahin the, koi internet conection nahin tha, lekin aisa nahin he ki osama aaj kii technology se maharoom tha
 The evidence of Osama's high-tech also came from this mansion
 americanyon ke mutabik laden suraksha ke liye kisi aisi takneekee kaa istemaal nahin karata tha jise tres kiya ja sake
 But US security agencies have found 10 hard drives, 5 computers, more than 100 storage devices from within Waziristan Kothi
 iske alaava oparation ke baad jab laden kii talaashi lee gayi to uske kapade ke bheetar do phone number mili the
 There were 50 euros in the pocket
 is tarah se duniya kaa sabase bada aatanki soochna ke liye wo tamaam aadhunik chijen istemaal main laata tha jo aaj aadhuniktaa kaa pratik maani jaati he
 But Osama used to take care that he was neither connected to the internet nor his frequency could be captured
 laden kaa ye teen manjila makaan do hajaar gaj main bana hua tha
 This house had a total of 11 rooms, it had 4 rooms in the first floor, the second floor also had 4 rooms, the third floor had three rooms
 ghar ke bheetar thim sari seedhiyaan, oonchi deevaaron se ghiri balakani
 Osama bin Laden was shot to death in front of his daughter and wife's eyes in the third floor of this very large house
 osama ke aatank kaa thikaana jis thanda choha ilaake main bana tha uske ird-gird zyaadaatar afgaan mul ke log rahete the
 Even though he had nothing to do with the local people, this is important because Laden, who had grown a crop of terror throughout his life in Afghanistan, trusted him only
 laden kii is haveli main badi taadaad main dawaaen mili hai
 As everyone knows, Laden's kidneys were defective and needed equal dialysis
 ghar ke bheetar mili ek passport se pataa chalata he ki ek yaman mul kii mahila doctor uske saath pichley paanch saal se rah rahi thi jo uski biviyon main se ek thi
 Apart from this, a large number of religious books have been found in Laden's house, which may have been useful for the children living in the house or the reading of Laden
 osama kii haveli kisi tilism se kam nahin thi
 Hardly anyone from outside knows anything about this mansion
 lekin andar bas yun samaj lijie jaise ki koi bhul-bhulaiya ho
 Osama's life was full of secrets, his mansion is filled with more than that
 is makaan ko baahar se dekhne par bas oonchi-oonchi deevaaren hi dikhengi
 What is inside - no one knows anything
 baahar se koi chaahakar bhi andar ke halaat ko nahin dekh saktaa
 In the building that stands on the other side of this border of walls, Osama lived in the world's biggest terrorist
 in deevaaron ke peeche aatank kaa ek samrajya tha
 You will be surprised to see how many special measures Osama bin Laden had taken to stay safe in this mansion
 bangale kii diwaar kaa kuch hissaa 12 feet ooncha he
 This height increases after a short distance
 kahin diwaar he 18 feet kii
 Where there is this wall of 18 feet, there are some rooms
 jahaan andar ke kamare kaa construction khatm hota he, vahaan kii diwaar kii oonchai phir kam ho jaati he
 To some extent, this wall is 13 feet high
 ye diwaar aage sidhi bhi jaati he or andar kii taraf mud bhi jaati he
 The wall that turns inward has a height of 11 feet
 jis ahaate main osama bin laden ke rahane ke liye timanjila imaarat bani hui he, wo chaaron ore se deevaaron se ghiri hui he
 The height of a wall adjacent to the gate is 12 feet
 jis hisse se osama kaa lenaa-dena kam tha, us hisse kii diwaar kii oonchai 10 feet he
 Gate number one
 is get ke baad shuru hoti he ek lambii gali
 On the other side of the street are 12 feet high wall
 lambii gali ke baad aayega get number do
 But even after passing this door, he could not get close to Laden
 kyonki yahaan ke baad aapako ek or chote get se nikalnaa padataa
 Osama bin Laden had made special arrangements to stay in this Tilismi fort
 get number ek par laga tha camera or microphone, jo har aane vaale kaa cheharaa or aawaaj pard letaa tha
 On coming in from gate number one, the entire street could be seen from the second and third floors of the house
 iske alaava makaan kii khidkiyaan aisi thim, jiske andar se baahar kii har harakat par najar rah sakati thi
 But nothing was seen from outside
 makaan dikhne se behad aam dikhataa tha
 Common looking walls
 aam se hi dikhne vaale is makaan ke andar osama is puri taiyaari ke saath rahata tha ki kisi ko isaki bhanak bhi nahin thi
 Guess the strength of the walls of this fort of Osama that the helicopter crashed and there was just a crack in the wall
 koi duusari diwaar rahati to naa jane uskaa kya haal hota
 But Osama had made special arrangements to build these walls and houses
 deevaaron main lagi thi cement kii inten
 The walls were made of double layer
 diwaar kii do eenton ke bich fom or duusari dhaatu bhari hui thim
 Meaning these walls were made bulletproof in a way
 ye osama bin laden kaa makaan tha
 The same Osama who ran the construction company
 jaahir he ye khaas taur par to banaaya hi gaya tha
 There are many more secrets inside this mysterious house
 aatank matlab osama, osama matlab aatank
 The name by which the terror also trembles, but Seal 6 Commandos also saw a new face of Osama in this mansion

 On Thursday, there is a clash between two teams in the IPL who do not have a shortage of stars
 lekin donon tiimon main star khilaadiyon kii bharmaar ke hone ke baavjood dilli apni ballebaazi ko lekar toornament main bedam nazar aa rahi he, to mumbai ke gendbaaz ekadam fike dikh rahe hai
 By the way, in terms of records in the IPL, there has been an equal competition between the two teams
 donon tiimon ke bich ab tak hue 14 muqaabalon main donon tiimon ke naam 7-7 match hai
 That is, the bump is forked
 pichley sizan sirf do jeet hasil karne vaali dilli kii takkar purv champion mumbai se he
 The competition is going to be on Ferozeshah Kotla, so Delhi will definitely get some benefit of being a home team
 lekin toornament main dilli ko abtak paanch main se do, jabaki mumbai ko paanch main se ek match main jeet hasil hui he
 However, four-five batsmen from Delhi have scored in different matches
 team bataur team ek saath bahut kam chali
 The time has come for top order batsmen like Yuvraj Singh (5 match-120 runs), captain JP Duminy (5 match-129 runs) and Manoj Tiwari (32 runs in 2 innings of 4 matches) to show their true strength to win
 
 varanaa bahut der ho jaaegi
 Young batsmen Shreyas Iyer (5 matches -144 runs), and opener Mayank Agarwal (5 matches-122 runs) have impressed everyone with their talent
 dilli ke fans unase badi ummiden karenge
 At least four bowlers from Delhi have been scoring runs at less than 8 runs per over
 ipel main sabase kamaal ke form main chal rahe imran taahir (5 match 10 wicket), jepi dumini (5 match 7 wicket) or nathan coolter nile (5 match 5 wicket) jaise gendbaaz ek baar phir dilli kaa dil jeet sakate hai
 The former champions Mumbai team, which has won one of the 5 matches, would like to sign a win on the pitch of the opposition team like the previous match
 mumbai ke ballebaazon ne ab tak 9 ardhshtkeey paariyaan kheli hai or toornament main ab tak 40 se zyaada chakke lagaae hai

 This time due to the Asian Games released in Jakarta, the dates of the Khel Ratna and Arjuna Award ceremony have been changed
 ab yah samaaroh agle maheene hoga
 Dhyanchand's achievements come a long way
 The journey of Dhyanchand, who won India's hockey gold medal in the three-olympic (1928 Amsterdam, 1932 Los Angeles and 1936 Berlin), brings glory to Indian sports history
 unke jeevat kaa har koi kaayal rahaa
 a memorable account of his playing life takes Indian hockey to the pinnacle
 berlin alampic ke final kaa wo vakya -darasal, berlin alampic ke hockey kaa final bharat or germany ke bich 14 agast 1936 ko khelaa janaa tha
 But due to continuous rain that day, the match was played the next day on 15 August
 berlin ke hockey stadium main us din 40 hajaar darshakon ke bich hitler bhi maujuud the
 By half time India were ahead by one goal
 iske baad dhyanchand ne apane spike vaale juute nikaale or khaali paanv kamaal kii hockey kheli
 After this, India scored several goals in succession
 saathi daara ne ek sansmaran main aisa likhaa -1936 ke berlin olympic main unke saath khele or baad main pakistan ke captain bane ienes daara ne ek sansmaran main likhaa- chah gol khaane ke baad german kaaphi kharaab hockey khilne lage
 His goalkeeper Tito Warnholtz's hockey stick hit Dhyanchand's mouth so hard that he broke his tooth
 german team ko aise sikhaaya sabakpraarambhik upachaar ke baad ground par lautne ke baad dhyanchand ne khilaadiyon ko nirdesh die ki ab koi gol na maaraa jaae, german khilaadiyon ko ye bataaya jaae ki gend par niyantran kaise kiya jaataa he
 After this, the players would repeatedly take the ball to Germany's d and then pass the ball back
 german khilaadiyon kii samaj main hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki ye ho kya rahaa he
 
 
 
 us haar kaa badla chukayabharat ne us final main germany ko 8-1 se maat di
 Dhyanchand scored three goals in this
 darasal, 1936 ke olympic khel shuru hone se pehle ek abhyaas match main bhartiya team germany se 4-1 se haar gai thi
 Dhyanchand wrote in his autobiography 'gol', 'I will never forget this defeat till i live
 is haar ne hamen itnaa hilaa kar rakh diya ki ham puri raat so nahin paae
 Hitler also bluntly said, Happy in India, it is said that happy with this great performance, Hitler invited him to eat and asked him to play for Germany
 iske badale unhen majboot german sena main karnal pad kaa pralobhan bhi diya
 But Dhyanchand said, 'hindustan is my homeland and i am happy there
 'facts--chunki dhyaan singh raat main bahut abhyaas karte the, isliye unhen apane saathi khilaadiyon dwaara upnaam 'chand' diya gaya
 Actually, his practice started when the moon came out
 -aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi kimager dhyanachandko bachapan main hockey nahin, kushti se zyada lagaav tha
 -one time he said- If someone asked me which was the best match i played, i would say the 1933 Beton Cup final between Calcutta Customs and Jhansi Heroes
 -bharat ne 1932 ke olympic ke dauraan america ko 24-1 or japan ko 11-1 se haraaya
 Dhyanchand scored 12 of those 35 goals, while his brother Roop Singh scored 13 goals
 isse unhen 'hockey kaa judawaan' kaha gaya
 - Once Dhyanchand could not score goals during a match, he objected to the goal post measurement
 aakhirkaar ve sahi paae gaye
 The goal post was not of the official minimum width prescribed under international regulations
 -22 saal tak bharat ke liye khele or 400 international gol kiye
 It is said that when he used to play, it was as if the ball was stuck on the stick
 holland main ek match ke dauraan chumbak hone kii ashanka main unki stick todakar dekhi gai
 During a match in Japan, his stick was also said to have glue
 -dhyanchand kaa 3 disambar, 1979 ko dilli main nidhan ho gaya
 He was cremated in Jhansi on the same ground where he used to play hockey

 Premium charges apply !! somvaar 30 march ko america ke indiana state main bhartiya mul kii america mahila purvi patel ko kanya bhrunahatya maamle main 20 saal jail kii sazaa sunaane kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 East Patel was accused of not caring for his unborn child, in return for which he was sentenced to 30 years, which was later reduced to 20 years
 maanavadhikaar sanghathanon or pregnant mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye ladaai ladane vaali sanstha ke anusaar desh main garbhpaat nirodhi kanoon kaa istemaal pregnant mahilaon ke kilaaf kiya ja rahaa he
 Patel was arrested in July 2013 when she was at St
 Joseph Regional Medical Center in Mishawaka City and her body was bleeding heavily
 ilaaj ke dauraan purvi ne doctoron ko bataaya ki unka garbhpaat hua he or unhone mrit bhrun ko dustbin main phenk diya
 The court said in favor of Eastern that the fetus was aged 23-24 weeks, but the government lawyer said that the fetus was 25 weeks old and died on birth
 purvi ke lakh kehane ke baad bhi ki usne ek mrit bhrun ko janm diya tha na ki jivit bachche ko, adaalat ne uski baat maanane se inkaar kar diya or usapar ek zindaa bachche kii dekhbhaal thik tarah se nahin karne kaa aarope laga diya
 The court also accused East Patel of ordering online, lethal drugs to kill her unborn child
 haalanki isaki pushti toxicology jaanch main nahin kii ja saki ki unhone un davaaiyon kaa seven kiya tha yaa nahin
 On the eastern side it was also said that she comes from a conservative Indian family where giving birth to a child before marriage is considered a stigma, in such a situation, when she was about to become the mother of her lover's child, she was scared
 state of indiana ke fityside lau ke tahas sazaa paane vaali patel pehali mahila hai, unase pehle chini mul kii bi bi shuaai par cese chalaa tha jab unhone maansik beemaari ke kaaran, pregnancy ke dauraan aatmahatya kii koshish thi
 Although Shuai survived then, her unborn child could not survive
 tab shuaai ko bhi medical sahaayta milane ke bajaay unpar lanbaa cese chalaaya gaya
 Citing the example of both cases, Deepa Iyer, working in the Asian American Department of the University of Maryland, questions that in both cases, it is clear that the women being of Asian descent are being discriminated against in giving justice here
 duusare deshon se yahan ai in pravasi mahilaon ke saath naa sirf unke rang ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he balki unhen wo kanoonee or medical suvidhaayen bhi nahin milti hai jo yahan ke mul nivaasiyon ko milti he
 As such, they are exploited at many levels, which are being done to East Patel
 The Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Laws 2013 kii ek study ke anusaar puure america main pregnant mahilaon ke kilaaf jitne bhi maamle darj kiye hai unamem se 70% garib mahilaayein hai or inamen se 59% ashwet mahilaon ke kilaaf hai
 According to Miriam Yeung of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, these women often do not go to get necessary medical services during pregnancy due to fear of being arrested or imprisoned
 isliye zarurat pregnancy se jude muddon, maansik or shaareerik samasyayon ke bare main asian american community kii mahilaon ko juyada jaagruk karne ke alaava unhen behatar health suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kii he

 BJP leader Vinay Katiyar from Uttar Pradesh said in a sarcastic manner that 'gandhi' has been placed in front of Varun, so perhaps he has been given more importance than necessary

 In order to maintain his political existence after leaving Nitish Kumar in the middle, RJD chief Lalu Yadav will have to win by both time and CBI and prepare a place for his children as his political heir
 unke paas ab bhi turup ke chand ikke maujuud hai
 Lalu was suspecting that something wrong was going to happen
 pashchim bengal ke rajyapal kesharinath treepathi 25 july ko patna pahunche the or usee din bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi dilli main raashtrapati ramnath kovind ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke baad laute the
 Earlier, Nitish had denied Lalu to use his photographs for the Rashtriya Janata Dal rally on August 27
 udhar, rajyapal treepathi kii yah pehali bihar yatra thi jinhen 22 june ko rajya kaa atirikt prabhaar saunpa gaya tha
 Lalu ordered one of his assistants to "know that the Governor is coming
" " usne turant unhen bataaya ki rajyapal uniwarsity ke adhikariyon se milane ke liye aae hai
 Lalu did not get into this thing
 lekin party vidhayakon kii baithak ke aayojan or tejasvi yadav ke istife kaa virodh karne ke liye apana paala majboot karne kii kavayad main unhone is vishay ko zyada tarjeeh nahin di
 Lalu's desire was strongly supported in the RJD meeting
 lekin kuch chijen thim jo baichaiyn kar rahi thim or isi pareshaani main unki 26 july kii 3
 The 30-hour Indigo flight missed the last flight to Ranchi, where he was to appear in the CBI court in connection with the fodder scam the next morning
 supreme court ne may main faisla sunaaya tha ki rajd pramukh ko chaara ghotaale ke sabhi chaar maamalon main alag-alag pesh hona hoga, jisamen jharkhand hycourt ne dhai saal pehle unhen aaropon se mukt kar diya tha
 Then that is what he feared
 us shaam jad (you) kii baithak ke baad ''chote bhai" nitish ne unhen suchit kiya ki ve istipha de rahe hai
 It was the longest night for the RJD chief who was about to pass on the way to Ranchi
 lalu ke saamne kii chunautiyankarib ek dashak se lambey samay tak haashie par rahane ke baad november 2015 main rajd ko bihar ke rajnatik manch par phir se kendriya sthaan paane kaa anand mila tha
 Now his hands and feet are swollen because today there is no one in his family whose support he can throw his dice like before
 chaara ghotaale main fanse hone kii vajah se ve khud chunaav nahin lard sakate, patni rabari ek tarah se ritair ho chuki hai or unke nau bacchon main se teen, jinhen apni rajnatik viraasat kii mashaal saunpane kii yojana unhone banaai thi—tejpratap, tejasvi, jo unke uttaradhikari maane jate hai or sabase badi beti misa bharti—aaj sibiai, iskar vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay (idi) kii ore se unke khilaaf darj maamalon ke chakravyuuh main ulajh chuke hai
 He is the leader of the single largest party in the state with 80 members in the 243-strong Bihar assembly
 dilachasp baat he ki jab 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main rajd ko karaari haar kaa saamana karte hue 22 se 4 siton par hi santosh karnaa padaa tha, tab bhi lalu kaa kosh 47 lakh voton se bharaa tha jo bihar main hue kul matdaan kaa kareeb 19
 Was 3 percent
 phir, 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab rajd 22 siton kii apni sabase kam sankhya par aa giri thi tab bhi unhen 55 lakh vot mili the
 In 2014, Lalu added around 1,80,000 votes with 72 lakh votes, although he won just four seats
 lalu kaa muslim-yadav vot sameekaran hameshaa ek majboot vot bank rahaa he, lekin iske jariye jeet nahin hasil hui
 Lalu will also need other castes on his victory chariot
 ve usee disha main kaam kar rahe hai
 Even before he left Nitish, Lalu was trying to bring BSP leader Mayawati into his court and offered to send him to Rajya Sabha from Bihar to woo the Dalit votes
 rajd netaaon kaa maananaa he ki nitish ke endie kii ore badhate kadamon se sattarudh gathbandhan main ''bheed" badhati dikh rahi he, jisase unki jati ke kuch netaa lalu ke shivi main aa sakate hai
 Lalu is interested in bringing Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, the leader of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP), who is against the Hindustani Awam Morcha of Nitish and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi
 bihar main endie ke sahyogi aralaisi or hindustani avam morcha ko nitish kii nai cabinet main koi pratinidhitiv nahin mila he
 As Lalu and his children are caught up in a legal battle, they will hardly have time to discuss the challenge of nitish-bjp alliance
 mana ja rahaa he ki chaara ghotaale main unhen jail janaa pad saktaa he
 "when the CBI filed a case against Lalu in the fodder scam, in 1995," says a senior RJD legislator, he took to the road and drew immense public support
 lekin, aaj lalu ke paas vaisaa samarthan nahin he, na hi vipareet paristhitiyon ko sanbhaalane ke liye pehle jaisi sehat or urja
 "lalu had a heart operation in 2014
 lalu ke saamne mushkilon kaa pahaad khadaa he, centre sarkaar ke saath to pehle se hi vair chal rahaa tha, ab patna main bhi ek bairee sarkaar sattarudh ho chuki he
 The concern of the RJD supremo is legitimate
 is niraashajanak paridrishy main congress lalu ke saath he
 Therefore, for Lalu, the national party is more important for strategic reasons than elections
 loksabhaa main bihar main kul 40 siton main congress ko bhale do siten hi milin ho, lekin bhaajapa ke mukchay pratidwandvi ke rup main uske paas muslim vot kii badi sankhya maujuud he
 The fate of jail: Spending a month in connection with jail has always been politically beneficial for Lalu
 apatkaal ke dauraan kuch samay jail main bitaane ke baad hi 1977 main unhone apana loksabhaa chunaav jeeta
 He has been jailed seven times since he surrendered in July 1997 in fodder scam cases
 1997 main jail se chhootane ke baad ve hathi par chadhakar ghar laute the
 In 2001, when he surrendered before the CBI court in Ranchi, he took a convoy of thousands of cars with him
 unhone apane vot bank ko ekajute karne ke liye nyaayik hiraasat kaa jamkar istemaal kiya
 It is okay that there is no reduction in Lalu's boasting, Lalu's first priority is to make the August 27 rally successful so that he can tell that he is still a force that cannot be ignored
 janatantr ko sirf kanoon nahin bachaa sakate
 It is these lawyers and judges who inspire the respect of law

 And now the finger is being pointed at his own court: Should the Supreme Court interfere in the field of policy-making? No one else understands this better than the Chief Justice, because in a short period of nine months — by 26 April 2014 — there are decisions coming before his court that can change the face of elections and democracy

 After this, the speech war started

 Jaitley says, "we need a variety of judicial reforms to bring transparency and honesty
 niyuktiyon se lekar bhrashtachar ke aarope or jajon ko hataane jaise kai mudde hai
 According to the solicitor Soli Sorabjee, the root of the problem is that the judges have locked themselves in the cloak of legitimacy, invincibility and secrecy
 bharat main ucch nyaaypalika main jajon kii niyukti jaj khud hi kar lete hai
 It is considered to be omnipotent (the collegium), it is also considered to be the "most intelligence-intensive institution in India"
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 124 or 217 main ucch nyaaypalika ke nyaayadhishon kii niyukti kaa ullekh he
 Sorabji explains: The President of India should appoint other judges with 'advice'
 jajon kii niyukti kaa adhikaar mul rup se karypalika ke haath main he
 But in a series of three rulings (now called the 1981, 1993, and 1998 three-judge cases), this advice has completely turned into a "judgment"
 psorabji kehete hai, “collegium system (aisa system jiske tahat jajon kii niyukti or tabadalon par faisle bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish or supreme court ke chaar sabase senior jaj kii forum karti he
 It is not mentioned in the Indian constitution) developed and the principle of judicial independence meant that no branch of government would have any authority in the appointment of judges
 ”unka yah bhi maananaa he ki ‘nyaaypalika main ashobhaneey saarvajanik chhintakashi’ ke liye yah collegium system hi jimmedaar he
 An example of this is a 10-page letter written by the Chief Justice of Gujarat to the President, Prime Minister and Chief Justice on 19 March
 is patr main purv mukhya nyaayadhish kabir par bhai-bhatijawad kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Sorabji says, “in my 60 years of experience, i have not seen a shoddy point
 
 
 yah meri us manyata ko pukhta karata he ki collegium system ko badal dena chahie
 Government should have a role in this
 ”lekin nyaayik aazaadee ke liye nyaayik swaittata jaruri he
 Even the day Sadasivam became the Chief Justice, he opposed the change of the collegium system: “I accept that it has some flaws
 lekin in khaamiyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 He also said that changing the existing system is within the jurisdiction of the government, but any change can be made only through constitutional amendment or a larger bench of the Supreme Court can consider it
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone do saal ke nishchit kaarykaal ke system kii vakaalat kii he taaki mukhya nyaayadhish nyaayik sudhaaron par faisla kar saken or use lagu kara saken
 Upendra Bakshi, a professor of law at Britain's University of Warwick, says, "there had to be a confrontation between the judiciary and the leaders
 ” 2010 se tej-tarraar jajon ne rashtriya agenda bana liya haih bhrashtachar ke bade maamalon kii sunwaayee, jaanch agenciyon par sawaal or shashan main visangatiyon kaa pardaafash karnaa
 Such judges acted according to the mood of the public
 janata chaahati thi ki oonche str par bhrashtachar ko dur kiya jaae
 However, there was also talk of "uncontrollable judiciary"
 lekin unhone isaki parvaah nahin kii
 Bakshi says, "when legalists start questioning each other's conduct, it is not a good thing for the image of an important democratic institution
 ”mukhya nyaayadhish sadashivam ke netritv main supreme court rajnatik varg par hamale ke maamle main ekajute he—netaaon ko milane vaale bhatton or phaaydon kii ninda karke jaj bakhubi surkhiyaan lut rahe hai

 yah kanoon kisi bhi str ke court dwaara doshi qaraar die gaye saansadon or vidhayakon ko is aadhaar par ayogy qaraar dene se bachaata he ki faisle ke khilaaf hycourt main apil lambit he
 Criminal cases are going on against 1,460 sitting mps and mlas, hence the decision has caused panic in political circles
 rajnatik partiyon ne is maamle par sangathit hokar supreme court par “kanoon banane” kaa aarope lagaaya he or unhone sansad kii sarvocchata kii maang kii he
 Senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani says, "I have no doubt that the government would not like an independent judiciary
" ” pichley do dashakon main nyaayik ayog kaa vichaar kabhi nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 The point of consideration is whether such changes can be brought by parliamentary laws or it will require amendment of the constitution
 agar samvidhan main sanshodhan kii jarurat hui to kya sarkaar ke paas donon sadanon main jaruri bahumat he? yaa is maamle main nyaaypalika kii jeet hogi?sadashivam kaam ke dhuni maane jate hai or der tak kaam karte rahete hai, lekin jaj ke rup main apane kariyar main saamne khadi chunautiyon se nibatane ke liye itnaa hi paryaapt nahin hoga

 This creepy plot starts in Jaffna, Sri Lanka
 november 1990 kaa daur tha
 Prabhakaran, the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was present in an intelligence base amidst dense forests
 uske saath vahaan uske 4 saathi bhi maujuud the
 Baby Subrahmanyam, Muthuraja, Murugan and Sivarasan
 ek badi sajeesh ban rahi thi
 The meeting lasted between hours of tension
 har aadmi apana paksh rakh rahaa tha
 The tension in this meeting was so secret that even the air sounded like the sound of a bomb
 umas or garmi ke bich prabhakaran bahut teji se sun or bun rahaa tha
 Eventually the plot was completed
 prabhakaran ne rajeev gandhi kii maut ke plan par muhar laga di
 The responsibility of completing the plan was entrusted to four people
 baby subrahmanyam-littey idolog, hamalaavaron ke liye thikaane kaa jugad isane kiya tha
 muthuraja-prabhakaran's responsibility was the responsibility of communication and money for the attackers
 murugan-visphotak visheshgy, aatank guru, hamale ke liye jaruri chizon or paise kaa intjaam kiya
 It was the responsibility of the assassination of sivarasan-ltte detective, explosives expert, Rajiv Gandhi
 1991 main shuru hua yojana par kaamaduniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi prabhakaran se rajeev kii hatya kaa farmaan lene ke baad baby subrahmanyam or muthuraja 1991 kii shuruuaat main chennai pahunche
 He was responsible for very important and preliminary work
 baby or muthuraj ko chennai main aise log taiyaar karne the jo makasad se anjaan hote hue bhi deth squyod kii madad karen
 Especially for the killers of Rajiv Gandhi, give them a place to stay before the murder and a hideout after the murder
 alag-alag target par focusababi subrahmanyam or muthuraja chennai main sidhe shubha news photo agency pahunche
 The agency's owner was Shubha Subrahmanyam Illam supporters
 shubha subrahmanyam ke paas donon kii madad kaa paigaam baby or muthuraja ke pahunchane se pehle hi aa chukaa tha
 Shubha had to provide local support for the plot
 yahaan pahunch kar baby or muthuraja ne apane apane target ke mutabik alag-alag kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Bhagyanathan was caught in a trapbabe Subrahmanyam first caught Bhagyanathan, who works at Shubha News Photo Agency, in his clutches
 rajeev hatyakand main sajaa bhugat rahi nalini isi bhagyanathan kii bahan he jo us vakt ek printing press main kaam karti thi
 Bhagyanathan and Nalini's mother was a nurse
 nurse maa ko isi samay aspataal se mila ghar khaali karnaa tha
 Terrorist Baby caught Bhagyanathan and Nalini in difficult circumstances in the guise of money and help
 baby ne ek printing press bhagyanathan ko saste main bech diya
 This saved the family from getting on the road
 badale main nalini or bhagyanathan baby ke pyaade ho gaye
 The first phase of the conspiracy was to create a network of supporters who would be helpful in slowly carrying out the conspiracy locked in vicious minds but without knowing anything
 do photographer chuneek taraf baby subrahmanyam chennai main rahane ke surakshit thikaane bana rahaa tha to muthuraja behad shaatir tareeke se logon ko apni krur sajeesh ke liye chun rahaa tha
 Those working in Chennai's Shubha News Photo Agency became a boon for these devils
 yaheen se muthuraja ne do photographer ravishankaran or haribabu chune
 Muthuraja got Naukrivishankaran and Haribabu both working as photographers in Shubha News Photocopy Agency
 haribabu ko naukari se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Muthuraja got Haribabu a job at Vigyaneshwar Agency
 srilanka se baalan naam ke ek shaks ko bula kar haribabu kaa shagird banaaya
 This led to Haribabu getting a lot of money and his inclination towards Muthuraja
 rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf bhadakaayamuthuraja ne ahsaan ke boj tale dabe haribabu ko rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf khub bhadakaayaa ki agar wo 1991 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kar satta main aae to tamilon kii or durgati hogi
 a brick-and-mortar plot was being planned to assassinate Rajiv
 srilanka main baithe murugan ne is bich jai kumaaran or robert paayas ko chennai bheja
 Both of them stayed at Saviri Nagar Extension in Purur
 purur main chipa tha littey kaa bam export ariveyuyahan jayakumaran kaa jija littey bam export ariveyu perulibalan 1990 se chhip kar rah rahaa tha
 The purpose of sending these two from Sri Lanka to Chennai was to involve longtime computer engineer and electronic expert Ariyveu Perulibalan in the conspiracy so that he could make a murder tool bomb
 aage chalakar porur kaa yahi ghar rajeev gandhi hatyakand ke plan kaa headquarter ban gaya
 It was from here that the whole conspiracy reached Sriperumbudur
 sajeesh main murugan kii entrishatir sutaradhar judane vaale har shaks ke dimag main rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf bheeshan nafrat bhi paidaa kar rahaa tha
 He was aware that without fierce hatred, the horrific plot would not reach its end
 jab baby or muthuraja ne apane apane chaar log jod liye to sajeesh main murugan kii entry hui
 By reaching Chennai, Murugan intensified his efforts to bring the conspiracy to great effect
 murugan ke ishaare par jayakumaran or paayas
 nalini-bhagyanathan-baby-reached Muthuraja's hideout
 rajeev gandhi virdohi bhavanaaen logon ke dimag main bhari jane lageen
 Nalini was fully prepared against Rajiv Gandhi
 'satanik forces' ne brinwash main kii madadnalini jis priting press main naukari karti thi vahaan chap rahi ek kitaab satanik forces ne uske brinwash main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Murugan, along with Brainwash, forged fake driving licenses with the help of Jayakumaran and Pius to create fake identities of the killers
 chhipane ke mahfuj thikanemurugan, muthuraja or baby ne milakar chennai main chhipane ke teen mahfuj thikaane khoj liye
 a bomb maker was ready as Araviu
 rajeev ke khilaaf nafrat se bhare nalini padma or bhagyanathan kii oot taiyaar thi
 a man like Shubha Subrahmanyam was ready to provide
 ab shivarasana ko sandeshaa bheja gaya
 In early March, he reached Chennai by sea
 wo porur ke isi ilaake main paayas ke ghar main rukaa
 The search for the human bomb became the controlroom of the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi
 shivarasana ke porur pahunchate hi jafana ke jangalon kii sajeesh kaa jaal puraa ho gaya
 Sivarasan took over the command
 baby auki muthuraj ko srilanka waapas bhej diya gaya
 In Chennai, Sivarasan along with Nalani, Murugan and Bhagyanathan searched for Manavabam but could not find it
 shivarasana ne ariveyu peruli baalan ke bam kii digaayan ko check kiya, shivarasana khud acha visphotak export tha
 Seeing all the preparations complete, Shivarasan then went back to Jaffna by way of sea in the Itanjam of Manavam, where he met Prabhakaran
 usne prabhakaran ko bataaya ki bharat main maanavbam nahin mil rahaa he
 At this, Prabhakaran sent Sivarasan's cousins dhanu and Shubha to India with him
 teen thikaane, ek hatyakand kii sajishdhanu or shubha ko lekar shivarasana april kii shuruuaat main chennai pahunchaa
 He took Dhanu and Shubha to Nalini's house
 yahaan murugan pehle se maujuud tha
 Sivarasan kept pius-jayakumaran-bomb designer Arivu away from him in a very vicious manner and himself lived in Porur's hideout
 wo samay-samay par sabko sahi karrwai ke nirdesh detaa tha
 Now the conspiracy to kill Rajiv Gandhi was going on in three locations in Chennai
 shivarasana ne target kaa khulaasa kiye bina bam export allivu se ek aisa bam banane ko kaha jo mahila kii qamar main baandha ja sake
 At Sivarasan's behest, Arivu designed a belt in which six rdx-filled grenades could be loaded
 har grenade main assi gram sifor adiex bharaa gaya
 Each grenade has two thousand eight hundred splinter of two millimeters
 saare grenade ko silver taar kii madad se paralal joda gaya
 Two switches were placed to complete the circuit
 aise taiyaar hua baminamen se ek switch bam ko taiyaar karne ke liye or doosraa usamen dhamaakaa karne ke liye tha or puure bam ko charge dene ke liye 9 mem kii bydaree lagaai gai
 The sprinter deposited in the grenade was fired at least 5000 meters per second in explosive, ie every sprinter became a bullet
 bam ko is tarah se digaayan kiya gaya tha ki ardex chaahe jitna kam ho agar dhamaakaa ho to target batch na sake or vahi hua bhi
 Shivarasan was close to Rajiv gandhi
now Shivarasan also had a bomb in his hand and Dhanu, the human bomb that carried the bomb
 itanjar tha to bas rajeev gandhi kaa par isse pehle wo apni sajeesh ko thok bajaakar dekh lenaa chahta tha
 Aaj Tak has video of the rally held at Marina Beach in Chennai during the general elections in 1991
 is video main shivarasana apane target rajeev gandhi se mahaj 25-30 feet kii duuri par saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 In this rally of Jayalalithaa and Rajiv, Sivarasan arrived to take stock of Rajiv's safety
 yahaan usne rajeev kii janata se khul kar milane or lachar suraksha kii khaamiyon ko bhaanp liya par vanid jaik shivarasana yaheen nahin rukaa
 To ensure the experience of this rally, he took Manavbaum Dhanu with him in another political rally
 raily main final reki12 may 1991 ko shivarasana-dhanu ne purv piem veepi singh or diemke supremeo karunanidhi kii raily main final reki kii
 In this rally held at Arakkonam, Thiruvallur, Dhanu reached VP Singh very close and touched his feet
 bas bam kaa batan nahin dabaaya
 At the rally of former Prime Minister VP Singh, the level of security was not at all equal to Rajiv's security
 par shivarasana or dhanu ke shaatir iraade kaamyaab rahe
 This boosted Sivarasan's spirits and he saw his plan succeeding
 21 may ko thi rajeev gandhi kii sabhaloksabhaa chunaav kaa daur tha rajeev gandhi kii meeting 21 may ko shreeperambdur main tay ho gai
 Shivarasan decided in a blink of an eye that the plot would be completed on 21st
 20 kii raat shivarasana nalini ke ghar raily ke vigyaapan vaala akhbaar lekar pahunchaa or tay ho gaya ki ab 21 ko hi sajeesh puri hogi
 Dhanu wore glasses to dodge the security agencies for the first time on the night of 20 May at the house of Filmalini before the attack
 shubha ne dhanu ko belt pahana kar practice karwaai or shreeperambdur main kis tarah sajeesh ko anjaam tak pahunchaana he, isaki puri taiyaari mukammal kar lee gai
 All were completely calm and ready for the cause
 20 may kii raat ko sabhi ne saath milakar film dekhi or so gaye
 In the morning, five people, Shivarasan, Dhanu, Shubha, Nalini and Haribabu were ready to complete the plot
 jor kaa dhamaakaa hua or sab khatm ho gaya21 may 1991 kaa din tha
 The rally was celebrated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu, about 40 km from Madras
 rajeev gandhi ke aane main deree ho rahi thi
 It was repeatedly announced that Rajiv could reach the rally at any time
 pichley chah maheene se pak rahi sajeesh apane anjaam ke behad kareeb thi
 Rajiv Gandhi arrives at Sriperumbudur for a meeting
 vahaan manch se kuch dur hi indira gandhi kii pratimaa thi
 Where Rajiv Gandhi first garlanded and then moved towards the stage
 wo bairicads ke paas apane samarthakon se mil rahe the
 a woman wanted to reach Rajiv with a necklace
 lekin bheed kii vajah se vahaan nahin pahunch paa rahi thi
 Then Rajiv Gandhi's eye fell on him
 unhone use aage aane kaa ishaara kiya
 The woman approached Rajiv Gandhi and put him on a sandalwood necklace
 phir wo rajeev ke pair chune ke liye neeche jhuki or tabhi 10 bajkar 20 minute par ek tej dhamaakaa hua
 There was smoke and fire everywhere
 rajeev gandhi hameshaa ke liye is duniya se ja chuke the
 There was mourning of death everywhere
 insaani jismon ke tukade yahaan vahaan pade the
 It was all over
 jail main hai rajeev ke hatyaredhamake ke turant baad shivarasana chennai kii ore bhaag gaya
 Nalini and Sudha met him in Chennai
 vahaan shivarasana ne sudhaa ko bataaya ki haribabu to maaraa gaya, par uskaa camera vahiin padaa he
 Sivarasan had entrusted Sundaram with the responsibility of flying Haribabu's camera from the spot
 sundaram ne kaaphi koshish kii par naakaam rahaa or phir us camere ke role main kaid tasveeron ne suraksha agenciyon ko wo suraag die, jinhone rajeev ke hatyaron ko salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya

 It is difficult to believe but the news is that some players of Team India arrive at a restaurant on the same night ie on the night of May 11, after the crushing defeat against Sri Lanka in the crucial Super 8 match in St
 Lucia in the West Indies
 ek ore hindustan main jahaan karodo phans khilaadiyon ke kharaab khel se aahat hai, sann hai vahiin in khilaadiyon ko haar se shaayad koi matlab nahin
 Perhaps fun is more important to him on the night of the defeat

 This restaurant is right in front of the hotel where Team India was accommodated
 sutron ke mutabik sabase pehle ashish nehra ke saath hi bhartiya phans kii kahasuni shuru hui or baat kahasuni se hathapayee tak ja pahunchi
 It is also being said that Ashish Nehra's shirt was also torn in the scuffle
 phir is dhakkamukki main yuvaraj singh bhi shaamil ho gaye
 It is also being said that the matter was getting out of control but due to the interruption between the people present there, the matter was calm
 fark isse nahin padataa ki galati khilaadiyon kii thi yaa phir vahaan maujuud bhartiya phans kii
 But even after the defeat, it is also legitimate to be present in a pub or restaurant on the same night for fun
 maamla or bhi zyada hairaan karne vaala isliye bhi he kyonki isse pehle bhi team india ne kai baar haar ke baad kuch aisi hi harkaton se team kaa naam kharaab kiya he
 Although the incident on the night of May 11 has been denied by the Yuvraj on Twitter, but the players will have to answer their actions to the country on reaching India

 jismfaroshi or nafrat ke ird-gird gum rahi meerut kii tripal murder mistry ab ek aise shaks par ja kar tik gai he, jisane katl se pehle riya se aakhri baar baat kii thi
 In this case, 28 year old Riya was killed most brutally
 katl se pehle jis shaks ne usase baat kii, police ne jab uske mobile phone detail nikaali, to pataa chalaa wo mobile phone hi farji kagajaton par kharida gaya tha
 In such a situation, the question arises as to who is the real culprit of this triple murder? According to the information, Chandrasekhar Gupta, his wife Poonam and Riya were killed in Meerut on Saturday
 kaatil ne jahaan chandrashekhar or punam kii hatya galaa ret kar kii thi, vahiin riya ko usne ek ke baad ek kai chaaku maare the
 Riya's Belibas corpse was lying in the bed of the house
 uske paas hi condom or duusari kai aapattinajak chijen bhi thi
 Three cups of tea were also found in the house
 is puure seen of krime ko dekh kar police ko shaq he ki katl ke peeche jismfaroshi kaa racket or usee silsile main paidaa hai nafrat kii vajah ho sakati he
 When the police investigating this case investigated Riya's phone details, she got a new shock
 police ko ye to pataa chalaa ki katl se pehle yani shanivaar kii shaam riya saadhe chaar baje tak apane phone par kisi se baat kar rahi thi
 After this, his phone switched off
 aise shaq he ki katl shaam saadhe chaar se paanch ke bich hi hua, lekin iske baad jab police ne riya ko kol karne vaale shaks ke number kii detail nikaali to pataa chalaa ki uskaa phone conection hi farzi naam or pahchaan par liya gaya tha
 The murderer has a very deep plot
 police kii radar par he riya kaa patitripal murder kii is rongte khadey karne vaali kahani main riya ke pati pushpendra urf jitendra par police ko pehle din se shaq he
 There are broadly two important reasons for this doubt
 pehla to ye ki riya ke saath pushpendra ke rishte koi bahut achche nahin bataae jate hai
 The second is that Pushpendra is the person with whom Riya was last seen alive
 aise main uskaa police kii radar par hona lajimi he
 For these reasons, the police are also constantly questioning Pushpendra
 lekin uske haath ab bhi khaali hai
 The police investigation is currently underway
 beauty parlor ke bahaane nikali riyabatate chalem ki vaardaat ke roj chandrashekhar ke ghar aane se pehle riya apane pati ko beauty parlor jane kii baat kah kar ghar se nikali thi
 That is, he was with Riya till some time before the murder
 lekin andar kii kahani ye he ki uske tallukaat riya se koi bahut achche nahin the
 Often there was an argument and a fight between the two
 jaahir he pushpendra khud ko bekusur to bataa hi rahaa tha, lekin jab uski baton kii tasdik ke liye police ne electranik servilans kaa sahaara liya, to subut is maamle ke sandigdh pushpendra ke hi haq main najar aane lage
 Media has a very important role in society
 media ko loktantric vyavastha kaa chauthaa stambh bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki isaki jimmedaari desh or logon kii samasyaon ko saamne laane ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par najar rakhana bhi he
 But in the last few days questions have started to be raised on the functioning and attitude of the media
 sawaal yah he ki kya media badal rahaa he? kya media ke naitik paksh par aise sawaal jaij hai? There is no doubt that there is a lot of change in the way the media works and the character
 lekin yah badlaav kitna sahi or kitna galat, yah bataa paanaa mushkil he
 Compared to pre-independence, there has been a fundamental difference in the appearance of media
 pehle media ko aaj kii tarah aazaadee hasil nahin thi
 The first Indian newspaper 'the Bengal Gazette' was started by James Augustus in 1780
 us vakt ke governor general warren hestings kii patni kii aalochana karne ke badale main unhen chaar maheene jail kii sajaa kaatane ke saath-saath paanch sau rupee jurmaana dena padaa tha
 Then the British used to operate the press in their capacity
 lekin aazaadee ke baad bahut kuch badlaav aayaa he
 The press gained independence
 sarkaar or press ke bich jo dooriyaan thim, ve kaaphi kam hui hai
 Around three hundred newspapers were being published in India at the time of independence
 lekin ab inaki sankhya teraa hajaar se bhi zyada he
 As far as media freedom is concerned, more than one third of the people in the world live in countries where the media is not free to decide its direction
 surveykshanon kii reporton ke mutabik media kii aazaadee ke maamle main bharat kaa sthaan ek sau chalisvaan he
 However, this assessment does not seem directly reliable
 thodaa kareeb se dekhen to aisa lagata he ki bharat main media kii aazaadee par philhal koi zyada gambhir khatra nahin he
 Barring government organizations like Doordarshan and Akashwani, the government does not dominate any private channel
 yahaan agar ham duusare deshon kii baat karen to finland, norway or netherland media kii aazaadee ke maamle main sabase upar hai
 Countries like Eritrea, North Korea and Syria are at the bottom of this test
 in deshon main media ko apane hisaab se muddon par khabaren dene yaa baat karne kii koi aazaadee hasil nahin he
 There the media works under the government in a way
 halaat kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki iritria main sabase zyada patrkaar jail main band hai
 The question arises as to how the freedom of media is to be judged
 bharat ke samvidhan main anuchhed 19 (1) ke tahat abhivyakti ke adhikaar kii guarantee di gai he
 Freedom of the press is part of that, so it is not discussed separately
 aakhir media kii aazaadee kaa matlab kya he? kya sirf sarkaar ke niyantran se baahar rahane ko ham uski aazaadee maan len? aamtaur par media ko sarkaar niyantrit nahin karti
 But does the media work for the interest of the government and the corporate world? darasal, media par aaj jo sawaal uth rahe hai, uske liye shaayad kuch sthitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 If we consider the matter of working under the pressure of the media, then it is yet to be clear what kind of pressure it is, and whether it is affecting the subject matter too! Today most questions are being raised by the politicians regarding the coverage of the media
 kuch rajaneta apane andaaj main media ko chalaanaa chaahate hai
 If the media shows positive news in their favor, then they call it good and if this is not done then they start putting the media in the dock
 is maamle main arvind kejariwal sabase aage nikal gaye or yahaan tak ki hadabadi main patrakaron ko jail bhejne kii baat bhi kah gaye
 The truth is that if someone benefited the most through the media, then it was Arvind Kejriwal and his party
 pichley ek saal main media ne sabase zyada prachaar aam aadmi party or iske netaaon kaa kiya he
 From Anna's movement till now, the media has made these people heroes
 kejariwal kehete hai ki media modi or bhartiya janata party kaa prachaar karata rahata he
 But after the 2002 Gujarat riots, if the media raised the most questions and criticized anyone the most, it is Narendra Modi and his government
 congress ke bhrashtachar or mahangaai ko bhi media ne kaaphi jagah di
 However, Arvind Kejriwal has now clarified that his reaction was in the context of some channels
 sawaal he ki kya kejariwal kii is tarah kii pratikriya raajnneetik nahin he? chunaav ke samay hi rajanetaaon ko media kii yaad zyada kyon aati he
 There are many other problems in the country, why don't politicians surround the media with them? Not only Kejriwal, the leaders of other parties also criticize the media
 isamen do raay nahin ki media par uthe sawaalon main kahin na kahin sachai he
 Is the media misusing its power? How much truth is there in the matter of 'paid news' being raised? Is there corruption in the media too? Whatever it is, it is probably not okay to weigh everyone in the same scales
 bahut-se aise samachar channel or akhbaar hai jo apni eemaandaar reporting or vishleshanon se media kii chhavi acchhee banaae rakhane kii koshish karte hue samaaj ke vyapak hit ke liye kaam karte hai
 Today, both the medium of print and electronic media have a big challenge to protect their credibility
 internet ke jamaane main inaki lokapriyata main kami ai he
 The role of and dependence on print and electronic media is steadily decreasing
 aaj bharat main das pratishat se zyada log internet kaa istemaal karne lage hai or iskaa dayera dhire-dhire or bada ho rahaa he
 News reaches people quickly through the Internet
 is maamle main soshal media bhi kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahaa he
 On the other hand, newspapers are worse in western countries than Asia
 jahaan pashchimi deshon main akhabaaron ke prasar main kami ai he, vahiin asia main badhotaree hui he
 Countries like China and India have the largest number of people in the world, but there is still a long way to go in terms of access to the Internet
 asia ko samachar patron ke bazaar kaa 'raja' mana jaataa he
 More than a hundred of the world's best news are published in Upper Asia
 print media bhi zyada se zyada computerikrut hota ja rahaa he
 The problem is that digital does not benefit much, because it is not possible to get the desired publicity through it
 print ke saath-saath electronic media kii haalat bhi kaaphi kharaab he
 The number of channels is increasing and people are moving from one channel to another
 yahi vajah he ki aaj tiarapy channelon ke liye tanaav kaa kaaran banati ja rahi he
 However, questions have been raised about the calculation and quality of channels against trps
 media ke kawarej main kaaphi badlaav aayaa he
 At times, it seems that the media has become person-centered
 kuch naatakeeyata or atiranjana ke saath kaarykram paros kar darshakon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The media seems to be running away from its social responsibility
 saamaajik khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 Nowadays only leaders appear on TV channels
 tivi par netaaon ke bhaashanon or bayanon se hi samachar ke vakt bhare rahete hai, vahiin akhabaaron main vigyaapan zyada or khabaren kam dikhaai detii hai
 The reach of the media has expanded, but the same cannot be said about coverage
 vah gaanvon ke logon kii samasyaon se achoota najar aata he
 There are a lot of problems in the country, but Media may not have anything to do with them
 chaahe ham kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii baat karen yaa phir mahilaon parahone vaale atyaacharon yaa aparaadhon kii, media main aise maamalon ko jagah dene main yaa to kanjusee dikhaai jaati he yaa phir jaruri samvedansheeltaa nahin barti jaati
 Then there is another worrying Pahul media double attitude; He is only serious about the events and problems of the cities
 shaharon main bhi, madhyavarg kii samasyaayein hi use adhik pareshaan karti hai
 For example, if the traffic gets jammed for hours or even two hours due to rain, the screaming starts on the TV channels, but the areas where people have been yearning for water are not taken care of
 aisa nahin ki media koi acha kaam nahin karata
 The media has raised major scams in the country, whether they have been associated with the Commonwealth Games event or related to the allocation of 2-G and coal
 kai aise samachar channel or akhbaar samaaj kii samasyaon ke prati sachet hai or unhone kuch vishesh abhiyaan bhi shuru kiye hai
 In cases like Kanya Bachao, Pahar Bachao or Nirbhaya incident, we have seen the media in a new way
 uski sakriyata or mukharata kii vajah se hi nirbhaya cond par upja naagarik aakrosh jan-andolan kaa rup le sakaa or aakhirkaar yonhinsa virdohi kanoonon main sanshodhan hue
 However, the amount of media reported in the Birbhum gang rape case suggests that the media is also governed by class requests
 use lekar uchit hi media or un khabaron par sawaal uthe
 Looking at such a form of media, one remembers Joseph Stalin's quote - 'only one death is mourning and innumerable death figures!' amrapali ke tamaam project main nirmaan kaary ab tak shuru nahin ho paane kii vajah se nefova ne supreme court main amrapali group ke khilaaf rit yachika daayar kar di he
 It will be heard today
 ab tak jin project ke liye supreme court main yachika daayar kii gai he unamem amrapali ke golf homes, kingswood, leisure park, river vyuu project, verona hits, jora hits, adarsh awaas yojana, centurian park or dream vaili project shaamil hai

 hamaari camera team donon mike kii checking kar hi rahi thi ki ek car bina kisi syran vaayran ke girnaar apartment main pravesh kar jaati he
 Gently someone says that Arvind Kejriwal has come
 vibhav, manish sisodiya or deepak bhi car se utarate hai or namaskara ke saath intervyuu shuru ho jaataa he
 The fatigue of the day's political activities is clearly visible on Arvind's face
 ghaziabad se sata he kaushambi kaa ilaaka jahaan arvind kejariwal kaa purana ghar he
 The disappointment of all the apartments in Kaushambi always bothers me
 grey rang kii imaaraten raajnneeti ke ‘grey aria’ kii tarah maujuud hai jiske baahar patari par pani bechney vaale ne bataaya ki assi fisadi gharon ke log rose pani kharid kar pite hai
 Spends a thousand rupees a month on drinking water
 kaushambi ke logon ke bal is pani se kaaphi jhadane lage hai
 Sudhir Paniwala was being told like a doctor, but my eyes were fixed on Kaushambi's desolate and Benur buildings
 ye apartment itane maayoos or andhere andhere se kyon lagate hai
 Have people learned to live in low light? nishchay hi pracheen bharat kaa ek pramukh janapad kaushambi is tarah feekaa nahin hoga
 Well the interview started
 arvind kejariwal pradhanmantri narendra modi par kisi tarah ke akshep se bachane lage
 Repeatedly asked, but kept on saying that he is pitted against bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate in Delhi and not Narendra Modi
 main baar baar poochta rahaa ki bijepi to modi ke naam par hi dilli main utarane ja rahi he
 On this strategy, she has won one Lok Sabha and two assembly elections
 arvind kejariwal ke jawaab se laga ki ve abhi taiyaar nahin he ki modi ko mudda banaakar dilli ke mudde ko bijepi ke haath main jane diya jaae
 He wants to answer every question around the 49-day achievements and the issue of corruption
 apni baatcheet main baar baar bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki ye kya kam badi uplabdhi he ki hamaare ek bhi vidhayak nahin toote
 Had our party not been strong, none of these would have broken down and the BJP would have formed a government
 lekin hamaare vidhayakon ne paise kii raajnneeti ko thukraa diya he
 With this, my next question became that in terms of resources, advertising and organization, how can you fight and fight if you are better than BJP
 arvind ne turant sweekaar kar liya he ki hamaare paas paise nahin hai
 And even if we deposit, how much will we make? pichhali baar bees karod tak pahunche the, bahut se bahut tees karod hi to honge lekin kya bijepi tees karod main chunaav ladegi
 i know that BJP has no shortage of money and resources
 arvind kejariwal ne ye to mana ki is baar unki ladaai sirf bijepi se he
 Congress is not in the fight
 bhrashtachar ko lekar unke die gaye tamaam javaabon se main santusht nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 My plea was that Delhi has dropped the issue
 janalokapal yaa lokapal ko lekar ab wo us tarah se bhavuk nahin he jis tarah se ek saal pehle thi
 Arvind Kejriwal did not agree
 unka kahana he ki aam aadmi aaj bhi nagar nigamon se lekar aspataalon ke bhrashtachar se jujh rahaa he
 He will once again make Janlokpal and corruption an issue and ask for a chance for five years
 unke jawaab se aisa lag rahaa tha ki is baar vaaki aam aadmi ko us tabake se ummid he jo samaaj ke nichle se lekar madhyam hisse ke bich he
 Arvind has come to realize that it will be a challenge to bring the middle class in his favor in this fight
 baar baar poochne par wo bol uthte hai ki is baar dilli ke madhyamvarg ko tay karnaa hoga ki wo bavana yaa trilokapuri jaisi ghatnaon ke khilaaf he yaa samarthan main
 He will have to come forward against the politics of hate
 arvind ab rajaneta ho chuke hai
 Do not believe that this time there is a do or die situation for his party
 kehete hai ki pichley chaar maheenon main unki party kii jaden or gahari hui hai
 His organization has been formed from street to business circle
 unka vishwaas he ki jis tarah se unke vidhayakon ne kareed farokht kii raajnneeti ko nakaar diya he, usase nahin lagata ki aam aadmi party kaa vajood is chunaav ke nattejey par nirbhar karegaa
 Questions were beginning to end
 main baar baar narendra modi par unke tevar ko bhaanpane kaa prayaas karnaa chahta tha
 But after the interview ended, his house went to drink tea, then the desolation of Kaushambi's buildings started again
 parking main badi gadiyon ko dekhakar nahin lagata he ki yahaan ke logon main sansaadhan kii koi kami he
 This is the question why these people are not able to change the appearance of their area
 ab ham arvind kejariwal ke saath unke ghar ke bheetar the
 Started eating papad with his wife
 phone par vyast ho gaye
 There was another time before this
 tab or ab ke bich ve mukhyamantri se purv mukhyamantri ho chuke hai
 But the house was settled again
 saamaan bhi vahi ke vahi lage
 Can not say with the claim, but after a year, i went home thinking that there is nothing special that shows that the house has changed
 chaay pite-pite ranneetiyon par charchaa hone lagi
 Arvind no longer speaks as before
 sune ja rahe the
 The answer was not found, but the question floated, it certainly appeared that this time the battle is decisive
 mushkil he
 The question of what would happen was floating
 rajaneta kabhi sweekaar nahin karte
 They always say they are ready for battle
 bhrashtachar par nitish kumaar ke doharaa maapdand apnaane kaa aarope lagaate hue lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan ne kaha ki ranchi kii ek adaalat main sibiai ke ek adhikari dwaara chaara ghotaale main bihar ke mukhyamantri ke dhan lene kii baat kehane ke saath hi unka ‘mukhauta’ utar gaya he
 Paswan said, 'mr
 Clean (nitish Kumar)' s mask has come off
 yah ghatana shuru se hi unke bhrashtachar main sanlipt hone kii ore ingit karti he
 The corrupt work continues even after he became the Chief Minister
 ’ paswan kaa bayaan in khabaron ke baad aayaa he ki sibiai ke ek adhikari ne shuukravaar ko ek vishesh adaalat main bataaya ki nitish ne chaara ghotaale main paisa liya tha
 Accusing the Bihar Chief Minister of adopting double standards, the LJP leader alleged that corruption had become common in the Bihar government ever since Nitish Kumar came to power
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, "goyal ko iskar vibhaag kaa ek niyamit poochtacha patr mila tha jo messors telvinds limited ke geneva sthit echesbisi bank main khate se sambandhit tha
 " kaha gaya he ki company (messors telvinds limited) ke astitv ko lekar bharat sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon ne puri tarah khulaasa kiya tha or soochna praudyogiki vibhaag ne jo sawaal kiye the, unke santoshprad jawaab die the
 "there is no account in Swiss bank in the name of Naresh Goyal, as alleged," the statement said
 aise main yah kahana ki unhone swiss khaaton main anginat dhan chhupaae hai, saraasar jhooth he
 " is bich, bhaajapa ne centre sarkaar se kaha ki unki party sabase pehle videsh main chhipaae gaye kaledhan ko waapas laane kii maang karti he or yah bhi ki bharat main echesbisi bank ke sanchaalan kii vah jaanch karaae
 Soon after Arvind Kejriwal accused the Congress-led central government of protecting black money hides abroad, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman also questioned the government about what it had done so far to control black money
 tippaniyan Sitharaman said, "if the government cannot tell what steps it takes against black money, then we demand that in this sequence, it should get the HSBC case investigated
 " Referring to the Congress meeting held in Surajkund, Haryana near Delhi, he said, "we remind the Congress that it promised to bring back black money in the manifesto in 100 days which it has not completed till date
" " It is said that the existence of the company (M / s Tailwinds Limited) was fully disclosed by various departments of the Government of India and the Department of Information Technology had given satisfactory answers to the questions raised
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, "naresh goyal ke naam se swiss bank main koi khaataa nahin he, jaisaa ki aarope lagaaya gaya he

 ajtak ne kiya he ek bada sting oparation
 In every government department of the capital of the country, there is an open game of bribery and corruption
 jal board ho yaa bijli ghar, bikri kar vibhaag ho yaa kooparative sosayadi, khulaasa transport vibhaag kaa bhi hoga
 You will also be stunned to hear the truth that has been revealed in Aaj Tak's Special Investigation Team's 'operation Range Haath'
 arvind kejariwal sarkaar ke jate hi bhrashtachar kaa rakshas phir se jaag uthaa he
 Officers of big departments are heating their pockets with the amount of bribe
 yah chaahe kejariwal kaa asar ho yaa sting oparation kii dehshat, lekin jamini hakeekat yahi he ki kejariwal kii jab sarkaar thi, to jal board se lekar bijlighar, or bijlighar se lekar kachhari tak, hare-hare noton kaa khel kuch din ke liye band ho gaya tha
 The truth is that along with the playing of notes, many people were also stopped working
 idhar 14 farvari ko jaise hi kejariwal ne kursi ko talaak diya, dallalon kii to jaise shahar main chaandi ho gai
 From RTO office to outside the power stations, there was a rush of brokers
 chaahe license banvaanaa ho yaa bijli kaa bill kam karwaanaa ho yaa phir ghar par pani kaa tanker pahunchane kii baat ho, jeb se rakam nikaaliye or jhatpat kaam karvaa lijie
 After Kejriwal's government, Aajtak's Special Investigation Team conducted a 'sting operation' of Iman and Iqbal of officers and employees in the country's capital
 dilli jal board main ghuste hi rishwat kaa sach khufia camere ke saamne beparda ho gaya
 Our intelligence cameras recorded bids for forgiveness of bills in the power stations of Delhi
 hatheli garm kiijie or bill kam kiijie
 
 
 We got an example of how the government vault is being defused in the country's capital 
 yahaan par tex kaa paisa, sarkari khajaana afasaron kii jebon main ja rahaa he
 Cooperative societies are also a big sport in Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke maatahat aane vaale is daftar main bhi bina paise aap koi kaagaj hasil nahin kar sakate
 The condition of bribe officers and employees is that they have started counting bribe notes openly at the office table or at the government cash counter itself
 jaahir taur par sarkaar kisi kii aae yaa kisi kii jaae, lekin sting oparation main yah baat saaf ho gai ki dilliwaalon kii jeb katane kaa mausam phir aa gaya he
 Waterboard fills with note-in-the-box fills of officers with water-tank and fills pockets of officers with note-note, this sight was shown to our team at the time when the Turkman Gate Office of the Jal Board on the pretext of booking a tanker Arrived
 is daftar se janata-janardan ke liye pani ke tanker supplai kiye jate hai
 Although a government slip of 700 rupees is deducted for a tanker, but thousands of rupees are taken here without cutting the slip
 ham sidhe takaraae jal board ke booking clerk puuran chand se
 
 
 Aaj Tak - How much should i pay you? 
 
 
 Puran Chand - Think as much as you want
 
 
 bas itnaa samaj lijie, privet main aap lete ho, to 2500 rupee se kam main nahin miltaa or pani bhi unka boring kaa hota he
 Sometimes sand and sand also come
 ajtak-aapkaa pani thik hoga?puuran chand-are number 1 kaa pani hota he
 
 
 
 jal board ke booking clerk puuran chand ne kaha ki unke jal board kaa pani number ek kaa he, yah bhi sahi he ki unki rishwat kaa rate bhi number 1 se kam nahin he
 Aaj Tak - How much should i give 
 
 puuran chand-aap thik samajho jaisaa
 
 
 Bhandare's work
 shaadi hoti, to main bol detaa, magar itani meharbaani hamaare upar kar dena
 Please be so kind
 
 
 
 
 ajtak-ek
 
 
 two
 
 
 teen
 
 
 Four
 
 
 
 Puran Chand - Please be so kind to us, don't you humiliate anyone
 
 
 ajtak-ye 2 hazaar rupee hai, thik hai, jitna baaki aap kahoge, main de duungaa aapako
 
 
 Puran Chand - No, i will not
 main ek bhi aapse
 
 
 
 kaam aapkaa ho jayega
 
 
 I'll get you the slip
 Monday ko banegi ab time khatm ho gaya he
 Bribery in the electricity department is also going on in the bribery water board, so the bribery continues in the power house
 bijli kaa bill maaf karana ho yaa kam karana ho, paise se mumkin he
 But how the power department officials force the people to pay bribe, Aaj Tak also busted it
 dilli ke sagarpur ilaake main bijli ghar ke ek adhikari ne ghar kii pehali manzil par meter na lagane kaa maamla pakadaa
 The officer later struck a deal to crack down the case
 transport vibhaag bhi kuch peeche nahinoparation range haath main ab baari he bikri kar vibhaag, kooparative sosayadi, transport vibhaag or dilli main purvottar kii dm kii
 Aajtak conducted a sting operation, from tax penalty, to the withdrawal of the paper of the cooperative society, from the transport department to the DM office, the open game of money continues
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main maal se laden in trakon kii qatari main kai trek aise hai, jinhone maal to lod kar liya, lekin pakki raseed nahin banavaai
 That is, without paying any tax on the goods, these trucks were entering inside Delhi
 aapako jaanakar tajjub hoga ki ye trek pakade jane ke baad bhi puraa tex nahin dete or chhot jate hai
 The truckers heat the fists of those VAT officers, and go ahead
 ajtak ke reporter ne ghoose ke is khel ko benakaab karne ke liye ek aise hi trek kaa sahaara liya
 Undercover reporter met with officers with intelligence cameras to know the truth of the VAT office
 dilli sarkaar kii maatahat aane vaali ko-operative sosayadi main bhi agar aap ghoose dene ko taiyaar hai, to adhikari sahaayta karne main sadaiv tatpar rahete hai
 The undercover reporter had to warm the government's fist to know the details of the housing society of Delhi's posh Dwarka area
