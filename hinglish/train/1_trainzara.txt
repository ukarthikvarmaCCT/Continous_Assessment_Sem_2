 "" Film: New York Director: Kabir Khan Artist: John Abraham, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Katrina Kaif and Irrfan
 One misses one thing of Yash Raj Films' director Yash Chopra by watching this film
 kaala pathar kii naakaami ke baad apni galati kaa ehsaas karte hue unhone kaha tha ki jab tak aap kisi film kii kahani ko ek vaakya main bayaan na kar saken, tab tak us vishay par aap safal film nahin bana sakate
 Kabir Khan, director of the Yash Raj banner's political film New York, seems to hold that sutra sentence deeply
 epabiai ke jaanchakarta raushan (irfan) ke jariye aakhri drishy main unhone vah suutaravakya kahalava bhi diya haih galat vakt par insaan galat faisla karata he, or mulk bhi
 It hurts the man as well as the country
 film kii puri team is suutaravakya ko shiddat se pakadakar anushaasan ke saath chalate hue puraa cinemai anand paidaa karti he
 This is perhaps the first political film to be made under the Yash Raj banner
 relies se pehle bani apni image se puri tarah se bhinn
 It would be wrong to question the American thinking about terror, that it imputes the American thinking about terrorism
 9 / 11 ke baad sirf shaq kii bina par pakade gaye ek musalmaan yuvak sam (abraham) kaa epabiai se pratishodh par utarana or uske dost umr (nil) kaa dabaav main andercover agent ban epabiai kii madad karnaa
 Total deposit is the story
 lekin drishy niyojan aisa he ki ection eliments ko romaanch baraabar apane kaabo main rakhata he
 Despite four important characters, the film's axis rests on Irrfan
 bina ection ke sirf sanvaadon kii piching, intonaton or chehre par bhaavon ke jariye unhone aisa kamaal kaa asar paidaa kiya he jo abhinay ke chaatro ko padhaane main kaam aayega
 Despite being in front of him in all the scenes, Neil is also not weak
 neuyork manoranjan ke saare tatwon ko sametakar chalate hue bhi aatankwaad par ek tarksangat tippanee karti he
 That is why it is an important film
 akasar desh kii academiyaan apane kaam kii vajah se kam or vivaadon kii vajah se zyada surkhiyon main rahati hai
 Due to one such controversy, the sweetness of Bhojpuri has turned into bitterness in the past
 maamla lok gayika malini avasthi ko bihar bhojpuri academy kaa antarrashtriya saanskrithik rajdoot (brands ambeseder) banaae jane kaa tha
 Awadhi origin singer became the brand ambassador and the Bhojpuri speakers got teary-eyed
 bhojpuri gayak manoj tiwari or bharat sharma ne yah kahkar virodh karnaa shuru kar diya ki gaiyr-bhojpuri ko brands ambeseder bananaa bhojpuri ke kalakaaron kaa apmaan he
 Seeing the controversy growing, Awasthi, 45, was also cut off from becoming a brand ambassador
 unka kahana tha ''bhojpuri ke liye kuch kar sakuun, yahi sochakar maine haa kii thi, lekin vivaad ke saath bhojpuri ko aage le janaa thodaa mushkil he
 Therefore refused

 40-year-old Manoj said, "my name was threatened with blacklist in Bhojpuri because of opposition to the Speaker's decision
" sharada sinha, bharat sharma, ravi kishan jaise kai bhojpuri kalakaar lambey samay se iske vikaas ke liye koshish kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, what was the rationale for making any Awadhi speaking ambassador
 ”57 varshiya bharat kaa maananaa he ki is kadam se aisa sandesh gaya he ki bhojpuri main kaabil log nahin hai
 He says, "an attempt was made to suppress my protest saying that my black letter is with him (the president)
" ” lok gayika padmashri sharada sinha bhi garajin
 He said, "how did the government give such an exemption to the academy?" Bhojpuri is being harmed by the controversy
 branding kisi product kii hoti he, bhojpuri kaa brands ambeseder banane kii kya jarurat pad gai?”udhar, sarkaar ne is vivaad se pallaa hi jhaad liya
 Education Department Spokesperson and Joint Director R
 es
 Singh says, "the president has acted outside the jurisdiction
 unase spashtikaran maanga gaya he
 Awasthi has not been made a brand ambassador by the government
 ” academy ke nideshak jitendra prasad ne bhi bayaan jari kiya ki is prakaran se nideshak or bihar sarkaar kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 To this, Dubey says, "awasthi should have been welcomed to be the ambassador
 vah gaiyr-bhojpuri hote hue bhi bhojpuri ke liye kaam karti rahi hai
 Manoj Tiwari has protested in search of political ground as he is eyeing Buxar constituency after Gorakhpur
 ” manoj iskaa jawaab kuch yun dete hai, ''dube ke kaarykaal main aisa koi kaam nahin hua, jisase bhojpuri kaa bhala hua ho

 It is said that Rahul's mother Sonia Gandhi and sister Priyanka are not in favor of leaving his presidency

 In today's meeting, his mother's close aide Ahmed Patel warned Rahul Gandhi that if he left the Congress leadership, the party could collapse

 Sonia, who has the distinction of completing the longest tenure as the Congress President, has given important clues about her feelings in a letter to her constituency Rae Bareli

 Rahul Gandhi alleges that the top leaders of the Congress were focused only on saving their political legacy
 unhone apane beton ko chunaav main utaara or unke chunaav prachaar par dhyaan kendrit kiye rahe
 Whereas the Gandhi family has inherited a political legacy to the fifth generation and has also gained some trust

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan had promised his country to end terrorism within 90 days of assuming power, but despite the passing of 197 days, no concrete action has been taken against terrorist organizations and their bosses so far
 itnaa hi nahin, imran khan ke satta main aane ke baad kashmir main siarpief ke kafile par ab tak kaa sabase bada aatanki hamalaa bhi hua
 At the same time, Pakistan, which has become the base of terror, is demanding the Nobel Peace Prize for its PM Imran Khan
 iske liye pakistan kii sansad main baqayada prastaav tak laayaa gaya, jisamen kaha gaya ki bhartiya payalat abhinandan vardhman kii rihaai ke badale imran ko shanti nobel puraskaar diya jaae
 In such a situation, the question arises that how should India obey Imran Khan, who is singing peace in front of the world
 aapako bataa den ki pulavama aatanki hamale or uske baad bharat or pakistan ke bich hui hawaii bhidnt ke baad se seemaa par jabardast tanaav he
 India is pressuring Pakistan to take action against terrorism, but so far no concrete action has been taken by Pakistan against the terrorists
 yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he ki pakistan khoonkhaar aatankiyon ke liye surakshit panaahagaah bana hua he
 Where has Emraan Khan's history of ending terrorism testifies that whatever the Nizam of Pakistan has been, but there has never been any concrete action against the terrorists
 cricketer se rajaneta bane imran khan ne saal 2012 main ajtak ke kaarykram main kaha tha ki agar pakistan ke pradhanmantri banate hai, to 90 din ke bheetar aatankwaad kaa khaatmaa kar denge, lekin unako satta kii kaman sanbhale 197 din biit chuke hai or abhi tak pakistan main dehshatgard aatanki khuleam gum rahe hai
 Pakistan has so far kept all the dreaded terrorists like Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, Dawood Ibrahim and Syed Salauddin
 ye aatankwaadi or inke aatanki sanghathan pakistan sarkaar or sena kii chhatrachhaaya main apane khud ko lagaataar majboot kar rahe hai
 Pakistan gives refuge to refugees by taking help from abroad pakistanpakistan first asks for financial help to eliminate terrorists from abroad and later gives safeguard to terrorists instead of taking action
 pakistan lambey samay se aatankwaad ko apni videsh niti ke rup main istemaal kar rahaa he
 This terrorist of Pakistan in the Kashmir Valley is continuously carrying out their incidents
 pakistan main pal rahe khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathanpakistan ko vahaan kii sena chalaati he
 The Pakistani army and ISI have a long list of terrorist organizations they have kept
 in aatanki sanghathanon main lashkar-e-taiyyaba, jaish-e-mohammad, jamaat-ud-daawa, alqaida, hijbul mujahidin, indian mujahidin, taharik-e-taliban, taharik-e-phurkan, al badr, jamaat-ul-mujahidin, harakat-ul-mujahidin, harakat-ul-ansaar, harakat-ul-jihad-e-islamic, lashkar-e-jhangavi, dukhtaraan-e-millat, sipaah-e-sahaba, jaish-ul-adal or falaah-e-insaaniyat foundation shaamil hai
 The Pakistani army and ISI train these terrorists
 saath hi bharat main hamalaa karne ke liye ghuspaith karaate hai
 The culprits of the Pulwama terror attack also did not act on the Imran government
 Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan may be saying that his land will not be allowed to be used for terrorism against other countries, but the reality is different
 pakistani aatanki bharat samet duusare deshon main apane napak mansoobon ko khuleam anjaam de rahe hai
 The Pakistani army and ISI are infiltrating militants in Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par hue aatmghaatee hamale ke peeche bhi pakistani aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa haath tha
 jaish-e-mohammed himself claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack
 is hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, India also handed over the dossier of Pulwama attack to Pakistan, but no action has been taken so far
 ab pakistan isse pallaa jhaadne kii bhi koshish main juta hua he
 He says that there is no evidence of Pakistani terrorists being involved in the Pulwama attack

" rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot pehle se hi deshbhar main ek saath chunaav karaane ke idia par vichaar karne kii maang karte rahe hai
 But ever since the Congress has made its stand against it, Ashok Gehlot has been saying this to the Election Commission in another way
 baar-baar lagane vaali aachaar samhita se pareshaan hokar pichhali baar ashok gahalot ne chunaav ayog se kuch chunaav ek saath karaane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 But he has now written a new letter in which he has said to give relaxation in the code of conduct during the Election Commission
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne bharat ke nirvachan ayog ko patr likhakar adarsh aachaar samhita kii samiksha kii maang kii he
 What did Ashok Gehlot write in the letter? In this letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, Ashok Gehlot has written that the model code of conduct should be minimum and its various provisions should be reviewed
 patr main bataaya gaya he ki lambey samay tak aachaar samhita lagu rahane ke kaaran rajyon ko sanvaidhanik dayitvon ke nirvahan main baadha utpann hoti he or nitigat aapangata kii sthiti ban jaati he
 Gehlot has cited that during the Lok Sabha elections, the work of governance came to a complete standstill as the code of conduct remained in force throughout the country for 78 days and due to this the common people had to face a lot of problems
 gahalot ne patr main is baat kaa bhi hawala diya he ki aachaar samhita ke paalan ko lekar ayog ke andar matbhedon ne is sanvaidhanik sanstha kii saakh ko aghat pahunchaaya he
 Ashok Gehlot has suggested in the letter that during the Code of Conduct, the Chief Minister, Minister, Chief Secretary and Director General of Police are prohibited from taking direct feedback from the authorities and monitoring law and order and public interest
 iske chalate aavashyak nirnay nahin liye jate
 Elections in the Lok Sabha are usually held in summer, during this time there are various problems related to water management in the desert region like Rajasthan
 garmi ke mausam main bijli jaisi ati aavashyak sevaaon kii uplabdhta or sudhaar kaary bhi prabhavit hota he
 There should not be such restrictions during the code of conduct
 iske alaava rosemara ke kaaryon par aachaar samhita lagu nahin honi chahie
 Necessary meetings are also prohibited in the code of conduct, due to which law and order situation arises, the ban should be removed
 jahaan matdaan ho jaae vahaan matganana tak aachaar samhita taarkik nahin hoti
 Therefore, consideration should be made in this regard
 rajkeey vishram sthalon par thaharne ke liye bhi avasar die jane chahie
 In fact, after winning the assembly elections, the government could not take decisions because of the election code of conduct and the Congress government considers this as one of the reasons for its defeat

 He said that the nuclear deal between India and the US is not just a nuclear deal
 yah donon deshon ke bich kii ranneetik saajhedaari kii prakruti ko darshaati he
 This is a matter of concern for China
 korea ke saath america kii 'dushmani', china ko degi maukahaalanki china isko lekar bahut zyada chintit bhi nahin he
 Trump has been battling with North Korea on the other front, engaged in boosting relations with India
 haan kaa maananaa he ki trump prashasan akele uttar korea kaa masalaa hal nahin kar saktaa
 Maybe China can help resolve this
 jaisaa ki zyaadaatar america maanate hai ki is maamle main china bhi ek party he
 Renowned expert on nuclear issues, Han believes that not much can be expected from Trump to secure India's entry into the NSG
 unhone kaha, 'trump prashasan ke aane ke baad enesji main bharat kii entry ke mudde par unki nitiyon main bahut zyada badlaav nahin aayaa he

 Han believes that India has a fixed line in terms of foreign policy and it does not matter who has the government in Delhi
 modi ke bare main logon kii raay he ki ve bahut zyada rashtravaadi hai or congress ke bich kaa rasta pakadakar chalane kii niti ke bajaay duniya ke bare main unka drushtikon zyada vaastavik he
 'india will not break from the line of non-aligned policy' said John, 'india is still a country full of pride and fame
 main nahin maanati ki apni maujuuda videsh niti kii line se hatakar vah bahut zyada aage jayega
 Some people say that Narendra Modi has already gone very close to America strategically, but in my view it will go a little too far, but India will not move much ahead of its non-aligned policy
 ' Just as 'omar Khayyam's writings on the stone do not change their meaning', in the same way, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, the most important sign of Halism, cannot be criticized only because he glorified the wines from the 'madhushala'
 hamen bhoolanaa nahin chahie ki hindi sahitya main 'halawaad' kii shuruyaat 'chhayavaad' ke turant baad hui thi
 a period of sorrow and despair had passed, and all the sorrows, all the disappointments and all the difficulties of human beings disappeared in the fun of this 'halalism'
 bachaa to sirf prem
 'mandir Masjid Bait Karate, Prem Karati Madhushala' gives more glorification of liquor or exposes the disharmony of religious places, everyone can speak about it according to their thinking, but it is certain that this era has come 'madhushala' is a masterpiece of hallucination, as it became as popular as no other poetic work of that period
 'madhushaala' kaa jitna virodh hua usase kai guna samarthan mila
 Today we are talking about the bar, because its author Harivansh Rai Bachchan was born on 27 November 1907 in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh
 kysth harivansh raay ko bachapan main unki sharaarton ke chalate 'bachchan' kaha jane laga, jise baad main harivansh raay ne apane saath jode rakhaa or harivansh raay bachchan ke naam se hi jane gaye
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan was read in urdu-english, these were the major compositions of Harivansh Rai Bachchan's early education in Urdu
 phir unhone elahabaad vishvavidhyalay se angrezi main em
 a
 kiya
 He was a professor in the English Department of Allahabad University for many years
 baad main cambridge vishvavidhyalay se angrezi ke kavi yeats par pi

 did
 vah kuch samay tak akashwani ke saahitiyik kaaryakramon se bhi jude rahe or phir 1955 main videsh mantralay se hindi visheshgy ke rup main judakar dilli chale aaye
 There are many opinions about the literary significance of Bachchan's poetry, but his singular popularity is beyond dispute
 unki kavitaayen sarvagrahya or sarvapriya hai
 He had already read Urdu, had also translated Khayyam's rubies
 isiilie vah urdu gazalon kii chamak or lachak, sahajata or samvednaa tathaa sidhe dil par asar karne kii uski taaqat se waakif the
 Bachchan gave his voice to the voice of the disturbed, pain-stricken middle class of the years 1935 to 1940
 haalanki bachchan kii ek kitaab 'tera haar' saal 1932 main prakashit ho chuki thi, par 1935 main chhapi 'madhushaala' ko hi unki pehali kitaab mana jaataa he
 With its publication, 'bachchan' dominated the literary world
 'madhushaala', 'madhubala' or 'madhukalash'- ek ke baad ek teen sangrah sheeghra aae jinhen 'halawaad' kaa pratinidhi granth kaha ja saktaa he
 The specialty of Harivansh Rai Bachchan's poems is that despite accepting the drabness of human life, he inspired him to adopt him with a happy heart instead of turning his back on him
 yah ek tarah kaa bhautikwaadi aadhyatm hi to tha
 The entire Indian philosophy has been emphasizing on the concept of 'karmanaye Vadhikaste Ma Faleshu Kadachan'
 jivan palaayanwaad nahin he, kyonki isamen vaastaviktaa kaa asveekaran nahin he, na hi usase bhaagane kii pariklpana he
 It is true that Bachchan's call for drowning includes romanticism and kasak, but his rhetoric is not merely an invitation to do wrong; Nor is the call to commit suicide by being afraid of sorrow
 
 
 unke bulaave main ek masti he, or jivan kii kadavi se kadavi sachai ko khule dil se swikaarne kaa saahas
 Perhaps it was because of his own experience
 jab big bi ne harivansh raay se poocha, 'mujhe paidaa hi kyon kiya', ye mila javababachchan apane tab tak ke jivan main, apane yuvakal ke aadarshon or swapnon ke tuutane ke dansh ko jhel rahe the
 In 1926, at the age of 19, he was married to Shyama Bachchan, who was 14 at the time
 harivansh raay padhai chhodkar rashtriya andolan main qood pade the
 While working as a teacher in a small school, he was drowning in the gap between reality and ideal
 is abhaav kii dasha main patni asaadhya rog se grast ho gayi
 T
 in 1936
 bi se unki maut ho gai
 The poet mind of 'bachchan' became more and more introverted
 kavita sangrah 'nisha nimantran' tathaa 'ekaant sangeet' isi daur kii rachanaaen hai
 Five years later in 1941, Bachchan married Teji Suri, who was involved in theater and singing
 iske baad bachchan ko acchhee naukari bhi mili, saath hi nayaa jeevanasathi bhi, to 'need kaa punarnirmaan' jaisi kavitaaon kii rachana hui
 Teji Bachchan has acted in a number of plays translated 'shakespeare' by Harivansh Rai Bachchan
 saamaanya bolchaal kii bhashaa ko kavita kii garima pradaan karne kaa shrey bachchan ko hi jaataa he
 He also made an extraordinary contribution in strengthening and popularizing the tradition of Kavi Sammelan in Hindi through poetry
 is tarah ve apane pathakon-shrotaaon ke or bhi nikat aa gayi
 Apart from poetry, he also wrote and translated critical essays
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki shaayad anuwaad ne unke kavi man or karm ko or bhi gaharaai se ubhaara
 This is reflected in his own words as well
 umr khayyam kii rubaayiyon ke anuwaad ke samay harivansh raay bachchan ne ek lambii bhoomika likhi thi, uske kuch ansh yon hai:umr khayyam ke naam se meri pehali jaan-pahchaan kii ek badi mazedaar kahani he
 When i had known Umar Khayyam's name about 25 years from now, i would have been in the third or fourth position of Vernacular Upper Primary
 hamaare pitaaji 'saraswati' mangaya karte the
 My and my younger brother's first job when the magazine arrived was to open it and look at his pictures
 un dinon rangeen tasviir ek hi chapa karti thi, par sade chitra, photo ityadi kai rahete the
 Looking at the pictures, we used to eagerly look forward to the day when Dad and his friends read it and set it aside
 aisa hote-hote duusare maheene kii 'saraswati' aane kaa samay aa jaataa tha
 After those people had read, both of us brothers used to take their scissors and knives together with 'saraswati', like the students of medical college with the dead
 ek-ek karke sari tasviren kaat lete the
 After cutting the photos, the price of the magazine would have seemed even more to us
 chitron ke kaatane main jaldbaaji karne ke liye, ab tak yaad he, pitaaji ne kai baar 'goshmali' bhi kii thi
 It was a matter of those days, in a month of 'saraswati' a colorful portrait was printed - there was a picture of an old Muslim, mourning from the face; It was printed below - Omar Khayyam
 rubaaiyaat ke kis bhav ko dikhaane ke liye yah chitra banaaya gaya tha, iske bare main kuch nahin kah saktaa, is samay chitra kii koi baat yaad nahin he, sivaa iske ki ek boodha muslim baitha he or uske chehre par shok kii chaaya he
 Both of us saw the picture together and read 'umar Khayyam' below
 mere chote bhai mujhase puch pade, "bhai, umr khayyam kya he?" ab mujhe bhi nahin maaloom tha ki umr khayyam ke kya maane hai
 But i grew up, i should know more
 jo baat use nahin maaloom he, vah mujhe maaloom he, yahi dikhaakar to main apane bade hone kii dhak us par jamaa saktaa tha
 i was not going to miss
 mere guruji ne yah mujhe bahut pehle sikhaa rakhaa tha ki chup baithne se galat jawaab dena acha he
 i ran my wisdom and looking at the picture, he said, "look, this old man is saying - Omar Khayyam, which means 'umar Khatyam', that is, Omar ends, thinking that the old man is sorry
 " un dinon sanskrit bhi padhaa karata tha
 Some of the 'decay' must have been found in 'khayyam' and something like that must have come to my mind
 baat tali, maine man main apni peeth thonki, ham or tasveeron ko dekhne main lag gayi
 But the younger brother had to choose such an area of life in the future, where everything needs to be known only properly
 jahaan kalpana, anumaan yaa kayaas ke liye sui kii nok ke baraabar bhi jagah nahin he
 From the boyhood, he used to practice to know everything properly
 unhen kuch aisa abhas hua ki main baper uda rahaa hoon
 Asked father in the evening
 pitaaji ne jo kuch batalaaya use sunakar main jhenp gaya
 To further increase my blush, the younger brother said, "but the brother says that this old man says that Omar is finished - Omar Khayyam i
e
 Omar Khatyam
" " pitaaji pehle to hanse, par phir gambheer ho gayi; mujhase bole, "tum thik kehete ho, boodha sachmuch yahi kahata he
 "that day i understood that father had said this to keep my mind, in fact my thought was wrong
 umr khayyam kii vah tasviir bahut dinon tak mere kamare kii diwaar par tangi rahi
 In the world, how many lively pictures can be found in two days after getting glowed, in the life of Omar Khayyam, how many days could remain his celebrity! The picture of Omar Khayyam was erased but left an indelible mark on my heart
 umr khayyam or umr khatam hoti he, yah donon baat mere man main ek saath jud gayin
 Since then whenever i heard or heard the name of 'umar Khayyam', the same piece in my heart, 'umar khatiyam hai' echoed
 yah to maine baad main janaa ki apni galat sujh main bhi maine in do baton main ek bilkul thik sambandh bana liya tha
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan was awarded the 'sahitya Academy Award' for his work 'do Chattane'

 But advised that the BCCI conduct the election only after the decision

 But the court adjourned it and fixed Friday as the day for hearing

 Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran submitted the report on 3 November on behalf of the Mudgal Committee to the court in a sealed envelope
 jaj ties thakur kii bench ko saunpe gai report main gopneeyata banaae rakhane kii baat kahi gai thi
 The committee was appointed by Judge AK Patnaik to investigate the matter in October 2013
 patnayak 2 june ko ritair ho gaye hai
 According to the rules of IPL, if any officer associated with any team is found involved in wrong activities then his franchise will be dismissed
 rajasthan royles ke saath bhi kuch aisa hi he
 If you want a healthy life with longevity, then make exercise a part of your everyday life, because exercising not only reduces weight, but also reduces stress
 saath hi eksrasij karne se umr bhi lambii hoti he
 This fact has been proved in many study reports
 lekin kuch logon ke liye apni biji life se eksrasij ke liye samay nikaalnaa behad mushkil hota he
 But you do not need to panic, because we are telling you an exercise, which will give you the same benefit of exercising even more by exercising less time
 canada ke shodhakartaaon ke mutabik, sirf ek minute hai intencity eksrasij karne se sharir ko 45 minute tak jogging yaa lo intencity eksrasij karne ke baraabar hi phayda pahunchataa he
 Also the muscles are strong
 shodhakartaaon ne is study ke dauraan 25 motaape se peedit logon kijaanchaki
 In this, he asked all the people involved in the study to do an exercise test in which he had to sprint
 is test ke liye shodhakartaaon ne sabhi logon ko 2 group main baanta
 In this, a group had to sprint like high intensity exercise after every 10 minutes continuously for 12 weeks
 vahiin, duusare group ne ghanton pasinaa bahaakar lo intencity eksrasij kii
 After 12 weeks, the health of the heart along with the muscles of all those involved in the study were also examined
 nateezon main saamne aayaa ki jin logon ne sirf 1 minute hai intencity eksrasij kii unako bhi utana hi phayda hua, jitna ghanton tak lo intencity eksrasij karne waalon ko hua
 This clearly shows that by doing high intensity exercise in a short period of time, the body gets the same benefit as it is by sweating in the gym for hours, doing low intensity exercise
 a post shared by Mallika Sherawat (@mallikasherawat) on Jun 20, 2018 at 12:54am PDT Poonam Sinha, wife of actor-mp Shatrughan Sinha, who left the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and joined Congress, joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Tuesday
 thodi der baad hi unhen lakhanu sansadeey seat se utaarne kaa faisla bhi kar liya gaya
 Dimple Yadav, wife of SP national president Akhilesh Yadav, gave Poonam Sinha SP membership
 lakhanu loksabhaa seat ke raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhen to badi aabaadi muslim samudaay kii he
 Muslim 20 per cent, Scheduled Castes 14
 5 fisadi, brahman 8 fisadi, rajput 7 fisadi or obisi 28 fisadi hai
 Apart from this, there are 10 percent Vaishya voters, which comprise about 4 percent of Sindhi society
 vahiin anya 12 fisadi matadaata hai jinamein 3 fisadi kysth hai
 The Lucknow parliamentary seat has five assembly seats and all are currently occupied by the BJP
 69 varsh kii punam sinha purv main model or heroin rah chuki hai
 He has had no involvement in politics before this election
 isi saal unhone raajnneeti main entry kii or sapa ne unhen apane tikat par loksabhaa chunaav ladaane kaa faisla kiya
 However, her husband Shatrughan Sinha has been a strong leader of the BJP and has also taken charge of the Union Minister
 bijepi se matbhedon ke kaaran unhone abhi haal main party chhod di or apane sansadeey ilaake patna sahib se congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 The mobilization of sindhi-kayastha votes is being cited as the key reason behind giving tickets to Poonam Sinha from Lucknow
 hyderabad main paidaa punam sinha sindhi samudaay se aati hai or jinka naam punam chandiramani he
 After marrying Shatrughan Sinha, he came to be called as Poonam Sinha
 lakhanu nirvachan kshetra khaskar shahari ilaake main sindhi or kysth voton kii acchhee khaasi sankhya he jise dekhte hue sapa ne punam sinha ko gathbandhan kaa ummidavaar banaaya he
 However, they are being accused of being outsiders, which could affect the votes
 rajnath singh ko lakhanu main muslimon ke alaava kysth or sindhi jaise samudaayon kaa bhi puraa samarthan miltaa rahaa he
 There has never been any apprehension about Hindu votes, but this time the SP has taken a strategy to make Rajnath Singh dependent on Hindu votes only by applying the sindhi-kayastha equation
 sapa ke saath is baar bispi kaa gathbandhan he, isliye muslim voton kaa thok main udhar shift hona lajimi he
 Therefore, the SP has made a strategy to take Poonam Sinha out of Lucknow and imprison the BJP to a limited extent
 sutron kii maane to shatrughna sinha ne pichley dinon sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se mulaakaat ke dauraan punam ke liye loksabhaa kaa tikat maanga tha
 SP wanted Shatrughan Sinha to join the Congress first, so that a common opposition candidate from Lucknow seat is in the fray
 congress ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke liye saat siten chhodane kii baat kahi thi
 Lucknow seat was one of them
 vipaksh lakhanu seat par rajnath singh ko kadi chunauti dena chahta tha
 Therefore, he wanted to jointly field Rajnath Singh by fielding candidates
 65 saal kii punam sinha ne shuruaati dinon main kuch bollywood filmon main kaam kiya tha lekin saal 1980 main shatrughna se shaadi karne ke baad unhone rupahale parde se puri tarah kinaaraa kar liya
 They have two sons, Luv and Kush
 punam ne komal naam se hindi filmon main kadam rakhaa tha
 Prior to appearing in films, she was also the winner of the Miss Young India competition
 isi ke baad unhone bollywood main entry kii thi
 She made her comeback to Bollywood a few years ago with Ashutosh Gowariker's film Jodha Akbar

 chhattisgarh mempradhanmantri narendra modiki ek maatr jansabha ke elaan ke baadacongresane bhartiya janata party (bijepi) par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa he
 The Congress claims that the magic of Prime Minister Modi is now over
 isliye unki reliyon kii sankhya kam kar di gai hai, jabaki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main modi ne 13 jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 The Congress claims that in Chhattisgarh, the BJP is engaged in the exercise of crossing its eyes on the basis of Chief Minister Raman Singh
 raman singh rojaanaa aadha darjan se zyada jan sabhaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe hai
 The Congress feels that the entire assembly elections are on the shoulders of Raman Singh, and the party has cut Prime Minister Modi's public meetings
 haalanki bijepi ke rashtriya str ke netaa or kendriya mantri bhi vibhinn vidhaan sabha kshetron main reliyaan kar rahe hai
 But the Congress has targeted Prime Minister Modi, saying that the reason for his lack of previous general meetings in Chhattisgarh is his constantly declining popularity and credibility
 modi kii ek maatr sabha 9 november ko bastar main hogi
 This will be the last day of campaigning for the first round of voting in the state
 pehle daur main modi kii ek maatr jan sabha ko lekar congress ne un par tikhaa hamalaa bolaa he
 According to the Congress, now neither people come to listen to Modi as before, nor now they have the same magic as before
 isliye soch samaj kar bijepi ne unki jansabhaon kii sankhya kam kar di he
 The BJP does not agree with the plea of the Congress
 party kaa tark he ki modi bataur pradhanmantri beete paanch saalon main kai baar rajya ke vibhinn hisson kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Senior Congress leader Arvind Netamka says that if Modi had public meetings, the Congress would have benefited
 unke mutabik bijepi ne soch samaj kar pehle daur main sirf unki ek maatr aamasabha rakhi
 This is just food
 unki daleel he ki bijepi karaari haar se bachanaa chaahati he
 So now Modi is being held back
 udhar bijepi pravaktaa gaurishankar shrivas kaa kahana he ki congress apni haar se bachane ke liye is tarah ke mudde oochaal rahi he
 He said that in front of the bjp's development issue neither of them are facing any charges nor they have any issues
 gaurishankar shrivas kaa yah bhi kahana he ki pradhanmantri modi pichley teen chaar maah main kai baar rajya kaa daura kar chuke he
 Even before this, he has done public meetings in many land development works and foundation stone laying
 aise main congress kaa koi bhi aarope satyata se pare he
 Let us know that the first round of electoral campaigning in Chhattisgarh has gained momentum
 pehle daur main rajya kii 18 vidhansabha siton par 12 november ko vot daale jaaenge
 All these seats will stop campaigning on November 9, while the second round of voting will be held on November 20
 iske liye 17 november prachaar kaa antim din hoga

 It was in 2010 when Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries (RIL), acquired Infotel Broadband from leading telecom player Mahendra Nahata
 company ke paas desh ke 22 parikshetron main broadband spectrum kaa swaamitv tha
 This acquisition was the land on which Ambani was to stand his next big stake in the telecom sector — a service that was proving to be more aggressive and scandalous than his mobile telephone service launched in 2002 at the cost of clowns
 apane vishwast kareebi manoj modi ke saath milakar unhone is hamale kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya
 Modi had to emphasize two key areas: he had to buy state-of-the-art technology and bring together the old war horses of Reliance Infocomm — all the people who had helped him at the time to start a mobile phone service that was "postcard" It was cheaper than that ”(says Dhirubhai Ambani gave his eldest son the same challenging recipe to succeed in the field of telecommunications)
 agle chah saal tak 'duniya ke sabase bade start-ap' ke prasav kii kavayad jari rahi, jiske ant main paidaa hua reliance jeeyo—doorsanchaar udyog main yah ambani kaa doosraa dakhal tha
 This time the breakdown is almost certain: Data packages are being sold at one-fifth of market rates, except for voice, video, music and content, which will be given free to customers for the first four months, starting on September 5
 Has been done since jahaan tak wais sevaaon yani phone kol kaa sawaal he, ve hameshaa mukrat rahengi
 While this Ambani offering to customers is not easily believable, it is a real danger for other telecom companies, whose businesses are still relying on payment-focused voice services
 ise samajhane ke liye itnaa hi kaaphi he ki bazaar main pehle number kii company bharti airtel ke rajasav kaa 70 fisadi hissaa philhal wais kol se aata he (dekhen box: wais ke liye kitni keemat)
 India is one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the asia-pacific region
 research form idisi ke mutabik, yahaan 2015 main kareeb 10 karod 36 lakh smartphone bik chuke hai, jo 2014 ke mukaable 28
 8 percent growth
 internet upabhoktaaon ke maamle main bhi bharat doosraa sabase bada desh he, jinaki sankhya philhal 27
 7 crores, which is less than China but more than America
 yah baat alag he ki yahaan doorsanchaar sevaaon kii gunvattta main kaaphi kami rah gai he
 Most of the customers have complained and are struggling with 'call drop'
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki bhartiya doorsanchaar companiyon ne graahakon kii sankhya main ijaphe kaa laabh uthaane ke saath uske hisaab se spectrum or tower jaise nirnaayak dhaanche main paryaapt nivesh nahin kiya he
 As a result, in high-rise buildings, on highways, in trains, in the metro, calls are either cut off due to limited spectrum with the operator, because they are unable to send their waves to long distances or tall buildings or because of the use of data by consumers The increase in the capacity of telecom towers reduces the impact on voice services
 ambani jaanate the ki choubison ghante soshal media or soochnaaon kii aadi ho chuki ek peedi ke liye zyada sasti or shashakt seva kaa aakarshan nazarandaaj karnaa mushkil hoga
 Once, he was deceived, so he did not want to repeat the mistakes that had made his first telecom venture a failure
 isiilie unhone bhavishya kii praudyogiki eltii main baari nivesh kiya: eltii (long turm evolution) adhiktar mobile upkarnon ke liye upyukt or sahaj he (dekhen box: eltii ko aise samajhen)
 They also decided that the back-up structure should be sufficiently established and for this, tied up with contract producers such as Taiwanese company Foxconn to make equipment that was cheap and comfortable to operate
 or ant main sabase ahm kaam unhone yah kiya ki tarriff daron par aakhri daanv khelaa, jisase wais kol hameshaa ke liye ni:shulk ho gai—or data kifayati, haalanki is par ab tak matbhed kaayam hai
 In a freelance and negotiating market, the plan gave the address (see box: Volt shock: Jio rates, Reliance Jio: offering)
 duusari doorsanchaar companiyon airtel, vodaphone or idia ne bhi 4ji eltii sevaayen shuru kar di hai, lekin reliance jeeyo iklauti seva he jiskaa samoochaa network eltii sakasham he
 Reliance has also invested heavily in fiber optic cabling for high quality data transfer
 iske alaava, ab tak sirf jeeyo or airtel kii hi 4ji sevaayen puure bharat main hai
 Jio is the only company with voice over LTE (volte) technology
 yah wais data ke hastantaran ke liye internet aadhaarit praudyogiki he, jo behatar kol gunvattta ko sunishchit karti he
 Its goal is to create 100 million subscribers in the first year of operations and then add more customers by retaining them
 yah china kii sarkari mobile phone company china mobile kii tarj par banaaya gaya lakshya he (china mobile ne 2014 main shuru karke mahaj dedh saal kii avadhi main 40 karod upabhoktaaon ko eltii sevaaon kaa graahak bana diya, kisi maheene main to isane 2
 2 to 2 3 karod graahak banaae)
 The same has happened in South Korea and Australia, which are rapidly moving towards a pure 4G network by completely eliminating 2G and 3G
 bharat main sabase pehle 4ji seva shuru karne vaali company bharti airtel thi, jisane agast 2015 main 296 shaharon main ise shuru kiya
 As of December 2015, Bharti has invested Rs 40,000 crore in the sector
 kaa nivesh kar diya tha
 Aditya Birla's company Idea started 4G in December 2015 and Vodafone in February this year
 upabhokta haalanki kaaphi dhire-dhire 4ji seva par aa rahe hai kyonki iske saath bhi unhen vahi samasya aa rahi he jo 3ji main thi—data kaa kharaab sanchaar
 It seems that Ambani was sitting in the eyes of this opportunity
 mumbai main 1 sitambar ko ariel ke shairdharakon kii salanaa aam baithak (agm) main 59 varshiya ambani ne kaha, ''mobile broadband internet seva ke maamle main duniya ke 230 deshon ke bich bharat aaj 155wein sthaan par he
 Jio has come to replace it
 mujhe koi shaq nahin he ki jeeyo ko shuru karne ke saath bharat kaa sthaan sheersh das main hoga
 "the audience welcomed it fiercely, but not the market, as investors were worried about the move
" iske chalate ariel ke share us din 2
 729 dived to Rs 1029
 ke kareeb pahunch gaye or uske bazaar moolyankan ko 9,400 karod ru
 Lime started
 dar yah tha ki bina is spashtataa ke ki paisa kab tak vasuul ho paaegaa, itane aakraamak nivesh se ariel na sirf pratidwandviyon ke bich khun-kharaba machaa degi balki aane vaale samay main jald hi apane pairon par bhi kulhadi maar legi
 Beginning with access to cheap and high quality data, it is now expected that the entire services will be faster and the implications will be longer
 mana ja rahaa he ki digital praudyogiki ke sust anukulan ke chalate i-governans, i-larning or i-healthcare jaise kai shabd jo kriyanvayan kii prakriya main hi lupt ho gaye the, ve ab fal-phool sakenge
 Ambani did not miss any opportunity to link his plans with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream 'digital India', though he had to pay a small price
 agm ke agle din rashtriya akhabaaron ke pehle panne par jeeyo kaa ek vigyaapan prakashit hua, jisamen pradhanmantri kii tasviir lagi thi
 This was severely criticized on social media, as it seemed that the Prime Minister was publicly promoting the company's product
 ariel ke adhikariyon ke mutabik, unhen vigyaapan main pradhanmantri kii tasviir kaa istemaal galat nahin jaan padaa
 In support of this, he said that many examples of this variety exist
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki ariel is vivaad se batch sakati thi
 There are 90 million active mobile phone users in India (90 million active SIM cards is a far more accurate figure) of which around 25
 4 karod ko airtel sevaayen detii he (dekhen chart)
 19 among other big players
 8 karod graahakon ke saath vodaphone, 17
 Idea and 10 with 5 crores
 1 karod ke saath arcom maujuud he
 As they do in other businesses, even in the case of Jio, Ambani is betting on a lower price and a bigger size and thus breaking into the market, shocking rivals and provoking potential customers
 - At least that is it
 mana ja rahaa he ki jeeyo mobile broadband bazaar ko 2020 tak 65 karod upabhokta kaa lakshya puraa karne main madad degaa
 After Ambani's much publicized speech, Mahindra Group President Anand Mahindra tweeted, "13 by 2020
" 2 karod se 65 karod mobile broadband upabhoktaaon kii sankhya pahunchane ke liye kranti kii jarurat he
 It has started with Reliance Jio
 ''paraamarsh form kepiemji india ke partner romal shetty kehete hai, ''bhram main mat rahiye, yah ek jang he
 "they say," Instantly, for three to four months everything is free
 yah agar ek se do karod graahakon ke liye bhi he to yah bazaar main vighn paidaa kar saktaa he
 "it can bring down the revenue of competing companies, which account for three-fourths of total revenue from voice services
" ve kehete hai, ''agle saal dedh saal tak duusari companiyon ko dard hota rahegaa
 According to reports, there are only 7 million 4G subscribers in India and this share is growing at a rate of 10 to 15 per cent
 bharat main 3ji ko logon ne 2ji ke mukaable kam apanaaya he or iske kareeb 30 karod graahak hai
 Former Infosys CFO and Manipal Education Chairman T
 ve
 Says Mohandas Pai, "reliance Jio will rejuvenate India, provide huge data capacity to every Indian, build a virtual nation and pester competitors who offer loose services
" ''wais kol muft dene or data kii keemat prachlit daron se kaaphi neeche rakhane kaa dabaav maujuuda companiyon par padegaa or ve bhi apni daren giraayengi
 Says a research report by CRISIL, "we anticipate that companies will switch to Sahaj plans, where customers will be provided unlimited voice and data in a lump sum, rather than the obscure options that are in practice nowadays
" '' rapat kahati he ki iskaa matlab daron main aane vaali teevr giravat he, jiske chalate sthapit companiyon ko data se aane vaala rajasav vitt varsh 2017-18 tak aadha ho jayega
 Reliance Jio will accelerate India's transition from 2G to 4G and enable its transition to a data economy where voice services are priced in the form of data
 inarshia velth creatrs elelpi ke shobhit khare kehete hai, ''jeeyo jo riyaayat de rahaa he, vah kaaphi ahm he
 If other companies were able to come up to it, it would have a negative impact on their financial condition
 istemaal to jaahir taur par badhegaa
 From here onwards war of tariffs is seen
 ''yah alag he, lekin kaise?reliance jeeyo duusari companiyon kii sevaaon se alag kaise he? iske kai pahalu hai
 One is technology itself
 eltii ek swatantra or nai takanic he jo maujuuda pranaaliyon se bhinn network par kaam karti he
 All earlier systems were crisis-based while this is based on IP or Internet protocols, in which data is sent as 'packets'
 iske chalate eltii data sanchaar ke maamle main zyada sakasham takanic ho jaati he
 As capacity increases, it becomes possible to deliver services to many others and with better quality than before
 yah praudyogiki graahakon ko dene ke liye infrastracchar maujuud hona chahie
 The basic elements of any mobile network are spectrum or airwaves
 ariel ne 2300 megahertz band main (ek aisi frequency jisase eltii telephoni sevaayen prasaarit ho sakati hai) akhil bhartiya spectrum 2010 main hi hasil kar liya tha
 Later in 2014 it bought the 1800 mhz band (which is considered more suitable for LTE services) and in 2015 bought more spectrum in the 800 and 1800 mhz bands, making these two bands in 20 circles in 22 circles across the country
 His presence was made
 doorsanchaar main nichali frequency ke band zyada kargar hote hai kyonki dhwani tarangen ucch frequency band ke mukaable in bandon main zyada duuri tay kar paati hai
 Airtel is currently able to offer 4G services in 15, Idea 10 and Vodafone eight circles as compared to the capacity of Jio
 jeeyo apane samooche spectrum kaa istemaal eltii sevaaon ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin uske pratidwandvi, jo apane maujuuda spectrum kaa istemaal 2ji or 3ji seva ke liye kar rahe hai, unke paas 4ji ke liye kshamta kam rah jaaegi
 An alternative is that these companies buy more spectrum in the auction to be held in October, but it will be a costly deal
 ek anya vikalp 2ji or 3ji sevaaon ko band karne kaa he taaki eltii ko zyada jagah di ja sake, lekin yah vikalp vyaavhaarik or mumkin nahin he, kyonki 3ji ko bhi kaaphi ho-halle ke saath shuru kiya gaya tha lekin aaj tak kai jagahon par uski kawarej maujuud nahin he, isliye kabhi-kabhaar 2ji ke aasare hi kol lag paati he, jiske kaaran kai baar kol bich main katati he
 Advantage of the technology Another advantage of Jio comes from its fiber optic cable network, which has huge data capacity and can also be used later for 5G (the next important step proposed for mobile telecom standards)
 company ne teen lakh circuit kilometre lambey fibre optic cabel bicha rakhe hai (kai jagahon par trephic ke apekshit ghanatv ke chalate prati kilometre cabel kii kai paraten bichaai gai hai)
 "we can move 800 million GB of data in a month," says a company official
 agar har bhartiya prati maah 10 jibi kaa bhi upbhog kare to hamaara network use saport kar saktaa he
 The restriction with other companies is that they have invested heavily in 3G networks
 doorsanchaar operataron ne 2010 main desh ke 22 doorsanchaar cirkilon ke liye 3ji nilaamee par 67,719 karod ru
 Were spent
 inamen adhiktar ko 3ji se ab bhi yah kharch nikaalnaa he jabaki bharat main fibre optic bichaana kaaphi jatil kaam he
 It requires a lot of hard work and patience
 sthaneey nikaayon kii manzooriyaan or aupchaarik va anaupchaarik adhikaron ko praapt karnaa kaaphi jatil kaam he, jiske chalate kai oparator aadhe raste main hi dam tod dete hai
 Jio will also get an advantage that its cost on telecom towers has been very low
 jeeyo kaa 4ji network 18,000 shaharon or kasbon tathaa do lakh se zyada gaanvon ko cover karegaa
 For this, it has a network of 92,000 towers, of which 42,000 towers are its own
 company ne in nae paryaavaran hitaishi toweron par kisi tarah aath se nau lakh ru
 It has been successful in raising the cost per tower while the average cost per tower in the industry is Rs 30-32 lakh
 he
 One reason is that the company uses smaller towers that consume less land and are more energy efficient
 jeeyo or tower laga rahaa he
 It hopes to cover 90 per cent of India by March next year

 Rating firm Fitch says that although RIL has spent heavily on the project, it has been profitable in the near future, due to lack of penetration of 4g-enabled devices, as opposed to lower customer base
 But the company will have to bear the brunt in the beginning

 Even then it is likely to change rapidly, as more than 70 percent of new handsets are now 4G, but it is unlikely that Jio will have more than 2-3 crore subscribers and more than 3-4 percent revenue market share by next year
 Will be able to gather '' yah company ke sanchaalan ke pehle saal main 10 karod ke lakshya se kaaphi kam hoga

 The reason behind this thinking is also clear
 in halaat main bhartiya ballebaaji sarvshereshth najar aati he
 Ashwin at number 9 means batting is long
 lekin, sher-e-bangla stadium kii hari ghaas vaali oochaal bhari pich par raftaar kaa waar jab 8-9 feet oonchai se hoga, to is sarvshereshth ballebaaji kaa test bhi hoga
 The comments ek ke baad ek teen baane haath ke gendbaajon kaa hamalaa, raftaar bhi 90 mile prati ghanta ke kareeb kii hogi
 Let's understand this in a little detail
 mohammad irfan- kad 7 feet 1 inch, matlab gend kareeb 9 feet kii oonchai se phenki jaaegi
 Mohammad Aamir - Height 6 feet 2 inches, the ball will be thrown from about 8 feet
 wahaab riyaj- kad 6 feet 1 inch, ek baar phir gend 8 feet se aegi
 If Mohammed Sami, who is in excellent form, is also added to this, then Indian batting may face more difficulties
 pakistan kii koshish pehle 6 overon main phayda uthaane kii hogi
 If there is a bounce, then the attack is also likely to be short pitch bowling
 ab is oonchai se agar gend phenki jaaegi or short pich gendbaazi hui to, bhartiya ballebaaji ko dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 In such a situation, it is certain that the match is going to be exciting and for the Indian team, the sensible Rohit showed in the first match, the rest of the batsmen will also have to execute it
 is soch ke peeche vajah bhi saaf he
 In these circumstances, Indian batting seems to be the best
 number 9 par aswin kaa aana matlab ballebaaji lambii he
 But, when the speed of speed will be from 8-9 feet on the green grassy bouncy pitch of sher-e-bangla Stadium, then this best batting test will also happen
 tippaniyan Three left-handed bowlers attack one after the other, the speed will also be close to 90 miles per hour
 is baat ko thodaa vistaar se samajhate hai- Mohammad Irfan - 7 feet 1 inch, means the ball will be thrown from a height of about 9 feet
 mohammad aamir- kad 6 feet 2 inch, gend phenki jaaegi kareeb 8 feet se
 Wahab Riaz - 6 feet 1 inch tall, once again the ball will come from 8 feet
 isamen agar shandaar form main chal rahe mohammad sami bhi jud gaye, to bhartiya ballebaaji ko or mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa saktaa he
 Pakistan will try to take advantage in the first 6 overs
 oochaal he, to hamalaa short pich gendbaaji kaa hone ke bhi asaar hai
 If the ball will be bowled from this height and short pitch bowling, then Indian batting may face problems
 aise main ek baat tay he ki muqabla romaanchak hone vaala he or bhartiya team ke liye pehle match main jo sujh-boojh rohit ne dikhaai thi, baaki ballebaajon ko bhi us par amal karnaa hoga

 The election of Karnataka can have a decisive impact on the politics of the country
 agar congress jitati he, jaisaa ki use lagata he, to is baat ke kaaphi asaar hai ki saal ke ant main desh main 5 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke saath aam chunaav ho jaaenge
 But away from the concerns of Delhi, Karnataka is having a dull election
 jab 5 may ko karnataka main matdaan hoga, tab nirnaayak prabhaav daalane laayak koi sthaneey kaddavar netaa nahin hoga
 This time there is no playing wave in the electoral field, nor is there rain of black or red money coming out of the mines
 na takhtiyaan, na poster or na koi nukkad sabha
 In almost 100 assembly constituencies, the Congress has a marginal edge without any hard work
 lekin yah kah paanaa mushkil he ki congress is phaayde ko saadhaaran bahumat main bhunaa legi or chunaav ke baad gathbandhan kii yaatnaaon se batch jaaegi
 The Bellary mining scam has eliminated the mine owner and former BJP legislator Gali Jardan Reddy and his pawns

 Surrounded by allegations of scams and malfeasance, the BJP changed the Chief Minister twice in five years to save credibility
 phir bhi rajya ke kai hisson main buree tarah saakh ganvaai
 bjp's weary chief minister, 57-year-old Jagdish Shettar, admits, "it is a big challenge to convince people that we are not really corrupt parties
" ’’ unhone yah baat rajya ke hawaii chunavi daure main helicopter se utarate samay kahi thi
 Shettar claims that most of the Lingayats, about 17 per cent of the total population, are with the BJP as in 1990, but Yeddyurappa has already dealt a tremendous blow to the BJP already facing anti-incumbency

 There is no indication that the campaign of national leaders of BJP including Narendra Modi on April 28 will somehow save the party

 It is necessary for the Congress to win in Karnataka and consolidate its strength
 sirf isliye nahin, ki rajya se 28 saansad dilli jate hai jo 2014 ke aam chunaav main bahut kaam aa sakate hai, khaskar, isliye bhi ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 19 siten jiti thim
 The victory of the Congress is also necessary to encourage after the defeat in Uttar Pradesh in March 2012 and Gujarat in December 2012
 vaise bhi is varsh madhya pradesh, rajasthan, dilli or chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari he

 17 people were injured in this accident
 police ne ab tak tamilnadu se chaar logon ko shaq ke aadhaar par pakadaa he, jinamein se ek 1998 ke coimbatore dhamaakon ke liye jail kaat chukaa he
 The BJP is not beating this success in the election campaign, because a local leader says that doing so will only help the Congress to get more votes of minorities
 congress netaaon kaa ishaara he ki bijepi ne shaayad sahanubhuti jutaney ke liye khud hi yah dhamaakaa karaayaa hoga
 Seven years later, the Congress office in Karnataka is flooded with ticket seekers and the pressure of leaders in Delhi who are desperate to get a big role in preparing for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, as soon as victory is expected

 It is possible to discuss the Presidential position between the two soon apane punjab daure ke dauraan arvind kejariwal shanivaar raat ko punjab ke moga main gurvinder singh naam ke ek vyakti ke ghar ruke the
 Let me tell you that Gurwinder Singh was the Chief of the Khalistan Liberation Front at one time
 punjab main aatankwaad ke daur main us par hindu-sikh dange bhadakaane ke aarope lage or ek kii hatya or anya kai maamalon main vah jail main bhi rahaa lekin baad main in maamalon se bari hokar wo england chalaa gaya or ab england main baithkar wo kathith taur par khalistaan libration front ke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal's stay at Gurdeep Singh's house has now started a ruckus in the politics of Punjab where another Congress and Akali Dal has once again joined Arvind Kejriwal with anti-punjab and pro-khalistan radical groups and seek help and funding from them If the allegation is repeated, then Hindu organizations of Punjab have also come out openly against Arvind Kejriwal
 june akhaada se jude panchanand giri maharaj jo ki hindu takht ke dharmadhish bhi hai unhone somvaar ko chandigarh mempress conferencekarke arvind kejariwal par khalistaan samarthak radical grups se mili hone kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki protocol ke tahat arvind kejariwal jo ki dilli ke mukhyamantri hai wo sarkari guest house main ruk sakate the, apane kisi aam aadmi party ke netaa ke ghar ruk sakate the lekin phir bhi arvind kejariwal ne nite ste ke liye us gurdeep singh kaa ghar chunaa, jo ki punjab main khalistaan ke liye lagaataar kaam karata rahaa he
 Not only this, he is now sitting in England and doing everything
 panchanand giri maharaj ne saaf kar diya ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main hindu sanghathan khulkar aam aadmi party kaa virodh karenge or logon ko bhi bataaenge ki aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal kis tarah se punjab ko baantne vaali khalistaan samarthak takaton ke saath mili hue hai
 In the case of Arvind Kejriwal's Khalistan Liberation Front terrorist staying in the house, Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh has given clarification on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party
 sanjay singh ne kaha kii arvind kejariwal ke moga main gurdeep singh ke ghar rukne ke kaarykram ke bare main punjab police ko pehle se jaankaree de di gai thi or agar gurdeep singh aatanki he to punjab police ko arvind kejariwal ko us ghar main rukne se rokna chahie tha
 Sanjay Singh also said that Arvind Kejriwal did not know Gurdeep Singh, he had gone to stay in this house at the behest of a person named Satnam Singh, who was associated with Aam Aadmi Party
 sanjay singh ne ye bhi kaha ki gurdeep singh court se tamaam aaropon se bari ho chukaa he to aise main use aatanki nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Sanjay Singh released a photo saying that earlier the Akali Dal and BJP had accused Arvind Kejriwal of meeting another RP Singh person and being a terrorist but the same person in the pictures of Punjab CM Prakash Singh Badal Seated together
 agar arvind kejariwal ke saath baithne vaala vyakti aatanki he to aise main prakaash singh badal ne bhi ek aatanki ke saath meeting kii he or sukhbir badal ko apane pita prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf bhi FIR darj karwaani chahie

 In the pharmacy category also, Jamia University of Delhi has got the second place while the College of Pharmacy, Manipal in the first place
 sansthaanon ko deni padikdi parikshine sansthaanon ko kai paramiters kii jaanch ke baad rekking list me alag alag sthaan mili hai
 These included facilities, research work, number of students studying in major institutions
 sansthaanon ko kaha gaya tha ki bachche santhaan main padhane aate hai, logon kii inke bare main kya soch he jaisi kai or baton kaa aankalan karke ye ranking suchi jari kii gai he

 khaastaur par wo students jo baahar se hamaare desh me padhane aate he or unhen sansthaanon ke bare main kahin se koi sahi jaankaree nahi mil paati he
 SP and Baspane have denied any alliance with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly elections
 jabaki basapa chhattisgarh main ajit jogi kii party se saath gathjod kar maidan main utari he
 While the Congress is contesting alone in all three states
 sapa-basapa kaa congress ke saath na aana rahul gandhi ke vipakshi ekta ko jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 However, the Congress fully hopes that the mahagathbandhan will be held before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections next year and both the major parties of UP will be a part of it
 lekin basapa adhyakshamayawatike tevar congress ke prati jis tarah se garam hai, aise main congress ke saath basapa ke saath aegi is par tasviir abhi saaf nahin he
 At the same time, SP President Akhilesh Yadav does not want to leave the BSP in any way
 iske liye wo lagaataar naram ravaiya akhriyaar kiye hue hai
 Not only this, Akhilesh is talking about going to any extent to compromise the BSP, but his strictness about the Congress remains intact
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne mangalvaar ko kaha he ki unki party ne chunavi gathbandhan ke liye sammanjanak siten milane kaa ek maatr shart rakhi thi
 He said that in the coming elections, no party will be begging for seats for the alliance and will continue to contest on its own
 mayawati bijepi or congress ko baraabar kaa doshi tehraate hue kaha ki congress or bhaajapa, donon hi partiyaan bispi, iske netritv ko kamjor or badnaam karne ke liye hameshaa prayasarat rahati hai
 It is clear from Mayawati's statements that she is as angry with the Congress as she is angry with the ruling BJP
 sapa-basapa isi tarah kaa ravaiya agar upi main bhi akhriyaar karti hai to congress ke liye soobe main apane vajood ko bachaae rakhana mushkil sabit ho saktaa he
 While SP and BSP together, there seems to be a possibility of contesting elections
 pichley dinon upi ke phulpur, gorakhpur or kairana loksabhaa ke upachunaav main iskaa test bhi dekha ja chukaa he, jahaan basapa ne apane ummidavaar nahin utaare the or sapa ke ummidavaaron ne do to areldi ke candidet ne ek seat par jeet darj kii thi
 Senior Congress leader m Veerappa Moily said on Tuesday that the parties have their own obligations in the state elections
 hamaari pramukh ichha loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh ko ekajute dekhne kii he or hamen ummid he ki is lakshya ko praapt kar lenge
 It is believed that SP and BSP will be part of this grand alliance
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue mayawati ke sanket congress ke liye or bhi badi mushkil khadi kar sakati hai
 Why the BSP may not have a single Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh at present, but in the coming days, the alliance of SP and BSP can isolate the Congress
 mayawati ke is faisle se sabase zyada phaayde main bijepi dikh rahi he
 Actually, the atmosphere that was being created about the grand alliance with the decision of Maya will not be made
 iskaa sidhaa asar bijepi ke virodh main khadey matadaataaon par padegaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections for BJP, these are good signs that BSP, Congress and SP are not ready at the moment to form an alliance
 uttar pradesh main kul 80 loksabhaa siten hai
 The BJP alliance won 73 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its mission was successful 272 plus
 jabaki basapa kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha
 At the same time, the Congress was limited to Rae Bareli and Amethi and the SP could win only five seats of its family, but after the by-elections in three seats, BJP currently has 68, SP has 7 and RLD has one MP

 When the villagers asked Bhuri Singh and Indrajit the reason for Rajvir's death, they lied that Rajvir Singh died after falling from the roof

 But the villagers did not digest them and informed the police about this
 soochna milte hi police gaanv main aa gai
 And after taking the information of the case, the deceased's father Indrajit Singh and grandfather Bhuri Singh were taken into custody
 police ne mauka-e-vaardaat par ennesail team ko bhi bula liya or maamle kii jaanch main jute gai
 Manoj Jatav, sarpanch of Khori village told that Bhuri Singh, father of Indrajit Singh, is a tantric
 wo jameen ke andar gade dhan ko nikaalane ke liye tantra vidha kaa kaam karata he
 Bhuri Singh, along with his son Inderjit Singh, also tried to sacrifice his elder grandson Balwant Singh, but Balwant Singh does not sleep at his house after finding out
 wo gaanv main kisi or ke yahaan rahata he
 But late in the night, both of them made little grandson Rajveer Singh Konarbalika a victim
 narbali kii is ghatana ke baad puure gaanv main hadakamp machaa hua he
 Bhusawar CO Mahesh Sharma said that on the information of the villagers, police reached the village and found that the young man had been murdered and cremated in a secret manner

 An article published in China's official newspaper Global Times said that the growing relationship between the US and China could further improve economic relations between India and China
 bharat un kuch deshon main he jo chini bazaar main america utpaadon ke aayaat main kami aane kaa phayda uthaa sakate hai
 US President Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would increase tariffs on Chinese goods, importing the prospect of a trade deal with China
 unki is ghoshnaa se hi vaishvik bazaaron main giravat aani shuru ho gai or iske baad baari utaar-chadhaav dekha gaya
 Trump wrote in this tweet - For the last 10 months China has been giving 25 percent tariff on high-tech goods worth $ 50 billion and 10 percent tariff on other items worth $ 200 billion to the US
 yah bhugtan kuch had tak hamaare jabardast aarthik nateezon ke liye jimmedaar he
 This 10 percent will now increase to 25 percent from Friday
 china ko bheje jane vaale 325 arab dollar kii atirikt vastuon par koi tex nahin lagata, lekin ab in par 25 fisadi tex lagaaya jayega
 For 10 months, China has been paying tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods
 These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results
 The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday
 325 Billions Dollars

 dilli sarkaar ne guest teachers ke liye nai policy ko cabinet kii baithak main paas kar diya he
 On Wednesday, the government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at the Delhi Secretariat on the issue of guest teachers
 baithak ke baad shiksha mantri ne bataaya ki dilli sarkaar ne nai policy banaai he, jise wo khud alji anil baijal ko saunpane ja rahe hai
 Manish Sisodia told during the press conference after the cabinet meeting that at present there are posts of 64,000 teachers in all government schools, while only 58,000 teachers are working
 inamen guest teachers kii sankhya 22,000 he
 Those who have been appointed on merit basis from time to time
 sisodiya ne daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar aane se pehle har saal guest teachers ko nae sire se bhartee prakriya se guzarana padataa tha lekin aam aadmi party sarkaar ne har saal kii bhartee prakriya ko khatm kar diya
 He also said that the guest teachers used to get salary from very low 10-12 thousand to 17 thousand rupees, which has been increased by our government to 35 thousand
 unhone aage alji or centre sarkaar par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki teachers rakhana, teachers hataanaa, kis skool main kitne teacher honge ye services kaa maamla he
 The elected government will build schools, run schools
 padhai karavaaegi lekin skool main kitne teacher honge, ye centre sarkaar kaise tay kar sakati he
 The question is how the schools will run in such a situation
 manish sisodiya ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki dilli sarkaar cabinet main sarkaar ke saath kaam karne vaale tamaam guest teachers ke liye ek policy laai he
 Under which all guest teachers will now work till the age of retirement of regular teachers and they will not be removed
 dilli main regular teachers kii ritairement kii umr 60 saal he
 Apart from this, only conduct rules with regular teachers will be applicable to guest teachers
 manish sisodiya ne press conference main daawa kiya ki pichley 2 saal se wo guest teachers ko pakkaa karne kii guhaar centre sarkaar se laga rahe hai
 At the same time, Sisodia said that while accusing the BJP that it had passed the bill to permit guest teachers in the Delhi Assembly, but the Central Government did not implement it
 centre kii sarkaar ajukeshan department kaa bhatta bithaane kii sajeesh kar rahi he
 On the viral video of Nahid Hasan, MLA from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh, Mohsin Raza, a minister in the Yogi government, has attacked the Samajwadi Party
 mantri mohsin raja ne kaha he ki sapa vidhayak kaa bayaan danga failaane kii koshish he
 This is the history and character of the Spaniards
 bataa den ki vidhayak nahid hasan kaa ek video viral hua he, jisamen wo logon se bijepi samarthak dukandaaron se saamaan nahin kharidne kii apil kar rahe hai
 Minister Mohsin Raza said that Kairana is the area where there was a migration issue
 wo ilaaka 80 fisadi musalamaanon kaa he, is tarah kaa bayaan dena sajeesh kii taraf ishaara karata he
 He termed the statement of Samajwadi Party MLA Nahid Hasan as serious
 mantri mohsin raja ke alaava anya bijepi mantriyon or netaaon ne bhi nahid hasan ke bayaan kii ninda kii
 Union Minister Pratap Sarangi has said that who will accept the statement of SP MLA? Hindus also buy goods for Muslims and Muslims also buy goods for Hindus
 yah kahkar vah galat tareeke kii sthiti paidaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Today, the culture of India is spreading worldwide
 unhone kaha ki yah samaaj main ashishnutaa paidaa karne kii koshish kar rahe he
 This is not a good thing
 bijepi netaa jiviel narsimha ne vidhayak nahid hasan ke bayaan ko nindaneey bataaya
 He said that dividing the society in this way and looking at the religion of the buyer in purchasing the goods, it is being tried to divide the society
 samaaj main jehar ugalane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Everyone should avoid such efforts
 jiviel narsimha ne kaha ki sapa vidhayak nahid hasan samaaj ko jodne ke bajaay dharm ke naam par baantne kii karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This is very negative thinking
 isaki ghor ninda honi chahie
 No one will benefit from this
 isse samaaj kaa nuksaan hoga
 At the same time, Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti said in conversation with Aaj Tak on the statement of the Kairana MLA that the businessman has no caste or religion
 vidhayak nahid hasan kaa bayaan samaaj ko baantne kii koshish he
 Significantly, a video of Kairana MLA Nahid Hasan has gone viral, in which he is appealing to the people of Muslim community in his constituency not to take the goods from the pro-bjp shopkeepers
 vidhayak kehete hai ki ham saamaan kharidte hai to in bhaajapaayiyon kii dukaan chalati hai or unka ghar chalata he isliye sabhi bhaaiyon se meri apil he ki bijepi samarthit dukaanon se saamaan lenaa band karen
 Are you also among those who use aluminum foil to keep bread or paratha warm? Use of aluminum foil has increased considerably in the last few years
 roti yaa parathe ko isamen lapetate samay hamen yahi lagata he ki isamen rakhi chijen sef or fresh bani rahengi lekin kya sachai bhi yahi he
 
 
 You may not be aware, but food stored in aluminum foil can be dangerous for health
 jab ham kisi garm cheez ko isamen lapetate hai to aluminium garm ho jaataa he or isamen pratikriya shuru ho jaati he
 Due to which some parts of aluminum are also found in the food
 haalanki ham sabhi ke ghar main kisi na kisi rup main to aluminium kaa istemaal hota hi he lekin aluminium kaa bahut adhik istemaal haddiyon ko kamjor bana saktaa he
 In such a situation, keep these things in mind when using aluminum foil: 1
 foile paper main bahut garm khaanaa rap nahin karen
 In such a situation, aluminum will be melted and mixed with food
 jisase alzimer or dementia hone kaa khatra bhi bad saktaa he
 In addition, it is also important that you use good quality foil paper
 2
 Avoid placing acetic items in foil paper
 isse chijen jaldi kharaab ho sakati hai yaa phiraunaka chemical balance bhi bighad saktaa he
 The encounter on 1 April 2018 in Shopian and Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir is the biggest encounter in the last ten years as the largest group of Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkaris were hiding at that place
 uski gheraabandi raat ko hi sena or surakshabalon ne kii thi
 The house where the entire group was demolished was demolished
 abhi maare gaye aatankwaadiyon kii pahchaan honi baaki he, lekin police kaa kahana he ki maare gaye aatankwaadiyon main kuch pramukh commander bhi hai
 Revenge of Lieutenant Omar Fayaz's murder: The Encounter Encounter is considered to be the biggest encounter and the biggest success in the last ten years because it also showed the terrorists who were involved in the murder of Lieutenant Omar Fayaz, the hero martyr of the country and Kashmir
 11 maheene baad desh ne apane bete umr fayaaj kii hatya kaa badla le liya
 The separatists announced the bandh Our soldiers are fighting an unannounced war on terror sponsored by Pakistan and Pakistan's agents in Kashmir
 ye ladaai aasaan nahin he kyonki aatankwaadiyon ko sena or surakshabal chun-chun kar maarthe hai, to unhen bachaane ke liye patharbaajon ke gang aa jate hai
 This happened in Shopian, where an attempt was made to stop the encounter with massive stone pelting
 jab surakshabalon ne sakhti dikhaai, to pakistan kaa agent bana hurriyat gang active ho gaya
 Kashmir has a two-day shutdown
 kal skool-college bhi band hai
 Dealing with the stonemasons with the terrorists When the army surrounded the terrorists in Kachidora of Hashopian, the stoners started gathering
 police or siarpief ne warning di, lekin patharbaj nahin maane
 The army was determined not to give the terrorists a chance to escape under any circumstances
 halaat jab control se baahar hone lage, to police or siarpief ne ection liya
 Police and CRPF personnel were also injured in the stone pelting
 javaabi karrwai main 4 patharbaj maare gaye or kareeb 25 ghayal ho gaye
 When people arrived to help the terrorists, IG CRPF Zulfiqar Hassan said that such a design was made in Shopian, which reached a large number of those who helped the terrorists
 sena kaa oparation chal rahaa tha
 Under the influence of anti-national elements, many people went to the place of encounter and started trying to stop the encounter
 sena ne sanyam ke saath kaam kiya or bheed ko roka
 When the situation got out of control, the soldiers did not hesitate to take strict action
 kitna mushkil he sena kaa kambar-baar surakshabal logon ko chetavanee rahe ki ve encounter kii jagahon par ikattha naa hon, lekin patharbaajon kaa gang har baar active ho jaataa he
 What is the limit of restraint of army and security forces, when terrorists are firing from the front and stones are being thrown to protect them on the other side
 nagarikon kii suraksha sena kii praathamikatasena kii 15veen kor commander eke bhatta kaa kahana he ki hamaari koshish to hoti he ki ek bhi naagarik ko kharonch naa aae
 We try our best to keep them away from the operation
 jo kuch bhi hua, wo lau and order banaae rakhane ke liye hawaii fire yaa kisi cross fire main goli lagi hogi
 There is a lot of discourse about Kashmir to keep restraint on the army and security forces
 sanyam rakhana sahi bhi he, lekin un halaaton main koi kya karegaa jab aatankwaadiyon ko bachaaya jayega or javaanon kii jaan par khatra ban jayega
 What is restraint, the security forces showed this today in Anantnag
 aatankiyon ko samajhane kii koshish huijammu or kashmir ke dijipi espi vaidya ke mutabik unhone aatankwaadiyon ke parivaaravaalon ko bulaayaa
 The conversation was held for about half an hour
 ye kahalwaya ki hinsa kaa rasta chhodkar ve waapas laute
 Unfortunately he did not listen to the family
 espi ne bhi baat kii, lekin aatanki ne nahin suna
 There was no choice in front of the security forces
 duusare aatankwaadi ko jinda pakadaa gaya he
 Vaidya said, 'I don't think it happens anywhere in the world that police, army and CRPF conduct operations keeping this human aspect in mind
 'taaki naa mili aatankiyon ko panahasena pramukh general bipin ravat nebataya ki sena kaa makasad ye tay karnaa he ki aatankiyon ko shahar or gaanv kisi bhi ilaake main shah naa mil sake
 The army has already made it clear that terrorists will not survive at any cost
 bhale hi wo kahin par panaah lekar chupe rahen
 Terrorists will be killed selectively
 bhale hi wo kitne hi patharbaajon ke gang ko ikattha karte rahen
 Army's 15th Corps Commander AK Bhatt says that April 1 was a very special day for all the security forces engaged in operations against terrorism
 is din do oparation, puure kar kiye gaye
 Three terrorists were killed in three operations
 duusare oparation main 7 aatankwaadi maar giraae hai, unamem 2 aatankwaadi may main leftinent umr fayaaj kii hatya main bhi shaamil the

 ghar sirf chat or chaar deevaaren nahin hota
 Some houses are full of history, heritage and memories that make them unique
 isliye kabhi-kabhi inamen se koi ek ghar hamaare liye bahut khaas ho jaataa he, kyonki bhale hi hakeekat main ham in gharon main na rahe hon, lekin hamaare kaalpanik paatr unamem rahe hote hai
 For example the lakeside cabin of the science and fiction film Avengers: Endgame, in which the film's Iron Man (tony Stark) lives with his wife Pepper and daughter Morgan
 potterheads ek aisa hi ghar he
 Hardly anyone is familiar with the house of this name, but it is the same house in which Lily and James Potter lived in the fictional town of Godric and 'you Know Who' gave Harry the mark of his lightning bolt

 Former England all-rounder player Andrew Flintoff says Jofra Archer should be included in the 15-man England squad for the World Cup at any cost
 archer ko world cap ke liye chuni gai praarambhik team kaa hissaa nahin banaaya gaya
 He recently took three wickets for his country in two matches and bowled at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour
 'bibisi' ne flintoff ke hawaale se bataaya, 'archer ko team main hona chahie
 Whom will i exclude for them? To anyone, he is a great player
 ' archer ne pakistan ke khilaaf england ke liye apana pehla tii-20 match khelaa or 29 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Flintoff said, 'he is incredible

 Flintoff said, "not all of them were in favor of this decision as Thropp made a comeback and scored a century against South Africa, but Peterson showed how he (australia) could be faced
" archer ke paas bhi logon ko usee tarah se aashcharyachakit karne kii kshamta he, vah lagaataar behtareen pradarshan karte hai
 'he said,' Team spirit is born by winning, i have played for many teams and team spirit was found only where the team was successful
 kisi ko kisi ko team main shaamil karnaa koi bada mudda nahin he
 England will play their first match against South Africa on 30 May in the upcoming World Cup
 congress or samaajawaadee party main antat gathbandhan ho gaya
 But even after the alliance, the Congress days will be very different, at least it does not look like seeing their own stronghold
 raibareli or amethi main aaj kii jo sthiti he usamen congress party apana purana flop sho hi is vidhansabha main doharaati nazar aa rahi he
 It is not that the position of the Congress on both these parliamentary seats was as weak as the previous assembly elections
 lekin samaajawaadee party ne yahaan kii siton par apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa karke congress kaa sara khel bigaad diya he
 Read here - Who will benefit and who will lose in the UP elections from the alliance? In the seats where the Congress was able to do better and from where the caste and social arithmetic seemed to be favorable for it, on those seats the Samajwadi Party gave the Congress Has been optioned
 congress ke hisse main ab in donon sansadeey siton kii ve vidhansabha siten hi bachi hai jahaan se congress ke paas majboot or jitau chehre tak nahin hai
 In the last assembly elections in Mathemarai Bareilly, the Congress account was also not open
 amethi main do siton par party jiti thi- tiloi or jagadishpur vidhansabha seat
 The Muslim candidate, who won from Tiloi, joined the Muslim BSP and this time his son Saud is in the fray
 congress ke paas ek seat par hi jeet kii guarantee he or wo seat he raibareli kii sadar seat
 Here Akhilesh Pratap Singh has been winning continuously on the basis of his status and mass base
 isbaar unki beti aditi singh maidan main hai
 They have been included in the Congress and thus there is a possibility of the Congress becoming elusive
 lekin is bohani ke baad congress jin siton par jeet sakati thi unpar hi sapa ne apane pratyaashee de die hai
 The Congress was in a position to put up a strong claim on seats like Unchahar, Salon, Gauriganj, Sareni
 in siton par ab sapa ke pratyaashee maidan main hai
 The Congress has seats like Harchandpur and Bachhrawan from where the SP, despite being a strong candidate, has been left for the Congress
 isse sapa kaa bhi ganit gadabad hota nazar aa rahaa he
 The saddest part is that the air against the mlas whom the SP has announced to repeat remains strong and it is difficult to win them
 is sthiti main congress ke liye un siton ko chhodana is gathbandhan ke liye phaayde kii baat hoti lekin bina taiyaari kaa gathbandhan apane hi pair par kulhadi maar chukaa he
 The third seems to be benefiting that due to lack of mutual cohesion between these two parties, the BJP and BSP are now likely to benefit
 darasal, is siton par sapa se khafa logon ke paas congress ek behatar vikalp hoti lekin us sambhaavna ke kamazor hone se voter basapa or bhaajapa kii ore ummid se dekh rahe hai
 Garima Singh, the first wife of Congress leader Sanjay Singh from Amethi, has been given a ticket by the BJP and it is believed that she can give a good fight to Gayatri Prajapati
 vahi sthiti unchaahar ke liye he jahaan swami prasad maury ke bete or sapa ke vartmaan vidhayak se naaraaz voter ab basapa kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 The BSP has given ticket to Vivek Singh, son of former MLA Gajadhar Singh, on this seat
 gajadhar singh sapa se kai baar chunaav lard chuke hai or is vajah se is seat par rajput or muslim vot main unki paith he
 His son can take advantage of this
 yah bhram ab or bhi gaharaa ho gaya he kyonki priyanka gandhi ke karyaalay se in sabhi siton par congress ke sambhavit pratyaashiyon ko bhi taiyaar rahane ke liye kaha gaya he
 In such a situation, voters are confused about who is the candidate of the alliance in these seats
 donon hi party ke pratyaashee taiyaari bhi kar rahe hai or sakate main bhi hai
 Actually, Rae Bareli and Amethi are just examples of confusion
 agar garh main hi sthiti aisi he to sochie ki baaki soobe main gathbandhan zamin par kitna kargar hoga
 If the situation remains the same, then this alliance will be able to convert into votes on the ground, it seems suspicious
 samaajawaadee party or congress ke gathbandhan kii sabase badi do chunautiyaan hai
 The first is that the cohesion in the distribution of tickets corresponds to the majority of the coalition
 or doosraa he donon partiyon ke vot ekadusre ke liye dalava paanaa

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi while replying to the motion of no confidence in Parliament said that the story of NPA in the country started in 2008 during the tenure of Congress and continued till 2014
 pradhanmantri modi ne purv kii congress sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki usne apane kaarykaal ke dauraan sarkari bainkon se party ke karibiyon ko badi sankhya main lone dene kaa kaam shuru kiya jiske chalate desh ke saamne enpie kii ek badi chunauti khadi ho gai
 Prime Minister Modi said that it was the effort of the Congress government to vacate the banks of the country as much as possible if they lose the elections in 2009
 lekin bainkon kaa durbhaagya tha ki 2009 main ek baar phir congress kii sarkaar bani or bainkon kii lut upie ke duusare kaarykaal ke dauraan bina ruke jari rahi
 The Prime Minister said that till 60 years after independence, the banks of the country had given only 18 lakh crore rupees in the form of loans
 lekin 2008 se 2014 tak main yah raashi 18 lakh karod se badhkar 52 lakh karod rupee par pahunch gai
 According to Modi, during this 6 years of the Congress, the debt of 60 years was doubled
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki khasbaat yah he ki is samay tak desh main internet banking ne kadam nahin rakhaa tha
 But the Congress government resorted to telephone banking before the rise of internet banking to carry out this scam
 modi ne aarope lagaaya ki congress ke netaaon kaa bank ke manageron ko sidhe phone kiya jaataa tha or party ke kareebi kaarobaariyon ko sifarish ke saath bad lone de diya jaataa tha
 Highlighting this aspect of the NPA, the PM said that during this time when the time came to repay the loans of the businessmen, instead of recovering loans from them, new loans were given to them and due to this, the burden of debt continued to rise continuously on the public sector banks
 
 modi ne daawa kiya ki congress kii is karstani ke chalate 2014 main endie sarkaar ko enpie kii samasya ek landmine kii tarah mili
 Modi said that another reason for increasing npas is that such decisions were taken during the tenure of the UPA government, so that the problem of NPA is hidden from the balance sheet of banks and no one can know about this landmine
 piem ne daawa kiya ki endie sarkaar ke unke karyakal ke dauraan eemaandaaree ke saath bank ke enpie kii vaastavik sthiti dikhaane kii parampara ko shuru kiya
 Subsequently, a reform program was launched to reform the banks afresh
 vahiin pradhanmantri ne daawa kiya ki desh main yadi 12 bade difolter kii baat karen to 45 fisadi recovery kii ja chuki he
 With the reforms during the tenure of the NDA government, there is now hope that the country's banks will get back on track soon

 Team Bharat wishes @priyankachopra loads of love & happiness for life In the ruling Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh, Yadav, who was trying to reconcile the father son, got stuck in the last moment as he passed the formula
 formule kii tamaam chizon par sahmati ban gai, lekin aakhir main aakar baat atak gai
 This was Azam Khan's formula: 1
 mulaayam singh yadav rashtriya adhyaksh bane rahen,akhilesh yadavais pad se apana daawa waapas le len
 2
 akhilesh ko pradesh adhyaksh kii kaman waapas de di jaae or tikat bantwaare main unki ahm bhoomika rahe
 3
 shivpal yadav ko dilli main rashtriya mahasachiv bana diya jaakar unhen rashtriya raajnneeti main bhej diya jaae
 4
 mulaayam dhade ke amar singh or akhilesh samarthak ramgopal yadav ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya jaae
 As far as the consensus: Mulayam suddenly came to Delhi with Shivpal on Thursday morning
 thodi der baad mulaayam ke ghar amar singh bhi pahunch gaye, jahaan teenon ke bich lambii charchaa hui or kanoonee pahalu bhi talaashe gaye
 According to the sources, with this, everything within the party should be well protected, for this, Amar Singh himself said to Mulayam Singh Yadav that if all is well with the party, then he himself is ready for it, Netaji should decide
 vahiin shivpal yadav ne rashtriya mahasachiv banakar pradesh kii raajnneeti se dur rahane ke prastaav par ek kadam aage badhate hue kah diya ki akhilesh apane hisaab se chunaav lard len, vah is dauraan party main niskriy rahane ko taiyaar hai
 Shivpal said that he is ready for what Netaji would say
 to aakhir kahaan fansaa pench:sutara bataate hai ki isse pehle lakhanu main bhi in sab baton par charchaa ho chuki thi, lekin tab bhi is sabake badale main akhilesh apane kareebi chachaa ramgopal ke par katarne se pehle tikat bantwaare main puraa control maangane lage
 According to sources, all the people of the Mulayam faction were ready for that too, but when it came to returning Netaji to the post of President with respect, then on behalf of Akhilesh it was said that Netaji had made him the CM and now he won the election
 Both the chair of the national president and the post of chief minister will be handed back to him
 sutron ke mutabik akhilesh ne kaha, 'netaji kaa puraa sammaan he or rahegaa or har jagah postaron main unka cheharaa hoga, lekin chunaav mujhe apane hisaab se ladane diya jaae
 Akhilesh returned by saying just that
 darasal, akhilesh ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki pita mulaayam singh ko adhyaksh pad dene main akhilesh ko koi aitraaj nahin, lekin tikat baantne ke baad unke ird-gird maujuud shaktiyon ke dabaav main netaji ne apni kalam se nae qadam uthaa liye, tab akhilesh ke paas sirf haath malane ke kuch nahin bachegaa
 In such a situation, Akhilesh is reliably preparing in a legal manner
 sapa kaa chunaav chihn 'cycle' jabt hone kii surat main kya karnaa he, uski taiyaari kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Akhilesh is also engaged in the efforts of Mahagathjod, while the Mulayam Khema is resorting to legal betting by understanding the weakness in the performance of power
 is bich party ke varisht netaa abhi bhi koshish main hai ki shaayad koi karishma ho jaae or pita putr ek ho jaaen
 On Monday, PM Modi was addressing an election rally in Mau, Uttar Pradesh
 piem raily kii spich main lagaataar gathbandhan shabd kaa zikr aane ke baad upi ke siyaasi galiyaaron main is baat kii charchaa tej ho gai ki kya upi chunaav trishanku vidhansabha kii ore bad rahaa he or aise main logon ko man main sawaal uthne lage ki agar vidhansabha trishanku hoti he to upi ke saamne kya honge vikalp?vikalp-1: bijepi ko bispi kaa samarthanchunaav ke baad trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main bijepi or bispi ke bich gathbandhan kii sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 If BJP becomes a big party, then BSP can support it
 pehle bhi donon dal milakar sarkaar bana chuke hai
 However, at the election rallies, there is a lot of talk in the statements between the leaders of both parties, but nothing is impossible in politics
 sapa-congress ko rokane ke liye donon dal phir ek saath aa sakate hai
 Mayawati may also try to reinvigorate her political ground by joining up with the central government and joining the power of UP
 loksabhaa chunaavon main bispi kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa tha or sabakuch ab vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon par nirbhar karegaa
 Option-2: bjp's support to the BSP If the BSP emerges as the largest party, then the BJP can also support it
 isse ek taraf to vah upi kii satta main shaamil ho sakati he yaa baahar se samarthan dekar apane prabhaav se upi main siyaasi jameen majboot kar sakati he or saath hi congress or sapa ko satta se dur rakhkar unhen phir se ubharne kaa mauka nahin dekar apana prabhaav badhaane kii koshish karegi
 Option-3: If the BJP does not get a majority in UP if the BSP does not get the majority support from the sp-congress, then the opposition parties may come together to prevent it from coming to power
 bijepi ko rokane ke liye sapa-congress bispi ko baahar se yaa sarkaar main shaamil hokar samarthan de sakate hai
 Everything is possible in politics
 upi se sabhi dal is baat par ekajute ho sakate hai ki bijepi ko upi main siyaasi jameen taiyaar karne kaa mauka nahin mil sake
 Option-4: BSP Supports sp-congress If sp-congress alliance has more seats, BSP can support it from outside
 bijepi ko satta se rokane ke liye ye sabhi dal ek saath aa sakate hai
 The BSP may not be involved in the government but it will see many advantages in keeping the BJP away from power in UP
 ek to ye ki satta main apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar vah 2019 kii chunaav kii taiyaariyon main lag sakati he or pichhali baar ke safaye se ubarne kii koshish karegi
 This will be possible only when bjp's influence in UP is less and BSP knows that this is possible only when BJP is kept away from Lucknow
 vikalp-5: sapa-congress ko chote dalon kaa sathupi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye jis tarah dhur virdohi maane jane vaali samaajawaadee party or congress ne haath mila liya usee tarah chunaav ke baad nae sameekaran saamne aa sakate hai
 If the sp-congress stays close to the majority, a coalition government can be formed with many smaller parties
 kai aise dal hai jinka apane-apane ilaakon main prabhaav hai or ve nai sthiti main apni ranneeti phir se taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Such as RLD, Apna Dal (krishna Patel faction), Peace Party, Owaisi's party AIMIM etc
 haalanki, abhi chunaav jari he or do charnon ke chunaav hone hai
 And only after the results come, the situation will be clear as to which side the camel of UP power sits

 Just as cyclonic storms have names, now droughts should also be named
 main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke naam par ‘nitish sookhaa' rakhana chahta hum
 The 'nitish drought' is the drought that has come or is coming from the state government's policy of installing thousands of submersible pumps
 aap jaanate hai ki 2016 ke chunaav ke samay nitish kumaar ne saat nishchay kiye the
 One of the determinations is that all households will be provided with tap water
 is yojana par rajya sarkaar thik-thik tezi se kaam kar rahi he
 It may be that by 31 March 2020, it can provide tap water to millions of homes
 logon ke ghar main pipe se pani jane lage
 Before the 'nitish drought' comes into Bihar and the underground water level goes down rapidly, we must assess the dangers of submersible pumps being installed in different places
 bihar sarkaar ne apni tarah se thik sochaa hoga ki logon ko ghar main pani milanaa chahie
 She will also have the same solution among the solutions available to her, so that she would be seen to be rapidly delivering tap water
 isliye mukhyamantri ne ise saat nishchay main shaamil kiya
 Sadly, where the campaign to save water was involved in his determination, it turned upside down
 bhumigat jal ke saarvajanik yaa sarkari dohan kii is yojana ko agar koi nishchay main shaamil kare to yaad rakhie ab pani ko lekar kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 It is not only paving the way for plunder of water but is also creating new partners of plunder of public money
 bihar ke akhabaaron main sabmarsible pump se sambandhit khabaron ko khangaaliye
 Without thinking, journalists are presenting the plan to install this pump as a good news
 bich bich main pump lagane ko lekar kai tarah ke ghotaale kii khabaren bhi kone-kinare main chhapi mili hai
 Patna has news that Patna Municipal Corporation is installing 375 submersible pumps in all 75 wards of the city
 ek ward main paanch sabmarsible pump kaa ausat banataa he
 Nearly 150 submersible pumps are being installed in Darbhanga
 rajya ke sabhi vaardon or panchayaton ke liye yah yojana he
 If the public sees the government installing submersible pumps like the campaign, then it will also encourage itself to install such pumps
 yahi ho bhi rahaa he
 In a city like Darbhanga where the number of ponds was hundreds, there is no water in them today
 is zile se guzarane vaali 90 se adhik nadiyon kii dharaaen suukh chuki hai
 Many rivers have disappeared
 shahar kaa bhumigat jalastr neeche chalaa gaya to vahaan lagaae gaye saikadon kii sankhya main handpump suukh gaye
 The hand pump also takes water from the ground
 uski jagah par laayaa gaya sabmarsible pump jo zyada gahare jaakar pani laa saktaa he
 An average of 16-18 submersible pumps are being installed in this city every day
 pichley teen maheenon main 1500-1600 sabmarsible pump to khud logon ne lagaae hai
 On which you have spent 80 thousand to one lakh rupees from your pocket
 bihar main pani kaa bijness bhi chal niklaa he
 Water is being sold from the tampons to the bisleri bins of the village by filling the tank with a private pump
 aap bihar jaaie, har jagah chote tampon par pani kii ek yaa do tankiyaan rakhi milengi
 At present, there is so much demand for submersible pumps in Bihar that boring machines from Haryana, Rajasthan and UP have brought their machines
 kya 1000 feet par pani anant maatra main uplabdh he? jab pani 40 feet se 200 feet par ja saktaa he to ek din 1000 feet or usase bhi neeche chalaa jayega tab aap kya karenge? bihar main talabon kaa bade paimaane par atikaraman hua
 The ponds that are there have not been cleaned
 jab tak aap pani ke paaramparik sansadhano ko nahin bachaayenge, sabmarsible pump se pani dene kii yojana se aap sookhaa aane kii raftaar ko teen guna tej kar denge
 Wherever such pumps are installed, underground water level has gone down in two years
 agar ham pani bachaayenge nahin, to zamin se khinchakar pani pahunchane kii yah yojana sirf aaj or kal kaa samaadhaan sabit hogi
 The day after or the next day, drought will come
 bihar ke kai zilon main sabmarsible pump ke kaaran bhumigat jalastr neeche jane hi laga hoga
 During the Lok Sabha elections, people of one such village had collided
 logon ne pani kii maang ko lekar sadak jam kar diya tha
 All the wells in his village had dried up
 handpump kaa pani achaanak neeche chalaa gaya or bekaar ho gaya tha
 There was no water for ten days
 magar usee gaanv ke thik sadak us paar do gaanvon main pani aa rahaa tha
 Because there was more water being drawn from the submersible pump
 zaahir he iskaa asar pradarshan kar rahe gaanv par padaa hi hoga
 This has happened in many parts of the country
 tubewel or sabmarsible pump kuch samay ke baad suukh hi jate hai
 i wish Nitish Kumar would have decided to save water resources
 puri sarkaar talabon ko bachaane main lag jaati to log uski kamyaabi ko dekhte hue apane str se bhi talabon ko bachaane kaa prayaas karte
 Till the campaign will not be about rainwater harvesting, there will be no revival of millions of ponds, till then we will keep pretending to provide water
 hazaron lakhon kii sankhya main sabmarsible pump lagane kii yojana ko protsaahit kar ham bihar main har jagah sookhe kii sthiti paidaa kar rahe hai
 If submersible had been the solution, Chennai would not have a water crisis today
 isliye kah rahaa hum ki bhale hi logon ko kuch samay ke liye pani miltaa dikh rahaa hoga, nitish kaa pani pahunch rahaa hoga, jaldi hi unke gharon main ‘nitish sookhaa' bhi pahunchane vaala he
 China's state media said it could not even afford to lose an inch of its land and ruled out the withdrawal of the People's Liberation Army (chinese Army) troops from the Doklam area of sikkim sector to end the military clash

 gauratlab he ki videshmantri ne sansad main kaha tha ki bhartiya sainikon ne chini kshetra main ghuspaith nahin kii, balki sabhi desh bharat ke rukh kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry has not responded to Sushma's remarks
 haalanki akhbaar ne kaha, yah sidhi baat he ki bharat ne china kii jameen par ghuspaith kii he or bharat kii sainya takat china se kaaphi kam he
 According to the editorial, if the conflict between China and India escalates to such a level that if the dispute is resolved by military means, India will surely lose
 chini akhbaar ne kaha ki china baatcheet kii purv shart ke taur par apni sena waapas bulaane par kabhi bhi sahamat nahin hoga or agar bharat jid par ada rahaa to use bhavishya main tanaav ke gambhir rup se badhane par sabhi sambhaavnaaon ko lekar taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 In the Preity and Ness Wadia dispute, what was waiting for everyone, the wait was over
 mangalvaar ko 30 may ke sach kii tahaqiqaat karne ke liye police ne priti zinta ko mumbai ke vankhede stadium main unka bayaan darj karaane ke liye bulaayaa
 Because on Sunday morning at 11:30 in the morning, when Preity Zinta returned to Mumbai, the market of speculation was hot when the police would record Preity's statement
 priti ne police se unka bayaan unke ghar main lene kii guzarish kii thi lekin police ne unki is maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 According to the Mumbai Police, she wanted to take Preeti's statement at the Wankhede Stadium so that the full truth of the controversy could be revealed
 mangalvaar shaam 6 bajkar 40 minute par priti jinta apana bayaan darj karaane ke liye vankhede stadium pahunchi
 Since the case is high profile, Mumbai made special security arrangements
 priti ke stadium pahunchate hi police ne kareeb 7 baje unase maamle kii poochtacha shuru kii
 First the police took him to the BCCI office inside the stadium and kept answering questions for an hour there
 sutron ke mutabik priti ne police ko bataaya ki 30 may ko match ke dauraan nais ne kaise unke saath jhagada shuru kiya
 According to Preity's statement, he had 35 AC seats and fifty general seats to watch the match on 30 May
 or jab deree se pahunchane par ness ko seat ke liye intazaar karnaa padaa to kaise unhone sabake saamne priti se badasluki kii
 He was abused and twisted his hand
 iske alaava priti ne police ko 12 se 14 logon ke naam bhi bataaen
 Who are the witnesses of this whole incident
 kareeb ek ghante kii poochtacha ke baad sava aath baje police ne puri ghatana kaa rikshtraction kiya
 During this, for the next twenty minutes she took Preeti to the places where according to her Preity had an argument with Ness Wadia and Ness Wadia misbehaved with them
 priti ne police ko un teenon jagahon kii pahchaan karai jahaan ness ke saath unki bahes hui
 According to Preity, he had a quarrel with Ness Wadia at three places
 pehla jhagada pavilion ke baahar, doosraa jhagada garwaare and par or teesraa jhagada match khatm hone ke baad maidan par hua
 Preity also told the police that after the battle of Garvare pavilion she sat on the non-ac seat next to her friend Danish merchant
 sutron ke mutabik priti jinta ne police poochtacha main jin chashmadidon ke naam liye hai unamem mukhya chashmadid ek videshi mul ke naagarik mistar jin he jo bakaul priti unke achche dost bhi hai
 During interrogation, Preeti reveals that her guest Jean tried to rescue her and Ness in a fight, but Ness Wadia misbehaved with him
 priti zinta se poochtacha ke baad mumbai police ne ab un 14 logon kaa bayaan lene kaa man banaaya he jinke naam apane bayaan main priti ne liye hai
 Apart from this, the police will also see footage of those three places
 jahaan donon main ladaai hui thi
 To investigate the matter, Mumbai Police will also ask for RAW footage captured in 19 cameras from IPL broadcaster Sony Channel
 kyonki police ko ab tak telecast hue vijuals hi mili hai
 Apart from this, the police also questioned Preity about the underworld don Ravi Pujari
 kyonki ravi pujari is maamle main ness wadiya ko dhamkee dene ke liye phone kar chukaa he
 The police asked Preeti if she knew Ravi Pujari
 to jawaab main priti ne kaha ki wo kisi ravi pujari ko nahin jaanati
 Since the case is related to the heirs of a big business house of the country and a famous Bollywood heroine, the police is also investigating this case with great precaution

 It is a reversal derived from GST
 jiesti kii khot, naakaami or kirakiri isaki raajnneeti kii dein hai, iske arthshaastra yaa computer network kii nahin
 If a political party is cut off from the ground during a major reform, it may have to celebrate Diwali twice in three months
 pehle jiesti laane kii diwaali (1 july) or isse chhutkaare kii (6 aktubar)
 GST was a reform of the bjp's basic vote bank, not a handful of big companies
 yah desh ke lakhon chote udyogon or vyapaar ke liye kaarobaar ke taur-tareeke badalane kaa sabase bada abhiyaan tha
 All the economic reforms that India has undertaken since 1991 were for the organized sector ie big companies
 jidipi main kareeb 50 fisadi or rojgaron ke srijan main 90 fisadi hissaa rakhane vaale asangathit kshetra ko sudhaaron kii sugandh milane kaa sanyog nahin ban sakaa
 GST was also for the bjp's vote bank as a tax reform
 badi companiyaan to pehle se hi tex de rahi hai or aam taur par niyamon kii paband hai
 The unorganized sector is notorious for non-payment of tax in concessions
 use niyamon kaa paband banaaya janaa he
 Not surprisingly, small businessmen were also the most excited about GST as it was promising to fulfill their three wishes: 1
 tex daron main kami yani behatar margin or zyada bikri2
 Easy rule means reduction in cost of complying with tax law ie clean business opportunity3
 digital sanchaalan yani afasaron kii ugaahi or bhrashtachar se nijaatanthe aarthik sensos (2016) ne bataaya he ki bharat main kheti ke alaava, kareeb 78
 2 per cent of the enterprises run solely on the operators' own investment (self-financed)
 unki kaarobaari jindagi main bank yaa sarkari karj kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 The above three promises of GST were very valuable for the profits of small traders
 jameen yaa kiraaye, eendhan or bijli kii badhati laagat par unka vash nahin he, jiesti ke sahare vah kaarobaar main chamak kii ummid se labalab the
 At the beginning of 2015, when the government started the exercise of political consensus on GST, the enthusiasm of small businessmen started jumping
 yahi vah vakt tha jab unke saath sarkaar kaa samvaad shuru hona chahie tha taaki unki apekshaayen or mushkilen samajhi ja saken
 The government swinging in Gurur did not understand its need then
 kaarobaariyon ko us vakt tak, jiesti kii chidipha kaa naak-naksh bhi pataa nahin tha lekin unhen yah ummid thi ki unki apni bhaajapa, jo vishaal chote kaarobaar kii chunautiyon ko sabase behatar samajhati he, unke sapanom kaa jiesti le hi aegi
 In mid-2016, the government released the model GST law for discussion
 yah jiesti ke praavdhaanon se unka pehla parichay tha
 This was the occasion where GST started scaring the businessmen
 teen stareey jiesti, har rajya main panjikaran or har maheene teen ritern se ladaa-fada yah kanoon bhaajapa ke vot bank kii ummiido ke thik vipareet tha
 However, by the time the small mediums of the business world could understand the intricacies of GST, demonetisation broke on their business
 uttar pradesh kii jeet, bhaajapa ke dambh yaa gafalat kaa charam thi
 BJP was fully aware of the fears and concerns about GST
 lekin tab tak party or sarkaar ne yah maan liya tha ki chote kaarobaari adatan tex chori karte hai
 GST is necessary to improve them
 isliye jiesti council ne tabadatod baithkon main chaar daron vaale asangat tex dhaanche ko tay kiya, unke tahat utpaada or sevaayen feet kin or lunjpunj computer network ke saath 1 july ko jiesti kii pehali diwaali manaa lee gai
 After the arrival of GST, the government had launched an army of its ministers to promote it but they had to return to camps soon
 antat apane hi janaadhar ke jabardast virodh se dari bhaajapa ne gujarat chunaav se pehle jiesti ko sir ke bal khadaa kar diya
 This tax reform is handed back to the artisans who are cooling the anger of the bjp's vote bank by beating it
 growth, aasaan kaarobaar yaa behatar rajasav, jiesti philhal apni kisi bhi ummid par khara nahin utraa kyonki ise laane vaale lokapriyata ke shikhar par chadhate hue rajnatik jadon se gaffil ho gaye the
 The victory and defeat in the elections will continue, but a very sensitive reform, now can hardly recover

 Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the BJP is in power both at the Center and the state and should take responsibility for excessive use of force during the demonstrations in Kashmir after the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, under the Prime Minister Kisan Yojana, the Modi government of the Center will speed up the election campaign by giving the first installment of Rs 2000 in the farmers' account
 magar pradhanmantri kisaan yojana ke silsile main modi sarkaar kii raah main kai chunautiyaan hai, jo munh baae khadi hai
 In fact, Prime Minister Kisan Yojna (PM Kisan Yojna) will be started today i
e
 on Sunday, February 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Gorakhpur
 is yojana ke tahat do hectare se kam bhoomi vaale kisaanon ko pehali kisht ke do hajaar rupee die jaaenge
 6 thousand rupees will be given to the farmers through three installments in a year
 ye raashi bainkon se sidhe unke khaaton main pahunchaai jaaegi
 But to fully implement this plan of Modi government on the ground, many challenges have to be overcome
 darasal, farvari main bajet satr ke dauraan sarkaar ne 12 karod garib kisaanon ko saal main 6000 rupee dene kaa elaan kiya tha, jiskaa prastaavit kharch 75 hajaar karod he
 But about 1 as the first installment during a mega event in Uttar Pradesh by Prime Minister Modi on Sunday
 7 karod kisaanon ko pradhanmantri kisaan yojana ke tahat raashi vitarit kii jaaegi
 In such a situation, the question arises when in the first installment only 1
 7 karod kisaanon ko hi iskaa phayda milegaa, to sarkaar 12 karod kisaanon ke lakshya ko kaise puraa karegi, kyonki march ke pehle saptaah main aachaar samhita ke lagu hone kii bhi ummid he
 The documents obtained by NDTV and the official data on its review show that the rate of rejections is much higher than the proportion of beneficiaries who have received submissions
 yani kisaanon kii sabamishan entry main kaaphi rijection dekhne ko mili hai or yah rijection data kii quality par bhi sawaal uthaate hai
 So far the State Governments have 3 in Public Financial Management System (PFMS) of the Government
 2 karod pravishtiyaan jamaa kii hai
 Of these, 5
5 million entries are pending
 ab bache 2
 5 crores, 1 of which
 7 karod pravishtiyon ko paas kar diya gaya he or 84 lakh ko riject kiya gaya he
 In this way, the rejection rate is 33 percent
 yani kul milakar dekha jaae to pehali kisht main pradhanmantri kisaan yojana kaa phayda 1
 7 crore farmers will be received and 33% of the entries of farmers have been rejected
 enditivi ko jo aankade mili hai, us par gaur kiya jaae to aisa lagata he ki bijepi shasit rajyon kii pravishtiyaan zyada ai hai
 There can be politics about this and there can be a period of accusation
 labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan karne kii prakriya ko lekar bhi raajnneeti ho sakati he
 NDTV found that bjp-ruled states sent a significant number of submissions, compared to just 2 per cent of submissions sent by Congress-ruled states when it came to beneficiaries joining the first installment
 yani labhaarthiyon kii pravishtiyon main bijepi shasit rajyon ke 67 fisadi labhaarthi hai, vahiin congress shasit rajyon ke mahaj 2 fisadi
 The scheme will be implemented from today and UP has 30 percent share in the submissions so far
 jabaki rajasthan, madhya pradesh or karnataka jaise rajyon ne kul sabamishan kaa kramshah 0
 03 percent, 0
 01 pratishat or 0
 6 percent share
 vahiin, ek anya gaiyr bijepi shasit rajya pashchim bengal ne is vakt kii pravishtiyon ke liye kisi bhi labhaarthi kii pahchaan nahin kii he
 The government had proposed to transfer the first installment of rupees to all the 12 crore farmers by March 31, under which 2 thousand rupees would be transferred in the first installment
 magar march ke pehle saptaah main aachaar samhita lagu hone kii ummid he
 In such a situation, the Election Commission's run may run on this plan of the government and the government of 12 crores may fail to touch the government
 kyonki aachaar samhita aam taur par keval pehle se chal rahi yojanaon ke fund ke hastantaran kii hi anumati detii he or nai yojanaon ke liye kisi tarah ke paise or fund ke transfar kii anumati nahin detii he
 However, during the announcement in the budget in February, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana was introduced as a retrospective scheme starting from December 1, 2018, which is why the Modi government can argue that it is already running There is a plan and it has nothing to do with the election
 kisaanon ko paise transfar karne ke liye sarkaar tark ke rup main iskaa hi hawala de sakati he
 Explain that under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi (pm-kisan) scheme starting from December 1, 2018, the government has decided to transfer direct money to the farmers' account
 NDTV ne teen purv mukhya chunaav ayuktaon (CEC) se baat kii, jinhone sarvasammati se kaha ki bhugtan keval un labhaarthiyon ko kiya ja saktaa he, jinaki pahchaan ab tak kii ja chuki he or jo adarsh aachaar samhita ke lagu hone se pehle pehle namankit hai
 Naveen Chawla, who served as a CEC between April 2009 and July 2010, said that if the beneficiaries are identified before the Model Code of Conduct, they can receive (payment)
 adarsh aachaar samhita ke baad kisi nae labhaarthi kii pahchaan nahin kii ja sakati he
 Another former CEC Naseem Zaidi said that if beneficiaries have not been identified, payments cannot be made without the permission of the Commission
 vahiin, krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ne enditivi se kaha ki agar aisa koi mudda uthta he to sarkaar iskaa samaadhaan nikaalegi
 He said that 'once a scheme starts and it becomes an ongoing scheme, then i do not see any challenge
 lekin agar chunaav ayog jaisi kuch takneekee nirnay lete hai 
 
 
 If you will decide that you cannot do this, cannot add new beneficiaries, then we will deal with it '

 Atishi told over the phone that Marlena is not his surname
 yah diya gaya upnaam he
 Atishi says that her surname is Singh, but she herself decided that she would only use the name Atishi for the election

 According to sources, Atishi has changed his name on social media a few days ago
 udhar, bavaal khadaa hote hi soshal media par aam aadmi party ke samarthak aatishi ke bachaav main utar aae
 Party joint secretary Akshay Marathe tweeted "as a progressive politician, Atishi never used the caste name 'singh' to ask for votes
 magar ab unhen sirf aatishi likhane par nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Our debate has been around education and health service, not caste or religious
 "bataa den ki aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal ne laksminagar main aatishi kaa naam purvi dilli loksabhaa se ummidavaar ke taur par ghoshit kiya he
 During this time, all ministers and leaders along with Kejriwal had arrived to inaugurate the party office of East Delhi Lok Sabha in Laxminagar
 is daphtar main bhi sirf aatishi naam hi likhaa gaya he
 Currently the controversy has arisen after the removal of Marlena from the name
 sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki chunaav se thik pehle aatishi ko apana naam badalane kii zarurat kyon padi? kya jatigat vajahon se aatishi ne apana naam badal liya? haalanki ab tak aam aadmi party kii taraf se aatishi dwaara naam badalane ke maamle main koi aadhikarik bayaan saamne nahin aayaa he
