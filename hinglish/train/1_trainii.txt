 On Thursday, his fellow employees decided to go on strike against the suspension of two Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Service (DANICS) officers working in the Home Department by Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain
 lekin vivaad badhane ke baad centre sarkaar ne unka nilamban roak diya he
 Satyendra Jain said that he had no idea of any kind of strike
 unhone kaha ki nilamban prashasan kaa maamla he or cabinet isamen koi nirnay nahin le saktaa
 He said, 'the officials cannot tell me that the Lieutenant Governor has asked us not to work
 rajyapal ko likhit aadesh dena chahie tha
 'go on leave' Satyendra Jain said, 'why don't the employees go on leave instead of going on a day-long strike? Then we will explain how good government operates
 'kya he maamla?dilli sarkaar ke grih vibhaag main special secretary yashpal garg or subhash chandra naam ke do DANICS adhikariyon ko suspend kiya gaya tha
 The association protested the suspension of both, demanding that it be withdrawn
 DANICS kaa kahana he ki uske adhikari ke nilambankaa adhikaar dilli sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 Letter to MHA against suspension The DANICS Association wrote a letter to the Union Home Ministry against the Delhi government's decision to suspend the two officials
 chitthee main association ne nilamban radd karne kii maang kii
 After this the Central Government withdrew the suspension
 kahaan se shuru hua maamla?sarkari vakil or tihaad jail ke karmchaariyon kaa vetan badhaane kaa maamla he
 The Delhi government sent the file to the lieutenant governor after passing it from the cabinet without obtaining the approval of the central government
 LG ne niyamon kaa hawala dekar bina manjuuri ke ise centre sarkaar ke paas bhej diya
 Satendra Jain asked these officials to issue notifications in this regard, but Jain suspended both of them for ignoring the rules based on it
 kya he niyam?niyamon ke mutabik, sirf raashtrapati ko hi in karmchaariyon kii selary tay karne kaa adhikaar he
 Although notifications in this regard can be issued with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor, the minister pressured the officials to sign the notification without the permission of the Lieutenant Governor
 niyamon kaa hawala dete hue adhikariyon ne hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya kyonki khud uparajyapal ne bhi unhen hidaayat de rakhi he ki unki sahmati ke bina aise kisi bhi kaagaj par hastakshar naa kiye jaaen
 lg's decision to suspend this decision is expected to lead to a resurgence between the government and the Lt
 Governor, as only the Lt
 Governor has the right to suspend the senior officers, who can do so only after getting permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs
 sarkaar ke is faisle se naaraaz danix ke sabhi adhikariyon ne ek din kii chuttee par jane kaa elaan kar diya tha

 Speaking on the vote of confidence moved by the government in the Delhi Assembly, Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely said that if the AAP government works in the public interest, the party can support for a full five years
 unhone kaha, 'kejariwal ji aap lagaataar bayaan de rahe hai ki sarkaar 48 ghante kii he
 i assure you today that as long as you keep taking decisions in the interest of the people of Delhi, there is no threat to your government
 ' He said, "if needed, we will support you for five years so that you can give good government, as long as we feel that development is not being hampered by the decision you have made, we will continue to support you
" logon ke hit main or vikaas ke liye aap jo bhi faisla karte hai hamaari party kaa vahaan samarthan hoga
 ' congress netaa ne kaha ki unki party ne dilli ke logon ko ek or chunaav se bachaane ke liye sarkaar ko samarthan diya he
 However, Lovely attacked the government's decision to free electricity and water supply, saying that the House can decide on the transfer of subsidy from one place to another, not the government
 lavali ne mukhyamantri se kaha, 'aap sarkaar main naye hai
 The authorities should tell you very well
 pehle kii bajet ne kuch sabsidi manjuur kii thi or ab vah badal nahin saktaa
 The house should be shared
 aapako adhikariyon kii jimmedaari tay karnaa chahie, jinhone aapako gumraah kiya
 ' unhone is par bhi aashcharya jataayaa ki agar 1300 karod rupee sabsidi dene kaa faisla hota he to sarkaar kin vaadon ko thande baste main daalegi
 He also told Kejriwal that his government should take 'strict action' against the people and departments involved in corruption
 lavali ne kaha ki kejariwal ne jab dilli sarkaar ke bhrashtachar ke bare main baat kii thi to unhone emsidi ke bare main bhi baat kii thi

 is tareeke main kisi grah ke saamne se guzarane ke dauraan sitare kii chamak main ai maamuli kami ko darj kiya jaataa he
 According to the study published in the journal 'astronomical', other objects may mimic this method, so the Kepler data identifies objects resembling planets, but they require more analysis to truly prove planets
 Despite being the 1st candidate planet discovered by the @nasakepler telescope, Kepler-1658b had a rocky road to confirmation
 10 years later, scientists have now confirmed that it is, in fact, a planet
 It whips around its star every 3

 In response to questions related to the failure of the police to arrest former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda for about 10 days, Commission Chairperson Mamta Sharma said, 'I have met Geetika's family
 yah spasht he ki uskaa shoshan hua or vah khudakushi karne ko majaboor hui or is maamle main karrwai main deree se sabit heta he ki uskaa shoshan hua
 Former Haryana minister Kanda has been accused of abetment to suicide in the Geetika suicide case
 mamata ne sawaal kiya ki media tak postmortem report kaise pahunch gai jabaki hamen yaa mantralay ko yah report nahin mili
 The President said that the most unfortunate thing in this case is the post-mortem report, which we asked for but the police did not give us the report
 unhone kaha ki kanda ke aatmasamarpan ke baad ab police ko puri tarah se jaanch kerani chahie or aparaadhiyon ko sajaa honi chahie

 He tweeted that 'in this case, calling India a villain is a deliberate exercise to tarnish the image of India

 It undermines India's security

 Pakistan captain misbah-ul-haq tried his best to avoid the team's defeat, but he did not get any help from the other end
 misbah ne athak prayaas kiye lekin shami ne 76 ke nijee score par unka boria bistar samet diya
 Misbah hit 9 fours and 1 six in his innings
 dekhen, bharat kaa aglaa match kababharat kii ore se mohammad shami ne shandaar chaar wicket jatke, vahiin umesh yadav or mohit sharma ne do-do safalataa hasil kii, jabaki aswin or jadeja ko ek-ek safalataa mili
 Earlier, Ahmed Shehzad (47) and Sohail Khan (36) took over Pakistan's innings after losing the wicket of Younis Khan (6) to a score of 11
 ek samay khatarnaak dikh rahe donon ballebaajon kii is jodi ko aswin ne todaa
 Raina was caught by Sohail off Ashwin
 iske badadhoni ne umesh yadav ko gendbaaji ke morche par lagaaya
 Justifying his captain's decision, Umesh Yadav caught Shoaib Maqsood at the hands of Raina, while Umar Akmal was caught by Jadeja at the hands of Dhoni
 haalanki umr akmal ke liye gendbaaj kii apil ko ampire ne khaarij kar diya, jiske baad captain dhoni ne tisare ampire ke liye disijan rivyuu maanga or bharat ko paanchavin safalataa mil gai
 After five wickets fell, Shahid Afridi and misbah-ul-haq carried the responsibility of leading the innings
 donon ballebaajon ke bich punap rahi mahatvapurn saajhedaari ko mohammad shami ne todaa
 Afridi sat the ball in the air while picking up Shami's ball and Kohli made no mistake in catching the catch
 afridi kii jagah lene krij par aae wahaab riyaj bhi mohammad shami kaa shikaar bane
 He was caught behind the wicket by Dhoni on Shami's ball
 154 ran par saat wicket ganvaakar sankat main fansi apni team kii naiya paar lagane ke liye captain misbah ul haq ne akele ladane kii thaanee or sangharmpurn ardhashatak jadaa
 Misbah, along with Yasir Shah, added crucial runs for the eighth wicket and took the team's score to 200
 203 ke score par pakistan ko aathvaan jhatka mohit sharma ne diya
 Yasir was caught at the hands of Umesh Yadav within 30 yards in the wake of Mohit picking up the ball

 a target of 301 runs to win this match in front of Pakistan

 Kohli played a vigorous innings of 107 runs in 126 balls and held one end till the 45th over
 kohli ne apni pari main 8 chauke jade
 Know when India's next match is 
 This was the sixth World Cup match between India and Pakistan
 chah maichon main paanchavi baar toss bharat ke naam hua or paanchavi baar hi bharat ne ballebaaji bhi chuni
 Team India had already devised a strategy for the batsmen to land on the pitch with two spinners, so both Jadeja and Ashwin became part of the team
 pakistan ne bhi ek specialist leg spinner yasir shah par daanv lagaaya or iske liye team ke specialist vikatkiper sarfaraj ahamed ko baahar kar umr akmal ko wicket ke peeche kii jimmedaari di gai
 Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan got off to a decent start, but Rohit Sharma's haste gave Pakistan a chance before both batsmen opened their hands
 pichley kuch maichon main rohit ne shandaar paariyaan kheli hai lekin jin pariyon main wo ran nahin banaate unamem unka out hone kaa tarika hameshaa sawaalon ke ghere main hi rahata he
 15 runs came off his bat and Misbah caught him in an attempt to pull on Sohail Khan's ball
 viraat kohli krij par aate hi ran gati badhaane kii koshish kii
 Shikhar Dhawan also came to play
 bade match kaa pressure liye bina donon ne pakistani ballebaazi ko bina kisi pareshaani ke khelaa
 Together, they took the team to the first 100 and then 150
 is dauraan donon apni apni half centuri bhi puri kar chuke the
 By the 30th over, the team's score had reached 163 and in an attempt to take a run on the same score, the duo faltered and Dhawan, standing at the non-striker end, could not reach the crease before Misbah's throw
 lekin itane bade match main 76 gendon par kheli 73 ranon kii shikhar kii ye pari itihaas main darj jarur ho gai
 In front of Virat, Pakistani bowlers were filling the water and their fielders were giving up one catch after another, encouraging Virat to move forward
 3, 16 or 76 par mili teen jeevanadaanon kaa phayda uthaate hue viraat ne shatak kii ummiden jagaa deen
 At the other end, he was joined by Suresh Raina, who started ramming runs as soon as he came
 donon ne milakar kareeb 7 kii ausat se ran banane shuru kiye
 15
 3 over tak chali partnership main donon ne kul 110 ran jod daale
 During this time, Virat also did the charisma that no Indian batsman had done in the World Cup against Pakistan till date
 sachin tendulkar ke 2003 worldcup main banaae 98 ranon ke record ko peeche chhodkar viraat ne jabardast shatak jamaa diya
 Virat scored 107 runs in 126 balls, in which he hit 8 fours
 sohail khan kii gend par umr akmal ko kaich thamane se pehle viraat bhi bhartiya cricket itihaas kii ek beshkeemtee pari khel chuke the
 Now the expectation of 300 was awakened
 bade match main raina apane rang main the or pakistani gendbaaj sakate main
 With the help of 5 fours and 3 sixes in just 56 balls, 74 runs became the third victim of Sohail Khan
 iske baad dhoni aae or badi ummiden laae, lekin deth overs main pakistan ke gendbaajon ne vaapasi ke liye qamar kas lee thi
 Now it became difficult for India to make big shots
 wahaab riyaj or sohail khan kii gendon ne team india kaa imtihaan lenaa shuru kar diya
 Jadeja (3), Dhoni (18) and Rahane returned without opening an account
 alam ye rahaa ki antim paanch overon main bharat ne keval 27 ran banaae or is dauraan paanch wicket ganvaae
 Sohail Khan, who has taken 5 wickets in his first World Cup match against India, will also be remembered for this match
 khayr aakhri over main mohammad shami or aar aswin ne milakar team india ko kisi tarah 300 tak pahunchaa diya
 This is the third highest score in a World Cup by a team in front of Pakistan

 If there was not an agile and loyal 'chetak' who spoke through the air, then the stories of Maharana Pratap's valor would not have been as full of heroism as they are today
 bihar ke ek diggaj netaa jo jharkhand banane ke baad nae rajya kii siyasat main ram gaye, sarayu raay kii kahani bhi bina 'chetak' adhuri hi he
 Now obviously, there will be no name of Chetak here
 kyonki assi ke dashak main ghod kii sawari to fabati nahi
 But 'bajaj Chetak' used to be the heartbeat of the youth at that time
 'harley davidson' par baithe aaj ke yuva kya hi itaraate honge jitna us samay 'chetak' kaa savaar itaraata tha
 Well, the glory of the scooter ever again
 lekin philhar to diggaj netaa sarayu raay ke chetak par hi baat karte hai
 Saryu Rai does not love this 'chetak' more or less than Maharana Pratap
 yahi vah scooter he jis par baithkar sarayu raay ne nabbe ke dashak main lalu yadav ke khilaaf chaara ghotaale kii ladaai ladi
 He says, "A senior CBI officer once said that i am in danger
" chaar pahie main security ke saath hi mujhe ghoomana chahie
 But i do not know why i feel that i am safe on my scooter ''
 vishwamitra kii tapobhumi baxur ke sarayu raay ke tevar bhi maharana pratap se kam nahin hai
 Saryu Rai, who has sent three Chief Ministers (lalu, Jagannath Mishra and Madhukoda) to jail, has also announced to send the current Chief Minister Raghuvar Das to jail in the Jharkhand assembly elections
 ghotaalon kaa pulinda liye sarayu raay kah rahe hai, '' teen ko jail bhijwa chuke ab chauthe kii baari he
 "so like Swami, devotee
" donon main thasak baraba
 The 'chetak' number of the DES-1490 number purchased in 1980 is still intact
 sarayu raay ke ek kareebi ne bataaya, ''scooter kii jhaad-pochh niyamit rup se hoti he
 "it is the order of Saryu Rai that 'chetak' should be maintained properly
" patna sthit raghuvansh apartment main aaj bhi yah scooter mahfuj he
 However, the ride of this scooter is rarely done now
 sarayu raay chetak ko bahut lucky maanate hai
 Here, Saryu Rai has rebelled against the BJP and has opened a front against the current Chief Minister
 udhar, chamchamata hua 'chetak' bhi vahi puraani thasak liye apane swami ke intjaar mustaid he
 Whatever happened to 'chetak' became special! Finance and Industry Minister Amit Mitra is the first Swami at the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, while the second Swami Saryu Rai was also the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Food Supply in Raghuvar Das's government
 sarayu raay bhi is scooter ko behad bhaagyashaalee maanate hai
 They say, Mitra and i become ministers only after riding this scooter
 haalanki sarayu raay kehete hai, ham donon hi kyon jitne logon ne is scooter kii sawari kii wo aaj raajnneeti or patrakarita ke kshetra main paracham laharaa rahe hai
 From Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, Union Ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ashwini Kumar Choubey or RJD stalwarts Lalu Prasad, Jagadanand Singh, Shivanand Tiwari and Abdul Bari Siddiqui all for some reason in the eighties
 Have rode this Chetak
 sarayu raay tak kaise pahunchaa chetak?aaj to haal yah he ki companiyaan dupahiyaa yaa chaar pahiyaa vaahan bechney ke liye aapako pachhiyaae rahati hai
 Your car after paperwork in three to four hours
 lekin pehle aisa nahin tha
 Bajaj Chetak was booked in 1970 and delivered in 1980
 do saal tak dilli main isaki sawari karne ke baad 1982 main mitra ne isko apane mitra sarayu raay ko bech diya tha
 After riding for 15 years, Saryu Rai gave it to his nephew Santosh Rai and went to politics in Jharkhand
 chetak ke pehle swami jo aaj ghor vampanthi party main mantri hai, 'amit mitra' 1980 main bhaajapa se chunaav ladanaa chaahate the
 When he came to India after studying at Duke University in the United States, he was attracted to the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and decided to raise the saffron flag
 ve patna aae or sangh ke headquarter main ruke
 Here he met Saryu Rai
 amit mitra bhaajapa ke tikat par loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa man bana chuke the, lekin sangh or bhaajapa kii sthaneey ikai kisi bahari ko ummidavaar banane ke paksh main nahin thi
 When the BJP did not get a chance, Amit Mitra became the national general secretary of the youth wing of the Janata Party
 khayr, siyasat main vichaardhaaraein mauka milane par panapati or sanwarti hai
 Ideologies also change their streams where they got the chance
 jaisaa ki amit mitra ke saath hua
 Suppose if at that time he would have been given a chance by Bihar's Sangh and bjp's local unit, he would not have been in Trinamool, the party with the very opposite ideology of the Sangh
 khayr, ab to yah kahana bhi mushkil he ki kab, koun, kis party main aayega or kab, koun, kis party se jayega?chhodie, hamen apni kahani se katai bhatkaan nahin he, to ham sarayu raay ke paas chetak kaise pahunchaa iskaa kissa bataate hai
 Rai told this story to a senior journalist in Bihar, read it like this, "I took Amit Mitra back on my Ambassador's motorcycle to show him the ruins of Nalanda University
 meri wo motor cycle chori ho gai to amit mitra apni bajaj 'chetak' scooter 1982 main mujhe bechakar videsh padhaane chale gaye kyonki unke man main raajnneeti ke prati duraav paidaa ho gaya tha''
 Amit Mitra, grandson of Subhash Chandra Bose returned to India in 1990 and was general secretary of FICCI for many years
 bharat sarkaar ne 2008 main mitra ko padmashri puraskaar se nawaja
 It was during this period that he came in contact with Mamta Banerjee

 safalataa aapke kadamon ko choomegi
 The Congress-led government in Madhya Pradesh is planning to sell the meat of Kadaknath chicken at a milk parlor to meet its growing demand
 haalanki, bhaajapa vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne sarkaar ke is kadam par yah kehete hue aitraaj jataayaa he ki isse hinduon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahonchegi kyonki hindu dharm main gaay or uskaa doodh ‚Äòpavitra' mana jaataa he
 Madhya Pradesh Animal Husbandry Minister Lakhan Singh Yadav said that the Madhya Pradesh State Livestock and Poultry Development Corporation has started a scheme to sell meat of Karkanath chicken at milk parlor in Vaishali Nagar area of bhopal in view of the increasing demand for Kadaknath
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòhamane pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main kadakanath murge kaa maance bechney ke liye praayogic taur par ek booth sthapit kiya he
 We are discussing plans to open such parlors across the state
 ' yadav ne kaha ki haalanki, is yojana kaa bhavishya payalat project kii safalataa par nirbhar he
 He said that at present the meat of Kadaknath is being sold at the rate of Rs 900 per kg
 isi bich, bhaajapa vidhayak rameshwar sharma ne sarkaar ke is kadam par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki hindu dharm main gaay or uskaa doodh behad pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is used in many festivals and in fasting
 gaay kaa doodh or kadakanath kaa maance ek booth main nahin bechaa janaa chahie
 He said that he would urge the government to set up a separate parlor to sell milk and meat of Kadaknath
 is aapatti ke bare main puche jane par mantri ne spasht kiya ki donon chijen bechney ke liye parlor ke bheetar alag alag cabin banaaye jaaenge
 It is known that Kadaknath chicken has its origin in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh
 visheshgyon ke anusaar kadakanath ke maance main aayran evam protein kii maatra bahut adhik hoti he, jabaki cholesterol kii maatra anya prajati ke murgon se kaaphi kam paayi jaati he
 Hence it is sold at a higher price than the hens of other species
 a post shared by The Nun (@thenunmovie) on Sep 4, 2018 at 6:05pm PDT The third contest of the Lok Sabha elections is tomorrow (23 April), with voting on 117 seats
 is charan main uttar pradesh kii jin das siton par matdaan hona he, unamem mainpuri, badaayun or firozabad bhi shaamil hai
 These three seats are the stronghold of the Mulayam Singh Yadav family
 is baar tasviir thodi alag he kyonki firozabad se shivpal yadav bhattije ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai
 In this way, the fate of four members of the Yadav family is to be decided in the third phase
 2014 main modi lahar ke baavjood bijepi mulaayam kunbe ke majboot kile ko bhed nahin saki thi
 Samajwadi Party's patron Mulayam Singh Yadav is contesting from Mainpuri seat
 mulaayam singh paanchavin baar yahaan se chunavi maidan main utre hai
 From the point of view of war, only BJP is in the name of opposition
 sapa kaa yah garh itnaa majboot he ki pichley 24 saal se yahaan kisi or party ko jeet naseeb nahin hui
 Even in 2014, despite the Modi wave, the SP candidate won by more than three and a half lakh votes
 haalanki, do seat se saansad bane mulaayam singh yadav ne mainpuri seat khaali kar di thi,jis par hue upachunaav main unke pote tej pratap singh yadav ne bijepi ummidavaar prem singh shakya ko 3 lakh 21 hajaar voton se haraaya tha
 From this, the strength of SP in Mainpuri can be gauged
 firozabad main bhattije ke saamne mulaayam ke bhai shivpalalekin badaayun va firozabad main is baar halaat juda hai
 Shivpal Singh Yadav has split from SP and formed his own party Progressive Samajwadi Party and he himself is contesting from Firozabad seat
 shivpal ke saamne unke bhattije yani ramgopal yadav ke bete akshay yadav hai
 The battle of uncle-nephew has made the election of Firozabad interesting this time
 yah ladaai sirf chunavi nahin, balki vajood kii bhi he
 The Firozabad seat is dominated by Jat, Muslim, Dalit and Yadav voters, but the SP, BSP alliance and Shivpal Yadav's entry into the political battle has made the contest interesting
 haalanki chachaa-bhattije ke bich ladaai main bijepi camel khilaane kii jugat main he
 However, even in Modi wave, BJP could not win this seat in 2014
 badaayun seat par congress ne nahin diya saaththik isi tarah hi badaayun main modi lahar kaa asar nahin hua tha or sapa ke tikat par mulaayam parivaar ke duusare sadsy dharmendra yadav lard rahe hai
 Sanghamitra Maurya, daughter of Yogi government minister Swami Prasad Maurya from BJP, is trying his luck and former Congress minister Salim Sherwani is in the race
 ye wo seat he jahaan congress ne yadav parivaar ke kisi sadsy ke khilaaf apana pratyaashee utaara he, jiske chalate muqabla trikoniya hota najar aa rahaa he
 Salim Sherwani has become the biggest headache in the way of Dharmendra Yadav from Badaun seat
 sherwani is seat se chaar baar saansad rahe hai
 In terms of caste equation, there are four and a half lakh Muslims, two and a half lakh Yadavs, three lakh Dalits, one lakh Jats, one and a quarter lakh Brahmins, one lakh Mauryas, one lakh Rajput voters
 aise main congress pratyaashee sherwani agar dalit, muslim or brahmanon ko saadhane main safal rahete hai to dharmendra ke liye hetric lagaana mushkil ho jayega
 At the same time, Sanghamitra Maurya is engaged in uniting Hinduism along with his society
 kul milakar tisare charan main upi kii jin siton par yadav parivaar ke sadsy chunaav lard rahe hai, unamem mulaayam singh yadav kii mainpuri seat ko chhodkar baaki donon jagah raah aasaan nahin hai
 In Firozabad, Shivpal Yadav of his family has spoiled the sp's equation, while in Badaun, the Congress has put up strong candidate Dharmendra Yadav
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav in chunautiyon se kaise apane parivaar ko bachaa pate hai

 ek sadsy aarvi dhulekar kaa zikr karte hue likhaa gaya he ‚Äì jab dhulekar ne hindustani main apni baat kehani shuru kii to adhyaksh ne unhen tokate hue kaha ki sabha main maujuud kai logon ko hindi nahin aati he or isliye vah unki baat samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 On this, Dhulekar stunned and said that those who do not know Hindustani do not have the right to live in this country
 ' In 1963, Nehru gave direction to the Official Language Act, under which he pointed out that since 1965 all forms of communication would be officially done in Hindi and English could be used as a subsidiary language
 is
 nehru ke is sanket ne hindi virodhiyon ke kaan khadey kar die
 He got a hint of doubt in this 'can' that the center might 'impose' Hindi on non-hindi speakers, English could be eliminated and not only that Hindi was also given the status of national language along with Rajbhasha
 Go itane virodh ke baad jaahir he congress apane faisle par naram padati nazar ai or shastri ne ol india radio par raashtra ke naam sandesh main saaf kiya ki angreji kaa istemaal tab tak kiya ja saktaa he jab tak janata chaahe
 At the same time, removing the fear of non-hindi speakers, he assured that every state can decide on its own that in which language it wants to do official work or communication, it can be regional language or even English
 saath hi kendriya str par hindi ke saath saath angreji bhi pramukh taur par kaamkaaj or sanchaar kii bhashaa hogi
 After such strong opposition, Hindi got the status of the official language of India, but the status of 'national language' continued to get
 yah baat alag he ki kai schuli kitabon main hindi ko rashtriya bhashaa bataa diya jaataa he jo ki tathyaatmak rup se galat he kyonki bharat kii koi rashtriya bhashaa he hi nahin
 No one has the status of a national language in the Indian Constitution
 rajbhasha vibhaag dwaara yah saaf kiya gaya he ki hindi ke saath hi saath angreji ko bhi sansad or centre main kaamkaaj ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the states have the right to decide their own language under the legislature, as a result of which 22 languages have official status in India, including English and Hindi
 alag alag maukon par adaalat dwaara yah saaf kiya gaya he ki in sabhi bhashaaon ko barabari kaa darja hasil he or koi bhi bhashaa kisi se bhi kam yaa zyada nahin he
 There is another interesting anecdote in the book written by Guha
 radio par laal bahadur shastri kii is ahm ghoshnaa ke baad ek baar phir jab yah maamla sansad main uthaa to anglo bhartiya sadsy frank anthony ne angreji ko sweekaar nahin karne kii hindi bhashiyon kii 'ashishnutaa' par chintaa jataai
 In response to this, JB Kripalani jokingly said that Frank should not worry about the ending of his language (english) in India because 'now even our children are starting to speak amma-appa and not Mummy Papa
 yahaan tak kii ham apane kutton se bhi angreji main hi baat karte hai
 Kripalani taunted the English with its feet and gave Anthony the 'confidence' that the English could disappear from England but never from India
 
 
 guha kii likhi kitaab main ek or dilachasp kissa he
 After this important announcement by Lal Bahadur Shastri on the radio once again when the matter came up in Parliament, Anglo Indian member Frank Anthony expressed concern over the 'intolerance' of the Hindi speakers of not accepting English
 iske jawaab main je bi kriplani ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki frank ko bharat main apni bhashaa (angreji) ke khatm hone kii chintaa nahin kerani chahie kyonki ‚Äòab to hamaare bachche bhi ammaa-appa nahin mummy papa bolne lage hai
 We even talk to our dogs in English
 ‚Äô apane pair jamaa chuki angreji par kriplani ne tanj kasate hue anthony ko ‚Äòvishwaas‚Äô dilaayaa ki england se angreji gaayab ho sakati he lekin bharat se kabhi nahin

 The Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel and the Finance Ministry have been asked several important questions on the demonetization decision by the Public Accounts Committee
 in sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye 20 janvari tak kaa samay diya he
 Actually, this committee of Parliament wants to know when, how and by whom the decision of Kinotbandi was taken
 in sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye rigerv bank ne sansadeey samiti ke liye ek note taiyaar kiya he jisase is faisle ko lene kii puri paristhiti kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 India Today has a copy of this RBI note in which several revelations related to the decision have been made
 jaaniye notebandi par sansadeey samiti ke sawaalon par 20 janvari ko rigerv bank kya jawaab dene ja rahi he-1
 The decision of demonetisation was a joint decision of both the central government and the Reserve Bank, which closed the 500 and 1000 rupee currency prevalent in the economy
 2
 The most important reason behind the decision of demonetisation was to completely stop the communication of fake currency in the country
 3
 The Reserve Bank wanted a new currency of 5000 and 10,000 rupees to be exchanged instead of 500 and 1000 rupees
 is aashay rigerv bank ne kendra sarkaar ko oktober 2014 main salaah di thi
 4
 2000 rupee kii nai karency ke sanchaar ko desh main mahangaai dekhte hue chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the closure of the old currency from this new currency was in the interest of currency communication in the economy
 5
 The Reserve Bank has said that the new currency of 2000 rupees to attract the attention of the common man, hence the decision was taken along with demonetisation and communication of this new currency
 6
 The Reserve Bank has stated that the printing press was instructed in June 2016 to print a series of new currency of 2000 rupees
 7
 After the commencement of printing of new currency from June 2016, the Reserve Bank said that a sufficient amount of stock was ready, so on November 7, 2016, the Central Government wrote a letter to the Reserve Bank, after which the Reserve Bank's Central on November 8, 2016 The board held a meeting and the gadget notification for demonetisation was issued the same day
 8
 Prior to the announcement of demonetisation, the Reserve Bank was aware that it is not possible to completely replace the old currency
 saath hi bank ke sangyaan main tha ki die gaye samay main nai karency ke vailu or wolum ko puraani karency ke baraabar karne ke kaam ko nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 9
 rigerv bank ko bharosa tha ki digital pement kaa vikalp karency badalane kii prakriya main sahaayak hoga
 This will reduce the pressure of demand for new currency in the economy
 10
 The entire demonetization process will not have any impact on the Reserve Bank's balance sheet

 This time the results of the Lok Sabha elections are shocking to the political pundits, they are also quite unique in some sense
 desh ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar hoga ki koi danpati saath-saath loksabhaa main najar aayega, vah bhi alag-alag partiyon ke tikat se jitkar
 Both Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav and his wife Ranjita Ranjan, who are included in the Bahubalis of Bihar, are about to reach the threshold of the Lok Sabha by winning
 yah apni tarah kaa pehla maamla hoga
 Luckily, there has never been any separation-separation situation between the couple's marriage

 Apart from this, after the video of the weapon waving went viral, the BJP leadership showed the champion the way out of the party

 After Anurag Thakur was removed from the post of BCCI President, there is a lot of discussion in the media that Sourav Ganguly could become the next BCCI President
 lekin agar lodha panel kii siforeeshon par gaur kiya jaae to saurav bisisiai ke adhyaksh nahin ban sakate hai
 Sourav Ganguly is not technically eligible to become the BCCI President
 supreme court dwaara lodha panel kii siforishein lagu hone ke baad bisisiai yaa rajya board kaa sadsy banane ke liye niyamon main kai badlaav hue hai jisamen adhyaksh kii niyukti ko lekar bhi kuch badlaav kiye gaye hai
 According to the recommendation of the Lodha panel, no member of the BCCI or the state board can become a member for two consecutive terms
 ek turm khatm hone ke baad teen saal kaa ‚Äúkool of‚Äù yani teen saal kaa antaraal hona chahie
 Through the recommendations of the Lodha panel, it has been ensured that the powers of any post are not misused, hence the tenure of the members should be three years
 koi bhi sadsy lagaataar do baar bisisiai yaa rajya board kaa sadsy nahin ban saktaa he
 The question also arises as to whether he can become a member of the BCCI after finishing his tenure as a member of the state board for three years, the answer is no
 yah bisisiai ke sadasyon ke liye bhi lagu hota he
 That is, no member of the BCCI can become a member of the state board after completing his three-year term
 do kaarykaal ke bich teen saal kaa antaraal hona chahie
 If no officer has completed three years at the time of election, he can contest the election
 jaise koi bhi adhikari agar rajya board ke sadsy ke rup main teen saalon main se do saal puure kar chukaa he or ek saal bachaa hua he to vah apane pad se istipha dene ke baad rajya board ke duusare pad yaa bisisiai ke kisi bhi pad ke liye chunaav lard saktaa he lekin chune jane ke baad vah vyakti is pad par sirf ek saal rah saktaa he
 That is, after one year, he will have to leave this post
 tippaniyan All this applies in the case of Sourav Ganguly
 saurabh ganguli ab bengal cricket association ke sadsy hai
 On June 2017, Sourav Ganguly will complete three years
 aise main saurav ganguli ko bisisiai yaa rajya board kaa sadsy banane ke liye teen saal intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Sourav Ganguly can contest for any post of BCCI or State Board after three years i
e
 after June 2020
 lekin agar saurav ganguli june 2017 se pehle bengal cricket association kaa pad chhod dete hai or phir bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav ladate hai or jeet jate hai to vah sirf june 2017 tak is pad par rah sakate hai

 is baithak main nirmala sitaraman or narendra singh tomars ke saath hi himachal ke netaa jairam thakur, narendra bargatha or suresh bharadwaj bhi rahenge
 The BJP had given the responsibility of contesting elections to Prem Kumar Dhumal in Himachal Pradesh, while CM Rupani was the commander in Gujarat
 nattejey to bijepi ke haq main aa gaye lekin donon hi senapatiyon ko ajeebogareeb vidambnaa se guzaranaa pad rahaa he
 While Dhumal licked the dust at Sujanpur seat of Hamirpur, Rupani's report card is weaker than expected
 yahi vajah he ki donon hi pradeshon main siem pad ke sabase bade daavedaaron ke daavon kii hawa nikal gai
 After the election results, a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Board was called and observers were appointed at both the places to decide the name of the Chief Minister
 vaise gujarat ke siem rupani bhi halke antar se mili jeet ke baad ye samaj rahe hai ki unki sthiti ab chunaav se pehle vaali nahin rah jaaegi
 They too now have no choice but to stare at the Observers who have been decided by the Parliamentary Board

 Among the new names, the name of Textiles Minister Smriti Irani is leading
 smriti irani ke paksh main sanghathan kshamta or gujarati bhashaa main maahir hona jaataa he
 Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya is running in the second place
 wo patidaar to hai hi, saath main kisaan bhi hai
 His name is considered among the ground leaders
 teesraa naam vajubhai vaala kaa he, jo kshatriya samaaj se ek majboot naam hai
 He is currently the Governor of Karnataka, but his anecdotal information about the organization and strong hold in Saurashtra may return him to the state
 zaahir he bijepi ke saamne 2019 kaa ran he or wo kisi bhi keemat par gujaratiyon ko or naaraaz karne kaa jokhim nahin le sakati
 With the defeat of Dhumal, many leaders have high hopes in the state of Panchokham Himachal
 prem kumaar dhumal apane hi puraane sahyogi or baagi banakar congress main pahunche rajindar rana se hamirpur kii seat par maat kha gaye
 His dream of becoming CM for the third time now seems to be shattering
 vaise dhumal ne apni haar ko party kii jeet ke saamne bahut chota bana diya
 After this defeat, Prem Kumar Dhumal said that personal defeat does not matter, the party won
 dhumal kii haar ne kai bijepi netaaon kii ummiden aasmaan par pahunchaa di hai
 Sources are telling that Jai Ram Thakur is the first name in the faces of the party which is considering to sit on Himachal's chair instead of Dhumal
 wo purvamantri to rahe hi hai, saath main unhone himachal main bataur bijepi adhyaksh bhi kaam kiya he
 Thakur also got a call from Delhi yesterday

 However, the name of Union Minister JP Nadda is also being considered
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki piem modi kii pasand nadda ko pichley dinon kaaphi pramot kiya gaya tha, lekin ain vakt par party ne dhumal kaa naam aage kar diya
 Despite this, Nadda was successfully organizing Modi and Shah's rally in his state

 The expense of making new documents in lieu of missing or damaged documents is paid on an actual basis up to a maximum amount of Rs 25,000
 ''policy khareednapolicy ko keval iffko-tokio ke shakha karyaalayon se kharida ja saktaa he, yah online uplabdh nahin he
 In most cases self-declaration of the value of the jewelery is sufficient

 If the person goes anywhere in the world wearing / wearing jewelery, then the jewelery is also covered

 Baluchandar Shekhar, CEO of Reneubydotcom, says, "the need to have separate insurance for the locker is dependent on the price and affordability of the contents of the locker

 virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kaa maananaa he ki ve donon ab bhi bharat kii sarvshereshth salaami jodi hai, lekin hakeekat yah he ki in donon ne lagbhag do saal or pichhali 20 pariyon se test cricket main koi shatkeey saajhedaari nahin nibhaai he
 Gambhir recently said that his and Sehwag's pair is the best opening pair in the country at the moment
 is par jab sahvaag se pratikriya dene ke liye kaha gaya tha, to unka bhi jawaab tha, haa aisa he
 In fact, the opening pair of Sehwag and Gambhir have scored 4110 runs at an average of around 53 from 81 innings for India, including 10 centuries and 24 half-century partnerships
 ve bharat kii number ek or duniya main paanchaven number kii sarvshereshth jodi hai
 But these two have not played big innings in the last two years, which has also affected their performance as the opening pair
 gambhir or sahvaag ne test cricket main aakhri shatkeey saajhedaari disambar, 2010 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf centurian main nibhaai thi
 Both of them then added 137 runs for the first wicket
 iske baad se sahvaag or gambhir 20 pariyon main pari kaa aagaaj kar chuke hai, lekin unki sarvshereshth saajhedaari 89 ran kii he, jo unhone pichley saal westeindies ke khilaaf dilli main nibhaai thi

 mukund iske alaava teen pariyon main dravid ke salaami jodidar bane the
 Of these remaining five pairs, only Gambhir and Mukund were able to play a half-century partnership in an innings

 They are India's number one and number five best pair in the world
 lekin pichley do saal ye donon badi paariyaan nahin khel paae hai, jiskaa asar salaami jodi ke rup main unke pradarshan par bhi padaa he
 Gambhir and Sehwag played their last century partnership in Test cricket in December 2010 against South Africa at Centurion
 tab in donon ne pehle wicket ke liye 137 ran jode the
 Since then, Sehwag and Gambhir have started innings in 20 innings, but their best partnership has been 89 runs, which they played against West Indies in Delhi last year
 in donon ne in pariyon main keval 30
 605 runs added at an average of 25
 inamen paanch ardhashtakeey saajhedaariyaan shaamil hai
 India tried some other couples including Gambhir and Sehwag during this period, but all failed
 sahvaag ne gambhir ke alaava murali vijay or rahul dravid ke saath do-do pariyon main pari kaa aagaaj kiya
 Abhinav Mukund along with Gambhir came in as an opener in an innings
 tamilnadu ke mukund or vijay ne chah pariyon main bhartiya pari kii bhi shuruyaat kii thi
 Mukund also became Dravid's opening partner in three innings
 in baaki paanch jodiyon main se keval gambhir or mukund hi ek pari main ardhashtakeey saajhedaari nibhaa paae the
 The comments bharat kaa england or australia daure main kharaab pradarshan kaa pramukh kaaran salaami jodiyon kaa nahin chal paanaa bhi rahaa
 The selectors have again reposed confidence in Sehwag and Gambhir and kept him in the squad as the main openers for the first two Tests against England
 unke alaava murali vijay or anjikya rahane ko bhi 15-sadasyeey team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 If Sehwag and Gambhir do well in the upcoming series, they could become the fourth best opening pair in the world

 Surprised by reaction of India to Pres Trump's offer of mediation to bring Pak & India to dialogue table for resolving Kashmir conflict which has held subcontinent hostage for 70 yrs
 Generations of Kashmiris have suffered & are suffering daily and need conflict resolution
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne likhaa: "upmahadweep ko 70 saal se ulajhaa kar rakhane vaale kashmir mudde ke hal ke liye vaarta kii mej par paak or bharat ko laane ke liye madhyasthata karne ke raashtrapati trump ke prastaav par bharat kii pratikriya se chakit hum
 "the Prime Minister of Pakistan said at the end of his first visit to the US," many generations of Kashmir have faced it (the Kashmir issue) and they are facing it daily and the conflict needs to be resolved
 " Significantly, Donald Trump in his meeting with Imran Khan at White House on Monday proposed to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir issue
 haalanki, bharat ne trump ke prastaav ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hue kaha he ki nayi dilli kaa yah ruukh barkaraar he ki pakistan ke saath lambit sabhi muddon par sirf dwipaksheeya charchaa hogi
 During a press conference with Imran Khan, Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to mediate the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan
 haalanki bharat ne iske kuch hi ghanton baad trump ke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said in a tweet, "prime Minister Narendra Modi has not made any such request to the US President
 " ab iske jawaab main america raashtrapati ke ek sheersh salaahkaar ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki donald trump managasaint baaten nahin karte hai
 When reporters at the White House asked Trump's chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, whether this (presidential claim) was concocted, he said, "this is a very rude question
" ' unhone kaha, 'raashtrapati managasaint baaten nahin karte hai

 aaj vishwa paryaavaran diwas he
 Indiscriminate felling of trees is also an important reason behind the decline in environmental and sanitation levels
 dharti beshumaar pedo se aachhadit he, lekin log apni suvidha or phaayde ke liye inhen jamkar kaat rahe hai
 Today the situation has become such that many areas have become barren due to the end of the forest
 paryaavaran diwas ke avasar par jaanate hai ki aaj jangal or pedo ke kya halaat hai
 In September 2015, a world-renowned science magazine based on science released a report that is based on the current state of forests and trees
 nechar ke alaava anya sroton (world wild life dot oarji, time dot com) se bhi vaishvik str par jangalon or ped kii hakeekat ke bare main talash kii gai he
 - There are 3 trillion or 3,040,000,000,000 (one lakh crore) trees worldwide
 - har saal 15
 3 billion trees are being cut
 is tarah se 2 ped prati vyakti se bhi zyada kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 According to scientists, at the time of the beginning of human civilization (about 12 thousand years ago), the number of trees on the earth has decreased by 46 percent in today's date
 duniya main teji se vanakshetra kam hota ja rahabharat main prati vyakti 28 ped- bharat ke lihaaj se baat karen to desh main prati vyakti sirf 28 ped hi aate hai
 The number of trees in India is around 35 billion
 jabaki china main 139 arab ped hai or prati vyakti ke lihaaj se 102 ped aate hai
 Globally, Russia has the highest number of trees with 641 billion trees, followed by Canada, Brazil and the United States with 318, 301 and 228 billion trees respectively
 - prati hectare ke hisaab se sabase ghaney ped uttari america, scandenvia or rus main hai
 There are about 750 billion trees (750,000,000,000) in these areas, which is about 24 percent of the global level
 - duniya ke jamini kshetra main kareeb 31 fisadi kshetra jangalon ke ghire hue hai, lekin inamen teji se giravat aati ja rahi he
 Between 1990 and 2016, 502,000 square miles (1
3 million square kilometers) of forest area from the world are over
 - india state of forest report (isaar) ke anusaar, 2017 main bharat main 708,273 squaire kilometre yani desh kii kul jameen kaa 21
 Only 54% of the forest area is forested
 jabaki siie kii world fact book 2011 ke anusaar, duniya main 39,000,000 squaire kilometre jameen par jangal hai
 The forests that are being destroyed as many as 27 football fields every day- According to the World Bank, the forests of areas far larger than South Africa have been eradicated from the world
 - pichley 50 saalon main amejan jangal ke kshetra main 17 fisadi kii kami ai he
 - Although people in the world are cutting down trees for their own benefit and are going to end the forests, but because of this forest, there are 12 million people in the world (13
 2 million) ko rojgaar mila hua he jabaki kareeb 4 karod 10 lakh logon ko is sector se jude anya maamalon main rojgaar mila hua he
 - Due to frequent erosion of trees, forest areas are constantly being destroyed
 ham salaana 1 karod 87 lakh (1
 87 million) acres of forest are being lost, that is, every minute 27 equal number of football fields are being destroyed
 cocota dweep kaa prayaas- ek dashak pehle tanzania kaa cocota dweep lagaataar pedo ke kaate jane ke kaaran jangalon kii jabardast kami aa gai thi or vahaan ke logon ko laga ki kshetra main ab phir se kabhi bhi jangal nahin dikhegaa, lekin paas ke penba dweep ne ek nai misaal pesh kii
 Work started to make the area green again in 2008 and since then till 2018 more than 2 million trees have been planted on Pemba and Kokota islands
 ukt aankade dikhaate hai ki pedo kaa katnaa or jangalon ke khatm hone kaa silsilaa tham nahin rahaa he
 If this continues, a large part of the earth will soon become barren
 jangal khatm ho gaye to karodon logon kii roji-roti chin jaaegi
 In such a situation, it is necessary to save the forests and keep the earth green, so that the coming generations can also see the beautiful earth
 kehete hai ki kudarat kabhi bhi kisi ko pareshaan nahin karti
 But this is just right as long as you don't tease it
 jangalon ko kancreet ke jangal main badalanaa ab insaanon par baari pad rahaa he
 Due to this, now the wild animals have also started moving out of their homes and moving towards the population
 insaan or jaanavar ke bich isi ladaai kaa sabase taaja manjar tajanagari agra main dekhne ko mila
 Where a leopard entered a house
 tendue ke hamale main ek yuvak jakhmighar main ghusaa tendua jabardast gusse main tha
 Anger is probably because he himself forgot his own house and came to human settlement
 isi gusse ke chalate use jo bhi insaan dikhataa usee par hamalaa kar detaa
 One person was badly injured in the attack and many of the survivors survived
 wo to ganimat rahi ki aam logon kii madad se van vibhaag ke afasaron ne is anachaahe mehmaan ko behosh karne main kamyaabi hasil kar lee, varanaa tasviir pataa nahin kya hoti
 The leopard wandered out of the population, in fact, reached Suresh Nagar Colony in Agra on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday
 raat ke andhere main aabaadi ke bich aate hi ye ek khaali pade makaan kii ore badha
 But when the watchman got an eye on him, the watchman did not realize that he was a leopard
 usne tendue ko khadeda or makaan main band kar diya
 But when the sound of his growling came from the house in the morning, the chowkidar's forehead sounded and he informed the landlord
 iske baad subah takreeban chah baje jab makaan maalik apane ek mitra ke saath maukey par pahunchaa, to andar kaa manjar dekh kar pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 For 15 hours, a leopard was sitting in the room outside the leopard in the city
 dekhte hi dekhte khabar jangal main aag kii tarah faili auraghar ke baahar saikadomlog jamaa ho gaye
 After which the leopard leapt from the inside and ran towards the ground outside
 isi dauraan tendue ke jhapatane se khurshid ali naam kaa ek shaks bhi zakhmi ho gaya
 But the very next moment the leopard turned back and entered the same house again, where he was still hid
 jiske baad van vibhaag kii team tendue ko pakadaney main jute gai

 bhartiya janata party ne centre sarkaar par jaanboojhkarkoyala ghotaaleki jaanch main deree karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said the government was deliberately trying to delay the investigation into the coal scam
 unhone kaha, sarkaar pehle ghotaalon ko chhipaani kii koshish karti he phir aaropon ko nakaarti he or ab jaanch main deree karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Nirmala Sitharaman was reacting to the non-receipt of documents related to the CBI cocollegate
 unhone kaha ki congress ne jaanboojhkar 2004 ke baad filein sibiai nahin bheji hai
 Together they demanded that the government should immediately hand over the necessary files to the CBI
 gauratlab hai kikoyala ghotaaleki jaanch main sibiai ko badi mushkil saamne aa rahi he
 The CBI has not yet received documents on allocation of 40 coal blocks from the Coal Ministry
 sibiai diarector ranjit sinha ne ye baat buudhvaar ko piesi ke saamne kahi
 The PAC expressed displeasure over the delay in the investigation of the coal scam

 An aircraft is flying at an altitude of thirty thousand feet
 sab kuch thik tha
 But then suddenly not only the plane's connection to the ground breaks but it also disappears from the radar
 sabko yahi lagata he ki plane shaayad krash kar gaya
 But then suddenly it comes to know that the plane kept flying in the sky for almost seven hours despite the loss of contact with the ground
 to kya das din pehle 239 musafiron ko lekar uda malaysia airlines kaa vimaan apartaaon ke kabje me he?pichley das dinon se duniya kii sabase badi mistry sabase bada rahasy yahi bana hua he ki aakhir 239 musafiron or kru memberon ko lekar aath march ko kuwalalampur international airport se uda malaysia airlines kaa bowing emech 370 vimaan gaya to gaya kahaan?kai aise sawaal hai jinhone duniya bhar kii jaanch agenciyon kii neend haraam kar rakhi he
 Thousands of miles were searched from the sky to the sea
 is sabase bade search oparation main duniya bhar ke hitech upkaran laga die gaye
 But no clue was found about the missing plane, however some such shocking information has definitely been found, which if true, would be very scary
 or wo sach ye he ki flite 370 main naa to koi takneekee kharabi ai thi or naa hi wo kisi haadase kaa shikaar hua he
 Rather, the communication equipment of the aircraft has been intentionally tampered with and that too for the purpose of hiding the aircraft from the eyes of the world and landing it in some secret place
 darasal is ashanka kii do ahm vajahen hai
 First, after all search operations, the wreckage of the aircraft has not been found yet
 duniya bhar main parmaanu visphoton par najar rakhane vaale sanghathan sitibitio ke mutabik uske sensors ne 8 march ko dakshin purv asia main koi blast ricard nahin kiya
 That is, if the plane had crashed, its sensors would have detected it
 or duusari vajah ye ki kuwalalampur international airport se udaan bharne ke ghante bhar baad hi vimaan kaa sampark air trephic control yani atisi se tut gaya tha
 This happens when there is a serious malfunction in the aircraft
 magar haroonges taur par atisi se sampark tuutane se ke baad bhi agle saat ghante tak vimaan udata rahaa
 But not on the route he had to go but in the wrong direction
 yani vimaan main koi takneekee khami nahin thi
 The wheels fitted in the missing Boeing 777-200 of Malaysia Airlines are very special
 in pahiyon kii madad se vimaan ko aam ranve ke alaava kisi soft ranve par bhi land karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Not only this, due to these special wheels, the aircraft can not only land on the short runway but can also take off
 is tarah ke vimaan ke jaankaron ke mutabik vimaan ke main landig gear yani pichley pahiyon main donon taraf chah-chah pahiyon kaa set laga hota he yani peeche kul 12 pahie hote hai
 Apart from this, bogie wheels also help in landing the aircraft on soft runway
 takanic ye he ki landing ke vakt vimaan kaa vajan 12 pahiyon par baraabar-baraabar padataa he
 Whereas in the rest of the model, all the weight goes on four or two wheels, so aircraft with such special wheels easily land on the raw ground or on the road
 isiilie shaq he ki kisi gupt jagah par asthai ranve par bhi vimaan ko land karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Now obviously if the aircraft has not crashed and landed safely, then it is not possible without a pilot
 to kya apartaaon ke saath laapata vimaan kaa payalat bhi mila hua he? yaa phir vimaan par kuch logon ne jabaran kabja kar liya? laapata plane main kul 227 musafir or 12 kru menmbar the
 Malaysian authorities extracted complete information about all passengers on board the aircraft
 is jaankaree ke baad ye saaf ho gaya ki vimaan main koi bhi sandigdh musafir savaar nahin tha
 That is, the needle of suspicion now moves directly towards the crew members
 laapata vimaan ko captain zahaari ahamed shah uda rahaa tha jabaki uskaa ko-payalat tha farik abdul hamid
 The needle of suspicion on both of these was going on since the American agencies found that the aircraft had been flying for seven hours even after the air traffic control lost contact
 52 saal kaa captain jahaari ahamed shah malaysia airlines ke sabase anbhavi payalts main se ek mana jaataa he
 Zahari Ahmed, who lives in a posh area of kuala Lumpur with a wife and three children, is a staunch supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim
 philhal kvalalampur main jahaari ahamed ke ghar par police kaa sakht paharaa bitha diya gaya he
 During interrogation of his family members, it is revealed that he came to the airport with his wife on the last flight
 cabin kru or musafiron ke saath bhi garmjoshi se mila tha
 Even the last message given to ATC during the flight did not contain anything strange
 ab sawaal ye he ki vimaan agar jahaari ahamed or uske ko-payalat ne hi hijank kiya he to unka makasad kya he? or sabase bada sawaal ye ki agar plane hijank hi hua he to phir use utaara kahaan gaya he
 Because the plane cannot fly in the air for ten days? shahrukh khan kii beti suhana kaa doston ke saath game khelte hue ek video viral ho rahaa he

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is facing the toughest challenge of his life, which continues to grow like the mouth of Sursa
 congress ke saamne apni hasti bachaane kaa sankat he
 The party is looking towards Rahul, but the Congress vice-president seems to be stuck in dharmasankut, he lacks foresight
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki rahul is bhavar se nikal nahin sakate
 All they need is the right charioteer who can guide them
 16 kalaon ke avatar shrikrishna kaa jivan rahul ke liye prerana ban saktaa he
 Rahul can find the formula of victory from Krishna's life
 gita or upanishad padhane kii baat karne vaale congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi yogeshwar krishna ke jivan se safalataa ke ye 5 mantra paa sakate hai
 Which can make them victorious in the 'mahabharata' of power
 kisi bhi sthiti main hatotsahit na horahul gandhi krishna ke jivan se yah sabak le sakate hai ki kisi bhi paristhiti main hatotsahit na hon
 No matter how weak the party's position is
 congress ke paas 44 siten hai or agar yah 4 bhi ho jaae to rahul par koi asar nahin hona chahie
 You should continue your fight with great concentration
 parivaar or apano ke moh se upar uthnakurukshetra main arjuna ko gita kaa upadesh dete hue krishna unhen yahi bataate hai ki saamne jo log khadey hai wo aapke shatru hai, dada, chachaa or bhai nahin
 And killing them to protect religion will not be a sin
 rahul gandhi yah sikh le sakate hai ki jo log party ke kaam ke nahin he, chaahe wo parivaar ke ho, dost ho yaa sage sambandhi
 Get them out of the party immediately
 chunavi ran main jeet hasil karne ke liye unhen apano ke khilaaf bhi jang ladani hogi
 Struggle is life The life of Kanhaiya who grazes more than 500 cows with Gwal Bal in Hagokul is full of struggles
 din bhar bina bhojan gaay charaane vaale nand ke lallaa ko shaam ko bhojan naseeb hota
 His maternal uncle Kansa used to keep on making moves to kill him
 krishna kabhi in baadhaon se vichlit nahin hue
 They continued to struggle on the path of life
 rahul gandhi ko bhi yahi karnaa he
 Everyone has to face injustice in life and struggle is on everyone's part
 rahul ko inase ghabraana nahin chahie
 Rather go on your way
 fal kii chintaa kiye bane kartavya karte rahanaa he
 Strategy and diplomacyhindu texts did not contain a greater strategist and diplomat than Sri Krishna
 kis raja ko kis daanv par shikast deni he or kaise amuk ko marava dena he
 This was the result of Krishna's diplomacy
 magadh ke raja jaraasandh ke khilaaf krishna ne jis kootneeti kaa parichay diya or bhim ke haathon jis tareeke se maravaaya
 He could only do Krishna
 kaalyavan vadh se bhi rahul sikh sakate hai ki jab do shatru aapako ghere ho to kaise tisare kii madad se apane shatru kaa naash karvaa den
 But for this Rahul will have to get on the ground and join the public
 kyonki iske bina na to ranneeti banegaa or na hi kootneeti
 The Kauravas had the Akshohini and Chaturangini forces in Jeetnakurukshetra
 krishna ne duryodhana ko apni sena bhi de di thi
 Krishna knew that he was a great warrior against the Pandavas
 chaturangini senaayen hai
 Winning is difficult, but winning was necessary for founding religion
 krishna na to ghabaraaen or na hatotsahit hue
 In diplomatic and political moves, he killed every maharathi of the Kauravas and tied the forehead of the defeated Pandavas with victory
 pichley ek saal main ek karod rojgaar dene ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke daawey par congress ne palatwaar kiya he
 The Congress says that Cabinet Minister Nitin Gadkari himself has said in the Modi government that there are no jobs in the country, it is wrong for PM Modi to call the Employees Provident Fund (EPFO) data as jobs
 pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara ek saakshaatkaar main rojgaar par die gaye vaktavy par congress pravaktaa pawan kheda ne kaha ki sarkaar kii taraf se virodhabhasi bayaan die ja rahe hai
 Sometimes it is said that there are no figures, sometimes it is said that in the year one crore jobs were given
 ipiefo ke aankadon ko naukari bataanaa galat he
 He said that to tell the trucks cleaners jobs is to play with the data
 congress pravaktaa pawan kheda ne kaha ki aankade bataate hai notebandi se asangathit kshetra main ek karod se zyada naukariyaan gai hai
 The government stopped the survey of the Labor Bureau so that the correct figures are not revealed
 vahiin mudra yojana ke 51 fisadi labhaarthiyon kaa lone 23000 rupye he
 What will happen with this? Let me tell you that in the interview given to the news agency ANICO, Prime Minister Modi said that when India is developing fastest among the major economies of the world, then how can it be said that there is nothing on the employment front Happening
 loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav par die apane bhaashan ko doharaate hue piem modi ne sawaal kiya ki desh main nivesh bad rahaa he, sadak nirmaan, rail line bichaane kaa kaam, solar park banane or transmishan line ke vistaar kaa kaam teji se ho rahaa he, to phir kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki naye rojgaar nahin milenge ?vahiin karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi (ipiefo) ke aankadon kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha tha ki 45 lakh naye khate khole gayi hai or pichley 9 maah ke dauraan 5
 68 lakh people have joined the new pension scheme
 isse pataa chalata he ki pichley saal main 1 karod se zyada logon ko rojgaar mili hai
 The PM also said that the propaganda about employment should be stopped now
 kyonki logon ko ab isse zyada fark nahin padane vaala nahin he

 yadi unhen film pasand aati he, to vah nirdeshak-koreographer prabhudeva ke saath kaam karengi
 The comments ek kaarykram ke dauraan shridevi se yah puche jane par ki kya vah prabhudeva ke saath film main kaam karne ja rahi hai, unhone kaha, is samay main kai sari filmon kii kahaniyaan sun rahi hum
 Prabhudheva has always been my favorite dancer, actor and choreographer
 yadi mauka mila, to main unke saath jarur kaam karnaa chaahuungi
 Sridevi made a comeback to films with the English 'english Vinglish' last year after a long gap of 15 years, but after that, there is no news of her next film
 prabhudeva or shridevi ko is saal international indian film acedemi (ipha) awords main saath nrity karte dekha gaya tha
 During an event when asked by Sridevi whether she was going to work in a film with Prabhudheva, she said, "I am listening to stories from a lot of films right now
" prabhudeva hameshaa se mere pasandida dancer, abhinayta or koreographer rahe hai
 If i get a chance, i would definitely like to work with them
 shridevi ne 15 saalon ke lambey antaraal ke baad pichley saal film 'english winglish' se filmon main vaapasi kii, lekin uske baad ab tak unki agali kisi film main kaam karne kii khabar nahin ai he

 sabaki nigahen is baat par hai ki uri ke sena base camp par hamale ke baad bharat sarkaar kya faisla karti he
 From Sunday to Monday, regular meetings of ministers, officers and army chiefs of the respective departments of the government continued
 in vibhaagon main apatkaaleen maahaul he
 This time you will see the change that the government is also silent
 bijepi ke netaaon kii bayaanbazi band he
 Statements such as 'jaw dislocation in lieu of a tooth' have also been suggested to be avoided
 agar kahin kuch nahin badla he, to vah he soshal media or channelon ke panel
 You can be confident about the kind of things that supporters and opponents are talking about on social media, how much the level of public debate on such issues has fallen
 virdohi chunaav purv bayanon ko nikaal kar pradhanmantri se puch rahe hai ki bataaiye kya karenge
 Many used to say that i will cut ten heads instead of one, now it is time to bring them, bring it and show it
 lav letters likhane kaa time chalaa gaya to bataaiye ki koun sa time aayaa he
 From the perspective of asking the opponents or critics, it seems as if they are also demanding that the time has come to show war
 duusari taraf samarthak bhi yuddh ke liye lalkaar rahe hai
 Everything has failed, now only war is left
 sabak sikhaanaa hoga
 The Prime Minister must decide now, history is waiting for him
 paanch-chah hazaar twit ke dam par unhen sidhe yuddh par aa jane ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 The hashtag is being called a national poll
 aap dekh sakate hai ki virdohi or samarthak donon kii bhashaa or soch main kis tarah kii giravat ai he
 After this, commentary starts on where they went who talk about peace and talk of conversation
 sabase pehle desh ke bheetar aise logon par sargical strike kerani hogi
 Would you not like to see how an attack has made us clash with each other and become the same? shapath grahan samaaroh main nawaz sharif ko bulaanaa, yaa unke janmdin par lahore janaa, kya ye pramaan nahin he ki bharat sarkaar bhi baatcheet ke raste par yakeen karti he
 Whether these decisions were taken by asking those who talked about peace
 pradhanmantri ke in donon rajanyik faislon ko master stroke bataaya gaya
 Especially from his side who have been advocating war in 'prime time' since Sunday night
 kya pradhanmantri ke liye itnaa aasaan he ki ve hashtag ke hisaab se faisla le len jinaki sankhya bees yaa pachis hazaar bhi nahin hoti he, jo iske dam par rashtriya janamat kaa daawa ban jane kaa daawa karte hai
 Are advocating a nuclear attack without thinking
 sarkaar ko tarah tarah ke suzav bhi de rahe hai
 At times, these suggestions suggest that the government did nothing after the Pathankot attack in January this year
 abhi haal main china main ji-20 sammelan main duniya ke tamaam bade netaaon ke bich pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki dakshin asia main sirf ek desh he jo aatankwaad failaa rahaa
 Those who are spreading this epidemic should be banned, they should be isolated and not honored
 hamaare liye aatankwaadi aatankwaadi he
 Not only this, he also pointed towards Pakistan in US Congress
 bharat kii pashchimi seemaa se lekar africa tak, naam bhale alag-alag hon, lashkar-e-taiyaba se lekar taliban or issis (ISIS), iskaa darshan ek hi he, nafrat, hatya or hinsa

 sena, khufia yaa kootneeti ke paaramparik hathiyaaron se hi ye ladaai nahin jiti ja sakati
 The Prime Minister has been continuously talking about isolating the country that encourages terrorism from every platform
 ab aate hai raksha mantri par
 His constant statements about cross-border terrorism keep coming
 2015 main raksha mantri kaa ek bayaan he ki 2014 kii tulana main is baar 65 se 70 fisadi adhik aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 They always say that the gun is not for eating but for driving
 yah sawaal mahatvapurn to he ki sena ke base camp par aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kaise kiya
 If India follows a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, then how did the military base after Pathankot get attacked
 yah sawaal aakhir kyon chhod diya ja rahaa he
 Our Director General of Military Operations, DGMO Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh has told that the search operation in Uri has been completed
 aatankwaadiyon se chaar eke 47 rifl, chaar under bairal grenade launture, 39 under bairal grenads, 5 hand grenade, do radio sets, do jeepies, do map shits, do matrix shits baraamad hue
 Apart from this, a large number of food and medicine packets were found which had the seal of Pakistan
 itnaa sabakuch lekar ye andar tak aa gaye
 Pathankot managed to do so even eight months after the attack
 bhartiya sena ne is saal 17 ghuspaith ke maamalon ko naakaam kiya he
 This year, 110 terrorists have been killed in separate operations, of which 31 have been killed during incursions
 pichhali do ghuspaith main bhi aath aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya gaya he, phir bhi pichley teen chaar saalon kii tulana main is saal ghuspaith bad gai he
 Russia has canceled a joint military exercise with Pakistan
 china ne bhi kaha he ki vah har tarah ke aatankwaad ke khilaaf he
 The United States and Britain have also condemned, but can the condemnation be called a mobilization against Pakistan
 ninda to har baar hoti he
 The US who killed Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil needs to tell us something new about Pakistan, which has recently submitted documents related to the Pathankot attack to India
 pakistan ke raksha mantri khwaja asif ne kaha he ki hamaari dharti par koi kadam rakhega to ham gurez nahin karenge newclear vepans istamaal karne main
 If any country talks about the use of nuclear weapons and the world does not matter, then on what basis should we believe that the countries of the world are serious about terrorism
 pakistan ko alag-thalag karne main dilchaspee rakhte hai
 India's nuclear doctor says that India will never use it first
 agar bhartiya seemaa yaa bhartiya sena par newclear hamalaa hua tabhi apane parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istamaal karegaa
 Those who talk about nuclear attacks, whether they are in Pakistan or India, have no idea what they are talking about
 bharat main kisi bhi zimmedaar vyakti ne aisi baaten nahin kii he
 In response to the statement of the Defense Minister of Pakistan, no minister has talked about the use of nuclear weapons
 tippaniyan a series of meetings continued throughout the day in New Delhi on Monday
 sabase pehle grahamantralay main baithak hui
 The Minister of Defense, National Security Advisor, RAW Chief, Director of Intelligence Bureau, Secretary of Home and Defense, Director General of BSF and CRPF, many senior officials of security agencies were involved
 uske baad raksha mantri or grih mantri ne pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii jahaan vitt mantri jetali, sena pramukh bhi maujuud the
 After that the Prime Minister has met the President and apprised them of the situation
 ranneetik faislon ko lekar media main bayaanbazi band he
 Are the defense experts informed by the two-day meetings that India has reacted correctly
 baukhalaahat kii bajaay sarkaar ke bheetar bechaini ke baad bhi sanyam kisi nai ranneeti kaa sanket he yaa soshal media ke tamaam khemon ko niraashaa haath lagi he
 We will also talk about the martyrs in 'prime time', whose arguments got silent when the mortal remains reached their village home
 ham baat karenge ki pichley do saal main pakistan ko lekar bharat ko kya karnaa chahie tha, jo kiya ja rahaa he wo kyon nahin kaaphi he yaa ullekhneey he

 From conversation to diplomacy, everything is useless, so what is effective
 kai baar in sujhaavon se lagata he ki sarkaar ne isi saal janvari main pathankot hamale ke baad kuch kiya hi nahin
 Recently, at the G20 summit in China, Prime Minister Modi said that among the top leaders of the world, there is only one country in South Asia which was spreading terrorism
 jo is mahamari ko failaa rahe hai un par pratibandh lagane chahie, unhen alag-thalag kiya janaa chahie na ki sammanit kiya janaa chahie
 Terrorist is terrorist for us
 yahi nahin amareeki congress main bhi unhone pakistan kii taraf ishaara kiya tha
 From the western border of India to Africa, the names may vary, from lashkar-e-taiba to the Taliban and Isis (ISIS), its philosophy is the same, hate, murder and violence
 haalanki isaki chaaya duniya bhar main pad rahi he lekin yah paidaa ho rahaa he bharat ke pados main
 These battles cannot be won by conventional weapons of military, intelligence or diplomacy
 pradhanmantri lagaataar aatankwaad ko protsaahit karne vaale mulk ko alag-thalag karne kii baat har manch se karte aa rahe hai
 Now come to the Defense Minister
 seemaa paar aatankwaad ko lekar unke lagaataar bayaan aate rahete hai
 In 2015, the Defense Minister has a statement that 65 to 70 percent more terrorists have been killed this time than in 2014
 ve hameshaa kehete rahete hai ki bandook goli khaane ke liye nahin balki chalaane ke liye he
 The important question is how the militants attacked the army base camp
 agar bharat aatankwaad ke prati zero tolerance kii niti par chalata he to pathankot ke baad sena ke thikaane par hamalaa kaise ho gaya
 Why is this question being left out? hamaare sainya karrwai ke mahanideshak yani dijiemo lefnitant general ranbir singh ne bataaya he ki uri main search aaparishan puraa ho gaya he
 Four AK 47 rifles, four under-barrel grenade launchers, 39 under-barrel grenades, 5 hand grenades, two radio sets, two GPS, two map sheets, two matrix sheets were recovered from the terrorists
 iske alaava kaaphi sankhya main khaane or dawa ke packet baraamad hue jin par pakistan kii muhar thi
 They came all the way with so much
 pathankot hamale ke aath maheene baad bhi aisa karne main safal ho gaye
 The Indian Army has foiled 17 infiltration cases this year
 is saal alag-alag oparation main 110 aatankwaadi maare gaye hai, jinamein se 31 ko ghuspaith karte vakt maaraa gaya he
 Eight terrorists have also been killed in the last two incursions, yet the infiltration has increased this year compared to the last three to four years
 rus ne pakistan ke saath hone vaala saajha sainik abhyaas ko radd kar diya he
 China has also said that it is against all forms of terrorism
 america or britain ne bhi ninda kii he, lekin ninda ko kya pakistan ke khilaaf golbandi kah sakate hai
 Condemnation happens every time
 america jisane pakistan kii dharti par osama bin laden ko maaraa he use pakistan ke bare main kya nayaa kuch bataane kii zarurat he, jisane haal hi main pathankot hamale se sambandhit dastauez bharat ko saunpe hai
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif has said that if we take any step on our soil, we will not do anything to use nuclear weapons
 parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa istamaal karne kii baat koi desh kare or duniya ko koi fark hi na pade to ham kis aadhaar par maane ki duniya ke desh aatankwaad ko lekar gambhir hai
 Interested in isolating Pakistan
 bharat kaa newclear doctorin yah kahata he ki bharat kabhi bhi pehle istamaal nahin karegaa
 Only if there is a nuclear attack on the Indian border or the Indian Army, it will use its nuclear weapons
 parmaanu hamale kii baat karne waalon ko chahen wo pakistan main hai yaa bharat main hai, unhen andaaza nahin he ki ve kya baat kar rahe hai
 No responsible person in India has said such things
 pakistan ke raksha mantri ke bayaan ke jawaab main bhi kisi mantri ne parmaanu hathiyaar ke istamaal kii baat nahin kii he
 The comments somvaar ko nai dilli main dinabhar baithkon kaa silsilaa chalata rahaa
 The first meeting was held in the Ministry of Home Affairs
 raksha mantri, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar, ro chif, khufia beuro ke nideshak, grih or raksha sachiv, biguef or siarpief ke mahanideshak, suraksha agenciyon ke kai bade adhikari shaamil the
 The Defense Minister and the Home Minister then met the Prime Minister where Finance Minister Jaitley, Army Chief were also present
 uske baad pradhanmantri ne raashtrapati se milakar unhen sthiti se avgat karaayaa he
 Media rhetoric about strategic decisions is closed
 kya do din kii baithkon se raksha maamalon ke jaankaar aashwast hai ki bharat ne sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kii he
 Restraint within the government, rather than fidgeting, is a sign of a new strategy or disappointment on all social media camps
 ham 'prime time' main shaheedon kii bhi baat karenge, jinka parthiv sharir unke gaanv ghar pahunchaa to sari daleelein chup ho gayi
 We will talk about what India should have done about Pakistan in the last two years, why what is being done is not enough or is remarkable
 baatcheet se lekar kootneeti sab bekaar he, to kargar kya he
 From the western border of India to Africa, the names may vary, from lashkar-e-taiba to the Taliban and Isis (ISIS), its philosophy is the same, hate, murder and violence
 haalanki isaki chaaya duniya bhar main pad rahi he lekin yah paidaa ho rahaa he bharat ke pados main
 These battles cannot be won by conventional weapons of military, intelligence or diplomacy
 pradhanmantri lagaataar aatankwaad ko protsaahit karne vaale mulk ko alag-thalag karne kii baat har manch se karte aa rahe hai
 Now come to the Defense Minister

 The Prime Minister has been continuously talking about isolating the country that encourages terrorism from every platform
 ab aate hai raksha mantri par
 His constant statements about cross-border terrorism keep coming
 2015 main raksha mantri kaa ek bayaan he ki 2014 kii tulana main is baar 65 se 70 fisadi adhik aatankwaadi maare gaye hai
 They always say that the gun is not for eating but for driving
 yah sawaal mahatvapurn to he ki sena ke base camp par aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kaise kiya
 If India follows a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, then how did the military base after Pathankot get attacked
 yah sawaal aakhir kyon chhod diya ja rahaa he
 Our Director General of Military Operations, DGMO Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh has told that the search operation in Uri has been completed
 aatankwaadiyon se chaar eke 47 rifl, chaar under bairal grenade launture, 39 under bairal grenads, 5 hand grenade, do radio sets, do jeepies, do map shits, do matrix shits baraamad hue

 Russia has canceled a joint military exercise with Pakistan
 china ne bhi kaha he ki vah har tarah ke aatankwaad ke khilaaf he
 The United States and Britain have also condemned, but can the condemnation be called a mobilization against Pakistan
 ninda to har baar hoti he
 The US who killed Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil needs to tell us something new about Pakistan, which has recently submitted documents related to the Pathankot attack to India
 pakistan ke raksha mantri khwaja asif ne kaha he ki hamaari dharti par koi kadam rakhega to ham gurez nahin karenge newclear vepans istamaal karne main
 If any country talks about the use of nuclear weapons and the world does not matter, then on what basis should we believe that the countries of the world are serious about terrorism
 pakistan ko alag-thalag karne main dilchaspee rakhte hai
 India's nuclear doctor says that India will never use it first

 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bijepi netaaon ko naseehat dete hue kaha he ki sirf daliton ke ghar jaakar khaanaa khaane se kuch nahin hoga
 It is being told that in a recent Union meeting in Delhi, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said that instead of going to the house of Dalits, they should also be called to their homes
 baithak main saaf sandesh tha ki dalit prem ekatarfa nahin hona chahie
 Dalit love has to be shown that they will have to go to their home too
 sangh sutron ke mutabik dilli main hui sangh kii baithak main bhagwat ne sawaal kiya ki ashtami par ham dalit samaaj kii kanyaon ko ghar par bulaakar puujate hai, lekin kya apane ghar kii kanyaon ko unke ghar bhejte hai? bhagwat kaa sandesh tha ki aisa samarasata abhiyaan tabhi safal hoga, jab dalit bhi hamaare ghar aaen
 In the last few days, many BJP leaders have reached the house of Dalits
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah se lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath tak dalit ke ghar bhojan kar chuke hai
 Many BJP leaders have also eaten at the homes of Dalits following the footprints of senior leaders
 isamen kai vivaad bhi hue
 Many leaders were accused of having eaten from outside
 yogi ke dalit ke ghar khaanaa khaane ko lekar bhi vivaad hua tha
 It was then said that the bread for Yogi was made by his own minister Swati Singh
 gauratlab he ki swati singh thakur jati se aati hai, jisko lekar basapa ne yogi par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 If Suresh Rana, a minister in the Yogi government, ate food at a Dalit's house, then it was also disputed
 aarope laga ki rana ne hotel se mangakar khaanaa khaaya
 Later Suresh Rana himself clarified that he ate only the food made by the village Dalits
 kendriya mantriuma bharatine to yahaan tak kah diya ki ham bhagwaan ram nahin hai ki daliton ke saath bhojan karenge, to ve pavitra ho jaaenge
 When the Dalits come to our house and sit and dine together, then we will be able to become pure
 dalit ko jab main apane ghar apane haathon se khaanaa parosungi tab meraa ghar dhanya ho jayega
