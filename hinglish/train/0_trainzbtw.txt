 agar railway ke ek vichaaradhin prastaav ko hari jhandi mil gai, to viipi cote ke tahat conform hone vaale rail tikaton par tatkaal cote kii dar se ooncha kiraaya vasula ja saktaa he
 Social activist Chandrashekhar Gaur, a resident of Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh, said that he had complained to the Prime Minister's Office on February 11 regarding confirmed railway tickets under VIP quota
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne unki shikaayat ko railway board ke yatri marketing vibhaag ke kaaryakari nideshak ko bhej diya tha
 a complaint redressal mechanism of the government in an e-mail sent to Gaur on 19 July said, 'your valuable suggestion is appreciated
 haalanki, mukhyalay yaa ucch adhikari (echo) yaa viipi kota ke tahat conform hone vaale rail tikaton par tatkaal cote kii dar se kiraaya vasuulne ke prastaav par pehle hi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he

 Under this quota, no additional fee is also charged from the passenger after the ticket is confirmed
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) madhya pradesh ke neemuch nivasee saamaajik kaaryakarta chandrashekhar goud ne bataaya ki unhone viipi cote ke tahat conform hone vaale rail tikaton ko lekar pradhanmantri karyaalay ko 11 farvari ko shikaayat kii thi
 The Prime Minister's Office sent his complaint to the Executive Director of the passenger marketing department of the Railway Board
 sarkaar ke ek shikaayat nivaaran tantra ne goud ko 19 july ko i-mail ke jariye bheje jawaab main kaha, 'aapke moolyawaan suzav kii prashansa kii jaati he
 However, the proposal to collect the fare at the rate of Tatkal quota is already being considered on confirmed railway tickets under the Headquarters or High Officer (HO) or VIP quota
 'tippaniyan Goud, quoting his complaint sent to the Prime Minister's Office, said that the existing system of confirmation of railway tickets under VIP quota is, however, 'discriminatory'
 lekin agar railway kinhin vajahon se is vyavastha ko khatm nahin kar saktaa, to use aise tikaton par tatkaal cote kii dar se ooncha kiraaya vasuulana chahie
 He said that at present the normal fare is charged on confirmed railway tickets under VIP quota

 ) Rape of minor Dalit girls in Badaun and Bhagana reminds us not only of how horrific sexual violence and ethnic tyranny can be, but also exposes the real face of the governance machinery that protects the accused
 yadi jati pratha aaj hamaare bich phufakaarte daitya kii tarah maujuud he, to hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki is daitya ko jitani khuraaq saamanti soch, hinsak aakraamakata, taqatvar jatiyon kii dabangai or purush pradhan vyavastha se mili he, utana hi sambal police, rajnatik vyavastha or nazren pher lene vaale mukhya dhara ke media se mila he
 The first news i read of the Badaun gang rape, it seemed that the girls hanged themselves
 ’’ usamen badaayun ke police adheekshak atul saxena kaa bayaan tha, ‘‘report se lagata he ki marane se pehle ped se latakaaya gaya yani ladakiyon ne shaayad aatmahatya kii he
 "the scene of this dastardly crime by the police chief in our Tamashbeen society was completely contrary to the truth
" ladakiyon kii gardanon main jab fande kase gaye, tab ve jinda thim
 Yes, we now also know that the police refused to write a missing report, denied the parents of the victim girls the right to get justice and tried their best to shelter the accused
 lekin main is shuruaati report kaa hawala dekar is baat kii taraf ishaara karnaa chaahati hum ki police, khaskar daliton ke saath, kamajoro ke saath hinsa ke maamalon main kisi berukhi se pesh aati he
 When a Dalit is killed, the police always refuse to register an FIR, then when there is pressure from a grassroots organization, instead of imposing Section 302 of murder of Indian Penal Code under Section 174 related to death in suspicious circumstances It registers a case
 uttar bharat se aisi khabaren bhale hi abhi kuch din pehle se milane lagi hon, lekin 15 saal pehle bhi tamilnadu main viduthalaai chiruthigal se bheeshan chitkaar sunai di thi
 In 1999–2000, 19 Dalits were killed in the chidambaram-vriddhachalam area
 inamen 7 mahilaayein thim or un sab ke saath samuhik balaatkaar hua tha
 Yet section 302 of murder was imposed in only 7 cases
 yon hinsa kii kadi se kadi ninda karnaa aasaan he, lekin hamen samajhnaa chahie ki jab tak ham damankaaree jati pratha ko jad se nahin ukhaadenge or jati tathaa sampradayik shaktiyon ke saath taqatvar paraseete sambandh bana chuke shashan ke dhaanche ko chunauti nahin denge tab tak balaatkaar se ladaai main koi kamyaabi hasil nahin kar paaenge
 AIDWA investigation report in the recent incident of Badaun reveals that all the accused are Yadavs and these fresh statements of Mulayam Singh Yadav have made their aggressive spirits and raised that, "boys make mistakes
" ’’ mahilaon ke saath hinsa par jati pratha ke prabhaav ko alag kar paanaa naammumkin he
 Those who do not trust this spontaneous nexus should remember that this demon of the caste system swallows Hindu girls in the name of respect
 hindu jatiyon ke mard apni jati kii mahilaon kii deh ko apni milkiyat samajhate hai (ye mahilaayein sirf apni jati ke mardon se shaadi kar sakati hai or jo apni jati se baahar yaa usase neeche kaa saathi dhundhakar niyam todatii hai to unhen hameshaa sajaa / maut milti he)
 The men of the Hindu caste consider their rights over the bodies of Dalit men (the most brutally exploited working class in the country today) and Dalit women (who are not only exploited as a class but who are also victims of sexual violence)
 balaatkaar, ek mardaana haq he or isiilie yah hindu jati ke mardon ke haath main yuddh kaa khatarnaak hathiyaar ho gaya he
 They resort to sexual harassment and violence to continue the system that continues to dominate them
 jo log jati pratha or balaatkaar kii samskruti ke in donon kaarnon se sahamat hai, unhen bhi is aatank ko jari rakhane main bharat ke shashan tantra kii bhoomika kaa yakeen dilaane ke liye badi mehnat kerani padati he
 Another issue is the lack of toilets, which has been endlessly discussed, at least in Western media
 is maang ke bare main koi do raay nahin ho sakati
 But we should also understand that no matter how bad the condition of sanitation facilities in India is and whether it is necessary to improve it immediately, it cannot be said that due to the construction of toilets, staunch supporters of caste system and hate The rapists worth doing will get rid of their antics
 jab tak unhen yakeen rahegaa ki unhen apni harkaton kaa koi khamiyaja nahin bhugatna padegaa, tab tak ve waar karte rahenge
 Lack of toilet facilities only exposes the demeanor of governance and the move to deliberately kill the poorest people in India
 haryana main bhagaanaa se aae 100 parivaar pichley do maheene se dilli main jantar-mantar par us ghatana kaa virodh kar rahe the, jisamen jaaton ne chaar naaballig dalit ladakiyon ke saath samuhik balaatkaar kiya tha
 On June 4, Delhi Police drove them away from Jantar Mantar
 isse na sirf ve nyaay paane se vanchit hue, balki virodh darj karne kaa unka naitik adhikaar bhi chhin gaya
 This is not the only instance of rape incidents in which Dalits have been denied justice
 1968 main kilovenmani main 44 daliton kii hatya hui thi par madras hycourt ne sabhi aropiyon ko saboot ke abhaav main chhod diya
 The Patna High Court dropped all the accused in the Bathani Tola massacre (killing 21 Dalits in 1996) and the Laxmanpur Bathe massacre (killing 58 Dalits in 1997)
 in sharmnaak faislon kii kadi main taaja misaal 1991 kaa sundar hatyakand he, jisamen do maah pehle andhra pradesh hycourt ne sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya
 Even when Dalits are being deliberately raped, murdered, the courts are giving protection to the criminals due to their caste domination and political contacts rather than justice
 isse pataa chalata he ki jati pratha shashan tantra kii nas-nas main samaai he
 The attitude of the judiciary is also similar to the arrogant policeman of Badaun
 jo aaropee ko salaah detaa he, ‘‘jail main balaatkaariyon ke saath bura saluk hota he lekin hatyaron ko dikkat nahin aati
 Put an end to these girls
 ’’ ye sab, samaaj main jaden jamaai baithi us vyavastha ke ang hai, jo jaateey dabadabe or dabang jatiyon ke aatank failaane ke adhikaar ko manyata detii he
 In this case, once again the same trends have come up
 hamen yaad rakhana hoga ki badaayun or bhagaanaa kii ladkiyaan sirf jati pratha or balaatkaar kii samskruti kii hi nahin, balki is sharmnaak harakat ko shah dene vaale shashan tantra kii bhi shikaar hai
 We also have to remember that if we do not want to be called a rapist nation, then we have to fight against all these forces that keep this stigma alive

 aitihaasik bahumat se jeet darj karne ke baad modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa aaj pehla aam bajet aa rahaa he
 The feature of this time has been revealed even before the budget is presented in Parliament
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman desh ko agle saal ke liye kya dene vaali hai, uske dastavej unhone paramparaagat taur par istemaal kiye jane vaale brifces main nahin rakhe, balki is baar bajet kii patakatha ko makhmali laal kapade se cover kiya gaya he
 In this way the Modi government has also destroyed the old tradition of the British associated with the budget
 bag main bajet kii parampara 1733 main tab shuru hui thi jab british sarkaar ke pradhanmantri or vittamantri robert walpol bajet pesh karne aae the or unke haath main ek chamade kaa thilaa tha
 There were documents related to the budget in this bag itself
 chamade ke is thile ko french bhashaa main bujet kaha jaataa tha, usee ke aadhaar par baad main is prakriya ko bajet kaha jane laga
 The red suitcase was first used in 1860 by British budget chief William Gladstone
 ise baad main gladstone box bhi kaha gaya or lagaataar isi bag main britain kaa bajet pesh hota rahaa
 The bag was officially retired in 2010 after a long period of deterioration
 bharat main ledar bag se shuru hua bajet1947 main angrejon se to bharat ko aazaadee mil gai lekin bajet kii parampara angrejon vaali hi rahi
 The country's first Finance Minister R
 ke shanmukham chetty ne jab 26 janvari 1947 ko pehali baar bajet pesh kiya to vah bhi ek ledar ke thile ke saath sansad pahunche
 After this, the budget continued to be presented with this tradition for many years
 1958 main yah parampara badali or pandit jawahar laal nehru ne kaale rang ke brifces main bajet pesh kiya
 After this, when the then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh presented the budget in 1991, the color of the briefcase was changed to red
 tab se hi laal brifces main bajet pesh kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Even the interim budget of 1 February 2019 was presented by Piyush Goyal in the red briefcase itself
 magar, is baar modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal kaa pehla bajet lekar ain vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke haath main laal brifces kii jagah bajet ke dastavej laal makhmali kapade main lipte najar aae
 This is the first time that both the leather bag and the briefcase have disappeared from the government's budget
 bajet kii is nai parampara ko bahi-khaataa bataaya ja rahaa he
 Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy V
 subramanyam ne kaha he ki yah bhartiya parampara he jo gulaami va pashchim ke vichaaron se bharat kii aazaadee ko pradarshit karti he
 Subramaniam also said that it is not a budget, it is a ledger
 yani french bhashaa ke bujet shabd ke aadhaar par laidar bag or suutakes main pesh kiye jane vaale aarthik khaake ko bajet kaa jo naam diya gaya use ab bahi-khaataa kaha ja rahaa he
 Taking an important decision, Delhi's Kejriwal government has now ordered 50% beds in the capital's largest neuro hospital GB Pant to be reserved for the citizens of Delhi
 dilli ke jibi pant aspataal main ab lagbhag 750 bed sirf dilli ke nagarikon ke ilaaj ke liye rigerv rakhe jaaenge
 Keep in mind, these beds will be able to treat those citizens of Delhi who are referred to GB Pant by referring them to other hospitals of the government
 dilli sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay ne is maamle main ji bi pant aspataal prashasan ko nirdesh jari kar die hai
 The decision taken by the patients coming from other states, GB Pant Hospital of Delhi Government is considered a big hospital for neuro related problems
 is faisle par vivaad uthne ke baad dilli sarkaar ne safai dete hue kaha ki aspataalon main duusare rajyon se aane vaale marijon kii sankhya main betahasha badhotaree hone ke kaaran dilli ke apane nagarikon ko behatar ilaaj or aspataalon main bed se meharoom hona pad rahaa he
 That is why this decision has been taken
 dilli ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain kaa kahana he ki dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon kii haalat sudhaarney or kejariwal sarkaar dwaara dilli ke sarkari aspataalon main sabhi davaaiyaan muft karne kii yojana ke baad padosi rajyon ke marijon ne rajdhani kar rukh kar liya he
 The government says that there has been a huge increase in the number of patients coming from other states, due to which the citizens of Delhi are often unable to get beds or better treatment in Delhi government hospitals
 aise main dilli ke nagarikon ke tex ke paise se chal rahe sarkari aspataalon par sabase pehla haq dilli ke nagarikon kaa he
 Therefore, the government has reserved 50 percent beds at GB Pant Hospital for the treatment of the people of the capital
 dilli sarkaar rajdhani main rahane vaale logon ko nijee aspataalon main bhi muft ilaaj kii suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaati he
 Political controversy may also arise after this decision of Kejriwal government
 vahiin, sarkaar ke sutron kii maane to sarkaar jaldi hi apane tamaam aspataalon main muft main milane vaali sabhi dawaaiyon kii yojana ko sirf dilli ke nagarikon ke liye simit kar sakati he
 However, it has not been decided yet
 kejariwal sarkarnijee aspataalon kii kasegi nakeliske saath hi kejariwal sarkaar dilli vidhansabha ke sheetakaaleen satr main dilli health act laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 For institutions such as hospitals, the Delhi government will be introduced with stringent provisions on the lines of central government legislation
 haalankimax aspataal kaa license raddakarne ke baad dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kai maukon par yah kaha he ki unki sarkaar nijee aspataalon ke khilaaf nahin he or naa hi unke kaamkaaj main roda bananaa chaahati he
 But if government sources are to be believed, the government will bring a new law in the Legislative Assembly to curb the incidents of collection of arbitrary bills from private hospitals

 The three murderers were also bloodied

 But there were traces of blood on all three clothes

 All three murderers were still present in the workshop
 kuch der baad maala kaa naukar use dekhne ke liye workshop main ja pahunchaa
 On seeing him, Rahul and his companions were shocked
 bina samay gavaaye un teenon ne naukar par hamalaa bol diya
 Bahadur was also stabbed with a knife and in a short time the work of the servant was completed
 phir teenon ne naukar kii laash ko bhi bathroom main shift kar diya
 After committing the double murder, the trio left the workshop and reached the main room
 jahaan teenon ne wo sara keemtee saamaan uthaa liya
 Most of that accessories were jewelry
 rahul jaanata tha ki maala apni gaadi kii chaabi kahaan rakhti he
 So he also picked up the key of the car
 iske baad ve teenon ek saath ghar kaa mukhya get kholkar baahar nikle wo bhi maala kii gaadi se
 Wasim was driving the car
 ab unki car sadak par daud rahi thi
 After committing this crime all three reached Rangpur hill
 unhone katl ke dauraan istemaal kiya gaya chaaku or khun se sane apane kapade ek talab main phenk die
 Then they wore the clothes that they had brought with them
 teenon rangpur pahari par hi maujuud the
 Then the three began to realize that they would be caught
 unhen apane gunaah kaa dar sataane laga
 So the three friends decided to go to the police
 teenon vahaan se car lekar nikle or sidhaa thane ja pahunche
 The moment they reached the police station, it was quarter past three
 din or taarikh donon badal chuke the
 There was silence in the police station
 baahar paharedaar tainaat tha or andar duty afasar maujuud tha
 The three reached the officer and told the whole incident
 rahul ne bataaya ki usne apni malkin maala lakhaani or unke naukar kaa katl kar diya he
 Upon hearing her, the first officer felt that all three of them had drunk
 lekin baar-baar poochne par un teenon ek hi baat bataai to afasar sakate main aa gaya
 He immediately called the SHO and called the police station
 rahul or uske saathiyon ne phir puri kahani esechao ko sunai
 The police team reached the spot on the spotlight of the three at night

 Standard SMS Charges Applicable ” Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting to increase the number of judges and increase the retirement age of judges of High Courts to 65 years
 sijeai gogoi ne pradhanmantri se ucchtam nyaayalay or ucch nyaayalayon ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhishon kii kramash: (samvidhan ke) anuchhed 128 or 224 e ke tahat saavadhik niyukti karne kaa bhi anurodh kiya he, taaki barason se lambit pade mukademon kaa nipataara kiya ja sake
 The Chief Justice has said that 58,669 cases are pending in the apex court and this number is increasing as new cases are filed
 unhone kaha ki nyaayadhishon kii kami ke chalate kanoon ke sawaal se jude ahm maamalon par faisla karne ke liye jaruri sankhya main samvidhan peethen gathit nahin kii ja rahi hai
 He wrote, `` You remember that almost three decades ago in 1998, the sanctioned strength of judges in the Supreme Court was increased from 18 to 26 and then two decades later in 2009 it was increased to 31 including the Chief Justice, so that the cases Settlement may be expedited '
 gogoi ne likhaa he, ‘main aapse anurodh karata hum ki kripaya is par sheersh praathamikta ke saath vichaar karen, taaki ucchtam nyaayalay main nyaayadhishon kii sankhya bad sake or yah adhik prabhavi dhang se kaam kar sake kyonki samay par nyaay muhaiyaa karne ke apane antim lakshya ko paane main ise lanbaa safar tay karnaa he
 
 
 '' pradhan nyaayadhish ne ab tak teen patr likhe hai
 He said that the size of the cadre of judges of the High Courts has increased in the past, yet the proportion of judges in the apex court has not increased
 sijeai ne duusare patr main modi se ek samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak laane par vichaar karne ko kaha he, taaki ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon kii sevanivrittiumrabadha kar 62 se 65 saal kii ja sake
 Gogoi has written that one of the main reasons for not being able to stop the progress of pending cases is the lack of judges in the High Court
 philhal, 399 pad yaa nyaayadhishon kii manjuur sankhya kaa 37 pratishat rikt hai
 Existing vacancies need to be filled immediately
 haalanki, sabhi hitdharakon ke sarvshereshth prayaason ke baavjood nyaayadhishon kii manjuur sankhya ke najadik nyaayadhishon kii karyrat sankhya ko laane ke liye nyaayadhishon kii niyukti sambhav nahin rahi he
 The CJI has also written that the retirement age of judges of the High Courts should be increased by three years to 65 years
 isse lambit pade maamalon kii sankhya ghataane main madad milegi
 This would also be in line with the recommendations of the standing committees of Parliament
 gogoi ne yah bhi kaha ki ek nyaayadhish ko viksit hone main vakt lagata he or tab jaakar vah practice ke samrudh anubhav ke aadhaar par navonmeshi vichaaron ko prastut kar paane kii sthiti main hota he
 This situation can be avoided, provided that the retirement age is raised to an appropriate level so that their (judges') deep experience and expertise can be used for a longer period
 unhone likhaa he, ‘‘mere vichaar se bhi, yadi ucch nyaayalay ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhish ko 62 saal se adhikumramen adhikranon main niyukt karne ke liye yogya mana jaataa he to ve log ucch nyaayalayon main bhi 65 saal kii aayu tak seva de sakate hai
 This will ensure availability of more experienced judges in the long run '

 kis yanichumbanpyaar jataane kaa ek tarika he
 What a feeling of love he wakes up, which every lover wants to add
 har vyakti chahta he ki jisase vah pyaar karata he, use kis kare or uskaa premi bhi use kis kare
 Kiss helps them connect emotionally before two people are physically connected
 kis karke hi premi ek-duusare ke prati apana pyaar jataate hai
 Which helps to bring the couple closer and this increases the happiness between the two
 vaise to good morning kis se lekar good nite kis tak or best of lack se lekar badhai dene ke liye bhi log ek-duusare ko kis karte hai
 Although there is no specific or selected time of kiss, but if you do not make Kiss memorable in a special way by adding emotions with emotion, then that kiss will not matter
 
 
 
 So that everyone will have their own special style of kissing, and if you do not have your own style then you will make it slowly
 vaise ye bhi sach he ki kising ke liye koi export maujuud nahin he
 But tie the knot that before you kiss, you need to completely relax
 relax hone ke liye saamaanya rup se saans len
 If you are unable to breathe through your mouth during kissing, try to breathe slowly through your nose and ask your partner to do the same
 lekin dhyaan rakhen ki kising ke dauraan partner ko bich-bich main saans lene kaa samay den, isse aap pyaar ko enjoy karenge
 Another thing about love is to tie the knot that nothing should come between love
 yahi baat kising par bhi lagu hoti he or kising ke dauraan kisi anya cheez ke bare main naa sochen
 one more thing
 
 
 jab kising ke liye donon ke hont mil rahe hon to us samay offis kii meeting, adhure kaam, bos kii daant or tarif har cheez ko bhul jaaen
 Along with this, it is also important that during kissing, only think about kissing, do not fly parrots about it
 excitement or nervasness main jaldbaaji naa karen
 There is no correct way of kissing
 kis karne ke liye apane partner kii gardan ko peeche yaa ek taraf se aaraam se sahalaate hue pakaden
 If you want, you can also hold the partner from the waist during kissing
 kising ke dauraan unke chehre par ungliyaan firaakar aap kis ke liye unhen uttejit kar sakate hai
 You must be aware that the earlobe of women is very sensitive and stimulating
 kaan ke neeche kis karnaa mahilaon ko bahut acha lagata he
 One way of kissing is that while kissing you by the throat, slowly go upwards and gently throw warm air through your mouth in their ears
 ye galtiyaan karne se bachenkising kaa alag hi lutf hota he, lekin dhyaan rakhen ki agar aapke munh se durgandh aati he to yah aapke partner ke liye kisi sajaa se kam nahin hogi
 Take special care of oral hygiene before kissing and for this you can use mouthwash
 apane partner ko aaraam se kis main shaamil karen naa ki apana pishan dikhaane ke liye takat kaa istemaal karen, isse aapke partner ko chot bhi lag sakati he
 Don't kiss for the first time for a very long time, but after a few seconds leave the partner after realizing his kiss
 lekin aapako is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki agar aapkaa partner zyada der tak kis karnaa chahta he to use aisa karne den

 Your 20 saal ke antarrashtriya kariyar main 800 test wicket or 500 se adhik vanade wicket lene vaale is 41-varshiya of spinner ne kaha ki ausat ke maamle main bhale hi sar don breadman kaa jawaab nahin, lekin ranon or lambey samay tak cricket main bane rahane ke maamle main tendulkar ko apane yug kaa mahanatam cricketer mana jayega
 Muralitharan said in an exclusive interview to PTI, "sachin is the greatest cricketer of my era
" vah aadhunik yug kaa mahaan he
 i salute his passion, dedication, hard work before every match and his love for cricket and this makes him the greatest player
 unhone kaha, maine anya ko nahin dekha
 i did not see Don Bradman batting
 yadi aap ausat par gaur karen, to breadman kaa jawaab nahin, lekin yadi aap sachin ke aankade, unhone jitne adhik ran banaae, unka lambey samay tak cricket main bane rahanaa, jo unhen mere samay kaa mahanatam cricketer banaate hai

 Following the attack on the religious leaders of Dera Sachkhand Balan, the situation is becoming increasingly normal in violence-ridden Punjab and neighboring Haryana
 chaar shaharon main karfu main dhilaai ke dauraan halaat shantipurna rahe
 Train services have been restored in the state

 Officials said the curfew was relaxed for three hours in Jalandhar, which witnessed the maximum violence after the killing of a religious leader of Dera Sachkhand Balan in Vienna
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki hoshiyarpur, fagawada or ludhiana main bhi karfu main dheel di gai thi
 He said that curfew remains in Malot town of Muktsar

 Both Congress and BJP parties targeted Arvind Kejriwal
 vipakshi dal ne jahaan unke gaiyr sarkari sanghathan par videshon se sandigdh kosh praapt hone kaa aarope lagaaya, vahiin sattarudh party ne kejariwal or unki team ko congress virdohi takaton kaa mukhauta bataaya
 The party, hurt by Kejriwal's allegations against BJP president Nitin Gadkari, has said that he (kejriwal) is acting at the behest of those who are providing him with funds from abroad
 haalanki saamaajik kaaryakarta ne is aarope ko khaarij kar diya
 Kejriwal has been attacked in the editorial of the latest issue of Congress mouthpiece 'congress Sandesh' and also in the latest issue of BJP mouthpiece 'kamal Sandesh'
 ‘camel sandesh’ main kaha gaya he ki kejariwal ne videshi sroton se ‘supaari’ lee he
 The party has demanded the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government to investigate the matter
 isamen kaha gaya he ki, ‘anna andolan ko vinasht karne ke baad or apni mahatvakanksha jaahir hone ke baad team kejariwal loktantr ke bare main andeh paidaa karne kii sajeesh main shaamil ho gai he or aisa karke ve nishchit taur par un logon ke haathon main khel rahe hai jinka bharat yaa ‘bharat mata’ se koi lagaav nahin he
 Kejriwal had recently accused Gadkari's Purti Group of buying farmers' land from the government at cheap prices and diverting the dam water for irrigation in Vidarbha to his sugar mill
 camel sandesh main kaha gaya he, ‘kejariwal kaa mukhya khel vitt poshan se judaa hua he
 It should be known whether this wealth belongs to India or such forces, which want to make the country weak
 ’ isamen kaha gaya he, ‘jo anna ke prati vafaadaar nahin rah saktaa, vah raashtra ke prati vafaadaar kaise rahegaa
 They are trying to make a hole in democracy with the help of foreign financing and have probably forgotten that democracy is the soul of this country
 ’baharhaal, kejariwal ne in aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki bijepi ko pichley 10 varsh ke vitt poshan ke bare main sthiti spasht kerani chahie
 The editorial alleged that in order to highlight the shortcomings of others, Kejriwal distorted Gadkari's words to earn respect
 vahiin, ‘congress sandesh’ main kejariwal kaa naam liye bagaiyr unke or unki team ke khilaaf jabardast hamalaa karte hue un par sankat paidaa karne vaala or congress virdohi takaton kaa mukhauta hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 The Congress mouthpiece also accused BJP of tarnishing the image of the ruling party
 gauratlab he ki agle maheene nayi party gathit karne kii yojana bana rahe kejariwal ne dlef ke saath bhoomi ke saude ke mudde par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad rabart vadra ko nishaanaa banaaya tha

 Question- The way there have been incessant incursions, there have been 2 terrorist attacks in 15 days, what is the bsf's promptness? Answer - The security forces have been more circumspect

 Today, on the one hand, all actors and actresses remain in the headlines for their hefty fees for doing films, on the other hand, Salman Khan did not charge any fees from Suraj Barjatya for his upcoming film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo'

 Sallu Mian and Sooraj Barjatya are working together after almost a decade and a half through this film

 haalanki sabko ummid yahi he ki film behtareen bijness karegi kyonki yahdiwali par reliseho rahi he or us din box offis par iskaa koi campatishan bhi nahin hoga

 com / obqfqba40k There has been a big disclosure about Pakistan protesting on India's membership in the NCG
 news agency eenai ne khabar di he ki pakistan abhi bhi uttar korea ko parmaanu samragi bech rahaa he
 In spite of this, he himself is strongly engaged in NCG membership
 yahi nahin, bharat kaa virodh karne ke liye use china kaa bhi samarthan mila he
 Quoting American sources, the news agency wrote, "the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission is still supplying banned goods to North Korea in violation of UN sanctions
 yahi nahin, uttar korea ko jo parmaanu saamagree supplai kii ja rahi he usamen vah saamagree bhi shaamil he jo china kii sansthaaon ne PAEC ko di he
 'the North Korean officer, who went to PAK eight times in three years, however, brushed aside these allegations, saying such things are coming to light because of Pakistan's support for NSG membership
 america sutron kaa daawa he ki tehran main uttar korea ke do diplomats kim yong choi or jaing yong san ne 2012 se 2015 ke bich 8 baar pakistan kaa daura kiya tha
 It is said that during his visit, the officials of North Korea had also met the Pakistani officials associated with the nuclear program

 One member did not even protest, membership sources said that Amandeep Singh Gill, senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs and in-charge of Disarmament and International Security Division, is already in Seoul to garner support and explain India's case
 bharat jaise gairenpiti deshonke pravesh par sadasyon ke bante hone ke saath china enesji sadsyta ke bharat ke prayaason main lagaataar roda atka rahaa he
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) operates under the principle of consensus and if any one country votes against India, its attempt to gain membership will fail
 haalanki, samooh ke adhiktar deshon ne bharat kaa samarthan kiya he, lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki china ke saath hi turki, dakshin africa, ireland or newjiland enesji main bharat ke pravesh ke paksh main nahin hai

 There is a famous saying among Amitabh Shrivastavjharkhand's officers that there is no need to come to the office of Chief Minister Raghubar Das
 ek sheersh afasar kehete hai, ''aap apni aprejal report unki nihaayat saaf chamakati mej main, or unki ankhon tathaa chehre ke bhav main dekh sakate hai
 He is not a person to talk around freely or raise blood
 '' ve aise shaks ke taur par jane jate hai jisane apane mukhya sachiv ko mukhyamantri ke faisle par sawaal uthaane ke kuch ghanton ke bheetar rukhsat kar diya tha
 His same clear-cut and non-tolerant attitude remains intact
 janshikayat nivaaran ke masik kaarykram ko 'sidhi baat' yun hi nahin kaha jaataa
 In this the Chief Minister directly hears the complaints of the people and 1
 70 lakh logon ko iskaa phayda pahunch chukaa he
 Really, you will not find a single paper on the large table of Raghubar Das
 yah har vakt itani saaf or chamakdaar rahati he ki aap isamen dekhakar apane bal sanvaar sakate hai
 Das sits on his chair covered with white towels in his spacious office on the first floor of the project building, the building of the State Secretariat, his Samsung mobile phone in silent mode, reading glasses in a yellow case, and a computer screen silent
 ve tanaav mukt najar aate hai, baavjood iske ki mahaj ek maheene baad unhen chunaav kaa saamana karnaa he
 Raghubar Das told India Today, "the people of Jharkhand have expressed tremendous faith in the right of BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 main ummid karata hum ki ab ve mujhe bhi meri mazdooree denge
 i have worked tirelessly for the last five years, now it is their turn to give us our rights
 ''majboot paaydaan parajharkhand main loksabhaa kii 14 main se 12 siten—or 51 fisadi vot, jo pehle kabhi kisi gathbandhan ko nahin mili—bhaajapa kii aguai main endie kii jholii main daalane ke baad raghubar das maanate hai ki in nateezon ne vidhansabha chunaav kaa rukh pehle hi tay kar diya he
 After circling the entire state in his 'johar Jan Ashirwad Yatra' —which he claims has received a "very good ground response" —das appears confident of repeating the Lok Sabha election results
 haalanki, ve kitne bhi purasukun najar aate hon, chunaav main unka bahut kuch daanv par laga he
 He is not only the first non-tribal chief minister of Jharkhand — a state with a Scheduled Tribe population of more than 26 percent — but also the first chief minister to complete a five-year term
 kuch chunautiyaan bhi hai
 a senior BJP leader says that we have told the organization not to take the election lightly in any way
 2014 main bhi bhaajapa ne jharkhand main loksabhaa kii 12 siten jiti thim, magar kuch hi maheenon baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main vah kisi tarah bas saadhaaran bahumat juta pai thi
 The good news for Chief Minister Das is that the Bharatiya Janata Party has traditionally been a big success in Jharkhand
 rajya banane ke baad hue teenon chunaavon main bhagava party har baar sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 In 2005, the BJP won 30 of the 81 seats
 2009 main uski siten ghatakar 18 par aa gayi, par tab bhi jharkhand mukti morche ke saath use sabase badi party kaa darja hasil tha
 In 2014, the party won 37 seats
 raghubar das maanate hai ki 2019 kaa vidhansabha chunaav unhen or bhi behatar nattejey degaa
 At the last time when the assembly elections were held in November 2014, Das was not the bjp's chief ministerial candidate
 teen baar mukhyamantri rah chuke arjuna munda ko, haalanki ghoshit to nahin kiya gaya tha, par tab mukhyamantri pad ke liye saaf pasand mana ja rahaa tha
 But Das came out in hiding when the BJP decided to hand over the reins of the state to a non-tribal leader after Arjun Munda's surprise defeat in the assembly elections
 ab paanch saal baad bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv chunaav kii tarikhon ko elaan hone se pehle hi rajya kii sabase oonchi kursi ke liye das kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Addressing a public meeting on 12 September in Ranchi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi credited Das for the transparent government and public welfare administration
 kendriya grih mantri amit shah bhi das kii 'johaar jan aashirwad yatra' ke liye 18 sitambar ko jharkhand aae the
 In Ranchi, Shah announced that with the Modi government at the center and the Das government in Jharkhand, the state would get the benefit of double engine governments, which would make Jharkhand even better
 ise das ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii tarah dekha gaya
 "in the Lok Sabha elections, the people of Jharkhand gave 12 out of 14 seats to the Modi government, a testimony to the fact that people will again support the Das government," Shah said
 '' sanghathan kii qamar kasne ke liye bhaajapa ke kaaryakari adhyaksh je
 P
 nadda bhi teen baar jharkhand aa chuke hai
 BJP leaders believe that when the Modi government has made Arjun Munda - who could be a challenge to Das - already a minister at the Center
 lihaaja ab mukhyamantri ko lekar andeh nahin rah gaya he
 The scattered opposition Congress, along with two regional parties - JMM and JVM - is once again building a strong opposition in Jharkhand
 unki chauthi saajhedaar party lalu prasad kii argedy he, jiskaa vidhansabha main ek bhi vidhayak nahin he
 The opposition in Jharkhand seems to be in complete disarray, except for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) acting president Hemant Soren, who has completed his transformation journey
 vah bhi tab jab rajya disambar main nai vidhansabha chunane ja rahaa he
 In August, two months after the disastrous results of the Lok Sabha elections, state Congress President Ajay Kumar joined the Aam Aadmi Party by saying goodbye to the party
 congress ne jharkhand main loksabhaa kii saat siton par chunaav ladaa or keval ek jeet saki
 JMM too won just one seat in the Lok Sabha and suffered a dismal defeat for party president Shibu Soren, who had once lost the election to his stronghold Dumka
 jeviem ke adhyaksh babulal marandi apane garh koderma se 4
 More than 55 lakhs were defeated by a huge margin of votes
 tab se vipaksh ko ummid kii koi kiran dikhaai nahin di he
 Babulal Marandi's JVM lost its seventh MLA Prakash Ram on 6 October, who joined the saffron party
 party ne 2014 main vidhansabha kii aath siten jiti thim, jinamein se saat paala badalakar bhaajapa main ja chuke hai
 The opposition believes that in the Lok Sabha elections, there was a vote in favor of Modi and to the extent that JMM also lost some tribal votes
 use ummid he ki vidhansabha chunaav main jeemem or jeviem jaise kshetreey dalon kii kahin zyada suni jaaegi
 However, the Opposition may have to bear the brunt that the decision on the seat sharing has not been done in the three parties
 pichhali baar samjhauta hua tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress or vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan kii aguai jeemem karegi
 The new state Congress president Rameshwar Oraon has shown reluctance to hand over the command of the assembly election campaign to JMM
 isse hemanth sorain ke maathe par bal pad gaye hai
 However JMM is expected to come with the Congress
 kaha jaataa he ki jharkhand main vipaksh jin ranneetiyon par kaam kar rahaa he, unamem se raghubar das ke gaiyr-adivasee hone ko purajor dhang se saamne rakhana he
 The leaders of the three major opposition parties of Congress, Congress, JMM and JVM in Jharkhand are tribal
 jharkhand main vidhansabha kii ek-tihaai se zyada siten, 81 main se 28, anusuchit janajatiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 26 of Scheduled Castes in the state
 3 fisad aabaadi he, jise vipaksh bhaajapa se chhinane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 But it is a matter of leisure for Das that the BJP has not been weak in reserved seats
 2014 main use in 28 main se 11 siten mili thim
 Das also has a record of his work to gain the support of the tribal community
 mukhyamantri kehete hai, ''hamane adivasee upyojna kii rakam badhaakar 20,764 karod rupye kar di
 In 2014 it was just Rs 11,997 crore
 adivasee samskruti ko badhaava dene, uski raksha or sangrakshan karne ke liye hamaari sarkaar ne paaramparik adivasee gram pramukhon ko maandey dena shuru kiya
 We have a long list of steps taken in favor of tribals
 ''jharkhand sanyog se chaar mukhya adivasee samudaayon—santhal, munda, ho or uraanv—kaa ghar he
 While the BJP is traditionally known as a party with a hold on Munda votes, the JMM has a strong presence in the Santali votes, while the Congress is in the bag and the support of Oraon vote banks
 paanch saal pehle bhaajapa ne pichhadi jati taili se aane vaale raghubar das ko jharkhand kaa pehla gaiyr-adivasee mukhyamantri banaaya tha, to yah taadaad main khaase pichde varg ke gaiyr-yadav voton ko jeetne kii uski ranneeti kaa hissaa tha
 Munda tribal votes are already with the BJP, so the party's strategy is to combine non-muslim, non-tribal votes on the strength of Das's OBC leader
 loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ko raghubar das vidhansabha chunaavon main dohraane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Raghubar Das, who has won 12 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats and 51 percent of the vote, feels that the assembly elections have already been decided

 Manjit further says, "when an MLA, MP, Minister, Judge of the High Court Supreme Court, the members of the Commissions, the Government is still giving old guaranteed pension to those who come for short term service then the paramilitary forces who are martyred for the country And why not government employees serving for 30 - 35 years? ”it is worth mentioning that since January 1, 2004, the Central Government and then other states (except West Bengal) have done official work New pension scheme (NPS) based on stock market was started by eliminating the old guaranteed pension system for girls
 nai pension vyavastha kaa virodh karne vaale karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki aaj 15 saal biit jane ke baavjood enpies karmchaariyon kii sevanivritti hone par na to saamaajik suraksha kii garanti tay ho paayi he jabaki prayek karmchaaree ke vetan kaa 24% (10%karmchaaree+14%sarkaar) har maheene pension ke naam par companiyon me niveshit kiya ja rahaa he or na hi sevakaal ke dauraan karmchaaree kii mrityu ho jane par paariwarik pension kii upyukt vyavastha hi kii gayi he
 The issue of old pension restoration during the elections catches demand and political parties also do not miss promises

 satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke shuruaati daur main baraak obama taaja hawa ke jhonke kii tarah maaloom pad rahe the
 a wind that has the potential to improve the condition and direction of America and the whole world
 unhone jo naaraa buland kiya, duniyabar main uski pratidhwani sunai padi
 Millions of people agreed to speak in their own voice - 'yes, we can do that
 ' lekin sarkaar mahaj aashaaon or suhaani hawaaon se nahin chalaa karti hai
 In the two years of Barack Obama's leadership, the United States and the world have now come to understand that having only a skilled speaker is not a guarantee of a better President
 baraak obama 6 november ko mumbai kii dharti par kadam rakh rahe hai
 This is completely different from the image of Obama, who took the oath of office in the presence of millions of people in Washington, Pennsylvania
 yahaan tak ki duniya ke baaki hisse main ise bhaymishrit vismay ke saath dekha gaya
 He was strongly welcomed in his country in the initial period of power
 unhen aashaa kii kiran or parivartan kaa agradoot tak maan liya gaya
 By the time nearly half of his tenure has passed, Obama did make elaborate speeches, but he found that it is difficult to really change
 kahiraa vishvavidhyalay main bhaashan karte hue unhone kaha, 'hamen kya mil rahaa he, isapar gaur karne kii tulana main dusron par dosha madhnaa zyada aasaan he
 Compared to the things that we are getting shared, it is easier to see who is getting different
 phir bhi hamen sahi raste kaa chunaav karnaa chahie, na ki sugam raste kaa
 There is also a rule, which exists in the soul of every religion - we get the same from others in return, as we do with others
 'baraak obama khud kai maukon par sahi raah chunane kii bajaae aasaan rasta chunane ke doshi hai
 The decision not to visit Amritsar in the end is influenced by domestic politics
 iske peeche yah bhay kaam kar rahaa tha ki agar obama amritsar jaakar apane sir par ek aisa vastra dhaaran karte hai, jise pahanane vaale andeh bhari najaron se dekhe jate hon, to isse unki chhavi kharaab hogi
 For this reason, Obama's assistants came to the conclusion that Obama's visit to the Golden Temple was risky
 pev research centre ne haalia adhyayan main paaya he ki 6 main se 1 america yah yakeen karata he ki obama muslim hai
 The fear of his image being tarnished is further reinforced by this fact
 obama ko vah vaada puraa karnaa chahie tha, jo unhone kahiraa main kiya tha
 He should have presented an example in front of others that just wearing a cap on the body or having a visit to another shrine does not undermine your own faith at all
 lekin unhone sahi rasta chunane kii bajaae aasaan rasta chunanaa hi pasand kiya
 There are enough reasons behind Obama's upset
 bloomberg neshnal opinian pole ke mutabik, obama ko vot dene vaale prayek 10 main se 4 log unhen lambey samay tak samarthan dene ke mood main nahin hai
 The road ahead seems difficult for Obama
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki obama bharat kii sansad ke sanyukt satr main puri garmjoshi ke saath bhaashan karenge
 But the basic question is whether Obama's visit will be merely symbolic or will be able to go beyond this scope
 obama bharat ko lekar kitne sanjeeda hai, is baat kii pariksha to tab hogi, jab ve sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main bharat kii sthai sadsyta par apana rukh spasht karenge
 Obama should show that the strategic partnership between India and the US is not merely a conspiracy and the US President is ready to give momentum to this relationship
 america rajdoot bhartiya press se mukhaatib hote samay is baat kii purajor koshish kiya karte hai ki obama ke daure se zyada ummiden na lagaai jaaen
 If there is little hope, then there is little scope for disappointment
 jaraa gaur kiijie, obama ne jab satta sanbhali thi, to unase ummiden bahut zyada thim
 No matter how many attempts he has made to meet those expectations, he does not appear to be fulfilling them

 The controversy over Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film 'padmavati' was called a political drama by Raveena Tandon
 ravina ne kaha ki itihaas kii sachai dikhaane main koi buraai nahin he
 Raveena was giving her views in the 'desh ka Cinema Kaisa Ho' session on the second day in the sixth edition of 'agenda Aaj Tak', the great platform of India's number one news channel 'aaj Tak'
 hindi main he to down market hehistorical filmon par itnaa vivaad kyon hota he puche jane par ravina kaa kahana tha ki ham jati, dharm yaa phir yun kahen ki ek limit main rah kar chizon kyon karte hai
 If i call the washerman a washerman, then what is evil
 aksar filmon main aise hi samudaay yaa samaaj ko lekar mudde banaae jate hai
 i am an actress, Abar has called it an actress in Hindi, so what is evil
 hindi ko lekar ham down market ho jate hai ki hindi main thodaa acha nahin lagata
 Controversy over Padmavati only due to election, Raveena said - after 1 month everything will be alright
 What are you showing? On the question of showing the bad side of our films, fearless history, Raveena said, 'if you watch digital, you will know how to show the truth there
 isamen hinsa he, sex he raajnneeti he, vah sabakuch he jo itihaas main he
 But when we show one aspect of history, 'jauhar' (in Padmavati), intellectuals say that you are glorifying it
 agar aap sati par film banane jaae to log kahenge ki mahimamandit kar rahe hai
 Whereas what used to happen in those days, you just want to show it
 ham ye chaahate hai ki hamaari filmein nidar hon
 The filmmaker also said sensing Virena, "we are as sensitive as politicians
 aap new india kii baat karte hai, 21veen shatabdi kii baat karte hai, ham abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii baat karte hai
 But where is the line that you want to draw
 ' ravina ne kaha, 'padmavati kaa virodh galat he
 Johar is not glorified in the film
 us jamaane main kya hota tha ise dikhalaane kii koshish kii gai he
 As far as the matter is concerned, our king-maharaja did not wash any milk
 wo koi ganga snaan nahin karke aate the
 'the film industry is the best example of secularism in the country, Raveena said,' i can say by thumping that our industry which was before and what it is today is the best example of secularism in the country
 main yahaan kaam karti hum
 My father and husband also work here
 main bataanaa chaahuungi ki puri industry ek saath he
 'people are getting scared,' said Jajnarkarveena, 'the question is why the people who threatened them were not arrested? a film (padmavati) is being opposed
 bain kii maang ho rahi he
 Somebody is threatening to go beyond the statute and the constitution
 ye kaise ho rahaa he? unhone sonu nigam ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di, bhansaali ko dhamkee di, deepika ko maarane kii dhamkee di, aisa hone kyon diya ja rahaa he? sahamat hum ki aap virodh kar rahe hai or aapako iskaa adhikaar he
 But the Healthy Protest can be accepted
 is tarah kii hinsa ko nahin
 'governments keep changing, but not the circumstances of women: Raveena Tandonjohar was the helplessness of women to protect themselves
 Speaking on Padmavati, Raveena said that Johar is not glorified in the film

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii ladaai main congress kaa aatiaatmavishvaas use le duba
 In Karnataka, relying too much on the Congress CM candidate Siddaramaiah proved to be harmful
 siddharmaiya ke chalate hi rajya main jedies or basapa ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan main nahin utari
 While many opposition party leaders kept advising the Congress to form an alliance with the JDS, the party high command only listened to Siddaramaiah
 isi kaa nateeja he ki karnataka main akale chalanaa congress ko mahangaa padaa
 In Karnataka, the Congress entered the electoral arena on its own
 rajya kii sabhi vidhansabha siton par party ne apane ummidavaar utaare the
 While JDS and BSP entered the electoral fray in alliance
 vahiin bijepi apane puraane netaaon ko saath laakar chunaav lard rahi thi
 From BS Yeddyurappa and Sriramulu to the Reddy brothers stood together in the BJP camp
 isi kaa khamiyaja congress ko bhugatna padaa he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that if the Congress had aligned with the JDS, the election results would have been different
 bataa den ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhi mamata banerjee ne donon ko gathbandhan karne kii salaah di thi
 But this time the Congress did not agree
 karnataka main congress ko jedies or basapa ke saath gathbandhan na karnaa manhagaa padaa he
 Karnataka has 19 per cent Dalit voters
 jabaki jedies kaa mul votbank vokkaliga samudaay kul matadaataaon kaa kareeb 13 fisadi he
 JDS leader Deve Gowda belongs to this community
 congress kaa jedies ke saath gathbandhan na karne ke chalate in donon votbainkon main bikharaav hua, jabaki vahiin bijepi kaa mul votbank ekamusth rahaa, jisamen kisi tarah kii koi sendhamari nahin ho saki
 If the Congress, JDS and BSP came together in the electoral battle in Karnataka, the results would have been different
 is baat ko is udaahaaran se samaj sakate hai ki basapa se gathbandhan kaa phayda kumaraswami kii party jedies ko mila
 The increase of seats in JDS beyond expectations is an indication that the Congress has not received the Dalit votes
 jedies ke saath gaya he
 This means that the Congress has made a big mistake by not making an alliance
 karnataka main congress ummidavaar kai siton par bahut kam voton se peeche rahe
 Even in Karnataka, the Congress has not contested the elections with JDS in front of Siddaramaiah's insistence
 jabaki baaki rajyon main party ke sheersh netritv ke faisle rahe honge
 For the defeat of the Congress, the party has to bear the brunt of electoral management and not setting the equation somewhere
 congress ne jedies par aarope lagaaya ki vah bijepi kii bi team ke taur par chunavi maidan main he
 The reason for this is that in many seats, both parties fielded light candidates against each other's candidates
 congress is tarah ke chunavi sameekaran set nahin kar saki
 The Congress had made a similar mistake in Tripura
 vahaan left ke saath gathbandhan karke chunavi maidan main utar sakati thi
 But she could not do it
 aisa hi faisla upi ke upachunaav main bhi party ne kiya or iskaa hashr kya hua he, vah sabake saamne he
 If the Congress continues on the path of Ekla Chalo, then one state after another will leave its hands
 congress ko isi ekala chalo kii niti ke chalate pehle tripura main haar jhelni padi or ab karnataka main

 '' The century superstar Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of a warrior who is on an indefinite hunger strike in the war against corruption in Prakash Jha's film 'satyagraha'
 is drishy main jaan daalane ke liye amitabh ne sachmuch khaanaa chhod diya tha, lekin jha ke 61wein janmdin par unhone apana anshan sthagit kar diya
 The 70-year-old megastar is in Bhopal these days and is busy shooting for 'satyagraha'
 sutron ne bataaya ki kirdaar ke saath nyaay karne ke liye amitabh ne apni aisi haalat bana lee thi ki unke munh se aawaaj bhi nahin nikalati thi
 On February 27, Amitabh's fast came to an abrupt halt when Prakash celebrated his 61st birthday in the film Unit
 yah sab kuch bhopal ke ramlila maidan main hua
 Jha was filming a scene here of a huge general in which Amitabh is on a hunger strike like Anna Hazare
 yahaan maidan main vaadakon kaa ek dal bhi shooting ke liye maujuud tha
 Then all the work was suddenly stopped
 film ke sabhi kalakaar- amitabh bachchan, ajay devgan, karina kapur, manoj vaajapeyi or arjuna rampal ek sur main film ke nirdeshak kii shaan main 'happy berthde tu you' gane lage
 Recalling this remarkable moment, Prakash Jha says, 'we were filming the crucial scene of the rally
 sabhi kalakaaron ke saath vaadakon kaa dal bhi vahaan maujuud tha
 Everyone suddenly started speaking 'happy Birthday'
 maine haalanki kisi ko apane janmdin ke bare main nahin bataaya tha
 He added, 'I am not a birthday celebrant
 maine to apana janmdin apane ladakpan main bhi nahin manaaya
 That is why on Wednesday i was a little nervous at first, but shortly after, i was extremely moved
 roj aap bachchan ko happy berthde gaate nahin sun sakate wo bhi saaj-baj ke saath
 Incidentally, in this film, Amitabh Bachchan is playing the role of a war fighter who is very similar to the elderly social activist Anna Hazare
 vah ghode par sarapat daudta he, 360 degree uchhalkar apni talwaar ko laharaata he, ek laat se diwaar gira detaa he
 He is not just a hero nor a superhero, he is the only and only superstar Rajinikanth who has played the lead roles in the Tamil film 'kochadaiyaan'

 Sisodia, who is also the Education Minister of Delhi, reprimanded the private schools being run on DDA land, as these schools had approached the court against the new guidelines for nursery admission
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne jo nae niyam banaae hai, vah supreme court ke varsh 2004 main aae aadesh ke mutabik hai
 Last year, the AAP government released a list of 51 canceled criteria, including parents' education, their occupation, age, oral examination and interview

 Pakistan had said that it would not do any favors in the action against terrorist networks and in bringing the Pathankot attack conspirators to justice
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ke mutabik,pathankot vayusena stesan par hamale kii sajishrachane or use anjaam dene kaa kaam pakistan main maujuud sanghathanon or logon dwaara kiya gaya he
 a senior US State Department official said that Pakistan should no longer make hollow excuses to protect them, as it had made during the Mumbai terror attack
 asainya sarkaar ke paas he maukeydhikari ne kaha, 'unhone 'pakistan' ne saarvajanik taur par kaha he ki ve jaanch karenge
 He has publicly stated that he is not going to differentiate between terrorist organizations
 ham un shabdon par karrwai hote dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The official also indicated that the US wants to give the civilian government time and opportunity to act in accordance with its words

" lekin nishchit taur par ham chaahate hai ki ham sajeeshkartaaon ko jald se jald jimmedaar tehraae jate hue dekhen
 The officer also expressed satisfaction with the response from Nawaz Sharif Sircar within a few days of the attack

 We have to accept their point
 unhone kaha he ki ve jaanch karenge
 Let them do it
 ' america sarkaar ke varisht adhikari pathankot vayusena stesan or afghanistan ke majaar-e-sharif main hue hamalon ke baadpakistani samakakshonke kareebi sampark main hai or unase sahi kadam uthaane kii apil kar rahe hai
 If Pakistan takes such appropriate action, it will not only be a way of building trust, it will also help in improving relations with India
 pathankot hamale ke baad america saansadon ke bich bharat ke liye dikhaai dete samarthan kaa sandarbh dete hue adhikariyon ne sanket diya ki yadi pakistan in aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi thos kadam nahin uthaata he to pakistan ko koi nai sainya madad uplabdh karaane ke liye congress ko raji karnaa obama prashasan ke liye mushkil ho jayega
 Pakistan official said, "we know that this is a challenging time
" yah ek jatil sambandh he
 We do not agree on everything with Pakistan
 ham kathani ko kerani main badalte dekhnaa chaahate hai
 According to officials, if Islamabad ignores action against these terrorist organizations, it will be very difficult for the US government to persuade the Congress with Republican control over the approval to sell eight F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki republican or democratic party ke 20 se zyada saansad bharat ke samarthan main aae hai

 com / tnbut5pdmi Actress Deepika Padukone's two films so far this year, 'race 2' and 'yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' have done a business of 100 crores, but this actress does not give much importance to the 100 crores club
 is saal deepika ko ‘res-2’ kii box offis par safalataa ne utsahit kar diya
 Recently her 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' with old friend Ranbir Kapoor came and proved to be a box office hit
 ‘ye javaani he divaani’ to relies ke shuruaati saptaah main hi 100 karod rupee kaa aankada paar karne vaali pehali film ban gai
 Deepika said in an interview, it feels good when your films work well and it gets appreciation
 yah ek bonus kii tarah hota he
 i want to focus on my work constantly and do good work
 lekin agar koi film acchhee nahin he, par vah acchhee kamai karti he to kya hoga
 
 mujhe lagata he ki sabhi acchhee filmon ko chalanaa chahie
 Recently, masala films are doing more than Rs 100 crore business
 lekin deepika ko lagata he ki film kii safalataa kaa shrey kisi ek shrenee ko dena sahi nahin he
 He said, 'when films like' Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani 'and' Barfi 'go on or other films do business, it feels good
 film kii safalataa ko kisi shrenee main nahin baandha ja saktaa jaise ki yah ection film he yaa yah masala film he isiilie yah acha kaam karti hai
 All good films will do good business
 deepika kii pichhali teen filmein ‘cocktail’, ‘res 2’ or ‘ye javaani he divaani’ ne kaarobaar to acha kiya he ,lekin deepika ne is ore dhyaan nahin diya
 He said, i do not analyze films
 jab darshak meri filmein pasand karte hai to mujhe bahut acha lagata he
 Usually, when an artist is established, he selects films very carefully, but Deepika's thinking is a bit different
 unhone kaha, jis film se main romanchit mahasoos karti hum, main usee main kaam karti hum
 i do the same film for which i think i would love to do it
 deepika ne shahrukh khan ke saath ‘om shanti om’ se bollywood main shuruyaat kii thi
 The film was a superhit
 iske baad unhone ‘bachanaa i haseenon’, ‘chandani chowk tu china’, ‘lav aaj kal’, ‘housephul’, ‘karthik kaling karthik’, ‘khelen ham ji jaan se’, ‘aarakshan’, ‘cocktail’, ‘res 2’, ‘ye javaani he divaani’ main kaam kiya
 Most of these films did well at the box office
 tippaniyan About her journey in the film industry, the 27-year-old actress said that she learned a lot here and the process is still going on
 unki aane vaali film rohit shetty kii ‘chennai express’ he or saal ke aakhir tak vah sanjay lila bhansaali kii ‘ram lila’ main najar aaengi
 This year, Deepika was cheered by the box office success of 'race-2'
 haal hi main puraane dost ranbir kapur ke saath unki ‘ye javaani he divaani’ ai or box offis par hit sabit hui
 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' became the first film to cross the Rs 100 crore mark in its opening week
 deepika ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, jab aapaki filmein acha kaam karti hai or ise saraahna milti he to acha lagata he
 It is like a bonus
 main apane kaam par lagaataar dhyaan dena chaahati hum or acha kaam karnaa chaahati hum
 But what if a film is not good, but it earns well? 
 i think all good films should go on
 haal main masala filmein 100 karod rupee se adhik kaa kaarobaar kar rahi hai
 But Deepika feels that it is not right to attribute the success of the film to any one category
 unhone kaha, ‘jab ‘ye javaani he divaani’ or ‘barfi’ jaisi film chalati he yaa anya filmein kaarobaar acha karti hai to acha lagata he
 The success of the film cannot be tied to any category like it is an action film or it is a masala film, hence it works well
 sabhi acchhee filmein acha kaarobaar karengi
 Deepika's last three films 'cocktail', 'race 2' and 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' have done well, but Deepika did not pay attention to this
 unhone kaha, main filmon ke bare main vishleshan nahin karti
 i love it when the audience likes my movies
 aamtaur par jab koi kalakaar sthapit ho jaataa he to vah filmon kaa chayan bahut soch-samaj kar karata he, lekin deepika kii soch thodi alag he
 She said, i work in the film that i feel thrilled
 main vahi film karti hum, jiske liye mujhe lage ki yah karne par mujhe acha lagegaa
 Deepika made her Bollywood debut with 'om Shanti Om' with Shah Rukh Khan
 yah film superhit rahi thi
 After this, he played 'bachna Ae Haseeno', 'chandni Chowk to China', 'love Aaj Kal', 'housefull', 'karthik Kalinga Karthik', 'khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se', 'reservation', 'cocktail', 'race 2 ', worked in' Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani '
 inamen se zyaadaatar filmein box offis par thik raheen
 The comments film udyog main apane safar ke bare main 27 varshiya is abhinetri ne kaha ki usne yahaan bahut kuch siikhaa or yah prakriya abhi jari he
 Her upcoming film is Rohit Shetty's 'chennai Express' and by the end of the year she will be seen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'ram Leela'
 deepika ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, jab aapaki filmein acha kaam karti hai or ise saraahna milti he to acha lagata he
 It is like a bonus
 main apane kaam par lagaataar dhyaan dena chaahati hum or acha kaam karnaa chaahati hum

 vaani Afreen is no more
 ek hafte tak vah jindagi ke liye sangharsh karti rahi
 For a moment, she felt that she would win this battle
 lekin ek sunaharaa bhram jaise tut jane ke liye hi tha
 Afreen finally succumbed at a hospital in Bangalore
 koun thi baby aapreen? kahaan se ai thi? kahaan chali gai? teen maheene kii nanhee-si jaan, jise uske pita ne badi berahami se maaraa tha
 There were painful marks of beating and burning on the innocent body
 aakhir yah kis aparaadh kii sajaa thi? aapreen kii galati kya thi?galatiyon kii fehrist bahut lambii he
 The list of officers is also no less long
 bangaloru ke ek maamuli badhai 22 varshiya farrukh or 19 saal kii reshma banu ke ghar paidaa hui aapreen kii galati yah thi ki vah ladkaa banakar paidaa nahin hui or uske pita ko is desh ke adhikansh mardon kii tarah hi ladke kii chahat thi
 Her mistake was also that she was born in a very bright-looking, but extremely backward and feudal country of the Third World, where the number of crimes against young girls and women is still high today
 in galatiyon kii jo sajaa usne chukaai, use dekhakar- sunakar pataa nahin, is aaazaad or raushankhyaal mulk main kisi kii raaton kii neend tabah hoti bhi he yaa nahin?haalanki puraa desh matam main duba-sa jaan pad rahaa he

 unicef kii hi report yah bhi kahati he ki bharat main gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se ling pareekshan or garbhpaat kaa kaam 1000 karod ru
 Has transformed into a big industry
 kya baby aapreen khushkismat thi, jo paidaa hone se pehle hi ling pareekshan karwaakar nahin maar daali gai? kya hua, jo vah paidaa ho bhi gai? kya koi guarantee thi ki ladki banakar paidaa hui to is tarah teen maah kii umr main peetane or jalaae jane se nahin maregi? or jo is tarah nahin bhi marati to kya guarantee ki kabhi sadak chalate, sunsaan andhere kone main uske saath rape na ho jaataa or use markar phenk na diya jaataa? badi hoti aapreen ke saath kabhi ghar kaa koi purush rishtedaar sharmnaak harakat na karata?kabhi sadak chalate ladki hone ke kaaran use chhedaa na jaataa? kabhi koi purush prem prastaav thukaraane yaa talaak maangane par uske munh par tejaab na phenk detaa? kabhi koi dalal agava kar use kamathipura yaa jibi road ke kothon main nahin bech detaa? kya guarantee ki kabhi use dahej ke liye jalaakar maar na daalaa jaataa? pati sharaab pikar peethta nahin? or ek din aise hi uske pet ke bachche kaa ling pareekshan na karavaaya jaataa or jo beti hoti to paidaa hone se pehle hi use maar na daalaa jaataa?kya guarantee he? koi guarantee nahin kyonki duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr aazaadee ke 64 saal baad bhi aisi koi guarantee nahin detaa he

 Due to the strike of MCD employees, there has been an outcry over garbage in the national capital Delhi, while the 'swachh Delhi' App of the Delhi government, which was launched keeping in mind the cleanliness, has also flopped on one occasion
 gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar ne do maheene pehle hi 22 november ko yah mobile App launch kiya tha, jiske jariye logon sekoode kii tasveerbhejane ko kaha gaya tha
 It is also interesting to note that in the initial days of launching, where the government was getting close to 4 thousand pictures every day through this app, now this figure is hardly even crossing 100
 bataa den ki bakaayaa vetan ko lekar emsidi karmiyon kii hadtaal par jahaan nigam or rajya sarkaar main tanatani jari he, vahiin guuruuvaar ko pradarshan karte hue karmchaariyon ne rajya ke dipti siem manish sisodiya ke daftar ke baahar bhi kooda phenk diya tha
 The MCD employees have announced an indefinite strike from February 1, if they do not agree to the demands on the fund
 kendriya mantri bhi the lonching main maujuudpradhanmantri narendra modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jab beete saal november main App launch kiya ja rahaa tha, tab kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu, dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ke saath hi teenon nagar nigam ke meyar tak maujuud the
 Then it was also talked that all the agencies would take care of the cleanliness of Delhi together
 lekin jaise-jaise samay beetaa, na sirf emsidi or sarkaar ke rishte badal gaye balki is aplicoshan par aane vaale tasveeron kii sankhya bhi kam hoti chali gai
 If two employees are running App sources, then first, where a team of 6 people was formed in the Urban Development Department of Delhi Government to run this 'clean Delhi' App, now due to less work, only two employees run it Have been
 App ke flop hone ke peeche iske prachaar prasar main kami ko bhi bada kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 Initially, the state government paid a lot of attention to it, but its ads were missing only after a few days of launching

 The government says that they were sent to different municipal corporations to act on them
 daawa yah bhi he ki inamen se 42 hajaar 549 shikayaton par ab tak karrwai kar lee gai he, jabaki 6753 shikaayatein aisi hai jin par karrwai nahin hui
 Not only this, 9179 pictures came in which people uploaded some other picture instead of garbage
 in bade aankadon ke bich ek mjedaar aankada yah bhi he ki pichley kuch dinon se App par 60 se lekar dedh sau shikaayatein hi ai hai

 centre sarkaar kii avaidh boojadkhaanon or gaayon kii avaidh taskari par sakhti ke baad sabase bada sawaal ye he ki bachaai gai gaayon kii dekhbhaal kii jimmedaari ab kiski banati he
 Because the government bosses of Delhi are already shedding tears on their plight
 sarkaar kii taraf se milane vaali madad kii baant johte in gosadanon main naa to gaayon ko rakhane ke liye jagah he naa hi khilaane ke paise
 The plight of Delhi's government bosses is not hidden from anyone
 pehle se hi sankhya se adhik govenshon kii dekharekh karte in gosadanon me gaayon kii mauton kii khabaren samay-samay par surkhiyaan bhi batorti hai or kuch dinon kii sahanbhuti or gosadanon ke sanchaalkon par kadi kaarywahi kii hawaii baton ke bich yahaan zyada kuch nahin badalata
 Now that the central government has banned the illegal smuggling of cows and illegal slaughterhouses, the biggest question is how in the current situation will these gosdans bear the burden of additional cows
 jaaniye kyon pareshaan hai dilli ke sarkari gosadan- dilli main paanch sarkari gosadan hai- yahaan laai gai prati gaayon par har din ke hisaab se dilli sarkaar or emsidi kii taraf se keval 40 rupye die jate hai- in 40 rupye main govansh kii dekharekh, rahane kaa intjaam, khanpan, daawa or doctorl kharch, or vahaan kaam kar rahe karmchaariyon kii tankhwaah shaamil hoti he- us par bhi milane vaali is choti si sarkari madad kaa koi samay nahin hota
 Sometimes payments are made once in two years, even in late installments
 isse andaaj lagaana zyada mushkil nahin he ki sarkari gosadan aakhir itane bure halaat main kyon he
 There is no proper arrangement for keeping cows nor food for feeding
 pehle se hi apni badahaali par aansu bahaate in gosadanon par ab or atirikt gaayon kaa boj daalaa ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, people believe that before putting more cows here, the government should restore the dues immediately and pay them on time, after that help to build the infrastructure necessary to keep the cows in excess of the capacity so that the animals along with them Also, the people who take care of them should not bear additional burden
 dabar hare krishna goshaala (surhera gaanv)dilli ke surhera gaanv sthit is goshaala main maujuud infrastractor or milane vaale fund ke hisaab se yahaan 1600 govansh rakhane kii kshamta he
 Already 1700 bovines have been kept here and the money is owed to the Delhi government and MCD for the whole year and a half
 aise main har roj 5 se 10 kii sankhya main laai gai gaayon kii dekharekh karne inke liye mushkil ho rahaa he
 It is not that there is no lack of space here
 ye apni jeb se paise laga kar yahaan or govansh rakhane kaa intejaam kar rahe hai par unako khilaane ke paise kahaan se aaenge ye bada sawaal he
 Acharya Sushil Gosadan (ghummanhera village) The news of the death of more than 170 cows here last year shocked everyone and the most shocking thing is that neither concrete action nor any action was taken by the Delhi government and MCD Necessary initiatives were taken for proper maintenance of the cow dynasty
 aise main ye sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki pehle se badahaal pade in gosadanon par atirikt gaayon ke boj se hone vaali mauton kaa jimmedaar koun hoga? yahaan bhi jagah kii kami nahin he
 This gosdan of Ghumman Hera is built on 19 acres
 yahaan gaayon ko rakhane ke liye vyavasthaaon kaa abhaav he
 Shyam Sundar, who runs it, says that whatever is being spent, he has to pay from his pocket
 sarkaar kii taraf se koi madad nahin mil rahi
 Shri Krishna Goshala (bawana) It is the largest Government Goshal in delhi-ncr
 yahaan 5300 ke kareeb gauvanshon kii dekharekh puure shraddha bhav se kii jaati he
 Gautam, the cattle owner here, explains, "the construction here, where the living space and the hospital is run by the members of the trust here
" itane bade scale par ham govansh kii dekhbhaal karte hai par sarkari madad naa ke baraabar he or wo bhi tukdo main
 To keep more cows than this we need regular government support
 "ek taraf centre sarkargoraksha ke liye sakht kanoonabanane kii pahal kar rahi he vahiin duusari taraf dilli ke sarkari gosadano main goseva ke liye emsidi kii taraf se milane vaali raashi dedh-do saal main ek baar milti he wo bhi tab jab dilli emsidi kii satta par bijepi kabiz he
 However, due to irregular grants from the Delhi Government, the conditions of the Gosadans are getting worse from bad
 dilli sarkaar ne vigyaapan par 1500 karod kiye barbaad-jaavdekarsiem kejariwal bole-yah aarope saraasar jhooth or bebuniyaad hedilli main hawa kii sthiti behad kharaab ho chuki he
 To tackle this, aud-even came into force in the national capital from today
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne mantriyon ke saath karpul kii jabaki badhate pradooshan ke bich dipti siem manish sisodiya cycle se daftar pahunche
 But at the same time politics has also started on this
 dilli main pradooshan rokane ke prayaason ke bich kendriya paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar ne vigyaapan par 1500 karod barbaad kar die
 At the same time, CM Kejriwal has described these gifts to them as lies and baseless
 agar aapke paas androed phone he to yahaan aapke aas-paas kii hawa main pradooshan kaa haal milegservind kejariwal ne kaha ki, "padosi rajyon main fasal jalaane se nikle dhune ke kaaran dilli gas chembar main badal chuki he
 It is very important that we protect ourselves from this poisonous air
 "jaavdekar kaa aaropapalatwaar karte hue jaavdekar ne kaha ki dilli ke mukhyamantri dilli ke pradooshan par raajnneeti kar rahe hai or punjab va haryana ko paraali jalaane ke liye doshi tehra rahe hai
 He said that if the game of conviction starts, many hidden things will come out
 dusron ko dosha dene ke bajaay logon ko raahat pahunchane ke liye sabhi ke bich sahyog kaa prayaas hona chahie
 Odd-even in Delhi, but what about these 5 cities of NCR that are engulfed in mist? Javadekar said that the central government has given 1100 crores to help the farmers
 dilli sarkaar pradooshan kam karne ke liye kisaanon ko 1500 karod kyon nahin detii jo vigyaapan par kharch kiye hai
 He said that first the Delhi government should tell how much the orders of the CPC were followed
 hamaari sarkaar ne kisaanon ko 1100 karod rupee die aapane kya diya
 We have given 40 thousand machines to 22 lakh farmers
 lekin dilli sarkaar ne sirf vigyaapan par 1500 karod rupee kharch kar die
 Spending on pollution instead of advertising
 1500 karod rupee kisaanon ko de dete to pradooshan kam hota
 Citing the attitude of the Delhi government, Javadekar said that he never paid Rs 3,500 crore, which the local government had to contribute towards the construction of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and bypass in the vicinity of Delhi
