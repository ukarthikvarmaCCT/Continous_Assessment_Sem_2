 This rate is fixed for at least three years, provided there is no major change in the operating cost of the banks

 Overall, the interest rate for borrowers will be based on the external benchmark rate as well as the difference between cost and liability and the credit risk premium
 aapako kaise milegaa laabhkarj kii daren jab benchmark se sidhe jod di jaaengi to benchmark main kisi bhi tarah ke badlaav se karj kii dar swat: hi badal jaaegi
 For example, State Bank of India has linked its rates of debt to the repo rate, so whenever the RBI cuts its repo rate, the SBI loan rate should also be automatically reduced from the first day of the following month
 She goes
 karj kii daron ko bahari benchmark se jodgaye se karjon kaa maanakeekaran ho jayega or karj lene waalon ke liye tulana karnaa aasaan ho jayega
 What is the impact on existing loan holders? RBI has allowed existing borrowers to take advantage of the new benchmark based loan rates, though some money will have to be paid for it

 "the important fact-finding regime — the Marginal Cast of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR)" —is a reset period that is typically one year in home loans
 iskaa matlab he ki rindharak kii ore se kiya jane vaala bhugtan keval vaarshik aadhaar par sanshodhit kiya jaataa he
 But in the new system, RBI has asked banks to reset the interest rate at least once every month
 isse rindharak ke liye apni iemi ke prabandhan main samasya ho sakati he
 Gaurav Chopra, founder and CEO of India Lands, says, "in that situation when the interest rates rise, the loan monthly payment to the lender will also increase
 '' lekin mimanimantra ke emdi raaj khosla kehete hai, ''bahari benchmarkon se karj kaa judaav maujuuda or nae rindharak donon ke liye phydemand hoga kyonki byaaj dar kii sanganana ke liye laagat ke ghatakon ke bare main zyada paardarshita aegi

 Reliance Industries (RIL), the second largest company in the country in terms of market capitalization, is continuously being bought over companies in the consumer sector
 reliance ne pichley ek saal main kareeb 289 arab rupee ke 12 saude kiye hai
 In such a situation, it is interesting to know what is the plan of Reliance and Mukesh Ambani? According to calculations released by Jefferies Group LLC and Bloomberg, Reliance has done 12 deals to buy companies in the last one year
 asal main desh ke sabase dhani vyakti mukesh ambani ke netritv vaali company ab kanjumar bijness par focus kar rahi he

 At the same time, this question is also being questioned that what is the reason for such cruelty, such havoc

 It is believed that pornographic films are promoting abusive activities like rape

 Mobile phones are being talked about here
 ab porn discs kii bajaae clips bechi ja rahi hai
 Perhaps in a similar way, Manoj Sah and Pradeep, the 5-year-old innocent doll in Delhi's Gandhinagar, had found klpsi on their mobile phones
 police ke mutabik bacchee ke saath darindagi ko anjaam dene se pehle donon apane mobile phone par ashleel clips hi dekh rahe the
 'mail Today' pirated and outlawed, but reached the traditional palace market, Gaffar Market, and Nehru Place, which provided adult entertainment content, and found that things had changed now
 ab dukaanon ke saamne na hi kisi nagn mahila ke poster dikhaai dete hai or na hi celsman graahakon par tut padate hai
 Now the whole game is about mobile phones and memory cards, on which porn content is fed directly
 aakhir yah sab kaise hota he
 Actually, as it is said in Karol Bagh and Ghaffar Market, there is no dearth of shops if you are looking for 'goods'

 After the hot summer of increased parking fee outside the markets on weekends, now people have reduced the number of private vehicles, but there is a lot of resentment for this decision
 apni biimaar maa ko ames main chekup karwaane ke liye lekar aae noida ke varun naaraaz dikhe
 Angry, he said what has happened to the Delhi government? Did the government not see the increased pollution in this season last year? This time he did not take any concrete steps while learning
 kyon intjaar kiya halaaton ke bigadane kaa? ab chaahe parking rates badhaao yaa od-ivan lao jo nuksaan hone tha wo to ho chukaa he
 Varun said that his mother's health has worsened due to increased pollution and he brought her to his car from Noida to Delhi for a checkup
 varun ko kai jagah badha huaparking shulkadena padaa
 After all why the burden on the general public was first hit by inflation, then the loss of health due to contaminated air and now the parking fee increased four times and the screw of aud-even formula on the other side
 dilli kii janata sawaal uthaa rahi he ki aakhir kuch bhi ho har taraf se unheen ko kyon sahanaa padataa he? privet company main marketing main kaam karne vaale ashok kaa kahana he ki mujhe apane kaam ke silsile main jagah-jagah janaa padataa he, jiske chalate apni car mujhe kai baar bazaaron yadaphtaronke saamne park kerani padati he
 You will not believe that i would not have paid so much parking fee in a month as much as i have been paying for the last four days, it has become too much, the entire budget has gone wrong
 halaat ye hai ki majaburi main nikali privet gaadiyaan bazaaron yaa daftaron par sarkari parking ke bajaae sadakon par park ho rahi hai
 Aditi, who visits her office in Connaught Place from Malviya Nagar, is also worried
 unhone kaha is baar agar mahilaon ko od-ivan main chhot nahin milegi to mujhepublic transportya metro se offis janaa padegaa

 siddharth bandra main rahete hai or unke ghar se waapas lautne ke liye aalia ne apane bodyguard ko phone kiya ki vah unhen ghar lekar jaaen
 According to Spotboye's news, Alia's bodyguard picked up her phone after calling her several times

 External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee did not deny the option of using the army against Pakistan
 "we will take the strictest steps so that such incidents do not happen again
" '' udhar, america videsh mantri kondalija rice bharat ke gusse ko shant karne ke liye dilli ain
 He said, "pakistan needs to act with firmness immediately, extend a hand of cooperation towards India and maintain transparency
" '' phir ve pakistani netritv par dabaav daalane islamabad chali gayi
 The major powers of the world were seeking evidence about Pakistan's involvement in the attack
 lihaaja, bharat ne kutanyik hamalaa shuru kar diya
 "we have enough evidence about Pakistan's involvement," Mukherjee told India Today
 isliye pakistan ko aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf kuch thos karrwai kerani chahie
 As a first step, India has allowed the investigating agencies of countries like the US, UK and Israel whose citizens were killed in the Mumbai attack
 unhen khufia suchanaaen muhai karai jaaengi or giraftaar aatankwaadi se poochtacha kii ijaajat bhi di jaaegi taaki yah sabit kiya ja sake ki hamale kaa pakistan se taalluk tha or pakistani pratishthan kaa ek halakaa isamen shaamil tha
 Meanwhile, Indian intelligence agencies have received the information which clearly shows that Pakistani was involved in the attack
 isamen mumbai hamale ke baad pakistani fouj ke ek kor commander kii islamabad main apane ek samakaksh adhikari se baatcheet shaamil he
 The commander told the officer, "took good fun to these Indians, now see how India will burn
" '' agenciyon ne lashkare-tayba ke controlar muzaffar or islamabad sthit pakistani fouj ke ek le
 The conversation between the colonel is also taped
 yah propeganda bhi ho saktaa he, jaisaaki unhone kargil yuddh ke dauraan kiya tha
 So the agencies have to come up with evidence that, in the first phase, India hopes to form an international coalition against Pakistan sponsored terrorism
 is pahal ke tahat, america or suraksha parishad ke anya sadasyon par is baat ke liye dabaav daalaa jayega ki ve aatankwaad par vyapak sandhi ke liye sanyukt raashtra main apane prabhaav kaa istemaal karen
 Such a treaty was proposed by India which has been in cold storage for the last 12 years
 iske atirikt, yah suraksha parishad ke prastaavon 1373 or 1566 ko puri tarah se lagu karne ke liye bhi dabaav banayega
 These proposals provide for global action against terrorism and punish countries that violate them
 ye prastaav lagu hue to pakistan par ranneetik dabaav banaae rakhane vaale america, britain or saudi arab use apni aatankwaadi sanrachana ko khatm karne ke liye majaboor kar sakate hai
 India's eyes on pressure on Pakistan 7
 6 arab dollar ke us package par hai jisaki ghoshnaa antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne pakistan ko aarthik sankat se ubaarane ke liye kii he
 If Europe and other countries agree to ban its distribution, Pakistan's bankruptcy will come out
 visheshgy jaanate hai ki pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye bharat ke saamne simit vikalp hai
 Pakistan also knows this, which is why it is denying to have its hand in the attack, making little promises of cooperation and waiting for the world to be distracted by the incident
 bharat ke ranneetikaron ke liye yah chintaa kii baat rahi he ki pakistan apni us niti main safal rahaa he jise pakistan main ucchayukta rah chuke ji

 Pakistan has seen that India cannot attack it all the way because it too has become a nuclear power
 1999 main kargil yuddh ke dauraan bhi bharat ne kashmir seemaa se baahar jaakar pakistan par hamalaa nahin kiya
 The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee did not want to increase this war so much that the nuclear attack was brought about
 phir, 2001 main sansad par hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan ke saath kutanyik sambandh khatm kar die or simaaon par fouj tainaat kar di
 After nine months of fighting, India not only withdrew from its military border, but also forged diplomatic relations with Pakistan
 isse pakistan ko yah sandesh mila ki yuddh bharat ke liye vikalp nahin he
 Islamabad's defense establishment, especially the ISI, knew that it could carry out major attacks, but India could not take stern retaliation
 yahi vajah he ki haal ke varshon main bharat main aatankwaadi hamale bade hai
 Mumbai is an example of how strong Pakistan is
 donon deshon ke bich pichley chaar varshon main shanti kii jab bhi pahal hui, ve log, khaskar sena or iesai main baithe bharat virdohi tatv, pareshaan ho uthe jinhen takaraavpurn sambandhon se phayda hua tha
 Meanwhile, India was not only demonstrating its strength by having a major nuclear deal with the US, but also creating a tizzy for Pakistan by building a strong relationship with Hamid Karzai's government in Afghanistan
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke ausat 7 pratishat kii dar se vikaas ke kaaran pakistan pichhadta hua anubhav kar rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Pakistan was seen as a failed state due to political instability and terrorist attacks, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad
 mumbai par hamale kaa makasad yah darshana tha ki bharat apni badhati takat ke baavjood pakistan kii tarah hi bhedya he
 The attack on Mumbai was planned very carefully and its timing was also chosen correctly so that maximum benefit would be given and minimum response should be taken
 ganit yah he ki manmohan sarkaar duusari partiyon ke samarthan par tiki he or bhartiya raajnneeti banty hui he, isliye bharat kii javaabi faujee karrwai kii sambhaavna kam he
 On the other hand, the Bush administration's collapse of the border and the dangerous turning point of the war in Afghanistan, the US would not want to destabilize the region and pressurize India not to threaten military action
 pakistan pehle hi sanket de chukaa he ki tanaav badha to vah afghanistan seemaa par taliban or al 
 Can send one lakh soldiers deployed to fight Qaida on the Indian front
 bharat bhi isi tarah kaa tark de saktaa he or pakistan par dabaav badhaane ke liye america tathaa apane mitra deshon ko baadhya kar saktaa he
 Also, the world is facing financial crisis and it does not want an explosive situation in South Asia
 baharhaal, jan bhaavana ko bhaanpate hue bharat sainya karrwai kii sambhaavnaaon par vichaar karata rahaa he
 His plan includes airstrikes on terrorist camps in Pakistani-occupied Kashmir
 lekin purv senadhyaksh general ve
 P
 malik kehete hai, ''aise hamale jokhim bhare hote hai
 They can lead to full war
 '' in shiviron kii jagah badalte rahane or aatankwaadi sarganaon kii gatividhiyon ke bare main bhartiya soochna ke sandigdh hone ke kaaran aise hamale se milane vaala manovaigyanik laabh pakistan kii javaabi karrwai se khatm ho saktaa he
 Air Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, who is the co-director of the Center for Air Power Studies, warns, "war should be the last option for us and its objective should be completely clear
" hamen aatankwaadiyon ke bune jaal main nahin funsana chahie, jo samoochee shanti prakriya ko nasht karnaa chaahate hai
 "but others like Brigadier Gurmeet Kanwal, director of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, believe that" punitive action must be taken against Pakistan to deliver a strong message
 " '' unke mutabik, pakistan ke mahatvapurn pratishthanon par top se gole daagna chahie or pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main aatankwaadi addon par vishesh balon ko hamalaa bolnaa chahie
 Apart from this, there is also the option of covert action
 lekin '90 ke dashak main pradhanmantri rahe indrakumar gujral dwaara iske khatme ke aadesh dene ke baad se bharat ne is vikalp kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 There are other ways to create fear in Pakistan, which are less risky
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki bharat ko baluchistan masale ko ubhaarna chahie yaa gilgit main algaavvaadi andolanon ko hawa deni chahie taaki pakistan bachaav par utar aae
 However, the option of military action is open
 parthasarathi kehete hai, ''narak kaa rasta aam taur achche iraadon se bharaa hota he
 "obviously, to curb Pakistan, careful action must be taken after careful consideration

 bollywood abhinayta aamir khan ne eibi ko latada
 He did not like AIB at all and was called by Aamir as a lewd joke
 aamir ne kaha ki haalanki maine puraa sho nahin dekha par jitna dekha usase kaaphi niraash hua
 After the AIB was opposed, some Bollywood celebrities had called it 'right of Expression', saying that we have the right, to joke and to abuse, because everyone abuses their friends
 Then why do people's minds and thinking become so small when a celebrity does? But unlike him, Aamir said that it is wrong to say such things in the name of 'right of expression'
 ye ek bhadda mazaaq he, jiskaa samarthan bollywood se hua
 Admittedly, we have the 'right of expression', under which we have the freedom to speak our words, but we also have some responsibilities towards society
 aamir ne yah bhi kaha ki ham koi 14 saal ke ladke nahin, jo aisi gaaliyon ko or aise mazaaq ko sunakar utsahit hon or taaliyaan bajaaen
 We have grown up now and we should understand our responsibilities
 darasal, jab se eibi kaa video you-tub par aayaa bollywood se pratikriyaayein aani shuru ho gai
 When someone came in support, someone called it an ugly joke
 khaastaur se vah log iske samarthan main dikhe, jo eibi main khud gaali-galouj karne shariq hue jaise karan johar, ranvir singh or arjuna kapur
 Before Aamir, Salman Khan has also shown his attitude towards the show that he did not like AIB
 virodh itnaa badha kii baad main you tub se is video ko hataa liya gaya
 But the echoes of these abuses are still roaming the corridors

 According to Utsarve in the NDA data, “the figures for the NDA are as bad as they were against the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in July 2013 i
e
 9 months before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ”us vakt 39 fisadi voter upie kaa virodh kar rahe the or sirf 31 fisadi hi uskaa samarthan karte dikh rahe the
 At that time, 30 per cent were not in a position to express any opinion
 taaja MOTN survey bataata he ki is saal janvari main karai gai aakhri study se ab tak sattarudh party ne voting-chwis-index par 2 fisadi kaa ghota khaaya he
 Earlier this year, around 34 percent of the voters were of the opinion that if Lok Sabha elections are held at the same time, they would like to vote for the BJP
 paanch maheene baad ab bijepi ke samarthan main khadey votaron kii sankhya ghatakar 32 fisadi rah gai he
 The study says, "the 2 per cent decline in the number of bjp-backed voters may be modest, but it is a sign of a decrease in popularity
 yani bijepi graph ko neeche girane se rokane main naakaam rahi he
 "according to a survey conducted by lokniti-csds in May last year, bjp's popularity was at the peak, then 39 percent were seen supporting the party
 study me kaha gaya he, ‘narendra modi sarkaar ke khilaaf anti inkambency bhaavana badhane kaa arth he ki bijepi ke samarthan aadhaar ko nuksaan hua he
 As far as the entire NDA is concerned, 37 percent of the total voters are seen standing in its favor
 janvari se ab tak isamen teen fisadi kii kami ai he
 Compared to May 2017, the nda's support base has decreased by 8 per cent
 sahyogi dalon ke votaron main 52% modi ke sathsurve bataata he ki sahyogi dalon ke votaron main se aadhe se zyada yani 52 fisadi modi sarkaar ko 2019 main ek or mauka dene ke haq main hai

 survey kaa kahana he, “agar yahi bhaavana aane vaale maheenon jor pakadati hai to ye naa sirf bijepi balki iske sahyogiyon ke liye bhi gambhir chunauti hoga
 "putting aside the bjp's performance in the regions, the bjp's performance in Karnataka, South India remains a crook for the ruling party
" paanch dakshini rajyon ko mila diya jaae or aaj chunaav hon to vahaan sirf 18 fisadi voter hi bijepi ke samarthan main dikh rahe hai
 According to the survey, the support-base of BJP in South India has decreased by 7% since January

 Talking about North India, according to the MOTN survey, now about 39 percent of the voters in this area are supporting BJP / NDA
 janvari main ye aankada 45 fisadi par tha
 The survey says, "the reason for this significant decline in bjp's vote share in the region is the sudden and conspicuous fall of the party's popularity in a very important state like Uttar Pradesh
 saal ke shuru se ab tak bijepi kii lokapriyata main 8 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 "" SP-BSP alliance, which came into existence two months ago, is looking ahead of BJP in the choice of voters
 ”survey ke mutabik agar pashchim or madhya bharat kii baat kii jaae to endie ne upie par apni badhat bana rakhi he
 But the growing support base of the Congress in Gujarat shows that the gap between the two national alliances is now shrinking
 may 2017 main is kshetra main endie ko upie par 24 fisadi kii badhat hasil thi
 The survey shows that this increase has come down to 5 percent now
 gujarat ke alaava congress madhya pradesh main bhi behatar pradarshan karti najar aa rahi he
 Here, both at the Lok Sabha and Assembly levels, the Congress is getting a comfortable edge over the BJP
 survey bataata he ki maharashtra main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan aage he lekin congress or ensipi use kaante kii takkar de rahe hai
 Talking about the eastern parts of the country, support for BJP / NDA seems to be stable in the last one year
 bijepi kaa bihar (jediu ke saath) or odisha main acha pradarshan karnaa jari he
 However, it could not make much of an impact in West Bengal
 vahaan trinmul congress bahut majboot sthiti main bijepi se kahin aage he
 If we talk about Jharkhand and Assam, then there are clearly signs of Congress becoming stronger again
 aarthik muddearthik muddon ko lekar votaron kii jo ashankaayen hai wo beete 5 maheenon main kam nahin kii ja saki hai
 According to the survey, it has increased in some areas
 berogari adhiktar votaron kii mukhya chintaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 1 in every 4 voters says that unemployment remains one of the biggest problems in the country
 MOTN survey ke mutabik berogari ke alaava guds and sarvice tex (jiesti) ko lekar badhata asantosh bhi sarkaar ke liye samasya vaali baat he
 Nearly a quarter of the participants, ie 24 per cent, were stating GST as harsh in the survey conducted in January
 taaja survey main ye aankada bad kar 40 fisadi ho gaya he
 The claim of the ADA government 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' is also no longer enticing for voters
 study ke mutabik pratibhaagiyon main sirf 30 fisadi hi sarkaar ke is daawey se sahamat dikhaai die ki vikaas kaa laabh sabhi virgon ko mila he
 non-nda, non-upa Parties Benefit The UPA is not getting the benefit of increasing unpopularity among farmers and traders regarding NDA
 endie kaa vot share kisaanon main janvari kii tulana main teen fisadi gira he
 It was 40 percent in January, which has now come down to 37 percent
 upie ko chhodkar anya raajnneetik dalon ne isi dauraan apana samarthan aadhaar 23 se 28% yani 5 fisadi badhaayaa he
 The status of the Congress As the popularity of js's popularity declined from May 2017 to January 2018, the Grand Old Party could not bring about a change in the last five months
 har chaar main se ek voter yani 25 fisadi janvari main congress ke samarthan main khadey the
 Five months later, this support base remains the same
 haalanki congress ke sahyogiyon ne janvari kii tulana main samarthan aadhaar kuch badhaayaa he
 Five months ago this base was 5 percent, which has now increased to 6 percent
 iskaa matlab he ki agar aaj desh main chunaav karaayaa jaae to congress kii aguai vaala upie 31 fisadi vot hasil karegaa
 According to the survey, other parties whose support has increased in the last 5 months include BSP and its partner Samajwadi Party in UP
 donon partiyon ke samarthan aadhaar main pichley paanch maheene kii tulana main ek-ek fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 Today, in the situation like this and if immediate elections are held, non-nda and non-upa parties are seen taking 32 per cent vote share
 philhal modi sarkaar virdohi vot vibhinn vipakshi partiyon main bantata dikh rahaa he
 Of these, only half the Congress-led NDA seems to be getting it
 vahiin bijepi kii aguai vaale endie ko sarkaar samarthak voton kaa teen chauthai hissaa miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Increasing dissatisfaction about the government According to the MOTN survey, the bad thing for the BJP is that the dissatisfaction in the country is increasing due to the overall performance of the Modi government
 may 2017 main jahaan ye 27 fisadi ke str par tha wo janvari main bad kar 40 fisadi or ab 47 fisadi par aa gaya he
 That is, the level of dissatisfaction has increased by 20 percent in one year

 nyaayalay ne kaha ki ye raajnneetik or dharmik mudde hai or ham isamen padana nahin chaahate hai
 The All India Personal Law Board said that the fatwa is not binding on the people and it is only the opinion of the Mufti and he has no right to enforce it

 prashanth ne twit kar kaha ki 15 se adhik rajyon main gaiyr-bhaajapai mukhyamantri hai or ye aise rajya hai jahaan desh kii 55 fisadi se adhik jansankhya he
 He further added that the surprise is that how many of them were consulted on NRC and how many are ready to implement it in their respective states! 15 plus states with more than 55% of India's population have non-bjp Chief Ministers 
 Wonder how many of them are consulted and are on-board for NRC in their respective states!!bataa den,bihar ke simanchal kshetra ke kuch jilon main bijepi lagaataar NRC kii maang karti rahi he
 Giriraj Singh, a minister in the central government, recently attacked the Bihar government over NRC by tweeting

 In Bihar, circumstances are not demanding the NRC

 bihar main somvaar ko shuru hua raajnneetik drama mangalvaar ko charam par pahunch gaya
 Nine of the 13 rebels of the Lalu Prasad Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) returned to the party, shattering the story of Tut and putting Lalu in an aggressive posture
 vidhayakon kii parade ke baad rajd adhyaksh lalu prasad ne mangalvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apni alpamat kii sarkaar ko bachaane ke uddeshy se rajd vidhayakon ko janata dal united main shaamil hone ke liye rishwat di
 Lalu Prasad, who reached Patna from New Delhi after hearing the news of the breakup, said, 'nitish Kumar government is killing democracy
 yah bihar main partiyon ko tod rahi he
 'he alleged,' They (nitish Kumar) are paying crores of rupees in bribes
 ' Earlier, 16 of the 22 RJD mlas attended the legislature party meeting held at the official residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 somvaar ko 13 vidhayakon ke tut kaa daawa kiya gaya tha, lekin mangalvaar kii baithak main unamem se nau vidhayak shaamil hue
 RJD leaders said that four rebel mlas - the party's chief whip Samrat Chaudhary, Raghavendra Pratap Singh, Javed Iqbal Ansari and Akhtarul Islam - did not attend the meeting and the two mlas could not come due to their constituency
 rajd vidhayak dal ke netaa abdul baari siddiki ne kaha ki baithak main hissaa nahin lene vaale chaar baagiyon ko rajd kaaran bataao notice jari karegaa
 He said that he would be asked to explain his stand regarding the break-up and the party would take action after clarification
 siddiki ne kaha, 'foot kii gatividhi saaf ho jane ke baad party vidhansabha adhyaksh se unki sadsyta samaapt karne kii guzarish karegi

 They said that they would sit on the Raj Bhavan
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue lalu prasad ne kaha ki apni sarkaar bachaane ke liye vah chaalen chal rahe hai
 His government has been in a minority since it was a 'divers' with the BJP
 apni sarkaar ko sthir karne ke liye vah duusare dalon main send lagane kii koshish karte rahete hai
 Lalu Prasad said in his well-known style, 'first we sent him to jail with the NDA (national Democratic Alliance) and now our party had gone to grab
 ' At the same time, senior RJD leader and former Union Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that Nitish Kumar has tried to strangle democracy
 unhone vidhansabha adhyaksh ke saath sajeesh rachi thi
 The post of Speaker of the Assembly has also been misused
 dukh kii baat he ki jis par samvidhan or niyamon kii raksha kii jimmedaari he, vahi iskaa hatyara niklaa
 Raghuvansh said, 'the world knows that when two-thirds of the members are separated, only then they will be recognized as a separate faction under the anti-defection law
 aise main vidhansabha adhyaksh ne kis tarah 13 vidhayakon kii tut ko sweekaar kiya or aanan-fanan main unhen pruthak gut ke rup main manyata dete hue adhisuchana jari kar di
 It is clear from this that the assembly speaker’s seat has been misused in this case
 ' unhone vidhayakon ko karodon rupee rishwat or mantri pad kaa laalach die jane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Announcing to take this fight to the public, Raghuvansh said in a challenging manner, 'see who is the heroic sacrifice in this India, whose artery has blood and whose artery has water

 Meanwhile, there are also indications that the Assembly session may be postponed indefinitely if the deadlock is not resolved
 vipaksh ke dabaav se avichlit bi es yediurppa sarkaar sibiai jaanch karaane se inkaar kar chuki he
 But the opposition is adamant on its demand, which has led to a deadlock
 vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa siddermaiya (congress) ne bataaya ‘‘ham dharna jari rakhenge
 There is no question of withdrawing from your demand
 agar sarkaar nahin maanegi to ham janata ke bich jaaenge
 "congress and JDS members have come together to demand a CBI inquiry and their proximity is telling that they want to pressurize the BJP government
" dharna de rahe vidhayakon ne kal duusari raat vidhansabha parisar main sadan tathaa lobby ke andar sote hue guzari

 If you ask anyone about Kashmir today, from Delhi to Mumbai, he will say that something is going to happen there
 kashmir main rahane vaale logon se baat karen to ve bhi yahi kahenge ki kuch bada hone vaala he
 Talking to the security forces, they say that we will execute as soon as we get orders from above
 rahi sahi kasar amarnath yatra ko 15 din pehle khatm karne or paryatakon ko kashmir chhodane kii hidaayat dene se puri ho gai he
 From above, whatsapp University is never behind in heating up the market of rumors
 saaf kahen to aaj kashmir ko lekar har jagah dar, khauf or asamanjas kaa maahaul he
 Looking at the atmosphere created these days, the question arises that what is going to happen in Kashmir? While covering Kashmir for so many years, i myself have seen that for the first time there is no threat of terrorists from Amarnath Yatra nor for the first time IED and sniper rifles have been found here
 to phir achaanak aisa kya hua he ki dilli se lekar kashmir tak charchaaon kaa bazaar garm he? jahaan tak mujhe yaad aata he ki pehle to kai baar aisa bhi hua he ki aatanki hamale main amarnath yatriyon kii maut tak hui he, phir bhi yatra roki nahin gai
 Through this persistence, the message was conveyed directly to the terrorists that the government and security forces were not afraid of the terrorists
 phir aaj kyon kashmir main ek nayaa muhaavara gadhane kii koshish ho rahi he
 The condition in Kashmir is that there is panic and chaos within everyone living there
 jahaan sarkari amala apana taam jhaam durust karne main juta he to aam aadmi bhi rashan kii dukaanon par line main lagakar maheene bhar kaa anaaj kharid rahaa he
 People are withdrawing cash from atms to face any possible trouble
 aam logon main afratfari ke bich bhi jimmedaar str par koi sahi jawaab nahin de rahaa he
 All are trying to postpone their responsibilities
 aakhir, kashmir or kashmir ko lekar desh main ban rahe bhay ke maahaul kii jimmedaari kisi ko to leni hogi
 Every hour a new rumor is brewing in Kashmir which creates a new skepticism in the minds of the people
 sabhi jagah gahamagahami kaa maahaul he, naa koi aage dekh rahaa he or naa hi peeche
 Everyone's objective is to reach a safe home in some way
 ye maahaul pichley hafte se tab bananaa shuru hua jab kashmir main ardhsainik balon ke das hajaar atirikt jawan bheje gaye
 Meanwhile, news is also coming that the railway has asked its officials to collect the ration of four months there
 ye khabar bhi teji se fail rahi he ki kashmir main or surakshabalon kii tainaati ho rahi he
 The Army and Air Force have been placed on high alert
 inako koun bataae ki kashmir main surakshabal hameshaa alert par hi rahete hai
 He is well aware that there has been a slight lapse and he may have to lose his life
 in sabake bich raajnneetik bazaar main dhara 35e or or dhara 370 ko lekar bayanon ne maahaul ko or tanaav main daal diya he
 There is a lot of discussion and debate about what will happen on these streams? In view of this, the notes of all Kashmiri leaders have also become one
 har koi kehane laga ki agar inase chhedchhad kii gai to kashmir jal uthegaa
 Although Governor Satyapal Malik is repeatedly saying that nothing like this is going to happen, ignore the rumors, but now it seems that the matter has gone beyond his assurance
 ye sahi he ki dhara 35e or 370 ko hataanaa bijepi sarkaar ke angede main he
 The government can take some decision regarding this, however, this matter is in the Supreme Court, so Delhi is not speaking anything openly in this matter, which is creating an atmosphere of uncertainty
 kai tarah kii baaten sunne main aa rahi hai
 One is that on August 15, the Prime Minister is going to make a big announcement and the whole exercise is being done with him
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki jammu ko alag rajya bana diya jayega or kashmir va ladakh kendra shashit pradesh bana diya jayega
 Assembly elections will be held in Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days and the government will try to hold elections without any hindrance, in that sense also this movement is being seen
 kaha to ye bhi ja rahaa he ki haal-fihlaal main kupwada or tangadhaar main jis tarah se pakistan kii ore se aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane kii koshish hui he usko lekar sarkaar koi badi karrwai kar sakati he
 Sources are also indicating that Pakistan is trying to provoke India so that India can take some big action and they will do any such action in which the unwanted India gets caught in the trap
 darasal bharat ke inkaar ke baavjood america kii ore se do baar kashmir ko lekar madhyasthata kii baat karnaa bhi samaanya baat nahin lag rahi he
 On such occasions the government cannot escape its responsibility
 use khulkar saamne aakar apni baat kehani chahie or yah bataanaa chahie ki wo har kashmiri kaa dard mahasoos karti he
 Nothing will be wrong with anyone
 kisi ko darane yaa ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Scare the one who has done wrong
 kahin aisa naa ho ye khamoshi kashmiriyon ko dilli se or dur le jaae
 The old wounds should not be green again

 ham 2015 ke kashton ko nahin bhuulenge—narendra modi kii kathmando kii haalia yatra ke dauraan kai yuvaaon ne in shabdon main pratikriya vyakt kii thi
 The economic blockade had made Nepal helpless and resulted in many deaths
 isse paidaa hui daraar ko paatane ke liye bharat ke pradhanmantri kii sirf ek yatra se kuch zyada kii aavashyaktaa he
 Doubt and mistrust have become major obstacles to good relations between the two countries
 acchhee baat yah he ki haalanki donon pakshon ne ranneetik or rajnatik galtiyaan kii hai, lekin nepal mahasoos karata he ki bharat ‘aprihaary’ he or bharat jaanata he ki vah ab kathmando main kisi kamjor sarkaar se baat nahin kar rahaa
 Prime Minister pi
 Sharma Oli came to power in February 2018 with an impressive majority making the issue 'anti-india'
 bharat ne nepal ke saath shanti or ek nai shuruyaat kaa rasta nikaalane ke liye ‘aitihaasik’, ‘bhugolic’, ‘dharmik’ or yahaan tak ki ‘paariwarik’ sambandhon tak kaa samaran kara daalaa
 While the Oli government seemed open-minded to the idea of working with India, the people of Nepal are not yet convinced
 modi kaa dharmik tarika unke liye ek shandaar ranneeti se zyada kuch nahin tha
 The need now extends beyond a bus service and some guest houses
 bharat ne donon deshon ke logon ke bich dharmik paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye ‘ramayana circuit’ or ‘buddha circuit’ ke vikaas kii ghoshnaa kii
 The question is why it took India so long for this announcement? Strategic Affairs Analyst Dr
 si
 Raja Mohan says that South Asians have always traveled to each other's countries for religious reasons, but India never saw it as an important strategy
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘yah kabhi hamaari rashtriya praathamikta nahin rahi, lekin aisa kehane ke liye paryaapt saboot hai ki ab ham badal rahe hai
 a road or bus service does not create a boundary, you have to build an infrastructure around it
 ham dekhenge ki kya modi us morche par kuch kar dikhaate hai?’’jahaan nepal bharat ko ‘lenden’ ke chashme se dekh rahaa he, vahiin dharmik sambandhon ko punerjeevit karne se nai dilli ko logon se judane main madad mil sakati he
 Nepal's current government is seen as close to China
 lekin bharat is aadhaar par nepal se naaraaz nahin ho saktaa
 Nepal says that the blockade that India did in 2015 brought Kathmando closer to Beijing
 bharat ko ek badhat uplabdh he, vah himalay he, jo bharat kii taraf pair jamaane main china ke liye ek prakritik baadha he
 Second, China will never offer what India has to offer - the open border
 china ne nepal main sadakon, pulon, baandhon ke nirmaan se bharat ko nahin roka he, lekin bharat ne vaada kii gai pariyojnaon ko puraa karke dene kii kshamta main kami darshai he
 This has happened a little because of India's procedural delays and partly because of the Nepal government's delay
 modi kii asli pariksha bharat ke bhugolic judaav or aarthik kshamta kaa laabh uthaane main hogi
 India has compromised on being sensitive to the internal politics of Nepal, due to which Madhesi feels cheated at the hands of New Delhi
 kathmando ne nepal main chini hastkshep ke sambandh main bharat kii samvedansheeltaa ko samaj liya he
 In the past, Nepal was troubled by India's excessive intervention
 nepal main rajnatik sankraman kii baat karte hue, kathmando main kiye gaye naagarik swaagat main modi ne kaha, ‘‘ek tarah se, ham mount everest ke aadhaar shivi main pahunch gaye hai
 We are yet to climb the peak
 jis tarah parvatarohiyon ko nepali sherpaon se sudrudh samarthan miltaa he, usee prakaar bharat vikaas ke liye nepal kii raah main sherpa vaala kaam karne ke liye taiyaar he
 However, the message from Kathmandu is very clear and clear — Nepal will no longer dance to the tune of India
 nepal ko bharat main kisi sherpa nahin, ek dost kii jarurat he

 pichhali july main special task force (esaity) ke jasuson ne dudhiyon ke vesh main madhya pradesh ke muraina jile main ambah sthit van khandeshwari doodh sheet sanyantr par nigaah rakhana shuru kiya
 Reliable intelligence was received that due to festive season, when demand increases anyway, the sale of adulterated milk in the area has increased tremendously
 jab unhone pataa kiya ki van khandeshwari main kitna kaccha doodh aata he or kitna baahar jaataa he, to pataa chalaa ki donon aankadon main bahut baari fark tha
 He feared adulteration, but two days later, during the raid on the plant, his eyes were wide open after seeing the huge scale of adulteration business
 sanyantr main saikadon kilo rasayan, tel or disergent kaa bhandar jamaa tha
 Thousands of liters of 'synthetic milk' were being made and sent to packaging and distribution centers
 phir yah packetband 'doodh' rashtriya rajdhani, gudgaanv or noida sareekhe bade shaharon tak main bechaa jaataa he
 What the STF felt was allegedly just a sample of the entire operation
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rasayan supplai karne vaale or sthaneey adhikari donon is kahin zyada bade gorakhdhandhe main shaamil hai
 Some say that the State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officers are generally frozen in the same area for many years, so there is a nexus between the dairy units and the officers responsible for their maintenance
 ek or raaj kii baat yah he ki gwalior-chambal ilaake main sampann log doodh ke liye khud apane maveshi rakhte or paalate hai—sthaneey logon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki yah gorakhdhandha kitne vishaal paimaane par chal rahaa he
 a week after the raid on the Van Khandeshwari plant, the racket was raided across the state and agencies included milk and other dairy products as part of their investigation
 khandeshwari ke alaava muraina, gwalior or ujjain sahit aasapaas ke ilaakon se jin logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, un par rashtriya suraksha kanoon (rasuka) lagaaya gaya he
 However, many questions have arisen from this whole incident, what is the economics of this fraud and who are its important players? Is the action taken by the government enough, or is it just pretense to suppress public anger? The big question is why is the adulteration of Bhind and Morena flourishing so much? Bhind and Morena districts, once inhabited by the dominance of dacoit gangs, have a large population of Gujars and they are largely involved in animal husbandry and related activities
 These include dairy works
 ilaake kii jameen oobad-khabad or anurvar he, isliye kheti bahut munaafe kaa dhandha nahin he
 Manufacturing works are almost completely absent
 nateeja yah ki doodh or deyari utpaada yahaan kii gramin arthvyavastha kaa ahm hissaa hai
 The law and order situation in Chambal area has always been poor and the administration's emphasis is not much
 so, bhrashtachar bhi aam he
 For example, the adulteration game is not limited to the dairy industry alone
 estf ab is ilaake main khaadya telon main milawat ke falte-phoolate gorakhdhandhe par bhi apana shinkaja kas rahaa he
 Mustard is a special crop of this region, so many oil mills are also running in the area and there have been reports of repeated effects that adulteration of rice husk and cheap palm oil is being done in mustard oil
 muraina oil milon ke ek kaamgaar apana naam jaahir na karne kii shart par kehete hai, ''bazaar kii jaruraton ke hisaab se or ilaake vishesh main jis swaad kii maang hoti he, usko dhyaan main rakhte hue milavati tel taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Everyone, including the inter-state (officers), food and drug departments and police, is complicit in this
 ''kaise hota he yahdeyari udyog pashupaalak kisaanon or transportron se shuru hota he
 Transporters collect milk from farmers twice a day and transport it to local cold units
 ise lene se pehle lactometer se doodh kii shuddhta kii jaanch kii jaati he—niyamit taur par nahin bhi to gaahe-ba-gaahe kii hi jaati he
 The milk is then cooled to 1 degree Celsius
 phir ise tankeron main bhar kar prasanskaran ikaayiyon main bhej diya jaataa he
 Here milk / powder, etc
 are packaged / processed
 aam jabaan main kahen to yahi milawat he jo sheet ikaayiyon main kii jaati he or isaki sidhi-saadi vajah he, in jagahon se hokar guzarane vaale doodh kii taadaad
 The process of making 'synthetic milk' includes refined oil or vegetable, soap and shampoos, among other chemicals
 taral padaarthon main vasa ko naapane ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale lactometer kii jaanch main is kism kaa nakli or milavati doodh badi aasaani se paas ho jaataa he, kyonki isamen tel mila hota he
 This gorakhandha business is going on a horrific scale
 gwalior main estf ke police adheekshak amit singh kehete hai, ''sirf bhind or muraina main hi 200 se zyada sheet ikaiyaan hone kaa anumaan he
 "the seizures made by STF personnel from such cold plants are enough to shake the bones of anyone
" van khandeshwari se jabt kii gai chizon main sodium citrate, maltodextrin powder or sodium thayosulphate ke bore shaamil hai
 Detergent and thousands of liters of vegetable and refined oil have also been recovered significantly
 ambah ke maa kailadevi sheet sanyantr main ek or chaape ke dauraan epad ke afasaron ne 36,000 litre synthetic doodh, rifind tel ke 1,400 tin, castic soda ke 550 thile, hydrogenikrut vasa ke 17 can or malairahit doodh powder ke 550 thile jabt kiye
 The milk produced in these units was to be taken to Aligarh, Meerut, Kanpur and Agra
 ek or chaape main bhind jile ke lahar kii gopal aais factory main, estf ne 2,000 litre synthetic doodh, 1,000 kilo maava or 1,500 kilo synthetic paneer jabt kiya
 Livestock farmers standing at the very first end of the adulteration price chain earn about 40 rupees on a liter of pure milk
 thanda karne, prasanskaran, packaging or aisi hi prakriyaaon se guzarate hue kai paaydaanon ke baad yah doodh kareeb 48 rupye prati litre (or usase bhi zyada) keemat par gharon main aata he
 Given the huge amount of milk sold daily, the profits from adulteration can be tremendous
 aisi hi ek sheet ikai main kaam kar chukne kaa daawa karne vaala muraina kaa ek noujvaan kahata he, ''kachche doodh ke har 100 litre main (sheet sanyantron main doodh main milawat karne vaale log) kareeb do litre rifind tel, 200 gram disergent, 50 gram chuunaa or 30 litre pani milaate hai
 "it is an investment of about 200 rupees
" is puri milawat ke baad har 100 litre shuddh se kareeb 150 litre 'synthetic doodh' taiyaar hota he, jisaki kul laagat aati he 4,200 rupye
 Considering the cost of around Rs 6,000 on 150 liters of pure milk, it means a profit of Rs 1,800, or Rs 18 per liter, for every 100 liters of pure milk — that is, about 50 per cent
 madhya pradesh ke swasthya mantri tulsi silavat kehete hai, ''kendriya vigyaan or praudyogiki mantralay kii ek report main bataaya gaya tha ki desh main bechaa ja rahaa 68
 7% milk is adulterated, which is very large
 2017-18 main desh bhar main prati vyakti 375 gram doodh uplabdh tha jabaki prati vyakti khapat 480 gram thi
 "it is clear from these figures that the additional demand is being met with synthetic milk
" yah avaidh or beyimaani kii kamai mahaj doodh tak simit nahin he
 There are also adulterated forms of dairy products like mawa and paneer, which are made using this 'synthetic milk'
 doodh kii tarah in utpaadon kii maang bhi tyohaari sijan main bad jaati he, jiske chalate banpar munaafe kii fasal kaati jaati he
 In fact, the business of adulteration in dairy products is so blatant that Gwalior is full of stories of people who once sold milk on bicycles and later set up their own cold plants — and now roam in expensive cars
 achaanak maldaar hue logon kii in kahaniyon ke maddenjar bataaya jaataa he ki iskar mahakama bhi in ilaakon kii sheet ikaayiyon ke pichley kuch saal ke ritern kii nae sire se jaanch kar rahaa he
 The second aspect is undoubtedly the harm caused by such adulterated milk and dairy products
 inamen jo chijen milaai jaati hai, unke bahut aasaani se jahrile nattejey ho sakate hai, doodh se phydemand protein ke nikal jane kii to baat hi chhod den
 Well-known gastroenterologist Dr
 C
 of Bhopal si
 "caustic soda is an alkaline compound that can cause ulcers, wounds in the digestive tract, and even liver cancer," says Chaubal
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki shampoo or disergent liver or kidney ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 The big problem is that the consumption of adulterated milk can cause problems in the body after a very long time and by then the body has already suffered a lot
 sarkari karrwijulai ke ant main estf kii chhapemari ke baad, madhya pradesh sarkaar ne teji se karrwai kii
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath directed the officers to apply Rasuka in such cases
 19 agast ko, rajya mantrimandal ne milawat ke khilaaf apane sangharsh ke sankalp ko doharaaya or 'shuddh ke liye yuddh' kaa naaraa diya he
 Since the raids in Bhind and Morena, the state police registered a case against 57 people under sections 51 and 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA) 2006, as well as sections 272, 273, 420 and 120B of the IPC
 Have done
 estf ke atirikt mahanideshak ashok avasthi kehete hai, ''ham in chemicals ke aapurtikartaaon ko bhi nahin bakhshane vaale hai
 However, there are many problems at the government level as well which lead to delays or hurdles in such investigations
 inamen se ek he khaadya suraksha adhikariyon (effesao) kii sankhya
 The FSO has 275 sanctioned posts in the state but 122 of these are vacant
 haalanki sarkaar 85 or effesao kii bhartee karegi, lekin isamen samay lagegaa
 The second hitch is that there is only one food-testing laboratory in Bhopal in the state, which can conduct only 6,000 tests per year
 is chhapemari ke baad, jo july ke antim saptaah main shuru hui thi, 3,200 namoonay jaanch ke liye bhopal bheje ja chuke hai, lekin karmchaariyon kii kami se jujh rahi is prayogshaala main bhi namoonon kaa ambara khadaa hota ja rahaa he
 It takes an average of 10 hours to test a sample
 6 agast tak, keval 428 namoonon kaa pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 Of these, 139 were found to be substandard, 22 were inappropriate, eight were unsafe, three were found to contain banned elements and nine were adulterated
 in namoonon main uria, kitnashak, boric acid or disergent kii milawat pai gai he
 To reduce the burden on this lab, the state government has announced to set up new labs in Gwalior, Jabalpur and Indore and recruitment will also be started on existing vacancies
 ek or samasya kanoon se judi he
 STF SP Amit Singh says, "under FSSA, the police does not have the right to enter the food production complex - only officers of the food department can go
" ethese main dandatmak praavdhaan bhi hai to jurmaane kaa praavdhaan bhi he, jo logon ko aksar shinkaje se nikal jane main sakasham banaata he
 The state government is also exploring new avenues regarding this issue
 rajya ke swasthya mantri silavat ne kaha, ''sarkaar khaadya milawat main doshiyon ko aaajeevan karawas dene ke praavdhaan par kaam kar rahi he
 This is not only for adulterating milk — also for those who use chemicals to cook fruits fast
 '' teesri pareshaani rajya kii bhugolic sthiti se sambandhit he
 Five states share boundaries with Madhya Pradesh, all of which have different laws to deal with food adulteration
 rajya kii seemaa ke khuli hone se milavatkhoron ko mauka mil jaataa he
 Pallavi Jain Govil, Additional Principal Secretary, Health Department, says, "awareness is very important in this fight
 swasthya vibhaag ke alaava, police or nagar nigam ke adhikari milavati utpaadon ke bare main jaankaree hasil karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 However, there are doubts about the government's stated intentions when it comes to know that the transfer of food department officials in Bhind and Morena is rare
 yahaan tak ki sarkaar ke badal jane par bhi is vibhaag main tabadale bamushkil hi hote hai
 Most of the food inspectors are local and they remain frozen in one place due to the nexus of power
 kabhi-kabhaar rasmi taur par ve apana tabadalaa paas ke shaharon main kara lete hai taaki unke record main yah darj na hone paae ki ve ek hi sthaan par jarurat se zyada samay ke liye tainaat rahe hai
 Food inspector service records in Bhind and Morena make it clear that the same people have been posted to the offices
 haalanki, sheet sanyantron ke maalikon kaa tark he ki is mudde ko jarurat se zyada bada karke pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Ram Naresh Sharma of Maa Vaishnav Milling Center in Ambah says, "it is being said that crores are being made
" bamushkil 20 paise prati litre kaa margin he—lekin doodh kii keemat 40 ru
 Per liter and daily consumption is in millions of liters, so the business goes into crores
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ki namoonon main aksar us sabun kii maatra pai jaati he jo bhandaaran ke liye contenron ko dhone ke dauraan bartan main laga rah jaataa he
 "it is not appropriate to add anything to milk, but if milk does not meet fat standards, owners of many cold plants mix harmless skimmed milk powder in it," he argues
 vasa kii kami kabhi-kabhaar kuch khaas mausamon main yaa phir deyari pashu ke aahaar kii vajah se ho jaati he

 bhartiya havers Facebook se bounty kamaane main top par hai
 Bounties worth crores of rupees are awarded to Indian hackers
 darasal Facebook jaisi tech companiyaan bag bounty program chalaati hai jiske tahat lupahole yani khami, jise bag bhi kah len, dhundne par inaam die jate hai
 Recently Facebook has increased the bug bounty for account takeovers
 tamilnadu ke lakshmana muthaiya naam ke ek computer science ke student ne Instagram kii ek badi khami ujagar kii he
 An Instagram account could be hacked under this flaw
 iske liye yujar ke concent kii jarurat nahin thi
 Facebook and Instagram corrected the drawback and Laxman received a reward of $ 30,000 (approximately 20) from Facebook
 56 lakh rupee) die hai
 According to Laxman, he has found a bug in Instagram which is in the way of resetting the password
 unhone kaha he ki wo is bag kii vajah se kisi bhi instagram acount ko hack kar sakate the
 Laxman Muthiah, 26 years old, has said in a conversation with Tech till date that he started focusing on bug bounty from 2013
 2015 main kuch safaltaaen bhi mili hai
 Even before this, he had received a bounty of $ 10,000 from Facebook, when he found a bug looking at private photos
 unhone kaha he ki security research unke kaam kaa hissaa he or wo software development kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Laxman has said, 'I tried to reset the password through Instagram web interface, but here Facebook uses link based password reset option which is quite strong
 isamen mujhe koi bag nahin mila
 After that i tried mobile recovery mode
 yahaan mujhe khami mili, kyonki yahaan recovery ke liye wo (instagram) chah disit kaa code bhejte hai jo yujar ke mobile number par aata he
 There is always an option in the six digit code password reset system that the password of any account can be changed if you try 10 lakh codes at the verification endpoint
 lekin lakshmana kaa kahana he ki unhen ye pataa tha ki Brute Force atake se bachane k liye 6 disit ke code main rate limiting system lagaaya gaya hoga
 According to Laxman, he sent around 1000 requests to test it, out of which 250 requests went, but out of these 650 requests were limited
 iske baad bhi unhone tri kiya, lekin safal nahin hue
 He noticed a flaw here
 wo ye ki chaahe kitni baar bhi request bhejein, lekin block nahin hue
 He continuously sent requests without being blocked
 yaheen Instagram kii khami kaa unhen ahsaas hua, kyonki wo rate limiting ko bypass karne main safal ho rahe the
 Race Hazard and IP Rotation were responsible for this bypass
 is atake ke liye unhone hajaar se bhi zyada ypi kaa istemaal kiya he
 Because of constantly requesting requests from different ips, they kept on getting limited
 Race Hazard ke bare main agar aapako nahin pataa to bataa den ki ye ek tarah kaa electronic proces he
 Simply put, this Race Hazard is created when massive data is read and written at the same time and the machine overwrites the old data with the new one, but the old data can be read in the meantime
 Would have been aamtaur par is dauraan computer krash kaa notification miltaa he
 The race condition or race hedge may also occur during the instruction process in the wrong order
 agar ye sab turm aapke liye zyada technical ho rahaa he to sidhe taur par ye samaj len ki lakshmana ne Instagram mobile password riset karne ke tareeke main bag dhundha he or lagaataar atempt karke wo password riset karne main safal ho gaye
 He informed this to Facebook
 lekin jaankaree puri na hone kii vajah se Facebook ne shuruyaat main nahin mana, lekin baad main kuch imels or bheje or iske saath pruf of concept dekar is yuvak ne Facebook ko is baat kaa yakeen karaayaa ki Instagram main khami he
 Laxman says that in Real Attack Synerio, the attacker needs 5000 IP to hack an account
 ye badi baat he, lekin dekha jaae to ye aasaan bhi he, kyonki aisa karne ke liye aap amejon or google ke cloud sarvice kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Facebook soon fixed it and a reward of $ 30,000 was given under the bounty

 There is doubt about Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra contesting from Varanasi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf priyanka ke chunaav ladane par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne vito laga diya he
 According to Rahul, the tradition is to Nehru, Shastri and Indira not to try to forcefully defeat the big opposition leaders, that they should win and come to Parliament, this will keep democracy strong and healthy
 rahul gandhi kaa maananaa he ki rajeev gandhi ke vakt hemavathi nandan bahuguna ko amitabh bachchan se harwakar galat parampara daali gai
 At that time it happened in some other place, but in 1989 and 1991, Rajivji also kept changing the tradition
 rahul ne jawahar laal nehru ke lohia or atal prem kaa hawala diya
 Priyanka, who wants to surround Modi by contesting elections from Varanasi, agreed with Rahul, but said that Modi talks about Congress-free India, considers political opponents as personal enemies, wants to crush ideological differences, They are not Atal or Lohia, so they should be surrounded in Benares
 vahiin, rahul kaa maananaa he ki modi kii apni raajnneeti he, hamako usee raste par nahin chalanaa
 He kept talking about Congress-free India, what happened? We do not give a slogan of BJP free or anti free India
 hamako apane siyaasi mulyon ko nahin chhodana chahie
 Now the final decision on this issue is to be taken by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka together
 jaldi hi teenon ek saath baithak karke faisla kar lenge
 Sonia Gandhi will take final decision, after Congress President Rahul Gandhi's stand, Priyanka's chances of contesting from Varanasi have reduced
 haalanki, khud priyanka abhi bhi modi ko chunauti dene ko bekaraar hai
 Those research, survey, political equations are all adding up
 ab faisla sonia ko lenaa he, lekin rahul kaa vito kaaphi kuch kahata he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Priyanka in Rae Bareli, in response to the question of fighting Varanasi, said that she is ready, but the party has not taken any decision yet, the party will do what it says

 unhone likhaa, 'meraa vistaarit parivaar (phans) mujhe plateform par bad rahe troling ko lekar aagaah karata he or main jo kuch bhi soshal media par kah saktaa hum, usase saavdhaan rahane ke liye kahata he

 If your car or bike is damaged due to rain water, then the company will have to repair your car for free
 haalanki iske liye yah jaruri he ki aapaki car yaa bike under varantee ho
 Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra says that the manufacturing company cannot refuse to repair under-warranty cars or bikes by calling the rain an Act of God, a natural disaster
 unka kahana he ki barish har saal hoti he, yah koi act of god nahin he
 The company can deny repair of an under warranty vehicle only on the Act of God
 agar company barish main kharaab hui under varantee car yaa bike ko muft main repere karne se manaa karti hai, to unke khilaaf kanjumar court main cese kiya ja saktaa he
 In 2017, a consumer court in Delhi imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 on Maruti Suzuki in a similar case
 is maamle main balbir singh kii car ke ingine main barish kaa pani chalaa gaya tha, jiske chalate car main gadabadi aa gai thi
 At that time his car was in warranty period, but Maruti Suzuki refused to repair the car for free
 company kaa kahana tha ki balbir singh apni car ko jalairao vaale ilaake main lekar gaye or unki laaparvaahee se gaadi main kharabi ai he
 Therefore, he (the company) is not responsible for this
 iske baad balbir singh ne dilli kii kanjumar court main maaruti sujuki ke khilaaf cese kar diya tha
 After this, the Consumer Court said that it rains every year
 isko act of god nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Also, driving a car in a waterlogged area cannot be said to be negligent
 koi vyakti barish hone par raste main car chhodkar nahin aa saktaa he
 For this, the company should make arrangements so that even in the rainy season, the car does not get damaged
 agar gaadi main barish ke pani se nuksaan pahunchataa he, to menufactoring company car ko repere karne se inkaar nahin kar sakati he
 Let me tell you that there is no liability of the company for Act of God
 ise bhi padhein kaise kanjumar court main kiya ja saktaa he kesasupreme court ke edwocket upendra mishra ne bataaya ki agar kisi kii car yaa bike ko barish ke pani se nuksaan pahunchaa he or varantee khatm ho gai he, to vah insurance company se clem hasil kar saktaa he
 For this, it is necessary to have insurance for the safety of that car or bike
 yadi insurance companiyaan paisa dene se manaa karti hai, to irada yani insurance regulatory and deveopment athurity of india kaa rukh kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, if the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the decision of IRDA, then the consumer can approach the court

 ) Whether it is India or Pakistan, Kashmir has been an issue which all political parties want to capitalize on in terms of polarization of voters on both sides of the border
 lihaaja donon mulkon ke sabhi dalon ke ghoshnaptr main kashmir ke mudde ko hameshaa prathamikta di jaati rahi he
 In such a shocking news has come from the neighboring country of Pakistan, where the issue of Kashmir is almost missing in the manifesto of big political parties
 pakistan main 25 july ko hone vaale aam chunaavon ko lekar jahaan siyaasi sargarmi charam par he
 At the same time, all political parties have released their manifestos to woo the voters
 pakistani media reports ke mutabik yadi pakistan ke bade dal- pakistan muslim lig (navaj) yani piemail-en, pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) or pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke chunavi ghoshnaptr par nazar daale to kashmir kaa zikr nammaatr hi hua he
 Kashmir is mentioned only twice in the 58-page manifesto released on Monday by PTI, a former military cricketer, indirectly supported by the Pakistan Army, with an aggressive stance towards Kashmir
 chaar pramukh videshi muddon main kashmir tisare number par he
 The manifesto of Imran Khan's party talks of preparing a blueprint for resolving the Kashmir issue within the scope of the UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution
 ise padhein: Exclusive: bhutto ke baad ab sharif ko khatm karnaa chaahati he paak sena: hakkaanivahin pakistan ke sabase bade dal, purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii piemail-en ke ghoshnaptr main china ke saath najdiki ko praathamikta ke saath pakistan ke parmanu hathiyaaron kii suraksha ko praathamikta di gai he
 On the other hand, Kashmir has been ranked ninth in the ten-point agenda for improving foreign relations
 jabaki ghoshnaptr main kashmir, philistin va rohingya musalamaanon par ho rahe kathith atyaachaar par sahanubhuti jataai gai he
 At the same time, the PPP manifesto of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto advocated strengthening relations with India and continuing the round of negotiations
 62 pannon ke ghoshnaptr main kashmir kaa mudda 59wein pej par he 
 Therefore, the study of the manifesto of these three major parties of Pakistan shows that the three political parties want good relations with India
 kashmir mudde ko peeche chhodte hue bharat ke saath achche vyapaarik sambandh sthapit kerani chaahati he
 Now the question is, when Imran's PTI slogan is 'new Pakistan', is there no Kashmir in this new Pakistan of Imran Khan? Nawaz's party pml-n's slogan is 'respect the vote', so where is Nawaz's respect for Kashmir? The ppp's slogan is 'bibi promises to be kept, Pakistan is to be saved', so why does the declaration of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who talks about occupying Kashmir, insist on saving Pakistan instead of Kashmir? However, it is too early to say that Pakistan Has left the melody
 lekin is maheene ke ant main hone vaale aam chunaavon main bade siyaasi dalon ke ghoshnaptr se kashmir ke mudde kaa lagbhag gaayab hona is baat kii ore ishaara jarur karata he ki kashmir ke naam par ab pakistan main vot nahin milane vaale hai

 Bollywood actor Ayushmann Khurrana's film Bala has been super successful at the box office
 film abhi bhi screens par he or kamaal kaa bijness kar rahi he
 Meanwhile, an old video of him has gone viral on social media
 is video main shahrukh khan or shahid kapur ayushmaan khurana kii raging karte najar aa rahe hai
 The video is from the time when Ayushmann Khurranaki film Vicky Donor was released at the box office
 film ne dekhte hi dekhte kamyaabi ke jhande gadh die the
 In the video, Shah Rukh Khan and Shahid Kapoor continue to drag them out for a long time
 is baat par bahes karte rahete hai ki kis tarah new camers aakar industry main unke kaam ko prabhavit kar rahe hai
 Later, during the conversation, a bottle is brought to the stage and Ayushman Khurana is asked to speak a dialogue
 ayushmaan jab apni film kaa dialog bol rahe hote hai tabhi shahid unhen tokate hai or kehete hai ki shahrukh sar kii film kaa dialog bolo
 Ayushmann is interrupted when he is speaking the dialogues of Shahrukh Khan's film
 majaak main kiya gaya tha ye act-iske baad shahrukh khud apni film kaa dialog bolte hai
 Amidst the laughter and mockery, when Ayushmann is looking at the other side, Shahrukh kicks him with a glass bottle on his head
 act khatm hota he or shahrukh va shahid ye kehete hue ayushmaan ko stage se vidaa kar dete hai ki do saal tak industry main dikhaai mat dena
 Let me tell you that this whole act was done to make people laugh and there was no seriousness in it
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh dow
 Even though Harshvardhan is making a statement that Arvind Kejriwal should do anything, now he does not pay attention to his words
 wo kya karte hai, kahaan jate hai or kya kehete hai, ab isse bijepi ko koi matlab nahin he
 But the inside thing is that BJP in Delhi is scared of Kejriwal's phobia
 isiilie ab kejariwal par sau aarope lagane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The special thing is that this time the BJP is gathering evidence to make a hundred allegations
 iske liye akhabaaron kii kating, tivi channelon par prasaarit hui video footage or photo ikatthe kiye ja rahe hai
 The inside thing is that Harshvardhan has put his entire team to research Kejriwal's flaws
 isamen photo ke jariye kadiyaan jodi ja rahi hai ki kejariwal ke saath kitne suraksha karmi civil dress main chalate hai
 Which statement took u turn
 isaki audio or video clip nikaali ja rahi hai
 Which big names from the Aam Aadmi Party have left the party so far annoyed
 isaki bhi puri list nikaali ja rahi he
 By the way, it is also a matter of fact that the BJP had prepared for the 49-day 49 flop point, but Harshvardhan's research team got so much success that Kejriwal's list of more than 150 mistakes was made
 ab inhen shortlist karke 100 aaropon kii ek final list banaai ja rahi he
 See now when the BJP brings out this internal matter
 urisa sarkaar ne nan ko suraksha dene kaa vishwaas dete hue kaha ki vah balaatkaariyon ko pahchaanane main prashasan kii madad kare
 The nun in front of the media in New Delhi on Friday accused the Orissa government of not helping him
 urisa ke dijipi manmohan praharaj ne ek samachar channel ko kaha ki hamalogon ne use har sambhav suraksha diya he or unase kaha he ki vah hamaari thodi madad karen
 The state government said that we are ready to parade an identity of suspected rapists wherever the nuns wish and wherever they feel safe
 nan ne shuukravaar ko ek press conference main kaha tha ki unhen urisa sarkaar par vishwaas nahin he or chaahati he ki is aparaadh kii jaanch centre kare
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had rejected the petition of Cuttack Archbishop Rafael Chinath, in which he demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation investigation into the incident
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne buudhvaar ko kaha he ki peedit rajya sarkaar kii jaanch agency kii jaanch parade main aropiyon ko pahchaanane main madad kare
 Bhima Koregaonvince has filed an affidavit in the Maharashtra Government's Supreme Court on the arrest of leftist thinkers in the case a few days ago
 police ne sabhi paanch kaaryakartaaon kii giraftaar ko sahi tehraaya he
 In the affidavit, the Maharashtra government stated that all the 5 activists were planning to create chaos in the society
 ve hinsa ko ujagar karne ke liye bhayanak dizin kaa hissaa hai
 The Maharashtra government has said that the arrest of the activists has not been done on the basis of dissatisfaction or difference of opinion
 maharashtra police kii ore se kaha gaya ki sabhi 5 kaaryakartaaon ko vishwasaneey sakshya ke aadhaar par giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Maharashtra Police is still seeking the custody of all the activists
 sarvocch adaalat main guuruuvaar ko is maamle par sunwaayee hogi
 The government has said that even though the accused are not able to go anywhere from the house arrest, they can still erase the evidence
 vahiin duusare aropiyon ko bhi alert hone kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 If we get their custody, we can find out about the other accused as well
 court ne diya tha nazarband karne kaa aadeshdesh ke kai hisson main chhapemari kar police ne 5 vampanthi vichaarkon- sudhaa bharadwaj, varvara raav, gautam navalkha, arun ferera or vernon gonjalvis ko giraftaar kiya tha
 However, on the direction of the Supreme Court, the house arrest has been kept till September 6, prohibiting the arrest of all
 bijepi ne loksabhaa main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan prastaav kaa notice diya he

 is bare main unhone kaha ki unhone manmohan singh ke khilaaf 2008 ke vishwaas mat ke bare main vikiliks ke khulaase par unke bayaan ko lekar loksabhaa main visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice diya he
 "is BJP ready for war?" Both the concerned characters and Kiren Rijiju, the BJP leader, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju and the BJP national spokesperson, all insist that the government is committed to protecting the nation and fight terror for the first time
 Political determination is visible
 india today conklev ko sambodhit karte hue rigiju ne kaha ki kuchhek dukhad haadason ko chhod den to pichley paanch saal main desh main kahin bhi koi aatankwaadi hamalaa nahin hua he
 The character added that the Prime Minister's leadership in this proved to be decisive on all fronts
 khaas baterashtriya suraksha ke maamle main pradhanmantri ke netritv ne nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai he or pichley paanch saal main desh main koi bada aatankwaadi hamalaa nahin hua he
 The strategy that the government adopted for the northeast changed the area
 pehali baar sashastr balon or khufia agenciyon kaa saath dene, unka hausala badhaane kii rajnatik ichhashakti dikhaai di he
 Kiren Rijiju's position on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Northeast is not a matter of security or law and order, but a political matter
 logon ne jo virodh or gussa dikhaaya he, vah siyaasi he
 "related characters" Not that the army did not have a heart before, it did not have courage
 thal sena or vaayu sena sabake paas yah hausala pehle se tha, bas rajnatik ichhashakti kaa abhaav hua karata tha

 Premium charges apply !! It is reported that Irrfan Khan, who is going to be seen in a special role in Vishal Bhardwaj's next film Haider, has appealed to Vishal not to use his name, his face or his appearance in the film promotion
 sirf yahi nahin is nivedan ke saath vishaal se unhone yah bhi kah diya he ki film pramotion ke dauraan vah unase upasthit rahane kii apeksha na rakhen
 While Irfan has kept distance from the promotion of the film 'haider' inspired by the English writer William Shakespeare's play 'hamlet', social networking sites are leaving no stone unturned to promote the film
 irfan ke is kadam ko lekar aap soch main pad sakate hai
 In this regard, a close friend of Irfan says that this is not a strategy but a deliberate decision taken by Irfan
 irfan ne yah faisla kiya he ki vah kisi bhi film main tabhi mehmaan bhoomika nibhaayenge jab unhen na sirf saare pramotional activities se dur rakhaa jayega balki unka zikr kahin bhi naa kiya jayega
 Vishal and Irrfan have known each other for a long time, so Vishal has decided to do the same, respecting Irfan's decision
 expoj he vajah?film ‘expos’ main apane kadave anubhav ke aadhaar par philhal irfan is tarah kaa faisla lene ke liye majaboor hue hai
 a source close to Irrfan says that Irrfan played a minor role as a guest star in the film 'expose' and the makers also promised Irrfan to keep him away from the film promotion during that time
 lekin jab irfan ko pataa chalaa ki ‘expos’ ke mekars unka naam dhadlle se film pramotion main istemaal kar rahe hai to unhen jabardast jhatka laga
 Irrfan says Irfan has retained the same decision in view of Vishal's film Haider
 is silsile main khud irfan khan kaa kahana he, ‘’main hameshaa se vishaal kii filmon kaa prashansak rahaa hum so jab unhone mujhe ‘haidar’ main ek mehmaan bhoomika saunpi to main unhen inkaar na kar sakaa
 Frankly, ever since i worked in Shakespeare's literature film Maqbool, i wanted to work in a film made on some other work
 mujhe khushi he ki ‘haidar’ ne mujhe yah mauka diya lekin main apane film pramotion se dur rahane ke faisle par kaayam hum

 On Monday, on the issue of another BSP leader Brijesh Pathak joining BJP after leaving the BSP, Swamy said that after me and RK Chaudhary left the party, Brijesh Pathak has also left BSP, because Mayawati does not remember the social change of Kashiram anymore and Neither do the workers remember the self-respect, they only remember the vault and the money
 swami ne kaha ki upi main bijepi keenai andheechal gai he, is aandhi main congress sapa or basapa keparakhccheud jaaenge, bijepi 300 seat laakar sabhi partiyon kaa supada saaf kar degi
 He said that there are many such workers in BSP who have been associated with the party for the last 25-30 years but now they are getting humiliated
 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay desh kii jitani pratishthit uniwarsity he, utane hi lokapriy uske tamaam pratik bhi hai
 JNU has a special identity on the right of the Ganga Dhaba as soon as it enters JNU, but these days there is a fight in JNU
 lij ho chuki he khatmganga dhabas ke saamne amumanjeeneuke chaatr chaay kii chuskiyaan lete hai or charchaa karte hai
 But the reason for raising slogans these days is the notice of the JNU administration that has asked to return the Ganga Dhaba
 darasal jeenyu prashasan ne vartmaan main ganga dhabas ko chalaa rahe susheel rathi ko dhaba khaali karne kaa notice diya he taaki nayaa tender jari kiya ja sake
 Sushil Rathi's lease in 2013 has ended
 ab jeenyu prashasan yahaan fresh tender jari karnaa chahta he, jiske liye dhaba khaali karnaa hoga
 Students are protesting; On the other hand, students opposing this notice say that the administration wants to end jnu's debate culture
 isliye pehle se maujuud pratikon ko khatm kar rahaa he
 The students allege that it will be taken a long time in the name of fresh tender and then the Ganga Dhaba will be closed, hence the students are opposing this decree
 prashasan kii niyat par uthaae sawaljaahir he ek taraf prashasan kah rahaa he ki ye sirf fresh tender kii prakriya he, joki 2013 main hi honi thi magar nahin hui
 On the other hand, student organizations say that the intention of the administration is not clear and it wants to close the dhaba
 viraat brigade ke saamne south africa main 25 saal se test siries na jeet paane ke sookhe ko khatm karne kii chunauti he
 Team India is ready to play two hands in the first Test starting on Friday
 match bhartiya samyaanusaar dopaher do baje shuru hoga
 India has a poor record in South Africa, where they have lost 5 out of 6 series, with one draw
 bharat ne 1992 se dakshin africa kii sarajameen par khele 17 test main se sirf do main jeet darj kii he
 The team recorded one win in 2006-07 under the leadership of Rahul Dravid and one in 2010-11 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 bharat ne haalanki pichley do dauron par dakshin africa main behatar pradarshan kiya he
 The team drew the series in 2010–11, while in 2013–14 it faced defeat despite giving it a tough competition
 bharat kii 2013-14 team ke 13 khilaadi maujuuda team ke sadsy hai, jo kaaphi anubhav hasil kar chuki he or jeet darj kar rahi he
 Virat Brigade, to mark the stamp of 'home lions, heaps abroad' is a question of the venue, the Indian team could never win in 4 Tests at Newlands and lost two matches in the meantime
 Two matches were drawn
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki kohli kii team ek kadam aage bad paati he yaa nahin, jo mehmaan captain kaa dakshin africa sarajameen par sirf teesraa test hoga
 1 day to go

 com / 3wkss7r0c5— BCCI (@bcci)january 4, 2018is baar bharat kaa tej gendbaaji akraman majboot he, jo kisi bhi ballebaaji kram ko dhwast karne main sakasham he
 Despite the drought conditions here, New Zealand's wicket remains the center of attention
 pehle test ke wicket ko dekhte hue bharat kam se kam teen gendbaajon ke saath utrega or aise main bhubaneshwar kumaar, eshanth sharma or mohammad shami ko mauka milane kii sambhaavna he
 Ravidra Jadeja's playing is questionable due to viral illness and this reinforces Ravichandran Ashwin's claim to be the only spinner in the playing XI
 bharat form main chal rahe rohit sharma ke rup main atirikt ballebaaj ke saath utar saktaa he, jabaki hardik pandya ko alrounder ke rup main mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Chances of change in India's batting order are extremely slim
 salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan feet ghoshit ho chuke hai or vah murali vijay ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne ke liye pehle vikalp honge
 Lokesh Rahul will have to sit outside like this
 ‘dakshin africa main pasinaa-pasinaa team india, par nahaane par bhi bandish! jaaniye kyunup captain ajinkya rahane kharaab form se jujh rahe hai, lekin iske baavjood videshi abhiyaan ke pehle hi match main unhen baahar kiye jane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Rohit was not part of the Kolkata Test against Sri Lanka, when India last played on the Ghasiyali pitch
 lekin iske baad unhone sabhi praroopon main teen shatak ke saath apana daawa majboot kiya he
 Like India, there is nothing clear about the selection in the South African team
 del sten ko feet ghoshit kiya gaya he, lekin is tej gendbaaj kaa khelnaa tay nahin he
 The hosts have been landing for a while with a combination of 3 fast bowlers and a spinner, with left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj supporting the fast bowlers
 timen is prakaar hai- bharat: viraat kohli (captain), shikhar dhawan, murali vijay, lokesh rahul, cheteshwar pujaara, ajinkya rahane, rohit sharma, riddhimaan saaha, hardik pandya, aar aswin, ravindra jadeja, bhubaneshwar kumaar, eshanth sharma, umesh yadav, mohammad shami, jasprit bumraah or parthiv patel main se
 South Africa: Faf du Plessis (captain), Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Thunis de Bruen, Quinton Dickock, Keshav Maharaj, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Chris Morris, Vernon Philander, Cagiso Rabada and Andile Fehlukwao
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko varanasi main namakan daakhil kar diya
 If Modi manages to become Prime Minister, he will be the first Prime Minister to face 77 candidates in the election race
 modi ke khilaaf 77 ummidavaaron ko raajnneetik sameekshak virodhiyon dwaara unke khilaaf phenke gaye antim paase ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh became Prime Minister in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections
 unhen chunaav main 17 pratyaashiyon se hi muqabla karnaa padaa tha
 At that time there was a storm of the Mandal Commission, but the government could not complete its tenure and Chandrashekhar Singh took over as the Prime Minister
 chandrashekhar ke khilaaf baliya seat se 13 ummidavaaron ne taal thonki thi
 P
 in the year 1991
 ve
 Narasimha Rao had also reached the Seven Race Course Road, struggling with just 13 candidates
 varsh 1996 main lakhanu seat se purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko 58 ummidavaaron, varsh 1998 main 13 va varsh 1999 ke chunaav main 14 raajnneetik pratidwandviyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Modi will not only have to grapple with the highest number of 77 candidates so far in the Varanasi seat, but he will also have the responsibility of saving the socio-cultural fabric that was tried to show during his nomination
 raajnneetik vishleshak va pandit madanamohan malviya patrakarita santhaan ke nideshak pro omprakash singh kehete hai ki chunaav ke antim charan main virdohi dalon ne modi ko gherne kaa yah antim prayaas kiya he
 Every single vote saved by BJP and Modi is trying to scatter, or rather it is a form of proxy disguise
 namakan main vibhinn pradesh ke logon ne modi kaa swaagat apni paaramparik veshbhusha main kiya
 According to the bjp's strategy, Modi also greeted him in his language, but now the opposition parties are trying to answer him according to the preparations of the BJP
 haryana ke sanjay vashishtha brahmacharee, madhya pradesh ke mahendra bhai dikshit, patna ke haziz meraaj khalid nur, kerala ke isai samudaay se jude johnson thomas, jharkhand ke prakaash pratap, rajasthan ke narendra sharma, kolkata ke shivahari agarwal jaise log varanasi ke chunavi samar main pratyaashee ke rup main saamne hai
 This is the reason that it is believed that the candidates of these states will connect themselves with the voters of Benaras
 modi ke prabhaav ko kam karne kii koshish karenge
 Political analyst Rajneesh Shukla and Kaushal Kishore say that people of Haryana, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and other states also live in Varanasi
 bijepi in matadaataaon ko sahejane kii koshish kar rahi he lekin raajnneetik virdohi ise baantne kii koshish main jute hai
 BSP supremo Mayawati addressed an election rally in Ghaziabad on Tuesday
 mayawati ne logon se congress-sapa gathbandhan or bhaajapa ko apana vot naa dene kii apil kii
 He said that the painful incident of Dadri happened here, Bulandshahr incident happened, there is a lot of fear in the minds of these SP government
 mayawati ne kaha ki sapa sarkaar vikaas or janhit ke jo kaam gina rahi he, wo basapa sarkaar main hi puure kar die gaye the
 The SP government has made the condition of all classes worse
 congress or bhaajapa ne bhi apane raajnneetik swaarth ke liye apni jimmedaari nahin nibhaai
 Taking a dig at the SP, Mayawati said that Akhilesh and Mulayam's camp will try to defeat each other
 agar aap inhen vot dete hanto vot kaa nuksaan hogaakyonki isse bijepi ko phayda ko hoga, isliye apana vot basapa ko hi den
 Even on the decision of demonetisation, Mayawati tried to surround the BJP
 unhone kaha ki upi main bijepi kii sarkaar aate hi yahaan garibon kii haalat kharaab ho jaaegi
 At the Ghaziabad rally, Mayawati fiercely targeted the opposition parties
 mayawati ke bhaashan kii mukhya baaten:1
 There is resentment among the public against the decisions of farmers, workers, businessmen and all sections of the people in the sp's five years and the Modi government at the center for the last three years
 2
 BJP could not present the face of the Chief Minister in the state
 daagi chahare ke saath congress ne gathbandhan kiya he
 Congress has ruled in UP and Center for many years, but now Congress is contesting elections in association with a party which is known for Jungle Raj
 3
 The present SP government is a government with anarchy, corruption, hooliganism, communal riots, women oppression and jungle raj
 inke shasankaal main mujffarnagar samet 500 chote-bade dange hue
 Traumatic incident in Dadri, policemen died in Mathura, gangrape in Bulandshahr
 4
 Crores of rupees were spent on the promotion of half-finished work of development
 is apaar dhan ko garibon ke liye kharch kiya ja saktaa tha
 5
 sapa ne bispi ke shashan main hue kaamon kaa naam chaalaaki se badla
 Mulayam Singh has insulted his brother Shivpal in son Moh, because of this Shivpal and his people will work to defeat the other camp inside
 inkaa base vot bhi do khemo main bant jayega
 If the people of the minority community give it to the SP, then their vote will go in vain and BJP will directly benefit
 isliye alpsankhyak samaaj ko apana vot unki ekmaatr hitaishi party bispi ko dena chahie
 BJP cannot win at any cost due to bsp's minority vote addition
 6
 The BJP had promised to give 15 lakhs to everyone by bringing black money from abroad
 karj main duube kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 This time, an attempt is being made to capitalize on these promises
 centre main sarkaar bane itnaa samay biit gaya
 The poor did not get even one rupee nor was the debt of the farmers forgiven
 7
 Not even a quarter of the work was completed by demonetisation
 logon kogumraah karne ke liye naatakabaaji kii he
 Connected with the national interest and made demonetisation and this decision was going to hurt the public
 is faisle se 90 fisadi garib log ubar nahin paae he or kai log berozegaar ho gaye hai
 8
 bijepi or piem modi ne notebandi ke faisle se pehle 10 maheene pehle hi apane netaaon or bade puunjipatiyon kaa kalaadhan thikaane laga diya tha
 The decision of demonetisation was made to share political benefits and public attention
 bijepi ne lalit modi or vijay maalya jaise logon ko bachaaya
 9
 bijepi sarkaar main desh bhar main dalit utpeedan kii kai ghatnaayen huin
 The BJP is also taking forward the RSS agenda to eliminate and nullify the reservations found in the Constitution
 daliton par atyaachaar badha he
 10
 baba sahab ambedkar ji ke naam par smarak or kuch maukon par inkaa naam lene se or congress kii tarah daliton ke ghar jaakar khaanaa khaane se is samaaj kaa pichhadaapan dur hone vaala nahin he
 The sympathy of Modi ji will not work but the people of the society want action against the accused
 11
 The status of being a minority is being taken away
 tripal talaak or civil code se hamaari party sahamat nahin he
 These people are concerned about the safety of property and religion
 deshbhakti, lav-jehad, gauraksha ke naam par in logon kaa shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Fear prevails in many sections of society
 12
 Like Congress, poor people are upset due to wrong policies of BJP
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ne vikaas kii bajaae aresas ke agenda par sampradayik takaton ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya he
 13
 centre sarkaar jab dilli kii kanoon vyavastha ko nahi sambhaal sakati he to dilli se bhi badi aabaadi vaale upi ko kaise sanbhaalegi
 14
 vipakshi dal sam, daam, dand, bhed se chunaav ladate hai
 Media is being managed by the opponents
 lekin upi kii janata jabardastee kii hawa banane se bhi gumraah nahi hogi or bispi kii sarkaar banane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 15
 opinian pole main bispi ko kam aanka ja rahaa he
 Even in the 2007 assembly elections, media and opinion polls showed the BSP at number three and four, but after the results, the opinion poll was exposed
 upi main virdohi partiyon kii haalat kharaab he
 The BJP did not fulfill the Lok Sabha's election promises
 notebandi se log dukhi he or sapa ke gunda raaj se janata dukhi he, iske baavjood media or oponian pole in partiyon ko aage dikhaa rahe hai
 It is all managed
 16
 The public does not want to get caught in the survey and opinion poll
 janata ko saavdhaanee baratani chahie, thodi bhi chook kar di to sapa yaa bijepi kii sarkaar ban sakati he or tab logon kii pidaa bad jaaegi
 17
 baba sahab ke athak prayaason se mili aarakshan jaisi suvidhaon khatm karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The BJP and the central government will end facilities like reservation by following the agenda of RSS
 18
 Seeing the crowd at the BSP rally, it is clear that BSP alone is going to form the government with absolute majority
 ise bijepi ne bhi sweekaar kar liya he, bijepi duusare or tisare number par aane ke liye chunaav lard rahi he
 19
 bispi sarkaar aane par ganna kisaanon ko uchit daam or vyapaariyon ko suraksha di jaaegi
 Traders do not feel safe in SP government
 bispi sarkaar main vyapaariyon kii suraksha or samasyaon ke liye alag se vibhaag banaaya jayega
 Our government will give leases of government land to the poor
 sapa sarkaar main jin logon ne jameenon par kabja kiya he unako sookhaa nahi choda jayega
 This time the idol etc
 will not be installed
 sarkaar pradesh ko surakshit or viksit karne ke kaam karegi
 20
 hamaari sarkaar main janhit or janakalyaan kii sabhi yojanaon ko phir se lagu kiya jayega jo band kii gai hai
 The names that SP has changed will be reinstated
 ham upi main garibon ko aarthik madad denge
 Cheap ration and cheap electricity will be provided
 skulon main baccho ko doodh biscuit, chanaa fal aadi die jaaengen
 The poor will be helped by small loans
 ek lakh rupee tak ke sabhi karje maaf kiye jaaenge

 a rap song has been prepared to spread awareness about the need for safe sex, which was released on Thursday on the occasion of World Population Day
 ek bayaan main kaha gaya, papulation foundation of india (piefai) or kaarykram 'main kuch bhi kar sakati hum' ke nirmaataaon ne is geet ko relies kiya jiskaa sheershak 'condom rap' he jise piyush kanaujia ne banaaya he
 Launched under the hashtag 'condom Bole' campaign, the song will promote the use of condoms, with a message in mind that young people, especially men, need safe sex, dual safety and their responsibility in family planning
 piefai kii kaaryakari nideshak punam mutereja ne kaha, "garbhanirodh ke bare main nirnay saamaajik mandandon ke saath behad kareeb se jude hue hai or yugal apane parivaar va samaaj se apni prajnan kshamta ko sabit karne ke liye kaaphi dabaav kaa saamana karte hai

 Something similar will be seen in upcoming films Ready, Singam, Force, Bodyguard and Kick
 in filmon kii khaas baat yah he ki ye sabhi dakshin bhartiya filmon kaa rimek hai
 Of course these films also intend to raise the flag of success just like films like Ghajini and Wanted
 south ke rimek ke is rujhaan par film vishleshak komal nahata kehete hai, ''saalon se rimek banate aae hai
 But the good trend is that these films are being liked and movies are being made only after buying rights
 ''wonted ke saath darshakon ke dilon main jabardast dastak de chuke salmaan khan ek baar phir se kai rimek filmon main najar aaenge
 His film Ready, released in June, is a remake of a Telugu film with the same name and the same can be said about Bodyguard (malayalam) and Kick (telugu)
 haalanki salmaan ise mahaj ittefaq bataate hai, ''bollywood main behtareen lekhak maujuud hai
 It is a coincidence that i am doing south based films
 '' vahiin, nirdeshak anis badgami film ko puri tarah se bollywood ke rang main rangane kii baat kehete hai
 a song from the film Dhinka Chika is composed on the lines of Ringa Ringa of the Telugu film Arya 2
 dekhne vaali baat yah he ki dabang ke baad sallu miyaan kii yah pehali film he
 In this case, when it comes to the promotion of the film, it is completely seen on Salman's shoulders
 yahi nahin, unki agast main relies ho rahi bodyguard ke malayalam sanskaran main dilip or nayantara mukhya bhoomikaaon main the jabaki isamen nayika hai karina kapur
 The funny thing is that Siddiqui, who directed the original Malayalam, is in charge of directing its Hindi version, while Kick will be directed by Shirish Kunder and it is being said that the film could be made in 3D

 priyanka assam tourism deveopment corporation (ATDC) kii brands ambesder hai
 Recently a calendar was launched with his photos to promote tourism
 calendar ke launch hone ke baad priyanka ke kapadon ko lekar vivaad shuru ho gaya
 The Congress said it was against Assamese culture
 saport main utre ectorpub is vivaad main assam ke kai mashhoor actors ne priyanka chopra kaa saport kiya he
 Actor Devoleena says that i do not want to accuse anyone
 bataur actress mujhe maaloom he ham stars vahi kapade pahante hai jo creative team hamaare liye final karti he
 In such a situation, it is not right to target any one
 assam kii senior actor parinita kaa kahana he ki calendar main aisi tasviir nahin he jo sabhyataa ke liye sammanjanak nahin ho
 Priyanka is wearing a traditional Assam hat
 jo assam kii samskruti ko darshata he
 The clothes that the actress has worn are also normal
 phir is baat kaa par itnaa vivaad kyon banaaya ja rahaa he
 Priyanka's photo in the calendar Against Assamese culture, the Congress said- remove, on the calendar photo, the Congress said that Priyanka has worn very small clothes, it does not reflect our civilization
 aise main priyanka ko ambesder pad se hataa dena chahie
 Boko MLA Nandita Das and MLA Roopjyoti have demanded the removal of Priyanka
 report ke mutabik congress vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki priyanka ne calendar main frock pahani he
 This is not an Assamese culture dress
 sarkaar ko hamaari parampara or sabhyataa kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 MLA Roopjyoti said, "there is a need to make Priyanka Chopra an ambassador in Assam too
 What is the need to make Priyanka Chopra an ambassador? In a statement to the Weekly Paper of Guwahati, ATDC Chairman Jayanta Malla Barua says that the calendar will promote Assam internationally Is made for ise interaneshal tour oparator or ganmaanya logon ko bheja chukaa he
 How can Narendra Modi government make its first anniversary celebration memorable? This question is puzzling in view of farmers' suicides, falling stock markets, industries scared of tax notices and the invading opposition, but in fact, there are opportunities to recover where Modi is stuck
 yah avasar krishi va gramin arthvyavastha main bade or nirnaayak sudhaar shuru karne kaa he
 Which are not only pending and mandatory since the beginning of economic reforms, but they are also heavily responsible for the political future of BJP
 satta main aane ke baad modi sarkaar gaanv va kheti kii hakeekat se talmail nahin baitha saki
 In the last kharif half a dozen states had a drought
 farvari main krishi mantralay ne maan liya ki sukhi kharif or rabi kii buvaai main kami se anaaj utpaadan teen saal ke sabase nichle str par rah saktaa he
 The farmer suicide figure reached 1,400 last November
 lekin do bajaton main bhi kheti ko lekar gambhirtha nahin dikhi
 In March this year, when the Prime Minister was persuading the cultivators on land acquisition by saying 'mann ki Baat', by then the second round of eating poison of farmers had started
 agar twarit garibi naapane kaa koi tarika ho to yah jaananaa mushkil nahin he ki mausami kahar se 189 lakh hectayar ilaake main rabi fasal kii barbaadi ke baad desh kii ek badi aabaadi achaanak garibi kii rekha se neeche chali gai he
 On this occasion, the government's much publicized Jan Dhan, Adarsh gram or Direct Cash Transfer schemes did not help as these schemes did not deal with the reality of the rural economy
 taaja krishi sankat 2009 se zyada chunauteepurn ho saktaa he kyonki lagaataar do fasalein bighad chuki hai or teesri fasal par kharaab monsoon kaa khauf mandara rahaa he
 Employment generation has come down to a minimum level under MNREGA in the villages and the supply of employment in the city has come to a complete standstill
 isliye sirf kheti nahin balki puri gramin arthvyavastha ko ubaarane kii chunauti he jo darasal ek avasar bhi he
 Indian farming is a unique story of neglect and inconsistency and success and prospects
 yadi pichhali kharif ko chhod den to 2009 ke baad se anaaj utpaadan or krishi niryaat lagataar badha he or gramin ilaakon kii maang ne mandi ke daur main automobile va upabhokta utpaada companiyon ko lanbaa sahaara diya he
 However, there are some basic problems of agriculture that emerge badly in a grim weather and suddenly make agriculture inferior
 ek ke baad ek ai sarkaron ne kheti ko kabhi nitiyon kaa ek sugathit aadhaar nahin diya
 Therefore, this business has always been in the realm of crisis management
 krishi kii buniyadi samasyaon ko sudhaarney ke safal prayog bhi hamaare irdagird faile hai or nitigat prayaason kii kami nahin he
 For example, the small size of land holdings is a permanent farming challenge that makes this business negligible in profit and large in risk
 farmar produsar companiyon main iskaa samaadhaan dikhaa he jinhen chote-chote kisaan milakar banaate hai or samuhik utpaadan karte hai
 The government had told the Lok Sabha last year that about 235 farmer producer companies have been registered in India and 370 are in the queue
 kareeb 4
 33 lakh farmers will be a part of it
 thik isi tarah bihar or madhya pradesh main anaaj va tilhan kii record upaj, uttar pradesh main doodh kii nai kranti, desh ke kai hisson main fal-sabji utpaadan ke nae kirtiman, gujarat main laghu sinchai kshetreey safaltaaen hai, jinhen rashtriya banaaya ja saktaa he
 Fertilizer subsidy reforms are ready
 sinchai pariyojnaayen prastaavit hai
 New research is going on but has to be activated
 nitiyaan maujuud hai
 Infrastructure is available
 inhen ek jagah sametakar bade sudhaaron main badla ja saktaa he
 The Modi government should take a major initiative for rural economic reforms, on which it will get support, as the state has become sensitive after the recent wastage of crops
 kai rajyon ko ehsaas he ki unki pragati kaa rasta kheton se hi nikalegaa kyonki unke paas udyog aasaani se nahin aaenge
 The Modi government can create a time-bound campaign of reforms on the lines of NITI Aayog or Make in India which will not make the mistake of making separate policies for farming and village but will open the way for overall reforms for the entire rural economy
 yakeenan, 125 karod logon kaa pet bharna kahin se nuksaan kaa dhandha nahin he or kareeb 83 karod log yani desh kii 70 fisad aabaadi kii kray shakti koi chota bazaar nahin he
 For Modi, worrying about the rural economy after coming to government was not only a matter of sensitivity or foresight, but he should also worry about the villages because his party has got enough votes in the villages for the first time, and seventy percent BJP MP rural Are from a background and their next political successes will depend on rural dominated states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 rahul gandhi par aap hans sakate hai lekin bhoomi adhigrahan par ve loksabhaa main modi ko jo rajnatik naseehat de rahe the, usamen dam tha
 The agrarian crisis and politics in India have deep ties
 2002 bharat main sabase bade sookhe kaa varsh tha
 The Vajpayee government could not reconcile itself to this crisis and remained in the field in the 2004 elections

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator On Sony tv's most popular show 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma', Dr
 hathi kaa dilachasp kirdaar nibhaane vaale kavi kumaar aaazaad kii maut ke baat laga tha ki ye sho apana aakarshan kho degaa
 But with the introduction of Nirmal Soni in the show, this show is still continuously entertaining the audience
 ye aisa kamedi se labalab sho he jise har umr ke log pasand karte hai
 This show is known for its interesting episodes
 sho main in dinon chal rahe trek ne logon ke liye hansi ke saath rochakata kaa ek nayaa pitara de diya he
 Actually, the 1 crore lottery ticket received by journalist Popatlal has added new interestingness to the show
 lottery kho gai he or use lekar gokuldham ke kirdaaron ne jo bhaagam bhaag machaa rakhi he, wo bahut mjedaar he
 These days, the track of the lottery ticket of 1 Korad is shown in the show these days
 gokuldham sosayadi lottery ke tikat ko dhundhane main lagi he
 Actually, Popatlal has borrowed Rs 2000 from the society's secretary Atmaram Tukaram Bhide
 udhari chukaane ke liye popatlal atm mashin se 5000 hajaar rupee nikaalte hai
 But when Popatlal withdraws the money and leaves for the house, that one man follows Popatlal with his wife
 popatlal se naaraaz ho gaye bhidepichha karne vaala admipopatlalase beti ke ilaaj ke liye 5000 rupee maangata he
 Popatlal does not believe his words
 paise dene se manaa bhi kar dete hai
 However, after seeing the medical report and talking to the doctor at the hospital, Potlal is convinced of his point
 or wo rupee bhi de dete hai
 In return for this help, the man gives a lottery ticket of 1 crore to Popatlal
 popatlal tikat lene se manaa karte hai, lekin wo donon jabardastee popatlal ko tikat de hi dete hai
 The Popatlal Society takes the ticket where their friends are waiting at Abdul's soda shop
 popatlal mandali ko puri kahani sunaate hai
 Atmaram gets angry at this and says that Popatlal does not want to give my money, hence making an excuse
 sosayadi ke log bhi popatlal kii baat par bharosa nahin karte
 But after this Popatlal shows Bhide the lottery ticket and says that i am not lying
 jab bhide tikat dekhtaa he to popatlal ko bolta he ki agar aisa he to main ab tikat tabhi duungaa jab wo mujhe paise waapas kar degaa
 During all this, the soda falls on Popatlal's shirt from Bhide's hand and Popatlal gets annoyed with the soda falling
 sari khinchataan ke baad bhide popatlal kii shart chamako londry main dene ke liye kahata he
 After this, all the people go to their home
 yahaan se shuru hua tarak mehta main twistakahani main twist yaheen se aata he
 When Popatlal is leaving for his work, he gets into a fight
 bhide paise waapas lautaane ke liye kahata he
 But Popatlal does not hear the whole thing in a hurry and leaves in a hurry
 baad main bhide, popatlal ko lottery kaa tikat sabhal kar rakhane ke liye phone bhi karata he
 Popatlal does not listen to the clash
 agle din popatlal apni shart londry ke liye de detaa he
 a lottery ticket by mistake also goes in the same shirt
 baad main popatlal ko pataa chalata he ki uski 1 karod kii lottery lagi he, par tikat hi uske paas nahin he
 Starts Bhagam portion in Gokuldham Society from here
 ek taraf sabhi popatlal kii 1 karod kii lottery lagane se khush hai, vahiin tikat naa milane par dukhi bhi hai
 Everyone goes to find the ticket for Potlal
 tikat dhundhate vakt sho main hansi kaa phool dose dikhaaya gaya he
 Seeking tickets, everyone walks from the labyrinth to the Dhobi Ghat
 iske baad raddi vaale ke paas
 Then all the men of Gokuldham have put a lot of emphasis to find tickets in the park
 aakhir kya hoga deepawali kaa sandesh?somvaar ko tivi par aae promo main dikhaaya gaya he ki tikat jethalaal ko mil jaataa he
 But this is the reverse spectacle of Tarak Mehta, here nothing happens without laughter and bang
 to ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki popatlal ko lagi lottery ke paise milte hai yaa nahin
 The show Mendeepavalika blast is yet to come
 ye sho saamaajik sandesh dene ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he
 It will be interesting to see what message will be given to the viewers outside the 1 crore lottery
