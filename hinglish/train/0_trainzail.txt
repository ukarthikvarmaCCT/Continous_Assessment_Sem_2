 Today is the birthday of Bhagat Singh
 amritsar main 13 april, 1919 ko hue jaliyanvaala baag ke nirmam hatyakand ne 12 saal ke us bachche ko aisa krantikari banaaya, jiske balidaan ne maut ko bhi amar bana diya
 The name of Bhagat Singh, known as shaheed-e-azam, who fills freedom in the hearts of young people, is immortalized in the pages of history in golden letters
 unke naam se hi angrejon ke pairon tale jameen khisak jaati thi
 India's heroic freedom fighter Bhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1947 at Banga in Laipur district of Punjab province to father Kishan Singh and mother Vidyavati
 12 saal kii umr main jaliyanvaala baag hatyakand ke sakshi rahe bhagat singh kii soch par aisa asar padaa ki unhone lahore ke neshnal college kii padhai chhodkar bharat kii aazaadee ke liye 'noujvaan bharat sabha' kii sthapana kar daali
 The courage with which the valiant fighter Bhagat Singh fought the mighty British government for the independence of the country is a very big role model for today's youth
 aazaadee ke is matvaale ne pehle lahore main 'sanders-vadh' or uske baad dilli kii central asembli main chandrashekhar aaazaad or party ke anya sadasyon ke saath bam-visphot kar british samrajya ke viruddh khule vidroh ko bulandi di
 Bhagat Singh also took the help of Veer Savarkar's revolutionary group 'abhinav Bharat' for all these works and learned the tricks of making bombs from this team
 vir swatantraaa senaanee ne apane do anya saathiyon-sukhdev or raajaguru ke saath milakar kakori cond ko anjaam diya, jisane angrejon ke dil main bhagat sih ke naam kaa khauf paidaa kar diya
 Bhagat Singh did not like the policy of exploitation of the capitalists towards the workers
 8 april 1929 ko central asembli main public sefti or trade dispute bill pesh hua
 Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw their bombs in the assembly and made their point before the government to make their voice heard and protest against the British policies
 donon chaahate to bhaag sakate the, lekin bharat ke nidar putron ne hansat-hansate aatmasamarpan kar diya
 The comments do saal tak jail main rahane ke baad 23 march, 1931 ko sukhdev, raajaguru ke saath 24 saal kii umr main bhagat sih ko lahore jail main faansee de di gai
 These sons of Mother India sacrificed their lives on their motherland, wishing for Sarfaroshi
 unka jajba aaj bhi yuvaaon ke liye ek sikh he
 India became independent, but still this country could not become what Bhagat Singh wanted

 bhagat singh ne in sabhi kaaryo ke liye vir saavarkar ke krantidal 'abhinav bharat' kii bhi sahaayta lee or isi dal se bam banane ke gur siikhe
 The brave freedom fighter, along with his two other comrades - Sukhdev and Rajguru, carried out the Kakori incident, which aroused the name of Bhagat Singh in the hearts of the British

 angreji hukumat ko apni aawaaj sunaane or angrejon kii nitiyon ke prati virodh pradarshan ke liye bhagat singh or batukeshwar dutt ne asembli main bam phodkar apni baat sarkaar ke saamne rakhi
 Both could have run away if wanted, but the fearless sons of India surrendered cheerfully

 The Congress's campaign for Lok Sabha 2014 was aimed at establishing Rahul as the leader of this oldest party, but by the end of the 16th general election, the more charismatic Priyanka has emerged as an alternative to her brother
 akasar apni daadi indira se unki tulana or aakraamak style ne rahul kii mushkilen or badha di hai kyonki modi ke mukaable soch tathaa chhavi ke dharaatal par ve pehle hi haar rahe the
 Some of the central issues of the Congress campaign were Rahul Gandhi's identity as a youth leader, opposition to communal politics and distance from the upa's scandalous image
 unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main ubhaara gaya, jo sangh samarthit bijepi kii kattar soch ke mukaable yuva shakti ko protsaahit karte hue nai samaveshi raajnneeti kaa sutarapaat karegaa
 The youth power was targeted at the first-time 100 million voters, while the BJP had anti-secular credentials to oppose bigotry
 is sandesh ko america raashtrapati chunaav se udhaar liya gaya nayaa madhyam mil gaya
 This medium was appropriate for Rahul's less vibrant and more conversational style of addressing the people
 unki team ke mukhya ranneetikaar mohan gopal ne tounhall style main sabhaayen yojit kin, jinamein rahul bolne kii bajaae chote grupon main logon ko bolte hue sunate rahe
 In his words, the main purpose of all this exercise was to convey this message to the 70 crore Indians who are above the poverty line, but have not yet become part of the middle class
 ek taraf modi, ummid or tarakkee kii raajnneeti paroste rahe, to duusari ore rahul garibi ko aisa shatru bataate rahe, jise sarkari madad ke sahare dur rakhana jaruri he
 The slogans used to promote welfare schemes like MNREGA and food security, such as "eat whole bread, work a hundred days and win Congress", were proving to be ineffective in that youth
 jise ek taraf avasar paane kii bhukh he, to duusari taraf nitigat niskriyata, arthvyavastha ke kharaab prabandhan, vyapak bhrashtachar or rojgaar jutaney main swatah sweekaarya asafalataa ko lekar maujuuda sarkaar se naaraazgi he
 Clearly, the message was not in line with the voter's expectations from the government
 lagata he, rahul ne nae ubharate mahatvakankshi varg ke sarokaaron ko padhgaye main galati kar di, jise muft bhojan kii bajaae rojgaar kii talash he
 Therefore, he could not become a symbol of youth, as he wanted to be due to being younger than Modi
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne jati or samudaay sahit har mudde ke mukaable vikaas ko pradhanta dene kaa jo naaraa uchhaala, usne yuvaaon ko aakarshith kar liya
 When Rahul tried to surround Modi with accusations of alleged capitalism and the rise of the Adani group promoting his friends, he too could not escape the burden of UPA scams in the allocation of coal blocks and 2G spectrum
 bijepi or adani samooh ne jis tarah kramvaar unke aaropon kaa khandan kiya, usase congress kii saakh kaa sankat or bad gaya he
 Worse, the party battling to get a united message straight to the voters got Rs 500 crore
 ke paaramparik media prachaar kaa rukh bich raste main badalanaa padaa jisase logon main bhram failaa
 Congress propaganda kept swinging between slogans like "rahul is our leader" and "modi will bring destruction"
 janvari ke aakhri pakhwaade main rahul ek tivi intervyuu main dikhe, jabaki party ne akhabaaron or televijan par un par kendrit vigyaapan jari kiye
 The first such advertisement came on 20 January, with the slogan - "rahul ji's nine weapons, will remove corruption"
 soshal media par jab is naare kii nakal hone lagi, to party ise rahul samarthak kii bajaae zyada modi virdohi rang dene main jute gai
 Modi's Hindutva image was targeted at slogans like "not radical thinking, youthful vigor" and "har Hath Shakti, Har Hath Pragati"
 gujarat model ko galat bataate hue gujarat main alpsankhyakon ko vikaas ke daayre se baahar rakhe jane ke liye un par hamalaa kiya gaya
 After that a slogan, "main Nahin Hum", showed Rahul with the lower strata of the society
 shor much gaya ki yah naaraa 2011 main bijepi ke chintan shivi main apanaaya gaya tha or usee kii nakal he
 Some senior Congress leaders felt that all was going well, but only then Rahul's first TV interview aired
 ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki, ‘‘is ek intervyuu ne pichley ek yaa do saal main hui kisi bhi ghatana se zyada nuksaan pahunchaaya
 "the advertisements came soon after the interview and people were still searching for his status as a leader
 vigyapanon ke daayre ke baahar party ke sandesh main april ke madhya main naaraa diya gaya ki sonia hi sarvesarva hai, lekin april ke ant tak priyanka ko party kii nai aashaa ke rup main ubhaara jane laga
 The picture in the advertisements was still Rahul's, but on April 14, the way Congress President Sonia Gandhi, through her message, urged voters to keep away communal powers, she was desperately trying to respond to Modi's largely positive messages
 Seen as march main jab rahul apni tounhall sabhaaon main vyast the, tabhi mukhya ranneetikaar ke rup main priyanka kii bhoomika kaa dayera bhi fail gaya
 While managing the propaganda of Rahul Gandhi, she started campaigning for the party and finally decided to a large extent
 priyanka ne jis tarah narendra modi ko jawaab diya, usase bijepi buree tarah hill gai thi
 Rahul decided to do a road show in Varanasi, now learning some lessons from his sister
 priyanka gandhi wadra ko amethi or raibareli main prachaar ke liye jo thodaa bahut samay mila, usamen ve anachaahe hi sahi, rahul par haaavee ho gayi
 He gave a befitting reply to the opponents and the election battle was seen to be changing between Modi and him
 media or har jagah modi kii takkar main unheen par charchaaen aam hone lageen
 But with the turn of this electoral battle towards Varanasi, this battle again turned into Modi vs Rahul
 ab tak congress upaadhyaksh rahul ne khud ko aise vyakti ke rup main ubhaara he, jo hataasha dur karegaa, jabaki narendra modi ummid kii kiran banakar ubhare hai
 It is a war between the thinking of the old India versus the aspirations of the new India
 sabane apni puri takat jhenk di he
 But only on May 16, Rahul and the country will be able to know which message has reached its destination

 Focusing on the better this time, the focus scientist said, 'we believe that we have the potential to be one of the best teams to tour
 philhal, duniya main koi bhi team aisi nahin he jo daure par acha pradarshan kar rahi ho
 You can see what happened to South Africa in Sri Lanka

 'unhone kaha, ‘vah iske bare main jaanata he, kyonki number teen kii bhoomika kaaphi ahm hoti he
 He is a very experienced player
 vah bade score se ek pari dur he
 He needs to spend time at the crease
 agar vah 60-70 ran bana letaa he, to uskaa mizaaj puri tarah badal jayega
 My job is to make sure that his thinking moves in this direction

 ham aapako kai baar aashcharyachakit karenge
 'in the absence of bowlers, taking the wicket of 20 wickets, the edge of the Indian attack has weakened a bit in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and Jaspreet Bumrah but Shastri feels that the bowlers of the team have the ability to take 20 wickets
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas aisa gendbaaji akraman he jo 20 wicket le saktaa he
 You need to try other players
 agar bumraah or bhubaneshwar vanade siries main puri tarah feet hote to nattejey alag hote

 ) glamras chhavi vaali samira reddy apni chhavi badalane kaa man bana chuki hai
 She is focusing on playing a serious character nowadays
 apni isi koshish ko saakaar karne ke liye samira ne sin kii red alert or vaaki un kaa yah faisla sahi sabit hua
 Red Alert has been displayed outside India and has also received awards
 ab yah film bharat main pradarshan ko taiyaar he, 16 july ko ‘red alert’ bharat main relies hone ja rahi he
 This film, made two years ago, is equally contemporary today
 antarrashtriya samaaroh main is film ko puraskaar bhi mili
 Recently, when Sameera came to Delhi, she spoke openly about her film
 apni film ke bare main kuch bataaen?yah film naksalwad par aadhaarit he
 How people do not live their lives due to Naxalism and live fearfully facing problems
 yahi sab ham is film ke jariye logon ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 What was the reason behind signing the film, did you want to change your image or something else? There is nothing to change the image
 main kabhi ek image main bandhi hi nahin
 And then i come here to work, so i try to play all kinds of characters
 red alert yah bataati he ki log kyon naksali ban jate hai
 i do not know if this film changed my image or not, but yes personally i have felt a lot of change in myself during the film
 kis tarah ke badlaav ?red alert karne se pehle main naksalwad ke bare main zyada nahin jaanati thi, lekin film ke liye haa kah dene ke baad maine apane str par research kii to paaya ki naksalwad kitni bhayankar samasya he
 What kind of character are you playing in Red Alert? In this film, i am playing the character of a girl named Lakshmi who is raped in a police station
 baad main vah insaaf na milane ke chalate naksalwadiyon ke saath jud jaati he
 It was difficult to play the character of a goofy girl in a race and which one of the Naxalite girl of Red Alert? Both were difficult
 aap padhe likhe hokar bhi inte naasamajh dikhen ki jaise aap ko kuch aata hi na ho
 And then it was really difficult to go out into the jungles and pick up the gun
 gambhir filmein chunane kii koi badi vajah?haa, ek he to
 That is that people are now starting to like serious films too and Red Alert is made on a very serious subject
 or phir film kii script ne mujhe bahut aakarshith kiya, kyonki isamen ek behad gambhir mudde ko uthaaya gaya he
 i did not know about the Naxalite problem till one and a half years ago
 ab main un kii madad ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati hum
 a minor mistake is overshadowed during the board exam
 vahiin chaatro ko ansar shit main jawaab likhte samay saavdhaaniyaan baratani chahie, taaki pariksha ke parinaam main kisi bhi prakaar kaa prabhaav naa pade
 Know which mistakes should not be made in the answer sheet

 Hence write neatly with the correct answer

 The SIT team involved in the investigation of the murder of Apple's area manager Vivek Tiwariqi in up's capital, Lucknow, on Tuesday, took the eye of the case on the occasion and recanted the scene of the whole incident
 jaanch team main forencik export bhi shaamil the
 On Tuesday afternoon, the SIT team suddenly reached the scene of the incident with Sana and the entire scene of the incident that happened on September 29 has been recanted
 police nevivekjaisi hi ek esayuvi maukey par mangai or vivek kii jagah ek shaks ko baithaaya gaya or uske saath sanaa ko bhi car main baithaaya gaya
 Then on September 29, the way constable Prashant Chaudhary of Uyipolis was fired
 bilkul usee tarah se upi police ke ek consteble ne car par goli chalaai
 Vivek Tiwari was bloodied by the UP police bullet that day
 ab upi police kii goli se 29 sitambar ke hatyakand kii hakeekat kaa sach jaanane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The day Vivek was tortured after being shot, as Sanaa cried, as Sanaa had pleaded for help and Vivek was suffering with blood, all of them were recaptured
 ise upi police kaa encounter part tu maan lijie
 Because to get to the bottom of that massacre, the top police officers of UP police had come for a chance on the incident
 upi police mangalvaar ko gomtinagar ekstansion kii us sadak par puure amale ke saath pahunchi
 Along with Kalpana, the wife of the deceased Vivek Tiwari and Sana, the only witness in the crime, were also present
 waisi hi ek gaadi mangai gai, gaadi main vivek kii jagah ek shaks ko bithaaya gaya
 Sana was made to sit with the man
 phir sanaa ke bataane ke mutabik us drishy ko dohraane kii koshish hui, jaise 29 sitambar ko hua tha
 Actually, after the Vivek Tiwari murder case, there was a lot of shame on the UP Police, the government accepted the demands of Vivek Tiwari's wife on behalf of the government, but only by doing politics of compensation, UP police and UP government cannot clean Pakistan because still There is a lot of truth left in the Vivek massacre
 vivek ko puraa insaaf dilaane kii awaz lagaataar mukhar ho rahi he
 Perhaps it is the effect of those voices that the UP Police is now taking this whole matter with seriousness

 maharashtra main shaayad congress kaa ye sabase kharaab pradarshan he
 Congress should also regret that the party which was formed on the soil of Mumbai 125 years ago, is craving for 1 seat there today
 congress ko maharashtra main bhi ek bhi seat nahin milti agar purv shivasena vidhayak suresh narayan congress main shaamil nahin hote or chandrapur se bijepi ke kaddavar netaa hansraj ahir ko ek kade mukaable main nahin haraate
 Apart from Suresh Narayan, all the big faces of the Congress were defeated, including Sushil Kumar Shinde from Solapur, Ashok Chavan from Nanded, former Maharashtra Congress President Manikrao Thakre from Yavatmal and former Union Minister Milind Deora from Mumbai South
 haalanki, ensipi ko ajit pavaar ke bete kii haar se dhakka laga lekin wo 2014 se 1 seat zyada yani 5 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hui
 Shiv Sena also touched the last 18 seats but despite the Modi wave, Union Ministers Anant Geete, Anand Adsul, Chandrakant Khaire and Shivaji Rao Patil lost the election
 maharashtra ke aakhri nattejey 2014 kii tarah hi rahe
 While Congress got 1, NCP got 5, AIMIM got 1 seat while Shiv sena-bjp managed to save 41 seats
 upie gathbandhan ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ye he ki unka vot share jo 31 fisadi par aa gaya he or 2014 ke mukaable 3 fisadi kam he
 She once again lost all 6 seats in Mumbai while she had faces like Sanjay Nirupam, Priya Dutt and Urmila Matondkar
 sabase khaas baat ye ki maharashtra kii raajnneeti main ek teesraa khilaadi bhi aa gaya he jisane upie gathbandhan ko kam se kam 8 siton par tagada jhatka diya he
 The alliance of Prakash Ambedkar and MIM (deprived Bahujan Aghadi VBA) has garnered 14 per cent of the votes
 saath hi aurangabad kii seat bhi jeet lee he
 The Congress was hoping that its seats would increase but the VBA cut the votes in Sangli Buldhana, Yavatmal, Hatkanangale, Parbhani and Gadchiroli from 70 thousand to 1
5 lakhs, which led to the defeat of the UPA candidates
 yahaan tak kii ashok chavaan or susheel kumaar scindia ko bhi VBA ke chalate haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The VBA is a party made up of a nexus between Muslims and Dalits that made a dent in the Congress ncp's vote bank
 maharashtra ke marathavada or pashchim maharashtra main upie kii ummiden shivasena se acchhee thim lekin jatigat sameekaran ne khel bigaad diya
 The Congress talked to Prakash Ambedkar several times but failed to reach a compromise on seats
 khud chavaan apane kshetra main simat kar rah gaye or chunaav ke baad unhone mana ki vanchit bahujan aghadi ne maharashtra main upie ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 It is believed that the deprived Bahujan Aghadis will prove to be a headache for the UPA in the upcoming Maharashtra assembly elections which are just 4 months away
 haalanki ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar maanate hai ki vanchit bahujan aghadi kaa vot share vidhansabha chunaavon main ghatega, lekin sachai ye he ki agar congress ensipi ne jald koi tod nahin dhundha to vidhansabha main bhi jeetne kii ummid bemaani hogi
 Poonam Pandey, who is active on social media, is constantly in discussion these days

 After this, his fans trolled Poonam fiercely

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday that the Prime Minister has put forward 'a woman' to defend herself in Parliament as he cannot defend himself
 unki is tippanee par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne tikhi pratikriya dete hue vipaksh par raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had said at a farmers rally held in Jaipur on Wednesday that a 56-inch chest guard ran away and asked a lady Sitharamanji to defend me
 main apana bachaav nahin kar saktaa, meraa bachaav kiijie
 Using the word 'woman', Rahul Gandhi said, 'the woman could not defend them for two and a half hours
 maine sidhaa sawaal kiya - haa yaa naa main jawaab dijie lekin vah jawaab nahin de sakin
 He accused the Prime Minister of running away from the discussion yet again, but did not mention the Defense Minister this time
 rahul ke bhaashan ke kuch ghanton baad agra main ek jansabha main pradhanmantri modi ne congress netaaon par desh kii mahilaon kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rescued the opposition's sixes in the Lok Sabha by placing one fact after another on the floor of Parliament on the Rafale deal
 mahila raksha mantri kaa apmaan karne par utarupradhanmantri modi ne rahul gandhi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha, 've ek mahila raksha mantri kaa apmaan karne par utaaru ho gaye hai
 This is an insult to the women of the country
 yah naa keval ek mahila balki bharat kii samast mahila shakti kaa apmaan he jiske liye in gaiyr jimmedaarana netaaon ko keemat chukaani padegi
 The Prime Minister said that it is a matter of pride that a woman became the first Minister of Defense in the country
 rahul gandhi pichley maheene 5 rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad rajasthan main congress ke satta main aane ke baad pehali jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He said that if the Congress comes to power at the Center after the Lok Sabha elections this year, it will waive the farm debt
 rafel saude main kathith aniyamittaaon kaa aarope doharaate hue unhone kaha ki isaki jaanch honi chahie tathaa sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) banani chahie
 The Leader of the Opposition claimed that Modi could not answer some of the questions asked by him on the deal
 pradhanmantri failaa rahe ghrinaa'chaukeedaar chor he' ke naaron ke bich rahul ne kaha, 'loksabhaa main rafel maamle par charchaa ho rahi he, narendra modi ji punjab bhaag gaye or vahaan kii ek uniwarsity main bhaashan dete hai
 But in the public court (lok Sabha), Modi ji did not step for a minute
 kyonki chaukeedaar ne chori kii he or chaukeedaar darkar bhaag gaya
 He accused the Prime Minister of spreading hatred
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'ham na to mukhyamantri or na hi pradhanmantri ke bare main budtamiji se bolenge or jahaan unka aadar karne kii jarurat hogi, congress party unka aadar karegi
 In the Rafale case, if Modi gets Anil Ambani by stealing Rs 30,000 crore, then justice will also be done
 victimigeshan nahin hoga
 Pressure will not be created, but justice will certainly be done
 congress netaa ne kaha ki agar congress sarkaar centre main satta main aati he to krishi karj maaf karegi lekin saath hi unhone kaha ki karjamaafee, samasya kaa sthaayee samaadhaan nahin he
 He said, 'which was a matter of debt waiver, it will definitely help the farmer but his problem will not be solved
 yah sirf pehla kadam he yah antim kadam nahin he kyonki bina kisi nai ranneeti ke desh main kisaanon kaa bhavishya nahin ban saktaa
 The Bihar government will not create any new district and subdivision in the state
 vidhansabha main somvaar ko grih vibhaag ke prabharee mantri bijendra prasad yadav ne kaha ki nayaa jila or anumandal srijan karne kaa rajya sarkaar kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 There was no proposal for a new district or subdivision in which BJP MLA Vidya Sagar Kesari raised the question in a starred question
 unka jawaab dete hue yadav ne kaha ki rajya main nae jila or anumandal ke srijan ko lekarpradesh sarkaarake paas philhal koi prastaav nahin he
 According to Kesari, he wanted to know whether a proposal was sent by the local body and administration three years ago to make the Farbisganj subdivision a district or not
 The previous NDA government of the state, under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister, to explore the possibility of creating a new district and subdivision in the state Committee was formed
 is par mantri bijendra yadav ne apane jawaab main kaha ki aisa kuch nahin kiya gaya tha

 party ke pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha, pradesh prabharee shakti singh gohil or tarik anwar kii aguwai mencongresskaaryakartaaon ne patna kii sadakon par jan vednaa march nikaala
 In order to deal with this, the police administration had made a roundabout security system
 pradesh sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji karte hue congress kaaryakartaaon kaa dal hadataali chowk par pahunchaa
 To prevent this, police had already put up barricades

 To stop this, the police gave Nelathicharjkar
 virodh pradarshan kii tasvirpulice kii is karrwai main kuch kaaryakartaaon ko chot lagane kii bhi khabar he
 After the lathicharge, the protesters disintegrated here and there
 haalanki sarkaar ke khilaaf unki narebaaji jari rahi

 iske baad hi un logon ne shahar par hamalaa kar diya or sabhi ko shahar se baahar nikaal diya

 haalanki is par kaam kareeb chah maheene pehle shuru ho gaya tha
 2000 rupee notes started arriving in banks
 lekin bank karmchaariyon ko nahin bataaya gaya tha ki un noton kaa kya karnaa he or wo kisalie pahunchaae gaye
 Apparently the success of this announcement was in the matter that the curtain could not be removed from it and this happened completely in this case
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki 500-1000 rupee ke note khatm karne ke faisle main waisi hi gopneeyata rakhi gai jaisi ki bajet banaate vakt hoti he
 The aim behind this was that no one could take advantage of it
 sarkaar ko apane is maqasad main puri kamyaabi mili kyonki pradhanmantri ke elaan ke baad hi puure desh ko iske bare main pataa chalaa
 However work on it started about six months ago
 bainkon main 2000 rupee ke note chap kar pahunchane lage the
 But the bank employees were not told what to do with those notes and why they were delivered
 jaahir he is elaan kii kamyaabi isi baat main thi ki isse pardaa na hat sake or is maamle main puri tarah se aisa hi hua

 (from input language) china kii police ne seemaa paar maadak padaarthon kii taskari karne vaale gang kaa pardaafash kiya he
 The police have arrested four Myanmar smugglers
 taskaron ne maadak padaartho ke 138 packet nigal liye the
 These drugs are heroin, methamphetamine and yaba
 samachar agency sinhua ke mutabik, police ne sichuaan praant main in sandigdhon kaa eksre kiya
 Thumb-shaped structures were found in his stomach
 aakhirkaar inke paas se maadak padaartho ke 183 packet baraamad kiye gaye, jinka vajan 916 gram he
 Police investigations revealed that the four men were asked to smuggle drugs from Myanmar to Chongqing
 iske badale prati packet 260 yuan (40 dollar) dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 So far, police have seized more than 440 grams of methamphetamine, 26 grams of yaba and more than one kilogram of heroin and eight guns

 According to the report of Xinhua, the US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan at a press conference called TCO and narcotics a serious problem and said that close cooperation can only reduce these threats

 ek sadan chal rahaa he or doosraa nahin, yah sankhya kaa ahankaar nahin he to kya he
 Sitaram Yechury's reply to Arun Jaitley as Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha comes that this House is not running and that House is running, only because there is a majority of terror
 aaj subah rajyasabha main di gai in donon daleelon ko baar-baar padhie
 Both these sentences seem hollow even after being attached to Brahmastra in terms of parliamentary politics or strategy
 ye khaali bartan main bajte zyaada hai, inkaa matlab kuch khaas nahin he
 Both sentences do not suggest a way to let the House run, but instead give a policy cover to their ego
 hakeekat yah he ki loksabhaa main bhi vipaksh ke paas itani sankhya to he hi ki vah chaahe to sadan kii kaarywahi main baadha daal de or rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas itani samajhadaari to he ki chaahe to 30 second ke ek bayaan se sara maamla nipta de
 The impasse that is being created in the name of protest is no more than a batuchan
 sadan ko na chalane dene main congress or bijepi kaa bartaav itnaa ek jaisaa he ki aap taraazoo lekar tolate rah jaaen, phir bhi donon ko alag-alag paladon par nahin rakh paaenge
 Why Congress, BJP, all parties behave the same
 nahin chalane dena he, to nahin dena he
 During the 15th Lok Sabha, the BJP boycotted the session
 vah jo daleel tab detii thi, ab congress yaa vipaksh kii ho gai he or sarkaar tab kii congress sarkaar kii tarah baat karne lagi he
 The work of the country was still stalling, and the work of the country is still stagnating
 is maamle main bijepi bhi naitik rup se utani hi kamazor he, jitani congress
 The historically poor record of the 15th Lok Sabha is not just the failure of the Congress, but also of the BJP
 ye donon bade dal tab bhi the, or aaj bhi hai
 Though the numbers have gone from here, but both of them did not show any exemplary example in their time in allowing the House to function
 isliye hangaame kii raajnneeti kar rahi congress or vipakshi partiyon ko bijepi kaa naitik upadesh utana hi khokhla lagata he, jitna congress kaa yah upadesh ki sadan chalaane kii zimmedaari sarkaar kii he
 Other opposition parties are also united with the Congress in the Rajya Sabha
 kya dharmantaran or dharmik azaadi par hone vaale hamale ke bayanon par pradhanmantri kaa jawaab itnaa gairmamuli he ki vah itane dinon tak vipakshi sadasyon kii maang ko andekha kar rahe hai
 Parliamentary politics has become such a feudal tradition that the Prime Minister will not always speak
 isaki kya tuk he
 When the government is responsible to the House and the Prime Minister speaks outside the House, remains in a constant dialogue posture, then what goes into making a statement everyday within the House
 kya sarkaar ahankaar kii niti par nahin chal rahi he
 Does the Prime Minister's silence on this issue not encourage the leaders or organizations to proselytize or express religious frustrations
 jab pradhanmantri apane saansadon se kah hi rahe hai ki ham sirf vikaas ke agenda par jitkar aae hai to is baat ko vah sadan main bhi kah sakate the
 Sharad Yadav is repeatedly saying that the Prime Minister has made a question of prestige that he will not speak on this issue
 kya vipaksh ne pradhanmantri ke bayaan ko pratishtha kaa sawaal nahin bana liya he
 Of course, there are weaknesses in the arguments of the opposition as well
 kaayade se yah maamla grih mantralay ke tahat aata he, isliye grahamantri rajnath singh kaa bayaan paryaapt mana janaa chahie, lekin vipaksh kaa kahana he ki dharmantaran ke bahaane desh main dharmik katutaa kaa maahaul paidaa kiya ja rahaa he or is maamle main spashtataa sarkaar ke sabase bade netaa pradhanmantri ke bayaan se hi aegi
 As much as the Prime Minister can say outside, but the statement inside the House will be considered more formal and policy
 kya vipaksh ko charchaa ho jane tak pradhanmantri ke bayaan kii maang se parhez nahin karnaa chahie
 Satyavrat Chaturvedi says that we just need assurance that after discussion the Prime Minister will speak, even then the government is silent on this
 agar sarkaar abhi charchaa kii maang par koi aashwaasan nahin de rahi he, to iskaa kya bharosa ki bahes ke baad pradhanmantri jawaab hi denge, or agar denge, to pehle kehane main kya harj he
 BJP is accusing the opposition that many bills are stuck
 satyavrath chaturvedi kah rahe hai ki hamane paanch bill paas karaane main madad kii he
 Cooperated with the government in the insurance bill
 bijepi congress ke jamaane main pradhanmantri kii chuppi ke mudde par bhi jitkar ai he
 When their leader speaks, what is the problem in speaking in the House? kya vah bayaan dekar vipaksh ko nihattha nahin kar sakate hai
 It is okay that the Prime Minister continues to communicate with the public at his level, but if the same process is within the House, will we not see something different from the Manmohan decade that the current minister provided not only on the demand of the opposition, but also on many issues from himself But let's say, we are creating new patterns
 satta or vipaksh ke bich ahan kii is ladaai kaa faisla sahi galat ke paimaane par nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki donon hi galat hai
 In this case, if anyone has a chance to draw a new line, it is the government and the head of the government should pull this line by giving a statement
 yah bhi kahana chahie ki jitani baar vipaksh poochhega, agar main sadan main rahoonga to main hi jawaab duungaa
 What is the matter of ego in this? pradhanmantri kii garima badhegi yaa kam hogi
 In my opinion, it will increase
 vipaksh main rahete hue bijepi bhi yahi kiya karti thi
 Congress and BJP used to play a lot of matches
 bijepi kahati thi ki charchaa karo, lekin is niyam ke tahat karo
 The UPA government used to say that they would discuss, but not under that rule, in this rule
 nateeja, hafton sadan nahin chalata tha
 Whose loss was it congress, bijepi yaa desh kaa
 Both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have a poor record in running Zero Hour
 yah isliye bhi ho rahaa he ki hamane raajnneeti ko dalon main samet diya he
 We never see parliamentary politics out of the grooves of Congress, BJP
 chunaav ke dauraan hamaara jor sarkaar par itnaa hota he ki ham bhul jate hai ki chunaav ayog sarkaar ke liye loksabhaa ke gathan ke liye chunaav karaata he
 a good parliamentarian gets elected, but political parties cleverly convert it into a campaign of a leader or a party government
 vakt aa gaya he ki ham sansadeey raajnneeti or chunavi raajnneeti ke fark ko samajhen
 Let us also redefine the parliamentary tactics
 vipaksh kaa hangaamaa agar hangaamaa he to sarkaar kaa na sunanaa kya he
 Then where is the dialogue
 is daanv-pench se is vakt chunavi sambhaavnaaen to prabhavit nahin ho rahi hai, balki janata ko tamaam muddon par vistaar se bahes sunne ke maukey se vanchit hona pad rahaa he
 It is a big loss of democracy that we also form an easy opinion
 yah sahi yaa vah galat kii raay
 We never argue about the specifics of a bill and the good and bad effects that it can have on our lives
 ham sabko saaf-saaf yaa aar-paar chahie
 Perhaps this is the result of the deadlock in the Rajya Sabha
 uttar pradesh main angreji sharaab kii bikri lagaataar gir rahi he, jiske chalate sarkaar kaa rajasav prabhavit ho rahaa he
 The concern of the government has also increased due to the decrease in sales of English liquor
 upi sarkaar ne sabhi jiladhikariyon ko nirdesh jari karte hue is kami par niyantran karne kaa aadesh diya he
 On the other hand, the reason for the decrease in sales of English liquor is being said to be a huge increase in its prices
 'hui mahangi bahut hi sharaab ki thodi-thodi piya karo'


 ji haa, uttar pradesh main angreji sharaab ke mahange hone kaa asar ab dikhne laga he or mahangaai ke chalate angreji sharaab kii bikri main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 People have reduced drinking of English liquor in the state, due to which the government is losing revenue
 haalanki chandauli ke jiladhikari surendra vikram ne is baat ko nakaar diya
 He said, 'there is no shortage of revenue anywhere
 rajasav hamaare yahaan bad rahaa he
 The government has recently issued orders to all district magistrates to increase revenue collection by increasing enforcement
 usame bhi hamaare saare adhikari lage hue hai or ham puraa prayaas kar rahe hai kii rajasav main kahi koi kami na hone paae
 Now even though DM Sahab may say that there is no shortfall in revenue collection, the reality is that according to last month's data in the district of Chandauli, English liquor sales have come down by 16 percent
 deshi sharaab or bear kii bikri main kramshah aath pratishat or pantis pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 Now the question is, why is the sale of English liquor in the state decreasing day by day? Excise Department officials believe the reason for the increase in the prices of English liquor
 rajasekhar upaadhyaay (jila aabkaari adhikari, chandauli) ne kaha, 'janapad chandauli main maah june tak deshi madiraa main aath percent kii vruddhi he
 Foreign liquor is down about sixteen percent and beer has a thirty-five percent increase
 sawaal-giravat kyon aa rahi he kuch pataa chal paa rahaa he?jabaab-giravat main sharaab kaa mahangaa hona bhi ek mahatvapurn kaaran he
 Intensive checking is being done to ensure that the shops are not sold illegally
 sawaal-kya upaay kiye ja rahe hai?jabaab-angreji daaru kii vruddhi ke liye usame tetra pack kaa bhi aadesh hua he
 An intensive investigation has also been ordered that illegal liquor should not be sold from anywhere
 iske liye nirantar team bhi gathit kii gai he or lagaataar checking kii ja rahi he
 Significantly, a large part of the revenue of the state comes from the Excise Department
 aise main ghatate rajasav ko lekar sarkaar kaa chintit hona lajimi bhi he
 But the big question is that in UP after all, the reason for the continuous decrease in the sale of English liquor is not the liquor being sold illegally from other states after its increased prices, where the rate of Uttar Pradesh Are much less than the rate

 The show watchers believe it would fade without them

 During the Australia trip, Kapil had a fight with Sunil on the flight and abused him
 OMG! sunil grover se ladaai ke baad set par roe kapil sharmaagle saal ginni se shaadi karenge kapil sharma2
 Chandu Chaiwale and Nani also made distance from the show along with distancesunil when Chandan Prabhakar and Ali Asgar were also present on the flight when Kapil misbehaved and threatened to expel them from the show
 ye donon hi sho main ahm role nibhaate hai
 In the same way, if Kapil is caught in his pride, he may have to pay a heavy price and it will affect his show and its TRP
 OMG! sunil grover se ladaai ke baad set par roe kapil sharma3
 Preeti Simos, all the fans have agreed that Preity, the creative director of 'the Kapil Sharma Show', has also decided to stay away from Kapil's show

 The controversy grew so much that Kapil had to shut down his show and after that his new show started on Sony channel

 According to Hinduism, Vishnu is considered one of the three main forms of God
 vishnu ko vishwa kaa paalanhaar mana jaataa he
 He is an important part of the Trimurti and is considered omnipresent
 dharti par rahane vaale samast jeevon ke aashray hone kii vajah se unhen narayan bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is said that the entire world is governed by the power of Lord Vishnu
 ve nirgun bhi hai or sagun bhi
 They hold conch, chakra, mace and padma in their four hands
 unka nivas kshirsagar he or ve sheshnag ke upar shayan karte hai
 Learn some tricks of successful and picturesque life from the world rearing
 
 
 1
 Always maintain restraint: Vishnu has a reputation as a God who does not lose patience even in odd circumstances
 sanyam banaae rakhte hai
 Along with this, they are always ready to help others
 2
 Learn Multitasking If we look closely at Vishnu and read, we find that he is a perfect multitasker
 ek hi samay main vah kai roopon-avtaron main apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam de rahe hote hai
 Not only this, they do not get tired just by carrying out all such works
 3
 It is learned from them to do charity in righteousness, but we all expect others to do the things that we have done to others, and the next one is under the burden of our tools
 vahiin vishnu hamen hameshaa neki karne or use vyapak saamaajik hit ke maddenjar bhul jane kii prerana dete hai
 4
 har visham paristhiti main dhairya banaae rakhanavishnu ko hameshaa se aise bhagwaan ke rup main khyaati mili he jo devataaon or aap janamanas kii guhaar par maujuud ho jate hai
 Never lose patience and help in every way possible
 aapako ek magar dwaara hathi kii taang khinchne or uskiguharper vasudev kaa daude chale aana to yaad hi hoga

 Today, where marriages break up in just a few years, months, days and hours, Lakshmi and Vishnu remained with each other for ages
 manch par paakhand kii nautanki kar logon ko ullu banane vaale narayan sai par ab aisi padi he ki usne apana huliya hi badal liya he
 Due to the hair and beard of which his satsang shop was running, if a seeker of Narayan Sai believed that now Sai has lost his hair and beards
 jab sitare buland the, to bhagwaan shrikrishna kaa rup dharkar gopiyon ke saath dandiya khelaa karte the
 When the mind was filled with playing dandiya, the sermon shop used to get decorated
 or jab gyaan baantkar bor ho jate, to bansuri tham kar phir se kanha kii nakal utaarne lagate the
 But now these men are surrounded by allegations of rape and sexual exploitation in such a way that the face of the different person is not hiding this face
 narayan sai ke chehre se dhong or paakhand kaa nakaab aisa utraa he ki ab ye cheharaa hi inaki sabase badi musiibat ban gaya he
 Lakshman Sevakani, a seeker of Narayan Sai, who hails from Agra, said that he saw him in a clean shaved avatar without hair and beard
 darasal, gujarat police ke saath chuuhe-billi ke khel khel rahe narayan sai kii talash main krime branch kii team ne jab agra main dabish di, to unki yahi kahani saamne ai
 It was learned that Narayan Sai had reached the house of his servant in Agra on Saturday night in the wake of running away from the police
 apane driver ke saath aae sai ne inase nae sim card kii maang kii
 Which his serviceman refused to fulfill, but at night gave shelter to Narayan Sai and gave him milk
 lekin is dauraan unhone narayan sai kaa jo rup dekha, to narayan ke ab tak ke tamaam roopon se juda tha
 This time neither Narayan had hair in his head nor face
 yani police se bachane ke chakkar main narayaan ne apane sir ke bal munda rakhe the or dadhi bhi banavaa rakhi thi
 By the way, after the revelation of Narayan Sai about this new form of service, now the police have also started trying to visualize Narayan Sai in different forms, so that in this game of cat-cat, suddenly Narayan comes in front of him
 On leaving, there should be no mistake in identifying them
 or narayan sai ke in chehron main unke narmal hulie ke alaava, sir par bal or moonchhen, sir par bal or clin shevd or sir or chehre par bina bal or dadhi ke hulie kaa sketch bhi banavaa kar police dekh rahi he
 These days the Gujarat Police has issued a lookout notice against Narayan Sai after the rape report was filed in Surat, but Narayan Sai is trying to run away from him instead of confronting the police
 nae sim kaa istemaal kar baaten kar rahe hai
 On 6 October, two Surat-based sisters accused Asaram and his son Narayan Sai of rape
 choti bahan ne surat main baqayada exiaar darj karai
 Narayan Sai just disappeared from the same day, otherwise he was engaged in hiding the sins of his father
 6 oktober kii raat narayan sai jaipur ke hanuman nagar vaale apane gupt adde par tha
 He was then accompanied by his close aide Mohit Bhojwani, who was later arrested by the police
 7 oktober kii alsubah narayan sai kaale rang kii forchunar car main savaar hua or jaipur se sriganganagar sthit apane ashram main chalaa gaya
 From there he fled to Delhi
 is dauraan police kii talash jari rahi
 On October 17, police raided the Jaipur ashram
 baqayada narayan sai ke dost mohit bhojawaani ke saath
 When the police started investigating Narayan Sai's ashram on Goner Road, it was shocking to know how girls were supplied in this ashram for Narayan
 police ko bhojawaani ke laptop se kai ashleel tasviren or ms bhi mili
 Mohit Bhojwani is accused that through his whatsapp, he not only tried to provoke supporters, but code messages have also been used in many messages
 monica naam kii ek sadhika se baatcheet main mohit ne kuch aisa likhaa- saamaan mil gaya to ram ram
 
 
 Monica
 nahin mila to hari hari
 Actually, Narayan Sai's obscene quartet has three more pieces - Mohit Bhojwani, whose job was to provoke people and drive Narayan back and forth
 doosraa naam monica agarwal kaa he, jo sai ke liye ladkiyaan supplai karti thi or teesraa naam hanuman kaa he, jo narayan sai kaa rasoiyaa bhi he or uske liye ladakiyon par dabaav daalane vaala bhi
 Narayan Sai, who had committed many crimes for many years, insisted on a heel peak for anticipatory bail, and in that affair, it is alleged that he also gave a fake affidavit in the court
 haalanki adaalat ne agrim jamaanat kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 But Narayan Sai went on every vicious trick to protect himself like a professional criminal
 khud par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagane ke baad se hi usne mobile ke 17 sim badale
 Using each sim once breaks it
 aakhri baar agra ke apane sadhak se sim maanga lekin usne dene se manaa kar diya
 Who used to teach Kanha to people in the course of a day, would become the kingpin of sex gang as soon as he got out of the world
 ji haa, tafteesh ke aaine main police ko narayan sai kaa jo nayaa aks dikh rahaa he, wo aisa hi he
 The only target of his gang was to trap the new girls and take them to the 'mota-bhagwan' hut and then to woo the devotees in the closed hut
 manch par ta-ta thaiyya karaate-karaate asaram ne kab apane bete narayan sai ko sex gang chalaane kii salaahiyat de di, ye baap-bete ke kartab dekh rahe lakhon bhakton ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 When the Gujarat police arrested Asaram in a criminal charge and questioned him about his misdeeds, not only Asaram himself but his son Narayan Sai's gang also came out in front of the open
 pataa chalaa ki narayan sai bhi apane pita asaram kii tarah baqayada apane sadhak rupi gurgon kii gang lekar desh bhar main phirata tha
 And the only task of this gang and only one was to introduce new girls to Narayan Sai by trapping them
 gujarat police ke sutron kii maane to narayan sai ne apane is gang main kaam karne vaale har gurgey ko alag-alag kaam saunp rakhe the
 If someone prepares the girl for the so-called surrender, then it makes the girl feel special after surrendering
 or agar koi ladki baghawat karti, to usase nipatane kaa kaam bhi koi or karata
 Overall, Sai's sex gang was in many ways even higher than his father Asaram's gang

e
 5% of GST tax slab
 should go
 baba ramdev ne kaha ki maujuuda samay main petrol-dijal kii keemat aam aadmi kii jeb ko khaali karne kaa kaam kar rahi he

 Despite fresh criticisms from the BJP, Congress leader Digvijay Singh upheld his statement concerning the Maharashtra ATS chief today, saying that Karkare's life was threatened by Hindu fundamentalist groups
 lekin spasht kiya ki unhone mumbai aatankwaadi hamale main pakistani tatwon kii bhoomika hone par kabhi andeh nahin kiya? singh ne vipakshi party bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki usne hindu kattarwadi sanghathanon ko apana samarthan diya tha
 The BJP lashed out at Digvijay Singh for saying that Congress should show its way out immediately to make this 'outrageous' remark about ATS chief Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the Mumbai terror attack
 digvijay ne kaha he ki 26 navambar 2008 ko hue mumbai aatankwaadi hamale se kuch hi ghante pehle karkare ne unhen bataaya tha ki maalegaanv jaanch ke maddenjar unhen hindu kattarwadi sanghathanon se apni suraksha ko lekar chintaa he
 BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu termed his statement as a "foolish comment" and said that Pakistan would be happy only with these comments
 congress mahasachiv ne bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, ‘main adwani ji or rajnath ji se poochna chahta hum ki maalegaanv visphot ke baad jab sadhvi pragna ko giraftaar kiya gaya to ve pradhanmantri se milane kyon gaye
 Why did Rajnath go to jail to meet him? The BJP will have to answer these questions before asking anything to the Prime Minister
 ’ singh ne daawa kiya tha ki karkare ne maalegaanv visphot kii jaanch kii mukhaalafat kar rahe logon se apni jaan ko khatra bataaya tha
 Hindu fundamentalists are alleged to have been involved in the Malegaon blast
 unhone kaha ki 26 / 11 ko mumbai hamale main pakistani tatwon kii bhoomika par unhen kabhi andeh nahin rahaa 
 Digvijay said, 'I never said that right-wing organizations were involved in the terrorist attack
 lekin yah ek tathy he ki on ricard kah saktaa hum ki vah :karkare: ko kuch dakshinpanthi kaaryakartaaon se khatra tha
 Digvijay Singh, while trying to separate the Congress party from this issue, said, 'this is not the issue of the Congress party
 yah mudda mere or karkare ke bich baatcheet se sambandhit he
 The Congress yesterday shrugged off Digvijay's statement saying that "this issue is an issue between two persons"
 ’ congress ke pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne kaha ki yah digvijay singh par he vah is bare main vistrut jaankaree den, pushti karen yaa isse inkaar kar den
 Senior Congress leader Anil Shastri suggested that the so-called phone call should be investigated between Digvijay Singh and Karkare for national security
 unhone kaha, ‘yah rashtriya suraksha ke liye jaruri he ki karkare ke aatankwaadi hamale main shahid hone ke baavjood digvijay singh or karkare ke bich telephone kaal kii jaanch kii jaae
 BJP Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, "as far as i know Digvijay, he is not among those who resign on their own for uttering statements
" istipha maangane par bhi vah jaldi dene vaale nahin
 In such a situation, the Congress should force them to go out
 aisa nahin kiya gaya to is desh ko chaahane vaale log congress ko kabhi maaf nahin karenge
 'he said,' In an effort to remain in the pleasantries, Digvijay is giving a rude statement
 congress ne unke bayanon se apane ko alag kiya he
 But this is not satisfactory at all
 congress ko apane mahasachiv kii anargal baton ke liye desh se maafee maangani chahie or unase istipha lenaa chahie
 BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi asked the Congress leadership to explain how a person like Digvijay Singh has remained in the party's general secretary post
 vihip ke mahasachiv praveen togadiya ne kaha ki digvijay ke bayaan se yah lagata he ki vah ‘pakistani agent’ ke rup main kaary kar rahe hai

 The report includes 133 million American user records, 18 million British user records, and 50 million Vietnam records

 Because the server was not protected with password and that is why it has leaked
 tech crunch kii report ke mutabik security research sanyam jain ne paaya he ki 419 million fasebuk yugers ke phone number public hai
 In fact, Sanyam Jain has found an online database of Facebook which has about 419 million phone numbers linked to the user ID
 tech crunch kii ek report ke mutabik yujar idi se phone number link karne ke kram main kai yugers ke asli naam, gender or country jaise data bhi public hai
 This server was without a password, although that server has been made offline after the report
 soshal media company fasebuk ne is report ke baad tech crunch se kaha he, ‘ye data purana he or ye pehle hi liya gaya tha
 Only last year, the company has made changes under which Facebook has removed the feature by which people could find someone through the phone number on Facebook ', although Facebook has also said that this data has been removed and there is no evidence So that it can be said that these Facebook accounts have been hacked
 bhale hi fasebuk ye kah kar apana pallaa jhaad le ki company ne badlaav kar liye hai or wo data bhi hataa liye gaye the
 But the question is how and why the phone numbers of so many users were stored in a server with no password
 isse pehle bhi vakt be vakt fasebuk data brich hota rahaa he
