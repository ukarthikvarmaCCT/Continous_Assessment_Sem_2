 The UK government is going to impose restrictions on the right to 'right to settle' given to migrants

 Apart from Divyanka and Karan in Yeh Hai Mohabbatein, people liked the important character very much

 The show debuted in December 2016
 ab iske spin of kii lonching bhi disambar main hone vaali he
 Union Minister General VK Singh has given a long reply on his Facebook page to those who made a noise on his statement in Rajya Sabha
 unhone kaha he ki dalit bacchon kii dukhad hatya par kahi unki baat ko chote bachche bhi aasaani se samaj jate, lekin unke bayaan se "vibhaajak raajnneeti ke upaask or supaari patrakarita karne vaale" achaanak jaagrit ho gaye
 General Singh wrote that i always believed that there would be a great gathering of knowledge, experience, wisdom in the upper house of our representatives and the representatives of the country would be looking for solutions by arguing on the complex issues of India
 alpamaanasikta se dooshit raajnneeti se pare, rajya sabha main rashtrahit ke sarvopari hone kii apeksha kii thi maine
 But this belief of mine was horribly hurt when i found the members of the Rajya Sabha indulging in the frivolous game of politics, which is also painful for me to describe
 yah mere vishwaas ke pare tha ki vahaan rajya sabha main kuch sadsy unheen tatwon ke prakaar prathit ho rahe the, jinase hamen bachapan se saavdhaan rahanaa sikhaaya jaataa he
 The comments maine kuch din pehle ek tippanee main kaha tha ki kanoon vyavastha rajya sarkaar kaa jimmaa hoti he, or ek upama de kar yah samajhane kaa prayaas kiya tha ki har durghatana kaa doshaaropan centre sarkaar par karnaa anuchit he
 Young school going children would have understood this simile, but it was a golden opportunity for those who have made the aim of their lives to overcome this government by imaginary issues
 supaari patrakarita or vibhaajak raajnneeti ke upaask yakaayak jaagrit ho uthe
 By the way, it also seemed that the princess was cut off from reality
 sarkaar ne mehnat se kam samay main vah sab sambhav kar dikhaaya jo bharat itihaas main abhootpurv he
 a popular government had become more popular in public with its performance
 agar aise hi chalata rahaa to inkaa nambar nahin aane vaala
 The common man of our country certainly does not make "noise as those goose goats", even if he is tolerant of this drama of yours, but do not forget to consider him a fool
 vah sab jaanata, or sab samajhataa he
 And you target me and say that i am dividing the country in the name of religion and caste? "my principles have been carved out where life is sacrificed for the country
 bhagwaan kaa shukr manaaiye ki bhartiya sena in ghatiya baton main na kabhi padi he, or na kabhi padegi
 “we are just patriots, and want to be just that
 baaki or kuch hamaare jazbe kaa apmaan he
 i am not someone who has inherited a political position, nor someone who has any political ambitions
 main abhi bhi bas ek sainik hum jo desh kii seva main sab kuch arpan karne kaa dam rakhata he
 i just have a hope that my countrymen know me this way, and also your political drama

 !!! general singh ne likhaa ki meraa hameshaa se vishwaas tha ki hamaare desh kii upree pratinidhi sabha main gyaan, anubhav, vivek kaa mahasamagam hota hoga or desh ke pratinidhi bharat ke jatil muddon par tark vitark kar ke samaadhaan dhundhate honge
 i expected the national interest to be paramount in the Rajya Sabha, beyond politics corrupted by inferiority
 parantu meraa yah vishwaas bheeshan rup se tab aahat hua jab maine rajya sabha ke sadasyon ko raajnneeti ke chuuhe billi vaale tuchh khel main lipt paaya jiskaa varnan karnaa bhi mere liye peedaadaayi he
 It was beyond my belief that some members of the Rajya Sabha there seemed to be the same type of elements from which we are taught to be careful from childhood
 tippaniyan i said in a comment a few days ago that law and order is the responsibility of the state government, and by giving a simile, i tried to explain that it is unfair to blame every accident on the central government
 skool jane vaale chote bachche is upama ko sahi samaj jate, parantu jinhone apane jivan kaa uddeshy is sarkaar ko asli muddon se vimukh kar ke kaalpanik muddon se jujhana bana liya he, unke liye yah ek sunaharaa avasar tha
 Worshipers of betel journalism and divisive politics suddenly woke up
 vaise yah bhi prathit ho rahaa tha ki shahzaade vaastaviktaa se cat chuke hai
 The government has done all that is unprecedented in India history in less time than hard work
 ek lokapriy sarkaar apane pradarshan se janata main or zyaada priy ho gai thi
 If it continues like this, then its number will not come
 hamaare desh kaa aam aadmi beshak "un kiraaye ke gundon jitna shor" na machaata ho, bhale hi vah aapke is naatak ke prati sahansheel ho, magar use budhu samajhane kii bhul mat kariye
 He knows everything and understands everything
 or aap mujhe nishaanaa bana kar kehete hai ki main desh ko dharm or jati ke naam par baant rahaa hum? "mere siddhant vahaan gadhe gaye hai jahaan desh ke liye jaan di jaati he
 Thank God that the Indian Army has never been involved in these inferior things, and never will
 " ham sirf deshbhakt hai, or bas yahi rahanaa chaahate hai
 Anything else is an insult to our spirit
 main koi aisa nahin hum jise rajnatik pad viraasat main mil gaya he, or na hi koi aisa jisaki koi rajnatik mahatvakanksha he
 i am still just a soldier who has the power to offer everything in the service of the country
 mujhe bas ek aashaa he ki mere deshvasi mujhe is tarah jaanate hai, or saath hi aapke rajnatik naatak ko bhi
 Jai Hind

 Documents seized from Laden's house revealed that he was being prepared to be given the leadership of Al Qaeda

 It is believed that this marriage took place in Iran

 chennai main pani kaa sankat surkhiyon main he
 The same is true of many other cities of South India
 vaise to har saal garmiyon main pani kii killat hoti he lekin is saal sankat bada he
 The Central Water Commission is stating that a significant cause of water crisis in Chennai and other major cities is the declining water level in the reservoirs

 The worst situation is in Karnataka, where 4 large reservoirs have just 1 to 2% water left in their capacity, only two percent water is left in four major reservoirs of Maharashtra
 vahaan ke chah bade jalaashyon kaa pani istemaal ke laayak nahin bachaa he
 There is a demand in Maharashtra that the government plan to add reservoirs and make laws on it
 maharashtra se rajya sabha saansad sambaaji kshatrapati ne enditivi se kaha ki global varming ke asar ko study karnaa behad zaruri he
 At the same time, he requested the government to initiate linking of the reservoirs so that water can be transferred from the reservoirs in Maharashtra where there is excess water

 The view of the 11A number bungalow of Balwant Rai Mehta Lane, located in Lutyens' Delhi, is like destruction in a building in a war zone
 kamaron se ukhaade gayi khidki daravaaje or deevaaron se nikaali gayi tilein, bikharaa padaa furniture, khandhar main tabdeel huye baraamde, is bangale kii taaja tasviir kaa hissaa hai
 The bungalow is allotted in the name of Pappu Yadav, a former MP from Bihar, and the cause of the destruction in the bungalow is said to be removed from the additional construction work done before it was vacated

 Ajay Kumar, Pappu Yadav's private secretary present at the residence, claimed that the bungalow had about 400 people staying, he said, "our MP had made arrangements to stay at the residence for the patients who are in Bihar including Madhepura
 Used to come to Delhi from other areas of the city for treatment
 isiliye bangale ke baahar subhash chandra bose sevashram kaa board par bhi laga he jis par likhaa he, aapkaa ghar, sabakaa ghar
 Kumar, however, charged the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) with the responsibility of demolishing the construction work and uprooting the window doors, but the CPWD rejected the charge and clarified that the former MP had just taken possession of the bungalow Has not transferred
 kumaar ne bataaya, ‘‘mangalvaar ko seepidblyoody ke adhikariyon kii maujuudagi main nirmaan kaary ko hataaya gaya tha or isse nikle khidki daravaaje bhi seepidblyoody kaa dal le gaya
 '' seepidblyoody ke ek adhikari ne pappu yadav ko aavantit bangale main aisi kisi karrwai se inkaar karte huye bataaya ki is tarah kii karrwai police kii maujuudagi main balpurvak bangala khaali karaate samay hoti he jabaki balpurvak bangala khaali karaane waalon kii suchi main pappu yadav kaa naam shaamil nahin he
 It is noteworthy that the Central Building Construction Agency CPWD is responsible for maintaining and maintaining the Lutyens' Delhi-based bungalows
 mantralay kaa sampada nideshaalay in bangalon ke aavanton ke baad aavanti ko kabja dilaane or aavanton radd hone par kabja waapas lene kii jimmedaari nibhaataa he
 After the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Directorate of Estates had issued notices to 230 former mps to vacate the bungalow
 oktober ke pehle saptaah tak bangale khaali nahin karne vaale lagbhag 50 saansadon ko kaaran bataao notice jari kar teen din main jawaab talab kiya gaya tha
 Pappu Yadav and his former MP wife Ranjit Ranjan were also included in this list
 supaul se purv saansad ranjit ranjan ko balavant raay manhata len main hi saat number bangala aavantit he
 On Monday, the directorate has started the process of forcibly evacuating the bungalows of 40 former mps who have not responded to the notice
 nideshaalay ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki pappu yadav or unki patni ne ek saptaah main awaas khaali karne kii soochna di thi, isaliye balpurvak awaas khaali karaane waalon kii suchi main unka naam nahin he
 The CPWD office of Lutyens Delhi has also acknowledged the knowledge of making additional arrangements for people to stay at Pappu Yadav's residence
 ek adhikari ne naam ujagar nahin karne kii shart par bataaya, ‘‘niyamon ke tahat vibhaag ne isse judi sabhi jaankariyaan loksabhaa sachivalay ko de di thi
 The initiative to take action against additional construction work is done at the level of the Ministry
 'adhikari ne kaha ki bangale main kii gayi todphod se seepidblyoody kaa koi sambandh nahin he lekin bangale ke kabje ke hastatanran ke samay is par sangyaan lekar niyamanusaar karrwai kii jaaegi
 Kumar said that Pappu Yadav engaged in flood relief works in Bihar is reaching Delhi till Friday
 iske baad donon bangalon kaa kabja seepidblyoody ko saunpa jayega
 Pappu Yadav and Ranjit Ranjan were not available to react on a large scale construction work and demolition in the government house

 'koi bhi meri beti kii pratibha kii jaanch kar saktaa he'maamle main echpiessi chairman manbir singh safai dete hue kehete hai ki sabhi chayan yogyata ko aadhaar maanakar kiye gaye hai

 Anyone can interview him and check his ability and talent
 kai baar aisa bhi hua he jab kisi bade raajnneetijna ke bachche safal nahin ho paae hai
 Both the daughters of HPSC member Jai Singh Sangwan could not make it to the final list
 'manbir singh aage kehete hai ki siem ke oesady emes chopra kii bhi ek hi beti kaa kamishan main chayan ho paaya

 is faisle ko sibiai ne dilli hoicourt main chunauti di thi
 - Patiala House Court's decision to return the document was out of jurisdiction and flawed
 - dilli hoicourt ne kaha ki chaanbin ke liye dastavej kii jaanch tay karne kaa adhikaar jaanch adhikari kaa he, aise main jaanch main dakhal kaa aadesh jari karnaa sahi nahin
 - The documents seized for investigation and investigation are still in the initial stage
 aise main nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar ja kar aadesh diya

 The 12th match of the current IPL on Sunday will be remembered for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's troublesome innings
 kathin pich par rajasthan royles (RR) kii anushaasit gendbaaji ke saamne chennai super kings (CSK) ke captain dhoni ne jabardast dhiraj dikhaate hue 46 gendon main naabad 75 ran banaae

 jaahir he ek dhoni kii pari kii vajah se chennai kii team apane gharelu maidan par 5 wicket par 175 ranon kaa chunauteepurn score khadaa karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Dhoni stepped to the crease when his team lost the wickets of Ambati Rayudu, Shane Watson and Kedar Jadhav on 27 runs in the fifth over
 chennai kii us pari ke dauraan ek aisa bhi vakt aayaa, jab dhoni bold hokar bhi 'dagout' nahin laute
 It is interesting that he did not even open his account at that time

 On the fourth ball of that over, something happened that all were taken aback

 An official of the Communist Party of China (CPC), aged 35, and academic Shu Chuan in China's southern city of Nanjing, was among the select 2,200 members of the CPC who gathered in Beijing's Great Hall of People amid the rainy morning of October 18
 Had happened
 us gupha sareekhe haul main lagbhag saadhe teen ghante tak shu bilkul sidhe or sachet baithe rahe or tamaam sahi maukon par jor se tali bajaane ke alaava bamushkil hi unhone apane sharir kii kisi bhi mansapeshi ko hilaayaa hoga
 CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping launched the party's important National Congress, to be held once in five years
 saadhe teen ghante chale marathon bhaashan main shu ne apane netaa ko ''ek nae yug kii shuruyaat kaa aahvaan karte hue suna
 In China, it is not uncommon for its leaders to announce the beginning of "dor"
 ek adarsh rajya kii taraf kadam badhaane main kii gai bhautik tarakkee ko pratibimbit karne vaale apane aankadon ko darj karaane kii communist parampara ke anuroop hi sipisi ke netaaon kii pichhali chaaron peedhishon ne bhi aisa hi kiya tha
 But even if this party's jargon was ignored, it could be clearly felt that a major change in Chinese politics was definitely being seen in the Beijing Congress
 congress ne us baat ko amali jama pahana diya jo shi ke pehle kaarykaal ke pichley paanch saal main nirantar jaahir hoti ja rahi thi
 China's ruling party laid the groundwork for the rise of its new helm and in the process it ignored the model of collective leadership that had given China the desired political stability for economic growth in the last two decades
 lihaaja 24 aktubar ko sampann hui congress ne apane pratyaashit das saal ke kaarykaal kaa aadha puraa kar chuke shi ko unke do purvavartiyon zaiyang jhemin or hu jinatao se zyada ooncha ohada party main pradaan kar diya
 Xi's "ideological contribution" was given place in the party constitution, which was dubbed the "xi Jinping notion of socialism for a new era with Chinese specialties"
 yah darasal deng shiyaoping ke rajya-niyantrit poonjeevaad ke sutara kaa hi vistaar he
 Xi is the third Chinese leader after Mao Zedong and Deng to be named in the constitution
 kuch logon ko yah baat maamuli lag sakati he lekin china kii raajnneeti main isaki khaas ahmiyat he
 In the case of Mao and Deng, this meant that he had effectively become the chairman of the party over his lifetime
 shi ke sandarbh main iskaa matlab yah he ki ab yah sawaal mahatvaheen ho jayega ki unka uttaradhikari koun hota he
 Steve Song of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the UK says it is now almost clear that Xi will retain control of the party even after the next Congress in 2022 — either party general secretary As or as "deng" the "supreme leader" when he used to show his strength from behind the scenes
 beijing main party adhikari or sarkari media ise pehle hi china ke liye ''tisare daur" kii shuruyaat qaraar de rahe hai
 "the era of Mao was about the beginning of a democratic republic and transforming China into a party-country," says Song
 deng kaa daur sudhaaron or desh ko bahari duniya ke liye kholane ke bare main tha
 Xi's phase, that is, the new phase, is to put the party and China's trust in front of the chosen path of development
 "raajnneetik vishleshak or beijing kii research form trivium china ke sah-sansthaapak trey metterwar kaa kahana tha ki congress main shi ne sahi myne main deng ke daur kii samaapti or shi ke daur kii shuruyaat kaa sanket de diya
 "this does not mean that Xi will remain formal even after 2022, but it is certain that even if he withdraws, his influence will remain and perhaps even decisive, in the same way as leaving all formal positions
 Deng was still making an impact after giving
 "shi yug ke china or baaki vishwa ke liye kya myne honge? yah to saaf he ki shi ke haathon main sari takat simat kar aa gai he lekin yah spasht nahin he ki ve us takat kaa istemaal kaise karenge
 There are more questions than answers in this context
 china ke communist jinhen ''pramukh antarvirodh" kahkar sambodhit karte he, shi ko gharelu va videshi morchon par unki lambii fehrist kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 During the Congress, Xi praised the rise of a more confident China and said that "china has come closer to a central role in this period and is making a more significant contribution to mankind
" "haalanki vaishvik str ke is aatmavishvaas ke saath hi saath gharelu str par asantosh va aalochana ke liye kam hoti sahishnutaa bhi najar aa rahi he
 Some people say that this intolerance has reached the level of insanity
 darjanon kaaryakartaaon ko congress se pehle beijing se baahar jabaran chuttee par bhej diya gaya taaki congress main koi vyavdhaan paidaa na ho
 Video streaming is popular among the youth but during the Congress thousands of its applications suddenly stopped broadcasting
 kai bade lokapriy tivi host ko, jinamein se kuch to mahaj cosmetics va handbag bechate hai, kisi tarah kii raay saamne na rakhane kii hidaayat di gai
 This is when Xi himself admitted that "physical and cultural needs" are increasing and at the same time "the demand for democracy, rule of law, honesty and justice is also increasing among the people of China
" yahaan is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana jaruri he ki shi va sipisi ke liye ''loktantr" kaa aashay mahaj party ke bheetar ke liye he yani ekal party shashan ke sakht daayre ke bheetar
 Even China's development model is inconsistent
 niryaat aadhaarit, infrastakchar-nirdeshit model kii hawa dhire-dhire nikal rahi he
 Due to this, the debt from large projects increased and the situation of pollution is becoming frightening
 isamen ek ujala paksh ubhartee navonmeshi arthvyavastha he jiskaa netritv alibaba va bidu jaisi nijee kshetra kii companiyaan kar rahi hai jinhen arthvyavastha ke kuch kshetron se rajya ke hat jane kaa phayda hua he
 Xi's country is willing to give billions of dollars for innovation, but it is not at all ready to give a free hand to China's innovative non-government economy
 shi kii vichaardhaarabeijing main bhitari sutara kehete hai ki shi in virodhabhaason se puri tarah waakif hai or isane teji se takat jutaney ke unke kadamon ko aadhaar diya he
 Very few people now understand that many people in the CPC have contributed to the emergence of Xi and bypassing the collective leadership as a result, the reason behind this is that they took a revolutionary approach to overcome these problems
 Feel the need
 jab 2012 main shi ne satta sanbhali thi to unhone sipisi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti chini logon kii ankhon main uski apni ghatati vaidhaniktaa ko mana tha
 It was not enough for the Chinese middle class to merely maintain a high economic growth rate
 bhrashtachar or pradooshan jaise muddon par jaagrukta or asantosh donon hi bad rahe the
 In response, Xi launched a campaign against corruption
 isamen unke kai pratidwandvi bhi nibata die gaye to duusari taraf kam se kam kendriya str par to netritv ke prati logon main vishwaas phir se paidaa hua
 The five-year blueprint that Xi presented on October 18 is the biggest indicator of how he wants to tackle these issues
 party ne ''shi jinping vichaar" ko apni naveenatam maardarshak vichaardhaara ke rup main apanaaya he jo deng ke sudhaaron or rajya-nirdeshit un sudhaaron kii agali kadi he jisane china ke vikaas ko gati di thi
 Xi has now focused on sustainable development rather than high
 lekin yah kahana aasaan he, karnaa mushkil
 Xi acknowledged in Congress that "serious problems arising from unbalanced and inadequate development need to be resolved" and that "the quality and impact of development has not been what it should have been
" " metterwar spasht karte hai ki, ''gharelu str par iskaa matlab yah he ki china kaa dhyaan ab sirf aarthik vikaas par hi nahin he
 He is looking towards achieving larger development goals, such as a cleaner environment, stronger social security network and better health facilities
 "shi ne gharelu morche par bhi apane saamne do lakshya rakhe hai jisase yah sanket miltaa he ki ve 2022 ke baad bhi party ko netritv dete rah sakate hai
 The first is that by 2035 they want to "establish a thriving society" and establish China as a "global leader in innovation"
 doosraa he ki 2050 tak china apana aadhunikeekaran puraa kar legaa or rashtriya takat or vaishvik prabhaav ke sandarbh main ve duniya main agrani ho jayega
 Another, and perhaps even bigger, challenge of the party is to improve the image of the party that still talks with marxism-leninism with the younger generation who are holding iphones
 congress main nanjing se suva pratinidhi shu chuaan is antarvirodh ko abhivyakt karte hai
 He teaches at Nanjing Aeronautics University, which works for China's space program, but heads the department of Marxist studies there
 shu badi nishtha ke saath vichet kaa istemaal karte hai—yah ek soshal media ap he jo fasebuk va whatsap kaa mishran he
 It is an extreme symbol of Chinese capitalism, allowing users to order food at their door from mcdonald's and book a dog spa for their Xi Tsu dogs
 vichet par shu us party kii achchhaayiyon kaa gungan karne vaale darjanon sandesh daalate hai jo marks va maao ko ishwar maanati he
 CPC is looking towards people like Shu to enhance its cause and make the image attractive
 vah is baat se waakif he ki party ke 8
 9 crore most recent members have not joined the party for any mission, but because they know that they can use the party's network to get a good job or to progress quickly
 apni vichet sakriyata kii vajah se online celebrity ban chuke shu kehete hai ki ''main yuvaaon ko yah ehsaas karaane kii koshish karata hum ki unki ngkshachataayen dur kii jaaengi
 "shoe receives hundreds of questions every day and shows his commitment to answer each of them within 48 hours
 shu sipisi kii maujuuda chunautiyon se waakif hai
 He says, "youth will accept an ideology only if it is used to solve their problems
" main chaatro ko samaajwaad ke saar ko zyada aakarshak va sweekaarya tareeke se samajhane kii koshish karata hum
 "chinese youth have turned away from politics after the 1989 Thiennanman check protest
 iske ulat ve sudhaaron ke baad ke china main sampannataa kii galakat hode main kud pade hai
 Shu says that the biggest concern he has to face with students is about jobs, not about politics
 shu ko mahasoos hota he ki in logon ko raajnneeti main zyada shirkat kerani chahie
 His clue was that since 1989, the party has reached the same point in many ways
 shi kii vichaardhaara kaa ek anya pahalu rashtrawaad ko lekar he
 They see this as a new important source of party legitimacy
 apane kaarykaal ke dauraan unhone baar-baar shrashtriya punarotthanya ke ''chini sapane" par apane focus par jor diya he
 At the same time, he has advocated for building a strong army and building a more reliable China at the global level
 shu kaa kahana he ki yah sandesh yuvaaon ko zyada apil karne vaala he
 The patriotism changes with generation
 nai peedi internet ke daur main he or vah is se zyada waakif he ki china jaise desh ke liye aisi uplabdhiyaan hasil karnaa or vishwa str par ubharna kitna mushkil he
 The more they are aware of this, the more they will love their country
 "vaishvik aakankshaayenshi ne in bhaawanaaon ko apane purvavartiyon se kahin zyada samajha he or isiilie ''punarotthana" ko apane sandesh ke kendriya bhav ke rup main rakhaa
 For China's neighbors and the rest of the world, this may mean that they should become accustomed to a more confident China
 yah shi ke pehle kaarykaal main dekhne ko mil chukaa he
 Especially as his important foreign policy initiative
 mahatvakankshi van belt, van road (obioar) yojana kii pahal main china ne sambhavatya pehali baar vaishvik netritv kii shabdaawalee kaa istemaal kiya
 Taylor Fravel, a leading expert on Chinese politics and military at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says an unanswered question about China's chief executive on the global stage is when China would like to play the role of a leader and just such a Not the country, which takes care of the institutions
 tab hi vah vaishvik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he yaa phir unke samaadhaan main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 He says, "it would mean taking risks that the rest of the countries cannot afford or paying the price that the rest of the countries don't pay
" china ab bhi aise kisi bhi morche par aguai se parhez karata he jahaan naakaami kaa jokhim he
 "mcarver says that the world should expect so much from China that it" will now be more assertive towards advancing its privileges globally
 " shi ke netritv main china ne jibooti main apana pehla videshi sainya adda sthapit kiya he or dur-daraaj ke samudr main apni pahunch badhaane ke liye chini nausena par zyada jor diya he
 OBOR has also provided a means for China to pursue its model
 shi ke raaj main alag yah he ki china ko apane model main nayaa aatmavishvaas mila he, itnaa ki vah use vikasshil deshon ke saamne vikalp ke bataur pesh karne laga he
 For this, he also points to the instabilities faced by Western democracies in the context of Trump and Breguit
 (apane pados main china kaa sarkari media apni daleelon ko aage badhaane ke liye bharat kii khaamiyon ko bhi nirantar ujagar karne main laga rahata he) jaisaa ki shi kehete hai, china ''aadhunikeekaran hasil karne ke liye baaki vikasshil deshon ke saamne nayaa vikalp pesh karata he jo apni swatantraaa banaae rakhte hue vikaas ko gati dena chaahate hai
 "leading Chinese strategic expert Hu Shisheng says that the most important objective of China's foreign policy will be to ensure the stability that is necessary for the fulfillment of China's domestic objectives
 hu kehete hai, ''jaisaa ki shi ne kaha, china ke paas america se rishte behatar banane ke ek hajaar kaaran hai lekin uske saath rishte kharaab karne kaa ek bhi kaaran nahin he
 "the same thing applies to relations with India
 ''agar chini sarkaar duniya main sabase zyada samasyaayein khadi karne vaale america ke saath bhi achche rishte banane kaa harsambhav prayaas karnaa chaahati he to yakeenan vah bharat ke saath bhi achche va sthir rishte chaahati he jo uskaa vishaal padosi desh he or jiske saath gharelu vikaas, kshetreey ekikaran va vaishvik shashan ke sandarbh main kai saajha aadhaar hai
 "at the same time, there is a fact that China has shown very little will to resolve disputes with its neighbors
 shi ne dakshin china samudr main takat dikhaane main vyaktigat rup se ruchi dikhaai he
 He ranks among the achievements of his five-year term of making China a controversial island, helping China consolidate control there
 china ne apane sabase chote padosi bhutan va bharat ke saath bhi tanaav ko janm dete hue ek aise ilaake main dhaancha khadaa karne kii koshish kii he jiske bare main sabhi pakshon kaa yah maananaa he ki us par vivaad ko abhi nibataya janaa baaki he
 It seems bullying that it is going to last
 shi jinping ne congress main bhi kaha ki ''kisi ko yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki china us baat ko bhi hajam kar jayega jo uske hiton ko nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Our party, country, people, armies and nation have changed in a unique way
 chini raashtra ek nae bhav ke saath purv main oonchai va majbootee se khadaa he
 "this is where the era of Xi begins

 Police sources said that in Chinhat, a 15-year-old boy Vivek gave his life by jumping in front of the moving train, while yesterday, a 37-year-old man named Basant Mishra committed suicide by jumping into the Gomti river in Gomti Nagar area

 Lord Shiva is called the God of Destruction
 bhagwaan shiv saumy or raudra donon roopon ke liye vikhyath hai
 According to Vastu Shastra, Gods and Goddess idols must be installed in the house, this does not bring negative energy in the house
 lekin murtiyon ko lagane ke niyam kaa paalan karnaa bhi jaruri hota he, galat tareeke se lagaai hui bhagwaan kii murti jivan main pareshaani kaa kaaran bhi ban sakati he

 jis tasviir main bhagwaan shiv maa parvati, bete ganesh or karthik ke saath hon vah tasviir ghar main lagaana kaaphi shubh hota he
 This does not cause trouble in the house and the children of the house are obedient
 2
 a picture of Bhole Shankar's posture of anger should never be placed in the house
 aisi tasviir vinaash kaa pratik hoti he
 3
 bhagwaan shiv kaa nivas kailash parvat uttar disha main he
 For this reason, it is best to install the idol or photo house of Shivji in the north
 uttar disha main shivaji kii photo yaa murti aisi jagah par lagaani chahie, jahaan ghar main aane-jane vaale sabhi log mahadev ke darshan kar saken
 This makes the relationship stronger
 4
 Such an idol or picture of Shivji should be installed in which he looks happy
 nandi par virajit yaa phir dhyaan kii mudra kii tasviren ghar main lagane se vaataavaran shant rahata he or bacchon main bhi ekagra hone kaa bhav badhata he
 5
 jahaan shivaji kii photo lagi ho, wo jagah ekadam saaf honi chahie
 Do not keep dirt around Shivji, otherwise the defects of the house may increase and money may be lost
 6
 For good married life, put family photo of Shiva ji at home
 7
 a picture of Lord Shiva's khadi mudra should never be installed in his home or office

 lekin agar ve aaj ke uttar pradesh main hote to unki soch hi badal jaati, gulab kii paribhaasha bhi badal jaati or ve majabuuran kah uthte, naam main bahut kuch rakhaa he
 Take the example of Mayawati

 haal hi main unke bhakton ne unhen 'aayran ladi' kahana shuru kiya

 ' hi likh sake

 According to the NGO, many children did not even know the name of their state
 eyesiaar ke anusaar ''sthiti dayaneey he
 Out of the 32 schools we visited, only six were having classes, teachers in the rest of the schools were not teaching children even though they had a good system, were getting grants and midday meals were also in operation
 ''uttar pradesh kii sakshartaa aaj bhi 56 pratishat he (rashtriya ausat 65 pratishat he)
 According to the ASER survey last year, 31 percent of Class 3 children were those who could read Class 1 books
 bihar or rajasthan main yah aankada kramshah 43
 7 percent and 34
 4 pratishat tha
 According to the survey, only 14 percent of Class 5 students in Uttar Pradesh could read the entire sentence in English (compared to 31 percent in Bihar

 Therefore, before talking about their success by making the Chief Minister an Iron Lady, teach the children to write their correct and full names so that they can say, understand and write the Iron Lady

 In which it has been demanded to give him martyr status

 The rajnath-modi dinner diplomacy failed in its objective to unify the party
 guuruuvaar ko jab loksabhaa main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh or sadan main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj kii maujuudagi main bhoomi adhigrahan bill par voting chal rahi thi to narendra modi party adhyaksh ke ghar par yojit ek dinar party main un donon kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 It was the first meeting of party mps after Modi became the chairman of the election campaign committee
 party rajnath singh ke ghar par saadhe 7 baje yojit honi thi
 All BJP mps from the Rajya Sabha including Gujarat Chief Minister and Arun Jaitley and Ravi Shankar Prasad reached the party venue by around 9:30 pm
 lekin rajnath singh, adwani or sushamaa samet party ke kai varisht netaa loksabhaa main bhoomi adhigrahan bill par voting main hi fanse rah gaye
 The party was to have a presentation on Mission 272 Plus
 haalanki loksabhaa main bijepi adhyaksh ne voting shuukravaar ko karaane ke liye aagrah bhi kiya lekin sarkaar ne nahin mana
 The voting night lasted until around 10:20
 udhar modi raah dekh rahe the or idhar sushamaa bill ke liye jairam ramesh kii tarif karne main lagi thim
 Rajnath, Advani and Sushma were able to reach the party at around 10:30
 tab tak arun jetali or navjot singh siddhu samet zyaadaatar saansad ja chuke the
 Now the question is whether Sushma, Advani and Rajnath had spoken in this regard? uttar pradesh main primary shikshakon ke skool na jane kii shikaayatein itani bad gai hai ki ab unke liye “selfi atendence” jaruri kii gai he
 That is, every morning, after reaching the teacher school, the officer has to take a selfie in the school background and post it
 subah 8 baje tak selfi nahin mili to uskaa vetan kategaa
 In Barabanki district, only 700 teachers have been paid so far
 tamaam shikshakon par ilzaam he ki ve skool nahin jate yaa apni jagah kam paise par kisi or ko padhaane bhej dete hai
 In the morning, a new view is seen in all primary schools of UP
 haathon main selfi stick lekar teacher 'teachernuma' gambhir pos banaakar selfi khinchate hai
 Sometimes they take selfies alone, sometimes with their fellow teachers
 phir use biese ke web pej par post karte hai
 Whose eye is on every selfie
 barabanki kii sidio kahati hai ki pehle to sirf aadhe teacher hi skool aate the
 Barabanki CDO Medha Roopam says that there were a lot of complaints that teachers live in Lucknow and Barabanki did not come to teach
 jab main yahaan par tainaat ho gai to maine bhi kuch inspection kiye
 Whenever i did inspections, 50 percent of the teachers were not coming
 teacher bataate hai ki selfi ke bhi kuch usul hai
 Smiling selfie is not taken
 photo main teacher jaisaa gambhir cheharaa hona chahie
 But teachers coming to school everyday are happy
 unka kahana he ki jo nahin aate unhen bhi utani hi selary milti he jitani aane waalon ko
 Now this discrimination will stop
 assistant teacher deepika singh ne kaha ki kahin-kahin par teacher aate nahin hai, or jo teacher aate hai unako uskaa khamiyaaza bhugatna padataa he
 So i think it's very good

 There is also a third angle in Karnataka and that is JDS, that is, the party of Devgowda wants to show this party that it is against BJP but also wants to keep the doors open for BJP
 devgauda jahaan yah dikhaate hai ki wo bijepi ke khilaaf hai vahiin kumaraswami kaa koi bharosa nahin he
 He has also gone with the BJP before
 yadi trishanku vidhaan sabha hui to jedies king mekar kii bhoomika main hogi
 For Karnataka, BJP has adopted the strategy of Sama, Daam, Dand, Bhed and has left no stone unturned
 khaskar lingayat voton kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue yediurppa ko mukhyamantri banane ke liye taal thonk rahe hai
 The Lingayat population in Karnataka is 17 per cent, which is very important for any party
 tippaniyan This is the reason why both Amit Shah and Rahul Gandhi have visited the Lingayat monasteries, and Siddaramaiah went one step and gave Lingayat a separate religion and minority status
 bijepi ne isko dekhte hue ek or gheraabandi kar rakhi he to apaar dhan bal ke saath reddy bandhu bijepi kii god main baithe chuke hai
 Sudhakar Reddy was not given a ticket, but his family members, including his brother Karunakara Reddy and Shomshekhar Reddy, have been given tickets
 yani karnataka to harhaal main bijepi ko chahie magar sabase bada sawaal he magar aakhir kyon? vajah dakshin main pair jamaana to he hi saath main yah chota sa rajya kerala jahaan abhi tak vampanth yaa congress kaa hi shashan rahaa he
 In recent times, the land of Kerala has been bled by the bloody struggle of the workers of BJP and Left parties
 
 According to one estimate, 44 BJP and 45 Left party and 17 Congress workers have lost their lives in Kerala
 yahi vajah he ki karnataka jeetne ke baad mishan kerala ke liye karnataka ko jeetna jaruri he
 The BJP will be happy to win Kerala from the hands of the Left and will give more self-satisfaction than winning Tripura and once Karnataka and Kerala fall in the hands of Amit Shah and the Prime Minister, both can say that their dream of making India Congress-free is almost fulfilled
 has gone

 The BJP has laid another siege in view of this, so the Reddy brothers have sat on the bjp's lap with immense wealth
 sudhakar reddy ko to tikat nahin diya gaya magar unke bhai karunakar reddy or shomshekhar reddy sahit parivaar ke 6 sadasyon ko tikat die gaye hai
 That is, the BJP wants Karnataka in every hurry, but the biggest question is, but why? The reason is to set foot in the south as well as this small state of Kerala where till now has been ruled by the Left or the Congress
 haal ke dinon main bijepi or vam dalon ke kaaryaktaaon ke khooni sanrghash se kerala kii dharti lahuluhaan hi hui he

 ek or bhartiya adhikari ne kaha ki bharat kaa yah ruukh he ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir main china dwaara kisi bhi tarah kaa nirmaan karnaa ‘avaidh’ he

 It was on 7th March 2018 and the occasion was the 65th convocation of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), in which President Ramnath Kovind was the chief guest of India
 raashtrapati uniwarsity main chaatro kii ore se kiye gaye swaagat se abhibhoot the
 a large number of students were also present at the reception, who had put more than half of their talents in their bag
 raashtrapati ne eemyu kii bhoomika ke kaside kadhate hue uniwarsity ke kai pratishthit purv chaatro ke naam yaad kiye
 He was confident that the students studying here are 'bharat Bhagya Vidhata' who will serve India in future
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne sar saiyad ahamed khan kii 200veen saalagirah par bataur mukhya atithi eemyu kii tarif kii thi or ise bhartiya rashtrawaad kii mukammal misaal bataaya tha, jahaan vibhinn majahabi, jaateey, kshetreey or bhashaayi prishthbhumi se aae chaatr rashtrawaad kii avadharana ko jite hai
 This time also it is AMU and nationalism, but the tone and postures are different

 In the media, the parodying voices have become more strident
 prime time televijan kii kuch surkhiyaan cheekhte hue pukaar rahi thim— 'jinna kaa jinn', 'eemyu jinna se kab aaazaad hoga', 'eemyu sansthaapakon kaa jashn manayega yaa jinna kaa'
 The issue of Mohammed Ali Jinnah's photograph in the Students' Union Hall of the University has covered the country's other bad or good news from its shadow
 yah sab 30 april kii ek chitthee se shuru hua, jo aligarh ke saansad satish gautam ne eemyu ke vaais chancelar (visi) professor tarik mansoor ko likhi thi
 In this, he asked the VC to remove the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah hanging on the wall of the students' union hall of the university
 isse pehle ki yah chitthee visi ke daftar ko milti, media main isaki charchaa hone lagi
 People of Hindu Jagran Manch, Hindu Yuva Vahini and abvp's allied organizations stormed the campus on May 2, without waiting for the letter's reply and without giving the university any time to decide
 unhone uniwarsity ke suraksha karmchaariyon ke saath maar-peet karne ke saath dhamkee bhare or aapattijanak naare lagaae
 This time of writing the letter, the violence and the planned debates in the electronic media has created an issue that has the strength and potential to polarize votes, especially when the Karnataka elections were so close and the 2019 mission is also visible Had been

 yah karrwai unke khilaaf tab kii gai jab ve campus main dakshinpanthi shohadon ke jabaran daakhil hone ke khilaaf exiar darj karwaane gaye the
 Due to this police action on the students of AMU, almost the entire campus came on the street of the university and with the arrest of the culprits demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident

 These pictures showing the huge crowd of students were misleading with captions, posing as mischievous proofs of their support for Jinnah
 hakeekat yah he ki eemyu kaa koi bhi chaatr yaa shikshak jinna kaa na to samarthak he or na hi hamdard
 Jinnah is history for every person in AMU - a painful history
 eemyu chaatro kaa ek naaraa unke rukh ko bayaan karata he, ''jinna itihaas he, aasthaa nahin

 aligarh muslim uniwarsity ne pehle bhi dushprachaar or purvagrahon kaa saamana kiya he
 In 2014, led by Satish Gautam, BJP leaders wanted AMU to celebrate the 128th birth anniversary of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh and announce a holiday on this day

 His invitation has been canceled
 ham jaanch kar rahe hai ki aakhir aisa kaise hua
 We would like to clarify that this person is not part of the official delegation of pm's visit to India, nor has he been invited by the Prime Minister's Office
 jaisaa ki aksar antarrashtriya dauron main hota he, kai baar log apane kharche par pahunch jate hai
 'interestingly, in view of the cold reception from India, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said that he wants a united India and does not support Khalistani secession

 CPIM Polit Bureau member Mohammad Salim said on this new development related to the party, 'we are not in competition or war
 communist party bijepi kii barabari nahin kar sakati, jise akele hi pichley saal corporate funding kaa 95% hissaa mila or ham corporate funding sweekaar nahin karte
 We can try to develop our cadre and increase our capabilities from the resources available
 'central kolkata main party mukhyalay ke paas ek 'state of da art' soshal media centre banaaya gaya he
 There is also a built-in studio for video content
 centre main samarpit kader kaa kor group party ke maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche ko nai shakl de rahaa he
 More than 20 party cadres are working day and night to increase cpim's digital reach
 inamen graphics diziner, content curators or software ejeeniyar shaamil hai
 CPIN Digital team member Abin Mitra says, "the motive behind the campaign is to mobilize digital volunteers in large numbers across the state
 hamen logon se jabardast pratikriya mili
 We received 700 to 1000 registrations per hour during peak traffic
 'party ne 31 july se 15 agast ke bich abhiyaan chalaaya
 The party claims that the campaign received 30 percent more response than the target it had set
 abin mitra kehete hai, 'hamen har us vyakti kii jarurat he jo sakriy kaaryakarta kii tarah party se nahin judate, phir bhi sipiiem se lagaav rakhte hai or samarthan karte hai
 These can be helpful in multiplying the party's influence
 'bataa den ki bharat main communist andolan ke dauraan raajnneetik sanchaar ke liye deevaaron par painting, poster or nukkad naatakon ko hi tarjeeh di jaati rahi
 It has always been considered a strong weapon for CPIM to take the masses together through social organizations
 lekin ab party nae jamaane se taal milaane ke liye takanic main bhi peeche nahin rahanaa chaahati
 Celebrities like Salil Chaudhary and Utpal Dutt and organizations like IPTA used to leave their distinct mark on communication with people, since then a lot of water has been flowing in Hooghly
 abhiyaan se jude sipiiem netaaon ne kaha ki ve apana kaam kar rahe hai
 He also cited the availability of data to be cheap, deep penetration of the Internet and the availability of smartphones easily
 mohammad saleem ne kaha, 'bijepi ne whatsap, fasebuk or twitor kaa 2014 se hi laabh uthaaya or ab wo use dabaanaa chaahate hai
 See what is happening in Kashmir vahaan puri tarah blike out he
 You are keeping people away from information
 isliye hamaara sandesh ooncha or saaf he
 We will raise issues of people like poverty, unemployment, hunger and economic suppression on which the mainstream media does not want to talk
 ' saleem ne daawa kiya ki ye party ke liye vichaaron kii ladaai he
 Continuous electoral failures have forced CPIM to embrace the same methods that it once rejected as an agent of capitalism
 kya is pahal se party apane khoe janaadhar ko paane main safal hogi yaa iske liye ab kaaphi der ho chuki he, ye aane vaala samay hi batayega
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday denied reports of any kind of file being sent from the Prime Minister's Office to Congress President Sonia Gandhi's office

 Manmohan Singh told the media that private conversations should not be misused to make money
 udhar, sonia ne bhi natwar singh kii kitaab main un par lagaae gaye aaropon ko khaarij karte hue guuruuvaar ko kaha ki vah sachai bayaan karne ke liye khud apni kitaab likhengi
 Natwar Singh, a foreign minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, accused Sonia in an interview that she had not made the decision not to accept the post of prime minister in 2004, on the sound of her 'inner soul' as claimed
 
 unhone kaha ki yah faisla unke bete rahul gandhi ke virodh par liya gaya tha jo kathith rup se apane pita rajeev gandhi or daadi indira gandhi kii pradhanmantri rahete hui hatya se chintit the
 Natwar also claimed that Sonia had access to government files and was brought to him by bureaucrat Pulok Chatterjee

 The government is preparing to bring fruit flavored tablets for children suffering from tuberculosis (TB)
 fruit flavored dawaaike aane se bacchon ko tibi kii kadavi or baari dose se raahat milegi
 These drugs will be available in 5 states from June
 in tablets flavor strawberry or orange honga
 These medicines are made keeping in mind the children
 nai dawaane munh main rakhte hi ghul jaaengi or bacchon ke liye inhen niglana bhi aasaan hoga
 Often children take tantrums while taking medicines and parents often have to break the pills according to the age of the child, many times the child may not get the right dose
 isliye in dawaain ko fruit flavored main banaaya gaya he
 Also, it has been prepared according to the requirement of children
 in davaaiyo kaa puraa dose lene se bacchon kii tibi kii beemaari kaa puraa ilaaj hoga
 These flavored tablets are produced in collaboration with WHO
 strot ke mutabik sarkaar kuch saalon main aisi hi tablets edlts ke liye bhi laa sakati hai
 According to government statistics, at present there are 2
5 million people suffering from TB in the country, 5 to 6% of them are children
 health ministry ke ek senior afasar ne bataaya june se 5 rajyon (sikkim, himachal, kerala, bihar or maharashtra) main ise shuru kiya jayega
 These medicines are made according to the weight of children
 davaaiyon kii 6 category banaaigai hai
 Different doses of flavored tablets have been fixed for these
 aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki saal ke aakhir tak 17 or rajyon main tibi peedit bacchon ko nai tablets milane lagengi
 Please tell the pressure made according to the convenience of children, currently, children being treated for TB have to take a dose of bitter tablets 4 times a day, like Adalds
 iske liye haivi dose kii tablets ko kai tukdon main katkar diya jaataa he
 Which is not a perfect dose for children
 saath hi bacchon ko puri khuraaq bhi nahin mil paati he
 And because of the bitter test, children also tantalize it
 aise main beemaari ko thik karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he

 This project is called the Prime Minister's Dream Project

 These are being made digital libraries
 jis par kul 24 karod rupye kharch kiye jaaenge
 Many questions arose on the plan
 
 
 sarkaar kaashi ko kioto kii tarah khubasurat banane kii koshish main he, lekin varanasi kii janata ke liye sarkaar kaa ye plan mushkil bharaa he
 Because the buildings are being razed here
 logon kaa kahana he ki is project se kaashi kii aitihaasik pahchaan hi khatre main pad gai he
 Work in 2019 after 1780 and 1853
 
 
 kaashi vishwanath mandir parikshetra ke vikaas varsh 1780, 1853 ke baad 2019 main ho rahaa he
 If we look at the history, then in 1780, this area was renovated by Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar
 unke baad maharaja ranjit singh ne 1853 main mandir ke shikhar sahit anya sthanon par sona lagavaaya tha
 Now the Prime Minister is developing this enclosure in 2019
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad guuruuvaar ko raashtra ko sambodhit kiya
 He called the removal of Article 370 a historic decision
 unhone kaha ki jo sapana sardaar patel kaa tha, baba sahib ambedkar kaa tha, doctor shyama prasad mukherjee kaa tha, atal bihari vaajapeyi or karodon deshbhakton kaa tha, wo ab puraa ho gaya he
 PM Modi said, 'as a nation, as a family, you, we and the whole country have taken a historic decision
 ek aisi vyavastha, jisaki vajah se jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke hamaare bhai-bahan anek adhikaron se vanchit the, jo unke vikaas main badi baadha thi, wo ab dur ho gai he
 He said that Sardar Patel, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Dr
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and crores of patriots had a dream to abolish Article 370
 wo ab puraa ho gaya he

 ye bhav aa jaataa he ki kuch badalegaa hi nahin, aise hi chalegaa
 There was a similar sentiment with Article 370
 usase jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke hamaare bhai-bahanon kii jo haani ho rahi thi, uski charchaa hi nahin hoti thi
 Surprisingly, if anyone spoke to anyone, no one could tell what was the benefit of Article 370 in the lives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 Read this: In the message to the nation, Modi said - Kashmir Why was it necessary to eliminate 370
 Modi said, 'there should be any government in our country, it works for the good of the country by enacting laws in Parliament
 kisi bhi dal kii sarkaar ho, kisi bhi gathbandhan kii sarkaar ho, ye kaary nirantar chalata rahata he
 There is a lot of debate, contemplation and discussion while framing the law, serious aspects are laid about its necessity
 is prakriya se guzarakar jo kanoon banataa he, wo puure desh ke logon kaa bhala karata he
 However, one cannot imagine that Parliament should enact such a large number of laws and they are not applicable in one part of the country
 'ise bhi padhein: jaaniye ladakh ke us paudhe ko, jise PM narendra modi ne bataaya sanjivani ke samanrashtra ke naam sandesh main piem modi ne kaha, 'aap ye jaanakar chaunk jaaenge ki jammu-kashmir main dashakon se, hajaaron kii sankhya main aise bhai-bahan rahete hai, jinhen loksabhaa ke chunaav main to vot daalane kaa adhikaar tha, lekin wo vidhansabha or sthaneey nikaay ke chunaav main matdaan nahin kar sakate the
 These are the people who came to India from Pakistan after Partition
 'unhone sawaal kiya, 'kya in logon ke saath anyaay aise hi chalata rahata? ham sabhi chaahate hai ki aane vaale samay main jammu-kashmir vidhansabha ke chunaav hon, nai sarkaar bane, mukhyamantri bane
 i assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that you will have the opportunity to choose your representatives in a transparent environment with a lot of honesty

 Did Ranveer get engaged to Deepika? Anees says that Akshay can do justice to this role of Rumtharanvir and Akshay is flying from this photo, but Akshay can do justice to this role, but Ranveer is also a good artist, so he can also cast Happy Singh

 Rashtriya Lok Samata Party is the constituent party of NDA in Bihar
 usee cote se upendra kushvaha kendra main mantri bhi hai, lekin endie ke koi ghatak dal ke bade netaa is maanav shrinkhalaa main nahin dikhe
 The party's national vice-president Shivananand Tiwari and state president Ramchandra Purve participated in it on behalf of RJD
 is maanav shrinkhalaa main argedy ke purv saansad sadhu yadav bhi dikhe, halaki wo abhi kisi party main nahin hai
 There is speculation that he will also join Kushwaha's party
 argedy ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne kaha kiupendra kushvaahane ek achche mishan ke liye ye maanav shrinkhalaa banaai thi
 The condition of education in Bihar is very bad and they organized this to attract the government's attention
 argedy bhi bihar me shiksha me sudhaar chaahati he, isliye ham shaamil hue
 Let me tell you that RJD did not participate in the human chain made against Nitish Kumar's dowry and child marriage
 kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki unhone sabhi partiyon ko isamen shaamil hone kaa nyotaa diya tha
 Workers of all NDA parties joined, but due to the busyness, no big leader could come
 argedy ke netaa aaye, iske liye main dhanyavad detaa hum

 Kushwaha also said that this was not a political program
 unke maanav shrinkhalaa main sabhi log rashtriya lok samta party ke jhande ke saath dikhe
 As elections are getting closer, political parties are playing their bets
 ek taraf upendra kushvaha kendra main mantri pad bhi tabatak bachaana chaahate hai, jabatak ki ek nayaa vikalp na khul jaye
 This is the reason why he is stepping in quite a lot
 unhen apni party kaa vistaar bhi karnaa he, loksabhaa main zyada siten bhi chahie, lekin jadyu ke phir se endie main shaamil hone se unki mushkil bad gai he

 mcgraw said after the under-23 coaching clinic at PCA Stadium, 'the biggest issue that i find not only in India, but in the whole world, is how hard they work
 agar ve ipel yaa australia main big bash khelkar thodi safalataa hasil kar lete hai to unhen lagata he ki ve ucch str ko hasil kar chuke hai or ve kadi mehnat karnaa band kar dete hai or bahut zyada abhyaas nahin karte hai

 There is no easy option or short cut for this
 kai baar main dekhtaa hum ki yuva cricketer kisi khaas str par pahunchate hai to achaanak hi hi unhen acha paisa milane lagata he or ve mehnat karnaa band kar dete hai
 Comments mcgra ne kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki paise ko hameshaa sarvocch praathamikta nahin deni chahie

 If they achieve some success by playing Big Bash in IPL or Australia, they feel that they have achieved a high level and they stop working hard and do not practice too much
 ' The former Australian bowler said, 'young bowlers have to be ready to work hard and then they will have to work harder to retain their place
 iske liye koi aasaan vikalp yaa short cat nahin he

 a post shared by Bollywood songs (@bollywood_tellywoodfanatic) on Dec 8, 2018 at 9:29 am PST jab se maharashtra main gau-vansh hatya bandi kanoon lagu hua he tab se soshal media par haahaakaar machaa hua he
 Some are frighteningly adding it to their freedom and some are weighing it with their feelings
 lekin hakeekat in donon ke bich kahin thahari hui he
 The first misunderstanding has been about the name of the Maharashtra government law
 ise naam diya gaya he gau-vansh hatya bandi kanoon, jisase aisa ahsaas hota he ki gau hatya ko lekar sarkaar pabandi lekar ai he
 Truth is something else
 1976 se maharashtra main gau maance nahin bik rahaa he
 There is already such a law here, according to which doing so is a crime
 maharashtra ke mumbai main to gau maance 1956 se hi band ho gaya tha
 At the request of Acharya Vinoba Bhave, the Quraysh and Hindu society of the city started banning beef meat
 ye wo daur bhi tha jab gaay ko lekar aksar dange ho jaaya karte the
 Then the non-vegetarian eaters of both religions tried to understand the feelings
 to phir sarkaar ab kya karnaa chaahati he? is naam main gau-vansh kyon joda gaya? sarkari daleelein hai ki uskaa makasad ab bail or bachhda ke maance par pabandi laana bhi he, taaki krishi pradhan gaanvon main bharpoor bail-bachade maujuud rahen
 These two carnivores fall into the category of 'beef'
 bif ke tahat bhens kaa maance bhi mana jaataa he
 But statistics show that 80 percent of the beef consumed in the state is bull and calf meat
 sirf 20 fisadi anya utpaada hai
 The big question is whether only one community consumes this beef? If you listen to the pleas of those who are standing in favor of this ban, then perhaps you will feel the same
 lekin hakeekat ye he ki iskaa seven karne vaale sab hai, dharm usamen kahin aade nahin aata
 This meat has already been part of the food of the hindu-muslim poor
 iske saboot bahutayat main maujuud rahe hai
 Many times untouchability in society has also depended on what kind of meat you eat
 lekin bada sawaal he ki kya rajya ke garib logon ke paas saste maansaahaar ke vikalp maujuud hai
 Just look at the difference in meat prices
 matan kaa bhav he 450 rupee kilo jabaki bif chal rahaa he kareeb 150 rupee kilo
 Cheap protein is necessary for the poor, but those who argue are saying that the poor and rich cannot eat other meat? The other side is saying that who will decide what we eat? Why food traditions will not be taken care of? in tamaam tarkon ke pare aise bhi log he jo kah rahe hai ki kisi bhi tarah kaa maance khaaya hi kyon jaae? When i have them, i have everything

 'many companies have also made presentations in this regard

 Only those who have a barcoded ticket will be able to use these gates
 railway jald hi aise mashiinon kaa trial karne vaala he
 If the experiment is successful, then this system will start at 25 stations in the country

 How to wash jeans with detergent even while choosing detergent? Mild detergents should always be used
 bleech yaa phir aise disergent ke istemaal se bachanaa chahie jisamen bahut adhik maatra main castic soda ho
 Cold waterwhen washing jeans you always have the fear that your jeans will not leave color? Jeans should always be washed with cold water or with lukewarm water
 genes ko kabhi bhi garm pani se nahin dhonaa chahie
 Jeans can shed color due to hot water, especially dark colored jeans
 garm pani se dhone par genes ke sikudne kaa khatra bhi bana rahata he
 Always wash jeans upside down
 While washing jeans, take special care that you reverse them before washing
 upree bhaag andar kii ore aa jaae or andar kaa bhaag upar kii ore
 This reduces the risk of damage to jeans
 genes par likhe instrection kaa paalanhar genes par saaf-saaf likhaa hota he ki use kaise dhonaa he or kaise rakhana he

 kahin aisa na ho ki aap jis kapade ke saath genes dho rahe hon wo rang chodta ho
 Otherwise your jeans may be defective
 genes ko haath se dhonaa hi sabase acha rahata he
 With this, jeans should not be washed too much or else its color will fade very quickly
