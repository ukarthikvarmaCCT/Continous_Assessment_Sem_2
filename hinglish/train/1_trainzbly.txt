jarur jab pradhanmantri modi kii baari aegi to kah denge ki tabhi to main ganga saaf karne kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Use of metaphors in politics gets disturbed
 iske baad congress ke netaaon ne giraftaar bhi di jiske baad chhod diya gaya
 The government operates at the behest of Nagpur
 sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya
 When the Congress was in power, the BJP used to allege that the Manmohan government runs at the behest of 10 Janpath
 donon kii baton se lagata he ki bharat sarkaar ishaare par chal sakati he
 This was the performance of the Congress about Uttarakhand and the bjp's agasta on Westland
 bijepi congress ke samay main lage apatkaal se lekar raashtrapati shasno kii yaad dilaane lagi
 Meanwhile, a decision came from the Supreme Court that President's rule will be lifted for two hours on May 10 and Harish Rawat will have to prove his majority in Uttarakhand assembly
 bahumat kii prakriya supreme court kii nigaraanee main hogi
 9 rebel mlas will not be able to participate in the trust vote
 isse congress utsahit ho gai
 Think if the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, what would have been the condition of the Congress that came to Jantar Mantar to save democracy
 congress or bijepi ne faisle kaa swaagat kiya, jaise donon ne shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 There was a chorus of women singing at Jantar Mantar, and there was an arrangement for a rough play
 congress puri taiyaari ke saath jantar mantar par ai thi
 There was a lot of change and newness in the poster but journalists were surprised to see a face that Robert Vadra was doing in the midst of saving democracy
 ve to privet citigen hai
 Somewhere there is no attempt to save them
 vaise unke khilaaf ho rahi jaanch kaa nateeja abhi tak saamne nahin aayaa he
 Due to this poster, Congress worker Jagdish Sharma also got a lot of coverage
 congress ko jawaab dena padaa ki jagadish sharma ne yah poster bina manyata ke laga die
 Priyanka Gandhi's picture was also seen here
 isi bich yah bhi dekha gaya ki ek noujvaan congress saansad ambika soni ke saath selfi lene ke liye sangharshrat he
 Ambika ji also blushed
 yuvak selfi lene main safal rahaa he yaa nahin gyaat nahin he
 These demonstrations also gave Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a chance to say something
 pehali baar kii sarkaar main jab mukhyamantri rahete hue kejariwal dharne par baithe the tab kaaphi aalochana hui thi or majaak bhi uda tha ki kahin siem bhi dharne par baithta he
 Later research began to be done about who had sat earlier
 congress bijepi ke dharna pradarshan se kejariwal ko mauka mila ki apana purana hisaab chuktaa kiya jaae
 Both BJP and Congress are dharna parties
 donon har din dharna detii he
 Today BJP is on strike against itself
 sirf aap he jo garvenans par khare utar rahi he
 This is just to remind you that what was happening about the dharnas was happening in Delhi when the strike was going on
 dharna-pradarshan se pataa chalata he ki hamaara loktantr kitna jeevant he
 It also shows that the system is alive and has come in a post-death struggle while fighting in front of democracy
 kai baar jab duusare pradarshan karte hai to ham dhyaan nahin dete
 Forget that we can also have our turn
 jab hamaari baari aati he tab ham bhi vahi shikaayat karne lagate hai ki is loktantr kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Why doesn't anyone matter here
 jantar mantar par guuruuvaar ko anganwari kaaryakartaaon ne pradarshan kiya tha
 But they would not have had live coverage
 dilli, haryana, punjab, upi, rajasthan se saikadon anganwari varkar ain thim
 Their demand is that Anganwadi workers should be made permanent and get the status of government employees
 varkar ko 24 hajaar kaa vetan mili or helper ko 18 hajaar maheenaa
 ICD s scheme money is being reduced from the previous budget
 isse poshaahar par asar pad rahaa he
 Delhi's Anganwadi workers also performed on ITO on Friday
 bahut mushkil se ham itio vaale pradarshan kii tasviir hasil kar paae
 It was learned that for the last forty years, Anganwadi women across the country have been protesting against their demands
 rajyon kii rajdhani main dharna hota he
 There is a dharna coming to Delhi
 samaaj va bal kalyaan mantri ko gyaapan diya jaataa he or uske baad phir agle pradarshan kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he
 That is why i said that as a citizen many times we become indifferent to such necessary picketing-demonstrations
 kai baar aise dharna pradarshnon se utsahit ho jate hai jahaan asli mudde kam hote hai, narebaaziyaan zyaada hoti hai
 The picture of the performance of Jantar Mantar and the Gandhi statue of the Parliament complex will be on the front page
 anganwari workaron ke pradarshnon kii tasviren aap khud bhi khojie
 Which page number is it on
 15 farvari 2016 ko bhi ek pradarshan hua tha
 Then we asked Situ how long you have been protesting for Anganwadi workers, then some recent demonstrations started counting that women were sitting on the hunger strike of 2006
 2008 main do karod hastakshar kiye the
 In 2010, 17000 workers staged a two-day and two-night agitation
 2011 main sansad tak march kiya
 On 10 July 2013, four lakh Anganwadi workers took to the streets across the country and celebrated Black Day
 2014 main 2 karod dastakhat ke saath sansad tak march nikaala
 In 2015 also marched till Parliament
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he
 Anganwadi has 14 lakh centers and 27 lakh workers across the country
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 BJP mps were sitting on a dharna inside the Parliament complex, while at Jantar Mantar, Congress was performing Bachao Democracy
 aisa laga ki donon party ke netaa chat par khadey hokar dekh rahe the ki kiske pradarshan me zyada bheed ai he or kahaan joardaar naare lag rahe hai
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also came in the Congress performance
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi pahunche
 Jantar Mantar's performance was shown live on channels
 congress ke netaa manch se bol rahe the ki desh main loktantr kaa galaa ghonta ja rahaa he
 Institutions are in possession of the Union
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki desh main do hi logon kii chalati he
 Prime Minister Modi and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 sonia gandhi se lekar sabhi netaaon ne arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ko lekar modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Sonia Gandhi said that she is not afraid of anyone
 loksabhaa ke andar jyotiraditya sindhiya kah gaye ki sonia gandhi sherni hai
 There is a lioness
 sherni ko khadedoge to uttar kya hoga aapako maaloom chal jayega
 If a fifty-six inch chest is a bad metaphor in a democracy, it is also a bad metaphor to present leaders like a lioness
 yah meri nijee raay he
 Manmohan Singh said that i want to tell the Modi government that the Congress is like a flowing Ganga
 aap chaahe ise badnaam kiijie yaa kuch kiijie yah apana rasta nahin badalegi
 The metaphor of Ganga also gave the BJP a chance
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne jawaab de diya ki aap kyon chintit hai
 i did not name anyone
 aap hi jaanate honge ki ganga kahaan ja rahi he
 Tyagi and Khaitan are small people who have just washed their hands in the flowing Ganges
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi ganga ko lekar bhavuk hote the, chunaav haarane ke baad manmohan singh ganga ko lekar bhavuk hue to bijepi ko bhi hairaani hui hogi
 Mother Ganga must have been confused in this politics
 jarur jab pradhanmantri modi kii baari aegi to kah denge ki tabhi to main ganga saaf karne kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Use of metaphors in politics gets disturbed
 iske baad congress ke netaaon ne giraftaar bhi di jiske baad chhod diya gaya
 The government operates at the behest of Nagpur
 sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya
 When the Congress was in power, the BJP used to allege that the Manmohan government runs at the behest of 10 Janpath
 donon kii baton se lagata he ki bharat sarkaar ishaare par chal sakati he

 bahumat kii prakriya supreme court kii nigaraanee main hogi

 isse congress utsahit ho gai
 Think if the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, what would have been the condition of the Congress that came to Jantar Mantar to save democracy

 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 Jantar Mantar's performance was shown live on channels
 congress ke netaa manch se bol rahe the ki desh main loktantr kaa galaa ghonta ja rahaa he
 Institutions are in possession of the Union
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki desh main do hi logon kii chalati he
 Prime Minister Modi and Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 sonia gandhi se lekar sabhi netaaon ne arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ko lekar modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii
 Sonia Gandhi said that she is not afraid of anyone
 loksabhaa ke andar jyotiraditya sindhiya kah gaye ki sonia gandhi sherni hai
 There is a lioness
 sherni ko khadedoge to uttar kya hoga aapako maaloom chal jayega
 If a fifty-six inch chest is a bad metaphor in a democracy, it is also a bad metaphor to present leaders like a lioness
 yah meri nijee raay he
 Manmohan Singh said that i want to tell the Modi government that the Congress is like a flowing Ganga
 aap chaahe ise badnaam kiijie yaa kuch kiijie yah apana rasta nahin badalegi
 The metaphor of Ganga also gave the BJP a chance
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne jawaab de diya ki aap kyon chintit hai
 i did not name anyone
 aap hi jaanate honge ki ganga kahaan ja rahi he
 Tyagi and Khaitan are small people who have just washed their hands in the flowing Ganges
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi ganga ko lekar bhavuk hote the, chunaav haarane ke baad manmohan singh ganga ko lekar bhavuk hue to bijepi ko bhi hairaani hui hogi
 Mother Ganga must have been confused in this politics
 jarur jab pradhanmantri modi kii baari aegi to kah denge ki tabhi to main ganga saaf karne kii baat kar rahaa hum
 Use of metaphors in politics gets disturbed
 iske baad congress ke netaaon ne giraftaar bhi di jiske baad chhod diya gaya
 The government operates at the behest of Nagpur
 sonia gandhi ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya
 When the Congress was in power, the BJP used to allege that the Manmohan government runs at the behest of 10 Janpath
 donon kii baton se lagata he ki bharat sarkaar ishaare par chal sakati he
 This was the performance of the Congress about Uttarakhand and the bjp's agasta on Westland
 bijepi congress ke samay main lage apatkaal se lekar raashtrapati shasno kii yaad dilaane lagi
 Meanwhile, a decision came from the Supreme Court that President's rule will be lifted for two hours on May 10 and Harish Rawat will have to prove his majority in Uttarakhand assembly
 bahumat kii prakriya supreme court kii nigaraanee main hogi
 9 rebel mlas will not be able to participate in the trust vote
 isse congress utsahit ho gai
 Think if the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, what would have been the condition of the Congress that came to Jantar Mantar to save democracy
 congress or bijepi ne faisle kaa swaagat kiya, jaise donon ne shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 There was a chorus of women singing at Jantar Mantar, and there was an arrangement for a rough play
 congress puri taiyaari ke saath jantar mantar par ai thi
 There was a lot of change and newness in the poster but journalists were surprised to see a face that Robert Vadra was doing in the midst of saving democracy
 ve to privet citigen hai
 Somewhere there is no attempt to save them
 vaise unke khilaaf ho rahi jaanch kaa nateeja abhi tak saamne nahin aayaa he
 Due to this poster, Congress worker Jagdish Sharma also got a lot of coverage
 congress ko jawaab dena padaa ki jagadish sharma ne yah poster bina manyata ke laga die
 Priyanka Gandhi's picture was also seen here
 isi bich yah bhi dekha gaya ki ek noujvaan congress saansad ambika soni ke saath selfi lene ke liye sangharshrat he
 Ambika ji also blushed
 yuvak selfi lene main safal rahaa he yaa nahin gyaat nahin he
 These demonstrations also gave Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a chance to say something
 pehali baar kii sarkaar main jab mukhyamantri rahete hue kejariwal dharne par baithe the tab kaaphi aalochana hui thi or majaak bhi uda tha ki kahin siem bhi dharne par baithta he
 Later research began to be done about who had sat earlier
 congress bijepi ke dharna pradarshan se kejariwal ko mauka mila ki apana purana hisaab chuktaa kiya jaae
 Both BJP and Congress are dharna parties
 donon har din dharna detii he
 Today BJP is on strike against itself
 sirf aap he jo garvenans par khare utar rahi he
 This is just to remind you that what was happening about the dharnas was happening in Delhi when the strike was going on
 dharna-pradarshan se pataa chalata he ki hamaara loktantr kitna jeevant he
 It also shows that the system is alive and has come in a post-death struggle while fighting in front of democracy
 kai baar jab duusare pradarshan karte hai to ham dhyaan nahin dete
 Forget that we can also have our turn
 jab hamaari baari aati he tab ham bhi vahi shikaayat karne lagate hai ki is loktantr kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Why doesn't anyone matter here
 jantar mantar par guuruuvaar ko anganwari kaaryakartaaon ne pradarshan kiya tha
 But they would not have had live coverage
 dilli, haryana, punjab, upi, rajasthan se saikadon anganwari varkar ain thim
 Their demand is that Anganwadi workers should be made permanent and get the status of government employees
 varkar ko 24 hajaar kaa vetan mili or helper ko 18 hajaar maheenaa
 ICD s scheme money is being reduced from the previous budget
 isse poshaahar par asar pad rahaa he
 Delhi's Anganwadi workers also performed on ITO on Friday
 bahut mushkil se ham itio vaale pradarshan kii tasviir hasil kar paae
 It was learned that for the last forty years, Anganwadi women across the country have been protesting against their demands
 rajyon kii rajdhani main dharna hota he
 There is a dharna coming to Delhi
 samaaj va bal kalyaan mantri ko gyaapan diya jaataa he or uske baad phir agle pradarshan kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he
 That is why i said that as a citizen many times we become indifferent to such necessary picketing-demonstrations
 kai baar aise dharna pradarshnon se utsahit ho jate hai jahaan asli mudde kam hote hai, narebaaziyaan zyaada hoti hai
 The picture of the performance of Jantar Mantar and the Gandhi statue of the Parliament complex will be on the front page
 anganwari workaron ke pradarshnon kii tasviren aap khud bhi khojie
 Which page number is it on
 15 farvari 2016 ko bhi ek pradarshan hua tha
 Then we asked Situ how long you have been protesting for Anganwadi workers, then some recent demonstrations started counting that women were sitting on the hunger strike of 2006
 2008 main do karod hastakshar kiye the
 In 2010, 17000 workers staged a two-day and two-night agitation
 2011 main sansad tak march kiya
 On 10 July 2013, four lakh Anganwadi workers took to the streets across the country and celebrated Black Day
 2014 main 2 karod dastakhat ke saath sansad tak march nikaala
 In 2015 also marched till Parliament
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he
 Anganwadi has 14 lakh centers and 27 lakh workers across the country
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly

 Then we asked Situ how long you have been protesting for Anganwadi workers, then some recent demonstrations started counting that women were sitting on the hunger strike of 2006
 2008 main do karod hastakshar kiye the
 In 2010, 17000 workers staged a two-day and two-night agitation
 2011 main sansad tak march kiya
 On 10 July 2013, four lakh Anganwadi workers took to the streets across the country and celebrated Black Day
 2014 main 2 karod dastakhat ke saath sansad tak march nikaala
 In 2015 also marched till Parliament
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he

 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice

 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March

 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU

 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors

 There was a chorus of women singing at Jantar Mantar, and there was an arrangement for a rough play
 congress puri taiyaari ke saath jantar mantar par ai thi
 There was a lot of change and newness in the poster but journalists were surprised to see a face that Robert Vadra was doing in the midst of saving democracy
 ve to privet citigen hai
 Somewhere there is no attempt to save them
 vaise unke khilaaf ho rahi jaanch kaa nateeja abhi tak saamne nahin aayaa he
 Due to this poster, Congress worker Jagdish Sharma also got a lot of coverage
 congress ko jawaab dena padaa ki jagadish sharma ne yah poster bina manyata ke laga die
 Priyanka Gandhi's picture was also seen here
 isi bich yah bhi dekha gaya ki ek noujvaan congress saansad ambika soni ke saath selfi lene ke liye sangharshrat he
 Ambika ji also blushed
 yuvak selfi lene main safal rahaa he yaa nahin gyaat nahin he
 These demonstrations also gave Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a chance to say something
 pehali baar kii sarkaar main jab mukhyamantri rahete hue kejariwal dharne par baithe the tab kaaphi aalochana hui thi or majaak bhi uda tha ki kahin siem bhi dharne par baithta he

 Both BJP and Congress are dharna parties

 Today BJP is on strike against itself
 sirf aap he jo garvenans par khare utar rahi he
 This is just to remind you that what was happening about the dharnas was happening in Delhi when the strike was going on
 dharna-pradarshan se pataa chalata he ki hamaara loktantr kitna jeevant he
 It also shows that the system is alive and has come in a post-death struggle while fighting in front of democracy
 kai baar jab duusare pradarshan karte hai to ham dhyaan nahin dete
 Forget that we can also have our turn
 jab hamaari baari aati he tab ham bhi vahi shikaayat karne lagate hai ki is loktantr kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Why doesn't anyone matter here
 jantar mantar par guuruuvaar ko anganwari kaaryakartaaon ne pradarshan kiya tha
 But they would not have had live coverage

 Their demand is that Anganwadi workers should be made permanent and get the status of government employees

 There is a dharna coming to Delhi
 samaaj va bal kalyaan mantri ko gyaapan diya jaataa he or uske baad phir agle pradarshan kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he
 That is why i said that as a citizen many times we become indifferent to such necessary picketing-demonstrations

 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive

 Both BJP and Congress are dharna parties

 Today BJP is on strike against itself
 sirf aap he jo garvenans par khare utar rahi he
 This is just to remind you that what was happening about the dharnas was happening in Delhi when the strike was going on
 dharna-pradarshan se pataa chalata he ki hamaara loktantr kitna jeevant he
 It also shows that the system is alive and has come in a post-death struggle while fighting in front of democracy
 kai baar jab duusare pradarshan karte hai to ham dhyaan nahin dete
 Forget that we can also have our turn

 On Thursday, Anganwadi workers performed at Jantar Mantar
 magar inkaa live kawarej nahin hua hoga
 Hundreds of Anganwadi workers came from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan
 inaki maang he anganwari workaron ko sthai kiya jaae or sarkari karmchaaree kaa darja mili
 The worker gets a salary of 24 thousand and the helper gets 18 thousand months
 pichley bajet se aisidi es yojana kaa paisa kam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is affecting nutrition
anganwadi workers of shuukravaar ko bhi itio par dilli ke anganwari workaron ne pradarshan kiya
 Very rarely did we get the picture of the ITO performance
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he

 15 farvari 2016 ko bhi ek pradarshan hua tha
 Then we asked Situ how long you have been protesting for Anganwadi workers, then some recent demonstrations started counting that women were sitting on the hunger strike of 2006
 2008 main do karod hastakshar kiye the
 In 2010, 17000 workers staged a two-day and two-night agitation
 2011 main sansad tak march kiya
 On 10 July 2013, four lakh Anganwadi workers took to the streets across the country and celebrated Black Day
 2014 main 2 karod dastakhat ke saath sansad tak march nikaala
 In 2015 also marched till Parliament
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he
 Anganwadi has 14 lakh centers and 27 lakh workers across the country
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters

 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya

 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he

 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to

 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana

 Now tell me one thing

 Do political parties leave the public after the election

 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action

 isaki gati 115 se 130 kimi prati ghanta tak ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, the Gujarat administration is on high alert to deal with the cyclone 'vayu', which is likely to reach the coast near Veraval on Thursday
 adhikariyon ne yah jaankaree di

 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne seemaa par pravasi pariwaron ko alag karne par roak lagane vaale ek shaskeey aadesh par hastakshar kar die
 Trump signed after signing that the order is about keeping families together
 mujhe pariwaron kaa bichhadnaa acha nahin lagata
 Let us know that Trump's controversial decision to separate the migrant families was widely criticized, after which he took this step
 trump kii patni or america kii pratham mahilamelania trampane hi unki is niti aalochana kii thi
 It is rarely seen when Melania expresses her opinion on such policy issues, but she finds this policy so close that through her spokesperson she said, she hates to see children being separated from their families
 bataa den ki trump kii yah niti america seemaa par pravasi maataaon-pitaaon or unke bacchon ko alag hone ke vishay par he
 Laura Bush, the wife of former Republican President George W
 Bush, also targeted Trump's policy, calling the move to separate children from their parents cruel and unethical
 saath hi unhone kaha tha ki isse unka man hataash hota he
 If we talk about the statistics of the Home Security Department, between April 19 and May 31, about 2,000 children have separated from their parents and guardians, who have been kept in some special centers
 yah trump kii jaraa bhi bardaasht nahin karne kiavrajan nitike kaaran hua
 The debate in the US intensified on this issue when pictures and stories of children facing separation from parents came to the fore, which were told about Trump's disputed immigration policy
 bataa den ki trump prashasan ne avaidh pravaasiyon ko lekar seemaa par jiro tolerance kii avrajan niti apanaai, jiske tahat avaidh taur par america main ghusane vaale har vayask vyakti par sangheey aparaadhon kaa cese darj kar unhen jail bheja jaataa tha or bacchon ko unase alag kar castady centre bhej diya jaataa tha

 PM Modi addressed the Statue of Unity in Kevadia and said that with the removal of Article 370, our government has paid a true tribute to Sardar Patel
 is dauraan piem ne nae jammu-kashmir par khulkar baat kii or kaha ki ye sirf jameen par lakeer khinchne ke liye nahin hua he
 On the occasion of National Unity Day, what PM Modi said on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, read here
 
 
 - anuchhed 370 ne ek asthai diwaar bana rakhi thi, jisane kashmir main algaavvaad ko badhaava diya
 The PM said that today i am giving the account to Sardar Saheb, the wall which was incomplete, has been demolished
 kabhi sardaar patel ne kaha tha ki agar kashmir kaa masalaa unke paas hota to use sulajhane main der nahin lagati
 PM: We are also happy that from today, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are moving towards a new future
 haal hi main vahaan, block dawalpment council ke chunaav main 98 pratishat panchon-sarpanchon kii bhagidaari ek bada sandesh he
 - PMO India (@pmoindia) October 31, 2019 - Terrorism killed 40 thousand people in the Valley, Kashmir had got terrorism only since 370
 puure desh main jammu-kashmir main hi anuchhed 370 thi or sirf vahaan par hi aatankwaad pair pasaar rahaa tha
 - The Parliament of the country took a decision on 5 August and paid tribute to Sardar Saheb
 aaj se hi jammu-kashmir or ladakh nae itihaas kii ore kadam badha rahe hai
 Now, complaints will end on the basis of region and a new era of development will begin in Kashmir
 - jammu-kashmir main ab sarkaar giraane kaa khel nahin hoga or raajnneetik sthirataa aegi
 The new system there is not just to draw a line on the ground, but is a meaningful beginning to build a link of trust

 uski kismat acchhee thi ki wo ek khaufnak serial killer ke changul main funsane ke baavjood bal-bal batch gai
 Otherwise, she would be the eighth victim of her future murderer
 ji haa, kahani he america ke south carolina kii, jahaan ek riski oparation main police ne container main chhupaai gai ladki ko rescue kiya
 That murderer had taken this girl hostage, while her boyfriend was killed

 container ke bilkul aakiri chor par ek ladki zajiron ke sahare bandhi milti he
 Some are tied so far away from standing up that she cannot remove the container from the wall to her neck
 lohe kii zanjiron se kisi insaan ko yun baandh kar rakhane ke kisi vaakye ke bare main sochna bhi mushkil lagata he
 But something similar happened to this girl named Kaila Brown, who was killed by a serial killer in South Carolina
 shukr is baat kaa he ki pulisavaalon ko vakt rahete brown ko bandhak banaae jane kaa pataa chal gaya
 The policemen rescued her, or she might have been killed by the person holding her hostage
 serial kiling ke saath-saath brown ko bandhak banane ke ilzaam main america police ne tod kholep naam ke ek shaks ko giraftaar kar adaalat main pesh karne ke saath-saath ye video relies kiya he
 Actually, Kaila Brown and her boy friend Charlie Carper mysteriously disappeared last year

 Now in view of all the evidence, the American court has sentenced him to life imprisonment

 In the areas of western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, there is a tradition of putting the bride in maternal lap in a car or a dolly at the time of farewell during marriage
 daarul ulum devband ne fatwa jari karte hue is rasm ko gaiyr islamic bataaya or khatm karne kii baat kahi he
 Darul Uloom has argued that while playing this ritual, lust can come in any of the minds of either uncle or niece
 fatve main kaha gaya he ki maam-bhanji kaa rishta pavitra hota he
 In such a situation, instead of taking maternal uncle's niece to the dock during the farewell, it would be better if the bride goes by herself or her mother takes her
 fatwa main kaha gaya he ki shaadi ke dauraan bhanji badi ho chuki hoti he aise main mamaa kaa god main uthaanaa sahi nahin he
 This kind of tradition cannot be accepted in the eyes of the Islamic Sharia
 rasm nibhaate vakt mamaa yaa bhanji ke man main kaam-vaasana jaag sakati he
 In such a situation, such tradition should be eliminated
 bhanji ko god main uthaakar vidaa karne kii pratha ke alaava daarul ulum ne ek or fatwa jari kiya he

 Congress does politics in the name of being secular

 Saqlain Mushtaq admits that the Indian selectors have ignored the earlier performance of Bhajji (417 wickets in 103 Tests, 269 wickets in 236 odis and 24 wickets in 27 T20s)
 asia cap or world tii-20 main team india kaa hissaa to hai, lekin plaing XI main unki jagah banati nahin najar aati he
 Especially the presence of r Ashwin in form makes Bhajji's circumstances out of the team

 Saqlain, who invented the 'second', believes that r Ashwin is a World Class bowler, but Harbhajan has not been able to make a place in the last seven international T20 matches, Saqlain seems upset with this
 tippaniyan Saqlain says that because of Ashwin, pressure has been put on Bhajji keeping him out of all matches
 unke mutabik bhajji abhi bhi ek world class gendbaaj hai
 He says that Bhajji is not doing well with his confidence by not taking him out in the match
 unhen lagata he ki bhajji ko thode maukey dekar world tii-20 tak ke liye unke hausale ko barkaraar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 World Cup winning captain MS Dhoni has spoken about experimentation and giving opportunities to players during the Asia Cup, but whether or not Bhajji also fits in his scheme is the only answer

 According to him, Bhajji is still a World Class bowler

 Controversy has been going on between Justice Karnan and the judges of the Supreme Court for some time
 bhartiya nyaaypalika ke itihaas main ye pehla mauka he jab supreme court ke jajon ko nichali adaalat ke kisi nyaayadhish ne sajaa sunai he
 While pronouncing the sentence under the SC-ST Act, Justice Karnan said that all the eight judges of the Supreme Court together violated the amended provisions of the SC-ST Act of 1989 and the same Act in 2015
 chif justise je es khehar ke alaava jin jajon ko sajaa sunai gai he unke naam hai; justise deepak mishra, justise chelmeshwar, justise ranjan gogoi, justise madan lokur, justise pinaki chandra ghosh or justise courian ghosh
 All these judges were members of the bench that started the process of contempt against Justice Karnan taking automatic cognizance
 iske alaava justise karnan ne apane faisle main justise bhaanumati ko bhi sajaa sunai he
 According to Justice Karnan, Justice Bhanumati along with Justice Khehar prevented him from fulfilling his judicial and administrative responsibilities
 justise karnan ne kya kaha?apane faisle main justise karnan ne sabhi jajon ko jati ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav kaa doshi paaya
 According to him, all the eight judges used their judicial and administrative rights to insult a Dalit judge
 justise karnan ne faisle main mana ki in jajon ke aadesh in aaropon kii pushti karte hai
 Justice Karnan delivered the verdict at his temporary residence in Rosdale Tower, Kolkata

 Justice Karnan also said that the decision he had given on April 13 to pay a fine of Rs 14 crore to 7 judges in the bench is still intact
 unhone supreme court ke register general ko aadesh diya ki ye rakam in jajon kii tankhwaah se vasuul kii jaae
 In addition, he ordered Justice Bhanumati to pay a fine of 2 crore
 kya tha vivaad?darasal justise karnan ne madras hoicourt or supreme court ke kai jajon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaae the
 a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court, taking suo motu cognizance of the letters written by Justice Karnan in this regard, had initiated a contempt case against him
 farvari main sarvocch adaalat ne unpar kisi bhi tarah ke prashasnic or nyaayik faisle lene kii roak laga di thi
 Justice Karnan appeared in the Supreme Court on March 31 in this connection
 aisa karne vaale wo kisi bhi hoicourt ke pehle jaj the

 Union Home Minister Amit Shah has described the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's methods of dealing with the problem of Jammu and Kashmir as wrong
 unhone ravivaar ko kaha ki kashmir ke mudde ko sanyukt raashtra (UN) lekar janaa nehru kii sabase badi bhul thi
 Shah said that the entire world has supported the removal of most of the provisions of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir ghati main ab koi pratibandh nahin he or vishwaas jataayaa ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara paanch agast ko uthaaye gaye saahasik kadam kii vajah se jammu-kashmir agle 10 saal main desh kaa sabase viksit kshetra hoga
 Amit Shah was speaking at a program organized by 'sankalp Formar Civil Servants Forum' at Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML)
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki bharat sanyukt raashtra charter ke anuchhed 35 ke tahat sanyukt raashtra gaya tha jo vivaadit bhoomi se sambandhit he
 Had it gone to the United Nations under Article 51 of the Charter, it would have been a case of illegal occupation by Pakistan on Indian land
 grih mantri ne ghati main paabandiyon ke bare main ‘dushprachaar' failaane kaa vipaksh par aarope lagaaya, unhone kaha ki pratibandh kaha hai? yah sirf aapke dimag main hai
 There are no restrictions
 sirf dushprachaar kiya ja rahaa hai
 In Kashmir, curfew has been lifted from everywhere in 196 police stations and restrictions have been imposed under Section 144 of the crpc in only eight police stations
 is dhara ke tahat paanch yaa isse zyada log ek saath ikattha nahin ho sakate hai
 He said that people are free to come anywhere in Kashmir
 shesh bharat ke kai patrkaar niyamit taur par kashmir kii yatra kar rahe hai
 Referring to the recently concluded UN General Assembly, Shah said that all world leaders have supported India's move on Article 370
 unhone kaha ki sabhi vishwa netaa (neuyark main) saat dinon ke liye jamaa hue the
 None of the leaders (of Jammu and Kashmir) raised the issue
 yah pradhanmantri kii badi kootnithik kii jeet he
 Shah said decades-old terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir has killed 41,800 people but no one raised the human rights issue of the soldiers, their widows or their orphans
 unhone kaha ki kuch dinon se mobile conection nahin chalane ko lekar log hallaa kar rahe hai
 Lack of phones does not cause human rights violations

 He said that the decision on Article 370 would strengthen India's unity and integrity
 amit shah ne kaha ki jab 1947 main bharat ko azaadi mili tab tak bharat main ‘631' desi riyaasaten thi or unamem se ‘630' riyasaton ko tatkaaleen grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne dekha tha or ek ko nehru ne
 He said that 630 princely states had merged with the Indian Union but Jammu and Kashmir remained an issue since 1947
 grih mantri ne kaha ki 27 oktober 1947 ko bhartiya sena kashmir pahunchi or pakistani hamalaavaron ko haraa diya
 The army was moving towards Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and was on the verge of winning
 unhone kaha ki achaanak se tatkaaleen sarkaar ne sangharsh viraam kii ghoshnaa kar di
 What was the need to declare a ceasefire when we were about to win the war
 agar sangharshaviram kii ghoshnaa nahin kii gai hoti thi to ab pakistan ke kabje vaala kshetra bhi bharat kaa hissaa hota
 Amit Shah said that there are a lot of rumors and propaganda about Article 370 and it is still going on
 unhone kaha ki main aapse kahana chahta hum ki anuchhed 370 kii vajah se jammu-kashmir, bharat main puri tarah se ekikrut nahin ho sakaa
 There was corruption due to Article 370
 grih mantri ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 kii vajah se log hameshaa kehete the ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 When we talk of Karnataka, West Bengal, Gujarat or Delhi, we do not have to say this
 unhone kaha ki anuchhed 370 bhootpurv jansangh kaa mudda tha or bhaajapa ke gathan ke baad yah uskaa bhi mudda rahaa he

 Farmer Vidyashankar Pandey, who met Rahul and expressed his complaint, said, "I made MP (rahul) aware of the difficulties in getting fertilizer and seeds
" unhone dhyaan se meri baaten suni or samasya ke samaadhaan kaa aashwaasan diya

 america raashtrapati is baar satark the
 He did not directly criticize the deteriorating investment climate in India, instead he was referring to the members of the American business community
 unhone khaskar retail main pratyaksh videshi nivesh par pratibandh jaisi maheen baton par aalochana kii
 But there is a very subtle difference between quoting another's point and repeating the same
 baraak obama chaahate hai ki bharat apni arthvyavastha ko khol de
 But why? Perhaps because liberalization helps in growth, it increases employment, poverty decreases, as he said in the latter part of his interview
 jaahir he, udaaravaadi arthshaastri kaa mat bhi aisa hi hota he or is baat par unase koi matbhed nahin ho saktaa ki maal, sevaaon, puunji or shram kii seemapar awajahi ho
 He would also argue that the protection benefits inefficient domestic producers and losses to consumers
 par yah daleel tab hamen sahamat kar paati jab vah aise kisi desh se aa rahi hoti jisane khud ise lagu kiya ho
 It can be said with examples that America is not ideal in terms of goods, services, capital and labor
 purv america raashtrapati ulisis grant ne kaha tha, ''sadiyon se england sangrakshan ke bharose rahaa he, is niti ko atvaad kii had tak le gaya or usase use santoshjanak laabh bhi mila
 Two centuries later, England felt that it would be more comfortable to adopt free trade because it now felt that nothing would be gained from protection
 apane desh ke bare main meri samaj kahati he ki 200 saal ke bheetar america bhi sangrakshan kii niti se baahar nikal aayega or mukt vyapaar ko apana legaa
 "years later came the smoot-hawley tariff during the war days
 aise sangrakshan kii keemat par america main dastavej bhi uplabdh hai
 It seems that Obama was telling his friend Manmohan Singh that he should learn from the mistakes made in America's past
 bhartiya pradhanmantri ne 1964 main bharat ke niryaat par jo kitaab likhi thi, uske hisaab se dekhen to unhen shaayad viksit deshon main kiye ja rahe sangrakshan kii keemat vikasshil deshon dwaara chukaaye jane ko lekar sahanubhuti thi
 Unfortunately, American mistakes on all four fronts of goods, service, capital and labor have not yet become a part of history and countless examples can be cited in its favor
 maal kii shrenee main steel or krishi, yaa phir shulkagat se gaiyr-shulkagat avarodhon kii ore badhanaa, damping nirodhak shulk, counterweling (sabsidi virdohi) shulk, niryaat sabsidi or paryaavaran ke bare main america kaa kya khyaal he? aise hi seva or puunji ke maamle main dekhen to america gharelu uddyan main epadi ke maanakon main udaarikaran par america kya kahegaa? shram ke maamle main avrajan praavdhaanon ke udaarikaran or vija ahrtaaon ko lacheela banane ko hi len
 Obama can say that he inherited all this and is trying to push back protectionism
 lekin do vajahon se yah baat pachati nahin
 First, if he looks at Obama's voting record before becoming president, he is hardly a supporter of free trade
 america sangrakshanvaad khaas taur se 2007 ke baad badha he
 In this case let go of protectionism against China (tires, solar panels, poultry, exchange rates, etc
)
 mote taur par aisi nitiyon ke tahat 2009 kaa american reconstruction and recovery act (or sambhddha praavdhaan) jinhen by america praavdhaan bhi kehete hai, niryaat sanchalit rojgaar srijan ke liye neshnal export initiative, american clin energy and security act, employament american workars act, deyari export incentive program tathaa auto kshetra ko vittiya protsaahan aadi shaamil hai
 These are just examples, the whole protectionism is more elaborate
 isi tark par kaha ja rahaa he ki bharat apane ko udaarikrut kar le, bhale hi retail main epadi aarthik sudhaaron ke samooche paridrishy kaa ek chota-sa hissaa bhar he
 Obama can argue that US policies are compatible with the World Trade Organization
 ek str par yah daleel apraasangik he
 Firstly, the classical argument of liberalization is not based on equality of any transaction
 ekatarfa udaarikaran laabh detaa he, lekin usamen vakt lagata he
 India may not adopt a liberal approach to FDI, but America needs to implement liberalization
 duusare, yadi aap dablutio kii baat karte hai, phir to samjhauton main len-dein kii baat bhi 1984 kii gat sandhi ke raste aa hi jaaegi
 If India is not getting anything in return, then why should it choose the path of liberalization? It should not be forgotten that the Doha Round talks stalled due to the insistence of developed countries (america and Europe) not to liberalize the agricultural sector
 tisare, america nitiyaan jab dablutio kaa ulanghan karti pai gayi, tab bhi america ne inhen badalane kii koi niyat nahin dikhaai
 Just hear who is saying this, "no, we will not take the path of the economy which is weakened by outsourcing
" naukariyaan or munafa samudr paar pahunchaa koi bhi america company tex kii apni javabdehi se batch nahin sakati he
 "obama said this in a 2012 State of the Union address
 unhone kaha tha, ''main america utpaadon ke liye bazaar dhundne duniya main kahin bhi ja saktaa hum
 "yes, don't imply that America will also open its markets for foreign goods
" isi ko kehete hai par upadesh kushal bahuterey

 3 sitambar ko vipareet disha main jayega vikram lander4 sitambar ko sabase najdiki kaksha main rahegaa vikram7 sitambar ko karegaa chand kii sataha par soft landingbhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ke vaigyanik aaj yani 2 sitambar ko dopaher 12
 45 to 1
 45 baje ke bich chandrayan-2 yaan ke orbitor se vikram lander ko alag kar degaa
 After this, for about 20 hours, Vikram Lander will follow his father ie orbiter at a speed of 2 km per second
 iske baad yah vipareet disha main chand kaa chakkar lagaana shuru karegaa
 Chandrayaan-2 is made up of three parts - first- orbiter, second- Vikram Lander and third- Pragyan Rover
 vikram lander ke andar hi pragyan rover he, jo soft landing ke baad baahar nikalegaa
 After this, what will Vikram Lander do for the next five days
 
 
 aaie jaanate hai vikram ke kaam ke bare main
 
 
 On September 3, the first deorbit, ie, Vikram Lander, will change the class in the opposite direction on September 3 at 9 am
 00 se 10
 Between 00 o'clock, Vikram Lander will leave the chase of Chandrayaan-2's Orbiter and go to the new class
 tab yah 109 kimi kii apoji or 120 kimi kii periji main chand kaa chakkar lagayegaa
 It is called deorbit in scientific language, that is, moving in the opposite direction to the direction in which it was going
 orbitor se alag hone ke baad vikram lander 2 kimi prati second kii gati se hi chand ke chaaron taraf orbitor ke vipareet disha main chakkar lagayegaa
 This has been done because the orbiter will revolve around the moon at a distance of 100 km
 lekin, chand ke dakshini dhruv par jane ke liye vikram lander ko apni disha badalani hogi
 Therefore, he will have to go round the moon in the opposite direction
 4 sitambar ko chand ke chaaron taraf vikram duusari baar badalegaa apni kakshaisero vaigyanik vikram lander ko 4 sitambar kii dopaher 3 se 4 baje ke bich chand ke sabase najdiki kaksha main pahunchaayenge
 The Apogee of this class will be 36 km and Periji 110 km
 5 or 6 sitambar ko lagaataar hogi vikram lander ke sehat kii jaanch4 sitambar ko duusari baar chand kii kaksha badalane yani chand ke sabase najdiki kaksha main pahunchane ke baad 6 sitambar tak vikram lander ke sabhi sensors or pelods ke sehat kii jaanch hogi

 40 o'clock at night (intermittent night of 6 and 7 September) - Vikram Lander will start descending to the south pole of the moon from a height of 35 km
 tab isaki gati hogi 200 meter prati second
 This will be a very challenging task for ISRO scientists
 1:55 baje raat -vikram lander dakshini dhruv par maujuud do cretar mengines-si or simpelius-en ke bich maujuud maidan main utrega
 From a height of about 6 km, the lander will land on the lunar surface at a speed of 2 meters per second
 ye 15 minute behad tanaavpurn honge
 3
 55 baje raat -landing ke kareeb 2 ghante ke baad vikram lander kaa ramp khulegaa
 Through this, the 6-wheeled Pragyan Rover will land on the moon's surface
 5
 At 05 am - Solar Rover Solar panel will open
 isi solar panel ke jariye vah urja hasil karegaa
 5
 10 baje subah -pragyan rover chand kii sataha par chalanaa shuru karegaa
 He will travel for 14 days on the lunar surface at a speed of one centimeter per second
 is dauraan vah 500 meter kii duuri tay karegaa
 Orbiter: isro's mobile command center 100 km above the moon, the orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 will send the information received from the lander and rover to ISRO center, orbiting 100 km above the moon
 isamen 8 pelod hai
 Also, the command sent from ISRO to the lander and rover
 ise hindustan aironautics limited ne banaakar 2015 main hi isro ko saunp diya tha
 Vikram Lander: ISRO built indigenous Landerlander on Russia's refusal, named after ISRO founder and father of Indian space program Vikram Sarabhai
 isamen 4 pelod hai
 It will carry out scientific experiments for 15 days
 isaki shuruaati dizin isro ke spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ne banaaya tha
 Later it was developed by the URSC of Bengaluru
 pragyan roverh is robot ke kandhe par puraa mishan, 15 minute main milegaa data27 kilo ke is robot par hi puure mishan kii jimmdari he
 It has 2 payloads
 chand kii sataha par yah kareeb 400 meter kii duuri tay karegaa
 During this time it will conduct various scientific experiments
 phir chand se praapt jaankaree ko vikram lander par bhejega
 The lander will send data to the orbiter from there
 phir orbitor use isro centre par bhejega
 This entire process will take about 15 minutes
 yani pragyan se bheji gai jaankaree dharti tak aane main 15 minute lagenge
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has reminded of the martyrdom of his grandmother Indira and father Rajiv Gandhi for the country, expressing apprehension that Aman's enemies will one day also kill him (rahul)
 rajasthan ke churu main ek chunavi raily ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne yah andeshaa jaahir kiya
 Rahul attacked those who tried to spoil the communal atmosphere within the country in a very sharp but emotional manner
 rahul gandhi ne bijepi par qaraar prahaar karte hue aarope lagaaya ki vah aisi party he, jo vot ke liye hindu-musalmaan ko aapas main ladaati he
 At the rally in Churu, Rahul Gandhi said that today one brother is being fought with another brother
 bijepi raajnneetik laabh ke liye do sampradaay ke logon ko ladaa rahi he
 He said that riots were conducted in Muzaffarnagar in UP for political gains only
 unhone talkh tevar main kaha ki aisi raajnneeti se samaaj or desh kaa baari nuksaan hota he
 In other words, Rahul Gandhi revealed that Satwant Singh and Beant Singh wanted to kill his grandmother Indira Gandhi by throwing a grenade on the day of Diwali
 rahul ne kaha ki bachapan main satvant singh or beant singh se unki acchhee dosti thi
 They had faith in these people, which they broke
 'isliye bijepi kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf hum'unhone kaha, ‘koi bhi gussa ho saktaa he
 Anger is intentionally filled with people

 Beant and Satwant Singh were bodyguards of his grandmother Indira Gandhi
 vahaan baithe sikhon kii taraf ishaara karte hue gandhi ne kaha ki us vakt punjab ke log gusse main the lekin ab vah gussa kam ho gaya he
 'anger arises from hunger', he said, 'A few months ago a Punjab MLA came to me
 baatcheet chal rahi thi
 Before leaving he told me that if he had met me 20 years ago, he would have killed me
 usne kaha ki vah us vakt gusse se bharaa tha lekin ab vah mujhe gale laga saktaa he
 He said, "it takes years to calm that anger but it takes one minute to provoke it
" us gusse ko hataane or bhraatrutiv paidaa karne main kaaphi vakt lagata he
 Linking the anger of a section of the people to the larger theme of anger due to lack of communal violence in the society, the Congress vice-president said that anger not only arises from killing people but also from hunger

 gandhi ne kaha, ‘hamen agle 10 varshon main ek cheez or badalani he or ise hamen yuvaaon ke saath karnaa he
 The biggest drawback of our country is in the political system
 chaahe yah bhaajapa ho yaa congress, basapa ho yaa sapa
 Only 300 to 400 people are running this system
 main chahta hum ki aane vaale varshon main vyavastha ko lakhon yuva chalaaen
 'rahul Gandhi said,' Rajiv Gandhi had abolished the quota in the (landline) telephone and you all got a mobile phone in your hand
 main raajnneetik vyavastha main is kotawad ko khatm karnaa chahta hum or jaise mobile phone aapke haath main he usee tarah bhavishya main rajnatik shakti aapke haath main hogi
 Talking about political changes in the country after 2014, he said that once the Congress party starts it, other parties will also follow it as they do in other aspects
 rajasthan ke logon ko videsh main bhi milegaa rojgaraunhone kaha, ‘saal 2014 ke liye ladaai chal rahi he
 My job is not to win elections but also to tell you about far-reaching thinking for the future
 ’ unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye kadamon ke kaaran rajasthan ke yuvakon ko na sirf bharat main balki aanevaale samay main videsh main bhi rojgaar milegaa
 Gandhi said that Congress is doing politics of rights

 Gandhi said, 'when a woman watches television she sees the rich in airplanes, big boats and cars and on the other hand their children are hungry and sitting idle at home
 ve poochhate hai ki unka kya hoga
 When will they board an airplane and a ship? ’ unhone kaha, ‘duusari taraf yuvaaon kaa apana dard he
 We want to bring the poor, the rich and all communities and people belonging to all religions together
 ham yah nahin kah rahe hai ki sirf garib bharat main rahete hai
 The country cannot progress without trade and industry
 ham chaahate hai ki garibon or amiron ke bich bhagidaari ho
 Gandhi said that works like laying new railway lines and setting up freight corridors would open up new avenues in manufacturing for the youth in the country
 raily main mahilaon or yuvaaon se samvaad karte hue congress upaadhyaksh ne unase kaha ki unki party ne unka dard or gussa kam karne kaa prayaas kiya he or karodon berozegaron ke liye rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karne ke liye kadam uthaati he

 It hurts the country
 log iske kaaran marate hai or yah gussa paidaa karata he
 i have seen it not once but twice

 "in addition, yoga and some light exercises can help you avoid it," he says
 thyroid hone ke baad bhi kuch yogasana aise hai jo iske straav ke str ko niyantrit karne main madad karte hai

 :) shivasena or bhaajapa ke bich vakyuddh us vakt or tej ho gaya jab bhaajapa ke ek prakaashan ne apane lekh main ek bhaajapa netaa ne uddhav thakare kii party ko ‘talaak’ lene kii chunauti de di
 bjp's Maharashtra unit publication 'manogat' has written an article by the party's Maharashtra spokesperson Madhav Bhandari titled 'when are you getting divorced, Mr
 Raut'
 lekh main shivasena ko gathbandhan se alag hone kii chunauti di gai he tathaa donon partiyon ke kai varsh puraane gathbandhan main bhaajapa kii ore se kiye gaye tyaag kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Significantly, he has been targeted in this article regarding the statement of 'nizam' of Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut
 lekh main kaha gaya, 'ek taraf ve usee ‘nizaam’ ke die plate main ‘biryani’ khate hai or duusari taraf hamaari aalochana karte hai
 He has got ministries at the Center and in the state, is enjoying the power of power with the help of the same 'nizam' and then calls the BJP bad
 ise kritaghnata kehete hai
 'this article in the publication of BJP says,' If they feel so victimized by the 'nizam' then why not go out
 parantu ve saahas nahin dikhaate
 Raut recently said that bjp-led governments at the Center and in Maharashtra are worse than the Nizam's government
 bhandari ne kaha, 've hamaare saath baithte he, hamaare saath khate hai or phir ham par hamale bhi karte hai
 
 behatar hoga ki 'nizaam' ke pita se talaak le liya jaae
 So Mr
 Raut, when are you getting divorced? ' Criticizing Raut's alleged partisan approach, the article said that Raut feels that the present government has done a lot of injustice and he does not even see a lot of work done in Maharashtra through 'jal Shivar'
 chunaavon main bhaajapa ke behatar pradarshan kaa zikr karte hue lekh main kaha gaya, '1995 main bhaajapa ne 117 siton par chunaav ladaa or 65 jiti
 The BJP won more seats than the Shiv Sena despite contesting fewer seats in 2009
 ' Bhandari said, 'sanjay Raut and the Shiv Sena party chief are unable to digest the fact that their strength is decreasing and that is why they are upset
 unako badalte raajnneetik halaat ko sweekaar karnaa chahie or hamen jimmedaar tehraana band karnaa chahie
 'his article said,' We left Shiv Sena behind in Aurangabad and kalyan-dombivali elections
 matadaata bhaajapa ko majboot vikalp ke taur par maan rahe hai or yahi shivasena ko sabase zyada chubh rahaa he
 This article of the BJP publication further stated that the BJP made many sacrifices like it had left areas like Pune, Thane and Guhagarh in the past for the Shiv Sena when the BJP won the elections from these places
 apane lekh kaa bachaav karte hue bhandari ne kaha, 'pehle ham aisi chizon ko nazarandaaj kar diya karte the lekin ab unhone vinamrata kii sari simaaen laangh di hai
 This was discussed in our recent state conference
 ab ham unako sidhe taur par bataanaa chaahate hai ki agar unhen thik nahin lagata to ve apana khud kaa rasta talash len

 gauratlab he ki shivasena ke saansad sanjay raut ke 'nizaam' vaale bayaan ko lekar is lekh main un par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he
 The article said, 'on one side they eat' Biryani 'in the given plate of the same' Nizam 'and on the other side criticize us

 But they do not show courage
 ' raut ne haal hi main kaha tha ki centre or maharashtra main bhaajapa nit sarkarein nizaam kii sarkaar se bhi badtar hai

 The result of a prolonged legal battle with the declaration of their assets by the principal judge and other judges, as well as petitions related to the right to information, has calmed the controversy in which information was sought about the assets of the judges of the Supreme Court, regarding which a long legal battle was fought in the Delhi High Court

 There has been a flood of messages on Facebook news feed in which people are saying about each other
 chunki bhejne vaale kii pahchaan jaahir nahin hoti, isliye koi bhi kuch kah rahaa he
 But there are many potential dangers of using this app
 kuch basic baaten is website or ap ke bare main jo aapako janani chahie
 It is built by Zainul Abedin, a developer in Saudi Arabia
 lekin is domen ko register america main kiya gaya he
 According to the website details, the person who has registered it is also from America
 lekin abhi is par shansay barkaraar he or yah domen par bhi nirbhar karata he
 However, this question definitely raises the authenticity of this website
 is website ko denwar kolrado ke ek company ne register kiya he
 This is a web hosting company like Go Daddy
 - develpar agar chaahe to wo aapaki ditels share kar saktaa he
 Because this app is not of any company that you can trust
 - isamen register karne ke liye aapako apni email idi deni hoti he
 Hackers can trace you through email ID, IP address and browser cookies
 - is ap main likhaa he ki aane vaale samay main koi or fitures aa sakate hai
 - Hackers can hack it and demand ransom from users
 phiroti isliye, kyonki yugers kisiko bhi massej bhej rahe hai inamen apane dost hai or wo bhadaas nikaal rahe hai
 If there is talk of identification, then surely they will have trouble
 isliye havers ke liye bhi yah soft torget kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 - Your information can be sold on the dark web
 havers yaa is website kaa develpar aapaki jaankariyon ko dark web bech kar mote paise kama saktaa he
 Your email ID and meta data can be sold to an advertising company
 itnaa hi nahin havers aapke pattern ko trek karke iske jariye aapke duusare acount main bhi send lagane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 - It is also possible that as the next feature, the developer will launch a feature that identifies
 - philhal riplai karne kaa opshan nahin he is ap main, lekin aane vaale samay main isamen ye opshan aid kiya ja saktaa he
 What is this app and how does it work
 sabase pehle isaki website yaa ap par yujar ko registration karnaa hota he
 Email ID has to be given for this
 register karne ke baad iskaa link fasebuk par post karne kaa opshan miltaa he
 Apart from Facebook, it has the option to post on other social networks such as Twitter and Snapchat
 is link ko public kar sakate hai yaa privet massej ke jariye kisi ko bhej sakate hai
 Anyone can send you a message by clicking this link
 lekin bheje gaye shaks kaa naam aapako nahin dikhegaa
 That is, anyone can write whatever they want to you
 ap store yaa play store se is ap ko downlod kiya ja saktaa he 
 As soon as someone sends you a message through the link, you will get a notification in your app and you can read the message here
 saraahah ap main di gai jaankaree ke mutabik ise apane saath kaam karne vaale yaa apane doston se imaanadaar feedback le paa sakate hai
 However, messages received through it cannot be republished
 dilli hoicourt ne tees hazari court main police or vakeelon ke bich hui hinsa kii nyaayik jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 There are many videos related to this incident
 vakeelon or javaanon kii taraf se kai tarah ke daawey hai
 There are many kinds of things
 lekin in sabake bich ek sawaal gum ho gaya he
 Was there sexual violence with a senior IPS officer? molest kiya gaya tha
 Is his pistol missing? If there is a missing case, has a case been filed for this, why did not the female IPS officer file a lawsuit, even when the incident happened with her in the court premises
 mahila ipies vardi main thim
 Delhi Police personnel say that no media comes forward for them because even after the video of a young man being beaten, the commissioner did not speak
 mangalvaar ko javaanon kii media se yah shikaayat dur ho gai hogi
 But did the situation of the soldiers improve with this? Their demand was for the union which was not fulfilled
 saket court ke baahar jis vakil ne consteble karan ko maaraa uske khilaaf karrwai kii baat baar council ke adhyaksh manan kumaar mishra bhi kar rahe hai lekin kya exiaar se aage karrwai hogi? yah nyaay tantra kaa test cese hoga
 However, the family and well-wishers of Ghaziabad police took out a candle march in the evening
 yah kyon ho rahaa he, is par sochane se kai jawaab milenge
 UP soldiers are facing torture in their jobs
 unki selary kam he
 Do not leave for weeks
 maheenon chuttee nahin milti he
 Get a posting away from home
 kam tankhwaah main unhen do-do jagahon par ghar kaa kharch uthaanaa padataa he
 Is this soldier not excesses with people? yahi haal madhya pradesh kaa he
 The soldiers there also protested with the demand for increment
 kabhi sipaahiyon ke barrack main jaakar halaat dekhie
 Seems like they need help
 agar kaam karne kii sthiti behatar nahin hogi, kaam kaa sammaan nahin hoga to ham police se behatari kii ummid hi karte rah jaaenge, hoga kuch nahin
 Therefore, lawyers should not complain in front of the soldiers
 kaabil vakil tivi ke dibet se lekar mantri pad par sushobhit hai
 The entire political party follows them
 kisi sipaahi ko rajyasabha nahin milti he
 Lawyers get Rajya Sabha
 iske baad bhi zilon main vakeelon ke kaam karne kii jagah main sudhaar kii bahut zarurat he
 They work in the sun
 barish main bhig kar kaam karte hai
 This is the reason for the confrontation between lawyers and police in many districts
 kahin parking nahin he
 There is no proper seating arrangement
 jab tak vakeelon ke kaam karne kii jagah behatar nahin hogi tab tak aise takaraav samay samay par hote hi rahenge
 On Tuesday, the performance of the Delhi Police personnel was presented as a lawyer versus the police, but if you look properly, the performance of the soldiers was against their department and officers who neither went to see the soldiers in the hospital nor did any tweet for them
 yah hataasha uski thi
 Surely lawyers can also say that Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad did not even tweet for them
 ho saktaa he is vajah se bhi vakeelon ko akelaapan mahasoos ho rahaa ho
 Rather, lawyers should demand that the media show their place of work, how hard they are working under conditions and they are also working for justice
 magar is puure maamle ko kisi bhi peshey kii chhaviyon se jodna thik nahin he
 In 2016, journalists were also attacked by some lawyers in Patiala Court
 patrakaron ne kabhi nahin kaha ki saare vakil kharaab hai
 On the other hand, the incident did not affect the lawyers' image
 aage chal kar donon hi paksh is baat ko bhul gaye
 If the images were concerned, the lawyers would come forward and fight for the journalists
 is hamale main kanhaiya kumaar kii jaan par ban ai thi
 Kanhaiya Kumar Kumar's tweet should be seen in this entire matter
 jisase saaf hota he ki is ghatana ke baad bhi na to vakeelon kii chhavi kharaab hui he or na police kii
 Whether the image is good or bad, who knows better than lawyers that the decision in court is based on the facts
 chhaviyon ke aadhaar par nahin
 The movement of the soldiers was one-day, but the movement of the lawyers has been going on for many days
 somvaar se lekar buudhvaar tak dilli kii zila adaalaton main kaam nahin hua
 Lawyer Karnail Singh says that the policemen who shot him should be arrested
 baar council of india ne kaha ki vakil hadtaal khatm karen or kaam par jaaen
 The Bar Council of India had said that they would ask for the names of the lawyers who killed the policeman outside Saket Court
 kya wo naam un tak pahunch gaya he, vahi bataa sakate hai
 All the District Sessions Courts in Delhi have been directed that the court officials will not share any kind of video clip, text message or picture on social media or anyone in the Tis Hazari case
 dilli hoicourt main is masale par sunwaayee hui
 In this hearing, lawyers also reached on behalf of Delhi Police
 ye acchhee baat rahi
 Delhi Police has more than 250 panels on its panel
 ye sambandh bana rahe magar iske liye zaruri he ki tees hazari maamle main jaanch nishpakshta se ho, jaldi ho or faisla bhi jaldi aae
 The debate in the Supreme Court about pollution shows that no government is doing its job in this matter
 justise arun mishra or justise deepak gupta ke sawaalon ke saamne chaar-chaar mukhya sachivon kii haalat aisi ho gai thi jaise apana home work copy ghar bhul aae hon or pet dard kaa bahaanaa bana rahe hon
 The court today favored the farmers
 saaf kar diya ki paraali kii samasya kisaanon kii nahin, rajya kii zimmedaari he
 Funds cannot be accepted by the government
 kisaanon ko sazaa dena koi samaadhaan nahin he
 It is necessary to provide them basic facilities and resources
 unki madad kii bajaae kanoonee karrwai kii aalochana kii or kaha ki isse kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi
 The poor farmer will be forced to commit suicide
 mukhya sachivon se kaha ki aapako kisaanon kii madad kerani hogi
 The court has ordered that small and marginal farmers should be given assistance of Rs 100 per acre within 7 days so that they do not burn stubble
 punjab haryana or upi ke kisaanon ke liye yah aadesh he
 How much the center will share in this will be decided later
 court ne yah bhi kaha he ki teen maheene ke andar chote or seemaant kisaanon kii hiton kii raksha ke liye centre vyapak yojana banaae jise puure desh main lagu hoga
 He told the monitoring committee that he should see that these court orders are not followed
 dilli ke mukhya sachiv vijay kumaar dev, haryana ke mukhya sachiv ke ek aroda, punjab ke mukhya sachiv karan avatar singh or upi ke mukhya sachiv rajendra kumaar tiwari aaj kaa din shaayad hi kabhi bhul saken
 It is expected that this strictness of the court will take some concrete initiative in this matter
 ham ek-ek kar bataaenge ki kis mukhya sachiv kii baari ai to phir kya hua
 The Chief Secretary of Punjab, Karan Avtar Singh, was called forward by the Bench
 poocha ki aap yah bataaiye ki puure saal kya kiya
 It is known that stubble is about to burn, so why not prepare beforehand
 punjab ke mukhya sachiv ne fund kii kami kii baat kii to court or naaraaz ho gaya
 Said that you are a state government
 aap centre sarkaar ke bharose kyon rahete hai
 If you do not have funds, do not have plans, then you have no right to be the Chief Secretary
 garib kisaanon par karrwai se kuch nahin hoga
 They have to provide basic facilities
 yahi nahin punjab ke mukhya sachiv se adaalat ne kaha ki kyon na ham aapako yaheen se suspend kar bhej den
 On behalf of the central government, Attorney General KK Venugopal has said that 44 percent of the fog over Delhi's sky comes from stubble
 lekin do lakh kisaanon ko paraali jalaane se nahin roka ja saktaa he
 Their livelihood will be affected
 tab court ne poocha ki jab haryana roak saktaa he to punjab kyon nahin
 Then Haryana Chief Secretary Key Arora might have thought that his number would not come but it did not
 jab haryana ke mukhya sachiv ne kaha ki hamane choti or lambii avadhi kii yojana banaai to unhen bhi fatkaar pad gai
 The court said that this is not the way
 chote kisaanon ko mashine nahin mil rahi hai
 Haryana's Chief Secretary said that we have given machines to one and a half hundred people, who are giving them to farmers at low rent
 court ne poocha ki kya aapane zameendaari pratha kii tarah bichauliye niyukt kar die hai
 The court asked how much these people take from the farmer
 vakil ne kaha ki prati acre chah sau rupee lete hai, tab adaalat ne kaha ki kisaan itnaa paisa kahaan se degaa
 The court was sensitive to farmers
 jajon ke sawaal se saaf tha ki unki nazar main yah baat spasht thi ki kisaan akele is samasya ko nahin taal saktaa he
 Nor can it be avoided by holding farmers responsible
 sarkaar ko hi zimmedaari leni hogi
 The court said that now the time has come to make aware, the time has come to take action
 is bich upi ke mukhya sachiv apana naam bataane lage to adaalat ne kaha ki hamen aapke naam main nahin, kaam main dilchaspee he
 He said that one per cent stubble burns in UP compared to Punjab, then the court said that you cannot do such a comparison
 kisaanon ke khilaaf karrwai se bachein
 Help them dilli ke mukhyaschiv vijay kumaar dev se poocha ki aap dilli ke mukhya sachiv kii kursi par kyon hai
 Is this the capital? puri dilli main dhul dikhaai detii he
 You should be held responsible
 nigamon ke bharose kuch nahin choda ja saktaa
 There is corruption in corporations
 court ne kaha ki dilli main 13 hot spot chune gaye hai
 Things should improve in seven days
 mukhya sachiv ne kaha ki ham saat dinon main kadam uthaaenge
 Will apply environment marshal
 is par court ne kaha ki dilli main sadaken kagaz par ban rahi hai
 What happened to the smart city? karodon rupee vishwa bank se milte hai, sara paisa kaha jaataa he
 Pits are to be filled in a week, a status report has to be filed
 court ne kaha ki dilli ko sirf monitering cameti hi bachaa rahi he
 Everyone else is targeting him
 vaahanon kaa pradooshan kam he magar nirmaan kaary kooda jalaane or sadakon kii dhul par ankush nahin he

Is the volcano erupting rebellion against AAP convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal due to defeats in Punjab and Goa and then MCD? If you look at the events of the last two-three days and the statements of party leaders, the answer to both these questions can be yes
 arvind kejariwal ne kal media main jari atakalon ko khaarij karne ke liye twit kiya tha ki kumaar vishwaas unke chote bhai hai or un donon ko koi alag nahin kar saktaa
 But this matter has increased rather than being calm with Kejriwal's tweet because till now the reports of not getting everything right between Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwas were based on mere speculation, this tweet has been stamped in a way
 punjab-goa or dilli main haar se kamjor pade kejarivalpunjab vidhansabha chunaavon main aam aadmi party ko satta kaa daavedaar bataaya ja rahaa tha
 He was expected to do well in Goa, but in the results of the assembly elections, the party got cleaned up in Goa while only 20 mlas were able to win in Punjab
 jaise ki yahi kaaphi nahin tha
 In the Rajouri Garden by-election, the party candidate's bail was forfeited, while in the MCD election, the party got worse and even in the three mcds, it could not touch the figure of 50 councilors
 haar ke baad kejariwal ne janata se bhale hi maafee maang lee ho lekin unki khud kii party ke netaa unhen bakhshane ke mood main nahin hai
 Kumar is confident that Kejriwal's alternative is being told that many Aam Aadmi Party leaders are not in the mood to let Kejriwal rule the party and the government
 lagaataar haar ke baad ab aawaaj uth rahi hai ki party or sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke liye alag-alag chehron ko aage kiya jaae
 This is somewhat like a person-a-post demand, but Kejriwal is on target
 bataaya jaataa he kiparty ke kai netaa chaahate hai ki kejarivaldilli kii sarkaar chalaaen jabaki party chalaane kaa jimmaa kisi duusare netaa ko diya jaae
 The name of Kumar Vishwas is at the forefront of the role of the second leader
 kapil mishra ne kiya bade badlaav kaa daawadilli sarkaar main cabinet mantri kapil mishra ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki jo baar-baar haar ke liye zimmedaar rahe hai unhen ghar main baithna chahie
 Kapil supported the video of Kumar Vishwas saying that Kumar has given a platform to the voice of the activists
 unhone aam aadmi party main bade badlaav kaa ishaara karte hue saaf kaha ki himalay se ganga nikalne vaali he, aam aadmi party main bada badlaav, bada parivartan hone vaala he ye sunishchat he
 Kapil also said that those who lost due should now rest
 sabhi vidhayakon kii yahi maang he
 Kapil said the change was sure but did not say what kind of change would happen
 haalanki unke bayanon main itnaa to saaf ho hi gaya ki wo kumaar vishwaas kii party main ahm bhoomika or 'vartmaan' leadership ko ghar baitaane ke pakshdhar hai
 In response to Kapil, Amarkatullah of Amanatullah openly supported Kumar Vishwas and another AAP MLA Amanatullah came from the opposing camp
 unhone to kumaar vishwaas ko bijepi kaa agent tak qaraar diya or kaha ki wo party main kejariwal ko hataakar khud sanyojak bananaa chaahate hai
 However, as soon as Amanatullah's statement came to light, Kejriwal tweeted Kumar Vishwas as a younger brother, but the party has now reached the point where it does not seem easy to back him
 kejariwal banaam kumara aap ho gai he do faadaaj sthiti ye he ki aam aadmi party ke tamaam netaa kejariwal or kumaar vishwaas ke paksh main lamband hote ja rahe hai
 Delhi MLA Alka Lamba has demanded action against Amanatullah for making a statement against Kumar Vishwas
 vahiin punjab ke bhi sabhi aap vidhayak kumaar vishwaas ke samarthan main aa gaye hai or unhonekejariwal ko chitthee likhakar amanatullake khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 Kejriwal may be describing Kumar Vishwas as his younger brother but it is also true that despite being the most popular and crowd-gathering leader after Kejriwal in the party, Kumar Vishwas did not get the importance he deserved
 amethi main bhi akele pad gaye the kumaar vishwasaloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan amethi main kumaar vishwaas to varanasi main arvind kejariwal maidan main the
 All the small big leaders of AAP reached Varanasi to campaign for Kejriwal but they kept distance from Amethi and left Kumar Vishwas alone
 haalat ye ho gai ki kumaar vishwaas ko khulkar iske prati naaraazgi jataani padi tab kejariwal amethi prachaar karne pahunche
 Vishwas himself taunted in an interview after the election that Amethi did not have ghats and hotels to visit like Banaras, perhaps no leader arrived there

 'mahabuuba mufti ko yah notice ravivaar ko mila he
 On the other hand, the PDP has expressed its displeasure over this notice and said that they are being targeted for opposing the policies of the Center
 mahabuuba mufti kaa bhi kahana he ki un par dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he or jaanboojh kar bhrashtachar ke aarope madhe ja rahe hai
 According to reports, other ministers of the Jammu and Kashmir government in the past can also be served a notice in this regard
 apane pichley 20 saal se adhik samay ke karier main test or ekadivasiy maichon main sarvaadhik ran or sarvaadhik shatak sahit kai ricard banane vaale sachin tendulkar test or pratham shrenee maichon main ab bhi ballebaaji ke kai ricard nahin chhu paye hai or inamen se to kuch unki pahunch se lagbhag baahar hai
 Tendulkar made history by scoring a 50th Test century against South Africa at Centurion on Sunday
 vah duniya ke pehle ballebaaj hai jinhone shatakon kaa ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Now he is only four hundred away from completing 100 centuries in international cricket
 is mahaan ballebaaj ke naam par ricardon kii lambii fehrist darj he lekin bryan lara kii test or pratham shrenee cricket main sarvocch vyaktigat pari, jaik habs ke pratham shrenee maichon main sarvaadhik shatak or ran, ek test, ek shrinkhalaa, ek din, ek calendar varsh main sarvaadhik ran aadi kuch aise ricard hai jo ricardon ke badshaah ke naam par darj nahin hai
 Lara has scored an unbeaten 400 in Test matches and an unbeaten 501 in first-class matches which are world records
 iske vipareet tendulkar aaj tak pratham shrenee cricket main bhi tihara shatak nahin laga paye hai
 His highest score is 248 not out, which he scored against Bangladesh
 england ke habs ne jahaan pratham shrenee maichon main 199 shatak or 61 hajaar se adhik ran banaaye hai vahiin tendulkar is ricard main unase milon peeche hai
 Only 77 centuries and more than 23 thousand runs are recorded in his name
 kisi ek test shrinkhalaa main sarvaadhik ran don breadman (974 ran) ne banaaye hai jabaki bharat kii taraf se gavaskar (774) isamen sheersh par hai
 Tendulkar is yet to reach 500 runs in any series
 ek din main sarvaadhik ran bhi breadman (309) ne banaaye hai jabaki tendulkar kabhi ek din main 200 ran nahin bana paye hai
 Although the record for the most Test runs in a calendar year is visible in Tendulkar's JD this time, but for this he will have to score 246 runs in the second Test match which starts in Durban from 26 December
 pakistan ke mohammad yusuf ne 2006 main 1788 ran banaaye the jabaki tendulkar is saal abhi tak 1543 ran bana chuke hai
 Yusuf also holds the record for the most nine centuries in a calendar year, while Tendulkar has so far this year equaled Ricky Ponting, Viv Richards and Arvind desilva with seven centuries
 yahi nahin tendulkar test maichon main adam gilcrist ke 100 chhakkon se kaaphi peeche hai
 The master blaster has so far hit 62 sixes in a record 175 Tests
 haalanki sarvaadhik chauke (1871 se adhik) kaa ricard tendulkar ke naam par he
 Tendulkar is yet to score 1000 runs on any one ground
 kisi ek maidan par sarvaadhik ran banane kaa ricard srilanka ke mahela jayavardhane ke naam par he
 From India only Gavaskar and VVS Laxman have achieved this feat
 tendulkar pichley 20 saal se antarrashtriya cricket khel rahe hai lekin sabase lambey karier kaa ricard bhi unke boote se baahar dikh rahaa he
 If Tendulkar continues to play for the next ten years, then only this record will be able to be named after him, because England's Wilfred Rhodes international career was drawn for 30 years 315 days
 pichley saal agast main sir main chot lagane ke baad se coma main chal rahe purv kendriya mantrijaswant sinhako mangalvaar raat ko dilli ke army research and refral aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya he
 Singh was brought here after fever symptoms and respiratory problems
 aspataal ke ek senior doctor ne kaha ki sir main gambhir chotein lagane ke baad se vah coma main hai
 Recently, he developed symptoms of fever and respiratory disorders, after which his family brought him to the hospital
 unhone kaha ki vah isiu main hai or unhen saans lene main madad ke liye ventilator par rakhaa gaya he
 But his position is stable and soon he will be out of ICU

 The mountainous river Kanher is on the upsurge

 People leaving their homes and coming to the city crossing the river to save lives from disease
 sabase zyada bura haal bhauti gaanv kaa he
 People are also vulnerable to disease here
 aise main inke parijan bimaaron ko khatiyon main litaakar apane kandhe ke sahare nadi paar karke laa rahe hai
 The floods are more affected in Jabera, Salivada, Gogra and Sela villages
 afsos kii baat yah he ki sarkari amala abhi tak inaki sahaayta karne nahin pahunchaa he
 The government makes big claims about flood management preparations, but what is the reality of these claims is in front of everyone
 gaanv ke logon kaa kahana he ki logon ko gardanabar pani se hokar nikalnaa padataa he
 Children are unable to go to school for a month
 yadi koi biimaar pad jaae, to use charpai main ladakar nadi paar kerani padati he

 Both women and men have received bullets
 ye sab sonbhadra jile ke narsanhaar main dekhne ko mila he
 In Sonbhadra, Uttar Pradesh, 10 people were killed in a ground dispute on Wednesday
 sonbhadra cond aisa cond he, jo sidhe-sidhe uttar pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha ko khuli chunauti de rahaa he
 In Sonbhadra, the fearless bullets rammed bullets to the ground in broad daylight
 32 tractaron par savaar hokar 300 log gaanv main ghuse or laashen bicha deen
 The gangs of Sonbhadra created panic in the whole of Uttar Pradesh
 upi main hue is khun kharabe ne puure pradesh ko hilaakar rakh diya he
 Questions arise as to why the bullets fired in Sonbhadra? Why dozens of people were bled? How, when and why did all this happen? What was the police doing? What was the Yogi government doing? Currently, cases have been registered against 11 nominated and 50 unidentified people, including the village head, in this Sonbhadra massacre
 narsanhaar main istemaal kiye gaye hathiyaaron ko police ne baraamad kar liya he
 Although the village headman who fired bullets is still absconding, 24 people have been arrested, including the nephew of the village headman
 kya he maamla?darasal, buudhvaar ko sonbhadra ke ghorawal thana kshetra ke murtiya gaanv main jameen kabjane ko lekar firing hui thi
 There are hundreds of bigha fields on the outskirts of the village, on which some people of the village have been doing ancestral farming
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik is jameen kaa ek bada hissaa pradhan ke naam par he
 The village head Yajnadatta bought 100 bighas of land from an IAS officer
 yajyadutt ne is jameen par kabje ke liye badi sankhya main apane saathiyon ke saath pahunchakar tractaron se jameen jotane kii koshish kii
 Local villagers opposed it
 iske baad gram pradhan paksh ke logon ne gaanv waalon par tabadatod goliyaan chalaa deen

 In this case, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi made a tweet circling CM Yogi Adityanath
 jisamen unhone kaha, 'bhaajapa-raaj main aparaadhiyon ke hausale itane bad gaye hai ki din-dahaade hatyaon kaa daur jari he
 On the other hand, CM Yogi has announced assistance of Rs five lakh to the family of those killed in the Sonbhadra incident
 saath hi jiladhikari sonbhadra ko nirdesh die hai ki wo bataaen ki gaanv waalon ko patte aakhir kyon muhaiyaa nahin karaae gaye the

 At a political rally, Shiv Sena working president Uddhav Thackeray's speech did not falter in abusing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ab mumbai ke city colector ne uddhav kii raily main pradhanmantri par die apmanjanak bayaan kii jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Surprisingly, BJP national president Rajnath Singh was also present at the time when Uddhav Thackeray was thrashing democracy from the stage
 lekin janatantr ke daaman par kichad oochhaalane kaa ye silsilaa yaheen nahin rukaa
 When the turn came from BJP state president Nitin Gadkari, he too used the same pornographic dictionary to accentuate his speech, through which Uddhav had sharpened his speech a while back

 As such, Feig has previously made female-centric films such as Spy, The Heat and Bridesmaid, and has maintained the same in Ghostbusters

 However the script is a bit weak
 lekin aapako film kaa majaa lenaa he to isko 1984 kii original film ke saath jodakar to katai mat dekhiegaa
