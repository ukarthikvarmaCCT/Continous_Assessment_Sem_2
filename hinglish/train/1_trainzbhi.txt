 haalanki, ise paariwarik darshakon ke saamne parosane ke liye unhen sensor board se maheenon jaddojahad kerani padi
 Finally, on the orders of the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, he managed to get a UA certificate
 ab raahat kii saans lete hue ve bataate hai ki ''is film main do kishoron kii prem kahani ke saath ghati kii vaastaviktaaon ko dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 The simple aim is that the youth of the country can communicate with the youth of Kashmir so that they can get to know and understand the problems there
 "sensor board ke saath hui takaraar ke chalate aswin uski kaamkaaj kii style par ungali rakhana chaahate hai
 They relate this to the latest attack on two mosques in New Zealand, "now see the way the attack took place in New Zealand and killed 50 people
" us vaake ko sidhe utyub par dikhaa diya gaya
 What does censor board mean after that? The board tried to ban No Fathers in Kashmir to prevent the truth from unfolding
 "aswin ne apni is film ke liye logon se thodaa-thodaa karke fund jamaa kiya he, jisamen landan main rahane vaale kashmiriyon ne bhi sahyog kiya he
 Ashwin's short film Little Terrorist (2004) was nominated for an Oscar

 "actually his film is based on a report by the Human Rights Commission

 It is suspected that he has been murdered
 film kii kahani aage badhati he
 The army men catch both but leave the girl
 aswin aage kaa kissa nahin bataate
 Fashion designer Ritu Kumar's son Ashwin has an old relationship with Kashmir
 unke dada kashmir ghati ke hi bascindia the
 Ashwin looked at Kashmir closely for ten years and gained much experience
 kashmir se judi samvedansheeltaa kaa pahalu bhi unke dimag main acchhee tarah he
 That's when he says, "it is not my motive to misrepresent the army in the film
" maine hakeekat dikhaai he
 "absolutely Ashwin," the film is the story of the entire village, of the entire village
 vahaan ke aam logon kii jindagi ko dikhaane kii hamane koshish kii he
 Kashmir is sometimes in discussion with the militants, sometimes because of stones and sometimes for some other reasons
 is tarah ke halaat main vahaan ke aam jan aakhir kis tarah jindagi jite hai, un par kya bitati he, use bhi darshana cinema kii jimmedaari he
 "it was a difficult task to shoot this film in the real locale of his story, ie Kashmir
 ve bataate hai, ''yakeen kiijie, yah aasaan nahin tha
 The atmosphere is such that brother cannot trust brother
 parivaar ke log ek-duusare par bharosa nahin karte
 So much suspicion has been created that everyone there suspects each other
 fouj kashmiri par shaq karti he or kashmiri khud kashmiriyon par
 Reason for doubt: Anyone, at any time under any circumstances can go missing
 aise main mere liye bhi vahaan sau logon ke kru ko le jaakar shoot karnaa kitna riski ho saktaa tha, aap samaj sakate hai
 Despite that we have done
 par hamane film kaa naam badalakar shooting kii
 The film was named Noor
 matlab kisi ko shaq na ho ki ham kya kar rahe hai
 "they are saddened by what has been happening there for the last 30 years
 ''hamaare desh main ek aisi jagah he jahaan khule taur par ek-duusare se baat nahin kar sakate
 Can not say what they think
 kaaphi aise log hai jo dabaane kii koshish karte hai, maar bhi dete hai
 In such an environment, filmmakers are not only going to capture the beauty of Kashmir but are also making films on the problems there

 But senior party leader Kumar Vishwas did not appear in this meeting, so it is natural to speculate on the news of differences once again
 tippaniyan One of the reasons for the Aam Aadmi Party's defeat in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi was that the party's communication with itself and the public was cut off at different levels, so that the public could not get an accurate picture of the 2-year functioning of the Kejriwal government

 In the absence of official data, the legal price of this blueprint may be under the weight of the trash, but the ticket-sharing giants are roaming this thick book
 or isamen se nikle jati-mantra tikataarthiyon kii kismat kaa faisla kar rahe hai
 The interesting thing is that even though the water of the state is such that the tune of victory will be heard even after serving the hundred stringed santoor of the caste, there is no guarantee

 Barring a few districts, Dalits are the second largest vote bank in other places
 vahiin 20 jile aise hai, jahaan muslim voter sabase zyada hai or 20 jilon main ve doosraa sabase bada vot bank he
 There are three more prominent castes that draw the lines of the political mustache of the province - the Yadavs, the Thakurs and the Brahmins
 sankhya ke lihaaj se pradesh kaa sabase bada samudaay obisi he
 If Hindu and Muslim obcs are included, then their number is the highest in every district
 lekin obisi samooh ke taur par vot nahin karte
 The largest caste of OBC is Yadav
 pradesh ke 44 jilon main yadav jati ke votaron kii sankhya 8 fisadi se upar he or inamen se 9 jilon main yadavon kii hissedari 15 fisadi yaa isse upar he

 It is clear from the frenzy that the BSP has given tickets to the Brahmins that the party is following the strategy of the last assembly election

 In 60 districts, the number of Brahmin voters is more than 8 percent, while in 29 districts this number is above 12 percent
 basapa ne 74, bhaajapa ne 73, sapa ne 50 or congress ne 42 or ralod ne 3 brahmanon ko tikat diya he
 On the question of the kindness of politics on Brahmins, State Congress President Rita bahuguna-joshi said, 'brahmin is the most educated class
 apane aas-paas ke parivesh main uskaa sammaan or sweekaaryata he
 In such a situation, despite being less in number, Brahmins are generally successful in connecting the other communities with them
 ' yahaan yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki in dinon rahul gandhi bundelkhand daure main janardan dvivedi ko brahman chehre ke taur par pesh kar rahe hai
 Like the Brahmins, the parties are also careful in giving tickets to the Thakurs
 basapa ne 51, bhaajapa ne 74, congress ne 55 or sapa ne 45 evam ralod ne 4 thakuron ko tikat diya he
 Thakurs are also spread across the state and their average attendance is between 5 and 6 per cent
 purvanchal ke jilon main thakur or bhoomihaar matadaataaon kii hissedari 10 fisadi ke aasapaas tak pahunch jaati he

 sankhya main kam hone ke baavjood thakuron ko khub tikat milane ke sawaal par banda se congress vidhayak or thakur birdari ke numaayinde vivek singh ne kaha, 'pehali baat to yah ki congress jaat dekhakar tikat nahin detii
 Secondly, Kshatriyas always carry all sections of the society together
 samaaj main unki vyapak sweekaaryata he
 That is why many people of this community managed to get tickets
 'in teen pramukh jatiyon kii tulana main vaisya yaa baniyaa samudaay kii aabaadi pradesh main kam he, lekin apni aarthik takat ke kaaran inaki darkaar har party ko rahati he
 Congress has fielded 12, BJP 22 and other parties have also fielded Vaishya candidates in the same proportion
 kurmi jati bhi uttar pradesh chunaav main ahm bhoomika nibhaayegi
 The strong presence of Kurmi caste can be seen in Sant Kabir Nagar, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Bareilly, Unnao, Jalaun, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Sitapur, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Siddharth Nagar and Basti districts
 in 16 jilon main kurrmi matadaata 6 se 10 fisadi ke bich hai
 For the Kurmi votes, Congress is leading Beni Prasad Verma and BJP Vinay Katiyar
 kurmi ke alaava lodh yaa lodhi matadaata bhi soobe main badi takat hai
 BJP had a big Lodh face as Kalyan Singh earlier, this time BJP has brought forward Lodh face as Uma Bharti

 jati kaa yah janjaal dekhakar lagata he ki kanshiram ke dinon kaa basapai naaraa-jisaki jitani sankhya baari, uski utani hissedari, kaamyaab hona chahie
 But where is the politics so easy, otherwise the representatives of the Dalit community with 20 to 22 percent of the population still do not have to be forced to try their luck on a safe seat only
 jati kii raajnneeti kii academik vyakhya karte hue jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke professor anand kumaar ne kaha, 'bharat ho yaa uttar pradesh, yahaan ab bhi dominent cast demacresi (prabhu jati prajatantr) kaa hi bolbalaa he

 daliton ke paas pehali or chauthi yogyata he, lekin duusari or teesri main ve ab bhi peeche hai
 'muslims are in the same situation
 bhaajapa ko aakhir ek hi muslim pratyaashee kyon mila, is sawaal par bhaajapa netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, 'party ne ek darjan muslim pratyaashiyon ko tikat dene kaa man banaaya tha
 But the ticket contenders came to the party were not strong
 aise main party ko behatar pratyaashee ke chayan ko hi tarjeeh deni padi
 The rest of the parties did not skimp in giving tickets to Muslims
 basapa ne 85, congress ne 62, sapa ne 80 or ralod ne 8 muslimon ko tikat diya he
 On Muslim politics, Kalkab Hameed of RLD said, 'the problem is that in Muslim-majority areas a lot of Muslim candidates stand, in such a way the vote gets divided and the Muslim candidate does not win
 ' ralod ne is baar pashchimi uttar pradesh se 8 muslim pratyaashiyon ko maidan main utaara he
 Senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan has some positive views on this division of Muslim votes
 unhone kaha, 'jaahir taur par bahut se muslim pratyaashee chunaav maidan main hai
 But this time everyone knows which candidate to vote for
 is baar muslim vidhayakon kii sankhya badhegi
 Azam himself represents the Rampur seat of more than 42 per cent of Muslim voters
 agar janata kaa numaayinda bananaa he to jati-samikarnon kii bhul-bhulaiya se guzarana padegaa
 But remember that in this equation, leaders of every caste and caste only double their figures
 jati ke jabaani aankade maan liye to pradesh kii aabaadi doguni kerani padegi, jo bheed se pate soobe kii sehat ke liye thik nahin he
 Well, it would have been better if every man would have voted like a citizen and would have found the real meaning of the community in his original Persian word Biradar (brother)

 While the opposition is adamant on seeking a joint parliamentary committee inquiry into the 2G spectrum scam and other matters, the ruling party is demanding the removal of the Yeddyurappa government of the BJP in Karnataka

 On the other hand, some people have expressed curiosity as to why BJP is adamant on the demand of JPC itself
 2ji spectrum ghotaale par jepisi ke gathan se kiskaa koun-sa hit sadhegaa
 Ashok Singhal answered all the questions carefully
 aise main to yahi lagata he ki satta paksh ho yaa vipaksh kisi ko bhi janata se matlab nahin he or donon hi apni apni baat manwaane main jor laga rahe hai

 At the same time, Lalu's staunch opponent and JD (U) president Sharad Yadav is MP from Madhepura who is ahead of Lalu but not so much that he is called a pass

 aise main to yahi lagata he ki bihar main agar nitish sarkaar ne vidhayak fund band karne kii pahal kii he to isamen hairaani kii baat nahin
 Shahnawaz Hussain, MP from Bhagalpur in Bihar, who has spent only two and a half crores, says that every member should spend the money received under this head
 ho saktaa he ki enditivi india par khabar dikhaae jane ke baad saansad kharch karen or janata bhi inpar dabaav daale
 In such a situation, it seems that if the Nitish government has taken the initiative to close the MLA fund in Bihar, it is not surprising
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle sabhi raajnneetik dal apane-apane str par gathbandhan ko antim rup main dene main jute hai
 Even after the SP-BSP coalition with the intention of stopping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had made a clean sweep in Uttar Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha elections this time, the alliance with many smaller parties in the state continues to be practiced
 congress kii bhi koshish rajya main badi party banakar ubharne kii he or vah bhi kai chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan kii taiyaariyon main juty he
 This time the Congress is continuously claiming to play on the front foot in Uttar Pradesh, but while playing on the front foot, it has also hesitated to tie up with Shivpal Yadav
 yah sach he ki congress ne bijepi or mahagathbandhan se bache tamaam dalon ke saath apni sabhi sampark line khol di he
 One thing that is constantly being discussed is whether the new party of Shivpal Yadav, who split from the Samajwadi Party and formed a new party, will be part of the alliance of the Progressive Samajwadi Party Congress? The silence of the Congress is saying a lot on this
 darasal, congress party shivpal yadav se sampark main he isaki pushti congress or shivpal yadav donon kar chuke hai lekin jab donon taiyaar hai to gathbandhan main aakhir pench kahaan fansaa he?akhilesh se naaraazgi kaa dar!raajnneetik vishleshkon kii maane to congress, shivpal yadav ke saath gathbandhan main nahin jaaegi kyonki agar congress or shivpal yadav ne gathbandhan kiya to samaajawaadee party chodi gai raibareli or amethi kii seat par apane candidet utaar sakati he or agar candidet nahin bhi utaara to use haraane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 The leadership of the Congress is well aware that taking Shivpal Yadav along means directly challenging Akhilesh Yadav and turning political opposition into political enmity, that is why the Congress Party is meeting Shivpal Yadav Despite positive signs, she is not able to openly talk to the alliance
 pichley dinon priyanka gandhi ke lakhanu daure ke dauraan priyanka ke kareebi maane jane vaale emelsi deepak singh or shivpal yadav kii kaanaafoosee karti tasviir surkhiyon main ai thi, lekin haftebhar baad bhi gathbandhan ko lekar koi baat nahin ban saki
 Now it remains to be seen whether the Congress leaves Shivpal Yadav alone under the pressure of Amethi and Rae Bareli or whether the Congress, which is claiming to play on the front foot, also carries the threat of Shivpal Yadav

 shariatapar bahes thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 The beginning begins with the institutions that lead to the Muslims and the debate reaches political profit-loss
 teen talaak, halaala, muta or misyar (contract marij) par bahes ke bich ol india muslim personal lau board kii ore se desh ke sabhi jilon main 'daarul kaja' yani islamic sharia centre kholane ke elaan ne sharia par ek nai bahes ko janm de diya he
 While a section of the country is trying to declare 'darul Kaja' as a parallel judicial system and a Shari'i court, the board is calling it a subsidiary and arbitral system of judicial system as provided in the Constitution
 haalanki 'daarul kaja' desh main pehle se chal rahe hai lekin aam chunaav se thik pehle is mudde se dhruvikaran kii bhoomika banaai ja rahi he
 On July 8, All India Muslim Personal Law Board Member and Senior Advocate Zafaryab Jilani spoke of the "proposal to open 'darul Kaja' in every district of the country, followed by their constitutional and legal at social and political levels
 The debate over justification broke out
 haalanki, vishwalochan madan kii janhit yachika par bahes ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne 12 may, 2009 ko supreme court main kaha tha, ''bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 26 main sabhi dharmon or samudaayon ko dharmik swatantraaa kii guarantee di gai he, jiske tahat ve daarul kaja yaa sharia pranali sahit apane dharmarth sansthaanon kii sthapana, unka sanchaalan or prabandhan kar sakate hai
 "as such, this PIL was rejected by the Supreme Court on 7 July 2014, saying," These are not parallel judicial systems
 inke paas na to koi kanoonee adhikaar he or na hi inke nirnay kanoonee rup se badhyakaari hai
 The court refused permission to ban the operation of such centers
 lekin yah vyavastha bhi di thi, ''dharm aadhaarit vichaaron yaa nirdeshon ko jabaran lagu karnaa avaidh or moulik adhikaron kaa ulanghan hoga
 "actually, they are being run by Jamiat ulema-hind as mahkama-e-sharia (sharia Department), Muslim Personal Law Board by Darul Qaza (kazi center) and bhawan-e-sharia as Sharai Panchayat, where Settlement is recommended under Shariah in matters of marriage, divorce and property share of Muslims
 1993 se personal lau board ke adheen hi desh bhar main 50 aise daarul kaja sanchalit hai
 The question is, when the Supreme Court has rejected the PIL to ban them, how much is it right to increase their number before the elections? Maulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehalvi, president of Anjuman minhaj-e-rasool, says, "not necessarily Everything should be made public
 chunavi varsh main muslim netritv ko bayaanbaji se parhez karnaa chahie
 "islamic scholar Khalid Anwar Puranvi says," As soon as the words Shari Adalat and Shari Adalat arrive, the imagination of parallel legal system starts emerging, but it is not so
 '' idhar 'daarul kaja' par chhidi bahes ko lekar centre main aae ol india muslim personal lau board ke liye yah nai fajihat he
 After losing in the Supreme Court on triple talaq, decisions on practices like Halala, Muta and Misyar are yet to come
 inamen se ek yachikakarta dow
 Sameena Begum is fighting against the existence of the board in the Supreme Court itself
 ve kahati hai, ''hamane supreme court se maang kar rakhi he ki muslim personal lau (sharia) aavedan adhinium, 1937 kii dhara 2 ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 14e 15e 21 or 25 kaa ulanghan karne vaala ghoshit kiya jaae
 Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, secretary and spokesperson of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, says, "darul Qaza is not a parallel court, but an adjunct to conciliation courts that have been operating in different cities in the country since independence
 board isi vyavastha kaa vistaar un kshetron main karnaa chahta he, jahaan abhi daarul kaja nahin hai
 "on the other hand, according to Syed Wasim Rizvi, chairman of the UP Shia Central Waqf Board under the Uttar Pradesh government, running a Sharia court comes under treason
 unke anusaar, ''hindustan main sharia hukumat nahin he
 In such a situation, it is wrong to appoint Qazi (judge) by the board
 bharat sarkaar ko tatkaal ol india muslim personal lau board par pabandi laga deni chahie
 "but Maulana Rahmani does not agree with this, he dismisses Rizvi's statement saying," Some people are maligning a better job
 ''desh ke har jile main daarul kaja kholane kii board kii yojana kaa koi khaakaa taiyaar nahin he
 It is to be discussed in a meeting between the board members in New Delhi on 15 July

 P
 choudhary ne tikhi pratikriya dete hue kaha, ''court kaa gathan samvidhan ke tahat banaai gai vyavastha ke jariye hi hota he
 Obviously, the Sharia Court will have no legal existence

 There is no place for Sharia Court in any district, village or city
 ''teen talaak ke tareeke par sawaal uthaane vaali pehali yachikakarta syra bano bhi har jile main daarul kaja kholane ke faisle ko mahilaon ke liye bematlab maanati hai
 She says, "before going to court, i had also discussed the issue of my divorce with a mufti
 lekin unhone khat ke jariye talaak ko jaij tehraaya tha
 The Mufti had clearly said that now nothing can be done in this issue, divorce has been done
 '' masalaa saaf he ki daarul kaja keval ek aisi sanstha he jahaan muslim apane masale lekar kaaji ke paas ja sakate hai
 If the verdict is not right, then you are free to go to court

 This is just a political shigufa left
 '' jis tarah se daarul kaja ke kanoonee darje ko lekar vivaad khadaa kiya ja rahaa he or muslim personal lau board kisi bhi masale par do kadam aage badhkar do kadam peeche hat jaataa he
 By the way, it seems that by raising new issues of Sharia, it is preparing the ground for political profit and loss
 kya he daarul kaja?koi bhi paksh, mahila yaa purush apni arji daarul kaja main jaakar detaa he
 Qazi issues notice to both parties
 sunwaayee ke dauraan islamic sharia ke mutabik, likhit faisla sunaaya jaataa he
 However, Qazi has no power in India to enforce the decision forcefully
 isko maananaa yaa na maananaa donon pakshon par nirbhar karata he
 The Muslim Personal Law Application Act in India was passed in 1937
 british shaskaon kii manshaa thi ki ve bharatiyon par unke saanskrithik niyamon ke tahat shashan karen
 The decisions of Muslims on marriage, divorce, inheritance and family disputes are made under this act and the government cannot interfere in them

 The Hindu Succession Act was enacted in 1956
 iske tahat hindu, buddha, jain or sikhon main viraasat main mili sampatti kaa bantwaaraa hota he
 In addition, the Parsi marriage-divorce Act of 1936 and the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 are examples of this
 *** Political rhetoric on the terrorist attack in Amritsar is also happening rapidly
 aam aadmi party ke netaa eches phulka ne ravivaar ko kuch aisa bayaan diya jis par jamkar bavaal ho rahaa he
 When he targeted the army chief for this attack, many leaders objected to his statement
 phulka ke is bayaan par punjab congress ke pravaktaa rajkumaar verka ne kadi ninda kii he
 Describing Phoolka as a mental bankrupt, he said that the army chief and soldiers of our country are our pride and by making such statements about him, he insulted the army
 haalanki, bayaan par bavaal ke baad ech es phulka ne safai bhi di
 He later said that his statement was misrepresented
 unhone kaha ki meraa bayaan congress ke khilaaf tha, naa ki sena pramukh ke khilaaf tha
 On the other hand, the Akali Dal has condemned this attack in Amritsar
 akali dal ne isko lekar rajya kii congress sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that law and order in the state has completely collapsed
 shiad pramukh sukhbir singh badal ne daawa kiya ki congress ke satta main aane ke baad punjab main kanoon vyavastha bigadi he
 He alleged that the Congress government was promoting such elements whose sole purpose is to disturb the peace of Punjab
 badal ne ek bayaan main kaha ki durbhaagya se vartmaan kii congress sarkaar shanti kii apeksh raajnneeti ko tarjeeh detii he
 SAD leader and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal took a dig at Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and tweeted, "first bomb and now grenade attack in Amritsar, now what Raja saheb?" When you and your ministers will stop promoting the weighing elements in order to break the difficultly achieved peace
 raajnneeti karnaa band kariye or gambhirthapurvak shashan kii ore dhyaan dijie
 The people of Punjab do not want to return to the Black Chapter
 ’’kya tha phulka kaa bayaan?punjab ke aam aadmi party ke vidhayak or vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa rahe echesphulkane vivaadit bayaan diya
 He has blamed Army Chief Bipin Rawat for the terrorist attack in Nirankari Samagam in Amritsar
 unhone kaha, '' senadhyaksh bipin ravat punjab main aakar bol gaye the ki rajya par aatanki hamale kaa khatra he
 It is possible that they have got their people blasted so that their statement does not prove to be wrong

 5 million america dollar kaa nivesh karata he to vah bhi antigua kii naagarikta paa saktaa he

 jiske aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki mehul chokasee ne apane faraar rahane ke dauraan hientigua kaa passporthasil kar liya, jiske baad ab vah vahiin pahunch gaya he
 The day after Mehul Choksi arrived in Antigua, Indian investigative agencies had talked about his extradition from the US

 a picture came four months ago
 tasviir upi ke badaayun kii thi
 In the picture, the bodies of two sisters were seen hanging on the tree
 tab us tasviir or tasviir ke peeche kii kahani ne puure desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya tha par ab chaar maheene baad usee maamle ne achaanak you turn le liya he
 a U-turn after which the whole story seems to be reversing and this U-turn has come after the eye detector test of the only witness in this case
 takreeban saadhe teen maheene baad ab vahi maamla sir ke bal yani bilkul ulta khadaa dikhaai dene laga he
 In other words, there has been a U-turn in the investigation of this case, which has also turned the head of the cbi's raiding officers who are investigating the case
 isaki sidhi si vajah bas itani he ki vaardaat kaa shikaar hui donon ladakiyon ke gharavaalon ke baad ab is maamle kaa iklauta chashmadid bhi sibiai ke laai-ditection test main fail ho gaya he
 Actually, Baburam alias Nazru is the person who last saw the two sisters before the murder, or rather, it is said that Nazru had said that in the statement given to the police, on the evening of May 26, these sisters were last seen
 
 najaru ne yahaan tak kaha ki in donon hi bahanon ko gaanv hi ek noujvaan pappu yadav apane saath le ja rahaa tha or jab usne pappu ko rokane kii koshish kii, to usne tamancha dikhaa kar najaru ko vahaan se bhaga diya
 Apparently, due to this statement of Nazru, the needle of suspicion in the case directly went to Pappu and when the next day morning the dead body of both sisters was found hanging from the tree, Pappu was the target of everyone
 dhire-dhire tafteesh aage badi or pappu ke saath-saath kul paanch log is maamle main giraftaar kar liye gaye
 But when the investigation of the case was handed over to the CBI and he decided to investigate it before pursuing the investigation, he got the first shock when the girls' family members failed the lie detection test
 yani isse pehle najaru ke bayaan kii tasdik karte hue gharavaalon ne jin logon ko apni betiyon kii jaan lene ke iljaam lagaae the, test ke dauraan wo puri tarah un baton par kaayam nahin rah sake
 In such a situation, the CBI now had no choice but to lie detection of Baburam alias Nazru
 lihaaza, usne maamle ko aage badhaane se pehle us gavaah ko bhi tatolane kaa faisalaa kiya, jiske bayaan par puraa maamla tikaa tha, lekin sibiai kii hairaani kaa tab koi parawar nahin rahaa, jab forensik lab se mili report se ye saafe ho gaya ki ladakiyon ke gharavaalon kii tarah nazaru jhooth-sach ke khel main ulajhaa tha
 Not only was he shaken by his statement in the lie detection test, but he was also told that he also had a mobile phone, while earlier Nazru denied that he had a mobile phone
 jaahir he, kuch aisa jarur tha, jise najaru chhipaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha

 The NCP, an important constituent of the ruling UPA at the Center, targeted Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday for making a statement attributing coalition compulsions to inflation
 party ne kaha ki unke bayanon main ahankaar kii bajaay vinamrata jhalkani chahie

 darasal, aaj tak kii team ne jabamosulaki jameen par paanv rakhaa to paaya ki puure saade teen saal baad mosul se bagdadi ke aatank kaa ant to hua, lekin peeche chhod gaya barbaadi ke gahare nishaan
 The ground reality and photos of Mosul were in front of Aaj Tak's team
 magar sabase ahm sawaal kaa jawaab abhi bhi hamaari team ko nahin mila tha ki aakhir 39 bhartiya mosul main kahaan laapata ho gaye
 Our team wanted to find their clue
 lekin ye kaam itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Because most people here did not know anything about those missing Indians
 iraqi sena or intelligence ke paas bhi un hindustaniyon ke koi pukhta saboot yaa phir jaankaree nahin thi
 But still our team had to try
 hamaari team 39 laapata bharatiyon kii talash main jute gai
 Indeed, the missing Indians were last seen in the Badush area of mosul
 par kis jagah kisi ko nahin pataa
 That is why the Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh himself also reached there in search of him
 unhone baqayada ek raat mosul main guzari thi
 Now the last hope was on the DNA report
 bharat sarkaar ne39 bharatiyon kaa denesample iraqi adhikariyon ko saunp diya tha
 After this, the Minister of State for External Affairs returned to India
 unke lautne ke kuch vakt baad iraqi adhikariyon ko badoosh ke sthaneey logon se pataa chalaa ki badoosh ke kareeb ek pahari par aies ke aatankwaadiyon ne bahut se logon ko maar kar tile ke neeche dafna diya he
 Later, when that mound was excavated, 39 skeletons were found from there
 laapata bharatiyon kii taadaad bhi 39 thi
 It is suspected that these dead bodies are probably of the same 39 missing Indians
 baad main kankal se baraamad bal, kade or juuton se yakeen hone laga ki marane vaale hindustani hi hai
 So the DNA of all the dead bodies was now mixed with the DNA that the Minister of State for External Affairs had taken to Iraq
 38 laashon ke diene laapata bharatiyon se match kar gaye
 That is, it was proved that those Indians missing since June 2014 were killed by Baghdadi terrorists only
 ye baat pichley teen saal se bharat sarkaar bhi jaanati thi
 But she was avoiding announcing his death
 kyonki sarkaar ke paas koi saboot nahin tha
 Now if the evidence is found, the death was sealed and along with it the hopes of the families who were waiting for their lives to be buried
 ab un sabhi gharon main matam pasra he
 There are 3 such shrines of Shakti, at which rate, the devotees get unlimited peace and all their sorrows and suffering are destroyed
 pashchim bengal ke birbhum main maujuud maa tara ke dham par bhakton ke har dukh ko maa har leti he
 One of the 10 Mahavidyas never returns empty handed at the rate of mother Tara
 shankh ke pavitra naad se goonjata maa kaa darbar, devi darshan ko aatur shraddhaluon kii bheed, mata ke geeton ko gaate-gunagunaate bhakt, man main bhakthi or aankh main pal bhar maa ko nihaar lene kii chahat
 This supernatural scene of devotion is seen in the temple of Maa Tara
 jo ki bhakton ko baandh letaa he, bhakthi ke ras main dubo detaa he
 Many stories of the miracle of the mother are heard here, so many stories about the construction of the temple are prevalent
 mana jaataa he ki samudr manthan ke samay jab bhagwaan shiv ne vishpan kiya tha to vish ke prabhaav se unka kanth nila pad gaya or vish ke asar ko kam karne ke liye maa tara ne unhen stanpan karaayaa tha
 Lord Shiva still sits in the mother's lap in the statue of mother Tara present in this temple
 mandir banane ke baad prakritik kaarnon se do baar mandir puri tarah se nasht ho gaya tha lekin maa kii murti ko koi nuksaan nahin pahuntaa jiske baad unke bhakton ne pun: is mandir kaa jirnonddhaar karaayaa
 The worship of Mother Tara begins at the temple from 3 o'clock in the morning to worship the mother Tara
 subah-severe sabase pehle maa ko snaan karaayaa jaataa he jisamen gulabjal, gangaajal, shahad, ghi or java kusum kaa tel prayog kiya jaataa he
 Bathing the mother is believed to be an integral part of worship in which the use of alcohol is mandatory
 snaan ke baad baari aati he maa ke shringaar kii
 The mother is dressed in a grand appearance by wearing a royal dress, crown, hair, vermilion and bindi
 puja paath kii in sabhi rasmon ke bich sabase anokhi baat he ki maa kii aarti ke baad sabase pehle maa ko mishri ke pani kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he
 In this way, Kheer, curd, sweet khichdi, vegetable and five types of dish are offered to the mother throughout the year, but it is very important to have sweets in the mother's enjoyment
 kehete hai maa ko mithai kaa bhoga lagane se maa jald prasann hokar bhakton ko de detii hai manachaaha vardaan
 In the evening before the Sandhya Aarti, the mother is adorned with flowers and the doors of the temple are closed only after offering cold enjoyment at night
 aamtaur par bhakt to din main hi mata kii puja archana karte hai lekin tantra sadhana karne vaale raat main maa kii sadhana karte hue dikhaayi dete hai
 It is said that for the attainment of secret knowledge, those who do spiritual practice here definitely get the blessings of the mother
 mandir ke paas hi nadi ke kinare shmashaan ghat ke paas kai sadhak ghanton tapasya kar maa se siddhiyaan praapt karte hai
 Virajati Maa Nalateshwari Devi in birbhum itself
 kehete hai jab mata sati ke sharir ko lekar shiv tandav kar the tab bhagwaan vishnu ne apane chakra se sati ke sharir ke tukade-tukade kar die
 The same place in Birbhum fell on the neck of the mother, due to which the name of this mother's dham was Nalateshwari
 roshni main nahaaya mandir ek sati kii mahima, aasthaa kii jeet or ek raja ke ghamand tuutane kii kahani kahata he
 This is the story of Nalateshwari Devi temple in Birbhum district of West Bengal
 nalateshwari devi
 
 
 One of the 51 Shaktipeeths of the country
 
 
 shakti kaa wo param dham jahaan giri thi sati ke gale kii nalee jiske chalate is pavitra darbar kaa naam hi pad gaya nalateshwari devi mandir
 Actually, when Shiva's mother Parvati became Sati due to insult to her father, Lord Shiva started doing Tandava with her body
 sristi main sanhaar ke dar se vishnu ne apane sudarshan chakra kaa sahaara liya or parvati ke sharir ke kai tukade kar die
 Where those pieces fell, they were called shakti-peetha
 unheen shaktipeethon main se ek he nalateshwari devi mandir
 It is said that the neck of Mother Sati fell here
 varshon baad mata ne ek bhakt ko sapane main darshan die jiske baad is bhavy mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya
 The tube under the mother's statue represents the same event in which water is still filled for 24 hours
 pattharon se bich ghiri is nalee main aaj bhi jal kaa str ek samaan bana rahata he
 It is believed that if Nalateshwari Devi is worshiped by law, then the mother also gives her immediate fruit and if there is any cracks in your chanting relationship then you want to bring sweetness in your relationships, then the head in the court of the mother Relationships come from all over Navane
 maa kaa aashirwad paane ke liye subah savere snaan karakar devi kaa bhavy sinduri shringaar kiya jaataa he uske baad shuru hoti he subah kii mangala aarti
 The mother is offered fish, rice in the enjoyment
 aamtaur par yahaan har din maa kii aise hi puja kii jaati he lekin durgapuja or kaali puja par is mandir kii chata dekhte hi banati he
 Mahaprasad is organized in this court of Mother
 iske alaava jyeshtha maheene kii shashthee kaa din bhi khaas hota he is din mandir main vishesh aayojan hota he
 This day in Baganal is called Jamai Shashthi and on this day lakhs of devotees come here and take the blessings of mother
 ab padhie mirzapur ke vindhya parvat par virajman maa ashtabhuja kii mahima ke bare main
 Mother Ashtabhuja, who removes fear, blesses success, is a mother who gives blessings of wisdom and wisdom, defeats difficulties
 is siddhapitha kii visheshta hi yahi he ki yahaan se kabhi koi khaali haath nahin jaataa, yahaan koi pukaar kabhi ansuni nahin rahati, raja ho yaa rank, maa yahaan sabhi par ek samaan krupa barsaati hai
 This holy abode of Maa Ashtabhuja is situated at the western end of Maa Vindhyavasani, residing on Mount Vindhya in Mirzapur
 pehali baar maa ashtabhuja kaa naam sunakar lagata he ki maa aath bhujaaon vaale rup main detii hai bhakton ko darshan lekin maa ke naam kii kahani unke rup se nahin balki unki is parvat par sthapit hone se judi he
 It is said that in order to liberate the earth from the increasing tyranny of Kamsa in Dwapara Yuga, the Garg Rishi performed harsh penance to please the mother on Mount Vindhya, after which the mother was born as a girl in the house of Nand Baba
 lekin vasudev bhagwaan shrikrishna ko gokul chhodkar kanya ko apane saath karagaar main le aae
 When Kansa got the news of Devaki's eighth child, Kansa tried to throw the girl on the stone as the girl flew into the air and assumed the form of Ashtabhuja Devi
 vindhya parvat maa ashtabhuja ke rup main maa yogamaya ke hi darshanon kaa saubhaahgya bhakton ko miltaa he jinhen bhakt maa ashtabhuja ke naam se puujate hai or is baat kaa pramaan dete hai maa ke charnon par maujuud ungaliyon ko nishaan
 It is said that these are fingerprints of Kansa
 maa ashtabhuja ko vaise samast manokamanaayon kii purti karne vaala mana jaataa he lekin vishesh taur par bhakt maa ko gyaan kii devi ke rup main puujate hai
 Those who are done with offerings of coconut and flowers like the common temples of the mother are pleased
 manyata he ki ek baar maa kaa aashirwad mil jaae to bade se bada sankat bhi dur ho jaataa he or kaam main safalataa milane lagati he
 This magnificent form of Maa Ashtabhuja draws devotees towards him
 ye devi ke prati shraddha or vishwaas hi he ki navaratri main maa vindhyavacini ke darshan kar bhakt maa ashtabhuja ke darshan jarur karte hai
 And consider themselves blessed

 For example, the body mass of the children was checked, their eating habits were observed and their teacher was also informed about their behavior
 bataa den, bacchon kii sangati bhi unke vyaktitv par kaaphi prabhaav daalati he, isliye us pahalu ko bhi study kaa hissaa banaaya gaya
 The results of this comprehensive study did not appear satisfactory at all
 study ke mutabik jin gharon main logon ne apane chote bacchon ke bedroom main unke liye ek personal tivi lagava rakhaa tha, un bacchon ke vikaas par galat prabhaav pad rahaa tha
 In those children, future high BMI, trend towards junk food, depression etc

 Different opposition parties are busy making issues related to demonetisation
 ab is hangaame se kahin janata notebandi par bhadak na jaae, bijepi ne bhi shaayad yahi sochakar sadak par utarane kaa man bana liya he
 Starting from Delhi, thousands of BJPK workers are preparing to land on the road in Delhi on Friday, with the aim of creating an atmosphere in support of demonetisation
 bijepi ne ise sankalp march kaa naam diya he, jisamen 'ai saport modi' ke naare ke saath bijepi ke netaa or kaaryakarta sadak par utarak notebandi ke liye samarthan jutaayenge
 The purpose of BJP through this rally will be to convince the people that PM Modi has started a fight against black money by closing old notes, which will not only improve the economy of the country, but will also benefit the common man in the coming time
 
 saath hi bijepi kaa makasad ye bhi he ki vipaksh notebandi kaa virodh kar rahaa he, uske peeche aam logon kii bhalaai nahin, balki raajnneetik partiyon kaa apana apana swaarth he
 According to Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay, the main purpose of the Sankalp March is to alert people to the rumors being spread by the opposition
 tarah tarah kii bhraamak jaankaree logon ko di ja rahi he, jisase log notebandi kaa virodh karen, lekin ab bijepi ke kaaryakarta sadak par utarkar sidhe logon tak pahunchakar apni baat kahenge or unhen notebandi ke phaayde samajhaayenge
 BJP has also made a complete campaign for this, in which placards are made for the Sankalp Yatra with hoarding posters
 alag-alag naaron ke jariye logon ko notebandi ke phaayde ginaae jaaenge
 Among the benefits that the BJP is trying to enumerate after the demonetisation of the people, include the elimination of terrorism
 One advantage has been counted in a very populist manner
 isamen sabase pehla phayda aatankwaad or naksaliyon kii kamartod karrwai kaa he
 The poster claimed that demonetisation will help eliminate terrorism, because terrorism is thriving in the country only through black money
 ghar khareednaa hoga aasandusraa sabase bada phayda blike mani ko khatm karne ke taur par ginaya gaya he, kyonki is notebandi main bhrashtachar se kamaaye paise bekaar ho gaye hai
 As a third benefit, it has been claimed that demonetisation will reduce prices in the real estate sector and buying houses will now come under the auspices of the common man
 nakli karency khatm hogichautha phayda desh main bade paimaane par maujuud nakli karency yani nakli noton ke khatme kaa hoga
 Because fake notes of five hundred and thousand rupees came from Pakistan and were reducing the country's economy
 lekin notebandi se ab nakli karency kaa ant ho jayega
 bjp's Sankalp Yatra will start from Valmiki temple on Friday, which will go to Patel Chowk on Parliament Street
 iske liye party ne bade paimaane par taiyaariyaan kii he, taaki vipaksh ke bharat band yani 28 november ke pehle hi aam logon ke bich notebandi ke liye samarthan hasil kiya ja sake
 The BJP is also concerned about this because the Aam Aadmi Party has already agitated on the road in Delhi and is continuously protesting against demonetisation

 ' Defamation filed by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is going on in the court
 is maamle meservind kejarivalki taraf se desh ke janemaane vakil ram jethmalani cese lard rahe hai
 During the hearing on Monday, a total of 42 questions were asked to Ram Jethmalani to Arun Jaitley and there were several sharp arguments in the court
 sava do ghante chali sunwaayee main kai baar aise maukey aae jab court ne donon pakshon ko shant karavaaya
 What did Jethmalani say? In court, Jethmalani asked Jaitley whether PM Modi should be called as a witness in the court to authenticate your conduct as he has made you a minister in his cabinet
 wo hi aapke bare main behatar bataa sakate hai
 However, the court rejected Jethmalani's question
 sunwaayee ke dauraanram jethmalanine arun jetali se firozshah main hue nirmaan main paison ke kharch se jude sawaal puche
 The questions and answers were as follows
 jethmalani:manahani cese me arun jetali ne kaha ki firozshah kotla main stadium ke nirmaan ko lekar association ne sarkari niyamon ke mutabik hi kuch bijnes house se donneton liya gaya tha
 Ambani also proposed to give a donation of 22 crores
 jetali:iskaa faisalaa maine association par chhod diya tha
 Jethmalani: The MCD also proposed that if the stadium is named Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, then they will bear all the expenses of the stadium
 jetali:ye sirf ek prastaav tha,jisapar vichaar hi nahin kiya gaya tha
 Jethmalani: When you came to know that there was a proposal to name the stadium after Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, what was your opinion on it? Jaitley: There was no paperwork about it, so it was not seriously considered
 sarkari funds jo kisi bhi association ko die jate he, usamen bajet ko paas karavaaya jaataa he lekin is maamle me aisa kuch bhi nahi kiya gaya
 Government funds are not given to such a proposal, but the DDCA devised a variety of strategies to raise funds for themselves as Ferozeshah Kotla was not renamed, so it is not part of the minutes of the meeting
 jethmalani:aapane firozshah stadium ko self fund se viksit kiya kyonki aap isamen sarkari hastkshep nahi chaahate the
 Jaitley: This is completely wrong
 desh me aksar sarkari fund praivet association ko nahin diye jate he
 a contract was awarded to a private company for the construction work of Ferozeshah Stadium through bidding
 jethmalani:firozshah kotla main 57 karod rupaya political logon ne barbaad kiya
 What do you have to say on this? Jaitley: This allegation is false
 meri jaankaree or raay he ki jis tarah ke aarope mujh par lagaae gaye wo puri tarah galat the
 Based on the information i got from the media, i can say that the expenditure incurred on Firoz Shah's stadium was necessary for the stadium's modernization
 isliye 57 karod rupee ke galat istemaal kaa aarope puti tarah galat he
 The work done at Ferozeshah Stadium can be seen to verify whatever was spent
 17 may ko is maamle me hai court dobaaraa sunwaayee karegi
