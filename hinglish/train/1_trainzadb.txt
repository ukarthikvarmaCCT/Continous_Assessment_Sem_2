sabko ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Nobody should jump into it
 '' Senior Congress leader p Chidambaram said, 'every five years, before the elections, the BJP tries to polarize the Ram temple issue
 yah mudda ab adaalat ke saamne he
 Everyone should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court
 isamen kisi ko kudana nahin chahie
 '' lokapal vidheyak ke liye aam sahmati vaala masauda taiyaar karne kii prakriya buudhvaar ko vastut: patari se utarati najar ai
 In the joint committee meeting, a consensus could not be established between the government and the Gandhian Anna Hazare side
 baithak main faisla kiya gaya ki ab cabinet ke samaksh sanyukt masaude kii bajaay uske do sanskaran bheje jaaenge
 It became clear that by June 30, the same draft with mutual consent between the two sides is not likely to be ready now
 gahraate gatirodh or tikhi bayaanbaji ke daur ke baad sanyukt masauda samiti kii kareeb teen ghante chali baithak main sarkaar or hazaare paksh aam sahmati nahin bana sake
 After the meeting, Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal, who was included as the representative of the Center, told reporters, "there is no consensus between the two sides on the important and fundamental issues of the proposed Lokpal Bill
" hamane faisla kiya he ki 20 or 21 june ko hone vaali agali baithak main donon paksh apana-apana masauda charchaa ke liye rakhenge
 He said that if a consensus could not be reached on both the drafts then two different versions of the Lokpal Bill draft would be sent to the Cabinet
 ek sanskaran sarkaar kaa or doosraa saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa hoga
 This will be done so that no one says that the government is ignoring the draft Hazare Party
 sibbal ne kaha, main spasht kar dena chahta hum ki 30 june tak masauda taiyaar kar liya jaayegaa
 If there is no consensus, two versions of it will be sent to the cabinet
 is par samiti main hazaare paksh kii ore se shaamil artiai kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ne kaha, is baithak se koi nateeja nahin nikal paaya
 From the stand of the Center, it seems that the exercise that was going on for the last one and a half months was just a show off
 kejariwal ne kaha, matbhedon ke baavjood ham 20 or 21 june ko hone vaali sanyukt samiti kii agali baithak kaa bahishkaar nahin karenge
 We will give our draft to the government so that the public can see which draft is appropriate
 
 
 aisa prathit hota he ki sarkaar lokapal ke astitv main aane se pehle hi use nishprabhavi bana dena chaahati he
 The Sibal and Hazare side confirmed that in today's meeting there was no discussion on the issue of bringing the conduct of mps within the Prime Minister, High Judiciary and Parliament under the purview of the proposed Lokpal
 sibbal ne kaha, in muddon par baatcheet nahin hui he
 He said, the same document will be sent to the cabinet, but there will be two versions of the Lokpal Bill draft
 dastavej main spasht kiya jaayegaa ki donon pakshon ke bich kin-kin muddon par sahmati or asahmati he
 Both versions will be made public
 hamaari is prakriya main raajnneetik dalon ko bhi shaamil karne kii manshaa he
 Did the issue of allegations-counter-rounds between the two sides come up in the meeting, to which Sibal said, the members of the society told us that whatever allegations were made on their behalf, they would be about the representatives of the Center i was not ye aarope samiti ke baahar ke logon par lagaaye gayi the
 
 
 We hope that in future, the government will not be accused of vandalism, betrayal and lying
 baithak main hazaare paksh kaa ravaiya kaisaa tha, is par mantri ne kaha, unka ravaiya charchaa karne kaa hi tha
 We also want them to speak with impunity
 kejariwal se jab baithak ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, sarkaar sirf apane faisle suna rahi he
 The government is not listening to our arguments
 sarkaar kaaphi kadaa or adiyal rukh apanaaye hue he
 The government does not agree even on small issues
 unhone bataaya ki aaj kii baithak main do muddon par charchaa hui lekin ek bhi mudde par aam sahmati nahin ban paayi
 The first issue was that instead of a departmental and CBI inquiry against senior officials on charges of corruption, the same investigation should be conducted by the independent Lokpal
 doosraa mudda lokapal ke model par tha
 Kejriwal said that on the first issue the government did not agree and on the second issue, the government said that only the proposed 11-member Lokpal would decide on all matters and that the officers working under the 11-member body would not be given powers to investigate
 samiti main hazaare paksh kii ore se shaamil adhivaktaa prashanth bhushan ne kaha, aaj kii baithak se spasht ho gaya ki sarkaar or hamaare bich kai buniyadi muddon par gambhir matbhed hai
 It has now been concluded that two versions of the draft will be prepared, which will be placed before the cabinet
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki 11 sadasyeey lokapal ke adheen kaam karne vaale jaanch adhikariyon ko adhikaar nahin diye jaayen
 Only 11 member bodies dealt with all matters
 haalanki, hamaari ore se yah prastaavit he ki 11 sadasyeey nikaay ke adhinsth kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ke paas bhi swatantra jaanch ke adhikaar hon or unki bhi jimmedaariyaan tay kii jaayen
 Bhushan said that we have also told the government that in the United Nations anti-corruption Treaty itself it has been said that there should be an influential body to investigate corruption of government bureaucrats
 hamaari maang isse alag nahin he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, the BJP has returned to power once again with a strong majority
 bijepi purvottar se lekar dakshin bharat tak main camel khilaane main kaamyaab rahi he
 Rebel leaders of all opposition parties, including the Congress, are constantly becoming the strength of the BJP
 purvottar main hemanth biswa sarama, pashchim bengal main mukul roy, karnataka main es em krishna sahit haryana or uttar pradesh main vipaksh ke baagi netaa bijepi ke liye sanjivani banakar ubhare hai
 Hemant Biswa Trumpcard for BJP in the Northeast All states in the Northeast have become 'congress-free'
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main purvottar rajyon kii 25 loksabhaa siton main se 18 siten bijepi or uske sahyogi dal jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 Narendra Modi and Amit Shah may have played an important role in bjp's victory in the country, but Congress rebel Hemant Biswa Sarma has proved to be a trumpcard for BJP in feeding the lotus in the Northeast
 biswa ne agast, 2015 main congress chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman thama tha
 Since then, the BJP has been continuously winning in the Northeast
 bengal main bijepi ke taaranhar mukul royapaschim bengal kii siyasat main bijepi ne damdaar tareeke se apni jagah banaai he
 Since 2014, the bjp's graph has grown rapidly in the state
 isi kaa nateeja ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main soobe kii kul 42 main se 18 siten bijepi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 TMC rebel Mukul Roy played an important role in feeding lotus on the political land of Bengal
 roy ne pichley saal tiemasi kaa daaman chhodkar bijepi kaa haath thama tha
 Whereas in TMC, he was the second number after Mamata Banerjee
 tiemasi main rahete hue mukul roy booth str tak ke prabandhan ko sambhalate the
 The electoral management of Mukul Roy was the reason behind Mamata's occupation of the throne of Bengal power
 ab wo bijepi ke saath hai, aise main tiemasi ke liye bengal main badi chunauti he
 Congress rebel leader SM Krishna is believed to be a big role for bjp's victory in Karnataka from SM Krishna
 karnataka kii raajnneeti main vokkaliga samudaay ke vot kaaphi ahm maane jate hai
 It has been dominated by the Congress till now but this time it is being said that Vokkaliga's votes have been received by the BJP outright
 iske peeche es em krishna badi vajah maane ja rahe hai kyonki unhone kaaphi pehle se bijepi ke paksh main vot saadhane kii kavayad shuru kii thi
 As a result, BJP has managed to win 26 seats out of 28 seats in Karnataka
 jabaki pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi
 In Haryana, the monopoly rule of the BJP has been established in the politics of the Congress rebel, Shaktihariyana
 jabaki 2014 se pehle haryana kii raajnneeti main bijepi kaa koi khaas dakhal nahin tha
 Congress rebels Chaudhary Birendra Singh and Rao Inderjit joined the BJP and both these leaders wrote the script of victory
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 10 main se 7 siten bijepi jiti or isi ke baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne clin sweep karte satta main pehali baar ai
 This time in the Lok Sabha elections, Haryana managed to win all 10 seats
 is jeet main piem modi ke saath-saath congress ke baagi netaaon kii ahm bhoomik rahi he
 bjp's political dominance in Uttarakhand's rebellion in Uttarakhand's politics has been fully sustained
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi sabhi paanchon siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 This is the first time in the politics of Uttarakhand that the party in power has won all the seats
 jabaki isse pehle tak vipaksh dal ko hi jeet milti rahi he
 Those who joined the BJP after joining the BJP just before the assembly elections included veterans like Harak Singh Rawat and former CM Vijay Bahuguna and Yashpal Arya
 mana ja rahaa he in netaaon ke sahare bijepi ne uttarakhand main apni jagah jabardast banaai he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the power gained by the rebels, the BJP in Uttar Pradesh had managed to merge the rebel leaders of all parties, including the Congress
 isi kaa nateeja he ki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baad bijepi badi jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Before the 2017 assembly elections in the state, rebel leaders of several parties had joined BJP
 inamen reeta bahuguna joshi, swami prasad maury, brijesh pathak or iske alaava kai dalit chehre main bhi khaskar paasi samudaay ke netaaon bhagava rang main rach bas gaye
 This is the reason why the sp-bsp's caste equation could not feed
 kitaab:'garvanence for growth in india'keemat:195 rupelekhak:apije abdul kalampublication: roopa publicationpurv raashtrapati or jane-maane vaigyanik abdul kalam ne is kitaab main apane anubhavon or sujhaavon se garvanence ke alag-alag pahaluon ko samajhane kii behtareen koshish kii he
 Somewhere in this also there is a glimpse of his first book 'flight of Agni'
 kalam ne bhrashtachar, garvanence or javabdehi jaise masalon ke samaadhaan ke liye badhiya suzav die hai
 Progressive, optimistic and positive thinking, he has dreamed of an India that can ensure the development of every citizen of India
 aap chahen to is kitaab ko rodmap kii tarah istemaal karke bharat main sakaaratmak badlaav laa sakate hai
 While reading the book, you will feel that you know these subjects very well
 acchhee baat he ki sabhi adhyyon ko binduvaar tareeke se likhaa gaya jise samajhnaa behad aasaan he
 This book will be useful for those who discuss politics and elections in Galli neighborhood and those who know national politics closely
 kalam puure bharat main ghumkar kareeb 1 karod 70 lakh yuvaaon se mil chuke hai
 The book 'governance for Growth in India' has been written by Kalam keeping in mind the development and governance of India in a visionary and practical tone
 unhen yakeen he ki yuva peedi hamaare maujuuda raajnneetik system ko badal sakati he
 If the child is taught to remain corruption free from home, then nothing can stop India from becoming a corruption free country
 unhone janpratinidhiyon ko creative leadership kaa concept apnaane ko kaha he
 Creative and Passionate leadership must also include bold decisions with innovative ideas
 iskaa ek acha or taaja tareen udhaaharan dete hue unhone i shridharan or vikram sarabhai jaise charchit logon ke karnaamon kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 Kalam has insisted on instilling leadership qualities in children since childhood
 desh ko badalane ke liye sanitific approach rakhane vaale kalam ne is kitaab main sieji kii bhi khulkar tarif kii he
 He believes that this constitutional body has given very good reviews in different areas in the last few years
 lekin ye rivyuu us samay aae, jab un kshetron main sudhaar kii koi gunjaaish nahin rah gai thi
 The CAG should join the system and give its reviews from time to time, so that it can work effectively
 desh ke bajet kaa 20 fisadi hissaa raksha bajet par kharch hota he
 Therefore, transparency should also be brought in the defense mission
 kalam ne suzav die hai ki dephence acanut department kii audit team or takneekee team ko aapas main milakar kaam karnaa chahie
 He has also made several suggestions to the Election Commission to increase the role of youth in politics
 partiyaan apane ghoshnaa patr main vikaas kii yojanaon ko shaamil kar development ghoshnaa patr banaaen
 The Election Commission should ensure that the party fulfills all the promises of the party manifesto within a stipulated time
 isse yuva unako unke kaam ke aadhaar par chunenge or aane vaale samay main wo bhi raajnneeti main aana chahenge
 Why read this book, if you want to make something smaller than your level for the country, then definitely read it
 system ko badalane kii sakaaratmak soch ko nai urja milegi
 Do you think that whatever you do, the system is not going to change, yet once you dare read it completely
 meri raay main to har janpratinidhi ko bhi yah kitaab padhani chahie
 Why not read this book if you are not interested in doing anything special for the country, do not bother if you do not connect yourself with politics and system
 kalam ne sunaaya kissakitab main kalam ne apane daur ke kai achche netritv ke udhaaharan bhi pesh kiye hai
 Kalam mentions an incident during the tenure of Narasimha Rao's government
 ek din kalam ke paas narsimha raav kaa phone aayaa
 He asked Kalam to prepare for the nuclear test with his team
 us samay raav kii sarkaar jane vaali thi or atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar aane vaali thi
 Kalam wrote that Rao called him and Vajpayee and asked him to give all the details of the nuclear test in front of him so that the incoming government could be given a smooth takeover
 kalam us samay us ghatana ke gavaah the, jab raajnneeti ko bhulaakar do netaa sirf desh ke liye soch rahe the
 He has also written that both Vajpayee and Rao were courageous leaders who had the power to take big decisions for the country
 saahas par kalam ne ek or ghatana kaa zikr kiya he
 He wrote that once he was flying a SU-30 MKI air craft
 jaise hi air craft neeche utraa, kai noujvaan or media ke log unase baaten karne lage
 One said that at the age of 74, you did not fear running a supersonic fighter aircraft
 is par kalam kaa jawaab tha, 40 minute kii flite ke dauraan main yantron ko control karne main vyast rahaa or is dauraan maine dar ko apane andar aane kaa samay hi nahin diya
 In the last part of this book, Kalam has written that all the youth should write their goals on one page and that page should prove to be one page to bring about a good change in the society
 phir badlaav chaahe garibi kam karne kaa ho, kisi scientific khoj kaa ho yaa phir anyaay ke khilaaf ladaai kaa ho

 a post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) on Dec 7, 2016 at 10:30pm PST Pakistan's Supreme Court took a tough stand while hearing the crisis leaders including Zardari and asked the government to talk to the PM to clear the stand in the case
 iske saath hi court ne piem yusuf raja gilaani ko avmaananaa kaa notice jari kar 19 janvari ko court main pesh hone kaa aadesh diya he
 The court gave contempt notice to Gilani after the Attorney General told the court that he had not been given any instructions from the government as to what he should say in the court
 gauratlab he ki pareshaaniyon main ghiri sarkaar ne samarthan ke liye sansad kaa ruukh kiya he
 The Supreme Court of India is hearing the case of corruption on Zardari
 pakistan main pichley saal ashankit sainya vidroh ko rokane ke liye america se madad maangane sambandhi rahasyamay memo kii jaanch ke liye sheersh adaalat dwaara gathit ek nyaayik ayog aaj bhi jari he
 The National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, is understood to be voting today on a resolution seeking approval and support on efforts by political leadership to strengthen democracy
 ek ore jahaan sansad is prastaav par vichaar karegi vahiin duusari ore supreme court kii 17 sadasyeey peeth rasookh vaale logon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamalon ko phir se kholane sambandhi ek pariwaad par sunwaayee kar rahi he
 In 2007, cases of corruption against influential people were closed by the then military ruler Pervez Musharraf under the National Reconciliation Consent Ordinance (NRO)
 pakistani mul ke america udyogpati mansoor ijaaj ne is memo ko saarvajanik kar raajnneetik halkon main tufaan khadaa kar diya
 Ijaz did not appear before the Commission today to testify and has asked for time till January 25
 bataa den ki pichley saptaah sheersh adaalat ne chetavanee di thi ki agar sarkaar enarao mudde par uske aadesh kii avagya karti rahegi to pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani or raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sakati he
 The court had said that Gilani cannot be an honest person due to not honoring the oath taken while assuming office
 sheersh adaalat ne yah bhi chetavanee di thi ki agar raashtrapati apane pad sambandhi shapath kaa ulanghan karte hai to unako bhi isi nattejey kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Amid mounting pressure from the judiciary, the government is trying to avoid a confrontation with the powerful military in the memo
 sheersh adaalat ne sena pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani kaa maamle kii swatantra jaanch karaane sambandhi anurodh sweekaar kar liya he or sarkaar kii yah daleel thukraa di ki yah jaanch ek sansadeey panel dwaara karai jaani chahie
 The confrontation between the government and the army peaked last week when Prime Minister Gilani said that the army and intelligence chiefs acted in an 'unconstitutional and illegal' way by filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court on the memo issue without the government's approval

 aisa ho saktaa he ki 3232 trakon ke bare main jaankaree na mili yaa koi itani badi sankhya main trakon ke bare main galat jaankaree sarkari register main bhar de
 In Punjab, the CAG has given a report which was tabled in the Assembly in the budget session of March

 How to find those 3000 trucks
 kya unka vigyaapan nikaala jaae, 12000 karod ke stock kaa hisaab nahin mil rahaa he, kya ye hisaab kitaab kaa purana jhamela he yaa koi ghotaalaa he
 The Government of India, through the Reserve Bank of India, gives money to Punjab to purchase paddy and wheat
 rigerv bank se paisa pahunchataa he bhartiya state bank sahit 30 bainkon ke paas
 Now the Punjab Government for Food Corporation of India, or FCI, starts the process of purchasing food grains
 paisa milte hi punjab sarkaar aadhati se kahati he ki wo kisaanon se gehun kharide
 The agent used to tell the government through the mandis that he has bought so much
 sarkaar bank ko bataati he ki falaan mandi main itane lakh ton genhu kii kharid ho gai he
 In return, the bank immediately gives money to the state government
 rajya sarkaar 48 ghante ke bheetar aadhati ke khate main paisa bhej detii he, taaki kisaanon ko jaldi paisa mil sake
 However, at this point the government can also consider sending money directly to the farmers' account
 kair
 
 
 When the agent procures, the agencies bring trucks to take it to the warehouse
 iske liye punjab main paanch chah agenciyaan hai
 These trucks reach the warehouse with grain and there is a receipt that how much goods were brought and from which trucks
 mandi main kitna kharida gaya or godaam main kitna pahunchaa, iskaa alag-alag data rakhaa jaataa he
 These are then matched
 yahi milan hua to pataa chalaa ki jitna anaaj mandi main kharida gaya utana to godaam main pahunchaa hi nahin
 i told you this thick so that you can understand the process
 'iconomik times' ne to is par kai khabaren chhaapi hai
 According to him, the group of 30 banks associated with procurement in Punjab is not getting the stock of 12,000 crore stock
 khabar ai ki bainkon ne pataa chalate hi is sijan main kareed ke baad bhugtan roak diya
 Punjab says that the money received from the Center to buy food grains has not been misused anywhere
 ye anaaj central pool main jaataa he yani bhartiya khaadya nigam ko de diya jaataa he or baqayda iskaa ricard rakhaa jaataa he
 If this is the case then why did the Reserve Bank of India need to worry
 kai baar epasiai bhi sidhe mandi se anaaj uthaakar apane trakon se duusare rajyon main bhijwa detii he
 Therefore, FCI should also be told that the truck which is not getting the accounts of Rs 12000 crore wheat, took its truck somewhere
 gaye bhi yaa nahin gaye
 There is no trace of more than 3000 trucks
 is masale ko lekar mukhyamantri badal ne pradhanmantri se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 But the banks are upset where so much money went
 agar sarkaar ke godaam main stock nahin he to kahaan gaya
 Then who was given the money
 agar hisaab nahin milegaa to bank apane khate main itani badi rakam ko kaise dikhaayenge
 According to the 'economic Times', banks asked Punjab to tell the entire plan how you will pay this money and give the account of the stock because if this calculation is not found then the banks will have to declare a bad loan of 1800 to 3000 crores
 lihaaza abhi to ve ek vijay maalya ko nahin pakad paa rahe hai
 Such a large amount has to be either forgotten or one has to take a car in search of many anonymous, unknown Mallyas
 'iconomik times' main 19 april ko sangeeta mehta or saloni shukla kii report he, bhartiya rigerv bank ne bainkon se kaha he ki unhone punjab ko jo karja diya he uskaa ek bada hissaa non parforming asset ho saktaa he
 Banks were given a loan of Rs 12000 crore to buy food grains to the Punjab government
 punjab sarkaar kahati he ki in paison se desh ke liye anaaj hi kharide gaye hai
 Union Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha has also admitted that there is a big difference between what is in stock in the warehouse and what it should be
 akhbaar ke anusaar sinha ne vistaar se jawaab nahin diya ki kya aisa anya rajyon main bhi ho saktaa he
 He said that is why we need to find a comprehensive solution
 iske kaaran kisaanon ke bhugtan main deree hoti ja rahi he
 The crisis has deepened in the mandis surrounding Sangrur district
 hamane sangrur kii teen mandiyon kaa haal pataa kiya
 Sangrur, Dhuri and Lehra
 yahaan achhatiyon or kisaanon ne bataaya ki gehun bechney ke do hafte hone ko aae magar paise nahin mili hai
 Money was usually received within 24 to 48 hours
 sangrur ke aasapaas 16 mandiyaan hai
 This is the story everywhere
 sangrur kii mandi ke ek aadhati ne phone par bataaya ki 11 tarikh kii unki boli lagi thi magar 20 april yani buudhvaar tak pement nahin mili he
 He has purchased 40,000 wheat sacks from 200 farmers
 mandi board ko teen karod kaa bill bhej bhi diya he magar paisa aayaa hi nahin to kisaan ko kahaan se den
 After talking to several adhatiyas, it was found that about 12 lakh sacks are lying in 16 mandis of Sangrur and their money has not arrived kisaanon ke saath mandiyon main kaam karne vaale mazdooron ko bhi paise nahin mil rahe hai
 They also have money left for november-december
 ek bori uthaane ke 1 rupee 58 paise kaa rate he
 One rupee has been received from the last time but 58 paise has not been received on every sack
 is kaaran gehun uthaane aa rahi agenciyon ke pradarshan main susti dikh rahi he
 In Sangrur itself, about four thousand migrants and local laborers are said to be affected by it
 kai kisaan to chale gaye magar ab bhi badi sankhya main kisaan mandiyon main hi deraa daale hue hai ki paisa aayega to ghar jaayenge
 Farmers also have to pay from tractor to wheat cutting machine carbine
 skool kii fees se lekar rashan kaa udhaar alag
 Farmers also have to pay the installments of banks
 ek-ek kisaan ke teen se chaar lakh rupee achhatiyon ke paas he or achhatiyon ke karodon rupee sarkaar ke paas bakaayaa hai
 The comments hamane mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke grih zile muktsar kii mandi kaa bhi haal pataa kiya
 This is Giddarbah Mandi
 yahaan se sarkaar 7 lakh 90 hazaar boriyon uthaakar godaamon main le gayi phir bhi kisaanon ko abhi tak bhugtan nahin hua he iskaa hisaab lagaayenge to kareeb 59 karod ke aasapaas baithegaa
 85,000 sacks are lying in Mandi itself
 muktsar main kareeb 56 mandiyaan hai
 There are four large mandis and around 52 small and medium mandis
 har mandi kii kamobesh yahi kahani he
 Thousands of farmers have been waiting for money for two weeks
 yahaan bhi achhatiyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii taraf se paise nahin aa rahe hai
 In the 'times of India' of 20 April, Rohan Dua wrote that the Punjab government has not yet recovered Rs 1300 crore from rice mills
 sieji kii report main kaha gaya he ki jalandhar, ludhiana, sangrur, mohali or fatehgarh sahit kai milon se pataa chalaa he ki jo stock he or unke badale bainkon se jo paisa liya gaya he usamen kaaphi antar he
 According to the CAG, money was given to benefit Miles, but the goods are not known
 punjab ke kisaan sankat main hai
 The Indian Express has reported that now half of the people in Punjab have started committing suicide
 un 3000 trakon kaa kaisaa pataa lagaaya jaae
 Should their advertisement be removed, the stock of 12000 crores is not being accounted for, is it an old mess of the book or is it a scam
 sarkaar bank ko bataati he ki falaan mandi main itane lakh ton genhu kii kharid ho gai he
 In return, the bank immediately gives money to the state government
 rajya sarkaar 48 ghante ke bheetar aadhati ke khate main paisa bhej detii he, taaki kisaanon ko jaldi paisa mil sake
 However, at this point the government can also consider sending money directly to the farmers' account

 yahi milan hua to pataa chalaa ki jitna anaaj mandi main kharida gaya utana to godaam main pahunchaa hi nahin
 i told you this thick so that you can understand the process
 'iconomik times' ne to is par kai khabaren chhaapi hai
 According to him, the group of 30 banks associated with procurement in Punjab is not getting the stock of 12,000 crore stock
 khabar ai ki bainkon ne pataa chalate hi is sijan main kareed ke baad bhugtan roak diya
 Punjab says that the money received from the Center to buy food grains has not been misused anywhere
 ye anaaj central pool main jaataa he yani bhartiya khaadya nigam ko de diya jaataa he or baqayda iskaa ricard rakhaa jaataa he
 If this is the case then why did the Reserve Bank of India need to worry
 kai baar epasiai bhi sidhe mandi se anaaj uthaakar apane trakon se duusare rajyon main bhijwa detii he
 Therefore, FCI should also be told that the truck which is not getting the accounts of Rs 12000 crore wheat, took its truck somewhere
 gaye bhi yaa nahin gaye
 There is no trace of more than 3000 trucks
 is masale ko lekar mukhyamantri badal ne pradhanmantri se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 But the banks are upset where so much money went
 agar sarkaar ke godaam main stock nahin he to kahaan gaya
 Then who was given the money
 agar hisaab nahin milegaa to bank apane khate main itani badi rakam ko kaise dikhaayenge
 According to the 'economic Times', banks asked Punjab to tell the entire plan how you will pay this money and give the account of the stock because if this calculation is not found then the banks will have to declare a bad loan of 1800 to 3000 crores
 lihaaza abhi to ve ek vijay maalya ko nahin pakad paa rahe hai
 Such a large amount has to be either forgotten or one has to take a car in search of many anonymous, unknown Mallyas
 'iconomik times' main 19 april ko sangeeta mehta or saloni shukla kii report he, bhartiya rigerv bank ne bainkon se kaha he ki unhone punjab ko jo karja diya he uskaa ek bada hissaa non parforming asset ho saktaa he

 punjab sarkaar kahati he ki in paison se desh ke liye anaaj hi kharide gaye hai
 Union Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha has also admitted that there is a big difference between what is in stock in the warehouse and what it should be

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) June 16, 2014 rahul gandhi ke namakan patr bharne par bijepi ne jahaan congress par tikhe waar kiya, vahiin congress ke varisht netaa ise bijepi kii ghabrahat bataa rahe hai
 According to the Congress, the BJP is upset with Rahul Gandhi's support in Gujarat
 ashok gahalot nerahul gandhidwara congress party ke adhyaksh pad ke namakan ke baad kaha kiraahul gandhike netritv main party aage badhegi
 Rahul has worked hard for the last several years to take the party forward
 gujarat main bhi jis tarahrahul gandhiko samarthan mil rahaa he, use saaf he ki gujarat main congress jeetegi
 Shivraj Patil said Kirahul Gandhi is contesting the election
 jo bhi chunaav ladane kii prakriya he, uske tahat namakan bharaa he
 The entire process will be followed
 jo bhi chunaav ladanaa chahta he lard saktaa he
 On the bjp's accusations of dynasty, Shivraj Patil says that he does not see the power in these allegations of BJP
 kyonki congress main ek chunavi prakriya he
 Under this, he is contesting elections
 jahaan tak nai timrahulke netritv main banane kii baat he
 Whenever a new president is formed, he or she forms their own team
 team main senior netaaon or yuva netaaon par shivaraj ne kaha ki swabhaavik taur se jo nae log hote hai, junior log hote hai, unako mauka miltaa he or senior log thodaa peeche hote hai
 But Rahul and Gandhi will take a mixture of both experience and youth
 shila dikshit ne kaha kiraahul gandhi pehle saaf kiya he ki puraane or yuva netaa, in donon kii unako jarurat he or donon ko hi party main saath lekar chalenge
 The experience of older people and the enthusiasm of younger leaders will help in taking the party forward
 jahaan takaraahul gandhike kaam karne kaa sawaal he, to unamem apane pitarahul gandhiore daadi indira gandhi va apni maa sonia gandhi ke kaam karne kii jhalak he
 Together they have also worked in the party for many years
 ye tamaam chijen party ko majboot karne main sahaayak hongi
 Taking a dig at the BJP, young leaders Sachin Pilot and Rajeev Shukla said that the Congress does not interfere in who becomes the President of the BJP and how he works
 aise main bijepi yaa pradhanmantri narendra modi korahul gandhike adhyaksh banane ko lekar kyon chintaa sata rahi he
 Why BJP is in trouble darasal, gujarat memrahul gandhiko baari samarthan milanaa hi unki pareshaani kaa kaaran ban gaya he
 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad also said that the party will grow further with Kirahul Gandhi becoming president
 jahaan tak nae netaa or puraane netaaon kii baat he, to sab mil kar party ko or majboot karenge
 Rahul Gandhi will take all the people along
 in dinon tivi ke dance reality sho dance diwane ko jaj kar raheen maadhuri dikshit nene ne is sho par personal life se judaa apana ek dard bayaan kiya he
 Who said that Sanjee, who was not the wife of cancer, what will happen to Madhuri, Madhuri says that sometimes even her two sons do not give importance to her
 ek bayaan ke mutabik, 'dance diwane' sho ke contestant main se ek kishan ne apni parformens apni maa ko samarpit karte hue logon kii ankhon main aansu laa die
 Then after this presentation, Kishan said, 'I regret ignoring my mother's phone and not giving importance to them
 'sidhi baat main boleen maadhuri dikshit- mere bachche meri filmein nahin dekhte, na hi fain hanmadhuri ne apane jawaab main kaha, 'kabhi-kabhi mere bete bhi mujhe ahmiyat nahin dete hai or mujhe us vakt bura lagata he jab main unhen baar-baar bulaati rahati hum lekin main kuch nahin kar sakati
 Madhuri further said that the thing is that every mother in this world is very protective about her children
 'unhone kaha, 'jab main choti thi to main bhi yahi kiya karti thi lekin ab main maa hum to mujhe pataa he ki ye kaisaa lagata he
 ' pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani kii tippanee ko ashobhaneey or durbhagyapurna qaraar diya
 Advani called the UPA-2 government illegitimate
 pradhanmantri se sansad bhawan parisar main jab samvaadadaataaon ne loksabhaa main adwani kii tippanee par pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone kaha, ‘tippanee ashobhaneey or durbhagyapurna he
 Advani's remarks created a ruckus in the lower house and the BJP leader had to withdraw his remarks following stiff resistance from the ruling party
 adwani ne haalanki baad main spashtikaran diya ki vah 2008 main hue vishwaas mat kii baat kar rahe the, jisamen sarkaar bachaane ke liye karodon rupaye kharch kiye gayi the
 UK doctors are advising patients to send information about symptoms of the disease by e-mail rather than visiting them directly
 yah britain ke ‘neshnal health sarvice’ se har saal kareeb ek arab pound bachaane kii muhim kaa hissaa he
 According to the report of Daily Express, the doctors will see the e-mail message sent by the patients in free time or at the end of the day
 hriday kii bimariyon, madhumeh or phenfdon se sambandhit bimariyon se jujh rahe logon ko apana raktchaap jaanch kar use bhi bhejne ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 The project has taken around 6,000 patients suffering from long-term illnesses in Filhal Cornwell, Kent and East London
 sabhi marijon ko electranik mashine di gayi hai jinase ve oparation se pehle hone vaale sabhi jaanch kar saken iskaa parinaam saal ke ant main prakashit kiya jayega
 In this plan, the doctor will call the patient for the operation only if he is satisfied with the report
 agar oparation kii jarurat nahin hogi to doctor use jaruri dawaaen or salaah i-mail ke jariye hi bataa degaa
 England's wicketkeeper batsman Matt Prior made it clear after four years that he did not sack Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar during the Trentbridge Test in the 2007 series
 reporton main praayar par aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki unhone tendulkar se kaha tha, main porsh chalaata hum, tum koun si car chalaate ho
 Prior now dismissed these reports as incorrect
 unhone kaha, mujh par un chizon ke liye bhi aarope lagaae jate hai, jo maine nahin kiye
 Such as throwing jelly bean on the pitch and making nonsensical remarks against Sachin Tendulkar about a Porsche car
 yah puri tarah se bakawaas he
 Prior to Zaheer Khan coming to bat in the Trentbridge Test match, Prior was accused of throwing jelly bean on the pitch
 centre sarkaar ne general varg ke aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa faisla kiya he
 The government may be claiming to uplift the economically weaker sections of the general category by giving them reservation, but their participation has not increased much with the reservation given to Dalits earlier
 kam se kam kuch aankade yahi bataate hai
 It is said that by providing reservation to Dalits, they get more opportunities in government jobs and their participation is much higher
 haalanki, jamini str par hakeekat alag he
 Questions are arising whether it is true that backward people are filled with reservation? Is it true that Dalits are filled only by reservation? Recently, an English newspaper got the answers to these questions in the information received under Right to Information
 darasal, artiai main mili jaankaree saamaajik nyaay ke liye aarakshan ke siddhant se kaaphi alag he
 See what the figures say
 
 
 desh ke kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main aarakshan kii sachai?bataa den ki desh main kul 40 kendriya vishvavidhyalay hai, jisamen kul padhaane vaale 11486 hai or gaiyr shikshan karmchaaree 5835 hai
 Also, there are 1125 professors in these 40 Central Universities and among them 39 Dalit Professors
 47 fisadi (15 fisadi hone chahie the), adivaciprofessor 6 yani 0
 7 percent (7
 5 fisadi hone chahie the) or pichde professor 0 (27 fisadi hone chahie the) or savarna professor 1071 yani 95
 2 percent (maximum can be 50 percent)
 kya he associat professor kaa haal?agar associat professor kii baat karen to 40 kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main associat professor kii haalat or bhi chaunkaane vaali he
 In fact, there are a total of 2620 associate professors in 40 institutes
 isamen 130 yani 4
 96 per cent Dalit professors (should have been a minimum of 393), 34 i
e
 1
 3 fisadiadivasee professor (nunatam 197 honi chahie the) or 3434 yani 92
 9% of Savarnas are professors (the maximum could be 50%)
 vahiin puure desh main ek bhi pichde varg kaa associat professor nahin he
 What is the status of Assistant Professor? There are 7741 Assistant Professors in 40 Central Universities of the country
 isamen 931 yani 12
 2% Dalit Professor (minimum required 1161 posts), 423 i
e

 46 fisadi adivasee professor (nunatam chahie 581 pad), 1113 yani 14
 38 percent backward class professor (minimum required 2090 posts), 5130 i
e
 66
 27 fisadi savarna professor (adhiktam chahie 3870 pad) hai
 What is the condition of central jobs? - Railway has a total of 16381 posts, of which 1319 (8
 05%) pichde or 11273 (68
 72%) are upper caste employees
 - 71 vibhaagon main kul 343777 pad hai, jisamen 51384 (14
 94%) backward and 216408 (62
 95%) savarna karmchaaree hai
 - The Ministry of Human Resource Development has a total of 665 posts, of which 56 (8
 42%) pichde or 440 (66
 17%) are upper caste employees
 - cabinet sachivalay main kul 162 pad hai, jisamen 15 (9
 26%) backward and 130 (80
 25%) savarna karmchaaree hai
 - The President's Secretariat has a total of 130 posts, including 10 (7
 69%) pichde or 97 (74
 62%) are upper caste employees
 is jaankaree ke anusaar, savarnon ke adhiktam 50 fisad hone kaa sara hisaab ulataa ho jaataa he or pichhadon ke nunatam 27
 Even the calculation of 5 percent does not fit
 vahiin, 1 april 2018 tak bharat ke kisi bhi kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke kisi bhi vibhaag main 28 saal ke aarakshan ke baadabhi pichhadi jati kaa ek bhi professor or pichde varg kaa associat professor nahin tha
 At the same time, Assistant Professor is only half of the reserved seat
 aankadon se pataa chalata he ki niyamon ke anusaar tay padon par hi arakshit ummidavaaron kii niyukti nahin ho pai he or general varg ke ummidavaaron ko niyukti adhiktam seemaa se bhi zyada he
 Umpire Sanjay Hazare took to Twitter after the match played between Delhi Daredevils and Rajasthan Royals in IPL-7
 aap bhi soch rahe honge ki aakhir aisa kya ho gaya ki sanjay hajaare ko twitor par trend karne lage
 Kevin Pietersen's decision to runout made Hazare quite famous

 It was the 7th over of the Delhi Daredevils' innings, with Kevin Pietersen scoring 2 runs

 Umpire Sanjay Hazare, standing at square leg, called him a notout

 But Sanjay Hazare, relying on his eyes, called Peterson a notout
 haalanki riple main saaf dikh rahaa tha ki petersan krij tak nahin pahunch paae the
 Delhi captain Pietersen could not take much advantage of this wrong decision and was dismissed for 14 runs
 iske baad kya tha twitor par sanjay hajaare ke is faisle par khub chutkiyaan lee gayi
 Someone wrote a 2-minute silence for umpiring Sanjay Hazare, and someone tweeted sarcastically that someone should tell Sanjay Hazare that it is IPL and there is a third umpire

 shiv kii nagari kaashi main mahadev saakshaat vaas karte hai
 The two temples of Baba Vishwanath are very special here
 pehla vishwanath mandir jo 12 jyotirlingon main nauvaan sthaan rakhata he, vahiin doosraa jise nayaa vishwanath mandir kaha jaataa he
 This temple is located in the premises of Kashi University
 kaashi nagari patit paavani ganga ke tat par basii
 It is also said that the city of Kashi is situated on the trident of Devadidev Mahadev
 dharmagranthon or puraanon main jise moksh kii nagari kaha gaya he jo anantkaal se baba vishwanath ke bhakton ke jayakaaron se goonjati aayi he, shiv bhakton kii wo manzil he jo sadiyon se yahaan moksh kii talash main aate rahe hai
 On this journey of Kashi, we will show you two such forms of Mahadev, which are called as Baba Vishwanath
 aap soch rahe honge ki ek hi nagari main bhole ke do rup wo bhi ek hi naam se kaise? varanasi ke kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main virajman baba vishwanath kii mahima or unke mahatv ke bare main bhi ham aapako bataaenge
 Shrikant Mishra, the architect of the Kashi Vishwanath temple, says that Kashi is the ninth place of the 12 Jyotirlingas
 manyata he ki agar koi bhakt baba vishwanath ke darbar main hajiri lagaataa he to use janm-janmaantar ke chakra se mukti mil jaati he
 Baba's blessings open the door to salvation for his devotees
 aisi manyata he ki ek bhakt ko bhagwaan shiv ne sapane main darshan dekar kaha tha ki ganga snaan ke baad use do shivlinga milenge or jab wo un donon shivlingon ko jodakar unhen sthapit karegaa to shiv or shakti ke divya shivlinga kii sthapana hogi or tabhi se bhagwaan shiv yahaan maa parvati ke saath virajman hai
 According to another belief, Maa Bhagwati herself installed Mahadev here
 baba vishwanath ke mandir main tadake subah kii mangala aarti ke saath puure din main chaar baar aarti hoti he
 It is believed that the virtue of water offered on Monday is more
 khaastaur par sawan ke somvaar main yahaan jalabhishek karne kaa apana ek alag hi mahatv he
 Shrikant Mishra says that every day of the spring is holy and during this time Baba is pleased by offering water
 kaashi ke kan-kan main chamatkaar kii kahaniyaan bhari padi hai, lekin baba vishwanath ke is dham main aakar bhakton kii sabhi muraadein puri ho jaati hai auki jivan dhanya ho jaataa he
 On one hand, there is the privilege of seeing the great and very rare form of Shiva, while bathing in the Ganges, all sins are washed away
 kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay parisar main maujuud nae kaashi vishwanath mandir kehane ko nayaa he, lekin is mandir kaa bhi mahatv utana hi he jitna puraane kaashi vishwanath kaa
 It is said that whoever comes here and visits Bhole Bhandari, who gets Rudrabhisheka gets all wishes
 uske liye moksh ke dwaar khul jate hai
 Here the gods reside and the torrent of the Ganges flows, it is called Paramatirtha Varanasi
 yahaan aane bhar se hi bhakton kii pidaa dur ho jaati he
 Body and mind get unlimited peace

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday assured Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that the pending Land Acquisition Bill would be introduced in the next session of Parliament
 singh ne gandhi ko yah aashwaasan tab diya jab yuva netaa uttar pradesh ke congress netaaon or kisaanon ke pratinidhimandal ke saath pradhanmantri se milane aaye the
 These farmers had recently protested against forcibly seizing their land in Aligarh and adjoining areas 
 gandhi ne kaha, ‘bhoomi adhigrahan ek behad mahatvapurn mudda he
 What happened in Aligarh was unfair
 hamen us par gaur karne kii jarurat he
 Asked about the pending Land Acquisition Bill, Gandhi said, "I am aware of it
" ’bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon 1994 main badlaav karne ke prastaav vaale is sanshodhan vidheyak 2007 ko samprag kii pramukh ghatak trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee ke purajor virodh ke chalate rokkar rakhaa gaya he
 The bill proposes to redefine 'public purpose' as land to be acquired for defense, infrastructure or any project useful to the general public
 vidheyak kahata he ki jis adhigrahan main vyapak paimaane par visthaapan hone vaala ho, aise maamle main uske saamaajik prabhaav kaa akalan kiya janaa chaiye
 The delegation to meet the Prime Minister included Rahul Gandhi, Digvijay Singh, Uttar Pradesh Congress President Rita Bahuguna Joshi, State Congress Legislature Party leader Pramod Tiwari and some farmers
 pratinidhimandal ne apni maangon ko lekar ek gyaapan bhi pradhanmantri ko saunpa
 The memorandum states that the Land Acquisition Act of 1984 is still in force in the country
 aapke netritv main sarkaar ne isamen badlaav laane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ab tak isamen safalataa nahin mili he
 Almost all the states of the country are opposed to the old Land Acquisition Act
 yah bahut hi purana kanoon he or aaj kii arthvyavastha ke sandarbh main yah avyavhaarik ban gaya he
 Asked whether the government will bring the bill to amend the Land Acquisition Act in the next session of Parliament, Digvijay Singh said, "we have got this assurance
" pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah is vidheyak ko jitna jald sambhav ho paarit karaane kaa prayaas karenge
 Asked about the party's view of the proposed Parliament siege of farmers and some political parties, Digvijay Singh said that there is no point in it
 maine ajit singh se baatcheet kii thi or unhone bataaya ki is andolan main hissaa lene kaa koi tuk nahin banataa he
 He said that if there is to be an agitation then there is a siege of the state assembly
 adhikariyon ne kaha he ki dhuen or kohre ke mishran se janma jaanaleva smog phir se rus kii rajdhani moscow main laut aayaa he
 This smog has killed many people in Moscow
 mausam kii nigaraanee karne vaale masekomaniaring ke alexi popicove ne kaha ki ravivaar kii shuruuaat main vaataavaran main carbon monoksaide kaa str saamaanya se paanch guna adhik tha
 He said that most of the smog was dispersed due to the winds on Monday
 wanon main aag lagane ke kaaran uthi dhuen kii kaali chadar ne is hafte kii shuruuaat main masco ko apane ghere main le liya tha
 Due to this the number of dead had doubled and many aircraft did not fly from the airports
 apaat adhikariyon ne kaha ki masco ke baahar dawanal ke kaaran ravivaar kii shuruuaat main mritkon kii sankhya 16 ho gayi thi
 This time of the season in Russia it is getting very hot
 dilli ke sarkari skulon main padhane vaale 372 bacchon ne jeii (mens) qualifi kiya he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has congratulated the children on the news of qualifying children for JEE
 tyagaraj stadium main mangalvaar ko yojit ek kaarykram main kejariwal ne kaha, hamen aap sab par garv he
 Congratulations to all of you
 aap sabko aashirwad
 Government school children have developed confidence that we are not less than anyone
 aapke parents, teachers or shiksha vibhaag ke sabhi adhikariyon- karmchaariyon ko badhai, jinaki mehnat kii badaulat ye sambhav hua he
 The Chief Minister said that the public did not want to teach their children in government schools
 lekin pichley do saal ke bheetar dilli ke sarkari skulon main jo shikshakranti hui he, jo mehnat hui he, aap jaise bachche usee kaa output hai
 You have qualified JEE (mains) and you are becoming an example for the children to come
 kejariwal ne bacchon se kii apiservind kejariwal ne in bacchon se ek apil karte hue kaha, jab ejeeniyar banakar niklo, tab is desh ko mat bhul janaa
 Put a little money in your earnings and a little part of your life, in the name of this country
 jaise aap logon ko is desh ne padhaayaa, vaise aap logon kii kamai se duusare bachche bhi padhein or ye desh aage badhata rahe
 He said, the poorest of the poor have money in your education
 aap sabane sarkari skulon main padhai kii he
 The poorest of the poor pay taxes to run these schools
 ab aap sarkari ejineering coleje main jaaenge, vahaan bhi garib se garib aadmi ke tex se diye hue paison se aapaki padhai hogi
 So do not forget this country after becoming an engineer
 dilli ke up-mukhyamantri or shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne in bacchon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, aap sab log hamaare brands ambesder hai
 Wherever you go, you will be flagging the government schools of Delhi
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki aap jin skulon se padhakar nikle hai, vahaan or bhi honhaar bachche hai
 All the government schools in Delhi have promising children
 unke kariyar ko sanvaarane ke liye, unke kariyar ko pankh lagane ke liye aage aaen
 You give us input as to what the government should do to improve the career ahead of children of 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th
 dilli se baahar padhane vaale bacchon ko bhi milegaa ajukeshan guarantee lone skim kaa phaaydadilli ke sarkari skulon main padhakar jeii (mens) qualifi karne vaale 372 bacchon ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar kii ajukeshan guarantee lone skim kaa phayda dilli se baahar padhane vaale bacchon ko bhi milanaa chahie
 The department should make necessary arrangements for this
 unhone kaha, agar koi baccha apni fees nahin de saktaa, is vajah se usko hair ajukeshan na mili, ye galat baat he
 But when the parents go to a bank to take an education loan, the bank says to take some mortgage
 ab girvee rakhane ke liye kuch hota to wo garib kyon hota
 That is why after joining the government, we started a scheme that you do not need to pledge anything for education loan
 sarkari aapaki guarantee degi
 You will get a loan of up to Rs 10 lakh for higher education
 ab tak ye keval dilli ke collejes ke liye tha
 But now if children studying from Delhi get admission in any college of the world, then they should get the benefit of this scheme
 mukhyamantri ne ye bhi kaha ki jis tarah skool infrastracchar ko sudhaarney ke liye, skulon main naye kamare banavaane ke liye yuddh str par kaam hua he, usee tarah teachers kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye hamen yuddh str par kaam karnaa he

 His name is in the Exit Control List (ECL), which includes the names of those desired by various law enforcement agencies

 Fasih Bukhari, chairman of the National Investigation Bureau (NAB), an independent investigative agency, told India Today that in April 2011, the Prime Minister's name was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs for inclusion in the ECL

 Ashraf, who was the Energy Minister from March 2008 to February 2011, approved the establishment of 19 such plants with a combined generation capacity of 2,734 MW
 sarkaar ne nijee rental bijli companiyon ko bank se karj lekar 21
 8 billion Pakistani rupees were given, but no plant could work to its full potential
 unhone mahaj 120 megawatt bijli kaa hi utpaadan kiya
 Pakistan has a daily power requirement of 14,000–15,000 MW but its plants produce only 8,000–9,000 MW of electricity per day
 urja mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya ki desh kii bijli kii maang kuch varshon main 22,000 megawatt tak bad sakati he
 The allegations of bribery were leveled against Prime Minister Ashraf by a member of the PML (Q), a coalition partner of the Pakistan People's Party, and former Housing Minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat and Leader of the Opposition Khwaja Asif

 '' doshi paae jane par ashraf ko neshnal assembly ke liye ayogy tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Following the Supreme Court's decision, the National Accountability Bureau has started an investigation against Ashraf
 court ke faisle main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki nijee rental plant se pehle tak bijli utpaadan pranali paryaapt rup se sakasham thi
 But instead of taking remedial steps like increasing the power generation capacity of existing dams, the establishment of a private rental plant for billions of rupees
 kharch kiye gaye jo puri tarah se naakaam sabit hue
 Now all the doubts are almost over and the matter is just that when will the Prime Minister leave

 After Gujarat, now even before Kejriwal's rally in Kashi, the demand for broom here has suddenly increased

 According to the traders, orders of 60 thousand rupees have been received for preparing the broom before Kejriwal's rally
 yahi vajah he ki vyapaariyon ne bade paimaane par jhaadu taiyaar karne kaa kaam bhi shuru kar diya he
 Due to increasing demand, seams are being sourced from Assam and Bengal, so that broom can be prepared on time

 On every Independence Day and Republic Day, many brands conduct special campaigns
 isse pataa chalata he ki vyavsaayik varg raashtra kii sthiti ke bare main kya soch rahaa he
 We have not yet seen what the brand-speak will be for Independence Day 2019, but based on recent trends it can be said that many brands will neither try to pursue the current political debates on patriotism, nor argue against them
 will do
 haalia chunaavon main deshbhakti kii raajnneeti behad chintajanak thi hi, use chunaav-baad ke siyaasi vimarsh main bhi khinch laayaa gaya he
 The BJP used images of the military and defense forces, asserting themselves as overbearing and totalitarian patriotism
 isane sawaal poochne waalon or asahmati jataane waalon ko 'raashtra-virdohi', na jane kya-kya kaha
 In its resistance, no other party introduced an alternative patriotism framework in politics, except those who debated the use of military images in political campaigns and casualties in 'surgical strikes' on terror camps across the border
 Questioned the official announcements of
 media brandon ne bhi chunavi abhiyaanon main 'tukade-tukade giroh', 'khan market gang' or 'jeenyu gang' jaisi oopaadhiyaan paane waalon kii deshbhakti par jaldi-jaldi apana paksh tay kar liya
 Thankfully, non-media brands stay away from this arena in this frightening environment
 koi bhi vyavsaayik brand adhinayakawadi hokar graahak shakti, udaarikaran or mahila shashaktikaran ke is nae yug main jivit nahin rah saktaa
 But do not the brands get any benefit from those who take a definite stand on socio-political issues? Recent research in more developed markets suggests that customers prefer brands that share their beliefs publicly
 bharat main aise koi brand he jo deshbhakti ke is swaroop ke khilaaf khadaa ho?sthapit brandon main se jisane deshbhakti kii nai raajnneeti ke khilaaf spasht rukh apanaaya, vah desh ke chaar bade vyapaarik samoohon main se ek tha
 On Independence Day last year, it launched a campaign demonstrating the sighting of the entire country through the eyes of truck drivers
 apni yatra main aae vibhinn sthanon, dhvaniyon or khaadya padaarthon ke bare main baat karne ke baad unamem se ek driver kahata he, ''ye jo ghar main baithe televijan main dikhaate hai, usase bilkul alag he meraa desh
 "this ad celebrates the diversified view of truck drivers and suggests we emulate their way of thinking
" bharat main badlaav dhire-dhire hota he, jab tak prachlit siyaasi vichaar ko dhakke se ulat dene vaala bindu na aa jaae
 Recently, a food delivery service publicly condemned a customer's request to send a Hindu delivery boy
 ek cab seva ne bhi aisa hi kiya tha
 Perhaps all this should give the millennial youth and the z generation brands the courage to say, "we disagree with such a thing and reject it
" ''bhartiya brand deshbhakti ko kaise vyakt karte hai, or inamen kaise badlaav aayaa he? kai brand ne desh kii uplabdhiyon kii prashansa, ateet or haal kii uplabdhiyon kaa samaran or mahaan vaigyanikon ke sammaan kaa surakshit, lokapriy or spasht tarika chunaa
 An evergreen theme that many brands have used to demonstrate their identity and love with the nation is to celebrate India's diversity

 After 1991, when the focus was shifted from building society to building the national economy, such campaigns did not run by the government
 'jai jawan' ke jariye sashastr balon ke prati sammaan kii abhivyakti ek anya lokapriy vishay he jo abhi bhi prachlit he or shaayad ekmaatr kshetra he jahaan rajnatik or brand kathy ek jaise hai
 After 1991, India became stronger for the next two decades and 'nation building' became a favorite subject

 Many old companies talked about their contribution from independence to the present, while new ones talked about their scope, scale and recent achievements
 bazaar ke har varg ke agua ne khud ko bharat kaa paryaay or yah bataane kii koshish kii ki bharat kii vividhta kii lau ko ooncha uthaane main unka yogadan he—'bharat kaa swaad', 'prayek bhartiya kaa banker', 'raashtra kaa itihaas hamaara itihaas he' or sabase lokapriy hua vigyaapan 'buland bharat kii buland tasviir
 'with generational changes in companies and communicators, how does young India think about such things? Are we seeing a change in his attitude towards patriotism, his role as an Indian citizen or the role of his brand in the manner of advertisements on Independence Day and Republic Day? a large part of these brands see these special days of the country as just marketing opportunity
 ek hotel room agrigater logon ko lambey swatantraaa diwas saptahanth kaa laabh uthaa kar desh ke vibhinn hisson kii yatra karne ke liye prerit karata he; ek or varg he jo in maukon par mega bikri kii ghoshnaa karata he, to ek or varg swatantraaa ke shabdic arthon main prayog karata he—jaise, 'katane-chhilane or khurduri dadhi se aazaadee' kaa vaada or tair phisalane kii chintaa se aazaadee aadi
 In recent times, there were messages circulating on whatsapp discussing indigenous and foreign brands, telling how heavy American and Chinese brands are occupying the Indian market and the government should not be helpful in advancing the Indian brands
 Has been kya 1991 kaa 'di bombai club' phir se kuch soch rahaa he? nahin, deshbhakti kaa vah jahaaj aage bad chukaa he
 There is a new theme around indigenous and foreigners, fair and equal competition to gain a fair share of their own market, and the work that China is doing — the development of local brands leaving behind global nobles

 The old notions of national branding being 'made in the country' are taking over as supply chains have gone global
 kisi asian website ko diya aadesh kisi america pate par pahunchataa he; use europe se bheja ja rahaa he, jabaki us par laga tag use 'maid in india' bataata he
