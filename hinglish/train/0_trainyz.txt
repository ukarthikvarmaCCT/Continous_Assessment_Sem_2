 The police is raiding in search of absconding miscreants
 upie-2 ke chaar saal puure hone ke maukey par bijepi ke netaaon sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ne jamkar sawaal uthaae
 He said that the government has failed on every front
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki sarkaar ko chaar saal puure karne kaa jashn manaane kaa haq nahin he
 As a rule, he should apologize to the people of the country
 aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 Arun Jaitley said that the achievement of the government is just that it has completed four years
 yah uplabdhi isliye bhi hasil hui ki sarkaar ne sibiai kaa jamkar durupyog kiya
 Had the government not misused the CBI, the SP and the BSP would not have always protected it
 is maukey par donon ne sidhe pradhanmantri par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Sushma said that Manmohan Singh could neither become a leader nor a Prime Minister, while Arun Jaitley said that the position of the Prime Minister has been left as a joke
 darasal, bijepi kaa aarope lagaati rahi he ki manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri hone ke baavjood sabhi nirnay adhyaksh sonia gandhi dwaara liye jate hai
 Sushma and Jaitley said that the government does not respect democratic institutions
 usne tamaam sansthaaon kaa kad giraaya he
 Only indulged in corruption
 saath hi sarkaar videshniti ke morche par bhi asafal rahi he
 Even a small country like Maldives shows us the eye
 chini ghuspaith mudde ko sulajhane main itnaa samay laga
 The BJP also attacked the government's economic policies
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki sirf vikaas dar arthvyavastha kaa paimaana nahin ho sakati

 5 karod ke project ruke hue hai
 Due to corruption, the public is facing inflation
 sushamaa ne aarope lagaaya ki ki piem daam badhaate hai or sonia kam karti hai
 Sushma said that UPA-2 failed politically
 sanghathan or upie sarkaar main talmail nahin he
 The leadership that the coalition needs has not been found
 tippaniyan Jaitley said that no one used the term policy paralysis even when the pace of the country was low
 aaj nitiyon main itnaa tehraav he ki har taraf sarkaar kii aalochana ho rahi he
 The bill did not come despite the movement on Lokpal
 aage kaha ki maayusi kaa aisa maahaul desh ne kabhi nahin dekha
 This government is full of arrogance
 agle saptaah ham sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf jail baro andolan karenge
 Sushma Swaraj said that the government has no right to celebrate the completion of four years
 kaayade se use desh ke logon se maafee maangani chahie
 Should be self-concerned
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii uplabdhi bas itani he ki usne chaar saal puure kar liye
 This achievement was also achieved because the government abused the CBI heavily
 agar sarkaar sibiai kaa durupyog na karti to sapa or basapa usko hameshaa na bachaate rahete
 On this occasion, both directly targeted the Prime Minister
 sushamaa ne kaha ki manmohan singh na netaa ban paae na pradhanmantri, jabaki arun jetali ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa ohada majaak kaa paatr banakar rah gaya he
 In fact, the BJP has been alleging that despite Manmohan Singh being the Prime Minister, all decisions are taken by President Sonia Gandhi
 sushamaa or jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar loktantric sansthaaon kaa sammaan nahin karti
 He has brought down the stature of all institutions
 sirf bhrashtachar main lipt rahi he
 At the same time, the government has also failed on the foreign policy front
 maldive jaisaa chota desh bhi hamen aankh dikhaata he
 It took so long to resolve the Chinese incursion issue
 bijepi ne sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon par bhi hamalaa kiya
 Sushma Swaraj said that growth rate alone cannot be a measure of economy
 7
 Projects worth 5 crores are stalled
 bhrashtachar kii vajah se janata buree tarah mahangaai jhel rahi he
 Sushma alleged that PM increases the prices and decreases Sonia
 sushamaa ne kaha ki upie-2 raajnneetik taur par naakaam rahi
 There is no coordination between the organization and the UPA government
 gathbandhan ko jo netritv chahie, vah nahin mila he
 The comments jetali ne kaha ki jab desh kii raftaar kam thi tab bhi kisi ne policy paralisis shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 Today there is so much stagnation in policies that the government is being criticized everywhere
 lokapal par andolan ke baavjood bill nahin bana
 He further said that the country has never seen such an atmosphere of despair
 yah sarkaar ahankaar se bhari he
 Next week we will organize Jail Bharo agitation against the policies of the government
 arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii uplabdhi bas itani he ki usne chaar saal puure kar liye

 Amid controversy over US author Wendy Doniger's book, 'the Hindu: An Alternative History', publisher Penguin had to settle out of court with an organization 'save Education Movement' (SBA)
 esb ne is kitaab par aarope lagaaya tha ki yah hinduon kaa apmaan karti he
 After the controversy, the publisher removed the book from the Indian market
 kai samikshakon ne penguin ke is vyavhaar kii yah kahkar aalochana kii ki isse bharat main abhivyakti kii aazaadee par vipareet asar padegaa
 The book 'the Accidental Prime Minister - The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh' by Sanjay Baru, former media advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, sparked political controversy and the book made a number of sensational revelations that drew top Congress leaders and especially the party chief
 Sonia Gandhi was very angry
 kai logon ne is vivaad ko vipanan prapanch kah kar aarope lagaaya ki aisa bikri badhaane ke liye kiya gaya
 However, the effect was truly seen as books were sold in the market after the controversy arose
 bahari sans book store ke manager mithilesh singh ne kaha, 'vivaad se nishchit rup se kitaab kii bikri badhati he
 People start thinking that the book will be banned and it will not be found later

 is kitaab main unhone daawa kiya ki sonia gandhi ne 2004 main apane putr rahul gandhi ke dabaav main pradhanmantri pad thukraa diya tha
 Publishers greatly benefited from the controversy
 natwar singh kii kitaab bazaar main aane ke ek saptaah ke bheetar isaki 65 hajaar prati bik gai, jabaki baru kii kitaab kii kuch hi saptahon main 75 hajaar pratiyaan bik gayi
 Caroline Newbury, Random House India's vice president of marketing and promotions, told IANS, "this year saw some very sensational publications, which sparked widespread debate
" 'unhone kaha, 'aisa nahin he ki ham vivaad paidaa karne vaali kitaaben chhapate hai, lekin aisi ankahi kahaniyaan chhapane kii koshish karte hai, jinhen likhane vaale us kahani ke bich se hi hon
 Unfortunately, the main themes of the book shied away from discussion amid these debates
 phul cirkil or hindi pocket books kii nideshak priyanka malhotra ne kaha, '(kathy ko pehle se hi jagajaahir karne dene vaali) kitabon kaa desh ke prakaashan udyog main ek nayaa chalan dekhne ko mil rahaa he

 Delhi is focused on the preparations for the Commonwealth Games and the dengue mosquito is arranging death for Delhiites
 dilli main dengue marijon kii sankhya roj bad rahi he lekin khatra yaheen khatm hone vaala he, aapaki dhadkane badhaanevaali khabar he ki dengue kaa virus majboot ho rahaa he, uski paanchavin strain taiyaar ho rahi he jisase hamaare aapke sharir kaa immune system lard nahin paaegaa or teji se failega dengue
 The mosquito has become the cause of many deaths in Delhi today
 aspataal main sainkadon marij khatarnaak dengue beemaari ke shikaar hokar bhartee hai or jindagi salaamat bakhshane ke liye dua maang rahe hai
 But the situation that is in Delhi right now is nothing in front of the danger that lies ahead
 asli khatra to aage he
 Yes, a study of the Microbiology Department of AIIMS All India Institute of Medical Sciences i
e
 AIIMS of the country has shown that the dengue patients are lying in all the hospitals of Delhi and NCR
 aspataalon ke liye dengue ke marijon ko bed muhaiyaa karana mushkil ho rahaa he
 We are frightened by the increasing cases of dengue in the whole of Delhi, but it is nothing in front of the danger ahead
 dengue failaane vaale virus swarup badal rahe hai
 Due to which a new strain of dengue virus can arise and this new strain will be much more dangerous than before
 iske aage hamaari pratirodhi kshamta bhi hogi laachaar or immune system nai strain ko nahin maar paaegaa
 There are currently four strains of dengue virus
 dengue virus kaa paanchavaa strain zyada shaktishaalee hoga
 That is, dengue will spread more quickly as new strains are born
 aaj se kai guna zyada sankhya main marij aspataalon main honge
 The study means clear if the mosquitoes that spread dengue have not been eradicated
 isi tarah badhate rahe dengue ke virus to tay he dilli kii tabaahi
 Giving this information does not mean to instill fear in your heart
 makasad yah hai aapako vakt rahete sachet kar den, aane vaale khatre se aagaah kar den
 Today, the condition of Dengue that Delhi has done and that is enough to make us upset you
 aspataal marijon se bhare pade hai, marijon kii sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he
 The fact is that the number of patients is more than the official figures
 pichley 24 ghante main dengue ke 54 nae maamle saamne aae hai or sarkari aankadon ke mutabik dengue marijon kii sankhya 450 ke paar ho chuki he
 By the way, how well the government figures are told, you also know very well
 dilli main dengue ke kahar kii hakeekat yah he ki marijon kii sankhya sarkari aankadon se kahin zyada ho sakati he
 The number of patients admitted to various hospitals in Delhi and NCR can be gauged from the fact that in some areas, patients are now finding it difficult to have beds in the hospital
 ek anumaan ke mutabik dilli main dengue marijon kaa aankada 5000 ke paar chukaa he
 According to experts, the government figures are far from reality
 kyonki sarkari aankadon main anregisterd nursing homes main aae marij to gine hi nahin jate
 Telling the figures less will not change the reality of Delhi, the number of dengue patients will not reduce, the risk of death from the head of the people of Delhi will not reduce, but the government effort is still to cover up the reality
 agar privet aspataalon main bhartee marijon ke sahi aankade sarkaar tak pahunche or sarkaar use tavajjo de to bhayaavah sthiti apane aap saamne aa jaaegi
 Government is blinded by the real danger

 “madhyayugin ataarkik hone kaa ek rup he dharm or jab ham ise aadhunik hathiyaaron se mila dete hai to yah hamaari azaadi ke liye khatara ban jaataa he
 This monolithic religious controlism has left a dangerous wound in the heart of Islam and today we have seen a sad result in Paris
 main sharli abdo ke saath hum or ham sabko iske saath hona chahie taaki ham vyangy kii kala kaa bachaav kar saken, jo hameshaa hi beyimaani, morrkhtaa or aatank kii satta ke khilaaf azaadi kii takat rahi he
 Respect religion has become afraid of religion
 duusare anya vichaaron kii tarah dharm kii bhi aalochana honi chahie, vyangy hona chahie or haa, bina dare anadar bhi
 Here Salman Rushdie's statement is translated from English to Hindi so that we are not limited to condemning the Paris incident
 un sawaalon se bhi takaraaen or uthaaen jinhen dharmik satta ke naam par dabaaya ja rahaa he
 You can fit this point of Salman Rushdie in any country of the world and debates in the street of that country
 bharat main bhi aae din dharmik satta ke naam par die gaye moorkhtapurna bayanon ko dharm ke aadar ke naam par sahi tehraaya ja rahaa he
 In the name of faith, we have witnessed one to one violent act all over the world
 aasthaa or aadar ne jitna dharm ko sahaj or sulabh nahin kiya he usase kahin zyada hinsak kiya he
 These are the questions of faith and respect in whose name people of political parties compromise with religious organizations
 unhen apni chuni hui satta kaa visheshadhikaar saunpte hai
 People from religious organizations force political parties to compromise
 aakhir hamane kab yah sweekaar kar liya ki aalochana, vyangy yaa sawaal karne se dharm kii satta kamazor ho jaati he
 Why do you think that by making cartoons or writing songs, disrespect has been done to the extent that the existence of religion can be in crisis
 duniya ke har dharm main acchhee baaten hai to buree se lekar bahut buree baaten hai
 We have to face it
 ham hi nahin sadiyon se log karte aae hai tabhi jaakar dharm kii kuch buraaiyon par kaabo paaya ja sakaa he
 This is yet to be overcome
 dharm ke prati hamaari kamazor samaj ne aasthaa or aadar kii lakeer ko or gaharaa kiya he
 It has deepened so much that we are beginning to accept the arrogance in its name as divine
 hamen ab yah samajhnaa hoga ki aakhir kyon duniyabar main dharm hinsa kaa kaaran ban rahaa he
 This much allegiance to religion is not right
 hamaari naagarikta or rashtriyata dharm ke naam par paribhaashit nahin ho sakati he
 Efforts are being made, but have not been successful and if successful, we will all become a Ponga citizen like those who understand rituals as religion, we call them Ponga Pandits
 duniyabar main dharmik raashtra kii satta kaayam karne kaa khwaab dikhaane vaale moorkhon kii chaal ko samajhiye
 Do not hand over the power of your conscience to any contractor
 dharm kii satta hamen chunauti de rahi he
 Change the name of religions, but there is no difference in the misdeeds occurring in its name
 kahin iske naam par koi bandook chalaa rahaa he to koi dange karvaa rahaa he
 In these riots, pregnant women have been ripped up to their stomachs and people have been locked in houses and burnt
 gale main tair daalkar jalaayaa gaya he
 There is a need to show eye to the statements made in the name of religion on the coming day
 aasthaa agar apana jawaab sirf hinsa se hi dena samajhati he to zarurat he ki ham is aasthaa ke khataranaak mansoobon ko pahchaan len
 So question religion
 vyangy kiijie
 Follow and respect too, but do not make the naturalness of this stone so much that one day the head of the follower will be torn
 hamaari kamazori kaa sabase taqatvar or atarkit rup dharm hi he
 It does more to limit our possibilities
 sadiyon se aise logon ko dharmbhiru kaha jaataa he
 When the number of Dharma brothers who practice religion increases, then the possibility of creating violence in religion increases
 isliye dharmik banie dharm bhiru nahin
 If it is a matter of respect, who will decide it
 kab or kahaan se tay hoga
 Here people come out to tear posters even on the slightest criticisms
 duniyabar main sharli abdo ke cartoon kii peshewar aalochana bhi hui he
 There have always been many opinions on its not being printed
 kai logon kii raay he ki ye cartoon jaanboojh kar bhadakaane vaale rahe hai
 Such cartoons of many religions have been made in Charley Abdo
 par yahi tarika behatar he ki ham isaki peshewar aalochana karen
 Say that is a slut
 bekaar he
 Not worth printing
 ghatiya vyangy he
 If you want to protest on the streets in a democratic way, do that too
 lekin isaki jagah bandook uthaa len, hinsa karen, aag laga den to yah ek foohad cartoon, foohad film yaa samvaad se bhi ghatiya or adharmik kaam he
 We as a citizen should prepare ourselves to listen and tolerate the strictest criticisms of religion
 varna ham kisi sanghathan ke istemaal kiye jane laayak khilone se zyada kuch nahin hai
 Do not use religion to intimidate and intimidate
 jaise kisi bhi loktantr main sawaal karne kaa jazbaa hi aapako behatar naagarik banaata he usee tarah kisi bhi dharm main anadar karne kaa sanskaar hi aapako behatar dhang se dharmik banayega
 The power of religion is not divine
 iske naam par satta batorne vaale loukik hai
 Belongs to this world isliye unhen sawaalon ke jawaab to dene honge
 Disrespect religion without fear in its name
 theatre or tivi actress sunita rajvar ne navazuddin siddiki ko legal notice bhej diya he
 Sunita has sent this notice to Nawaz for dragging his name in his book 'an Ordinary Life'
 notice main sunita ne navaj se 24 ghante ke bheetar maafee kii maang kii, saath hi 2 karod rupee harjaana bhi maanga he
 Let me tell you that Nawaz has written for Sunita in her book that she was my first girlfriend
 main safal nahin tha isliye unhone mujhe chhod diya tha
 After this, i used to think of suicide
 aalochanaon se sharminda hue navazuddin ne maangi maafee, waapas lee apni kitabasunita ke saath navaj ne actress niharika singh ke saath bhi apane rishton kaa khulaasa bhi kitaab main kiya tha
 Sunita alleges that Nawaz has misrepresented her in the book and lied about her
 unhone mujhe kitaab main villen kii tarah dikhaaya he
 My family and in-laws did not know about this affair
 unke khulaase ke baad meri nijee jindagi disturb ho gai he
 Sunita has also sent notices to Nawaz to journalist Rituparna Chatterjee (who helped him write Nawaz's book) and the book's publisher
 'tumhen auraton kii izzat kerani nahin aati navaj, ghin aati he tumse'kitaab main navaj ne sunita ke liye kya likhaa thakitab main pehle pyaar kaa khulaasa karte hue navaj ne sunita rajvar kaa naam liya tha
 He claimed that when he had a breakup due to unemployment, he started thinking about suicide
 is par sunita ne fasebuk par post likhakar bataaya ki navaj ne kai jhooth bole hai
 The real reason for Nawaz's leaving was not what he said
 sunita ne likhaa he ki navaj hamaari personal, intimet baaten apane doston main bataate the or hansate the
 So i left them
 sunita ne fasebuk post main kya likhaa thakehate hai naseeb vakt badal saktaa he, insaan kii fitrat nahin
 After reading Nawaz's book, he felt like this and suddenly remembered a lion of 'mailaram Wafa', "once he saw me smiling, such a reality is the rest of the stories"
 kyonki is biography main kaaphi had tak sirf chapai he, sachai nahin, kai baaten nawaz ne apane man se, apane hisaab se or apane haq main likhi hai, chit bhi meri pat bhi meri tips
 He has also called himself evil in a very beautiful way and has equally blamed all the evil of his evil on women
 khaskar mujh par, kyonki unki maane to mere baad unka pyaar or auraton se vishwaas hi uth gaya tha or unke saare imotions RIP yani rest in pis ho gayi the
 However, as far as i am concerned in his biography, the result of his lies starts from where my mention, ie from the first two lines of the beginning, where Nawaz is saying that he never met me in NSD
 NSD main wo mere ek saal senior the to zaahir he mulaakaat to hoti hogi
 Yes, there was nothing between us at that time, but to say that never met, it seems a bit strange
 4 khulaase: 18 saal pehle saath kaam kar chuke navaj ko nahin pahachaanate the aamir khanphir unhone kaha ki main unke ghar kii deevaaron main art-work karti thi, hamaare naam ukera karti thi, dil banaaya karti thi, jinke bich se hokar kabhi-kabhi tir bhi guzara karata tha
 After reading this it felt as if i did not go to meet him, but to take his Arts and Crafts class
 had to tab ho gai jab unhone romantic bollywood movie style main likh diya ki hamaare brake-ap ke baad unhone white paint kii baaltee lee or brush se mere art-work ko diwaar se or mujhe dil se mitaate gaye
 Now the question arises that when i had never made any art work, then whose art work are they talking about, let these small things be ignored, but the real game, they have Played where our break-up came from
 nawaz hameshaa se Sympathy seeker rahe hai, wo koi asi chiz nahi chhodte jahaan se sahanubhooti batori ja sakati ho, kabhi apane rang rup ko lekar, kabhi garibi ko lekar, kabhi ye kahkar kii wo wochaman kii naukari kar chuke hai, jab kii sach to ye he ki us vakt unka fimali becoground mere fimali becoground se acha tha
 Seeing such an inscrutable success makes one feel a bit scared of success sometimes
 kair, nawaz kaa kahana he ki wo garib the or stregalar the isaliye maine unhen chhod diya
 So what was I, Nawaz, i was poorer than you, you were living in your house at least, i was staying in a friend's house and was struggling
 filmon ke liye itani fees lete hai navaj, bataaya actress se padaa tha pehla thappadaye sirf tum acchhee tarah jaanate ho ki hamaara rishta ek play se shuru hokar us play ke maatr teen sho se pehle khatm ho chukaa tha, kyonki tumhaari sachai mere saamne aa chuki thi
 i had stopped taking your phone, because it was disgusting to think about you, what would you talk to me
 maine ye kabhi nahin kaha ki tum apane kariyar par focus karo or main apane
 Now that you have already crossed all limits, also know why i left you, i left you because you used to share all personal things with our common friends while making fun of our relationship
 tab mujhe pataa chalaa ki tum aurat or pyaar ke bare main kya soch rakhte ho
 The second big lie that forced me to write this post is that after your success, i started telling people that once you and i had deep relations
 naa maine tab kisi ko kuch bolaa tha or naa aaj tak kisi ko kuch bataaya
 Then why such a big lie, Nawaz, if you become very truthful, you would also print the name of those people in your biography with whom i used to tell you about our relationship after your success
 aisi thi navaj kii miss lavali kii pehali film, 157 Scenes par aapattitumne likhaa he ki main tumhaara pehla pyaar thi, sookhe main pehali barish kii tarah, agar ye pehla pyaar tha to bhagwaan kare kisi ko esa pehla pyaar na mili
 Today the name is yours, you are doing a good job, so i did not say then, but now i will definitely say focus on your career
 maine tumhen tumhaari garibi kii vajah se nahin tumhaari garib soch kii vajah se choda tha
 You proved with your biography that the Nawaz i knew today is much poorer than that
 naa tumhen tab auraton kii izzat kerani aati thi or naa hi ab sikh paae ho
 All i can say on your situation is, "go, you are capable of complaining, now you are much smaller than my complaint"
 
 And yes, i am not a mountain, but a mountain
 
 
 mahila ayog main cese darj:media reports ke mutabik dilli ke vakil gautam gulati ne rashtriya mahila ayog (encidblyoo) main navazuddin ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai thi
 According to a report, Gautam has written in his report that Nawaz mentioned all these things in the book without thinking, which can have a bad effect on the life of the victim woman
 koun hai sunita?aapako bataa den ki sunita 'ye rishta kya kehalaata he' main dhaniya ke role main dikh chuki hai
 With this, he has also done serials like 'shagun', 'ramayana', 'hitler Didi', 'santoshi Mata'
 sunita sirf serialon main hi nahin blki filmon main bhi najar aati hai
 She has worked in films like 'main Madhuri Dixit Bane Wate', 'ek Chalis Ki Last Local', 'sankat City'
 desh ke pramukh dharmasthalon main se ek rameswaram se nigam karmiyon kii asamvedansheeltaa kii hairaan karne vaali tasviren saamne ai hai
 At the same time, this insensitive attitude of corporation personnel and police has raised questions about the preparedness of the pilgrims
 darasal rameswaram kii tirthayatra par ai ek bujurg mahila shraddhalu kii durghatana main maut ke baad nigam karmiyon kaa uski laash ke saath bartaav hairaan kar dene vaala rahaa
 Corporation personnel took the dead body of an elderly woman pilgrim to a hospital in a Kokchara vehicle
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mahila shraddhalu 54 varshiya ramamani beete guuruuvaar ko amavasya par rameswaram tirthayatra ke liye ai hui thi
 The victim Ramamani was a resident of Odisha and had come to Rameswaram for pilgrimage
 lekin rameswaram main guuruuvaar ko ek water tanker kii chapet main aakar uski maut ho gai
 Ramamani died on the spot after being crushed by a water tanker
 lekin police ne shav vaahan se le jane kii bajaay nigam karmiyon ko shav ko aspataal pahunchane kii jimmedaari saunp di
 Corporation personnel also showed complete insensitivity with the body
 unhone bujurg mahila tirthayatri kaa shav kachra vaahan main ladakar aspataal pahunchaaya
 It is also worth noting that there are only two dead bodies in the entire Pamban district

 ye bhi padhensatypal malik bole- pulisavaalon kii jagah bhrasht netaaon kii hatya karen aatanki Janata Dal United (JDU), the party of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has supported the citizenship amendment bill
 rajyasabha main party ke saansad aaaraseepi singh ne iskaa elaan kiya
 Shortly afterwards JDU national vice-president Prashant Kishore opposed the party's decision
 unhone twitor par likhaa, is bill kaa samarthan karne se pehle jediu netritv ko un logon ke bare main sochna chahie tha, jinhone 2015 main party par bharosa or vishwaas jataayaa tha
 While supporting # CAB, the JDU leadership should spare a moment for all those who reposed their faith and trust in it in 2015
 We must not forget that but for the victory of 2015, the party and its managers wouldn’t have been left with much to cut any deal with anyone
 - Prashant Kishor (@prashantkishor) December 11, 2019 Senior party leader Pawan Kumar Verma has also urged party president Nitish Kumar to reconsider it
 party ke netaa pawan verma ne mangalvaar ko twit kar likhaa, main nitish kumaar se apil karata hum ki rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke samarthan par dobaaraa vichaar karen
 This bill is completely unconstitutional and is against the unity of the country
 yah bill jediu ke mul vichaaron ke bhi khilaaf hai
 He claimed that if Gandhiji had been there today, he would have opposed it
 isse pehle prashanth kishor ne twit kar apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue likhaa, naagarikta sanshodhan bill par jediu ke samarthan se niraashaa hui he
 The bill provides for citizenship on the basis of religion, which is discriminatory
 prashanth kishor yaheen nahin ruke
 He further targeted the party, writing, "the jdu's support of the Citizenship Amendment Bill is different from the party's constitution, which already has the word secularism written on the page thrice
" kishor ne sidhe party ke netritvkarta or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko bhi aade haathon lete hue twit kar aage likhaa, naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak par party kaa samarthan party ke netritv ke vichaardhaara se mail nahin khaataa he, jo ki mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron se prerit he
 The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had announced an alliance bypassing the Congress to stop Narendra Modi's Vijay Rath in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019
 iske baad priyanka gandhi ke rup main congress ne bada daanv chalaa or unhen party kaa mahasachiv banaate hue purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi, jiske baad se soobe kii siyasat teji se karavat badal rahi he
 As a result of this, now the SP-BSP is seen in the mood of agreement and wants to make Congress a part of the alliance
 sutron kii maane to sapa-basapa ne soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se congress ko 15 siton kaa ofer de diya he, lekin ab party ne siton kii demand badha di he
 The Congress wants at least 25 parliamentary seats in the state
 congress netaaon kii maane to vah soobe main sapa-basapa ke baraabar hi siten chaahati he
 In this way, for them, the three parties will contest 25-25 seats and the remaining five seats should be kept for smaller allies like RLD
 bataa den ki pichley maheene akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 During this time, he had decided to contest 38-38 seats in the 80 Lok Sabha seats of the state
 iske alaava do siten gathbandhan kii anya partiyon ke liye chhodane kaa faisla kiya tha
 At the same time, it was decided not to field a candidate against the Congress in amethi-rae Bareli

 It has not been announced yet
 darasal iske peeche priyanka gandhi kii raajnneetik entry maani ja rahi he
 Recently, there was news that SP-BSP will formulate political strategy in a new way
 iske baad wo siton kii bantwaaraa karenge
 With Priyanka's political entry, the Congress has been emboldened
 congress priyanka gandhi ko purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke avatar ke rup main pesh kar rahi he
 Clearly, the political battle of the state is now seen to be triangular instead of two poles
 congress jis tarah se dilli main alpsankhyak sammelan kiya or rahul gandhi ne obisi dalit maton ko saadhane ke liye 13 point roster ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye hai
 It was natural for the SP-BSP to develop uneasiness
 darasal sapa-basapa gathbandhan kar jis votbank ko apni majbootee maanakar chal rahi hai, usee main priyanka send lagaati hui najar aa rahi he
 The manner in which the Congress has started the exercise of bringing the Muslim votebank, Brahmin and Dalit votes into its fold, it may bring back the hopes of winning the SP-BSP alliance
 yahi vajah he ki congress ko gathbandhan main shaamil karne ko lekar manthan shuru ho chukaa he

 ipel main david warner ke balle ne sabhi gendbaajon kii neend uda rakhi he
 Wherever the ball is, Warner does not miss to show him the way to the boundary
 warner ipel main naa sirf cricket ke orthodox shots achche khelte hai balki iske saath-saath wo switch hit, reverse sweep jaise shot bhi itane behtareen andaaj se khelte hai ki virdohi gendbaaj pareshaan ho jaataa he or use samaj nahin aata ki warner ke liye fielding kisi lagaai jaae
 Aggression against KKR David Warner batted well in the initial matches of IPL, his strike rate was not so high but as the tournament progressed Sunrisers Hyderabad captain became aggressive and played against Kolkata Knight Riders on 30 April In the match gone, Warner reached the peak of aggression
 kolkata nite rides ke khilaaf warner ne sirf 43 gendon main shatak jamaa diya, unhone 59 gendon main 126 ran kii visphotak pari kheli
 Kolkata's bowling attack is considered to be the strongest attack in the IPL but Warner hit 8 sixes and 10 fours against the same bowlers
 warner ne khaastaur par kolkata ke spinners ko aade haathon liya
 Special strategy against spinners: Warner had a special plan to deal with KKR spinners
 unhone sunil naren or kuldeep yadav jaise spinners kii unhone khub dhunaai kii
 Warner played a massive reverse sweep and switch shots against the spinners
 kuldeep yadav or sunil naren donon warner ke shots ko dekhakar chakra gaye or unhen samaj nahin aayaa ki aakhir warner ko kis length or line par gend phenki jaae
 Warner can bat with both left and right hands, there are many batsmen in the cricket world who take reverse sweep and switch hits, but no batsman has played these shots well
 isaki sabase badi vajah ye he ki baayen haath se ballebaaji karne vaale warner daaen haath se bhi ballebaaji kar lete hai
 Yes, when Warner started playing cricket at the age of 13, during that time his coach advised him to bat with the right hand because he played most of the shots in the air while batting with the left hand
 maa kii salaah ne badla kariyarvarner ne coach kii salaah par ek sijan tak daaen haath se hi ballebaaji kii lekin iske baad warner kii maa ne unhen dobaaraa baayen haath se ballebaaji karne ko kaha jiske baad warner ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha

 input:bhashaa Ministers' quarrel in BJP is now on the road
 pehle grahamantri rajnath singh ne safai di ki unke bete pankaj singh ke bare main media main jo khabaren aa rahi hai, unamem yadi rattibar bhi sachai hui to vah raajnneeti chhod denge
 Then came a statement from the Prime Minister's Office that the reports that have been coming about the conduct of some Union ministers and the Home Minister's son for the past several weeks are incorrect
 yah us vyakti ke saath hi saath sarkaar kii chhavi bigaadane kii bhi koshish he
 It is not in the national interest to spread such a rumor
 pradhanmantri karyaalay in khabaron kaa khandan karata he
 In fact, such political gossip is often carried by politicians and journalists in the Central Hall
 kai akhabaaron main is tarah ke gocip kollam bhi kaaphi lokapriy hai
 After the coming of the new government, what kind of gossip was in the discussion, you know: - sabase pehle nitin gadakari kii jasusi kii khabaren ain, kaha gaya ki gadakari ke mumbai ke ghar main baaten sunne ke liye koi upkaran lagaaya gaya he
 The matter grew so much that the Congress did not let the Rajya Sabha run and the Home Minister had to give a statement and clarify
 aglaa maamla khud grahamantri ke bete se sambandhit he
 It is gossip that the Prime Minister told the Home Minister that your son is doing well, i want to meet him
 afvaahon ke mutabik, pradhanmantri ne rajnath ke bete ko mulaakaat ke aakhir main apana vyavhaar sudhaarney ke liye kaha, maamla kuch len-dein kaa tha
 Rajnath complained to senior party leaders, including the Prime Minister and the party president
 asal main yah mahaj afvaah nahin he, yah sarkaar ke do bade mantriyon ke bich satta kii ladaai he
 This fight is also number 2 in the cabinet
 kaayade se grahamantri ko sarkaar main number do mana jaataa he, lekin do bade mantralay sanbhaalane vaale ek mantri number do par apana daawa karte hai
 However, let me tell you some more gossip
 ek mantri ko keval is baat ke liye daant pilaai gai ki unhone falaan udyogpati ke saath khaanaa tha
 Not only this, another minister was warned not to dress properly
 ek bade mantri ko samay par daftar na aane par chetavanee di gai
 Another minister was barred from going abroad for his child's college celebrations
 kul milakar jab se nai sarkaar bani he, tabhi se is tarah kii afvaahen failane lagi hai
 Initially it was good, the Prime Minister has tightened the rein, because everyone knew that many ministers in the Manmohan Singh cabinet were unbridled
 pradhanmantri kii baat tak nahin maanate the
 In such a situation, the rumors coming from the Modi government were sounding good, but now the matter came to the fore when Rajnath Singh complained to a senior colleague of his own to the Prime Minister
 ek baat bataa duun ki bijepi main ek puraani beemaari he, of record brifing kii
 Many politicians have a habit and the news has been planted on this excuse
 sabake patrakaron ke apane gut hai, jinhen pehle khabar di jaati he
 It is called the inner circle, while some BJP leaders say that if we do not have any off-record, then journalists are also divided in the BJP
 aisa har party main hota he, kisi main kam kisi main adhik
 But Rajnath Singh's statement opened up the bundle of controversies, which until now was called political gossip, was not taken seriously and it damaged the image of the Prime Minister, whose image is that of a no-nonsense prime minister
 cabinet main bade mantriyon ke bich ahan kaa takaraav hameshaa se rahaa he
 It ranged from the Nehru cabinet to Manmohan Singh
 kaha yah bhi jaataa rahaa he ki manmohan singh ko apane ek vitt mantri ke bajet bhaashan kaa pataa tab chalata tha ki bajet main kya he, jab vittamantri apana bhaashan loksabhaa main pard rahe hote the, magar is baar laga tha ki is pradhanmantri ke kaal main yah sab nahin hoga, lekin nai sarkaar ke aane ke baad khabaron kaa tota hone laga
 When the dependence on twitter and press releases for the news increased, the journalists had no choice but to take these political gossip seriously and began to appear prominently
 kya karen loktantr main patrkaar, netaa or unki gutbaji ek rajnatik sachai he or ham sab isse majaboor hai
 Everyone enjoys political gossip and it cannot stop, no matter how many restrictions are imposed
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne bhavishya nidhi (pief) kii adhiktam seemaa 10,000 rupee se badhaakar 15000 rupee kar di he
 a government spokesman has said this while giving information
 iskaa matlab ye he ki pehle karmchaariyon ko pief kaatane kaa phayda adhiktam 10 hajaar par miltaa he, jise ab badhaakar 15 hajaar kar diya gaya he
 The spokesman said, the Jammu and Kashmir government has amended the Employees Provident Fund Scheme 1961 and raised the limit from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 for the subscribers of the Provident Fund
 yah badlaav 21 disambar 2015 se prabhavi hoga
 Significantly, recently the EPFO has taken an important step to make the process of withdrawal of PF money easier

 Till now, the application had to be certified by the company, but now you can apply directly to the EPFO i
e
 Employee Provident Fund Organization to withdraw the PF
 yah suvidha un anshadharakon ke liye hogi jinka universal yaa portable pief khaataa sankhya (yueen) sakriy ho chukaa he or jiske liye bank khaataa or aadhaar sankhya jaisi jaankaree di ja chuki he
 Employees who want to remove PF without attestation of their company will have to apply in new forms
 team india ke cricketer or purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ke sanyas kii khabaron par unke manager or dost arun pandey ne bayaan diya he
 Arun Pandey has said that Dhoni has no intention of retirement yet
 unhone kaha ki abhi maahi ke cricket chhodane kaa koi plan nahin he
 Let me tell you that speculation started on Dhoni's retirement after the team's World Cup journey in the World Cup stopped in the semi-finals
 arun pandey se pehle dhoni ke coach keshav banerjee ne kaha tha ki vah tii-20 world cap tak khelnaa jari rakh sakate hai
 He had said that i believe Mahi should play in T20 format
 50 over kii wicketcaping or phir ballebaaji ke saath vanade khelnaa sharir ke liye bahut kathin hota he
 Then he is always in action on the field due to the added pressure of helping bowlers and fielders
 jabaki tii-20 main unhen itani jaddojahad nahin kerani padegi
 Keshav Banerjee said that Dhoni's current fitness level shows that this is sufficient in the shortest format of the game
 mujhe lagata he ki vah agle tii-20 vishwa cap main khel sakate hai
 There has been no official statement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Dhoni's retirement so far
 lekin banerjee kaa maananaa he ki is bare main jald hi faisla liya janaa chahie
 Let us know that Dhoni has been constantly under the target of critics for his performance in the World Cup-2019
 aath maichon main unhone 273 ran banaae, jo kisi bhi bhartiya madhyakram ke ballebaajon dwaara sabase adhik he

 pichhali barsaat main puure ek din ke liye ye shahar tham gaya
 The Great Traffic Jam opened the doors of this progressive city
 or prashasan or nagar nigam kii laaparvaahee saamne aa gai
 This time too, the paperwork is being done in the name of preparations
 gurugram nagar nigam ke senior toun planar kaa kahana he, 'gurugram main trephic jam kaa mukhya kaaran yahaan kii bhugolic sthiti or har din badhati gadiyon kii taadaat he, par is baar ham puri tarah taiyaar hai or naaliyon kii saaf safai ke saath saath sadakon kii marammat kaa kaary bhi jor shor se chal rahaa he
 There are many traffic interrupted points in Gurgaon where the hours of office hours are jammed
 gurugram trephic di si pi balbir singh kaa daawa he ki is baar pichhali baar jaise halaat nahin banenge
 We have put 24-hour traffic officers on duty and will not allow any jam situation, but it is important that during the rainy season, the general public should also use public transport as much as possible, use car pulling and office cabs, so that roads Load reduced
 gudgaanv ek aisa shahar he jahaan har roj ek imaarat khadi kii jaati he or duusare kii neenv daali jaati he
 There is neither a concrete master plan of construction nor any development strategy in this city
 yahaan kuch ilaake haryana deveopment athurity yani huda ke antargat aate he to kuch emsiji ke or jin pramukh sadakon par enechaeai kaa kaary pragati par he vahaan saaf safai, water loging or trephic prabandhan kaa jimmaa enechaeai kaa he
 Due to the constant construction at the local level and the responsibility of cleaning and repairing roads in different areas, the cocktail of pre-monsoon preparations is causing problems for the general public here
 yahaan kisi tuuti sadak kii compline karne se pehle janata is sawaal main ulajh kar rah jaati he ki unke ilaake kii zimmedaari kiski he
 Water logging on roads is the main reason for the increasing traffic problem in Gurugram as soon as it rains and to know why water logging occurs, we have to understand its geographical structure
 - gurugram pahaado ko kaat kar basaaya gaya he
 Most of the areas here are built without any planning 
 - zyaadaatar township, sector or hai rising societes main sivej or pani nikasi kii vyavastha nahin he
 Earlier there used to be many dams in Gurugram which fell for urbanization
 - pahaado ke nichle hisse main based hone ke chalate ab pahaado kaa pani bhi shaharon main aa kar jamaa ho jaataa he
 Due to lack of proper drainage facilities in the city, water gets collected on the roads
 trephic kahaan sabase zyada he - vaise to gurugram main 23 jagahon par hameshaa hi jam kii sthiti bani rahati he
 But these are the major places
 - rajeev chowk- hanuman chowk- hero honda chowk- iffko chowk- golf course road- sadar bazartuti sadakon par bade gadde gurugram ke har ilaake main aam he
 The reason for the negligence is that the roads outside the mini secretariat where the office of the Collector and other top officials are disturbed

 In such a situation, the selection of Deoband for the joint rally of Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav and Ajit Singh is also very special
 isse bhi khaas is raily ke dauraan uthaae gaye mudde hai
 Maya, Akhilesh and Ajit raised the issue of demonetisation, GST to sugarcane farmers and stray animals
 mahagathbandhan ke sahyogi basapa pramukh mayawati, sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav or rashtriya lokdal ke mukhiya choudhary ajit singh ne chunavi raily main pehali baar manch saajha karte hue kaha ki is baar chunaav main garib, dalit tathaa alpansakhyak milakar jumalibaajon ko sabak sikhayenge
 Sugarcane farmers try to get their hands on the pulse of sugarcane farmers
 mayawati ne ganna kisaanon kii nabj par haath rakhane kii koshish karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa kii karjamaafee or bakaayaa ganna mulya kaa bhugtan mahaj jumalebaji sabit hua
 i want to assure that if we get a chance to form a government at the Center, strict instructions will be given to all states not to keep any dues of the farmers
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki yahaan ke logon ne ganna paidaa karke puure desh ko mithaas se jodne kaa kaam kiya
 Sugarcane should stand in your fields, but the government does not care
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki duniya ko hamaare desh par garv he, lekin hamaara desh har cheez main peeche chalaa ja rahaa he
 The rest of the world is moving forward, while our country is going backward
 aawaara pashuon ke bahaane modi-yogi par hamalaaganna kisaanon kaa hi zikr karte hue mayawati ne kaha ki upi main bijepi kii sarkaar ne aawaara pashuon ke jariye kisaanon ko or bhi barbaad kar diya
 Sugarcane farmers are also worried
 vahiin, ajit singh ne kaha ki modi ne kaha tha ki ganne kaa daam 400 rupee prati quintal hoga
 In Mayawati ji and Mulayam Singh Yadav's rule, the price of sugarcane was available to the farmers
 aaj adaalat ke aadesh ke baavjood sarkaar ganna mulya nahin chukaa rahi he
 Modi and Yogi are grazing the crop of the farmer, so different
 notebandi or jiesti par mayawati-akhilesh ne modi ko gheraamayawati ne kaha ki notebandi or jiesti se berogari badi he
 The country's economy has been badly affected
 saath hi bhrashtachar bhi badha he
 Much of PM Modi's time was spent saving his capitalist friends
 unheen kii chaukeedaari karte rahe
 They continued to prosper
 desh ke kisaan is sarkaar main shuru se hi dukhi rahe
 At the same time, Akhilesh said that we saw that the feet were being washed on TV, while the jobs of Dalit brothers kept going backwards, GST did not benefit the small businessmen
 vahiin, ajit singh ne kaha ki modi ne varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kaha tha ki vah har saal do karod rojgaar denge
 But far from increasing employment, two crores were reduced
 vah yuvaaon ko pakora banane kii salaah dete hai
 Mayawati's allegation, in addition to Mayawati raised the issue of reservation in the reservation Kota Khaledevband rally in the country
 mayawati ne aarope lagaaya ki kendra kii pichhali congress sarkaar kii hi tarah maujuuda bhaajapa sarkaar ne daliton, pichhadon, muslim tathaa anya dharmik alpsankhyakon kaa koi khaas vikaas nahin kiya

 maine ek saal pehle unhen kalaghoda mahotsav main karadi tels padhate hue dekha
 i was very impressed by what i saw and heard and i also started taking interest in Urdu literature

 # indvspak Every day new allegations are being made about Asaram
 roj nae khulaase ho rahe hai
 The latest revelation is that sex-enhancing drugs were sold in Asaram's ashram
 yadi aapako isse pehle hua khulaasa yaad ho to asaram ke 'kaale kaarobaar' ko aasaani se samaj paaenge
 Earlier it was revealed that the people engaged in the service of Asaram were fed with herbs and made them famous
 is jadi-booti main kele kii jad kaa istemaal hota tha
 No one else, but one of Asaram's servants had told this
 ye bhi padhein-asaram ke sevadaar kaa khulaasa: sevadaaron ko banaaya namardais sevadaar ne yah bhi bataaya tha ki asaram ke is krity ke chalate kai ghar tuutane kii kagaar par pahunch gaye the
 Now, if you understand these two things in sequence, then you will know what kind of business Asaram and his companions ran
 asaram pehle apane sevadaaron ko aisi booti khilaate, jisase unki kaamashkti behad ksheen pad jaati
 The feeling of sex in them was completely suppressed
 ek baar dawa ke seven se kai dinon tak sex kii ichha paidaa nahin hoti thi
 Meaning here, the work was done to prepare patients, who needed treatment
 padhein-is ashram main milti he mardaangi kii dawa!iske baad apane hi ashram main bani sex shakti badhaane or jaagrit karne kii dawa bechney kaa kaam hota tha
 Apparently, when people came to know about the breakdown of their house, they would buy this medicine, and thus this business of Asaram would go on
 asaram ke surat ashram main sapt dhatuvardhak booti naam kii dawa bechi ja rahi thi
 The Food and Drugs Department suspects that these drugs use chemicals that have not been given any harm
 padhein-jab jodhpur court main gidgidaae asaramsurat ke food and drug vibhaag ne jahangirpura sthit asaram ashram main chhapemari kii to naa sirf shaktivardhak dawaaen, balki 5 anya aisi dawaaen bhi milin, jisamen istemaal kiye gaye rasayanon kii ijaajat nahin di gai thi
 The names of those medicines are Banh Booti, triphala Tablet, Amla Churna, Kapha Kewal and Rasayana Tablet
 padhein-paakhand ke bhagwaan kii kaise hui hawa gulfood and drugs vibhaag ne ashram se mili sandigdh dawaaon ke sample jaanch ke liye bhej die hai
 Baba's problems can increase if proven to be without chemicals
 baharhaal, ye sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki aakhir satsang ke liye chalaae ja rahe ashramon main shakti vardhak dawaaon ke beche jane kaa kya matlab he?asaram par naaballig ladki ke saath yon shoshan ke aarope hai
 His son Narayan Sai is absconding for six days following the rape charges
 patni or beti par ladakiyon ko aawaaj nahin uthaane kii dhamkee dene kaa aarope he
 It has been two years since the horrific disaster in Uttarakhand, but the remains of the human body still continue to be found
 haal hi main ek tuuti hui imaarat ke khandhar ke malbe main ek maanav pair ke avshesh mili hai
 Rudraprayag SP Barinderjit Singh said that the remains of the human foot were seen in a narrow street about 50 meters from the Kedarnath temple on Saturday, when some locals were cleaning the debris from the building
 unhone bataaya ki maanav ang ke avshesh kaa usee din panchnaama or diene sampling jaisi jaruri aupchaariktaayen puri karne ke baad antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 The police officer, however, said that despite several search operations in the area after the disaster, there is still no surprise in finding skeletons there
 singh ne kaha ki kedarghati main jin 600 se zyada logon ke avshesh mili or unka antim sanskaar kiya gaya, ve sataha par paae gaye the
 There is still a heap of 50-60 feet high in the vicinity of the temple and it is no surprise that something else can be found under it
 unhone kaha ki pehle malbe ke andar imaaraton kii puri ek manzil dabi hui he or ab sthaneey logon ko apni imaaraton se malba saaf karne kii ijaajat de di gai he to aise main kuch or milane kii ashanka ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Nishank has targeted the Congress government on this issue in Nishank, the former Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and BJP MP from Haridwar, Nishank
 centre sarkaar ke ek saal puraa hone par rudki main yojit kiye gaye ek kaarykram main unhone kaha, 'main kedarnath se yahaan aa rahaa hum
 This government is neither with the people alive nor has it shown the ability to remove dead people in Kedarnath
 'unhone kaha ki do saal biit jane par bhi kedarnath mandir ke paas shav dabe pade hai
 i myself am coming after seeing hell
 vahaan ke log cheekh chilla rahe hai ki hamaare logon ko nikaal to dijie
 The government has neither allowed these bodies to be removed nor has the bodies been removed
 isse zyada kharaab sthiti nahin ho sakati
 ' dilli ke haujakhaas ilaake main sthit elf cafe and baar main bounsar deepak tandon maut maamle main uske pita ne aarope lagaaya he ki uski hatya kii gai he
 The deceased's father Gulshan Tandon says that Deepak asked him to play Punjabi song in the bar
 iske baad vahaan jhagada shuru ho gaya
 After this, he was killed by hitting a beer bottle
 police ne deepak ke shav ko postmortem ke liye bheja he
 This case is being investigated
 peshey se bounsar deepak tandon apane do doston ke saath 31 disambar kii subah dilli pahunchaa tha
 She had posted a photo on Facebook while leaving from Ludhiana
 iske baad deepak ne dilli pahunchakar conot place, palika bazaar main ghoomane ke dauraan bhi fasebuk par kai tasviren share kii
 Her last photo was shared from Hauz Khas village at 8
39 pm on 31 December
 is aakhri tasviir ke saath deepak maut ke agosh main chalaa gaya
 First photo date - 31 December 2016 time - 1 o'clock at 50 o'clock in the morning - on the way to Delhi
 Deepak, who arrived in Delhi from Ludhiana to celebrate the year, had no clue that death was moving towards him
 uski maut apane saath itane sawaal lekar ai jinhen sulajhane main dilli police ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 As much as the police are trying to solve the mystery of Deepak's death, it is becoming more and more complicated
 pub kaa staff or deepak ke dost or gharavaale alag-alag daawey kar rahe hai
 According to the pub staff, Deepak hit a beer bottle on his own head
 uski vajah se uski maut ho gai
 Families are accusing the pub's bouncers of hitting the bottle
 vaardaat ke vakt maukey par hi maujuud deepak kaa dost vikram kah rahaa he ki ek bounsar ne deepak ke sir par bear kii bottle maari thi
 However, he is unable to tell what the fight was about
 us vakt wo kahaan or kya kar rahaa tha
 Police sources say that Deepak himself hit the bottle on his head
 deepak kaa deje par gaanaa chalaane ko lekar jhagada hua tha
 He was then forced out of the pub, but he later re-entered the pub and started quarreling
 isi jhagade ke dauraan usne bear kii bottle apane sir par maar lee
 Deepak's father feels this is a conspiracy
 unka kahana he ki punjabi gaanaa chalaane ko lekar unke bete kii hatya kii gai
 Last year, a biography of Congress President Sonia Gandhi came into the limelight
 'da red sari'
 Spanish writer Javier Moro had seriously explained how Sonia and Rajiv got married
 abek or kitabai he
 'nether a hawk nor avo'
 pakistan ke purv videsh mantri khurshid kasuri ne is kitaab main sonia gandhi ke mazaakia andaaj kii baaten kii hai
 Kasuri has written that Sonia once jokingly told him that she married Rajiv because he was a beautiful young man
 musharraf kii bharat yatra kaa zikrakasuri ne kitaab main 2005 main tatkaaleen paak raashtrapati parvej musharraf kii bharat yatra kaa bhi zikr karte hue is mulaakaat ke bare main likhaa he
 Then Sonuri, who came to meet Musharraf, was received by Kasuri
 mulaakaat se pehle gambhir thim soniyasuri ne likhaa he ki sonia jab musharraf se milane ain to kaaphi gambhir lag rahi thim
 i thought i could put a smile on his face
 maine unase ek zikr chhedaa
 
 
 
 or yah sun muskura uthinkasuri ne likhaa, maine sonia ko ek kissa sunaaya
 While i was in Cambridge and walking with Sohail Iftikhar (nehru's friend and son of Congress leader Mian Iftikharuddin), i saw a beautiful young man coming in front of the King's Parade
 maine sohail se poocha ki vah koun he, to unhone bataaya ki vah rajeev he, pan
 Grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru
 sonia muskura uthin or boleen- isiilie to maine unase shaadi kii
 The story of indo-pak match has written that when we reached the Ferozeshah Kotla ground, Sonia Gandhi and Foreign Minister Natwar Singh were already there
 pakistaniyon kii acchhee khaasi maujuudagi main shahid afridi kaa naam jor-jor se liya ja rahaa tha
 i felt that the balls coming from Afridi's bat were coming towards us
 is par natwar singh ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha, aap afridi ko bhi apane saath hi le jaaen
 Sachin Tendulkar's rival is considered to be Brian Lara of the West Indies in terms of style and ability
 inamen koun behatar he, or takanic, pari kii shuruyaat tathaa maansik majbootee ke maamle main donon main kya fark he, in sawaalon par do dashakon se samalochak ulajhate rahe hai
 Lara told Aaj Tak's sports editor Vikrant Gupta what the differences are between him and Sachin
 baatcheet ke anshtaap pari kii shuruyaat or uske baad apni maansik avasthaa ke bare main kya kahana chahenge? yah sachin se kitna alag he?main kisi match ke pehle jamkar abhyaas karata rahaa hum
 i think my attitude and Sachin's attitude in this matter are the same
 maaikel jordan ne kabhi kaha tha ki ve itani kadi mehnat se taiyaari karte hai ki khel ke dauraan unhen sab kuch niyantran main lagane lagata he
 Nothing unfamiliar to them, everything becomes easy
 pari ke bich main mujhamen gendbaaji par haaavee hokar jeetne kaa nasha chaa jaataa tha
 In my understanding, Sachin believes in giving the bowlers a few overs, by contrast, at the right time
 yani meraa tarika zyada dhooma-dhadaaka machaane vaala he
 How does your style — such as standing poses, backlifts, variations in strokes, sudden acceleration or dimming in between innings — is so different from other bowlers? i backlit the bat to hit the ball faster i do main khaskar bhartiya upmahadweep ke spinneron ke khilaaf footwork kaa zyada istemaal karata hum
 i try to stand at ease and let him come to the bat instead of getting hit on the ball
 sachin bhi pairon kaa istemaal zyada karte hai
 They overcome bowlers in their own way, their shots are more traditional than mine
 aap main badi pari khilne kii anokhi kaabiliyat thi
 How did you maintain concentration for so many hours? When i scored my first Test century, Rohan Kanhai was there
 unhone mujhe shaabaashi di lekin achaanak ve mere paas aae or kehane lage ki or dhyaan lagaao or bada score banaao
 Since then i have always been focused on big scores
 agar aap bhartiya team main virendra sahvaag, rahul dravid, saurabh ganguli or vivies lakshmana ke saath hote to kya aapaki style badal jaati? or iske ulat sachin agar west indies main hote tab kya karte?mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 For me, batting has been scoring runs for the team
 mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi bhi team main khelte hue meri style badalati
 But these players had to compete very hard to make their place
 main majaak main kahata hum lekin yah baat puri tarah bemaani nahin he ki sachin ko west indies team main aasaani hoti
 What is the one thing that you want to learn from Sachin and Sachin with you? i would have learned to play calmly like him
 ve kabhi ghabaraate yaa oobate nahin hai
 Sachin might want to learn a natural game like me
