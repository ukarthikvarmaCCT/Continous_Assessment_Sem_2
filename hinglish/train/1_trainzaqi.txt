 ham unhen bataanaa chaahate hai ki hamane to sabase pehla kaam yah kiya he ki desh ko bolne vaala pradhanmantri diya he
 We have given such a transparent government at the center on which even these two and a half years, opponents have not been able to make any allegations of corruption
 booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki sonia-manmohan kii sarkaar ne 10 varshon main ek ke baad ek ghotaale kiye, antariksh se lekar pataal tak 12 lakh karod rupee ke ghapale-ghotaale kiye or rahulji poochhate hai ki fark kya aayaa he

 He said that during the 10 years of the sonia-manmohan government, nobody used to go insulting our borders, insulting our jawans, beheading martyrs on the border and not licking the lice of Delhi's rulers
 unhone daawa kiya ki rahul gandhi ko fark pataa nahin chalegaa kyonki unki aakhon par italy kaa chashma laga hua he

 bhaajapa vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par ek nishchit lakshya lekar chalane vaali party he
 He said that if we do not connect the people of the whole country with our goals, then we cannot achieve our goals alone
 bhartiya janata party apane booth kaaryakarta ke bagaiyr kabhi chunaav nahin jeet sakati, yah hamaari kaarysamskruti he, hamaari vichaardhaara ko aage badhaane ke liye booth kii jo rachana kii gai he, use jansangh se lekar ajtak hamane bahut mahatv diya he
 He said that the role of the organization also becomes very important to connect the people of the country with the goal of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bhaajapa ek aisi party he jahaan chote se chote kaaryakartaaon ko bhi bade maukey milte rahete hai
 He questioned whether there is any other party in the country where a person born in such a poor home can become the Prime Minister of the country while working in the organization, to become such, you have to be born in a certain royal family
 unhone kaha ki kai partiyon main pehle hi tay ho jaataa he ki party kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga

 ) Shah appealed to the Prime Minister to give 15 years to bring change in the country from panchayat to Parliament
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki rahul gandhi gum-ghumkar kehete hai ki in dhai varshon main kya fark padaa he
 We want to tell them that the first thing we have done is that we have given the Prime Minister speaking to the country
 hamane centre main ek aisi paardarshee sarkaar di he jisapar in dhai varshon main virdohi bhi bhrashtachar kaa koi aarope nahin laga sake hai
 Addressing the booth level activists, he said that sonia-manmohan's government has done scams one after the other in 10 years, scams worth Rs 12 lakh crore from space to Hades and Rahulji asks what is the difference 
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha ki aatankwaad, bhrashtachar, jaali karency or jaali noton par modi sarkaar ke kade prahaar kaa virodh karke sapa, basapa, mamata, congress or kejariwal ne apane-aapako desh kii janata ke saamne expoj kar diya he
 This decision has been taken in the interest of the country, whose benefit is going to get the most from the poor in the coming times
 shah ne kaha ki 7 november tak vipakshi partiyaan pradhanmantri modi par kaledhan par karrwai ko lekar hai-tauba machaa rahi thi, 8 november ko kaledhan par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kathor karrwai karne ke baad ab unhone ulti hai-tauba machaa rakhi he ki notebandi kyon kar di? unhone kaha, ‘main bataanaa chahta hum ki is ek faisle se aatankwaadi, naksalwadi, jaali note or nashe ke kaarobaari nirdhan ho gaye hai, desh ke arthtantr ko khokhla karne waalon ke paas padaa hua dhan raddi main tabdeel ho gaya he
 Shah said that black money was sucking the blood of the country's economy by becoming canker, we have eliminated it in one stroke
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi bhi kaale-dhan par karrwai kaa virodh kar rahe hai, hamen rahul baba par to koi aashcharya nahin ho rahaa he, unke salaahkaaron par jarur taras aa rahaa he
 He said that we had promised before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections that if the Bharatiya Janata Party government is formed in the country and Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister of the country, then we will work to secure the borders of this country
 unhone kaha ki sonia-manmohan sarkaar ke 10 varshon main koi bhi hamaari simaaon kaa apmaan karke chalaa jaataa tha, hamaare javaanon kaa apmaan karata tha, seemaa par shaheedon ke sir kaat liye jate the or dilli ke hukmaranon ke jun tak nahin rengti thi
 He claimed that Rahul Gandhi would not know the difference because he had Italian glasses on his eyes
 sonia-manmohan kii sarkaar ke samay seemaa par golibari kii shuruyaat pakistan kii sena karti thi or ant bhi pakistan kii hi sena karti thi, aaj bhi seemaa par golibari kii shuruyaat pakistan kii sena hi karti he lekin use khatm bhartiya sena karti he
 Shah said that today our soldiers do not need to take orders from Delhi to give a befitting reply to the enemies, today the bullet on the border is answered with shells
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki bhartiya janata party or baaki partiyon ke chunaav jeetne kaa tarika alag he
 The BJP is a party with a definite target based on ideology
 unhone kaha ki yadi ham apane lakshya ke saath ham puure desh kii janata ko jod nahin pate to ham akele apane lakshya ko hasil nahin kar sakate
 The Bharatiya Janata Party can never win an election without its booth worker, it is our work culture, we have attached a lot of importance to the ideology of the booth which has been created to advance our ideology
 unhone kaha ki desh kii janata ko bhartiya janata party ke lakshya ke saath jodne ke liye bhi sanghathan kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn ho jaati he
 BJP is a party where even the smallest activists get big opportunities
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya desh main koi duusari party he jahaan itane garib ghar main janm lene vaala vyakti sanghathan main kaam karte-karte desh kaa pradhanmantri ban sake, aisa banane ke liye aapako ek nishchit rajgaraane main janm lenaa padegaa
 He said that in many parties it is already decided who will be the next president of the party
 congress kaa udhaaharan dete hue unhone kaha ki congress kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga, yah sabko pataa he lekin bhartiya janata party kaa aglaa adhyaksh koun hoga, kya yah kisi ko pataa he?tippaniyan Amit Shah said that BJP is the only party whose even a booth-level worker can become the national president of the party
 chunaav main haar-jeet bhaajapa ke liye koi myne nahin rakhti lekin yadi hamaara sanghathan majboot banataa he to hamen jeetne se koi nahin roak saktaa
 Shah said that for the first time after 30 years, the people of the country have taken a decisive decision and the Bharatiya Janata Party government has an absolute majority under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke baad yadi kisi gaiyr-congressi dal ko desh kii janata ne purna bahumat dene kaa kaam kiya to vah bhartiya janata party he

 The central government has entrusted the responsibility of improving the situation in Jammu and Kashmir to the PDP-BJP government of the state, but according to sources, the center will not wait longer
 sutron ke anusaar centre ab kadaa faisla karne kii taiyaari main he
 The Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh is in Jammu and Kashmir on a two-day visit, and the central government will decide on his return
 is maheene ke ant tak jammu-kashmir main chal rahi ashaanti ko 50 din se upar ho jaaenge
 Law and order is a state issue and the state government has taken several steps on its behalf
 centre sarkaar lagaataar in qadamon par najar rakh rahi he
 The visit of Home Minister Rajnath Singh is considered to be very important in this sense, because the steps taken by the state government so far can also be reviewed during the review of the security system
 grahamantri kii vaapasi ke baad centre sarkaar aage kii karrwai ke bare main faisla karegi
 It is believed that the Central Government has prepared a list of 80 such people who are engaged in creating unrest in the state and inciting children and youth
 ab yah apeksha he ki rajya sarkaar inke khilaaf sakht karrwai karegi
 If this happens, it will not take long for the situation to come under control
 ucchpdasth sutron ke mutabik centre ke saamne kai vikalp hai
 One of these options may be to impose governor's rule there

 The idols are always in discussion in Uttar Pradesh, irrespective of the party
 is vakt daliton kaa mudda garmaya hua he lihaaja bhimrao ambedkar kii pratimaaon ko puure desh main khatra bana hua he
 Damaging the statue is also a sensitive issue from the perspective of law and order in UP
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ne puure pradeshbhar kii ambedkarpratimaaon kii hifaazat kaa hukum police or prashasan ko diya to nae najaare bhi saamne aane lage
 In many cities, a lock was placed around Ambedkar's statue with a grill or lattice
 lakhanu ke ambedkar vishvavidhyalay main to adamkad pratimaa va anya choti pratimaaon ko gril or channelget se gherkar taala laga diya gaya he
 This is not the first time this is happening
 isse pehle tamilnadu main ambedkaror periyar kii pratimaaon kii gheraabandi or talabandi ho chuki he
 Statues were also damaged on the day they came there
 ambedkarajayanti ke aasapaas pratimaaon ko khatra zyada hota he
 Bhimrao Ambedkar has more statues than Mahatma Gandhi in UP
 deshbhar main donon kii hi pratimaaon par hameshaa khatra rahata he
 Gandhiji's statues are in more than 70 countries and hardly insulted in any other country except Pakistan
 pratimaaon kaa apmaan karne vaale vichaaron ke str par behad kamjor or murkh log hote hai
 Understanding that damage to the image or picture will end the thought is gross stupidity
 lekin shararti tatwon ke alaava pratimaa ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale anya log uske anuyaayiyon kii bhavanaaen aahat karnaa chaahate hai jisase log aakrosh main aate hai or kanoon vyavastha dagamagaati he
 There is also a mentality to maintain dominance by damaging the symbols
 upi main pratimaaon kii raajnneeti kaa shrey bahujan samaaj party supremeo mayawati ko jaataa he
 Whose own statues are also installed
 lekin ambedkarki pratimaa ko sidhe votbank se judaa mana jaataa he
 Three years ago in Uttar Pradesh, a 150-feet tall statue of Ambedkar was announced near Lucknow
 kaha gaya tha ki ye vishwa prasiddh christ redimer se bhi oonchi hogi par baad main is par koi khaas pragati nahin ho saki kyonki iske liye jameen nahin mili
 But there is enough land in the entire country for the politics of Dalits
 usamen murtiyon lagati hai or unka apmaan hota he
 The two political parties then accuse each other and the process continues unabated
 13 april ko yani ambedkar jayanti se thik pehle noida main ambedkarki pratimaa ko nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he, police duusari pratimaa lagane ke liye haath-pair maar rahi he
 Even with the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, there is often bad name
 pratikon or rashtriya sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaana logon kii aadat main shaamil ho gaya he kyonki ise rajaneta hawa de rahe hai or sarkarein maun rahati hai
 It is believed that most of the idols in the whole world are of Gautama Buddha, but they may not have as much politics as the statues of the great men of our country
 *** President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Pravin Togadiyane has once again given the spark of homecoming and love jihad
 guuruuvaar ko ranchi main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue vihip adhyaksh ne iske bahaane bollywood actor salmaan khan or shahrukh khan par nishaanaa saadhaa he

 maharashtra main shivasena ko do baar zordaar jatke lage hai or ve bhi bhaajapa se
 First, when the BJP won a good number of seats in the last assembly elections, making the Shiv Sena irrelevant
 doosraa jhatka laga guuruuvaar ko jab biemasi ke nattejey aae
 The BJP, which has scared Shiv Sena in the ground, has now shaken Shiv Sena's house
 shivasena ne mumbai main bhaajapa se behatar pradarshan kiya he
 But this difference is of a few seats
 is khel main isbaar ranaap hi vinar he or yah shivasena se behatar koi nahin samajhataa
 The confident Uddhav Thackeray may not even be able to sleep peacefully on Thursday as the biggest worry over the joy of his victory is the bjp's unexpected victory
 bhaajapa ne shivasena ke aatmavishvaas or durg ko hilaa diya he
 The Shiv Sena, built on the identity of Maharashtra, now looks quite small and helpless ahead of the BJP
 jeet kii mithai uddhav ko isliye bhi feeki lag rahi hogi kyonki maratha asmita or pahchaan ke taur par seenche gaye mumbai main shivasena ko bhaajapa se hi takkar milegi or bhaajapa unpar nirbharta kii aadat ko chirakar khud khadi ho jaaegi, aisa unhone sochaa nahin tha
 bjp's victory is betting on the mandate given to Shiv Sena
 saath hi shivasena ko apana ghar or apni choudharahat jaati nazar aa rahi he
 Worries about the future of Shiv Sena are hidden in bjp's victory
 jis tevar or tadi ke saath uddhav is chunaav main utre the or jis tarah unhone raaj thakare tak se haath milaane se manaa kar diya tha, yah janadesh us puure ahm ko zordaar thokar martha nazar aata he
 Only Mumbai is where the victory of Shiv Sena is seen as comforting
 baaki kaa maharashtra bhaajapamay nazar aa rahaa he
 The BJP, which is spreading in the grounds, has now entered the house of Shiv Sena like fire and hence the victory of Shiv Sena is causing a fire like fire in the evening of marriage
 sambhav he ki raajnneeti kii nirbharataayen donon ko ek-duusare ke saath laakar khadaa kar den or donon ekasaath biemasi sambhalate nazar aaen, lekin is saath main shivasena apni kachot ko nahin bhula paaegi or uski jeet main chhipi haar sapanom main bhi uddhav ko pareshaan karti rahegi
 This victory for the BJP is icing on the cake
 wo maharashtra main or aatmavishvaas se bhari khadi nazar aegi
 She would also like to convey this message to the rest of UP through her non-marathi (and UP voters would be better said directly) in Maharashtra

 a member of the executive committee said on the condition of anonymity, 'the members were unanimous that the relationship with the institution which is a regular defaulter in terms of payment cannot be continued
 ’ nimbus ne oktober 2009 ko chaar saal ke liye bisisiai ke saath 2000 karod rupee kaa qaraar kiya tha
 The broadcaster paid Rs 24 crore today before the executive committee meeting here but still has to pay Rs 88 crore
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘ek bhi shrinkhalaa aisi nahin hui jisamen unhone puraa paisa samay se diya ho

 'as per the agreement, Nimbus gets to BCCI for every match, around 31 per international match
 5 karod rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa tha
 Apart from the current payment, the issue of radio rights was also pending between BCCI and Nimbus for a long time

 When contacted, Nimbus Sports chief operating officer Yannick Colasso said he was not aware of any such decision

 comphed dwaara sudhaa deyari ke vibhinn brandon kaa daam ek se teen rupee badaye jane kii jaankaree milane par pashu sansaadhan mantri giriraaj singh ke hastkshep karte hue doodh ke daam vruddhi par philhal roak lagaae jane kaa nirdesh diya
 Singh said that he has instructed the departmental secretary to immediately stop this increase in milk prices till the issue is discussed
 bharat main petroleum padaarthon ke mulyon main lagaataar vruddhi ho rahi he, jisase aam janata pareshaan he
 Recently, the prices of petrol and diesel have been increased again
 par nepal se sate bhartiya border ke logon ko isse koi fark nahi padataa he
 When the price of petroleum products increases in India, people here are happy, because they buy petrol and diesel of their need not from Indian pump but from Nepal pump
 khuli seemaa hone ke kaaran unhen koi dikkat nahi ho rahi he
 But due to the Indian people taking petroleum from there, the demand for petrol diesel has increased in Nepal, which is also affecting the lives of the people there
 agar keval bihar ke border raksol kii baat karen to ek taraf seemaa se sate bhartiya petrol pump par sannata he to dusri taraf nepal ke pump par baari bheed dikh rahi he
 Petrol 10 in Indian currency in Nepal
 62 rupee kam he to dijal 14
 20 rupees is cheaper
 raksol ke pump par petrol 73
 44 rupees and diesel 62
 01 rupee bik rahi he, jabaki nepal main vahaan kii mudra main petrol kii keemat 100
 50 and the price of diesel is 76
 50 rupee he
 The price of Indian 100 rupees in Nepal is 165 rupees Nepali
 yani nepal main bhartiya rupee ke anusaar petrol kii keemat 62
 82 rupees and diesel 47
 81 rupee main mil rahaa he aise main seemaa se sate log jamkar petroleum padaarthon kii taskari kar rahe hai
 Officials of Nepal Oil Corporation believe that due to the difference in price, the demand for petrol diesel has increased by 20 to 25 percent in Nepal, while supply is getting same as before
 unka kahana ki bharat se aane vaali tamaam gaadiyaan yahaan tel le rahi hai or unhen ham roak nahi sakate
 The drivers say that Nepal is close and there is such a difference in the prices of oil, then why not fill the oil there

 babar kii yah dhamaakedaar shuruyaat unke bade khilaadi banane kaa sanket de rahi he lekin is baat kaa nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kai khilaadi aise rahe hai jo kariyar kii shuruyaat main chamak dikhaane ke baad jald hi paridrishy se ojhal ho gaye
 Apparently after this comparison, the pressure of expectations on Babur would also have increased
 pakistan ke purv tej gendbaaj or rawalpindi express ke naam se mashhoor shoeb akhtar ne is tulana par behad sanyat pratikriya di he
 Shoaib, who frightened the famous batsmen with the speed of his balls, tweeted that coach Mickey Arthur believes that Babar is as good a batsman as Indian cricketer Virat Kohli
 babar or viraat kii tulana ke maamle main, main yah kahana chaahunga ki yuva ballebaaj kii prashansa karnaa to thik he lekin use philhal kisi saanche main na dhaalein
 Let him enjoy batting now
 ajam ne ab tak keval teen test match khele hai
 He missed a century against New Zealand in Hamilton by a slight margin in the test
 babar ne naabad 90 ran banaae lekin pakistan kii puri team out ho gai thi
 Apart from three tests, Azam has played 18 odis, scoring three centuries
 ye teenon shatak unhone is saal ke shuru main westeindies ke khilaaf lagaataar lagaae the
 This blistering debut of Babar is indicative of him becoming a big player, but it cannot be ignored that there have been many players who soon lost their perspective after shining early in their careers
 jaahir he is tulana ke baad babar par apekshaaon kaa dabaav bhi bad gaya hoga
 Shoaib Akhtar, former Pakistan fast bowler and known as Rawalpindi Express, has given a very moderate response to this comparison
 apni gendon kii gati se nami ballebaajon ko bhaybheet karne vaale shoeb ne twit karke kaha ki coach miki arthor kaa maananaa hi ki babar, bhartiya cricketer viraat kohli jitne hi achche ballebaaj hai
 In the case of comparison of Babar and Virat, i would like to say that it is okay to praise the young batsman but do not cast him in any mold at the moment
 use abhi ballebaaji kaa anand uthaane den
 Shoaib, who frightened the famous batsmen with the speed of his balls, tweeted that coach Mickey Arthur believes that Babar is as good a batsman as Indian cricketer Virat Kohli

 Indian cricketers, who are not satisfied with less than the Indian spinners flop on the turning wicket, will face the team's defeat in the semi-finals
 mahendra singh dhoni kii aguwai vaali team se ummid thi ki apni sarajameen par vah duusari baar tabadatod cricket main badshahath sabit karegi
 While Kohli single-handedly led India to the semi-finals, the bowling of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja was average
 donon ne paanch maichon main kul aath wicket hi liye
 On the turning wickets, he could not get the ball to turn and on the pitch of batsmen Wankhede he was beaten fiercely
 world tii20 viraat ke naam rahaaskaaratmak pahaluon kii baat karen to kohli ne khud ko sachin tendulkar kaa vaaris sabit kar diya jo karodon bharatvasiyon kii ummiido kaa boj kandhe par lekar khelte rahe
 Kohli scored 273 runs in five matches, but seeing his batting skills more than the figures of runs, people pressed their fingers under the teeth
 terning pich par pakistan ke khilaaf naabad 55 ran banane ke baad australia ke khilaaf usne naabad 82 ran banaae
 In the semi-finals too, he scored an unbeaten 89 and gave the team a big score but the result did not come in India's favor
 kohli ke 29 chauke behtareen shots the chaahe vah cover drive ho yaa square cat
 If Rohit, Shikhar and Rainakohli are not flopped, then no other Indian hero appears in the World T20

 Rohit, however, fared better in the semi-finals

 ek duulhe ne ek hi mandap main do bahanon se shaadi rachaai

 (hemanth sharma ke input ke saath) The new Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh, Sulkhan Singh, has been discussed on all sides
 kisi vivaad ke chalate nahin balki unki saadagi, karmthata or eemaandaaree kii vajah se
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has given several messages simultaneously by making Sulkhan Singh the DGP of UP
 isse jahaan eemaandaaree se kaam karne vaale adhikariyon kaa manobal badha he vahiin rasukhdaar netaaon se jugad ke dam par apane hit saadhane vaale afasaron main bechaini he
 Despite being the most senior in the police force, Sulkhan Singh's name was not ahead for the top post in khaki uniform, but Yogi surprised everyone by stamping his name
 senapati ke taur par upi police kii kaman sulakhan singh ke haath main aane ke baad bhrasht afasaron ke chehre sabase zyada latake hue hai
 What is Sulkhan Singh's specialty? What is their role model? Know the story of sulakhan singh unke bare main wo 5 baaten jo aap shaayad nahin jaanate honge
 1
 onasti ij da best policy:sulakhan singh apni duty ke 36 saal ke kaarykaal main jahaan-jahaan bhi tainaat rahe, vahaan sab jagah unki eemaandaaree kii kaside padhe jate hai
 Sulkhan Singh: Honesty is not an obstacle in one's path
 jo beyimaan hai pareshaani to unhen uthaani padati he
 The honest man does not have to prepare any defense
 ye to jo beyimaan he unako is tarah kii taiyaari kii jarurat padati he
 So i always believe that Honesty is the best policy! 2
 saadhaaran parivaar, asaadhaaran vyaktitv:sulakhan singh kii paariwarik prishthbhumi bahut saadhaaran he
 He has a 3-room kachcha house in Banda, where his old parents and brothers live
 sulakhan singh lakhanu main ld ke 3 kamare ke flats main rahete he
 Sulkhan Singh: i go to Banda every four months
 kabhi-kabhi mata-pita bhi yahaan aate he, par unako lakhanu kii jagah banda main rahanaa hi zyada raas aata he
 Here the house of Lucknow is taken in installments which are not yet completed
 3
 Irresistible in front of challenges: Sulkhan Singh Varanasi or Allahabad or Unnao, wherever he managed to leave a different mark
 chaahe 1984 main varanasi kaa chaatr andolan tha yaa phirasamazaadee party sarkaar kedauraan panishment posting ke taur par unnav training centre main tainaati
 Sulkhan Singh's personality flourished in every challenge
 sulakhan singh :ye sach he kii 2012 main mujhe jab unnav training centre transfar kiya gaya to main aahat hua tha
 There a DIG level officer is appointed and i was a senior for this
 maine virodh bhi kiya par meri sunwaayee nahin hui
 Despite this, during the three-year tenure, i did such work in the training center that i received the medal of 'excellence in Training' from the Government of India

 Childhood Memories and Ramcharit Manas: Sulkhan Singh has four brothers and his father is a farmer
 unke paas mahaj 2
 There is 3 bighas of land
 sulakhan singh or unke bhaaiyon kii schuli shiksha banda main hi hui
 Sulkhan Singh: Our generation in our family is the first in formal education
 hamaare pitaaji sirf ek-do saal hi skool gaye
 All his knowledge is of Ramayana and Mahabharata
 unheen se hamane ramcharitamanas kaa puraa paath siikhaa
 Our parents always encouraged
 pitaaji thodaa roak-tok karte the magar unako puraa bharosa tha
 By the grace of God everything went well
 5
 Simple life, high thoughts: Due to the simplicity of Sulkhan Singh, his batchmates used to call him Yogi
 banda main unhen subah uthakar yoga karte aksar dekha jaataa tha
 Sulkhan Singh: The Chief Minister is a monk and i do not compare him
 ye sahi he mainyog karata hunor training ke silebus main bhi yoga ko shaamil karaayaa
 But just by doing Yogasana we do not become a yogi
 hamen apana vyavhaar sudhaarna chahie, or agar aisa hota he to sab kuch sahi ho jayega
 Dhoni retired from Test cricket, his life began to be postmortem afresh
 aise hi ek prakaran main tamil actress or model lakshmi raay kaa bayaan bhi saamne aayaa he
 According to the news, there was some time affair between Laxmi Rai and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 phir donon kaa brallep ho gaya
 Talking to an English newspaper, Laxmi Rai said, today so much time has passed, but whenever Dhoni is mentioned, my name is taken
 unhone kaha ki aaj bhi unke romance kii afvaahen udayi jaati hai
 Lakshmi said that she hates such speculation
 akhbaar se baat karte hue vah boleen, mujhe yakeen ho chalaa he ki dhoni ke saath meraa rishta ek daag ke nishaan kii tarah ho gaya he, jo aasaani se nahin jayega
 Rai said that i am surprised that people are still spending their energy in this work
 unhone kaha ki mujhe dar he ki bhavishya main kabhi mere bachche tivi par ise dekhenge or mujhase puuchhenge
 Even after Dhoni, i had relationships with three or four people
 magar use kisi ne shaayad notice nahin kiya
 Talking about her relationship with Dhoni, Lakshmi said, i knew her very well
 par ye nahin kah sakati ki kya ise kisi rishte kaa naam diya ja saktaa tha
 It never clicked
 lekin ham abhi bhi ek duusare kii bharpoor izzat karte hai
 He too has moved forward in his life
 usne shaadi kar lee he
 Our story ended there itself
 main bhi ab acting par focus kar rahi hum

 When India Today did the ranking of the colleges for the first time, it is unnoticed, but the magazine has been rating it for 10 to 12 years
 har saal best college kaa visheshank aata tha
 There used to be a picture of the number one college
 khushhaal chaatro kii tasviir hoti thi, jinhen dekhakar lagata tha ki bharat main bhi number van college hai
 We all must have seen these specials
 iske baad kai agenciyaan or news channel number van, number tu banane lage jinamein privet collejon kaa bolbalaa hone laga
 Nevertheless, some colleges remained permanent in all kinds of lists
 aisa nahin he ki us vakt sarkaar collejon kii grading nahin kar rahi thi
 Under the UGC UGC, the institution of national assessment and accredition council naac is also grading colleges and universities
 1994 main bengalooru main nack kaa mukhyalay banaaya gaya tha, koi bhi college, vishvavidhyalay ek lakh, dedh lakh, teen lakh or chah lakh tak sarvice tex ke saath fees jamaakar, nack kii team ko aamantrit karvaa saktaa he ki wo aae or unke santhaan kii jaanch kar grading de
 There are 7,674 colleges and 313 universities
 inamen se 2014-15 main 47 vishvavidhyalayon or 807 collejon ne nack se apni grading karai he
 Those with a grade have to do grading at five-five years and those below a have to do grading at three-three years
 nack kii kai report aa chuki hai
 What has improved in the quality of education from this may not be fully evaluated in the TV debate but in this context we can question that when the budget of education is getting reduced from the last three budgets only To what extent would these institutions have improved even after the grading of NAAC? pichhali teen bajet se pehle ke tamaam bajaton kaa bhi yahi haal rahaa he
 We are reducing spending in education
 kya bina karch ke hi shiksha kii gunvattta bad sakati he
 College grading may improve
 hamen yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki nack ke moolyankan kii yatra main mahanagaron ke college yaa vishvavidhyalay kii tulana main kasbon zilon or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon ke collejon ne kitna sudhaar kiya he
 Have they gone backward continuously? kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne 2016 se reating kii ek nai vyavastha shuru kii he
 The second report of the National Institutional Ranking Framework has come out
 ye nack se alag he
 NAC has grading i
e
 there can be ten colleges in one grade
 ranking main aapako number van yaa number tu jaanane ko milegaa
 Why did rankings need to be held apart from Naik
 isse ham kya alag hasil karne ja rahe hai
 Or the institution of Naik which has developed over so many years, will end
 reating kii yah nai vyavastha dhire-dhire viksit ho rahi he, isliye bahut se college aavedan bhi nahin kar paae
 Law college or medical college has not been rated this year
 bahut se college nack kii taiyaari main hi uljhe rahe, nai reating ke liye aavedan nahin kar sake, phir bhi is baar 3300 ucch sansthaanon ne isamen hissaa liya
 The list of the top hundred colleges in these 3300 has been extracted
 collejon kii nai reating kii suchi dekh rahaa tha
 Some remote colleges have also got place in the first hundred
 pehle sau main nahin balki chotii ke das or bees colejo main mili he
 All the colleges in Delhi University could not apply in the rating system, but the top twenty colleges across India have names of colleges of Delhi University which are not considered on campus and were not traditionally in the list of famous colleges
 stephens, hindu or ramajas sahit kai college ne nai reating main hissaa nahin liya tha phir bhi bharat ke sau collejon main se Atmaram Sanatan Dharma College is at number five
 dayaal singh kalege aathven number he
 Deendayal Upadhyay College is at number 9
 keshav mahavidhyalay 15 wein number par he
 Acharya Narendra Dev is at number 20
 is july main jab dilli vishvavidhyalay main admishan kii prakriya shuru hogi to chaatr is ranking ko kitna mahatv denge, kya iskaa asar college ke cat aaf list par bhi padegaa
 We just told you that Naik, an organization of the Ministry of Human Resources, also does grading
 nack kaa puraa naam hua national assessment and accredition council, maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne 2015 main ranking ke liye ek nai sanstha banaai jiskaa naam he National Institutional Ranking Framework 
 As per Hindustan Times report dated 17 January 2017, not a single college of Delhi University has been able to get a Plus
 diu ke college adhiktam e plus hi paa sake
 Nobody gets double plus
 nack kii suchi main acharya narendra dev kalege ko e grad mila he magar nifr kii ranking main 20 wein number par he
 Gurunanak Dev Khalsa College has got a b + plus in the list of NAC
 nifr kii ranking main is college kaa sthaan puure bharat main 46 waan he
 Deendayal Upadhyay College has got a b grade in Naik's rating, but in the new rankings, the college is ranked 9th in the whole of India
 tippaniyan How can this happen? The college which is not in the top ten of NAC is number one in All India and which ranks 9th among the 62 colleges of DU in the list of college NAC is number 20 at All India level
 bharat ke number van college duniya main chotii ke sau collejon main bhi nahin aa pate hai
 There is not a single college or university in India in the Times Higher Education ranking list for 2015-16
 2015-16 kii times hair ajukeshan rekking kii suchi main bharat kii ranking main number van sthaan paane vaala indian istitute aaf science 251 se 300 ke bich he
 Ranked at number three is between 351 to 400 in the IIT Times rankings
 jab duniya main mulkon kii reating ho rahi he to collejon kii kyon nahin hogi
 We TV people are killed by trps
 alian yamuna khadar main aakar gaay charaa rahe hon yaa bagdadi ko har raat maarthe rahiye, ho saktaa he ki koi channel number van ho jaae
 In our profession, number one does not necessarily mean journalism
 shaayad uniwarsity main number van kaa matlab padhai-likhaai or behatar research se hi hota ho
 But can you see the rating of universities or colleges also from this point of view
 kya reating kisi college yaa shiksha vyavastha kii sahi tasviir pesh karti he
 It was told that the rules for rating have been made very strict
 iske liye collejon ko halafanama dena padaa he
 If that affidavit were also made public, then the public could investigate
 vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog ujisi ke tahat national assessment and accredition council naac kii sanstha bhi collejon or vishvavidhyalayon kii grading kar rahi he
 Naik's headquarters was made in Bengaluru in 1994, any college, university can invite Naik's team to come and visit their institute, by paying fees with service tax up to one lakh, one and a half lakh, three lakh and six lakh
 Check and give grading
 7,674 kalege hai or 313 vishvavidhyalay
 Out of these, 47 universities and 807 colleges have done their grading from NAAC in 2014-15
 e grad vaale ko paanch-paanch saal par grading karaani hoti he or e se neeche vaale ko teen-teen saal main grading karaani hoti he
 There have been several reports of Naik
 isse shiksha kii gunvattta main kya sudhaar hua he, iskaa moolyankan tivi kii bahes main sampurna rup se to nahin ho saktaa he magar ham is sandarbh main yah sawaal kar sakate hai ki jab pichley teen bajet se hi shiksha kaa bajet kam hota ja rahaa he to nack kii grading ke baad bhi in sansthaanon main sudhaar kis had tak ho sakaa hoga
 All the budgets before the last three budgets have been the same
 ham shiksha main kharch kam karte ja rahe hai
 Can the quality of education be increased without spending? college kii grading main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 We also have to see how the colleges in the districts and state capitals have improved in comparison to the college or university of metros in the evaluation journey of Naik
 kya ve lagaataar pichhadate hi chale gaye hai
 The Union Ministry of Human Resources has introduced a new rating system from 2016
 National Institutional Ranking Framework kii duusari report saamne ai he

 nack ke alaava ranking kii jarurat kyon padi
 What are we going to achieve differently from this? yaa phir nack kii jo sanstha itane varshon main viksit hui he wo samaapt ho jaaegi
 This new rating system is developing slowly, so many colleges could not even apply
 lau kalege yaa medical kalege kii is saal reating nahin nikali he

 Many colleges including Stephens, Hindu and Ramjas did not participate in the new rating, yet out of hundred colleges in India atmaram sanathan dharm college paanchaven number par he
 Dayal Singh College is number eight
 dinadayal upaadhyaay college 9 wein number par he
 Keshav College is at number 15

 Does the rating give a true picture of a college or education system

 alian yamuna khadar main aakar gaay charaa rahe hon yaa bagdadi ko har raat maarthe rahiye, ho saktaa he ki koi channel number van ho jaae
 In our profession, number one does not necessarily mean journalism
 shaayad uniwarsity main number van kaa matlab padhai-likhaai or behatar research se hi hota ho
 But can you see the rating of universities or colleges also from this point of view
 kya reating kisi college yaa shiksha vyavastha kii sahi tasviir pesh karti he
 It was told that the rules for rating have been made very strict
 iske liye collejon ko halafanama dena padaa he
 If that affidavit were also made public, then the public could investigate

 " Bollywood actress Kareena Kapoor says that earlier she has done a lot of films for friendship, but now she will only do good story films
 karina ne kaha, 'maine doston ke liye bahut-si filmein kii
 Now i want to do films for the story
 mujhe doston ke liye filmein karne kaa pachhtaawaa nahin he
 i never consider it a mistake
 main dil se sochane vaali mahila hum, isliye yah acha he
 What to say about Kareena Kapoor's style
 
 
 karina ne 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam', '3 idiyats', 'bodyguard' or 'raa-van' jaisi vyavsaayik filmein kii hai, to 'chameli' or 'talash' jaisi filmon main alag tarah ke kirdaar bhi kiye hai
 What was the reason behind doing offbeat movies? Kareena said, 'I did' Jasmine 'and' Dev ', because i needed to balance myself
 main ek aisi parivaar se ai thi jahaan mujhe khud ko sabit karne kii jarurat thi
 i played a prostitute in 'chameli' at the age of 21
 'bollywood main karina kii he alag hi pahchaan
 
 
 Kareena said, 'in Talaash' i again played a prostitute
 donon mere kariyar kii behtareen filmein thim
 Kareena will soon be seen in the commercial film Singham Returns
 jat aarakshan andolan ke kaaran radd hui trainon ke lierelway yatriyonko unka ‘puraa paisa waapas’ karegaa
 a railway spokesperson said that no cancellation fee will be charged for these trips and full money will be refunded to passengers
 online booking karne vaale yatriyon ko swayan hi unka puraa paisa waapas mil jayega vahiin, kagaji tikat book karaane vaale yatriarakshanakendron se apana paisa waapas le sakenge
 Significantly, traffic has been disrupted on the main line of delhi-ambala-chandigarh for the last few days
 aise main railway somvaar shaam ko ek vishesh train chandigarh se dilli ke liye chalaaegaa taaki ‘chandigarh or ambala ke aasapaas ke shaharon main fanse yatriyon ko nikaala ja sake
 'this train will leave at four in the evening and take a longer route
 yah chandigarh se saharanpur, meerut, gajiabad hote hue dilli ke anand vihaar pahonchegi
 The 'new Normal' that has been made in India in the last few days has affected many things
 aise main yah zaruri he ki khataranaak chizon kii ek suchi banaai jaae jinase ham sab batch saken
 The most recent entry in this list is Leo Tolstoy's 'war and Peace', counted among the world's greatest novels
 is upanyaas ko maharashtra police ne khataranaak mana he
 This has been presented as evidence against the social activist Vernon Gonzalves arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case
 aadarneey bombai hycourt ne bhi gonjalwes se poocha ki ve aisi kitaab kyon padhate hai jo kisi duusare desh ke yuddh ke bare main he
 It is true that many people were afraid of Leo Tolstoy
 vladimir ilich lenin bhi darataa tha
 It is said that Lenin had to face two jars
 jaar nicholas dwitiya ko usne haraa diya
 But the second Tsar, who ruled the hearts of the Russian public, succumbed to Tolstoy
 tolstoy communist nahin the, lekin lenin ko maaloom tha ki ve rus kii aatma hai
 Lenin wrote several articles on him
 apane commereads ko kaha ki ve unka sammaan karen
 Why not use the book of such a dangerous man as evidence against a terrorist by Maharashtra Police
 is khataranaak aadmi ne ek duusare khataranaak aadmi ko bhi prabhavit kiya tha
 He was Mahatma Gandhi
 mahatma gandhi ne dakshin africa ke transwaal main jo ashram banaaya, uskaa naam tolstoy form rakh diya tha
 Wrote a letter to Tolstoy and finally wrote - Your obedient servant
 or tolstoy ne jawaab main jo chitthee likhi, usamen ant main unako bhai kii tarah sammaan diya
 Both found God and religion within themselves
 asahmat bhi hote the to itane sammaan se ki duusare hairaan rah jaaen
 Tolstoy rejected the principle of rebirth in a message
 mahatma gandhi ne likhaa ki ye sandesh ve chhapana chaahate hai, lekin isamen punarjanm ko kaarij karne vaali baat hataa di jaati to acha hota
 Gandhi told Tolstoy that he did not want to agree with them, just wanted to remind that crores of Indians believe in reincarnation and this idea gives them comfort
 lekin tolstoy bhi kam tede nahin the
 He wrote that he will not remove, but gives permission to Gandhiji to remove it if he wishes
 mahatma gandhi bhi kam khatarnaak aadmi nahin hai
 They found new ways of fighting
 dharm kii baat kii or dharm ke pandon ko thikaane laga diya
 Used to test his own
 unhen teen-teen goli maari gai, lekin ve nahin mare
 Everyday many people kill them - their supporters as well as their opponents - they are not ready to die
 godse kii itani murtiyon banaai gayi, kahi-kahin mandir bhi banaae gaye, lekin vah zindaa nahin ho paa rahaa or gandhi mar nahin paa rahe
 Gandhi's education was no less dangerous
 ve logon ko civil nafarmaani sikhaa gaye
 Where the gun does not move, the cannon does not move, the tanks do not move, there is civil disobedience
 sarkarein sabase zyaada isse ghabraati hai
 Some people are saying that civil disobedience has started in Kashmir too
 sach bolnaa hameshaa se khataranaak tha- in dinon or zyada khataranaak ho gaya he
 Telling the truth about Kashmir is even more dangerous
 aapako tatkaal deshadrohi ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Such truth is used by the government of Pakistan
 bharat sarkaar is maamle main paak-saafe he
 He is not meant by truth or falsehood, just by Kashmir
 vaise sabase khataranaak chiz urdu sahitya he
 Even if it is written in Devanagari script, Urdu written in Persian will not work at all
 aisi urdu main aap quran rakhen, gaalib kaa dewan rakhen, mir ke dardo-gam rakhen- aap aatankwaadi ghoshit kiye ja sakate hai
 Recently, many such cases came up in which Urdu literature recovered from his house was presented as evidence to prove someone a terrorist
 vaise kul milakar kitaaben hi khataranaak hai
 They make you think
 ve aapmen tark karne kii aadat daalati hai, tark karne laayak saamagree muhaiyaa karaati hai
 In this era of whatsapp University, the only punishment for the book readers can be mob lynching
 khataranaak chizon kii suchi or bhi lambii he
 These include computers, cds, mobiles, sims
 police kisi ko giraftaar kar yah bataa detii he ki uske ghar do computer, teen mobile or chaar sim nikle hai
 What has come out inside computers is not usually known
 bhima koregaanv maamle main bhi police ne varnen gonjalwes ke kilaaf unke yahaan se baraamad sediyaan pesh kin
 Judge Saheb, who did not know Tolstoy, also knew that the CD could not be evidence, the material in the CD may be evidence
 unhone police se poocha ki sidi main kya he
 Police said that the CD has not been seen yet
 to sidi bhi ek khataranaak chiz he
 It should be avoided
 gaay-bail yaa jaanwaron kii kareed-bikri yaa unako kahin le janaa bhi khatarnaak he
 You can be made an aspect anytime
 raste main peet kar aapaki jaan lee ja sakati he or aapako kasuurvaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 It is also dangerous if you keep meat in your fridge
 aapako iske liye ghar se nikaal kar akhlaak kii tarah maaraa ja saktaa he
 Moreover, it is dangerous to rotate young children
 aap agar upi main hai or kisi aise bachche ko lekar nikle hai jisaki shakl yaa jiskaa rang-rup aapse nahin mail khate to bheed aapako gher sakati he, peet sakati he or aapaki jaan le sakati he
 Writing is the most dangerous
 aap chaahe jitna dar-dar kar likhen, sach kahin na kahin se jhaank jaataa he- vah yaa to aapako belibase kar jaataa he yaa jiske bare main aap likh rahe hai, uski asaliyat khol detaa he
 There are many dangers about which writing is no less dangerous
 pash ne jab kaha tha ki sabase khataranaak hota he hamaare sapanom kaa mar janaa to use andaaza nahin tha ki sapanom kii samuhik hatya kaa aisa saarvajanik upkram kabhi saream chalegaa or ham khataranaak chizon kii suchi banaate hue bhi darenge

 upi ke mujffarnagar main insaaniyat ko sharmasaar kar dene vaala ek maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here, a newborn born in an ambulance succumbed to pain in the absence of treatment
 darasal morna block ke rudakali gaanv se kal der shaam saadhe nau baje morna siechasi main pahunchi ek garbhvatee mahila ko doctoron ne jila chikitsaalay ke liye refer kar diya tha
 When the family of the woman asked the ambulance standing on the CHC to be taken to the district hospital, the doctors refused to send 102 ambulances
 iske baad 108 ambulance se sampark saadhaa gaya
 After leaving the patient from 108 ambulance district hospital, when Morna arrived at the CHC, about 45 minutes had elapsed
 iske baad mahila ko 108 ambulance se jab jila chikitsaalay le jaaya ja rahaa tha to raste main hi mahila ne ek bachche ko janm diya
 This child died in a matter of minutes due to lack of treatment
 is maamle main mukhya chikitsa adhikari pi es mishra ne kaha ki vah khud morna siechasi jaakar jaanch karenge or is maamle main sakht kaarywahi karenge
 Let me tell you that even before this, there have been reports of death of people due to lack of ambulance earlier

 But due to the lapse of administration, such incidents keep coming up
 jab ambulance se mangai gai thi sharaqbhi pichley saal disambar main hi uttar pradesh ke meerut main sthit lala lajpat raay medical college main doctors ke ek program ke liye ambulance main bharkar sharaab mangai gai thi
 When the matter came to light, the principal ordered a departmental inquiry
 uttarakhand main monsoon se pehle hui tabaahi se nibatane main naakaam sabit hue aapadaa prabandhan vibhaag kii chintaa mausam vibhaag ne badha di he
 The Meteorological Department has issued a warning of heavy rain in many areas of the state in the next 48 hours, after which the administration has alerted the district and police administration in all the 13 districts, and has also deployed the NDRF and SDRF
 aapadaa kii drushti se prashasan ne gadhwal mandal ke 6 va kumayun mandal ke 5 atisamvedansheel sthanon par dhyaan kendrit karne ke nirdesh sambandhit adhikariyon ko die hai
 Due to the severity of the situation, where the Chief Secretary took information about the arrangements by videoconferencing with the district and police administration, on Tuesday, in the presence of Army and Air Force officials, a meeting of all departments related to the disaster will be called and preparations will be discussed
 monsoon kii aamad se pehle hi soobe main badal fatne kii aadha darjan se zyada ghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 So far, many people have been killed in these incidents, property worth lakhs of rupees has also been lost to debris and water

 The government is closely watching all these districts
 in sabhi sthanon par esadiaref, andiaref va aapadaa se judi duusari agenciyon ke logon ko tainaat kar diya gaya he
 "therefore, along with alerting the Army and Air Force, a strategy is being chalked out by meeting with top officers of the Army and Air Force on how to deal with adversity
 mukhya sachiv har jile ke aalaa adhikariyon ke saath video conferencig kar unase pal pal kaa apadet le rahe hai
 Efforts are being made to instill confidence in the passengers that they are completely safe on the Char Dham Yatra routes by deploying disaster management teams on the Chardham Yatra routes

 The disaster management department's lethargy in dealing with the devastation caused by the cloudburst has made it clear that much more is yet to be done in the matter of disaster management
 tippaniyan Santosh Badoni, secretary of the state's disaster management department, says, "in all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand, havoc is common in every monsoon season, but in terms of disaster, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Tehri, Pauri, Rudraprayag, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh in the state There are sensitive districts

 i had practiced at Shivaji Park all my life, Achrekar sir (ramakant Achrekar) had his own methods of coaching and training
 us samay gym jane kaa rivaaj nahin tha
 He did not pay much attention to training
 He said, 'for the first half of my career, i did not go to the gym

 pichley hi maheene bijepi se naata todane kaa elaan kar chuke siddhu ke aap se judane kii baat kamobesh pakki maani ja rahi thi
 However, according to sources, last week when Sidhu asked Kejriwal to make him the aap's candidate for the post of CM in the state, the conversation went sour
 sutron ne saath hi bataaya ki 52 varshiya siddhu ne apni patni navjot cor ke liye bhi party se tikat maanga
 Kaur is currently a BJP MLA in Punjab, but she is also likely to join AAP soon
 aap dwaara in maangon ko thukraae jane ke baad siddhu ne sanket die ki vah duusare vikalp talash rahe hai or aise main congress bhi unhen lubhaane kii koshish main jute gai he
 Sources associated with the Congress say that the party has no objection to making Sidhu the future Chief Minister, but after two or three years as Deputy Chief Minister
 tippaniyan The Congress can also give Sidhu or his wife the Lok Sabha seat of Amritsar
 siddhu isi seat se bijepi ke saansad hua karte the, lekin pichley loksabhaa chunaav main party ne unka tikat kaat, arun jetali ko yahaan se khadaa kiya or isi ko lekar siddhu kii party se talkhi paidaa hui
 However, Jaitley was defeated by Congress candidate Captain Amarinder Singh
 amarinder ab rajya congress ke siem ummidavaar hai, to aise main chunaav jeetne par unhen yah seat chhodani hogi
 However, the Congress source says that for all this, Sidhu will first have to come forward for talks, which has not happened yet

 In this connection, AAP leader Ashutosh did not take anyone's name and said, 'our doors are always open to honest leaders, not to those trying to bargain
 agar aap hamase judana chaahate hai, to bina kisi shart ke jude
 With this, he said, 'as far as i know Sidhu has not left the BJP
 ' Sidhu, who had announced his break with the BJP last month, is believed to be more or less sure of joining AAP

 Sources also said that 52-year-old Sidhu also sought tickets for his wife Navjot Kaur from the party
 cor philhal punjab main bijepi kii vidhayak hai, lekin unke bhi jald hi aap main judane kii sambhaavna he
 After AAP rejected these demands, Sidhu indicated that he was looking for other options and in such a situation the Congress was also trying to woo them
 congress se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki siddhu ko bhavi mukhyamantri to nahin, lekin do-teen saal baad upmukhyamantri banane main party ko koi aapatti nahin
 The comments congress siddhu yaa unki patni ko amritsar kii loksabhaa seat bhi de sakati he
 Sidhu used to be a BJP MP from the same seat, but in the last Lok Sabha election, the party cut his ticket, Arun Jaitley was picked up from here and this led to a tussle with Sidhu's party
 haalanki jetali ko congress ummidavaar captain amarinder singh ne haraa diya tha
 Amarinder is now the CM candidate of the state Congress, so he will have to leave this seat if he wins the election

 Experts in a health survey and study have found that people who regularly have physical relationships with their partners lead longer lives than ordinary people

 In contrast, other groups were asked to form regular physical relationships with good food and drink
 kareeb do hafte tak chale is survey ke dauraan pratiyogiyon kii niyamit swasthya jaanch kii gai
 The survey study found that group B, who were allowed to have regular physical relationships, gave better results than group-a during this period
 doctoron kaa maananaa he ki niyamit taur par shaareerik sambandh jahaan ek ore sabase behtareen vyaayaam he, vahiin yah maansik rup se bhi aapako feet rakhata he, jabaki jo log niyamit taur par shaareerik sambandh nahin banaate hai vah kunthagrast ho jate hai
 Not only this, in physical relations, distastefully affects some parts of the brain
 doctoron ke maane to niyamit taur par shaareerik sambandh bananaa lambii umr kaa sutara ho saktaa he
 Also, it is important that the relationship should not only be formed with your partner, but also to improve the relationship

 diwali par dilli or ensiaar main pataakhon ke bechney par ‘pabandi ke bam’ kii gunj sunai hi de rahi thi ki arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne bhi ek ‘sutali bam’ phod diya
 The Delhi government, in its draft report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), has said that it has already banned firecrackers and fireworks on all occasions except festivals with a view to keeping the capital's climate clear
 bikri par pabandi ko lekar pataakhe waalon kii trahimam par supreme court ne to kah diya ki koi ‘crecker free diwali’ nahin ho rahi, logon ne to pehle hi pataakhe kharid rakhe hai, hamane to pabandi hi der se lagaai
 Protests are being held in the streets over the ban on the sale of firecrackers, but it is no rocket science to guess what the fireworks are doing with the backdoor in the streets of Sadar Bazaar and Chandni Chowk
 kehane ko police nigaraanee main juty he, lekin isi sab ke bich aise board bhi dekhne ko mil rahe hai- ‘aage naa jaaen, kaam chal rahaa he

 sirf naaraa mat lagaao, inten lagaana shuru karo
 The Shiv Sena will do the work of offering the urn because the work of the Babri Dome was also done by the Shiv Sainiks

 On the second day of Sahitya Aaj Tak-2019, many celebrities were involved Rajneeta and writer Dilip Pandey and Janhvi Prasad participated in 'sahitya Aaj Tak-2019', the biggest Mahakumbh of church literature, by Rajineta and writer Dilip Pandey and writer Jahnavi Prasad
 sahitya ajtak-2019 ke duusare din yani shanivaar ko donon guest ne gandhi or bacchon ke future par vistaar se baatcheet kii
 Let me tell you that the author Janhvi Prasad has written a book called 'stories of Young Gandhi'
 vahiin, dilip pandey kii 'tapaki or bundi ke laddu' book bacchon par aadhaarit he
 'tapki Aur Bundi Ke Laddu' is the fourth book by Dilip Pandey, which he has written with his friend Chanchal Sharma
 charchaa ke dauraan rajaneta or lekhak dilip pandey ne kaha ki bacchon ko abhaav main jeena sikhaanaa bahut jaruri he
 If children learn to live in the absence, then they will be able to face the difficulties firmly
 yah parents ke liye bhi acha hoga
 If you fulfill every demand of the child, then you will not be able to give them a strong foundation
 unhone kaha ki doremon, chota bhim jaise cartoon ke bich bacchon ko good tach or bed tach ke bare main bhi bataanaa jaruri he
 Children also have to make us aware of our old civilization
 aaj ke bacchon ko varnmaala nahin pataa haiunhone kaha ki aaj ke bachche nataraj pencil, gramophone, reel vaale casette ke bare main shaayad nahin jaanate ho
 Children should also know about the life you have lived
 aaj ke bachche pen drive, hard discs, memory card ke yug main hai
 He said that i want children to know about 80-90s too
 unhone kaha ki hamaare desh main ajukeshan system par bahut kaam karne kii jarurat he
 Today's children do not know about the alphabet because nowadays beauty and money-money have become everything
 ek saadhaaran vyakti mahatma kaise bana ?vahiin, janhvi prasad ne kaha ki hamen samay ke hisaab se chalanaa hoga
 If they do not move with time, they will fall behind
 unhone kaha ki maine apni kitaab 'yuva gandhi kii kahaniyaan' main graphics ke jariye gandhi ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 He said that Gandhi's ideology is discussed in the world
 gandhi ahimsa, swatantraaa or swatchta kii baaten karte the, ye chijen sabko pataa he, lekin ek saadhaaran vyakti kaise mahatma bana, ye jaanane main logon kii dilchaspee kam he
 Janhvi said that i have included such aspects of Gandhi in my book, which are less discussed
 maine graphics ke jariye gandhi ke duusare rup ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 He told that many things related to Gandhiji's life match with mine because his biography is also like that of the common man
 isliye main gandhi ko follow karti hum
 He said that i have tried to convince Gandhi through graphics because people do not have time
 ye kitaab aap do ghante main padhakar khatm kar sakate hai kyonki isamen sabakuch graphics par aadhaarit he
 He said that photo memory has a different importance in our body
 hamen photo ke jariye chizon ko jaldi kaich karte hai
 That is why i have tried to convince Gandhiji through graphics
 maharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke gathbandhan ko bahumat to mil gaya, lekin abhi tak rajya main sarkaar nahin ban pai he
 There was a tussle between the two parties over the chief minister's post, and finally on Friday, Fadnavis submitted his resignation to the governor
 maharashtra vidhansabha kaa vartmaan kaarykaal 9 november ko khatm ho rahaa haior isse ek din pehle hi mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne pad se istipha de diya he
 However, there are options still open for forming a government in the state
 devendra fadanvis or uddhav thakare donon ne apni press conference ke dauraan sarkaar banane kii baat ek baat phir doharaai
 In such a situation, it is clear that government will be formed even if it takes time
 bijepi or shivasena kii mahayuti sarkaar banane main naakaam rahi
 Both parties are still standing at their respective stands
 chunaav parinaamon par najar daalen to janata kaa faisla mahayuti kii sarkaar kaa hi tha aise main rajya main sarkaar gathan ke kuch hi vikalp or bachate hai
 bjp-shiv Sena should be formed The first option for government formation is still with BJP and Shiv Sena
 kyonki yah sarkaar hi ek majboot sarkaar hogi
 But this will not be easy because both the parties are still standing on their stand
 shivasena-ensipi kii sarkarusraa vikalp he ki shivasena ensipi ke saath milakar congress ke samarthan se sarkaar banaae
 The problem with the second option, however, is that the Shiv Sena has been fiercely opposed to both parties
 haalanki jis tarah aaj sharad pavaar or prithviraj chavaan kii mulaakaat hui
 After that it can be said that the Congress is in the mood to form the government but it is not possible without the Shiv Sena
 raashtrapati shashan kaa bhi he vikledgar sarkaar ke gathan ko lekar kuch pragati nahin hoti he to rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii sifarish kar sakate hai
 After this, President's rule will come into force in the state after 9 November
 dobaaraa chunaav kii sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahinantim vikalp yah bhi he ki rajya main raashtrapati shashan ke baad dobaaraa chunaav karaae jaaen
 But this is unlikely because both the big political parties BJP and Shiv Sena are claiming to form their own government
 mumbai main rail kiraayon main badhotaree ko lekar congress virodh pradarshan kar rahi he
 The demonstration has started at the CST station in Mumbai
 railway ne yatri kiraayon main 14 fisadi kii badhotaree kii he
 Around 8 million people use local every day in and around Mumbai
 aise main kiraye main hui badhotaree kaa log kaaphi virodh kar rahe hai
 Angered by the increase in rail fares, the Shiv Sena has launched a scathing attack on the Congress opposing the increase
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha ki congress ko virodh kaa koi haq nahin he, kyonki upie sarkaar main sirf daamon main badhotaree hi hui
 At the same time, Uddhav Thackeray expressed the hope that some solution will be found with the Railway Minister
 rail kiraaye main badhotaree kaa chautarfa virodh jhel rahi sarkaar ke kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne is badhotaree ko logon ke liye bahut hi zaruri bataaya
 He said that the railway is running at a huge loss
 aise main behatar suvidha ke liye ye faisalaa zaruri tha
 Gadkari said that this decision to increase rail fares has been taken to save the existence of railways
 unhone pichhali upie sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki pichley 10 saal main desh main policy paralisis ke halaat utpann ho gaye hai jise qaabu karne ke liye is tarah ke kathor faisale lene honge
 Abhi tak India chup tha
 Ab hum log bolega aur duniya sunega
