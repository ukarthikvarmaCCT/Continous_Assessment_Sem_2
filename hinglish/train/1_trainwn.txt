unhone daawa kiya ki urvarak par jiesti kii kam kii gai dar se gramin kshetra main samruddhi aegi
 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) Sachin Tendulkar has lost his wicket several times by batting defensively in his 100th international century but the veteran Indian is likely to bat in full flow in the fourth and final Test match against Australia
 tendulkar ke saathi khilaadi ne kaha, ‘vah is tarah se taiyaar hai ki keval ek shatak par hi nahin thamane vaale hai
 Once he achieves this feat, he will try to extend that innings further
 sambhavat vah doharaa shatak jadenge
 'tendulkar has so far been less unsuccessful in this tour than his peers
 unhone chah pariyon main 41
 Has scored 249 runs at an average of 50
 lekin mahashatak kaa unka intjaar badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Tendulkar is aware that he often gets out after reaching close to a century due to some reasons
 unhone ab swayan antim test match main shuru se aakhir tak puri swatantraaa ke saath ballebaaji karne kaa man banaaya he
 In the first Test match in Sydney, Tendulkar scored 20 off 24 balls but his next 21 runs were scored on 65 balls
 agali pari main unke shuruaati aath ran 42 gend par bane lekin iske baad unhone apana ravaiya badla or agle 42 ran 48 gend par bana diye
 After this, he again had to play 43 balls to score his last 20 runs
 kai baar aisa duusare chor se wicket girane ke kaaran hota he
 Most of the times this happens when the last of the session or the last moments of the day is in play
 vah naakaam nahin rahe hai lekin unke tareeke se team or vah swayan aahat hue hai
 Certainly the 100th century has been home in Tendulkar's mind, he has not been able to score a century since 19 innings of the last ten Tests
 apane 187 test match ke karier main unhone test shatak ke liye isse lanbaa intjaar kabhi nahin kiya
 This explains why Tendulkar agreed to be part of India's ODI team which will take part in the tri-series next month
 austrailian captain maaikel clark chaahate hai ki vah tendulkar kaa mahashatak tivi par banate hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Meaning that he does not want Tendulkar to achieve this feat on Australian soil, but every Indian cricket lover wishes that Tendulkar achieve this feat in the fourth Test match
 austrailian coach miki arthur bhi tendulkar kaa 100waan shatak banate hue dekhnaa chaahate hai lekin vartmaan daure ke baad
 Looking at the record, Tendulkar has so far scored six centuries in 16 Test matches in Australia and is now wishing another century for the last time

 During this program, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Rahul Gandhi's justice plan that this is a revolutionary step
 vishwa main kahin bhi aisa nahin hua he lekin rahul gandhi ise karke dikhaaenge
 With the thought of making these kinds of decisions, Rahul Gandhi ji has entered the fray, speaking his words with truth in the whole country, not making false promises
 hamaari kathani-kerani main antar nahin he
 He also said that the Congress shows what it says
 rahul gandhi chaahate the ki 10 din main kisaan kaa karja maaf ho, hamane 3-4 din main karje maaf kar die
 BJP talked about loan waiver of 50 thousand rupees, took 8-9 months, we have forgiven most of the debts in a month and a half

 bihar main janata dal (you) or bijepi kaa gathbandhan toote aaj puraa ek maheenaa ho gaya he, lekin ab bhi bijepi ke netaa sarkaar ke aayogon ke pad par baithe huye hai or laal batti kaa majaa le rahe he
 The interesting thing is that the BJP is also speaking out loudly against the Nitish government
 lekin bijepi ayog main sanvaidhanik padon par baithe apane netaaon ko istipha nahin dene kaa nirdesh bhi de rahi he taaki unhen bhi bijepi kii mantriyon kii tarah barkhaast kiya jaye or party ko logon kii sahanubhuti mili
 Rekha Trivedi is a member of the State Women's Commission
 in par gathbandhan tuutane kaa koi asar nahin dikhataa
 She is doing her work in the Commission's office as usual
 rekha kaa kahana he ki wo istipha nahin dengi, agar sarkaar ko barkhaast karnaa he to kare
 Rekha Trivedi, who has such a view, is not alone, but there are many leaders that on one side are attacking the government and on the other hand they are also enjoying the joy of red light and which has the status of ministers of state
 laal batti kaa majaa le rahe netaaon main ye naam pramukh hai-sanjay mayukh, sadsy savarna ayogvimal jain, sadsy bal sarakshan yogramdev prasad yadav, adhyaksh bal shramik ayogbabulal tudu, adhyaksh anusuchit janajati ayogsardaar charan singh, upaadhyaksh alpsankhyak ayogyogendra paswan, upaadhyaksh anusuchit jati yogrenu kushvaha, sadsy rajya mahila ayogchandramukhi, devi sadsy rajya mahila yogrekha trivedi, sadsy rajya mahila ayogmrityujny singh, sadsy kisaan ayoglalita devi, sadsy bal sangrakshan yogramji rishidev, sadsy mahadalit ayoghaalanki kuch log is intjaar main baithe hai ki party kii taraf se koi nirdesh aaye to istipha dene ko bhi taiyaar hai
 Babu Lal Todu is the chairman of the Scheduled Tribes Commission
 unka kahana he ki party kii ore se koi nirdesh nahin aayaa he
 He will resign when he comes to the instructions to resign
 bijepi iske liye bilkul taiyaar nahin he
 The party believes that just as Chief Minister Nitish Kumar sacked 11 BJP quota ministers immediately after separating from the coalition, he should sack those sitting in the commission, so that he can be accused of cheating again
 bijepi ke purv mantri giriraaj singh kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar ji ne naitikta ko apane se koson dur kar liya he
 They have become immoral
 agar mukhyamantri main naitikta hoti to endie ke siem ke rup main shapath lene vaale nitish kumaar ko istipha dena chahie
 Nitish Kumar is silent on this but his ministers are pressurizing the government to sack the BJP leaders sitting in the commission
 bihar sarkaar ke mantri dow
 Bhim Singh said that they are immoral people
 naitikta kii duhai dete hai, lekin apane upar lagu nahin karte
 It is the extent of prostitution that even after being out of government, various commissions, corporations and panels hold different positions
 inako tyaagptr dena chahie, nahin to sarkaar gardaniya passport dekar baahar kar degi
 After the bjp's separation, the leaders of the Janata Dal (U) have been eyeing the posts that belonged to the BJP quota, whether it was a ministerial post or a commission
 yahi vajah he ki lagaataar inhen barkhaast karne kii maang ho rahi he, lekin bijepi sahanubhuti kaa koi mauka chhodana nahin chaahatin
 So it is waiting for when he should be sacked, though Nitish Kumar will take some decision on this after the monsoon session starting on 26 July

 Tejashwi Yadav said that a few hours of rain has disturbed the normal life of the people of Bihar
 unhone, 'gharon, skulon, aspataalon, karyaalayon, bazaar aadi main naaliyon se pani bah rahaa he
 He asked Nitish Kumar, "the Chief Minister should tell if a few hours of rain can be considered an emergency?" He said that the Nitish Kumar government has a habit of blaming the opposition and nature for the failure of its administration
 vahiin isse pehle baadh prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura karte hue siem nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki is tarah kii sthiti kisi ke haath main nahin he

 So far 73 people have died in rain related incidents in Uttar Pradesh

 Interestingly, the child was just one year old when the murder took place

 As the leader of the Janata Parivar, Lalu Prasad on Thursday put forward the name of Jeetan Ram Manjhi against Nitish, on the other hand, there was an answer from the BJP that if Nitish becomes CM, it will be possible only with the help of BJP
 yani jis raajnneetik daal ko gadha banane ke liye chah dalon ne saath milakar 'janata parivaar' kaa jhanda uthaaya, vah vilay ke thik baad khichdi banane kii kagaar par he
 The rage between Laloo Prasad and Nitish Kumar regarding the CM candidate has now come to the fore
 buudhvaar ko jahaan lalu ne press conference main saaf kaha ki mukhyamantri pad kii res main court se bari hone kii sthiti main wo bhi shaamil hai, vahiin guuruuvaar ko twit bam phodkar saaf kar diya ki gathbandhan ke liye tyaag kii bhaavana ke liye sabhi taiyaar rahen

 Nitish Kumar has suffered the most surprise and trouble with this condition
 kyonki abhi tak nitish bihar main janata parivaar ke eklaute sabase bade chehre hai
 Lalu has also made it clear by writing a line on Twitter that it is not possible to get anything without losing in politics
 maanjhi ne kya kahaajtak se khaas baatcheet main bihar me purv mukhyamantri maanjhi ne saaf-saaf kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 At the present time, he does not want to lose any political option
 haalanki maanjhi ne yah jarur kaha ki nitish ke saath gathbandhan kaa vah samarthan nahin karte hai or kisase parhez va kisase prem vah yah abhi nahin bataa sakate
 Earlier, Manjhi also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday
 is sankshipt mulaakaat ke baad se hi maanjhi khush bhi najar aa rahe hai
 After meeting PM, Manjhi said, 'prime Minister told me that the way you keep smiling even in difficult situations, everyone should learn from it
 ' mulaakaat raajnneetik thi, lekin baahar jo sandesh aayaa vah 'muskuraahat' ke rup main thi
 Obviously the signs are many

 -input bhashaa se The release of Shahabuddin, who is among the biggest leaders of Bahubali and RJD, surrounded by dozens of serious charges in Bihar, has created a ruckus
 11 saal baad jail kii charadivari se baahar aakar shahabuddin ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par lagaataar kai jubaani hamale kiye
 At the same time, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was in the Grand Alliance government, kept silence
 isko lekar bijepi ne kai sawaal uthaae hai
 Questioning the Grand Alliance, Union Steel Minister Giriraj Singh demanded stern action against Shahabuddin to save Bihar from CM Nitish Kumar
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar apmaan sahakar bhi kis majaburi main kursi se chipke hai? yah bada sawaal he
 Question- Girirajji, Nitish Kumar has today said that he is deeply saddened by Lalu Prasad's silence on the manner in which Shahabuddin is attacking him or making a statement
 unako bolnaa chahie tha?giriraaj singh - nitishji mere mukhyamantri hai or main unke mantrimandal main rah chukaa hum
 i respect him, but i want to ask Nitishji what is the helplessness? Has the chair become so great for you that you should eat a hundred onions and you are eating a hundred even further
 aapane kaha ki shahabuddin par dobaaraa sisie lag saktaa he
 Is Bihar a priority for you or your honor, your chair? You can stand as the greatest advocate for the prohibition law
 kya bihar ke liye nahin kar sakate
 a criminal because of which many mothers and many wives are stumbling rate by rate
 insaaf ke liye dar-dar bhatak rahe hai
 Did you not find any big lawyer in the court for such a person? The people of the state are watching you with suspicion
 aap kursi kii khatir kadam uthaaenge yaa bihar ke liye kadam uthaaenge
 Question - Giriraj ji, the way Shahabuddin is speaking about Nitish Kumar
 unako kya karnaa chahie? sawaal uth rahe hai ki dobaaraa jangalraj aa gaya, apradhi baahar he
 How do you see all these things? Giriraj Singh - Why should i advise? i was also saying at that time that it is a Bemail coalition at the time of elections
 yah araajaktaa ke saath gathbandhan he
 Today there is Jungle Raj in Bihar
 nitishji uske protection main khadey hai
 It was constituted for the participation of power
 bihar ke bhavishya ke liye nahin hua tha
 Now the people of the country and the people of Bihar want to see this
 kahaan gaya nitish kumaar kaa sushasan, kahaan gaya unke sushasan kaa vah cheharaa? unako bataanaa padegaa ki vah kursi kii khatir samjhauta kar rahe hai
 What is he doing for the humiliation of him and the CM post? bihar ke liye bhi unako kuch karnaa he yaa nahin? Rahul Gandhi will address public meetings in some areas of Gujarat on 24 and 25 November

 About 1 in Chhattisgarh
 80 lakh shikshakarmiyon ko sanvillian kar sarkari shikshak banane ke elaan ke baad rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne congress ke haathon se ek bada mudda chin liya he
 By giving a gift of merger to a large number of education workers, Chief Minister Raman Singh has made a big challenge before the Congress by strengthening his vote bank
 beete 10 saalon se shikshakarmiyon kii sanvillian kii maang sarkaar ke liye gale kii haddi ban gai thi
 However, for this the state government will have to make a separate provision of budget of more than two thousand crore rupees
 darasal sanvillian ke baad shikshakarmiyon ke vetan or bhatton main bees se pachchis fisadi kaa ijapha hoga
 Not only this, they will also become entitled to many government facilities
 rajya main kuch maheene badvidhansabha chunaavhone vaale hai
 Therefore, the decision of the merger of education workers can prove to be a trump card for the BJP government of the state
 congress abhi tak shikshakarmiyon ke andolan ko samarthan dekar apana raajnneetik ullu sidhaa karne main juty thi, lekin raman singh ke is faisle ne uske armaanon par pani pher diya he
 After years of long-pending demand and complete agitation, the Chhattisgarh government has finally fulfilled the demand of years-old merger of education workers
 chhattisgarh ke dedh lakh se zyada shikshakarmiyon ko iskaa sidhaa phayda hoga
 Remaining junior education workers will also come under the purview, but the government has not disclosed when and how
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik aath saal se zyada seva kar chuke sabhi shikshakarmi kaa sanvillian kar unhen sarkari shikshak banaaya jayega
 This will not only increase the salaries of education workers, but will also provide them many government facilities
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle shikshakarmiyon ke sanvillian ko bijepi sarkaar ke trump card ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 According to Chief Minister Raman Singh, a notification will soon be issued to call the cabinet meeting to make education workers government teachers
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne ambikapur main vikaas yatra ke dauraan bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii maujuudagi main manch se shikshakarmiyon ke sanvillian kii ghoshnaa kii he
 In the election year, Chhattisgarh government has played a big bet by taking the decision of merger of education workers
 pradesh main beete kai maheenon se shikshakarmi lagaataar apane sanvillian kii maang ko lekar pradarshan or kai abhiyaan chalaa rahe the
 In these campaigns, a lot of effort was made to pressure the government with the Selfie with Family campaign
 jo kaaphi had tak safal bhi hua
 In this campaign, education workers sent selfies of their family's voters to BJP leaders
 selfi ke saath chetavanee bhi di thi ki sanvillian nahin hua to, prayek parivaar ke aadha darjan vot vipakshi dalon ke khate main jaaenge
 This decision of the government is considered to be a decision taken due to heavy pressure from the education workers
 sanvillian kii ghoshnaa hote hi pradeshbhar main shikshakarmi chowk-chauraahon par jute or ek duusare ko badhai dekar jashn manaaya
 Faridabad, adjoining Delhi, trembled with the sound of the bullet on the day of jashn-e-azadi
 police kii maujuudagi main lagbhag 3 badmaashon ne saream ek trek driver ko goli maar di
 The miscreants shot at National Highway No 2 near Bata Chowk at 4 am and escaped from the spot
 sabase hairat kii baat ye he ki chowk ke paas pulicekarmi bhi tainaat the lekin badmaashon ko maano police kaa koi khauf hi nahin tha
 They came and shot the truck driver and fled from the spot
 is ghatana ke baad aazaadee ke din ko dhooma-dham or suraksha ke saath manaane kaa daawa karne vaali faridabad police ke tamaam vaade-iraade badmaashon ne hawa-hawaii kar die
 The police have registered a case against unknown miscreants and started investigating the case
 trek ke conductor ne bataaya ki wo or driver bata chowk par trek khadaa karke baithe hi the ki badmaashon ne conductor said vaali khidki ko khatkhataya or darwaja kholane ke liye kaha
 After this, the driver refused to open the door and the truck started running and then the miscreants broke the window of the driver-side window and shot the truck driver
 iske baad badmaash maukey se faraar ho gaye
 After the shooting, the conductor put the truck on the side and ran and informed the police standing a short distance away
 iske baad police ne ambulance bulaakar driver ko aspataal bhijwaya
 At the same time, according to the police, they were informed of the incident by Nanhe, the conductor of the truck
 soochna milte hi police turant ghatnasthal par pahunchi or ghayal trek chaalak ko ilaaj ke liye civil aspataal main bhartee karavaaya
 In view of the critical condition of the driver, he was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi
 vahiin, polisbodmashontak pahunchane ke liye aas-paas lage CCTV camaron ko khangaal rahi he or har angal se jaanch kar jald se jald aropiyon giraftaar karne kii baat kah rahi he

 Conflicts are usually mistaken in relationships
 lekin rishte main nok-jhonk hona yaa kisi baat par donon parteners kaa sahamat naa hona swaabhaavik hota he
 In such a situation, if there is a little tip, then it is a sign of good relationship
 ham bataa rahe hai 6 tarah ke ve jhagade jo pragadh prem kii nishaani he
 It is often about the lack of warmth in the relationship that in the beginning we give time to our partner, give love and surprise
 lekin dhire-dhire ye chijen kam ho jaati hai or rishta boring hone lag jaataa he
 In such a situation, you have to hear from the partner that 'you are no longer the same
 ' aap daleel dete hai ki 'kaam bad gaya he' ityadi
 Many a time there is noose
 ye nok-jhonk jaruri hoti he kyonki rishte ke saath jo jimmedaari aati he usase aap bhaag nahin sakate
 So it would be better to love something, do some work
 gharavaalon ko lekar-kai baar taang khinchaai ke liye aapkaa partner aapke ghar waalon kii acting karata he
 It is bound to be angry in such a situation
 aap bhi jawaab main uske ghar waalon kii acting karti hai
 Both tease each other
 ye boriyat bhagane kaa mjedaar tarika he
 However, keep in mind that doing it within a limit should not hurt anyone's mind, otherwise there may be problems in the relationship
 personal spes ko lekar-jivan main har vyakti ko personal spes kii jarurat hoti he
 Sometimes the mind is upset and does not feel like talking to anyone
 chaahe vah partner hi kyon naa ho
 In such a situation, you find it difficult to disturb your personal space of the partner
 aap donon kii ladaai hoti he
 But there is nothing wrong in this
 agar aapkaa man kuch samay akele rahane kaa he to partner kaa man aapako pareshaan karne kaa
 You often forget worry / sorrow in such a fuss
 vaise mood bilkul thik naa ho to thode samay ke liye partner ko akelaa chhod dena chahie
 Later you can 'disturb' them
 motopa kaa ilaaj he alovera, lekin aise karen upyogpaise ko lekar-paise rishte main bahut jaruri hota he
 If your partner is spending extravagantly, it becomes your duty to interrupt him
 lekin kai baar jo chijen aapako phijulkharchi lagati hai ve partner ko jaruri lagati he
 In such a situation there is nozzle
 lekin jis nok-jhonk se thode paise batch jaaen wo jaahirataur par ek achche rishte kii nishaani he
 However, there may be a rift in the relationship with the purposeless Toka-taki

 In the relationship, both should have the right to live their own social life
 doston se milanaa, saathiyon kii party main jane par ladaai hona swaabhaavik he
 It shows that both of you are in love with each other, and you don't want to let his love be shared with a friend

 For the last ten years, a ray of light has started to appear in the life of Abul Bajjandar of Bangladesh suffering from a very strange disease
 is beemaari kii vajah se 26 saal ke abul kii anguliyon par pedo kii chaal jaisi rachanaaen ug ain, jisase unka naam hi 'tree main' pad gaya
 However, the path of his surgery has now been cleared
 doctoron ke mutabik, surgery se ye chaal hat jaaengi to unke sharir se kareeb 5 kilo vajan kam ho jaegaa
 Abul, who hails from the southern district of Khulna in Bangladesh, says that when the growth started on his fingers 10 years ago, he did not know that it would grow so much
 dhire-dhire vah koi bhi kaam karne main asamarth ho gaye
 He now has dozens of 2-3 inch branches in both his hands and also some small growths in his legs
 abul ne shuru main ne khud hi yah growth kaatane kii koshish kii, lekin yah bahut dardanaak tha
 He then took homeopathy and herbal medicines, but this worsened his condition
 unhone bharat ke doctoron se bhi sampark kiya tha, lekin unka parivaar ilaaj kaa kharch uthaane main asamarth tha
 Abul used to run a rickshaw earlier, but due to this disease, he had to leave this job
 ab dhaka medical college hospital (dmasiech) main unka ilaaj hoga, jahaan hospital hi unke ilaaj kaa puraa kharch uthayega
 This surgery will be done in such a way that there is no damage to the veins of Abul's hands
 tippaniyan When 4 years ago, this growth started growing rapidly, Abule showed it to the doctors
 tab pataa chalaa ki vah epidermodysplagia veruciformis ke shikaar ho chuke hai
 It is a very rare genetic skin disorder, which causes skin growth in affected humans like tree roots and branches
 isi vajah se is beemaari ko 'tree main dijis' kehete hai

 bangladesh ke dakshini jile khulanaa ke rahane vaale abul kehete hai ki jab 10 saal pehle unki anguliyon par yah growth shuru hui thi, to unako nahin pataa tha ki yah is kadar bad jaaegi
 Gradually, he was unable to do any work
 ab unke donon haathon main darjanon 2-3 inch kii shakhaaen hai or pairon main bhi kuch choti-choti growth hai
 Abul initially tried to cut this growth on his own, but it was very painful
 tab unhone homeopathy or herbal dawaaen leen, lekin isse unki condishan or bighad gai
 He had also contacted doctors in India, but his family was unable to afford the treatment
 abul pehle rickshaw chalaane kaa kaam karte the, lekin is beemaari kii vajah se unhen yah kaam chhodana pad gaya
 Now he will be treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH), where only the hospital will bear the full cost of his treatment
 yah surgery is tarah kii jaaegi ki abul ke haathon kii nason ko koi nuksaan na ho
 The comments 4 saal pehle yah growth jab teji se badhani shuru hui to abule ne doctoron ko dikhaaya
 It was then revealed that he had succumbed to epidermodisplasia varusiformis
 yah ek bahut hi rer genetic skin disorder he, jisase prabhavit insaan main ped kii jadon or shakhaon kii tarah skin growth hone lagati he
 For this reason, this disease is called 'tree man disease'

 In 2008, a human suffering from the same disease was operated in a village in Indonesia

 rajyasabha ne desh main sadak durghatnaon main kami laane ke makasad se buudhvaar ko sadak suraksha ke liye kathor praavdhaanon vaale motor yaan (sanshodhan) vidheyak-2019' ko manjuuri de di
 The Rajya Sabha passed the bill by 108 votes against 13 after discussion
 vidheyak par laaye gayi vipakshi sadasyon ke sanshodhan prastaavon ko dhvanimat se khaarij kar diya gaya
 The bill was passed in the Lok Sabha last week, but due to 'some minor printing error', the government had to bring three amendments to fix it
 in sanshodhano ke kaaran ab yah vidheyak phir se loksabhaa main jayega
 Responding to the discussion on the Bill in the Upper House, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari made it clear that the government has no intention of interfering with the states' rights through the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill
 iske praavdhaanon ko lagu karnaa rajyon kii marji par nirbhar he or centre kii koshish rajyon ke saath sahyog karne, parivahan vyavastha main amulchul badlaav laane or durghatnaon ko kam karne kii he
 The bill contains very stringent provisions aimed at reducing road accidents
 kishor naaballigon dwaara vaahan chalaanaa, bina license, khatarnaak dhang se vaahan chalaanaa, sharaab pikar gaadi chalaanaa, nirdhaarit seemaa se tej gaadi chalaanaa or nirdhaarit maanakon se adhik logon ko baitaakar athwa adhik maal ladakar gaadi chalaane jaise niyamon ke ulanghan par kade jurmaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 It also proposed a penalty for not giving way to emergency vehicles like ambulances
 gadakari ne kaha ki vidheyak ke praavdhaan 18 rajyon ke parivahan mantriyon kii siforeeshon par aadhaarit hai
 These recommendations were also examined in detail by the Standing Committee of Parliament and based on its report, they have been included in the Bill
 tej gaadi chalaane, bina beemaa policy ke vaahan chalaane or bina helmet ke vaahan chalaane par jurmaana evam nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye license nilambit kiya jane ke praavdhaan vidheyak main shaamil hai
 In case of any crime on the road by the teenager, the owner or guardian of the vehicle will be held guilty and registration of the vehicle will also be canceled
 is vidheyak main centre sarkaar ke liye motor vaahan durghatana kosh ke gathan kii baat kahi gai he jo bharat main sadak kaa upyog karne waalon ko anivaary beemaa cover pradaan karegaa
 The bill provides for heavy penalties for violation of traffic rules
 vidheyak par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue gadakari ne kaha, ‘rajyon ke adhikaar main koi dakhal nahin diya jayega
 States that want to implement its provisions, do what they do not want
 hamaara ruukh sahyog karne kaa rahegaa
 Gadkari said that in the event of the purchase of vehicles, giving the registration work to the dealer will not cause any loss of revenue to the states as the tax money will be directly deposited in the account of the state governments through online method
 is sambandh main kar kii dar kaa nirdhaaran bhi rajya apane hisaab se kar sakate hai
 Gadkari said that with the help of private investment with new technology and innovation, extensive improvement is being done in the transport sector
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar electric bason ko sanchalit karne kii koshish kar rahi he jo aam logon ke liye kifayati hone ke saath bahut suvidhajanak rahegi
 Union Minister Gadkari said that a lot of money is needed in the transport sector
 centre or rajyon ke paas paise nahin hai
 In such a situation, investment from private sector will have to be brought at low interest
 gadakari ne kaha ki desh main sadakon par 14 hajaar se adhik ‘blike spot' kaa pataa chalaa he or iske liye 14 hajaar karod rupaye kii pariyojna banaayi gayi he
 It will be implemented with the help of World Bank and Asian Development Bank
 unhone kaha ki sadakon sahit samoochee parivahan vyavastha ko antarrashtriya maanakon ke anuroop banane ke liye nayi sadak parivahan niti kaa prastaav he
 Under this, the transport system will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology and will be made according to the convenience and safety of the passengers
 gadakari ne kaha ki iske tahat desh main pehali baar ski bas chalaane kii yojana he
 Environmentally friendly and affordable bus service will start from Delhi's Dhaula Kuan to Manesar in Haryana
 unhone spasht kiya ki desh main sadak haadason ke liye sadak nirmaan kii khamiyaan jimmedaar hai
 For this, accountability of road construction company and engineers will be fixed
 gadakari ne sweekaar kiya ki bataur mantri pichley paanch saalon main unki ekmaatr naakaami sadak haadason main kami nahin laa paanaa he
 He said that despite all efforts, he could not bring down the road accidents as expected
 is sambandh main tamilnadu ne bahut acha kaam kiya he or iskaa ham puure desh main anukaran karenge
 The Union Minister also said that those who do not fulfill dreams by fulfilling them, the people change them, but those who fulfill them, the people choose them again
 gadakari ne kaha ki desh main 22 lakh vaahan chaalkon kii kami he
 In order to meet the shortage of trained drivers, the initiative has been taken to open driving training centers in small cities
 iske liye kendra sarkaar rajyon ko prati kendra ek karod rupee anudaan degi

 On the other hand, Suresh Raina has so far scored only 768 runs in 31 innings of 18 Test matches in his career
 suresh raina kaa ye haal tab he jab unhone apane test kariyar ke pehali hi pari main joardaar shatak banaaya tha
 Suresh Raina scored 120 runs in the first innings of the 2010 debut Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo
 kariyar kii duusari pari main 62 or teesri pari main raina ke note out 41 ran the
 He scored 86 runs in the fourth Test innings
 paanchavin pari main unhone pehali baar shunya banaaya or uske baad 31 test pariyon tak pahunchane main suresh raina aath baar shunya par hi out ho chuke hai
 Apparently, Suresh Raina, who has played more than 200 odis, is on the way to finish before the start of his Test career and no one other than Suresh Raina himself is responsible for this

 For eight years, he and his entire family lived around the knees with traitors, terrorists, murderers and unaware
 jeeta kya rahaa, yun kahen jinda rahane kii sajaa paakar jite ji marataa rahaa
 He was lonely behind bars for eight years to say, but in reality the whole family was being imprisoned
 beshak iljaam sirf uske sar or sajaa us ek akele ko mili thi
 But the whole house was facing the punishment of his sentence
 aath saal tak tohamat, jillat, takalif, tangi, ninsaphi, dard or aansuon ke sailaab main uske ghar ne har wo ranj or rang dekhe jo kisi kii bhi jindagi badrang kar sakati he
 Now those bad days have passed, so can anyone return them on the good days of those eight years? It is often said that most people who are uneducated go on the wrong or misguided path
 kyonki mana jaataa he ki aise logon ko gumraah karnaa aasaan hota he
 But when the first class graduate Mohammad Wasif Haider with Physics and Maths was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police in 2001, everyone was shocked
 akhabaaron main kaha gaya ki desh main itnaa padhaa-likhaa aatankwaadi pehali baar giraftaar hua he
 Wasif Haider, who worked in an American company, was accused of bomb blasts, treason and murder
 mohammad vasif haidar kaa bachapan asia kaa manchester kahe jane vaale kanpur shahar ke chote se mohalle chamanganj main gujara
 From childhood, he was fond of reading and writing, hobby also got reward

 Hyder was living a happy life at home with parents, wife and three small daughters
 sab kuch acha-acha tha, lekin sirf tab tak jab tak ki 30 july 2001 kii wo manahuus raat uske ghar par nahin utari thi
 One night changed the world of Hyder and his entire house
 us raat ke baad savera to kai baar hua par haidar kii jindagi kaa savera usase ruuth chukaa tha
 It was late in the night that the family members did not know who took their son away
 wo to ek din baad jab haidar kanpur ke akhabaaron kii hedline bana tab duniyaavaalon ke saath-saath haidar ke gharavaalon ko pataa chalaa ki haidar ko uthaane vaale koi or nahin police thi
 'three ISI agents arrested from Chamanganj' Actually police had arrested two more boys along with Hyder
 lekin abhi tak khabar bas yahi thi ki teenon pakistani khufia agency iesai ke agent hai
 Hyder and his associates were brought to Delhi immediately after the arrest
 iske baad agle teen dinon tak jo kuch hua use sirf yaad karne bhar se haidar aaj bhi sihar uthta he
 In the name of third degree, he was tortured in such a way that Hyder kept breaking
 giraftaar ke baad haidar ko puure teen dinon tak gaiyrkanoonee dhang se police hiraasat main rakhaa gaya
 During this period, not only the plain papers were signed
 balki third degree ke jariye baqayada camere par jabaran usase bayaan liya gaya
 Delhi Police's Special Cell recorded Haider's confession in police custody on camera
 haalanki haidar ko 30 july kii raat hi uthaa liya gaya tha
 But Delhi Police presented him in court for the first time on 3 August 2001
 baad main chargeshit main police ne sabase ahm saboot ke taur par haidar kaa vahi bayaan jaj sahab ko dikhaaya jo police hiraasat main jabaran usase camere par kahalwaya gaya tha
 The story that the police had prepared in the charge sheet was that Hyder had taken training in Kashmir and he works for Hizbul Mujahideen
 haidar ko police ne akele giraftaar nahin kiya tha
 a total of 23 people were then picked up from across the country in the name of the Terror Module
 inamen teen-chaar haidar ke dost the
 After his arrest, Haider stayed in Tihar Jail in Delhi, Naini Jail in Allahabad and Kanpur Central Jail
 shuru ke chaar-paanch saal tak haidar ko jail ke hai security ward main bilkul alag-thalag rakhaa gaya
 Even in the beginning, he was not allowed to meet the family members
 udhar haidar jail main tha or idhar ghar kii mali haalat lagaataar khasta hoti ja rahi thi
 If there was a possibility of being a terrorist on the forehead, even the relatives left the relatives
 aise vakt main bhi kuch dost aise the, jinhone haidar kaa saath nahin choda
 Those friends took responsibility for the expenses of studying the ration of the house to the daughters of Hyder
 doston ne dosti kaa haq adaa kiya
 But the terror of the terrorist on the forehead of the father was not giving up
 skool main haidar kii betiyon ko daakhila to mil gaya, lekin un bacchiyon ko bhi taane maare gaye
 He could not become a friend in school
 sab unase dur rahete the
 Is eid-bakrid, what is marriage? sari khushiyaan haidar ke ghar se dur ho chuki thim
 Hyder's daughters could not participate in the school's yearbook simply because they did not have the money to buy a dress worth eight hundred rupees and did not want to put any more burden on their friends
 jab haidar jail gaye the tab unki teen betiyaan thim
 The biggest was five years, the second four years and the third one and a half years
 vakt bitta ja rahaa tha
 On the other hand, Haider's life in the jail was decreasing and the daughters' age was increasing in the house
 vakt ke saath haidar par lagaae gaye jurmon kaa bahi-khaat bhi badhata gaya
 Now, the trial begins in connection with three treason, 11 blasts, murder of ADM and recovery of 65 kg of RDX on Haider
 jail me rahane ke dauraan vasif haidar ne kanoon ke kitabon kii padhai shuru kar di
 Hyder felt that no one else could better advocate his case
 lihaaja kanoonee kitaab pard-padhakar wo apane vakil kii cese main madad karne laga
 The hard work of Hyder and his lawyer started showing color
 haidar ke sir jitne bhi dhamaake karne ke iljaam the wo saare jhuthe nikle
 Their police witnesses testified against the police
 aatankwaadi sanghathan ke saath bhi haidar kaa rishta sabit nahin ho paaya
 The biggest charge the police had made against Hyder was the recovery of 65 kg of RDX from him
 lekin kamaal dekhie ki police kabhi wo 65 kilo ardex adaalat ko dikhaa hi nahin saki
 Wasif was now acquitted of the whole case of terrorism
 bas ek kanpur ke ediem ke katl kaa maamla baaki bachaa tha
 Actually there was a riot in Kanpur on 17 March 2000
 us dange ke dauraan ediem city kii goli lagane se maut ho gai thi
 An ADM assistant was also injured in the shootout
 is maamle main dangai ke taur par vasif haidar ko police ne giraftaar kiya tha
 But later in the court, the same ADM assistant gave a statement that the gunman was not Waif Haider
 lihaaza is maamle main bhi vasif bari ho gaya
 Now he was an independent Indian
 aath lambey saal jail main kaatane ke baad swatantraaa diwas se teen din pehle 12 agast 2009 kii raat vasif apane ghar pahunchaa
 He did not inform the family about his arrival
 haidar kii ghar vaapasi ke baad ab unki betiyaan fakhr se kahati hai ki mere paas bhi abba hai
 The happiness that was away from this house for eight years has now returned
 haidar kii ek shikaayat media se bhi he
 According to Hyder, it is the media due to which he is unemployed even after release
 lekin adaalat se bari hone ke baavjood ab bhi mali taur par haidar ke ghar kii haalat nahin badali
 Perhaps the society still did not accept him
 uske paas naukari nahin he
 The police of the country had made Wasif Haider a terrorist and the law of the country declared him innocent
 cese khatm ho janaa chahie tha par aisa nahin hua
 Of course in legal papers, the word terrorist has been removed from his name
 par hamaare samaaj or samaaj ke logon ke jehan se hatana abhi baaki he
 So Hyder is still fighting after his release from court

 durghatana ke chaar din baad hi kishor aaropee 18 saal kaa ho gaya tha
 Senior advocate KTS Tulsi told the news agency Bhasha that Juvenile Justice (child Care and Protection Act 2015) has come into force from January 1, 2016
 aise menaaropee kishoravaahan chaalak ke khilaaf vayask ke rup main sunwaayee honi chahie yaa nahin, is par jejebi ko hi faisla karnaa chahie
 Elaborating on the legal process, he said that for the juvenile trial as an adult, the board would make a preliminary assessment on whether the offense was heinous or not
 aaropee kii samaj or vayaskta kaa str tha yaa nahin
 Rajya Sabha member Tulsi said that the fact that her age was just four days less than 18 years at the time of the incident would affect the decision on her level of understanding
 kyonki samaj kaa str dhire dhire prakriya se viksit hota he, achaanak vayask hone par nahin
 Senior advocate Geeta Luthra also agreed
 unhone apni raay vyakt karte hue samachar agency bhashaa se kaha ki board ke saamne maamla aane ke baad board aparaadh kii shrenee par faisla karegaa or usee ke anuroop aaropee ke khilaaf sunwaayee hogi
 However, Advocate Anant Asthana, an advocate of juvenile law, targeted the media for unnecessarily exacerbating the case due to the running of the accused chemists

 Input IANS maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke helicopter haadase ke baad ghatnasthal par jo sabase pehle pahunchaa, vah na police thi, na koi prashasnic adhikari
 
 
 The first to reach there was Irfan, who very cleverly helped the Chief Minister to come out from the grounded helicopter
 
 
 nilanga main kabad kaa kaarobaar karne vaale irfan shaikh kii dukaan ke paas hi helipad bana tha
 
 
 Ending the local tour on Thursday, when the Chief Minister flew from Nilanga to Latur, Irfan was eagerly eyeing his flying helicopter from near his shop, because the arrival of a helicopter in a small village like Nilanga would be an attraction
 Only
 
 
 lekin, achaanak hi maahaul badal gaya
 
 
 Irrfan saw the helicopter coming towards the ground in front of his eyes and later also heard a very loud sound, after which he ran in the same direction, while the others were running in the opposite direction to avoid the fan and the flying dust
 
 
 mauka-e-vaardaat par pahunchakar irfan ne tapaak se helicopter kaa darwaja kholane kii koshish kii
 
 
 Chief Minister Fadnavis gestured to Irfan from within and then he opened the lock from inside and exited the door
 
 
 darasal, zamin kii taraf aate hue helicopter ke bijli kii taron se chhu gaya tha, or phir dhadaam se zamin par girakar dhans gaya tha, so, aise main daravaaza kholane main chunauti mahasoos ho rahi thi
 
 
 With the help of Irfan, the Chief Minister was able to get out, and as soon as he came out, he told Irfan that he was safe, and Irfan evacuate the other stranded people
 
 
 tippaniyan In a conversation with NDTV India, Irfan said that after this, he started evacuating people trapped inside
 
 
 mukhyamantri bhi baahar aakar irfan se baat karne ke baad helicopter se chand foot duuri par jaakar ruk gaye or baaki yatriyon, payalat ko baahar nikaale janaa dekhne lage
 
 
 After a few moments the administrative staff reached out to the Chief Minister's help, and surrounded them and took them away from the place of the accident
 
 
 jab NDTV india ne irfan se sawaal kiya ki vah baakiyon se ulat disha main helicopter kii ore kyon daude the, to unka jawaab tha, "hamaara raja andar fansaa tha
 
 
 "asked if he wants to meet CM now, Irrfan said," No, our king survived, that's enough for me
 
 
 " is is ghatana kii mukhyamantri karyaalay se bhi pushti kii gai he
 
 
 The helipad was built near the shop of Irfan Sheikh, a junk businessman in Nilanga
 
 
 guuruuvaar ko sthaneey daura khatm kar jab mukhyamantri ne nilanga se latur ke liye udaan bhari, to irfan apni dukaan ke paas se hi utsukathavash unke udate helicopter ko nihaar rahaa tha, kyonki nilanga jaise chote-se gaanv main kisi helicopter kaa aana aakarshan kaa vishay hoga hi
 
 
 But, suddenly the atmosphere changed
 
 
 irfan ne apni ankhon ke saamne helicopter ko zamin kii taraf aate dekha or baad main behad oonchi awaz bhi suni, jiske baad vah usee disha main daud padaa, jabaki baaki log ghoomte pankhe or udati dhul se bachane ke liye ulat disha main bhaag rahe the
 
 
 Arriving on the occasion, Irfan tried to open the door of the helicopter from Tapak
 
 
 mukhyamantri fadanvis ne bheetar se irfan ko ishaara kiya or phir vah andar se lock kholkar darvaaze se nikle
 
 
 In fact, coming towards the ground was touched by the electric wires of the helicopter, and then fell down on the ground and fell, so the challenge was felt in opening the door
 
 
 irfan kii madad se mukhyamantri baahar nikal sake, or unhone baahar aate hi irfan se kaha ki vah surakshit hai, or irfan baaki fanse hue logon ko nikaalen
 
 
 The comments NDTV india se baatcheet main irfan ne bataaya ki iske baad vah andar fanse logon ko nikaalane main jute gaye
 
 
 The chief minister also came out and talked to Irfan and stopped a few feet away from the helicopter and the rest of the passengers, the pilot, were seen getting fired
 
 
 kuch hi pal ke baad prashasnic amala mukhyamantri kii madad ke liye pahunch gaya tha, or unhen gherkar haadase kii jagah se dur le gaya
 
 
 When NDTV India questioned Irfan as to why he had run towards the helicopter in the opposite direction from the rest, his reply was, "our king was trapped inside
" 
 
 " yah puche jane par ki kya vah ab CM se milanaa chaahate hai, irfan ne kaha, " nahin ji, hamaara raja batch gaya, yahi mere liye kaaphi he
 
 
 "this incident has also been confirmed from the Chief Minister's office

 For the last two days, the Twitter war between Punjab Congress chief Captain Amarinder Singh and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is going on in the wake of the upcoming Punjab elections
 darasal buudhvaar ko aam aadmi party (aap) ne dilli ke rajouri garden se vidhayak jaranel singh ko punjab main mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf khadey karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Jarnail will fight against Parkash Singh Badal from the long assembly seat
 paramparaagat rup se badal vahiin se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 However, Prakash Singh Badal's party Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has not announced his candidature from this seat
 lekin paramparaagat rup se unke isi seat se chunaav ladane ke kaaran mana ja rahaa he ki vah yaheen se chunaav ladenge
 The comments aap kii is ghoshnaa ke baad captain amarinder singh ne buudhvaar ko hi twitor par morcha kholte hue kejariwal par aarope lagaaya ki aap dwaara is seat se jaranel singh ko khadaa karne kaa matlab he ki aap ne badal ke saath sathganth kar lee he
 Actually Amarinder believes that Jarnail is a weak candidate against Chief Minister Badal
 Jarnail’s nomination bid from Lambi shows AAP-SAD collusion to ensure Badal’s victory

 divangat congress netaa arjuna singh kii jald hi jari hone ja rahi aatmakatha ‘e grain of sand in da howerglass of time’ main yah baat kahi he
 Singh said that he was confronted with the 'gruesome politics' face after hearing Rao's response to the suggestion of making Sonia Gandhi the president
 383 pannon vaali is kitaab kaa prakaashan he house india ne kiya he or iske sah lekhak ashok chopra he
 Chopra said that Singh had died on March 4 and at that time he was writing his autobiography
 chopra ne kaha ki unhone singh ke parivaar ke sadasyon, anya mitron or sahyogiyon ke saath baatcheet karke jo chijen ve nahin likh paye the unhen puri vishwasaneeyata ke saath likhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Singh said that Rao remained silent for some time after listening to our suggestion, during which his face looked very serious
 unhone kaha, ‘achaanak vah krodh ke saath baras pade or lagbhag chillaakar kaha kya yah aavashyak he ki congress ko ek train ke rup main liya janaa chaiye jahaan dibbon ko nehru gandhi parivaar ke ek ingine se jude rahanaa hoga yaa anya vikalp bhi hai? main raav kii pratikriya sunakar hakkaa bakka rah gaya lekin chup rahaa
 Singh said that the then AICC treasurer Sita Ram Kesari took the matter forward and insisted that 'if we propose to give this post of Congress president to Sonia, it will be fine
 ’kitaab main daawa kiya gaya he ki raav ne yah mahasoos kiya ki unhone bahut jald bahut zyada bol diya he or apni nehru virdohi bhaavana spasht rup se ujagar kar di he
 She then thoughtfully asked, 'there is no harm in giving this suggestion but will she accept it? We did not have an answer to his question because we would have to ask Sonia Gandhi to become the president and take his response
 ’is sambandh main singh ne kaha ki sabase pehle congress netaa vicent george, em el photedaar or swayan unhone kesari se kaha
 Arjun said that Kesari was not surprised by his candidate's choice and agreed to support Sonia
 arjuna ne apni kitaab ke ‘ayodhya main vivaadaaspad dhaancha giraaye jane or uske asar’ khand main kaha ki babari masjid giraaye jane kii khabar aane ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ne khud ko apane kamare main band kar liya or yah drishy kuch aise lag rahaa tha jaise jab rome jal rahaa tha tab nero bansuri baja rahaa tha
 Singh said in his book that he called the Prime Minister's residence in the afternoon on December 6, 1992 to talk about the demolition, "I was told that he would not talk to anyone
" ’unhone kaha, ‘maine jawaab dene vaale vyakti se poocha ki kya vah dilli se baahar hai? is par usne kaha ki vah dilli main hai lekin unhone khud ko kamare main band kar liya he or kaha gaya he ki unhen kisi bhi paristhiti main pareshaan nahin kiya jaye
 'arjun Singh was in Muktsar, Punjab at that time
 arjuna singh ne kaha, ‘mere vichaar se yah drishy kuch usee tarah se tha jaise ki rome ke jalane ke dauraan nero bansuri baja rahaa tha
 i took permission from my host and immediately left for Delhi
 ’unhone kaha ki jaise hi khabar mujhe mili mere mastishk main dhaancha giraaye jane kii tasveere banane lagi
 Arjun said, 'I felt that the tragic result of this incident cannot be calculated in the history of the country
 ’singh ne kaha, ‘bharat kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi ko gambhir nuksaan pahunchaa
 Singh said that on December 6, 1992, a day before the structure was demolished, he had told Rao that the mosque could be demolished but his attitude felt as if he was not taking the whole matter seriously
 ’ Today is the first solar eclipse of the year on Sunday
 shaam ke 5:40 baje yah surya grahan shuru hoga or raat ke 10:01 minute tak rahegaa
 It will be partially visible in India
 jabaki dakshin america, dakshin africa, prashanth, atlantic, or hind mahaasaagar main ise purna rup main dekha ja sakegaa
 Explain that solar eclipse is an astronomical event, and this event only happens when the moon passes between the Sun and the Earth
 shaastra main kuch aise kaam bataae gaye he jo grahan ke samay nahin karnaa chahie
 If you do these things then you may have to go through many troubles
 jaaniye, grahan ke samay koun se kaary nahin karne chahie
 With which we can avoid many troubles
 - grahan ke samay sharir par tel se maalish na karen
 Massage with oil at the time of solar eclipse is believed to cause skin diseases
 -grahan ke samay garbhvatee mahilaon ko vishesh dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They should not get out of the house at the time of eclipse
 unhen bhagwaan kaa naam japana chahie jisase garbh main pal rahe shishu par koi bura prabhaav na pade
 - When the eclipse is felt, one should not touch the idol of God
 iske saath hi sona, bhojan bananaa or khaanaa aadi kaary nahin karne chahie
 - The husband and wife should stay away from Kamkrida at the time of eclipse
 shastron main mana jaataa he ki is samay garbhadhaaran karne se paidaa hua baccha buraaiyon se lipt hota he
 -when an eclipse occurs, eat it before that
 uske baad doodh, dahi or khaane kii chizon main durva yaa tulsi ke pattey daal den
 Doing so does not affect eclipse in food items
 grahan khatm ho jane ke baad ghar kii saaf-safai karen or swayan bhi snaan karen
 After that, donations should be given to the needy
 ab sirf pehle bachche ke liye hi maatrutiv laabh degi modi sarkaar!-grahan ke samay bhajan-kirthan, guru mantra kaa jaap, puja-paath aadi karnaa chahie
 This gives spiritual strength and the effect of eclipse is less
 lekin is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki pratimaa pujan na karen
 How long will the eclipse be seen in India? The solar eclipse, which starts at 5
40 pm on Sunday, can be seen for the first time in India at 6
45 pm for the first time in the evening
 surya grahan raat ke 8 bajkar 28 minute par apni adhiktam avasthaa main hoga, lekin bharat main is samay raat ho chuki hoti he isli yah yahaan dikhaai nahin degaa
 Such an astronomical position of the sun will be only 1 minute 22 seconds
 raat 10 bajkar 01 minute par surya grahan puri tarah se khatm ho jayega
 During the eclipse of scientific recognition, the North and South poles of the Earth are affected
 isliye yah avadhi rinatmak maani jaati he
 Ultraviolet rays are released from the Sun, which affects the enzyme system, so caution is needed during solar eclipse
 nangi ankhon se nahin dekhnaa chahie surya grahasoorya grahan ko kabhi bhi nangi ankhon se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 To see this, only scientifically certified telescope should be used
 surya grahan ko dekhne ke liye vaise chashmen kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jinamein ultrawoilet kirnon ko rokane kii kshamta ho
 This year, four eclipses, tell us that this year we will see four eclipses in the sky
 saal kaa pehla aanshik surya grahan hindustan main 26 farvari 2017 ko yani ki aaj dekhne ko milegaa
 Whereas the first lunar eclipse of 2017 has already taken place on 11 February 2017
 is saal doosraa aanshik chandra grahan agast 7 ko hoga, jabaki duusare surya grahan kaa khagoleey yoga 21 agast 2017 ko he
 The solar eclipse occurring on 26 February is partial, so this eclipse will not be visible in India

 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne 26 janvari ko chif guest ke taur par bharat aane kaa nyotaa swikaarne ke baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko phone kiya
 In a telephonic conversation Nawaz Sharif appealed to Obama to raise the Kashmir issue during his visit to India
 'don online' main chhapi khabar ke mutabik, navaj sharif ne kaha ki kashmir mudde par bharat ke saath baatcheet se kshetra main shanti, sthirataa or aarthik sahyog ko badhaava milegaa
 The seriousness of the case can be gauged from the fact that Obama did not even wait to reach the Oval Office to talk to Sharif
 obama las vegas ja rahe the or unhone air force van se hi pakistani piem se phone par baat kii
 This phone call of the US President is being seen as 'damage Control', because Pakistan has been talking about equality with India from the beginning
 aise main swaabhaavik he ki pakistan ko obama ke is daure se pareshaani hogi
 From the information given by the Pakistani State Department, it seems that he is feeling isolated
 isamen kaha gaya he ki america raashtrapati se sharif kii baat hui
 The two leaders discussed the subject of mutual relations and regional peace
 is dauraan sharif ne obama se bharat ke saaman kashmir kaa mudda uthaane kii guzarish bhi kii
 It is worth noting that during the conversation, Sharif also reminded Obama of the invitation given to visit Washington in Pakistan last year
 is par obama ne kaha ki vah jald hi pakistan kaa daura karenge
 The important point here is that even though the Pakistan State Department is claiming that Obama has promised to come to Pakistan, there is no mention in the White House statement
 gauratlab he ki jorge dablyoo bush 2006 main pakistan ke ek divasiy daure par aae the
 After that Obama took charge of the White House in January 2009, but he has not yet visited Pakistan
 pakistan ko dikkat is baat kii he ki obama duusari baar bharat aa rahe hai, vah afghanistan bhi ja chuke hai, lekin abhi tak islamabad nahin aae hai
 By the way, Obama has gone to Pakistan when he studied in college
 obama kai kaaryakramon main apane us kai hafton kii pakistan yatra kaa zikr kar chuke hai, lekin raashtrapati banane ke baad vah kabhi pakistan nahin gaye
 So far, these US presidents have come to visit India: - Dwight d Eisenhower was the first US President who visited India
 vah 1959 main nai dilli aae the
 Richard Nixon was the second US President to visit India
 unhone 1969 bharat kaa ekadivasiy daura kiya tha
 Jimmy Carter became the third President to visit India
 vah janvari 1978 main teen divasiy daure par aae the
 After the visit of Carter, indo-us relations went through a very bad phase and no American President came to New Delhi for 22 years
 1978 ke baad varsh 2000 main bill clinton bharat aane vaale chauthe raashtrapati bane
 - George W
 Bush visited India in 2006 after Bill Clinton
 -maujuuda america raashtrapati baraak obama 26 janvari ko duusari baar bharat aaenge
 Earlier, he visited India in 2010
 obama pehle america raashtrapati hai, jo apane kaarykaal ke dauraan duusari baar bharat aa rahe hai

 purv sainikon ne somvaar se kramik bhukh hadtaal par jane kii chetavanee di he
 Parrikar also spoke of not tolerating acts of terrorism at all, citing concerns about national security
 rashtriya suraksha main laaparvaahee bardaasht nahinunhone kaha, 'aapse ek gilaas gir saktaa he, lekin aap kisi bachche ko nahin giraate kyonki aap puri satarkta baratate hai or yah soch hoti he
 The day you decide not to let the glass fall, you will never drop it
 rashtriya suraksha se sambandhit maamalon main katai bardaasht nahin karne kii pravriti hi ekmaatr samaadhaan he or yahi soch honi chahie
 The Defense Minister, while indirectly referring to the action of the Simapar army in Myanmar after an ambush attack in Manipur a few days ago, said, "A recent incident has changed the landscape of national security and a change in the way people think
" 
 'parrikar ne kaha ki aantarik adchanon ke kaaran rashtriya suraksha khatre main pad sakati he
 He said that external issues could also threaten national security as happened during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 when the people of that country immigrated to India to escape genocide
 sibar aparaadh badi chunautiparrikarne sibar aparaadhon ko raksha balon ke liye nai chunauti bataaya
 He said, "if there is a cyber attack or cyber terrorism, there can be a danger on the border or it can turn into a war
 haalanki unhone raksha websiton kii hekking kii vajah se kisi tarah ke suraksha sambandhi khatre kii ashanka ko khaarij kar diya kyonki sabhi mahatvapurn jaankaree cloud aadhaarit he or is tarah kii ghuspaith se puri tarah surakshit he
 Parrikar described the problem of fake currency and economic terrorism as more dangerous than cyber attacks

 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kerala ke ldf nit sarkaar par ‘ghotaalon evam bhrashtachar’ main lipt hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 He also said that the ideology and principles of the Marxist Communist (CPI-M) have declined
 unhone haripad main yojit chunaav sabha main kaha ki ldf ke shasankaal ke dauraan makapa dwaara sadaiv aadhunikeekaran evam vikaas kii ore agrasar hone kaa virodh karne ke chalate kerala sabhi kshetron main pichad gaya he
 Significantly, from here, Ramesh Chennithala, the chairman of the Kerala Pradesh Pradesh Committee is contesting the elections

 This government is steeped in corruption
 yahaan ghotaale par ghotaale hue, sharaab, bhoomi or latary ke mafiaon ko sarkaar kaa sangrakshan praapt he jo gramin ilaakon main apni satta chalaa rahe hai
 Gandhi said that the CPI (M) has also been opposed to all forms of modernization
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki kis tarah se makapa tractor or computer ke prayog kaa purv main virodh kar chukaa he
 He said that despite the global economic slowdown, the Indian economy did not come in the recession
 lekin kerala ko ldf shasankaal ke dauraan kaaphi jhelana padaa
 Gandhi said that in the year 2004 the LDF government of the tsunami affected areas completely ignored

 He said, 'can LDF care about you? You have to answer this
 ’ He said that the SPG security of former PM Manmohan Singh was also removed, but there was no such anger in the Congress about the removal of security of Gandhi family

 The Home Minister said that the security of anyone has not been removed but has been changed and the same has been given to the Home Minister, vice-president of the country

 Voting will take place after the no-confidence motion is discussed on Friday
 lekin is prastaav kii timming ko lekar congress bantati hui najar aa rahi he
 According to information received from sources, a section of Congress in favor of the timing of the no confidence motion believes that if this is the last parliamentary session of the Modi government, then the opposition will miss the chance that the government could not complete the term without the no confidence motion
 iskaa maananaa he ki yah record main rahanaa chahie ki maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav aayaa tha
 The intention behind this argument is that the media coverage of the debate will provide an opportunity to take the issues against the Modi government to the public
 vahiin vipaksh ek saath ikattha hoga
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also have to fight hard to convince his colleagues and other parties
 jabaki avishvaas prastaav kii timming ke virodh main congress ke ek dhade kaa maananaa he ki vipaksh modi sarkaar ke trep main aa gaya
 On the condition of anonymity, a senior Congress leader has said till date that Prime Minister Modi will give his speech in Lok Sabha on Friday evening before voting on the proposal

 Read this: Modi government's first fire test, to be discussed on no-confidence motion on Friday
 This faction of Congress believes that the mistake was made by giving Prime Minister Modi a platform in the first week of the Parliament session
 kyonki avishvaas prastaav par sahmati ke chalate sadan main pehle hi din sarkaar apane kai bill paas karaane me kaamyaab ho gai
 If this proposal was to be agreed, then it was to be expressed in the last days of the session
 shaayad vipaksh ko ummid hi nahin thi ki sarkaar pehle din hi avishvaas prastaav par maan jaaegi
 It is worth noting that not only the Congress but the opposition parties also had differences on the impeachment brought by the opposition against Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra

 com / zcc21v25j2 pradhanmantri ji, You may not know Mrs
 Rekha Lagad
 main bhi nahin jaanata tha iske baavjood ki wo meri hi sosayadi main rahati hai
 Mrs
 Lagard started calling me for the last few months
 thik se baat nahin hui to ghar bhi ain
 During this time i failed to live up to my promise to him and got lost in the busyness of work
 misses lagad apana makasad nahin bhuulin
 She lives alone in our society, yet went to NDTV office
 kai baar phone bhi kiya kyonki ve mujhe takalif nahin dena chaahati thim
 According to what came out from there, she started working on her cause
 jaise aapane swatchta abhiyaan ke liye ek makasad tay kiya he vaise hi misses lagad us abhiyaan ke liye kuch karnaa chaahati hai
 Mrs
 Lagad came again to my house last evening
 unke haath main kuch check the
 She started telling my wife at the door to give it to Ravish
 main misses lagad se thodi hi duuri par tha
 Said yes please give it to me
 awaz sunakar kaha ki are aap yaheen hai
 Sorry i didn't see main thodaa chaunkaa ki aapako dikhaai nahin diya sab thik to he na
 Yes yes, all is well, just because of cataract operation, something is looking blurred right now, so could not see you
 yah kehete hue unhone lifaafaa pakadaa diya
 i was surprised when i opened the envelope as he left
 kaash aap tak yah lifaafaa sidhe pahunchataa
 You would have given them a call that i did not even think that this campaign would become such a motive of the people
 darasal aapke daftar tak hazaron, lakhon or karodon ke check lekar bahut log aae honge
 They will probably be powerful people or will be so capable that arranging a few crores for them will not be a big deal
 ho saktaa he ki wo is bahaane aapse kareeb bhi hona chaahate hon lekin ham patrakaron ko aadat hi he pehle shaq karne kii
 This habit also keeps us well
 lekin misses lagad jaisi vruddh auraten kahaan aap tak pahunch paaengi
 Their movement is also so careful that now they may not have the strength to take so much trouble
 par desh ke liye kuch karne kaa makasad ab bhi bachaa hua he
 You might be thinking that the deposits in these ten checks will be very large
 darasal baat raashi kii he hi nahin
 But by saying yes, the importance of your campaign definitely increases
 isse pehle main bhi apni baat kah duun
 It is a good campaign but it is not happening as much as it should be
 pratinidhiyon ne shuruaati sakriyata ke baad isse kinaaraa kar liya he
 They have also agreed that this is the work of some unknown and invisible system
 gandagi kaa raaj kaayam he
 People's participation has weakened and the system to continue this campaign has not been established
 ho saktaa he aap is maamle main soch rahe honge or kuch karne vaale honge
 The envelope of Mrs Lagad is enough to remind you that it is your responsibility not to disintegrate it
 ab meraa farz banataa he ki main bharat ke pradhanmantri ko un mahilaon ke naam bataa duun jinhone na jane apni kis bachat se aapke liye itnaa sabakuch bachaaya hoga
 Preeti Pruthi, Smita Priyadarshini, Sharda Dingley, Chitralekha Khemka, Aruna Singh, Soni Acharya, Bhavana Wantu, Apara Pandey, Nandita Kumar
 rakam bahut badi nahin magar kul nau hazaar rupee kaa ye check main enditivi ke swatchta abhiyaan main jamaa kar rahaa hum
 All these checks are in the name of Charities and Foundation
 maine poocha bhi ki aap kis campan ke liye dena chaahati hai
 In a slow and polite voice, he said that we all want to do something for the cleanliness campaign
 aap usee abhiyaan ke liye de dijiyegaa
 Hope you have this campaign going on actively
 vigyapanon or hording kii duniya se baahar nikal kar system or logon kii kalpanaaon main jagah bana rahaa hoga
 Take care of this campaign

 Ever since the constitution has been amended by the central government for the provision of 10 percent reservation for poor people of the upper castes, Bihar politics or you can say caste politics once again boiled over
 rajya ke do pramukh dal sattarudh janata dal unaited (jediu) or rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke netaa bhale kaarykram kuch bhi ho lekin aarakshan ke mudde par apane prayaas, us disha main uthaaye gayi qadam or vartmaan sandarbh main apane vichaar rakhana nahin bhoolatey
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have taken this step in view of the fact that the upper caste people do not have to be partisan in the Lok Sabha elections, but the truth on the ground is that after this step, there is a feeling of dissatisfaction among the backward castes and Dalit community and in Bihar Both RJD and JDU are trying to cash in on their own ways
 jahaan rashtriya janata dal, jo is mudde par pehle din se sansad se sadak tak aakraamak he, uskaa prayaas he ki is mudde par gair yadav pichhadi or ati pichhadi jatiyon ko apane paramparaagat vot bank se ek baar phir joda jaae
 At the same time, JDU is speaking a little bit loudly
 uskaa har sambhav prayaas he ki rajd ke pichley itihaas ko ujagar kar kam se kam nuqasaan saha jaae or apane votaron ko samet kar rakhaa jaye
 This is the reason why Nitish Kumar, who was perhaps not taken into confidence by the BJP central leadership, showed no haste in reacting
 nitish kumaar kii party ne samvidhan sanshodhan kaa samarthan kiya lekin is qadam ke upar nitish kii pratikriya tatkaal nahin mili
 He was welcomed when he opened his mouth as there was no tampering with the reservation of backward castes and scheduled castes and tribes of the present 50 percent and a separate 10% reservation was made
 lekin saath hi saath unhone pichhadi jatiyon kii aabaadi ke anuroop aarakshan badhaane ke maang kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 Nitish also clearly gave a practical solution that if the next census which is going to be held in 2021, along with caste census, then the provision of current reservation can be increased based on its data
 nitish ko bhi is baat kaa andaaza he ki pichhadi jatiyon or daliton main koi harsh kaa maahaul nahin he lekin unki koshish he ki rajd is agenda ko hijank pana kar le
 Therefore, Nitish discusses his role in every meeting, which was introduced in the era of former Chief Minister Late Karpoori Thakur, in which the backward and the most backward were classified among the Backward and the most backward
 saath-saath mandal kamishan ke puure desh main lagu hone ke baad kaise unhone us samay ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu yadav dwaara karpuri thakur dwaara jari aarakshan ko khatm kar mandal kamishan ko lagu karne kii koshishon kaa mukhar virodh kiya tha, isaki bhi vistrut charchaa karte hai
 a big advantage with Nitish is that he took 20 per cent reservation to the backward castes in panchayats and also conducted a detailed survey as soon as he took power in Bihar
 haalanki nitish ne sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kaa hawala dete hue karpuri thakur formula main savarna jatiyon ke garibon ko jo 3% aarakshan kaa praavdhaan tha or jise lalu yadav ne khatm kar diya tha, use phir kabhi waapas lagu nahin kiya, lekin aarakshan ke maamle main nitish apane virodhiyon par baari padate hai
 At the same time, the Rashtriya Janata Dal started protesting with the decision of the Union Cabinet
 rajd kaa kahana tha ki 'ham savarna jatiyon ke garibon ke aarakshan ke virdohi to nahin hai lekin saath hi saath agar aap 15% aabaadi ko 10 pratishat aarakshan de rahe hai to OBC jatiyon kaa pratishat 56 pratishat he, to unka unke liye bhi aarakshan aabaadi ke anupaat main hona chahie
 RJD leaders not only strongly opposed this in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, but the Leader of Opposition in Bihar Tejashwi Yadav every day asks the government questions on social media if not from the public platform
 rajd ko maaloom he ki unke is qadam ke baad unki agadi jati ke kuch puraane netaaon ko agar chhod den to loksabhaa chunaav ho yaa vidhansabha chunaav, unhen agadi jatiyon kaa vot milane se rahaa
 But they estimate or say that the state will once again have voters of backward castes like the 90s and there will be a huge boat bank along with muslim-dalit
 lekin abhi tak to rajd netaaon ke paksh main aisa samarthan yaa golbandi zamin par ho rahi ho, uskaa bahut udhaaharan dekhne ko nahin mila he
 But he claims that according to the feedback there is a lot of dissatisfaction in the rural areas on this issue
 lekin yah vot main tabdeel ho paaegaa is par sanshay he kyonki nitish kumaar kii bhi ati pichhadi jatiyon main or gaiyr yadav pichhadi jatiyon main majboot pakad he
 At the same time, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is more excited on this issue, is breathing a sigh of relief that at least now they will not have to face the discontent of upper castes like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
 chunaav main unhen maan manouvval karne kii zarurat nahin hogi or aarakshan ke mudde par nitish kumaar kaa jo trek record rahaa he, uski duhai dekar wo loksabhaa chunaav kii naiya aasaani se paar kar sakate hai
 BJP leaders say that NDA has a huge advantage in all the channels surveyed recently
 isse saaf he ki rajd pichhadon or daliton main is mudde par jis asantosh kii baat kar rahi he wo hawa main tir chalaane ke samaan he
 Yes, he definitely believes that if Nitish was not leading the coalition in Bihar and was in the Grand Alliance, BJP would have got 1-2 seats after this step on the issue of reservation
 lekin NDA ke netaa is baat ko lekar sashankit hai ki agar is mudde par sarvocch nyaayalay ne agle do teen maheene ke dauraan yaa chunaav ke bich-bich is samvidhan sanshodhan ke pratikul agar koi tippanee yaa faisalaa de diya to yah jo aarakshan kaa pasa he wo ulta bhi pad saktaa he
 Therefore, senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Modi is now saying that the caste reservation that Nitish Kumar has raised will definitely be in the next census
 saath hi saath vishvavidhyalay or collejon main shikshakon kii niyukti se sambandhit jo aarakshan ke roster kaa sawaal he us par bhi NDA ke netaa ashanvit hai ki centre sarkaar loksabhaa ke agle satr main aavashyak bill zarur laaegi
 However, be it the leader of any party, they have a similar view on one thing: Now the appointments in government jobs are decreasing so much that the well of reservation is drying up day by day
 lekin yah baat bhi he ki savarna jatiyon ke liye jo aarakshan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he uske baad anusuchit jati ho yaa janajati yaa pichhadi jatiyaan, sabko vartmaan main jo aarakshan kaa laabh he wo ab kam lag rahaa he or unke bich se or adhik kii maang khaaskar pichhadi jatiyon se or adhik aarakshan kii maang aane vaale dinon main badhegi jiskaa kisi ko laabh milegaa to kisi ko nuqasaan nishchit rup se uthaanaa padegaa
