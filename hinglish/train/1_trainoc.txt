 sapa main haashie par chal rahe netaa shivpal yadav ne elaan kiya he ki vah 11 march ke baad nai party kaa gathan karenge
 He expressed his anger that the tickets of my supporters have been cut
 ab ye log kahaan jaaenge
 Meanwhile, there are also speculations that this time he will contest from his traditional seat Jaswantnagar as an independent candidate
 haalanki unhone abhi tak yahi kaha he ki ye sab afvaahen hai or vah sapa ke chunaav nishaan cycle se hi chunaav ladenge
 In fact, Shivpal Yadav has become marginalized in the party after SP command Akhilesh Yadav came fully into the hands
 darasal jab vah party ke pradesh adhyaksh the to unhone mulaayam singh ke saath milakar disambar main pratyaashiyon kii suchi jari kii thi
 After that, when Akhilesh finally got the command after the fierce fighting in the party , he rejected that list and released his new list
 uske baad shivpal or mulaayam samarthakon ke tikat katkar akhilesh ne apane samarthakon ko tikat die
 After reconciliation between father and son, Mulayam gave a list of 38 of his supporters to Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne usamen se bhi kuch logon ko tikat nahin diya
 When Mulayam gave these 38 names for the first time, Shivpal did not have a name in it and his son Aditya was replaced
 baad main shivpal kaa naam usamen joda gaya
 Shivpal Yadav is contesting from Jaswantnagar seat of Etawah
 haalanki ab sapa-congress gathbandhan hone ke baad bhi siyaasi tasviir badal gai he
 Mulayam has openly opposed this alliance, saying that he will not campaign in support of it
 mulaayam kheme kaa maananaa he ki isse unke samarthakon kaa nuksaan hoga or party kaaryakarta congress ko di gai siton par chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 He has also told his supporters and the rebels of Akhilesh that he will contest the Congress seats as an independent candidate and he will support him
 shivpal kii naaraazgi ko mulaayam kii is ghoshnaa se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The reason for this is that Shivpal has also said that if his supporters call him for campaigning, he will go to promote them
 yani saaf he ki mulaayam-shivpal ke kai samarthakon jinhone akhilesh se naaraazgi ke chalate party chodi he, unka prachaar karne shivpal jaaenge
 It is worth mentioning that some time ago there was a lot of fierce fighting in the SP among the Yadav family
 us dauraan party main do faad ho gaya tha
 On one side were Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav and on the other side there were Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal
 uski parinti sapa main takhtapalat ke rup main hui
 Akhilesh Yadav was made the national president of the party
 shivpal yadav ko party ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataa diya gaya
 The matter of occupation on the election trail reached the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ke akhilesh ke paksh main faisla dene ke baad ek taraf se unako vaidhanik manyata mil gai
 The comments darasal sapa kii kaman akhilesh yadav ke haathon main puri tarah se aane ke baad shivpal yadav party main ekadam haashie par pahunch gaye hai
 In fact, when he was the state president of the party, he along with Mulayam Singh released the list of candidates in December
 uske baad party main jabardast ghamaasan ke baad antim rup se jab kaman akhilesh ko mili to unhone us suchi ko khaarij kar diya or apni nai suchi jari kii
 After this, Akhilesh gave tickets to his supporters by cutting the tickets of Shivpal and Mulayam supporters
 pita-putr main sulah hone ke baad mulaayam ne apane 38 samarthakon kii suchi akhilesh kaa di thi
 Akhilesh did not give tickets to some of them
 mulaayam ne jab pehali baar ye 38 naam die the tab usamen shivpal kaa naam nahin tha or unki jagah bete aditya kaa naam tha
 Shivpal's name was later added to it
 shivpal yadav itawa kii jaswantnagar seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 However, even after the formation of sp-congress alliance, the political picture has changed
 mulaayam ne is gathbandhan kaa khuletaur par virodh karte hue kaha he ki vah iske samarthan main chunaav prachaar nahin karenge
 The Mulayam camp believes that this will harm their supporters and party workers will not be able to contest the seats given to the Congress
 unhone apane samarthakon or akhilesh ke baagiyon se bhi kaha he ki vah congress kii siton par nirdaleey pratyaashee ke rup main utren or vah unka samarthan karenge
 Shivpal's displeasure is also linked to this announcement of Mulayam
 isaki vajah yah he ki shivpal ne yah kaha bhi he ki unke samarthak yadi unako prachaar ke liye bulaayenge to vah unka prachaar karne jaaenge
 It is clear that many supporters of mulayam-shivpal who have left the party due to their displeasure with Akhilesh will go to Shivpal to promote them
 ullekhneey he ki kuch samay pehle sapa main yadav parivaar ke bich main jabardast ghamaasan machaa tha
 During that time the party was torn in two
 ek taraf mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav the to duusari taraf akhilesh yadav or ramgopal the
 It culminated in a coup in SP
 akhilesh yadav ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Shivpal Yadav was removed from the post of state president of the party
 chunaav nishaan par kabje kii ladaai kaa maamla chunaav ayog ke paas pahunchaa
 After the Election Commission gave its verdict in favor of Akhilesh, he got legal recognition from one side

 Water crisis is becoming increasingly deep in the whole country
 abhi chennai samet desh ke kai ilaakon main log jal sankat se pareshaan hai
 Gradually, its scope will increase further and this crisis will start to appear everywhere
 jal sankat ko taalane ke liye lagaataar jal sangrakshan kii baat kii ja rahi he, lekin is sambandh main jis tarah se chijen ho rahi hai usase yahi lagata he ki abhi bhi yah jaruri abhiyaan mahaj rasm adaayagi hi he
 However, the Delhi Jal Board has imposed a fine of Rs 48 crore on its own consumers for not conserving the rain water
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki mahaj 8 fisadi barish ke pani kaa sahi tareeke se istemaal or harvesting kiya jaataa he
 In this way, more than 90 percent of the rain water gets washed away and it is not used properly, but in the way there is a water crisis in the country, rain water conservation becomes very important
 desh main ek baar phir barish kaa sijan he or lagaataar barish ke kaaran kai shahar pani se labalab hai lekin unhen sangrahit nahin kiya ja rahaa
 The special thing is that people in urban areas waste more water than villagers and urban people are laggards in terms of conservation
 jal sangrakshan se jude visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki is par teji se kaam kiya janaa chahie or varsha jal sangrakshan ko badhaakar 15 fisadi laayaa janaa chahie
 The NITI Aayog report says that by 2030, 40 percent of India's population will not have access to drinking water and will have to struggle a lot
 21 shaharon par sankatrajadhani dilli samet bengaluru, chennai or hyderabad samet 21 bade shaharon main 2020 tak jalastr behad neeche chalaa jayega
 For this reason 100 million people will be facing water crisis
 narendra modi ke duusari baar satta main aane ke baad sarkaar jal sangrakshan kii baat jor shor se kar rahi he 
 Prime Minister Modi fulfilled the promise made during the Lok Sabha elections to form the 'ministry of Water Power' by combining the Ministries of Water Resources and Drinking Water and Sanitation
 sarkaar ne yah ahm kaam gajendra singh shekhavat ko saunpte hue unhen kendriya mantri banaaya jabaki ratan laal kataaria ko rajya mantri banaaya
 Modi government 2
 0 ke pehle bajet ke elaan se pehle kendriya jalashakti mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ne 'jal shakti abhiyaan' shuru kiya
 Under this campaign, 5 points will be stressed on 1,592 blocks of 256 districts facing water scarcity
 inamen jal sangrakshan or varsha jal sanchayan, peyajal kii safai, parpanraagat or duusare jal nikaayon ke navinikaran, jal ke dobaaraa istemaal or dhaanchon ke punarbharan tathaa jalavibhaajan vikaas or gahan vanikaran shaamil he
 Rajasthan (29), Tamil Nadu (27) and Telangana (24) districts have been included in the maximum out of 256 districts
 in jilon par kaam ke liye apper sachivon or sanyukt sachivon tak ke adhikariyon ko lagaaya gaya he
 69 per cent increase in NRDWP fund and on the other hand farmers in rural areas will also be made aware for irrigation and choosing the right crop, while on the other hand, waste water in urban areas will be made ready for the purpose of industrial and agricultural sector
 256 jilon ke liye chalaae ja rahe abhiyaan ke tahat nae bajet main kisi alag tarah se bajet kaa aavanton nahin kiya gaya he, inke liye gramin kshetron main jari kai yojanaon ke jariye fund jutanaa hoga
 In the first budget of the second term of the Modi government, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave 9,150 for the National Rural Drinking Water Management (NRDWP)
 36 karod rupee aavantit kiye hai jo 2018-19 ke bajet (5,391
 32 rupees)
 ho saktaa he ki is raashi ko tamilnadu, karnataka, gujarat or maharashtra jaise rajyon ke kai bade shaharon main pani kii killat ko dekhte hue badhaayaa gaya he
 According to the Finance Minister, by 2024, under the 'har Ghar Nal, Har Nal Jal' scheme, the Modi government aims to deliver water to every household across the country
 svachh peyajal ke liye 20 hajaar karod rupee se zyada die gaye hai
 Of this, Rs 8245 crore will be spent on the development of rivers and through this 450 rivers will be interlinked
 pichhali sarkaar main 60 nadiyon ko jodne kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya tha
 Although no concrete work has been done in the last 70 years towards water conservation, but now it needs to be worked on fast
 dilli main 11,635 logon par jurmanarashtriya rajdhani dilli ke kai kshetra lambey samay se jal sankat se jujh rahe hai or yahaan par jal sanchayan abhiyaan bhi chalaaya ja rahaa he, lekin ummid ke mutabik parinaam nikal kar nahin aayaa
 The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) imposed a fine of 48 crores on 11,635 consumers who have land area of more than 500 square meters, but they did not prepare rain water harvesting structure
 dilli ke lihaaj se dekhen to bhoojal str girane se pani kii gunvattta bhi prabhavit hui he
 Delhi has 13,491 million cusec meters (mcm) of water with 10,238 mcm of saline
 mahaj 3,207 emsm pani hi saaf suthra bachaa he
 Due to increasing demand for water, the ground water exploitation in Delhi is constantly increasing, but the recharge is decreasing therein
 barish ke kaaran 175 million kusek meter (emsm) pani ko sangrahit kar bhoojal ke str badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Unnecessary water expenditure: India is an agricultural country and more than 50 percent people depend on agriculture
 desh kii sava sau karod kii aabaadi ke liye anaaj kaa utpaadan karne vaale kisaan kaaphi had tak barish par nirbhar rahete hai or pichley kuch saalon main monsoon main utaar-chadhaav hota rahaa he
 The water crisis has been increasing in rural areas as well as urban areas
 gramin log shahari logon kaa tulana main pani bevajaah kharch nahin karte, jabaki shaharon main rahane vaale log barish jal sanchayan par baat to khub karte hai lekin iske prati gambhir nahin hote
 People in urban areas use an average of 250 liters of water daily through things like bathing (with shower), brushing, cooking, washing utensils, toilet, washing machine etc
 kheti ke liye pani kii jarurat to he hi, saath main anya kaaryon ke liye bhi barsha jal sanchayan kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The government has been discussing water harvesting for some time, so the people of urban areas should work seriously on this and use their contribution to overcome water scarcity, using the government grant

 The Congress says that the governor can ask to prove majority in the house only when a no-confidence motion is brought

 China finally showed its color
 lagaataar chauthi baar china jaish sargana masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit karaane main roda ban gaya
 'masood Prem' of 'dragon' is not the only way
 darasal, iske peeche china ke aise kai hit hai jo masood ajahar kaa bachaav karne se saadhe ja rahe hai
 China does not want to take risks in diplomatic relations
 Experts in diplomatic affairs believe that no nation stands in cooperation with another unless its national interests are involved
 china jaisaa desh to bina badi vajah ke aisa kabhi nahin kar saktaa, kyonki wo apni rashtriya suraksha or kootnithik sambandhon ke maamle main koi jokhim nahin letaa
 
 
 
 to pakistan aatankwaad pryojit raashtra ghoshit ho jayegaaise main visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit na hone dene ke peeche china ke kai bade hit chupe hue hai
 China also knows that after Hafiz Saeed, if India is successful in getting Masood Azhar included in the list of banned terrorists of the United Nations, then it will come very close to declaring Pakistan a terrorism-sponsored nation
 aisi sthiti main america samet pashchimi desh pakistan par tamaam tarah ke pratibandh laga denge, jisase pakistan ke liye raajnneetik or aarthik mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai
 At the same time, they will also have a special effect on China
 chaar saal main china 50 arab dollar laga chukaa he pakistan menmasood ajahar ko bachaane ke alaava bhi china har tarah se is is koshish main laga he ki pakistan alag-thalag na pade
 Not only this, China is also trying to bring Russia closer to Pakistan
 pichley chaar saalon main china ne pakistan main bada nivesh kiya he
 It also includes the china-pakistan Economic Corridor i
e
 CPEC being built with $ 50 billion
 bataate hai ki china ko dar he ki agar usne masood kaa samarthan nahin kiya yaa antarrashtriya manchon par pakistan kii pairvi nahin kii to uskaa itnaa bada nivesh kahin dub na jaae
 Masood's opposition means not getting the support of Pakistan
 China feels that groups like jaish-e-muhammad may be against him and the Government of Pakistan for not doing so
 jaish-e-mohammad ko lekar itihaas bhi kuch aisa hi kahata he
 When the Pakistani government banned Jaish in 2002, there were several attacks on the then President Musharraf and it became difficult to handle the situation in the country
 aise haalat main agar china masood ajahar ke khilaaf hone vaali antarrashtriya karrwai kaa saath detaa he to pakistan ke liye china kaa sahyog lenaa yaa use sahyog dena kaaphi mushkil ho jayega
 If Masood was banned, Pakistan would have been isolated
 If Masood Azhar was declared a global terrorist after China's yes, then Pakistan would have to take strong action against Masood and the organizations associated with him
 masood azhar or uske sanghathan ko puri tarah alag-thalag karnaa padataa
 The closure of Masood Azhar's Terror Camp and its madrasas would have become a compulsion for Pakistan
 koun he masood ajaharpakistan punjab ke bahawalpur main ek headmaster ke ghar masood ajahar kaa janm 10 july 1968 ko hua tha
 Masood was third among his eleven siblings
 padhane-likhane main jahin tha

 vahaan wo oonchi talim hasil karne kii jagah aatank kii kitaab padhane laga
 Arrested in 1994, Sasud has become a master of increasing terror and hatred with his poisonous strife
 masood koi saadhaaran aatankwaadi nahin he
 Masood Azhar, with the help of the Pakistani government, the Pakistani Army and its intelligence agency ISI, started conspiracy to spread terror in India

 He said that Shivraj Singh Chauhan did not say anything wrong
 logon ne essi-asti act ko padhaa hi nahin he
 That's why these kinds of things are happening
 unhone kaha ki essi-asti act main ek jagah likhaa hua he ki iff condishan arise yani yadi jarurat pade, tab bina jaanch ke giraftaar ho
 There is nowhere in this act to arrest without investigation
 madhya pradesh main congress bijepi ke khilaaf maahaul bana rahi thi
 Intentionally tricking Dalits
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne sahi kaha he ki bina jaanch kiye essi-asti act main koi giraftaar nahin hogi
 Social harmony will also be maintained due to police investigation
 meghavaal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa puraa focus daliton or garibon ke hit par he
 He says in every speech and in every meeting that we have to decide that we have good plans
 uskaa labhdlitonko mili
 The entire focus of the BJP is on the welfare of Dalits
 gauratlab he kirajasthanmen essi-asti ko milakar 30 fisadi se zyada vot hai
 Which alone are in a decisive role in 70 to 80 seats, but the problem before the BJP is that it has its upper caste vote
 bijepi ko lagata he ki essi-asti act ke andolan main kahin uskaa savarna vot na bikhar jaae
 Therefore, she is lashing out at the Dalits along with the upper castes
 gauratlab he ki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main zyaadaatar daliton ne congress ko chhod bijepi ko vot diya tha

 Meghwal called it non-parliamentary and said that Rahul Gandhi has insulted the post of Prime Minister
 chaukeedaar ko chor kehane kaa matlab pradhanmantri ko chor kaha gaya he

 Therefore, the RSS believes that by making Tibet's independence a global issue, the Indian government should try to end the human rights violations in China by Tibet

 isi niti ke chalate haal hi main china ne sikkim se sate bhutan ke ilaake doklam main apni asuri takaton kaa istemaal karne kii koshish kii thi
 However, this move could not succeed due to the joint efforts of Bhutan and India

 In an open conversation with Associate Editor Suhani Singh at the 'big Bang Bar and Cafe', just a few feet away from their studio in Bandra, Mumbai, both of them quipped a lot on their director friend Sujoy Ghosh and did not spare each other
 pyaar main kabhi-kabhi kaa sangeet compoj karne ke liye aap donon ko alag-alag contract diya gaya
 Did you know that both are working for the same film? Didn't it cause sourness? Vishal: You are saying as she probably should have
 lekin aisa nahin tha kyonki ham usase paanch saal pehle se achche dost the
 We were both very happy to see each other there
 hamane ek-duusare ko apni dhune sunaayi
 This led to a different experience than competing because Shekhar was more obsessed with me as a musician
 shekharsbase khubasurat anubhav yah tha ki hamen film mujic dene kaa ilm nahin tha
 We were novices
 main jab studio main vishaal se mila or paaya ki ham donon ek hi project par kaam kar rahe hai to laga ki ham saath-saath karen to gajab kaa talmail banegaa
 That's how the title became the tune
 vishalduske baad se ham sab kuch saath-saath karne lage, vigyaapan se lekar film tak jo bhi hamen mila
 Is different background of music the biggest strength of both of you? Vishal: Shekhar also writes rock songs
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki alag-alag tarah ke mujic kaa becoground koi vajah he ki nahin, lekin ham ek-duusare ke saath kaaphi sahaj hai
 Shekhar: Many people say that we are from different backgrounds
 pehle to hamen yah bhi ehsaas nahin tha ki ham main geet likhane kii kaabiliyat he
 i learned to play the piano and because of my hobby of classical music
 mere dead acordian bajaayaa karte the
 i did not even realize that i would come in the field of music, nor was Vishal
 to koi aisi takat he jo ham donon ko jode hue he
 Vishal: You have said a romantic thing
 shekharahaan, yaar
 It was written in our luck that we come together
 yahi takat ham donon ke peeche he
 Although the mood of the two of you seems different
 vishaldyah ekadam galat he
 It is spread of Shekhar
 asal main yah acha aadmi nahin he
 It is of the current type
 shekharanjab tum yah kah rahe ho us samay main ithla rahaa hum or apni muunchon ko taav de rahaa hum
 Vishal: Actually our moods are met
 donon hi is maamle main besharm hai ki ham apane kaam par kaaphi garv mahasoos karte hai
 This confidence arises that whatever we do, we do it with great fun
 ham kaam ke peeche kabhi nahin bhaagate
 For example, four years after our first film, we got the second film Jhankar Beats (2003)
 us dauraan ham vigyaapan filmein kar rahe the or usee main mashgool the
 Shekhar: We still did not have a bank of songs and neither is today
 koi diarector hamaare paas aae or kahe ki ‘koi dhun sunaao’ to hamaare paas kuch nahin he
 Give us a script, only then we will be able to make a song
 aap gane compoj karne kaa kya tarika apanaate hai?vishaldkash! koi tarika hota to vaaki aasaan ho jaataa
 This is how we work
 sujoy (ghosh, diarector) hamaare saath 1999 se judaa he, vah apni film jhankaar beats banane main laga tha
 He knew the script and we too
 jab film ai tab tak ham achche dost ban gaye the
 You should know that no one can teach you music composing for a film
 yah aap karte hue hi sikh sakate hai
 Shekhar: Gaane is part of the script
 aapako yah andaja lagaana hota he ki film main kya chal rahaa he, diarector ke dimag main kya he or aap compoj karne se pehle jaise film dekh lete hai
 You see the characters and their feelings in your mind
 
 
 har film ko or unke kirdaaron ko apana alag tarah kaa spes chahie hota he
 Does the script always determine the place where the song is to be cast? Vishal: Not everyone
 masalan, kahani film main ham jo chaahe kar sakate the
 However, we later realized that the film lacked songs, which is a trademark of Sujoy Ghosh
 shekharahamen dhun banane ke liye baari dabaav main kaam karnaa padaa
 (imitating Sujoy) He would often say, 'give me songs, you are not giving me songs
 ’ jab hamane film dekhi to maine vishaal se poocha, ‘gane kidar hai?’vishalhyahi to baat he
 We are happy to work with a director who uses his understanding
 main samajhataa hum ki kahani kii dhun hamaari sabase acchhee dhunon main he or hameshaa rahegi
 Yes, if there were only songs, more people would have heard
 lekin sujoy ne film kii edieting ke samay paaya ki gane kahani se dhyaan banta rahe hai
 Often in many Hindi films, i feel like singing my hair
 mujhe khushi he ki is film main zyada gane nahin hai
 What kind of music have you been listening to in your teen age? Vishal: i am lucky that my parents have been music lovers
 mere dead ke paas bada collection tha
 The record also had no partition, it was discovered that R
S
 di
 Next to Burman is the record of Led Zeppelin
 kisi ne mujhe nahin bataaya ki ye alag-alag dhang ke mujic ke hai
 It was very much like Mumbai syndrome because when you are here, you get music from all over the world and anyway, it is the land of Hindi film music
 shekharamain apni kishoravastha main dead ko acordian par raaj kapur kii filmon kaa mujic bajaate sunata tha, hamane lata ji, aashaa ji, shankar-jaykishan, madan mohan vagairah ko suna
 Dad's friends used to have parties in our house and they all used to sing old songs
 jagajeet ji (jagajeet singh) mere dead ke achche dost the
 He used to come home and sing
 mujhe unase seekhney kaa saubhaahgya hasil hua
 There is a ruckus about work among themselves? Vishal: We are in search of better song or tune
 aapako pataa he ki ham donon hi samaan rup se kaam karte hai
 There is no single case here
 donon ke hi naam saath-saath rahane hai
 That's why we always try to do better than anything
 shekharbaham ek-duusare kii khub khinchaai karte hai
 This kind of pull makes the song even better
 vishaldgar main kuch suna rahaa hum or shekhar kuch nahin bolta he to samaj jaataa hum ki dhun kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Shekhar: If we both get filled with enthusiasm on a line, then we understand that the matter is going well
 99
 In 99 per cent of cases, such a tune is also liked by the director
 shekhar, ladkiyaan bhi aapaki kaaphi fain hai or camere ke saamne aap sahaj bhi dikhte hai
 Did you ever get acting opportunities and you thought about them? Shekhar: No
 hamane jivan main kabhi kuch plan kiya hi nahin
 We flow along the stream
 chaahe film ho yaa tour karnaa ho, bas chal padate hai
 i don't think much about it
 main bhavishya kii chintaa main padane kii bajaae bas maujuuda lamhe kaa hi majaa letaa hum
 The good thing with TV is that people start watching music by adding the face of a music director or singer
 mujhe vishaal yaa vishaal shekhar bhi kaha gaya he
 Bappi Lahiri has also been called
 vishalthmujhe shankar mahadevan bataa diya gaya or ek baar to maine unki tarah autograph bhi diya
 Shekhar: But, Bappi Lahiri! i was surprised, "have i become so tired?" "we always have a lot of fun" a song that you as a songwriter take pride in
 vishalthmujhe darasal kai gaanon par garv he
 In particular, you are love, all the people of Allah, dance hard
 shekhartous geet ke bol bemisaal hai
 Tohra Dil Ka Theater Maa, Dil Deewana Booking Advance Mare Re
 kya baat he
 Vishal: For me, it is like levity
 mujic ke bare main yah chupaane kii koi darkaar nahin ki yah logon ko anand dene ke liye he
 i based it on Bachchan's old songs
 yah mere liye badi uplabdhi he
 About synergy on stage
 shekharlakisi sho main ham manch ke peeche hi milte hai
 And suddenly when they come on stage, it seems that they have come for a week preparing for this show

 Most of the time i know what he is thinking, and he is knowing what i am thinking
 vishaldmanch par to ham mood main hote hai
 Many times we shout loudly because we know that we are going to introduce something completely new
 hamen saath rakhane vaali buniyadi baat yah he ki ham aisa kuch nahin karte jisamen majaa na aata ho
 We try to make fun of whatever work we undertake

 In such a situation, we cannot go with the Congress, but in big states like Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, not a single Rajput has been given a BJP ticket

 On the question of Karni Sena leaders being sold with money, Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi said that when we support BJP for some good work, then Congress accuses us of selling and if we support Congress, BJP charges She applies
 isliye bhi ham apni raajnneetik party banaaenge
 In Rajasthan, the solidarity of Jats has increased under the leadership of Hanuman Beniwal
 usee tarah se meena netaa ke rup main kirodi laal meena or gurjar netaa ke rup main karnal kirodi singh bansla ne apni pahchaan banaai he

 The Karnataka government has approached the Supreme Court against the acquittal of the disproportionate assets case to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa
 apni apil main sarkaar ne kaha, hycourt kaa aadesh sirf tamaasha or gaiyrkanoonee he
 The acquittal of Jaya has led to the defeat of the law, so the order of the Karnataka High Court should be stayed and his membership should be canceled
 yachika main rajya sarkaar ne kaha he ki hycourt ne apane faisle main aay se adhik sampatti kaa galat aankalan kiya he
 The amount of Jayalalithaa's disproportionate assets is 76 per cent and not 8
 12 fisadi
 This mistake has made the order invalid
 yachika main aage kaha gaya ki hycourt main karnataka sarkaar ko apni daleel rakhane kaa mauka nahin diya gaya, kyonki maamle main rajya ko party hi nahin banaaya gaya
 Because of this, the entire legal process in the High Court got disturbed
 jabaki abhiyojan paksh ne saare sabooton ke bal par ye sabit kar diya tha ki jaya ke paas 66 karod kii sampatti he, lekin hycourt ne in sabooton par thik se gaur nahin kiya
 The comments aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main special court ne jaya or teen anya ko chaar saal kii sajaa or 100 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 Because of this, he had to lose the chief minister's chair, but in May this year, he was acquitted by the Karnataka High Court and said that if the income is ten per cent higher then it cannot be considered a crime
 iske baad jayalalita dobaaraa mukhyamantri ban gai thim
 She is now contesting from RK Nagar on June 27
 es main kaha ja saktaa he ki unki mushkilen abhi khatm nahin hui hai
 In the petition, the state government has said that the High Court in its judgment has wrongly assessed the disproportionate assets
 jayalalita dwaara aay se adhik sampatti arjeet kiye jane kii raashi 76 fisadi he na kii 8
 12 percent
 is galati ne aadesh ko amaanya bana diya he
 The petition further said that the Karnataka government was not given an opportunity to present its arguments in the High Court as the state was not made a party in the case
 isi vajah se hycourt main puri kanoonee prakriya bighad gai
 While the prosecution had proved on the basis of all the evidence that Jaya had assets worth Rs 66 crore, the High Court did not properly examine these evidence
 tippaniyan In the disproportionate assets case, the special court had sentenced Jaya and three others to four years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs 100 crore
 isaki vajah se unhen mukhyamantri kii kursi ganvaani padi thi, lekin isi saal may me karnataka hycourt ne unhen bari kar diya tha or kaha tha ki agar aay das fisadi zyada ho to use aparaadh nahin mana ja saktaa
 After this Jayalalithaa again became the Chief Minister
 wo ab aarake nagar se 27 june ko hone vaale chunaav main hissaa le rahi hai
 In the Ace it can be said that their difficulties are not over yet

 Mid-term elections were held in UP in 1991 and Mulayam Singh's party lost and BJP came to power

 He said that today reporters have been eliminated from news channels and no one can invent news
 Not going to remove

 He said let me tell you that on September 9, Ravish will be awarded this honor
 samaaj ke vanchit tabake kii awaz uthaane ke liye raveesh kumaar ko ramon magsese sammaan se sammanit kiya ja rahaa he
 Usually the award given for social work underlines the social journalism of Ravish
 is puraskaar se navaaze jane vaale raveesh pehle hindi patrkaar hai
 He started his journey from the very bottom and has reached here
 1996 se raveesh kumaar NDTV se jude rahe hai
 In the initial days NDTV used to sort the letters
 isse pehle raveesh kumaar ne apane sambodhan main kaha, 'do maheene pehle jab main 'prime Time' kii taiyaari main duba tha, tabhi cellphone par phone aayaa
 Philippines was flashing on caller ID
 mujhe laga ki kisi trol ne phone kiya he
 The number here makes me troll a lot
 agar vaaki ve saare trol yaheen rahete hai, to unka bhi swaagat he, main aa gaya hum'
 Well, before picking up the Philippines number, i told my colleagues to speak the language of the troll
 maine phone ko spikar phone par on kiya, lekin acchhee-si angrezi main ek mahila kii awaz thi, "may i please speak to Mr Ravish Kumar
 
 
 ? "thousands of trolls didn't have a single woman's voice"
 raveesh kumaar ne aage kaha, 'maine phone ko spikar phone se hataa liya
 The voice coming from that side was asking me that i am being given this year's Ramon Magsaysay Award
 main nahin aayaa hum, meri saath puri hindi patrakarita ai he, jisaki haalat in dinon bahut sharmnaak he
 The courageous journalism of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi and Pir Moonis Mohammed is scary today

 The inauguration of the Games was sparked by speculation about who would start the Games, as the Queen of Britain did not attend the opening ceremony
 prince charles ne maharani kaa sandesh padhate hue ant main kaha, ‘mujhe in khelon ke shuruyaat kii ghoshnaa karte hue apaar khushi ho rahi he
 "at the same time, Pratibha ended her speech after saying," 2010 Commonwealth Games begin now
 aaiye khelon ko shuru karen
 Pratibha said in her speech, 'india is a diverse and beautiful country and i am sure that the guests coming to participate in the Games will always remember its experience
 ’pratibha se pehle prince charles ne maharani elizabeth dwitiya kaa rashtramandal khelon ke liye diya gaya sandesh padhaa
 The final line of the message announced the commencement of the Games
 rashtramandal pramukh maharani ne apane sandesh main kaha ki yah kaaphi sukhad he ki in khelon kaa aayojan bharat main kiya ja rahaa he or landan ghoshnaa patr ko bhi 60 saal puure ho chale hai
 In this type of sporting event, when everyone is in front of each other as a rival, then there is a feeling of working together
 unhone kaha, ‘yah khel bharat or bharat ke baahar based kai logon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 i congratulate all of them and the audience for the experience that i have heard that they will cherish for a lifetime

 antarrashtriya str se dabaav jhelane ke baad pakistan apane yahaan pal rahe aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke naam par dikhaava kar rahaa he
 His pole has been exposed to register fake firs on terrorists
 pakistan yaa to aatanki or yaa phir aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf juthi exiaar darj kar rahaa he yaa phir taharir itani kamjor he ki maamle adaalaton main sunwaayee ke dauraan tik nahin sakate
 The FIR registered in a police station in Pakistan has exposed the false action against the terrorists
 darasal, aatankiyon ko aarthik sahaayta par roak lagane vaali antarrashtriya santhaan financial ection task force (efeetief) kii oktober main baithak honi he jisamen faisla liya janaa he ki aatankiyon ke sharandata pakistan ko blike list main rakhaa jaae yaa nahin
 The country has to face stringent economic sanctions when it is blacklisted
 is baithak se pehle hi pakistan apane bachaav main jute gaya he
 In Pakistan, a game is being organized in the name of registering an FIR against terrorists
 photo-aninyuja agency eenai kii report ke mutabik pakistan ke gujaravaalan main ek july ko lashkar e taiyaba or jamaat ud daawa se jude aatankiyon par exiaar darj hui
 In this, the terrorist was said to be associated with an organization called daawat-vall Irshad
 maamla ek jameen ke saude kaa tha
 Legal experts say that this case will not survive in the court as the claim of Irshad, which was mentioned in the FIR as a banned organization, has now been renamed to Jamaat-ud Dawa, a terrorist organization linked to lashkar-e-taiba
 yahi nahin is exiaar main aatanki sargana hafiz mohammad said sahit chaar anya aatankiyon ke naam nahin hai
 While these lands are used by these terrorists
 jameenon ke saude se hi aatankiyon kii funding bhi hoti he
 Legal experts say that the names of all the accused are neither registered in the FIR nor their crimes are mentioned in the FIR
 bataa den ki bangkok main financial task force kii meeting oktober ke pehle saptaah main honi he jisamen faisla liya janaa he ki pakistan ko blike list main rakhana he yaa phir baahar karnaa he
 In such a situation, Pakistan wants to mislead the world in the name of action by registering fake and half-baked cases against the terrorists

 Ram Gopal Yadav, the national general secretary of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh, has claimed that the state government has implemented its promise to release innocent jailed Muslims

 Lara Dutta will be seen doing something similar in the film Singh is Bling when she played Akshay and Amy's love story
 tippaniyan Actually, in the film 'singh is Bling', Akshay falls in love with Amy but the problem is when Akshay does not know English and Amy does not know Hindi
 aise main ye donon apni baat ek duusare ko bataane main asamarth rahete hai or tab unki zindagi main aati hai lara datta
 Lara Dutta's job is to reach Akshay Kumar's talk to Amy in English and translate Amy's talk in Hindi to Akshay
 magar chunki lara ko akshay pasand nahin hai isliye wo inke ishq ke bich daraar banaati hai or ek duusare kii kahi baton kaa ulta sidhaa anuwaad karti hai
 Since this is a comedy film, this role of Lara is said to be good and her translation is quite a comedy
 darasal film 'singh is bling' main akshay ko emi se pyaar ho jaataa he magar takaleef tab hoti he jab akshay ko angreji nahin aati or emi ko hindi nahin aati
 In such a situation, these two are unable to tell their point to each other and then Lara Dutta comes in their life

 During this time there has been a clash between farmers and traders in Suwasra
 vyapaariyon ne puure nagar ko anischitkaal ke liye anischitkaal band kar diya he
 Farmers of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh came out on the streets after being convinced of their problems and the government's anti-farmer policies
 is bich donon sarkaron or kisaan sanghathanon main sulah kii bhi khabaren ain, lekin phir andolan main foot pad gai or duusare dhadon ne andolan jari rakhaa he
 Now this movement seems to be intensifying
 1 june se chal rahaa he andolanmaharashtra main kisaanon ne fasal kharaab hone kii vajah se karj maafee tathaa emspi kii guarantee sahit vibhinn maangon ke liye ek june ko andolan shuru kiya tha
 The farmers of Maharashtra have started a movement against the Devendra Fadnavis government under the name 'kisan Kranti', so farmers in Madhya Pradesh have started the movement of not delivering goods to the mandis from June 1 to 10, taking their demand
 andolan kar rahe kisaanon ne ahmednagar jile main badi maatra main doodh haive par baha diya
 Farmers have warned that if their demands are not met, they will continue the movement
 kahaan se hui shuruyatmaharashtra main kisaan andolan kii shuruyaat ahamed nagar jile main godavari nadi ke kinare based punatamba gaanv se hui
 The first strike took place in this village
 ye hai kisaanon kii pramukh maangen- kisaanon ke sabhi karj maaf kiye jaaen- swaminathan ayog kii siforishein lagu kii jaae- kheti ke liye bina byaaj ke karj de sarkaar- 60 saal ke umr vaale kisaanon ko pension diya jaae- doodh ke liye prati litre 50 rupee milenasik bana nayaa centremumbai, thane, navi mumbai jaise ilaakon ko sabji or doodh kii aapurti karne vaala nasik kisaan andolan kaa nayaa centre ban gaya he
 Therefore, it is feared that if this movement does not end, then all these will have an impact on Mumbai and surrounding cities
 kisaan netaaon or sarkaar main sulah nahin hui to mumbai samet aasapaas ke shaharon main sankat gaharaa saktaa he
 Black marketing of all essential vegetables can begin in these cities
 kisaanon kii hadtaal sambandhit sabhi nirnay nasik main liye jaaenge, jisaki vajah se hadtaal main foot padane ke sanket dikh rahe hai
 After talking to farmer leaders on the night of unsuccessful attempt to reconcile, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra announced on Saturday that his government would forgive the debt of farmers with less land
 unhone kaha ki is kadam se vidarbha or marathavada ke aise 80 fisadi kisaanon ko laabh hoga
 After the agreement with the CM, the strike was announced by the Core Committee of Farmers of Puntamba, but on Monday, the farmers re-united with the call for Maharashtra bandh
 is andolan main foot pad gai
 a meeting of farmers 'leaders took place in Nashik to decide the future policy of the farmers' movement, in which it was decided to keep Maharashtra closed on 5 June
 kisaanon dwaara somvaar ko maharashtra band karne kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 On Monday, vehicles loaded with vegetables were stopped at many places and vegetables loaded in them were thrown on the streets
 isi tarah doodh kii gadiyon ko bhi rokkar doodh sadak par bahaya gaya
 Political parties have also started showing interest in the strike of political rangers
 rajya ke vibhinn sthanon main kisaanon ke andolan main rashtravaadi congress ke netaaon kii sakriy bhoomika najar ai
 Simultaneously, Shiv Sena also announced support for the strike
 shivasena kaaryakartaaon ne andolan ko sahyog dete hue osmanabad main chakkaa jam kiya
 Demonstration of farmers is still going on in many areas of Maharashtra
 sholapur main kisaanon ne mukhyamantri fadanvis kaa putala bhi jalaayaa or sir mundwakar virodh jataayaa
 The impact of the farmers' strike is seen in Rahuri in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra
 madhya pradesh ke kisaan andolan main bhi footmadhya pradesh main kisaanon kii hadtaal main siyasat haaavee ho gai he
 The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh has decided to end the agitation after talks with the Chief Minister, but other organizations have announced not to leave the agitation
 madhya pradesh ke kai kisaan sanghathan bhi 10 din kii hadtaal par hai
 The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has decided to end the agitation after talks with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, but the Bharatiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, the leaders in the agitation, announced not to leave the path of struggle is
 ujjain main baithak ke baad tay hua ki kisaan krishi upaj mandi main jo utpaada bechate hai, unka 50 fisadi unhen nakad milegaa jabaki 50 fisadi artijies ke zarie yani sidhaa unke bank khate main aayega
 It was also decided that the government would buy the moong crop at the support price
 kai or nirnay bhi kiye gaye
 After the meeting, Shivkant Dixit of Bhartiya Kisan Union announced that the movement is postponed as the government has accepted all their sayings
 vahiin rashtriya kisaan majdoor sangh ne is samjhaute kii tikhi aalochana karte hue kaha ki sarkaar is andolan se ghabaraakar aise hatkande apana rahi he, vahiin bhartiya kisaan union ne kaha ki hadtaal unke sanghathan ne shuru kii thi or khatm bhi vahi karenge
 Other groups are still on strike
 empi main andolan kii vajahmadhya pradesh kekisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko unke utpaada kaa vaazib daam nahin mil rahaa he
 The amount of money they are putting into growing their crops, they are not getting it to sell
 isse kisaan kii haalat bahut kharaab ho gai he or ve karj ke tale dabe hue hai
 The Madhya Pradesh government has fixed the minimum support price of wheat at Rs 1625 per quintal, but the government is not buying farmers' wheat at this price, due to which they have to sell their produce in the market at a price of Rs 1200 to Rs 1300 per quintal
 is
 isse zyada keemat par koi bhi kisaan se gehun kharidne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Onions and oranges are throwing away farmers due to the very low prices

 asia kii sabase badi pyaaj mandi maharashtra ke lasalgamv main paanch dinon kii bandi ke baad buudhvaar ko kaarobaar shuru hua he, lekin dhandha abhi bhi manda he
 Mandi businessman Sanjay Pardesi said, "the government's decision on demonetisation is good but it is causing a lot of difficulty in business
 abhi pyaaj kii mandi band thi lekin kisaan taiyaar nahin hai
 They say that even up to Rs 4000 will be changed in the bank, in which case they are not ready to take it
 aise main kisaan, vyapaaree or aadhati sabakaa baari nuksaan hua he
 Right now the old goods will come after the market starts, it will make a difference to the farmer
 sabji koi lene ko taiyaar nahin he, limit 1 xxrep 4 0 nahin balki vyapaaree ke liye 2-3 lakh ru
 Should be of ''tippaniyan There is an old stock in the market, business-buyer-farmer does not want to trade in 500-1000 note, yet onion has gone straight from Rs 8 / kg to Rs 20 / kg but farmers have clearly said that Will not accept checks

 Workers also do not take 500-1000, if we do not take shopkeepers, what should we do
 '' In Lasalgaon Mandi, only onion is bought and sold for about Rs 3 crore a day, the mandi across the country runs mostly on cash
 aise main badlaav ke liye sab taiyaar to dikhte hai lekin note ke badale card par aana thodaa mushkil lagata he
 Business started on Wednesday after a five-day shutdown in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra's largest onion market, but the business is still sluggish
 mandi ke kaarobaari sanjay paradesi ne kaha, "sarkaar ke notebandi kaa faisla acha he lekin isse vyapaar main bahut dikkat aa rahi he
 At present the onion market was closed but the farmers are not ready
 unka kahana he ki bank main bhi 4000 ru tak hi badale jaaenge aise main wo bhi lene ko taiyaar nahin he
 In such a situation, farmers, traders and jobseekers have all suffered greatly

 a viral Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) report on social media before the assembly elections has brought a storm in the politics of Madhya Pradesh
 RSS kii report main siem shivaraj or sarkaar ke mantriyon ke kaamkaaj par sawaal khadey kiye gaye hai
 This report, which went viral on social media in MP with the name of RSS, has given sleep to the ministers of Shivraj government including Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 vidhansabha chunaavse pehle viral ho rahi list main zyaadaatar mantriyon ke kaam-kaaj par asantosh jataayaa gaya he
 As soon as this list of two pages goes viral, the senses of the BJP leaders have been destroyed

 vahiin report main shivaraj sarkaar ke kai mantriyon kaa tikat kaat kisi or ko mauka dene kii baat kahi gai he
 BJP may have accused the Congress for this, but the Congress says that it has nothing to do with this report
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki ''isse pehle bhiaresasane khud kaha he ki 80 naam kaato aurshivaraj sinhako budhani se hataao, ye to aresas khud bol rahi he
 He said that Congress has no hand in this because the RSS and BJP have expertise in spreading lies
 chunaav se pehle soshal media par phek list kaa ye koi pehla maamla nahin he
 It started when an alleged list of Congress candidates went viral on social media which later turned out to be fake
 iske kuch hi din baad bijepi ummidavaaron kii suchi bhi soshal media par viral hui
 This list also turned out to be fake and after the fake report of ABSS went viral, it is certain that this time there is a lie on social media before the assembly elections

 upi main vidhansabha chunaav kii aahat ke bich jahaan ek ore nishkasit sapa netaa amar singh kii mulaayam singh yadav se nazdikiyaan badi hai, vahiin is vajah se party ke diggaj netaa ajam khan thode naaraaz bhi chal rahe hai
 In this whole matter, BJP says that this is happening because sp's trust in Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and the party is struggling with contradictions
 pradesh bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha, 'kabhi tosapa mukhiyaamar singh se nazdikiyaan darshaate hai
 Sometimes, they organize caste conferences
 kabhi mahagathbandhan kii baat kar usase palat jate hai
 This indicates that the party's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is losing trust
 ye saaf ho chalaa he ki 2017 ke chunaav sapa akhilesh yadav ke boote chunaav ladane kii sthiti main nahin he or vikalpon kii talash main uske antarvirodh khulkar saamne aa rahe hai
 "mulayam has lost the reins", Pathak further said, "while Mulayam Singh Yadav shows his love to Amar Singh, senior party leaders and ministers tell Azam Khan a garbage scam
 kul milakar spasht he kiparty ke bhitarkuch thik nahin chal rahaa he or netaa aapas main hi aarope pratyarope se jujh rahe hai, jis par sapa mukhiya mulaayam koi lagaam nahin laga paa rahe hai
 He said that how safe is the interest of the people of the state in the hands of the government of the ruling party suffering from contradictions
 -input bhashaa se Pakistan-based terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba has described the news published in the US media as baseless, stating that leading members of Lashkar have accepted their involvement in the conspiracy for the Mumbai terror attacks
 sanghathan par mumbai ke aatankwaadi hamalon kii sajeesh rachane kaa aarope he
 Lashkar has dismissed this news published in 'the Wall Street Journal'
 lashkar pravaktaa abdulla gaznavi ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha he ki america is sanghathan ke khilaaf jhuthe saboot gadhane main laga he
 This press release has probably been issued by the organization from Srinagar
 gaznavi ne kaha he ki bharat is cond main lashkar kii sanlippata hone ke apane daawey ke paksh main pukhta saboot juta nahin paaya, isliye america bharat kii marji ke mutabik hajaaron kilometre dur pakistan main lashkar ke khilaaf managasaint saboot jutaney main laga he
 Indian rail travel may cost you dearly
 haal hi main railway ne apni kamai badhaane or jarurat mandon ko tikat kii suvidha dene ke liye premium tatkaal seva shuru kii he
 Premium instant service is also available along with Tatkal service, the only difference is that Tatkal tickets are available at many times the price of Tatkal tickets
 railway ne haal mentatkaal tikatonki sankhya ko aadha karte hue un aadhe tikaton ko hawaiyatra kii tikaton kii tarj paradainmik prisingke tahat bechata he
 So, if a normal AC two-tier ticket from New Delhi to Allahabad costs you from around 1100 to 1200, it takes between 1400 and 1500 to take it on instant booking
 vahiin, agar tatkaal booking kii bhedchaal main aap ke hanth baaji nahin lagi to usee vakt premium tatkaal aapako lubhaa saktaa he
 If your journey is very important then you can book premium Tatkal tickets
 lekin, in tikaton ko book karaane main saavdhaanee zyada baratane kii jarurat he kyonki in tikaton kii keemat tikat book karaane ke aakhri second tak badhati he
 You get so much warning from the railway ticket booking website that: - “dynamic pricing is available in Premium Tatkal quota
 Fares may increase at the time of booking
 "so, while booking premium, keep in mind the price range of the ticket keeping in mind the dynamic pricing, as your ticket price will keep increasing till the money is deducted from your bank
 mujffarpur-sitamarhi sadak maarg par shanivaar ko bolero se 9 maasoom bacchon kii kuchalakar hui maut ke maamle main sthaneey bijepi netaa kaa naam saamne aa rahaa he
 The accused is being told to BJP leader Manoj Baitha who is the District General Secretary of Sitamarhi
 darasal, 9 bacchon kii maut jis bolero se hui uske aage bijepi kaa board laga hua tha
 On which Manoj sat, the state minister (mahadalit Manch) was written
 bijepi netaa kaa naam saamne aane ke baad jis jagah paraghatna ghativehaan ke sthaneey logon ne kaha ki unhone durghatana ke vakt manoj baitha ko bolero gaadi se nikalate dekha tha
 Since this accident, the leader Manoj Baitha and the driver of the Bolero car are absconding
 haalanki, bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki manoj baitha kaa bhaajapa se koi bhi conection he
 Party Vice President Devesh Kumar said that no person named Manoj Baitha is a state minister of bjp's Mahadalit Manch
 ab ye baat saamne aa gai he ki manoj baitha bijepi kaa netaa he or vah sitamarhi jile kaa mahaamantri he
 RJD leader Tejaswi Yadavavanishwar reached Shri Krishna Memorial Hospital in Muzaffarpur in the evening where he consoled the families of 9 innocent children killed in the incident
 is dauraan tejasvi yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki is puri ghatana main bijepi netaa manoj baitha or unka driver shaamil he
 Tejashwi also said that the driver of the Bolero vehicle had drunk alcohol
 jisaki vajah se uski gaadi aniyantrit ho gai or itani badi durghatana ho gai
 Drunk BJP state minister brutally crushed 9 innocent school children
 kahan he naitikta ke lambardaar nitish kumaar? susheel modi & gang aaj bill main chuphi hui he
 BJP and JDU boycotted the media today on this very sensitive and human issue

 com / 2cn1tzhekl— Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi)february 24, 2018tejasvi ne mujffarpur police par bhi sawaal uthaae or poocha ki ghatana hone ke itane ghante ke baad bhi bolero gaadi kaa driver or bijepi netaa manoj baitha ko police pakad kyon nahin pai he? tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya ki bihar sarkaar manoj baitha ko bachaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Tejashwi also raised the question that from where did the driver of the Bolero vehicle get liquor while prohibition is in force in the state? purv champion france ko gol karne ke kuch behtareen maukey ganvaane ke kaaran urugway ke khilaaf vishwa cap footbal ke group e main apana pehla match aaj yahaan golrahit dra khelnaa padaa
 This is the third consecutive occasion for France, who became champions in 1998 on their own land, while their team failed to score in their opening match of the World Cup
 asal main francisi team ne apane desh se baahar khele gayi vishwa cap ke pehle match main aakhri baar 1986 main gol kiya tha
 The French team had some good opportunities to break this myth today, but were forced to eventually score points at the packed Green Point Stadium
 yahaan tak urugway ke sthanapann khilaadi nicholas lodero ko 81wein minute main laal card(duusare pile card ke kaaran) milane se france ko aakhri das minute main das khilaadiyon kii chunauti se paar paanaa tha lekin vah iskaa phayda uthaane main naakaam rahaa
 France had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the eighth minute when Frank Ribérye gave a pass to striker Sydney Gowu from the left but failed to hit the target
 govu 2008 se ab tak france ke liye gol nahin kar paye hai or ek baar phir se vah chook gayi jiskaa dabaav un par saaf dikhaa jiske kaaran vah sateek shaat nahin laga paye 
 Two minutes later, the shot of Abo Diabi also went out
 jab antim siti bajane main mahaj teen minute kaa samay bachaa tha tab aanari ko golmukh ke paas gend mili thi lekin unka shaat urugway ke dephender kii baanh se laga jiske liye francisi team ne penlti kii maang kii lekin referi ne use nakaar diya
 Uruguay initially struggled to regain rhythm
 use gol karne kaa pehla avasar 17wein minute main mila jab captain digo forlan ko baks ke kinare par gend mili lekin daayen paanv se lagaaye gayi unke karaare shaat ko golkeeper hugo loris ne hatheli bhidaakar baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Two minutes later, French playmaker Yoan Gourcuff made a good shot on a free kick but Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Mouslera saved it quickly
 iske baad pehle half kaa khel midfield main hi simata rahaa tathaa antim 15 minute main to kisi bhi team ne gol kii taraf badhane kii koshish nahin kii
 Uruguay captain Fourlain had a chance to give his team an edge in the 74th minute but his shot went out on a pass from Louis Suarez
 forlan ne acchhee farm dikhaayi lekin unhen anya khilaadiyon se paryaapt sahyog nahin mila
 Meanwhile Dominek replaced Thierry Aaneri in the 72nd minute in place of Anelka
 yah unka vishwa cap main 16waan match he or vah fabian barthej ke 17 match ke francisi ricard ko todane ke kareeb pahunch gayi hai
 France's Patrick Evra, Ribéry and Toulalan, while Uruguay's Marcio Victorino and Diogo Lugano received yellow cards
 urugway ke lodiro keval 16 minute maidan par rahe lekin is bich unhen do baar pilaa card dekhnaa padaa or unki team ko is vajah se aakhir kuch minute main apni puri takat gol bachaane par lagaani padi
 While France could not break the myth of not scoring goals in the opening match of the World Cup, the myth of not getting the result of the first round match between the two former champions was associated with the World Cup
 vishwa cap main yah aathvaan avasar tha jabaki do purv vijeta timen pehle daur main ek duusare ke aamane saamne thi
 Matches were drawn on six of these occasions

 The political speculation for Nitish's candidature on this post and the political infighting on him has just started
 congress or sapa ko chhod den to zyaadaatar partiyaan nitish ke samarthan main dikh rahi hai
 NCP chief Sharad Pawar has described Nitish Kumar as the most qualified candidate
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ke mukaable nitish zyada yogya or behatar ummidavaar honge
 Read- The list of 'PM in waiting' is getting longer; those are five circumstances, on the basis of which Nitish Kumar can become a strong contender for the post of Prime Minister
 modi ke mukaable koi or cheharaa nahingale loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi narendra modi kii aguwai main hi dobaaraa satta main aane kaa dam bhar rahi he, jabaki vipaksh ke paas modi ke mukaable nitish kumaar ke alaava koi bada cheharaa nahin ho jo takkar de sake
 Nitish Kumar has become the CM of Bihar for the fifth time
 unamem shashan ko lekar samaj to he hi saath hi vah ranneetik rup se bhi majboot hai
 His image is absolutely clear
 2
 congress-sp is not getting anyone, Congress has opposed Nitish's claim
 congress kisi or party ke netaa ko pradhanmantri pad dene ke liye raji nahin he
 But the other parties are quite confident about Nitish Kumar and are also supporting him directly and indirectly
 aise main congress akeli padati dikh rahi he or nitish kaa palada baari he
 RJD and TMC, which were earlier partners at the Center, are also seen to be leaving the Congress hand in this matter
 3
 The Bihar election is also a great victory because of the grand victory of the Grand Alliance in Bihar and the strong defeat of the BJP has further strengthened Nitish's image among the public
 modi lahar ke sahare chunaav ladane vaali bijepi ko is haar se bada jhatka laga he or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii saakh ko bhi batta laga
 The face of this victory was Nitish Kumar
 isse janata ke bich unki chhavi or behatar hui
 4
 teesraa morcha bana to nitish kii daavedaari pakkibihar chunaav main jeet ke baad ab 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main teesraa morcha yaa mahagathbandhan ke taur par kai partiyon ke ekajute hone ke puri ummid he
 If this happens, Nitish Kumar will be the prime ministerial candidate
 argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke baad ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne bhi unhen is pad kii daavedaari ke liye sabase yogya ummidavaar bataaya he
 Nitish is also likely to have the support of Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee
 5
 There are also secular votes, caste strategies and effective decisions because Nitish Kumar has carved out his image as a secular leader
 bihar chunaavon main unhen mili voton se yah baat saaf bhi hoti he
 Be it a minority or an OBC vote bank, Nitish left no stone unturned to help every section
 aarakshan kaa mudda ho yaa phirpurn sharabbandi kaa elaan, nitish ne bihar ke vikaas model ko ek baar phir chamakaane kii purajor koshish kii he
 Nitish has made a deep penetration among the public by his decisions which will strengthen his claim

 Arun Sureshkumar, a computer science student living in Kollam, Kerala, has exposed a major flaw in the Facebook page
 unhone ajtak kii website ko bataaya ki he yah khami itani gambhir he ki iske jariye president obama se lekar bill gates tak ke fasebuk pej hack kiye ja sakate the or unhen isaki khabar tak nahin hoti
 Apart from this, he has exposed many of the flaws of Facebook, which Facebook has given him a reward of more than 30 lakh rupees so far
 haal hi main fasebuk ne unhen 16 hajaar dollar inaam diya he
 Earlier he had found the bug in Facebook login for which he was given 10,000 dollars
 unke mutabaki 2013 se abhi tak unhen fasebuk ne 46,000 dollar (lagbhag 30 lakh rupee) die hai
 It is worth noting that earlier two young men of India, Anand Prakash and Yogesh Tantak, have also received reward from Facebook by exposing such serious flaws of Facebook
 arun sureshkumar ke mutabaki unhone fasebuk pej kii ek aisi khami ko ujagar kiya he jiske jariye havers kisi fasebuk pej ko aasaani se hack karke uske galag istemaal kar sakate the
 These could also include the official Facebook accounts of PM Modi, Bill Gates and US President Obama
 aapako bataa den ki fasebuk bijness pej kaa ek feechar he jiske jariye pej kaa maalik duusare logon ko pej chalaane ke liye isamen unhen aid kar saktaa he
 Sureshkumar found flaws in this feature and first created a business page from his account and managed to hack through a simple tool
 is tarah kii khaamiyon ko 'jiro de khami' bhi kaha jaataa he jisamen kisianjaan khami kii vajah se kisisoftare or hardware ke jariye kisi ke acount ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 In this type of hacking, the real account holders do not even know that their account has been hacked
 arun sureshkumar ne bhi fasebuk pej main jiro de khami ko ujagar kiya he
 He told us, 'it was quite easy to hijack the official Facebook account of any organization or celebrity
 fasebuk bijness manager ke jariye ek fasebuk pej ke kai admin banaae ja sakate hai
 In this feature, i found a flaw and Facebook has patched it quickly and has given me a reward of 16 thousand dollars'
 It has exposed many flaws before that
 They have told us that since 2013 they have exposed 4 flaws so far
 khaas baat yah rahi ki iske liye na to unhen koi certifoidaiking course jarurat padior nahi kisi training kii
 He has said that he will continue to highlight the flaws of platforms like Facebook and Google as part time and also continue his studies

 It was expected that Obama would appreciate that he would give as much importance and priority to India as was given by former President George Bush

 As a result, there have been small understandings on various subjects like education, health, agriculture and science, which have taken bilateral relations to a new height, but nothing has happened that can be called very important or remarkable

 "another former Indian ambassador to the US, Narvash Chandra, says:" Obama described Manmohan Singh's visit as satisfactory and India as a natural partner of America, so his expressions were full of enthusiasm
 yah sambandhon ko aage badhaane kaa mauka tha
 The biggest "big" loss on the diplomatic front was Obama's pressing attempt to achieve equality between India and China after signing a joint statement with Beijing
 america-china ke us saz bayaan par dilli ne nakhushi jataai thi
 Walking back and forth on the wrong steps taken earlier, Obama said in a joint press conference, "india is a fast growing and responsible power

 The US welcomes and encourages the Indian leadership role in promoting peace and stability in Asia

 But when it comes to supporting India's candidature in the UN Security Council, according to Mansingh, Obama does not say anything clear on this matter and makes big statements without any commitment
 china ke alaava videsh niti se sambandhit ek or mudda jo daure main pramukhataa se ubhara, vah tha afghanistan ko lekar badhati anischitata kaa
 During the meeting, Obama also corrected the notion that India's involvement in building infrastructure in Afghanistan is of no use as it has angered Pakistan, stemming from the statements of the US general in charge of the US campaign in Afghanistan
 afghanistan main bharat kii bhoomika kaa samarthan karte hue obama is disha main aage badhkar or baat karne ke icchhuk nahin dikhe ki isamen masale main bharat kaa or kya yogadan ho saktaa he jisamen sambhavit rup se afghanistan ke suraksha balon ko prashikshan dena bhi shaamil he
 On the issue of Pakistan, Obama insisted on punishing those responsible for the Mumbai attacks

 In a joint effort, Manmohan Singh and Obama announced a counter-terrorism joint initiative to "increase cooperation on counter-terrorism, share information and build capacity"
 lekin dharna vahi kii vahi rahi ki obama ne pakistan par utana dabaav nahin banaaya jitna bharat chahta tha
 The completion of the nuclear agreement - the true task will be fulfilled in Manmohan Singh's visit, it also proved to be wrong
 mana ja rahaa he ki america ne parmaanu aprasar kii jarurat ke or adhik vivaran tathaa aashwaasan die jane par jor diya he jiske kaaran donon hi paksh pun:prasanskaran se sambandhit samajhaite par nahin pahunch paae hai
 The Indian side did not give much attention to the issue and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, "the President has reaffirmed that it is the resolve of our two governments to implement the nuclear deal as soon as possible
" bas kuch or aupchaariktaayen puraa karnaa baaki he

 The time of the visit will not be any less beneficial for the Obama administration, as the tour comes at a time when the US is staggering on a faltering economy, 10 percent extra unemployment, two heavy-spending and unsustainable battles and health care billions of dollars

 bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani sansad main kabhi prakhar vaktaa maane jate rahe hai
 But now a lot of water has flowed into the Yamuna and their world has changed completely
 sansad main unka bolnaa lagaataar kam ho rahaa he
 Advani's spoken words have fallen by 99 per cent in the current i
e
 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19) as compared to the 15th Lok Sabha (2009-14)
 sansad main pichley paanch saal main adwani sirf 365 shabd bol paae hai
 On 8 August 2012, the Bharatiya Janata Party moved a stay motion in the Lok Sabha
 mudda tha assam main badhati gaiyrkanoonee ghuspaith (illegal infiltration) or ho rahi jaateey hinsa (ethnic vaayalence)
 Lal Krishna Advani, the 'iron man' of the BJP, was leading the opposition debate
 sadan ke dastavej ye bataate hai ki bahes ke dauraan sadan main kaaphi shor sharaaba rahaa
 Manmohan Singh's UPA-II government was not in favor of the House postponing its daily proceedings to discuss the situation in Assam
 shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa hoga ki sadan main nirantar avrodh dekhne ko mili
 But Advani was not deterred by his speech
 satta paksh ne avrodh badhaayaa par adwani bolte rahe
 This was not a new challenge for Lal Krishna Advani
 aapane lambey raajnneetik safar main unhone aise kai paristhitiyon kaa muqabla kiya
 Advani's speech was about 5000 words
 loksabhaa ke dastavej dikhaate hai ki is bhaashan ke dauraan kam se kam 50 vyavdhaan the
 In the end the House turned down the opposition's proposal, but Advani had said what he wanted to say
 Also Read: In 5 years, LK Advani uttered only 365 words in Parliament despite 92% attendanceisa sandarbh main ek or taarikh khaas he, 8 janvari, 2019
 Another day of Lok Sabha, debate and rest of the disruption
 yah koi nai baat nahin rahi
 The special thing was that the Narendra Modi government of the BJP was presenting a bill in the Lok Sabha
 bill kaa naam tha citijanship emendament bill
 Its purpose? The Modi government believes that refugees who come from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, be it Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis or Christians, should get Indian citizenship
 is bill kaa assam kii saamaajik evam raajnneetik sthiti par khaasaa asar pad saktaa he
 Its strings are directly linked to decades of illegal infiltration and ethnic violence in Assam
 jis din yah bill loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya or bahes ke baad sadan ne ise paarit kiya, laal krishna adwani bhi sabha main upasthit the
 But Advani remained silent during the discussion
 yah vahi adwani the jinhone 8 varsh purv, 50 vyavadhaanon ko darkinar kar, assam kii samasya par sadan main apana mat rakhaa tha
 2008 to 2018 i
e
 8 year gap
 is dauraan kaaphi kuch badal gaya he
 Government has changed, political climate has changed and Lal Krishna Advani has changed
 adwani kii vakkshamtaloksabhaa ke dastavejon kaa moolyankan karne par yah pataa chalata he ki pichley 5 varshon main loksabhaa main adwani ne keval 365 shabd bole
 If we compare this with the 15th Lok Sabha (2009-14), it is found that in the 16th Lok Sabha, there has been a 99 per cent decline in the words spoken by Advani in the House
 san 2009 or 2014 ke bich adwani ne 42 bahes main bhaag lete hue 35,926 shabd bole
 On the other hand, all the 365 words that Advani has spoken in the 16th Lok Sabha were spoken in 2014
 loksabhaa ke dastavej bataate hai ki adwani ne 19 disambar 2014 ko loksabhaa main apana aakhri bhaashan diya
 If you are thinking that Advani is among those who do not like to speak much, then you are in misunderstanding
 adwani ne apni aatmakatha, My Country My Life, likhi to apane jivan par 1,000 se adhik panne likh daale
 It shows that they have a lot to say
 loksabhaa ke dastavej, jo uski websit par uplabdh hai, yah dikhaate hai ki laal krishna adwani-ek aisa vyakti, jo 11 baar sansad kaa sadsy rahaa, jisane atal bihari vaajapeyi ke saath milakar bhartiya janata party kii sthapana kii, jo aaj bhaajapa kaa sabase varisht netaa he, jiske balboote yah party desh bhar main majboot hui- us vyakti ke paas 5 saal main bolne ko bas 365 shabd hi the
 In the last 5 years, Advani participated in the Lok Sabha debate 5 times
 inamen se 2 maukey the spikar or dipti spikar kaa chunaav
 During this, Advani gave speeches, but stopped his speech by saying 'I support this proposal'
 (iske vipareet 6 june 2009 ko jaraa yaad kiijie
 In the Lok Sabha, Advani was greeting Meera Kumar when he was elected speaker
 apane bhaashan main unhone 440 shabd kahe
 These were 75 words more than the previous 5 years
 )iske alaava adwani ne 2 sansadeey cameti kii report sadan main pesh kii
 In the meantime, he only completed the formality and read the name of the report and said 'I place it on the table'
 5veen baar jab adwani loksabhaa main bole to sadan kashmir par charchaa kar rahaa tha, mudda tha kashmir main sharnaarthiyon kaa
 Advani referred to an old report in his short speech and requested the House to consider how it could be implemented
 bas yah he kabhi bhaajapa ke ‘louh purush’ rahe laal krishna adwani kii pichhele 5 saal main loksabhaa kii kahani
 If we talk about time, Advani would have taken about 3 minutes to speak 365 words
 adwani kaa yun achaanak desh ke raajnneetik galiyaaron se gum ho janaa unki dhalati umr kaa nateeja nahin he
 The truth is that even though Advani is 91 years old, his presence in Parliament is still unmatched
 pichley 5 varshon main adwani kii loksabhaa main upasthiti 92 fisadi rahi he
 There were 16 sessions of the Lok Sabha between June 4, 2014 and January 8, 2019
 kul milakar lok sabha ne 321 din kaam kiya
 296 of these 321 days (92
 21%) din adwani sadan main upasthit the
 This figure is more than many ministers, top speakers of today's BJP and leaders of the opposition
 darasal, adwani kaa 16veen loksabhaa main upasthiti kaa aankada 15veen lok sabha se bhi 1 fisadi adhik he
 Now if we talk about Advani's last 21 years of parliamentary life, then the Lok Sabha documents show that between 1998 and 2019, Advani was a part of 5 Lok Sabha (12th to 16th)
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main wo number do the or manmohan singh ke adhikansh shashan main wo vipaksh ke netaa rahe
 Today, even though Advani sits in the first row of Parliament, now he is no longer the first Advani whose roar would ever echo
 pichley 21 saal ke loksabhaa ke dastavej darshaate hai ki 1998 se 2019 ke dauraan adwani ne kul 300 bahes main bhaag liya
 But only 5 of these (1
 6 fisadi) hi maujuuda loksabhaa kaa tha
 Between March 21, 1998 and April 15, 1999 (12th Lok Sabha), when the BJP was in power, within a year, Advani participated in 57 debates
 agali loksabhaa main adwani vaajapeyi ke number do ke netaa the or is dauraan (1999-2004) unhone 179 bahason main bhaag liya
 During the UPA i government (2004–2009), Advani participated in 74 debates as a leader of the opposition
 agle 5 varsh (2009-14) main unhone 42 bahason main apni bhagidaari di
 Now if we look at the current Lok Sabha, between June 2014 and January 2019, there were 16 sessions of the Lok Sabha
 inamen adwani ne lagbhag 3 minute baat kii
 Are the shoulders carrying the burden of security now bent? The latest figures of the Ministry of Home Affairs presented in the Rajya Sabha are saying the same
 darasal aksar vipareet paristhitiyon main kaam karne vaale kendriya suraksha balon ke javaanon ke naukari chhodane kaa silsilaa tamaam sarkari prayaason ke baavjood rukne kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs gave this information in response to a question asked in Rajya Sabha
 sawaal poocha gaya tha ki kya varsh 2015 kii tulana main varsh 2017 main apni naukari chhodane vaale ardhsainik balon ke adhikariyon or javaanon kii sankhya main lagbhag 500% kii vruddhi dekhi gai he? iske jawaab mengrih mantralayane likhit jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki varsh 2017 main apni naukari chhodane vaale kendriya sashastr police balon or assam rifles ke adhikariyon or javaanon kii sankhya varsh 2015 main 3,425 kii tulana main 14,587 he
 Let us know that the government's concerns are increasing due to the leaving of such a large number of jobs by central security forces
