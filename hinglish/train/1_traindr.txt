 vah baar baar kehete rahe ki lakhanu kii sarkaar ko badalanaa hoga, tabhi kuch hoga
 He mentioned BJP only once and said that he opposed the Right to Food Bill in Parliament
 apane bundelkhand pravaas kaa zikr kiya or bole ki maine yahaan lambey daure kiye
 Today there is no mention of mosquitoes and water
 maa-daadi ke kisson kaa zikr nahin hua
 Just repeatedly asked the youth that you got a job
 sadak mili, bijli mili
 Along with this, Rahul Gandhi also claimed that after seeing the bad condition of Bundelkhand, in 2009, the UPA government had given a loan waiver of 70 thousand crores to the farmers throughout the country
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki unki sarkaar se pehle kisaanon ko bank main nahin ghusane dete the
 They used to say that debt is on you, cannot come in
 baharhaal
 
 
 Here is the speech given by Rahul Gandhi in Hamirpur
 
 
 hamane pichley 10 saalon main kya kiya
 The poor who are standing here know this

 Millions of crores got employment

 We guaranteed them 100 days of employment
 thik he
 Then talk of corruption
 vipaksh kahata he bhrashtachar kii baat karte hai
 We gave you RTI
 pehle jo sawaal aap kabhi nahin puch sakate the
 Now you can go and ask the officers
 jo bhrashtachar pehle band kamaron main hota tha, ab baahar aa gaya
 Who brought this law
 nahin, jor se bolo, koun laayaa is kanoon ko
 We brought the greatest law
 bhojan kaa adhikaar
 The women who are sitting here
 unhen samaj he
 Ask them unke dil main dard hota he, jab unke bachche bhukhe jate hai
 Is it true or not
 ab hamane guarantee kar kaha he
 Nobody will be hungry
 kya kaha he, sun lo
 Even if it is dry there
 kuch bhi ho
 The government will give food grains in whole of India for one rupee
 lambii ladaai lade ham
 In the Parliament, the people of the opposition say, no brother, there is no use
 bijepi ke bade netaa kehete hai, koi phayda nahin, jarurat nahin
 And in Uttar Pradesh, in Bundelkhand, where it is most needed, your government says, UP government
 nahin bhaiya
 Those who do not implement it before the election
 kya bhukh chunaav ke baad hogi kya
 Is there no appetite today? dekhie, aap in par dabaav daaliye
 This is your right jo upi kii janata he
 We have sent food for them
 parivaar main har vyakti ke liye bhojan bhej rahe hai
 Most people are going to benefit in UP
 jab main yahaan aata hum
 And i see thousands of young people here
 bombai chale jaao
 Go to Delhi upi ke hajaaron lakhon yuva milte hai
 When the Samajwadi Party came here, what did we say, we will provide employment here
 vaada kiya tha ki nahin
 You got employment koi yahaan yuva he, jo kah saktaa ho ki upi kii sarkaar ne use rojgaar diya
 If you want employment
 agar aapako upi main rojgaar chahie to infrastracchar kii, sadakon kii railway line kii jarurat he
 Who will bring this? dekhie ye dilli kii sarkaar aapako paisa bhej sakati he
 The Congress Party government is in Delhi
 ham yahaan hajaaron karod rupee bhejte hai, sadakon ke liye bheja
 Sent the package, but it does not come in your hand
 gaayab ho jaataa he
 So unless you bring Congress Party government here, it will not change

 The work that we do on that day in Maharashtra, in Kerala, in Rajasthan, will be able to do that work in UP
 ham uttar pradesh ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 This is the largest state of India, as much power is here among the youth, there is nowhere else

 It is a matter of education, you have to go outside, it is a matter of health, you have to go out
 sadaken banati hai, chah maheene main tut jaati hai
 You brought the SP government here in 2012
 magar jo aapako milanaa chahie tha, wo nahin mila
 not found
 or yahaan ekh yuva chif ministar hai
 Work can be done
 uttar pradesh ko badla ja saktaa he
 But the voice of Bundelkhand will have to be heard
 jo bundelkhand saalon se chilla rahaa he, use sunanaa hoga
 The Government of Delhi listened to you
 vahaan tak aapaki gunj pahunch gai
 i have spent nights, nights in the village
 lambey daure kiye
 Front Back
 magar aapaki jo aawaaj he, wo lakhanu tak nahin pahunchati
 Reaches Delhi
 2009 main aapke kisaanon ko ksht ho rahaa tha
 You told us, look

 The voice came out of Bundelkhand and waived 70 thousand crore loan in entire India
 or shakti di aapako
 Farmers used to say, look brother, big people enter the bank
 hamen kah dete hai ki tumhaare upar karja he, tum andar nahin aa sakate
 So brother, help you need from Delhi
 ham aapke saath khadey hai, madad karne kii koshish karenge
 But our dream is your dream
 ham bundelkhand ko khadaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Want to give power to these youth

 The Congress raised many questions over the government's 'abrupt' decision to stop the circulation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes and raised concerns that it would cause a lot of problems for businessmen, small traders and housewives
 party ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne haalanki spasht kiya ki party hameshaa kaale dhan ke mudde par 'arthpurna, spasht or sateek' kadamon kaa samarthan karegi

 Ramnik Mahajan, director of Max Hospital, Saket Orthopedics, said that by the time they reach the age of 50, Indian women start suffering from knee and bone mass degeneration problems
 bhartiya mahilaon main arthritis ke jaldi hone kii vajah poshak tatwon kii kami or motopa he
 Here is the suggestion of Ramanik Mahajan, who can take better care of mothers by adopting it
 1
 Quickly recognize warning signs: You may have seen your mother complaining about joint pain, stiffness, and then ignoring it as a sign of aging
 aise main visheshgy se vichaarvimarsh karen
 From the onset of early morning pain, stiffness, locking and popping in the knees to swelling in the joints, these can be signs of arthritis which is a progressive joint condition and most Indian women ignore these signs
 2
 Identification at the right time: Women go to the doctor only when the condition reaches such a stage when the pain becomes unbearable
 yaad rakhen ki deree hone se jodon ko hone vaala nuksaan kai guna badha saktaa he
 If it is treated in the initial stages, then the condition can be delayed with the help of traditional treatments
 3
 Weight Gain: Overweight is one of the most prominent risk factors for arthritis in Indian women
 hamaare jod kuch had tak vajan uthaane ke liye dizin hai
 Each 1 kg of extra weight can put four times the pressure on the knees
 kshamta se adhik vajan jodon ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he isliye uchit vajan kaa matlab he swasth jod
 4
 30 minute kii vaak :har din 30 minute kii walk haddiyon evam jodon ke swasthya ke liye laabhadaayak ho sakati he
 5
 choti-moti choton ko gambhirtha se len :ham jodon ke aasapaas lagi choti-moti choton ko aksar nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 This can cause harmful conditions, such as arthritis in the future
 yadi dard baar-baar ho rahaa he to visheshgy kii salaah len
 We often see patients where joint injury causes joint degeneration
 6
 Keep an eye on body posture: Incorrect posture causes extra burden on the joints, especially the knee
 ghutane sharir main sabase adhik bhaar sahan karne vaale jod hai
 This may cause knee pain
 sahi poshchar rakhana, kaam ke dauraan bich-bich main brake lenaa, niyamit rup se streacing karnaa or apane poshchar ko bich-bich main thik karne se ghutane ke dard ko kam karne main madad milti he
 7
 penkilors ko kahen naa :hamaare desh main khud se dawaaen lenaa ek aam samasya he
 Usually, we often resort to painkillers without consulting a doctor if there is body pain
 penkilors bhale hi hamen dard se fouran raahat dilaate hai par, vah sthiti kaa upachaar nahin karte
 This can lead to many co-morbid conditions, so if you see your mom taking painkillers on her own for joint pain, go to an orthopedist and get them tested immediately

 you hold on to, like your life depends on them
 This was one army rule we all strictly lived by, through the Shoot of the Film
 Once in costume, each and every one of us was responsible for our own gears
 You wear them or hold them, it’s going to be with you through the span of the Shoot for that day
 Our pockets would be full of protein bars, nuts and bags with bottles of energy drinks, because deep in those jungles sometimes no food trolleys or spot team were allowed to reach
 Somedays i would wake up with my right index finger already bent imitating to pull the trigger
 Those night shoots full of intense action, ofcourse were peppered with some fun banter and laughs in between shots amongst the boys, where our director @adityadharfilms would also join us
 All of this feels worth it, with the generous love the Film is getting from you all
 We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for keeping the Josh so high
 Also, a big shout out to the wonderful set of co-actors i got to work with, that formed our SF team

 from conference meetings to marriage ceremonies
 
 
 from a 92 years old grandmother to a 2 years old kid
 
 
 from even our Jawaans in the armed forces
 It’s not just a line anymore, you all have turned it into an emotion

 In such a situation, it is a great time for those who have fun by taking leave, but this rain is also opening the way for early winter and warning Delhi, who is suffering from dengue, to stay away from diseases

 com / y3h7tcas2h yogendra yadav ke twit ko lekar hangaamaa ho rahaa he, lekin use dhyaan se dekhne kii zarurat he
 He wrote, 'congress should be finished
 agar wo bharat ke vichaar kii raksha ke liye bijepi ko in chunaavon main roak paane main naakaam rahi to is party ke liye bhartiya itihaas main koi sakaaratmak bhoomika nahin he
 Today, it is representative of the biggest obstacle in making a choice
 ' jab logon ko laga ki yogendra yadav congress kii kisi sakaaratmak bhoomika se hi inkaar kar rahe hai to unhone phir spasht kiya ki ve ateet main congress ke aitihaasik yogadan kii baat nahin kar rahe, aane vaale dinon main uski bhoomika kii charchaa kar rahe the
 However, this is not the first time that someone has indicated the need for the Congress to end
 ab yah baat sarvavidit he ki sabase pehle mahatma gandhi ne hi congress ko khatm karne or isaki jagah lok sevak sangh gathit karne kaa suzav diya tha
 The issue arose within the Congress after the assassination of Gandhiji, but the circumstances arising immediately after the attainment of independence were no longer such that any outline of the immersion of the Congress could be formed
 iske baad congress ke khatme kaa suzav to nahin aayaa, lekin uske khatm ho jane kii bhavishyavaanee kai baar hui
 In 1967, when non-congress governments were formed in nine states for the first time, it was said that the Congress was over
 1969 main jab congress tuuti tab kaha gaya ki ab congress nahin bachegi
 After the defeat of Indira Gandhi in 1977, it was assumed that the Congress was indeed over
 1984 main indira gandhi kii mrityu ke baad maan liya gaya ki ab congress nahin lautegi
 With the fall of Narasimha Rao's government in 1996 and the beginning of coalition politics, it has been predicted that the return of the Congress is now impossible
 1998 ke baad raajnneeti main nai-nai ai sonia gandhi kaa lagbhag usee tarah mazaaq banaaya jaataa tha jis tarah pichley kuch varshon main rahul gandhi kaa banaaya jaataa rahaa he
 But the Congress kept on living like a miracle again and again
 lohia jaise darshanik-rajaneta kaa samaajwaad peeche chhot gaya or bainkon, koyale khaanon kaa rashtriyakaran karne se lekar garibi hataao tak kaa naaraa dene vaali congress aage bad gai
 The second independence of 1977 and the entire revolution of Jayaprakash fell victim to the accident and Indira Gandhi returned to power
 1984 main rajeev gandhi kii haar kii ghoshnaa karne vaale maafi maangane ko majaboor hue or bijepi do siton tak simat kar rah gai
 In 2004, Sonia Gandhi's Congress returned by defeating atal-advani's giant looking pair
 akhir yah koun si sanjivani he jo congress ko baar-baar jila detii he? kya yah azaadi kii ladaai se kamaaya hua punya he jo ab tak kaam aa rahaa he? 30 saal pehle yah baat sahi lag sakati thi lekin ab vah peedi ja chuki he jisane azaadi kii ladaai dekhi he yaa apane bado se uski kahaniyaan suni hai
 Now the generation who reads the whatsapp message, not the books, and most of these messages are going to dismiss the legacy of independence and the spirit, its leaders, Gandhi and Nehru
 darasal is sawaal ke jawaab main phir se yogendra yadav ke twit ko dekhne kii zarurat he
 Why do they want to end the Congress? He says, if the Congress is unable to preserve the idea of india, then it does not mean to survive
 yani yah congress kii nahin, bharat ke vichaar kii chintaa he jisaki vajah se ve aisa bayaan dete hai
 What is this idea of india - the idea of india? This idea is a pluralistic-multicultural-multicultural-multilingual India
 is vichaar main koi ek dharmik paddati, koi ek bhashaa, koi ek samskruti sirf apane bahusankhyak hone ke aadhaar par duusare dharmon, duusari bhashaaon or samskritiyon ko doum darje kaa nahin maanati, balki yah maanati he ki bharat naam kaa vichaar sabake mail se, sabaki barabari se or sabaki saajhedaari se phulataa-faltaa he
 This idea does not arise suddenly any night
 yah vichaar samvidhan naam kii kitaab main yon hi kisi siddhant kii tarah apana nahin liya gaya he
 This idea has developed between the internal encounter and dynamic of India's five thousand-year history
 isamen ek hi saath aapas main pratisparddha karte, kai baar takaraate or kai baar ek-duusare ko majboot banaate kai vishwaas paley hai- sanathan parampara main vaishnav, shaiva, shakt jaisi aasthaaen hai to buddha or jain dharm bhi hai, baad main aae islam, parsi or isai bhi isi parampara kaa hissaa hai
 Islam of India is not the same as Islam of Arabia
 vah theth bhartiya mausam main viksit hua phool he jise yaheen kii hawa-pani-khaad-mitti mili hui he
 If we look at the Christians living in the tribal areas of India, then there is no difference between them and the tribal groups
 beshak, is saanskrithik bahulata kii raah main tarah-tarah kii saamaajik kattartaaon ke avrodh bhi the
 Apart from untouchability, hindu-muslim competition was also a problem of Indian society
 lekin is samasya se ladane vaale, iskaa mazaaq banane vaale log bhi rahe
 If these people were not there, who would have saved Kabir, who would have remembered? How could Amir Khusro become an integral part of India's cultural-classical tradition? In the era of the freedom struggle, but India built its mind among this pluralistic tradition
 mahatma gandhi ne apni prarthana sabhaaon ke liye jo bhajan chune, ve sab madhya kaal ke kaviyon ke yahaan se chune- ve veda richaon ke aakarshan or aatank main nahin pade
 He knew where the soul of India resides
 1933 main ek baar jab unhen giraftaar kiya gaya to magistrate ne poocha ki ve koun hai
 Gandhi did not call himself a soldier of freedom or a saint, he said that he is a weaver - weaver
 ek hi jatke main unhone khud ko or apni ladaai ko kabir kii parampara se jod liya
 Actually this is the idea of india - the idea of india - which was best realized during the freedom struggle and on which the constitution was made
 yah samvidhan is myne main ek nayaa bharat bhi bana rahaa tha ki vah puraane daur kii kattartaaon, vishmataaon, anyaayon ko peeche chhod kar aage badhane kaa rasta suza rahaa tha
 After independence, Congress remained the representative of this India
 vah tarah-tarah ke maton, vichaaron, alag-alag bhashaaon or anchalon ko aapas main jodatii rahi
 When the Congress lost this power, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the one hand and the forces of social justice emerged on the other
 aaj ham paa rahe hai ki bharat kaa yah vichaar khatre main he
 The work of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its subsidiaries, the only India which has been pursuing the dream since 2014, is under implementation
 ek bahut aakraamak kism kaa bahusankhyakwaad samooche bharat par apni iklauti daavedaari jataa rahaa he or duusare samudaayon ko lekar tarah-tarah ke dar dikhaa rahaa he
 The Congress also has to fight this majoritarianism
 agar vah na lard sake to use hat janaa chahie or un takaton ko kaman saunp deni chahie jo yah ladaai lard sakate hai, isse judi vichaardhaara kii raajnneeti kar sakate hai
 The partnership of gandhi-lohia's socialism and Ambedkar's Dalitism in India could perhaps pave the way for that dream
 isamen andeh nahin ki apni raajnneetik pragatishiltaa ke baavjood congress apane saamaajik chaal-charitra main arase tak udaar bahusankhyakwaad kii hi numaaindgi karti rahi
 Due to this also the path of BJP became easier
 lekin isamen shaq nahin ki sonia-rahul kii congress apane charitra main indira-rajeev kii congress se bhinn he
 It is also progressive in many respects and also a believer in democratic inclusivity
 yahi vajah he ki sapa-basapa jaise asmitavaadi dalon yaa sipiem-sipiai jaise vam dalon se uskaa jhagada utana tikhaa nahin he
 On the contrary, both are seen moving almost simultaneously in many places
 kehane kii zarurat nahin ki congress ko bachanaa hoga to isi rup main bachanaa hoga or vikalp kii raajnneeti main zarurat padane par apane ko peeche bhi rakhana hoga
 The end of the Congress is the end of its longing for supremacy
 vaise congress ke ant kii ghoshnaa kar rahe logon ko itihaas dekhnaa chahie or samajhnaa chahie ki congress ek raajnneetik dal nahin, ek saamaajik pravriti he jisaki ore yah desh baar-baar lautne ko majaboor hota he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday held a press conference to surround the Modi government on the issue of Rafale plane deal
 rahul gandhi ne is dauraan goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikar ke saath hui mulaakaat par bhi safai di or kaha ki unhone us mulaakaat main rafel vimaan saude kii baat nahin kii thi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nirvachan ayog se saatvin clin chit mil gai he
 The opposition objected to the speech on 21 April in Patan, Gujarat
 jila nirvachan adhikari or rajya ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari kii report par ayog ko pradhanmantri modi ke is bhaashan main bhi koi khami nahin dikhi
 The opposition party Congress had so far filed 11 complaints of violation of code of conduct against PM Modi and Amit Shah
 ayog unhen ansuna karata rahaa to congress ne supreme court se guhaar lagaai ki huzur aap hi kuch karen
 The Commission does not listen
 iske baad court ne ayog ko jhaada ki aakhir ayog apni shaktiyon kaa istemaal kyon nahin kar rahaa? court ne somvaar tak modi-shah ke khilaaf darj aachaar samhita ulanghan kii sabhi shikayaton ko nipataane ko kaha
 After this, the Commission loosened its horoscope on complaints and Danadan decrees started coming
 sab main clin chit! pichhali saat shikayaton main sthaneey chunaav prashasan kii bheji report vipaksh kii shikayaton or bhaashanon kii video recording vaale sabooton ke baavjood ayog ko kisi main koi dam nazar nahin aayaa
 From the meeting hall of the Commission, news began to sizzle that everything was not going well
 haalat kuch kuch purv mukhya nirvachan ayukta gopalswami or naveen chawla ke daur ko doharaate lag rahe hai
 When differences and differences between the two deepened even further, Gopalaswami had to recommend to the government not to make Chawla a CEC, but the UPA government did not listen to him
 ab kaha to yahaan tak bhi ja rahaa he ki maujuuda teen main se ek ayukta ne piem modi or amit shah ko clin chit dene ko lekar shuru se kabhi haa main haa nahin milaai
 Despite their different stances, these orders have come by a majority of two
 clin chit kii ek insaide storinirvachan ayog se pradhanmantri modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko dhadadhad milane vaali clin chit ke peeche kii kahani dhire dhire saamne aa rahi he
 It is hotly discussed in the corridors of the Commission that clean chit is not completely clean
 isamen ek ayukta kii asahmati ke dhabbe hai
 The sources of the commission are taking the name of a commissioner
 lekin koi khul kar naam lene ko raji nahin he
 The same commissioner questioned the clean chit given to modi-shah by the commission so far
 aapatti uthaane vaale ayukta kaa kahana he ki jab jila nirvachan adhikari se lekar rajyon ke siio tak jaisi baat kah rahe hai or bheje gaye saboot bhi uski hi pushti kar rahe hai to clin chit kaa sawaal hi nahin hona chahie
 But it is decided by a majority of two commissioners
 aise main sawaal uthaane vaale ayukta ke tathy or daleel sandwich kii tarah bich main dab jate hai
 One official even said that clean chit orders have not come before the media even on the letterhead of the commission
 ab samvidhan ke jaankaar or raajnneetik vishleshak bhi ye bhi kehane lage hai ki paardarshita ko badhaane ke liye supreme court kii tarah hi nirvachan ayog main bhi sarvasammat yaa alag vichaar vaale masalon kaa khulaasa hona chahie

 abivipikisi ko daraati nahin he or na hi kisi ko darane kii zarurat he
 The ABVP is against them, who shout sedition slogans, who betray the country
 lekin gurmeher ko kisi ne bhadakaayaa he
 She is making false statements in this misguide
 tiwari ke mutabikgurmeharka jo video aayaa he, wo bade salike se profeshnal tareeke se banaaya gaya he
 This cannot be feared that there is someone behind this video
 haalanki unhone kaha ki ramajas kalege main jo hua, wo durbhagyapurna he, aisa nahin hona chahie tha
 Tiwari also feared that there may be people associated with Congress and Aam Aadmi Party behind this issue
 tiwari ke mutabik wo philhal to ye nahin kehete ki gurmeher se aisa koun karvaa rahaa he, lekin aam aadmi party ke log is tarah ke campan chalaane main maahir hai
 Shiv Sena, the bjp's oldest ally, has decided not to follow the political path ahead with it
 bijepi-shivasena dosti main tut gai he
 Shiv Sena has announced the dues of not contesting with the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 itnaa hi nahin 2019 main hi maharashtra main hone vaale vidhansabha shivasena akele chunaav ladegi
 Shiv Sena national president Uddhav Thackeray said that i promise that i will contest elections in all the states of the country on my own
 chaahe jeeten yaa haare, lekin chunaav apane dam par hi ladenge
 Shiv Sena has decided to contest separately from BJP today by passing a resolution in party executive meeting
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki prastaav paas kiya gaya he ki2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtraki sabhi loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladengi
 He said that if we will fight alone, we have claimed to win 25 Lok Sabha seats and 150 assembly seats
 jabaki maharashtra main kul 48 loksabhaa or 288 vidhansabha siten he
 While Shiv Sena currently has 63 mlas and 18 Lok Sabha members
 shivasena kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani kii baithak main uddhav thakare ne kaha ki paanch saal pehle log sochate the ki main party kaa netritv kaise karuunga
 i never had any problem in leading, because i had a strong and hardworking army, who are willing to sacrifice everything of the party
 unhone kaha ki aditya thakare ko aap logon ne ab netaa bana diya he
 The first meeting after the party was made reminds me that it was important to carry on the legacy
 uddhav thakare ne kaha ki mujhe koi parvaah nahin ki ise koi rajvansh raajnneeti kahata he
 There is a difference between dynasty and heritage
 uddhav ne kaha ki kaaryakaraani main paarit kiye gaye sabhi prastaav sirf aupchaarikta nahin hai
 He said that if Sardar Patel were alive today, then Pakistan would not exist
 2014 main centre kii satta par narendra modi ke virajman hone ke baad se hishivasena sakht tevakpanaae hue hai
 Despite being an ally in power, the Shiv Sena has attacked Modi's leadership government fiercely
 shivasena ne narendra modi par nijee hamale karne se lekar sarkaar kii nitiyon kii jamkar aalochana karti rahi he
 From Modi's demonetisation to GST, the Shiv Sena has strongly protested
 itnaa hi nahin modi dwaara teen talaak virdohi laae bill kii bhi shivasena ne mukhaalafat kiya he
 Not only this, on the question raised by SP and BSP about EVM, Sivasena stood apart from BJP
 bataa den ki shivasena bijepi kii sabase puraani sahyogi party rahi he
 When no one was willing to follow along with the BJP
 tabase shivasena bijepi ke saath he
 Now this friendship is seen to be cracking and the path of both is parting
 uttar pradesh kiakhilesh yadavasarkaar ne shuukravaar, 15 march ko apana ek saal puraa kar liya
 During the one-year rule, there were some achievements in the name of the government, and on many occasions faced failure
 akhilesh sarkaar ne berogari bhatta, kanya vidya dhan, kisaanon kii rin maafee,muft laptop vitaran jaise bade chunavi wadonko puraa kiya
 However, the unbridled hooliganism of the Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders and activists and the constantly deteriorating law and order have also put a question mark on the Akhilesh government
 samaajawaadee party dharmanirpekshata ke naare par uttar pradesh main satta main ai thi
 During his reign, there were 25 incidents of communal violence in the state in a year
 15 march 2012 ko badlaav ke vaahak ke taur par uttar pradesh kii kaman sanbhali
 The public had a lot of expectations from the academically educated young chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, but the spurt of SP workers and leaders who came to power with an absolute majority in the assembly elections was seen on the day of Akhilesh's swearing-in
 pehle din hi saaf ho gaya tha ki akhilesh ke saamne sabase badi chunauti gundaraj ko badhaava dene vaali party kii apni chhavi ko badalane kii hogi
 But, the events that have taken place during the last one year only say that Gundaraj's return in the state is more robust
 is gundaraj ne akhilesh ke bahupratikshit sushasan ke saare chunavi vaadon ko bhi dhata bataa diya
 In the last one year, Uttar Pradesh has witnessed more than two dozen incidents of communal violence
 in ghatnaon main kareeb 15 logon kii maut hui or kareeb sau log ghayal hue
 The markets remained closed and the common people suffered a great loss
 ummiido par khare nahin utre akhilesh: bhaajapabhartiya janata party ke pradesh pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak kehete hai ki vidhansabha chunaav ke samay bahubali deepi yadav or mukhtaar ansaari ko akhilesh ne samaajawaadee party main shaamil nahin karke acha kaam kiya tha
 The public felt that Akhilesh wanted to change the traditional 'gunda image' of the Samajwadi Party
 logon ne samajha ki unke mukhyamantri banane se pradesh main badlaav kii bayaar bahegi, lekin sari ummiden ek saal ke andar hi tut gayi
 Pathak said that Akhilesh has been a complete failure in curbing the law and order and the hooliganism of his party workers
 akhilesh ne madha media par doshaudhar, akhilesh sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon ke peeche vipakshi dalon kaa haath bataate hue kehete hai ki jo log in hinsa kii ghatnaon main girtaar kiye gaye hai
 Let them know which political party they belong to
 kanoon-vyavastha ko kharaab maanane se inkaar karte hue akhilesh ne buudhvaar ko media par hi dosha madh diya
 Akhilesh said that the issue of law and order has been exaggerated by the media
 akhilesh ne ek saal ke andar haalanki berajgari bhatta, kanya vidya dhan, mut sinchai, samaajawaadee swasthya seva ke tahat 108 ebulance seva, kisaanon kaa pachaas hajaar rupee tak kaa karj maaf karnaa, woomen power line seva, chaatr sangh behaal karnaa, lakhanu-agra express-ve nirmaan ko manjuuri, lakhanu main metro rail shuru karnaa kaa nirnay jaise kai saraahneey kaam bhi kiye
 Mulayam himself is not happy, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who gave hundred out of hundred to Akhilesh government on the occasion of the completion of the day, has also questioned the performance of the government and said that the feeling of the people in the functioning of the government Should be good, that is not happening
 pichley kuch maukon par saarvajanik rup se mantriyon, vidhayakon or netaaon ko aacharan par naaraazgi jataakar unhen tatkaal chetane or aacharan sudhaarney kii dhamkee de chuke hai, lekin iskaa asar hota najar nahin aayaa
 
 
 
 to sudhar sakate hai halaat: purv police mahanireekshakuttar pradesh ke purv police mahanireekshak es aar darapuri ke anusaar, netaaon kii gundagardee kii kai ghatnaon main akhilesh sarkaar ne apane netaaon par karwai ke bajaay ulte afasaron par hi gaaj gira di, jis kaaran unka manobal or bad gaya
 There is a need to give a strong message to the officers who encourage the officers and take strong action against them, only then will the situation improve
 saakh par batta lagabizli bachaane ke liye vanijyik pratishthanon ko shaam saat baje ke baad bijli aapurti band karne ke aadesh or vidhayakon ko vikaas fund se apane nijee istemaal ke liye bees lakh rupee tak kaa vaahan kharidne kii sweekruti jaise kuch faislon ko 12 ghante ke andar waapas lene se akhilesh yadav kii chhavi par batta laga
 Allegations of having a lot of power centers both at the political and bureaucratic level have indicated to the people that the Chief Minister does not have complete control over the government
 basapa ne akhilesh ko bataaya bebas, laachaar, kamjorbahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke varisht netaa evam uttar pradesh main netaa pratipaksh swami prasad maury kehete hai ki akhilesh yadav bebas, laachaar or kamjor mukhyamantri ke taur par najar aate hai
 It does not seem that there is anything called government in Uttar Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh sarkaar pichley bajet kaa aadha hissaa kharch nahin kar pai
 This shows a major failure of the government
 kaha ja saktaa he ki ye sarkaar har morche par vifal rahi he
 No work worth praise: Senior Congress Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi says that Chief Minister Akhilesh has not done any work in a year to praise him
 laptop or berogari bhatta jaise kuch 'lollypop' ko chhod diya jaae to vikaas ke liye rajya sarkaar kii taraf se koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 While the 'loved ones' patted the back, senior Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav dismissed the allegations of the opposition parties, saying that as Chief Minister, Akhilesh Yadav has accelerated the pace of development in Uttar Pradesh

 Significantly, after the Nirbhaya case of December 2012, when the laws were amended, the provision of capital punishment was included through an ordinance in case of death or death of a woman after rape, which was later criminal law
 The amendment became an act

 The flood situation in Assam became even more frightening today
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki is baadh se ab tak 17 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 An estimated 1 so far
 5 lakh log is baadh se prabhavit hue hai
 At the same time, the army has been carrying out a massive rescue and relief operation

 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje in dinon kudaal or fawda lekar mitti khod rahi hai or sir par mitti uthaa bhi rahi hai
 You must be wondering how Maharani has become a laborer
 darasal, vasundhara raaje jhalawad ke devari or baaraa ke tulsaan gaanv main apane abhiyaan ke tahat gaanv main pani jamaa karne ke liye talab or kuen khudva rahi hai
 Its specialty is that they are getting all this work done not with government money but with public money
 yani jis ilaake main pani ikattha karne ke liye talab khudenge us ilaake ke log apana paise lagaayenge
 The reason for this is that one government does not have this much fund and secondly, when they get their money done, they will also worry about it
 isamen mazdooree bhi janasahyog se hi ho rahaa he
 That is why Vasundhara Raje started it herself
 wo devari gaanv pahunchi or khud hi khudaai shuru kii
 For 17 minutes, Vasundhara Raje kept digging the soil in the pool and herself carried the soil
 unako paseene bahaate dekh daan daataaon yani kisaanon kii line lag gai
 If the industrialists working in the area become Bhamashah, then the general public and the leader-officers also opened their wallets
 dekhte hi dekhte talab khudwane ke liye 17 minute main hi 23 karod rupee ikattha ho gaye
 On this occasion, Vasundhara Raje said that i am going to collect the money and give it to the panchayat, but you have to take the responsibility of easing the water and maintaining it
 darasal rajasthan kshetrafal kii drushti se desh kaa sabase bada rajya he magar pani yahaan desh kaa maatr ek fisadi hi he
 That is why Vasundhara Raje has campaigned for self-reliance across the state

 The results of the latest study are very similar to the study conducted between 1999 and 2004 by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
 adhyayan se yah sabit hota he ki absai asamay mrityu ke khatre se aagaah karne vaala vaid sanketak he
 The study found that the increase in ABSI correlates with the risk of untimely death and recent ABSI is a more reliable indicator

" '' According to Junaid's mother, Shayra, after the body of Junaid arrived in the house, it was found that her son had been killed
 syra junayd ko yaad karte hue kahati hai ki ''junayd aksar kaha karata tha ki vah ek din dilli kii jama maszid kaa imam banegaa
 But my son was beaten to death
 kya galati thi us maasoom kii?'' Junaid was killed by a mob beaten and stabbed at Asavati near Ballabhgarh

 The party of Dalma, which has been in power since 2003, became a stronghold of political resistance, formed in 1980 during the military dictatorship
 is party ne brazil ko phir se loktantric banane main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 Luis Inacio as Lula da Silva first arrived at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2003, a laborer (wakers Party), and eight years later, in 2011, Dilma Rousseff became the first female president of the country, and from here the new sun rose in the corridors of power
 mantriyon par kadi karrwidilma ko apane pehle kaarykaal main kai pareshaaniyon se do-chaar hona padaa
 Many times it seemed that he would not be able to return to power again, but he took strict steps to control the damage

 is badlaav ko aitihaasik kaha ja rahaa he
 Through the amendment, 60 lakh people working as servants, midwives, bai or watchmen have been brought under the purview of the labor law
 america ko bhi dikhaae tevardilma ne 2013 main america kaa daura radd kar diya tha
 At that time it was revealed that the US had spied him, after which Dilma asked the US to apologize, which the US refused
 unhone ek radio intervyuu main kaha tha, 'main yatra par ja rahi thi
 We said that there is only one solution
 america ko is ghatana par maafee maangani chahie or dobaaraa aisa na hone kaa vaada karnaa chahie
 'in the midst of such protests in 2013, Dalma Rousseff passed legislation to improve education and health services
 iske jariye unhone khanij tel se hone vaali aamadani kaa 75 pratishat hissaa shiksha or 25 pratishat swasthya sevaaon par kharch kiye jane kii vyavastha karai
 To control the immediate situation, his government had also ordered 14,000 doctors from Cuba, Spain, Portugal and Argentina

 He lives in the streets of Azamgarh city, his family is very large, all together
 ilaake main uski saakh he, lekin uskaa rasookh uske rahan-sahan main nadaarad he
 Yes, his style suggests that he is indeed your MLA, the name is Alam Badi
 umr 82 saal, 20 rupaye meter ke tande ke kapade kaa kurta pyjama, maamuli chappal, kaan main choti si sunne kii mashin, haath main mahaj 1200 rupaye kaa mobile, charhara badan lekin chehre par gazab kaa aatmavishvaas or sukun
 These are Alam Badi, a three-time MLA from Nizamabad in Azamgarh in the 20th century
 ghar main jhaadu lagaate mileshhar kii galiyon main ghuskar jab 'ajtak' kii team alam badi sahab ke ghar pahunchi, to achraj hua ki, ye teen baar ke vidhayak or phir se samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar alam badi kaa ghar he
 Badi Saheb got up early in the morning cleaning his room and came to meet us, refused to take the visuals of sweeping the room, saying that this is my personal business, everyone does it in their house, what to show it
 chunavi mausam main unke ghar par party kaa koi jhanda yaa bhompu nahin he
 Yes, the flag of India is sure
 chahal-pahal bhi chunavi nahin dikhti, saadagi kaa pulinda hi nazar aata he
 Usually, the person coming to Badi Saheb's house gets tea without milk in a small cup
 ghar main mehmaan ke liye naashtaa banane or parosane ke liye koi naukar bhi nahin he
 His son and grandson only do this work
 sardi ho yaa garmi ghar ke tin shed ke neeche wo logon se rubaru hote hai
 Even after painting the house, the time must have passed
 upi roadways main safarbadi sahab ke paas thik-thaak gaadi tak nahin he
 At first there was a second-hand ambassador, then it was known throughout the area, because sometimes it used to stand on the road in the middle, sometimes the oil was exhausted, sometimes it was spoiled
 ab bamushkil ek second hand bulero lee he, lekin uskaa kam hi istemaal karte hai
 Finally comes the issue of adding oil
 aise main badi sahab kabhi kisi kaaryakarta kii gaadi main baith jate hai yaa phir sadak par jo mila usase hi lift le lete hai
 During the assembly session, he uses his pass in UP Roadways bus to go to Lucknow
 badi sahab maikenical ejeeniyar hai, shuruyaat main gorakhpur main naukari bhi kii, lekin nehru, bose, gandhi se prerana lekar samajaseva main aa gaye
 In 1996, he contested the Samajwadi Party for the first time and won
 tab se ab tak 3 baar chunaav jeet chuke hai, 5veen baar lard rahe hai
 He was defeated only once by a small number of votes
 do lakh main ladaa chunaavalam badi ke chunaav prachaar kii khaas baat ye he ki wo subah 9 baje se shaam 5 baje tak hi prachaar karte hai
 They say that when they serve 5 to 9 people for 5 years, then why change the time during elections
 dilachasp he ki, jis ek baar badi sahab chunaav haare, to agali subah bhi 9 baje ilaake main logon ke bich pahunch gayi
 By the way, you will be surprised to know that Badi Saheb had contested the 2012 election for a mere Rs 2 lakh
 is baar wo kehete hai ki,ab tak 2 lakh hi chunaav main kharch aayaa he, kuch din or hai to shaayad kuch hazaar or kharch ho jaaenge
 Many times his family is unhappy with this attitude of Badi Saheb
 aapasi baatcheet main unka dard chhalak jaataa he
 Badi Sahab has 6 sons, out of which 3 are out for small jobs, while the eldest son works for a private job of just Rs 15,000
 duusare bete kii furniture kii choti si dukaan he, jisase bas guzar basar hi ho paata he
 Nowadays, during the election season, he closes the shop and is busy campaigning with his father
 chote bete pie ke taur par alam badi ke saath rahete hai, lekin majaal he ki, koi bhi aadesh yaa kaam wo bina badi sahab ke kar len
 Their job is only to obey the orders of Badi Saheb, they just shake the phone, they talk themselves
 alam badi kehete hai 'naa main kamishan khaataa hum or naa hi mere bete thekedaar se milakar khel karte hai'
 It is famous in the area that Badi Sahab's MLA fund's tender is not taken by any contractor quickly, because they do the road, drain or any work on their own
 kamishan lete nahin or kami hone par thekedaar ko blaclist karaane se bhi chookte nahin hai
 In the name of martyrs, there are tales of working for all religions and castes, along with their honesty about the monument
 haal hi main badi sahab ne is ilaake ke shaheedon ke naam par 4 bade dwaar banawaaye hai, jisamen koi bhi muslim nahin he
 While showing the door, Badi Saheb tells with great earnestness that, this will inspire the next generation
 badi sahab ko mulaayam singh yadav or phir akhilesh yadav ne mantri banane ko kaha to badi ne inkaar kar diya
 He says that till today i have not gone to ask for tickets or marks, Netaji and Akhilesh send themselves
 unhone mantri banane ko kaha to maine kisi noujvaan ko banane kaa suzav diya
 Badi says that if he had become a minister, he would have been away from his area
 mulaayam ko diya kathor sujhavvaise badi sahab mulaayam singh ko aisa suzav de chuke hai, jisase khud mulaayam bhi hakke bakke rah gaye
 Badi says that Mulayam Singh asked him to tell me some work that people remember me
 jis par badi ne mulaayam ko sujhaayaa ki aap chunaav jeetne ke baad sunishchit kariye ki aapke vidhayak or mantri chunaav jeetne ke pehle jis ghar main rahete the, usee main jeetne ke baad bhi rahenge
 Bungalow and Kothi will not be taken, do not even install a red light, then the public will never forget you
 badi bataate hai ki meraa suzav sunakar mulaayam ne kaha ki, main to kar duun, lekin aajkal to sabhi isi ke liye vidhayak banate hai, wo kaise maanenge
 Well, Akhilesh openly says that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but his values are such that he will go forward
 mere jane par wo kursi se khadey ho jate hai
 Finally, we accepted Badi Saheb, then asked how can you remain so fit at this age
 unhone tapaak se jawaab diya 'main veg, non veg donon kha letaa hoon, lekin din bhar main 2 roti, 2 andey or 2 gilaas doodh kii khuraaq he
 Eat less, walk and drink plenty of water, i walk on it

 india today state of state conklev ke karnataka chapter ke duusare satr kaa theme agriculture and deveopment first tha
 Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Gowda, Agriculture Secretary Ashok Dalwai and Organic Farming Madhu Chandan participated in this session
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today ke research editor ajit jha ne kiya
 The session started with the issue of what steps are being taken to double farmers' income by 2022
 rajya ke krishi mantri kaa maananaa tha ki aaj agriculture kii sthiti badal chuki he
 Farmers need more value for their crops, not more fertile seeds
 vahiin ashok dalwai ne kaha ki kisaanon kii aay badhaane ke liye - production kii jagah inakam ko tarjeeh dene kii jarurat he
 There is a need to mobilize cheap cultivation resources
 yah kaam technology kii madad se kiya ja saktaa he
 Its people will once again move from urban areas to rural areas
 rajya main krishi production ko badhaane ke baad ab rajya main yah koshish kii jaani chahie ki kaise is paidaavaar ko kam se kam kshetra main kar liya jaae
 The advantage will be that the farmer will get an opportunity to plant other cash crops in the remaining fields, which can easily increase his annual income
 ashol dalwai ke mutabik production matrix yaa crop jeeyometry se ham kisaanon kii aamadani ko badha sakate hai
 Along with this, agriculture will also help in making the backbone of the industry
 cash crop ke liye sambhaavna banane ke baad kisaanon ko un fasalon par tarjeeh dene kii jarurat rahegi jisaki industry main sidhi maang rahati he
 The biggest advantage of this will be that once again the biggest means of employment in the country can be produced in the agricultural sector
 ise bhi padhein: berthde special: manmohan kii wo 'warning', jo dhire-dhire sach sabit huinsatr kaa sanchaalan kar rahe ajit jha ne sawaal kiya ki kya 100 fisadi irigation ke jariye bhi kisaanon kii aamadani ko doguna kiya ja saktaa he? iske jawaab main madhu chandan kaa kahana he ki ham is hakeekat ko nakaar nahin sakate ki bharat main pani kii kami he
 And in the coming days the water shortage will become more narrow
 aankadon ke mutabik desh main 80 fisadi kul jal sansaadhan kaa upyog kheti main kiya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the countries are completely dependent on rain
 lihaaja desh ke aise rain fed aria main hamen un fasalon main nivesh karne kii jarurat he jise kam se kam pani main taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 For this it is also necessary that we learn a lesson from Israel
 israel ne irigation ke nae sansadhano ke saath-saath arendi ke jariye adhik paidaavaar karne vaale bijon par dhyaan diya
 Due to this, despite the shortage of Israeli water and the lack of land for agricultural use, production from farms has increased
 ant main ajit jha ne kaha ki jab california ne silicon city ke sahare apane 40 fisadi registan ko desh kaa bread basket bana liya to bharat kyon aisa karne main vifal rahaa he
 Or why the work done by Sriganganagar in Rajasthan could not be done in North Karnataka or other states of the country
 is satr ke ant main isi baat par jor diya gaya ki bina kisaanon kii khushhaali ko sunishchit kiye sirf silicon vaili ke sahare koi rajya agrani kii bhoomika main zyada din nahin rah saktaa
 The ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Center has withdrawn permission to the Adani Group, considered close to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, to create a special economic zone (special Economic Zone or SEZ) on 1,840 hectares of land in the state
 centre ke is kadam ko narendra modi sarkaar ke liye jatke ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 According to sources, this permission has been withdrawn on this basis, as the 1,840 hectare land is not adjacent to the rest of the land marked for SEZ
 darasal, rajya main puraa esaized project 10,000 hectare kaa he, jisamen se 6,500 hectare zamin ko pehle hi esaized states diya ja chukaa he
 The 1,840 hectares of land that has become an issue in this case is part of the remaining 3,500 hectares
 tippaniyan Sources have informed that the company (adani Group) was expecting progress in the matter, and they have also sent a fresh application for grant of SEZ status to this 1,840 hectare piece of land
 anumati waapas liye jane ke aadesh par vaanijya mantri anand sharma ne kal (somvaar) dastakhat kiye
 After the news came, 11:15 am Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone shares 1 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)
 63 pratishat ke giravat se 121
 It was trading at Rs 121 on 05 and down by two per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE)
 sutron ke mutabik, yah anumati is aadhaar par waapas lee gai he, kyonki yah 1,840 hectare zamin esaized ke liye chihnit kii gai baaki zamin se satee hui nahin he
 In fact, the entire SEZ project in the state is of 10,000 hectares, of which 6,500 hectares of land has already been given SEZ status
 jo 1,840 hectare zamin is maamle main mudda bani he, vah baaki 3,500 hectare kaa hissaa he
 The comments sutron ne jaankaree di he ki company (adani samooh) is maamle main pragati kii ummid kar rahi thi, or unhone zamin ke is 1,840 hectare ke tukade ko esaized states die jane ke liye dobaaraa arji bhi bhej di he
 Commerce Minister Anand Sharma signed yesterday (monday) on the order to withdraw the permission

 From the attitude of the UPA government at the Center, it seems that she is rethinking her idea of bringing an ordinance on many other issues along with combating corruption
 jin adhyadeshon ko laane kii yojana thi, unamem se kai aise bhi hai jinhen lekar congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi khaas dilchaspee le rahe hai
 The issue of ordinances was to be discussed in the cabinet meeting on Friday, but it was later deferred
 samajha jaataa he ki sarkaar ne yah faisla tab taala jab kendriya mantri or rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke pramukh sharad pavaar ne sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke ant main jaldbaaji main adhyadeshon ko laane ke auchity par sawaal uthaae
 According to sources, Sharad Pawar said that there is no need to hurry to enact an anti-corruption law and the decision should be left to the future government
 sarkaar ko yah andeshaa bhi he ki inhen aadhaaron par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee bhi sawaal uthaa sakate hai
 It was agreed to postpone the decision to bring the ordinance in a cabinet meeting that lasted nearly two hours
 bhrashtachar se mukaable ke liye bhrashtachar nirodhak (sanshodhan) vidheyak or citijan charter vidheyak par adhyadesh laana tha
 Rahul Gandhi himself is very serious about these Bills
 inke alaava, essi-asti (utpeedan rokthaam) sanshodhan vidheyak, ni:shakt vyaktiyon kaa adhikaar vidheyak, suraksha kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak or dilli ucch nyaayalay kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak par bhi adhyadesh laane kii yojana thi
 Sources said that as soon as the cabinet meeting commenced, Cabinet Secretary Ajit Kumar Seth announced that the subjects related to the ordinances are 'avoided'
 sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main hangaamon kii vajah se uparokt vidheyak paarit nahin ho paae the
 It is understood that the issue of ordinances was also discussed in the party's core group meeting chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 is baithak main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi shirkat kii
 Sources said that the government has not given up hope completely and the Prime Minister will try to know the mood of the President on this issue
 somvaar ko myanmar ravaanaa hone se pehle pradhanmantri raashtrapati se mulaakaat karenge
 Sources said that some sections in the government are of the opinion that bringing the ordinance just before the elections can bring technical, legal and constitutional issues

 bengal kii khadi main chakravaati tufaan banane kii ashanka gaharaa chuki he
 According to the Meteorological Department, a low pressure area has formed in the Andaman Sea at this time which will pick up more speed in the next 24 hours
 is wedar system ko jab joardaar takat mil jaaegi to ye 8 oktober ko ek chakravaati tufaan main tabdeel ho jayega
 The weather system will then be called Hudhud Cyclone
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik 7 or 8 oktober ko andaman or nicobar ke tamaam ilaakon main baari se bahut baari barish hogi, lihaaja in ilaakon ke liye varning jari kar di gai he
 Due to the cyclonic storm, high waves are likely to rise in the Andaman Sea, so fishermen are being advised not to venture into the sea
 is samay bengal kii khadi main samandar main jitani energy he usko dekhte hue yahi anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki andaman nicobar ko peeche chhodte hi ye chakravaati tufaan hudahud or zyada taqatvar ho jayega
 It is estimated that the cyclonic storm in the Bay of Bengal will last for three to four days, so its strength may reach the equivalent of Cyclone Pillin in October last year
 isliye desh bhar main tamaam sarkari agenciyon ko satark kar diya gaya he
 Weather experts say that Cyclone is not yet formed
 jab 8 taarikh ko cyclone ban jayega to iske raste ke bare main or ye kahaan par hit karegaa iske bare main sahi-sahi aankalan mil paaegaa
 But according to preliminary estimates, Cyclone Hudhud will hit the coastal areas of northern Andhra Pradesh and Orissa around the 12th
