 Whatever they do, they always do it with heart
 lakhanu main 'jolly elelbi 2' kii shooting kar rahe hai akshay kumaungar yun kaha jaae ki akshay har kirdaar ko jite hai to galat nahin hoga
 Perhaps this is the reason that when 'jolly' was in Delhi recently to promote the film, he gave advice to the people
 akshay ne kaha, 'hamaare desh main pehle hi jajes kam hai tabhi cese 14 se 15 saal tak latake rahete hai
 People should also not do Khamkhan case

 Of the 5 crore cases, 35% are of traffic only
 agar trephic se jude keson ko deal karne ke liye alag judiciri bana di jaae to kam se kam 35 percent cese kam darj honge
 The most important thing is that if everyone follows the traffic rules then the problem will automatically be solved to a large extent

 The leaders built flyovers a lot and the contractors got themselves built in the name of nation building
 apwaad chhod den to zyaadaatar fliover shahar ko jam se mukt karaane main naakaam rahe hai
 Today, even after more than 90 flyovers have been built in Delhi, the condition of the jam remains the same

 The condition is that the statement of Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has been printed that he has prepared a road map of 50,000 crore to rid Delhi of jams

 China also has a huge network of bullet trains
 lekin kaha jaataa he ki china main aam log saadhaaran train main hi chalanaa pasand karte hai yaa bullate train main chalanaa sabake bas kii baat nahin he
 The bullet train has sucked China's economy a lot
 europe ke kai amir deshon main bullate train kaa idia chhod diya he
 Germany too thought but left
 america main bhi ise lekar kaaphi charchaa hui he
 Why are India when people whose per capita income is more than India are not enthusiastic about bullet train
 france ne 2008 main argetina ko bullate train ke liye lone diya tha
 But there started protesting that there was no benefit from it
 argentina ab china kii madad se apane network ko behatar kar rahaa he or bullate train kaa idia chhod chukaa he
 Due to this, the network of the entire country is benefiting and the expenses are also being reduced
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki japan main bullate train kaa network safal he
 Due to this, people come from far and wide in Tokyo city
 companiyaan bullate train ke kiraaye kaa kharchaa bhi detii hai
 Japan's experience is going to be fifty years old

 shahar ke bich ke transport or do shaharon ke bich ke transport kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 The bullet train is a long distance between two cities
 china main bhi bullate train kaa vishaal network he
 But it is said that common people in China prefer to walk in an ordinary train or walk in a bullet train
 bullate train ne china kii arthvyavastha ko khub chusaa he
 Many rich countries in Europe have abandoned the idea of bullet train
 germany ne bhi sochaa magar chhod diya
 There is a lot of discussion about this in America as well
 jab ve log jinaki prati vyakti aay bharat se adhik he bullate train ko lekar utsahit nahin hai, bharat kyon hai
 France had loaned Argentina in 2008 for a bullet train
 lekin vahaan virodh hone laga ki isse koi laabh nahin
 Argentina is now improving its network with the help of China and has given up the idea of bullet train
 isse puure desh ke network ko laabh mil rahaa he or kharchaa bhi kam ho rahaa he
 But it is also true that the bullet train network is successful in Japan
 iske kaaran tokyo shahar main dur dur se log aate hai
 Companies also pay for the fare of the bullet train
 japan kaa anubhav pachaas saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 If there are examples of failure then the success of Japan can also be learned

 postmortem report ke mutabik rohit kii maut 15-16 april kii raat ek se dedh baje ke darmyaan hui? agar rohit kii maut do baje se pehle ho chuki thi to phir 16 april kii raat do se 4 baje ke bich rohit ke mobile se phone karne kii koshish kisne kii? kyonki kol detail ke mutabik rohit ke mobile se kol karne kii koshish kii gai thi, haalanki kol lagi nahin
 Killer inside the house! Rohit went into his bedroom at around one o'clock in the night
 magar iske baad bhi agle din chaar baje tak nahin uthaa
 That is, he slept for more than 24 hours and no one at home felt this strange? Why so? These are the things that have convinced the crime branch of the Delhi Police investigating the case that Rohit Shekhar Tiwari's killer is not outside the house but inside the house, but the question is who is under suspicion? On the highest rung of wife and brother, Shaka currently has none other than Rohit Shekhar's own wife Apurva
 vahi apurva he jisaki shaadi saal bhar pehle hi rohit se hui or jo peshey se vakil he
 And this is the same Apurva, who was the last person to go to Rohit's room that night
 shaq ke ghere main duusare number par he rohit kaa bhai siddharth
 Siddhartha because the police feel that he can remove his brother-in-law with crores of property
 maut kii sajeesh saaf nahinchunki abhi tak cese sulajhaa nahin he or kaatil pukhta taur par saamne bhi nahin aayaa
 So no one is outside the circle of doubt
 yahaan tak ki rohit kii maa ujjwala bhi
 However, it has been proved that Ujjwala was not there during Rohit's murder
 wo kuch ghante pehle hi us ghar se nikal kar tilak len ke apane duusare ghar main ja chuki thim
 But whether or not the intrigue wires go to them, they are not clear yet
 chaar naukaron se bhi poochtachaghar main us raat driver samet chaar naukar bhi the
 Now since no one came inside the house from outside, the role of these four is also not beyond doubt
 sidhe nahin to katl main inaki madad kii bhoomika se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, the servants have not yet received a clean chit
 sabhi se lagaataar poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 But the death knots are yet to be resolved
 bijepi saansad gopal shetty ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ko jindagi khatm karne kaa fishan or chalan qaraar diya he
 This comment has come at a time when 124 farmers have committed suicide since January this year in Maharashtra, which is facing agrarian crisis
 buudhvaar ko borivali main yojit ek samaaroh main uttar mumbai kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale saansad shetty ne kaha, sab kisaanon kiaatmahatya, berogari or bhukhmareeke kaaran nahin hoti
 a bit of a fashion is afoot
 yah ek chalan ho gaya he
 Shetty said, if the Maharashtra government is paying Rs 5 lakh as compensation, then another government in the neighboring state is giving Rs 7 lakh
 saansad bane shetty ne kaha, kisaanon ko muaavje main dhan dene ke liye in logon ke bich hode lagi hui he
 Condemning the mp's remarks, the Congress said that Shetty's insensitive remarks reflected bjp's insensitivity towards farmers
 kisaanon ke prati asamvedansheel he bijepimarsisi ke adhyaksh sanjay nirupam ne kaha he ki aise samay main, jab maharashtra ab tak ke sabase bure krishi sankat se guzar rahe hai, aise main shetty kii tippanee dikhaati he ki vah or unka dal un hajaaron kisaanon ke prati kitne asamvedansheel hai

 gyaat ho ki rajya sarkaar ne do din pehle hi bombai ucch nyaayalay ko bataaya tha ki is saal janvari se ab tak 124 kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 Center was asked for cooperation
 The High Court had asked the Center what kind of help the government is providing to deal with this dreadful agrarian crisis? Assuming this to be a serious issue, a bench headed by Judge Naresh Patil had asked the Additional Solicitor General to tell the High Court whether the Center can contribute in providing schemes and economic help to the state to overcome the crisis? Suicides in India: Advocate Shrihari Ani told the bench that 124 farmers have committed suicide in the last one and a half months, out of which 20 cases have come from Osmanabad alone
 unhone kaha ki kam barish ke kaaran fasal barbaad hone, pine ke liye or fasalon ke liye pani kii kam aapurti, karj chukaane main asamarthta or bainkon evam sahukaaron kii ore se daale jane vaale dabaav ne in kisaanon ko aatmahatya ke liye vivash kiya

 dhani log hameshaa vyavastha ke bare main chintaa prakat karte rahete hai lekin ve bamushkil hi vot daalate hai
 i congratulate Modi for bringing a law that made voting compulsory
 ’ anivaary matdaan kanoon ab tak lagu nahin kiya gaya kyonki rajyapal ne us par ab tak dastakhat nahin kiye hai
 Advani said, 'I have very little time for campaigning as voting is coming closer
 lekin main yahaan aayaa hum kyonki meraa ghar adipur main he
 (country in 1947) We came here after partition
 is tarah, main hameshaa bhaavnaatmak rup se kuccha se judaa rahaa
 He said, 'I participated in every election since 1952
 jab bharat aaazaad hua, ham sabhi ne aashaa kii thi ki hamaara raashtra 2000 ke baad swarna kaal main kadam rakhega
 but that did not happen
 tab hamane aashaa kii ki 21veen sadi main chijen badalengi lekin kuch nahin badla
 'advani said,' Now i feel that our dream will come true in the next five years because we are very close to form the next government
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab ham bharat aae the tab meri daadi pehle se hi 80 saal kii thim or vah kaashi janaa chaahati thim jahaan unhone apni jindagi ke shesh din bitaye or antat: vahiin unhone praan tyaag die

 All the people of India were shocked on the morning of 21 November by the news that Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving terrorist of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has been hanged
 sarkaar ne zyada taam-jham na karte hue oparation eks ko anjaam diya
 Under this, 7 in the morning with complete secrecy
 30 baje kasaab ko faansee di gai
 The government showed unusual and unprecedented persistence in executing the death penalty of Kasab, a Pakistani national, when Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, while talking to the media shortly after, gave details of the incident, his enthusiasm was worth seeing
 unhone kaha, ‘‘raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kasaab kii dayaa yachika 5 november ko radd kii thi
 Then i went to Rome (for an Interpol conference)
 7 november ko waapas lautate hi maine turant is par dastakhat kiye
 The next day i sent it to the Government of Maharashtra
 ” scindia ne yah bhi kaha ki aatankwaad par ek sakht sandesh diya janaa jaruri tha
 Mukherjee also made it clear that he would not be a mere president
 agar ve chaahate to kasaab kii file par koi faisla kiye bina chupchaap baithe rahete, jaisaa ki unase pehle pratibha patil ne apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal main do darjan maamalon main kiya
 Kasab's mercy petition was rejected by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 23 October
 mukherjee ne apana faisla do hafton se bhi kam samay main kar liya
 It is also a reflection of the fact that the government is tightening its stand amidst the thrust of the possibilities of being ahead of the Lok Sabha elections
 is faansee ne pakistan ko stabdh kar diya or bijepi bhi sochati rah gai ki kya pratikriya de
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid claimed that the Pakistan government had been informed about this before Kasab's hanging and a message was sent to Kasab's family through diplomatic channels
 khurshid ne ek tivi channel se kaha, ‘‘mujhe ummid he ki isse duniya bhar main yah sandesh jayega ki bharat main kanoon kaa sammaan hota he
 Of course whether the person is an Indian citizen or not
 hamane apni jimmedaari nibhaai he
 Now it is expected that Pakistan will also be supporting the law
 ”bharat ko yah ahsaas tha ki pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik kii agavaani karne kaa yah sahi mauka nahin hoga, lihaaja usne 20 november ko unase anurodh kiya ki ve 22-23 november ko hone vaali apni bharat yatra ko taal den
 These dates were proposed by the Pakistani side to implement the recently liberalized india-pakistan visa agreement
 yah nayaa samjhauta 38 saal puraane vija samjhaute kii jagah legaa, jisase samaybaddh dhang se vija kii manjuuri milane kaa rasta saaf hoga
 This will give more opportunities for people of both the countries to mingle and trade
 ab yah yatra jald hoti najar nahin aati kyonki bharat ne nai tarikhon ke bare main koi suzav nahin diya he
 Although the Government of India cited the reason for not receiving Malik for the Parliament session starting on November 22, Shinde did not want to be seen abusing him just before the 26 / 11 anniversary
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is aatanki hamale main shaamil logon ko sajaa dilaane main pakistan sarkaar kii naakaami isaki mukhya vajah thi
 Only those who needed to know about this operation were aware of it
 khurshid ko is bare main pataa tha kyonki isamen kutanyik pahalu shaamil the
 The speed and secrecy of this operation remained well known
 scindia ne is bare main kaha, ‘‘sarkaar nahin chaahati thi ki faansee se pehle koi anchaahi baat ho jaae
 "but the Home Minister must have gone wrong on one thing
 jab media ne unase poocha ki kya pradhanmantri kasaab ko 21 november ko faansee dene ke bare main jaanate the, to scindia ne kaha, ‘‘nahin, nahin
 Only the Ministry of Home Affairs and the President were aware of this
 ” is baat ko baad main maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan ne kaata, jinhone tivi channelon ko bataaya ki pradhanmantri is faisle se avgat the
 Barring this one mistake, the entire process from Kasab's mercy petition to the President on September 18 to his execution was completed in just two months
 jabaki 2001 main sansad par hamale ke doshi tehraae gaye afjal guru kii dayaa yachika aktubar, 2006 se lambit he
 BJP raised the issue of Afzal Guru and wanted to remove the air of Congress balloon
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne faansee ke turant baad twit kiya, ‘‘afjal guru ko lekar kya kiya, jisane 2001 main hamaare loktantr ke mandir, sansad par hamalaa kiya tha? uskaa aparaadh kasaab ke ghrunit krity se kai saal pehle kaa he
 In fact Kasab was decided by bypassing the long list of criminals standing in the death row
 jo 15 dayaa yachikaayen lambit thim, unamem kasaab kaa number aakhri main he
 Afzal was at number six on this list
 june 2009 main tatkaaleen kanoon mantri em
 Veerappa Moily had said, "you cannot pick someone up and hang him
" ” unhone kaha tha ki is kram ko todaa nahin ja saktaa
 Obviously, this is no longer the case
 manmohan sarkaar is chhavi se bachanaa chaahati thi ki vah aatankwaad ko lekar naram he, amal karne main kamjor he yaa nirnaayak kadam uthaane main aksham he
 Congress leaders may have avoided chest-thumping or taking credit for this execution, but they did at least snatch an issue from BJP
 lekin unhone is baat ko jarur mana ki ab afjal kaa masalaa waapas rajnatik centre bindu ban jayega
 Sources said that Mukherjee is also in favor of immediate disposal of the remaining pending cases
 grih mantralay ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘unhone baaki 14 filon ko bhi grih mantralay ke paas waapas spashtikaran ke liye bheja he
 These cases were stuck with his predecessor Pratibha Patil for a long time
 ve chaahate hai ki grih mantralay in par nae sire se vichaar kare
 However, the rest of the matters will not be so easy for the Congress
 ek varisht vakil ne kaha ki kasaab ke videshi hone ke kaaran upie is bare main bad-chadh kar bolne kii sthiti main he kyonki is kaaran vah mrityudand kii qatari main khadey anya logon se alag tha
 He said, "it will not be so easy in the case of Afzal
 vah vot bank par asar daal saktaa he
 "but the pressure on the Congress to hang the Guru has definitely increased
 use rajnatik jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhkar ek santulit kadam uthaanaa hoga
 These senior lawyers said, "if they do not hang Afzal, it would be like accepting that Kasab was an easy target
 agar ve use faansee dete hai, to congress ko iske rajnatik nateezon or ek mahatvapurn vot bank kho dene ke jokhim ke bare main saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 "the decision to hang Kasab on 21 November was taken on 8 November in the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), in which Manmohan Singh, Shinde, Finance Minister P
K
 chidambaram or rahna mantri e
 K
 antni shaamil the
 According to sources, CCS had considered hanging Kasab on 26 November, which was the anniversary of the terror attack
 lekin sisies kaa faisla iske khilaaf rahaa kyonki isse lagata ki bharat kuch sabit karnaa chahta he
 Government sources said, "it was decided to dispose of it immediately and without any hitch
" ”maharashtra main sirf do jelon main faansee dene kaa bandobast he—nagpur central jail or pune kii yeravada jail
 Yerwada was chosen because it is close to Mumbai, where Kasab was lodged in Arthur Road Jail
 kasaab ko ek jail adhikari ne faansee dene ke bare main 12 november ko bataaya tha
 According to sources, Kasab burst out on hearing this and started saying, "allah swear, i will not make such a mistake again
" allaah mujhe maaf kare
 "this officer told," He asked us to tell his mother about her hanging in Pakistan
 ” kasaab kii maa nuri lai ne april, 2009 main hi bharat aakar usase milane kii ichha jataai thi
 But talk of his arrival got entangled in diplomatic processes
 arthur road jail ke adhikariyon ne 5 november ko yah khabar failaa di ki kasaab ko bukhaar ho gaya he
 There was speculation that he had dengue
 bataaya jaataa he ki uski puri medical jaanch hui or khun kaa pareekshan hua, jisamen spasht hua ki use dengue yaa koi or sankraman nahin hua he
 It is now clear that the jail authorities have tested whether or not he is medically fit to be hanged on the pretext of dengue
 bharat main yah anivaary he ki faansee dene se pehle us vyakti ke swasth hone kii jaanch ho
 He was medically examined at the last minute, an hour before the hanging
 kasaab ko ek vishesh vimaan se 19 november ko tadake mumbai se pune le jaaya gaya tha
 The entire operation was supervised by 10 senior officers of the state police, including DGP Sanjeev Dayal, IGP Deven Bharti and Joint Commissioner Himanshu Rai
 jab ve arthur road jail main kasaab kii kothri main pahunche to vah daraa hua dikh rahaa tha
 "for the first time in four years, we saw fear on his face," said an official
 ” jail adhikariyon ne kasaab ko uski faansee ke bare main grih mantralay kaa aadesh padhakar sunaaya
 The order was signed before Yerwada prison authorities were handed over
 yeravada jail adhikariyon ne 21 november kii subah faansee dene se thik pehle kasaab ko ‘pareshaan’ dekha
 He prayed for a minute and asked the authorities if his family had been informed of his execution
 usne koi vasiyat nahin likhi, na hi koi aakhri ichha bataai
 According to sources, Kasab did not show much emotion in his last nine days after receiving the news of the hanging
 ek sutara ne bataaya, ‘‘vah apni special cell main hi rahaa or pehle kii tarah hi kisi se baat nahin karata tha
 Kasab spent his last minutes in prayer
 usne koi khaas antim ichha nahin bataai, na hi vah apane ghar main kisi se baat karnaa chahta tha
 When he was told that there was no further scope of appeal, he proceeded to the 'calm and bewildered' gallows
 mumbai par 26 / 11 ke hamale main iklaute jinda pakade gaye is aatankwaadi ko faansee ke baad usee parisar main dafna diya gaya kyonki kisi ne uski laash lene ke liye daawa nahin kiya
 ACP Dilip Mane said, "it was the right end of the man who killed so many innocent people
" maane ne jab panwel sthit apane ghar main is faansee ke bare main suna to ve apni kursi se uchhal pade
 As senior inspector of the Government Railway Police, at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, on the night of November 26, 2008, Mane saw corpses scattered among the crowd
 ve kehete hai ki ghayal yatriyon ke chehron or unki chikhon ne unke man ko cheer diya tha
 Ajmal Kasab and Ismail Khan came inside the station, spraying bullets and throwing grenades
 unhone 58 logon ko maaraa or 104 ko ghayal kar diya
 He killed one-third of the 166 people killed in the Mumbai terror attack
 kasaab or khan ne stesan se baahar nikalne ke baad bhi hatyaon kaa silsilaa jari rakhaa
 The two also killed nine policemen, including two killed in Cama Hospital, six in a police car that also included ATS chief Hemant Karkare, Ashok Kamte and Senior Inspector Vijay Salaskar, and later Bahadur Assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Ombale, Who captured Kasab on Girgaum Chapati
 saamaajik kaaryakarta kishor bhatta un logon main the, jinhone kasaab ko 26 november, 2008 ko der raat police kii giraft main sabase pehle dekha
 "he was brought to Nair Hospital for treatment," Bhatt said
 vah pulisavaalon se gidgidaa rahaa tha ki mujhe maar do, meraa mishan puraa ho gaya he
 The Indian government finally fulfilled his wish
 —saath main devesh kumaar Congress Vice President Ahul Gandhi has accused the Narendra Modi government of 'politics of revenge', while BJP MP Anurag Thakur hit back at Rahul's attack, saying that Rahul makes statements without doing 'homework'
 thakur ne rahul gandhi par logon ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Anurag Thakur, who came to attend an event in Ayodhya, said, 'the person who slept for five years Kumbhakarna
 use homework karne kii aadat nahin he or vah mega food park ke maamle par janata ko gumraah kar rahaa he
 He said that the company, which wanted to build a food park in Amethi, had given up its intention to pursue the project only during the tenure of the Congress-led UPA government in 2012-13 due to non-availability of gas
 jab yah sab ho rahaa tha, us vakt rahul kya kar rahe the?halki raajnneetik karte hai congress upaadhyaksharahul par gambhir aarope lagaate hue bhajayumo adhyaksh ne kaha 'rahulahalki raajnneeti karte hai
 He is misleading the public by lying
 ' congress par bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak ko lekar bhi tarah-tarah kii juthi baaten prachaarit karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha 'congress galat baat failaa rahi he
 We have asked for four times the compensation for land acquisition and to give job to a member of the affected family
 congress kahati he ki centre sabhi kisaanon kii jameen le legi, jo ki bilkul galat he
 'anurag said that only 0 for the identified development projects

 US President Barack Obama announced his new anti-terrorism policies, calling the use of drone strikes as 'just, effective and necessary' for self-defense against terrorists, limiting the use of drones in countries such as Pakistan
 obama ne neshnal dephence uniwarsity main aatankwaad nirodhak nitiyon ke khilaaf bhaashan main kaha ki vah drone ke istemaal ko kam karenge, guantanamo be sthit aatanki hiraasatgah band karenge or apni hi yudhak shakti par nai simaaen lagane kii koshish karenge
 Obama, for the first time, privately admitted that many Americans living abroad have also been killed in drone strikes, but he made the use of unmanned armed aircraft 'drones' to target important terrorist targets 'legal' and extremely Told 'effective' weapon
 is tarah unhone yah sanket diya ki unka prashasan aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh main drone kaa istemaal jari rakhega
 The US President said, "we are at war with an organization that if we do not stop earlier, it will kill as many Americans as it can
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘isliye yah nyyochit he, yah ek aisi ladaai he jo aatmaraksha ke liye or apane antim upaay ke taur par ladi ja rahi he
 Obama confirmed that he had signed the guidelines a day before for drone strikes
 iske tahat hamale keval aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf hi adhikrut honge jo americanyon ke liye ek ‘satat or nikatavarti khatra’ he or ye hamale tab hi kiye jaaenge jab is baat kii ‘lagbhag nischitata’ hogi ki is hamale main naagarik nahin maare jaaenge yaa ve ghayal nahin honge
 He said that civilian deaths due to drone attacks 'disturbed' him, but added that this risk should be balanced based on the threats from terrorist groups that specifically target civilians
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch nahin karnaa koi vikalp nahin he
 Obama said that beyond Afghanistan, America only targets Al Qaeda and its supporting forces and the use of drones is a big compulsion
 obama ne alqaida sargana osama bin laden ko maarane ke liye chalaae gaye commando abhiyaan ko ek maanak maanane se inkaar karte hue kaha ki america duusare deshon kii samprabhutaa kaa sammaan karata he
 He said that such campaigns (like the campaign to kill bin Laden) cannot be the norm
 obama ne kaha, ‘pakistan main osama bin laden ke khilaaf hamaara abhiyaan maanak nahin ho saktaa
 There were many risks in this case
 hamaari praathamikta use pakadaney kii thi, haalanki yah sambhaavna bahut kam thi
 It was decided that our people would face obstacles
 ’unhone kaha, ‘hamane nagarikon ko nahin maaraa or na hi ham ek vistrut yuddh main uljhe
 This was the result of the excellent planning and professionalism of our special forces but it all depends on luck
 ise afghanistan main vyapak avasanrachana se sahyog mila tha
 He also called for a change in its counter-terrorism strategy, describing America as standing on a fork
 obama ne kaha, ‘hamaari ladaai ab ek nae charan main pravesh kar rahi he, aise main america kaa aatmaraksha kaa tarksangat daawa is puri charchaa kaa ant nahin kar saktaa
 Describing a military option as legitimate or effective does not mean that the option is intelligent or moral in every situation
 jis tarakkee ne hamen lagbhag aadhi duniya par hamale kii takanic di he, vah is shakti par niyantran kaa anushaasan bhi chaahati he
 Otherwise, be prepared to face the risk of its misuse
 ’obama ne kaha, ‘isliye pichley chaar saalon main mere prashasan ne aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf hamaari senaaon ke upyog ke liye ek ruparekha sthapit karne ke uddeshy se puure josh ke saath kaam kiya
 This framework emphasizes clear guidelines, vision and accountability
 ise raashtrapati ke nitigat nirdeshon main shaamil kiya gaya he jis par maine hastakshar kiye hai
 Obama said that armed drones have become a major weapon in America's 'war on terror' but their use raises many complex legal and conduct issues beyond practical arguments as to whether drone strikes are effective or not
 america raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘afgaan yuddh main hamen apane sainikon ko tab tak sahyog karnaa he jab tak 2014 ke ant tak hone vaala satta hastantaran puraa nahin ho jaataa
 This means that we will continue to have drone strikes against Al Qaeda targets and forces that support attacks on coalition forces
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar hamaare paas akele aatankiyon ko pakadaney kii kshamta hoti he to america drone hamale nahin karata
 Our priority has always been to apprehend them, interrogate them and then prosecute them
 america kahin bhi apni marji se hamale nahin kar saktaa
 "we should not call our efforts a 'boundless global war on terror' (targeted global war on terror), rather targeted and sustained efforts to eliminate the special networks of those violent extremists posing a threat to America," Obama said
 Is a series of kai maamalon main isamen duusare deshon kii bhagidaari bhi hogi
 On the issue of Guantanamo, Obama said that he had stopped sending detainees to Yemen in 2010, which he is now removing
 yah roak tab lagaai gai thi jab yah pataa chalaa tha ki ant:vastron main bam chhipaane vaale umr faruk abdulamutalab ko yaman main prashikshan diya gaya tha
 He said he would appoint a new ambassador to the Foreign Ministry and an officer in the Ministry of Defense, who would hold talks with other countries on the transfer of detainees to Guantanamo
 unhone kaha ki vah kuch bandiyon ke sthanantaran par lagi roak hataa rahe hai
 Obama spoke of closing it (the Guantanamo detention center) the very first year of his office
 lekin unke ye prayaas republican saansadon ke kaaran naakaam ho gaye jinhone aatankwaad ke sandigdhon par america or un deshon main mukadmaa chalaane kaa virodh kiya tha, jin deshon ne kuch bandiyon ko lene se manaa kar diya tha

 lihaaja is bajet ke jariye sarkaar beete chaar saal kii apni uplabdhi ko kendra main rakhane kii koshish karegi
 It will also try to show its economic policy in the right direction through this last full budget, based on the four budgets presented till date
 isse pehle aap kendra sarkaar ke is sabase mahatvapurn bajet kii baarikiyon ko samajhe yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki beete chaar bajaton ke jariye kendra sarkaar ne apni aarthik niti ko kis tarah gadha he
 First Budget 2014-15 In the beginning of FY 2014, where the ruling Manmohan government presented the interim budget, in june-july, the new Modi government established in the center presented its first budget
 is bajet ko pesh karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki desh kii janata ne tej aarthik growth ke jariye desh se garibi ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye nai sarkaar chuni he
 According to Jaitley, through the 2014 election results, 1
25 billion people of the country blew up against unemployment, poor infrastructure, shabby infrastructure and corrupt administration
 lihaaja, modi sarkaar ne apane pehle bajet ke jariye desh kii arthvyavastha ko 7-8 fisadi growth kii growth trek par daalane ke saath sab kaa saath sab kaa vikaas kaa mul mantra diya
 Second Budget 2015-16 Presenting its second budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley claimed in Parliament that the credibility of the Indian economy has strengthened during the 9-month tenure of the Modi government
 iske saath hi jetali ne kaha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha tej raftaar pakadaney ke liye taiyaar he

 is bajet main kendra sarkaar ne jiesti or jandhan, aadhaar or mobile ke jariye diarect benefit transfar ko launch karne ke liye kade aarthik sudhaaron kii disha main kadam badhaayaa
 Third Budget 2016-17: Despite the increase in challenges at the global level before this budget, the central government had good growth figures
 antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne bharat ko sust padi vaishvik arthvyavasthaaon ke bich ek brit spot ghoshit kiya
 In this budget, apart from global sluggishness, big domestic expenditure was a big challenge before the central government
 jahaan bajet main saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon kaa phayda karmchaaree tak pahunchane ke liye bade kharch hone the vahiin desh main lagaataar do baar se monsoon kamjor rahane se agriculture sector bade sankat main tha

 Fourth Budget: Before presenting the fourth budget in the term of 2017-18 Modi government, an important decision like demonetisation was taken to curb black money in the country
 is faisle ke baad vaarshik bajet ke saamne simatati maang badi chunauti bani
 Where the growth in the country had gained momentum during the last two budgets, the challenges were facing the central government in this budget
 is bajet main kendra sarkaar ko vaishvik str par badhate kachche tel kii keemten ek baar phir pareshaan karne lagi thim
 Apart from this, during July 2017, the growth of GST in the country was showing signs of shock

 Just before the commencement of the budget session of Parliament, the Congress had made its strategy clear about the budget
 party ke varisht pravaktaa arpyen singh ne baqayada elaan kiya ki bajet kaa matlab jumalon kii barish hoga
 The Congress also showed its attitude on Wednesday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood in the Lok Sabha to express his thanks for the President's address
 sadan main pradhanmantri ke bolne se pehle hi andhra pradesh ke tidipi saansad rajya ko vishesh darja dene kii maang ko lekar wel main aakar naare laga rahe the
 As soon as the PM stood up to speak, he also looked towards the sitting Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 rajnath singh ne piem ko aashwast karne ke andaaj main sanket diya ki naare lagane vaale ab apni siton par chale jaaenge
 After this, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anant Hegde and Arjun Meghwal also requested TDP mps shouting slogans to go to their seats
 iskaa asar hua or tidipi saansad apni siton kii ore jane bhi lage
 Seeing the TDP mps returning to seats, some Congress mps took a dig that now Andhra did not want special status, fixing was done
 is par congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya or venugopal kii tidipi saansadon se kuch takaraar bhi hui
 As soon as the Andhra mps reached their seats, the party MP came in the well as soon as the Congress high command got a hint
 iske baad pradhanmantri dedh ghante tak bhaashan dete rahe or jab tak ve bole congress saansad wel main jor jor se naare lagaate rahe
 They were shouting slogans - what happened in the Rafael Deal? What happened to employment, what happened to farmers, what happened to 15 lakhs, stop jumlebaazi, stop lying etc
 naare lagane ke saath wo rafel ko lekar placord bhi dikhaate rahe
 PM Modi completed his speech amid this noise
 piem kaa bhaashan khatm hote hi sonia gandhi ne media se bina camere or rahul ne camere par baat karke modi par palatwaar kiya
 Seeing the aggressive attitude of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, it seemed that the BJP does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha, in such a situation, when Modi speaks here, the Congress mps will increase the difficulty
 lekin hua thik ulat
 On the lines of the Lok Sabha, Modi in his speech in the Rajya Sabha targeted fiercely at the nehru-gandhi family and the Congress
 bhrashtachar or boforce kaa naam lekar grand old party kii khub laanat-malaanat kii
 But unlike the Lok Sabha, the Congress MP did not come in the well
 wo bich bich main tikaa- tippanee karke vipaksh hone kii rasm adaayagi jarur karte rahe
 In such a situation, after the view of Lok Sabha, there were speculations that there would be a lot of uproar during PM Modi's speech in Rajya Sabha, nothing happened
 party sutron ke mutabikarajyasabha main piem ke bhaashanke dauraan wel main aakar hangaamaa nahin kar paane kii apni tis he
 In fact, the problem of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha is that most of the Congress leaders in the upper house are either elderly or very senior
 aise main itani der tak wel main lagaataar hangaamaa yaa narebaaji kar paanaa mumkin nahin he
 a senior leader told 'aaj Tak' that there are many youths in the Kiloksabha like Congress' Pasushmita Dev, Ranjit Ranjan, Gaurav Gogoi, Deepender Hooda, Ninong Iring, KC Venugopal, k Suresh, Rajeev Satava and Jyotiraditya Scindia
 vahiin rajyasabha main gulam nabi aaazaad, ahamed patel, ambika soni, anand sharma, jairam ramesh, pi
 Chidambaram, Manmohan Singh, AK Antony, Mohsina Kidwai, Digvijay Singh are elderly and senior leaders
 rajyasabha main congress ke baaki sadasyon main bhi khaase umradraj hai
 Renuka Chaudhary, Rajiv Gowda, Kumari Selja, Rajiv Shukla are among the leaders around the age of 60 in the Upper House
 kul milakar rajyasabha main congress ke paas yuvaaon kaa tota he
 In such a situation, the Congress may have to face two-four problems in the Rajya Sabha by making a strategy to surround the government

 ' Lok Janshakti Party MP Chirag Paswan has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, which has increased the difficulties of the Central Government
 chiraag paswan ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khat likhakar kaha ki 20 march ko supreme court ke jaj eke goyal ne SC / ST (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium par faisla sunaaya gaya tha
 This has caused resentment and resentment in the Scheduled Castes and Tribes community
 chiraag paswan ne kaha ki supreme court ke is faisle ke khilaaf anusuchit jati or janajati varg ne do farvari ko andolan ke dauraan ugr pradarshan kiya tha, jiske chalate janmaal kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua tha or hamaari endie sarkaar ke khilaaf anusuchit jati or janajati ke logon main bina vajah avishvaas kaa maahaul bana
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have once again called for a Bharat Bandh on August 9
 is baar pradarshan or zyaada ugr hone kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi hai, jisko dekhte hue hamen uchit kadam uthaane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Chirag Paswan said that the Supreme Court judge AK Goyal, who ruled the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act, has been made the chairman of the National Green Tribunal after retirement
 sarkaar ke is faisle se anusuchit jati or janajaatiy main sandesh gaya ki sarkaar ne SC / ST ke khilaaf faisla sunaane ke liye justise eke goyal ko puraskrit kiya he
 Chirag Paswan made this demand in front of PM Modi
 In a letter written to PM Modi, he said that on August 9, there should be no violence again, you should take these steps
 
 
 
 1 - Government should immediately dismiss AK Goel as the chairman of National Green Tribunal
 2 - sansad ke isi monsoon satr main SC / ST (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium par supreme court ke faisle ke khilaaf sanshodhit bill laayaa jaae, jisamen anusuchit jati or janajatiy kii suraksha ko phir se behaal kiya ja sake
 If there is any difficulty in this, then the session of Parliament should be brought to an ordinance on August 8, instead of August 10
 isse anusuchit or janajati varg ke bich sarkaar ke prati vishwaas kaa maahaul paidaa hoga
 Also, before March 20, the situation will be restored and the loss due to Bharat Bandh on August 9 will be prevented

 Apart from this, it is not easy for the Modi government to accept the demand to remove AK Goyal as the chairman of National Green Tribunal
 agar sarkaar aisa karti he, to yah sandesh jayega ki sarkaar ne apane ghatak dal ke dabaav main aakar aisa faisla liya he
 If the Modi government is considering bringing the ordinance, then the Modi government is considering bringing an ordinance on the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act after the monsoon session of Parliament

 So far, Chikungunya has emerged as a new villain for Dengue, who is suffering from havoc
 jis chikangunia ko doctor ab tak dengue se kam khatarnaak bataate rahe hai, vahi chikangunia ab achaanak jaanaleva beemaari kii shakl akhriyaar kar chukaa he
 The public as well as the doctors were surprised when the news of the first death from Chikungunya came from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital
 ye samajhnaa mushkil tha ki aakhir machharon se hone vaali ye beemaari achaanak itani khatarnaak kaise ho gai
 Doctors believe - Chikungunya is not lethal before Chikungunya started hunting the patients one after the other before the doctors and health department could get a proper idea of the situation
 mangalvaar shaam tak desh kii rajdhani menchikanguniyaase hone vaali mauton kaa aankada paanch tak pahunch gaya
 Four of these deaths occurred in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital only
 sar ganga ram aspataal ke alaava hindu raav aspataal main bhi ek marij ne chikangunia kii vajah se dam tod diya
 However, doctors believe that chikungunya alone is not so dangerous
 lekin agar marij ko diabete, asthma yaa dil kii beemaari pehle se ho to aise marijon ke liye chikangunia jaanaleva ban saktaa he
 AIIMS doctors also believe that it is an epidemic
 lekin dilli ke swasthy mantri to maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki chikangunia beemaari bhi he
 If a minister has more power than a doctor, then he can speak anything
 ye alag baat he ki artitect kii padhai kar swasthya mantri bane satyendra jain khud ko doctor bhi maanane lage hai
 But the question is not about the minister's budding, the question is of these five deaths from Chikungunya
 har jagah bade maamleye sawaal har jahan main uth saktaa he ki pehali maut 1 sitabanr ko hui to kya is beete 12 dinon main or bhi mautein hui hongi jinaki pushti abhi tak nahin hui he, kyonki ek taraf emsidi ke aankde kah rahe hai ki dilli main ab tak chikangunia ke 1724 maamle aae hai, jabaki sach ye he ki desh ke sabase bade aspataal ames main hi aane vaale kul maamalon main chikangunia ke 60 fisadi maamle hai
 There are 1360 chikungunya cases in AIIMS, while 775 in Apollo, 531 in Safdarjung, 375 in RML, 145 in BL Kapoor, 82 in Bada Hindu Rao and 65 in Gangaram
 hawaii daawey karne kaa daur jariyani kii apollo aspataal se lekar safadarajang aaramail samet tamaam aspataalon main chikangunia ke saikadon posetive cese paae gaye hai
 In terms of statistics, more than 3300 cases have been reported in only seven major hospitals in the capital
 chote-bade saare aspataalon kaa kul aankada kahin zyada he
 But look at the irony that no one is responsible for deaths and nobody is responsible for spreading disease
 aaropon kaa khel jari he, or hawaii daawey karne main kisi ko parhez nahin

 anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal kii raah kis tarah juda ho gai, yah to puure desh ne dekha
 But the curtain has not yet been fully lifted from many mysteries
 un donon ke bich algaav kii ek vajah upie ke kaarykaal ke dauraan PMO kii ek choti-si bhul bhi ho sakati he
 According to an English newspaper report, then foreign minister Salman Khurshid had a secret meeting with Anna Hazare in Pune, according to an English newspaper report
 is baithak ke baad PMO ne anna ke naam ek chitti bheji, jo bhul se arvind kejariwal ke ghar pahunchaa di gai
 However, Anna himself gave Kejriwal's home address as his correspondence address
 par tab PMO ko is baat kaa abhas nahin tha ki is tarah kii gopneey chitthee sidhe anna hajaare ke gaanv ke pate par bhijwai jaani chahie
 When Arvind Kejriwal came to know about this 'mission' of Khurshid, he became cautious
 tab unhone manmohan singh sarkaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah unke or anna hajaare ke bich daraar daalane kii koshish kar rahi he
 In fact, it was evident from the letter that Khurshid had convinced Anna Hazare to campaign in favor of Congress in the 2014 general elections
 chitthee main anna ko iske liye dhanyavad diya gaya tha
 But after reaching the letter of Kejriwal's house, the whole matter got worse
 jahaan tak salmaan khurshid kii baat he, jab unhen is bhul kaa pataa chalaa, to ekadam sann rah gaye
 Despite this, he denied that he had any secret meeting with Anna
 report ke mutabik, anna ne khud hi khurshid ko sujhava diya tha ki agar media main is tarah kii jaankaree li ho jaae, to ve meeting kii baat se saaf mukar jaaen or 'deshhit main' jhooth bol den
 Kiran Bedi was also with Anna at that time in Pune
 anna ne unase bhi jaankaree chhupaai thi
 He told Kiran Bedi that he was going to meet a saint, who wanted to meet him alone
 meeting main khurshid ne anna ke saamne sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 He cautioned Anna about Kejriwal's political ambitions
 anna us vakt sarkari lokapal bill se santusht the, jab kejariwal ne use 'jokapaal' qaraar diya tha
 From here, the paths of both were separated

 The boy told, 'we fell in love at one sight
 lekin ladki kii fimali iske sakht khilaaf thi kyonki main dalit hum or wo bahman he
 So we decided to run away and start our new life somewhere
 2011 main hamane ek mandir main shaadi kar lee thi

 ' gurjaron ne apni jid ke aage rajasthan sarkaar ko ghutane techne par bhale hi majaboor kar diya ho, par kanoon haath main lene ke chalate court unhen bakhshane ke mood main nahin he
 While giving a big verdict on the case, the High Court has ordered action against the protesters

 27 july ko rajya kii aarthik aparaadh shakha (iodblyoo) ne do logon ko giraftaar kiya
 One, Nirmal Awasthi who was appointed as a telephone operator at the residence of the former minister and the other, his OSD Virender Pandey
 donon par jal sansaadhan vibhaag (dablyuardy) ke i-tender ko tay karne kii sajeesh rachane or online seva pradaan karne vaale portal kaa kaamkaaj dekhne vaale vibhaag ke ejiniyaron or ek nijee company ke saath mileebhagat karne kaa aarope he
 Awasthi and Pandey are currently in judicial custody
 sutron kaa kahana he ki mishra ke nijee staff ke in do vyaktiyon kii bhoomika tender tay karne kii prakriya main bicheliye kii thi
 Manish Khare, another intermediary arrested in May, pointed out his role in this regard, clearly mentioning his name
 khare or un donon karmchaariyon ke khilaaf gujarat kii ek form ko 116 karod rupye kaa tender dene kaa aarope he
 However, former minister Mishra alleges that both of them are being pressured to add their names to the scam
 ve kehete hai, ''i-tender dene kii prakriya main varisht adhikari shaamil rahete hai, 
 
 
 Class 3 and 4 level employees cannot manipulate this
 ''avasthi or pandey kii patniyon ne bhi hycourt main arji daayar kii he ki unke patiyon ko mantri mishra ko fansaane ke liye istemaal karne ke liye pakadaa gaya he
 They allege that after the fall of the congress-jd (S) government in Karnataka, the ruling party is apprehensive that it may lose the chair even in Madhya Pradesh, hence the opposition leaders are being harassed by putting pressure on them
 yah sach he ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad pichley shashan ke kathith ghotaalon kii jaanch main teji ai he
 (during the elections, its view was clearly seen in the IT raids at the residences of Chief Minister Kamal Nath's associates and relatives)
 lekin bhopal ke rajnatik galiyare main isamen koi hairaani nahin jataai ja rahi he ki mishra aaropon kii jad main hai
 Mishra is an expert in politics manipulation and he is credited with bringing Congress mlas Chaudhary Rakesh Singh and Sanjay Pathak to the BJP
 ve kamalnath sarkaar ko giraane ke liye congress ke kuch vidhayakon ko apane paale main laane kii baat par bhi mukhar rahe hai
 He is also considered close to BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah
 kendriya grih mantralay ne mishra kii suraksha badhaate hue unhen vaai shrenee kii suraksha di he, jo saamaanya taur par vidhayakon ko nahin milti
 That is, by increasing the heat on him, Kamal Nath is pursuing a political cause
 avasthi pehle mishra ke paas nijee haisiyat se naukari kiya karte the, lekin ek saal pehle unhen kanoon vibhaag main chaparasi kii naukari mil gai thi
 Mishra was also a minister in the Law Department
 duusari taraf, virendra pandey kai varshon se mishra ke saath hai or jal sansaadhan vibhaag main tritiy shrenee ke karmchaaree hai
 Awasthi and Pandey are currently in the custody of the Economic Offenses Wing
 agar unhone jabaan kholi to mishra ke liye mushkil khadi ho sakati he
 The agency is also investigating an earlier case in 2008 in which the Income Tax Department had seen wires between Mishra and suspected businessman Mukesh Sharma
 mishra us samay shahari prashasan mantri the or sharma ke ghar par mili dastavej dikhaate hai ki mishra ko hyderabad kii ek company ne paise die
 The former minister claims that he was acquitted by the IT department in that case
 lekin, aarthik aparaadh shakha ek alag agency he
 Meanwhile, state sources say the investigation into pension scandals of Vyapam and Indore is likely to resume, which allegedly included BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya
 vijayawargeey madhya pradesh main bahut kam rahete hai
 He is the party in-charge of West Bengal, but usually keeps his eyes on the Madhya Pradesh and Kamal Nath governments

 - Investor should first identify their financial goals
 use yah jaananaa chahie ki aane vaale samay main kin-kin chizon ke liye paise kii kitni zarurat hogi
 
 
 For example, if there is a young investor and he has to buy a house, then he will have to do this work within the next few years
 - bacchon kii ucch shiksha or shaadi jaisi chizon ke liye lanbaa samay lagata he, isliye use isi aadhaar par apni nivesh kii yojanaayen banani hongi, taaki jis vaqt use jis kaam ke liye zarurat he, us vaqt use utana paisa mil jaae
 After this, the investor has to see how much risk he can take
 isi aadhaar par use equity yaa mutual fund main paisa nivesh karnaa chahie
 - Often people resort to real estate or gold to invest money, while in the long run, a little investment in equity can give you good returns
 tippaniyan - Investor also needs to see how long he can invest continuously
 - kul milakar nivesh kaa lakshya yah hona chahie ki aap mahangaai dar se hone vaale nuksaan se batch jaaen, balki mahangaai dar se kam se kam do fisadi ritern aapako zyaada milanaa chahie, taaki jab aap apni jamaa hui rakam ko baahar nikaalen to us samay ke hisaab se aapke liye vah paisa ek badi puunji sabit ho
 - It takes a long time for things like higher education and marriage of children, so he has to make his investment plans on this basis, so that he gets that much money at the time for which he needs it
 -iske baad niveshak ko ye dekhnaa hoga ki vah kitna jokhim le saktaa he
 On this basis, he should invest money in equity or mutual funds
 -aksar log paise ke nivesh ke liye real estate yaa sone kaa hi sahaara lete hai jabaki lambey vaqt main equity main thodaa-thodaa nivesh aapako acha faaydaa de saktaa he
 The comments - niveshak ko yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki vah kitne samay tak lagaataar nivesh kar saktaa he
 Overall, the goal of investment should be that you should avoid the loss due to inflation, rather you should get at least two percent return more than the inflation rate, so that when you withdraw your accumulated amount then According to that money should prove to be a big capital for you

 That little conversation was so adopted that it was a lot of fun
 laga hi nahin ki isse pehle kabhi hamaari baatcheet nahin hui
 During the conversation Aziz also asked to meet
 unhone kaha- jab bhi idhar (mumbai) aana ho, mujhe bhi bataa dena
 i would like to meet you

 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha ki agar sena kaa jawan apni baat sidhe soshal media main rakhata he to yah sena ke anushaasan kaa ulanghan he
 The Defense Minister said in the Rajya Sabha that there is a process within the Army regarding complaints and every jawan should follow it
 gauratlab he ki pehle biguef ke jawan tej bahadur or phir sena ke jawan yajna pratap ne apni shikaayat soshal media main rakhi
 While Tej Bahadur talked about the poor quality of his food, Yagya Pratap accused the army officers of exploiting the soldiers
 tippaniyan Parrikar said that posting the problem on social media will not solve the problem
 agar kisi palaton main aisi koi baat hoti he to jawan pehle commanding adhikari yani sio se kahen
 If the jawan is not heard here, then you can say your thing directly to the army chief, either through a letter or through a whatsapp number
 or agar sena pramukh ke str par bhi shikaayat kaa nipataara nahin hota he to jawan raksha mantri ke paas bhi apni baat kah sakate hai
 According to the Defense Minister, the food quality has improved based on the feed back received from the soldiers
 masalan pehle sena main sthaneey str par chikan kii kharid hoti thi lekin ab frozen chikan bhi kharid sakate hai
 Not only this, now the jawans are given two eggs daily to eat, whereas earlier one egg was given
 raksha mantri ke mutabik feedback or jaankaree ke aadhaar par or bhi sudhaar kiye jate rahenge
 Significantly, first BSF jawan Tej Bahadur and then army jawan Yagya Pratap put their complaint on social media
 tej bahadur ne jahaan apane yahaan khaane kii kharaab quality kii baat kii to vahiin yajna pratap ne sena ke adhikariyon par javaanon kaa shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 The comments parrikar ne kaha ki soshal media main samasya post karne se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 If there is such a thing in a platoon, the jawans should first tell the commanding officer, ie CO
 agar yahaan bhi jawan kii baat nahin suni jaati he to sidhe sena pramukh ko apni baat kah sakate hai, yaa to chitthee ke jariye yaa phir whatsap number ke jariye
 And if the grievance is not resolved even at the level of the Chief of Army Staff, the jawans can also speak to the Defense Minister
 raksha mantri ke mutabik javaanon se mili feed back ke aadhaar par khaane kii quality main sudhaar hua he
 For example, earlier the army used to buy chicken locally but now can also buy frozen chicken
 itnaa hi nahin ab javaanon ko rojaanaa do andey khaane ko die jate hai jabaki pehle ek anda diya jaataa tha

 The eldest daughter of Maharaja Harinder Singh Brar, the late ruler of the princely state of Faridkot in Punjab, 80-year-old Amrit Kaur sits in her simplistic drawing room in Sector 11, Chandigarh
 unhen katai yakeen nahin ho rahaa he ki unhen 20,000 karod ru
 The property of has been declared a co-heir
 25 july ko mukhya nyaayik magistrate rajnish kumaar sharma kii adaalat ne do dashakon se chali aa rahi ladaai kaa ant karte hue faisla sunaaya ki maharaja kii vasiyat farji thi
 The Maharaja died in 1989
 adaalat ne kaha ki unki sampatti unki do jivit vaarison amrit cor or 77 varshiya deepinder cor ko milani chahie
 The property was managed by the Mehrwal Khewaji Trust
 deepinder kii shaadi pashchim bengal main bardwan ke ek mashhoor jameendaar parivaar ke saday chand mehtab ke saath hui thi
 The property includes a palace in Punjab, a fort and an airport, Manimajra Fort in Haryana, an airstrip and farming land, land in Mashobra in Himachal Pradesh, Faridkot House on Delhi's Copernicus Marg and two flats in Hyderabad
 maharaja ke paas wintage kaaron kaa sangrah, bank balance or jevaraat bhi the
 Initial estimates put the total value of this property at around Rs 20,000 crore
 he
 Giving the verdict in favor of Amrit Kaur, who challenged the will in the court, Chief Judicial Magistrate Sharma said that the will was bogus so that the property of the Maharaja falls into the trust
 is trust kaa prabandh unki teen betiyon main se ek beti (deepinder cor), unke sevakon or vakeelon ke haath main tha
 This trust was formed in 1986
 1982 main taiyaar kii gai yah vasiyat 1989 main maharaja ke nidhan ke baad saamne ai
 Amrit Kaur says that she has got a lot of 'shahat' from the court's decision
 ve kahati hai, ‘‘1981 main ek sadak haadase main mere bhai tikka harmohinder singh baraar kii maut ke baad mere pita gahare depressant main chale gaye the
 Taking advantage of his ill health, his servants got a fake will in connivance with some lawyers and formed a trust and became a member
 ’’farji vasiyat ke mutabik, do betiyon deepinder or mahipinder ko kramash: 1,200 ru
 And Rs 1,000
 kaa masik vetan tay kar diya gaya
 Nothing was given to the Maharaja's eldest daughter Amrit Kaur, wife Narinder Kaur or her mother Mohinder Kaur
 maharaja kii maa or patni, donon hi us samay jivit thim
 The Maharaja's third daughter Mahipinder Kaur died in Mashobra, Shimla in 2001
 amrit cor ne 1992 main court kaa darwaja khatkhataya or tab se adalati ladaai lard rahi thim
 She says, "my father was cheated on
 isliye mukadmaa laduya jaruri tha
 It is not just about money
 is dhokhadhadi ko saamne laana jaruri tha
 During the trial, the trust's lawyer once told the court that the Maharaja was very angry with his daughter Amrit Kaur as she married against the father's will, so no property was given to her
 amrit cor ise sire se khaarij karte hue kahati hai, ‘‘mere pita ne kabhi koi vasiyat nahin banaai
 i was with him till his death
 mere paas unka likhaa ek patr bhi he, jisamen unhone mere pati harpal singh (ve ab 90 varsh ke hai or haryana rajya vidyut board main satark ta vibhaag ke diji ke pad se ritair ho chuke hai) se kaha tha ki shaadi ke liye ve apane mehmaanon kii suchi unhen bhej den
 "chandigarh-based lawyer Manjit Singh Khaira, who advocates on behalf of Amrit Kaur, says," Such a big fraud is rarely seen
 kya aap soch sakate hai ki unhone (trustiyon ne) sampatti or saamaan kii suchi tak nahin banaai
 He claims that after the Maharaja's death there was nothing but a will in his vault in Mashobra
 yah kis tarah kaa trust he, jisamen na to koi labhaarthi he or na hi seva kaa koi praavdhaan he?unka kahana he, maharaja chaahate the ki teen sampatti ko chhodkar baaki kii sampatti ko vyavsaayik istemaal ke liye rakhaa jaae
 We do not believe it at all
 ’’ trust ke agxcutive sadsy lalit gupta ne kaha ki jab tab ve adaalat ke aadesh ko thik se nahin pard lete, tab tak ve koi tippanee nahin kar sakate
 But an earlier media report told them that they would appeal against the decision
 trust ke upaadhyaksh or deepinder cor ke putr jayachand mehtab se kolkata main unke ghar par phone se sampark kiya gaya to unhone kuch bhi bolne se manaa kar diya
 The second edition of the State of Historical Accounts of Faridkot comes in January and is sponsored by the Trust
 iske lekhak amarjit dhillon ne canada ke ontario main apane ghar se india today ko bheje gaye ek email main likhaa he, ‘‘yah apil ke liye upyukt maamla lagata he
 As far as i know, there was no fraud committed in the will
 is vasiyat ke 7 saal baad tak maharaja jivit the
 If it was fake, they could have changed it
 ’’ amrit cor kahati hai, ‘‘main ant tak ladgaye ke liye taiyaar hum
 Ever since i filed the lawsuit, i was not allowed to set foot in any of my father's property
 yahaan tak ki us rajmahal main bhi nahin, jahaan main paidaa hui or pali-badi
 "when she was asked what she would do with this wealth, she said after being silent for some time," i have not thought about it yet

 Controversy has arisen in the matter of comparing Army Chief Major General Bipin Rawat to British General Dyer in his article by Bengal famous author Partha Chatterjee
 unhone ek lekh main kashmir main maanav dhaal vaali ghatana ke sandarbh main general ravat kii tulana diar se kar di he
 When Aaj Tak tried to take his side in this regard, he was adamant on his point
 unhone kaha, main jo kahana chahta tha wo main kah chukaa hum
 i have written my arguments as clearly as i could
 ab mere paas isamen or adhik jodne ko kuch nahin he
 "after this, Aaj Tak's team tried to get some opinions from other politicians about it
 kuch logon main pakistan bolta habengal ke prasiddh lekhak partha chatterjee dwaara army chif major jarnal ravat kii tulana jarnal diar se karne ke baad chatterjee kii chautarafa ninda shuru ho gai he
 Haryana cabinet minister Anil Vij fiercely attacked writer Chatterjee for comparing the army chief to the journal Dyer
 vij ne kaha ki kuch logon main aaj bhi pakistan bolta he, aise log pakistan kii tarafdaari karte hai
 Vij said that when the terrorists wreak havoc in India, the ink of their pen dries up and they do not write anything
 kashmir main hamaare sainikon par patharav hota he tab vah kuch nahin likhte or agar unke khilaaf kaarywai kii jaae to yah jehar uglana shuru kar dete hai
 Haryana's domineering minister Anil Vij termed Bengal's famous writer Partha Chatterjee as a defunct piece, saying that it is the job of a headless man to compare today's army chief with the journal Dyer
 jarnal diar ne maanavtaa ke viruddh aparaadh kiya tha or hamaare army chif maanavtaa ko bachaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Unnecessarily questioning the army is not good
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, "porthha Chatterjee is a writer
 She should keep in mind that it is the army that fights floods, railway accidents and enemies on the border
" pioke main sargical strike kar yaa noshera main dushman ke bunker uda kar hamaari raksha karti he
 It is not right to compare the army chief to General Dyer who murdered women, children
 jab tak sena he tabhi tak ham surakshit hai
 The way Major Gogoi saved the lives of the people without firing them, then they should be praised instead of questioning them
 portha chatterjee kii hi tarah pi chidambaram ne bhi major gogoi par sawaal uthaae the ye thik nahin he
 Everyone has the right to speak his words in freedom of expression
 lekin sena par bevajaah sawaal uthaanaa thik nahin he
 "he is a traitor, he is not aware of history
 ke
 Singh said, "do not call such a person a scholar
 vah gaddaar he
 He does not know history
 general diar ne mashin gan chalaa kar saikadon logon kii hatya kii thi
 It is not right to compare Army Chief and General Dyer
 iskaa matlab vah scollar nahin he
 See this thing hurts us
 aise log hamaare desh ke andar maujuud hai
 Our soldiers do not have this problem when they sacrifice their lives
 unako yah takalif tab hoti he jab sena kisi ke upar karwai karti he
 Takes action on miscreants
 jab ek army officer ko jab vah chuttee par gaya hua tha usko maaraa tab unhone usko condam nahin kiya
 These are all traitorous people
 aise logon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai honi chahie
 "RK Singh further said," These people are traitors
 When army soldiers are killed, why didn't they fucking say it? army chif ne jo kiya vah sahi kiya he
 That is exactly what Major Gogoi has done
 main inke saath hum
 The comparison of General Dyer to the Army Chief is not worthy of justification
 kahaan to saikadon logon ko maaraa gaya or kahaan ek vyakti ko jeep par baandh kar usko koi injuri bhi to hui nahin, thodi maansik haraasament hui hogi
 Action should be taken against a person who throws stones
 updrav jab hota he us vakt karrwai karte to thik rahata he
 If he takes action after the nuisance starts, more people are harmed
 is ghatana se pathar waalon ko sandesh mila
 There was an effective action that sent a message to the stone-pelters
 pathar phenkane kii ghatana main kami ai
 Perfect action has taken place
