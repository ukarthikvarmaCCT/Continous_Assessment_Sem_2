 In such a situation, Shivpal's attack on Samajwadi Party every day can increase the headache of nephew Akhilesh before the election

 No UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, his father and Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal, an IAS officer posted in Greater Noida
 mukhyamantri karyaalay ke sutron kii maane to somvaar subah tak akhilesh ko is faisle kii jaankaree bhi nahin thi
 He was in Karnataka during that time
 mulaayam singh bhi unke saath hi the
 When he came to know about the matter from a party leader, he directly ordered the officer
 mulaayam singh ke nirdesh ke baad raat main hi mukhyamantri karyaalay kholaa gaya
 Subsequently orders for suspension of Durga Shakti were issued
 durga shakti greater noida main sab diviginal magistrate ke pad par tainaat thim
 After the order was issued, the next day Akhilesh was informed by an officer of the Secretariat
 uske baad media se baat karte hue akhilesh kisi tarah se bas apane faisla kaa bachaav karte najar aae
 The MLA told the leader and the work is done
 There is talk about suspension of young IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal, who is honest and suppressing the mining mafia in the whole country
 aaj ham aapako bataa rahe hai ki durga shakti ko nipataane kaa kaam kisne or kaise kiya
 Samajwadi Party MLA is gautam buddha nagar seat se
 His family were engaged in sand and sand mining since Mulayam Raj itself
 mayawati raaj main bhi ye dhandha surat badalakar jari rahaa
 Then he got the patronage of Babu Singh Kushwaha, who was special to Mayawati at that time
 magar jab se durga shakti nagpal yahaan adhikari banakar ai thim
 Their illegal business was being destroyed
 durga har kaam niyam ke mutabik kar rahi thim
 In such a situation, the MLA was unable to strengthen his case to get him removed
 haalanki durga ke transfar ke liye vidhayak ji pichley hafte hi sapa ke netaa ji yani mulaayam singh yadav se mili the
 The chance was to leave the BSP and go to the BJP and to come to the SP of the wife and brother of the jailed Babu Singh Kushwaha
 chunki vidhayak ji kushvaha ke khaas rahe the, isliye ve bhi lakhanu main is maukey par maujuud the
 Then he cried his grief in front of Netaji
 netaa ji ne aashwaasan diya ki vajah muhaiyaa karaate hi ection liya jayega
 You are lying Akhilesh Yadav, up to today, after this, the MLA then called Mulayam as soon as he came to know about the illegal construction action
 usne bataaya ki netaa ji ek masjid ban rahi thi, jisaki diwaar durga ne girava di
 On hearing this, Mulayam Singh Yadav called Lucknow directly without telling Akhilesh and asked the senior level secretary to issue the suspension order of Durga
 shanivaar raat 1 baje siem daftar kholkar durga shakti nagpal ke nilamban kaa aadesh jari kar diya gaya
 11 on night when the media questioned this action on Sunday
 39 baje ek press relies jari kar di gai
 But CM was not in the state
 to unhen pataa chalaa somvaar kii subah
 Not the leader, Akhilesh has been attacked here when the powerful minister, who has created trouble with his statements and remarks for the Akhilesh government, has said that Akhilesh Yadav had issued the suspension orders, not the leader

 With this, Jinder Mahal retained the title of WWE Championship
 haalanki khali ab dablyoodbalui kaa hissaa nahin he, lekin bettleground main unki entry ne dhamaakaa kar diya
 Khali's entourage in the Cage Khali's entry took place at a time when Randy Orton began to move out of the Cage made of bamboo

 After this Khali twisted his hands
 or unhen baahar nikalne nahin diya
 After this victory, Jinder Mahal and Khali did not consider anything in front of them and declared themselves as better stars than smackdown superstars AJ Styles and John Cena
 aise milti he jeetadrasal, punjabi prijan match jeetne ke liye superstar ko donon kej se baahar aana padataa he
 This cage has four doors and also the referee
 jab superstar darwaja kholane ke liye kahata he to daravaaje se baahar nikalne ke liye sirf ek minute hota he
 The door is closed when it cannot come out in such a time
 itane samay main superstar ko baahar hi aana hota he, pin fall yaa count out is match main koi ahmiyat nahin rakhata
 The first Punjabi prison match ever happened between Big Show and The Undertaker at the Great American Bash in 2006
 haalanki jindar mahal kaa kahana he ki ye match khali kaa banaaya hua he, lekin us samay khali isamen maujuud nahin the

 He resigned from the Congress a day earlier
 patil dakshin mumbai main yojit ek kaarykram main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii maujuudagi main bhaajapa main shaamil hue

 fadanvis ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii drushti kii vajah se log bhaajapa kii ore aakarshith hue hai
 Harshvardhan Patil (harshvardhan Patil) has been a four-time MLA from Indapur seat in Pune district, but he lost the 2014 assembly elections by a close margin to ncp's Dattatreya Bharan
 congress or rakanpa ne pichhlaa chunaav alag-alag ladaa tha

 china kii ek sarkari company main manager ke pad par kaam karne vaali 30 varshiya jing jing ne jab suna ki aamir khan beijing aane vaale hai to ve apana sara kaamkaaj chhodkar unhen dekhne ke liye utaavali ho gayi
 She boarded the cab and went straight to Beijing Airport
 "vahaan maine unase aamane-saamne baat kii
 i can't forget that special day in my life
 '' yah 2015 kii garmiyon kaa samay tha or aamir film pike kii relies ke pramotion ke liye pehali baar beijing pahunche the
 At that time, he was not much popular in China, but a small youth group interested in Indian cinema started to like him
 jing ke mata-pita kii peedi raaj kapur ko khub pasand karti thi or '50 va '60 ke dashak kii bhartiya filmein kaaphi lokapriy thim
 But his children were more interested in the stars of Hollywood, Hong Kong and South Korea
 vahaan pike kii relies kaa aayojan zyada dhoomdhaam se nahin kiya gaya tha or bhartiya filmon ke prati us samay kii ruchi ko dekhte hue yah ek prakaar se trial hi tha
 Could Aamir Khan become the next Raj Kapoor for China? After the popularity of Indian films with Raj Kapoor in the seventies, hardly any Indian film could make its mark
 china main saal main kareeb 30 videshi filmon kii relies kaa kota hota he, jisamen hollywood kii safal filmein hi chai rahati thim
 But Three Idiots changed the whole scenario
 is film ne china main jabardast dhooma machaai
 The film engulfed the hearts and minds of Jing and millions of youth of his age and he became a fan of Aamir
 iske baad jing ne china main pehla aamir khan fain club shuru kiya
 Today his club has around 500 active members and over one lakh fans
 sikret superstarapike kaa prayog kaaphi safal rahaa—yah pehali bhartiya film thi jisane kisi bhi videshi bazaar main 100 karod ru
 Had done business of iske do saal baad dangal ai, jisane jabardast kamyaabi hasil kii or hollywood kii film ko chhod den to yah itihaas main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali videshi film ban gai
 It raised Rs 1,330 crore
 (12
 91 crore RMB)
 is film ke baad to aamir china main logon ke chaheta sitara ban gaye
 In China, Aamir, popularly known as "uncle Aamir", began to be taken house-to-house in China in three years — as Raj Kapoor once did
 dangal itani lokapriy film ho gai ki ise china ke bade netaaon ko dikhaane ke liye jhongananahai compound main vishesh aayojan kiye gaye
 When President Xi Jinping met Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year — the first meeting in Doklam after 72 days of tensions between India and China — he told that he too had seen the film
 40 varshiya jiyanbin jo mukhya rup se dakshin korea or america se videshi media saamagree hasil karne vaali ek company ke liye kaam karte hai, kehete hai, "pike vah mode sabit hui thi jiske baad aamir khan kuch chuninda logon kii pasand ke daayre se baahar nikal kar aam darshak varg ke pasandida sitara ban gaye the
 "jianbin is an active member of the Aamir Khan Fan Club in China
" china main apni baari lokapriyata ke bare main puche jane par aamir kehete hai, "main is baat se behad utsahit hum ki china main log mere kaam ko itnaa zyada pasand karte hai
 i think the emotional strings of the people of China and India are the same and they also have a lot of culturally similarity
 ''jiyanbin kehete hai, "is lokapriyata kaa sabase bada kaaran yah he ki unki filmon main bhavanaaen hoti hai jo darshakon ke dilon ko chhu jaati hai, chaahe vah thri ediyat ho yaa dangal
 Lack of such deep emotion is a major problem in China's film industry
 iske alaava acchhee kahaniyaan bhi nahin hoti hai, jabaki dangal or sikret superstar main ye donon hi baaten hai
 "india's new identity: Amir is getting this success at a time when the new sophisticated audience of China wants to see something different in films
" hollywood kii filmon ko vahaan safalataa milti he lekin ve bhi ab apane charambindu tak pahunch chuki hai
 Popular Chinese actor and Kung Fu star Wang Baokiang, who lent his voice for the main character in the Chinese version of PK, says he was surprised by the film's box office success
 ve kehete hai ki is baat se saaf pataa chalata he ki china main darshakon kii pasand badal rahi haih "darshak ab bharat jaisi nai jagahon main ruchi lene lage hai
 "perhaps this is the reason why he shot for his directorial debut Badi's in India in India
 2016 main relies hui is film ko joardaar safalataa mili thi or isane china main 700 karod ru
 Had earned ve bataate hai, "ab bharat main or bhi chini filmon kaa nirmaan hoga
 There are not only beautiful scenes here but also fantastic stories
 isse china ke logon ko bharat ke bare main or bhi adhik jaanane kaa mauka milegaa or log bharat aane ke liye aakarshith honge
 "despite the bitterness in political relations, interest in India has increased significantly in China
" china main bharat kii samskruti ke prati aakarshan bad gaya he
 This can be particularly seen in the 1970s when many years after 1962, the attraction towards Indian films increased even against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976)
 china kii khojabharatiya film udyog ke liye aamir khan kii safalataa ke kya myne hai
 This success has increased the attraction of the Indian film industry towards China, which until now had neglected the world's second largest box office
 bharat ke nirdeshak or vitarakon kaa ab tak yahi maananaa tha ki videshon main bhartiya filmon kii safalataa vahaan rah rahe bharatiyon kii jansankhya tak hi simit thi
 But Aamir has rejected this argument
 kya aamir kii safalataa kaa matlab he ki china main bollywood ko safalataa milegi
 His fans don't think so
 jing kahati hai, "dangal ko dekhne vaale zyaadaatar darshak aamir or unke abhinay ko pasand karte hai, na ki bhartiya filmon ke brands ke kaaran
 For example i am a fan of Andi Lau (hong Kong film star)
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki main honkong kii sabhi filmein pasand karti hum
 i can say based on my understanding and interaction with Aamir's fans that the audience personally likes Aamir
 ve apni filmon main samaaj kii samasyaon se khud ko jodate, apane desh se pyaar karte hai or hameshaa apane desh main sudhaar laana chaahate hai
 We like this thing
 ''lekin dangal kii safalataa lagata he, aaj bhi apana asar banaae hue he or uske kaaran bhartiya filmon ke prati aakarshan barkaraar he
 Bajrangi Bhaijaan, released in China on March 2, is showing in China two years after its release in India, yet it is making a big splash at the box office
 isane 23 march tak 2,530 aarambi (kareeb 260 karod ru
 )
 yah vahaan dangal or sikret superstar ke baad teesri sabase zyada kamai vaali film ban gai he
 Even before its success, director Kabir Khan has been taking interest in the Chinese film industry for a long time
 ve pichley saal china bhi gaye the taaki vahaan ek film kii yojana par kaam shuru kar saken
 He is the first major Indian director whose film will be the first of its kind in China
 ve kehete hai, "main ek aisi pariyojna par kaam kar rahaa hum jo bharat-china sahyog vaali film ho sakati he
 This story is also liked there and in a way it is officially supported
 isamen china kaa bhi ek kalakaar kaam karegaa or iskaa nirmaan china main kiya jayega
 "kabir believes that Indian sentiments have more impact in China than in Western countries:" i believe our sentiments work more in China than in the West
 hamaari samskritiyon main zyada samanthaayen hai
 Due to basic family values, gender equations and the entire social structure, we are more connected to each other
 ''varsh 2014 main bharat or china ne ab tak ke pehle sah-nirmaan ke samjhaute par dastakhat kiye the jiske kaaran china main zyada bhartiya filmein relies ho sakengi or china main varsh main 30 videshi filmon kii relies ke cote kaa asar un par nahin padegaa
 The agreement was a major change during President Jinping's visit that year, says Prasad Shetty, director of the China-based China Peacock Mountain Group
 ve kehete hai, "iskaa bada shrey china film beuro ko diya janaa chahie kyonki ve kuch alag kism kii filmein mangana chaahate the
 Shetty says that the success of "dangal" has proved to be a big change
 ve kehete hai, "china main dangal keval ek film bhar nahin he
 It has taken the form of an idea
 aap paaenge ki yahaan ke log is film ke sanvaadon kaa uddhran dene lage hai
 We saw that almost 60-year-old man who had not even seen a Chinese film in his life, was also lined up in front of the ticket window for this film
 ''china main vibo par soshal media main aamir ke folowaron kii sankhya das lakh se zyada ho chuki he
 He visits China once a year to meet his fans there
 isse utsahit hokar duusare sitare bhi is taraf dhyaan dena shuru karenge
 The first few films co-produced such as Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Yoga were a box office success in China but were not much preferred in India
 dangal kii safalataa dikhaati he ki film kii kahani kaa vishay jabaran thopa hua nahin hona chahie, balki vah swaabhaavik or sahaj laganaa chahie
 Shetty says, "we cannot spoil this new market
 hamen yahaan ke liye filmon kaa chunaav bahut soch-samajhakar karnaa chahie
 Dangal's success has not come from Tukke
 yah varshon ke kadam dar kadam vyavasthaagat prayaas kaa nateeja he
 When PK broke the record, people said that it was just a ruckus
 mujhe puraa yakeen tha ki aamir kii agali film bhi safal rahegi
 Even his fans in China will not deny this
 —saath mensuhani singh*** Actor Ajay Ghosh, who has impressed not only the audience with his strong villainy in the mill thriller 'visaranaya', will be seen in the role of a dreaded dacoit in 'bahubali - The Conclusion'
 ajay ne apane is kirdaar ke bare main baat karte hue bataaya, 'main daaku bandipotu viraiya kii bhoomika nibhaaoongaa

 unhone kaha, 'haalanki yah ek nakaaratmak kirdaar he, lekin logon ne ise dil se sweekaar kiya he
 When i got out after watching the first show of the film with my director, i was afraid that everybody would hate me, but it was the opposite
 mujhe khushi he ki unhen yah pasand aayaa
 "vissarayan", a somewhat Tamil novel based on the lock-up, raised the subject of police atrocities
 film main dinesh murugados, samuthirakani or kishor bhi mahatvapurn bhoomikaaon main hai
 The demand for Dhyan Chand, Kanshi Ram and Bhagat Singh to be honored today also increased amidst speculation that India's highest civilian honor 'bharat Ratna' was given to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 congress ne kaha ki agar sarkaar 'itihaas ke maarg' se ja rahi he to bharat ratna ke liye or bhi badi hastiyaan hai
 Senior Congress leader Manish Tiwari sought to consider the names of other great freedom fighters, including Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Lala Lajpat Rai for Bharat Ratna
 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'agar sarkaar bharat ratna ke liye aitihaasik raste par ja rahi he to use bhagat singh, raajaguru, sukhdev, lala lajpat raay
 
 ke naamon par bhi vichaar karnaa chahie
 ' tiwari ne apane twit main iene ke sansthaapakon raas bihari bose, general mohan singh, ani besent or e o hum tathaa gopal krishna gokhale kaa naam bhi sujhaayaa
 The former Union minister also reminded of litigation in the early 1990s over the award of the highest civilian award
 ek anya congress netaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki netaji ke saath basapa ke sansthaapak kanshi ram, aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke sansthaapak sar saiyad ahamed khan ko bhi bharat ratna se sammanit kiya janaa chahie
 He said that awards should be announced after the upcoming assembly elections in four states including Maharashtra and Haryana so that any politics can be avoided
 alvi ne kaha ki vah is mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likh rahe hai
 He said that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands should be named after Netaji, as he had given independence to many islands before the main earth got independence
 is bich, banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke sansthaapak pandit madan mohan malviya ke praputra evam elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish justise giridhar malviya ne bharat ratna ke liye malviya ke naam kii charchaa par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki vah aise shaks the jinhone 'itane saare kshetron main yogadan kiya

 Katju on Saturday reiterated his statement once again in Gaya district of Bihar that the press is not free in Bihar
 duusari ore bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar katju ke is bayaan par koi bhi pratikriya dene se batch rahe hai
 Here, after this statement, opposition parties have also intensified the attack on the government
 gaya main katju ne patrakaron se charchaa karte hue kaha ki bihar main press aaazaad nahin hai
 He said, 'it is a constitutional right for journalists to write news with freedom, but in Bihar the government harasses journalists when they write news independently
 ' idhar, bihar main media kii swatantraaa par pabandi ke katju ke bayaan par nitish ne koi pratikriya nahin di
 When the media persons questioned the Chief Minister who came to attend a function of Patna Medical College, he did not respond to this
 mukhyamantri ne kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Ramkripal Yadav said that Katju has brought the true picture of Bihar to the country
 sarkaar kaa asli cheharaa saamne aa gaya he
 Here, when the state Health Minister Ashwini Choubey was asked on this matter, he said that journalists are the fourth pillar of democracy, and only the public and journalists will do this analysis
 ullekhneey he ki patna main shuukravaar ko ek samaroh main bolte hue katju ne kaha tha, 'mujhe jo jaankaree mili he vah press ke liye acchhee nahin he
 If someone here writes against a government or a government official, he is harassed
 unhone kaha ki lalu ke shashan kaal se bihar main vidhi-vyavastha kii sthiti main sudhaar jarur hua he lekin press kii aazaadee kam ho gai he
 He said that the press worked freely during Lalu's reign
 unhone kaha ki bihar main agar koi patrkaar sarkaar ke khilaaf kuch likhata he to sambandhit samachar patr ke maalikon par dabaav banaakar us patrkaar ko naukari se nikalava diya ja rahaa he yaa use tang karne kii niyat se uskaa sthanantaran karvaa diya ja rahaa he
 With their strongest fast bowling attack, Australia landed in the Champions Trophy on the basis of the 'creepy Quartet' of Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and James Pattinson in their first match against New Zealand on Friday
 Will do
 in donon tiimon ke paas preranadai captain hai
 Australia relies heavily on Steve Smith and New Zealand on Kane Williamson
 donon tiimon main kuch upyogi khilaadi shaamil hai jo akele dam par kisi match kaa pasa palat sakate hai lekin agar tej gendbaaji akraman kii baat karen to usamen austrailia kaa palada thodaa baari lagata he
 However, the decision to field four fast bowlers will not be easy for Australia, as they have often struggled with injuries and there has been a short time when they have all been fit
 lekin uske paas jaan hestings ke rup main ek or upyogi tej gendbaaj he jo ki england kii paristhitiyon se acchhee tarah waakif hai
 The comments aise main australia chaar tej gendbaajon ke saath utarane kaa jokhim uthaa saktaa he
 It is a relief for the Australian team that Cummins, who was troubled by back pain for most of his career, is fit again
 is 24 varshiya gendbaaj ne 2011 main antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan kiya tha lekin uske baad vah teen test or 28 vanade match hi khel paae hai
 Left-arm fast bowler Stark has recovered from a foot injury, due to which he returned from the middle of the India tour
 patinson bhi peeth dard se ubar gayi hai
 The pair of Hazelwood, Cummins, Stark and Pattinson expect Australia to have the same success as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Craft and Joel Garner in the 1970s
 martin guptil, captain williamson or alrounder kore anderson kii shandaar pariyon se newjiland ne srilanka ke 357 ran ke lakshya ko lagbhag 46 overon main hasil kar diya tha
 New Zealand's main tenor rests on Williamson and Anderson as Guptill and Ross Taylor have consistently failed to perform the same
 australia kii ballebaaji bhi newjiland kii tulana main majboot dikhti he jisamen david warner or captain smith jaise do dhurandhar ballebaaj shaamil hai
 Aaron Finch, who scored a century in a practice match against Sri Lanka, has the potential to destroy any attack when he is in form
 inke alaava kris lin ne haal main samaapt hue ipel main apane visphotak tewaron se avgat karaayaa jabaki madhyakram main glen maxwell jaisaa tejatarraar ballebaaj he
 The New Zealand team relies on its main fast bowlers Tim Southee and Trent Boult
 adam milne or colin di grandehome uski tej gendbaaji kii chaukadi ko puraa karte hai lekin unhen australian akraman kii tarah khaufnak nahin mana ja saktaa he
 All-rounders like Anderson and James Neesham balance the team
 newjiland haalanki 2015 worldcup ke lig charan main oakland main australia par darj kii gayi jeet se prerana lenaa chahega
 Australia, however, avenged it in the final played in Melbourne
 in donon maichon main khilne vaale kai khilaadi kal phir se aamane saamne honge
 In such a situation, Australia can afford to land with four fast bowlers
it is a relief for the australian team ke liye yah raahat kii baat he ki apane kariyar main adhiktar samay peeth dard ke kaaran pareshaan rahe camins phir se feet hai
 The 24-year-old bowler made his international debut in 2011, but has played only three Tests and 28 odis since then
 baayen haath kaa tej gendbaaj stark paanv kii chot se ubar gaye hai jiske kaaran vah bharat daure ke bich se laut gayi the
 Pattinson has also recovered from back pain
 hejalwood, camins, stark or patinson kii jodi se australia ko usee tarah kii safalataa kii ummid he jaise 1970 ke dashak main endi rabarts, maaikel holding, colin craft or joel garnor ne westeindies ko dilaayi thi
 New Zealand achieved Sri Lanka's target of 357 runs in 46 overs with superb innings from Martin Guptill, captain Williamson and all-rounder Corey Anderson
 newjiland kaa mukhya daaromadar williamson or anderson par tikaa he kyonki guptil or rose tailor nirantar ek jaisaa pradarshan karne main naakaam rahe hai
 Australia's batting also looks stronger than that of New Zealand which includes two batsmen like David Warner and Captain Smith
 srilanka ke khilaaf abhyaas match main shatak jadne vaale aaron finch jab farm main hote hai to kisi bhi tarah ke akraman kii dhajjiyaan udaane kaa madda rakhte hai
 Apart from these, Chris Lynn revealed his explosive attitude in the recently concluded IPL, while in the middle order is a flamboyant batsman like Glenn Maxwell
 newjiland team apane mukhya tej gendbaajon tim southi or trent bolt par nirbhar he
 Adam Milne and Colin de Grandhom complete his fast bowling quartet but cannot be considered as dreadful as an Australian attack
 anderson or james nisham jaise alrounder team main santulan paidaa karte hai
 New Zealand, however, would like to draw inspiration from the win over Australia in Auckland in the 2015 World Cup league stage
 australia ne haalanki tab melbern main khele gayi final main iskaa badla chuktaa kar diya tha
 Many players who play these two matches will be face to face again tomorrow
 martin guptil, captain williamson or alrounder kore anderson kii shandaar pariyon se newjiland ne srilanka ke 357 ran ke lakshya ko lagbhag 46 overon main hasil kar diya tha
 New Zealand's main tenor rests on Williamson and Anderson as Guptill and Ross Taylor have consistently failed to perform the same

 aksar lambii duuri ke rail safar ke dauraan logon ko kuch aisi gharelu chizon kii jarurat hoti he jo chalati train main milanaa mushkil hota he
 But to overcome your complaint, the Indian Railways has made a special plan
 iske tahat aapako safar ke dauraan ghar or rasoi ke item samet anya jaruri saamaan mil sakenge
 This special facility is likely to debut in the new year
 ek varisht railway adhikari ke mutabik pehle charan main is suvidha kii shuruyaat do trainon main hogi or iske baad har charan main do-do trainon ko joda jayega
 For this, a private firm has been given a five-year contract
 is form ke paas gharelu saamaan ke alaava beauty product samet anya items bechney kaa license hoga
 However, the firm will not be allowed to sell any food items, cigarettes, gutkha or liquor in trains
 yah form pashchim railway ke mumbai divijan ke 16 mail or express trainon main apane products bech sakegi
 The official said that these items can be sold only from eight in the morning to nine in the night and two employees in uniform will bear this responsibility
 ahm baat ye he ki wo yatri bhi safar ke dauraan saamaan kharid sakenge jinke paas cash uplabdh nahin hoga
 Actually, such passengers will be given the facility to buy goods by debit and credit card

 Of course, the Sultanate has been plundered in both countries, but Baghdadi's executioners are still issuing ludicrous decrees under their rule
 bagdadi ne ab ek nayaa fakhmaan jari kiya he
 Decree the eyes of women should not be visible from behind this mask
 yadi galati se bhi ankhen dikh gayi ankhen phod di jaaengi
 Abu Bakr, who has declared himself to be Khalifa at gunpoint, can bid for women under the rule of Al Baghdadi
 unhen gulam bhi bana sakate hai
 But women are not allowed to see the world with open eyes under the rule of Baghdadi
 ji haa, aapane sahi suna
 In the reign of Baghdadi, now the sight of women is also called Haram
 yahaan auraton par pehle hi sau paabandiyaan hai
 For example, they are neither allowed to walk out of the burqa nor with open arms and legs
 yahaan tak ki oongliyaan chhipaane ke liye bhi unhen hameshaa dastaane or jurab pahanane padate hai
 But now the new order issued by ISIS for women is similar to this
 yun bhi chaahe mard ho yaa aurat iesas ke kabze vaale ilaake main use apni marzi se jeene kii azaadi nahin he
 But now for women, this place is worse than Jahannam
 sir se paanv tak kaale kapade se dhanki auraton ko ab apni ankhon ko bhi ek jaali lagi kaali pattee se dhankna hoga
 If not done, you will be disappointed
 bagdadi ko khud ke kal kaa bharosa nahin magar wo yahaan kii mahilaon kaa aaj barbaad karne par amada he
 New decrees are being issued for them everyday
 laudspikar or parchon ke zarie aatanki ghar ghar main mahilaon ke liye nae niyam kanoon kii jaankaree de rahe hai
 By the way, the order of the eye is only one part of the craze of Baghdadi
 asal main farmaanon kii fehrist bahut lambii he
 According to this, women here
 bina burke ke baahar nahin nikal saktin
 Gloves in the hands and socks in the feet are also important
 yadi koi mahila bagdadi ke in niyam kaayadon ko todatii hui pai jaati he to uski sazaa kya he
 According to the information, if the Baghdadi police catch any woman violating the dress code, then a notice comes on the ID of her husband or father
 ye notice hoti haiaatankki adaalat kii, jahaan vakil bheebagadadike hote hai or daleel bhi
 Overall, the punishment is so painful that no woman is seen making such a mistake again

 Fear of cancer is still very much all over the world
 yahi vajah he ki cancer par lagaataar shodh ho rahe hai
 According to the latest news, scientists have claimed to have detected brain cancer about five years ago
 ek study ke mutabik ek khaas blad test ab brain cancer ko uske lakshan ubhar kar saamne aane se takreeban paanch saal pehle bataa degaa
 According to principal researcher Judith Schwartzboum of the Ohio State University in the US, interactions between protein particles that carry information to immune cells begin to decrease approximately five years before cancer is detected in brain cancer patients
 shwarthjabom ke mutabik vahi jaankaree ek din brain cancer ke agrim ilaaj main madadgaar sabit hogi
 This study has appeared in PLOS ONE, a journal focused on glioma
 bataaya jaataa he ki sabase saamaanya prakaar ke glioma ke liye ausatan jivit rahane kaa samay 14 maheene he
 Its symptoms vary
 isamen sar dard, memory los, persenality change, dhundhala dikhaai dena or bolne main kathinaayee shaamil he
 On average, cancer is detected when more than three months have passed since the onset of symptoms, tumors develop greatly
 shwarthjabom ne kaha, "agar ham adhik prabhavi dhang se ilaaj kii ummid karte hai, to tumor ke vikaas ke shuruaati charan main hi uski pahchaan karnaa mahatvapurn he
 If you understand those initial steps, then you can design treatments to prevent further tumor growth
 "test kii jaankaree dete hue shwarthjabom ne yah bhi kaha ki haalanki is durlabh tumor ke lakshanon ke bina logon kaa vyapak blad test avyavhaarik hoga
 With the help of this research, we can develop technology that can detect brain cancer first and pave the way for more effective treatment
 shwarthjabom ne 974 logon ke rakt ke namoonay kaa moolyankan kiya, uname se aadhe logon ne blad sample liye jane ke baad ke saalon membrain cancer kaa ilaajakaraayaa
 Schwartzbaum was interested in the role of cytokines
 aapako bataa den ki cytokins hi vah protein he jo pratiraksha koshikaon (immune cells) ke saath pratiraksha ke liye sandesh detaa he
 Schwartzbaum evaluated 277 cytokines in blood samples
 or paaya ki jin logon kocancerhua unke khun main cytokins kaa sampark (interection) kam tha
 Giving information about this, Schwartzbaum said, "in those people who developed brain cancer, the interaction was clearly weak
 yah sambhav he ki tumor ke vikaas main yah bhi kisi tarah kii bhoomika nibhaataa ho
 The activity of cytokine in cancer is particularly important to understand
 kyonki yah tumor ke vikaas se ladane ke maamle main ek acchhee bhoomika nibhaa sakati he, lekin yah ek khalanaayak ke role main bhi dikh sakati he kyonki yah pratiraksha pranali (immune system) ko dabaakar tumor ke vikaas main madad kar sakati he

 com / b0uzkj4uup— Saregama (@saregamaglobal) June 13, 2018 This film by Deol Tigri is the third film of the Yamla Pagla Deewana series
 film se dharmendra or unke bete sani or bobi deol phir se dhamal machaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Salman is very respectful of actor Dharmendra and hence is making every effort to promote the film on his behalf
 alpsankhk netaaon kii talash main tallent huntpurvanchal ke 40 jilon se isaki shuruyatgauf main muslim siyasat majboot kar rahi party Another truth of Pakistan, which is considered to be a terror factory
 pakistan wo desh he, jo aatankwaad ko khaad-pani dene ke saath aatankiyon ko panaah detaa he, training detaa he
 The terrorists sitting in Pakistan do not take any time to kill the terrorists who do not act in Kashmir
 dakshin kashmir main kareeb teen maheene pehle bhartiya suraksha balon nekhoonkhaar aatankior lashkar-e-taiyaba ke purv commander abu dujana ko maar giraaya tha
 Such an eight-minute audio has surfaced on social media, in which Dujana can be heard talking on the phone with Ansar gajawat-ul-hind kingpin Zakir Musa
 bataa den ki dujana nailashkaramen apni andekhi ke baad musa se haath mila liya tha
 It can be heard in the phone recording how Dujana had lost confidence in Pakistan
 recording main musa ko dujana bataata he ki kis tarah usase kisi khaas aatanki kii lokation maangi jaati, phir us aatanki ko jaldi hi maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa
 a senior official told India Today, "the situation has changed with the killing of top terrorists
 aisi kai koshishen kii ja chuki hai jisase ki lashkar, hijbul mujahidin ke nae hybrid modules banaae ja saken or paak adhikrut kashmir (POK) se hi niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 The officer also said that Moses challenged this control
 isi vajah se usne apni jaan par doharaa khatra mol le liya, suraksha balon ke haathon maare jane kaa yaa phir aatank ke aakaaon kii ore se maut ke ghat utaar die jane kaa
 Dujana can also be heard in the audio saying how his commanders across the border are insisting on him openly condemning Moses, the former commander of Hizbul
 bataa den ki pakistani aatanki dujana lambey samay se sakriy aatankiyon main se ek rahaa or kai baar suraksha balon ko chakma de kar bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa
 Then he joined hands with Zakir Musa's terrorist organization Ansar gajawat-ul-hind
 is sanghathan ko al kaayda kaa sahyogi mana jaataa he
 In the audio, Dujana can also be heard saying to Zakir Musa, 'they are asking me to release the audio against you (zakir Musa), in which i can say that you are doing Fitna (peace) in Kashmir and i am with you i am not connected in any way
 ’ dujana audio main ye bhi kah rahaa he, ‘wo kah rahe hai ki tumne abbaas kaa suraag diya tha jo muthbhed main maaraa gaya tha
 'terrorist Abbas was killed in an encounter in Kakapora
 suraksha balon ko jin aatankiyon kii talash he unamem jakir musa kaa naam sabase upar he
 In the audio, it is also being said to Musa on behalf of Dujana that the Pak 'parvar' are asking him for the right location of you (musa)
 dujana pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaaon ke liye ye bhi kah rahaa he ki wo kashmir main apni baat nahin maanane vaale aatankiyon ko marava rahe hai
 Dujana can be heard saying, 'it is true that they (pakistan) are asking me about the pinpoint location but i did not tell
 ’bataa den ki abu dujana pulavama main 1 agast ko apane ek saathi ke saath muthbhed main maaraa gaya tha
 This audio is from some time before that
 haalanki ye saaf nahin hua ki ye audio thik kis taarikh kaa he
 According to security forces sources, this is a case of internal confrontation between terrorist organizations
 dujana jis muthbhed main maaraa gaya tha wo jammu-kashmir police ko mili kuch khaas inputs ke baad hui thi
 The efforts of the Indian Army to surrender the Dujana could not yield any result

 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to win a landslide victory in these states with more than 50 percent votes
 iske alaava in teenon rajyon kii satta par bijepi kaa kabja he, aise main uske paas paane se kahin zyada apane raajnneetik aadhaar ko bachaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 a strategy has been made for the Maharashtra and Maharashtra Assembly elections
 bijepi apni sahyogi shivasena ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main utarane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the congress-ncp had completely failed in front of the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 bijepi 27
 23 seats and Shiv Sena 23 with 6 percent votes
 29 fisadi maton ke saath 18 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In this way, bjp-shiv Sena won 41 seats and 50 out of total 48 seats in Maharashtra
 89 fisadi vot hasil kiye
 Whereas, both BJP and Shiv Sena contested separate elections in Maharashtra's 2014 assembly elections
 iske baavjood bijepi 122 seat ke saath 27
 Shiv Sena 19 with 8 per cent votes and 63 seats
 3 fisadi vot hasil kiye the
 In this way, both parties received 47 percent of the vote
 jabaki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-shivasena ne apana graph badhaate hue 50 fisadi se zyada vot ke aankade ko paar kar liya he
 In such a situation, it will be a big challenge for the bjp-shiv Sena alliance to keep their vote bank intact
 aisa karne main yadi yah gathbandhan safal rahata he to congress-ensipi ke liye satta main vaapasi kar paanaa mushkil hoga
 Preparations for assembly elections have started in Jharkhand Jharkhand

 BJP 51 in Lok Sabha elections

 Won 1 seat with 33 percent votes
 is tarah se bijepi gathbandhan ko kul 55
 53 percent votes were received
 jabaki, paanch saal pehle hue jharkhand ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 37 siton ke saath 31
 3 per cent of the vote and 3 with his associate AJSU mlas
 7 fisadi vot mili the
 In this way, the total vote of both parties was 35 percent
 jabaki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main puraa vipaksh ekajute hokar maidan main utraa tha
 Despite this, BJP has gained 20 percent more than the vote it got in the assembly elections
 aise hi voting pattern rahaa to bijepi gathbandhan ko maat dena vipaksh ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Haryana, which is the battleground of India, has started laying political ballot for the assembly elections in Haryana
 aise main haal hi main hue loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey bijepi ko utsahit karne vaale hai
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP managed to win all 10 seats with a clean sweep of 58 per cent votes
 bijepi haryana 2014 vidhansabha chunaav main 47 siton ke saath 33
 She was elected for the first time in power by securing 2 votes
 aise main agar 2014 ke vidhansabha ke vot ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mili voton se tulana karen to bijepi ko kareeb 25 fisadi kaa phayda hua he
 In this way, if the BJP is able to retain 58 per cent of the votes received in the Lok Sabha in this year's assembly elections, then it is difficult to shake off the power

 Yesterday we told you that a drunk teenager started having sex with a trolley serving drinks

 After a few pegs, the screw of things got stuck somewhere and there was a heated debate between the two
 ye jald hi hathapayee main tabdeel ho gai
 And in such a situation, Brad overshadowed his stepfather at the age of 58
 unhone denevar kii chaddhi ko peeche se pakadaa or ek jatke main upar tak khinch kar gardan par kas diya
 In a few seconds, Denver died of suffocation

 CNN has been quoted by a trusted source of the Democratic Party, as reported by the news agency 'DPA' that Obama proposed to accept the position of foreign minister before him during a meeting with Hillary in Chicago on Thursday
 baharhaal shuukravaar ko hillari ne obama prashasan main koi pad sweekaar karne ke bare main lag rahi atakalon kaa khandan karne se inkaar kar diya
 In a meeting in New York, Hillary said she did not want to speculate about Obama's administration and that any questions should be asked to Obama's power transfer team

 Sources associated with the Ministry of Defense said that 65-year-old Subedar Ramkishan Grewal, who allegedly committed suicide after not receiving the enhanced pension as promised by the One Rank One Pension Scheme, is feared to have committed suicide
 sutron kaa kahana he ki jin paristhitiyon main maut hui, uski jaanch jaruri he
 The source said that it needs to be ascertained who was with him during the alleged suicide by Grewal
 kisne unhen jehar uplabdh karaayaa or "kya kisi ne unki maansik pareshaani kaa laabh itnaa bada kadam uthavane ke liye kiya
 " mangalvaar ko maut se pehle, mritak greval ne antim baar phone apane bete jaswant greval ko kiya tha
 The phone call was recorded by his son Jaswant in which he was saying, "I have eaten poison, i am in Jawahar Bhavan
 " tippaniyan Describing his suicide as a "sacrifice for his soldiers and country," he is also saying, "whatever is happening is sad
" javaanon ko nyaay nahin mila he
 " vahiin, purv sainik greval ke parijanon ne daawa kiya he ki ve raksha mantri manohar parrikar se pension badhwane ke silsile main milanaa chaahate the
 Sources, however, say that the ministry has not yet received any request regarding the appointment "nor has anything said in this letter"
 sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki is maamle ko hal kiya ja saktaa tha kyonki raksha mantri vishmataaon ko dur karne nijee taur par prayasarat the
 Sources said that the One Rank One Pension Scheme of the ex-servicemen was not stopped but the problem was from the bank
 apni khudakushi ko "apane javaanon or desh ke liye balidaan" qaraar dete hue, vah yah bhi kah rahe hai, "jo bhi kuch ho rahaa he, vah dukhad he
 The soldiers have not got justice
 " At the same time, the family of ex-serviceman Grewal has claimed that he wanted to meet Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar in connection with raising the pension
 haalanki sutron kaa kahana he ki mantralay ko abhi tak appointment ke sambandh main koi anurodh nahin mila "na hi unka patr main is sambandh main kuch kaha gaya he"
 Sources also said that the matter could have been resolved as the Defense Minister was personally trying to resolve the disparities
 sutron ne bataaya ki purvasainik kii van rank van pension skim ko roka nahin gaya tha balki samasya bank kii ore se thi

 patil kaa kahana he ki maharashtra kii sabase badi dharmik yatra ke dauraan logon se judane or suraksha sambandhi baarikiyaan jaanane kaa ye ek kargar tarika he

 Senior officials have spoken of cycling daily for their health in the coming days

 peeth ne board ke adhikariyon se jaananaa chaha ki jo shraddhalu gupha tak kii duuri paidal nahin tay kar sakate, unhen vahaan helicopter se kyon nahin pahunchaaya jaataa
 The official said that about one thousand people can be landed about four kilometers away from the cave but after that they will have to walk on foot
 rohtagi ne kaha tha ki rojaanaa 15 hajaar shraddhalu gupha main darshan ke liye aate hai or adhikaran ne is tarah ke pratibandh lagaakar galati kii he
 The bench questioned senior advocate Krishna Venugopal on behalf of the petitioner Gauri Mulekhi as to why the application in this case could not be properly filed

 is maamle main microsoft, toronto sthit ai4ai ink dwaara hasil kiye gaye patent ke ulanghan kaa 2009 main doshi paaya gaya tha or use kshatipurti ke rup main 29 karod dollar ke bhugtan kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 According to legal experts, the decision of the Supreme Court will decide how patent laws will protect particular technology
 canadai company ne microsoft ke khilaaf 2007 main 'verde' anuprayog par apane patent ke ulanghan ko lekar adaalat main chunauti di thi or us maamle main uski jeet hui thi tathaa disambar, 2009 main use 29 karod dollar kii kshatipurti bhi mili thi
 In its petition in a Texas court, I4I claimed that a patent it acquired in 1998 had been encroached upon by the Microsoft company
 yah patent ai4ai kii praudyogiki se sambandhit he, jo exmel computer programing bhashaa ke upyog ke jariye dastavejon ko khol saktaa he or jatil aankadon ko electonic dastavejon main badal saktaa he
 This technology allows consumers to manage complex information by converting complex documents into more accessible databases
 baad main 2009 main america apili adaalat ne bhi nichali adaalat ke us faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa, jiske tahat 11 janvari se microsoft par verde processing software kii bikri par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 In May last year, the Canadian company had another breakthrough when the US Patent and Trademark Office rejected Microsoft's request and confirmed that I4I Inc
 held the patent for the application
 lekin microsoft ne pichley varsh agast main is faisle ko america sarvocch nyaayalay main chunauti di or kaha ki maujuuda pranali patent dharak kii ore adhik jhuki hui he
 This means that the US patent system may change radically in this case

 It was in the india-australia series that Virat Kohli's team failed to use the DRS properly
 aakiri kya vajah he ki australian team nai takanic kaa sahi istemaal kar rahi he or viraat kohli ab bhi is ko samajhane kii koshish main lage hai
 The secret was revealed after the victory in the Bengaluru Test
 test ke chauthe din steven smith ke out hone ke baad viraat or smith ulajhate dikhe, ampire ne bich bachaav kiya or match jari rahaa
 After the match, Virat told that Smith was asking the support staff sitting in the dressing room in gestures whether to take DRS or not to take DRS
 viraat ne kaha, 'jab wo mude to ampire ko samaj main aa gaya ki kya chal rahaa he
 We had also noticed this before and informed the match referee and the umpire
 australian team pichley teen dinon se ye kar rahi he or unhen rokna zaruri tha
 Sledding and playing against opponents is different but there is a line inside the cricket field that you cannot cross
 main yahaan us shabd kaa istemaal nahin karugaan lekin ye vahi he
 i cannot do this in the cricket field
 ' After this, when a reporter used the word cheating, Virat immediately replied, "this is not me, you are doing it
" ' kohli ke mutabik pehle bhi unhone australian cricketron ko aisa karte dekha tha
 'when i was batting, i saw Australian players doing it twice
 maine ampiron ko kaha or isi vajah se ampire smith ke out hone ke baad unke peeche khadey rahe
 ' smith ne match ke baad apni galati maani lekin dabi jubaan main or kaha ki wo brain fed kaa shikaar ho gaye
 'the ball hit the pad and when i looked at Peter, he said look at the other side
 jab main muda to brain fed ho gaya
 i shouldn't have done that
 main ladakon kii taraf dekh rahaa tha, mujhe aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Comments kohli ne smith kii safaai ko qabool nahin kiya
 'to be honest, if someone makes a mistake while batting, it will be a brain fad for me
 jaisaa pune test main mere saath hua or main bold ho gaya lekin jo teen din se chal rahaa ho use brain fed nahin kahenge
 ' smith ne kohli ke saath hui sledging par chuppi nahin todi or kaha, 'main or viraat bas baaten kar rahe the
 There is no need to see much of it
 ham mazaa kar rahe the or dostana ladaai kahi ja sakati he jo cricket main hota he
 ' viraat ne kaha, 'jab wo mude to ampire ko samaj main aa gaya ki kya chal rahaa he

 According to Kohli, earlier he had seen Australian cricketers doing this
 'jab main ballebaazi kar rahaa tha tab maine do baar australian khilaadiyon ko aisa karte dekha
 i told the umpires and that is why the umpires stood behind Smith after he was dismissed
 ' Smith admitted his mistake after the match, but stubbornly said that he had fallen prey to brain fade
 'gend pad par lagi or maine peter kii taraf dekha to usne kaha duusari taraf dekho
 When i turned, the brain faded
 mujhe aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 i was looking at the boys, i shouldn't have done that
 'tippaniyan Kohli did not accept Smith's cleanliness
 'eemaandaaree se kahuun to agar koi ballebaazi karte hue galati karata he to mere liye brain fed hoga
 As happened with me in Pune Test and i got bold but what has been going on for three days will not be called as Brain Fade
 ' Smith did not break the silence on the sledding that happened to Kohli and said, 'I and Virat were just talking
 isamen zyaada kuch dekhne kii zarurat nahin he
 We were having fun and what could be called friendly fighting happens in cricket

 kisi kii baton ko ghumana or galat samajhnaa, ye wo he jo aap us vyakti kii baton se samajhnaa chaahate hai, yah us vyakti par parchaai nahin he jo vah kahata he, lekin aap par he
 "" So contemplate yourself and see who you are and hopefully you will get a job
 "guys please calm down
 
 and get a life
 Twisting, misinterpreting and understanding what you want from what someone has to say is not a reflection on the person who says it but on you
 So self reflect and see who you are and hopefully get a job
