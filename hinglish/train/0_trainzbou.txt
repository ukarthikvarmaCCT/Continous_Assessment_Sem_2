 mangal kii sataha par khaaraa jal kuch khaas paristhitiyon main maujuud ho saktaa he, lekin yah jivan ke liye sahyog nahin karegaa
 These data are indicated by data collected from the red planet by nasa's Curiosity Rover
 yah nateeja kareeb do saal ke mausam data par aadhaarit he, jise grah ke vishuvatiya kshetra ke paas ek gadde se ekatra kiya gaya tha
 Vincent Chevrier, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas' Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, said that under certain circumstances, a few hours per day, you may have the right conditions to create liquid saline water on the surface of Mars
 khaare jal kii maujuudagi mars arbitor dwaara kiye gaye sthiti ke avlokan kaa byoraa de sakati he, jise dhalaan par gahari rekhaaen kaha jaataa he or yah grah ke garm mausam ke dauraan badhata he
 However, Chevrier believes that circumstances on Mars are difficult enough to support in life
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi ham khaaraa jal banane ke thermodynamiks ke avlokan ko or bhookshetreey jeevon ko jod kar dekhen to kya mangal ke khaare jal main jeevon ke liye ek sambhaavna talashna mumkin he
 'mars is cold, extremely dry and has 200 times lower atmospheric pressure than Earth

 Thursday is very important in Hinduism
 kyonki guuruuvaar kaa din sabhi devi-devataaon ke guru brahaspati kaa din hota he, saath hi nau grahon main sabase bade grah kaa din hota he
 Lord Vishnu is worshiped on Thursday
 itnaa hi nahin is din vidhi-vidhaan ke saath puja karne se guru grah bhi shant rahata he
 These thousand names of Shri Hari will not make every desire cut, do not shaving According to the scriptures, the planet Jupiter is considered life i
e
 your age
 agar aap is din ye donon kam karenge to aapkaa brihaspati grah kamjor hoga
 Due to which there will be many difficulties in your life
 saath hi aapaki umr bhi kam ho jaaegi
 When God incurred sins on earth then these incarnations should not be washed by women according to their scriptures that women should not wash their hair on this day, because Jupiter is the factor of husband in women's horoscope
 saath hi santan kaa bhi kaarak hota he
 Due to which the planet Jupiter is weakened by washing hair on this day
 jisase shubh kaam hone main aadchan or hameshaa beemaari bani rahati he
 Therefore, hair should not be cut on this day, which has an impact on the life of children and husband
 unki unnati baadhit hoti he
 Do not do these things related to the fruit house by chanting the thousand names of Lord Vishnu with this mantra, just like doing the work related to our body, Jupiter planet will have more effect on your Jupiter planet in the same way washing clothes, mopping, getting out of junk etc
 is
 vaastu ke anusaar mana jaataa he ki hamaare ghar kii disha ishan kone jiskaa guru brihaspati grah hota he
 Also, this direction is related to the children of the family, education and religion
 isliye ye kaam nahin karnaa chahie
 Otherwise, your child, education and religion have inauspicious effects

 Thackeray said, 'once the Prime Minister comes to this holy place, all his sins will be washed away
 ' thakare ne aage kaha, 'modi sarkaar ne army ke javaanon kaa vetan nahin badhaayaa lekin rafeljaise bhrasht saude karne main jaraa bhi hichak nahin

 Hindus are innocent but not fools
 Let there be a discussion in Parliament on the Ram temple issue, who are in your favour on this issue among NDA will be clear
 - ANI (@ANI) December 24, 2018 Taking a dig at the bjp's defeat in the recent assembly elections, Thackeray said that the defeat in the states is a sign that national parties will no longer work there

 During this time, Thackeray also said that 'you know that the watchman is also involved in the theft these days
 'thakare ne kaha, bijepi ne masjid todi or satta praapt kar lee lekin aage ab kuch nahin ho rahaa
 You acquitted yourself in Sohrabuddincase but the issue of Babri Masjid is still hanging

 Nitish has talked about the Union of Free India, even after that the alliance continues
 thakrene aage kaha, 'main maharashtra ke logon se apil karnaa chahta hum ki ve shivasena ko satta main laaen, ham pradesh kii sabhi pareshaaniyon kaa hal kar denge

 iske liye bipasha karan ke liye kaam bhi dhund rahi hai
 It is being told that Bipasha is constantly making recommendations to the producer and director to get Karan to work, because even though Karan's previous film 'hate Story-3' has become a hit, he is not getting any film offers
 Huh
 tippaniyan According to sources, even if an offer of a film comes to Bipasha, Bipasha still asks about the hero of that film
 agar us film main kisi hero kii casting nahin hui he tab wo nirmaataa nirdeshak se karan ko cast karne ke liye kahati hai
 Significantly, during the 2015 film 'alone', Bipasha and Karan met and they became friends
 film kii relies ke baad donon ke ishk ke charche shuru ho gaye, kyonki aksar desh-videsh main joda saath ghumta phirata najar aayaa
 Now that their relationship is so strong or moving forward, then Bipasha is bound to worry

 The comments sutron ke anusaar agar bipasha ke paas kisi film kaa ofer aata he tab bhi bipasha us film ke hero ke bare main puuchhati hai
 If there is no casting of a hero in that film, then she asks the producer director to cast Karan
 gauratlab he ki 2015 kii film 'alon' ke samay bipasha or karan mili or inaki dosti hui
 After the release of the film, both of their love affair started, as the couple often roamed around the country and abroad

 The attack on the CRPF convoy on 14 February was a failure of the intelligence agency
 ye baat siarpief kii aantarik report main kahi gai he
 40 CRPF personnel were killed in this attack
 yah report grih mantralay ke bayaan ke vipareet he
 According to the Home Ministry, the Pulwama terror attack was not a failure of the intelligence agency

 The report stated that such input was not shared by any intelligence agency in the valley

 CRPF said in its statement, "internal print reports of CRPF related to Pulwama incident are going on in print and electronic media

 14 farvari ko siarpief ke kafile main 78 vaahan shaamil the or 2547 yatriyon ke saath jammu se srinagar ke liye ravaanaa hue the
 Sources said that the convoy was easy to identify from a distance and information also leaked easily

 Investigations revealed that an unusually tall convoy was also the cause

 3 pm 30 baje ke kareeb siarpief kii bas HR 49F 0637 of 76 par aatmghaatee hamalaa hua
 This bus was at number 5 in the convoy
 sutron ne kaha ki hamale ke baad, haalanki maanak sanchaalan prakriya (esaopi) kaa paalan kiya gaya
 According to the rule, there should be a long distance between every 4 trains
 iskaa paalan kiya gaya tha or isi vajah se iskaa asar sirf ek gaadi par hua
 Investigation revealed that a video was found from the crpf's bunker vehicle which showed that aisai Ram Lal had tried to stop the suicide bomber's vehicle while on ROP duty

 However, DG RR Bhatnagar said that the report had not reached his table

 The current situation in the valley has further delayed the final report, as officials have been tasked to maintain law and order in the valley
 narendra modi sarkaar apane kaarykaal kaa chauthaa saal puraa kar rahi he or kachche tel kii badhati keemton ne uske achche dinon ke sapanom ko you-turn de diya he
 During the last four years, where crude oil prices have helped the Modi government's revenue sector the most
 ab petrol or dijal kii lagaataar badhati keemton se saaf ho gaya he ki aam aadmi kii jeb par baari padane ke saath-saath petrol-dijal kii keemten ab donon kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaar kaa arth-ganit bigaad sakati he
 Before the tenure of the Modi government, the common man in the Manmohan Singh government was suffering from inflation
 jahaan vaishvik bazaar main kaccha tel sheersh str par bik rahaa tha vahiin desh main 2013 ke dauraan petrol-dijal kii keemten sarkaar kaa ganit kharaab kar rahi thim
 The first is the rising inflation from expensive petrol and diesel and the second is the rising government spending and expensive government revenue from expensive crude oil
 ise padhein: GDP se mahangaai tak arthvyavastha ke in paimaanon par kitna khare utre modilihaaja, 2014 ke aam chunaavon main mahangaai or petrol-dijal kii keemten ek bada mudda bana
 Narendra Modi, who is claiming the prime minister's post, promised in his publicity rallies that a good day brought by him would be cheap petrol and diesel
 kyon nahin sasta hua petrol or dijalmai 2014 main modi sarkaar banane ke saath hi duniyabar main kachche tel kii keemton main baari giravat darj hone lagi
 Amid this decline, all those countries which depended on imports for crude oil and also large consumers of crude oil started benefiting from it
 lekin chunaavon main vaada karne ke baavjood modi sarkaar ne kachche tel kii keemton main vaishvik giravat kaa sidhaa phayda upabhokta tak pahunchane se rokane ke liye desh main petrol-dijal kii bikri par bada tex lagaate hue sarkaar kii aamadani ko boost dene kaa faisla kiya

 24 Taking advantage of this slippage in the prices of crude oil, the central government increased the exide duty on petrol and diesel
 jahaan prati litre petrol par 21
 Exide duty was charged at Rs 50, while the government paid 17 per liter of diesel
 30 rupee bataur duty vasula
 Due to this, the Central Government's earnings from the sale of petrol and diesel doubled
 jahaan vitt varsh 2014 main kendra sarkaar ko petrol-dijal par tex se kamai jidipi kaa mahaj 0
 7 per cent while doubling to 1 in FY 2017
 6 fisadi ho gai
 As a result, the decision of the Central Government did not reduce the prices of petrol diesel for the common man
 ise padhein: MODI@4: pichley chaar saal main kahaan se kahaan pahunchaa desh kaa share bazarkendra sarkaar ke alaava rajya sarkaron ne bhi aam aadmi ke liye saste petrol-dijal kaa rasta baadhit kiya
 Apart from the exide duty of the central government, the state governments increased the sales tax on the sale of petrol and diesel
 kachche tel kii keemton main ai is phislan ke dauraan rajya sarkaron ne petrol par waite ko lagbhag 40 fisadi badhaayaa to dijal par lagbhag 28 fisadi kii vruddhi kar di gai
 Due to this, both the central and state governments did not allow cheap petrol and diesel to reach the common man
 ise dekhen: mahange petrol-dijal se yun bachaa sakati he modi sarkaar? With the closure of 500 and 1,000 rupees, Paytm, the company that provides online payment services, has grown by 435 percent and Paytm is not leaving any chance to capitalize on this decision of Prime Minister Modi

 The paytmk business has seen a tremendous jump of 435 percent since the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes were declared illegal on Tuesday evening

 man kii baat main kiya tha vaadabharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne apane 1947 ke bhaashan main 72 minute kaa bhaashan diya tha

 This book was published in 1993 but i got it on August 28, 2007
 yahi taarikh he or us par likhaa he ki anupam ji kii ore se saprem bhent
 Since then i read this book every year and many times a year
 is kitaab ke pehle panne par lekhak kaa naam nahin he
 Anupam Mishra has written in a very small print somewhere
 ye unki fitrat kii vajah se hua hoga ki koi is kitaab kii bajaae unki charchaa na karne lage, isliye ve baat ko aage rakhte the or apane naam ko peeche
 It was first published in 1993
 dhai lakh pratiyaan hindi main chhapi hai
 For ten years, Anupam Mishra had traveled to different parts of India, collecting our vast tradition of pond-making, its technique and words, but the writer Anupam Mishra did not write in the first page
 is kitaab kii copirite nahin he
 He did not take a new money from this book
 alag-alag bhashaaon main alag-alag sansthaaon, prakashkon or logon ne vyaktigat str par bhi ise chapa, bechaa or baanta
 It is estimated in Hindi that this book has sold 2
5 lakh copies

 This book has also appeared in Braille
 jis kisi ne padhaa wo talab banane kii bhartiya parampara kaa kaayal ho gaya or apane str par talab banane laga
 It is true that we have cleared all the ponds, but it is also true that after reading this book, people have again made many ponds
 anupam mishra rajasthan or bundelkhand ke gaanv-gaanv ghoomte rahe, logon ko bataate rahe ki aapaki takanic he, aapaki viraasat he, talab banane main koi karcha nahin aata he, milakar bana lo
 Why are we all dying of famine, drought
 ham rajanetaaon ke jane par kaaphi kuch bataate hai, abhinaytaon ke jane par kaaphi kuch bataate hai, anupam ji ke jane par agar thodaa bhi kam bataaya to mujhe aaj neend nahin aegi
 Why you should know about Anupam Mishra ho saktaa he ki aapaki koi dilchaspee na ho lekin pani ko pani samajhane ke liye to janaa hi ja saktaa he
 Cities in the city are falling victim to rainy floods and rivers are craving water
 jab nadiyaan hi maranasann hai, to shaharon main baadh kahaan se aati he
 If you are not interested in this, then there is nothing in the words of Anupam ji
 apana kaam he, acha-acha kaam karte janaa
 If i tell the face of the book, then i will also tell some things written on the pages

 It is written that some hundred years ago there were 53000 ponds in Mass Presidency and 39000 ponds in Mysore till 1980

 a Banjara came here and went to build a huge ocean, but these resourceful institutions of the new society could not take care of this ocean

 bijepi kii dilli ikai ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko shanivaar ko patr likh kar od-even yojana ko phir se lagu karne ke kadam par punarvichaar karne ko kaha he
 He says that this scheme will create problems for the people
 tiwari ne kejariwal ko likhe patr main aarope lagaaya ki "yah dillivaasiyon kaa dhyaan mukhya muddon se bhatakaane kii chalbaaji he
 "he has said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has" completely failed "on the work front and wants to use taxpayers' money on advertisements for its promotion
 unhone kaha, “main dilli main november ke maheene main od-evan niti ko ek baar phir lagu karne ke aapaki sarkaar ke faisle par bahut acroshit hokar aapako yah patr likh rahaa hum

 Kejriwal on Friday announced the implementation of the odd-even scheme in Delhi from November 4 to 15
 unhone kaha tha ki is avadhi ke dauraan punjab or haryana main paraali jalaae jane ke kaaran shahar main pradooshan ke ucchtam str par pahunch jane ke khilaaf uthaae gaye saat kadamon main se yah ek hoga
 Tiwari said that the AAP government's decision to stick to the odd-even scheme shows the level of its 'inability' to come up with any scientific and logical measures against air pollution
 tiwari ne apane patr main kaha, “dilli ke logon ke hit main, main aapse sam-visham yojana lagu karne ke is faisle par phir se vichaar karne kii apil karata hum or kripaya dillivaasiyon ko baksh den jinhen is kadam ke kaaran bevajaah pareshaani hogi

 Have you ever wondered what is the biggest weapon for Arvind Kejriwal's campaign? Have you ever noticed what was the thing in the Delhi Assembly elections that made Kejriwal's campaign different from the rest
 
 
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt congress−bijepi ne raily kii, to kejariwal choti nukkad sabha or thodi badi ho, to jansabha karte the
 But apart from all this, there was another thing, which created an atmosphere in Delhi for Kejriwal


 Roadshow


 Roadshow i
e
 getting out of the public in an open jeep from a populated or congested road, street, locality and accepting public greetings
 november ke maheene main kejariwal ne rodsho shuru kiya or chunaav prachaar khatm hone tak karte rahe
 The result is in front of everyone
 dilli main chunaav ke nateezon ne sabko fail kiya, keval kejariwal paas ho paae
 Actually, the roadshow matches the lifestyle of today's people
 public ab aisi nahin rah gai he, jo milon dur jaakar, ghanton bheed main khadey hokar kisi netaa ko sune
 There are many reasons for this
 pehla to yah ki janata ko ab netaa se koi khaas ummid nahin rah gai he
 Secondly, nowadays people in cities have a shortage of time, in such a situation it is difficult to mobilize the public for the rally
 gaanv ke log to phir bhi aa jate hai, lekin shaharon main yah mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 At the time of election, the leader needs the public, not the leader
 ab kejariwal kaa main target shahar kaa voter hi he, aise main public ke bich pahunchane ke liye kya karen
 
 
 When the rally comes, the atmosphere is created when the crowd comes and the message goes that which party is so angry
 lekin sawaal phir ki raily main kitne log aaenge yaa nahin aaenge
 All these questions were in front of Kejriwal during the Delhi Assembly elections and Kejriwal answered these questions from the roadshow
 haalanki kehane main aasaan lagata he, lekin subah se shaam tak logon ke bich ghoomte rahanaa, unase baaten karnaa, unki baaten sunanaa koi aasaan kaam nahin he, khaastaur se jab aap diabetes ke marij hon
 This Ram Kahani heard because Kejriwal is now going to wield this weapon in the Lok Sabha elections too
 vah thodi bahut raily, kuch zyada jansabha or jamkar road sho karenge
 It will start from Saturday 1 March when Kejriwal will go on a road show from Delhi to Kanpur with his convoy
 2 march ko kanpur main raily or 3 march ko phir kanpur se dilli lautate hue road sho
 After this, it is going to happen, whose public, media and all political parties are working on the guesswork
 8 march ko arvind kejariwal narendra modi ke garh ahmedabad main rodsho karenge or iske baad jansabha bhi karenge
 Saturday 8 March will be an important day, do not lose sight
 9 march ko dilli se mathura tak phir rodsho or mathura main raily
 First roadshow and then public meeting in Goa on 11 March
 kejariwal ke pehle ke rodsho or ab ke rodsho main bahut bada antar he
 The roadshow was first done as the leader of a fledgling party, but now the roadshow will be done by the former Chief Minister of Delhi
 ek aisa shaks jo pichley teen saal main tivi par jitna dikhaa, utana to puri jindagi main bade-bade suurama bhi nahin dikhe
 'AAP' believes that its real competition is with BJP and hence Arvind Kejriwal is constantly attacking Narendra Modi
 ab aise main yah nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki modi kii raily kaa jawaab kejariwal kaa rodsho hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biggest dream is going to be fulfilled
 gujaratka mukhyamantri rahete hue modi chaahate the ki sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii ek aisi pratimaa bane jo duniya main sabase oonchi ho
 That statue has been built, which Modi will unveil, but you have to go by the ride of such a boat
 louh purush ke naam se mashhoor sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii sabase vishaal murti tak sabase pehle ajtak pahunchaa he
 See what is the specialty of this idol
 murti main lagengi do liftpatel kii ye 182 meter oonchi murti duniya kii sabase oonchi murti he
 Neither the 120-meter-high Spring Buddha statue stands next to it, nor the 90-meter-high New York Statue of Liberty
 ajtak kii team puri taiyaari ke saath andar us jagah tak pahunchi, jahaan tak nirmaan kaary ho chukaa he
 The new bridge at the front is for the common man to come in and reach the footsteps of Patel

 The litchi we eat looks clean, red, sweet from the outside, but after peeling, i looked carefully if there is such a big worm

 is report ke mutabik, 'mujffarpur main acute incefllopathy kaa prakope hypoglysine e (hypoglycin A) or emsipiji to kicity (MCPG toxicity) donon se judaa he
 Both of these ingredients are naturally present in litchi, as both these increase the blood sugar level at night, so the report says to reduce the use of litchi at dinner time so that glucose levels do not increase rapidly which can cause this suspected disease

 philhal, doctor or research is baat kii khoj main lage hai ki mujffarpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon main incephelitis or japani bukhaar ke peeche kya kaaran ho sakate hai

 Police have arrested Kishore's son Tau and another relative
 police ne kishor kii hatya aapasi ranjish main kiye jane kaa daawa kiya he
 It is said that after registering a case of disappearance, the police formed several teams and was trying to return the teenager safely
 shanivaar ko shaq ke aadhaar par police ne ek aaropee ko giraftaar kiya tha
 On his spot, Kishore's body was recovered from a well filled with water on Sunday
 police ke anusaar kishor kii 16 agast ko hi hatya kar di gai thi, lekin police ko gumraah karne ke makasad se 17 agast ko pita ko kol kar 10 lakh rupye kii phiroti maangi gai thi
 Therefore, a kidnapping clause was also added in this case
 is maamle kaa khulaasa karte hue espi riyaj ikbaal ne kaha ki mritak ke parivaar or aropiyon ke parivaar main beete kaaphi samay se jameen ke bantwaare ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa tha

 He finally took the minor to the river near the river before killing him on August 16, and then tied the minor's arms and legs and threw him into a deep well
 gauratlab he ki 17 agast ko satna ke chorhata gaanv se 13 saal kaa naaballig ghar ke baahar se hi gaayab ho gaya tha
 Even after searching for a long time, when he was not found, the father lodged a report of the son's disappearance at Amarpatan police station

 The kidnappers were successful in taking the children from the border of Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh

 dilli kii kai vidhansabhaon main voter list se naam katane ke aarope par raajnneeti garmati ja rahi he
 On Saturday, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has again made serious allegations on the Election Commission

 Manish Sisodia alleges that 24000 voters from Patparganj assembly, 27500 from Kondli assembly, 14000 from Vishwas Nagar assembly, 22000 from Laxmi Nagar assembly and 13,000 voters from Gandhinagar assembly have been removed from the list

 But later issued a press note on behalf of the Election Commission, it was said that we did not say any such thing
 jabaki us meeting main maujuud sabhi log is baat ke gavaah he kichunavayukta ne yah baat kahi thi
 Manish Sisodia claimed that we got an inquiry from our workers on some of the data that the Election Commission has put on its website
 jaanch ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bahut saare aise logon ke naam yah kahkar kaat die gaye hai ki vah yahaan se ja chuke hai, jabaki vah sab abhi bhi usee pate par rahete hai saboot ke taur par manish sisodiya ne 9 logon ke naam kii ek list bhi jari kii he
 The Aam Aadmi Party alleges that this conspiracy by the Election Commission has taken away the constitutional rights of these one and a half million people

 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ke kabhi chahete rahe amar singh ab pradhanmantri narendra modi ke fain ban gaye hai
 Amar Singh is looking distraught to go to BJP these days, but does not get a direct entry, now he is in the mood to join the back door
 Amar Singh has announced to work for Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 itnaa hi nahin ve apane grih janapad or mulaayam singh ke sansadeey seat azamgarh se chunavi maidan se utar sakate hai
 Om Prakash Rajbhar, a cabinet minister in the Yogi government of Uttar Pradesh and President of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, has demanded Amar Singh to be nominated from Azamgarh seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki agar azamgarh seat meri party ke hisse main ai to hamaare pratyaashee amar singh honge
 Let us know that in 2014, Ramkant Yadav was fielded from BJP from Azamgarh parliamentary seat
 unhone mulaayam singh yadav ko kaante kii takkar di thi
 But ever since Yogi came to power in UP, he has been continuously raising voice against the government
 pichley dinon unke bijepi chhodane kii charchaa thi
 After the offer of Om Prakash Rajbhar, it is believed that Amar Singh can bet on the BJP to win the Azamgarh parliamentary seat
 aise main bijepi amar singh ko sidhe utaarne ke bajaay sahyogi dal ke kandhon kaa sahaara le sakati he
 In such a situation, Om Prakash Rajbhar's party can prove to be a trump card for the BJP
 azamgarh loksabhaa kshetra main rajbhar matadaataaon kii sankhya acchhee khaasi he
 In such a situation, the BJP can take advantage of its original votebank as well as the plan to unite Rajput and Rajbhar votes
 amar singh mularoop se azamgarhse hai or unke kai kareebi netaa bijepi kaa daaman tham chuke hai
 He has a good support base in Azamgarh, especially among the Rajput community
 aise main unke is seat se maidan main utarane se muqabla kaaphi dilachasp ho saktaa he
 In fact, Amar Singh had come to bless the groom and groom at the wedding of Om Prakash Rajbhar's son Arvind Rajbhar on 22 June last month
 is dauraan unhone rajbhar ko bhi bijepi se talkhi par ghar kaa jhagada ghar main hi rakhane kii naseehat di thi
 Let us know that since being expelled from the SP, the saffron color of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started growing on Amar Singh
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii nitiyaan bhi unhen pasand aa rahi he
 Amar Singh was present in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's program in Lucknow on Sunday
 amar singh is kaarykram main bhagava rang kaa kurta pahane pehali line main baithe the
 Modi pointed to Amar Singh and said that Amar Singh is sitting here, he will remove everyone's history
 amar singh ne kaha tha, 'modiji hamen achche lagate hai
 Whether i subscribe to BJP or not, but will continue to work for Modi
 ' amar singh ne kaha ki modiji kaa charitra aisa he ki jiske saath ve sambandh rakhte hai
 Like a man
 ve chota-bada nahin dekhte hai
 Amar Singh is also getting close to UP CM Yogi Adityanath
 amar singh or yogi ke bich kai mulaakaaten ho chuki hai
 In such a situation, the speculation of BJP coming into the camp before 2019 is fast and it will be seen that what will be the next political move of Amar Singh? korian companysghek nayaa smartphone spirit pesh karne ja rahi he

 america magazine Politico kii ek report ke mutabik america trump sarkaar and tu and ancripshan ko bain karne kii soch rahi he
 Significantly, whatsapp is the world's most used instant messaging app based on this encryption
 iske alaava aipal ke massej or phase time bhi and tu and ancripshan aadhaarit hai
 Other secure apps like Signal also use it
 and tu aid ancripshan ko saadhaaran shabdon main samajhen, to yah ek tarah kaa ancripshan system he jiske tahat kii gai chating main sirf sender or resiver hi massej pard sakate hai
 Under this, neither the company nor any law agency of any country can read that message
 privesi ke liye ye duniya bhar main kaaphi pasand kiya jaataa he, lekin kuch deshon main is par aapatti jataai jaati he
 According to a report by Politico, US officials are negotiating a possible encryption ban
 is report main kaha gaya he ki trump administration haal hi main is ancripshan system ko lekar discus karne ke liye mili hai
 With this, it is also being told that the end-to-end encryption has been discussed in the meeting of the National Security Council and this has also been the main focus
 haalanki ab tak is par koi faisla nahin liya gaya he or abhi is baat ko lekar baatcheet jari he ki and tu and ancripshan ko bain kiya jaae yaa phir isamen badlaav kiya jaae
 Let me tell you, Donald Trump criticized Apple before he became American President
 isaki vajah aipal dwaara san barnadino ke ek shooter kaa yphone analock na karne kaa faisla tha
 Apple had refused to unlock the iphone by giving its policy to the user's privacy
 haalanki baad main FBI ne ek security form ko lagbhag 1 million dollar de kar iphone analock karaayaa tha
 According to the report, after the fbi's move, Apple also removed the loophole, using which the FBI unlocked the iphone from a security firm
 agar and tu and ancripshan hataaya jaataa he to na sirf america balki bharat main bhi asar padegaa
 whatsapp users are the most in India and whatsapp also uses end to end encryption
 haal hi main watsap ke ek oficial ne kaha tha ki whatsapp main agar and tu and ancripshan na ho to isaki pahchaan hi khatm ho jaaegi
 It remains to be seen what the Trump government decides on this matter and how the tech companies react to it

 twitter
 com / g9mpm1fjno — ANI (@ANI) September 10, 2018 Rinwa has been surrounded by accusations of the public, including the opposition, after his statement
 petrol kii keemton ko baadh ke kharch se jodne par chaaron ore unki kaaphi aalochana ho rahi he
 Rescued Gaurav Yatra, Ririnwa said that Kikangress has not done what he did during his 50 years rule
 gaurav yatrapar congress kii aalochana par unhone kaha, pradesh sarkaar ne vastav main gaurav kaa kaarykram kiya he, isaliegaurav yatranikaali ja rahi he
 While giving his argument on Gaurav Yatra, he questioned that if we build a well or build a temple, we celebrate Gaurav by distributing the night awakening and Prasad
 yahaan to puure pradesh main 26 lakh logon ke liye makaan banane ke saath kaaphi vikaas ke kaam hue hai, to sarkaar uskaa gaurav kyon naa manaae? It was clear which parties will remain in the grand alliance and NDA in the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar
 sabase zyaada jigyaasa ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party ko lekar thi jisane dabaav banaakar BJP se chah loksabhaa kii siten or pratishtha kaa prashn ban gai 1 rajyasabha kii seat apni jholii main karne main kaamayaab rahi
 Mukesh Sahni, popularly known as Son of Mallah, went with the grand alliance
 mukesh saahani ne pichley maheene hi apni ek party vikasshil insaan party (viipi) banaayi he
 Mukesh, who remained in the news by advertising in newspapers and TV channels, started campaigning by helicopter in recent times
 inaki mukhya maang he ki nishad jati ko anusuchit jati kii suchi main shaamil kiya jaye
 However, the Bihar government has sent its recommendation to the central government
 mahagathbandhan main kushvaha ke shaamil hone par bole tejasvi- yah dalon kaa nahin, 'janata ke dilon kaa gathbandhan'mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone vaale mukesh ne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main pehle nitish kumaar ko samarthan diya phir kuch dinon ke andar hi unhone apana nirnay badal kar endie kii sarkaar banane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The BJP felt that Mukesh had a lot of popularity among the Mallah voters and would be able to break his inclination towards Nitish Kumar
 shaayad yahi kaaran tha ki BJP ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne qareeb 40 sabhaaon main mukesh ko apane saath rakhaa
 He used to take them with him in a helicopter every day and the two addressed the joint meeting
 lekin jab chunaav parinaam aayaa to BJP ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki mallaah votaron kaa jhukaav nitish kumaar ke prati adhik rahaa or kushvaha kii tarah mukesh par bharosa karnaa faaydemand nahin rahaa
 Mathematics of mahagathbandhan in UP: SP-BSP can join hands with Congress, bjp's annihilation is said about Mukesh Sahni that he works to make film sets in Bombay and he earned quite a lot in that business
 lekin inaki hameshaa raajnneetik mahatvakanksha rahi jiske kaaran 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se vah bihar main kaafii sakriy rahe hai
 But after the nda's defeat in the 2015 assembly elections, he moved back to Mumbai but has been active again in Bihar politics for the last one year
 vah apni jati ke votaron ko lamaband or apane prati aakarshith karne ke liye har qadam uthaate hai chaahe wo helicopter se prachaar karne kaa tareeqa ho yaa vishesh rath main gum-ghumkar jila or kasbon main prachaar karne kaa unka style
 But on Sunday, as Mukesh has announced that Maach will eat rice and win the grand alliance and not do politics if the NDA reaches double digits, it seems that he has set a tough target for himself
 usase zyaada unhen sabit karnaa hoga ki unka apane jati ke votaron ke upar prabhaav hai

" is bare main ham zyaada nahin sochate
 "new age players are not entitled to change Kumble
 unki nazar main pehle ke khilaadi bhi damakham se khelte the, fark itnaa he ki aaj ke khilaadiyon kaa match phase alag he

 We do not think much about it
 " nae jamaane ke nae khilaadiyon ko kumble badalane ke haq main nahin hai
 According to him, earlier players also used to play with stamina, the difference is that the match face of today's players is different
 kumble ke mutabik "pehle kii bhartiya team main bhi damakham tha, lekin is team ke khilaadiyon kaa apane aap ko vayakt karne kaa tarika alag he
 My job is that there are 90 overs in a day and during that time i do everything possible to maintain the enthusiasm of the team

 BJP leader Sushma Swaraj has objected to the use of Radha's name in the film 'student of the Year'
 isse pehle film 'o maai god' ko lekar bhi vivaad ho chukaa he
 The question is why in the movies there is objection in the name of God? The new generation Jhoom arose on the lyrics of this song 'student of the Year'

 shartaheen samvednaa kii seemaheenata kaa sammaan he
 Radha is his heroine
 lekin dwapar se kaliyug kii yatra main bijepi ne is charitra ko ek naam main sametakar rakh dena chaahati he
 Not only this, the BJP is also shying away from opening the dimensions of divine faith
 aap sirf itnaa kah sakate hai oh maai god
 The BJP says that let Ram, Radha, Sita, Savitri all remain in the fiction texts like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Durga Saptashati and Hanuman Chalisa
 khabardaar jo duniyaadaari main iskaa istemaal kiya
 However, the BJP has not made it clear what its views are about characters like Kaikeyi, Shurpanakha and Manthara
 vaise aisa katai nahin he ki sushamaa swaraj ko nrity sangeet se koi parhez he
 The only thing is that the tirak is a thing inside the taboo for them
 ab ye nahin pataa ki sanathan dharm kii deevaaren kya itani khokhli hai ki sargam ke dhakke se uski siyasat kii chulein charmara uthi hai
 It remains to be known whether this is a challenge or warning for poets
