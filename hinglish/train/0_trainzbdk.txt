 Inside, Himanshi was lying face down in a blood-soaked bathroom and her husband Doctor Sagar's licensed revolver was lying nearby
 yani himanshi ne khud ko goli maar lee thi
 Immediately the housemates arrived at the hospital with Himanshi, but it was late by then
 chaar vajahon se police ko sasuravaalon par shakmaamala itnaa sidhaa bhi nahin tha, jitna bataaya gaya
 There were four reasons for this
 awwal to ye ki sasuralwaalon himanshi ke khudakushi karne kii baat to kah rahe the, lekin ve khudakushi kii koi saafe vajah nahin bataa sake
 Secondly, despite having so many people in the house, no one heard any sound of firing
 teesri ye ki vaardaat kii sunai gai kahani se mauka-e-vaardaat par kai chizein mail nahin kha rahi thim
 And fourth, as soon as the news came to the family members of Himanshi living in Badaun, they had long accused Himanshi of persecuting them for dowry
 jaahir he, maamla pehali nazar se hi rahasyamayi he
 But now these things have made the matter even more complicated
 to kya himanshi ne vaaki khudakushi kii? kisi ne uskaa qatl kar diya? yaa phir is maut kii kahani kuch or he? tafteesh abhi jari he

 The way to power of the country goes through UP and to win UP it is necessary to win Purvanchal
 isi formule ke jariye bijepi 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad ab 2019 ke chunaav upi main sabase zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Even after joining hands with Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, Modi could not be able to stop the victory chariot of Narendra Modi, but the SP-BSP alliance has remained strong in Purvanchal, the stronghold of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath
 purvanchal main kul 26 loksabhaa or 130 vidhansabha siten hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been elected MP for the second time from the Varanasi seat of this Purvanchal
 iske alaava soobe ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa shahar gorakhpur or bijepi pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya kii sansadeey seat chandauli purvanchal main aati he
 These three BJP stalwarts managed to save their seats, but could not save Purvanchal's stronghold like the last Lok Sabha election
 haalanki, baaki upi ke hisse main sapa-basapa gathbandhan apana prabhaav nahin dikhaa sakaa
 Purvanchal seats in Eastern Region: Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Bansgaon, Faizabad, Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Dumriaganj, Maharajganj, Ambedkaranagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Azamgarh, Ghoshi, Salempur, Ballia, Jaunpur, Gazipur, Chandauli, Baharani, Baharani Mirzapur, Phulpur, Allahabad and Pratapgarh seats
 purvanchal main bijepi ko 6 siton kaa nuksaanpurvanchal kii 26 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi 17 or do siten uski sahyogi apana dal (es) jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 While BSP has got 6 seats and SP has got one seat
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi gathbandhan ne in 26 siton main se 25 par jeet darj kii thi or ek seat sapa ko mili thi
 Comparing the results of the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP has directly lost 6 seats
 mulaayam kii tarah akhilesh bhi felsapa-basapa gathbandhan ne purvanchal kii sabhi 26 siton main se 13-13 siton par chunaav ladaa
 SP President Akhilesh Yadav had fielded from Azamgarh parliamentary seat to try Purvanchal, but could not win SP other than his seat
 pichley chunaav main purvanchal main modi lahar kii raftaar ko kam karne ke liye sapa ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav azamgarh seat se maidan main utre the
 But he could not manage to cycle on any seat other than his seat
 mulaayam kii tarj par hi akhilesh yadav purvanchal ko saadhane ke liye azamgarh kii jameen par 'hathi' ke sahare utre the
 Despite this, he has not been able to show influence in any other seat except Azamgarh seat
 jabaki hathi saikil ke sahare modi-yogi ke durg ko bhedane main kaaphi had tak safal rahaa he
 Shrawasti, Ghosi, Lalganj, Ghazipur, Jaunpur and Ambedkar Nagar Lok Sabha seats of Purvanchal have managed to win the BSP
 iske alaava makshlishhar loksabhaa seat basapa mahaj 181 vot se haar gai
 Not only this, there are many more seats where the coalition has lost by a small margin
 bahubali mukhtaar ansaari kaa asar purvanchal main dekhne ko mila
 As a result, his brother Afzal Ansari in Ghazipur and Atul Rai, his close aide from Ghosi seat, managed to win
 upi ke nattijeyuttar pradesh kii kul 80 loksabhaa siton main se endie 64 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Of these, BJP got 62 seats and Apna Dal (S) got 2 seats
 iske alaava sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko 15 siten mili hai, inamen se 10 basapa or 5 siten sapa ko mili hai
 Whereas the Congress could win only one seat Rae Bareli
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni seat amethi bhi nahin bachaa sake hai
 The Brahmin card of Purvanchal is considered a strong stronghold of Purvanchal Brahmins
 purvanchal kii adhiktar siton par brahman votaron kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahati he
 The Brahmins were traditionally supporters of the Congress at one time, but after the Mandal movement, they turned to BJP
 baad main brahman votaron ke ek bade hisse kaa jhukaav mayawati kii basapa kii taraf bhi hua or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main is tabake kaa jhukaav phir bijepi kii ore hua to maujuuda chunaav main bhi vah bijepi ke saath majbootee ke saath khadaa rahaa he
 As a result of this, Priyanka Gandhi card of Congress also could not run in Purvanchal
 haalanki is ilaake main basapa ne dalit, muslim or yadav sameekaran ke jariye aadhe darjan siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he

 He told reporters in Chitradurga district that Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa is saying that his (BJP) government has given Rs 10,000 to each flood-affected person, but people have made allegations of discrimination in it
 siddharamaiya ne aarope lagaate hue kaha, ‘unhone un logon ko rupye nahin die jinhone congress kaa samarthan kiya tha or sirf bhaajapa samarthakon ko paise mili hai
 To rebuild the houses, funds have not yet been released to compensate for the damage to crops and cattle

 He said, 'we are also in this country, sir

 l Nehru Road, Kolkata 700 071 austrailian captain riki ponting ne bhale hi saat maichon kii ek divasiy shrinkhalaa ke vichaar kaa samarthan nahin kiya ho, lekin bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki maujuuda shrinkhalaa main saat maichon main tiimon ko vaapasi karne kaa mauka milegaa
 Ponting had raised questions on the long series
 Ponting had raised questions about playing the long series after reaching India
 unhone kaha ki tha ki agar ek team pehle hi shrinkhalaa jeet chuki he to dhyaan kendrit karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Dhoni said in the press conference before the match that it is a long series, which will give a chance to return to the series
 jo bhi team pehle kuch match haaregi, uske paas vaapasi karne kaa puraa mauka hoga, lekin puri shrinkhalaa main acha cricket khelnaa mahatvapurn he
 He said that this is not a series of five or four matches, in which if you win the first three matches, then you win the tournament
 zyaadaatar bhartiya khilaadi fitdhoni ne kaha ki zyaadaatar bhartiya khilaadi khilne ke liye feet hai, lekin antim ekadash par faisla ravivaar ko hi liya jaayegaa
 He said that Yuvraj Singh would definitely be fit to play in the second match to be held in Nagpur on 28 October
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main ravivaar ke antim ekadash ke bare main tippanee nahin karuunga
 Yuvi is sure to play the second match
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘zyaadaatar khilaadi feet hai
 Some players have a slight problem, but this is not a major injury
 abhyaas satr ke dauraan ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji main jab bhi koi chotil hota he to aap zyada kuch nahin kar sakate
 "dhoni said," This is part of the game
 agar aap jaldi jaldi chotil hote ho to aap durbhaagyashaalee ho
 "the all-rounder is an important part of the game," the Indian captain said, adding that he did not have the "luxury" to feed five bowlers like Australia and hoped that the part-time bowlers would also be of little help
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘‘ham hameshaa apane kaamchalau gendbaajon par nirbhar karte hai
 They have contributed a lot, especially in situations where we can be helped by the wicket
 dimag main yah ek cheez he, lekin is samay tippanee karnaa jaldbaaji hoga
 "all rounders are important," he said
 agar aapke paas ek acha ol rounder he to aap paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ke saath khel sakate ho
 They are 'luxury' for you
 jahaan tak ol rounder kii baat he unki team main kaaphi behtareen pratibhaayen maujuud hai
 Although Dhoni feels that the fast bowlers had done well for the team in the last home Test series against Australia, but it is not so in the one-day matches
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah bilkul alag tarah kaa match hota he
 The ball is also white
 laal gend se reverse swing milti he, jisase line evam length alag ho jaati he
 There is a reason why Zaheer is not playing here either

 When Rajnath Singh was asked a question related to China's claim on Doklam, he simply said, 'don't you worry, the issue of Doklam has already been reserved
 'grahamantri rajnath singh ne mangalvaar ko chandigarh main pakistan ko kadi chetavanee dete hue kaha ki vah bharat ko kamjor desh samajhane kii galati na kare kyonki bharat ab ekatakatvar desh ban chukaa he
 Cases of ceasefire violations have increased in recent times from across the border and there has been heavy loss of life and property in the firing

 Three-four days ago the Ranger of Pakistan had come and had a meeting with the Director General of our BSF and assured in the meeting that the ceasefire would not be broken anymore
 'sabar kaa imtehaan na le pakrajnath singh ne aage kaha, 'aashwaasan ke baavjood pakistan kii taraf se baar-baar sijafire todaa ja rahaa he
 i do not want to say anything more that our humility and decency are the culmination and we want to maintain friendly relations with all neighbors including Pakistan
 lekin hamaarishaleenta kaa galat arthanhin lagaaya janaa chahie'
 He said that India is no longer a weak country and has now become a strong country
 kashmir ke dipti ko fatkaarkashmir ke dipti mufti ajam naseer ul islam kii ore se musalamaanon ko lekar die gaye ek bhadakaau bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki logon ko jaat majahab kii dooriyaan mitaa kar sirf yah mahasoos karnaa chahie ki ham sab bhartiya hai or yahaan par sabhi surakshit hai

 ' unhone bharosa dilaayaa ki har vyakti chaahe vah kisi bhi jati or dharm se taalluk rakhata ho sabhi surakshit hai
 On the question of the recent stone-pelting incident in Kashmir and the case of the Army after that, the Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir has become very normal now and our security forces are working very effectively

 The welcome statement was given by k Srinivasrao, Secretary, Sahitya Akademi
 udghaatan vaktavy dete hue bal swaroop raahi ne kaha ki bhartiya bal sahitya ko hey drushti se dekhne kii zarurat nahin he
 Indian children's literature is equivalent to the best children's literature of any country in the world
 unhone kaha ki bal sahitya main do visheshtaayen avashya honi chahie jisase ki bal man kii bhavanaaen or kamanaayen prakat ho saken
 We should try to deliver the message instead of preaching to children
 unhone kaha ki sevak kii kavitaaon main bacchon kii bhavanaaen or kamanaayen donon hi hai or unki kavitaaon kii ek-ek pankti rasmay he, ve kahin bhi neeras nahin hotin
 The daughter-in-law of Nirankar Dev Sevak Ji shared many poignant episodes related to his life and presented many episodes related to his routine
 unhone kaha ki ve behad saadhaaran jivan vyateet karte the
 In the absence of Prakash Manu, his seed statement was read, in which he said that the servants did not only write children's poems, but they understood both the simple, inquisitive minds of children and the heart of child poetry
 isiilie azaadi ke baad ke kalkhand main ve swabhaavatah bacchon ke sarvaadhik priy or pasandida kaviyon main se the, jinaki kavitaayen gaanv-gaanv, gali-gali main goonja karti thim
 Children used to sing and unknowingly sing them and get delighted
 manu kaa vaktavy tha ki jane kitni hi pidiyon ke bachche sevak kii kavitaaon ke saath jhum-jhumkar naachte-gaate hue bade hue
 He learned big lessons of life from these poems
 saath hi bachapan ko anand se jeene kii kala, nayab masti or anokhe rang-dhang bhi
 He further said that like other child litterateurs of his era, he not only wrote for children, but also did a very challenging job of giving right direction to children's literature
 ve ek bade or murdhanya bal sahityakar hai to saath hi bal sahitya ke digdarshak or yug-nirmaataa bhi
 And his contribution on both fronts is Lasani
 kaarykram ke aarambh main sabhi kaa swaagat karte hue sahitya academy ke sachiv ke
 Srinivasrao said that the Sahitya Akademi understands the importance of children's literature well and is constantly working for its development
 unhone sahitya academy dwaara bal sahitya ke sanvardhan ke liye kiye ja rahe kaaryon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 In the first session of the seminar, the topic 'nirankar Dev Sevak and Bal Kavita' was discussed

 divik ramesh ne sevak dwaara bacchon ke manovigyaan ko samajhakar likhi gai kavitaaon kii prashansa karte hue kaha ki bachche hameshaa swatantraaa priy hote hai atah ham bal sahityakaron ko unki is pravriti kaa sammaan karte hue hi unke liye kavitaayen likhni chahie
 He also appealed to the parents of the children to read children's literature and said that this will enable them to understand the psychology of their children as well as to choose good children's literature for them
 sangoshtee ke dwitiya satr main ‘nirankaar dev sevak kii vichaar drushti evam bal sahitya’ vishay par vichaar-vimarsh hua
 The session was chaired by eminent writer Sudhir Vidyarthi and Shakuntala Kalra, Usha Yadav and Shyam Sushil presented their articles
 satr ke adhyaksh sudhir vidhyaarthee ne kaha ki nirankaar dev sevak kaa samgr moolyankan hona chahie
 We have discussed his children's literature but have ignored the important adult literature written by him
 unke dwaara likhi gai kavitaayen, sampadakeey tathaa anya kollam bhi adwitiya hai or unpar vichaar kiya janaa zaruri he
 Many important children's litterateurs and writers were present in the program
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan sahitya academy ke sampadak anupam tiwari ne kiya
 Society's thinking about breastfeeding the child in public should still be construed as narrow
 jab kisi jaani maani actress-model ko mahjabrestfirkaraate hue ek tasviir par trol kiya ja saktaa he
 So how can women be comfortable doing this in the pub? This issue is once again in the news because recently, actress Lisa Hayden talked about being trolled over a picture of her son Jack breastfeeding her last year
 Has ieenes se hui baatcheet main lisa ne kaha ki unhen kai baar asahaj sawaalon or caments kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, lekin vah is baat par adig hai ki apane bacchon ko stanpan karana har maa ke liye acha he
 What's wrong with this! Lisa said, "I feel uncomfortable at times when i am asked if you still breastfeed your baby while my baby is still very young
" kuch log mujhase kehete hai ki main gaay nahin hum, mujhe bachche ko doodh nahin pilaanaa chahie
 '🌈A post shared bylisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) onapr 6, 2018 at 12:30 am PDT Lisa said that there are many other things that make her uncomfortable
 lisa ne kaha, 'koi kuch bhi kahe lekin main unki baton se sharmida nahin hum
 Lisa said that it is not a responsibility or duty for her, but a natural thing
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe pataa he ki bahut si mahilaayein apane bachche ko stanpan nahin karaati hai, lekin main aisa karti hum
 i think i am lucky to be able to breastfeed my baby
 main nishchit rup se har maa ko aisa karne ke liye protsaahit karnaa chaahuungi or yah aisi cheez he jiske liye main hameshaa adig rahuungi
 'let us know Lisa has appeared in many Bollywood films like' Ae Dil Hai Mushkil ',' Ayesha 'and' Queen '
 gujarat ke mukhyamantrinarendra modipar rashtriya parishad kii baithak main hamale ke baad ek baar phir bijepi par palatwaar karte huejanta dal united (jediu)ne kaha ki party ko apane sahyogi dal kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or is prakaar kii pratikriya nahin deni chahie
 Reacting to the strong reaction from BJP leaders over the last few days over the attack on Narendra Modi at the National Council meeting, JDU National Spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari said in the state office in Patna, 'the kind of response people of BJP can express They should not react like this
 jediu par jis prakaar se aarope lagaaye ja rahe hai vah sahi nahin he
 In response to the BJP leaders 'advice to follow coalition religion, Tiwari said,' We have not tied the BJP
 hamane na to bijepi kaa pair pakad rakhaa he ki vah hamaara samarthan kare
 The BJP is free to make its decisions and we are also free
 hamen kya karnaa he bijepi hamen nahin bataa sakati
 Regarding the indirectly placed opinion in the National Council about Narendra Modi, the JDU leader said, 'what was being said about
 yah sabko pataa he
 The BJP has to decide what the prime ministerial candidate should be
 jediu koi ummidavaar nahin degaa
 This is our old stand
 ham yah ummid karte hai ki bijepi hamaari patibaddhta or vaicharik bhaavana, niti kaa sammaan karegi
 'tiwari said,' What is being said about JDU is not fair
 bijepi ko vaastaviktaa samajni chahie
 Congress or BJP should not forget that no party is going to form government at the center on its own
 hamaare or unke bich (rashtriya partiyaan) fark yahi he ki ham yadi kisi ek rajya main satta main hai to wo chaar rajyon main hai
 National parties failed to meet the aspirations of the people, so regional parties developed
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘congress or bijepi bhale hi daawa karen lekin ab rashtriya party vaala maamla nahin he
 We also have the right to speak our words
 ’jediu saansad ne kaha, ‘swayan bijepi main pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar alag-alag raay he
 Some are saying that if Advani should become a candidate, someone is saying something
 swayan rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa faisla bijepi kaa sansadeey board karegaa
 He said that the position of the party was clarified by the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in an interview given to an English newspaper last year about the prime ministerial candidate
 unhone saaf kar diya he ki wo pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar nahin he
 The National Council has asked the BJP to decide the candidates by December
 bijepi aise ummidavaar ko namit kare jo sabko saath lekar chalane vaala ho
 Tiwari said that JDU joined hands with BJP at a time when saffron party was considered untouchable in Indian politics
 pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar kis prakaar kaa vyakti hona chahie yah bhi nitish ne saaf kar diya he
 Now the BJP has to declare the name
 isliye jadyu kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke baad bijepi jis prakaar pratikriya de rahi he useaisa nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that there cannot be a comparison between former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi
 kya donon ek prakaar ke log hai? aisa hota to vaajapeyi ne modi ko rajdharm paalan karne kii naseehat na di hoti
 On Narendra Modi being called a secular person by Rajnath Singh, Tiwari said that if this is the case then BJP should be declared Modi as the prime ministerial candidate without any delay
 naam tay ho jaae tab ham faisla karenge
 Now there is no question of Narendra Modi and Advani
 abhi sawaal he ki bijepi kiskaa naam tay karti he
 In response to another question, Shivanand said, 'JDU is also ready to fight 40 if the BJP announces to contest 40 Lok Sabha seats
 har raajnneetik dal apni taiyaari rakhata he
 Tiwari said that if this alliance is broken, it will not be happy for anyone
 bijepi or jediu ke bich 17 varshase gathbandhan chal rahaa he

 a journalist has to deal with many types of people and experiences in his life
 uske aadhaar par vah bahut-kuch likhata rahata he
 'coffee Manthan' is a similar book, written by veteran journalist Vibhavasu Tiwari based on his experiences
 vah apane anubhavon ko vyangy kii style main prastut karte hai or ant tak use dilachasp banaae rakhte hai
 There are two characters in this book
 ek to hai sharma ji, jo patrkaar hai or duusare unke mitra musaddilal, jo unki samasyaayein sulajhane kii koshish karte hai
 Mussaddilal is his admirer and takes his words seriously, as is usually the case in a journalist's life
 sharma ji apane gyaan se use dabaae rakhana chaahate hai, lekin musaddi bahut hi hoshiyaar he or unki baatcheet se utana hi prabhavit hota he, jitne main kaam chal saktaa he
 Despite this, the two have a warmth in their relationship and both seem to complement each other
 lekhak ne kul 20 chote-chote adhyyon main is kitaab ko sameta he or ise rochak banaae rakhane kii koshish kii he
 Every chapter is different from each other, because they have different issues
 lekhak ne shuruyaat kii he coffee manthan se
 This chapter is actually an attempt to show that coffee is important in the life of a journalist
 isliye vah sharma ji ke munh se kahalwataa he ki coffee ek aisa universal brands he, jise har netaa gale lagaataa he
 He also says that talk of dinner diplomacy becomes common, but the conclusions of the things on the coffee table are explosive
 is kitaab ke har adhyay main vyangy kaa sahaara lene kii koshish kii gai he
 The author speaks through a simple language
 har adhyay uske jivan ke anubhavon par hi aadhaarit he or vah use sharma ji ke munh se kahalwataa he
 There is no major talk in this book and the author has not even tried to shed his great knowledge
 vah to bas aam jindagi kii samasyaon ke bare main bataata he
 He chuckles the things of everyday life and tries to open small knots of life
 vibhavasu kii bhashaa sahaj or saras he
 He also uses sharp words
 vah kisi hasya kavi kii tarah tarah nahin hansaate hai, lekin unka vyangy vahaan saaf jhalkata he
 His words are nowhere strong and there is no complexity in them
 ek patrkaar ko jaisi bhashaa likhni chahie, unhone likhi he
 He did not even try to show his scholarship
 apni baat sidhe-sade dhang se kehete hue vah agle adhyay main chale jate hai
 This keeps the reader interested, as well as curious about the next chapter
 kul milakar yah ek sahaj kism kii kissagoi kaa behtareen namoona he, jisamen apane vishaal anubhav samete ek patrkaar duniya ko kuch choti, lekin praasangik baaten bataanaa chahta he
 There remains curiosity till the end
 bas ek baat samaj main nahin aati ki aakhri teen adhyyon main lekhak ne vyangy kaa saath kyon chhod diya? shaayad isliye ki vah apni yaadon main dub gaya or kuch aisi hi rachana kar baitha
 Vibhavasu became a real correspondent of the prestigious newspaper and did 38 years of typical journalism
 samprati vah muradabad sthit iftm uniwarsity se jude hue hai

 Opposing the introduction of triple talaq bill in Parliament by the central government, Congress MP from Silchar, Assam, Sushmita Dev said that the triple talaq bill does not have the necessary provisions for the protection of women
 sushmita dev ke mutabik prastaavit kanoon talaak ko ek criminal offens bana degaa or talaak dene vaale purush ko tatkaal prabhaav se jail bhej degaa
 In such a situation, there is a serious threat to the alimony of women
 sushmita dev ne sansad main apil kiya ki kendra sarkaar yadi muslim mahilaon ke hit main koi kadam uthaanaa chaahati he to usetripal talakka shikaar ho rahi mahilaon ke liye ek corpus fund taiyaar karnaa chahie
 Because the proposed law only uses the divorce thrice, the person is convicted and sent to jail
 lihaaja, kya kanoon yah sunishchit karegaa ki purush ko jail bhej dene ke baad talaak se peedit mahila or parivaar ko guzaara bhatta dene kaa kya tarika hoga
 Sushmita argued that the proposed law of the Central Government is silent on this issue
 lekin kya kendra sarkaar kaa yah maananaa he ki mahaj talaak bolne ke baad yadi vyakti ko jail bhej diya jaataa he ko vah jail jane ke baavjood mahila or bacchon ke guzaara bhatte kaa intjaam karegaa
 Or can the government prepare any kind of government fund for this side and in such a situation, the woman should be paid alimony for one year through this fund
 is sawaal ke saath hi sushmita dev ne kendra sarkaar se poocha ki kya tripal talaak par uskaa prastaavit kanoon pehle se alag-thalag pade muslim samaaj ko mukhyadhara se or alag nahin kar degaa?tripal talaak ke virodh main khaas batensansad main tripal talaak bill pesh hone ke baad bill ke paksh or vipaksh main kai sawaal uthe
 Some of these mps argued that the Domestic Violence Act 2005 in the country is already providing protection to women
 lihaaja sarkaar ke is nae prastaavit kanoon ke jariye nayaa kuch nahin diya janaa he
 Under the current Act, women already have the right to maintenance, custody and compensation, so no new law is required
 vahiin yah aawaaj bhi uthaai gai ki prastaavit kanoon main muslim purush ko jail main daalane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 At the same time, it is not logical that the proposed law is justifying his marriage while in jail

 The atmosphere of terror has been created in the police forces deployed in the Valley after the killing of three Jammu and Kashmir Police personnel, Firdaus Ahmed Kuche, Nisar Ahmed Dhobi and Kulwant Singh on September 21 in Shopian
 sarkaar or surakshabalon ne in hatyaon ko maamuli ghatana ke rup main darshane kii koshishen kin, par hakeekat yahi he ki ghati main polisbal kaa manobal gira he or unke istife kii baadh-si aa gai he
 Especially lower rank officers and jawans are resigning
 police adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki hijbul mujahidin commander riyaj niku ke nirdesan main kareeb do darjan aatankwaadiyon ne batagund or kaparaan gaanvon main tadake subah hamale kiye
 Earlier, similar killings took place in South Kashmir
 aatankiyon ne pulicekarmiyon ko bandook kii nok par unke gharon se baahar nikaala or kareeb se goli maar di
 The slain policemen also included a jawan of the Rajput family who was the only earning member of the family
 1990 ke dashak main ghati se hue hinduon ke palaayan ke baavjood yah parivaar ghati chhodkar nahin gaya tha
 a few days ago, Naiku warned the SPO (special Police Officer) to either quit the job or be ready to die
 ek fasebuk post main niku ne unhen "kashmir kii aazaadee kii jang ke khilaaf bharat kii ore se istemaal kiye ja rahe khamosh hatyare'' bataate hue aarope lagaaya tha ki ye espeo surakshabalon ko aatankwaadiyon kii gatividhiyon or unke chhipane ke thikaanon kii soochna de rahe hai
 Several posters with similar warnings were seen in Srinagar, one of which was also installed outside the CRPF camp
 21 sitambar ke baad, darjanon espeo ne soshal media par apana istipha post kiya or sthaneey masjid cametiyon ko khat likhakar apane istife kii jaankaree di
 State DGP Dilbag Singh dismissed these reports as "sponsored rumors" and said there was nothing new in this and "terrorists had tried to spread such rumors earlier"
 lekin soshal media par pulicekarmiyon kaa istipha post kiya janaa jari he
 The release of the police force through Facebook post was first announced by Rafika Akhtar, a woman SPO of Kulgam
 15 saal se police ke saath kaam kar raheen rafika ne 23 sitambar ko ek video post kar apane istife kaa elaan kiya
 After that many others, including 22-year-old Rameez Raja, posted in the Police Grievance Redressal Unit, posted their resignations
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki istife kii ghoshnaa mahaj ranneeti ho sakati he
 Panchayat members announced a "resignation" in response to similar threats after the 2011 elections, but most of them continued to work quietly until the end of their term in June 2016
 phir bhi, is taaja silsile ne rajya prashasan ko pulavama or shoppiyaan main internet sevaayen band karne ko majaboor kar diya he
 a senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer believes that the increased attacks have affected the morale of the SPO
 is saal janvari se lekar ab tak 37 pulicekarmi maare gaye hai
 The state government is now planning to build houses and guest houses for the families of policemen within "safe" district police lines
 saath hi, espeo kaa vetan maujuuda 6,000 rupye se badhaakar 15,000 rupye kiya ja rahaa he
 As an immediate measure, the soldiers residing in South Kashmir are currently advised to avoid going home
 jammu-kashmir ke ek varisht police adhikari sweekaar karte hai ki in hamalon ke kaaran javaanon ke manobal par asar to hua he*** The speculation market is hot about whose and how the government was formed in Delhi
 is bich AAP netaa prashanth bhushan ne bijepi ko sashart samarthan dene kii baat kahkar siyaasi bhuuchaal laa diya
 But as soon as this came to light, the AAP shied away from his statement
 bijepi ko de sakate hai sashart samarthanah prashanth bhushandarasal, prashanth bhushan ne news channel NDTV se kaha ki dilli main sarkaar ban sake iske liye AAP bijepi ko muddon par aadhaarit samarthan de sakati he
 He said, 'if BJP gives us in writing that they will pass the Jan Lokpal bill by December 29
 iske saath dilli main jansabha kaa gathan hoga
 In this case, you can consider giving support
 'haalanki unhone is intervyuu main yah bhi saaf kiya ki yah unki nijee raay he iskaa party se koi lenaa-dena nahin
 aap's Kinarahua is similar to Prashant Bhushan's statement
 jaise hi mudda garmaaya aam aadmi party ne apane netaa ke is bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya
 Sources were quoted saying that Prashant Bhushan's views are personal
 The party is not thinking on this line
 chunaav ke alaava koi vikalp nahin: aapapako bataa den ki somvaar ko AAP kii chunaav samiti kii baithak hui thi
 The result was that the people did not give the mandate to form the government, so the role of the opposition should be played
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki party ne tay kiya he ki ham vipaksh main baithenge
 Do not take support from anyone and do not give
 aise main dobaaraa chunaav ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 Seeing the growing controversy over Prashant Bhushan's statement, Prashant Bhushan also clarified his statement
 news channel CNN-IBN ke mutabik prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki bijepi ko samarthan dene kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 This senior lawyer said, 'I was answering a probability-based question
 hamen pehle se pataa he ki bijepi kabhi AAP kii ummiido par khari nahin utar sakati
 The BJP can never fulfill the promises made by the AAP to the voters of Delhi, so there is no question of supporting it
 'prashanth bhushan ke prastaav par vichaar nahin: bjpisa bich bijepi ne bhi saaf kar diya ki party prashanth bhushan ke prastaav par vichaar nahin kar rahi he
 According to sources, the party will not take it if the AAP also makes an official offer of support
 iske alaava party kaa maananaa he ki bhushan pehle bhi kashmir or dhara 370 apni party ke rukh se alag virodhibhashi bayaan dete rahe hai aise main is bayaan ko gambhirtha se nahin liya ja rahaa

 Hello Ravish Kumar, if anything is lost in the 2019 elections, then it is serious
 gambhir mudde chunaav se gaayab hue lekin cartoon kii duniya main unki gambhirtha bachi rahi
 It was not an interview that people started laughing
 hmumar nahin hota to 2019 kaa chunaav syrius nahin hota
 Journalists were replaced by actors and questions became latifes
 kai baar to laga ki netaa khud hi cartoon ban rahe hai or cartoonist sirf sketch kar rahe hai
 In this election held in the fierce heat, the news channels were upset
 tabhi chauthe charan ke khatm hote hi 29 april ko bhartiya sena ne ek twit kiya ki pehali baar mithkeey yeti ke paanv ke nishaan dekhe gaye hai
 As soon as Yethi arrived, the boredom of the channels broke and Snow Manav began to be discussed
 vaise hi jaise telcome powder ke vigyaapan main powder lagaate hi himalay kii thandak aa jaati thi
 Yeti became a metaphor in the election
 cartoon kaa kairactor ban gaya
 Cartoons of Satyagraha's Rajend Dhodpkar and BBC Hindi's Kirtish caught Yethi
 326 isapurv main sikandar mahaan jab usne sindhu ghati par vijay praapt kii thi to usne ichha zaahir kii thi ki vah yeti dekhnaa chahta he
 We got this information from National Geographic
 ham sochate rahe ki chauthe charan main him maanav kaise aa gaya
 The answer came two days before the end of the seventh phase, when the great man of Indian politics reached a tendon of Prime Minister Kedarnath
 10 hajaar saal pehle maanav ne kandara chhod di thi, 2019 main maanav nirmit kandara se sidhaa prasaaran hua
 It was an archaeological phenomenon of science
 jaise hi pradhanmantri ne sabhi suvidhaon se las maanav nirmit kandaraon main dhyaan lagaaya, maidani ilaakon main tap rahe twitor vaasiyon kaa dhyaan tut gaya
 Lots of fun

 For the first time, the election of India discussed the Ice Age and the Stone Age
 abhi tak chunaav aitihaasik hua karte the, ab pragaitihaasik bhi hone lage hai
 Today we will talk to the cartoonists looking at this era
 unhone kaise is chunaav ko dekha
 a special feature of the cartoon is that the character is seen first, then the cartoon comes
 lekin cartoonist kaa cheharaa nahin dekh pate
 Know his name
 unke hastakshar ko jaanate hai
 Pawan Toon is a cartoonist from Patna
 hindustan akhbaar main inke cartoon chhapate hai
 Their language is different
 main padhakar bataata hum bas aap syrius hokar samajhiega
 This cartoon of Pawan is taut on TV coverage
 camere vaale yahaan vahaan chadhe nazar aate hai, daudte nazar aate hai magar janata ko khabar nazar nahin aati
 In this cartoon, a voter is saying to the cameraman who is covering the electoral assembly that see e channelva wala k, Chowkidar ji's helicopter did not land, e Hammar Goitha Ghangate climbed the pillar, bring the fastest news
 yah vyangy he ki media pradhanmantri kii raily cover karne ke liye kitna utawala he
 In this cartoon, the expert who goes to the TV debates is taunted
 export ji agsit pole kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Tell your wife to give up tea, just keep drinking the syrup of vine continuously so that the throat is cool, now two days from tomorrow, you have to keep going on the news channel in the name of exit poll
 is cartoon main matadaata doctor ke paas pahunchaa he
 Saying that the campaign is over, he cannot hear anything
 kah rahaa he khaali sannaahat he kaan main
 Cartoons have started going viral
 share hone lage hai
 No longer confines in newspaper corner
 or ab ek akhbaar kii sampatti bhi nahin rahe
 The serial editor of this newspaper does not even know when the reader will run with which cartoon
 satish acharya ke cartoon kitne maarak hai
 Satish Acharya, who has compiled today's issues with his eyes, continues to be a bully in Delhi's politics even while living in the far south
 chunaav ayog ko lekar unke banaae cartoon par nazar daaliye

 Then Bahubali is dropping the ballot in the ballot box by imposing a stamp but now it has come to IT which is managing the EVM machine
 ye cartoon namo tivi par he
 No one came to know when he came asking whom
 par acchhee baat yah rahi ki yah bina bataae chalaa gaya
 In this cartoon of Satish, you see that the Godi media channels are crying that Prabhu has lost our loyalty that you brought Namo TV
 kya hamaara kaam acha nahin he
 This cartoon is also of Satish Acharya
 pradhanmantri ke saamne channelon ke remote tokari main rakhe hai
 The Election Commissioner is asking that Sir, you have a remote of Namo TV
 aisa nahin he ki vipaksh ke netaaon ke cartoon nahin bane
 But mainly the Election Commission and the Prime Minister dominated the media
 manjul bhi kaaphi lokapriy cartoonist hai
 Manjul has made several cartoons about the Election Commission
 is cartoon main amit shah peeche se pradhanmantri ko kah rahe hai ki meri sena, meraa air force kahana vivaadaaspad he lekin chalegaa
 But i do not say Election Commission
 isamen ek patrkaar mike badhaakar puch rahi he ki chunaav ayog main koun jeet rahaa he
 Who will win in Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, Commissioner Sushil Chanda and Commissioner Ashok Lavasa
 aap jaanate hai ki ashok lwasa kii asahmati ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 This corner of the media remained sharp
 cartooniston ne kisi ko nahin choda
 Many times felt that the cartoonists are compensating for the media not being media
 bibisi hindi par kirtish bhatta ke cartoon bhi media or chunaav ayog par apane samay ko darj kar rahe the or share ho rahe the
 Kirtish has a remote in this cartoon
 saare batan par narendra modi ke naam kaa akshar likhaa he
 In this election or even earlier, this image of the media was showing the impression of the Prime Minister to the cartoonists in every item of the TV set
 is cartoon main kirdaar chunaav ayog se kahata he ki is vakt chaukeedaar to aap hai
 Wake up ayog so rahaa he
 You know that World Book Day had fallen in the middle of elections
 isamen kirdaar chunaav ayog ko hi aachaar samhita kii kitaab bhent kar rahaa he
 If there is no talk of Rajendra Dhodparkar's cartoon on Satyagraha scroll

 rajendra dhodparkar ji ke is cartoon main vairaagi maharaj dikhaai de rahe hai
 They have cameras at the back
 chamache kah rahe hai ki maharaj ji bade virakt sant hai
 They have nothing but a pair of clothes, kamandals, mobiles and four-cameraman
 is cartoon main taanashaah koun he, is baat ko lekar compatishan he
 Standing in a cage, the Prime Minister and Amit Shah are calling Mamata Banerjee a dictator, while Mamata Banerjee is also calling him a dictator
 ek kaa taanashaah bhagava rang se likhaa he to duusare kaa taanashaah nile rang se likhaa he
 Watch this cartoon of BBC Hindi Gopal
 gandhi ko lekar is chunaav main kitna kaanv kaanv hua
 Godse has been described as a patriot
 gopal ke is cartoon main kauon kaa jhund gandhi kii murti par chonch maar rahaa he
 Kava is doing it
 namo tivi par gopal ne bhi cartoon banaae hai
 The Prime Minister has life in it
 sir par tivi he or hatheli main aachaar samhita
 Gopal creates cartoons under the name of Zero
 eggzet pole par inke cartoon bhi shandaar hai
 So the way the cartoonists were registering this election, was the media looking at this election from that point of view, is it not strange that the media has also become the character of the cartoon
 jahaan kabhi kone main cartoon chhapata tha, wo ab cartoon kaa kairactor he
 The issue of espionage is not limited to petroleum and other ministries only, but its heat had reached the Ministry of Defense much earlier

 haryana ke swasthya mantri anil vij ke saath kahasuni ke baad charchaa main ai mahila IPS adhikari or fatehabad kii SP sangeeta kaaliya kaa transfar kar diya gaya he
 Sangeeta has been posted to the police headquarters in Panchkula
 anil vij se is maamle kii shikaayat haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar khatter se kii thi
 The SC-ST Commission has asked for a new twist in the controversy
 espi sangeeta kaaliya ke tabadale par SC-ST ayog ne mukhya sachiv se saat dinon main jabaav maanga he
 It was said during the meeting that the hearing is like this
 haryana ke swasthya va khel mantri anil vij shuukravaar ko fatehabad main baithak main ek varisht mahila police afasar par chilla pade
 He told the officer 'get out'
 police afasar ne baithak se baahar jane se manaa kar diya or khud vij ko jhunjhala kar baithak se janaa padaa
 The debate between the officer and the minister over liquor smuggling cases reached here
 baithak chhodkar chale gaye the viennil vij ne fatehabad kii police adheekshak ipies sangeeta kaaliya se baithak se nikal jane ke liye kaha
 Vij leaves the meeting angrily after Sangeeta refuses
 police afasar sangeeta kaaliya or mantri anil vij paas hi baithe the
 When Vij told Sangeeta 'get out', Sangeeta said, 'I will not go
 aap is tarah se meraa apmaan nahin kar sakate
 In the meeting of the Public Grievance Redressal Committee, the disputants were presiding over the meeting of the Public Grievance Redressal Committee
 unhone sangeeta se poocha tha ki punjab kii seemaa se lage ilaakon main sharaab kii taskari rokane ke liye police kya kar rahi he
 He was not satisfied with the officer's answer
 sangeeta ne mantri ko jawaab diya tha, 'ham karrwai kar rahe hai
 We have registered two and a half thousand cases
 inamen se kai log jamaanat par baahar aa gaye or phir se taskari main lag gaye hai
 'but, Anil Vij kept arguing with the police officer and asking why he was not taking further action
 unki baat se aisa lag rahaa tha ki karrwai nahin kiye jane kii jimmedaar sangeeta hai
 When Sangeeta objected to this, Vij asked her to leave the meeting
 vij hue narajaupayukta enke solanki or jile ke anya afasar baithak main maujuud the, lekin kisi ne hastkshep nahin kiya
 Vij left the meeting in displeasure and later said that as long as the women officer (sangeeta) is posted, he will not come to Fatehabad
 vij ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'jab tak vah yahaan kii police adheekshak hai, main yahaan nahin aauungaa
 i will complain to the Chief Minister
 My fight against officials who are not working will continue
 CM should look into this matter entirely: Anil Vijpic

 Tennis star Sania Mirza has a longstanding relationship
 ekbar phir sania vivaadon main ghir gai hai
 The tennis sensation had said on Tuesday that it is difficult to have Sania Mirza in this country
 is bayaan ko lekar unki khaasi aalochana ho rahi he
 Sania has made her clarification on this statement via Twitter
 vivaad par do took unhone likhaa, 'main ek do baaten saaf kar dena chaahati hum
 i have not said that there is no respect for girls in India
 main khud ek rigen kii ambesder hum
 i could not reach this point at all if i had not got the love of the people here
 lekin desh main kai mahilaayein aisi bhi hai, jo shaareerik shoshan yaa yatnaa bhoga rahi hai
 She cannot fulfill her dreams simply because she is a girl
 'padhein twitor par kya likhaa sania mirza nexzust to make a couple of things very clear - i did NOT say that there is no respect for women in India
 
 i am the ambassador for the region-— Sania Mirza (@mirzasania)november 26, 2014and i would never be where i am today if the country had'nt given me all this love
 
 but i am fortunate,very fortunate

 and yes i do believe that if i was a-— Sania Mirza (@mirzasania)november 26, 2014A man,i would not hav faced certain unnecessary controversies that i did! And some language that is being used here on twitter does'nt seem-— Sania Mirza (@mirzasania)november 26, 2014too respectful to me!! So some of u need to clean ur tongue first before wanting to claim that u respect women and people in general!— Sania Mirza (@mirzasania)november 26, 2014 Actress Shilpa Shetty, who was removed from tv's famous TV serial Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hain, has made a comeback in a hot avatar
 wo ek bollywood film main najar aane vaali
 Bhabhi Ji, who is seen in her straight plain avatar in the TV serial, has made a comeback with an item song by wearing a short shimmer dress
 shilpaaka patel kii punjabi shaadi main ek item number saamne aayaa he jisamen wo rishi kapur ke saath dance karte najar aa rahi hai
 Paresh Rawal is also playing an important role in this film
 ye shaadi ke theme par bani ek kamedi film he
 The item song of the film has been released on Tuesday, whose lyrics are 'maro line to health fine darling'
 is papi number main shilpa scindia ke kute or bold expressant unke ek nae andaaj ko bayaan kar rahe hai
 In the song, he can be seen performing many dance steps with Rishi Kapoor and actor Veer Das
 15 sitambar ko relies hone ja rahi is film ke is item song ko gaaya he neha kakkad or aishwarya nigam ne
 It is written by Sanjay Chahal composed by Lalit Pandit
 ye gaanaa shilpa scindia ke phans ke liye vaaki kambek treet he
 Shilpa Shinde, who debuted with the item song in Bollywood, was also in the news that she is going to be seen in the next season of Bigg Boss when she is out of the serial 'bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hain'
 khabare ain ki unhen iske liye moti fees di gai he
 He denied these reports
 haalanki unhone mana ki mekars kii ore se unke paas prastaav aayaa tha
 Shilpa had said about not going to Bigg Boss, she no longer has to work on TV
 wo chote parade par bahut kaam kar chuki hai
 She had said, she fully respects TV
 unhen pahchaan di he
 Let us tell you that Kishilpa Shinde came in the news last year with the producer
 tivi sho 'bhaabi ji ghar par hai' main shilpa ne anguri bhabhi kaa role kiya tha
 He had filed a sexual harassment case against the producer of the show
 shilpa kii phan foloig kaaphi acchhee hai
 See Shilpa Shinde's item song: is tiktok video main tami fat karne kii eksrasise dikhaai ja rahi he, jiskaa naam nahin bataaya gaya he
 On watching the video, it looks like a standing abs workout
 ise rozaana 5 minute karne kii salaah di gai he
 That is, by doing this exercise for 5 minutes every day, all the extra fat on your stomach will be reduced gradually
 yah tiktaoc video fitness freeq naam ke acount par post kii gai
 This account is run by a woman named Kavita Makhija and she posts mostly fitness videos on this account
 madhya pradesh main pichley kuch maheenon main nagar nikaayon ke alaava kuch siton par hue vidhansabha up-chunaavon main jahaan-jahaan bhartiya janata party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, unamem se ek henupapurvidhansabha kshetra ke antargat aane vaale jaitahari nagar parishad kachunaavbhee shaamil he
 According to the assessment, in the last by-elections, the bhajpakas where the base is reduced are tribal dominated areas
 is lihaaj se agle vidhansabha chunaav main anusuchit janajati ke liye surakshit anuppur seat sattadhari party ke liye chunauti sabit ho sakati he
 Ramlal Rautela of BJP, 57,438 out of a total of 1,61,978 votes in 2013 elections from Anuppur assembly seat
 88 fisadi mat paakar chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Jabikangreske Bisahulal Sahu got 45,693 votes meaning 38
 89 fisadi mat mili the
 Bisahulal Sahu has been the MLA for the seat most often in 1977, while Jugal Kishore Gupta was elected to the assembly from 1977 on Janata Party ticket for the first time
 anuppur vidhansabha kshetra se 2008 main congress ke tikat par bisahulaal sahu vidhayak bane the
 He has been an MLA from this seat five times
 ab jabaki bhaajapa ko satta virdohi lahar kaa dar sata rahaa he to congress is adivasee bahul ilaake se phir jeet kii kahani likhane kii taiyaari main jute gai he
 According to an assessment, in Madhya Pradesh, where the bjp's base has decreased, most of the areas are tribal dominated
 is sthiti main congress jeet ke sapane dekh rahi he
 In the Karnataka Assembly elections, the three major political parties- Congress, BJP and JDS are claiming to be the largest party and form the government on their own
 haalanki, pehle number par to ek hi party aa sakati he
 Most exit polls and opinion polls can also lead to a hung assembly in the state
 aise main duusare or tisare number par rahane vaali partiyon ke netaaon ke paas bahaane bhi taiyaar honge
 Let us tell you what excuses these parties can make if results do not come as expected
 bijepi ke liye bada chunaavbijepi ne in chunaavon main apni puri takat jhonk di thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in intensive campaigning in the state and addressed dozens of public meetings and rallies
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah yahaan par deraa daale hue the
 In addition to public meetings, he was seen doing road shows and going to temples and monasteries
 rajya main bijepi ke kam se kam 10 cabinet mantri, 11 rajya mantri or chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantri pahunche the
 The BJP has clearly stated that Karnataka will prove to be the last bastion of the Congress
 aise main bijepi ke liye yah chunaav kisi bhi tarah congress se kam ahm nahin he
 If the BJP loses despite campaigning on such a large scale, then you know what arguments it can have
 pehla bahaanaa-sabase bada sawaal modi lahar par uthaaya jayega
 In such a situation, the BJP may argue that the result of the assembly elections does not mandate the policies of the central government
 bijepi kah sakati he ki centre or rajyon ke chunaavon ke mudde alag-alag hote hai
 Second excuse: In the face of defeat, the BJP may have a second argument that the Congress played the communal card just before the elections
 bijepi kah sakati he ki chunaav jeetne ke liye congress ne aniatik tarika apanaaya
 Let us tell you that just before the elections, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly passed a proposal to give recognition to a separate religion to woo the influential voter class Lingayat community to the Center
 bijepi ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress ke is kadam ko samaaj todane vaala kadam bataaya tha
 The Lingayat community plays a pivotal role in the state's 76 seats
 teesraa bahaanaa-2013 main rajya main satta ganvaane vaali bijepi ko pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main siton or vot share kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua tha
 In such a situation, the challenge for the BJP to do better this time than in the 2013 assembly elections will not be too big
 pichhali baar bijepi 19
 Only 9 seats could bring 40 seats
 is baar agar bijepi pehle number kii party nahin bhi ban saki or isse behatar pradarshan kar saki to vah kah sakati he ki uske pradarshan main sudhaar to aayaa hi he
 Fourth excuse - If the modi-shah duo is not able to form a government, then the party's CM candidate BS Yeddyurappa can be blamed for the defeat
 aapako bataa den ki yediurppa ne 2008 main bijepi ko rajya main aitihaasik jeet dilaai thi or is jeet ko hi dakshini rajyon main bijepi kii entry mana jaataa he
 Yeddyurappa resigned from the post of CM in 2011 and quit the BJP in 2012 following allegations of corruption
 haalanki, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle vah bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the
 In the face of defeat, the BJP can say that announcing a CM candidate before the election was a wrong step, because in many states, BJP has created cms after the election results are out
 congress kaa 'aakhri kila'congress ke liye bhi ye chunaav apana aakhri kila bachaane se kam ahm nahin hai
 Not only did Congress President Rahul Gandhi campaign heavily in these elections, but two years later, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi also appeared to address an election rally
 iske alaava purv piem manmohan singh samet kai rajyon ke congressi netaaon ne in chunaavon main jamkar prachaar kiya
 In view of the performance of the Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi also visited temples, monasteries, churches, mosques in Karnataka
 aise main agar congress karnataka chunaavon main bijepi se peeche rah jaati he to jaanate hai ki uske paas kya tark ho sakate hai
 The first excuse Congress can say is that the effect of anti-incumbency factor has been seen in the state
 rahul gandhi abhi congress adhyaksh bane hai or haar kii surat main jimmedaar unhen nahin tehraaya ja saktaa he
 That is, the local leadership can be blamed for this by not putting the Congress leadership at the center of defeat
 siem siddharmaiya isaki jimmedaari le sakate hai
 In such a situation, the Congress would argue that the people of the state have given a mandate against the work of Siddaramaiah
 rajya main tikat bantwaare main siddharmaiya kii pasand kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, aise main haarane par jimmedaari bhi unheen ko leni pad sakati he
 The second excuse may be the Congress' second argument that party president Rahul Gandhi worked hard, but the workers could not make their efforts to the point
 rahul gandhi ne chunaavon se pehle kaha tha ki karnataka chunaavon main aam kaaryakarta ko tikat die jaaenge or aisa kai siton par dekhne ko mila bhi
 Youth faces of Youth Congress and NSUI have been fielded in many important seats
 teesraa bahanaahar kii surat main congress kaa ek tark bijepi par ummidavaaron ko todane kaa aarope ho saktaa he
 Its hallmark was seen in Shikaripura
 congress ke paas bijepi ke siem ummidavaar bies yediurppa ke khilaaf khadaa karne ko koi kaddavar netaa hi nahin mila, kyonki sabhi sambhavit ummidavaar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye the or congress ko majabuuran apane block str ke netaa goni maltesh ko siddharmaiya ke khilaaf maidan main utaarna padaa
 JDS leaves not open In Karnataka, everyone's eyes will be on the next step of JDS
 jedies ko rajya main kingmekar bataaya ja rahaa he
 With whom the JDS talks, once the election results are out, it remains to be seen
 congress or bijepi donon dalon ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi jedies ko lubhaane kii puri koshish kii, haalanki party ne apane pattey nahin khole hai
 The party's top leader HD Deve Gowda has said that his party will emerge as a kingmaker and not a king in the state
 agar aisa na ho sakaa or jedies ne congress yaa bijepi ko apana samarthan diya to aaie jaanate hai ki unke netaaon ke paas kya tark ho sakate hai
 JDS and BJP: JDS leaders can say that the people of the state have given a mandate against CM Siddaramaiah when the BJP became the single largest party in the first Bahnarajya and supported the JDS
 aise main unka bijepi ke saath janaa janata ke vot kaa sammaan karnaa he
 Second excuse: jds's second argument in going with the BJP may be that the BJP has a government at the Center and it would be right for the state's unrestrained development that the BJP should have the chance to form the government in the state as well
 jedies or congress: pehla bahansiogar jedies congress ke saath jane kaa faisla karti he to uskaa tark ho saktaa he ki vah ek secular party he or bijepi ke saath haath milaanaa sahi nahin hoga
 Apart from this, JDS leaders also attended a dinner given by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi some time back
 aise main jedies third front ke naam par or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue congress ke saath ja sakati he
 In Maharashtra, an alcoholic sold his wife to a friend for Rs 25,000 to meet the cost of liquor
 police ne yah jaankaree ravivaar ko di
 The incident occurred in June in Akola town, 625 km from Mumbai

 police ne valode ko bhi giraftaar kar liya he
 Both friends have been sent to police custody till July 15

 sarkaar ne meri suraksha bhi waapas le lee he

 saath hi party se 6 saal ke liye nishkasit bhi kar diya tha
 About which Rampal Yadav took a fierce target on Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday

 Sonu is disheartened by this whole issue and has even visited the office of Bihar board many times but it is not achieving anything

 At first, this news was only in news headlines but gradually it started to be discussed in the corridor of this parishta

 After all, it is a matter of the life and future of a student

 After this decision of Kohli, people on social media praised his sportsmanship

 Now the Election Commission, taking cognizance against Rajiv Kumar, has considered it a violation of the code of conduct
 mana ja rahaa he ki chunaav ayog ek-do din main rajeev kumaar ko notice bhej kar jawaab-talab kar saktaa he
 The Election Commission has gone through all this because Rajiv Kumar is a bureaucrat
 saath hi niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh hai
 They should not make rhetoric on the election campaign of political parties

 The construction of Ram temple has been an important issue in the manifesto of the Bharatiya Janata Party, but now the tone of the party seems changed
 pichley dinon kendriya mantri mukhtaar abban nakvi ne apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sirf vikaas hi sabase ahm mudda hoga

 paramhans das ne kaha ki agar 2019 main bijepi ko satta main vaapasi kerani he to unhen ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirnaan karnaa hoga, nahin to ham andolan karenge taaki wo chunaav haar jaaen
 The party led by Narendra Modi has been giving the slogan of development, in such a situation, it may make it difficult for the BJP to avoid Ram temple
 If they (BJP) want to come in power again (in 2019) then they have to build the Ram Temple, else we will start a movement & make sure they are defeated: Mahant Paramhans Das on MA Naqvi's statement that development will be only issue in 2019 elections

 One notable feature in this graph is the collapse of the long-term agricultural and rural credit structure (SCARDB and PCARDB), which indicates a deep crisis in the rural economy

 Dual regulation is believed to be the biggest reason for regulatory failure on these banks
 asal main yusibi kaa regulation rajya sahakaari sansthaaon or rigerv bank, donon ke haath main hota he
 The Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS) of the State Governments looks into the administrative aspect of these banks through various laws of the state and the banking aspect of the Reserve Bank of India through the Banking Regulation Act 1949
 isaki vajah yah he ki sahakaari sansthaaon kaa charitra alag tarah kaa he
 These are not only financial institutions, but they also have social responsibilities and obligations
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne 1993 se 2004 ke bich yusibi ko badhaava dene ke liye ek sakriy niti apanaai, jisaki vajah se aise bainkon kii sankhya main ‘teji se badhat’ hui, MCB prakaran ke baavjood
 But after the Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank (MMCB) incident, the Reserve Bank stopped monitoring them
 ‘is sector main paryaapt vittiya jokhim ke sanket dekhne’ ke baad rigerv bank ne kamjor lekin tik sakane vaale yusibi ke vilay / mail kaa rasta apanaaya or 2005 main kai aksham bainkon ko band bhi kiya, jisaki vajah se in bainkon kii sankhya main lagaataar giravat dekhi gai, jaisaa ki upar ke graph main dekha ja saktaa he
 Reserve Bank's plan: Converting UCB into Small Banks and Umbrella Organization (UO) Feedback from Banking Experts about improving the functioning of Urban Co-operative Banks (ucbs) revealed the need to eliminate double regulation and control them Be completely in the hands of the Reserve Bank
 lekin unki is raay ke bahut se log khilaaf the
 In November 2018, the Reserve Bank issued a directive to convert urban cooperative banks into small financial banks (sfbs) in a voluntary manner
 yah chote bank puri tarah se rigerv bank ke niyantran main rahane vaale the, lekin ise kisi ne tavajjo nahin diya
 Marathe said that the scheme failed because the cooperative sector rejected it
 ve isaki teen vajah bataate hai- (e) sahakaari sector ko isamen apana koi khaas phayda nahin dikhaa (bi) is baat kii ashanka thi ki jab in bainkon ko share market main soochibaddh kiya jayega or ve corporate form jaise ho jaaenge to in par amiron kaa kabja ho jayega
 (C) This will end their co-operative character (under which their emphasis is on helping the local people instead of making profits
 )rigerv bank kaa aglaa bada vichaar tha shahari sahakaari bainkon (yusibi) ke liye ek ambrella organijeshan (euo) bananaa, jo ki netherland ke safal rabobank kii tarah ho
 The Reserve Bank's 2018-19 annual report said, "the National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks and Credit Societies Limited (NAFCUB) has been given regulatory approval for a non-deposit taking non-banking financial company (NBFC) ) As UO

 The Gandhi Committee (2015) also approved with certain conditions
 udhaaharan ke liye aar
 The Gandhi Committee laid down the condition that 'the prerequisite for such a successful umbrella organization should be to be fundamentally strong and to have well-run members
 'euo ke peeche soch yah thi, jaisaa ki 2018-19 kii salanaa report main kaha gaya haih (e) euo nakadi or puunjigat sahyog pradaan karegaa (asal main shahari sahakaari bank public ishyu yaa premium par ishyu jari kar puunji nahin juta sakate or na hi unki rigerv bank ke nakadi sahyog tak pahunch hoti he) (ba) iske liye iti buniyadi dhaanche kaa gathan hoga (si) iske dwaara shahari sahakaari bainkon ko fund management or anya kansaltency sevaayen di jaaengi tathaa unki kshamta nirmaan main bhi yogadan kiya jayega
 This means that the aim was to remove the shortcomings of the urban cooperative banks
 aar
 According to the points raised by the Gandhi Committee, how it will resolve the issues of governance of UCB is yet to be seen
 shashan main sudhaar sabase mahatvapurn haiyaanchh ghotaale kii jaanch se pataa chalata he ki isamen vyapak vittiya kuprabandhan hua or aantarik niyantran tantra puri tarah fail ho gaya tha
 In violation of banking standards, PMC lent 73 per cent of its loan to HDIL, which was lent by 21,000 suspect accounts, until a whistleblower exposed the scam
 haalanki, kamjor shashan hameshaa shahari sahakaari bainkon ke liye bada masalaa rahaa he
 Not only government reports, but many experts who have decades of experience in running or monitoring ucbs, insist that their poor governance is responsible for the pathetic condition of these cooperative banks
 marathe kehete hai ki yusibi tulanaatmak rup se choti vittiya sansthaaen hoti hai, jinamein peshwar nazariye, visheshgyata or majboot aantarik check-balance system kii kami hoti he
 He suggests that the most important in dealing with this problem is "separating ownership from management", besides capacity building to overcome the lack of information and experience and the use of technology for better checks and balances

 'sahakaari bainkon kii sahakaarita par ek adhyayan kiya gaya tha, jisamen yah paaya gaya ki bainkon ke sahakaari charitra main giravat aa rahi he or yah unke agm main kam upasthiti, nae sadasyon ko sweekaar karne main kai tarah kii roak-tok vaale dastur, nae prabandhan ke chunaavon main kam voting hona, ek hi prabandhan yaa parivaar ke phir se chun liye jane, sarvasammati se chunaav or agm main sarthak charchaa ke abhaav se safataur par dikh jaataa he
 ucbs are thus losing their cooperative character

 'yaariyaan' yuvaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaai gai he
 
 
 'yaariyan' is the story of five friends studying in a college, whose only job is to have fun and all of them consider it incomparable
 
 
 college ke principal ke kirdaar main hai gulshan grover, or vah in bacchon ko college ko bachaane kaa jimmaa saunpte hai, kyonki college ke paas bane girls hostel par ek australian company kisino bananaa chaahati he
 
 
 The company has a condition that if the students of this college beat the students of Australia in the game then they will leave the college ground
 
 
 film ke mukhya kirdaaron main zyaadaatar nae chehre hai
 
 
 Himansh as Lakshya, Rakul as Saloni and Neil as Dev, and everyone is stepping on the silver screen for the first time, so they didn't expect much, but almost everyone did a good job
 
 
 film kii heroin rakul acchhee actress hai
 
 
 In this film, you can get a glimpse of 'student of the Year', 'jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar', and 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani'
 
 
 lekin phir bhi mujhe lagata he ki yuvaaon ko film pasand aa sakati he
 
 
 The songs of the film are very good, which are being liked even before the release of the film
 
 
 samir arya kii cinemetography acchhee he
 
 
 Many scenes of the film manage to leave their mark, but the film is defeated in the story
 
 
 kai seens main dialog kamazor nazar aate hai
 
 
 The film could have been made shorter, but as director, Divya has done a good job on many scenes, but as i have repeatedly said that a good director should have the courage to wear scissors on his own film
 
 
 shaayad divya ko yahi seekhney kii zarurat he
 
 
 Overall the youth may like 'yaariyan', so from that point of view my rating for this film is 3 stars

 ' In Haryana's Faridabad district, a disgraceful case of child molestation has come to light

 This case of misdeeds is of Faridabad city
 jahaan rahane vaale kumaar kaa nau varshiyabetashukravaar ko ghar ke baahar khel rahaa tha
 Then a man named Vishnu came there and lured the child and took him with him
 aarope he ki vishnu bachche ko ek sunsaan jagah par le gaya or vahaan uske saathcukarmakia
 After the incident, the accused escaped from the scene of the incident
 kisi tarah se baccha apane ghar pahunchaa or parijanon ko aapbeetee sunai
 Hearing about the incident from the child, his father immediately rushed to the police
 or shikaayat darj karai
 The police have registered a case and started searching for the accused
 police ne bachche kaa medical bhi karaayaa
 And then handed it to the next of kin
 oxigen chahie to sawaalon ko ropate-ugaate rahiye
 Democracy gets oxygen from this greenery
 sawaal jitne lahalahaayenge, gahare, ghaney or chhatnar hote jaaenge, loktantr kaa praan utana hi shaktishaalee ho jayega
 See, lack of oxygen (questions) suffocated the children in Gorakhpur
 purvi uttar pradesh main inseflitis ko rokane ko lekar yogi adityanath kii gambhirtha sansad ke record main darj he lekin jo kaam ve apane puure sansadeey jivan ke dauraan lagaataar karte rahe, unke mukhyamantri banane ke baad vah kaam dhimaa padaa or band ho gaya
 The task was to question the government and its system
 uttar pradesh ke purab main machharon se upji mahamari har saal aati he
 Yogi Adityanath used to wake up Delhi by constantly questioning preparations to deal with it
 unhen in sawaalon kii takat akhabaaron or logon kii pratikriyaaon se milti thi
 This would keep an eye on the mistakes, the medical system used to be rattled intermittently and the system was not allowed to sleep to such an extent that patients forget to give oxygen
 sarkaar badalane ke baad na to japani bukhaar ke machhar mare, na purvi uttar pradesh main gandagi kam hui or na hi aspataal sudhare lekin inseflitis se jude sawaalon kii oxigen kam ho gai
 Result: 60 children died panting
 hairaani is baat par thi ki bacchon kii maut ke baad apni pehali press vaarta main, mukhyamantri unheen sawaalon par khafa the jinhen lekar ve har saal dilli jate the
 There are more samples

 Improving the system by learning from past mistakes is a regular process
 pichley teen saal se railway main kuch sevaayen sudharin lekin saath hi kai pahaluon par andhera bad gaya jin par sawaalon kii roshni padai chahie thi lekin prashnon ko lekar bahut sahajata nahin dikhi
 Then came cag's latest report on the plight of catering, cleaning, electrification in the railways, which reversed the entire pink campaign
 notebandi ke dauraan jab log iske asar or kriyanyavyan par sawaal uthaa rahe the, tab un sawaalon se naaraaz hone vaale bahuterey the
 Now, eight months later, when the names of those who died in the queues of banks are seen in the report card of this exercise, those questions are being remembered
 sawaalon kii koi rajnatik party nahin hoti
 Asking questions is not fashion
 vyavastha par sawaal kisi bhi gavarnence kii buniyadi jarurat he
 a senior minister in the previous BJP government tried it interestingly
 yadi unka vibhaag khabaron se baahar ho jaae to ve patrakaron se poochhate the, kya hamaare yahaan sab aman-chaiyn he? ve kehete the ki main antaryami to hum nahin jo apane har daftar or karmchaaree ko dekh sakuun
 Questions and criticisms are my political power through which i can fix the system
 adityanath yogi ho sakate hai lekin ve antaryami haragij nahin hai
 Even after visiting Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, he could not know that there was a lack of oxygen for the last several weeks

 The whole country is shocked by the incident in Gorakhpur
 bhaajapa or sarkaar bhi kam asahaj nahin hai
 Leaders and officials are now saying that the right information is not reaching those who have to take a decision
 sawaalon se parhez or aalochanaon se dar puri vyavastha ko anjaane khataron kii taraf dhakel detaa he
 The chair will be heard exactly what she wants to hear
 sarkarein hameshaa apana prachaar karti hai or loktantr kii anya sansthaaen hameshaa us par sawaal uthaati hai
 These questions reduce the political risk of leaders by saving them from being cut off from their roots
 bharat kaa samvidhan likhane vaali sabha ne adhyakshiya loktantr kii tulana main sansadeey loktantr ko shaayad is vajah se bhi chunaa tha, kyonki yah satta ke sabase bade haakim se bhi sawaal poochne kii chhot detaa he
 The Westminster model of democracy has a question hour tradition in Parliament in which the Prime Minister is also answerable to questions as a minister
 adhyakshiya loktantr main is tarah kii parampara nahin he
 Do not stop the questions from rising, otherwise you do not know how many will be choked
 sayaanon ne bhi hamen sikhaaya tha ki koi prashn moorkhtapurna nahin hota, kyonki murkh kabhi sawaal nahin poochhate

 Recently a video of 10 seconds related to senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has appeared
 video ke saath daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki gahalot ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pakistani jhandon kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 This video has been shared thousands of times on many Facebook pages
 india today fact check team ne apni padtaal main video ke saath kiye gaye daawey ko galat paaya
 The green flags seen in Gehlot's rally are religious flags not related to Islam but to Pakistan
 video ke saath daawa kiya gaya he ki ‘gahalot kii raily main pakistani jhanda dikhaa
 'tricolor can also be seen with many green flags in the crowd
 soshal media par kai yugers ne video ko lekar gussa jataayaa or congress netaa ke khilaaf naaraazgi jataai
 We first wanted to know what the actual location of the video is
 veriphication tul ‘intel techniks’kii madad se hamen ek suraag mila ki video jodhpur kaa ho saktaa he
 After that we scrutinized his Twitter handle about Gehlot's election campaign in Jodhpur
 hamane paaya ki gahalot ne 21 november ko jodhpur ke ummed stadium main hue kaarykram ko lekar yahi video twit kiya tha
 Gehlot was flagging off a religious procession on the occasion of 'milad ul Nabi'

 com / 16pfpf0jgh — Ashok Gehlot (@ ashokgehlot51) November 21, 2018 Viewed by mixing the location and Umaid Stadium in the viral video, it became clear that the location shown in the video is actually Umaid Stadium in Jodhpur and the date It is also 21 November
 ashok gahalot kii soshal media team ke pramukh lokesh sharma se hamane sampark kiya to unhone bhi is baat kii pushti kii
 Sharma said, 'the video was shot on 21 November when he (gehlot) set off a procession of milad-ul-nabi in Jodhpur
 ’ sharma ne bhi daawa kiya ki video main dikh rahe hare jhande pakistan ke nahin balki islam se jude dharmik jhande hai
 Sharma said, 'similar flags have been used in local religious ceremonies
 ’video main dikh rahe hare jhandon main se ek ko baariki se dekha gaya to usamen safed rang gaayab tha
 People often forget to consider such green flags as Pakistan
 pakistan ke rashtriya jhande main bain taraf safed rang kaa band hota he or dayee ore bich main chand or tara hota he
 India Today Fact Check team revealed that the video is being circulated before the Rajasthan elections to mislead people with the wrong caption

 Film Name: Chalk n Duster Director: Jayant Giltarstar Cast: Juhi Chawla, Shabana Azmi, Divya Dutta, Girish Karnad, Arya Babbar, Jackie Shroff, Richa Chadha, Rishi Kapoor, Upasana Singh Duration: 2 hours 10 minutes Certification: u Rating: 3 Star Hindi Film Industry 'chalk n Duster', a film based on the life of a school teacher, has been made about the committed artists like Shabana Azmi, Juhi Chawla and Divya Dutta
 vaise to shabana azmi ne pehle bhi ek baar teacher kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha lekin yahaan juhi chawla ko pehali baar teacher banane kaa mauka mila he
 Is 'chalk n Duster' able to take you to theaters, now full of supposed actors? Story This story is mainly of two teachers of Mumbai
 ek hai ganit padhaane vaali vidya saavant (shabana azmi) to duusari science teacher jyoti (juhi chawla mehta) hai
 Both teach at 'kantaben High School' in Mumbai
 padhaane kii kala ke kaaran hi students ke saath unki bonding acchhee rahati he
 But when Kamini Gupta (divya Dutta), the supervisor of the school, is made the principal, the story begins to have many twists
 kamini is skool ke munaafe ke liye puraane or anbhavi teachers kii jagah nae fresh teachers ko lene kii jid par ad jaati he
 Vidya and Jyoti then fight for their honor and turn against the management for self-respect
 bahut saare twist or terns ke baad aakhirkaar ek achche clymex ke saath film ko anjaam miltaa he jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The script of the scriptfilm is written to support the lifestyle and activities of the school teachers
 screenple riters ranjiv verma or nitu verma ne choti-choti baton kaa likhaawat ke dauraan bahut khyaal rakhaa he, jaise ek marathi teacher skool main or tution ke dauraan kaise pesh aegi, yaa phir class room ke bheetar kya maahaul rahanaa chahie
 The whole scene written for the climax is interesting, you get tied to it like a game show, but it is far from reality
 uski bajaay kuch or tarksangat or kalpaneey sikvence banaaya ja saktaa tha
 However, there are many such moments in the film that make you think and you remember your teacher along with being emotional
 abhinavbhinay ke maamle main jahaan ek taraf umradraj marathi patni or maa ke rup main shabana azmi ne shat pratishat abhinay kiya he
 At the same time, Juhi Chawla has also presented a Mujahra of good work, supporting the truth
 abhinetri divya datta ne apane negative kirdaar se ek baar phir darsha diya kii wo ek pratibhashali actress hai
 His facial expressions were like a treat
 vahin girish karnad, samir soni, upasna singh ne badhiya or jarina wahaab ne sahaj abhinay kiya he
 While doing a special cameo in the film, Rishi Kapoor, Jackie Shroff have also done a good job according to the character
 richa chaddha or arya babbar thode or behatar dhang se apane kirdaar ko nibhaa sakate the
 His acting was lacking in grip due to which it was difficult to relate to his character
 sangitafilm kaa 'guru brahma' vaala geet samay samay par jarur aa rahaa tha, lekin becoground score zyada saraahneey he
 In an emotional moment, this music definitely makes you think
 kyon dekhegar aap shabana azmi, juhi chawla, divya datta ke kaayal hai
 If you like watching movies related to the ground reality, or you are a lover of simple stories, then check out 'chalk n Duster' with the whole family

 unhone padhaa tha ki IIT ke ek student ne padhai ke dabaav main aakar khudakushi kar lee
 With this, Akshay Kumar also recalled his old days
 apana vakt yaad karte hue akshay ne share kiya ki exam main unke number bhi kam aae the or vah fail ho gaye the
 Then his father asked him what he wanted to do? On this, Akshay told that his interest is in sports, then his father told him that he should play but at the same time pay little attention to studies
 jaan marks shit se sasti nahin heakshay nekarib 5 minute ke is video main bataaya ki report ke mutabik kareeb 8 lakh log duniya bhar main aatmahatya kar lete hai or inamen se kareeb dedh lakh maamle sirf bharat main hai
 The main reason for this is the stress of studies and breakdown of relationships
 akshay ne video main ekadam sateek sawaal uthaaya he ki kya jaan marks shit se sasti he or kyon aisa kadam uthaane vaale kabhi apane maa-baap ke bare main nahin sochate
 If you want to die then go to the border, with the matter of learning from the soldiers posted on the border, Akshay Kumar explained to the suicides that if you want to die then go to the border
 akshay nebola ki jaise har taale kii chaabi hoti he, usee tarah har samasya kaa upaay he
 Suicide does not solve any problem
 saath hi unhone bado se bacchon ko vakt dene kii baat kahi
 Akshay said that if there is stress or depression then you should talk to a doctor
 baatcheet karne se hi masale sulajhate hai

 elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne uttar pradesh ke purv mantri nasimuddin siddiqui kii rit yachika guuruuvaar ko khaarij kar di
 In this writ petition, Nasimuddin challenged an order of the Lokayukta

 The Lokayukta had recommended a probe against Siddiqui from the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, but Mayawati refused to order an inquiry
 mayawati ne kaha tha ki unke (nasimuddin ke) khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon kaa mantri kii haisiyat se koi sarokaar nahin he isliye unke khilaaf lokayukta adhinium kii dhara 12(4) ke tahat mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa

 siddiqui or unki patni husna ne sanyukt rup se daakhil yachika main kaha tha ki ek baar lokayukta kii sifarish tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ne khaarij kar di to phir lokayukta ke paas rajya kaa mukhyamantri badalane ke baad uske paas yah sifarish bhejne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Accusing the Congress of trying to garner votes of Dalits in the name of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that a new law to provide 10 per cent reservation for the general category poor on economic basis will develop every section

 Rajnath said, "babasaheb Ambedkar talked about freedom, equality and fraternity
 unhone gunvattta sunishchit karne ke liye samvidhan main aarakshan ko shaamil kiya or aarthik evam saamaajik taur par pichde logon ko aarakshan kii suvidha di gai
 Ambedkar's dream was to ensure equality
 '' grih mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki jinhen aarakshan kaa laabh nahin mil paaya or desh ke vikaas main yogadan karne main sakasham lekin aarthik taur par pichhadon ko bhi aarakshan milanaa chahie
 He said, "for this purpose, the Prime Minister gave 10 percent reservation to meet the target of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
" '' congress par hamalaa bolte hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki modi ke shasankaal main bharat duniya main sabase teji se badhati arthvyavastha ban gaya or is ‘‘sachai'' ko duniya ke arthshaastriyon dwaara sweekaar kiya gaya he

 aaj gajab ho gaya
 The CAG report on Rafael came, but it was confidential even after going public
 abhi tak di vir or hindi main gopneey report saarvajanik ho rahi thi magar aaj saarvajanik hokar bhi report ke kai ansh gopneey nazar aae
 The CAG has written worms of the English alphabet in place of numbers next to Euro and Rupee
 is tarah report padhate hue aapako ye to dikhegaa ki million or billian euro likhaa he magar million ke aage jo code istemaal kiye hai use padhane ke liye jagga jasoos ko hair karnaa padegaa
 You go to pages 120 and 121 and see
 rafel vimaan kitne main kharida gaya, kitne kaa prastaav tha inaki jagah jo sanket chinh likhe gaye hai, unhen padhane ke liye iaiti main admician lekar fail hona zaruri he
 When money was not to be mentioned, how would one know what happened in the deal or not
 kya ye pehali baar hua he jab sieji ne vayusena kii kharid par audit karte hue paise kii maatra nahin bataai he, hamaare sahyogi rajeev ranjan kehete hai ki march 2015 main sieji ne jab rus se kharide jane vaale vimaan mig-219 kii audit kii thi tab har paragraph main paisa likhaa tha
 740 was also written in American dollars
 35 million dollar or bhartiya rupee main bhi likhaa tha 3,568 karod
 Similarly, in the audit report for the year ended March 2016, the CAG has clearly written that the purchase of 24 BAE Hawk AJT aircraft has been written from 1982 crores to 1777 crores
 beshak alag-alag sandarbhon main daam likhaa hua he, magar sieji hi bataae jab mig or haak vimaan kii kharid kii audit main aap keemat khul kar bataate hai to rafel vimaan kii audit main aapane keemat kyon nahin bataai?aap khud bhi sieji kii report padhein
 Start reading from page number 120
 120 se 126 tak bataaya jaataa he ki 15 saal tak kharid kii prakriya kyon radd hui
 In its review, the CAG has written that how much man hours will it take for Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to build an aircraft
 isaki ginati ko lekar vivaad ho gaya
 Second Dasso Aviation denied that it would license to manufacture aircraft in India but would not take a guarantee of 108 aircraft
 yahi nahin sieji ne likhaa he ki dasson company se 7 shreniyon main keemton kaa byoraa maanga gaya tha
 a format was created for him
 rafel ne vayusena ke tay kiye formet ke hisaab se keemton kaa byoraa dene se manaa kar diya
 The CAG report does not mention why Rafael kept talking to him when he did not give the details of the price according to the fixed format
 march 2015 main rafel vimaan ke liye bani cameti ne apana request of prapozal waapas le liya or 126 rafel fiter vimaan ke liye 15 saal se chali aa rahi baatcheet radd kar di
 a few days after that, on April 10, 2015, Paris is announced, there will be an agreement between France and India
 ab yahaan sieji kii report main yah nahin bataaya jaataa he ki koi maheene bhar se bhi kam samay main wo koun si prakriya thi, kin prakriya ke tahat paris main elaan se pehle homework hota he
 Which committee is included in that
 kya do sarkaron ke bich bina homework yaa kisi prakriya ke ho saktaa he, ham is sawaal par baat karenge
 The CAG report has only written that a separate process was going on that the purchase would be on better terms than Tasso Aviation
 wo prakriya kya thi, iskaa zikr nahin mila
 The Indian Negotiating Team is formed on 12 May 2015 after the deal was announced in Paris
 isi team ke teen sadasyon ke etraz kii report hindu main ai thi
 There is no mention of this team's objection in the CAG report
 magar jo paris main elaan hua tha, usamen yah baat thi ki laagat kam karenge or mek in india par jor denge
 The agreement between the two governments is approved in August 2016
 hindu kii report yaad kiijie
 It was there that the Integrity Clause was mentioned in August
 wo shart thi ki bhrashtachar hone par karrwai hogi, lekin sitambar main raksha mantralay kii baithak main wo shart hataa di jaati he
 This is very important, as the CAG, in reviewing the 126 deal, wrote that in 2012, the then Defense Minister ordered an independent agency to investigate whether the terms of the deal followed the Integrity Clause
 to is baar ye sharton kyon hataai gayi, sieji ne kya kuch kaha yaa kaha hi nahin, ham ajay shukla se puuchhenge
 If the CAG report does not get answers to the questions raised in the media, then what was this report about
 rupee ke aage e bi si di yaa a ba sa m ga re sa likhane ke liye
 The CAG wrote that comparing 2007 prices and 2015 prices is complex
 2007 main bharat main banane ke license ke saath 108 jahaaz milane the
 In 2015, 36 aircraft made in France were scheduled to be in flight condition
 2007 main 18 rafel vimaan taiyaar avasthaa main france se banakar aana tha
 Therefore, the scale of only 18 planes can be compared
 main sab sieji kii report se bataa rahaa hum
 If there is no mistake in understanding, then it is all right
 is baat kaa zikr he ki july 2014 main eurofiter 20 pratishat se kam par vimaan dene kii peshkash karata he
 But the Defense Ministry's reply is given to the CAG that it had shortcomings and was an unsolicited proposal, hence rejected
 sieji yah nahin bataati he ki rafel ke nae saude ke liye prastaav kiski taraf se aayaa tha
 Because the old deal was canceled
 kya rafel ne koi nayaa prastaav diya tha
 He took the initiative or India took the initiative
 ab samjhauta 36 vimaanon kaa hota he
 The CAG has written that it has not received any such proposal from the Ministry of Defense that how the shortfall will be met by purchasing 126 to 36
 aage yah likhaa miltaa he ki single ingine vaala 83 jahaaz kharida jane vaala he
 Now come to the matter of bank guarantee
 bank guarantee yaa samprabhu guarantee kii baat thi magar france ne inkaar kar diya
 He said that we will give a letter of comfort
 sieji kii report ke mutabik dasson ko 15 pratishat advance par bank guarantee deni thi
 The seller would have to pay a bank charge of million euros to maintain a bank guarantee
 france or bharat ke bich bank ke charge ko lekar alag alag mat the
 The 2007 agreement also mentioned performance guarantees and warranties, which were to be paid to the tenth percent of the total price
 yani bank guarantee kii shart hataa dene se dasson ko million euro kaa phayda hua
 The AAB which saved the million euros was to be benefited by India, but the audit shows that the dasas benefited from it
 aakhir bharat sarkaar is tarah kaa samjhauta kyon kar rahi thi jab france kii sarkaar uski pramukh maangon ko thukraa de rahi thi
 In September 2016, the Cabinet Committee on Security decided that the rest should be guarantees or guarantees, like bank guarantees
 ek escro acount banane kii bhi baat thi, magar france ne manaa kar diya
 It is being said that this agreement is between the two governments but in the CAG report it is written that in case of any dispute, there will be arbitration of the Government of India with the vendor directly 
 agar faisla bharat ke haq main jaataa he to dasson paisa nahin detaa he tab bharat sarkaar pehle saare kanoonee vikalp talaashegi
 Only then will the French government pay on behalf of the seller
 or ab vitt mantri arun jetali kii pratikriya or phir rahul gandhi kii pratikriya
 Many have said a lot, it is better that you read the CAG report yourself
