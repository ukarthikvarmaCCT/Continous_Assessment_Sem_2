 We have been waiting for them since morning

 airport se kareeb 200 gadiyon kaa kafila manavir ke swaagat ke liye nikaala gaya
 Everyone was excited, from the elderly to the elderly, from the women to the children
 noida main bhi manavir kii ek jhalak dekhne ke liye hajaaron kii taadaad main log pahunchen
 This pit in the map of India is making us feel that for years we have only made complaints
 magar siikhaa kuch nahin
 This is the reason why not many children fall into these pits every year
 kuch in andhere gaddhon se batch kar nikal aate hai, to kuch usee main dam tod dete hai
 Two to four days are noisy
 phir ham sab bhul jate hai
 Until the next one falls into the pit
 or is baar teen saal kii sanaa kii baari thi
 Sana was in a pit 110 feet deep under the ground
 wo kai ghanton tak jindagi or maut ke bich jhulati rahi
 'get me out of here, mother' Just a feet-wide dark pits and a 3-year-old girl of that mother trapped 110 feet down in that pit
 andar wo kabhi darati he
 Sometimes she gets nervous
 kabhi rone lagati he
 She keeps saying it again and again
 mummy pleez mujhe nikaalo
 There is a lot of fear here
 wo majaboor maa bhi kya kare
 How to remove a piece of your liver from a pits 110 feet deep? jab kuch nahin samaj aata to isi gaddhe main munh ghusaakar apni bacchee ko dilasa dene lagati he
 The daughter continues to comfort the mother and again and again, the daughter says not to worry, here we are
 tumhaare paas
 You will not let anything happen
 nikaal lenge
 We are here par gaddhe se zaraa si der ke liye bhi jaise hi koi awaz nahin sunai detii to ye bebas maa daudkar us tivi screen kii taraf bhaagti jisamen sisitivi kii tasviir nazar aa rahi he
 You would have been comforted after seeing the picture
 magar phir jaise hi tivi par dikhti bacchee harakat karnaa band kar detii to ye maa patrakaron ke saamne haath jodne lagati
 Just do a request
 kaise bhi karo
 Save my baby girl
 sisitivi camere se nigaraneegadde ke andar jo chlose circuit camera daalaa gaya he, usase ye manzar dikhaai de rahaa he
 Pits dug for borewells
 jisamen aadhi jagah to pani niklane vaale is pipe ne gher rakhi he
 And this is the child who is confined in the rest of the place
 sirf haath kii ungaliyon main hone vaali jumbeish hi ye ishaara de rahi hai ki bacchee abhi zindaa he
 Otherwise, the whole body is stained in mud in such a way that it is not understood where the head and feet are
 boring main daalaa gaya oxijan pipebihar ke munger main mangalvaar ko dopaher kareeb 3 baje 3 saal kii maasoom sanaa is borwell main giri or tab se hi puraa kaa puraa parivaar is borwell ke paas or padosi ghar ke baahar jamaa hai
 The administrative staff also showed complete urgency and immediately on reaching the spot, an oxygen pipe was sent to the borewell so that Sana's breath would continue
 davaaiyaan or pani bhi lagaataar diya ja rahaa tha
 Sanaa's voice subsided, and the family members passed away while crying and pleading
 magar jab raat ai to maa or zyada ghabaraane lagi
 She did not even want to keep the girl awake overnight
 or sone bhi nahin dena chaahati thi
 Because if the sound of Sanaa would stop in the borewell below 110 feet, then the breath of the householders would stop
 maa kaa ro rokar tha bura halamangalvaar kii raat sanaa kii maa kaa ro-rokar bura haal tha
 To encourage her daughter, she used to do everything possible overnight
 har thodi-thodi der main wo bacchee ko dilasa detii rahi
 We are not here to worry kisi tarah raat beeti or buudhvaar kii subah hui or phir shuru hua bacchee ko borwell se nikaalane kaa oparation
 The life of Sanasana, which was stuck 110 feet below, was now at the mercy of the police, administration and rescue team
 andiaref, esadiaref or sena maukey par thi
 Now this team had to land in a pit 110 feet deep below the ground
 magar utarane ke liye rasta to hona chahie naa or rastaa tha nahin
 Therefore, like Hamsha, the first path was made and this road was made by digging the road
 aise shuru hua rescue oparationbuudhvaar kii subah hote hi munger ke murgiyachak mohalle main sena or prashasan kii chahal pahal badhane lagi
 Due to the extremely dense area, the rescue team had no other way but to dig this road and reach the place where Sana was trapped
 jesibi mashin ke zarie sadak khodne kaa kaam yun to raat main hi shuru ho gaya tha
 But by morning, this work went on a war footing
 kai tiimon ne milakar chand ghanton main hi sadak par lanbaa chaudaa gaddha khod daalaa
 First, the pit was made on the road at a deep depth and then a flat tunnel was made from there to reach Sanaa
 haalanki is khudaai main kai tarah kii dikkatein ain magar sanaa ko bachaane ke liye andiaref or esadiaref kii team ne apni puri takat jhonk di
 The tomb-makers dug up the pit, despite the dense terrain and all the difficulties, the task of constructing parallel channels was not easy
 kahin koi galati kii gunjaaish naa rah jaae lihaaza prashasan ne bachaav kaary main un mazdooron ko bhi laga liya jo kabr khodate hai
 Because these laborers are expert in digging pits by order
 bada ajab manzar tha bihar ke munger main
 Till now, the hands digging the grave after death were digging the pit for life today
 sanaa ko bachaane main laga di puri taqatudhar, jameen ke andar camera lagaataar chaalu tha
 It was seen from the same camera that Sana was trapped in a plastic pipe inserted for boring at a depth of 35 feet
 ghar main boring kaa kaam kar rahe kaarigaron ke mutabik jis gaddhe main sanaa fansi hui thi use boring ke liye 220 feet gaharaa kiya gaya tha
 In which greybull had also been put up to 125 feet
 lihaaza sanaa tak pahunchane ke liye rescue team ko bahut ehtiyaat baratna padegaa varanaa sanaa neeche kii taraf bhi ja sakati he
 In the meantime, all efforts were made to save Sanaa by bringing the entire area to a halt
 aakhri vakt main zyaada vakt isliye laga kyonki jo samanaantar gaddha khoda gaya
 In it, only one man could do the work of digging
 yahaan zyaada gaharaa gaddha khodne kii naa to jagah thi or naa hi vakt lihaaza prashasan ke hisaab se ye sabase behatar koshish thi
 
 
 
 or batch gai maasoom kii jindagiye koshish rang laai
 By evening, the rescue team reaches a distance of seven feet from Sanaa
 ab yahaan se or ehtiyaat baratane kii jarurat thi
 Work slows down
 phir aahista-aahista aakhirkaar jindagi ke do haath sanaa ke haathon tak pahunch jate hai
 And Sana is saved after about 30 hours
 or is tarah se sena, andiaref, esadiaref or sthaneey prashasan kii koshish kaamyaab hui
 Sana's life was saved

 Filmmaker Muzaffar Ali is disappointed
 1981 main rekha ke saath clasik 'umrao jaan' banane vaale filmkaar apni nai film period drama 'jaanisar' ko lekar pareshaan hai
 Pernia Khureshi and Pakistani actor Imran Abbas starrer 'janissar' are not getting screens for release
 nateeja yah he ki muzaffar ali ko film release kii date badalani padi
 Muzaffar Ali wanted the film to be released on Independence Day as the film was of that era, but the date is already booked in cinema halls by Karan Johar for his film 'brothers'
 iske baad muzaffar ali ne agast 21 ko film release karne kii sochi to saamne aa khadi hui umesh shukala kii abhishek bachchan-rishi kapur starer 'ol iz wel'
 The comments muzaffar ali ne ab 'jaanisar' ko 7 agast ko hi release karne kii thaan lee he
 He said, 'how can i compete with multi-starrer films with big budget noise
 'killa', 'masaan' or mere jaise chote filmkaar kii filmein log pasand to karte hai, lekin haul nahin milte
 Comparing Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama 'baji Rao Mastani', 70-year-old Muzaffar Ali said, 'I made' Janissar 'in 54 days while' Baji Rao Mastani 'was made in 300 days
 
 Are big stars
 bade bajet bada prachaar
 No comparison to my film
 bahubali or bajrangi bhaijan ke daur main chote filmkaaron ko darshakon tak apni filmein pahunchaana hi sabase badi chunauti he
 However, now Muzaffar Ali's 'janissar' is looking forward to August 7, but there is no guarantee that the audience will come in the halls despite making a great film
 Muzaffar Ali is well aware of this
 muzaffar ali chaahate the kii film swatantraaa diwas ko release karen kyonki film us jamaane kii he, lekin date pehle se hi cinema holls main karan johar ne book kar rakhi he apni film 'bros' ke liye
 After this, Muzaffar Ali thought of releasing the film on August 21 and then came to the fore with Umesh Shukla's Abhishek bachchan-rishi Kapoor starrer 'all Is Well'
 tippaniyan Muzaffar Ali is now determined to release 'janisar' on 7 August itself 
 unhone kaha, 'main bade bajet kii shor sharabe vaali multi starer filmon se kaise muqabla kar saktaa hum
 People like 'killa', 'masaan' and films of small filmmakers like me, but do not get the hall
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii period drama 'baaji raav mastaani' se tulana par 70 saal ke muzaffar ali ne kaha, maine 'jaanisar' 54 dinon main banaai vahiin 'baaji raav mastaani' 300 din main bani he
 
 bade sitare hai
 Big budget big promotion
 meri film se koi tulana nahin
 In the era of Bahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan, the biggest challenge for small filmmakers is to get their films to the audience
 baharhaal, ab muzaffar ali kii 'jaanisar' 7 agast kaa munh taak rahi he, lekin behtareen film banane ke baavjood holls main darshak aaenge isaki koi guarantee nahin he yah baat muzaffar ali bhi acchhee tarah se jaanate hai

 Aparna Sen is looking gorgeous in her shiny yellow chiffon saree in the office on the 18th floor of Malini banerjeesrivankatesh Films
 unki film ghare bire aaj, 15 november ko relies hone vaali he jiskaa prachaar jor-shor se shuru ho chukaa he
 His three leading actors, Jisshu Sengupta, Anirban Bhattacharya and debutant actress Tuhina Das, are moving from room to room while Sen sits leisurely
 yah unka pehla pradarshan nahin he
 About Ghare Byre Today, Sen says that he had a dream: "in the dream, he saw a man who is making a film on Ghare Byré for the first time in a contemporary setting
 main neend se jaag gai or mujhe mahasoos hua ki vah aadmi shaayad main thi
 Even though he was a man and it was not my first film, he was still me because every film is a first film
 ’’ ve bataati hai ki rabindranath tagore ke upanyaas ghare bire (ghar or duniya) par aadhaarit unki yah film 1984 main isi upanyaas par banaai sathyajith re kii film se bahut alag he, kyonki unhone ise aaj banaaya he or isamen kirdaar ‘‘alag-alag prishthbhumi’’ (bengali, bihari, brahmïna, dalit) kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai, jabaki mul upanyaas kii prishthbhumi aazaadee ke pehle ke bengal main swadeshi andolan ke dauraan kii he
 The 74-year-old Sen is competing with the works of Tagore and Ray, who are worshiped in Bengal, but are not nervous
 ‘‘mujhe vishwaas he ki ye ‘devtaa’ meri viraasat kaa hissaa hai, isliye mujhe unki kritiyon ko chune kaa puraa haq he
 i have infinite love and respect for him and this feeling also gives me the freedom to review and critique his works, to keep or discard a part of it
 to aakhir unhone kin anshon ko choda he? ve kahati hai, ‘‘maine is baar faisla liya tha ki sathyajith re kii ghare bire dobaaraa na dekhuun
 Many years ago i saw that film once
 main uski nakal nahin karnaa chaahati
 However, i have read the novel many times, so that i can say that my film is a cinematic version of a literary work
 ’’unki adhikansh filmon main rajnatik dhruvikaran ke rang bhi jhalkate hai
 In response, Sen says that ideological differences have entered every household today
 ‘‘main ise apane doston ke bich bhi mahasoos karti hum, parivaar ke andar bhi vichaardhaaraein puri tarah banty hui hai
 This time at our Bijoya lunch, we had decided that we would not discuss politics
 hamaari film yahi dikhalaati he ki kaise raajnneeti dhire-dhire hamaare jivan ke kone-kone main paanv pasaar chuki he
 "sen has dedicated Ghare Bire Aaj to Gauri Lankesh today, because she believes that" she was a liberal who was silenced
 kisi bhi aawaaj ko khamosh nahin karnaa chahie
 i was very sad
 ’’ is saal july main sen or mashhoor hastiyon ke ek dal ne bheed kii hinsak vaardaat kii badhati sankchaya par pradhanmantri ko ek khulaa patr bheja tha
 As a result, sedition charges were dropped against him
 par ve ghabaraai nahin
 This filmmaker says that she is not afraid
 ‘‘mere paas chupaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 Everyone knows that i am a left-liberal
 par main yah bhi saaf karnaa chaahuungi ki main kisi bhi rajnatik dal se judi nahin
 i never land any gift or favor or even an inch from any party
 ’’ ve kahati hai, ‘‘adur (gopalkrishnan) ne jab yah suna to badi der tak hansate rahe
 There was nothing like treason in that letter
 ’’sen ek aisi mahila hai jo kisi bhi jagah apni baat rakhane main nahin hichaktin
 His honesty towards politics was developed in the time he spent as editor of magazines like Sanand, Paroma and Prothoma
 sen ne bataaya ki ek baar unhen ek makapa netaa ke saakshaatkaar ke liye bheja gaya tha
 She says, "when the matter of religion arose, they said that there is a temple at the crossroads which they can break
" tab maine unase poocha tha ki kya yahi vajah he ki vamapanthiyon kaa logon se naata tut rahaa he?’’ek patrkaar or film nirmaataa ke rup main sen kahati hai ki unhone virodh ko samajhane ke liye ise apana kaarobaar bana liya
 "right-wing ideology believes that you cannot ignore the fact that India is basically a religious country
" communiston ko jo maananaa he, maan sakate hai lekin ve is tathy ko nakaar nahin sakate ki yahaan saamaanya log gahari dharmik pravriti ke hai
 Religion can be used to unite rather than divide
 ’’ sen kahati hai, ‘‘hindu dharm main advaitvaad ko hi dekhen jiskaa arth he koi bhi anya nahin or har koi paramatma kaa hissaa he
 Similarly, Sufism in Islam also gives beautiful messages
 ’’aparnaa sen ke anusaar, har vyakti main raajnneeti saans leti he chaahe vah aisa soche yaa nahin
 She admits that her earlier films were more feminist
 lekin arshinagar (2015) or mistar and misses ayyar (2002) or ab ghare bire aaj main sampradayikta ke tatwon ko dikhaaya gaya he
 "I am interested in showing how outside politics affects relationships within the home
" maine hameshaa vaastavik jivan kii ghatnaon kaa istemaal kiya he or unhen filmon main jagah di he

 a high-voltage drama between Koyna and Shahnaz Gill was seen in Bigg Boss house
 punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ne deraa sachkhand ke pramukh sant niranjan das kii sthiti ke bare main jaankaree lee
 He was seriously injured in an attack in Vienna on Sunday
 badal ne das ko phone kiya or unki dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se baat kii

 is bich rajya sarkaar ne vienna kii ghatana ke baad punjab main faili hinsa main marane vaale logon ke pariwaron ke liye paanch lakh rupaye kii anugrah raashi kii ghoshnaa kii
 Rajasthan is the first state to have go-ministries and Cow Ministers
 sarkaar gau tex lagaati he
 But there are reports of cows dying from Rajasthan
 ab rajasthan sarkaar ke pashu chikitsaalay ke gaushala main kutton ke noch-noch kar bachade ko khaane kii dardanaak tasviren saamne ai hai
 Those who maintain the cowshed say that a mistake has been made, it will not happen now
 haalanki aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Because 11 months ago, thousands of cows died in a government cowshed in Kehingonia, Rajasthan, after which it was expected that the state government would do something for better upkeep of cows living in cowshed
 10 din pehle hi lagaae gaye the sisitivi cameremgar yah sach he ki gaushala main bahut dinon se gaay-bachhadon ko kute kaat kar kha rahe hai or 10 din pehle kuch logon ne isi vajah se vahaan camere laga die the
 The five-light area of MI Road, the most VIP area of jaipur city
 yaheen par rajasthan sarkaar kaa sabase bada pashu chikitsaalay he
 a cowshed for sick cows is also running in this veterinary hospital since 1980
 lekin is gaushala kii jo tasviren sisitivi camere main kaid hui hai, vah dil dahala dene vaali he
 The pictures are of the night, showing that the mother is tied on one side and in front of her, the dog is eating her fortified calf and the mother of the calf is looking helpless
 gaushala kii tuuti bartuti hui baad se pehle ek kutta gaushala ke andar aata he, uske peeche-peeche doosraa kutta bhi aa jaataa he, phir teesraa kutta bhi andar ghus aata he
 The three dogs then attacked and killed the calf
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki yah pehali baar hua he
 In this gaushala, there have been earlier incidents of killing of cows and their small calves by dogs like this
 isaki asaliyat jaanane ke liye kuch gaubhakton ne gaushala main sisitivi camere laga die, jisamen do november ko ye tasviren kaid huin
 Aajtak's team reached Gaushala Herat's point is that when Aajtak's team reached here, at that time there were dogs and cats roaming around in the cowshed and there was no one to stop them
 is goshaala ko pashupaalan vibhaag nejiv kalyaan parishadko sanchaalan ke liye de rakhaa he
 For this, doctors have also been appointed by the Government of Rajasthan
 board par aap dekh sakate hai ki sabhi logon kii duty or duty kaa samay darj he, magar yahaan koi nahin rahata
 Gaushala personnel accepted the mistake of Secretary of the Welfare Council
 dies bhandari hon yaa phir keretekar kunj bihari, sab yahi kah rahe hai ki galati ho gai, ab nahin hogi
 The condition of this Gaushala is so bad that insects have been planted in the water and feed kept for the animals to drink
 yahaan rojaanaa kareeb 20 gaayen aati hai, jisamen se rojaanaa kareeb 10 gaayen mar jaati hai
 The state government has collected 113 crores this year in the form of Goseva tax, but it seems that the situation of gaushalas in the state has not changed yet
 aam aadmi party ne didisie main gadbady hone kaa daawa karne ke liye bharat kii test cricket team ke captain viraat kohli ke ek saakshaatkaar kaa guuruuvaar ko istemaal kiya
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was the head of this body at the time of this alleged disturbance
 aap ne daawa kiya ki rashtriya team ke kai khilaadi didisie main kathith aniyamittaaon ke sambandh main party ke sampark main the
 The AAP also challenged the cricket body to file a defamation suit against him
 cricket sanstha ne kal aisa karne kii dhamkee di thi
 AAP leader Ashutosh said, "in yesterday's press conference, DDCA acting president Chetan Chauhan said that DDCA introduced a player like Virat Kohli who became the captain of the Indian team
" unhone yah daawa bhi kiya ki viraat kohli ne shri arun jetali kii prashansa kii he
 "the AAP leader said," But in an interview to a national daily on December 18, the same player said that he was asked to compromise (favors) to include him in the under-14 team
 unke pita ne ise khaarij kar diya tha or tab jetali didisie ke adhyaksh the
 This reflected that there were irregularities in the selection of the team
 ’’ Interestingly, several players, including Kohli, have come forward in support of the Finance Minister after being accused of alleged irregularities in the DDCA against Jaitley
 aap ne kal jetali par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone 2011 main ek bank ke kikret club se judi jaanch ko ‘‘band’’ karne ke liye dilli police ke tatkaaleen ayukta par dabaav daalaa tha
 On the other hand, suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad claimed that the sfio's investigation report recommended "prosecution" against Jaitley
 ashutosh ke anusaar us samay, ‘‘vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main jetali ne didisie kii aniyamittaaon main shaamil logon ko bachaane kaa prayaas kar sanvaidhanik aparaadh kiya he, yah aparaadh desh ke khilaaf he

You tried to pressure him in both your letters to the Delhi Police
 jetali se party ne sawaal kiya ki kya aap ghotaale ko dabaane kaa prayaas nahin kar rahe the
 The AAP claimed that several players of the national team were in touch with the party regarding alleged irregularities in the DDCA
 aap ne cricket nikaay ko uske khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa daakhil karne kii chunauti bhi di
 The cricket body had threatened to do so yesterday

 vahiin bhaajapa ke nilambit saansad kirti aaazaad ne daawa kiya ki esaio kii jaanch report main jetali ke viruddh ‘‘abhiyojan’’ kii sifarish kii gai thi
 According to Ashutosh, at that time, Jaitley, as the Leader of the Opposition, committed a constitutional offense by trying to save those involved in the DDCA irregularities, a crime against the country

 mumbai hamalon se pehle david hedli ke sambandh main soochna saajha karne ke mudde par bharat or america ke bich aaj aarope-pratyarope jari rahaa
 While US Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer maintained that the US provided regular and continuous information, India denied it
 grih sachiv ji ke pillai ne kaha ki bhartiya agenciyaan hedli ke bare main vishisht suchanaaen pradaan nahin kiye jane se niraash hai
 At the same time, Romer told reporters that the US provided regular and continuous information to India even before the 26 November attack
 romar ne kaha, ‘america ne mumbai hamalon ke pehle bhi bharat ke saath niyamit aadhaar par khufia suchanaaen saajha kin
 We also shared information after the Mumbai attacks
 ab yah prakruti main aitihaasik or apratyaashit he
 It is saving lives on a daily basis
 ’ unase pillai kii tippanee ke bare main poocha gaya tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki bhartiya agenciyaan hedli ke bare main vishisht suchanaaen pradaan nahin kiye jane se niraash hai kyonki isse hamalon ke pehle duusari yatra ke dauraan hedli ko giraftaar karne main desh ko madad mil sakati thi
 Reacting quickly to the US ambassador's statement, Pillai said, "I believe US officials could have shared the name of David Headley with the Indian government especially before or after the November 26 attack
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘isliye main kahata hum ki ham is baat se thode niraash hai ki david hedli ke naam ko 26 november ke hamale ke pehle yaa 26 november ke baad bhi jab vah bharat aayaa to hamase saajha nahin kiya gaya
 "when asked if he thought Headley was a source of information for the United States about lashkar-e-taiba or other terrorist groups," Pillai said, "it can happen
" ham nahin jaanate ki kya david hedli america ke liye strot tha
 The American government never said that he was the source for that
 ’pillai ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak hamaara sawaal he to vah lashkar-e-tayba kaa aadmi tha or bharat par hamale kii yojana banane main usne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai or uski lashkar ke sheersh padaadhikariyon tak pahunch thi
 "recounting his experience as a member of the commission set up to investigate the September 11 attack on the US, Romer said that despite being a US commission, the investigating body had to interrogate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the conspirator and accused of a terrorist attack on America
" Was not allowed
 america rajdoot ne kaha, ‘jab bharat ne america se hedli se sampark karne ke liye kaha, hamane karaayaa
 Because India is our strategic partner and friend and we can share intelligence regularly and continuously
 ’ romar ne kaha, ‘isliye bharat hedli se poochtacha kar sakaa or mumbai se pehle kya hua, yah usase puch sakaa
 We are not afraid of what he will say
 balki hamane to bharat ko mauka diya ki vah jo chaahe poocha saktaa he
 'india has been consistently saying that the US has not given specific information and given only general information before the 26 November attack
 videsh sachiv nirupama raav ne kaha tha, ‘pichley kuch maheenon main jab hedli kaa maamla aayaa, hamane jaanch main america adhikariyon ke saath baatcheet kii or jaankaree kaa aadan pradaan kiya
 Before 26 / 11 we had nothing more than very general information about these threats and threats
 ’kuch khabaron ke mutabik hedli kii do patniyon ne mumbai hamalon se kareeb ek saal pehle epabiai ko bataaya tha ki vah lashkar ke saath kaam karte hue bharat main hamalon kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha
 It was told in the news that America did not provide such important information to India, due to which 26

 He had also angered the government by supporting his deputy Rajeshwar Singh
 rajeshwar singh ne rajasav sachiv hasmukh adhiya par 'ghotalebaajon kaa saath dene' kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Karnal also dismissed the RAW report stating that Rajeshwar was in contact with an agent of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI

 ’tendulkar ne kaha ki manipur kii is mukkebaaz ko ucch str kii pratiyogitaaon main bhaag lene kii anumati milani chahie kyonki unhone apane vyavhaar ke liye pehle hi maafee maang lee he

 The veteran batsman said, "the task force should be to stop any possible attempt by the apex body (of boxing) to harm their career by presenting reasonable arguments in defense of Sarita
" yah mahatvapurn he kyonki sarita un khilaadiyon main shaamil he jo desh kaa pratinidhitiv karne main garv mahasoos karte hai or bharat sahit vibhinn sahyogiyon se har tarah ke samarthan kaa hakdaar hai
 Tendulkar urged the minister to take necessary steps

 yah pehla mauka he jab bijepi kaa kendriya netritv kisi rajya main khud ke str par naam tay karne ke baavjood use ghoshit nahin kar paa rahaa he

 They argue that if Gajendra Singh is made the state president, it will be difficult for the BJP to win the assembly elections
 pradesh ke netaaon ko lagata he ki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje bhi rajput hai
 If the state president also becomes Rajput, then the other castes will get angry and it will become difficult for the BJP to win the election

 chidambaram samet kisi bhi netaa ko congress party pramukh banane ke liye chunaav ladane se koi nahin roak rahaa he
 Controversy on this issue has again gained momentum with his comment
 digvijay kii is tippanee ke kuch hi der baad bhaajapa ne yah sawaal kar daalaa ki kya rahul gandhi ke netritv kii prabhaavashiltaa ko lekar congress ke andar hi sawaal uthne lage hai
 Digvijay Singh said, 'chidambaram and any leader outside the Gandhi family have complete freedom to contest the election of party president (post)
 koi unhen roak nahin rahaa
 
 
 Nobody has stopped any non-gandhi from contesting the Congress presidential election
 ' unhone kaha, 'chidambaram chunaav ladane ke liye swatantra hai
 
 
 The Gandhi family has not stopped any non-gandhi from contesting elections
 ' This comment comes at a time when a few days ago the former finance minister said in an interview that a person outside the Gandhi family can become the president of the Congress

 But Shiv Sena is busy in redeeming the name of Balasaheb Thackeray
 pehle shivaji park main unka putala banane kii maang to ab shivaji park kaa naam badal dene kii jid
 But on these issues, the Shiv Sena is seen standing alone, isolated from the other parties
 bombe se mumbai, phir victoria terminus se chhatrapati shivaji terminus, or ab shivaji park se shivatirth
 Shiv Sena is now demanding that Shivaji Park be renamed as Shivatirtha
 darasal, shivasena supremeo bala sahib thakare shivaji park ko isi naam se sambodhit karte the
 But now it is not the tiger's roar nor the strength of the Shiv Sena to pass this proposal without any problem
 congress is prastaav kaa virodh karte hue ye kar rahi he kii shivasena kaa ye prastaav, mumbai ke itihaas ke saath chhedchhad hogi
 Almost every party is opposing this proposal, but the opposition of MNS has surprised other people along with Thackeray family

 The results of the Modi government's efforts to destroy underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's network are now visible
 isi kaa nateeja he ki daaud ab apane puraane dhandhe band kar nae dhandhon main haath aajamaa rahaa he
 The responsibility to completely demolish Don's network of black businesses rests with NSA Ajit Doval
 anderworld don daaud ibrahim par bharat sarkaar nakel kasne kii har koshish karti najar aa rahi hai
 According to sources, in 2015, a team was formed under the leadership of NSA Ajit Doval
 is team main ro, ibi, sibiai, mumbai aties or special cell ke vah adhikari shaamil the, jo kai saalon se daaud se jude maamalon par kaam kar rahe the
 Not only were these fast-paced officers called to Delhi, but some of these officers were ordered to work with Indian ambassadors in different countries
 in sabhi adhikariyon kaa makasad khufia taur par kaam karte hue us desh main faile daaud ke avaidh kaale dhandhon ke bare main jaankaree jutanaa tha
 After this, NSA Ajit Doval and Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the list of Don's black businesses with the governments of the respective countries
 saath hi bharat sarkaar ne don ke sabhi bijness tranjaction par roak lagane kii kavayad shuru kii
 In fact, this was also an important issue in the agenda of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Dubai and many countries of the Middle East
 achaanak shuru hui is muhim se sabase zyada asar don ke hawala kaarobaar par padaa
 When the officials of Ajit Doval's team started giving information about Don's business transactions to the governments there, the banks seized a lot of money on the orders of the government
 sutron ke mutabik, don ke ab tak 500 karod rupaye alag-alag deshon main jabt kiye ja chuke hai
 Let us put in the diamond trade that Dawood has now started trying the illegal diamond trade, a large part of which is also supplied to the traders of Surat in India
 isaki bhanak lagate hi sarkaar ne treders association ke jariye saaf sandesh diya ki aise kisi maamle main hira vyapaariyon kaa naam saamne par unhen koi riyaayat nahin di jaaegi
 Crude oil and arms smuggling, while the government had already put a stop to the illegal business of investing money in Don's real estate and films
 sutron kii maane to daaud ne ab kachche tel or rifinary ke saath-saath avaidh hathiyaaron kii kharid-farokht kaa nayaa dhandha shuru kiya he
 In view of the ever increasing demand for crude oil, Don is now trying his hand in this business
 hathiyaaron kaa dhandhe main don ne talasha munafadi-company ne kachche tel ke kaarobaar se judi kai nami companiyon main apana paisa laga rakhaa he
 Also, Don has kept his special henchmen sitting there to establish their roots in this game of oil
 vahiin duniya bhar main grih-yuddh ke halaaton ko dekhte hue avaidh hathiyaaron kaa dhandha bhi don ke liye munaafe kaa sauda sabit ho rahaa he
 Syrian and ISIS have reached Don Believe the point of information, the d-company not only participated in many defense related deals, but also acquired them

 Frustrated with the loss in the most disappointing tour so far, the Indian cricket team will try to end the tour positively by returning to victory in the five-match ODI series against England starting on Saturday
 bharat ko ab tak ballebaajon kii lagaataar asafalataa or gendbaajon ke lagaataar niraashajanak pradarshan se jujhna padaa he
 He was number one in Test cricket in the world at the start of the tour, but this tour of England was nothing short of a nightmare for him and he has only won three practice matches so far

 In view of England's excellent form and India's slim condition, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his team will have to make extra efforts to dominate the home team with enthusiasm
 england abhi number ek test team he
 He is the defending Twenty20 champion and now his goal is to prove himself in the ODI matches as well
 yadi vah vanade siries main 5-0 se clin sweep karata he, to isisi ranking main australia or srilanka ke baad tisare sthaan par pahunch jayega, jabaki abhi tisare number par kabiz bharat paanchaven sthaan par khisak jayega
 The series is also a chance for England to avenge their 1–5 and 0–5 loss in the last two rounds of the subcontinent
 isse elistare cook ke khilaadi agle maheene paanch vanade ke liye sakaaratmak soch ke saath bharat daure par aaenge
 Indian batting is very strong
 usamen sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid, viraat kohli, rohit sharma, suresh raina, dhoni or ajinkya rahane jaise ballebaaj hai
 While Tendulkar is eagerly awaiting his 100th international century, Dravid will try to make his final ODI series special
 unhone england daure ke baad ekadivasiy cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 However, the series will be a tough test for Kohli, Sharma, Raina and Rahane in the face of a strong England attack
 england ke gendbaaj bhartiya yuva ballebaajon ko pareshaani main daalane ke liye short pich gendon kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 However, the biggest worry for Dhoni is the bowling of the torrent
 praveen kumaar ko chhodkar koi bhi bhartiya gendbaaj abhi tak prabhaav chhodane main naakaam rahaa he
 Munaf Patel may prove to be effective in the death overs, but the rest of the bowlers look ordinary
 paanchaven gendbaaj kii anupasthiti main bharat ko kohli, raina or sharma or se yah jimmedaari puri karwaani hogi
 But it will not be easy for him to stop batsmen like Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, who hit double centuries in Test matches
 yahi nahin england ke madhyakram ke mukhya ballebaaj jonathan traat ne bhi chot se ubarkar vaapasi kar lee he

 Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha alleged in his tweet that Vajpayee was the 'weakest' prime minister as he had failed to protect India's border and the interests of the country in the case of Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki vaajapeyi narendra modi tak ko saadhane main naakaam rahe, jinhen vah 2002 main gujarat dangon ke baad mukhyamantri pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 He tweeted that the weakest prime minister so far was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who wanted to sack Modi over the Gujarat carnage, but succumbed

 If you really want to make a film on the life of Haji Mastan, then i can tell you his real story

 Elections are to be held in UP next year and there is an uproar in Mulayam's clan
 mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav ko party ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataate hue shivpal yadav ko kaman saunp di to siem ne chachaa shivpal se aath ahm vibhaag waapas le liya
 When there was speculation about Shivpal's resignation from the Akhilesh cabinet, he made it clear on Wednesday by press conference that he would follow the orders of Netaji i
e
 SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sapa main sirf ek hi bos hai or wo hai netaji
 CM Akhilesh Yadav also broke the silence on the ruckus created by the news of the conflict in the clan and said that this quarrel is in the government and not in the family
 akhilesh ne bhi kaha ki kuch faisle netaji ke kehane par liye gaye hai, kuch unhone (siem ne) khud liye hai
 In this way, by curbing Shivpal's wishes, Akhilesh has given a clear indication that he wants to establish himself as a leader on the path of development while other party leaders have been doing caste-based politics
 akhilesh janata ke netaa hai or wo party kii image kharaab nahin hone dena chaahate
 Shivpal said five big things at a press conference in Saifai on Wednesday morning
 inke myne kya hai, jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 
 
 1
 jo netaji nirnay lenge, ham uske saath hai
 When the reporters asked Shivpal Yadav if he was going to resign from the Akhilesh cabinet, he said that he would first meet Netaji and he would follow the decision taken by Netaji
 shivpal or akhilesh ke bich chal rahaa shityudh jab sataha par aa gaya to sapa mukhiya ne hi damege control kiya
 Mulayam Singh called Shivpal Yadav's wife and asked for reconciliation between brother and son
 shaayad yah vajah he ki mangalvaar kii ghatana ke baad jo kayaas lagaae ja rahe the, unpar shivpal ne viraam laga diya or kaha ki jaisaa netaji kahenge, vaisaa hi hoga
 2
 sapa or netaji ke saath
 When Shivpal was asked under whose leadership the 2017 assembly elections would be fought, he kept silence over it
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh kii janata netaji or samaajawaadee party ke saath he
 When Shivpal and Mulayam are on one stage, the atmosphere looks pleasant but the distance between Akhilesh and Shivpal is visible on every public stage
 3
 It is the right of the CM to take the ministry
 mulaayam kunbe main yah ghamaasan kaaphi samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 When the SP won the 2012 elections, Mulayam handed over power to his son Akhilesh
 us vakt shivpal khud siem bananaa chaahate the
 After much persuasion, Shivpal agreed but when he came in front of the media he made it clear that Netaji is the Chief Minister
 yani abtak rajya sarkaar kii cabinet main ahm vibhaagon ke mukhiya rahe shivpal ne akhilesh ko kabhi apana siem mana hi nahin
 4
 baaki mantralayon se istife par netaji jo kahenge wo hi karenge
 About four and a half years ago, Shivpal had shown his allegiance to Netaji and even today he continues to maintain his loyalty
 saaf he ki shivpal jo kuch bhi kehete yaa karte hai, usamen mulaayam singh yadav kii sweekruti hoti he
 Otherwise, Shivpal has neither left without Mulayam or will walk forward
 5
 Will serve the public and will not let injustice happen to them
 ab jab upi main chunaav ko mahaj 6 maheene bache hai, mulaayam singh ne sanghathan kii jimmedaari akhilesh se lekar ko de di he
 The SP chief knows that it is necessary to strengthen the organization before going to the polls
 shivpal sanghathan ke netaa hai or party ko sangathit karne ke liye sthaneey str par kaam karte hai

 To this, the AAP had said in a written demand to the Commission that this challenge cannot be accepted without giving an open concession to machine malfunctions

 yahaan tak ki endiemasi adhikariyon ne choti-moti todphod bhi kii thi, lekin conot place ko abhi bhi avaidh kabje se mukti nahin mili he
 Major NDMC officials also believe that it is not easy to remove illegal possession in Connaught Place
 jin dukandaaron ke vahaan notice bheje gaye the unamem se kuch kaa kahana he ki unki vivaadit property 50 saal se zyada puraani he, jiskaa endiemasi ke paas koi record nahin he

 Now looking at the star cast, you are called multistarrer

 You have also done films like 'ishwar' and 'mashal', do you consider yourself as a different actor in the industry? See whenever any other actor is going on the road or somewhere, people call him by his name like Dev is going to Anand, Shah Rukh is going, but i have always been called by the name of 'lakhan', 'munna', 'ishwar' or 'mr
 India'
 kabhi kabhi 'e jhakkaas' bhi bulaate hai
 So everyone has their own style

 So those things hurt you? At that time, it felt bad, it was very bad
 'lamhe' ke dauraan jab main apni much nikaal rahaa tha to hamanefilmacitimen press ko bulaayaa tha lekin koi aayaa hi nahin
 Nobody was bothered
 lekin aajkal unhi baton ko tavajjo di jaati he
 Now i feel good
 aapane ek taraf dilip kumaar ke saath kaam kiya he to aaj yang actors ke saath bhi kar rahe hai, ye parivartan kaise dekhte hai?yang old kuch nahin hota, sirf tallent kaam aata he
 There are so many young people who do not know anything
 joyakaphi talented he isliye kaam kar rahaa hum
 i always adapt myself to the character according to my need
 kabhi byopic kaa hissaa bananaa chahenge?kahani acchhee hogi to jarur karuunga, kisi kii bhi nahin kar luungaa
 If there is some good product and story, i will do it in the coming days
 philhal aisa kuch sochaa nahin he
 The film also features the pet dog 'pluto Mehra', are you an animal lover? i am not an animal lover but i definitely have children
 aisa nahin he kii main nirdayee hum bas manenimalsako dekhnaa pasand karata hum
 Have you ever had a script that you have to remove a mustache, will you get your mustache cut? No, not now, i think i will not remove it at this time

 unka maananaa he ki in chunaavon (elections 2019) main bijepi (BJP) ko jeet milegi
 And for this he blames West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, BSP supremo Mayawati
 Mamta Deedi didn't do # gathbandhan with other parties coz she wants to win more seats to become PM of India
 Mayawati also did not do # Gathbandhan with congress in UP coz she also Wants to become PM
 And BJP will win more seats coz of These 2 women
 They are supporting Modi Ji
 kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ke mutabik mamata banerjee ne anya partiyon se gathbandhan nahin kiya kyonki vah zyada siten jitkar pradhanmantri bananaa chaahati hai
 BSP chief Mayawati did not tie up with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh because she too wants to become the country's prime minister
 or bijepi (BJP) in do mahilaon kii vajah se zyada seat jeetne main kaamyaab ho jaaegi
 Because she is supporting Modi ji (PM Modi)
 gaur ho ki KRK in dinon lagaataar chunaavon ko lekar apni raay rakh rahe hai
 Kamal r Khan had earlier also targeted Mayawati and alleged that Mayawati had not aligned with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh under any intention
 yaheen nahin vah piem modi (PM Modi)=ko bhi kai baar nishane par le chuke hai

 In Uttarakhand's panchayat elections, now only two children and educated candidates will be able to fight
 rajya sarkaar ne iske liye panchayatiraj (sanshodhan) adhinium 2019 ko buudhvaar ko paarit kar diya he
 In this way, candidates with more than 2 children will not be able to contest in the upcoming Panchayat elections

 is sanshodhan vidheyak ke anusaar, uttarakhand main pachaayat chunaav ladane ke liye saamaanya jati ke ummidavaaron ko dasvin kaksha uteern hona aavashyak hoga
 Whereas for women and men belonging to scheduled castes and tribes, this qualification will have to pass the eighth grade
 anusuchit jati or janajati kii mahilaon ke liye panchayat chunaav ladane hetu pachavin kaksha uteern hona jaruri hoga
 According to the Panchayati Raj Amendment Bill, people who have more than two children and one of them is born after 300 days from the date of the coming into force of this provision, also cannot contest elections
 vidheyak ke mutabik panchayat kaa koi bhi pratinidhi ek saath do pad dhaaran nahin kar sakegaa
 If the name of a member is removed from the electoral roll of the area concerned, then the person concerned will no longer be the head and member of the panchayat
 bataa den ki uttrakhand main kareeb 50 hajaar panchayat pratinidhi chune jate hai
 Barring Haridwar alone, the term of the remaining panchayats in Uttarakhand ends in July
 iske chalate chunaav ab sitambar main ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, after the enactment of the Panchayati Raj Amendment Bill, many people will not be able to contest this election
 panchayat pramukh padon par aarakshan kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he
 In these, there will be a provision for reservation on the posts of village head, area panchayat head and district panchayat president
 in padon ko anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or pichde varg ke liye bhi arakshit kiya ja sakegaa
 The upcoming panchayat elections can be held on the basis of the new amended bill

 Premium charges apply !! Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja believes that if India manages to win the second Test starting in Mumbai on Friday, then they can avenge the 0-4 defeat they got last year by 'brownwashing' England
 
 unhone kaha ki mumbai main spinneron ko adhik turn milegaa or aise main england ke liye halaat or mushkil ho sakate hai jinke ‘ballebaaj maansik rup se majboot hone ke baavjood takneekee taur par thodaa kamjor hai
 "rameez said," India can win all the matches of the series
 mujhe lagata he ki mumbai main gend adhik turn legi
 The Ahmedabad pitch did not have the pace (pace) for the spinners
 aap kisi bhi spinner se puuchhie use spin karaane ke liye pes kii jarurat hoti he
 This gives a little more turn
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar england mumbai test haar jaataa he to bharat ke liye maidan saaf ho jayega
 India will then have a golden opportunity to win 4–0, which we call Brownwash
 ’ramij ne haalanki bharat ko aagaah kiya ki kisi bhi tarah kii dhilaayi usko baari pad sakati he
 He said, 'india have a heavy upper hand but England will compete
 aapane pehla test match dekha hoga
 The way he made a comeback in it, the match became exciting
 ek samay yah nahin lag rahaa tha ki koun jitegaa yaa match dra hoga
 It seems that the series will be interesting
 ’ramij ne bharat ke yuva khilaadiyon visheshkar cheteshwar pujaara kii jamkar tarif kii jinhone pehle test match kii pehali pari main naabad 206 or duusari pari main naabad 41 ran banaakar main aaf da match puraskaar hasil kiya
 According to Rameez Raza, 'pujara played a great innings
 england kii team takneekee rup main kamjor he lekin dimagi taur par majboot he
 If you score close to 250 against this team without being dismissed, then i would say that after a long time, there has been such a batsman who has so much confidence
 ’ramij ne kaha ki pujaara kii rahul dravid se tulana karnaa acchhee nahin hogi
 He said, 'he is more compared to Dravid
 dravid camentry karte hue khud mujh se bol rahe the ki jab vah pujaara kii umr ke the tab unamem bhi itnaa aatmavishvaas nahin tha jitna usamen he
 "he said," This is India's real victory that he has brought new blood to cricket so that you forget the old players
 hamane dekha ki umesh yadav par zyada logon kii nigahen thi or jahir khan par kam
 Similarly, Pujara and Virat Kohli had their eyes fixed on them
 ye nayi peedi ke noujvaan he or unka pradarshan utsahjanak he
 Rameez said that the teams of the subcontinent should have their 'A' and Under-19 teams constantly tour abroad to perform well abroad
 apane jamaane ke is kalatmak ballebaaj ne kaha, ‘apni aaraamdey jagah chhodkar mushkil bhare halaat main khelnaa hi test cricket kii asli chunauti he
 Each team has a cycle
 mujhe lagata he ki har team kaa paanch saal kaa chakra hota he
 After this, his performance is affected due to many reasons
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jis team kaa gharelu dhaancha majboot hota he unki giravat jaldi niyantran main aa jaati he
 Teams in the subcontinent receive more attention because they beat the teams at home badly while coming under pressure abroad
 prashansak bhi un par dabaav banaate hai
 i think more and more visits of 'A' teams and Under-19 teams should be done to diagnose this
