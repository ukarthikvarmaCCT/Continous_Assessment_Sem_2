 Police has arrested a young man in this case
 aapako bataa den ki police kaa maananaa he ki yah hatya mahaj gaali se naaraaz hokar kii gai he
 In this case a report of missing child was reported
 bachche ke pita or parivaar do din se bachche ko dhund rahaa tha
 Upon investigation, the deadbody of the child was found in a neighboring house
 is makaan se jab kaaphi badboo aa rahi thi to logon or police ne makaan kii jaanch kii
 The child's kibdiota was inserted inside the sack
 yah makaan khaali tha
 Police reached the spot and sent the dead body for postmortem
 disipi romil bania ne phone par bataaya ki is maamle main ek yuvak ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 It was revealed that he was newly married
 uski patni ke saamne uski gaali dekar beijjati hui thi
 He was angry with this and seeing the opportunity, he murdered the child
 acha bhi lagata he ki log is kaabil samajhate hai ki musiibat ke vakt phone karne lagate hai
 i feel bad that i am not able to work for everyone
 dil par pathar rakhte hue is number ko ab band karne ke alaava koi rasta nahin he
 Every phone call gets depressed anew
 akhir ek ke baad ek is tarah kii baton ko sunakar kaise khush rahe
 Sometimes time goes into refusal and also gets annoyed
 vaise to saamaanya or sanyamit rahete hue sun letaa hum lekin afsos is baat kaa he ki hamaare system ke sitam se kab mukti milegi
 There is an army of millions of officers
 vidhayak, saansad se lekar na jane anginat log hai jo janata kii seva kaa daawa karte hai magar janata kii seva kahin nahin ho rahi he
 In the afternoon, an ex-serviceman got a call
 railway ke group di main physical test kii sharton ko lekar shikaayat kar rahe the
 There was a loud voice coming from there
 lag rahaa tha ki aakhri din he
 My news will probably change the terms
 aisa hota nahin kabhi
 The jawan, who retired from the Air Force, said that he had to complete the 1-kilometer run in 4 minutes and 15 seconds
 18 saal ke noujvaan or sena ke ritair 45 saal ke jawan ke liye ek samaan paimaana banaaya gaya
 Whereas in the Army itself, when there is a physical test, there is a relaxation in time according to age
 18 saal or 45 saal vaala kaise 4 minute 15 second kii daud main barabari kar saktaa he
 The thing seemed right for this ex-serviceman
 magar maine vaada kiya ki fasebuk par likh detaa hum
 Think of it as my main news-work
 jawan ne sainik prashikshan kii shaleenta dikhaai or kaha ki wo bhi chalegaa
 At least they will not regret that no one has known their problem
 isi tarah kuch phone aae jinhen samajhane main kaaphi vakt lag gaya
 Facing specific physical challenges, the candidates wanted to reach out to the Railway Minister
 ye bhi railway ke group di ke parikshaarthi hai
 They say that when the vacancy came, only a few seats were reserved for the disabled in the board
 sabase adhik seat ahmedabad main thi
 There was no seat on any board
 saare viklang ummidavaaron ne unheen board kaa chayan kiya jahaan seat thi
 About 70 percent of the students chose the Ahmedabad board
 ab hua ye he ki board ne ahmedabad kii siten kam kar di hai
 This has led to more candidates in the ratio of fewer seats
 viklang ummidavaaron ko lagata he ki ab unki naukari chali jaaegi
 Railways made this change in terms so that they did not have to give jobs
 ye ummidavaar chaahate hai ki inhen board salect karne kaa mauka dobaaraa se diya jaae taaki jahaan siten baad main di gai hai vahaan unhen farm bharne kaa mauka mili
 Normalization is a mess
 railway ne press release main narmalizeshan kii prakriya ko vishwasaneey bataaya he
 Railways should explain the candidates in even more detail
 narmalizeshan kii samaj banani bahut zaruri he
 This will only benefit the railways
 ummidavaaron kaa uski pariksha pranali main bharosa badhegaa
 i still say hamaare yuva apane swaarth se upar uthen
 They have seen every test
 har system ko aazamaa liya he
 The persecuted students of all the examinations should now contact each other
 apane maa-baap ko bhi sangharsh main shaamil karen
 First of all, tell your parents not to watch TV in free time and read the book
 unka padhanaa-likhnaa saadhe baees ho chukaa he
 After the job, you do not read even a book and do not read newspapers carefully
 gapp aise haankate hai jaise desh chalaa rahe hon
 Youngsters also read themselves a lot
 aise jaagruk logon kaa ek network banaaen
 Gandhi, read Ambedkar and on the strength of moral force, on the basis of self-sacrifice, try to change the system extensively
 varna unki har ladaai akhbaar ke kisi kone main chhapane or ek news channel ke ek program main dikhne tak simit rah jaaegi
 i have been involved in the problem of these youth for two years
 inaki raajnneetik samaj kii gunvattta se kaaphi niraashaa hui he
 Now they are responsible for their problem
 bahut dukh hota he
 How upset they are
 unka vot sabko chahie
 Nobody is listening to them

 With this, the death toll in rain related incidents in Uttarakhand has increased to 24
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne uttarakhand main baari barishon ke kaaran hui mauton par dukh jaahir kiya he or mritkon ke pariwaron ke prati samvednaa jaahir kii he
 a police officer said, 'the incident took place in the Kathbangla area of the city around 2 am
 barish ke chalate pahaado par bhuskhalan hua or malba teen makaanon ke upar aa gira
 Rajpur Shah, in-charge of Rajpur police station, said seven bodies, including the body of a woman, have been recovered from the rubble of the houses

 He said that a woman who was seriously injured in this accident has been admitted to Doon Hospital
 thana prabharee ne kaha ki makaanon ke malbe main kisi anya shav ke fansaa hone kii ashanka nahin he
 In Pauri, Dehradun and Pithoragarh districts of the state, 17 people died in separate incidents on Friday due to rain
 aksar aisa hota he ki ham bazaar se darjan ke bhav main andey kharid laate hai lekin unhen ek din main to khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa or ve kharaab hone lagate hai
 Many times, eggs kept in the fridge for a long time can also be feared
 haalanki frij main rakhe andey kaaphi dinon tak surakshit rahete hai lekin is baat kii guarantee to koi nahin le saktaa he ki bazaar se jitne bhi andey lekar aae hai ve sabhi sahi hon
 In such a situation, it is important to identify bad eggs
 andey kii freshnes kii jaanch kar lenaa isliye bhi jaruri he kyonki kharaab andey ke seven se kai tarah kii bimaariyaan ho sakati he auraswasthya kharaab ho saktaa he
 For this, there are some common remedies that you can identify by adopting the right egg
 upaay number 1
 There is an air pocket inside at each end of each egg, immersed in water
 jab anda fresh hota he to yah air pocket choti hoti he or andey ke puraane yaa kharaab hone par yah badi ho jaati he
 With the help of this air pocket you can check the freshness of eggs
 chaude munh vaale ek gilaas main pani bhar len
 Leave the glass empty enough so that the water does not fall out when the egg is poured into it
 ab andey ko pani se bhare gilaas main daal dijie
 If the egg is horizontal and sits down, it means it is absolutely fresh
 agar horigental hote hue bhi yah halkaa uthaa hua he to iskaa matlab he ki vah thodaa purana ho chukaa he
 But if the egg starts to float in the water, then know that it is spoiled
 air pocket bad jane kii vajah se anda halkaa ho jaataa he or upar aakar tairne lagata he
 Measure number 2
 phodkar dekhnugar aap chahen to andey ko phodkar bhi dekh sakate hai ki yah kitna fresh he or kitna purana
 If the egg is fresh, when you break it and place it in a plate, you will see three colors and two rings
 ring aap aise dekhen - ek gadha pilaa bhaag, uske baad ek kriim color kaa thodaa bada ring or ant main aapako andey kaa safed bhaag najar aayega
 If the egg is old then you will see the same thick yellow and cream colored ring

 Shastri was then made the team director
 shastri ne iespien crickinfo se kaha, meraa kaam sab kuch dekhnaa he

 Asked if this would affect Fletcher's status, Shastri said, absolutely not

 He said, this is a crucial time for Indian cricket
 jab mujhase poocha gaya, to maine iske bare main sochaa or haa kah di
 The state of Indian cricket is such that i knew that i could contribute

 The important thing is to contribute
 shastri ne kaha, yadi main aaj yahaan hum, to bisisiai kii vajah se
 As a junior cricketer, he gave me a platform to play for the state and then a chance to play for the country
 yah poochne par ki kya niyukti ke baad unki flechar yaa captain mahendra singh dhoni se baat hui he, shastri ne kaha, maine mangalvaar ko unke saath do ghante bitaye
 We talked about the current situation and measures for improvement
 yah poochne par ki test siries main bharat kii haar kii vajah kya rahi, shastri ne anubhavheenata ko doshi tehraaya
 He said, if you compare the test matches played by this XI with the teams on those tours where we played poorly, at least we won one test here
 shastri ne kaha, hamane 1974 main ek bhi test nahin jeeta or pichley daure par bhi yahaan hamaara safaya hua, jabaki team main kai bade naam the
 If you look at the total number of Test matches played by the players of this team and the test matches played by the teams who have visited here in the past, then there will be a difference of ground sky
 unhone kaha, is daure par maine videsh daure par bharat kii mahanatam jeet dekhi
 i know this because i did not see such a pitch and such an inexperienced team won it
 pichley teen test main maine unhen ridhhin cricket bhi khelte dekha

 raipur main anna hajaare ne kaha he ki wo jald hi modi sarkaar ke khilaaf jan andolan khadaa karenge
 He said, 'it has been three and a half years to the new government at the Center, yet the Lokpal has not been appointed till now'
 'vyakti yaa party ke khilaaf nahin'is elaan ke saath hi anna ne ye bhi saaf kar diya ki vah kisi vyakti ke khilaaf nahin hai
 However, delay in appointment of Lokpal is not acceptable
 anna ne ye bhi saaf kiya ki unhone kabhi kisi raajnneetik dal ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan nahin kiya
 Anna said, 'I have always raised my voice in the national interest'
 'desh kii arthvyavastha bigadi'anna hajaare ne lokapal ke alaava desh kii arthvyavastha par bhi tippanee kii
 Anna said that the country's economy is deteriorating every day

 After which he said to raise the issue of Jan Lokpal again
 anna ne ye bhi kaha tha unke aagaamee andolan main vahi log hissaa len, jinhen bhavishya main raajnneetik dal main na janaa ho
 For this, he has asked those involved in the movement to ask for affidavit

 Hyderabad, the new T20 League 6 team, regained the top spot in the table after defeating Punjab by five wickets thanks to a stormy innings by young Hanuma Vihari, a tactical and all-rounder by Tisara Perera, after a disciplined performance by the bowlers

 sarkaar ne kaha he ki 15 lakh rupee tak ke kam laagat vaaleavas rin par ek pratishat kii byaaj sabsididi jaaegi, taaki is tarah ke awaason kii maang badhai ja sake
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a budget speech in Parliament that he is further liberalizing the existing scheme of one percent interest subsidy on housing loans up to Rs 15 lakh
 is yojana ke tahat makaan kii laagat 25 lakh rupee se adhik nahin honi chahie
 Under the existing interest subsidy scheme, this facility is given on a loan up to ten lakh rupees and the cost of the house should be 20 lakh rupees
 mukherjee ne kaha ki awasaiya kshetra kii vruddhi ko gati dene ke liye yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), with the announcement of its monetary policy on April 5, 2018, again issued a warning regarding virtual currency (VC) transactions like bitcoin, that its transactions are risky and banks are trading at their level Do not allow payment for aise aadesh pehle bhi arabiai de chukaa he lekin hakeekat ye he ki usne bitcoin len-dein ko avaidh ghoshit nahin kiya he
 There is a lot of confusion at the level of the government and RBI about VC, which has also led to confusion among the people
 sarkaar desh kii virtual karency bhi laana chaahati he lekin bazaar ke maujuuda kaarobaar par chetavanee bhi jari kar rahi he
 The government is suffering the opposite of confusion
 arabiai ke daayre main aane vaale vittiya sansthaanon ko virtual karency ke len-dein ke liye bhugtan na karne ko kaha gaya he or is sambandh main vistrut guideline aane vaali he
 But VC exchanges are still in operation in the country
 ahmedabad ke sibar security export or apana isio (initial coin ofring) laane ja rahe manan shah kaa kahana he ki visi len-dein ke log duusare tareeke nikaal lenge
 Dealing in cash and hawala is expected to increase
 aisa hua to sarkaar ko abhi 18 percent tex kharid-farokht par mil rahaa he vah bhi nahin milegaa
 Actually, the government is very cautious about currency
 vah mudra par apana niyantran khatm yaa kam nahin hone dena chaahati
 If the virtual currency came in and the transaction started from that, then the government's interference in the value of the currency would stop
 lekin sarkaar virtual karency laana bhi chaahati he kyonki ye suvidhajanak or kifayati he
 It also has many advantages
 rigerv bank ne iske liye ek samooh kaa gathan kiya he jo is saal june tak report degaa
 Earlier this report was supposed to come by March
 agar sarkari virtual karency aegi to jaahir he vah rupye ke baraabar kii hi hogi or usase bhugtan kaa puraa seen badal jayega
 On the other hand, the contradiction between global VC like Bitcoin to pull out and bring your VC is incomprehensible
 sarkaar ke str par virtual karency ko lekar spashtataa na hone kaaran bhram kii sthiti ban rahi he
 This is not only in India, except for a few countries, all the governments of the world are in a similar mood regarding VC

 *** do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aaropee italy ke donon nausainik bharat laut rahe hai
 In Parliament, Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid has said that he will not be punished
 aaropee italy ke do nausainikon ke bharat lautne ke liye supreme court kii samay seemaa shuukravaar ko khatm ho rahi he
 Both naval special aircraft will reach India by 10 am on Friday
 isi ke saath bharat kii yah badi kootnithik jeet hui he
 The Italian government has said that it will send two of its marines facing charges of killing two Indian fishermen back to India
 italy kaa yah elaan uske videsh mantralay ke pehle ke faisle se thik ulat he jisamen kaha gaya tha ki donon aaropee nausainik bharat waapas nahin bheje jaaenge
 It is noteworthy that both the marines, named Massimiliano Latour and Salvatore Zirone, were allowed to go home to vote in the Italian elections but on condition that they would return to India by 22 March to face trial
 pichley saal farvari main donon marinon ne kerala ke samudr tat ke paas do machuaaron kii kathith taur par goli markar hatya kar di thi
 Italy argues that during an international anti-piracy operation, bullets were fired in the international waters and therefore Italy should have jurisdiction in this matter
 isse pehle congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne italy par apane gusse kaa izhaar karte hue kaha tha ki italy ko do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke aaropee apane do nausainikon ko lekar supreme court se kiya gaya vaada puraa karnaa chahie
 Sonia said this to the party mps in the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting
 supreme court ne 14 march ko kaha tha ki italy ke rajdoot uski anumati ke bagaiyr desh chhodkar nahin ja sakate
 In another order issued on Monday, the court asked the administration to ensure that Italian Ambassador Daniel Mensini does not leave the country
 supreme court kaa aadesh italy dwaara apane nau sainikon ko bharat bhejne se inkaar kiye jane ke baad aayaa tha, jinke khilaaf yahaan do bhartiya machuaaron kii hatya ke silsile main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 The court allowed the nine accused accused to go to their country for general elections
 tab bharat main italy ke rajdoot mensini ne court ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki aaropee nausainik chunaav main bhaag lene ke baad yahaan laut aaenge
 But Italy denied this last week

 saujany:newsflicks 'puri chhod khan half khani, pan mewar quitting kathei ni jani' i
e
 even if you leave half the whole and eat only half, but leave Mewar and go nowhere
 
 
 
 This is the saying of Mewar
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne mewar se apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii he
 The reason behind this is that whenever he started the election journey from Mewar, he returned to power in Rajasthan
 yah yatra kareeb 40 din chalegi
 If BJP President Amit Shah was present during the beginning of this journey, PM Modi will be present on the occasion of its completion
 dakshin rajasthan main sthit ajey bhoomi mewar kaa rajasthan kii raajnneeti main alag hi mahatv he
 It is said that the road to power in Rajasthan passes through Mewar
 jo mewar jeetta he, vahi rajasthan par raaj karata he
 This was not only the modern democratic concept, Mewar was also the center of power of medieval Rajputana (in present day Rajasthan)
 itihaas ke tathy talaashen or mewar ke shoorveer shaasha maharana pratap kii baat karen, to mughal badshaah akbar bhi sari koshishen karne ke baavjood ant tak mewar ko jeet nahin paae
 Maharana Pratap did not give up and Akbar could not defeat Maharana Pratap
 lihaaja akbar ne puraa dhyaan dilli par kendrit kar liya
 Important from the strategic point of view, the historical fort of Rajasthan - Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh is located in Mewar
 mewar kaa itihasrajasthand mewar samrajya parakramee gahaloton kii bhoomi rahaa he, jinka apana itihaas he
 To protect his motherland, religion, culture, the valor of Gehlot has left an indelible mark on Mewar
 mewar main lambey samay tak rajputon kaa shashan rahaa
 Later the Muslim invaders caused considerable damage to the heritage here
 khilji vansh ke shaasha allaudin khilji ne saal 1303 main gahalot shaasha rawal ratan singh ko parajeet kar ise dilli sultanate kaa hissaa bana liya
 At the same time, Hammirdev of Sisodia dynasty, a branch of the Gehlot dynasty, conquered Chittor in the time of Muhammad Tughlaq and liberated the whole of Mewar
 saal 1431 main rana kumbha mewar ke raaj singhaasana par virajman hue
 During the times of Rana Kumbha and Rana Sanga, the power of Mewar was at its height, but due to continuous external invasions, the extent of territory in the state expansion kept changing
 rana kumbha ne rajsamand main samrik drushtikon se majboot abhedya durg kumbhalgarh kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 But Rana Kumbha, who could not defeat anyone, was killed by his own son Uday Singh in the year 1473
 rajputon ke virodh ke kaaran udai singh adhik dinon tak shashan nahin kar paae
 Uday Singh was succeeded by his younger brother Rajmal for 36 years
 saal 1509 main rajmal kii mrityu ke baad unke putr rana sangram singh athwa rana sanga mewar kii gaddi par baithe
 Rana Sanga fought wars against Delhi, Malwa, Gujarat during his reign, but was defeated by the Mughal emperor Babur in the Battle of Khanwa in 1527
 haldi ghati kaa yudhmugal badshaah akbar ne saal 1624 main mewar par akraman kar chittod ko gher liya
 But Rana Udai Singh did not accept the subjection of Akbar and moved there making Udaipur his capital near the ancient Adhatpur
 unke baad maharana pratap ne bhi yuddh jari rakhaa or akbar kii adheenta sweekaar nahin kii
 The battle of Akbar and Maharana Pratap is famous in history as the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ne kumbhalmer durg se bhi maharana pratap ko khaded diya or mewar par anek akraman karwaae, lekin maharana ne adheenta sweekaar nahin kii
 Finally, after the year 1642, Akbar shifted his focus to other states and Maharana Pratap regained his position
 saal 1654 main chownd main unki mrityu ho gai
 After Maharana Pratap, his son Rana Amarsingh also resisted the Mughals, but in the end he made a treaty with the Mughal ruler Jahangir and sent his prince Rana Karna Singh to the Mughal court, but Maharana himself entered the court like other kings
 did not accept
 rana karnasingh ke baad se udaipur tab tak mewar kii sthaayee rajdhani rahaa, jab tak ki rana bhoopal singh dwaara 18 april 1948 main raajapootaana kaa bharat main vilay nahin kar diya gaya
 The political history of Mewar is five tribal seats and eight districts in tribal dominated Mewar
 vidhansabha ke lihaaj se mewar main 28 siten hai, jinamein 19 siten anusuchit janajati or anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hai
 Administratively this area is known as Udaipur division, which includes - Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand, Pratapgarh, Banswara, Dungarpur, Bhilwara, Sirohi district
 aazaadee ke baad desh main rajtantr khatm hokar loktantr sthapit hua or raajapootaana rajasthan main tabdeel ho gaya, lekin aadhunik rajasthan ke siyasatdan ne mewar ko hi apni karmbhumi mana or iske mahatv ko kam nahin hone diya, kyonki ve jaanate the ki mewar ke bina jaipur par raaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 While Mewar has dominated Rajasthan's political history, its leaders have always dominated Rajasthan's politics
 congress ke diggaj netaa seepi joshi or girija vyas mewar se hi aate hai
 From Mohanlal Sukhadia to Haridev Joshi, Shiv Charan Mathur, Hiralal Devpura and Gulabchand Kataria have had a significant impact in Rajasthan politics
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki haridev joshi, mohan laal sukhadiya or ashok gahalot ko mukhyamantri pad tak pahunchane main mewar ne kitna yogadan diya
 If we look at the results of the elections going on since 1952, then the Congress was heavy
 rajya main sarvaadhik shashan karne vaale mukhyamantri rahe mohanlal sukhadiya kii karmbhumi mewar rahi
 On the other hand, Haridev Joshi gave political identity to Vagad by becoming the Chief Minister
 beete kuch varshon main aisa siyaasi ubaal dekhne ko mila ki yahaan camel ne panje ko peeche chhod diya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh took steps to establish itself among the forest dwellers in tribal areas
 baad main jansangh or bijepi ne sanghathan khadaa kiya
 After all, what makes Mewar so important in the 200-seat assembly with 28 seats? The politicians of Rajasthan know very well that Rana gives Pratap's land, tearing it down, but when he withdraws, he takes away everything
 saal 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kaa mewar se supada saaf ho gaya or 28 main 26 siten bijepi ke khate main aa gai
 Similarly, in the 2008 assembly elections, the Congress got 22 out of 28 seats in Mewar and Ashok Gehlot became CM with victory in 96 seats
 saal 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main paanchon sansadeey seat congress ke khate main thim, to vahiin saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle isse vipareet parinaam dekhne ko mili
 This shows that Mewar never gave a mixed majority to anyone, when it was clear
 isiilie mewar se niklaa raajnneetik sandesh puure rajasthan main parilakshith hota he
 Once again, political politics in Rajasthan is over and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has started the campaign by taking blessings from Charbhuja Nath Temple in Mewar
 lekin sthaneey jaankaron or vishleshkon kii maane to is baar vasundhara raaje kii dagar aasaan nahin he

 The government says that 15,000 people will be evacuated

 sadakon ko khaali kar diya gaya
 The names of the cities were changed
 itihaas kii kitaab main yah bhi likhaa jayega taaki peediyaan yaad rakh saken
 That the world had closed its borders when Syria needed help, its people were seeking shelter
 aleppo kaa koi ek sach nahin he

 Both the US and Russia superpowers are fighting each other in the name of fighting terror
 asad kii jeet ke liye aleppo zaruri he magar paanch saal kii kavayad ke baad bhi islamic state kaa vajood ab bhi kaayam he
 The question is whether it is a war or is there a game going on in the name of Jung
 samrajyavaadee takaton ke is khel ko aatankwaad se ladane ke naam par khelaa ja rahaa he
 The UN Security Council is also a thing
 isaki bhoomika kya he
 It is written in the news that whenever a proposal comes against war and genocide, Russia vetos
 baaki duniya khamosh rah jaati he
 The United Nations says that more than 80 civilians died
 syria or rus kii sarkaar kahati he ki ye khabar galat he
 Some say 50,000 people are stranded
 koi kahata he ek lakh log fanse hue hai
 The government says that 15,000 people will be evacuated
 vidrohi kehete hai ki sirf ghayal hi baahar bheje jaaenge
 Terrorist groups are also killing civilians and superpowers coming to fight terrorists
 is yuddh ke kawarej main patrakarita kii giravat bhi ek pahalu he
 There is propaganda from every side

 Even in this storm, think of those brave doctors who are there to save their lives
 tippaniyan The strange tragedy is that of the city of Aleppo
 vyapaarik rajdhani kaha jaataa he
 Turks, Iranians, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs have all lived here
 jab arab spring ke dauraan syria ke raashtrapati bashar al asad sarkaar ke khilaaf puure desh main virodh pradarshan shuru hua to qareeb saal bhar aleppo shant hi rahaa

 Russia's government agency Tas has said that people are being evacuated from the rebel-held area

 Someone has written and it is being shared widely that since 1839 Syria has been opening its doors to refugees
 1914 main arminiya ke sharnaarthiyon ko jagah di
 In 1967 Palestine refugees were accommodated
 1990 main kuwait ke sharnaarthi aae to 2003 main iraq ke sharnaarthi
 Syria opened the doors for refugees from Lebanon in 2006
 yah itihaas kii kitaab main likhaa jayega ki syria ne kabhi apane darvaaze unke liye band nahin kiye jo panaah maang rahe the unhen tambuon main nahin rakhaa balki apane gharon ke darvaaze unke liye khole
 The roads were cleared
 shaharon ke naam badal diye gaye
 It will also be written in the history book so that generations can remember it
 yahi ki jab syria ko madad kii zarurat thi, uske log panaah maang rahe the to duniya ne apni simaaon ko band kar diya tha
 Aleppo has no one truth
 virodhiyon kii barbarta kam nahin he
 The genocide of the government is no less

 If they are just terrorists then where are the resources coming from them
 america or rus donon mahashaktiyon ke kheme aatank se ladane ke naam par ek-duusare se lard rahe hai
 Aleppo is necessary for Assad's victory, but even after five years of practice, the Islamic State still exists
 sawaal he ki kya yah jang he yaa jang ke naam par koi khel chal rahaa he
 This game of imperialist forces is being played in the name of fighting terrorism
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad bhi ek chiz he
 What is its role khabaron main likhaa he ki jab bhi yuddh or narsanhaar ke khilaaf koi prastaav aata he rus vito kar detaa he
 The rest of the world remains silent

 The government of Syria and Russia say that this news is incorrect
 koi kahata he ki 50,000 log fanse hue hai
 Some say one lakh people are stranded
 sarkaar kahati he ki 15 hazaar aam log nikaale jaaenge
 The rebels say that only the wounded will be sent out
 nagarikon ko aatankwaadi gut bhi maar rahe hai or aatankwaadiyon se ladane aa rahi mahashaktiyaan bhi maar rahi hai
 The decline of journalism is also an aspect in the coverage of this war
 har taraf se propeganda he
 Everyone has their own truth, but nobody has anything to do with the innocent children being killed

 With the discontinuation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes, the problems of the general public are constantly increasing
 notebandi ke baad bank khulne ke lagaataar chauthe din yani ravivaar ko bhi puraane note badalane yaa unhen jamaa karaane, nakadi nikasi ke liye bainkon or atm ke baahar lambii kataren lagi raheen
 Actually, due to the holiday on Sunday, banks and atms are getting more crowded
 log tadake 4 baje se qatari main aakar khadey hone lage
 People say that money is needed and now only 500 and 1000 old notes are left in the house, it is necessary to change it so that the expenses of the house can run, so have been standing in the line since morning
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki wo somvaar ko daftar kaise jaaenge, ye samasya saamne khadi he, aaj agar paise nahin badale to kal daftar janaa sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 Therefore, today has decided to spend the entire day in withdrawing money from the bank
 kataron main khadey kuch logon ne bankkarmchaariyon kii prashansabhi kii, is bheed main wo logon kii madad main jute hai
 The Congress is providing tea and water to the people standing in queues outside the banks to help them
 desh ke duusare hisson main bhi yahi sthiti he
 People stand in line from morning to evening so that money can be changed
 kai jagahon se avyavashtha kii bhi khabaren ai hai
 Bank employees are also losing their sweat in dealing with this situation
 kai branch to pichley dinon raat 10 baje tak khule rahe, taaki logon kii samasyaayein kam ho
 At the same time, people say that the new notes of 2000 rupees are being received from the bank, it is difficult to spend, there is no agreement to open such a big note, because small notes of 500 and 1000 are closed
 The 100 rupee note is not enough in the market to solve people's problems
 bank karmchaariyon se bhide logauttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar sujaru gaanv main puraane noton ko nae noton se badalane ke dauraan bank karmchaariyon par patharav karne or unase jhagada karne ke liye 100 se zyada logon par maamla darj kiya gaya
 According to the police, three people, including a woman, have been injured due to a fight between people gathered outside the bank to convert old notes into new ones
 unhone bataaya ki ghatana kii soochna milane ke baad police ne maukey par pahunchakar naaraaz logon ko teetar-bitar kiya,gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne aaj ravivaar ko chuttee ke din bhi deshbhar ke sabhi bainkon ko khulaa rakhane kaa nirdesh jari kiya he
 At the same time, there have been reports of clashes between women lying in line outside the bank in Patna, Bihar
 line main khadey logon ke sabar kaa baandh ab tuutata ja rahaa he
 However, it has been said that it will take 2 to 3 weeks for the situation to normalize from the government

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is sitting on a dharna accusing this CBI action of adopting a dictatorial attitude on the Narendra Modi government at the Center
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadav or diemke saansad kanimojhi unase milane kolkata pahunche
 So in the national capital Delhi too, the big leaders of the opposition met
 vipakshi netaaon kii is baithak main andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu, ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar, neshnal conference ke netaa faruk abdulla or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal maujuud rahe
 Giving information about this, Sharad Pawar said that the opposition discussed three issues in this meeting
 jisamen krishi sankat, berogari or sansthaaon par hamale par baat hui
 He said that what happened in West Bengal, the opposition will discuss this issue on Tuesday and the strategy will be decided further
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri or tidipi ke mukhiya chandrababu naidu ne kaha ki pashchim bengal main jo hua uski ham sabhi ne ninda kii he
 Now on Tuesday we will sit once again and take a collective decision on this issue
 yah puche jane par ki is baithak main congress kyon nahin shaamil hui naidu ne kaha ki unhone khud is bare main sharad pavaar se poocha tha
 He told that it was a courtesy call and no one was told about this meeting
 mangalvaar ko hone vaali baithak main congress netritv shaamil hoga
 Significantly, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's reaction against the cbi's action has united all opposition parties
 ravivaar ko der shaam hui ghatana ke baad tamaam netaa-rahul gandhi, chandrababu naidu, sharad pavaar, tejasvi yadav, arvind kejariwal, akhilesh yadav yahaan tak ki tatasth rahane vaale bijedy supremeo or odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ne bhi aapasi matbhed bhulaakar isaki ninda kii thi
 Let me tell you that most of these parties are those who have been opposed to the Congress before
 khud mamata banerjee or sharad pavaar ne congress alag hokar apana raajnneetik vajood banaaya
 But today all these parties are uniting and fighting against the Modi government of the Center in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 yaad kiijie gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan kshetreey dalon ko apane peeche yah kah kar ikattha kiya tha 'dilli sultanate' unhen hameshaa asammanit karti rahi he
 Now Mamata Banerjee is using the same strategy of PM Modi and uniting the opposition, accusing her of harassing the ruling anti-bjp state governments at the center
 baharhaal sibiai ke is ection ne ek taraf jahaan vipaksh ko ekajute kar diya he
 So the Telangana Chief Minister, who is practicing the Federal Front

 The pre-monsoon has knocked in the capital of the country but if we look at the preparations for the monsoon in the capital, once again the problems of the people remain the same
 barish hote hi logon ke gharon ke aas-paas kooday ke dher or khule naale rahanaa dubhar kar dete hai
 The monsoon has not yet fully arrived and the problems of people's filth, smell and diseases have started
 chiraag dilli ke khule naale main badboo kaa alam ye he ki uske aasapaas se guzarana mushkil he
 There are residential population of 11 to 12 thousand around the nullah, who every year rain the stench of this drain and the diseases caused by aquatic mosquitoes
 sarkarein badalati gayi lekin is khule naale kaa koi kuch nahin kar paaya
 During the heavy rains, the water and garbage from this drain reaches the roads
 'aaj tak' kii team ne ilaake kii nai nigam parshad puja jangada ko bhi is naale ke paas bulaayaa or is gambhir samasya ke bare main poocha to unhone nigam main is naale ke mudde ko uthaane kii baat kahi
 But Councilor Madam did not see any concrete answer and planning regarding this serious problem
 rajdhani ke kuch ilaakon kii in tasveeron se saaf he ki is baar bhi barsaat se pehlenigam or sarkaaraki taraf se kooday yaa naalon kii safai ke liye koi pukhta taiyaariyaan najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Now in such a situation, the capitalists got some relief from the sun and heat, but the problems of rain are standing in front of them

 He said that when 100 percent people will join the bank, then the benefits of government schemes will reach the people directly

 He said that when we came to know about the delay in the creation of passports, it was found that there was a shortage of five lakh passport booklets in the country and we removed six million booklets in one month, removing all the difficulties in this matter
 Got it printed
 isi tarah purv main passport banane ke liye 28 kaary diwas kaa samay lagata tha, jise ghataakar saat kaary diwas kar diya gaya he or ab ise bhi ghataakar teen din karne kaa lakshya he
 Foreign e-passport will start soon Foreign Minister said that the ministry is considering starting the service of e-passport soon

 In response to the question of the disappearance of 39 Indians in Iraq, Sushma Swaraj said that there is no lack of any kind in the effort to find the missing Indians, but we have brought seven and a half thousand people out of there safely
 iske alaava saadhe teen hajaar libya se or ek hajaar bharatiyon ko ukraine se bhi laayaa gaya he
 Question of black money in foreign banks Sushma Swaraj said that the government has done little work to bring black money and the Prime Minister had effectively raised it in the G20 conference
 -input bhashaa se Has the Uttar Pradesh government become insensitive? Has Mulayam Singh Yadav's socialism turned into Maujism? These questions are arising because while people are forced to die in the cold in Muzaffarnagar riot-affected relief camps in the state, in the name of promoting folk art culture in Saifai, Bollywood's money was poured out like water
 
 kehete hai jab rome jal rahaa tha vahaan kaa shaasha nero banshi baja rahaa tha
 a similar view was seen in Uttar Pradesh as well
 saifai mahotsav main ek ore jashn manaaya ja rahaa he vahiin duusari taraf mujffarnagar ke danga peediton ko raahat shivi main bhi koi raahat nahin mil rahi he
 The picture of the state changed from Muzaffarnagar to Saifai
 
 
 ek hi pradesh main duniya kaise badal jaati he ye mujffarnagar se saifai kaa faasla bataata he
 If you complete this journey for five hours, then the journey from hell to heaven is complete
 mujffanagar main danga peediton ke raahat shivi kii badintjami ke saath saifai mahotsav kii tasveeron ko dekhen to man main yahi sawaal uthegaa ki aakhir upi sarkaar ko kya ho gaya he?kahin chakachaundh to kahin bebasii ke aansu
 
 
 All the big and big stars of Bollywood came to dance to their tune in Mulayam and Akhilesh's organ
 vahiin saifai se kuch dur mujffarnagar apni bebasii par aansu baha rahaa tha
 Today, even Muzaffarnagar must have thought that my luck would have been like Saifai
 ek taraf ye dua ki kaash ye raat tham jaae, duusari taraf badintjami ke bich raahat campon main kadaake kii thand se jujhate danga peediton kii dua ki kaash raat jald cat jaae
 If people die in Muzaffarnagar camp, then it doesn't matter if they die
 saifai main jashn feekaa nahin hona chahie
 This is understandable considering the glare of the previous night in Saifai
 You get the feeling @imvkohli is going to be the difference between the 2 teams over the new few weeks

 agar vah aisa nahin karengi to sampradayik takaton aakar janata ko bhramit karke uske bhavishya ke saath khilwaad karengi
 Priyanka said that it is the right of the people of the state to get progress, but the leaders of other parties in the state understand that they are doing their favor by developing

 In fact, this exception to the IPC375 (2) law states that if someone forms a relationship with a wife of 15 to 18 years of age, she will not be considered a rapist
 kendra sarkaar ne court me kanoon kii tarafdaari karte hue kaha ki sansad ne saamaajik paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue is kanoon ko nahin chhedaa
 There are still cases of child marriage in the economically backward society in the country

 The Supreme Court said this when it was argued by the Central Government that this tradition has been going on for centuries
 isliye sansad ise sangrakshan de rahaa he
 That is, if someone makes a relationship with a wife of 15 to 18 years, then she will not be considered a rapist
 centre sarkaar ne ye bhi kaha agar court ko lagata he ki ye sahi nahin he, to sansad is par vichaar karegi
 Earlier, while hearing in the case of child marriage, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that child marriage is considered a crime in the law
 uske baavjood log bal vivaah karte hai
 The court remarked that it is not a marriage, but a mirage
 supreme court ne kaha ki hamaare paas teen vikalp hai- pehla is apwaad ko hataa den, jiskaa matlab he ki bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaata or use rape mana jaae
 Know, what happens in mother's milk, which protects children from infection
 
 
 court ne kaha ki doosraa vikalp ye he ki is maamle main posco act lagu kiya jaae
 That is, in case of child marriage, if her husband forms a relationship with a girl of 15 to 18 years, then she should have it done under Posco
 or teesraa vikalp ye he ki isamen kuch na kiya jaae or ise apwaad mana jaae, jiskaa matlab ye he ki bal vivaah ke maamle main 15 se 18 saal kii ladki ke saath agar uskaa pati sambandh banaata to wo rape nahin mana jaayegaa
 On the other hand, the petitioner had argued on Tuesday that child marriage is violating the rights of children
 bal vivaah bacchon par ek tarah kaa jurm he, kyonki kam umr main shaadi karne se unka yon utpeedan zyada hota he
 In such a situation, children need to be protected
 is par centre ne apane affidavit main kaha he ki saal 2006 se bal vivaah ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kiye jane ke baavjood desh ke kai hisson main ab bhi bal vivaah kaa prachlan he
 In such a situation, it is essential to ensure the safety of married men and women
 bataa den ki desh main vivaah kii umr mahilaon ke liye 18 or purushon ke liye 21 saal rakhi gai he
 Marriage done at an early age is considered a crime

 jab bhi chunaav najadik aane lagate hai, rajnatikon kaa daliton ke ghar aana-janaa bad jaataa he
 Some people and parties start doing food politics
 daliton ke ghar bhojan karke unhen apana banane kii koshish koi nai nahin he
 This work was started by Rahul Gandhi among the recent leaders
 yah baat or he ki iskaa koi khaas asar padaa nahin tha
 Rahul Gandhi stops and dines at Dalits' homes every now and then
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah bhi karte rahe hai
 Shah had eaten at the house of a Dalit in Banaras, but his stance was turned upside down
 amit shah ne dalit ke ghar bhojan kiya or uske baad desh bhar main dalit utpeedan kii itani adhik ghatnaayen huin ki sarkaar sakate main aa gai
 He had to come on defensive
 haalanki, daliton ko apni party se jodne ke liye bhartiya janata party ne apane netaaon se daliton ke gharon main jaakar bhojan karne kaa nirdesh diya tha, lekin party kaa koi nirdesh sambhavatya jabaan sambhalakar bolne ke babat nahin tha
 So whenever the words of the leaders who came to the house of the Dalits took food, the party was seen to be angry
 yogi sarkaar main mantri anupama jaiswal ne kaha, ''sarkaar ke mantri raatbhar daliton ke ghar jate hai or unhen machhar kaat rahe hai
 Dalits stay home despite mosquito bites
 ''isse pehle yogi sarkaar main mantri rajendra pratap ne khud kii tulana bhagwaan ram ke saath kii thi
 Rajendra Pratap said, "ram also ate Shabri's yoke plum
 ''upi sarkaar ke hi ganna vikaas mantri suresh rana ne dalit parivaar ke yahaan halwaiyon ke haath ke banaae paalak paneer, makhni daal, chhola, raita, tandoor, coffee, rasagulla or mineral water lutf uthaaya tha
 But is this move by political parties really important or is it an ego-like move to save the Dalits? Is eating at the houses of Dalits guaranteed to ensure vote bank? This question is because Dalits are being used even in the changing social times
 vikaas yojanaon kaa laabh unhen mili yaa naa mili, dalit vot bank jarur ban jaataa he
 Such steps are taken only to convert Dalits into a cadre vote bank
 uttar pradesh main dalit voter takreeban 20
 5 percent
 asal main, daliton ke paas netritv ke maamle main vikalpon kii kami rahi he shaayad isliye unka istemaal karnaa thodaa zyada aasaan he or dalit ke ghar bhojan kaa ‘drama hit’ ho jaataa he
 However, the problem of eating together is more serious in India
 yah bahes maansaahaari-shaakaahaari se judaa hone ke saath-saath kya shaakaahaar or kya maansaahaar is par bhi nirbhar karata he
 If you go to Indian villages, then you have to understand the definition of raw and cooked food and also to know when raw food can be eaten and when to eat cooked food? It is not just caste related issue
 ek hi jati main bhi rishte tay hone se pehle bhi kaccha khaanaa saath nahin khaaya jaataa
 If you want to eat together, then it will be important to adopt the advice of Uma Bharti that Dalits should call their house (why only leaders?) And sit and eat together
 baharhaal, sawaal yah he ki post-ambedkar, post-mandal siyaasi daur main, daliton ke yahaan unheen ke yahaan pakaaya or unheen ke baratanon main saath khaanaa kitna mahatvapurn he? jabaki daliton se jude duusare mudde kahin zyada ahm hai
 Especially in the last two years when the question of Dalit oppression, social mobilization, employment, education, health, dignity and fair representation is more important, symbolic things like eating should be kept secondary

 Actor Irrfan Khan, who has garnered accolades from films like 'talwar', 'jazbaa' and 'piku', is in his home town Jaipur to promote the upcoming film 'madari'
 'madari' ke pramotional event main id-ul-juha ko lekar irfan khan ne vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Irfan said, 'qurbani means to sacrifice something unique
 ye nahin ki bazaar se aap koi do bakre kharid laae or unako qurbaan kar diya
 You have nothing to do with those goats, so where did that sacrifice go? What blessings does this mean? Every man should ask from his heart that how will he get merit by killing someone else
 'irfaanne yah bhi kaha ki hamaare jo bhi tyohaar hai, unka matlab hamen waapas se samajhnaa chahie ki wo kisalie banaae gaye hai
 i am fortunate to live in a country where every religion is respected
 'irfan ne mantriyon par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'jis tarah madari damru bajaakar vaada karata tha ki saanp or nevale kii ladaai dikhayega, lekin kabhi dikhaata nahin, aise hi vaade mantri karte hai, par puraa nahin kar pate

 nishikant kaamat nirdeshit film 'madari' 15 july ko relies hogi

 Irfan said why Muslims are silent against terrorism
 netaaon ko bhi madari bataate hue kaha ki janata ko netaaon se sawaal poochna chahie na ki chup rahanaa chahie
 Irrfan Khan's interference in religious matters did not go down with Mushlim religious leaders and they all opposed Irfan with one voice
 jamaayat ulema e hind ne kaha he ki irfan actor hai or acting karen dharm ke maamle main na bolen jamaayat ulema e hind ke state jenrel secretary moulana abdul vaahid khatri irfan ye sab apni publicity ke liye kar rahe hai

 But during the last one year, no private player has stepped forward to buy a stake in IDBI Bank
 ise padhein
 
 
 LIC in crisis, do not get drowned by this move of Modi government
 Your insurance money IDBI Bank needs a huge amount in the next few years so that it can improve its accountability by plugging its dirty debts
 yah rakam use kisi nijee khilaadi ko hissedari bechney par nahin mil rahi
 In such a situation, an investment of 11 to 13 thousand crores from LIC will be very important to improve the bank's position
 is saude se ek baat puri tarah saaf ho rahi he ki centre sarkaar ne ek sarkari bank ko doobane se bachaane ke liye yah formula nikaala he
 Under this formula, he has to save the government bank from his treasury without spending any money
 haalanki is nivesh se LIC ke paise par khatra mandaraane lagegaa
 Because of this danger, the money of the common man lying in the Life Insurance Corporation will come under threat
 aarthik jaankaron ko is baat kaa dar he ki LIC kaa IDBI bank main nivesh se LIC par khatre ke saath-saath beemaa dharakon ko paise lautaane kii uski kshamta par bhi khatra mandaraane lagegaa
 This situation can become more dangerous with another fact because LIC has been facing problems in paying bonus on its policy during the last few years
 LIC dwaara IDBI bank main yah nivesh karne ke virodh main bank karmchaariyon ke sanghathan ne haal hi main kaaryakari vitt mantri piyush goyal ko patr likhakar kaha tha ki jis tarah se desh ke kai bank enpie kii samasya se jujh rahe hai thik usee tarah LIC bhi bade enpie or gande nivesh kii samasya se jujh rahaa he
 18 out of 21 banks put money, is LIC buying IDBI under government pressure? In such a situation, if LIC is charged with the responsibility of saving IDBI bank from drowning, then it is possible that under this pressure, it is difficult Get surrounded
 LIC par mushkilen badhane se jaahir he ki desh main lagbhag 38 karod jivan beemaa policy dharakon ke sabase ahm nivesh par bhi khatra mandaraane lagegaa
 Significantly, the responsibility of saving a government bank is only on the shoulders of the central government
 yadi koi sarkari bank apane karmchaariyon ke galat faislon ke chalate enpie kii samasya main chalaa gaya he to centre sarkaar ko chahie ki vah aise adhikariyon ke khilaaf kadaa kadam uthaae
 At the same time, the bad loan of a bank has been collected because the economic situation of the country has changed due to which the bank has made a bad loan for the infrastructure sector, then the central government should arrange for the capital from its treasury
 donon hi sthiti main kisi anya sarkari sanstha main pade aam aadmi ke paise par khatra daalate hue bank karmchaariyon kii galati athwa desh kii aarthik sthiti par pardaa daalane kaa kadam uthaanaa sawaalon ke ghere main he
 If this exercise to save IDBI is the government's formula to save 18 sick banks in 21, then after this, is the central government preparing to play bets on 17 government companies to save 17 other banks that are burdened with npas? In all, 257 public sector undertakings (psu-government companies) are operating
 inamen indian oil, oengisi or kol india centre sarkaar ke liye sabase zyada munafa batorne vaali companiyaan hai
 Apart from this, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals are also big profit making companies for the Central Government
 vahiin centre sarkaar kii hindustan fertilizer corporation or power finance corporation bhi uski vaarshik kamai kaa bada hissaa laati hai
 All these companies are among the top 10 companies of the central government
 centre sarkaar ke apane aankadon ke mutabik uski 257 sarkari companiyon ne jahaan 2015-16 ke dauraan kul 1 lakh 14 hajaar 239 karod rupee kaa munafa batora vahiin 2016-17 ke dauraan inhen 1 lakh 27 hajaar 602 karod rupee kaa munafa hua
 11 of these companies during 2017-18
 7 fisadi munafa badha
 At the same time, all the big banks, except three banks in the list of public sector banks, are facing the problem of NPA
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya centre sarkaar ne desh main sarkari bainkon kii sthiti sudhaarney ke liye sarkari company kaa sahaara lene kaa formula taiyaar kiya he or lic-idbidila usee formule ko parakhane kaa pehla namoona he
 After LIC, will the central government turn to other state-run companies making profits? At the same time, the question also arises that if the Central Government needed to examine this policy, why did it choose only LIC, leaving all its Navratna companies? Is public money lying in LIC the biggest reason for its decision? danga peediton ke liye shaayad hi kabhi aisi skim kisi sarkaar ne banaayi ho, jaisi uttar pradesh kii akhilesh sarkaar ne banaayi he
 According to the scheme that the UP government has run for the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar, the riot victims are being asked to take five lakh rupees and leave the relief camp
 shaayad is skim par kisi ko yakeen na ho, lekin yahi sach he
 The Muzaffarnagar administration has adopted every tact, but the riot victims living in the relief camp were not ready to leave the camp
 isliye rupayon ke dam par ab uttar pradesh sarkaar ne mujffarnagar prashasan ko aadesh diya he ki raahat shivi main rahane vaale pariwaro ko 5-5 lakh rupee do or raahat shivi se jane ke liye kaho
 The first condition under this scheme is that the family will not return to their original village after taking compensation of five lakh rupees

 This assessment has been proved correct

 All Bollywood actresses from Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to Katrina Kaif are trying to change their glamorous image by taking off-the-door roles, but this does not apply in the case of model-turned-actress Udita Goswami
 udita kaa kahana he ki unhen apni apni bindaas chhavi se koi shikaayat nahin he or vah ise katai badalanaa nahin chaahati
 The 26-year-old Udita, who started her career with films like Paap, Zahra and Baar, often has a sexy and cool actress even after five years, but Udita has no objection to it
 udita ne kaha ki main apni chhavi badalane ke bare main kabhi nahin sochati, kyonki aisa karnaa koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 i think my face is not like Indian girls
 main aishwarya, deepika yaa rani kii tarah bhartiya nahin dikhti
 Although most of Udita's films are placed in adult category, Udita said that she would like to work in romantic comedy films
 unhone kaha ki main romantic kamedi karnaa chaahati hum, lekin is tarah kii filmon ke ofer abhi nahin he or mere paas yah bhoomikaayen karne ke alaava or koi chaara nahin he
 Udita has worked in the recently released Jag Mundra film Chase, but she too has been placed in the adult film category
 unhone kaha ki main aisi bhoomikaaon main hi thik hum, kyanki log mujhe isi tarah kii bhoomikaaon main pasand karte he
 That is why i worked in films like 'roque' and 'chase'
 main kuch parvithan laane kii koshish kar rahi hum
 But after a limit you cannot make too much change
 agar iske kuch nuksaan he, to phaayde bhi he

 After the embarrassing defeat in the UP elections, another name in the Congress along with Rahul Gandhi came under target
 wo tha congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor yani pike kaa
 On the day of the results, UP Congress general secretary Umesh Pandit told Aaj Tak that his strategist PK along with Rahul is responsible for the defeat
 jinhone sattavirohi lahar jhel rahi sapa ke saath gathjod karaayaa
 Since PK was Rahul's choice, no Congressman is speaking openly, but all the big leaders of the state as well as senior leaders of the state are unhappy with the open exemption given by PK in UP
 darasal in sabhi netaaon kaa tark he ki pike prachaar-prasar main apni bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai lekin gathbandhan karnaa yaa nahin karnaa ekasiyaasi faisla hota he, jisamen pike kaa dakhal nahin hona chahie
 He also gives an example that in Punjab, PK only took the responsibility of publicity, but the final seal on all of it was that of Captain Amarinder Singh
 pike, captain or pradesh par haaavee nahin the vahiin upi main iskaa ulta tha
 PK was the architect of every decision from the alliance
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki had to tab ho gai jab pike hi gathbandhan main siton par fanse pench ko sulajhane ke liye akhilesh se baat karne gaye
 In such a situation, after the UP elections, PK was also taking time to think whether to work with the Congress high command in these circumstances
 vahiin duusari taraf rahul bhi apane netaaon kii pike ko lekar nakhushi jaan chuke the lekin sutron kii maane to donon taraf se aage bhi saath kaam karne kaa man banaaya ja rahaa he
 According to sources, now Rahul is planning to use PK in another important political province
 vaise iske peeche vajah bhi he
 In fact, PK started his career as a political strategist with Narendra Modi from Gujarat itself and achieved success
 unke paas gujarat kaa khaasaa anubhav bhi he isiilie rahul us amubhav kaa phayda aagaamigujrat chunaavamein lenaa chaahate hai
 PK also wants to avenge the UP defeat by defeating the BJP in Gujarat
 rahul or pike kii hone vaali agali mulaakaat main is par antim faisla hone kii ummid he
 It is to be decided how to reconcile between the role of PK and the role of Congress leaders in the state, so that it is not like UP but a Punjab victory
 haalanki is bare main naa hi pike or naa hi congress kaa koi netaa khulkar bolne ko taiyaar he

 During his stay in Rajgir, the CBI raided the residence of RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav in Patna, but he has not yet given any response to it
