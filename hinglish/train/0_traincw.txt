 pichley dinon uttar pradesh main bhimrao ambedkar kii pratimaaon ko kshatigrast kiye jane ke kai maamle saamne aae
 Meanwhile, in order to prevent any such possible incident in Mathura district, the Senior Superintendent of Police has instructed all the police in-charge to take full vigil in their respective areas and has also warned of rasuka against those who do so
 mathura ke varisht police adheekshak prabhakar choudhary ne is sambandh main jari aadesh main shararti tatwon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai karne ke liye kaha he
 Chaudhary has issued a warning against the use of the National Security Act against those who harm the statues of Ambedkar and other great men
 unhone daliton sahit sabhi virgon ke logon ko aashwast kiya he ki janapad main is prakaar kii koi bhi ghatana nahin hone di jaaegi or agar kisi ne aisa karne kii cheshtaa bhi kii to uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Unhappy over the damage to the idols of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, BJP mps also annoyed by such incidents, Savitri Bai Phule, MP from Bahraich of the Bharatiya Janata Party, demanded that a case of national treason be filed against those who had damaged the idols of Baba Saheb
 pratimaa todane ke kai maamlagauratlab he ki elahabaad main jhusee ke trivenipuram main dow

 After being named in the money laundering case, NCP chief Sharad Pawar (79) has defeated the BJP, showing heights
 pavaar jo ki jo raajnneeti ke puraane khilaadi hai jinhone anubhav or samparkon ke dam par khud ko majboot kiya he
 In his home state Maharashtra where elections are going to be held, Pawar got the notice of ED, ie ED four days ago
 pavaar ko jo rajya main bijepi ke pramukh virdohi netaaon main se ek hai
 NCP workers took to the streets of Mumbai against Pawar's notice
 ( twitor nahin jise aajkal vipaksh pradarshan karne ke liye chunata he) isse ghabaraae idi ke adhikariyon ne sharad pavaar ko ek email bheja or kaha ki use unase milane kii koi jaldbaaji nahin he
 But this had no effect on Pawar and said that he wanted to cooperate with the agency and would reach the ed's office after noon on Friday
 iske baad mumbai police kamishnar ke lau and order ke naam par kii gai saarvajanik apil ko dekhte hue pavaar ne shaleentapurvak idi offis jane kaa kaarykram cancil kar diya
 However, in the meantime, Shiv Sena of BJP has come in support of Sharad Pawar and termed ed's notice as 'politics of revenge'
 sena ne kaha 'idi ke notice ne ek vipaksh ko maharashtra chunaav se pehle ek baar phir se sanjivani de di he'or kal shaam tak jo score tha vah kuch aise tha, pavaar-1 or bijepi-0
 Till now, Pawar whom PM Modi once said even to 'political guru', BJP used to reverse those to emerge
 sharad pavaar ke bhattije or ensipi main duusare number kii haisiyat rakhane vaale ajit pavaar kaa naam bhi idi ke cese main he
 Ajit Pawar has resigned from the post of MLA and since then he is unable to be contacted
 paanch baar vidhayak rahe ajit pavaar ne apane chachaa sharad pavaar se bhi baat karne se inkaar kar diya he
 It seems that the quarrel in the Pawar family is now openly due to the BJP
 sharad pavaar ne ek bahut hi damege control karne kii koshish kii or kaha ki unke bhattije or maharashtra ke purv up mukhyamantri ne apane chachaa ke khilaaf badale kii raajnneeti ko dil se le liya he isliye unhone raajnneeti ko chhodkar ab puraane bijness or kheti kii ore lautne kaa faisla kiya he
 But while Sharad Pawar was trying to show unity, Ajit Pawar's son Parth Pawar, on the other hand, kept denying that his father was not giving up politics
 parth ne puure maamle main ek mode dete hue kaha ki unke pita unako raajnneeti main aane se pehle agaah kiya tha ki yah ek 'ganda dhandha' he
 'pawar vs Pawar' fights are being pushed by a senior BJP leader who is currently in touch with Ajit Pawar
 darasal vaastaviktaa yah he ki pavaar ke bhattije ne party main jari uttaradhikaar kii ladaai ko dil se le liya he
 Sources say that there has been no conversation between uncle and nephew in the last 6 months
 ajit pavaar isliye bhi naaraaz hai ki ensipi kii ore se sharad pavaar ko nishkalank netaa ke taur par dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi he or unako naam galat tareeke se idi ke cese main daalaa gaya he jabaki unke liye aisa koi abhiyaan nahin chalaaya ja rahaa he
 On the one hand, while Sharad Pawar was surrounded by the leaders of the core group of NCP on Thursday and himself was monitoring the performance of the workers, on the other hand Ajit Pawar's absence was drawing attention
 iske saath hi sharad pavaar ne congress sahit vipaksh ke kai netaaon se baat kii
 Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also tweeted in support of him
 pavaar ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se bhi baat kii
 But in this entire exercise, Ajit Pawar's name was not even taken by the leaders of the opposition
 sharad pavaar ne saarvajanik rup se kaha ki yah unka aakhri chunaav hoga
 Earlier Ajit Pawar was the successor of Sharad Pawar
 lekin ajit pavaar ke kai betuke bayanon ne unke chachaa ko naaraaz kar diya
 During this period, Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule continued to increase her stature in politics
 saarvajanik taur parivaar main ekta kii dikhaane kii koshish hoti rahi lekin andar hi andar matbhed gahare ho rahe the
 The entry into politics of Sharad Pawar's grandson Rohit Pawar once again upset Ajit Pawar
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main bhi rohit pavaar kii ore se amit shah par kiye gaye hamale kii tarif kii gai
 As elections in Maharashtra are close, politics has taken the form of a family profession in the beginning
 ek ore jahaan shivasena ne bijepi ke saath is shart par gathbandhan kiya he ki uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare ko up mukhyamantri (sabase pehle maine is report ko enditivi ko diya tha) banaaya jayega
 However, the BJP was always vigilant about it as before
 sharad pavaar kii jaisi hi vaapasi ke sanket mili, ajit pavaar kaa istipha kaa tay ho gaya tha
 Everything is now dependent on Sharad Pawar, who is fighting the biggest battle of life
 vah hameshaa dinge haankate the ki unhone khud koi chunaav nahin haara he or yah paariwarik ladaai bahut hi vyaktigat he

 varsh 2014 ke aakhri maheene main jab mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya ko 'bharat ratna' se sammanit kiye jane kii ghoshnaa hui to banaras main khushi kii lahar daud gai, or isaki ek badi vajah yah thi ki banaras desh main pehla aisa jila ban gaya, jahaan ke rahane vaale yaa usase judi saat hastiyaan desh ke sarvocch naagarik sammaan 'bharat ratna' se vibhooshit kii ja chuki hai, yani duusare shabdon main kaha ja saktaa he ki banaras 'bharat ratnon kaa shahar' ban gaya he
 If we take a look at who are these personalities of Banaras who get this honor, then not only do we get to know the life of ganges-jamuni Tehzeeb of Banaras, but also the Triveni of knowledge-science and music in Banaras called the city of Ghats
 The feeling of being is also cemented
 
 
 banaras kii vibhootiyon ko 'bharat ratna' milane kii shuruyaat is sammaan kii sthapana ke saath hi ho gai thi
 The first three eminent personalities who were conferred with this honor in the year 1954 included Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Vice Chancellor of the Banaras Hindu University from 1939 to 1948, and since then this trend has continued
 xxrep 91 - xxrep 50 - xxrep 41 - varsh 1955 main yah sammaan banaras main 12 janvari, 1869 ko saah parivaar main janme bhagwaan das ko diya gaya, jo bade chintak, vichaarak, shikshavid or darshanik the
 Dozens of books written by Bhagwan Das testify to his knowledge
 bahut kam log jaanate honge ki bhagwaan das ne ek taraf madan mohan malviya ke saath milakar banaras hindu uniwarsity kii neenv rakhi thi, vahiin duusari taraf unhone kaashi viapeeth kii sthapana bhi kii
 He also played a role in the Theosophical Society debut with Annie Besant
 unke parpote samirkant kaa kahana he, "dada ji ek mahaan darshanik the, unhone kai kitaaben likhin, bahut bade shikshavid the, unhone central hindu skool kii sthapana kii, vah kaashi viapeeth ke founder chancelar the, biechayu librari main unka ek alag section bhi he
 
 
 " iske baad varsh 1966 main desh ko 'jai jawan jai kisaan' kaa naaraa dene vaale banaras ke bahadur shastri ko 'bharat ratna' se sammanit kiya gaya
 Lal Bahadur Shatri's house is in Ramnagar, Benares
 kehete hai ki vah bade achche tairaak the or padhai ke dauraan aksar ganga tairkar is paar aate the
 The whole country is convinced of the simplicity and honesty of Lal Bahadur Shatri, who was the second Prime Minister of the country
 varsh 1966 ke baad ek kaaphi lanbaa antaraal guzar gaya, or pratiksha par viraam tab laga, jab banaras main janme or apane sitar se puri duniya ko zankrut kar dene vaale pandit ravishankar ko varsh 1999 main yah sammaan hasil hua
 Although Pandit Ravi Shankar had taken citizenship of America, but he remained with Banaras
 iske lagbhag turant baad varsh 2001 main ustad bismillah khan ko 'bharat ratna' se nawaaza gaya, lekin vah sammaan unase kahin zyaada unki 'jaadui phoonk' ke liye tha
 
 
 In fact, the musical shehnai had been ringing on the doors of people's homes on auspicious occasions for decades, but Ustad Bismillah Khan blew it so that he got up from the antechamber and started playing in the courtyard, so that honor of Ustad Bismillah Khan was that ' The 'magical blow' was found
 varsh 2001 ke baad agle 'bharat ratna' ke liye banaras ko 12 varsh intazaar karnaa padaa, or varsh 2013 main prasiddh rasayanavid sienaar raav ko sammanit kiye jate hi pratiksha kii ghadiyaan samaapt huin
 By the way, CNR Rao was not born in Banaras, but Banaras Hindu University was his workplace
 
 
 
 And then the very next year, that is, in 2014, the person from Banaras who was awarded 'bharat Ratna' is much bigger than being called a title or 'ratna', because he himself was 'mahamana'
 khayr, der se hi sahi, lekin mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya ko 'bharat ratna' die jane se sabhi prasann hai, haalanki hamaara maananaa he ki yah sammaan shuru hote hi 'mahaamanaa' ko mil janaa chahie tha
 However, with the awarding of 'bharat Ratna' to Mahamana, Benaras became the first city in the country to have seven different names 'bharat Ratna'
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki kaashi kii vividhtaon kaa failaav hi aisa he ki 'bharat ratna' is shahar main aae bina nahin rah saktaa
 Girish Chandra Tripathi, Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University, says, "whether it is in the field of education or science, whether it is music or politics, all the dimensions that ensure the identity of society were in Kashi since ancient times, even in the middle
 Remained, and even today, their number is sufficient in Kashi, who are able to preserve its culture

 Many previous rivers were based on questions arising on the life of the rivers
 adiganga, ramganga, khud ganga, gomti
 
 
 The pollution in all these rivers and our tendency to draw all the water from the rivers has raised serious questions on the existence of rivers in the country
 phir ek sawaal koun banegaa karodpati main dikhaa ki dakshin kii ganga kis nadi ko kehete hai? jaahir he iskaa uttar hamamen se kai logon ko maaloom hoga
 But many more questions arise about this question that if the Godavari is the Ganges of the south, then should the Ganges of the East or the West be either? Or how many rivers, whose names are similar to the Ganges? i have written about it by experts and experts writing some authentic writings
 tab mujhe laga ki nadisutra main ham pradooshan kii baat to karenge hi, par kuch aisi dilachasp baaten bhi aapako bataanaa chahie ki nadiyon kii samskruti, uske kinare pali-badi sabhyataa or hamaari viraasat or itihaas kii halki-si jhalak aapako mil sake
 Now from these materials i came to know that many rivers of the country are like this, or at least their names are such that they have presence in multiple states
 masalan, parinita dandekar likhti hai ki ham sabhi dhauliganga naam kii ek hi nadi kaa astitv jaanate hai
 But the truth is that there are two Dhauliganga in Uttarakhand itself
 pehali, jo mahakali basin main bahati he or duusari jo upree ganga basin main
 Dandekar writes that why only Dhauliganga, duplicate rivers of Kali, Kosi and Ramgangi exist
 agar ham nadiyon ke namakaran ke itihaas main jaaen to aapako lupt or vismrit sabhyataaon, is ilaake ke itihaas or bhugol ke bare main bhi nai or alahada jaankariyaan milengi
 But researching these rivers is not that easy
 is post main shaayad main ekaadh nadiyon ke naamon ke bare main kuch jaankariyaan saajha kar paaun
 In the sixth grade history book itself, we are taught that the great civilizations of the world have developed in the river valleys
 apane hindustan, yaa bharat yaa india kaa namakaran bhi to nadi ke naam par hi hua he
 Take indus, it is derived from the old Iranian word Hindu
 kyonki arya log vahaan bahane vaali nadi ko sindhu (yani sagar) kehete the
 The word is from Sanskrit and the people of Shakdweep (iran), who could not pronounce s, started calling those living on the other side of this river as Hindu
 rugveda ke nadistuti sookt main sindhu nadi kaa ling nirdhaaran to nahin he, lekin baaki kii nadiyaan streeling hi hai
 Dandekar writes, there is Indus, Abasin or Pitru river in Pashto language which is also called Senga Chhu or Lion River in Ladakhi language
 gajab yah ki tibet main bhi is nadi ko senge jangbo hi kehete hai iskaa matlab bhi sher nadi hi hota he or donon hi shabd puling hai
 There is also a strange miracle of determining the sex of rivers
 bharat kii adhikansh nadiyaan (adivasee naamon vaali nadiyaan bhi) adhiktar streeling hi hai
 Also, in Indian culture some rivers have also been considered as pulling
 isaki badi misaal to brahmaputra hi he
 Dandekar, quoting Dhiman Dasgupta, writes that Yarlang Zangbo, the original stream of the Brahmaputra, is also Pulling
 isi tarah isaki pramukh sahaayak nadi lohit bhi he
 Most of the rivers flowing in West Bengal, except Mayurakshi, are of male name
 masalan, damodar, rupanarayan, baraakar, barakeshwar, ajay, pagalaa, jaipandas, gadadhari, bhairav or navpaatr
 The question is why the names of these rivers were named after most men? Dandekar quotes Dasgupta as saying that the nature of these rivers has been generally subversive
 isliye unako puling naam die gaye honge
 Let's take the example of Sutlej, a little to the north
 iskaa vaidic naam shatadru he
 Cent means hundred, dr means road
 yani saikadon raaston se bahane vaali nadi
 In a seminar, the litterateur Kaka Saheb Kalelkar once called these rivers Mukta Veni or Yukta Veni (reference to the top of the hair)
 baalo kii charchaa chali he to maharashtra ke pashchimi ghat main bahane vaali nadi hiranyakeshi kaa naam yaad aata he
 Hiranya means gold
 samajhie ki suraj kii kirnon main is nadi kaa pani kisi sunahari abha se damakata hoga
 In tribal traditions too, the name of rivers is usually called Pulling
 sikkim main shaadiyon main rangit (purush) nadi or ragenu (stri, prachlit naam tista) nadiyon ke prem ke geet gaae jate hai
 The story is that these two beloved rivers descended from the mountains to seek the blessings of Mount Khanchengadzonga
 rangit ko rasta dikhaane ke liye ek chidiya aage-aage ud rahi thi or jabaki ranganew ko rasta dikhaa rahaa tha ek saanp
 Ranganu caught the snake's cross-slippery path and reached the plains first and started looking for Rangit (teesta)
 bhutiya chidiya ne rangit ko rasta bhatka diya jo upar-neeche raste main bhatak gaya
 He was late in coming
 sikkimi lokkatha ke mutabik, purush hone ke naate rangit ne ranganew ko pehle pahunchakar intjaar karte dekha to use bahut bura laga
 After this, Ranganyu celebrated Rangit very much - saying that the late arrival was not his fault
 tab jaakar rangit mana
 There is also a similar story of Chandra and Bhaga, who together form the Chandrabhaga River
 yahi chandrabhaga ek taraf chenab bhi kahi jaati he
 But this story is about the Lahaul Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh
 lokkatha ke mutabik, chand kii beti chandra, jiskaa udgam chandra taal se he, bhaaga naamak nad se prem karti thi
 Bhaga was the son of Lord Surya
 vah suraj taal se nikalataa he
 Both of them decided that they would go to Baralachala Pass and come back from opposite directions and then get married in Tandi
 chandra bal khaati hui tandi tak pahunch gai jab bhaaga kaa rasta utana aasaan nahin tha
 Chandra is worried about not finding Bhaga and she goes back to Keylong to find him
 chandra ne dekha, bhaaga ek gahari khai ke bich se apni raah banane kii koshishon main juta tha
 Eventually they met at Tandi and beyond that the river was named Chandrabhaga
 dilachasp yah he ki pashchim bengal main bhi veerbhum jile main ek chandrabhaga bahati he
 Dandekar writes that another Chandrabhaga is near Ahmedabad in Gujarat
 puri ke paas konark mandir ke paas se bahane vaali nadi kaa naam bhi chandrabhaga he
 Chandrabhaga is a river flowing in Pandharpur near the Vitthal temple
 vaise ek chandrabhaga bihar main bhi he, jise chanan nadi kaha jaataa he
 The stories of the names of the rivers are very interesting and we will try to hear some more interesting stories in Nadi Sutra next time
 (manjit thakur, india today main vishesh samvaadadaata hai)*** PV Sindhu of India had to face defeat in the Rio Olympics women's singles badminton match
 lekin is haar ke baad bhi sindhu ne rio olympic main silver medal jitkar itihaas rach diya
 Sindhu became India's first female badminton player to win a silver medal at the Olympics
 isse pehle bharat kaa koi bhi badminton khilaadi is mukaam tak nahin pahunch sakaa he
 In the final, Sindhu lost to World No
 1 Badminton player Carolina Marin in a struggling match
 jeet ke baad sindhu boleen ki main yahaan medal jeetne ai thi or maine apana sarvshereshth diya
 Sindhu created history by winning the silver medal in Olympics
 The eyes of the Saukor people were set to watch the Rio Olympics in the Olympics
 pivi sindhu olympic ke mahila singles mukaable ke final main pahunch kar pehle hi itihaas rach chukin thi
 But the country was expecting a gold medal from this hawkish daughter
 rio olympic main sindhu ne apane se kai badi oonchi ranking vaali khilaadi ko shikast dekar final main pahunchin thi
 But this time he had the world number one Spaniard Carolina Marin in front of him
 jisase paar paanaa aasaan nahin tha
 But Sindhu showed the game already and won the first 21-19
 haalanki wo pehle pichad raheen thi
 But thanks to the excellent strokes, he took a 1-0 lead
 kaante kii hui takkardusre game main jab donon khilaadi ek duusare saamne utari to phir se ek jabardast mukaabal shuru hua

 However, Janata Dal United leaders say that Nitish Kumar's move was in accordance with his political nature that Chit Bhi Mera and Pat Bhi Mera

 Former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav said after father Lalu Yadav was convicted in the fodder scam, it was all a political conspiracy
 tejasvi ne kaha ki unke pita lalu yadav ke peeche puri bijepi pad gai he
 Lalu Yadav was troubled due to the voices of backward-dalits
 lalu ek vyakti nahin vichaardhaara hai
 The High Court will wait for the opening, the appeal said: It was the decision of the Lower Court to convict Lalu Yadav
 hoicourt jab khulegaa to ham log is faisle ko chunauti denge
 BJP and Nitish Kumar were fully engaged in the decision taken today
 ve chaahate the ki kisi bhi tarah se lalu yadav ko pareshaan karo, jail main daalo or badnaam karo
 This is not a final judgment
 is faisle ke khilaaf ham hoicourt or phir supreme court ja sakate hai
 In the DA case, the lower court gave a judgment in our favor
 iske khilaaf sibiai hoicourt or supremecourt gai, lekin vahaan inhone munh kii khai
 We will also appeal against this decision in a further court
 lalu yadav ke peeche puri party khadi hellalu ji ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he
 This case has been going on for 20 years, but there is no concrete evidence yet
 ham sabhi ekajute hai
 We are against the powers that want to break the country, who do not want to believe in social justice
 lalu ji kaa sirf yahi dosha tha ki ve pichhadi jati se aae
 He fought for social justice
 isiilie na sirf lalu yadav, balki hamaare puure parivaar ke peeche pad gaye hai
 BJP was waiting for Gujarat result BJP-RSS is most afraid of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 tejasvi ne kaha ki gujarat kaa parinaam aane ke baad se aap inaki gatividhiyaan dekhie
 This was being awaited
 gujarat ke rigelt se pehle koi gatividhi nahin thi
 Now as soon as the result comes, these people are not only behind our family but also many leaders of the opposition
 jajment ke takneekee pahaluon ko dekhengebihar kii janata ne man bana liya he
 Now these people are not going to stand anywhere
 lalu ji ke saath puri party, kaaryakarta majbootee ke saath khadey hai
 Lalu ji is not a person but a name of ideology
 lalu yadav dharmanirpekshata or saamaajik nyaay ko saath lekar chalane vaale netaa hai
 We are very sure that Lalu will get a vine
 sirf court band hone ke chalate hamen pareshaani he
 We will focus on some more technical aspects when reading Judgment
 ham logon kaa manobal tuutane vaala nahin he
 If i had compromised, i would have been the Chief Minister, this is a complete conspiracy
 hamane vichaardhaara se samjhauta nahin kiya, agar kar liya hota to ham aaj bihar ke mukhyamantri hote
 Nitish Kumar sold his ideology
 jagannatha mishra ko bel milane ke sawaal par tejasvi ne kaha ki chaara ghotaale main lalu ji ko doshi qaraar diya jaataa he to srijan ghotaale main niteesha kumaar kaise bari ho gaye
 Right now people do not know how many rupees have been withdrawn from the treasury of Bihar
 niteesha jaanate the, lalu ke rahete nahin ban sakate cmye ghotaale kaa cese 1977 kaa he, lekin 90 se pehle vaale sabhi log bari ho gaye
 The person who ordered its investigation was convicted
 niteesha kumaar ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri bananaa tha
 They knew very well that this could not happen under Lalu Yadav
 isiilie raajnneetik shadyantr rachaa gaya
 He was reviled
 shivanand tiwari ne bhi kaha he ki niteesha kumaar ke kehane par hi unhone bayaan diya tha
 After 14th, we will go among people in Bihar
 After 14th, we will go everywhere and tell people the truth
 ye log sachai ko chhipaana chaahate hai
 People say that the party will break now
 lekin ye abhi se nahin balki 1977 se chal rahaa he
 The party is not broken, but is stronger than before
 bihar main sabase badi party hamaari he
 RJD emerged as the single largest party in Bihar's first assembly election
 janata hamaari maalik he, har takalif jhel jaaengejanata hamaari maalik he
 Lalu Yadav lives in the heart of the public
 koi bhi takalif aae ham jhel jaaenge
 But until the person standing on the last floor is brought into the mainstream, our fight will continue
 jetali kaa bayaan doharaaya, ye antim nirnay nahintejasvi yadav ne vitt mantri arun jetali ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki 2ji par jab faisla aayaa to unhone kaha ki ye antim nirnay nahin he

 siem pad kaa durupyog kare to lakhon karod kama saktaa he
 Why would it do for 80 lakhs
 satta ke liye khun bhi kara sakate hainvyapman ghotaale or srijan ghotaale kaa zikr karte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki satta paane ke liye ye log kisi kaa bhi khun kara sakate hai
 Those who can kill Mahatma Gandhi, they can do anything

 So far its information has not been given on the website
 pisi mohanan ne daawa kiya ki rashtriya sankhyikee ayog ne apil kii thi ki aankadon ko janvari main hi sabhi ke saamne jari rakh diya jaae

 haalanki, in aankadon par pisi mohanan ne kisi bhi tarah kii tippanee karne se inkaar kiya
 Seeing the controversy over the matter escalating, the government has called both officials to talk

 The government releases five-year NSSO data every time, but only one-year data is available with the commission

 It is worth mentioning that earlier the Modi government was disgusted by the quarrel of two senior officials in the CBI and the sudden resignation of Urjit Patel from the post of RBI Governor

 The North MCD suspended the school incharge after the religion-based class came to light

 report ke anusaar class-1e main 36 hindu, 1bi main 36 muslim, class-2e main 47 hindu, 2bi main 26 muslim or 15 hindu he
 There are 40 Muslim students in 2C
 dilli sarkaar ne sarkari skulon ke liye di SMC fund ko manzooreebtaa den ki kaksha 1 or 2 kii tarah hi anya kakshaon main bhi hindu or muslim ke aadhaar par section kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya he
 There are only a few sections in the school where Hindu and Muslim students are studying together
 darasal, emsidi skool main paanchavin tak kii padhai karwaai jaati he or har section main 30 bachche hote hai
 However, in-charge of the school, CB Singh Sherawat, has ruled out dividing the section on the basis of religion
 unka kahana he ki section main badlaav ek prakriya he or yah har skool main hota he
 This was the decision of the management and we can see that now there is peace, discipline and learning environment
 bachche kabhi-kabhi ladaai karte the
 How will India study like this? Here the children cross the swimming river in the pot and go to school, while they also said, 'children do not know about religion, but there was a lot of estrangement on many things
 kuch bachche shaakaahaari hai, isliye bhi dooriyaan he
 We have to look into the interest of all teachers and students

 In the tweet it was written, 'the Defense Minister is requested to organize the biggest Arrow India show in November, in Uttar Pradesh

 There is a lot of rhetoric about this in Karnataka

 agar yahaan kaarkaana lagata he to bina kisi shankaa ke bharat main yphone kii keemat bahut kam ho jaaegi or is maidan kii badi khilaadi samsung ko takkar dene main appal ko bhi madad milegi
 This will be a major achievement for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'make in India' campaign, as it will create new employment opportunities

 The BJP is facing a grudge over publishing an article by Congress leader and party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi in the RSS mouthpiece
 lekin duusari ore congress ne ise 'bhartiya samvidhan kii jeet' bataaya he
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi's article is published in the journal 'organizer' supporting BJP

 Eventually he agreed to it

 He said that freedom of the accused and treason are two different things

 Owaisi's statement is embarrassing, although Singhvi in his article has described the disputed statements of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi as shameful but has also written that such cases also do not come under treason
 singhvi ne kaha he ki kanhaiya, umr khalid yaa binayak sen or ovaisi ne jo bhi bolaa vah puri tarah ninda ke laayak he lekin ye bayaan unhen deshadrohi nahin banaate hai
 Nationalism cannot be imposed
 Singhvi recently wrote on the controversy of nationalism which came in the discussion that 'the feeling of nationalism cannot be created in any person, nationalism itself should be in the heart of the person

 ' dalit samudaay kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne SC / ST act ko puraane or mul swaroop main laane kaa faisla kiya he
 The proposal for the SC / ST Act Amendment Bill was approved at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar isi monsoon satr main is sanshodhan vidheyak ko pesh karke phir se act ke mul praavdhaanon ko behaal karegi
 Explain that on 21 March this year, the Supreme Court had stopped the immediate arrest in cases registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act (SC / ST Act 1989)
 court ne faisla dete hue kaha tha ki sarkari karmchaariyon kii giraftaar sirf sakasham athurity kii ijaajat ke baad hi ho sakati he
 Dalit organizations took to the streets on April 2 against the Supreme Court's decision
 dalit samudaay ne do april ko 'bharat band' kiya tha
 The central government was scorched in the heat of protest
 deshbhar main hue dalit andolan main kai ilaakon main hinsa hui thi, jisamen ek darjan logon kii maut ho gai thi
 The Dalit society was expressing its displeasure with the central government, taking the Modi government responsible for the Supreme Court's decision
 centre sarkaar or bijepi ko dalit virdohi bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Dalit organizations have once again given the ultimatum to the government that if by August 9, the SC ST Act is not enacted in the old form, then they will protest in a big way
 modi sarkaar ne daliton kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue SC / ST act ko uske mul swaroop main laane kaa faisla kiya
 If the government brings this amendment to the legislator, it will pass
 dalit maton ko dekhte hue koi iskaa virodh karne vaala nahin he
 Then it will come in its original form and the reshuffle of the Supreme Court will have no meaning
 sanshodhan vidheyak ke baad ye hogasutron kii maane to essi \ asti sanshodhan vidheyak 2018 ke jariye mul kanoon main dhara 18 a jodi jaaegi
 Through this, the old law will be restored
 is tareeke se supreme court ke kiye praavdhaan radd ho jaaenge or ab ye praavdhaan hoga--essi / asti act main cese darj hote hi giraftaar kaa praavdhaan he-aaropee ko agrim jamaanat nahin mil sakegi, hoicourt se hi niyamit jamaanat mil sakegi
 - Investigation in the case of SC / ST will be done by the police officer of the rank of Inspector
 -jatisuchak shabdon ke istemaal sambandhi shikaayat par turant maamla darj hoga
 SC / ST cases will be heard only in special courts
 -sarkari karmchaaree ke khilaaf adaalat main chargeshit daayar karne se pehle jaanch agency ko athurity se ijaajat nahin leni hogi
 The Supreme Court had made these changes - in cases of SC / ST Act, immediate arrest will not be made
 -shikaayat milane par turant mukadmaa darj nahin kiya jayega
 Initial investigation will be done by DSP level police officer after first getting the complaint
 -jaanch kisi bhi surat main 7 din se zyada samay tak na ho
 The DSP will conduct preliminary investigation and conclude that according to the complaint, whether a case is made or is being falsely implicated in some way? Government servants can apply for anticipatory bail
 -essi / asti act ke tahat jatisuchak shabd istemaal karne ke aaropee ko jab magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya jaae, to us vakt unhen aaropee kii hiraasat badhaane kaa faisla lene se pehle giraftaar kii vajahon kii samiksha kerani thi
 - The arrest of government employees can be done only after the permission of the competent authority
 -disha-nirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne vaale afasaron ko vibhageeya karrwai ke saath adaalat kii avmaananaa kii kaarywahi kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 But now Modi government is going to reverse this decision through the bill and this will bring SC / ST in its original form
 australia ke purv tej gendbaaj michel johnson ne puraane dinon ko yaad karte hue bataaya he ki unki or harfanmaulaa khilaadi shen watson kii lambii dosti kii shuruyaat kis tarah hui thi
 Johnson has said that Watson once hit his head with a toilet while both were training at the Cricket Academy in Adelaide
 johnson ne watson kaa sir toilet se takaraa diya thasaal 2000 main is academy kecoch rodni marshathe or ian chapel, denis lily evam jon inverarity jaise diggaj unhen prashikshan dene aate the
 Johnson says that during this period, everyone gathered to watch the drama 'never' and used to wrestle during commercials
 johnson ne apni jeevani 'risilent' main likhaa he, 'har raat dinar se pehle ham sabhi ek kamare main 'nevars' naatak dekhne ikattha hote the
 Whenever there was an advertisement in the middle of the play, all the wrestling started fighting and it went on till the play started again
 'johnson ne apni khitaab main khole kai rajjansonlikhte hai, 'ek din kushti ke dauraan kuch ladakon ne mujhe khinchaa or daravaaje tak le gaye or phir kisi ne meraa sar toilet main maaraa tha

 Parliament has been told by the Union Home Ministry on Tuesday that 'jinnah House' in Mumbai has not been listed as 'enemy property'
 karnal se saansad ashvini kumaar kii ore se loksabhaa main puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir ne kaha,‘mohammad ali jinna kaa awaas shatru sampatti adhinium, 1968 ke daayre main nahin aata
 Jinnah House is the property of the Government of India and there is no question of its disposal
 ’ahir ne saaf kiya ki jinna house ek ‘ivacui property’ he jo ivacui property act, 1950 ke daayre main aati he
 Jinnah House has been involved in a legal dispute since 2010
 jinna kii iklauti santan dina wadiya ne bombai hoicourt main yachika daakhil kar is bahumoolya sampatti par daawa kiya tha
 Dina Wadia had said in the petition that she is the sole heir of Jinnah so she should get the rights over the property
 malabar hill par dhai acre main faile is bangale ke bare main daawa kiya gaya tha ki uskaa haq jinna kii bahan fatima jinna ko de diya gaya he
 Dina Wadia died on 2 November 2017 in New York
 gauratlab he ki jinna ke banaae is bangale kaa sarkaar ne ivacui property ke taur par adhigrahan kar liya
 All rights over the bungalows of such Evacuey and others have ended
 ateet main bijepi netaa maang karte rahe hai ki jinna house ko ‘shatru sampatti’ghoshit kiya jaae
 Evacuee means' any person who has left India or Pakistan during the existence of sovereignty or for fear of civil disturbances or such disturbances, or the territories under India on or after 1 March 1947
 Has gone out or is living in any part of Pakistan
 is kaaran se wo vyakti ivacui act ke daayre main aane vaale kisi bhi kshetra main sthit sampatti par kabje, nigaraanee yaa prabandhan kaa hakdaar nahin rahegaa
 Two months ago, there was a fierce dispute over the portrait in the hall of the students' union of Pakistan's founder, Jinnah Ke Aligarh Muslim University
 dakshinpanthi jinna ke potrate ko hataane kii maang kar rahe the
 BJP MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam also sent a letter in this regard to the Chancellor of Aligarh University
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill ek khatarnaak bill he
 The bill strikes at the basic concept of the Indian nation state
 yah us prastaavna kii khilli udaata he jo har bhartiya naagarik ko dharm, jati, bhashaa yaa kisi bhi bhedbhaav se pare har tarah kii samta kaa adhikaar detii he
 Because this bill proposes citizenship for some people on the basis of religion for the first time, and speaks of excluding some people on this basis
 yah kaanoon is desh ke diene ko badalane kii koshish he
 Certainly within a nation, it is necessary to sensitize that if someone seeks refuge for valid reasons, he should be given asylum
 azaadi ke baad isi maanviya aadhaar par bharat ne dalai lamas ko sharan hi nahin di, unako nirvasit sarkaar ke liye jagah bhi di
 Such a refuge requires political will, no new law
 lekin sarkaar jo kaanoon laa rahi he usamen un avaidh pravaasiyon ko naagarikta dene kaa praavdhaan hoga jo hindu, sikh, isai, buddha, jain yaa parsi honge
 If for some valid reason - plagued by any form of oppression - any Muslim wants this refuge then he will not get it
 iske liye philhal 2014 ke saal kii miyaad tay kii gai he
 That is, those who are illegal migrants before 2014 will get this citizenship, but on the basis of this, will not such migrants want asylum in the coming days? The logic of the government and BJP mps who introduced this bill is strange
 unka kahana he ki baaqi dharmon ke liye to bahut saare desh hai, hinduon ke liye sirf bharat he
 This seems to be the argument of not a political party, but a religious group
 phir is tark main bhi daraaren hai
 In which country of the world are Hindus not getting a place? The truth is that Indian people are the biggest expatriates in the world today - that is, they are getting citizenship in most other countries or their applications are there
 sanyukt raashtra kii jansankhwa shakha ne pichley dinon jo aankade jari kiye, unke mutabik qareeb paune do karod bhartiya duusare deshon main rah rahe hai
 Obviously, a large number of them belong to Hindu Indians
 bharat ke baad mexico vah doosraa desh he jiske naagarik duusare deshon main hai- magar bas ek karod das lakh
 China and back
 apni sharnaarthi majaburiyon ke liye charchit syria bhi is maamle main peeche he
 So the argument that in which country Hindus will find a place is nothing more than a blatant lie and emotional trepidation
 duniya bhar main bhartiya ja rahe hai or jagah paa rahe hai

 purvi dilli ke gajipur main shuukravaar shaam hue haadase ne kai sawaal khadey kiye hai
 But if there is anyone responsible for the accident, then it is the Municipal Corporation of Delhi ie MCD
 kyonki vahi hua jiskaa dar lambe vakt se tha
 The Ghazipur landfill site, which has been standing like a time bomb for years, exploded on Friday and a part of the landfill site came down with a shock on Friday
 landphil site se thik lagi hui sadak par yatayaat tha or vahaan se guzar rahi gaadiyaan or log isaki chapet main aa gaye
 Two people died and 4 were injured in the accident
 is haadase kii agali subah 'aaj tak' kii team ne ye pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki is haadase kaa asal jimmedaar koun he or jo vajahen saamne ain usamen sabhi ungliyaan emsidi kii taraf uthati dikhin
 When we look at the accident, we will find that this accident could have been prevented but the loose attitude of the MCD caused an accident that shook the whole of Delhi
 aapako bataa den ki gajipur landphil site 1984 main shuru kii gai thi
 It is estimated that it was built only till 2002
 2002 main is landphil site ko band ho janaa chahie tha lekin miyaad khatm ho jane ke 15 saal baad tak is landphil site par kooda daalaa jaataa rahaa jisase sirf 20 meter unchai kii manjuuri vaali ye landphil site aaj 50 meter kii unchai tak pahunch chuki he
 It is not that the corporation was not warned for this
 dilli pradooshan niyantran samiti yani dipisisi ne kai baar east emsidi ko patr likh chetavanee di thi ki gajipur main ab or kooda nahin daale lekin emsidi ke kaan par jun tak nahin rengi
 If you tell another story of negligence, you will also be convinced that why it will be considered as a big negligence of MCD
 darasal dilli main land didie uplabdh karaata he or gajipur landphil site ke vikalp ke taur par east emsidi ko purvi dilli ke ghonda gurjaan main didm kii khaali padi lagbhag 150 acre jameen kii sahmati bhi di ja chuki he or 4 sitambar ko ise lekar east emsidi adhikariyon or meyar kii didie afasaron ke saath baithak bhi tay he lekin vidambnaa dekhie vakt par yahaan landphil site naa ban paane kaa khamiyaja do logon kii jaan dekar chukaana padaa
 Third big carelessness also tells you
 
 
 pichley saal november main east emsidi ne neshnal hive athurity ke saath qaraar kiya tha jiske tahat gajipur landphil site se kooda nikaal kar enech-24 ke chaudaakaran main uskaa istemaal hona tha
 But the plan could not proceed beyond the agreement
 aakhirkaar do logon kii maut ke baad prashasan kii neend tuuti he
 The next day of the accident i
e
 Saturday, the Lt
 Governor held a meeting with the East Delhi Commissioners and officials as well as NHAI officials and decided that from November 2017, the waste will be picked up from the landfill site and used for NH-24 and the next two The garbage dump from Ghazipur will be completely eradicated in years
 ab bada sawaal ye he ki jab ye haadasa roka ja saktaa tha to phir isamen deree kyon hui or ab jab do logon kii jaan ja chuki he to us parmuaavje kaa marahamalgane kii asafal koshish kii ja rahi he
