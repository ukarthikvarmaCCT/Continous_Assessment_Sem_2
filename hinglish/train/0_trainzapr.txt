 "I have a plan," when Justice Ranjan Gogoi said while addressing the young lawyers at a lecture of the Youth Bar Association in New Delhi on September 29, just three days before assuming the chair of the Chief Justice of India (CJI)
 So everyone's head shook
 nyaayadhish gogoi ne kaha ki do chijen unhen bahut pareshaan karti hai
 First, "pending cases" in the courts and second "how to bring justice to the people suffering from poverty
" '' jab unhone kaha ki main apni kaaryayojna ko amal main laane ke liye "sabake sahyogy kii apil karata hum, to auditorium taaliyon kii gadgadahat se gunj uthaa

 The sanctioned strength of judges in the Supreme Court is 31, but currently the court has to work with only 25 judges, six less than the sanctioned number and more than 31,000 new cases are flooded every month
 sabase badhibia samaybeshak desh ke pradhan nyaayadhish hone kaa yah sabase acha samay he
 With 20 high-profile rulings in five days, just a week before Gogoi took over as CJI, the Supreme Court has changed the course of consultation in the country
 aadhaar se lekar vyabhichaar tak, aapraadhik prishthbhumi ke netaaon se lekar naagarik kaaryakartaaon tak, ram janmabhumi se sabarimala or pramotion main kota ke live strimming tak, bharat adalati faislon ko lekar uttejnaa se bharaa or utsahit dikhataa he
 In the last week of September, the Supreme Court through its decisions has interfered with matters related to the lives of the common people, which has never happened before in this country
 is behad garm maahaul ke bich ek baat par logon kaa dhyaan hi nahin gaya vah thi supreme court main hi nae sijei kii niyukti ko chunauti dene vaali ek yachika
 a case in the long list of daily trial cases in Court No 1 on 26 September was also related to the cancellation of the decision to appoint Justice Gogoi to the post of CJI
 do "interlocutary aplication'' ke jariye yachikakarta ne kaha tha ki justise gogoi ne 12 janvari ko ek press conference karke adaalat main "aantarik matbhed'' ke naam par "saarvajanik rup se bhram paidaa karne'' kii koshish kii or "nyaayik ayogyata or anuchit aacharan'' kaa parichay diya
 Therefore, his appointment should be banned
 "interlocutary aplication'' aise maamalon par tatkaal raahat kii apil ke liye lagaae jate hai jahaan kanoon ke dakhal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The application was dismissed by CJI Deepak Mishra with a cryptic comment "the calm of the ocean is better than anything else"
 kadasijei gogoi sakht mizaaj samajhe jate haih sijei kaa pad sanbhaalane se thik chah din pehle lagaai gai ek yachika main jis bindu ko ukera gaya tha usase unke mizaaj kaa andaja ho jaataa he
 Six months before his name was recommended as CJI, a parliamentary committee starts talking about raising the retirement age of Supreme Court judges by two years, a move that would lead to Justice Gogoi's chances of becoming a CJI
 Could have ended; Before the recommendation of Justice Gogoi's name as the next CJI by CJI Mishra on 4 September, there were common whispers in the corridors of power that he dared to create turmoil for the Narendra Modi government, the mystery of a CBI judge Pointing fingers at the top political leadership to the death, daring to openly say that "democracy in India is in danger
" ''mukhya nyaayadhish bharat ke supreme court ke centre main hote hai
 Theoretically, the CJI may be the "first among equal empowered judges", but is in fact the pivot of the court

 It is the CJI that, with a clear understanding of both workload and output, improves the courtroom, controls the flood of dockets and can make any changes at any time — for that reason, Justice Gogoi and his The allies had burnt the revolt against Justice Deepak Mishra at a press conference on 12 January
 sijei ke saamne yah sunishchit karne kii bhi chunauti he ki collegium banta hua na dikhe
 This is not an easy task, as both the structure and dynamics of the collegium responsible for important court decisions are likely to change repeatedly during CJI Gogoi's tenure

 Law scholar and author of Law and Other Things, Nick Robinson points out that the number of cases in the Supreme Court is increasing inconsistently compared to the High Courts and the lower courts, which is a matter of concern

 Everyone's eyes are now on the Supreme Court: Will the sea really be calm? Or will any such wave arise in different parts of the country that will disturb this peace? CJI Gogoi once said, "the independent and the voice of judges are the first line of protection of democracy

 What are these vocational training centers? The media of the west calls them Concentration Camps
 lekin china ko is par sakht aapatti he
 Experts and officials here have a view that sending Ughar Muslims who do not have serious cases of terror against them to these vocational centers is right
 isse unhen diradicalaaj karne main aasaani hoti he or wo koi naa koi kaam sikh kar sarkaar kii di aarthik madad ke zarie ek saamaanya chini naagarik ke taur par jeevanyaapan kar sakate hai
 It does not sound bad, unless you go and talk to the people living in these centers yourself
 baat karne ke baad adhikariyon kii baat sirf daleel lagane lagati he
 At least that's what i thought
 shinjiyang ke adhikariyon ne ham patrakaron ko do vokational training centre dikhaae
 Took it there vahaan maujuud trainiyon se, shikshakon se baat karne di
 However, two important things that you should know are the language problem and the presence of officials
 asal main shinjiyang ke adhiktar uighar, uighar bhashaa bolte hai
 An interpreter or interpreter translates it into Mandarin and an interpreter who knows Mandarin and English translates it into English for us
 isliye in centaron main hameshaa hamane is baat kii koshish kii ki anuwaad eemaandaaree se ho or kahin kuch Lost in Translation naa ho
 Secondly, we have had many Chinese officers, especially at least 12 to 15 in these centers
 to kya inaki maujuudagi kisi tarah se in centaron main rakhe gaye uighar logon ke bayanon ko prabhavit kar rahi thi
 The first Vocational Training Center we were taken to was named Wensu County Vocational Skills Training Center
 shahar se baahar, bas se kareeb 40 minute kii duuri par ek bada ilaaka or charadivari ke andar kuch behad saamaanya lagane vaali imaaraten
 a few youths were seen playing basketball on the basketball court on the right hand side with the entrances
 main unka video bananaa chaahati thi, unase baat karnaa chaahati thi lekin saath main maujuud chini adhikariyon ne kaha ki ye game karikulam kaa hissaa he, bich main nahin roak sakate, baad main inase baat karne kaa mauka milegaa
 Inside, she was first taken to a dance class where some Uighur Muslim youth performed traditional and modern dance
 phir ham ek class main gaye jahaan mandarin padhaayaa ja rahaa tha
 We asked students permission to ask some questions
 kai chaatro se baat hui- camere par bhi or bina camere ke bhi, dubhashie ke zarie
 We asked them what crimes they were brought here for
 ye aparaadh hai quran padhanaa, hijaab pahananaa, bina license ke nikaah karnaa, phone par jihadi video dekhnaa yaa downlod karnaa, avaidh jagahon par dharm par jaankaree sunanaa, sarkari madad lene se manaa karnaa, gharavaalon ko tivi dekhnaa gaiyr islamic bataanaa, ghar kii mahilaon ko gaiyr islamic bataa kar mechap lagane se manaa karnaa vagairah
 Talking to them and officials, it seems that in all cases, someone reported them to the police
 lekin ye bhi lagata he ki jab koi akele, apane phone par koi video dekh rahaa ho, to kisi or ko kaise pataa chalaa? isamen shankaa ye hoti he ki kya yahaan logon kii online gatividhiyaan par Electronically bhi nazar rakhi ja rahi he?lekin sabase badi baat kya he is centre par? wo ye ki yahaan par 'training kar rahe kam se 99 fisad uighar muslim ye kehete hai ki ab wo islam main vishwaas nahin karte
 Do not pray any kind
 kisi dharm main vishwaas nahin karte
 So the question arises that what happened after all those who were leaning towards extremist Islam completely abandoned religion
 poochne par ye kehete hai ki inhen apni galati samaj main aa gai he
 But this was not understood by me and many journalists present there
 kya diradicalizeshan puri tarah se dharm kaa tyaag kar dena he yaa atvaad se dur hatana he? duniya main kahin or bhi aisa hota he? aakhir yahaan aisa kya samajhaayaa-bujhaayaa gaya ki in logon ne dharm hi chhod diya? hamane inase ye bhi poocha ki kyonki china main kisi bhi skool college main kisi bhi dharmik gatividhi kii manaahi he, to kya chhuttiyon main jab ghar jate hai to namaaz padhte hai yaa masjid jate hai? do-teen ke alaava sabakaa jawaab tha- nahin
 a journalist even asked if you are tortured to which he started laughing and said no
 lekin tab bhi sawaal ye bana hua he ki yahaan par diradicalizeshan kaa matlab kya dharm khatm karnaa hota he? ye in uigar muslimon kaa apana faisla he yaa thopa hua? or ye faisla sach main vishwaas khatm hone ke kaaran he yaa zindagi aasaan karne kaa tarika? Working longer and sleeping less can prove dangerous to your heart health
 ek nae adhyayan main yah khulaasa hua he
 Fire and emergency medical services, resident doctors and other people with high stress work are asked to work in 24-hour shifts, which gives them less sleep time
 germany ke uniwarsity of bon main adhyayan ke mukhya lekhak daniel kueting ne kaha ki pehali baar, hamane yah khulaasa kiya he ki 24 ghante kii shift ke sandarbh main kam neend lene vaale logon ke cardiyak contractility (dil ke sikudne kii swaabhaavik kshamta), raktchaap tathaa heart rate main aswabhaavik badhotaree hoti he

 He said that this conclusion will help us understand how work load and shift hours affect people's lives
 yah nishkarsh chicago main radiological sosayadi of north america (aresaine) kii salanaa baithak main pesh kiya gaya
 Danielle Kuetting, lead author of the study at the University of Bonn, Germany, said that for the first time, we have revealed that cardiac contractility (the natural ability of the heart to shrink), blood pressure and blood pressure in people with less sleep in the context of a 24-hour shift
 There is an unnatural increase in heart rate
 tippaniyan Kuating and his colleagues averaged 31 in the study

 Cardio Vascular Magnetic Resonance was performed before and after a 24-hour shift for every participant who took an average of three hours of sleep
 shodhakartaaon ne pratibhaagiyon ke rakt va mutr ke namoonay bhi ikattha kiye or raktchaap tathaa heart rate ko mapa gaay
 Blood pressure and heart rate were found to be higher in the short-term sleeping participants
 unhone kaha ki yah nishkarsh yah samajhane main hamaari madad karegaa ki kaam kaa bhaar tathaa shift ke ghante kis prakaar logon ke jivan ko prabhavit karte hai

 ‘achche din aane vaale hai’
 
 
 Do not be surprised, here the talk of Narendra Modi's campaign in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections is not being discussed, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is talking here
 darasal badrinaath mandir ke pujari ne rahul gandhi se mil kar kaha he ki unke achche din aane vaale hai
 Rahul Gandhi, who has described himself as a Judeaudhari Hindu Brahmin, Rudrakshadhari Shiva devotee, now met the priest of the Badrinath temple
 mulaakaat main baqayada patri ke saath aaye pujari ne rahul ko bataaya ki, ‘ab aane vaala vakt acha he, khaskar 2019 chunaav main acha samay rahegaa
 The priest of Badrinath came to Rahul with many old photographs
 pujari ne bataaya ki jawahar laal nehru, indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi kaa puja-paath badrinaath mandir main unke pita ne hi karaayaa tha
 When Rahul's grandmother Indira Gandhi went to the Badrinath temple, the priest also showed her pictures of her with her father to Rahul
 isi ke saath pujari ne rahul ko badrinaath darshan ke liye aane ko bhi kaha
 Rahul went on a Kedarnath yatra in 2015 and walked ten kilometers
 abhi haal main unhone kaha he ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav khatm hone ke baad ve kailash maansarovar kii yatra par jaaenge
 Be it the Gujarat election campaign or the Karnataka election campaign, Rahul has been seen visiting various temples and monasteries

 According to the priest, he was invited by Rahul Gandhi's office, after which he came to meet Rahul as a priest of the Gandhi family in the Badrinath temple
 beete saal gujarat chunaav ke dauraan rahul soft hindutv kii line par chalate najar aae
 However, Rahul said that he had been a devotee from the beginning and had gone on a Kedarnath yatra in 2015, long before the Gujarat elections
 darasal, 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii haar ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye party ke varisht netaa eke antni kii aguai main cameti kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 One of the reasons for the defeat was told by the Antony Committee that the Congress and the Gandhi family were accused of Muslim appeasement for having an anti-hindu image
 isi ke baad rahul ne kedarnath kii yatra kii or phir lagaataar rahul kuch aisa karte najar aate he ki unki chhavi badali hui dikhe
 In such a situation, after visiting Kailash Mansarovar, 'shiv bhakt' Rahul can also go to Badrinath Darshan in the coming time

 The story of Beintha Pyaar Ki, shown in the 1997 Hollywood film Titanic, is still alive in people's minds
 20 saal baad bhi log jaik or roj ke adhure pyaar kii kami mahasoos karte hai
 After the ship's sinking in the film's climax, Jack lives in an icy sea to save Rose
 20 saalon main darshakon ke man main kai baar yah sawaal uthaa ki kya jaik ko bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha? film dekhne ke baad aam darshak chahta tha ki jaik jinda batch jaataa to behatar tha
 For 20 years this question is also being asked by the director of the film
 jaik mara kyon?20 saal baad kyon ho rahi he titannic kii charchaahal hi main khabar ai he ki yah popular film titannic ab 3D main bhi aegi
 Recently a new trailer of Titanic has been launched
 jisamen film ke nirdeshak james camerun is bare main bataa rahe hai
 The film will be released on 1 December
 lekin ise sirf america main hi dekha ja sakegaa
 In India it can be seen online only
 america ke AMR theatres main yah film ek saptaah tak dikhaai jaaegi
 What did the director of Titanic say? In an interview to Vanity Fair, the film's director James Cameron spoke openly about the climax scene
 jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki ki samandar main doobane ke dauraan kya lakdi ke daravaaje par jaik ke liye jagah nahin banaai ja sakati thim? kya jaik nahin ko bachaaya ja saktaa tha? nirdeshak kaa jawaab tha, 'yah isliye nahin hua kyonki jaik ko maranaa hi tha
 The film was about dying and falling apart
 agar jaik jinda rahata to film kaa ant arthhin ho jaataa
 'titanic's new trailer, to be released again after 20 years,' Cameron said, clearly written on the 147th page of the script that Jack dies
 jaik kii maut kaa faisla kala kii drushti se kiya gaya tha
 He said, that door was able to save only one person
 vah do logon kaa vajan nahin sambhaal paata
 Even after 20 years people question me about this, it seems very childish to me
 lekin isse yah bhi sabit hota he ki titannic itani asardaar film rahi ki jaik ke marane se log dukhi ho gaye
 He said, Jack had to die
 agar vah is tareeke se nahin marataa to phir us par jahaaj kaa koi bada tukdaa girtaa
 Jack didn't know that after 1 hour he would come to save the lifeboat
 20 saal baad titannic, ye delit seen kar degaa imotionalvahin titannic ke craij ko dekhte hue khabar he ki iskaa bengali main rimek banaaya jayega

 52013 main ai court room drama movie jolly elelbi main arshad varsi or saurabh shukla kii jodi ne darshakon ko khub anterten kiya tha
 The pair has again returned to Fraud Saiyaan with a comedy dose
 ladakiyon ko apane jaal main fansaakar unase shaadi karne kii is frodgiri par kai filmein ban chuki hai
 In such a situation, it must have been a challenge for the director how they could serve this worn-out content in front of the audience afresh
 isamen ve thode bahut safal bhi hue hai
 Know how this film is made of Arshad Warsi and Saurabh Patel, famous for comic roles
 kya he film kii kahani?movie kii kahani bholaa prasad treepathi (arshad varsi) kii he, jo apane naam ke bilkul ulat he
 His job is to marry a girl with money into his trap
 uski jindagi kaa ek hi makasad he, sindur baro or rupee kamao
 Unemployed Bhola fools his wives and asks them for money
 uski 1,2 nahin balki 12 biviyaan hai
 This house-to-house game of Bhola was going well, but then Murari (saurabh Shukla) enters his life as Shani
 jo ki bholaa kii hi ek bivi kaa rishtedaar he or detective bhi
 Murari comes to know Bhola's fraud
 wo uskaa pardaafash karne kii koshish karata he lekin khud hi funs jaataa he
 Murari then decides to make Bhola a friend and teach him a lesson
 ab kaise murari dosti kii aad main bholaa ke kachche chitthey kholta he? kaise bholaa kii sari patniyon ke saamne sach aata he, ye sab jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Acting Saurabh Shukla and Arshad Warsi are the lives of this simple story
 donon actors ne acha kaam kiya he
 Saurabh Shukla's comic timing is tremendous
 kuch ek seens main ve arshad varsi par baari pade hai
 Sara Lauren looks beautiful
 unka kaam acha he
 Apart from Arshad warsi-saurabh Shukla, other artists just come and go
 kyon dekhni chahie filirshad varsi or saurabh patel jaise manze hue kalakaaron kii acting ke liye film dekhi ja sakati he
 Many scenes filmed between the two are quite interesting and funny
 film kii sabase acchhee baat ye he ki sidhi sapaat kahani hone ke baavjood ye darshakon ko kaaphi had tak baandhe rakhane main kaamyaab rahati he
 The climax of the movie is surprising

 The makers of comedy such as Arshad Warsi and Saurabh Patel were not able to take good advantage of the makers
 kahani or antertaning ho sakati thi
 The lack of comic punch and dialogues is unambiguous
 mekars ne kamedi main kuch nayaa tri nahin kiya
 At the same time have resorted to old worn out funds and jokes

 Communication skills are the most important for any profession
 jab tak aap achche se communicket nahin kar paaenge aapaki growth nahin hogi
 Follow these methods for better communication skills: 1
 sahi communication ke liye sabase pehle apni body language ko jaj karnaa shuru karen
 Is it not that you are speaking something and your body language is saying something else? 2
 Always be calm and comfortable
 baton main kisi bhi prakaar kaa takiya kalam hameshaa jodne kii koshish na karen
 If you do this then there will be negative impact on the front
 3
 Choosing the right words during a conversation improves your communication skills
 jaise hi aap shabdon ke chayan par dhyaan dene lagenge vaise hi log aapaki baton ko dhyaan se sunanaa shuru kar denge
 4
 baat karne ke dauraan yah jaane ki aap kisase baat kar rahe hai
 The way you talk with everyone can be different
 jab aap ek bachche ke saath baat karte hai to alag tarah ke communication kaa sahaara lete hai
 In the office, we have to resort to professional communication skills
 5
 Talking to point to point will be easy both for you and the person in front
 isliye baat karte samay is baat kaa khaas dhyaan den
 6
 baat karne ke dauraan sirf bolne par hi dhyaan na den
 Also listen to the words of others
 aisa mana jaataa he ki vahi acha vaktaa ban saktaa he, jo acha shrota hota he
 7
 sabase zyada jaruri he ki jo bolen us par vishwaas karnaa seekhen
 It is not that while talking, cut your own words repeatedly

 Om Namah shivaya According to Linga Purana, the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearer - the oval shaped stone is resembling mark of the Universe and bottom base as the Supreme Power holding the entire Universe in it
 Similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana: "the endless sky (that great void which contains the entire universe) is the Linga, the Earth is its base
 At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself
 "in yogic lore, the linga is considered the first form to arise when creation occurs, and also the last form before the dissolution of creation
 It is therefore seen as an access to Shiva or that which lies beyond physical creation

 If you have to persuade the hero to work in the film, then obviously his role has to be longer than the heroine
 aakhirkaar filmein usee ke naam se to chalati hai
 This is how to tell your story within such a conditional framework
 har produsar ko ek khaas trek taiyaar rakhana hota he, jisamen hero kii date ke hisaab se pherbadal kiya jaataa he
 The heroine's turn comes later, which is enough to woo the superstar
 super star ko ‘suut’ karne vaali heroin bahut kam hai or usamen bhi pratispardhaa bahut kadi he
 Mainstream big-budget films are usually crafted in a similar structure
 isliye bollywood main auraton ko pesh kiye ja rahe tareeke par kadi najar daalana or bhi jaruri tathaa mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 The surrounding conditions are also against any change in the female character 
 darshakon kii bhoomika isamen bahut ahm he
 So one has to think about them as well
 main shfilmein samaaj kaa aainaa hoti hai’ kii soch ko nahin maanati
 Movies are a complete entertainment item
 paise kharch kar cinemaghar main aa rahaa shaks ‘70 mem’ kaa aainaa dekhne katai nahin aata
 Anyway, this is such an art, which says on Dunke's injury that the audience is the mother-father for this
 upanyaas lekhan se filmon kii raah par chal padane ke baad sabase pehla dhakka mujhe tab laga, jab maine khullam-khulla darshakon ko khush karne kii daleelein sunin
 My footsteps had turned in a completely different direction from the meaningful-elegant gatherings of renowned litterateurs in Delhi, where books are considered to be 'karma' entrusted not to entertain, but to brainstorm for readers
 film dekhne pahunchane vaale logon main zyaadaatar chehre mard hote hai or vahi rahenge
 Men and women can look almost equal in multiplexes
 lekin isse koi mugalata na paalen
 100 crores Rs
 kaa bijness paar karne ke liye filmon ko single screen cinemagharon main kaamyaab hona padataa he jahaan bahusankhyak darshak purush hote hai
 The feeling of insecurity among women in public places is directly reflected in the male-female ratio of the crowd going to see the film
 tivi ke kaarykram stri kendrit hai, jinka anand ghar ke surakshit or nishchit maahaul main uthaaya ja saktaa he, jahaan swaabhaavik rup se mahila darshak hi maujuud hai
 But the call for change is heard
 kaamkaaj ke morche par mahilaon kii bhagidaari bad rahi he or ve aarthik faisle lene lagi hai
 Films like english-vinglish and Kahani not only entertained, but also earned money
 filmon ke asar kaa akalan karnaa to uchit he, lekin hamaare bich gum rahe jaanavar kii prakruti ko samajhane main ho rahi chook kaa kya? samay he badlaav kii aisi jameen taiyaar karne kaa, jahaan jadon se maanviyata kaa ankur phute or aagaaj hamase hi ho
 What's easy for me then? Today to become burdensome under your own burden and to be the Messiah of tomorrow's change? Whatever it is, i will write the story i want to write
 film bane yaa na bane

 This bill has been approved by the cabinet last week
 in doctoron kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne apane is ahm bill par saal bhar se kam vakt main hi hi you turn kar liya
 According to him, the blueprint of the bill was kept to know public opinion last year and the bill passed by the cabinet is completely different
 pichley prastaavit bill main commercial sarogesi kaa praavdhaan tha or saroget maa ke liye muaavje kii baat bhi thi
 In its two-page open letter, the Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction has said that the government has brought this law in a hurry and it should be withdrawn

 According to the provision in this bill, only a close family member can be a surrogate mother and married couple can apply for surrogacy only after five years of marriage
 doctor in donon hi bandishon ko galat bataa rahe hai
 Dr
 Shivali Sachdev, who runs IVF and surrogacy clinic in Delhi, says, "the government should enact a law that is not made by looking at one percent of celebrities but 99 percent of common people, rather than a bill
 agar aap kehete hai ki ki saroget madar parivaar main hi honi chaiye to 99% parivaar main to aisi koi ladi hi nahin he jo saroget madar ban sake
 Our patient comes and says that privacy is most important in his family
 use ham kaise chhod sakate hai or abhi agar kisi maa ko sarogesi ke liye paisa nahin denge to baad main kya keemat chukaani padegi
 " cabinet se bill paas hone ke baad sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vah kokh kiraaye par lene ke bazaar ko rokane ke liye ye praavdhaan laa rahi he taaki farjivada roka ja sake lekin ab yah sawaal uthaaya ja rahaa he ki kya zaruuratmand jodon ko parivaar ke bheetar koi saroget milegi or un jodon kaa kya hoga jo apane bachche kii paidaayash kii prakriya ko gopneey rakhana chaahate hai? shaadi ke baad 5 saal tak intjaar ke praavdhaan par yah sawaal he ki agar kisi kii shaadi der main hoti he to 5 saal kaa intjaar puraa hote hote prajnan kshamta hi khatm ho sakati he
 The provision to use a woman's womb for money by paying money was abolished when this bill was sent to the Group of Ministers this year
 isiemr kii nideshak dow saumya swaminathan kahati hai ki sarkaar kisi ko sarogesi se roak nahin rahi he lekin kisi kii garibi kaa phayda uthaakar uske sharir kaa istemaal karne se roka ja rahaa he
 There has been talk of foreign couples coming to India and using women in the name of surrogacy
 "hamaare paas aisi misaal hai jahaan videshi jode baahar se aakar sarogesi ke liye bhartiya mahilaon kaa istemaal karte hai
 Many times these women do not get the amount of money they are asked to pay for surrogacy later, and much less is paid
 ek japani jode ne garbh ke dauraan hi aapas main ek duusare se rishta tod liya or phir us bachche ko kisi anathashram main le janaa padaa kyonki japani sarkaar sarogesi ko manyata nahin detii
 "comments sarogesi bill ko lekar jo group of ministar kaa gathan kiya gaya uski pramukh videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj thi or usamen swasthya mantri ke alaava vaanijya rajya mantri bhi the
 But Tajub is also aware that the important women and child welfare minister was not a member of this group

 i was not consulted on this bill
 " However, in the Winter Session of Parliament this bill will be presented in one House and sent to the Standing Committee
 phir standing cameti tamaam pakshon se vaarta kar bill main sanshodhan sujhaayegi
 That is, the path of the bill is long and difficult but the government has also said that it will not give much explanation on the provision of commercial surrogacy

 During this, Delhi State Secretary Dilip Pandey of Aam Aadmi Party was present in the office along with 15-20 workers

 The attackers are said to be related to an organization called Hindu Raksha Dal

 The attackers are believed to have been shocked by AAP leader Prashant Bhushan's statement on Kashmir
 gauratlab he ki prashanth ne aaj tak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main kaha tha ki kashmir main suraksha balon ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale kanoon 'afspa' par raishumaari kii jaani chahie
 However, later Arvind Kejriwal said it was Prashant's personal opinion, saying that the party did not agree with it
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ne phone par bataaya ki hamalavar shuru se hi narebaaji or bhaddi bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 AAP workers locked themselves in the room to avoid any dispute
 yahaan suraksha kaa koi intjaam nahin tha
 No injuries have been reported in the attack, but the ground floor and the outside verandah have been vandalized
 sisitivi footage main najar aa rahaa he ki bhagava jhande liye kuch log narebaaji kar rahe hai or inte oochaal rahe hai
 The banner which is visible in his hand has 'hindu Raksha Dal' written on it
 binar par likhaa he, 'doodh maangoge to kheer denge, kashmir maangoge to cheer denge
 AAP leader Dilip Pandey said that the attackers were armed with sticks and stones
 agar samay rahete kaaryakartaaon ko andar na liya hota, to kaiyon ko chot lag sakati thi
 According to Dileep, the attackers were a Hindu defense party organization
 unhone kaha, 've log gaali-galouj kar rahe the
 We have his CCTV footage
 ve insaaniyat or desh ke rakshak kabhi nahin ho sakate
 It is not worth the apology
 ham kadi se kadi sajaa kii maang karte hai

 The convicts argued that the plea of the other prisoners who filed mercy petition after them was decided first, but their petitions were kept pending by the government

 At a time when post offices are being closed in different parts of the country and the world
 log chitthiyaan likhane ke bajaay fasebuk, twitor or whatsap par acount bana rahe hon
 We can send a message to someone with a stroke today, but it was not always so
 kisi jamaane main log daakiye kaa shiddat se intjaar kiya karte the
 So we are going to tell you the story of one such post office
 24 farvari, 1984 ko dakshini gangotri main shuru kiya gaya tha
 It was set by India on its third Antarctica tour
 yah post offis khubsuurati kaa doosraa naam tha
 There was talk of this post office located in the snow passes
 is post offis kii sevaayen saal 1990 main roak di gayi jab baari barfbaari kii vajah se yah aadha dab gaya
 It has been declared a historical site today
 dakshin gangotri ke is post offis ko chalyman rakhane ke liye barf pighalaane vaali mashin, clinics, bank counter, storage or leboratory jaisi tamaam suvidhaayen vahaan muhaiyyaa karai gayi thim
 In the first establishment year of this post office, more than 10,000 papers were posted and canceled
 agar kisi ne kaha he ki ek post offis kaa band ho janaa kisi adhyay kaa band ho janaa he to sahi hi kaha he
 
 
 There are 29 states in India in which there will hardly be a state where the farmers do not have any problem but it is possible to think only because every farmer in India is on the road with his own problems, irrespective of his debt
 Or for the right prices of their crops, but farmers everywhere are feeling disappointed
 dekhie aaj tak kii vishesh padtaal
 The condition of onion producing farmers in Rajasthan is so bad that the deteriorating onion has to run in the mandis by selling them for 2 to 3 rupees per kg
 kisaanon ke ghar pyaaz rakhe-rakhe suukh or sad rahi he magar kisaanon ke aansu pochhnevaala koi nahi he
 Knowing the condition of Rajasthan's onion producing farmers, we reached Sikar, the largest onion producing district of the state, where the onion had started reaching the mandis since the time of Holi, this time since the crop is also bumpy, so the prices of the crops are also low
 Seated for months that at least the cost of cultivation will get the price of onion
 tab kisaanon ko 160 rupye prati man mil rahaa tha yani 4 rupye prati kilo ke hisaab se
 But the fruit of waiting turned out to be bitter
 ajtak kii team sikar ke kisaan mandi pahunchi jahaan sade hue pyaaz kii badboo aa rahi thi
 The onion was being trimmed here because the onion was rotting in large numbers
 kisaan babulal apni sari upaj lekar yahaan aayaa he or vyapaaree ne 300 rupye prati quintal ke hisaab se is shart par kharida he ki sade kaa nuksaan hamaara hoga
 When we asked the merchant who bought it, why were we buying such a cheap onion, then his answer was that if the farmer was rotting here, then i will also rot here
 tab kya karengen
 In fact, farmers are bringing onions to the mandi, but traders are not giving more than 2-3 rupees because it is also because the traders know that the farmer cannot keep the onion anymore
 kyonkipyaaz kii fasalko teen maheene se zyada nahin rakh sakate hai
 The onion stays in the open and is being damaged by sunlight
 kisaan badi hi maayusi se kah rahe the ki ham prati din 10-12 ghante kaam karte hai magar hamen kuch nahin miltaa he jabaki 6 ghante aisi main baithne vaala hamaara bhagya banaata he
 We were shocked to see Sikar on his way to Rashidpur
 44 degree taapmaana main sikar bikaner road par tractor par pyaaz lekar kisaan khud bechney ke liye baithe the
 The story of these farmers sitting on the highway with the onion tells how much the onion is crying this time
 rajaraam ne ek hajaar ton pyaaz upjaaya tha tab vyapari holi ke baad iske gaanv aae the or 4 rupye kilo ke hisaab se pyaaz kharid rahe the
 Then it did not sell because the loss of 10 thousand rupees per bigha was being done by selling 4 rupees per fort
 ab mandi gaya to vahaan 2 rupye kilo kharid rahe the
 So he has sat on the highway putting a tractor that i will sell myself
 subah se shaam hone ko ai he magar 20 kilo pyaaz 5 rupye prati kilo ke hisaab se 100 rupye kaa hi bech paaya he
 On the other hand, traders are saying that we cannot store onions
 ye kharaab honevaali fasal he
 Transportation has become expensive from above
 bazaar main itnaa pyaaz aa rahaa he ki hamen hin daam kam mil rahe hai
 In the meantime, farmers of Rajasthan state president Sachin Pilotsekar of Congress arrived in Mandi to talk to all the farmers today and while holding a big meeting, demanded that the BJP should buy the crop at 50% profit to the farmers as promised
 saath hi sawaal uthaaya ki bichauliye kisaanon ko mulya nahi de rahe hai to sarkaar karrvai kyon nahin kar rahi he
 Their koi has not helped the Rajasthan government either
 inhen aanan-fanan main pyaaz bechney pade rahe hai
 However, the Central Government will soon have to think of appropriate measures because after the Mandsaur tomorrow, if the farmers of Rajasthan also start a movement, then it will not be surprising because it is a pain of pain, which will break if not today but tomorrow

 input: PTI In Punjab, the Akali Dal has opened a front against the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party par anti-neshnal or anti-punjab, khalistaan samarthak charampanthi grupon se mili hone or videshon main baithe radical grupon se punjab chunaav ke liye moti funding lene ke aarope lagaaya he
 On Wednesday, Punjab Deputy CM Sukhvir Singh Badal made these allegations at a press conference in Chandigarh and on Thursday his wife and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and heated up the politics of Punjab

 Taking these pictures viral on social media, the Akali Dal accused the Aam Aadmi Party and Arvind Kejriwal of promoting radical groups in Punjab

 unhone kaha ki agar akali dal ke paas koi saboot he to ve pesh kare or soshal media par viral tasveeron ko bhi unhone farji bataakar nakaar diya
 The AAP has also created internal squabbles in Punjab, with the announcement of the first list of tickets for the fast-paced elections, and now the new trouble for the party has increased allegations of funding from their extremists and Khalistan supporters and increasing their closeness

 There are two sensations - the first feeling is the face, the stains are very dark, the hats, the tilism, i do not sing with fear from the truth, i do not sing such a sight, i am not able to meet in the fair of my own city
 i do not sing the song again and again - the second feeling is the new song, i am born with broken wires, the bassist has risen in the chest of the voice Seeing the line of Arunim in the new sprout, all yellow, cuckoo's kuhuk night, i know who will listen to the broken dreams, i will not listen to the sorrow of the broken dreams, i will not accept the rage on the eyelids; doodh main daraar pad gaikhun kyon safed ho gaya?bhed main abhed kho gaya
 The martyrs were divided, the songs were cut, there was a dagger in the heart
 doodh main daraar pad gai
 The smell of landmines in the fields, broken Nanak's verses have risen, is a disturbed bit
 vasant se bahaar jhad gaidoodh main daraar pad gai
 Hatred with your own shadow, hugs are beginning to be out of the way, the path of self-destruction, you are concerned about the country
 baat banaaen, bighad gai
 The milk turned sour

 If you look at it from a distance, everything is fine in Kejriwal's party, even now it is coughing! Won unilateral elections, has become Chief Minister again, Opposition is equal, likes are coming on Facebook, Retweets are coming on Twitter, what else does a human being want from life? Do not understand why there are so many differences in the party? In fact, the irony of the Aam Aadmi Party is that more than votes have stings on them and there are differences in the party more than the leaders

 Restaurant manager Prasenjit Chaudhary in the kitchen was present with Tandoor himself and was trying to fulfill the orders of the customers as soon as possible
 unke shef maance kii vibhinn kismon ko marinet karte hue unhen pakaane-sajaane main mubtila the
 Just then, Sajid Dhanani, managing director (MD) of Hotel Sayaji himself came into the kitchen to surprise them
 dhanani ne choudhary ko bataaya ki graahak kababon ke garm na hone kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Most of the customers were taking out meek in the tandoor kebab
 choudhary chintaa main pad gaye
 As a solution to the problem, Dhanani gave him a simple idea, to make a live grill counter, that is, a way to heat food in front of customers
 dhanani ne ise du it yoraself kaa naam diya
 Chaudhary then took measures to serve around 95 percent of the ready-made kebabs, which the customers themselves could bake on the small grills on each table
 shuru main yah vichaar thodaa atapata laga par yah chal niklaa
 Thus the idea of dhanani and the implementation of Chaudhary led to the emergence of a restaurant chain known as Barbecue Nation (BBQ) in 2006 
 pehla bibikue restaraan bandra ke paali hill main shuru kiya gaya
 From the very first day, the customers received a tremendous reception
 pehle hi kuch maheenon main iske 50 fisadi graahak dobaaraa aane waalon main shumaar ho gaye
 Paras Kochhar, Sales and Marketing Manager, BBQ, says, "many people tried to duplicate our initiative, but they failed because they were trying to cheat customers
 '' ve misaal dete hai ki vigyapanon main analimited pron dene ke vaade ke ulat agar aap graahakon ke saamne zyada subjiyan or chote pron rakh denge to kaarobaar nahin chalegaa
 Kochhar smiles, "dhanani sir said, we want to share happiness among customers
 thagne kii koshish se graahakon ko khushi kaise milegi?''mumbai ke pehle outlet kii kamyaabi ke baad dhanani or choudhary ise adhik kaamyaab banane main jute gaye
 BBQ had 18 outlets in 2011-12, including Delhi and Bangalore, while in 2012-13 it increased to 36
 kochar bataate hai, aaj kii taarikh main is chen ke paas dubai main 5 or malaysia main ek restaraan he or kul 121
 700 crore soon from the company market
 jutaney ke liye ipio laane kii yojana bana rahi he
 The success of the BBQ is also surprising
 salanaa kareeb 24 fisadi vruddhi ke saath khanpan udyog ke liye yah chen ek mile kaa pathar sabit ho rahi he
 What is the secret behind this success? The answer appears in the BBQ menu menu, where the price is judiciously decided by families, as well as the corporate world, as such people usually book for larger groups
 2006 main live gril or phul bufe kaa 450 rupye ke saath tayshuda keemton vaala menu aaj kareeb 700 ru
 Belongs to agar aap bibikue ke kisi restaraan main jaaen to aapako live gril ke liye zulu koriender chikan, peri peri prons, amritsari fish, tandoori wings or doharaa seenk kebab jaise maansaahaari vyanjanon ke saath grield veg, achaari potato, bibikue pinapel, laal mirch paneer tikka, corn kebab, kaashew spiced potato or crispi corn jaise shaakaahaari vyanjan bhi milte hai
 With this variation in the menu, the marinets on the table (the spice used to grill the veg or non-veg) diffuse the shade with a variety of colors
 panile rang kaa garkins and olive, jhak safed lemon garlik yaa phir naarangi rangath liye gadha chile spice jaise marinads ke saath mango mint, tamaato salsa or mayonage jaise sockes aapaki bhukh badha denge
 Hunger is also related to the eyes with the stomach, a beautifully decorated table proves this
 noida ke sector 16 main bibikue ke chif shef khem singh adhikari kehete hai, "ham live gril ke liye bahut saare merinates or sockes uplabdh karaate hai jo logon ko bahut pasand aate hai
 BBQ gives its customers a different feel, from soups to veg-non-veg main courses and desserts
 strawberry or pine apple pastery, chocolate moje, kesar phirani, walnut browni, mango cheez kek fehrist lambii he
 But Kulfi has a special place among them
 bibikue ne sirf kulfi ke liye ek alag outlet kulfi nesan shuru kiya he, jisamen 40 tarah kii topings pesh kii jaati hai
 In 2011, when India's restaurant business was ready to take off, BBQ made its presence felt in important places in the country
 2012 main dhanani ke nidhan ke baad unki jagah unke bhai kayum ne lee
 The chain had 33 outlets at the time, but Qayum was thinking big
 unka kchayaal tha ki bade shahar bhale hi kaarobaar ke lihaaj se mahatvapurn hon par chote shaharon main sambhaavnaaen adhik hai
 By 2016, BBQ added 64 new outlets, most of them in relatively smaller cities such as Madurai and Meerut
 in nae restaraanon kaa aakaar banisbatan chota tha or unamem bhojan bhi bade shaharon ke mukaable 15 fisadi sasta rakhaa gaya tha
 Kochhar explains, "if you take the market of small cities in India, then your success can increase manifold
 ''anumaan he ki 2013 se 2017 ke bich is chen kaa salanaa turnover 170 fisadi bad kar 184 karod ru
 503 crores from Rs
 ho gaya tha
 Kochhar, who returned from the opening of the new restaurant in Gorakhpur last week, gives a brief glimpse of the times ahead: "in the next five years we will be busy opening more restaurants in such small towns
 ''haalanki zyaadaatar bhartiya abhi bhi ghar par khaane ko tarjeeh dete hai lekin shahari logon main baahar khaane kaa chalan bahut teji se badha he
 Today, the market for eaters in the country is about $ 48 billion
 bibikue ne bharat main jamane ke baad antarrashtriya str par pair pasaarne kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 There is one more thing special with the BBQ, here the staff does not take a tip
 kochar kehete hai, "aap kaa man ho to yahaan ek daanpeti he, jisamen tip ke paise aap de den, jise ham kisi enjio ko uske kaamon main madad ke liye de dete hai
 The idea, born in Indore between Dhanani and Chaudhary, took 12 years
 bibikue ne sabit kiya he ki bhartiya bazaar abhi bhi nae prayogon ke liye khulaa he or graahakon main naepan ko lekar utsaah he
 The new type of entrepreneurship in India is still practiced with warmth
 safarnamabibikue kaa pehla restaransaal 2006 main mumbai ke paali hill main shuru kiya gaya thabibikue ke restaraan kii sankhyaaj 121 he, jinamein se 6 videsh main hai
 Their growth has been around 24 per cent annually
 The specialty of BBQ is that you can enjoy the live grill in the restaurant

 What is special? The most important thing about the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana in the scheme is that it provides many facilities with a zero balance account
 is acount main jamaa raashi par byaaj miltaa he
 Along with this, accident insurance cover of up to Rs 1 lakh is given
 modi sarkaar kii is yojana kii world bank ne bhi tarif kii he
 However, in 2017, World Bank reported in a report that only 40% of the accounts are functioning as active bank accounts
 yani in khaaton main hi tranjection hua he
 This is to say that 60 percent of the accounts are inactive
 vahiin world bank kii 2018 main jari ek report main bataaya gaya ki sarkaar ke tamaam prayaas ke baavjood desh ke 19 karod yuvaaon ke paas bank khaataa nahin he
 Pakistan too is ahead of us in this matter
 yahaan bank khaataa na rakhane waalon kii sankhya 10 karod he
 After the announcement of demonetisation in November 2016, the accounts used during demonetisation, Jan Dhan accounts were used extensively to consume black money
 us samay in khaaton main jamaa main achaanak oochaal aayaa tha
 Last year, the Central Information Commission (CIC) had directed the Reserve Bank to disclose the amount deposited in the Jan Dhan accounts of different banks in demonetised notes during demonetisation
 kul jamaa raashi 81,200 karod rupee2014 main shuru hui pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana (piemgedivai) ke tahat april 2018 tak gramin kshetron main 60% bank khate khole gaye
 At the same time a total of 32 nationwide
 41 karod jan dhan khate khule hai
 While the total deposits in the accounts were Rs 81,200 crore
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik disambar, 2016 main jan dhan khaaton main 0 balance khaaton kii sankhya ghat kar 24 fisadi rah gai jabaki disambar, 2014 main yah 73 fisadi thi
 In addition, more than 83 per cent active Jan Dhan accounts (excluding the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Jammu and Kashmir) have been linked to Aadhaar
 in khaataa dharakon ko lagbhag 24
 4 crore rupay cards have been issued
 agar diarect benifit transfar kii baat karen to 7
 It is being used in more than 5 crore Jan Dhan accounts
 bataa den ki desh kaa koi bhi naagarik jan dhan yojana ke tahat bainkon main apana khaataa khulavaa saktaa he
 Under this scheme, accounts of children below 10 years can also be opened
 vah subah to uttar bharat kii aam garmiyon ke din kii hi thi
 On 2 April, when the sun rose, the common people were speculating that some small Dalit organizations have also appealed for a bandh
 ye sanghathan mote taur par do hafte pehle aae supreme court ke us faisle kaa virodh kar rahe the jisamen 1989 ke anusuchit jati-janajati (atyaachaar nivaaran) adhinium ke kade praavdhaanon ko naram kar diya gaya tha
 But by midday, the whole country started feeling the heat of India
 tivi main 10 rajyon kii sadakon par hinsa ke najaare dikhne lage
 The apparently headless Dalit group was clashing with police or upper caste factions
 is jhadap main 11 logon kii jaan chali gai, karodon ru
 The property was destroyed
 isse sirf sarkarein hi hairaan nahin rah gayi, balki is swatahsfoort ubhaar se vipakshi dal bhi notice lene ko majaboor hue
 The verdict of the court was as if it was just a minor spark, in fact, what was shown across the country on 2 April was a reaction to the growing tension between Dalits and upper castes in different parts of the country
 yah ghar kar rahe us dar kii abhivyakti thi ki "vyavastha'' ke vibhinn stambh unhen phir neeche giraane, unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko chhinane kii sajeesh main jute hue hai
 That day, some protesters were actually heard saying that they had come out on the road to protest the attempt to "end the reservation system" in the country
 daliton keliye yah mauka karo yaa maro jaisaa tha
 Vivek Kumar, professor of sociology at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, says, "being a sociologist and from the Dalit community, i can say that it was an expression of the accumulated anger of the humiliated and stigmatized community for centuries
 '' narendra modi kii aguai vaali centre sarkaar kii saamaajik or aarthik nitiyon ne in halaat main koi fark nahin daalaa
 Demonetisation and the violence of cow vigilantes had to suffer the most marginalized Dalit community
 bhaajapa ke dalit saansad udit raaj kaa maananaa he ki 2 april ko ubhare gusse kii kai vajahen rahi hai
 He says, "before this decision, there was a case of recruitment of SC / ST / OBC people in colleges, in which the reservation was relaxed
 is bich, sarkari naukariyon main bamushkil hi koi bhartee hui, jisase dalit naujavaanon main hataasha faili
 Contracting, privatization and disinvestment in jobs also created conditions for relaxation in reservation rules
 iske alaava rohit vemula kii khudakushi or una, saharanpur, koregaanv jaisi utpeeda kii ghatnaayen ho gayi
 We are seeing a mixed effect of all these
 ''vivek kumaar bataate hai ki april vidroh is baat kaa bhi sanket he ki daliton kaa ab rajnatik partiyon kii "maai-baap'' samskruti se mohabhang ho chukaa he—ve ab apane muddon ko uthaane ke liye unka munh nahin taakna chaahate
 Dalits have become more aware of their social and political rights because of their electoral power and education and the liberalization of economic liberalization
 ab rajnatik partiyon ko mudde uthaane dene ke badale dalit khud agenda tay karne lage hai
 The Dalit voice is very clear and quite articulate, as Punjabi Dalit teenager Ginni Mahi expresses in her song Danger Chamar
 bharat ko isaki jhalak 2018 kii garmiyon kii shuruyaat main dikhi
 Perhaps the Supreme Court could not get a sense of "this Danger" on 20 March, when it decided to loosen several stringent provisions of the SC-ST harassment law
 rajnatik yaa nijee vajahon se "nihit swaarthee tatwon'' kii ore se "durupyog ke maamalon'' par gaur karke sarvocch adaalat ne kai suraksha sharten laga deen
 To this, advance bail and "preliminary inquiry" before filing the case were added
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya ki kisi sarkari adhikari ko giraftaar se pehle niyokta se or saamaanya naagarik ke maamle main varisht police adhikari (esaspi) se likhit manjuuri leni hogi
 Ironically, the Supreme Court gave this decision keeping in mind the creation of caste-based society

 The court was hearing the application of Maharashtra Technical Education Director Subhash Kashinath Mahajan against the decision of the Bombay High Court
 hycourt ne mahajan kii us yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha jisamen unhone vibhaag ke ek adhikari par maamla chalaane kii manjuuri dene se inkaar karne par apane khilaaf exiar ko chunauti di thi
 The officer of the department wrote an adverse comment on the working of an employee in an annual confidential report (ACR)
 haalanki, maamla ek adalati faisle kaa tha lekin daliton ke gusse kii aanch centre or bees rajyon main sattarudh bhaajapa ko sahani padi
 The truth is that during the hearing, the Central Government spoke against any laxity in the Atrocities Act
 atirikt mahadhivaktaa maninder singh ne yah to sweekaar kiya ki kanoon kaa durupyog hota rahaa he, lekin kaha ki juthi shikayaton par dand ke praavdhaan ke maamle par sansad main vichaar hua tha
 But the government was of the opinion that the provision of punishment on the people of SC-ST community is against the spirit of the law
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki adaalat ko is mudde par disha-nirdesh jari karne se bachanaa chahie or ki yah maamla vidhayika kaa he
 Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlot claims that contrary to popular belief, the Narendra Modi government has tightened some provisions of the current law
 masalan, teen saal pehle kisi dalit ko baraat main ghode par chadhane se rokane yaa uskaa sir kaa mundan karne ko dandaneey aparaadh banaaya gaya
 However, there was no satisfactory response from the government as to why it took nearly two weeks to file a review petition against this decision in the Supreme Court
 udhar, sarvocch adaalat ne apane faisle par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya he or kaha he ki 20 march kaa aadesh sirf bekasoor logon ko suraksha pradaan karne ke lihaaj se diya gaya, usase kamjor tabakon ke adhikaar kisi tarah prabhavit nahin hote
 However, she also said that she would hear arguments from all parties against her decisions at the next hearing after ten days
 kya kanoon kaa durupyog hua?oonchi jati ke logon kii yah shikaayat nai nahin he ki anusuchit jati ke log unhen blackmel karne ke liye utpeeda kanoon kaa sahaara lete hai
 Pattali Makkal Kachchi, an upper caste Vanniyar dominated Tamil Nadu, has been demanding change of this law for years
 pichley saal puure maharashtra main maratha samudaay ke logon ne aarakshan kii maang ke liye pradarshan kiya to unki ek maang yah bhi thi ki utpeeda kanoon ko naram kiya jaae kyonki marathaon ke khilaaf kai farji maamle darj kiye ja chuke hai
 In response, the Maharashtra police had to submit a report to the state government that there was no clear evidence of misuse of this law
 udit raaj kehete hai, "isamen koi shaq nahin ki kai kanoonon kaa durupyog hota rahaa he or yah kanoon bhi unamem ek he
 So, why did the Supreme Court not give such opinion about other laws? The court has changed the basic structure of the anti-harassment law by adding third parties
 ''supreme court ne faisla sunaate samay iske durupyog ko jaahir karne ke liye rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (enciarabi) ke aankadon kaa hawala diya
 The court said that in 2015 about 15–16 per cent of the total complaints filed under this law were bogus and that year the courts pronounced judgments of release or withdrawal of complaints in about 75 per cent of the cases
 aksar, iske tahat sajaa kii kam dar is kanoon ke kade praavdhaanon main dhilaai kii vajah bataai jaati rahi he
 a 2015 investigation by the Media Institute for National Development (MIND) Trust in Tamil Nadu found that thirty per cent of cases under the anti-harassment law were closed due to "fact-finding"
 matlab yah tha ki police ko hasil vivekadhikaar se ye gadabadiyaan hoti hai
 Vivek Kumar says, "the opposite of abuse is the truth that this law is not fully adhered to
 yah rihaai kii ucch dar se sabit hota he
 For example, in the Bhanwari Devi case in Rajasthan in 1992, the court released the upper caste rapists, saying that boys could not do such misdeeds in front of their father
 ''duusare dalit vidwaan bhi isse sahamat hai ki kanoon ke durupyog kii daleelein behad badha-chadhaakar bataai jaati hai
 Director of Indian Institute of Dalit Studies (IIDS), New Delhi, Prof
 sanghmitra sheel acharya kehete hai, "peediton kii saamaajik prishthbhumi un adhikariyon se alag hoti he, jo daliton ke khilaaf apni dharanaon or purvagrahon ke saath kaam karte hai
 In most cases, the victims are subject to those who persecute themselves
 choti saamaajik haisiyat ke kaaran shikaayat darj karwaanaa bhi mushkil hota he
 There are many ways to take back cases
 isliye aksar rihaai is vajah se nahin hoti ki aparaadh hua hi nahin, balki vajah yah hoti he ki mukademe ladgaye kii saamaajik haisiyat hi nahin rahati
 According to Nandini Sundar, professor of sociology at the Delhi School of Economics, the number of cases filed under this law does not give an idea of the actual number of atrocities as "the police often do not file firs
" '' ve kahati hai, "antat yah kanoon utana hi kargar he jitani police or nyaaypalika or donon hi essi-asti ke prati vyavasthaagat purvaagrah se grast hai
 "the electoral power of the Dalit electorate is very important and no party wants to annoy them in view of the election of four big states this year and the Lok Sabha next year
" 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa kii safalataa iskaa jeeta-jaagta saboot he
 During that time the share of Dalit vote for the party had increased from 12 percent in 2009 to 24 percent
 anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit kul 84 loksabhaa siton main se bhaajapa 40 jeet gai, jisamen uttar pradesh kii 17 siten thim
 According to the Center for Studies of Developing Societies (CSDS), 85 per cent of Dalits across the country voted for the BSP during its height in the early 2000s
 2012 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main basapa kaa dalit samarthan 23 pratishat ank tak gir gaya
 Therefore, the Samajwadi Party won heavily
 phir 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main basapa kaa jatav (mayawati kii jati) samarthan 16 pratishat ank or duusari dalit jatiyon kaa samarthan 35 fisadi ank tak gir gaya
 Hence, the party did not get a single seat
 vidhansabha chunaav main jahaan gaiyr-bhaajapa, gaiyr-congress partiyon kii jeet hui, uske vishleshan se bhi dalit voton kii bhoomika kaa andaja lagata he
 For example, the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha and the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu all received a large number of Dalit votes in their respective states
 telugana main congress se badi sankhya main dalit vot chhitakkar telugana raashtra samiti kii ore gaye to uski sarkaar ban gai
 Dalit votes have been important in bjp's electoral success, while the poor performance in Bihar and Delhi has also led to the slipping of Dalit votes
 bhaajapa ke kai netaa isse sahamat hai ki bihar chunaav ke ain pehle aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan kii samiksha vaale bayaan se rajya main bhaajapa kii durgati hui
 Now that the resentment in the Dalit community increased against the increasing cases of Dalit atrocities and the court's decision, the opposition parties saw an opportunity to make a dent in the Dalit vote bank from the BJP
 is ladaai kaa fori maidan is saal hone vaale chaar bade rajyon karnataka, madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh ke chunaav honge
 Dalit population is about 19 percent of them
 samajashastri dipankar gupta kehete hai, "saamaanya paristhitiyon main dalit ekamusth vot nahin karte, lekin jab koi mudda unhen bade paimaane par prabhavit karata he to vah puure desh main ek jaisaa asar paidaa karata he
 What happened to Dalits in Gujarat will definitely have an impact in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar
 swaabhaavik he ki sabhi partiyaan is mudde ko bhunaane kii koshish kar rahi hai kyonki isse dalit vot ekajute hoga
 Failing to deal with the repressed Dalit outrage, the upper castes started furious counter-attacks
 aksar iske nattejey hinsa or saarvajanik apmaan ke rup main saamne aa rahe hai
 For example, a day after the Dalit protests, violence erupted in Rajasthan
 kareeb 5,000 kii bheed ne ek maujuuda or ek purv dalit vidhayak ke gharon main aag laga di
 There are murders on Dalits having a mustache, marrying outside their caste, marauding in processions and various other types of activities which are considered wrong in the current social system
 sarvocch adaalat kaa faisla bhale fori chinagaari kii tarah aayaa ho, lekin naaraazgi to kuch samay se paidaa ho rahi thi

 In January, there was heavy violence in Maharashtra on the occasion of celebrating the 200th anniversary of the fighting between the Mahar Regiment of the British Army and the Peshwa Maratha Army at Koregaon Bhima in Pune
 is dauraan sirf mumbai main hi 300 log hiraasat main liye gaye or sarkari sampatti ko kareeb 700 karod rupye kaa nuksaan jhelana padaa
 Some consider the program of Koregaon Bhima as a symbol of Dalit identity
 darasal, 2017 main lagbhag puure samay maharashtra main maratha or daliton ke bich jhagade hote rahe
 Maratha communities were demanding to soften the currents of Dalit oppression and to provide reservation for themselves in higher education and jobs
 lekin 2 april ko rajya ke dalit deshvyapee hadtaal ke dauraan shant rahe
 There can be two reasons for this
 ek, kisi badi rajnatik party ne hadtaal kaa aahvaan nahin kiya tha or duusare 26 march ko daliton ne mumbai main bada baari march nikaala tha
 The aim was to arrest Sambhaji Bhide, a Hindutva advocate who instigated violence in Koregaon Bhima on 1 January
 isliye, itane kam samay main doosraa koi virodh pradarshan sambhav nahin tha
 Prakash Ambedkar, president and prominent Dalit leader of the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, admits that the Dalit community was not as aware of the protest
 ve kehete hai, "isaki yojana banaai gai thi
 The message was broadcast on social media and in Hindi

 "the stuck court rule of the BJP has got the Bharatiya Janata Party in trouble, its leaders have also contributed to increase the skepticism of Dalits towards the party's agenda
" 30 march ko bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah mysuru main kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade ke janvari main die dalit virdohi bayaan par ghir gaye
 Shah distanced the party from Hegde's statement to pacify Dalit leaders (hegde compared Dalits to dogs)

 In December 2017, he said that the BJP will change the constitution of the country

 Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DICCI) Vice President Anil Sirwaiah says that "there has been talk of changing the constitution or removing it for the last four years

" 28 march, 2018 ko yogi adityanath sarkaar ne ambedkar kaa middlenem "raamji'' sabhi nirdeshon, sarkari kaary vyavhaar or dastavejon main laane kaa faisla kiya
 Ambedkar's grandson Prakash Ambedkar openly questioned the move

 "damage control" Despite making mistakes from time to time, the Bharatiya Janata Party has made several programs to reach the Dalits in terms of electoral mathematics
 vah us samarthan aadhaar ko khona nahin chaahati jisane 2014 main uski madad kii
 The party is doing its best — from celebrating the birth anniversary of the Dalit heroes to making Ram Nath Kovind the President of the country, it has tried to prove itself to be the benefactor of this community

 According to him, there is a deep communication gap between the Dalit leaders of the BJP and this community
 daliton ke aakraamak hokar sadak par aa jane se sattadhari party duvidha main funs gai he
 In 2017, the Madhya Pradesh government announced a plan to impart training to Dalits as priests, but it was hastily withdrawn due to opposition from upper castes, especially Brahmins, as Brahmin is the bjp's core vote bank

 The ability of Dalits to influence the electoral future of political parties — especially in states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh — has also ensured that parties regularly show their faith in them

 Incidents of blacks beating up blacks in the US in the late 19th century began when they began demanding their rights

 isi avadhi main madhya pradesh, haryana or gujarat main bhi anusuchit jati ke logon ke khilaaf aparaadh main tej badhotaree darj kii gai
 According to Professor Sundar, these increases are a combined result of three factors - the fearless politics of Hindutva, the rise of upper caste hegemony and the increasing claim of Dalits

 ' Mahendra Singh Dhoni stormed into the ground in the 25th match of the current IPL season against Rajasthan Royals and he had an argument with the umpires
 dhoni isisi kii aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke doshi paae gaye jiske baad un par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 Former cricketers have criticized Mahendra Singh Dhoni after this behavior
 purv cricketer or camentator sanjay manjrekar kaa maananaa he ki dhoni ampire ke saath hui apni is bahes ke baad saste main hi chhot gaye
 Manjrekar tweeted, "I have always been a big fan of Dhoni but he has crossed the Laxman Rekha directly
 ve khushkismat rahe ki behad chota jurmaana dekar batch gaye
 Have always been a big Dhoni admirer, but he was clearly out of line walking out like that
 Lucky to get away with just a small fine
 # VIVOIPL — Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) April 12, 2019 Let us know that under the ICC Code of Conduct, dissenting and arguing with the umpire's decision may lead to a test or two ODI ban
 dhoni test cricket se sanyas le chuke hai to aise main yah bain unke vanade maichon par lagu hota
 The Indian cricket team has to play their matches in the World Cup directly after the IPL and a ban on Dhoni could prove to be a big blow for him
 IPL: bedi ne daaga tikhaa sawaal- sirf 50% jurmaana dekar kaise chhot gaye dhoni?30 may se shuru ho rahe vanade cricket world cap main bharat ko pehla pehla match 5 june ko south africa ke khilaaf khelnaa he
 While in the second match, he will face Australia on 9 June
 isisi agar dhoni par do vanade maichon kaa bain laga dena to south africa or australia ke khilaaf vah world cap ke bade match nahin khel pate
 Apparently, MS Dhoni showed unnatural resentment during the IPL match on Thursday night
 isisi ne dhoni ke is vyavhaar ke baad twit kar likhaa ki pichhali raat IPL mukaable ke dauraan emes dhoni kaa aswabhaavik aakrosh dikhaa
 For this he was fined 50% of his match fees
 There was an uncharacteristic outburst from MS Dhoni at last night's # iplgame, and he's been fined 50% of his match fee for it

 Mitchell Santner came to bat after Dhoni's dismissal
 us samay rajasthan royles ke gendbaaj ben stokes gendbaaji kar rahe the
 Ben Stokes bowled Mitchell Santner for the fourth ball of this over, on which he ran and took 2 runs
 tabhi ben stokes kii is gend ko maidani ampiron ne pehle to nobal diya, lekin phir turant hi vah faisla waapas bhi le liya
 After this decision, Dhoni became so angry that he entered the ground and he had an argument with the umpires on the middle ground

 co / ul4cpitiruvia @ ipl— bishwa mohan mishra (@mohanbishwa) April 12, 2019 Bawal on this ball happened because Chennai said that the ball was above the waist and should have been termed no ball
 isi kaaran dhoni bhi maidani ampiron se bahes karne ke liye maidan par aa gaye
 But the umpires did not change the decision
 paanchavin gend par santner ne do ran liye
 Four runs were needed to win on the last ball, here the next ball went wide
 ab aakhri gend par teen ran kii darkaar thi centner ne aakhri gend par chakka maar apni team ko jeet dilaai
 But after this Mitchell Sentner hit the last ball for six to give Chennai Super Kings a four-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals
 isse pehle chennai ne ek baar phir shandaar gendbaaji kaa pradarshan karte hue royles ko saat wicket par 151 ranon par roak diya
 The Rajasthan bowlers made Chennai work very hard to achieve this goal, but Chennai lost the target on the last ball, losing six wickets

 Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress MP and writer Shashi Tharoor said today that Modi calls the country's Constitution sacred, but he also praises Hindutva pioneer Deen Dayal Upadhyay as a hero
 unhone kaha ki donon chijen saath-saath nahin chal saktin
 At the Jaipur Sahityotsav, 61-year-old Tharoor said that there is a dire need for Hindus to stand up and understand what is being done in their name and speak out against it
 purv kendriya mantri tharur ne kaha, ‘hamen sahi ko sahi or galat ko galat kehane kii jarurat he
 We are living in a country where on the one hand the Prime Minister says that the Constitution is a holy book and on the other hand he praises as a hero and instructs his ministries to work, write and teach that Deen Dayal Upadhyay Read and teach those who explicitly reject the Constitution and who say that the Constitution is fundamentally flawed

 'he said,' You cannot have both these thoughts in one sentence

 At the Jaipur Sahityotsav held at Diggi Palace, Tharoor said that Upadhyaya believed that the constitution 'rests on the flawed belief that the nation is a territory of India and all people are in it
 ’tharurne kaha, ‘jabaki vah (upaadhyaay) kehete hai ki yah sahi nahin he, raashtra koi bhu-bhaag nahin he, yah log he or isliye hindu log hai
 This means that you need a Hindu nation and this should be reflected in the constitution, but it does not have these things in it
 ’ unhone kaha ki yahi sabase bada virodhabhas he
 He said, 'you cannot praise Upadhyaya and the Constitution at the same time

 The government has made all the arrangements to deal with the cyclonic storm wind moving towards Gujarat
 lekin, jab chakravaati tufaan bhayaavah rup letaa he to sari taiyaari dhari kii dhari rah jaati he
 Since 1967, a total of 121 cyclonic storms have occurred
 sabase zyada chakravaati tufaan pichley saal aae
 Just last year, 343 people died due to cyclonic storm and there was a loss of about 4000 crores
 sankhyikee or kaarykram karyanvayan mantralay kii report ke anusaar 2018 main desh main ai prakritik aapadaaen, jisamen chakravaati tufaan bhi shaamil hai, unamem kul 2057 logon kii maut ho gai
 46,888 cattle were killed and 915,878 houses were demolished or damaged
 vahiin, 2017 main ai prakritik aapadaaon main 1487 log or 41,965 maveshi maare gaye
 However, 546,518 houses were demolished or damaged
 2018 ke antim chaar maheenon main sabase zyada pareshaan karne vaale chakravaati tufaan aae
 Last year, 7 cyclones were the highest
 varsh 2018 main may main 2, sitambar main 1, oktober main 2, november main 1 or disambar main 1 chakravaati tufaan aae
 On September 19, 25 people died due to Cyclone Day in West Bengal
 6 oktober ko aae chakravaati tufaan titali kii vajah se odisha main 77 or andhra pradesh main 8 logon kii maut hui
 There was a loss of about 7 thousand crores in both the states
 phir 10 november ko chakravaati tufaan gaja aayaa
 52 people died due to this
 13 disambar ko chakravaati tufaan fethai aayaa
 In Andhra Pradesh, 8 people died and about 300 crore rupees were lost due to this storm
 pichley saal uttar bharat main aae chakravaati tufankuch chakravaati tufaan ko naam nahin sirf number diya jaataa he
 These are called low-pressure storms
 26 july 2018 ko aae biobi 03 chakravaati tufaan se uttar pradesh or dilli main tej barish hui
 The highest rainfall was 226 mm in Meerut
 upi main 69 logon kii maut hui
 However, 1500 people were evacuated to safer places in Delhi
 iske baad agast main biobi 05 or sitambar main biobi 06 tufaan aayaa
 Major cyclonic storms from 1990 to 2018 1990 - Andhra Pradesh 1996 - Andhra Pradesh 1999 - Odisha 2008 - Cyclonic storm Nisha 2011 in Tamil Nadu - Cyclonic storm Thane in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry 2012 - Cyclonic storm Neelam in Tamil Nadu - Cyclonic storm Mahasen 2013 in Tamil Nadu - Cyclonic storm in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh Phailin 2014 - Cyclone Hudhud in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh 2015 - West Bengal 2016 - Tamil Nadu Of the cyclonic storms, only 7% of cyclonic storms hit the northern Indian Ocean, out of all the cyclonic storms in the world, only 7% of cyclonic storms hit the northern Indian Ocean
 lekin pashchim bengal or bangladesh ke taton par inkaa asar sabase zyada hota he
 The high waves that arise at the time makes the cyclone more dangerous
 haalanki, bharat kaa pashchimi tat, purvi tat kii tulana main shant he
 According to the Meteorological Department, cyclonic storms that form over the Bay of Bengal are either southeast of the Bay of Bengal or are parts of a cyclonic storm forming over the northwest Pacific Sea, which moves towards the Indian Ocean
 uttar pashchim prashanth sagar par banane vaale toofaan vaishvik ausat se zyada hote hai isliye bengal kii khadi par bhi zyaada toofaan banate hai
 At the same time, cyclonic storms that form over the Arabian Sea are either formed over the southeast Arabian Sea or are parts of a cyclonic storm forming over the Bay of Bengal
 kyonki bengal kii khadi par banane vaale toofaan zamin se takaraane ke baad kamazor pad jate hai isliye aisa kam hi hota he ki ye arab sagar tak pahunchen
 The Arabian Sea is more calm than the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea is colder than the Bay of Bengal, so it does not get many storms
 tufaan se teen tarah ke khatre hote hai, baari barish, tej hawaaen or oonchi lehren
 The most dangerous of these three are the high waves
 gujarat ke aasapaas ke pashchimi tat par oonchi lehren uthne kaa khatra kam he
 On the east coast, we are just above Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West
 bengal kii ore badhate hai to ye khatara bad jaataa he

 The school management objected strongly when a student came to Barabanki in UP wearing a scarf on her head
 saath hi chaatra ko hidaayat di gai ki wo dobaaraa kabhi sir par scorf pahanakar skool naa aae
 When the girl's father sent a letter to the school and wanted to know the reason, the school management said in a written reply that do not question the subject and if there is any problem then enroll the student in an Islamic school
 skool kaa ye farmaan chaatra ke pita ke gale nahin utar rahaa he
 The school has asked the girl's father not to question unnecessarily, refusing to give any kind of exemption citing his dress code
 ye ghatana barabanki ke nagar kotwali ilaake ke anand bhawan skool main hui he
 Anand Bhawan School is originally known as Christian Missionary School
 yahaan sabhi dharmon se jude bachche padhate hai
 In this school, Maulana Mohammad Raza Rizvi's daughter also studies
 ek din ye chaatra skool menscarf pahanakarai to use dobaaraa kabhi aisa nahin karne ke liye kaha gaya
 On this decree of the school, the student's father Rizvi said that this school is considered to be of minorities and most of the teachers and staff are believers of Christian religion
 rizvi ke mutabik islam dharm main ek nishchit aayu takaladakiyonko sir dhakne ke liye sir par scorf baandhne kii baadhyataa he or isliye meri beti skool main sir par scorf baandhakar gai thi
 On this issue, when we talked to the Principal of the school, he said that our intention was not to hurt the feelings of a person of any religion
 pradhanacharya ne ye bhi kaha ki chaatra ko kisi islamic skool main daakhile ke liye majaboor nahin kiya gaya he
 But it is definitely told to the guardian of the student that if they have any inconvenience in the school rules, then they can send their girl out here and send them elsewhere
 pradhanacharya ne ye bhi kaha ki jab koi abhibhavak apane bacchon kaa daakhila skool main karaata he to admician form par skool ke sabhi niyam likhe hote hai
 Parents agree to sign those written rules
 skool kaa apana dress code he, apane niyam hai, jinka paalan sabhi students or abhibhavakon ko karnaa padataa he
 If anyone has trouble following these rules, then they can remove their child from school and this is what i said
 jis chaatra koscarf pahnanese manaa kiya gaya, uskaa kahana he ki wo ab ghar se skool tak scorf pahanakar aati he lekin class main jane se pahane scorf utaar leti he, kyonki ise pahanakar class main jane kii anumati nahin he
 The Delhi High Court has converted a letter sent by undertrials seeking a speedy trial of cases pending in the lower courts for years
 dilli hoicourt ke chif justise rajendra menon or justise age bhambani kii bench ne dilli sarkaar ko is maamle main notice jari karke jawaab maanga he
 The High Court has directed the Delhi government to file its reply by 13 August
 darasal, dilli hoicourt ko kuch vakt pehle paanch vichaaradhin kaidiyon kii taraf se ek khat mila
 In this letter, the undertrials in their complaint said that after several years in their case after arresting them, nothing has been done
 bheje gaye khat par sangyaan lete hue ab hycourt ne is khat par sunwaayee kii zarurat samajhate hue ise janhit yachika main tabdeel kar diya he
 Even after 5 years, the charge has not been framed, one of the inmates who wrote these letters to the Delhi High Court, Ujair Ahmed, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in 2013 and he has been lodged in Rohini Jail for the last five years
 ujair ne dilli hoicourt ko likhe apane khat main kaha he ki unhen jhuthe cese main fansaaya gaya he
 The allegations made by Uzair are very serious
 5 saal bitne ke baad bhi unke khilaaf court main ab tak koi aarope tay nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 Imran Khan, who has been lodged in Tihar Jail since July 2016, has also told in his letter to the High Court that he was arrested by the NIA and a charge sheet was filed against him by the investigating agency in July 2016, but since then in his case Nothing has happened
 iske alaava hoicourt ko khat likhane vaale teen or kaidi bhi 2014 se jelon main band hai or unke maamalon main bhi court main ab tak kuch khaas nahin ho paaya he
 As such, the condition of jails is very bad all over the country and there are more prisoners than capacity in the jails
 yahi haal rajdhani dilli ke tihaad jail kaa bhi he
 Tihar has a capacity to hold about 13 to 14 thousand prisoners, there are more than 3 times the prison capacity
 in kaidiyon main sabase badi sankhya vichaaradhin kaidiyon kii he
 Whenever there is talk of reforms in jails, firstly cases related to these undertrials come, but due to their long standing in court, most undertrials have to spend a long time in jail
 gujarat ke chunaav kii jabardast gahamagahami ke bich kendriya khaadya or aapurti mantri ramvilas paswan ne ek aisa bayaan de diya he jise modi sarkaar ke virdohi hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kar sakate hai
 In fact, when asked about the skyrocketing prices of onions, when Paswan's prices would come down, Ram Vilas Paswan said that "it is not in his hands to reduce onion prices
" 'dilli or kai or mahanagaron main graahakon ko ek kilo pyaaj ke liye 60 rupee se lekar 80 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai, jabaki pichley saal isi samay pyaaj bazaar main 25 se 35 rupee kilo bik rahaa tha
 Tomato prices are also becoming uncontrollable
 pyaaj or tamaato kii keemton ko lekar virdohi lagaataar modi sarkaar par hamalaa bhi kar rahe hai
 On Wednesday itself, Congress leader Kapil Sibal tweeted tweeting that onion being sold at Rs 60 a kg is bringing tears in the eyes of common people, but Modi is talking about Make in India with Ivanka Trump and maybe They have forgotten that tears are also coming out of the people of India
 pyaaj tamaato kii keemton par jab bavaal badha, to buudhvaar ko ramvilas paswan ne iske liye sabhi sambadhit adhikariyon kii baithak bulaai, ye pataa karne ke liye ki keemten aakhir lagaataar bad kyon rahi hai
 After the meeting, Paswan gave several reasons for increasing prices
 jaise ki sabase zyada pyaaj utpaadan karne vaale maharashtra or karnataka main is saal upaj kam hui
 He also said that to curb the prices, the government has stopped the export of onions and to meet the demand, onion has also been imported
 lekin paswan ne mana ki aayaat kii hui pyaaj bazaar tak pahunchane main maheene bhar se zyada kaa samay lagegaa
 Ram Vilas Paswan also had a complaint that in Alwar, near Rajasthan, Delhi, interest is getting 28 rupees per kg
 isi tarah maharashtra ke nasik kii mandi main bhi pyaaj 30 rupee kilon kii dar se mil rahaa he, lekin yahi pyaaj graahakon tak pahunchane main isaki keemat doguni se jyaad ho jaati he
 Paswan also said that the central government is also talking to the state governments so that the government can buy onions directly from the mandis and reach the customers
 unhone ye ummid bhi jataai ki pyaaj kii nai fasal do teen hafton main aa jaaegi or usase bhi keemton main fark padega
 But when Paswan was asked directly how long the impact of any measures the government is taking to reduce the prices of onions will be seen by the customers, Paswan resentfully says that reducing onion prices is not in his hands
 pyaaj kis tarah sarkaar ke liye musiibat ban chukaa he ye tab or bhi saaf ho gaya, jab pyaaj kii keemton ke bare main ajtak nekrishi mantri radhamohan sinhase poocha to unhone sawaal ko taalane ke liye doodh utpaadan ke bare jaankaree deni shuru kar di

 aise main password ko bachaana or khaaton ko surakshit rakh paanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he, lekin ab chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 a computer scientist has figured out a way to save online accounts and keep hackers away
 is yukti ko usne 'jeographical passwords' naam diya he
 Geographical passwords have been invented by Ziyad al-saloum, a computer scientist at zss-research, Ras Al Khama, based in the United Arab Emirates
 yah vibhinn sansthaaon ko ek aisa saral or saath hi vyaavhaarik password detaa he, jisase surakshit tareeke se len-dein ho sake
 At the same time it will also reduce many potential threats associated with existing passwords
 jedeses-research main viksit kiya gaya prototip (pratimaan) system ek system kaa password jaan lene ke baad utpann hone vaale khataron se bachaane main sakasham he
 al-saloum argued that it is far easier to remember a place where you have been long ago than a complex password
 al salom ne jor diya ki paaramparik password ke badale prabhavi password prastut karke data main send lagane kii sambhaavna ko 76 pratishat tak kam kiya ja saktaa he
 This fact is based on an analysis of more than 47,000 security-related incidents reported
 jeographical password system vishesh yaadgaar jagah ke deshaantar, akshansh, oonchai, seemaa kshetra, isaki paridhi, pakshon, kone aadi se utpann bhugolic jaankaree kaa prayog karata he
 Thus, even if two users choose the same place as their geographical password, but their password settings remain different from others

 Is Khwaja's court in Ajmer the place to make a film a hit? This question has been raised by the Diwan of the Dargah

 Do not beg for films because films spread vulgarity
 lekin dargah ke khaadim nahin maanate ki kisi ko dargah aane se rokna sahi he

 hamane dow puja shakun pandey se phone par lambii baatcheet kii he
 Presenting the entire conversation
 aap desh ke pehle kathith hindu court kii pehali jaj hai so pehle apane bare main thodaa bataaie?main mahant dow
 Pooja Pooja Shakun Pandey, i am the Mahanta of Juna Arena
 ghaziabad ke ek college main mathematics kii professor rahi hum
 After teaching for ten years, i joined social work
 raajnneeti se judi or philhal aadhyatm se judi hui hum
 While working, i saw many things that i did not like
 satya ko kabhi hue haarate hue dekha, haara to nahin lekin bahut sangharsh karte dekha
 Saw Talent dying
 maine jameen par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Seeing my work, i was approached by the political party All India Hindu Mahasabha
 agar hamaare yuva, hamaare athical or moral vailuj ko apane andar utaar lenge to aparaadh bahut kam ho jayega
 Are you from Aligarh, no? aligarh se maine apane rajnatik jivan kii shuruuaat kii thi
 i was born in Hisar, Haryana
 mere pita ji ensisi main captain rahe hai
 So i went there wherever his posting took place
 aap jaj kaa kaam kaise karengi? aapaki adaalat kaise kaam karegi?jaj or adaalat bahut bade shabd hai
 We are very simple people
 ham apane sanathan nyaay paddati ko phir se jinda kar rahe hai jo dab gai thi
 Just like Maryada Purushottam Ram used to do justice
 jaise hamaari naarad samhita main nyaayadhish ko hona chahie
 Just as there are methods of justice in Manusmriti, they will do this work by adopting the same method
 paariwarik mudde jo hai, aapasi ladaai ke mudde hai
 There are issues of dowry and there are issues of mutual dispute about money, we will try to resolve them on the basis of what used to happen in the Panchayati Raj
 aapke hisaab se sanathan nyaay paddati he kya?angrejon ne jab hampar raaj kiya to unhone ek book jiskaa naam main abhi yaad nahin kar paa rahi hum ko mana
 This book is in Sanskrit and based on this, we had rules and laws and constitution
 lekin thode samay baad jab unhen laga ki is kitaab kii vajah se to desh main unity bad rahi he to wo phir apana system lekar aae
 But our mythological way is so good that if we bring it, we will be able to improve the culprit through spirituality
 hamen nirnay lene main bhi aasaani hogi
 If you do justice on the basis of Manusmriti, then how will you do justice to Dalits and women? That is a huge gap that we have set up a Hindu Bench
 raajnneetik log hamen dharm ke aadhaar par baantate hai
 They then divide on the basis of caste
